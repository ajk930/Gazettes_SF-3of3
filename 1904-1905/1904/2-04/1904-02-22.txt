RUSSIAN TROOPS DRIVEN BACK WITH HEAVY LOSS
IN OUTPOST ENGAGEMENTS ON THE YALU RIVER
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 21. âI have authority which prohibits doubting the veracity of the report that, in spite of official dispatches stating
that nothing is taking place and everything is perfectly quiet, outpost engagements have taken place on the Yalu, resulting in the Russian advance
guards being driven back with considerable losses, which are estimated at 2800; lives. ' Whether these figures include only those who fell on
the Yalu or the entire Russian losses since the commencement of the war is not exactly clear. - '."'."

WASHINGTON. Feb. 2L â Late to
right the State Department received
a cablegram from Minister Powell,
dated at San Dominso, February 16,
saying:
"A decisive battle has been fought
between the Government forces and the
insurgents. It extended over two days
and resulted in a victory for the Gov
ernment. The siege has been raised
and the insurgents are in retreat."
SAN DOMINGO. Thursday, Feb. 11.
â The Clyde liner New York arrived
here this morning, convoyed by the
United States cruiser Newark, and
Minister Powell instructed the captain
of the vessel to discharge his cargo at
the wharf. An agreement had been
made by Minister Powell and Com
'mander Miller with the Insurgents and
the Government that neither party
should fire while the New York was
at the wharf discharging. The Gov
ernment kept this agreement, but the
â¢insurgents tired on the steamer and on
a launch from the cruiser Columbia,
which was entering the river. Eight
rifle shots damaged the New York's
â¢ woodwork, endangering the lives of
â¢passengers and crew
The commander of the United States
warship then decided to shell Pajarito
near this city, the place occupied by
; the insurgents, and to land S00 marines
Tuth . the object of punishing the in
surgents for insulting the United
States nag and damaging an American
steamer.
.. . At 2:20 the Newark approached and
opened fire, discharging ten shells.
The insurgents fired upon the marines
-while they were landing, wounding
â¢ Â«ome of them. The marines returned
! the fire and the insurgents ran away.
m The marines landed were divided into
â¢ two columns and searched the houses,
yoods and bushes. They then followed
the insurgents, who fired while the
marines were reloading. The result of
â¢'the bombardment Is not known. The
'ICew York left here at 5 p. m. for the
â¢ roadstead after landing her cargo.
â¢ . All is now Quiet and it is supposed
.that the insurgents have retreated a
. considerable distance. Reports from
the interior are favorable to the Gov
ernment. Great misery exists fn the
city for want of food and the arrival
of the Clyde line steamer is a great
relief. The steamer could not land a
â¢portion of her cargo at Monte Cristi,
being prevented from so doing by a
Dominican warship.
; WASHINGTON*. Feb. 21.â A belated
, dispatch, dated February 12, from
Captain J. M. Miller of the

PORT .ARTHUR, Feb. 21.â Sounds of
desultory, firing at sea are heard almost
nightly, i and . this morning firing was
again heard. This is doubtless due, to
the. attempted approach , of Japanese
torpedo-boats, but nothing serious. has
developed.

LONDON, Feb. 21.â The question as

the financial strain caused by the war
without having recourse to a foreign
loan exerts a great influence in the
money markets. It is the general be
lief that, owing to economic conditions
resulting from bad harvests and other

lasts beyond a couple of years that
country will be bound to raise money

SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 21. â While on
his way home this evening Louis
Hughes, the Chief of the local Fire De
partment and the constable of the city,
was held up and because he resisted
was shot at four times. One bullet
penetrated the lower part of his body.
The hold-up occurred on Irwin
street, one of San Rafael'- principal
residence thoroughfares, at a time
when there were many pedestrians
about. The attack was made in a dark
spot under a clump of shade trees.
Hughes defended himself as much as
possible and pulled the trigger of his
revolver five times, but on each occa
sion the weapon failed to respond.
Late to-night Deputy Sheriff George
Martin captured the two footpads near
San Anselmo. One had a bullet wound
in the thigh. They are young men of
good appearance and well dressed. Both
refused to give their names. They are
now in jail here.
/ When Hughes was opposite the
Bogle residence two men passed him.
He hailed them and suggested that if
they were going his way he would ac
company them. At the salutation both
men turned, one exclaiming, "Hold up
your hands!" Instead of complying
Hughe3 reached for his pistol, where
upon the taller man of the two fired
three shots at him. The murderous
couple then turned and ran in the di
rection of the Hotel Rafael. When
they were fifty feet away another shot
was fired,
Hughes was removed to Dr. Howitt'3
sanitarium on Fourth street and
Sheriff Taylor was notified of the hold
up. It is believed that Hughes will
recover. .0':
Hughes' description of his two as
sailants corresponds with that of tha
two masked men who robbed .the
saloon of A. Lawrence at Sausalito on
Friday night Officers have been on
the trail of these men ever since, but
no tangible clew has been obtained.
William Shannon, a saloonkeeper
near West End Station, was held up
to-night. His place was entered atfout
11:15 o'clock. Two other men were in
the place at the time. A young man,
short and clean shaven, first entered
and ordered Shannon and his custom
ers to throw up their hands. One man
refused. Shannon begged him to raise
his hands, but still the customer re
fused, whereupon the second highway
man entered, pointing: two pistols in
the man's face. The customer then
acquiesced.
The first intruder thereupon went be
hind the bar, secured the day's re
ceipts, purloined Shannon's watch,
while the other robber kept the three
men covered.
The highwaymen were not masked.
They did not molest Shannon's cus
tomers and just before making their
exit returned the watch to the pro
prietor. They then left the place and
ran down the road toward San Ansel
mo. The description given by Shannon
coincides with identifications made by
Hughes.

ST. PETERSDUKG, Feb. 21.â For
days past, besides ugly rumors of Rus
eian rr.Islr.17s on lanJ, there have been
current in usually well-informed cir
cles rarr.crs that the extreme displeas
ure of the Emperor has been aroused
by incidents of the night torpedo boat
attack by the Japanese at Port Arthur,
conctrning which much futile abuse
tsainst Japan has been expended in
the mÂ«w>p;iv>ers. Public opinion here
iipptarji to b? that the Emperor ha?
ordered very fuii inquiry to be made.
So far as is known here, en the

Russian style with the effervescent

result in many dismissals and degra-
dations.

said, looked upon as a disappointing
personality, having belied the huge ex

FRENCH FINANCIERS
PLAN MEASURES TO
STEADY THE MARKET
PARIS, Fob. 21.â Prominent financiers
have -been in consultation to-day, and
measures were taken which will be put
into operation to-morrow to prevent
continuance of the depression which
since the opening of the war in the Par
Mast, and particularly on Friday and
Saturday, has charctcrized the Bourse.
The Government is assisting these ef
forts by positively denying that there
is any ground for alarm over further
complications.
The seriuus result of the weakness of
the market Is shown by the estimates
of securities listed on the Bourse, which
have diminished In value about 1,000,
000,000 francs within the past two
weeks. â¢
Since February 6 French rentes
dropped here 3 francs 25 centimes;
Spanish exteriors, 11 francs 10 centimes;
Russian consols, 7 francs; Brazilian 4's,
5 francs 30 centimes; Bank of Paris, 98
francs: Credit Lyonnaise. 87 francs;
Sues, 200 francF; Thomson-Houston, 50
francs, end Rio Tintos, 64 francs.
,. Jt is recognized that something must
be done to stop the reckless efforts to
selL AH the financiers who discussed j
the matter to-day united in saying that
the crisis was pre-eminently produced
by speculation based on the general
fear of complications arising out of the
war between Russia and Japan, and it
was bees use of this that capital had
b*Â»en " timid about intervening. The
financiers who have been consulting to
day propose to act together to uphold
the market to-morrow, and this, taken
with the denial of the sensational re
ports from Berlin and Madrid, is ex
ported to bring about a reaction, or at
least to produce a firmer market.
De VernÂ«Miil, a member of a prom-'
5nent company operating on the Bourse,
calied attention to-day to the fact that
the tone of the Bourse in itself was ex
cellent.
"I believe." he paid, "that very short
ly, from Mon'iay even, the market will
l>e strong and will resume its normal
course."
The correspondent at Madrid of the
Temps cays that in the sessioA of the
Cortes on Monday the Government will
deny the reports of foreign alliances,
which were the cause of the excitement
on Saturday, and will say* that the
movements of troops are only precau
tionary and for the purpose of enforc
ing Spanish neutrality in the war In the
Far Esst.

The official account of "the battle of

his vessel the night following the bat
tle and that the Russian fire silenced
the Asama's fore barbette and wrecked
her bridge. The * Asama transferred
eighty killed or wounded to a transport.
The Japanese Minister on the same
night had an interview with the Em
peror, according to Pavloff's report,
and threatened to occupy the Imperial
palace unless Japanese sovereignty in
Korea were recognized.

The Echo de Paris' St. Petersburg
correspondent says, with regard to
rumors in circulation that the ap
pointment of General Kuropatkin to
the command of the Russian army in
Manchuria meant that Viceroy Alex
ieff was losing favor, that the truth
is as follows
"When the war broke out the Czar
asked Viceroy Alexieff whether he
deemed it necessary to send a general
to command the* troops, and if so whom
he preferred. The Viceroy replied that
he considered it necessary to have a
chief commander of the land troops, but
that he had ' no preference ' as to who
should be selected. The Czar thereupon
asked him whether General Kuropatkin
would be" agreeable, and the- admiral
replied, 'Absolutely; but I- beg your
"Majesty to discharge me from air re
sponsibility for the land operations,
leaving these' to General Kuropatkin.' "
Alexieff retains the viceroyship, hut
General Kuropatkin is empowered .to
communicate directly with the Czar.
While France has acceded to the
British proposal for the * extension of

ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 21.â In spite
01 the ridicule. tast upon the idea from
various sources, once again the Porte
has lent a willing ear to the diplomatic
suggestions of Russia that the Black
Sea fleet should one day be found un
expectedly in the Mediterranean, Tur
key being assured that, this once an
accomplished fact, not one of the pow
ers would have a word to say In objec
tion.
The only difficulty, however, which
lies in the way of an arrangement by
which the Dardanelles could be passed
Is that Abdul Hamid sees that it is in
his power to exact in return terms
which, as much as Russia would like to
get her splendid Black Sea squadron
out, are more than this country can di
gest. These terms are that Turkey be
given a free hand in settling the Balkan
difficulties in the war which the com-
ing months are deemed certain to bring.
This Is the reason why Admiral
Skrydloff, the bulldog of the Russian
riavy and its most Intrepid and most
daring leader, was lately sent for to
coYne to St. Petersburg, the first inten
tion being to appoint htm to the com
mand in the Far East, but the disasters
at Port Arthur rendered his going there
useless and at the same time empha
sized the essential necessity of getting
the valuable Black Sea squadron re
lieved. '- ;*. .:.-â ;
EXPLAINS BRITISH ACTIVITY.
Hence Admiral Skrydloff hurried
back to Odessa, where he was received
with marked ovations, showing fully
that the people clearly understood the
importance of the mission he might be
called upon to carry out.
This also may explain the report of
the feverish haste with which the Brit
ish fleet, including the reserves, is be
ing mobilized, and it also possibly ex
plains the recent quite unexpected note
of Turkey to the powers concerning
Bulgaria, which looks like a prelimin
ary declaration of war against that
country.
, The trans-Caucasian troops are being
mobilized and ordered to occupy the
frontiers of Turkestan and Persia, this
being a strong reminder to England
that Russia" is ready for war over these
two frontiers. '
KUROPATKIX IS POPULAR.
The appointment of General Kuro
patkin, who was yesterday relieved of
his functions as Minister of War. to
the chief command of the Russian
army in the Far East, was gazetted
this morning.
With the possible exception of Gen
eral Dragomiroff, formerly Governor
General of Kieff and later member of
the Council of State, General Kuropat
kin is the most ''popular man in the
Russian army. As a bluff old soldier
who has fought his way up from the
bottom to be Minister of War, he is. the
ideal of the enlisted men. Not one
in the Czar's army has seen more fight
ing and no one can tell a story better..
There Is never a dull moment in his
company, for he intermingles ,. the
humorous incidents of his campaign
with tales of the self-sacrifices of the
men to whom he led with Skobeleff
over the parched wastes of Geok-Tepe
or over the Icy slopes of Plevna.
No one meeting the short, grizzled
warrior In his charming home on the
sunny side of the Moika would guess
the extent of his power or the burden
of responsibility " weighing on his
shoulders. As Minister of War he was
considered a Just chief who gave re
wards and administered punishments
without fear or favor.' It Is small won
der, "therefore, that the Russian army
adores him.;
GRAND DUKES GO TO WAR.
The appointment of General- Kuro
patkin to direct command in the field
has been received\with enthusiasm and
his leadership inspires complete con
fidence that there will be no mistakes
and that Russian arms will be. carried
to success on land.
General \ Kuropatkin will be accom
panied to the front'by'the Grand Dukes
Boris, Alexis,,: Nicholas and . Michael
Nikolalvitch. ' The " Emperor and Em
press gave a luncheon to-day to . Gen
eral Kuropatkin and the Grand Dukes
at the Alexandra Palace, Tsarskoe-
Selo,' and bade them farewell.
' The exact mission of Grand puke
Alexis* is unknown, but it is, undoubt
edly an Important one, as he has been
in supreme command of the Russian
navy, as president of the board of ad
miralty, taking an active part 'in the
negotiations preceding hostilities. He
presided at' the special council' which
prepared Russia's undelivered reply to
i Jap?** '
Alexis 'paid a memorably, pleasant
visit to the United States when/ a
young man. His career as high ad
miral is welf known and brilliant, and
he has always surrounded himsjjlf, with
a notable : staff. The Grand Duke has
been a prominent figure t in two capi
tals. During the busy months of win
ter-he is often seen here walking on
the Grand ' Orskaja, to and from thft
stately- -palace, and in front of the new
admiralty dockyards. Hte favorite re
sort is the yacht club. He spends his
summers in PoLris., ..-
Grand Duke 'Alexis is now in very
bad health, but hte desire to go to the
front could not be resisted. If his
health permits he may exercise general
direction of the naval movements in
the Far East.
BORIS IS A HUSSAR.
Grand Duke Boris is a lieutenant of
Hussars and is considered a daredevil
of the soldier sort. He is likely to dis
tinguish himself in battle and probably
will be on the staff of Grand Duke
Nicholas, After Boris' returned from
the'Unlted* States he bought the palace
foimerly occupied by Embassador Mc-
Cormick.
Grand Duke Nicholas Is 47 years of
age and is considered the foremost cav
alry expert in the Russian army. He
is tall and fair, with a pleasant face.
As the occupant of the responsible post
of Inspector general of cavalry he will
be able to advise General Kuropatkin,
who is an infantry specialist.
is one of the few Grand
Dukes who married a commoner^ and
though his marriage has not been re
corded it Is none the less a happy one.
His wife was the widow of a wealthy
merchant named Bourenin
With General Kuropatkin's appoint
ment as commander In chief of the
army and the presence of Grand Dukft
Alexis In the Far East, the opinion is
strengthened that while Admiral Alex
left may remain as Viceroy, the active
direction of operations will pass out of
his hands.
YANKEE OFFICER CRITICIZED.
The action of the commander of the
United States gunboat Vicksburg, fn
declining to join, the commanders of
other foreign warships in a protest
against the attack of the Japanese
fleet at Chemulpo which resulted in
the sinking of the Russian cruisers
Varlag and Korietz, promises to cause
much discussion here.
The Novoe JVreyma's London corres
pondent cables that the protest of the
British captain against the Japanese
attack, on the ground that it was a.
breach of neutrality, proved ineffectual
because the American commander*
would not assent.
Newspapers here are laying ' great
stress on the personal note of Kurino,
the Japanese Minister in St. Petersburg,
to Count Lamsdorff, the Russian For
eign Minister, on the eve of the notifi
cation of the severance of diplomatic
relations, In which Kurino v expressed
the hope that the rupture would be of
brief duration. They point to this in
cident as a proof that Russia had no
reason to believe that Japan intended
to follow up the rupture with actual
hostilities.
Official news received here confirms
the. report that none of the crew of : the
Korietz was lost.
An immense congregailon attended
the requiem to-day for Count Neirod,
the only officer killed aboard the
Variag. The Count was a great favorite
in St. Petersburg society.
JAPANESE WORSHIPS
NOT DAMAGED EXCEPT
THROUGH ACCIDENTS
TOKIO, February 21.â The rep'orts
from various quarters saying that Ad
miral Togo's fleet was partly,, crippled
in the' operations at Port Arthur are
unfounded. ' It has not been necessary
to send a single large ship to, Sasebo
for repairs. * Two torpedo "destroyers
have beefTdamaged, but not in fight
ing. The Akebono, in attempting to
coal from 'a collier during a* storm,
collided with the Oboro, disabling her
machinery. Both were sent to Sasebo
to be repaired and they will be ready
for service soon.
The' armored cruiser Chigoda has
been docked "at Sasebo' an'd cleaned.
She had been in .-the water for months
and her bottom was so fouled that
her; speed. was impaired. "
1 The â¢ battleship Shikishima, which
was 'damaged ' on the eve of war; was
repaired 1 in- time to participate in Ad
miral v Togo's * attack on * Port -Arthur.
On? February 9 she was . returning , to
Sasebo after the naval maneuvers ahc>j
while changing her berth struck bot
tom. The accident was at first re
garded as serious and it -'was believed
â¢that Japan would have to defer the war
until the Shikishima could be repair
ed, owing to the then evenly balanced
naval strength of Japan and Russia.
When docked it was found that the
damage to the Shikishima was slight
and repairs were effected in a few
days.- The accident was kept secret
and few were informed of it. It was
generally believed that the Shikishima
was still docked at Sasebo and unable
to participate in the attack on Port
Arthur.
Admiral Togo's men were eager to
fight and the men. of the torpedo
squadron who were sent to reconnoit
er at Dalny on the night of February
8 were bitterly disappointed when
they missed the Port Arthur fight and
they have almost demanded of Ad
miral Togo that he permit them to
engage the enemy at the next op
portunity.
Captain Takonouchi, a former naval
attache at Paris, has been appointed
to command the Nisshin and Captain
OJnouyu, late chief of staff of the
Kure navy yard, has been apointed to
command the Kasaga. These are the
cruisers which were purchased from
the Argentine Republic. The Kasaga
has gone to Kure to outfit. She will
be ready for sea in two weeks. , The
Nisshin is outfitting at Yokahama and
will be ready in three weeks. , . ;}'."â ', ;â 
The Russian Vladivostok squadron

ment, however, discredits the report

at Vladivostok.

upon arriving here received orders from
the Secretary of the Navy to return to
Shanghai. When the outbreak of hos

Cooper's squadron to Chefu. Secretary
Moody has ordered all the ships to
Shanghai. They coaled and left imme

sudden departure.
The Russian forces in Manchuria are

Extensive preparations are'being made
at Dalny, Port Arthur, Newchwang

WASHINGTON, Feb. 21.â Adverse
comment by the Russian press of the
conduct of Commander William A.
Marshall of the United States steam
ship Vicksburg before and during the
Russo-Japanese naval engagement at
Chemulpo is received with surprise
here. It Is not believed that he refused
to extend humane aid to members of
the crews of the Russian ships Koreitz
and Variag," which were blown up.
,: No detailed report of the engagement
has \ been received from Commander
Marshall, but the teachings and tradi
tions of the United States navy have
always. been conducive to humane and
generous action at such time." It Is
not known whether, the Vicksburg
picked up any Russian seamen from
the waters of the harbor," but neither
is it known that any of the Russian
seamen perished while Americans
looked on and refused . aid.

HAY PENS A SECOND
NOTE TO THE POWERS
Russian Embassador Expresses His Govern
ment's Satisfaction. With American
Special Dlsputch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21.â Secretary
Hay has addressed to all the powers
with Interests in the Far East a second
note dealing with the neutrality of
China and the desire to limit the area
of Russo-Japanese hostilities
This ' note merely states what had
been accomplished by his previous com
munications initiating the international
effort for the preservation of China's
neutrality. It sots forth the extent to
which Russia and Japan have agreed
to limit the field of war. This, as pre
viously stated, makes the battleground
Manchuria, Korea and the Russian and
Japanese empires.
Hay does hot suggest any secondary
step. He is content with the adherence
of the powers to the principle of Chi
nese neutrality. There will be Issued
at the State Department, probably to
morrow, the memorandum setting forth
the Russian and Japanes answers to
Hay's first note.
STATEMENT BY CASSIN'I.
"Russia gladly and willingly favored
the suggestion 'of Secretary Hay that,
as far as possible, the belligerents in
the Far East war . localize hostilities
and respect the neutrality of China in
the interest of a continuance of peace
ful intercourse with the rest of the
world. My Government expressed the
conviction that Mr. Hay's suggestion
was prompted by motives of the high
est humanity and was mutually advan
tageous to the belligerents."
. This statement was mado by Count
Cassini, the Russian Embassador, in
the course of a conversation at the em
bassy to-night. The Embassador spoke
in general on the Far Eastern situa
tion. Although' the negotiations on the
neutrality proposition have been car
ried on almost entirely between the
several foreign Governments addressed
and the American envoys accredited
to them, the weight of the work of the
Russian Embassador in Washington in
the councils of the Czar was strongly
influential in the shaping of Russia's
reply.
As soon as the note was addressed
to the Russian Government Count Cas
slnl was advised of the fact by Secre
tary Hay, and a long and earnest con
versation followed on the motives of
the Washington Government in initiat
ing this move, unique in diplomacy. To
the frankness of this conversationâ a
frankness made possible by the cordial
and intimate relations which Mr. Hay
and Count Cassini have enjoyed in
Washington â is largery due. it is said,
to the prompt response of the Russian
Government, which Is materially con
cerned with many matters of the grav
est Importance, and some demanding
the "most speedy attention, such as war
measures.
XATIOXS STILL FRIENDLY.
"It is fortunate," continued the Em
bassador, "that, whatever may be the
feeling here and there in the United
States of sympathy for Japan, the tra
ditional â and, so far as Russia is con
cerned, the highly prizedâ friendly re
lations between the Washington and
St. Petersburg Governments in no way
have been Interfered with. Every mail
brings to the embassy some fifty to 100
â¢contradictions, in the form of offers of
assistance, medical and military, of the
statement that Russi- is without
friends In this country.
"It is so in this country as in every
other, that the smaller nation in the
struggle can count on a certain amount
of sympathy, .arising solely from the
fact ot its minority; but it is a tribute
to the fairness of your Government
that the official conduct of your Gov
ernment certainly has been all that
either belligerent could expect in the
preservation of the strict neutrality
which the President directed shall be
observed by his people.
"So numerous have these offers of
medical and other aid' become that I
have felt It my duty to bring them to
the attention of my Government. It
is possible that. In recognition of the
kindly spirit of humanity and friend
liness which is evidenced by the Amer
ican physicians who have offered their
assistance, my Government may find
a way to accept some of them, and
that American jAiysicians and nurses
may aid us in caring for the wounded
in the Far Eastern war. I am dally
expecting an answer from St. Peters
burg on this point."
WILL NOT SUPPRESS NEWS. -
"What will .be the effect of the re
moval of the censorship on all news
from St. Petersburg to the outside
world?" the Embassador was asked.
"It is believed that this will effect
ually diminish the number of canards
which have been secretly sent from
Russia, especially to England and the
United States, about my country. Cen
sored dispatches were wrongly consid
ered abroad as having the approval of
the Government. Nothing could have
been further from the truth, . unless it
was the additional false Impression
that uncensored dispatches represented
the facts as they were.' 1 With the cen
sorship removed it is hoped that the
outside world, will have a better Idea
of my Government and my people. It
was gratifying to hear from a repre
sentative American several days ago
of the approval in this country of the
policy which had been strictly adhered
to, of making public the news from the
Far East, whether good or bad.
"In the earnest hop_e that peace
might be preserved with Japan, my
government was giving more attention
tb ; the methods by which a diplomatic
settlement might be rtached than to
preparations for the recourse. to arms
which we are now convinced Japan had
determined upon at the outset of the
negotiations. For this reason the first
chapter in the Far Eastern war has
not been characterized by Russian vic
tories.
HERO OF THE VARXAG.
"The truth has been made public as
rapidly as Admiral Alexieff's dispatches
have been made known to his Majesty.
In the first chapter, however, is con
tained a picture which it was to be
expected,' the Americans were quick to
appreciate and applaud. I refer to the
noble conduct of the captain of th-j
Varfag, who, after refusing to sur
render his ship, came out of the harbor
of Chemulpo to face an overwhelming
force of Japanese warships, to whose
fire he replied as effectively as he could
and then blew up his own ship, that
she might not* fall Into the hands of
the enemy. The contribution of such
a page to Russian history more than
compensates for any losses sustained
by our navy as a result of Japan at
tacking us before a declaration, and
Tvhile her envoy in' St.. PetersUurg was
still enjoying the courtesy and pro
tection of the Russian Government.
"The Asso'ciated Press^ dispatches
from St. Petersburg have correctly re
ported the tidal wave of national feel
ing and enthusiasm which has swept
over my country. No longer is the
struggle In the Far East a political one.
interesting for the most part diplomats
and statesmen. It has flared up into a
national war. My august master has
shown extraordinary patience in en
deavoring to arrive at a settlement
without war. But, now that Japan has
made war, the determination of ' tHo
Russian Emperor and his people that
she shall be satisfied with that for
which she has seemed so anxious. Is
made all the stronger by the patience
and forbearance which have hitherto
characterized our dealings with the
Japanese. -'J*." .
"In the interest of the world's hu
manity I am confident all nations will
hope for the success of Secretary Hay's
effort to limit the deplorable war to the
belligerents now engaged." '

Big Deals and Pocketed Large
Sums by Sacrificing Realty
SpectsJ Dispatch to The Call
' LOS ANGELES, Feb. 21.â As the cul
mination of detective work which has
â¢been In progress since last September
ajid which has been participated in by
officers of haif a dozen cities through
out the country, Carl Anderson, alias
D. S. Spring, alias J. H. Johnson, alias
half a dozon other names, one of the
moEt extensive land swindlers who has
ever operated â with California realty as
his 6tock in trade, was arrested short
ly before midnight and made a confes
sion of his guilt. The arrest is consid
ered one of the most important that
nas been effected here In years. It is
not a local case, but the man is said
to have been operating in many cities
fi-nd the magnitude of his operations
have been such that he has been deal
ing in property worth hundreds of
thousands of dollars. Time and again
did the officers in various places think
â¢they had him, but he slipped through
their fingers, leaving some dupe to take
the consequences.
According to his own confession,
Anderson has been the head of a syndi
cate of swindlers who, throughout the
Middle West, have been advertising
California property in exchange for
property in that section. Their plan of
operation was simple. They would ex
amine the title to California property.
find it clear, secure forged deeds and
forged acknowledgments and really
file them for record here. Then, with
the abstract of title clear, they would
negotiate in various cities for other
property. Once the deal was consum
mated they would dispose of the- newly
acquired property at a sacrifice, pocket
the proceeds and move to somejother
city to repeat the operation.
The deal for which Anderson was ar
rested was the transfer by means of
forgred deeds of property owned in this
part of the State by Mrs. Mary Gri.<=
wold. whose ton v.as killed by robbers
in the attempt to hold up a Santa
llonica electric oar here two years ago.
Anderson traded her property to W. R.
Homan. a wealthy citizen of Omaha,
securing ?72<X> cash and a mortgage for
nearly as much more. He sold the mort
â¢gaze ar<3 moved to Kansas City, where
ho dealt in property in many of the
srrralif- r towns throughout Kansas, Ne
braska, Io\vÂ» and Missouri, using
â¢forged de*Â»ds to Mrs. Oriswold's prop
ertv. Then he went to Chicago and re-
peated the operations.
He returned here about ten days a?ro
and under the name of D. S. Spring
has been living at Long Beach. His
manner of securing the forgeries was
to induce a female member of his gang
to- represent herself a? Mrs. Griswold
fcefore a veil-known notary public here
and secure the latter* s attestation to
rhp signature. Papers found among his
eJTects show that he was interested in
the transfer of 25.000 acres of land near
Beaumont, Ter.. ar.d he holds five notes
for $7000 each signed by W. P. Bowles

JAPAN TO SINK RUSSIAN CRUISERS
Continued From Page J, Column 4.
the Russian naval forces In the Far
East badly scattered, there has been
much speculation as to what would be
come of the Russian cruiser at Shang
hai. The agreement of the powers to
preserve neutrality in China makes this
question vitally important.
A neutral power has the right to or
der warships of a belligerent from its
borders. If China, exercising this priv
ilege of a neutral power, is not able to
enforce its demand, the powers that
have agreed to preserve and make ef
fective the neutrality of China, it is
believed here, will be bound to back
up the Chinese position, provided that
that position is sincerely directed to
ward the maintenance of neutrality.
It is pointed out that if the Russian
cruiser remain at Shanghai the Jap
anese fleet probably will swoop down
upon that port and attempt to go in
and destroy the Russian cruiser, as
was done at Chemulpo, where lay the
Variap: and the Korietz.

NEWS OF HIS APPOINTMENT
FINDS JUDGE GARBER SICK
Distinguished Jurist Is Too 111 to Discuss for Publica
tion His Selection for Panama Canal Commissionership,
but It Is Ascertained That the Honor Was Not Expected
EMINENT SAN FRANCISCO LAWYER WHO HAS BEEN CHOSEN BY
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT TO SERVE AS ONE OF THE SEVEN
MEMBERS OF THE PANAMA CANAL COMMISSION.
Local political and legal circles are
much interested in President Roose
velt's announcement that he had de
cided to appoint Judge John Garber a
Panama Canal Commissioner, pro-
viding the distinguished Jurist would
accept the position. While the friends
of Judge Garber hope he will not re
ject the tribute to his professional and
personal worth thus tendered by the
nation's chief magistrate, and are urg
ing him to accept it, his decision is not
likely to be made public for some time,
as he is sick abed at his home, in
Berkeley, and in no condition to give
the subject the consideration its im-
portance demands.
Judge Garber was too ill to be inter
viewed yesterday, but from a member
of his household it was learned that the
news wired to him by Senator Perkins
caused a complete surprise, as the re
cipient of the dippatch had given the
matter no thought. A few months ago
there was a newspaper report that
Judge Garber had been recommended
to the President for appointment to the
Canal Commission; but, as the story
wns not authenticated, it was not given
serious attention by its subject. The
intelligence from Washington last
Saturday must have been made all the
more surprising to Judge Garber by
the fact that he had not been recom
mended by Senators Perkins and Bard,
although they at once admitted to the

PORT TOWNSEND, Wash., Feb. 21.
âThe news reached here to-day that
on Friday while the revenue cutter
Arcata was lying at the Friday har
bor dock her crew amused themselves
by shooting at passing ducks with a
rifle. A bird passed over the vessel
and a coal passer named Alfred Goebel
leveled his rifle at it Just aa William L.
Sayre, one of the warrant engineers,
came into range. The heavy bullet
ploughed through the head of the un
fortunate man, entering at the base of
the skull and coming out at the mouth,
killing him Instantly. The Coroner's
Jury exonerated Goebel, who is fran
tic with grief. Sayre had been several
years In the revenue service and left
a wife at San Francisco.

MODESTO. Feb. ? 21. â J. W. Briggs
committed suicide here to-day shortly
before noon.' He was visiting relatives
and was to have gone to Lodi to at
tend the funeral of a nephew this af
ternoon. Just before train time he
left the home of his brother-in-law
and went to a hardware store, where
he purchased a revolver. Saying fare
well to the salesman he placed the re
volver to his head and fired a bullet
through his brain. Death resulted im
mediately. No cause for the suicide
is known. Briggs had been chief engi
neer of the Pinole Powder Works for
six years. He leaves a.wife, a son and

President his fitness for the place. In
deed it looks as if Judge Garber were
the President's personal choice, the re
sult of an esteem won when he was in
Washington, about a year ago, on Su
preme Court business and became ac
quainted with the President, the late
Senator Hanna and other men close to
the administration.
. It is generally believed that Judge
Garber's proved legal ability was his
chief recommendation to the President j
for the the commissionership. for legal !
as well as engineering talent will be
needed on the commission. Indeed the
enactment of laws for the government
of the canal zone is likely to devolve
upon the commissioners, and one good
lawyer at least will be necessary on the
board.
It was given out last evening at the
Garb?r residence, in Berkeley, that
Harry T. Creswell had spent the. after
noon with his sick law partner, and
'that he would probably be able to fur
nish some enlightenment as to Judge
Garber's intention as to the appoint
ment. At the Creswell residence, .on
Webster street in this city last night,
it was announced that Mr. Creswell
had returned from his visjft a very sick
man. and that his physician forbade
him talking to any one.
The President will Eend his seven
nominations for ianal commissioners to
the Senate next Wednesday, the day
after the ratification of the'' canal
treaty.

the disposition of the body. ~ .V'
Calhoun occupied a responsible posi

of the county, he followed her. Ar
riving- there, he learned that she had
gone to a dance, and he followed her.
She repulsed his advances and refused
to ride home with him. He followed her
in his own buggy, and when she agreed
to talk to him he demanded that she
return at once to Los Angeles with
him. When he threatened her she
coolly replied that she was not afraid
of him. With the remark that he
would make her remember that night
as long as she lived he then blew out
his brains. \^

body ar.d when her relatives reached
the porch it was Supposed that both had
been shot. Calhoun died instantly. Miss

SANTA ROSA. Feb. 21.â This city

generous downpour. Beginning with a
fine mist early in the morning, the rair.
ipcreased until it became quite a storm
during the afternoon. There has been
no cesÂ«ation at any time during the
day. The record for the present sea

instead of praying for rain, as South
ern California has been doing, this city
will soon be compiled to ask for a
cessation of the downpour. The pres
ent rain is seriously retarding farm
work in this vicinity. The ground was
getting into good condition for culti
vation before the present rain, but it
will require several days now to regain
its former condition before farmers will
bo able to plow. Grass is making
pplendid headway and fs many Inches

better and everything points to a most
successful season for fruits and grains.

F. II. Pitman, superintendent of the

two burglars at his home last night, at
1601 Oxford street. Only an Oxford
street car that happened to be passing
paved the men from cap'.ure, for they
boarded if just in the nick of time, and
wore whirled away to safetv.
Pitman hoard a noise coming from
the first floor of his. home at 9 o'clock

pistol in hand, to see what it was about.
When he looked into the front room he
saw two men trying to raise the win

Before Pitman could get outside the
front door to lire at the fugitives a
car came along on Oxford street, and
the "burglars hurriedly placed them
selves between Pitman and it to pre

the car reached them, they got aboard
and rode away, leaving Pitman very
much chagrined.
The conductor of the car noticed that
the men arted suspiciously, but did not

o'clock the -thief effected an entrance
by smashing a glass panel in a side
door and turning the lock from the
inside. In the breaking of the glass
panel the burglar must have cut his
hand, for there were spots of blood on
the floor of the rooms he Visited and
on the bureaus he opened. The thief

of the residence revealed traces of gore
in the rooms ransacked, and this leads
the authorities to believe that the bur
glar is the same one who entered the
Branch house. There was a lot of sil

the Koch residence. The burglar used
a jimmy in prying open the front door.

Professor Svante August Arrhenius Accepts Invitation to
Lecture at Summer Schoof of State University, Making
Fourth of Famous Scientists to Promise Their Services
DISTINGUISHED PHYSICIST WHO HAS ACCEPTED THE INVITA

IN THE ACTIVITIES OF THE NEXT SUMMER SCHOOL.
BERKELEY, Feb. 21.â Professor
Svante August Arrhenius, the world's
greatest physicist, has accepted the in- (
vitation of the University of California
to participate in the activities of the
next summer school at Berkeley: This
means there will be brought together
in California four of the first scientists
in the world â Profcr.sor Jacques Loeb,
the biologist; Professor Hugo de Vrfes,
the botanist; Sir William Ramsay, the
chemist, and Dr. Arrhenius, the physi
cist. Such a gathering of great think
ers and investigators could hardly be
secured elsewhere in the world and
Californians next summer may. have
the opportunity of hearing these men
in the lecture room and laboratory.
Professor Arrhenius occupies the
chair of general physics at the Univer
sity of Stockholm, Sweden, besides
which he is at the head of the National
Serum Institute of his country. His
studying was conducted in part under

This scientist first achieved distinc
tion through the publication of his elec

which in brief is an explanation of the
manner in which electricity separates
many substances from their elements.
The problem had received attention
from other investigators, but Professor
Arrhenius was the first to propose a
theory which would account for the
results obtained by himself and others'.
A complete revolution was then
worked, both in pure and applied

FOOTPAD BEATS
YOUNG WOMAN
After Attempting to Rob Her,
Brutal Alameda Highwayman
Strikes Miss Kate Cronin
SHE MAKES BRAVE FIGHT
Brutal Assault by a Thief,
Who Was Not Content With
Taking Hard-Earaed Money
ALAMEDA, Feb. 21.â Struck full in
the face repeatedly with the hard fist
of a footpad and knocked into the gut
ter, Miss Kate Cronin pluckily fought
off her assailant last night and by her
screams for help scared him so that
he ran from the scene of the attempted
holdup and escaped in the darkness.
The young lady's eyes were blackened
by the cowardly pummeling she re
ceived from the highwayman, but she
bravely held on to her purse, which the
thug attempted to wrest from her.
The encounter occurred at 12:C0
o'clock last night on Santa Clara ave
nue, near Pine street. Miss Cronin had
alighted from an electric car at the
corner of Santa Clara avenue and Park
street, having come from Oakland,
where she visited friends. She was
proceeding easterly along Santa Clara
avenue to the home of Mrs. Franz Col
lischonn, on Everett street and Central
avenue, where she is employed as
housekeeper. When Miss Cronin left
the. car on Park street she observed a
man standing on the corner, near the
office of the Alameda Land Company.
As she proceeded on her way home
ward he followed her. Near Pine street
she became alarmed and turned upon
her pursuer. As she did so he grabbed
at her purse and hit her several times
in the face,\ knocking her into the gut
ter. She cried out for assistance and
her assailant fled. Miss Cronin arose
and went back to Park street, -where
she met two gentlemen and told them
of what ' had happened. They con
sented to escort her to the Collischorm
home after she said that she did not
desire to report the affair to the police,
dreading the notoriety it would bring
her.
When seen at the Collischonn resi-
dence Miss Cronin said
"I first noticed the man when I got
off the car on Park street. When I
started to walk along Santa Clara ave
nue he followed me, but said nothing
that I heard. Near Pine street he
grabbed my purse as I turned to see
how close he was to me. He struck me
in the face a number of times and
knocked me down. Then I screamed
and he took to his heels. He was a
man below medium build with a dark,
pointed beard, and wore glasses. He
walked with a stoop and wore a dark
square-cut coat and black derby hat.
I think I would know him if I were to
see him again."

SOUTHERN TRIP
IS OF BENEFIT
Visitors to Los Angeles Sec
Good Result of Concerted
Effort for Its Improvement
SECRETARY IS SATISFIED
Edwin Stearns Says That the
Board of Trade Excursion
Has Accomplished Much Good
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Feb. 21.
The recent excursion to Los Angeles,
given by the Oakland Board of Trade,
has done much to stimulate those who
visited the southern city to an effort
to secure needed" improvements for
Oakland. They have seen that the peo
ple of Los Angeles have been able to is
sue bonds for the improvement of the
city and that the improvements have
been rapidly accomplished. The ex
cursion has also awakened new inter
est in the Oakland Board of Trade and
many of the business men that took
advantage of the excursion to visit Los
Angeles have, since their return, made
application for membership in the or
ganization. Edwin Stearns, secretary
of the board, is well satisfied with the
results of the excursion. He said:
It would be hard at present to estimate the
benefits of this trip to Los Angeles. Every
one that went on the excursion has returned
full of enthusiasm regarding the future of this
city. Our natural advantages are so far aheaii
of those ot'Lo? Ang*:!fs that no one can fall
to appreciate the good that may be accom
plished by a ccncr-rtetl effort on the part of the
citizens of Oakland. One of the direct results
of the excursion is a renewal of Interest In the
Oakland Hoard of Trade. At the meeting: of
the directors last Friday forty-one new names
were added to our membership roll, and sev
eral applications are now on file.
Even the ladles that went on the excursion
are eager to aid in the improvement of this
city, ami a number of them are already con
sidering the organization of a Ladles' Auxiliary
Improvement Association.
Emil Lehnhardt said:
The lesson of getting together has been thor
oughly taught, and the citizens of Oakland
will lend every aid in their power in carry-
Ing the bonds for city improvements. One
thing that struck me very forcibly while in
I.ios Angeles was the fact that the San Fran
cisco Call was the only paper to be had In
the south that contained any news of this
city.
Walter E. Logan said:
"We ought to build a special crematory for
the benefit of the mossbacks cf this city, and
then Oakland would stand a chance of going
ahead.
James J. O'Toole of the Elmhurst
Realty Company is enthusiastic over
the prospects of that suburb of Oak
land. He said:
In common phraseology, real estate business
is lively in Elmhurst. In reviewing existing
conditions, it can be sa'd that the dÂ«mand for
property, both improved and unimproved, dur
ing the last twelve months has given a stimu
lus to the rpal estate business that looks well
for the current year. During the summer
months of the year llMiS there was not a va
cant house In Eimhurst, and the statement
that not less than one hundred people seeking
rental proDerty could not be accommodated
during that year is a very conservative esti
mate.
While the climaMc conditions of Elmhurst
are such that attract all classes of people,
and it is a fact that desirable modern resi
dences with spneious grounds have netted their
owners from $'240 to $400 per year, there are
many pretty and comfortable cottage homes
to be had from $10 to $15 per month. A vital
point worrh consideration â vital to the inter
ests of this section â I* the proposed railroad
development approaching Eimiiurst, a leading
factor that is quickening real estate values
and increasing the population steadily.
It is safe to say that there is at this time
being concentrated the attention and effort of
railrcad capital in the direction of Elmhurst
from two distinct sources. For this there is no
cause for query or comment; indeed it is
rather cause for wonder that this co'ndltion
has not obtained sooner; it will require but a
thought and a slight understanding of condi
tions to convince any one that In the present
rapid growth of the â¢'suburbs of Oakland"
Elmhurst is destined to become one of the
most thickly populated districts surrounding
the bay. These statements being true, it \/
evident that as competition and rivalry In
transportation become sharpened and Intensi
fied Elmhurst will attract attention and de
velopment.
At present there exists an activity in the
bulldlns line and sanitary improvement in
Elmhurst rnor* marked than has ever before
been known tn Its history: the subdivision
of a number of large tracts of land, the build
ing of many new houses, an adequate addition
to our public school to be voted for by the
people (and which will undoubtedly carry),
the contemplation of the erection of another
lodge and assembly hill and several new stores
and the construction, now under way. of a
modern sewerage system (by private capital)
sufficiently large to drain nearly the entire
district. The Inquiries through the mail in
numerous quantities daily denote that develop
ment hus tegun, and I am convinced that the
future prospects for the growth of Elmhurst
are good.

So manv activities are scheduled for
woman's day at the University of Cali
fornia to-morrow that the Father of
His Country will not get a chance to
march his revolutionary hosts across
the campus. And instead of its wonted
holiday quiet the university will take
on more of the work day clothes and
show how even a holiday can be dese
crated by labor and pleasure.
In the first place the women students
are going to place on the market the
literary production of the college year â
the woman's number of the Occident.
This paper has been compiled by Miss
Virginia Whitehead. its editor, and a
corps of assistant editors. Those that
have seen it say it surpasses any of the
efforts of thÂ» men. The number will be
put on sale at the Occident office during
the day, and in the evening it will have
a booth all by itself in Hearst Hall.
Then there will be the basket-ball
game between the alumni and the var
sity teams on the Hearst Hall courts.
Everybody will be allowed to see the
game, men as well as women, and a
swift contest Is expected. The teams
will line up the following players:
Alumnae â Miss Alice Farm, Miss Emma Sto

There will be tennis games in the aft
ernoon., but the names of those tnat
will pfay will not be known until to
morrow. A game for the college cham
pionship had been aranged, but an ac
cident to one of the contestants made a

ORIGIN* OF THE BAGPIPE
SAID TO BE ENGLISH
One Englishman Qnirkly Kcsctits tho
Imputation as an Outrode oo
His Peonle.
The conference of the Incorporated
Society of Musicians was held recently
in the Athenaeum Hall, Glasgow. Dr.
Daniel Ferguson Wilson of Glasgow,
the chairman for the day, in an address
on "Folk Music of Scotland*' said it
was on record that in the twelfth cen
tury the people sang songs and used
for their delight the harp, the tabor
and the choro. There was some differ
ence of opinion regarding- the identity
or the choro. Some thought it was the
bagpipe, while others argued that it
could not be. for they maintained that
this Instrument was not imported from
England until at least a century after
this date. Judging by appearance, he
was disposed to think that the choro
was the bagpipe, for it would have been
a sorry sight for a historian to witness
a Highlander wandering in his native
straths and glens with a harp in hl3
hand. Even although it was conceded
that the English introduced the bag
pipes to theÂ«Â«e isles, it must be admitted
that whenever the Highlanders gained
the acquaintance of the instrument
they made the most of it. Dealing with
the question why Scotland hart not
taken her place among the musical na
tions of the world, a recent writer had
given it as his opinion that the bagpipe
was the cause of her undoing, but it
was more probable that the cause lay
In the lack of environment. Scottish
music, however, had at length ob
tained, an entree to the best society,
chiefly German, and great hopes were
entertained for It.
Dr. Cummings of Guildhall School.
London, said he was sorry to hear that
i the Scots had got the bagpipe in Us
present state of perfection from Ens
land. For the sake of the sins for
which they would be punished here
after he hoped that the English did not
invent the bagpipe.â London Telegraph!

TRADE GROWING
IN THE ISLANDS
Report for Last Year Shows
an Increase of Exports
and Imports in Philippines
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21.â The devel
opment of the Philippines commercially
and industrially for the first nine
months of_1903 is_the subject of a spe
cial Dulietin Dy tne I3ureau of Insular
Affairs. It is shown that both in Im
ports and exports there was an increase
compared with a corresponding period
in the preceding year. Heavy exports
of hemp and copra, offsetting heavy
lmports of rice, explained the increase
during the period named. The imports
were 526.601.C10. against $24,338,322 for
1902. The exports amounted to $23,
563.128, an increase of nearly four and a
one-half million dollars. The rice im
ports were the only ones that Increased
and there was a falling off In general
trade, the United States losing 10 per
cent and the United Kingdom 16 per
cent, while Spain has only two-thirds
of the amount of her trade in 1902.
United States exports increased from
$7,232,411 to $9,368,066, and the trade
with Spain was practically the same,
but a small part of this being carried
under the American flag, and all but
5 per cent of the general trade of the
Islands is done In foreign bottoms.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL', MONDAY,. 'FEBRUARY 22, 1904.
GETTING READY
FOR CONCLAVE
Preparations for the Reception
of the Knights Templar Who
Will Pay a Visit to This CiV
AN ELABORATE PROGRAMME
Visitors Will Be Welcomed at
the Several Depots by Com
panies of the Local Knights
The arrangements for the entertain
ment of visiting Knights Templars and,
their families and friends who will at
tend the triennial conclave in this city
next September are assuming shape.
At the meeting of the executive com
mittee reports were submitted by the
various committees outlining an elab
orate programme of greater variety
and attraction than has ever been at
tempted for any former event in the
history of San Francisco. Every fea
ture and each detail is designed to de
light the visitors from near and far.
The principal thoroughfares of the
city are to be decorated In the most
artistic manner. The illuminations
will outshine anything ever seen in this
or perhaps in any other city. Neither
effort nor cost will be spared to im
press the visitors with California's
generous hospitality, the good taste
and Judgment of Its people and the
earnest desire to show the progress
San Francisco has made since the for
mer conclave, held here twenty-one
years ago.
From information received from all 1
parts of the country, east and west of
the Rocky Mountains, it is estimated
that fully 25,000 Sir Knights will be in
San Francisco during conclave week
and probably three times as many
more visitors who will be drawn to
San Francisco to feast upon the mag
nificent display of the great metropolis
of the Pacific.
RECEIVING THE GUESTS.
Designs, plans and specifications for
decoration and illumination, for excur
sions and for all other kinds of enter
tainment are under consideration, as
the committee is determined to have
all plans perfected and the exact cost
settled months before the conclave.
The city will don its festive attire sev
eral days before the commencement of
conclave week, though the actual
work for the Sir Knights of California
will begin on Saturday, September 3.
Detachments of Sir Knights of the local
commanderles will be at every train
upon arrival at the depot, receive the
visitors and escort them to their hotels
or headquarters. There will be two
companies afoot and one mounted com
pany in constant attendance at the
depot for escort duty all day and night
Saturday, Sunday and Monday. Each
company will have a band and the
Templar banner while escorting visit-
Ing commanderles through the streets.
Each commandery In California will be
requested by the executive committee
to assign 10 per cent of its entire mem
bership for duty with the various com
mittees during conclave week, the du
ties to be assigned by the executive
committee.
The following Is part of the pro
gramme for conclave week, as far as
it has been outlined and approved by
the executive committee: Saturday.
September 2, will be devoted to escort
duty. Detachments of Sir Knights of
local commanderies will meet arrivals
some distance up the road, accompany
the'm to the city, where the visitors
will be met by the companies stationed
at the depot, who will escort them to
their hotels or headquarters, with ban
ners and music. On Sunday, September
4, special divine service will be held
at different churches, of a Templar
character. Local commanderles will es
cort visitors to and from the churches,
which will be designated In due time.
Receiving arrivals and escorting them
to hotels and headquarters will be con
tinued Sunday and also on Monday,
when calls will be exchanged all day
and evening. On Tuesday, September
6, the Grand Encampment of the
United States will be formally opened.
On the same day the great parade will
be held, the Knights Templars parade,
irrespective of all. other demonstrations.
It is confidently expected that from 20,
000 to 25.000 Sir Knights will be in line,
marching through the. principal streets,
which will be gorgeously draped and
decorated.
MOXEY FOR PRIZES.
I Wednesday, September 7, the com
| petitlve drills will be held at Ingleside
i during the day. Sixteen crack drill
corps of the world will compete for
prizes and honor. The committee has
appropriated $15,750 for prizes, though
the amount is most likely to be in
creased, in order to offer the greatest
Inducement to the best drill corps to
cross the continent to take part in the
competition. In the evening the Grand
Commandery of California will give a
banquet to the Grand Encampment of
the United States.
Thursday, September 8, the competi
tive drills will be resumed at Ingle
side during the day. In the evening
j the prizes will be distributed publicly
I at Mechanics' Pavilion, with a bril
liant Templar display. All the drill
corps will attend in full uniform and
go through the Templar evolutions.
The evening will conclude with a re
ception and promenade concert.
Friday, September 9, will be the great
festival, California Day, with exhibits
of the wealth of California soil and
mines, distributing of souvenirs at
headquarters, reception -Â« Mechanics'
Pavilion, Palace Hotel and all head
quarters; excursions on the bay, illumi
nation at night; reception by Grand
Commandery of California and local
commanderies.
Saturday, Sept. 10.â Taking leave of
San Francisco and goincr to the interior
to visit and behold the wonders of Cal
ifornia.
The Grand Encampment of the
United States will hold daily sessions
on< Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday^ and
Friday and elect officers for the fol
lowing term of three years.
. x THREE . GRANDSTANDS. :
It has been definitely decided to have
three grandstands from which to view
the parade, one for the grand master
and his escort, one for the Grand En
campment of the United States arid
one for the Governor of California,

GODARD SHOWS
UNUSUAL SKILL
Yesterday's Programme at
Lyric Hall Proves He Is More
Than a Merely Clever Writer
K0PTA CONCERT PLEASES
Treatment of Various Num
bers Wins Full Approval
of the Largo â¢ Audience
Probably if Mr. Kopta had thought
longer he would have put the Beetho
ven andante still further from th.e God
ard quartet than it 'was on yesterday
afternoon's - novelty concert pro
gramme. II. Godard would doubtless
have preferred it that way himself;
he is a conspicuously clever person.
Comparisons apart, yesterday after
noon's programme proves M. Godard
to be a good deal more than a merely
clever writer* We are indebted to Mr.
Kopta and his associates for introduc
tion to the work, op. 126, that opened,
and was the novelty of /the concert.
Of its four movements much the most
musical is the graceful adagio, in
which the composer, in finely melodi
ous mood, achieves also a distinguished
simplicity. . Most characteris'tlc, how
ever, is the finale, a dashing and pic
turesque movement, with the fault of
its school of an almost impertinent
cleverness, yet with an abandon and
cocksureness that carried it hand
somely. To this number the Kopta
quartet gave a quick and spirited
treatment that brought out its best. It
should be said also that . M. Godard
had every reason to be grateful for the
playing of the adagio. The third
movement, a minuetto, was encored. If
one were in cynical mood one would
say "obviously," as it is the worst.
But M. Godard Bins here only in being
too gallically gay for the form. The
opening allegro, again, is a most pleas-
Ing movement, classical in feeling, well
made and well played.
As before said the Beethoven andante
con variazione (op. 18, No. 5), followed.
It was played lovingly by the quar
tet, at times also with the 'almost Im
possible fineness it demands. Yet here
the youth of the Kopta quartet was
most In evidence, the want of that ut
ter singleness of feeling that 13 the es
sence of ensemble playing, the result
only of long association. Yet again
there is evidence of the existence of
this instinct to an unusual degree in
the Kopta quartet. Most valuable In
this regard, too, Is Mrs. Oscar Mans
feldt's work at the piano. Both by tem
perament and education Mrs. Mans
feldt has shown herself admirably
fitted for ensemble work. Her rhythmic
and dynamic sympathy Is almost uner
ring, and she has, too, exceptional tonal
and technical qualifications. Yester
day's piano number was the Schumann
piano quintet, op. 44, with its loveliest
of slow movements. This was given
with exquisite sympathy by the play
ers. They were less successful â tech
nically â In the exacting scherzo, but
gave the finale with convincing spirit
and freedom.
A pleasant adjunct of the programme
was Mrs. Lillie Birmingham's group of
songs,' that included two by Albert El
kus, the young Californlan composer.
Mrs. Birmingham gave sympathetic
and spirited interpretations of the El
kus songs, "Haroun al Raschld" and
"Ode to Spring," that show both ample
imagination (hardly yet in harness)
and technical resource. Mr. Elkus was
at the piano, and accompanied in
graceful fashion. The songs were re
ceived in distinctly friendly manner by
the audience. Mrs. Birmingham's other
songs *were "Kennst du das Land"
(Liszt) and the Schubert "Gehelmes"â
charmingly sung.
The next concert is dated for Sunday
afternoon, March 13, Lyric Hall, 'aa
usual, and Richard Strauss' piano quar
tet op. 13, for novelty.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 21.â The Post
office Department has begun a crusade
against .'the -printing of objectionable
advertisements and stories in news
papers and periodicals throughout the
country. The action is based on.Sec
tion 3S93 of the Revised Statutes, which
imposes a fine of not exceeding $5000
or Imprisonment for not over five years,
or both, for any person depositing in
the malls or aiding in circulating
through the mails, any obscene print,
pamphlet, etc. It is proposed to amend
this law to include vulgar advertise
ments and other printed matter. Un
der the new policy a number of papers
containing questionable matters have
been thrown out of the malls under
the telegraphic orders to the postmast
ers, and ( a campaign will be waged
against objectionable medical adver
tisements which are being widely pub

YOUNG CORBETTS GAME
Champion Invites Weber and Fields
Troupe to Witness Contest Between
Bulldoc and Badger.
When Young Corbett attempted to
show the fair ones of the Weber and
Fields troupe a few pointers on the real
thing in burlesque, he managed to get
his training quarters "pinched," and
the affair looked for a while as If it
might develop into a tragedy of the
heavy order.
Corbett invited several of the mem
bers of the troupe to visit his training
quarters at midnight Saturday, with
the understanding that war would be
waged between an untamed badger and
a ferocious bulldog. Incidentally some
one tipped the whole thing off to thÂ»
police.
At last, when the time was ripe, and
everything in readiness for the fray,
the police circled down from the sand
dunes and, with a mad war whoop,
charged the quarters of the champion.
The situation, for a moment, was
somewhat on the Waterloo type, but
when It was discovered that there was
no badger within miles of the camp arid
that Corbett was Just having a little
Joke on the dear girls, the police took
to the tall pines.

Gold Dredging.
BY MALCOLM UcDOUELL,
(Author ""Shop Talk " en Wonflers of tfce
Craft.")
(Copyright. 1904. by Jcseph B. Bov,leÂ«,) i
Russia is negotiating with. American
makers of hydraulic machinery for
sixty gold dredges. The Czar's repre
sentative has been in this country for
feme time examining, investigating
ar.d testing the newest and decidedly
the most r.ovel method used for rob
bing the earth of the yellow metal â
gold dredging. Apparently he is thor
oughly satisfied with this unromantic
development for placer mining, for he
wants sixty of these floating geld ex
tracting machines which, according to
experts, v.-Jl becc-me the principal
agents for supplying the world with
fc-o'.d.
Gold dredging is one o-f the new in
custrics. About ten or twelve years
Ego it was done in a small way in New
Zealand and Australia, and soon after
it appeared in Oroville, Cal. To-d.'iy
they are using dredges â ar.d the same
kind of an outfit could be employed to
â¢excavate a canal on cut . a drainage
ditch â in the orange groves of Cali
fornia and operating them by elec
tricity generated by water power many
miles distant. In Colorado the endless
chain of steel buckets is lifting the
gold-bearing material out of : its bed
â within sight of high bars and gulche?,
where a few years ago the cradle and
pans of the old-time placer miners,
those heroes cf Bret Harte and Mark
Twain, caught the grains and nuggets
for xrtiich men risked their lives and
It's all different now. Placer mining
â it used to be called the "poor man's
Â«h'ance" â is done on a wholesale basis.
Fkilled mechanics, with improved ma
chinery, go down to bed rock or hard
pan, forty-five feet sometimes, after the
gravel and sand, which carries the
gold, and do it much after the fashion
of other mechanic?, who with similar
machinery deepen river channels or
cut through sandbars in harbors. This
new. Industry has developed a new
breed of mining: engineers. It Is -a com
posite of a hydraulic engineer, gold
prospector, placer miner, topograph
ical engineer and boat builder. One
such is W. W. Dyar, general manager
of the American Gold Dredging Com
pany..' operating near Breckenridge,
" Said he: "Gold dredging is Just be
ginning. It has taken us some years
t< % develOD the .machinery we now em
ploy. There seems to be no doubt that
this method of gold mining will be
come one of the great industries, ft
car be said, in a general way. that
wherever there is a large deposit of
gravel ar.d clay carrying free goldâ
in short, wherever there are placer
mines â gold can be dredged. In most
placer mining districts there are
gulches and slopes having , sufficient
grade to mine by 'ground sluicing tr
ordinary "hydraulieking.*
"Ground sluicing is simply running
water over the ground, picking the
material and shoveling it into small
sluice boxes, leaving enough grade to
run the water off. In ordinary hy
hvciau licking water is brought to the
working in pipes under pressure and
jetting from nozzles called 'giants'
â¢..ashes dov.n the go!d-b<?aiing :na-,
torial. These were the -two methods of
placer miring up {o the time dredg
ing made its appearance. The neces
sity tttr mine rirpric^s s.tpw nut of
this condition: the high bars and
gulches were worked by ground sluic
l-.Z and hydraulieking because there
was enciugh srade to carry tho wattr
and tailings down hil! â away irotr. ihe
work. Â«But down below these high bars
and jfUif-hes were larger.* valleys con
taining gold-bearing gravel beds In
v.hich there was not enough srade to
carry off the tailings. These natter
gravel beds are very extensive, and
generally richer in gold. In order to
â¢sluice' this material it was necessary
dig it and then lift it to a height
which would give the requisite grade
for pronorly working the material. The
dredge does this. It is a self-contain-a
machine which scoor>3 out and li/ts up
the material, screens out' the large
bowlders and coarse rocks and then
sluices the material with the water
which it raises with its own pumps."
The dredge consists of a ecow or pon
toon from 100 to 140 feet long and about
forty feet wide. Its principal feature
Is the endless chain 'of- steel buckets
.which works upon the upper body of tha
â b<iat and which can be raised or low
ered at the forward or digging end by
means of steel cables. The steel buck
e{s â according to the size of the dredge

cubic feet. . â¢ ;
The po.wer for oneraing the chain of
buckets is applied at the upper end of

the. forward or cutting end of the lad
der is another tumbler which has large
flanges on its sides so that the buck-
ets cannot slip off.
The scooped up, dripping wet mate
rial falls through the hopper on to
screens. On some dredges these screens
are revolving cylinders; on others they
are flat Bcreens which are continuously
shaking so as to facilitate the screen
ing process. In both cases, â¢ however,

not pass through the 'perforations In

the dredge pond at the sides of the
boat or Is carried by a "stacker"â a
form of conveyer â to the land, where
it is stacked In ridges.
The screened material In which is

cure the precious metal, at the same
time permitting the "tailings" to run
down the sluice way and back into the
pond or on to the land. The tailings

cut out a new pond bed 'in front. As
the same water is used over and over
again it is "onlv neces'sary to provide a
fresh eofTply sufficient to make up for
seepage, evaporation and boiler use.

'Copyright. 1904, by Joseph B. Bowlee.)
The well furnished kitchen and pan
try! Probably there is not a'house
keeper in the country who has not her
ideal of what she would like these to
be. What this ideal i3 depends upon
the housekeeper and her surroundings.
The -only- point on. which one can be
tolerably sure is that she desires some
thing different from what she has.
That is human nature. In the words
of an observing old woman, "Folks is
always wantin' to have what they
hain't got and to be where they ain't."
So the country housekeeper feels
that she would exchange her broad,
roomy kitchen, where it is a journey
from the stove to the sink and from
the pantry to the mixing table, for/ a
compact little city kitchen, with all the
conveniences she knows these to pos-
ThÂ«? dwellers in flats meanwhile, al
though acknowledging the convenience
of being able -to stand in the middle
of the room and reach anything on'the
walls, on the range or in the pantry
from that one position, frets at her
damped quarters, and thinks if she
cuuld only have one of the kitchens
presided over by out-of-town friends
she would gladly resign some of the
advantages of her city tents.
Most housekeepers are more or less
dissatisfied with their kitchen walls.
They know that the whitewashed or
calcimlned walls are undesirable and
are yet doubtful how to change them.
The whitewash or calcimine blackens
and stains with smoke and the fumes
of cookery and cannot be cleansed ex
cept by removal. The housekeeper who
can afford it has her kitchen wall
painted and then Is able to wash this
off when it is spotted or darkened.
But, even soap and water fail to have
effect upon the paint after a while, and
the. old coat must be mended by a new
Â« ne. Jf this is put on year after year
over the old layer the 1. >w is likely -to
blister and crack and the wall to pre
sent an unpleasant, warty appearance.
Rather more expensive, but more en
during, is an oilcloth covering. For
this the ordinary table oilcloth, plain
or marbled, is used, and it is applied as
burlap or heavy paper might beâ with
paste. At the top it is finished off
with an ordinary wooden molding. This
oilcloth does not discolqr so rapidly as
does paint and may be kept clean for. a
long time by washing or scrubbing.
The ceiling in such a room may be
painted, although here, too, the oilcloth
might be used. But it seems unneces
sary expense. Those who have used
oilcloth claim that it wears longer and
looks better than half a dozen succes-
sive coats of paint.
The kitchen floor is also something
of a problem. Some covering it must
have that can be washed. The rag
carpet, which in our childish days
was the retaliation floor covering of
the kitchen, does not appeal to this
generation. They want something
more sanitary. Bare boards, plain or
painted,- are excellent if needed help
is at hand to keep them clean. But
spots show on these boards and they
can be made really clean only by
scrubbing. Ho oil cloth or linoleum
seems better. The latter costs, more
and wears longer. If it can have a
couple of good coats of varnish after
it is laid its wearing pdwers arc said
to bo much Increased.
Wb>n it comes to the furniture of
the kitchen, much depends upon the
space to bo filled. The owner of one
of the large kitchens of which we
have sooken would' not think she
could do her work without* two or
thrro tables on which to prepare her
food or wash her dishes.
The necessity for close packing has
taught many things to the dweller in
limited space. One clever woman has
devised a "double decker" table. A
shelf has been fitted to her table un
derneath and here she keeps 'bowls,
chopping trays and the like that she
ne?ds most often. It saves her steps
If shÂ« can reach under the table for
what she needs instead of crossing the
kitchen to set It. Another house
keeper, has put her shelf above the
table instead of below It Still another,
to whom economy was an important
consideration, made her kitchen table
of a good-sized dry. ; goods box* set on
end. Across the middle of the inside
she,rplaced a. shelf. The top of the
table had a sheet of zinc nailed upon
It am* the inside of the rough box was
lined with heavy brown paper, neatly
pasted on.
There are few women who have
lived long in narrow quarters without
learning the advantages of rows of
nails or hooks/ To hang up as much
as possible 'n order to economize
shelf space for things that cannot be
hungup, is the principle that regu
lates them. Jelly molds and Bets of
gem panB or muffin tins, dish pans,
bread boards and chopping bowls are
hung up, "as well as mixing spoons,
toasting forks, egg beaters, ladles,
skimmers and â  cake turners. Some
women go further 1 than this, and have
a narrow wooden cleat along: the "wall,
with nails driven into it 'to space it,'
arid between ; this 'strjp and" the wall
thrust the knives for .pur
posesâ the carving knife, the .; bread
knives, * the < small meat ; and vegetable
knives. m9BI '. * -M'- 'â '" ~.-

TRADE OUTLOOK UNCERTAIN.
THE business outlook has* become uncertain during
the past week and it is impossible to forecast fu
ture trade* conditions with any accuracy. This un
satisfactory state of affairs is due' wholly to the "compli
cations in Europe and Asia. It is easy enough to see
that if a general war breaks out, among the great Euro
pean and Asiatic nations and this country keeps out of
the hostilities there will be an enormous call upon us for
all sorts of army and navy supplies, which will produce
abnormal business activity a%d : high prices throughout
the country; but if, unfortunately, the United States
should be drawn into the conflict there is no knowing
what may happen in way. Everybody sees
this, for the handwriting on the wall is plain enough a3
far as it goes, but the impossibility of knowing just what
this country will feel itself called upon to do creates a
feeling of doubt and uncertainty that has already affected
the speculative markets and may soon affect general
trade itself.
At present, however, we are gaining rather than los
ing by the Russo-Japanese war and its concomitant dis
orders. Both countries are ordering goods from us,
especially on the Pacific Coast, and the prospects of a
strife lasting some months has led to sharp advances in
the cereals, but the depressed condition . of the foreign
bourses, on which international securities of every kind
have been declining, has cast a damper on our own stock
market.. Money': has thus far escaped serious stringency,
but- it is slowly hardening in Europe. Speculation in
stocks and bonds has fallen to a. low ebb, both here and
abroad, as" is quite natural under the circumstances. No
body wants the bonds of a nation plunged into a devas
tating war unless the standing and power of that nation
are so high and puissant that its continued prosperous
existence after the war, no matter how it results, is prac
tically assured, and even the bonds of such nations do not
tempt investors. ' â  . â
Capital dreads war. Thus we see a general downward
tendency in the bonds of all European' nations/ During
the past week English consols, supposed to be about
as safe as any security in the world, have steadily weak
ened, while Russian and Japanese issues have declined
daily and Bulgarian bonds have been unsalable.
bourses of every financial center in Europe have felt the
strain of uncertainty and, have reported business light
and extremely sensitive to every vague rumor. Wall
street stocks have come to a standstill and the whole
arena of stock speculation, both in this country and
abroad, reflects the hesitating and dubious signs of the
times. â¢ . "
Though this country is thus far comparatively free
from any prospect of foreign entanglement there is little
doubt that if the present complications were confined
to Russia and Japan business would be much better than
it is. Our crop prospects are good, our internal demand
for merchandise and produce excellent,, our national
treasury amply supplied with gold reserves and our banks
carrying large amounts of cash. Our foreign trade, while
more or less affected one way or the other by the war, is
of large volume and the goods we export are bringing
comparatively high price.s. 1 Collections are reported good
all over the country and a general atmosphere of stabil
ity and confidence pervades all classes of trade. Still
there is no knowing at what moment Europe may break
out into a vast and disastrous conflagration, which may
produce consequences which we cannot possibly foresee,
hence our exporters and importers are proceeding with
caution, our arc watching their accounts and
the whole commercial situation is thus kept in a state ol
suspense, for which the country itself is in nowise re-
f-ponsible.
Locally the American markets are active. Under the
stimulus of possible war in the Balkans, which of course
means a partial if not utter suspension of wheat ship
ments from Russia and the Danubian countries, wheat
has started upward and is now rising rapidly under large
speculation, while reports from Chicago say that the
market, already broad, is expanding, while the Continent,
at last awake to the situation, is advancing its bids for
the grain in this country. The minor grains feel this
quickening, impulse and are going up, in sympathy.
Speculation in provisions, with the bulls predominating,
is keeping that market up in spite of the bearish feeling
among packer? and professional traders, who regard the
market with indifference and give it no support. There
arc only three important lines of trade' lagging' at the
moment â coffee, cotton and iron. The two former hav*
latc1y N becn jr. the throes of liquidation, though there lias
been a reaction in cotton during the past few days, 'and
pig iron has v.-cakened as a result of a backward demand,
increasing production and a reported accumulation of
Â«>tock. The wool and hide markets are reported steady
and in good condition, for sellers, while dry goods have
become more active in sympathy with cotton, with buy
ers briskly replenishing assortments and paying 'full
prices without hesitation. â¢ The 'general distributive trade
of the country, while good,, is backward, owing largely
to inclement weather throughout the East and West
which imparts an unfavorable aspect to spring trade.
There was a sharp drop in the bank clearings last
week, the decrease from last year being 24 per cent, with
all but three or four of the largest cities showing marked
losses, ranging from 2 per cent at San Francisco to 32.7
per cent at New York, the pronounced loss at the coun
try's metropolis being due prpbably to the stagnation fii
Wall street. The clearings themselves, fell below the
$2,000,000,000 mark* being $1,734,205.000, 'the smallest vol
ume for some time. The failures for the week were 287,
against 247 last' year, and included some insurance com-
panies thrown into insolvency by the Baltimore fire.
Here in California we are enjoying a rise in "the; prod
ucts of our soil, due to depleted supplies of cereals and
the demands of Russia and Japan upon our granaries.
From the. selfish standpoint of dollars and cei^s we are
profiting by' the Oriental war, which is" putting a ! good
deal of foreign money into our pockets. The recent
rains and the war almost assure the California, farmer
another fine year and the realization of this, imparts a
feeling of confidence to the whole State. We are find
ing immediate 'markets for everything we produce and
at prices which keep us well supplied with funds. Hence
the outlook for 1904 in California is decidedly bright!;' -1
A TEXTBOOK FOR NEW VOTERS^
THE 'American Protective Tariff .League has
sounded the first gun of the coming' Presidential
. campaign by circulating throughout the country
the speech upon protective tariff delivered before the
House by Representative James T. McCleary of Minne
sota. As the caption of the* pamphlet indicates,; "this val
uable study of the tariff question is designed to serve as
a textbook forfirst voters, by the usc.of Avhich , they may
be enabled to gather, the essential facts^6f..pro'tectioniVm
out of all the nebulous haze of theories and fancies in
which their newly enfranchised political discretion is
Not one new voter out of five hundred, be he college
bred or otherwise, has any clear conception of the tariff
question, its history and its present day aspects. When
the great minds of Congress have gone astray upon this
very subject times innumerable since first a Congress
became the established legislative branch of the Gov
ernment, it is not to be wondered at that not only young
citizens but thousands of voters, seasoned by many cam
paigns,'have only the most rudimentary, and at times
the most distorted conception of what protective tariff
is and wherein its superiority over the free trade system'
can be made manifest by actual statistical demonstra
tion. Yet it is the tariff .'question which is the v. great
underlying factor of American political life to-day, come
what other questions of the hour there may. The money'
in our treasury, the position of our markets in the great
world mart, the prosperity of our merchants, manufac
turers and agriculturists at homeâ these things are to
be affected for good or ill by the intelligence of the
voters upon the tariff issue.
It behooves every young voter, therefore, and. every
old one whose knowledge of the points at issue in the
great question of prosperity is fragmentary or biased by
prejudice, to write to the New York headquarters of the
American Protective Tariff League and procure for his
instruction a copy of this clear and succinct statement of r
the case 1 for protective duties. After reading it he will
have at least to do a like amount of reading on the op
posite side to be convinced against the present system of
national financial strength; and that will make him what
he should beâ an intelligent voter.
California politicians are making active preparations
for the part they are to play in the approaching national
campaign. Reputations will go up and down now in
the scale of bias and. partisanship, and the great Ameri
can voter will take to the tall timber to guard against
the fire of abuse, bombast, buncombe and blatant oratory
with which we hoist our favorites into public view.
THE YELLOW BUGABOO.
THE joining of the struggle in the East seems to
have thrown over England and all of the other Eu
ropean powers a most disquieting pall of nameless
fear and haunting uneasiness. - Not many days ago a
London paper devoted three columns of its space, to an
elaborate plan for the invasion of England by Germany,
adding parenthetically that no harm was meant to Ger
many, but that the working 'out of such milita'ry puzzles
is a useful pastime, which may be turned to service at the
most unexpected moment. Now there is a book upon
the Eastern question which by its dismal prophecies of
untold woe in store for Europe has succeeded in rousing
the nervous ones in Great Britain to such a pitch of ex
citement that they are afraid to turn around and look
under their chairs.
This- "Asia.and Europe;" by Meredith Townsend, is
the reiteration of the old bogy of a "yellow whirlwind,"
but in this instance there is a touch of brown to. the
cyclone, ,for the author would have it that all India will
unite with China and Japan in the near future to form an
invincible' Asiatic alliance, whose cohorts, like a second
Tamerlane's, will sweep the white race from Asia and
turn the tide far back into the heart of Europe.
Asia, many times invaded, has never been conquered;
on the contrary, the author feels that the Far East move
ments -of the last few years which have culminated in
the present war have merely precipitated the crystalliza
tion in this seething hell pot and that the whole white
race may soon expect the outburst which is to' sound
their knell. "India will fly to pieces," says Townsend;
"the ancient hostilities of race and creed and history,
none of which have we had time to extinguish, will re
vive at once. Within five years of our departure we
shall recognize that the greatest experiment ever made
by Europe in Asia was but an experiment after, all. Asia,
which sflrtived the Greek and the Roman and the Cru
sader, will survive also the Teuton and the Slav."
The good people of England who follow the lead of
the London Daily Mail in seeing in Meredith Town
send's book a weird prophecy more portentous than that
or any witch should pause to take accounting of the facts
of history before allowing such an auld wives' talc as
that to startle them into nervous tremors. They should
remember first and above all else that no nation has
been able to become all-conquering until it has reached
the sujrmintion ofAhc civilization of the times. Japan
may be called a nation of comparatively high " civiliza
tion,' but it is inconceivable that even with her leader- j
ship groping China or halting India could ever become a
menace to the European powers so long as they continue
in anything like their present condition. Even granted
that all of the Oriental countries were enabled # to reach!
a high state of national culture and civic life, it is dim
cult to imagine a force which could bring together
Buddhist and Taoist, Mohammedan and Christian of a
dozen different bloods, to act as a unit against Europe.
The present war between Japan and Russia will prob
ably prove to be the. greatest contest in point of interests
involved which has been waged in the East- in mod
ern times. Far from deciding whether or not the West
shall be master of the East, the present conflict must de
termine whether chief dominion in the East shall lie
with a typical eastern nation or with a partially civilized
eastern race come back to the home oT its ancestors. This
is no supreme fight between the Orient and the Occi
dent, upon the result of which hinges the future of
Europe.
To those of us that care to follow the trend of passing
events with that fidelity which involves correct informa
tion Russian names have been a delusion, a snare and a
thorn in the, flesh. In the official St. Petersburg account
of the attack on Port Arthur one of the captains rendered
distinguished service. He was Kusmenkaravayeff. How
can a fellovy with a name like that hope to have it echo
down the corridors of time, much fess of fame?
The Pacific Commercial Museum has undertaken th
commendable:task of informing us of the character,
needs, demands and prospects of countries bordering on
the/ Pacific, Oceaii. When Russia and Japan have suf
ficiently paid their obligation to the splendid unreason of
war and havVset themselves back years .in the march of
civilization they will buy in our marts. We should be
prepared to sell them what they need.
;. In recent inquiries that have b*een brought -into being
by the nest of corruption which was built in the postal
service the fact developed that United" States Senator
Dietrich is a compromise representative of Nebraska in
thVuppef house at Washington.- Since then the status
of the distinguished Senator has been more properly in
the past tense. '
TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
The ~Artful Skipper.
The waters in the vicinity Â«f the Far
allones were blanketed in fog, and the
energy of the sturdy tug. outside on a
"seeking" expedition, seemed a waste
of time. Suddenly from far to seaward
came the sound of a ship's fog bell.
"A limejuicer out there," said the
tugboat skipper, "fm going to get that
lemon-pelter, and he's going to pay a
stiff price for the tow. Go forward, you.
and heave the lead."
"Why, we're out at sea. Plenty water
here, sir. Don't believe I can set bot
tom at all," demurred the deckhand.
"Do a3 I tell you. Heave the lead.
and keep on heaving until I say quit."
The captain climbed into the pilot
house, jrzng for slow speed ahead and
taking the wheel steered a cautious
course toward the sound of the sailing
vessel's regularly ringing bell.
. The British ship Cockney loomed up
ahead. Her commander was pacing the
poop, at frequent intervals peering anx
iously into the haze. His face lightened
when he saw the tug, but developed a
look of serious interest as he noticed
the busy -leadsman and heard after
each cast:
"Twenty-five fathom and no bot-
tom.".
Not a'word said the towboat skipper.
His attention was engrossed apparently
with the leadsman's chant. He would
sjiiff the air suspiciously and make fre
quent visits to the pilot-house, where
he made ostentatious examination of
his chart.
"Within a few minutes a sailor was
heaving the lead from the Cockney's
bows. In duet the leadsmen chanted:
"Twenty-five fathom and no bot
tom."
The towboat skipper spoke:
"Fraid I can't do much for you, cap-
tain. Better get your boats ready."
"Boats!" bellowed the British tar.
"Why, man alive, there's plenty water
here and we must be miles from the
Farallones."
"Where do you think you are. cap?"
asked the towboat 3kipper in a sad
tone.
The Cockney's commander gave his
position, which was substantially cor
rect and safe as any part of the ocean.
The tug boat man shook his head.
"You deep-sea fellows are pretty
careless. Before you cross that poop
twice your ship may be hard and fast
in the clutch of the cruelest rock3 in
these parts. I'm pretty anxious myself
and I don't draw a third as much a3
you do. I'm willing to try to get you
clear, but won't promise too much.
Better have your boats ready."
The man's tone was convincing. Mis
takes are easily made in navigation
and the impenetrable fog shut out all
possibility of getting bearings from
buoys or landmarks.
"What will you charge to take me
in, captain ?"- asked the now alarmed
Britisher. â¢
"Ought to ask more, as I'm risking
my boat, but seeing there's not much
sea I'll do it for $4000.
The Britisher blanched. He begged.
He threatened. He cajoled. - * '
"Make up your mind quickly," was
the only response. "I can't afford to
risk my boat much longer. Hurry up."
The Cockney was towed in. Her skip
per congratulated himself on saving
his ship by the judicious expenditure
of J4000. The tug-boat captain kicked
himself.
"What a sucker I am. And him so
easy. Might have had 510.000 just as
well."
No Jox Without Pie.
"Some queer reasons are assigned by
applicants for shelter at the Alms
, house as' to why they desire to become
inmates of the institution." said Health
Officer Ragan. "This is especially true
of the old people, who come to us with
tales of woe regarding the treatment
accorded them by their married daugh
ters, from whom, they assert, they
want to escape to a more welcome re
treat.
"An old man a few days ago applied
for admission to the refuge for the
city's poor, and the ,usual questions
were put to him regarding his family
connections, and so on. He Informed us
that he lived with his daughter at- her
residence on Van Ness avenue and that
she had driven him from home. Officer
Cottle was detailed to ascertain the
truth of the old man's tale, and he pro
ceeded to the residence designated,
guided by the old man himself.
"They were met by the daughter, who
disclaimed vehemently that she had
driven her father from home. It ap
pears that he had left his midday meal
untouched when he left to go to the
Almshouse, and the dishes were shown
to Cottle to prpve that the old man
was well provided for In the way of
food. He also had the best room in the
house, as Cottle further learned.
" 'Well,* said Cottle, turning to the
old gentleman, 'you seem to be all right
here. You do not want to go ' to the
Almshouse.'
"'Yes, I do,', replied the old man.
Then shaking his fist at his daughter
he excitedly exclaimed. 'There has not
been pie In this house for the last three
months, and she knows how much I
like pie.*
" 'Well, you will not get pie at the
Almshouse, my friend,' said Cottle, and
only then did the old man decide to re
main with his daughter."
The Misanthrope.
He neither joys nor grieves.
But cavils and mistrusts;
His hopes are like the wizened leaves.
Swirled down the autumn gusts.
He looks askance at" Life,
If so be Mirth lurk near;
He has ill-humored Doubt to wife,
And Is the slave of Sneer.
He makes a mock of Love.
And all that on her wait:
Yet; howsoe'er desire may move.
He cannot rise to Hate.
Crimes of a- former birth
Must wreak on him their spell.
Else why, while yet 1 , upon this earth.
Must he abide in hell? -

'Dangerous Experiments.
Experiments on the brain of a living
subject with electric currents have been
comparatively rare, as - there has pre
vailed among physicians and physiolo
gists the idea that such a course of
experimentation was extremely danger
ous. There have recently been pub
lished, however, records of some ex
periments carried on by M. S. Leduc.
with the. object of using the electric
current to produce sleep and of study
ing: its effects on the brain generally.
In early experiments it was shown that
the brain Is the best conductor of elec
tricity In the human body, being about
3000 times more conducting than mus
cle. It "was also observed that when a
continuous current was passed through
the head from one ear to the other,
that the sensation of giddiness was pro
duced, and that objects appeared to re
volve in the same direction as the cur
rtnt flowed. However, when the elect
rodes are placed on the forehead and
neck and the current sent from back
to front, the effects are Innocuous so
long as a mild current is used, and in
some cases may be beneficial. Acc6rd
ing to M. Leduc, the most satisfactory
current' is one of 4 milliamperes at 30
volts, which ia broken or interrupted
IOC. times a second for nine-tenths- of
the period of interruption. The prst
effect noted was the disappearance of
the faculty of speech, after which fol
lowed the loss of the motor faculties.
Under ordinary conditions there la no
affection of the respiration or pulse
unless the current is Increased, and
then it may cease. The patient is said
to awaken instantaneously from the
electric sleep and to experience a feel
ing of refreshment. â Harper's Weekly.
The Call's War Service.
The Call has had occasion to feel
justly proud of its war service. Start
ing with an exclusive announcement of

The Call has consistently furnished Its
readers with a conservative and com
plete account of affairs in the Orient.
That its enterprise has been appreci
ated by the interior papers is shewn
by their. frank and hearty congratula-
tians.
The- 5fodesto Herald says: "The San
Francisco Call has been signally scoop-

news, giving the first information- of
the outbreak of hostilities and follow
ing it with the first accuunt of that
outbreakâ the successful dash of the
Japs on the Russian fleet at Port Ar
thur â by an eye witness. Good paper.

From the Palo Alto Times comes
this: "The San Francisco Call Is giv
ing excellent reports from the scene of
the war in the Orient. Its publishers
announce that they will have the serv
ice of every reliable news agency in

the noted correspondent. Oscar King
Davis, as a special representative.
Such enterprise will add to the popu-
larity of The Call."
The Jamestown Mother Lode remarks
that "The San Francisco Call, is not
only giving its readers special dis

NATIONAL HOLIDAY â A Sub
scriber, City. There is no national
holiday in the United States, not even
the Fourth of July. " Congress bus' at
various times appointed special holi
days. In the second session "of the
Fifty-third Congress it passed an act
making Labor day a public holiday in
the. District of Columbia, and It' fcaa
recognized the existence â¢ of certain
days as holidays for commercial pur
poses, but. with the exception named,
there is no general statute on the sub
ject. The proclamation of the Presi
dent designating a day of thanksgiv
ing only makes it a legal holiday In
the District of Columbia and the Ter
ritories and in those States which pro
vide by law for It.

Of the good things in this week's

a certain engaging human quality, do
not save it from unintentional absurd
ity. "The Black Cat" needs the pen
cil that is blue ar.d a careful hour with
Its incident. Al Filson as the miner
down on his luck was a little over

enjoyable. As his wife Miss Lee Errol
gave a quaint and thoroughly humor

Eddie Girard, who is weirdiy good

could give points in clear and delicate

A shift of turns gave the audience
a chance to enjoy at leisure some of
the cleverest horizontal bar work that
she Orpheum has seen for some time.
Morris and Bowen, scheduled for the
usual acrobatic moment before the bio

Fathers and mothers who wish to
learn to what state of mental develop

Fee "Human Hearts" at the California
this week. There is a little baby
playing there, "Little Myrtle Barker"
by name, who is the apotheosis of all
childish acting that has ever appeared
on this or other shores. She numbers
less than five years to her credit in this
mundane sphere, but one cannot help
remembering on seeing her the lines
of Shelly, "We look before and after,
and pine for what is not." She is of
the substance that Bernhardts and
Siddonses are made of. In size she
reaches the shoetops of the brawny
Etrutters of the play: in effect she Is
a giant among pigmies.
AH the damp handkerchiefs that the
women wrung out silently under the
seats were due to the real touch of hu
man nature that this real human child
added to the piece. There is a brawny
blacksmith, unjustly sentenced to
prison; an unscrupulous woman, a
blind mother, a villain with store-made
clothes and a tramp who really should
be in better company. Thelb played

EXHIBITS FROM ETHIOPIA
3Ionarch Proposes to Display
Products at St. Louis Exposi
tion and Promises Good Will
WASHINGTON. Feb. 21.â How the
United States has come Into trade re
lations with a new region containing
10,000.000 of people is briefly told in
the report to Mr. Loomis, the Assistant
Secretary of State, of Robert P. Skin
ner, the American Consul General at
Marseilles. France, on his highly suc
cessful mission to Abyssinia last No
vember for the purpose of negotiating
with King Menelik a trade treaty and
to collect information about the com
mercial resources of that country.
As a result of this mission Mr. Skin
ner negotiated a treaty which, if ac
ceptable, will secure for the United
States the most favored nation priv
ileges in Ethiopia and will guarantee
to American citizens and merchandise
immunity from discrimination in rates
on all public roads and lines of com-
munication.
In addition Mr. Skinner prevailed
upon King Menelik to accept an invi
tation for his country to participate
in the St. Louis exposition and pre
liminary arrangements for a compre
hensive exhibit at St. Louis have been
made. The King will send during the
coming summer a commission of dis
tinguished and representative men
who will have charge of the exhibit.
Mr. Skinner, after narrating these
facts, says:
"Acting on the part of the Interior
Department I have secured a collec
tion of the seeds of the more impor
tant crops peculiar to Ethiopia, a
number of which may be found avail
able in the exploitation of the uncul
tivated western lands of the United
States, now being made available by
the extension of our irrigation system.
ABYSSINIA'S RESOURCES.
I "I have also in hand material for a
report on the agricultural resources of
Abyssinia. The Agricultural Depart
ment particularly desired to secure a
collection of wild coffee seeds for ex
perimental purposes. These could not
be obtained during my visit, but have
been ordered and ultimately will be
forwarded. Such a collection could be
found only in Kaffa, a remote province,
access to which Involves a long and ex
pensive journey. The experts of the
Agricultural Department have a theory
that the degeneration of the modern
coffee p'ant is due to the fact that cof
fee culture has been based on seed orig
inally imported from Arabia, and that
by getting back to the wild coffee
plant, the habitat of which is in the
province of Kaffa, a new variety may
be created, the value of which will be
I incalculable.
"My endeavor to secure a pair of
zebras for cross-breeding purposes was
also in vain. These animals are exceed
ingly rare and difficult to capture alive.
I have left instructions, however. In re
gard to this matter, and trust to be
able to supply two of these animals
! some time in the future.
J "The presence of the mission in Eth
1 iopia has had the effect of turning her
â¢ attention toward the United States as
I a probable source of supply for many
manufactured articles for which an ex
panding market is certain to re
sult upon the completion of the rail
way, and as a probable consuming
market for such product as may be
available for export."
RECEPTION* BY MEXELIK. â 
Mr. Skinner records In detail his ex
pedition to Abyssinia from the time he
left New York on October 8 up to the
day on which he set sail, January 15.
He calls attention to the prompt facil
ities which the French Government of
fered for the progress of the expedi
tion across French territory. Mr. Skin
ner gives this picturesque description
of his reception by the Emperor:
"Two hours after camping, accom
panied by M. Chefnux (Counsellor of
State) the mission set out for the
Aderach, or seat of government, ac
companied by an Ethiopian escort of
2000 men under command of a dis
tinguished general. Although our re
ception at Harrar had not been devoid
of military pomp, we were astonished
and our appreciation of the picturesque
gratified by this glimpse of Ethiopian
troops upon a ceremonial occasion. Ar
rayed in gorgeous silks and satins, with
lion and leopard skin mantles, gold and
silver plated buckles, carrying lances
from which floated the national colors,
mounted upon spirited horses, they gal
loped into formation, the order of which
was an apparent disorder, a scene as
indescribable as it was memorable. A
band cf shaw-players heralded our
coming with weird music, which has
not been changed since the fall of Jeri
cho.
"At the palace of Guehl, our escort
fell back and the mission, always ac
companied by the marines and blue
jackets, proceeded through a series of
courtyards and after receiving a salute
from a company of 200 native artillery
men under the command of an Euro
pean officer and a further salute of
twenty-one guns in honor of the United
States, we entered the Aderach. an
audience chamber of cathedral-like
proportions. The Emperor sat upon
his throne, surrounded by his more Im
portant advisers, representing the ad
ministrative department, the Judiciary,
the army and the church. Back of the
two rows of pillars supporting the roof
were massed several thousand of the
leading people of the addisababa, all
In-Holiday regalia. Our reception was
cordial but formal. ' â¢
NINE DAYS* CONFERENCE.
For nine days Mr. Skinner was In
conference with the Emperor and his
chiefs of staff. At the farewell audi
ence the Emperor received the entire
expedition and bestowed decorations
upon all the officers of the expedition,
and presented medals to the marines.
Ta Mr. Skinner the Emperor gave two
young lions and a pair of elephant
tusks, together with a personal letter
of friendship and good will addressed
to the President, which he gave as tes
timonials of his friendship and good
will to the United States. Of the na
tion's resources Mr. Skinner said:
"The empire holds out no attractions

WASHINGTON, Feb. 21. â Final
steps will be taken this week toward
beginning the construction of the isth
mian canal by the United States Gov
ernment. The treaty will be ratified
by the Senate on Tuesday and the
commission announced by the Presi
dent on Wednesday.
According to the latest poll, made
yesterday and to-day, .there will be
seventeen Democratic Votes against
the treaty. These are: Senators Bailey,.
Carmack, Daniel, Morgan, Blackburn,
Teller, Gorman, Newlands, Culberson,
Bates, Martin, Pettus, Overman, Du
bois, Tillman, Patterson and Mc-
Laurin.
The Democratic Senators who will
vote for the treaty are: Simmons, Ba
con, Mallory. Money, Stone, Berry,
McEnerny, Latimer, Clay, Taliaferro,
McCreary, Cockrell, Clarke (Arkan
sas), Foster and Gibson.
According to present indications and
the belief of all the majority leaders
there will be no. Republican vote
against the treaty.
Only three members of the .Canal
Commission to be announced on
Wednesday are known to a certainty,
except to the President and his ad
visers. These are Rear. Admiral John
G. Walker, General George W. Davis
and Colonel Frank G. Hecker of* De
troit. Colonel Hecker's appointment
was urged by the late Senator Hanna
and before his death President Roose
velt promised Mr. Hanna that he
would appoint him.
While the ratification of the treaty
is the last important step toward the
building of the canal, other legislation
will be pressed before the present ses

The Headsman's Defense.
Deibler Jr.. who has succeeded his
father as public executioner of France,
has sent, through a process server, a
letter to a Journal by which he con
siders that he has been libeled. The
newspaper had attacked the principle
of capital punishment in general, and
the present guillotine operator in par
ticular. The remarks in Deibler's let
ter are quite worth quoting. He ob
serves that the journal has fallen into
the common mistake of coupling the
functionary with the function. If the
writer had taken the trouble to make
inquiries he would haver found out
that, in this Instance, the man and the
institution are to be considered apart
As a matter of fact, Diebler himself,
strongly disapproves of capital pun
ishment. "But," he adds, with a- yet
more sardonic humor, "one must
live." â London Daily Telegraph.
"Have you heard the latest? Brown's
wife has run. off with his chauffeur."
"Mercy, what a pity! He was such a
good chauffeur! â¢ Brown will never be
able to replace him."â Smart Set.
to the commercial adventurer with
limited means. Too many of Euro
peans now in the field are of that class
and the Emperor, with just reason, is
weary of the constant clamor for con
cessions from all sorts and conditions
of persons whose only object is to find
a purchaser at an exorbitant figure. On
the other hand, enterprises planned
with skill and backed with sufficient
capital may be undertaken and carried
out with every assurance that property
interests will be respected by the Gov
ernment and that promoters of such
enterprises will be welcomed with a
catholic spirit."

GOVERNOR PARDEE DEALS WITH IMPORTANT TOPIC OF IRRIGATION.
ARTHUR R. BRIGGS DEFINES DUTY OF THE STATE BOARD OF TRADE
IRISH PEOPLE
TO HAVE HALL
Delegates From Various Gaelic
Societies Vote on Disposition
of St. Patrick's Day Funds
A BOUSING MEETING HELD
Citizens From Emerald Isle
.Want to Have a Building- That
Will Be Monument to Them
The Irish population of San Fran
cisco is to have a hall of its own in
â which the various Gaelic societies can
hold their meetings and entertainments.
The executive committee of the an
nual convention of Irish societies for
the formulation of plans for the cele
bration of St. Patrick's day met yes
terday afternoon at the hall of the
Knights of the Red Branch at 1133
Misskm street.
After a lengthy discussion by the
various members present it was voted
that the funds derived from the athletic
and literary exercises to be held on
St. Patrick's day be used in the pur
chase of a eite and the erection of a
haU for the Irish people of San Fran
cisco. The money is to be turned over
to the Celtic Hall Association, which
now has the sum of $11,000. With the
present fund and the one which the
Irish people expect to raise by their
St. Patrick's day celebration, it Is be
lieved that a fine site can be purchased
and a hall be erected that would be
an everlasting monument to the Irish
citizens of this citv.
Delegates representing all of the
Irish societies in the city were present
and a rousing meeting was held. Among
those who were active in the dlscus
eion as to the disposition to be made
of th* funds derived from the St.
Patrick's day celebration were John
Mulhern, T. P. O'Dowd, Peter Tariony,
James B. Heggerty, J. B. Moriarlty,
John P. McQuire. J. J. Smith. William
Mulvin, J. P. KeUeL.r and J. O'Con
nor.
Meetings for the promulgation of
plans for St. Patrick's day exercises
â were begun a week ago Sunday and
will be held every Sunday afternoon
until the 17th of March. At the meet
ing yesterday some of the delegates
advocated the using of the money they
expected to get In the reconstruction
of the Knights of the Red Branch Hall
and make that an Irish hall. The ma
jority of the delegates, however, fa
vored the purchase of a new site and
the erection of a brand new building.
The plans so far for the observing
of the Irish celebration day have not
been completed, but It is understood
that they will not vary materially
from the ones of previous years.

J. II. Johnson Found Dead fn Bed in
His Room With Gas Turned
On lull.
J. II. Johnson, a painter, was found
dead in his room at 2S7 Natoma street
yesterday morning. The room was full
of gas, which was escaping from the
Jet. It was turned on full, the door
was locked and both windows were
closed. One of the other roomers, John
Loesch, had to gain an entrance by
climbing through a window. Whether
It was a case of accidental death or sui
cide has not yet been determined. The
body was removed to the Morgue.
Johnson was a single man, 30 years
of age, and had been living for two
years in the house. Mrs. Bertha Hage
dorn, the landlady, told Detective SH
vey that Johnson had gone to his room
about 1 o'clock yesterday morning and
at 9 o'clock he was discovered dead in
bed. She said Johnson used to drink,
but not to excess. Johnson had taken
home with him a flask of whisky and
had emptied it. A device for secreting
cards up a sleeve was found 4n the
room and $35 in gold.

day morning that two men had seized
him by the throat in E. P. Peterpon's
saloon. Second and Howard ' streets.
while a third had stolen a bottle of
whisky from his pocket. McMurray
accompanied Schultz back to the sa
loon and was told by the barkeeper
that the men were fooling with Srhultz
and one of them bought another bottle
of whisky and offered it to Schultz,
who refused to take it. Schultz said
there was no fooling, and that he knew
one of the men and would swear out
a warrant for his arref-t.
I Joy Parts With Money.
Ernest Michaux, a boy from Nevada,
went into a ten-cent show at 906 Kear

Twenty Million Can Find
Support in Great
California.
Only Prerequisite Needed
Is Perfect Systems
. for Water.
BY GEOKGE C. PARDEE,
GOVERXOU Ol$ CALIFORNIA.
The irrigation of ancient Egypt
should be a most interesting and im
portant question to every loyal Call
fornian. It has come to be understood
here in California that, while we now
nave a population of less than a mil
lion and three-Quarters, we might, if
we could only properly cultivate our
25,000,000 acres of arable land, sup
port in comfort, yes, in luxury and af
fluence, easily 20,000,000 of happy and
contented people.
We know that in the Valley of the
Po, in ItaJy, there live, in Italian com
fort, 8,000,000 of people on 3,000,000 acres
of land. They take the water from
the River Po and put it on their lands
at such times and in such quantities
as their crops demand. Nature cannot
be depended on to give us rains in
such quantity and at such times as
will exactly .fulfill the needs of the
husbandmen. Sometimes Jupiter Plu
vlus pours down too much water to
plea*e us y - for the moment; at other
times he withholds his life-giving
showers. And, if we depend entirely
on his whims and fancies, too often
are we deceived by the tricky god's
fair promises and our crops do not ful
fill our expectations.
PATH TO INDEPENDENCE.
But, give the farmer his irrigating
ditch and he becomes Independent of
the god of rains. If the showers come,
well and good; if they do not come, he
laughs at nature and pours upon his
thirsty land, at Just such times and
In just such quantities, the water that
will Insure his crops and till his lands
to their full capacity.
If Egypt had, in Joseph's time, the
Irrigation svstem that she soon will
have, the seven lean years, of which
the story of Joseph's life so quaintly
speaks, would have caused no uneasi
ness to Pharoah, and it would not have
been necessary to fill the royal gran
aries with the products of the seven
fat years. And if the Valley of the
Po were deprived of its irrigating sys
tem, instead of 8,000,000 people living
on its fertile land, its population could
not be greater than one-third that
number, although the rainfall there is
greater than that which we have in
Fan Francisco.
But coming a little nearer home,
those of us who have been to Salt Lake
City and enjoyed the verdure and the
prosperity of that Mormon town, and
have contrasted It with the surround
ing barrenness of the desert, will ap
preciate how great a blessing irrigation
is. On this land, which, without the
irrigating ditch will raise nothing, are
raised fine apples, pears, plums, ber
ries, grapes and all the grains in amaz
ing Quantities. These old Mormons
were great people. Just think of choos
ing the Salt Lake Desert for an abid
ing place, when California, which they
knew all about through their scouts,
was only 700 miles away! But I'm glad
they did settle where they did, for it
gives us Californians an object lesson,
a; our verv doors, of what irrigation
will do for a people who have the en-
ergy to employ it
And here in California we have seen
with our own eyes the benefits of irri
gation. When I first knew SoutherA
California thirty-five years ago the
spots where Pasadena, Redlands and
Riverside now are were deserts, on
whose lean and dreary acres a few
head of cattle were able to pick up a
precarious living. It wrs a land of
cactus, rattlesnakes, jack rabbits and
coyotes. Out of what was then that
desert there go this year alone 30,000
cars of oranges. Several great cities
now people its former solitudes, and
Southern California has become a land
of wealth and luxurj\ What brought
it all about? "Why. nothing but the
wedding together of irrigation water
and the desert. 9
FACTS ARE TEACHERS.
Without the irrigating ditch Los An
geles rould be nothing but the village
It was before, asid Pasadena, Redlands
and Riverside could have no existence.
There would be no oranges thei"e, and
the millions of dollars that this indus
try alone brings into them would not
be theirs. To illustrate: Thirty years
ago the land v. here Riverside now is
raised nothing and was indeed a "des
ert." To-day there live, in affluence,
< n, 12,000 acres of this "desert" land,
10,000 people, with churches, schools,
libraries and banks galore. And noth
ing under heaven brought this about
but the putting on of water, through
the Irrigating ditch, at such times and
in such quantities as the intelligent
orange grower knew his trees de
manded.
Take Fresno for another example. A
quarter of a century ago the land that
produces a great part of the raisins
the United States now uses was.prac
tically a desert, worth, for sheep pas
ture in the springtime, $2 or $3 an
acre, although the average rainfall
there is about nine inches per annum.
But since the water of Kings River
has been put upon it that land is
worth J250 to $500 per acre. And, where
formerly the sheep herder* was lord of
all he surveyed, to-day, on 65,000 of
those Irrigated acres, there live, on
farms arid in the wealthy city of
Fresno, 23,000 people, whpse average
bank accounts are greater than any
other community of which I have any
knowledge.
The great valleys of the San Joaquin
and Sacramento, from Bakersfleld to
Redding, with the great rivers travers
ing them from end to end, now, T.ith
here and there a small and notable ex
ception, raise but a tithe of what
there should be raised. The towns are
small and few and far between, and
one rides sometimes for miles without
seeing even a farmhouse. Yet the 20,
000,000 acres of land lying in and Im
mediately tributary to those great
valleys is at least as fertile as that at
Riverside and Fresno. And were its
owners to put their dependence no
longer In the rains that fall from
heaven, but turn upon their acres the
water that now runs swiftly by them
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. MONDAY, FEBRUARY 22, 1904.
Transfer Canal for Nevada
Prepares to Draw
From River.
Work upon the large transfer canal
and its accessories from the Truckee
River to the Carson River reservoir
to be constructed was begun in Sep
tember, 1903, to be completed in four
teen months from date of beginning.
This canal when completed will be
about 31 miles in length and is intended
to carry all surplus floods of the
Truckee to a convenient point of dis
tribution adjacent to the large areas
of reclaimable lands in the broad
valley at the mouth of the Carson.
The obstacles to this are easily over
come in the favorable contours of the
divide between these two river systems,
the annual flow of the Truckee being
far in excess of the actual demands
at present for both Irrigation and
power purposes. Preliminary observa
tions of river flows, covering a period
of several years, have shown conclu
sively that the discharge of the
Truckee will more than meet the re
quirements of all the reclaimable
lands within both districts.
BIG RESERVOIR DAM.
The building of this particular, canal
Is to be immediately followed by the
erection of a big reservoir dam on the
Carson to receive Its flow, also distrib
uting canals from reservoir and main
line of canal. Another large canal
will connect the Truckee River system
with valuable lands near Pyramid
Lake. All, when completed, will ag
gregate from 80 to 100 miles of main
lines and as many miles more of lat
erals. The transfer canal from the
Truckee to the Carson has a capacity
of 50,000 to 60,000 miners* Inches. The
canal from Carson River to the vicin
ity of Stlllwater will have a greater
capacity at its intake, and the line
from the Truckee to Pyramid Lake
will have a capacity of perhaps 25,000
miners' inches
All unappropriated Government lands
within reach of the waters of this gen
eral system were by act! of Congress of
June 17, 1902, withdrawn from public
sale and are In the future to be held
subject to homestead entry only, and in
amounts ranging from eight acres of
first quality to perhaps 320 acres of the
poorest. This Is a detail, however, upon
which at the present time no definite
Information may be had, the Secretary
of the Interior reserving full powers as
to the final shaping of areas. The cost
of land to the homeseeker will be the
usual fees at the land office and a re
quirement of five years' actual occu
pancy of the landâ no constructive resi
dence to go.
PLACING THE EXPENSE.
After completion of the entire system
the aggregate cost of the same will be
apportioned pro rata per acre on all
lands reclaimed and for sale or sold,
and such pro rata figure will be the
to the oeenn, villages, towns and cities
would spring up like magic, and where
now but tens of thousands live millions
would have their habitations.
LEARN FROM EGYPT.
So after all the irrigation of ancient
Egypt should be a most interesting and
Important question to every loyal Cal
ifornian. For, from the land of the
Pharaohs, the land whence Moses led
the children of Israel out of bondangs
across the receding Red Sea, the land
of mystery and ancient civilization,
the land of the Sphynx and the Pyra
mids, the land of deserts land of dense
population, the land where Cleopatra
and Anthony lived and lovedâ from this
ancient land we may learn a lesson
that will, if we will but heed it, teach
us how to make our beloved California
independent of the vagaries of the
gentle rain that falls from heaven,
and make our State a more beautiful
garden, a more fruitful paradise, than
ever mortal eyes dared hope to look
upon.
As you know, middle Egypt, from
Assuan to the mouth of the Nile, some
600 miles long by 8 miles broad, con
tains but 3,000,000 acres and the 3,
000,000 people who live there former
ly depended" upon the annual over
flow of the river Nile for the fertiliza
tion of their lands. But If the river
rose thirty feet above low water mark
great damage resulted to land and
crops, while, if the river did not rise
higher than eighteen feet a drought
and an absolute failure of crops was
sure to follow and a famine like those
of Biblical times resulted.
In order to conduct, the water from
the flood- full river to its parched and
thirsty lands, in order to raise the one
crop a year- upon which it depended
for its very existence, ancient Egypt
did just what the people of Southern
California have done and what r the

cost per acre to the landholder for
water. The landholder will be given the
option of paying in full at One payment
for water or payment In ten equal an
nual payments, at the end of which
time It is expected the Government will
turn the whole system, with ownership,
over to the landholders of the district,
Its general management to be subject
to the direction of a State Water Com
missioner, whose selection is within the
approval of the director of the United
States Geological Survey.
The lands of Nevada when well served
with water will hold their own against
the world in the present production of
beef, potatoes and beet sugar. The
present time and development mark the
beginning of an era of inestimable
scope and bearing upon the future of
the State.

people of Northern California must do
and are about to do, viz: irrigate.
RESULTS ARK CERTAIN'.
Real irrigation means freedom from
dependence on the rains. It means
that the husbandman can put in his
crops, several of them in a year, and
be sure that he can get water on the
land just when his growing plants
need it. It is only with this, which is
the only real kind of irrigation, under
which live crops of alfalfa can be
grown every year, as can be done in
many parts of California; it is only
in this way that the orange grower
can be sure of a crop. Without it
there would be no Pasadena, no Riv
erside, no Fresno, no Los Angeles.
And with it the great valleys of the
San Joaquin and Sacramento, the
great California "Valley of the Nile"
will beat the whole world â bar no
part of itâ in all that goes to make
the happy living place of a dense and
prosperous population.
As I said in the beginning, the irri
gation of ancient Egypt, should be a
most interesting and. important ques
tion to every loyal Californlan.

BY ARTHUR R. BRIGGS,
MANAGER STATE BOARD OF TRADE.
A true understanding of the work of
the California State Board of Trade
and a comprehensive view of its useful
ness can be had only through some
what intimate knowledge of what the
board does. The superficial observer is
disposed to think its obligations begin
and end in the daily routine of dis
tributing information in a mechanical
way and of keeping up and caring for
the exhibits of the State's resources,
which are maintained in the exhibit
room. Even contributors to the support
of the State board, as a rule, do not
find time to famalianze themselves
with the work that is being done, but
for the most part have but the brief
mention from time. to time In the col
umns of the daily press as a basis for
their belief that good results are being
accomplished.
RELATION* TO GROWTH.
The relation of the State Board of
Trade to the growth and prosperity of
the State Is by no means expressed
through the clerical duties of receiving
and answering the vast number of let
ters that come dally, asking for infor
mation of various kinds; or in enter
taining the throng of visitors that seek
the exhibit room, "or in the interest
manifested in the books, pamphlets,
maps and newspapers always at hand
and ready for use in the reading room.
This is a necessary detail, as is also
the looking after the preparation and
mail distribution of printed matter re
lating to the State, which calls for the
exercise of Intelligent and patient in
terest on the part of those having it
In. charge. But the more important
work requires a wide knowledge of the
geography of the State and of Its re
sources; a close relation to all the va
ried interests and the ability to analyze
conditions and treat them in an intelli
gent way.
Inquiry, largely of a specific kind,
continues to increase from month to
month, and the State board rooms are
sought by Eastern visitors, who repre
sent colony projects and who must
have practical demonstration and
actual knowledge on which to base re
ports and recommendations to the peo
ple they represent. Since the beginning
of the present year much of the time
of the manager has been given to this
specific work.
VISITORS ARE ESCORTED.
In addition to ascertaining from
Eastern , representatives their require
ments, the work Is followed up by go
ing through the State with them and
by affording opportunity for a careful
study of conditions and the opportuni
ties for establishing successful colonies
in the districts visited. Among the
very Important Eastern representatives
who have been in consultation with the
State board during the present month
may be mentioned the Rev. Dr. Carl A.
Swensson of LInsborg, Kans., and the
Rev. Dr. L. G. Abrahamson of Chicago,
two - distinguished representatives of
the Swedish Lutheran church in the
Middle "West. ,Their visit to California,
which Â«was mainly due to the efforts of
the State board, is likely to result in
Important colony settlements In the San
Joaquin Valley, vhere in their opinion
after a study of the situation great op-
portunities are presented.
The Rev. J. E. Seth of Superior. Wis.,
who Is now In' the State, is making in
quiry through the Sacramento Valley
with the hope of founding a large col
ony of Swedes of the independent Luth
eran faith. The Rev. Mr. Seth is the
pastor of the Scandinavian Mission in
Superior, WIs., and will have a large
following if suitable locations and con
ditions are found.
Much attention is also given to di
recting intending settlers who are seek
ing suitable locations for mercantile and
manufacturing enterprises, and there is
at present quite an inquiry for loca
tions In the interior of the State, where
opportunity is open for establishing
banks. In fact, people seeking oppor
tunity for investments in California,
whether in land for the purpose Â«f de
veloping farms or in any branch of
business In towns or cities, always re
ceive most careful attention.
ENCOURAGES INTERIOR.
Close relations are being established
with the counties and commercial bod
ies. This is accomplished through cor
respondence and by personal visits
from a representative of the board.
"While the value of county exhibits
properly maintained in the exhibit
room can scarcely be overvalued, no
county is discriminated against by rea
son of non-afflllation. From our point
of view no county can afford to be un
represented with an exhibit, but wheth
er it is or not its literature is carefully
and freely distributed. An object lesson
is always effective and lasting, and
when supported with reliable informa
tion attractively presented in printed
form benefit is sure to follow.
The State Board Is now issuing bulle
tins regularly at short Intervals, cov
ering a wide range of subjects. These
are prepared by members of the board
and others who have expert and prac
tical knowledge of the subject treated,
and there is wide inquiry for them as
soon as they are issued.
The annual reports of the board have
come to be recognized as standard au
thority on climate, productions and de
velopment of the State. #he report for
1903 is now in preparation and will be
more comprehensive than ever before.
The board has in contemplation a
work on the State throughout, in which
all the counties will be treated Individ

naturally have the advantage. It la

OSTRICH FARM
AT SAN JOSE
Local Company Will Start a
Place for Breeding and
Birds "\Vjll Arrive at Once
SAX JOSE, Feb. 21.â San Jose is to
have an ostrich farm. A carload of
birds are now en route to this Â«:ity,
and inside of a week the industry will
be established. Colwell P. Leitch of
Phoenix, Ariz., is the promoter of the
project. The ostrich farm will be lo
cated on Alum Rock avenue, corner of
King road. A show farm and sales
room will be conducted there. The
place will be opened to the public about
March 1. Ostriches of all ages and sizes
from the young chick to the <:ocks
ready for plucking will be exhibited.
A large stock of feathers, eggs and os
trich novelties will be carried. The os
triches will arrive in San Jose to-mor-
row morning.
Besides the show farm, a breeding
farm v.ill be established some distance
from this city. There a large number
of birds will be kept and raised for
their feathers', which will be prepared
for the trade. It Is proposed to raise
enough feathers to supply the trade on
this coast in a few years. The cli
mate of Santa Clara County is well
suited for ostriches, and those interest
ed have no doubt that the birds will
do well here. A mail order business
in feathers will also be established.
Negotiations are also pending for other
birds besides those on the way here.
The business will.be conducted under
the name of the San Jose Ostrich Com-,
pany, which is naw being Incorporated.
It Is capitalized at 525,000, the entire
amount of which has been subscribed
and invested in the business. The di
rectors of the company are Colwell P.

An excerpt from a London paper
gives us a glimpse of club life in the
world's metropolis, and it is notewor
thy that philanthropy, cultural work
or serious effort figure not in their con
stitution â comfort and good fellowship
(the keynote of pleasure) â figure solely
and alone. This has been said of one:
Take the New Century Club, for example.
As one enters, uniformed lads take your cards
or hand you letters or telegrams. A broad
stairway leads to fine sleeping apartments,
bathrooms, restrooms, etc., furnished luxurl-
ously.
On the right of the entrance hall are large
dressing-rooms, with mirrors and closets and
plenty of electric curling irons. Then comes
the Oriental smoking-room, with its open fire
and big easy chairs, its tiny tabourettes hold-
Ing matches and cigarettes and Its center table
filled with late books and papers.
Out in the west of London is a residential
club, with a room for each member. It is
called the Twentieth Century Club and is al
most exclusively composed of working women.
Here are gathered writers, dramatists, artists
and those whese way in life leads into the
great commercial heart of the city. A big
gar-Jen, with shade trees and flowers, ts the
favorite place for tea on Sunday afternoons in
the summer.
This experiment of a home club was started
by three millionaires, and it has proved so
successful that the premises have been great
ly enlarged in the last year and the member
ship raised from fifty to 100. In the summer
the Twentieth Century Club has additional
quarters on the Island of Guernsey, in the
channel, near the beautiful shores of Brittany.
On Norfolk street. In the Strand, in the very
center of the old and fascinating part of Lon
don, where all the houses are filled with his
toric memories. Is the home of The Writers.
At its Thurpduy afternoon teas the rooms are
filled to overflowing with women whose names
are famous In the literature of the day and
singers and actresses of international reputa-
â¢ This club Is Koinj? to abandon its old quar
ters for more roomy ones; but it must be. with
great regret to the members, for nowhere else
will be found the atmosphere of this part of
Ixindon, hemmed in, as it is, on all Bides by
old streets, old buildings and parks that were
the haunts of Dickens, Thackeray, Goldsmith,
Dr. Johnson and other Immortals.
i In another historic quarter, not far from
the Strand, but near Drury Lane and Covcnt
Garden, is the Pharos Club. This is one of
the few mixed clubs In London. It has spa
cious drawing rooms, and once a week these
ere fUled by the members and their guests,
while some weil-known speaker talks to the
club on his hobby for an hour or two. They
aro delichtfully Informal talks, and are
usually followed by a sort of general debate.
Kllgibillty to the Pharos Club consists in beinff
"In sympathy with current thought," so one
can see that there Is not much in the way
toward becoming: a member; but the can
didate will sometimes find it rather difficult
to set the requisite number of votes. It Is
an fxclusive clrck-, many of whose members
bear titles of greater or lesser degree.
One of the latest and most attractive of
these organizations is the Woman's Army and
Navy Club, composed of the wives, mothers,
daughters and sisters of the officers of the two
eei-vlcea. The membership, of course, is not
limtied exclusively to them, but it is one of
the most. If not the most, exclusive of all the
London clubs, and to become a member ie to
achieve a social success. Its room3 are ex-
quisitely furnished.
A list of the other woman's clubs in Lon
don would be a long: one. In all of them the
members have the privilege of entertaining
their men friends and acquaintances, as well
as thoFe of their own ses, and delightful din
ners and luncheons are given in the attrac
tive dininR rooms.

CHINESE QUARREL
AXD ONE IS KILLED
Dispute Over a Card Game Leads to
.Murder in a Sacramento
Lodglng-IIouse.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 21. â This
morning about 4 o'clock Chinese
were playing a game of cards In a
lodging-house when Chu Chung, aged
about 40, charged Ah Wooey, aged 50,
with cheating. A fight followed, in
which Chu Chung stabbed Ah Wooey
in the left side with a dagger made of
a ground-off table knife. The weapon
entered the left side, severed the
spleen, reached to the spinal column
and cut an artery, and the result was
that the wounded man bled to death
within three-quarters of an hour. The
murderer is in custody. Four white
witnesses saw the difficulty. The
prisoner denies the cutting, but the
knife was found and the witnesses are
strong proofs against him.

of construction and those to be built is
$31,826,860, against ) for ! the
current year, an increase Â»of $5,901,228.
The programme is reasonable, as to the
amount of money, and is likely to be
increased, rather than to be- reduced;
but the number of fighting ships is in
adequate, and ought to be increased
with at least one more battleship. As
to colliers, which are to carry 6000, tons
of coal and are to have a trial speed of
sixteen knots, and for which $1,250,000
is asked, there is no pressing demand.
The navy has already sixteen colliers
with carrying capacities ranging from
2078 tons to 4575 tons. There are scores
of merchant steamers available for
such purposes, and it would be more
reasonable to provide for more fighting
ships, rather than to increase the aux-
iliary list
Secretary Moody calls attention to the
fact that the practice of detaching a
ship from the fleet and sending it to a
navy yard for minor repairs is waste
ful in time and money and detrimental
to efficiency. During the year ending
July 1, 1903, the percentage of time
spent by ships at navy yards undergo
ing repairs was: For the Alabama, 36;
Kearsarge, 28; Indiana, 28; Massachu
setts/ 27; Texas, 32, and Olympia, 15
per cent. These ships, attached to the
North Atlantic fleet, were supposed to
be in commission for active service,
"but once at a navy yard." the Secre
tary says, "the temptation to take ad
vantage of the opportunity to make
and continue repairs \s natural." To
this it is not amiss to add that the
officers and crew would, as a rule,
rather complete the cruise at a navy
yard than to hurry awiy and encounter
the discomforts at pea.
RETIREMENTS IN Â»?IIE NAVY.
Retirements In the navy, voluntarily
and by age limit, have been somewhat
frequent of late and promotions as a
consequence are rapid. It Is to be
noted in this connection ihat voluntary
retirements of captains and command
ers are rare, and that it Is only 'when
an officer reaches the grade of rear
admiral that phvsical ailments or do
mestic affairs impel voluntary retire
ments. It is less than a month ago
that Rear Admiral Lamberton, in
command of the South Atlantic squad
ron since January 1, 1904, retired be
cause of impaired eyesight, and now
Rear Admiral Cotton has hauled down
his Hag in the European squadron
after less than ten months' commission.
Sickness at home is the cause assigned
for his application to retire. Some
years ago bonuses were offered by of
licers to induce others above them to
retire In order that the lower number
officer could be promoted to a higher
grade before his retirement and thus
obtain higher rank and increased re
tired pay than he would otherwise get
in the natural course of promotion.
This practice has ceased, but the fact
that as captains the retired pay is
$1500 less than that of rear admiral is
likely, in some cases, to put off volun
tary retirement until the higher grade
has been reached.
Notwithstanding the frequently oc
curring retirements In our navy, on
account of age or from other causes,
the flow of promotion to command rank
at an age when an officer is ordinarily
In the prime of life and mentally and
physically sound and vigorous is still
exceedingly slow, and will be so for
ten years to come unless the general
law regarding retirements is changed.
As it is now there is nothing to pre
vent an officer, remaining on the active
list until he reaches the age limit of
62 years.
COMPULSORY RETIREMENT PLAN
Secretary Moody recommends com
pulsory retirement of officers who, at
1 50 years, have not become captains,
| and retirement of captains who have
not reached the grade at 55 years. As
shown in the appended table, eleven
rear admirals in command of squad
i rons range In ages from CO years 10
months to 57 years 4 months, and aver
age 59 years S months, while In the
British and German navies the aver
ages are about five years less. The
battleship captains in our navy, now
ranging from 59 years 6 months to o*5
years 2 months, should be reduced to
an average not to exceed 50 years:

UPBUI LDING OF NAVIES.
The naval budget of, Italy for the
year from July 1, 1904, to July 1, 1905,
eall3 for $25,438,225, or $2000 less than
that allowed for, the present financial
year. For new building, machinery
and armament $4,240,000 is proposed, an
Increase of $91,850 over present appro
priations. The only new vessels to be
built are two submarine boats to have
a surface speed of fourteen knots and
capable of traveling 2000 miles without
replenishing their supply of means for
locomotion.
Germany will have two new 13,200
ton battleships, the Braunschweig and
Elsass, in commission during 1904, to
be followed by the Hessen, Prussen and
Brandenburg in 1905. The . latter, , of
10,060 tons, built in 1891, ha3 been re
constructed and the other three ships
of that class are also being modernized
at a cost of $750,000. .
The German admiralty has assigned
a naval constructor to the home squad

The block is exceptionally handsome and is
level. The streets are graded, macadamized
and sewered, and everything ready for the
builder. A new feature has been inaugurated
in the sale of this property In the enforcement
of the following restrictions, which are made
for the' protection cf all and whlqh, we have
no doubt, will ad^'much-to the value of the
land and be appreciated by all real home seek-
ers.
No lot will . be sold for any but residence
properties, including not more than two flats.
No stores, churches, etables. coal yards or
any objectionable buildings. The manner of
enforcing these restrictions will* be explained
fully at pur office.
The idea is to make It possible for you to buy
a lot and build a home without being ruined
or damaged by neighboring buildings. Thou-
sands of people in this city who have built de-
sirable homes have "had them ruined by three-
story flats, stores, coal yards, etc. Owing to
the restrictions a*nd the large lots, this block
will be built up into select restdence property
and will become very valuable.
It will pay you to buy a larse lot instead of
a 25-foot lot. as you can save the price of the
extra land In the cost of your building, and be-
sides this secure an abundance "of* light and
gun and build a more artistic home.
Our agent will be on the block Sunday with
diagram, or you may call at our office for
more -complete information. But take our ad-
vice and see the property at once.

SAVE SAILORS
OF KENTIGERN
German Liner Albino Sighted
as Ship Is* About to Sink and
Crew Is Taken Into Port
STEERING GEAR DISABLED
Vessel Tosses Helplessly for
Several Days in a Terrific
Storm and Is Abandoned
NEW YOR^:, Feb. 21.â The German
Soloman Line steamer Albino, Captain
Kudenhol, which arrived from Ham
burg to-day, brought to port Captain
Parker and twenty-one shipwrecked
men belonging to the British freight
steamer Kentigern, which they aban
doned at sea on February 16 In a sink
ing condition.
â  Speaking of the sinking of the ship
Captain Parker said:
"We sailed from Portland on Sun
day, February 1, bound , for Limerick,
with a full cargo of grain. On Tues
day, while running in a heavy sea, the
steering gear became disabled, but was
repaired. It was not strong enough,
however, to withstand the violent gale
of the following Saturday and it broke
down again. An effort was made to
connect the handgear, but owing to the
darkness and terrific sea it could not
be repaired and' on the morning of the
14th we discovered the handsteering
gear broken to pieces, the wheel gone
and a complete wreck. By Monday the
gale had increased to a hurricane, the
cabins were flooded and the ship was
lying at an angle of 30 degrees. The
rudder was adrift, moving from side
to side violently, and it was impossible
to get any lashing to hold it firm. The
steamer Albino finally came in sight
and urgent signals were made to at
tract her attention. The Albino -took
all hands on board.' The chief officer
of the Kentigern had his arm broken.
The Kentigern yt-as built at Glasgow in
188S and was owned by Troop & Sons.

expressing itself favorably regarding
recognition of the republic of Panama,
but intimating a desire to extend that
recognition jointly with the Govern
ment of Chile in order that it might
carry greater moral force.
â¢ The official paper says the foregoing
lacks foundation, for the Mexican Gov
ernment has addressed no note on the
subject to the Government of Chile.
It has done nothing more than en
deavor, through its representatives, to
ascertain the sentiment and policy of
other governments of this continent
regarding the matter without endeav
oring to act in concert with any of
them. jÂ»

PLAN TO VOTE
ON THE TREATY
Senator Morgan Will Offer a
Few Amendments and Discus
sion Will Be Executive
RESULT KNOWN TUESDAY
After Disposing of the Panama
Question the Senate Will
Take Up Agricultural Bill
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21.â The Pana
ma Canal Question will continue to
hold the exclusive attention of the Sen
ate until next Tuesday, when voting
will begin on the treaty. It is probable
that the doors of the chamber will be
closed the most of the time the treaty
is under consideration Monday and
Tuesday. Senator Morgan has prepared
a number of amendments, and if of
fered^they will be presented in execu
tive 'session. Morgan probably will
speak on some of his amendments, but
the prospect is that very few other Sen-
ators will desire further to discuss the
treaty or any amendment to it. All
amendments will be voted down. There
will be only sixteen or seventeen votes
or pairs against the ratification of the
convention. Senator Hoar will prob
ably make another speech before the
vote is taken. > â¢ N
With the Panama Question disposed
of the Senate will take up appropria
tion bills, giving preference to the ag
ricultural bill. There are features in
this measure which will arouse opposi
tion and it is expected that will be de
bated at some length, j By the^time the
agricultural bill shall be passed the
legislative, executive and Judicial ap
propriation bill will have been reported,
to be soon followed by the naval, pen-
sion and army bills.
Monday being "Washington's birthday
the Senate will listen to the reading of
Washington's farewell address by Sen-
ator Heyburn of Idaho.
. The House has the naval bill under
debate and at the proper time it is
probable a rule will be brought in
making the item in the bill providing
for a training station on the great
lakes in order. It is expected that a
contest will ensue over the location of
the station. Notice has been given by
Hitchcock of Nebraska that he will
propose an amendment to the naval
bill providing for the construction of
a Government armor-plate factory. The
Indian and the district appropriation
bills will follow the naval bill and there
is some expectation that all of these
will be passed this week by the House.
At the first lull during the week the
bill providing for a committee to in
vestigate and report on the shipping
industry may be called up under a rule
limiting debate to a few hours. Fol
lowing the Indian and district bills
will come the postofflce appropriation
bill, but it may not be ready for con
sideration before next week. If the
appropriation bills are all out of the
way bv Friday the private claims or
pensions bill may have a show.
Williams, the minority leader, served
notice yesterday that he would endeav
or to secure the reading to-morrow of
Washington's farewell address and
then have an immediate adjournment.
AMENDING IiAWS ON
FOREST RESERVATIONS
Bili Introduced in Senate Provides
That Lands in Railroad Grants
Shall Be Exempted.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21. â Senatof
Hansbrought has introduced a bill which
provides that no forest reservation
hereafter be created covering any
lands within the limits of any railroad
grant. It is provided further that
where a tract of land covered by an
unperfected bona fide claim or by a
patent, is included within the limits of
a public forest reservation hereafter
created, the settler or owner may re
linquish the tract to the Government
and receive in return full compensation
as may be agreed upon between the
Secretary of the Interior and the party
so relinquishing. Any exchange of
lands which hereafter may be surren
dered within a forest reserve hereto
fore created shall be allowed only for
lands of a like character, whether such
exchange is made through the medium
of land script, right of selection or
otherwise.
The Corinthian Canal.
"Speaking: o.f canals," said the en
gineer who had been talking about Pan
ama, "a very interesting canal, amd one
not much heard of, is that connecting
the 'gulf of - Corinth and the gulf of
Aegina, in Greece. It's some older than
any we have in the western hemisphere,
also, for Periander, tyrant of Corinth,
proposed to cut through the isthmus as
long ago as â¢ 600 years before Christ.
Superstition stopped him, however. Ju
lius-Caesar and Caligula took it up
again when Rome had hold of Greece,
but it was too much for them. Then
came Nero, and he went at it with
vigor,- but the work stopped when he
died. Others kept pounding away at it
for the next several hundred years, but
it was not until 1881 that real work of
the Nero energy was put upon it. Then
General Turr, aid-d^e-camp to Victor
Emmanuel of Italy, organized a com
pany and worked on till the money
gave out, in 1S90, the chief obstacle be
ing some kind of a flint which dynamite
couldn't break.
"About $10,000,000 .was spent up to
1890, and then Mr. Snygros took hold,
organized a new company with $965,000
working capital and finished the job in
1S93. It is only about four miles long,
but it is sixty-nine feet wide at the bot
tdm, about eighty at water line, twen
ty-six feet three inches deep in water
and it is cut nearly al^ the way through
solid , rock, rising at some points for
269 feet above the canal. It is like a
canyon and ships do not- take kindly
to it, the entrance being bad, a strong
wind blowing through it as through a
great air shaft,. and there is at times a
strong reverse current. It is an inter
esting trip through the canal, and it
saves 123 miles of very rough ' water
and twenty hours of time; but so far
skippers prefer to go around the penin
sula rather than through the canal,
though .with some changes which will
be made it is believed the canal will be
come of. general use as soon as a few
ships; begin to .use it and remove the
prejudice now existing against it."â

ITALY TO IMPRISON
MLNMYHO CIRCULATE
FALSE AVAR RUMORS
ROME, Feb. 2J-â Rrnvors of warlike
preparations by Italy having been cir
culated, a semi-ofilcln.! communication
has rmanated from the Government.
â which :s in substance as follows:
Stories of alleged armaments and of
tjiÂ« movements of warships and troops
for service abroad are entirely false.
Indications exist that this false news
is'Vonnected with Stock Exchange
speculation, and those responsible
have, been brought before the 'aw
courts to be punished according to the
law, \vith imprisonment for three to
thirty months."
The communication evidently. allude3
to the insistence by a portion of the
press that Italy will be antagonistic to
Austria in the Balkans and U* the pre
dictions of international complications,
thus causing a fall In Italian bonds and
a rise In the exchange on gold.
SCANDAL IXYOLVES
' AMERICAN AT THE
: COURT OF SEOUL
â¢ LONDON, Feb. 21.â According to the
"Nagr&saki correspondent of the Daily
Telegraph, while William F. Sands, the
Emperor of Korea's adviser, was en
tertaining officers of the French cruiser
Pascal and a number of other friends
at dinner la his official residence in
fieoul. some geographical and statistical
maps and papers were stolen. This
caused a great scandal and necessitated
Sands' withdrawal.
Sands was appointed United State*
secretary cf legation in President Mc-
Kinley'B first administration. In 1SD3
he became adviser to the Korean Gov
ernment, succeeding two other Ameri
cans/ Early in 1902 the announcement
of Sands* resignation was received in
Washington, but the reason for his
withdrawal was not then made public.
"If you were offered three wishes,
George, dear, what would they be?"
"Money, money,- money."
"Why, George, I thought you'd wish
to have me."
"Oh, I'd get you fast enough if I had
the money."â Cleveland Plain Dealer.
SPEEDY HOUNDS
COURSE GAMELY
Important Double Stake Event
â¢Attracts a Record Breaking
Attendance to Union Park
Â»
YOUNGSTERS SHOW SPEED
Eight Fast Dogs Will Com
pete for Final Honors in Cali
fornia Plate Stake To-Day
The wet weather did not keep the
crowd away from Union Coursing Park
yesterday. From the time the first
course started at 11 in the morning till
the last one was run off at dusk the
interested ones thronged the grand
stand and betting ring. Such a gala
day has not been known at the park
for a long time.
It was a great day's sport. The first
round of the Belle Brandon stake for
the youngsters proved to be a star
event and brought out a lot of likely
ones. Every puppy slipped showed in
good form and for first timers the young
dogs Qemonstrated they were record
breakers and due to perform in good
style before long.
But the real event of the day was the
California Plate stake in which all the
champion hounds were entered. Three
rounds of the stake were run down,
when darkness interfered .and brought
the day's sport to an abrupt dose.
The local dogs shone brightty in the
plate stake. No less than five of them
are still in the going and ; Â£jey all seem
to have a good chance to get away
with the final honors to-day. Thu
home hounds include Mount Rose, Palo
j Alto, Reta S, Sea Lion and Full. Moon.
Full lloon seems to be the favored dog
with the wise followers of the game,
though there are many who concede
Sea Lion a chance.
Sacramento Boy and Tillie R, the
two capital city dogs remaining in the
stake, ran in great form yesterday.
Both will prove stumbling blocks in the
final event and each has a good chance
to land the stake. The only imported
dog to last till the fourth round was
Gambit. He is still in the going and as
he showed a world of speed yesterday
he may be one of the good things.
For the Belle Brandon stake Flower
Girl is thought to be the best of the
bunch. She performed in grand style
for a youngster yesterday and has a
splendid cl ce of finishing with 'the
headliners. Freda is also men
tioned as a likely candidate, though it
is almost a certainty that Flower Girl
| will rule a bis Â£a\ *e.
A consolation Siako for the thirty
two dogs beaten in the first round of
the California Plate e'vent yesterday
will be run off to-day. The sport will
be ushered in this morning with the
second round. of the. - y Belle Brandon
stake. Then the first round of the con
solation will be run down, then the
fourth round of th? Belle Brandon
stake. The last three rounds of the
three stakes will wind up the two days'
sport. Following are the results with

MOIST COURTS
PREVENT PLAY
Tennis Matches at East Oak
land Postponed on Account of
the Threatening Weather
DRAWINGS TAKE PLACE
Twenty-Seven Teams Entered
in the Doubles Tournament
and Good Sport Is Promised
No matches were played in the Ala
meda County , championship tourna
ment yesterday on account of the wet
weather. Twenty-seven teams enter
ed the doubles tourney and were
drawn yesterday. The best teams
drew in the lower half and conse
quently the most interesting matches
will be played in the early rounds.
J. D. MacGavin and Robert Variel,
the crack team representing the Cali
fornia Club and University of Cali
fornia, drew the Baker brothers of the
Golden Gate Club in the preliminary
round. These two teams are probably
the strongest in the tourney and it is
unfortunate they should draw each
other.
The Murdock brothers, Alameda's
best men, will meet the winners of the
Baker brothers-MacGavin and "Variel
match in the second round. Hamil
ton Murdock did not play well in the
singles and his brother is a very errat
ic player. Of these three teams, the
Baker brothers are the most evenly
balanced and by far the steadiest. If
Variel. who has not played for several
months, gives MacGarvin any kind of
support the college men should cap
ture the championship.
The Baker brothers are hard to
beat, but their lobbing will just suit
MacGavin and Variel. In the upper
half, Clarence Griffin and Carl Gar
dener are the strongest team and
should gain a place in the finals. The
only teams in the half that have a
chance are George James and H. Rus
sell and G. Finch and Horace Mann.
The chances of the last named team
are poor, but those of Russell and
Janes are not unfavorable.
The final match x will probably be
interesting, but would have been much
more so had one of the three best
teams drawn ifc the upper half. Grif
fin and Gardener play well, but the
Baker brothers and MacGavin and
Vciriel rather outclass them.
The drawing resulted as follows:
Preliminary roundâ S. Talcott and H. Mill
wain vs. S. Webster and G. Gage; Lee. and
Robbins vs C. Griffin and C. Gardner; G.
James and H. Ru.-sell vs. E. M. Otis and

HANDBALL EXPERTS PLAY
AN* INTERESTING MATCH
Bonnet and Cunningham Defeat Fitz
gerald and Levy After .Three
Hard-Fouglit Games.
One of the most exciting handball
matches played at the Olympic Club in
months was the one yesterday between
Champion Fitzgerald and Louis Levy
and George Cunningham and Jack
Bonnet. Three games were played and
the final gamtf was taken by Bonnet
and Cunningham by a single point.
There was a big crowd present and the
clever work of the players was heartily
applauded.
Fitz did not play up to form in his
matches. Once^in a while he showed
a flash of championship style. His
back-hand strokes at critical times
were remarkably clever. Bonnet's
tossing was extremely fast. He put
every ounce of muscle in each toss and
had â¢ Fitzgerald and Levy guessing.
Cunningham did not play well in the
first part of the game, but made a
"Garrison" finish. Levy played a con-
sistent game.
In the final game Bonnet led with a
score of 17 to 13. Levy then tossed
eome low ones and Fitzgerald killed the
weak returns. Levy secured seven
points and the score was 20 to 17. Fitz
was put out on a "kill" by Cunningham
and the ultimate victors went in and
Bonnet served two on FitzgeraVd be
fore he was put out. Cunningham was
an easy out. Levy could do nothing
and Fitz, in his anxiety to return the
ball, used his back-hand stroke and
also went out. Bonnet by a pretty
"kill" won the match. Scores: 15-21,
21-18, 21 7 20.

EASY VICTORY
FOR SAN MATEO
Cosmopolitan Polo Team Out
classed in First Game for
Raoul Duval Challenge Cup
LOSERS ARE HANDICAPPED
Tom Driscoll's Pony Stumbles
and Plucky Rider Narrowly
Escapes* a Painful Injury
DEL MONTE, Feb. 21.â The San
Mateo pclolsts galloped all over, th"e
Cosmopolitans to-day in the first match
for the Raoul Duval challenge cup,
winning ultimately by a score of eight
goals to two. The teams lined up in
the following order:
' San Mateo teamâ W. McCreery, R.
M. Tobin, L. McCreery, J. Lawson.
Cosmopolitansâ R. Chaplin, T. A. Dris
coll, C. Raoul Duval, W. S. Hobart.
Refereeâ F. J. Mackey. Umpireâ E.
Ezra. Timekeeperâ Cyril Tobin.
The Cosmopolitans were badly handi
capped from the start. Walter Hobart
could not use two *of his favorite po
nies, owing to injuries they received
in Friday's game, and had to borrow
Peter Martin's ponies. Tom Drlscoll
went Into the game with sore muscles,
resulting from a blow he received in
the same game when he was hit in the
back with a ball.
More important than this, the play
ers were in positions with which they
were not familiar and there was no
semblance of team work. Walter Ho
bart was all at sea as "back" and
made a poor shewing in that position,
with which he. is not familiar. He has
been playing a star game as number
three during the present meeting. He
mixed up in none of the scrimmages
yesterday, contenting himself with can
tering around on the outside awaiting
a chance at the ball.
The game was brought to an abrupt
termination early in the last period.
Walter Hobart was running the ball
down the field and Tom Driscoll. who
was mounted on his fast pon* Si, was
clearing the way for him by riding
off R. M. Tobin. Mr. Drlscoll's pony
suddenly stumbled arid both horse and
rider turned a complete somersault.
The shock of the fall was met by the
rider's cork lined cap, which saved him
from serious injury, as Y as tossed
clear off his pony. Heci. cut of the*
fall with only a strained wrist.
The pony fell on his own shoulder
and this stopped his impetus notice
ably. It had the effect of rolling him
over on his back, where he lay for an
instant kicking his legs in the air.
He was up then and galloped off the
field. This incident brought the game
to an end. The San Mateo team proved
Its superiority from the time the first
ball was tossed in. â¢
The McCreery broths, j, R. M. Tobin
and Lawson all played a brilliant dash
ing game. They secured possession of
the ball at once and ran it down the
field, just missing a goal. Shortly after
the Sah Mateo men claimed one of
their opponents were off side ' and let
up in their play. During the momen
tary lull Walter McCreery scored and
it was allowed to stand. The San
Mateo men nearly scored before the end
of the period.
They were allowed a free stroke at
the opening of the next period on a
foul. The ball went hear the goal, but
Lawrence McCreery, who played a
great game, sent it out and ran it
across the field, just missing a goal.
The ball traveled up the field again
and R. M. Tobin repeated McCreery's
performance, finally scoring.
The San Mateo men scored their first
goal in this period. Walter Hobart ran
the ball down the field and placed it
for Duval, who scored. Later in the
period, the San Mateo men sent the ball
to the edge of the .goal, but could not
put it through.
Lawson scored twice in the third pe
riod for the Cosmopolitans. Each time
he had a clear shot from the fcrty-flve
yard line, no opponent being there to
interfere. He placed the ball between
the posts. In the fourth period, Wal
ter McCreery placed the ball and Law
son scored. Shortly after Walter Mc-
Creery got possession and scored un
aided. Tom Driscoll drove from the
eighty-yard line and the ball landed
in the mouth of the goal, but did not
roll over the line. Walter Hobart
scored the second and last goal for his
side in this period. '
R.. M. Tobin and Lawson scored In
the fifth period, making the score 8 to
2, at which it remained.
RUSH ORDER FOR NEW
CRUISER THE CRAMPS
BUILT FOR TURKEY
PHILADELPHIA. Feb. 21^-The
cruiser Medjidia, built for the Imperial
Ottoman navy at Cramps, is under
hurry orders to get home. She "will
leave here on March 1 and will carry
her own flag. It had been intended to
take the vessel to Constantinople and
deliver her there to the Turkish naval
authorities, but a change in this plan
was found necessary and the ship will
be put into commission and unfurl her
flag at this port. .
Captain Ransford DI Bucknam of
Cramps' shipyard, who will take the
cruiser across, has been commissioned
a captain in the Ottoman navy and
will put her into commission. It also
will be ; necessary to commission the
ether officers. 1 \ !
The Medjidia will leave port^ fully
ready for a naval "engagement. ' â¢ Her
guns, all of the latest pattern in use
in the United States navy, were made
in Bethlehem, Pa. All are practically
in place." The V magazines are to* be
filled With ammunition, as if for a war
cruise. As soon as the cruiser reaches
the sea the trial of all her guns" will
be begun. This will be made-practi
cally thorough. '
In view of the haste with which the
builders have been charged to â  deliver
the- ship, only two ' stops will be ' made
on " the long run to Constantinople.
The trip will ' require about twenty
days and it may be that a final speed
test will be made somewhere off the
Island of Crete. '.. >
The 'exact cause of- the hurry orders
has not yet been explained.
THISTLES PLAY
IN FINE FORM
Star-Spangled Scotchmen Beat
Vampires 3 Goals to 0 on
Presidio Athletic Grounds
FIELD WET AND SLIPPERY
Winners Are Sure of Champion
ship of the California Asso
ciation ; Football League
The Presidio athletic grounds were
in bad condition yesterday, the sur
face being soaked with water and so
slippery that it was not possible to
play in the center of the field. The
goal posts were taken up and set on
the east side of the ground, where the
covering of grass is thick, a playing
area of 110 yards by CO yards being
marked off. As - these arrangements
occupied some time, the match between
the Albion Rovers and Independents
for the championship of the California
Association Football League .was not
played, though the teams went out and
amused the , spectators by a little
friejndly practice with the ball.
In spitÂ£ of the rain a large number
of spectators gathered in the grand
stand to witness the game between the
Vampires and Thistles. At 3:10 p. m.
"Wilding kicked the ball off for the
Vampires. The Thistles, who were play
ing with" the wind, kept the ball down
near the Vampires' goal and after five
minutes' play secured a corner kick,
which landed in front of the post, but
was well saved by Alrth.' Then the
Thistles put the ball at goal again, but
It just tipped the top of the crossbar.
Twenty* minutes after the ball had
been put into play Duncan scored the
first goal for the Thistles from a splen-
did kick. -
A little later Airth headed the ball
into goal from a kick of A. Disher,
scoring the second goal for the
Scotchmen. Before the end of the first
half Lydon scored a third goal.
After the change of ends the Vam
pires made several determined efforts,
but were unable to score. During this
period Airth, the Vampire goalkeeper,
received a nasty kick and had to leave
the field. T^heberge took charge of the
goal and saved some shots.
Near the end of the game Petersen
went into the forward line of the Vam
pires. Neither side scored again and
the match ended 3 goals to 0 in favor
of the Thistles. The victory of the
Scotch team was due to the excellent
combination work of the forwards and
the good all around team play.
For the Vampires Petersen at full
back, Glarner in the halfback line,
with Lees and Kay on the left wing,
did the best work. Team play, how
ever, was lacking among the Vampire
forwards. C W. Irish was referee,
with Bradley and Churchill as lines
men. The teams occupied the following
positions:
Thistles. Positions. Vampires.
Lowe :... Goalkeeper Airth
Forrest.. Left back Petersen
Tierney Right back Theberge
Taylor Left halfback Harwood
Duncan Center halfback Turner
McGregor Right halfback Glarner
A. Disher. Outside left. Lees
T. Disher ..Inside left Kay
T. S. . Lydcn Center forward Wilding
J. Smith.. Inside right..' Showell
R. A. Disher Outside right Buchly
The Thistles are now sure of the
championship of the California As
sociation Football League. They have
played ten matches and. have scored
nineteen points. They have two more
matches to play and these they are
practically certain to win, so that their
score at the end of the season will be
twenty-three points out of a possible
twenty-four.
The Vampires have played all their
twelve scheduled matches and, having,
lost two and drawn two, have a score
of eighteen points. The Independents
have played ten matches and hava
fifteen points to their credit. If they
win their two remaining matches they
will have nineteen points to their
credit and will take second place. If
it should so happen that the Thistles
lose both their remaining matches and
the Independents win both theirs, there
would be a tie for the championship.
HOW MUCH FOOD ;^j
. SHOULD WE EAT?
One Rule Says the Smallest Amount
That Will Preserve Good . .;V T
Health.
How shall one determine, then,
how much, food to eat? Too much
mystery has been thrown about this
subject. Let your sensations decide.
It must be kept in mind that the en
tire function of digestion and assimi
lation is carried on without conscious
supervision or concurrence. It should
be entirely unfelt and unknown, ex
cepting by the feeling of bien-etre
which accompanies and follows its
normal accomplishment. Satiety is
bad. . It implies a sensation of full
ness in the region of the stomach, and
that means that too much food has
been taken. The. exact correspond
ence, in a healthy animal, between the
appetite and the amount of- food re
quired is extraordinary. As a rule,
the meal, unless eaten very slowly,
should cease before the appetite is en
tirely satisfied. Because a little time
is required for the outlying organs and
tissues to feel the effects of the food
that has .been, ingested. If too little
has been taken it is easy enough to
make it up at the next meal, and the
appetite will be only the better and
the food more grateful.
No one was ever^sorry for having
voluntarily eaten too little, while mil
lions: every â¢ day repent having eaten
too much. It. has been said that the
great, lesson homeopathy taught the
world: was this: That, whereas physi
cians had been -in the habit of giving
the patient- .the 'â  largest dofee he could
stand, they have, been led to see that
their purpose was better subserved by
giving, him -â¢ the smallest dose that
would ' produce the desired effect.
And so it is with food. Instead of eat
ing,', as most-people unfortunately do.
as much they they can, they should
eat the smallest amount that will keep
them in good health.^â The Century-
. "I tell you it keeps me busy these
days trying to earn my salary," said

I'm earning my salary." â Chicago Trib

Veteran August Jungblut Car
ries Oif Honors in Schuet
zen Club's Bnllseye Event
â¢There was considerable rivalry yes
terday among the marksmen who gath
ered at Schuetzen Park. W. F. Blasse
and J. Kullmann ran a very close race
at the pistol target for the L. C. Babin
trophy. Blasse bested his comrade by
Just one ring. ' The score of the winner
was 93, 88, 87â268, and Kullmann gave
him a close call with 91, 88, 88â267.
In the medal competition of the Grutll
Club Al Gehret did fine work, making
441 rings in his twenty-shot medal
string. His nearest competitor was A.
Studer, with 416 to his credit.
Captain F. Kommer showed the Tur
ners' Schuetzen that he could lead
them as well in shooting as in march
ing. The good score of 213 rings in his
ten-shot string was the highest on the
company target during the day's con
test.
In the bullseye shooting of the Cali
fcrnia Schuetzen Club the honors were
won by veterap August Jungblut, who
made the best center shot of the day
and was far ahead of all his competi
tors. So close was his shot to a dead
center that it required the use of a
measuring machine to determine its
exact distance from perfection.

The Pointing of the Compass.
We commonly say that the pole of the
needle points toward the north. The
poets tell us how the needle is true to
the pole. Every reader, however, is
now familiar with the general fact of a
variation of the compass on our east
ern seaboard, Â«nd all the way across
the Atlantic, the north pointing of the
compass varies so far to the west that
a ship going to Europe and making no
allowance for this deviation would find
herself making, more nearly for the
North Cape than â  for her destination.
The ''declination," as it is termed in
scientific language, varies from one re
gion of the earth to another. In some
places It is; toward the west, in others
toward the east.
The pointing of the needle in various
regions of the world la shown by means
of magnetic maps. Such maps are
published by the United States Coast
Survey, whose. experts make a careful
study . of , the magnetic force all over
the country. It is found that there is a
line running nearly north and south
through the middle States along which
there is no variation of the compass.
To the east of it the variation is west;
to the west of it, east. The most rapid
changes in the pointing of the needle
are toward the northeast and north-
west regions. When we travel to" the
northeastern boundary of Maine .the
westerly variation has risen to twenty
degrees. Toward : the northwest the
easterly variation continually increases,
until, in the northern part of the State
of it amounts to twenty
three degrees.â Harper's Magazine.

important occasion for the lovers of
sports and outdoor pastimes. If the
weather permits there will be a score
of interesting athletic events in and
about the city, including racing, polo,
association football, tennis, golf and
coursing.
The carnival of water sports and

will likely make the journey from this
city, as all the principal places of bus-
iness will be closed.
The remaining rounds of the Belle
Brandon cup, and the California
plate, together with a thirty-two dog
consolation stake, will be run down
at Union Coursing Park. All the
champion hounds are carded. A great
day's sport will surely result from the

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, -FEBRUARY 22. 1904.
SAYS PRISON CELLS SHOULD NEVER
BE KNOWN TO YOUTHFUL OFFENDERS
Judge B. B. Lindsey of Juvenile Court of Denver Delivers Instruc
tive Speech Before the State Conference of Charities and Cor
rections, Which Opens Its Third Annual Session in This City
The third annual session ef the State
Conference of Charities and Correc
tions was begun last night at the First
Unitarian Church, corner of Geary and
Franklin streets. Frank J. Symmes,
president of the conference, rresided.
The edifice was crowded with an inter
ested audience.
Preliminary sessions were held yes
terday morning. Dr. Samuel G. Smith
occupied the pulpit of the First Con
gregational Church and Ben B. Lind
sey, Judge of the Juvenile Court of
Denver, talked at the First Presbyte
rian Church.
The conference will cover three days,
sessions being held in the mornings,
afternoons and evenings. Last night
at the G-pening of the conference, Pres
ident Symmes made' the opening ad
dress and gave a brief outline of the
work accomplished by the charities of
the State.
Judge Lindsey, the originator of the
Juvenile Court, spoke on "The Child
and the State." Judge Lindsey came
all the way from Colorado to tell the
people of California what has been
done and what can be done In the mat
ter of child trainingâ the care of chil
dren who are criminally inclined.
BAD INFLUENCES.
Judge Lindsey is deemed one of the
best authorities, if not the best, in the
United States on the subject. He has
addressed many such conferences in all
parts of the .country and has been in
dorsed by all of them. He said in part:
The problem Is a vast one. The boys of to
day are the men of to-morrow. The boys may
have started on their career of crime throuKh
bad home influences. Improper training or by
associating with bad companions. The punish
ment of these corrupted individuals U not a
successful method of preventing them from
committing crimes. In the cases of con
firmed criminals this Is all that can be done.
Every year the number cf inmates in the re
formatories is Increased, one-half of them,-be
ing little boys and girls. English prison offi
cials report that the years between the ages
of 10 and 20 are the criminal years, and that
between 10 and 16 years is the most essential
time for the curbing of the young man or girl
and Influencing his or her character in such a
manner that they are taken from the clutches
of criminal instincts.

PAYS TRIBUTE
TO PATRIOTS
Rev. William Rader Reviews
American Advancement Since
Period of George Washington
"From Washington to Roosevelt" was
the subject of " a sermon. by the Rev.
William Rader at tha Third CongVe
gational Church last evening.;
Th'e pulpit was /adorned with several
handsome silk American flags and in the
front rows were seated 100' members
of the cadet corps of the Third Con
gregational Church with their officers,
Captain R. B. Moore, In command, First
Lieutenant A. A. Moore and ' Second
Lieutenant W. C. Olsen. â¢ 4
The Rev. Mr. Rader said that upon
that occasion he wished particularly
to devote his thoughts to the cadets,
and to the many other young "men
present. The history of George Wash
ington, he said, was Inspiring to the
youth of to-day. ;The great, man's,
career was dramatic and began in
early life. , '. . .' j
He asked them "to think of .the. great
things that have been achieved in' tha
land since George Washington; .was
President, since the 'day when in New
York City he was received with accla
mation by the populace and took the
oath as the first President of this re
public, which to-day is' a world power.
Dr. Rader ventured to say that if
Washington could return" he would bs
much surprised at the enormous ad
vancement, with the material growth
of the country, with its population of
nearly 80,000,000 souls. He asked his
congregation to contrast the early days
with the present, the first' navy with
the powerful sea force now, the first
army of brave men with the greater,
army that had . done service , at the
time of the Civil War and in the Philip
pines and. Cuba. Could 'George} Wash
ington come to us he would behold_ the
flag reaching far over , the r seas and
wcUld realize that San Francisco Is
the center of commerce. He would ap-'
predate, indeed,; how -.well ? he laid ; the.
foundation of this great republic
Then, said the Rev. Mr. Rader, \ the

WHO WILL DISCUSS
QUESTION OF CHARITIES.
children in proportion to the populations by
ages arrested 'every twelve months in the
large cities of this country as there are adults.
To reform a child by putting it in Jail is as
wise as It would be to attempting to cure It
of an illness by putting it in the way of in
fection. A child found guilty of disorderly
conduct should be placed under the observa
tion of a probation officer for a certain definite
term. The officer makes visits to the neigh
borhood in which the child lives and finds out
how it is conducting itself. Once every two
weeks the little offender is requested to report
to the court, bringing with it a -statement
from the school teacher as to what he or she
has accomplished at the Institution of learning.
MONEY SAVED TO STATE.
The probation system in Denver has been a
blessing. During the first two years of the
court's existence more than 500 children were
found guilty of disorderly conduct, placed .on
probation and required to report every two
weeks. Only ten per cent of the entire num
ber of â  children brought to this court were
sent to State industrial schools. The State of
Colorado, its Governor said, has been saved
the sum bf $f-8,CC0 in less than a year and a
half by the juvenile court.
â¢ One â¢ can reason with the youngsters, end
many of them, if placed on- probation, realize
best way to honor George Washington
is to do the thing that he would have
all doâ love the flag and never lay stain
upon it.
Patriotism, he said, did -not mean
carrying a chip on one's shoulder and
challenging others to knock it off. He
did not like to see that spirit and the
man who did that was not much of a^
patriot, 'but was. instead,, very much'
of a coward. What was needed in the
practice of patriotism was â¢ peace
peace that should be" filtered down into
the trusts and the labor unions, and
the home, and every man should lovo
his country from the standpoint of
peace.
The country, .said the Rev. Mr. Rader,
has had at least four great Presidents-
George Washington^ "the framer"; ;
Abraham Lincoln, "the defender";
William* McKinley, . "the expander,"
and Theodore Roosevelt, "the in
terpreter,"' and as , the -'interpreter"
the ' name - of Roosevelt will,' too, go

ANNIVERSARY
IS OBSERVED
Interesting 1 Services Held by
the Young Men's Christian
Association in This City
The First Congregational Church, at
the corner of Post, and Mason streets,
was crowded last evening, the occasion j
being the celebration of the fiftieth an
niversary of the â  institution of the
Young Men's Christian Association. An
excellent and interesting programme,
including addresses by leading digni
taries of the association, was arranged
and the service was one long to be re
membered by those that attended.
Right Rev. J. W. Hamilton, resident
Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, delivered the principal address.
The Bishop laid particular stress on
the obligations of young men that as
pire to a higher life and of the tempta
tions that confront them. His sermon
was interspersed with illustrations
from existing conditions and was most
heartily "appreciated. In addition, the
Bishop spoke of the wonderful ad
vancement the association had made
in matters of religion, morals and edu
cation and of the benefits derived by
men â both young and old â from its
labors. . The night schools, attended by
thousands who have no other source
of enlightenment, was one of the prin
cipal subjects of the discourse and thÂ«
necessity of sustaining this adjunct
was emphasized.
The exercises opened with an organ
prelude, after which the choir rendered
a selection, "The God of Israel." A
reading of, the first psalm and prayer,
followed by Rev. George C. Adams,' and
hymns and offerings occupied the time
'until Bishop Hamilton's remarks. H. J.
McCoy, secretary of the local associa
tion,; then made a brief statement, fol
lowing the lines pursued .by : Bishop
Hamilton and relating incidents of the
work that has been accomplished in
this city. Mr. McCoy spoke of the
crowded: condition of: the night school
and of the duty of those that cared for
the advancement of j moral and intel
lectual training to â  expand the 'â  facilities
for,'learning. /

RIDER NARROWLY ESCAPES
BEING KILLED BY A CAR
Louis McNally Races Alons Railroad
Track and Receives Broken Leg
in Collision. â¢
Louis McNally narrowly escaped
death last night by colliding with an
electric car in South San Francisco.
As a result of the collision he received
a broken leg, while the horse he was
riding was instantly killed.
McNally, who claims to have been a
jockey, was riding through Butcher
town with three friends. They were all
under the influence of alcohol.
While meandering along the track at
a moderate speed one of the brave
riders espied an electric car speeding on
its way southward. McNally likewise
sighted the oncoming car and through
his half ciosed orbs it looked to him
like a horse flying down the home
stretchr With jaws set he dug his
spurs into his .unwilling steed and
joined the race. For a time it looked to
McNally like a sure thing and he was
coming in on the money a 1 to 2 shot.
In an attempt to foul his fast adver
sary he crossed in front. Instead of
cutting the car off, however, there wa3
a crash.
The dust finally settled and McNally
was sent to the Receiving Hospital.
He had broken his leg, but the horse
had fared worse. The noble animal
had gone his last race, for his remains
were found lying along the last fifty
yards of the stretch.
