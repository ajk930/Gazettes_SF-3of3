The ways and means of obtaining
funds for the great work of shackling
the floods in, the Sacramento and San

organized River Improvement and
Drainage Association /of California.
The Maple room at the Palace was
again filled with substantial represen

the freshets. They listened with evi
dent interest to an able address by Ed
ward F. ; Adams on the economic as
pects of the problem, and to a speech
by United States Senator George C.
Perkins, who pledged himself to work
for a â¢ national appropriation. After,
electing its. committees and completing
its permanent organization, the associ
ation then adjourned to meet again at
the call of President Rufus P. Jennings.

Newchwang remains quiet. More
Russian troops have entered and the
Russo-Chinese Bank has resumed
business. Several steamships are
loading at the port.
The Russians declare that no fight
is expected here, as it is their inten
tion to withdraw before the Japanese
advance. The residents, however, fear
trouble during the interregnum. Dur
ing the contemplated Russian evacua
tion of May 8 the Chunchus imme
diately advanced and attempted to
commit robberies in the outskirts of
the city. About fifty shots were ex
changed within hearing distance of the
foreign settlement. The native fought
the Chunchus, killing three of them.
The*brigands were under / an impres
sion that the Russians had evacuated
the place during the night. This
strengthens the belief that further at
tacks will be made, should the port be
unprotected.
According to Japanese representa
tives, 5000 Japanese, troops are forty
miles southeast of Tashichao, occupy
ing the walled city of Tangchl. No
trains are running from Tashichao to
the south.
The Chunchus are getting bolder
and have attacked Russian scouting
parties, who repulsed the brigands
with considerable loss.
The morale of the Russian troops
is said to be generally improving since
the enemy retired toward Fengwang
cheng.
The west wall of Liaoyang has been
pulled down and the material utilized
in constructing covered trenches and
fortifications extending from the
mountains on the Fengwangcheng
road to the Liao River. Thousands of
Chinese anchors have been conveyed
to Liaoyang, to be used in anchoring
pontoon bridges. Probably the great
est battle of the war will be fought
in the vicinity of Liaoyang, where
General Kuropatkin is determined to
check the Japanese advance.
Japanese reinforcements are arriv
ing dally at Pitzewo and Polandien.
A Russian torpedo-boat flotilla is

[might cost twenty millions.
: "The Economic Aspect: Who Should
! Provide the Funds?" was the subject
i discussed by Edward F. Adams, agri
| cultural editor of the Chronicle, in one
of the most noteworthy addresses de
livered before the convention. Briefly
stated, Adams' argument was that a
large but equitable share of the cost
should fall upon the land owners in the
river districts, who would be the prin
cipal beneficiaries of the improvement;
that the whole State should be taxed at
a low rate to carry out the pledge as
sumed when these lands were ceded to
! it by the national Government, and
1 that when the State and the owners
united in taking up these burdens in
earnest, there would be no difficulty in
I obtaining Federal aid for the vast
project. The speaker created considÂ».
erable enthusiasm by his frank declar
ation that he believed it would proba
bly cost $20,000,000 to do the work well
and provide adequate relief for the
great valleys. The estimates of half
that sum offered by the engineers were,
he believed, prompted by timidity. The
floods could only be reduced to subjec
tion by thorough-going measures. True
economy and the welfare of the whole
State demanded that these be not
longer deferred.
"We have been working at this re
clamation problem," he said, "for forty
years and have spent millions, but we
have not reclaimed the lands and we
have not kept faith with the nation,
j^hich gave them to us. This is the re
sult of our infernal habit of 'knocking*
every man who proposes to accomplish
anything." " -
This emphatic utterande won more
applause than any other saying heard
during the convention. The substance
of Adams' paper was as follows:
Long before this convention waÂ» thought of
I had been collecting data for a paper on the
economic history and aspects of reclamation
of these swamp lands to be read before the
Commonwealth Club, a body which considers
euch subjects and of which I am a member.
In the course of my study I reached certain
conclusions, which seem to me Just and wise,
but to which I am not even personally com
mitted. If upon further examination - they do

shall require â¢ principal and interest to be paid

reclaimed lands, and no bonds to-be Issued
until the validity of the. assessment on tho,
reclaimed lands for their redemption shall have
been fully sustained by the Supreme Court

deemed best.'- provided that complete redemp

That the State ought not to appropriate an

plete plan for reclamation ha* been made

accomplishment under such Â¦ pledges of the

The cervice should be absolutely, and by the
most drnstlc legislation, removed from any
form of political influence. (Applause.)
The chief engineer should be a man of the
highest standing In hi3 profession, preferably
with experience on the Mlsislssippi River, and
the salary should be such aa to attract a man
of that kind. I do not think any California
engineer available, for the. reason that all our
hydraulic engineers are too much committed â
or would be believed'to be too .much commit
ted, which would bo about as badâ to some
particular plan.
Congress will recognize by the expenditure of
money in a Way that will materially aid recla
mation. I have thus i.ersonally reached th/j
following- tentutlve cnncluslqns:
The State should resume Â¦ entire control of
reclamation of the Sacramento and San Joa
qu:n swam:> and overflowed land.", tn formal
and permanent co-op*ration with th^ Federal
Government, which has charge of the Interest
of navigation. â¢
The State has conveyed no lands to counties,
but has merely made the counties thÂ« agents
to fulfill, through reclamation districts cre
ated by them, the State's obligation to re
claim. The State has never undertaken to
convey to purchasers of these lands any other
title than that which It possessedâ that is. a
title subject to the obligation to reclaim. No"
individual wa; obliged to aesume this burden.
Having assumed it, he can never escape .it
except by returning the lands.
The State can never escape Us
except by regrantlng the land unlncumbered,
to the Federal Government.
Some lands bought as swamp lands werei
easy of reclamation. Other lands may cost;
more to reclaim than they are worth If re/
claimed. But all the lande will pay for re
claiming all. It was the Intent of the Legis
lature to make all these lands pay for re
claiming them all. those. who were so fortunate
as to get the best lands sharing tqually in the
cost of redeeming the worst. ThlÂ« last posi
tion has never been sustained by the Supreme
Court because, as I believe, it has never, been
squarely presented. All the other positions. I
think will be found sustained.
I feel pretty certain that whenever this
State takes uii the question, of redeeming Its
pledge to the nation to reclaim these lands
those who do not own any swamp land . will
take very much such views as I have ex
pressed, namely, that all lands purchased for
$1 per acre as "swamps and overflowed lands"
should be assessed equally, If : necessary, to
reclaim all bo purchased, rather .to lay any
very important burden upon property not di
rectly benefited by the expenditure. If : those
who hold hand under this title recognize the
obligation assumed when they purchased I am
equally confident they will be met>by the peo
ple of the State In the most generous spirit,

also believe that there are certain obligations

PARIS, May 24.â The Council of Min
isters has considered the Vatican con
troversy and in an official note says:
"The Government is satisfied with
the authenticity of the reported protest
sent by the Vatican to the powers, and
therefore has decided to recall M. Ni
sard, leaving the- routine business to
the third secretaiy in the Vatican em
bassy."
The Government has fully decided to
present the Vatican controversy, cul
minating in the recall of M. Nisard. to
the Chamber of Deputies. A violent de
bate is expected and the Government Is
preparing itself for more radical action
than that heretofore taken, since it is
anticipated that an effort will be made
to abolish the French embassy to the
Holy See. Foreign Minister, Delcasse
will present the diplomatic negotia
tions with the Vatican, and Premier
Combes will set forth the attitude and
intentions of the Government. The of
ficials express the belief that the em
bassy will not be suppressed, but they
say, the Dresent feeling may lead to
that result when the appropriation for
sustaining the embassy comes before
the Chamber a month hence, at which
time the budget for foreign affairs will
be considered. But some parliamentary
elements are seeking the immediate
consideration of the matter, with a
view oÂ£ abolishing the embassy.
Members of the diplomatic corps say
it is definitely settled that the protest
to which France took exception was ad
dressed, by the Vatican to Spain. This
was the only protest containing the
clause intimating that the papal nuncio
would be withdrawn if other anA^simi
lar visits were made to King Victor i
Emmanuel. j
Apparently there is good warrant for
the belief that General Kuropatkin has
a strong line expending south from
Liaoyang and west of Haicheng pro
tecting an advance upon Kaichou and
Newchwang.
A direct attack upon General Kuro
patkin's main force apparently is not
considered to be impending. Nothing
more than outpost affairs are expected,
although some of these may be san
guinary. The Russian scouts are keep
ing in constant touch with the enemy,
and thus far the minor shiftings of the
enemy's detachments west of the Ta
yang River and northward of Moiting
ling are considered to be in the nature
of screens. If the two armies of . the
Russian commander in chief are trying
to work a force around in the rear of
General Kuroki or are planning a sur
prise, of course the fact is sedulously
concealed here. Uneasiness is displayed
at the near approach of the rainy
season, which will retard if not com
pletely stop field operations, although
this is playing directly into the Rus
sian hands.
The Russians will continue to hold
Newchwarig, Kaichou and Tashichou
until a move in force is made toward
Haicheng with the object of cutting off
the retirement of the force at Kaichou,
which Is sufficient to stand off an or
dinary force of the enemy and dis

ST. PETERSBURG, May 24.â The
prevailing opinion at the headquarters
of the general staff is that the with

decided to devote himself to operations
against Port Arthur, and that the pres
ent object of General Kuroki with the
first army, supported by General
Nadya with the third army, now land-
Ing near Takushan, is to watch Gen
eral Kuropatkin and prevent a move
southward, which would take Oku and

ers. One volunteer was killed.
The following dispatch from General
Kuropatkin to the Emperor, dated
May 23, was received .to-day:
"Our cavalry outposts on May 22 and
23 observed a movement of a portion of
the Japanese forces westwardly along
the Haicheng road, six miles from
FeYigwangcheng.
"On May 21 a Japanese detachment,
consisting of six companies of in
fantry and three squadrons of cavalry,
attacked some Cossack.-; en the heights
on the right bank of the Sedezi River,
near the village of Pootteikha, When
the engagement began the Japanese
cavalry remained under cover and the
infantry, which declined to cross the
valley, maintained a distant and al
most harmless fire, without sparing
ammunition. A small party, unsup
ported, tried to cross the river for the
purpose of turning our left flank, but
was driven back by the charge of Cos
sacks and the fire from the heights.
Toward evening the Japanese retired.
Our losses were ten Cossacks wound
ed."
The optimistic sentiment which gains
grc-und is reflected on the Bourse here,
where four per cents have risen to

ST. PETERSBURG, May 24.âExpec
tation is running high in St. Peters
burg. According to the latest news.i
General Oku's army, which has receiv
ed fresh reinforcements, is marching
toward Port Arthur,' where General
Fook is instructed to offer the utmost
resistance. At the same time, it is
known that General Kuroki ha3 been
daily strengthening his extensive lines,
which he found too weak to face the
Russian forces. General Kuroki's army
will soon be sufficiently reinforced to
give battle, as fresh, forces are con
stantly arriving. Military experts es
timate Japanese strength west of the

President was presented with a hand
some lot of flowers by the Brother

train then left for Poughkeepsie. At
various stations along the route from
Grpton the train stopped and the
President made brief addresses to the
assembled citizens.
"Boys and men," he said, "possessing
such qualities -will not be snobs. There
are in social and civil life worse crea
tures than snobs, but no creature is
more contemptible."
The President alluded to the athletics
of modern school life, saying that he
believed in athletics and sports and in
the spirit which was back of them. He
also referred to the advantages of
training in public schools, which train
ing he believed to be most beneficial
because of the democracy of the Insti

daybreak to-day the citizens assembled
to greet him.
In his remarks to the students the
President said that if a boy had not
pluck, common sense and decency he
was a pretty bad sort, and a man with
out these qualities was even worse. He
admonished them that they must not
in any degree become "prigs," and
urged them to be strong, to be decent

Prior to the Temple Company agree
"n*pr.t Simpson & Watkins, said Baer,
*>pPrated the mines on lease. The
jnjne? were owned, the witness thought,
'iff the raiiroads that tarried the coal.
.The Temple Iron Company directly
sells no coal except locally at the mines,
the witness said. The coal was brought
.t"6. tidewater by the railroads connect
ing with the collieries.
' Baer could not recall the price of coal
>Â»er tofc for mining. He said the cost
.varied from month to month and year
"lo year, but had been higher since the
strike commission decision thtan before
that time. Meanwhile bituminous prices
.had decreased, he said, and anthracite
"prices had been reduced to meet them.
-Farmer President Walter of the Le
high Valley Coal Company was called
'to the stand. Walter said he was pres
ident of the Lehigh Valley Coal Com
pany while he was president of the rail
road company. For tidewater coal the
railroad paid the coal company from 50
*to â¬5 per cent of tidewater prices. The
coal companies* production cost was on
a basis of CO per cent to the miner and
40' per cent to the company, the witness
fcaid. and in 1901 the proportion was
changed to â¬5 and Z7> per cent.
" Shearn sought to show i>y the wit
ness that the Lehigh Valley road re
bated to the Lehigh Valley Coal Com
*pany and practically greatly reduced
the carrying rate, but Walter's memory
â¢was a blank as to details. He made
the assertion that the coal company
paid the published tariff rates. Shearn
asked if it was not true that if the
published rates were paid the Lehigh
Valley Coal Company would lose mon
?y. - Walter answered affirmatively and
said that the coal company borrowed
from the railroad company.
â¢' Baer was recalled late in the after
â¢ noon.
/.''On a four per cent basis the Read
*ing ought to make f 5,000.000 a year."
said Baer. "and until it does reach that
â¢figtfie I will not agree that the price
' of coal is too high."
He said in answer to Commissioner
Prouty that reduction in freight tariff
would not necessarily mean lower
prir-es for coal to the consumer if the
operators thought they should get mere
for their product. The allegation that
the carriers purposelv tied up coal
ttaffic in winter or failed to furnish
cars to collieries has no foundation in
.fact, said Baer. There was freight
<-nncestic-n last winter to a degree not
known ir. many years and it was due
to physical conditions.
He continued:
Eaer was asked to produce the con
tracts between the Temple Iron Com
pany and Simpson & Watkins of
Scranton. Pa., dated February 27. 1895.
This* the witness did. together with cop
ios of other contracts. The copies were
Jiled as evidence.
In its decision the Supreme Court di
xected that E. B. Thomas, president of
the Lehigh Valley Company, and W. H.
Truetdale Df the Delaware and Lacka
\va::na answer questions regarding the
fixing of coal rate? at tidewater, trans
portation to tidewater and the manner
ot preparing price circulars. The deci
sion also compels the Temple Iron Com
pany and other operating companies to
produce in open court their contracts
with the carriers.
NEW YORK. May 24.â The Interstate

FINE BUILDING PROPOSED.
Finally, there is the division of pub
lication, which gives out with a lib-/
eral. hand the information secured
through the experiments of the bu
reaus and divisions, as well as the
army of agents at home and abroad.
George William Hill is the chief. He
compiles the Year Book, edits the re
ports and send* out the farmers' bul
letins.
The importance of a department or
the Government devoted to the fur
thering of "the interests of agriculture
was recognized by Washington, who, J
as Presldent/suggested it. The first j
appropriation for this purpose was
made in 1S39 and amounted to $1000
for the distribution of seeds. An in
dependent department was created in
1862. with Isaac Newton the first Com- j
missioner. The department was
raised to the first rank in the execu
tive branch in 18S8, during the term
of Commissioner Norman J. Colman,
who less than a month after being ap
pointed Secretary, was succeeded by
Hon. Jeremiah M. Ryak. There have
been but two successors to the office.
Hen. J. Sterling Morton, 1893-1S97, and
the incumbent, Hon. James Wilson.
From a room in the patent office in
18C2 to the proposed big but said to be
inadequate buidling in 1904 is an index
to the growth of the department for
the future as well as the past. The
building is to be located just'back of
the present building and out of the
line of Senator Newlands' vista 900 feet
wide from the Capitol to the monument
across the* mall. This vista is another
idea of Washington's, at this late day
being carried out by the Newlands bill
to allow no building within its limits.
The arbitrarv lines, seeing that no
other adeauate site has been provided
for the big department building, are
proving rather embarrassing to its
projectors, for it throws the struc
ture close out against B street, with
no room to grow additions and wings,
and the prediction is made that about
the time it Is to be occupied there [
will be need of still renting- the houses
across the street.
The building will comprise three
structures, ' two laboratories flanking
the central executive building, but
joined to it by covered curtains and
corridors. The executive building Is
to me (monumental in character and
square, extending front and back be
yond the line of the laboratories, which
extend' from it 256 feet each way, thus
giving to the building the form of a
cross. The material will be marble or
white granite and, completed, will form
one of the most imposing structures
in the city, a proper token of the im
portance and dignity of the great In
dustry in the interest- of which it is
builded.
A special foreign agent reports upon
these crops in other countries. He es
timates also the number and kind and
condition of animals on the farms and
ranches of the United States. He sends
his reports out by telegraph and by
poster through the mail for the in
formation of the farmer and others in
terested.
An important division of this bureau
is that of foreign markets. It works
to the end that the export trade in ag
ricultural products may be extended.
It gathers information as to the status
of supply and demand throughout the
world and distributes the same. Chief
of the bureau is John Hyde. Chief of
the division of foreign markets is
George K. Holmes.
Then there is the office of experi
ment stations, of which A. C. True is
director, and the j experiment stations
themselves in Alaska, Hawaii, Porto
Rico and several in the United States.
The office maintains relations with in
stitutions for agricultural education
and research throughout the United
States and aids in the formation of
farmers' Institutes. The office is very
effective in that it takes the initiation
along interesting lines. It publishes
the Experiment Station Record, com
prising abstracts of the bulletins and
annual reports of the experiment sta
tions of the United States. Irrigation
investigation and nutrition investiga
tion are conducted by this office.
There is the office of public road in
quiries, of which Martin Dodge is di
rector. It prosecutes inquiries touch
ing the making and management of
systems of roads and conducts experi
ments.

BULLETINS ARE WELCOME.
CALL BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON, May 24.â Stakes have
been driven in the mallâ that stretch of
green extending a mile west from the
Capitol-*-for the new home of the De
partment of Agriculture. It is to be a
beautiful home, although it will cost
just $1,000,000 short of what Secretary
Wilson asked Congress to spend upon
it. Secretary Wilson is therefore not at
all satisfied with it, although confess
ing that it is a vast improvement upon
the present housing of the department.
That is not much of a concession, how
ever, for it can hardly be said that the
department is housed at all â it is
stowed away in a dozen haphazard
places, more or less distant and inac
cessible from the central building, most
of which is rented and few of which
were remotely designed for its use. The
museum of the department, the de
struction of which would be a great
loss, is In an old ramshackle wooden
building. Many of the bureaus are quite
as poorly disposed; some of them are
broken up through not being able to
get all their members into the one
building provided.
So that to say the proposed structure
improves this condition suggests the
question as to how much. It will bring
the many bureaus that are now em
braced by the department into compact
groups about the executive building,
but it will not leave them much room
to expand. And that is the difficulty.
For this department is one of rapid
expansion, and there is no limit under
the law by which it was created, ex
cept, of course, the annual appropria
tion. And the chances are that as Con
gress is educated to the good works of
this department year by year, so, year
by year, will it raise the denomination
of the treasury warrant as the Secre
tary may desire. And not the depart
ment itself will work upon Congress to
this end as will the farmers of the
country.
stance, in England and Germany. This
bureau maintains a special dairy di
vision which not only gathers and dis
tributes information, but maintains a
system of inspection. It also main
tains an experiment station. The chief
of the. bureau is D. E. Salmon.. .
The Bureau of Plant Industry
studies plant life in all its relations to
agriculture. It has charge of the ex
perimental and test gardens and sta
tions; it searches the world for new
plants and seeds and distributes vast
quantities over the country without
charge. This bureau is the one that,
perhaps, gets closer than any other
to the agricultural community and its
work is of the most far-reaching im
portance. The chief of the bureau is
Dr. Beverly T. Galloway.
The Bureau of Forestry was allowed
by Congress in 1899â just five years
ago â the sum of $28,520. For this
year its provision is $350,000, which is
a sign of the expansion of this par
ticular branch of the department.
The bureau stands between the for
ests and the lumber men for both of
their sakes and for the sake of agri
culture and other interests as well. It
labors for the conservative lumbering
of the forests, it studies commercial
ly valuable trees, takes measures to
protect the forests against fire and
gives practical assistance to tree plant
ers. The importance of the work is
shown in the recent creation of the
bureau from a "division" of another
bureau and in the large funds al
lowed it.
GREAT WORK BEING DONE.
Dr. Harvey W. Wiley has been with
the Agricultural r X>eparJ.ment for
twenty-one years. He was conducting
experiments and making analyses
years before there was any Bureau of
Chemistry, but now he is at the head
of such a department and 120 men
are employed in its service. He can
remember when J 15,000 was gracious
ly alowed by Congress for the Agricul
tural Department and this year he was
granted $50,000 for his department.
The bureau is one of the oldest in the
department, having been organized
with its establishment in 1862. It di
rects its attention to the investiga
tion of soils, fertilizers and irrigation
waters, insecticides, foods of men and
animals, quality of materials used in
road construction, inspection of ex
port and import food products. This
terse statement covers a wide field of
experiments. There is a food labora
tory, a special sugar laboratory, a
dairy laboratory, a road material
laboratory, soil and fertilizer labora
tory, Insecticide and agricultural
water laboratory, drug laboratory,
contracts laboratory. The bureau co
operates with the Association of Of
ficial Agricultural Chemists, with the
experiment stations and also with
other departments of the Government.
There is the bureau of soils, charged
with the study of soils in their rela
tion to practical agriculture. The great
work of this bureau is the classi
fication and mapping of soils in ag
ricultural regions throughout the
country, showing the distribution of
the various soil types with a view to
determining their adaptability to cer
tain crops and their management and
treatment. This is an immense con
tract, but is being steadily prosecuted
with excellent and valuable results.
The work has been carried on in thir
ty-four States and Territories. Of the
area covered In the several States.
North Carolina leads the list accord
ing to the latest report, with 464G
square miles, California following with
3921.
An investigation is also carried on
as to the materials and methods in
volved in artificial fertilization and
its influence upon the original soils.
Extensive investigations have been
and are still being carried on with re
gard to the alkali problem. Milton
Whitney is chief of the bureau.
SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF PESTS.
The study of insects affecting field
crops, orchards, forests, etc., and in
sects in relation to diseases of man
and other animals in all the wide ap
plication of the term Is under the di
vision of entomology, L. O. Howard
chief. The work, of course, is directed
at a cure in every- case. The division
has been having a long and expensive
contest with the cotton-boll weevil,
for which Congress appropriated $258,
000, and despite which the pest still
remains in devastating activity in the
cotton belt. That a cure will be ulti
mately discovered and applied, how
ever, under this patient, persistent and
comprehensive Government system of
investigation as it could not be by pri
vate and sporadic attempts, there ?can
be no doubt. It was this division that
dispatched C. L. Marlatt to China,
who brought back with him several
colonies of the ladybird proving so ef
fective against the San Jose scale and
which brought also the flg fertilizing
insect from Smyrna.
The division of biological survey
studies the geographical . distribution
of animals and plants and maps the
natural life zones of the country. It
encourages the - preservation of the
beneficial and the destruction of . the
injurious species. C. Hart Merriam Is
chief of the division. ' :
The bureau of statistics is an im
portant one. The statistician, through
the agency' of about 250,000 correspond
ents, collects statistics and makes es
timates concerning the products of ag
riculture. He figures up the area sown
to all the leading crops and through
the growing- season collects \ and pub
lishes statements as to their- condition.
The work of the department is di
vided uo among various bureaus, di
visions and offices, each with its chief
and corps of experts. First there is
the weather bureau, the work of which
is most familiar to all the people. The
work of this bureau was one of the
first undertakings of the department.
It was inaugurated by the first Com
missioner of Agriculture, Isaac New
ton, while the present department of
the Government was a mere division
of the patent office. It was at first
given over to the War Department,
subsequently taken back by the Ag
ricultural Department, again handed
back to the War Department and final
ly, thirty years after Commissioner
Newton's suggestion, developed into a
full-fledged bureau, with Willis L.
Moore its present chief. The bureau
maintains stations throughout the
United States and West Indies, 180 in
number, and from their reports fore
casts are made up covering forty-eight
hours and these are published broad
cast. Through an arrangement with
those Governments advices , are re
ceived from Mexico and Canada, the
Azores and also along the Western
coast of Europe. This bureau also
keeps advised through similar stations
numbering nearlv 300 as to the condi
tion of the rivers, and foretells floods.
It gathers statistics on climate and
the condition of the crops and dis
tributes the information and is con
stantly experimenting within and ex
tending the lines of its province.
,The bureau of animal industry in
vestigates the problems "and difficul
ties that beset the live stock indus
try. It fights disease in a compre
hensive and scientific way, inspects the
stock living and the -food products
when entering into interstate and ex
port commerce and bas' been instru

RISE OF A DEPARTMENT.
essential part of their business. Any
thing the Agricultural Department
wants they think it ought to have. And
seeing that there are some six and a
half million farms in this country,
what the farmers, when they get to
gether, say is very likely to "go."
The appropriation ipr the work of
the department is less than one per
cent of the sum of the annual appro
priations, less than one dollar per farm,
less than the cost of one battleship. It
is the only department that turns
money into the pocket of the Govern
ment. Under this condition the farmer
is dispc-sed to say to the Congress, "let
our department do all the good it can."
As an illustration of the expanding
power of the department the multipli
cation of its members or employes will
serve. When Secretary Wilson took
charge seven years ago the census of
the department totaled 1900. To-day it
is 4100â considerably more than doubl
ed. And the increase during the last
two years is above that of the pre
ceding five years. This explains the
labels on the residences and barns all
about the neighborhood as showing
them to be in the service of the de
partment and accounts as well for the
anxiety of the Secretary as to the ade
quacy of the new building. He would
build for the future a little, taking into
account that when the present build
ing was constructed only thirty-six
years ago it was deemed all sufficient.
There are more department workers
outside of that building now than in.
And why this expansion? The law
creating the department defines its
"designs and duties" to be "to acquire
and to diffuse among the people of the
United States useful information on
subjects connected with agriculture in
the most general and comprehensive
sense of the word." By this leave the
Secretary may go into merchandising
if he chose as did Secretary Rusk when
he introduced cornmeal into Europe
and Secretary Wilson when he sent
American dairy products to London to
test the conditions under which they
might enter into competition with
European goods. He can explore the
earth's surface to discover if it have
in any hidden or remote place any de
sirable plant that might be grown to
advantage in some section of our own
diversified soil or climate, or if there
be any art or Insect of plant that
might combat the ailments of our na
tive products. By this right he has
discovered and brought here the won
derful fertilizing insect by which the
growing of Smyrna and Capri figs is
broueht to perfection in California;
dates~ have been brought from Persia
and Africa that have made themselves
at home in California, new strains of
rice from Japan have been domesticat
ed in Louisiana and Texas, Sumatra's
tobacco is made to grow in Connecti
cut, and macaroni wheat is found to
thrive when transplanted in the semi
arid regions of the Northwest; insects
have been brought from far South
Africa and beetles from China and
Japan that have been set to destroy
the destroyers of our fruit trees. Every
foot of soil in the whole country is be
ins tested and mapped, showing its
needs or its best capabilities: the
farmer is being met individually and
in groups and "shown how." educated,
taught his own best capabilities; the
young are being interested in agricul
tural pursuits; farmers are not only
shown the necessity and great advan
tage of Â£ood roads, but the Secretary
undertakes to show the experts how
the best roads may be made better.
All these things he does and a great
many others and still a great many
others he is going to do when he gets
round to it.

The Judiciary committee made a
special report late to-day upon the
question as to whether the Philippine
field could be treated as '"foreign ter
ritory" with reference to the mission
ary Bishop situation. Th*Â» judiciary
< oinmittee decided that it might be so
treated. It is possible that the episco
pacy committee will recommend a mis
sionary Bishop for this field, but
ecareeiy rirobable at this late stage of
the conference.
There was very little interest in the
â¢â¢lection of editors, as the field had
been" thoroughly canvassed by the re-
candidates and in most cases
there was but one nomination for each
office. The Southwestern Christian
Advocate, published at New Orleans,
furnished tne only contest and it took
two ballots to elect R. E. Jones to the
editorship of that publication. Other
editors named are: Methodist Review,
\Y. V. Kelly; Christian Advocate. J. M.
Buckley, New York; Western Christian
Advocate, LÂ«vi Gilbert; Northwestern
Christian Advocate, D. D. Thompson;
'Central Christian Advocate, C. B.
Spencer: Pittsburg Christian Advocate,

Christian Apologist. A. J. Nast. and
Editor of Haus and Herd, Frederick

There was a warm and prolonged de
bate agair.st the fixing of Philadelphia
as the place of residence of a member
Â«>f "the Episcopal Board, as was also
the case in regard to Cincinnati. There
Â¦was" a strong effort made to substitute
Fort Worth for Philadelphia and when
this failed the champions of the Texas
city sought to have it substituted in
place of Buenos Ayres. Both failed,
hcrwever, aVid in the end the report of
the episcopacy committee was adopted
\rithout change. The places adopted
are as follows: New York. Boston,
Philadelphia. Nashville. Buffalo. Cin
cinnati, Chattanooga. St. Louis, Chi

Buenos Ayres an,d Shanghai. The
episcopacy committee will report to

LOS ANGELES. May 24.â The Meth

until Â£ p. m.. with a brief adjournment
at noon for luncheon. The greater part
of the day was taken up in speech
making, incident to fixing the places
of episcopal residences.

ARRIVE IN STOCKTON
Â¦ Captain Russell said: "Yes, I saw,
the boat sink. It went down at exacts
ly 3:15, just about fifteen minutes after,
it struck. We had no available boats
here, yet several of my guards volun~
tered to go put in a rowboat. We were,
about to start out, when we saw that
the life boats had left the vessel : and
headed the other way. If we had. had
a launch here we could have reached
the vessel soon after it struck.'"
The'Oil tank schooner Alton was
built in Stockton in 1900, is of 109 tons
register and valued at- $10,000. The fol
lowing were the'men on the Ill-fated
steamer: Captain, J. J. Denny;' engK

John Ryan ; firemen, Floyd and - Kep

Japanese named Charles Okara. .
these same boats turned their course in
the direction of Point Richmond. Those
at San Quentin who witnessed the ca
tastrophe say the boat struck at 3
o'clock and within fifteen minutes was
out of sight. Guard F. B. MoHilton was
the first to notice the vessel.
In an interview he said: "I noticed
the boat as early as 2 o'clock. What
first attracted my attention to it was
that it seemed to be headed this way.
I knew there was no vessel due at San
Quentin and watched it. In a short
time the course was changed, heading
toward Point Richmond. In a few min- r
utes her nose pointed to us again. It
kept up this tacking for fully an hour.'
When it was just near 'The Hen and
Chickens Reef I saw it list to one side
and then swing around. It steadied it - r
self again. A while after a flag was
hoisted. I had notified Captain Rus
sell and he was preparing to go to the;
rescue. I could not see. the name of.
the vessel. I could see quite a number
of people on the top of the vessel, but
could not tell whether there were any
women on board or not." â¢ Â¦

When everything was in readiness to
start the guards in the watch tower re
ported the vessel had gone down . and
that two lifeboats were seen putting
oft in the direction of Red Rock. Later
crew of the boat hoisted a distress flaK.
Captain Russell immediately looked
about for means to go to the assistance
of those on board. There were only
two small rowboats at the prison
wharf, and even though there was a
heavy gale blowing two of the guards
volunteered to row out to the vessel,

tween 3 and 4 o'clock this afternoon
in Pedley's Dam, a mile northeast of
Corona. f
Four little boys left^for the dam
early in the afternoon, and while play
ing on an improvised raft fell into the
water. Two of them reached the bank,
the others losing their lives. The two
boys who were left notified a teamster
in the employ of the San Jacinto Land
Company of the occurrence, but the
man paid no â¢ particular attention,
thinking it a joke. The boys then re
turned to town so badly frightened that
they said nothing about the matter. As
two of Pedley's men were en route for
town this evening they thought they
would jso to the dam and see if there
was any truth in the boys 1 story. They
discovered the little fellows' clothes on

WESTON, Or., May 24.â His clothing
stained a sickly yellow and redolent of
the odor of stale eggs, President Robert
C. French dodged across the campus
of the Eastern Oregon State Normal
School a night or: two since in an ef
fort to conceal an unpleasant-adven
ture with a number of men supposed
to be employes of the Weston brick
yard.
The effort at secrecy failed and the
story leaked out. At a faculty meeting
one of tne women teachers charged
President French with making unkind
remarks about her keeping company
with a young man employed in the.
brickyard. "No one but hoboes work
in a brickyard," was the unkind retort.
This slur was quickly repeated to the
one interested, and the fusillade of bad
eggs followed at the first opop^tunity.
Other matters have caused dis
coTd among the members of the^ fac
ulty, and the people of, Weston arc
taking active sides. It. is alleged that
the attentions of Professor Cheesmon,
a youthful Instructor, to a teacher have
aroused the ire of the president. Chees
mon is supposed to.be engaged to the
sister of the president. The sister is a
resident of a* valley town, and Chees
mon's friends say his show of affection
to the Weston lady is purely platonlc.

Several of the officers and guards at
Ban Quentin prison witnessed the sink
ing of the steamer and were first to re
port the vessel in distress. One of the
iruards first saw It and reported it
to Captain Russell. Shortly after the
SEEN AT SAN QUENTIN.
For three-quarters of a mile east of
the Fan Pablo dock the shore was coat
od with crude oil and wreckage from
the foundered steamer. Nowhere,
however, could anything be found bear
ing the name of the ill-fated vessel.
William Varley, an employe on the
"dock, thought the steamer intended to
, tie up there, and as she swung around
in*uch an erratic manner he watched
her heading across the ship channel.
When about a mile from shore she
again ehangred her course and ap
peared to be pitching badly. Though
the wisd was blowing a gale there was
considerable haze on the bay, and the
last Varley saw of her she appeared
â¢ro be sinking by the head and had con
siderable list to rtort.
â¢John Foley. also an employe on the
dock, had his attention called to the pe
culiar actions of the steamer when she
approached the landing. He said:
"It looked to me as if the Alton in
tended to tie up at the dock, but in
stead cf that she simply butted in and
then headed out into the channel. Her
great tanks stuck high into the air,
Â¦while the hull appeared to be very low
in the water. I watched her until Ehe
grot, out of sight in the haze, and just
as she disappeared I thought she had
gone down." '
L. Palrr.tag, engineer at the San
Pablo dock, tells the same story as the
other employes regarding the steam
er's disappearance, but adds that she
appeared to turn around and change
her course three or four times, as if her
steering gear had been damaged and
nil control of her headway lost.
James McKenzie had noticed the ves
* sfl before she headed in toward the
dock and later as she started on her
fatal trip toward the San Quentin
shore. When the wreckage began to
drift into the little cove half a mile
cast of the dock he was one of the first
to Investigate such articles as came
tshore. Half of a valise was found
which had evidently belonged to
Claude E. Kepner, as a package of let
ters addressed to that name! care of
the steamer Alton, was found among
its contents.
According to eye-witnesses the steam
â¢ef, was headed for San Fran
cisco, appeared to become unmanage
â¢ able when near Point San Pablo dock,
f he was headed toward the San Quen
tin shore, but such a heavy sea was
running and the wind blowing with
Euch force that she made but little
progress.
Excitement was occasioned Â¦ along
the water front yesterday afternoon
by the report that one of the river
steamers with a heavy passenger list
had struck Red Rock in San Pablo Bay
Â¦ #nd pone down in a few moments with
nearly all on board.
Rumors flew fast and as the bay was
very rough great apprehension was
. .felt by people who had relatives and
.frler.ds aboard any of the steamers.
The first report *vvas to the effect that
ijje Stockton steamer Herald had been
-lost in the accident.
'There " appeared to be no way to
'. verify or deny this rumor, as many erf
â¢ ibe boatmen along the front declined
te -make the passage across Raccoon
"Straits on account of heavy seas.
Later Investigation developed the fact
'that it was the Pacific Ceast Oil Com
pany's steamer Alton, Captain James
J. -Denny, which had foundered near
Red Rock in San Pablo Bay at 3:30,
6ut without any loss of life.
John Escavera, one of the crew of
the Alton, stated there were seven men
on the steamer at the time of the
foundering and that all were saved.
His explanation of the foundering of
the steamer is as follows:
"We were coming down the bay emp
tj. The Jargre tanks, which carry about
25.000 gallons of oil, made her top-
Jieavy, and in the heavy sea she was
"strained so badly that she sprang a
leak. It was the intention to beach her
near San Pablo Point, but when we
reached there she became unmanage
â¢ able and we drifted with the tide to-
V - ard Rod Rock. Signals of distress
were raised, and just a few seconds be
lore she toppled over and went down
. we launched the lifeboat, and after an
hour's hard work succeeded in reaching
tki.e rhore near the town of Point Rich

Then she smiled.
The applause rumbled on and on,

The California delegation to the Re

travel from San Francisco to Chicago
on one of the best special trains ever
placed on the rail. It Is understood
that the Southern Pacific, Union Pacific
and Chicago and Northwestern manar
gers will see to it that no back number
Pullmans are put in. It is expected
that the train will be first class in
every detail and equal in all respects
to the cars provided for first-class spe

Already seventy passengers of the
required one hundred are listed for the
trip. Delegations fr/>m Nevada and

complement. Fulton G. Berry of Fres

several other well-known Californians
have reserved accommodations on the

SPLENDID TRAIN ASSURED.
To-day Senators Perkins and Bard
will exchange greetings. There is an
impression in political circles that the
senior Senator will preserve strict neu
trality in the event of an animated
contest between Senator Bard and Mr.
Oxnard, but the inference is denied that
the junior Senator, on the grounds of
reciprocity, will expect something more
favorable and inspiring from Senator
Perkins than cold neutrality.
Senator Bard brings encouraging re
ports concerning the enthusiasm and
unity in Republican ranks of the East.
He would not be surprised if the nomi
nation for Vice President should fall to
Mr. Hitt. l
The aspiration of Henry T. Oxnard
to serve California in the Uniied States
Senate were spoken of and reference
was made to the fact that Mr: Oxnard,
in New York, some time ago, made
known his purpose to enter the con
test and received from the Senator an
assurance that such candidacy would
not in any sense disturb their friendly
relations.
OXXARDS ASPIRATIONS.
The Senator says very frankly that
he would appreciate the honor of re
e.'ection to tha United States Senate
and would take pleasure in serving the
State for another term in Congress. He
maintains, however, that he is hot an
active candidate, preferring that the
people of California should decide them
selves, without direct solicitation on
his part, whether they desire his re
election to the Senate. He â¢ refers to
the correspondence published some time
ago regarding his attitude toward the
question of the Senatorship and admits
that several of his friends in the south
regret that he was not more explicit.
He feels, nevertheless, that his position
was fairly understood in Riverside,
where his candidacy was indorsed by
the convention.

"If you are willing to put a tonnage
tax on- all that goes to a foreign mar
ket, everything that goes out of the
country, even to new markets, I think
you would get the ships. That would
come out of the people.
"The ship subsidy started in about
thirty minutes. I had induced the
Japanese to take -our cotton to mix
with theirs so lhat it would make bet
ter yarn. The Boer war broke out
and we could not get ships on the
Pacific Coast. I had to cancel an
order for 60,000 bales in December.
I carhe East and saw Senator Fair
banks, and Senator Hanna. I asked
why -we could not get ships to- carry
our goods. Senator Hanna said he
would see me in the morning, and he
did. The result was that he opened
his campaign in. Ohio on the ship sub
sidy." .
"Then your remedy," asked McDer
mott, "is an export bounty?"
"Yes, that is it."
HILL IS PESSIMISTIC.
' "You seem to be very pessimistic
over the outlook." said Senator Gal
linger. /
"That is because I have looked at
it from a purely business standpoint.
I built those two ships simply as a
regulator to try the experiment.
"There are only two courses open
either an export bounty or Govern
ment assistance, which would rise
into very large figures."
"Then you are convinced that we
shall have to give some sort of Gov
ernment aid or go out of business?"
asked Senator Lodge.
"Exactly. If you fix a limit of ten
years on the subsidies the favored'
party must make the cost of his plant
in ten years. Otherwise he will sell
out to the other fellow."
"How much do you think would be
required for subsidy?" asked Senator
Mallory.
"Olv 510,000,000 or $15,000,000
would get a lot of tonnage. You might
take it out of the river and. harbor
bill.
"That Japanese line you speak of,"
asked Senator Lodge, "is very skill
fully subsidized, is it not?"
"I talked to Ito about this: he was
with me two or three days and is very
capable. If there is a bounty for the
line It is so skillfully covered up that I
was not able to discoVer it."
The hearing will continue Â¦ to-mor
row. Â¦'.' Â¦'":.'â¢ .--.Â¦ . r
In answer to a question of. Represen
tative McDermott, Hill said that his
two big ships cost 10 to 20 per cent
more to build here than abroad, add
ing:
"We have very few sailors, even on
pleasure ships. Go to Puget Soundâ
the heads of the unions are the board
ing-house keepers. A man who is dead
broke and broken down by excesses is
the man sent to us. Same way along
shore. You hire 200 men as stevedores,
good, competent men, and tell them to
come next day; they don't come as
"I don't think you will make much of
a success of buying merchant marine;
it won't stay with you. You must get
people interested, but there does not
seem to be much disposition on the
part of the people to go into shipping."
QUESTION OF SAILORS.
"We cannot comply with the regula
tions placed on us and compete with
ships of other nations. We have been
forced out.
"They can build ships in England
much cheaper than here. Citizens of
other countries have owned ships for
the last forty years to a greater extent
than we. v*
"I have had experience in building
two shipsâ the largest frieght carrying
vessels in the Worldâ and I don't want
any more.
"I would rather undertake to build
1000 miles of railroad than two ships.
It has taken four years instead of two.
"If we are going to buy a merchant
marine out of the treasury of the coun
try it won't last long. We must give
people confidence to invest.
"In Japan they have built up a large
marine; they have protected tonnage,
but I do not remember the details.
"Our business on the Pacific is hard;
we have to compete with all nations,
and they are fighting Arery hard tor the
Oriental trade. And I think that we
have placed obstructions in the way of
this trade.
A COSTLY EXPERIMENT.
NEW YORK, May 24.â James J. Hill,
president of the Northern Securities
Company and of the Great Northern
Railway, appeared this afternoon as a
witness before the Merchant Marine
Commission, the joint Congressional
commission which is investigating the
causes of the decline of American ship
ping in order to suggest measures for
remedial legislation.
"The first thing necessary," said Hill,
"is to create a desire in the people of
this country to own ships. It is a
purely commercial question. If there is
a profit in it people will engage in it;
if a loss, it is a question how long the
people will stick. Our conditions on the
high seas as a nation appear hard to
meet. On land, in spite of the high rates
of labor, the United States has been
able to work out a system without an
equal.
"Why we are not able to do this on
the high seas is not clear to me, and as
far as I have investigated it I believe
that no amount of direct bonuses will
build it into a life worth living.
"What the country wants is a mar
ket. Outside of our agricultural prod
ucts â cotton, grain and oil â there are
very few things we can export, be
cause the cost of production is so high.
We cannot sell them. If we would carry
those products in our own bottoms it
would be a source of great profit.

~. A|-HIN(JTON. May '23. â Opposing counsel
In the Tyner-liafrett cor.st'ira'cy case contln
ned 'arpftmiynts iefore Juc&e Pritchard in eup
pcrt of th* 1 pYayers they offered for the ln
â¢tructroS Â«f the Jury. The arguments will be
concluded to^norrow.
I know of nothing further the Mint people
can do In the matter. It rests, of course, with
Cuhne If he has been swindled to talk to the
police.
In many instances we accept bars condition
ally. Oftentimes they are so base that they
will not be received â that is to nay they will
run under 200 parts gold to 1000 parts. In
such caj-es we decline to accept them. They
lare too low for us to handle. Jlajor Noggle
liad little douht that the bar would be found
-worthleffl, but to be sure he had an assay
made. /
Strange as it may appear, there have been a
number of such cases at the Mint. On one oc
casion five email bars of purported gold were
sent to the Mint from one of the prominent
banks. The assay showed that there was not
a trace of preefcus metal in any one of them.
In the case to-day I see' nothing that would
concern the Mint. It appears that Cuhne is the
victim of sharpers. Major Noggle said the
men seemed confident when they presented
themselves in the mornln? and were completely
taken back when the truth was known.
In his report to Superintendent Leach
Major Noggle said he had made no in
quiry concerning the circumstances un
der which Cuhne obtained the brick.
That was the 'connection of the Mint
officials with the transaction. Superin
tendent Leach explained that he was
satisfied there had been no intention to
defraud the Government. But in pre
caution he had given the case in Secret
Service Agent Burns' hands in order to
make positive the assurance that noth
ing criminal had been intended.
Superintendent Leach said last night:
NOGGLE SUSPECTED BAR.
"I told you so," said the second man.
"You've been swindled." That was about
what he said. It cave me a distinct impres
sion that there had been a regular old-fash
lrned gold brick swindle put through and that
Cuhne was the victim.
When Cuhne returned with the other man I
told him what the assay showed and he turned
pale as he started in no unfeigned emotion of
surprise .
I suspected the bar was not genuine as soon
as I saw it. but I did not want to say so
fiatly until an assay bad been made. It
mlcht have been an extremely base bar. of
Euch penoentage of gold that we could take It.
After -giving Cuhne his receipt I told him
to return In the afternoon, when a report from
the assay der>artment would be ready. That
report showed there was not a trace of gold In
the bar.
It was at 10 o'clock yesterday morn
ing that two men entered the receiving
department. One of them staggered in
under the weight of the heavy bar that
he bore on his shoulder. The other man
was Cuhne, owner of the white man's
burden. Placing the bar on the counter
the bearer gave a sigh of relief. Cuhne
did the talking with Clerk Noggle and
explained that he desired to deposit the
bar. Â¦ The customary routine was fol
lowed, except that Noggle told Cuhne
he would give him only a temporary
receipt for the bar pending the making
of an assay. Major Noggle said:
The brick, as described by Major
Noggle, was a rough, blackened affair,
not gilded, but of brass, with the ap
pearance to an unpracticed eye of a
bar of alloyed gold. In size it was
large enough to have carried $25,000 in
gold, but not heavy enough to be pre
cious metal.
Cuhne was so utterly dazed by the
disclosure of the assay that he did not
wait to make explanations. He and his
companion simply departed after the
telltale expression of surprise.
According to the Mint officials there
was no attempt made to defraud the
Mint. Cuhne, said Superintendent
Leach, deposited his bar in good faith
and acted as if he fully expected to
realize. So far as his dealings with the
Mint were concerned they were regu
lar and pointed to nothing but -a
straight business transaction on his
part.
The pair took the worthless bar away
with them. Subsequently Superintend
ent F. A. Leach of the Mint advised
Secret Service Agent William J. Burns
of the peculiar transaction. The Mint
people are satisfied that Cuhne was
the victim of a "gold brick" deal and
probably was hard hit. Major Noggle
notified Superintendent Leach that the
bar if it had been genuine would have
been worth 525,000. As It is, the assay
showed it was absolutely worthless.
A SHATTERED HOPE.
United States Mint officials discovered
yesterday what appears to be a gigan
tic "gold brick" swindle, with L. E.
Cuhne of the Crossley building as the
victim. Cuhne took a large metal bar
to the Mint yesterday morning for de
posit. The experienced eyes of the re
ceiving clerk. Major D. L. Noggle, dis
cerned that the ingot had a suspicious
appearance. The doubts as to its genu
ineness were confirmed by an assay, not
a trace of precious metal being found.
When Cuhne was advised in the aft
ernoon as to the results of the assay he
staggered as if he had been shot. A
companion in excitement turned to the
man with the exclamation:
"I told you so. I told you that it was
a swindle."

ASHEVILLE. N. C. May 24.â All
efforts to find fourteen-year-old Mars
E. Wagar Jr., a son of Mars E. Wagar,
the Cleveland millionaire, who has
been ir.icsing for twelve days from the
A6heville school, have proved futile.
The boy's father and a nunfber of
detectives have been here, though
Wagar has gone back to Cleveland.
He brought several detectives with
him.
The boy was last Been on May IL
He was missed that evening and the
faculty of the Bchool instituted a
.search. His parents were notified and
"U'agar immediately came to Ashe
ville.
Young Wagar was of good moral
habits and popular In school. He was
_ dreamer and fond of literature of
adventure and travel. He was recently
reprimanded by a teacher for breaking
a school rule and this is advanced as
a possible reason for his disappear
ance. He came here last fall with the
late Senator Hanna's grandson.

peaceful civilization.
CALIFORXIANS ENTERTAINED.
The press delegation and I the Cali
fornia State Board of Trade excursion
have ceased to exist as sight-seeing
bodies and | the members have scatter
ed, each to return home as he wills.
Some have gone farther East, some
have returned to California and many
are still here. The California build
ing has been their headquarters, and
Commissioner Filcher has placed him
self at their, service as guide.. He has
conducted the visitors to all the Cal
ifornia exhibits and the principal dis
plays of the fair in general. There is
so much to see that it can only be
briefly skimmed over in a short tim*.
Some of . the Califomians now here
will return again In the fall.
Commissioners H. C. Rapp of Contra
Costa and Fred Buck of Solano have
returned home, their business calling
them away.
Woodlawn Gates of Los Angeles, who
is Senator 'Bard's secretary, and Dr.
Doremus and wife of Santa Barbara
were among this week's visitors.
ThÂ« representatives of the Sacra
mento Valley Development Association
are having some trouble in placing
the reproduction; of the great 'seal of
California, done in beans, that; was

C. W. Merritt, the commissioner from
Santa Barbara County, is receiving
consignments of excellent lemons and
pomelos from the Crocker-Sperry ranch
in his county. Potatoes thirteen inches
in length, and stock beets weighing
forty-five pounds attract many people
to Santa Barbara's exhibit.
California's forestry display was
given a high compliment the other day
by Mr. Elwes of the celebrated Kew
Gardens, in England. He especially
admired the specimens of polished red
wood burl.
Among the distinguished San Fran
ciscans at the fair is Boo Wan Hoy, a
highbinder of the Hop Sing Tong,/who
has several nicks in his hatchet, which
isn't used for cutting cherry trees, and
who about three months ago was ac
quitted, by outswearing the; prosecu
tion, of the charge of trying to slaugh
ter a Yin Sing Ting man in Waverly
place. Boo was walking about qui
etly enjoying the sights of the fair
when Detective Reynolds of San Fran
cisco said "Hello!" to him. â¢

Fresno contributes to the California
building grounds Ca'nary Island date
palms, blue palms and windmill palms,
all of the finest sort. The Los Angeles
Chamber of Commerce has provided a
fine collection of palms. R. M. Teague
of Dimas, Los Angeles County, supplied
orange trees, which may bear fruit here
if the severe winter has not chilled
their marrow, and Santa Barbara has
sent a number of small plants.
Stockton and San Joaquin County
have made a fine contribution. In this
collection are handsome palms and 200
varieties of house plants. The most
striking feature of the San Joaquin
contribution are specimens of the Span
ish bayonet, or variegated yucca. It is
doubtful whether the yucca will bloom
here.
Sacramento is to have the honor of
placing two pomolo or grape fruit
trees in front of the main entrance of
the Palace oX Agriculture. These trees
have just arrived and they still bear
some ripe fruit. They will furnish a
striking advertisement for the Sacra
mento Valley.
Wherever California palms, plants or
fruit trees are placed for ornament
they bear the California label, for all
to read. The central part of the Pal
ace of Horticulture, which is reserved
as a place for the weary to rest, is or
namented with five palms from the
Golden State, and the labels are read
by nearly every one who is attracted
by their beauty.
Commissioner Joplin of Orange
County is going to show the fair visit
ors what California is capable of in the
production of beets. He cannot procure
a 250*pour.d specimen, such as was
shown at Chicago, but he has sent on
for one weighing 150 pounds that has
been recommended to him. The lower
part of this he will put in a cube of
peat soil he has on exhibition. About
three feet of the agricultural specimen
will then project into the air and the
top will grow. This peat land produces
the finest celery and biggest beets
grown in Orange.
CITRUS FRUIT DISPLAY.
CALL BUREAU, WORLD'S FAIR,
ST. LOUIS, May 24.â Golden Gate Park,
the beautiful, whose charm has In
spired people from every part of the
globe, is doing its share to make Cali
fornia's display at the World's Fair a
success. It has contributed liberally of
its wealth of vegetation, and its contrf
bution has been used with fine effect
on the grounds of the California build
ing by George C. Roeding, who has in
charge the beautiflcation of these
grounds and the placing of California
trees, plants and shrubs that are used
in other places within the fair grounds
as decorations. ; ;
San Francisco's wqnderful park has
sent on a fine collection, and its com
missioners are receiving the praises of
the Califomians here for their gener
osity. The most interesting things in
the collection are a baby Sequoia gi
gantea (California' big tree) and three
baby Sequoia sempervirens (coast red
wood). The little big tree is eight feet
high and the others ten feet high. They
are of about ten years' growth. These
trees are very, interesting to Eastern
ers and foreigners who have heard of
the wonderful Mariposa grove and the
vast redwood forests of California.
There are a number of varieties of
Japanese fir and one California spruce
tree in the park collection; also speci
mens of the New Zealand flax, a strik
ing flowering plant of variegated col
ors; the Monterey and funeral cypress
and a large collection of delicate bam
boos. The park sends altogether 100
varieties of trees, shrubs and plants,
and they seem to be doing very well
in the Missouri spring.

numbed by the pain, Spinello let go his
hold and the train passed over both
legs. One leg. was cut off below the
Â«nee, the other above. Â«â¢
When he relinquished his hold and
fell to the ground he was fully 100 feet
from the spot where he attempted to
board the train. Dr. A. F. Glllihan
and Dr. Frank Carpenter were sum
moned and at once bound up the man
gled legs of the victim as he lay on
the sidewalk.
Mrs. Spinello was permitted to see
her husband before he was^Iaced in
the ambulance.
"You are all right, dearie," said the
brave woman." s
"Look- at my legs," replied the hus
band.
REMAINED .CONSCIOUS.
Professor Spinello did not lose con
sciousness throughout the entire or
deal. Mrs. Spinello waited in the of
fice of Juster & Baird while her hus
band's frightful injuries were dressed,
then helped to make him comfortable
in the ambulance of the East Bay
Sanitarium.

crushed and reduced to shapeless
masses of splintered bone and mangled
flesh, by the outbound 9 o'clock Key
Route train, this morning, at Berkeley
station. Mrs. Spinello was a witness to
each horrible incident of the brief and
sickening* catastrophe, but not for one
moment did she lose ner self-control.
It was only when her husband passed
away at East Bay Sanitarium- this aft
ernoon that she gave way to the great
tragedy that was so suddenly thrust
upon her.
Professor and Mrs. Spinello were hur
rying up Shattuck avenue, between
Allston way and Center street, when the
Key Route whistle blew. Bidding his
wife good-by the professor ran rapidly
to Center street, hoping"- to meet the
train before it had got too much speed.
Twice the unfortunate man, as." he
sped along, was warned that he could
not board the train. C. C. Juster,, of
the firm of Juster & Baird, as he saw
Spinello run past, shouted to him that
it was of no use, he could not make it.
As Professor. Spinello continued to run
Juster shouted another warning to him
not to attempt to Jump.
s WARNED SECOND TIME.
- 1 As the prof essorapproached the gate
way of the third coach the second
warning came from the ticket col
lector, who waved his hand, warning
him back. By this time the train had
attained such rapid speed that no one
of the many witnesses believed Spinello
would try to board it.
With a swift running leap, however,
he grasped the lower rod of the gate,
but his footing was insecure, and after

In the early days the Haywards Villa
was one of the resorts of the coast. It
was operated by Tony Oakes, one of
the best known bonifaces in California.
In those days Tony Oakes wanted no
"short orders." If there was terrapin
to be had he had it; if there was any
thing dainty in the market he had it;
but he charged accordingly. In the
days when the Comstock speculation
\Vas at its height Tony Oakes* Hay
wards Villa was one of the resorts of
the State. Anything could be had in
the shape of "cold bots and hot birds."
But the days of the electric railroad
and cheap fares came, and then the
Haywards Villa \ met its fate. G. G.
Frantz tried to make it go, but failed,
and he dropped out of sight, and now
the famous old resort has fallen under
the Sheriff's hammer.
The disappearance of Frantz is not
the least of the. mysteries that sur
rounded the place. Frantz was well
known in Alameda County. He ran the
Villa for a number of years, but one
day he converted into cash everything
he had and dropped out of sight. Not
a trace of him has been found, though
the police of the entire coast have been
notified. He disappeared as completely
as if the earth had swallowed him up,
and his wife was left in Hay wards to
straighten out his affairs. The result
of his disappearance was the sale to
day.
The old Hayward Villa was sold out
to-day. -The sale Avaa forced by J. J.
Dolan in a suit against G. G. Frantz.
and the amount realized was $491 50 for
the stock.

The trouble over the child arose when
Ira P. Clark, the father, wrote his
mother, Mrs. McBurnie, and told her
to take the child away from the woman.
A year ago Clark deserted her and
the child and is now in Vandalia, 111.
Since his absence Richard B. Xewell
has been Etaying at the home of Mrs.
Clark in Alameda, and an effort was
ma<?e to show that the moral surround
ings of tho child were not proper.
The ptepmother may be all rljrht. But In
this world we have to be judged by the things
we bay and do, and for a woman who. in the
absence of her husband, has quartered board
ers in her house and allowed men to hang
around at all hours of the day and night is
conduct that I deem reprehensible. Under the
circumstances I rhall not allow the child to
Ftay with the stepmother, but shall give tt to
tbe rrandiaotber. . : -
My attention has been celled to the girl her
self by attorney for Mrs. Clark as though she
were a paragon of alt lhat Is good. What I
have seen of her gives mÂ« a shudder. She has
sat in this room for two days with a smirk on
her face ready to tate notice of anything. In
the witness-stand RDe has conducted herself
with an assurance thar was the height of hood
luinlsm.
At the end of a lecture given by
Judge Greene this evening he took
Ethel May. Clark, a 15-year-old child,
'from her reputed stepmother, and gave
her into the custody of Mrs. Eliza Me-
Burnie, the grandmother.
The order ended a quarrel between
the women, and came at the end of a
trial which had taken up the court's
attention for several days.
In his summing up of the evidence
Judge Greene expressed himself with
regard to the bringing up of the chila,
and said:
I would cut off my rieht hand before I would
sign an order giving letters of guardianship to
the stepmother. It has been shown that this
child has been allowed to eo to the. Chutes and
other places of amusement with young men
much older than she. At her tender age I
view this with horror.

XEW YORK, May 24. â Within the
next thirty days the production of pig
iron will, it is stated by leading deal
ers here, be greatly curtailed at the
furnaces in all parts of the United
States. The proposed reduction,
which is not by united action, is va
riously estimated at 20 to 40 per cent
of the present output. The furnaces
to be most quickly affected are those
which have been in operation the
longest, as the new furnaces have
more modern machinery and equip
ment and can turn out iron at a lower
cost than their older competitors.
The production of pig iron during
1903 was 19,000,000 tons. Experts
assert that unless there is great im
provement in the near future the to
tal for the current year will not ex
ceed 14,000,000 tons. ;

BUFFALO. N. Y., May 24.â The work
of the Presbyterian General Conven
tion consisted of a consideration of
home missions, the report of the stand
ing committee being presented by Rev.
John F. Carson of Brooklyn, chair
man of the committee. The report
dwelt upon the desirability of the Pres
byterian church pursuing a more sys
tematic course in the matter of funds
for home missions and advocated a
union of efforts among the churches
to that end. The necessity of extend
ing home mission work was empha
sized with particular reference to
strengthening the work among the
Mormons. As part of the report Dr.
Carson stated that "we heartily com
mend the work of the Christian wo
men of all denominations in carrying
on so successful a campaign against
the iniquity of Mormonism.''
The afternoon session was devoted
to the report of the standing commit
tee on aid for colleges and a discus
sion of the subject of college educa
tion. A special meeting was held to
consider the effect of the war in the
Far East upon Christian missionary
work.
A matter of general interest to mem
bers of the Presbyterian church Is the
conclusion reached by the committee
appointed by the last General Assem
bly of the Presbyterians of the United
States to raise 512,000,000 with which
to endow colleges, especially the weak
er ones in the West. The report rec
ommends the union of the board of aid
for colleges and the endowment com
mittee under the name of "College
Board," and the removal of the head
quarters of the board from Chicago to
New York.

Mr. Deakin advised that Mr. Watson,
the leader of the Labor party In Parlia
ment, be entrusted with the task of
forming a new Ministry. The next day
at noon, at the request of Lord North
cote, Mr. Watson, after advising with
the" leaders of his party, called on his
Excellency and after some exchange of
views received his commission to form
a new administration.
Mr. Watson in an interview the next
evening said that everything was go-
Ing on as well as he hoped.
It is gathered from several sources
that -the probable composition of the
Ministry will be as follows:
On the morning followfng the division
the last meeting of the old government
was held. It was understood that Mr.
Deakin was authorized to tender the
resignations of his colleagues as well as
his own to the Governor General. Di
rectly after the meeting was concluded
he waited on Lord Northcote and hand
ed to his Excellency the resignations
of himself and his colleagues. They
were provisionally accepted, Â¦ with the
request that the Ministers would con
tinue in office until their successors
were appointed, which request was ac
ceded to.
The Government is responsible for the arbi
tration bill, which has been the fruitful parent
of the intolerable labor demands, and we now
know from Sir John Forrest exactly why the
Government brought it in, and what those
who voted to keeo the Government in power
were supporting. The fact that the situation
is such a tangled one only goes to offer fur
ther proof, If that were necessary, of the de
moralization reigning In Federal politics as
the result of this alliance between the Federal
Government and the Labor party. The bebt
way to break down that alliance or anything
resembling it in the future is to rank the
moderate and State Socialist sections of the
House in fair opposition to each other, ami
this Is one of the .possible results of a crisis
like the present. The process has been more
rapid than was expected when Mr. Fisher
moved his amendment. It was anticipated
then that the debate on the general proposition
it enunciated regarding civil servants and the
arbitration bill would be merely prefatory to
the debate and division on the amendment
threatened by Mr. Watson. But the tone of
the debate set aside that assumption. Rapidly,
as political events have a way of changing,
the nature of the proceedings underwent .1
transformation, and on Wednesday night it be
came apparent that, whatever the motive o.
the causes, the amendment first moved in the
bill was to be the decisive one. And so it In*
proved.
The Government's defeat was a foregone con
clusion from the first, and whether It was ar
rived at on Mr. Fisher's or on Mr. "Watson's
amendment may only be material in respect
of the course followed by Lord Xorthcote In
replacing his late advisers. The attitude of
Ministers and the whole drift of the debate
led up to the defeat of the, Government by 38
votes to 2J>. which is about the proportion
foreseen, allowing for the non-participation in
the debate of eight members, including the
Speaker. The break-up of the Cabinet-cum-
Labor compact was the real defeat of. the
Government, and the division merely carried
it into effect. But one result of last night's
division is to bring to' an end after an exist
ence of about three years the historic Min
istry which, under its two leaders, had the
double distinction of conducting the business
of the first Federal Parliament and of disap
pointing the legitimate expectations of Fed
eralists. It closes a chapter In our common
wealth's history which must be always mem
orable, but which Is unhappily disfigured by a
manifest disregard of its high constitutional
responsibility by our first Federal Ministry.
RESIGNATIONS NUMEROUS.
LABOR DEMANDS.
The result of the division In the House of
Representatives last night upon Mr. Fisher's
amendment for including ptate servants in
the purview of the Federal arbitration act
was the defeat of the Deakin government.
As members realized l>uer how close the
division was likely to be it seems to have
bfen accepted as an occasion when disguises
might be laid aside and the conventions of
politics disregarded. Hitherto there has been
a certain affectation of innocence of the fact
that the business proper to this Parliament
was delayed, or that there was any under
standing among certain members by virtue
of which a majority was secured to the <Jo\>
ernment on certain condition!", or that Min
isters were pandering to the Labor part^, or
that the arbitration act In particular was
anything oth<>r than a necessary and desired
corollary of federation. These were prevailing
pretences hitherto and members fell In with
them with all the artless guilelessness of the
companions of Alice in Wonderland. But the
determined attitude of the Labor party over its
airendmenU Introduced a touch of reality
which quite spoiled the idyllic play. Sir John
Forrest was one of those who were most suc
cessful in responding to the appeal to throw
off the mack of illusion and his contribution
to the debate was not only instructive as well
as amusing in itself, but a very striking con
firmation of all that the critics of the Mln
isterlal-cum-Labor alliance have been Baying
for months past. The Minister for Home
Affairs assured us frankly and plainly, to
takt one example, that Ministers put the
alteration and navigation bills in the fore
front of the work of the session â "to assist
the party that had assiated us." And this la
the very thing that It Is the main business
of the opposition In the Federal Parliament
to protest against and oppose to the utmost.
It was not necessary, as some of the speakers
last night seemed to think, to vote to bring
civil servants under the bill. All It had to do
in its leaderlpss condition in the present crisis
was to let the Ministerialists and the Labor
jisxty settle their quarrel over the spoils 'be
tween themselves. \
The New Zealand political situation,
which had been very threatening ever
since the assembling of the Federal
Parliament on March 2, became more
acute on the reassembling on April
13 after the Easter recess and reached
the crisis on April 21, when the Gov
ernment was defeated on an amend
ment to the Federal arbitration act by
a vote of 38 to 29. The Sydney Her
ald, commenting editorially on the

The Government and the civic authorities
would have failed in- the discharge \>f their
duty had they allowed Mr. Dowie the further
use of public buildings after his gratuitous
and gross insult of the sovereign. â¢ â¢ â¢
Mr. Dowie' s attack on the King consisted
not so much In what he said as in the manner
in which he alluded to the subject and the
impression which he sought to convey that
he was jn possession of facts. Practically the
speaker was guilty of sedition in his effort
to hold up the sovereign to ridicule and con
tempt, and if he made no profession of sanc
tity whatever, but was simply content to be
accounted a mere Mat ant stump orator actu
ated by a base motive, or a cheap Jack who
hid to Â«ay something outrageous in order to
attract a crowd which should contain some
Billy victims for his confidence tricks, the of
fense would then be serious.
When Christ comes back be will abolish all
other governments. King Edward will have to
take a back seat very low down. I don't
want to say a single disrespectful word, but
nobody can boast of King Edward's piety. No
body Imagines that he has any religion to
spare. You only hope that he has enough to
get into heaven when he dies, and that will
apparently be by the skin of his teeth. He
has never been renowned for his religion. (A
voice â "Leave the King alone.") It is of no
use you howling about that. I don't care If
he Is the King. I am standing In the place
where John the Baptist spoke, and If I get
any mora talk back I shall say more about
King Edward and not less. You cannot make
me shut up with that kind of talk. I am the
servant of God. John the Baptist did not care
for King Herod, and if you stir me up 1 don't
care. You hold your tongue.
The authorities at once, refused
"Elijah" further use of the Town Hall,
"where he had been holding meetings.
The Adelaide Register, commenting
on the Incident in an eaitorial, entitled
"The Rejected Prophet," said:
Late news . from Australia shows
John A. Dowie ran into a hornet's nest
in Sydney, Melbourne and other Aus
tralian cities. At Adelaide in particu
lar he excited public indignation on
April 25 by impugning the piety of
King Edward. His words In part were
as follows:
The success achieved Â¦ in the wine
industry along the Hunter River, N.
S. W., is encouraging others to em
bark therein and it is expected that
in time the country will be an ex
porter of good wines. The butter sea
son has been a long and rich one and
a large surplus will be exported to
London, though for some reasons
prices there are not entirely satisfac
tory to the producers. The" season so
far does not prevent the broadly fa
vorable aspect for wheat which, was
so striking at this time In 1903. Some
districts have had too much rain.
Commenting on the situation as above
developed the Sydney Herald of April
25 said:
The Goverrtor General's commission to Mr.
Watson to form a ministry gives us a new
point of departure in Federal politics. It Is
one which Is of the first Importance, and at a
Juncture like the present should ."In no wise
.be misconstrued or misunderstood, either by
ourselves or by cur critics, and more particu
larly by rur tinancial critics abroad. If we
were to take by Itself the fact that a labor
ministry is In process of formation to control
our Federal affairs the event would be tme of
special significance in commonwealth politics.
But that fact does not stand alone. It is a
detail .In the general political situation, and
if the friends of liberal-conservatism as op
posed to experimental state socialism, and
advised, .there is no reason why It should be
other than a temporary one. It marks a
stage which has to be passed if our Federal
politics arc to evolve from the low condition
to which the tactics of the first Federal Minis
try reduced them to something: higher and
better. The plain Issue before the country Just
now Is whether we are to have responsibility in
the management of our Federal affairs, or
whether the Government is to be carried on by
nominal Ministers obeying? the dictates of the
Labor party.
The new Premier, Mr. Watson, is
but 37 years of age, but his friends
accord him full ability to carry, out
the work before him.
One of the first matters to which
Mr. Watson will give attention after
the organization of the new \ Minis
try will be the Federal capital ques
tion. The commission has inspected
a number of the 'sites proposed and
so far Bombala and Delegate have
the lead over the others.
(The Governor-designate of Victoria,
Sir Reginald Talbot, was to arrive by
the R. M. S. Ramora on the 25th of
April and will be received with much
demonstration.
tained from Mr. Watson a statement
to the effect that he thought the allo
cation of offices given above would be
about the best that could be devised.
It has also been stated that the new
Ministers may ask for a month's ad
journment, instead of three weeks.

IN the midst of war's alarms and the trembling of the
world's greatest nations comes like a comic inter
lude the barking and snapping of Peru and Brazil
over a little piece of disputed territory away off some
where at the headwaters of the. Amazon. We read that
Peru has sent armies to Alto Yurua and Alto Purus;
that Brazil is rapidly assembling forces dignified by the
same title on the western boundary of her repubTic, and
that war to the knife is soon to be grim reality.
It seems that the same elusive needle in the haystack
that* has caused solemn threats of war, exchanges of
notes diplomatic and high conclaves between contract
ing powers in the heart of South America for the last
fifty yiears is again the fly in the ointment. The wooded
country, rich in rubber, that lies along the banks of the
Yurua and Purus rivers, tributaries of the upper Amazon,
and which constitutes the indeterminate state, of Acre,
has been the subject of s'eparate dispute between Brazil,
Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia and Peru since ~the first
Para gum was drawn irom the trees. There have been
conventions between Peru and Ecuador, Brazil and Bo
livia until now the contest has narrowed down to the
final grapple between Brazil and Peru.
Not only does all this moll and trouble have to do with
the' cornering df the rubber market, but the finer ques
tion .of open navigation of the Amazon is also to the
fore. The father of southern waters, is open to naviga
tion by ocean-going _ vessels throughout the whole
of Brazil and up to the flourishing Peruvian towns of
/Kauta and Iquitos in the state of Loreta. These-points
of departure, situated on navigable waterj though a com
fortable 2000 miles from the Atlantic, are, nevertheless,
the chief points of shipment for the crude rubber fr6m
,the interior forests and constitute a sore stitch in the
side of Brazil. By assiduous jockeying and shifting of
the balances Peru has succeeded in laying claim to them
as the outposts of her territory. Can Brazil only plant
her flag there, the Amazon, in so far as it is a navigable
stream, will be a closed Brazilian river. .

WHILE cruising in the offing at Port Arthur the
Japanese first-class battleship Hatsuse collided
with two Russian mines and sank within half an
hour. A month ago the first-class Russian battleship Pe
tropÂ«vlovsk struck a Japanese mine laid outside the harbor
at Port Arthur and turned turtle in two minutes. To this
grisly record of, sudden extinction are added the Russian
battleships Retvizan and Cesarevitch' and the "protected
cruiser Pallada, all seriously torpedoed by the Japanese
on the first night of the war, and the Russian Boyarin,
blown up by one of its own mines, and the tale of de
struction by these two terrible forces alone is complete
up to present time.
Not until the outbreak of hostilities in the Far East and
the strife that has waged both on land and sea since that
momentous first night at Port Arthur has the world real
ized to what deadly lengths of perfection the arts of war
have progressed. The modern torpedo-boat was used
for tKe first time by the Japanese against the Chinese
fleet at the mouth of the Yalu with "telling effect during
the war of ten years ago. In our own war with Spain
the .torpedo-boat and its complement, the destroyer, played
but an insignificant part, as the bleached bones of the
Furor and Pluton, sunk by the converted yacht Glouces
ter, attest. In the strife now waging, however, tfie dead
ly sea dart has proven itself to be an engine of destruc
tion more potent than the battleship. The hidden mine,
an important factor in naval warfare for the last fifty
years, has now demonstrated its capacity for'havoc more
conclusively than ever.
. On land and sea the Japanese are using the deadly ex
plosive recently invented by Professor Shimose, so rend-^
ing in'its force that a handful laid on an iron plate an
inch and , a half thick and exploded will drive entirely
through the^metal and scatter splinters broadcast. The

succeeded in getting a war balloon through the enemy's

in the air will not be an unexpected feature of the land
fighting around the beleaguered cifj* Thus, with tor

London's Oldest Church.
Horses are stabled in London's oldest
church, such is the unfashionable state
into which this holy edifice has fallen.
Most London visitors know Smlthfleld
and the venerable church of St. Bar
tholomew. This ancient pile once in
cluded a great priory and a hospital â
built nearly eight hundred years ago.
Its founder was Rahere, a witty cour
tier of Henry I, who, in his advancing
years, became a pious canon of St.
Paul's. . Rahere raised money for his
church by telling the story that St.
Bartholomew appeared to him in a
vision in Rome and bade him raise
the church, and pointed to the spot on
the marsh at Sralthfleld. At .the dis
solution of the monasteries by Henry
VIII the priory and the cloister were
abandoned. The citizens preserved the
hospital, which is flourishing in these
days. But of Rahere's old church only
the choir and the cloisters remain. All
that Is left has, thanks to the present
rector, been restored excepting the vrest
cloisters. Some Â£30,000 has been spent
on the pious work, but another Â£1500
is needed before the west cloisters, now
used as a stable, can be restored. The
old Norman arches are now bricked up,
but when the restoration work Is done,
as it doubtless will be, London will
have one of the most interesting groups
of ruins in England. The old church
where Sunday service is yet held has
seen the martyrdoms of Smithfield. the
death of Wat Tyler and the execution
oi the great Sir William "Wallace, and
in earlier centuries the tournaments of
Edward III and of Richard IL

A Reply to Dr. Bane,
To the Editor San Francisco Call-
Dear Sir: May I resent some state
ments made by one Rev. A. C. Bane
anent the wickedness of the stage and
published in your paper of May 23? I
think the statement that "no church
member would feel pride in having a
son or daughter keep company with
an actor or actress or even be
ing seen in public with them"
is unworthy any "man," much
less an alleged apostle of him
who said "He that is without sin cast
the first stone." My father is a clergy
man, who at present Is serving a splen
did people In a prominent church in
the East, and both he and they thor
oughly approve of my vocation. I am
fortunate in numbering among my best
friends members of the Methodist
clergy, four of whom are now at
tending the General Conference in Los
Angeles, but will be my guests "at the
California Theater" next week. Mr.
Bane attributes his present views to
his work as a reporter. Whv does he
not give the real reason? I would
suggest more brotherly love in his
heart, plenty of fresh air and sunshine
and a good digestion medicine. To my
mind the man who disgraced(?) the
Methodist . church by losing his life in
the Iroouois Theater fire was worthy
of more commendation than he who
condemns those who are earning their
living by honestly using the only talent
given them. Mr. Bane asserts that
Shakespeare was a libertine, but he
might well emulate him by finding
"sermons In stones (not by throwing
them) and good in everything." Very

The Four Fingers.
No better epitome of the late Henry
M. Stanley's career has been conceived
than that given by himself In his "story
of four fingers." On his return* from
finding Livingstone, he said, he had the
honor of a public reception by the
Royal Geographical Society, and the
especial honor of being presented "to
an exceedingly distinguished personage
In the scientific world." which regarded
him with condescending favor and even
went so far as to shake hands with
him. "He gave me." said Stanley, "one
finger!" After his second and third ad
ventures, his exploration of the lakes
and his opening of the Congo to civ
ilization, he was again publicly re
ceived, and this distinguished person
age regarded him with even more favor
than before. Again he shook hands
with him. "He gave me two fingers:"
Once more Stanley went to Africa, to
rescue the faithful Emln. and on his
return he was a third time publicly re
ceived. A third time the distinguished
personage condescended to smile upon
him, still more approvingly than be
fore, and a third time to offer him his
hand. "He gave me three fingers!" Yet
once more Stanley appeared in public,
with a fair companion. Miss Dorothy
Tennant, who a few months later was
Lady Stanley. There once more the
distinguished personage was present.
so far condescended as to- beam
upon him with unreserved approval.
"The throng was too great for me to
get near him," said Stanley, "but I
have no doubt that had I been able to
do so he would once more have of
fered me his hand, and on this occa
sion he would have given me all four
fingers!" In this tale were set forth,
perhaps with all-uneonscious frank
ness, the weakn?s?Â»3 as well as the
strength of his character, the changing
altitude of the great world toward him
and the steadfastness of his own soul.
When he concluded. "Gentlemen, the
story of those four fingers is thÂ» stcry
of mv life," the listener felt that he
knew him then as never before. â New
York Tribune.
THE compound, complex, comminuted fracture in
Democratic politics is exhibited in Ohio. The party
there is divided into Hearstlings and Conservatives.
But Buckeye conservatism is a different article from that
known by that name in New York. It means Tom
Johnsonjsm and its tenets are found written in the last
State platform on which Johnson ran for Governor. It
includes.. all the.creed of Populism and Bryanism and So
cialism: It demands government ownership and opera
tion of all public utilities, the substitution of direct leg
islation for representative government and the judiciary,
through the initiative and referendum, and free trade for
protection. .
Just why that kind of conservatism should oppose
Hearst is not explained. The Ohio 'Democracy does not
take kindly to Judge Parker nor Olney. It has part of a
soft side for ex-Attorney General Harmon, but seems to
prefer a favorite son in the person of Judge Kilbourne,
who is unknown to external fame. Johnson has a per
sonal choice in Mr. Polk of St. Louis. Polk is the young^
District Attorney, who found Democratic management in
Missouri so rotten that he became famous by sending a
job lot of his fellow Democrats to the penitentiary. , He
even hooted the Lieutenant Governor out of office.
The morality of the Missouri Democracy seems to
have been wrecked on legislation concerning alum in bak
ing powder. The question was of sufficient financial im
portance to warrant the Missouri mazuma in expending
large sums of money and the 'Statesmen fell in shoals.
Even United States Senator Stone was said to be in
volved in alum. Having taken a rise out of baking pow
der Mr. Polk is considered to be of Presidential size by
Mr. Johnson. He is no doubt a faithful and fearless
prosecutor, but one fight against alum does not make a
man of Presidential sire.
It is after all probable that the Ohio delegation, when
it gets to St. Louis, finding Ohio conservatism not fitted
to any other candidate, may settle on Hearst His meth
ods are like unto those of Johnson and. these two could
join forces without doing any violence to their principles.
There is a perceptible check, to. the Parker boom every
where. It is not going forward as was expected after
the New York convention. This may be due to the lead
ership of Mr. Hill, who has never been a favorite with the
party outside of New York. That he is smart and sly is
conceded, but even in the South, where the people are
willing to spell success with any letters, he failed to gain
a foothoW. . . ' f
From the present outlook the Democratic leaders seem
to be rather sparring for position in 1008 than trying to
win now. There is a deep-seated conviction that the de
feat of Roosevelt is impossible, and that the beat that
can be done is to build fences for the next time.

?Oor>yr.Â«ht. 11KM. by Jo^ph B. Bowie* >
Of all vibratory apparatuses in-
Vented by man for musical purposes,
the violin and its family are the most
wonderful, since the slender body of
the violin stands up under tension and
j>ours out an endless variety of musical j
and appealing tone for centuries to
pother. a mere fabric of thin wood
hold together by slue. I do not even
< are to assign to the violin a back seat
'in comparison with nature's work In
such musical compendiums as those
â¢of the little brown thrush; the bob-o-
Jitik. the meadow lark and the mock
ing bird: the'violin has greater range,
:i hiffher adaptability in tonal de
mands, and outlasts I know not how
many generations of the delightful
warblers of the bird tribe. Yet the
wonder is how much the birds do get
from their tiny pipes.
Xext to the violin I place the mod
ern concert piano. When the piano is
played by a really great master, of
the masterly technic which had taken
the trouble to rub off the traces of
art, as Godowsky. for â¢ instance, and
one sits a little away from the instru
ment, the result is beautifully spon
taneous in character. The instrument
>peems to be quite a? willing to thun
der ft* to Eing sweetly and melodious
ly, and it passes all the way from one
extreme to the other by all those
countless gradations of emotional
fluctuation which distinguish our mod
ern music.
Granted a scale capable of refined
'tonal, results, and a construction af
fording stability, everything else or
nearly everything else turns upon the
sounding board. Here is where a fine
and cultivated system of guesswork
still holds sway. The commercial artist
establishes as many measurements
and lines as he can; but the result is
after all greatly a matter of chance.
It was claimed by the late musical
savant, J. J. Fetis of Brussels?, that
Stradivarius in selecting wood for a
violin was in the habit of testing its
t*ibratory qualities by taking a pencil
like stick and drawing a bow over it
and listening to its tone. There are
rriany who think that Fetis probably
knew more upon this point than
Ftradivarius. yet the fact remains that
thÂ£ violins of Stradivarius have a
larger' vibration and great sonority
than any others, although* the young
est of them are now > 206 years old.
The violin has the advantage of the .
piano in that it can be taken apart
and glued up over again without feel
ing insulted. It is possible to renew
the sounding board in a piano, but it
is rarelr done, because it Involves re
constructing the instrument; it is |
nearly as radical as replacing a few
of the dorsal vertebrae in man.
The sounding board of an ordinary
upright piano is a thin spruce board
about a quarter-inch in thickness and
measures about four feet by live,
glued together in strips, out of the
heart of the wood. Sounding boards
used to be sawn in the piano factory
out of logs of spruce lumber, care
fully seasoned for many years: they
are now, by a very few, bought by
the hundred from planing mills built
expressly for handling this kind of
lumber. It is doubtful whether there
is a person who can accurately predict
tiVe tonal qualities of a sounding
beard while it is still in the lumber;
and it iÂ« quite certain that any pos
sible excellence of selection might be
ruined by bad handling, of which let
us speak. But first I will say that
young Albert Weber once told me,
when he was in his prime, that when
ever he had to start a particularly im
pdrtant instrument, an art piano or
a test instrument, he used to select a
certain kind of grain in the wood and
a certain tint, which he showed me.
There was no actual testing for tone;
that was left for the wood to answer
for. â¢Â¦;â¢Â¦â¢-.-
Now a piano sounding board labors !
under the following difficulties among |
others. It has to be free to vibrate
and it must be amiable enough to vi
brate easily, so that a lady can pla>\
it with pleasure. Yet the thim? has to
be fastened tightly to a frame and so
braced that.it can endure a crushing
drain of from one to two tons from
the strings for years together and
pwell up and shrinks bark again un
der the influence of moisture in the
eir, for there is no way of making
wood entirely insensible to moisture.
I, think a few makers have ways of
protecting their boards bo that they
reduce this element to a minimum,
but it is evident . that a board four
feet wide, fastened at the sides and
put on "crowning." i. e., convex to
ward the strings, can do nothing else
than bulge up more when the wet
Fwells it and shrink back again as it
(fries out. The violin shares this dif
.nculty. as you can hear in the tone
when the rain Is good and plenty.
Moreover, the violin also feels it in
the strings themselves, which soften
* in the wet and therefore, divide more
soggity into vibrating segments.
What we are after in the sounding
board 1$ to get in it as much as possible
of the vibration of the strings. To this
end the Btrins Is held perfectly rigid at
the end nearest where the hammer
strike*; away out toward the right it
rests upon a wooden bridge, which in
turn is glued upon a sounding board.
The string must rest so firmly upon
the bridge as to* transfer to the board
into the Jungle. The camel man was
either so frightened or the wholo
thing from beginning to end had occu
pied so short a time (less than a min
ute, I should judge), that he did not
stir from the place where he was when
the tiger made his first attack."
The discovery has been made again that certain of the
dives, which by grace of the police are permitted to
flourish on Market street, are selling intoxicants without
the formality of protection granted by a liquor license.
It is strange that the police have found out that these
dens exist on the greatest thoroughfare of the city" in
open defiance, of decency. And it is stranger still that
anybody' pretends that whisky is sold in these pitfalls
of the town. .'Â¦'
all its vibrations in all states of the
weather. Thus there are always up
ward of 250 steel wires pulling down
upon the bridge as they cross it, firmly
enough to *insure most of the vibration
passing directly into the board. To re
sist it the board is arched and strength
ened upon the back by means of ribs,
little strips of spruce, some' of them
nearly an inch in one dimension, and
the art Is to place these ribs where
they will do the most good. To illus
trate the refinements here possible I will
mention an incident told me of the first
producer of commercial pianos, or one
of the first. He desired to make the best
pmall upright possible for the money.
Accordingly he bought a small Stein
way upright and imitated it as closely
as he could. The result was A surpris
ingly good instrument for the price.
About a year later the late' George W.
Lyon chanced to mention this piano to
William Steinway, whereupon they
si-nt for one and went over it carefully,
recognizing the excellence of the in
strument. They then notified the maker
that He would have to change the num
ber of upright supports at the back of
the instrument or else change their po
sition, as tjie Steinway held patent
rights "upon . the combination of five
supports of these particular distances.
When he had made this change his lit
tle piano was a Samson whose locks
had been shorn. The posts behind had
been related to the ribbing of the
sounding board, and if the copying me
chanic had known the principle he
might still have accomplished his ends
by changing both to correspond. But
he did not. â¢
When these improvements in pianos
first began Helmholz had not yet pub
lished his results concerning the vibra
tions of wires. But already an inven-.
tion had been patented intended to use
what we might call a by-product of the
string vibration, namely, that part of
It which gets past the bridge toward
the end of the wire. The Stelnways
put another bridge farther on, at just
the distance to make an octave with
the fundamental tone, or a fifth, ac
cording to the range where they need
greater strength, of one harmonic or
another. â This adds to the sweetness
Â«.rf the tone. And it is further encour
agement of investigations not always
scientific, but primarily by ear and for
art purposes, that when ttfey sent one
of the best instruments to Helmholr
he wrote back that he had been obliged
to revise his theories concerning the
vibrations of steel strings, as they had
secured subdivisions which he had
found impossible.
There is this curious thing about
piano tone. I suppose that six pianos
by the best makers might be placed
side by side upon the stage, and if
played impartially by the same player
no person at the end of the hall, or
even fifty feet away, could pick out the
makes by the tone. This has been
tried over and over again, and, so far
as 1 know, it has never been done. We
always have to fall back upon the in
fallible criterion mentioned by a blind
St. Louis tuner who had just failed
in such an experiment. He wagered
that he could name a test which would
classify them every time. Upon ad
justing conditions he named It. It was
"the price at which they were sold."
tCow the question arises' how it is pos
sible for a particular make of piano to
sell invariably at a price not -simply a
few dollars higher, but generally from
J100 to $200 higher, and Btill not be dis
tinguishable at a distance from anoth
er sold at the lower price. This is a
nice question and "reputation" does
not satisfactorily solve it.
If I am buying a piano I want it for
the music. I expect to play it myself;
or I am buying it for some one who
will play it personally. Therefore, I
want to please myeelf or please the
player. Now pianos differ as much as
pet-ple. Some are, stolid things and
will never respond to anything short
of a gocd pounding: others will smile
sweetly and look lovingly even at a
bunch of violets. *The latter is the
kind of piano which gets popular. As
the older William Knabe ence remark
ed to me, stability was not enough; he
had that. What he wanted was (this
was ii\ I860) responsiveness, the qual
ity which pleased a lady, so that she
could get the music without forcing the
piano. So, while either for lack of
sufficiently masterly ears or something,
the half dozen^best pianos cannot be
distinguished when played by a third
parson, there are great differences to
the player himself in the responsive
ness they sh/>w to the delicate shades
of musical feeling.
It is a great pity that this element
in pianos is not better understood, be
cause It influences the'musical life and
the taste of pupils educated upon the
piano. With a really musical and
sensitive instrument all fine music
sounds vastly better. The delicate
fluctuation of come and go in the mu
sical tensions is responded to by the
piano and the player feels it and is
stimulated by it.
This quality is what we call "sym
pathetic resonance," and in plain Eng
glish we mean bv it the willingness
or tendency of strings not played
upon to vibrate sympathetically in
harmony with strings which' are act
ually flayed. It is unfortunate that in
music teaching the formation and edu
cation of the ear is neglected. If It
were otherwise I think we would hear
easily these differences between instru
ments which we now find out slowly
and by use.
It is not generally known to the
musical public, as it ought to be, that
there are, roughly speaking, three
rattier broad grades of commercial
rank in pianos. The first-class makers
produce the finest piano they know
how. I think some of them are" more
successful in the "know howr." Of
these one make almost invariably sells
at a higher price, and the others at
about an eoual level with each other.
Then there is a second rank of pianos
of superior quality â really musical _yet
sold at lower prices than those of the
first rank. Below these are the com
mercial, pianos, which # at wholesale
rarely differ much in equivalent styles,
but^at retail often do. Occasionally,
under the "standard" svstem of piano
selling (to "get all you can") buyers
pay for these cheap makes prices
which would entitle them to the best
A SIGNIFICANT sign of the progress of the times
: is the attitude of the public toward education:
Education used to be static in meaning. Young
men were sent to college to finish their education. Now
they are sent rather for the purpose of exciting the desire
and obtaining the material for education. Even the
teacher, that old-time essence of learning completed,
feels that the best incentive to the progress of his pupils
is that which comes from his 6wn progress, y
In recognition of this fact several of the greater
American universities â Columbia, Cornell, Harvard 'and^
Chicago, not to forget pur own University of California â '
have been offering summer courses, specially planned to
suit the needs of teachers. Recently the leading normal
schools of the Eastern States have provided more tech
nical lines of work for them. - * # '
Last year the Pacific Coast was represented in this
training of teachers in the profession as well as for the
profession by the San Jose State Normal School. It was
one among the nineteen normal schools in the country
doing summer work. The hearty response of teachers,
from various sections of the Pacific Coast proved con
clusively the understanding in the West of the. active ele
ment in education and gained for the teachers and their
fellows the privilege of another summer session. This
session will begin June 29 and close August 6. Courses
will be offered in all lines of primary and grammar
school work, special emphasis being put upon those rriost
difficult for the untrained teacher to work out for herself,
such as drawing, manua.1 training, ; nature study and
That some form of systematic and continuous work is
needed by our.teactiers is shown in the growing dissat
isfaction of the county teachers' institute held yearly
from three to five days in each county. A number of the
counties have passed resolutions voicing the sentiment
that these institutes be abolished. Some of the reasons
given for this action are that the time given to the meet
ing is too short for serious work to be accomplished, that
the subjects discussed are too numerous and varied for
even the most earnest and attentive teacher to be greatly
benefited, and that much of the work presented is not of
interest or value to the whole number assembled. The
summer school courses cover several weeks and a
teacher may register for as few or as many of them as
she feels she can well 'carry. The institute seldom pro
vides more than one. or two instructors. Â¦ The
summer school enlists its whole faculty, each member of
whom is a specialist in some one subject.
This "teachers' school" is almost as cosmopolitan in its
nature as the university./ Here are gathered together
men and women who have been widely separated by dis
tance and experience. The college graduate comes fresh
from the lecture-room to learn the best ways of present
ing what is already known. The primary teacher from a
far away mountain district comes to gather material for
presentation. The county superintendent, holding a life
diploma, comes to get a different point of view and to
broaden his horizon. Aside then from the work of the
school itself much is to be gained from the informal^ ex
change of ideas of peoplc*\vhps*e minds are so differently
conditioned.
When one considers the narrow setting of the lives of
large numbers .of our well-meaning but not truly edu
cated teachers (there are 4000 teachers in California who
have no professional training of any kind), when one
thinks of their lack of books, of their inability to make
use of the wealth of material all about them either for
their own benefit or that of their pupils, of their limited
appreciation of. music, literature, art, nature, of all the
great number of petty worries and half-formed, unful
filled desires that go to make up. the bulk of their daily
thought, one cannot but feel that this opportunity, this
helping-hand stretched out willingly to all, but especially
to the untrained teachers, of our oldest normal school is
a movement in the right direction. Six weeks of the sum
mer spent in learning to work more effectively, to see
farther, to- think more deeply, to live upon a higher plane,
will be returned to the teacher during the following year
in many an hour of active pleasure or quiet satisfaction. Â¦
Curing Fits.
There is a peculiar belief among cer
tain classes of people that when a dog
or a cat is subject to fits the cause of
the trouble" is the' squirming of a worm
in the animal's tail. It is believed that
the only method by which the quadru
ped may be cured is to have some one
bite off a portion of the tale and pull out
the worm. The worm is, of course, only
the marrow. It is said that several men
made money in San Francisco years
ago by biting oft the tails of cats and
dogs to cure them of fits. .Secretary
Holbrook of the Humane Society is au
thority for the statement that a certain
"Chaw" Murphy earned his sobriquet
in this manner.
A little girl who had evidently heard
of the strange treatment has sent the
following letter to Secretary Holbrook:
"We have a cat that has a worm in
its tall. It always runs around after
its tail and then lays down in a faint.
I have heard that there are men who
Â»bite off the end of a cat's tail and pull
out the worm. If there is any one out
at the Animals' Home who will do this
for me, please let me know by return
mall."
NORMAL SUMMER SCHOOLS.
Colombia to the effect that as a result of the severance
t)f Panama all southern republics would unite in indis
soluble bonds against the United States. Colombia
would have us believe that at a signal every soldier from
"the isthmus to Patagonia would arise to the common
defense of the continent against the aggressions of the
northern republic. And here two of our respected sister
republics are on the point of war about a shadowy
boundary that has never known a surveyor's transit.
While the South American republics persist in their pas
time of fighting one another with each recurrent summer
solstice, Uncle Sam need not worry about drawing up a

SECURES NEW ARTISTS
FOR SUMMER SEASON
Such a priceless collection of literary
treasures as Is contained in the State
Library ought not to be expored to ordi
nary hazards of destruction by fire. At
th<> earliest possible day a building
should be erected for it that will be
beautiful, commodious and, above all
else, strictly fireproof.
What the State university as an up
lifting force has become to th? schools
it is hoped that the State- library will
In its own field realize to the libraries
of California.
Additional legislation will be sought
which will enable the Trustees to so
brnoden the use of this reservoir of
knowledge that not a community in this
commonwealth ncd go without, its in
ppiripg aid. Some of these lines of
development may be to furnish tran
scripts of maps, taMes, books and man
uscripts by professional copyists; ~to
supply desired information regarding
the construction of public library
buildings', to send out books for blind
persons and traveling portfolios of en
gravings to high and nornai schools;
to co-cperate with university extension
courses and women's club work: to
organize public libraries and strengthen
weak oner,; to render advisory aid to
school libraries; to publish lists of
books of special value to different li
braries; to increase the interest of
fchool teachers and superintendents in
library influence and to constantly pro
mote !n the public mind a high sense of
the educational value of libraries In all
communities.
NEW LAWS WANTED.
Their wide use will greatly stimulate
individual and club study. At the pres
ent time single books are freely loaned
to any responsible person, preferably
through the library or schoof authori
ties, on payment of express charges.
The State Library is to be effectively
represented at the St. Louis Exposi
tion. The exhibit will be under the
charge of Professor Furiong. in whose
care the other educational exhibits of
the State are placed. The library dis
play consists of a large map of Califor
nia, showing the locations of existing
public libraries; a booklet for free dis
tribution of a description of their his
tory and giving views of many of the
buildings; a revolving case of Califor
nia views; a panoramic representation
of the State Capitol ana grounds; an
ordinary traveling llbray, one of books
on Russia and a third one of important
publications upon California and those
written by California writers; a sam
ple newspaper index and sample card
catalogue. / ;
So much for the past and the pres
ent. What is to be the future of the
State Library? If the plans of the'
Trustees are carried out it is to enter
upon a course cf widest usefulness. AH
this gathered wealth of books, dealing;
with the arts and sciences and con
cerned with every pursuit followed by
the citizens of the State; all of the lore
of th^ ages which gives food to thought
and impulse to learning:, ia to be made
beneficial to the people of California.
An arrangement has been made by
which a part of the expenses of the
Glee Club -of the University of Cal
ifornia on Its tour to the East will b^
paid from the funds of the general
committee having in charge the San
Francisco building and exhibit at St.
Louis. A certain sum of money has
been agreed upon to be paid to the
university singers for six concerts in
the San Francisco building at the ex
position. A series of -lectures to be
illustrated with views of San Fran
cisco has been planned and the sing
ing of the University of California
Glee Club will accompany the lec
tures, the songs being interspersed.
The Glee Club has an Itinerary fpr. a
concert season in : the East tKat will
culminate at St. Louis. The San
Francisco management has seen that
the Glee Club will be a large'attrac
tion to the San Francisco building
and will hold the people while the
beauties and advantages of living in
this oity are duly set forth to an au
dience. At the same time the sum
to be paid, while it is not large, being
le.Â«3 than $500, will give the four of
the Glee Club a guarantee of com
plete success. The arrangement
therefore promises to be . of mutual
value.

The beauty .of the entrance to the
Mechanics' Institute library on Post
street has been enhanced by a mural
painting and decorations by Arthur. F.
Matthews. The painting was uncov
ered yesterday and was pronounced
clever by those who have seen it. The
improvements in the entrance are the
gifts of Rudolph J. Tausslg, president
of the institute.
The mural decoration is the finest of
its kind in the city and it is expected
that it will establish a precedent in
the beautifying of public buildings.
The picture is an exquisite blending of
both detail and color and is symbolical
a carved bench and a pretty window in
the south wall. The entire building is
now lighted by electricity and the
library will soon be one of the hand
somest in the West. The rooms
have been made more spacious for vis
itors and the system of arranging books
more perfect. A large Increase in the
number of volumes and valuable and
modern literature added. The chess
and reading rooms will be improved
and every convenience afforded to sub
scribers. The recent report of Secre
tary Joseph Curnmings shows a large
increase in the membership and many
applications are received daily.

" The argument on the application of
Attorney George D. Collins to con
tinue the restraining order made by
Judge Cook in the matter of the forty
two warrants sworn to before Police
Judge Cabanisa for the arrest of >the
inmates at 1129 Dupont street was
continued before the Judge yesterday.
It was contended by Collins that the
warrants were obtained by subterfuge
to enable the police to gain entrance
to the premises and arrest the inmates.
Fictitious names were given on the
warrants in violation of the injunction
and of the constitution, which says that
the person must be described. For the
respondents it. was argued that the
warrants were obtained in good faith.
The Judge reserved his decision till
May 31.

OnÂ« of the richest, though least
known, possessions of the people of
California is ihe State Library at Sac
ramento. It will afford satisfaction to
Â¦ the citizens of California to learn that
the policy which has governed this
library for mwre than fifty years has
been radically changed. This old time
policy considered the State Library as
. being purely for reference use, a place
â¢Jor investigation and research by any
one who would go there â with the ex
ception of the issuance of books to
certain State crflicers and to members
of the L<egis'aiure during a session.
The State Library was established by
Â£,n act of the first Legislature, held
at San Jose, 1849-1SD0. During the half
' iTlHl 11 J since its creation it has re
ceived senerous support and at the
â¢ present time has a larger income than
any other State library in the United
* tHates save that of New York. The
income is derived from rees paid into
the office of the Secretary of State and
nu-w amounts to $2500 per month.
- -The entire collection of volumes in
â¢the library is not far from 125,000 and
is divided into a number of depart
ments.
The first important deal in redwood
timber land in this State this year was
effected yesterday, when a large tract
of forest in lower Humboldt County
was (transferred to -the Metropolitan
Lumber Company of Green Bay, Wis.,
Donovan and O'Connor of Menominee,
Mich., and Charles Culbertson of Boul
der, Colo. The transaction was the re
sult of a visit to California last year of
Congressman Fordney of Saginaw,
through whom the deal was made.
The purchase price is said to be 1600,
000, of which a large payment has al
ready been made. The tract, it is esti
mated, has in the neighborhood of 400,
000,000 feet of timber on it and Is ac
cessible by way of the new railroad
route to Eureka. The purchasers have
announced their intention of organiz
ing a new company, which will pro
ceed in a few months to erect a big
mill on the ground and prepare for the
shipment of its product to the coast by
way of Eureka, where it will be loaded
on schooners to be built by the com
pany. A party of the investors are ex
pected here from the East during the
first week In June to look over the
property. - .

Brooklyn Handicap May Start With
out the Big Horse.
NEW, YORK, May 24.â McChesney
has temporarily gone wrong. There is
a ' possibility that heroic treatment
may result in his being able to go to
the post for the Brooklyn handicap,
but to-night this was a hope rather
than a 'conviction. The big horse has
shown lameness in his work, and it
may be necessary to throw him out of
training. \

CLEVEREST HEAVYWEIGHT AMATEUR BOXERS OF AMERICA. WHO ARE TO
MEET TO-NIGHT IN MECHANICS' PAVILION IN A FOUR-ROUND BOUT.
THE CALIFORNIAN IS A STRONG FAVORITE IN THE BETTING,
Although amateur boxing and bet
ting are not supposed to go together,
there Is considerable money being
wagered on the meeting to-night in
Mechanics' Pavilion between William
Rodenbach, the American champion,
and Sam Berger, the Pacific Coast
champion. Berger, being 'a home pro
duct, is favored by the bettors. He
opened an 8 to 10 choice and the price
dropped quickly to 6 to 10.
As Rodenbach has defended his title
to the American championship for
four years against all comers this
seems a false price. The bettors are
counting on Berger's remarkable speed
and also on the marked advantage he
has in height, reach and weight to re
turn him a winner at the end of the
fourth round.
Rodenbach is conceded to have had
the wider ring experience, but how
far that will carry him with a man of
Berger's undoubted cleverness as a
boxer will have to be demonstrated in
the ring. The Eastern man has made
a favorable impression on visitors at
his quarters, some Beeing in him the
counterpart of Joe Walcott as a hard
hitter from any position.
The other eight bouts are: Jim Daly
of the Olympic Club vs. Billy Batten of
the Hawthorne Club; J. Adams of the
Belmont Club vs. Pat Sullivan of the
Hawthorne Club; Lew Powell vs. Bob
Lundie; Bert Marsh vs. Bob Cairns;
Al Young vs. Tom McGreel, and Harry
Chester vs. Jack Walsh.
Four of the foregoing bouts are for
the Coast championships in various
classes. Eddie Graney will referee all
the bouts, while Phil Wand and E. J.
Smith will act as judges.
PETALUM A, May 24.â Harry
Stover has succeeded in getting a con
cession, from the Pacific Jockey Club
to extend his* race meet one day. This
will :make the closing date Monday
(Decoration day). As the day will be
observed in this city a big. attendance
is expected. ' A large week day crowd
attended the races to-day The
weather was fine and the track fast.
Ten books are doing business. Bet
ting was lively and the books did well.
Ed Duke has been appointed an of
ficial, vice F. E. Mulholland.who has
gone to Harbin Springs to renew ac
quaintance with Champion Jeffries.
Capp & Co.'s colt, Only Jimmie, won
his second race of the meeting to
day, scoring handily against a good
field. Stover, as usual, came in for 'a*
winning, St. Phillipina taking the
event for four-year-old mares. The
Lieutenant kept some of the Kenil-*
worth money at home, taking second
place in the fourth event. The'sum

lance. Fortunately it turned out that
Green was not badjly injured.
Even the last race yielded Its sensa

CHICAGO, May 24.â Ed Corrigan's
imported colt , McGee furnished the
sensational feature to-day at Haw
thorne. Carrying 120 pounds and' with
Lawrence on his back, McGee won the
fourth race, a handicap at one mile,
with impressive ease.
Corrigan and his friends are said to
have won largely on the race. Opening
at 6 to 5, -the money poured into the
ring on McGee in such large chunks
that in a short time even money was
the best to be had about him. The
Corrigan colt had the race at his mercy
soon after the barrier went up, and he
won as his rider pleased.
On Saturday McGee. with 112 pounds
up, ran third to Bad News, apparently
being short of work and unable to go
more than six furlongs. Outside of Me-
Gee's- sudden return to form, the fea
ture was the dead heat in the fifth race
betwen Lacy Crawford and Major
Mansir. A dead heat is a rare thing in
this vicinity, the one to-day being the
first in years. .
Although the track was good and the
weather pleasant, only a small crowd
witnessed the races, many people evi
dently resenting the action of the race
track officials in cutting out the tele
graph seryloe, thereby compelling peo
ple to. bet their money at the track or
not at. all,.." .

SUMMARY
McCreedie started the doings with a
two-base bingler over Hildebrand's
head. Xadeau was right there with a
drive to left, and Beck came back with
one of the scratchy order which was
pood enough to chase McCreedie home.
Francis had another in his bat and it
produced one more tally. Murphy's
scratchy one filled- up the bags, and
.Fteelman's hot smash, which Irwin
"could not get his mitts on, brought
J3eck in with the third for the inning.
After that no runs showed till the
ninth, when Portland eased one more
over, aided by McCreedie's hit, Na
dead's out and Beck's drive. Iburg
pitched grand ball in every inning and
San Francisco never had a chance to
pain runp. Walter Christie, the popular
University of California trainer, um
pired the game, and his decisions were
just and fair. The score,:

All the damage was done in the ini
tial round. It was then Mr. Leftpaw
Jones was assailed to the extent of
three tallies and twice as many base
hits. Every man on the team came up
to the bat, and all , but three of them
swung on the leather. Most of the hits
were little dinky affairs, which just
managed to flop ungracefully away
from the inflelders' mitts and winder
to the outfield.
; * "Ham" Iburg refused to bestow any
easy or brotherly curves on his former
running mates when they lined up
against him yesterday afternoon on the
Oakland field. He was mean and stingy
to the extent of sending: them away
runless. The only concessions he al
low.ed were five hits. Score, Portland

Wntor Front Notes.
runny Adele Burns I/ons Tlmo.
The swift current of the San Joaquin
has caused shc-als in the vicinity of
Central Landing, where deep water
would be of more service. By diverting
the current's course tne water power
that made the shoal can be used to
dredge away the accumulation. The
hull of the Bounding Biliow is to be
used as a wing dam for this purpose.
She will be filled with rocks and sunk
in a snot selected by the engineers in
charge of the work of changing the
direction of the current. That will be
the last of the whaler Bounding Bil
low, more recently known as the coal
barge Carbon.
The barge Carbon ont-c rejoiced in
the name Bounding Billow and fifty
years aso was as tight and trim a
little whaling bark as ever sailed on
a blubber hunt. She was built in 1S54
at Chelsea, Mass.. and tor many years
sailed northern and southern waters in
search c-f whales. She was small,
measuring only 228 tons, and is best
remembered for the whales she did not
get. The Bounding Billow's ill luck
was a byword among whalemen.
She was owned by 'Wright. Bowne &
Co., of this city, who sold her, years
ago, to the Piper-Aden-Goodall Com
pany, by whom she was converted into
a coal barge. Her name was changed
to Carbon. She finished her floating
career carrying black diamonds about
the harbor.
The coal barge Carbon was towed
up the San Juaquin River yesterday
to Centra! Landing on Bouldin Island,
there to be filled with rock, scuttled
and sunk and finish,, as wing: dam.
half a century of varied service. The
taking away of the Carbon cuts one
mere link with a past day when wood
en ships were built to last and were
known among men by names that sug
gested something of the romantic side
of sea life.
"I do not believe the men are well
organized along the line." he said, "and
what is more, they are not so disaf
fected generally as they are here. In
New York they will go out for nothing,
but elsewhere it needs a real grievance
to raak? them quit work. This they
have not got. We now have all the
freight handlers that we need and are
engaplng no more. We are short of
firemen, but apparently J there are
plenty to be had."
Curran was atked if he would call
out the teamsters, "but he declined to
rftake a direct answer, saying:
"No teamster will handle the com
pany's freight :ifter they understand
the situation. We are all union men."
Superintendent ShepanI of the rail
road said that he had no fear that the
trouble would affect the New Haven
Fystem in general.
NEW YORK. May 21.â The strike
which began several days ago with the
refusal of rei^ht handlers employed by
ihÂ« Fail River line to continue work
unless a -non-union foreman to whom
they objected were discharged, and
which has resulted in a serious tie-up
of freight trufiic between New York
.tnd many New England points, as-
Mimed a serious phase to-day, when
:hÂ« .\>w York. New Haven and Ilart
icr'l Railroad Company's transfer sys
tem across the East Ri\W between
Matt Haven and the Xew Jersey snore
M-fta effectively tied up by a strike of
Orciueu on the transfer boats.
TbÂ» firemen, who are members of ihe
Atlantic Coast Marine Firemen's
I'niof, demand an increase 'in wajres,
Khoner hours and better food. As a re
sult of this tfe-ap hundreds of fire
men, engineers and brakemen employed
on fr*Â»ij:ht trains in the Mott Haven
yarÂ«ls v ere forced into idleness and
â¢iW of them were laid off.
Hundred? of cars, many laden with
)>eriÂ£hal>k- s^ods. bound for points
:*outh of New York, stood all day in the
Mott Haven yards and it was believed
that serious luss would result.
President Curran said to-day: "The
tipht between the men and "the rail
road company is now a lipht to the
tl<^th. We offered the management
â¢â¢very concession, but it se. ms that the
Â«o:npa::y desires to lipht it out. They
would not listen to our proposition and
thvy seom to have agreed not to take

PORTLAND. Or., May 24.â Judge
Alfred F. Sears in the State Circuit
Court to-day rendered a decision re
storing to P. A. Marquam a block of
property in this* city valued at
$1,000,000. Marquam was the original
owner of the property, but became
financially embarrassed and the prop
erty was sold at a delinquent tax. sale
to the Title Guarantee and Trust Com
pany. It afterward appeared that the
title company had been acting as the
agent of Marquam, but through a sec
ond party had purchased Â¦ the Mar
quam property in its own right. This
action Judge Sears holds to be illegal
and the property js thus restored to
Marquam, the original owner.
The decision of Judge Sears exoner
ates the title company of willful
wrongdoing in the transaction.

UKIAH, May 24.â Charles Penio, the
oldest chief of the Ukiah tribe, died at
the Cox rancheria yesterday and the
Indians are having a. death feast. Penio
was 107 years old and ruled the Ukiahs
long before the white settlers 1 arrived.
Penio had been judge and Jury for
the tribt, but was deposed about twen
ty-five years ago for killing Sam War
den. "Warden and another Indian had
quarreled over a game of cards. Penio
was sent for and had Warden tied to a
tree to be shot. The victim dodged the
first bullet, which so infuriated the
chief that he seized an ax and chopped
off Warden's head. Penio was held in
jail for several months, but none of the
Indians could be induced to testify
against him.
Penio had always resented the en
croachment of the- whites and was con
sidered dangerous. He was buried in
Indian style, with his pony and war
implements.

pure thought, clear vision. He tells you what

cult analysis as he is for his original ex-
pression and vivid truthfulness. j
A test reading is not a life reading. When

you when you call on him for a first-class
, clairvoyant readingf
He asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.

fortunes you axe hefr to. You are acquainted
with the facts ln your case. Let PROF.
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.'

APPRAISE MISS CLARK'S ESTATE.â ThÂ»
estate of the late Isabella D. Clark, tha
wealthy younK woman who committed suicide
at McNutt's Hospital last year,' was appraised
yesterday at $53Â«>.44t>. It consists of jewelry
worth $7109 cash In bank $27lKl and realty
worth $544,544.
When the noise had subsided Judge
Troutt put the case over a week, sug
gesting that in the meantime Kawal
kowski make some provision for hia
children.
The entire Kawalkowskl family,
consisting of Frank Kawalkowski and
his nine children, took part in a live
ly scene in Judge Troutt'3 court yes
terday during the hearing of the suit
of Martha Kawalkowskl, the defend
ant's eldest daughter, to compel him
to support her little brothers and
sisters. As Miss Kawalkowski, after
leaving the witness stand was pass
ing her father, he made some remark,
which caused her to suddenly stop.
She looked at him for fully half a
minute and then screamed and fell in
a faint. The rest of the family rushed
to her assistance and added to tha
noise by talking and shouting.
Kawalkowski is supposed to have a
matrimonial mania and this is the
cause of the trouble. He has been ex
amined as to his sanity, but has never
been committed. His children say ha
does not support them because he
spends his time and money in the pur
suit of some woman to take the place
of their mother, who died in June,
1902.

EXPECT CONTROVERSY WILL
SOON COME TO AN END
Boot and Shoo Workers Hope That
Vice President lively Will
Settle Differences.
Great hopes are entertained by the
boot and shoe workers that now that
Vice President Lovely is here the dif
ferences existing between them and
their late employers will be adjusted to
the satisfaction of all concerned.
Inasmuch as the disagreement orig
inated over the introduction of mod
ern machinery and was not a ques
tion of wages or hours, it is thought
there will not be much in the dispute
to Â¦ settle.

NEW YORK, May 24.â Prices dropped back
easily and practically without opposition to
day to about the level of last Friday, before
tbe little stir In the market on that day,
caused by last week's great loan contraction
I by the banks. The weakness was not due
I to-<Jay, as far as could be perceived, to any
news or to any new element of weakness.
I Rather it was a simple recognition of the
! absorption of an Incident boom and the hasty
gettlcs out of small speculative holdings In
consequence. London prices reported here be
fore our market opened showed declines
throughout. The throwing over of Saturday's
and yesterday's accumulations was then pretty
quickly accomplished and tbe market relapsed
Into the stagnant and drooping tone which
characterized It during most of last week.
With the relapse In the money market the
bankers' loan bills, which had weakened the
exchange market, disappeared and gold was
engaged -for export Thursday to the amount
of $2,000,000, all that the assay office could
furnitsh. Tbe freedom of the - outward gold
[movement I* now more clearly recosnized as
following from the extreme lassitude of the
demand for eecurities here, as against the
[ sucpocltlon that the demand for securities
was being paralyzed by the fears of the effects
I of gold exports. The Paris money market
j advanced the rate of sterling exchange to
25 francs 11 '4 centimes, compared with last
week's low level of I0V4 centimes. Speculative
I depression here was due rather to general dis
couragement than â¢ to specific developments.
Published reports of plans for the large cur
tailment of plglron production were regarded
as a bad augury for the Industry and business
and had special effect on United States Steel
1 preferred. Attention was given to the hearing
J before the Interstate Commerce Commission
1 of â¢ barjjes of discrimination by the coal roads
J and the presence of the District Attorney of
the I'nltea States was used to give an im
pression that Government action under the
artl-trust act was In contemplation.
The grain markets' movements Indicated an
Interpretation of the weather bureau's weekly
summary favorable to the hopes of the crops,
but the istock' market failed to be influenced.
The last prices of the day were near the
lowest and the closing tone was . heavy and
very dull.
I Bonds were eaey.Â» Total sales, $1,705,000. !
United States bonds were unchanged on call.

old Potatoes, which are dragging at unsteady
prices. Red Onions are steady under moder
ate receipts and a good demand for shipment.
Nearly everything In the vegetable line waÂ«
in free supply and prices had but slight
! variance.. Asparagus still showed the effects
of the recent hot wave and a good portion of
the receipts came- to hand in poor condition.
The regular trade purchased but little, but
the market was held steady by the canners,
who were operating freely and paying 4@.1c

CHICAGO, May 24. â With practically noth
ing of a bullish character as support, the
wheat market opened with an Inclination
toward lower prices. The effect of the bear
ish private- crop report of yesterday was still
a potent Influence, the majority of pit traders
being disposed to sell. Opening quotations on
July were unchanged fo VnC Jower at 87WS*
87%c. Excellent weather throughout the
greater part of the country continued to Im
prove the condition of the growing crop and
helped to bring out additional selling orders.
The May delivery was especially, heavy, and
the weakness of that option had a tendency to
depress the deferred futures. A general ex
pectation of Increasing primary receipts was
another element against which the bull lead
ers had to contend. In a measure the expec
tations of enlarged receipts were realized by
returns from Kansas City, where 120,000 bush
els were received and only 3(5,000 buehels
shipped.
During the last part of the session bearish
sentiment was emphasized by Bradstreet's
visible supply statement, which showed a de
crease In the world's available stocks of only
043,000 bushels, against a decrease of nearly
4.000,000 bushels a year ago. The weekly Gov
ernment report Indicated marked Improve
ment In crop conditions. As a result of the
numerous bear factors there wa3 much real
izing latei tn the day, July closing Tg@lc lower
at 80%Â®86^c. May closed at Â»5>,;c.
A weak undertone was manifested In corn,
July closing He lower at 47%Â®47%.
Weakness of wheat and corn led to a con
nldcrable selling of oats. July closed $4c lower
at 37%c.
Provisions were easier In sympathy with
the lower grain markets. Pork closed 7^c
lower and lard and ribs were unchanged.

This market for caBh grain remains un

the market and the millers are not active buy

yesterday.
CASH WHEAT.
The American markets show little change and
there Is no further change In crop conditions,
which continue fair, except In the Ohio Valley
and one or two other sections of the winter
A\heat belt.
WHEAT FREIGHTSâ The shippers are not
in the market and rates are consequently nom
inal at about IBs 3d for spot and 21s 6d asked
for new crop loading. The chartered Wheat
fleet In port has a registered tonnage of 6807.
against 1500 tons on the same data last year;
disengaged. 84,720 tons, against 84,000; on the
W^Â£Â»V phls P 01 " 1 - 2t51 .Â°OO tons, against 397,460.
\VHEATâ The Liverpool and Parts markets
continued closed. ' Broomhall gave the condi
tion of the crop In Europe as good, except In
that r-art' of Roumania lately affected by
drought. The growth, however. Is rather slow
everywhere. North Africa reports most fa
vorable conditions.
Wheat and Other Grains.
Receipts of Cherries were over 22C0 boxes
and the market ruled very weak at easier rates,
as local dealers purchased sparingly and ship
ping brokers were holding off in anticipation of
lower prices. Sales of exceptionally fine lots
were reported In a small way at 85c per drawer,
but the ruling prices for the best lots were
0(KÂ§75c. the latter being about the top for the
general market. Quite a surplus of both
packed and loose stock had to be carried over.
Receipts of Strawberries continued too heavy
for the market to readily absorb and they
wire weak at previous prices, with the canners
still purchasing the large varieties at the
minimum quotation. Longworths still showed
the effects of the recent hot weather In the
growing districts, being more or less sun
burnt. Raspberries from the south sold at 20c
per small basket and three crates from New
castle, the first of the season from that quar
ter, brought $1 50 each. Blackberries and
Loganberries brought $8 per chest and crates
of the latter. frCm Fowler, Fresno County,
brought $1 75@2. Gooseberries were very
weak, with poor lots Of the common kinds sell
ing below the quotations.

again and *61d at 50c each. Twelve, boxes of
Black Figs came In from Palm Springs. Rlver

Receipts of Butter continue heavy. aÂ» will
be seen, "but th- market seems to b- taking
car* of them, much to the surprise of many
houses, who say they do not know where the
Butter Is going to, unless seme firms are quietly
storing and' keeping It dark. Los Angeles Is
taking some, but the Alaskan orders are mostly
filled, though one line which is being put up
In tins will not be completed for some little
time yet. There is considerable apprehension
among the trade that the recent advance will
enable Eastern Butter to flow In here, to toe
ultimate detriment of the market for the State
product, and about half the important houses
would have preferred to let prices stand where
tMy were and thus avoid this possible future
condition.
Cheese continues plentiful and depressed.

Dr. Emmal Informed Judge Mogan
that he no longer fears a fatal out
come of the stabbing of Mrs. Clara
"Sure you may. I Â¦ got out of jail

given me six months I wouldn't 'a'

"You're a good fellow," said Mary
Locke to Judge Fritz after he had sen
tenced her to thirty days for drunk
enness.
"Thank you. Mary," blushingly re
sponded his Honor; "but may I ask
wherein you find evidence of my good
ness?" .Â«#
After hearing all the evidence for
and against Joseph Egan, alias "The
Kid." Judge Mogan intimated that he
would send the case to the Superior
Court. Egan is accused of having
brutally assaulted a man who was
driving a team belonging to a teaming
establishment boycotted by the Stable
men's Union. He had been in trouble
before.
Denis OXeary, a brawny blacksmith,
was given nine months in the County
Jail for beating his seventy-four-year
old mother and Judge Mogan express
ed regret that he could not make the
fellow's punishment more severe, as it
was the third offense of that kind
of which the brute had been convicted.
It was testified that because he sus
pected his sister Mary of having taken
two ducks from the family flock at
319 Twenty-ninth street he had visited
his wrath unen his mother, striking
her with a chair and hurling a stove
lid after* her as she fled from his pres
ence. Hi? previous conviction was fol
lowed by a six months' sentence.
"Allan. Earl de Montespan, petty lar
ceny," was the way it appeared on
Judge Fritz's calendar, but expecta
tion of seeing a scion of Britain's proud
nobility was shattered by the discovery
that the comma after the first name
had no proper place there. Nor did
Allan Earl de Montespan, former pri
vate in the United States infantry, be
tray aristocratic lineage as he pleaded
not guilty to the charge of having
stolen a coat from his roommate. Two
policemen failed to make the charge
stick, and A. E. D. M. was dismissed.
Ostentation was conspicuously ab
sent from the wedding of Miss Bertha
Kewnig and young William Hampshire
at high noon yesterday in the court
room of Police Judge Mogan, who of
ficiated with wonted grace and dignity.
The 16-year-old bride's comely coun
tenance wore a genuine smile of con
tent that was better to look upon than
trailing satin and orange blossoms, and
the 21-year-old groom did not seem to
feel embarrassed in his workaday at
tire. She was supported by her mother,
Mrs. Barbara Kewnig, and a few other
female members of the family faction
in whose cause she threw a brick and
provoked arrest, and he was upheld by
the moral support of every man in the
chamber. A large number of the Bar
bara Kewnig adherents would have
been In at the ceremony if attention to
their daily vocations had not prevent
ed. Among those who sent regrets
were .Padishah Y. Kewniff, in the
canned tamale trade; Mrs. Abner N.
Kewnig, detained by imminent aug
mentation of her maternal responsi
bilities, and Mrs. L. Gallinger Kewnig,
hunting a desirable flat. Still there
were enough of Mrs. Barbara's sympa
thizing clansmen and kinswomen in
evidence to choke the corridor before
they were admitted to the chamber.
Mrs. Barbara gave away her daugh
ter, and Master Hampshire accepted
the fair sift with manly nervousness.
When the knot was tied the Judge de
livered a touching address to the young
couple, and so deeply affected by the
scene was Dick Jose, the famous tenor,
that in a voice clogged with emotion
he began chanting "The Fated Wed
ding." instead of humming the Men
delssohn nuptial march, as he had been
invited to do. His blunder was fortu
nately overlooked in the general desire
to extend congratulations to the newly
wedded pair.
After a trolley ride to the beach and
return Mr. and Mrs. Hampshire took
up housekeeping at the residence of the
bride's mother. 65 Prospect avenue,
where they will be at home to friends
as soon as the groom gets a job. He
is a valuable acquisition to the house
of Barbara, as he holds a Hawthorne
Club lightweight boxing championship
and is physically fit as a fiddle.
It may not be amiss to add that
after marrying Miss Bertha to the lad
of her choice Judge Mogan dismissed
the charge of brickthrowlng that
brought her into his court and indirect
ly led her to the altar.
Daniel Nunan, employed by Bis
slnger & Co., dealers In hides, pleaded
guilty to having had consigned to him
120 deerskins in violation of the game
laws and Judge Mogan fined him $50.
Peter Olesen expressed readiness to
swear that Mary Hawley pilfered $25
from his pocket as he slumbered in a
Mission-street lodging-house,. and Pa
trolman J. J. Moran, who arrested the
woman, â¢ informed Judge Mogan that
in his opinion Peter knew what he
was talking about. The full story Will
be brought out next Monday.
Marcus N. Carroll tried .to scare his
better half by threatening to -. gulp a
large bottleful of carbolic acid, but
instead of . being intimidated she had
him arrested for disturbing the peace.
"Is the defendant in court?" in
quired Judge Mogan.
"Yes, sir," responded Mr. Carroll,
rising from amid the spectators; "you
told me to come back when you let me
go on my own re-re-resignation."
Before the attorneys' table re
covered its equanimity the case had
been dismissed.
"Come back to-morrow and learn
your fate," said Judge Mogan, "but
don't bring the instruments you men
tioned to prove your claim to musician
ship. I'd l-ather take your word for
that than have it practically corrobo
rated."
â¢vi'se no vag, but er profeshnul
musician," pleaded George Smith
(colored), after he had been accused
of depending for a livelihood upon the
terpsichorean toil of Miss Thelma
Taylor of 14 Pinckney alley. "I oper
ate wif de piano, de banjo an' de
bones," he continued, in injured tone,
"an" if dem instruments wur heah 'I'd
prove my 'sertion. As fo' dis yah
lady, my 'tenshuns ter her hev been
strickly hon'ble. I've seen her home
wunst er twicst, but 'tis wus only so
cial cuhtesy ter do dat â nuffin' mo.' "
Thirteen was an unlucky number for
George Smiley,' for he was given six
months by Judge Mogan for having
stolen one dozen and one suits of
clothes from room No. 6, 44 East
street, occupied by James Richards.
It was also proved that he had em
bezzled 535 from J. H. Flattmann, and
for that he was given six months
more.
"That I cannot answer until I have
ascertained something more concern
ing your character," was the reply;
"but don't be startled if it happens
to be ten or ten, or even twenty-five
or twenty-five. I'll enlighten you to
morrow." *
"What's the diff ?" she asked, giving
the gum quid an extra crunch. "It's
five or five, ain't it?"
With her hands thrust deep in the
side pockets of a navy blue "reefer"
and her blonde coiffure surmtmnted by
a natty yachting cap, Matilda Peter
son gnawed gum and*laced a vagrancy
charge in Judge Mogan's court. She
offered no defense and adroitly side
stepped his Honor's casual inquiry as
to whether she was a sure-enough
yachtswoman or had merely donned
the costume because it enhanced her
natural charms.
William Reardon, Frank Holland,
Walter Vogle and Thomas McMahon
were the names registered by the de
fendants, and it was alleged that they
and three other lads, still uncaptured,
stole the barrel from Signor Cassino's
store at Army and Alabama streets,
rolled it to a sequestered cave in a
near by hillside and there held wassail
until they were discovered and ar
rested. They had drunk deeply of the
beverage.
"If these lads survive till next Fri
day, I'll hear more about this case,"
said his Honor, still gazing as if fas
cinated by the unruffled countenances
of the quartet that had imbibed freely
of claret retailed at 27 cents a gallon.
L. A. Cassino testified that the ten
gallon barrel of claret stolen from him
was valued at $2 70 and as Judge Mo
gan looked at the four boys charged
with the theft his face plainly ex
pressed wonder that they were not de
funct, or at least very sick..
"It's dead easy, cully, dead easy,"
muttered Leland as he was re-entering
the prisoners' cage.
But the remark was overheard by
Bailiff Hickey and repeated to the
Judge, who glanced at its author in a
way that did not presage leniency if
he is convicted.
H. M. Leland, a husky-looking fel
low, was beating his fragile better
half, Vernie, when a policeman arrest
ed him at 6 o'clock yesterday morning
on Kearny street, near Pacific. The
woman told Judge Morgan that soon
after coming here from her parents^
home at Santa Maria she met and mar?
ried Leland, who immediately compell
ed her to support him by working in a
dance hall. As evidence of the assault
she displayed a bruised and scratched
face. Disturbing the peace and va
grancy were the charges- entered
against the defendant, but when the
Judge glanced at the woman's scarred
countenance he instructed the police
man to add a formal accusation of bat
tery and then he continued the case
till to-morrow.
