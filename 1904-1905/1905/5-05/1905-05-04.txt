PREDICTS TOGO'S DEFEAT.
BOSTON, May S.â A private let
ter from an administration official,- In
Washington cays that p Embassadors
Jusserand of France and Stemburg of
Germany are only awaiting the return
of President Rooeevelt to the capital to
learn his views on the question of peace
between Russia Â«n<i Japan before sail
. ing for their respective countries. This
Is the real reason, for the President's i
sudden change of plans. He hopes be
fore May 15 to be able to do something
for peace. He will, communicate to' the
Embassadors of the European:' powers,
to Russia and to Japan, the terms upon
which^tha United States will insist: in
the treaty ot_ peace between ilthe^ two
y.*arring' nations. v-s-.""; 7: '- \u25a0' r '>' v -;
â¢ "Asa power ha\-ing material interests
at* stake In the ; Philippines I and com
; mercfal interests 'on' the'AElatic'maln
lana, the United States will be as much
entitled as any neutral power to dictate
some of the terms on which peace shall
be based... : . .. .
The letter says the main terms upon
which the United States will Insist were
long ago discussed and decided upon in
Washington. Holding fast to the pol
icy; having as its sole purpose the main
tenance- of the integrity of China and
j the "open door," the United States will
strive, not only for the expulsion of
Russia from Manchuria, but it also will
expect the Japanese Government to ad
here to the pledges it frequently made,
both before and during the war, and
not attempt the annexation of Man
churia or interference with Chinese
administration of. that territory. Fur- i
theremore,.the United States will insist I
that" Korea be restored to : the status
existing before the exigencies of war
compelled Japan â¢ to ; seize .the reins \u25a0of
government there. > ,
President Roosevelt has been criti
cised In some quarters for the seem
ingly partial, attitude: of the adminis
tration in ) favor: of Japan and against
Russia. The - writer., of , the * letter de
clares that the President. has put the
good faith of Japan to the, full test "and
assumes* that all , pledges made relative
to .the administrative * and territorial
entity of China will, be carried' out
Japan has been regarded "not as fight
ing for the conquest of territory, but to
prevent encroachments by Russia' upon
a district of the Far East which must
remain open to the commerce of all na
tions. '.

CHICAOO. May 3.â Rioting In the
streets to-day was so prolonged and of
so fierce a character that many- of the
leading business men have concluded
tkat there will be neither peace In the
city sor safety for outside interests un
til the State militia has been called out
â¢to restore order. A committee of mem
bers of the Employers* Association left
for Springfield to-day to confer ; with
! Governor Dineen and to request him to
order out the State troops. The labor
unions have an extensive lobby at the
State capital and it is likely they will
also, be heard before any action Is
taicen by the Governor, i Chief of Police j
O'Xfll says he is confident that he has
control of the biUzation and can keep
t pi?aee in 111* "el Cy~ "Despite \ the orders i
1 'of Mayor Dunne and the prohibition c
the City Council, many of the wagons
of the concerns against which strikes
nave been declared were handled to
day by men armed with xtfles and shot
The first rifle shot fired during the
â¢ strike went whizzing' through a crowd
ed tcoroughlare to-aay. The shot waa
fired by a gnard on a wagon of the
United States Express Company while
ft* Â»v passing through a crowd of
strike sympathizers at the intersection
â¢ of State and Randolph streets. In driv
ing past the corner the driver of the
Traeun reined his horses suddenly.' A
guard within the wagon poked his head
instantly from the wagon and, seeing a
street car conductor stooping as though
to throw a missile, pulled the trigger
without the slightest hesitation. No
iwis hie It developed later that the
conductor, who narrowly escaped death,
\u25a0Ras intent on his legitimate work of
'â¢throwing a switch."
The request of the employers, made
to-day, that th,e police be allowed .to '
ride on their wagons was declined by
the ChSef of Police. Positive orders
â¢rere published that under no circum
stances must the officers mount the
wagons. They will march beside the
vehicles. The order. Chief of Police
O'Ne;' explained, was simply intended
to ward off criticism. ?
RIFI.ES I.V FCMj VIEW.
One hundred and fifty wagons of the
seven express companies went to and
fro across the city to-day in many in
stances completely unguarded, and at
no time under the supervision of more
than one or two policemen. Every
\u25a0wa^on carried a guard, in some cases
aimed with rifles, and in others carry
ing heavy double-barreled .. shotguns.
The gncs were in plain view through
out the day and no attempt was made
to ixuerfere Vith any of the express
wagons.
The trucks of .the Scott ' Transfer
Company were guarded in the game
crasner. lien carrying rlftes were on
every wagon and around their waiste
\u25a0Â«ere belt* loaded with cartridges. The
company transacted its business as
though. there had been no strike.
Accession to the ranks of the team
tiers was made when a strike was de
clared against the coal firm of Carar
Â£linch & Co. This concern emploiV
several hundred men and delivers coal
to a large number of the most promi
nent of the buildings in the city. OnÂ«
of their employes was discharged for
refusing to make deliveries and the
rest walked out at ence.
Â°The gain of. the Employers* Associa
tion was made .when the members of
the Hay and Grain' Dealers' Associa
tion, which employs 12W teams, de
clared, that deliveries would be made
to any place in the city irrespective of
Ftrike conditions. If drivers refuse they
will, be discharged.
o MANY OUTSIDERS.^ CLUBBED.
The mobs that filled- the streets iv
tie business section to-day were larger
*nd ugiier than on. yesterday. There

downtown districts throughout the day
and over a dozen tiroes the police were
compelled to use their dubs and -the

these ruards, were not careful whom

were knocked down simply because

the case particularly in a fight near
the Majestic Hotel, when a number of
people, who had juct emerged from the
place, were charged upon by - private

BRIEF CITY NEWS,
Treasurer McDougald Lacks Amount
Â«..: Devoto Paid to Smith.
*The count Cf the money in the vaults
of the city treasury was completed by
\u25a0 the Grand Jury yesterday at noon in
the presence of Foreman Andrews,
Auditor Baehr, Treasurer McDougald,
District Attorney Byington, Supervis
or Brandenstein, chairman of the
Finance Committee; George B. Keane,
the Mayor's secretary; Officer Peter
Fanning and Edward O'Connor, repre
senting the Grand Jury and who has
been the custodian of the funds since
the count was commenced.
The amount on hand was found to
be $7,362,530 04 and was $15.559 40 short
of the amount called for by the vouch
ers and accounts of the office. The
last' sum named corresponds practically
to the check for $15,560 08, which Chief
Deputy Louis A. Devoto obligingly
cashed for defaulting Tax , Collector
Smith Just before the latter absconded.
The, odd 64 cents represents an excess
caused by equalizing the payments of
one and two cents on demands. There
was also a $20 gold piece over in one
of the sacks brought from some bank
. and a fifty -cent piece over in a sack
which came from the United Railroads,
- but these amounts did trot affect" the
final calculation.

meetings were those of .the" WilmeÂ»

It was decided to close the Wllmer
ding School term on June 23 and re
open about the middle of August. Di
rector Merrill reported so many appli
cations are being received from
would-be scholars that the " capacity
of the school will be seriously over
taxed. The work of construction of
the new school building is necessarily
slow, owing to the fact that it is be
ing erected by the scholars. The Iron
forge work will be re-established un
der the direction of Thomas \D.
Moore. ' The annual budget will be
presented at the board' meeting next
Tuesday.
The main feature of the Lick Ob
servatory committee meeting was con
sideration of the proposal of promi
nent capitalists of San Jose to build
an electric road ; between the ; Garden
City and Smith Creek, with a cable
road extension to the top of Mount
Hamilton. .. The proposed scenic .road
will cross a portion of the Lick-res

HOLBROOK. Ariz., May 3.â The wa
ter in the Little Colorado River, Is now
out of its banks and is rising slowly. It
is not known whether the main flood is
coming in a gradual swell or whether
.the wall of water from the burst
dams -is on its way down the valley to
the town. In the darkness to-night
and with no means of communication
with the upper river country it is im
possible to tell. â¢ v. :. :
Holbrook has been entirely ; deserted
to-night, people having left their homes
and climbed to the higher ground. A
special train loaded with household
goods and merchandise Is standing " on
the Santa Fe track at Holbrook ready
to poll out the moment the' water
threatens to Inundate the town. But
one life has. been lost so far as known,
that of a Mexican reported drowned at
St. Johns.
The farmers In the Little Colorado
River Valley have undoubtedly suffered
great financial loss from the flood wa
ters : and .the situation* may \u25a0be much
worse there * than " apprehended. ?'
; Hope Is entertained that the waters
will not reach the residence portion of
Holbrook," but â¢If the river continues : to
rise, even .slowly, there is 'no "doubt
that the business section of the town
will "be" flooded and perhaps ' washed
away. "Every precaution has been ta
ken to safeguard the Santa Fe prop
erty and it is so situated that unless the
force of the. flood __ is _ very great .but
small damage will 'ensue.'

FALLS VICTIM
OF BUNKO MEN
WINSLOW, Ariz., May 3.â The dam
at SL Johns gave way at 2 o'clock yes
terday afternoon and a great flood of
water is now coming down the Little
Colorado River. The water is reported
to be twenty feet high and a mile wide.
The dam was fifty feet high and back
ed water for eight miles and was a mile
wide and averaged a depth of twenty
five feet. The water was used to irri
gate a large body of land.
At-Holbrook, a hundred miles north
of St. Johns, great excitement prevails
and it is feared that the town will be
damaged. The Santa Fe sent fifty
freight cars to Holbrook, where the
merchants loaded their goods into the
cars. Every dam and every settlement
between Holbrook and St. Johns may
be swept away and a large number of
people rendered homeless. The break-
Ing of the St.' Johns' dam was caused
by the breaking of the dam at Greers,
forty miles south of St. Johns, caused
by rains and melting snow in, the
mountains.

- Acting under advice from District
Attorney Byington, Foreman Andrews
vlEited Smith's drug store and seized
eoxne papers In the Tax Collector's
desk. Among the documents were
found receipted bills for taxes which
the enTbezzler had collected and mls
epprpprfated. The tax bills of the
Bouthern Pacific Company and several
others on which the defaulter had
raised thousands of dollars were found.
The papers are now In the hands of

yesterday that the defaulter. Smith,
had a -box in the "Western National
Bank Company's vaults. A descent .
wi*-as made on this cache by Andrews, '\u25a0
Byington and Detective Tom Gibson.
Andrews believes that Smith has not

was nothing there but some private
papers, which were turned over to Ex- i

Presiding Judge Lawlor has assigned
the two cases against Smith, charging
him with felony embezzlement, to his

order that the cases be placed on his
calendar for Saturday for arraignment ;
of the defendant. As Detective Wren

LIST OF. KNOWN VICTIMS.
-A furious riot, which resulted in fatal
injuries J to, a non-union.; driver, >- took
place to-night ', : at ; the , i ; intersection of
Harrison : and Desplaines streets. ' A
% deli very wagon of ;the Fair, , a, large
department store, was attacked by a
crowd ; of jnen, 'who hurled bricks,
stones'* and bottles. The rain of mis
siles was so furious that in a few minu
tes : all the windows *;. in a ; saloon, in
frpnt of which the wagon passed, were
smashed. Two -. policemen, who were
escorting the wagon, drew their re-
Volvers, and firing into the group, drove
back , the crowd : until they could reach
the .wagon again. At Canal and Polk
streets'.;- a' union teamster drove his
truck across the way and blocked fur
ther, progress. ;\u25a0'-?. â¢ â¢
The; delivery wagon was then driven
into an alley and Chambers; the driver,
jumped and ran for his life. He dashed
into : a ; saloon on ; Polk : street, followed
by; a', mob. -He was refused shelter in
the v < saloon and I driven out into the
street > He then ran into a small shed
on the bank of the river, where he at
tempted to hide. , He . was I soon dis
covered and beaten into insensibility.
He was dragged to the roof of the shed
and the mob attempted to throw him
into : the river. 'It '\u25a0. was - unable, how
ever; to pitch him far enough and he
fell on i a pile of coal â¢on i the river's

nose was broken, his head cut' in many,

Foreman Andrews secured the per
sonal check of Smith for $15,590 08 from
Devoto after giving the latter a re
ceipt for it. The cheek will be used
in the prosecution' of Smith for em
bezzlement. .. . ..'".\u25a0 \u25a0-'\u25a0:\u25a0\u25a0:\u25a0
McDougald set about in the after
noon to raise the money, several of his
friends having come to his rescue. â¢- It
it understood that the full amount
.will be subscribed by to-day and
turned Into the city treasury. It is said
that James B. Smith, the brother of
the defaulter, has assured McDougald
that he will guarantee the payment of
the amount secured by the ex-Tax Col
lector from Devoto on false pretenses.
Foreman Andrews asked McDougald
if he contemplated making any changes
in the manner of . conducting the .af
fairs of the office. To this question
McDo-ugald replied:- - - \u25a0'\u25a0-- -- -â¢
"Hereafter iwe will make nq. pay
ments of money not authorized! by the
Auditor and sanctioned by the char
ter. That Is to say no more checks of
any kind will be cashed at our win
dows and even . money â¢â¢ will not be
changed."
Expert O'Connor said that the bal
ance of coin which should be on de
posit in the vaults was based on the
book accounts. O'Connor*. advised that
the books be experted for â¢ several
years back in order to ascertain If the
balance is correct. O'Connor also criti
cized the manner of cashing State war
rants for the University of California.
Supervisor Brandensteln stated that
the practice had been inaugurated with
the approval of the Finance Committee
for the purpose of saving the cost of
transporting the money to Sacramento,
which amounted to more than $1000
yearly. McDougald said that the cus
tom would be discontinued In view of
its irregularity.
While no reply waa made to __Mc-
Dougald's request for time, it was. tac
itly, agreed by the officials that his re
quest would be granted, although no
formal agreement was reached. The
request was considered reasonable In
view of the fact that-Devota had
handled $40,000,000 during the last three
years and were it not for the cash paid
on Smith's personal check the cash -on
hand would have been 64 cents . over.
The check is the one which Devoto ex
pected to receive silver for from the
United Railroads. â¢
bo in the clty'a vaults would be found there,
less the amount of the check for f 15,:.00 08, ha*
been Justified. I can only ask for your confi
dence and permission to retain the confidence
of the people. I would aek for a little time to
take up xkla check, and, I promise you that the
amount represented by the check will be In
these vaults in a very short time. â¢ . '

STOCKTON, May 3.â Becoming sud
denly Insane and murderous, William
Terry, a young man of Campo Secb.
planned to murder the aged father of
his friend, Arthur Fay.
Terry went to visit the Fays, vrho
live in a lonesome spot near the Venus
mine, . on , Monday and was invited to
stay for dinner. While the meal was
going on it was noticed that Terry ap
peared to talk and act strangely. \u25a0
Shortly, after dinner Terry took young
Fay aside and . told him that he had
come to kill his father. Terry was
armed and Fay was not. The latter
acted with rare presence of mind. He
told Terry that ' it - would be all right
for him to kill the old ; gentleman, but
that before he did it he desired Terry
to walk 'to Campo Seco .with ; hint : on
an errand. He said that there would
be plenty of time, after their return for
Terry to carry out his design.
Terry was easily persuaded by the
calm acquiescence with whlc^ young
Fay fell in with his plan and he readily Â«
accompanied him to town. Once there/
Fay lost no time in notifying Deputy
Sheriff :PickardÂ». and the . latter. at once
arrested and ironed Terry. . Later the -
Sheriff was communicated with and he
sent 'two deputies to remove Terry to
the county seat at San Andreas.

U}Â«! circumstances without any thought of the

..'Continuing:, Recorder Goff said:
Of course, gentlemen, you must not think
\u25a0that, because of the humble position of th!a
\u25a0woman, you should not give her the same con

The Recorder described the two de

the first and second degrees, which, he
â¢ said, he apprehended by the request to
Charge was thought by counsel to be
applicable In the case, and proceeded:
I understand that ther* U no claim on the
ran of thÂ« defense that U the defendant com
mitted this homlcld* it was either Justifiable
or excusable. I al*o understand that the de
\u25a0 tense claims that the crime was mnrder lv the
first degree or nothing. But you are not bound
*to accept the argument*" of counsel as to the
nature of this crime. Ton are the Judges of
the faejL if there was murder, and in what de
gree. The crucial question is: "Did the man
_ kill himself, or did thlÂ» defendant fire the fatal

If the accused falls to take- advantage of her
privilege to make a defense under advice cf
bÂ»r counsel, her failure to do so must in no

\u2666Â» The Recorder directed that questions
and answers of witnesses, which were
stricken out upon objection by counsel,
.must be disregarded.
Much has been said relating to the
motive which actuated this defendant.
The prosecution claims that she shot
ihe man because he had cast her off as
his mistress. Butt it. is not s necessary

must be proved, not Imagined. '

NEW YORK. May 4.â Having failed
to reach a verdict, and declaring that
â¢%hey were hopelessly disagreed, the Jur
crs 'in the "Nan" Patterson case were
'formally discharged at 2:20 o'clock this
morning.
At 1:30 o'clock this morning the jury
"was called into the courtroom by Re
corder Goff. When the twelve men
\u25a0were in their places and. the court of
- flci&ls had all arrived, the Recorder
&sked why the defendant had not been
brought into court. A deputy sheriff
replied that she had been feeling ill
end had retired, but was then being
dressed. After a wait of twelve min
utes, Miss Patterson appeared, looking
* pale and in a highly nervous state.
"Gentlemen, have you been able to
Teach an agreement?" asked the Re
corder of the jury.
"No, sir," replied the foreman.
"Is there any question of law. or evi
dence in which I can instruct you? Is
there any way in which the court can
help you?"
The foreman looked for an instant at
his fellow members .of the jury, then
I turned to the Recorder and said:
"No, sir; I don't believe you can help
ss."
' â¢ "Then you will retire to reconsider'
! the matter."
. MISS PATTERSON FAINTS.
The jury filed out and the courtroom
was cleared. Recorder Goff remained
In his chamber, ready to receive a ver
j diet, if rendered, or to further Instruct
the jury.
Miss Patterson collapsed on the jury's
I announcement and fainted dead away.
She was assisted from the courtroom
by one of her counsel and revived in
an> anteroom.
On the second return of the Jury Re
; corder Goff made a personal appeal to
' the foreman to endeavor again to reach
a verdict. The foreman entered, the
jury box and polled the jurors in the
I open court, but they were not able to
agTee. The Recorder then asked the
foreman if there was not some point in
law or something he could do by which
the jury might be able to reach a ver
dict, but the jurors remained steadfast
and finally declared their verdict a
disagreement.
Recorder Goff, before dismissing the
Jury, cautioned it not to tell how it
â¢Etood. It is understood that a majority
of the jurors were for acquittal, but in
\u25a0what proportion cannot be ascertained.
It has been Intimated by the District
Attorney's office that the State will not
attempt another trial. Miss Patterson
, TPill he released either on nominal bail
or und^r her own recognizance and the
Indictment eventually will be quashed.

LONDON, May 3.â The Earl of Dun
raven has written a remarkable
pamphlet entitled "The Crisis in Ire
landâAn Account of the Present Con
dition, With Suggestions for Reform,
in which he exhaustively reviews the
existing situation. The Earl says:
Ireland la at a crisis to ncr History. Tear by
year the country baa been ainktng deeper aad
deeper In misfortune and "has now reached a
point at which must be decided whether tae
dominant .tendencies shall continue to the in
evitable melancholy end or whether a supremo
effort shall be made to lift the country out of
the bankruptcy in man power. Intelligence
and material prosperity wnlcb so Immediately
threatens it.
Lord Dunraren says the land act
made a good beginning, but. that It is
not sufficient to save the country. HÂ»
adds: - N \u25a0 : . : ,
As a matter of fact, m thÂ« period of watch-
Ing the Internecine political strife in England,
the world overlooked < the cause* of the dlatreM
ful condition and haa sÂ«ea merely the quarrel*
of political parties.
He discusses at length .the existing
situation and insists that the British
Government,' if it desires to maintain
the union, must provide money for the
education of th* people ' and : gtre. the
country a measure of self-government,
which will the people an op
portunity to* appreciate their own gOod
qualities. He appeals to the moder
ates In Ireland to lay -aside -their dif
ferences and do something .for the
salvation 'of' the country. He says that
Ireland's best are continually drifting
out, while Its worst are drifting "to
ward lunatic asylums, and the remain
der "will remain In Ireland only by ne
cessity."
Lord Dunraven says the land ques
tion is now in course of settlement and
that the time possibly is coming; when
Nationalists and Unionists will work
together.
Lord Dunraven assails with' the ut
most bitterness the present system of
government In Ireland as a gross an
achronism which satisfies no one. . Ha
contends that the Irish are not lazy or
devoid of Intelligence and points . out
that they do good work and become
leaders of men In every quarter of the
globe. u:helr need at home, he says.

â¢which is right, and he is just as anx
ious that na injustice shall be done to
the railroads as he is that justice shall
-.cc done to the public. It Is gratifying:
to know that to-day there is less dis
crimination, fewer rebates and more
equality In freight rates than ever be
fore in the history of the country, j
"Bat through one device or another
there stllJ remain here and thsre
preferential rates which favor certain
large shippers and which ' bear down
unjustly on others. This is the condi
-tion of affairs that the President Ist
doing his best to remove. The pri
, vate shietrack arrangements, by which
unfairness in rates has been enjoyed
by some of the big industries of the
. country; the earning of more than a
fair return on private car Investments;
the payment of commissions of various
sorts or rebates on preferential rates
in any form, ought to be entirely dis
continued." vUI-t*
'. WASHINGTON, May 3.â The Amer
. lean Railway Appliance Exhibition was
formally Opened here to-day in the
prese&C* of nearly a thousand delegates
to the International Railway Congress.
Speeches were made by Secretary of
War Taft. Secretary" of the Ns.vy.Mor-
Aon, President George A- Post of the
exhibit, T. L. Lawrence, deputy chalr
â¢ man of the London Northwestern Rail
way, and Stuyvesant Fish, president of
the American section of the congress.
George Westinghduse, in accepting
the chairmanship of the exercises, pre
dicted a new era in. railroading by- the
substitution of electricity for steam In
the moving of trains. Secretary Taft
' ioilpwed. speaking in a humorous vein.
''Secretary Morton spoke in part os fol
. iews:
. * "The story of the transportation of
this country and the improvements in
.transportation facilities is the history
of American progress. It is no exag
geration to say that the prominent
commercial position of the . United
Slates in the world to-day is chietly on
account of its low railroad rates, -and
It is not at all out of the way for me to
say that if it were not for American
rail'vay appliances the cost of trans
. portatlon in this country would not be
to-day as cheap as it is. It has been
estimated that where one dollar
t has been invested in railroads, the
.value of agricultural property has been
increased ten dollars. The Bteel rail
and the steam engine, with all other
raUwtfy appliances, have been pioneers
-in the development of this country. To
day with great luxury and comfort and
.at^a cost of less than three cents a
mi:e, travelers accomplish in less than
one hour what sixty years ago was
tziare than a day's journey.
"The railroad freight rates in", the
United States axe low. No other coun
vtry has such cheap carrying of goods.
â¢ There are very few complaints of
rates in this country because they are
too high. Complaints of extortionate
rates are the exception, not the rule.
Rates are lower in the United States
than anywhere else in the world. They
â¢probably aggregate 40 per cent lower.
This alone is something to be proud of;
1 but, coupled with the fact that, with
the lowest rates in existence, the
' wages paid by American railroads to
"their, employes approximate at least
â¢ 6u per cent more than the wages paid
=. to railroad men in other countries, and
'.considered further with the fact that
'. .the American railroads probably pay
'higher prices for materials than other
railroads in the world, only serves to
emphasize the triumph in transporta
tion which has been achieved in
â¢Amerca.

Then they began to exchange mari

state of Mr. McLean's health brought
from Annie the declaration that she

divorced from that gentleman soon
after their union. "Nor do I care,"
she added, "whether he is well or

others againsf Thomas ]."Wallis' "of 'this
city and Robert D.' Grant .of -Salt" Lake
City to recover 5600.000, a s econd count
was put in by the plaintiff s ; in " the Su
perior Court, here *, to-day relating to
the transfer ;of the Parrot mine to the
Amalgamated Copper Company.' '
It appears from the papers that in
1559 Franklin Farrell owned 62,694
shares of the property. The holdings of
his family brought his total to 102.459
chares. The plaintiffs, it is said, agreed
with the defendants for the>sale of
these holdings at $50 a snare or as
much more as could be obtained. 'Ne
gotiations followed, it: is declared, be
tween the defendants and "William
Rockefeller or H. H. Rogers, or the
Amalgamated Copper Company." The
prospective purchasers demanded the
control of a majority before taking
the property. The members of the Far
rell family and the defendants secured
additional holdings sufficient to raise
their total to 115.719 shares, or a ma
jority of the 230,000 shares outstanding.
The holdings of the defendants were
then returned as sold at 540 a share,
the total received by the plaintiffs
being given as $4,628,760. The. plaintiffs
now claim that the defendants received
about $5,200,000 or,, about $600,000 more
than the amount returned.

directed Harry to it with another
young woman. : Then they drifted

Charles Can!!], who said he was a
bridgebuilder from Shasta County,
fared very well in the metropolis until
he attempted to play it low- down upon
the Chinese proprietor of a cigar store
on Dupont street. He dropped a nicke)
in a slot machine upon the counter,
pushed the button, brought up four
diamonds and a heart, shouted. "A
flush." and then quickly invested
other nickel and removed from view
the evidence of his effort to cheat.
Asiatic's eye was quicker than Mr.
Cahill's hand, however. A demand
for ten cigars, \ the scheduled reward
for dratrtng: a flush, was coldly re
jected, and when Mr. Cahill coarsely
pressed his claim the heathen had him
arrested for peace disturbance. At
the expiration of twenty-four hours he
will be at liberty to return to Shasta.
"Tou bet I won't," was the rejoind
er, "for I'm going right back to
Tuolumne."
"A further result is your dismissal,"
said his Honor, "and I hope you will
experience no more discourteous treat
ment while you are in town."
"I came down from Tuolumne to see
my sick brother in Oakland," . plain
tively he informed Judge Mogan, "and
finding him out of danger I crossed the
bay to look at the city, and this is the
result."
his beard -were in turn held up to ridi
cule by the youths, he explained. They
called him "Shdrty." hinted tha.t his
clothing had been purloined from a
scarecrow, pointed derisively at his
whiskers, stroked their chins and
bleated like goats.

Oakland Is the only city in the
world where an electric signal sent
from Washington at midnight will
ring the curfew bell exactly on time,
so it was decided that to-night, proba
bly for the only time in its history, the
curfew of Oakland should be rung
from Washington. The necessary con
nections were made by the City Elec
trician; and exactly on time the sig
nal from the capital tripped the re
lay and the bell boomed out the Gov
ernment signal.
OAKLAND, May 8. â The first
stroke of the big fire bell at the City
Hall, which announced 9 o'clock in
this city to-night also tolled the hour
of midnight in Washington, D.C., for
the bell was rung this evening by the
pressure of a key in the national cap
ital. The ringing of the curfew in
Oakland was a part of a test institut
ed by the Government officials to" dis
cover Just the ; length of time neces
sary for the passage of an electric
current around the world.

come to Professor Lincoln Hutchinson
of the University of California from the
United States Government. According
to an announcement made this morn
ing at President Wheeler's office. Pro
fessor Hutchinson, who for. a number
of years has been a member of the
staff of the College of Commerce, has
been appointed by the United States
Government special commissioner for
the study of the commercial relations
between the United States and the
South American â¢ countries.- He is to
spend the next nine months in the
southern hemisphere In these Investi
gations. He will then return to the
University of California to resume his
work in the department of commerce.
Professor Hutchinson Is now in the

gown was of, crepe de chine and each young
lady wore a wreath. in her'hair and . carried
an armful of flowers to match her dress. Miss
Florence White and Miss Marian Ooodfellow
were first, wearing palest green and -- carrying
maidenhair fern.- Miss Helen Chase and' Miss
Lucretla Burnham, *in delicate pink and all
carrying mignonette rcaes, followed, and after
them came Miss Anita Oliver and Miss Evelyn
Bliss in pale yellow and each with an armful
of . yellow iris. The soft violet tints of tho
gowns and iris bouquets of Miss Carolyn Oliver
and Miss -"Winifred Burdge completed the ra
diant rainbow of girls. â¢ .- >-.*Â»- â¢â¢: \u25a0 .

marvel of satin, princess lace and orange blos
soms, the waxen buds holding the 1 drapery of
lace to the long train and fastening the veil to
the bride's luxuriant Titian hair.' She : car
ried a shower of orchids.

ing by a â¢ jury \u25a0before' whom ' she , has

weeks! Twice before she has been de
clared Insane > and the occasion of t he

against her and has lived at home very

taken before the Probate. Court there

The architecture of four California
missions is represented in the four
wings of the California State building
at the Portland Exposition, which, as
completed, la pictured this morning.
Next month the exposition will be
opened. To be In readiness for the oc
casion work has been hastened on the
State structure. The dimensions are
200x200 feet. Since the original plans
were made by the architects. Dickey
& Reed, some modifications have been
suggested by Governor Pardee, and
these have been approved by the other
commissioners for California.
At St.. Louis, one >\u25a0 mission was em
bodied in the California building. The
mission architecture attracted so much
attention and proved to be so good an
advertisement for this State that it
\u25a0was decided to " increase the' mission
feature. Bach wing is characteristic.
The general effect is unique and strik
ing. The photograph is from a wash
drawing furnished by the architects.
California shrubs and flowers will
adorn the California grounds at Port
land.

The Butter Street Improvement Club, :
through Secretary Troy, â¢ yesterday re- j
I ceived a letter from J. Allen Baker,
chairman of the London County. Coun
cil Highways Committee, that has
charge of the municipal tramways. The
Information relates to the working of
the conduit system In London, and the
report of Mr. Baker to the London
County Council on the New York con
duit street railways.
Mr. Baker is not only chairman of
the most" important committee of the
London County Council, but he Is one
of the most distinguished engineers of
1 England, being a member of the firm
lof Joseph Baker & Sons. Limited, .
engineers, of London, Melbourne. Aus
tralia, and Brantford, Canada.
The letter is as follows:
LONDON, April 17, 1905.
, Dear Sir: Your letter ot , March 30, with
lcclosurea. Is duly to hand, and I note the In
terest you take in connection with Improved
methods of traction, and especially in connec
tion with the conduit system of electric tram
ways. I have asked our Ix>ndon County Coun
cil . officials to send you a copy of my , report '
on tramway 1 traction, and aoxna other matter '
that may be of interest to you. I also inclose i
herewith a further pamphlet or two. In which \u25a0
you may be interested. . .. |
"If any fact I s required to prove the economy I
of the conduit tramways, as compared with
cable. I think the fact that the Metropolitan
Traction Company of New. York, now amalga- '
mated Into the New York City Railways, con- |
verted their great system ' of cable on Broad
way and other New York streets to the electric
conduit, nothing but this latter system pre
vailing In that city should be sufficient. The
cable lines in New York were the moat expen
sive lines that hare ever been built in the
world, but the economy of the electric over the
cable was so great that it .paid the operating
company to make the change.
Here in London, where the Council are now
operating their iystem on the South Side, we
also converted a considerable length of cable
lcto conduit, and are earning more than double
the amount on the conduit that we previously
earned oa the cable lines. So successful have
our electric conduit tramways in South Lon
don, proved during the last two years that the'
London County Council is now about to pur- 1
chase the remaining portion of the company's
lease on the North Side of tfce Thames. This
lease waa granted nine years ago for a period !
of fourteen years, but the Council has come to j
ac agreement with the company Trherebv we
will take possession and immediately electrify
these lines that are worked by horse traction. ;
asd have one complete uniform ' system for the
â¢whole of our city., I- will send you our High- j
ways Committee's report upon this - matter <
and I think you may take it that the Council ]
will duly confirm this arrangement within the
course of the next few weeks. .
As to the success of . municipal tramways I
you are quit- justified in stating that in our .
great provincial citiesâ LJverpooJ Manchester
Glasgow. Leeds. \u25a0 Sheffield. Hull- and other \u25a0
places â they have - proved an unqualified sue- j
cess, giving a cheaper 1 service . to the public i
and being als* \u25a0 profitable to ' the ratepayers
(taxpayers). An ample reserve fund is pro- 1
x-lded for renewals and reconstruction, and be- |
sides a sinking fund.' as well as . Interest : on' j
capital. !\u25a0' always a first charge on revenue ac-'
count, the sinking fund providing - repayment ''
of the lines and plant within a period of twen- '
ty-flve years. London was behind some other j
large cities In municipalizing -Us ; tramways, '
but the success of the - last ' year or two has <
been such as to entirely justify our Countj j
Council's decision to follow the lead of otbei '
cities. .. ... \u25a0- - .. ' * \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 .\u25a0.\u25a0.-\u25a0..\u25a0\u25a0.,!
I am personally familiar with your - cable '
system of tramways In San Francisco, having j
observed them very closely during my visit to!
your city some years ago. \u25a0 No doubt at' the
time they were Installed. they were most suit
able and up to date, but great advances have
been . made since that time, and I think it . is
now universally acknowledged \u25a0 by all ' engineer- '
Ing experts that the cable system cannot live
beside the electric. , Edinburgh - adopted j ths
cable system,. but It baa been many times un
der discussion since then as . to' whether they
shctild ' not' be ; altered :to ' the conduit electric.
With the cable already laid . In', the streets It
should >be a comparatively inexpensive matter
to put ' in the electric conductors j and fittings,
acd so entirely reconstruct them. \u25a0 .;-. -*. . v>: v '-
I am astonished to note the enormous amount ]
per > capita that â your population spends In
street-railway fares per ; annum ($2O per cap
ita).-.'.:. \u25a0. - >- \u25a0\u25a0 -.- r.,- -..:, :/\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0-\u25a0 -
Any further . Information - 1 , can send . you I

The Spring Valley "Water Company
filed a voluminous printed complaint
yesterday In the United States Cir
cuit Court against the city and county
cf Â£an Francisco and the Board of Su
pervisors asking that the water ordi
nance adopted March IS of this year be
declared null and void and that the
authorities bÂ« restrained from enforc
ing it. "With the exception of the nec
essary new matter the complaint is a
copy of those filed In the same court
and now pending attacking the va
lidity of the ordinances flying the
water rates for 18C3-G4 and 1&04-05.
The present complaint alleges that
' under the new ordinance the dividends
of the ccr^pany for the fiscal year be
ginning JuJy 1, I&CS, and ending June
, 20. 1&06, "will not exceed 3 per cent
on a capital the same as the capital
â¢^of the grantor to complainant, namely,
*J1 4.000,000 â that is 3 per cent on one
half of the par value of the capital
stock of complainant, which capital
stocic is $28,000,000."
It is further alleged that if said or
\u25a0 dinance is enforced, plaintiff's gross in
*ome, after deducting operating ex
piinses and taxes, will be less than
.ti "3,000 and will be wholly insufficient
.to pay operating expenses of complain
â¢ .ant and taxes upon and in reference to
'property of complainant actually in use
In such supply, and any reasonable in
come or interest upon the actual value
of the property In actual use in sup
plying the city and county of San
Francisco and its inhabitants with
â¢ water, or any greater Income or inter
est* upon said actual value than the
rate cf. 1% per cent per annum, ac
cording to complainant's best infor
mation and belief.
Complaint further states that oper-
J fetlry? expenses for tfri ff year will be
JC55.300 and since the tax levy for ISO -
h Cs*more than $490,000 value has been
added tcr the property of the company,
wherefore the rates fixed by the last
ordinance do not allow the company
compensation for the taxes upon Its
property.
It is further alleged that not more
than seven of the eighteen members of
the* Board of Scperviscrs ever took
part at any raeetlng held for the pnr
pese of considering water raxes.
Complainant asserts that a fair and
"reasencbie value of the services of
complainant la supplying water during
the Csca.l year ISOS-06 will amount to
more -than $1,000,000, exclusive of taxes
and operating expenses and proper al
lowance for depredation of the slant
from natural causes resulting from Its
use. The actual present value of the
plant is alleged to be "in excess of
X5O,OOO,O0O." This is an increase of *10,
000,000 since the former fiscal year.
Judge Morrow fixed May 22 as the
dite for tha hearing.

TLK OBILIZATION is a cardinal art of war and Germany is
/y 1 more perfect in it than any other nation. If circumstances
\u25a0*\u25a0'*â¢ provoked a hasty, conflict with any other power, then most
probably all the advantages of the first, swift, strong blows would
lie with the Kaiser's army and navy. -What Germany may be
worth to us .as a model and a warning in that way is suggested in a
recently published paper written' by a member of the German gen
eral staff in which he tries to estimate his country's power to compel
American compliance inÂ« the emergency of a. commercial disagree
ment too serious to be settled by diplomacy.
The German strategist states that political friction with our
country, especially friction arising from commercial causes, has not
been lacking, and that these difficulties have mostly. been settled by
Germany's giving.way. He is counting the cost of Germany's wish
ing at some future time to quit, being, so obliging. He not only
measures Germanj's strength but reaches out to find our weak
nesses. . One of the first of: these he discovers is the small number
of American battleships which could be quickly concentrated for
defense;.^our navy being distributed, over two oceans and over 'long
distances. Next he finds our standing army almost nothing,^ and
our militia inefficiently armed and drilled and inadequate foK 'a
quick conflict with troops trained to machine-like precision- and
celerity. He realizes that America is too big and resourceful;' to be
conquered, therefore he would plan. success from Germariy'siclaimed
superlative skill in conducting large landing operations. By these
he would capture wealthy towns,' interrupt, commerce, levy 'heavy
contributions, destro) r buildings and take away alp material of war
and transport. " By ih.se mesri- he thinks so ' mti'ch inconvenience
could be caused that America would sue for peace. / ' .-
Americans will not be afraid of such menace, but â¢ at- ihe : same
time we must take notice that Germany, is. the only nation . which
could reasonably even so much as make threat of invading: the
United States. Great Britain, of course, could; if we did not prac
tically hold Canada as hostage. It is perhaps barely possible Uhat'
our lack of equality to Germany's preparedness: might cause us the
humiliation of temporary disasters. To avoid! that it is vvortH 'while

ANSWERS.
What is justice? It seems" not' to be
absolute, for it is variously-interpreted
by 'different: races andlpe^)les, accord
ing to their development." The;/J\vo
sexes interpret it differently." ; Women
may fail "in administering, man's 'jus
tice. But she can; render woman's jus
tice, and who shall . say-ids; any : the
May it not be true that^ these; qual
ities are necessary; ?in administering
justice and that justice ~[ is : not truly
justice unless it contains the feminine
element? - -. ; : : " : --" : -/\ /'. '\u25a0*
Why claim that woman's sympathies
and emotions: make her unjust?; Why
hot, say,; rather, that these traits
qualify [' her.: to render a still 1 broader,
deeper, j truer justice than' man's ? "
\ No matter * how strictly impartial a
man â¢ may," aim \u25a0to be: he certainly de
ceives -himself when he claims 'to is
sue a: verdict absolutely free from pre
judice. He i thinks to set aside every
faculty,, but his reason in making such
decision, and flatters himself. that rea
son * cannot "be partial. But even his
reasoning processes are governed -by.
habits "of^, mind "peculiar \u25a0to him." His
thinking follows ;the hent of ; his â¢ pre
judices,-1 say what he will. '
'Prejudice is something, /which enters
into the verj' war P, and / woof of . a
man's thinking â unconsciously to him
self perhaps. '
Despite the fact that every effort is
made to obviate this dangerâ as any
one can testify who has ' witnessed the
tedious process of impaneling a jury
it 'is impossible * to; determine whether
or.'riorpersonal" bias of : opinion enters
into the verdict. ' -
less equity because : it is woman's?
The argument seems to Le that man's
verdict ; is more trustworthy than^ wo
man's because a man can subordinate
his feelings to \u25a0 his reason. ' It is , im
plied that i his judgments^are always
impartial; How do we know this? Are
women's f emotions ' any ~ stronger than
men's prejudices?^ Who knows to what
extent the verdict of a juryman is col
ored by personal prejudice?;
In her qualities of -mind and heart
woman ,is supposed to be man's coun
terpartâhis' "direct .-opposite. *: ..Every
true woman has this , mother ; instinct
that yearns to -protect the weakf and
shield the unfortunate.
: But why argue that because woman
has deeper emotion and greater ten
derness than man, she , is incapable '\u25a0 of
being just? Because she possesses
characteristics ; directly * opposed' to
man's; .because she feeis compassion
when he . experiences none, and be
cause that "quality of mercy" which
"is not strained" enters into her de-;
cisions and is absent from his, does it
follow that she cannot mete out jus
tice as true as his?
ARE women unfair? Is a woman,
because of her sympathetic na
ture, incapable of rendering a ver
dict of equal judicial value to that
of-man? \u25a0 \u25a0 :: r \u25a0'ââ¢: ~ f *' \u25a0 "â¢"\u25a0 \u25a0
; I was much interested in what John
Oliver Hobbes (Mrs. Craigie) is report
ed to have said on this subject in a
debate before the Hardwicke society of
London. Mrs. Craigie's contention Is
that woman, by nature, is unfair,.be
cause the domination 6r her emotions
blinds her to justice; that she cannot
be impartial . in . her ; judgmerits_ and
hence is! not 'qualified^ to, sit on juries.
It may be, as^this noted. English
writer claims, that \u25a0women are (not
qualified 'tc- sit oil juries, under- the
laws thatl exist to-day. Women have
not made these laws, : and -no â¢ doubt
are out of sympathy with' many, of
them. . . *rv' : A .

The size of those connecting pipes
should^ also be sufficiently large to
coyer any, -future need. .There would
then; be ,no necessity for . tearing up
the streets, the surface of which be
ing once well and properly established
would remain so. The city would save
all , repair expenses and - the . property
owners would save the cost of cutting
the street for sewer connections."* j
The cost \ot putting in all the con
nections :at the . same time would be
less', than ; to - put : ,theni .in at different
times, and especially " so when done
before the street . is * paved. This sys
te mis in use in other " parts 'of the
country, even in small \u25a0 towns.
Water and gas pipes ought to be
fixed in the same way. All connec
tions should be made at -once to every
lot or* pair of : lots with ' pipes of suf
ficient sizes for* all possible service.
; In regard to water and gas pipes it
is an open \u25a0 question .whether . It would
not ; be as ; cheap and -\ preferable to
run- two lines "of pipes,, one on each
side' of > the street, and whether the
inside of the ' curb 'would not be the
proper place for -them." ,
'\u25a0': If such- pipes had been laid on each
side of : Market street we would have
now - a decent thoroughfare and ; lots
of money saved 'to the city.

..Why should not San : Francisco es
tablish pumping' stations and dis
! tribute its sewage on some cultivable
land where it could :be utilized the
same as is done In other cities?
Exhaustive studies on the subject
by practical and competent engineers
are accessible and could be consulted.
Whatever is to be done with the
sewage,' whether' emptied In the bay
or pumped and directed to some farm
land, the pipes ought to, be laid differ
ently from what they are now. .This
has no reference to the fall here .or
there, but to the fact that whenever
a connection is made from private
sewers to main sewers in the cener of
the street it is. now necessary to tear
the surface of the street and dig
trenches to lay : the new pipes. " The
.trenches are "never filled up solid 'and
!in r a; short time depressions from â¢ one
to several inches in depth are formed
over the said . trenches; sbmetiines
holes three or more feet deep are. pro
duced under the pavement by the
washing of the' sand and portions of

in disposing of the sewage In a proper
and up-to-date manner. -

fective -one "l that we now/ have : it is
timely: to study the question, and see
what had better. .be ; done in . that line.
'V;N6 ddubt;the City Engineer's office
has already* prepared full plans and

the i'city,; but as thejse \ plans have not
been submitted : to the public *we can
not' be blamed " f or ' being ignorant of

NEW SEWER SYSTEM:
OUR FRUITS ABROAD.
\ X /HILE we are analyzing imported wines, oil, glassed fruits
*â¢ \A/ and sausage. Europe is doing the same with our exported
V V products. This affects the dried fruits of California especially,
Vand has supplied Germany with a reason for their practical exclu
sion. The official promo'logical journal of Hungary at Budapest
\says: "The alertness of the Germans is doing everything to place
as many hindrances as possible on the German frontier to the ad
mission' of undesirable industrial and agricultural products. It is
especially attending to American dried fruits, which are often found
fault with, owing to their high content of sulphurous acid, due to
. "their strong exposure to sulphur. Lately the Crefeld Food In
â¢ spection Station reported that of forty-seven shipments of American
â¢â¢origin it had to reject thirty-seven for superfluous sulphurization,
because they exceeded the amount of sulphurous acid content li
censed by the Prussian Minister of Agriculture. This'is r instructive
/ *for us Hungarians, too, as American fruits are being sold here
â¢. which make a fine showing, but are less healthful."
United States Consul Brittain, at Kehe, Germany, in an of
ficial report, says: "I beg to call attention to an article which ap
; -peared in- the Journal d'Alsace of Strassburg. I have not been
* .able thus far to ascertain what steps have been taken to exclude
."'California evaporated fruits, but as the article has appeared in other
â¢;" n.ewspapers here I think it advisable to bring the matter to the at
tention of California producers, in order that they may prove the
falsity of such charges regarding the preparation of fruit' for the
â¢ German market. The following is a translation of the article in
question: The introduction into Germany of California dried
fniits.is to be forbidden. Prunes sent from California are frequently
soaked^ in a bath of alum and glycerine and in a red coloring matter,
,#, # which gives them weight but hardens the skin. The peaches and
" apricots are treated twice to a preparation of sulphur in order to
preserve the beautiful appearance of the fruit, and by this process
. .there is formed upon the skin of the fruit a residuum of sulphuric
jacid. which is very dangerous to the stomach/ "'"
United States Consul Baker at Sydney, New South Wales, Aus
â¢tralia. reports : "California fruits, apples, pears, grapes, oranges and
lemons are seen in the markets of Sydney throughout the but
\u2666â¢"especially in the winter months, beginning with May. American
\u2666" fruits are imported here, both green and preserved, and are gen
erally in excellent condition. The manner of packing California
â¢oranges, lemons and grapes is highly commended by the dealers, and
no improvement is suggested."
,"> The United States Consul General to Hungary, Mr. Chester, re
ports : "It is evident that there is a good market for American dried
fniits in Hungary so long as the German system is not adopted tiy
Hungarian competitors/
These reports, conflicting according to the locality from which
they come, are published for the instruction of California fruit
â¢growers. Sulphur is used on dried fruits as a bleach and also as a
â¢ * germicide. Fruit treated with its fumes is preserved, from insect
attack, and keeps longer as- a consequence. But there is a .'limit -to
the use of sulphur. It is used elsewhere than in California: We
"get sulphurous acid in imported wines. The French say that a true
â¢ sauterne wine must taste like a gun flint smells. We get the gun
flint taste of sulphur, but it is imparted by the French manipulator
- by sulphuring his wine.. The charge that other fruits are bathed
in alum and glycerine to increase their weight is new. We would
like to hear about it from some local experts. Alum and glycerine
. .cost more per pound than growers get for prunes. The weight they
add to the fruit, then, brings less than it costs. The profit in adul
. teration is in employing a cheap agent,' and getting for- it the price
.of a more valuable product.
As for the use of sulphur as a bleach and germicide, it is in
nocuous if the process is under due care. We, must learn' to adapt
our exports not only to the tastes of the distant market, but to the
law under which it exists. The German Minister of Agriculture
.permits the use of sulphur on dried fruits up to a certain harmless
percentage of sulphurous acid. There is no sorcery in finding out
v.-hat that percentage is and then taking care that it is not exceeded.
Of course many of the German regulations are intended to exclucK
imports without using tariff restrictions for tha^purpose. Germany
could always find trichinae in our pork products, though we were ex
f porting identical products to Great Britain and they were there gen
eralh' in use and proved to be harmless. To get entry for our pork
and other meat products into Germany the Agricultural Department
at Washington instituted an expert meat inspection service for the
safeguarding of exports. We have no doubt the department is at
the service of California fruit exporters for the same purpose, and
. for the instruction of our producers in the use of sulphur to con
form to the standard fixed by Germany.
Our producers are vitally interested in the matter, since it is
. apparent that more every season of our fruit crop is to be put into
more permanent form for export than its green state. We have the
â¢ finest fruits to dry and the best climate to dry them, and therefore
the finest dried fruits in the world, and it is highly necessary that
they be put above reproach and suspicion.

GATHERING OF SAN FRANCISCO'S
SCHOOL TEACHERS AT THEIR
ANNUAL, INSTITUTE.
"As the world grows older it grows
kinder," says Macaulay.
And it keeps on growing, kinder as
the years roll by. To-day "brotherly
love" stands for something tangible.
That's the spirit that's sprinkling our
cities with hospitals and settlements
and making the world a better place
to live in. -
Yesterday a "coterie of smart-set
women â and women whose lives are
busy as the busiest workingwomen's,
only along different lines â met at 312
Ninth street to properly launch the
new Settlement Home fitted up by
them, most of whom were members of
the Sti Ignatius .Training School. '
From 4 to 6 these women received
their friends, showing a pretty pride
in the new home, fresh and crisp and
cozy as your home or mine, madam,
every one of the eleven rooms -of . it.
And over it all presides a . matronâ a
sweet-faced .'wonian/ with a ' kindly,
voice â and a nurse whose soft- minis
trations will be called upon' early and
often by the poor of the district, who
can ill afford necessary attention and
advice. . . '- .
The St. Ignatius Training Association
Settlement House can hardly Sbe
classed as a new institution, having
held an existence for two years on
Harrison street, at Eighth, but it ia
new â delightfully newâ in its Ninth
street quarters, and delightfully com
fortable, as- you will say, if you see
them.
The following 'officers were busy tell
ing all about it yesterday to their,
friends, who were most enthusiastic
sympathizers in the good work: Mrs.
Walter Deane, president; Miss M. Mel
liss, vice president; Mrs. George A.
Crux, secretary; Miss Alice Butler,
treasurer; Miss Ethel Hager, head of
the sewing school; Miss Frances Mc-
Kinstry, - head of the cooking school;
Miss M. Melliss, manager of the
branch house. . . > '\u0084 .. . ., .â¢ * , \u25a0

This is the type of work that does
more to wipe out class hatred than all
the combined agencies in the . world,
bringing together the rich and; /the
poor, the served and the servitor on a
basis of mutual interest and kindliness
of spirit. And not of 'less, value -to the
State is the knowledge imparted in the
Settlement of the necessary arts of
clean living/ .
Tidy hearths, clean bodies and neat
clothes make for clean character. This
is what the Settlement teaches. That
is what the State needs.

the result of her experience in the

Miss Nesfield said in part:

They art all proficient Utere. I mean to have

there be a vislUng teacher present, all becom*
*JB. "dumb driven cattle"?
I know now aa never before it is. They
ere afraid of criticism.
.If we would have them talk we must not
criticize their effort*. With t&U Idea In view.
â¢ why not introduce a little eyvtem of conver
saUoos. not to be held formally at any cpeci
fied tIT-ac, but Just as often as we can work
' them la? I have tried it ana like the result*.
Tb*a when the children are willing- and
anxious to talk epoctaneoualy, rive them some
thins to talk about and let them talk on paper.
That ls> the secret of â¢writing:. When a child
realises that point and can do It, the hill la
climbed. . \u0084

it can be done.

' I believe that the seed ought to be planted

M. Doyle, supervisor of manual
training, spoke on "The Relation of
Special Training to Class Studies," In
the course or which he said:
. We are beginning to see that all things are
interdepended â nothing is of much value ex
vept as is is related to the whole. Studies are
well called branches, tor they have no life U
separated from the great trunk of truth.
We hare specialistc, but the beÂ«t of there
.fit and usily their work with the general
scheme of things. If they did not they would
effect but Mule, for teaching that has no
socializing Influence is mere parrot-work.
Turning to the actual work in the
manual training room, Doyle said:
The manual training room becomes a place
*t>f verifications. The pupil may find in it
,; woods from all parts of the world, and from
these te: infrmation never hinted at in the
.regular classroom. Or he may meet with
molded shapes whose just proportions 1 are the
gift of ancient Greece.
If so minded, he may examine a hatchet of
the Etone age. which required many days' labor
to produce, and taking it to hie work bench
compare: it with a blue tempered steel one,
which modern ekl'l offers him for a Â»ong, and
thereby com* Into a consciousness of his great
inheritance in having been born in such a
ccuntry and age. â¢
' Other subjects were reading, fairy
stories, and stories from pictures, kin
dergarten, writing and drawing, read
ing. Language, literature and , history.
In j the Girls* " High Scnool the ses
sions were most interesting and in the
discussion on "Languages" Dr. A. W.
Scott said that the modern languages
in high schools should be begun in
the first year and preferably In the
grammar school. He was of opin
ion that they should be taught, not
because of the foreign population, but
"for the benefit of American boys and
girls in order to remove that pro
vincialism of which Americans are ac
cused."
DR. DEAL SPIÂ£L\KS.
' The evening school's sessions were
held in the City Hall, the graded class
eeciion deliberating in Judge Graham's
court. D. W. Kratzer presided, and as
a chairman was eminently successful.
In opÂ«ning the programme." Kratzer
outlined the labors of the evening
echool, showing what the teachers ac
complish with pupils who come to theix
studies after a hard day's toil and not
with that freshness and vigor found
in thÂ« day school pupils. - â¢
It was a most interesting meeting.
H. C. Kinne in his demonstration of
the study of arithmetic added much
to the many excellent problems con
eiderpd.
_ Kinne was with John Swett thirty
yjfeare ago when the first night school
was inaugurated in San Francisco,
and he gave his colleague the greatest
credit for the initial step he took lv
creating the school.
Miss E. J. Onyon spoke, and was foi
lewed' by Dr. Louise B. Deal, whose
tbsme was "The Personnel of the
Evening School."
Dr. Deal's address was brilliant. It
proved, to be a graphic sketch of the
characteristics of the pupils. It em
braced anything from the bad boy to
the humorist, from the mediocre boy
to the dullard.
The address teemed with delightful

* A man does not count as wasted the
time tie spends In thinking over his
business^ but he seems loth to give
the same sort of careful attention to
himself and to his health.
And yet his business would be worth
. little without good health to care for
it. A business man tells how he. did
, himself good by carefully thinking over
his physical -condition, investigating to
find out what was needed, and then
changing to the right food.
"For some years I had been bothered
â¢ a great deal afv;r meals. My food
seemed to lay like lead In my stom-
ach, producing heaviness and: dullness
and sometimes positive pain. Of course,
Â° this rendered. me more or less unfit for
business and I made up ray mind that
c * something would have to be done.
"Reflection led me to - the conclusion
. that over -eating, . filling - the*; stomach
\u25a0with Indigestible food, waa responsible
for many of the ills that: human " flesh
endures, and that- I was punishing
myself in that wayâ that,, was -what
was making me so dull," heavy and
c uncomfortable and unfit for. business
after meals. 1 concluded to i try Grape-
Nuts food to see what it could. do for

"I have been using it for some
months now and am glad to '\u25a0 say that
it has given me entire relief. I do
not suffer any longer after, meals; my
food seems to assimilate easily and
perfectly and to do the work for which
(it was Intended. I have regained my
normal weight and find that business Is
a pleasure once moreâ can take L more
ta threat in it and my mind is clearer.

Mr. Sheldon has made a very profound im-
1 pression wherever he has made his talks, and, al-
though the address is to be. made primarily to
':\u25a0\u25a0< Sherman, Clay & Ca's employes, it will at the

TACOMA, May 2. â Luck favored the
Tigers and they made one run, enough
to win after two were' down in the
first round. Nordyke hit, stole second
and took third on Wilson's juggle of
a ball at the plate. Eagan was passed
purposely and Nordyke scored when
McLaughlln's drive to Wheeler bound
ed away. Eagan was thrown out trying
to tally. Singles by Sheehan and
Ea&an came in the sixth, but a double
play, Irwin to Gochnauer to Nealon,
prevented scoring.. The Seals had a
chance in .the fifth and ninth, bat
could not get the needed hit. In the
former round, Doyle's error on Hilde
brand'e was followed by Irwin'K safety.
Hogan, however, threw Hlldebrand
out at second. Xealon fouled out and
Wilson came in with a two-bagger.
With men on second and third, Goch
nauer was out at first. In the ninth
Waldron hit. but was forced at second
by Spencer,, who was caught trying to
steal. Wheeler was passed and Hilde
brand singled. Irwin could not hit
beyond Keefe and the side was out.

Honiton, the' honest daughter of Or
monde, ran '\u25a0â¢ up against . a bird of j rare
plumage in the mile- and a furlong
handicap yesterday at Oakland.
Packing all the excess baggage.pos
sible under the interstate ; commerce
law In the way of 120 pounds, she
was" of course installed favorite ; ; at
short odds, as Andrew. Mack declined
the issue. â¢
The great mare did all that was
asked of her, Minder taking her out
In i front from the 6tart. The --last
eighth of a mile C. Miller moved with"
Soufriere and the ; latter simply ran
over the favorite. On Saturday last,"
with the weights practically the same,
Soufriere finished .behind. Honiton In
a handicap, her price going fronr 15 to
20 to 1. ; Yesterday a hydraulic lifting
Jack would not have budged the 5 to 1
chalked up. If C. Miller will dupli
cate these two rides at the new; Bel
mont Park we will fortell what busi
ness he will , embark j in immediately
after. Elle ran third. ,
FIVE OUTSIDERS SCORE.
Only two of seven favorites reached
post in safety. The attendance was
large and the betting brisk.
By the narrowest of margins Met
lakatla. the favorite, beat Crigli a nose
for the opening seven-furlong selling
affair. Wright, who rode the first
choice, got away poorly, and the mare
had to be much the best to win. An
irad, a 50 to 1 shot, ran third.
Dell Fountain's mare Laura F. M. had
a pronounced call in : 'the betting on
the split of the seven-furlong run. She
was led almost from the start by
Funnyside, the second choice, which
was ridden out by more than a length.
Serenity ran third, four lengths be
hind the first choice.
Father Catchem, the 8 to 5 favorite,
made a runaway race of the two-year
old scramble at five furlongs. "Hand

place, a nose before F. W. Barr. Bl
Dinero wilted away after displaying an
abundance of early speed.
KELLY REDEEMS HJMSEL-F.
If "Handwrldlng" Kelly did scramble
the eggs with Cruzados Bon Tuesday,
he redeemed himself cy putting "Pos
sart across the line winner of the mile
and a furlong selling event. The black
horse received strong backing at odds
of IVt to 1 and met with all sorts of
111 luck. Last at one stage of the game,
it looked dark for Kelly and his mount.
Later on, at the head of the stretch, he
ran into a pocket and it seemed the
referee would { count . ten this time.
Kelly persevered, however, and, squeez
ing through on the rail, caught; By
ronerdale passing the paddock, scoring
by a length. Knapp, with the favorite,
Rey Dare, finished an indifferent third.
If there are any more at home. like
Rough Rider, they should never be
uncovered. The Los Angeles horse
went to the post f avorite ! f or, the mile
and a sixteenth selling fixture, tacked
on ' to last position and stayed there.
Lloyd Fountain, astride North ' West,'
early assumed the leading position and
disposed of Trapsetter handily 'at the
wire. Frank Sullivan" ' finished third
with Ocyrohe.
R. Taylor is not making rapid
strides as a Jockey. He had the leg
up on The Mist, favorite for the clos
ing five and a half furlong sprint, and
got left at the post. Lucrece, an 8
to 1 shot, ridden by Knapp, earned
a neck decision over Entre Nous,' a
40 to 1 shot. The show fell to Joe
Kelly.

.'The fans had their first look at the
190& collection of Angrels yesterday
afternoon at Recreation Park, and. in
cidentally, saw the southern stars stow
the Commuters away In an eleven
innins affair that was full of one-two
three-out plays. At that the finish was
'a hot one and easily the best part of
the game. Score: Los Ansreies 2.
Oakland 1. â¢ â¢ â
Neither team could hit the ball.
Host of the hits went to the pitchers
and the inflelders. A few flies came
the way of the outfielders, thouffh they
did not have any hard chances. A
high v.lrid was blowing:, but that did
aot affect the batting, for there was
none to be affected.
; An error by Kelly started the Angels
I on their trip to victory- Kelly fum
bled Bernard's drive in the eleventh
! with, two gone, and Flood immediately
grabbed bis club and walloped one to
right field, for two bases, settling the
1 fetrif e without further ceremony. Flood
tri<Â»d to steal home on the next ball
pitched and spiked Jimmy Byrnes, in j
th<? foot. Jimmy may be out of the
game for some days as a consequence.
â¢ Oakland should have won the game
a dozen times, for they surely did have
chances to throw to the birds. In the
â¢ ninth spasm the Commuters filled the
racks with no one out. Devereaux
forced Dunleavy at the pan on a hit
to Smith. Byrnes and Francks ex
pired through the medium of pop files.
"Oakland had eleven men left on the
bases, which tells plainly the story of
defeat - ...
V Southpaw Goodwin was wild and
Walked enough men to lose two ball
games in anybody's league. But the
Commuters never could do a thing
\u25a0when they got men on the bases. They
tried hit and run plays and every other
kind of an old play, but it was all the
same â nothing doing when a hit was
oeeded to break up the game.
Cap Dillon resorted to his old tac
tics of roasting the umpire again, and
Mr. Perrine chased the persistent
Angel leader to the bench in the eec
end round. Toman was brought into
the game, though he Is ill and in need
of a vacation. Brashear, who was do-
Ing stunts at short, came over and
covered the first bag from that time
on. The score:

RESULTS OP GAME.
ONE RUN BEATS THE SEALS.
SEATTLE, Hay 3.â lt was a pitch
ers' battle betwe"en Roach and Esslck
to-day and lasted fourteen innings.
Toungr Essick saw the game thrown
away by Van Buren, who tossed bad-,
ly to first to head off Dashwood.; This
fluke allowed Lefty Houtz to reach
the plate with the only. run of the af
.ternoon.
Roach and Essick dished up curves
that would satisfy any one. Neither
allowed more than one hit in any in
ning. Roach received the best sup
port rand the work of Houtz in left
field drove the fans wild. Three times
he robbed McLean of line smashes ;
that would have landed for extra ;
bases. Once he was backed against
the fence and took his chance, with i
one hand. Kane furnished several ;
sensational plays around third.
McCreedie tried hard to win the
game in the ninth, but the locals re
fused to err at a critical time. Burns i
made a fine one-hand stop of a hard
one by Gates and threw McLean out '
at the plate. Essick followed with
a hit to Burns and the side was out. i
Houtz opened the fourteenth with a
hit too hard for Essick to handle. A
sacrifice put him on second and he
scored when Van Buren tossed the;
ball away trying to put Dashwood out
at first. The score: \

NEW YORK, May 3.â With such
twin events as the fourteenth" renewal
'of, the 'rich Metropolitan handicap,
with ; $10,000 added, and "the opening of
'what . is . claimed to be the finest race
course '-. in : America,* to-morrow prorn
lsea to be a memorable day in the an
[nals, of 'American' -racing. Fully 50,000
people . are expected to throng the
course\when\ the : handicap 'candidates
are called to the post, and the initial
meeting- of the Westchester ' Racing
Association in its new $3,000,000 home.
Belmont Park, Is fairly under way.
; The Metropolitan handicap is at one
mile on 'the main track, and has a field
which is giving . the students of racing
a difficult task of selection. It is be
lieved:, to-night,: however, that the
James R.'Keene~ pair. Delhi and Syson
by, will be post favorites. Delhi has
worked faster than any of the candi
dates, it is said, and is smartly fancied.
Mr." Keene is said to have refused an
offer of $100,000 for Sysonby when a
two-year-old last year. August Bel
mont's Beldame, the champion filly of
last season. -is also named to go, and
will unquestionably be one of the
choices. The starters, jockies and prob
able odds for the Metropolitan, as in

TWO STAKES ATTRACT -V
HOUXDS AT UNION PARK
Eddie Smith of the Reliance Athlttle '
Club of Oakland, who will ref eroe the
fight in Woodward's Pavilion to-mor
i row night between Jimmy Britt and
Jabea White, will visit the English
: boxer to-day at his Larkspur training
I quarters. SESBSBm
He wants to have a thorough un
\u25a0 derstanding with the English boxer re
garding the conditions under which ne
will fight so that he may not be. at a
disadvantage in the ring. They will
discuss particularly the clause which
! provides that the boxers must protect
! themselves in the breakaways. -
The bickering of the promoters seems
to have dulled the interest of the fol
lowers of boxing in, the bout. Tickets
were placed on sale yesterday, but ths
demand for the pasteboards was llghi.
The expected $40,000 house has dwindled
down to one of smaller proportions. *A
fight of this kind usually attracts a
large. attendance from the country, but
the postponement has*had the effect of
creating a doubt as to whether the
fight .would be held. When this doubt -
exists the most enthusiastic hestate
to make the journey to tnis city. . -
If White defeats Britt he will have
the satisfaction of knowing that he met
the Calif ornian at the height of the
latter* s athletic development. He .is
stronger, and faster than. at any time
in his ring career. His intimates will
be surprised if he does not win inside
of five rounds. They do not think
.White can withstand his attacks once
he goes after him in earnest.
White spent a quiet day at his train
ing camp at "Smiling" Metzner*s Tav
ern. Larkspur, yesterday. The Briton
is doing Just enough work to keep in
health and to keep . within the weight
margin, 133 pounds. Before donning
his gymnasium clothes yesterday he
weighed 133^s pounds, but he disposed
of fully a pound while going through
his stunts.
Jabez, as usual, arose early and -took
an eight- mile walk. The Jog was dis
pensed with, as the Englishman's train
ers think he has done enough hard
work. A' brisk rubdown followed. In
the afternoon he punched the : bag,
tossed the medicine ball, wrestled,
pulled the weights and, contrary to

SACRAMENTO, May J. - Waltc
Howard, a well-known youhs resident,
was married .at noon to-day , to Miss
Blanche Coltoa, a handsome young
woman of Elk Grove. They werÂ« driven
to the depot this afternoon to tak* a
train. for San Francisco and were ac
companied by. the bridal party. â¢ At the
depot Howard met an old schoolmate
who begged. the chance to have a fare-
,well glass with him. While they were
exchanging amenities tne train drew
out ' with the bride. Â« It was too r late
for Howard to catch It. and he sent
messages to various points on the line
to stop her, but at last accounts he had
not overtaken her on her singular wed
ding Journey.
It takes an empty head tÂ». risa to
the heights of fashion.

When the \-irus of Contagious Blood Poison enters the blood it quickly con^
taminates every drop of that vital fluid, and every muscle, nerve, tissue and
bone becomes affected, and soon the foul symptoms of sore mouth and throat, ;

OVERALL GETS AWAY WITH
'/n ; - ANOTHER GAME FOR REDS
ALEXANDER RELINQUISHES
CONTROL OF < HYDE STOCK
\u25a0 The Italian flfth-class cruiser Um
bria, commanded by Captain Corel Ca
millo and manned by 240 swarthy blue
jackets, arrived here yesterday after
noon and dropped anchor off Folsom
street, where she has man-of-war row
all to hereelf. She will remain here
â¢ about three weeks, perhaps longer, and
- during htr stay will receive visitors on
board. The Uxnbria's arrival Is an
event of social importance to the local
Italian colony, as among the cruiser's
; officers are eeveral real noblemen.
â¢ The officers of the Umbria declare
that the cruiser's guns did not cause
the disastrous lire at San Jose de Guat
emala, but that the little old fleldpiece
with which Cabrera's representatives
. struggled to return the Umbria's sa
. iute was responsible for starting the
conflagration.
"As soon as she anchored off San
Jose the Umbria fired a national sa
lute as a mark of courtesy tp the head
of the republic in whose waters she
was visiting. The Umbria's salute was
rendered by a modern battery in proper
naval style. There was great excite
ment among the military ashore when
the Umbrla began to shoot. Uniforms
.were straightened, swords tracked on
and every available artillerist wakened
from his afternoon siesta and rushed
:to the cor&andancia. Kegs of powder
.were rolled out and shortly after the
last echo of the Umbria's twenty-first
sun had died away an ancient, muz
zle-loading, smooth bore fleldpiece,
â¢emitted a roar. Ten minutes later
"bans" went the fieldpiece again. An
other interval of from ten to fifteen
minutes and another explosion oc
curred. Four, five, b<t seven, eight,
nine, ten. Then came a long pause.
The Guatemalan soldiers had run short
-of wadding. Volunteers were called for
and parties of foragers sent forth to
seek rags, bags and other odds and
Â«n<ls to be rammed uown the throat of
tire fielduiece. Eleven, twelve. Tne
twelfth charge carried the bundle of
burning refuse which had done duty as
tradding to the comandancia roof, and
"when shot thirteen was fired the od
ds! residence of the comandante was
ablaze.
The saluting ceased and the weary
artillerists turned their attention to
'extinguishing the flames, which threat
ened to wipe San Jose de Guatemala
from the man. A force of bluejackets
was landed from the Umbria, and after
an hour's fight the flames were sub
dued. The comandancia was a heap of
asb.es, but the fleldpiece remained and
there was powder left. The Umbria's
.men returned to their vessel. ' The
artillerymen tackled the saiute again
and with a boom of triumph there
came from the muzzle of the fleldpiece
fourteen, fifteen and so on, right to
the bitter end. The gun was red hot,
the coxnasdancia had been converted
Into a heap of smoldering ashes, the
army was worn out. But the ameni
ties had been satisfied. - The salute of
the stranger- had been returned, gun
, for gun. and Guatemala's- reputation
-for courtesy was vindicated.
The Umbrla is a vessel of 2600 tons.
She is powerfully engined and has no
difficulty in attaining a, speed of eight
een knots. She is equipped with two
eix-inch guns, eight four-inch, sixteen
two-pounders and three Martniw. She
carries 260 men and fourteen officers.
Her officers are Captain Corsi Camilkt,
lieutenant Commander Cavalier Carlo
de Luca, Lieutenant Tonta, LJeuten

crole of the house of Prinz Forino;
Lieutenants Oricchia and Fongl, Sub-

-Or., May 3.â Armed
posses have surrounded - two robbers
near ;here, who this afternoon \u25a0in -a
daring ; manner.-,-, robbed the - bank of
Woodburn of $2000. The robbers on
entering ; the . bank covered Cashier
Poorman and Miss Gertrude Eddy, the
assistant cashier, 1 with revolvers and
demanded the funds of the -bank.
"While the ] demand was being complied
with one of the robbers stood guard,
,the other emptying the | money Into his
pockets as fast as it was handed over.
Having ! secured ; all the rdcney on . the
tables,' which amounted \u25a0to about $2000,
the; robbers then backed out of ihe
door, still keeping the cashier. and hla
assistant under cover.'. From the bank
they, ran' to the Southern Pacific Rail
road, close! by, and disappeared up the
track.; v-vl;; . /
Poorman, as soon as the 'robbers left
the bank,, sounded an alarm and In a
brief time almost the entire male popu
lation of the town â¢ had turned out en
masse. ' Possea were hurriedly formed
and,' armed with rifles belonging to the
local militia company, they started In
all directions- in search of the robbers.
Inside of an hour they, had the iwo
bandits located in Lonney's swamp,
Just" outside the city limits. Hurrted
calls ; were sent for \u25a0; posses which had
gone . in ; other directions, ' and the
swama was quickly surrounded on four
sides by large numbers of armed men.
Escape seems impossible. .
: NEWYORK, May 3.-f-One billion legs
cavorted to-day" through the hold of the
steamship Satsuma, carrying ten imll-,
Ãbnvwiggllng centipedes.^ The crew of
the vessel had been kept . from mutiny
only by the establishing of a centipede
watch,' during [ which a - Chinese killed
as many ; of :,the \u25a0 pests ' as possible and
drove \u25a0 others iback ; to i the - bales ; of . rat
tan^ and bundles jof hemp â¢ from which
they 'had \u25a0\u25a0; emerged;;;;; One python and
two â¢ monkeys are :on the roll '<- of : the
missing. "They .' Jumped into the sea to
escape the centipedes.
The Satsuma came >from 'Manila and
Tokohama, ; [but V it ; is ': believed I she did
not take aboard centipedes in any large
numbers until she r received a } consign
ment* of rattan at Singapore. She was
hardly out *of that l East Indian port
three days , .when ' the â first, centipede
came \up i through a ventilator. ; ,
,To ventilate . the" hold a hatch was
left : open and ,that very night centi
pedes came on deck and basked in the
moonlight. :"â¢ They sat by thousands on
the combing watching a company df
their fellows, dancing in .albewildering
tarantella movements to \ throbs of the
engines.' . V Â»
The Chinese, who had no , fear in his
heart, was sent to brush those centi
pedes away. At the pass of his broom
they formed Into a brigade -and while
a hundred ? or. so -'; covered the retreat
by making diversion in' the direction of
the bare feet of \ the Chinese, the others
leaped j into the hold. U The rear guard
then put; the hatches down and made
them prisoners. \u0084" :J.V.;^;

JCEW TORK. May 8. â The stock market
settled back to-day into dull trading and slug
gish price movement*, each as approached at
t'.tse* to stagnation. Transactions fell to a
smilltr aggregate than for any -full -day's
trading sine* the latt weÂ«k in March. Any
*ueh vj&lent disturbances as the fall In prices
which culminated rÂ«r Monday is almost certain
to be fpllowed by a series of demolishing fluc
tuations as prices seek tbelr normal level.
With the speculative factors out of the mar
ket the range of price became narrow and
thÂ« trarket Inert, offering little attraction for
operations by professionals who seek their
advantage entirely in the changes la the price
level. It was demonetrated pretty promptly
to-der that the upward movement of prices of
yesterday w;Â« but or.c of the oscillations In
cident to the subsidence of the speculation.
Â£tocks eerie open the market with some free
dom to-day and the ("eSnlte downward ten
dency established scattered the hopes of such
â¢pecu 'store at had been indications of a revival
of Â«peculatton ia yeeterday'e â¢movement. -ThÂ«
market caUsj fcr little comment and the news
of the dsy bearing on its movements was un
important. Men of }be day's business was
<Sone In the flrct hour and an unusually large
part of that wac for foreign account. There
was nothing in the general situation abroad to
account for this presstsr*. but it Â«v inti
mated thkt a considerable account in Ameri
cans wu bÂ«inr liquidated from Holland by
\u25a0way cf \u25a0; London. Tbe special pressure upon
Union Pacific and upon the United States Steel
etockf was of lane ctstlaental influence on
thÂ»> whole market. Much has beet) hoped from
the United Statrs Steel sharÂ«s to lead the
market in an expected revival of \u25a0 strength
&t>d their weakness was correspondingly V.it
eps>oir.t'r.jr. There were scattered points of
Â«trcr.rtli. but tht-Jr sympathetic effect on the
rccerfcl n-.trkfM was very sltjrht. Northern
Pacific was i-UFlvd up some reren points to well
above tbe nominal quotation prevalent for the
clock before the -Northern Securities dissolu
tion brought It bark to tbe stock exchange
list. Rumors were circulated that an In
crease in. the dividend was Intended. The vio
lent ad\-ar.ce seemed to intimidate rather thÂ»n
to help pentimrat. the market tradition re
specting thi* stock fosierir.K a nervous view'cf
Its inCuencc The price rubtequently fpn back
to a polst belcw last night. The market had
a weak closing, in which Union Pacific and

Cotton, Coffee and Copper.
Brokers' wires from the East yesterday said:
COTTON â To-day's cotton market was dull j
end fairly steady. This condition was due !
. tz*.ir.:y to the uncertainty of general traders
regarding the Immediate future course of
j/ricee. It le our opinion that it will be hard
to bull the market from the present level and
kotf the improvement without the aid of a
xruch better spot demand or more bad news
from tire South, en the crcp situation. More
money can be made by scalping than by taking
a gxÂ»rd position either way for the present.
COFFEE â Tee coffee market was quiet, bat
firm, to-day. The strength was due principally
to better foreign markets and continued mod
erate receipts. Ancther potent factor contrib
uting to the strength waa the preliminary fig
ures on he dÂ«-^reapÂ» In the world's visible for
the month of April. With the London and {
Antwerp reports missing the world's visible !
â¢nppjtjr showÃ a decrease of about 704,000 bags, j
T.-..F is about the largest mentbly decrease on
record. We thick the eituatlon and outlook
favorable to a gradually hardening market.
tr . 1 would rather favor purchases for a mod- :
crate turn on any further slumps.
COPPER â A traders' market was again in .
evidence to- day and stocks were sold steadily i
t.i day. causing a sharp break. Near the close â¢
Â«.n atrexnpt was made to advance the prices of i
Sha&ccn. but not much progress "ras made, i
ThÂ« rest cf the list waa dull. We repeat our
advice to sell stocks on rallies until we have
;ncre EatiaT&ctcry conditions cf affairs In the
New York market.
Conditions in Wall Street.'
The New Ycrk circular of Henry Clews says:
â¢"Hj* demand for securities from investors '
has been very largely satisfied by the heavy
Sotations cf tin last Â«!x months. Several -hun
dreds of millions of new bonds and stocks,
chiefly- the farmer, have been issued during
that p*nod; a eonsidera.ble proportion of this ;
amount or course being for refunding or
â¢ rSerrer purposes. Nevertheless, the new capi- â¢\u25a0
"i . commitrat-na for the past six months have' ,
beec exceptionally heavy, and the fact that i
.'-r;..Â»r iscues are in contemplation can hardly i
be regarded as a bullish argument, although I
it may r-osa'b'y oblige powerful \u25a0 bank
.:.jr interests to sxst&Jn the market in order to
*"T*l~* J H their flotation. - A rather, striking
illustration of the diminishing appetite for
bonds was shown in the low price of about 101
*t which $23,000,000 of New York city bonds
sold last week. This was a d'cllne of two
i-olnts, due entirely to overeupply. If in
verter* ere becoming indifferent to such high
class securities as these, how will they feel
toward other bends of a lees desirable Qual
ity ao long a* prices are maintained at such
an abnormally high level? â¢'
"The weakest niie of the situation seems
to be 6trfctly confined to the ctock market,
\u25a0which has overdiseounted all favorable condi
tions. General prospects continue favorable,
the crop situation being promising in spite of
the backwardness caused by cold weather. The
Industrial situation is also auspicious, la
r.e&rly ail resp*cts fully as satisfactory as dur
ing the boom period of two years aga. with
this difference^ â that prices are not so high.
and. therefore, more stable, while labor is
v. :. and profitably employed. Many of tha
tsdustrl&ls are reporting good earnings, and
ere likely to continue so doing for some
months ta come.
"The flnanrial situation abroad is also sat
isfactory, foreign markets being generally on
a sounder basis than for some months put
tr.c American securities steadily rising in fa
vor. The great increase in geld production in
Eouth Africa is also having a stimulating ef
fect. Our foreign trade shows a reviving
tendency, especially In exports, which In April
rose to $134,000,000. aa increase of "17.00'j.0'0
compared with lart year. This gain was al
xnoet equally divided between agricultural
products and tcanuf actsrers ; the latt*r a most
encouragir.g demonstration of our growing ca
pacity to enter Into competition with ether
cations In the world's markets. Our im
ports during April rose to $110,000,000. an
Increase of $19,000,000. which chiefly occurred
In food products &nu m material! for us? la
znar.cfcaturtsg, and Is, therefore, to be In
terpreted as an indication of home prosperity.
The foreign situation is. of coarse, stUI com.
r heated by the war between Russia and
Japan. --.. 7

| "Receipts of Hay continue to lessen, but 1750
tons have - arrived during \u25a0 the past \u25a0'week,"
about GOO tons lees than > for, , the week pre
ceding, i , This diminution has resulted -In a
eamewhat stronger feeling in the choicer,
grades of Hay for retail purposes, although
we still note a decidedly slow call for the me
dium and poorer grades. Many were predicting
very 'early arrivals for new crop Hay, . but : the
/ recent , rain will | probably prevent" anything
being shipped here until later - in , the month.
This season . the . volunteer .* will . constitute a
, very, small percentage of the crop.' but all re
ports -go â¢ to prove that a .large quantity of
i sown Hay will be ready for market | later ' on.
: "It - may -be well at this ; time . to bring *up
; the matter of- dtrt In Hay, which has caused

; during the past "few; years." The export -trade
. 'in Hay from San Francisco has been lncreas

shipped to great distances the presence of dirt

MEETING OF .SUPERIOR
> COURT JUDGES, CALLED
: City Attorney .Long yesterday filed
an opinion with the Board , of . Super
visors that the i petition'- of '\u25a0 the Direct
Line Telephone Company! for "permis
sion to â¢ install . underground" .wires in
the underground district and over
head wires outside, of l the district can
only be granted under^ the charter pro
vision r which provides' for the sale of
street railroad and other franchises.
Long says that there is no doubt that
the privilege requested would -be a
franchise and as such dependent for
its exercise upon a grant from the
municipality.- The opinion is Import
ant in' view of the installation of wires
by various companies, some of which
have no permit to do so. -
Says Franchise Is Required.
Mrs. Rosa. Tortaricl was arraigned in
Judge Lawlor's court yesterday on a
charge of murder in connection with
the killing of Biaggio Vilardo at her
home on April 5. During the arraign
ment she stood beside J. A. Splnetti.
her attorney, wiili a sullen look on her
face while ehe listened to the words
of the indictment &c translated by Vic
tor Demartini, court interpreter. She ]
pleaded not guilty.
. Attorney Spinetti said he was ready
for trial and would object to any con- |
ticuance. i
"Can you arrange a date for the trial
now?" asked the Judge.
"I think I can," replied SptnettL
"Any time â say ten days from now,
trill suit me."
The Judge said he would set the case
for trial on May 15 and Splnetti ob
jected to any continuance.
"You suggested ten days from now."
said the Judge, testily, "and as that
.â¢would be on Saturday, I have made it
'Monday. How can you object to &
continuance?" This ended the pro
ceedings.
The police, trill rely for a. conviction
chiefly upon the testimony of Joseph
Bertger, stepson of Torturlci's land
lady, and Mrs. Bertger. The young
man will testify that he saw Mrs. Tor
t urici seated upon the front steps of the
ibouse on the night of the murder while
he heard the noise of chopping from
â¢within. Ke \rtt! also testify that he
paw another man besides Torturid
leave the house after the choDDlne
noise had ceased. Mrs. Berterer Trill
.testify that on the morning after the
murder she saw Mrs. Torturici -washing:
bloodstained garments. .
The court declares that under any
circumstances the action of the â¢ Board
of Equalization in accepting arid ap
proving the revision legalized? the - en
tire proceeding. â¢ r -v> i r
It is asserted by Judge Angellotti.
who is the author of the opinion.^ that
while the Assessor's act was informal,
it did not violate 1 the provision- of the
law on which the' bank relied :' to re
cover the 55702 46. Justices Shaw and
Van Dyke directly concurred In. v the
Judgment of Judge Angellotti. ; The
other members of the court did not par
ticipate.
The Supreme Court decided ., yester
day that Assessor Dodge. had a right
to. correct a clerical error, ln the as
sessment roll after It had been turned
over to the Board of Supervisors sit
ting as a Board of Equalization. The
decision relieves the Savings and Loan
Society from the responsibility of look
ing out for the welfare of 55702 46 paid
as taxes under protest. .The judgment
rendered by JudgeSloss in the Superior
Court is sustained.
On the assessment roll the Savings
and Loan Society was credited with
the possession of 51,810,612 -.worth of
personal property. This amount was
subsequently reduced to , $1,270,312. It
was discovered at a later date that
bonds valued -at $642,944 were not as-
Bessable, and a corresponding reduc
tion In the corporation's tax was made.
The Savings and Loan* Society con
tended that the juggling of the assess
ment roll had rendered them legally
free from paying the tax on $349,814
listed as solvent credits. The Supreme
Court holds that ordinarily the Asses
sor lacks authority to make changes
in the assessment roll after. It has been
submitted to the Board of Supervisors.
In the present instance the error was
of a clerical nature.'.? r *? - - â¢-.'â¢-.\u25a0 -1
It is probable that Mrs. Heywood
may be well enough to continue her
testimony this morning, but If not a
continuance until* she regains her
strength will be ordered.
From the time of the separation Mrs.
Heywood is being carried along by the
lawyers. They arâ¬ demanding 'all of
the facts of the secret meetings, have
produced letters bearing on Mrs. Hey
wood's relations with her husband and
yesterday they, came down to the hour
of the sudden death of Mr. Heywood.
The story of the death and burial of
Mr. Heywood seemed to affect Mrs.
Heywood greatly and finally she gave
way. s .
For days past Mrs. Heywood has been
a witnees on her own behalf in the
contest between herself and her adopt
ed daughter, Agnes. Maud Heywood,
for a homestead on the late residence
of Franklin Heywood. The daughter
claims the right to the homestead on
the ground that Mrs. Heywood secured
a settlement from her husband under
articles of separation. Mrs. Heywood,
however, claims that shortly prior to
her husband's death there was a rec
onciliation between them and that fre
quently she visited her husband in
secret and he visited her likewise.
Mrs. Heywood was taKen into Judge
Kerrigan's chambers and there, under
the ministrations of a nurse, who has
been in constant attendance upon her,
Bhe soon revived sufficiently to be
taken home. During the afternoon it
was apparent that Mrs. Heywood was
far from well and once her nurse went
to the stand and administered a stimu
lant- Mrs. Heywood was unable to
bear the strain, however, and fainted
away.
Worn by days 'of rigid cross-exam
ination by skillful lawyers, Mrs. Agnes
B. Heywood, widow of the late capi
talist. Franklin Heywood, collapsed on
the stand In Judge Kerrigan's court
late yesterday afternoon. The hearing
came to an abrupt end without the
formality or an order for adjournment
and attorneys and court attaches hur
ried to the stricken woman's assist
ance.
