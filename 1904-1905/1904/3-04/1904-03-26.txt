fields that will rival the celebrated
wells at Baku and will cause the fa
mous fields in Texas to pale into in
significance have, according- to Captain
G. F. Dujay, been discovered in Mexico
on the Yucatan coast. He, in com-
I.any with a party of friends, including
Kirby Smith, were fishing on the Cam
peachy banks about a year ago, when
the odor of oil was noticed. Further
Investigation developed the fact that
there was three inches of oil on the
surface surrounding the boat. Oil
there could be seen bubbling up from
the bottom. Going into the interior
after landing the investigators found
a deposit of asphalt or sea wax. The
find was kept secret and concessions
upon 150,000 acres of the land was se
cured from the Mexican Government.
Negotiations were then opened and
several Mexican capitalists Interested,
with th<Â» result that two or three test
wells have proved all the owners an
ticipated.
Captain Dujay will establish a pipe
line to the coast and build a private
/sect of oil barges to market the prod
uct of the field.

It was explained that Major Bennis,
president of the Rialto company, had
become involved in the trouble grow
ing out of the operations of the Brooks
Brokerage Company and that part of
my duties were to defend him in any
criminal action that would be brought

BERLIN, March 25.â Rumors are current here that Baron yon ; Rosen, until lately Russian

from the Government. It is considered that he failed in his duty in not. reporting to: his Government

' WASHINGTON, March 25. â Count Cassini, the. Russian Embassador, to-day officially de
nied the authenticity of dispatches cabled from. the London Times purporting to be statements from
General Kuropatkin, the new Russian commander in the Far East: ' Th- Embassador strongly con
demned such dispatches as. false and designed to brew trouble. Especially .was his denial* directed at
tlie alleged statement of General Kuropatkin that Russia would not cease fighting until a peace treaty
was signed. The Embassador said: v : '
"This alleged statement in -which General Kuropatkin is quoted as -giving the- Russian plan of
campaign is absolutely false. â¢ Undoubtedly it was put' forward 'for Â¦- the^ purpose of giving the world
a bad impression of Russia's intention, especially as it, was preceded by another alleged . statement,
also false, in which General Kuropatkin is made to say that Russia' proposed to take Korea. This un
founded news is from the same source which alwaystrie'd with. great tenacity to. spread reports of a
character tending to adversely excite American public feeling. against; Russia.' I feel that the Ameri

Cruiser Squadron Is Ready
';Â¦; "to Enforce Payment
ol Indemnity. .
Information Concerning Contemplated
Move of Emperor Is Received by
Washington Officials.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. March 25.âInforma
tion has been received here, that three
German warships will appear at La
Guayra April 1, to back up with a
blockade if necessary the demand that
Venezuela make immediate payment of
the installment of indemnity fixed after
the blockade by the allies in 1903. A
German cruiser squadron consisting of
the Vlnela, Falke and Panther are now
lingering at Curacao, distant only a
few hours' run from the Venezuelan
coast. Inquiry based on these advices
elicited from the German Embassy
here a strong denial that such a policy
was in contemplation or would be
adopted. Nevertheless, a more tense
situation .exists in Caracas than at any
time since the troublous period Just
before Great Britain, Germany and
Italy, despairing of . gaining their
rights, ' entered up< n a campaign of
blockades and bombardments.
In the peace negotiations Mr. Bowen
recommended to the State Department
that Venezuela be called upon to guar
antee that at least $1,080,000 be set aside
annually from the customs revenues of
Puerto Cabello or La Guayra^ for the
payments at-.Tf.oijilxn^ pjalrna. J Failing
this he recommended that the United
States insist that tjft officials of the
â¢ Belgium Government take over the ad
ministration of the, customs revenues
from the Venezuelan authorities. In
the peace protocols it was provided that
the Belgium officials should do this if
the creditor nations were not satisfied
with Venezuela's effort at payment. A
cablegram received at the State De
â¢partmcnt to-day says:
"Payments of 30 per cent of the reve
nues of Puerto Cabello and La Guayra
for the first year amount to 5,084,577.5
bolivars, which is 313,422.5 bolivars less
than was estimated.
The estimated amount was 5,400.000
bolivars, or $1,050,000, which Mr. Bowen
has recommended now be insisted upon
as the minimum paid each year. The
reason for such prompt action on the
part of the United States is the neces
sity for remedying the .situation and
preventing the allies from taking more
forcible means to do so.

The committee of the House which
is investigating the charge against
Tiesuke Akiyama, a member of Par
liament, of . being in the pay of the
Russians did not conclude Its work to
day, but will probably make its re
port to-morrow. The proceedings have
beon in secret, but it is understood that
the testimony taken shows that 'Aki
yama had met General Kuropatkin and
members of the Russian legation at
various times, and an effort was made
to show that he had suddenly become
possessed of large sums of money.
Akiyama's supporters claim that his
meetings with the Russians were in
the ordinary course and entirely lacked
significance. They also deny that he
received any Russian money. The To
klo Mainichi, which published a de
famatory article defending Akiyama's
paper, is now being prosecuted.
ALLEGED TREASOX INQUIRY.
Referring to the result of the work
of Vjce Admiral Togo and his fleet,. M.
Yamiamoio tc-!d the House of Repre
sentatives that to blockade a port suc
cessfully the blockaders should be at
least twice as strong as the defenders
of the port. He said the latest reports
showed that the Russians had four
battleships, five cruisers and ten tor
pedo-boat destroyers afloat at this
time, from which it must be concluded
that the. work of repairing, at Port Ar
thur' was . being carried^forward' effi
ciently. The latest attack on Port Ar
thur, had enabled the Japanese to ob
serve the actual strength of the enemy
there.
Continuing, the Minister of Marine
said that while he hoped for a speedy
termination of the war, he must warn
the members of the House no-t to be
oversanguine. The united efforts of
Japan&spJdters and of civilians of high
and low degree, he concluded^ would
surely carry the war to a glorious and
successful -termination, v . k
In the course of his remarks the Min
ister", of Marine saidVit was no new
thing to be prepared 'for emergencies
in time of peace, but that since Jast
October the Japanese navy had been
under the necessity of increasing its
strength and had been constantly ready
for action oh account of the actions of
Russia. This the Minister regretted.
Continuing, he said it had been mani
fest to every observer that Russia had
constantly Increased her strength in
the Far East, and that if Japan had
not purchased the cruisers Nisshin and
Kasuga from Argentina her naval
strength would have been below that
of Russia.

ST. PETERSBURG. March 26.âCap
tain Irkoroff of the Manchurian com
missariat service, -who was arrested on
a charge of selling information in con
nection with the quartermaster's de
partment to the former military at
tache of the Japanese legation at St.
Petersburg, has been tried by court
martial and found guilty. He has been
sentenced to twenty-five years' penal
servitude.
It transpired that Captain IkrOTOff
had the most friendly relations with
M. Kurino. formerly Japanese Minister
to Russia, and with other members of
the Japanese legation, where the nego
tiations for the sale of the information
by the captain were conducted.
Captain Leontleff of the artillery,
who was arrested on the charge of
selling military secrets to Japan, was
employed at the 'Warsaw fortress. He
was arrested In the act of communi
cating plans of the Kovno and War
saw fortresses to Austria, similar to
the case of Colonel Grimm. It lÂ» be
lieved that Leontieff also supplied in
formation to the Japanese.
' The report concludes that, "in some
respects this bill is worse than any
pronounced subsidy measure which has
been advocated in Congress, because it
gives an absolute monopoly to a few
corporations and individuals who may
and probably will form a combine and
hold up the Government for all it will
stand."
TOKIO, March. 26.â A private tele
gram from Korea states that the Rus

four batteries of artillery have been
established . at Chyansyong.
The Russians are reported, to be ex
periencing great difficulty in transport
ing army supplies, particularly from
Llaoyang. The roads are in bad con
dition and it has been necessary to re
pair them and construct a number of
new bridges. Food is said to be scarce
and cattle are unavailable and the Rus
sians have been killing and eating
horses.

The colored lad could not reach his

Jack Burke and Joe Brown en
gaged in one of the fiercest battles
that was ever seen In the preliminary
class. As soon as the gong sounded
the men rushed at each other. They
did not duck nor clinch nor go
through any preliminary motions,
but simply got in and slugged.
When the first round was all but
over Burke landed an extra hard right
wallop on the other lad's jaw and he
"went to the carpet. He looked up
and then looked down. The carpet
appeared to be the most inviting place
so Brown stayed there.
His face was a mass of blood, his
ear was all but severed and his nose

hard wallops, but managed to keep

Harry Pollock, Corbett's manager,
bet $200 against $600 that Corbett
would knock Britt out in six rounds.
Britt placed $500 against $900 on
his own chances, while Corbett wag
ered $2500 against $1500 that he
would win.
The. betting on the Britt-Corbett
fight did not begin in earnest until the
day of the contest, when a flood of
money went in. 'The wagering opened
with Corbett a 7 to 10 choice. The
price went to 6 and to ZY S to 10. The
bulk of the money was wagered at the
latter figure.
There was considerable wagering on
the length of the fight. The betting
was chiefly at even money ' that Cor

Â¦ "When- the weighing was over the
spectators cheered Britt. Jimmy then
led the cheering for Corbett.
Both boxers said they were at
weight on Thursday night and that
they did. not work at all yesterday.
Corbett said this was the first time he
had weighed in so handily.
Britt went to his home to spend the
hours before the fight. Corbett went
to the Palace Hotel.
Corbett then stepped on. -He did not
wear his underclothes, a3 he expected
he would do. The bar did not move,
so the secret of Corbett's weight is
still a mystery.
To all inquirers he, said he never felt
better and his appearance bore out hi<*
statement. He shook hand3 cordially
with Young Corbett.
No time was lost, both boxers strip
ping for the test on the scales. Britt
was the first to try and the bar did
not waver.
When Britt and Corbett appeared at
Corbett's at 6 o'clock to weigh
In there was a crush of people anx'ous
to get a glimpse at the little fighters.
Young Corbett was the first to appear.
He dashed down Ellis street a full
half hour before the appointed time
for weighing.
He went at once to the scales and
tested them in various ways. tie
tried the balancing powers of the ma
chine and then stepped on the scales
in his street clothes. He seemed sat
isfied with the story the scales tohl.
To the surprise of the persons that
have watched him in training. Corbett
seemed to have aged noticeably in tho
previous twenty-four hours, /rhere
were deep lines of care in his face and
hla eyes had a dull look. The respon
sibility of the. occasion was apparent
ly resting heavily on all Corbett's ret-*
lnue. Trainer Tuthill. Tim McGrath
and Billy Otts all seemed to have a
weight of care on their shoulders.
Jimmy Britt arrived shortly before
6 o'clock, accompanied by his father
and Spider Kelly. He was in the most
cheerful spirits and his appearance
was In marked contrast to that of
Corbett. His face was wreathed in
smiles and showed no signs of bein^
drawn.

Referee, Eddie Graney Ls of the opinion .that .the best man .won. ; He said after the fight: "I gave the
decision to the man I thought did the fighting; Thnf was Britt.' He forccdit all the time and. never for a
moment did he cease. He battled like a true champion and I do not see why I should have called It a
draw. From the fifteenth round on Brltt did all the fighting. Corbett stalled throughout the fight and
was waiting for a chance to put in the nnishin=: blow. That chance never came, for Britt was as watch
ful as lie "as aggressive. Yes. Corbett had him going in the fifteenth, but every one knows that Britt
came right baek and fought like a tiger. It was tlio greatest battle I ever witnessed. Both boys showed
wonderful gameness. and grit. Corbett thought that one good punch would win him the fight. He waited
for a "chance to land it. He did land several, but Britt -stood them and was always ready with a fast
comeback. 1 believe in giving the decision to the fighter that forces the game and Is willing to take a
punch. Britt did this and therefore I declared him the victor, and I have no regrets.")

JAMES E. BRITT. THE GAME AND CLEVER 8AN FRANCISCO BOXER. WHO WAS GIVEN THE DECISION LAST NIGHT OVER
YOUNG CORBETT. THE HARD HITTING FEATHERWEIGHT CHAMPION, AFTER TWENTY ROUNDS OF THE FIERCEST
FIGHTING EVER WITNESSED IN THIS CITT.
Chief of Police Stanford and Leo Mc-
Cudden, Walter Jones and E. Brokar
were among those in'the building from
Vallejo.
In the delegation from Sacramento.
Frank Wright was about the only
Brltt fancier. Frank Ruhstaller, Geo.
Clark, A. P. Booth and Hiram John
son, the attorney, leaned toward
Young Corbett.
Otto Ziegler headed the visitors from
San Jose, most of whom strung their
coin on the chances of Young Corbett
also. Among the party were James
and Frank Kiernan. Sid Grauman.
Phil Herold and John Coole.
Bill Tilford came up a representative
of one from Hanford and must have
returned home overweight, for he was
a Britt man. Bill is one of the leading
sports of the southern town.
Al Vaughn came all the way from
Boise City, Idaho, to see the mill and
thought the Denver champion would
win in a walk.
During the morning, afternoon and
early hours of the evening a vast
throng stood in line awaiting the sale
of general admission tickets. By
nightfall the line had been augmented
by thousands. Street car traffic in
front of the pavilion was seriously
hampered by this line, which extended
for several blocks In either direction.
Mounted police and others on foot
were compelled to use their clubs un
sparingly In order to preserve anything
like order, and at times they were
swept aside like so much chaff before
the wind. Finally, when the rush had
subsided somewhat and the police had
stopped the sale of seats, it was esti
mated that as many persons had been
unable to gain admission to the audi
torium as were assembled within its
walls. ,^ v
While there were not so many strang
ers from afar at the ringside perhaps
as were attracted to town by the Jef
fries-Corbett contest, delegations were
present from Los Angeles, Portland.
Sacramento, Reno, Denver, Seattle and
other coast cities. The prowess of the
Denver lad appears- to have traveled
the country over, for nearly all of the
visitors brought along coin to unload
on Young Corbett.
From his home town, Denver, at least
fifteen crossed the mountains to see
the two boys shake hands. Ed Gay
lord, the well known turfman, wagered
several hundreds, and J. W. Casey,
the laundryman, held a stack of Cor

Corbett fancier, took the other end of
the betting at the price. Johnny Lyons
and "Little Henry" Friesenhausen
made up a pool of $1000 and placed it
on Britt at the track. Joe Harlan
doped the Denver boy to finish first.
Morris Rosendorn picked up a bet on

The Broadway Club made the following
book: 3 to 6 Corbett; 4 to 1 draw;

During " the minute's interval the
crowd cheered for Brltt in unison and
he came up for the next round fighting
like mad. For a time the two boxers
stood head to head, each landing on

off his guard once with a vicious left
and drove him back to the ropes. At
the end of the round Corbetfs defense
was gone, but still Britt could not stop
him.
Corbett came up for the last round

round.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, MARCH 2G, 1904.
Jimmy Brltt has nothing but praise and admiration for bis game
little opponent. After the fight be said: "Corbett Is a far better man
than I thought, yet I beat him fairly and squarely. I earned the de
cision by aggressiveness and gameness, for it was I who fought the
fight from the tap of the gong. True he hit me hard at times, yet I
was not affected by any of his blows, and I always came back will*
ing and ready to fight. I bumped against his forehead In the early
part of the fight and that is how I came by .this eye. Otherwise I am
uninjured. He was stalling and swinging wildly at me aft the time. I
kept away from him when I thought be looked dangerous and then
I closed in and did the leading. I never let up from the fifteenth
round on and had him going many times' till the end. Yes, I am
willing to meet Corbett again and I honestly think If we enter the
ring in a return match I can knock him out. I think I fought the
best fight of my career and although I hurt my right hand I stayed
right with It and never let up for a moment during the entire battle.
BRITT THINKS HE EARNED DECISION.
"I was robbed of my hard earned title by a man I thought was
my best friend," said Corbett between sobs. "I had Brltt beaten
â beaten to a pulp. He never stood a chance against , me and I will
leave it to. any fair minded man In the city that witnessed the fight.
I came hero a stranger. I have acted fairly and squarely and
like a gentleman in every fight, and for ray pains I am robbed and
cheated by Eddie Graney. I am willing to fight Brltt any time he
wants, winner to take all, and, furthermore, I will fight him for a
910,000 side bet. Britt's seconds had to carry him to his corner at
the end of the nineteenth round. He was all in. I have not a mark
on me and not one of his punches hurt me in the least. He is all
bruised and battered up and at the end of the fight he was so
far gone that he appeared delirious. I am as 6trons now as the
moment I entered the ring. I fought every minute of the time and
forced the fighting: in every round." Then the little fellow broke
down and sobbed as he realized that the title for which he bat
tled so hard had vanished, perhaps forever.

SITUATION AT TELLURIDE.
When Major Frank de L. Carrington
received his sudden orders to return to
Manila he muttered to himself: "Well,
the unexpected always happens."
Major Carrington came from the
Philippines" with the provisional bat
talion of.* scouts, with the expectancy
of taking them to the St.- Louis Expo
sition. He* was naturally greatly sur
prised when the orders came yester
day morning ordering him to sail back
by the transport Logan, which leaves
here on Tuesday. Why the Govern
ment wants him to return is a mystery
to the major and army officers in gen
eral. He had made all his arrange
ments for a summer campaign at St.
Louis, where he expected to give many
interesting and instructive drills. He
is very proud of the scouts and he has
occasion to be. He has worked long
and hard to get them up to their pres
ent degree of proficiency and natur
ally he is disappointed to think that
he will not be on the exposition
grounds to show the results of his
work while in the, islands. .It is pos
sible that the Wa'r Department may
think he has been so successful in his
work with his battalion that it may
want him to superintend the drilling
of others. At any rate, much to his
regret, he is going back to report to
the commanding general of the Philip
pine division.

After the performance, all societyâ

The concluding event, with Miss Lu
cie King driving Briscori and .Vermont;
Mrs. Ferdinand Stephenson; . Colonel
and Peacock; Miss Mabel Hogg, . Laddie
and Dandy, and Miss. Louise Stone,
Kleber and Harry, made a pretty finale
and displayed excellent judgment as
well as horsemanship. -*â¢-'. -^ ' *
Altogether, the affair was replete
with interest from start to finish.
The fourth number, hurdle jumping,
by six members of the Riding Club, was
the starting point where the chills
began. Miss Parrott, Miss Curlett, Mrs.
Ferdinand Stephenson, Miss Lucie
King, Miss Mabel Hogg and Mrs. "Wins
lbw. Anderson, in trig habit and derby
and setting well, rode round the ring
a few times to warm up their little
nags, and then things began to happen.
Over the hurdles In fine shape went
Miss Hogg, Mrs. Stephenson, Miss King
and Miss Parrott, but Mrs. Anderson's
pony had other plans, andipreferred to
let the others take the fences, and the
honors, but he later relented and went
over in fine style. . Mrs. Anderson's
horsemanship was remarkably clever,
inasmuch as her mount, was new to
her, she having lost her own horse re
cently.
But Miss Curlett made the sensation
of the evening when she fell as her
mount took the rail. His left knee bent
under him", and off she, 'went. ...For -a
moment no one breathed, but in a trice
up she jumped, ran to her pony, vaulted
into her saddle and was off â amid well
won cheers. Once more she tried the
bars, once more she was thrown; again
she mounted and again tried it, and â
over she went, clean and clear.
Miss Mabel Hogg did some "random
riding." What's that? Just what it
saysâ random. She drove Polo, Goldie
and Baby in tandem, three pretty little
nagsâ Goldie be^ng something of a
highstepper with a distant ; ear for
music, and preferring to do a two-step
to taking hurdles. But Miss Hogg put
himâ likewise his fellowsâ through their
paces In true hippodrome style, and
won fresh laurels. . ..
"When the men came on to ride over
obstacles used in the hunt, pink-coated
and suggestive of Blingum, they great
ly delighted the maids whose mounts
balked, because even the nimble nags
of the men balked, too. But here some
splendid work was done after the pon
ies had warmed up, "and understood
that their reputations were at stake
likewise the honor;, of their master,
Frank Carolanâ and took some five
foot obstructions without tapping a
hoof. " ",<,." 'â¢Â¦.-:
Then came the drill by the Mounted
Park Police, under command of the
gallant Sergeant James H. Helms, and
a more interesting feature could 'not
have been projected. The truth to tell,
the honors of the .drill were about
evenly divided between the officers and
the high-strung niounts. -What a
beauty that was that had the . honor
of bearing the commanding sergeant!
The "Jeu *de Barre" was then pre
sented by F.'J. Grace, Arthur Page and
A. L. Langerman, each of whom made
a; brave attempt to^ wrest the rosette
from the manly breast of the other,
but the time limit precluded a decision
-Ht was a draw (in the language of the
hour).
. "The. fleht a counter-card?" Well, a
good majority of the 1500 were com
posed of the fight-following sex â and
therein lies a pretty testimonial to the
D. Ds. And those chaps that yielded
up the allurements pf the fight were
amply repaid â aye, three-fold, for
stunts there were that sent chills up
and down your marrow, and a thump
under your ribsâ for thrice a maid
went down and thrice she leaped to her
saddle â and this but a sample thrill.
The first feature was a pretty parade
of men and maids ahorse, members and
friends of the San Francisco B.iding
Clubâ pretty, but tame as against the
later stunts.
t A toast to the Doctor's" Daughters!
And another to*the plucky maids that
rode! To be sure, there's something in
the way of toasts due the gallant
horsemen of the Wittman staff and to
the gentlemen riders that did some
perilous stunts on the tanbark. But
it was distinctly the feminine night to
shineâ and they shone. So did the dol
lars, as they piled high in gleeful con
fusion in the treasurer's cashbox.

GREAT GLOBE SHOWING.
All these figures will be displayed
conspicuously, with the routes of trav
el, on a half globe representing the
I northern hemisphere, upen which is de
i lineated the political and commercial
i geography of that part of the world
! that lies north of the equator. The
! ocean routes of sailing south of the
equator will lose practically all com
! mercial significance after the Panama
Â¦ canal is completed. The canal is 10
i degrees north of the equator. Ninety
| five per cent of the population of the
i world lives north of the equator and
j 98 per cent of the commerce generated
| by the industry of mankind originates
i north of 10 degrees north latitude, or
I noFth of the line of the Panama ,canal.
Since practically the entire human
family resides north of the equator, the
lines of commerce follow the parallels
of latitude. The lines of commercial
geography lie east and west upon the
commercial map of the world and are
deflected only by intervening objects. \
East and west commerce between the
Atlantic. and Pacific oceans has stood
charged with an unnatural detour
around. South America, comprising, as
will be demonstrated upon the globe

The distance "from New York to
Yokohama via the Suez canal is 13,

distance will be 9835 miles. Com

by using the Panama canal as against
the Suez canal route. The distance
from the west end of the Panama ca
nal to San Francisco will be 3277
miles and the distance from San Fran
cesco to Yokohama is 4356 miles. This
makes the total distance from the
west end of the Panama canal, to
Yokohama via San Francisco 7813
miles. The excess of the route via
San Francisco is but 153 miles from
the west end of the Panama canal to
Yokohama, as compared with the di
rect route from the west end of the
canal to Yokohama. The same small
excess of 163 miles by way of San

Hongkong from the west end of the
Panama canal, as compared with the
distance when San Francisco is left
out.

The distance from Hamburg to San

Straits of Magellan, will be 5559
miles. Liverpool, Hamburg and Bor
deaux sustain practically the same re
lation to San Francisco, as will appear
from the perusal of the figures given
in the foregoing.
A very remarkable showing relative
to the commercial position' of San
Francisco, in view of the construction
of the Panama canal and as related to
the Suez carial and all' established
routes of travel, has been' prepared by
the San Francisco display committee
for the San Francisco building at the
St. Louis Exposition. It will be told
to the people of the world assembled
at the great show that the Panama
canal will. cut. down the, distance by
sea from San Francisco to New York
from 13,090 miles to 5299 miles, a
saving of 7791 miles, and that the dis
tance from San Francisco to Liverpool
will be diminished by sea from 13,599
miles to Â£03,9 miles, a saving of 5560
miles. Xew York and San Francisco
are by the " carial brought closer to
gether by 7791 miles, while Liverpool
and San Francisco have the distance
lessened between them by only 5560
miles, a difference in favor of New
York of 2230 miles.

mander, has given instructions for the

at the theater or club or lodge meet
ings.
'PUEBLO, Colo., March 25.â John
Clark Jr., son of the Sheriff of Las
Animas County, in a statement to-day
regarding conditions in Trinidad said
there was an absolute necessity for
martial law, as the first outbreak of
trouble which has- been brewing would
put the situation beyond control of the
Sheriff's men. . .
Regarding statements that the strik
ers .are armed Clark said:
"Almost every striker in that district
is armed. They have not only pur
chased practically all the revolvers and
ammunition in Trinidad, but they have
been shipping in arms for several weeks
past."
It was. reported late this afternoon
that the troops have arrested several
men and captured 150 rifles and a quan
tity of dynamite from the strikers at
Segundo.

Nelson arrived a month ago from
Knnxviile. Napa County, where he
vork^d as a miner.
Snow was booked for robbery. He is
an athletic appearing negro with a bad
face. He lives at 926 Washington
street. He claims he just arrived in
town from Portland, where he says he
made a lot of money. He gave his occu
pation as that of a porter. Williams
denied that he was connected with
Snow in the robbery, but the police do
not believe his story. He lives at Polk
and Sutter streets.
The knife with which Snow had cut
Sergeant Ellis could not be found. It
Is believed by the police that he passed
it to his confederate, who gave the
name of Allen Williams, and that Will
iams hid it in the saloon where he was
arrested. "Williams had nothing in the
iray of incriminating evidence on ftfs
person, and his name was entered on
the detinue book pending an investiga
tion into his record.
The police had much difficulty in get
ting their prisoners to the central sta
tion. May Jones, a colored woman
Â¦with an unsavory reputation, interfered
and was arrested and booked for va
grancy.
and thence to Sutter, the 1 crowd the
while pursuing and crying "stop thief!"
In his flight Snow threw the watch
away and it was recovered by Nelson.
At the corner of Sutter and Stockton
streets Snow was captured by Police
lr.an Larkin, who had joined in the
thase. Bncw, when caught, attempted
to show fight, but was quickly subdued
by the patrolman.
As Snow was placed under arrest
another negro, who was pointed out to
Policeman Larkin as a pal of Snow,
broke and ran from the crowd. He was
pursued and caught by Policeman R.
Conmrs in Clarence Estelle's place, on
Barry street, a small alleyway off
Grant averue. near Bush street.
There was a large crowd on the cor
r.er at the time of the robbery, and
many, hearing Nelson's cry. pursued
the fleeing pickpocket up Kearny street
into Morton. Sergeant Ellis was stand
ing at the corner of Morton and Kearny
streets and grabbed the thief as he
passed. Snow drew a large dirk and
v.ith a vicious slash that reached the
arm of tho soldier compelled him to
release his hold. Snow continued his
fight up Morton street to Stockton
Nels C. Nelson, a miner residing at
633 Sacramento street, was standing at
the corner cf Geary and Kearny streets
at 6:45 o'clock last night, when James
Know, a negro, walked up and took
his stand beside him. Nelson Immedi
ately recognized Snow as the man who
ftole his, watch, valued at $25, on the
Â« vening of March 12.
"I watched him without letting him
know that I suspected what he was
poing to do," said the miner. "All of
a sudden he departed. Instinctively I
felt for my watch and found it gone.
1 knew where it had gone and imme
diately pave chase to the vanishing col
crt-d man."
Sergeant Frank Ellis of the Tenth
Infantry was badly slashed last night
by a fleeing pickpocket whom he sought

After terrorizing his family and neigh
bors who dared to venture near, the
man had finally run wild in the woods
only partially clad all the night before,
and although weakened by his violent
exertions and total abstinence from
food, it took the combined efforts of
three officers to bring him to town.
Bowers had been working near there
for five weeks and had been home but
a day or two when he became Insane.
He now labors under the hallucination
that he has murdered his entire family.
He was committed to an asylum. The
family, which is destitute, will be cared
for at Port Angeles.

iff Hopkins of Port 'Angeles, accom
panied by Customs Inspector. Fisher

rival they found that the Insane man
had been overpowered and bound by
the rescue party which had preceded
them by a few hours.

Ejwc'.aJ Dispatch to The Call
TACOMA, March 25.â Advices from
Nome say that during the early part of
this year an unusually large number
of mining claims were restaked by men
who are willing to thoroughly prospect
them. Most of the claims restaked
have not been represented or touched
since originally staked and recorded.
During the winter an enormous
amount of prospecting has been done
in the Nome and Solomon River dis
tricts, resulting in the finding of gold
in large areas where it was hitherto
unknown. This fact caused hundreds
of men wintering at Nome to search
records and locate as far as possible
every piece of ground remaining un
touched contiguous to claims, that are
showing good or fair, values.
It is. believed that spring will show
many surprises, causing early pros
pectors to regret that they permitted
their claims to lapse without investi
gating to determine their richness.
Some litigation will result, but as a
general rule the sympathy of the Nome
public will be with the hardy men who
have braved the rigors of the Arctic
winter 10 secure for themselves claims
which original locators passed by.
Special Dispatch to The Call,
XAPA, March 25.â William Williams,
who escaped from a gang of prison
ers on the streets a few days ago,
made another attempt to escape this
afternoon. He was shackled heavily
with a ball and chain and was work
ing under Guard Behrens on First
street. He was allowed to enter :i
yard tor a short time, where he was
attacked by a ferocious dog. The dog
made a rush at Behrens and Williams
climbed the fence. He dropped the
Iron ball, showing that It had been
broken or filed through before. This
was probably done at noon while Wil
liams was in jail. Behrens fired three
shots at the escaping man, driving him
under a house near by. Constable Al
len and Deputy Hotle were summoned
from the Sheriff's office and soon ar
rived. Williams was then located by
Allen and Behrens and escorted back
to Jail.
It is now thought by the officers that
Williams has committed some crime in
the East. He came from the East to
California a short time ago and is a
hard, scheming criminal.

As tsevitsble as the chan^af; seasons of
tne year is the change which comes to
every woman. Aad just as one anticipate*
the changes of other seasons it is wise to
anticipate this change of season and pre-
pare for it In this way the discomforts
cad disasters eaffered by many women at
the period of change can be avoided or
overcome.
Dr. Pierce's Farorite Prescription, a med-
icine for every season of woman's life, will
entirely meet the needs of women at this
period of change. It cares the physical
ills and relieves the mental anxiety and
depression usually associated with this
critical period. It tranquilizcs tht nerves,
encourages the appetite and induces re-
freshing sleep.

Question of Expenses of
Loubet's Visit to Rome
Rouses Ire of the Count
ATTACKS AXTI-PAPISTS
Minister Delcasse's Allu
sion to Russian Alliance
Causes Much Enthusiasm
PARIS. March 25.â Count Bon! de
Castellane (Republican) created a.
scene in the Chamber of Deputies to
day. When Foreign Minister Delcassc
asked for a credit of $90,000 to defray
the expenses of President Loubet'a
visit to Rome the Count said it was
understood that the President would
not visit the Pope and yet would visit
the representative of the dynasty who
had despoiled the papacy. M. Brisson,
President of the House, interrupted thft
speaker, declaring that his words were
an insult to the French nation. Amid
ereat disorder the Count continued
speaking. He asserted that M. Loubet's
visit was to be made tÂ«> a King who
owed his throne to Freemasonry. In
seeking the friendship of Italy, the
speaker added, France was sacrificing
the friendship of the Vatican. Several
Deputies replied to the Count.
M. Delcasse, in supporting the credit,
made a significant allusion to the 4
Franco-Russian alliance, which
brought out much enthusiasm. He said
M. Loubet's trio to Rome was another
evidence of the rapprochement be
tween nations which began with the
alliance with Russia and the faithful
continued maintenance of that alli
ance. This was the first allusion to
the Russian alliance since the begin
ning of the war in the Far East, and
in view of the efforts in some quarters
to weaken the alliance the statement
of the Minister for Foreign Affairs was
considered Important. â¢
The Foreign Minister did not reply
to the criticism of Count Bonl and the
credit was voted by an overwhelming
majority.

the Spanish regime in the Philippines
the parent was a Justice of the Su
preme Court. When Aguinaldo \ras at
the height of his success Buencamino
was his Secretary of State, but when
Aguinaldo rebelled against the United
States Buencamino chose to ally him
self with this Government. For his
loyalty he was chosen president of the

The latest development in the cases
of the eight students captured on
charter day morning is that none .of
them will be dismissed from the uni
versity. At first it was understood
that they would be summarily dis
missed and Professor Cory himself
said that the captives "might as well
pack their -trunks." Now there is an
entire change of front and the. charges
against the students will not be push
ed. â¢ Here is what Professor Cory said
to-day:
"The incident might be considered
as closed. The ends of the university
were served when the proposed rush
was prevented. The students will not
be dismissed, but placed on probation.
This change has been made necessary
because there is not enough evidence
to convict any of them of rushing."
E. J. Berringer, a sophomore, was
among those caught out by Professor
Cory Charter day morning. Berringer
was not in any way implicated in the
plan to rush, however, and is. not to
be classed among the eight offenders
who had been summoned to appear be
fore the affairs committee. It seems
that Berringer was returning home at
a late hour when the posse happened
upon him. Professor Cory was satis
fied with his explanation of his pres
ence on the streets and permitted him
to go without any admonition to j ap
pear before the committee. Berringer
taid to-night that he would be very
greatly surprised If he was called upon
for a further explanation.
"Yes, I was on the hill. I went
there to see that my class did not get
the worst of it with the sophomores.
I did not intend to rush, but if
'naughty-seven' was underneath^ I
would have helped. I had a knife on
my person to use in case they tied' me
up. When the policemen came I pull
ed the knife, thinking they were soph
omores. But when I saw they were
police I did not fight.
"I started to go up. the hill because
there were a lot of men fighting there.
1,, could .see them 'when they turned
the" searcThiight on them. I thought
they might be freshmen, and sopho
mores. But the police came before' I
got far."
Professor Cory let Buencamino go
after listening to his story, giving him
to understand that he would be need
ed on another occasion.
DISTINGUISHED SIUE.
Then Professor Cory took the
youth's name and some other data
and. told him to report to-day for a
hearing. Buencamino was on hand
on time, but he did not wilt before
the majesty of authority. No; he
made a clean breast of the whole
thing, concealing nothing. In sub
stance this is what he said:
But alas for Buencamino's dream of
glory! \rotes^jor Cory and his passe
of policemen were there to intercept
him. He was surrounded at the bot
tom of what might have been another
San Juan Hill and taken prisoner. The
handcuffs were clasped about his
wrists in a jiffy. There was nothing
for him but an ignominious surren
der. '
TKLJ^S HIS STORY.
BERKELEY. March 25. â The same
spirit of patriotism that prompted his
fathers and forefathers* to rebel
against the tyranny and usurpation of
the Spanish rulers in the Philippines
prompted Felipe Abren Buencamino,
a freshman at the University of Cali
fornia and son of an illustrious Fili
pino, to resent the measures taken by
the faculty to quell a rebellion against
the. constituted authorities on charter
day morning. This youthful patriot
went "forth into the night armed with
a jaclc!:nife : almost equivalent to a
bolo, his face turned a darker hue
with the aid of paint and prepared to
storm the heights of Charter Hill. The
fire of patriotism was all there. .He
would never let the * honor of
"naughty-seven" be dragged in the
dust by the guerrillas from "naughty
six." V

Thompson's vagaries are said to be
of a harmless nature, although Attor
ney Frsnk Parcells said that one day
Thompson did tell him. with an expres

while ho savs that a few mornings ago
he found his lawn covered with leap
year proposals. He imagined he knew
whom they came from from the fact
that he found a white bow on the lawn
and in explanation of this told a" story
of two pretty society girls dressed In
white and two in black.
!n this connection he said: "I was
v alking along the street the other day
ar.d, passing the Fore residence, saw
two laÂ«!ies sitting on the stoop dressed
in white. They were Miss lone and Na
thalie Fore. I did not think anything
about this, but whfn I turned the cor
ner vnd saw two other ladies feitting on
another stoop dressed in black l
thought it was strange, and the next
morning I found my lawn covered with
leap-year proposals.
"Well, 1 found a white bow on the
lawn, so I knew that Miss Fore. had left
the proposals, so I went then to call... I
sent in my card and went in, but they
did rot say anything, sol left."
Judge Ogden did not care about hear-
Jnir anything more. Thompson's family
1 hysician, Dr. E. M. Paterson, testified
in favor of his patient, but this evi
dence was all . urset by Thompson's
l'.ighty statements, and Judge Ogden
said it was only a case of where
Thompson should be sent. It was then
agreed to avoid the State institution by

re-fleeting the rays from an electric
light dov.n his chimney. Edward
Thompson, a scion of good English
family and wealthy in his own right,
proved himself a fit subject for an asy
lum to-day. His sister, Miss Lucy
Thompson, fcorroborated some of his
vagaries with an erratic story of having
Been people letting themselves down
from the nxtf of the Thompson house
by the "leetrio wires, and Judse Ogden
decided the sister was incompetent to

- It was agreed that his cousin, J. A.

out of bed at 3 o'clock in the morning

STCMPAGE RECOVERED IN
TIMBER CUTTING CONTEST
Judge de Haven Mulcts McKee, 3Iax
wcll and Others for More Than
Five Thousand Dollars.
Four suits brought by the United
States against persons for unlawfully
cutting and removing tanbark from
Government land were decided yes
terday by United States District Judge
de Haven in favor of the Government,
but for amounts less than those de
manded in the complaints. â¢
In the suit of the United States vs.
Frank A. McKee, Frank Wagner and
Calvin Stewart judgment was rendered
for $175 stumpage. In the suit of the
Government against â¢ McKee and
Pearley Maxwell judgment was given
for $2500 stumpage on 500 cords of
tanbark, with interest from September
30. 1901, and costs. In another suit
against McKee and Maxwell judgment
was rendered for $2500 stumpage on
tanbark cut on township 5 south,
range 2 east, iruHumboIdt County, to
gether with interest from September
30, 1900; and costs. In the suit
against McKee, Wagner, Stewart and
Charles Cooke the case against Wag
ner^was dismissed and Judgment ren
dered against the other defendants for
$38 50 stumpage on tanbark cut on
section 1, township 24 north, range
19 west, Mount Diablo meridian, in
Mendocino County.
Judge de Haven found that owing
to a misunderstanding about the boun
daries of the land the trespass by the
defendants was not willful and the
Government therefore was not entitled
to recover any more than the stump
age. â¢

ness, "and I'll tell him so to his face."
"Will you tell the man who knocked
your nose off that he lied?" t
The witness jumped from his chair,
doubled up his nsts and took one step
toward Knight. "Nobody can knock
my nose off my; face," he , shouted.
Knight lounged back in his chair and
watched the fun.
"Sit down," said. Judge Cook sternly.
"Take your seat," said Byington,
waving the fighting witness back to
his corner.
Judge Cook said the question of
Knight was improper, and this molli
fied the witness. During the remainder
of the cross-examination the witness
remained cool and Knight took care
not to stir him again.
David B. Green, the pharmacist who
claims to have sold a woman resembling
Mrs. Botkin two ounces of lump ar
senic on June 1, 1898, while he was
employed at the Star drug store, ,was
recalled to detail a conversation he had
with her at that time, regarding the
use to which she wished to put it.
This testimony was formerly declared
inadmissible by Judge Cook, but on
hearing the record of the cross-exam
ination be decided yesterday to admit
It. He warned the jury that if the
identification of the defendant by the
witness did not satisfy them that she
was the purchaser they must disregard
the testimony. Green said that the
purchaser stated that she wanted the
poison for bleaching either straw or a
straw hat.
Mrs.'Loretta Simpson, proprietress of
the Victoria Hotel In March, 1898, tes
tified to Dunnlng's presence In the
house for five days, at which time Mrs.
Botkin also roomed there. She tes
tified to their being together a great
deal and to the solicitude that Mrs.
Botkin expressed about Dunning when
he left for Cuba as a war correspond
ent. Mrs. Louise Â« Sceley also gave
some unimportant testimony along the
same lines and denied the authorship
or any knowledge of the anonymous
letters sent to Mrs. Dunning apprising
her of the relations existing between
Dunning and Mrs. Botkin.
. FINDS CANDY -SEAL.
W. TV. Barnes was au important but
uninteresting witness. He was clerk
at the Victoria Hotel in August, 189S,
when Mrs. Botkin left there. A month
later he was in the room formerly oc
cupied by her when .William Itosello
picked uv from the floor a. portion of
a seal ordinarily placed o_n fancy boxes
of candy at Haas & Son's shop. The
seal on the box received by Mrs. Dun
ning was missing and it is the theory
of the prosecution that it was torn
off by the defendant when she opened
the package to insert the poison in
the candy. A torn piece of paper with
handwriting on it was also found at
that time, but its* bearing on the case
has not yet been made important. The
cross-examination developed that be
tween the time of Mrs. Botkin's re
moval and the finding of the sealCap
tain Seymour, then & detective in the
Police Department, and Detective Ed
Gibson had visited the room two. or
three times and searched the effects
.left there by * t the defendant.
Joshua D. Deane;'husband of one of
the murdered wpptien, was recalled to
say that he had r partaken of . the fish
served on the night of August 9 at the
Pennington . home : "and suffered no ill
effects from' it: -His daughter, Mlfis
Leila Deane, testified that she did not
eat, any: of the fish, although she was
taken ill after eating one of the
candies. This was intended to explode
the ptomaine poisoning theory of the
defense. â
It was, during the examination , of
Joshua D. Deane that a row of great
proportions occurred between the con
tending counsel. â¢ Knight asked â¢ the
privilege of further cross-examination,
which was granted, and then inquired:
"On the morning you summoned Dr;
Bishop to attend your wife; what was
his condition as to sobriety?^

identify the box of candy in evidence
as that delivered into his custody by
Chief Lees, he answered ithat he could
not do so positively, but believed it to
be the same. Knight made a motion
to strike out the testimony of the wit
ness, which was temporarily denied by
Judge Cock, who announced that he
would make a permanent ruling on the
question at some later time.
STICKS TO STATEMENT.
Bernard J. McVey, the Delaware de
tective who brought the box of. poison
ed candy from the East, was next call
ed and said that to the best of his
knowledge and belief the chocolates
now in evidence were a portion of the
same he had secured from the Coroner
at Dover, Delaware. He also testified
that Professor Thomas Price, the local
chemist, took from the box seven pieces
of candy in his presence for the pur
pose of analyzing them. Knight tried to
make McVey admit that he could not
positively identify the candy as being
the tame he-fiad brought from Dela
ware, but the detective stuck to the
statement that to the best of his
knowfddge aha belief it was the same.
Professor Price was called, but before
he could give any evidence regarding
the result of his analyses of the candy
the defense interposed an abjection that
the bonbons had not been sufficiently
Identified as being the same received by
Mrs. Dunning at Dover. In support of
this objection Knight made a lonjg and
brilliant argument, during the course
of which he flatly charged that much
perjured testimony had been intro
duced by the prosecution in the matter
of the identification of the chocolates as
being those received by Mrs. Dunning.
He detailed at length the various
hands it had passed through since leav
ing the possession of the Delaware Cor
oner, and pointed out the many possi
bilities of substitution and being tam
pered with by the authorities had they
been so minded.
Attorney McGowan made the further
point that no corpus delicti had been
proved, inasmuch as it had not been
shown that Mrs. Dunning died of other
than natural causes. Judge Cook over
ruled this objection, but took under ad
visement the one made by Knight, and
Professor Price was excused until the
court can come to a decision.
TELLS OF ITS TRAVELS.
James W. Erwin, who was a postal
inspector In 1S98 and had familiarized
himself with the course of a package
mailed in this city for Dover, Dela
ware, gave a detailed account of the
manner of handling second, third and
fourth class matter In the local office
and the various routes it would take
and the number of times it would be
handled before it reached its destina
tion. He also said that presuming the
trains were on time a package leaving
this city on the evening of August 6
would reach Dover at 5:50 p. m. of
August 9. There is no date on the
postmark on the wrapper of the box
in evidence and the only decipher
able letters are "ran â co." From these
Erwln gave it as his opinion that the
package was mailed in San Francisco.
John E. Dunnigan, in August, 189S,
a distributing clerk In the Ferry post
office, remembered that in the early
part of that month he picked 15 up a
parcel similar in size and shape to the
box of candy in evidence, which was
addressed to Mrs. John P. Dunning,
Dover, Delaware. He was engaged in
making up Eastern fourth class mail
at the time. "His attention was par
ticularly called to the package because
of. the similarity to his own name and
by the further fact that he knew there
was a John P. Dunning connected with
the Associated Press in this city.
| In the latter part of the month Chief
of Police Lees, Inspector Erwln and
Detective McVey came to the post
office and Chief Lees threw upon a
table before the clerks a facsimile pack
age with the address photographed
from the original on it. The witness
said he tock one look at it and went
on sorting his mall. Detective McVey
came over to him and after some pre
liminary conversation witness informed
the detective concerning what he knew
of the package he had handled in the
early part of the month.
STARTS FOR KNIGHT.
On cross-examination - Knight asked
the witness if he had not told a fellow
clerk named Ford that he didn't know
anything about such a package.
"Did you get that from Ford?" quer
ied the witness, bridling up.
"Yes, I got that from Ford," said
Knight.
"Then Ford lied," sputtered the wit-
"Sir?" said Deane in a stagey voice
"He wants to â¢>â¢ know," interpolated)
Byington, "when you called in Dr>
Bishop to attend your poor, sick -wife,
whether he was drunk or not?"
"Certainly he was not," said Deane.
"Dr. ' Bishop is always sober. If he
had been drunk ;he would never have
got into my house. ! He is not a drink
ing man." ... , -;'
"That's all I wanted to know," said
Knight. "My question does not- carry
any insinuation or.cast^any aspersion
on the, gentleman. I asked it merely
to make certain of his condition."
"I desire to state to the court," said
Byington, "that if the counsel is not
prepared to present proof to back. such
a question that the asking of it is. a
cowardly and dirty piece of work."
Knight turned and looked steadfast
ly at Byington for a few seconds, with
a sneer on his face, and then blurted
out: "You are positively the littlest
piece of flesh that I ever knew."
Byington jumped to his. feet and
shouted: "I am bip enough- to meet
George A. Knight at any time and any
place, and, dojiU you forget itÂ»" -- â¢
A ripple of applause came from the
rear of the courtroom and Knight
walked away with a sneer. "He is
positively funny," he said.-
McGowan objected to Byington's re
marks about the question being
cowardly and Judge Cook rebuked the
District Attorney for his language, as
lending to prejudice the Jury, holding
that the cross-examination was proper.
At 4 o'clock the prosecution asked
for a recess, as it had no further wit
nesses. An adjournment was taken
until Monday morning at 10 o'clock.
There wai constant and bitter -wax
iarÂ© between thÂ© counsel for the pros
ecution and defense In the Botkin
trtAj yesterfiay. Mrs. Cordelia Botkin

the murder of Mrs. John P. Dunning.
Th<Â» defendant la accused of having
sent from this city to Dover, DeL. a
. bez of poisoned bonbons, some of
wÂ£.Ich Tnere eaten by Mrs. Dunning and
her lister, Mrs. De&ne, from the ef
fects of which they died In August.
1S98.
In addition to the encounters between
counsel there was a brief time during
the morning; session when Attorney
Knight, one of the defendant's attor
neys, was threatened with assault by
James E. Dunnigan, a witness whom
he was badgering. A peremptory or
der from Judge Cook to the witness to
take his seat and a pleading "high
sign" from District Attorney Bylng
tcn restored Dunnlgan's equanimity,
and he submitted to the remainder of
the cross-examination without further
outbreak.
During the afternoon session there
tvas a serious clash between Byington
and Kcight. The District Attorney
characterized one of Knlght'a Questions
â¢as "cowardly," and thÂ© latter told By-
Ington that he was "the smallest piece
of flesh he had ever eeen." Judge Cook
called the attorneys to order several
times, and finally secured peace.
. TWO I3fPOUTAVT WITNESSES.
' -The two most important witnesses
Â¦ eramined during the day were James
E.- Dunnigan and W. W. Barnes.

Short addresses favoring the pro
posed organization "were made on the
opening of the meeting by Messrs.
John : Swett, Sbarboro, Morgan, Rossi
and others. During the discussion much
attention was given to the two bill3
now before Congress affecting the Cali
fornia vlticulturists and wine makers,
both of which are known as the Hep
burn bills. One of these, the pure food
bill, has .the support of the men en
gaged ,in the industry in this State,
but the other, .which'aims to prohibit
the Importation of wines into any
State having prohibition laws, is op>
posed as being detrimental to the in
terests of California.
GOVERNMENT AIDS.
Close attention was given to the re
marks of Professor George C. Hus
mann, formerly of this State, but now
of Washington, D. C, who Is visiting
California on behalf of the viticultural
investigations of the Department of
Agriculture. He explained the work
of the nine experimental farms the
Government, has established in Cali
fornia. The three larger stations are at
Oakville; Xapa County, where all the
conditions affecting wine grape cul
ture are -studied: ait Fresno, where the
raisin Industry is especially investi
gated, and at Cucamonga. San Bernar
dino. County, where the department is
looking" into the possibilities of the
desert sections of the West. The six
smaller stations are scattered all over
the State, and on them tests and ex
periments are made of local conditions
in soil and climate. Professor Hus
mann will be present and address the
club this morning.
After appointing a committee on or
ganization and constitution, consisting
of Messrs. Twight, Towne, Wescott,
Pierce, Rossi and the chairman, the
club took a recess until 2 p. m. At
that hour the committee reported the
draft of a brief constitution, recom
mending that the club should not fol

organization that once spent two we'eks

amendments, the club adopted the
proposed constitution.* '. , Â¦
This provides that the name of the
organization shall be "the California

Sir Mortimer Durand, the new Brit

had a wonderfully varied and interest-
Ing career. From the time that he was
in India acting as a political agent
to Lord Roberts, witnessing the capit

the wheels of progress at Simla,
through all his diplomatic progress
there was never any doubt as to his
attaining the top of the tree. It Is
said that perhaps the only time in all
his life that he found himself discon
certed was once when he was a guest
of Queen Victoria, at Osborne and a
stock of unexceptionable cigars was
surreptitiously introduced into his
apartmentâ and he knew the Queen de

LEAP YEAR-D. M.. San Leandro,
Cal. If a year was made up exactly of
265H days we should have a leap year
even* four years regularly, but as there
is an excess of 11 minutes and 10.3
seconds every year, this excess la com
pensated for by dropping* the leap
year at the beginning of three out of
four centuries, thus equalizing the
time gained through the century. The
length of time thus established makes
an error of only one day In 3325 years.
No year is a leap year that is not di
visible by four without a remainder.
As the year 1830 cannot be divided by
four without a remainder, it was. not
a leao year.
PROPERTYâ E. L., City. If a man
marries and at the time of such mar
riage is possessed of property, it is his
separate property. Should he die pos-*
sessed cf such property and not leave a
will, the surviving wife would be en
titled to one-half if there are no chil
dren, and one-third if there are chil
dren. A divorced woman has no prop
erty rights in the separate property of;
the man who was her husband.
ANGELS' VISITSâ Nema. Pleasan
ton, Cal. "Like angels' visits, few and
far between," Is a line in Campbell's
"Pleasures of Hope." Blair, In "The
Grave," has "Like those of angela,
short and far between." Both writers,
however, appear to have borrowed
from John Norris. who died in 1711. He.
In "Transient Delights." has: 'Lika
angels' visits, short and bright."
Campbell was born 1777 and Blair in
1718.

A long list of places is on the itinerary. The fertile
Santa Clara Valley is one of the sections to be traversed
in/its entire lengtji by steam, and the new electric lines
will give a change to see its charming area at close range
and. to the best advantage. Every part of the Statetra
versed by the excursion will be found. to, possess its own
pecyliar,. charms. -The tour, from every , point of view,
should Drove to be a conspicuous success .. -.'â¢
THE coming excursion of the business men of San
Francisco, to^be made under the management of
the California Promotion Committee, to many
places in Southern California and in the central coast
counties, is admirably designed to give influential peo
ple a better understanding of the State. It is therefore
certain to result in good.
The Promotion Committee reasonably hopes that the
special train, which will leave San Francisco on April 6,
will be filled with those to whom invitations have been
extended. The copious rains have made the lands beau
tiful with verdure and have insured plentiful crops for
the year. The charms of scenery to be viewed en route
are manifold. The material progress that the several
communities to be visited can show and the promise of
advancement they possess will be a source of 'commen
datipji and legitimate pride.
With the sight-seeing goes the speech-making, inter
change of views, better acquaintance with men and meth
ods, acknowledgment and enjoyment of California
hospitality that is generously proffered in advance by
cities and towns through leading citizens, the realization
of. how great this State is in all its various sections and
how closely united .it- is by the common advantages of
in proximity 4o the sea, by its common climate,
by its removal by so many miles from the eastern centers
of population that its destiny is manifestly and peculiar
ly to be worked , out within its 'own borders and , by its
own patriotic and State loving people. These considera
tions are of importance aad their significance will not
be overlooked by the keen-eyed and sagacious men of
business and affairs from this city.
California is receiving greater advertising abroad than
ever before. The interest is consequently greater as its
attractions are made more generally known to the dwell
ers in ; less favored regions. At this time there are thou
sands of strangers in the southern part of the State,
who will be interested in the excursion, as it may afford
them for gaining much information. The
season is opportune and the reasons for the excursion are
many. ':< . ;.,

Ellen Thornycroft Fowler has writ
ten an article in an English journal
upon what she considers to* be the hu
mor of the midland counties of Eng
land. Says she: "The typical humor
of the midlands â like the typical scen
ery and character of the midlands â is
distinguished by common sense and
moderation; it avoids all excess or ex
tremes; it is essentially the humor of
the happy mean â the humor of the mid
dle way. It is shrewd without being
caustic, gay without being rowdy,
homely without being coarse. It is
merely humorâ humor pure and simple,
lacking alike the brilliance of wit and
the cruelty of satire; and because it
is humor, rather than wit or satire, it
Is difficult to define. Its Jokes have
an aroma rather than a point; its rep
artees an atmosphere rather than an
edge."
Then she gives the fc-llowing as an
example of pure midlands humor:
"First Polite Native â Who's im. Bill?
"Second Ditto â A stranger.
"First Ditto â 'Eave 'arf a brick 'at
Mm. then."
That must be a joke with an "aroma."

Dr. Arthur T. Piercy of Oakland is
authority for a story which possesses
an esthetic commingling of romance
and ghostly mystery. "While returning
home from a recent trip to the Sierra
Nevadas he was driving at dusk along
a wild mountain road during a thun
der storm. In the pauses of the storm
he suddenly distinguished the most
lugubrious sounds as of groans and
wild shrieks, which, with the swirling
rain and moaning wind, were most ap
palling. The doctor marveled much
at the unearthly noises, but putting
away visions of things unnatural, he
proceded to. investigate.. Following a
side ravine/ "'whence-- the' â¢noises
came, he t flnally arrived upon an old
mill, long since abandoned. It was
overgrown with wild ivy and erosion

below the picturesque wooden wheel.
The .recent storms had swollen the
water to a point far higher than usual
until it had at last reached the ancient
wheel, which, proud in its ability still
to do a turn, had again started and
was grinding its oilless way around at
the bidding of the rushing torrent,
shrieking out its delight at finding it
self once more of use in the world.

Many metals show symptoms of pois
oning, rendering them unfit for use.
Thus steel can by means of small quan
tities of hydrogen and- under certain
circumstances be very seriously affect
ed. Let us take two steel bars of the
same material, both heated to a red
heat, one surrounded by air, the other
exposed to the Influences of hydrogen
or hydrogen gas, chilling both bars in
water after heating; we shall find the
bar heated in hydrogen to be brittle,
whereas the other bar,' heated in air,
will turn out to be far superior. The
hydrogen has in this instance acted like
poison upon the heated steel, and very
small quantities of such poisonous mat
ter will suffice to produce very violent
effects. The disease in question can
be radically cured, it only being neces
sary to anneal the po-isoned bar, re
peating the process by heating exposed
to air. The poisoned steel, by being
allowed to lie for a long time, will with
out any further expert treatment, shovr
signs of Improvement to a certain de
gree, the poison gradually leaving it.
A better treatment still is boiling in
water c-r oil, which process may be
compared to using warm compresses in
the case of human beings.
Similar symptoms of poisoning,
caused by hydrogen or gases contain
ing hydrogen (as gas for lighting pur
poses), are apparent In cc-pper when
exposed to red heat. Not every kind of
copper is susceptible to this poisoning
in equal dejrree.
Metals can become diseased from im
proper treatment, as, for instance, cop
per and steel when exposed a certain
length of time to temperatures exceed
ing fixed limits. The copper in conse
quence loses a great part of its duc
tility and bending qualities. In steel
the disease can become so virulent that
a steel bar so infected can on falling
on trie ground break to pieces. The
technical expert calls such diseasa
"overheating." â Harper's Magazine.

During a period of jvars the cyanid- j
ing of gold-bearing sulphuivts has en- !
gaged the attention and enlisted the I
experiments of Professor S. B. Christy .j
of the College of Mining of the Dnl- '
versity of California. One of the lead
ing addresses to the miners was de
livered by him. There is continual i
discussion of the problem* attending
cyaniding, \vhiÂ»-h is one of the most
important operations connected with!
modern mining. In a general .way j
wh.it Professor Christy said was re- I
ported at the time of the convention.
There are certain definite averments
that, devoid of technicalities, have a j
claim to be considered as adding to!
popular interest, which are now pre
sented in official form.
One of Professor Christy's state- j
ments is that, "If this subject is given
the right kind of attention it will be
easily practicable to add to the annual
output of the California mines from >
55.000.000 to $6,000,000 a year, be
cause it will mean that a large num
ber of mines which now lie idle be
cause they contain just enough free
gold to pay expenses, will become pro
ducers and profitable producers as
well." This puts the matter clearly
within the line of a commercial propo
sition. The entire address being in
the annual report, it is available to all
who wish to learn what Professor
Christy has been able to accomplish
in experiments that have extended
through a period of six years.
In Professor Christy's opinion,
where there are produced from five to
ten tons of sulphurets a day and there
is water available for grinding, there
is no reason why sulphurets cannot be
treated when they are properly com
posed for favorable treatment, at a 1
cost of $5 per ton. Under favorable
conditions $25 material,, which in many I
cases does not pay now. might yield
a pront of $15 per ton ant possibly
more.
In the annual report of the Califor
nia Miners' Association -convention
there are also special papers by Mark
B. Kerr upon "The Storage of Waste
Waters for Mining Purposes"; by Ed

to make it valuable for general read

Xo obstacles *eem to be powerful I
*;nough to restrain the enterprise of
the Pacific Coast mining man. Me
chanical difficulties are overcome, re
gions far removed from, centers of
supplies turn from desert areas to
mining camps, extreme temperatures
ranging from the cold of the Arctic
circle to the heat of Death Valley are
cheerfully confronted; dangerous rap
ids are traversed, daily hardships are
encountered with a stoicism that is
aQmirable. Xo desert that is rich in
minerals nor any mountain range,
however precipitous or difficult of ac
cess, can retard the footsteps of the
# Kpld Keeker or the search for other
valuable metals. Towns are founded,
run their period of prosperity and,
tvhen the mines give out, unless they
'have other resources, decay. But the
miner ever pushes onward, tireless
and fearless. These remarks are
suggested by one of the latest towns
to be started. This is Camp Roch
â¢ ester In San Bernardino County, about
forty miles east of Daggett and eight
miles southwest of Ludlow station on
the Santa Fe Railway. Around Camp
Rochester are several groups of mine.?

The Czar has no civilization to impart to Eastern
Asia. Japan has. Which influence would the world
prefer, that of Russia or Japan? The question answers
itself. England holds a peculiar position in the struggle
by reason of her treaty with Japan. It is evident that
she prefers the position of umpire, rather than that
of a combatant, and will as long as possible hold her
self ready to tender good offices between the parties,
or to render them if asked.
The United- States will remain neutral as far as the
Government is concerned. Our moral power is great,
and will not be supplemented by our physical power.
â¢But, while this is the attitude of the Government, the
sympathy of all real Americans is with the representa
tive institutions of Japan and not with the bloody and
cruel autocracy of Russia. They are impressed by the
spectacle of the Mikado assembling the Parliament,
that he may have the advice of the immediate repre
sentatives of the people, while in Russia there is no
Parliament, the people have no voice, and what is there
called patriotism exists only among the ruling class,
with whom it is not love'of country ; in the sense of
making sacrifice" for it, but love of country because , it
can be made to sacrifice for them and pander to their
power and selfishness.
The Russia that would deserve the patriotic devotion
of the masses would not be' the country for the small
number who now control the empire and sap its re
sources for their own benefit. To them the conquest of
Eastern Asia means the adding of hundreds of millions
of burden bearers to produce by unrequited toil the
mqans of aggrandizement for the small number of aris
tocrats who rule Russia.
With such a programme Americans can have no
sympathy, no matter what appeals are made in *the
name of apocryphal services which Russia is saia to
have been ready to render during our civil war. The
real force that held England back in those days was
exerted by the famine smitten cotton spinners of Lan
cashirej who in the midst of hunger and privation,
caused by our embargo on cotton, refused to consent
that the Ministry should side with the Confederacy.
â¢They turned the scale, and if we are looking for those
who deserve gratitude it belongs to 'the starving men
of Manchester, who stood for human liberty in days
that were darker for them than for us. We owe a debt
to the representative Government of England, which
enabled the voice of her people to be heard in our behalf,
and none to the absolutism of Russia, the vast majority
of whose people were so steeped in ignorance that they
did not know that we had a civil war and that freedom
was at stake.
Intent upon that policy, which she has pursued in
violation of her promises to all' the Western nations,
Russia now demands that all the civil and military
oflicials of China now in Manchuria be withdrawn, on
the ground that it is necessary in order that Russia
may prosecute the war properly! The Czar has exactly
the same right to demand that Chinese civil and mili
tary oflicials be suspended, on the same ground, through
out the empire. It is a claim that Russia has the right
to use neutral territory for war purposes in a cam
paign of conquest and aggression. If she can so use
one province of China) .she can make the same use of
the whole empire.
The case is not analogous to the presence of Japan
in Korea. That is in pursuance of a treaty and by
the consent of Korea. If Russia had riiade her secret
treaty with China she could make the use of . Man
churia which she is now claiming. But in the absence
of such a treaty the demand is equivalent to a declara
tion of war against China, and a violation oF Chinese
neutrality.
What view the rest of Europe will take in the matter
it is impossible to foretell. Russia has gone courting
in every capital' on the Continent* and has sought to
Migar herself everywhere, except in Washington and
London. If continental Europe assent to all her de
mands, and- as a result she succeeds in effectuating her
policy in Eastern Asia, the continental statesmen of the
next generation will have occasion to regret the supine
ness of those of to-day. All of Russia's mo f ves are for
her own aggrandizement. They treat Russia as if that
empire were the whole world, and the scruples and
objections of others are not to be considered at all,
except by allaying them with diplomatic lies, or over
bearing them with force.
The attempt to raise the fears of the world by
about the yellow peril makes no impression
upon thoughtful people. The world has no fear of Asia.
It has seen in Jap'an what can be accomplished by the
assimilation of Western civilization. There a nation
has been regenerated in the brief space of thirty years.
The art and science of the world have received
and applied and Japanese scholars and scientific men
have shown themselves the equal of any. It is suffi
cient that Japan has made. more progress in civilization
in thirty j'ears than Russia has in a thousand. If civ
ilization mean progress, peace and strict regard for
the rights of others, absention from war until forced
into it by self-defense, and its prosecution without
brutality to non-combatants, Japan is the superior of
Russia.
IT is evident that Russia is determined to nag China
into an overt act. Indeed, Russia is pursuing a
course that makes non-action by China an excuse
for violating neutrality. Chinese civil administration
and sovereignty are over Manchuria. As we have
shown, our last treaty with China recognizes this. The
administrative entity - insisted upon by Secretary. Hay
extends to the province that Russia has been trying Â«to
grab. Probably had Japan not opened war this grab
would be complete by this time, and China have been
crowded out of Manchuria. :

The immediate neighborhood of

sites, etc., and still later the black oli
vine basalts, which, coming up through '
the volcanic vents, spread over many
square miles of the country. The In
dications are that the most recent
eruptions were of a quiet kind, in which
the lava rose in the craters and over
flowed, the molten rock extending in \
some instances ten or twelve miles i
from the craters. ' Later the cinder \
cones were built up about the vents!

" 'I didn't care whether I ever sold
another brick until I had got that
fellow far enough away from Crockett
so my pal could escape safely. It was
worth the weight of the brick in good
gold to lose that trick.' "
" 'See here,' he said to the steerer,
â¢what's the use of me buying that gold
bar. I'll just go back and choke that
thief's breath out, he's nearly dead
anyway. "We'll take the brick and no
body will be any the wiser.'
"Do you know that it was all I could

F.ormer Congressman Maguire is re

Trite as is the old phrase, "catching a

stronger force than to this tale.
"Down In Arizona I had a client who
was in Jail awaiting .trial for murder,"
says Maguire. "He told me the story
of hi3 life. It was alive with crime.
He had been a 'sure thing' man, gold
brick seller and all that sort of thing.
His "plan was to pick up a likely vic
tim, take him into the- country and
palm off a gilded brick for all the real
gold he could induce the patron to part
with.
"Once he went to Oakland, found
his man and won him with a yarn

wanted to get rid of 1L It was a bar

"The pair went out to Crockett, or
thereabouts.' In an old ramshackle hut

and gasping In the near reach of death,
apparently. From under the blankets
came the brick, . the hacking sufferer
painfully telling the story of the crime,

However, there are many more things, particularly
in. the field of high-class literature. As an instance there
is the fifth installment, made tip of four full pages, of
"To-morrow's Tangle," the brilliant California novel, by
Miss' Gcraldine, Bonner, the famous California writer,
which has suddenly gained such a tremendous vogue
that it cannot be procured at the libraries, even by
applying weeks in advance, while at the book stores it
will 'cost five times what it can be procured for in the
pages of the Sunday Call. Tt might be as well to mention
that it will be concluded 'on the following Sunday,
April 3.
In addition to all this there is the third story in the
series of deep-sea vagabond tales by Albert Sonnichsen,
who hasthe distinction of being the literary lion of the
hour in *New York just at present, entitled "The Vigi
lantes of the Silver Star." It is a true tale of our own
invasion of the Philippines and is as weirdly strange as
its name purports.
In splendid contrast is a sweet little Irish romance,
"Darby O'GUl and the Good People," by Herminie Tem
pleton, that will delight old and young alike; the
"Meows of a Kitty," and some "Fables for the Foolish,"
etc., etc., all making up a splendid modern magazine.
On the "Scrap Book Page," among many other catchy
items besides "A Catechism of Civics" and "The Ameri
can Girls," is a snapshot photograph, taken in the snow,
that is quite as remarkable in its way as the wonderful
leap of the woman it depicts sailing through the air
like a meteor for a distance of sixty feet. How she did
it and why makes one of the most fascinating features
of the Sunday Call to-morrow.
Commander J. D. Jerrold Keliey, U. S. N., in a special
article written for the Sunday Call to : morrow, that
America has .neither the requisite number of fighting,
ships nor the* concentration to meet any formidable ad
versary.
After all the notable additions that have recently been
made to our navy this startling condition of affairs f
sounds very exaggerated, but as Commander Keliey
further* points out not- one in ten thousand, knows the.
present distribution of our fleet, how it is subdivided
into squadrons, nor even where each squadron is at
present located, nor yet, what America would be likely
to do or could do in the event of becoming involved?
with any of the big powers, now watching so breathlessly
the developments in the Far East. In all of these de
tails Commander Kelley's article in the Sunday Call
to-morrow is nothing short of a revelation, though it is
more particularly important in its masterful expose of
what America is planning to do with her war ships â
no less a juggling of the various squadrons in a way
that will set the whole world thinking.
Quite as brilliant an article and one that is equally
pithy with news is a long dispatch that has just been
received by the Sunday Call from its special correspond
ent in the Orient, O." K. Davis, whio.h gives a thrilling
account of the -unprecedented difficulties and ironclad
regulations that the wily, taciturn Japanese military
authorities are heaping, upon the great army of foreign
correspondents now fuming impotently in.Tokio, while
the war is being carried on in the most exciting fashion,
entirely free from the keen eyes that might give the
rest of the world the graphic accounts it hungers for.
Still another timely article on a kindred topic gives
the official marching songs that have just been adopted
by the European armies. This isjndeed one of the most
interesting outgrowths of modern warfare.
These, of course, are only a few of the special features
in the Sunday Call, which artistically, will be very much
in the nature of a banner edition. Prominent among the
beautiful photographs is a full-page multiple color calen
dar picture of a perfect cherub of a child, making up
the central figure of a composition entitled "April Show
ers." Those who are saving these calendar pages each
month will have an artistic collection worthy of fram
ing at the end of the year.
Equally interesting as examples of modern photog
raphy, quite apart from the clever articles that accom
pany them, are the pictures of the "Cherry Blossom
Girl," a creature who will be not alone fascinating to
the men, and the pretty maid with the painted Easter
eggs who will attract men, women and children alike.

Governmental policies do not usuaJly involve
questions of morals or religious belief- and
besides, they are constantly changing-, old
policies giving way to new ones, to meet the
ever-changing conditions of tho country and
the people. The people are not so seriously
affected by policies which, for the time, may
be enforced by the party In power, as they
nupr be by an unwise and dishonest administra
tion of tho*e policies.
Our.* form -of government admits of quick
repeal of laws found to be unwise, and we
readily adjust our business to changes in the
laws when honestly administered. But for
corruptly enacted laws and a corrupt admln
iftratlon of laws we have but scant and tardy

ELECT MEN OP INTEGRITY.
There come times, too. when the methods
adopted to force a particular nomination are
so raw and tyrannical that loyal party men
are forced to reDudlate the candidate, though
worthy and well qualified, for the purpose of
rebuking the methods and asserting Independ
ence of the convention manipulators. A not
able Instance of this revolting spirit of a party
was the defeat or the Republican candidate
for Governor tn this State in 1894.
IVben a moral question arises which touches
the source and foundation ot government It
self, as did the slavery question In 185d it
may become a solemn duty to register a
protest, though for the time unavailing But
in most elections the voter Is called upon to
decide first as to general policies, and next as
to the men put forward to represent them; and
here often great embarrassment confronts him
The policies may be natiEfactory, but the man
who stands for them may be corrupt and
wholly unworthy. The question is too many
sided for discussion here. I believe, however
that all right-thinking men must conclude that
a party that puts forward such a candidate
absolves Ita followers from all obligations of
loyalty for the time and Justifies their bolting
the ticket.
In this eenso no nobler motive in civil life
can inspire the citizen than to become an
active politician, and that there is more or
less of odium attaching to the term politician
is due not Co the character of the political
dutita cast upon the citizen, but because he
has allowed the unworthy and Irresponsible to
have too wide an Influence In controlling polit
ical partlei.
APATHY OF CITIZEN'S.
This brings me to the point of stating that
righteous citizenship in the vote begins at the
primaries. It is idle to hope for the selection
of the btst men for office as a rule unless
good men are chosen to select the candidates.
KiKhteous citizenship In the vote requires,
under our syetem. the presence and active In
nuene-e of every good citizen at the primaries,
and. where delegates to nominating conven
tion* are otherwise chosen, the good citizen
should attend and make his Influence felt in
thus selecting the delegates.
I am speaking to business men who as a
class affect to. If in fact they do not dislike
politics and professional politicians and who
indulge a pronounced contempt for the eo
called political boss. They have great civic
pride and a high conception of civic duty and
yet they commit the management of cam
paigns to men they most distrust and too
often neglect the first obligation of the citizen
which Is to purify and keep purified the foun
tain and source of all government.
In the higher and truer sense politics ia
defined to mean "the science of government"
that part of ethics which has to do with thd
government of a nation or State, the preser
vation of Its safety, peace and prosperity the
defense of Its existence and rights ariin*t
fortlgn control or conquest, the augmentation
of its strength and resources and the protec

VOTK AT THE PRIMARIES.
Necessarily the agent is much fettered in
the freedom and independence of his action,
for he must I^J; to a fickle constituency for
the approval ot his conduct, and he Is at all
times conscious that there are 'sinister influ
ences always at work to minimize the value
of his services and scheming to compass h!s
defeat for re-election. He must labor in con
stant dread of bc-ing misunderstood and mis
judged and with little hope of being appre
ciated. *
Practically speaking, it may be said that all
the functions of government legislative ex
ecutive and judicial, are performed by agents
who derive their authority from the vote of
the indiscriminate* mass who constitute the
electors
ItlKhteous citizenship in the vote is of para
mount importance in this country, where not
only all power not delegated remains with
the people, but where all delegated power is
exercised either directly by agents chosen by
the people at the polls Â«r by agents appointed
by agents thus selected.
The subject for the ten minutes' address to
day i s "Kighteouii Citizenship in the Vote."
The four previous subdivisions of the main
subject 'or discussion have been so satisfac
torily presented that little remains to be said
of cfrfd duty. If the citizen comra up to the
Ideals already pointed out for him In the
office, in the shop. In the home and In public'
â¢spirit he may be safely trusted to show good
citizenship in hi* vote. Unfortunately, how
ever, he may be upright and blameless in any
one or all these four relations in life, jind yet
wholly neglect his duty at the polls and thus
omit one of his most important obligations to
society.
At noon to-day Right Rev. William
Ford Xichols, D. D., Biehop of Cali
fornia, will discuss the subject of
"Righteous Citizenship in the Church."
The services yesterday were led by T.
R. Kelley, and the lesson was taken
from St. Matthew, chapter 7, verses 15
to 20. Xorton P. Chipman, Supreme
Court Commissioner, spoke on "Right
eous Citizenship in the Vote." His re
marks were pertinent and he dealt in
a masterly manner with the various
phases of his subject. He said in part:
To-day marks the close of the noon
Lenten services in the rooms of the
Chamber of Commerce. The sugges
tion made that the daily devotional
services at noon be continued through
out the year has met with approval
and the Brotherhood of S^ Andrew is
considering the advisability of inaug
urating the custom.
Influence of Every Good
Citizen Needed in
Politics.
GENERAL N. P. CHIPMAN. WHO
SPOKE YESTERDAY AT THE
NOONDAY LENTEN SERVICES.
The distribution proceedings are the
result of a decision of the Supreme
Court which recently reversed Judge
Coffey's decision granting a new
trial of the contest . of the will
of Jose de Laveaga waged by An
eelmo de Laveaga, the natural son
of the decedent by a former â¢serv
ant in the De Laveaga family. Judge
Coffey decided thaf De Laveaga had
publicly recognized the contestant as
his son and he was therefore entitled
to one-quarter of the large estate. The
Supreme Court thought differently and
reversed Judge Coffey, thus rendering
possible the distribution of the estate
to the heirs-at-law. As an indication
that the natural son has accepted the
decree ol the Supreme Court as final
and has given up all hopes of obtain
ing any of the De Laveaga fortune
there was filed. yesterday a document,
signed by him, waiving his right to
appeal from the order distributing the
estate.
After being in the courts for years,
the De Laveaga estate is now in the
hands of the rightful owners, the two
sisters and brother of Jose de Laveaga,
the founder of the estate". A decree of
distribution was signed yesterday by
Judge Coffey. Maria J. de Cebrian and
Maria C. de Laveaga, sisters of the
deceased, and Miguel de Laveaga, his
brother, as a result of the order will
receive a fortune estimated to be worth
$800,000. Anselmo de Laveaga, the nat
ural son of the deceased, will receive
nothing.
A people not to be matched In energy, pa
tience, pluck and executive abilityâ this Is the
highest praise bestowed upon us by our Eng
lish critic. California started right; she was
peopled by the strong: the weak were not able
to get here In the exciting race which followed
the gold rush. There was a mixture of ele
ments in that immigration, but the -virile type
prevailed, and/ upon the whole, the "forty
niners",were well educated men. They desired
the advantages of education for their children,
and one of their first governmental acts was
to establish the public school system upon a
foundation of liberality which compared with
the very best examples to be found anywhere.
There has been continued progress in this di
rection and to-day more than half of the pub
lic revenues In California, State and local, are
expended upon education.
The committee announces that three
of the most prominent monthly maga-.
zines will devote extended space to the
State. Arrangements are being made
to. publish California numbers in lead
ing European papers. Through the
courtesy of President Wheeler of the
University of California articles upon
the. State's resources and products will
be translated into different languages.
Governor George C. Pardee pays a
striking tribute to California under
the caption, "California, the Empire
State of the West." He writes that
mightier progress awaits In the near
future. After dwelling.at length upon
the resources' of the State. Governor
Pardee closes his article as follows:
Yet, while all these 'things are true, while
California has been "endowed lavishly by the
Creator with all the forms of material wealth
and has been robed In beauty, it is people and
not resources that make -great States. The.iÂ«
are few countries blessed with natural riches
to an equal extent with England, and yet we
seldom think of that In connection with Eng
land's greatness. To few lands has nature
given more grudgingly than to New England,
but this has not prevented her people from be
coming rich through thrift and intelligence.
Germany, which is in large part a great, sandy
plain, is naturally far poorer than some of her
neighbors, but- her population Is rich In re
sources which exlct within Itself.
The New York World has issued a
California number at the suggestion
of the California . Promotion Commit
tee. It is said to be the best California
number ever .published by any paper
outside the State. Among the contrib
utors are Governor Pardee, James D.
Phelan, Bernard Moses, Charles Keeler,
Helen Gompertz Le Conte, Andrea
Sbarboro, Benjamin Ide Wheeler,
Lewis E.?Aubury, A. J. Wells, Edmund
O'Neil, Rufus P. Jennings, E. J. Wick
son and Benjamin C. Wright.

Natural Son of Deceased and
Claimant of His Wealth
Waives .Eight to Appeal
J. C. Stubbs. traffic director of the
Harriman linps, and his new assistant,
E. O. McCormiek, the present passen
ger traffic manager of the Southern
Pacific Company, arrived yesterday
from L<os Angeles. Mr. Stubbs' visit
to the coast at this particular time
ot the year had several purposes, the
main one being to visit his wife, who
during a spell of ill health has been
sojourning at Phoenix. From there he
went to L*?s Angeles to meet the or
ange growers, who had a grievance to
air. and then came north to meet the
local officials of the Southern Pacific
Company, a meeting that might be
construed as a social call, for it was
among these officials that Mr. Stubbs
found many years of pleasant associa
tion and from among whom he rose
:o his present responsible position in
Chicago.
In speaking of the recent promotion
ot Mr. McCormiek to the position of
assistant traffic director of. the Harri
man lines, the duties of which he is
soon to assume. Mr. Stubbs said yes
terday:
Mr. McCcrmick. oontrarr to the reports that
hÂ» :s to have charge of the parsenger business
cf the Harriman iln^s alone, will share with
Assistant Traffic Director Hen Campbell the
responsibilities of the freight business as well.
Their duties will be the Fame. The business in
both department* has prown in magnitude and
is in need cf the attention of two men.
DENIES HUMORED CHANGES.
The announcement that Mr. McCormlrk"s du
ties mek to be confined only to passenger mat
ters probably develojx-d out of the popular Idea
.Thst he is purely a passenger man. The fact
:s, however, ho began hip rallrcad career as a
Jrelght man and has alwayF been regarded as
a v*ry competent man in that line, notwith
standing the faVt that fcr a number of years
he has bc-ea giving his attention almost exclu
ti\f!y to jiassergrr traffic.
Reviewing the numerous reports that
Jiave been circulated relative to other
< hange? in the Harriman systems since
Mr. McCormick's promotion, Mr.
Ftubbs emphatically denied that any
wore contemplated and, continuing, he
said:
It iv penÂ«rally the rase when z.^ official of
*he Southern I'acifJo '"oinpany is advanced in
the railroad service, or retires, storir-s regard
ing ether changes are given circulation. So
!ar as I am aware, and 1 think 1 would know,
r.o changes other than those already officially
announced are to be made in the various traffic
<!epartments of the different Southern Pacific^
liney. Mr. Sproule will remain where he is. as
â¢reipht traffic manager of the Southern "Pacific
â¢'ompar.y. for no better reason than it is the
unanimous opinion of the higher officials of the
road that he is a valuable man ami could not
t-r very readily replaced. Mr. Goodman is not
going to be displaced in his position as gen
eral passenger agent of the company by Mr.
Â«:raig of Portland, and. if I have my say, Mr.
J-uce, uno needs no better commendation than
the results of his hard work in the position of
general freight agent, will remain where lie
if. He Is one o f the moÂ«t indefatigable work
ers in the railroad service and would be sor'ly
missed by Mr. Sproiiie.
FEE'S DLTIIIS CURTAILED.
It was also stated by Mr. Stubbs
that Charles Fee, who is coming here
to succeed E. O. McCormick as pas
senger traffic manager, will not have
as great a scope of duties nor will his
' title cover the same amount of terri
tory. Mr. Fee will be passenger traffic
manager of the Pacific system, which
includes everything except the lines
tast of El Paso. The latter lines em
braced In the Atlantic system, which
has heretofore been in charge of Mc-
Cormick, in so far as passenger traffic
is concerned, will be controlled by T.
J. Anderson, general passenger and
ticket agent of the company at Hous
ton.
McCORMICJTS IMG MAIL.
When Mr. MeCormick returned to
his office yesterday he found awaiting
nearly 600 letters and telegrams from
different parts of the United States,
conveying to him congratulations over
his promotion. In this huge stack of
correspondence were personal letters
from the newly appointed Secretary of
War Taft and Secretary of the Treas
ury J. M. Shaw and hundreds from
prominent men of the East with whom
Mr. McCormiek has long enjoyed ac
quaintance and not a few from men
in the humbler positions of life who
had in one way or the other at some
time in their careers felt the influence
of his friendly spirit.
Much speculation has been indulged
in in local raiirc-ad circles as to whether
Mr. McCormiek will take his secre
tary and stenographer, Gardner and
Hoover, with him to Chicago. The gen
eral supposition is that he will, for
they have been with him for many
years and are regarded as very com
petent men. but when the question was
put to him yesterday as to his plans
relative to the future of these gentle
men he stated that he had not yet
determined just what will be done. It'
is Mr. ftlcQonnSck'fl expectation to re
main here about a month.
Charles Fee is expected to arrive here
the first week in April. That the
Northern Pacific officials appreciate the
fact that they are losing a good traffic
man in Fee is suggested in the offer
made to him a few days ago of in
creased pay and the title of passenger
traffic manager of that road, but which,
it is said, he refused to accept.

Chemist Catford of Philadelphia Gives Strong

"I had a most oevere attack cf Kaatrltla.
which had caused me great suffering-. I was
recommended to try Munyon's Paw-Paw, and
i did so merely out of curiosity and not expect-
I ijig* to be benefited. Before I had taken half a
I bottle, however. I noticed a marked Improve-
ment, and lest than two bottles effected a com-
plete cure. I made an analysis of this remedy
and can truly say that I do not believe there js
another such strong combination of curative
properties so scientifically blended for the puri-

The California, Golden Gate and
East Oakland tennis clubs each has
a February tournament that has not
been completed on account of the con
tinued wet weather. The East Oak
land Club started the annual Alameda
County championships on Washing
ton's birthday and the doubles have
still to be decided. The final match
was started last Sunday, but had to
be postponed when the second set was
little more than started. MacGavin
and Variel won the first set and the
score in the second was 2-2. The Mur
dock - brothers have little chance of
beating the college men. The match
w'ill be completed to-morrow.
The finals of the. handicap doubles
tournament will be played to-morrow
TENNIS MATCHES
STILL UNPLAYED
Officials of Three Promi
nent Clubs Have Many
Tournaments to Complete
sold victory la anticipated. As usual
Stanford has only two or three player.s
ahd they are not first class. On the
other hand the University of Califor
nia has men like Drummond Mac-
Gavin, Robert Variel and Clautlr;
Wayne on whom to depend.
Harry Weihe, Stanford's best play
er, is still In college, but having played
four years is ineligible. Stanford has
a promising man in young Hodge, but
he is an Inexperienced player and can
not be depended upon. The only other
players are Cleve Ba*ser and Roy Lieb.
Both have played for the .college be
fore, but are hot clever enough to beat
the California representatives.
The annual tournament for the
championship of the University of
California, which has been In progress
for some time, is drawing to a close
and will be finished In a few days.
Three men are left. Claude Wayne,
the clever young player from Southern
California, has won a place in the fin
als. His easy victory over Variel in
the semi-flnals was quite a surprise.
Variel got but two games in as many
sets. Wayne will meet the winner of
the Williams-Neil Raker match. The
winner ef the tournament will pi. y
Drummond MacGavin, the present
champion, for the championship of
the year.
In addition to the foregoing gam^s
one more will be played before the en>l
of the present season. On Sunday,
April 24, a team made up of the best
players in the six other clubs of thÂ«
league will meet the Thistle eleven oi
the San Jose Athletic Grounds. Arthur
Robinson will be the referee. The com
bined team, as selected at the meeting
held on "Wednesday evening, consists
of Chivers of the Occidentals, goal
keeper; McKenzie of the Oakland Hot
ne^s, captain and right back; Pctersea
of the Vampires, left back; Duncanson
of the Independents, right half bacK;
ilathieson cf the Albion Rovers, center
half back; Turner of the Vampires, left
half back; Duquesne of the Albion
Rovers, outside right; T. Fay of tho
Independents, inside right; P. Fay of
the Independents, center forward; E.
Fay of the Independents, inside left:
Churchill of the Albion Rovers, outside
right. John of the Albion Rovers aivl
Milne of the Occidentals arc the re
serves. The defense of the combined
eleven is so strong that it is believti
the Thistles will be unable to pierce it.
At the meeting of the California
Association Football Union on Wednes
day evening Nolan of the Independents
v,*as suspended for the rest of the sea
son, for criticizing the officials.
Presidio Athletic Grounds will be thÂ»
scene of the most interesting and tha
most important game of the association
football season to-morrow, when thn
Thistles meet the Independents in the
final round for the California Union
cup. In the series of matches for the
championship of the California Asso
ciation Football League the Thistles
were only one point short of an abso
lutely clean score, making 23 points
out of a maximum of 24. No team beat
them during the season and only one
tied a match with them. The Inde
pendents have beaten every team ex
cept the Thistles. The ball will be
kicked off at 3 p. m. Arthur Robinson
will be thefeferee, with Xorman Logan
and C. \V. Irish as linesmen. If thÂ»Â»
weather is favorable it is expected a,
large etowd will turn out to watch the*
struggle. The teams will line up in
the following order:

ceded by the last game of the series
for the championship of the California
Association Football League. This will
be between the Oakland Hornets anJ
the Pickwicks, the two tail-endcrs in
the table of results for the season. As
both teams have four points apiece a
victory will save one of them from tha
position of last on the list. The con
test, being between opponents who are
well matched and eager for success,
should bo a close and interesting one.
The ball will be kicked oft at 1 o'clock.

On Saturday. April 2. there- will bÂ»
a friendly match on the ground at St.
Matthew's School, San Mateo, between
the Saturday Hornets and the Thistle.
The admirers of association football
know the same must be introduced at
the preparatory schools if it is to bo
taken up at the universities.
One week from to-morrow the bridge
at Tiburon will go up creakingly into
the air once more, and probably for
the last time, to let the yachts that
have been in winter quarters in the
lagoon come out into Belvedere 'Cove.
It is high water, 4.8, on that day at 2:22
p. m., so the tide will be running in
strongly, when the bridge is /raised at
noon. The yacht owners will have four
weeks In which to overhaul their craft
and fit them out for the coming sea
son.
The Corinthians will have their open
ing day on Saturday, April SO, and will
It is possible the track men will take
to the old racing track on the Palo
Alto Stock Farm as a substitute for
the varsity cinder path, which at pres
ent is in a deplorable condition. The
clock farm track is elevated so that
the water drains from it and it is in
fairly good condition. Captain Holman
thinks this plan a feasible way of ob
viating the present difficulties.
On Monday next a training, table .will
be established at the Stanford Inn for
the track men. The star men of the
squad will take their meals there reg
ularly until the day of the Intercolle
giate field day with Berkeley.
The most brilliant work on the field
has been that of Norman Dote. '04, in
the pole vault. His recent vault of 12
feet'?i Inch may be taken as a prog
nostication that he will be the world's
champion pole vaulter before the end
of the season.
The Stanford students are hoping
against all indications to the contrary
that next week may bring dry weather
in order that the varsity nine may
round into form for its first game with
California, which, will occur on the
Berkeley campus on Saturday, April
2, one week tfom to-morrow.
However, the varsity nine, notwith
standing adverse conditions, continues
to make a good showing in practice.
Coach Charles Doyle left the first of
the week to accept a position in the
Montreal team of t^ie Canadian league.
His duties have fallen largely upon
the shoulders of Treasurer Dave Cow
den of the Associated Students, who
for four years played a star game for
"*h<? Stanford varsity. James F. Lana
iran, '00. who so successfully coached
the football eleven last fall, will take
charge of the varsity nine whenever
he is able to leave his work at Bel
xnont and spend the afternoon at the
university. He knows the national
camo from start to finish and is an
excellent coach. While in college he
made his "S" as varsity pitcher.
With Their Preparations
ST.UCFOHD UNIVERSITY, March
25.â Never in the history of athletics
at Stanford has the work on track and
diamond been interfered with by the
inclemency of weather as it has been
this year. Only the back stretch of
the cinder path has been available for
w<rrk by the track men, while every
other day the diamond has been so
muddy that the ball tosscrs could not
etc-p on it without sinking ankle deep.
Inclement Weather Interferes Sadly
BERKELEY, March 25.â The most
Important step in years for the benefit
of athletics at the University ot Cali
fornia was taken this week, when the
executive committee of the Associated
Students paved the way for the estab
lishment of a training table for the
track men. This new idea for Cali
fornia is expected to do wonders for
the men now in training for the trials
against Stanford.
The. need of a training table was
never r.ea!ly felt at the university until
this year. In previous years California
lies nearly always been victor in the
Jitld events, but last year demonstrated
that success cannot always come. The
fethletes are so evenly matched on both
Fides that it is a problem which will
win this year. It only needs a little
shading to turn the result either way.
Trtiner Christie and Track Captain
' Cooley have realized for a long time
that a training: table is the thing.
By. placing the men at the training
"table the trainer may supervise their
eating, both as to quantity and qual
ity. The system will be particularly
beneficial to the long distance men, who
need to be dieted more than any others.
- The championship field day on Â¦Wed
nesday was the first real trial of the
season.. Several things happened to
â¢ rhuw that California is not so badly
(<*t in some departments as at first
thought. This has special reference to
the weijrht throwing of Sperry and the
v.ir.ning of the 440-yard run by Kern.
Bpcrry broke the college record. Kern's
easy victory in tho 440-yard run is an
indication that there is a chance for
California in trial against Stanford's
men, Dunn and Crossman. the winners
last year.
These two men, Sperry and Kern,
ere freshmen. Hume, winner of the
two hurdle races, and Abbott, who de
feated Captain Cooley in the high Jump,
are also freshmen. It seems the fresh
inen class contains all the best mate
rial just now. Hume Is already good
as a hurdler and in the course of time
wiD improve into a wonderful man.
'Abbott is an old-timer as a jumper,
even if he is a freshman, and will al
\yays be valuable to the college.
' SnedfÂ£2T wen the 220-yard d?yh and
the broad jump and seems to be clos
ing his college career in a blaze of
slory. Great things are expected of
him at the intercollegiate trials.

Corbett and "Philadelphia" Jack
O'Brien came within an 'ace of swap
ping punches in the corridor of the
Iro<raois Kotei here to-night after a
red-hot argument. Ha4 it not been
for the fact that friends crowded
about the pugilists and advised them
to cocfine themselves to a business
chat about ring encounters, there is
little doubt that "Gentleman Jim"* and
the Quakertown middle-weight would
have clashed. O'Brien _wanted to se
cure a match with Corbett, bat the
latter wouldn't listen to him. Corbett
told O'Brien he must "whip Tommy
Rvan before he asks for a match.

The Scotch bowlers are anxiously
awaiting the opening of the new- green,
which has been unused for several
JTh-cnths. If the weather permits tour
nament play will be started next Satur
day. Some of the members have prac
ticed on'the recreatioa field rinks at the
park, but bowling has been out of the
question for the last three or four
weeks ca account cf the rain.
The new green Is not so far cut as
the eld one. and is also much better in
every other way. The drawings have
been held fcr a singles and a doubles
tourney, and both win be started April
2. There win probably be a number of
surprises in the opening' retards, as the
contestants have had little or no oppor
tunity to practice of late. Many of the
players win bowl to-day If the weather
permits.

strengthening the tone of jobbing and

whole, however, is not up to a year

the unquestionably better winter wheat

throughout the Southwest and eviden
ces of further activity and strength ia
the iron and steel- trades. Weather :
conditions also have allowed of in-(
creased outdoor activity, notably In
building, but signs- of increased ten
sion in labor matters constitute a
drawback at several large centers.
Railway earnings tend to improve aa
the transportation difficulties are sttr
maunted and the outlook Is that gross
receipts for March win show a slight
increase over a year ago. Spring goods
in nearly all lines are in better request
at leading centers.
The situation in the metal markets
generally is a very satisfactory one.
Copper, notably, saw an increased for

R. G.-Dun &. Co.'s weekly review of
trade to-morrow will say:
Little net chanse ia conditions Is
noted for the past week. Storms and
ftaods did much damage to property
and threatened general prospects at
the start, but subsequently the weather
improved and the outlook brightened.
Spring trade Is expanding, although
stfll backward to some extent and new
labor conditions have added to the
number of unemployed despite an ami
cable arrangement cf the sheet and
.tin plate scale. BuHding operations
would be very vigorous if empldyers
' and wage earners could adjust differ
ences. Inquiries for structural material
are out. of proportion to new. permits,
which Is probably dae to the fact that
tliere is much resumption of postponed
work. i
Railway earnings ia three weeks cf
March are only 1-4 percent better than
a year ago and far in excess of any j
preceding, year. Drifting advances irÂ»
several departments of the iron -and
steel industry indicate that there is less
pressure to sell and more readiness on

ENJOYABLE CONCERT BY
BIOZART SYMPHONY CLUB
The announcement that Captain J.
"W. Saunders, at present on the steam
ship Newport, has been chosen to com
mand the Pacific Mail Company's new
liner Manchuria has aroused fresh In
terest in the two big vessels which,
within a short time, will take their
places on the run between here and
the ports of the Orient. The Mongolia,
in command of Captain RInder, is well
on her way to San Francisco. The
Manchuria will be ready to follow in
a few weeks.
The new vessels have received the
approval of naval experts, who, after
a recent thorough inspection, pro
nounced them the ' best appointed
steamships afloat.
With seven decks and a displace
ment of 26,530 tons, these two big sis
ters will be a great addition to the
port's equipment "for handling. the rap
idly growing trade with the Orient.
The Manchuria will be able to carry
14,000 tons dead weight of cargo; 450
first-class passengers, 1300 steerage
passengers and a crew of about 250 all
told. She will have an average speed
of sixteen knots.
Both vessels are equipped with the
latest devices for handling freight and
the system of signals from bridge to
every other part of the vessel Is said
to be wonderfully complete. In addi
tion to every convenience for the com
fort of passengers, each of the big
liners Â¦will be provided with a well
equipped hospital.
The Pacific Mail Company will have
its new liners here long before the
new wharves so badly needed are
built, fir before their construction has
even been begun. To such a magnitude
has trade with the Orient grown that
the local facilities for handling it are
altogether inadequate. The Pacific
Mail wharf is the largest in this port,
but when one of the big liners, Siberia
or Korea, has discharged her cargo,
every available inch of space is 'taken
up with merchandise piled, for the
most part, roof high. So great Is the
congestion that moving the freight is a
most tedious operation, involving an
expensive waste of the time and en
ergy of truck horses and teamsters. In
addition to this, the piled up bales and
boxes would form an Impregnable bar
ricade against the. Fire Department , in
the event of a conflagration and thou
sands of tons of costly merchandise
would be at the mercy of the flames.
Plans for three new double-deck
wharves have been prepared and Just
as soon as possible the Harbor Com
â¢mlsslon has promised to begin their
construction. Meanwhile the Mongolia
and Manchuria, greater carriers - than
even the Siberia and Korea, will short
ly add to the problem of handling' two
tons of freight where there is room to
handle one.

Speaks on "Die Meistersinger."
A small but appreciative audience
greeted Mrs. Raymond Brown last
night at Lyric Hall. Mrs. Brown gave
the third of a series of musical talks
on the music dramas of Richard Wag
ner. .Mrs. Brown spoke on "Die Meis
terslnger von Nurnberg," illustrating
her remarks by passages from the
opera rendered on the piano. "Die
Meistersinger," the one comedy that
Wagner wrote, is faithful to the classic
ideal. It deal with the petty foibles,
the manner, follies and vices of the
common people of a small German
city 300 years ago and holds them up
to ridicule with delightful satire. Mrs.
Brown will speak this afternoon on
"Parsifal."

When Deputy Sheriff Galland had the
Judgment placed In his hands some
ten days ago he put off the execution
of the court's order In the hope that
the old shoe merchant might be able
to find some one of his old-time friends
that might be willing to assist him
In his dire distress. But no one came
to the rescue, and yesterday morning
Galland was compelled to perform his
duty.
While Mrs. MacNamara was out sell-
Ing pencils the furniture, cobwebbed
and dingy, was taken from the base
ment. McXamara was at a loss to
know what to do. He said that Mrs.
Katherine Peltier, wife of John Pel
tier of the firm of Peltier & Co., as
phaltum roofers and workers of 11S6
Mission street, was his daughter, but
they, he said, had been estranged for
years.
Mrs. Peltier was seen at her hus
band's place of business by a repre
sentative of The Call, and when told
of her parents' plight saitf that she
had not spoken to her father or mother
for ten years, and also said that she
could not help them.
In the meantime the aged man* was
walking Natoma street in a quandary
as to what was best to be done when
Adjutant J. II. Bahberry of the Salva
tion Army came upon the scene, hav
ing been sent by Brigadier George
Wood, who had heard at the army's
headquarters of MacNamara's plight.
Adjutant Banberry lost no time, and
under the circumstances did the best
he could and procured three rooms for
the old couple at 363 Natoma street.
After paying a month's rent the Sal
vation Army man had the MacNamara
belongings removed from the sidewalk
to the humble apartments.
Years ago MacNamara had a boot
and shoe store on Fifth street, under
the Winjdsor Hotel. He later moved
to 921 Mission street, where he did a
thriving business.
The ground on Seventh street on
which at one time the Milwaukee
Brewery stood wa3 owned by MacXa
mara, and was sold six years ago for
52250, though the property, with Im
provements, cost him $10,000. He also
owned property on University avenue,
Berkeley, but it was sold at a sacrifice.
The rent owed by â¢ MacNamara
amounts to $88, and the landlord, A.
Oettl, has shown patience in waiting
months for a settlement.
Testerday the old man's goods and
chattels, woeful to look upon, were
put out on the sidewalk from the dinjry
basement in which MacNamara and his
wife lived for some time at 446 Natoma
street.
Ill-luck of all descriptions has
brought the one time well-to-do boot
and shoe merchant, Andrew MacXa
mara, to the door of poverty.

WHEAT â Liverpool futures were hisher and
Pails futures lower. Chicago ,, continued to
.fluctuate on crop conditions. The Modern
Miller Is {riving a better report of the crop out
look, while the report of Snow, the .statistician,
takes exactly the opposite ground. It says that
with the parsing of the frost It is evident that
the promise of winter Wheat Is poor.- S"H,iinK
was late, the fall growth small and the winter
severe. The enow, protection was insufficient,
except in the lake district, and there was more
winter killing than for some years. South of
the Ohio River. the outlook is poor 'and much
seeded lard will be plowed up. The dry
weather In the Southwest also did more or less
damage. . . . -. â¢
The Chicago letter of. Mitchell. Muleahy *;
Co. said: "It was a nervous market, with
trade principally local by reason of the lack
of telegraphic communication, the wires out of
Chit-ago being pretty generally down. Cables
show-'d fair strength and the May price In other
markets and premiums for cash wheat were
maintained. The principal bullish feature of the
day was Snow's crop report, which Intimates
that conditions are away b*low the average,
and says that more than the usual amount of
winter killing is apparent. On the other hand,
the Modern Miller. If bullish at all. was only
mildly so The crop and the cfmh situation are
the Important . factors. The latter may be to
same extent artificial, but. whatever thÂ» cause,
the fact remains that spot Wheat Is relatively
high and not easy to buy. The crop situation
i* likely to keep the market- guessing: for. some
time to comet - On these .conditions, while we
lock "for a' good scalping market, think we
would rather buy wheat on the breaks."
This market was quiet .and unchanged.

The receipts of Butter. Cheese and Eggs for
the past twenty- four hours were very heavy,
as will be seen below. Those of Eggs were
the largest for the current season. The But
ter market showed no pronounced decline, but
the feeling was perceptibly weaker, and the
general expectation was that quotations were
on . the verge of a recession. As for Cheese,
the feeling was as" weak as ever. Eggs, too,
were decidedly easy, and the retailers report
ed that they could buy lower than on the
preceding day. while buyers out in the coun
try reduced their bids to producers. Lower
grade Eggs lost the gain of the day before,
but quotations for best ranch were maintained,
though not as easily as on the preceding day.

Kan Ike's circular says: "The quantity of
colonial coal In first hands has shrunk consid
erably, hence all to arrive prior to the 1st of.
June will find ready sal? at full prices. On
the chartered list from Newcastle there are
sixteen vessels named, with a carrying capacity
of over 4&.00O tons. Our prolonged rainstorms
have largely increased sales of all grades of
coal which are suited for household purposes;
all the British Columbia coals which ere avail
able for domestic uaes have found ready buyers
at profitable figures, hence there la but very
little coal now In yard. There is a quantity
of Australian Richmond coal, which is being
readily disposed of, it finding a demand for
staves and grates: still, if Australia wants to
sustain itself In this market for the disposition
of Its coal products, it will be forced to reduce
its delivery price at Newcastle cr the cost of
carriage from the rclnea here must be materially
modified. Oil fuel still holds its grasp among
consumers hers fcr steam uses, the output
shows no algns of decrease, as new Salds are
being developed with very promising prospects.
Our increase of population Is showing itself
very markedly through the consumption of
household coals, with every promise that it will
continue lor some time to come."

Burbanks was quiet, as buyers were holding off
awaiting the unloading of the Oregon steamer,
which arrived about noon with 0009 sacks.

were neglected. Nevadans were meeting with
a fair inquiry at $2 50<tr2 Co per cental. A
few small shipments of Sweets came In and
were held at a sharp advance.
The market for Asparagus opened firm under
limited supplies and a good dsmand and prices
o" all grades advanced: Receipts were 510
boxes, nearly all of which came In late in the
forenoon after most buyers had left th? market.
The belated arrivals, however, met with a
steady demand and the prioes established dur
ing the early trada were well maintained.
Rhubarb waa In free supply nnd unchanged,
while Peas did better under limited receipts,
with some dealers trying to obtain 7c pÂ«r pound
for the best lots of bay. Tomatoes were
scarce and recaCked offerinKS from the south
readily commanded higher prlcrs. Some poor
lots of old stock were offerlny below the quo

attly th<s nm* as quoted laat week, whtla
California Cheese is cheaper.
Fish and Meats are still selling, at thÂ«
familiar quotat!ona and Poultry has changed

A petition to modify a decree of di
vorce, the means taken bv Bessie E.
Paxton, the singer, the former wife
of Blitz w. Paxton, the Sonoma
County banker and capitalist, to se
cure more alimony, is not the proper
proceeding, hence Judge Murasky
found against her yesterday, and or
dered the entry of an order denying
her petition. She must file a suit in
equity to set aside the agreement she
made at the time she secured her di
vorce, in which she waived all claims
against Paxton for the sum of $13,200.
to be paid in monthly installments of
5100, which agreement, she claims, was
obtained from her by misrepresenta
tion.
The matrimonial history of the Pax
tons is a stormy one. They were mar
ried In 1882, and have two children,
a boy and a girl. The boy, who Is
now almost 19 years of age, is blind.
The troubles of the Paxtons com
menced a short time after their mar
riage.. In 1894 she sued him for di
vorce and obtained a. decree on the
ground of cruelty. She agreed that
she would waive all claims upon Pax
ton provided that for a period of 132
months he would. pay her $100 a month.'
When the children grew up and the
boy lost his sight and the girl became
sickly, Mrs. Paxton found.it hard to
make both ends meet on $100 a month,
and she went upon the stage. For a
period of two weeks she sang at the
Orpheum. Then Paxton fell heir to a
fortune estimated to be worth $500,000,
and Mrs. Paxton thought It about time
that he should do a little more' for
her than give her $100 a month. She
accordingly filed the suit to arnend
her decree of divorce, basing her claim
on the ground that Paxton, -to obtain
her signature to the agreement cono
cerning alimony, had willfully and
fraudulently concealed the true state
of -his finances. *

Money lenders who advance cash to
clerks of the Southern Pacific Com
pany and take as security an
assignment of wages . base their
hopes for reimbursement on a
very flimsy article, according to a
decision rendered by Judge Hebbard
yesterday in the case of W. C. Knox
against the Southern Pacific Company.
He decided that Knox could not col
lect from the defendant the money ad
vanced by T. H. Weyburn to H. B.
Cady, a railroad clerk, on the strength
of an assignment by Cady of his sal
ary for the months of November and
December, 1902.
Judge Hebbard's decision reverses
that of Justice of the Peace Daniels,
who gave Knox Judgment against the
railroad company. The amount in
volved is $150. Knox claimed that he
was entitled to redress on the strength
of a notice he had sent to the South
ern Pacific Company informing the
corporation, that he held Cady.'s as
signment.

his defense to-day.
Tito Bernardi showed to the satis
faction of Mogan's court that he was
merely defending himself from assault
by Frank Rossetti, who was armed with
a pistol, when "the twain were arrested
in the Pacific street saloon in which
they were employed as . bartenders.
Bernardi's' weapon was a light piece of
wood, but the charge against him was
assault with _ a deadly weanon. â¢Â¦
In dismissing the case against Ber
nard! the Judge remarked that he
would like to have arresting officers
devote more care to the charging of
prisoners, as evident ambithm to make
cases more serious than they really are
often leads to dismissal of the com
plaint, whereas conviction of a minor
"By which time," he subsequently re
marked, "I hope that an all-around
agreement out of court shall have been
effected. The longer the original case
remains in court the more numerous do
the side issues seem to become, and If
an amicable settlement cannot be ar
ranged by the parties themselves, I'm
afraid that entire block of Prospect
avenue will be Involved."
Judge Mogan is still wrestling with
the complex legal problems developed
by the litigious propensity of the Ka
filshes, who dwell op Prospect avenue.
In the same block reside the McEach
ans and the Newmans, and for more
than a twelvemonth last past the three
families have been at bitter and re
lentless war.
The story of the tumult first entered
the courts when Duncan, chief of the
McEachans, was accused of assault by
Miss Pearl Kaflish. The man was held
to the Superior Court, where a Jury ac
quitted him. Next he appeared aa de
fendant before Judge Mogan on a
charge of addressing offensive lan
guage to Miss Kaflish, and that accu
sation Is now under advisement. Then
came the young woman's mother with
a charge .of disturbing the peace
against Katie Newman, her next-door
neighbor, and that case, too. Is under
Judicial consideration. The two cases
were due for final settlement yesterday,
but when his Honor surveyed the ar
ray of lawyers and witnesses he or
dered a continuance till April 21.

ord.
A battle royal was in progress at 2.1

his rather rough method of making his
presence known. In dismissing the
case the Judge advised the defendant
to curb his impetuosity when he over
takes ladles of his acquaintance on the
street.
Another case that conveyed recrea
tion to the bench-warmers was the
complaint of Marie Alberts against
Lola Hallett and Lillie King. Miss Al
berts charges unprovoked assault and
battery upon her by the defendants on
the night of March 1 in a subterra
nean vaudeville theater at Kearny and
Jackson streets, wherein all the par
ties were employed to attract and en
tertain a capricious public. Testimony
for the prosecution was concluded a
Since the opening of the Botkin trial
the police courts have been crowded
daily, the audiences being largely made

into the minor temples of Justice. This
human overflow may not be regaled as
much as It would be by the testimony
and tilts of counsel in the famous pois
oning case, but it seldom fails to get
entertainment that is worth much more
than the price of admission.
The people that yesterday filled every
inch of the space allotted to specta
tors In Judge Mogan's court were both
instructed and amused while Violet
Carter and James Stevens were under
examination on a charge of having
stolen money from a Portuguese mari
ner one night about a month ago in
a Washington-street saloon. The fe
male defendant's story was especially
interesting to the masculine portion of
the assemblage, Inasmuch as It exposed
some of the Inner secrets of her pro
fession of dance hall waitress. She
stated that on the night of the alleged
robbery she induced the complainant
to purchase and h'elped him consume
no less than twenty-eight quart bottles
of beer, for which he paid 60 cents a
bottle, 50 per cent of the total sum
being paid her as commission on the
Sales. When she requested her escort
to buy the twenty-ninth bottle he
balked, and then, concluding that there
was no more money to be made out of
him, she .decided to "shake him," and
was attempting to do so when he struck
her.
"Then what did you do?" inquired
the Judge.
"I smashed his nose," murmured Vio
let, "and then the policeman came and
I was arrested for robbing him."
Stevens, who -was bartender in the
saloon where the confessed assault and
alleged theft occurred, succeeded in
convincing the court pretty thoroughly
that he was. not an accomplice of Vio
let In the "shaking down," as he termed
it, and the court intimated its inten
tlon>of dismissing the case against him
to-day. The woman, however, is like
ly to be held to the Superior "Court.
Jurge Cabaniss dismissed the charge
of attempted larceny against Henry
Tallman, who pleaded that he did not
intend to rob Miss Annie Sheridan
when he ran up and grasped her shoul
ders as she was walking along Tenth
street. The young lady's purse was
detached from Its fastening and drop
ped to the ground, and she had Tall
man arrested for attempting to steal

time John Peterson, a friend of Lar
sen, embraced Ferguson with the in
tent of aiding the fugitive to escape,
and he was arrested and will be sen

him twenty-four hours' imprisonment.

Conflicting with the foregoing testi
mony are the statements of the com
plaining witness and her "lady friend,"
Miss Leontine Center, also a vaudeville
artist. These two ladles declare un
equivocally that both the defendants

tenance until her eyes were blackened

A. Hallett, who described himself as
assistant manager, saw Miss King and
Miss Alberts (stage name, Gtsmonda)
with their fingers entangled In each
other's coiffure, and after some diffi
culty, he separated them. To the best
of his knowledge and belief no blows
were' struck. Julius Mentle, who
.proudly proclaimed himself a come
dian, witnessed the altercation between
Lillie and Gismonda, and had an in-'
distinct recollection of hearing Miss
Hallett advise Miss King to "give it to
her," but he saw no blows struck.
Chris Nelson, another comedian, was
in his dressing room when he heard the
row, and when he rushed out and saw
that it was "only a hair-pulling" he re
turned to seclusion. Miss King ad
mitted that she pulled Glsmonda's hair,
but positively denied having struck her.
As she haulfed Glsmonda's flaxen
tresses that lady shouted, "Willie, help
me," and Miss Hallett remarked that
it was then too late for "Willie" to
help her. Miss Hallett swore that at
no time during the dispute was she
within five feet of Gismonda, and cer
