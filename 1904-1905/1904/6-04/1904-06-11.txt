The work abounds in such old names
as the L#es. Carrolls, Adamses, Frank
lins, Jays and Livingstons, while that
of Colonel Washington is especially
prominent. All kinds of evidence has
been submitted to the genealogical so
ciety by applicants for distinction.
Some send photographs of inscriptions
and armorial designs engraved on
tombstones centuries old. county court
records and old official documents,
pieces of old silver plate with names
and armorial designs engraved thereon
and panefc of old carriage doors. Let
it be remembered, however, that there
is still extant and in full force in Eng
land a statute prescribing both fine
and Imprisonment for the use of a coat
of arms by those not entitled, and as
many of the old English laws are still
operative in the States of the Union, it
would be wise for ambitious appli
cants not to attempt to ring in any
spurious relics.
The California list Is conspicuously
lacking in such prominent names as
Stanford. Huntington. Crocker. Mills.
Fair. Oelrlchs and Mackay. This does
not mean necessarily that these proud
family names are :.ot entitled to reg
istry. They may have neglected to
establish their rights. Thus, for in
stance, the ultra democratic Colonel
John P. Irish might have no difficulty
CALIFORNHNS ON THE LIST.
For the most part the names found in
the American Peerage Book are of
those descended from the proud
Knickerbocker families of New Tork.
Puritans of New England, Quakers of
Pennsylvania. Huguenot exiles of noble
blood and cavaliers of the South. Fore
most among the Knickerbocker fami
lies stands the name of Roosevelt, in
cluding Theodore, descendant of Claes
Martensen Van Roosevelt, who came
from Holland and settled in New Tork
in 1651. The coat of arms of the Roose
velt family is thus stated in technical
heraldic terms: "Argent, on a mount
vert, a rosebush with, three roses, P.
P. R." Translated into plain English
this means a coat of arms, the design
a green hill on a silver background, a
rosebush showing three roses, etc.
Family names have been Inserted
only when actual history has clearly
shown the family to be entitled to tha
distinction and in no case has any
compensation, direct or indirect, been
accepted for the publication. In other
words, one's right to a coat of arms
must be genuine â blown in the bottle.
Mere wealth counts for nothing, for
such families as the Vanderbllts, the
Astors, the Whitneys. tne Stuyvesant
Fishes and the Belnonts are consplc
ously absent from the American list.
The Astors and Vanderbilts could trace
their- orisin back to the days of "Little
Old New York" or New Amsterdam,
when their forefathers were engaged
in the honorable occupation of trading
coonskins in the Northwest Territory,
but here the trail stopped and they
could not show they were descended
from a line of Kings like J.Pierpont
Morgan, who boasts of descent from
Gwyrmed Cymrie. who was King of
all Wales.
NEW YORK, June 10.â A representa
tive of The Call has been permitted to
examine the advance sheets of the
forthcoming "Peerage Book," about
which the social set of New Tork has
been agog for several weeks. The lines
drawn by the Genealogical Association
of New Tork, under whose direction
the volume has been prepared by Wil
liam Armstrong Crosier, will prove a
shock to the Four Hundred, for many
of them will look In vain through Its
pages for their names. This registry
of American families entitled to a coat
of arms is the first of its kind to ba
published in the United States. Brit
ishers'have for a long time turned up
their aristocratic noses at America. A
fine country but "too new" they have
declared. We have lacked ancient tra
ditions, hoary rains, and. worst of all.
a "peerage book" that has enabled
Britishers and the cations of Conti
nental Europe to trace their ancestry
for centuries and prove that purple
blood runs in their veins. We have had
out "social registers" published by en
terprising who charged
fees for designing coats of arm-;, crests
and mottoes for the worthy and ambi
tious people, but a genuine peerage
book, such" as Burke's Peerage, pub
lished in England, has for many years
been a long: felt want In families of
America who have great social preten
sions.

Subsequently. In a careful investiga
tion by a Call representative, many
details of the affair were found out.
There were three attempts made to
burn the mill. - v The first one was be
tween 2:20 and 3 o'clock on Saturday
afternoon. May 21. As is the custom,
the men In the mill quit work at 2:30
â¢ â¢n Saturdays. At 4:43 o'clock they
axe locked wp. There arc over 600
convicts employed In the' mil!. On
the day In question all hands had left
the mill. Including the gunrds.
Two cf the guards returned and went
to the back of the mi!L In the pre
paratory department, where the raw-
Jute in first put into the machine?,
they E.nv a blaze, and on investigation
thÂ« y found that a quantity cf fiber had
Leen neatly piied in one corner. In the
middle nf this pile there was a light
ed candle. It had burned down to the
â¢â¢kindling," and the pile of fiber was
igniting rapidly.
STRAITJACKFT APPLIED.
â¢ Those who know all the facts will not
talk. In regard to the fire they simply
fay that at various times little blazes
are discovered in the mill, but they are
of no consequence. Tet with all the
assertions to the contrary from semi
official circles the fact leaked out a few
days ago that such an, attempt had
been made. \ '
1 OFFICIALS ARE RETICENT.
This much of the plot Is known. It
has been obtained from some of the
convicts suspected cf complicity in the
plot, yet the full details cannot be
ascertained. The officials themselves
are unable to ferret them out. The
convicts are extremely secretive upon
the subject when questioned by the of-
JVers of the prison. The matter has
been kept very' quirt by the attaches
of the prison. In fact, very few of the
guards know of the attempted escape
at all. The higher officials are particu
larly non-committal. Some deny that
an attempt at a Jail break was thought
cf. Others say they heard something
about it. but know none of the facts.
The tlan evidently was to Eet the
mill on fire, then while the prison of
ficials were excited and the guards
busily at work attempting to stay the
progress cf the flames the convicts were
to make a break for liberty. The cap
tain's off.ee was to be the objective
point of attack. While more apparatus
was being brought inside the walls the
pates would have to be opened. At
that time it was the plan of the con
victs to overpower the guards and, to
gether with Captain Harrison, Turnkey
Swan and a number of guards as a
shield, from the rifle fire, force their
way to liberty.
It was a most desperate chance to
take and probably many prisoners
would have been killed, yet the ring
leaders of the plot had so minutely out
lined their mode of procedure that ul
timate success to them seemed worth
the chance.
PLAN OF THE CONVICTS.
That the formation of the plot was
v.ell generated is evident from the fact
that not until every convict was out
of the Jute mill was the fire discovered.
It was set in the rear in what is known
as the preparatory department. Two
guards who had left the mill suddenly
returned and were the ones to discover
the f.re. In ten minutes more the en
tire building would have been in flames.
The fire apparatus Is utterly inade
quate to fight a conflagration, and the
entire structure, with its 5400/000 worth
of machinery and thousands of dollars'
worth cf grain bags and raw Jute,
would have been consumed in a short
time. Afthe time the nte was discov
ered all of the 800 convicts employed
in the manufacture of grain bags were
cut cf the mill. There were about 600
In the upper prison yard, while the
balance were in the lower yard.

Foreign Residents Ask Permission to
Depart on Norwegian Steamer.
CHEFU, June 11, noon. â Letters
received here from foreigners in busi
ness at Port Arthur state that appli
cation has been made to the Russian
authorities to allow the Norwegian
steamer Sentis to - take foreign non
combatants away from Port Arthur.
It is thought that the Russian authori
ties will grant the request. The fact
that the application has been made
would indicate that the entrance to the
.harbor of Port Arthur Is at least par
tially clear, as the Sentis is a large
ship. She has been at Port Arthur ever j
since the commencement of hostilities. ]
The letters from the foreign business j
men make no reference to fighting or
other conditions at Port Arthur beyond
the statement that the price of rice has

The Korean Ministry of War has
recommended the distribution of 2500
Korean soldiers in garrisons of from
fifty to 300 along the Tumen River, the
great south road and in several im
portant towns in the interior of Ham
heung province in order to prevent fu
ture Russian raids. This recommenda
tion has not yet been sanctioned, and
the policy is considered to be question
able. It is said to be probable that the
majority of such a force would desert
with their rifles and become bandits,
and would engage in robbing the coun
try people rather than in opposing the
Russian raiders, thus embarrassing the
officials.

BOLD PLOTGF CONVICTS FRUSTRATED
ST. PETERSBURG, June 10.â News
of the fighting at Sluyen furnishes food
for much speculation concerning the
real Japanese objective. Whether the
advance to Siuyen constitutes a for
ward movement in force, â¢ military
authorities do not pretend to know. Its
character depends largely on whether
General Kurokl has the number of
troops which reports credit him. It Is
thought that the Japanese may at
tempt to push across the peninsula and
establish a new base at Newchwang.
The direct road to Newchwang
passes south of Haicheng. Such a
movement on the part of General Ku
rokl might precipitate a serous en
gagement in the neighborhood of Hai
cheng if General Kuropatkin thought
the time ripe to contest the advance
seriously. But it is also pointed, out
that the Japanese movements to Sal
matsze and Sluyen may be either feints
or .merely a continuation of an effort
to distract' the Russian attention from
Port Arthur. . * *' ~

ST. PETERSBURG, June 10, 4:14 p.
m. â There is reason to believe that the
plans for the departure of the Port Ar
thur- squadron in the event that the
fall of the fortress becomes imminent
have been completed. They involve the
co-operation of the. Vladivostok squad
ron. After the blockading fleet has been
engaged the uninjured Russian shipd
will effect a junction with the Vladivo
stok squadron and make their way to
Vladivostok. The fact that the Korean
Straits are. mined and guarded by a
Japanese torpedo boat flotilla, which
has been established to the satisfaction
of the admiralty here, greatly increas*-*
the difficulty of the operation, but' the'
Russians probably . wilf prefer to take
chances of getting through rather than
of making a two thousand mile jour
ney around Japan. The attempt may
occur at the first favorable opportunity.
The squadron is useless for the defense
of Port Arthur, while if preserved en
tire or in major portion even the fall
of Port Arthur would be robbed of
much of its importance from the
standpoint of Russia's future plans.
The repairs to the Russian battle
ship Pobieda are now practically com
pleted.

VICTOR, Colo., June 10.â The inquest
In the cases of the men who were killed
by the explosion in the railroad depot
near Florence was concluded to-day
and the following verdict rendered:
"An Inquisition held at Cripple
Creek, in Teller County, State of Col
orado, on the Sth and 10th days of
June, A. D.. 1904, before George R. A.
Hall, Coroner of said city, upon the
bodies of Gus Augustine. Arthur Muh
leise, Henry Haag, Herbert McCoy,
William Franklin, Edward Ross, and
others, there lying In death, by its
Jurors whose names are hereunto sub
scribed, said Jurors, upon their oaths,
do say that said persons came to their
death by an explosion of dynamite, or
ether explosives, at the Florence and
Cripple Creek depot at or near the
town of Independence, Teller County,
Colorado, on the morning of June 6.
1904, about 2:30 o'clock.
"We further find that said explosive
was exploded by an Infernal machine
parposely and artfully set and dis
charged by some person to the Jury
unknown for the purpose of willfully,
maliciously and feloniously killing and
murdering said persons and others;
that said crime is one of similar crimes
designed and committed in the Cripple
Creek* district during the past few
months, and perpetrated for tbÂ« pur
pose of killing and intimidating non
union miners and thereby preventing
them from working, and that 6ald
crimps are the result of a conspiracy
enteifd Into by certain members of the
Western Federation of Miners, and
known, Incited and furthered by cer
tain officials of that organization."
'It Is said that so much testimony of
an Incriminating character was given
by some of the prisoners that many
who v/ere to be deported were sent to
the County Jail, where they will remain
until arraigned in court.
Shortly after 6 o'clock to-night the
committee adjourned, having examined
all the prisoners and disposed of all
the business before It. Only two men
were' released from custody, to-day by
the committee.

Ing there,", said Burns. ."They are,
most of them, men with families, and
they are neither law-breakers nor agi
tators. I would not refuse a man work
because he idid not belong to the union
nor because^he did. I wanted the best
miners, and kept weeding out the poor
ones? without reference to unions. I arn
a firm believer In what they call 'the
open shop.' If other mine owners had
adopted my plan there would not be
an idle mine in the camp to-day and
there would not be a disturbance
worthy of the name.
DENVER, June 10. â The following

"I have not been asked for my

"but I have heard that members of the
mob which has taken control of the
affairs of the county are after me, as
well as the other county officials. I
shall stay In Denver until after the
militia has been withdrawn from the
district. I have no idea of resigning,
but It is Impossible to do business
properly and orderly In Cripple Creek
under present conditions. Judge Seeds
has ' telephoned me not to return to
Cripple Creek until the military rule
has been abolished.
"The conditions in the district at
present are such that I do not feel it
best to attempt to hold any court there.
I shall hold court here for a week for
Judge Llndsey. who has gone East. . It
Is known among all of the officials who
have left Teller County that those of

chased tickets over the' Rock Island
Railroadâ Poole for McCune, Kans..
and Parker for Kansas Cityâ and
boarded a train at Colorado Springs
several hours after the explosion. This
is coupled by the authorities with the
fact that bloodhounds .followed the

miles out and lost it at a point where
he was taken into a wagon that had.
been waiting there, and then driven
toward Colorado Springs. The report
Employers In all branches of business

The present, scale of wages will prevail

It Is conceded, if they are conducted on

The Women's Auxiliary of the Min

military authorities to hold meetings.
Joseph Hamilton, chairman of the
Democratic County Central Commit
tee, was called before the Citizens' De
portation Committee to-day and asked
concernins his sympathy with union
ism. Hamilton acknowledged that he
believed In unions and he was' told
that ht must leave camp within the
next four days. He was allftwed this
respite because of his standing in the
community and because he is a mem
ber of the Masonic fraternity. Hamil
ton was one of the delegates from '.his
county to the recent State convention
at Pueblo. /
Another party of exiled men .will be
eent out of the district to-morrow. Six
ty men confined In the Cripple Creek

to-day and charges of murder were
placed against them.
Work was resumed this morning at
come mines employing non-union men
which had been closed since Monday,'
the Stratton Independence, owned by
an English company, being the first to
reopen. The Portland mine is closed
by order of General Sherman M. Bell,
military commander, and Its 400 em
ployes will be compelled, General Bell
has said, to abandon the union or leave
the district.
The train stopped long enough at this
place to give the soldiers time to eat
The deported men had rations of beans
and bread on board.
Mayor Harris of this city had been
apprised of the decision to deport the
men, and Immediately took steps to
pee that none of them landed Jn Colo
rado Springs. Under his instructions
a large force of officers and deputies
met the special train at 6:10 o'clock
this evening for that purpose. No at
tempt was made, however, to unload
the men here, arrangements having
previously been made to send them to
the Kansas State line over the Santa
Fe because of protests made against
taking them to Pueblo or Denver and
leaving them there.

COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo., June
10. â Acting under the orders of Adju
tant General Sherman M. Bell of the
State National Guard, a special train
was made up shortly after noon to-day
in the Short Line yards at Victor for
the deportation of seventy-six union
miners. The train comprised a com
bination baggage car and two day
coaches. Almost immediately the work
of loading the men began. They were
marched to the train between heavy
lines of militia and deputies. A crowd
of fully 1000 people had collected to see
the men placed on board. Among the
spectators were wives and sisters,
fathers and mothers of the deported
men, and the scenes were very affect
ing. Mothers, sisters and sweethearts
cried good-byes and tried to push
through the lines for a parting hand
shake. Most of the women had been
allowed to see their relatives at Arm
ory Hall before the men were marched
out.
LONDON, June 10.â A. J. Nathan of
Pennsylvania, longr a resident of Tan
gier and who has Just arrived in Lon
don, describes the situation In Morocco
generally as being serious. He consid
ers that Perdicaria and Varley are in
the gravest danger. As Ralssouli is
simply a common bandit, the tribes
men are quite beyond his control. If
they thought Raissouli was not acting
squarely they would themselves attack
the captives.
It is certain, Nathan says, that if
marines attempted to march into that
district the prisoners would be killed.
Had Raissouli waited another day he
would have captured United States
Consul General Gummere, who was g".
Ing to visit Perdicaris. Nathan adda
that there is nothing to prevent Rais
souli or any other bandit with a hun
dred men from entering Tangier and
carrying off any diplomatic body, as
the local garrison, numbering 500 men,
is utterly unreliable.
Nathan Says Perdicaris and Varley
Are hi Grave Danger.
FEARS FOR CAPTIVES.
PARIS, June 10. â The Foreign Of
fice has received lengthy advices from
the French Minister at Tangier. He
says Mohammed El Torres, the Sul
tan's representative at Tangier, has
chosen his own son, who bears the same
name as his father, to proceed to the
mountain retreat of Fraissouli, the
bandit chief, and present the final
to secure the release of Perdi
caris and Varley. The son already has
departed on his mission. The Journey
will take a day or two. The officials
expect a successful outcome. They say
Mohammed's choice of his son shows
the sincerity of Morrocco's efforts. The
Minister pays a high tribute to the
cautions reserve and constant courtesy
observed by the American and British
admirals, which is construed as indi
cating that there is no likelihood of
precipitate naval action.
WASHINGTON. June 10.â Rear Ad
miral Chadwlck cabled the Navy De
partment from Tangier to-day that the
captives, Perdicaris and Varley, have
recovered from their illness and there
fore a surgeon from the fleet will not
be sent to Fralssoull's camp.
ST. PAUL. June 10. â John W.
Bowler, chairman of the Hennepin
County Democratic Committee, is in
Ft. Barnabas Hospital, Minneapolis,
as the result of a conference with the
Hearst delegations to-day. During
the conference some one called Bow
ler a liar and a fight ensued. Bowler
was hurt so severely that several
etitches were taken in his lip. The
meeting was held in the interest of
harmony, both factions being: about
equally divided.
The county convention will be held
to-morrow. The assault on Bowler is
expected to react on the iHearst fac
tion. In St. Cloud, Mankato and Blue
Earth counties, where Hearst was said
to have a 'walkover, he will have
scarcely one-fifth of the delegates.
These were the supposed strongholds
of Hearst in Minnesota and there are
enough counties that will send anti-
Hearst delegates to defeat the Xe\v
York Congressman when the State
convention meets on the 21st inst.
Minnesota is surely against Hearst.
Ramsey County, which includes St.
Paul, held its caucuses to-night and
was solidly against Hearst. Money is
paid to have been freely distributed by
the Hearst managers and it was ap
parently easy to secure the primaries
in Minneapolis.

SAN DIEGO, June 10.â It Is under

submitted to the property owners .of
EFCor.dido for the settlement of the
irrigation district muddle. The attor
neys of the land owners, L. A. Wright
and A. Halnea, have been In conference
with the bondholders for the past two
days, and the plan that they have about
agreed upon and which will be sub
mitted to the land owners is the pur
chase of the bonds by the land owners
themselves in quantities they desire
at the rate of $200,000 for $350,000 In
bonds , that were issued. In this way
the Ia/id owners will gradually become
the owners of the bonds and the debt
will eventually be wiped out. In other
words, the lion on the property in the
district will be transferred from Put
nam to the land owners and, with a
lien in their hands, things ought to run

The criminal .career of Arthur R.
Stuart, formerly Deputy Collector of
Customs at Iloilo, Philippines Islands,
has been checked for a time by his
arrest last Thursday at San Antonio,
Tex., on a warrant charging him with
having fraudulently altered" Govern
ment,records while at Iloilo. The ar
rest was made by United States Secret
Service Agent Joseph Priest, who had
been furnished bji United States Secret
Service Agent Hazen of this city with
photographs of Stuart.
The Federal authorities had been
searching for Stuart for a long time
a few mont'hs after he left the Philip
pines. Stuart was reared in San Luis
Obispo, Cal., in which town his father
wajs cashier of a bank. Securing em
ployment with the streetcar company
in Los Angeles in 1892, he embezzled
$1300 from the company, was con
victed In the Superior Court of that
county and sentenced to five years' im
prisonment in the San Quentin peni
tentiary. His sentence was commuted
to two years by "Governor Markham
and In 1895 the prisoner was restored
to citizenship. In 1898 he enlisted
in the Eighteenth United States In
fantry at San Antonio, Tex.; and made
so favorable -an impression upon his
superior officers in the Philippines
that they procured for him -the ap
pointment of Deputy Collector of Cus
toms at Iloilo. .
After leaving the islands he was
given employment in this State by
Dr. B. T. McGIllicudy as Inspector of
the New York Mutual Life Insurance
Company and In the latter part of last
March he absconded with $700 of the
company's money.
Stuart married an estimable young
woman in New Orleans. She died
soon after the marriage and he took
her diamond rings to a pawnshop and
pawned them. He was las"t heard of
at Natchez, .Miss., where he Jumped a
board bill and left his trunk.
Stuart worked for a while for his
uncle, Mr. Hoefler, In the law office
of Bishop, Wheeler & Hoefler in this
city, but his services were dispensed
with, not having been satisfactory.
Stuart will be taken back to the
Philippines for trial. j '/

District Attorney Jerome, In speak
ing of the failure of the Grand Jury to
return an indictment against Mrs. Pat
terson, said:
"I do not believe the Grand JuryhaB
refused to ; render an indictment. In
fact, I know they have notl# I attribute
the fact of not filing an indictment to
some error In presenting the Indict
ment to the foreman of the . Grand
Jury."
William Stemm Jr. was quoted In an
interview this afternoon as saying that
when he mounted the step of the cab
Young appeared to be already dead.
He saw no pistol and Mrs. Patterson
was pate and appeared to be very ner
vous. He said he rode In the cab to the
hoepltaj, where he helped ; carry . the
body and helped MrB. Patterson up the
stairs, but they held no conversation. .
Mrs. Luce tried to reach Mrs. Pat
terson, but was prevented by an of
ficer and was led away.
.A dramatic scene occurred after the
Coroner's hearing, while Mrs. Patter
son was being led back to the Tombs.
Mrs. William Luce, sister of the dead
bookmaker, confronted Mrs. Patterson
and cried out: "You did it!"
If was said to-day thatMn addition
to Mr. and Mrs. J. Morgan Smith an
other witness whom the police consider
of great importance in making a
thorough Investigation of the case hae
mysteriously disappeared. The man is
Harry Frank, a bartender in the saloon
where Young and Mrs. Patterson are
said to have spent a great part of the
night before Young was. shot. Frank
was summoned to appear^ before the
Grand Jury to repeat any conversation
between Young and Mrs. Patterson
which he may have overheard while
they were in the saloon, but he did not
appear, and the. officers were unable to
find him. The examination of all avail
able witnesses was completed by the
Grand Jury during the day. â¢ The Grand
Jury reported this afternoon," but did
not return an indictment against- Mrs.
Patterson. It was reported that if the
case is to be reconsidered by the Grand
Jury it will not be taken, up until some
time next week.
The story that the man who jumped
upon the steps of the carriage fired the
shot which killed Young was further
discredited later in the day, when a
young man told a policeman on the
street that it was he who first ap
proached the cab In which Young and
Mrs. Patterson were riding. The young
man. who said he was William Stemrh
Jr. of Brooklyn, refused to make any
further statement. At his requeRt he
was taken to the District Attorney's
office, where he was at once closeted
with District Attorney Jerome.
FRANK DISAPPEARS.
The Grand Jury to-day continued Its
investigation of the case, and it was
expected that- some conclusion would
be reached before evening. Among the
witnesses examined to-day was a per
son who is said to have actually seen
all that took place in the cab. His name
was not divulged.
There was to have been a Coroner's
hearing to-day in the Young inquest,
but it was postponed until Monday.
Mr. Levy, of counsel for Mrs. Patter
eon, protested against the adjournment.
Before adjournment a Coroner's Jury
was impaneled. .To the Jury Coroner
Brown described the shooting and said
it was doubtful whether the. case was
one of suicide or, homicide. He told
the jury that he expected to get at the
real facts of the case. After Coroner
Brown's description of Young's death
Assistant District Attorney Garvan
asked for an adjournment. Levy, on
behalf of Mrs. Patterson, Insisted that
the Inquiry proceed as required by law.
Coroner Brown said that as the case*
is now being Inquired into "by the
Grand Jury, it was proper that it first
be disposed of -by that body; and while
Garvan only asked for an adjourn
ment until this afternoon. Coroner
Brown said he would put the inquest
over until Monday.
Stern, the pawnbroker who sold .the
revolver found in Young's pocket, in
his testimony before the Grand Jury
said he was positive he could identify
the revolver and the man and woman
to whom he sold It. He w'as given a
view of Mrs. Patterson, but said he
couid not identify her as the woman
who accompanied the man to whom he
sold the revolver. The Grand Jury
expressed a desire, to have Stern con
front J. Morgan Smith, and then it was
learned that Smith had not appeared in
answer to the summons that had been
served on him.
Stern Bald that the" womanWho ac
companied the purphaser of. the re
volver seemed to be much interested in
the weapon and had him show her how
to load, fire and eject the empty shells.
She took the weapon in her hand and
snapped the trigger two^or three times
while pointing it at the floor.
The District Attorney and the attor
neys for Mrs. Patterson are much an
noyed by the many stories brought for
ward by alleged eyewitnesses Uk the
shooting. One of these persons brought
forward a new account to-day, alleg
ing that Young was shot by a man who
jumped to the step of the cab in which
Young and Mrs. Patterson were sitting
and fired at Young over Mrs. Patter
son's shoulder, but this statement re
ceived very little credence.

of arms, for the Irish family is an old
one, the progenitor having settled In

lected to put in a bid for a distinction
undemocratic and wholly at variance
with the ideas of one who sincerely
despises Fhams and conventionalities
of fashion. So, too, former Governor
Markham, Senator Bard, Thomas
Fitch or Lawyer Preston might estab
lish their rights, for all these^ names
are prominent in the American Peer
age Book, as are also the names of
Bidwell, Cutter, Beale, Barnes and

BISHOP NICHOLS REGISTERED.
But the mere presence of a family
name in the Peerage Book does not
signify that all Americans by those
rnrnames are entitled to distinction.
For instance, there are a considerable
number of Smiths in the list and the
book would be completely filled with
Smiths if each were entitled .to the
privilege of registering his name. But
each individual Smith must prove his
right separately and if he is found to
be a direct descendant of Captain John

King Robert Bruce of Scotland, the
mother of Sergeant Francis being Mar

formerly a member of Congress from
Alabama and now a general in the

and is very proud of the distinction. He
submitted to the Genealogical Society a
family record as long as his arm duly
attested, showing he is not only de

can trace his ancestry as far back as
the Norman conquest of England, or to

PREPARE FOR THE FALL
Many Complaints Are Being
; Made .That Weather Is Not
Favorable to Retailers
Edwin T. Ward of Los Angeles is re
lated to the Goulds of New York. The
late Jay Gould was of rather humble
origin. He laid the foundation of hia
fortune by peddling mousetraps. But
Jay Gould was not a descendant of any
of the proud families of England or
Continental Europe. Mrs. Gould, how
ever, was descended ' from Andrew
Ward, who settled at Fairchlld, Conn.
George Jay Gould and his sister Anna,
the Countess Boni de Castellane. are
accordingly entered in the peerage
book on account of their mother's pedi
gree. Thus Mrs. Howard Gould, once
an actress well known in California
as Katherlne Clement, Is also entitled
to registry in the Peerage Book. It hap
pens, too, that Captain Ward of Los
Angeles is related to the Goulds, al
though that fact may be unknown even
to himself.
Major Otis Wheeler Pollock, U. S. A.,
of Alameda is a descendant of Charles
Pollock, who came from Renfree and
whose arms were granted in 1672. Coat

in the* work that is in progress on the
old Red Ledge mine at French Corral.
The Grass Valley Union says that it
looks as if the ledge contains a large
copper deposit, and in part the Union
reports: t
Lode miners are curious to see just what
there is to the Red Ledge. If It Is a copper
mine It Is the biggest thing in copper In
this nart of California. As It Is only one
mile from French Corral that ancient placer
digging camp is In hopes that the development
of . the . Red Ledge will be proeecuted with
vigor. The turfneilng to the mine Is atl done
from the steep slope of the hill, and No. 6
Is at a point about midway between the top
of the hill and the base at the tied of the
South Yuba River. Eventual backs -,can he

tures from outside parties for the erection of
a smelter or reduction works suitable for
the ore of the Red Ledge, and from all present
Indications Nevada County, through the Red
Ledge mine, bids fair at no very distant date
to rank as an Important copper producer. -
2 A small portion Of the material which
came down might have been due to dredge .
operation, the actual quantity depending upon
the manner In which the few dredgers In the
bed of the stream were operated.
3. Dredge mining can bÂ« so conducted and
without detriment to the industry as to offer
not the slightest menace to river or to farm-
Ing lands. Supervision by the Debris Commis
sion and certain restrictions to which the
dredgers say they will cheerfully assent will
prevent any deposit going into the stream.
4. The seven dredges now In the stream are
probably operating without material Injury to
the river unless it be demonstrated that the
cobbles and heavy gravel deposited bjr the
"stackers" are moved by flood waters down
stream. No other material Injury certainly
could be ascribed to the operations of the
two river dredges farthest down stream, which
were personally and thoroughly Inspected.
5. The dredges as at present operating leave
behind them an ugly trail of cobbles and
gravel, piled fifteen to twenty feet high. In
the bed of the stream this Is apparently an
advantage, since It provides a barrier of
Ip-egular surface which catches and hold* de>
,poslts from above, brought down In flood sea
son and also holds, permanently imprisoned
below It. the silt and heavy sand which the
dredges themselves take up from the river bed
and which otherwise might be washed down
stream. When working in agricultural land,
however, the dredges turn fertile soil Into a
waste of cobbles which will so remain for
centuries. This undoubtedly will prove In time,
a detriment to communities thus Injured and
to the county through loss or assessable prop
erty. This evil can be ~- remedied if success
attends experiments now being made tor eco
nomically depositing the silt on top of the
cobbles Instead of below them.
A one-third interest In the Mammoth
mine in" Shasta County has' been sold,

have under bond the other two-thirds
of the property. Mrs. Wallace is re
ported to have received for her share
$42,000. The Mammoth mine is a copper
property in the Backbone district. It
Includes 900 acres of land.
COPPER IX /NEVADA.
Several conclusions have been
reached, after a careful investigation
by the Sacramento Bee, of the condi
tions relating to dredger mining and its
effect on the streams below where the
operations are carried on that will be
the subject of more or less discussion.
They are given herewith In brief for
what they may be worth: Â»
Â¦ 1~ The deposits of, heavy sand brought down
by the river, this past seaÂ«on could not have
been due in more' than part to dredge mining.
This was sufficiently demonstrated by the ex
istence of similar deposits carried out of the
river at points above where the dredges were
operating. The past was an exceptional fiocui
season and matter was brought down the river
which In ordinary seasons would not have been
disturbed Â¦
DREDGER MINE PROBIjEMS.
Two transfers of mining properties in
Nevade County are made public. The
owners of the Blue Tent" mine have
bought from Gilbert Hall the Grizzly
Hill gravel claim, which lies on the
north side of the South Yuba River.
The Canada Hill group of mines has
been sold to J. F. Llttlefleld of San
Francisco. This group was owned by
George C. Gaylord. The properties are
collectively known as the Charconnet
mine. According to the Graes Valley
Union, work will soon be resumed at
the Charconnet. The property was first
acquired by L. Charconnet and his sons
in 1878. Under the managemeni of the
Charconnets the operations were quite
extensive.
In six months after they took posses
sion they earned enough, so it is locally
reported, to pay for the sinking of an
Incline 250 feet in depth, to erect hoist
ing works and a ten-stamp mill, and
prior to 1887 they took out 20,000 tons
of excellent ore. When the formation
was reached that was unprofitable to
work with the mining processes that
were then in vogue, operations were
suspended. The present deal and the
operations that are promised would
seem to Indicate that the expectation
Is that more economical methods will
yield profit.
The Grand Vein mine, a ledge prop
erty, was worked for a time by a
French company, and a tunnel was run
1200 feet and hoisting works were
erected, but work was suspended on
account of the heavV flow of water.
The Grand ledge, which is Included in
the properties, is reported to be of low
grade ore. There are two hoisting rigs
on the property, one being on the Char
connet mine and the other on the
Grand. They are connected by a pipe
line running from a reservoir below
the South Yuba ditch. Large figures
are given by the Nevada County papers
concerning the money that has been
taken from the Charconnet. To ascer
tain how much remains of treasure de
posits will now be the work In hand
for the new owners of the property.
Concerning the Grizzly Hill property,
the Nevada County Miner says in part:
The Grizxly Hill was operated to some ex
tent In early times by the hydraulic process.
The new owners will work" It by the drifting
process, and It Is admirably tltuated In regard
to tunnel and millsites Clifford Graham, the
superintendent of the Blue Tent mine, will
have the general direction of the development

brewery drivers' union, is reported
missing from his office and his home.
With his - sudden disappearance It Is
said a shortage in his accounts was dis
covered amounting to 53000. The exact
amount cannot be positively ascer
tained,-because of the. secretion or. de
struction of his books. His method of
getting away with the funds- of the
union, it Is said, was in substituting
due stamps printed In this city instead
of using the regular stamps furnished
from the Eastern association office.
Gus Frankel has been appointed secre
tary pro tern.

that went around the sheds conducted
themselves in an orderly manner.

ber of the carriage firms may llnd it

I would like to tabulate the requirements of
an actor's art as follows: First, character;
second the management of hly career; third.
to keep himself simple nn<l natural; fourth,
alertness, watching the actions of life; fifth.
Incessant work.
Granting an actor Is innately one and has
the natural gifts of a pleasing appearance,
magnetism, and Inspiration â what then? I
would place character at the head of the re
quirements for stage success. A great man
character Is a gentleman at hÂ«-art. He < will
live In a plane of high thinking and low liv
ing. He will have sane methods; he will
breathe a good personality over the footlights:
he will take pleasure In the simple things of
life, and will aid the drama on the road to
ennoblement. Character is the essence that
defies temptation, laxity and-. the diversions
that are the pitfalls. Character will Instill
concentration. To keep one's self "simple and
fresh and young at heart Is the duty of the
actor, Rnd sanity, health and that feeling Ib
sen expresses aa "the Joy of life" are th<j
things our drama will always need. " .
The management of his career ts as great a
necessity to an actor as are his natural gifts
Â¦ s an artist. There are theme who. In their
dreamy search for the artistic, overlook the
practical *Me of life, the part that Is neces
sary for . all men to keep strictly In view.
There is a debit and credit Fide to every man's
career. It Is necesBary for him to keep a sort
of set of, spiritual books, keep his balance. If
possible, always oa the side of profit. An
actor's career !Â» his stock In trade. It Is the
merchandise 'with which he loads his ehelf.
It is hln very work. It Is the thing he Is to
get his credit from. â¢ It represents hln toll. It Is
well to take an Inventory of his career very
often to see where hÂ» has succeeded â to note
where he has failed. When one has done
this one will lenrn at once the value of Integ
rity, without which success In no walk of life
can be gained.
There has been much ado at certain time*
over what has been termed the artificiality of
the actor's art â a cry that he leads an unnat
ural life, that his whole life's' work consists
in dissembling and assuming a thing which is
net. Well, what of all that? ThÂ« painter does
not plac; upon hi* canvas the real effects of
the sky; the sculptor simply reproduces - th<i
pose of life. Insenseless marble; the orator
commands thought through figments of speech ;
the actor's art calls for him In his own per
son to become a thing which exists at first
merely in his brain, but that Is his art â to
make unrealities, real, to simulate nature so
well that It seems nature â these. are the dif
ficulties always to be borne foremost in mind
and to bend the energies ppon an ability to
create a perfect illusion, If one would endeavor
to succeed. â¢ ' '
CHARACTER IS NECESSARY.
I have always contended that the actor's
art embraces all the other arts. â¢ Â¦ In his own
being he brings out the effects aimed at In
the color emotions of the painter. In the prose
emotions of the sculptor, In the thought emo
tions of the writer. In the soul emotions of
the poet. In the magnetic emotions of the ora
tor. He Incorporates theÂ«e In a composite
whole In bin work and reflects them In him
self. The laws of success In each of these
branches of art enter of a necessity Into, the
art of the actor.
INCLUDES ALL ARTS.
The drama, now enlisting the earnest atten
tion of all. classes of material, conditions and
mental capacity, enrolling In Its devotees the
best thought and energies of the thousands,
has become a force that is dally . being reck
oned with more and more.' How to succeed as
an actor, how to pay the warmest tribute to
tha drama, bow to give to the public the
greatest results of the actor's efforts, are sub
jects worthy of close attention from the best
minds. â¢ â¢ Â¦Â¦.Â»â¢
â¢ Edward H. Sothern, the noted actor,
who is to appear In this city next week,
was recently asked the following ques
tion: "Provided an actor has the or
dinary accomplishments of a well-bred
person, what must he do to climb to
the top of the profession?" In reply
Mr. Sothern answered In part as fol
lows:
In every profession, trade, occupation, to
whatever man lays his hands or utilizes his
brain and energy, to whatever is worth while,
the question of how. to achieve. the highest
possible result, to viÂ« with some master, to
succeed, la to-day the all-engrossing thought
of men and women.

WASHINGTON. June 10.â The Phil

that he believed that legislation which
was pending in Congress and which
was greatly needed would be parsed In
some modified form during the coming

humorous allusions to his experience in
the islands. He assured the delegates
that the people of the United States
were much interested. in the progress
and welfare of tbe people of the Philip
pine Islands. Dr. Tavara responded to
the Secretary's remarks and said sev
eral complimentary things about the

â¢ In the letter Stickney said that ow
ing to the unfortunate condition of bis
wife, her mind being sadly deranged,
he had determined to kill her and him
self, as he desired to go with her. He
further stated that he left his ranch
to a sister living in the East.

from several colleges and universities.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, June 10.â C.
Wade Stickney of this place shot and
killed his wife* early this morning and
then slew himself.' , The tragedy has
shocked the community, as both were
people of refinement and very popu
lar. Stickney had been despondent
about the health of his wife. Efforts
here to restore her health having failed,
she went East some time ago. Re
cently she returned, but her condition
showed no Improvement. This fact
evidently preyed on the mind of her
husband and drove him to the rash
act.
.This morning about 4 o'clock her con
dition was such that her physician was
called. About 7 o'clock a neighbor vis
ited the house and found both dead. A
pistol and a note, writtenJiy Stickney,
told the story of the tragedy.

he sought.
Since that time D'Montlspan has re
sided in luxury at the Baden resort.
The proferred hospitality of the wo
man was not refused and his bene
factress basked In the sunshine of his
emJles and found contentment in his
company. Yesterday she found she had
Jost in a game of folly. The French
xr.an had flown and with him went all
cf her precious belongings. Her apart
ments had been ransacked. The Jewelry
that had survived the sale for his lib
erty was gone and even the pawn
tickets were net overlooked. The child
accompanied its father. .
Now Mrs. Hodges cries vengeance.
Ehe eays that her loss will figure in
the thousands and she wants the thief
prosecuted. Detectives Bunner and
Freel were detailed by Captain Martin
to apprehend him. The Etory Is told at
police headquarters that D'Montispan
has a wife living in Texas, but that he
deserted her some time ago. His father
is president of a network of railroads
In France and Switzerland and is rated
as being one of the most wealthy men
in Paris.
Sirs. Kate Hodges, proprietress of a
summer resort at Baden, tells the tale
of mercy given and of a rude awaken
ing. At the Hall of Justice last night
â¢he assumed a much different atti
tude toward the handsome French
man than when she visited the place
en previous occasions to cheer his
hours behind prison bars and to plead
his innocence to the authorities. This
time the asked sympathy for herself
;when she mentioned the theft of sev
eral thousand dollars' worth of gems
6-r.d other chattels and Invoked the
Strong arm of the law In placing the
accused thief in the dungeon from
jrhich she had once rescued him.
Mrs. Hodges met D'Montispan shortly
before he was arrested In this city on
a charge of burglary. He was good to
look upon, suave of manner, bore
&ir cf refinement and satisfied his
claim to noble birth and gentle rear-
Ing. Besides he had a little girl on
whom he showered much tenderness
fend all these circumstances tended to
ttlr up pity and affection in the heart
cf the Baden woman. When D'Monti-
Epan was accused of crime she went
to his aid. caring for his little daugh
ter and offering her Jewels for sale
that he might be free again.
Many times she visited him In the
City Prison, offering words of hope
and when she was away from him her
energies were bent on securing his re
lease. Jewel after Jewel went to the
pawnshop until the sum became suffi
cient for the purpose of his defense,
but she felt gladness at her sacrifice
â¢when a technicality of the law came to
the prisoner's rescue and he walked
from the court room a free man.
Allan E. d'Montlspan, scion of
French nobility, outcast son of the
president of one of the greatest Euro
pean railway eystems and a former
sergeant major in the United States
army, has turned rogue in the fold of
his friends. The luxury that a. woman
bestowed upon him when he was In
seed and the assistance she rendered
in keeping him without prison walls
â¢eems only to have been rewarded with
deepest ingratitude and the pride of his
noble lineage proved no barrier to the
touch of crime.
The case is the second to be brought
under the law enacted by the last Leg
islature making it illegal to import
strike-breakers into any district by
false representations. Ackerman 3ent

KINDLY SPEECH
SAN JOSE. June 10.â A platform on
which 400 children were seated on
Victory Theater stage gave way dur
ing a rehearsal this afternoon. The
entire chorus was thrown to the floor.
That some were not killed Is almost
miraculous. About a dozen of the chil
dren were injured, but none seriously.
Edith Tran was cut about the face, and
Minnie Wlthrow received bruises and
cuts on one of her limbs. The rest of
the children hurt received only bumps
and scratches.
Frank Stevens, a stage hand, received
a fracture of the skull by being struck
by some of the timbers. A panic was
only averted by the presence of mind
of Milton L. Lawrence, who was di
recting the rehearsal. He succeeded In
quieting the children.
The rehearsal was for a children's
concert to be given in aid of the Home
of Benevolence. They had Just finished
the rehearsal and were about to leave
their seats when the crash came. The
concert was successfully given this
evening.

sor Stubenrauch has reconsidered the
resignation he- tendered President
Wheeler a month ago and will con

It is understood that President
Wheeler was enabled to offer such in

as prevailed upon him to remain with
the University of California. The ad
vice of his friends and the fact that
his family and all his business inter
ests are centered in California helped
to Influence him to reconsider his
resignation. His resignation was
prompted in the first place by the
great amount of work his position en
tails. His attention was divided among
four or five important activities, de

he had little time for himself. Now
some arrangement will be made by
which the duties of the office will be

As far- an sÂ»ie lÂ« concerned, I have no ob

young man has been wayward and does not
deserve any further klndneMea, He haÂ« been

We have been trying to .break off this habit,
but tie has never been .willing to comply with

and we are sortly disappointed.. .
"Then if he should come back to your
home you would not forgive him and
take him back again?" Mr. Lunlng
was asked.
"No."
Mrs.' Luning. who was sitting beside
her husband, was asked:
Papa Luning is mad clear through.
He declares with much vehemence that
he' will not permit his* son to cross the
threshold if he should return with hl3

The Buttons are not so minded. They
will accept their child and the man of
her choice with a "bless you, my chil

Oscar Luning declares that he has no
particular objection to the former Miss
Haas as a daughter-in-law, but he does
seriously rebel against the manner of
his son's nuptials. Said Luning to
night:
My eon has done wrong and I will never
welcome him to thlx house again. He has
gone aKainet my wishes, and I am thoroughly
disappointed In his conduct.. The young lady's
family is all right In every way. and I am
well acquainted with her father and mother.
You must know that such a shock is terrible
to me and to my wife. While our hearts go

does not deserve forelyenei!*, -aa he was well

OAKLAND, June 10.â The elopement
of Nicholas Lunlng. son of Millionaire
Oscar Luning. who resides at 3S55 Tele
graph avenue, and Miss Ethel Haas,
the. stepdaughter of Attorney Fred L.
Button, has caused no little excitement
among society circles of Oakland. The
first intimation that the parents of
either of the parties had was a tele
phone message informing' them that
the two runaways had been married.
The message came from Sacramento.
It is a fact that the couple have been
married and are now together^.. though
their present whereabouts is not known
by either of the parents of the elopers.
There was no warnlng : given to the
parents of either that they were" about
to marry, and though they have been
well acquainted for some time it. was
not thought that they were contemplat
ing matrimony. Miss Haas informed
her mother on Wednesday that she was
going to San Francisco, and received
permission to go. The next informa
tion that the family had was a tele
phone message stating that she had
been married to young Lunlng.
Young Nick Luning had been much
in the company of his wife for. several
months since his return from a mili
tary academy at Lexington, Va. Before
he reappeared Miss Haas that was had
been a frequent visitor at the Luning
residence and was. a close companion
of Mrs. Luning, who had taken more
than a passing . fancy to her young
friend. Easy enough was it for the re
turned son to find opportunity to en
gage the attention of his mother's
charming visitor. And the romance
once begun was hastened along until
it ended in the runaway match, the
wedding at a Baptist parsonage In the
capital ciu/ Wednesday and the brief
but startling announcement over the
wires.
I would without a doubt. The young man
to my mind Is well brought up and a man of
refinement. I can see no reason why the two
should not fee happy. They undoubtedly love
*ach other and. though I do, not think that
they should have married now, I am thor
oughly convinced that it is a case of true love.
They havo been paying attention to each other
for some time and, though I did not object to
the young man calling upon our daughter, I
had no Idea that the result would be as It is.
1 did not learn .until very recently that . my
wife had the confidence of our daughter but
I am told now that Ethel's love had already
been told to her mother and that she could s<e
nothing but Js'lchi^as and the' hoped to marry
him. We 'offer no objection, as we consider
that the young man Is thoroughly worthy of
her affection. They are welcome at our home
whenever they chooee to come to iis.
"Would you allow your daughter to
return to your house under the exist
ing circumstances?" Mr. Button was
asked. He said:
I do not care to make any statement In re
gard to the case further than that the two
yr.ung people have selected their own road to
travel and they must do the best they can.
Though I am greatly surprised that my daugh
ter should choose the course that she did, I
am willing to give her all the love that a
father's heart can convey.
The Button family reside at 856 Thir
ty-fourth street. Mr. Button had this
to say to-night:
A HUMAN VIEW.
"Would you take him back, Mrs.
Luning?"
"He is our only son, sir," came the
reply from the mother between sobs.

The police to-night located Carl
Boehle, Joseph Soares, Manuel Soares
and Manzie Roderick, boys who came
frqm Sacramento with Rhodes. Joseph
Soares saw Rhodes struck by the
Berkeley local train. Soares said he
yelled at Rhodes, but the boy became
confused and stepped back on the
track. Though satisfied that Rhodes'
death was N accidental, the detectives
cannot explain Cody's peculiar state
ments. The police definitely learned
t,hat Cody was in Sacramento ' when
Rhodes was killed.
After the newsboy detectives ' had
trailed Cudy, who gave a raise address
to elude the Coroner, he did'not want
to go before that official, although Cody
had told the newsboys he had witness
ed young Rhodes' death.
With his contradictions to-day the
imprisoned youth offers no satisfactory
excuses.
"I was frightened and didn't want to
talk about it," was Cody's reason yes
terday for not reporting to the Cor
oner. To-day he simply upsets his
own story and, lets the investigating
officials take It for what it Is worth.
Dr. C. E. Curdts, Dr. J. M. Kane and
Dr. George C. Reinle held an autopsy
to-day in the case of Rhodes. They
found no evidence of injury that of It
self would indicate foul play. Death
was caused by hemorrhage of the
lungs, produced by the penetration
from a fractured rib, three of which
were found to have been broken.
Mrs. .Eleanor Rhodes, mother of the
dead newsboy, arrived to-day from Los
Angeles and requested Coroner Mehr
mann to make all necessary Inquiry
concerning her son's death.
Until after the Inquest to-morrow
afternoon, at least, Cody will be de
tained at the City Prison.
OAKLAND, June 10.â The police are
puzzled over the case of young Samuel
Rhodes, the newsboy, whose body was
found Wednesday night on the South
ern Pacific Company's tracks at West
Oakland. William Cody, the striking
boilermaker's heloer, who claimed to
have seen Rhodes killed and who gave
a circumstantial statement last evening
to Coroner Mehrmann concerning the
manner in which he says his com
panion met death, startled the defec
tives to-day by denying the truth of
his sworn deposition to the Coroner.
Cody said to-day that he had not seen
Rhodes killed, but that all of the Infor
mation he had concerning the news
boy's death he had gleaned Thursday
from boya who had told him about
Rhodes' death. The" identity of his In
formants Cody claims he does not
know, but that they live in Oakland
and that he can find their homes, the
detained young man avers.
Contradictions also arise as to the
movements of Rhodes and Cody. The
prisoner told the Coroner that he and
the dead boy left Sacramento together
and left the freight train on which they
had ridden at the same time. Cody
claimed they were standing on the
tracks Wednesday night when the
Berkeley train struck the boy and
killed him. Now comes his story that
he separated from Rhodes at Suisun
and arrived here Wednesday morning,
while Rhodes was not killed until
Wednesday night.
Out of the maze of unreliability that
has developed as a strong element in
Cody's statements the Coroner and the
police are at sea. No motive for a
crime can be found, nor would sus
picion be directed toward Cody had not
his own actions yesterday given rise
to the idea that something might be
wrong.

/ The case of the Salvador Commercial
Company consisted of a claim against
Salvador for unlawful confiscation of
its concessions and properties gained
as successor to El Trlfuno Company,
which established extensive shipping
interests in Salvador. Colonel Irish, in
1S99, was retained to press the com
pany's demands before the State De
partment. He succeeded not only In
interesting the United States Govern
ment, but in procuring tne negotiation
of a treaty by which Salvador agreed
to the submission of the claims to a
board of arbitration. The board was
composed of Sir Henry Strong, Chief
Justice of Canada; Don M. Dickinson.
United States Minister to Salvador, and
Dr. Don Jose Roca Pacas, Salvador's
Minister to the United States. The
final settlement netted the company
5428,000.
No answer was filed in the suit, the
purpose of which was to procure the
adjustment of matters upon which the
Union National -Bank, trustee of the
money recovered from Salvador, could
not pass judgment, as they required
either an agreement of the parties or
the decree of court. Settlement of fhe
differences ia accepted by the parties
concerned as a matter" of congratula
tion. It leaves the famous interna
tional controversy as a precedent for
the protection of Americans in Latin
America undimmed by the Incidents
of litigation between the parties and
the attorney, who established the pre
cedent.
The auit of Colonel John P. Irish to
recover 1100,000 fees for his services in
winning the case of the Salvador Com
mercial .Company against the Govern
ment -of Salvador has been dismissed,
a settlement having been effected out
of court to the satisfaction of those
interested. It Is understood that Col
ohel Irish received 530,000 from the
company, plug an amount not stated
from others who were Interested in the
case. . â¢ ,

After the petty larceny charge
apainst Price was dismissed he was
notified to appear next Thursday after
noon at 4 o'clock to be arraigned on a
charge Of grand larceny preferred by
F. \Y. Lowe. In default of bail Price
will be confined la the County Jail. He
is represented by Atto-rney Creed of
Han Francisco.
I do rot believe from what this younc man
say* that he came here from Calaveras County
of bis own free will. I am satisfied that he
vac brought here by this man James through
intimidation and that James resorted to fraud
anj wrongTnlly used and abused a warrant
it rued out of this court in order to force Price
to pay & debt. It Is one of the most dls
rraceful ax:ts of a man who claims to bÂ«
an s.ttorney that I ever heard of In my Ufa.
I will hold that the warrant waa not properly
served and will recall It. The charse of
Ittty larceny epa-.r.M Price I will dismiss,
l: is the first time that such an unheard
*nd unlawful abuse has been made of a war
rant from my court and it will never occur
â¢Â«ain if I can prevent It.
The thought of it has almost made me
forget my Judicial diirnity and step down .from
thÂ» bench and impose something more upon
the party guilty or the act than a verbal
?.Â£.ylryr. The whole scheme was diabolical on
Clc lÂ»art cf this man James, and while I have
n Â¦> sympathy for Price, who. it appears, has
deTrautied many creditors. I mean to protect
the defendant in full accordance with the law.
ALAMEDA. June 10.â Howard K.
James, a local bill collector, and his
illegal action in compelling George L.
Price to accompany him from Burson
in Calaveras County on a warrant
which James had no authority to serve
and then keeping Price in his private
penitentiary for three days" for debt,
while endeavoring to persuade the
prisoner's relatives to raise the coin
needed, were vigorously scored from
the bench by City Justice R. B. Tap
pan this afternoon. Price was present
in court, but James had business else
where and was not in attendance to
hear what his Honor said about him.
Price was ordered to taKe the stand
and after being put under oath related,
at the request of Judge Tappan. how-
James had imposed upon nim. When
Price concluded his narration Judge
Tappan said: ,
'. Only through the Intervention of the
police and a neighbor, Mrs. Baker, at
910 Third street, did the dreadful con
dition of the neglectful sufferer come
to light. Demand was made upon the
old woman two days ago that ehe
admit a caller) Mrs. Baker, who had
become alarmed about her eccentric
neighbor. . The only reply was refusal
to open the door.
Then the police were called and
threatened to break into the hovel un
less they were admitted. With that
Miss Hyde crawled from her bed and
unbarred the entrance.
Dr. J. F. Rlnehart was summoned
and after examining the then dying
woman ordered her to be removed im
mediately to the hospital. She was
too much weakened and lived until
this afternoon. The Coroner took
charge of the body. Public Adminis
trator George Gray found among the
old woman's effects a bank book show
ing a deposit of $4000 in the Oakland
Bank of Savings and a deed of owner
ship to the Third-street place. A
brother is said to reside In San Fran
cisco. V
Taken . t roVn a syualid j hovel in a
frightful physical condition, one arm
having been eaten by rats, Kate Hyde,
75 years old, died to-day at the Provi
dence Hospital . from starvation.
Though she had thousands of dollars
in. bank and possessed title to the
homo at 1018 Third street, In which
she dwelt, the aged woman preferred
her life of miserly seclusion, where
she refused to receive or be seen by
ajiy one. . - . . , ... â¢

Movements of Steamers.
The Nebraakan's actual steaming
time was fifty-two days ten hours,
which is one of the smartest passages
ever made by the vessels of this line.
The Nebraskan's run was watched
with special interest by the naval au
thorities and the Buccess of the ex
periment will do much toward
awakening official interest in the mod
ern fuel.
The American-Hawaiian Steam
ship Company's freighter Nebraskan,
Captain Weeden, surprised the ship
ping world yesterday by plowing in
through " the Golden Gate, fifty-four
days from Xew York, and three or
four days before she was looked for.
The Nebraskan, before leaving here,
was converted into an oil burner and
has demonstrated the practicability of
liquid fuel for very long voyages. The
Oceanic Steamship Company was the
first on this coast to demonstrate the
value of oil as fuel for ocean-going
steamers and the oil-burning liner
Mariposa has for many months been
running between her! and Tahiti with
the regularity of clockwork.
The Marlposa's round trip is only
about 74&0 miles, however, and in
spite of her good showing there re
mained many who doubted the prac
ticability of liquid fuel on longer runs.
The objection to attempting the New
Tork to San Francisco run with an
oil-burner was the absence of supply
stations along the roiite. ' The Ne
braskan has proved that supply sta
tions are not necessary. The course
from New York to San Francisco . as
taken by the Nebraskan is 13,150
miles, or nearly twice as long as the
distance traveled by the Mariposa In
making the round trip to Tahiti.
,The Nebraskan left New Tork with
enough fuel to bring her all the way
â¢to San Francisco and in addition car
ried a cargo of 5000 tons of general
merchandise. She made only one stop
on the entire run and that was in the
Straits of Magellan and necessitated
by the weather. From the river
Platte to the straits the Nebraskan
bucked a continuous gale, but made
good headway in spite of it.

Santa Cruz, when the new Tented City,
Casino and pleasure pier will be dedi
cated. Excursions are to be' run and

ance of an oriental city. -The Casino is
an imposing bit of architecture in
Moorish design.
The place is fitted up with . a roof
garden, on which will. be served re
freshments. The prevailing colors are
buff with green trimmings. - The main
floor downstairs is fitted up for conces
sions, penny arcades and barber shop.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
The commission formally accented
the Earl Curhmings fountain in front
of the conservatory. Golden Gate
Park.
Commissioner Lloyd announced that
fÂ»x-Judge Murphy had drawn an or
dinance re-enacting and vitalizing or
dinances hitherto adopted. The new
order was read and laid over until the
next meeting of the board.
Commissioner Altman spoke of an
interview he recently had with Paul
Steindorf in reference to choral socie
ties singing at the park. It was the
yense of the board that Director Stein
dorf should enlist the services of sing
ers. A temporary platform will be
erected at the music concourse.
Acknowledgment was made of
many contributions to. the memorial
museum. Commissioner Lloyd gives
to the park several rare and valuable
coins and also a gold bronzed copy of
the London Mail, Queen's jubilee edi
tion. The number contains a fac
*im:Ie of the paper issued at the iime
of th<? Queen's coronation.
Joseph Cleary, acting superintend
ent, was directed to warn pedestrians
r gainst using paths assigned to wheel-
The superintendent's report for the
month of May states that the under
ground reservoir near the Dutch wind
mill en the ocean beach has been
T\idened an d deepened so that it will
supply 500,000 gallons of water a day.
During the month of May seven miles
of roadway, fifty feet wide, was oiled.
The profits of the Children's Play
ground for the month of March were
JH34. The receipts amounted to
$3752 tO.
Th* Japanese Tea Garden for the
same month returned a profit of J125 SI.
Commissioner Dingee called the
board's attention to the neglected con
dition of the garden and Commissioner
Altman was requested to look to the
premises.
In anticipation of the award of
yearly contracts for supplies the San
Francisco Labor Council sent to the
hoard a list of "unfair" houses with
a request that such houses be not pat
ronized. The Commissioners ruled
that the charter required award to the
lowest responsible bidder.
Park Commissioners Reuben H.
LJoyd, A. Altmaa and W. J. Dingee at
tended a regular meeting of the board
at Mr. Lloyd's office yesterday after
noon. Commissioner Dingee was called
to the chair in the absence of A. B.
Fpreckels, president of the commission.
A. S. Campbell, representing residents
of the Ocear.side district, south of the
park, requested the widening of the
boulevard south of H Etreet. He re
ported that the automobiles traveled
rapidly en that section of the boulevard.
ThÂ« pace at night was terrific* he said.
He also asked for a driveway from the
intersection of H street and Forty
foventh avenue to the park. The board
â¢Took the requests under advisement.
J. H. Todd, speaking for the members
of the Model Yacht Club, frankly in
formed the Commissioners that ma
terial aid in the construction of the
proposed house at- Spreckels Lake
could not be provided by the club. The
amount so far contributed is less than
SSOO. A structure costing 514,000 is con
tomplatefi by the board. The Commis
sioners were told at the outset that
Commodore I. Gutte and. other promis
ing yachtsmen would raise a large sum
of money to aid the enterprise. The
subject was postponed for further con
sideration.

American marksmen/ hold their honor in such high
esteem that, rather than aJccept a trophy from BVitish
competitors who were beaten in K a recent contest and

fortified any way by the conviction that the victory may

ONLY a few months ago the critics of President
Roosevelt were loudly deploring the fact, which
they assumed, that he was putty, in the hands of

manded a man for President who would not only man
age his own campaign, but run his own, administration.

Diaz and Mexico.
In the marvelous development of
Mexico in the past generation Diaz has
played the leading part. Among the
foremost achievements of the existing
.Mexican government must be counted
the founding of a national school
system, free from sectarian influence.
The strong hand of the President is
also seen in the marvelous regeneration
of the capital city, which is now
drained by the greatest piece of
sanitary engineering in the world, ai\d
which is being rapidly modernized in
the matter of good, pavements, parks
public buildings and canals.
Another great achievement of â¢ the
Diaz administration has been the Im
provement of Mexican harbors on the
Gulf and the 'Pacific. The latter fact
is especially notable in the instance of
th<> Tehuantepec route. By this high
way goods in transit from Atlantic
ports to California have an advantage
; of, 1500 miles over the proposed Panama
i canal." . r '

Has Kuroki French Blood?
Several French soldiers, survivors of
the Chineese expedition of 1856. are
responsible for the statement that
General Kuroki, who is leading the
Japanese forces in Manchuria, is in
reality, half French. His name, they
say. is properly spelled Curique. Ac
cording to the story of these soldiers,
a French officer, Captain Curique,
while serving in China in 1S56. mar
ried a Japanese girl. A son was Jaorn
to them, who was given the Japanese
name Kuroki, corresponding to the
French Curique. The son is General

the Kaiser's birthday, will probably be
chosen as the exact date, as the cathe
dral is the Kaiser's personal project,
initiated by him shortly arter he came
to the throne. The magnificent edifice,
which stands in the Lustgarten direct
ly opposite the north entrance of the
royal castle, has been building for
eleven "years, the cornerstone having
been laid in June, 1894, and it repre
sents a cost of nearly $3,000,000. The
Kaiser planned originally. to spend 5.1,
000,000, but the Prussian legislature de
cided to vote only half that amount of
state funds for the purpose.
Of German white sandstone and
heroic Roman architecture, the new
Cathedral will be a fitting addition to
Berlin's . many fine public structures.
The dome of the building rises to the
commanding height of 305 feet, and it
will be surmounted by a gigantic gold
en crucifix, 30 feet high. Four hand
some bell towers rise at each corner
of the almost square building to a
height 51 197 feet. The magnificent ex
terior effect Is Mill further heightened
by a series of marble statues, set In
niches or adorning the coping ,at var
ious points.' Above the main entrance
to the cathedral is a statue in copper
of the Savior, 20 feet -In height, exe
cuted by the well known- Berlin sculp
tor, Professor Schapef. The architects
of the cathedral, which Is certain to
rank as one of the great fanes of con
tinental Europe, are Proressor Julius
Raschdorff and his son of Berlin.
The new cathedral is the successor of
the old Berlin "Dora" anfl stands on
the selfsame spot. Tlje ancient struc
ture, which was razed to make room
for the new, was 200 years old. It had
been the traditional resting place of
Â«U the Hohenzollern Kings, with few
exceptions, together with their <:on
gorts and offspring. The new cathe
dral has risen over their sepulchers,
which were restored and covered be
fore the foundations of the present
Â¦tructure were finally laid. Frederick
the Great and the Kaiser's grand
father, Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse, are
not buried \ in the "Dom," but com
memorative sepulchers in their honor,
es well as in honor of Bismarck,
Moltke, Goethe, Schiller and many
other great Germans, will probably be
erected in the new cathedral. Empercr
William intends that it shall be the
fame sacred shrine for Germans that
Westminster Abbey is for .English
men. Â¦ ;.. ... .
The interior of^the cathedral is in
keeping, of course? with its palatial ex
terior. Magnificent mural paintings by
Professor Anton von âWerner,, Ger
many's first living artist, will be the
chief feature. Biblical
scenes representing " the life of Christ
will appear in the interior, of the dome.

lft he attracted the attention of Mar
quis Kuroda, one of the richest and
most powerful of the old Daimios of
Japan, who. determined to provide for
his education. arrd sent him in 1871 to
Boston. After v h.is studies at the Rice
School and the English High School,
young Kaneko entered the law offlce
of Messrs. Gray & Swift, his v work
there being largely directed by Oliver

secretary to Marquis (then Count)
Ito and was appointed on the commis

following year, continuing in the sarn-.>
line of work, he was on the commis
sion to reorganize the administrative
departments of the Government* For
the service thus rendered, on the pro
mulgation of the constitution he was
rewarded with the decoration of the
Order of the Sacred Treasure. "V:-',
In 1889, receiving an appointment
as imperial commissioner to study the
actual workings of parliamentary .in
stitutions, he traveled extensively in
Europe and America, and- on his re
turn, as chief secretary o< the House
of Peers, superintended the organiza
tion of the new Japanese Parliament.
In 1892, having been elected a mem
ber of the Institute of International
Law, 'Mr. Kaneko attended the meet
ing in Geneva, where hij plea for the
abolition of extraterritoriality was in
fluential in determining the favorable
vote of the institute. In 1894, be?
coming .Vice Minister of Agrlzulture
and Commerce, he was again honored
by the Emperor with an appointment
as life member, of the House of Peers
and received the, additional decoration
of the'Order of the Rising_ Sun. Re
signing his office on a charge of min
istry in 1898, when Xfarquls Ito again
came into power, Mr. Kaneko entered
his cabinet a.s Minister pf Agriculture

til the premier again retired. - Since
then he has been Mayor of one of the
Tokio municipalities.

called down the wrath of judgment
upon his head. The Chinaman had just
set a pile of steaming "bucks" on the
table, and the Italian immediately
reached out and transferred the whole
of the hot cakes to his own plate. Then
there was something doing.
Big Jem Blake, who was sitting fully
ten feet up the table from the uncon
scious cause .of the tension in. the air.
saw the transfer of the "bucks" and
acted forthwith. ' Rising from his
bench, he planted himself squarely on
his hands and knees in the middle of
the table and commenced a rapid pro
gress down the length of the cluttered
oilcloth. With knee in butter and coat
dragging coffee cups from their saucers.
Big Jem shuffled on down the table un
til he had reached the place where the
Italian sat open-mouthed in wonder
ment.
Without a word or a flickering of an
eyelid Big Jem reached out one brawny
paw and grasped the Italian by the
chin whiskers, giving them a downward
wrench which made the jaw creak.
With the other hand he gathered up
the pile of hot cakes and thrust the
whole, steaming, into the wide-open
mouth of the victim.
Then he crawled carefully back down
the length of tMe table and took hio
seat as if he were at a church service.
An Ancient Bell.
The oldest bell in the United States
is on exhibition in the New Mexico
building of the "World's Fair. ThÂ£ bell
was brought from Spain on one of thÂ«
first expeditions to Mexico by Father
Juan de Padilla, one of tne Franciscan
fathers who accompanied Coronado to
New Mexico. It was hung in one of
the mission churches established in one
of the seven cities of Cibola. From
there it was taken to Gran Quivera,
where it was hung in a church of
which the ruins are still visible. From
Gran Qnivera it was taken to Algo>
dones. where it has hung in the parish
church ever since. Father Padilla was
killed by his guides while on the way
from Gran Quivera to Algodones. The
bell weighs exactly 193 pounds. It was
baptized Maria Josefa. It was cast in
the year A. D. 1353, according to the
inscription which is cast in the bell.
The "F" in the word "Josefa" . is in
verted, and the" letters "S" and "E"
are transposed, the mistake evidently
haAng been made in the mold.

TO-MORROW The Sunday Call will publish the
first installment of "The Fugitive," a new novel
by Ezra ~S. Brudno, which, notwithstanding the
title, is /nowise sensational or melodramatic in either
plot or treatment. On the contrary, it is as simple, di
rect and sincere as are all the narratives of men who
have' suffered long and severely, and learned theovays
of the world through hard, bitter experience, and who,
therefore,~write of the things that they know, and not
merely the things they imagine.
Without doubt it is for this reason that "The Fugi
tive," which came fresh from the authbr to the pub
lishers only three months' ago, and which is said to be
a frank expose of the writer's own life, is already at
tracting wide and critical attention, not only in America
but in Europe as well. Indeed, notwithstanding it has
been so little advertised, the leading booksellers of San
Francisco in particular already declare it will be one
of the most popular novels of the year.^
In a new way it depicts the life of the Jews, both in
Russia and America, describing, not so much as may,
be supposed from the title of the book,- their fanatical
persecution under the rule of the Czar, or'^the merely
humorous feature of their life in the Ghetto of New
York, as their inner hopes and fears, their religion, their
family customs, their ambitions, the secret of tbeir law
of intermarriage and the causes that have led the race
to be the fugitive of the world wherever they may turn.
In tiiis sense it is a remarkable book, a truly powerful
series of word pictures that linger in the memory of
the reader long'after the. book itself has been put. aside.
Even to those who know the Czar's domains and the
social and political conditions more than'passing well
"The Fugitive" will be a revelation, while it departs>iar
from the popular traditions of the Ghetto in the final
scenes that are laid in^this seething section of^New
York. ' . r.
It will be published complete in five installments, and
in order to make its appearance all the more notable,
Mr. Bert, Levy, who is just arrived from Australia, has
been specially commissioned to remain in San Francisco
and illustrate it from beginning to end in his best style,
exclusively for The Sunday Call.
Mr." Levy, who is himself a Jew, is one of the best
known artists in the Antipodes. Thus under The Sun
day Call's liberal and progressive literary policy of giv
ing its readers the very . latest high-class literature by
the most notable authors in the world, tRere has been
secured not only the novel, of the hour by a writer of
unquestioned ability, but the > work of an able artist
from another far distant quarter of the globe, both
brought' together for ihc first time~1n one edition to
picture the sorrows and sufferings, the' ideals and the
history of their own race.
But apart from the first installment of "The Fugitive,"
The Sunday Call to-moorrovv will contain many other
interesting and important features, notably the first
photograph yet* presented of the men of the nations
whom the Mikado seeks to keep off the firing line; the
photograph's of the first Esquimaux school in the
shadow of the North* Pole; the "Arts and Crafts Move
ment in America," written by Gustav Stickley, editor
of "The Craftsman"; the. "Right and Wrong Time to
Punish Children," by William J. Shearer; "Our Dese
crated Flag," a most timely treatise, by Nellie Blessing
Eyster, illustrated with a striking picture of the new
Francis Scott Key monument; "The Child Model* of the
Studios," with a full page of photographs; the answers
to questions of "What Women Want to Know," by
Madge Moore; "Wagneristic Stage Manners," humor
ously dissected by Jerome K. Jerome ;,"Sankey's Double
Header," an exciting, half humorous, but- at times'wholly
pathetic railroad story, by Frank H. Spearman; "The
Second Violin," by Otto B. Senga; the new multiple
color music page; the full-page picture from life of
"Driving in the Park.'V-and many other articles which
space will not permit enumerating.
THE SUNDAY CALL,
Keen observers, of passing events have noted the' fact
that the closing- of the New York poolrooms has re
sulted in a tremendous increase in the attendance of
men and women at the racetrack. The outcome should
be accepted with complacency, as it greatly simplifies
the work of the police and' 'materially reduces the
ground of inquiry and search for merchants that hire
gambling clerks and bookkeepers. > ]
way development, of which the Te
huantepec is the latest phase. At the
beginning of the first term of President
Diaz, in 1S77, but one railwayâ the
Mexican: or Vera Cruz line, 2S3 miles
in lengthâ existed in the republic. In
1880 the two great systems of the Mexi
can National and Mexican Central
railroads were commenced. Railroads*
now traverse every State except Lower
California, Tabasco and Campeachy.
At present abÂ«ut 12,000 miles of rail
road, operated by ten companies, .are
in service. ft;";-.*'-
An equally remarkable feature has
been the solving of national financial
problems. When Diaz came IÂ»to power
the public debt amounted to above
$150,000,000, and the annual deficit in
national revenues was near $10,000,000.
In fourteen years the debt has been

Big Jem's Politeness.
Kaneko, Japan's Minister.
A man much in the public eye just
now is Baron Kentaro Kaneko, bacb>
elor of laws and doctor of laws t Har
vard University, member of the Jap
anese House of Peers, formerly Min
ister of State for Agriculture ( and
Commerce, one of the four authors of
the Japanese constitution arid special
envoy to America of the Japanese
Emperor. He has made many friends
end aroused much Interest "by his ad
dresses at Harvard, where he has .been
a guest of the Japan Club, and else
where and by his published articles on
Japan's law and constitution and oh
the war In the Far . East. The July
Ontury also announces an article
from his pen, "The Magna Charta of
Japan." .
Baron Kentaro Kaneko was born in
THE socialism of the world; as a cult is just now
directed from Italy. The Italian socialists* haye
been divided into two wings, led respectively by
Bissolati, the reformist or conservative, and by Labfi
61a, the revolutionist. The party has just held its
annual congress at Bologna, and after a â¢ serious clash
and heated discussion the revolutionists won. The re
formist programme, submitted by Bissolati, included
recognition of the existing institutions of government
and denunciation of the tyranny of capitalism, Jmt, also,
the proposition to support such measures of other par
ties in the government as would advance the socialist
ideas, such as government ownership of public utilities.
In opposition Labriola submitted this: "Reaffirming
the permanent and intransigent revolutionary character
of the party of the proletariat in opposition to the
bourgeois- state (the term borghesia now comprises all
classes outside the proletary), the congress declares
that the transformation of the political organization of
the proletariat into a parliamentary, opportunist, con
stitutional and possibly monarchial organization is a
degeneration of the socialistic spirit, inconsistent with
the spirit of class warfare, with the very essence of
the conquest by the proletaries of the government (pub
lici poteri). Hence it . repudiates collaboration with
any other classâ not only participation in any monarchi
cal government, but also systematic support of any
bourgeois government, whatsoever tendencies it may
evince, even if reforms proposed may be partially useful
.to the working classes." . '
It was explained that by "bourgeois state" is meant
such republican governments as France and the United
States. This programme had one-fourth more votes
than the other, thus reversing the conservative action
of the last congress at Imola. The socialists allÂ« over
the world hiive looked for inspiration to this Italian
congress, and its declaration of class? warfare will be
found the inspiring, force oj the'party in all countries.
It is explained that since the Imola congress 'the
revolutionists have gained strength by promoting labor
strikes and increasing friction with the employers of
labor, but that this bourse has had the effect of diminish
ing the sympathy for labor on the. part of those here
tofore friendly. But the revolutionists have been com
pensated for this loss of support of labor by the alle
giance of that very laboring class whose troubles have
been increased by their violence and recklessness. In
a highly classified society like that- of Italy, it might
be taken for granted that no further effort to stratify
society would be necessary. But the socialists seem to
realize that they require the elimination of all sympa
thy with the country and its institutions 'and of all sense
of community of interest with their fellow men who
do not see as they do. ,
It is evident that this revolutionary idea is the strong
est sentiment among socialists in this country, and that
they feel the same necessity for the isolation of a class
which they can lead as soon as it feels its complete
separation from the 'body of the community. This ex
plains the insidious development of class feeling here.
The American idea of long the motive of all our
people, was that we had no .distinct class among us.
Labor was held by allAmericans .to be dignified and
the first of man's natural rights. The broad opportunity,
open to all men, if rightly used, held open the door of
hope to every laborer, and the workingman of to-day
could by thrift, temperance and economy "become the
independent man of to-morrow. So, also, the capitalist
of to-day might in the mutations of fortune become the
workingman of to-morrow.
All observers appreciate the decline of that idea and
its substitution by a distinctly class spirit. Everything
tltat force and policy .can do is being done to inculcate
the socialist idea,. that a man must live and die in the
sta'tion in which he was born and that his hand from the
cradle to the grave must be against all other men than
his own class. So there has- grown up a system of
curbs upon individual ambition. The skillful man is
denied the benefit of his, skill and is taught that he must
keep step with the lame and the lazy and unskillful in
his craft, whatever it may be. 'We suppose that the
leaders of this class theory, who compel these condi
tions and force this leveling process. ; would deny, 'and
perhaps sincerely, that the;- arc ?'â¢ .instruments of
socialism. "But the drop of water that runs hill,
and not up, might as well deny that it is subject to the
law of gravity.
The bold emergence of the Italian socialists into the
revolutionary stage is an indication that they have com
pleted the process of class isolation. Hereafter, they
will rapidly assimilate the revolutionary element of the
anarchists and communists, and in due time the socialist
movement everywhere will follow their lead. Unless
their instruments in this country cease in promoting that
class organization, which already assumes to divide the
country into laborers and capitalists, we will be in the
midst of a revoh'tion that will appear out of a
clear sky.
The Italian socialists see in the French republic and
in the United States government by the great mass of
people who are classed neither. -as laborers nor capi
talists. These are the independent,, home-owning peo
ple, who work, for themselves and reject dictation by
the leaders of-a class or organization. In this* country
there appears a set purpose to deplete that -force by
denying to men the right to become independent by. the
fruits of their labor and the use of their skill. If they
will" not submit tq classification and to the dictation of
organization they; are practically outlawed and forbidden
the right to live at all. Therefore, it is that the mass
to which such men naturally belong, the. mass called the
bourgeois in France and the borghesia in Italy, should
immediately address ? itself ' to^ tbc assertion of their
rights if it would avert "the pending revolution.

oi him is due to lack of anything in him that may be
justly criticized at all. His^ncmies manufacture a. set
ot characteristics for him and call the country to listen
to what they have to say about it.
In the midst of the saying the President shows plainly

ascribed to him and then a new set has to be -manu

to admit the affidavit -without protest
he had supposed it was Mr. Fay's, but
upon examination he found an unveri
fied statement from C. E. Grunsky In
corporated and he did object to that.
Mr. Partridge replied that the bill con
tained general allegations. Gruncky
appraised the property of the company
and that would have bearing on the
allegations. In the company's com
plaint the statement of George ,E.
Hooker, 'chief clerk of the company,
was opinion evidence. In this Instance
the evidence of Grunsky, who was an
officer of the Board of Supervisors, was
official and is a matter of record. Judge
Gilbert asked If the record was included
in the affidavit. Before Mr. Partridge
could reply, Mr.' Kellogg argued to the
court that the city could not Introduce
an unverified statement and that of
j Mr. Grunsky was unverified. This
! statement contained the very bone of
i contention and he asked that' it be not
admitted. , â¢
Mr. Partridge said it was introduced
in order to show that the Board of

Matters that involve a large sum in
dispute between the people of San
Francisco and the Spring Valley Water
Company are under consideration be
fore Judge Gilbert of the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals. The com
pany asks the court to grant an in
junction restraining the city and county
of San Francisco from putting into
effect the rates for water rents fixed by
the Board of Supervisors for the fiscal
> ear beginning July 1, 1004, and ending
June 20, 1905.
The Spring Valley Company is rep
i<?sented in court by M. B. Kellogg. Its
regular representative, and the city by
City Attorney Percy V. Long and his
essistant, John S. Partridge. Facts
which %o to show that the rates levied
by the board were arbitrary were.pre
sented by Mr. Kellogg in the complaint
x:pon which the application is based,
end also by" affidavits of witnesses rec
ognized as competent to give testimony
in questions pertaining to the matters
Â£t Issue.
The complaint sets forth the fact that
the company requests aa interlocutory'
injunction 'atrxÂ»inst the city and county
of Ean Francisco, the Board of Super
visors and all the members thereof to
reetrain them from putting into effect
the water rates fixed for the year. The
Supervisors have cut off the revenue
to which the company claims it is en
titled. That is based on a cut of 7 per
cent on all service excepting hydrants,
where the cut has been 50 per cent.
MILLIONS EXPENDED.
There had been between $28,000,000
end $29,000,000 expended by the com
pany known as the Spring Valley \Va'
ter Works up to September, 1203, at
Â¦ hich time the company was reorgan
ized under the present name of the
Spring Valley Water Company and the
capital stock doubled. The old com
pany had a capital of $14,000,000,'mit the
new company has a capitalization of
S2*-000,000. All of the indebtedness of
the "works'' was absorbed by the
"company." The doubling of the cap
ital is based on the appraisement of the
present holdings of the company.
The company contends it has prop
erty to the value of $53,047,700, while
the Board of Supervisors, in the name
Â«'f the city and county, claims the value
will not exceed $25,528,420.
Operating expenses this year will be
$560,000. La^t year they were $546,000.
In explaining that matter to the court
Mr. Kellog-g: stated estimates of the rev
enue had been omitted from the ordi
nance. Hence the company contended
the cit5 r law was fatally defective and
void. Last year the~taxes of the com
pany were $449,000, while this year,
based on the estimates made by the
Board' of Supervisors, they would be
5025,27S. Since 1S99 the company claims
there has been expended in actual cash
$7,500,000.
CLERKS REPORT.
Two affidavits, signed Dy George E.
Hooker, chief clerk or tne company,
were presented. Mr. Hooker has been
connected with the compart for thirty
years. His first affidavit gave the num
ber of rate payers doing business with
the company and the usual cost for
service rendered. His second docu
ment exhauÂ£ted the subject of earnings
and possible profits. His ceduction of
result* was to the effect that the com
pany would have an Income equivalent
to 1.18 per cent on the $55,000,000 in
vested if the rates established by the
Board of Supervisors prevails.
H. Schussler, who has been chief en
gineer for the company curing thirty
seven years, was quoted In an affidavit
as placing the value of the company's
property at $53,047,700, of which amount
$6,000,000 is in real estate.
Assistant City Attorney Partridge
opened the side of the case for the city
and county by reading the answer to
the complaint- That document is a
general denial of the conditions alleged
in the complaint and started out with
the proposition that no business man in
the city knew the expenses or receipts
of the company. Efforts had been made
to get the facts from the company, but
it had been impossible. Denial was
made to the statement that the com
pany has any water rights in Alameda
County for the purpose of furnishing
water to San Francisco. The claim
was advanced that the company was
trying to Khut out all competition.
Pvesprvoirs had been constructed at too
much expanse, Â¦ but even then they
would not supply 2.000.000 Inhabitants
fcs the company claimed.
In fixing the rates the Bosrd, of
Supervisors had taken in excess of $24.
000,000 as the value of tne property.
The claims of the company that it was
through Its service that Insurance rates
had been lowered was denied and the
fact advanced that it was due to the
removal of wooden buildings and the
recognized ability of the San Fran
cisco Fire Department.
DATA FURXLSHEI).
In order to establish the fact that
sufficient data had been In possession
of the Board of Supervisors at the time
the consideration of fixing the rate was
up, an exhaustive affidavit, signed by
Charles W. Fay, clerk of the Board of
Supervisors, was read. Mr. Kellogg

My Dear Sir:
A meeting of the Democratic State Central

Saturday, June 18, 11HM. at 1 o'clock p. m..

the transaction of such other business aa may
rcgularlr come before said meeting.
The prospects of Democratic success In the
'coming campaign are indeed bright, and the
interest manifested at our recent State Con
vention evidences a desire on the part of the
Democracy of California to wage an active,
energetic and successful campaign in our State
By thus organizing our forces early we will
be .prepared Immediately upon the nomination
of our standard bearer at St. Louis to com
mence an organized canvass In his behalf and
devoti our beat energies toward securing the

It is desirable that a full attendance of the
committee be had, and you are respectfully
urged -to make it a points to be personally
present at the meeting- Very truly yours
B. D. MURPHY, Chairman.
A. McCABE. Secretary.
There was some talk yesterday that
Frank H. Gould wouldl not announce
the appointment of the. executive com
mittee of twenty-five authorized by the
recent Santa. Cruz convention until
affer the adjournment of the National
Convention at. St. Louis, but In view
of the action of Barney Murphy in
calling for organization of the State
committee on the 18th inst., Mr. Gould
may conclude to do something right
away. Some crafty moves on the
Democratic chess board may be ex
pected.
The proposed banquet to A. Ruef by
his "friends and sympathizers promises
to take on the character of a local
demonstration. Fire Commissioner
George Boyne and others who are man
aging the function have now ascer
tained that the Mechanics' Pavilion
must be engaged in order to find space
to accommodate all who are signifying
a desire to attend the dinner. At first
It was surmised that the maple room
of the Palace would be large enough,
but later on it was suggested to take
Native Sona'.or Golden Gate hall, but
the .advance call for tickets convinced
the managers that neither hall would
hold the throng. Tickets , to* the ban
quet'may be procured at. No. 16 Geary
street to-day, between' the hours of 4
and 5 o'clock p. m. and after 8 p. m.
The dinner will take place the even

Andrew Tripp, saloon-keeper at
Kearny and Washington streets, mod
estly disclaimed desire to pose as a
critic of stage offerings, nor did he
wish to - appear In the light of one
afflicted with theaterphobla. At the
same tinÂ»e, however, he believed ex
perience had qualified him to discrim
inate between the worthy and the un
worthy In the matter of public amuse
mvits, and he certainly did look upon
the Star Music Hall as an inferior ea-
tablishment of its class. - *
The Star Music Hall occupies the
basement of the building in which Mr.
Tripp dispenses wet goods on the first
l'.oor, and. it was for destroying a sign
board and some electric light fixtures,
the property of the theater, that Mr.
Tripp was a defendant in the court
c-f Judge Mogan.
"Without questioning your insinua
tion that the stage of the Star could
be improved by moral elevation," said
the court to Mr. Tripp, "I must re
mind you that we are not here to dis
cuss the quality of the show, but to
ascertain whether you are guilty or
not guilty of malicious mischief. Now
go ahead with your explanation."
Mr. Tripp did not deny that he
smashed the signboard, also the elec
tric lights. Xo, it was not solely because
the entertainment produced In the cel
lar displeased him that he committed
the misdemeanor. Yes, he would ac
knowledge that his inspiration was
mercenary. The fact was that the
Star's signboards and electric light* at
tracted people to the cellar who might
have dropped into his place of business
if no such allurement existed. But he
would like to have it understood that
he had entered \>ral protest against the
placards and the Illumination before
he demolished them. His objections
were ignored by the management of
the cellar, one Harry Monroe, so there
was nothing left for him to do other
than what he did.
After the Judge had reminded Mr.
Tripp that formal complaint of. a nui
sance might have resulted in compul
sory removal of the obnoxious adver
tisements he pronounced Mr. Tripp
guilty as charged and ordered him to
appear for sentence next Monday.
The smashed signboard was not pre
sented as an exhibit in the case, but
persons who had seen It were ready
to testify that there was nothing in the
information it imparted that .would of
fend the most fastidious taste. True,
its legends savored of hyperbole, but
in theater advertising that quality is
inevitable and popularly accepted as
legitimate. It heralded the appearance
of several performers who were de
scribed as "world famous" and "im
mense favorites," although their names
were comparatively unmown in the
atrical lore. In all other respects that
signboard was as .. artistic as they
make 'em; Â¦ " "~* - ..
"Can't you make it Tuesday Instead
of Monday?" inquired Nathan Cohn,
known on the water front as "Doma
doma," when Judge Mogan had or
dered him to appear on the latter day
for sentence.
"Why do you object to Monday?" his
Honor asked.
"Because Monday is the 13th, and
I'm superstitious," replied Mr. Cohn. . .
"But I'm not the least bit superstiy'
tious," said the Judge, "and you'll get
no larger a dose on Monday than I
would give you on Tuesday."
Mr. Cohn battered a peanut

S. P. Wentzel, whose theater of lar
cenous operations was the Hotel

charges of petty larceny and was sen
tenced to sixty days by Judge Ca

burglary against Mr. Wentzel and
they will be taken up from time to

other business.
Some audacious thief stole Clerk
Barney Conlan's hat from his desk
while the Wentzel case was engaging
his attention and for several hours
he was unable to get another chapeau.
There were plenty of spare hats in the
Hall of Justice, but in some mysteri
ous way they disappeared as soon as
Mr. Conlan's loss 'became known, and
as neither love nor' money could In
duce any one to go out and buy him
a new head covering, he missed his
luncheon and might have gone din
nerless also if Judge Cabaniss had not
suddenly remembered the whereabouts
of a hat which ' he shelved in the
spring of 1901.
Mr. Conlan desired to have It an
nounced that if the person who took
the hat would report to him there will
be no effort on his part to recover It.
Alvin Anderson took a friend to

"Strawberry Charlie."
Judge Mogan dismissed the com
plaint of battery which 14-year-old
Leslie Herbert of 1473 Oak street had
filed against Morton L. Cook, the ad
vertising agent. The testimony went
to show that the defendant's son and
Dr. Chalmers' son had been "scrap

Eides against the Cook boy and was
abusing him when the' defendant com
mitted the alleged battery. The Judge
opined that the Herbert boy inter

under false pretenses by .representing
that he owned the schooner Clara Kim

"I don't want no lawyer," said Fred
Moller, charged with stealing one cop
per boiler from Mrs. McCollom of) 615

"But I Insist that you shall have a
lawyer," said Judge Mogan, "because
you seem to underestimate the serious
ness of your position. Are you aware
that conviction may result in your be
ing sent to the penitentiary?;'
Mr. Moller evidently had not looked
at the matter in that light, and he of
fered no objection when the court ap
pointed an attorney to conduct his de
fense. ,
Various housewives told Judge Mogan
of how they had been taken In and
done for by Harry Singer, charged with
grand larceny by three different com
plainants. It was Mr. Singer's wont,
the ladies said, to- obtain entrance to
dwellings by representing that he was
taking subscriptions for a ladies' maga
zine and desired to exhibit some sam
ple copies. Once inside he would ask
for a drink of water, and while the
housekeeper was absent procuring the
aqua he would slip into his pocket such
portable property as could conveniently
be concealed. The case was continued.

It was in the Flood building (hat
James Duffy disturbed the peace, and
when Judge Fritz asked him what he
meant by doing it he treated the matter
lightly.
"This detention," he said, "is very
annoying. I'm due at Palo Alto to col
lect some money this afternoon, and the
next train leaves In about fifteen min
utes. I'll barely have time to catch It"
"Got your , ticket, Mr. Duffy?" his
Honor Inquired, with seeming solicitude.
"Oh yes."
"Well, you'd better arrange to get a
stop-over privilege till next Wednes
day, for I must send you to Jail for five
days."
"Dear, dear; how exasperating!" ex
claimed Mr. Duffy as he rejoined the
excluded set.
Mary Wilson was almost overcome
by surprise when Judge Mogan told
her that she must remain in custody
until the charge of vagrancy against
her is decided one way or another. She
was arrested about two weeks ago and
the case was continued till last Satur
day, but on that date she failed to ap
pear and a bench warrant was Issued.
"Why, you had me here once, didn't
you?" she said to- the court. "What in
the world do you want me here again
for?" "/>Â¦'-
"Sorry to bring you from the Barbary
Coaet to this noxious atmosphere," was
his Honor's answer, "but you see,
Mary, the law, which ignores social dis
tinction, says that when you are or

"Mer-cy! Is that so?"
"Aye, 'tis so. And now to save you

During Its recent visit to San Fran
cisco the Santa Clara team played
three matches, losing to the San Fran
cisco County eleven on me first day,
losing to the Pacific eleven on the sec
ond day and beating the Alameda rep
resentatives on the, third. The Pacific
eleven won an easy victory, scoring 241
runs for three wickets and getting the
Santa Cruz men out for the small total
of 47. A. W. Wilding was in excellent
batting form, scoring 107 runs not out
for the Pacific feam. This Is the sec

shown better form at the club courts
than in this match.
During the last week MacGavin has
been taking advantage of every oppor
tunity for practice, in order that next
week's 'match may not find him in the
same form as last week.
As Is usual before the State cham
pionship tournament, both the Califor
nia and the Golden Gate clubs will sus
pend all tournaments for the next three
weeks. This will give the cracks alt
the time necessary for practice and the
delay in tournament play will serve to
renew Interest in the big event.
The State "championship does not
look promising this year. But few
players have signified their intention
of participating. Many of the cracks
do not look favorably upon San Rafael
for the meet on account of the hot
weather, while others contend they will
not be able to spare the three or four
days necessary for the competition. At
any rate there will bejpany of the reg
ulars on hand an I some high-class play
will be seen.
It may be that the winner of this
tournament will take the championship
without figuring in a challenge match.
Grant Smith, the present champion!
has not yet made up his mind whether
or not he will defend his title. Ho
vows, however, that he vlll not play if
the weather is as hot as It has b** tl
for the past two years at San Rafael
on July 4. ...

When this tournament was started
there was no official list upon which
entries should be' posted, "instead
each of the ninety T two club members
was entered v and Gartners were then
drawn. This proved a wise plan, for
it brought many into the competition
who would not have entered their
names. There were comparatively few
defaults in the preliminary round and
these, as a rule, were due to the con
testants being out of town. The tour
nament committee expects to com
plete the first round without .a single
default,- as those remaining in the
tournament are among the regulars
who are out each week. The players
will meet in the first round as follows:

Applications for membership in the

The members of the San , Franciscp
Model Yacht Club took a day off last
Sunday, no official club races being
held. Several of the fast models were
out and a number of unoificial races
were sailed during the day. Honors
were about equally divided between the
Fannie, Surprise, Apache and Imp. It
is the* intention of the committee to
hold one of the.regular official pennant
races to-morrdTv, when the fast yachts
in the club will be on hand to compete.
Within the last f ew "â¢ weeks many
models have been bailt and most of
them by enthusiasts, who are not mem

Club. The* public is beginning to real*

At 4 p. m. the painter of thi yawl.
which was being towed, parted and
considerable work was necessary to
pick ua the little craft. At 8 p. m.
Santa Barbara light was almost abeam,
the absence of -wind and a heavy swell
causing the main boom to slap to and
fro violently. At 8:'" p. m. a light
breeze, sprang up, which soon fresh
ened, and at 4:30 a. m. on Wednesday
the Santa Barbara light was out of
view. At 5 a. m. Point Hueneme was

The annual class flag regatta and
race for the Owners' Cup of the Cali
fornia Yacht Club takes place on the
Jfnh inst. Owing to the removal of
}?lossom Rock buoy, which was one of
the marks in the races of the California
Yacht Club, the course will be changed.
The Owners' Cup race will take place
nt the same time and over the same
course as the regatta for class flags,
but will be a handicap event, the al
lowances being fixed by the regatta
committee. All the yachts enrolled in
the club will be considered as entered

off Hurricane Gulch the yacht received
a hard knockdown, and off Yellow

top to bottom in two places and ripped
away from the leach. The torn sail
vas taken aboard and the yacht put
about for her moorings off Sausalito,
which she made at 4:20 p. m., under
tow of a revenue cutter's launch. Sails
Â¦were secured at the club house, l>ne

es a Jib. At 12:15 on Sunday morning,
vith a reef in her mainsail, the yacht
sot under way with a moderate north
west wind. Point Bonita was breasted

southwest wind. Short tacks were
made off shore^ Pc-int San Pedro was
abeam at 7 a. m. and Montara Light
Â«t 8:20 a. m. Long legs were made down
the coast, with short hitches off shore,
till 6:39 p. m. on Sunday.
With Pigeon Point distant southeast
about four miles, sheets were eased and
a course south by east set. the wind
being light. Pigeim Point light was
abreast of the uort beam at 8:25 p. m.,
the point Ijeing about two miles dis
tant and the course southeast by south,
with light wind, smooth sea, warm and
cloudy weather. Pigeon Point light was
lost at 1:30 a. m. on Monday and Point
Pinos light was off the port beam at
3 a. m.. the log recording nineteen and
a quarter miles finee passing Pigeon
Point light. The wind was light from
the northwest, but soon freshened con-
Fidfrably. A large steamer was passed
and at 5 a. m._a school of whales was
s-i silted.
At about 8 o'clock, near the end of
Rridginan and Morrison's watch, the
wheel became useless, the head of the
rudder stock having twisted off. A
jury steering gear was fitted and
trotted admirably for the rest of the
trip. Cape San Martin was passed and
at S p. "m. Point Piedras Blancas light
vas abreast, bearing east-northeast,
distant about eight miles. Sky clear, a
strong, steady breeze and a heavy sea.
At midnight the wind moderated and.

The annual championship rowing
regatta will be held under the man
agement of the Pacific Athletic Asso
ciation on Lake Merritt, Oakland, on
July 4. The races will begin about
2 p. m., the intervals between them
being taken up by a life-saving exhi
bition by the aid of kites by Dr. F. W.
Riehl and other performances. It is
hoped that Dr. August Greth will give
a demonstration with his airship. The
Alameda Boating Club will be repre
sented in the senior and junior four
oared barge races. Three Junior
crews are practicing on Oakland
Creek for the barge race in that class.
It is doubtful whether enough inter
mediate crews will enter to fill that
class.
On the 19th inst. the Dolphin Club
will hold a try-out to decide who
shall represent it In the annual cham
pionship. regatta on Lake Merrltt on
July 4. Those who will take part in
the try-out are Leo D. Weinand,
Frank Curry. Steve Vlcini, F. J. Sher
ry and W. O. Patch.
The crew that will wear the colors
of the Dolphin Boating Club in the
annual championship race in the in
termediate-four-oared barge class will
be made up of A. Bertrand, Ernest
Schuppert, T. Harris and W. Harris,
with T. Richmond as cockswain. The
crew will use the new racing barge
which is being built by T. R. Keenan.
It is expected to prove one of the
lightest and fastest boats of her class
on the bay. â¢ -
Barge crews from the South End,
Ariel and Dolphin rowing clubs will
take part to-morrow in a race at El
Campo, where the annual picnic of
the Celtic Union will be held. The*

The crew has been practicing and ex

Itself.
There will be but little action In the
way of tournament play on the tennis
courts for the next tnree weeks. The
only tournament match to be decided
before the State championship meet In
July will be the postponed challenge
match for the San Francisco champion
ship, between J. Drummond MacGavin
and Percy Murdock.
, This was to have taken place last
Sunday, but Murdock was ill and a
postponement was necessary. Play will
be called one week from to-morrow
afternoon at 2:30 on the California
Club courts. The match will consist of
the best three out of five sets. Mur
dock has . entirely recovered from his
illness and will be in first-class shape
for the match by that time.
It was, possibly, fortunate for Cham
pion MacGavin that the match was not
called last week, as he had one of his
off days and was in poor form. Frank
Mitchell, whom MacGavin should de
feat rather easily under ordinary cir
cumstances, took five straight sets
from the champion. Two of these by
scores of 6-1. It may be said for
Mitchell, however, that he has never

The coursing talent finds it difficult
to pick a winner in to-morrow's cham
pion stake at Union Park. Richard
Anton Is considered the fastest, but
lacks the drive necessary to win in
such company. Pocatelli had an oft
day last week, but this was only tem
porary- Rector has always been hard
to beat In a three-course stake. Belie
Free and Palo Alto had rather severe
running last week. McVey may prove
the surprise of the stake, as he Is a
fast greyhound.
In the open stake the best eight
seem to be Bright Fortune. Sacramen
to Boy, J. E H. Red Rock, Hudson.
Lucy Clait Raby Amora and Fonte
noy. The likely winners:
Champion stake â Rector, Palo Alto. Rich
ard Anton. McVey.
P. F. Callan has purchased Rose of
Gold, which many consider the most
promising puppy shown this year. It
was runner-up for the stake on New
Year's day.
H. M. N. Spring of San Jose has
registered his Futurity candidate. For
tunate Dawn, by Fortuna Favente-
Dawn, and thinks it the best grey
hound he has ever raised. As the
great Dawn came from his kennels his
present possession must have shown
him something out of the ordinary to
merit the praise of its owner. Mr.
Spring has also registered The Rival
and St. Luton.
James Sweeney also has great ex
pectations of three puppies from the
same litter. He has registered them
under the names of Sherman, Syntax
and Story's Sister.
The young greyhounds coming up
to take the places of the coursers
which have held the center of the
stage for some time are pronounce t
a promising collection. They are br-<i
to run and have been reared care
fully.

Ben was adjudged guilty of the crime
.it passed off as a good Joke, for Ben
is the favorite dog of the boiler-maker.
But woe to any other unfortunate
canine had he committed the deed. A
board and a brief inscription would
now mark his resting place.
Yesterday Jeff was feeling only or
dinarily good, but boxed eight fast
and hard rounds with his sparring
mates, Jack Jeffries and Joe Kennedy.
'It was about the sharpest clash of
arms* the trio has indulged in, and at
the close Kennedy was. bleeding from
the nose and the champion had a
slightly swollen lip. Long experience
has taught Jack Jeffries that discretion
is the' better part of valor," and Jack
always endeavors to be backing away
when his giant brother launches a
projectile. 'Kennedy, though, when
hurt is inclined to force things a bit,
and often falls heir to a hard rap. It
is always followed by an apology from
Jeff, who says: "I didn't hit you hard,
did I?" Kennedy is game, and always
passes back the buck with a "Nope."
Rope skipping, 'the pulleys and a short
spell of tugging with the sand bag
terminated the day's work. As before
mentioned, the boiler-maker was not
feeling especially spry, and there was
nothing doinsr in the afternoon.

OVERALL IN WINNING FORM.
This \ morning the champion was
limping around like a race horse with
a quarter crack and the warriors of
the Jeffries camp will unquestionably
rest on their arms to-day while the
chieftain's leg is - being attended to.
There is a swelling nearly the size of
a baseball on the left Knee cap and
what caused it is a mystery. The big
fellow says the pain kept him awake
from about 1 o'clock in the morning
and cold applications were tried to re
duce the 'unwelcome visitor. At first
it was thought the bite of some poi
sonous Insect may have caused it, .but
no such signs could be detected. Jeff
himself is inclined to ascribe it to the
result of an old Injury he received
while skylarking on the night of his
contest with James J. Corbett. While
alighting from a street car Cal Ewing,
the Oakland baseball magnate, jumped
on the champion's back and a mis
step caused the knee to be wrenched. .
Misfortunes do not come singly, for
Jeff and his. next door neighbors were
cheated out of a before Bedtime lunch
eon by old Ben, one of Proprietor Jim
Hayes' deer hounds.
On the menu for dinner yesterday
was roast pig, and the head of a sweet
suckling had been saved from the
wreckage for Jeff. It was taken to his
room for safe keeping, as abnormal ap
petites develop in a day here. At the
appointed time the ( champion . and a
few invited guests retired for the feast,
ludge of Â¦ their surprise on beholding
only, an eyeball and an ear remaining
of the toothsome delicacy. When old
He is suffering from what medical
men call synovial bursae, but which is
more commonly called "housemaid's
knee." There is a gathering of water
outside the left knee cap which has
formed a big sack. This is usually a
stubborn ailment, which is slow to yield
to treatment. Rest is the special treat
ment in these cases, and a month is
usually required before beneficial re
sults are obtained. Sometimes the knee
joint is badly involved, and then re
covery is a slow process.
The outward signs of trouble usually
develop some time after the knee has
been Injured. This Is often the case
with housemaids, who injure the deli
cate mechanism of the knee while
washing floors.
Dr. Devening, the physician at the
springs, cannot tell at present how
long Jeffries must rest. Owing to his
excellent condition nature may effect a
rapid cure. It is agreed by Manager
Delaney and by his assistants that a
let up of two days in Jeff's training
will do him no harm, as he has been
working exceptionally hard for some
days. A council of war will be held on
Monday, when a decision will be
reached as to whether Jeffries will go
on with the flght or whether he will
ask for a postponement.
HARBIN SPRINGS, June 10.â Just
when Champion Jeffries was congratu
lating himself that he had gone
through a severe course of training
without a single setback an injury was
developing which may necessitate a
postponement of his fight with Jack
Munroe.
Special Dispatch to The Call
By F. M >lul hoi I a ml.
Munroe intends to get rid of his staff
of heavies with the exception of Andy
Gallagher and gather a collection of
fast lightweights and welter-weights
who can step lively. He expects to de
velop footwork in this way. He will
also cut cut his long swims, contenting
himself with one plunge a day.
The sale of seats for the bis fight
opened yesterday morning at Harry
Corbett's and a large number were dis
posed of. From present indications ' It
seems the attendance wil) be large.
The latter talked with Billy Delaney,
at Harbin, over the telephone last
night. It developed that the symptoms
described by Delaney are Identical with
some shown by Jim Corbett when he
was training. They came from over
exertion and, in Corbett's case, a day's
rest always effected a cure. It is ex
pected a rest of twenty-four hours will
work wonders with Jeffries. Delaney
was positive that Jeffries will be ready
to defend his title next Friday night
and that no postponement will be
necessary. *&&%
Manager Pollock took a decided stand
in the matter of Eddie Graney referee
ing the light. "Leaving out all con
sideration of the Britt-Corbett flght."
he said, "I don't want Graney to referee
this flght, as 1 do not think him com
petent. I was told, on my way West,
that I will be forced to accept him.
I suppose if it came to a severe case I
might do so, but it would be under pro
test. 1 don't think Graney or any man
would want to act under such condi
tions.
"Regarding our standing with Jimmy
BrHt, we have an agreement to meet
on September 15 to arrange the details
of a match. In our agreement there Is

Jack Munroe worked a whole hour
yesterday afternoon without taking a
minute's rest with the exception of the
time consumed in changing his boxing
gloves. He went through his regular
stunts with the gloves, on the punch
ing bags and with the various maehiiy.*
around the gym. He finished up look
ing 'bigger and stronger than ever be
fore, and was not in the least fatigued
from hla hard work.
He went two fast rounds at lnflghtins
with Andy Gallagher as a wind-up for
the afternoon's labors. He bustled tha
clever amateur about the ring and
rushed him into corners, landing hard
rights and lefts whenever there was
rxn opening. He caught Andy one good
hard right on the jaw during a clinch
and it shook him up. Before donning
the mitts with Gallagher the bJg minÂ«r
tcok on Owen Sullivan and Frank Ra
fael. He used Sullivan rather harshly
at times and assumed the clever pose
with Rafael.
Harry Pollock, manager for Jack
Munroe, arrived last night from the
East. He was disappointed at hearing
of Jeffries' trouble, but his fears were
dispelled after a conversation with
Harry Corbett. Â» â¢

Joe Thomas^ stowed Bonar Wilt
away in the fourth round of a slow,
tedious flght at Mechanics' Pavilion
Annex last night. The finishing punch
was a hard right to the jaw. Wilt
was not entirely out, but his seconds
threw up the sponge to save their
man from further punishment at the
hands of his husky young opponent.
The flght was the main event of the
Lincoln Club's card.
The other bouts were remarkable
for the bad decisions made by Referee
Milton Hayes. A game lad styled
"Young Choynski" was pitted against
Charles Augustus and succeeded in
half murdering the latter. The Judges
disagreed and the referee showed
enough bad judgment to give the flght
to the beaten man. Again, in the go
between Qeorgie Currie and Billy
Condon, the old-time heavy-weight,
bad judgment prevailed, for Condon
got the palm of victory, although the
best he did was to' hold on every time
his opponent came rushing at him.
Currie landed all the punches and
forced the milling from the tap of the
gong. â¢Â¦
Willie Friel easily outpointed Jack
Bradshaw in a fast four-round mix
up, in which both boys were badly
punished. Sam Anderson knocked out
Jack Jackson in one round and Ed
Mensor got a hair-line decision over

RUNS AND HITS BY INNINGS.
tossers. played some good
baseball at Recreation Park yesterday,
and the Oakland crowd didr otherwise.
At least they did toward the end of the
game, for in the eighth, round every
man on the team seemed to soar heav
enward. They, stayed there until three
runs came In and completely splintered
the game.' Score,' San Francisco 6, Oak
land 1.
Oakland could not hit Whalen. They
managed to coax in - a run during the
progress of. the second Inning, , when
Dunleavy was given ,a- life .on a bad
throw by Reitz, stole, and arrived on a
hit by Brick Devereaux. .San Fran
cisco was not long in coming back, for
in the next period, with two gone, HJ1
debrand singled , and 'arrived on Wal
dron's double to left.
San Francisco got another start in
the fourth. Irwin clouted one past
Francks. Townsend ,. ,. sacrificed and
Reitz came through wjth a smash out
to left. Moskiman made a bad throw
to-.the plate and Irwin was allowed to
come in instead of being caught ten
filet from the pan.
. Nothing; happened then till the sev
enth. Then Hildebrano swatted out a
double to center and TValdron hit one
to Cooper that was too torrid to handle.
Hildebrand played off third and Cooper
â¢threw to catch him. Devereaux dropped
the ball, and that's the story of the
third run.
It was broken up for a fare-ye-well
in round eight. Irwin again hit the
leather safely and Townsend produced
another sacrifice. SchlaHey dropped
Reitz's fly and Ganley dropped Leahy's
long one. This meant another tally,
and two more followed when Whalen
flew to left and Miller hit over short.

wajj beaten again to-day, and this
latest defeat seems to wipe out entirely
any hope his owners may have enter
tained of his winning: the Suburban
against such thoroughbreds as Irish
Lad and The Picket. He certainly
would have no chance under such a
listless ride as Bullman gave him to
day. Africander needs strong, vigorous
riding.
Audience, winner of the race in which
Africander met defeat. Is a slashing
good daughter of Sir Dixon and out of
that great race mare Sallie McClelland.
Audience improves with every ra/:e. She
has not only sr>eed, but she has more
courage and stamina than many colts
in the three-year-old division. Great as
is Newton Bennington's Beldame, there
are many who will pin their faith to
the daughter of Sir Dixon when they
meet, especially if the race is over a
distance of ground.
In to-days race Garnish, a selling
plater, which was a 40 to 1 chance in
the betting, sailed away in front with
surprising speed and was soon running
ten lengths in front of the field. Then
he gradually slowed up. but it was not
until the last jump that Audience man
aged to poke her nose in front. Sum

TO OPEN CAN FROM SIDE. Remove label from can. Force point into exact center of top. Bend <

seam, with lever perpendicular. Press down on lever, which will force side blade into can. Hold can tiffhtlv ,
by top with other hand and cut same as when cutting top. In cutting top off always let bottom of bar rest ;
and run evenly around edge of can to insure even, regular cut. If the side blade comes out while cutting, or ;
cuts in too far and stops, it is because you have not inserted point of bar in exact center of can. In this case <
throw up lever, readjust blade and continue cutting until blade reaches opposite side of seam, when top can ,

Three suits were filed in the Superior
Court yesterday by persons who want
payment for personal injuries received
while they were passengers on the cars
of the United Railroads of San Fran
cisco. Joseph R. Costa asks for $10,000
as the price of two fingers amputated
as the result of injuries alleged to have
been sustained in an accident on the
Guerrero-street line on April .19 last,
when the car Is said to have collided
with a wagon of the Morrison Lumber
Company. The lumber company Is
made a codefendant. John A. Steele,
as guardian of Rita May Steele, a
minor, sues the railroad company for
$10,000 because a Mission-street car, as
alleged, ran into her on August 21, 1903.
She is said to have been sick for four
weeks as a result of the injuries. Wil
liam M. Tietjen and his wife, Annie,
demand $5000 for alleged injuries re
ceived on October 30, 1903, when a car
Is alleged to have collided with Michael
W. Coffey's hack in which Mrs. Tietjen
was riding.' Coffey Is a codefendant.

NEW TORK, June IB.â Prices of etocks
moved upward to-day rather more decidedly
and comprehensively than in any of the move
ments th&t hare developed during' the week.
The movement *aÂ» rather obvlouely In pro
fessional hand*, but thÂ« operations" of the
day were of a. volume and of a concerted
chararter, which made an lmx>ression that
they were in pkllled hands s.t.4 barked by re
rourcee that promised greater effects than the
tentative and timid operations to which the
recent market has befrn restricted. The mar
ket movement seemed to be the r>sÂ«ilt of crys
tallized wertSment which has been forming for
uevcra! days of a more cheerful kind over the
general bu*ine*s outlook. The greater breadth
and etrenirth of the^movement was effective in
<Jrlvlnir in some ehorts who have not Wen Im
pressed with the smaller movements and their
buying to Â«>rer was a factor In extending the
advance. It vu the common opinion that (he.
buylnc Â«m hawd larrely on the expectation
of a ravomble report by the Acricultural De

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Receipts of Butter yesterday were the heavl- ;
eÂ«t thin season,, as will be seen, and In fact
were about as heavy as ever known In thU
market. They produced no visible effect on the
situation, however, and the market continued 1
quiet and featureless. Cheese was also un- !
chnnged. . . 1
Eggs were weak and. while there was no I
actual decline, most dealers were shading the
quotations. There wers Â¦ quite a number of
I sales of fine ranch at 21iÂ£22c by houses which ,
I eold! at 22ifJ23o the preceding day. The demand 1
was also lighter and the market was dragging 1 i
1 and weak at the close.

j Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Stocks of all kinds of fruits were well up to
requirements and the market nad an easy tone,
as local trading was quiet and there was very
little doing in the shipping line. Receipts of
black Cherries were lighter than usual and
good sound offerings cleaned up readily at
steay prices, but there was tne usual pressure
to sell soft and overripe stock. Loose Royal

CHICAGO, June 10. â Unofficial forecasts
that the Government crop reports on the con
dition of growing wheat would be bearish
caused general liquidation of wheat to-day.
At the close July wheat was down %@%c.
Wet weather in the Southwest caused a firm
tone at the opening, the "July delivery being
up %@V4c at 8C%<S8CTsC. The firmness, how
ever, was of short duration, sentiment In the
pit soon becoming bearish. The main factor
In causing the change was apparently appre
henston among the bulls that the Government
report would show a considerable Improvement
in the condition of both winter and spring
wheat. That this fear was not groundless
was made evident by the Kansas and Kentucky
State reports, both of which showed an Im
provement of several points. The market be
came weaker as the session advanced, and
before any recovery was made July sold off
to 85%c. There was some buying late in
the day on a decline of 7 points In the con
dition of Michigan wheat, as shown by the
monthly State report. Final quotations on
July were at 8&S8Â«%.c.
Notwithstanding the weakness of wheat the
corn market held up remarkably well, and
the close was practically unchanged from yes
terday's final figures.' July opened at 4S%<g>
43Tic and closed at 48%c.
Although prices of oats were affected by
the weakness of wheat the decline was very
light. July closed at 30%c.
Provisions were active ; and strong. The
feature of trading was buying by a prom
inent packer, who Is said to be short on a
big line. The market closed at the high point,
with September pork up 35c. lard up 15c and
ribs at a gain of 17%c.

after the closing of the market and Its actual
tenor Is no guarantee of what movement of
stock prices may follow, however closely that
tenor may conform to the expectation of those
who bought stocks. The test of the market
will be its ability to absorb the stocks thus
bought when the effort Is made to take proutc
on them. A favorable Impression was pro
duced by the evidence of confidence in the
bond market shown by the offer for subscrip
tion of New York Central debentures and by
published reports of the profits resulting from
some of the bond syndicates recently wound
up.
The official figures of sub-treasury opera
tions have not yet reflected the full payment
of yesterday's transfer of $2,697,000 on ac
count of Japanese gold, but It is expected that
to-morrow's bank statement will have the
benefit of that In its cash Item. The currency

week. Including- this transfer, appears to be
J urward of J7.000.000. Lute renewal of buy-

There was a tip floating around on 'Change
yesterday that this market might get not only
the Hay order for Manila, tout the Oat order
as well. Several days ago It was thought that
both would go north, but the local merchants
have lately been making some very i strenuous
efforts to secure at least one of them. The

for 5012 tons; two pretty good plums.

Receipts of . new Potatoes continued ample
and the market was a little easier than on the
preceding: day, as .the, demand for local con
gumption was legs urgent and few orders were
received from outside points. -Â¦ Old Burbanks
were steady for fancy replcked lots, but dull
for common and soft stock. Onions were plen

Receipts of Green Peas continued very light
and they were the firmest . description in the
market. Tomatoes were steady to firm during
the ; early trade, but weakened later In the

At the request of the California
Promotion Committee four crews of
the San Francisco Fire Department
gave an exhibition drill at the drilling:
tower on Seventeenth street, near Fol
som, yesterday afternoon. Moving
pictures were taken of the operations
during the drill, arid these will be ex
hibited at the St Louis World's Fair
to acquaint the world with the ef
ficiency and equipment of the San
Francisco Fire Department.
Four crews took part in the drill,
which consisted of hose work, pom
pier ladder and belt maneuvers, Ben
gal ladder drill and rescue work. So
rapidly were the maneuvers accom
plished that only 250 yards of the pic
ture tape was required to take all the
impressions of the drill. The oper
ator said it was the best series of
moving pictures he had ever taken..
The hose- drill consisted' in taking
a 100-foot line of hose from -the
ground to the top of the tower while
the remainder of the crew attached
hose to the standpipe hydrants at the
second, third and fourth stories of the
tower and carried the'lfhes to the roof:
One minute and forty-two seconds
after the- alarm four streams were
playing from the top of the tower.

consisted In raising scaling ladders
from the ground to the top . of .' the
tower, up which a fireman rushed.
Once on top of the roof the fireman
seized a comrade, attached him to hia
pompier ~ belt with a rope and de
scended on the scaling line rapidly and,
safely to the/ ground. /
The extension ladder drill followed
and fifty feet of the tower was scaled
with a line of hose within a few sec
onds. The last and most thrilling feat
was when a fireman threw himself at
random from the fourth story of the
tower and was caught in the life net
as easily as an expert -player^ would
catch a ball.
The drill was in charge of Second
Assistant Chief Shaughnessy 'and he
was very proud of the work of the
men. He said it was one of the mo3t
perfect drills he had ever witnessed
in the department
During the trial of the Eppinger case
yesterday Attorney Dunne gave a
strong clew as to the line of defense.
He intimated that as the papers by
which It Is alleged that money was
fraudulently obtained were not signed
by the defendant, but by Bernard Ett
linger, the wrong man was being pros
ecuted.
The case is dragging along slowly,
and the greater portion of the day was
occupied in arguing on technical points,
enlivened only -by an occasional inter
change of compliments between oppos
ing counsel. Frank S. Mitchell, who
for a number of years was employed
as bookkeeper for Epplnger & Co. and
at present is assisting Mr. Wadsworth,
the receiver of the , defunct firm, was
recalled to the stand yesterday morn
ing. The prosecution questioned him
regarding certain books which he had
previously stated were In Epplnger &
Co.'s office and might have been the
grain books of the Pacific Warehouse
Company. He stated, however, that! he
had examined the books and they were
not the missing grain books.- What has
become of these books. is a mystery.
They disappeared at the time of the
failure of the firm, and all attempts to
locate them have proved futile. In
these books was kept a record of the
grain actually in the warehouse, and if
fraud has been committed they would
be of Immeasurable value to the prose
cution. V'** : - â¢?"
Another witness, H. C. Bunker, grain
inspector for the Merchants' Exchange,
testified as to the shipment of the spe
cific lots of wheat on which the money
was loaned. He said that on December
5 he went to Crockett at- the request of
the grain committee of the Merchants'
Exchange to. examine some wheat, and
while there saw lots B 707 and 708
weighed and loaded on the bark Pierre
Loti. This was four months before the
loan was made on warehouse receipts
for these lots of wheat. The witness
wished to refresh his memory regarding
the location of grain piles from a letter
press copy of memoranda made by
himself, but this was not permitted,
and he was excused until the original
can be secured.
J. J. McAvoy, a deputy grain In
spector, testified that he had delivered
a blank form for a report as to the
amount of grain on hand at the office
of the Pacific Coast Warehouse Com
pany on the first of each month, and
they were always returned to him prop
erly filled out by the bookkeeper. He
had never received one from either of
the Eppingers of from Mr. Ettlinger.
The case was continued until Mon
day, and in the meantime the jurors
will be taken out for an airing to some
point they may select within the city
limits. I

Clancy has served a term of six
months for vagrancy and was released
about the beginning of the year.
An Investigation phowed that Clan
cy toad niade a thorough search <n
thÂ«^ library for something that he
could carry away with him and rell
without trouble, but nothing was
missing and when searched at the City
Prison nothing, of an incriminating
nature was found upon him. .,
For the last six months articles
have been stolen from the parochial
residence, but no clew could be got to
tfie thief or how he . could possibly
have obtained an entrance. It is now
suspected that Clancy has been the
thief and that he followed the same
course In climbing over the roofs.
John Clancy, a victim of the cocaine
hafcit, hu^g around the corner of Cal
ifornia and Dupont streets for more
than two hours yesterday morning
and about 9 o'clock effected an en
trance to the parochial residence of
the Paulist Fathers adjoining St.
Mary's Church through a window in
the top story- He had climbed over
the roofs of houses on Dupont street
from Sacramento to reach the paroch
ial residence.
John Baker, the butler, saw him
eliding down the balustrade and raised
an alarm. Clancy dashed out of thÂ«
front door, pursued by Baker, and af
ter a -chase of several blocks Clancy
ran into the arms of Policeman Grun
wald, who took him to the City Prison.
There was something novel In this
quest for a needed drug store. Pos
sibly it was unexampled. The people
were, however, equal to the emer
gency. They wrote to the California
State Board of Trade concerning their
needs and wishes. Manager Arthur
R. Briggs. as soon as he received their
letter, sent out a circular communica
tion addressed to the drug trade of
San Francisco, in which it was asked
that Hornbrook should be borne in
mind. Yesterday a letter was re
ceived from & Cx>., in which
the statement was contained that T.
M. Teass has decided to go to Horn
brook and dispense drugs to the peo
ple. This was promptly communi
cated to Hornbrook by Manager
Briggs.
Some time ago the people of Horn
brook, Jn Siskiyou County, realized,
that among their necessities was the
existence of a drug store In their
town. Systematically they went to
work to secure such an Institution.
The population of Hornbrook is small
and the health of the people, owing
to their climate and their out of door
habits, has been dlsdouragingly good
to any medical man or chemist. But
therA are fleshly ills in all parts of the
world and there are some at Horn
brook.

Charles A. Lyon, who lives at thÂ»
Hotel Xetherland. secured a search
warrant from Police Judge Cabaniss
yesterday to obtain possession . from
J. M. Wilkins. proprietor of the Cliff
House of a trunk containing personal
and theatrical property of the value
of $1000. He says that he and Wllkina
entered into partnership with the ob
ject of taking several performing sea
lions and seals to the St. Louis Expo
sition which have been on exhibition
for some time near the Cliff House>
but Wilkins has refused to carry out
the agreement and also to give Lyon
a share of the receipts, claiming that
Lyon owes him $800.

ing his purpose because he had already
threatened suicide, she went back Into
the house with him and tried to take
the bottle away. He resisted, and dur
ing the scuffle the cork fell out of the
bottle, which contained carbolic add.
and some of the contents was spilled
on the left side of Mrs. Cawley's face,
burning it severely. Maddened with
pain, she ran Into the street scream-
Ing for help. Before she returned Caw
ley had swallowed the remainder of the
acid, and when she re-entered the room
with neighbors her husband fell dead
at her feet.
The associates of the unfortunate
man say that he had been exhibiting
symptoms of insanity for some time.
Corporal William H.\ Cawley swal
lowed carbolic acid yesterday morning
despite the struggles of his wife to pre
vent it and died within % few minutes.
Some of the cocrosive fluid was spilled
on the left side of her face, burning
her severely. .
Cawley. was 26 years old and a mem
ber of the Seventlefn* v Compariy of Coast
Artillery. He had been eight years in
the army and had only a year and four
months more to serve. He married his
wife during his present term of enlist
ment and was very anxious to obtain
his discharge f rom * the ' army. 'Mrs.
Cawley was working as a waitress in
the Palm restaurant, on Market street,
and says that she gave Captain John
son $65 as necessary expenses for the
obtaining of her husband's! discharge.
Colonel Morris disapproved of the ap
plication and Captain Johnson returned
the money to Mrs. Cawley.
Cawley was very morose^ over the
failure to obtain his discharge, and set
tled into a chronic melancholia. He
left his wife's room at 3Q26 Pierce street
yesterday morning a little before 7
o'clock and returned in a few minutes i
with a package In his hand as she was
starting, for her work/ In answer to her
question as. to the package he replied
that it- was a bottle oÂ£ liniment. Divin-

The funeral took place yesterday
morning from the late quarters of the
suicide at Angel Island. The body lay
in state until about 1:30, attended by
a guard of soldiers. It was then borne
to the steamer McDowell and brought
to "this city. It was accompanied by
Colonel A. 'C. Markley, Adjutant Eu
gene McAlexander, Captain J. R.
Lindsey, Captain. A. S. Kerwin, Cap
tain Samuel L. Faison, Captain F. P.
Siviter, Lieutenant H. A. Hanigan and
Lieutenant A. C. Arnold.
. When the McDowell reached the
Clay-street wharf the funeral party
was, received by Major Morrow, Major
A. R. Paxton, Capta'in Charles R.
Howland v and a large number of rep
resentative men from -the Bohemian
Club. The body was placed upon a
caisson, drawn by six magnificent
black chargers. The casket was
covered with the American flag, which
was almost hidden from view by a
great wealth of floral offerings.
Â¦_ Preceded by the band and followed
by. officers, friends and- a company of
the Thirteenth Infantry, the cortege
slowly moved up East street to the
ferry depot, from which point the body
was sent' East* to . the father and
mother of . the deceased, now residing
in Chicago.-* \ .

his death will be .commenced next

It was ajso rumored that he had
been brood*in* over his j connection
with the Madden case, In which he
acted as attorney for Captain Hector
A. Robichon. This case is again to
be opened up in August - and-* it is i
thought, possible he might again be '
dragged into further notoriety and de-|
cided to put an end to matters before;
they had gone any farther. |
"I can see no possible reason for
Captain Wild's rash act. He was a
brave man and was never a coward.
If there was a mysterious something
in the background I do not think that
would force him to take his life. His
affairs are all straight."
Captain Charles R. Howland, who
was also an* intimate friend, could
offer no possible solution. Major
Henry M. Morrow, who was also an
intimate friend, was entirely* at a loss
to account for the motive of Captain
"\Vild"s death. Of course, there are
many rumors flying through the build
ing that the affair with the fascinating
Mrs. Evelyn ' Pittman probably had
something to do with it. That he was
her, devoted friend until a few months
past was a well known fact. For the
last few months, however, they had
been very little together^ although he
frequently telephoned, to her flat and
only last week went to call upon her,
but he was told that she was "not at
home.'.'. /.' -^ ?Â¦*'"?
:A spirit of gloom' pervaded all the
offices at army headquarters. Major
S. -\V. Dunning, in speaking of the af
fair, said:
GLOOM AT HEADQUARTERS.
That Captalff Frederick Samuel
Wild took his own life is no longer fÂ£
matter of question. The examination
made by the surgeons and others who
had the case in charge established be
yond a doubt that he deliberately
killed himself. From the position and
appearance of the body he must have
stood directly in front of the mirror,
and, then pressing the pistol close In
the flesh, directly over his heart, he
fired the fatalshot. His entire heart
and the portions immediately sur
rounding, it were torn into fragments,
causing-' a wound of enormous size.
The bullet passed through his body,
and,, striking his spinal column, shat
tered 'it in' two. Death was instan
taneous.
The reasons and causes for the un
timely end of this brilliant young of
ficer are still sh~rouded in the deepest
mystery. The sensation of his death i
and his funeral were the sole topics of
conversation outside of business af
fairs at army headquarters yesterday.
Noone could offer any solution for his
mysterious' taking off, but one and all
his friends (and he seemed to be well
known throughout the whole army
circle here) spoke of him with the
highest regard and regrets at his un
timely death. .
