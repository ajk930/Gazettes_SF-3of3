Diamonds.
May Throw Light on
Higginson Robbery
inNew.York.
Known as Edward Park, but
Is Said to Have Been the
Family Physician. â¢;:
CHRISTIANIA. Norway, July 16.âEd
ward Park, an American, has been ar
rested here .at the request of the New-
York police. He Is wanted in connection
â¢with a diamond robbery in New York
City.
NEW YORK, July 16.â Edward Park is
wanted in America, the New York police
6aid to-night, in connection with the sen
fcational theft of the. Jewels of James
Jackson Higginson on July 1. The Hig
ginson jewels, valued at something like
J25.000, were stolen and not a trace of them
has since been founfl. It was said at po
lice headquarters to-night that Park is a
physician, but the police declared they
knew nothing of his history.
Much mystery surrounded â¢ the robbery
of the Higginson diaraoncs, especially
when, after the fact had become public,
it was staged that the family appeared
to be disinclined to* render any assistance
to the police" in their Investigation. â¢ An
explanation of this action was offered to
night when It was stated by -an attache
at police headquarters that the prisoner,
\u25bc/ho traveled on; the cteairsnlp under i the
rsme of Park, was in fact a physician
who had been attending one of the chil
dren of the Higginson family. Owing to
the absence of Inspector O'Beirne no fur
ther information was obtainable and all
efforts to secure the name, of the -. phy
sician in question were unsuccessful.
LAZINESS DUE
TO TINY WORM
Tired Feeling of Peoples
of Tropical Countries
Is : Caused by Disease
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. July 16.â Some extraor
dinary statements are made In reiwrts of
the extent cf anemia in Porto Rico. The
subject has been discussed in all local
Insular legislatures, but it seems no one
has bad the slightest idea of ravages
cf this disease until an official commis
sion made an examination of conditions
In the Island, conducted a clinic and for
mula ted Its resort. The whole subject
\u25a0will be referred to Congress, with a re-
Queat for a large appropriation for the
purpose of stamping out disease in the
Island.
In Its official report, the Medical Com
mission appointed by Governor Hunt and
continued by Governor TVinthrop says:
TTntll a general aad intelligent crusade !s be
fun. anemia, will continue to reduce the white
aad . mixed , Inhabitants forming the country
flats cf the isla.a3 to a lower and lower grade
menially, morally and. physically, until - the
existence of this class will be threatened.
la Btimmteg up the situation in Porto
Rico, the Medical Commission finds offi
cially that about 90 per cent of the rural
population In all parts of the island. are
affected by this anemia and it Is evident
that bo large 'a'number of sufferers must
effect the social and economic status of
the country to a large degree. The affec
tion Is curable In a great majority of
cases and certainly subject to restric
tion by the observance of elementary
hygienic laws and the treatment and care
of those already affected. The course of
disease is marked ' by profound anemia
and degeneration of the vital . organs,
leading to chronic lnvalldlsm, which
often results In death.. -' . "V
The report chows the existence of an
infectious disease which Is transmitted
from one to another and is probably re
sponsible for the so-called laziness of. the
Inhabitants not only; of Porto, Rico, but
of most other tropical countries.- As a
matter of course, the doctors have found
the bug which does Â£he business. "lt has.
been developed that the Infection . Is
caused by the presence of a small worm,
the undnaria, in the , Intestines 'of the
patient: hence the scientific name of
unclnarlasis. -

Traction Expert Fears
for Municipal
Ownership.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. July 16.â The "Dalfymple
mystery" has' been solved. The secret
of this suppressed "communication" from
the Scotch traction expert to Mayor
Dunne came out' to-day and revealed the
reason for the Mayor's cable to Glasgow,
asking for another report.
Dalrymple, in this thorough-going, me
thodical Scotch way and with positive en
thusiasm for details, made ,his communi
cation not only a report on the subject
of municipal ownership in Chicago, but
a character sketch of the 'Chicago jfcltv
and traction officials. The report not only
was an analysis of .Chicago's condition
with regard- to tramways and -politics,
but it was a sort of "Who-s Who in Chl
caso." - ' : ;'\u25a0-\u25a0
The. Mayor found ' that I>alr ymple had
"taken his pen in hand" hoY only to 'give
his opinion on traction affairs, but to pre
sent pen pictures of "Chicagoans I Have
Het.'\3Â£kgil3BgifiaÃHHÃtfSHi&RS3i
The document is still dÂ« .; carefully
guarded by Mayor Dunne as it has been
ever since its arrival a v/eek ': ago, â¢ but
enough hasiieen allowed to ..trickle, ou*
of the sale In which it now rests to show
that Dalrymple feared much/ for muni
cipal ownership in- Chicago., because of
the character â¢of the men .- who - would

NAVAL BATTLE
ONLY A FARCE
American Officer Likens the
. Engagement in the Sea of
Japan to Pot-Shooting
NO TEST OF GUNNERY
ItojestYensky's Crews Could
Not aid Would Not
Fight Their Warships
BY JAMES S. TXLEIU
Special Dispatch to TlÂ» Call.
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. July 16.â An interesting
story of the comparative effectiveness, of
the Japanese and Russian navies dur
ing tbe battle of Port Arthur and that
of the Sea of Japan is given by a prom
inent naval officer who has spent many
years on the Asiatic station. For ob
vious reasons the name of the officer is
withheld by request. He said:
"It nas become generally known among
the American naval officers who ara sta
tioned in China and the Philippines that
'England has received many concessions
from Japan in the matter of permitting
English experts to witness the maneuvers
of Japanese warships against Port
Arthur and the battie of the Sea or
Japan. The American officers are not
at all jealous of these concessions, feel
ing that England has done so much for
the Japanese that she Is entitled to
privileges that no other nation ought to
expect to enjoy.
"Two English officers who were ac
corded special privileges in observing the
preparations of Togo for his meeting with
Rojestvensky gave me and some of my
fellow American officers many interest
ing accounts of the Japanese sailors and
their method of training. They also said
much about the unpreparedness of the
Russians and their utter lack of dis
cipline and disregard for detail and per
sonnel.
"We Americans also observed much
more than is generally supposed we did.
and it goes witnout saying that we ali
took the keenest interest in studying
problems that will, have a bearing upon
the future drilling of the United States
navy. And I want .to say right here
that our country need have -no great fear
of the Japanese, although the impression
seems to have bt>come prevalent that the
brown men are incapable of defeat.
>OT MAHVEXS IX GUNAKRY.
**Ttoe English observers declared that
the Japanese at the commencement o^
the war were very poor gunnefs. They
have 6ir.ee improved Very much, but their
standard does not approach that of the
navies of France, Germany, Great Brit
ain and the United States. Their aver
age at Port Arthur was little above that
of the Spanish fleet before Santiago and
far below that of the Americans.
"The Russian gunnery at Port Arthur,
the experts say. was wretched. Nearly
â¢very ship was short of ammunition and
there was no discipline on any of the
ships. The battleship Cesarevitch, when
examined after the fall of the forts ana
harbor, vras found to have fired very
few of her big guns and seemed only to
have resisted attacks with her secondary
batteries.
"The Japanese frequently closed in
with heavy ships to within 2000 yards
and made few hits. At first they were
very nervous about close range shoot
ing. When war was declared th*>y were
undoubtedly of the mind that they had
a hard task On their hands and that
Russia would eive them a terrific fight.
They kept clear of the Russian ships
until they found how poor was the Rus
sian gunnery and this grave them cour
age which resulted in some bold dashes
and some fair gunnery at short range.
"Rojestvensky's fleet was a farce.
The defeat of the Russian squadron in
thÂ« straits cannot be accepted as hav
ing any bearing on the strength or
weakness of the Japanese navy. Ro
jestvensky fought with disconnected
units of his fleet, which seemed unable
to hold the simplest^ formation or be
governed by signals from the flagship.
The Japanese formation was very good
and well maintained, but not extraordi
narily well executed. The maneuvers
followed were very simple and were
the same that would have S been em
ployed by any well regulated navy.
RUSSIANS WOULD .\OT FIGHT.
"All the blame for defeat cannot be
laid at Rojestvensky's door. The ad-,
mlr.il undoubtedly planned his move
ments in advance according: to the .dic
tates of ordinary naval tactics, but his
ships absolutely ignored his [orders.
CJonfusion may have caused this, for the
Japanese subjected him to a heavy
fire, fairly Trell directed, at a compara
tively short range, to which the Rus
sians, because of lack of training, lack
of spirit and lack of everything' else,
could not reply except wild 'shots.
. "Before the. battle of ihe Sea of Japan (
the Japanese had learned that they had
nothing to fear from the Russian gun- 1
ners. The lessons of Port Arthur had
showed them that they could close in
and smash the Russian ships with im
punity, with little danger of being
smashed in return. And' it has since
become known .that Just suah a mutin
ous spirit wÂ«8 extant on many pf the
vessels of Rojestvensky's fleet as has
developed in the Black Sea squadron.
The fight was merely one of pot
shooting. -\u25a0â¢ '-.
"The experts say that the story that
money appropriated for target practice
by Russia was used by dishonest offi
cers to feather their own nests is cor
rect- Before the war. ascertain Rus
sian vessel was in a port of China and
her commander told me that he had
received orders to go outside for target
practice. That night I had occasion to
know that he had reported as having
left the harbor for that purpose, but his
ship never -eft port. Several. daysllater
he made his 'target report' and' said
that certaJn results had been accom-,
pitched.
"I don't think that we have the
slightest reason to fear the Japanese
in the Philippines. We would have to
strengthen our fleet there considerably
to prevent the enemy getting a foot
hold on Philippine soil, but the United
States navy is Immeasurably euperlor
to that- of Japan. This is not only my
own deduction, but that of every for
eign officer in the Asiatic station who
has had opportunity to study the
effectiveness of the Japanese navy.**

Details of Loss of Vessel
With -Over 1 300 of Crew
From Mine Off Port Arthur
TQKIO, July, Itâ The story of the loss
of the Japanese cruiser Takasago in De^
cember last, only published since the de
struction of . Rojestvensky's fleet, is a
military classic. After the Takasago
struck a mine - ant} began to sink, the
crew assembled in perfect .order on the
upper deck/there to await the battle with
a stormy sea and death.' Captain Ishl
bashi ordered every man to use a life
belt and directed that no one jump over
board untilthe ship should actually sink.
The members of the crew then joined in
singing the ijational anthem, cheering* the
Emperor, and lastly they sang "Gallant
Sailors," their voices ringing out above
the storm. After that, as a relaxation,
the men were allowed to smoke, and thus
they went calmly to their deaths. Of 6uu
men who went down With the Takasago,
only 133 were rescued. _
An officer who was Aboard \ gives the
following account of the disaster and ths
remarkable coolness and bravery of the
crew: . . *,"!
STORY OF AX OFFICKU.
The fakasago. fresh from the- Kure dock
yard, where she had been undergoing reral.-s,
atearaed straight to the aiouth of -the Pectin
Gulf Â»t \u25a0 tb-Â» beginning of i/ecember and o i
December 11 she was ordered to .await for a
collier at a point Â«ff Port Arthur. ' The coH er.
however did not put In an appearance owing
to the \u25a0 rough- weather. .On December 12 ths
*ea was stiU high and there were no sign* oÂ£
the collier.- During the dar the cruieer. drift
ed, with the waves, and at night cxoistd slow
ly to the entrance of Pechlll CSulf, She was
net accompanied by another vessel.; At 0
p. m. half of the crew were allowed to take
a recess and the men lay down upon the deck*
Jn their uniforms.
It was an Intensely cold night, with a
geie and snow. At two minutes past mid
night, when at a point twenty-flve' naut cal
miles couth of Port Arthur and on the eastern
side of the - Mlaotao Islands, sne struck a
mine on her PÂ°rt =ide and a terrible ex
plosion occurred, the sea leaping high above
the ship. The crew took up their regular
positions. The mine had made a breach about
six feet in diameter' in the middle of the
water line, of the left side. The water rushed
in with tremendous force and the chip listed
to the left. Captain Ishibashi VÂ«8 on the
bridge and Commander JCakayama beside him.
The crew worked hard to stop the inrush of
the water, but in vain. \u25a0 In order 10 right the
vessel heavy articles on the; left Bide were
thrown overboard, but the ship continued to
list more heavily. There ;was no vessel in
eight $o that the fate . of tho chip as well
as that of the crew seemed sealed. \u25a0
Fifteen minutes after striking the mine all
the electric lights on 1 board werÂ« suddenly ex
tinguished and everything waa enveloped in
darkness with the exception of a light on
the bridge and the glare of the rockets Jelling
of the disaster. Owing to the list, the boats
on the starboard . could not be launched with
the exception of one.' Of those on the port a
steam launch was destroyed and only a cutter
and one other boat were available.
At 12:45 a. m the vessel communicated the
disaster to our squadron by means of wireless
telegraphy and the crew had nothing to do
but to await the sinking- of the vessel, i
Captain Ishibashi on the forebrldge addressed
the crew, 500 in number. . who had assembled
on the upper declt,- saying- that every one on
board should equip himself with a life belt-
He continued: - â¢-â¢ â¢ -
"No one must leave the ship until she sinks.
We W IH together share the fate of the vessel."
PLUNGES TO THE BOTTOM. .
After ' th!s speech there was "solemn 'silence;'
At 1 a. in. the crew sang the national anthem
and at the Instance' of Captain Ishibashi
rousing- banzals were shouted for the Em-,
peror. roe empire and the navy: . Then, the
crew sang- a naval eocg- styled "Gallant Sail
ors." On the conclusion of this song* i he
members of the crew were permitted to smoke.
Owing to the list, the captain and others
assembled on the bridge and. masts and net
ting and waited for tbe hour of sinking. The
waves rose higher and the snow fell thicker.
At 1:10 a. m. the vessel suddenly Increased
hÂ«r list and after once dipping -her masts into
the waves, raised herself with a shudder and
-then plunged to the bottom. Captain Ishibashi
ana the crew were thrown into -the sea: â¢"â¢
The three boats which had â¢' been lowered
from the ship were, fortunately afloat with
their regulation crews, on board. They did
their utmost to rescue . the officers . and men,
but the "fate of - the boats themselves- seemed
at times precarious. A . few minutes J later,
however, a searchlight was observed in .a
southeasterly direction. The light approached
and disclosed to view the Otowa, the warship,
which had come to the rescue. The latter
stopped at a distance of 300 meters from the
scene of the disaster. Illumined the scene. with
all her searchlights and dispatched three boats
to the rescue. At sight of the Otowa, the men,
who had resigned themselves to death, raised
rrlts for help* thus increasing the sadness of
the scene. -
Despite the efforts of the -' boats \u25a0 Only * 133

tranqe-5 to the port of Sidif Abclallah on
July ; 6,' and which was towed into dry
dock yesterday > after Incessant efforts to
raise her, ; : is proceeding t slowly. . Owing
tq . the ; :. displacement ; of the_ machinery
through the action of the water, some of
the I bodies became firmly â fixed beneath
the engines and other apparatus and; the
men engaged in the work were compelled
to attach ropes to the^bodies in order to
disengage them.
It is now apparent that four .of the men
who occupied: the .forward compartment
were drowned; lmmediately, after, the ac
cident occurred. H The j body of lieutenant
Robin was^found lyipg ; face upward with
arms - extended. Near ; by J was â¢ the ; body
of the quartermaster whose jersey caught
in*a hook close to the faulty hatch while
he was trying to; escape.* The eight men
in the after compartment were those who
responded to the divers'; rapping, during
the thirty-two hours after the sinking of
the submarine. jFrom- the condition of
the interior of the vessel it .was seen that

Mass., for the murder of hi 3 wife, which
occurred last Wednesday night, was ar
rested at La Junta to-day by Sherlft Barr
while passing: through the city on. the
Santa Fe Railroad. Tho murderer con
fessed and gave \he full details of the
tragedy which ha 3 been' puzzling the
Massachuse v.Â« police.
\u25a0" He- said that he and his wife were
drinking and quarreling on "Wednesday
afternoon and continued their Quarrel at
a park that night, when her taunts en
raged him to such an extent that he cut
her throat with a penknife and throw
tho' body Into a gully. Thursday ho
started for the West, making no attempt
to conceal his identity. The prisoner ex
pressed a wll?lnsne3s to return without
extradition papers and he will be bela
by Sheriff Barr - pending the arrival of
officers from Massachusetts. . . . .vÂ«.
A telegram frooi Chicago apprised Barr
that the Russian, .would be on Santa FÂ»
train No. -1 from the East. The train
stopped but a few minutes at the station,
but this wa3 sufficient for the Sheriff to
spot the only man In the train. he be
lieved could bear such a name.- His first
guess was the right one. Schi3klovskas
making, nc* attempt to conceal his iden
tity. . - â , . . Â« , . â¢
The murderer told a clear story of the
tragedy. He said he came .to America
from Poland- five years ago . and worked
on a farm near Lynn. Mass. On Febru
ary 19, 1905, he married the woman whoso
murder he now confesses. WhÂ«n ho mar
ried * her. he states, the woman repre
sented that she had 4800 and was but 23
years old. He found afterward that she
possessed but $220 in money and was
more than 40 years old. '
The deception she worked upon him
was the constant- cause of Quarreling, he
says, and these Quarrels- had their cul
mination on Wednesday night. That aft
ernoon they decided to go to California
and the wife furnished money for -two
tickets. Then they drank heavily during
the after non and went out to a park at
night. The Quarrel over the false state
ments the woman had- made before .their
marriage was begun anew and the man
became enraged at his wife's answers to
his taunts.. He threw a rock and struck
her on the : head and, while, she,.was-ly
ing unconscious from the blow, he gashed
,herÂ« throat with a penknife and dragged
the body through 3to unfrequented part
of the park, throwing it in a gully And
covering it with rubbish. Then ; he- re
turned home, slept as peacefully as if
nothing had happened, and left for the-
West on Thursday noon, first returning
the ticket he purchased for his wife and
receiving back W9. , , .â¢,

District Attorney of Santa

Formal Complaint to Take
Case Before Inquisitors

MAY BE PREFERRED
Relatives of Aged Capitalist
Who Was Slain by Young
Wife Seem Inclined to Be
lieve Story Told by Woman
Special Dispatch to The PÂ»M
SAN JOSE, July 16.â Mrs. Kate Hueter,
who shot and killed her husband. Gus
tav Hueter, at 11 o'clock Friday night,
in all probability will be charged with
murder. District Attorney James H.
Campbell, who is investigating the case,
announces th*t the strictest inquiry will
be made into^he woman's story and all
the facts connected with the shooting be
fore she will be released from the cus
tody of the Sheriff.
The attitude taken by the family of
the dead man in the matter so far seems
to indicate that no complaint will be
made by them charging the stepmother
â¢with the willful murder of her husband.
Members of the family are extremely ret
icent about the affair and refuse to talk,
but the position taken yesterday by Dr.
Gustav Hueter of San Francisco and
Ferdinand Hueter of Berkeley in their
conference with the District Attorney rel
ative to the case is a fair criterion of
the position of the whole family. They
are not disoosed to make any charge
against Mrs. Hueter and evidently be
lieved the story she told at the inquest.
In default of a complaint made by some
interested party, the only course open
to the District Attorney is to present
the case to the Grand Jury- Campbell
when seen to-day said that this would
be the course followed unless unforseen
contingencies arose which would make
such action unnecessary. He said:
This efflce Intends to probe the mystery to
the bottom. In taking this course it does not
follow that we are convinced that the story
told by the woman Is false in Its entirety, but
it is our duty in the premises to investigate
the matter fully. The family apparently place
full reliance in the story of the shooting as
related by Mrs. Hueter and I -do not expect
that any c<Â»asplaiat In the case will be made
bjr them. In that event our only recourse is to
the Grand Jury. Just when ire "will be in a
position to present the case before the Jury I
am not 'prepared to say at present. It will
depend on the result of our investigations to
*>p conducted to-morrow. A motive for the
murder, if murder it was. must exist and until
nxcb is found what action we will take is
jiroblematical.
WITHHOLDS OPIXIOV.
Asked if he believed that murder h^d
been done, Campbell replied that he was
not in possession of all the facts of the
case and was not prepared to venture
an opinion. He said:
Deputy District Attorney Herbert Bridges
has had charge o^the investigation and he has
not reported in full to me. I may say. how
ever, as I said before, that we are not work
ing on.nny preconceived theory in the case.
but are striving to so thoroughly sift the evi
dence in our possession as to be able to ar
rive at some tangible conclusion as to the
guilt or innocence of Mrs. Hueter.
As to the course to be taken by the Grand
Jury I can say nothing. Probably "Mrs. Hueter
â¢will be indicted for the crime of murder and
held for examination, but unless new evidence
If discovered the examination will be some
what of & formality and Mrs Hugter will be
released.
Although no member of the District
Attorrey's office will admit that he sus
pects that Mrs. Hueter has not told the
\u25a0whole truth in her story of the shoot
ing, neverhelefes, the air is filled with
rumors to the effect that' the authorities
Rre not satisfied that the woman shot
her husband In self defense. The autop
sy held last night at Los Gates and cer
tain evidence taken at the inquest at
the Hueter residence revealed certain
facts that apparently contradicted Mrs.
Hueter's story. The dead man's eyes
were closed when the doctors arrived
and the position of the body and the con
dition of the bedclothes seemed to show
that Hubter was shot and killed while
asleep.
It is well known that Hueter was ln
panely jealous of. his wife and frequent
quarrels were caused by the latter"s ab
sence from home.
E>*JOYIXG COMFORTS.
Mrs. Hueter remains in the custody of
the Sheriff. She is not conflend in a cell
like an ordinary criminal but enjoys con
siderable freedom. A front room In the
jail, which 1 was formerly the office of
Jailer Cottle, has been fitted up for her
and here she spends the time in com
pany with her father, John Utschlg, who
has been her constant companion since
she was brought down here yesterday
morning. On the advice of her attorney
she has denied herself today to all call
ers with the exception of ' immediate rel
atives and close personal friends. This
move was neeessitaated by the fact that
the room in which she is confined ad
joins the main corridor of the building
on the ground floor and a constant
stream of, curious onlookers have throng
ed the place to get a look at the inmate,
Many of these made attempts to enter
her room, some out of curiosity, others
with the laudable intention of offering
their sympathy to the stricken' woman.
Mrs. Hueter does not seem to worry

NEW YORK, July -16.â United States

grave operation. Dr. James F. McKer

with the ' Senator's condition. At 9:30
o'clock Dr. McKernon left the house say
ing that he would not return before even
ing, unless something unexpected devel
oped. ?;' : Â£4i >
As the ear specialists dla not again
visit the Clark apartments until to-night,
this is taken to indicate that the patient's
progress toward / recovery was uninter
rupted. Dr. McKernon called . at ' the
apartments to-night. He remained but a
few moments in' the sick chamber. Be
fore leaving the house he would only say
that the Senator was doing as' well as
expected. /
While the information made public is all
in favor of the patient, the gravity of the
Senator's conditionals not withheld from

any change will be made in Mrs. Clark's
plans ' abroad or ' that she \will : leave for
home before j next Friday, when she will
be told of the exact condition of her hus
band. . --
The Senator's temperature this morning
was 99. It is learned that it did not rise
above this point during the day, which
is considered a very favoraDle indication.

rest of Private Detective
SAYS HE ASKED MONEY
The Echoes of Litigation in
Which Conspiracy Was Al
leged by Niece Against Aunt
OAKLAND, July 16. â A* an outcome
of a sensational cult brought a month
ago by Mrs. Max Spaete. who accused
her aunt, Mrs. Marie T. Knauer. of
conspiracy to rob Spaete of his money.
F. C. Coleman, a private detective, was
arrested this afternoon on complaint
of Mrs, Knauer, who charged him with
disturbing her peace. The trouble oc
curred at Mrs. Knauer's delicatessen
shop, 1170 M East Fourteenth street.
She declares Coleman is trying to ex
tort money from her In connection with
the litigation between the niece and
ber aunt.
Coleman. so Mrs. Knauer asserts, is
a representative of the Spaetes, and in
that capacity attempted to compel her
to pay bills against property which
had betn the subject of a warm com
plaint against Mrs. Knauer. Coleman
called at the store to-day and after
a wordy war Mrs. Knauer summoned
the police. Coleman furnished bail and
departed witHout making explanations.
Mrs. Knauer announced she would
ewear to additional charges against her
visitor when the courts were open to
morrow.
A month ago Mrs. Spaete, who was
Miss Lillie Guttrich of Chicago, began
suit with her husband 'against her
aunt to recover property at 562 East
Fourteenth street, which the Spaetes
averred had been obtained from them
by fraud. Mrs. Spaete set forth that
she had been Induced by her aunt to
come to California when she was only
17 years o!d and to wed Spaete
through the agency of Mrs. Knauer.
But before the wedding Mrs. Knauer,
it was charged, persuaded Spaete to
purchase the property, for which he
paid, it was alleged, $5000 in cash and
52904 on a promissory note.
After the marriage, Mrs. Knauer, it
was charged, wheedled her niece into
Inducing Spaete to deed the property
to his \vifÂ«-. As soon as the title was
in the girl's hands the aunt, so the
complaint ran, persuaded Mrs. Spaete
to deed the property to her. 'Then she
conspired, it was set forth, and caused
a. separation between the Spaetes. The
ni^ee declared her aunt wanted her to
return to Chicago and offered her $2000
to fly with her. But a great light broke
upon Mrs. Spaete. She sent for her
husband. Ttiey were reconciled and
joined hands to fight for the recovery
of the property.
Mrs. Knauer declares that there has
been a settlement of the contest, that
the Spaetes have regained their prop
erty, although forced to give a consid
eration.
Three years ago Mrs. Knauer was
the center of a will contest in San
Francisco, when she appeared as the
sole legatee and executrix of the es
tate of Ferdinand Knauer, whom she
had wedded under the name of Marie
Taube. There was a suggestion in
the allegations that in Germany Mrs.
Knauer had been involved In irregular
matrimonial entanglements. All of this
Mrs. Knauer vehemently denies. She
insists she is being persecuted by per
sons who are trying to get her money.

BIG AREA SWEPT

Forty Square Miles; 6Â£ Territory
Devastated .-'by Flame. Â§
Greatest Raage/Blaze in Memory
of Oldest InHabitant;
OAKLAND, July" 16.â Within the mem
ory of the oldest inhabitant no more dev
astating and widespread range fire oc
curred In Alameda County than that
which started on Saturday, July 8,. near
Camp Buckeye, east of Livermore. and
burned for six days. The flames spread
over a territory embracing forty equare
miles, extending into Santa Clara, San
Joaquln and Stanislaus counties, threat
ening to destroy the Lick Observatory on
Mt. Hamilton, and almost devastating the
entire region traversed.
Beginning at a point -eighteen miles
east of Livermore, the flames swept east
ward from Camp Buckeye, through Deer
Park, Lone Tree and Ospital. down the i
river to near Vernalis. The fire crossed i
the Arroyo. Mocho and swept up the val- j
ley to the unanganese mines, where sev- j
eral outbuildings were burned. Tbence
the devastating flames continued up ,
through Colorado creek canyon to the
American magnesite mines, where more
outbuildings were burned. .
By Saturday night the fire had. passed j
Mt. Boardxnan at the junction line of ,
Stanislaus, San Joaquln and Alameda
counties.
Another branch of the fire swept the
San Antonio Valley, threatening the
Tfteosophlst Colony at the base of Mt.
Hamilton. The colonists were compelled
to temporarily abandon their Introspect
ive thoughts and studies and attend
strictly to backfiring to preserve their
habitations.
The west side of the San Joaquln was
also swept bare for miles. The Spring
Valley Water Company's lands along the
Arroyo Mocho were burned over.
Tesla was threatened and at one time it
seemed likely that the flames would trav
erse westward over Mission Peak and
descend upon the old Mission of San
Jose. ,
The entire range south and west of
Corral Hollow was burned over. Sheep
ranges in a district whose sides are 150
miles In extent are now bare. . Deer,
quail and other gams In what was one
of the finest hunting districts In Califor
nia perished by thousands.
Houses, cabins, shacks, haystacks,
cows, horses and other, personal property
fell victims to the wide sweeping flames.

X BERKELEY. July, 16.â A myÂ»terio\ia
fire, coupled with the disappearance of
Gianni Oreno," a shoe merchant whose'
place of business is rat 3214 Adeline
street, has led the police of the uni
versity town .to suspect that a fla
grant attompt ( at arson was 1 committed
last night by a person interested in the
destruction of Gianni Oreno's' stock of
merchandise.
: Evidence that points unmistakably
to an effort of 'an, unknown peraon_ to
burn out tha Italian's "shoe store was
discovered this morning by E. P.: Carl
son, proprietor of the business block
on Adeline street in' which Orerio'ssf ore
is "situated. Carlson saw smoke is
suing from" Oreno's store shortly after
5 o'clock. - $ He ; at rushed .to the
back | door, and , began to \ pound ;. the
timbers," expecting to awaken * Oreno,
who. usually sleeps in the; rear of his
store. * There â¢ was: -no response, and
Carlson, fearing that Oreno; would',' be
burned to; death as he slumbered, broke
In the door ; with" an ax.. He ' then
found 'to his amazement that the room
was 'empty.' Oreno was not there and
his, bed apparently" had. not been oc
cupied during. the night.
In. the center .of the .'room, -heaped
high on the floor, : was 'the greater -part
of Oreno's stock,' the shoes being piled
around a.flre that' had been kindled
in the. center. * Scattered about.^on the
floor were bits of merchandise charred
by flre that had been,' started .in,vari
ous parts, of the room^ The blaze had
not been so ; destructive as the: Incen
diary expected evidently, -J. or. "when
Carlson came "he 'had little trouble ">ln
extinguishing' it. Wit was, not necessary
to call out the fire department.
Carlson .promptly reported- all ' the
facts in the case to Fire Chief 'Kenny,
and, Marshal '.Vollmer. The latter, offi-.
clal began an Investigation of the. case,
his flrstwork being an attempt to find
Gianni [ Oreno. ; In :. this he was ! unsuc
cessful up to a late 'hour, this evening. %
. The Italiariv .shoe .dealer had no
friends or acQuaintances In \u25a0 the neigh
borhood." He is /described as a. quarrel
some man,. who always carried
and , made < no overtures to . any of., his
neighbors. Until recently his business
was merely -that of a, (Cobbler. T-. A. few
weeks ago he secured ;a- stockVof shoe 3
and enlarged \u25a0 his : auarters. .- \.<., \u25a0. ;â¢ .v.^
: The building , in j which Oreno's shop
is located was set- on fire^, four months
ago, ' kerosene being poured on an ex-,
terior^wall at "night and a, match; &x>r
piled to \u0084the .'stuff. >fThej blajga*.was> ob-

CHEERFUL BUSINESS CONDITIONS.
LAST WEEK was chiefly marked by its lack of distinctivejea
ture. In the whole field of commerce there was nothing new.
Business ran along on the lines so frequently delineated, of late,
and which are familiar to. all whose interests lead^ them to keep in
touch with commercial conditions.
All current indications continue such as to maintain the optim
ism which has pervaded the country for half a dozen years. V The
crop outlook continues excellent, and while record-breaking har
vests are not expected, there will be all the grain and" general prod
uce the country can use, with a fair surplus for export. The cotton
crop estimates have been reduced, and a io,ooo,ooobale crop is now
looked for, whereas a few weeks ago the yield was estimated at con
siderably over this. Protracted wet and cool weather over the
greater part of the cotton belt has cut down the prospects, sent
prices upward and disturbed the cotton industry generally. Tht
speculative market shot up on the Government report/ but fell back
again more or less, and has been vacillating ever since.
The other staples remain about as' for some weeks past? Pro
visions are quiet in both consumptive and speculative markets.
Wheat and corn have lately been declining at Chicago, carrying
down the other grain markets, including that at San Francisco, with
them. Sugar lias declined. Wool continues firm at the high prices,
and the industry is reported *in excellent condition. Hides and
leather are firm as a rule, with a good demand and no accumulation
of stock, while the footwear factories of New England are reporting
a good business. The cruder forms of iron and steel are quiet, but the
demand for structural material, per contra, is so brisk that prompt
deliveries cannot be guaranteed by the mills. The general distribu-^
tive trade of the country is still active, with indications of a brisk
fall trade, while the general retail trade exceeds expectations.
Building operations all over the land continue large, and the lumber
and hardware industries are correspondingly active. There are no
indications yet that building is being overdone.
Current statistics are still encouraging. Money is plentiful and
easy, with a large world's production of gold, and the heavy over
subscription of the last Japanese loan testifies to the prevailing
plethora of ready cash. Railway earnings, however, appear to be
slowly falling off, being now down to an increase of 5.3 per cent in
July over the corresponding period in 1904, a loss of about 2 per
cent from the increase ruling during the past few months. What
this indicates remains to be seen. The bank clearings make their
usual brilliant exhibit, those last week showing a gain of 32.1 per
cent over 1904, with only five of the fifty-first cities and towns show
ing losses, and those very small, the heaviest being 8.7 per cent, at
St. Paul. Of the greater cities Cincinnati alone reports a decrease
of 4.3 per cent, while the aggrgegate clearings for the week
amounted to $2,802,936,000. The failures for the week were 223,
against 225 last j^ear.
On this coast the signs are especially promising. We are to
have good crops of almost everything, according to present indica
tions. The wheat and barley crops are not turning out as heavy as
promised earlier in the season, but the decrease in yield is largely
offset by the good prices ruling. The shortage in the apple crop of
the East, coupled with light crops of prunes and pears on this coast,
point to a lively market for dried fruits this year, and prunes have
already gone up 100 per cent during the past month, and are still
gradually rising. Prices for this important product bid fair to be
better this year than for five years, while the demand is correspond
ingly increasing, not. only in this country, but in Europe. Stocks of
canned fruit are being^rapidly taken by the consumptive trade at
excellent prices, and the fresh fruits are accordingly stimulated.The
hop industry is active, with prices away above cost of production.
Beans and dairy products are also bringing prices more than satis
factory to the producer, but cattle and sheep are ndtsas high as they
were a year or so ago, while the supply of both is apparently fully up
to current requirements.
The domestic arid export trade of the three Pacific States con
tinues brisk, real estate and building operations are very active, and
both city and country banks report money plentiful and easy at
moderate rates of interest. The feeling all over the coast is one off
confidence in a continuation of the prevailing good times.
DOLLARS AGAINST SCENERY.
THE diversion of water above Niagara Falls for. the purpose of
generating electric power threatens to seriously detract from
the features of that great natural wonder. We do not know the
process by which the dollar hunters secured permission to destroy
scenery for profit. The American side of the falls is a State reserva
tion, and as there will be no falls without water, it .would seem
reasonable; that the State's power should have prohibitive jurisdic
tion of the rapids above the falls. "Canada is as much interested in
preserving Niagara, and there ought to be some way to secure < co
operation to prevent taking all the water out of the river between
Tonawanda and the falls.
It is worth remembering that a proposition to divert the waters
of Yosemite and Bridal Veil creeks above the walls of the Yosem
ite Valley caused the Yosemite Commission to initiate the Federal
reservation, now known as Yosemite National Park. The proposed
diversion of water would have destroyed Bridal Veil and Yosemite
falls. Senator Clark has been fighting to save the great Shoshone
Falls in Snake River. A power company is at work to divert . the
waller of the river above Shoshone in order to get electric power
which it proposes to transmit to Salt Lake City.'
That city already has abundant power generated in Ogden
River, but if no electric power, can be had anywhere except by the
destruction of rare and imposing natural scenery, Met us do without
the power, as we did before this new agent was introduced. There
are enough ways of grubbing dollars without taking them at the
expense of scenery which man has the power to destroy but not
to create.

Bad River, in South Dakota, seems to deserve the. name which was long

half the houses of the village of Pierre, located on the banks of the river

less. The river by any other name would undoubtedly be just as bad, : and

Fete of Flower's in Paris
Dorothy Fenimore.
PARIS, June 25. j
IN" his serial story,' VFair Margaret," i
which began in the June number of
an American periodical, .F. Marion ;
Crawford describes the springtime face
of Paris, "the gajyj incredulous,; frivol
ous,' pretty and Impudent" face of Paris,
which always,' even beneath the per-:
sonal touch ' of ,'the literary genius -of; a'
Thackeray, a Sala or a De Muarier, re
tains its own peculiar personality of
light, imperishable charm.
Every great r city, he believes, wears
its soul upon its face. And this sour is
the spirit of .its; people. ; ; '
Were composite photographs made of
the inhabitants. of the different mighty
cities, each one -would bear a char
acteristic expression.
An empty square in Berlin, says
Crawford, suggests a possible regi-.
mental parade, and in London a mass
meeting; but in Paris" "'it is, a play
ground waiting, for the . Parisians - to
come out and enjoy themselves after
their manner like pretty moths and
dragon flies in the < sun."-
If this is- true of a public square in'
Paris, how. much more is it true of the
Bois de Boulogne, where joyous Paris
loves to while : her time away .on
mornings, afternoons and fete days,
especially in early June, when; Mother
Earth spreads roses underneath the
dancing feet of Love and opens wide
lrer. goddess "arms to; lure him in.
Whoever would see Paris in the per
fection of her careless gayety must go
to the flower fete in the Bois de
Boulogne the first week of *June. Then
coquetry is queen;" indeed over the
Parisian world /of fashionable display.
A garland crowns her brow. Love's
gilded chariot she drives, holding for
reins bright ropes of roses, lilacs, lilies,
that breathe their.amorous sweetness
to the sun. '/\u25a0'/ -".-.-.
' At the fete of flowers we have the
license of the carnival poetized,
etherealized. ' The barriers of conven
tionality are down. ,' Stranger laughs
back" at stranger. Gallantry is per
mitted to pay homage unrestrained at
beauty's feet. Youth sips with smiling
lips the sparkling nectar cup.
. Up -and down the avenue parade the
carrifcfces In tireless procession. Some
are ; like floral* chariots, where are
seated i'gay creatures who look as if
they might be subject to some fairy en
chantment; Others are ordinary^ car
rtages\dressed, up with ribbons and
bouquets of .flowers. And the people
within these are of many kinds and
many nations. ,;./
Parisians predominate, Parisians who
have purses like that miraculous one of
Morocco, the Land of Graft
THE Barbary nations, of which only
Morocco retains its nominal ? inde
pendence, used to be a land of
piracy as it is now the land of graft.
Then, as now, the hands of the European
Powers were tied by mutual jealousy and
the worship of that old chimera, the "bal
ance of power." , Just as Uncle' Sam_had
to break the ice of .'. EuroDeari cowardice
some months ago with his stern demand
for "Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead,"
so a little more ..than a century ago it
was Uncle Sam's cannon ': -that ./stopped
the humiliation which' all" civilized pow
ers endured of paying tribute to measly
little barbarian States whose-; combined
naval strength would scarcely ; equal 'a
battleship of those times,; says the Pitts
burg" Dispatch. The United States, when
it was poor and weak and without a
navy, put up with the shame of paying
Moorish pirates, to. let its ships alone, but
not for long. .VtTHen Americans wearied
of that sort of thing they built a navy,
went over to the Mediterranean and ; al
most walloped the life out -of Algiers and
Tripoli. ; ' \u25a0>" r
A few years |ater England followed our
example. Afterward France did the sen
sible thing and conferred a* lasting bless
ing upon the world; by helping herself to
Algeria and Tunis, establishing ; honest
and stable governments in those coun-:
tries. If France is balked in doing . the
same with Morocco it" will be because a
European dog in) the manger is standing
between her and civilization.
No longer daring to levy, tribute upon
the outside / world, â¢or to * sell Americans
and Europeans into slavery, by s wholesale,
the Moors have taken Ho preying; upon
one another. Theyare said to be a com
paratively law-abiding -race, but that is
because ; they ' have . few laws to abide by.
Travelers say i. that from the Sultan down
every Moor is a swindler or an extortion
ist. Talk about alleged : police graft iin
Allegheny, or in Philadelphia,: or In New
York Cityâ you don't know what graft Is
if you have not learned how Moors make

claim the boy Abdul as monarch. " Even
the ; bearers %of the imperial v palanquin
supposed j they were carrying ; their, living
King Instead of hiscorpse. A revolt led
by r an elder brother of 'the';. boy Biiltan

GOWN OF HENRIETTA, WITH PELERINE TO MATCH.
AyAST number of the summer frocks â and especially the soft and
sheer woolens â are fashioned with a third piece, this intended to
serve as a wrap when occasion requires; but really worn rather
as a finishing touch to the toilet. The material is one of the new
> yellows that are so extremely fashionable in France, and -which are
only just beginning to make their appearance on this side of the
water. There is a simple little blouse, collarless. the throat cut out
slightly in front, and an>mpiecement of embroidery serves as a smart
finish. The sleeve is unusually full and puffy, with lace flounces spaced
between the puffs. The skirt is in a circular cut. smooth over the hips
and falling in soft fold 3 to the ankle, where a circular flounce is ap-f
plied beneath the heading of lace and tucks. The pelerine la In cape I ,'
shape, very full, and with shawl-shaped pieces. . broad over the, shoul
ders and extending in points to the center back and front. A ribbon
frill finishes this all around, and a big loo3e bow and long ends of.
ribbon make a sash in the back.

: Many of the" ladles having the furnish
ing in hand "visited .the: Sequoia Club
rooms at 562 Butter street that they might
note* its - simple" and â¢- artistic theory "of
equipment: for. the. fame "of the Sequoia's
simple and beautiful furnishings has gone
far afield. .':'- . :
Mrs. V.' S. Bradley, chairman ,of the
renting, committee,: reports that the
Sketch Club has. rented three rooms on
the north side . for a yearâ the I first , ten
ant in the new building. As for the audi
torium and.'- the 'gymnasium. :there : are
many negotiations -on file for them, and
applications from five -.othef" clubs await
the -completion of the furnishing com
mittee's workâ all of which is \ balm to
the souls of the plucky women who un
dertook to finance the venture. , f
About that matter of financing the un
dertaking, the bulk 'of .the work was
done by Mrs. Aylett R. Cotton in a man
ner that won the commendation of every
set in the club,- even of those who labored
hard for the election of her opponent- in
â¢94, Mrs. J. W. Orr. Â»
In this regard clubwomen are grow
ing to be fair â they are coming, to see
the good in those whom they may op
pose politically. And \ it's coming from
the erosion caused by -minds rubbing
together. It brings an ' enlarged vision
and a clearer sight. ..
And that's the biggest result of the
women's clubs. They make women
more "' human; more prone to get the
same focus on'things that men" do.
On Saturday the committee in charge
of the reception to be given to Miss
Susan B. Anthony, and the Rev. Anna
B. Shaw met at the Sequoia Hotel, Mrs.
Charles H.Blinn presiding.
The reception, which will be given
next Friday*,- from 5 to 6, at the
Sequoia Hotel, was discussed >in all its
details. . Mrs. Holland, who served as
secretary, precipitated a serious com
motion by inscribing upon .the 'minutes
that Mrs. Blinn would look after all the
beaux. Investigation cleared Mrs.- Blinn
of, the.charge of having selfish designs
upon all the men who might call â the
motion ,: as made .was that Mrs. Blinn
would look after the . bows that shall
distinguish the committee from the
rank and file â and /all was calm once
more among the hopeful suffragists.
'As Xo the reception, -_\u25a0 it promises to
gather together a ' most Interesting lot
of -thinking men and women, who will
come to pay . homage to v the brilliant
woman, who, at 85. is still a leader of
thethinklng women of a thinking age.
As to Anna B. Shaw, she is an equally
Interesting "\u25a0 personality, bristling with
fun, high spirits and forcef ulness.

TUBERCULOSIS
IS DISCUSSED
PORTLAXR, July 16.â Rev. James W.
Lee of St. Louis preached before a
serai-devotional session" of the confer
ence of chiirities and corrections to-^
! day. The services were held In the
auditorium at the, Lew's and Clark
Fair and were attended by a large
number of residents of Portland as
well as many of the accredited dele
i gates to the conference.
1 The general sessions of the conference
! of charitits and corrections .were held to
night. The warfare against tuberculosis
was the subject of one session, and the
other discussed Juvenile courts.
Dr. E. T. Deyine. director of the School
of: Philanthropy of New York, chairman
iof the sub-committee on tuberculosis, de
livered the report of that committee. la
concluding Dr. Devlne said:
Looking at the matter broadly from a na
tional standpoint it would appear that with
i one or large exceptions we are practically
doing nothing for advanced cases; that we are
doing nothing for tuberculous children except
to show by meager experiment that both ia
the mountains and at the seashore nuurretou*
results can be obtained If suitable sanatoria, .
be established. It would appear that we â¢r^TJ
falling to segregate and to give proper special *
care to consumptives in hospitals for the In* '.'
sane. In prisons, almshouses. reformatories and
other Institutions. It would appear also that
wa are failing almost entirely to provide tor
special liberal diet in the care of consumptive*
In their own homes, which has been shown,
under favorable conditions, to be a reasonably
satisfactory substitute for the sanatorium cars.
We are making no provision for suitable light
employment for patients discharged from saaa- '
toria to prevent inevitable relapsa If such, per*
sons return to unsanitary homes and to occu
pations involving unduly sever* exertions. It
would seem that the work of popular educa
tion ha* ooly begun. We still meet people
upon every hand who arÂ« under the supersti
tion that consumption Is hereditary and that
It Is hopeless.
Dr. Livingston Farrand, secretary et
the National Society for the Prevention
of Tuberculosis, read an interesting paper
on "Tuberculosis in Institutions." Dr.
Wood* Hutchinson of Redlanda, CaL. pre
sented his views on "The Open Air Treat*
ment for Consumptives."
Discussions were led by Miss Harriet
Fulmer, superintendent of the Vlsltta*
Nurses' Association of Chicago, and Dr.
Steven S. Wise of Portland.
At the First Presbyterian Church the
principal address was rnada by B. B.
Lindsey, Judge of the Juvenile Court of
Denver. Judge Lindsey spoke on "ThÂ«
Progress of the Juvenile Court." and his
address constituted the report of the
committee on Juvenile courts. Follow
ing Judge Llndsey*s address an animated
discussion of the subject followed, parti
cipated In by several prominent Judges of
the Juvenile courts In the large cities of
the country.

ORT -WELLS A FACTOR

Special Dispctch to The Call.
NEW YORK. July 16.â After all it ie
by no means ctrtain that 1 the claici to
the highest honors of the present racing
season will rest with Sysonby and Art
ful. Ort Well* has beaten Boidaroe at
weight for age and Artful has beaten
Ort Wells, though with an allowance
of seven pounds In her favor, wnila
Bysonby lias made hacks of everything
lie has met except in the Metropolitan
Handicap, when Race King ran him a
dead heat. But now comes Hermis. who
l>eat Beldame in the Test HanOicatÂ» just
a year ago, and shows though he had to
Flay away from races ever since, he Is
as fit now as ever he wasâ is in fact a
thoroughly Jirst-class horse again.
The mt-tropoliuiji jacc goers have little
hope of seeing these three meet; but
{Saratoga should tec a race that will
make history. Though no direct announce
ment has been ma<ie, there is little doubt
that the Saratoga managers will intro
tJut-e into their programme a special
weight few age affair that should bring
together the classiest iield of thorough
breds that has been seen in years. ":â¢''\u25a0,
Sysonby and Artful are lit. Hermjs is
himsc-lf again, and Ort \\>;is is ready to
race for a kingdom. Sydney Pagtt and
August Belmer.t still believe Beldame is
as good h mare as ever looked through
a bridle, and incidentally it should be
remembered in her favor that ' her sex.
naturally has been against her in every
engagement she has entered this season.
Though not absolutely necessary, it is
probable it will need a special race to
bring Eysonby, Artful and Hermis to
gether.

GAME WITH WARD'S PICKED ELEVEN IN A SPIRITED MATCH ON THE
ALAMEDA FIELD YESTERDAY AFTERNOON." - -\
TOURNEY COES
TO LIMIT TEAM
Yesterday was the first lme in several
years, that a limit team has carried off
the honors In a handicap tournament at
the California Club courts! W. G. Knowl
ton and Majpr Ducat of the Presidio were
the winning team and neither had ever
won a tournament before. 'With a handi
cap of "30" and "owe 15"-Â»fr6m the scratch
teams, they won the closest and. most in
teresting tournament played on the club
courts in a long time. The poorer. players
were given larger odds than usual but
the scores show that they did not get
more than they were entitled to. "
It was the third tournament for the
Directors' cups, with seven teams in the
competition. Knowlton and Ducat had
two close calls but kept their, nerve In
tight places and emerged winners. In the
finals they met Melville Long, and Carl
Gardner, one of the three scratch tennis.
Gardner and Long were the cup holders
and would have had a good. lead, for the
trophies had they disposed of Knowlton
and Ducat. Tho final match went the
full : five sets, two of which- were long
deuce \u25a0 ones. â¢ - \
Knowlton and Ducat won the first set
easily but In the second set their oppo
nents turned ithe .tables.. on; them. / The
third set was a long hajd-rought one and
finally went to Knowlton and Ducat after
fourteen games had; been played. Gard
ner and Long won the fourth set easily
and when they kept constantly in the lead
in the fifth set it looked as if they would
win. Knowlton and : Ducat -put up- the
same fast finish in this set that they did
in their other matches and Â» pulled out
the final set by a score of 9-7.
The tournament winners escaped defeat
by a very narrow margin in their, first
match. They received odds of. "30" from
Cornell and Rolfe and the ' handicap
proved ..to be just about right. Cornell
and Gardner. won the first set and were
point set in the second set but Rolfe vol
leyed a ball .out ' about an inch. In the
third set Cornell and Holfe had a lead
of 5-3 and looked like, sure; winners. A
few terrific drives jby Knowlton | evened
up the score and gave victory to the team
that looked to be sure losers.
In, the semi-finals Knowlton and Ducat
received odds ofi'SO" and "owe 15" from
Long and Janes and although they were
behind in both sets they managed; to get
the long' end in each. The score was 4-2
against them in the -first set and 5-3 in
the second, but In each case they took
four straight games and set.
Henry Mills and H. Lund, another team
with a large handicap, made a good
showing. They- won . the first set from
Gardner and Long., but the latter were
too strong for them; in the. second, and
third. In the flrs^ round Frank- Mitchell
and Dr. Bush met Gardner and Long on
even terms and the best tennis of the day
resulted, .Although .Mitchell and ; Bush
had a lead of 6-0 in â¢ the second' set they s
were beaten In straight sets. The scores:
First roundâ W. O. Knowlton . and Major
Ducat (30) beat Ray Cornell and Harry ; Rolfe
(scratch)," 4-6, 8-6, 8-6; George Janes' and Her
bert Longr (owe 15) beat B. TV Nourse and H.

GENESTA WINS
THE ELKS' CUP
The flrsfannual handicap race held by
the Corinthian Yacht Club: for the Elks'
cup yesterday was- a great success,
twenty-five boats starting and twenty
three crossing . the finishing line. The
winner of the Elks', cup, which la a per

The course was across a' line drawn
from Blandlngs Point to a stakeboat out
to and round Goat Island shoal buoy,
leaving It on the starboard hand; thence
to and round Presidio Shoal buoy, leaving
it on; the starboard hand; thence to the
finish across the starboard line. It was
a reach to the first mark, a beat to: the
second and a broad reach to the finishing
line: The wind was light at the. starting
line and also. at the. finish, but over all
the rest of the course It was strong and
steady.
F. Sharpe's sloop Harpoon, sailed by
F.R. Cook, , made .the fastest time round
the course, 1 hour B8 minutes 43 seconds.
Fulton G. Berry's sloop Nixie started
IV4 minutes sooner than the scratch boat,
Frank Stone's sloop Presto, but her skip
per, instead of making short tacks close
' In along | the city front, made a long leg
out in the open channel and finished near
ly five minutes after the Presto and more
than four minutes later than the Speed
well., The yachts,, their starting and

Amid Followers' Cheers
LIGHT AND WIND RIGHT
George M. Barley Makes 96
Out of a Possibly 100
on the Revolver Range
The rifle range at Schuetzen Park
was crowded .with enthusiastic marks
men yesterday. The light and wind
were just about .right -for good scores,
and the assemblud marksmen took ad
vantage of the conditions. The laurels
of the day fell to. the old-time veteran
of the National Guard â Otto Nolte â
who scored the best center of the day
at the bullseyc competition of tiro Cali
fornia Scheutzen Club. His victory
over such a large number of well
seasoned champions was hailed with
delight by his comrades. So close was
his shot to a true center that its exact
position could not be determined with
out the centimeter measuring machine.
George AI. Barley, the expert with
pistol, did very tine work on the pistol
target, making 96 arid 90 out of a pos
sible 100 rin^s- This score is .among
the, best of the year on the pistol range
and. will be hard to beat.
.A v.ei'y plea.aa.nt circumstance of the \
shoot was tho pistol ..match between
Veterans L,. C. Babin and Philo Ja
coby. Both participants were in good
trim and kept each other guessing un
til the final shot' was flred. Jacoby
won by just one ring, the score being
73 to 72. \u25a0
A side match that created consider- j
able interest was won by % four old'
members of the California Schuetzen
Club, William Ehrenpfort, C. Soniiingr
sen, CM. Rousseau and Philo Jacoby.
Ehrenpfort carried off the honors of
victory with three rings to hls|credit. s
J. Frei .won 'first honors in the Griitli

RUHLIN COMES
TO BOX AGAIN
Gus Ruhlln, accompanied by hi 3 man
ager, Billy Madden, arrived in this city
last night. Ruhlln is -matched- to box
Jim McCormick, John L. . Sullivan's
sparring partner. atColma early next
month. Ruhlin looks good and says he
cant get into condition in a couple of
weeks. He will look around for train
in- quarters to-day and will probably
settle down in Alameda.
Kid Sullivan never appeared in bet
ter spirits and he felt chipper and gay
when he finished his road work In the
morning and laughed and kidded with
his trainers, giving no thought what
ever .to -his battle .Friday night with
Jimmy Britt. . In the gymnasium in the
afternoon he cracked a joke with one
of his visitors, a thing that with him is
quite uffusual. He took to his, work
willingly and after he had worked for
nearly an. hour he regretted that his
trainers would not let him go a bit
longer, saying he "was just beginning
to feel good." . Â»
One ' t^lng that was particularly * no
ticeable was his speed. He Is 60 per
cent faster than he was ten days ago,
and fdr this Sullivan thanks his several
rounds" of shadow boxing, each "day.
Sullivan stated he vwould'. continue to
train right up to th* day of the con
test;"the work will bo tapered off some,
but he will do light stunts right up- to
and including Thursday.
has been very little betting on
the contest so far. A few bets have
been made at 10 to 8, with - Brltt fa
vorite, and a number . have been made
at even money that if there is a knock
out It will- be scored by Sullivan.' This
shows that* the impression -Is gaining
that Britt cannot put Sullivan cut and
that if ; he does win it will be by a de
cision at the end of the contest.

SEATTLE, July 16. â The first game
to-day was an argument of . twelve
innings in i which Fitapatrlck was
robbed of a victory in the regulation
way by bad throws by Biankenship in
the third, which gave the visitors two
tuns on one hit. Seattle took the lead
in the sixth, but Gochnuuer's hit in the
ninth, with two men out, scored Nea
lon with the tieing run.
The visitors won in the 'twelfth,
when Waldron registered on his pass,
a sacrifice, an out and a low throw by
Russ Hall to first base on Irwin's
grounder. â¢ Frary picked the ball, but
dropped it and the winning run was
over. . .
In the second game Seattle lost
everything but their uniforms in the
first inning, allowing the Seals two
unearned runs. Seattle could not get
a lilt off Whalen in the seven innings
the game lasted. Davis must have
slept out in the rain last night, for his
voice was done and he used the deaf
and dumb signs on all decisions.

ANGELS WALLOP THE BALL.
Commuters ..Take \u25a0 a : Double \u25a0 Tumble . as
'\u25a0'^ '_'.- . Southrons ; Are "Active.
. Every Angel *on "the : Morley payroll had
a : feeling; in his ; heart yesterday that hla
SPORTS
batting average should be boosted along
a bit, and it happened that before the
sun had ducked down benind Twin Peaks
nearly every southern star managed to
make his average climb up some at tho
"expense of Mr. Ham Iberg and Mr. Oscar
Graham.
The afternoon game was about the kind
that the Sunday fan likes to watch. It
was full of wallops. Both teams went a
few with the club, but the Angels proved
to be the finishing kids, and with a dead
lock In the ninth they just wacled In and
put three over before the Commuters had
a chance to realize what was coming off.
Old Heine Spies was the first man to
start the going, doubling over Dunleavy's
head. Tozier waited while Graham pitch
ed four wide ones and Bernard dumped
one out to right Geld. Kruger was so
anxious to grab the bull and throw Spies
out at the plate that he booted' It in
stead. Both men arrived and Bernard
pulled up at the three-quarter post.- IIÂ»
rested, there but a moment when Flood,
produced a long fly to center that let
him sneak through and tho game wa3
settled.
Oakland started with one in the first
and the Angela camÂ© right back with
another in the second. But it looked aw
ful good for the Commuters during the
next period, when, with two stowed
away, Jimmy Byrnes doubled to the score
and Graham beat a slow one to short.
Old man Van Haltren copped off a pretty
single to center, after Graham had stolen
and Oakland had a nice lead of two run 3.
This thsn increased to four in the ftftn
on a base' on balls, a hit and an out. /
Graham's spit ball went astray in the
sixth, when he walked Flood and Dillon.
Kitty Brashear swung on one that would
have hit the life-aaving station but for
the fence, which cut it down to Itwo
sacks, but let both men score. Brashear'3
hit to left brought in another in the
eighth that tied it up till tho Angels ral
lied next round.
Jimmy Byrnes took a foul off the back
stop in the third that was one of the
hardest chances a catcher ever accepted
on the lot. Right after that Jud Smith
ran' over to the left field bleechers and
grabbed another that looked impossible.
The players rushed the game along and
went through the nine innings In an hour
and twenty-five minutes. The score:

Prom the I'nlaee Hotel Is Fol

Numerous inquiries are beinj? made
at the Pakge Hotel for information
concerning A. B. Clark, a recent guest
of that hostelry, who represented
self as a mining man having large in
terests in the Tonopah. distinct. He
was a guest at the Palace for a num
ber of weeks, but left suddenly several
days ago. His departure was followed
by ugly rumors regarding his business
relations with local people, some of
whom now charge that he betrayed
their confidence to the extent of several
hundred dollars.
Among those who claim to have been
imposed upon by Clark ia P. B. Brantly.
a stranger in this city, who is staying
at the International Hotel. According
to Brantly's story, told at. the Palace
yesterday and later related to Captain
of Detectives Burnett, whom he was
advised to visit, ,he became acquainted
with Clark at the Palace Hotel through
an advertisement, and their short ac
quaintance, Brantly says, cost him $200.
which he obligingly .advanced to the
mining man.
Martin Aronsohn, a notary public,.and
pension attorney of 632 Market street,"
was introduced to Clark by one of his
clients, who claimed to be employed as
Clark's private secretary. A day or
so before Clark left the Palace he
asked Aronsohn 'to cash a $100 check
for him and it was returned dishonored
by the bank on which it was drawn.
Aronsohn has also been Inquiring anxi

the same discouraging results experi

PUT WORKS
BOARD IN A
BAD LIGHT
Supervisors Find It Guilty,
of Falsehood in Eegard
to A. B. Clute ? s Work in
Hauling Street SAveepings
PEEFOEMS CONTRACT
WITH DUE DLtiaEXCE
Complaints Against Him Are
Unfounded and All the
Fault Lies With Political
Employes of Department
As a result of the statement made by
the "Board of Public "Works that there
were 'nearly SOO loads of unhauled rub
bish left on the streets because of, the
inefiiciency of the contractor who was
hired by the Board of Supervisors to
cart the refuse away, the committees
on Streets and Finance of the latter
body met yesterday morning, took the
testimony of Contractor Clute that
there were less than fifty loads of dirt,
unhauled, and in t the afternoon made a
long tour of ' inspection extending "over
the entire city. The committees' inves
tigation conclusively proved that there
were less than thirty wagonfuls of
trash, swept in piles which had not
been taken away,* and that the condi
tions had been greatly exaggerated by
the Board of Public Works. ' It . also
found that in certain parts of the city
the "street sweepers had been very lax
and that filthy refuse was scattered^
about in a totally unwarranted manner.
The committee will meet again to-day
and make ( a report of its investigations.
At the 'morning session Contractor
Alva B. Clute appeared before the com
mittees and stated that there was very
little dirt left in piles upon the streets.
With him he had a crowd of his work
men, all of whom testified that their
employer had told the truth. Subsequent
investigation showed that they had not
lied to save Clute.
Clute made this statement:
"1 have not been helped by the
Board of Public Works in any . way.
On the other band I believe that it has
done mauy things ivlth the direct pur
pose of creating the impression that I
am not doing: ' my work well. I " am
only ,a , few loads ] behind and I . have
only been working a week, and in thai
time I had to Icawi all : the .ropes. In
the future I will be able to' have all
the swept-up piles of refuse removed
without any trouble."
The testimony taken proved conclu
sively that the contractor was living up
to the words of his contract. It showed
that while a year ago each team was
carrying only four loads of dirt a night,
now six, and in some cases seven, were
being taken away by each. Each wagon
holds 2.88 yards of dirt and the teams
cannot haul more than this amount
without danger of straining. Larger
wagons could not be used for this pur
pose unless more horses were attached
to them. . . : - -l^K
CARELESS SWEEPING.
Clute said he. had offered to furnish
the Board of Public Works with teams
for part of the sprinkling wagons at
$4 48 per day, but that he had never re
ceived any answer, to his offers. The
city is now paying $5 50 and $6 75 for
teams for these wagons.'": . .
. Not satisfied with the testimony of
these witnesses, the" Supervisors decided
to make the tourof personal observa
tion. They, started at 3 o'clock in ;the
afternoon and rode through the streets
of the city until 6 o'clock in the even
ing. The first district, south of Market
and east of Tenth street to Fourth, was
found to have about ten wagonloads of
unhauled dirt. Considerable dirt was
found on Spear street and along the '"wa
ter front, south of Market street. Jack
son street 1 was in bad ; condition and so
were parts of Union street. The resi
dence district on the hills above Market
street was found to be in bad need of
sweeping, but there were. few piles of
dirf gathered up for. the contractor to
carry away.. \u25a0':\u25a0 ". . -. ;- .; -'.';/.'-:-\u25a0
DIRT SCATTERED ABOUT.
The Mission was probably ; the cleanest
district of" all. The I sweepers had done
good work and the haulers had cleared
up nearly everything. Valencia' street
was . found to be ;in good shape and : all
the side streets were well kept. The fact
that the wind does , not ' blow the . dirt
around in this part of the city is partly
responsible for the first-class shape In
which it Is kept by the city employes./
. The SnperrJsors returned to , the City
Hall with the facts to prove that the
statement of the- Board .. of Public
Works that Contractor j Clute was not
doinc the work \u25a0in \ proper shape was
unwarranted. They were highly
pleased . by. the energy and skill with
which Clute had arranged for . the cart
ing^ away.of the' swept-up refuse. 'They
were disappointed /at the showing of
the city, sweepers,'; In charge of the
Board ,of Works. In the flushways , of
many of .the, streets' manure and- flying
debris \u25a0\u25a0 had collected, - r seemingly > for
many. wceks> without ' being oace dis
turbed .by an energetic \u25a0' sweeper.' : The'
condition f along Fillmore and - Dcvisa

downtown districts : the â¢ sweepora ' had
tended to their, worlc -, very j-w'ell : and
there was little fault to be found la the

allowed . to . accumulate to ', an astonlsh-

The Supervisors : made note of the ap

ATTORNEY BERT
IS IMPROVING
Hope Is Held Out for Wound
e^ Man's Recovery Should
Complications Be Avoided
POLICE -^BMDON CASE
Attempted Suicide Is the
Theory Accepted by the
Officials and" the Relatives
The condition of ex-State Senator Eu
gene F. Bert, attorney and baseball man,
who -attempted to end his life with, a
revolver Saturday, was slightly Improved
yesterday. The physicians in attendance
hold out hope for his recovery, but they
say that with the first hemorrhage, death
will ensue. A3 the bullet passed entirely
through the lung, ithere is "also grave
danger of blood poisoning or pneumonia.
Symptoms of the latter, however, are not
yet ' , : .:.
The case has been proven to be one of
attempted suicide. Detective tid Gibson,
who was detailed to make the Investiga
tion, has satisfied \u25a0 himself on this point
and Iso far. as the police are concerned
the matter rests. rAn effort will be made,
should Bert's condition become such that
death is Imminent, to, secure _a '\u25a0â¢. dying
statement to be used at an inquest
111 \u25a0 health- is the most probable cause
for Bert's j act. The ex-Senator had ! suf
fered a great' deal and recently this 'Buf
fering has been Intensified by. reason ; of
his dissipation. : Notwithstanding the ad
.\ice'of his physicians that he must avoid
the use of stimulants, he/ drank about
town and- it was only one week ago that
his", friends prevailed upon him ;.to remain,
home f or , a few days and straighten up. \ â¢
Bert remained sober for several days,
bu* on Friday night went downtown and
returned to '{ his old .habits. He" came
home drunk i and the malady reasserted
Itself to I such an extent that.: he raved
all night from *pain. It must have been
then that he abandoned all hope and re
solved to carry out the plan of self-de
struction he had been evolving since' he
secured the revolver on July 6. The
statement that" he' had heard a J burglar
on the rear porch i was probably made
with the Intent of deluding \u25a0 his wife, as
he did not wish her to think that he had
tried to kill 'himself.' .'There has been talk
of love affairs In the tenderloin, but \u25a0 the
police and friends of the man do not be

visors when they made the statement
that there were SOO piles of swept-up dirt
lying on the streets still unhauled. "That
was casting \u25a0 a reflection on our work.
Our trip this afternoon shows conclus
ively that there - are not fifty piles of
refuse on the . streets' and that, ,'bn "'the
other hand, the sweepers have been care
less in manyparts-of the' city; We have
proven what are the facts of 'the case
let the public be the judge."
Contractor Clute assured the board that
he could and would remove all of the" dirt
that was piled up on the streets by' to
day at noon. He states that he has plenty
of teams to. do the work arid'thafhe Is
doing twice the amount of hauling that
was done last year.

BRINGS A SUIT
FOR ACCOUNTING
"Ike" Harks Wants "Swift
water Bill" to Keep Faith
in an Alaska Mining Deal
LEViES ON BANK FUNDS
Litigation Grows Out ofDe
velopment of Valuable
Properties in the North
"Word has reached this city ', from \u25a0 the
north to the effect i that "Ike" Marks,
who Is well known here, -has. become
involved in litigation over mining proper
ties with . the famous "Swif twater Bill"
Gates -and it is expected that a. bittef
fight wilj be waged in the Alaskan courts
by the two men., jj Las^ year "Swif twater
Bill", then claimins: to be in want of
ready funds,; although reputed to have
just â¢ previously located several : rich
claims \u25a0in Alaska, secured financial aid
from . Marks, with whom 'he entered in
to an agreement specifically setting forth
that Marks was to receive 20 per cent
of .whatever profits were derived from
the -development /of the mining proper
ties.-: \ \u25a0\u25a0. :.-\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0â¢. . '
Marks went to Alaska in March and
the ,J last heard from him up to ' a ' few
days ago was that he was "on Cleary
Creek, about twenty "miles from Fair
banks, : where the Y claim* "in . which he
is interested are located. Several reports
reached this city regarding "Swiftwater
Bill", some to the effect that' he had
gone broke again; which would not have
surprised many who \ know { him, ' while
other stories . from , the north, were that
the erratic min*r of many ; matrimonial
tribulations had struck it rich. Â» '
Apparently there was considerable
truth in the latter reports, for, .according
to ' the news recently brought out, Marks
has brought a "suit for an accounting
against - Gates .in Alaska and , enjoined
certain from paying over to the
defendant -$175,000, which they hold on
deoosit' to* the credit* of Gates. It is
cla!*ied. that this 'money is part of the
product ! of the mining claims in which
Marks : and r. Gates are Jointly interested
and : lt -Is 'further claimed that the claims
Gates ; has - been developing aro worth
in the neighborhood of $1,000,000.
The story sent out from Alaska is that
Marks was deceived as to the real value
of the claims -being worked by Gates and
upon finally being apprised of. the | fact
that the man he had generouslyy stak
ed was enriching -himself off of the prop
erties, he carefully investigated the mat
ter and learned enough to satisfy him
self that it was time for him to com
mand an accounting.

Manner of Death of Chinese
at I^nole Brings About

TThetheT It was a matter of economy,
or because it was impossible to segre
gate the remains of the seven | Chinese
who were blown t into fragments in the
powder explosion at Pinole on last Thurs
day morning, the remains of these un
fortunates, or ! all ' of : them that could be
found, were packed into four coffins yes
terday by the "cousins" of the depart

It was a grewsome funeral that started,
from Chinatown 'on the way to San
Mateo Cemeter>'. There \u0084w ere four
hearses, with as many coffins, into which
were packed promiscuously the" remains
of the seven Mongolians.
Another and sadder feature of the grew
some funeral from \u25a0 a Chinese point of
View ' is the fact, that .the * future gener
ations of j the relatives of the deceased
will never be In : a position' to recognize
the bones of jj their.', departed kinsmen
when the time comes , to meet In the
hereafter This was made fevident to all
who understood the superstition of \ the
Chinese ' race /from the fact that while
there was liberaj. distribution '\u25a0 of yellow
paper thrown J from the mourner's hacks,
there was but one solitary. ' "torn torn"
band and no roast pork or toasted chick
ens." The reason of this was that the re

to' the report, ;which no one interested in

John Tait, manager and vice president of
the company- that runs the new; cafe un
der the Flood building, is soon to retire
from that establishment and will be suc
ceeded by Albert Morrison, manager of
the Techau Tavern. ' The same report
says that Tait is negotiating for the Cafe
Zinkand and expects to assume its man
agement. : with a new company behind
him. as soon as he leaves his present
position. -.
When seen last evening Albert Morrison
of Techau Tavern was not disposed ' to
discuss the" reports* further" than to say
that he had not yet been approached by
the members of the Tait Cafe Company
regarding the : management of : that new
concerm Manager Tait â¢of the latter es
tablishment, however, admitted that ne
gotiations were : on' between himself and
those interestedin the" Cafe Zinkand, but
; no ' definite understanding < had yet been
arrived at. : .
\u25a0. "Whether I am to take _tne Cafe
Zinkand," said Tait, "rests entfpely on the
question of terms, which has not yet been

day. It is possible ;that I may go to the
Cafe Zinkand with the backing of a new
