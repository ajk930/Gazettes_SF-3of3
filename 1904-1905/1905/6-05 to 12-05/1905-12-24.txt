gKCAI'SK Mr. Harley made it his
affectation to be boisterously
franl: and friendly upon short ac
quaintance, Storri met no vexa
tious delays in coming to an un
derstanding with him. You are not to as
sume that Mr. Harley was truthful be
cause he was boisterous or his frankness
wont freighted of no guile. It is com
monest error to believe your frankest
talker your greatest teller of truth,
vhereas in a majority of instances the
delusive garrulity is a mask or a feint,
meant only to cover facts and screen
designs of which the victim's first notice
is. snap! when they pin him like a steel
trap. Still Storri entertained no risks
when he broke into confidences with Mr.
Harley. It was Mr. Harley who listened
and Storri who talked; besides. Storri, in
any conflicting tug of interest, could be as
loyuaiious as Mr. Hariey, and as false.
It was diamond cutting diamond and
Orcck meeting Greek. Only, since Storri
was a Count and Mr. Harley one upon
when a title went not without binding
effect, Storri had a fractional advantage.
Siorri and Mr. Harley enjoyed several
casual talksâ that is. Mr. Harley thought
them casual, although every one was
planned by Storri. In none did Storri un
rack his Enterprises; these talks were.
ieolers, and he was studying Mr. Harley.
Storri was , gratified to find Mr. Harley,
by native tiend, as rapacious and as much
the gambler as himself. Also, he observed
the licking satisfaction wherewith Mr.
Hurley listened to every noble reference;
with that Storri contrivedâ for his con
veisationâ a fas-Tien of little personal king
dom en the Caspian, tossed himself up a
castle and entertained therein from time
to time about half the royal blood of Eu
:<>;>e; all to the marvelous delight of Mr.
llaiiey, whom Siorri never failed to wish
had been a jruest on those purple occa
s'ons.
At this seductive rate it was no more
than a matter of ten days before Mr.
Harley wont quoting his friend Storri; he
had that titled Slav to dinner, when the
latter became as much the favorite with
Mis. Hanway-Hailey as he was with her
1 udcV spouse.
Storri saw Dorothy, and was set burn
ing with a love for her' that, if the flame
were le.ss pure, was as instant and as
devouring as the love to sweep over Rich
ard upon the boot-heel evening when he
caught her in his arms. Storri forgot
liimself across table and his onyx eyes
were riveted upon Dorothy as though
their owner we-re enthralled.-
Dorothy felt at once flattered and re
pelled. She was interested, even ' while
she shuddered; It was as though she had
been made the object of the sudden. If
venomous, admiration of a king cobra.
"My friend," purred Storri one after
noon when he and Mr. Harley were alone,
"my good friend, I will no longer refrain
from taking you into my confidence, and
when I say that, you are to understand,
also, into the confidence of my Czar."
Storri rested his head in his hand a
moment and seemed to ponder the pro
priety of what he was about. Mr. Hariey
said nothing, but sat a-fidget with curi
osity. It is not given every American to
be taken, via a Count with estates on the
Caspian, into the confidence of a Czar.
"Yes, into the confidence of my Czar,"
repealed Storri. "See now, my friend, I
will lay bare my soul to you. I am re
solved that you shall be with me in my
\ast adventure. With you â who are prac
ticalâwho have business geniusâ my
Ureams will become realities. Without
you, Iâ who am a mere poet of financeâ
an artist of commerceâ would faiL I have
genius to conceive; I cannot carry out.
But youâ you, my dear friend, are what
you call executive."
Mr. Harley felt profoundly flattered,
and showed It. Storri pushed on, watch
ing the other with the tail of his eye. The
slant survey was satisfactory; Mr. Har
ley showed half upon his guard and
wholly Interested.
"I have conceived projects so gigantic
they will stagger btilef. And yet they
are feasible; you will make them so. You
will take them and girdle the earth with
them as Saturn is girdled by its rings.
Observe now! These, my designs, have
the pood wishes of my Czar, and next to
him you are that one to whom they
are first told. Why do I come so far
with my dreams? I will tell you; it was
by command of my Czar.
" 'Storrl, you must go to America," were
his words. 'You would only stun Eu
rope: you would not gain her aid. -Qo
to America. There, and there only, will
you find what you require. " They, and
they of all men, have the courage, the
brains, the money, the enterprise, andâ
shall I say?â the honor!"
Having quoted his Czar In these good
opinions of Americans, Storri rapidly and
In clearest sequence laid out his pro
grammes. Before he was half finished,
Mr. Harley went, following every word
with all his sense*. Storri was lucid;
Storri was hypnotic; Storri had Ws pro
jects so faultlessly in hand that, as he
piled up words, he piled up conviction
fn the breast of Mr. Harley.
Storri began with China, Being equip
ped for the conversationâ which had
not been so much the result of romantic
chance as Mr. Harley might have sup-
IK>sr-dâ he laid upon the table a square
of yellow silk. It was written over with
â¢ MnnÂ«u> characters which, for all Mr.
Harley k:iew, might have been inscrip
tions copied from a tea chest. As a mat
ter of truth, they were genuine. The
silk wa3~ the record of a concession by
the Chinese Government, it save Storri,
or what company he might form,
the privilege 'of building a railway
across Ch|ha from cÂ»a.st to -west.
He might select his port on -the Pacific,
build his road, and break into Russia on
the west and north at what point, best
matched the enterprise. Also, it granted
n rishl to buy land wherever It became
necessary, and to own what wharf and
water rights were required. Incidental
ly, ao- Storri said, It permitted gold dig
ging. -
"Yon. shall take It to the Chinese lega
tion!" exclaimed Storri. "They . shall
translate for you. ..Yes; it gives, gold
lisrhts. -.Gold? There is so much Bold In
China that your own CalifornlaTjecomes
J^ughkb.c oy cj.iii>aÂ» _ - th^re. ami
fc'torri placed v little leathern rmtch on
ihe lab'e. "There are three ounce:*. Da
you know how they wore obtained? I
spread a blanket -in the ued of a little
stream, and weighted it with stones so
that It' lay flat. Then I took a stick and
tossed up "the mud and the sand of that
little stream, just above. The muddy
water, thick as . paint, flowed over the
blanket. In thirty minutes 1 took my
blanket ashore, and washed from the
sediment It had caucht. and held this
goldâ three ounces! Bah: Gold? China
is the home of soldi But China and these
concessions are only the bejfinnlnjf.V
Storri sketched a steamship line to con
nect his Chinese railway with Puget
Sound. For ' this they ought to have a
subsidy from the' United States. From
Puget they must have a railway to Du
luth. On the Great Lakes, Storri would
have a line cf steamships.
'"Only, we will improve upon Those
lakes!" cried Storri. "It was that to
carry me to Ottawa."
Then Storri unrolled maps and reports
from Canadian engineers which vouched
the plausibility of a ship canal from a
deep-water point on that eastern arm of
Lake Huron called Georgian Bay to To
ronto on La!:e Ontario.
"It shall be two hundred feet wide," ex
plained Storri. "and thirty feet deep. The
distance is less than one hundred miles,
and the fall, less than one hundred feet.
To dig It will be child's play; you may
read the reports of the cnclneers; they
show how advantage may be had of a
Lake Simcoe, and of a little river.. Here
also are letters and guarantees . from
eminent men of Canada thet their parlia
ment will permit and protect the canal.
Less than one hundred miles long; and
yet that canal will cut off seven hun
dred."
Once in Lake Ontario at Toronto, Stor
ri's boats, by way of the St. Lawrence
âwhich might have to be dredged In
places â were to make a stralsht wake
for St. Petersburg, touching at English,
French, and German port?. The .ships
were to clear in Duluth for St. Peters
burg: and in St. Petersburg for Duluth.
They were to fly the American flag: that,
too. should mean a subsidy. Besides,
there must be an American commission
to confer with a Canadian commission
touching the canal. . . ..
Once in St. Petersburg, Storri would
have the aid of his own country in what
ever might be necessary to carr^Â»him
to the western terminus of his Chinese
railway. He had writings in French from
the Czar's government which set this
forth. Only, the Russian assurances were
made contingent upon a standing army
of "Ifs." "If Storri should throw a
railway across China; aVid "if" ho
should launch a line of steamships across
the Pacificâ the same fostered by the
Washington Government with a subsidy
âand "if" all and* singular . the railway
from Puget to Duluth. .the Canadian
canal, and the line of steamships from
Duluth to St. Petersburg â also with a
subsidyâ were once extant and in opera
tion, then the Czar would step gracious- .
Jy in and see what might be done in forg
ing those final Russian railway \u25a0 links
required to unite the ends of this inter
esting chain."
"And you are to know," went on Storri,
"that my government, the St. Petersburg
Government, is paternal. It will give
whatever. In the way of land rights and
loans, is demanded by the exigencies of
the project. -.
"And there," cried Storri in conclusion,
as he shoved maps, papers, and conces
sions. Russian, Canadian, and Chinese,
across to Mr. Harley. "is an idea the
magnificence of which the ages cannot
parallel! It Is simple, it is great! We
shell have three-score small com
panies â that is, small compared
with the grand one I am to
name. We shall have land and banking
and lumber *Rd mining and railway and
steamship and canal companies. We shall
have companies owning elevators and fac
tories and stores and mills. Each will Â»
employ a capital of from two to two
hundred millions of dollars. ' Over all.
and to own the stock of those smaller
ones, we must throw a giant company.
Do you know what It will require? Do
you realize what its capital must be? It
will call for the cost price of an empire,
my friend; It will demand full thirty bil
lions! Think of the president of such a
company! He will have rank by him
self; he will tower above kings. What
shall we call it? Name It for that mighty
Portuguese who was first to send his ship
around the globe: name it Credit Ma
gellan!" v
Mr. Harley wiped the sweat from his
forehead. It was a day in October, one
reasonably cool, and yet, when Storri'
ended with his Credit Magellan and came
to a full stop. Mr. Harley was in a per
spiration. It was those thirty billions
that did It. Mr. Harley was no stole
to sit unmoved in the presence of such
\u25a0wealth, and the graphic StorriÂ« made
those billions real.
When Storri had done, Mr. Harley
gulped and gasped a bit, and then asked
If he might retain the armful of papers
for further consideration. He would like
to go over them carefully; particularly
those Canadian reports and assurances
that related to the canal.
"My dear, good friend," cried Storri,
with a magnificent wave of the hand,
"you may do what you will!"
There are men. reckoned shi'cwd 'in
business, whose shrewdness can be over
come by ciphers. It Is' as .though they
were wise up to seven figures. Mr. Har
ley was of these; he had his boundaries.
His Instincts were solvent, his policies
sound, his suspicions full of life and
courage, so that you went no higher
than nine millions. Burdened beyond that,
his Imaginations would break down; and
since his Instincts, his policies and his
suspicions rested wholly upon his imag
natlon, when the latter fell the others
must of need go. with it. There ij a
depth to money just as there Is to a lake;
when you led Mr. Harley in beyond the
nlne-milllon-dollar mark he began to
drown. When Storriâ Pclioii 4 upun Ossaâ
piled steamship on railway, and canal on
steamship, and banking and lumber and
miniiig and twenty other companies' on
top of these, Mr. Harley was dazed and
benumbed. When Storri' concluded and
capped all with his Credit Magellah, cap
ital thirty billions, it was, so faras Mr.-
Harley is to be considered, like taking. 'a
child to sea. In the haze and the blur
of it. Mr. Harley could see nothing, say
nothing; his impulse was to be alone and
collect himself. He felt as might " one
who has been staring af the sun. Storri's
picture of an enterprise co vast that it
proposed to set'' out the -world like a
mighty pan of milk, and skim the "cream
from two hemispheres, dazzled him and
caused his wits to lose their, way."
At the end of three days^, Mr. Harley:
had begun to get his bearings; he was
still fascinated, but.the fog was. lifting.
Step by step he went over Storri's grand
proposals; and, while he had now his
eyes, each step seemed only to take him
more deeply into a wilderness of admira
tion. That very admiration \u25a0 filled him
with a sense of dull alarm. He resolved
to have other counsel; than his own.
Were he and Storri to. embark upon this
world-girdling enterprise, they, must have
ALFRED
HENRY
LEWIS
money-heii.. <.'*e would take the project"
to " certain money-loving souls ;' he would \u25a0
get their opinions by asking their aid.
Mr. Harley went to New York and
called about him a quintet of gentlemen,
each of whom had been with *him and
Senator Hanway in more than one affair
of shady profit. Mankind does not change,
its methods change, and trade ( has -still
its Kidds. and Blackbeards. â¢ Present com
merce has its pirates and its piracies;'
only the buccaneers of now do not launch
. ships, but stock ; companies, while Wall'
and Broad streets are their ' Spanish
Main. They do "not, like Francis Drake,
lay off and qh at the Isthmus to stop'
plate ships; they seek their palleons;4n
the Stock Exchange. Those five to gatnier;
at- tlie call of Mr. Harley were of \ our
modern Drakes. He told them, under seal
of secrecy, Storri's programme, and -put
before them the documents, Russian, Ca
nadian and Chinese. , -.
Mr. Harley felt" somewhat justified of
his own enthusiasm when he observed
the serious glow UT the eyes of those five.-
They sent to Mott street, and brought
back a learned Oriental to translate the
Chinese silk. The Mott street one, him
self a substantial merchant and a Mongol
of high caste, appeared wrapped in' rus
tling brocades \u25a0 and an odor'= of opium.
When he beheld the yellow silk he bent
himself, and smote the floor three times
â¢ with r his forehead. 'More than anything \u25a0
told by Mr. Harley did this profound
obeisance of the; Mott street Oriental
leave its impress upon the . five." They,
themselves, bowed ;to nothing save gold;
the silken document- must record a fran
chise of gravity and money-moment to
thus set their visitor to beating the carpet
â¢with his head! Having done due honor to
the Emperor's signature,; the Mott street
one gave Mr. Harley and his friends the
silken"- document's purpQrt in English.* It
granted eveqy . right, railway, wharf and
gold, asserted by Storri. Then Mr. Har
ley wired' that nobleman to join them In
New York.
Storri had not -been informed of Mr.
Harley's Now York visit. But he had
counted on it. and the summons in
no wise ' smote '\u25a0 him with surprise.
Once with . Mr. Harley and the ad
venturous fivo, Storri again Went over
his project, beginning' at the Chinese
Railway and closing with Credit Magel
lan, : capital $30,000,000,000. Not one , who
heard went unconvinced; not one but was
willing* to commence in practical fashion
the carrying out oorf r this high > financial
dream. . - ' ;
It was the romanceâ for money-making
has its romancesâ and the adventurous
uncertainty of the thing; the pushing' into
the unknown, j which ' ; formed i the \u25a0'â¢"\u25a0 lure.'
Have . you . ever \ considered that nine oC
ten among those who went with De Soto
and Balboa and Coronado and Cortez a-ml
Pizarro, if asked by some qu!et neigh
bor, would have refused him the loan of
$100 unless secured by fivefold the valuo?
-And' yet the last' man jack would peril
life and fortune blindly in a voyage to
worlds unknown, for profits guessed. at,
against dangers neither to be counted npr
foreseen. Be not too much . stricken of
amazement, therefore, -.when now these
cold ones, who would not have bought an
American railroad without counting the
cross-tiesT and weighing every spike, and
fish-plate, were ready to send millions
adrift |on a sightless invasion of ' Asia
10,000 miles away.; Besides, as the fivs with

They would begin with a "bear" move

lief. if the market were properly un
dermined, that- Northern Consolidated
could be sold down below 20, possi
bly; as low. us 15. When It had
"reached lowest levels they would make!
their swoop. The pool would have enough
profit from the "bear" movement to pay.
for the road. If they succeeded in sell-,
ing Northern Consolidated off twenty
pointsâ and they believed,, by going cau
tiously and intelligently to work, the
feat was .easyâ the profits would equal
the purchase sum required.
In "bearing", the stock and breaking
it down to a point where the pool might ,
seize upon the road without risk or out
lay on Its own intriguing part, the potent ,
Senator Hanway would come in. At the ,
beginning of Congress he must offer a '
Senate resolution, for. a special commit-,
tee of three to investigate certain claims

dated. That corporation had long owed
the Government, no one knew how much.
It had stolen timber and stripped moun
tain ranges with Its larcenies; also it ,
had , laid rapacious paw. *ipon vast ;
stiotthes of "the public domain. It was
within the power jof | the committee, act- \

were almost too high for estimation, and:
without which the road could not exist

than . Storri at the. time possessed, but
he did not propose to have the others dis
cover the fact. Somehow he would scrape
together those, fifty thousand; his note
might do. Being, like every savage, a
congenial gambler, Storri went ; into' the
pool with zest as well as confidence, ' and
rejoiced, in speculation that offered
chances wide ; enough to employ his last
dollar in tho stake. Moreover, those four
millions would not "be asked for, before

Ing fifty thousand.
;Mr. Harley. laid the Storri project, and
the plans of the pool to seize Northern
Consolidated, before Senator Hanway.
That candidate for the Presidency knitted
his brow and pondered the business. As
"with Mr.. Harley and the pirate five, the
mad grandeur of the idea charmed him.'
One element seemed plain; there could
come no'frvss from the raid on Northern
Consolidated. He might go' that far witii
safety, and. a- certainty of profit: for in
the Senate committee of investigation lie!
himself, would play the controlling care.
; : "The. proposal," said Senator .Hanway,.
when he- and -Mr. ; Harley' conferred,
"while gigantic in Its unfoldment, scem^a
reasonable one. After all, it Is I the :
amount involved that staggers rather'
than what obstablea must be overcome.
Taken piecemeal. v I do not say that the
entire scheme, even Credit Magellan,
with Its thirty billions, may not . work
through. \u0084 The resolution naming, a com
mittee " to. look into . the claims - ana
charges, against Northern. Securities
ought to help my Presidential canvass.
It cannot avoid telling In my favorwith
thoughtful v men. \u25a0 They will see that I
am- one who is jealously guarding public
Interests." , . . ' .
"Ani the resolution.", suggested Mr.
Harley. "appointing a commission for the
Canadian canal, and inviting, the Ottawa
government .to .do the same, ought
. also to * meak in your ' favor. . : Consider
what an impetus' such a waterway would

- '-.: The various conferences over-. Storri's
enterprise and the consequent coming to

j Mr. Harley Iwould' not "trust' Storri -to" dl-
vide .profits with him where the case- rest
ed only upon, that Russian's honor. No
more would. he draw his own check, for
Storri's margins; and one day our noble
man lost money because of Mr. Harley's
cautious delicacy In that behalf. The mar
ket went the wrong way, and Storri could
not s be found when additional margins
'were called fpr. Whereupon Mr. Harley
closed out his. friend at a loss of $7000.
Storri knitted his brows when he knew,
but offered no comment. In fact, he treat
ed the affair so lightly that Mr. Harley
'felt relieved; that latter speculator t had.
been somewhat disturbed In his mind con
"cerning Storri's opinion of what, to give
it a best description, evinced niggard dis
trust of Storri, and cast In negative fask
ion a slur upon that gentleman.
Mr. Harley was too ready with his be
lief in Storri's Indifference; that the lat
ter, for all hi 3 surface stoicism,. took a
serious, not to say a revengeful, view of
.the business, found indication on a later
painful day. The experience taught Storrl
that he might expect neither favor nor
generosity from Mr. Harley; and this,
'considering how,, in all they roust ad
venture in Credit Magellan Mr. Harley
would have him In hia power, filled Storri
â¢with an .angry .uneasiness. ; He decided
that for hia own security. If nothing more,
he might better bestir himself to gain. a
counter grip upon Mr. Harley. And there
upon Storri began to He In ambush for
Mr. Harley; and at a lurking, sprawling
warfare >that sets gins and deadfalls, and

<makes a formidable soldier. '
Storri, wisely and without price, had one
-day aided a sugar company in securing
Russian foothold in Odessa. . That aid. was
ground-bait meant' to lure the sugar fa
vor. This' sugar company made more
profit on its stocks, than. on Its sugar. It.
was in the habit, -with one device or an
other, of : sending the quotations of Its
shares up and down like an elevator. In
requital of that" Odessa good, the presi
dent of the sugar company, the week
after, r gave Storrl a private hint to sell
sugaristock., Storri responded by placing
an order; selling 10,000 shares.,.
Storri , took no one Into his confidence
touching sugar. . poing the other way, -he
urged, Mr. Harley '.to buy on their mutual
account", 2000 shares, assuring ; him ,that
he had been given word, from sources ab
solutely sure, of, a comlns "bull"-: move

Mr. Harley, who knew of that Odessa

. ."I don't want any argument to exist,"
laughefl Storrl. as he gave .Mr. Harley
ths French securities, "Tor closing ma out

I shall go to the club."
Mr. .Harley also laughecV and took- thÂ«
French stock: acceptance always cams
easy, with Mr. Harley. ' \u25a0 Â« - ..
Mr. Harlev bought those two thousand!
sugar shares at eleven o'clock. . Two
hours later an extra was betas cried
about the streets. The sugar company
had ordered half of its refineries closed |

was given as the reason.
With .the order â¢ closing down tho re-^

Within thirty minutes It had "slumped

The security was undeniable, but a

On the back, however, there, was \no

Although Congress had begun . its
session. no change was made -ir
\u25a0those morning calls of -Richard
who carrir religiously at clever
to listen to Senator Hanway and look at
Dorothy. The latter young lady was
never absent from the interviews; she
had conceived, a wonderful interest in
politics, and savej her "Uncle Pat" no
peace. Richard's 'call commonly lasted
but a half-iiour, for Senator ' Hanway
must be In the Senate chamber at noon.
Thirty heavenly minutes they were; Dor
othy and Richard promised arid again
promised undying love to one another
with their eyes. Senator ILinway never
suspected this love-making, never inter
cepted one soft glance; for your politician
is like a horse wearing 1 blinkers, seeing
only the road before him, thlnklnsr of
nothing but himrelf. One morning after
Senator H.inway had departed. Dorothy
took Richard across to meet the blonde
pythoness. Dorothy said she wanted
Bess to s*e Richard, of whom she was
privily proud. '
The Marklins lived across the street
from tr-e Harley house. Mother Marklin
was an Inva'id an<l seldom . cut of her
own room. Father ' Marklin was <lead.
and had been these five years. When
the situation promoted her to be the liead
of the Markiin household, Bes3 had taken
on a quiet, grave atmosphere of author
ity that was ten years older than her
ag<=.
The Marklins were fair rich. Father
Marklin had been a physician whose pa
tients were women of fashion; and that
makes a practice wherein your doctor
may know less medicine and make . more
money than In any other walk of drugs.
A woman likes big bills froti a physi
cian If the malady be her own; she
draws importance from the size . of the

nothing to some women except; their
achis and their ailments. It ail seems ra
tional enough. These be dangerous di

drug-dealing parent of Bess, who visited
th t fair sufferers In a. Brewster brough
am and measured out. his calls by. min
utes, watch in hand. I He heaped up-a
fortun<- for Bess and her raptn'cr, and
then at one. and the same moment quit
both his practice and the. world.
Wh<?n Dorothy came, in with Richard,

Mr. Fooling was. equally silent through
fear of overwhelming himself. Released
from Richard. Mr. Fopling found refuge
la the 'chair he had quitted, and ma:n
taiijud himself without sound or motion,
bolt upright, staring straight ahead. Mr.
Fupling had a vacant expression, and his
fate was not an advantageous face. .It
was round, pudgy, weak, with shadows of
p^tulancv about the mouth, and the fore
head sloped away at an ansle which
house-builders, . speaking of roofs, call a
QUarter-pitchJ His chin, acting on the
bint Â«lterÂ« d by the forehead, was likewise
to full retreat. Altogether, one might
have said of Mr. Fopling that if he were
not a dt-lightful. at worst he would never
become a dangerous companion^ Richard
surveyed him wii.i * deal of curiosity;
thon he questioned Dorothy with a glance.
. "Bess is to marry him," whispered
Dorothy.
"What fur?" whispert . Richard, off hi*

"Is she?" said Dorothy, viith a falling

The two win.- near a .window and quite

I That morning Richard had been flat
tered with a letter from the. editor o(
a magazine, asking for a five-thousand
word article on a leading, personality
of the Cabinet. This, helped him bear
tho raillery of Bess;, and the raillery,
per incident, told- him how, much and
deeply he was in the thoughts of Doro
thy, which Information made the world
extremely beautiful. Richard had wait
ed until, his thirtieth year to begin to
live! He was brought back from a

"Inflame what?" asked Richard.

Mr. Fopling. was emphatic; and -when
Mr. Fopling was emphatic he squeaked.

not have had to do wivh the younger

Richard, now that the â¢ Daily Tory let
ters wire winning praise, that Is to say,
were being greatly applauded and con

mightier prioe than ever. Educated those
year.-; abroad, he felt the want of<an
American knowledge, and sfsrled in to
study government- at .point-blank range.-
Nights hu read history, mostly .political!,
and days he went about like a Diogenes

f'oplhijr feeling toward the press pre-:
3oininate-d "at the j club,' and although
Richard was never openly snubbedâ his
â¢liuulucrs were too wide for thatâ besides.
iomÂ«: sigh of those hand-grips with Storri
had gone aboutâ the feeling was jpanifest.
fhis cool distance pleased Richard rather
than othtrwlse, and he went often to tht
:lub : to enjoy it. It was parcel of his
ift'tcted Â«'yniclsm to like an enemy. .
Whfn Richard came to- Washington It is
â¢nore than a chance" that he was a pa -
Lroit.' But !ie he went about' he; saw
nuch to blunt the sentiment/ A statesman
s one who helps his country; a : politi
cian (s one who helps himself. Richard
found shoals of the latter and none of the
ither class. One day he asked Speaker
frost, whom he met In Senator Han
way's study, his 'definition of, a states
nan.
:"A statesman." said, that cpigramist,
'is a dead politician."
Richard frequented House- and Senate
?allenes; it was interesting to watch the
lotablfs transacting- their fame. The de
t>at*K were a <yoss-fl re of deceit. Not a
member gave his" true reasons for ' the
k'otes he cast; he gave what he wanted
the world to think were his reasons.
Finance was on the carpet in that- hour.
Â»nd bimetallism and monometallism, ?il-,
fcr versus "gold, ' t were In "-\u25a0 every one's
nouth. Richard saw that .the; goldbugo
lailed from- money-lending constltuen"-"
while tho *llverbugs v/ere invariably
from cither money-borrowing constitu
encies or constituencies that had silverto
sell. And every man legislated for his
listrict and never for the country ;*whlch
Richard rrgarded as an extremely narrow
â¢ourse. Kyery man talked. of the people's;
nterest; i Very ;man was thinking of his
>wn Interest and striving only to locate

â¢ ions,' and occupied -both ; sides -of . -th
mmiey question without becoming -th'

- Not .alone did .Richard,- gazing fron
"the galleries, lose faith, in the patrlotlsn
of -House; and Senate, men, .but .he begai
to doubt the.verity of their partisanship
Considering* what- they :' did, rather thai
what they said. .he discovered . that ; th'
true difference between- the two .great po
litii-al parties was the difference betweei

}y in the noises they made.\ When It cami

mentâ that',is to say, the thing control
ling and not the thing controlled; it wa;
made up "of the President., the Speaker
%and a , dozen more in Cabinet and Con

The picture nourished Richard's failing
of cynicism,. and served to dull that cdgi
.of I native patriotism., which It was as

ton was already beginning to regard him
I Neither did -he : escape forming oertalr
estimates- of Senator Hanway, and the
white purity â¢of i' what ] motives underlaj
hi,Â« public career. For all that, Richare
"was . quite ;' as-sedulous as ever to ad
vance our statesman's fortunes; loyaltj
is abstract, love concrete, and in a lasl
analysis Richard was â¢ thinking on Doro

space'for. anything else.; There was,
however,, one/ characteristic, common
to Southern men, which was wantiny
hi' folk : from other- corners of the coun
try, "Richard never met a" Southern
man , who. remembered," assuming such
to be his official station, that he was
in Cabinet or Congress,- while he never
met a Northern or a- Western- or a New
England man who for a moment for
got it. ; / . \u25a0 :\u25a0 /\u25a0" '
This amiable democracy on the
Southern part, like other good things,
has. its explanation. - Your - Southern
man. like a squab pigeon, is ' biggest
when lie is born. The one first great
fact of -his nativity is an -honor be
yond any ' other ' which the world can
confer, it is as though he were cradled
on a peak; and thereafter, wherever
his wanderings may take him, and
whether Into Congress, Cabinet or
White House, -he travels always.down
hill.: It is this to account for that be
nignant urbanity, the inevitable mark
of a Southern man, which teaches him
faith in y6u as corollary of completed
confidence in himself. It is a beautifiy,
even though an unreasonable trail,
and as, such the admiration of Richard
recorded it. â¢ / .
Those others, not Southern, educated
to a notion of office as a pedestal,
were, inclined to play the. turkey^ cock
and spread their tails a trifle. Since that
sort of self-concolt never falls to tran
sact itself, at the cxponse of thespec
tator, Rieiiard looked upon " it with /no
favor, and It drew from him opinions,
not of .compliment.' concerning those
by whom "it was exhibited. .It set him
to. comparisons which ran much in
Southern favor. ; -

After '^lCUihard Senator -: Hanway
iiponftheiNortherri Consolidated^ evening,
he ran'fplurdp" iipSn an incident that was
to have a Mast profound effect upon this
history. , No^ohe^not a prophet ; would
ha ve â¢ gnesst'd \ this from ' the incident's '
character; | for on It 3 ignoble face it was
nothinsrbetter than just a drunken clush
betv/een \u25a0 a'Caucasian and,- an 'African â¢ tri
univiratti that had iccKed horns with him
in the street. The Caucasian, moved of . â¢
liquor and pride of skin, had demanded
the entire sidewalk. He enforced his de
mands by shoving the obstructing Afri
cans into the gutter. The latter, recalling
amendments to the organic law of j the
land.favorable to folk of color, objected.
In the war. that followed, owing to an in
equality! of .forces, the Caucasianâalbeit a
gallant soulâ was. given the' bitter side of
the argument. Richard came upon them
as he rounded a corner;, the quartet -at
the time made a' struggling, scrambling,
cursing tangle, rolling.; about the side-,
walk. ; ' v
Being one in whom the race instinct ran
powerfully, and who was not untainted of
antipathies to red men and- yellow men
and black men and all men not wholly
white, Richard did not pause.- to .inquire
the. rights and the wrongs of the alterca
tiop. He-seized upon the toprnost~ person
of color and pitched him into the street.
Then he pitched another, after him. The
third,- getting some- alarming notions of
what was going on. arose and lied.. None
of, the three came back; for discretion Is
not absent from the African,, and. those
whom. Richard personally disposed of felt
as might ones wlio had escaped from some
malignant provjdtnce which they r did not

tafed. The gentleman shook- himself and
announced that he was. uninjured. Then

CHAPTEU VIII. ;â¢_.-
. Storri Wooed' Mrs.' rHanway-
Harley. /.--.'.
r Storri was a' sensualist to .his fingers'
ends.''; Being a sensualist," he was per
force an egotist, and the smallest of
his - r deslres became the star ;by which
he laid -his course. Through stress of
â¢ appetites,' 7 as powerful as tljey ] were
gross,; he-had; grown -sharp to calcu
late'and quick to see. -He was con
\u25a0 trolled and - hurried down by currents
.of a : turb.id ' selfishness; nor would he
have stopped at any cruelty, balked at
â¢ any prime, when prompted of Â» what
; brute ;- hungers, kept his soul awake.
He- might have wept over failure,
never 'from remorse. And Storrr had
â set his savage heart on Dorothy.
>. Dorothy felt an aversion to Storri,
and, she could not have told you -why.
The mystery of It, however, put ' no
questlon ; to her; she yielded with
'folded hands, passive to its influence.
She-did not hate Storri." she shrunk
from him; his nearness chilled her. like
the nearness of a reptile. Kipling, the
matchless, tells how a Russian does
: not become alarming until he tucks In
hisrshirt and Insists upon' himself as
-.the most Eastern of -Western peoples
.instead of the most Western of East
ern peoples. - There Is truth to sit at
the bottom of this. Dorothy would have
met Storri with Indifference had that
nobleman seen fit to catalogue himself,
socially, as a Kalmuck Tartar, not of
â¢ her strain and tribe; she was set
. a-shudder when made to meet him un
der conditions which admitted the pro
priety of marriage between them,
should sne and he agree. As it stood,
Dorothy was aiivc for flight the . mo
ment btorri stepped into her presence:
'stie knew by intuition the foulness of
his fiber and 3hivered at any threat of
contact therewith.
: Storri was aware of Dorothy's dis
like, since aversion is the one senti
ment a woman cannot conceal. The
discovery only made him laugh. He
was too much the conqueror of women
to- look for failure here. * Should he,
Storri, who had been sighed for by the
fairest, of a dozen stately courts, re
ceive defeat from a IKile American?
Bah! he would have "her "at his ease,
win her at his pleasure! Dorothy's ef
forts to avoid him gave \u25a0 pursuit ; a
piquancy!
While Storri noted Dorothy's distaste
for him, -he did. not get slightest slant
of her tender, preference .for Richard.
As far as he might, Storri had taught
himself , ; contompt"; for ; Richard. \u25a0 This
was net the simplest- task; it is hard
to despise one , whom your heart "fears
and before whose glance your own eyes
wavor and give;way. Still, Storri got
on -with his contempt beyond what one
might have -rnagined. He considered
all Americans beneath him, and Rich
ard was an American. There he had
\u25a0an advantage at the start. Also, Rich
ard was of the newspapers. Even,
those Americans about him, with their
own sneers and shoulder-shrugs, showed
him how such folk were unworthy genteel
countenance. They looked down upon
Richard, Storri loJked flown upon them;
the greater Included the less, and deduc
tions wf-re_Â£3S}\ : Storri. arrived. at a most
happy contempt of Richard as a math
ematician,gets to the solution of a prob
lem, and,"? being mercurial, J not /thought
ful, arranged with himselt that Richard
was below consideration.
Richard 'and- Storri made no sign of
social recognition when their. paths cross
ed by change. At such times the latter
held an attitude of staring superiorityâ
the fellow, perhaps, to. that which be
longed with Captain Cook .when first he
saw the, Sandwich Islanders. ' Had Storri
been of reflective, turn: he might : have
remembered that, as a gustatory finale,
those serene Islanders -roasted the mari
ner.'and made their dinner off him. .
Mr. Harley was a busy man, and yet.
he had no office, rooms; . This was not his
fault; he. had once set-out to establish
himself with such a theater of /effort,
but Senator Hanway. put down his foot.

his % powers vto charm. He had/ studied

a : girl's . heart./hlsjirst.^ approaches*, were
modeled on- the ; free and jovial. V During"

laughed loudly," and ' by. his manner would I

near to tear's as He 'related the Imaginarj
sickness of a mother whom he had in
vented for the. purpose. Dorothy's coo!
reserve continued. ' She sympathised, con
versatlonally. and hoped that Storri woulc
hurry to his expiring parent's side.- -
: Storri. like Richard, craved a rose anc
got it; but he fastened It upon his lape
himself.
On Storri's fourth call Bess Marklir
came in. Being there. Bess took Storr:
to herself. She betrayed a surprising in
terest in statisticsâ the populations oi
cities, crops, politics and every othei
"form of European whatnot-rand kepi
Storri answering questions llke^ta school
boy. Thereafter, Storri was no sooner ir
the Harley house when, presto! fronc
over tne way- our pythoness sweeps in.
Bess' was there before the servant had
taken Storrl's hat. This disturbing for
tune depressed him; he attributed it to U!
luck, 'never once observing that the in
stant he appeared Dorothy's black maid
skipped across to summon Bess.
"Really, Bess," rleaded Dorothy, fol
lowing Storri's fourth callâ she had gonÂ«
to tile Markllns just a.*er her admirei
leftâ "really, Bess, if you love me, rescue
me. There was never such a bore! Posi
tively, the creature will send me' to my
grave! ; And, besides" â with a little
shiverâ '-'I have a horror of the man!*' .
And so the good Bess came each time,
and faithfully refused to budge for the
whole of Storri's visit. With that, the
latter saw less and less reason to confer
with Mr. tiarley of an afternoon: also
he resolved upon a change of tactics in
his', siege of Dorothy.
' Thus far Storri hau failed, and the fail
ure set Â»~m on fire. The savage in him
was stirred. His vanity found itself de
.tied; and the onyx eyes would burn, and
the mustaches twist like snakes, as ho
reflected on how ne had been foiled and
put aside. Had he known that Richard
was In Dorothy's thought, that it was he
to hold her heart against him. Storri
would have choked. But he had gathered
no such knowledge; nor was he posted as
to those morning love trysts at winch
Senator Hanway unconsciously presided.
Storri still visited the Harley house, but
his visits were now to Mrs. Hanway-Har
ley. And he would pour compliments for
.that shallow lady, which said compli
ments our s Jlow one drank in like
water from the well. Mrs. Hanway-Har
ley had never known a more finished gen
tleman; and so she told her friends.
"It is a \u25a0 pity," cried Storri one day,
"that Europe has- none such as yourself
to set examples of refinement! Now if
your beautiful daughter would but make
some nobleman happy as his wife! You
would come to Europe, no?" and Storri
spread his hands' in rapture over so much
possible good fortune. "Yes. if your
lovely daughter would but condescend!"
Storri paused, and sighed a sigh of
power.
Mrs. Hanway-Harley thought this ex
ceeding fine; the treacle of coarse compli
ment sweetened it to her lips. Some
would have laughed at such fustian. Mrs.
Hanway-Harley was none of these: the
compliment she laughed at must emanate
from some one not a Count. None the
less, ' she could see that something was
at the^back of it aIL There was Storrl's
sigh as though a heart had broken. Had
Storri made some soft advance. -and had
Dorothy repulsed him? -Mrs. Hanway-
Harley could have shaken the girl!
Storri read all this my Mrs. Hanway-
Harley'js face as though it had been writ
ten upon paper. He saw that the mother
would be his ally; Mrs. Hanway-Harley
was ready to enlist upon his side. There
upon. Storri drew himself together with
dignity.
"In my own land, madam." said Storri.
conveying the impnsslon of a limitless
deference for* Mrs. Hanway-Harley, **it
is not permitted that a gentleman pay his
addresses to the dv. Jghter until he has
her - mother's consent. I adore your
daughterâ who xould help!â but I cannot
tell her unless you approve. And so. ma
dam," with a deepest of bows, "I, who
am a Russian gentleman, come to you."
Mrs. Hanway-Harley was not so sin
uously adroit as her brother. Senator
Han- -'-. but she was capable of every
conventional arL If Storri's declaration
stirred her Dride. she never showed- It:
if her soul exulted at a title in her fam
ily and a probable presentation of herself
to royalty, she con.raled it. True, she
was i .cllned to tilt I r nose a vulgar
bit; but she did not let Storri perceive
it. reserving the nose-tilting for ladies
of, hÂ«r acquafcuar.ee whÂ«n the betrothal
of Dorothy and Storri should be an
nounced. Indeed, her conduct, on the hon
orable occasion of Storri's request, could
not have been more graceful nor more
guarded. She said that she was honored
by. Storri's proposal, and touched by his
delicacy In first coming to her. She
could do no more, -however, than grant
him the permission craved, and secure to
him her best wishes.
"For, much as I love -my daughter,"
explained Mrs. Hanway-Harley, mount
ing a â¢ maternal \u25a0 pedestal and posing. "I
could not think of coercing her choice.
She will marry where she loves." A sigh
at this period. "I can only say 'that,
should she love where you desire, it can
not fail to engage my full approval." "
Storri pressed his lips to Mrs. Hanway-
Harley's hand as well as'he could for the
interfering crust of â¢ diamonds, and said
she hud made him happy.
.- "It will be bliss, madam, to call my
self your daughter's husband," said Stor
ri; "but it will be highest honor to find
myself your son."
Storri did not tell Mrs. Hanway-Harley
of "those afternoon calls, and the blight
of Bess to fall upon them with her eter
nal crops and politics and' populations.
Mrs. - Hanway-Harley, while she griev
ously suspected from Storrl's sighâ
which little whisper of despair still sound
ed in. her ears â tbat he had met reverses,
would not voice her surmise. She would
treat the affair as commencing with Stor
ri's request. But she would watch Dor
othy;, and if she detected symptoms of
failure to appreciate Storri as a noble
man possessing wealth and station â In
short, if Dorothy betrayed an intention
to refuse his cxatted handâ then she, Mrs.
Hanway-Harley. w.uld interfere. She
would take 'L.orothy in solemn charge,
2nd compel thai obtuse ma'rlen to do what
redounded to her ;.ood. Mrs. Hanway-
Harley doubted neither the propriety nor
the 5 feasibility of establishing a censor
ship over Dorothy's heart, should tho
>-oung . lady evinc - a blinded Inability to
see her own welfare."
"That is what a mother Is for," she
ruminated.
Mrs. Hanway-Harley had forcibly ad
ministered paregoric In Dorothy's baby
hood; she was ready to forcibly adminla-'
ter a husband now Dorothy had grown
up. The cases were in precise parallel,
md never the ray of distrust entered Mrs.
Flanway-Harley's . mindJ/" Dorothy was
not to escape good fortune merely.be
cause.' through some perversity of "girlish
Ignorance, she might choose to waive It
islde. . .
Airs. Hanway-Harley "had Mr. * X Harley
isk'Storrl-to dinner, on an average. twice
i wpek;'she made these slender banquets
wholly informal, Â»nd quite â¢ as though
Storri were an Intimate family friend.
Storri. commended the absence of stilts,
this abandonment of the conventional.
"It is what I like r" he cried; "it is the
compliment" I, shall most speak' ot when
[am back* with my Czar."
â¢ Following dinner, "â¢ Mrs. . Hanway-Harley "would have Storri in ttje library In en
gagingly familiar fashion.
Senator Hanwa-r went always to his
study after dinner,' to receive visitors
through the veranda door, and prune and
train the vine of ttis" Presidential hopes
with confabs and new plans. Into which
he and these visitorsâ who were folk of
power In their home Statesâ unreservedly
plunged. Mr. Hai'ev, whD was not domes
tic and feared nothlni,' so much ua aa
evening at home, would give an excuse
more or less feeble and go abroad Into the
town. This left Mrs. Hanway-Har.'ey, Dor
othy and Storri 'to themselves; and the
maternal ally saw to it that the noble
lover was granted chance to press his
suit. That Is to sÂ»y, Mrs Hanway-Har
ley gave Storri a chance so far as lay in
her accommo'latiniT oovor; for she de
veloped an inexhaustible roll of reasons
for leaving the room, and In her kind
sagacity never tailed to stay awoy at
least five minutes. nd a world and all
of love may be made in five minutes,
when both part.es set their hearts and
souls to the dulcet enterprise.
Storri was ardent, and Mrs. Hanway-
Harlcy was discreet, and both displayed
talents for Intrigue and execution that,
on omer days, in other fields, might well
have saved a state. And yet there was
no blushing progress to the love-making.
Dorot.ij s behavior was unaccountable.
The first evening she sat In marble sl
lenco, like an lma;e. The ' next, she
would not come down to dinner, saying
she was sick and could not eat. The in
valid put in a most successful evening in
her room, vhinkhig <f Richard, and sag
ing on miscellaneous dishes which her
sable *~ald abstracted from below. She
would have been ill the third time, but
her mother set her face like flint against
such excuse. Mrs. Hanway-Harley de
clared that Dorothy's desertion was dis
graceful at a moment when she, her
mother, needed her help to entertain
their visitor. With that, Dorothy's in
disposition yielded, and she so far re
covered as to p!ay her part at table with
commendable spirit, eating quite as much
as her mother, who was no one to dine
like a bird. But Dorothy took her re
venge; she talked of nothing but Rich
ard, and the conversations on politics
which he and "Uncle Pat" indulged in
during those eleven-o'clock calls.
Storri glowered; more, he became aware
of Richard as the dally comrade of Doro
thy. Mrs. Hanway-Harley herself was
struck by some shadow of the truth; but
she got "no more than what Scotchmen
call a "glisk," and she gave the matter
no sufficient weight. 9 Later she clothed
it with more importance.
Mrs. Hanway-Harley. however, was
moved to reprove Dorothy from out the
wealth of her experiences.
"Child," said she, when Storri was gone,
"you should never try to entertain one
gentleman by telling him about another;
it only makes him furious."
"I didn't, mamma," said Dorothy, her
eyes innocently round.
"You did, only you failed to notice it,"
returned Mrs. Hanway-Harley. "After
this be more upon your guard."
"I will, mamma," replied Dorothy de
murely; but she was too sly to say
against what she should guard.
On the next Storri evening, Dorothy
returned to the old ruse. She set a lamp
in her chamber window, the effect of the
beacon being that Bess came across from
her house, as the clock scored eight and
one-half, and joined the Harley party.
It was nothing out of common for Bess
to do this; she and Dorothy had been
bosom friends since days when the two
wore their hair in pigtails and their
frocks to their knees. Bees came not only
that evening, but every Storri evening;
and whether or no she were a welcome,
at least she was a pertinacious visitor, for
she stayed unrelentingly until Storri, los
ing courage, went his way.
Storri bit his angry lip over Bess, for
he now began to read the argument oi
her advent. It was Dorothy's defense
against him, and in its kind an insult.
Mrs. Hanway-Harley also became more
and more instructed in this love-match
so near her heart, and those difficulties
which the capricious coldness of Dorothy
arranged for its discouragement. The
pfacidity of Mrs. Hanway-Harley was
becoming ruffled; the hour was drawing
on apace when she would make clear her
position. She would issue those com
mands which were to fix the attitude of
Dorothy toward the sighing Storri and
his love.
Dorothy called Bess her guardian angei.
The G. A. accepted the position and its
duties with that admirable composure
which you have already observed was
among her characteristics. The fair Bess
was one of those whom their friends,
without intending offense, describe as
mildly eccentric. That is to say, Bess
had peculiarities which were in part na
tive and in part the work of an environ
ment. She was an only child, and that
was bad; she was a doctor's child, and
that was worse. Not that her father had
been so recklessly dense as to try his
drugs on her; he knew too much lor that.
But your doctor's children oft get an
unusual bringing up, and the chances in
favor of the extraordinary in that behalf
are doubled where there is only one child.
Mother Marklin had been an invalid
from the babyhood of Bess. Father
Marklin, in those intervals, when his
brougham was not racing from one lan
truld, dyspeptic, dance-tired, dinner
weary, rout-exhausted woman to an
other at ten dollars a drooping head, look
ed after Bess in that spirit of argus-eyed
solicitude with which a government looks
after its crown jewels. Bess was herded,
not to cay hived, and her childish days
were days of captivity. She was prisoner
to her father's loving apprehensions, he
being afraid to have her out of sight.
Then came her father's death, and the
Marklin household devolved upon Bess"
hands when the hands were new and
small and weak; and the load served to
emphasize Bess in divers ways. When not
waiting upon the invalid Mother Mark
lin, Bess broke Into her, father's book
shelves and read the owlish authors such
as Bacon and Dr. Johnson, . with side
flights Into Montaigne, Voltaire, Amiel
and others of hectic kidney. She discov
ered, moreover, a sympathy with those
women of strong minds who have a quar
rel with Providence for that they were
not made men. Bess believed in the equal
ity of the sexes, without pausing to ask
in what they were unequal, and stood
stoutly for the rights of woman, know
ing not wherein she was wronged or in
what manner and to what extent she
had been given the worst of life's bar
gain. Bess was not a blue-stocking, as
Richard would have had it. and made no
literary pretenses; but she suffered from
opinions concerning topics such as hus
band and wife, that so far had had noth
ing better than theory to rest upon. All
th<Â» same, her friends were deeply satis
fied with Bess; which helped that young
lady to a sense of satisfaction with her
self and with them.
'As head of the' Marklins. Bess was
made to decide things for herself.. At
that, she decided In favor of nothing ter
rifying. She drank tea between three
and six each afternoon; she kept a cat
named Ajax; and she resolved to marry
Mr. Fopling.
The latter young gentleman Bess called
to her side; when she. pleased," dismissed
when he wearied her, and in all respects
controlled his conclusions, his :conversa
tions, and his whereabouts, as .heaven
meant she should. Bess preferred that :
Mr. Fopling call during the afternoon;
she required the morning for. her house
hold duties., and, . when not . screening
Dorothy from Storri, saved the evening
for her books.
Ajax was a grave and fdrmal cat; and.
in his way, a personage. He was decor
ous to a degree, unbended in no confi
dences with stranger?, and ; hated .Mr.
Fopling:, whom he regarded as either a
graceless profligate or a domestic animal
of unsettled species who, though no merit
and by rank favoritism, had been granted
a place Jn the household superior to his
own. At sight of Mr. Fopling, Ajax
would bottle-brush his tail, arch his
back, and explode into that ejaculation
peculiar to cats. Mr. Fopling feared Ajax,
holding him to be rabid and not knowing
when he would do those rending deeds
of tooth and claw upon , him, of , which,
the ejaculation, the arched backhand the
bottle-brush were . signs and portents. .
It was, the afternoon of the day follow
ing one of thosq Harley dinners whereat
Storri had been the sole and honored
guest, and Bess was sipping her tea," Her
two favorites, Ajax and Mr.. Fopling,
were sitting in their respective chairs,
regarding each other with their usual sus
picion and distrust. Mr. Fopling, by,
command of Bess and so far as he might
control himself, was paying no attention
to Ajax. Ajax, for his part, was survey
ing Mr. Fopling with a sour stare, as
though he found much in that young
gentleman's appearance to criticize. At
intervals he made growling .comments
upon Mr. Fopling. -,
"Unless you and Ajax can agree," ob
served B?ss soberly, "one. or the other
might better go into the library."
Mr. Fopling made no demur; he was
glad to go.: When he was out of the room,
Ajax came and rubbed about his mistress
as though claiming credit for ousting Mr.
Fopling, cf whom he was certain Bess
thought as badly as did he.
Bess was sitting where she commanded
a prospect of the street. Who should
come swinging up the way but Richard.
It was tho habit of that rising journalist
to mnke one or two daily excursions pa""st'
the Harley house. Richard was none of
your, moon-mad ones who would strum a
midnight lute beneath a fair maid's win
dow. Still, he liked to walk by the Har
ley house; the temporary nearness of
Dorothy did his soul good. Besides, he
now and then caught a glimpse of her
through the window.
Richard was on the Marklin side of the
street, and as he was for going by
back to Bess and eyes on the Harley
houseâ Bess rapped on the pane and
berkoned him.'
Richard lifted his hat and obeyed di
rectly. He had already met Bess several
times when Dorothy and he,. with a pur
pose to spin out their eleven-o'clock in
terview, had seized on Bess as a method.
They could not remain^ staring at one an
other in Senator Hanway's study; even
that preoccupied publicist would have
been struck by the strangeness of such a
maneuver. The best, because the only,
thing was to make a pretext of Bess
and transfer their love-glances to . her
premises. This was the earliest time, how
ever, that Richard had been asked to
visit Bess alone, and he' confessed to a
feeling of curiosity, as he climbed the
steps, concerning the purpose of the sum
mons. -. . ' -
Bess some time before had had that
threatened talk with Richard concerning
marriage and husbands. . :
"Wedlock!" declared Bess, on that edi
fying occasion, while Richard grinned and
Dorothy rebuked him with a frown, "wed
lock results always in the . owner and
the ownedâ a slave and a despot. That: ls
by the wife's decree. The is
slave and she despot, or he the.' despot
and she the slave", as best matches with
her strength or weakness. Some* women
desire slavery; they would <\u25a0 be unhappy
without a tyrant to obey." -.
"And you â are you of those?" asked
Richard, half mocking Bess.
"No; I prefer the role of despot. It is
the reaspn why I shall marry Mr. Fop
ling."
"And yet Mr. Fopling might turn out
a perfect Caligula." said Richard, with
a vast pretense of warning. Mr. Fop
ling was not there to hear himself ill
used.
"Mr. Fopling-," observed Bess, in tones
of lofty â¢conviction, "has no ambitions,
no energies, .no thoughts; and he has
money. In brief, he is beset by none
of those causes that excite and drive
men into politics or literature or trade.
He will have nothing to consider in his
Hft; but me."
"But," said Richard, , "Mr. Fopling
might turn out in the end a veritable
Vesuvius. Mr. Fopling has often struck
me as volcanic; who shall say that he
will not some day erupt?" : â¢ "-
Bess was not to be frightened.
"Mr. Fopling will do and say and
think as I direct; and we shall be very,
very happy."
Richard gave Dorothy a comical look
of simuJated dismay; and shook his
head as though counseling against such
heresies.
"Of course," Bess continued, "what I
propose for Mr. Fopling would not do
for .you. Were you and I to marry"â
Dorothy started â "it would result in
civil war. I've no doubt that you will
be given a wife worthy your tyrannical
deserts. She will find her happiness in
sitting at your feet.' while her love â¢will
make you its trellis to climb and clam
ber on."
The conversation was not so foolishly
serious as it sounds, and ;for the most
part Bess and Richard were indulging
in just no more than so much verbal
sparring. Dorothy, took no side; those
questions of marriages and wives and
husbands would ever find" her tongue
tied if Richard were around." / . "
. "Will you have some tea?" asked
Bess, when Richard," in response to the
rapped window, made his way into her
presence.
No, Richard would not have tea.
"Then you may smoke," said Bess.
"That proves me your friend, doesn't it?"
as Richard! started a grateful , cloud.
"Now. to repay my friendship, I want
to ask a question and a favor."
"You shall!" cried Richard magnilo
quently. Bess and he, were. on amiable :
terms, and he was secretly assured that
the blonde pythoness approved j him.
"What am I to answer? What ami to
do? Has the. cherished Fopling gone
astray? Say'but the word,' and -I shall
hale him to your feet.'.' ."' * V
\u25a0 "Mr. Fopling. is In the library," re
plied Bess. "He and Ajax" coÂ«ld .not
get along without quarreling,' and "I
separated 1 them. The. question "md the
favor refer to Dorothy."
Richard colored.
"What Is; the question?" said he, his
"voice . turning deep and sof t. . .
' "Do.you' love her?" This "staggered
Richard. jÃess came- to his aid."' "I
know you do," said. she; "I'll answer the
query for;yo'. -The 'real question..!,
wanted to ask' is, Have you told her?
And that I'll answer: You have not." .
: "What does, this lead to?" broke in
Richard.; A half-ucore of daunting sur
mises had come up to shake ;him.V
"Don't you think you might . better
tell her?" continued Bess, not heeding
the question. ;' , "" . V ! '" -' '. ' '\u25a0' \u25a0

:.'Tve. no doubt you've '\u25a0 seen marvelous

Bp?s â¢In a matter-of-fact Vway; "but . I

."Frankly, yes,", replied Richard, driv
en desperate. "I hayef ; been on i. the
threshold of it, but somehow I couldn't
lay hands on just the words. Dorothy
Knows; I love | her!" he repeated "as
though to himself. "It would be only, a
formality." : \u0084 . ' \u25a0â¢ ' ;
"There 'is the. very point." observed
Bess. "It is the formality that has be
come important. '\u25a0\u25a0 Do you think I would
break In upon your dreams, else? A
formality is; a fence.-. If you.owned A
bed, of -flowers, would you build a fence
about it? Then fence in your Dorothy
'with a formal offer of your love."
"I shall not rest until ,I've done so!!
"cried Richard, catching flre.
then you will have done the wise
and safe and just and loving thing! Who
taught you to Ignore formalities? They
:are one's evidence of title. Build your
fence. It will be like saying to Storri:
So'far shalt thou come and no farther."
\u25a0. Bess looked curiously at Richard. She
hadmentioned Storriln a mood of mis
chief, aa one spurs a gamesome horse to
stir its mettle. Richard's brow was a
thundercloud. \
"Why do you name Storri with Doro
thy?âa serpent and a dove!" he said,
in tones very, slow and full.
"Dorothy will tell you," replied Bess.
"She will turn marvelously loquacious,
once she finds herself behind her; fence."
' "How shall -I go -to her?" exclaimed
Richard." "My 7 heart will be 'sick ;untll
I've told her."
"You will not have long to wait." said
Bess laughingly. "She should have been
here ten minutes ago. I can't see what
detains her."- '""" ' " *
Richard looked: bewildered and a little
shocked. "Surely,"- he began, "Dorothy
didn't â¢; v
. "No, no; you are not the victim of a
plot, Sir Suspicious One!" cried Bess.
"It is a vvonderthat you are not, for your
dullness surpasses belief. Do you imagine
Dorothy doesn't see you every time you
walk this street; that she hasn't seen' you
to-day? that she didn't see -you come in?
that " she won't invent some pretext ! for
running, over? Oh, foolish,' foolish bride
groom! You may guess how foolish by
peeping from : the window, for here your
Dorothy, comes." ''
At this, the benignant Bess, having
questioned, advised, admonished, and/ in
a measure, berated Richard, gave'lrimlher
hand as If she would give him courage;
and Richard, with the praiseworthy pur
pose of getting all the courage he. could,
lifted It to his lips. That was the blast
ing tableau at the moment Dorothy-stood
in the door.
"Oh!" 'cried Dorothy. Then her,' brow
crimsoned, and her eyes began to shine
like angry stars.

traveling miles and miles around, no
one knows how many, by. all kinds of
hesitating roads. I stopped him and
pointed cross-lou* to you. That is. my
whole offense; and when you arrived,
the: wanderer, in a 3plrit of gratitude
I entirely commend, was very properly
mumbling- over my hands."
Bess drew Dorothy into, the room.
"There!" cried she, "I have done my
utmost best for both. I shall now look
after Mr. Fopling. Poor child, he has
already been neglected too long!"
Bess, departing, left behind her two
young people wondrously embarrassed.
Richard had been plunged into a most
craven condition; while Dorothy, head
drooping like a flower gone to sleep,
the flush creeping from her browtoher
cheek, began to cry gently. Two large,
round, woeful tears came slowly into
the corners- of her eyes, paused a mo
ment; as though to' survey ; the : world,
and then" ran timidly down, one on
each : side ofher nose.
At this piteous sight, Richard became
a hero. Being an extremist in all
things! Richard, roused, caught Doro
thy to his bosomâ the first embrace
since that blessed boot-heel evening in
the Waldorf! He folded her in those
Pict arms inj most radical fashion, and
kissed herâ they were like unto
jjlimpses of heaven", those kisses!â
kissed her eyes, and her hair, and at
last her lips, measuring one kiss from
another with words of rapturous en
dearment, of which "heart's love" and
"darling" were' the most prudently cool.
Richard refused to free Dorothy from
out ' his, arms, not that she; struggled
bitterly, and'eontinued for full ten min
utes In theTutmost bliss and incoher
ency. " \u25a0 ~' ' *â¢
'At these unexpected pictures of Para
dise before the Fall, Ajax, sole specta
tor, felt profound dismay. He bottle
brushed and arched and exploded; and
then, the : wretched' exhibition" continu
ing:, fled. : .
At last Richp.ru listened to Dorothy,
and released her "to an armchair; he
took another, fastened his eyes .upbn
her like visual leeches, and drahkher
in. \u0084 .;â¢ \u25a0 .;\u25a0 ;
;: .."Who so "who so lovely,
who so glorious as Dorothy?'!, thought
Richard, on whom her beauty grew
with", ever-Increasing witchery, 1 like a
deep, dear night .of stars. ; '
"And â¢ yet, . the .\u25a0 dough-like Fopling, a t
that ' moment 'In the library.; with Bess,
would have foug-ht Richard to! the death
on a simple" jssue that Bess' was Doro

fromproving ! that love is Blind, shows
it to have. the. eyes of Argus.-,â .".."^ .
â¢; Richard and \u25a0 Dorothy, * said 'a. thousand

made a \u25a0 thousand lovingj compacts, , arid
kept them all."-" '.I' ".:\u25a0'*:' '. ''\u25a0:;. â¢.V:"." .
Suddenly Richard ' burst . forth :as
thcugh a impmentous ;. and usual cere
mony had-been, overlooked.
"Oh, . ho!", cried he,; "you haven't
asked \u25a0 how lam to support, a wlf e.">
\'"And'- do - you â¢ suppose M I have - been
thinkinc^of :that?" ; returned', Dorothy,
beginning; to: bridle. ' "For that matter,
I know \u25a0 you !are: poor." ' -
. "And how ; did,i-ou.dig- that up?" :; .;"
"Dig!" This withthe. utmost resent
ment,, as.'.though ; repelling-":a y slander.
"Why, you < told mamma and'"me-your
self. Itj.was the' dayshe. was'rude and
asked if Mr.. Gwynn would make you
his heir.".-- : ; : .-'.', -. ;
"Surely," said :Richard,. grinning
cheerfully, as if a-puzzle had been made
plain, "so; I: did.'-'
"Sweetheart, I loved, you from that
moment!", cried Dorothy; and with a
half-sob to be company for- the caress,
she drifted: about Richard's neck. V
."Nov.-, I should call ' poverty worth
while!" said Richard,' manfully- kissing
Dorothy all over again.'since she had
come within his clutch. Then, replac
ing her in her chair, the more readily
because he reflected â¢ that he might
easily repossess himself of her, he con
tinued "And the prospect of being a poor
man's wife ' does not alarm you, dar
ling?"
-Oh, Richard!" Then, looking him
squarely in the eyes "No, dear, it does
not alarm me."
Dorothy spoke truth. The prospect
of being a poor ;man's;"wlfe alarms no
woman â -before marriage.
Richard was in a whirl when he left
the Marklin door^ Bess fairly drove
him forth, or, he might not have depart
ed at all. The first shadows of night
were falling, but the whole world
seemed bright as noonday. He was
stricken of 'Vague surprise to observe
a man- running' by him, torch in hand,
lighting the street lamps. Controlling
his astonishment, Richard greeted the
man as though- they were old friends.
They were, not; old friends, -and the ef
fect of Richard's greeting was to lead
theiman of lamps to think him drunk.
"Got his load^early!" quoth ; the one
of lamps. He tippled himself, and was
versed in cup proprieties, which forbade
drunkenness prior -to 10 o'clock.
Richard, continued; down the street.
It was. as if he were .translated, and
had quitted earth to walk the clouds.
And to think that hot two hours before
he had come swinging along this iden
tical : thoroughfare, never dreaming of
the heaven of those loving arms : into
which . he,', was Walking! Blessed ..be
Bess!; He should never forget that sor
ceress,- .who to his weakness added her
strength, and^to his ignorance her wis
dom. It was", such an extraordinary
thing, now that Richard had time to
think of it, that Dorothy should love
jhini! And more amazing that she
should press her cheek to his and tell
him of it! Oh, he could still feel that
round, ; warm, "' velvet cheek against his
own!. It was smih a Joy to remember, too,
that it was, merely the beginning" of. an
eternity of- those soft endearments! -it
remade: the wprld; and all things, even
those most ; week-a-duy and common
place, came j upon him in colors so new
and strange \u25a0 and ""\u25a0rich"; and sweetâ
touched as they were with this trans
forming? light of Dorothy's love! Rich
ard plowed. through the winter evening
in a most -ridiculous frame 'of mind,
midway between transports - and Imbe
cility: .<â¢ â¢ "
"You will see me to-morrow?" plead
ed. Dorothy, as he came away.
'^'Whereat Richard averred doughtily
that he should.
Neither "of the' two having the prac
tical wit to settle hour or. place, Bess,
who the moment before had returned
to them from Mr. Fopling with intelli
gence coolly unimpaired, said:
"Four o'clock, then;. .'"and,- .if -I. may
make . a suggestion, you might better
meet here." -. -'..\u25a0\u25a0;'- ' I . ; T- \u25a0â¢'â¢."
It was among the miracles how the
high beatitude consequent .upon that
wonderful event of Dorothy's love put
Richard in a vaguely belligerent mood.
It was an amiable ferocity at that,. and
showed in nothing more. dire than just
an' eye .of -. overt challenge Vto ..-all"-- the
world. t[ Also," he dilated and swelled in
sheer masculine pride of himself, and
no longer .'.' walked \u25a0 the- streets, but
stalked. Naturalists will not be sur
prised by-these revelations, having ob
served kindred phenomena in the males
among' other species of animals.
In this lofty spirit, and by a fashion
of instinct, Richard headed for the club.
At. the club, by the best of fortune, as
he would have said in his thon temper,
he ; located -Storri: . and -thereupon he
bent .upon said patrician .such an iron
stare-.of confident, insolence that the
object of .'it was appreciably worried,
turning white, -then .red,, then white,
and In the 'finish leaving; the room,
unable to, sustain himself in- the face
of. so much triumph and truculence.
In the midst of this splendor of the
soul, and just as Richard had begun to
feel a catholic pity for all mankindto
think not one beyond himself was loved
by Dorothy, a message was thrust be
tween, his fingers. It. ran thus:
,;R. Storms, Washington. D.C.â What's
the matter? Where is your letter tOj
night? \:-'i_'L':'lf Daily Tory.
*It was like a cupful- of cold water,
souse! in Richard's face; it brought
him back to earth. In his successful
bright estate of love he had forgotten
about that letter. There was'no help
for it; 1 Richard got pen and blank, and
wired:
.Daily Tory, New York Cityâ Mr.
Storms is 111; no letter to-night.
: ..- L. GWYNN.
When this, was thirty minutes on its
way, Richard had. a further lucid inter
val.' With the power of prophecy upon
him.'he dispatched the following:
Dally Tory, New . York Cityâ Mr.
Storms will be ill a week.
L. GWYNN.
lUgave Richard a pang' to put aside
those - engaging letters, even for a
week. .Under the circumstances, how
ever,'arid-; with.a promise to sce'Doro
thy the next day -at-, \u25a0*. and a- purpose
to. see her'every day at 4. if she' per
mitted him, |he deemed it prudent to
send ;..' the second .message. Besides,
should' his reason, return before the
week's end, he could recover, from that
illness and take iip the letters again.
> Being something ; sobered now, Rich
ard, lighted a cigar and .strolled off
through a fall of snow. that had set, in,
thinking on Dorothy.' Arriving at : his
home, he, sat an hour; in rose;colored
reveries. .He : dived at; last " into tho

At 3 o'clock, with . the | soft fin gers . o f

'While. Richard had laid :> aside those
Daily. Tory letters for-a week, he would
still call on Senator Hanway at eleven.
He considered what ! an ; exquisite thrill
would go over him as he sat gazing on
Dorothyâ that new and beautiful posses
sion "of his heart.
Rather to Richard's dismay, Dorothy
was not with them that. morning in Sen
ator Hanway's' study. Had her love of
politics gone cooling? Senator Hanway
wa3 there, however, and uppermost in his
mind was something that would again
require countenance of the Anaconda
Airline, .^
" ..it^was the subtile policy, of Senator
Hanway, in his move toward a Presiden
cy, to seem to be standing still.. Hi 3 at
titude was feminine; the nomination must
abduct him: he must be dragged to the
altar and wedded into the White House
by force. In short," Senator Hanway was
for giving the country a noble exhibi
tion of the office -seeking the man.
This attitude of holding delicately aloof
did not prevent him in the privacy of his
study-^-out of which no secrets escaped â
from "unbuckling confidentially with'ones
who, like Richard, were close about his
coupsel ' board. It was not that he re
quired that young journalist's advice; but
he- needed his help, and so gave him his
confidence because he couldn't avoid it.
Richard. wore the honors of these con
fidences easily. Scores of times Senator
Hanway had gone into the detail of his
arrangements to trap delegates, where
fore it bred no surprise in him when,
upon this morning, that statesman took
up the question of an Anaconda Influence,
and the extent to which it might be ex
ercised. Senator Hanway showed Rich
ard a Hat of fourteen States, all subject
to the Anaconda's system of roads.
"In my opinion," said Senator Han
way, "the Anaconda could 'select the na
tional delegations in these States. There
Is no doubt that the fourteen, acting to
gether â for the list includes. three of tho
largest States in the country â would de
cide the nomination. The query Is. would
Mr. Gwynn be so amiably disposed! as to
move in the affair? I may say that I
should not prove insensible to so great a
favor."
"Mr. Gwynn," returned Richard, "has
repeatedly instructed me that you were
to regard the Anaconda as yours, and the
Daily Tory as yours, for everything that
either or both of them can d<* in your
interest. It will not be necessary to see
him unless you prefer an interview."
Senator Hanway never preferred an In
terview with anybody, where that for
mality was not demanded by the situa
tion. He held to the doctrine that no one,
not a fool, would talk beyond what was
necessary to carry his projects to suc
cess. His present word to Richard, how
ever, did not include this belief. â¢He put
it in this fashion:
"E do not feel at liberty," said he, "to
disturb Mr. Gwynn with what are no
more than just my personal concerns.
He has much more weighty matters of
his own to consider; and he ought not to
be loaded down with those of other men.
Besides, in this. instance, his magnificent
generosity has anticipated me. He tells
you that I am to have the assistance of
the Anlaconda."
"In what form and to what extent you
choose,", returned Richard. "He Â«:ven
said that, should you be set to head yout
party's ticket the campaign mightcount
upon the Anaconda for a contribution of
no less-.than a half million!"
Senator Hanway's pale face flushed, not
with gratitude, but exultation.
"I cannot tell you," said he, "which af
fects me most; Mr. Gwynn's immense
kindness or his even greater condescen
sion." ".
Then, getting to things practical, Sena
tor Hanway asked Richard if the presi
dent and general attorney of the Ana
conda might not - again be brought to
Washington.
"They- shall come," replied Richard con
fidently. "You have only to fix the
date."
"Any time between the second and
tenth of January," suggested Senator
Hanway. And that was settled. ,
Richard, not so much because of an
interestâ if truth were told his thoughts
went running away to Dorothy, and must
be continually yanked back by the ear to
topics common and earthlyâ but for the
sake of something to say, asked Senator
Hanway about the committee of three
selected; to Investigate Northern Consoli
dated.
â¢You know, the business came up be
cause of my letters In the Dally Tory,"
observed Richard, by way of excuse for
his curiosity.
The investigation was progressing slow
ly. It was secret; no part of the evi
dence could be given out. It would not
join with senatorial propriety to let any
thing be known for publication,
"tin a semi-judicial inquiry of this sort,"
explained Senator Hanway, "In tones of
patronizing dignity, "one of your discern
ment, wil! recognize the impropriety,
as well as .the absolute injustice, of
foreshadowing in any degree the
finding , of the committee. For
yourself, however, I don't mind saying
that the evidence, so far. is all in favor of
Northern Consolidated. The company
will emerge with a clean bill of health
clean as a whistle! The committee's find
ing," concluded Senator Hanway musing
ly, "will be like a new coat of paint to
the road. It should help it immenselyâ
help the stock; for these charges have
hung over Northern Consllidated values
like a shadow.'.'
"And when should the committee re
port?" queried Richard.
"Those things come along very leisure
ly; the report ought to be public, I should
think, about the middle of February. We
may give it to the road for a valentine,"
and Senator Hanway smiled in congratu
lation of himself, for something light and
fluffy, something to mark in him a pli
ancy of sentiment.
Senator Hanwayâ such is the .weakness
of the really greatâ had his vanity as well
as Richard, and would have been pleased
had folk thought him of a fancy that, on
occasion, could break away from those
more sodden commodities of, politics and
law-building. Caesar and Napoleon were
both unhappy until they had written
books, and Alexander . cared more for
Aristotle's good opinion than for con
quest.
Just when R .liard, who had been ex
pecting with every moment- his Dorothy
to come rustling in, was beginning to
despair, Dorothy's black maid appeared,
and, under pretense : of asking Senator
Hanway on behalf; of his "devoted niece
whether\or no said niece might count on
his-escoft to the; White House reception
New, Year's day, craftily slipped Richard
a note, r â¢ .-. \u25a0â¢â¢.*,.\u25a0
"Why, she. knoiys she may!'.'
Senator Hanway "was somewhat aston
ished at .Dorothy's forethoughtfulness;
the more since the reception was a week
and more away.
"Miss Dory .wants tq, have; Miss Bess,
from 'cross d* street, go 'long," vouch
safed the maid. :' - ' â¢' â¢
VOh. that's it!" said Senator Hanway,
who mistook, this for an [ explanation. '
Richard was on -nettles to' get ; !at Dor
othy's note. ; Anxiety, sharpened his facul
ties, \u25a0 and he took ; from his pocket a clip
ping, indeed a Dally ,Tory editorial
wherein was [ set forth ' what should 'tea
proper tariff policy, and gravely besought
Senator Hanway : f or j his views thereon.
While . that statesman was donning
glasses and running over the excerpt.
Richard made furtive shift to read his
note from Dorothy. It said: â¢
Dear:
I am with Bess. Something awful has
happened. Don't wait a moment, but
come. D.
Senator Hanway was not a little
amazed when, just as he found himself
midstream in those tariff studies to which
Richard had Invited him. that volatile in
dividual arose in the utmost excitement
and said that he must go.
"The truth is." said Richard, blunder
ing: about for the explanation which the
questioning eye of Senator Hanway ap
peared to ask. "I forgot a matter of Mr.
Gwynn's."
Senator Hanway waived his satisfied
hand In a manner that meant "Say no
more!" Senator Hanway did not doubt
that the business was Important. Any
business of Mr. Gwynn's must be im
portant. The sheer fact that it was Mr.
Gwynn's business made It important. It
bordered dangerously upon the criminal
that Richard should have neglected it.
The state of affairs described accounted
most satisfactorily for Richard's breath
less haste. Senator Hanway. when he
recalled the assurance of Mr. Harley.
made with bated breath But evening
before, that Mr. Gwynn's Income was
over twelve hundred thousand dollars a
month, sympathized with Richard's zeal.
Under rimllar circumstances Senator
Hanway's excitement would have mount
ed as high. It is such a privilege to
serve the very rich! -....*. ...*
Richard found Dorothy in that apart
ment which was but yesterday the thea
ter of his great happiness. She was
alone; for Bess must play the house
wife, and was at that moment addressing
a slattern maid upon the sin of dust in
some far-off. lofty corridor of the prem
ises. Richard swept Dorothy with a gray
glance like a flashlight. Her face was
troubled, but full of fortitude, and she
was very white about the mouth. At
sight of Richard, however. Dorothy's
fortitude gave way, and went whirling
downstream, in a tempest of tears and
sebs. With her poor hands outstretched
as if for protection, she felt her way
blindly . into the shelter of those arms;
and Richard drew her close and closer,
holding her to his heart as though she
were a child. He asked no question,
said no word, sure only as granite that,
whatever the trouble, it should not take
her from him. These rock-founded -na
tures, self-reliant, world-defying, made
all of love and iron, are. a mighty com
fort to weak ores: and so thought Doro
thy as she lay crying in Richard's em
brace.
And now, since you have seen Dorothy
safe across the harbor-bar of her griefs,
and she lies landlocked in the sure haven
of, the Pict arms, you might cross the
way for a space, and iearn what abode
at the foot of all thla disturbance of true
lovers. t
It was while Richard was closeted with
Senator Hanway that the storm broke.
Mrs. Hanway-Harley, after reflection,
had decided to speak to her daughter
upon the subject. of Storri and that noble
Russian's suit. To this end, Mrs. Hanway-
Harley called Dorothy into a little parlor
which opened off her bedchamber. It was
that particular apartment \u2666 where Mra.
Hanway-Harley took her naps, and after
ward donned war paint and feathers
wherewith to burst upon society.
Dorothy came reluctantly, haunted with
a forebode of impending griefs. The
room was a fashion of torture chamber
to Dorothy. Mrs. Hanway-Harley had
summoned her to this room for admoni
tion and reproach and punishment since
ever she was ten years of age. Where
fore, there was little iri her mother's call
to engage Dorothy pleasantly; and she
hung back, and answered slowly, with
soles of lead.
When Dorothy at last came in Mrs.
Hanway-Harley lost no time in skirmish
ing, but at once opened the main battle.
"My child." said she, with a look that
she meant should be ineffably affection
ate, and which was not. "Count Storri
has been talking of you."
"Yes?" queried Dorothy, with sinking
heart, but making a gallant effort at
childish innocence. #
Mrs. Hanway-Harley lost patience. She
observed and resented the childish Inno
cence, rebuking it smartly.
. "Rub that baby look out of your face,
instantly! You are not a child"'
Dorothy stiffened like a grenadier. She
remembered Richard: her mother was
right-; she was not a child, she was a
woman, and so the world should find her.
Dorothy's eyes began to gleam danger
ously, and if Mrs. Hanway-Harley had
owned any gift to read faces, she might
have hesitated at this pinch.
"What would you have done?" said Dor
othy, and her tones were as brittle and
as devoid of sentimental softness as Mrs.
"Marriage with Storri?"
"Dorothy," said Mrs. Hariway-Harley
with a sigh, softly returning to the lines
she had originally laid out. -Count Storri,
in the most delicate way. like the gentle
man and jiobleman he Is. has asked for
your hand."
Mr 3. Hanway-Harley had read some
thing like this in a magazine, and now
reeled It off with tender majesty. When
she spoke of Storri she had quite the
emx^ress air.
"For my hand!" said Dorothy, begin
ning to pant. -
Mrs. Hanway-Harley looked up: there
was a hardness In Dorothy's tone that
was not only new but unpleasant. Down
deep in her nature Dorothy hid those
stubborn traits that distinguished her re
ligious ancestor of the gate-post and the
water-pan.
"For your hand." repeated Mrs. Han
way-Harley uneasily, v;
Dorothy making uo return. Mrs. Han
way-Harley, after waiting a moment,
gave herself to a recount of these glowing
advantages promised by such a mar
riage. Was a nobleman, wealthy,
young, handsome, on terms of com
radeship with his Czar, to be refused?
Half the women in Washington were
wild for such an offer. It would place
the Harleys on a footing by them
selves.
"But I don't love him." urged Dor
othy, as though that had to do with
the question.
"At this foolishly unfortunate objec
tion Mrs. Hanway-Harley was ren
dered speechless. Then, as notice of
Dorothy's white, cold obstinacy began
to dawn : upon her, . she went suddenly
into lamentations. Vo think her child,
her only child, should deal her such a
blow! Mrs. Hanway-Harley called her
self the most ill-treated of parents.
She said her best and dearest feelings
had been trampled upon. In a shower
of tears and a cataract of complaint
she bemoaned her dark, ungrateful
destiny. At thlÂ» Dorothy's tears be
gan to flow and the Interview became
hysterical.
Mrs. Hanway-Harley was the earlier
to . recover* her balance. Drying her
eyes, she said:
"Disobedient child!" â this was also
from" the magazine â "since you will
hot listen to the voice of love. 3lnce
you will not listen to the voice of rea
son," you shall listen to the voice of
command."
(Continued Next Sunday. )How She saved the General
by the S, S. McClure Co.)
yES; I did save the general's life
saved it twice. Just let me tell you.
First, thfcre was paâ a perfect
prisoner!
I said, "Oh, my poor pa! Do you
think they will cut you In four pieces
end hang them over the gate posts and
horse rack, like King Edward done Sir
William Wallace. V
"Say did. Virginia. Oh. no. child; who
cares to murder an old. gray-headed
preacher like me? I am under guard;
that Is all. You poor little flltter-head
sparrow!"
Pa tried to smile, but be did not deceive
me In the least.
I knew he was held a prisoner of the
deepest, darkest dye â a prisoner of war
in his own very house. Yankees with
guns and weapons at both doors and pa
pacing up and down, backward and for
ward, vÂ© and down the long ha.ll with
that pitiful look on his face, like a bug
on a log and both ends burning, and
hands classed behind over his coat tails.
They let me run about, free as a house
cat. and I was excited. Me and Paul,
we're not afraid of any Yankees': I felt
brave and heroic, and I dared them (not
out loud) to slay me or chain me in
Irons:
I know a great deal from Paul's reading
so much. I hate books myself, Lut Paul
gloats on them and tells me the tales
till my head is stuffed full as an eg?
with schemes, stratagems and all sort?
of expedients.
Poor pa never pays the last *itention
to iii.-' advice, and is too good" ami poke
easy to make any effort for himself, or I
\u25a0would have whispered:
"Pa. make a sudden dash and butt the
\u2666entry off the back porch and escape,
f while I fly to the front door and lock it!"
Instead, 1 Just held his dear hand and
tried to amuse and cheer him up with a
t riddle.
"Pa," I said, "yard full, porch full,
can't get a dishfull" â meaning enemies,
of course, though the true answer is
smoke.
Pa never even heard me. He kept on
looking sorrowful. He darsn't get him
self a drink, so I brought him the
gourd, and his dear hand quivered till
he spilt the water. 1 began to feel
uneasy they would behead pa, so I hur
ried back to the porch to watch. I
made up my mind they should trample
over my dead body before they hit pa
a lick.

Ciiplured Firefly, Paul's colt. He and
1 had hid her in the old Mine Pit, back
of Hazel Spring, in the woods.
Whenever we heard talk of Yankees
coming, me and Paul hid our valuables
*>afe and sound. The woods back of
the spring is full of old pits where they
dug for gold about a thousand years
ago. There's mighty little in these old.

Our i>oor ma had been enjoying her
self up with the angels ever and ever
ssu long,, and pa, preaching every which
awa j , left me and Paul to raise our
eelves to suit ourselves â -we are twins.
The servants managed some sort of
â¢hackly way, but we all kept care of
pa and loved each other very dearly. ;
Paul is more honorable and toplofty
than me, but I have got a great deal the
Well, I sat in the porch corner and
watched. 1 knew one of the officers
was a general by his straps and but
tons skipping.
He looked very fiery and noble and
wrote notes occasionally, which splendid
couriers would take after saluting and
dash away galloping. There was not any
battle going on, but some kind of'a
1 know all about battles, and the lit
tle puffs of smoke now and then were
just to let folk know they were about,
I suppose. There was not nt-ar so much
uproar as our Colonel Carter had kicked
up when he camped on Racoon Branch
and Jet Paul have the skins from the
beeves.
And Unc' Black Dan made oa lovely
preaching boots out of Paul's skins, with
criers that would screech all the way
from the door to the pulpit, and Unc'
Danâ he could do anything. He made me
*nd Paul little cowskin shoes. Not very
preitj'. and stumpy, but comfortable.
And pa was always sending a servani*-
UÂ» "see what the children were doing and
. tell them to stop." Of course, me and j
Paul did not pay much attention to mes- \
sages, but when we heard those boots
come a-creaking we stopped. '
For we love him dearly and do not like '
to fret him.
* Well, this general was dressed in pis- (
tois and a gold-hilted sword, like Ex Cai
ibur.
When 1 tituugbt of pa's suffering I had
a great mind to snatch a pistol and clap
H to his fifth rib and exclaim:
"Die. Vandal!"
That's what Paul called them. "Van-
Oa:s and De?pot-hcels." Or, better still.
Id swirl the gold-hilted sword and with
rfne fell swoop send his proud head skip- ,
ninff nine ells into our front yard. ;
I didn't really snatch either, but my ,
arm Ehot out in a terrible manner, and 1
.hissed:
"Per-r-risb, tr-r-aitor!" :
I suppose I frightened the general, for \
he upset his ink, and cussed awful.
I ran and got our bottle me and Paul
had made out of elderberries and oak '
galls. It wrote lovely, but. was .very '
sticky.
The. general thanked me like any other
person, and bad such a kind, sweet smile <
I was glad I had not killed him. Â«'
He rummaged his pocket and gave me
EVELYN

a bunch of Ivory toothpicks that opened
like a little fan. and a knife. A knife
with two good blades and a corkscrew.
I never was so astonished.
"Thank you," I said. "I'll do you a
favor some day." \u2666
He smiled at ma again.
"X. mouse saved a lion's life," I said,
very dignified.
He dropped his notes on the porch floor
to dry. I pressed up to his shoulder to
see him write. \u25a0 .
It was my Ink, and I certainly had a
right.
"Can you read it, little rebÂ£l?" he
asked quizzically; for he was not a bit
in any hurry.
"No, sir," I answered; "but I expect
Paul can."
He wrote awful bad.
Just then a scheme flew into my head
to send one of these notes to our men
by Paul, for thÂ£ rescue of pa. Paul
says, "All is fair In love and war.' 1
So I brought a gourd of ice water to
the general, and he draint-o it and sa'.d:
"That 1b fine."
I dropped the empty gourd on purpose,
and picked up a note along with it.
Then I flew to find Paul, who was down
in the thickets abou? his trapi; and I
knew he was brooding scheme?, too, for
we both knew pa takes mighty poor
care of himself, and we look after him.""
He was on his knees and I thought in
great despair or at prayer.
,But Paul was scratching eggs out of
. the guinea nest. I flew at him.
"It's my nest," I cried.
"I found It!" he said.
"I watched the guinea, sir!"
"You watched the guinea rooster; you
can't tell them apart, miss!"
I sprang and pulled his hair. He
squirmed round and pulled mine, which
was cut short and exactly like his. We<
tussled and rolled and * scrambled till
every guinea egg was smashed. I could
not bogs Paul and he could not boss me,
for we were twins, and the very same
age.
Then we sat up and glared. I tore my
handkerchief and threw him half to mop
his bloody nose," and bound up my skint
wrist with the rest.
"Paul," I said, "I am perfectly ashamed
of ourselves. To waste ail this good
fighting -that might have slain a Yankee!"
"Virginia," sneered Paul, "you are not
such a great fighter. You can make a
fellow's nose bleed, and that's about ail."
"What's the matter with my flying a c
the big general's nose then, while you
stab his back in the fifth rib? "
"I'm too honerble!" said Paul haught
ily. "Stab even an enemy in the back
never!"
My conscience hurt me for planning the
death of that good, kind general. I felt
that I must have a mean heart.
"Paul," I said,' "you are noble. You
ought to go along with the Prince of
Whales and lvanhoe and Richard Cure
the-LÂ»ion."
That flattered. Paul, and he smiled.
Then I said eagerly: "The Job of rescu
ing our poor pa, pacing like aâ like a
wounded bison, would suit them exactly.
If we could only send word to them 1
know they would come with their vas
sals."
"Virginia, they are dead," said. Paul,
quite solemn. "You stem to get things
mixed half the time.",
He shook his head in great botherment.
"Your schemes are always flighty, Vir
ginia. You nearly killed me once. That
time you tied my aching tooth to the
string and an apple to the other end and
made the old sow run away wiÂ«h it."
But when I showed Paul th > dispatch
hls^yes glowed like lightning bugs.
"ft â¢Stonewall Jackson gets this, Vir
ginia, he'll come. I know he'll come. He
is out on the rampage now. Unc' Black
Dan cays so. He is here to-day and there
to-morrow; swift as a weaver's shuttle.
He is on the old Furnace road now' on the
rampage." ry
"How does I.'uc'V Black Dan know,
"He heard.it by ihe underground^ rail
road â last night."
"How?"
"Oh, that's what they call it. Don't
you know colored folk find out things
long beforehand ?''
"Paul, that Is perfectly sylendid. You
carry the dispatch, and tell General Jack
son I say our porch and yard are full of
Yankees." " .
"Why should 1 tell General Jackson you
say. Virginia? "
"Oh, well! Just tell him you say.
I'll run and get you a pass like Colonel
Carter gave, and you'll ride Firefly, and
I'll meet you with It at the old Mine
Pit."
WHEN the old philosopher ad
mitted that he was unable to
explain all the ramifications
and subtleties of the ways of
a man with a maid he con
fessed to a condition of Ignorance that
would have brought the blush of shame
to the cheek of any member in good
standing in the philosophers' unlcn. A
man who had lived as long as he did with
out finding out the solution to such a
simple problem might &ayÂ« been justified
in asfcuming that he had lived more or
less In vain. Of course there are many
men, and approximately as many maids,
and they all have different ways, but in
the last analysis they all proceed on the
same fundamental principles. It is with
the pious Intention of spreading a large
quantity of expert knowledge before the
world in general and particularly before
the aforesaid old philosopher anent, the
ways of men with maids that we proceed
to tell what happened to Alphonse and
Marie. . .
Marie was a coy maid and exceedingly
hard to keep in eight of. For more yeaif
than it would be polite or safe to mention
she had had a number of callow youths
trailing around after her. Alphonse being
among these tralleis. It was not that
Marie was fickle or that she. didn't know
her own mind. The. man who thinks that
a woman doesn't know her own mind is
possessed of a V3?t ; amount of high^class
ignorance of the sex.
The settled principle \u25a0by which Marie
regulated her conduct was that men
never value any article that'' is ; held too
cheaply. Therefore she proposed to give
a Ions: chase to the man who presumed
to entice hor into the matrimonial corral.
Furthermore, she argued, .matrimony is
an uncertain condition, .especially since
the South Dakota divorces.. have begun
to loss? caste. with the Supreme Coujt.
L-iberty Is sweet,' especially, .after "you
have lost it, and Marie didn't -hanker 1 : to
deprive herself of any of the sweets of
freedom until .she could make" a contract
that would guarantee her. all -the rights

was the! sentry, there was pa. "Lean
your head down, my poor pa," I said,
I hugged him tight and bade him
"cheer flip" and' "never despair" and
only trust; in me and Paul and the

It swung up on the , low porch and

no time for swapping knives.

soldiers halted me, called me "Johnny"
and "Reb," and by the time I reached the
spring I had showed my pass three times.
The fat Dutchman in charge of the
beeves said, "Dat vash all vreet!" ,'X
watched the man tor a while- FresewOr I
sapped away and dodged about in the
bushes till I was clean out of sight. Then
I fairly cut for the old Pit.
Paul was "waiting. He had gone a rotn-s^
about way by the dry ravine and over our
big arbutus patch. Firefly was ruboi~TÂ«
her nose on his shoulder and was very
glad to ace us.
We were ")oth pale and began to realize
somebody might get hurt. So many ene
mies lurked around who did not care at
all who they shot.
My heart beat with great bumps agaHwc
my side, and Paul's gray blousa fluttered
like a bird was in his bosom.
I handed him the pass.
"Oh, Paul." I sal<l. "does your courage
holdâ do yon dare?" SSi
"It does. I do. I do, Virginia, I'll never,
turn back!" He clasped his hands and
looked noble and solemn.
â¢""If the worst comes to the worst, Vir
ginia,'^ he said, trying to cheer me. "we
Kill join poor ma and the angels."
"Paul."' I said, "would you rather gO
enjoy yourself with ma* or scuffle it out
here?"
He answered sorter alow: 'â¢Wnat is good
enough for angels is plenty good enough
for me, but I don't see how you and pa
could" get on very well without me, Vir
ginia."
Firefly rubbed up between us, and we
all put our arms around one another's
necks. ; \'".
Paul said some of that piece we like io
well:
To every man upon the land
Death cometh soon or late,
How can man die better
Than facing fearful odds?
"What a little fellow you are. Paul," I
said, noticing it all at once.
"I was just thinking what a little, small
chap you are yourself. Virginia."
It was time now for me to ba hurrying
back, for I felt sure pa would get into
some mischief without me.
I told Paul. "Be sure not to catch cold,'*
and we kl?sed.
Then he climbed up in (he little saddle
pa had made for him Christmas, and I
sat on the stump and watched him and
Firefly trotting away through tha pines
and dogwood bushes, and realized he
was Just a little boy.
That was the last I saw of Paul for a
long, long time. -
The fat German eyed me very keen as
I came ' back. I put my hands In my
pockets and whistled to let him know I
was a boy.
I was terribly afraid he would call for
that pass again, but he did not.
He pointed to a bloody hide and said.
"Dere ish your skin, leetle poy!"
Andâ oh-h! it was the skin of my own
little Spotty heifer!
I burst out crying. "You are- a thief!
I'll report you! I'll tell the general. Oh!
my dear calf I raised myself!"
It does hurt anybody so awful to kill
their heifer they raised themselves.
I drew her little front paws over my
shoulder and dragged her skin sadly
along.
I could not stop crying about Spotty,
and dragged her poor skin halfway home,
without being bothered, till In the edge
of the thickets there came a puff of
smoke, and my left arm stung 1 and
dropped the skin, and I began to hurt all
over.
I had on Paul's coonskin cap and some
body must have taken me for a varmint.
When I got near the house I felt very
curious. I walked sorter onesided-
A soldier came to meet me and pulled
me along roughly.
"You pitiful little rascal!" he said.
"Come and report your deviltry! Dressed
up as a boy. are you?" Bs*9Â§e
Just as I expected. No sooner was my
back turned than poor pa got In trouble.
With his back against the bell-pear tree.
stood pa, trembly as a ghost, between, a
line of soldiers, who stood at 'tentlon.
The general was leaning against the
white porch pillar and the officers stood
near.
â¢ I do believe they were having a court
martial off my poor pa.
Just then I staggered into rlaw. for 1
was in great pain.
Pa exclaimed: "Oh, Virginia, Virginia,
have you come- at last?" . ';. X'
I clasped my hands to the general and
cried out:
"Oh, do not shoot my pa! HÂ» Is Inno
cent as you. I took the note. Shoot ma.
I am the guilty oneâ l!**
Then I toppled over and did no* know
anything more at all.
Wow I hayÂ« to tell the tals as pa told
it later.
The general stooped down to lift ms ujy
and said: t
"Poor little rebel! Poor Uttls- kid!"
At that moment a riflo ball tore a hols
through the pillar wh-re tho general's
head rested the Instant before. He ex
claimed:
"My God! The kid has saved my Ufe!"
More bullets cams flying out from tho
thickets; then a volley. Pa said It was
pandemonium let loose. The rebel yell
reverberated through the thickets.
"Yl-yi-yeli-yl! Yi-yee-I-U!" and all in a
moment, like a swarm of bees, there were
thousands of gray jackets.
Our premises were cleared of tha enemy
-in a twinkling. The peach orchard. In
full bloom that morning, had not a blos
som left the next day. The trees were
stripped of their branches by shot and
shell.
Pa says "the battle was fought glor
iously and we won the field."
My pass did not do Paul a bit of good.
-Before he had gone a mils. a soldier
halted him. but Firefly did not stop
i quick enough. Poor Firefly always would
1 manage Paul, and so she was shot and
' rolled on him.
i He was mashed some, but the soldier
i did not bother him when he saw what
1 a small chap Paul was. So Paul limped
| along till he met one of -Jackson's
, scouts and he carried him to Jackson.
. And Paul gave him the note and told
him what I told him to tell him about
' our porch and yard full of Yankees.
Paul stayed in the camp "hospital till
he got patched up and they sent him
home. They praised him up, too. But
nobody praised me at 'all. They said I
came within the ace of spades of being
thÂ» death of both pa and Paul with
meddlesomeness.
Nobody gave me any horse or any
thing, except my dear, kind, sweet,
good general.
How glad I am I saved his life. Saved
it twice. First by. not 'killing: him with
his own pistol and then when I fainted
and made him si 'op over to pick me up.
just in time to dodge the mlnie ball
aimed at his head.

1 Parsee. I'd never been' low
enough down to. sign on under
* black man ,before, but I guess I was
past being very nice in my tastes just
then. The. owner, was fat and x>ldish, and
wore a thing en his head like a top. hat
turned upside down, and I will, say^ that
I fiid not give hjm much politeness. But
he knew his place; he sahib'd me Quite
respectfully, and he f aid he'd be honored
if I'd take his steamer under my charge.
'She was all he'd got,' he said; 'he'loved
her like his life, and he'd jiot tiuSt her
to any one except a pukka sahib.* . \
"Of course, he lied a good deal â all na
tlvei do thatâ and he fixed up our bargain
sc that I'd little to v.in and he'd a good
deal, which is tlu.se Parsees' way. But I
trill say he was always most respectful,
and in the matter of victualing he really
surprised me. "Why. he actually put Bass'
air on board at four annas the bottle! â¢
"We cleared from Bombay in corn and
cottons and earthenware consigned to
Jeddah, and the owner told me I'd have
no trouble in getting a cargo of dates and
coffee â¢to bring back. But the Jeddah
merchants seemed to think different. 1
cut down freights to near vanishing point,
but they wouldn't look at them anyhow.
I couldn't get a â¢ ton of cargo on board
for any spot on the known globe â no, not
if I'd offer to carry it for nothing. The
S&lgon might have swung there at moor
ings till the bottom rotted out of her, and
expenses were running up all the time.
"The climate was eickly, too; I lost my
rerang before I'd been there a week, and
two more of the coolies died in the next
ten days. So when this cargo of pilgrims
offered, I tell you I just jumped at It.
Of course, this old wreck was not fitted
for the trade. She's small, she's iron
decks, she's only two boats and she's
not near enough water tanks. \u25a0 There'd be
big penalties if she was caught. But ' I
shipped a second rice steamer and sighed
tfcat charter party smiling.
"It wasn't as if I'd go to go through
the ditch to one of the Morocco port*;
the pilgrims had only to be taken across
to Kosseir; and squaring an Egyptian
custom officer is only a case of how ra-ch
backs hlsh."
"You do know your trade," said Cor
tolvin.
"The under side of it," "said Kettle, with
a sigh. "A man with luck like mine has
to. He pever gets on with the decent
Eteamboat lines, where everything is
square and above-board.' He can only
get the little hole-and-corner owners,
who you've got to make dividends for
somehow "and no questions asked, or else
just up and take the dirty sack." "
i'm a man," he added with a. frown,
"that can do the job well, and they
know it, and keep me to' it. But I de
epise" myself all the time ' It isn't in
my nature, Mr. Cortolvin. Put me

"There's no' accounting for â¢ taste,
captain.- I'm the owner of acres near
Hicbmond, and if 1 chose I could ride
about -my park -and sc-e the farms, and
live the life of -a country gentleman,
just in" the v.-ay; you think you'd like.
But I tired of it."
"Perhaps you have no wife, s!r," sug
gested the sailor.
His guest gave a "short laugh.
*'O, Lord, yes,"' be said. "I've a wife. '
He paused a minute -and then threw
his- half-smoked cheroot savagely out
into the sunshine.
t*'You can take it from me that fve
wife, captain. But â well you see, I've,
always been an Arabic scholar, and I
thought I'd come out to the Hedjaz .to
study' dialects' for a yesr -or so. It
\u25a0would be a pleasant change after- the

that's any satisfaction. If I choise to go
home now, I could pose as no end of a

1 can't quite make up my mind to risk
it. By God, yee," he added, with a
fciare out into the baking sunshine be
yond the doorway, "O. yes, I'v*s a wife."
Captain Kettle did not quite follow
all this, so he said pol'tely and vaguely,
"Well, of course, you know your own
affairs best, sir." Then he took a long
and steady look at his '.guest. "You'll
excuse me, eir, but your name seems
familiar.- I wonder if you'd got *that
beard and some of your hair oft wheth
â I bhould recognise you."
â¢I tancy not."
"Cortolvin," the little man mused.
"I'm sure. I've seen that name before
somewhere.**
The Hadji laughed. "I'm afraid that
neither I nor any of my people have
been celebrated enough to have come
into public notice, skipper; but we Uad
a namesake some years back who was
famou*. A horse named Cortolvin won
the grand national in '67. That's what
jou'll have grot in your mind."
Captain Kettle stiffened. "I beg jour

The pair of . thcrh went outside ' th=

pipe, with the joints all greasy with
white lead, lay on the deck planks, and
the second engineer stood beside it with
thumbs in his wa:st strap. On the deck
below, the i>ilgrims no longer squatted
on their carpets, but stood together |n
knots, and talked excitedly. Cortolvin
clapped his hands, and the sea of savage
fac<s turned toward him.
There v.ero iei>resentatlvea in that mob
from 'half .the Mahometan peoples of
Northern Africa. There were lean Arab
camel breeders of the desert, jet black
farmers from the Great Lakes and the
upper 'Nile. Hausas from the Western
Suudan.'limp Fellaheen from lower Egypt
and Kgba who had served on the British
police force at Lagos, merchants from the
back of thc.Barbary states, workers In
metal from . Sokoto. and weavers from
Tlmbukhtu. -J,
They v.nre not all holders of the title
of Hadji; for though by the Mahometan
Maw every male must make the Mecca'
pilgrimage at least once in a lifetime,'
unless debarred by" poverty or lameness. <
the journey maybe done by deputy. And
these deputies, fierce, truculent ruffians,
who had lived their lives among. incessant
wars and travel, were perhaps the most,
dangerous of zXV the lot.
"The black men listened to their late
associate with a momentary hush of sur
prise. He spoke to them in fluent Arabic.
He did not appeal to their better \u25a0 feel
ings; he knew his audience. He said it.
wa? written that If they tried this thing. â¢
if t^iey attempted to capture the steamer.
thÂ«iy should; surely fail; that all things

that- a horrible death awaited those who

\u25a0And then he tried to point out the na-
of: the Saigon's" defenses* ,but there
.he failed. ,It is. ill work to explain the
properties of .high pressure steim to sav
ages. A murmur arose .among them

\u25a0 ladder.*<iÂ§?li^9qHPQÃPVÂ£B9!9Â«99

?ach sriroy hanu, and lifted the Iron
pipe.* It was. well jointed and moved
ta^ily, and he turned the nczz.e of It ti>
sweep the ladder. In that Ixtkinâ¢ air th*
stcu.ni did nut â¢ condense readily; it
traveled three yards from the nozzle of
the pipe before it became even thinly
visible, and it. impinged upon the black
naked bodies ami uurued horribly wita
uut being seen.

And in the meantime others of the pil
grims wc:e try ins to storm the bridge
deck at other points; but on the port
side the gray-headed old man fighting
baresark with an ax. and to starboaxd.
Captain Kettle with pistol and knuckle
duster, battled like \vildcat3 to keep tha
-acred planking inviolate.
What was going on at the after end of
the Saigon they could not telL. From
behind thtm came the roar of the fight
ing Hausa and the savage war cries of
the desert, jtfs: as they rose up from
before their faces. But in its first flush
the fight was too close for any man's
thoughts to wander from his own im
mediate adversaries.
It seemed, however, that the battle wa
over first in the after part of the
steamer, and whether this was because
the attack there was less heartful. or be
cause Mr. MeT odd's artillery was more
terrible, cannot now be known. The
question was debated much afterward
without coming to a decision. But, any
way, by the time Captain Kettle* ad
versaries had ceased to rage against him.
Cortolvin was free to come and stand by
his side as interpreter.
The wounded lay sprawling and writh
ing about the iron decks; below them the
survivorsâ and scarcely one of these wma
without his. scaldâ huddled against thÂ»
doors of the forecastle; and the grimy
second engineer held the belching Â»ts*m
pipe upward, so that a gray, pall hung
between the Saigon and the sun.
"Now. sir." said Kettle, "kindly trans
late for me. Tell those animals to chuck
all their hardware over the side or I*U
cook the whole lot of them like so many*
sausages."
Cortolvin lifted up his voice tn â¢one
rous Arabic.
"It was written," he cried, "that thÂ«
giaour should prevail. It Is written Â«JÂ«O
that those amongst you having wit shall
"csst your weapons into the sea. It Is
written, moreover, that those others of
you who do not on this instant disarm
"shall taste again of the scorching breath
of Ehlin."
A stream of weapons" leapt up through
th? air and fell into the swells alongside
.with tinkling splashes.
. it would be a weariness to guard
you." Cortolvin went on. "Swear by the
beard of the prophet to make no further
attempt against this ship, or we shall
jail you last In death."
'A' forest of trembling black hands shot
up before him.
. "We swear!" they cried.
"Then it is written that you keep your
vow." said Cortolvin. "God is great!
See now to your sick." He turned to
Kettle and touched his ragged turban,
alter the manner of an o~*cer reporting.
"The mutiny is ended, sir," he said.
Captain Kettle swung himself lightly on
to the upper bridge and telegraphed
."Full speed ahead" to the englno room;
the propeller splashed In the oily swells,
and the Saigon gathered way. Sullen ami
trembling, the pilgrims began to tend
their hurts, and presently McTodd with
a large copper kettle In his hand de
scended among them, and distributed oil
and surgical advice.
â¢ 'There were none actually killed at my
end," said Cortolvin. J< .
"I dropped four." said Kettle. "I had
to. It was either me or them. And my
old mate axed half a dozen before they
let him be. We'd a tight time here while
It lasted."
"It will require a good lump of back
shlsh to explain it all satisfactorily at
Kosseir."
"Oh, I can't go near there now after
this. No custom-house for me. sir. : I
shall just run inshcre a dozen miles
short of it. ami out the beggars on the
beach in my boats, and let them get into
Kosseir as best they can. I suppose
you'll come back with me?"
"I suppose so. Anyway. I can't go on
â¢ with them. It is the first time any of
them have discovered I was not a gen
uine Arab."
"I can imagine." said Kettle, dryly,
"they'd give you a lively time. If they
had you to themselves for live minutes.
The sons of the prophet don't admirs
having Europeans messing about the
Kaaba. But I owe you something, sir.
and I shall be happy to go out of my
way^ to - serve j^ou. I will drop, you at
Suakim. or at Aden, or at Perlm. where
J am soinsr to coa!. whichever you please."
. VBut what about yourself?"
"Oh. I shall be all right. I am seldom
in need of a nursery maid, sir."
"But if this affair gets into the news
papers, inquiries will be made, and you'll
very possibly find yourself In an ugly
hole."
"It won't get in the newspapers," said
Kettle, thoughtfully. "The pilgrims can't
tell.', my officers daren't for their own
sake*, and you leave me to see my coolies
don't. Newspapers." he repeated dream
ily; "queer the hint should have coma
like that."
"What hint? What are you talking

"I remembered then *here I'd seen

"Whnt.waa said?"
".Well. jjlr. I suppose you'd better b*
told. But you must hold up for a hardish
knock. V.'ill you come Jnto the chart

. ,"No: get along, man. get along."
"I think !t was about your wife, sir.

"All the ; stcscn."

i Ccrtolvin cfrttrheU at the white rail of

"It was only a two-line paragraph.
t "You'll please understand how sorry 1
i am" to carry such sad news, Mr. Cortol
3 vin."
,' . "Thanks, skipper, thanks." He turned
.â¢away and walked to the end of the brtd<e
I and stayed there for a while, leaning
\u0084 against an awning stanchion, and staring
; at the baklns leve'u of the Red Sea
t. which were slipping past the Sijgon's
rusty flanks. And then he came back
i again and stood at'Kett'e's sfdo. looking
â¢ down at the pilgrims anointing their
.-\u25a0 scalds below.
â¢ -"I have learned to be something* of *

I was written also that I'should live. \u25a0 God

"It's only natural," snys Mr, Ed
wards, parenthetically explaining' Mrs.
Edwards' enthusiasm and speaklng^out
of the fullness of- his o\yn heart, "that
you should think the place where
you've done well, v.-here you've been for-,
tunate and happy, the prettiest and best
pl.ice on earthâ and that's the v/ay we
feel about Tonopah. ' : _"*'-,.'
"Maybe," he hedges, '-there arn't very
many trees there â and a good deal, of
dust. Maybe things ARE a little
rougher than they nre down hero; but
we've been fortunate there, and happy,
and I guess no matter where we go
we'll always call Nevada 'home,' and
we'll always think Tonopah the best
place on earth." â¢. f.^ 'â¢
"And you know, Tom." supplements
Mri. Edwards, "that the new houses
there, those built of stone", are .as.
handsome as you'll see anywhere; and
you can get anything you want in

of Bleak Siberia
OUT of the bleakest wastes of Si
beria there haÂ« recently emerged
ii man that has tramped nearly
7000 iÃi!es, in a zigzag course,
through that vast stretch of Czar
Nicholas' domain. He "has met with
and combated all kinds of hardships,
fume of them worse than have been ex
perienced by the unfortunate political
ar.d criminal exiloF, that are forced to
make ihcir abode in that isolated por
tion of the world. At certain periods of
his long am! arduous journey ha
fraternized with these banished Rus
sians, whose conditions he studied: par
took of the meaner hospitality of the
natives of that !und; crossed on foot th 2
snow-clad Tsehauen mountains, a feat"
credited to no other white, man,-, and
finally reached the civilized world again
with a tale of adventures some of which
are thrilling in character.
llerr Oscar Iden-Zeller is the name of
this interesting traveler. He landed here
several days ago from Nome, where he
arrived on- September 2 from Eastern Si
beria. He is a journalist by profession,
a member of the staff of the Berlin
Tageblatt. a graduate of the Kaiser Wll
helm University and a traveler Ly pref
erence. His recent adventures in Russia
and Siberia were the outgrowth of his
detcnuinatlon to study tho^e great coun
tries.
Leaving Berlin on the morning of April
23, 1903, Iden-Zeller proceeded to Copen
hagen and thence by steamer to Stock
holm, from v.here he walked to Helsihg
fors, Finland, and on to St. Petersburg
and Moscow, arriving in the latter city in
October. I*j3. January of (.ha following
year found him in the Siberian towtruf
Bamara and by gradual stages he tramp
ed on to Tomsk. Irkutsk and Yakutsk.
It had been the original plan of Iden-
Zeller to 'cross the Russian domain to
Vladivostok and to also visit Tokro. but
the war compelled him to change his
route in the direction of Verschojansk,
at which, he arrived in October, VM. It
was there that the more arduous part
of his long journey was encountered, for
the country is wild and trackless and in
habited only by native tribes, principally
Yakutas, except at occasional mining
camps, where civilized people are to be
found. In December, 1901, Iden-Zeller,
footsore and hungry, arrived in Sredne*
Kolymsk, and three months later he was
resting in the Nijni-Kolymsk district,
where Pantleicha. a well known trading
center, ex'.sts. and where the annual fair
of the natives was In progress when he
reached there.
On leaving Pantleicha Iden-Zeller
turned his course toward the* lofty and
snow covered Tschauen mountains, across
which his journey with the hardest
of experiences lasted for 113 days. Early
in his difficult climb he lost his matches
and tobacco, while crossing a' river, and
nearfy lost his life by felling through a
crevice in the Ice. With no means of
building- ;i fire or drying his' clothes and
warming his half frozen body the intrepid
traveler was stricken down with a. severe
cold mid a fever and was crippled with
rheumatism. It wa3 while in this suffer
ing cuiiuiuon without proper nour
ishment he was found by a band of na
tives., who carried him off to a pli.ee of
dicker and carefulij- nursed bacK his
bUdlgtii.
On one occasion luen-ZelleV- encountered
a member cf the Jiust ian police, who' es
corted him to the next station "and
furnished t!ie traveler,. with*" food and
lretsh clothing. It was seldom, however,,
that be. enjoyed the society of any one
other than natives during those many
cays of terrible experiences and he was '
glad at times to .accept' from these In
habitants of the frozen country morsels
of bleeding raw iish that they obtained
from beneath the Ice coating of tha
streams.
Idcn-Ztller lays claim to the distinc
poa of being the lirst white man to cross
Ihuy Tschautn Mountains on foot. He
fcays a number of white j>ersons have
made the Journey In sleighs, but they
wire wr&jiped In furs arid, traveled under'
the escort of natives, who provided them
vlth food! In his case, however, he was
clad only Gkn reindeer, parka and ' was
without means of building fires to cook
or warm his food. For days and days
he subsisted wholly on raw fish, and suf
fered severely from the torturing cold.
Among his many trials < was the fording:
of mountain torrents. Frequently, when
weak and ssick, lie was compelled to bal
ance Ills pack on his head; while he
weded painfully through these seething
i masses of broken ice.
I One gloomy morning Iden-Zeller's
* weary eye righted far oft the Arctic
Ocean. Whlie the first glimpse of the
Ice-bound sea revived bis ; spirits 'it by
no means lessened tie task of descend
ing the precipitous mountain sides, for
be was weakened by the* lack of food
and foot sore after- bis days of hard
traveling. At* the close of the 115 th day
of bis mountain tramp he reached the
Arctic coast at a point near the mouth
of the Kockven River, ; and after a short
rest he proceeded along- the coast to
â¢Cape Nord and Xhenec'Â»on.U> Ca;>e-Van
luirexn and Capa Swdze-Kamen,' arriving
at th* latter plac? early last August.
Seventeen, days later he reached a sta
tion -at the JSastcrn Siberian Company,
and from there. he waa conveyed to the
American side in* a small \u25a0- vessel," and

' "In Northeast-Siberia, In the villages of '
Verchojansk. Sredne-Kolymsk, Verchne-
Kclymsk und Pantellcha, the greatest
terrors, so often oictured In tales of Si-:
beria, still exist. The entire country Is
bleak and barren. OftÂ«n in the middle,
it summer the mountain lakes are cov
ered with ice and discomfort seems- to
prevail everywhere. I had the pleasure
of bearinr; from .Verchojansk to Sredne-
Kolymsk, a manlft-st of the Czar. on. the
occasion of the birth of his son. granting
amnesty to a number of political exiles.
These -unfortunate men were of an edu
cated class, but, strangely, were not over
anxious to leave the penal settlement. The
supervision of the police in these places
-is a farce, fur I was allowed to s"ee anar
chistic literature in Verehojansk which
- had : been ./ received through the regular
nfail and 'distributed among the exiles.;
- "Early In " Septemberâ a year agoâ l
reached" Yakutsk, the largest and most
â¢ important of the Northeast Siberian
t towns. It ' is the most northerly tele
graph station Jn the worjd. belns at 62
degrees, north latitude. It was founded In
â¢1632; and in 1535 numbered its population
.at 1650. When I was there It had SCO po
; litlcal-iirtsoners.
"From Yakutsk I journey on to the
v Kaelte-Pole, or the coldest place of exile.
: I was , accompanied by the district chief.
I Ispravnlck, , as police convoy to -Vereho

'.at times our breath actually crystallized
.'before us.' It was midnight of October
; 31 that we arrived at- Verchojan3k. hay-
Jlngjeft Yakutsk October 10. The place
. is.hardly, the size of an American village
/and is covered with small log huts frozen'
over with '-Ice!" presenting a most bleak ap
v pearance^ Undoubtedly, this la the coldest
' spot yet 'lnhabited, on either hemisphere.
It Is situated 67-desrees 37 minutes north
/ latitude and 133 degrees 51 minutes east
It. Is at "Verchojansk that one

~. lights,' ; scintillating* with splendor, pa a
light vapor of icy crystals hovers neir
tiW ' iiÂ»uuad. I found tha thermometer
there registering 2i degrees Reaumer. or
124 degrees Fahrenheit below zero.
"For a fortnight I remained in Vercho
ja;isk as the guest of the district chief.
v. hose house, built of logs, with .snow
for^a roof, is little better. than the habi
tations of other members of the village.
A dozen Russian officials, two ministers,
twelve Cossacks, one or two merhants
and 130 Yakuten constitute the popula
tion of this world-forsaken town, where
the social line is sharply drawn and tha
food most miserable. The ordinary diet
is dried beef, rye bread, bad. tea and thÂ«
Siberian strogauin. a preparation of. â¢
chopped frozen fish, which I am pleased
to say. has a rather palatable taste by
reason of the fact that it la served with
some sort of a mustard dressing. Her*
the political prisoner enjoys the same
privilege oft other inhabitants and draws
a Government allowance of what would
amount to about t) In American money.
"Sredne-Kolymslv is even, more miser
able than Verchojansk. I reached It af
ter three weeks' riding in a reindeer
sleigh. \u25a0 loaned to me as a 'favor for car
rying mail from Verchojansk. Sredne-
Kolymsk will ever he remembered by me,
for . its fishy odors and its remarkabU
howling' polar dogs, that yelp through
out the day and night. So intense Is tha
cold ' in the daytime that unfortunate in
habitants of the village have to keep in
constant motion, and* even then It Is im
possible to remain comfortably warm.
One is continually in a sense of deadly
drowsiness despite the exercise he U
taking. There is no terror felt for death
in Sredne-Kolymsk. When one's time to
die comes he makes no attempt to stay*
off the end. When he passes away his
grave is scooped out In the snow. Blocks
of ice are placed above his rudely con
structed coffin and they mark the burial
place of the departed for many years
after.
"My study of the Russian exile satis
fied my mind that he is a class that pre
fers to lead a shiftless life. His life's
hatred is directed toward the Govern
ment, and the greater the concessions.,
granted "by. the latter to Us subjects. thÂ» Â»
stronger Is his railing against the ruling
power."
The trans-Siberian Journey of Iden-Zel
ler had its pleasant side, for he was met
and. entertained by many noted men.
whose signatures and words of greeting
grace the pages/ of his interesting diary.
In the early part of his trip he was re
ceived by King Oscar of Sweden, and was
al3o greeted by the Crown Prince of Den
mark. In St. Petersburg Iden-Zeller was
the guest of Prince Knilkoff. whose name
is familiar to the An.c -lean people,
among whom he lived for a number of
years In order to avoid being exiled to
Siberia for a political offense. While la
this" country Khilkoff was employed on
the railroads and. after receiving a par
don from the Czar, he returned to Russia
and tool* a prominent part in the con
struction of the Trans-Siberian Railway.
At Jasuju Poiiana the German trave|er
was the guest of Count Leo . Tolstoi and
the tatter's son at their home, and from
the two he received much valuable in
formation regarding the people and tha
country .that be later visited, and letters
to Important persons in Siberia that in
sured him a welcome to many homes on
his trip to the Far East. His diary fa
filled with the signatures of various oflj
ctels. particularly the chiefs of districto
in Siberia through which he passed, cer
tifying to fcls presence in their places of
Jurisdiction and commending him to the
-favor of others. -
Although the hardest part of Iden-Zel
ler's iong tour "L* '\u25a0passed. \u25a0 he still has â¢
many thousands of miles to travel befora
he returns to Berlin. From here hi*
route lies to the south and includes EÂ£l^
Angeles before he starts on bis trip
across the continent. In New York he
will take a steamer for .London and will
visit A number of the largest metropolises
of Europe before reaching Berlin.The Sunday Call

of the present students "miti wondered
whether when they were thirteen or

Kaid Attorney K. C. Chapman. " when we

It was very serious, too.
When ilr. George Leonard, graduate of
lhtt\ took possession of the seat that had
been his more than thirty-rive years ago,
and from that vantage point raised ni*
hand to ask permission to burrow a pen,
there was no hint of amuseme::t amjnj
the regular pupils. His need was gravely
supplied by hto next neighbor a:id til- 1
wurfe went on.
Four o'clock came and with the depart
ure of the majority the reminiscent few
canvassed the playground (which isn't

"There were very few changes," suid
.Mr. Leonard. "'None of us had. been in
the old .school since our graduation anU
yet everything was about the same.
Some of the boys positively identified the
marks cut by themselves in desks and
seats and we thought the blackboard*
were the ones we had used. Of course
it seemed smallerâ yard and room* and
all. We remembered it as a place of
magnificent distances and could not quite
be sure but that the ceilings are much
lower now than 1 thirty-live years ago.
'I remembered when the girla were
transferred to the Denman and Broad
way Grammar schools and the b*d effect
the change seemed to have upon the
boys;. That was in '6Â»i, 1 guess, and for
a time there was a good fleal of rough
ness in some of the classes. The teach
ers were hard pressed to meet the of
ienses with punishments as ingenious,
but in time they won out and the school
lost its reputation for being a trial.
"We all agTeed we would like to find
others who had been students there in
the early days, and particularly some of
the girls, but 1 suppose that would bo
hard to do."
"Those who attended the impromptu
reunion, " said Mr. Chapman. !'were S.
G. Carruthers, Albert Knolle, Abraham
Xewmark, Harry Knolle, John Pepper,
William Brown, J. D. Ralph, C. P. Over

Leonard and myself. .We gathered on -..e*

the others as they got off the car. Liv
ing here in San Francisco, we had not
met for many years. Joseph Grant was
a class-mate and Wallace Bradford and
Fremont Morse. Mayor Schmitz gradu
ated from the Washington too, but later
than rye."
The school held 'its first session
(though it wasn't called Washington
Grammar, then) so long ago as Decem
ber, ISCI. in a small building on Dupont
Ctrefct near Jackson.
Two years later it was removed to
the little Baptist church on Washing
ton street, where, upon the completion of
a ilm-story, the city had rented the
basement lor r.te as a school.
Another two years, and the pupils
were transferred to the house on
Powell street, between Washington and
Jackson, in w4iich since 1650, Rev. R
E. Prevaux had conducted a private
school. The city department lirst se
cured possession In June, 1855, and for
the. next tix years used it for the gram
mar grades.
In ISCI the new building oa the cor
ner of Washington and Mason â now
become the old building â was com
pleted and the. chijdren Joyfully entered
in, leaving the Powell street Institution
a primary.
In the beginning boys and girls
worked and studied and played to
gether, but by 1868 the enrollment had
increased until a new arrangement was
necessary and the Washington became
a boys' grammar school, the girls be
ing transferred to the Broadway Gram
mar. â¢ .
There were eight classrooms then,
but in the next year four additional
looms were fitted up in the basement,
making, a twelve cjass school--a large
one for those days.
Of the early principals, Joseph
O'Connor Is still connected with the de
partment, being now in charge of Mis

"I became principal of the Washing
ton Grammar in "74," said Mr.,O'Connor,
when! I asked "him for some bits of un
written history, "and t remained there
untii 'S3. Those were"* busy days. The
boys were older than the graduates arc
now and they certainly were uctlve.
"I remember when the colored chil-
dren first cair.e to us. There hud dcci
a number of schools for them, but they
wcte poorly attended and in'VS tlÂ«e
board decided to abolish them, and
send the children to wnutever regular
scnools were most convenient, bo we
got our quota.
"On the ttret day after their entry,
fearing trouble, 1 preceded the ranks
out into the yard. No sooner had some
of our boys caught sight of the new
students than they raised a cry of
â¢Ni^-gerl n.g_er:' a.d comn c.iced.
chasing them. i cuught the first
offender and gave him a good thrash
ing and that rather calmed the ardor
of the agitators, so we had no serious
trouble. Within a month the colored
boys had overcome their timidity and
were dashing around with the others,
having as good a time as any.
"We had the first fire drill ever in-
Etituted in the city schools. It worked
admirably when we had no Hie, but
one day a defective gas fitting threat
ened us with a conflagration and I
thought I would never succeed in get
ting the signals sounded.
"That wasn't the fault of the chil
dren, of course, but of the assistant,
who seemed not to understand I was In
a hurry. The flame was soon ex
tinguished, however, and so did no
damage, but I remember to J.his da"y the
anxiety of those few minutes before we
knew how it would come out.
"Even in 'T5 the building was in a
far from perfect, condition. The floors
were uneven and we could sometimes
hear the sound of water underneath.
As there was no way to get \>elow to
see what the trouble was we ha.i UÂ»
have a caipenter cut a hole in :i tloor
and then with candles we went down
to explore. Tne water we hear.l came
fivm buildtr.fcs on the .next lot and the
only reason It had not collected iherc
was that the dry. sandy soil absorbed
it rapidly.' â¢ There were no ventilator^
in the walls so it was not surprising,
that we found the timbers and beams
bad'o' eaten away by rot. I rcmernbei
tlvat'l v/as able to thrust a lath into
one of the main beams with the great

"Some repairs were made to
strengthen the floors and walls, but the
house as a whole was not changed."

The first principal of the Washing
ton was â¢ l-\ K. Jones, who was elected
December, 1831. Then came E. jH.

August, 1556: James Stratton, January,

and Joseph. O'Connor December, 1874.
Since 18S3 there have been but three
changes of administration, the princi
pals being Selden Sturges. T. B. White
and T. H. McCarthy.-
As I sat in: the tiny, detached office
waiting the arrival of the principal, Mr.
McCarthy, there were to be observed
many evidences of the recent, on
slaught of neighborhood boys, by which
the historic Institution was stripped of
reference books, records and supplies.
Two mothers,; accompanied by con
trltc'young sons,. were likewise anxious
to see the 4 principal, and the minutes

**""*-* that she muEt set aside certain
liuui's in each day to undo the
mischief of wrong living, but that she
live a rational life every hour of the
tlay. (Her reward will be the coveted
Ih#oh, v clear complexion.
Many a. infddk'.-aged woman has sac
rificed a good complexion to haste In
all tiling's. She does not take time to
breathe properly, to select her food
ecrciully, to masticate it perfectly, or
10 adjust her clothing 1 ' hygienically;
and then she demands that the masseur
or the dermatologist remove the traces
of her own folly.
# The foundation of a gt>od complexion
is a perfect circulation, and perfect cir
culation is the result of proper breath
sfe*e. perfect assimilation of food and
fiUonal exercise.
The woman with the colorlets face,
the sallow skin, the woman who ' has
pimples here and black heads there,
ur red blotches on her face and par
ticularly on her nose, should sweep cos
metics from her dressing table and go
below the surface of her skin for tbr
root of her muggy complexion. V
Nine chances out of ten. she has
-. never learned how to breathe. Some
women breathe through the mouth ex
clusively. Others never use the lower
. lobes of the lungs, nor employ the
muscles of the diaphragm. Their
bodies starve for oxygen, and the pores
c of their skin tell the tale of improper
' breathing. These women neea deep
breathing as follows:
â¢On arising and the last thing before
going to bed, while you are clad in
your night dress, stand with your back
against the window or door and fill
juur lungs, broathing through the
nostrils with the mouth closed, until
your lungs are able to hold no more.
Retain breath while you count four.
Expel it through the nose counting 1
seven. Practice this movement for ten
consecutive times.
â¢Next, s^tand upright and turn out the
<toes so that the heels touch. Place your
hands on the hi:**, the flngrrs on the
diaphragmâ toe thumbs back In the soft
nart of the back on cither side of the
spinal column- Now, "draw in a deep
. breath and force the' air down, so that
feel the air pressed out through the
* expansion of the lower part of the lungs.
cllold the breath while counting four; cx
i pel while you count seven. Practice this
> movement six times.
Next stand upright, bead up, shoulders
thrown back, arms hanging by the side.

*y~ BOLT Christmas time, motners,
f I having: put the finishing touches
I "| to ihdr own winter wardrobes.
*\u25a0 I ~re sure to find some part of the
â¢* chilcjezis wardrobe that needs
learning up. Many women, in fact,
ivajt until this time before purchasing the
.tÂ«i bttt torments for the little folks,
eÂ«isunh:g that the coming ten weeks will
jluy tuiiK-icnt havoc with fine clothes.
Theu, too, there Is the mother who
lias her sewing done at home. She has
jegun already to plan for the children's
Wash jjocks for spring: wear. They will
be made shortly after the new year,
uud the midwinter fashions {jive her
mi inkling into the coming summer
For the mother who is choosing the
liress-up hat and coat for her little
girl under eight years of age, tnere is
v wide Held of charmingly picturesque
Ueadgcar and outer garments offered
In the Christmas shops. And it may
be added thai there is no excuse for
a child to be unbecomingly dressed
when the styles are so and-un
restricted as they are at present. Ev
ery youthful fashion, as well as most
A the sartorial effects employed for
grown ups find their way into the
wardrobe of the up-to-date little girl.
She Is especially favored in the new
Kmpire modes of her elders' costumes,
which give the youthful effect without
the clumsiness of the old-fashioned
Mother Hubbard. Party coats for
youngsters show this very fashionable
cut. Broadcloth and faced cloth in" the
most delicate shades are used princi
pally, though beaver cloth and cordu
roy shape a number of short-waisted
coats and imitation fur serves admir
ably in place of the more expensive
genuine pelt as effective trimmings.
An example of a broadcloth party
coat is in a peach pink shade of white
â a dead white being seen but iittle in
children's clothes. A yoke effect is
given by a wide band of broadcloth
stitched many times and fastened just
below the bust line to conceal the
gatherings which afford the fullness in
the skirt. Stitched folds of satin trim
the bottom of the skirt, the cuffs tf A
the revers, while baby Irish lace shi js
a etandup collar and a narrow cape Â«-
Another dress coat of pale blue clolh
hangs in wide kilt plaits around the
knees, this short length being met by
black corduroy leggins. Fur cloth
With chinchilla markings forms a roll
ing collar, wide turnback cuffs and the
covering for huge buttons that extend
in a single line down the center of the
front. The hat for wear with this is
a black velvet Tarn O'Shanter held
straight up over the face by a pale blue
pompon.
Most charming is a short jacket of
f!lk beaver cloth cut in Empire style,
a pointed empiecement front and back
effecting the yoke. Black velvet forms
n circular collarette that hangs in long
tabs at the front and black velvet fin
ishes the deep cuffs of the sleeves.
These satiny beaver cloth coats have
gained an unprecedented popularity
this soason and bid fair to continue
their vogue next year. The cloth can
l>e bought in all the rich colorings by
thÂ© yard, and one little girl, whose
mother is deft with the needle, has a
cozy tight-fitting hood and a thickly
Interlined coa,t lit a bright green beaver
that* sets off her pink cheeks to per
fection.
Another warm coat which promises
to be a favorite next winter is a double
breasted semi-fitting garment of
heavy, rough serge, fastened by large
military . frogs built of Bilk hercules
braid. These are particularly suited to
children when the eerge is a brilliant
{> ed closely resembling American Beau
ty. Smartly dressed 1 youngsters are
wearing them this winter with huge
beaver hats in black, with a large
black bow as the only trimming. As a
final elegant touch the fashionable lit
tle maids have an ermine' muft'sus
pended by a black cord around their
neck. Very fetching sets of squirrel
end other of the less expensive pelts
can be purchased as low as $6, If a
mother. is, not fearful of fur accessories
ts a means of bringing colds.
As to the dress-up hat, large flat

A low voice may be heard as effectively
as one that is loud and shrill, if its pos
sessor has learned the art of managing
it properly^ Even In a large building a
person who speaks slowly, giving. every
word its full value, and throwing the
voice from the chest instead of from the
head, will be heard ( distinctly. In order
to have a full, agreeable voice, a girl
should practice deep breathing , several
times a., day: In the open air. The voice
is the expression of health, strength,
character and personality.- The lips, the
teeth, the roof of the mouth, the palate,
the vocal chords and the lungs are all in
volved in this voice of ours, which is our
peculiar endowment, and lifts us up to
the .highest plane in creation.
I will suppose that some girl for whom
I am , writing has. contracted a slovenly
way of." talking, that her -voice is not
pleasant, and that her enunciation is in
distinct. How shall she break herself of
bad habits? -Just as she would break her
self of a bad habit in any other direction,
she must set herself to work about this
and be downright earnest if she Is to
accomplish anything worth >#hlle. She
must remind herself constantly, if she Is
accustomed to shriek, that people around
her are hot deaf, and that If they were
they would hear her as easily if she spoke
low.as'ifshe spoke loudly. Every time
she begins speaking as if she were a sol
dier on i trie !* warpath, let her call a halt,
and drop her voice a tone or two.' If she
has the heedless method of. omitting the
finai g and saying mornin' for morning,
and evenlh' for, evening, let her remedy
that.', If she runs her words together, as
.too many, of \u25a0 us do ; under . the impression
that there Is no. time to spare, and that'
words must: tumble over each other as

Two i girls the other day were discussing:

Is the prettiest little accent like a fra
grance^' We often notice this crystalline
perfection in foreigners who have ac
quired English and speak it less reck
lessly and with more precision than we
who are to the manner born. Dear girls,
take your time. There is plenty of it.
Neither rush nor shout, nor cackle, nor
make a shrill clamor when you are talk
ing, but remember. Shakespeare's low and
gentle voice which Is an excellent thing:
in woman.
Of course, no girl who respects herself
ever fumes, frets or scolds. There is a
scolding voice and there Is a fretting
voice, and both are most repellant. Fancy
comlrig suddenly into the presence of a
gril whom you have always thought
lovely and attractive, .and finding her
storming and using Invectives and find
ing fault in a coarse, hateful way: that
would show you that her character had a
very seamy .'side., You could never have
the same opinion of such a girl again. It
would be as if under the fair outside you
had seen a glimpse of something dark
and repulsive within. Probably few girls
offend by passionate vehemence of this
kind, yet now and then one who has not
learned self-control may be betrayed by
her temper and her voice may reveal a
state of things that those who love her
must deplore.
Not only should you be careful about
your voice in private, but do not over
look the fact that In public places a girl's
voice' 1 should not be so raised as to make
her conspicuous. For instance, If you gu
to : a matinee or a concert, have in mind
the people about you who have bought
tickets and wish to listen to the perform
ers, and do not let your own conversation
go on at a time when attention should
be fcr.used on the stage. If you are In
cars or ferryboats make It a rule neither
to discuss your friends nor mention ab
sent, persons by name. This is a little
world, â¢ and you never know but some
body may be near you who knows all
about yourself and the persons about
whom you are talking. A girl may live
in New .York, Philadelphia , or Louisville,
and she may be talking In San Francisco
or Calcutta or; Bombay, with a friend

Refinement and Intelligence arÂ» shown *
by the voice as quickly as by the face.
Illiterate people sometimes have sweet
voices, especially In some countries, but

t-olor for her guests. Not only was her
housfc to be trimmed with pink, but her
dinner gowns were all selected in this
shade and, as far as practicable, her
guest? were requested to bring dresses
in this hue. Everything from dome to
cellar was to be in pink. Even the in
vitations were written upon letter
paper of the most delicate shell pink
and throughout the mansion pink
abounded. The wardrobe of the hostess
was almost entirely in that shade. And
th[s for a fad!
The house party of the Duchess of
Roxburg-he is drawing a great number
of fashionable folk to the handsome
mansion which the American Duchess
lias refurnished and rehabilitated since
her marriage to the English peer.
So great I* the state installed here,
and such is the magnificence of the en

society. There is nothing bizarre, but
all is cJfgaut.

them on the lines of Louis XI. Her color
was a cold tone and her material a bril
liant satin face cloth. She made tne dress
with a sweeping skirt, full all the way
around, and a little short coat belted in
at the waist. At the front it was secured
with a large gold button. The coat was
trimmed with gold lace and a auantity
of gold thread trimmed the. sleeves and
the ripple of the coat. The skirt had a
very deep flounce of gold lace and there
were festoons of the lace above the
flounce.
Another suest ordered a gown of the
JB3O period with Empire tendencies ir. that
the dres3 had a very short waist trimmed
with lace over the shoulders and belted
with a very wide girdle of silk. There
was a trimming of insertion set in the
skirt and some gold thread embroidered
the hem.
Very Elecant (;Â«nsÂ» Itequlred.
Gowns for holiday house parties are
exceedingly elaborate. It was once the
rule that* little was needed and visitors
came bringing a dress suit case into
which was packed an evening gown.
This, with an extra shirt waist, consti
tuted enough for the visit. But those days
are no more.
A Visitor arrived at a week end party,
from Friday to Monday, bringing with
her two trunks, three hat boxes and a
dress suit case. In the trunks were two
dancing gowns, three dinner toilets, a
golf suit, two handsome automobile
coats, three negligees and a luncheon
gown. There were petticoats and several
changes of shoes and lingerie and .there
were also gloves and all the small trim
mings of the costume sufficient to make
a complete change of appearance each
hour during the three days' stay.
It is the rule at the week end party not
to repeat yourself and she who goes must
be prepared to wear a different costume
each meal and something elaborate in the
evening.
The pretty woman who can wear light
pink Is now in her very element, for,
among the new tones, are several in pale

is one of the very pretty things of the
season.
A woman who dresses remarkably well,
but who manages to do it upon very lit

simple dress of soft pink taffeta. The

dress was made on '. the new lines
which show the gathered skirt rather

there was a little hand w embroidery in

The waist was cut on the .shirt waist
pattern, blousing a very little-in front and
just a little' ln the back. VTliere were
sleeves cut off at what is called -bridge
length and a 'little vine of \u25a0 pink; flowers
decorated the neck. Nothing simpler "or \
prettier could be ~ found. . The cost" was
very moderate, as the taffeta was of \ the
inexpensive variety and the embroidery
war'all done 'at home.
Hovr to Transform a Dress.
For a change the owner of this gown, .
the very next night at dinner, wore the :
very same dress with the neck ; filled in
with a lace yoke cut rounding in '.the.
throat and finished with a tiny white
ruching. The sleeves were made elbow .
length with I white lace and there jvere
ribbon trimmings arranged upon the skirt
in the form of; ribbon choux{ surrounded
by, wheels of lace. It changed the sown
slightly and was pretty.

*\u25a0 unless ' you/have a number of coats, you

must be built on widely different lines. "'
In the long coats the seven-eighths coat
is the thing, the three-quarter coat being
â¢much 1 too "'short. .'.The seven-eighths coat
comes almost to the feet and is fitted and
belted and made to set well to the figure.
.One of the handsomest of these seven-
eighths- coats was built* of tan colored
cloth 1 with strips of .heavy tan colored
torchon lace set in the coat from the neck
right down ' to the bottom of the skirt.
The coat which was for* nice wear was'
fastened around tb.e waist With 'a cloth
girdle overlaid with lace. The garment
was quite unique and very becoming.
"What Yon Will Need In Coat*. ,
"/At all the house parties. and the week
ends one must have a fur-lined coat. And
this is not so difficult, for coats come lined
with/cheap gray fur and with gray and
white fur and with the common varieties
or black fur.. A wide mink or Persian
lamb collar or one.of squirrel or of-ermine
completes the appearance.
If~you areT- thinking of getting a fur
lined coat be sure to get one with sleeves.
. Big sleqves, quite baggy,' and coming into
a cuff at the hand are the distinctive fea
ture of many of the fur-lined coats. The
coat ;ltse!f fits quite snugly or as snugly
.as r circumstances -will permit, and its
length is a u seven-eighths or very nearly'
to the floor. Thus one has a beautiful and
a comfortable garment..
The very long coat is deep blue. Dark
red or brown is worn a great deal also
and so is deep dahlia. There Is a hand
some' coat made of smooth goods that
fairly ; glistens. . If one likes" the mixed
goods one can. get a . Scottish material,
slightly rough, and made on long lines.
The sleeves are big and'the whole ts ex
quisitely tailored. There is a velvet col
lar "and there are smart flare cuffs.
.It is. said that none but a- professional
tailor can make the long coats of the year
and that the woman who is trustinsr to a
modiste' will be disappointed. Certain it
\u25a0Is Jhat the seams are cleverly strapped
~and f that the stitchery is perfect, and that
everything throughout is as nearly man
nish as the. feminine garments of the :
season can well be.
,- It~is by.no means, a mannish season.
Yet one sees traces of- the very severe
tailor-made garments which were once so
much .worn. The new coats are long and
tailored and the seams are stitched and
strapped. - There is a certain severity
which marks the street suits of the win
ter.
For the house â all is flufflne?? and
beauty and the wardrobe of the up-to-
date woman is divided into two distinct
parts, the fluffy gowns arid the severe.
Very Mannlnh for the Street.
It wajs a very modish woman who di
rected her 1 maid to divide and subdivide
her gowns i "Into one clothespress put my
tailor-made dresses," said she, "my se
vere broadcloth suit, with Us seven
eighth coat and its short full skirt. Into
the same clothespress let my street Eton
be Dlaced. the one of merino, interlined
and stitched and trimmed with braid. My
Scottish belted suit and my cheviots and
serges are air classed together in thi3
wardrobe. And here let my flannel shirt
waists, my heavy dark silk separate bo
dices apd all my cashmeres and merinos
be hunsr. Put no scent in this clothes
press. My fluffy dresses, the challies, the
crapes, the voiles and the light thin stuffs
go into another clothespress which must
hang heavy with scent. And In thl3 way
my wardrobe is divided."
The maid.did^as she was bidden, divid
ing the gowns as one would separate the
sheep from the goats and securing for
each an . appropriate place.
The reason why one puts . cheviot 3.
broadcloths, ladles* ..cloths, zibelines,
serges, mixed good 3 and heavy woolens
and camel's hair goods together is that
these materials are tailor-made this sea
son. They are stitched and strapped and
trimmed with velvet which is applied
along the most severe lines. And there
is nothing about them to suggest the Re
naissance or the revival styles.
The thinner materials, on the other
hand, are delicate In the extreme. One
lovely gown, made for Mrs: John Jacob
Astor, now ' the queen of society by
popular vote, was in organdie of the
blue-white crisp sort which was once
used only for the gown of a young girl.
This is tucked and pin tucked and It is
trimmed with lace insertion and with
hands of band embroidered lace. It is
made dancing: length and the waist is
trimmed across the front with bands
running' from side seam to side seam.
. Now a few of the prettiest evening
dresses arc made of freak materials, if
one may so designate them, i There la
a chiffon taffeta which reminds one of
silk mull. It is made over "a lining of
silk muslin. or over a taffeta lining, and
it is made all ruffles and lace.
A Hint on Evening: Dressea.
For evening It is very fashionable to
line and interline a gown. Your lace
dress must have its chiffon lining, and
then comes the lining of glossy taffeta
or of thin satin. And, finally, if you
want to be very smart, you have an
other lining of taffeta. All the ma
terials are very thin, and so well fitted
that they do not make the figure bulge.
Fine fitting i 3 a very distinctive
feature of the dresses of the hour.
They are made to set so snugly to the
waist that one looks as though one
were molded into them. And they are
fitted throughout, nothing being left to
chance. h V -"
It is a pity that the tight waist is
back, yet woman looks very chic in it.
A dancing gown of gold colored crepe
de chine, tight to the waist, belted
with gold colored embroidery, done in
white and silver and finished with a
band of .the same embroidery around
the square neck, was the prettiest thing
at; a holiday ball. The waist was
drawn into a wasplike size, and the
bust and hips were full, giving the
figure the typical hour-glass appear
ance. But what can one say, and how
may one; object, when. Dame Fashion
says it 'is the thing to do this!
The foreign fashion papers are writ
ing ;up Mrs.\ John Jacob Astor as the
most'- fashionable Woman of Dame
Fashion's world. When she leli Paris
a. few weeks ago her gowns, were
photographed and snapshots were taken
of. her; as she, stepped out of her car
riage and as she walked on the streets.
Women Who Live in Ruts
DO you live in a rut? Women are
very apt to do so, although the
majority of them are loth to
admit it. Narrow-mindednes3,
which is so often a result of a life
. spent within contracted limits, is com
mon to women, they say, t"Ut the ac
. cused will answer, "Why, my life is
not narrow! I have my house, my
profession, or my social circle. Do
you call that living in a rut?" 1
Any or all of these interests may,
however, result- In stagnation, men
tally and physically, and what is
worse, conversationally. Either a
* woman or a man is at liberty to devote
, all of his or her interest to a certain
object. But what about the friends of
that person? One may have a sym
pathetic interest In a friend's occupa
. tlon. or in her children, or in her bridge
playing, but. one occasionally becomes
a little wearied of a repetition, a con
stant recurrence to that pet subject of
the innocent but short-sighted womaji
who harps eternally upon one subject.
â¢ Bhe devotes her mind and energies to
that: subject, to the exclusion of all
others.' She dreams of it, she. ponders
over it, * and only too . readily she re-
Pen and ink sketches, many of them
fanciful, were made of her In her
boudoir. Such a charming woman wa3
never seen before according to their
dictum.
Mrs. Astor is wearing now on various
occasions three handsome long coats
any one of which is worthy a page in
the fashion chronicler's report. The
first i 3 a deep red cloth coat, cut tight
fitting In the back, tight fitting on the
hips, and rather straight In front. It
is buttoned with dark horn buttons and
the seams are stitched and strapped.
It is tailored throughout and is worn
with a dark red skirt to match. The
whole is of broadcloth, a lovely concep
tion In woman's dress.
A Clonk That Dcoome* Yon.
The second clcak is made Empire fash
ion. Its material is cream colored satin
faced cloth and it is cut with a short
waist belted with silk which is carried
around the waist in many fold 3. At the
side there Is a big silver buckle. . There 13
" a turnover silk collar and the entire cloak
is silk lined.
The third cloak is a fur-lined affair built
of dark brown cloth. The lining is chin
chilla and there ts a big square chinchilla
collar. The coat Is fitted front and back,
the sleeves are full at the shoulder and
tapering toward the wrist, and the bottom
is finished so. that a rim of the fur is vial
.ble. It is a lovely cloak and one which is
admired everywhere.
With three cloaks of this kind one can
do without the fur jacket and one can dis
pense with the other 'coats now so much
worn, the loose backed affairs and the cir
cular cape coats. Indeed a fur-lined three
quarter coat is the coat of the season and
with this one can get through the year
very nicely.
Speaking of outfits for the winter a
French fashion writer has this to say:
"The time has passed by," remarks this
authority, "when women select their
wardrobes in a haphazard manner. Wo
men now prepare as carefully for the
winter as for the summer and they make
their dress plans a long way in advance.
We ouy winter trousseaus for wemen who
are going to stay home, domestic women,
and women of small means. They want
to be well dressed and they are wlllins
to bestow a little time and study upon
their wardrobes.
"This winter we are selecting gowns in
rough goods with an almost invisible
plaid. There is a rough surface and a
tiny line of color runs through the goods.
Some of these gowns and coats are very
attractive and In almost every case we
make a coat, a skirt and a short coat.
Juat a Word About House Dresses.
The princess peignoir is a pretty thing.
Snug-fitting In the front, it slopes away
into long- graceful lines in the back. It Is
comfortable yet beautiful, and its bright
particular virtue is that it will answer as
a pretty house dress as well as for negli
gee purposes. You can make these gowns
with long graceful lines, that add much
to a woman's height.
The most delicate tones are used for the
negligees. One sees mole-colored taffetas
trimmed with a deeper shade of ribbon
and decorated with lace. And one sees
the new shades of carnation pink, which
are truly beautiful in their sheen. But tha
loveliest effects of all are produced with
velvet, which makes up into the most
gorgeous of tea gowns.
Velvet as a material for a tea gown
seems extravagant. Yet one can do a
great deal with the aid of a seamstress.
A pale pink velret tea gown, cut in prin
cess shape, trailing, yet not very long,
and trimmed with lace, was the distinc
tive feature' of a very handsoma ward
robe. This gown, which would wear for-
ever, for there Is no wear out as far a.s
velvet is. concerned, was trimmed with
lace laid over pink taffeta, which was
cut in scallops and appliqued around the
fcot of the skirt and down the front.
The coat and skirt idea is one that
grows upon you. Take a skirt of lace,
with strips of ribbon insertion, and wear
with it a little lace coat with ribbon in
serted, and you have something pretty.
Underneath you can wear a handsome
lace corset cover or can wear a thin sum
mer shirt waist, which serves as an un
derwalst.
The little house coats are too pretty to
be ignored. Make them up along the pa
jama lines, using- an old pajama coat as
a pattern, or make them up as short ki
mono jackets with wide sleeves. Let the
material be one of several materials, for
you can take a choice of fine French
flannel or taffeta, of cheap satin, of piece
lace, of voile or of veiling. Ii you prefer
you can go into the challis and the other
cheap cotton goods. No matter what
your material, let the lines be straight
and good. And let the shape be a. true
kimona or a true pajama shape, for the
simpler the cut the better.
verts to it so constantly that her
friends at last wi3h themselves miles
away.
The society devotee is quite as apt to
overdo the matter as her more domes
tic sister, and the woman with a pro
fession talks "shop' entirely too much
as a rule.
But she should not allow herself to
dwell entirely upon one phase of life.
There is plenty of Interest In other
people's affairs, there are gay and ab
sorbing pictures in the vista of dally
life, and every woman shoulrt watch
herself lest she fall into a rut
of one sort or another. It Is surpris
ing- to- find how readily the habit 13
formed â more readily, of course, by
women than by men. as the latter are
thrown more into the world's happen
ings.
A woman ' should ever beware of
making herself the central subject of
her talkâ her home, her profession, her
health, how naturally she comes to t-on
sider them. And it: is quite natural
that she should. But before she bur

INTO that famous Christmas drawer,
already crammed with delightfc!
secrets for fortunate somebodies,
there's aimost sure to be tucked or.c
blouse pattern, embroidered by hand,
for the gift to the best girl. For, though
lingerie blouses have had things all
their owr way for so many seasons.
it is oniy this year that embroidering
them for gifts has proved a positive
fad. Tt's really no more work than a
centrepiece, or a set of doilioe. and
certair.lv a much more personal gifi."
Eyelet embtoidery is probably the
rrtoÃi popular form this year, although
soMd embroidery is a close second, the
combination proving perhaps most sat
isfactory of all.
The design printed is the exact si^e
for half the front. To transfer the
pattern, make a tracing, reversing it
for the other side, and applying it to
the linen by means of impression pa
j>er. Between the two sidrs there
rhould be a space of perhaps an ir.eh.
The collar piece is a motif by itself.
which may be applied, also, to cuffs,
or. in the" newer way, to the tops of
the sleeves.

CHRISTMAS is the Chil- "
ciren's Day. 1 said Lhat in
my Thanksgiving Talk, but
the thought is one that it is
well to impress upon our minds as
the- holy season draws near. For,
to enjoy this day of da; s in the true
Christmas spirit, we must all be as
littJe children. Just for a little
while let us lay aside the tbov.ght
of the toil and the stress, the get
ting and losing, the petty vexation*
and the still more petty jealousies of
daily iife. ' On this day we r.re all
children together. \u2666 u -" li; .ng with the
joy of doing something to make oth
ers happy, -with the delight of giv
ing, and with the eagerness to see
all the good things that have come
to every one else.
There is much talk â some of if de
cidedly wise, some of it heartlessly
foolish â of the evil of gift-making.
Without stopping here to go into the
ethics of the patter, it may be well
to call attention to the fact that at
no other season is there so much
pood-natured and unselfish jollity as
during the holidays. Note the
crowds coming home on street and
railroad cars late- la the evening,
laden down with parcels of all siz?s
and description, footsore and weary.

"C7HETJ GIVING IS A TAX
But pvil creeps in when the giv
ing becomes a tax. E'.id rease* to b n
a pleasure. And it in the place of
the housemother to see thnt this is
not the case in her nest. The giving
must not be done "grudgingly nor of
necessity," if it would be gracious.
In one family there was in Lang
Syne/ a method of making presents
which divided the burden (if it can
be so called) equally among the
members of the household. Several
months beforehand a Christinas box
or fund was started. Into this lock
ed bos were dropped, by -each mem
ber of the family, sucL coins as he
could spare. They accumulated
gradually until a fortnight before
Christmas, when the t was held what
was called "a famik council." All
â the .father and mother and the
children â met to apportion to each
person his or her gift. First, the
father was told to go out of the
room, and a vote was taken as to
what should be given to him. and the
money for that was taken from the
box. ~3Text. ihe mother was banish
ed and the father recalled, and her
gift was chosen. Afterward, one
child at a time left the room, and
the others decided on what he or she
should have. Of course, the parents'
gifts took more money than did
those of the little children, for toys
dH not cost much, and in this ar
rangement the children concurred
ioyfullv. Surely such- a method wa?
nn illustration of the principleâ' In
honor preferring one another.
In another home, where many
friendless students â boys and girls
far from horne â spend Christmas.
fkÂ«rÂ« is a- tree, and nn.this is a pi ft
for *acl\. person, and every ore of
the number who receives gives
R.orriPiMYii to *>very other nerson.
GIFTS AT 25 CENTS APIECE
Eut there is one law that must not
bfc disobeyed: no gift shall iwt more
than 2.> rents. To depart from this
would be fonsidercd unkind and un
fair. One may pay as little as ho
\visheÂ« for a gift, but one cannot go
bcyontl irx* suns named. The ar
:\u25a0.'Â».ligemcr.t sivoÂ« rise tr> much merri
inciit One girl whose hair was al
tvays falling down, as it was so heavy
;bat it defied the stoutest pins, re
ceived a paper of hairpins elaborate
iv tied with violet ribbon; another,
uiio "couiulaincd of cold hands and
lci>l. received a uuy doll'o T J*t water
Lag arid inufl; the old-maid aunt,
who had Â»ea in her room every day,
had a cheap, but pretty, Japanese
teapot; to the youth whose dande
liciwJown moustache was struggling
to face the world, was given a gor
peous shaving mug. It may all seem
billy to the c6ol-hcaded and prac
tical observer â silly and childish.
But who would be practical, and
who 'would not be a child at Christ
mas timel J v \u25a0 '
One.woiaan this year has (so far
its her own practice is concerned)
reversed -the usual custom of giving
to those who expect her to do so, or
tc whom she has been in the habit
Â» of making gifts. She is now prepar
ing Rifts for those from whom she
expects nothing, and who cannot
send her anything. One great com
fort in remembering the poor is
the fact that one raav not be-ac
cused of giving in the hope of a re
turn in kind.
As this is the home feast, let
greens and other decorations be such
as can be arranged by the members
cf the family. To many of us the
odor of evergreen brings back a rush
of memories of byaronf Christmase?.
of happy faces, of cheering arroet
ings. Let, u?' not deny our children
- such memories for their future days.
Have ihe prevailing: colors green
and red. the former much in evi

PRETTY. WINDOW. DECORATIONS
" A pretty iffaa is to frame each win

the croiind pirr* or running cedar,
forking it -with: tiny brads '.to the
window casing, so that one looks out
upon a white world through n green
frame. ' Tf one i<" whore holly and

at fancy prices, qse tlieni sparingly.
Instead of the red of the holly, have
wreaths, and .festoons tied with bowÂ«
of bright scarlet baby ribbon. Of
cottoo-back ribbon, suitable for this
purpose. ,one. may buy a roll . of ten'
yards for 12 cents.'- If liolly i^ very

promotes mirth, or that produces a

The question of the /Christmas
tree is perennial. In many families
the grown people still cling* to the
dear old emblem. Even when Santa
Claus has growu to mean. only the
Spirit of Christmas, and the dress
ing of the tree is no longer a "mys
terious rite performed after each of
the younger members of the house
hold is in bed, "while visions of
sugar plums dance in his head" â
still we hate to part with the tree.
Of "course, a great deal of work, and
a great deal of disorder later. If
there are children in the family, put
aside these considerations, and trim
the tree, large or small. It means
more to the little ones than we can
imagine, unless we have very dis
tinct recollections of our own youth.
A TINY TREE ON A TABLE
A pretty expedient, when a large
tree is out of the ouestion, is a tiny
one to stand in the centre of the
dining table. Have this fastened
firmly in a wooden stand, and wind
over the stand strands of running
cedar. Then trim the tree. It may
lie made a veritable fairy like struc
ture. At any toy shop ono may buy
liny candles an inch or two long,
with holders. Fasten these all over
the tree. A pretty notion is to hang
on this bush, of evergreen a tiny
scarlet. box ol bonbons for each per
son at the table. Ai the end of the
meal, these are taken off and the
contents eaten with, or after, the
coffee. Tiny colored beads, and
strands of tinsel hang from the
miniature branches. From the chan
delier over the little tree suspend a
red tissue paper Christmas bell, such
as one sees for sale at thousands
of shops at this season, and from the
edges cf tins bell fasten yards of
green or other vine to meet
the top of the tree. Streamers of
ground piuc wound with narrow
scarlet ribbon can run to the four
corners of the table. Sprigs of cedar
dropped here and there upon the
cloth add ttÂ» ihe "Christmassy" ef
fect.
All these tilings, should be but the
outward and visible sign of an in
ward and spiritual joy â a brightness
that must make the whole year more
glad because of the Gift of Gifts
that came to the world on the first

Christmas
Candy
4? \u25a0 '. ~
A GIRL, who was ! famous
" among friends and family
,for her skill in candy mak
ing, found herself facing
? ihe problem one Christmas Â«f an
almost empty purse and a long
Christmas list.
. /There was only o-^'thing for it â
either to give some of her candy,. or
to- abandon the idea of Christmas
presents at all. Somehow. Christ
mos. wouldn't be Christma3 without
givir.g. so the candy won the day.
Fortunately, she knew plenty of
kinds to make. For days before
Christina's she was busy getting the
numerous things ready. Nuts had
to be shelled and blanched; harm
less coloriutr matter secured, and
â¢the prettiest little boxes and bas
kets made of crinkled tissue paper
and pasteboard, or of heavy water
color puper. decorated prettily with
water-color paints.
The day before Christmas she
shut herself up in the kitchen, with
pans and kettles and plates â any
thing and everything ready * : to her
hand" for the work.
Her fudges were many and varied.
Some, made exactly like chocolate
fudge fwith the chocolate left out),
were a delicious invention of her
own, the result of an experiment
one day when' sire wanted to make
Candy nnd found she had no choco
la<p., Two cups of sugar, one of
'milk. and a good tabl^spoonful of
butter were put in a double boiler
end allowed to boil for five minutes,
then taken off the fire and beaten
pniii the top began to glaze ever so
Into the mixture was
poured n cupful of finely chopped
unts and half a teaspoonful of va
nilla; it was stirred again quickly
and turned out/ to cool.
A TASTY CHOCOLATE FUUGE
Leaving out the nuts and adding
half ti cake of bitter ehucolate
made the most delieiou3 chocolate
fud^r. When some of her choco
late fudge turned out an apparent
failure, she dumped into it a cup of
molaÂ«se?. put it all on to boil up
for five minutes, and turned out a
batch of caramels. â¢ â¢ \u25a0
}faple sugar fudge she. madj by
hoilinir two cups of crushed maple
~ugar with one of cream. But it
was a wonder to Â«ret just right, and.
unlike the chocoLtc fueg'b. stayed a
failuro v when it turned out thnt way.
Chocolate fudge poured ever a
i hick layer of chopped marshmr.l
lows made a fudge variation that
was immensely popular, partly be
ffu^e the mrrshniallows offset tho
cloving sweetness of the fudge.
Ent the ncv.-e:.t form of fudge
wes made witlv honey and cream.

" Fudge . biscuit she made for the
girh who were at boarding school?,
and Who couldn't get, home for the
holidays.- She packed them in small
cracker tins. . They were simply
small crackers, spread^ thickly with
fudge-, with, another cracker laid on
top.
With fondant as a foundation, all
sort 3 of interesting cream candies
and bonbons were made. To maka
this fondant, she put two cups of
granulated sugar, half a cup of
water and a pincli of 'â¢'â¢earn of tar
tar into a double boiler, letting it
boil until a little dropped in â¢ cold
water formed into a soft ball be
tween her finarers. TUs wa3 hard
to do. for the moment when it is
just cooked enough to form, instecl
of separating, is the moment when
it must come off, or be too stiff. Sha .
let it cool, and then stirred h until
it grew creamy, then turned it out
and worked it, like a batch of bread,
until every lump war. out of it and
it was a smooth lot of cream.
EVOLUTION OF A CONFECTION
Some of it she flavored with va
nilla and rolled into little bali3
(some with a nut in the centre) and
dipped into chocolate, using a long
wire with a loop on the end for dip
ping. The chocolate was the ready
sweetened kind, melted and kept
soft by being stood in hot water.
These were the beginnings. From,
them sprang all sorts of pink and
violet-tinted bonbons, dippiug balls
of the cream in the tinted crenm.
Peppermint cream and chocolate
covered peppermints were made by
adding a few drop 3 of oil of pepper
mint to ths fondant, and winter
grecti drop* by the addition of es
sence of wintcrgreen.
Hvc-rton taffy came out crisp and'
.delicious. Half a pound each of but
ter and granulated sugar wero boiled
for fifteen minutes, and poured out
in buttered tin 3.
Her fondant ran short before she
came to the dish of English v.alnnts.
which had been carefully shelW. to
keep the halves unbroken. So Â«he
stirred confectioner's sugar tnd
cream together until it was of_ the
consistency of the fondant, flavored
it with vanilla and put half an Eng
lish walnut on each side.
It was a long, hard day's work,
with results in the shape of burns
and blisters, a face very much
flushed, and aching muscles; but
when the various kinds were sorted,
and packed in their pretty recep
tacles, her gifts 'loomed up well,
after all," as her small sister (and
general helper) ob-orved.
Then. too. that sharo line of demarca
tion, called In the Orient "caste." and

EUROPE OBSERVES ANCIENT CHRISTMAS CUSTOMS
ENGLISH ROYAL COUPLE SERVED WITH W
Children in Ho I/and Hang Up Their Shoes About
Chimney Place and Paris Makes a Gay
Carnival of the Occasion.- -
LONDON, Dec. 23.â 1n. spite of cynical
writers, who never fail to assert that the
X English Christmas is not what it used to
v lÂ»e, there is little fault to be found with
the wav in which the Yuletide is ob
served in this country. It's true, more's
the pity, that the Yule log is a thing of
the past, and that in few households in
this country, except the King's, does the
"boar's head" play its ancient part, but
aside from these things Christmas in
England is kept much as it was in Dick
tns' time:
In ail the great country houses there are
Christmas gatherings. Still "the stock
ings are hung by the chimney with care,"
still the Christinas tree bears its myste
rious fruit and still the pudding names
at the end of the day's great repast. Even
the carol keeps Its place. All over tne
country within a few days of Christmas
you may hear the "waits," as they are
calledâ children who sing "God Bless You.
Merry Gentlemen." and "I Saw Three |
Ships," under your windows in the even
ing in the hope of pennies. Why they call
them "waits" nobody, seems to know, ex
cept that they do wait for the coppers.
Yes, England gives itself up to Christ
inas in quite the old way, all except
London. Throughout the provinces there
is snow to help out the picture, but Lon
don, with its damp, chilly air and soot
laden fogs, does not lend itself *o a "Mer
rie Christmas." The streets wear a
gloomy aspect. All places of amusement
Â«xc closed. There are no public festivi
ties or demonstrations. What mirth there
is is all within doors.
BOXTXG DAY CELEBRATION.
But on the next day, Boxing day, which
Is also a ho'tcay, everything is different
The streets are full again, the theaters
reopen, the pantomimes, dear to the heart
of the true cockney, begin, and London
ers revel afreah In ,the old stories of
"Dick Whittington and His Cat," "Cin
derella" and "Blue Beard." Boxing day,
by the way, is believed to take its name
Irom the universal custom of giving
Christmas "boiea." or tips, to all serv
ants and other factotums on that day.
3t is London's great day of the whole
year.
Meanwhile at Sandring-ham, the King
and Queen do their best to preserve the
traditions of tho old-fashioned Christmas
in their celebration. Their .Majesties are
always served with a boar's head, a baron
of beef and a gigantic plum pudding. The
boar's head its usually a present from the
Kaiser, and laid upon a silver dish, with
its tusks highly polished; It Is carried
- ehoulder-high. into the dining hall, at
â¢which time the carpi is sung, beginning
with the words:
The King's boar-head In hand ! I bring
â¢ BÂ«dÂ«cke4 with bays and roeemary.
And I pray you good people be merry-
In the remoter rural districts many
cuaint old Christmas customs still sur
vive. In Yorkshire, bands of children go
wassailing, carrying with them a rude
travesty of the Nativity in the form of a
huge doll, decked with mistletoe, and
cinq the old sons, "Here We Come a-
Wassailins:/* which, like the carol- of the
"waits," may be literally interpreted as
a reauest* for pennies. And, of course,
toe "Christmas box" is always forthcom
fSs. â¢ -
OBSERVANCE IX GERMAVIV
But, after all, to find Christmas ' cole- !
brated with all the ancient â¢ zest, * one \u25a0
must go to Germany. For Germans the .'
day is still a period for sentimentality, '
â¢ time for family reunions â¢ in \u25a0 the * old
Special Cable Â».o Ttu; Gall.
\u25a0 hemÂ», an occasion for givingr and receiv
ing- a multitude of presents and an oppor
tunity of exchanging 'friendly greetings
with the whole circle of one's \ relatives
and friends. The Christmas tree, too,
originated in Germany and during the
â¢week preceding: Christmas the market
places and squares of irery town In the
Fatherland are stacked. with heaps of fir
trees of -all sizes, which in* due course
art- to be I- used - for Christmas. As the
Yuletide approaches, these heaps of fir
trees prow smaller and smaller." until on
December 21 there are very few or none I
at all left."- " '
it ih a noint of honor in every Ger
man family' to have a Christmas ' tree
for- the children and many households
continue to observe the custom even
wliyi all the members of the family have
became adults. Wealthy Germans have a
Christmas tree which extends from the
floor â¢ io the ceiling- of a lofty chamber
and Jills with its huge branches the
greater part of a large room, and the
Fize of the tree decreases : in each house
hold in proportion to the decreasing
world prosperity of the respective fami
lies. In poor houses the Christmas : tree
is nothing more than a twig of a fir tree
stuck in a pot and placed in the center
or the table.
\u0084, In < every case the Christmas tree is
Illuminated. If it is a big tree it is hung
*rith hundreds of Chinese lanterns and
candles, wnich throw a brilliant light '
over the imposing array of presents j

CHRISTMAS TREES FOR ALL.
One peculiarity of Christmas In Ger
many is that the celebration takes place i
on Christmas eve instead of on Christ- i
mas day itself. The celebration begins i
soon after sunset on December 24 and *
concludes on - the same evening. Christ
mas day itself is simply a public holiday â¢
on which the nation enjoys itself. All
theaters and places of amusement are
closed on December 24 and are "open
again the next day. f
The, programme of proceedings on the '
Heilige Nacht. as Christmas . eve Us
called in Germany, is in its 'essential
features the same in every German fam
ily.' First the family circle gathers ]
round the Christmas tree and sings- one
or two Christmas carols, for the Ger- 1
mans are a* nation of musicians. The
husband then embraces his wife - and
kisses her; father and; mother embrace
and kiss all their^ehildren, and the chil
dren embrace and - kiss one another, if
more distant \u25a0 relatives and even ' friends
and acquaintances are present they also
receive and bestow, kisses on all present.
There is, in short, a general outbreak
of klssiug. At most family gatherings
some benevolent elder, wearing afur cap, - .
long white beard, and .red cloak .enacts
the role of Santa ; Claus ' arid "distributes
the gifts. - _^_ â¢',;\u25a0â¢â¢; .â¢;\u25a0;'
In many German households 7the ; patri- ]
archal custom^ of allowing the domestic '
servants to participate in the'Christmaa
festivities ,is still observed. - Presents i for "
the servants are hung on "the 1 family
Christmas tree, and although the domes

Now that the appeal has gone out for
the members of the order to subscribe to
the popular loan bonds of the order, there
has been a great demand for such, and
it is expected from the orders that are
being received by the grand recorder that
before the close of the current month the
amount will exceed $24,000. The. money
to be raised in this manner'is for^the pur
pose 'of obtaining a sum equal to that
due the, jurisdiction of California by the

Long time we have been hearing of
Alice Xielsen in grand ooera, little Alice
Nielsen, who used to do "bits" at the
Tivoli, and finally emerged to fame in a
charming Satanella. It was after that
that the Bostonians got hold of the young
Californian, who made a stir all through
comic opera land in "The Singing Girl"
and "The Fortune Teller." But this did
not content Miss Nielsen. Rumors, at
t lirst Incredulously received, came along
as to the little singer's intention to ad- j
â¢ venture into grand opera. Mancinelli

the step. One heard of her then at Rome, j
her voice in charge of Henry Russell, the
famous maestro of singing, upon whom
the Saint Cecilia Society of Ronw be
stowed the only degree ever jriven to a
foreigner. In Naples one heard of her
again, singing in "Don Pasquale." in |
. which she sings here on Tuesday night. ]
it was said with success. Like word came
.â¢ifterward from Milan. Then London.
1 !\u25ba Miss Nielsen's success in London, in
particular, as Zcrlina in "Don Giovanni,"
seems to have been unquestioned. The
freshness and purity of the voice, its easy
production, the charm and piquancy of j
' -the little singer's acting, were, all sub
jects of the most favorable comment. Her
home tour, beginning in New York, has
â¢ not occasioned any great furor so far,
the American critic, to whom Miss Niel
sen spelt the piquant little comic opera
<iueenlet, not beinjr di^osed to take very ,
soriously her grand opera aspirations, and
jealous, possibly, of the undoubted loss
to comic opera. On Tuesday evening Miss
Nielsen appears at the Tivoli. and a
house already practically sold out will
be there to hear her. She will be singing
against the note, still brilliantly fluting
through the Tivoli. of Tctrazzzini. But
also, the little singer will be singing
alongside her own comic opera memories,
and to an audience proud of her and
widely prejudiced in her favorâ which
Perhaps scuare? the critical situation.
Mi>:s Nielsen's supporting: company is said
to be good, and includes Signorina Co
lombati, contralto: Signor Prati, tenor;
Fratodi, barytone; Articcl. basso: Rosa,
buffo; with Conductors Van don Berg
and BisaccL
The -organization is under the personal
direction of Henry Russell. Importantly
the opera will be again sung on Sunday
R afternoon next, which will give a chance
to those unable to get seats on Tuesday.
These will be Miss Nielsen's only ap
k There is nothing more like a "profes-
T:onal" than an amateurâ as some one
has said of the honest man and the thief.
It has this week, with the "society" per- ,
â¢ formarice of *"Thr> Merchant of Venice,"
been unusually difficult to tell them apart.
Even to the sacrificial playing of the Bas
*j=anio, with a freshlv-brcken wristâ Mr.
Dunn's recordâ the performance had a
peculiarly professional aspect. Naturally
Mr, Hotaling's Shyloclc, rather indeed the
* effort of the true debutante than of what
Is understood by "amateur." came first
In Importance. So strongly individual,
right or wrong, was the conception, that
one was hardly surprised to learn that the
nctor Jiad seen no Shylock since Booth's.
It was most novel in its importation of
a semi-East Side accent, and almost as
much so in the . frankly modern Hebrew
gesture so frec-ty used by the player.
These, setting Shylock of the race apart,
though occasionally perhaps detracting
from the dignitj- of the figure, distinctly
addi'd to the "local color." But Mr. Ho
taling's Jew has dignity, nobility, pride of i
race, in spite of its expedient servility.
!ts moments of cringing fear, Its heavy I
accent on the avarice of the character, j
Its cruelty. The detail of the perform- j
'ar.ee Is most interesting. The Hotallns
way of entering the courtroom, stamped
with a Jew's very reasonable fear of the
Gentile justice, for example. Is quite orig
inal. Yet It Is here the picture begins to
fade. The truth is that Shylock's mood
here is not one of fear. He is in his own
f'Ves an avenging angel, possessed of an
<>cstacy of hatred that casts out fear. He
is in no doubt as to the justice of his
claimâ it i? "an eye for an eye." and as
Incarnate justice he sees himself. It 'is
this exaltation, this tremendous uplift of
emotion, that one misses in the Hotallng
Jew. Moments of it there are, but as one
v^nse surge to the peak of the catastrophe
*-no. This, all, from the professional
standpoint.
The secret in chief that is still denied
the actor is that of sacrifice. The per
formance was more compelling in detail
than in mass, suffering in proportion from
the too deep accentuation of the earlier
Fcence. the "Hath not a Jew eyes?" and
the following bit with Tubal, perhaps the
best of the performance.
It needs not be said further that the
Hotaling voice lent splendor to the part,
nor that the lines were read with admir
able intelligence. Mansfield Is still safe,
however, so far as make-u?s are con
cerned. The other Richard acted over a
pretty bad one on Monday night, in par
ticular the pair of Beau Brummcl hands
that Mr. Hotallnjr owns, amiably Innocent
of disguise, lending everything but illu
sion to the figure.
Particularly fortunate, again, on the
picture side was the cast in Its Portia, the
Ftately Hilda - Clourh. Miss Clouprh, In
flaxen wig and breeches, red cap and
pown, was a rarely pretty picture, and
lier sweet voice and clear delivery
added much to the performance. Though
Shakespearean drama is probably not her
rnetler, yet the young woman showed a
pretty instinct for comedy of the modern
sort in the last, act tffat would probably
carry her a long way on the professional
etage. Mrs. Gerstle brought another
voice., conspicuously beautiful, to the part
RECENT PICTURE SHOW FAMOUS SUCCESS
Like a will o* the wisp did the Pic
ture Show of the San Francisco Artists'
Society at the Palace come and go.
And its rather unheralded coming
<and its unheralding passing) has
demonstrated that San Francisco is
really quickening to the sense of art,
and that it doesn't take a calliope to
thaw attention to a really high-class
exhibition' of California paintersâpro
vided the exhibition Is of convenient
location.
Even in the quickest of us there is a
dislike for the effort of overcoming
distance. It is a wise tradesman that
plants himself where people must pass
his door.
And with pictures the same commer
cial axiom holds good. Get your exhi
bition where the people most do con
gregate, and. ten toi one 3'ou'll sell.
Tlu proposition Is very easy- of eluci
dation â the bigger the market, the
better the chances.
The subscription plan exhibition, as
pursued by W. A. Leggat, has worked
out beautifully â so well that It will
p: obably become a fixed institution.
Bcheme has been explained be
fore, bnt it may bear repetition, . inas
much as it flavors so strongly of busl
ness â good business.
Subscriptions are solicited for the

intelligence to its interpretation.
Further of the cast one rarely gets a
better' Gobbo. son, than Mr. McKin-.
non's contribution. Hothead. Gratlano
was also capably done by Harry E. de
Lasaux.
John L Housman contributed an
other fine voice and one of the best
Autonios seen on the local stage, J."
Allan Dunn, the heroic Bassanlo,
afore mentioned, filled the , eye, and
gratified the ear and Mr. Rosborough's
ifOrenzo was as good. The mysterious
Charlie "Williams" also was a passing
fine Tubal and Frank Matthieu was
responsible for the adroit stage han
dling. Finally you could hear every
thing that was said and there were
more good voices saying it than I re
member in any recent, cast. If there
are acy more amateurs at home like
these oaÂ«i would like to know them. '

One does not like to learn that one
has disagreed with Sir Henry Irving â
even when one is Quite sure that he Is
l wrong. Apropos, I am sure Fuller Mcl
\u25a0 lish will not mind one owning this, as
I it was he whom the disagreement con
i cerned. There were 'those of us hero
1 who did not like Mr. Mellish's Gratiano,
i and some of us said so. Sir Henry
I Irving did, and though Mr. Mellish po-
I tently demands that his "dear chiefs"
j opinion shall be reserved for my pri-
J vate regard, I venture to disagree also
] with him. Mr. Mellish's note aneut
j the matter says. "For my own satis
| faction I should like you to know that
i eleven years ago, when I was re-en
i gaged by the late Sir Henry Irving it
j was for the part of Gratiano that he
[ selected me from all the juvenile lead-
I ing men in London, and I remained
i with him for five years. â¢ â¢ â¢ I
! have letters in my late dear chief's
j own handwriting concerning this, and
| containing unqualified praise of my
t performance. And, believe me, I al
| ways valued his praise very. \u25a0 very
highly."
Possibly it was an "off" performance
! that one saw â certainly Mr. Mellish's
! King Philip in "Don Carlo" as one not
j unhandsomely nor infreauently said,
' was a distinguished achievement.
REVIEWS OF MUSIC
OF THE YEAR. ,
A holiday gift that every music
lover would welcome is the Music Lov
ers' Calendar, one of the prettiest bits
of magazine making that has come
one's way. It i 3 the first of an Intend
ed scries of calendars, in magazine
form, printed by the Roycrofters for
the Music Lovers of Boston, and con
taining leading articles upon the year's
music of New York, London, Paris,
Berlin, by H. E. Krehbiel, E. A. Baugh
an, Louis Laloy, O. J. C. Lusztig. Then
Lawrence Gilman writes of the "Mu
sic of To-Morrow"; Baughan, also has
fascinating surmise concerning. "Wag- ,
ncr and the Music of the Future" â our
future, not the master of TBayreuth's;
Victor Herbert has a significant word;
Jacques Hartog "appreciates" Julius
Rontgen, whose rays are creative
.chiefly but importantly, also, interpre
tative, this chieiiy in chamber music,
of which the pianist is a .magnificent
exponent; Louis Laloy "biographs" Vin
cent dU^dy; Otto Winter Hjelm writes
of Agathe Backer-Grondahl; there - is
Henry F. Gilbert on Arthur Foote and
Arthur Farwell; Louis C. Elson on Ed
ward C. MacDowell and George W.
Chadwick; and book reviews.
Two highly interesting cadenzas to
the first and third movements of Beet
hoven's G major Piano Concerto, com
posed by Julius Rontgen, are not the
least unique of the magazine features,
and lastly, an excellent series of por- :
i traits of most of the folks mentioned is
! included. Almost every article ,Is In
j itself a reason for getting the - maga
i zinc. and its get-iip yet another. No
j music lover who lacks a friend with
! sufficient sense to send him the calen
dar can afford to keep half a dollar and
go without it.
Air. Baughan's article on the musical
i conditions in London is by long odds
I the most significant. Particularly Â» Is
! this true of the glimpse it affords of the
concert-giving situation In the me
tropolis. These are of the things Mr.
â¢ Baughan has to say here:
i "The artists who draw paying audi-
I ences in London can be counted on the
â¢ fingers of one's hand. The. rest play
| and sing here because London
|is a recognized musical center with
a competent and honest press, and an
artistically successful debut in London
may mean financially successful towns
in the provinces, and, perhaps, in Amer
ica.
| "The system of free concerts has de
| moralized the musical world. * * â¢
I The excess of concerts has had the ef
| feet of creating the chronic deadhead.
: If a paying audience cannot be found
\u25a0the concert-agent must fill his hall in
some fashVm or others. The best of
| the agents manage to attract an audi
| ence of musical deadheads, an audience
i which includes a number of well-
J known professional men and "women,
and it ia conceivable. that a new artist
may find them useful as peripatetic ad
j vertlsers."
Of the "weird procession of ill-dress
ed and'palpably .unmusical people" that
the inferior agents get together as
audiences Mr. Baughan then speaks.
Here Is his further, temptation to Lon
don concert giving:
| "The effect of this free concert busl-
show from lovers and promoters : of
art, said subscription to be the . pur
chase price of any picture In the , ex
hibition that is quoted at the sum
subscribed. For instance, A Bub
scribes J2O to the enterprise. When
the. show opens A hunts round for the
best $20 picture in v the gallery, and
finding one to his fancy, puts his fin
ger on it. Then one of the reception
committee hangs upon it the thrilling
word "Sold," whereupon three people
grow happy â Mr. A, â¢ the artist and
Mr. Legga't.
The exhibition that opened on Mon
day night and closed Wednesday was
far and away the best of Its kind? that
has been held. In fact, it sets a stand
ard whereby San Francisco, has a
right to demand of her artists only
the best they can give.
It is only .by discouraging loose,
sloppy work that conscientious paint
ers may . progress. Indiscriminate
praise retards the progression of .those
who get It and those who don'tâ for
it encourages the latter to lower their
standards. \u25a0///
In the recent show the work was re
markably even. A few / / abnormal
thing's crept in.but. they, were but: tiny
blots on the'marble, and not enough to
worry about.

who exhibited were: Henry v Raschen,"

San Francisco and tbo Pacific Coast will

ing the famous Nethcrsolc. By a singu
lar chain of Incidents Miss Netheraolc has
been thwarted on several oeca^io.is just
as she was about to visit the Far West^
Once It was a change of managers and o*
plans at the last moment; once tho
"Sapho" litigation compelled her to can
cel her Western tour; and the last time,
just as she was on her way to San Fran
cisco, she was stricken with a severe Â»H
ness-and compelled to retire froni the
stage for a year. Unless something un
foreseen occurs to prevent it Miss Nether
sole and her entire London company,
with four carloads of scenery, will visit
San Francisco for a stay of four weeks,
when **The Labyrinth" and her repertoire

! lately appeared there In "Rigoletto":
| "Then Gllda came, and a little whir
t ran through the house. A figure and a
[face with all the charm of girlhood; a
r voice that was all pure transparency and
I white virginal color. It was the voice of
! girlish musing and girlish romance.
I "Time and again we have heard Rigo

i the contrasting voices of youth and age.

Gayly Flows the Wassail Bowl
A YO UNG MATROX AMD TWO SMART MAIDS SEEN A T DOCTOR'S DA UGHTERS
"God rest ye, merry gentlemtn." will
Tins to the rafters of many a country
house to-day, while around the wassail
bowl the baron and his guests will grow
merry as of oldâ for know ye all that
to-day It is only the bourgeoisie who re
main in town to celc-brate Christmas â un
less indeed grandma be too old to be
moved from town, or there's whooping,
cough in the family. Of course, there are
mitigating circumstance s why some of us
didn't go to our country homesâ but we
look mighty lonesome and unstable.
There's no gainsaying that the posses
sion of a country home lends to a family
an air of stability. The occupation of
one at Yuletide, surrounded by a house
parly, quick to the pleasures and senti
ments of the hour, is to-day the hallmark
of smartness in America, even as it has
long been in merrie England.
And in California, where roses clamber
in at our chamber window on Christmas
morning, to give us greeting. It is not
strange that the custom has grownâ to
seek out the meadowbound country home
for the Yuletide pleasures. Rather
Is it strange that more people
do not go into the open, for there
â¢is golf, tennis, riding, mobiling, hunting,
boating, bowling on the greenâ but alas:
not roller-Ekatingâ to fill In the day; and
when the shadows fall there's the fore
gathering- at dinner, each full of the es
capades of the day, which probably is the
only port of dinner ever invented that
is sure to furnish every guest with some
thing to talk aboutâ and slice it's most ;
liable to center about himself, i-ach diner
erisos with the sense of having been beau
tifully entertained.
Then there's the big log fire in tho liv
ing-room, with its umber shadows weav
ing an atmospnero of kinship and ro
mance, where the plain little maid with
a low voice oecomes a regnant beauty,
and the every-day cnap a knight errant.
Stories are told, songs are sung, friend
chips woven, loves confessedâ sometimes
not wisely, but humanlyâ under the spellf
of Yuletide in the countrj' home, where
propinquity of genial spirits welds a
cable of magnetism. That is the essence
of Chrlstmas.\and its largest meaning.
Among those who are entertain
ing houbc parties at their country homes
over the holidays are the Joseph Sadoc
Tobins, the Rudolph Spreckels. Mrs. Fer
nando Pfingst. Mrs. Thomas and Miss
Amy Porter, the Russell Cools.
The Borels have hitherto played Santa
Claus to the people about their estate at
San Mateo, distributing, hundreds of gifts
to the working people: thereabouts,; and
who will, this year miss the visits of these
charming girls, who have perpetuated in
California a beautiful custom of the
fatner'e native land.
P. S.â lf you haven't a countrj- home
in which to quaff your wassail this year,
don't feel bad about it. You may have
better luck next. '

KISSES WIN GUARDIANSHIP ,
OF VIRGINIA M. POWELL
Lone Drawn Out Contest Is Bronjfht
to an End by a Child's AdmU
slou In Court.
A contested guardianship of a little
girl. Virginia May Powell, was decided
by Judge Lawlor yesterday. The point
at issue was as to whether notice to a
foreign guardian was necessary and
the Judge held that it was not.
Miss Mary A. Brackett, who conducts
a kindergarten on Oclavia; btreet, . ap
plied last January for letters of guar
dianship over the little girl, who. is six
years of age. and was sent froni Bal
timore to her school. The child's par
ents were dead and her aunt. Mrs.
Susan N. P. Cottman of Baltimore, con
sented that Miss Brackett should edu
cate the girl, but when Mrs. Cottman
learned that Miss Brackett had applied
for letters of guardianship she began a
contest.
Yesterday Attorney Bryan, on behalf
of the aunt,. asked'. that the order ap
pointing Miss Brackett guardian i be
set aside on the ground that Mrs. \u25a0Cott
man had not been advised of the* ap
plication. ; The child was ; questioned
by the Judge and said, \u25a0"I like ; Miss
Brackett because. 'sheV kisses , me^ and
auntie never did." The Judge thought
that affection was* more needed by the
child than anything else and "as Lulus'
found that thelaw Justified the former
appointment he wus glad to confirm it.
Mrs.rcottman V ls v the wife >of a
wealthy merchant of Baltimore and
tho child was \the, daughter; of the late
Humphrey Brooke . Powell,^ ; who -.for

UNIVERSITIES AND RELIGION.
THE Sacramento Bee brings against the two great California
universities the charge that they are infidel and atheistic. That
paper says that the Stanford memorial chapel is "an empty
shell so long as a general sea of atheism pervades the faculty, from
I,he president down." At Berkeley it is charged that 'Infidelity,
atheism, a denial of Godâ these are rank there. Stanford
is a private university. But what is done at Berkeley
is^ or should be, a Siate matter. The eternal divorcement of church
state is no more a necessity than the eternal divorcement of.
atheism and the state. If the taxpayers of California do not wish.
Judaism, or Methodism, or Presbyterianism, or Catholicism taught
their children at the State University, they most certainly do not
want them poisoned for life with rank atheism. They do not desire
that those bat-eyed guessers at Berkeley should rob the young souls
ci ever}' fajth that makes life worth the living."
As no plan and specifications are submitted, in the absence of a
bill of particulars we assume that these charges mean that science
is taught at the universities. It is ,an old, a very venerable contro
versy, and at every stage of it the same charges have been made
against institutions of learning. It originates in the pious idea that
the Bible is authority on the construction and physical nature of the
universe., revealed by inspiration. It was formerly devoutly believed
that in the book of Genesis we have a true cosmogony, and that the
world is flat, and the center of the universe, with sun, moon and
stars revolving around it.
Belief in that cosmogony was regarded as essential to salvation.
To deny it was denial of God â infidelity, atheism. Men of science
were burned at the stake and broken on the wheel for teaching that
the world was round, that it moved, that it was "not the center of
the universe, and that the sun did not revolve around it. They were
the "bat-eyed guessers'' of their day,, and as it happened that the
rival guessers in orders and full canonicals had the power, it went
hard with "the bat-eyed." But finally Magellan sailed around the
world and Encke's comet came back on time to a second, ;as mathe
matical^ foretold, and the "bat-eyed" had their inning.
s' : The church had simply made a human mistake, in staking God's
existence on a flat world and a geocentric universe. But the.cos
mogony of Genesis and its story of the palingenesis persisted. . It
was devoutly taught and believed that all animal life on the eart-h
noted in Adam's census and named by him was all that ever existed,
and that a pair of each kind entered the ark and survived the flood.
Good Bishop Usher favored .the world with his chronology, making
the planet a young thing, and the church again staked the existence
of God upon a statement of physical facts that had to be assumed,
Whoso called for proof was one of "the bat-eyed."
Finally men began to dig into the crust of the earth and to study
its structure. They found there, fixed in the sedimentary rocks, the
tracks and bodies of birds and animals that are like no living thing.
They found animals so large that one would have loaded the ark
belo\\\the Plimsoll line, and a pair would have sunk the ship. They
found evidences of a continued chavh of life, modified by environ
ment, with forms changing from simple to complex, or complex to
simple as might be necessary to prevent extinction, until the lower
and primordial types were lost and new appeared, fitted to the
physical age of the world as we know it.
As nothing of these things was found in the book of Genesis,
"the bat-eyed" men who found them were denounced as robbing
young souls of every faith that makes life worth living. The devout
believers accounted for* the tracks and innumerable fossil remains
by teaching that the devil had made these things out of mud and
â¢hidden them to deceive true believers and discredit the cosmogony
of the book of Genesis. Good and pious old Dr. Hitchcock tried to
reconcile geology with Genesis, but clearer minded men contended
that the Bible is not a scientific book and that the story of the crea
tion-,'Adam and all, is merely the first attempt of self-conscious^man
to account for the universe and his place and presence in it by an
imaginative and intensely interesting speculation, that is not scien
tific, and belief in which is not necessary to salvation.
We suspect that the guilt of the universities consists in their
teaching that Bruno was right in asserting the heliocentric and
denying the geocentric theory of the universe, and in-maintaining
the rotundity of the earth, and that Galileo was right as to the dual
motions of the earth, and that Copernicus was right in his theory of
the solar system, of which the earth is a member. /We suspect that
the universities are impeached further because they teach the facts
of geology and the origin of species as disclosed by evolution. This
being so, their guilt consists in taking God off a flat and motionless
earth, relieving him of responsibility for the puerile creation de
scribed in Genesis, and stripping him of the petty and detestable
Tmman passions and appetites with which ignorance and superstition
endowed him, and clothing him with the illumination and at
tributes becoming the. maker of the splendid universe which science
has revealed. The universities have just as high calling to the re
fining process as the ancients had to the conferring upon God of
attributes that we would not tolerate in our neighbor. -
SAN JOSE'S PARK.
FAILURE of the Alum Rock bond proposition to receive the
necessary two-thirds vote will be very generally regretted by all
the friends of our beautiful neighbor city. A majority of the
people evidently favor the authorization of the bonds, and that the
two-thirds vote which the charter calls for was not given is probably
more from lack of thought upon the merits of the measure than from
deliberate rejection after careful consideration. Certainly the pro
posal has received enough encouragement to show it is deserving
of a campaign of education that will bring out a stronger vote next
time the test is made.
Not to be willing to spend a reasonable sum upon the iYnprove
ment and preservation of that wonderfully attractive glen shows a
failure of appreciation of the treasure of nature's work which is so
close to the Garden City. It is one of San Jose's most valuable as
sets. Its worth in the esthetic ser.se would justify considerable ex
pense to maintain and enhance, even if the expenditure brought in no
return in money. Fair San Jose is surely rich enough to indulge in
some of the inspiring kinds of luxuries, and Alum Rock Park is one
of such which can be made more so by appreciative care and atten
tion. ' i
The improvement of the park, however, would almost inevitably
be more than repaid by the increase in the value of San Jose prop
erty and the volume of travel and general business. Any wise plan
of civic improvement is likely to have that result, and no plan of
developing the capital of Santa Clara Valley could leave out the
claims of Alum Rock Park. It has more of romance suggestion and
of power to gladden the eyes and rest the heart and mind than any
other thing of the city^s environment. It should be arranged so that
every little gladdening nook could be easily accessible, and walking
or driving to and amid its charms be made pleasant at all seasons of
the year. \u0084 \u25a0

CARRYING OUT
A THEORY
"I was interesting a visitor in the sights
of this city," related an attorney to a
Philadelphia North "American reporter,
"and while, walking along one of the
streets our conversation was interrupted
by the rumble of machinery.
'* 'It's a printing establishment; let's go
in,' I suggested.
"We entered and walked about unmo
lested in the maze of massive machinery.
"The employes placed huge bundles of
paper on high boards to be fed into the
presses, and printed sheets were . deftly
removed .from; the rear. The smell of ink,
the overpowering heat and unremitting
hustle were oppressive. On a bulletin
board we read: 'Only twenty minutes for
lunch.' 'No lay-offs this week.' 'All
hands on duty every nightthls week until
10 o'clock.*
"We hastened away from the confusion
and ascended to the floor above, where
hundreds of girls were engaged in the
bindery. There was no mirth nor chatter,
only the whirr of machinery..
" 'What job is it?' I asked of a lady who
apparently had charge of the department,
requires such hard work and so
many long hours of the employes in this
establishment?'
" "This house is getting out another edi
tion of the Simple Life,' she answered po
litely but hurriedly, 'and we must finish
It this week.' "
many had held the boards and the battlefield, but the- Democratic
disturbance is forgotten in the Republican mixup. It seems to
mean a new deal in New York Republican politics. Senators JPlatt
and Depew have lost their grip and no longer satisfy the party.
New men of greater ability have risen. Root and Black, Jerome
and Wadsworth, are the new -leaders, and the party aspires to hold
a stronger position for 'New York in the Senate than it has' had
since Conkling's fall. Of course the old crowd does not retire
gracefully. It has to be assisted and does not enjoy the help that
cometh from the hills. >v .,v
In it all is -the sign of partisan independence, strongly marked,
that indicates a coming realignment of parties. Groups in the Re
publican and Democratic parties are approaching each other, and
groups in each are flying off toward the new focus of socialism.
The old cries have lost force and significance in both parties. The
independence of the President has opened a new vista. to the younger
men of the country, and the past holds them in a weak and loosen
ing grip. ' Old issues are hull down and the horizon is ablaze with
new public questions of first importance to which new principles
of action must be applied. Of course the President is anxious that
his party in New* York shall reflect this change on the face of poli
tics, and it is probable that the weight of his, hand will be felt in the
reorganization. It would not be natural for. him to '; sit still; and let
his party in his own State remain in the hands of Senators who
have lost prestige in the insurance investigations; iand of an ex-
Governor who seems to be involved with them in transactions that
cannot be painted or seen in any perspective so as to make them
look right. ' ' Ussi

ART OF ELOPING IN FRANCE.
The art of elopingâ which in fifty years
will be perhaps considered as one of the
fine arts, who knows!â is particularly
French. .
Modern French lovers have kept the
romanesque character of their ancestors,
and some seem to regret the golden time
when young demoiselles and young
chevaliers escaped on horseback, . under
cover of , the night, from the old -and
picturesque manors, says a writer in the
London Mall.
On the other slde : of the Channel
"mariages de ralson," as\ they call them,
are much more , numerous than here,
where love is the chief | factor in arrang
i ing unions. When Cupid plays his pranks
|in French families he often disturbs a
I carefully built up scheme, and the long
j cherished "project of marrying Marguerite
to Monsieur Paul (because M. Paul has a
good ; position and Marguerite a respect
i able dowry) > falls down ;. like/ a : house of
j cards. The skillfully darted; arrow., has
I pierced . Marguerite's . heart, and Paul
may; try everything in order to please
herâ his case is hopeless, because Luclen,
who\ is 1 younger, smarter ' and less com-
I monplace, haunts the \u25a0 dreams of the
young girl.
Here is a deadlock. How Is this to be
overcome? In one wai^ aloneâ run away!

. Many French girls are educated in con
vents! a custom which, happily, is dis
appearing, not 1 " only because M. Combes
turned them out, but also on account of
thq narrow-minded and one-sided educa
tion received there; In fact, up-to-date
parents don't wish to see their girls roach
the age of 18 without having the slightest
idea of real life. But, as you can imagine,
\ convents, more than any other places, are
very often the scene of romantic elope
ments.
I remember a fetor years ago an extror
dlnary elopement happened in the south
of France, somewhere in the Riviera. A
young J girl of 19â the daughter of a Rus
sian -j noblemanâ lnvented a fine plot to
i escape from her convent prison. One day
her lover, al?Frencha 1 ? French artist, former pupil
at the Ecole dcs Beaux Arts, got a letter,
in which she .urged him to call at the con
vent and to introduce himself as the doc
tor of the prefecture on a. tour of inspec
tion. p^SS
7 The scheme was rather a daring one, as
the young artist did not know much
about medicine; anyhow, he did 1t..., A
farcical scene was acted, during which
the ; lover felt the pulses of a' couple of
dozen iof young girls, prescribing harm
less embrocations for some, "sweet syrups
or mustard , Dlastera for others. The
worst of it all is that he had to examine
carefully the old cook of convent.
Ah, if It had not been for his girl's sake!
He .was Just leaving the house, when cries
were overheard, and: two nuns rushed on
him and led him quickly to â¢ one of the
pupils'. rooms. She had Just fainted. He
at once .uttered a grave diagnostic and
said he would call again after dinner. So
he did, and as she was not doing better
he said : to the :'â¢ Mother Superioress, who
was all in tears :
i "This young girl is very ill; my carriage
is at the door, and I'll take her imme
diately to - the ; hospital ; l my responsibility
is at . stake, madame."
Ten minutes r later the . young painter
and the little. Russian gentlewoman drove
along: the.; road, to' Cannes;., arm : In arm,
overjoyed and; mad with; love! .
\u25a0 As a - matter of . fact;; young people who
elope nowadays are almost heroes; they
fight against social prejudices and ' vulgar
arrangements, where money plays the
main part, and they generally deserve all
our sympathy.. The light .hearted and
easily moved French , public is always
keenly interested in adventures of this
kind; . and is . always > ready, to look with
indulgence! at ! young couples whose only
sin! is to. love each other.
.And no w.I. have heard it whispered that
M. ; Santos Dumont. the celebrated \u25a0 aeron
aut, is going ; to ; establish â¢. in ; Paris "a pri
vate school whose pupils will consist
chiefly of unhappy; lovers.- He (the Gov

Of memories that you hold.
Sing me a song that Is sweet and

Of the coristmas days of old.
Sing of the eager heart and eyÂ«
As the season of Joy drew near;
And we marked the lessening days
go by,
When the sun ro?<* late In the winter
sky.
With never a backward thought or
sigh \
For the waning year!
Sing of the morn when our Lord was
born,
As It came in the days of youth.
When the bells rang sweet down the
village street
'Their tidings of joy and truth!
Sing of the drifted fields of white.
Of the crisp and buoyant air;
Of the country roads packed hard and
white.
Of the loaded sleighs and the faces
, bright.
Of the rosy girls and the laughter light,
>And the greetings fair!
Sing of the hall where we gathered all.
With never a vacant place;
Father and mother and sister and brother,
And each with a smiling face!
Sins of the thankful hearts sincere
For the board so nobly laid;
Of the boundless cheer of the garnered
year.
Of the ample toasts and the home-made

Of \u25a0' the stlngless Jest and the laughter

And the Joy we made!
Sing of the night and the rare delight.
Of the dance and the romping game!
Of the moments fleet, and the twinkling
feet
In the light of the pine log's flame!
Sing of the memories , now as keen '
As the poignant sense of love;
Of the berried boughs and the. evergreen.
The last cup round and the parting scene.
Of the last guest gone, with the miles be

And the stars above!

. "PRIMARY FACTS IK RELIGIOUS
THOUGHT" Is the name of a new book
issued from the University of Chicago
Press, and written by Alfred Wesley
Wish arc who was formerly fellow of
church history in that university, and is
the author of "Monks and Monasteries."
Although Wishart is here writtng of re
ligion in the most universal* sense in
wnioh he can think of and express it. it is
Mirprising how naturally and logically
th*Â»se primary facts in religious thought
liu> themselves with the personality of
Jesus Christ. The chain of thought
thitherward moves with that sort of in
cvitableness which is the essential char
acteristic of the greatest novels and
dramas.
It is also like the progress of the study
of Euclid, where, starting with certain
Â«xiom s which must be accepted, and with
some postulates which are willingly
granted, the mind goes forth via many
-. demonstrated theorems to far truths, the
recognition of which has gradually grown
out of the simple axioms at first willing
ly admitted. Beginning with a few basic
facts in regard to religion, which will
jirobably be acknowledged by all men,
the author makes it evident that religion
is the supreme thing in life, and pursuing
jhe thfme. to Its ultimate the supreme
necessity in religion is the knowledge of
Jeeus Christ.
Briefly the book leaves an impression
Vumewhat thus: Religion is the thine of
highest human interest. We cannot, how
< \or. Jove abstract truth: the thing must
â¢ *â¢<Â» clothed In a personality to enable us
really to love it. HrMgion is the binding
of man to God. The link of divinity to
humanity has its superlative Illustration
and pattern in the person of Jesus Christ.
So whether we accept the church dosma
. of his divinity or no, we are almost com
peU*d to believe that God speaks to the
race through the personality of Christ.
Thr> Jews are the race who had the su
jrrrrne mission "f giving religion to the
\vur!Â« in its btehest form. Jesus is the
>uperUtivo spirituul product of that race.
The divine in human is what reveal? God
to us and makes us love divinity and seÂ«^k
vo absorb '.t- So it seems clear that;
Christ is the largest primary fact in re
figious thought.
Wishart's* book consists of seven essays.
An Interesting way to examine them, es
pecUlly on the ove of Christmas, will be
vo .go through them serially and notice
the link? that lead up to Christ as if the
consideration of him were the prime lcs
s=on tha little volume has to give. There
may be other important threads to follow '
\u25a0 out in its weave, but this clew to the
workman's love of th<Â» Master and recog
nition of his teaching as the highest truth
will come, perhaps, the closest to get
ting straight to the heart of the book.
The flrst chapter essays that difii
ou4t thing, the definition of religion. He
â¢ docs It broadly to begin â making relig
ion th<Â» possession of all men-r-a uni
versal, instinctive human quality. He
assumes that there is a God. The men
who doubt or deny this he regards as
groping by means of their ideals, or
their sense of moral obligation, or even
their vagtke desire to get into harmony
with their environment; toward divin
ity. He QuotÂ«s John Fiske .as one of |
Uie choice inti-llectual products of our
timÂ»-. whose study of philosophy and
science led him to this: "The everlast- ,
ing sourc of phenomena is none other j
than the infinite power that makes for J
i tghtt-ousness." Religion in the broad
Sense is denued as man's actual atti
tude toward the universe. Whatever
that is. that is his religion. "It is this
univeic"al groping after God amid Uw
clouds cf mystery thut enshroud us
* â¢ which has produced every phase
of "the religions life. " lie passes over
the other two meanings given to the
word "religion," namely, a system of
doctrines, or mythologies and cere
\u25a0noniess; and the one usod when a cer
tain standard Is set up and a man is
tailed religious if he conforms to that
standard. He concludes the definition
< usÂ»-d for his special purpose thus: "Re-
Hc-jon may be taken to mean man's
Mutual inner life, viewed In its rela
tionship to God. in which experience.
uÂ»ouÂ«rhts. feelings and will are lndis-
Eolttbly united."
ThÂ«Â» st-cond essay is called "Religion
and Theology." The author asserts that
many people are not taught to see any
difference between religion and theol
ogy, and that it is a sad fact, well
known to students of history, that
crimes in theology have always been
accompanied by irreverence and relig
ious indifference, caused by the con
fusion of theological charges. Relig
ion, he says, is the fact, the object, the
reality: and theology is defined as the
organized body of knowledge concern
jug that fact. So changes in theology
do not alter the reality of religion. The
constituent elements of the universal
rÂ«-iigious experience of which theology
makes a. study are summed up in four
fact* â "the belief in God, the conscious
ness of Â»in, the longing for for-
Bivenesx, the attachment to some ideal
of character." The tenets of any sys
â¢ torn of theology exert a great influence
upon individuals and society. 'Our
ideas react upon the whole life. â¢ â¢
It is therefore folly to say that it
snakes no difference what we believe
hq long aÂ«* we are sincere.'* We find
the link or the thread that wo have
been following- showing forth in this
rtiaptftr In these words: "What a man
is doing with the life and the com
â¢ mands of Christ has much to do with
the character of his religion."
"Pelijsrlon and Morality" is the theme
of the third rhapter. Wishart tries to
treat this very liberally; but at the last
'we find that morality cannot divorce
itself from religion. He gives ample
recognition to the worth of men who
are strictly moral but who do not
recognize religion as an element of their
goodness. He gives the real reason for
this goodness by saying that the moral
n.an is partly conscious of God when
be is conscious of vital moral principles
nnd high ideal* which are grounded on
the I'ivlne Being. "He lacks that
which. In the last analyeis, is the ]
source of the highest morality, without i
which not only religion but mortality ]
itself would perish. That is conscious
fellowship with the Divine Father."
The fundamental question in ethics is
the ground of obligation, and God Is I
Raid to be that ground. In the effort I
to achieve moral excellence the value
of an ideal pattern is made clear. "We
cannot really love abstract truth. We
must love persons."
The rourth essay is about "Religion!
and the Church." That the church has ,
faults is frankly confessed. "The
church has concealed Christ as well as
revealed him." The contention between
various churches is also admitted as a
charge against them. This, however,
is true also of all institutions and so
cieties. "All brotherhood up to date
means brotherhood limited." "The
clashing of groups is a characteristic
feature of modern life." "It is true
that churches do not live up to their
Ideals, or to put it another and truer
way. the ideal is not as clear as it. will
pome day."
In favor of the church's use to re
ligion Jt Is said that all churches are
rooted in human needs, which is the
main propositJon to be considered. In
the friendship of those who are seek
ing the fellowship of God the mdi
vidual will find the social Influence
needful to a broad moral development,
it Is claimed also that the natural de
sire of the individual to serve hia fel
iow men requires the' guidance of tha
church to understand the vital condi
tions of true human welfare. Ameliora
tive schemes are abortive when carried
on without regard to man's deepest
spiritual needs. "Co-operation is the
nobiest achievement of civilization."
"The church is the mightiest moral
force in modern society." Wishart puts
in a plea for the church this way:
'â¢Noblesse oblige. The spirit of the
true knight and gentleman requires
(every man of influence and character
j to support those .Institutions which his
| tory proves to be essential to the high
1 est welfare of humanity."
In the chapter on "Ileligion and So
cial Progress" it Is shown that wher
ever we find the most exalted ideas of
God and the strongest desire to serve
: him there we "find also the cleanest,
I happiest and most prosperous society.
To rise toward the highest social ideals
' it is necessary to cultivate the love of
God and the love of man. Here Wishart
expresses his belief that God "gave his
best to the- world." He speaks of
"that love for man which found
its highest expression in Christ."
It is denied that there is such a thing
as individual morality in the sense of
a. private morality that has . no rela
tionship with social morality. Social
standards constantly influence the in
dividual.
"In the essay on. "Religion and Christ"
the truth is explained that life itself
is our greatest teacher; that no man
can reach satisfactory conclusions
about Christ by purely intellectual pro
cesses. "It is a waste of time to dis
cuss Christ" unless we are willing to
give "the personal effort to realize the
Christ ideal." "Would we realize high
ideals, find ourselves, think and love
and act as becomes the children \u25a0â¢â¢of
God * Â» â¢ let us emulate Christ.
â¢ â¢ â¢ this emulation is the very
nerve of society â the hope of the
world."
The closing chapter, which is on the
subject of "Religion and the Bible,"
passes quickly over the matter of mod
ern Biblical criticism to the firm ground
where criticism makes no confusion of
faith. "Its chief value consists In its
power to lead us on to forsake our sins,
to love mercy, to deal justly and to
v.-alk humbly with our God." , "There
is a uniqueness, an unparalleled sim
plicity, breadth and beauty of the reve
lation of God contained in. the Bible."
"The reason why the Bible is un
equalcd as a guide to man in religion
is that truth was revealed to the He
brews, and especially in Jesus Christ,
which was unrevealed to or undiscov
ered by any other people In history."

sus Nazarenus Rex Judaeorum (Jesus of
Nazareth, King of the Jews). The sec
ondary title of the work is "A Prisoner's
Story of ihe Cross." The prisoner Is one
imaginatively conceived by the author,
and very sympathetically and realistically"
is this conceiving done. The writer is sup
posed to be condemned to death for a
crime committed In the anarchistic en
thusiasm of believing assassination may
be rightly done for suffering humanity's
sake.
About the author: He was born in a
little Alpine village in Styria, South Aus
tria. He was self-taught up to his twen
ty-second year. He was too sickly ip en
dure farm labor and so he was appren
ticed to a tailor. He is now sixty-two, a
novelist, a poet, a Ph.D. in Ruperto Carlo
University, has had a medal struck in
his honor by the Austrian Government
and he is a Chevalier of the Order of the
Iron Crown. His best-known previous
work is "The Forest Schoolmaster." His
"1. N. It. I." extended his fame beyond
the Austrian borders to all the German
speaking people.
The romance of the life of Christ as
here told Is a mixture of the Gospel his
tory, with some additions of fancy, which
came under the influence of deep religious
feeling. The agony of the condemned
man finds relief in the writing from mem
ory of the story of the Savior. The
prisoner's mind dwells on the beauty of
the life of Jesus and on his wonderful
compasÃion. It Is the effective and the
only way In which he could gain comfort
and hope.
In the prologue some beautiful descrip
tions are given of the visions which de
termined the prisoner to seek his Savior.
One day he had read and prayed and
sought, but found nothing to relieve his
need.
"In the night that followed Konrad had
a dream, so vivid and clear as never was
dream before. It was a dark country,
and he had lost his way. He wandered
about among cold, damp rocks, but could
not find a path. Then his fingers felt a
thread; he seized it and it guided him
through the darkness. The land grew I
brighter and brighter; the thread brought
him into his sunny native valley â¢ * * I
and the thread to which his fingers still I
clung involuntarily led him into the room |
where it had been spun from his mother's 1
distaff. And there she sat and spun the I
thread, with her pale face and soft wrin
kles and kind eyes, and directly the boy |
stood near her she told him tales of the !
Savior. He listened to her and was a]
happy child. That was his dream. And I
I when lie awoke in the prison .cell, his |
j mother* gentle voice still sounded in his j
I ears: 'My child, you must cling to'
Jesus.' " i
In another beautiful dream he saw his I
mother come to him, saying she brought
him a friend. This new friend was a
vision of the Christ. "When he felt for
her hand she was no, longer there, but
In the middle of the dim cell stood the _
Lord JesrjÃ. His white garment hung!
down to the ground, his long hair lay |
j over his shoulders, his shining face was '
, turned toward Konrad."
An idea of the way in which the story
teller lets his imagination add to the
gospels brief outlines may be had from
this sample. He is telling of the call
ing back of the soul into the body of :
\u25a0 Rabbi Jairus' daughter: "Little girl! j
little girl! wake up,, it is morning." The j
mother uttered a cry of Joy. for the child 1
opened her eyes. He stood by, and^theyj
seemed- to hear him say: "Arise, my
child. You are too young to have gained
heaven yet. 1 The Father must be long
sought bo that he may be more beloved.
Go your way, and seek him.". Another
example is where he tells of the meeting
of Christ with his mother, whexKhe was
on . his .. way to be crucified ; on - Calvary.
"When he saw his mother his little re
maining strength nearly forsook . him,
but he managed >to keep standing. He

may wonder if. he will know when to
quit.. Still we can stand a great deal of
his sort of kindly preaching and no doubt
we need it, and the great vogue of his
first little volume may incline the public
to, listen longer to his didactics , than it
will to most other writers. His two new
' est books are "Justice" arid "The Gospel

this he goes onto show that Christian

Cor. uu 8. Wagner believes that our
current Ideas on the subject of work are
in need of modification. He makes the
worth of work the spirit in which It is
done. He italicizes that "there is no pity
in God's world for . him who does noth
ing"; and he holds that idleness, be it the
rich man's or the poor man's, 1% decad
ence, is death. .He thinks of a high kind
of, work, which the Christian, doing, re

Wagner's other new- book,- "The Gospel
of Life," is example of one of his favor
ite methods of work, namely to bring life

each, whereby; their force Is mutually
made vastly more. His ambition In the
book is to draw "from these equally in

better and fear death less." The little
volume is a' series of sermons from fa

is given according to the French version

From. Miss Ayer's culllngs I will recull
you a few samplesâ Just as reminders of
our wealth in friendships whereby we
can make more welcome in us the spirit
of Christmas. The author has divided
these wise sayings so as to show six
ways of appreciating friendship, namely:
The love of friendship, the companionship
of friendship, the sympathy of friendship,
the Influence of friendship, the Immortal
ity of friendship, the divine friendship.
In the division called the sympathy, of
friendship . I. flnd this wlierewith to start

more prettily pleasing expression of the
lovef of friendship than the following
lines, in which John G. Whittier makes

feeling of the heart: .

NEW APPLICATION
OF OLD FAITH, 'M
"Back to Bethlehem" , Is a new book by
John H. Wllley, which treats of modern
problems in the light of the old faith.
It takes as its motto this from Jean Paul
Richter: "Tha holiest among the mighty,
and the mightiest. among the, holy. Jilted
with his pierced hands empires off their
hinges, and still governs the ages."
Its aim Is to show that we must pass
through that dim shadow of. God and
good, which modern science has laborious
ly arrived at "under the vague title "the
power that makes for righteousness,"
back -to Jesus Christ and his definite
teaching about the power being a heav
enly Father. In the chapter called "The
Service of God," the author says: "We
arc doing every day that which would
have been a miracle in the days of Chrys
ostom or Peter the, Hermit.. We are los
ing the sense of -wonder. No one knows
what will be possible to-morrow. We no
longer prove; the deity of Jesus by his
miracles. Given 1 his deity we expect the
miracles \o follqgK.-^They become dis
tinctions, rather ,than^credentials."
The gist of the may be got
from the following > extract, which is
taken from the essay called "The Gospel
of a Person": >jc \u25a0-\u25a0}
"The power, which is to transform the
race is not abstract, but concrete. It is
not subscription to a' creed nor obedi
ence to a law, nor indorsement of a sys
tem of morals. It Is devotion to a Per
fcon. 'For I krow whom I have believed*
is the first Apostles' creed. And herein
lies the secret; of a victory: a Person,
real, live, substantial, potential, the ex
ponent of truth, the substance of law, the
personification of love; a 'who' instead
of a 'what'; a man instead of a method;
a being who is himself afl that we ought
to be. This U the need of modern theol
ogy/ and this need Is met in Jesus
Christ." '
A chapter 'such as that shows a belief
that when Christ said, not "I show you
the way," but "I am the way," he meant
some very definite distinction between
himself and the other, prophets by the
use of that form of expression.

BOOK ABOUT JESUS
FOR BOYS.
"The Boys' Life of Christ." by William
Byron Forbush, author of "The Boy
Problem" and "Travel Lessons In the Ufe
of Jesus," Is a work designed to give the
life story of Christ in such a way as will
interest young boys in those characteris
tics of Jesus which approximate some
what to ideals boys may attain to by em
ulation: The tale is told so as to keep
to the truth of history so far as the act
ual words, of: Christ is concerned, but
there Is imaginative addition as to the
conversation of the people who surround
him. To give accuracy to this fiction part
the author has studied the â¢ Holy Land
and the ways of its people, and read
many books about the life of Christ. The
attempt has^ been made to state the words
of Jesus in (modern English.
There are a number of good pictures
In the volume, Hofmann's beautiful "The
Boy Christ" being the frontispiece. Oth
ers arc from the paintings of the greater
artists. The most interesting of all these
is the one from the painting by Ferdinand
Panwells, called V'lf Thou Seek Him." It
is of a wounded soldier, alone in the night
upon 'a battlefield.- In a shaft of light
reaching through the darkness the .vision
of Christ is seen, clothed in ' white,
crowned with thorns, touching the sol
dier upon the" shoulder.

Is made by Rev. â¢ Dr. Charles Frederic

who I finds ; the explanation jof this fact
not merely in Browning's intimate con

it which looks toward God." Mr. Aked*

Is a woman of destiny. This has beer*
amply proven by her brilliant, brief,
meteoric career as a novelist, and by an
other circumstance to be narrated later,
which makes a vigorous appeal to ona
phase of the human, mindâ the belief in
the supernormal. For the writing, with
out previous literary training, of novels
such as "The Circle." "The Masquerader"
and "The Gambler." all of them showing
in the highest degree the art of the skilled
narrator, is not quite a normal hap

As a little girl she showed no evidence
of literary genius, but was much given
to reading, being often discovered by her

to have been at her tasks. Up to the

meaning Is within the compass of this
tale which was. In fact, the germ of tho
book. When Mansfield was playing
â¢Henry V," Mr. Cabell was with the
New York Herald, and one night at a
supper after the play conversation turned
on Shakespeare's omission of FalstafT
from "Henry V," and thence on the old
story that Elizabeth had ordered him to
write a play showing Falstaff in love,
and how he evaded the order In the
Merry Wives of Windsor." It was con
tended that It was impossible to connect
Falstaff with th e notion of genuine love,
but Mr. Cabell wagered supper for tha
party that he could do it in two weeks'
time. "The Love Letters of Falstaff" was
the result, and Mr. Cabell was the guest
at a merry little supper not Ion? after.
In its original form the tale was a one

What are the chief differences of opin
ion between Darwin and Wallace? The
latter, naturally, wishes to answer the
question himself. Inasmuch as It is some
times asserted that he has given up the
most essential parts of the theory of
natural selection. In the book before us
Mr. Wallace declares that his only ma
terial differences with Darwin were on
four subjects, which he proceeds to con
sider separately. Concerning ?tVe"* origin
of the man, regarded as an intellectual
and moral being. Darwin's belief and
teaching were that man's whole nature
mental, and moral as well as physical,
was developed from the lower animals
by means of the same laws of variation
and survival. As a consequence of this
belief he maintained that there was no
difference in kind between man's natnre
and animal nature, but only one of de
gree. Mr. Wallace's view, on ths other
hand, is that there Is a difference In kind,
intellectually and morally, between man
and other animals; and that, while hi*
body was undoubtedly developed by the*
continuous modification of some ancestral
animal form, some different agency an
alogous-to that which first produced or
ganic life, and then originated conscious
ness, came Into play in order to develop
the hlsrher intellectual and spiritual na
ture of man.â Review. New York Sun. of

HUBERT DAVIES'
PLAY A SUCCESS
"Captain Drew dh Leave,"
Being Produced in London,
Wins Popular Approval
DRAMATISTS AT WAR
Lively Discussion Between
Henry Arthur Jones and
R. C. Carton Across the Sea
Sjx-cia.l Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON. Dec. 22.â Yet another big hit
must be re-corded for that uncommonly
f.-.cccssiUl young Anglo-American dra
matist. Hubert Henry Davies, and as a
consequence play-goers in America will
have lo wait a while longer for the re
turn vicit to the United . States, which
Sir Charles Wyn&hara hud planned to
make early in Januarj
. A while ago. when Ethel Barrymore
played his "Cynthia" over here, a con
% Jction gained ground that Davies had
lust some of his dexterity, for the play
was second-rate and a failure. But It
speedily developed that "Cynthia" was
not the latest, but a very early work of
the young playwright, and if any proof
v.ere needeu that the author of "Cousin
Kate" Is well up among the men who are
to be reckoned with it is to be found in
his new piece. "Captain Drew nn Leave"
with which Wyndham is now packing iiis
theater In St. Martin's Lane.
Oddly enough, both this play, and the
other navies comedy, which Wyndham
produced, "Mrs. Gorringe's Necklace,"
were slated by the criucs as "unreal."
but their success eeems to prove that the
young playwright ki.ows his public.
The "Captain Drew" of the present
piece is an old sea-dog with a strong
tendency for flirtation. One of the
guests at a country house, he makes
love to his host's wife "just for a lark,"
and not only wins her affection, but
falls hopelessly in love with her himself,
upon which, horrified at what he had
done, he flies from the scene and takes
himself off to sea again. Thus summed
tip it all sounds a little bald, but the
thing is done so deftly and Davies has
fitted Sir Charles. Wyndham and Mary
Moore â¢with such congenial parts that
an unmistakable success has been
scored at the New Theater. : â ,
<And that is why. instead of playing
only six weeks In London and then
! hurrying Â°ff to America, as he Intended,
Wyndham is staying on In the metropo
lis Indefinitely. He will have to leave
the New Theater soon, it is true, for
that playhouse is leased to Julia Neil
son and Fred Terry, but "Captain Drew
on Leave" is merely to be transferred to
the playhouse in Charing Cross road,
which b^ars Wyndham's name, and will
be continued there as long as Its popu
larity lasts. Meanwhile Wyndham's
American tour is expected to be made
some time during thes prlng, when the
Davies play Is practically sure to be the
attraction. \* -;â¢-.- \u25a0
Meanwhile, perhaps the chief topic
in theatrical circles here is the rather
lively spat that has been goinp on be
tween Playwright Henry Arthur Jones
and Playwright R. C. Carton,' in the
course of which some excessively tart
things have been eaid. It all sprang
from that famous interview which
Jones g-a_ve out? in America and in
which he said that the English stage
was given up to "tomfoolery." On his
return Jones stood for that statement
and added that since "Mrs. Bane's De
fense" no serious drama had scored a
financial success in London. -
Perhaps the author of "Lord and
Lady Algy," who has produced several
successful comedies in the last year or
so. had been a trifle nettled by that
\u25a0word "tomfoolery," anyhow he ven
tured to question Jones' accuracy â
\u25a0whereupon the latter offered to give Â£50
to charity If Carton would, name a suc
cessful serious piece since "Mrs. Dane."
Carton prompt.y instanced Plnero's
"Iris"' and "Letty." "The Walls of Jeri
cho" and "Leah Kleschna."
Jones' reply was to deny that either
VJericho" or "Leah" was a serious
drama, which he defines as "a study of
modern lifeâ sustained jto the inevitable
nonconventlonal unhappy end." He would
not be "drawn" as to the Ptnero plays,
for a perhaps obvious reason. As a mat
ter of fact. It was not understood that
either of them did more than pay ex
penses. Accordingly the argument has

LOCATE MINES
OF GREAT VALUE
Mexican Buscones Operate
Properties of Great Rich
ness in State of Sonora
GUARD THEIR SECRET
Refuse All the Offers Made
Them to Disclose Where
They Found Precious Metal
Special Dispatch to The Call.
MEXICO CITY, Dec. 23.â An interesting
account of the mines of fabulous richness
situated in the state of Sonora and which
are operated secretly by the Indians of
that region Is given by T. G. Gibson, a
prominent American mining man: of Te
pisco, that state. The Indians are called
Mexican buscones. Gibson said:
"A few weeks ago a Mexican of the
buscon class offered to sell me a consid
erable amount of placer gold,- .which he
claimed he had found within 100 kilo
meters of Tepisco, but he refused to tell
me where he had got it. Among this gold
was one nugget as large as an ordinary
sized marble. A friend of mine bought
this gold for $300 and a day or two later
sold it for $565.
"It is no uncommon thing to find the
buscones of that part of the country with
gold for sale. This nugget"â here he ex
hibited a piece of smoothly worn wash
gold of Irregular shape, about half an
inch long and a little over a quarter of
an Inch wide, with a piece of white quartz
running crosswise through itâ "l bought
from a buscon some three years ago in
Tepisco. He had several other pieces of
fine gold ore, but I bought this one sim
ply for the purpose of making a pin out
of it.
"About eight months ago a buscon
brought into Tepisco a muleload of silver
ore, which be sold for {260 to one of the
local ore buyers. All efforts to induce
him to reveal -the place where he ob
tained the ore proved of no avail/ When
he found that he was watched by spies
of mining men he went back on a little
corn ranch that he had in the neighbor
hood and th'erc he stayed until those
watching him got tired. About two
months ago he suddenly disappeared and
had not again been seen there at the time
of my departure, two weeks ago. In my
opinion he is again on the hunt for the
mine from which he got the ore. Or, if
be knows where it is, he is taking ore out
of It on the quiet, for he sold out all his
corn and realized on his other crops at a
sacrifice before he left. It may be that
he Is taking out denouncement papers. But
this I doubt, for an Indian of that coun
try rarely^ ever does that, for It means
the payment of taxes and, incidentally,
the revealing of the place where the mine
is situated. The Indian about there has
been so badly treated and cheated that he
is afraid of every one, and suspicious of
even the mining authorities, and in this
he has been in the right, though now
there is scarcely a district about; where
he would not meet with fair treatment.
But I have known of many an Indian being
bluffed out of his claims by some mining
man with money, and I am sorry to say
that Americans have been among the
bluffers.
"The silver ore which this Indian
brought into the town was an oxide, al
most jet black, running like a great seam
through a wide vein of hard lime forma
tion. I confidently expect that some day
this district will be discovered, and then
j look out for a boom. One of the pieces of
ore brought in by the Indian assayed
SISOO to the ton in silver and $1500 to the
ton In gold. Very little of It ran much less
The man who made the assay tried every
means In his power to induce the Indian
to tell him where the hidden mine is sit
uated, but the best he could get out of
him was that it was in the north at a
considerable distance from Tepisco and
that the whole region, which is on the
borders of the hot lands, is seamed with
veins of silver ore.
"Many people have beep seen on the
hunt for this hidden mine ever since the
Indian brought in tiQ famous ore some
months ago." \u25a0.--'' ; -- '\u25a0;
raged round the question ' whether "The
Walls of Jericho" 'and "Leah Kleschna"
are serious drama, and the rather heated
controversy between the two playwrights
leaves it unsettled. So, nobody gets Mr.
Jones' fifty pounds.'

EXPLORER MAY
LAND IN PRISON
Clergyman Accuses Him of
Theft of Gifts and Sup
plies Sent to Islanders
FACES SERIOUS CHARGE
Thomas Caradoc Kerry Held
for Trial for Larceny Com
mitted on the High Seas
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec 23.â When gome eighteen
months ago .Thomas Caradoc Kerry, a
wealthy explorer from Australia, ob
tained a three years' lease from the Co
lonial Office of three uninhabited guano
laden islands in the South Atlantic for
$375 a year, he thought that he had got
hold of a bonanza dirt 'cheap. But at
present his . speculation seems far more
likely to land him in Jail than to make a
fortune for him. After an exhaustive po
lice court hearing that has dragged along
for nearly two months he has been held
for trial on the charge of larceny on the
high seas within the jurisdiction of the
Admiralty of England. And indirectly it
is all owing to his covetously earning, to
convert those virgin ' guano heaps into
cash.
The three little islands which myriads
of sea birds have been enriching for. cen-r
turies are known as the Inaccessible,' the
Nightingale and the Goff. They belong
to the Tristan d'Acunha group. - Tristan
d'Acunha Itself, the parent Island, is only
twenty . miles In circumference and situ
ated midway between the Cape of Good
Hope' and the coast of j South America is
about the loneliest spot on the globe. But
it serves as a- home for some' three score
people toward whom the Colonial Office
occupies the position of a species of-ben
evolent godfather. So when the authori
ties there made the agreement with Kerry
they inserted a clause to the effect that
he should transport mails, supplies and'
presents for the islanders free of charge.
Kerry had purchased an old gunboat, the
Pandora, which he converted into a steam
yacht, and when, in September, 1904, he
announced his intention of making a trip
to his guano islands the ! Colonial Office
inserted an advertisement in several : pa
pers inviting all and sundry .who cared to
make presents to the Islanders to send
them on board the Pandora.
KERRY MAKES A MISTAKE.
The Rev, Frank Stone, secretary to the
Mission to Seamen, took the matter in
hand and sent out a number of appeals
to manufacturers and others asking for
supplies of foodstuffs, clothing, books,
etc. More than forty boxes filled with
all sorts . of eoods were , shipped on the
Pandora. Among those who responded to.
the appeal wasithe Duchess of Bedford.
She sent a , blc parcel of : books to the
Tristan folk.' Bearing in mind that they
are a primitive people, and that few of
them are able to* read and write, it is
rather interesting to note what sort of
books the Duchess considered best adapt
ed to thejr simple taste. Among those
she picked* out for them were "A Lady of
Quality," "The Broom Squire," "The Lu
natic at Large," "Folly. Corner," "Under
the Bed Robe," "Palestine Explored,"
"People of the Mist" and "Forgotten
Children." The Mission . to Seamen con
fined their selection to devotional works.'
Kerry had his own ideas of what" sort of
mental diet was best adapted Â» to the
Tnstaners, .and very likely they came
nearer the mark than j those of ; the Du
chess. But he made a' mistake in assum
ing that he had any right of supervision
in the matter. According to the evidence
he threw many of the books, particularly
the devotional ones, overboard. ' He told
his crew they, could help themselves free
ly to other* He allowed them the same
privilege with regard to', much of the
clothing. On. Christmas day, by way of a
joke, he rigged out his cabin* boy in fem
inine attire that some good-natured donor
had . intended for a j Tristan d'Acunha
belie. It is alleged that at St. Helena and
Sierra Leone he sold some of the goods.
He presented a portmanteau filled with
books to the library on the island of As
cension. v
VOYAGE A JOLLY ONE.
The Tristaners got only' a small portion
of the things that had been intended for
them, but in blissful j ignorance \of what
they had missed they were profoundly
grateful for the gifts they : : received.
None of the books that | the Duchess of
Bedford had selected with such painstak
ing care â¢ were among them, but - that did
not ' prevent Kerry . on his return home
from writing her I Grace a letter telling
her how delighted the island ". folk were
with the books she had sent them. >. ; ?
The voyage of the Pandora to Tristan
d'Acunha and back was a jolly one, but
some of the crew. talked too freely of the
good times they had had on board. Some
of their stories came to the Rev. Mr.
Stone's ears and he started an investiga
tion. To ; his horror he discovered that
many religious works which he had
fondly hoped would be the' means of guid
ing the islanders safely to a better, world
had been, consigned to Father.' Neptune.
He made charges against Kerry, with
the i result ' that . the , whole , story was
threshed out in a police court and the ven
turesome explorerâ he is credited with be
ing the only /white man who ever crossed
New ; Guineaâ lnstead of working . his
guano deposits has to remain In London
under heavy, bail awaiting his trial on^ a
charge that the law regards as plain
stealing.
ISLAND HAS A HISTORY.
Tristan d'Acunha, which is so seldom
heard of nowadays, once possessed ' a na
tional interest for Great Britain. : It was
in 1517 that the island was annexed, \u25a0 and
its seizure was a tribute to k the terror
inspired by the name \u25a0 of Napoleon. ' St.
Helena held him fast, but . the dread of
his escape led to the use .of Tristan
d'Acunha as a kind of watch tower, from
which suspicious | craft could bÂ» | followed.
With the death of j Napoleon in 1821 the
British soldiers ; were \u25a0 withdrawn, except
Corporal Glass and two \u25a0 of- his compan
ions, "- who '.. became the.: founders of the
present colony, in which there is a strong
admixture of negro blood.
The Island, remote and t small as. it is,
has had its history. -Twenty. years ago,
when the population was \ nearly a . hun
dred, almost the entire adult male inhab
itants were' drowned Jn a futile attempt
to board a : passing . ship. . At a later pe
riod they were threatened ; with being
eaten out of house and home by. a scourge
of rats. V But they fought' rats with ,' cats
and conquered. * According: to the last
missionary who 'lived among: them, there
are lots of ghosts;- on the; island. That
may be ;j one 'why, "\u25a0 since Ihe 'â¢ left

Makes: an Interesting Dis

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec 23.â 1n spite of : both
the length of time that has passed
since "Gulliver's Travels" was written
and the world- wide fame of that lively
work up to a few days ago it had never
been Â» known how Dean Swift happened
to hit -on its hero's ; quaint \ appellation
of "Lemuel Gulliver." A V chance i dis
covery by a 'British; Museum official,
however, has proved ithat there ! one*
was a real Lemuel wulllver : and that
Swift had undoubtedly heard of him
before he wrote the book that nearly
every boy has read. .

practically .in detail in the pages of

gard's best novel, which was written
fifteen years or more ago. It seems
that about 100 miles east of Lake Vic

surrounded by caves and called . Nai

whose outlet,' however, . always has
been a mystery. It has now been dis

MAKES A NOVEL EXPERIMENT
Ascertains the Original TVeiffht When

t ' Saorlans.
NEW HAVEN. Conn.. Dec. 23.â An
interesting experiment has lately been
completed at the Peabody Museum of
Yale University to ascertain the orig
inal ; weight when alive of one of the
great Saurians, the fossil remains of
which were found in the Bad Lands
of Wyoming by the late Professor C.
C. Marsh. An. exact model on a small
scale was made of the Saurian, based
upon the skeleton and 'usins the dis-,,
placed water test and. carrying out the
computation, the original weight was
ascertained as about 77.000 pounds, or
thirty-eight and a half tons.
The Peabody Museum owns the com
plete specimen of a skeleton and has
already: mounted the hind quarters,
which stand to a height of somewhat
more than sixteen feet, the Saurian it
self being about seventy-three feet
long. The museum also owns part of
a skeleton of a considerably larger
specimen, which has not been mounted.

W. Baker, Promi

Latter Drops From Sight, but
Will Be Implicated if

OAKLAND, Dec. Â£3.â Charged with the
theft of thousands of dollars of United
Btates pustofnec funds. Miss Lulu M.
feowtn, clerk at postofflce sub-station No.
I, Broadway, near Tenth street, was ar
rested to-night by Deputy District At
torney Barrett J. Brown, acting on be
hair of his mother, Mrs. Matilda Brown.
Superintendent of the station. The arrest
follows an investigation which has been
In progress for several daye by United
Etates Postofflce Inspector R. W*. Mad
dern.
The young woman made a confession
to-nght to Rrown and Maddern in which
shÂ» admitted a heavy shortage in her
Recounts.
Behind the unusual case of defalcation
kLes the story of a. foolish girl's unfor
" tunate infatuation for a young married
*nan of this city, upon whom, it is said,
Miss Bowen had freely lavished the
money she is accused of having appro
priated. That man, according to Miss
Uowcn's confession, is L. W. Baker, head
tot the Baker Printing Company, 426 Ninth
Street. Baker hi? disappeared and efforts
ef the officials to locate him have thus
far resulted in naught. He is said to be
fcway on a business trip. Ac soon as
the tJovernment authorities locate the
mining man he will be arrested as an
feceompiice of Miss Bowen.
OFFICIALS AFTER BAKEII.
The Postofhce officials have taken every
frecaution to apprehend Baker. The seal
tf secrecy has been placed upon the lips
bf every one concerned in this extraordi
nary case. First intimations of irregular
ities in the accounts of Miss Bowen, who
liad full chargre of the sub-station, came
a short time igo from the PostofSce De
partment at Washington. Discrepancies
tvere discovered in the money order re
turns of the ttation. The records were
carefully expertod and word was sent to
the Postoffice officials here that something
was wrong. Inspector Maddern was as
r!gned to the case, and within a very
few days the evidence of defalcation was
procured. Mrs. Brown, who has been the
tuperintendent of the station, and who
lisd named Miss Bowen as clerk there
fevcral years ego, was also apprised of
the situation. She placed the matter in
the hands of h<y son, and the outcome of
the investigations was the taxing of Miss
Uowen with the crime.
This evening, after office hours, the
i oung woman confessed her guilt. She
Cave the Inspector information which
Marred the search after Baker, only to
prove futile for the time being.
The methods employed by Miss Bowen
to carry her shortage long enough to
permit it to reach the amount estimated
have not been disclosed by the Postofflce
officials. The loss must be met by Mrs.
Urown. who la well to do, being a daugh
ter of the late Frederick Delger, the cap
italist, and one of his heirs.
HAD SUPERIOR'S COXFIDEXCE.
Miss Bowen, It Is understood- enjoyed
the full confidence of Mrs. Brown and
had handled the heavy business of the
station for years, apparently in a most
satisfactory manner. The station Is in
Ihe center of the retail business district
fend handles a very large money order
business.
To-night, at the County Jail, to which
Miss Bowen was taken, the shortage was
declared by Jailer Charles Clark to be
from $5000 to $7000. The Postoffice author
ities refused to give a specific amount,
faying they were not prepared to make a
definite statement in that regard.
Miss Bowen was appointed clerk by
Mrs. Brown about six years ago. She
sras permitted to retain her position
when Thomas T. Dargie, the present
Postmaster, tock charge. He is fully
brotected against a shortage, as Mrs.
Brown assumes full responsibility and
Vill make good the shortage of her clerk.

Special Cab> to The Call.
LONDON, . Dec. 23â St. Paul's Cathe
dral, Britain's most historic - place of
worship, was the scene of such a shocking
exhibition last Sunday that the London
papers, evidently out of sheer, shame,
told the truth, but did not tell the whole
truth. '
The leaders of the hungry and unem
ployed had given notice that a large body
of men would parade and attend the ca
thedral for afternoon service and the
ecclesiastical authorities prepared for
their reception and so did the police. At
a quarter past three, when the ordinary
service began, the visitors had not ar
rived, bjt a few minutes later, while a
prayer was in progress, the great west
doors, used only for state occasions, flew
open and an almost indescribable scene
occurred.
The tramp of hundreds of feet over the
stone pavements, hoarse voices of men,
shouting snatches of the "Marseillaise,"
the noise aggravated by shouts and blas
phemy and men scrambling for seats,
drowned the voices of the clergymen and
the choir. It was a religious service, the
impresslveness of which is unsurpassed
in any English church, transformed in a
moment into a veritable pandemonium.
After a while the visitors quieted down
and for a few minutes gave the clergy
a chance, but the service was not to their
liking, and when the anthem was re
hearsed they rose as if at a given signal
and made a wild rush for the door. The
police were powerless. Hats and caps were
donned, cigarettes and pipes lighted,
while under the shadow of Nelson's tomb
two disputants forught a pitched battle
within a ring which their admirers hastily
formed.
They packed themselves into a seeth
ing mass of discontent and shouted
themselves hoarse in asserting that they
would keep the red flags flying and In
trying to sing the "Marseillaise." The
red Hags were waved, a sort of compro
mise between a grui.t and a cheer rent
the air and the various leaders of the
men harangued their fellows.
While the demonstrators were thus ex
hibiting themselves about a hundred or
so who had remained inside were listen
ing to the sermon. Here the scene was
unparalleled for an established church.
The venerable Canon Newbolt ascended
the pulpit amid respectful silence, but no
sooner had he given out the text, "The
Kingdom of Heaven Is at Hand" than a
gruff voice' from the nave exclaimed
" 'Ear, 'ear, guvnor."
The preacher took no heed of the in
terruption, but proceeded in spite of the
fact that the early part of his discourse
was punctuated by many offensive inter
jections. â¢ ,
It was a strange sight, the great gaunt
cathedral, the bare outlines of its mas
sive pillars being just visible through
the shadow of the fast falling darkness,
with here and there an electric light
making a brave but Ineffectual effort to
dispel the gloom.
In the chancel a great blaze of light
showed up the white surplices of the
choir and the bright scarlet Insignia of
the clergy. The seats under the dome
were filled with silks, satins and broad
cloth, while behind the barrier that sep
arated wealth from poverty, reverence
from blasphemy, stood the little knots
of men, ill-fed. 111-clothed, ill-bred, some
lounging against the pillars, their hands
deep in their pockets, in many cases with
caps on their heads.
As the service finished and the bene
diction was being" pronounced- these
stragglers stole out of the church to join
their fellows on the steps and ostensibly
to parade their woes before the well
dressed congregation.

SCOEES OF REVOLUTIONISTS AlfE ARRESTED.
One hundred and twenty revolutionaries were arrested to

thirteen bombs. A number of officers and policemen were dis

TROOPS CAPTURE ALL THE BARRICADES.
The troops have occupied all the barricades. In one case they
fared on the revolutionists from the steeple of a church. Revolu

The Council of Workmen to-day granted permission for the

ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 23, 11:55 P- ni.â The situation

A telephone message just received says that the roaring of
machine guns, volleys by infantry and the booming of cannon

the upper hand/ although there are rumors that the gend

fire on the people.
According to this telephone message, which was .very con

rising of the proletariat at x 6 o'clock this evening, but Governor

The news of the terrible ; bloodshed at
Moscow has created a tremendous sensa

graver. It furnishes the necessary stim

Proletariat, and their leaders can be re

that their own "reports show conclusively
that the troops were deliberately ordered
to fire on peaceful- demonstrations in or

the only recourse lief t was to right back iv
self-defense. .
They also claim to have confirmation of

Tverskaia boulevard and placed heavy detachments of horse
and light artillery at strategic points.
The first scene of butchery occurred at 2 o'clock, when the
troops and the cannon, which were loaded with grape, fired into
a procession of workmen carrying red Hags and singing revo
lutionary songs as they swung into the boulevard.
Since then there has been almost continual fighting. The
workmen threw up barricades at the triumphal arch, at two
places in Trovskv street and at another place, but all were as
saulted and carried by the troops.*
The principal resistance was at the triumphal arch, the de
fenders.of that barricade being armed only with revolvers. They
held their ground for a time against* the machine guns.
One hundred and twenty student militia, who were sur
rounded at the Fidler School, made a heroic stand, defending the
place with bomb? and revolvers from a window. They killed
two officers and eight soldiers and wounded many more before
they surrendered, with a loss of five killed and thirteen wounded.
The outlying districts are reported to be in complete pos
session of the workmen, who are disarming all officers and po
licemen caught besieging residences.
The Chief of Police says that to estimate the total num
ber of casualties would be mere guesswork, but he believes they
will run into the hundreds.

FACTS IN NATURE.
Not Only Do We Get Inspiration From
Nature, But Health ta Wett. .
For people who are run-down and nerv-
ous, who suffer from indigestion or dys-
pepsia, headache, biliousness or torpid
fiver, coated tongne with bitter taste In
the morning and poor appetite, it be-
comes necessary to turn to some tonic or
â¢trengthener which will assist Nature
auc Help them to get on their feet and
put the body into Its proper condition. It
is becoming: more and more apparent that
Nature's moct valuable health -giving
agents are to be foand in forest' plant*
axic roots.
Nearly forty years ago. Dr. R.V. Pierce,
now consulting physician to the Invalids'
Hotel and Surgical Institute, at Buffalo,
N. V., discovered that by scientifically
extracting and combining certain medici-
nal principles from native roots, taken
from our American forest*, he could pro-
duce a medicine which was rr.arvelonsijr
eSciont in caring eases of blood disorder
and liver and stomach trouble as well as
many other chronic, or lingering ail-
ments. This concentrated extract of
Nature's vitality he named "Golden Med-
ical Discovery." It purifies the blood by
putting the stomach and liver into
healthy condition, thereby helping the
digestion and assimilation of food which
feeds the blood. Thereby It cures weak
stomach, indigestion, torpid liver, or bil-
iousness, and kindred deraucemeuts.
If you have coated tongtw, with bitter
or bad taste In the morning, frequent
headaches, feel weak, easily tired, stitche*
or pain in side, back gives out easily and
aches, belching of gas, constipation, or
Irrcjnlar bowels, feel fiaib.es of heat al-

which the "Golden Medical Discovery"
will correct more speedily and perma-
nently than any other known apent. Con-
tains no alcohol or habit-forming drugs.
All Its ingredients printed in plain Eng-

The sole motive for substitution it to
permit the dealer to make a little more

STATE OF SIEGE US POLAND.
_ _
Tea Province* Have Been Put Under
Martial Law.
j st. Petersburg; Dec. 23.â The Fin
n!.sh railroad employes have decided
against, joining tl>e Russian strike.
Trains have continued to run on all the
: lines out of St Petersburg to-day.
Meetings of every description, even
those of the "Law and Order party," are
! being prevented.
For the present the Imperial Bank at
Riga has been forced to cease gold pay
ments owing to the impossibility of ship
ping gold coin thither.
The fears that the revolt in Lithuania
will extend to Poland have become so
acute that Governor General Skallon at
Warsaw, acting under authority of the
imperial ukase of November 24, has de
clared that a state of siege exists in ten
Polish provinces.
Uhlans of the guard and the Empress'
Own Regiment have been dispatched to
Courland.
A telegram received from Riga an
nounces the arrival there of two bat
talions of riflemen and a battery of ma
rine guns.
It is understood that tho strikers' lead
ers in their- desperation have decided v
lesort to violent tactics and to blow up
the bridges and right of way of the rail
roads leading out of St. Petersburg. The
first attempt at the use of bombs, with
which the revolutionaries are well sup
plied, was made this morning. A revo
lutionist was about to throw a. bomb at
a passing patrol, which was escorting
non-union workmen, when it exploded,
blowing off the man's arm. He was then
taken Irto custody.
Several thousand Lithuanians who have
invaded the province of Vitebsk express,
according to the Xovoe Vremya, the in
tention of seizing the St. Petersburg rail
way and annexing the districts of
Rachitsa and Liutzin to the "republic of
Lithuania."
The waiters" etrike has begun in St.
Petersburg. Many restaurants are closed.
Confidence in the failure of the strike
was reflected on the Bourse to-day, which
fcr the first tim* in some weeks was actu
ally buoyant, with all Issues rising sharp

SPREAD OF THE REVOLUTION.
Half of the Baltic Provinces Renounce
the Otar.
RIGA, Livonia, Friday, Dec. 22.â Quite
one-half of the Baltic provinces are. ap
parently in control of the autonomists,
whose committees, which include in each
locality some of the most influential per
sons, are establishing provisional , ad
ministrations and preparing for the elec
tion of assemblies to arrange the taxes
and legitimatize the partitioning of the
Government lands. Russian garrisons oc
cupy the larger towns and detachments
of troops are operating energetically
against the smaller centers of the insur
rection. The aims of the insurgents are
to establish an autonomous state under
Russian sovereignty.
Although more than 100 post and tele
graph employes have resumed work here
all the telegraph lines running out of
Riga have been cut, presumably by the
Insurgents.
The Russian cavalry have found the
approaches to places held by the insur
gents set with entanglements made of
telegraph wires'.
Trains were running to-day, but the
order to strike was expected at any
hour.
All German and Austro-Hungarlan sub
jects residing in Courland and' Livonia
have been notified by the consulates that
steamships are arriving here to . take
them to their respective countries. The
Consuls urge them to leave the country.
A German warship will cruise off the
I mouth of the Duna as long as it is free

i forced.
! VLADIMIR, Russia," Dec. 23.â Owing to
!*he hostile attitude of the people here,
who attacked the houses of the railroad
men, the strike leaders would have been
torn to pieces had the troops not inter
posed. Most of the railroad employes are
working. Reports received here from sev
eral villages in the provinces tell of the
murder of agitators by . peasants, who
were enraged at their attacks on the
Emperor. Among the victims was a
youngs woman. The policemen, who tried
vainly to save an agitator In the village
of Nodol, were themselves torn to pieces.
OREL, Russia, Dec. 23.â At the village
of Fetkoi the peasants have killed two
revolutionary emissaries. One of them
was beaten to death and the other was
burned.
PIOTRKOW, Russian Poland, Dec.' 23.â
Owing to the spread of the disorders
martial law has been declared in the pro
vince of Piotrkow.
KOSTROMA. Russia, Dec. 23.â The em
ployes of all the factories here have
struck.
VILNA, Russia, Dec. 23.â The railroad
men of the Vilna-Baronovitchi and the
Baronovitchi-Byelostok lines are work
ing, but the Luminez-Romny and Lumi
nez-Plnlk lines have struck.
ROSTOFF-ON-DON, Russia, Dec. 23.â
Work has stopped on all the railroads and
street railroads here, and the printers and
the employes of several of the factories

of Sweden and double eagle of Russia,
the Governor General, in the name of his
imperial master, gave back the ancient
liberties to the hardy race of the North,
whose brave struggle against the Russi
flcation of the country has attracted the
sympathy of the world. The audience at
the palace contained many persons who
had suffered in exile rather than submit
to this. Baron yon Born, a marshal of
the nobility, who replied to the Em
peror's speech in behalf of his estate,
and M. Pekka, who spoke in behalf of
tho peasantry, had returned to Finland
since the manifesto was issued. Bishop
Praleery acted as spokesman for the
clergy and M. yon Pfaeler, a banker, for
the burghers.
The reolies of the presidents of the es
tates were cordial in vein, but each took
carÂ© to say that the imperial manifesto
was "accented as the restoration of the
original constitution and rights of Fin
land, guaranteed by Alexander I." At
the same time they added their assurance
that the Emperor might have full con
fidence of the loyalty of the Finns under
the regime of the legislative, executive
and Judicial freedom. , - .: >
Baron yon Born also took occasion to
say that "the universal satisfaction with
which the world welcomed the inaugura
tion of a new era for; Russia is heartily
echoed by Finland." and" at the conclu
sion of the ceremonies he called for three
cheers for the Emperor, which were given
enthusiastically.
Throughout the ceremony the best of
feeling was manifested, and this evening
there is a general merrimaking In the
city, the Socialists refraining from mak
ing counter demonstrations.
PLAXS OF REBELS MISCARRY.
Student* Fall In Dawn Attack Upon
Railroad Station.
MOSCOW, Dec. 24, 2 a. m. â The plan
of the armed rising of the proletariat
was to seize the St. Petersburg sta
tion at dawn on Saturday, take pos
session of the douma building, capture
the state bank and proclaim a provi
sional government. To the workmen
fell the task of taking the station, the
object of which was to prevent com
munication and the dispatch of troops
from St. Petersburg. The student rev
olutionary organizations were to have
captured the douma, building and the
bank. /
Governor General Doubasoff learned
of the scheme at a conference at tho
palace on Friday night and decided to
put it down ruthlessly. He also ac

SUCCESS AS AUTHORESS.
Her Books Are the la Ik of London and Are in
Great Demand by English Publishers.
HCXOARIAX NOBLEWOMAN' WHOSE STORIES HAVE WON' HER FAME AND
CREATED SUCH A SENSATION IX ENGLAND THAT THE LONDON PUB
LISHERS ARE CLAMORING FOR MORE OF HER PEN- WORK.
Special DiNpalch to Tl â¢> Call.
LONDON, Dec. 23.â Baroness Emmuska
Orczy, whose books are the talk of Lon
don nowadays, feels that her record
should be an encouragement to young
authors and playwrights.
"I had had no literary experience before
writing my first story," she said the other
day, "and knew nothing of the stage
when I wrote my first play, 'The Scarlet
j Pimpernel.' I had not the slightest in
fluence to bring to bear, and yet both
i story and play were accepted. I do not
think that the young author ought ever
to get discouraged as â¢ the feeling that
influence Is necessary to success."
"But yo*i probably had more trouble in
having your play accepted than your
j first short story?" was suggested.
i "Not a bit." she replied. "In fact, I
\ understand that the record of 'The Scar
let Pimpernel' was somewhat unusual. I
not only had no difficulty in getting the
play read, but \u25a0it was accepted by the
very first management to whom we sub
mitted it. I was then only a writer of
i short magazine stories, and with the ex
' ception of one critic, did not know a
soul connected with the stage."
And despite this "The Scarlet Pimper
nel" was written, .accepted, produced and
had made a tremendous hit, all within
nine months! , .
I But perhaps had the genius of this
charming English-bred Hungarian lady
been less brilliant or less versatile, her
scorn of the leading strings of Influence
would be less keen. As an artist she has
been repeatedly a successful exhibitor at
the Royal Academy, and many of the
leading magazines of a few years ago
give testimony of her skill in
black and white work. And now, to cap
the climax, she is writing. novels so popu
lar . that. London. publishers, even with
out her consent, are buying up all her
stray magazine stories in order to bring
them out in book form.
OLD STORIES REPUBLISHED. ,
An: odd result of this scrambling for
Orczy literature has been an impression,
that the Baroness has been writing at a
prodigious rate. One of her English pub
lishers recently complained bitterly that
the -booksellers had been warning him
there might be danger of overproduction.'
"Overproduction!" he exclaimed, "Why,
she has completed only one novel, 'By the
Gods Beloved,' this year. 'The Scarlet
Pimpernel' she wrote from her play last
year. 'The Emperor's Candlesticks' is. a
reprint of an old book that first Appeared
during the Boer war. And the very latest
bock advertised was routed out from an
odd corner in. her desk,.where it had lain
for. four years!" . . â¢ .
This wrlte-while-you-wait idea seems to
have reached America, although the first
of Baroness Orczy's books to be published
there only appeared In August. One large
New York, publisher recently wrote to
London asking .how? many; more. books
might be expected from her before the
new year. The truth, is, however, that
the Baroness Orczy, while . remarkably
versatile, is also a' very careful writer.:
"I live with my characters," she said,
"and love my heroes and heroines as de
votedly as ever, they \ love one another. I
cannot call themV to ' mind . at will .or
write out .methodically what they say.
Sometimes I am.idle for weeks .together.
Then suddenly comes the" inspiration . and
I can f hardly -work \u25a0 fast enough." : "^
Her ' romantic Â£ tendencies I are ' revealed
also jin the Baroness', preference Â» among
books! ..Volumes of Poe,,' Victor Hugo and
Georg Ebers are on \u0084her "own special
-bookshelves; \u25a0 and show i many evidences
of usage. But in the place of honor* there
stands a well-worn edition of Bret Harte.
"I love . Bret Harte best of. aIL" she said.
In speaking, aa In writing. Baroness
Orczy uses excellent English, with an
accent better than many educated native
Londonerp. This seems remarkable when
it is remembered that she was fifteen
years old. when she came to this country.
"I was born at Tarna-Eors, in Hun
gary." she said, "and am the last of an
old Hungarian family, many members of
which have served their country from
time immemorial in diplomatic and for
eign affairs. My father, Baron Orczy,
was a musician as well as a diplomatist,
and was for some time director of the
National Opera-house in Budapest.
BEGINNING AS A WRITER.
"It was intended at first that I should
become an artist, and In my girlhood
days I studied painting very seriously.
Encouraged by my old friend, Edward
Long, R. A., I exhibited several times
at the Royal Academy. I spent many
happy hours in Mr. Long's study watch
ing him paint, and sat to him for some
of his most popular pictures. He didn't
like professional models. One result is
that my. portrait might be found in
many of . his paintings, including
'Christ Preaching From the . Waters'
and 'Zeuxis at Crotana.' I ascribed to
the seeds sown in my mind by his bril
liant pictures of ancient Egypt the
thoughts that resulted in 'By the Goda
Beloved.' "
One o. the oddest incidents in the
Baroness* career was the almost acci
dent that led her to take up literary
wor... It happened less than six years
ago. She and her husband were house
hunting at the time, and were staying
meanwhile with a family whose chief rec
reation consisted in wruing short stories
and reading them aloud to any one who
would listen to them. One evening after
having heard one of these not over-brll-
Hant storks - exclaimed to her hus
band:
"If these people, who have never been
out, of their own circle can write stories
some of wh.ch are published, why
shouldn I who have been an over Eu
rope, and have -nown many people worth
knowing, be able to write, too!"
"Why shouldn't you?" he replied
was ..ie beginning of the Baroness
Orczy's literary career. \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0
The Baroness is at the present moment
writing a new novel, wu. ,* it is ex
pected, will be finished early' next year
Its name is to.be "Beau Brocade." It is
aboutâ but that must not yet be revealed,
for those who have . read the finished
parts declare ft to be its author's best
work.

The following statement was made:

Miss Bowen was recognized by me as
satisfactory, for responsibility rested
upon Mrs. Brown. When I took charge
of the Postofflce Mrs. Brown and Mlsa
Bowen were both at that station and I
saw no occasion to make any change."
It is said that Mrs. Brown took the of
fice in order to provide a position for
Miss Bowen as a matter of assistance to
the young woman. There wad no rev
enue from the position, except the salary
Miss Bowen received. It was most diffi
cult for the authorities to discover what
could 'have been done with the money
until Miss Bowen herself confessed she
had given It to a friend. That friend,
according to the report, lodged with the
police by Brown, is L. W. Baker, now
on record as wanted for a felony. Mrs.
Baker Is prostrated by the demand that
has been made for her husband's arrest.
_ Baker was a frequent visitor at the
station where Miss Bowen was employed.
He was seen there at 11 o'clock thi3 morn
ing by employes of a millinery store In
which the station Is located. He is 35
years old.
"OLD FRENCH ARISTOCRACY
DIES WITH ME," SHE SAYS
Closing; Hays of Her Life Made Bitter
For the Princens de Val
- -
moot.
vPARIS, Dec. 23. â "The old French
aristocracy dies with me." cried the
Princess de Valmont on her deathbed.
She was a bitter old soul, who, born
of a long line of uncontaminated an
cestors and married to a noble of
equally superfine strain, had, through
her husband"s death in financial difficul
ties to marry her five children to
"abominable persons" of high charac
ter, but with the blight of trade or In
dustry in their blood.
Her last years were made mournful
to her by this pitiful descent, and just
before her grandiose last utterance,
looking with a bitter smile at her chil
dren and grandchildren in tears round
her deathbed, she broke the silence in
the following terrible reflection:
"We have here," counting on her
fingers, "representatives of carriage
making, wholesale grocery, confec
tionery, coal- mining and the stock ex
change, and all grafted on the old tree
of the De Valmonts." "

SAY JURYMEN WERE SOUNDED
BEFORE THE COLLINS TRIAL.
Scandal multiplied on scandal yesterday
in the aftermath of the Collins trial, and
so much ill feeling and animosity has
been engendered that the case and it 3
various phases will occupy the local courts
for many days to come. Serious charges
have been made that George D. Collins
in person visited the men summoned in
venire to act as jurors in his trial for per
jury and asked them regarding their per
sonal feeling in the case.
What appears to be an attempt to tam
per with the men from whom the Jury of
twelve was to be chosen was first re
vealed by George E. Starr, who was one
of the jurors during the recent trial.
Starr is reported as declaring that he
\u25a0was approached by parties interested in
the Collins case and questioned regarding
his opinion of the guilt or innocence of
the accused attorney. According to a
statement made last night by Starr, he
was told that there were several mem
bers of the venire approached by the at
torney with the questions as to how they
felt personally toward the defendant and
whether they would five him a square
deal.
One of the men mentioned in this con
nection is L. R- Larzalere, a commission
merchant living at the St. Francis Hotel.
It is reported that Collins asked him for
a square deal and attempted to sound him
as to his personal prejudices in the case.
Larzalere is at present out of the city,
and Collins denies visiting any man be
fore or after the impanelling of the jury.
Starr personally would not affirm that
he had been approached, but.it may be
inferred from the statement he made
that there was an attempt to obtain from
him an expression of opinion regarding
the trial and regarding his personal feel
ings for the recently acquitted defendant.
No charge is made, however, that there
was an attempt to bribe any of the mem
bers of the venire. It is stated that the
visits showed that an attempt to commit
bribery would have been easy, as the
means* of approach were open to either
side, and practically no safeguards ex
isted until the twelve men were chosen
from the venire. Collins is emphatic in
his denial that either he or any agent ap
proached any of the jurors, either before
or during the time they were In the box.
EXIIAGED AT BYIXGTOX.
Collins is enraged over the actions of
the District Attorney in declaring that
the three jurors who held out for his ac
quittal were influenced by improper
means, and has prepared an affidavit
chr.rsir.g the District Attorney with con
terapt of court and requesting that he be
cited to appear before the court Tuesday
morning to show why he shall not be sent
to Jail for contempt.
Judge Lennon practically finished his
connection with the case yesterday, when,
after a strenuous talk with Judge Lawlor,
he refused- to entertain a bond of $15,000
for the release of Collins on bail and de
clared that he believed that the verdict of
the Jury was wrong. By so doing he dis
qualified himself from any further action
in the case, and the acceptance of ball is
placed with a local magistrate.
Collins attempted to secure his release
last night on the bailbond offered by him
and endeavored to get members of the
Apnellate Court or the Supreme Court to
grant him his freedom, but was unable
to.get together a majority. He will con
tinue the attempt to-day and confidently
expects to regain his freedom. "."-' -j
District Attorney Byington is still firm
in hi? opinion that there has been crooked
work in the Jury and maintains that hon
est men could not have arrived at a de
cision for acquittal unless they were men
tally deflciert and. imposed upon by dis
honest men. He asserts that he will probe
the' affair and endeavor to ascertain the
motives of the three jurors, N. N. Hick
man, Charles H. Hartley and^ James T.
Hunter.
HISTORY OP TRIAL.
The history of the trial from the time
the jurors entered the jury-room until
they were discharged holds the most
important phases of the case. Long be
fore the case went to the Jury the men
in the box showed a disposition to dis
cuss the aspects of the evidence, de
spite the warnings of Judge Lennon to
the contrary. It was noticeable at that
time and remarked upon later behind
the closed doors of the Jury-room that
the three men upon whom the suspicion
rests failed to join In these discussions
or conferences, and bore the appear
ance of men to whom the^trlal was a
passing show.
The attitude of one man in particu
lar became so objectionable before the
case went to the Jury that he was let
out of the consultations entirely. When
the Judge had finished his charge the
Jury was taken to the room and placed
under lock and key. Considering the
circumstances which have developed,
the wonderful self-control and easy as
surance shown by Collins while the
jury was out are now made plain.
When thÂ© Jurors entered the Jury
room Paul F. Kingston was placed . In
nomination for foreman. Kingston ex
pressed unwilllnsneÃS to serve and Imp

TROUBLE BREWING FOR BYINGTON
Serious cbarges are made that Gtoree D. Colllna in peraon visited several members of the renlre from which
twÂ» made the selection of jurymen for the trial of the attorney on the perjury charge. One of the men who la
believed to have been approached la George E. Starr, rrho served on the jury and Toted for the conviction of the
accuser attorney. AnothV* Is L.jH. Larzelere, n commission merchant. Collins denies the chnr S e. The defendant Is
preparing an affidavit charging Bylngton with contempt of court In accusing the three jurors who voted for his
acquittal of being Influenced by improper means.
FUNCTIONARIES OF THE LA^'^ I
WHO ARE AROUSED OVER MIS
CARRIAGE OF JUSTICE. j
mediately either Hartley or Hunter,
placed the name of Hickman before the
jurymen, and Hickman was chosen
unanimously.
The first ballet was then taken and
the result was somewhat of a surprise
to the men who were convinced of the
guilt of Collins. The voting showed
that eight jurymen stood for conviction
and four for acc,uittal. " The four who
held out were George E. Starr, Hunter,
Hickman and Hartley.
the argument that followed Starr
defined his position on the aspects of
the case, and said that, while he con
sidered the marriage of Collins and
Charlotte Newman proved beyond a
doubt, he was not certain as to the
filing rt the second answer to the com
plaint for maintenance. Starr also held
that the father was the natural pro
tector of his children and in his cir
cumstances of life would be better able
to care for them.
Furthermore, the juror expressed
doubt as to certain testimony of the
Newmans, whether the second answer
was filed at tho request of the defend
ant, and whether the State was justified
in bringing a civil action to the crimi
nal court for trial.
FIVE FOR ACQUITTAL.
The statements of Starr made an im
pression upon, the others, and after a
long discussion another ballot showed
that the Jury stood seven to five for
conviction. The fifth man was Charles
A. Carillon. After this result the dis
cussion waxed high \ and loud, but
neither faction dared put the matter to
a ballot. It was not until the pointa
raised by Starr were refuted by those
holding out for conviction that another
ballot was taken, and the result was
nine to three. - ;
After Hartley, Hunter and Hickman
had voted for acquittal they refused to
listen to further argument, and In the!
strained position ,that followed the'
jurors almost came 'to blows. Especial
resentment was shown by Juror Hartley
to .the actions and remarks of Morris
Feintuch, who was one of the most ur
gent for conviction, and only cooler
counsel prevented a collision between
the two men. For fifteen hours the
deadlock remained unbroken, nor was
there aught but a perfunctory attempt
made to break it.
In the earlier .part of the session
Hartley, -Hunter and Hickman, In re- v >
sponse to argument, announced , that
they were fully convinced that Char
lotta was the wife of Collins, and this
opinion was concurred in by the rest of
the jury. They | contended, however,
that they were not satisfied as to/the
legality of the second answer in the case
before Judge Graham, and refused to
listen to any discussion of the points.
JURORS DENY CHARGES.
An extended search yesterday finally
located Hickman at' his home. He de
clared that no approach was -made to
him either while he was chosen for Jury
duty or after he was placed on, the jury.
He added that had any one done so he
would have inflicted bodily harm on him
and reported him to the Judge. -He said
that he reached j his conclusion for ac
quittal by losing sight, of the , bigamy
i charge, upon which he declared he /was
not called to decide, and stated ; that thÂ©
perjury to his mind was not proved.
Hickman also denied that there was
any- approach made to Jiim through-: D.'
H. Bibb, a lumberman and formerly as T
sociated in business > with s Hickman. It
was at Bibb's; Sacramento-street home
that Collins lived with the McCurdys be
fore . his flight . to Canada, j Hickman' de^
clared that the state of 'feeling existing
i between him and â¢ Bibb precluded any,
possibility of an approach from ",' that
quarter.
Juror â¢ Hartley was interviewed by a
representative of The Call the night the
Jury was discharged: r ln t addition;; to
stating that : he" acted as his : conscience
prompted -Hartley,-. : declared that the
vote at â¢ first stood \ six ; to slx^ A This \ has
been proved untrue. Hartley also added
that eight of the twelve ! jurymen had
their minds made up for acquittal Just
prior to the time that Father Connolly
was called to the stand to testify, and
that the interjection of religion into thÂ«
trial caused four of them to. switch to
conviction.
James T. Hunter echoed -the state
ments of Hlckman and Hartley and de
clared that no one approached him at
any time. He would not deny that ho
had heard a rumor of such approach to
other members of the Jury, but could
not say who was the man or men. He
maintained that he reached the verdict
from the evid.ence in the case and de
cided as he thought was his duty.
LE.VJiO>' REFUSES BAIL.
Judge Thomas J. Lennon refused to
accept the : $15,000 bond offered for
George D. Collins yesterday by the
Aetna Surety Company. [In doing so
his Honor said that he 'had never ac
cepted a bond from a surety company
in a criminal case and; would not.
This ruling was like, a blow in the
face to Collins. , The man ,who did not
flinch under the relentlessness of the
prosecution or the seeming certainty of
conviction betrayed a trace of emotion
when this ruling was made. He paled
slightly and started, but in an instant
was tho same , composed Collins again,
lighting back with arguments and
technicalities.
District Attorney Byington asked
that the bail be raised to $40,000. In
making this demand "he said: "There
ars reasons which I cannot state before
this defendant why this should be done.
I will give them to the court, if neces
sary, but to make them known publicly
at this time would thwart the ends of
Justice."
Collins was waiting with Attorney L.
P.' Boardraan and Paul M. Nlppert of
the Aetna Surety Company. Attorney
Krouse and others interested in the
case were hovering in the background
when Judge Lennon entered to decide
whether or not Collins was to eat his
Christmas dinner in tho County Jail.
There was a light of triumph in
Collins' eyes. His troubles were prac
tically over, he thought. The bond was
ready and in a few minutes he would
step out a, free man to all intents.
"1 have' here bonds in the sum of
$15,000," I\q announced.
In an instant Distrjct Attorney-
Byington was on his feet, protesting.
"This man- is technically guilty," he
<ieclared./,"The jury by a vote of nine
to three v proclaimed itself in favor of
convicting him. Besides this defendant
has declared though the public press
that he has been practically acquitted.
;He declared that he intended to go to
British Columbia. I ask that the bail
be nxed at $40,000." .
"We would gladly raise $40,000 or
$40,000,000 if we could," replied Collins,
"but the bail is already excessive. I
believe that had the jury voted for
conviction the court would \u25a0 Have been
in duty bound to set aside the verdict.
This demand of the District Attorney is
preposterous.- If his request is granted
I will ask the Supreme. Court to reduce
the bonds."
BVIXGTON'S DARK SECRET. ,
"There are other reasons which' I
cannot give in the presence of this de
fendant why the bonds should be raised >
to $40,000," declared Byington. "I do'
not care to state" them before this de
fendant." \u25a0
"This is exceedingly unfair, this is
oppressive," said Collins.
Byington walked up to Judge Len
non's chair and whispered something.
Necks were craned forward, but the
District Attorney did not make :it 'a
stage whisper. . . %
"This court would not set uside the
verdict had the Jury; .voted for convic
tion," declared Judge Lennon em
phatically. "I believe that the evi
dence YvuM ample to warrant this de
fendant's conviction. There wast no
good reason why he should not have
been convicted. I place no credence In
his story that he went to British Co
lumbia for his health. I believe that
the District Attorney Is Justified In ask
ing that tbe bail be raised to $-10,000.
I am disinclined to accept the bonds of
any surety company In my own court."
Paul M. >'lppert of the Aetna Surety
Company Was questioned regarding the
nssets and liabilities of his company.
He replied that the latter were in ex
cess of the former, but that the eom
pnny was "arood^,'
"We arc secured against loss In this
case," Nlppert added.
\u25a0 "What seeurtiea were given fÂ» asked
Judge ' liCunon.
"Real estate owned by Mrs. MeCurdy
and Mrs. Clarice Collins," was the re
ply.
"I will accept cash bail for 910,000,"
declared Judge Lennon.
"We cannot raise that just at pres
ent," said Collins. "I have no other
bonds to offer.". â¢
The Judge declared the ruling was
final and left the bench.
Before taking? action in the matter
Judge Lennon became involved with
Judge Lawlor. in a wordy war in Judge
Lawlor's chambers over the question of
who was qualified to accept the bail
offered- by Collins. Lennon maintained
that his duties ended with the trial, and
Lawlor held that they included the
placing of bail. Lennon finally entered
the courtroom and ruled as recounted
above.
While this was going on Judge Law
lor hastily left the building. "Word was
brought 1 to Collins of Lawlor's depar
ture and he hastily arose and started
for the elevator in an attempt to inter
cept the Judge. A deputy sheriff, with
visions of a IJigrht to Canada- -before
him, immediately sprang after the at
torney and brought him back.
COLLINS SPEAKS HIS MIND.
Collins was in a confident and restful
mood at the County Jail last night. He
expressed himself as being pleased
with the present aspect of things,. said
positively, he was sure he would never
be convicted now, told of how he in
tended to secure his release without
further ; delay, and once' more paid his
respects to District Attorney Byington
and Superior Judge Lennon.
- "I have In ury office papers already
prepared; charging District Attorney
Byington; with contempt' of court," said
Collins; "and I am going to file them) In
Judge Lawlor's court \u25a0 bright and" early
on Tuesday - morning. ; -In my opinion
the District -Attorney /certainly was tin
contempt: of \u25a0 jhe court when- he I hinted
that i the ' Jurymen had been influenced.
: r v."I shall- also endeavor to have one of
these : three :; Jurymen . bring: -'charges jO f
criminal libel against Mr. 'Byington. In
my opinion he committed criminal libel
by .attacking; these 'gentlemen the way
he did. Were 1 in the position of any
of them I -would certainly take such ac
tion without delay, but as the matter
does not rest with me I cannot act, but
I will confer with them and do my best
to gret them to take steps in that direc
tion.
"1 fear that should my case come to
trial again before another jury I will
bo severely handicapped by the manner
in which the prosecution has conducted
this case. It will be hard to secure an
impartial jury apain after the manner
in which Mr. Byington has attacked
these tl/ree gentlemen.
"I will say again that tho District
Attorney and Judge Lcnnon have been
prejudiced us^inst me from the start.
I tried to show that the Judge had his
prejudice before the trial commenced.
My opinion" has not changed as yet.
Judge Lennon has been criticized by
able lawyers all over the city for* his
lack of knowledge of the law. I have
referred to this and to other short
comings of his in my argument and my
testimony, during- the trlil,
SAYS lIO\U IS DOXA FIDE. .
t "I think I am going to have a hard
time finding another Judge to sit in
this case, , if it ever comes to trial
again. I "know that Lennon is sick and
tired of the whole affair and wants no
more of it. It. was a harder job than
he expected when he tackled it first
and he was jjlad to have a chance to
wash his hands clear of the whole pro
ceedings.
"lie should have accepted my bond.
It was duly certified and- bona fide in,
every respect. I even went to Judge
Cook and had him indorse it. Judgo
Cook said if the case were in Iris court
he certainly would have accepted the
bond and allowed my release from jail.
Lennon accepted a bond from the same
surety company when I was released
from custody before, and I cannot^un
derstand how he can refuse it this time,
for the law says that when a nuua is
arrested on a criminal charge he is en
titled to Ills release provided a proper
bond is f urnished. I j havo furnished
sucli a bond, indorsed by another Supe
rior Judge of this city.
"Every man on that jury Is an utter
stranger to me. I never met one of
them, either socially or in a business
way. I defy any one to prove that I
ever had any business relations with
any of these jurymen. I never appeared
for Mr. Hartley's father or himself
when they needed the aid of a hawyer,
and, further, I will state that I never
had a client named Hartley since I have
been practicing law in this city.
"I feel easier now than at any other
time during my trial, for I know the
worst is over. lam not ready to state
what my future plans will be, but I
will have some surprises to spring be
fore very long. I have been handi
capped for lack of time, but there is
lots of time coming."
MOBS LYNCH STRIKE AGITATORS.
Villagers Oppose Spreading: of j Work
. ingnien'H Propaganda.
vST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 23.-1:20 p. m.â
Telephone messages from Moscow say
that 150,000 men are on strike there: that
the city is already feeling the pinch of
hunger; that many bakeries have been
sacked and that all business is suspended.
Even the banks are closed. The Im
perial Bank, after standing . a run until
2 o'clock yesterday afternoon, shut its
doors on account of lack of light.
The casualties at Moscow yesterday are
estimated at 150. In addition wholesale
arrests were made.
From the small towns along the rail
roads come reports of .attacks on rail
road men. At Elnla seven families were
butchered ' and two , delegates were
lynched, near Kursk. . The organ of the
Moscow workmen has appealed to the
men to avoid assuming an aggressive at
titude, saying that even if the troops fire
"wait the signal for armed "resistance."
Here in St. Petersburg several col
lisions between workmen and the troops
have occurred in which several of the
former were killed or wounded and many
agitators were arrested at their lodgings
during the night. With the exception of
the official organs only the Novoe Vremj-a
and Slovo appeared. The former con
tinues Its provocative attitude toward the
Jews, sarcastically referring to the "sec
ond â¢ day of the revolution . so solemnly
and stupidly proclaimed by the Russian
Jewish agitators."
Nemechaieff, the Minister of Communi
cations, has received a telegram from
the employes of his old road, the South
western, saying they will keep the sys
tem open.
WOMEN' FEELTHE KXOUT.
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 23 (mid
night).âLate to-night, after' an order
had been issued to the,prefects forbid
ding meetings of any description, public
or private, Cossacks and troops cleared
the Nevsky and . Moskai prospects and
other thoroughfares. In many places
the. Cossacks^used their knouts freely,
even on women. It is believed that a
state of siege will be declared in St.
Petersburg to-morrow. â¢ ili'\:i-<

In the Cosy Apartments of the Club an
Evenlug of Good fellowship
Is Enjoyed.
Around the Christmas tree in good
old home-like fashion, with plenty of
wit and talent, the members of tho
Press Club gathered last night in their
cozy club rooms and welcomed Christ
mas. Refreshments served to make
goodfellowship: reign throughout, and
all agreed it was a rattling good even
ing.
A few. preliminary . remarks by the
president, , John , McNaught, who re
viewed in an intensely interesting man
ner the pride Californians take in their
native Christmas tree, and the trees the
people of other countries worship in a
like manner, started tho ball -rolling.
Here Captain "Billy" Barnes, who was
feeling in his best moouand .was some
what sorry that ' Christmas did -not
come ' more than once a ; year, kept the
gathering In high spirits.
Some good songs and a few . stories
were well received. Harry Perry, bary
tone, sang-a Christmas solo in a de
lightful manner. Mr. Onslow's rich
tenor, voice, was heard to advantage and
he had. a -hard time giving the crowd
enough, f \u25a0 Mr. S Dobson's racetrack story,
which ' "Billy" Barnes claims is the best
ever, was heard and all agreed" that
Barnes was right.
JAPANESE
GIVES BATTLE
TO BURGLAR
During Desperate Conflict in
His Home B. "Ivimura, a
Chicken Raiser of Millbrae,
Receives a Fatal AVound
BULLET IN HIS LTJNG
Armed With Ax Oriental At
tacks Intruder Who Has
His Money, and They Fight
for Life on the Floor
After a desperate hand-to-hand strug
gle with a burglar in his house, near
Millbrae, B. Kimura, a Japanese chicken
raiser, was fatally shot by the thief, who
made good his escape. Kimura walked
several miles to South San Francisco
with a bullet in his lung. There he se
cured medical attention. Early yester
day morning he was brought to the Mc-
Nutt Hospital in this city and last night
was sent to the Central Emergency Hos
pital, v'j -, -;>
The assault occurred last Friday, about
12:30 p. m. The Japanese conducts a
small chicken ranch. He was out in his
yard feeding his fowls and was attracted
to his house by the noise of some one
walking around inside. On entering the
building, he discovered a white man with
a sack containing various articles, in
cluding money, he had gathered up. -Kl
mura seized an ax and made for tne
thief. A terrific struggle ensued. The
Japanese made every attempt to dash
out the brains of the intruder, who
fought desperately for his life. Kimura
was infuriated at the possible loss of
his little money and valuables. The two
rolled over and over on the floor of the
small bedroom. Kimura endeavoring to
land with his ax, the thug warding off
the attempted blows and trying to draw
his pistol. j ~yi
In the dim light of the windowless
room white man and Jap battled for su
premacy. Kimura is 50 years of age and
his' strength was exhausted after the
struggle had progressed for fifteen min
utes. Finally, peeing his adversary's
strength gone, the burglar drew his re
volver and deliberately fired a ball into
the chest of the prostrate man. Kimura
made one feeble attempt to protect him
self with his arm. but the bullet pierced
his left lung, tearing a gaping hole in the
flesh. \.y â¢â¢,
Then the Jap says he fainted. How
long he lay in a stupor he knew not.
When he came to he discovered that the
thief had stolen $35. Kimura made his
way, though painfully wounded, to South
San Francisco. He was treated by Dr.
Palmer, who advised, his removal to this
city. J Palmer did n^t notify the San Ma
teo authorities for some unknown rea
son. Kimura was brought ' to the city
in an ambulance.
Last night the doctora at the McNutt
Hospital phoned to the Central Emer
gency Hospital and said that as the Jap
had no money they did not want the cas*.
Dr. Glover treated the unfortunate man
and says that his chances for- recovery
are slim. The police were notified and
they in turn "communicated with Sheriff
Mansfield of San Mateo County.
Sergeant Brown of the San Francisco
Police Department, to whom the report
of the shooting was made, did not know
whether he would send a detective to in
terview the fatally wounded man. He
said he would communicate with the San
Mateo authorities. By the time the
Sheriff arrives in this city the Jap may
be dead.

NEW YORK, Dec. 23.â E. A. Merritt
Jr., candidate for the nomination for
Speaker cf the New York State Assembly,
made a public statement to-night, in
which he said that "in face of repeated
demands for their resignation or removal
by people and parties of all sorts, tho
Governor has continued to extend over-
Francis Hendricka. State Superintendent
of Insurance: Frederick D. Kllburn. Stato
Superintendent of Banks, and George W.
Aldridge. State Railroad Inspector, tho
necessary protection of hl3 office power.
It is not to be wondered at that they
should cleave to the Governor." Continu
ing Merritt said:
"The President is said to be out for
Wadsworth. If it is so that he is taking
a part it ts not the first case of Prest
dential interference in tho politics of tho
State. Such interference has heretofore
resulted in disaster to the Republican
party of the State.
"The conference held here yesterday,
consisting of all the leading members of
the Assembly and about half of the Re
publican members-elect, by their expres
sions of opinion show clearly that the
action of the Governor Is most distasteful
to every man who has had any real legis
lative experience. For all disagreeable
consequences no one can be held respon
sible except the Governor and his kitchen
cabinet, -who have forced a false and
unnatural situation."
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.-James Wads
worth Jr. of New York.- candidate for
Speaker of the Assembly of his State, ar
rived in Washington to-night to spend
the holidays with Mrs. Wadsworth. who

Speaking of the campaign for the Speak
ership. Wadsworth said that he expected
to win, but could not add anything inter
esting to the situation beyond what is al
ready known.
"Mr. Merritt says he is in the race to
stay, and perhaps he is," continued he.
"I have no appointment to meet the Pres
ident and do not know whether I shall
see him or not."

SINGS PRAISES
OF OUR GIRLS
Famous French Writer Pays
High Compliment to the
Fair Daughters of America
INSPIRE THE INTELLECT
Francois Coppee Says They
Have Temperaments Equal
to Their Perfect Beauty
Special Dispatch to The Call.
PARIS, Dec. 23. â Francois Coppee, or
to give him his full name, Francois
Edouard Joachim Coppee, in spite of
a sudden, deviation into politics, is mod
urn master singer of France. Though
*i 3 years old, there is fire in his sad
eye and bloom comes back to his faded
cheek when ho is aroused by discus
sion, lie is a Parisian of the Pari
sians, having been born, brought up
and educated in the French metropolis.
Coppee has always been among the
aristocracy of intellect,' and was the
friend of Victor Hugo. Of late years
he has mingled with duchesses and
grand dames of France chiefly because
of his religio-political divigations; but
as a pout he has drawn his inspiration
from obscure misery and from ignored
virtues.
Copee can turn from an epic to an
a youth of 24, ho published Â»'Lq Reli
quaire" and he became famous three
years later when ho wrote "Passant."
A. subsequent work, "La Bonne Souf
france," indicates a sort of religious
revolution which went' on until now
he is enthusiastic, some would say,
fanatical, about religious matters. ;
Coppee can turn from an epic to an
elegiac at will and almost all the forms
of poetry have been successfully essayed
by him. He lives in an old honey
suckled home" in the Latin quarter.
There is a large courtyard in the front
and there is a big garden at the back.
It is a solitude within the city. His
unpretentious home is furnished with
books and pictures. One room is wholly
devoted to volumes that have been pre
sented to . him by a host of modern
writers. In his study there Is hung a
portrait of Pius X. There stands also
a bust of Paul Verlahie and a yet more
beautiful one of Leo XIII.
"Why do you live in this out of tho
way place. Maitre?" I asked.
HOME IN' LATIN* QUARTER.
"I love the quarter as Dr. Johnson
loved Fleet street. I am not happy
out of it.' I have plenty of space here
and to see the soft spring gradually
grow into summer in the boulevard
Montparnasse is a pleasure beyond
words. The old houses here are like
so many, friends of my youth. I have
never quite understood why poets and
artists should quit the scenes of their
first success and the sources of their
inspiration for the sake of participat
ing in a life of fashion., Besides, big
dinners and dining out generally are
injurious to intellectual life. Victor
Hugo was able to eat big dinners and
to work hard intellectually neverthe
less, but he. did everything on a big
scale anfl< was quite exceptional. Yes,
lie was the greatest, the most wonder
ful of lyric poets."
"Do you like the company of poets,
Monsieur Coppee"'
"Yes. They are usually good talk- j
ers and always congenial. There is a \u25a0
curious anecdote about Tennyson hay- j
ing paid a visit to Carlyle. The story :
goes that they sat all the evening and !
never said a word until it was time to i
separate. Then the poet said 'Good
night, Tom,' and the philosopher re
plied, 'Good-night, Alfred.' I doubt
the authenticity of the silence. I used

"OXXARD. Dec. 23.â Ex-United States
Senator Thomas R. Bard was so seriously
Injured In a runaway accident this after
noon that his condition to-night is con
sidered critical. Whatever may be the
ultimate outcome, it Is certain that he
, will be confined to his bed for two months
or more and he may never again be able
to walk without crutches.
Accompanied by his daughter, Anna,
Mr. Bard left his home at Huenerae this
morning for Oxnard, Intending to take a
train for Los Angeles to meet other mem
bers of his family. With them hÂ© In
tended to leave for San Francisco on the
Owl to-night, there to spend Christmas
with friends. His coachman was driving
a pair of spirited horses. About two
miles from his home at a road crossing,
a gang of men was working on -a sewer
ditch and as Mr. Bard was passing one
*>t the workmen threw a shovel full of
earth out of the trench, not knowing
that the team was passing. The horses
took fright and dashed down the road,
â¢triking a rut, the buggy was almost
t verturned and the occupants were
thrown out The former Senator was
thrown into the open ditch. His daughter
Â«*ruck on the loose dirt at the side of
Â£ ditch and escaped injury. The coach
i?:un managed to keep his seat and con-
Urol the team.
. When assistance reached them Mr.
T?ard was In such pain that he could
Jiardly talk, but he managed to direct
those about him how to move him. He
ordered his coachman to drive with all
; sslble epeed to Oxnard and summon
physicians. A cold wind was blowing
off the ocean and his daughter wrapped
hc-r heavy cloak about her suffering |
father despite his protests. He was laid
upon the ground with the carriage robes
and workmen's coats under him and
made as comfortable as possible until
ih<-. arrival of the physicians and was
then taken home.
The doctors found that he had sus
tained a dislocation and a fracture of
the left hip, a combination which makes
ttotb doubly perJous. The physicians de
cided to summon assistance and Dr. Lo
binper of Los Angeles was summoned.
He arrived to-night with two assistants.
It was found necessary to administer an
anesthetic before even an examination
â¢if the injured hip could be made. An
operation will be nr-cessary to reduce the
â¢fracture and at the came time replace
tie hip Joint properly in its socket.
â¢The surgeons decided to permit the pa
â¢icnt to rally somewhat from the chock
before attempting the operation. They
will remain with him throughout the j
â¢nijrht and if a favorable time arrives for
them to work they will proceed with the
operation.
Mr. Bard has been in feeble health for
lome lime and his ageâ he Is in sixty
fifth yearâ makes his condition all the
tnore serious. '"i/'*
The attending physicians were asked
Â£rectly to-night what the chances are
Jr Bard'e recovery. Their reply was:
"Mr. Bard's condition is serious, very
â¢ erlous. It cannot now be stated what
the result will be, but we hope for Ihe
best. Months will elapse before he is
able to leave his bed and he may never
leave it again. There is no immediate
danger, however, and we anticipate no
unfavorable change in his condition to

GRASS VALLEY, Pec. 23.â As John
Rafter, night watchman, in the regular
course of his rounds, walked into the
Citizens' Bank on Broad street, shortly
after 4 o'clock this morning, and passed
into the back court, between the assay
house and the bank proper, he was
startled by a noise. He turned to in
vestigate and ran into the arms of a
robber. In one hand Rafter held a pis
tol and in the other a dark lantern.
The robber tried to throw Rafter, but
failed, and the two struggled for several
minutes. Rafter placed his revolver at
the fellow's stomach and pulled the
trigger, but the weapon would not
work. Swinging his arm clear, the
thief came down with all his strength
on Rafter's head with a revolver and
knocked him senseless. In the short
time that Rafter was stunned the rob
ber escaped. He left behind him his
bag of tools and a "jimmy."
The, watchman says that the thief
was a Chinese, or at least wore Chinese
clothing. He came to his senses soon
after the fellow escaped and gave
chase, but could find no trace of the
would-be burglar.
Several times during the last year
robberies have occurred in the assay
offices of this city, but the thief has
never been found. There was no loss
in connection with this morning's at
tempt.

COLOR OF HUMAN VOICE
REVEALS THE CHARACTER
SCIENTIST ASTONISHES LONDON
Strange Discovery
Is Made by a
Woman.
Researches Prove
Correctness of
Theory.
Special Dispatch to The CaJl.
LiONDON, Dec. Â«3. â Reading charac
ter by the color of the voice is tho lat
est musical Bonsation of London. Mrs.
Northesk Wilson has seen the color of
the voices of various English notables
and recently lectured on them to a
fashionable May fair audience. She
says Beerbohm Tree's voice was a deep
red all the time he played the part of
Svengali, though his natural voice has
a. much pleasanter hue. G. P. Huntly,
the English comedian of "Three Little
Maids" fame, has a "charming green
voice," and various other stars have
different colored voices ranging from
pale pink to ultra violet. â¢.\u25a0â¢â¢-%
Mrs. Wilson, who has a recognized
standing . In amateur scientific circles
here, intends visiting the United States
before long to study the voices of
American raen and women of note, and
is especially anxious to get President
Roosevelt to sing a few notes for her.
6hÂ« says she could size him up and read
his innermost thoughts the minute he
opened his mouth.
COLORS SUOW CHARACTER.
TherÂ« are some very remarkable
features connected with character
reading by means of the color of the
voice. For instance, if your voice
turns out to be a pale gray it is a sign
that you have highly intellectual parts;
whereas, if it. should prove to be a spe
cie* of gaslight green it shows that
you have "religious feeling, tinged with
fear." \ Light green voices demonstrate
their possessors to be extremely adapt
able; brown voices show selfishness,
while a light purple bespeaks "devotion
mixed with affection.**
Mrs. Wilson, in her voice analysis,
deals a blow to yellow journalism, for
she maintains that yellow-voiced edi
tors have a 'low type of intellect.' All
philanthropists have the lightest kind
of pink voices.
Sir Oliver Lodge and other scientists
have corresponded with Mrs. Wilson
over her discoveries and seem to think
her theory lias something In it. It is
confirmed, more or less, by researches
recently conducted In Paris. It has
long been known that music has the
power oi forming geometrical and
other figures.
llrs. Wilson, working along the lines
of other scientists, has discovered that
voices not only have colors, but that
tbcfie colors betray character. She has
made elaborate studies of many types
of people, even visiting lunatic asjl'ums I
*.nd other institutions, where her re
\u25a0turches demonstrated the fact that
the same colors always attached to per
sons of similar disposition.
REFORM CDAXGES HUES.
A slnsulax phenomenon In connection
with voice character by colors is the
fact that one may reform his voice. If
a. person finds out that he has an im
moral voice* say a blackish-brown, de
noting malice and sensuality, he can
decide to rectify hia disposition. After
a. while, if he perseveres in the straight
and narrow path, his voice will change,
as his disposition also. After six or
eight months' hard striving toward
food he may be endowed with a pale,
reddish-pink voifce, which, according to
Mrs. Wilson, denotes high, unselfish af
fection, and then later on may even attain
to the philanthropic hue of pale pink, de
noting love for humanity.
Thus, it will be seen, the possibilities
of the new discovery are enormous. A
drunkard with a dark brown' voice may
t*Jce the pledge. If he keeps It he
will be rewarded by the deep blue hue
â¢i pmre religion. A Jealous person,
.with a rolce that looks like a patch
of burnt sienna, streaked with tongues
Â«X fire and struck by lightning, may de
relop a pale gray voice, signifying "de-
ToUon to a noble ideal."
"When Mra. Wilson first began to see
thÂ«oe colors proceeding from the voices
of her frienfls she sensibly thought
there was something: the matter with
her" eyes and decided, to consult a spe
cialist.
Mark Twain says, "When you see a
most count a hundred, and if it won't
Â»o away take a pIIL" Mrs. Wilson
thought her physical health was at
fault The specialist whom she con
sulted pronounced her perfectly well
and said there was nothing whatever
the matter with her eyes. â¢ It was then
that she began to study ,the matter
and to ascertain If there might not be
some scientific explanation of it. To-
Srether with Miss Watts-Hughes, Mrs.
"Wilson conducted a number of experi
ments along the line of making voice
figures.
UEOXIRES SIXTH SEXSK.
Other scientists had long admitted
the power of sounds to make impres
sions on external objects, witness the I
phonograph and other instruments, and '
Mrs. Wilson succeeded in demonstrat
ing; by means of a machine called the
eldophone that every note of music had
its visible form. Certain highly pitched I
notes made figures exactly like trees, I
while others formed flowers and vege- {
tables. It was found that certain notes
had the power to make the most gro
tesque forms â resembling huge snails
and other things. Vegetable growths, I
f*-rns, flowers, trees, shaped them- ;
selves as the result of musical vlbra- |
tlon. It remained then to be seen if 1
these notes could not produce color as \
well as form. :
It isn't every one, unfortunately, who j
can Bee these wonderful . colors that .
Mrs. Wilson mentions. You have to be
gifted with ii marvelous sixth sense,
which enables you to concentrate on
musical notes and see their color. Mrs.
Wilson thinks that the power to see
color is an outgrowth of a peculiar
force inherent in the solar plexus and
known as the kundalini force.
It is by means of this power that
actors, artists and musicians hold their
sway over the public. Mrs. Wilson not
only maintains that every .voice has it
color, but that each individual carries
around with t him a luminous aura, or
halo, which shows, what sort of char
acter he has.
PRECEDEXT VS BIBLE.
"Not only has every voice and sound',
its form and color," said Mrs. Wilson,
when seen at her home In London, "but
every person possesses the kundalini
force, and only, needs to develop it to
make himself famous. It is this foreÂ©
that inspires all art.
"People need not laugh st this power,
for it is one that has beeu recognized
from tbe very earliest times. Tho Indian

TION IN LONDON HY HEX DISCOVERY THAT THE CHARACTER OF PEO

mystics have long known of it. and called
It kundalini. I have lived in India many
years. The New Testament speaks of the
light that shone around St. Paul, and,
from the earliest Christian times, the
saints have been depicted with halos. In
modern times various scientists have rec
ogDlzed these rays. The well-known Ba
ron Reichenbach of Vienna made numer
ous experiments, and Bpeaks of fine rays
issuing: from every known substance, hu
man beinffs included.
"Through an attack of illness I was
enabled to see rays emanating from my
hands and fingers. By cultivating this
sixth senseâ this power of observing the
rays coming from the human bodyâ l was
before many years able to build up a
theory of these colors which I have now
reason to believe almost a. certainty.
MEANING OF TIIK COLORS.
"Through repeaied observations I have
found that the various colors, either com
ing from the voice when people sing or
from their bodies in the form of aura,
have the following meanings:
"Starting with red, if the color is dark,
it means that the nature is passionate,
irritable, unquiet, addicted to vice: one
of a low plane of living. Medium red,
liÂ£ht red and rose red are all improve
ments of the disposition. Light pink
means 2n?at sympathy. All philanthro
pists have very light pink rays. An or
ange ray shows that one is grasping and
ready to get on at the expense of others.
"Of green tints there are a large variety
of rays. Green is a bad color: it means
physical or mental disturbance. These
hues come from lunatics, persons very
ill, and often hypocrites. This mostly ap
plies to dark srreen. Light green implies
versatility, action, growth and progress.'
"Light blue shows religion and spiritu
ality; a quiet and studious nature; while
the deep blue usually belongs to the
scholar. Thinkers, writers and medical
men have deep blue rays coming from
them. Working class people are nearly
all of Hxht brown radiation, denoting an
honest and respectable character; where
as dark brown is a bad color, showing
depravity. The darker the brown, the
\u25a0worse the disposition. ' Light gray shows
fear and depression, while dark gray
exhibits actual melancholia. Out of seven
cases of lunatics examined psvehometri
cally two threw off muddy gray rays, and
five muddy dark green. Purple means
great intellect and intuition.
"And thus each ray shows its charac
ter. Strange to say. the fays change with
the character. I have known some per
sons with dark red raysâ meaning bad
traitsâ to reform; when, at once, their col
ors will change to light pink or blue."

all night, and early this morning he
heard a noise on the roof. Upon inves
tigation he found the skylight of the
adjoining building broken and a man
lowering himself into the building.

come out. Climbing up 011 the rope,
hand over hand, the man reached the
roof and started for Bonnington, who
retreated to his office, wheru the man
grabbed, a stick and beat Bonnington
until he was unconscious.- Policemen

building. He was finally taken after a
struggle.

Mrs. Sophie Rutherford, wife of the

STOCK MARKET
CLOSES STRONG
Moderate Degree of Activity
Is Shown During the Week
by the Leading Securities
COPPER SHARES LIVELY
Banking Insolvencies at Chi
cago Start Panic Among
the Smaller Speculators
NEW YORK. Dec. 23.â Operations in
the stock market were naturally cir
cumscribed by, the approaching' holi
days : and the suspension of business
on the leading; European exchanges.
There ,was, howover. a moderate de
gree of activityv^wlth , considerable
strength in a number of the better
known issues.
The bank statement aroused but lit
tle interest, but profit-taking gavo
the liat a temporary setback, from
which it only partially recovered. The
feature of the late trading was Ana
conda copper, which, on rumors of an
other â¢'rich lind" in the company's
mines, advanced to 216 and closed at
214, a net gain of 22 points. Anaconda
is a "quarter," or $^5 stock, however,
so its gain in points represents only
one-quarter that amount in dollars.
Total sales of bonds, par value,
$2,255,000.
The vitality of the speculation has
been demonstrated in the gains of the
week against obstacles that have been
sufficient to prove disastrous in times
ef past speculative movements. Bank
ing insolvencies in Chicago involving
liabilities of some $26,000,000 confront
ed the stock market upon its resump
tion of business last Monday. The sur
prise of this news was complete, as no
premonition had been heard of the
trouble. The very fact of the secret
having been so well kept, although
known to v circle of counselors, con
veyed an â¢ unpleasant Impression. The
shock to sentiment caused by the Chi
cago news, therefore, was violent. It
came also upon "a somewhat overex
tended speculative situation, . which
had already had some effect at the end
of â¢ the preceding week. Nobody was
surprised, therefore, to see a minia
ture panic in some stocks during a half
hour after the market opened on Mon
day. The effect had been exhausted
practically by that time. and. Monday's
clpsing prices showed few substantial
losses from those of Saturday. The
small harm clone to the stock market
by the Chicago failures is partly ex
plaineaXof course, by tht> prompt and
effective measures taken- by the Chi
cago Clearing-house banks^ to insure
depositors of the affected institutions
against lossÂ».
There were heavy, in fact, very
heavy, shipments of currency to Chi
cago from this point.. Up to the mid
dle of the week, also?*it was an open
question whether the resources of the
foreign exchange market would meet
the demand for remittances abroad to
meet the ; repayments to foreign
holders of â¢ our securities. With:*>tÃ^
foreign markets unsettled in addition
by the Russian situation, it was. feared
that gold might go out from New
York. This probability was ignored,
like all others that seemed . to, argue
against .the speculation. The great
center of speculation has been
Union Pacific. The dimensions of the
movement in that stock, the volume of
dealings and the persistence of the ad
vance point to extraordinary develop
ments regarding the property.
The bond market for the week was
quite' active and nuived in accord with
stocks. ,

COMBAT THE CLAIM
OF MRS. LEAFGREEN
Witnesses Say Her N Former
Husband Was Not La
ciede J. Howaigl.
ST. LOUIS, Dec. 23. â Arch Glover, a
stockraiser of Richmond, Mo., testified
in the Probate Court to-day in the case
â¢of Mrs. Mary A. Leaf green against the
estate of Laclede J. Howard, that he
had known Charles Howard. Mayor of
Tumwater, Wash., from childhood; that
he had played with him and_lhat he
was the man who married Mrs. Leaf
green at Palmer. 111., instead of La
clede J. Howard.
The attorneys for the defense say
they have six other witnesses who will
testify that the Mayor of Tumwater is
the . man Mrs. Leafgreen married.
Five witnesses have already declared
that the picture of Laclede J. Howard
is not that of the man who married
Mrs. Leafgreen and they have been
equally positive . that the Mayor of
Tumwater was the Charles Howard
they knew In Palmer, 111.
The first witness to-day . was Mrs.
Eliza Estell, formerly housekeeper for
Laclede, J. Howard. She said that at
the time Mrs. Leafgreen claimed to
have met Howard the family was in
Florida. She was positive that How
ard went away in February and that
he did not return until the latter part
of March. :'v?;;V^

EXCITING RUN
OF WILD TRAIN
With Engineer Unconscious
on the Floor of the Cab
It Rushes Through-Harlem
COLLISION ENDS FLIGHT
Coal Gas Overcomes Locomo
tive Engineer While Cars
Are Stalled in a Tunnel
NEW YORK, Dec. 23.â With the throt
tle wide open and. the engineer uncon-.
sclous on the floor of the cab, a heavy
New York Central locomotive, draw
ing &ix cars laden with stone, ran wild
through Harlem early on Thursday
morning and finally came to a stand
still, wrecked, when it crashed into a
locomotive in the Mott Haven yards.
Details of the accident became gen
erally known for the first time last
night through friends of the engineer,
Klvy Deyo of Poughkeepsic, vow in
the Lebanon Hospital, dying from
burns and ' scalds. Three men who
jumped from the train .in the tunnel
were lying unconscious at the track
side when Deyo last saw them. What
happened to them is a matter of con
jecture. The accident is said to have
been due to a lack of ventilation in the
tunnel.
A work train of sixteen cars left the
New York Central station soon after
daybreak. It was drawn by a gigantic
"pingpong" engine, j. The top of its
short smokestack clears the roof of the
Park-avenue tunnel by only a few
inches.
At Fiftieth street the big engine be
came stalled on a "dead center.'- En
gineer Deyo tried to get tho piston
moving by starting the exhaust, but in
spite of his efforts he could not get the
machine to turn a wheel.
The fireman and two brakemen in
the cab with Deyo began to cough as
the hard coal gas from the locomotive
firebox came pouring down upon them,
deflected by the roof and walls of the
tunnel.
As the engineer, still working with
might and main at the throttle lever to
get his engine moving, looked at his
three companions he saw them slowly
and painfully crawl down off the lo
comotive cab into the tunnel.
They tried to run back out of reach
of the deadly coal gas, but before they
had gone a dozen steps fell unconscious
into the ditch. Deyo's train was stalled
911 the main track, a peril to traffic, and
he dared not to leave the cab for a mo
ment.
Conscious of the danger too that he
might succumb to the fumes of the coal
gas, he wet a big bunch of cotton
waste at the tank and plastered it over
his mouth and, nose. .But the waste
was little protection. Deyo was still
trying 'to get the engine off the "dead
center" when his head began to whirl.
With a last effort of consciousness he
pulled, back the throttle lever. Just
then a pushing engine came up behind
and struck the long train and the im
pact started the locomotive.- The shock'
knocked Deyo, weak and dizzy, off his
balance and he fell to the floor of the
cab unconscious. With the throttle
wide open the locomotive gathered
speed. Deyo's body rested close to the
open door of the firebox and the flames
began to scorch him as they leaped out
of the furnace. All the way through
the long Park-avenue tunnel the train
flew. The switches were right and
the drawbridge over the Harlem River
was fortunately closed.
The train dashed into the Mott Haven
yard of the New Haven road and ran
into a light engine, on the main track.
Both locomtives were wrecked, and
Deyo was removed unconscious from
the debris. t

Literary American Wife of Bavarian

by Court Life.
LONDON, Dec. 2". â At the special in
vitation of the Queen, the Baroness Yon
Hutten lately visited Sandflngham.
Her Majesty, having read "Pam," was
much interested in Its author, who has
been gathering "copy" for a new story
in which a few well-known social cele
brities are to find themselves immor
talized.
The Baroness iÂ§ an American, while
her husband is Chamberlain to the Re
gent of Bavaria. . On various occasions
she has been invited to meet King Ed
ward, but she made the acquaintance
of her Majesty for the first time during
her re*cent visit to Norfolk. The author
of "Pam," however, makes no secret of
the fact that she is not "keen" on tho
royal set. 3he far prefers bohemians
and says she feels rather "out of it"
among royalties. She delights to talk
"shop" with novelists and journalists
and is far happier in an attic with a
crowd of what she calls "her own sort"
than in the smartest drawing-room In
Mayfair hobnobbing with duchesses.
Some one was saying the other day
the operatic stage had lost a "star"
through, her marriage with a German
Baron. She certainly has an exquisite
voice.

REV. FATHER MURPHY LOSES
CONTEST OVER PROPERTY"
Jury Decides He Unduly Influenced
Mr*. Catherine Blaolt to Deed
Valuable Realty to Iliui.
The Rev. Father John Pius Murphy,
superior of the Dominican Order of
San Francisco, has met defeat in his
effort to retain possession of two val
uable pieces of property deeded to him
by the late Mrs. Catherine Black. The
jury that has been sitting in the trial
of "the action instituted by Mrs. Mary
A. Slattery, a sister, and the children
of a deceased brother of the late Mrs.
Black, to set aside the deeds, reached
a verdict Friday in Judge Graham's
court in favor of the contestants. .
Eleven of tne jurors found against
Father Muryhy on every point, while
one decided tn his favor. As it only
takes nine jurors to reach a verdict in
a civil action. Father Murphy has no
Other remedy than to appeal for a new
trial. The jury found that when Mrs.
Black executed the deeds under which
Father Murphy nought to hold the
property she was of unsound mind and
yielded to undue influence exerted over
her by Father Murphy, who was
anxious to secure the property. The
jury further found that the deeds were
not, in fact, legally delivered by Mrs.
Black to Father Murphy, with the re
sult that no legitimate title vested In
him.
The property that now reverts to the
Tieirs of the deceased consists of two
lots, one on Clay street, near Baker,
and the other on McAllister street, near
Fillmore.

Rufus P. Jennings, executive officer

from the Secretary of the Interior, E.
A. . Hitchcock, in answer to the invi
tation sent the secretary by the Cali
fornia Promotion Committee asking
him to visit California for the pur
pose of Investigating the irrigation
question as relating to this State:
â¢'I am in receipt of your favor of the
Sth instant extending me an Invitation
on behalf of the California Promotion
Committee that I should visit your
State at such time as may be . most
convenient to me, with a view of mak
ing a personal investigation of the
needs for and possibilities of Irrigation
to be found there, and in reply beg
to say that nothing would give me
greater pleasure, nor from which 1
wculd derive more profit, as I am most
deeply interested in what concerns
California and its good people, but
more especially in matters relating to
irrigation. The results already accom
plished through private and corporate
enterprise in the way of irrigation and
reclamation are astounding- and you
may be sure that nothing will be left
undone on the part of the department
that will further such Interests so ma
terial, not only to the State of Cali
fornia, but to the whole country at
large.
"Meantime I shall be very glad to
have any suggestions at any time on
any pending Interests or those- that
may be developed hereafter as to what
the department can do consistently
with other obligations under the law,
and so far as Its financial resources
under the reclamation act will permit
to further the interests and wishes of
the committee." .^T'

IX O.VE SAMPLE OF MILK
Scientific Inquiry Shows How the
Lacteal Fluid Is' Sophis

A report filed yesterday by City
Chemist Glbbs on the analyses of eight
samples of milk demonstrated . that
some unprincipled dealers persist in
adulterating their cream with gelatin,
despite the publicity given to the un
lawful practice. A sample of cream
submitted by Robert Gallagher, who,
however, failed to state the name of
the party from whom he purchased it,
showed the presence of gelatin, and
when the guilty one is located he will
be prosecuted for the offense.
Some of the samples of milk ran
very high as to colonies of bacteria,
one from J. A. Wagner, and another
from J. Furrer showing 792,000 and a
third from a milk depot at 358 Third
street having 396,000.

ran over the field, winning first place from
Handzarra by a full length. The time was â¢
1:13 flat, three-quarters of a second slow

forced the odds down to -7 to 10. Hand
zarra, at S to 1, and Cruzados, at 7 to 2,
went almost unplayed. Miller had the
I mount on Cruzados and McDaniel on I

: VALLEJO, Dec. 23.â Local and . San
Francisco sports will be given an op
portunity on January 11 to see If Al
Neill, formerly rated as the "Pride of
California," is as good as he used to
be. He has signed to meet Joe Thomas
of San Francisco before the Palm -Ath
letic Club of this; city in the Pavilion
on that evening.
Thomas is well thought of here on
account . of his recent victories and the
handy manner in which he disposed of
Jack Clancy. Neill Is undergoing light
training and Is doJngconslderable road
work under the direction of Harry
Lewis, who used to: be with Neill when
he was rated as ; one of the best \on the
coast. Neill weighs nearly 170 "pounds,
but does not anticipate any trouble in
making 150 pounds at 6 o'clock.
. An explanation of the reason why paint

SOLDIERS SHUT
OUT JACK TARS
Uncle Sam's Boys in Blue
Are Handier With Stick
Than Pensacola Middies
SNAPPY GAME IN FIELD
Pitchers Toss Up Puzzling
Benders and Keep Bats
men Guessing Throughout
It is no idle boast that Unole Sam's
boys In blue can battle faster on the
land than thÂ« Jack tars. When the
Piesidio baseball team waÂ« through
with the Jack tars from the training
ship Fenpacola yesterday afternoon on
the Irepidlo field the latter looked a
shade worse than bustiers. The soldiers
won because they could clout the ball
now and then, while the Jackles were
not there with the stick. 43core, B to 0.
The game^was the first of the final
series between the army and the navy
and brought out a fair-sized assem
blage. It was fast baseball in every
round, with hits and errors at a prem
ium throughout. The jackies gobbled
up every chance that came skipping
along, while the soldiers erred three
times, "Teeley" Raymond making two
mistakes and Bertie Delmas one.
Both pitchers were wonderfully effec
tive. Hollander allowed the middles
bur two scattered hits and had almost
perfect control of the ball. Dennison
was nearly as effective, but he got in
wrong' during the first inning when he
passed two men and allowed a couple
of scratchy hits. After that he waded
in and pitched like a big leaguer.
Raymond and Garman, the first two
men up in the Initial spasm, were
passed. Raymond stealing cleverly. A
hit to third, which was all but landed
by Heine, brought Raymond in. A
fielder's choice and another blngle to
right swelled the total for the inning
to three.
Tt looked as though that would be
about all till the sixth, when Cusack
lined out a triple to left field and
landed on Stanley's single to center. In
th- eight Garman bit off a triple to
rig-l>t. and a passed ball by Ellis let
him through with the last one for the
day.
Both Raymond and Fair played fast
ball in the field for the soldiers, the
former taking several difficult chances
and falling down on two easy ones. ;
DenniÃon had ten chances and accepted j
them all without a mistake. The teams
lined up as follows: .H

CASTKL.L.AXKS EATERTAIN
THE KING IN BATHROOM
Turn fhc Apartment Into \u25a0 Roman
Bnnqurt Hall With Playing
Foantninn.
PARIS, Dec. 23.â 1t was in the bath
room of the Castellanes" splendid house
that they entertained the King of Por
tugal on Tuesday. The bath was
turned into a dining-room for the occa
sion, and the great central tub was
covered over and the faucets were
made to spout as four fountains from
banks of flowers. It was very effec
tive, and the marble walls, ceiling and
pillars were festooned with blooms,
making the chamber In which Count
Bonl takes his morning dip look like
a Roman banqueting hall.
The society journals went into lyric
transports over the scene, but Ameri
cans are laughing over the affair,
largely because only three or four of
them are Invited. The Castellanes*
guests included only those Americans
who occupy such an exalted : station In
Parisian' society that the hosts, for
their own prestige, could not have
omitted them. There, were, of course,
tho Embassador and Mrs. McCormick,
Prince yon Isenburg, Mrs. Moore and
Mrs. Carroll. The Duchess de la
Rochefoucauld-BlBaccia is In mourning
for her father and could not be there.
There are many heartburnings among
the Countess Bonl's \u25a0 compatriots and
much jealous sneering In ; consequence.
But they have, only .'themselves, . to
blame, for had they been a little more
cordial . In-, their reception of her when
she first came .to Paris she would have
had no occasion to pay back old s_cores.
King Carlos Is quoted as, having ex-,
pressed his surprise -that he was not
happy enough to hjive met . more of
those "charming and so individual
Americans who add so much to Pari
sian society."

SIR EDWARD AT 8 TO I
WINS TENNY HANDICAP
Mandator, Even
Money Favorite,
Unplaced.
Eckersall, Heavily
Played, Wins in
Hard Drive,-
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Santa Clans would have wept great big
icicle tears If he could have aeon the coin
burned up over the reeult of the Tenny
handicap, for two-year-olda, run at In
\u25a0Tleaide track yesterday over a mile.
There were enough coarse bills dumped
into the ring on Mandator to buy a string
of beads and a done brown turkey for
every hiffh private In the Patagonian
army. The Keene colt, forced down to
even money favoritism, finished next to
last. Sir Edward, piloted by Kmmett
; League, shot off in front at the start like
;an explosion of Roman candles, and
; though the field behind him fumed and
sizzled and panted, the lightweight pos
sessed speed enough to stay in the game
and defeat Charlatan out a neck in
1:42&4. The layers went to the ridicu
lously long price of 12 to 1 about the
latter colt. To make matters doubly In
teresting Nealon, the second choice, lost
show honors to Tenordale. The, winner
closed at 8 to 1.
TWO FAVORITES SCORE.
Perfect weather drew a large crowd of
fortune hunters. While but two favorites
scored, the major portion of the book
makers were hard hit.
Knapp met with poor racing luck on
Yellowstone, favorite for the introductory
sprint, finishing unplaced. Birdie P, the
mount of Lloyd Fountain, early showed
in front, winning easily from Jake Ward,
the St. Louis sprinter. Duelist, at odds
of 25 to 1, ran third. * .
Barney Schreiber's colt Tom McGrath,
ridden by Radtke, took the two-year-old
event, at six furlongs. Only galloping the
first part of the Journey, he was brought
to a drive at the close, beating J X F, an
outsider, but a neck. The show went to
Iron "Watson. .
â¢ Eckersall must have looked like
something hanging on a Christmas
tree from the manner in which he was
played to* win the mile and a sixteenth
selling: fixture. The Fink entry picked
up more weight than he did in a pre
vious race, but It seemingly cut no Ice.
From five, the price shrunk away to
1G to 5, and In a drive, Lloyd Fountain
placed him over a neck ahead of Dixie
Lad, the post favorite. Angelica fin
ished an indifferent third. With a
stronger finisher up the first choice
could have won.
HORSES IN EXCITIXG FINISH.
: A heck and a nose apart at the wire,
Bell Reed, Titus II and Bucolic fought
it out for the five-furlong selling
scramble. The former sprinter at all
times enjoyed first call in the betting,
anu Patsy Phillips had him in front
from the start. Titus ran an excellent
race, and a more vigorous finisher than
Sullivan could have about landed the
money. Soundly, an extensively
backed second choice, made a tame
showingr.
Although Northwest had beaten San
Primo over a fast track at a mile, the
books installed the Keene entry favor
ite for the concluding mile and a six
teenth selling number. . San Primo did
not look at his best and Radtke had
drawn his whip before making the
stretch turn. Lloyd Fountain lost con
siderable ground through the stretch
with Northwest and the mare was
hard ridden at the end to down Gate
way a scant half-length.
NOTES OF .THE TRACK.
Lloyd Fountain carried off the saddle
honors in a walk, piloting the winners
Birdie P. Eckersall and Xorthwest.
Thirty-one bookmakers cut in. This j
is the greatest number of recent' years
and speaks volumes for the healthy
condition of the sport.
C. Stubenbord Jr. lost J X F from
the second race. The colt was claimed
for $925 C. C. McCafferty.
Davies & Co. purchased Ora Mc-
Kinney from Captain Rice yesterday.

FOOTBALL GAME
IS DISCUSSED
College - Authorities Offer
Suggestions to Improve
the â¢ Gridiron Sport
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 23.â The circu
lar sent out recently by the University of
Pennsylvania, through its committee on
athletics, with the view of systematizing
football rules, has brought a large num
ber of replies, many of them from repre
sentative State universities, and a still
greater number from colleges and schools.
In the circular the Important questions
were: \u25a0
1. The possible adoption of a simple and
uniform eligibility code to avoid unseemly
squabbles between institutions.
*2. The elimination of brutal and foul
play.
S. The change of "playing rule 3 to min
imize danger."
The suggestions contained in the replies
to the circular have been referred to the
rules committee of the Athletic. Associa
tion of the University of Pennsylvania.
Unreserved .approval of the increase In
the penalties proposed for brutality and
foul play were expressed on a large ma
jority of the replies and approved with
certain modifications In nearly all of the
remainder. As a whole tho eligibility rulÂ«
was cordially commended In more than
three-fourths of the replies.
The replies so far received Indicate a
widespread interest in the subject and are
regarded as an Indication of the desire
among universities and colleges to reach
an agreement regarding college sport.
The desirability of the cultivation of the
jpirit described by President Roosevelt to
Dr. William M. White, chairman of the
athletic committee of the University of
Pennsylvania as that . which underlies
,igreemetJts In sports, is emphasized in the
replies. Answers containing assurances
of approval or valuableSa-iticism are ar
riving in large numbers. A further report
will.b e made in the new year.
OpeuiuÃ of the Polo Season.
There will.be a polo game on Caro

BRITISH NATION
IN GRAVE PERIL
fiev. Hubert Handley Sajs
People Must Learn
to Lead x the Simple Life
APPEALS TO THE KING
Declares That Edward Must
Set His Subjects Good Ex
ample or Ruin Will Come
Sj>ecial Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Dec. 23.â According to a com
mittee composed of some of the most in
liuential local representatives of the peo
ple in the London district of St. Pancraa
King Edward will have to stop motoring,
horse racing, smoking and other things
which the sovereign has hitherto indulged
in. If he wishes to keep the British na
tion from going to the "demnition bow
wows" ho will have to lead the simple
life and try to induce other rich people
to do likewise.
A strongly worded address has been
prepared for his Majesty's benefit by the
Rev. Hubert Handley, the well-known
vicar of St. Pancras, and seconded by
the president of the famous Passmore
Edwards Settlement.
The King was asked to use his influence
"and personal example" to reform the
1 richer section of society, and the distress
committee 'protested "with all the fervor
and depth of their patriotism against the
luxury, excessive love of pleasure and in
; ordinate attention to sport of the rich."
As the resolution has not yet been.. pre-
I sented to the King owing to some dis
! sentient voices, who objected to its exact
wording, the Rev. Hubert Handley, the
instigator of the movement, was inter
viewed at his home in London.
ASKS AID OF KING.
"T^ie movement we inaugurated," said
the Rev. Mr. Handley, "was not directed
particularly against the King, save as the
leader of the wealthy social class in Eng
land, among which class, I must admit,
the pursuit of pleasure is growing more
absorbing daily. We feel that if the King
wcjild lend his countenance to our efforts
it would have an Immense and far-reach
ing Influence on all these people, who to
day are â¢ leading perfectly empty exist
encesâtearing about the country in .motor
cars, with no object save pleasure; devas
tating whole tracts of fine agricultural
districts in Scotland for no other purpose
than keeping; them as game preserves;
yaching, theaters and amusements â lead
ing, in fact, an absolutely vapid life."
â¢/Could you give any instances of par
; ticular persons who live this way?" Was
; asked.
i "Without naming any one in particu
lar," replied the Rev. Mr. Handley, "1
know that there are a number of men
in England with, annual incomes of, say,
5500.C00, out of which they spend $350,000
on nothing else but pleasures such as 1
have mentioned." \u2666
"But what should* these people do
does not the spending of their money
benefit the community at large?" was
asked.
"The spending of .vast sums .in. .mere
pleasure does not benefit the community
at large, as has been shown by such econ
omists as John Stuart Mill, and others., If
one man employs labor to nil the soil
! and the other employs the same labor
merely to dig- a. hole and flll.it. up,, the
; labor In one case is wasted, while in the
other it Is beneficial. .â¢: /.
GREAT CHANGE XECESSAItY.
"What we contend," continued Mr.
Handley, "Is that people with $100,000 a
rear Income should live on $5000 a year
and that the rest of their time and
money should go to philanthropic and
patriotic work of some kind â serving on
local governing boards or in charitable
institutions and so forth. The life and
labor of the rich man. are demanded by
his country, and no man has a right to
squander his time and wealth as he
pleases. He has merely the right to
spend as much as would keep him in
health and enable him to properly dis
charge the duties he owes to the nation.
If the rich man with $350,000 spent on
himself were to spend nearly the whole
of this money on benefiting, uplifting and
helping his fellow man, what a great
change Jt would bring about In the fate
of our country.
"With our whole nation suffering from
terrible social disorders and with our in
stitutions of learning crying for aid, is it
right for these people to go on living as
if life were an empty dream?"
"But how Is this wonderful change to
be brought about?" was asked.
"The man himselfâ the rich spend
thrift." replied the vicar, "must be con
verted. He must see that the danger
of England is the danger of other great
prosperous empires in their prime. These
wealthy men must be brought to see the
uselessness of their existence. The rich
man must set his teeth and clench his
hands and, as the saying goes, decide to
'burn what he. adored and adore what he
burned.' The rich must begin to lead
simple livesâ they must sacrifice them
selves to cave the. nation."
"But would you expect rich men to'
give up everythingâ their clubs, horses
and all their amusements?"
3VATIOX NOW FACES RUIX.
"No set rules can be laid down," was
the reply, "but only the principle must
be admitted that, at the present day,
the rich in this country are throwing
themselves more and more into the vor
tex of pleasure, and they should be
brought to a stand, call a halt and see
where It Is leading them. It means ruin,
both for themselves and for the nation."
"But are there not certain rich men in
England who are already leading simple
lives?"
"There have been a few," was admit
ted, "but it must be general. If the rich
people would only Imitate the late Lord
Leigh, Lord Lieutenant of Warwickshire.
With an income of about $200,000 a year,
he practically gave up his whole life to
the good of his district. He took an In
terest in all educational and poor work,
visited the prisons, Interested himself In
the hospitals and, in fact, was .{he life
and soul of the country. His influence is
f elf there to-day, though he himself has
passed away.
"If these rich -people, instead of wast
ing their precious life In* hollow mock
eries, would take a vital interest in the
affairs of their fellow men, how much
happier they would be themselves.
"It Is for this reason that our commit
tee has decided to appeal directly to the
: rich to leave their extravagant ways
and to give up both their lives and their
wealth to the good of their fellow men.
We cannot but feel that we shall reach
many, and we are confident , the con
science of the rich In England can be
reached and will awaken to a sense- of
their duties. We hope for great things
from this movement.": , r

Special Dispatch to The Call:
LONDON, Dec. 23. â There Is no doubt
that the freakiest house In London is
that whicK Stan's at the corner of
Upper Cheyne Row and Oakley street
in Chlesa. Its owner calsl it the Cha
teau due Savenay, but locally it .is
known by the more appropriate deseg
nation of "Phene's Folly."
The street on which It fronts, Cheyne
Row, is familiar to American visitors to
the metropolis because -it contains Car
lyle's house, one of their favorite places
of pilgrimage. In the season every day/
brings several parties of them to the
place made famous as the residence of
the dyspeptic sage. After paying a fly
ing visit to the interior most of them
take photographs of the house, usually
with Mamie, Sadie or Gracie standing
on the front stoop, and then they hurry
around the corner to Upper Cheyne
Row to secure similar mementos of
Leigh Hunt's house. Generally they
snapshot the wrong one and finally are
brought up with open mouths at the
Oakley street corner by the Chateau dv
Savenay. They consult an irresponsive
Baedeker and then ask one another
what this is.
They may well ask, for it presents
one of the most curious conglomera
tions of architectural and sculptural in
congruities that ever man wasted
money on. It is backed by a wilderness
garden, which really belongs to the
eighteenth century house farther down
the Row, the one Americans usually
mistake for Leigh Hunt's house. The
entire front of the mansion, which Is
four stories high, is completely cov
ered w-ith mystic devices, angels, gar
goyles, lions, grriffons, armorial bear
ings, balustrades, columns and capitals.
No system has been followed in t.ieir
arrangement. It is a veritable night
mare medley. To add to the incongru
ity of the designs, they are painted In
the most vivid and startling colors,
j brilliant reds, bright yellows and emer
ald greens being extensively employed.
Eight large female figures form the
basis of the scheme, and between their
heads are tablets and medallions on
which are depicted snakes, elephants,
sacred bulls, ecclesiastical emblems,
gods and goddesses. On the parapet of
the house are the figures of Priam of
\ Troy and Hecuba, each of them con
fronting a huge dragon. In the center
of the front is a coat-of-arms with
quarterings of mermen, stars and dag
gers, and the motto, "Ex supero spe
pugnam."
In striking contrast to the gorgeous
front; no decorations have been at
tempted on the sides and back of the
house. The windows there are covered
with dust and -many of the panes are
broken. Nobody lives In the house and
no visitors are ever admitted to it.
Dr. Phene, the owner of the property,
lives in a house on the^opposite side of
the street. He Is an antiquarian with
a" purse long enough to permit him to
indulge In his most eccentric fancies.
Some of his ancestors at one time lived
at the Chateau dv Savenay on the
Loire.
The "Folly" represents his efforts to
engraft the outlines of it on the skele
ton of a comparatively modern house,
with additions of his own. After view
ing the copy one cannot blame the Ven
deans much for having pulled the
French chateau about the proprietor's
ears.
The doctor claims descent from the
Phoenicians and Is proud of his ancient
lineage. The house is supposed to em
body the cryptic history of the family
genealogy. Judging' by results It is
awfully tangled and It is small wonder
that Dr.' Phene never seems satisfied
that he has got things right. He is
continually making alterations. Tear
after year goes by and still the house
Is never finished. Decorations, bas-re
liefs, statues and twisted and gilded
columns are put up only to be taken
down again regardless of expense. The
only thing constant about the houee is
the weathercock which always points
due north.
The most favorable view concerning
the house was one the writer over
heard as he passed two workmen who
were discussing it. "Well," said one,
"I suppose everybody has a right to his
own fancies if he can afford 'em."
"Right," agreed the other; "right you
are, mate. An' It gives employment to
the honest workingman."
"Corpse" Aska for Pipe.
LONDON, Dec. 23.â 1t was the night
before the burial of a woman in Leices"
tershire, and two people stood by the
coffin. Suddenly they saw the "corpse"
move, and then they heard it cry out:
"Where is my pipe?" After the, first
excitement the "body" was removed
from the coffin and put to bed, and soon
after the woman sat up, cheerfully de
claring that her "smoke" j was the
sweetest she had ever had. She Is now

BISHOP GETS
SOME ADVICE
Emerges Plain Secretary of
Canal Board After a
Talk With the President
NOT YET COMMISSIONER
Must "Go Slow" Until the
Refractory Senate Decides
to Confirm Nomination
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BURBAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Dec 23.â Joseph B. Bish
op, who as press agent of the Isthmian
Canal Commission was the target of a
fire of criticism In the Senate, had a lit
tle talk with the President at the White
House to-day and later said:
"I am attending to" my duties as secre
tary of the Canal Commission, and that
is all at this time. I expect to perform
those duties until confirmed by the Senate
as an Isthmian Canal Commissioner."
There is a general feeling that it is beat
for the relations between the Senate and
the Canal Commission that Bishop's role
should be confined to that of secretary
pending action by the Senate on his nom
ination as Canal Commissioner.
Bishop seemed to be rather put out to
day at the stories generally printed that
he has already assumed the duties of a
Commissioner. These stories, in part_at
least, were caused by remarks which'he
himself made. President Roosevelt pro
poses to stand fast by Bishop, just as he
has always stood fast by his friends who
have been under fire in their official ca
pacity.
There is no doubt that the President
and Bishop to-day talked of Bishop's po
sition In the Canal Commission of
the attitude which the Senate has taken
on Bishop's duties at $10,000 a year. The
Senate Is extremely touchy Just now at
the high salaries paid in canal work. The
manner in which the nominations of the
Commissioners were confirmed aroused
the ire of the Senate to the point of re
calling the confirmation of the nomina
tions and for Bishop to assume openly
the functions of a Canal \ Commissioner
! would be equlvalent_to waving a red flag
before a bull.
MACHINE WILL SMOKE
ANY KIND OF CIGAR
Washington Officials Use a
New Contrivance to Test
Tobaccos.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Dec 23. â Smoking
from six to eight cigars, Including
everything from clear Havana grown
in Cinnecticut to Plttsburg "stogies" at
one and the same time Is a feature
which has prevailed at the Depart
ment of Agriculture every day.
The officials wanted to make an in
vestigation to better the dualities of
different tobaccos and were unable to
get a "smoke squad" like Chemist
Wiley's "poison squad," so the trick is
being done by a specially -Invented
machine. This machine will smoke
any old kind of a cigar and as many
of them as are furnished. It is fitted
up with a number of glass tubes, into
which fit cigars, and the draught is
given by a vacuum arrangement
caused by a Jet of water. The depart
ment has received many samples of
what is known as the "Asbestos leaf"
tobacco. This is leaf which does not
burn freely and is almost wholly
worthless as tobacco. In order to im
prove the quality. of the leaf and to se
lect the seed for future crops the ex
periments are being made.
TAFT'S PHILIPPINE

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON. Dec 23. â Secretary
Taft's Philippine trip developed a sec
ond romance to-day when the engage
ment of Representative Swager Sher
ley of Louisville and Miss Mlgnon
Crltten of Staten Island, N. V., wajs
announced.
-Miss Crltten Is a friend of Miss
Roosevelt and at the latter's Invita
tion was a member of the Philippine
touring party. When Nicholas- Long
worth was showering attentions on
the President's daughter the brilliant
Kentucky Congressman did not neglect
Miss Critten.
Secretary Taft is pleased over 'the
engagements resulting from the trip.

MARINER "RUNS AMUCK"
AND JUDGE IS PUZZLED
Policeman Explains That Sailor Invited
. â¢ Folk to Imbibe at His Expense.
His Honor Opines That Offering to Treat
Does Not Constitute Misdemeanor.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Ask<d if Ole "Olesen were not a
riscudonym. either adopted for jail or
registration or bestowed by a desk
sergeant rnuoh given to ihe coinage of
*tpt sobriquets for befuddK-d prisoners,
the brawny defendant, a seaman, made
?icÂ£ative reply.
"Ole Olesen ban da nani Ay got an
t:\vedrn," he informed Police Judge
C'abanifis, "an* Ay ban note ashammed
That point settled, the prosecution
proceeded. It averred that Mr. Ole
sen, with a quart bottle cf whisky in ;
one hand and a glass tumbler In the
other, was "running amuck" (emphasis
on the phraset when a policeman over
took, arrested and disarmed him, all
of whie'4 happened on East street, city
and county of San Francisco.
"The charge is that of disturbance:
of th* peace." said the Judge, "and j
the court dePires to know if said peace .
disturbance consisted of 'running!
amuck," whatever that process may be." |
"That," responded tl'.e prosecuting at
torney, "can be best explained by the
complaining officer."
The complaining officer thereupon
stated that Mr. Olesen "ran amuck"
by spc-edingr along the cobble-paved
highway and loudly uttering words
t.-hkh to him (the complainant) were
*t the time unintelligible, but which
were subsequently interpreted as in
discrimir.ate invitations to partake of
the contents of the bottle there pro
duced in evidence.
"If 'running amuck,* " opined the
court, "consists of inviting persons to
imbibe intoxicants. It is an act ex
tenelvely indulged In at this merry
holiday time in this ever-hospitable
community. Nor can I see where It
can reasonably be pronounced a mis
demeanor."
Aftrr considerable discussion it was
marie apparent that the offensive phase
of Mr. Olesen's ""running amuck" was
his rude and IÂ»oisterous manner of ac
costing- pedestrians whom he desired
to aid him in emptying the bottle, and
for such overexuberance he was sen
tenced to ten days* imprisonment,
It evidently was the Christmas spirit
that actuated Miss Mabel Bradford,

kindness upon 20-year-old Charles Red

the case was called before Judge Con
lan the fair complainant not only dis
played rtluctance to prosecute, but
save bail in the sum of $10 for the de
fendant's reappearance next Wednes
day. Then she strolled the corridor
with him and talked earnestly, while
he listened with contrite attention.
Master Redmond had been in the em
ploy of Miss Bradford about eight
months when she began to sjuspect
that ho was the author of mysterious
shortages In the cash; so she placed $3
where he had free opportunity to pil
fer it. which he did. To make doubly
sure that his larceny was willful, she
similarly tempted him with a $6 bait,
and lie took it. This thoroughly con
vinced that he was dishonest, she filed
two charges of petty larceny against
him, and the final outcome of the case
remains to lie seen.
Miss Bradford is a sister-in-law of
Polico Judge-elect Shortall and a young
woman of rare business attainments.
In defense of Tony J. Cardoza. accused
of having sold a 50-cent pool to Patrolman
Dower, the ooint was raised that inas
much as Busy Bee, the 'horse on which
the money, was wagered, had failed to
perform, having been scratched, the
wager was null and void, ergo no wager
at all. Judge Mogan, however, ignored
the finely drawn technicality and gave
Mr. Cardoza the alternative of paying a
$20 fine or serving twenty days in prison.
The defense filed notice of appeal.
Miss Maud Wendell, yellow coiffured
and fashionably gowned, toyed with
the dangling ends of her silver fox boa
and smiled derisively as she harkened
to Patrolman McManus tell Judge Mo
gan that she was an old offender who
had ignored repeated warnings to
cease promenading the retail district
while her gait afforded evidence that
she was inebriated. When the accuser
had concluded his testimonj' she asked
the Judge If he would permit her to
"say a word," and when the permission
was granted she said several thousand
words and was still talking when his
Honor endeavored to stem the oral flow
by continuing the case till after the
holidays.
"And it's up to me to give bail, I sup
pose." said Miss Wendell, "after I've
spent every cent I could raise for
Christmas presents? I'd like to know,
anyhow, why a lady can't go shopping
without having a policeman follow her
and â "
"The only shopping she did," grimly
interjected the o*ncer, "was in saloons."
"In-deed! How clever of you to find
it out: My, but It takes cuteness to be
a cop!" Her tone and her glare at the
policeman were plainly Intended to
wither htm. but he never flinched.
"Oh," she exclaimed, vehemently,
"somebody'H smart for this!"
"She served ten days for the same
thing not long ago," said the relentless
McManus, "and I think she will be

Miss Wendell's indignation was too
deep for utterance, and she supinely
allowed Bailiff Mahoney to lead her
back to durance.

Miss Ethel Clarke of 432 Golden Gate
avenue opined that human impudence at
tained its apogee when a parcel of dress
goods forwarded to her from Minneapolis
in care of Mrs. Emma Winters, modiste,
at 528 Eddy street, was retained by that
lady, whose obvious object was to obtain
the task of transforming the fabric into
gowns. She declined to give the package
to the consignee unless it was opened in
her (Mrs. Winters') presence, and Miss
Clarke not only refused to comply with
Mrs. Winters' desire, but resorted to
search warrant procedure- to get posses
sion of her property. When the warrant
was displayed to Mrs. Winters she sur
rendered the goods and told the policeman
that her motive in holding them was to"
make sure that she would not be held
responsible for any damage or shrinkage
that might subsequently be alleged by
Miss Clarke.
"Of all the cheeky things I ever en
countered," said Miss Clarke, petite and
pretty, to the Judge, "the attitude of
Mrs. Winters was the worst: The pack
age containing material for three dresses
was sent to me as a Christmas present
from Minneapolis, and Just because it was
addressed in care of Mrs. Winters she
thought she had a right to make me open
it in her presence so that she could make
a bid for the making of the gowns. But
she was fooled for once."
Miss Clarke's grandmother volubly In
dorsed all that the younger lady had said
anent Mrs. Winters' conduct, and was
still talking when the Judge issued an
order instructing the property clerk to
release the package.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 24/ 1905
SEA SWALLOWS
TWO FISHERMEN
Their Boat Disappears From
the Fleet and Nothing
but Wreckage Is Found
LIFE SAVERS TOO LATE
Crab Hunters Perish by
Foundering* or Capsizing
of Their Little Craft
Giuseppe Delegardo and Michel Ba
roni, fishermen, were drowned yester
day morning in the surf off Point Pedro
through either the capsizing or foun
dering of their boat. Delegardo, who
was 35 year's old, leaves a widow and
family In a modest little home at 425
Bay street. Baroni .was 19 years of age
and single. He lived with the Dele
gardos.
Xews of the disaster was brought to
Meigge wharf by other fishermen who
were In the vicinity when the Baroni
boat . disappeared. Here is the story
they tell:
The ill-fated tboat, which was owned
by Baroni, was off Point Pedro, in com
pany with a fleet "of other craft. The
occupants of all the boats were busily
engaged fishing for crabs. There was
a high sea running, but the sun was
shining brightly and the waves were
not so high that they caused any
anxiety to men used as these fisher
men are to . braving the elements in
their anger.
The Baronlboat was a little farther
in than the others and got the full
benefit of the .swirl of waters which
fringed the breakers."*; Suddenly the
Baroni boat disappeared. Nobody was
looking at the time and nobody can
tell just what happened.
In an instant the alarm was given
and every boat headed for the place
where the Baroni boat had been but a
few seconds before. All the searchers
recovered was. a. little wreckage â two
oare, a hatch, cover and an oil can.
Nothing was seen of the two men, and
after cruising about for an hour the
fishermen notified the South Beach Life
Saving Station and resumed their fish
ing.
The Government life savers made a
thorough search, but a vain one. They
will keep' a lookout along the beach
in the hope that on the next incoming
tide the sea will give up its dead.
A weeping woman and three small
children will spend a sad Christmas at
425 Bay street, and later on, when the
mails carry the news of the tragedy,
there will be a dark day in a little
home on the shores of the Mediter
ranean, where Baroni's parents reside.

Ask the man who knows. The American

fendant.
"I'm ashamed of what I did." was
the response, "and it never shall hap
pen again."
"He always was a good husband and
father until our poverty at Christmas
made him feel blue," said the wife,
nodding gratefully to the Judge and
following her spouse to the door.
Seventeen-year-old Hugh Johnson, who
claimed he labored. in a canning factory,
went a-shopplng Friday evening without
having previously equipped himself with
pecuniary means of barter, and in a 10
cent store at 9<3 Market street he was
laden with a. large and miscellaneous as
sortment of the merchandise there offered
for sale when Patrolman Speck arrested
him for shoplifting.
"The numerous cases of shoplifting now
in these courts." said Judge Mogan, after
he had continued the hearing of Master
Johnson's case till next Tuesday, "indi
cate that penniless persons afflicted with
larcenous impulse should shun the places
where Christmas wares are displayed for
sale." \ ;l '*K:

Henry K. Lyons, a grizzled vaga
bond, abruptly awoke from sodden
slumber in the cage of Judge Cabaniss"
tribunal and asked a fellow-prisoner
what the day was.
"It's Monday an! Chrls'mus," was
the facetious answer.
"An' wofs th' time o' day?" Mr. Ly
ons inquired.
"Half-pas' free," replied the humor
ist.
"An' dinner's over, is it?" was the
succeeding query, delivered In a tone
reeking of anxiety.
"Hours ago â I'm pickin' some o' de
turkey out o' me teeth now," rejoined
the jester, pretending to suit the ac
tion to the He.
"Dats more o' me blasted luckl"
ejaculated Mr. Lyons, dashing his bat
tered hat to the floor and thus attract
ing to himself the attention of Bailiff
Donohue, who growled, "Silence
there!" and wagged an admonitory
finger at the peace disturber.
"I don't care," was the revolution
ary response. "After gettin' pinched
so's I'd get a good Chrls'mas dinner
In jail here I've gone an' overslep* an'
missed de feed. Say, ain't der sno
chance o' gettin' a crack at wot's left
over?" - v 7v'
When the bailiff had considerately
explained that the great Christian
holiday's dawn was among future
events Mr. Lyons . chuckled gleefuyy
and then bestowed a withering glance
at the Imperturbable, face of the wit
who had so cruelly alarmed him. His
consternation was revived, however,
when he faced the bench and the
Judge mischievously displayed symp
toms of ordering his dismissal.
"Tut, tut," said his Honor, with af
fected severity, to -the policeman who
testified . that 1 Mr. Lyons . was very
drunk when arrested.. "At this Christ
mas time we can afford to look light
ly upon intoxication when it is not ac
companied by disturbance of the
peace."
"But I b'lieve I did kick up a row,"
Mr. Lyons hastily and earnestly af
firmed.
"Well, I suppose we must take your
word for it and sentence you to ten
days."
"Dats de candyâ l means, tank yer
Honor," said â Mr. Lyons, and . the
springy step with which he returned
to the corral satisfied all beholders
that he was happy.

Woe Upon Woe Falls
Upon Decadent
Gladiator.
Poor old Bob Fitzslmmous, who,
strangled from behind by age, was
crumbled to pieces in his fight with
O'Brien last Wednesday night, received
a more subtle and cruel Mow yester
day. A telegram from Xcw York an
rounced that the- young wife ho had
taken to himself while in han Francis
co two years ajjo had deserted him.
Thus as he is *tnt farther on the long
downward toboggan flight from the
pinnacle of his pugilistic career is he
robbed of the love tliat v.ould have
been consolation. Ko!> r.in only drown
| iiis sorrow now in melodrama.
Kltr.simmons married Julia Gifford
two years apo at the Palace Hotel in
this city. It was his third wedding, his
second wife. Rose Julian, having died
after pears of absolute devotion to him.
Julia Gifford was ;i young actress, and
was at the time sinking in the light
opera "When Johnny Comes Marching:
Homo." She v,as twenty years younger
than the veteran pugilist. ;uid ho, guile
less as a child toward women, was
deeply in lovÂ«\ ;iÂ» he is yet -to-day, in
spite of licr desertion, was pretty
and vivaÂ«-ious and reputed somewhat
flighty. Tor the last two years Bob
had treasured her. His bank account
was ir their joint name. It amount
ed to J50.U00 on<e. but little Is expect
ed to i>c left, wore the jewels of
his former "A'ifo. and has them now.

saya that they are worth $100,000; but |
Uiat Kt*rt\+.xn*nVi; veracitx. in matters
thai hcip make stage advertising is
far from unimpeachable.
The telegram that came from New
York yestorday was from Mrs. Fitz
â¢ Simmons herself, and was addressed to
Manager Friedman. The latter's part
in the affair is somewhat singular. He
tays that Mrs. Fitzsimrr.ons told him
a year aso that she meant to leave her
husband, and he names tho man to
\u25a0whom she has gone. Yet when askod
if he had warned the pugilist, whoso
affairs he had absolutely in hand, he
says that he did not. At the same time
be is the one who makes the asser
tion that thÂ« faithless wife got away
\u25a0with Bob"s 350,000 bank account and |
:hc Jloo.'> f Â»0 worth of jewels. The te!- J

DOCTOR SAYS
TAPLEY GAVE
HIM SIGNALS
Asserts That Dying
Man Motioned Aftej:
Trap Was Sprung. .
JERSEY CITY, N. J., Dec. 23. â Dr.
Carlton Simon, who witnessed the
hanging yesterday of Edwin F. Tapley
Jr., declares that the murderer gave
the prearranged signals in proof that
he was conscious nearly half "a min
ute after the trap had been sprung.
Dr. Simon said:
"The actual test on the gallows was
most successful. Tapley was abso
lutely in possession of his mental fac
ulties. The hands and fingers of the
da.-igling body moved with convulsive
contractions. Then the hands fell
rigid at the sides. Five seconds
parsed and then Tapley began the sig
nals agreed upon between us.
"The first signal came as Tapley,
holding the left hand extended rigid
ly downward, raised the right slowly
and far as the bonds permitted him
and made three distinct contractions of
the thumb and forefinger. Then, with
clearly determined effort, the dying
man lowered his right hand, held it for
an instant rigidly against his thigh,
and, slowly raising the left hand, re
peated the signal. At the third con
traction of the left hand there acemed
barely strength in the dying fingers to
carry out the agreed programme.
"To any man of scientific knowledge,
viewing this test with a fjill knowl
edge of all the governing conditions,
the following conclusions are Inevita
ble, namely, that Tapley was alive ana
in conscious torture for nearly half a
minute after the fall of the drop. That
he was literally strangled to death In
the name of the law."

PROVIDENCE. R. I. # Dec. 23.â Lillian
A. Hunt, 21 years old, who has been
prominent In the social world as an ac
complished singer, died to-day In a .hos
pital In this city from tuberculosis of
the right hip, brought about, her phy
sicians say, by dancing too much. Her
complaint was rather an unusual one, and
as she had been ill about three months
the doctors attending her were at first
doubtful as to the exact cause of her con
dition. A diagnosis made by one of the
most skillful surgeons of this city dis
closed the fact that she was suffering
from hip trouble. Two months ago she
was removed to a hospital and three op
erations were performed by the surgeons
in an attempt to save her life.
For a time she grew better and hopes
were entertained that she would ulti
mately recover. Monday the final opera
tion was performed and then It developed
that her life could not be saved. After
this operation the patient grew rapidly
worse and to-day expired.
According to her family physician, who
cared for her before she went to the hos
pital, the young woman Was passionately
fond of dancing, and last April before she
became ill danced at various social af
fairs until he thinks the tissues of her
hip became worn and the muscles affected
in such a way that tuberculosis devel

MIRACULOUS ESCAPE
WSfffi. INSTANT DEATH
Bullet Enters Lower Part

Ranges Downward; Failing
to Even Touch a Chord
OAKLAND, Dec. 23. â While playing
this afternoon with a 44-caliber bull
dog revolver, -which he had found in
tho room of a lodger In his mother's
home, t77 Hobart street, Lester White
hurst, the 5-year-old son of Mrs. L. M.
Whitehurst, accidentally discharged
the weapon, the bullet striking his
2-year-old sister, Lillian, fairly In the
face, the force of the blow knocking
the child half way across the room.
Mrs. Whitehurst, who was In the yard,
ran into the house on hearing the re
port of thy pistol, just in time to sec
the boy lift his sister to her feet.
Blood was streaming from a wound
in the baby's face and the frant/c
mother at llrst thought the child was
dead, and was much surprised when
the little girl opened her eyes and be
gan to cry. Hurriedly washing the
blood from the child's face, Mrs. White
hurst stanched the flow as best she
could and at once summoned Dr. C. 11.
Dodge to attend the .jaby.
! : Examination by the physician dis
closed the fact that the bullet had
glanced after striking the left side of
the face and had taken -a downward
course,- narrowly missing the jawbone,
and making its exit at the lower part
of the left cheek and entered the neck,
linally lodging- against the left collar
bone, just under the skint where it was
removed without difficulty by the doc
tor. The bullet in its course missed not
only the bones of the face, but failed
to touch, any of the cords of the jaw,

fully hurt by the recoil of the pistol
after the shot, the butt of the weapon
striking him in the stomach and caus

HAERIMAN MAY BUY
TACOMA TIDE LANDS
Owners Start for San Fran

TACOMA. Dec 23.â General James M.
Ashton left to-day for San Francisco,
where he will continue negotiations with
Harriman railroad interests for the sale
to* them, of terminal grounds on Tacoma
tide lands. Ashton and Allen C. Mason,
together with others, have pooled their
tide land holdings, aggregating a thou
sand acres and comprising almost the re
mainder of the water front from the St.
Paul road terminals to the farther side
of the bay. Yesterday General Ashton
filed with the State Land Commissioners
transfers to himself covering 640 acres of
tide lands; for which the State was paid
their value under the appraisement of
ten years ago, when the contracts of sale
were first executed. It is understood that
360 acres of these lands will pass to the
Harriman railroads. This tract lies just
east of the St. Paul terminals, from which
it is separated by Sitkum avenue. The
railroads probably will dredge the land,
thereby giving another deep water chan

FIGHT OVER GOPCEVIC
WILL IS COMPROMISED
Ex-Gripman Gets Principal Part of Fortune
"" The lesal battle; for the $600,000 estate
lefi by Harry Augustus Floyd-Gopceyic
has been brought to an end by compro-.
raise. The relatives who contested the ;
young lady's will, which gave all her
property to her husband, have been given
$50,000 and the.ex-gripman will be left to
enjoy the remainder. All litigation in the
matter was dismissed yesterday afternoon
at the request of the opposing attorneys.
The strange marriage, the untimely
death and the peculiar will of- the de
ceased woman, combined with the serious
charges and multifarious litigation that
followed her demise have aroused great
public interest during the last two and a
half years.
Harry Floyd was the only daughter of j
ono of California's richest families. Her
father In dying left his estate to his wife.
When she passed away the property was
left to Miss Floyd in trust for whatever
children might come to her when she
should be married. In the event of her
death, unmarried or childless, the estate
was to revert to charities and to other
relatives.
EARLY LIFE IS PLEASAAT.
Harry Floyd had every opportunity to
enjoy her early years, and it is said she
made the most of her chances. She was
particularly bright and . vivacious in her
early womanhood, but changed somewhat
as she approached the age of SO years.
It is said that Bhe was of a peculiarly
sensitive nature, and that too close study
of the characters famous in history and
fiction made her somewhat depressed at
times after, she passed 25. Sbe was fond
of impersonating some of -these people
created in the progress of events, or by
author's brain, and was often completely
carried away in such endeavor. These
facts were adduced by the contestants of
the will. VV ;
Her friendship with Eliza Pritchardwas
Damon and Pythias over again in the
feminine sender. For a few years pre
vious to her marriage she was extremely
exclusive. Of this later history, almost
nothing is known except by her few inti
mates, who declared at the trial that she
was perfectly sane.
One day while Harry Floyd was riding
on a Sacramento street cable car her at
tention was drawn to the sturdy gripman.
She used to 'watch him pass the house
after that, and finally she spoke to him.
In a short time they became well ac
quainted. He told her that he was a de
scendant of the royal family of the Obre
novich dynasty. She listened eagerly to
his tales of adventures in the Servian
hills and in the streets of troublous Bel
grade. Again he told her the strange his
tory of the Obrenoviches, who descended
from goatherds. >, .\.
COUPLE MARRY SUDDENLY.
Almost without warning. Gopcevic of.
the storied European principality and
Harry Floyd, the California heiress, stole
i away one bricht October day in 1903 and
were married by Judge Sayre at Lake
port. The news of the wedding created
profound astonishment. The gripman was
j metamorphized into a capitalist who
I could buy and sell all his fellow â¢ work
men. He received unbounded congratu
lations from his friends, and her unex
pected act brought perfunctory recogni
tion from here.
\ Milos Mitrov Gopcevic at once took
charge of the property, and administered
its affairs until his bride's death on Feb
ruary 11 of the following' year, four
months af tor the. nuptials. Then com
menced a battle for, the estate. The con
testants were Mary Floyd McAdoo, sister
of the dead girl's father; "John Hume and
Julia Hume, children of another deceased
aunt, and Jane Parker,, Lucy. Matthews,
Ida Matthews, Rosalie Lloyd, Robert
Matthews and .William \u25a0\u25a0 Matthews, heirs
of . Mrs. I. S. Matthews, also an aunt.
Litigation of .various kinds was instituted
to keep the ex-gripman from. getting the
Immense fortune he knew "so well how to
enjoy. '< \u25a0
'\u25a0'â¢\u25a0\u25a0 DECISIONS FAVOR GRIPMAX.
Upto the time of the compromise the
legal decisions had been unfavorable to
the- contestants. Judge Sayre of Lake
County bad decided., that . the will 1 was
valid and ' the case was on â¢ appeal "to ; tho
Supreme Court. Another proceeding '\u25a0 of
â¢ similar -nature was on trial in -the San
| Francisco Superior Court. Still another
i proceeding to - determine the validity of
| the trust clause in the will of Harry
i Floyd's mother had been instituted, and
it looked as if litigation might eat up the
fortune. None of : the parties concerned
wanted this to happen and so & compro
: mlse was suggested. As one of the law
yers puts it, "Neither, side suggested a
compromise. It- just happened like two
people deciding to get married." .
Gopcevic's lawyers, Charles Wheeler
and Judge John F. Davis, figured out I
about what it would cost to fight the case
to a finish, and $50,000 is the..amount upon
which they decided to compromise. Judge
James Magulre and. Carl Lindsay, on the
other side, helped their opponents to be
lieve future litigation would cost that
much, and so it was agreed all around
to settle and auit. d
King Peter of Servia lacks the money
to buy a crown, and in honor of the sea
son, Gopcevic, even though he be of the
Obrenovich pretenders, ought to remem
ber his royal compatriot.

THE BEST THING OBTAINABLE
In this line is the stock of the Colonial
Gold Mining Company of Nevada. \u25a0
THE NEXT ACCEPTABLE PRESENT
is a few thousand shares of stock In the
Tonopah-Berkeley at present quotation, for
in GO days its value will more than double.
AN ANNUAL INCOME.
The Rosecrans Gold Mining located In
California exceeds anything ever offered at
the price. Buy a few shares for yourself
bs a present and a revenue producer for the
future. . -."â¢\u25a0. '
THINK WHAT IT MEANS TO YOU.
A good gold stock pays 100 per cent per
annum easier than savings banks pay 4
per cnt, or mortgages pay 6 per cent.
Take the celebrated Moraydena Mining Com-
pany at Grass Valley. It will pay even
more thaa 100 per cent. It consists of 80
acres of the richest gold channels in the
world. John H. Hammond, the great mining
expert, writes of this claim: "The yield
per mi!e of channel of the average charac-
ter at low estimate is from $2,000,000 to
$3,000,000." And more yet. the largest nug-
get in the world was found In the Moray-
dena mine, weighing 240 pounds and had
$51,840 of gold in it.
OIVB YOURSELF OR NEXT BEST
FRIEND A BLOCK OF ANY ONE OF
THESE STOCKS FOB CHRISTMAS.

IENT FOR TEARS TO COME.

by his DRUGLESS H'D RADIUM treatment.
To enable the DEAF and SICK readers of

ONE-HALF his ut-ua! moderate FEE, thus

Market, and many others (whose addresses

SKEPTICS a* myself, have testified over
their eignature? that they have WITNESSED
â¢ numerous remarkably succtesful treatments
Â«>f total DEAFNESS and various supposed
INCURABLE maladies. The ENORMOUS
abdominal DROPSY case I named last Eun-
rtay has, by "reduction' of the dropey, LOST
SIXTEEN POUNDS in weight tire past we<-k
and the abdomen is now perfectly 'natural'
!n Fize. The 2:Â» years DIPSOMANIAC who
Â«-ould NEVER pars the door of a saloon, has
not onoe touched liquor the past 7 days. He
find h!s family are 'overjoyed.' E. AC-

ous BRIGHTP disease, said yesterday: *J

; â¢ r. treatments.' Hl* wife* totally DEAF *ar
inrtantly heard a 'WHISPER et 25 feet, also
her NEURALGIA ceased In a MOMENT.
Â«Â»ne of our "most" prominent men in the

DEAF ear made to hear well at nearly SO
. feet. Rexradio 'comâ i-anicated' hie 'mys-
' terioue" healing power to 2 persons, and
â¢-ach went and 'successfully' treated their
rick friends. A greatly bloated (DROPSY)
leg âa* reduced to normal size. A dangerous
!case of HEART disease instantly lost all
PAINS, ar.d the BEATS became REGULAR.
A DEAF MUTE heard and spoke well. Now,
I assert on ray honor that I K-N-O-W thei>e
to be F-A-C-T-S absolutely beyond all DIS- V

Former President of the

cusses the Hecent Deal
PEEDICTS A DOWNFALL
Says Alleged Philanthropist
Will Not Dare to Bring
Suit Against Him for Libel
BALTIMORE. Dec. 23.â "What do
you think of Thomas F. Ryan as a phil
anthropist?" was asked to-day of John
Skelton Williams of Richmond, former
president of the Seaboard Air Lino sys
tem. Williams laughed and said:
"My sense of the ridiculous Is invari
ably aroused when I read of tha pro
fessions of virtue and publio spirit and
the protestation of philanthropy by Mr.
Ryan. When I first read that hÂ« had
purchased the Equitable stock to save,
the company and protect the policy
holders my lungs, like those of Jacques
in *As You Like It,' began to crow like
a chanticleer. When I was told by the
newspapers what Harriman's experi
ence had been with tho philanthropist
I think I laughed a long half hour by
the church clock.
"I don't rejoice over the misfortunes
or mistakes of any other man. To tell
the truth I would rather laugh at my
self. I don't give up a fight easily
when I feel that I have been wronged,
and I am not yet sure that Ryan ha 3
won the object of his transactions with
me, which was the control of the Sea
board Air Line Railway system. How
ever that may be, I did hope that I
might serve as a horrible example, a
solemn warning:, an ominous bone at
the mouth of the wolf's den or some
thing of that kind.
"Yet, here comes Harriman. Justly
esteemed as one of the shrewdest,
sharpest and most thoroughly sophisti
cated masters of finance in the world,
and walks into the same trap. I do
not say or suppose that he believed any
i more than I do or than you do or any
body else on earth does, that Ryan was
purely disinterested and working for
our fine old friend. Pro Bono Publico.
Like me, however, he did accept Ryan'3
solemn and repeated personal assuranca
of personal good faith.
"I imagine that Ryan has a certain
sardonic humor. Reflecting that he had
the swag safely stored, he must have
laughed and then, straightening his feat
ures with solemn sanctity, gone to the
front to bow to the public and say that
he had done the whole thing to prevent a
panicâ and to make a name for himsel?.*
"He Is right about that part of it. I
think he haa established and perpetuated
for himself several names of a kind usu
ally preceded by a \T among the pro
fane, by such words as 'infamous,' or
'despicable,' among the more moderate
and invariably resented by the self-re
specting and sensitive.
"One of Ryan's merits is that he
knows himself and understands his
status pretty well. He never has sued
anybody for libel. I wish he would
sue meâ or youâ with the understand
ing that I am to pay the coats and the
verdict and that I be allowed to sustain
my allegations by evidence on mitaga
tion of the damages.
"Mark what I tell you when I pre
dict that he win live to be laughed at.
as he has made laughter and forced his
more philosophic victims to laugh at
themselves!"
EIGHT JIKX ARE KILLED
WHILE WORKING IN MINE
IRONWOOD. Mich., Dec. 23.â Eight
men were killed to-day by a fall of
1000 tons of ore from a slip on the
1300-foot level of the Newport mine In
Ironwood.
The dead: Joel Harru, John Frank,
Peter Demerrer, James B. Lynch. Alex
ander Pareabcare, Nick Cregovgil, Joe
Luckner, Frank Trail.
On account of the great danger from
drifting ore and broken timbers sev

the bodies are recovered.

NEGROES RIOT
IN THE SOUTH
Christmas Frolic in Georgia
Ends in a Row hi Which
Two Persons Are Killed
OTHERS BADLY INJURED
Colored Woman Is Among
Victims of Deadly Fusil
lade in a Turpentine Camp
VALDOST, Gal, Dec. 23.â A bloody riot
among nogroes was reported here to-day
from Kv/ing. a turpentine camp, between,
Fargo and St. Georsia, on the Georgia
Southern and Florida Railroad. The riot
was the result of -a Christmas frolic
among negroes who had been drinking.
A general fusillade occurred and proba
bly ISf ty shots were flred. Two negroes
were killed, outright, three were mortally
wounded and died later, while eight
others received bullet wounds.
One negro .woman vas among the kill
ed and several women 'were wounded.
One of the women was brought to Fargo
for treatment, having received several
bullet wounds in the body. A negro child
was shot in the jaw and will probably
die;
It was impossible TO. get in direct com
munication with the place, as there is no
telegraph office there and only meager
information could be had from nearby
stations over the railroad wires.
Parties who came on the train from
that part of the State stated that the row
was enirely among the negroes and that
liquor and v/omen caused' it.
There is, however, a report that the
white superintendent of Still tried to stop
the light among the negroes and thus
became involved in it and that he saved
his life only by quick work with his gun.
This s^ory cannot be verified, but it is
told by a negro who came in on the
train 10-day.

$9,626 32, alleged to be due , the plaintiff
on receivers' certificates issued by Hay
& Boggess, receivers of the company.
The complaint sets forth that during the
year 1897-98 Boggess promoted the sale of
the Abbott Quicksilver mine in Lake
County, California, and organized the
Abbott Quicksilver Mining Company of
Illinois, with Charles E. Hay, president.
The company became heavily involved,
under the management of Boggess, and
issued and sold bonds to the amount of
$UO,*ooo, secured by "mortgage and deed of
trust to Edward Ridgeley, trustee.
The company then sold the mine to
the Empire Consolidated Quicksilver
mine of New Jersey, incorporated and
owned by Boggess, who operated the mine
at a profit for nearly three years, but
owing to the alleged manipulations of
Boggess the company was wrecked and
placed in the hands of the receiver.
KTKOXC ALLEGATIONS.
By misrepresentation it is said Boggess
induced the court of New Jersey to ap
point him and R. H. McNee as receivers
in New Jersey and later the appointments
were confirmed by the court in Cali
fornia. On tho representation of the in
terests adverse to Bosgess the New Jer
sey . court saw its mistake and removed
the receivers, who immediately handed in
their resignations to the court in Cali
fornia and were discharged.
Boggess then prevailed upon the hold
ers of the bonds Issued by the Abbott
Company, and after promising them to
defray all expenses, got them to begin
foreclosure proceedings, and again he
was appointed receiver, along with
Charles E. nay. Tills action was begun
in February, 1903, and at that time the
mine was in excellent operating condi
tion.
Boggess, representing this fact to the
court, secured permission to operate the
mine in conjunction with Hay. The mine
was run at a profit, but what became of
the money is problematical, as on Sep
tember 2-S he reported to the court that
he had incurred an indebtedness of
$1772 S3 in performing his duties as re
ceiver. The court authorized him and
Hay to issue receivers' certificates, to be
first and underlying liens, for the amount.
;"%â¢ 1 BOKROWS GOODLY SUM.
With these certificates as security Bog
gess borrowed $9626 82 through Henry S.
Bridge, trustee, pledging himself, both as
receiver and personally, to use every ef
fort to secure the pyament of the amount
within thirty days. Five months later
Boggess again reported to the court that
he had incurred a further indebtedness
in performing his duties as receiver In the
aggregate amount of $14,963 85, and by
various representations induced Judge
Buck, presiding in the Superior Court of
Lake County, to make and constitute this
latter amount an underlying lien prior
and paramount to the $11,776 25 formerly
created by him.
In addition to this alleged juggling of
interests the property has been ruined, it
is charged, by the neglect or fraudulent
acts of the receivers, until the only re
dress now obtainable by the various
claimants is through an action" directed
against the receivers and their bondsmen.

"EYE-WITNESS"
IS LIVELY PLAY
Melodrama Bursts Forth in
Its Pristine Glory at
the Refurnished Central
NOTHING IN IT DULL
Hairbreadth 'Scapes Abound
in Production That Goes
"Zip" /From the Start
Even to a fight among the gods it was
just like old times at the Central last
night. "The Eye Witness" was the play,
the occasion being the re-openlng of the
theater under Mr. Harry Bishop's man
agement. It would be distinctly disre
spectful to forget to mention Mr. Bish
op's, handsome new carpets, thick and
rosy as a cherry-colored lawn. Red, also,
are the wallsâ almost as red as "The Eye
Witness." Even the box office is bronzed
anew. In fact, the spacious uptown house
is now one of the" most attractive thea
ters In town.
But to "The Eye "Witness"â wfld horses
could not keep me away from "The Eye
Witness." It Is Lincoln J. Carter'sâ not
"Nick's," though one would never notice
itâ and there is everything In It that
other melodramas have not. Also, there
is everything In It that every other melo
drama contains. The chief "situation."
however, is Quite new In fact, of the
melodrama of the future. The long-lost
heroine !s escaping. She and the male
soubrette ar# automobillng it over the
Jack Knife bridge. Turn, r-r-r-r-r, turn,
goes the orchestra, a la Richard Strauss.
The villain, a blonde beastâ only he is a
brunetteâ who allows nothing to stand in
his way, knocks the drawbridge man Into
the mkldle of next week as a starter.
Then he up-ends the bridge. Does thi3
deter the noblo rescuer? No. sir! Some
more turn r-r-r-r-r, from the orchestra
and toot! toot! from the auto and lo! with
the dummy hero and heroine cinched to
the seat, over she went! The man behind
said he "never saw anything like it."
Neither had I. But then, for the laugh of
me, I couldn't see â¢ much of that.
It's all . the fault of the heroine, you
know. You see, in the first act her long
lost brotherâ there are so many long-lost
ersâ tells her he Is her brother. She has
been left by mamma In the care of the
O'Raffertys. Then mamma left. Oh.
no! she is quite respectable, only Insane.
But the b.erolne decides not to tell them
at once that the gentleman who has had
his arms round her most of the day Is her
brother. She has a little way of not tell
ing things. She has married George La
mont, for example, and forgotten to men
tion it. George Lamont Is, however,_the
son of her wicked paternal parent's
brother. Got It? It took me some time,
too. Brother thinks it is her papa's ille
gitimate son that she has married. Tells
her so. Quite Ibsen. Then she runs away
with brother, and the family, to whom
she has neglected to mention who brother
is, thinks that she has gone with a hand
somer man. And brother saya when sister
says that she will explain: "No. you arc
my sisterâ but you are a woman!"
The villain Is the aforementioned il
legitimate son of the -heroine's papa.
Ha is twice lovely. The way he sets
fire to the O'Rafferty mansion, chloro
forms the heroine and tells the work
ing villains to "drop the old woman
overboard and not forget to put on a
sinker" is beautiful. The hero goes
after the lady with the sinker. Quite
In the Rheingold fashion one sees the
hero plunge into the lake, seize the
heroine, who. with the sinker, has
sunk, and bear her nobly to the flies.
Oh. but It. Js exciting.
The company seemed to enjoy It as
much as we did and everybody had
flowers and fusillades of applause.
Robert Wayne as George Lamont could
not have been outdone In seriousness
by Mr. Mansfield as Baron Chevrial.
In other words. It was a thoroughly
workmanlike and likable performance
and one felt grateful to Mr. Wayne for
not '"guying" either himself or us- In
it. So with Ralph Cummings as the
villain John Lamont.
Miss Edna Archer Crawford, new
here, made a distinctly favorable Im
pression as. the heroine, giving: much
promise for the "chicken fare instead
of corned beef and cabbage always"
that the management promised last
night. Florence "Willis, who wore the
usual short frock and open-work hose
of the Central soubrettes. is that kind
of soubrette, and Marie Howe came to
renewed favor asÂ«the O'Rafferty lady.
George Seymour, the male Ingenue, is
a lively and spirited person, possessed,
lik*v the whole company, of presence
and good looks. Elmer Booth fur
nished a gHt-edge Irish accent as the
McKinney. In fact, there Is a rattling
good company at the Central and fun
for the millions in "The Eye-Witness."

WHEATâ There was nothing new anywhere
yesterday. It wes a holiday In Europe, and
it mleht as well have bÂ«en ln America for the
volume of trading done. Locally there was a
decline In futures of l .ic, but cash prices re
mained unchanged. A wire from Chicago said:
â¢"Tight money is against the bulls in Wheat,
besides this a bear help may b? mentioned,
a factor that Is now attracting the attention
of the entire epeculative world, and that Is
the almost entire absence of demand from
abroad for breadstuff* under these conditions,
coupled with Increasing supplies on every hand,
hence there is little to encourage the purchase
of wheat Just now. In case outstanding short
contracts are covered the market is sure to
advance, but It will take persistent buying
to hold prices. It la only necessary to glance
toward Argentine, with Its big wheat supplies,
in order to cauee a halt ln the buli movement.
There IÂ« nothing ln the Northwest situation
to encourage the bull.
"Where euch enormous Flour sales were being
maoii a short time ago millers now report
actual dullness. The effect Is most unfavor
ably felt In Flour prices, which. It is claimed,
are completely demoralized In some instances
by thÂ« great accumulation in Flour stocks that
millers have on hand."

Hay and Feedstuff*.
"Che Washington steamer brought down 5455
ctis Bran. There is nothins new in any de
scription. The circular of Scott & Magner
says :
"Arrivals of Hay during the week have been
31G5 tons, an Increase over the preceding few
weeks. The car situation apparently has eased
up some, so that much more Hay has come
in this week by cars than at any. time) during
the last couple of months. The arrivals hare
consisted of good grade Wheat Hay, and In
contequence this class Ip somewhat duller, and
slower of sale. There has not been as much
coming ln by water during this week of the
poorei classes of Hay. The entire feeling at
this time is of a holiday character. No one
is buying anything, except for immediate use.
Everybody is tigurlng to wait until after the
holidays before doing anything to any extent.
It Is expected, from information from Wash
ington, that Â« part of the recent Government
bid will be placed here. The larger part will
probably be placed for shipment from Seattle.
Choice Wheat Hay is holding its own very
well, although arrivals of this quality, have
continued to be light.
â¢Alfalfa Hay Is arriving moderately, and Is
readily Bold at quotations.
"Arrivals 'of Straw during . this week have
been more moderate. The demand is rather
light."

with buyers taking just about enough, to sat

ehowed but slight variation , from day to day.
The market for Potatoes closed very weak,
with a heavy accumulation of low grade stock
on hand.

Poultry- and Game.
Receipts of dressed Turkeys were much

developed a steadier tone. Attractive offerings
met with a good demand at well maintained !
rates, and the market vai well cleaned up
on good stock, at the close. The receipts from
Californlan and Oregon points were unusually
Ught this year, and but for the timely arrival
of several carloads of choice Eastern chilled
stock much higher prices would .have ruled
for domestic, fowls. Live- Poultry was""ln good

The demand is urgent.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
With local retailers and buyers from nÂ»ar
by towns laying ln supplies for three days'
wants. Christmas, the fruit market was quite
active, but trade was confined chiefly to
Oranges and high-grade Apples. Large well
colored Navels possessing sweetness were
wanted for the Christmas trade and ruled very
firm, with a few brands o f exceptionally Una
stock .commanding a substantial premium
Small fruit moved off a little better than pre
viously, but prices .showed no Improvement
All the other Citrus groods stood as previously
quoted. A few small consignments of choice
Grapes were received and quickly disposed of
at good prices. Five chests of Strawberries
were received, but, being , green and generally
unattractive, they found few buyers. A few

FHEXZIED FIXAN'CE
IX PORTO RICO
Application Made for Receiver of First
Loan Association on the
Island.
Upon the application of several share
holders of the People's Co-operative
Building, Saving and Loan Association of
Porto Rico, with headquarters in San
Juan, Acting Governor Post has appoint
ed William H. Hawkins, a San Juan
lawyer, as special judge to hear an appli
cation for the appointment of a receiver
for the association. For some time past
there have been rumors that all was not
right, and certain of the shareholders in
tlit association are demanding an Inves
tigation. The officers of the association
have of late refused to accept payments
on shares.
The concern was the first of Its kind ln
Porto Rico. It was organized just three
years ago and was authorized to have
$1,000,000 capital. It was promoted by G'n
eral William H. Elliot, now of Newcastle.
Ind., but who was then Commissioner of
the Interior for Porto Rico and who was
the first president of the enterprise. The
association was governed by a special law
and was subject to inspection by the
Treasurer of Porto Rico.
It guaranteed 8 per cent a year on its
investment certificates, and for a con
siderable time paid 1 per cent a month to
its shareholders. Its methods were simi
lar, to those of building and loan associa
tions in the States and its directorate is
composed of leading American and native
business men of. San Juan. One of these
directors says that with careful handling
of the funds the association should be
able to pay a large percentage of what
it owes.
During the last eighteen months the
concern has been involved in a big land
speculation in Santurce, on the outskirts
of San 3uan, and owns valuable property
there, on which six dwellings, one costing
510,000, and the Union Club's fine . JSOOO
clubhouse have been erected. At present
even an approximate statement of liabili
ties and assets cannot be procured.
The association induced many wage
earners to buy shares, and the failure of
the concern, if it finally goes to the wall,
will have a tendency to shake native
faith in American enterprises. If some of
the ugly rumors now afloat are true the
troubles of the association will soon lead
to the airing of somewhat frenzied finan
cial methods.â Chicago Chronicle.

SUPERANNUATED EMPLOYES
OP FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
Northwestern Xevcnpaer Favor* Uncle
Sana Having; a Penaton
List. \u25a0 , "
One feature of the overhauling: of ths
departments at Washington that will
prove embarrassing 1* the employment
of superannuated clerks.
Those who have vl3ited Washington
and have been through the various de
partmental buildings have necessarily
been struck by the number of very old
people employed there. Octogenarians
are plentiful, nonogenarians are not
scarce, and some of them look like cen
tenarians as they totter about their
work.
The spectacle is pathetic. The average
department clerk lives through life tzi a
vain effort to catch up with himself
financially, and no doubt many of these
aged servants are still dependent upon
their salaries. While a few, from the
exclusive knowledge of some detail of
the work that they may possess, are of
greater value because of their age and
long service, it must be confessed with
regret that most of them are simply pen
sioners, who are not physically able to do
the work that should be expected of
them.
The problem is going to bo whether it
is best to steel the heart and turn the
eyes away from the pathos of the situ
ation and discharge these ancient retain
ers, replacing them with people capable
of doing a day's work, or whether they
are to be kept on the salary list until
they totter to their deathbeds. While
this is merciful, it is at the expense of
public business and it would be far bet
ter to pension them outright and pay
younger persons to take their places.
The idea of a civil pension list has never
been popular with Congress, however,
and It is doubtful if It ever will be
adopted. The only solution of the future
would be a pension list to which tha em
ployes In the classified list would con
tribute, making a fund of which tha
Government would only be the custodian.
This would not help those now employed
who are too old to be made beneficiaries,
It might serve to require the crea
tion of such a pension fund for the fu
ture, and then retain the old-timers em
ployed at present until they drop out.
The problem is gt>ing to be- a factor in
the investigation, however, and it is a
delicate though perhaps not a vastly im
portant one.â Duluth Herald (Ind.)

Ordinarily a great fortune is built up
like a stone wall-a stone at a time. The
young man who declines to lay the first
stone because it comes so far short of a
â¢wall will never make progress in finan
cial masonry. An immense proportion of
the people of this country live up to thPir
incomes, laying aside nothing for the tra
ditional rainy day. Because they cannot
save $1000 In a bunch they save nothing.

been above taking care of the pennies

Felix Dolan Attempts to De

Where Coffin Is Placed
OAKLAND. Dec. 83. â Crazed from
the Â«>lTects of a prolonged debauch and
angered because he had been rebuked
for his behavior. Felix Dolan. a paint
er, last night attempted to wreck the
furniture in the room in which his
mother, Mrs. J. J. Gunnip, lay dead,
and whfii Ms stepfather, John J. Gun
nip, who is an employe of the South
ern Pacific Company, attempted to
ejf<t him from the house, turned upon
the latter and, forgetting the pres
ence of the dead, attacked him with
the fury of a. maniac. Gunnip, after
throwing Polan from the house, called
&it officer and had his Btepson ar
rested.
Sober and penitent. Dolan appeared
before Judge Samuels In department 2
of the Police Court this morning
and, trembling with terror and with
tear* in hUs eyes, begged for one more

MRS. MATTHEWS' BODY IS
TAKEN FROM THE GRAVE.
The remains of Mrs. Mary Matthew*, whose death in Oakland Coroner Mehrmann sus
pected was caused by a criminal operation, were removed from the grave 'yesterday. An
autopsy showed that Dr. Wilder's statement of the cause of death was wrong. He admitted ;
having removed one of the organs found to be missing from the body, but produced it. The
Coroner has consulted with the District Attorney.
Dr. Wilder's Diag
nosis Proves to
Be Wrong.
He Produces Organ
Autopsy Shows
Is Missing.
OAKLAND, Dec. 23â The body of Mrs.
Mary R. Matthews, who died here Tues
day and was buried the next day, was ex
humed by Deputy Coroner Van Y r &nken
this afternoon and an autopsy to-night
proved that one of the organs of the
woman's body had been removed.
Dr. C. 11. "Wilder, who attended tha
woman at the Central Hospital, admitted
that he had removed the organ, and said
he was privileged to do so in order to
protect himself. Coroner Mehrmann says
he had no right to mutilate a dead body
and that he is liable under the law for
that offense. The Coroner further says
that the autopsy proved that Dr. Wilder
did not give a correct diagnosis of the
case.
Mr*. Matthews was taken ill more than
a we*k ago at 517 San Pablo avenue, and
it is alleged that the inmates of the
building called Dr. Wilder, who had the
woman removed to the Central Hospital,
where she died last Tuesday. On Wednes
day, fifteen hours after she died, the
body was Interred in Mountain View
Cemetery. The next day her husband,
C. T. Matthews, appeared in Oakland and
demanded that the body be exhumed,
declaring that his wife had evidently
died from an ilk gal operation.
Matthews said his wife had deserted
him and their two children and had
artpfl as housekeeper for N*. G. Madson
of Paso Robles. Acting upon his sug
gestion. Coroner Mehrmann ordered the
body exhumed and to-night an autopsy
was held by Drs. Hamlln. Reinle and
Curtis. The autopsy Furgeons found that
one of the woman's organs had been re
moved and that she had died from septl
cemia. They could lind no trace of menin
gitis, the disease from which Dr. Wilder
said phe had died.
Neither could they find any trace of
absceÂ«s, which Dr. Wilder wrote In the
death certificate as a contributory
cause. The autopsy proved that Dr.
Wilder"s diagnosis of the case was wrong
and Coroner Mehrmann will consult with
District Attorney Al'en with a view to
taking further sUps in the case.
When the autopsy was held this even
ing. Dr. Wilder appeared with the organ
of the woman j=<"a!Â«Â»d in a bottle, although
hÂ» stated last night that he had not mu
tilated the body. He said he had tried to
protect himself and stated that he had
signed a death certificate, regardlesÃ of
the Coroner's instructions, to avoid no
toriety.
The police, acting on information from
Mr?. 11. E. Graff. Detective Frank Lynch
having interviewed her. notified Chief Di
nan of San Francisco that if a crime had
been committed in Mrs. Matthews' case
it was committed in San Francisco. Mrs.
Graff said she had accompanied Mrs.
Matthews to the office of a Dr. Leek, a
dentist of that city, where Mrs. Mat
thews was operated upon. With relation
to that visit lite. Graff said to-night:
About a month ago <I do not remember the
pxact dai*) J went to the office of Dr. Leek.
in San Rranctoci*. We were accompanied by
Mrs T It McDlarmld. who lives at the St.
Nicholas Houw in this <ity. On arriving: at

in the reception room and went into the ope
rating room, remaining thorn tor several rnin

MOTHER OF AUTHOE
LAID AT FINAL REST
OAKX.AXD. Dec. 23.â The funeral of
Mrs Margaret Miller, the aged mother
of Joaquln Miller, "Poet of the Sierra,"
was held at noon to-day at the home
of the author on Oakland Heights, the
remains being laid to rest in the beau
tiful burying ground on the hill in the
rear of the Miller home. Many friends
of the deceased, who had become inti
mately acquainted with her during her
long residence In Alameda County,
journeyed to the mountain home to
pay their last respects to the memory
of one who had endeared herself to all
who knew her in life and to render a
tribute of love, the last she would
ever receive on earth.
The services were very simple and
their very simplicity made them the
more beautiful. Following the singing
of the opening hymn, Joaquin Miller
himself paid a touching tribute to the
virtues of the parent who had been
his companion for so many years, and
two funeral hymns were sung by those
attending the services at the close of
his remarks. A Japanese friend of the
poet then recited the Lord's prayer.
The services were closed with Â»en ad
dress by Colonel John P. Irish, who
for many years had been an intimate
friend of the deceased and her gifted
son.
At the close of an Invocation by the
Rev. Franklin Rhoda, who conducted
the funeral services, the remains were
borne up the hill to the little private
burying ground, where they were laid
at rest beside those of Maud Miller,
the daughter of the poet, who was
borne to her last resting place on
Christmas day four years ago.

HELD CULPABLE
OAKLAND, Dec. 23.â A decision In
volving damages said to aggregate
$164,000 was rendered to-day in favor
of Nlehaus Bros, of West Berkeley
against the Contra Costa Water Com
pany by Judge John Ellsworth in an
action in which it was shown that at
the time of the breaking out of a fire
in plaintiff's mill there, was no water
in the mains. The damages have not
yet been fixed, as the only point sub
mitted at present "was as to the lia
bility of the company. . Further hear
ing of the case for the purpose of
showing the damage has been set for
January 8.
The case Is one of the most impor
tant decided here In years. Weeks
have been spent in the trial of it. Rep
resenting Niehaus Bros, was W. S.
Goodfellow, while for the water com
pany Samuel Knight of San Francisco
and â¢M. C. Chapman of this city ap
peared. The suit was based on the
fact that the plaintiffs had been pay
ing, the water company for special
stand. pipes to be used in case of fire
and when a fire did start In the mill
there was no water to fight it with,
and the entire. property was lost.
The fire occurred on the night of
August, lÃ, 1901. and an Inventory of
!the property , consumed, taken '-Imme
diately after the fire/ together, with the
loss of business, occasioned .the owners
to reach an appraised total of $164,000.
This phase of the case, however, was
left ; by agreement until .the liability
of the company had been passed upon.
The' Judge will now hear evidence as
to the value of the property destroyed.
.What occasioned ;the lack of. water
in. the pipes was not made evident dur
ing the trial of the case, but Judge
jEllsworth,. in \u25a0 rendering . j hla opinion,
stated : that it was. not : necessary for
the plaintiff -to â¢'. show this, as ; it was
shown- that the water was In the pipes,
a short time before the fire and was
there a short time after it.

PAYNE WRITES
TO FILIPINOS
New York's â¢ Eepresentative
Tells of Changed Opinion
as to the Philippines
NOT READY TO GOVERN
Presents ExteiflLed Article
on His Views Concerning
the Political Conditions
BERKELEY, Dec. 23.â 1n the Filipino
Students' Magazine, the official organ of
the Filipinos in America, issued froni the
University of California to-day, is a sig
nificant article on the "Philippine Prob
lem," by Congressman Sereno E. Payne
of New York. Representative Payne was
one of the original anti-imperialists. In
his article in the Filipinos' own; paper
he announces his changed ppinions and
now says that the Filipinos as a people
are unfit for self-government and that at
least 100 years will be necessary before
they will be able to take the reins of gov
ernment into their own hands.
Congressman Payne was a member of
the party of distinguished Congressmen
and Cabinet officers who visited the Phil
ippines last summer. In part he says:
"I suppose it is well known -that 1 did
not favor the acquisition of the Philip
pine Islands. It was only when, after
careful investigation, I was convinced
that there was no other way, that we had
destroyed the only government which the
islands had and that we were leaving
them to anarchy and confusion; that 1
was content that we should assume what
seemed to be a duty imposed upon us and
accapt the 'white man's burden' there.
That it is a burden no one will deny.
That it will be. a burden for years no one
who has visited the islands and made a
thorough examination will question.
"There is some sentiment for an inde
pendent government. This arises among
agitators, whom Commissioner Luzurlaga
calls half-educated persons, and who are
out of a job and want to participate in a
new government. They tell people, as
some of them told us, taking up each tax
by iUelf j that they would abolten jr.
Thenthey tell them, as they told us. that
they would immediately commence to
build a navy and an army to defend
themselves, and, "of course, every ignorant
man who has to pay-a tax is pleased with
the idea of a government which will ex
empt them. They do not stop to think
that they cannot get revenue without
taxation and cannot build a navy and
equip an army without money. E.en one
of the forrmost of their agitators, when 1
asked how he was going to do this,
seemed surprised. The question evidently
had not entered his brain before that.
They are not ready for self-government;
there is hardly a fraction of one per cent
of. them that is ready. The men who
appeared before us to advocate it demon
strated their own unfltness.
"Their reasoning was such as you
would expect from a boy of 12 years.
Aguinaldo is an ordinary man; whose
argument, printed and distributed to
us In favor of an agricultural bank
to be capitalized by the United. States
by a loan of $300,000,000. a problem
which he had been working on for
years, demonstrates the weakness of
his mental powers. The best men
among them, selected as Commission
ers for their judgment and good sense;
the Chief Justice,- an able lawyer and
a native, and the Governors and Presi
dent selected by "the intelligent por
tion of .'the- people, say that they won't
be fit for self-government in twenty
live years.
"Some of the advocates of immediate
independence told Secretary Taft two
years ago that they, had demonstrated
to their own ( satisfaction that they
had the men capable of governing the
islands. Th"tey had made, a list of the
offices in the new Government and had
canvassed the people who could prop
erly fill them, and found they 'had
enough for two shifts of officers.'
"The United States started 'out to
unify the people by teaching them all
the. English language. So far their
success In this direction has been
phenomenal. Yet, it has been confined
mainly to the children. More than
twice as many of the people speak
English than those who speak Spanish.
They learn the language readiJy and
are eager to learn. Another genera
tion will find a vast majority of the
people of all the islands able to com
municate In the English language.
Agitators say that only a few are fit to
govern; the great mass must obey.
Their Idea of a republic is an oligarchy.
Judging from the past, such an
oligarchy would be the worst affliction
that could come to the Filipino people.
"The task of raising them to a posi
tion where they can govern themselves
is most difficult. There are some hope
ful signs that it may come In time, but
the most optimistic could hardly ex
pect it in less than a hundred years. It
was interesting to note the change in
feeling of those of the party who had
been advocating independence. One of
them said on his return that it was
an "iridescent dream." Another said
that he was in favor of sustaining the
Government and jojnlng hands to work
out- the problem, which he- believed
would require) an indefinite length of
time. . Another said he was convinced
that we ought to take the question en
tirely out of politics."
RISKS LIFE TO SAVE-.
WRECKED MARINERS
A'ICTORIA, B. C. Dec. 23.â News
reached Victoria in the Australian mall
to-day of the wreck of the barkentine
Lebella near Warnboolon on the Aus
tralian Coast, Involving; the loss of
several lives and the display of brav
ery, by a fisherman named .William
Ferrier, which caused him to be famed
throughout: Australia as a hero. The
Lebella struck half a mile from shore
on a reef. Her distressed condition
and the men clinging to her rigging
were seen : with glasses froni 'shore.
The local lifeboat went out, but some
of the crew were in hospital and the
volunteers failed to reach the wreck and
efforts to throw a line from shore with
rocket apparatus failed. The wreck was
breaking to pieces and the sailors falling
to death one by one. Then William Fer
rier put out alone in a small dingy scull,
with a single oar. He was nearly swamp
ed, but managed his craft successfully
and rescued one man, who proved to be
the captain. He was landed and Ferrier
made another, trip, \ rescuing another man
so'overcome' by exposure that he was in
capable of helping himself. In the mean
time the lifeboat had managed to rescue
the survivors. Ferrier has been present
ed with medals and purses by admiring
citizens because of ; hia heroism.'

QUEER MISTAKE
OF A JOURNAL
English Paper Says "Outside
of Stanford Memorial Chap
el Has Been Used asCanvas"
DESCRIBES WORK OF ART
How Imported Labor Has
Completed Wonderful Pic
ture on Walls of Church
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Dec. 23.â
That the fame of the magnificent Stan
ford Memorial Church has spread unttf. -
distant Iand3 was amusingly demorr^ii
strated by an article in a recent is3ue
of the Christian Age. a religious journal
published in London, England. The fame
of the -wonderful mosaics that panel tha
Interior of the church and aÂ«Jorn its ex
terior had lost its significance by the
time It reached the Christian Age, for
that paper. In speaking of the work off thÂ«
Italian artists, labors under the impres
sion that the exterior of th<9 church has
been made ths substitute for a painter's
canvas.
"There Is possibly no Instance In this
country," says the \u25a0writer, "of thÂ« ex
terior of a church being used as a substi
tute for the painter's canvas, but sucli
an Instance i* to be found in Palo Altn,
California. The Stanford Memorial
Church In this town is unique- in the re
spect that the front of the church has
been used as a canvas for a most beauti
ful and realistic painting of the 'Sermon
on the Mount.*
"The execution of this wonderful paint
ing was naturally a long and exacting
task, and the funds for the erection of thÂ«
church with its unique adornment were
provided by a wealthy American lady,
whose idea it was to keep fresh the recol
lection of the Sermon on the Mount In
this manner."
In reality the decoration on ths uni
versity church Is the finest and most
carefully executed piece of mosaic work
In this country. The men who put in
place the thousands of pieces of stone
that go to make up thÂ« different allegori
cal figures were brought over from
Italy at great expense for that express^
purpose and their work is thÂ» admiration
of the hundreds of tourists who visit
Stanford monthly.
BELGIUM AGAIN AGITATED
BY A ROYAL. SCANDAL
Report that Leopold Will W>d Former
\u25a0r .Barmaid, Proclaiming Her
Son Heir.
BRUSSELS, Dec. 23.â A report about
an alleged project of King Leopold
is causing the greatest agitation at
court and In high political circles her*.
and it is probable that. If tha rumor
prove true. It may cause a revolution.
Leopold's relations with, tha noto
rious 'Queen of the . Congo." whosa
erstwhile residence !a~ the Avenua
Louise is one of the sights of Brussels,
are a matter of notoriety, but this
woman's career has ended as far aa
royal protection Is concerned, and she
now occupies a eorafortabla position as
wife of a Belgian officer. The present
recipient of royal favors Is a hand
some French woman, daughter of re
spectaule parents In the south of
France. She served as a barmaid for
some years in a hotel at Bordeaux be
fore she came to Brussels. About t^vo
years ago Princess Clementine, the
King's only unmarried daughter, met
this woman in the grounds at Laekken
and ordered her off, suspecting she was
there for no good purpose.
"I have just as much right to be
here as you have," was the curt reply.
An altercation ensued, when the Kins
happened to come up. and grasping the
situation, peremptorily directed his
daughter to retire to her apartments.
Since then father and daughter have
never been seen together in public,
and a separate establishment near tho
palace has been fitted up for the Prin
cess.
The latest development of this In
trigue forms the subject of- anxious
speculation. It appears that the King
hired a villa at Vlllefranche, near Nice,
for this woman and has repeatedly
visited her and her reputed husband
there. This woman has Ju3t given
birth to a son, and rumor has it that
the King seriously thought of making
her his wife and proclaiming the child
his son and heir to the crown of Bel
gium.
The most extraordinary part of the
story Is that there Is nothing In the
Belgian constitution to prevent thÂ©
King from following this fancy, and
there is certainly no obstacle In his
own sense of decency.
â¢The absence of a direct heir has al
ways been a grief to the King since he
lost his eldest son, and he would much
prefer not to see his nephew, Prince
Albert of Flanders, ascend the Â«hronÂ«*.
The lengths to which family anlmosity
carries him have been shown in hi 3
ruthless treatment of his own children.
Thi3 extraordinary Intrigue is covert
ly referred to In to-day's Issue of the
Socialist Peuple. which speaks of a
royal "offshoot" as likely to come be
tween the heir presumptive and the
throne. The result of such attempt
would be either that the monarchy
would be overthrown and a republic \u25a0
established, or Prince Albert would be
declared King. despite Leopold*
schemes.
