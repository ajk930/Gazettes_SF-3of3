THE key of B flat has two Hat-, and in this
lesson, the ninth of the series, the
show how to play accompaniments in the"
key of B flat and its relative, the key of (j
minor. Place one of the charts at right angles
with the keyboard, so that the small letter
D with a dash above it on the chart is directly
over Don the keyboard. Then the white spaces
on the chart will be over the white keys and black
spaces over the black keys. The top, middle and
lower sections on the lower chart represent tin:
three chords, a mastery of wtiich will enable any
one to accompany on the piano any song or
melody in the key of B flat, and the upper charr
represents the chords of the key of G minor. The
black letters are to be played with the left hand,
the colored letters with the right hand.*
Sow having placed the chart on the piano, play
the. black letter on the lop section with the left
hand and then the three colored letters in unison
with the right hand. Next play the middle section
in the same way, then the lower section and then
â¢ return to the top section. The small letter D with
i a dash above it, which gives the chart position,
must not be played. After a brief practice these
chords can be memorized and you may play with
out the use of the chart. But with.the chart a
person who never struck a note on the piano be
fore may in a few minutes play the harmonious
chords correctly .and. .then accompany his or her
own songs or the songs of friends.
Proficiency requires a little practice, but no pre
vious knowledge of music.
It you wish to delve deeply into the mysteries of
music the charts give you the best possible foun
dation on which to base a imisical education. A
knowledge of the keys and their chords underlies
all the triumphs of the accomplished musician.

CHAPTER X.
On Board the Galley.
Rosamund was led from the Hall of
Steeple acrosa the meadow down to the
quay at Steeple Creek, where a great
boat waitedâthat of which the brethren
liad found the impress in the
in this the band embarked, placing
their dead and wounded, with one or
two to tend them, in the fishing skiff
that had belonged to her father. This
skiff having been made fast to the stern
of the boat, they pushed off, and iv
utter silence rowed down the creek
till they reached the tidal stream of
the blackwati r, where they turned their
bow seaward. Through the thick
night and the falling snow slowly they
ielt their way along, sometimes row
ing, sometimes drifting, while the false
palmer Nicholas steered them. The
journey proved dangerous, for they
could scarcely see the shore, although
they keM as close to it as they dared.
The end of it was that they grounded
on a mud bank, and, do what they
would, could not thrust
free. Now hope rose in the heart of
Rosamund, who sat still as a statue in
the middle of the boat, the Prince
Hassan at her side and the armed men
âtwenty or thirty of themâall about
her. Perhaps, she thought, they would
remain fast there till daybreak, and be
seen and rescued when the brethren
woke from their drugged sleep. But
Hassan read her mind, and said to her
gently enough:
"Be not deceived, lady, for I must
tell you that if the worst comes to the
worst, we shall place you in the little
skiff and go on, leaving the rest to take
their chance."
As it happened, at the full tide they
floated off the bank and drifted with
the ebb down toward the sea. At the
first break of dawn she looked up, and
there, looming large in the mist, lay a
galley, anchored in the mouth of the

looked at him In the'faint light
Jkr.il I;r blood went cold. It was the
it Lozelle.
"You here, Sir Hugh," she gasped.
"Where you are, there I am," he
answered, with a sneer upon his coarse,
handsome face. "Did I not swear that
it should be so, beauteous Rosamund,
after your saintly cousin worsted me
in the fray?"
"You here," she repeated, "you a
Christian knight, and in the pay of Sa
ladin!"
"In the pay of any one who leads me
to you, Rosamund." Then, seeing the
emir Hassan approach, he turned to
give some orders to the sailors, and
she passed on to the cabin and in her
agony fell upon her knees.
When Rosamund rose from them she
felt that the ship was moving, and, de
siring to look her last on Essex land,
went out again upon the poop, where
Hassan and Sir Hugh plated them
selves, one upon either side of her.
Then it was that she saw the tower
of St. Peter-on-the-wall and her cous
ins seated on horseback in front of it,
the light of the sun shining upon their
mail. Also she saw Wulf spur his
horse Into the sea and faintly heard
his great cry of "Fear not! We fol
low, we follow!"
A thought came to her, and she
sprang toward the bulwark; but they
were watching and held her, so that all
that she cculd do was to throw up her
arms in token.
Now the wfnd caught the sail and the
ship went forward swiftly, so that soon
she lost sight of them. Then in* her
grief and rage Rosamund turned upon
Sir Hugh Lozelle and beat him with
bitter words till he shrank before her.
"Coward and traitor!" she said. "So
It was you who planned this, knowing
every secret of our home, where often
you were a guest! You who for Pay
nim gold have murdered my father, not
daring to show your face before his
6word, but hanging like a thief upon
the coast, ready to receive what braver
men had stolen. Oh! may God avenge
his blood and me on you, false knight
âfalse to him and me and faith and
honor âas avenge he will! Heard you
not what my kinsman called to me?
'We follow, we follow!' Yes, they fol
low and their swordsâthose swords
you feared to look onâshall yet pierce
your heart and give up your soul to
your master, satin," and she paused,
trembling with her righteous wrath,
while Hassan stared at her and mut
tered:
0 "By Allah,, a princess indeed! So
have I seen Salah-ed-din look in his
sage. Yes, and she has his very eyes."
J But Sir Hugh answered in a thick
voice.
. "Let them follow âone or both. I
fear them not arid out there my foot
Will not slip in the snow."
r "Then I say that it shall slip In the
sand or on a rock," she anwswered,
#.nd turning, fled to the cabin and cast
herself down and wept till she
thought that her heart would break.
Well might Rosamund weep whose
beloved sire was slain, who was torn
from her home to find herself in the
power of a man she hated. Yet there
was hope for her. Hassan, Eastern
trickster as he might be, was her
friend; and her uncle, Saladin. sÂ§
least, would never wish that she
should be ashamed. Most like he
knew nothing of this man Lozelle, ex
cept as one of those Christian traitors
who were ever ready to betray the
cross for gold. But Saladin was far
away and her home lay behind her,
nnd her cousins and lovers were eat
ing out their hearts upon that fading
fehore. And sheâone woman aloneâ
was on this ship with the evil man
Lozelle, who thus had kept his prom
ise, and there were none save Easterns
to protect her, none save themâand
God, who had permitted that such
things should be.
The ship swayed, she grew sick and
faint. Hassan brought her food with
his own hands, but she loathed it who
only desired to die. The day turned to
night, the night turned to day again,
and always Hassan brought her food
and strove to comfort her, till at
length she remembered no more.
Then came a long, long sleep, and in
the sleep dreams of her father stand
ing with his face to the foe and
sweeping them down with his long
sword as a sickle sweeps cornâof her
father felled by the pilgrim kiiave,
dying upon the floor of his own houst?
and saying: ' God will guard you. His
will be done." Dreams of Godwin and
Wulf also fighting to save her, plight
ing their troths and swearing their
oaths, and between the dreams',black
ness.
Rosamund awoke to feel the sun
streaming warmly through the shutter
of her cabin, and to see a woman who
held a cup in her hand watching herâ
a stout woman of middle age with a not
unkindly face. She looked about her
and remembered all. Â«6o she was still in
the ship. .
â¢'Whence tome you?" she asked the
"From France, lady. This ship put in
at Marseilles, and there I was hired to
nurse one who lay sick, which suited
me very well, as I wished to go to Jeru
salem to seek my husband, and good
money was offered me. Still, had I
known that they were all Saracens on
this ship I am not sure that I should
have comeâthat is,-except the captain,
Sir Hugh, and the palmer Nicholas;
though what they, or you either, are
doing in such company I cannot guess."
"What is your name?" asked Rosa
mund idiy. â¢
"MarieâMarie Boucher. -My husband
is a fish-monger, or was, until one of
those crusading priests got hold of him
and took him off to kill Paynims and
save his soul, much against my will.
Well, I promised him that if he did not
return in five years I would come to
look for him. So here am I, but whers
he may be is another matter." '
"It is brave of you to go." said Rosa
mund, thep added by an afterthought,
"how long is it since we left Mar-i
sellles?" '
Marie counted on her fat fingers and
answered:
"Fiveânearly six weeks. You have
been wandering in your mind all that
time, talking of many strange things,
and we have called at three ports. I
forget their names, but the last one
was an island with a beautiful harbor.
Now, in about twenty days, if all goes
well, we should reach another island
called Cyprus. But you must not talk
so much, you must sleep. The Saracen
called Hassan, who is a clever doctor,
told The so." /
So Rosamund slept, and from that
time forward, floating on the calm
Mediterranean Sea, her strength began
to come back again rapidly, who was
young and strong in body and constitu
tion. Three days later she was helped
to the deck, where the first man she
saw was Hassan, who came forward to
greet her with many Eastern saluta
tions and Joy written on his dark, wrin
kled face.
"I give thanks to Allah ror your sake
and my own," he said. "For yours
that you still live whom I thought
would die. and for mtself that had you
died your life would have been required
at my hands by Salah-ed-din, my mas
ter."
"If so, he should have blamed Azrael,
not you," answered .Rosamund, smil
ing; then suddenly turned cold, for
before her was Sir Hugh Lozelle, who
also thanked heaven that she had.re
covered. She listened to him coldly,
and presently he went away, but soon
was at her side again. Indeed, she
could never be free of .him, for when
ever she appeared on dedk he was
there, nor could he be repelled, since
neither silence nor rebuff would stir
him. Always he sat near, talking in
his false, hateful voice, and devouring
her with the greedy eyeÃ which she
could feel fixed upon her face. With
him often was his jackal, the false
Nicholas, who crawled about her like
a snake and strove'to flatter her, but
to this man she would never speak a
word.
At last she could bear it no longer,
and, when her health had returned to
her, summoned Hassan to her cabin.
"Tell me, Prince," she said, "who
rules upon this vessel?"
"Three people," he answered, bowing.
"The knight. Sir Hugh Lozelle, wlio.
as a skilled navigator, is the captain
and rules the sailors; I, who rule the
fighting men; and you, Princess, who
rule us all." . <
"Then I command that the rogue
named Nicholas shall not be allowed
toÂ»approach me. Is it to be borne that
I must associate with my father's mur
derer?" i
"I fear that In that business we all
had a band, nevertheless your order
shall be obeyed. To tell you the truth,
lady, I hate the fellow, who is but a
common spy."
"I desire, also," went.on Rosamund,
"to sneak no more with Sir Hugh Lo
zelle."
"That is more difficult," said Hassan,
"since he is the captain whom my
master ordered me. to obey in all
things that have to do with the ship."
"I have nothing to do with the ship,"
answered Rosamund, "and surely the
Princess of Baalbec, if so I am, may
choose her own companions. I wish
to see mote of you and less of Sir
Hugh Lozelle-" /
"I am honored," replied Hassan, "and
will do my best."
For some days after this, although
he was always watching her, Lozelle
approached Rosamund but seldom, and
whenever he did so he found Hassan
at her side, or rather standing behind
her like a guard.
At length, as it chanced, the Prince
was taken with a sickness from drink
ing bad water which held him to his
bed for some days, and then Lozelle
feund his opportunity. Rosamund
strove to keep in her cabin to avoid
him, but the heat of the summer sun
In the Mediterranean drove her out of it
to a place beneath an awning, on the
poop, where she sat with the worn

an Marie. Here Lozelle approached
her. pretending- to bring her food or
to inquire after her comfort, but she
would answer him nothing. At length,
since Marie could understand what he
said in French, he addressed her in
Arabic, which he spoke well, but she
feigned not to understand him. Then
h6 used the English tongue as it was
talked among the common people In
Essex and said:
"Lady, how sorely you misjudge me.
What is.my crime against you? I am
an Essex man of good lineage, who
met you' in Essex and learnt to love
you there. Is that a crime, in one who
is not poor, who, moreover, was
knighted for his deeds by no mean
hand? Your father said me nay, and
you said me nay, and, stung by my
disappointment and his words âfor he
called me sea-thief and raked up old
tales that are not true against meâl
talked 'as I should not have done,
swearing that 1 would wed you yet in
spite of all. For this I was called to
account with justice, and your cousin,
the young kmght Godwin, who was
then a squire, struck me in the face.
Well, he worsted and wounded me, for
tune favoring him, and I departed with
my vessel to the East, for that is my
business, to trade between Syria and
England.
"Now, as It chanced, there being
peace at the time between the Sultan
and the Christiana, I visited Damascus
to buy merchandise. While I was there
Saladin sent for me and asked me if it
<vere true that I belonged to a part of
England called Essex. When I an
swered yes, he asked if I knew Sir An
drew d'Arcy and his daughter. Again
I said yes, whereon he told me that
strange tale of your kinship to him of
which I had heard already; also a still
stranger tale of some dream that he
had dreamed concerning you, which
made'it necessary that you should be
brought to his court, where he was
minded to raise you to great honor. In
the end he offered to hire my finest
ship for a large sum. if I would sail it
to England to fetch you; but he did.not
tell me that any force was to be used,
and I, on my part, said that I would
lift no hand against you or your
father, nor indeed have I done so."
"Whe- remembered the swords of
Godwin and Wulf." broke in Rosa
mund scornfully, "and preferred that
braver men should face them."
. "Lady." answered Loselle, coloring,
"hitherto none of accused me of a lack
of courage. Of your courtesy, listen, I
pray you. I did wrong to enter on this
business; but lady, it was love for you
that drove me to it, for the thought of
this long voyage In your company was
a bait I could not withstand."
"Paynim gold was the bait you
could not withstandâthat is what you
mean. Be brief, I pray you. I weary
of this talk."
"Lady, you are harsh and misjudge
me, as I will showâ" and he looked
about him cautiously. "Within a week
from now, if all goes well, we cast an
chor In Limazol, in Cyprus, before we
run to a secret port near Antioch,
whence you are to be taken overland to
Damascus, avoiding all cities of the
Franks. Now, the Emperor Isaac of
Cyprus is my friend, and over him Sal
adin has no power. Once in his court
you would be safe until such time as
you found opportunity to return to
England. This, then, is my planâthat
you should escape from the ship at
night,'as I can arrange."
"And what is your payment," she
asked, "who are a merchant knight?"
"My payment, lady, isâyourself. In
* Cyprus we will be wedâoh? think be
fore you answer. At Damascus many
dangers await you; with me you will
find safety and a Christian husband
who loves you wellâso well that for
your sake he is willing to lose his ship
and, what is more, to break faith with
Saladln, whose arm is long."
"Have done," she said coldly. "Soon
er will I trust myself to an honest Sar
acen than to you, Sir Hugh, whose
spurs, if you met, your desert, should
be hacked from you by scullions. Yes,
sooner would I take death for my lord
than you, who for your own base ends
devised the plot that brought my
father to his murder and me to slavery.
Have done, I say, and never dare
again to speak of love to me, who hate
you," and, rising, she walked past him
to her cabin.
But Lozelle, looking after her, mut
tered to himself, "Nay, fair lady, I have
but begun; nor will I forget your bit
ter words, for which you shall pay the
merchant knight in kisses."
From her cabin Rosamund sent a
message to Hassan, saying that she
would speak with him.
He came,' still pale with illness, and
asked her will, whereon she told him
what had passed between Lozelle and
herself, demanding his protection
against this man. Hassan's eyes
flashed.
"Yonder he stands," he said, "alone.
Will yon come with me and speak to
him?"
She bowed her head, and giving her
his hand, he led her to the poop.
"Sir captain," he began, addressing
Lozelle, "the PrinceÃs here tells me a
strange storyâthat you have dared-to
offer your love to her, by Allah! to her,
a niece of Salah-ed-din."
% H-ftiter l|^&ra.
"What of It, Sir Saracen?" answered
Lozelle, insolently. "Is ntot a Christian
knight fit mate for the blood .of an
Eastern chief? Had I offered her less
than marriage, you might have spo
ken."
"You!" answered Hassan, with rage
in his low voice, "you,, huckstering
thief and renegade, who swear by Ma
homet in Damascus and by your pro
phet Jesus in Englandâaye, deny it
not, I have heard you, as I have heard
that rogue Nicholas, your servant.
You, her fit mate? Why, were it not
that you must guide this ship, and that
my master bade me not Quarrel with
you till your task was done, I would
behead you now and cut from your
throat the tongue that dared to speak
such words," and as he spoke he
gripped the handle of his scimitar.
Lozelle quailed before his fierce eyes,
for well he knew Hussan, and knew
a]y> that if it came to fighting- his sail
ors were no match for the his
picked Saracens.
"When our duty is done you shall
answer for those words," he said, try
ing to look brave.
"By Allah! I hold you to the prom
ise," replied Hassan. "Before Salah
ed-din I will answer for them when and
where you will, as you shall answer to
him for your treachery."
"Of what, then, am I accused?" asked
LozeHe. "Of loving the lady Rosa
mund, as do all menâperhaps your
self, old and withered as you are,
among them?"
"Aye, and for that crime I will repay
you, old and withered as I am. Sir
Renegade. But with Salah-ed-din you
have another score to settleâthat by
promising her escape you tried to se
duce her from this ship, where you
were sworn to guard her. saying that
you would find her refuge among the
Greeks of Cyprus."
"Were this true," replied Lozelle,
"the Sultan might have cause of com
plaint against me. But it is not true.
Harken, since speak I must. The lady
Rosamund, prayed me to do this deed,
and I told her that for my honor's
sake U is not possible, although it was
true that I loved her now as always,
and would dare much for her. Then
she said that if I did but save her
from you Saracens. I should not go
without my reward, since she would
wed me. Again, although it cost me
sore, I answered that it might not be,
but when once I had brought my ship
to land, I was her true knight, and
being freed of my oath, would do my
best to save her."
"Princess, you hear," said Hassan,
turning to Rosamund. "What say
you?"
"I say," she answered coldly, "that
this man lies to save himself. I say,
moreover, that I said to him, that
sooner would I die than he should lay
a finger on me."
"I hold also that he lies," said Has
san. "Nay; unclasp not that dag
ger if you would live to see
another sun. Here, I will not fight
with you, but Salah-ed-dln shall
Jearn all this case when we reach
his court, and judge between the
word of the Princess of Baalbec and of
his hired servant, the false Frank and
pirate, Sir Hugh Lofcelle."
Let him learn itâwhen we reach
his court," answered Lozelle, with
meaning; then added, "Have you aught
else to say to me, Prince Hassan? Be
cause, if not, I must be attending to
the business of my ship, which you
suppose that I was about to abandon
to win a lady's, love,"
"Only this, that the ship is the Sul
tan's and not yours, for he bought it
from you, and that henceforth this lady
will be guarded day and night, and
doubly guarded when we come to the
shores of Cyprum, where it seem that
you have friends/ Understand and re
member."
"I understand, and certainly I will
remember," replied Lozelle, and so
they parted. â¢
"I think," said Rosamund, when he
had gone, "that we shall be fortunate
if we land safe in Syria."
"That was in my mind, also, lady I
think, too, that I have forgot my wis
dom, but my heart rose against this
man, and being still weak from sick
ness, I lost my judgment and spoke
what was In my heart, who would have
done better to wait. Now, perhaDs it
will be best to kill him. if it were not
that he alone has the skill tft navigate
the chip, which Is a trade that he has
followed from his youth. Nay let it
go as Allah wills. He is juat, and will
bring the matter to Judgment in due
â¢time.'
"Yes, but to what judgment?" asked
Rosamund.
"I hope to that of the sword " an
swered Hassan, as he bowed and left
her.
Prom that time forward armed men
watched all the night through before
Rosamund s cabin, and when she
walked tne deck armed men walked
after her Nor was she troubled by
Lozelle, who sought to speak with her
no more, or to Hassan either Only
with the man Nicholas he spoke much.
At length upon one golden eveningâ
for Lozelle was a skillful pilot, one of
the best. Indeed, who sailed those seas,
they came to the shores of Cyprus and
east anchor. Before them, stretched
alone; the beach, lay the white tow n of
Limazol, with palm trees standing up
amidst its gardens, while beyond the
fertile plain rose the mighty mountain
range of Troc-idos. Sick and weary of
the endless ocean. Rosamund ' gazed
with rapture at this green and beau
teous shore, the home of so much mys
tery, and sighed to think that on it she
might not set her foot. Lozelle saw her
look and heard her sign", and as hÂ«
climbed into the boat which had come
out to row him into the harbor, mocked
her, saying:
"Will you not chance your mind,
lady, and come with me to visit my
friend, the Emperor Isaac? I swear
that his court is gay. not packed fui!
of sour Saracens or pilgrims thinking
of their â¢ntelft, In Cyprus .hey only
make pilgrimages to Paphos yonder,
where Venus was born from out the
foani.V and has reigned since the rrr
ginning of the worldâaye. and will
reign- until its end."
Rosamund made no answer, and Lo
zelle, descending into the boat, was
rowed shoreward through ihe break
ers by the dark-skinned, Cyprian oars
men, who wore flowers in their hair,
and as they labored at the oars.
For ten wholo days they rolled off
Llmazol. although the weather was
fair and the -wind blt;w straight for
Syria. When Rosamund asked why
they bided there so long. Hassan
stamped his foot and said it was be
cause the Emperor refused to snpply
them with more food or water than
was sufficient for their daily need. Un
less he, Hassan, would land and travel
to an inland town called Nicosia, Where
his court lay, and there do homage to
him. This, scenting a trap, he feared
to do, nor could they put out to sea
without provisions.
"Cannot Sir Hugh Lozelle see to It?**
asked Rosamund.
"Doubtless, if he will," answered
Hassan, grinding his teeth; "but he
swears that he is powerless."
So there they bode day after day.
baked- by the sweltering summer tun
and rocked to and fro on the long
ocean rollers till their "hearts grew sick
within them, and their bodies also, for
some of them were seized with a fever
common to the shores of Cyprus, of
which two died. Now and again some
officer would come off from the shore
with Lozelle "and a little food and wa
ter and bargain with them, raying that
before their wants were supplied the
Prince Hassan must visit the Emperor
and bring with him the fair lady who
was his passenger, whom he desired to
see.
Hassan' would answer no, and double
the guard about Rosamund, for at
nights boats appeared that cruised
round them. In the daytime also bands
of mcii, fantastically dressed in silks,
and with them women, could be seen
riding to and fro upon the shore and
staring at them, as though they were
striving to make up their minds to at
tack the ship.
Then Hassan armed his grim Sara
cens and bade them stand in line upon
the bulwarks, drawn scimitar in hand,
a sight that seemed to frighten the
Cypriotesâat least they always rode
away toward the great square of Co
lossi. â¢
At length Hassan would bear It no
more. One morning Lozelle came off
from Limazol, where he slept at night,
bringing with him three Cyprian lords
who visited the shipânot to bargain as
they pretended, but to obtain 'sight of
the beauteous Princess Rosamund.
Thereon the common talk began or
homage that must be paid before food
was granted, failing which the Em
peror woulld bid his seamen capture
the ship. Hassan listened a while,
then suddenly issued an order that the
lords should be seized.
"Now," he said to Lozelle, "bid your
sailors haul up the anchor and let us
begone for Syria."
"But," answered the knight, "we
have neither food nor water for more
than one day."
"I care not," answered Hassan, 4, as
well die of thirst and starvation on the
sea as rot here with fever. What we
can bear these Cyprian gallants can
bear also. Bid the sailors lift the an
chor and hoist the sail, or I loose my
scimitars among them."
Now Lozelle stamped and foamed,
but without avail, so he turned to the
three lords, who were pale with fear,
and said:
"Which will you do: And food and
water for this ship, or put to sea with
out them, which is but to die?"'
They answered that they would go
ashore and supply all that was need
ful.
"Nay," said Hassan, "you bid* here
until it comes."
In the end, then, this happened, for
one of the lords chanced to be a
nephew of the Emperor, who, when he
learned that he was a captive, sent
supplies in plenty. Thus it came about
that the Cyprian lords having; been
sent back with the last empty boat,
within two days they were at sea
again.
Now Rosamund missed the hated
face of the spy. Nicholas, and told Has
san, who made inquiry to findâor so
said Lozelleâthat he went ashore and
vanished there on the first day of their
landing in Cyprus, though whether he
had been killed in some brawl, or fallen
sick, or hidden himself away, ha did
not know. Hassan shrugged his shoul
ders, and Rosamund was glad enough
to be rid of him, but in her heart she
wondered for what evil purpose Nicho
las had left the ship.
Ehen the galley was one day out
Â» Cyprus steering for the coast of
Syria, they fell into a calm such as is
common in those seas in summer. This
calm lasted eight whole days, during
which they made but little progress.
At length, when all were weary of
staring at the oil-like sea, a wind
sprang up that grew gradually to a
gale blowing toward Syria, and before
it they fled along swiftly. Worse and
stronger grew that gale, till on the
evening of the second day, when they
seemed in no little danger of being
pc-oped, they saw a great mountain far
away, at the sight of which Lozelle
thanked God aloud.
"Are those the mountains near Anti
och?" asked Hassan.
"Nay," he answered, "they are more
than fifty miles south of them, between
Ladikiya and Jebela. There, by the
mercy of heaven, is a good haven, for
I have visited it. where we can lie till
this storm is past."
"But we are steering for Darbesak.
not for a haven nÂ«ar Jebela, which is
a Frankish port," answered Hassan,
angrily.
"Then put the ship about and Â«teer
there yourself," said Lozelle, "and I
promise you this, that within two hours
every one of you will be dead at the
bottom of the sea."
Hassan considered. It was true, for
then the waves would strike them
broadside on, and they must fill and
sink.
"On your head be it," he answered
shortly.
The dark fell, and by the light of the
great lantern at their prow they saw
the white seas hiss past as they drove
shoreward beneath bare masts. For
they dared hoist no sail.
All that night they pitched and rolled,
till the stoutest of them fell sick, pray
ing God and Allah that they might
have light by which to enter the har*bor. At length they saw the top of th
loftiest mountain stow luminous wit
the coming dawn, although.the land It
self was still lost in shadow, and saw
also that It seemed to be towering al
most over them. '
"Take courage," cried Lozelle. "I
think that we are saved," and he hoist
ed a second lantern at his masthead
why, they did not know.
After this the sea began to fall, only
to grow rough again for a while as they
crossed some bar, to find themselves in
â¢ calm water, and on either side of them
what appeared in the dim. uncertain
light, to be the bush-clad banks of a
river. For a \Vhile they ran on, til
Lozelle called In a loud voice to the
sailors to let the anchor go, and sen
a ta say that all might rest
now, as they were safe. So they laid
them down tried to sleep.
But Kosftmand could not sleep. Pres
ently sb/j arose, and throwing on her
. clonk Vent to the door of the cabin
i<<ckej at the beauty of the moun
tains. ioÂ«y with the new-born light
and at the misty surface of the har
l>'Â»r. It was a lonely placeâat least
she could see no town or house, al
though tt.ey were lying not fifty yards
from the tree-hidden shore. As rhe
stood thus, she heard the sound of
boats being rowed through the mst
aid looking down, perceived also thai
Loxelle, who stood alone upon the deck
was watching their approach. Now
the ilrst boat made fast and a man
in the prow roso up and began to
â¢<peak to lozelle iv a low vÂ«>icÂ»
he did so the hood fell back from his
head, and Rosamund saw the face. It
was that of the spy Nicholas! For a
moment she stood amazed, for they
had left this man in Cyprus; then un
derstanding came to her and she cried
aloud:
"Treachery! Prince Hassan, there Is
. treachery."
As the words, left her lips fierce,
wild-looking men began Â«â¢ to scramble
aboard at the low waist of the galley,
to which boat after boat made fast.
The Saracens also tumbled from the
benches where they slept and ran aft
to the deck where Rosamund was, all
â¢except one of them, who was cut iff
In the prow of the ship. Prince Has
san appeared, too, scimitar in hand,
clad in his jeweled turban and coat of
mail, but without his cloak, shouting
orders as he came, while the hired crew
of the ship flung themselves upon their
knees and begged for mercy. To him
Rosamund cried out that they were
betrayed and by Nicholas, whom she
had seen. Then a great man, wearing
a white burnous and holding a naked
sword in his hand, stepped forward and
said in Arabic:
"Yield you now, for you are outnum
bered and your captain is captured,"
and he pointed to Lozelle. who was be
ing held by two men while his arms
were boun 1 behind him.
"In whose name do you bid me
yield?" asked the Prince, glaring
about him like a lion in a trap.
"In the dread name of Sinan, in the
name of the lord Al-Jebal, O servant
of Salah-. d-din."
At these words a groan of fear went
up even from the brave Saracens, for
now they learned that they had to do
with the terrible chief of the assassins.
"is there then war bttween the Sul
tan and Sinan V* asked Hassan.
"Aye, there is always war. Moreover,
who have one with you," and he pc-inted
to Rosamund, "who is dear to Salah
ed-din, whom, therefore, my master de
sires as a hostage."
"How know you that?" asked Harsan,
to pnln time while his men formed up.
"How does the lord Sinan know all
things?" was the answer. "Come, yielo.
and pelhans h- will allow you mercy."
"Through spies," hissed Hassan,
"audi spies as Nicholos. who has come
from Cyprus before us, and that Frank
ish dog who is called a knight," and he
pointed to Lozelle. "Nay, we yield nov,
..i.< here, Assassins, you have to do not
with poisons and the knife, but with
bare swords and brave men. Aye, and
1 warn youâand your lord âthat Salah
ed-din will take vengeance for this
deed."
"Let him try it if he wishes to die,
who hitherto has been spared," an
swered the tall man quietly. Then he
said to his followers, "Cut them down,
all save the women" âfor the French
woman, Marie, was now clinging to the
arm of Rosamund â"and Emir Hassan,
whom I am commanded to bring living
to Masyaf." ,
"Back to your cabin, lady," said
Hassan, "and remember that whate'er
befalls, we have done our best to save
you. Aye, and tell it to my lord, that
my honor may be clean in his eyes.
Now, soldiers of Salah-ed-din. fight and
die as he has taught you how. The
gates of paradise stand open, and no
coward will enter there."
They answered with a fierce guttural
cry. Then, as Rosamund fled to the
cabin, the fray began, a hideous fray.
On came the Assassins with sword and
dagger, striving to storm the deck.
Again and again they were beaten
back, till the waist seemed full of their
corpses, as man by man they fell be
neath the curved scimitars, and again
and again they charged these men
who, when their master ordered, knew
â¢ neither fear nor pity. But more boat
loads came from the shore, and the
Saracens were but few, worn also with
storm and sickness, so at last Rosa
mund peeping beneath her hand, saw
that the poop was gained.
Here and there a man fought on
until he fell beneath the cruel knives
in the midst of the circle of the dead,
among them the warrior Prince Has
san. Watching him with fascinated
eyes as he strove alone against a host,
Rosamund was put in mind of another
scene, when her father, alone also, had
striven thus against that emir and his
soldiers, and even then she bethought
her of the "justice of God. See! his
foot slipped on the blood-stained deck.
He was down, and ere he" could rise
again they had thrown cloaks over
him, these fierce, silent men, who even
with their lives at stake, remembered
the command of their captain, to take
him living. So living they took him,
with net a wound upon his skin, who
when he struck them down, had never
struck back at him lest the command
of Sinan should be broken.
Rosamund noted it, and remembering
that his command was also that she
should be brought to him unharmed,
knew that she had no violence to fear
at the hands of these cruel murderers.
From this thought, and because Has
san still lived, she took such comfort
as she might.
"It is finished," said the tall man, in
his cold voice. "Cast these dogs into
the sea who have dared to disobey the
command of Al-Jebal."
So they took them up, dead and liv
ing together, and threw them into the
water, where they sank, nor did one of
the wounded Saracens pray them for
mercy. Then they served their own
dead likewise, but those tliat were only {
wounded they took ashore. This done, 1
the tall man advanced to the cabin and
said:
"Lady, come, we are ready to start
upon our Journey."
Having no choice, Rosamund obeyed
him, remembering as she went how
from a scene of battle and bloodshed
she had been brought aboard that ship
to be carried she* knew not whither,
which now she left in a scene of battle
and bloodshed to be carried she knew
not whither.
"Oh!" she cried aloud, pointing to the
corpses they hurled into the deep, "ill
has it gone with these who stole me,
and ill" may it go with you also, serv
ant of Al-Jebal."
But the tall man answered nothing,
and followed by the weeping Marie and
the Prince Hassan, he led her to the
boat.
Soon they reached the shore, and
here they tore Marie from her. nor did
Rosamund ever learn what became of
her." or whether er no she found her
husband whom she had dared so much
to seek.
CHAPTER XL
The City of Al-Jebal.
Trouble not." said Godwin, "it is but
a scratch from the beast's claws. I am
ashamed that you should put your hair
to such vile uses. Give me a little
water, I pray you."
Masouda arose without a word and
retched him water, in which she min
gled wine. He drank of it and his
raintness left him, so that he was able
to stand up and move his arms and
legs.
"Why," he said, "it is nothing; I was
only shaken. That lioness did not hurt
me at. all."
L , ut you hurt the lioness," said Wulf,
with a laugh. "By St. Chad! a good
thrust," and he pointed to the long
sword driven up to the hilt through the
brute's breast. "Why, I swear. I could
not have made a better myself."
"I think it was the lion that thrust."
answered Godwin. "I only held the
sword straight. Drag it out, brother,
I am still too weak."
So Wuif set his foot upon the breast
of the lion and tugged and tugged until
at length he loosened the sword, say
ing as he strained at it:
' Oh! what an Essex hog am I, who
slept through It all, never waking until
Masouda seized me by the hair, and I
opened my eyes to see you upon/the
ground with this yellow beast croudhed
on the top of you like a hen on a nest
egg. I thought that it was alive and
smote It with my sword, which, had I
been fully awake. I doubt if I should
have the courage to do. Look," and
he pushed the lioness' head with his
foot, whereon it twisted round in such
a fashion that they perceived for th*
first time that it only hung to the
shoulders by a thread of skin.
"I am glad you did not smite a lit
tle harder," said Godwin, "or I should
now be in two pieces and drowned in
my own blood, instead of that of this
dead brute," and he looked ruefully at
his burnous and hauberk, which were
soaked with gore.
n," V K S ;" WUIf ' " r neVer thOUght
or that. Who would in such a hur

Lady Masouda," said Godwin;
when last I saw you you were hang
{"â¢rt^" 1 thCSC JaWa " Say> are you
"Nay." she answered, "for I wear
mail like you, and the teeth glanced
on it so that she held me by the cloak
only. Come, let us skin the beast, and
take its pelt as a present to the lord
Al-Jebal."
"Good," said Godwin, "and I give
you the claws for a necklace."
"I will weir them," s he ans.vered, a nd
helped Wulf flay the lioness while God
win sat by resting. When it was done
V> ulf went to the little cave and walked
into it, to come out again with a bound.
"Why:" he said, ' there are more of
them in there. I saw their eyes and
heard them snarl. Now give me a
burning branch and I will show you,
brother, that you are not the only one
who can fight a lion."
"Let be, you foolish man." broke in
Masouda. "Doubtless those are her
cubs, and if you siay them, her mate
will follow us for miles; but if they
are left safe he will stay to feed them.
Come, let us begone from this place as
swiftly as we can."
So having shown them the skin of the
lion, that they might know it was but
a dead thing, at the sight of which
they snorted and trembled, they
packed it upon one of the mules and
rod- off slowly into a valley some five
miles away, where was water but no
trees. Here, since Godwin needed rest,
they stopped all that day and night
which followed, seeing no more of lions,
though they watched for them sharply
enough. The next morning, having"
slept well, he was himself again, and
they started forward throusrh a broken
country toward a deep cleft, on either
side of which stood a tall mountain.
"This is Al-Jebal's gateway," said
Masouda, "and to-night -we should
sleep in the gate, whence one day's
ride brings us to his city."
Soon they rode till at length, perched
upon the sides of the cleft, they saw
a 'castle, a great building with high
walls, to which they came at sunset.
It seemed that they were expected in
this place, for men hastened to meet
them, who greeted Masc-uda and eyed
the brethren curiously, especially after
they had heard of the adventure with
the lion. These took them, not into the
castle, but to a kind of hostelry at its
back, where they were furnished with
food and slept the night.
Next morning they went on again to
a hilly country with beautiful and fer
tile valleys. Through this they rode
for two hours, passing on their way
several villages, where somber-eyed
people were laboring in the fields. From
each village, as they drew near to it,
horsemen would gallop out and chal
lenge them, whereon Masouda rode for
ward and spoke with the leader alone.
Then he would touch his forehead with
his hand and bow his head and they
rode on unmolested.
"See," she said, when they had been
stopped for the fourth time, "what
chance you had of winning through to
Masyaf alone. Why, I tell you, breth
ren, that you would have been dead
before ever you passed the gates of
the first castle."
Now they rode up a long slope, and
at its crest paused to look upon a mar
velous scene. Below them stretched a
vast plain, full of villages, cornfields,
olive groves, and vineyards. In the cen
ter of this plain, some fifteen miles
away, rose a great mountain, which
seemed to be walled all about. Within
the wall was a city of which the white,
flat-roofed houses climbed the slopes of
the mountain, and on its crest a flat
space of land covered with*trees and
a great, many-towered castle surround
ed by more nouses.
"Behold the home of Al-Jebal, lord
of the mountain," said Masouda,
"where we must sleep to-night. Now,
brethren, listen to me. Few strangers
who enter that castle come thence liv
ing. There Is still time; I can pass you
back as I passed you thither. Will you
go on?"
"We will go on," they answered with
one breath.
"Why? What have you to gain?
You seek a certain maiden. Why seek
her here whom you say has been taken
by Salah-ed-din? Because the Al-Je
bal of bygone days swore to befriend
Dne of your blood. But that Al-Jebal
Is dead, and another of his line rules
who took no such oath. How do you
know that he wjll befriend youâhow
that he will not enslave or kill you? I
have power in this land, why or how
does not matter, and I can protect you
igalnst all that dwell in itâas I swear
[ will, for did not one of you save my
life?" and she glanced at Godwinâ"ex
:ept mv lord Sinan, against whom I
aave no power, for I am his slave."
"He is the enemy of Salah-ed-din,
md may help us for his hate's sake."
"Yes, he is the enemy of Salah-ed
din now more than ever. He may help
you or he may not. Also," she added
with meaning, "you may not wish the
help he offers. Oh!" and there was a
note of entreaty in her voice, "think,
think! For the last time, I pray you
think!"
"We have thought," answered God
win, solemnly, "and, whatever chances,
we will obey the command of the dead."
She heard, and bowed her head in as
sent, then said, looking up again:
"So be it. You are not easily turned
from your purpose, and I like that
spirit well. But hear my counsel.
While you are In this city speak no
Arabic and pretend to understand
none. Also drink nothing but water,
which is good here, for the lord Sinan
sets strange wines before his guests,
that, if they pass the hps, produce vl-
slons and a kind of waking madness in
which you might do deeds whereof you
were afterward ashamed. Or you
might swear oaths that would ait
heavy on your souls, and yet could not
be broken except at the cost of life."
"Fear not," answered Wulf. "Water
shall be our drink, who have had
enough of drugged wines." for he re
membered the Christmas feast in the
hall at Steeple*
"You, Sir Godwin,** went on Ma
souda, "have about your neck a certain
ring which you were mad enough to
show to me a strangerâa ring with
writing on it that none can read save
the great men that in this land aro
called the dais. Well, as it chances,
the secret is safe with me; but be wise
and say nothing of that ring, and let
no eye see it."
"Why not." asked Godwin. "It Is the
token of our dead uncle to the Al-
Jebal."
She looked round her cautiously and
replied:
"Because It is, or once was. the great
signet, and a day may come when it
will save your lives. Doubtless when
the lord who Is dead thought it gone
forever he caused another to be fash
ioned, so like that I who have had it in
my hand could not tell the two apart. ,
To him who holds that ring air gates
are onen; but to let it be known that
you have its double means death. Do
you understand?"
They nodded, and she continued:
"Lastlyâthough you may think that
this seems much to ask âtrust me al
ways, even if I seem to play you false,
who for your sakes," and she sighed,
"have broken oaths and spoken words
for which the punishment la to die by
torment. Nay, thank me not, for I do
only what I must who am a slaveâa
slave."
"A slave to whom?" asked Godwin,
staring at her.
"To the Lord of All the Mountains,"
she answered with a smile that was
sweet yet very sad to see; and without
another word spurred on her horse.
"What does she mean," asked God
win of Wulf, when she was out of
hearing, "seeing that if Masouda speak
truth, for our sakes, in warning us
against him, she is breaking her fealty
to this lord?"
"I do not know, brother, and I do
not seek to know. All her talk may be
a part of a plot to blind us, or it may
not. Let well alone and trust in for
tune, say I."
"A good rede," answered Godwnl.
and they rode forward in silence.
They crossed the nlain. and toward
/
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALU
evening came to the wall of the outer
city, halting In front of the great gate
way. Here, as at the first castle, a band
of solemn-looking mounted men came
out to meet them, and, having
spoken a few words with Masouda. led
them over the drawbridge that spanned
the first rock-cut moat, and through
triple gates of iron into the city. Then
they passed' up a street very steep and
narrow, from the roofs and windows of
the houses on either side of which hun
dreds of people-many of them seemed
to be engaged at their evening prayer

gulf.
"Ride on and have
no fear,", said Ma
souda, "Your horses are
trained to heights, and
the mules and mine will
.ollow."
So Godwin, showing noth
ing in his face of the doubt
t hat he felt in his heart,
patted Flame upon the neck,
nd, after hanging back a little, the
norse started, lifting its hoofs high
and glancing from side to side at
the terrible gulf beneath. Where
Flame went Smoke knew that it
could go, and came on bravely, but
snorting a little, while the mules,
that did not fear heights so long as
the ground was firm beneath their
feet, followed. Only Masouda's horse
was' terrified, backed, and -strove to
wheel round, till she drove the spur
into it, when of a sudden it started and
came over at a gallop.
At length they were across, and pass
ing under another gateway which had
broad terraces on either side of it, rode
up a long street and entered the great
court yard, around which stood the
castle, a vast and frowning fortress.
Here a white-robed officer came for
ward, greeting them with a low bow,
and with him servants who assisted
them to dismount. These men took the
horses to a great range of stables on
one side of the courtyard, whither the
brethren followed to see the beasts
groomed and fed. Then the officer, who
had stood patiently by the while, con
ducted them through doorways and
down passages to the guest chambers,
large vaulted rooms, where they found
their baggage ready for them. Here
Masouda said that she would see them
again on the following morning, and
departed in company with the officer.
Wulf looked round the great vaulted
chamber, which, now that the dark had
fallen, was lit by flickering lamps set
in iron brackets round â¢. the wall, and
said:
"Well, for my part, I had rather pass
the night in the desert among the lions
than in this dismal place."
t Scarcely were the words out of his
lips when curtains swung aside and
beautiful women entered, clad in gauzy
veils and bearing dishes of food. These
they placed upon the ground before
them, inviting them to eat with nods
and smiles, while others appeared car
rying basins of scented water, which
they poured over their hands. Then
they sat down and ate the food that
was strange to them, but very pleas
ant to the taste; and while they ate.
women whom they could not see sang
sweet songs, and played upon harps
and lutes. Wine was offered to them
also; but of this, remembering Ma
souda's words, they would not drink,
asking by signs for water, which was
brought after a little pause. When
their meal was done, the beautiful
women bore away the dishes, and black
slaves appeared. These men led them
to baths such as they had never seen,
where they washed first In hot water,
then In cold. Afterward they were
rubbed with spicy-smelling oila, and
having been wrapped in white robes,
were brought back to their chamber,
where they found beds spread for them.
On these, being very weary, they lay
down, when a strange, sweet music
broke out afresh, and to the sound of it
they fell asleep.
When they awoke it was to ace the
light streaming through the high, lat
ticed windows.
"Did you sleep. Godwin," asked Wulf.
"Well enough," answered his brother,
"only I dreamed that throughout the
night folk came and looked at me."
"I dreamed that also," said Wulf,
"moreover, I think that it was not all
a dream, since there is a coverlet on
my bed which was not there when I
went to sleep."
Godwin looked at his own, where also
was another coverlet added, doubtless
as the night
grew colder in
that high place.
"I have heard of
enchanted castles,"
he said; "now I think
we have found one."
"Aye," replied Wulf,
"and It is well enongh
while it lasts."
They rose and dressed them
selves, putting on clean gar
ments and their best cloaks that
they had brought with them on the
mules, after which the veiled women
entered the room with breakfast.

At length one of the women said:

"Masouda was ever cruel," answered
the other, "who hates all men, which
Is unnatural. Yet I think if she loved
a man she would love him well, and
perhaps that might be worse for him
than her hate." â¢
"Are these knights spies?" asked the
first.

âholy city."
The women who were cleaning the
nail bowed also, for it seemed that
lere Masouda was a person of import
tnce. She took the hauberks from their
lands.
"11l cleansed," she said sharply. "I
hink that you girls talk better than
,*ou work. Nay, they must serve. Help
hese lords to don them. Fools, that is
he shirt of the gray-eyed knight. Give
t me; I will be his squire." and she
snatched the hauberk, from his hands,
â whereat, when her back was turned,
they glanced at one another.
"Now," she said, when they were ful
ly armed and had donned their mantles,
"you brethren look as pilgrims should.
Listen, I have a message for you. The
master"âand she bowed her head, as
did the women, guessing of whom she
spokeâ"will receive you in an hour's
time; till then, if it please you, we
can walk in the gardens, which are>
worth your seeing."
So they went out with her, and as
they passed toward the curtain she
whispered:
"For your life's sake, remember all
that I have told youâabout every
thing, about the wine and the ring, for
if you dream the drink-dream you will
be searched. Speak no word to me
save of common matters."
In the passage beyond the curtain
white-robed guards were standing,
armed with spears, who turned and
followed them without a word. First
they went to the stables to visit the
horses Flame and Smoke,* which whin
nied as they drew near. These were
found to be well-fed and tended; indeed,
a company of the grooms were gath
ered about them, discussing their
points and beauty, who saluted as the
owners of such steeds approached.
Leaving the stable, they passed
through an archway into the famous
gardens, whK:h were said to be the
most beautiful in all the East Beau
tiful they were, indeed, for here grew
shrubs and flowers such as had
never been seen, while between fern
clad rocks flowed sparkling rills which
fell over deep cliffs in waterfalls of
foam In places the shade of cedars
lay so dense that the light of day was
changed to twilight, but in others the
ground was open and carpeted with
flowers which filled the air with heavy
perfume. Everywhere grew roses,
myrtles and trees laden with rich
fruits, while from all sides came the
sound of cooing doves and the voices
of the bright-winged birds which
flashed from palm to palm.
On they walked down the sand
strewn paths for a mile or more, ac
companied by Masouda and the guard.
At length, passing through a brake of
whispering, reed-like plants, of a sud
den they came to a low wall, and saw
yawning black and white at their very
feet that vast cleft which they had
crossed before they entered the castle.
"It encircles the inner city, the fort
ress and its grounds," said Masouda;
"and who lives to-day that coula_
throw a bridge across it? Now, come"
back."
So, following the gulf round, they
returned to the castle by another path,
and were ushered into an anteroom,
where stood a watch of twelve men.
Here Masouda left them in the midst
of the men, who stared at them with
stony eyes. Presently she returned
and beckoned them to follow her.
Walking down a long passage they
came to curtains, in front of which
stood two sentries, who drew these
curtains as they approached. Then,
side by side, they entered a great hall,
long as Stangate Abbey Church, anc
passed through a number of people, all
crouched upon the ground. Beyond
them the hall narrowed as a chancel
does.
Here sat and stood more people,
fierce-eyed, turbaned men, who wore
great kr.ives in their" girdles. These,
as they learned afterward, were called
the fecial, the sworn assassins, who
lived but to do the command of their
lord the great At the end
of this chancel were more curtains, be
yond which was a guarded door. It
opened, and on its further side they
found themselves in full sunlight on
an ur.walled terrace., surrounded by
the mighty gulf into which it was
built out. On the right and left edges
of this terrace cat old and bearded
men, twelve in number, their heads
bowed humbly and their eyes fixed
upon the ground, who were the dais or
councilors.
At the head of the terrace, under an
open and beautifully carved pavilion
of wood, stood gigantic soldiers, having
the red dagger blazoned on their white
robes. Between them was a black
cushion, and on the cushion a black
heap. At first, staring out of the sun
light at this heap in the shadow, the
brethren wondered what it might be.
Then they caught sight of the glitter
of eyes, and knew that the heap was a
man who wore a black turban on his
head and a black, bell-shaped robe
clasped about his throat with a red
Jewel. The weight of the man had
sunk him down deep into the soft cush
ion, so that there was nothing of him
to be seen save the folds of the bell
shaped cloak, the red jewel and the
head. He looked like a coiled-up snake;
the dark and glittering eyes also were
those of a snake. Of his features. In
the deep shade of the canopy and of
the wide black turban, they could see
nothing.
, The aspect of this figure was so ter
. rible and inhuman that the brethren
trembled at the sight of him. They
1 were men and he was a man, but be
[ tween that huddled beady-eyed heap
and those two tall Western warriors.
, clad in their gleaming mail and colored
cloaks, helm on brow, buckler on arm
and long sword at side; the contrast
was that of life and death.
CHAPTER XII.
The Lord of Death.
Masouda ran forward and prostrated
herself at full length, but Godwin and
Wulf stared at the heap, and the heap
stared at them. Then, after some mo
tion of his chin, Masouda rose and
said:
"Strangers, you stand In the presence
of the Master, Sinan, Lord of Death.
Kneel, and do homage to the Master."
But the brethren stiffened their backs
and would not kneel. They lifted their
hands to their brows in salute and no
more.
Then from between the black turban
and the black cloak came a hollow
voice, speaking in Arabic, and saying:
"Are these the men who brought me
the lion's skin? Well, what seek ye,
Franks?"
They stood silent.
"Dread lord." said Masouda, "these
knights are but now come from Eng
land ovef sea, and do not understand
our tongue."
"Set out their story and their re
quest," said Al-Jebal, "that we may
Judge of them."
"Dread lord," answered Masouda, "as
I sent you word, they say they are the
kin of a certain knight who in battle
saved the life of him who ruled before
you, but is now an inhabitant of para
dise."
"I have heard that there was such a
knight," said the voice. "He was named
d'Arcy, and he bore the same cogniz
ance on his shield âthe sign of the
skull."
"Lord, these brethren are also named
d'Arcy, and now they some to ask your
help against Salah-ed-din."
At that name the heap stirred as a
snake stirs when it hears danger, and
the head erected itself a little beneath
the great turban.
"What help and why?" asked the
voice.
"Lord, Salah-ed-din has stolen a
woman of their house who is his niece,
and these knights, her brothers, ask
you *o aid them to recover her."
The beady eyes instantly became In
terested.
"Keport has been made to me of that
story," said the voice; "but what sign
do these Franks show? He who went
before me gave a ring, and with it cer
tain rights in this land, to the knight
d'Arcy who befriended him in danger.
Where is that ring, with which he part
ed in his foolishness?"
Masouda translated, and seeing the
warning in her eyes and remembering
her words, the brethren shook their
heads, while Wulf answered:
"Our uncle, the knight Sir Andrew,
was cut down by the soldiers of Salah
ed-din, and before he died bade us seek
you out. What time had he to tell us
cf any ring:?"
The head sank upon the breast
"I hoped," said Sinan to Masouda,
"that they had the ring, and it was for
this reason, woman, that I allowed you
to lead these knights hither, after you
had reported of them and their quest to
me from Beirut. It is not well that
there should be two sacred signets in
the world, and he who went before me,
when he lay dying, charged me to re
cover his if that were possible. Let
them go back to their own land and
return to me with the ring, and I will
help them."
translated the last sentence
only, and again the brethren shook
their heads. This time it was Godwin
who spoke.
' Our land is far away, O lord, and
where shall we find this long-lost ring?
Let not our journey be in vain. Oh
mighty one, give us justice against
Salah-ed-din."
" A 1! my years have I sought justice
on balan-ed-din," answered Sinan. "and
yet he prevails against me. Go. Pranks
and bring me his head and we will talk
if ft m i
WhÂ«Â»n they heard this saying Wulf

Lord, answered the man. "I ac
quaint you that your will has been
done in the matter of the vessel." Then
he went on speaking in a low voice so
rapidly that the brethren could scarce
ly hear and much less understand him.
Sinan listened, then said:
"Let the fedai enter and make hie
own report, bringing with him his
prisoners."
Now one of the dais, he who sat near
est the canopy, rose and. pointing
toward the brethren, said, "Touching
these Franks, what is your will?"
The beady eyes, which seemed to
search their souls, fixed themselves up
on them and for a long while Sinan
considered. They trembled, knowing
that he was passing some Judgment
concerning them in his heart, and that
on his next words much might hang
even their lives. 8
"Let them stay here," he said at
them " haVe ques^on3 to

lord of death, seemed to be lost in
thougnt under the black shadow of
his canopy; the double line of dais
stared at nothingness across the pas
sageway: the giant guards stood srtlll
as statues; Masouda watched tho
brethren from beneath her long eye
lashes, while the brethren watched the
sharp edge of the shadow of the can
opy on the marble floor. They strove
to seem unconcerned, but their hearts
were beating fast within them who felt
that great things were about to hap
pen, though what these might be
they knew not.
So intense was the silence, so dread
ful seemed that inhuman, snake-liko
man, so strange his aged, passionless
councilors, and the place of council
surrounded by a diz--iy gulf, that fear
took hold of them like the fear of an
evil dream. Godwin wondered if Sinan
could see the ring upon his breast, and
what would happen to him if he did see
it; while Wulf longed to shout aloud,
to do something that would break this
deadly, sunlit quiet To them those
minutes seemed like hours; ii deed for
aught they knew, they might have
been hours.
At length there was a stir behind the
brethren, and at a word from M
da they separated, falling apart a i â¢
or two, and stood opposite t ' t e h
other and sideways to Sinan. ta .fl
ing thus, they saw the curtair dra /n.
Through them came four men, carrying
a stretcher covered with a cloth be
neath which they could see the out
line of a form, that lay there stirless.
The four men brought the stretcher to
the front of the canopy,, set it on tho
gr<rnd, prostrated themselves, and re
tired, walking backward down the
length of the terrace.
Again there was silence, while the*
brethren wondered whose corpse it was
that lay beneath the cloth, for a corpse
it must surely be; though neither tho
lord of the mountain nor his dais and
guards seemed to concern themselves in
the matter. Again the curtains parted,
and a procession advanced up the ter
race. First came a great man clad
in a white robe blazoned with the bleed
ing dagger, after whom walked a tall
woman shrouded in a long veil, who
was followed by a thick-set knight clad
in Frankish armor and wearing a capo
of which the cowl covered his head as
though to keep the rays of tho sun
from beating on his helm. Lastly
walked four guards. Up the long place
they marched through the double lino
of dais, while with a strange stirring
in their breaths the brethren watched
the step and shape of the veiled wom
an who walked forward rapidly, not
seeing them, for she turned her head
neither to the right nor left The leader
of the little band retched the space
before the canopy, and, prostrating
himself by the side of the stretcher, lay
still. She who walked behind him
stopped also, and, seeing the black
heap upon the cushion, shuddered.
"Woman, unveil." commanded the
voice of Sinan.
She hesitated, then swiftly undid
some fastening, so that her drapery
fell from her head. The brethren
stared, rubbed their eyes, and stared
again.
Before them stood Rosamund!
Yes, it was Rosamund, worn with
sickness, terrors and travel, Rosamund
herself beyond all doubt. At the sight
of her pale, queenly beauty the heap
Dn the cushion stirred beneath his black
cloak, and the eyes were filled with an
evil, eager light. Even the dais seemed
to wake from their contemplation, and
Masouda bit her red lip, turned pale
beneath her olive skin, and watched
with devouring eyes, waiting to read
this woman's heart
"Rosamund!" cried the brethren with
one voice. â 
She heard. As they sprang toward
her she glanced wildly from face to
face, then with a low cry flung an arm
about the neck of each and would havo
fallen in the ecstasy of her Joy had
they not held her. Indeed, her knees
touched the ground. As they stooped
to lift her it flashed into Godwin's mind
that Masouda had told Sinan that they
were her brethren. The thought was
followed by another. If this were soÂ«
they might be left with her, whereas
otherwise that black robed devil
"Listen," he whispered in English;
"we are not your cousinsâwe are your
brothers, your half-brothers, and we
know no Arabic."
She heard and Wulf heard, but the
watchers thought that they were but
welcoming each other, for Wulf began
to talk also, random words in French,
such as "Greeting, sister!" "Well
found, sister!" and kissed her on the
forehead.
Rosamund opened her eyes, which
had closed, and, gaining her feet, gavo
one hand to each of the brethren. Then
the voice of Masouda was heard in
terpreting the words of Sinan.
"It seems, lady, that you know these
knights."
"I doâwell. They sre my brothers,
from whom I was stolen when they
were drugged and our father was
killed."
"How is that, lady, seeing that you
are said to be the niece of Salah-ed-nephews of Salah-sd-dln?"
"Nay," answered Rosamund, "they
are my father's sons of another wife."
The answer appeared to satisfy Sin
an, who fixed his eyes upon the pale
beauty of Rosamund and asked no
more questions. While he remained thus
thinking, a noise arose at the end of
the terrace, and the brethren, turning
their heads, saw that the thick-set
knight was striving to thrust his way
through the guards who stood by the
curtains and barred his path with the
shafts of their spears. Then it came
into Godwin's mind that Just before
Rosamund unveiled he had seen this
knight suddenly turn back and walk
down the terrace.
The lord Sinan looked up at the sound
and made a sign. Thereon two of the
dais sprang to their feet and ran to
ward the curtain, where they spoke
with the knight who turned and came
back with them, though slowly, as one
who is unwilling. Now his hood had
fallen from his head, and Godwin and
Wulf stared at him as hs advanced,
for surely they knew those great shoul
ders, thoss round, black eyes, those
thick hps, and that heavy jowl.
"Loselle! It is Lozelle 1" said God
win.
"Aye." echoed Rosamund, "It Is Lo
selle, the double traito* who betrayed
me first to the soldiers of Saladin, and,
because I would have none of his love,
next to this lord Sinan,"
Wulf heard, and, as Loosllo drew
near to them, sprang forward with aft
oath and struck him across the face
with his mailed hand. Instantly gaurds
thrust themselves between them, and
Sinan asked through Masouda:
'Why do you dare to strike this
Frank in my presence?"
"Because, lord," answered Wulf, "he
is a rogue who has brought all these
troubles on our house. I challenge him
to meet ms in battle to the death."
"And I also," said Godwin.
"I am ready," shouted Loselle, stung
to fury by blow.
"Then, dog, why did you try to run
away when you saw our faces?" asked
Wulf.
Masouda held up her hand and be
gan to interpret, addressing Lozelle.
and speaking in the first parson as the
"mouth" of Sinan.
"I thank you for your service who
have served me before. Your messen
ger came, a Frank whom I knew in
old days. As you had arranged It
should be, I sent one of my fedais with
soldiers to kill the men of Salah-ed-din
on the ship and capture this lady, who
Is his niece, all of which it saems has
been done. The bargain that your
messenger made was that the lady
should be given over to you "
Here Godwin and Wulf ground their
teeth and glared at him.
"But these knights say that you
stole her, their kinswoman, from them,
and one of them has struck you and
challenged you to single combat which
challenge you have accepted. I sanc
tion the combat gladly, who have long
desired to see two knights of the
Franks fight in tourney according to
their custom I will set the course,
and you shall be given the best horse
in my kingdom; this knight shall ride
his own. These are the conditions âthe
course shall be on the bridge between
the inner and outer gates of the castle
city, and the fight, which must be to
the death, shall take place on the
night of the full moon âthat Is, three
days from now. If you are the victor
we will talk of the matter of the lady
for whom you bargained as a wife."
"My lord, my lord," answered Lo
zelle, "who can lay a lance on that ter
rible place In moonlight? Is it thus
that you keep faith with me?"
"I can and will!" cried Wulf. "Dog,
I would fight you in the gates of hell,
with mv soul on the hazard."
"Keep faith with yourself," said
Sinan, "who said that you accepted
the challenge of this knight and made
no conditions, and when you have
proved upon his body that his quarrel
is not Just, then speak of my faith
with you. Nay, no more words; when
this fight is done we will speak again,
and not before. Let him be led to the
outer castle and there given of our
best. Let my great black horse be
brought to him that he may gallop it
to and fro upon the bridge, or where
he will within the circuit of the walls,
by day or night; but see that he has
no speech with this lady whom he has
betrayed Into my power, or with these
knights his foes, nor suffer him to
come into my presence. I will not talk
with a man who has been struck in the
face until he has washed away the
blow In blood."
As Masouda finished translating, and
before Lozelle could answer, the lord
Sinan moved his head; whereon guards
sprang forward and conducted Lozelle
from the terrace.
"Farewell. Sir Thief," cried Wulf
after him, "tin we meet again upon the
narrow.bridge and there settle our ac
count You have fought Godwin, per
haps you will have better luck with
Wulf."
Lozelle glared after him, and, find
ing no answer, went on his way.
"Your report" said Sinan, addressing
the tall fedai who all this while had
lain upon his face before him, still as
the form that was stretched upon the
bier. "There should have been another
prisoner, the great Emir Hassan. Also,
where Is the Frankish spy?"
The fedai rose and spoke.
"Lord," he said, "I did your bidding.
The knight who has gone steered the
ship into the bay as had been ar
ranged. I attacked with the daylight
The soldiers of Balah-ed-dln fought
bravely, for the lady hers saw us, and
gave them time to gather, and we lost
many men. We overcame and killed
them all, except the Prince Hassan,
whom we took prisoner. I left some
men to watch the ahlp. The crew we
spared, as they were the servants of
the Frank Loselle, setting them loose
upon the beach, together with a Frank
ish woman, who was the servant of
the lady here, to find their way to the
nearest city. This woman I would
have killed, but the lady your captive
begged for her life, saying she had
come from the hind of the Franks to
seek her husband) so, having no or
ders, I let her go. Yesterday morning
we started for Masyaf, the Prince Has
san riding in a litter together with
that Frankish spy who was here a
while ago, and told you of the coming
of the ship. At night they slept in the
same tent; I left the Prince bound and
set a guard, but in the morning when
we looked we found him goneâhoW, I
know not âand lying in the tent the
Frankish soy, dead, with a knife
wound through his heart. Behold!"
and withdrawing the cloth from the
stretcher he revealed the stiff form of
the spy Nicholas, who lay there dead,
a look of terror frozen on his face.
"At least this one has come to an
end he deserved," muttered Wulf to
Godwin.
"So, having searched without avail, I
came on here with the lady your pris
oner and the Frank Lozelle. I have
spoken."
Now, when he had heard this report,
forgetting- his cairn, Sinan arose from
the cushion and stepped forward two
paces. There he halted, with fury in
his glittering eyes, looking like a man
clothed in a black bell. For a moment
he stroked his long beard, and the
brethren noted that on the first finger
of his right hand was a ring so like to
that which hung about the neck of
Godwin that none could have told
them apart.
"Man," Sinan said in a low voles,
"what have you done? You have left
the Emir Hassan go, who is the most
trusted friend and general of the Sul
tan of Damascus. By now he is there,
or near it, and within six days we
shall see the army of Salah-ed-din rid
ing across the plain. Also you have
not killed tba crew and the Frankish
woman, and they, too. will make re
port of the taking of the ship and the
capture of this lady, who Is of the
house of Balah-ed-dln. and whom he
seeks more earnestly than all the king
dom of the Franks. What have you to
sayt"
"Lord," said tho tall fadai. and his
hand trembled as be snake, "most
mighty lord, X had no eiders as to the
killing of the orew from your lips, and
the Frank LosoUo told me that he had
agreed with you that they should be
spared,"
"Then, slavs, he lied, He agreed
with me through thai dead spy that
they should be slain, and do you not
know that If I giro no order* in such
a ease I mean death, not life? But
what of the Prince Hassan f
"Lord, I have nothing to say. X think
he must hare bribed the spy named
Nicholas"âand he pointed to the
corpseâ"to out his bonds, and after
ward killed the man for vengeanco
sake, for by the body we found a purse
of gold. That he hated them as he
hated yonder Loselle I know, for he
called them dogs and traitors in the
boat; and since he could not strike
them, his hands being bound, he spat
on thtlr faces, cursing them in the
name of Allah. That is why, Loselle
being afraid to be near him, I set the
spy Nicholas, who was a bold fellow,
as a watch over him, and two soldiers
outside the tent, whils Loselle and I
watched the lady."
"Let those soldiers be brought," said
Sinan, "and toll their story."
They were brought and stood by
their captain, but they had no story to
tell. They swore that they had not
slept on guard, nor heard a sound, yet
when morning came the Prince was
gone. Again the lord of death stroked
his black beard. Then he held up the
signet before the eyes of the three men,
saying:
"You see the token. Go!"
"Lord," said the fedai, "I have served
you well for many years."
"Your service Is ended. Go!" was
the stern answer.
Tho fedai bowed his head in salute,
stood for a moment as though lost In
thought, then, turning suddenly, walk
ed with a steady step to the edge of
the abyss and leaped. For an instant
the sunlight shone on his whits and
fluttering robe, then from the depths
of that darksome place floated up the
sound of a htavy fall, and all was still.
"Follow your captain to Paradise,'
said Sinan to the two soldiers, where
on one of them drew a knife to stab
himself, but a dai sprang up, saying:
"Beast, would you shed blood before
your lord? Do you not know the cus
tom? Begone!"
So the poor men went, the first with
a steady step, and the second, who was
not so brave, reeling over the edge of
the precipice as one might who is
drunken.
"It is finished," said the dais, clap
ping their hands gently. "Dread lord,
we thank thee for thy justice."
But Rosamund turned sick and faint,
and even the brethren paled. This
man were terrible indeedâif he were a
man and not a dcvil âand they were in
his power. How long would it be, they
wondered, before they also were bid
den to walk that gulf? Only Wulf
swore in his heart that if he went by
this road Sinan should go with him.
Then the corpse of the false palmer
was borne away to be thrown to the
eagles, which always hovered over that
house of death, and Sinan, having re
seated himself upon the cushion, be
gan to talk again through his "mouth"
Masouda, in a low, quiet voice, as
though nothing had happened to an
ger him
"Lady," he said to Rosamund, "your
story is known to me. Salah-ed-dio
seeks you, nor is it wonderful"âhere
his eyes glittered with a new and hor
rible lightâ"that he should desire to
see such loveliness at his court, al
though the Frank Lozelle swore
through yonder dead spy that you are
precious in his eyes because of some
vision that has come to him. Well,
this heretic Sultan is my enemy, whom
Satan protects, for even my fedals
have failed to kill him, and perhaps
there will be war on account of you.
But have no fear, for the price at
which you shall be delivered to him is
higher than Salah-ed-din himself would
care to pay, even for you. So, since
this castle is Impregnable, here you
may dwell In peace, nor shall any de
sire be denied you. Speak, and your
wishes are fulfilled."
"I desire," said Rosamund in a low,
steady voice, "protection against Sir
Hugh Loselle and all men."
"It is yours. The Lord of the Moun
tain covers you with his own mantle."
"I desire," she went on, "that my
brothers here may lodge with me, that
I may not feel alone among strange
people."
He thought awhile, and answered:
"Your brethren shall lodge near you
in the guest castle. Why not, 4 since
from them you cannot need protec
tion? They shall meet you at the. feast
and in the garden. But, lady, do you
know It? They came hers upon faith
of some old tale of a promise mads by
him who went before me to ask my
help to recover you from Salah-ed-din,
unwitting that I was your host, not
Salah-ed-din. That they should meet
you thus is a chance which makes
even my wisdom wonder, for in it I
see omens. Now she whom they wish
ed to rescue from Salah-ed-din, these
tall brethren of yours might wish to
rescue from Al-Jebal. Understand,
then, all of you, that from the Lord of
Death there Is but one escape. Yon
der runs its path," and he pointed to
the dizzy place whence his three ser
vants had leaped to their doom
"Knights," he went on, addressing
Godwin and Wulf, "lead your sister
hence. This evening I bid her, and
you, to my banquet Till then, fare
well. Woman," he added to Masouda,
"accompany them You know your
duties; this lady Is in your charge.
Suffer that no strange man comes near
herâabove all, the Frank Loselle.

claimedâTo these three is given the
protection of the signet In all things,
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
save that they. must not leave my
walls except under sanction of the sig
net ânay, in its very presence."
The dais rose, bowed and seated
themselves again. Then, guided by
Masouda and preceded and followed
by guards, the brethren and Rosa
mund walked down tho terrace
through the curtains into the chancel
like place where men crouched upon
the ground; through the ante-cham
ber where, at a word from Masouda,
the guards saluted; through passages
to that place where they had slept.
Here Masouda halted and said:
"Lady Rose of the World, who are
fitly so named, I go to prepare your
chamber. Doubtless you will wish to
speak with these yourâbrothers.
Speak on and fear not for it shall be
my care that you are left alone, if
only for a little while. Yet walls have
ears, so I counsel you use that Eng
lish tongue which none of us under
stand In the land of Al-Jebalânot
I."
Then she bowed and went
CHAPTER XIII.
Ilia Embassy.
The brethren and Rosamund looked
at each other, for having so much to
say it seemed that they oould not
speak. Then with a low cry Rosa
mund said:
"Oh, let us thank God, who, after
all those black months of travel and
of danger, has thus brought us to
gether again," and kneeling down
there together in the guest hall of the
lord of death, they gave thanks ear
nestly enough.
Then, moving to tho center of the
chamber where they thought that
none would hear them, they began to
speak In low voices and In English.
"Tall your tale first Rosamund,"
said Godwin.
She told It as shortly as she couM.
they listening without a word.
Then Godwin spoke and told her
theirs. Rosamund listened and asked
a question almost in a whisper.
"Why does that beautiful dark
eyed woman befriend you?"
"I do not know," answered Godwin,
"unless it is because of the accident
of my having saved her from the
lion."
Rosamund looked at, him and
smiled a little and Wulf smiled also.
Then she said:
"Blessings be on that lion and all
its trlbel I pray that she may not
soon forget the deed, for it seems that
our lives hang upon her favor. How
Strang* is this story and how desper
ate our case! How strange also that
you should have come on hither
against her counsel, which, seeing
what we have, I think was honest."
"We were led," answered Godwin.
"Your father had wisdom at his
death and saw what we could not
see."
"Aye," added Wulf. "but I would
that It had been in some other place,
for I fear this lord Al-Jebal at whose
nod men hurl themselves to death."
"He is hateful," answered Rosa
mund, with a shudder; "worse even
than the Knight Lozelle; andfwhen
he fixes his eyes on me my heart
grows sick. Ohl that we could escape
this place!"
"An eel In an osier trap has more
chance of freedom," said Wulf gloom
ily. "Let us at least be thankful that
we are caged togetherâ long,
I wonder."
As he spoke Masouda appeared, at
tended by waiting women and, bowing
to Rosamund, said:
"It is the will of the master, lady,
that I lead you to the chambers that
have been made ready for you, there
to rest until the hour of the feast.
Fear not; you shall meet your breth
ren then. You knights have leave, if
It so pleases you, to exercise your
horses in the garden. They stand
saddled in the courtyard, to which
this woman will bring you," and she
pointed to one of those two maids who
had cleaned the armor, "and with
them are guides and an escort."
"She means that we must go," mut
tered Godwin, adding aloud, "farewell,
sister, until to-night."
So they parted, unwillingly enough.
In the courtyard they found the horses,
Flame and Smoke, as they had been
told, also a mounted escort of four
fierce-looking fedals and an officer.
When they were in the saddle this
man, motioning to them to follow him,
passed by an archway out of the court
yard into the gardens. Hence ran a
broad road strewn with sand, along
which he began to gallop. This road
followed the gulf which encircled the
citadel and inner town of Masyaf, that
was, as it were, an island on a moun
tain top with a circumference of more
than three miles.
As they went, the gulf always on
their right, holding in their horses to
prevent their passing that of their
guide, swift,as.it was, they saw an
other troop approaching them. This
was also preceded by an officer of the
Assassins, as these servants of Al-
Jebal were called by the Franks, and
behind him, mounted on a splendid
coal-black steed and followed by
Euards, rode a mail-clad Frankish
night
"It. Is Lozelle," said Wulf, "upon the
horse that Sinan promised him."
At the sight of the man a fury took
hold of Godwin. With a shout of
warning he drew his sword. Lozelle
saw, and out leaped his blade in an
swer. Then sweeping past the officers
who were with them and reining up
their steeds, in a second they were face
to face. Lozelle struck first and God
win caught the stroke upon his buck
ler, but before he could return It the
fedals of either party rushed between
them and thrust them asunder.
"A pity," said Godwin, as they
dragged his horse away. "Had they left
us alone I think, brother, I might have
saved you a moonlight duel."
"That I do not want to miss, but the
chance at his head was good If those
fellows would have let you take it,"
answered Wulf reflectively.
Then the horses began to gallop
again, and they saw no more of Lo
zelle. Now, skirting the edge of the
town, they came to a narrow, wall
less bridge that spanned the gulf be
tween It and the outer gate and city.
Here the officer wheeled his horse, and,
beckoning to them to foilow, charged
it at full gallop. After him went the
brethrenâGodwin first, then Wulf. In
the deep gateway on the further side
they reined up. The captain turned,
and began to gallop back faster than
he had comeâas fast, indeed, as his
good beast would travel.
"Pass him!" cried Godwin, and shak
ing the reins loose upon the neck of
Flame called to It aloud.
Forward It sprang, with smoke at its
heels. Now they had overtaken the
captain, and now even on that narrow
way they had swept past him. Not an
Inch was there to spare between them
and the abyss, and the man, brave as
he was, expecting to be thrust to death,
clung to his horse's mane with terror
in his eyes. On the city side the
brethren pulled up laughing among the
astonished fedals who - had waited for
them there.
"By the Signet," cried the officer,
thinking that the khights could not un
derstand, "these are not men; they are
devils, and their horses are goats of
the mountains. I thought to frighten
them, but It's I who was frightened, for
they swept past me like eagles of the
air/*
"Gallant riders and swift, well
trained steeds," answered one of the
fedai with admiration In his voica "The
fight at the full moon will be worth our
seeing."
Then once more they took the sand
strewn road and galloped on. Thrice
they passed round the city thus, the
last time by themselves, for the captain
and the fedai were far outstripped. In
deed It was not until they had unsad
dled Flams and Smoke in their stalls
that theee appeared, spurring their
foaming horses. Taking no heed of
them, the brethren thrust aside the
groom, dressed their steeds down, fed
and watered them.
Then having them eat, there being
no more to do, they walked back to the
guest houss, hoping to find Rosamund.
But they found no Rosamund, so sat
down together and talked of the won
derful things that had befallen them,
and of what might befall them in the
future; of the mercy of Heaven also
which had brought them all three to
gether safe and sound, although it was
in this house of hell. So the time
passed on, till about the hour of sun
set the women servants came and led
them to the bath, where the black
slaves washed and perfumed them,
clothing them In fresh robes above their
armor.
When they came out the sun was
down, and the women, bearing torches
in their hands, conducted them to a
great and gorgeous hall which they had
not seen before, built of stone but with
a carved and painted roof. Along one
side of this hall, that was lit with
cressets, were a number of round
headed open arches supported by ele
gant columns, and beyond them a mar
ble terrace with flights of steps which
led to the gardens beneath. On the
floor of this hall, each seated upon his
cushion beside low tables Inlaid with
pearl sat the guests, a hundred or
more, all dressed in white robes on
which the red dagger was blazoned,
and all as silent as though they were
asleep.
When the brethren reached the place
the women left them, and servants with
gold chains round their necks escorted
them to a dais in the middle of the
hall where there were many cushions,
as yet unoccupied, arranged in a semi
circle, of which the center was a divan
higher and more gorgeous than the
rest.
Here places were pointed out to them
opposite the divan, and they took their
stand by them They had not long to
wait, for presently there was a sound
of music, and, Heralded by troops of
singing women, the lord Sinan ap-
Soached, walking slowly down the
igth' of the great hall. It was a
c trance procession, for after the wom
en came the aged, white robed dais,
then the lord Al-Jebal himself, clad now
In his blood-red, festal robe, and wear
ing Jewels on his turban.
Around him\ rngsched fipar slaves,
black as ebony, each of whom held a
flaming torch on high, while behind
followed the two gigantic guards who
had stood sentry over him when he sat
under the canopy of Justice. As he ad
vanced down the hall every man In
It rose and prostrated himself, and so
remained until their lord was seated,
save only the two brethren, who stood
erect like the survivors among the
slain of a battle. Settling himseif
among the cushions at one end of the
divan, he waved his hand, whereon the
feasters, and with them Godwin and
Wulf, sat themselves down.
Now there was a pause, while Sinan
glanced along the hall impatiently.
&oon the brethren saw why, since at
the end opposite to that by which he
had entered appeared more singing
women, and after them, also escorted
by four black torch-bearers, only these
were women, walked Rosamund, and,
behind her, Masouda.
Rosamund it was without doubt, but
Rosamund transformed, for now she
seemed an Eastern queen. Round her
head was a coronet of gems from which
hung a veil, but not so as to hide her
face. Jeweled, too, were her heavy
plaits of hair, Jeweled the rose-silk
garments that she wore, the girdle at
her waist, her naked, ivory arms and
even the slippers on her feet. As she
approached in her royal-looking beauty
all the guests at that strange feast
stared first at her and next at each
other. Then as though by a single im
pulse they rose and bowed.
"What can this mean?" muttered
Wulf to Godwin as they did likewise.
But Godwin made no answer.
On came Rosamund, and now, be
hold! the lord Al-Jebal rose also and,
giving her his hand, seatea" her by him
on the divan.
"Show no surprise, Wulf," muttered
Gcdwin, who had caught a warning
look in the eyes of Masouda as she took
up her position behind Rosamund.
Now the feast began. Slaves running
to and fro, set dish after dish filled
with strange and savory meats, upon
the little Inlaid tables, those that were
served to Sinan and his guests fash
ioned, all of them, of silver or of gold.
Godwin and Wulf ate, though not for
hunger's sake, but of what they ate
they remembered nothing who were
watching Sinan and straining their
ears to catch all he said without seem
ing to take note or listen. Although
she strove to hide it and to appear in
different, it was plain to them that
Rosamund was much arraid. Again
and again Sinan presented to her choice
morsels of food, sometimes on the
dishes and sometimes with his fingers,
and these she was obliged to take. All
the while also he devoured her with
his fierce eyes so that she shrank away
from him to the furthest limit of the
divan.
Then wine, perfumed and spiced,
was brought in golden cups, of Which,
having drunk, he offered to Rosa
mund. But she shook her head and
asked Masouda for water, saying that
she touched nothing stronger, and it
was given her, cooled with snow. The
brethren asked for* water also, where
on Sinan looked at them suspiciously
and demanded the reason. Godwin re
plied through Masouda that they "were
under oath to touch no wine till they
returned to their own country, having
fulfilled their mission. To this he an
swered meaningly that It was good
and right to keep oaths, but he feared
that theirs would make them water
drinkers for the rest of tneir lives, a
saying at which their hearts sank.
Now the wine that he had drunk
took hold of Sinan and he began to
talk, who without It was so silent.
"You met the Frank Lozelle to-day,
he said to Godwin, "when riding in
my gardens, and drew your sword on
him. "Why did you not kill him?
Is he the better man?"
"It seems not, as I sit here unhurt,
lord," answered Godwin. "Your ser
vants thrust between and separated
us."
"Aye," replied Sinan. "I remember;
they had orders. Still, I would that
you had killed him, the unbelieving
dog, who has dared to lift his eyes to
this Rose of Roses, your sister. Fear
not," he went on, addressing Rosa
mund, "he shall offer you no more In
sult, who are henceforth under the
protection of the signet," and stretch
ing out his thin, cruel-looking hand,
on which gleamed the ring of power,
he patted her on the arm.
All of these things Masouda trans
lated, while Rosamund dropped her
head to hide her face, though on it
were not the blushes that he thought,
but loathing and alarm.
Wulf glared at the Al-Jebal. whose
head by good fortune was turned
away, and so fierce was the rage
swelling in his heart that a mist
seemed to gather before his eyes, and
through It this devilish chief of a peo
ple of murderers, clothed 'hi his robe
of flaming red, looked like a man
steeped in blood. The thought came
to him suddenly that he would make
him what he looked and his hand
passed to his sword hilt. But Godwin
saw the terror in Masouda'a eyes, saw
Wulf's hand also and guessed what
was about to chance. With a swift
movement of his arm he struck a
golden dish from the table to the
marble floor, then said in a clear voice
in French:
"Brother, be not so awkward; pick
up that dish and answer the lord Si
nan as is your rightâl mean touching
the matter of Lozelle."
Wulf stooped to obey end his mind
cleared which had been so near to
madnesa
"I wish It not. lord," he said,
"who, If I can, have your good leave
to slay this fellow on the third night
from now. If I fall, then let my
brother take my place, but not be
fore."
"Yes, I forgot, said Sinan. "So I
decreed, and that will be a fight I
wish to see. If he kills you, then your
brother shall meet him. And If he
kills you both, then, perhaps I, Sinan,
will meet himâin my own fashion.
Sweet lady, knowing where the course
is laid, say, do you fear to see this
fray?"
Rosamund's face paled, but she an
swered proudly:
"Why should I fear what my
brethren do not fear? They are brave
knights, bred to arms, and God, in
whose hand are all our destinies â
even youra O Lord of Death âhe will
guard the right."
When this speech was translated to
him Sinan quailed a little, then he an
swered:
"Lady, know that I am the voice
snd prophet of Allahâaye, and his
sword to punish evildoers and those
wrio do not believe. Well, if what I
hear is true, your brethren are skilled
horsemen, who even dared to pass my
servant on the narrow bridge, so vic
tory may rest with them. Tell me
which of them do you love best, for he
shall first face the sword of Lozelle."
Now as she prepared herself to an
swer Masouda scanned her face
through her half-closed eyes. But,
whatever she may have felt within, it
remained calm and cold as though it
were cut in stone.
"To me they are as one man," she
said. "When one speaks, both speak.
I love them equally."
"Then, guest of my heart, it shall
go as I have said. Brother Blue Eyes
shall fight first, and If he falls then
brother Gray Eyes. The feast is end
ed, and it is my hour for prayer.
Slaves, bid the people fill their cups.
Lady, I pray of you, stand forward on
the dais."
She obeyed, and at a sign the black
slave women gathered behind her with
their flaming torches. Then Sinan
rose also and cried with a loud voice:
"Servants of Al-Jebal, pledge, I com
mand you, this flower of flowers, the
high-born Princess of Baalfcec. the
niece of the Sultan, Salah-ed-din,
whom men call the Great," and he
sneered, "though he be not so great as
I; this queen of maids who soonâ"
And checking himself he drank off his
wine, then with a low bow presented
the empty Jeweled cup to Rosamund.
All the company drank also and
shouted till the hall rang, for her love
liness as she stood thus In the fierce
light of the torches, aflame as these
men were with the vision-breeding
wine of Al-Jebal, moved them to mad
ness.
"Queen! Queen!" they shouted.
"Queen of our master and of us all!"
Sfnan heard and smiled. Then, mo
tioning for silence, he took the hand of
Rosamund and kissed it, and turning
passed from the hall, preceded by his
singing women and surrounded by his
dais and guards.
Godwin and Wulf stepped forward to
speak with Rosamund, but Masouda
interposed herself between them, say
ing In a cold, clear voice:
"It is not permitted. Go, knights,
and cool your brows in yonder >garden,
where sweet water runs. Your sister is
in charge. Fear not, for she is guarded."
"Come," said Godwin to Wulf; "we
had best obey."
So together they walked through the
crowd of those feasters that remained,
for most of them had already left the
hall, who made way, not without rev
erence, for the brethren of this new
star of beauty on to the terrace and
from the terrace into the gardens. Here
they stood awhile In the sweet fresh
ness of the night, which was very
grateful after the heated, perfume
laden air of the banquet; then began
to wander up and down among the
scented and flowers. The moon,
floating'in a cloudless sky, was almost
at its full, and by her light they saw
a wondrous scene. Under many of the
trees and in tents set about here and
there rugs were spread, and to them
came men who had drunk of the wine
of the feast and cast themselves down
to sleep.
"Are they drunk?" asked Wulf.
"It would seem so," answ r ered God
win.
Yet these men appeared to be mad
rather than drunk, for they walked
steadily enough, but with wide-set,
dreamy eyes; nor did they seem to
sleep upon the rugs, but lay there star
ing at the sky and muttering with their
lips, their faces steeped in a strange,
unholy rapture. Sometimes they would
rise and walk a few paces with out
stretched arms, till the arms closed
as though they clasped something in
visible, to which they bent their heads
to babble awhile. Then they walked
back to their rugs again, where they
remained silent. \
As they lay thus, white-veiled
women appeared, who crouched by the
heads of these sleepers, murmuring into
their ears, and when from time to
time they sat up, gave them to drink
from cups they carried, after partak
ing of which they luy down again
and became quite senseless. Then the
women would move on to others and
serve them likewise. Some of them
approached the brethren with a slow,
gliding motion, and offered them the
cup; but they walked forward, taking
no notice, whereupon the girls left
them, laughing softly, and saying such
things as "To-morrow we shall meet,"
or "Soon you will be glad to drink
and enter into paradise."
"When the time comes doubtless we
shall be gladâwho have dwelt here,"
answered Godwin gravely, but as he
spoke in French they did not under
stand him
"Step out, brother," said Wulf, "for
at the very sight of those rugs I grow
sleepy, and the win* in tho cups spar
kles as bright as their bearers' eyes."
So they walked on toward the sound
of a waterfall, and. when they came
to it, drank, and bathed their faces and
heads.
"This is better than their wine," said
Wulf. Then, catching sight of more
women flitting round them, looking like
ghosts amid the moonlit glades, they
pressed forward till they reached an
open sward where there were no rugs,
no sleepers, and no cup-bearers.
"Now," said Wulf. halting, "tell me
what does all this mean?"
"Are you deaf and blind?" asked
Godwin. "Cannot you se* that yonder
fiend Is in love with Rosamund, and
means to take her, as he well may
do?"
Wulf groaned aloud, then answered:
"I swear that first I will send his
â oul to hell, even though our own must
keep it company."
"Aye," answered Godwin, "I saw;
you went near to it to-night But re
member, that is the end for all of us.
Let us wait then to strike until we I
mustâto save her from worse things."
"Who knows that we may find an
other chance? . Meanwhile, mean
whileâ" and again he groaned.
"Among those ornaments that hung
about the waist of Rosamund I saw a
Jeweled knife," answered Godwin, sad
ly. "She can be trusted to use It 11
need be, and after that we can be trust
ed to do our worst At least, I think
that we should die In a fashion that
should be remembered in this moun
tain."
As they spoke they had loitered to
ward the edge of the glade, and halting
there stood silent, till presently from
under the shadow of a cedar tree ap
peared a solitary white-robed woman.
"Let us be going," said Wulf. "Here
is another of them with her accursed
cup."
But before they could turn the wom
an gilded up to them and suddenly un
veiled. It was Masouda.
"Follow me, brothers Peter and
John," she said in a laughing whisper.
"I have words to say to you. What!
you will not drink? Well, it is wisest."
and emptying the cup upon the ground
she flitted ahead of them.
Silently as a wraith she went, now
appearing In the open spaces, now van
ishing beneath the dense gloom of ce
dar boughs, till she reached a naked,
lonely rock which stood almost upon
the edge of the gulf. Opposite to this
rock was a great mound, such as an
cient people reared over the bodies of
their dead, and in the mound, cunning
ly hidden by growing shrubs, a massive
door. Masouda took a key from her
girdle, and having looked around to see
that they were alone, unlocked it.
"Enter," she said, pushing them be
fore her.
Then, taking each of them by the
hand, she went forward along a smooth
Incline, till presently they saw the
moonlight and by It discovered that
they stood at the mouth of a cave
which was fringed with bushes. Run
ning up from the depths of the gulf be
low to this opening was a ridge or
shoulder of rock, very steep and nar
row.
"The only road that leads from the
citadel of Masyaf save that across the
bridge." said Masouda
"A bad one," answered Wulf, staring
downward.
"Aye, yet horses trained to rocks
can follow It At the foot Is the bot
tom of the gulf, and a mile or more
away to the left a deep cleft which
leads to the top of the mountain and
to freedom. Will you not take it now?
By to-morrow's dawn you might be
far away.
"And where would the lady Rosa
mund be?" asked Wulf.
"In the harem of the lord Sinanâ
that is, very soon," she answered,
coolly.
"What, then, will avail, Masouda?"
asked Godwin, in a sad voice. "To
promise you money would be useless,
even if we could."
"I am glad that you spared me that
insult," she replied with flashing eyes,
"for then there had been an end. Yet,"
she added more humbly, "seeing my
home and business, and what I appear
to be," and she glanced at her dress
and the empty cup in her hand, "It
had not been strange. Now hear me,
and forget no word. At present you
are in favor with Sinan, who believes
you to be the brothers of the Lady
Rosamund, not her lovers; but" from
the moment he learns the truth your
doom is sealed. Now what the Frank
Lozelle knows, that Sinan may know
at. any timeâand will know, If these
should meet.
"Meanwhile, you are free; so to
morrow, while you ride about the gar
den, as you will do, take note of the
tall rock that stands without, and how
to reach it from any point, even in the
dark. To-morrow, also, when the moon
is up, they will take you to the nar
row bridge, to ride your horses to and
fro there, that they may learn not to
fear it in that light. When you have
stabled them go into the gardens and
come hither unobserved, as the place
being so far away you can do. The
guards will let you pass, thinking
only that you desire to drink a cup of
wine with some fair friend, as Is the
custom of our guests. Enter this cave
âhere is the key," and she handed it
to Wulf, '.'and If I be not there, await
me. Then I will you my plan, if
I have any, but until then I must
scheme and think. JJow it grows late
âgo."
"And you, Masouda," said Godwin,
doubtfully; "how will youÂ«escape this
place?"
"By a road you do not know of, for
I am mistress of the secrets of this
city. Still, I thank you for your
thought of me. Go, I say, and lock
the door behind you."

yr R. OWENS slowly drew a fat
I \f I 81,6611 po<i from the basket
\<v I beside him, split it down the
A middle with his thumb and
sent the peas rattling into the
pan between his knees; then he took
his pipe from his mouth arM yawned
broadly.
"Slow Job, this shellin' peas, ain't
It?"
"Yes," said I. "I often wonder that
no one has invented a way of shelling
them by machinery."
Now it takes a good deal to disturb
Mr. Owens' serenity and peace of
mind, but my innocent remark caused
the phlegmatic gentleman to dash the
empty pod vindictively to the ground
and break out in a splutter of wrath.
"Invention!" he snorted. "Don't
ever say invention to me again. I
wish every feller that ever invented
anything was hung."
.. X was much surprised and asked
him to explain. After some coaxing
Mr. Owens complied with my wish,
and began:
Ter never seed Maria's (my wife's)
Uncle Ephum, did yer? No? Well,
the old man was a queer un, I tell yer.
Richer'n the steel trust, he was; had
thirty acres er 'op gardens and a fish
wier and a quarter interest in a mack
erel boat and Lord knows what more,
besides a lot of cash in the bank. Ma
ria and her first cousin, Siddie, was
the only near relations he had after
his wife, Ant Olindy that was, died.
Well, Siddie and her old man and
Maria and me figgered considerable
on the old man's money and who was
agoin' ter get it when the old man
pegged out. Siddie and her tribe
wasn't on speakln' terms with me and
Maria, owin' to a ieetle squabble we
had over a dog he owned that bit my
brindle heifer and scar't her so she
run onto the railway track and got
made into hash by the up train. There/
was a lawsuit and one thing er an
other ter add ter the general good
feelin' besides.
So me and Maria we guessed that
none of the money was goin' to Siddie,
and Siddie said same thing about us.
Uncle Eph was kinder impartial, as
yer might say. One spell he'd be for
us and have his will fixed up so as we
could get everythin', and next thing
yer know he would twist around and
leave it all to tother side of the fence.
Fust off he come and lived with us.
and he was a trial and no mistake;
â cross-grained and fussy and deefâ
why he was so deef that a cannon
might have gone off by his ear and all
he'd a said would be, "What? Why
don't you speak louder?"
Men Maria put up with It as best
we could and never give him any back
answers and did our best to please
him, knowin' quite well that the meek
inherit the earth.
But he overdone it. He was dreadful
fussy about his eatin', and one time he
took a notion for gooseberry pie.
Nothln' would do but he must have
gooseberry pie. So Maria she cooked a
big one and he et most the whole of
it and was awful sick, and swore we
tried to poison him. He had his will

her old man for most a year.
We was purty down In the mouth,
but everythin' comes to them who
waits, and bimeby he had a row with
Siddie that beat the one he had with
us all to pices. Yer see, Siddle's old
man is an inventor. Up to that time
nothing he had invented was worth
a cent, but he kept at it just the same,
persistent as a hen that wants to set.
Well. Uncle Eph took notions over
there, same as he had done with us.

was millions of 'em 'round him every
night, and that he couldn't get a wink
of sleep.
So Siddic's old man went to work
and invented a machine for drivin'
away the flies. He argued that if you
were campin' out, or fishin' or any
thing where there was lots of flies, that
they'd bite like everythin' when it was
calm, but if a breeze came up they
would all go off. So he rigged up a
contrivance to hang over Uncle Ephs
bed. 'Twas a kind of a windmill thing
like them fans they have in the city
eatin' houses. It hung right over
Uncle Eph's piller and could be raised
or lowered and pulled by a string to
start it goin'. There was a windmill
on the roof that was connected with it
and give it the power.
Well, the very fust night Uncle Eph
tried it he laid down, lowered it close
to his face and hawied the rope that
set her a buzzin' and went to sleep.
Middle of the night he wakes up and
heard a ncise and thought 'twas thieves
come to torture him for his money. So
he sets up in bed andâwhack! one of
of sleep
the arms of that 'ere flymill caught
him right on the ear. He thought 'twas
burglars sure, then, and hollers, "Mur
der!" and "Help!" 'nuff to wake the
dead. An' every time he'd sit up that
fiymfll would knock him down again.
He was purty nigh used up when Sid
die and the old man got to him.
So he was more down on Siddie than
ten thousand of bricks and made- his
will over again, leavin' everythin' to
Maria and me and back he comes to
live with us. This time we thought
Wf had him for keeps, 'cause he was
so dead set agin Siddie and her tribe
that the best name he could get for
them was "murderers," and if you
mentioned inventions he would rave for
hours at a time.
Well, he come along and staid at our
house. A couple of years went by and
he was still with us. Maria and me
began to put down a list of things we
was goin' to buy when the property
was ourn. New melodeon for the par
lor, new whatnot, new cover for the
sittin'-rocm sofy and any quantity of
things. And the old man was gittin'
older, crankier and deefer every day.

If we was say-in' somethin' mighty per
lite. Course, when he'd ask what we
was talkin' 'bout we'd holler that 'twas
a fine day, er like o' that. Yer know
how 'tis when a persc-n is kinder hard
o' hearin'.
Got so it was kind o' a joke, as yer
might say; I'd do it at the table just
for fun. "Have some beans, yer old
image?" I'd ask him, the fust part loud
enough to take the roof off and the rest
in an ordinary tone of voice. And then
Maria'd pucker up her face to keep
from larhn'.
For tbem two years he never men
tioned Slddie's folks, except to run 'em
down, but all at once he began to
change his tune. Begun to wonder how
they was gettin' along and said he
would like to see 'em, till Maria and me
begun to git real worried.
His seventy-eighth birthday was
comin" and we thought 'twould please
him if we made a kind o' celebration of
It. We talked it over some, and Maria
said she'd git up a special good dinner
and a whoppin' birthday cake. I
told her 'twas foolishness, but she was
set on it and said he was old and child
ish and would be tickled to death, so I
let her go ahead.
Wefl, the morning o' his birthday I
hitched up and drove to town to buy
some hay for the cattle, 'cos we'd run
out. Well, when I got home I found
Maria in an orful stew.
Seems she'd gone over ter the Nicjc
erson's ter borrow some sugar and
she and Pashy Nickerson got talkin'
about the minister's wife; how ex
travagant Nathaniel Nixon was since
he got married, and one thing er an
other, till 'twas 11 o'clock 'fore she
started home. On the way she met
Lysander Holmes, who drives the mail
cart, and he says, "Left a package at
your house; 'twas for yer Uncle Eph."
Well, you can imagine how curus
Maria was to find out what was in
that package. She spected 'twas some
of Siddie's doin's right off; but would
you believe it. Uncle Eph wouldn't tell
her. He was in one of his stubborn
fits and said 'twan't nawthin' any
how, and it 'twas' twan't anybody's
business but his; and he wouldn't tell
me, either, when I got home. Me and
hunted for the paper that waa
on the package, so's we could see the
writin' of the address, but we couldn't
find It; he'd burnt it up, most likely.
We had a fine dinner, roast beef and
plum puddin' and heaven knows what,
but nothirf suited Uncle Eph. He
growled at the vittles and said this
was burnt and that was raw, till I got
madder'n a young heifer. Fin'lly Ma
ria went out and fetched the birthday
cake. 'Twas a noble old cake I tell
yer; there was Uncle Ephum on it,
done in red peppermint lozenges;
Maria made the letters so big there
wasn't room for the "m" on the end.
"Here's a big slice for you. Uncle," I
howled, and then I says, in my usual
voice, "Looks as if it would poison
yer, and I hope to goodness it will."
Well, he just grinned and took the
slice and bergan ter eat it and I set
down and pulled my mustache down
so as he wouldn't see my lips move
and commented. I 3artinly did give
it ter him hot and heavy. Maria had
ter cough half a dozen times ter keep
from larfin' out. "See 'im eat," I'd
say. "We've got him this time, Every
mouthful is just as good as a deed to
two acres of that hop field. Have
some more? That's right. We'll kill
the deef old reptile this time. I can
see the melodeon in the parlor. Order
the undertaker, Maria; this is the best
day's work you ever done!"
When he had finished three whoppin'
slices I says: "Better hey a little more,
you old alligator, we want to kill yer
quick; don't want you hangin' along."
Then he gits up kinder slow and de
liberate, lays down his knife 1 and fork
and says:
"No," he says," the old alligator won't
have any more; he's had enoughâof
cake and other things. But I wouldn't
order the melodeon this afternoon if I
was you, and I wouldn't rely on plckin'
them hops this season." And out of the
room he walks, leavin' me and Maria
lookln' like a couple of wax men.
"He can hear!" says she after a
spell.
"He's heard every word we've said!"
says I. Then we both looked at each
other and never said "Boo" for as long
as five minutes. Then we heard Uncle
Eph come stampin' down stairs. He
had his old plug hat on and his cane
in his hand, and he walked out of the
gate and down the road.
"You must foller him," says Maria.
I grabbed my hat and ran arter him,
but he got to town first and went into
the telegraph office. When he came out
I went in and find out who he
telegraphed to, but he had left word
with the clerk to tell no one, so I got
no satisfaction. Maria was fairly danc
in' when I got home.
"He's upstairs in his room," she says,
"with the door locked and he's throw
in' things around like all possessed.
He's been deef for years and years and
how, how, how can he hear now?"
"I don't know," says I, "but I do
know our goose Is cooked if we don't
make it up with him somehow."
So we went upstairs and pleaded and
hollered through the keyhole for as
much as an hour; finally I give Maria
a nudge and we both broke out cryln*
and sobbin' like a couple of waterin*
carts, but all the satisfaction we got
was' him a tellln* us not to strain our
lungs, as he could hear us if we didn't
cry so much like an engine whistle.
At four o'clock somebody drives up
to the gate; 'twas Siddie's old man in
his wagon. Uncle Eph comes hoppin'
right downstairs with his bag filled up.
"Oh, Uncle dear," sobs Maria, "where
be you goin' ?"
"The deef old reptile," says he, "is
goin' ter find another burrow," and he
climbs into the wagon.
"This is your doin's," says I, shakin'
my fist at Siddie's old man.
"Yes," Bays he. grinning. "I'm glad
to say 'tie. Here's something you may
be interested in." And he throwed me
a niece of paper.
'Twas a printed circular and it said.
"The deaf hear! Budd's (that's Sid
die's old man's name) Marvelous
Out-of sight Ear Drums, for restoring
the hearing. Ordinary conversation
easily understood. Entirely Invisible,"
and so on and so on.
"Them's my latest invention." says
Slddie's old man. "I sent Uncle Eph
a pair for a birthday present. He's
been wearin* 'em ever since mornin'.
You can hear ordinary conversation
with them, can't yer, Uncle?"
"Yes," said the old man. "and extra
ordinary conversation, too." Then they
drove off, and I went in and kicked
the remains of that birthday cake from
the kitchen to the parlor and back
again.fp-t NEIGHBOR had been llngerinj

FABLES FOR
Delays Are Dangerous
ONE of the safest subjects on
which the average man may ex
patiate is matrimony. Ifs safe
because no one knows anything
about it, and yet every one is
full to the brim with theories that
would settle the marital problem on
the spot, if they could only find the
right spot. It is also safe for the reason
that no matter what a man thinks
about it he is usually right! he Is
also usually wrong;. That* s the real
beauty of the subjects there are so
many different species and genera and
families of the ancient and honor
able institution of matrimony that
ffs fair to assume that no matter how
eraay and crack-brained a man's
ideas may be he is almost certain to
find some Instances that will fit In
with his generalisation if he will only
wait long enough. He is certain also
to find several thousand eases that
don't come within a hundred miles
of coinciding with his conclusions.,
Therefore It will be perfectly safe for
us to unfold some of the fruits of our
observation and set them up in the
end when Doc he came in.

her good graces. Well, the
wife of the sick man she

she was so grief-stricken,

one of the women and be
gins to cry; and well she
might, for Smith he was a
good husband and never found fault"
with a thing that was or waa not on'
the table at meal time. All of the
women folks thought It was about
time to cry and they cried, and the
men hemmed and hawed, and Smith
he lay there a-fetchln' of his
breath the best he could under the
circumstances. Parson Biglow
went up to the bed and asked
Smith how he felt, and Smith
said he wasn't feelin' at his
best, and no one in the room
disputed the assertion. But
Doc he demurred to the
proceedings; he 'lowed that
sun to dry, sustained and comforted
by the thought that no one would run
away with them if we were to offer
a book of green trading stamps as an
extra inducement.
Having thus fortified ourselves we
shall proceed to reveal the afore*
said fruits. There was a low-browed
individual who rejoiced hi the euphon
ious name of Jenkins. Now Jenkins
waa suffering from an exaggerated
case of ingrown ego. One of the most
serious manifestations of this disease
was in the prevalence of the delusion
that no woman was quite good
enough to bear the burden of his
name and keep tabs on his laundry.
In his early youth he had heard va
rious tales of men who had married be
neath them and were compelled thence
forth to put blinkers on their wives
or tie them in a box stall at home
whenever It was the duty of the male
portion of the outfit to go forth an*
mingle with his fellow-mem This
sad state of affairs made a vivid im- {
pression on the alleged mind of the;
young Jenkins and he vowed that he (
would never, never, wed beneath him. (
Borne of the famous examples of his- )
tory were altogether lost on Jenkins. \
The case of King Cophetua he reject- (
ed as altogether unreliable on account)
of the uncertain character of the mar- \
riage statistics of the time, and also (
because of the fact that a King didn't (
amount to much anyway. Being a cit- )
izen of a free and untrammeled demoo- \
racy, he held to tho belief that an or- (
dlnary King would need to descend)

attach much credence to the sugges- \
tlon that there was Just as much dan- (

Whatever the truth or justice of his )
theory, Jenkins certainly held to it \

who should be able to keep in the run
ning and be right with him at the
finish.
When he was very young and hadnt
secured a firm hold on the philosophy
of life he had what he considered to
be the first symptoms of love's young
dream. The party of the second part
was a girl from his home town with
red cheeks and blue eyes and a light,

IN PRAISE OF HARDSHIP

Some time we shall see, if not now,
low the universe is ordered with a

"But," says the Young Woman Who

naterial advance for if wo are not to

rood and pleasant things which result
rom increasing wealth and advancing

eplied in my hearing the other day:

other virtues of a domestic nature,
but somehow Jenkins began to won

becoming involved with a girl who
was so Ignorant that she didn't have
even a speaking acquaintance with the
broad A and who was likely to say
"ain't got" In a moment of great emo
tion. Jenkins shuddered deep and long
when these terrible thoughts Intruded
themselves in his dreams of bliss and
he pictured to himself this simple rus
tic maiden conversing with the aristo-
periods of luxury when delicate Tiands
pleated the palate and beautiful works
of art embellished the homes of the
fortunate. But waa life Itself any
truer and finer because of the outward
advantages? On the contrary corrup
tion and decay were everywhere evi
dent. The truth Is, easy times and fine
character do not somehow seem to be
long; together."
The practical upshot of the matter
Is not that we should go out of our way
to experience hardship, but that when
it comes our way, as it probably will,
we should stand up under It manfully.
It Is hard, one might as well admit, to
have to rise early and work late, to
have to meet your bills and bear your
responsibilities, in the home. In busi

the loss of money and of friends. It Is

is hard to be misjudged and misunder- i

It wasn't meet and It wasn't flttin' to
cross-question the patient in slch a
manner. Blglow turned about and says,
says he, 1 am a preacher, sir, and I
have a right to talk to him about his
soul.'
" Tea,' says Doc, "but not till after
I get through with his body.'
"Biglow ho was up in matters of re
tort, and he says says he: 'And when
you do get through with his body his
soul will be gone,' and Smith he lay
there actln' like he couldn't find an
other breath. Then Doc he straight
ened up and we all knowed that
somethln' extraordinary was about to
happen. 'If anybody believes strong
enough that Smith here is goin' to
die, he's got a chance to win some easy
money,' said he. "Twenty dollars ain't
picked up every minute, and I'll bet
twenty dollars in gold and put up the
money right now that Smith ain't goin'
to die this season. Any takers?'
"The preacher says, 'Yes, undertak
ers,' which showed to us that along
with his knowledge of divine things he
was sorter sarcastic. A discussion
might have followed, but up spoke Slip
Buckner. He was the bettin'lst man
probably that ever lived, and If a
chance to bet ever got by him It was
in the night when he was in bed and
asleep. Well, he spoke up and says
that he will take the bet, and we all
looked at him, but not with any partic
ular admiration, for he was bettln' on
a sure thing. He fished up his money
outen the seams of his clothes and his
wife she scolded him under her breath,
but he shook his head at her and pro
ceeded with the business in hand.
'Here's my money,' says he, 'and I Just
need twenty more to complete the pur
chase of a yoke of steers that I've had
my eye on for some time.' He looked
at Doc, and so did we all, for we
couldn't see why he would throw away
his twenty dollars. But he didn't
wince. He took out his gold piece and
'Squire Patterson held the stakes, and
after the excitement of puttin' up the
money the wlmln returned to their cry
in' and things were putty much as
they were before, that is, except with
Smith himself.
"Now, Smith he had traveled up and
down the Mississippi River in his

of charm for him. He had sorter

heat over him 'He'll be a

himself. 'Somewhere about

Doc he sorter winced at this, but he

Having made up his mind that Mary

came to really polite log-rolling, he
broke the news to her gently that he

calmly and married a young farmer
with a section of land the next week.
Meanwhile Jenkins foregathered with
destiny and set out to overtake the

"For a long time Doc ho set there
swearln' that ho was sure to win, and
finally he says to Smith that he will
give him half tho money. And Smitk
laughedâyes, sir, laughed, not a loud
haw-haw. It is true, but a chuckle, and
the women cried afresh, for they
thought that Smith waa goin' intc
eternity a-laughln', which to them wai
a mighty bad promise for the future.
Well, we set about tilt evenin', and
when the candles were lighted the fire
on the hearth began to sing a low,
sweet song, imltatin' the sound ol
somebody walkln' through snow, and
we heard Smith breathln* in a natural
sort of way and we looked at him and
he was asleep. Well, to make a long
story short, he was better the next
mornin', and within the time set he waÂ«
walkin' about, and Doo not only gave
him half the money, but all he had
won- And Bucknerâwell, some time
afterward, when Smith was a candi
date for Jestice of the Peace, Buck ha
'lows, T ain't goin' to vote for him He
done me a bad turn onceâbeat me out
of a lot of money.' Doc told me that
he expected to lose the money, but it
was one chance In a thousand that he
might save Smith by excitm' his mind.
"Yes, sir," the old man added after
a few moments of meditation, "a doc
tor must know human nature as well
as medicine, and this knowledge mixed
with medicine is what makes one doc
tor better than another. I've known
'em to git out of their beds the coldest
nights that ever blowed and ride ten
miles to doctor a man they knowed
want a goin' to pay a cent. It takes
great strength always to handle weak
ness; it takes a godlike patience to
deal with the fretful and not be warped
over to the side of continual peevish
ness, and whenever I hear a doctor
a-laughln' I always rejoice with him
Science in medicine travels slow, it Is
true, for each human body is an Indi
vidual machine, and every mornin' has
a new way to go wrong. And I have
known men to be such liars that they
wouldn't tell a doctor the truth as to
how they felt, fearin' that they were
givln' him some little advantage. The
average doctor has a good sense of
humor and has stored up some of the
oldest jokes I ever heard, and this is
in the direct line of his usefulness, for
a sick man can't understand a new Joke
as well as an old one. The old one
may bring up the memory of a former
laugh and thereby do him good.
"The saddest time for the sick man
Is not when the doctor Is comin' to see
him, but the time when the doctor's
bill begins to pay its visits. It ought
not to be, but a doctor's bill Is a mighty
hard thing to pay. It is like payin' for
a January overcoat In July. When old
Alf Bug waa gettin' wellâjust about
the time the doctor pronounced him out
of danger he said to him: 'Doctor, you
have been mighty faithful, and I thank
you, but I'm sorry that I can't pay you
nothln'. If I had died you would have
got your money, for my life is insured,
but as It Is, I can't give you a cent.'
"The doctor looked at him a minute
and says: 'Bug, I think you need just
one more dose of medicine.'
" 'Much obleeged to yon,' replied Bug,
â¢but I've got a plenty.' "

During a short-ration cam-

About the time my boiled shirts, col

thing happened and he was there to
tell me about It A railroad shop In
another town had burned and the
work was transferred to Houston. The
local shop would blaze forth in all its
sulphurous glory the next week and
needed hands in a hurry. In negotiat

he beheld me in tattered overalls and
a 40-cent undershirt manicuring a lean
hack horse. But he was up against
it. So was I, and we agreed to give
each other a trial.
With mingled feelings of Joy and sad

Sunday night and bade farewell to my
fellow chambermaids in the stable. The

DERE was a house party up to
our place on de Sound for to see
de Old Year out and give de glad
hand to de Hew Year. It's a
glad hand X holds out to de Kid
year, for if a de best time for tins dat
happens. As for Duchess, aha makes
so much long green out of our New
Year's house parties she begins to talk
about de restaurant wo are fee have
when wo are rich enough. She being a
forn goll I wonder how she ever lolned
to jolly de way aha does In American
langwudge. Dere is one old lady dat
always comes to our house parties, she
being a kind of a cousin to Whiskers,
and she has more money dan a bank,
and knows how not to part wit it better
dan a pawnshop. Nobody cant get
next to her jean pocket but Duchess,
and I Been how she does it.
I hears Duchess and de old lady when
dey meets In the old lady's room. Deir
song and dance waa like dis:
"Well, Hortenae," Bays Old Lady,
Hortense being de real name of Duch
ess, "Well, I suppose you expect to set
a tip out of me, but you'll be disap
pointed dls time. Money only earns
2 per cent dese days, if a body keeps to
safe investments, and I'm so poor dat
you could tip me better dan I could tip
you."
"Madam will have her joke." says
Duchess, as soft as silk. "I am always
so pleased to see Madam dat It matters
not wedder Madam remembers me or
not. I am delighted to see dat Madam
is looking so young dis year; each New
Year Madam looks younger dan de one
before. It was a chill ride eomine ud
from de station, and I have took de lib
erty of bringing Madam a little cocktail
of de kind dat my husband makes so
wel."
"Your husband, eh!" , snorts Old
Lady, but she fastens on to de drink
and makes a hole in de glass. "Your
husband is a mischievous young man,
night I slept in a real bed -with sheets
and pillowsâthe first spasm of downy
ease that had soothed my youthful
frame in more than two months. At
that I didn't sleep well. It waa too
easy. I missed the rumble of carriage
wheels on the barn floor and the pen
sive snorts of the red stallion who
shared my apartment at the stable.
Then I worried some about the new
Job on which I would debut in the
morning at the magnificent stipend of
two bucks per day. All I cared for was
to hold It down long enough to earn a
get-away stake and fade forever from
the Texas landscape.
While the job lasted I was a great
success at making brake shoes for
freight cars. At the expiration of a
week malarial fever hit me and I took
the count. The shop was located on a
stagnant lagoon, and one week was suf
ficient to All me up with germs. I spent
the next week in my new bed, and got
up dizzy and wobbly and busted. My
prospects made me think of the fellow
who said if he owned Texas and hell he
would rent Texas and live in the other
place. Too sick to work and with my
name stricken from Dun's and Brad
street's, the hotel man said the North
was the place for people with fever and
no money. I agreed with him, and he
accepted my trunk and overcoat as the
first move on a start in the right direc
tion. With the board money thus
saved, by once more divorcing my
goods and chattels I bought a cheap
valise and a cut-rate ticket to Galves
ton.
My scheme was to make New York
by water, and a steamer /from that port
was due at Galveston the day I blew
in. She was anchored outside the bar
waiting on the tide when I reached the
wharf with my little gripsack, one chill
and 60 cents in ready money. The fare
was 550, but that small discrepancy
didn't Jar me. I wore my best clothes,
a new haircut and a silk cap. I had
made one voyage across the gulf as
cabin boy and knew the ropes. If the
steamer had a vacant berth, it was me
to New York in style.
When the big- black hull swung In
to her slip I met the end of the gang
plank coming ashore. There might be
other boys desirous of side-stepping
Texas and I was taking no chances.
But there was no need to hurry. The
steward had all the cabin boys he
wanted, and he fired men ashore again
almost as soon as the gangplank
made connection. That was my finish,
I thought, as I sat on a mooring pile
and gazed hopelessly at the steamer.
Bankrupt, sick and friendless, death
would find me in Texas. In a grand
burst of mental agony I beheld my
bones bleaching in an unkempt alley
behind some livery stable, and my folks
at Mudvllle, 111., awaiting tidings from
the absent one. I even tried to sing,
"Oh, Where is My Wandering Boy?"
but choked on the plaintive melody.
It was Indeed a doleful picture, with
hut one ray of comfort In case I lived
and escaped to the North I would con
secrate my life to warning; foolish
boys away from the Lone Star State.
My own Texas experience, if related
on the lecture platform with me star
ring as the Horrible Example, or pub- ;
lished in tract form, might save many
a boy the hardship and misery I had
undergone. While I still sizzled with
these noble thoughts a bullet-headed
boy In a blue cap and short alpaca
A couple divorced some years ago
could well trace the origin to a streak
of morbid sentimentality on the part
of the wife. The love of the pair was
proverbial, they being quoted every
where as a most devoted couple, who
had passed through the most horrible
vicissitudes only to emerge more help
ful and devoted after each. The hus
band was of an exceedingly sensitive
temperament, ultra-refined In every
way, which the matter-of-fact wife
could hardly appreciate or understand.
The mother of the wife died and among
the floral funeral offerings were an im
mense crown and cross. In those days
there existed quite a fad for embalming
funeral flowers. The wife had this im
mense crown, that required an oval
frame about four feet tall, embalmed,
in the center of which was a large
obituary notice, big enough for a gran
ite shaft. This was hung conspicuously
over the mantel in the parlor, while
the huge cross had an equally conspic
uous place in the bedroom
The light of these morDld reminders
nearly drove the husband frantic. He
begged his wife to destroy them and of
fered to build a chapel In the grounds
of their country home for them; but
she would hear to no other disposition
and wins mil da savings from my sol
vanta when he visits emâbut dla is a
good cocktail."
"Madame la pleased to bo amiable,"
says Duchess. "But it la because of
madame's good health. Surely I never
seen madams looking In such good
healt before. Madame's good healt
makes her of such good nature dat she
will not ears to hear any of de gossip
I has* to tell, because It is all for to
laugh) and madams does not need any
thing to make her laughâexcept her
own good healt and spirits and nature."
"If you mean dat you have any of
your delightful scandal for me, Hor
tense, let me have it quick, for I never
known how wicked all my frens are un
til rye beard your yearly budget of
deir sins."
"If madame will have de poor little
budget of news dat Hortense has kept
for her benefit, den I will oblige her,"
says Hortense. "But we do not have
tea until 5:30, and to wait for tea would
exhaust madame, so I have had cook
put a little bird on de Are for madame,
and my husband will bring a cold bot
tle of de wine M'sieu Paul best likes,
and as madame refreshes herself wit a
moutful and a bite Hortense will tell
her de little news she has saved for
hen"
Dat waa my signal to get busy, and
I soon has de hot bold and de cold bot
in Old Lady's room, and she pecks at
it until de bot was dry . and only de
bones of de bold was left to tell de
tale; and den Duchess she tells her de
record of some ladles and gents dat
would surprise deir parsons to hear.
Old Lady laughs and chuckles till she
near falls in a fit, and by de time
Duchess has finished her off wit a glass
of sweet booze and give her a cigarette
de Old Lady she says, "Hortense, you
are a wicked and witty French goll,
and I don't believe a wold you have
said; but you do amuse me so dat if
you will find me purse I'll see If dere is
a bill in it for you. I'm paying all sorts
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALII
xtry Cfctorles Dryden
Jacket came off the steamer and post
ed a letter across the street. He took
a sharp look at me as he passed, and
on the return trip he paused to con
verse.
"Do you live in Texas?" the boy in
quired, with a aort of loving accent on
the "Texas."
â 'Been there a couple of months,"
was my answer.
"What kind of a place is it?" he
asked in a whisper, at the same time
casting a furtive side glance at the
steamer.
There was such an eager tone in
the query that I tumbled at once. Here
was a New York cabin boy fatally
stuck on Texas, and my tender scheme
to save such giddy youths blew up in
a flash of new hope. I lured him to his
doom the best I know how.
"Texas Is God's .own country," I
said, fervently. "More real sport and
adventure to the square inch than all
the Northern States in a hunch. I've
had the time of my life here," I added,
and which was strictly true, but I
omitted details.
"Well, I'm thinking of k * he
hesitated and blushed, "of stopping off
here awhile. Slinging hash at sea is
too slow for me. I've got a Smith &
Wesson self-cocker. Think I'll need
It?"
"You certainly will," I assured him,
having seen self-cockers hung up
among the unredeemed pledges for
sale in pawnshop windows.
"Good-by, old pard," said the cabin
boy, wringing my hand Varmly, "I
must be going. Mum's the word, you
know."
What he meant by that waa not
clear to me, but It must have sounded
good to him. As the future train rob
ber disappeared aboard ship-1 sneaked
into the wharf shed and watched the
gangway through a crack. What if
he should balk? I asked myself in a
torment of doubt. Things had started
my way, and I clung to the crack like
a nervous gambler waiting for the
turn that would make or break. In
half an hour the bullet-headed boy
popped out of the cabin. He wore his
go-ashore clothes, carried a small
bundle and held one hand on his hip
pocket. That must have been the re
volver ready for instant use. To an
outsider this scene might have sug
gested humorous features, but waa
a sad piece of business. Heaven help
the other bullet-headed boy! And yet
he had more to start with than I did
in launching a Texas career. Doubtless
he got along very well while his health
lasted.
No sooner was he clear of the ship
than I broke away from the crack,
went on board and stood around so
that the steward could fall over me
every little while. It was plain to ob
serve that the chief steward was dis
turbed about something-. He con
ferred with his assistants and they
seemed to be searching the ship.
Finally the chief Interviewed me.
"Ain't you the boy that wanted to
ship a while ago?" he asked.
"Sure," I said.
'Well, bring your dunnage aboard.
We need a boy. One of the crew has
skipped out." All of which was ancient
history to m%v
The upshot of It was I sailed for
New York Impaired in health and
pocket, but vastly'better off than the
than as she intended. The man learned
to dread his home. The effect was hor
ribly depressing - on his sensitive nerves
and he neither ate nor slept until a
physician was called- The husband,
after a time, explained: "I know it
may seem foolish," he said, "but I
cannot tell you the shock and sensation
I experience every time I look up at
those dreadful white flowers."
The wife "pooh-poohed" it as non
sense, despite the warning* of the doc
tor, who, at last, insisted that the
man must leave home for more cheer
ful surroundings. The husband told
his wife very plainly that she must
take her choice between her funeral
wreaths and him The result was that
the husband left home, closed up his
business affairs and providing her with
barely enough to live on left home.
Lawyers were directed to dispose of
the home and its contents, giving the
wife only the bedroom furniture, the
funeral stuff and a few other desig
nated articles.
Erven then the wife refused to "give
in," saying "he would be glad enough
to come back" to her. But, instead, he
became a wanderer. For several years
she never heard from him, and when
he did finally return the wife knew
of stupid people around me who never
amuse and always beg, so why
shouldn't I tip you who never bee; and
always amuse I
Wouldn't you wonder dat a goll dat
can unloosen from a party as hard
to part from deir goods as Old Ladyâ
wouldn't you wonder dat a goil who
can win off such a party wouldn't let
me collect and keep what I can from
de gentst Nay. nay!
Let me tell you, on de level,' nobody
but dose dat are floating In long green
can afford to come to house parties.
It's cheaper to give em dan to go to
cm. Dats a fact. From de stable
boy to de chef, every one Is tipped. De
coachman dat brings a guest up from
de station, de man on de box who
hands em in and out of de traps, de
house footman dat carries deir wraps
up to der rooms, de housemaids dat
fetches deir tea or coffee in de morn
ings, de butler and second man dat
solves, Duchess, of course, who's busy
all over de lot, and meâwell, I'm al
ways on hand âde cook, even de stable
hands and de outside man who shovels
de snow away from de carriage block
âevery mug of us has to be tipped
and tipped again, till I wonder where
de guests gets de long green dey parts
wit when dey is having free board and
lodging at a house party. And de
men! âdey has boxes of flowers and
candy come down from town every
day, dey has card and billiard losses
to make good, andâwell, says, what
fell! And dey pays all dis for what
I gets wit wages. I think we soivants
has* de soft end of de game.
But I was going to tell you about de
time de kiddies had. Little Fannie and
my kid. Little Chimmie is still to our
house, for Little Fannie she sets up
such a holler when I said I would send
Kiddie to me modder for de New
Year dat we had to keep him. Miss
Fannie tells 'em not to get gay on de
' ground floor, what deTlorist and deco
i rator was wolking on for de day be
i fore de party, so dey keeps to Little
boy who succeeded me In the task of
swinging Texas around by the tail. I
trust he potted a few wicked cow
boys and rescued some imperiled
maidens from the lair of the robber
chieftain. Texas is full of just such
jobs waiting for intrepid boys to come
down from the North and straighten
things out. I've done my share toward
the improving and uplifting of that
benighted commonwealth, and if ever
I return to Texas it will be on a writ
of habeas corpus.
All the cabin crew, with the excep
tion of a fat stewardess, built like a
Bartlett, treated me kindly. That good
lady had little to do but fret about me,
though I didn't suspect her secret at
the time. My pallor, due to sickness,
and closely cropped hair interested the
stewardess in my past. She was forever
dragging reform schools and penitenti
aries into the talk when I was around,
and then watching keenly to see me
blush or display other symptoms of
guilt. Beyond a doubt she took me for
a jail-bird. She made it a point to has
ten up and lock her stateroom door on
seeing me near it, and had a habit of
slapping her skirt pocket and feeling to
see if her watch had departed. Not un
til I had been around the world some
more did the conduct of the stewardess
smite me, and then I blushed. Since
then I've had little use for steward
esses, and read with interest newspa
per accounts of them falling overboard
in midocean.
I always wore my hair chopped close
in those days in a style called "shin
gled," and it looked pretty good Now
I would look even better with the top
of my head shingled, weather-boarded
or tar-roofed. And there are others.
We carried but one male cabin pas
senger, and he was a whole shipload of
people, according to his tell. Mr. Evans
"was a retired charcoal burner and a
bad man from the piney woods of
Texas. For twenty years, he said, Mr.
that her choice had been final. She
had grown weary long before of the
depressing causes of her woe and had
dtstroyed them a few months after
the husband's departure in the vain
hope that he would return and, not
seeing them, take her back to his heart.
But it was not to be. No other affec
tion has ever crept into the heart of
either, and although both are growing
old, such a thing as reuniting life's
broken threads seems too hopeless to
be for a moment entertained.
Another case that may serve to show
where a husband's disregard of his
wife's pride broke up a home. The man
was a splendid looking fellow and the
wife equally handsome. Both were
much sought after socially. After sev
eral years of matrimonial happiness the
husband suddenly developed a most
alarming repugnance to dress.
When courting his brlde-that-was-to
be he had always been exquisitely and
Immaculately groomed, which was a
decidedly strong point in his favor.
"He was the cleanest man I ever
saw," she said later, "and that was a
hobby with me."
During: the first five years of their
married life he kept up this lovely trait;
Fannle's play room pretty much. Dey

makes me look up to de veranda; it
was getting dark, but I sees de two
kiddies climbing over de veranda rail
and start to make de ground by de

could make out dey was bote in deir

Evans had been reducing* dense forests
to charcoal at 22 cents per barrel, and
leaving a trail of unmarked graves
among the stumps. What was in the
graves Mr. Evans did not say, yet the
way he spoke of them made our blood
run cold. Between the bad men and my
mysterious prison record the steward
ess yielded to spells bordering on the
hysterical.
The bad man from the charcoal re
gions certainly looked bad, but not in
the sense he wished to inspire theppu r
lie. He wore a slouch hat, collarless
flannel shirt and a suit of rust-colored
Jeans. His brogan shoe tops and trou
ser legs lacked several Inches of meet
ing, and the gaps exposed a pair of
sockless ankles that looked like two
sticks of charcoal. The bad man car
ried his trade mark, all right. Dressed
up and drunk, Mr. Evans wandered
about the ship day and night, inquir
ing in a soft Southern dialect if any
one desired to be killed. We had a
score or so of female suffragistsâfat
and lean ladies with aggressive chins,
heavy brows and funny bonnetsâon the
way to a convention at New York. The
bad man didn't offer to kill any of the
ladies. He was polite and asked them
to drink with him, and promised to ex
pose the innermost secrets of the char
coal burning business.
When not thirsting; for gore Mr.
Evans dozed in a steamer chair on the
forward deck, resting his heels on a
camp stool. This attitude of extreme
nonchalance widened the gap between
trouser legs and brogans and placed
the charcoal ankles prominently before
the public. No one minded this exhibit
but the female suffragists, and they
pestered the captain mightily. It was
a shame, they said, for a man to Invade
polite society with his ankles in that
condition.
"All right, ladies." said the captain,
who was a gallant gentleman. "I'll
have 'em scrubbed for you. Anything
"TEXAS IS GOD'S OWN COUNTRY."
then, by degrees, he began to grow
careless, neglecting to shave regularly,
and other personalities as make a man
attractive. The wife was shocked-
Later he met her at several afternoon
functions where he visibly showed the
lack of a razor's care and wore an old
bicycle cap, rather the worse for wear.
Her dear intimate friends, of course,
hurt her feelings by asking "why" he
did not dress, and one day he Jestingly
remarked that "his wife's hats cost so
much he could not afford to buy a
decent hat." That broke the woman's
spirit entirely. She never accepted an
Invitation after that, but lived the llfo
of a recluse. Nervous troubles resulted,
the pair separated, and the wife finally
became an inmate of an asylum for the
insane.
"We were so happy," she said piti
fully, "until he grew so careless. I
knew people blamed me and I brooded
over it day and night. Now he has
begun to dress himself cleanly again,
but my spirit is all gone!"
Another case of trifles may be cited.

Fannie she got onto de game. When
she went up to see de kiddies have deir
supper neider of 'em could sit down to

10 o'clock to-morrow morning."
That was the third day out from
Galveston, and, sure enough, at 10
next morning the bold skipper and
four deck hands surrounded the bad
man where he sat dozing with his
heels hung up on the camp stool. The
captain stood directly In front of Mr.
Evans, wearing his hands in the side
pockets of a large pea jacket. At a
signal from the skipper the four deck
hands yanked off the brogans and set
in to scour the ankles. Mr. Evans
never moved. The few soots on his
face bare of fuzzy whiskers turned a
dull white, then red, beneath the
shadow of his drooping sombrero.
To appear wholly at ease the bad man
ground out a feeble snore which de
ceived no one. He slept throughout
the operation while the suffrage ladles
looked on in silent approbation; and
when the deck hands had finished,
the ankles of Mr. Evans resembled
peeled beets.
The captain and his accomplices
withdrew. Mr. Evans slept on. When
out of sight and earshot the captain
removed his hands from his coat
pockets. In one he held a match, in
the other a cigar, which he lighted
and went about his business. The
scrubbing incident was closed. That
certainly was a new way to tame a
bad citizen. Mr. Evans was heard of
no more on that voyage. The posses
sion of clean feet broke his proud
spirit and he lurked in obscure cor
ners âsober, sullen, morose and un
happy.
I have withheld the name of the
ship and her captain, both of whom
are still in commission. lest the scrub
bing incident should hurt the traffic in
charcoal burners, retired and other
wise. The skipper exceeded his au
thority somewhat, but Mr. Evans was
new to the sea and didn't know it He
was awed.

THE Hon. W. H. McGuire sat on a
log on the bank of Walnut Creek
getting his paraphernalia ready
for a day's fishing.
Already he had secured his bucket of
minnows and had selected his location
for angling, a pool Just above the riffle,
bordered on the opposite side with
drooping willows that almost reached
down to dabble the ends of their over
hanging branches in the water. If bass
were to be found anywhere in Walnut
Creek, by all indications it should be
right there.
At this particular moment he was en
gaged in putting together his Jointed
bamboo rod: As he lifted the third sec
tion to screw it into place he was
struck with a thought of such startling
nature that he paused involuntarily and
was soon lost In reverie. It had sud
denly come to him that he was lost,
had been lost for many years, and that
he had not realized it until now.
Not bodily lost. He knew his present
location, even to township, range and
section. Nor yet lost in a physical or
moral sense. He was a very good man,
was the Hon. W. H. McGuire. and held
In high esteem by his fellow citizens, as
the last November vote had testified.
But as he sat there there came to him
a sudden memory from his boyhood
days. He had been so very, very busy
these past dozen years that he had
hardly given a thought to the old days.
Now he called to mind Just how his
name looked In the big leather-bound
family Bible, written out in his father's
plain, old-fashioned hand. "William
Henry, third son of John and Mary Mc-
Guire."
He thought of that September morn
ing when he had started for college. All
the boys and girls of his set were down
to the 8:80 train to see him off. His last
memory of their faces was the glimpse
he had from the car window as the
train pulled out of the station. The
boys had yelled "Good-by, Billy!" and
the girls had shouted "Be a good boy,
Billy!" and had waved their handker
chiefs until shut from sight by the
curve around Gravelback Hill. Now
the fact dawned upon him that was the
last time he had heard a friendly voice
say "Billy."
In college he had been plain McGuire.
During the time he was reading law In
the office in the city he was "young
McGuire." Then, when admitted to the
bar, he had hurried away to the West
.to woo fame and fortune; had picked
out the county seat as an eligible place
to begin, and, for a time, was W. H.
McGuire, attorney. Later he became
"our leading lawyer, McGuire," and at
last, "our eloquent yo-ung orator and
present Representative from this coun
ty, the Hon. W. H. McGuire."
As he felt the breath of the south
wind blowing up creek and listened to
the whistling of the redblrds he
thought, for the moment, that he would
gladly give all his honors for the sake
of hearing the boys say "Billy" in the
old, careless, affectionate way.
"Do you care if I fish In this hole,
too?"
McGuire looked up. A ten-year-old
boy, with a fishing pole across his
shoulder, stood before him. The lad
had a sunburnt face beneath his
straw hat, and his deep blue eyes set
McGuire puzzling as to when and
where he had seen their like before.
Aside from the straw hat the boy's
wardrohe consisted of two essential
garmentsâa checked *mt and a pair
of blue denim overalls, held in nlace by
a Kolltary suspender.
"Do you care if I fish In this hole,
too?" repeated the boy, not quite sure
whether or not the gentleman had
heard his first query.
Mr. McGuire did not care. In fact,
be would be very giad to have his
company. He said so.
y "This lfa my pa's crick.' volunteered
the boy; "but he lets anybody fish in it
*at - ants to." i
He unwound the line from his hick- (
ory pole, dug a worm-cut of the dirt in
his old tomato can, impaied It, spat i
on the bait and cast It with a swish (
Into the pool. Mr. McGuire went to his
own bait can, selected a nÂ»innow, hook- *
ed it through the back and made a i
long cast into the deep water by the
willcws. I
"Do you use mlnnies for bait?" (
"Yes. I'm fishing for bass."
"And can you catch 'em that way?" '
"Sure! Can you catch 'em any other(
way?" /
"No, I can't. I've tried lots o* times, ]
too. I've seen 'em in the clear waterâl
great big fellowsâand I've tried timet
and time again with nice fat grub-j
worms. They'd always swim around, ]
sort o' lazy-like, and act like they was\
smellln' the bait, and then they'd sort'
Â©' turn up their noses and swim off like (
they waa sayin' T ain't much
for grubs to-day.' I thought there ought )
to be some sort o' bait they liked, but\
I never could make out what it was. (
Oh, look-ec! You've got a bite!" ;
Mr. McGuire was already looking.
His line was cutting through the water
at a tremendous rate. He checked the i
reeling out of the line with his thumb }
tor an instant to make sure of fasten- \
lng his fish, felt satisfied with the sharp
tug at the line and slowly reeled out
more line. He played his captive back
and forth, keeping it just out of the
overhanging willows, and at the end of
five minutes landed his fish. It was the
first time the boy had witnessed the
scientific capture of a black bass.
"Isn't he a beauty! He's a whole foot
long, and I'll bet he weighs two pounds
If he weighs anything at all! Why, I
didn't know there was a fish that big in
this crick!"
Mr. McGuire laughed an almost boy
ish laugh. "It's a pretty good morning
for bass. This place hasn't been fished
much, anyway, I should judge. I
shouldn't wonder If the whole creek
is full of them."
The boy's face was worth seeing. He
hesitated a moment and then asked:
"Say, mister, what's your name, any
way?"
"Mâ" Then Mr. McGuire paused.
Then he said, "My name? Oh, well, I
guess when I go fishing with a boy it's
my boy nameâBilly. I think we will
have a first-rate time to-day if you
Just call me Billy. At least I shall."
The bey pondered a moment.
"My name's TommyâTommy Has
kins. SayâBillyâdo you s'pose I could
catch a bass on my hook with your
kind of bait?"
"Why, yes. You may not have as
much fun out of it as you would have
with a reel; but If you don't Jerk too
hard you'll probably catch as many as
I do. Help yourself to the bait."
"Have you good'n' plenty?"
"He is certainly good mannered,"
mused Billy. Then aloud: "Plenty?
Oceans of them. Besides, when I go
fishing I always go snooksâcahootsâ
partners, you knowâwith the other
fellow. The bass will not bite much
more than half an hour longer, and
then we'll have to try for sunfish and
bluegills, and youll have to divide your
worms with me."
The boy was unaffectedly delighted.
Billy showed him how to bait his
hook, meanwhile explaining to him
the'theory of proper baiting. Then he
busied himself with his own line.
"Oh, Billy!"
That was all. But It told volumes
of excitement and gratified triumph.
Billy looked around. The hickory fish
pole was bent, the line stretched taut
and flinging off a little spray of water
in the sunshine, and the boy's arms
were stretching out, further, further.
"Wade in' Wade in, I tell you! He'll
break the lineif you don't wade in!
Wade up creek!"
If the command had been to wade
through fire the boy would have obeyed
unhesitatingly. In he waded.
"That's right! Hold your pole side
ways, so he'll take the spring of the
pole! Good boy! Now do it again, and
keep doing it every time he turns.
You'll make a fisherman yet."
Back and forth the boy played the
fish, until it shewed signs of tiring.
"Now draw him inâgently. Hold
your pole sideways. If he makes a
rush with the pole held straight he'll
break the line. Lift him outâstill side
ways. I'll declare, if he isn't an Inch
longer than mine!"
Tommy Hasklns looked Joyously on
the dark stripes of the bass as it lay
there on the gravel, flopping and palpi
tating by turns. He could think of
nothing better to say than:
"I caught him all by myself, didn't
I? I wish my pa could have been here
to see me!"
When the bass had ceased biting they
had five beauties, three to the credit
of Tommy Hasklns. Billy put them In
the fish basket and anchored them in
the running water at the ripple. The
boy now yielded to his social Inclina
tions.
"Whereabouts do you live, Billy?"
"Oh, I stay up at the county seat.
My boy home was back Eastâin Indi
ana."
"Indiana! Why, there's where my pa
and ma came from! They talk about
back there sometimes."
"Say," said Billy, struck with a sud
den thought, "I'll tell you what, Tom
my Hasklns! You take these fish down
to the house and give 'em to your ma,
and ask her to cook 'em for supper!
And tell her you have a particular'
friend fishing with you to-day, and
that you'd like to have him down for
supper. And tell her he's from Indi

woman on whose tombstone was
carved this epitaph, but I have
met her counterpart many times.
And it may profit us all to pause a
moment and reflect Upon the meaning
of such a summing up of a life carrer.
How simple such a characterization is,
how unconventional, how different
from the ones which appear with al
most wearisome monotony In every
churchyard. And yet how adequate
it is, too, how elusive and beautiful.
To be able to utter these six words
about a man or woman whose life race
is run is as much of a compliment as
a large volume of glowing praise.
Capacity, willingness, action, when
those three traits are properly blend
ed you cannot fall to get a strong,
fruitful character. And almost all the
tragedies In human life, almost all the
mistakes and blunders are due to the
absence of one or more of these quali
ties or to their being faultily related
to one another.

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL!
When Tommy Haskins got back Billy
had a flre * oln &- H Â« had also taken
the for a tablecloth and had
spread a dinner that looked very tempt -
'iB to the country boy. There were
material buried in many a man's na
ture simply because he has not courage
to mine for it and bring it out into the
open. Hundreds of people may be able
to do any number of things be tter th v
you can, but there is at least one thing
and perhaps more that you can do as
well as any one else and probably bet
ter than a good many others.
"She would." Capacity waa yoked
with willingness ;a this woman's case.!
"I will try" represented l.er attitude
through life. When people came to her
to gain her help in some worthy under
taking, they did not have to break
down a great wall of reluctance. She
was ready to take the responsible post
assigned her, to give of her substance,
her time, her ingenuity or the welfare
of others. How many desirable re
forms would be accomplished, how
much faster the chariot of progress
would advance, how many struggling
little enterprises would gain a solid un
derpinning if the people who could help
them were only willing to do their
part. Oh, cultivate the willing, com
pliant and not the demurring, object
ing disposition.
BY KTl/i/EX
"She did." Ah, there is the fruitage
of It ail. The world wants people who
do things. Many capable and willing
individuals stop Just short of perform
ance. They possess ability, they are
full of kindly intentions, but somehqw
the letter of sympathy never gets writ
ten, the call upon some forlorn person
never gets made, the means of per
sonal .culture close at hand is never
actually laid hold of. So golden days
pass away with nothing tangible ac
complished. So long ago as the first
century there lived a woman by the
name of Dorcas, who we have reason
to believe was not brilliant intellectual
nam sandwiches and a bottle of stuffed
olives, and cheese, and cookies, and
oranges, and bananas, and a tin box
of sardines. Billy explained: "I al
ways take some fish with me when I
go fishing. Then, if you don't catch
any, why, I have fish anyhow."
Then Billy cut a coupie of small
hickory sprouts, and, sharpening an
end of each, gave one to Tommy Has
kins and said: "Now you do Just
what you see me do. I'm going to show
you how to cook." Then he took three
of the slices of bacon, impaled them
and held them over the bed of coals
to broil. Tommy Haskins did likewise
with the other three slices. Soon a
tantalizing, appetizing odor came from
the bacon as the grease sputtered down
on the hot coals, and the raw sides of
the strips took on a delicate brown.
"U-m-m! I didn't know bacon could
smell so good. It fairly makes my
mouth water."
"It tastes as good as it smells, too,
on a picnic like this," responded Billy.
It was a glorious dinner. Tommy
Hasklns said as much, and Billy heart
ily agreed with him. It was the first
time Tommy Haskins had ever tasted
sardines. He said they were "awful
good." Billy did not care for any. He
said so. That is why Tommy Haskins
ate them all. Real French sardines are
good. Billy said he had his mouth
fixed for bass lor supper and he didn't
propose to spoil his appetite by filling
up on sardines. Tommy Hasklns was
sure it would not affect his appetite.
He did not like the stuffed olives, how
ever, and said so frankly. Billy liked
stuffed olives and ate them all. He ex
plained that stuffed olives always gave
him an appetite for bass; and then
each of them ate three slices of broiled
bacon and wished for more. When the
last crumb of the dinner had disap
peared they looked at each other and
smiled.
Then it was that Tommy Haskins
said, "Billy, did you ever hear tell of
folks eatin* frogs?"
"Yes."
"Well, but do you believe it?"
"Why, yes! In fact, I've eaten them
many a time myself."
"Gee!"
"They're good! Better than spring
chickenâa whole lot better!"
"Gee-ml-nee Crickets!"
"They are. You Just take the hind
legs, skin them, roll them in cracker
dust, fry them in butter, and they're
Just âhonkey!"
"Say! I know where there's a whole
million of 'em. But we haven't no gun
nor nothin' to shoot 'em with."
"You do? Then we'll have a few! I
know how to get 'em."
Billy cut a bit of red cloth from the
corner of the laprobe and proceeded to
wrap the hooks.
"Anything red makes a bullfrog an
gry. It's like shaking a red rag at a
bull. You want to pick out your frog,
hold the hook out in front of him and
ten chances to one he'll make a Jump
for it and get caught. We'll have more
fun this afternoon than we can shake
. stick at."
They fished for frogs with fair suc
cess until late in the afternoon; then
they started back to where they had
left the horse and buggy. They loiter
ed by the way and built a little dam
of stones across a shallow riffle. They
sent fiat pebbles skipping across the
surface of the water. They answered
the piping call of the quail somewhere
out in the green wheat field. At the
cave, where the sandstone cliff- arched
oyer the creek, Billy discerned some
slight depressions in the dry dusty floor
of the cave, such as one might make
by pressing the finger tips gently into
a little heap of dust. ,
Billy asked Tommy Haskins If the
had ever seen the doodle bugs, and re
ceiving a negative answer and the ex
pression of Tommy Haskins' utter dis
belief in their existence, he dropped
down on his hands and knees and be
gan repeating the time honored formu
la for charming doodle bugs from their
subterranean home. The little mounds
of dust began to tremble, and then the
little dusty beetles came forth and
whirled round and round In a very ex
cited manner indeed. The boy looked
his utter astonishment and then ex
claimed:
â¢'Billy, I b'lieve you know purt' nigh
everything!"
Billy smiled and replied: "I guess you
know a thing or two yourself. Say! Do
you s'pose your ma has scaled those
fish yet?"
"I don't know, but I bet she cooks
'em all right. Once my ma was sick
and we had a hired girl, and we purf
nigh starved to death! Pa could beat
her cookln' hisself. I heard him tell
ma so. But you just wait till you taste
my ma's cookln'!"
When they drove out into the smooth
road along the west side cf the sec
tion, Billy handed Tommy Hasklns the
lines and said:
"Now you drive a bit. Hold a good
tight line, chirrup twice and I guess
Prince will not need any whip."
Tommy Hasklns squared his elbows,
chirruped twice and the roadster Shot
forward with a suddenness that almost
took the boy's breath. Prince could do
a 2:40 clip and it was the first time
Tommy Haskins had ever drawn line
over anything faster than one of hfs
pa's old farm horses. The fence posts,
the grazing cattle, the row of catalpa
trees along the roadside, all seemed to
be flying In the opposite direction.

tend to do to-morrow or next week, but
this Dorcas of the first century clung
to her intentions till they became real

characterized as "full of good works
which she did." There is a little
touch of irony in those last three words,

our actual performance comes far'

Bped on the faster. Tommy Haskins
gave a sideways glance of alarm at
Billy.
"Is heâls heârunning off?"
But Billy only laugned and said:
"Ease up a bit on the liner and see."
Tommy Haskins slackened the lines
and very soon Prince had slowed down
to a walk. The boy turned to Billy
with delighted eyes, albeit his voice
was tremblii â jus* a Ifttle.
"When I get to be a man I'm going
to have a trotting horse âjust like
him!" ,
They walked Prince the rest of the
way and when they came to the strip
of alfalfa along the creek bottom,
now in full bloom and ready for the
first cutting, Billy laid his hand on
the lines and stopped the horse. The
odor of the bloom was beginning to
rise with the early falling dew.
"Smells mighty good, don't it? But
I Just got a sniff of somethin' a heap
nicer. Don't you smell it, tooâma's
coffee b'il'n'?"
When they reached the ranch house
door Tommy Haskins' ma met them
and started to extend Tommy's com
panion a hearty Kansas greeting and
to say that supper was already on the
table, when she paused, scrutinized
Billy's face closely and exclaimed:
"Good land alive! If It isn't Billy
McGuire! Pa! pa! Come here this
mlnut'! Here's Billy McGuire that I
used to go to school with back in In
diana, long before I ever saw you!
My memory's better'n yours, Billy
McGuire! You don't know me? Don't
you recollect the girl that used to
hold you with one hand and wash
your face in a snowbank with the
other? Well, I'm her!"
Then Billy replied, while the sound
of his boy name, spoken in an old
time voice, ran through his veins like
wine: "Molly Briggs, sure as I live!
I thought this morning that I had
seen those eyes of Tommy's some
where before!"
Tommy's pa came forward, smiling
and shook hands cordially with Billy
McGuire and asked him if he had
just come out to Kansas.
"Why, no!" said Hilly. "I've lived
at the county seat for the last ten
years."
"Well," put in Tommy's ma, "we've
been out here a dozen years this
spring, and the last six of 'em right
here on Walnut Crick. How on earth
does it happen that we've never heard
tell of you?" Then a flash of intelli
gence lit up her face. "It can't beâ
yes, it is so, too. Pa, I'll declare if
you didn't vote for Billy last fall!
Don't you rememberâFor Represent
ative, W. H. McGuire'? I noticed the
name at the time, but I never thought
once of its beln' Billy!"
After supper they insisted that Billy
had to stay all night. But Billy de
clared that he was compelled to take
the morning train for Topeka to look
after a case he had in the Supreme
Court. So they did the next best thing,
and made the most of an old-fashioned
evening visit that lasted until the
hands on the big, old-fashioned clock
pointed alarmingly to the XII on its
face.
Tommy Haskins sat wide-eyed all
evening listening to the talk about the
Smiths and the Wigginses and the Dil
llngbecks, and about the church festi
vals at the chapel, where, town against
country boys, a cake was voted to the
prettiest girl. And the country girl was
the winner. And of all things! Her
name wasâMolly Briggs! And then
and there Tommy Haskins resolved
that, when he went back with his ma
to visit at gran'pa's next fall, he would
see at least two places. He would see
Wesley Chapel, where his ma had been
voted "the prettiest girl"; then he
would have her show him the identical
spot where she had washed Billy's face
In the snowbank.
When Billy had at last satd goodby
at the front gate, and had promised to
come back the next Sunday week and
stay all day, the moon was riding high
in the sky, and the rmooth road was
almost as light as day. At the cross
road he turned to look back, and- saw
them slowly walking toward the bouse.
Tommy Haskins and his ma and his
pa, hand In hand.
As he faced about and drew the lines
with a firmer grip, his thoughts fell
into rhythm with the rhythm of his
horse's clattering feet, and both seemed
to say over and over:
"Billy McGuire-~ls found-ls found!"a > V AM going to add another bau
* I ble to my Hit," says tho girl
X with a fad. "Com* you along."
And Into a shop of almost any
description they go, for be It known
that the ghi with a fad Is as full of
whims and fancies as an egg is of meat,
ggg| ihe never tires of mounting her pet
hobby and riding Just a Mttle farther
down the alluring lane of extravagance.
On* notion that ha* caught th* eye
of *very caprlclou* lassie Is th* new
treasure box. that come* In th* form
of * hand bag. In reality It 1* ft small
Crunk, but such a convenient on* that
ther* does not llv* th* woman who
â¢would call it a nuisance and deliberate
ly leave It behind her.
In the first place, It Is made of some
soft skin, frequently seal, and will
stand any amount of wear and tear and
â¢>et remain In good condition. On* side
of the bagâfor It is divided, as a suit
case, into two partsâis used for money
and the other is divided into compart
ments, one for a small gold purse, an
other for cards, still another for a wee
tablet and pencil and yet one which is
for the crowning gloryâthe mirror and
powder puff. But don't Imagine for a
'single instant that the powder is placed
in the purse proper, for it most de
cidedly is not. Instead there is a small-,
er one, resembling in every particular
the old-fashioned card case. One side
is a mirror, the other the powder box,
and it is no rare thing to see a well
groomed woman slip this contrivance
from her bag and deliberately powder
the end of her nose with half th* occu
pants of a swagger grill looking on
and smiling In an Indulgent fashion.
Of course, it goes without saying
that this novelty will soon be made up
in a variety of inexpensive materials,
and that every Tom, Dick and Harry
will be swinging them along the streets,
tut it will be no difficult problem to
tell the good from the phony, and only
th* well dressed woman will be able to
match her smartest frocks to a nicety.
ThÂ« woman who indulges in any fad
Is extravagantâmarvelously so. And,
what Is worse, she grows more extrava
gant day by day. But be this as It may,
ft Is quite certain that there is abund
ant excuse for liking and even going
one step farther and loving the new
fashions and dainty vanities, for they
are not only smart to the last degree,
but are so chic and beautiful withal
that they absolutely coax into pretti
ness any woman who is so fortunate
as to possess them
The girl -who spends much of her
time in the open has a run on cuffs.
Great, wonderful cuffs, made of the
softest laces, the rarest embroideries
and trimmed with the most elaborate
Oriental designs. Her skirt may be one
of those seven-gored affairs that boasts
that each and every gore is cut
straight and the blouse may be so cun
ningly fashioned as to look almost se
vere, but the cuffs are set upon her
coat in a truly wonderful manner, and
not only prettliy dress up her hand,
but at the same time form a finish and
a trimming to the coat.
Sometimes the elegant little frills
ere made of straight bands of embroi
dery, flaring a bit at the too. to make
them fit at the wrist, and again they
are stiffened and trimmed with differ
ent Jewels. The laces and soft mulls
may be sent to the cleaner's, for each
gown demands at least two sets of
frills, and in this respect the cuffs cer
tainly are more economical, for they
are made to slip off and on the gar
ments and one pair can be used for any
number of coats.
But, fad or no fad, cuffs there must
be, or else one is worse than a thou
sand years behind the times, which is
Just about as bad aa being- non est.
The Paris girl came over with the most
wonderful stiff Chinese embroidery in
all sorts of colors on a white broadcloth
coat, and she even dared to show th*
Western girl queer little bits of Inlaid
Japanese stuffs that have always been
considered beautiful, but auite too
gorgeous for practical use. But now
it's to the wily Chinese, for if one
makes any sort of pretenses one can
scarcely be too Oriental as regards
cuffs and belts, nor -too Oriental aa re
gards the trimming of one's lapels and
the decoration of the yoke, and vest.
This whimsical creature of fads, bless
her, always keeps every one amused
and guessing. Her friends never know
Just what to expect nor when she is
going- to break out next. One minute
she begs, borrows or steals all the Jew
elry Bhe can lay her hands on and the
next appears as the forerunner of fash
ionable simplicity. But with Oriental
fabrics must come Oriental Jewelry.
The fanciful headgear that is fash
ioned of silver or gold and set with
queer stones is not half, no, nor a third,
the stranger it used to be. and the ex
quisitely fashioned bracelets and
buckles that were once regarded as
decidedly vulgar and queer are Just the
very things that Mlladi scrambles
madly after, for she has come to the
conclusion that the Orient knows what
will enhance a woman's charms a hun
dred-fold.
The feminine fluff-fluff is not the only
lassie who rides a hobby by any man
ner of means. The mannish srirl comes
in for her share of the spoils, and she
is not content with a mean portion,
either. Now, bear in mind that man
nish does not necessarily mean freak
ish, and that there are mannish girls
and mannish girls.
The really, truly mannish type Is
the one who prefers the severe cuts
and plain elegance to billows of flimsy
tissues, even though it Is quite the
loveliest of the lovely. The gown that
Is beautiful aa a dream and the mar
vel of fineness is not for her, and not
for her by choice, remember you. Laco
and chiffon, lovely as it is, is set
strictly aside, and she revels in being
absolutely and faultlessly tailored.
One thing- she does not deny herself,
and pray tell what woman could. Purs.
The mannish girl, and she haa gotten
her name because she is always an
out-door girl, revels in furs. She la
clothed in them from her head to her
heels and back again, and each article
she wears is either made of fur or
trimmed with it, or at least haa a furry
appearance.
Of all whims perhaps the erase to
own furs, and furs of all kinds and
descriptions, is the most satisfying; one.
There Is always soroetTring so flashing;
about the wearer of them. She Is not
smart, merely, nor is she merely
stylish. Instead, she possesses both of
these qualities to a marked degree and
besides a bit of dash Just for good
measure.. In fact, she has such a way
with her, such a awing, such a bang,
such an elegance, that to sare one's
life one cannot help thinking her the
most fetching thing under the sun.
So here's to the girl with a fad.

MRS. J. M. (Sulphur Bath).âThere
are two ways of preparing: a sulphur

either by adding; one ounce of sulphuret

sulphuret of calcium for every fifteen

ANNIE (Warts).âWarta are mean
things to handle, aa nearly every treat
ment results In sears. One way is to
tie a silk or a silver thread tightly
round the wart, for It will then shrivel
and drop off, when the base can be
cauterised with a nitrate of silver stick.
Common warts may be removed by ap
plying strong acetic add, nltrlo acid,
caustic potash, lunar caustic in pencil
or tincture of chloride of Iron. In put
ting on any of these remedies care
must be taken not to touch the sur

MARY (Comfort In Slight Illnesses).â
80 much Is done for the really seri
ously sick person by relatives and
friends and trained nurses that X
sometimes think that it is the "half
slck," those with colds and Indigestion
and headaches, who actually suffer the
most.
It is really these small illnesses that
make martyrs of busy people. The
man who goes to his office and counts
up figures with a sick headache and
the woman who gets through the fami
ly cooking with a bad attack of dys
pepsia come pretty near being heroes.
But who sympathises with them or
brews delicate dishes or adjusts the
light or stops the noise or brings flow
ers? They are unsung, unheralded, and
it will always be so. Your own courage
is generally a substitute for other peo
ple's sympathy.'
The important point to bo made,
however, is not Just how much con
dolence is motod out to tho partly
sick, but that so many of the small ill
cesses can be prevented by Jturt a few,
â¢lmple, Inexpensive precaution*.
Half the tiresome headaches could bo
done away with by careful solentlflo
ventilation, colds and even grip pro
vented by the right sort of cold morn
ing plunge, and no end of poor ap
petites cured with tho proper hygienic
cleaning of rooms with harmless disin
fectants.
Wo forget that it Is normal to be
well, and that most of our little sick
nesses are caused by lack of circula
tion, lack of distributed air, lack of
sufficient alert outlook for the gre
garious energetic microbes.
Now there are three easy methods of
meeting these difficulties: Tho first la
by distributing air in sleeping apart
ments by opening one window a little
at the top and tho other a little or
much, if you will, at the bottom. This
keeps up a constant movement of
fresh air through the room as no air
ing wholly from the-lower part of a
window can. If the bed is In a lino with
the window, opened from below, place
a screen In front of, out a foot or so.

If you have a warm bedroom or
bathroom, stimulate the circulation by
a dally morning cold bath. In a tubâ
If you have the reaction âbut a cold
â ponging off surely. Nothing Is so cer
tain a preventive of sensitive lungs
and throat as this splashing of cold
water over the chest and neck every
morning.
And even when a cold Is started, II
can be checked by regular cold plunges
If followed by an alcohol rub.
To get the full benefit of a cold bath
you must rub dry very quickly. This
is impossible If tho bath is taken in
hard water. 80 if you cant got rain
water, add a little borax powder to the
bath, and you will find the water as
soft as a summer shower.
The third Important method of saving
oneself from small ailments is by the
use of a certain amount of disin
fectants In cleaning, so many of the
most useful antiseptics either render
the hands sore or have some sort of
unpleasant odor, or are expensive or
poisonous that even tho best house*
keepers get In the way of depending
upon soap and water, which means
rooms fresh and pretty, but not by
glenlcally dean.
The simplest, cheapest and one of
the best antiseptics is a solution of
borax water. If woodwork floors,
hardwood chairs, windows, bathrooms
and sinks are all regularly cleaned with
hot water holding a solution of borax,
a teaspoonful to a basin of water, the
house will be absolutely clean from a
physician's point of view, that is germs
as well as dust will be gone, and with
the germs will vanish many a head
ache, many an attack of dyspepsia and
much of so-called malaria
This solution will not injure wood

white.
It Is, of course, a very fine thin* to
be brave and patient about our small
Illnesses; but it is far more cheerful to
be normally well and put our nerve
force into pleasure and business.IN this enlightened age when ad
vancement Is ever the watchword,
It is surprising the large strat
um of Ignorance that exists where
knowledge is supposed to prevail.
And right here I want to say that this
applies in a superlative manner to the
lack. of properly taking care of one's
self through the medium of vigorous
exercises, proper breathing and regular
diet, not only as a means of regaining
perfect health, but of retaining it. In
my travels over the country it has fre
quently come to my observation what
a remarkably small percentage of the
average community there is that really

is absolutely necessary.

HIS LITTLE. MASCOT
BRADLEY paused at the door of
Miss Kane's studio, listened
a moment to the sound of
smoothly struck chords and
then gave an apologetic- knock.
Tho muslo ceased and the door was
opened by Miss Kane, teacher of vocal
music.
"Ton know better," she said forbid
dingly.
"Yes," he said with penitent air,
**but I am not a visitor. I came on
professional business, really," and he
walked on Into the room.
"Do you want your voice tried?"
ahe asked sarcastically.
"No, I don't want you to score an
other point against me, but I called to
see you in regard to your pupil, the
little girl Pattl. I understand she is
â  to make her debut at the Charity Con
cert to-morrow night. I want to write
her up."
"Oh!" ahe exclaimed, interested but
still skeptical, "and since when did the
city editor himself take to writing 'In
a Minor Strain' column?"
"Miss Fleming is ill," he replied,
"and we are all helping her out. I vol
unteered to take this part of her work.
I thought, Miss Kane," he said earn
estly, "that it would be to your advan
tage and to that of the child to get
satisfactory press notices, and I will
write whatever you wish."
"Thank you very much, Mr. Brad
ley," she replied her little air of re
serve melting for the once. "I shall be
very glad if you will do so."
"Now, what kind of a voice has
she?"
"High soprano. Her voice is per
fectly placed. When I discovered her
pure tones âI heard her first In a school
I had her come to the studio. I
sounded low C on the piano and asked
her to sing the note. She did, with
perfect attack and pitch. Then she
kept on with the successive tones and
half tones until we came to B flat. I
began to tremble, for there begins the
middle register, the stumbling block of
nearly all singers, but the right qual
ity came into her voiceâthat imper
ceptible shading of the chest tones as
they merge Into the smooth waters of
the soprano's realm. The tones kept
. coming clearly, sweetly and with a sil
very ring until I didn't dare take her
any farther." , m _ .
"I suppose it's all right," said Brad
â¼eloped in. Japan is proved in the fact
that the Japanese, while a diminutive
race, possess the greatest endurance of*
any people on earth. Not enough exer
cise has killed more humankind than
the over indulgence of it. Play, run,
romp, Jump, swim, skate, golf, use the
medicine ball, ride the bicycle, breathe
the fresh pure air of glorious out-of
doors, absorb all the sunshine you can,
and with the end of each successive
year you will find your physician's bill
growing smaller and beautifully less.
I do not pretend to be an expert in
the line of physical training, but what
I do know has been gained by experi
ence, and such I willingly give in the
way of advice to my readers, hoping
that if followed the effect of such a
course may be as beneficial to them as
it has been to me. I do think that never
should any set rules be laid down be
cause with the use of a little common
ley with a perplexed smile, "but it s
all Greek to me. If her voice was per
fect by nature, why are you giving
her lessons?"
"I have made her voice stronger and
more flexible; have taught her phras
ing and enunciation."
"I think you had better write a lit
tle sketch of her personality and voice
and I will publish it."
There came a light rap at the door
and a slender, little wisp of a girl with
big, brown eyes and golden hair came
into the studio.
"This, Mr. Bradley, is my little song
bird,. Louise Harvey."
Bradley was very fond of children.
He shook hands with the little song
stress, and, turning to Miss Kane, said:
"Is it possible that this microscopic
child can sing so gloriously as I have
heard it intimated."
The little girl drew herself up with
a suspicion of hauteur.
"I am in my teens!" she protested.
"That does give one an old feeling,"
he said with a laugh. "I haven't for
gotten the first day I could say so
proudly, T am in my teens.' "
"Have you been out of them long?"
Miss Kane could not forbear asking.
The bright eyes of Louise sparkled
with appreciative mirth.
"Miss Louise, you mustn't make fun
of me. I have the power to make or
mar public personages. I am going
to put your picture in the paper to
night and the day after to-morrow I
shall tell how well you can sing."
"Thank you," said the little girl sim
ply, "but I must go now. I came to
return this music, Miss Kane."
"I will go with you," said Bradley.
"We will stop at the florist's and or
der some flowers for you to carry at
the concert."
Louise flushed wit*- pleasure as she
left the room In company with Brad
ley.
"I like Miss Kane. She is lovely
to me," she confided when they were
out on the street.
"I wish she would be lovely to me,"
he said ruefully.
"Is she mad at you?" asked Louise,
ingenuously.
"Yes, music mad; but, unfortunately,
I can only appreciate music from a
ragtime standpoint, so I can't creep

every one in the first place Is to be out

Why don't you Jump in?" asked
Louise.
He stopped abruptly and looked re
flectively at her.
"That's a very good Idea, Miss
Louise. Thank you."
When they reached the florist's and
Louise had selected the roses he was
to send to her on the morrow, Brad
ley said:
"Now, I will make my first Jump
and send Miss Kane some roses, too."
"Send her violets," replied the little
girl earnestly. "They are her favorite
flower."
"Thank you again. Miss Louise. You
are certainly my mascot."
He ordered a huge bunch of violets
to be sent to Miss Kane on the even
ing following and left his card to ac
company them.
When Beryl Kane was dressing for
the concert, a box from the florist's
was brought to her- A little thrill of
pleasure went through her as she lifted

as she took her seat besides Miss Kane.
"I must tell you what he said about
you. He said you were music mad and
you didn't care for him because he
wasn't musical and he could never get
into your circle, and I told him to jump
in."
Beryl listened to this voluble confi
dence with the feeling; that she ought to
check or reprove the little tale-bearer,
but she didn't. She felt still another
little thrill, and thought what a lovely
night it waS. If only Louise would do
her best!
Louise did. She came out upon the
stage, clad in the white robes of a chor
ister, her fair, childish face brilliant
with excitement and expectancy. Her
eager, searching eyes caught sight of
Bradley in one of the boxes. She flushed
happily, while the dimples came and
went. The prelude to her number
ended, Bradley, the crowd, every one
vanished from her thoughts. She for
got herself in the grand music of the
"Aye Maria," and she surpassed in its
delivery the highest hopes of her
teacher.
Then followed a wild ecstacy of ap
plause from an enthusiastic audience,
and she reappeared, this time attired
in a pretty white frock. She sang
"Home, Sweet Home" into the hearts
of her hearers. Applause, calls, re
calls and flowers followed.
When the excitement had subsided
and the next number was on, Bradley
found his way behind the scenes.

to the happy little girl, "whew you are

I gave you your first flowers."

So great has the influence of physical
culture been extended that it has be
come part and parcel of the curriculum
not only of the greater and lesser of
our celebrated universities of learning
but It haa found its way into the public
school training system of our younger
generation. I could not but feel
much gratification when I read recertly
of the innovation which has been intro
duced at the University of Pennsyl

R. Tait McKenzie. Not content with
making some form of athletics compul

every student who takes the gymnastic
course must also learn to swim a re
quired distance of so many yards be
fore his course is finished. If a pro
vision of this kind could be made and
enforced everywhere, it would result

of saving so many lives each year

"Then my ambition is satisfied, mu

recognized as a successful teacher."
"And have you any ambitions other
than music?"
"Why, of course!" she laughed.
"Music is only a part of my life."
"Every one has an aim," said Louise
precociously. "Mine is to be a prima

"To make a scoop," replied Beryl.
"That Is only a 'part of my life,'"
he quoted. "I have anotherâa great

"What is it?" asked Louise art

"I am going to tell Miss Kane some

tell you."
Some one called Louise away Just
then.
"May I come and see you soonâ

asked in vibrant voice.
"Yea," she replied softly, screening
her face with the violets.
"I always thought you were bored by

"And I always thought," she retorted,
"that you were bored by people who

"You were mistaken."
"So were you."
Louise ran to them.
"Our carriage is here, Miss Kane. Are

"Certainly not," replied Bradley
quickly. "Prima donnaa always have a

force and faithfully carry out the sys
tem that such a course of training re
quires. Perhaps I may be wrong, but
in my own estimation I am convinced
that the overwhelming victories of the
Japanese soldier in his present conflicts
with the army of the Russian empire
are but further examples of what a
perfect system of training will accom
plish. The Japanese soldier has shown
his vastly superior powers of physical
endurance on many an occasion since
the beginning of the war. He can
march all day and do battle that same
night; he can fight all day and march
that same night. The reason for this
to me seems very clear; It is neither ra
cial nor temperamental but physiologi
cal. The Japanese as a nation eat
sparingly and of food that nourishes
the body without overtaxing the organs
of digestion. Above all they are ex
perts in the art of taking regular
breathing exercises, and they keep their
bodies in such perfect physical condi
tion that every nerve and muscle is <n
use all the time, thus becoming so
thoroughly trained that when a slight
extra pressure is put upon It it doÂ«.s
not collapse.

LOVE OF LORIvS
By Martha McCullocH Williams.
*X y O man is stronger than destiny;
#\| if Helstone could possibly
I \ have helped it he would never
V * have fallen under Loris Gor-
don's spell.
There was no reason whatever for
it, and many very' excellent reasons
ag-ainst it. The chief reason wore a
cap and spectacles, was-of sound mind
and memory, with a. pretty penny to
dispose of, and an undying hatred for
all the Gordon name.
Helstone himself had next to noth
ing:, except loving memories of a
spendthrift father. Miss Marcia Hel
stone, his father's sister had wel
comed the repentant prodigal with
open arms, cherished and tended him
all.his life, and after his death kept
his memory green.
Indeed, there lay the chief root of
her hatred for the Gordons. If an el
der Loris Gordon had not played
him fast and loose, he might never
have gone wandering to and fro, and
roaming up and . down. Though he
had ended by marrying a wife much
more to his sister's mind, she sor
rowed savagely over his frustrated
career. Miss Marcia, as ambitious as
she was illogical, laid at the Gordon
door his wasted opportunity.
It waa the "Christmasing" that had
done it. They had met among the
poor. How was poor Miss Marcia,
who did not go "Christmasing" to
know that Loris' smile was enchant
ing, and set the most delightful dim
ples at play in her cheeks? Or how
should she guess at something strong
er, more mysterious, something quite
transcending beauty, that suddenly
shone out of the girl's eyes, warming,
irradiating John Helstone's heart?
John Helstone was brave and above
board. Before he spoke to Loris he had
it out with his aunt. "I owe you every
thingâyou have been father, mother
and fairy godmother all in one," he
said. "I would do anything you badeâ
except try to live without Lorisâ"
"Suppose she won't have you? I
hardly think you'll kill yourself," Miss
Marcia interrupted sarcastically. Hel
stone laughedâwith a hard breath un
der it âand answered: "If she says 'No,'
I shall keep asking and asking. I am
not vain enough to think she cares
much for meâyet, but if she will let me
teach herâ"
"How romantic we are!" Miss Marcia
said, pursing her lips, then she burst
out: "Let you teach*er! Lord! Lord!
âwhen she has been setting her cap at
you shamelessly ever since the Christ
mas eve party. If I had dreamed what
was to come of it I'd have given them
twice the money they made for their
rubbishy tree to let it alone. But that
is neither here nor thereâyour mind is
made up, I suppose."
"Quite!" John said, whitening: a little.
Miss Marcia glared at him.
"Will you wait three months If I
promise to try liking the girl?" Miss
Marcia asked with a gulp.
Heistone gave her a hearty hug.
"With all the good will in the world."
"I will honestly try to get over my
prejudice, if you will go awayâat once.
Go Westâl want you to look after my
mining lands. I'm sure the agent is a
scoundrel. See that you bring him up
roundly when you get there."
John left that very night. Loris
Gordon turned a little pale when she
heard the news, but said nothing, not
even to her mother. Next week Mar
bury had the sensation of its history.
Miss Marcia drove affably to Gray-
Gordon, the home of her dearest
enemies, and begged that Loris might
come and stay with her while she was
alone at Right Ways. Mrs. Gordon
heard her in a daze, but after a while
agreed to let her daughter go. She
had not been blind to the light in John
Helstone's eyes and fancied she knew
what was under the cards.
At that stage of the game it is a
question if Miss Marcia herself knew.
SomÂ« way, some how, she would de
liver John from the snare of this
fowler. Loris had all the world where
from to choose her lovers Miss
Marcia this one living creature of her
own blood.
Loris was proud and shy. John had
gone away silent. So she kept well to
herself, for the most part, although
she read to Miss Marcia and dutifully
drove with her all the fine afternoons,
to say nothing of playing the three
possible to her from a physical point
of view. The whole scheme is so sim
ple that there remains no possible ex
cuse save carelessness or what is even
worse, laziness. In a few words, un
compromising cleanliness, plenty of
fresh air and healthful exercise with
sufficient sleep will work wonders. This
of course would be the advice of every
good physician. It is not always pleas
ant for an ease-loving woman to rise
moderately early, bathe thoroughly, eat
a light breakfast and walk four or five
miles, not saunteringly, but at a brisk
pace. It is much more to her liking
to rise at a very late hour, eat unspar
ingly, drive out in the afternoon, pass
the balance of her waking hours in a
vitiated atmosphere, perhaps indulging
in positive dissipation. The result of
this mode of living is obvious. I firmly
believe that not one woman In a hun
dred takes the proper amount of exer
cise and a like proportion are wholly
neglectful of the bath. It Is not hard
then to understand, for the solution is
simple enough, that undor these con
ditions good health is impossible. In
conclusion let me that it is the
duty of every woman to make herself
as attractive as her physical attributes
will permit and In every case it is pos
sible. In a greater or less degree. Fol*
low a simple system of exercise regu
larly and you will be surprised at the
result. Rise early, take cold baths, deep
breathing exercises, but above all
things cultivate the fresh air habit,
for remember, oxygen is a food.
games of chess required to put the
elder lady in proper state for sleep.
ShÂ»? also, as in duty bound, exclaimed
over the Helstone diamonds when Miss
Marcia exhibited them. But it took
her aback to have .Miss Marcia say
abruptly after a month of all this: "If
John marries to please me his wife
will be fortunate. If he does not,
everything goes to charity. If it should
go I wonder would you be sorry for
him."
"It would depend," Lords said, flush
ing faintly. "Very sorryâunless ha
got something he cared more about."
"H âm! I fancy you think he cares
more forâyou,'" Miss Marcia said
pointedly. "He thinks so. tooâthat is
why you are here. I brought you to
let you see that you don't fit in.
You would only make' him miserable
âeven more miserable than you
would make me. I hope you are sen
sible enough to see what Is best. I
will give you $10,000 the day you
marryâsome other man than my
nephew, Dr. Hickson, sayâl'm sure
he is wild about you. Marry him be
fore John comes home."
"Thank you for nothing. I don't
want either your money or your
nephew," Loris said haughtily, her
face scarlet. She turned to go, with a
gesture of farewell.
Miss Marcia stopped her by saying:
fretfully: "You must not think of
leavingâsee how it storms outsideâ
the worst March sleet I ever saw. And
If you really don't want John there la
no reason why we should not be good
friends. Stay with me. I wii. make It
worth your while."
"You cannot," Lorls Bald, running;
up to her own room, there to rage and
chafe until she went punctiliously
down to dinner. There waa no gat
ing home until the weather changed.
The walks were glare ice; the paths
drifted. She was a prisoner until morn
ing at least; as a prisoner it behooved
her to show herself brave. Therefore,
instead of sulking through dinner sho
was gayer than she had ever been, and
after it sang of her own notion the old.
old ballads Miss Marcia loved. The
bravery appealed to Miss Marcia won
derfully.
But after her clear "Good night"
Loris did not sleep. Instead she lay
with her head locked In her hands,
quivaring in every fiber.
Had she liberty to come- between
John Helstone and this fine Inheri
tance? She knew the old storyâthe
feud begun in troth plight and troth
breaking. She loved Johnâoh, how
dearlyâbut could she really make up
to him for what he would lose? Miss
Marcia's case, too, appealed to her
strangelyâshe was old and lonely.
Then under this soft mood there crept
a fiery one. John was hjer loverâhers
âMiss Marcia had shamed and insult
ed her. It would be a darling ven
geance to smile at her and say: "Let
the money go in charity, Aunt Marcia;
we can take care of ourselves."
Loris began suddenly to stifle. She
sprang up and started to a window,
but could not open it. Gasping, she
flew to the door, opened it and saw
flame and smoke below. All the big
hall was like a furnace, with the ser
vants asleep in the south wing, and
Miss Marcia snoring and unconscious
across the corridor.
In a minute Loris had her door
open and shut, and was dragging her
from bed toward the east window.
It gave on a piazza roof, whence
escape might be possible. Loris saw
Instantly it was easily possible to her
with strength, yet Miss Marcia moaned
and prayed and hid her eyes. Like
lightning Loris thought of what the
elder woman meant to her own fu
ture. If she were out of the way?
With sudden hatred of self and super
human strength she clutched and
tugged and strained, and at last got
Miss Marcia on the roof. Then Loris
dropped down and called to men run
ning wildly about: "A ladder! A lad
der! Save Miss Helstone!" And then
she sat down, suddenly faint, while
strong and willing arms completed the
work of rescue.
Miss Marcia never did things half
way. As soon as she could sit up she
caught Loris' hand, saying through
tears: "Forgive me! Oh, do forgive
me! I had Insulted you, but you didn't
leave me to burn alive! Youâyou are
âthe wife for John."
"I have thought so all the time,"
said Loris, hiding her happy face in
Miss Marcia's- breast.

OX the 12th of September, 1739,
An- fates rule the desti
nies of the New World oer-<
iniltcd their divinely Imagined
Scheme to find execution at the hands
ot human agents. Upon the Plains of
â¢Abraham, feeder the shoulder of the
fortress of Quebec, ten thousand men
at armsâa paltry numberâfought for
seven hours, and at the end the will of
the f&ios was tccotnplished. America
was henceforth the laud of the English,
and the French had no further place
'in the affairs of the continent.
The story of the Canadian wars, of
the tlege of Quebec, the heroism of
Montcalm and the intrepid bravery of
Wolfe, has been told many times. Many
'Authorities have brought their individ
ual Interpretations of facts and their
deductions from lack of facts to bear
npon the subject, and many have been
the contradictions and wordy disoutes
over irreconcilable differences. I be
lieve, however, that in Major William
'.Wood s book, "The Fight for Canada.'"
Just published, the first really authori
tative, and trustworthy account of the
â¢last days of France's colony in the New
â¢.World has been written. Lack of ac
cess to sources only recently made
available has been the cause of a ereat
ileal uf conjecturing and blundering on
;he part of those who have come be
. fare with histories of the siege and fall
of the Canadian stronghold. Because
of the fact that A. G. Doughty of Que
bec has collected from various sources
'the' letters and orders bearing upon the
events of the time, most of them here
tofore overlooked by historians., the
author at this book is enabled to base
his - entire story upon sources whose
authenticity Is unquestioned. Six vol
â¢ umes of Mr. Doughty's letters and dis
' patches have already been published.
and the entire mass of material is not
yet digested. To these six volumes
Major Wood makes frank and free
acknowledgment of debt for the fact 3
he 6ets forth in his story of the dra
matic last days of Quebec.
The author of "The Fight for Can
ada" has given his book added dis
tinction by the novel viewpoint taken
by him upon the co-ordination be
tween army and navy in the Quebec
maneuvers. For the first time the sea
power is given its proper relation to
the land forces in the annals of the
conquest of Canada. He establishes his
premise thus:*
"The command of the sea must al
ways be taken into account first of all,
â when considering either the whole or
any part of the struggle for dominion
In the New World. It was. Indeed, the
great and unvarying factor which de
termined the relative strength of New
France and New England. Both col
onies owed their birth to the sea, and
depended In every way on the sea.
And the ultimate result of every con
flict between them, even if fought out
in the remotest inland wilds, was
settled, either for or against the victor,
by the relative fighting force which
their two motherlands then possessed
at sea."
And Indeed Major Wood makes out
c good case for the naval branch of
the service. Throughout the whole of
the great Imperial war between Eng
land and France which had its inter
mittent duration between the years of
1688 and 1815, control of the seas was
the deciding weight In the balance of
ultimate success. In 1692 the naval en
gagement of La Hogue definitely 4
decided England's mastery of the
â¢ world's waterways; from that time
forth the fortunes of the flag of St.
George in India and America no less
than upon the Continent lay In the
standings of the "wooden walls" of
Britain. Wood demonstrates how de
pendent both New England and New"
Fiance were upon the fleets of the
mother countries. The existence of
ships guaranteed mobility in aggressive
action and a constant proximity of the
supply base. Thus it was that when
the French fleet had been swept off
.the western seas and Wolfe's force
from Loulsburg was the one named for
the reduction of Quebec the British
fleet under the three admirals, Saun
ders, Durell and Holmes, acting as
convoy and transports for the army,
made the attack upon tne citadel "an
integral part of a world-wide scheme
of naval strategy; and Wolfe's army
was simply a landing party on a large
scale."
Major Wood's narrative of the actual
siege operations against Quebec and
the final struggle on the Plains of
Abraham has the technical minuteness
of a day-by-day diary. From his vast
documentary sources the writer is en
abled to give in finest detail the scheme
of attacks and counter-attacks, feints
and assaults which finaliy culminated
in the midnight landing of the grena
diers and the morning's battle on the
plains. Wood deprecates the too pop

LIFE
in Sing Sing Prison
â¢Â»T TFE IN SING SING BY NUM
BER 1500" Is the sinister title
Â«â* that appears upon the barrpd
and guled cover of a book recently
published. And a remarkably readable
book is this, not only because of the
Intimate view of prison life that it
gives, but also from the fact that some
of the fallacies of prison reform and
the theories of penology are herein
given an effective coup de grace. An
intelligent and observing man -who had
sinned against society and was forced
to suffer the penalties Imposed by the
social order employed the time of his
durance not unprofitably, as this rec
ord of his observations attests.
There is nothing of the hysterical or
the sensational in this anonymous wri
ter's reviev/ of conditions *at New
York's great prison, nor is there any
attempt to represent the prisoner as one
unduly weighted down by the revenge
ful disapproval of society. Number
1500 merely attempts an unimpassioned
discussion of the faults and merits
of prison methods, seeks to reflect the
prisoner's attitude, toward his life in
confinement, and essays an'analysis of
thÂ© mentality and"'the moral sense of
the average man in stripes. According
to his thinking, there exists in the out
side world a great deal of misconcep
tion on all these points; misconception
fostered by amateur penologists, irre
sponsible newspapers and the mislead
ing statements of prison officers them
selves. "I am not so presumptuous,"
says the writer, "as to range myself
with the people who, having grasped a
theory or two, call themselves penolo
gists; nor have I been able to conceive
a practical plan to be applied in the
management of prisons by which the
convict shall enter tainted to the core
with crime and emerge with a complete
outfit of good citizenship. And yet
something of that kind is the expecta
tion of every group of reformers who
pass on to make room for the next ex
perimental novelty, too much amazed
or disgusted with their failure to look
for the real reason."
One feature of prison management
which No. 1500 emphasizes is that
which the public of this State became
Intimately acquainted a few years back
âgraft. Many are the*attempts to re
form the convict, says the writer, and
'never in his experience have these at
tempts brought any satisfactory frui
tion, this because the wrong man is the
object against which they are leveled?
From the turnkeys up through the
ramifications of officialdom such condi
tions exist that the convict's keeper,
rather, should be made the object of
reformation. Everywhere there exists
an unwritten code of business which
recognizes graft as the legitimate
province of the keepersâand of those
higher In authority even than the keep
ers. Thus does the writer characterize
the Impulse underlying this regime:
"After a man haa been a prison officer
for a little time he loses his perception
of ownership, and particularly of that
which Is owned by the State. He is
not sure whether a thing is his or be
longs to the deDartment, but the in
clination of his belief is that it is his.
If the article considered is small enough
to carry away there is no doubt about
it, it is his; although the fact that it is
not easily removed doesn't affect un-
favorably this decision. There are old
officers in Sing; Sing prison living In
rented houses in the village, which they
have furnished with tables, chairs, bed
steads, cutlery and tinware from the
prison; the soap with which their week
ly washing is done is similarly ob
tained, and the oil which they burn is
obtained in the same way."
Not only does this system of graft
react against the prison finances, but
it i&vadea the ranks of the prisoners
themselves. A guard will bring a cell
inmate the materials for making a pair
of shoes, protect him from detec
tion while he is making the
shoes in his cell after working hours
and then reward him by a little "dope"
(opium) or special favor in the yard.
These distinctions between prisoners
exist, to the detriment of disci
pline and the manifest unfairness to
ward the mass ;f prisoners; '
Number IEOO pricks the bubble of ig
norance concerning the disposition of
the average convict. "It is* generally
thought," says he. "that the inmates of
a prison are a body of lawless men,
whose restraint is a matter of the most
serious physical effort, that they are
always seething with rebellion and
ready to break out in open revolt at the
slightest provocation or at the first mo
ment of relaxed discipline or watchful
ness. ,So far opposed .to the truth is
this that for general orderlinoss, quiet
ness and*docility there isn't a univer
sity in the country that compares fa
vorably with Sing Sing in this respect.
There isn't a tamer man in the world
than the average convict, and his be
havior is good in spite of the conditions
which surround him and not because of
them."
On the subject of prison reform the
absolved wrongdoer who writes this
book owns to no great amount of
optimism. Prison life is not enough
like the life outside the walls to make
any change* in the moral sense of the
prisoners practicable. A thief will not
steal because he cannot, but he will
exercise all of his insinuating arts and
low-browed trickery to ingratiate him
self with his guards and thus win pre
ferment for himself. The ordinary
ways of an honest livelihood are. of
course, closed to the Jailed offender, so
that upon his release he knows no arts
but those which led him originally to
the iron doors. Reform must begin in
the conditions which surround the
nascent criminal, according to the
writer's opinion, in that part of a great
metropolis where lives 4!the submerged
tenth." A prison can stand only as a
deterrent, not as a reformatory.
In '"Life in Sing Sing" a strong per
sonal element enters in the author's
account of the establishment and
growth of the Star of Hope, the prison
newspaper which has gained well mer
ited notoriety. Number 1500 was the
promoter and first editor of the prison
sheet and it was while engaged in the,
work of publishing it that he came into
close and ofttlmes pleasurable intimacy
with other of his fellow prisoners. As
the reader cons the history of the

REALISM
in WHitlock's Book
#
A NOVEL formed in the mold of
realism must be well written
to be anything-. Mere photo
graphic reproduction of life as we
know it, the exact presentation of the
drab things of existenceâthis without
emphasis, without a shading to mark
the significance of things does not
constitute a novel nor does it answer
to the assessment of the realistic
novel. Life that tells a story, life,
however flush with the plane of af
fairs, that points a truth known of
all of us; this is the life that finds
its medium of exemplification in the
writings of the realists. To make
salient this truth and to emphasize
this story even while producing a neg
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
atjve of that life's setting, complete in
every detail, is the task of him who
would be counted in the school of Zola
and De Maupassant. This I feel Brand
Whitlock has done in his last novel,
'The Happy Average."
The casual reader whose literary
pabulum is the lurid historical tale
and the insipid society novel, so called,
will say imn edictely upon completing
the first four or five chapters of this
book: "But what Interest have I In
the humdrum tale of a young man's
very hundrum love affair and
wherein lies the interest in the re
cital of this young man's struggle
for a livelihood?" And to this reader
it would be a difficult task to demon
strate how jn the plain, unvarnished
story of one-or two individuals' plain
lives there lies the essence of a
charm, which derives its potency
from the very familiar aspect it has
for the heart of each of us. You and
I, mayhap, are not given to any great
Introspection and, doubtless, we take
little reckoning of the small things of
our lives which go to make up the
grand total of existence; when we see
these neglected figments of our con
sciousness made manifest before us for
the first time then we realize how
much that we do. subconsciously al
most, has significant bearing upon
the more definite thoughts and ac
tions. We realize this in reading the
record of one life's episode which
Whitlock has transcribed for us in
"The Happy Average."
I Glen Marlev's struggle against the
narrowness of environment which fet
ters his ambition, his immediate de
sires and even the soul itself of him
comes home to the reader as a replica
of experience that has been his at
some time or even now is his. The
young man's sentimentality, his lofty
idealism, the mock heroics of his un
fledged optimismâthings all of us
have knownâare set forth with a true
and steady hand by the author. In
reading of the cloud castles of Marley
and his pledged sweetheart, which
gradually suffer revision of plan and
diminution of foundation until at last
the "happy average" of* existence
seems in itself a blessing, is to read
life as we know itâlife with a lesson
that we have learned or have yet to
learn. Â»

FIGHT
Against Femininity
LIKE the late Prank Norris. Guy
Wetmore Carryl could not live to
see the full fruition of his lit
erary labors. Though this young
writer, whose death occurred about a
year ago, had not the genius that was
Norris', there was in him the making
of a bright story teller, as his
posthumous works have shown. "The
Transgression of Andrew Vane," a re
markable strong story of the Amer
ican colony in Paris, demonstrated
that in serious work Carryl had con
structive ability and telling narrative
power of a high order. The second
novel to be published since his death,
"Far From the Maddening Girls," ex
hibits a rich vein of humor, a bright
sparkle of wit, which, had it been al
lowed to develop, might have proven
to Carryl that in the humorous rather
than the serious lay his metier. Even
though conjecture is but conjecture,
one cannot but distinguish in this lit
tle comedietta of bachelordom what
might have been signs of great prom
ise for future work.
Tticre is very little story to the book.
A young man who has preconceived
nctions concerning the dangerous and
altogether deleterious influence of the
softer sex determines upon converting;
his inheritance into the elements of
respectable bachelorhood, builds,
forthwith, a cozy country home and
installs himself therein with a de
licious sense of security. But the
specter of femininity hunts him even
in his lair. A v&ry sweet and alto
gether wholesome girl rinds it In her
h*art to pity this "uppity" bigot and
in the end not only humiliates him.
but causes him to forsake his ortho
doxy and join the innumerable com
pany of the married folk. The fall
from the pinnacle of s?lf-sufficiency is
terrible as it is complete.
In the drolleries of his narrative lies
the humor of Carryl's book. Though,
unfortunately, the author is wont to
carry '>'- s punning propensities a bit
beyond thf. limit of strain, the reader
is* ready to forgive him this sin be
cause of the sharpness of his epigrams
and the .unexpected turn of his wit.
The following example of Carryl's
trenchant statement of a feminine pe
culiarity is not amiss a3 illustrative of
the pointed humor that is his:
' Whore o man proceeds over the
landscape of logic t like a trained
hound, - ' he observes, "scenting his
way unerringly from a definite hypoth
esis to a definite conclusion, a wo
man's 1 argument reappears at inter
vals, like a porpoisV, at points to
which there his been no such thing
a J the possibility of tracing her pro
gress. Her reason does not go from
step to step, but falls downstairs head
long, touching only the high places;
and always, as I have had occasion to
remark l*Â«Â«fcre, the validity of her de*
auction* is materially impaired by the
intrusion cf the purely personal."
Still, maybe it is not fair to advance
thia as an ezftrnple of Carryl's humor,
since there are those âdemonstrative
pronoun, feminine grender âwho will
acknowledge no humor here.

DEFENSE
of Gen. iLongstreet
IT la indeed a labor of Jove that
Helen D. Longstreet has done in
preparing and publishing the book
"Lee and Longstreet at High Tide,"
at once a vindication and a glori
fication of the memory of her hus
band. It must be remembered that
for his seemingly too sudden ac
ceptance of the new order of
things after the war General Long
street came into bad odor with a great
number of his own people of the South
and incurred enemies who never
ceased from traducing his character
even to the day of his death. Chief
among the weapons they had at hand
was the charge that in the battle of,
Gettysburg Longstreet disobeyed Lee's
"sunrise order" of July 2. thereby de
feating the plans of his superior,
which would have otherwise surety
brought victory to the Confederate
forces. This contention on the part of
Longstreet's ill wishers, revived but
recently in General Gordon's reminis
cences, has led the widow of the late
ly deceased leader to advance In this
book records, letters and other docu
mentary evidence to refute the asper-.
sions so persistently cast upon the
military reputation of her husband.
Major General D. E. Sickles, who
opposed Longstreet in the fighting at
Gettysburg, offers the most conclusive
testimony anent the disputed order of
July 2. In an appreclatory introduc
tion to Mrs. Longstreet's book he thus
explains the situation:
"If he (Longstreet) had attacked in
the morning, as It is said he should
have done, he would have encountered
Buford's division of cavalry, five thou
sand sabres, on his flans, and my
corps would have been in his front as
it was in the afternoon. In a word,
all the troops that opposed Longstreet
In the afternoon, including the Fifth
Army Corps and Caldwell's division of
the Second Corps, would have been
available on the left flank of the Union
army in the morning. Every regi
ment and every battery that flred a
shot in the afternoon was on the field
in the morning, and would have re
sisted an assault in the morning aa
stubbornly as in the afternoon."
In addition to this weight of evl
dence concerning the certain futility
nf Longstrcet's attack, even had it
been ordered at sunrise, Mrs. Long
street adduces documentary proof to
show that in none of Lee's orders was
there mention of the hypothetical "sun
rise order," and furthermore that the
story was set In circulation without
warrant by Dr. Pendleton and others
after Lee's death removed the possi
bility of an authoritative denial.
Besides this matter of a controver
sial nature, which occupies but a third
part of the book, Mrs. Longstreet has
furnished a complete outline of the life
of the famous Confederate leader.
The work he did In the Mexican war
and the active part he played In cam
paigns prior and subsequent to that
of Gettysburg are for her subjects of
Â£< \ oted appreciative effort. Her story
is tinctured with the adoration and
reverence of a wife for a husband who
was as deserving of it all as of the
honor of his people.

TASTE
of Reading Public
OCCASIONALLY the publishers
are willing; to unourden their
editorial consciences of some
of the secrets of the trade and
to pass comment upon the present
taste and possible future demands
of the reading public Of course
they do this with the business-like as*
surance that what they have publish
ed and what they intend to publish
will just suit the finical literary palate,
but then we must remember that the
public is the final judge and that the
promised good things of the publishers
may fly as wide of the mark as the
prognostications made on the future
literary demand. Here are some of
the publishers' prophecies. It will not
be uninstructive to read them and
store them away for future reference.
McCLURE, PHILLIPS & CO.âFic
tion, as usual, comprises the main part
of the books published now and there
seems to be no radical change in either
subject or treatment. As to public taste,
it is our opinion that people go* on
very much as they have been doing
of late years in their choice of reading
matter. There is one new note in the
scale of publications which will be
sounded in 190* and one which is a
response to the tendency of the time,
and that is a book on the movement
to the country. This will appeal par
ticularly to people who live in the
country, and aa country life is becom
ing more ar/S more popular with us
there is every reason to believe that
E. P. Powell's "The Country Home,"
which will be followed by "The Or
chard and the Fruit Garden"' and "The
Vegetable Garden," will form an at
tractive and popular series of practical
books without being too technical for
the intellectual public.
The hook of merit, the book of real
worth, stands just as good a chance to
day as it ever did. The production of
books, especially fiction, has been very
largeâthat is, speaking only of the
number of titles; it has, in fact, been
far above the demand, so that the ten
dency now on the part of publishers is
to bring out fewer books. Last year
our production was 25 per cent less
than the preceding year. Publishers
select- more carefully now.. New books
that promise Interest to the public are
new stories of Sherlock Holmes, a book
of political short stories by Booth
Tarkington, a story of modern business
life by Mrs. Keays, and a book by Mrs.
Cutting. So far as we know, there is
no "dark horse in our list."
D. APPLETQN A CO.âln the choice
of books the public is growing; more
and more discriminating. The tremen
dous selling book is a thing of the past,
unless, of course, some really great
writer should spring up. The time is
ripe for the appearance of such an au
thor, but, as we all know, greatness
doesn't make its appearance when you
are looking for it.
A book we feel confident the Dublio
will read is "With the Heroes of Dixie,"
being the diary of Mary Boykin Ches
nut, who was close to the wife of Jef
ferson Davis. The book deals with the
four years of the Civil War. There is
at present great interest manifested in
literature about the South, and stories
as well as historical books of thie war
are a marked feature of current litera
ture.
A unique book n c are to bring out in
the spring is called "Tuskegee and Its
Peopje," the achievements and ideals,
with autobiographies, of sixteen gradu
uates of the school.
HARPER & BROTHERS. âThere is
a marked tendency toward the publica
tion of more serious books, like his
tory, science andâplease don't laugh
poetry. We shall be doing one his
tory of the United States in one vol
time, which is .in elaborate affair, and
we expect to do ten more volumes,
which means the second section of a
great United States history, the total
of which Is twenty-eight volumes.
In addition to this work we expect
to do a great history of science. The
pecple of the country seom to be
hungry for scientific and serious books
In the line of poetry we might men
tion the fact that we are just com
pleting a collected edition of Swin
burne's poetry, a::d the way people are
taking to it indicates, that good poetry,
so far from being dead, is commer
cially profitable.
In literature we expect to have a
book by Henry James, who'has come
over here to rediscover America, and a
companion work by V/illiam Dean
Howells, who is in England discovering
that country. Of course there will be
the ucual amount of fiction; two
new authors will be brought
forward, one a woman and the
oLher a man, both of whom promise
great originality. We-shall also have
a new novel by Mrs. Thurston, author
of "The Masqueraders." Other writers
who will be read this coming year
are Maurice Hewlett, Mrs. Humphry
Ward. Booth Tarkic*?ton, Hamlin Gar
land, Mary E. Wilkjns and so on.
The life of the average novel is
yearly growing smaller, but any good
book on any subject is bound to be
profitable both to the author and the
publisher. Our publications have aver
aged about the same the iast year as
during any previous year.
MISS JEANETTE GILDER, EDI
TOR OP THE CRITIC.âIt is not an
easy subject to prognosticate upon.
The literary tastes of the public are
singularly fickle and unstable, and any
prophecy, however cautious and con
servative, is quite as likely as not to
be set at naught by the course of
events. It is comparatively safe, how
ever, to predict a few things, and one
of these is the steadily increasing de
cline of the historical novel. The re
action from its phenomenal success of
a few years since is still being felt.
Another thing that may be predicted
with equal safety Is that we will see
still less of the spectacular advertise
ments of books, especially novels. The
publishers are returning to the more
legitimate methods of calling attention
to their wares, and the reform is
Judicious and well chosen, not only for
its ultimate effect upon the book mar
ket, but upon reader and writer as
well. The injudicious booming of every
new book that came along and the in
discriminate hailing of every new au
thor as another Kipling or Jane Austen
or George Eliot was carried to such
an excess that we may look for the ut
most conservatism in the near future.
The effec.t of the reaction will not be
so favorable to the new and untried
author as heretofore. Under conditions
as they have been publishers were
eager to take up almost any book that
came along, trusting to luck and to
spectacular booming. But in the fu
ture individual merit will have a bet
ter showing. There will be a fine field
for new authors and for untried
talents, a fair field and no favors.
THE CENTURY COMPANY.âThe
present year will develop considerable
action and reaction in various direc
tions, but chiefly along the lines of Ac
tion. It will see the eclipse of certain
exaggerated characteristics that have
made for great successes in the past,
but which no longer attract by reason
of the fact that they have been over
done. There will be a healthy re
newal of interest in the historical
novel, and in accordance with this be
lief we open the year with the issue of
a story laid in the times of the Reign
of Terror, "In the Name of Liberty. *
A. El. HOUOHTON of Houghton,
Mifflin & Co.âThe tendency of the
public reading taste will run largely
to biography and to Action. The novel
is, of course, like the poor, always with
us,. and it would be idle to say that
any form of literature la ever likely to
exceed it in popularityâat least for a
long time to come. Â»
Jack London, the author of "Tha
Sea Wolf," just out In book form afr
ter Its serial run, has turned his hand
to play writing;. The drama of tho
Klondike, which he is writing at the
request of Ethel Barrymore. Is found
ed on one of his early stories of the
frozen north, and is said by those
who have read the manuscript to be
full of humor.

animal stories, "Red Hunters and the

Â«
To Relieve the Lowly Sick
the Lifework of the
French Noble.
PARIS, Jan. 14.âEvery weekday
tnorning throughout the year a stylish
automobile spins rapidly through the
narrow overpopulated streets of the
Montmartre district in Paris. The
passers, working men and women, cast
friendly glances after the car, some
times bowing to its occupant.
"It's our little doctor," they say.
. â¢ "Little doctor?" the chance visitor
lo the neighborhood is apt to think.
"He may be a doctor, but I should call
him decidedly large and stout." Then
one remembers the meaning of endear
ment that the word little may convey
in France, where children, when they
wish to be particularly affectionate,
epeak of their "little father" and "little
mother."
The man in the automobile is an idol
of the Montmartre populace, and the
reasons for this adoration could be
given by any one you might stop, pro
vided he were poor and unhappy.
"Who is he?" will come the answer.
"He is Monsieur the Barop de Roths
child, who takes care of our wives and
children, and who has built a hospital
on purpose for us. Go up in the Rue
Marcadet and you will see." And
there, indeed, you will see the results
of a work which should stand as a
model for the millionaire philanthro
pists of all nations.
USES WEALTH FOR POOR.
It is not often that a member of a
family world-famous for wealth comes
to earn the genuine affection of the
poor. The secret resentment cherished
by those suffering from all the ills of
.he flesh against those who know no
privation is apt to overrule sentiments
of gratitude even for great services
rendered. By this work among the
lower classes, the Baron Henri de
Rothschild has really come to be one of
the most sincerely beloved men In the
French capital. Remarkable as this
result is, he has attained it by means
more remarkable yet.
Before he was 20 years of age he de
cided that ordinary means for helping
the poorâcontributing to charities, giv
ing alms, distributing soup tickets â
were insufficient and even inefficient.
He saw that diseases of all kindp, re
sulting from improper nourishment and
deplorable conditions of existence, re
quired the most Immediate attention.
He saw wretched babies condemned
from the very beginning of life by
â¢ hereditary or* acquired taints. And he
dreamed of helping to raise humanity
by relieving these sufferings. Contented
with the wealth which he had, refusing
to go into business like the rest of his
family, the Baron Henri de Rothschild
studied medicine with the intention of
practicing among the poor only.
Graduating at the early age of 22
years, the Baron started in at once on
his career. But he found serious obsta
cles in his way. At the public hospitals
he was baffled by the instinctive dread
which the poor have of such institu
tions, and he was regarded suspiciously
as one trying to make experiments on
them. In their homes the breach was
perhaps even wider, and he was, fur
thermore, exposed to calls from im
postors who sought a pretext for levy
ing money. Even where his kindness
was not abused it rarely seemed to
profit. To get into close touch with the
poor and remain so appeared impossi
ble under such conditions.
Then came to the Baron the idea to
which he owes all his success. He de
cided to have a hospital of his own,
where he should see every one who de
sired his medical assistance and give
treatment gratis. Starting quietly with
c modest establishment in the Picpus
district, he soon found the calls upon
him multiplied. The Montmartre poor
attracted his particular attention, and
in their midst he continued his work.
To-day his magnificent private hos
pital in the Rue Marcadet, known as
the Polyclinique H. de Rothschild, has
between 6000 and 7000 persons depend
ent upon it for regular medical attend
ance, without counting the numerous
others who go thither in an emergency.
No less than ten physicians and spe
cialists of all kinds are attached to the
hospital, paid by the Baron to devote
themselves to the service of the poor.
GIVES PERSONAL SERVICES.
Although his Polyclinique has now
been running several years, the ardor
of the Baron is in no way dulled; per
haps it has" rather Increased, for he is
beginning to see the beneficial results
arising from it. Every day from 10
a. m. until noon, he-is at his consulting
room, receiving his patients, examin
ing the notes of his physlcans. and
visiting the inmates of the hospital. It
is perhaps in the consultations that the
Baron takes the keenest interest; for
he has realized that It is not only In
the extreme cases requiring absolute
quiet and constant care, but more often
in local affections demanding relief
which is rarely obtained, that the
working classes want help. Clad in
the lonj white blouse of a hospital
physician, the Baron walks rapidly
from room to room, questioning the
patients, prescribing, and giving in-
structions to his assistants. Gifts of
medicines always go with the advice;
and in frequent cases, wines, bouillons
and dainties follow.
Hia work done, the Baron strips off
his blouse, jumps into the automobile
awaiting him at the door, and speeds
away, the wealthy Rothschild once
again, to attend to his worldly,duties
or to indulge in his favorite sport, au
tomobiling. And yet, throughout the
day, the memory of his poor seems to
remain with him.
Born rich and having recently in
herited a vast fortune from his aunt,
the Baronne Nathaniel de Rothschild,
the Baron Henri is nevertheless sim
plicity itself in his tastes. In a fine
and magnificently furnished residence
between the British Embassy and the
Palace of the Elysee in the Faubourg
St. Honore, he lives unostentatiously.
Automobiling is perhaps his only ex
travagance. His races with W. K.
Vanderbilt Jr., who is an intimate
friend of his. brought him to fame as a
chauffeur a few years ago. and he has
since run in numerous long-distance
races, generally taking an assumed
name to avoid notoriety. He ran in
the Paris-Vienna race as Doctor Pas
cal, the title of one of Zola's novels.
SPECIAL CAKE FOR BABIES.
The subject which has interested the
Baron most in his professional studies,
and that which he has made the spe
cialty of his hospital, is infantile dis
orders. Welcome as are all the suf
fering poor, a mother bringing a sick
baby is always given a particularly
warm greeting. In fact, the Baron
takes this department so deeply to
heart, and is so convinced that through
it a vast service can be rendered to
coming generations, that he goes to the
point of offering rewards to mothers
for bringing their babies regularly to
be inspected. Every baby on the hos
pital lists is supposed to be presented
each Wednesday to be weighed, and
the mothers who have observed this
regulation receive gifts of provisions
which encourage them to continue.
Only when a baby is in perfect health,
which does not happen frequently ow
ing to the deplorable conditions of ex
istence for the working classes in the
Montmartre district, is the strict watch
relinquished. Should the state of the
baby grow worse, and should it become
evident that the care of the mother is
inadequate even when helped with ad
vice, medicines are furnished, and if
need be sterilized milk. Then the baby
is taken to the hospital itself. The
Baron only does this - in extreme cases,
for he believes it more useful to teach
mothers to care for their children, and
he often sends out his physicians to
visit children at home and make sure
that the instructions are being fol
lowed.
But when the baby must enter the
hospital he finds everything that can
contribute to his health and happiness.
Thirty beds and incubators, trained
nurses and house physicians, the best
sterilized milk prepared on the prem
ises and such simple medicines as he
can take are there awaiting him. At
no other hospital in Paris are such ac
commodations offered for babies under
a year old. In fact, infants are re
fused admittance to all the city hos
pitals save the maternity hospitals,
and even there they are supposed to be
accompanied by ill mothers.
EYE PICTURES THE LATEST
FAD IN GREAT BRITAIN
Queen Alexandra Victim of Craze and
Has a Painting of Her
Optic Made.
LONDON, Jan. 14.âAs generally
happens, the Christmas season has
been followed by a new fad. This time
it is a picture of the human eye. In
fashionable feminine circles a picture
of one's optic is regarded as the most
acceptable of gifts. These pictures are
painted life size on miniatures and
show the natural color of the iris, the
shade and curl of the eyelashes, the
shape of the eyebrow and form of the
lid. The correct thing is to get them
set in jeweled frames. Not infrequent
ly they are worn as pendants attached
to neck chains.
No two eyesâthat is, two eyes be
longing to different personsâare ever
alike, painters declare, but it must be
acknowledged that when an eye pic
ture is shown the question of its iden
tity is generally determined by a
guessing match.
Queen Alexandra, Princess Henry of
Pless, the Duchess of Westminster and
the Countess of Warwick are among
those who have fallen victims to the
craze and have given orders for eye
pictures. It is really a revival of an
eighteenth century fad. Cosway, the
famous miniaturist, was among the
first to paint the eye alone, and proba
bly the first eye that he painted was
one of the bewitching orbs of Mrs.
Fitzherbert, the reigning court beauty
of her day. It is now one of the treas
ured possessions of the Earl of Portal -
ington.
THE M CALL
DUCHESS ASSISTS
CHURCH ARMY.,
Wife of Marlborough Helps to
Relieve Distress in London.
FRUIT OF SLUMMING TRIP
* .
LONDON. Jan. 14 âTo insure the suc
cess of a charity bazaar in London it is
essential that some fashionable titled
dame should be found to preside over
it. That helps draw the crowd quite as
much as does the desire to benefit the
poor. The higher in the social scale are
the women who thus lend their pres
ence the more are the pursestrings of
visitors relaxed. Therefore the Rev.
Wilson Carlile, head of the Church
Army, was well pleased when he ob
tained the consent of Princess Henry
of Battenberg and the Duchess of. Marl
borough to preside on successive days
over a bazaar for the benefit of the
work to which he devotes his life.
The bazaar proved a success. The
Princess and the Duchess were gracious
and kindly bestowed their smiles with
tactful indiscrimination on both aris
tocratic and plebeian purchasers. That
is all that is expected of these titled
figureheads, and as a rule it is all they
do. In getting the Duchess of Marl
borough to assist. Dr. CarliU- did some
thing more than obtain a drawing
card for the occasion.
When the affair was over she sur
prised Rev. Mr. Carlile by telling him
that she would like to see something
of how the Church Army did its work
among the poor. That was a delicate
way of intimating that she wished to
see how the money that had been
raised was expended, for it is well
known that she is no believer in indis
criminate almsgiving, which saps inde-
pendence and increases pauperism,
THROUGH SLUMS IX AUTO
In one of the Duchess' motor cars
they made the tour of inspection a
few days ago. A strikingly contrast
ed couple they made, seated side by
side, as the automobile threaded its
way through London's crowded thor
oughfares and sordid slums âthe dain
ty looking Duchess clad in furs and
Mr. Carlile, with somewhat worn and
sharpened features, dressed in the
plain, dark blue military garb of the
Church Army, which he wears as
proudly as a crack guardsman does
the King's showiest uniform.
The Duchess saw some sights that
day which gave heY a new insight into
the perplexing problem of London's
poverty âits vastness and hopeless
ness. Outside several of the army's
relief stations she saw bands of hun
dreds of gaunt, hungry, shivering,
wretches patiently waiting their turn
to enter the yards and do their two
hours' task at wood chopping, which
would bring them a meal and a
night's lodging.
She inspected the dormitories and
kitchens and saw cleanliness, economy
and good management working to
gether in perfection. She visited some
of the labor homes, every inmate of
which does work of some sort which
enables him to pay for his board and
lodging, while every effort is made to
help him find steady employment.
CHURCH THAT ATTRACTS.
Finally the Duchess and her guide
visited the minister's church, St. Mary
at-Hill, and the rectory attached to it.
The work that Mr. Carlfle has wrought
here is one of the sights and wonders
of London. The church is one of the
fifty remaining old city churches, forty
nine of which contain far more empty
pews than worshipers on Sundays.
The living was bestowed on Mr. Carlile
as a sinecure to provide him with an
income sufficient for his support while
managing the Church Army. At that
time its congregation had dwindled to
six. It was the most conspicuous ex
ample that could then be cited of what
la called the "scandal of the city
churches." Now it is the one striking
object lesson which shows what may
still be done with these old places of
worship if men of the right stamp be
put in charge of them. At every ser
vice at St. Mary's slumdom more than
fills the pews that were once regarded
as virtually the private property of
wealth and fashion.
Th 3 ample kitchen is devoted to cook-

ing meals for the poor and destitute,
which, however, are invariably earned
before they are eaten. Other apart
ments have been changed into work
rooms of various kinds. What was
once the rectory garden is chiefly taken
up with sheds where at all hours of the
day men ward -off starvation by chop
ping wood.
GIVES A BIG CHECK.
At th<=> various relief stations they
visited Mr. Carlile pointed out to how
at all of them the great principle that
underlies the t'hurch Army's work for
the unemployed is applied. It is self
help. If a man will help himseif the
society will help him, but if he is one
of those who seek merely to be main
tained in idleness by others, the soci
ety, after giving him a fair trial, drops
him. No attempts are made to cram
religion down anybody's throat. No
premiums are placed on mere profes
sions of piety. To save a man for this
world is recognized as the most impor
tant step toward saving him for the
next.
The Church Army fund received a
far bigger check from the Duchess
than Mr. Carlile had ventured to an- ,
tuipate. Nor was that all that came
of their motor car trip. The Duchess
of Marlborough knows that what a
Duchess says In England counts for
0 great deal more than what might be
euunlly well said, or better said, by
some woman who occupies no particu
lar social position/ So she wrote a let
ter to the Horning Post, appealing for
help for the Church Army.
"At this moment," she says, "when
the m-oblem of the unemployed is be
coming more and more urgent and so
lutions, both political and economic,
are being discussed, it would perhaps
be a good time to remind the public of
the work the Church Army is doing
to relieve the prevalent distress. In
the search after more radical meas
ures it would be a pity to forget ex
isting instiutions, and people desiring
to help immediately could do no
kinder act than to assist the Church
Army in giving work to the unem
ployed.
"Surely," she concludes, "such good
work must not be allowed to suffer
for lack of funds. I, therefore, pray
all those who feel disposed to help al
leviate the terrible distress which ex
ists at our very doors to do so through
the medium of the Church Army, for
they have grappled the question in a
practical way and are accomplishing
a work for which there Is the utmost
need."
A good many society people who did
not chance to read her letter have
since found out what is "Consuelo's
latest fad." She is trying to persaude
all of her friends to visit some of the
Church Army's stations. One of her
motor cars Is always at their disposal
for the purpose.
LORD PEMBROKE WILL
ENGAGE IN BUSINESS
Member of the British Peerage Will
Now Operate a Carpet
Factory.
LONDON, Jan. 14.âBusiness is no
longer regarded as discreditable by the
peerage, and the plea of poverty is hot

DEVOTING HIS FORTUNE AND
HIS SERVICEB TO THE POOR.
needed as an excuse for engaging in it.
The wealthy Lord Pembroke, who owns
some 60,000 acres and whose earldom
dates back to 1551, has just taken over
the Wilton carpet factory, which has
been practically closed for some little
time, and intends to operate it on
money-making lines.
There is no doubt of his ability to
make it pay. As Sidney Herbert he was
for twenty years a member of the
House of Commons, and* would prob
ably have had a prominent career In
the popular branch of the Legislature
but for his brother's untimely death in
1896, which brought him his several
titles and estates.
The late Earl made an exciting world
voyage with Dr. G. H. Klngsley. Their
vessel was wrecked on a coral reef In
an outlying part of the scattered Fiji
archipelago, and the adventurous no
bleman and his companion had to stay
some time among the wild natives be
fore they were rescued. The Earl was
V
a very tall man and is still remembered
by the Fljiansâaffectionately, tooâby
the nickname he acquiredâ"Ratu Niu
Langl," the "sky-reaching? cocoanut
tree chief."
PERCEIVES INSANITY
FROM PAINTED PICTURE
Brush of Sargent Reveals More to
Observer Than a View of
â¢the Original.
LONDON, Jan. 14.âSargent, of
course, Is still accounted the greatest
of living portrait painters In London,
but some society women are fighting
shy of his gifted brush because they
say his telltale pictured faces reveal
more to the observant than do the
flesh and blood originals themselves.
A striking instance of this is now much
discussed in fashionable circles-
Sargent painted a portrait of one of
the most popular leaders of the smart
set. Among those'who saw it was a
celebrated alienist, who at once per
ceived something in the portrait which
had entirely escaped his notice on the
few occasions that he had observed the
lady herself. It caused him to inquire
if there was not insanity in the family.
Some friends made a Utile investiga
tion and assured him that they could
discover no evidence of it. Neverthe
less he adhered to his opinion, based
entirely on his study of the portrait,
that there was insanity in the family
somewhere and the taint of it had de
scended to the woman whose good
looks, wit and vivacity had made her
such a general favorite.
Within six months of the finishing of
the portrait it was found necessary to
send her to a private lunatic asylum.

Mau Choose
an Heiress
in America
Plans of Heir of
the Earf of
Hardwicke.
LONDON, Jan. 14.â8y the death of
the bachelor Earl of Hardwicke at 37
the title, which carries with it not an
acre of property, has passed to his
uncle, Captain "Johnnie" Torke, as he
is familiarly known in society, where he
is a very popular figure. His heir is his
eldest son, Charlie Yorke, a young min
ing engineer, who recently returned
from South Africa, and who now
assumes the title of Viscount Royston.
A flutter of excitement has been
caused in the American colony, and
the smart set generally, by the sugges
tion that, following the example of
other impecunious prospective peers,
the Viscount will seek to re-establish
the family's fortune by marrying an
American heiress. The subject of an
American alliance with this ancient
and aristocratic but financially unfor
tunate house is by no means a new
one, for it has been brought up in the
House of Lords itself.
When the late Earl succeeded his
father he was destitute of property,
and of money had little more than the
proverbial shilling. How he set to
work to earn his own living he told In a
frank and manly speech in the upper
House when Lord Rosebery took ex
ception to his appointment as Under
Secretary for India, because he was
engaged in business on the Stock Ex
change. The young Earl intimated that
he might have chosen the easier and
pleasanter way of retrieving his for
tunes by marrying an American heir
ess, but he had chosen rather to work
out his own financial salvation as a
stockbroker. He added that he could
not afford to abandon his business for
the sake of a few years of office.
Despite their poverty the Hardwicke
family has always been a favorite with
royalty, and the new Eari stands well
at court. He is a jolly little sailor
man, 64 years old, with ruddy face and
side whiskers. Although far from
wealthy, he is much better off than his
predecessor. Though a younger son,
he inherited from his father a small
property on the banks of Southampton
water, now all that belongs to the fam
ily of the once enormous Hardwicke
estates, and with his wife, the daughter
of a great Ayrshire laird, he received
money enough to enable him to afford
all the necessities of life and not a few
of its luxuries. There are four sons
and one daughter in the family, and
they all possess histrionic talents of a
high order. Lady Susan is reputed to
be one of the cleverest amateur comedy
actresses in society.18
Upon the occasion of the second
meeting of King Solomon Chapter, O.
E. S., over which Mrs. Ida B. Spence
presided since her recent installation,
there were presented several petitions,
candidates were balloted for and elect
ed and it was decided that the first
initiation of the new term shall be on
the night of the first meeting in Feb
-1 vary. The officers who are to per
form the task are drilling in order to
present the work in all the perfeetness
of the ritual. At the close of the busi
ness there was a programme of enter
tainment, that was enjoyed by the
members and a large number of vis
itors from nearly all of the local chap
ter.
Last week the officers and members
of this chapter paid a surprise visit
to Past Matron Mrs. Jane Dawson at
her home on California street, and as
the invaders of the home brought with
them th<> material for a collation, and
also talent to entertain, a very pleas
ant evening was spent.
The members of King Solomon Chap
ter will have a colonial party in Lyric-
Hall on the night of February 22 and
to this all the friends of the chapter
have been invited. It will be in order to
appear in dress of colonial days. A
prize will be awarded to the best
dressed lady and one to the best
dressed gentleman.
San Francisco Chapter has appoint
ed a committee, with Worthy Patron
H. W. Maass as chairman, to arrange
for a first class musical and literary
entertainment, to be followed by a
dance, en the night of February 23.
On the night of the first Friday in
January Grand Matron Mrs. Dohrman
paid a visit to the chapter in Sacra
mento. She was accompanied by the
grand treasurer. At the close of the
meeting, a very pleasant one, the grand
matron was presented as a remem
brance of the occasion a crystal ca
rafe.
The next session of Golden Gate
Chapter will be an executive one, at
which none\ but members of the chap
ter will be admitted.
Improved Red Men.
At the first council in the Cold Moon
the following were raised up as the
chiefs of Altahmos Tribe No. 87, Im
proved Order of Red Men, by Henry
M. Blankenstein, D. D. G. S., assisted
by Past Sachem Blaisdell: J. H. Fitz
gerald, sachem; Dr. A. C. Nathan,
senior, and T. S. Scott, junor, saga
more; T. Frank Hardy, prophet; F. H.
Seavy and A. Schneider, sannaps; E.
R. M. Armstrong, guard of the wig
wam; B. F. Carman, guard of the for
est (seventeenth term); P. M. Burke,
J. McCaulay, F. Bergstrom and F. H.
Behnsen, warriors, and E. P. Roche,
J. B. Welch and E. M. Arragada,
finance committee. At the close of the
ceremony H. L. Lacoste, the retiring
prophet, was presented by the tribe,
as a token of admiration of his ser
vices, a valuable emblematic jewel of
his rank in the order. Then followed
congratulatory speeches and a colla
tion in the banquet hall. The new
sachem called upon the members to as
sist him and the other chiefs to in
crease the numerical strength of the
tribe to 600 before the close of the cur
rent term.
On the night of the first Saturday in
January Great Pocahontas Annie M.
Bliss paid an official visit to Alfarata
Council No. 10 in the Laurel Hall of
the Shiels building. The team of the
council in costume escorted the great
Pocahontas and attendant great chiefs
into the very artistically decorated
tepee, where they were received with
the honors due their chieftaincy. There
was work in the adoption degree by a
team composed, for the first time in
the reservation of California, of past
Pocahontases and past Powhattans.
The ritualistic work wasfperfect, while
the floor work, which was entirely
new, was warmly commended. Great
Prophetess Minnie Betts, a member of
Alfarata, was the Pocahontas of the
team, and it was stated, under good
for the order, that her rendition of her
part in the work was beyond the ex
pectation of her most sanguine friends
and was as near perfection as possi
ble. The team was brought to its state
of perfection by Wifllam Betts. At the
close of the council Great Keeper of
Wampum Harriet Janes, also a mem
ber of the council, on behalf of the
council, presented the great Pocahon
tas, as a souvenir of the visit, a beau
tiful set of carvers. Then followed the
presentation of flowers to the great
chiefs, and dancing.
The following were raised up as the
chiefs of Kaweah Council by Katie S.
Adams, D. D. G. P., assisted by Past
Great Pocahontas Jennie Weisel, Great
Minnehaha Ida Wheeler, and Past Po
cahontases Emma Wedemeyer, Mina
Thompson, Lizzie Kemnister, George
Wheeler and a full corps of other acting
great chiefs, who all discharged then
respective duties in a most creditable
manner: Mary Baltic, prophetess;
Tina Fosen, Pocahontas; Loretta
Welsh, Wenonah; George E. Souther,
Powhattan; Annie Casey, keeper of
records; May Houston, assistant; Kate
Sheble and Lottie Hamilton, scouts;
Fannie Harris and Gertie Gagin, run
ners; Amelia Baltic and Myrtle Stein,
counselors; John Hennle, James
Thomas, George Kuhlman and E.
Kaughman, warriors; Sadie Cleve,
guard of the tepee; P. Brody, guard of
the forest.
At the council of Manzanita Council
of the Degree of Pocahontas held on
the sixth sleep of the cold moon the
chiefs whose names have already been
published In this department were
raised up in private by Deputy Great
Pocahontas Hattie Beach in the pres
ence of the great Pocahontas, great
keeper of records, Great Trustee Net
tie Libbing, Past Great Pocahontas
Wisell, Past Great Sachem Brandon
and as many members of the order as
could crowd into the council chamber.
The work was well done and at the
close J. J. Bryan, at the request of the
council, presented Frances Conroy, the
retiring prophetess, a handsome jewel
from the council and a ring from mem
bers of her family, then an Indian sil
ver souvenir, spoon to the district dep
uty. Flowers were also presented to
the outgoing and incoming chiefs. This
council has organized a new adoption
team, with Sophronla Thompson as
Pocahontas and William Winter as
Powhattan, and it will endeavor to
surpass the efforts of the previous team
that was directed by Pocahontas Emma
Rice, who is now the prophetess of the
council. Mrs. Emma Widemeyer has
been continued in office as chief of
records, a position which she has tilled
with groat satisfaction to the entire
membership.
Mios Ruby Ryan, for a time second
councilor of Manzanita Council, was
married in the latter part of the hunt
ing moon to Thomas Dlttman of Wyan
dotte Tribe. The young couple have
been extended* the congratulations of
the council.
Order of Pendo.
A new council of the Order of Pendo
will be instituted in this city on Janu
ary 20.
The new officers of Home Council
were installed on the first Wednesday
in January and on assuming their re
spective stations declared that during
the current term "Home will hum."
The officers of Golden Gate Council
were installed in Mission Opera Hall
last week and after the installation
there was a spread and dancing. This
council had a good gain in member
ship last term and at the next meeting
there will be a class of twenty to in
itiate.
The officers of Oakland Council were
installed last week in the presence of
a large number of members of the or
der. A pleasant f cial hour followed
the ceremony.
Miss Lillian E. Tugwell, one of the

Every man with a new idea to a

Shakespeare, Ibsen, D'Annunzioâ
these are the dramatists the players
choose on their "day off." Miss Bates
took two of them this week, Ibsen with
"Hedda Gebler" and Shakespeare in
the Katharine and Petruchio scenes
of "The Taming of the Shrew." For
her Shakespearean adventure Miss
Bates could not have chosen more hap
pilyâor thus it seemed from her per
formance of Katharine. Still, so versa
tile is the actress' art that one might
be forced to the same conclusion if she
essayed âpay a Beatrice âyet the "lus
â¢ ty wench," the vital,* red headed and
blooded Katharine, would seem to be
peculiarly Miss Bates' Shakespearean
affinity.
"It is my creed," the actress said to
me in her chat of a couple of weeks
ago, "that there is only one Katharine,
" and that is Ada Rehan's." Then she
added: "Yet, some day must come
another, as there was another before
hers"âwith here a sigh for the frailty
of the art.
Miss Rehan's Katharine lost to us
there is very much to be grateful for
in Miss Bates'. Indeed there is much
of Miss Rehan's Katharine in Miss
Batesâwithout any derogation of a
truly individual performance. Almost
at times one could have believed Miss
Rehan speaking, particularly in the
drawling scorn of some of the pas
sages. Even the vocal quality by
some deft trick seemed to echo the
Daly Katharine's. Yet one got strong
ly this feeling that it was not because
Miss Bates admires and has deeply
studied the Rehan conception that she
so plays it, but because she herself
feels the part that way. It has so
much more than the conviction of
imitation: it has so strongly the qual
ity of initiative, spontaneity, that one
feels that even had there been no
Rehan. Miss Bates would have played
the part in almost identical fashion.
In all its phases Miss Bates is ade
quate. The tempestuous first scene
was played with amusing fury and
spirit, and at a prestissimo tempo.
Her "This is a man." after Petru
chio's departure, was delightful comedy
in its suggestion of the femininity under
the shrewishness. All through the
performance was most carefully shad
ed. The gradual subsidence into the
more than reasonableness that Pe
truchio imposes, with its ebullitions,
rebellions, amazements and under-cur
rent of merriment by the way,
were all delightfully suggested. Nor
was Miss Bates less charming in
Katharine's final surrender. The spir
ited and graceful reading of the lines
was cause for further pleasure, and
altogether in her Katharine the actress
has added a notable and vital portrait
to her achievements.
The support was uncommonly good,
as was the whole performance. Eugene
Ormonde's Petruchio was virile and
spirited, though wanting perhaps a
good deal on the humorous side. Had
one not known that Shakespeare's Pe
truchio was shrewing it for fun. Mr.
Ormonde's would hardly have given
away the jest. Again, one was very
grateful to the actor for a remarkably
clear, intelligent and even distinguished
leading of the lines. Of the rest George
Wfsfi Is was a capital Baptista, Mr.
particularly engaging as
Biondella, and E. P. Wilks as Grumio
and J. Tuohy as the tailor were both
happily humorous.

â¢ This week Mr. Bishop inaugurates at
the Majestic Theater here and Ye Lib
â¢ erty Playhouse in Oakland what
seem to be an obvious policy of ex
change. One week will be seen here
th r ' Oakland company, and the next the
company we already know so favor
ably from its work at the Majestic.
The Oakland company makes its first
appearance to-morrow evening in "All
the Comforts of a Home," Gillette's
lively farce, and among those to appear
in the play will be Oza Waldrop, Emer
Booth, Maurice Stewart, Lloyd Ingra
ham, W. L. Gleason and Mina Gleason.
The farce will also see the debut of
George Stuart Christie, said to be a
leading juvenile of much promise. The
week after J. H. GHmour will lead in
the cast of "The Bells," and a powerful
performance of the famous Henry Irv
â¢ ing part may be looked for from thib
excellent actor.
The new policy, with its possibility
of two week "runs," should mean much
' to the finish and sureness of the per
formances. Hereafter, also, there are
to be matinees on Thursday, Saturday
and Sunday.

VARIOUS OFFERINGS
AT LOCAL THEATERS
FOR PRESENT WEEK
It is a question only of what opera
one prefers at the Tivoli this grand
opera season âyou cannot go wrong
in the performances. Both the lyric
and dramatic casts have proved them
selves excellent âphenomenal at the
price. Signorina Tettrazzini, the lead
ing lyric soprano, is a star that in a
year from now one will be paying $7
to hear, and not grudging a cent of
it. Signorina Berlendi, the dramatic
soprano, is an excellent actress and
fine singer and, further, eyed and dim
pled most distractingly. Pollacco, as
the two above. Is already a local idol,
and deservedly so. He is a director
of astonishing resource, unlimited
magnetism and inspired musicianship.
Romboli and La Puma, the barytones;
Frosini and Bazelli. tenors, have also
firmly established themselves in local
favor, and there is an admirable or
chestra and an excellent chorus to the
good. Altogether the season is ex
traordinary and those that do not rec
ognize the fact until it is partly gone
will deserve the regret that will be
theirs. , It is to repeat have
never before been such singers, such
a leader at the Tivoli.
The week's repertoire will be as fol
lows: Monday the theater will be
closed to give further opportunities
of rehearsal; Tuesday, Tettrazzini in
"Lucia"; Wednesday and Friday, Ber
lendi in "Manon" (Massenet), and
Thursday, Tettrazzini in "La Travi
ata." The rest of the week is still in
the hands of Pollacco and the gods.
Edna Wallace Hopper in comedy will
be the novelty attraction at the Colum
bia Theater this week. Miss Hopper's
medium is "A Country Mouse," that
has the record of a two seasons' run in
London. It is an English comedy, the
"country mouse" a country girl whose
adventures in the upper rast set form
the staple of the play. The, supporting
company of the tiny comedienne is said
to be exceptionally capable. The com
edy will be preceded every evening by
a curtain-raiser entitled "Captain Jan
uary," dramatized especially for Miss
Hopper by Augustus Barrett from the
book of the name.

MUSIC OF THE PAST
ON THE INSTRUMENTS
OF CENTURIES AGO
SPhe opportunity to prove oneself a
"person of taste" âas they used to say
in Sheridan's dayâwill be ours in hand
some measure next month. It will be
afforded by the Dolmetsch concerts,
which by the interest one takes or does
not take in them one will fÂ»e proved of
or not of the illuminati. Luckily the
fare offered by the Dolmetsches is suffi
ciently inviting to be in itself a temp
tation to any lover of music, its exclu
sive beauty a further bait to the elect.
No musician can afford to miss these
concerts. The programmes consist en
tirely of compositions belonging to the
Give to barrows, trays and pans

On the city's paved street
Let the spouting fountains cool the air
Singing in the sun-baked square.
Let statu?, picture, park and hal!,
Ballad, flag and festival
The past restore and the day adorn
Ani make each morrow a new morn.
'Til the privilege of Art
Thus to play its cheerful part.
Not only is it the privilege of art
but the duty of art "to give to bar
rows, trays and pans grace and glim
mer of romance." It is an essential
of art that it stir emotions and aspira
tions within us, and just in proportion
to the quality and quantity of the art
round about us are we removed from
animalism, and do we grow; for art in
fluences our thoughts, thoughts our
manners, manners our habits, and
habits our characters. Therefore
should art come into close relation
ship with us; we should find it, not
only on our walls, but in and on the
things we handle and use in the pur
suit of our day's work or pleasure.
It is only by insistent contact with
pulseless things that we acquire a
mental or spiritual message from them.
How well the Little Brown Men
know this story! How thoroughly in
bued is the nation with this principle
of art-intimacy!âfor who in all Japan
ever saw a household article or a per
sonal belonging crude and unadorned?
No articl in Japan is simply useful.
It must add to that quality a bit of
decoration. Moreover it must be har
monious, and therein lies the subtle
power of Japanese art in the forma
tion of Japanese character. It is this
harmony that counts the most in the
sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries, played upon the virginals,
the 1 viol da gamba, the harpsichord
and other instruments of the period.
The players are Mr. and Mrs. Arnold
Dolmetsch and Miss Kathleen Salmon.
Miss Salmon further supplying the
vocal illustrations. Contributing to the
illusion of ancientry will also be the
dress of the players, who appear in the
costumes of the time, and by their por
traits are a singularly picturesque trio.
A pic ture of Mr. Dolmetsch I have be
fore me, lute in hand, with lace at
throat and wrists, delicate pointed
beard, hair sweeping freely over the
brow, might have been done by a Van
dyke. Follows here a typical pro
gramme of the Dolmetsches, all taken
from the Shakespeare period. For my
self I am particularly curious to hear
the "O Mistris Myne," wondering
whether in anything more than its
spelling the song is more Shakespearean
than that of Oscar Weil, who has writ
ten enchantingly on the same theme.
But here is the programme*
THE MUSIC OF SHAKESPEARE.
Song, accompanied by the lute, "Willo
Willo," from "Othello." Miss Kathleen
Salmon and Arnold Dolmetsch; "La
Volta," for the virginals, mentioned in
"King Henry V," Arnold Dolmetsch;
"Light o' Love," for two viols and vir
ginals, "The Two Gentlemen of Ve
rona," Arnold Dolmetsch, Mrs. Mabel
Dolmetsch and Miss Kathleen Salmon;
"The Carmen's Whistle," for the vir
ginals, "The Merry Wives of Windsor";
fancy for two viols, Thomas Morley,
"The Merry Wives of Windsor," Ar
nold Dolmetsch and Mrs. Mabel Dol
metsch; "Canaries," for the lute. "All's
Well That Ends Well," Arnold Dol
metsch; two tunes for the treble viol,
accompanied by the virginals, (1) "For
tune" and (2) "Green Sleeves," "The
Merry Wives of Windsor"; two songs
from "The Tempest." accompanied by
the virginals and viola da gamba, (a)
"Full Fathom Five" and (b) "Where
the Bee Sucks," Rob Johnson, C. 1610,
Miss Kathleen Salmon: "Heartsease,"
for the viola da gamba and harpsi
development of character. Now, who
shall gainsay that this very quality
is one of the mighty weapons that has
loosed the hold of the Russians in the
Far East?
â¢ * â¢
So much for our harmonious neigh
bors over the sea! Now, for ourselves!
The desire for sane decoration has
been growing among us for a few years
âa very few, however âtransplanted,
perhaps, from the Land of the Rising
Sun. Applied art has its disciples in
San Francisco who are equipped to
walk hand in hand with the disciples
of the High Art, so called, and who
are fitted academically and sensitively
to rank with the best of the painters
and sculptors.
Among them is Miss Lillian V.
Tobey, whose studio at 424 Pine street
is the nursery of much beautiful work,
wherein the dexterity of the hand
evolves the products of the brain. It
is in leather work that Miss Tobey
specializes, much of which she showed
at the Arts and Crafts exhibit at the
St. Francis.
Another artist who works with other
implements than paints and plaster is
Mrs. Mary Mott-Smith Bird, whose de
velopments in gold and jewelsâeven
precious mineralsâtake high rank 'as
artistic productions.

C. H. Hansen is up to his eyes in

The furor that Schumann-Heink cre
ated here last season seems well on
the way to repetition in the case of
Gadski. In her first concert one found
the rumors of her remarkable develop
ment -iincc her appearance here three
years ago handsomely confirmed. The
second concert gave further token of
the fact, though it was by no means
so happy in either programme or per
formance. At the recital of last Sat
urday, however, one got the Gadski
of the Brunnhllde, the Isolde, of the
last word of the Wagner women.
It hps been my very great pleasure
to have believed highly in the Gadski
possibilities. When she was here with
the Grau company I found her a singer
whose performance, noble though it
was, was short by much of her final
capacities. Yet of the dramatic grip,
the climacteric passion that in her
"Immolation Scene" of-Baturday after
noon sent one shouting to one's
feet T had not dreamed her possessed.
It was an heroic achievementâa song
epic. She capped it, too, with the cry
of the Valkyr maid, as ringing, radi
ant, thrilling as Nordica's own. I don't
know how the rest felt about It, but to
me it was as if one of our infant earth
quakes had landed me in Walhalla.
Yet T do remember swapping hosannas
with the stranger woman next meâ
who greeted me as a long-lost sister.
It is only a big magnetism, a big tem
perament that can so fuse the hearts
of an audience. And Gadski has them.
As with the truly great, one remem
bers only last the technique of Gadski's
work here. In the lieder one is still
sometimes conscious of the conscious
ness of the artist. Yet even then it is
a pleasure to note the beauty of the
mechanism, the attack just and clean
as a bit of beautiful bowing,
the dynamic values weighed as
gold is weighed, the rounded
and polished phrase. The voice
in its lower range has gained both
power and sweetness; it has ap
parently lost somewhat of both in Its
upper tones. Yet that this last is a
temporary condition last Saturday's
concert would seem to argueâthis aft
ernoon's will prove it. The voice has
still the peculiar liquid quality and that
eloquent little trick of becoming a mere
breath of music that characterize the
Gadski organ. Lastly and very pleas
antly, Mme. Gadski is that most agree
able sight to seeâa beautiful, gracious
and beautifully gowned woman.
There will be of Wagner in this
afternoon's programmeâdid I say that
there was to be a last recital at half
past two o'clock at the Alhambra?â
the gentle Elizabeth's prayer, and the
' Liebestod" from "Tristan and Isolde."
The songs are those of Franz, Mozart,
Schumann, Schubert, Jensen, Brahms,
Bohm and Strauss. It is probable that
the audience will be like Schtimann-
Heink's lastâher largest. It should not
be forgotten that in Selmar Meyro
witz Mme. Gadski has an accompanist
phenomenon and that the prices are
popular.

At the fourth evening recital of the
Twentieth Century Club, that takes
place on Tuesday evening next at
Steinway Hall, the "Alexander's Feast"
of Handel will be presented. One al
ways expects something interesting
from the Twentieth Century Club, and
always &ets it. In its service to the
rare, the curious, the ancient beauti
ful in music, the club is as faithful
as are the Dolmetsches. Not that the
new thing is neglected, but it is rather
to the loving revival of forgotten beau
ties that the club directs its attention.
The "Alexander's Feast" is a happy
instance. The work is heard most in
frequently, and is a conspicuously beau,
tiful example of descriptive writing
and of the composer's genius. That it
will be well and thoughtfully done goes
almost without saying, and those for
tunate enough to be able to hear it are
sure of an unusual quality of enjoy
ment.

gives the story precisely as he sees it,
and he sees these men and horses in
the flesh. Therefore he puts them on
canvas in the warm, pulsating flesh,
and you can feel them choking in the
dust the cattle raise as they cover the
trail over the plain.
Of the cattle trail painted by Han
sen, and here reproduced, E. Hough
says in "His Story of the Cowboy":
"It lies like a rope thrown idly on the
ground, abandoned by the hand that
used it. Its strands are unbraided and
have fallen apart, lying loose and for
gotten upon the soil. The wind is blow
ing dust across these disconnected
threads, and the grasses are seeking to
cover them, and the waters have in
places washed them quite away. The
frayed ends are disappearing. Soon
the entire cord will have disappeared.
The long trail of the cattle range will
then be but a memory."
And so it is, although there are many
places where the trail plainly shows,
deeply cut by the feet of millions of
cattle, just like the old buffalo trails,
but soon all will disappear before ad
vancing civilization, the plow and the
harrow. The long trail ran for more
than 2000 miles along the eastern edge
of the Rocky Mountains. It traversed
the vast land of Texas over the Indian
nations, Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska,
Wyoming and Montana, and as far
west as Utah and Nevada, as far east
as Missouri, lowa and even Illinois, and
as far north as the British posses
sions.

KING MACRAE FINDS
NEW USE FOR BAGPIPES
With Their Dulcet Strains Holds His
Sway Over Terra del
Fuegans.
In new kilts and plaid and playing a
pibroch of triumph on his pipes. John
Farquharson Macrae, formerly of Scot
land, but now of Tlerra del Fuego.
strode the gangway of the Oruba at
Liverpool recently, bound once more for
South America. During twenty-two
years, spent for the most part among
the hostile natives of the Land's End
of the Western Continent, John Farau
harson Macrae clung to his pipes as he
clung to his Scottish accent. When he
had no human companion to converse
with, his pibroch resounded over the
waters of the Magellan Straits.
As a youth he left his native heath
for Argentine and reared cattle. After
a few years he found himself in posses
sion of over 500 horses and a couple of
thousand sheep.
These animals he trekked over 2000
miles, with the aid of a compass and
chart, to Southern Patagonia. He wat
ered and fed his flocks and herds by
the way with only five men to assist
him, but at the end of a year of hunger
and thirst and fatigue he found him
self in possession of a fine stretch of
country over 80,000 acres inextent.
After leasing this land for ten years
he sought fresh territory and trekked
over into Tierra del Fuego.
He was the first Briton to penetrate
into the country, and the natives re
sented the intrusion. The tall Aonas
and the stunted Yaghans came in
hordes, attacked his little castle and
lay in wait for him with arrows.
An intrepid rider and an unerring
shot, however, he would ride away con
cealed by the horse's body and shooting
with deadly effect. For several years
he carried his life in his hands, but at
last the savages began to regard him
with such respect and fear that they
chriatened him "Sorto," the native
equivalent for "the devil."
For some years past the Scottish
pioneer has been undisputed monarch
of Tierra del Fuego. where he has
amassed a fortune. It is with the bag
pipes that he rules.âLondon Mail.
Curious Custom of Traveling Women.
The European papers tell of a curious
custom among traveling women. It
appears that the women when staying
at hotels or the like do not care to ex
hibit to the passers along the corrid
ors the exact size of their feet, so they
carefully carry with them a couple of
pairs of tiny, delicate shoes, which, in
stead of the ones they are wearing, they
place outside their doors for the ser
vants to take down and clean. All the
big boot shops in Paris now make a
specialty of this tiny footgear, and a
pair or two form a portion of the trous
seau of every up-to-date bride. Madrid
women are said to have the smallest
feet; Peruvian women come next and
the American girls are a good third. â

dozen or two of the students to her

men with a soul for music naturally
appeal to her more than their less ap

has keen relish for varsity athletics,
too, and goes to all the football games.

â¢ Some wise man has said that society
is made up of the spirit of men. rather
than of their talents. Accepting his
statement as a truth, then have I dis
covered an agreeable definition for Bo
hemianismâa phase of society wherein
both the spirit of men and their talents
compose it. How do you like that, ye
who tread the trails of Bohemia? At
least, it's not a defamation of one of
the blessedest spots we know âa world
of relaxation, joy and a communion of
spirits.
Likewise does Bohemianism suggest a
humanism in pleasure, and an appre
ciation of cleverness. Not all, in Bohe
mia, is gold. Nor is it glitter. Rather is
it cleverness, and a humane interest in
thee and me. And it is these qualities
that are creeping upon San Francisco
societyâand here's to it, and to any
thing that brings spontaneity to its
members!
Undeniably many smart dinners are
dullâdeadly dull; many swagger re
. ceptions are beastly bores, and loads of
teas are excoriations of the spiritâ
and all because the "spirit" of society
wasn't there. But it's a different tale
where the hostessâor the greater part
of the guestsâhave the "spirit.'' Then
things go with a zip! The affairs
where talent abides, as well as the
spirit, are the functions that know no
negative R. 8. V. P.'s. Talent and
spiritâthese are the exponents of Bo
hemianism, and are the mystic quali
ties that envelop successful entertain
ing. But whence come these hand
maidens of social intercourse? Good
friend, from the studios round about
us, from the folk who write and play
' and sing and paint and carveâit is
from these people of imagination and
resultant joy that come the twin god
desses of pleasure, spirit and talent.
And blessings on them!

The efforts of ambitious and persis

have been attended, in the main, with
only indifferent success. Illness has

Plans have crystallized and are near
ing maturity for the production in orig
inal German of the comedy "Frau
Ronigen." The exponents are chosen
from society's ranks and are those who
are by talent and experience well fitted
to portray the roles. The lead will be
assumed by Miss Grace Llewellyn
Jones, who is an impersonator of
charm and grace. Her past delineations
have brought Miss Jones into the recog
nition and remembrance of the public,
for she has been intrusted with lines
requiring intelligence and depth of in
terpretation. "Phedre," in French, was
exceptionally well carried by Miss
Jones in the Greek Theater at Berke
ley, and another noticeable appearance
was that In Mrs. Browning's "In the
Balcony," given at Century Hall not
long ago. Miss Jones' versatility of
tongue led her, too, into a charming
reading of Dante's "Dlvina Comedia."
The requirements of "Frau Ronigth"
will be further upheld by Miss Amy
Porter in the French-speaking part of
Duchess Narbonne; Miss Louise Hol
llry, Duchess Eleonore; Miss Kohnke,
Duchess Fenlse. and Miss Etta Eiben
will play a peasant character requiring
a clever dialect reading. Carl Meier
will carry the leading male role, and
some others of the cast are Bruno
Burkhart, Dr. Broderick, Dr. L K.
Plinez, Dr. Samson and Dr. Paul Wis
mer. The direction and stage manage
ment are under the supervision of Ar
thur Becker, whose success with the
Alameda Lustspiel Ensemble has
proved his efficiency in these lines. No
accessory to scenic effect nor costum
ing will be overlooked, and the detailed
observances will genuinely reproduce a
mediaeval "Minnesinger court." The
University of California library will be
awarded the proceeds from this presen
tation.

Miss Irene is a bud of this season and
of the temperament to enjoy everything
intensely. What an enviable disposi
tion, for It is really rare at this day to
see a young girl genuinely enjoy life
with its pleasure contemporaneous
with her youthfulness. Many of the
younger set assume an air of boredom
and others are really victims of ennuL
The latter deserve some comiseration,
for if youth is not fruitful of buoy
ancy, the charm of life Is more than
half gone. The assumption of indiffer
ence to youthful pleasure is a mockery
and should be ridiculed out of exist
ence. The bubbling, ingenuous spirit
of the maid Just entering a realm of
merriment is the most natural thing in
the world and why stifle it? She gives
infinite pleasure to others who expect
and like to see her unrestrained enjoy
ment which oftentimes imparts Itself,
infusing enthusiasm into those older

So good wishes to the maid who en

EARL MAKES BIG PROFIT
FROM SALOONS HE OWNS
Turns on Purity Movement He Sup-
ported to Lease Them to
Brewers.
LONDON, Jan. 14.âThe Earl of Dy
sart has Just furnished a striking ex
ample of the sacrifice of principle to
profit by no means rare in the British
aristocracy. Not long ago he figured
at a meeting in support of Earl Grey's
public house trust movement, which
has for its object the diminution of
the drink evil by making saloons and
taverns less exclusively places for the
sale of intoxicants. The scheme Is
much like that which Bishop Potter
aided in New York. For its success it
is essential that such houses should
not be owned by the large breweries,
whose interests necessarily lie in sell
ing as much beer as possible.
On Lord Dysart's estates are several
licensed public houses which he owns.
Recently he served notice on the occu
pants of the termination of their ten
ancies in April next, but they were
informed that they would be able to
tender for their respective houses on a
twenty-one-year lease. The same priv
ilege was extended to the brewers and
as was anticipated the tenants were
outbid by a local brewery firm, with
the result that each of the "pubs" will
be converted from a "free" to a "tied"
house.
The noble landlord's action has nat
urally aroused much criticism. If his
seat in the House of Lords were an
elective one he would certainly lose it
at the next general election, but as an
hereditary peer he can afford to disre
gard public opinion and pocket his
principles with his profits.
Men claim that women are very de
ceptive, but the latter scarcely ever
have so much to conceal as their lords
and masters.

entered the Columbus Savings and

as it was opened for business. He
went up to F. N. Balgrano, the cash

struggling with him on the sidewalk
when Policeman Bakullch came along

and the handcuffs were soon over the
maniac's wrists.
Angelinetti waa taken to the City

Millionaire Van Alen Se
cures King's Gardener by
Offering Princely Salary
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Jan. 14. âAtÃushtonHall,
the recently acquired country seat of |
James Van Alen, the American mil
lionaire who finds English social con
ditions much more to his liking than
those of his native land, there has
just arrived an army of workmen,
who are going to, pull the old place to
pieces. It will then be reconstructed j
' and enlarged on a scale of lavishness
and splendor commensurate with the
owner's purse and the prominence he I
expects to attain as an English coun
try squire. Never before has such ac- L
tivity been witnessed in the quaint
little Northamptonshire town of Ket- !
tering, which is about three miles dis
tant from the hall. Lodgings are at a
premium and what the tradespeople
have lost from lack of employment
during a hard winter they hope to
make up through the liberal expendi
ture of the new master of Rushton.
Van Alen has just made a most im
portant appointment one, too,
that will be much welcomed in the
neighborhood. James Cruickshank
had been head gardener at the hall
for many years, but when the place
was sold recently he had to look for
other employment and as it was un- \
derstood that an entirely new staff
was to do duty at Rushton Hall, h
Cruickshank had no hope of being re- |
engaged there. He had earned a high
reputation as a gardener in the ser
vices of King Edward, the Duke of !
Connaught and the Rothschilds, and
without difficulty procured another
position at Windsor Castle. This Van
Alen induced him to relinquish by the
offer of a princely salary, and he has
now returned to Rushton Hall. It is
understood that his salary is higher
than that of any other head gardener
fn England. He has already received
his instructions. The old hothouses
are to be demolished and new ter- j
races and walks after sixteenth cen
tury style are to be constructed, plans
I for which have been supplied by Mr. j
I Van Alen himself.
Miss Van Alen, with a party of
' friends, has been over the old house
1 and grounds exploring every nook and
corner. The whole scheme of decora
! tion will be left entirely to her tastes.
It is believed that she was mainly in
: strumental in securing the services of
; the gardener, being much impressed
; by what she saw of his work when she
I went over the grounds in the neigh- i
borhood of the hall.

I the successful litigant to pay her

Rooney thought he had suffered
; about $5000 worth of damages ac-
I cording to his complaint. He asserted
that the foundations of his house had
been rent asunder; that his yard had j
been made a dumping ground for de- |
bris, and that his feelings had suf
fered several thousand dollars' worth {
of rude shocks.
The lower court decided in his fa- {
vor and the higher tribunal affirms
that decision. The defendants are not

From testimony taken in the inves

struck bottom near the Black Spar
Buoy No. 1, which marks the sub

and disabling her engines; the vessel
backed into deeper water and anchor
ed. The tug Ranger came to the
assistance of the Lamke, but soon
after slipping the ancher the towing
hawser parted and the Lakme drifted
out over the South Shoal, striking
heavily on the bottom; the vessel
leaked badly and became waterlogged.
After the Lakme was outside the bar
the tug Ranger took the crew off.
Afterward the steamer North Fork
took the Lakme in tow for San Fran
cisco and was relieved by the tug Sea
Rover.
From the evidence we find that the
Black Spar Buoy No. 1 had shifted
southward out into the channel from
its proper position, and that the South
Shoal had made out more into the
channel toward the north since the
Lakme arrived at Eureka.
After a careful consideration of
the evidence, we exonerate J. W. Carl
son, master and pilot of the steamer
Lakme, from blame in connection
therewith.
Vessels Turn Back.
The bar was very rough all day yes
terday, and only those vessels running
on a strict schedule ventured out to sea.
The schooner Charles E. Falk. bound
for Grays Harbor, started for the
heads, but one. good look at the trour
bled waters that filled the Golden Gate
was enough to cause the schooner to
turn back. The United States cruiser
Buffalo, bound out for a cruise, also
turned tall at the sight of the breakers,
and will remain in port until the bar
resumes its accustomed placid mOod.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
JOHN D. SPRECKELS Proprietor
ADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO
JOHN McNAUGHT .Manager
PUBLICATION 0FF1CE.....". THIRD AND MARKET STREETS. SAN FRANCISCO
SUNDAY JANUARYJ6, 1905
PRESIDENT HARPER of Chicago University has joined the
great throng of scholars who favor mankind with their opinion
about man. Dr. Harper announces the opinion that men are
naturally untrustworthy. Bringing it down to cases, he told the
student audience that was before him that not more than 20 per
cent of them are entirely and fully responsible and trustworthy at
all times.
This has caused a general protest. Men are surprised to learn
that they are not trustworthy. Yet there is truth in Dr. Harper's
conclusion. The poets are men of insight into the mental and moral
wheels that move us, and they are quite agreed on the proposition
that men are uncertain. The students in Dr. Harper's audience
should rather feel flattered than offended that he conceded that 20
per cent of them will stand without hitching.
The uncertainty about a man's action inheres in his self-interest.
Even pious preachers, of great fervor and undoubted usefulness in
the ministry, will suppress important facts about the character and
habits, the defects in wind, limb and bottom of a horse, in the pleas
ant excitement of a horse trade. Many a man has lived to lament
that whereas he intended to "do" a man of God in a horse trade, he
has issued from the transaction well "done" himself. In view of this
human peculiarity Robert Burns wrote of his brother men as an
"unco squad, and little to be trusted. When self the wavering bal
ance shape, 'tis rarely right adjusted." There is a certain keenness
and ingenuity and edge that men will bring into business that must
be considered, met and offset by the same equipment, in order to
preserve a medium of results that balances losses.
In old New York the greatest Quaker merchant was Jacob Bar
ker. He sat under the preaching of Elias Hicks and clad ,himself in
shad belly coat, barn door trousers and a broad brim, and was a
good man. One of his ships from Calcutta was long overdue and
he applied for reinsurance at a high premium. Next morning he was
early on the docks and met a common sailor whom he learned
that his ship and cargo had gone down in the Indian Ocean. He
thereupon sent a note to the underwriter saying, "Thee need not
issue that policy. I have heard from the ship." Immediately the
policy was written up and a demand made for the premium. After
much contention and the beginning of a lawsuit to make hini take
the policy, Jacob submitted and paid the premium. That was in
the long ago. There were no telegraphs nor steamships, and it was
months before it became known that the ship was lost, and then the
underwriter wanted to go into court to evade the payment of the
policy, but Jacob had him tight and fast. Now that underwriter no
doubt regarded Jacob as untrustworthy. He was certainly ingenious
and had a deep knowledge of the nature of man and the part that
avarice has among his motives. Still Jacob told the truth, he had
heard from the ship.
These evidential facts about the perversity of man when his self
interests are involved should not unduly cast us down. Not all men
are uncertain. The Chinese of all classes are scrupulous about their
contracts. They are noted for strict performance of a contract even
at a loss. Yet our yellow brethren, instructed by the philosophy of
Confucius and admirable in many ways, when they make a contract
are as deep and profound students of the tactics of self-interest and
advantage as any Christian that ever drove bargain. But. to their
honor be it said, the chiseling stops when the contract is made, and
they perform scrupulously, therein differing from their Christian
brethren, who are apt to be honest in making contracts but dishonest
in their performance.
Seriously, Dr. Harper is right in saying that to keep us up to a
proper moral pace we need the support of something outside our
selves. This has been man's need in all ages, and will be his need
world without end. This need has caused the framing of all systems
of morals and philosophy, of all religion and theology. Since the
morning stars sang together man has been balky, and when the
.stellar vocalists make their farewell tour some men will be found
fVefusing to pull. It is this uncertainty that has made of all theologies
axnd systems of religion a network of rewards and punishments.
Man, childlike, will do right if he is paid for it, and will avoid wrong
in fear of punishment. Whenever some Dr. Harper of the future
can announce positively that men are doing right because it is right;
and not in the hope of reward, nor the fear of punishment, then the
millennium will be upon the world and it will be safe to trade
horses even with a preacher.
THE State University has been intrusted by the Department of
Agriculture with the making of tests to develop the value of
fruit as a diet. Fruit eating is treated as the consumption of an
article that does not tax digestion, to extract from it nutriment for
the body. It is widely considered in the same class as the use of
condiments, which give zest to food, but add nothing to its nutritive
value. It is this idea that puts fruit among the luxuries and not the
â¢necessaries of a diet.
Obviously it is to the interest of California, the greatest fruit re
gion in the world, to demonstrate that while its flavors which charm
the palate are luxurious, still, fruit is of solid value as a nutriment.
Such a demonstration develops the economy of fruit consumption as
a means of maintaining physical health and strength. It has been
believed that fruit as part of a mixed diet serves to aid digestion
and thereby secure better assimilation of other food. The experi
ments at Berkeley go further than this. They prove that fruit has
a food value of its own. and that it serves not only a useful office in
promoting the assimilation of other foods, but has its part in the
elimination of waste and the building of new tissue to take its place.
The recent investigations of food values by the Agricultural
Department have a very important economic bearing. When the
people know the constituents of a diet that best maintains the bodily
strength and balance, they can effect a great saving in the cost of
diet, and by eliminating those food articles which add nothing to
their strength, but serve to impair rather than reinforce it, health
is promoted and the cost and loss of sickness are saved.
The Japanese have taught us valuable and important lessons in
diet, and have shown how important a fit diet is to conserve national
strength. It goes without saying that a nation of dyspeptics and
anaemics is not the equal of a nation of the same population of stout,
full-blooded and healthy men and women. In war or commerce the
nation of healthy people has a distinct advantage. In production,
enterprise and strenuous achievement, one man in such a nation is
equal to four or five men in a nation whose people are underfed or
who consume a diet that is unfit. For these reasons the diet investi
gations now going on here are of vast economic importance, and the
experiments in fruit eating are of special value to California. They
will place our fruit growers in the ranks of food and nutriment pro
ducers, whose product is of equal importance with that of the meat,
and cereal producer. mm^mmmmmmmmmmmmm
THE NEW CUSTOM-HOUSE.
WHEN our Senators and Representatives, mindful of the pa
tience and long suffering of San Francisco in the need of
ampler room and better facilities in the Custom-house, se
cured an appropriation for a new and larger building, there was a
feeling of relief in our business community. When plans were
submitted those of our local architects were passed over and one
made in St. Louis was accepted.
Now if San Francisco have anywhere a complete antithesis in
climate and physical conditions it is to be found in St. Louis. Here
all office men who must toil indoors at a desk must have sunshine
and light. In St. Louis it is the reverse. Office men seek the north
side of buildings and avoid the sun in their long'and hot summer.
Our Custom-house plans, made in St, Louis, locate the offices and
CAN MEN BE TRUSTED?
A FRUIT DIET.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 15, 1905.
ftEN PREFER MOTHERLY WO/1EN
ARE most women incapable of a
deep and passionate love? If so,
is it the fault of their natures or
does it result from the fact that
; they do not meet their affinities? These
are among the first questions which it
falls to me to answer in the new year.
There are few of the women whom I
j know who appear to love the men of
! their choice with a degree of dramatic
Intensity which would suit the popular
1 idea of the word "passionate." But each
. one certainly gives to sweetheart or
J husband a romantic affection which is
I exactly as good and great as she her
| self is. And apparently the men are
j satisfied.
Really, when you stop to think it
over, it must be a terrible bore to a
man to have a girl madly in love with
him. It's like barring all the exits at
an entertainment except the fire escape.
I have always understood how Phaon
felt when the nut-brown maid of Les
bos begged of him:
"The vows you never will return re-
ceive ;
And take at least the love you will
not give."
You can't blame a man for dodging
when a Woman flings herself at his
head in that way. Reflex action is ex
planatory enough.
I think the average manâwhom I
am sure 1 have met, although Julian
Hawthorne asserts he exists only in
the imagination of statisticsâneither
expects nof wants complete responsive
ness to his moods from the woman he
is wooing, or has won. He looks for
affection and sympathy from her and
for that light and grateful co
quetry which is potent as "a small
fluttering breeze to coax the roses
open."
He asks for an unswerving loyalty,
which means not only that the Woman
whom he loves is true to him. b it als )
that she has full confidence in his love.
A KOREAN maiden coy was she, whose parents were passing rich t>
A Russian of noble blood was he, with a name that ended in
Her matronymic he couldn't pronounce, so simply called her Dear -
She merrily tried to babble his name, but found it "too awfully queer.
Now every one knows that by Korean law, which cannot be gainsaid,
1 he hubby takes his true wife's name the moment that they are wed.
To them in the course of time were born twin offspring-a girl and boy;
And then a terrible strife arose that clouded the parents'joy,
As to whether the "k's" or the "qs" or the "o's" m the names should predominate,
Or whether the "vitch's or "ski's" or "off's" should determine the children s fate.
There might be two ends to this horrid tale, as you have probably guessed;
I've tried them both, and I'm jiggered quite if I knowwhich is best.
And this is the first: They solved the puzzle by calling them "Bob" and "Sue,"
And lived their lives In connubial bliss in the town of Tungwuan-pu.
And this is the other: The war broke out and the Russ fell fighting his toe,
And the widow and orphans annexed a Jap and reside in Pitsuwo.
desks in the St. Louis and not the San Francisco climate. But that
is not the greatest objection. The plan impairs the administrative
efficiency of the customs force. It throws analogous desks entirely
out of co-ordination, locating them not only inconveniently when
they are on the same floor, but putting them on different floors, where
business now transacted in a few minutes will require tenfold as
much time, and will be transacted with the greatest possible incon
venience.
Nor is that all. The present Custom-house space is on one
floor, 55 feet wide and 125 long. This space is far too small for the
! present volume of business and is daily becoming more inadequate.
: This inadequacy caused the outcry for more space and a larger
building. There was no other practical reason or argument for a
j new building. The demand was heard and heeded when Congress
j ordered the new building. But the plan adopted squeezes the busi
! ness now crowded in a space that is 55 by 125 feet into a space that
iis only 38 by 109 feet! That is to say business that is now crowded
! into 6875 square feet is to be squeezed into 4142 square feet! No
wonder that such a preposterous proposition excites the wonder and
the opposition of business men and Custom-house officers.
In addition to these faults the Sub-Treasury is to be located in
' the new Custom-house, on the second floor, facing Washington
street, to be reached by traversing a corridor 135 feet, then going
up one story by stairs or elevator, then retracing toward Washington
I street 140 feet, and turning at right angles. This protracted passage
j is also the only means of ingress and egress for persons doing busi
ness on the small floor allotted to the Custom-house, to the most
possible inconvenience for them, and those going to the Sub-Treas
ury. The Sub-Treasury should be on the ground floor with an inde
pendent entrance, and not be made an obstruction to the Custom
house.
As these glaring, indeed infuriating, defects affect the transaction
of business unfavorably and impair the administrative efficiency of
the Custom-house, the matter should be decided by the Secretary of
the Treasury and not be left to an architect who has no experience
in the business which is to be housed in the building he has planned.
It is a proper subject to be taken up by the Merchants' Exchange and
the Chamber of Commerce.
STORM CLOUDS IN RUSSIA.
THE salt yarn about rats forsaking a sinking ship would seem
to have application in things beyond the province of nautical
affairs if the recent reports from Ellis Island are considered.
During the last five months,'so the immigration officials report,
75,160 Jews from Russia have sought admission to the United
States at the New York port alone and the constant stream of
the unfortunates from Czar land is swelling with each incoming
steamer. Another significant report upon the waterlogged condi
tion of the Russian ship of state comes from the secret agents of
the Standard Oil Company, who advise that throughout all of the
; southern provinces the spirit of rebellion is seething to the point of
outbreak.
In any European country but Russia an outbreak against the
I domineering bureaucracy would have been precipitated already by
i a crisis such as that in Russian affairs. Now, when the stronghold
i of the East has fallen and the man who conducted the almost super
-1 human defense of the fortress is returning to his own land to face
a court-martial for violating the orders of the Emperor in finally sur
rendering his paltry hanjdful of survivors, it seems that finally the
phlegm of the people is broken and the storm gathers.
Ignoring all signs of approaching danger or dismissing them
â¢ with contemptuous scorn, those at the head of Holy Russia declare
that the war in the East has just begun and that the prestige of
Russian arms must be won back before peace talk is listened to.
This means that the losses sustained in endeavoring to win an
empire on the Pacific must be vindicated at the risk of the state
itself. But the state, which has always represented nothing but the
bureaucracy in the eyes of the ruling class, now suddenly develops
i the ungainly but terribly powerful shape of the bourgeoisie, which
refuses to allow itself to be staked against honor lost by the blunder
ing of the aristocrats. Here is a situation balefully analogous to that
one which tonfronted the old regime in France when 1789 wit
nessed the calling of the States General.

ventions. . And the women who disre
gard these recognized rules of feminine
etiquette come sooner or later to wish
they had not done so.
So far as I can see, no good ever
comes to a woman yet by loving with
out reason or rhyme. Sappho and Dido,
and Heloise, who are three histori-3
types of passionate womanhood, loved
unhappily, every one of them. Of all
of them. Heloise is the only one whom
the world to-day reveres, and this
homage it pays her chiefly because the
self-abnegation of her love was of the
same essence as motherhood. Richard
le Gallienne has expressed this thought
beautifully in his description c-* her
long years of mourning over Abelard's
tomb in the quiet chapel in the lonely
valley of Arduzon.
"As time passed." he writes, "that
vigii must have grown less and less the
vigil of a wife's heartbreak, and more
and more the vigil of a mother over
the sleep of her tired child. For a wom
an's loveâmost of all. perhaps, the love
for her husband."
Professor G. Stanley Hall, after years
of study of feminine psychology, puts
this same estimate on woman's affec
ion. He says:
, "To be a true woman means to be
yet more mother than wife. The Ma
donna conception expresses man's
highest comprehension of woman's real
nature."
Maybe this is the reason why Sap
pho, violet-weaving, most passionate
of loving women, charms our senses
momentarily only by her singing what
SwÂ»nburne says are:
"Songs that move the heart of the
shaken heaven.
Songs that break the heart of the
earth with pity.
Hearing, to hear them."
Her cry, as sweet as bird notes soar
ing skyward, yet is earthborn. It ks
plaintive lamentation of a selflsh sor
row.

STlMULANTSâSubscriber, Oakland,
Cal. It has been laid down in some
tMMiH that stimulants are necessary to
life. One writer says: "The desire for
stimulants is a natural propensity, im- j
planted in man's nature, as is manifest
from the universal tendency to such in- !
dulgences in every nation. From this
it is inferred that it is an innocent de- j
sire, which ought to be gratified to j
some extent and that the aim should
be to keep within the limits of temper
ance instead of a desire to exterminate
a natural propensity. Another argu
ment is that the use of stimulants, such
as wines, alcoholic productions, tea j
and coffee, are recognized by the Crea- i
tor. as they are among the good things
provided for our gratification, but like
all other blessings they are exposed to
abuse and excess."
STREET OR ROADâO. S., City.
Matter involving the question of per
sonal rights, or property rights which
require the application of law to facts,
should be submitted to a reputable at
torney for his advice. This department
does not undertake to give such advice.
It will state what the law is, as it ap
pears in the books, but will not go be
yond that. In the matter of the dedi
cation of a road or street, or road, if
the same has been used for a period
of twenty years by the public as a
thoroughfare with the knowledge of
the owner of the land, then it is pre
sumed that it has been dedicated to the
general public for its use. But the use
of a roadway through lands is a mat
ter of circumstances as to whether it
was intended to be dedicated to the
public, and the assertion that it was
so dedicated is subject to rebuttal by
the party through whose land such
roadway runs
SHORT STORIES OF A\EN
IN THE PUBLIC EYE.
From the Boston Record.
I hear a story of Prince Fushimi and
Justice Holmes of the United States
Supreme Court. When they met in
I Washington the Judge said. Jokingly:
i"I suppose the Emperor sent you over
I here because he was afraid you would
! get killed unless he prevented you from
j fighting any more?"
The famous fighter replied, seriously:
! "Well, in the Chinese war I was really
i apprehensive of getting a bullet, be-
I cause I wanted to live to achieve some
j thing; but now I am ready; I do not
j care; I feel no apprehension."
Dr. Eliot Was Absent Minded.
From the Woman'a Home Companion.
Once when there was a vacancy in
| the Massachusetts bishopric Dr. Phil
'â â  lips Brooks was the most likely candi
â  date. The dean of the Theological
I School in Cambridge, Dr. Lawrence,
during the course of a walk with Dr.
Eliot of Harvard began a discussion of
; the situation.
"Don't you think Brooks will be elect
; ed?" asked he.
"Well, no," said Dr. Eliot; "a second
!or third rate man would do just as well.
'We need Brooks right here in Boston."
Phillips Brooks was elected, and a
! short time thereafter Dr. Eliot and Dr.
Lawrence were again talking of the
; matter.
j "Arefli't you glad Brooks was elect

, "Yes. I suQpose so," replied the ab

SOWING THE BIBLE.
The work of sowing- the Bible
throughout the Turkish empire, from
Constantinople to Bagdad, is beset
with peculiar difficulties. There is, it
seems, a most ridiculous censorship of
the Bible. It is a curious illustration
of prejudice that the "seditious" word
"Macedonia," occurring in the New
Testament, should excite suspicion and
mistrust at the Sublime Porte.
In Armenia, too âto give this group
of Turkish vilayets its common name
âthe distribution of Bibles is espe
cially difficult. And yet that it is
eagerly read by the natives when it
falls into their hands may be gathered
from this story told by one of the
Bible-men. A copy of the Word of
God was given to a patient in the
Armenian Hospital and by him carried
to his home in a village. Here an
Armenian priest took it from the man
and having torn it to pieces threw it
into the street. A grocer, seeing it
lying there, picked it up and took it
to his shop, where he began to use it
as wrapping paper. So for a time
â olives, cheese, candles and other things
wer.? wrapped in pages upon which
were printed the "Words of Life." In
this wav one Bible was scattered
about through that village and was
read by many whose interest was so
far aroused that they began asking for
more of the same book. The result
was that when the colporteur next
came round over one hundred Bibles
or portions of the Bible were sold in
that vMlage.â"Sowing the Bible,"

Typical Lake of Italy.
For two years an exhaustive mono
graph on a typical lake of Italy has
been in course of preparation by the
Italian Geographical Society. The
picturesque lake of Bolsena, within
easy reach from Rome, was selected
for the purpose and the studies in
clude the geographical and geological
features, the rainfall and temperature
and seasonal variations, the changes
of level, the seiches of rhythmical pul
sations of the surface and the life
forms. The seiches constitute one of
the most interesting of the phenom
ena. These have a regular period of
twelve or fifteen minutes, the rise of
the water on occasions reaching a foot
and the oscillations are often so
marked that the natives speak of the
lake as panting. They are more con
spicuous at Narta than on the oppo
site side of the lake at Bolsena, a rise
of seven inches at the former being
correlated with one of four inches at
the latter.

Dinner With Austrian Emperor.
Prom the London Chronicle.
The Emperor Francis Joseph has a
rule of life which greatly perturbs
some members of his court. He dines
every day at half-past 5, and he has
done this since the beginning of his
reign. As the hour does not suit every
body, it follows that the personages
who are honored with invttations to
dine with the Emperor find it very
difficult to muster an appetite for din
ner at tea time. They suffer in silence
for the most part, but It is said that a
certain great lady resolved to act.
She was invited to dine with the
Emperor, but she sat at table and ate
nothing. The kindly sovereign feared
she was indisposed. No. she was quite
well. Then why did she send every
dish away? "Sire," she answered, "I
never eat between meals." The rep
artee has had a success at Vienna. But
the Emperor still dines at half-past 5,
without the society of that great lady.
What Interested Secretary Root.
From the Philadelphia. Record.
William H. Taft, Secretary of War,
weighs 320 pounds. His predecessor in
office. Elihu Root, tips the scales at
only half that figure.
When Secretary Taft was Civil Gov
ernor of the Philippines his health was
sadly undermined. He was laboring
under great responsibility in governing
the archipelago, where conditions were
yet so disturbed as to give Secretary
Root and President Roosevelt much
concern. Mr. Root therefore requested
Judge Taft to keep him advised by the
new Pacific cable as to the state of his
health. One day this message came to
Root from Governor Taft, at Benguet,
in the mountains near Manila:
' Rode ten miles on a mule to-day.
Am feeling much better. TAFT."
Mr. Root chuckled and doubled with
mirth in the chair which Secretary
Taft has since discarded as too small.
He dictated this reply:
"Taft, Benguet: Glad to hear it, but
how is the mule? ROOT."
George Ade as a Farm Hand.

Judge Saunderson, who is practicing

George Ade, the humorist.
"Ade was a peculiar character In his
younger years," says the Judge. "He
made my office a sort of loafing place
during the little time he spent in loaf
ing. He was employed on a farm own
ed by a banker. One day he walked
into the office and said to me:
" 'That man is the best I ever worked
for.'
" 'Why?' I asked, for I knew that
something funny was coming from
Ade.
" 'Well,' he replied, 'he doesn't ask a
man to do a day's work in ten hours
he gives him sixteen.'
"As a bqy we didn't suppose that Ade
would amount to much," continued the
Judge, "though his drollery was always

HAT MADE A SENATOR.
The truthful story is told in Mis
souri that the throwing of a broad
brimmed hat to the ceiling of the hall
of the House of Representatives in the
Capitol at Jefferson City made Fran
cis Marion Cockrell a member of the
United States Senate. The State had
been stirred by a contest for the Dem
ocratic nomination for the Governor
ship. The lines between supporters
of opposing candidates were sharply
drawn. In a State convention num
bering a thousand delegates Charles
H. Hardin had won by the narrow
majority of one-half of one vote. 9o
close was the result and so bitter the
feeling that the Democratic leaders
feared irreconcilable division in the
party ranks. The result, however,
had scarcely been announced from the
secretary's desk when the tall figure
of the defeated candidate, General
Cockrell, was seen coming to the plat
form. A moment more, as the hush
of expectancy fell upon the crowded
hall, Cockrell's voice rang out. "No
man," said he, "will more loyally sup
port the nominee of the convention
than myself. No man will throw his
hat higher for Charley Hardin than
will I." And away to the ceiling went
the broad,-brimmed Cockrell hat The
convention, frantic with enthusiasm,
heard not another word, but the fol
lowing spring General Cockrell be
came United States Senator by the
unanimous vote of the Democrats of
Missouri. For five successive terms,
since March 4, 1875, with never a
Democratic vote against him, he has
been elected to the Senatorship, the
first and only political office he ever
held. No Senator from his State has
surpassed this record in length of
years and none has equaled it, save
Thomas Hart Benton, the great Mis
sourian.âWalter Williams in The

MRS. ASTRID NAESS, a
Norwegian lady, who served
in the British secret ser

which desires to place her in a lunatic

BY THE REV. FREDERICK W. CLAMPETT, D. D., Rector Trinity Church.
IF the stability and prosperity of
the national life is dependent
upon the stability and prosper
ity of family life, it stands to
reason that the safeguarding of
the home is a patriotic as well as a
religious duty. Thus the disciple of
Christ may join with the leader of
ethics and the master of social eco
nomics in the endeavor to work out
the tremendous problem in a solution
that will result in the uplift of the
people. And every effort, conscien
tiously put forward by strong, conse
crated man, whether in the name of
the church or in the name of common
sense (and these are not opposed to
I one another), should be hailed with
joy. Morality and congested popu
} lation do not coexist. And the man
j who, like Dr. Riis, bestows his life
jto the matter of proper housing is
i the champion of sane conditions. The
I man who, like Professor Adler of New

Now, in dealing with this subject
in so far only as the church's rela
tions and responsibilities are con
cerned, I intend to point out three
âways in which the sanctity of the
family is assailed and weakened to
an alarming extent, and to suggest
two corresponding forces whereby
the downward tendency may be not
only checked, but altogether crushed.
When we speak of the home we
are apt. as a rule, to picture in our
minds a staid, permanent condition
of recognized standing. But the stu
dent of the family and the accom
panying responsibilities must not lose
sight of that day in which the alli
ance of two persons in the betrothal
of heart to heart made that home a
possibility. The sacred hour of life's
consecration bears a most important
place in any study of this subject.
And after an experience of over twen
ty years of ministry, in which my lot
has been cast in city work, where the
the conclusion that the war had un

Then, worse than all, I ate a strange

and I very naturally and without
thinking told them it was a brain
food. That was the last straw. They
were convinced then that not only was
my mind weak, but that I knew it
was weak, so they sent for the village
doctor, and he, if you please, certified
me insane.

! problems are larger, harder and more
intense, I have no hesitation in as
serting that the methods that lead up
to the marriage compact are largely
responsible for the assault upon its
sanctity. And the first is undue and
thoughtless haste. If marriage were
simply a game of dice, an act of
chance, in which the contracting par
ties shook the box and counted their
numbers, it could not be less sacred-
I ly considered than a great percentage
iof young persons indicate. It is the
j duty of the church to admonish, in
I the strongest possible terms, the most
careful and thoughtful procedure be
fore the act of betrothal. Admira
tion must not be mistaken for love.
Selfish interests must not sacrifice
life interests. The desire to experi
ence the novelty of new sur
roundings and to cut loose
from the old _ family tie must
never stifle the question of love and
love reciprocated. The greatest test
that comes in a young woman's life
is that moment when she is called
upon to render the great decisionâ
to give back the answer that involves
good one, live so absolutely out of . the
world âsuch a Quaker existence â
that they are almost 100 years be
hind the times.

for a careful testing of motive, of
heart, of destiny, it is that hour when
there hangs in the balance, trem
blingly awaiting the moment of de

the solemnity of the words of our
awfully sacred service should then
ring in her ears! "Wilt thou have
this man to be thy wedded husband,
to live together after God's ordinance,
in the holy estate of matrimony?
Wilt thou obey him and serve him,
love, honor and keep him in sickness
and in health, and, forsaking all oth
ers, keep thee only unto him, so long
as ye both shall live?"

"I ran as hard as I could to a law
yer's office. Then presently, when I
learned that if* was safe to return, I
went back to the hotel, only to find
that my brother had removed all my
clothes and belongings. The landlady
hid me for some days, and I had the
greatest difficulty to escape and go to
Copenhagen, as my brother and a whole
army of detectives were watching the
railway stations and the hotel.
"However, I did escape, and from
Copenhagen I came to London, where I
have several influential friends. From
London I wrote numerous letters to the
authorities, together with a certificate
of my sanity, but they took no notice
at all. Indeed, my brother was writing
to our Consul in London that he must

Jewish creeds. How often do you
find the columns of our daily press
satisfying a morbidly inclined public
with the family scandal of a Roman
Catholic or a Jew? And why? Be
cause these great bodies look upon
the marriage compact as a great sac
rament, not to be entered unadvised
ly or lightly, but reverently, discreet
ly, advisedly, soberly, and in the fear
of God. Public sentiment may not
coujft for much, but national con
science counts for a great deal; and
we need a national conscience that
will despise the woman or man that
will barter his daughter for the title
of a nobleman (who often is not a
noble-man), that will permit his child
to contract a hasty marriage.
The second (and fn the strongest
way in which the English language
makes it possible to express it), the
most damnable blight upon the home
life of to-day is the character of the
divorce laws of this republic. I be
lieve we are on the threshold of an
agitation destined to become national
in character, aiming at the present

"After a while I determined to go to
Stockholm, where the laws are differ

could not take me as insane there, be
cause the Norwegian doctor's certificate
did not apply.
"When I got to Stockholm, however,
I found that the King was away yacht
ing, so I wrote him a letter inclosing
various documents testifying to my
sanity and also to my services to the
British Government. I received prompt-
ly a reply from the Kammerherr, Aug
ust Sibbern, saying that the documents
had been forwarded to the Minister of
Justice and that the King had ordered
a prompt inquiry into my case.

GETTING READY
FOR INSPECTOR
Criticisms of Reviews of
Last Year Not Given Out
in the Orders Since Then
WOULD VISIT POKTLAND
Target Practice to Be Com
menced During* the Latter
Part of the Current Month
It has been decided that the inspec
tion of the various organizations of the
California National Guard for the War
Department shall be begun February 1
by Major Wilhelm. U. S. A. (retired).
As yet no information has been re
ceived as to whether there shall be an
Inspection at the same time for the ]
State. In the opinion of many inter- J
ested in the matter, it is doubtful if it j
is expedient to have such additional in- j
spection in view of the fact that there j
has not been anything published in or
ders as to the inspection of 1904. None
of the commands have been advised of I
any criticisms offered by the State in- !
spector, consequently the officers and
men have not had an opportunity to
correct the mistakes discovered.
During the latter part of the month
nearly all the organizations in the
State will begin target practice, a suf
ficient number of suitable ranges hay- j
ing been found to accommodate them. |
Tt is expected that this year it will be I
possible to carry on this practice in j
regular form, so that the men shall
become better versed in the use of the
new arms supplied to them.
I Captain Grattan of Battery B, First
Battalion of Artillery, is the author of â¢
a plan for the four batteries to visit i
the Lewis and Clark Exposition in j
Portland, Ore., with the idea <rf show- |
! ing the people of neighboring States !
! what the National Guard of California j
;is composed of. The proposition has |
been heartily indorsed and as soon as .
Captain Grattan receives a reply to a j
communication he has addressed to the ;
managers of the exposition, he will lay !
the same before the four commands. ;
The subject has been broached to Ad- j
jutant General Lauck. who favors j
the movement and has shown a willing
ness to do what he can to help it along, j
If the idea is carried out, the artillery
band will accompany the batteries.
A new gun crew is being organized
in the Ellis street armory with a view j
to challenging the crew now existing
and to create a rivalry in the matter
of handling and using the gattling gun
with which the men practice at drills.
After the first meeting in January of
; Company B, Fifth Infantry. San Jose,
! there was an adjournment to the drill !
room, which had been converted into
a dining hall, and there the officers and
men enjoyed a repast. During the even
ing Captain Holtum, commanding the
company, read the following letter re- j
ceived from Governor Pardee, the com
mander in chief of the National Guard
of the State:
"I haVe the honor to congratulate you
upon the excellent report of the in
specting officer upon the general effi
ciency of your command at tjie in
spection of 1904. Special mention is
made of the very neat and clean ap
pearance of your company, also of the
exceptionally good manner in which
the extended order drill was executed. I
I take this opportunity of expressing
my appreciation of the interest you
have manifested in thus bringing your
command to its present high state of
efficiency."
The reading of this letter was re
ceived with enthusiasm and the mem
bers promised to do their level best to
attain a still higher efficiency and so
make Company B one of the very best
in the regiment.
The members of Company D, Fifth
Infantry, had a delightful masquerade
in the armory at San Rafael last week,
which was attended by a large number
of the residents of that city. There i
were many maskers on the floor and a
number of well sustained characters to
whom were awarded prizes. The affair j
was admirably arranged and managed I
by the committee composed of E. Gard
ner, E. Collamore, G. Williams, R. Cur
ry and J. Kerrigan.
DUNSMUIR CASE IS AGAIN
BEFORE CONSUL BENNETT
The battle for the Dunsmuir mil- j
lions was again actively resumed be
fore British Consul Bennett yesterday '
morning at 10:30 o'clock. The James j
Dunsmuir side has heretofore, in tak- j
ing the testimony before the Consul, j
been represented by A. P. Luxton and j
Andrew Thome. Yesterday the force
was increased by the presence of At
torney Charles S. Wheeler, who will
act with them as associates.
The only witness called yesterday
was Attorney John J. Dwyer. Mr.
Dwyer was for over three years with
the Hibernia Bank in charge of the
passing on of will matters that came
up for the bank's consideration. His
testimony was entirely given to cita
tions from the civil code on the rela
tion of probate matters to the judicial
system of California. The examina
tion was made entirely by Mr.
Wheeler. It was really a citing of
substantive law versus rules of evl
dtnee.
At 1 o'clock the hearing ended.
The case will be resumed at 10:30
o'clock to-morrow morning, when At
torney Dwyer will â¢ again take the
stand.
Steal Whisky From Grocery.
Two men entered the barroom at
Henry Reincke's grocery, 500 Sixth
street, shortly after midnight yester- I
day morning and ordered two glasses I
of beer. While the bartender was j
drawing the beer the two men picked I
|up two cases and ran out with them, i
One of the cases was filled with bot- |
i ties of whisky, but the other had i
nothing but empty bottles in it. There
were two other men at the bar at the
time and the bartender, suspecting that
there were confederates of the thieves
and waitina* for a chance to rob the
1 cash register, did not pursue. The
; police were notified.
Stableman Is Injured.
Fred M. Bruer, a stableman employed
at 20 Clay street, fell through a trap
door yesterday morning and sustained
a fractnre of his left leg. \
EASY FORTUNES
FAIL TO COME
Suit Filed Against Two Get-
Rich-Quick Concerns That
Did Land-Office Business
CONTRACTS AEE UNPAID
Disappointed Purchasers Al
lege Fraud and Demand
Return of Their 3loney
The most important of H. F. Hob- j
I son's many suits against the get-rich- j
i quick concerns in this city was filed
J yesterday. Hobson and twenty-six con
i tract holders are the plaintiffs, and the
j defendants are the Fidelity Funding
| Company, the Empire Diamond Co
! partnership, the Empire Diamond Cor
i poration and F. L. Dever, E. J. Carpen-
I ter, E. C. Hedges, W. L. Pierce and D.
: Boyle, officers and directors of the com
j panics.
It is charged that more than $780,000
I has been invested in the illegal con
j tracts, which promised $100 diamonds
; for $80, or $150 in coin for $100 paid in
j weekly installments. Judgment is de-
I manded for $780,000, the appointment of
j a receiver and an injunction preventing
j the transfer of records and assets.
The complaint says that the diamond
i company sold over 15,000 contracts,
j upon which $600,000 has been paid, and
| that 3000 of the contracts are now ma
; tured and unpaid. A fraud order was
' issued by the postal authorities against
j the company on February 6, 1904, and
on the same day the Fidelity Funding
Company was incorporated for the pur
i pose of continuing the business under
j another form of contract. It is alleged
I that in the transfer the copartners in
| the diamond concern represented that
I their joint interest was worth $200,000.
! and they received this amount of stock
\in the funding company. The plaintiffs
i declare that this was a wholly fictitious
: value, as the value of the joint interest
i "consisted merely in personal and in
j dividual ability to obtain money under
! false and fraudulent representations,
j and defraud the public and contract
! purchasers."
They say it was falsely represented
that W. L. Pierce visited Washington,
interviewed the postal department and
i was told that the Fidelity Funding
Company could issue and sell its con-
I tracts, which were not illegal.
| It is -said, too, that the Fidelity Com
j pany would insure the unexpired con
j tracts of the Diamond Company. On
these representations over 6000 of the
I Fidelity contracts have been sold. None
|of them has matured, and the money
I collected is being used to pay off the
! Diamond contracts, although the latter
j have been declared illegal.
The plaintiffs also aver that Pierce
has left the city with the company's
funds for the purpose of getting them
away from the jurisdiction of the
courts.

Board of Works Urges Yorke
| Company to Resume Repair
of Bituminous Pavements
WANT PROMPT ACTION
Supervisors Blamed for De
laying Progress by Not
Paying the Bills Incurred
] The Board of Public Works yesterday
began an investigation into the con
tract for repairs to bituminous streets
held by the F. M. Yorke Company, who
have stopped work because of differ
; ences with the Supervisors* Finance
Committee.
i "Mr. Yorke is preparing an answer
which will explain the entire matter,"
said Alexander O'Grady, attorney for
the company, "and the answer will be
submitted next Wednesday. The bill
for repairs during August is being held
jup by the Finance Committee on the
ground that the computations of the
surface covered are fraudulent. The
computations were made by Inspector
Boone, who the committee says is an
: honorable man. The company is un
â  willing to proceed with its contract un
| til the city pays it $14,000 doe."
"All eyes are upon this board to see
that it performs its duty to put in good
condition the streets, which are in a
deplorable state," said Commissioner
. Aigeltinger. "If your contract is valid
; why do you not sue the city and get
. your money?"
j "We are not willing to spend as much
as the amount of the demapds to estab
lish our claims in court," said O'Grady.
"We would have to bring an action on
each demand."
LEGALITY OF CONTRACT.
"This contract should be referred to
the City Attorney for an opinion as to
I its legality," said Aigeltinger. "Then
you could commence an action. You
should co-operate with this board in its
desire to repair the streets."
"The question of the legality of the
contract should originate in the Board
of Supervisors, but anything that
: comes from the Supervisors should be
! in writing, as they are very unreliable,"
j said Commissioner Maestretti. "I do not
believe that we have any authority to
refer the matter to the City Attorney.
I presume that your company wants
to do the work, but you want your
money for what you have done."
"Are we to understand," asked Com
' missioner Eagan, "that no repairs will
Ibe made until the dispute with the Su
pervisors is settled, and that we must
sit quietly by pending such settlement?"
( "As we are not guilty of any breach
â of contract, it would look that way,"
I replied O'Grady. "We will be prepared
to state next Wednesday whether we
| will proceed with the repairs notwith- ,
i standing the refusal of the Supervisors j
I to pay our demands."
P. M. Gopcevic, a member of the j
! Yorke company, assented to O'Grady's
last statement.
LICENSES OF THEATRES.
The board began an inquiry into the
report of City Architect Shea that sev
eral minor theaters do not comply with
the theater ordinance and recommend
ing that no licenses be issued for their
i conduct. The theaters under consid
] eration are the Lyceum, Unique, Nov
: elty and Cinegraph.
M. Furst of the Cinegraph stated
I that he had expended $2000 in altera
' tlons in compliance with the orders of
J the City Architect, who, however, had
j disapproved of them.
"I was refused a license by the Tax
' Collector because I could not secure
a permit, and I closed up the place,"
! said Furst.
"It seems strange," said Maestretti.
| "that after you made the alterations
!-you were compelled to go out of busi
j ness without protesting. It is a re
flection on this board, and all the trou
ble has been caused by Al Lillenfeldt.
foreman of the late Grand Jury. The
owners of these theaters have been
! notified to make alterations. If they
I have made the alterations it is for us
! to send an inspector to see if the alter-
I alions have been made and take action
on his report."
The matter was thereupon deferred
for one week. , **
TO PAVE FOURTH STREET.
The board had prepared resolutions
I recommending to the Board of Super
j visors that Fourth street, from Market
jto Berry, be repaved; but favorable
action was postponed until next
i Wednesday, when the resolutions or
dering bids to be invited for the im
provement of H street and for the re
pairing of the Phelan block pavement
and the construction of a safety sta
tion at Market and Powell streets will
be adopted.
C. Schilling informed the board that
a wooden building at 107 Market street
was being reconstructed by the Doe
estate in violation of the law fixing
the fire limits and asking that the work
be stopped. Schilling said that the
owners had boasted of a political pull,
and Commissioner Aigeltinger took ex
ception to a remark made by Schilling
previous to the meeting that he did
not hope to obtain much satisfaction
from a "packed board." Aigeltinger
said he would insist on the law being
obeyed, and he was delegated by the
board to Inquire into the complaint.
Schilling admitted that the alterations
had been stopped two or three times
{by the building inspectors for viola
tions of the building laws.
The bond of the United Railroads for
I blasting for the proposed California
street extension line was fixed at
$10,000. It is intended' to blow up the
stonm road tunnel on Bakers Beach.
General Manager Chapman assured
the board that the company would re
pave between its tracks to conform
to new pavements on clement and
other streets in the Richmond district.
City Engineer Woodward submitted
plans and specifications for the pav
ing with asphalt of Mission street, be
tween Onondaga and Porter avenues,
and the removal of the box sewer in
Mission street between Mohawk and
Italy avenues. No estimate of cost ac
companied the plans, although $80,000
has been appropriated for the work.
Th*e City Engineer was directed to
investigate the complaint of residents
that rubbish is accumulating on a
strip of land on Clay street, near

NEW YORK, Jan. 14.âJames Met

and for three hours endured the tor

the managament made when it found
the dramatic critic had passed the door

passed the door unchallenged is a mys

the playhouse, waved their hands dep
recatingly and said, "Nothing to say;

had come to see that no carnage should

Makes Deal With

Disposes ol His Extensive
Interests in Canton-
Hankow Line,
Transcontinental Road Through the
Richest Fart of China Is Made
Probable by Transfer.
PARIS. Jan. 14.âInformation from
Brussels reaching the highest quarters
here shows it is the extensive interests
of King Leopold in the Canton-Han
kow Railroad which have passed into
the hands of representatives of J.
Pierpont Morgan of New York.
Negotiations had been .u'cing on for
some time, as it was contemplated to
combine French, Belgian and Ameri
can interests so as to eventually cover
the Franco-Belgian concession for a
line from Peking to Hankow, thus
making a continuous trunk line from
Peking to Canton, over 2500 miles, cut
ting from north to south through the
heart of populous China. The extent
of this project is compared, by those
familiar with the negotiations, with
the transcontinental lines connecting
New York and San Francisco.
That portion of the project relating
to Peking and Hankow is still in abey- I
ance, but the French view appears j
favorable to combining the interests ,
so as to make a continuous route from !
the capital to the great emporium in
the south. That portion relating to
the Hankow-Canton Railroad is consid
ered to have been closed by the trans
fer of the interests of which the per
sonal holdings of King Leopold make
up the largest part to Morgan. This
branch of the negotiations was con
ducted at Brussels.
The concession of the Hankow-Can
ton Railroad was originally American
and then passed under Belgian con
trol. The line is about 1200 miles long
and the extension to Peking will be
about 1400 miles, a total of 2600 miles,
without counting the extensive spurs
toward Klaochau and Tientsin and
Shanghai.
Reports received from China show
there is much native agitation against
foreign railroad enterprises and the
authorities here fear this may inter
fere with the proper development of
French, Belgian and American inter
ests. The native opposition is not con
fined to the ignorant classes. It in
cludes Chinese capitalists who are in
terested in the earnings of the rail
roads. These have combined with the
Pqrtuguese on the line from Canton
to Macao. They recently held a vio
lent meeting in a Buddhist temple at
Canton for the purpose of opposing
foreign control of the railroads.

Ministry's Policy is Approved by Ma

the Chamber.
PARIS, Jan. 15. 2:15 a m.âPremier
Combes' Cabinet weathered a storm in
the Chamber of Deputies' session last
ing until after 1 o'clock this morning,
and had a majority of ten on a motion
supporting the declarations of the Min
isters and approving the policy of the
Government. The result was reached
after a debate marked by frequent vio
lent altercations, threatening a free
fight, and during the course of which
an opposition deputy flourished a
saucepan in the face of the Premier.
The majority, although not large, is
considered sufficient to insure the re
tention of the Ministry.
It was generally expected that the
session would culminate in the over
throw of the Ministry of Premier
Combes, and the floors and gallery
were packed by persons who desired to
witness the final struggle. The con
test against the Ministry had been
slowly gaining ground. The principal
elements of opposition were:
First, those combatting the policy of
Premier Combes for separation of
church and state; second, those de-
nouncing the Government's collection
of secret reports regarding the lives, of
army officers, and, third, those com
plaining of the tardiness of the Minis
try in passing a law creating an income
tax.
These various elements sapped the
Strength of tlje majority until Pre mi a r
Combes found himself confronted by a
rebellion in his own ranks. His speech
in closing the three days' debate on the
policy of the Government was a ve
hement defense of his Ministry and a
denunciation of his detractors.
"They are the same men who sought
to protect Esterhazy, who glorified Col
onel Henry and who now seek to arouse
the army to the pitch of attempting a
coup d'etat," said Combes.
The Premier referred to the cal
umnies which had not spared his white
hair. He wished to complete the work
against the religious associations and
if the Ministry were retained, he said,
it would proceed to consider the income
tax and Â»workingmen's pensions, and
the separation of church and state, but
the latter would be modified so as to
avoid any spirit of intolerance. In
closing Premier Combes said:
"1 hope the majority will be main
tained in order to carry out this policy.
If there is to be another Ministry it
would be one of reaction. The Cham
ber must choose between marching on
ward or lending itself to reaction."
The speech was interrupted by noisy
demonstrations of applause and dis-
approval.
Ribc-t and Bos attacked the Minister,
the latter declaring that Combes' pol
icy was one of falsehood and dissimula
tion. An indescribable tumult fol
lowed. The Socialists endeavored to
scale the benches to attack members on
the opposite side Of the Chamber and
amid cries of "Traitor!" "Coward:"
"Assassin!" the President temporarily
suspended the session.
The violent scenes were renewed
when the session resumed, and a pre
liminary vote showed the Government
had a majority of ten. The decisive
vote was taken on a motion of Bien
venu Martin approving the declarations
and programme of the Government,
which was adopted by a vote of 289 to
279.

CHICAGO, Jan. 14.âAs a director for

wealthy business man of New York, is
charged in a suit brought in the United
States Circuit Court here to-day with
having been a party to an illegal decla

before learning that Purcell had left
Chicago for California a week ago.

BY. HER HUSBAND
Alleged Incompe
tent Begins to
Doubt Her.
NEW YORK. Jan. 14.âMrs. Brodle I*
Duke, whose marriage to Brodie I*.
Duke, a half-brother of the president
of the American Tobacco Company,
was followed by her husband's commit
ment to a sanitarium and proceedings
to inquire into his sanity, made a
statement to-day Of the circumstances
under which she met and married
Duke. Mrs. Duke declared that she
wanted to be set right before the pub
lic. She told how she met Duke as the
result of an effort to secure a loan on
tobacco lands in Texas, and said that
she was dumfounded when Duke pro
posed marriage to her; that Duke had
promised to give her stocks and bonds,
but had never done so.
Mrs. Duke said that , she had been
largely interested in tobacco raising in
terests near Redfield. Tex., that she
was formerly in business in Chicago
and that she was a land and immigra
tion agent of the Southern Pacific Com
pany. She had required the sum of
$18,500 to pay for the Redfield land, as,
although she had possession of it, she
did not have a clear title, because the
land belonged to the bankrupt firm of
Sully & Co., which could not deliver a
deed to her. Her first introduction to
Duke was the outcome of the attempt
to obtain a loan from him to develop
her lands at Redfield.
"Mr. Duke came up and saw me in
New York, and three days afterward
he asked me to marry him," said Mrs.
Duke. "I was dumfounded at the re
quest, but he insisted that I become his
wife, and I finally consented and we
were married on December 19.
"When Mr. Duke asked me to marry
him we discussed his family affairs.
The fact that he had been twice mar
ried and had four children made me
realize that it would be unpleasant for
me to marry him and enter into his
family. However, I told him that I
would sign an agreement not to accept
any of his property in case of death,
only securing for myself my own prop
erty at Redfield. In reply to this Mr.
Duke said:
" 'I believe in you now, and I will
never doubt you any more. I shall trust
you and I will find a way to give you
while I am alive stocks and bonds, and
what is left after my death the children
can fight over if they want to.' "
"Did Mr. Duke give you any such
stocks and bonds?" was asked.
"No, he never did."
Mrs. Duke then told of her marriage
by Rev. W. W. Cde in New York. They
lived in a hotel until Duke was taken
away, she said.
"I have nothing to fear in Texas."
she said. "I am not afraid to go back
there, and while I have no knowledge
of any indictment against me there, I
can conceive of no reason for one. This
property of mine in Texas I have im
proved by building houses for tenants
and have made it self-supporting. I
also have raised a crop of tobacco."
Mrs. Duke produced a letter which
she said was writetn by her husband
to her father, in which he wrote of her
in affectionate terms.
Mrs. Duke said tnat she was born
near Buffalo thirty-seven years ago,
and came to Mrs. Desplalnes' boarding
house in this city when 12 years old.
Her mother, she said, was Helen E.
Chapman, a .daughter of the professor
of languages in the University of New
London. Hor grandfather was Thomas
S. Webb, the father of Free Masonry
in this country, she declared. She also
told of her marriase in 1885 to George
W r . Hopkinson, which marriage, she
said, was annulled, and of her marriage
in 1897 to Edward F. Powell and her di
vorce from him in 1903.
After a conference with his attorney
to-day W T . G. Bramhatn, private secre
tary to Brodie L. Duke, gave out the
following statement:
"Mr. Duke will have nothing to do
with his wife until all the charges
made ' against him are thoroughly
cleared. Mr. Duke is as sane as any
man living and in my opinion he will
be released from the charge of insan
ity. Mr. Duke told mo yesterday h|
would not see Mrs. Duke or any of
her representatives. If any of tlmi
charges against Mrs. Duke prove truÂ«
he will have his marriage annulled."
NACOGDOCHES, Tex., Jan. 14âThe
specific charge of swindling made
against Charles E. Taylor and Mrs.
Alice Webb-Duke grew out of a trans
action In which the pair. It is alleged,
borrowed $3000 from the president of
the Commercial National Bank, they
havlng made alleged farse representa
tions and having given alleged false
recommendations. No effort has been
made to secure the return of either of
them toÂ» Texas, but District Attorney
Imboden says that hÂ« Is willing to co

People of Central and South
America.
WILLEMSTADT, Jan. 14. âAdvices

Small Army of Corporation

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.â"The rail
road people of this country would hold
up their hands in thankfulness to
heaven if Congress should adjourn to
night and never come back again,"
was the remark made to-day by one
of the railway attorneys now here to
fight railway legislation of any kind.
This precisely illustrates the attitude
of the railroad presidents and attor
neys who have been in Washington*for
the last few days. They are here in
droves and are united against any in
creased power for the Interstate Com
merce Commission, which the Presi
dent seems determined to have.
The most interesting feature to-day
of the railroad rate situation, as de
veloped between President Roosevelt
and the great railroad presidents, was
the appearance of James J. Hill, presi
dent of the Great Northern Railway
and chief factor in the Northern Se
curities Company, at the White House.
It was the first time Hill had been
in any conference with the President
since the Northern Securities suit was
begun. He went to the White House
by appointment, accepted Mr. Roose
velt's invitation to remain to luncheon
and SDent an hour and a half in con
versation. Rate legislation was dis
cussed and Hili is understood to have
reiterated his views expressed in The
Call to-day about the delicate busi
ness situation and the iniquity of re
bates. It is further understood that
President Roosevelt was unable to
convince him of the wisdom of In
creasing the powers of the Interstate
Commerce Commission to the extent
of permitting it to establish railroad
rates.
The most Important progress toward
the passing of a rate bill has been
made in the House. Colonel Hepburn,
chairman of the House Interstate
Commerce Committee, was an im
portant caller upon the President. Sec
retary Taft, who has become a factor
in the rate problem, joined the con
ference. Colonel Hepburn announced
later that he has prepared a rate bill
which would be considered at a con
ference next week with the President,
Secretary Taft, Attorney General
Moody and members of the Interstate
Commerce Commission.
CITY OF MARYSVILLE
FILES CROSS-COMPLAINT
Seeks to Recover Damages From Con
tracting Firm That Brought Suit
Against the Municipality.
MARYSVILLE, Jan. 14.âThe most
important case heard here in several
years closed this afternoon after a
two weeks' trial before Judge E. P.
McDaniel in the Superior Court. The
action was brought by the City Street
Improvement Company against the
city of Marysville to recover - $4000
balance due on the sanitary sewer sys
tem built by the plaintiff last year. In
a cross-complaint the city asked dam
ages and reimbursement for rebuilding
the sewer, the total amount being $50,
--000. The cross-complaint was amend
ed to-day by Increasing the amount
to $60,977 62, which almost equals the
contract arice of the sewer. Expert
testimony showed the very faulty con
struction of the sewer. The plaintiff
apparently depends upon the point
that the work was accepted and ap
proved by Engineer Marsden Manson
and the Inspectors employed by the
city. The testimony was completed to
day and arguments will be heard next
Friday.

Un January 10, at 2 o'clock in the

in the face of a furious fire from bat

i Imperial Rescript Lauds the Defenders
of Port Arthur.
| ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 14.âEm
peror Nicholas has addressed the fol
lowing rescript to the army and navy:
"Port Arthur has passed Into the
hands of the enemy. During eleven
months the fight had been going on In
Its defense. More than seven months
its noble defenders had been cut off
from the rest of the world. Without
any oositive assurance of relief they
continued to fight and did everything i
in their power to check the progress '
\of the enemy, sparing neither life nor
j heart's blood to uphold the honor of the
I Russian people.
"Russia, with pride and admiration, j
j followed each move in the contest. The !
j whole world was astounded at their
gallantry, but dairy their ranks were
I thinned, their power of resistance di- I
minished, and under repeated attacks
by the enemy they were forced to give
way.
"Peace* honor and undying memory
will be the portion of you Russians
who have fallen in the defense of Port
; Arthur. Far from home you have laid
your bodies upon alien soilâa sacrifice
to the dictates to your honor and the
: demands of your Emperor.
I "Peace and honor be your portion!
Always will you be so held in our
hearts and memory.
"Honor to the living! May God re
store you to health and strength and
. give you patience to face this disaster
with which you are confronted,
j "My gallant troops and sailors, do not
1 let this sorrow dismay you. Our enemy
is strong and daring. This fight against
him occurs 7000 miles from our home;
but Russia is powerful. In the thousand
years of its existence there have been
still heavier trials, worse and more
threatening dangers, but Russia ever
arose from trial with renewed force
and strength. Do not let your souls be
troubled by lack of success and heavy
losses. Russian strength grows with
adversity.
"With all Russia, I Join in the belief
that the time is coming when God will
give strength to our glorious army and
navy to arise and break the forces of
the enemy. NICHOLAS."
New Year's reviews by the various
newspapers admit frankly that the
Japanese have had the better of the
war so far, but the whole tone of the
press is summed up in the following
statement in the Russ:
"They have done well, but not well
enough. They have intrenched them
selves in Korea as though they were at
home, have captured Port Arthur and
i made conquest of most of Southern
Manchuria, but are face to face with
; a Russian army of equal numbers, and
they are checked. The new year will
show the Russian flag raised again
1 along the borders of the warm water."

In diplomatic quarters the circular is
regarded as a move to forestall com
| plaints of Russian transgressions of
' Chinese territory, coining from Japan,
i but not as indicating any immediate or
i serious action on Russia's part.
At the Chinese Legation it was as
; serted that China had maintained a
j neutrality such as few European pow
ers could have kept in the face of the
; most trying circumstances.
"If China violated the neutrality,"
it was asked, "what have Germany and
France done? Why select China for
such a formal charge to the powers?
I it is not a question of preference upon
i the part of the Chinese populace, for

1 more than they do the Russians."
FRANCE ANGERS JAPAN.
Aid Given Russian Fleet Regarded as ,
Breach of Neutrality.
TOKIO, Jan. 14.âThe French are
sharply criticized for permitting the
! ships of the second Pacific squadron
!of the Russian navy to make a pro
! longed stay at Madagascar. Heretofore
j the Japanese press and people, realiz
! ing the peculiar position in which
| Fiance was placed, were not disposed
;to judge her actions too severely, but
I the Asahi to-day says:
"It is no longer possible to overlook
! the French non-observance" of neutral
; ity, or her disregard for the obligations
jof a neutral nation. Coaling the ships
;of the second Pacific squadron in
! French ports has culminated in allow
! ing Rear Admiral Rodjestvensky to re
â  main for twelve days awaiting rein
: forcements, and in the use of Madagas
! car as a base of operations against the
Japanese fieet, now reported in the ln
; dian Ocean.
i "Such action is little less than hos
i tile, and if France is sincere In her
! promise of strict neutrality the ships
jof the second Pacific squadron ought
! long ago to have been sent away or dis
! armed. Further temporizing for the
j purpose of rendering assistance to the
j Russian vessels must be considered a
j serious breach of neutrality."
BERLIN, Jan. 14.âThe Japanese
| Government, taking cognizance of an
I impression that Germany has not ob
served strict neutrality, has sent a for
â  mal dispatch of thanks to the German
! Government. It expresses the convic
! tion that Germany has fulfilled her
i duties as a neutral throughout the war
with exactness, especially during the
recent events in the war zone.
PARIS, Jan. 14.âThe crilicials here
say that the Japanese criticism of
France relative to the stay of the Rus-
I sian second Pacific squadron at Mada
-1 gascar has no importance, as the
squadron is no longer in French waters.

What Sulphur Does
For the Human Body in Health and ,
Disease.
The mentioa of sulphur will recall to ;
many of us the early days when our
mothers and grandmothers gave us our
daily dose of sulphur and molasses ,
every spring and fall.
It was the universal spring and fall
"blood purifier," tonic and cure-all, and
mind you, this old-fashioned remedy
was not without merit.
The idea was good, but the remedy
was crude and unpalatable, and a large
quantity had to be taken to get any
effect.
Nowadays we get all the beneficial '
effects of sulphur in a palatable, con- ]
centrated form, so that a single grain
is far more effective than a tablespoon
ful of the crude sulphur.
In recent years, research and expert- !
ment have proven that the best sulphur
for medicinal use is that obtained from
Calcium (Calcium Sulphide) and sold in
drug stores under the name of Stuart's
Calcium Wafers. They are small cho- i
colate coated pellets and contain the
active medicinal principle of sulphur in ]
a highly concentrated, effective form.
Few people are aware of the value of
this form of sulphur in restoring and
maintaining bodily vigor and health; ,
sulphur acts directly on the liver, and
excretory organs and purifies and en- :
riches the blood by the prompt elimina- i
tion of waste material.
Our grandmothers knew this when
they dosed us with sulphur and mo- '
lasses every spring and fall, but the
crudity and impurity of ordinary flow- i
ers of sulphur were often worse than !
the disease, and cannot compare with
1 the modern concentrated preparations |
of sulphur, of which Stuart's Calcium
Wafers is undoubtedly the best and
most widely used.
They are the natural antidote for liv- j
er and kidney troubles and cure consti
pation and purify the' blood in a way
that often surprises patient and physi
cian alike.
Dr. R. M. Wilklns while experiment-
Ing with sulphur remedies soon found
that the sulphur from Calcium was su
perior to any other form. He says:
| "For liver, kidney and blood troubles,
; especially when resulting from consti
pation or malaria, I have been sur
prised at the results obtained from
Stuart's Calcium Wafers. In patients
suffering from boils and pimples and
even deep-seated carbuncles, I have re- I
peatedly seen them dry up and disap
pear in four or five days, leaving the
skin clear and smooth. Although Stu
art's Calcium Wafers is a proprietary
article, and sold by druggists, and for
that reason tabooed by many physi
cians, yet I know of nothing so safe
and reliable for constipation, liver and
kidney troubles and especially in all
forms of skin disease as this remedy." j
At feny rate people who are tired of
pills, cathartics and so-called blood 1
"purifiers," will find in Stuart's Cal- '
cium Wafers, a far safer, more pala- I
1 table and effective preparation.

were received by a guard of fifty police
and several officers and gendarmes.
The general lo6ked well and walked
with a stately step.
Preceded by a few police officers
and followed by his retinue, General
Stoessel slowly wended his way up the
hill to a prettily situated bungalow on
Inasa Hill, where he will be quartered.
Dozens of Russian officers, finding that
their late chief was arrived, ran up
from all directions and saluted in re
spectful silence. The party then en
tered the house.
The closing act of the drama caused
a feeling of sadness which was not
dispelled by the glorious weather,
beautiful surroundings and kind recep
tion accorded to the Russians by the
Japanese.
RAID COSTS COSSACKS DEARLY. |
More Than Three Hundred Lost In
Attack on Newchwang.
TOKIO, Jan. 14.âThe Japanese cas
ualties in the fighting with the Cos
sack raiders at the old town of New
chwang. Niuchiatun and other places
southwest of Liaoyang last Wednes
day were one man killed and fifteen
wounded. The Russian losses were
more than 300. The Japanese report
that the supplies of war munitions
stored at Newchwang and Niuchiatun
were not damaged.
GENERAL KURORTS HEAD
QUARTERS, Jan. 14.âA body of Rus
sian cavalry made a raid south this
week for the purpose of harassing
the Japanese lines of communication.
They occupied the old town of New
chwang, whose population is entirely
Chinese. On Thursday, Japanese in
fantry attacked the Russians and
drove them from the town. They left
fifty dead. One Japanese was killed.
The raiders, who crossed the Llao
River into neutral territory, are sup
posed to have numbered about 3000
men. There was some interruption of
railroad communication with the south
yesterday as a result of the raid, but
the damage was immediately repaired.
CAPTURED RIFLES USELESS.
CHEFU, Jan. 14.âMidshipman Kllso
rich, the Russian officer who com
manded a launch which reached here
from Port Arthur on January 3, in
commenting to-day upon General
Nogi's report of January 12, giving de
tails of the Russian property which
had been transferred to the Japanese
after the surrender of the fortress, said
that the 2,266,800 rounds of rifle am
munition, mentioned as among the
booty, were unloaded shells, relics of
the Chinese occupation of Port Arthur
and not fitted for use in Russian rifles.
The 82,670 large shells mentioned by
General Nogi, the midshipman said,
were also Chinese and were of no use
to the Russian artillery. Midshipman
Klisorlch further says that the locks
of the 35,252 rifles turned over to the
Japanese were broken before the for
tress capitulated.
Japanese who visited Port Arthur on
January 10 say that the Russian
wounded were in a terrible state, ow
ing to neglect, which could not be
avoided, when the Japanese entered
Port Arthur. Everything possible, they
say, is now being done for their relief.

would fall far short of recompensing
her for the humiliation occasioned bjr
appearing upon that witness stand- It
was the principle involved that inspired
her appeal to law. If a precedent were
established which might protect other
ladies from being deluded aa she had
been deluded by the defendant she
would be amply repaid for her vialt to
court.
"Needing a new bustle," continued
Miss Suryhue, settling her willowy
form as comfortably as possible In the
capacious witness chair and focusing
her rimless eyeglasses upon the bench,
"I called at Mr. Posner's store and told
a saleslady what I wanted. She showed
me a bustle, and 1 said it wasn't large
enoughâthat I had been wearing No. 2
size, Scott make, and no other style
would suit my shape. She saids the No.
2"s were out of fashion and out of stock,
because they were too large and there
was no demand for them. 'Well,' I said,
'I know what I want, and that thing
you are showing me is much too small
for my thin figure.' Then I purchased a
âa âcertain garment and took it home,
but mamma said it was much too large
for me, and I took it back to the store,
where the saleslady again showed me
the little bustle and induced me to take
it home and try it on. It made me look
ridiculous, of course, bo back I went
with it and told her so. She kept the
bustle and refused to return the 50
cents I had paid for it.
"I don't remember Just what I said
to her, but I distinctly recollect her
saying to me, as saucy as you please,
'What do/you want, anyway, a bustle
or a life-preserver?'
"While we were talking Mr. Posner
came up and told me to call around
i Tuesday and he would have a No. 2 for
me, but when I called on him Wednes
day he said he could not get one. He
wouldn't give up my 60 cents and I
had him arrested."
Mr. Posner, short, rotund and rosy,
disclaimed intent to defraud Miss Sury
hue. "I vud like ter dell you eferydings,
Shudge," he said, "only I'm a modest
man."
Assured that if his narrative threat
ened to depart from modesty's limit the
court would instantly apply a brake,
Mr. Posner resumed:
"Vy didn't she tell you abouid odder
dings she buyed at mine shtore? Vy
dldn'd she say dot der 50 cends vas in
clooded in der brice of derâderâ"
An appealing look at the Judge
brought forth the suggestion, "unmen
tionables."
"Dot vill doâder unmendionables.
Did she tell you abouid dot? Nein.
Did she say she buyed pads undâ"
"Ahem!" warningly coughed the
court.
"Veil, ve'll led id go at dot. But
meppy she'll say dot I didn't offer to
gif her a due bill fer dot 50 cends. Eh,
vat?"
"I didn't want a due bill, but a No.
2 bustle, for my fifty cents," Miss
Suryhue put in. warmly. "And you
might as well know right now that No.
2's are sold in every first-class store in
town. But what could one expect to
find In a little, measly "
"Dey're ovid of shtyle, dem No.
2's." Mr. Posner hotly contradicted.
The court suggested that Miss Sury
hue take fifty cents' worth of mer
chandise in lieu of the cash, but with
a withering glance at Mr. Posner the
lady declared: "I wouldn't be found
with anything that came out of his old
store." Nor was her facial expression
softened by the Judge's abrupt dismis
sal of the case.

PUTTING IT STRONG.
But Doesn't It Look Reasonable?
This may read as though we were
putting It a little strong, because it is
generally thought by the majority of
people that Dyspepsia In its chronic
form is incurable or practically so.
But we have long since shown that
Dyspepsia is curable, nor is it such
a difficult matter as at first appears.
The trouble with Dyspeptics is that
they are constantly dieting, starving
themselves or going to the opposite
extreme or else deluging the already
overburdened stomach with "bitters,"
"after dinner pills," etc., which in
variably increase the difficulty, even
If in some cases they do give a slight
temporary relief. Such treatment of
the stomach simply makes matters
worse. What the stomach wants is a
rest. Now how can the stomach be
come rested, recuperated and at the
same time the body nourished and
sustained?
This is a great secret and this is
also the secret of the uniform success
of Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. This is
a comparatively new remedy, but Its
success and popularity leave no donbt
as to its merit.
The Tablets will digest the food
anyway, regardless of condition of
stomach. The sufferer from Dyspep
sia, according to directions, is to eat
an abundance of good, wholesome
food and use the tablets before and
after each meal, and the result will
be that the food will be digested, no
matter how bad your Dyspepsia may
be, because, as before stated, the tab
lets will digest the food, even if the
stomach is wholly Inactive. To illus
trate our meaning plainly, If you take
1800 grains of meat, eggs or ordinary
food and place It in a temperature of
98 degrees and put with it one of Stu
art's Dyspepsia Tablets it will digest
the meat or egm almost as perfectly
as if the meat waa Inclosed within the
stomach.
The stomach may be ever so weak,
yet these tablets will perform the
work of digestion and the body and
brain will be properly nourished and
it the, same time a radical, lasting
sure of Dyspepsia will be made be
cause the much abused stomach will
be given, to some extent, a much
needed rest. Your druggist will tell
rou that of all the many remedies ad
vertised to cure Dyspepsia none of
them has given so complete and gen
eral satisfaction as Stuart's Dyspep
da Tablets, and not least in import
mce in these hard times is the fact
:hat they are also the cheapest and
rive the most good for the least
noney.

saying, "I received a letter from a
man in San Francisco saying that
Gignoux had called at the Palace Hotel
with two notorious characters and
taken my boy out to show him a good
time, and that afterward Gignoux
tried to compel my son to pay the bill
for the night's extravagant entertain
ment, but my son, in nervous frenzy,
threatened Gignoux with a beer bottle
and later, on his knees, agreed to pay
the bill himself. My son went West
to collect some money owed him by a
Colorado party and thence to the
Pacific Coast, thinking he might pos

have sent to the Palace Hotel a check
for his bill there, but must refuse to

TWO PARTNERS SAY THIRD
HAS FLED WITH MONEY
Complaint Alleges That M. Stolken
Disappeared With Funds Given
Hi in to Buy Merchandise.
The flight of M. Stolken, one of the
partners in a cigar and liquor business
at 1021 Folsom street, with $300 given
him to pay for goods, is alleged in a
complaint for accounting filed in the
Superior Court yesterday by P. Hagster
and Charles J. Anderson, the other
members of the firm. According to
their story, Hagster paid $850 for a
half interest in the business on No
vember 29, and four days later a third
interest was sold to Anderson for the
same sum. At that time It was repre
sented that there were no debts.
On December 1 Stolken is said to
have asked for $300 to buy goods and
to reimburse him for goods already
bought. The money was given him
and he disappeared and is now sup
posed to be in the southern part of the
State. The partners declare that they
have since been obliged to pay bills
aggregating $609 and that the assets
of the business are not more than
$1000.

Eight of Hearing Accord

City Attorney Long yesterday advised
the Police Commissioners that the pro

members of the Police Department trial

must be obeyed. Long quotes the sec
tions of the charter relative to the civil
service provisions regulating member
ship in the department and numerous
authorities to show that the charter
does not conflict with the constitution
on that point. The opinion continues:
"This settled policy of the law was
recognized and adopted by the charter
framers and made part of the charter
itself. The power to so provide was ex
pressly granted to the freeholders by
subdivision 3, section 8%, of the consti

view is strengthened by the case of
Elder vs. McDougald, No. 3820, decided
by the Supreme Court of the State Jan

Court after a lengthy and exhaustive
opinion affirms the right to provide in

sustained brthe court, and in my opin
ion this decision has great bearing upon
the charter provision here under dis
cussion.
"To take the department out of poll
tics and permit a member to do his
duty without fear of political disfavor
or the punishment of a commission act
ing in an arbitrary and capricious man
ner was the undoubted intention of the
people.
"Every city official should give to the
accomplishment of civil service his un
wavering support and honest effort,
and until the charter provisions affect
ing that branch of our city government
are declared invalid by the courts
should accept and abide by such provi
sions.
"To hold that provisions which are
declaratory of a common law right and
recognized as such by all text writers
and the courts of this country are un
constitutional, when the constitution
itself contains nothing which would in
dicate that such provisions are not
proper, would be unwarranted.
"Such a holding would be arf attack
upon civil service which would serious
ly cripple its work, and would tend to
place the members of the police and fire
departments at the mercy of the Com
missionersâa state of affairs that the
freeholders sought to avoid."

CASH RESERVE GREATLY
INCREASED DURING WEEK
Report of Associated Banks Reveals
Heavy Addition to Sains on
Deposit,
NEW YORK, Jan. 14âThe Financier
says: The most striking feature of the
official statement of the New York As
sociated Banks last week was the in
crease of more than $15,333,000 in the
cash reserve. This gain was not unex
pected, because it was shown by the
estimates of cash movements, which
were based upon the traceable changes
in money during last week. Moreover,
in the previous week there had been
a gain of $7,500,000, according to the es
timate of that week. The official re
turns showed a loss of $795,500. It was
regarded as probable, therefore, that
through the adjustment of bank aver
ages last week's official statement
would show quite an important gain of
cash. The increase as reported waa
$15,438,900, which was $5,750,000 below
the sum of the estimated gains for the
fortnight. After deducting from this
aggregate of $20,185,300, the net gain by
the banks for the period of $14,553,600 is
shown by the statement. The discrep
ancy of $5,666,000 may be partly ac
counted for by the system of bank
averages.
The deposits increased $9,991,500,
which amount very closely correspond
ed with the sum of the gain in cash
less the decrease in loans; therefore,
the statement showed a remarkably
good balance.
It is noteworthy that the legal tender
holdings of the banks are now $2,606 ; 600
in excess of the maximum of last year.
The reserve requirements against gen
eral deposits last week were $2,449,875,
deducting which sum from the gain in
cash as above left $12,851,025, as the in
crease in surplus reserves to $24,459,275.
At the corresponding date last year
this surplus was $23,181,700.

BRITISHER'S AMBITION.
BecomesCfiampion
Hustfer of Old
England.
LONDON, Jan. 14. âBy the pur-
I chase of the staid old Standard and
the hitherto miraculously dull Evening
I Standard, Cyril Arthur Pearson
, clinches his hold on the position of
being owner of more newspapers than
! any other man in the world. He like
; wise has more weekly and monthly
! periodicals than any one else. He has
been a newspaper man only four years,
:is only thirty-eight now, and where he
i will stop goodness only knows.
Pearson himself doesn't know. He
! says he had supposed he was content
before the chance to buy the Standard
suddenly popped into his path. His
! programme was to work like a Tro
; jan night and day for several months
to come getting the dignified but
somewhat gouty old Standard into
greater activity. Then he would dash
off somewhere and play Just as hard
as he worked; then, there was no tell
| ir.g what might happen,
j It was in the sanctum of the Stand
j ard, a severe, plainly furnished room
sacred to the memory of a line of dis
tinguished editors, that I had & re
markably frank and interesting inter
view with the new proprietor. His
; manner was as Jaunty as if he hadn't
a care in the world and never worked
more than two hours a day. But there
was no affectation of languor about
this young man, to whom Joseph
Chamberlain lately referred as the
greatest "hustler" he had ever known.
He was simple and direct, knew exact
ly what he wanted to say and how to
say it Quickest. I took along an expert
stenographer who said he had won a
medal for speed and could do 200
words a minute. He crept away from
that interview shaking his head sadly.
He had never heard before, he said,
of a man who could talk 300 words a
minute without wasting words.
When Pearson was asked to say if
he could tell, quickly, without stopping
to count, exactly how many periodicals
he owned, he said he thought so, but
when he tried to do it, he had to be
gin counting on his fingers.
ENORMOUS BUSINESS.
"Let's see," he said, "there are nine
daily newspapers, - four weekly news
papers and eightâor is it nine? âyes,
nine weekly periodicals, and six
monthly things. That is the list, I be
lieve, twenty-eight in all. And then
there is quite a considerable book
publishing business."
Of the newspapers in the Pearson
list, four âthe Standard, the Express,
the Evening Standard and the St.
James Gazette, are among the great
in London. His other papers
fare in cities outside* of London. Then
there is Pearson's Magazine, which has
one of the largest circulations In the
world, the Royal Magazine, the Ladies'
Magazine, the Rapid Review, Pear
son's Weekly, M. A. P., Home Notes
and all the other things that their
owner had to count up on his fingers.
"Did you ever stop," I asked him,
"tc figure out what it costs a month
to turn out all these periodicals?"
"That would be interesting, wouldn't
it? Must be something enormous. I
never figured it out, but I will as soon
as I; have time."
The story of Pearson's rise to sud
den power almost takes one's breath
away. It is the kind of thing that
happens sometimes in the United
States, but is not supposed to happen
in slower England. It began soon
after the Pearson boy had come out
of that historic public school, Win
chester.
Pearson pere was a country clergy
man, and was taking the finishing Of
i his boy's education in hand himself
when the youth amused his family one
day by announcing that he was going
i:i for a competition started for circu
lating-making purposes for a penny
weekly, called "Tit-Bits." Whoever
I turned in the best answers to a weekly
series of ten questions for thirteen
weeks was to have a Job on the staff
lof the paper at $10 a week âproviding
seemed likely to be worth the
money.
SLATED FOR MINISTRY.
"I was supposed to be going into the
church," said Pearson, when I talked
with him about this turning-point in
life. "My grandfather was a clergy
man. My father was a clergyman,
jMy father had five sisters, and four of
' them married' the curate ânot the
s?me curate! So, of course, I was sup
j posed to be going in for the church,
â¢ but I did not care for the idea. I Just
I happened U) hear of this competition
thing and went in for v because I had
I a great liking for general information,
; being of an inquiring turn of mind."
There were over 3000 competitors, and
the Pearson boy came out ahead with
414 marks, the next competitor getting
362. When he turned up at the office
of Tit-Bits he found that no special
work had been set apart for him other
than to draw his salary. It is significant
that he promptly found 'work for him
self. At the end of six months he had
acted as understudy to about every
body in the office and knew all the de
tails of management. Then the proprle-
I tor and the manager had a row,
i and who should turn up promptly with
ian application for the position but the
new clerk, who had Just celebrated his
nineteenth birthday?
"Sir George Newnes laughed at me,"
; said Pearson, "and was not even going
Ito listen to me, but I held on and told
j him that I meant it. 'Why,' said he,
j 'it's absurd for a boy to imagine he
can manage a business like this.'
" 'Well,' said L 'will you promise not
| to appoint anybody else for a while and
1 give me a chance at it for the mean
timer
j * 'No,' said he; T shall do nothing of
f the sort.'
"Just the same, he did not appoint a
j new manager, and I did the work with
out getting the appointment. Three
I months later I tackled him again and
said: Tf you are satisfied, I think it is
only fair to tell me so, and I will man
j age your business.' This time he i

thought so, too, and I was made man
ager."
"If I had not gone to America when
I was 24 years old I probably should
have been earning a salary of, say,
$5000 a year from George Newnes at
this moment. You do not know how
your life may turn out. I went over to
the United States for George Newnes
when I was getting a salary of $1500 a
year as manager of Tit-Bits. I came up
against men there about my own age,
and not noticeably more intelligent
than I was, who were either running
businesses for themselves or getting
very high salaries from other people.
That made me think, and when I got
back I tackled George Newnes and
said: 'This business is making $150,000
a year. I have been here for six years;
I think I ought to get something more.'
" 'How much?* said he.
"I said, "$2500 a year salary and a
slight percentage on all increase of
profits from to-day up.'
" 'No, I think not.'
" 'Very well; I must leave* you.'
" 'How soon?'
" 'Just as soon as convenient. I am in
no great hurry, but I must try for my
self.' And so I did.
"I lead a very methodical life, get
ting up at 7 o'clock and going to bed
at midnight, although on an average
I was up till about 4 for a number of
days after I first took over the Stand
ard. The first thing I do Is to read
some of my own papers. Fortunately
I can get over a column of type in
half the time that would be taken by
any one else I have ever come across.
I get through with the lot by a quar
ter to 8, and then I exercise until half
past, swinging my arms and legs
about âall that sort of thingâgood
hard work, getting up a good sweat.
A man comes to me every morning
and puts me through my paces. I need
a lot of exercise and have to take it
this way, in tabloid form. At half
past 8 I read more newspapers for a
quarter of an hour, then I have my
bath. After a very light breakfast
my secretaries come along with my

gerated Respect at Asylum
HUMORED BY ATTACHES
At Death of the Weak-Mind

by All the Forms of Royalty
DETMOLD, Principality of Lippe, |
Jan. 14.âPrince Carl Alexander of
Lippe-Detmold, who died yesterday in
the asylum at St. Gilgenberg, near!
Bayreuth, was surrounded by all the
forms of royalty, by gentlemen in wait- ,
ing and servants, who Bhowed him the
most exaggerated respect and kept up |
the illusion that he was indeed a sov
ereign. He took much pleasure in the
! maintenance of severe etiquette, read 1
; the newspaper daily and seemingly
: kept track of the world's affairs' and
j those of his own little principality, but
! he never permitted any one to speak of
them. He played chess often and was
fond of music and theatrical produc-
I tions.
The Prince was a calm-faced, hand
| some man, usually dressed in military
| uniform, and except for certain excess
fo stateliness gave no outward indica- j
tion that he was weak-minded. He j
lived, owing to his punctilous regard j
for hjs rank, in practically mental soli
tude", as it was unbecoming to him to
i exchange ideas with inferiors.
The succession to the principality of
Lippe-Detmold was in process of ad
justment by an arbitration court. The
death of Prince Alexander does not af
fetc the situation unless the Diet inter
poses.

MUSKOGEE, I. T., Jan. 14.âGeorge
Duncan, aged 18. an Indian boy ar
rested here on the charge of murder
ing John Brewer, a farmer, near Mel
vin, has made a full confession. He
lived with the Brewers and said he
was in love with Mrs. Brewer, al
though she is old enough to be his
mother.
Mrs. Brewer has also been arrested
as an accomplice She tried to shield
the boy, saying: "Some man called
Brewer to the door and shot him."

letters collected from all the different
places and I usually manage to go
through these by 10 o'clock. That
means that I have broken the back
of the day's routine and am free to
sort out the rest of the time accord
ing to circumstances.
LONG LUNCH HOUR.
"My one great rule is that the busier
I am the longer I take for lunch. It
is a -light lunch, but I take my time
aver a cigar after it. I am perfectly
certain that going directly back to
work after lunch is the thing to kill
you.
"This purchase of the Standard
came about by a pure fluke. I Just
happened to hear by accident that the
paper was for sale."
"And are you going to keep on ab
sorbing one paper after another until
you have a controlling voice in the
whole English press?"
"Oh, well," said Pearson, chuckling
non-eommittally, "there probably
would be two voices at any rate. There
is my old friend Harmsworth, you
know; he and his brothers between
them control a very large number of
publications."
It is never too late to do better.

Free From Any Suspicion
ST. LOUIS, Jan. 14.âThe investigat
ing committee of the Missouri House
of Representatives sent to St. Louis to
determine the source and nature of the
$21,000 contribution to the Republican
State campaign fund officially credited
to Thomas K. Niednnghaus. who waa
chairman of the Republican State Cen
tral Committee and is now caucus nom
inee for United States Senator, ad
journed to-night, to meet in Jefferson
City Monday afternoon. The Senate
committee did not its investi
gations to-day. According to the state
ment of the Republican members of
the House committee, who constitute
the majority, the committee will report
that its Investigations have found noth
ing to substantiate Representative
Grace's charge that brewers contribu
ted money during the campaign to in
fluence legislation.
During the day the House committee
heard the testimony of Adoplhus Busch
and Otto Stifel, wealthy brewers; E. C.
Brokmeyer, who was Chairman Nled
ringhaus' confidential secretary, and a
number of other witnesses.
Adolphus Busch and Otto Stifel told
practically the same story regarding
the $21,000 contribution to the Republi
can State campaign fund as waa told
to the committee last night by Chair
man Niedringhaus. They said, as he
had said, that their contribution was
a guarantee to meet a deficit, and en
tailed no promise of legislative favor
for their business interests.
Otto Stifel in every way corroborated
the testimony of Adolphus Busch. "I
have not yet paid the amount I guar
anteed," he said, "but I shall do so 11 I
am called on."
In answer to a question he declared
he had contributed to the fund for the
city as well as for the State campaign,
giving $1000 before and $1000 after the
election.
According to the Republican mem
bers of the committee, who are In the
majority, the report will Include the
stenographer's transcript of the testi
mony taken at the sessions, and will
conclude with the statement that the
committee found nothing to substan
tiate the charge of Representative
Grace that the money was given by
brewers for the purpose of influencing
legislation.

In the afternoon Dr. J. A. Black,
who is the singer's physician, advised
the lady that it would be better for
her not to attempt the part as her
cold was somewhat worse. All dur
ing the day Tetrazzini suffered consid
erably with her throat and Dr. Black
said that it would be exceedingly un
wise in her to use it in the difficult
part that she was to portray.
The Tivoli management offered to
refujpd money paid for seats or to
exchange the tickets for Tuesday
night, by which time it Is thought
Tetrazzini will be in trim to sing. Near

A DESERVED TESTIMONIAL
From an Old Los Angeles Friend to the
Wonderful Skill and Successful
Treatments of Cancer by
Dr. S. B. Chamley.
This Is an age of specialists in every line of business and every profession,
and of the latter, especially, in the medical profession. The olden time doctor
was supposed to be a "cure-all." and if he failed to discover the particular mal
ady that afflicted his patients, he bled them, and sometimes so freely as to en
danger the lives of victims of his ignorant but time-honored method of treat
ment.
Medical science has progressd by leaps and bounds, however, during the
past thirty years, and the successful medical practitioner of to-day is a special
ist, not a "cure-all," for it requires a great many years' study of even one class
of disease, under the modern system, in order to become an expert in its cure.
Among the maladies that human flesh is heir to, and unfortunately increas
ing in number of cases and malignancy, is cancer, that dread disease which
comes on so insidiously and in a great many instances *nds fatally on account
of the Ignorance and stupidity of mnny medical practitioners who attempt to
cure it by surgical operation. Even when the opera tion is performed by the most
[â¢skillful surgeon there frequently remains seme part of the horrid growth-which
j will grow again and ultimately destroy life unless the case is entrusted to a
' specialist who thoroughly understands cancer and the rational method of cur
| ing lt.
Probably the most skillful and successful cancer specialist on the Pacific
1 Coast is Dr. S. R. Chamley, principal of the Chamley Cancer Institute, 25 Third
Street. San Francisco, where he has a large staff of assistants. He graduated in
1884 from the Keokuk. lowa. Cpllege of Physicians and Surgeons, one of the
oldest and best west of the Mississippi River. Having decided to become a cancel
specialist on account of the terrible ravages of that dread and. at that time, but
little understood disease. Dr. Chamley's special course of study during his col
lege term was. and in fact ever since has been, that of "cancer in all its charac
teristics and how to cure it."
Immediately after graduating from college Dr. Chamley commenced his ca
reer as a cancer specialist in St. Louis. Missouri. In 1S8!Â» he removed to Los
Angeles, being a raddly growing city and the Mecca of a large number of health
seekers and sufferers from special diseases. The writer was at that time one of
the stockholders and business manager of the Evening Express Company of Los
Angeles, and became well acquainted with Dr. Chamley. which acquaintance soon
ripened into a warm friendship, for the stalwart, generous-hearted physician had
a happy faculty then, as now, of making friends. Mr.ny an article denouncing the
knife treatment of cancer and strenuously advocating a purely vegetable treatment
as a sure cure in every case, if taken hola of in time, found gratuitous insertion in
the Evening Express, and although ridiculed and laughed to scorn by most of
i the surgeons, the young doctor's practice steadily increased. The writer recalls.
j moreover, many instances of cases undertaken and cure* effected free of charge,
when the patient was unable to pay. When Dr. Chamley removed to San Fran
cisco in 1807 in order to secure a larger fi>lrt for his vapidly growing practice,
the writer believed that he was making a mistake, but it is gratifying to observe
that besides extending his field of operations in San Francisco to all parts of the
Pacific Coast, and even to the Eastern States. Dr. Chamley has retained a strong
hold on his former field, as shown byâ¢ hundreds of testimonials gratuitously ten
dered him by Southern California patients during the past five years.
The writer called on the doctor this week to renew the old acquaintance
after several years' interruption, and duiing the long wait on account of the many
patients being treated, a gentleman with a bandaged face, who was a total stran
ger to the writer, came in to see Dr. Chamley. A few minutes' conversation elic
ited the following facts: The gentleman was Mr. B. F. Stone of Los Angeles, who
is being successfully treated for cancer on the face, near the left eye. His opin
ion of Dr. Chamley was tersely expressed in the following remark: "I became a
patient of the doctor's after trying many other so-called 'cancer specialists.' but
I have ten times the faith in Dr. Chamley that I ever had In any other doctor, for
I firmly believe he has cured me."
A treatise by Dr. Chamley of over One pages, thoroughly covering
the subject of cancers and tumors, is given or mailed gratuitously by the Cham
ley Cancer Institute on application to 25 Third Street. San Francisco. This is an
invaluable book that every family should possess. Dr. Chamley. Is duly registered
as a practicing physician in many other States besides California, and it is a
noteworthy fact that he is highly regarded and recommended by the most promi
nent and intelligent in the United States, who marvel nt tho 3000 cures
of cancer effected by this diatinimionori Â«Â« o Â«iân** v-if e or n*Jn.

BORE VICTIMS
OF BOLD THUGS
H. E. 3letzer, Sailor, Fol
lowed by Four Men From a
Saloon, Beaten and Bobbed
TAKEN TO A HOSPITAL
E. W: Purcell, Engineer at a
Sugar Refinery, Throttled
and Believed of His Watch
Two holdups were reported to the po
lice early yesterday morning and so
far no trace cf the footpads has been
found. H. E. Metzer v a sailox, living
at 222 Pacific street, went into the "M.
and M." saloon at 231 Kearny street
shortly before 3 o'clock. Four men
were standing at the bar and a dispute
arose. It got so personal that Metzer
i left. He walked along Kearny street in
j the direction of Sutter and observed
that the four men were follow
ing him. Just as he reached
Sutter street he was struck
on the head from behind with some
J blunt instrument and knocked uncon
: Bcious. When he recovered he found
j that his gold watch, chain and locket
I valued at about $50 had been stolen.
!He notified.Policeman Teutenberg, who
! went with him to the saloon, but the
; bartender declared the four men were
j strangers to him. Metzer was sent to
j the Central Emergency Hospital, where
j a wound in his scalp was dressed.
E. W. Purcell, 3826 Twenty-second
street, who Is engineer at the works
â¢of the Long Syrup Refining Company,
I Eighth and Brannan streets, was held
iup by a lone footpad about 6 o'clock
j yesterday morning while he was on his
way to work. He had almost reached
; the works when a man who came to
; ward him grabbed him by the throat,
i threw him down and took $11 in coin
'â  and a gold watch valued at $40 from
j him. The attack was so unexpected
that Purcell had no time to raise an
i alarm when the footpad disappeared in
! the darkness. It was so dark at the
J time of the robbery that Pur
i cell was unable to give a de
scription of the robber except
' that he was about 5 feet 6 or 7 inches
tall. The crime was a bold one, as at
that time there are many men going j
'to work in that locality, including Mc- i
Nab & Smith's teamsters. Detectives
| Regan and O'Connell are working on ;
i the case.

ognizes Photo of Prisoner
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.âThe pho
tograph of Gessler Rosseau, who was 1
.'arrested In Philadelphia for carrying
an infernal machine, has been identified
' .by three persons here as that of the
â¢ man who placed a bomb on the fence
. surrounding the statue of Frederick the
:â  :Great.
â¢; NEW YORK, Jan. 14.âInspector Me-
Cluskey of the detective bureau said
"'â¢ '.to-.day that a picture of Gessler Ros
. "seau, the man arrested in Philadelphia
' -yesterday, carrying an infernal ma
â  QhJtne; was an excellent likeness of the
â¢ man wanted by the police department
"frr 'attempting to blowup the Cunarder
, -Umbria in May, 1903. The Umbria sus
â¢ :,pect Just prior to the attempt to blow
â¢up- the liner boarded with a woman
â¢ named Mrs. Murray, and Inspector Mc
â Cluakey said to-day that Mrs. Murray
/'had identified the photograph of the
. .man under arrest at Philadelphia as a
â¢likeness of her former boarder.
"' 'Late to-day Inspector McCluskey
-.'said' that Peter Bathe, the expressman
.. who took the box containing the infer
â¢ nal machine to the Cunard line dock in
May, 1903, positively identified the
â¢ picture of Rosseau as that of the man
. ho employed him to carry the box to
â¢ the dock.
The inspector said he expected to ob
:tain a warrant for Rosseau based on
', Evidence in his possession.
Captain Donaghy is confidently ex- ,
pectlng to hear from the Denver au- j
. th.orltieÃ that Rosseau is known there. '
â¢ His reason for believing this is that
â¢ Boaaeau wore a hat made by a Denver
ihm.
: Rosseau's coolness and nerve do not
â¢desert him. He sits quietly in his cell
.and never complains. He. was very
â¢anxious to get the morning news
papers,, but these were refused him.
He is a man of more than average in
telligence and education. His answers
are civil, but dignified and firm, and
."he cannot be induced to answer a
'â¢ single question about nlmself.
"I made a mistake," he said to Cap
tnin Donaghy to-day, "but I have
:nothing further to say. If you want
â¢'-to know anything about me you will
..have'to find it out for yourself. I
â¢ can't help you."

PRISON DIRECTORS HOLD
MEETING AT SAN QUENTIN
Board Decides to Recommend Six
Man Slayers to Governor Pardee
for Parole.
SAN RAFAEL, Jan. 14.âThe regu
lar meeting of the State Board of
Prison Directors was held to-day at'
San Quentin. At the open session a
report was read from Warden Tomp
kins regarding the light and power
furnished the prison during the last six
months. The report shows that work
in the Jute mill had to be suspended
sixty-five hours during that period ow
ing to lack of power. Senator Felton
offered a resolution that no bills be
paid to the Light and Gas Company
until the matter has been adjusted.
The Warden was ordered to adver
tise for bids for 500 bales of hay.
A resolution was passed directing
the Warden to become personally fa
miliar with the work performed by the
prisoners, to observe the manner in
which the officers and guards perform
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 15, 1905.
their duties and to observe the prison
ers in the dining room.
He was also directed to spend at
least three hours of each working day
inside the prison.
At the executive session a report was
read from the machine shop showing
a saving of $1000 during the last six
months by having work done by the
convicts.
Senator Devlin was elected chairman
of the board for the ensuing year.
The following prisoners were recom

Made on Jurist.
SANTA CRUZ, Jan. 14.âAt a meet
ing of the Veteran Soldiers' and Sail
ors' Club of Santa Cruz County held in
this city a few /lays ago resolutions
were adopted denouncing in the bitter
est terms the persons who recently
made charges in Sacramento reflecting
upon the reputation and judicial integ
rity of Judge Lucas F. Smith, who is
now serving his ninth year as Judge of
the Superior Court of this county. The
members of the club recognize Judge
Smith as an able and incorruptible
member of the bench, and declare in
the resolutions adopted that a cowardly
attempt is being made to injure his rep
utation as a jurist and to belittle him
as a citizen. They furthermore declare
that he has ably, honorably and faith
fully performed the duties of his high
office.

BARRIE'S DRAMA
i CLEVER FLAY
"Peter Pan: or the Boy Who
Wouldn't Grow Up," Scores
Hit With Theater Goers
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Jan. 14.â J. M. Barries
latest play, "Peter Pan; or The Boy
Who Wouldn't Grow Up," will get
across to the United States presently.
There is no doubt about that. The
dramaâif you call it a dramaâwhich
was produced at the Duke of York's
Theater this week under the Frohman
management. Is even more fantastical
and whimsical than "The Admirable
Crichton" or "Little Mary," and, by
the same token, so much further re
moved from anything that ever was
seen on the stage before. Perhaps If
could best be described as a Christmas
pantomime, plus literary genius.
One might suppose frr>m the title that
the play was taken from the chapter
devoted to "Peter Pan" in Barries
latest book, "The Little White Bird";
but the original idea only serves as a
point of departure. Peter, lt appears,
ran away from home the day after he
was horn upon hearing his father spec
ulate as to what he was to be when

ne grew up. Peter decided then and
there that he didn't want to grow up:
so he fled to the Never-Never-Never
Mind and became the captain of Boys
Who Had Fallen Out of Their Per
ambulators When Their Nurses Were
looking the Other Way. There were
no girls in the community, because, as
Peter subsequently explained, girls are
too clever to fall out of their perambu
latorsâwhich is English for baby car
riages. This jolly band of boys de
cided that all it needed was a mother,
so their chieftain invades the nursery
of Miss Wendy Moira Angela Darling,
aged perhaps 12, and persuades her.
with her two small brothers, to fly
away with him and be a mother to
the boys. It never would have hap
pened if the father of these three de
lightful children had not become an
noyed with Nana and chained her up
outside the house instead of leaving
her, as usual, in the nursery to guard
the children, warm their pajamas, give
them their medicine and superintend
their baths. Nana, it may be observed,
is a dogâsuch nn engaging beast as
never war on sea or land outside of
Barries imagination.
There is no space here to detail the
tremendous adventures of Miss Wendy
Moira Angela Darling and her small
brothers in the company of Peter Pan
and his fascinating boys in their un
derground abode. They survive such
perils at: wolves, Indians who are suit
ably wild and the wickedest of pi
rates, and at last bethink themselves
that their mothers may be missing
them and return home, where all ends
well.
Any one who has read "The Little
White Bird" will know with what de
licious touches the author has shown
that he himself is a boy who has never
quite grown up. At every turn there is
humor that is akin to tears.
William Nicholson, perhaps the most
original and Ingenious of British
artists, designed the costumes and
much of the scenery, especially the nur
sery in the first act, with Its walls
completely covered with pictures cut
from posters and many other quaint
devices.' Gerald dv Maurier, worthy
son of a worthy father, appears in
Peter Pan as the husband of Dorothea
Baird, who has been seen rarely on the
stage since she captured London 'oy
her impersonation of the senior Dv
Maurier's Trilby. The part of Peter
Pan was assigned to Nina
who also had the principal role in Bar
ries last previous play. "Little Mary."
It Is said that English composers of
light opera are "sore" on American
songs. Several'of them, one hears, have
consented to supply the scores of forth
coming musical plays only on condition
that no trans-Atlantic melodies are
"dropped into" these productions, their
argument being that when pieces with
American songs in them are successful
the alien ditties get most of the credit
for the success. There is something in
this, but there is a suggestion, too, of
cutting off one's nose to spite one's
face. For no one will deny that "Bede
-11a" was the most taking feature of
"The Orchid." "My Cozy Corner Girl"
that of "The Earl and the Girl" and
"Sammy" that of "The Love Birds."
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 15. 1905.
â  And the rule worked again at Wynd
ham's Theater recently, when a first
j night audience listened indulgently to
â  the melodious score of a new Irish light
: opera, but applauded to the echo two
I songs from across the water which
j had bef*n interpolated. The piece in
| question was 'Teggy Machree," which

Written by Patrick Bidwell, with
I music by Michale Esposito, it is a
; pleasing trifle enoughâall about the
I affairs of a handsome young Irishman
j and hi.; sweetheart, and in the ordinary
j course probably would have attracted
London audiences for about a month.
; But the two American songs, given to
i Marie Daintonâwho is Peggyâmay
â  make all the difference. They are "Hon

BERLIN. Jan. 14.âNot content with
the well-deserved reputation of pos
sessing the best schools of all kinds
in Europe, Germany is continually
seeking improved methods and under
taking educational experiments with
a view to making learning attractive
to the young and increasing their ca
pacity for absorbing knowledge. One
of the most interesting and unique re
sults is the institution established by
the scholastic authorities of Oharlot
ter.burg, that enterprising suburb of
Berlin which aepires to the distinction
of being called a sister city of the
capital.
On the tst of August the visitor who
chances to be an early riser sees a
pretty profession. At first glance it
would appear to be merely a band of
r-hildren.pressir.gwith hurried steps out
of the stifling town, their faces bright
with anticipations. The girls carry
garlands of flowers; the boys bear ban
ner?, and they are all singing one of
those quaint part songs which nr-> so
popular in <>rmaiiy. Their aspect is
so joyous that they are evidently ex
pecting some delightfunl treat. The
natural conclusion of the stranger is
that it is a children's picnic. But an
inquiry addressed to the first citizen he
meets will show him to be wrong. He
will bo told, with a certain amount of
rrlde and satisfaction-for Charlotten
burgers are all proud of their municipal
"goaheaditiveness"âthat the chil
dren are going off to the forest school,
which opens on the Ist of August. A
"forest school" has such an original
sound, and the mere term calls up to
the imagination such delightful
possibilities that it immediately
prompts further inquiry and investiga
tion. Then lt Is learned that the au
thorities of this fierman townâkeen
as are all their compatriots concerning
educationâhave provided a new path
to knowledge. Recognizing that in
long, hot summer days children coop-
F-d up in close, stuffy rooms get drowsy
und stupid, they have determined that i
their youngsters shall learn In the
fresh and invigorating open air.
When a Herman thinks of taking a
day's pleasure in summer he general
ly hies him to the woods, and it is to
Lhe woods near Charlottenburg that
this educational department turned
when it sought a rural schoolroom.
There amid green leafy isles the forest
Echool has been established, and there
certain of the little ones of the com
munal schools go every day for instruc
tion. It is intended for the benefit of
those children who are so delicate â
either from inherited weakness, ner
vousn-ss. anaemia or want of nour
ishmentâthat they are unable to keep
up in the race for knowledge with their
stronger companions or to profit to the
full by the regular routine of ordinary
school life.

Millions of people, of nine different 1
nations, are constant users of Liquo- j

some to keep well. Some to cure
germ diseases; some as a tonic. No ;
medicine was ever so widely em

your neighbors and friends are among
them. And half the people you meet
âwherever you areâ know some one
whom Liquozone has cured.
If you need help, please ask some of j
these users what Liquozone does, j

thousands of difficult cases, that
Liquozone destroys the cause of any
germ disease.
Liquozone has, for more than 20
years, been the constant subject of
scientific and chemical research. It is
not made by compounding drugs, nor
with alcohol. Its virtues are derived
solely from gasâlargely oxygen gasâ

lessons seem to lose half their terrors
when learnt out in the open air.
Gymnastics are freely taught, as well
as botany, and indeed all kinds of sub
jects connected with country life.
Two hours and a half a day are de
voted to the lessons actually necessary
for passing the various educational
standards, and in chill or wet weather
these are given in the school house,
which is carefully arranged for light
and air.
Immediately on arrival in the woods
the pupils are given each a pint of
milk and bread and butter, or a plate
of oatmeal porridge. For dinner, al
ways eaten early, there is a good soup,
meat and vegetables, and one of the
amusements of the children is to play
at housekeeping and assist at prepar
ing dUiner. in which they are naturally
encouraged.
After dinner the little ones seek the
shady clearing where a siesta is taken,
nil kinds of comfortable folding chairs
being provided with warm rugs, and
here they doze and rest their appointed

Liquozoneâlike excess of oxygenâis

There lies the great value of Liquo

germs is a poison and it cannot be

These are the known germ diseases.
All that medicine can do for these

when the germs which cause a disease
are destroyed the disease must end,
and forever. That is inevitable:

ARE INTRODUCED

Revision of the State Consti
tution Will Be Taken Up
by This Legislature and
the Defects Corrected
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAC RAMENTO, Jan. 14.âWith the
greater part of his flock scattered in
various directions throughout the State,
Speaker Prescott of the Assembly is
still in Sacramento, hard at work. It [
is not legislation alone, though, that is
occupying Prescott. The charges made
against him by certain of his constitu
ante of San Bernardino County that he ,
had proven traitor to them and false
to his pledges by throwing his support
to Flint instead of Bard in the United
States Senatorship fight are rankling
within him and he is not' going to quit
without a fling back The bones of San i
Bernardino politics are rattling under ;
this fight and it will be many a day be
fore it ceases to come to the surface in
some shape. Speaker Prescott has kept |
to his room most of to-day preparing
a document that he thinks will shake
up his accusers in the southland.
"Do you think I am going to lie down
under all these accusations?" he asked
in speaking of the reply he was about
to send. His tone left no doubt that his
desires were to hand his opponents a
document that would wither them.
"I am something of a fighter myself
and I will not allow myself to be
abused when 1 do not merit it. I was
left free to vote as I wanted to in case
just such an emergency as developed
should arise. I've won out on every
thing yet and you'll see me on top right
along."
Revision of the State constitution
will be prominent before this Legisla
ture. Under this instrument as it
â  stands the tax legislation proposed by
the Governor will be difficult and it is
supposed that he will favor a conven
tion to renovate the State's organic
law. Assemblyman Goodrich, who in
troduced a concurrent resolution that
forms the first step toward calling such
a convention, said to-day:
DEFECTS IX CONSTITUTION.
"There are many defects in the con
stitution of the State. It is too long
for one thing. It contains too many
provisions and tries to cover too much
ground. Amendments are being con
stantly introduced by members of the
Legislature until the constitution is be
coming a cumbersome instrument and
very different from what a State con
stltutfbn should beâa terse document
covering vital points and free from
complexity. Many of the amendments
â¢ that have been added to it have been
carelessly prepared and passed without
proper scrutiny. A number of them
have been introduced, not because the
authors thought they were particularly
wise, but because their*constituents de
manded it for some local reason. New
York revises her constitution every
twenty years. Ours has stood with con
stant accumulation of amendments for
twenty-five years."
The prison bills introduced by As
semblyman McKenney are to receive
the especial support of Speaker Pres
cott. The Speaker has great confidence
in McKenney's ability to frame meas
. ures that will reach the existing evils.
Prescott's aid will help obtain the ap
propriations asked for to begin carry
ing out the new plans if the Legisla
ture passes the bills, and the beginning
of a complete change in California's
penal methods will very likely take

below:
"I have been feeling so good I could
hardly believe it, after suffeiing with
piles for a year, to find that I am once
more feeling like myself. I wish you
could have seen me before I started
using Pyramid Pile Cure and look at
me now, and you would say I am not
the same man. I have gained twenty
pounds, and all on account of Pyramid
Pile Cure." Walter Sharkley, 56 Park
St., Springfield, Mass.
"I bought a 50 cent box of Pyramid
Pile Cure and used as directed with the
most unexpected results, a complete
cure. I have been troubled with piles
for thirty years and was in much dis
tress and passed much blood, but at
present am free from any kind of
piles." F. McKay, Weaverville, Cal.
"'Pyramid Pile Cure has been worth
thousands of dollars to me; it cured me
after using numbers of other remedies
and taking medicines from doctors. It
also cured my son, although he could
hardly walk, eat or sleep; he is now all
right." B. Stringfellow, Postmaster,
Elko. 8. C.
One thousand dollars is offered by
the Pyramid Drug Co., Marshall, Mich.,

Pyramid Pile Cure is sold by drug

place soon unless some unexpected and
powerful opposition develops to the
measures suggested.
The California Anti-Compulsory Vac- ;
cination League with headquarters at
Berkeley is going to make the fight in
favor of the anti-vaccination bills that
have been introduced and the medical
boards of the State will find it neces- ,
sary to send a lobby to protect the ex- j
isting law that stands in the way of j
smallpox making ravages among .
school children. The Berkeley society
has had W. T. Baxley here as its agent
and he has attended to the bills that
are intended to strike the blow at the
use of vaccine.
ANTI-VACCINATION FIGHT.
The State Board and City Boards of
Health will doubtless be able to pre
vent the passage of the anti-vaccina
tion bills, but the fight will come up at
every Legislature, as there are many
people who believe that vaccination is
dangerous and that it is not a preven
tive of smallpox, notwithstanding
the fact that the government of every
civilized nation recognizes it as effi
cient and vaccinates its soldiers.
Through Assemblyman Jones of Tou
lumne, the cattlemen who were wont
to run their herds on what is now the
national forest reserve near the Yo
semite Valley will try to obtain the
privilege to again use the reserve for
grazing purposes. Jones will Intro
duce a concurrent resolution asking for
a Legislative committee to investigate
on behalf of the cattlemen the condi
tions existing and make a report to
the Government. At present some of
the cattle-owners have to get a Gov
ernment permit to drive over the re
serve to reach patented land owned by
them.
The new school fund apportionment
bill has finally been introduced in the
Assembly with the apportionment
based on the number of teachers em
ployed and the amount for each teach
er fixed at $300. Under this San Fran
cisco would receive $649,530 26, as
against an apportionment of $865,
--425 42 last year under the pupil per
capita scheme, a difference of more
than $200,000 that the metropolis will
have to make up by taxation if the
bill becomes a law. Many of the coun
try members are opposed to the new
bill as they believe apportionment
should be based on the number of pu
pils.
While questions of greater moment
will come before the Legislature at this
session it is safe to say that none will
occupy more time than those relating
to the protection of the game birds
of the State, the destruction of its
birds of prey, the conservation of its
feathered songsters and the annihila
tion of its winged myriads of mosqui
toes that are neither birds nor beasts. (
To pass with the mosquitoes into the
realm of extinct creatures of the earth
are bluejays, crows and hawks, which,
it is claimed, destroy more game than
all the gunners that sweep marsh and
mountain with their leaden hail. This
is the verdict of the legislative com
mittee of the State Fish and Game As
sociation, which held a meeting here a
few days ago to consider what meas
ures should be adopted in line with the
purposes of the organization.
The. association first took up the
question of the extermination of blue
jays and crows. It was stated by sev
eral experienced members of the asso
ciation that these birds eat the eggs
of the quail and other game birds and
prevent their propagation. The Legis
lature will be asked to place a bounty
of 2V& cents on these birds and in ad
dition the association will fight every
measure providing for the protection of
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 15, 1905.
fish and game destroying birds as pro
posed by the Audubon Society. Pend
ing the action of the Legislature on
these questions, however, the game as
sociation has decided to go to work on
its own account to carry out its ideas
and In a few days Sacramento will see
one of the biggest hunting expeditions
ln its history.
WAR ON THE CROWS.
The members of the association will
divide into two bodies and go on Jay
and crow shooting trips, the losers to
provide a banquet for all hands. It Is
expected that several hundred at least
of these pests will be sent to their last
rest as a result of the trip, and even
should the Audubon Society be suc
cessful ln carrying through any of Its
proposed measures the feathered pests
of Sacramento County will be largely
decreased before such measures can
be finally passed upon.
The legislative committee of the as
sociation was also instructed to com
bat every measure advocated by the
State Sportsmen's Association looking
to the curtailment of the shooting sea
son, non-sale of ducks and the reduc
tion of the bag limit on ducks. The as
sociation was assured that it would
not meet with special opposition from
the State Game and Fish Commission.
Game Warden Neale informed the as
sociation ' that the State commission
was not against the views of the as
sociation, but that the southern sports
men were. In fact, he said, the State
commission was ln accord in the
main with the association's views, and
even had in preparation a bill which
would allow it to license restaurant,
market and wholesale men and permit
them to have ln their possession more
than fifty ducks at one time, pro
viding, however, that they did not pur
chase more than fifty birds from any
one market hunter on any one day.
After some discussion the association
agreed to support this bill when it is
presented for the consideration of the
Legislature.
While it has nothing to do with the
questions that are bothering the many
game associations of the State, the
bill providing for the division of the
State into mosquito districts is Inter
esting the legislators. Instead of with
gun or rod these pests will be hunt
ed to their doom by men armed with
coal oil cans. The State will be plat
ted out and- mosquito wardens appoint
ed to wage battle in each of the sev
eral districts. Coal oil will be spread
on the still waters of the State's
marshes, and the sound of the strang
ling larvae will be the knell of the
living pests that pass around malaria
and other diseases without eclat or
ceremony.

GETTING READY
FOR HIS TRIAL
Young Weber Wants Copy of
the Statement Made by Him
to the Auburn Authorities
AUBURN, Jan. 14.âAdolph Weber
was taken into court this morning on
motion of his counsel, who asked for
an order directing the District Attor
ney to give him a statement of the evi
dence taken prior to the preliminary
examination on the morning after the
murder. Adolph- Weber was taken
into the back room of the Sheriff's
office and questioned by the Sheriff
and District Attorney. The latch of
the outer door accidentally caught and
Attorney Tabor could not get in the
room.
A heated argument with the District
Attorney ensued over the request for
the order for the testimony and the
court threatened to fine Attorney
Tabor if he did not desist. After the
argument had been concluded the
Judge said he would look up the law
and would grant the request 'If he
could find any law warranting the
Court in making the desired order.
WILL PROBABLY NOT
RETURN TO DFvTSION
If General Mac Arthur Goes to Orient
He Will Report From There
to Washington.
General Mac Arthur has as yet re
ceived no official notification of his
being - sent to take observations on the
war in the Far East. If the war con
tinues for a considerable time and
General Mac Arthur goes to the scene
of conflict he will in all probability
remain there for an indefinite period.
His command here will doubtless be
filled by a new official, and at the
conclusion of his observations at the
seat of war General Mac Arthur will
report directly to Washington. From
present indications it would appear
that the general will not return to
this post.
General Francis Moore, department
commander, who has been making a
tour of inspection of the post at Hon
olulu, is expected to return to the Pre
sidio about January 23. He will come
up on the steamship Sonoma. This
will give him plenty of time to con
fer with General Mac Arthur regard
ing duties here during the latter's ab
sence.
Dr. John D. Tost U. S. A., will
leave for his new post at Honolulu on
January 25, taking passage on the
transport Sheridan. The Sheridan
will only take first class passengers,
as all her available room will be util
ized for freight.
The Twenty-first Infantry will sail
for the Philippines on the transport
Sherman, leaving here February 1.
The Sherman will also take one com
pany of the< signal corps and 20Â© re

The Eighteenth Infantry, which has
been stationed in the Philippines for
the last two years, sailed for home
yesterday on the transport Logan.

who was Nettle Hawkins when she
married Runge on October 4 last, filed
a suit for divorce, repeating all the
allegations of cruelty contained in the
ccunter-charge to her husband's for
mer suit. His chief complaint waa
that she told him that she did not love
him and treated him unkindly. She
declares that he abused her at St,
Louis when they visited the fair and
that on October 30 when she tried to
leave him in the Occidental Hotel ln
this city he threatened to shoot her.
She renews her statement that he is
worth between $50,000 and $100,000
and has an income of $10,000 a year,
besides money ln bank. She demands
$250 a month alimony and $1000 for
her attorney. Runge denied that he
was worth the sum named and said
that his only mining interest was in
an undeveloped and unproductive
claim at Tonopah.

oo NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA w
NIGHT IN JAIL
FOR A SENIOR
University Student Spends
Time Behind Bars Instead
of Attending the Theater
FRIENDS HELP HIM OUT
Sequel to Attempt of Youth
to Hypothecate a Type
writer He Had Borrowed
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call.
2148 Center Street. Jan. 14.
Friends came this morning to the res
cue of William Craig Martin, a student
ln the college of Social Sciences at the
State University, who was arrested last
night for pawning a typewriter he had
rented from an agency in San Francis
co, and he was released from the Coun
ty Jail in Oakland. Representations
were made to the typewriter people
which convinced them that Martin was
not deserving of prosecution. Payment
of the sum due on the typewriter was
made, and Martin returned to his home
at Blake street in Berkeley.
When found by Deputy Marshal
Howard last night the youth was dress
ing to attend a theater with a "co-ed"
of his acquaintance, and expressed dis
gust when told that the dressing opera
tion would have to be postponed. He
refused to discuss the affair at the
County Jail, where he spent the night.
Martin is the sop of a Presbyterian
minister, who came from England six
years ago, and is now living at Santa
Kosa. The son is a senior at the uni
versity, where his career has been
variegated and picturesque. His most
recent escape was that for which Dr.
Moore, a woman physician of Berkeley,
charged him with having sent bogus
telephone messages to her office at mid
night, teiling her to come and attend
his wife, who required the services of a
physician instantly.
Dr. Moore sallied forth on receiving
the call, and after inquiring at the ad
dress given her, was told that no wom
an lived there who required a doctor's
services. Three times Dr. Moore an
swered the fake messages, each time
with the same result. She traced the
tails to Martin's room, as she alleged,
and demanded he settle the mat
ter by paying her the regular fee.

2148 Center Street, Jan. 14.
! Escaping gas from mains that were
' cut by firemen while attempting to
j save the home of Mrs. Alice S. Smith
,at 2238 Atherton street this morning
j rendered the Fire Department's task so
; hazardous that a half dozen robust fire
fighters were forced to leave the build
â  me to avoid asphyxiation.
Chief Kenny declared the fire was
| one of the most remarkable, in some
respects, that he had ever seen, or un
dertaken to fight. Aside from the es
j cape of gas, due to the men's reckless
I hacking of pipes while seeking to find
j the seat of the blaze, there was the fact
I that two hours were consumed in
. steady work by the firemen before the
I blaze was finally put out. The house
was filled with smoke when the depart
ment engines arrived at 5 o'clock. The
family, including Mr. Smith, his wife
and several children, had already been
forced by it to leave their rooms, bare
ly escaping with their lives and fleeing
in their night clothes to a neighbor's
house, where a fire alarm was sent in.
1 They could give no hints to the fire
men regarding the cause of the fire,
nor where it started. The men were
forced to hack away at floors and par
titions, peeking the blaze, which was
what the men called "a blind fire." The
damage by fire amounted to about $500.
That fropi water and axes is expected
to foot u"p as much more. The house
and contents were fully insured.

Treatment of Habitual Criminals.
The test of the habitual criminal is
the lack of response to reformative in
fluences- The beginner in crime, what
ever his temperament or his apparent
hardness of heart, is entitled to at least
one opportunity to show whether he is
thus amenable to reformatory influ
ences or not. If not and he persists in
criminal action, the interest of society
would seem to demand the indetermi
nate sentence and he muse be made to
understand that, having forfeited his
chance to shape his own career, he be
longs to the State, and that whether
his imprisonment lasts for a shorter or
longer period depends upon himself.â

low to allow for conditions that Â«aay

OIL EXPLOSION
CREATES HAVOC
Wrecks Furnace-Room in
City Hall of Alameda and
Janitor Has a Close Call
ALAMEDA, Jan. 14.âWrenched from
Its hinges and hurled with terrific veloc
ity by an explosion of oil. a heavy iron
furnace door just grazed the head of
Janitor Edward L. Ward in the fire
room of the City Hall this morning.
The weighty missile tore through the
side of the building, carrying two win
dows with it. Ward was upon his hands
and knees endeavoring to regulate a
valve in an oil tank when the flying
door passed over his pate, otherwise he
would in all probability have been
killed. Bricks from the walls of the big
furnace were scattered all about the
flreroom, and it was with difficulty that
Ward extricated himself from the de
bris after the explosion.
Ward attributes the explosion to a
leak in an oil pipe in the furnace lead
ing up to one of the jets. After igniting
the burners in the furnace this morn
ing he went to another part of the
building to do some work. When he re
turned to the flreroom he observed from
a gauge that there was but little oil in
one of the supply tanks. He turned off
the furnace Jets and was filling the
tank when the explosion took place.
Oil from a defective pipe in the furnace
had trickled over the heated flues, gen
erating a great volume of gas. This, it
is supposed, was Ignited by a stray
spark in the furnace and the explosion
followed. The detonation Jarred the big
municipal building and caused wide
spread consternation among the city
officials. _ _

Rather than face an investigation by
the police that might reveal his Iden
tity, Eugene Legros, the young Bel
gian arrested for thefts of bric-a-brac
from Brigadier General Oscar F. Long,
pleaded guilty to-day in the Police
Court. But the move may not help
Legros, for Rene Halewyck, Consul for
Belgium at San Francisco, has taken
up the case and has written to Brus

mand.
The young man, it is said, is the
son of a member of a prominent ship

is thought he left home because of
youthful escapades among the gay set
in the Belgian capital. The young man
persistently declines to disclose his real
name or anything that might uncover
his true self to the police.

PERSONAL RAID
Bt THE MAYOR
His Honor Causes the Arrest
of a Shopkeeper Who Uses
Some Over-Strong Epithets
WANTS NO OBSTRUCTION
Executive Attempt to Clear
Sidewalks Subjects Head
of City to Insolent Abuse
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 14.
Mayor Wan-en Olney took a hand to
day in the work of clearing obstruc
tions from the public highways. He or
dered the arrest of Edwin F. Lee, a
fruiterer at 23 Telegraph avenue, after
Lee, it rs charged, had refused to move
a lot of merchandise from the sidewalk
and had savagely abused his Honor for
interference. Lee was sent to the City
Prison, where he refused to accept the
privilege of bail. The irate merchant, of
his own motion, waa locked" up in tank
one.
The Mayor was passing Lee's stand
this morning when he noticed the side
walk crowded with an assortment of
wares belonging to the merchant's es
tablishment.
"1 called your attention a week ago
to this unlawful use of the sidewalk."
remarked Mayor Olney to the fruit
dealer.
"You'd better keep on to San Fran
cisco," replied Lee, in ugly tones. "All
you do is to bother merchants. You've
made enough trouble already."
His Honor repeated his request that
the sidewalk be cleared for the use of
pedestrians. This is said to have
brought a volley of profanity from Lee
and a further hint that unless the
Mayor moved on the fruit man might
"punch the Mayor's head."
The Mayor sent to the City Hall and
directed Policeman Tobin to arrest Lee
on a charge of obstructing the side
walks. Lee sent for friends, who gave
a bond for Lee's appearance Monday
morning in the Police Court.
In connection with the crusade for
unobstructed thoroughfares Street In
spector W. W. Blair has reported to the
Mayor, under orders, the location of all
wooden sidewalk awnings erected with
in the fire limits. These will be ordered
down at once. Legislation touching the
removal of telegraph, telephone and
electric light masts in the business dis
trict is under consideration by the city
authorities.
ENCROACHMENTS OF SEA
CUTTING BRITAIN'S AREA
Alarming Shrinkage Taking Place on
Many Parts of Her Seagirt
Coasts.
The alarming extent to which the
sea is diminishing the area of the
British Isles is hardly realized.
It is no longer safe to build near the
coast line in many places, so persist
ent is the encroachment of the waters.
Freshwater bay, in the Isle of Wight,
is a case in point. Here there is great
danger that Freshwater and Totland
will be entirely cut off from the rest
of the Isle of Wight, and a circum
stance making the matter exception
ally serious is that on the portion
which would be isolated are all the
fortifications of the western part of
the isle, including the Needles fort,
with its powerful ordnance.
The extent of the ravages of the sea,
says the London Express, may be
judged by the fact that tne continuous
cliff road which formerly went round
this portion of the isle has been cut
and now leads straight over the cliff
into the sea.
In the current issue of the Lifeboat
Society's journal an astounding state
ment is made. It is said that parts of
the Holderness coast, in Yorkshire, be
tween Bridlington and Spurn, are be
ing swallowed up by the sea in ex
ceptional years by as much as twenty
ftet a year.
At Pakefleld, Suffolk, in 18S4, the in
stitution had two lifeboat houses on
the seafront with timber slipways for
launching the boats. Not only has
every vestige of the houses and slip
ways disappeared, but many of the
buildings standing some distance far
ther inland have been washed away.
There are other parts of the coast,
according to this journal, where to
erect anything of a character intended
to be permanent would be simply
throwing money into the sea.
The of dealing with the
encroachment is that the aea is inex
orable, and if its advance is stopped in
one place it will force its way in an
other.
Big Profits for Kansas Roads.
A report of the State Railroad Com

about J56.000.000. The revenue from
the freight business was $39,765,310 81
and from the passenger traffic $12,
--262,653 77. The total number of tons
of freight hauled by all the roads was
19,063,178. The expense of operating
the railroads for the year was about
$38,000,000, leaving a net profit to the
stockholders of $18,000,000 27. The

loss. The deficiency amounted to

TRAIL FRIEND
AND TAKE MAN
Police Arrest Fugitive Who
Is Charged With Part in
Gem Theft at Los Angeles
EFFORT TO WARN FAILS
Emile Formus Caught While
Attempt Is Being Made to
Tell Him He Is Pursued
Oakland Office, San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 14.
Emile Formus. charged with com
plicity In a theft of diamonds at Los
Angeles, was arrested this morning
near the residence of Andrew Schmidt,
5700 Fremont street, by Detective
George Kyte, Sergeant of Police Frank
Lynch and Patrolman T. Brown. For
mus was captured because of his friend
Schmidt's efforts to warn him that the
police were on his trail.
Word was received last night from
Los Angeles asking the Oakland po
lice to arrest Formus at the Schmidt
place. The police went to the house,
but in their effort to enter were met
by Schmidt, who became so obstreper
ous that he was sent to police head
quarters, after his house had been
searched and no Formus found. There
he agreed to return home and to no
tify the police as soon as Formus
should appear. The police suspected
Schmidt would not keep his word and
they trailed him after he left the sta
tion.
Instead of going home Schmidt went
to Golden Gate station on the Berke
ley broad gauge line and there waited
until Formus arrived on the last train
from San Francisco.
The police took Formus into custody
before Schmidt had a chance to warn
him to get away. â
HUMAN FLESH USED
FOR SHARK BAIT
Method Employed by Hawaiian Chiefs
in the Catching of Man-
Eaters.
It appears that the Hawaiian chiefs
of some years ago were much addicted
to the use of human flesh as bait for
sharks. It came cheaper than pig, was
equally acceptable to the shark and
gave the chief an opportunity to kill
any one whom he disliked. The vic
tim was cut up and left to decompose
for two or three days in a receptacle.
Kamehameha I was a great shark
hunter and kept those of his victims
who were/intended for bait penned up
near the great temple of Mookini.
Mrs. Beckley gives a particularly in
terest account of another method of
capturing the huge niuhi, or man-eat
ing shark, followed by the natives,
They first of all captured a large num
ber of the small common shark, saved
their livers with a portion of the flesh,
wrapped them in ki leaves and baked
them underground. From fifty to a
hundred canoes were loaded with the
baked meat and large quantities of the
pounded roots of awa, mixed with a
little water and contained in large
gourds. The fleet would sail many
miles out to sea in the direction in
which the niuhi is known to appear.
Arrived at a comparatively shallow
place, the canoe containing the head
fisherman and the priest and the sor
cerer, who was supposed to be indis
pensable, would cast anchor; meat and
the baked liver would be thrown over
board, a few bundles at a time, to at
tract sharks. After a few days the
grease and scent of cooked meats
would spread through the water many
miles in a radius. The irfuhi would al
most always make /its appearance
after the third or fourth day, when
bundles of the baked meat were
thrown to it as fast as it could swallow
them. After a while it would become
comparatively tame and would come
up to one or other of the canoes to be
fed. Bundles of the liver with the
pounded awa would then be it,
and It would become not only satiated,
but also stupefied with awa.
A noose was then slipped over its
head and the fleet raised anchor and
set sail for home, the shark following,
a willing prisoner, and the occupants
of the nearest canoes being carefdl to
feed it upon the same mixture from
time to time. It was led right into
shallow water until it was stranded,
and then killed. Every part of the
bones and skin was supposed to con
fer unflinching bravery upon the pos
sessor, and the actual captorâthat Is,
the one who slipped the noose over the
nluhi's headâwould also, ever after,
be always victorious.âForest and
Stream.
Russia and Popular Government.
Itf is doubtful if the Russian people
are ready for even a cpnstitutional
monarchy. Certainly they are not
ready for a representative govern
ment. There is a gradual process of
liberalization and education which
they must pass through before they
can be fit for carrying on the most
difficult government on carth â that of
a republic. The success of a republic
is not due to the inherent virtues of
the democratic system, but to the
virtues and competency of the mass
of citizenship. The same failure which
would be sure to attend the establish
ment of a republic in the Philippine
Islands âthe same failure which is
seen in the countries of South America
might be expected if Russia through
a revolution should destroy her mon
archial system and attempt at once a
democratic government. Russia has
the long, hard road to travel which
leads to general education and general
intelligence before she can hope to
sustain a government by the
Kansas City Journal.
Abbey's Coronation Picture.
Edwin E. A. Abbey has almost fin
ished his picture of the gorgeous coro
nation scene in Westminster Abbey.
The final strokes were deferred in a
curious way. King Edward had seen
the great canvas and was much
pleased. About that time a courtier
whispered in the royal ear that the
coronation robe hid the royal legs from
view. His Majesty, who is very human,
bit at the bait, and Mr. Abbey was
asked to readjust the robe in such a
way as to reveal one of his Majesty's
legs. The leg was painted from a model
with handsome limbs. When the King
saw the picture again he was delight
ed. The firm, graceful line of the calf,
curving so elegantly in white silk hose,
stirred the royal imagination. He insist
ed that both legs should be shown.
This, of course, necessitated a more
serious change in the arrangement of
the robe, the key of the whole scheme
of color, and therefore a modification
of the general tone of the picture.
MUSIC-LOVERS
MAKE A PLEA
FOR BUILDING
BY ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE.
OAKLAND, Jan. 14.âRumor has lt
that a club building: is soon to be erect
ed in San Francisco that will not only
furnish accommodation for several so
cial organizations, but will include a
good-sized auditorium. Undoubtedly
such a building is needed in San Fran
ciscoâthe only concert hall there is lit
tle better than a barn. But we Oak
landers are in still greater need. We
have absolutely no place where good
music, or even a lecture, can be listened
to with any kind of mental or physical
comfort. The Oakland Club haa ar
ranged for the services of Jacob Riis
for a lecture next week and was obliged
to make a virtue of necessity and take
Reed Hall for the occasion. Unless that
place is crowded the club and the two
kindergartens under whose auspices the
lecture will be given will have very lit
tle profit to share. All the artists that
come to San Francisco would be heard
here if there were a decent hall In
which they could sing or play.

local talent for the Fruitvale Chapel,
and later "The Little Tycoon" will be
presented for Fablola. The management
of both these operas have been com
pelled at great expense to engage a
local playhouse.
Then there are the three big musical
clubsâthe Hughes, the Orpheus and
the Wednesday Morning clubsâthat
frequently give entertainments that
are- worthy better environment than
now obtainable. Every time any one of
the numerous charitable organizations
gives a benefit there is first a grand
skirmish for a hall. But in spite of po
litical millstones and propinquity to the
metropolis, Oakland is gradually be
coming something more than a vaude
ville joke, and mayhap some day some
of our own rich men, who like F. C
Havens and F. M. Smith are lovers of
art also, will build an auditorium that
will make us rise and call them blessed.
Let us hope the present generation will
not be precluded by old age from its
benefits.

"Pinafore," that is being now re
hearsed, will be given at Ye Liberty
Theater on February 7 and promises
to be a great musical success. Mrs.
Henry Wetherbee i* engineering the
affair and keeping enthusiasm up to
the necessary pitch. Miss Pearl King
is stage manager and is working seven
days out of the week to insure the
little opera's success, and those who
know Miss King's ability are satisfied
that. "Pinafore"will be an artistic pro
duction. Anson Hilton is musical di
rector. The choruses are ample and
the leading parts are all in good
hands. Mrs. Mary Carpeneto Mead,
who will play Josephine, is not only a
clever actress and sweet singer, but a
beautiful woman as well. With luxu
riant hair of a perfect Titian tint,
great brown eyes and a lily-like skin,
Mrs. Mead is an unusual and fascin-
ating type.
Miss Gertrude Gould, one of Oak
land's most charming society girls,
will essay the role of Buttercup, and
Miss Ruth Weston will be Hebe. San
ford Bennett of Alameda promises an
admirable Sir Joseph Porter, and
Harry Perry of the Press Club quar
tet will be the captain. Dr. F*rank
Rudolph as Ralph Rackstraw, Louis
Jacoby as Dick Deadeye and Clarence
Oliver as the bos'n are all good sing
ers, so altogether the cast seems to be
more than ordinarily attractive.

Now comes forth the Hughes Club
with the programme for its first con
cert of the season and the first an
nouncement that holds the eye Is that
Ricardo Augusto Encarnacao (lt Is
not necessary to say It all at once!),
the noted Italian barytone now in our
midst, will sing. It seems he is a
friend of Llewellyn Hughes, son of
D. P. Hughes, and It was through
him that the famous singer was per
suaded to appear at the coming con
cert.
The Hughes Club is the largest and
most successful woman's choral on
the coast and its biennial concerts are
always important musical events. The
coming concert will take place next
Friday evening. The club officers this
year are: Mrs. Wilber Walker, pres
ident; Mrs. J. E. Henderson, secre
tary; Miss Lalia Phillip?, treasurer;
Mrs. Charles Poulter. Mrs. Lewelyn
Williams, voice committee; Mrs. Karl
Nickel, Mrs. Elanoir Campbell, music
committee: Mrs. Robert Hughes, ac
companist; D. P. Hughes, director.
The Goldfields Labor Council ot
West Australia has passed a resolu
tion in favor of a six-hour working
day, and as a Labor Ministry is in
power the idea is likely to be realized.
ArJVERTTSEMENTS.
The hair of
your head
The hair of the head is
far more sensitive to
climatic changes than is
usually supposed, and this
fact is peculiarly apparent
in California.
When the hair becomes
dry, brittle and falls out
and dandruff forms upon
the scalp it is an absolutely
certain indication of
diseased conditions, which,
unless promptly treated,
will result in baldness.
Coke Dandruff Cure is
the only remedy thus far
discovered which will not
only remove dandruff, but
will positively grow
new hair. /
That it will do so has
been proved by thousands.
It is a perfectly pure
liquid, free from even a
trace of sediment, sulphur
or any injurious ingredients
whatsoever.
It is delightfully refresh
ing, and under its benign
influence the hair quickly
regains the softness and
gloss of youth, and a new.
vigorous growth takes the
place of that which has been
lost.

THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Few People Know How Useful It Is
â¢ jn Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char
( ;; ; is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
â¢ i v. realize its value when taken into '
the'human system for the same cleans
" ing puroose. *
t'harcoal is a remedy that the more j
v ,v' take of it the better; it is not a |
Ug at all. but simply absorbs the t
' s and impurities always present in
I j stomach and intestines and carries
.them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
iioking, drinking or after eating
onions *nd other odorous vegetables.
â¢Charcoal effectually clears and im
proves the complexion, it whitens the
ami further acts as a natural and
eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which j
' collect in the stomach and bowels; it I
disinfects the mouth and throat from |
the poison of catarrh.
All druggist* sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best ;
charcoal and the most for the money
Is. in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
Willow charcoal, and other harmless
â  antiseptics in tablet form or rather in
. the form of large, pleasant tasting loz
enges, the charcoal being mixed with
>honey. â¢
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condition
of the general health, better eomplcx
' ion, sweeter breath and purer blood,
. and the beauty erf <t is. that no possible
h.irrp can result from their continued
â¢"use. but on the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients suffering front gas in stom
. rich and bowels, and to clear the com
plexion and purify the breath, mmith
. and throat; 1 also believe the liver is
greaqy benefited by the daily use of
j them; they cost but 25 cents a box at
drug stores, and although in some sense
â¢a patent preparation, yet I believe I
get more and better charcoal in Stuart's
Charcoal Lozenges than in any of the.
ordinary charcoal tablets."

WAGON GUARD WITH THEFT
Driver George W. Perkins Accuse*
Eddie Driscoll of Committing
WeUs-Fargo Robbery.
George W. Perkins, a driver ln the
employ of the Wells-Fargo Express
Company, yesterday swore out a war
rant before Police Judge Fritz for the
â  arrest of Eddie Driscoll, charging
.him with grand larceny. Driscoll,
Who lived on Guerrero street between
Thirteenth and Fourteenth, was em
ployed by the express company as a
â¢ guard and accompanied Perkins on
his rounds.
Driscoll had been at work one
- week when the package containing
$180 in gold disappeared on January
5 from the wagon on which Perkins
was the driver. , The next day, accord
ing to the officers of the company,
Drisooll reported "sick" and has not
been seen since by them.
The call for a warrant for Drlscoll's
arrest is said by the express com
pany officials to be the personal af
fair of Perkins and that the company
had nothing to do with the matter*
This is given as an explanation of the
fact that over a week was allowed to
elapse between the disappearance of
Driscoll and the Issuance of the war-
rant.
Perkins refused to make any state
ment as to his swearing out the war
rant, but it is believed that lt was at
the instigation of Chief of Police Witt
man, who is his personal friend. De
tective Tom Ryan, who was detailed
on the case, arrested Driscoll at a late
hour last night. He refused to make
any statement beyond saying that he
expected arrest and that he would
make some one suffer for having
caused it.

RICH MENDICANT FALLS
DEAD ON THE STREET
Aged Man, Supposed to be William
Glennon, Carries Gold Coin and
a Bank Book.
A man nearly 90 years old, sup
posed to be William Glennon, dropped
dead yesterday afternoon on Market
street, between Eighth and Ninth.
Though he was garbed as a beggar,
gold coin was found in his pockets,
with a bank book showing that he
had nearly $4000 on deposit In one of
the local banks.
Little Is known of Glennon. While
walking along Market street he was
seen to totter and fall. He had every
appearance of a mendicant. But when
the Morgue officials conveyed the
body to the Morgue and searched the
grimy clothing a different state of af
fairs came to light. In a pocket stuf
fed with old tobacco sacks, trash and
trinkets waa found a $20 gold piece.
In another pocket, wrapped ln an old
rag, was $1 90 in small change. When
the vest was examined a bank book
was found sewed ln Its lining. The
book had been issued by the Hibernia
Bank and showed an account of
$3931 30 in favor of William Glennon
or Bridget Glennon. The last deposit
of $30 waa made on October 10. The
Coroner's deputies thus far have been
unable to discover who the man is or
his place of residence. It Is believed
from his appearance, however, that
he earned his money as a beggar and
lived as a miser. Bridget Glennon is
thought to be his wife. Though the
bank account was started mary years
ago, not one cent has been drawn out
since the first entry.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 15, 1905.
SAYS SHE TRIED TO SAVE
ARMSTRONG FROM JAIL
Miss May Shelp Denies Extortion
Charge Made by Young Man's
Father.
Erwin A. Armstrong, who shot him- i
self in the Pantheon apartment-house
at 462 Eddy street last Thursday, died
last night at the Central Emergency
Hospital. His father, who has been
with him since his injury, charges
that he was met at the train which
brought him from his home in San
Pedro by Miss May Shelp and her
friends and that a demand for $650
was immediately made on him. He
says that whÂ«n he refused they fol
lowed htm to his son's cot ln the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital and again
pressed him for the money, which j
they averred was due them through I
loans made to the dying boy.
Miss Shelp says she only tried to !
collect $50 from her erstwhile lover's 1
father, which she loaned the young j
man the day before he shot himself. !
Miss Shelp's friends claim that she is
a much abused woman. They say
tl } 7,Z? ns , Arr Â«strong was ln finan
cial difficulties; that he brought with
him from Los Angeles a woman who
took all of his money, and that he
shot himself because he had to make
good a certain amount of money at 4
o'clock on last Thursday or go to jail
This money, they say, was obtained by
false pretenses from a business house l
â¢< Luu ,To meftt thla emergency
M ss Shelp loaned him $50, half of
all the money she had. Findine this
â¢Â° s ; insufficient, Armstrong* shot j
Firemen Must Not Gamble.
The Fire Commissioners at a meet
ing yesterday made lt plain to the
members of the department that they
must not gamble on horse races. Bat
talion Chief E. F. McKittrick pre
ferred charges against John O'Donnell
of Truck 9, who he caught going into
a saloon while on duty. O'Donnell's
explanation was that he was merely
disposing of a card on the races for
a policeman. The excuse was too
flimsy for the Commissioners and he
forfeited fifteen days' pay. Chief En
gineer Sullivan was instructed to
make a rigorous investigation of the
entire department on this subject.
Nicholas Roebling of Engine Com
pany No. 12 also forfeited thirty days'
pay for leaving the engine-house
while on duty.
Woman Arrested for Theft.
A young woman giving the name of
Eddy Wilson was arrested last, night
by Policeman Cook and charged at
th* Southern station with grand lar
ceny. She is accused of having sto
len a feather boa from a restaurant
at 1007 Market street. She afterward
gave it to the manager of the Puritan
restaurant as security for a meal that
she was unable to pay for.

I ANTI-MORMON
! CLAIMS DENIED

by the Testimony Given
by Leading Western Men
NOT FOE OF NATION
Endowment House Oath Con-
Jains Nothing Conflicting
With Citizenship Duties
WASHINGTON, Jan. 14.âEleven wit
nesses testified to-day before the Sen
ate Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions In the investigation of protests
against the seating of Senator Reed
Smoot. All except two told of political
; conditions in Utah and of the Mormon
Endowment House ceremony. Several
j witnesses said the ceremony included
I no obligations that were ln conflict with
the duties of a citizen to his State or
nation. Chairman Burrows asked two
of the witnesses to give the nature of
the ceremonies, but both refused, on
the ground that they had given oaths
; not to divulge what had taken place
i within the Temple.
James E. Lynch of Salt Lake City,
j was the first witness to-day. He is a
; Democrat and a non-Mormon. Chair
man Burrows asked Lynch concerning
the feeling of young Mormons on the
j question of polygamy. Witness Baid
j they felt that the practice must be
j "done away with." but that he had
; heard nothing of the "young Mor
mons making a protest to the heads
of the church."
REFUSES TO REVEAL OATH.
H. M. Dougall of Springville, Utah,
! who explained that he was "fired" from
the Mormon church, was called to the
I stand. He is postmaster of his town
lof 3500 inhabitants. He could think of
i only five polygamists in Springville,
. and said there had been no polygamous
j marriages since IS'JO. His expulsion
from the church in 1574, he said, had
not made a particule of difference in
I his business, even though a majority
i of his business came from Mormons.
| Chairman Burrows asked the witness
jto state the nature of the ceremony
i performed when he was married in
j the Endowment House, and Mr. Dou
gall replied:
"I do not believe I care to tell that,
; Senator." * ;
"Was there a penalty attached if you
revealed what took place?"
"Yes, sir."
'What was that penalty?"
"I decline to state."
i "Was it severe?"
"As I remember, it was."
"Was it death?"
| "I do not believe I care to answer
i any more questions on that subject."
: He said the oath was to avenge the
â  blood of the prophets, or martyrs, on
"this generation." and act on "this na
; tion," as had been testified,
j NO HOSTILITY TO NATION.
A. A. Noon of Provo, a Republican
Justice of the Peace and a former Mor
mon, who voluntarily withdrew from
the church in 1870, testified that young
Mormons were opposed to polygamy,
and also that Mormons were not taking
any interest in politics as a church. He
has been a candidate for office bien
nially since 1S&0, and with the excep
tion of 1896 has defeated Mormon can
didates. He indorsed Senator Smoot
highly and was not surprised, he said,
at his election as Senator.
After his marriage, Noon said, he
took the endowments. Worthington
asked him if he took an oath to avenge
the blood of the prophets "on this na
tion." The witness said nothing in the
obligation expressed hostility to the na
tion or to this Government. He said
;it was taken from the Scriptures, Rev
elation, chapter 6, verses 9 and 10.
There was nothing in it, he said, of dis
; loyalty to the United States.
j Chairman Burrows asked Noon in re
gard to the endowment ceremony, and
he declined to state its nature. He
would not say whether there was a
change in wearing apparel, whether
there was a severe penalty attached to
revealing what had taken place or any
thing connected with the obligations.
"What would you say as to whether
the penalty was to have the tongue
torn out or the vitals cut out of the
body?" asked Chairman Burrows.
"I do not feel that I could answer,"
Noon replied.

was 20 years of age and then drifted
away from the church. He testified that
polygamy was decreasing and that he
had known of no plural marriages since
1890.
SENTENCED MANY MORMONS.
Judge Miner of Salt Lake City, who
went to Utah in 1890 from Michigan to
take the position of Associate Justice
of the Supreme Court of the Territory
and was a Justice of that court until
1903, testified in regard to the prosecu
tions before him of Mormons charged
with unlawful cohabitation. He said
he had sent more than 100 to the peni
tentiary. _ . . _
Judge Miner expressed the opinion
that President Joseph Smith was doing
everything he could to keep the Mor
mon church out of politics. Smith was
an honest man, he said.
W. D. Candland of Mount Pleasant,
Utah, a Mormon but not a polygamist,
testified that the Mormon people as
serted their independence in voting and
would brook no interference with lt.
He said that by agreement the School
Board ln Mount Pleasant was non-par
tisan from a religious and political
point of view. _
"If President Smith should seek to
re-establish the practice of polygamy
he would And himself in a hopeless
minority and there would be a big
row," said Candland.

We, the jury, find Charles Wyman, the defendant at the bar, guilty of the crime of felony, to wit, fraudulently voting at a primary
election as charged in the information.âVerdict returned by the jury in the ballot-stuffing case.
MAESTRETTI DENOUNCED
BY DISTRICT ATTORNEY
bays 1 hat Leader Should Be in State Prison
* il . !
â¢ CHABI.Efi WYMAN, WHO WAS CONVICTED OF A FELONT BY A JURY IN JUDGE LAWLOR'S COURT YESTERD\Y AND
DISTRICT ATTORNEY LEWIS F. B YINGTON IN THE ACT OF DENOUNCING THE DEFENDANT FOR FRAUDULENT
VOTING AT THE LAST PRIMARY ELECTION.
Charles Wyman was found guilty
yesterday of voting fraudulently at
the .primary election held on August 0.
It took the Jury just an hour and forty
five minutes to settle on a verdict.
Wyman heard the reading of his fate
. -with little show of emotion. His wife,
who was sitting near him, burst Into
'tears as Foreman George H. Bucking
ham read the words that may send her
husband to the penitentiary. Wyman
looked straight ahead, apparently ob
livious to everything around him.
Judge Lawlor ordered Wyman's ball
â returned, and the ballot-box stuffer
was taken to the County Jail. Sentence
will be passed on him next Saturday
.forenoon at 10 o'clock.
In the closing argument for the pros
ecution District Attorney Byington de
livered a scathing denunciation of
Frank Maestretti, member of the
Board of Works, the reputed leader in
. the Thirty-ninth District, where Wy
man got himpelf into trouble. The Dis
trict Attorney did not mince when he
said:
' "We will never have a community of
which we will be proud when attaches
of the municipal government serve as
election officers. We will never have
work done as it should be done when
men are appointed by the caprices of
those who- order ballot stuffing."
Referring to the circular issued by
Maestretti denouncing Fitzgerald, By
ington raid:
"This circular is issued by men who
stalk about at night. They creep
through dark alleys and streets and
leave such thingv on doorsteps. This
kind of work has been done before, and
always by men who go abroad after
dirk and stab in the back.
FOSTER SCORED.
"Why was that man Fo>Â«.er put in
on election booth except to wink at
fraud, as he did? All those election
officers were put there as chattels.
Regard ing Policeman Burns, can
you pay any attention to his testi
mony? .There Is no better police force
ours iii the world, but there are
a few men on it who think that they
can advance through resort to cor
ruption. There are some men who
think that they ought to 'stand well'
villi a poetical boss, although civil
service prevails, as it ought to pre
vail.
"If there ever was a case in which
an honest Jury should bring in a ver
" diet for conviction It is this case. I
am only sorry that every man who
had to do with the fraudulent voting
in the Seventy-third Precinct Is not
in a felon's cell. If the man who pulled
the string "was where he ought to be
lie would be in the State prison. lam
sure that he will be some timeâl hope
that he will be.
"This case is not being prosecuted
by any association or any particular
attorney. The people are the prose
THE M CALL
cutorsâthe people whose rights have
been violated. It Is the duty of this
jury to stamp the felon's mark on
the brow of this man, who is guilty of
corrupting the purity of election."
For an hour and a half the District
Attorney was on his feet, tearing to
shreds the unstable structure of evi
dence built up by the defense. He took
th? attitude of the defendant as a
subject, and his denunciations were
also directed against Maestretti and
his appointees as election officers.
In the afternoon Judge Lawlor gave
his instructions to the jury. All the
law governing elections and violation
of election laws were read, and at
3:15 the jury retired.
WYMAN NOT NERVOUS.
For nearly half an hour Wyman kept
his seat, working his jaws mechan
ically. Mrs. Wyman, pale as death,
bowed her head. Both appeared to be
listening for the sound that would an
nounce the return of the Jury. But as
time wore on Wyman seemed to be re
assured. In the meantime it was whis
pered around that the jury had dis
agreed. Just as 5 o'clock struck the
Jury came out and filed into the box.
"Gentlemen of the Jury, are you
agreed upon a verdict?" asked the
clerk.
"We are," replied Foreman George H.
Buckingham. "We find the defend
ant at the bar, Charles Wyman, guilty
of the crime of felony, to-wit: fraudu
lently voting at a primary election, as
< harged in the Information."
Attorney Countryman asked that the
juty be polled.
The crime for which Wyman may be
sent to State prison was committed on
August 9 of last year. During the
primary election held on that date
Wyman entered the booth in Precinct
73 of the Thirty-ninth District and
voted the name of S. H. Mann. He
was seen by Fairfax Wheelan. vice
president of the Merchants' Associa
tion, and that organization hired de
tectives to complete the chain of evi
dence and engaged two special attor
neys. John Hosmer and George P.
Wright. These lawyers co-operated
with the District Attorney.
Wyman refused to discuss his fate,
and after bidding good-by to his wire
and reassuring her, he walked to the
County Jail, escorted by the bailiff
and a deputy Sheriff.
Police Arrest Undertaker.
Herman Metzler, an undertaker on
Washington street near Kearny, and
his assistant, J. C. Sells, were arrested
last night by Sergeants John Greene
and James Donovan and charged with
battery. The victim was Hugo Meyer,
who was ln the habit, according to the
accused, of constantly ringing the un
dertaker's doorbell and blowing up
the speaking tube, causing them an
noyance.

Seeks .$50,000 Damages From
Those Who Took Him Cap

Chan Cheung, whom the Grand Jury
Indicted for the murder of Tom Yick,'
will invoke the Federal courts in an
effort to obtain redress for his detention
by Foreman Andrews and E. J. Bowes
of the police committee, who tried to
force from him a statement of his con
nection with police corruption in China
town. He yesterday filed suit in the
Circuit Court against Thomas P. An
drews, Edward J. Bowes, Andrew M.
Davis and William G. Stafford of the
police committee of the Grand Jury;
Hammersley McMurray, the Grand
Jury's bailiff, and L. G. Carpenter, an
attorney, who assisted in the capture
of the plaintiff. He demands $50,000
damages.
Chans complaint sets forth that
he is a subject of the Emperor of
China, which fact gives the Federal
courts jurisdiction in his suit. He com
plains:
"That on December 20 the defendants
unlawfully assaulted the plaintiff and
wrongfully and with violence, menace,
fraud and deceit compelled him to go
from his dwelling-house at 604 Jackson
street to the Mills building, and thence
to other building or buildings, and
there unlawfully restrained him of his
personal liberty and kept him a pris
oner without any probable cause or
lawful authority and against his will
for about forty hours.
"That by reason of said acts of de
fendants plaintiff has been greatly in
jured in his credit, reputation, circum
stances, financial standing and bodily
health, has suffered great mental an
guish, has been prevented from trans
acting his ordinary business and has
been otherwise injured, all in the sum
of $50,000."
Chan's attorneys are Bell & Strauss,
James H. Budd, Henry C, Dibble and
Oliver Dibble.
District Attorney Byington laughed
when asked about the suit and said it
would "never amount to anything."

DISCOVERY OF FRAUD
A DIFFICULT MATTER
Great Volume of Applications
â¦
Registrar Adams Says All Cannot
Be Specially Checked Up.
; Mayor Schmitz began his investiga
; tion yesterday morning of the charges
i against the Election Commissioners
j that they failed to observe the law in
' appointing precinct officers for the
! primaries held last August. The hear
j ing was not concluded, the Mayor ex
! pressing a wish to go deeper into the
â  matter, but the testimony of the mem
! bers of the board and of Registrar
Adams was taken. All denied knowl
' edge of the disqualifications of several
I election officers who served in the
i Seventy-third and Eightieth precincts,
| where frauds were committed. Next
! Saturday at 11 o'clock was fixed as the
' time for resuming the hearing.
While not admitting the disqualifica
tions of the precinct officers in ques
tion, the commissioners and Registrar
pleaded that owing to the volume of
work involved it was an utter impossi
bility to guard against imposition by
those who make application for the
one-day job of receiving and counting
ballots. The course pursued in select
ing and appointing the boards was that
"Which has obtained for many years,
and, if there has been any change, the
commissioners said, it has been an
added vigilance to protect the ballot
box.
The charges filed with the Mayor
were that the commissioners "will
fully, knowingly, unlawfully and cor
ruptly appointed Joseph Hebstock,
Fred Hancock, E. E. Whitney, J. W.
Freeman, John Spargo and W. H.
Abraham oflkers#for the Eightieth, or
"Almshouse' ureÂ« inefe aware of the
fact that they were not on the assess
ment roll, were all adherents of the
same party, that all except Abraham
were not residents of the precinct, and
that Rebstock was at that time draw
ing a salary from the municipality as
foreman of the cleaning and sprinkling
department under the Board of Public
Works, Hancock as a teamster in the
Department of Electricity under the
same board, and Sparge as a stone
cutter, also under the Public Works'
Beard.
A second count recites that W. J.
Foster, C. M. Silverstein, G. E. Mer
rill, W. Podd, A. R. Goetjen and Iv. S.
Carson were appointed to serve in the
Seventy-third precinct, despite the fact
that they were not on the assessment
roll and that they all belonged to the
same party.
BASED OX JI'RY'S EVIDENCE.
The charges were based on the evi
dence gathered by the Grand Jury re
sulting in the indictment of Rebstock
and the filing of accusations against
the Election Commissioners. In con
formity with the provisions of the
charter Mayor Schmitz ordered an in
vestigation looking to the removal of
the officials by him if the charges of
misconduct were proved.
Those present at the inquiry were
Commissioners R. W. Roberts, Thomas
McGuire, E. C. L<effingwell, James A.
Devoto and A. W. Voorsnnger, Regis
trar George P. Adams and his deputy,
Harry' Zemansky. The commissioners
were represented by Thomas V. Cator
as counsel.
The first witness called was the
Registrar. He explained how the ap
plicants for positions as election
officers were required to fill out the
blanks in which- the questions were
set forth touching qualifications. For
the 720 positions at the primaries
there were between 5000 and 6000
applications received. "There were
far too many applicants for my office
force to examine critically the qualifi
cations of each man," said Adams.
"The best we could do was to make a
superficial examination. The names of
those appointed were published three
times in a daily newspaper, but we
did not receive a word of complaint
about one of them."
"Were any election officers appoint
ed who had not filled out the appli
cation blanks?"
"Not to my knowledge."
In answer to another question the
Registrar said that he certainly be
lieved at the time that every officer
appointed was duly qualified.
"Did you know that three of the
appointees were employes of the mu
nicipality?"
"I had no such knowledge."
Deputy Zemansky testified that he
had been connected with the Regis
trar's office for over nine years, and
that the method of appointing the pre
cinct boards for last August's pri
maries was identically the same as
that which had been followed during
all his experience in the office.
TASK IMPOSSIBLE.
"Out of a total of 5000 or 6000 ap
plications we receive every year," he
said, "I would judge that not more
than fifty of the men are not on the
great register or assessment roll. It
would practically be an impossibility
for us to guard against misstatements
of the applicants ln the blanks they
sign, covering all points as to quali
fications. The assessment roll consists
of seventeen volumes of personal prop
orty and lifty-four volumes of real es
tate. It would take two men Aye
months to copy the names from them,
and about three months for our office
force to look up each applicant for a
place as election officer. And then the
assessment roll could not be relied on,
for in many instances property is as
sessed to a company, the names of
the members not appearing."
"Were three men appointed who
were employes of the municipality?*'
"Not to our knowledge. lt is no
easy matter to guard against such a
phase if the applicant misrepresents
things to us. We have no list of mu
nicipal employes in our office. There
aro frequent changes in the various
departments, and we would have to
get reports of all employes on the first
Rnd fifteenth of every month. It is im
possible for us to obtain a list of
Federal employes."
The Election Commissioners were
then called in turn and each asserted
that he had no knowledge of appoint
ment of any primary election officer
who was not qualified by law to serve.
Roberts said he was dumfounded when
ho heard that there were precinct
officers who were not on the assess
ment roll, not residents of the pre
cinct and, in some Instance*, employes
of the municipal government.
Zemansky was recalled to testify
that there were no eleventh-hour ap
pointments by the F.lection Commis
sioners in fhe two precincts in ques
tion. The officers served who had been
appointed several weeks previously.
In the Heventy-third precinct J. W.
Freeman was appointed by the pre
rinct board thÂ° morning of the pri
maries to take the place of L. S.
Titus, who failed to appear. This
nction of the board was in accordance
with the provisions of law.
Mil BE HEALtT
BOARD MEMBER
Di\ Sidney Worth. Homeo
path. Appears to Be Reason
ably Sure of Appointment
While no definite announcement was
made yesterday of the appointment of
a successor to Dr. Joseph Poheim on
the Board of Health, it is thought that
Dr. Sidney Worth will be ap
pointed to the place.
The selection of the new member of
the Health Board is said to have been
left to Dr. James W. Ward, and it
is reported that Ward is anxious to
have Dr. Worth as his colleague, it
now remains for Mayor Schmitz to
announce the appointment orhcially,
and this will be done either to-morrow
or next Tuesday.
Dr. Worth is a graduate of the home
opathic school, which is one of the
main reasons why Dr. Ward is favor
ably disposed to recommending his ap
pointment to the Mayor.
Another physician who has been seri
ously considered for the place Is Dr.
Edgar Reeves Bryant. Bryant grad
uated from the Hahnemann Medical
College of Philadelphia in IS9I and was
certificated by the California State
Medical Examiners in 1897. Both Worth
and Bryant are highly regarded by
Dr. Ward.
The proposed shifting of several city
officials, an account of which appeared
in yesterday's Call, caused consider
able comment among politicians and
City Hall attaches. The Mayor con
firmed the announcement that Super
visor Finn had consented to be trans
ferred to the Fire Commission. Just
where Fire Commissioner Boyne will
be put has not been definitely settled,
although the position of Registrar
se#ms to be the most desirable of any
to which he might aspire, except, per
haps, that" of Chief of Police, with
which gosFip has already, connected his
name.
There stents to be some charter pro
vision in the way of Election Commis
sioner Devoto being appointed to the
Board of Supervisors by the Mayor.
The charter makes an Election Com
missioner ineligible to hold any other
office until one year after the expira
tion of his term. This provision, how
ever, did not stand in the way of the
transfer of School Director Boyle from
the Election Commission one year ago.
If Devoto is ineligible to be a Super
visor under the charter provision,
which some attorneys regard as un
constitutional, then the Mayor will
look for another man to defend his
cause In the board. The name of Boyne
has been mentioned in that connection,
but the Mayor says that this rumor
has no foundation in fact. Then In
some quarters it is said that Fire
Commissioner Barrett is the man, but
this could not be confirmed.

EXPLAINS HIS WORK
FOR THE POOR.
Prominent Men Honor Jacoti Riis
Jacob A. Riis, earnest builder of
American citizenship, famous for his
great work in the slums of New York,
and of high place In the modern world
of letters, was the guest of the Com
monwealth Club at a dinner in the ball
room of the Palace Hotel last evening.
There were 200 members of the club,
men and women, to enjoy the few
hours with this singular and distin
guished visitor.
The decorations were pretty, the
presence of women gave unusual charm
to the banquet board, and there was
warm cordiality throughout, for Jacob
Riis has gained strong hold on the af
fections and admiration of San Fran
cisco folk since his recent advent by
way of the lecture platform. Undoubt
edly President Roosevelt's interest in
the man has given him impetus in pop
ular estimation, but the philanthropic
worker has made good himself so- far
as the opinion of Californians is con
cerned.
Such was the forceful testimony at
last nirht's gathering. The 200 diners
had heard his several lectures and he
won their highest esteem. They had
learned of the earnestness of the man
who for years and'years tugged and la
bored with evils that menace good gov
ernment. He had accomplished much
and in large measure showed the way
for reformers.
The Commonwealth Club is Interested
in work for the public weal. It hailed
Jacob Riis as one of its brothers, one
pre-eminent among themselves for his
achievements in their common field of
endeavor for the bettering of the land
and its people. There were many
speeches voicing these sentiments, and
the hearty note of hospitality was
sounded on every hand for one of
"America's most useful citizens."
PRAISES HIS WORK.
President H. Welnstock in his intro
ductory remarks said the Common
wealth Club had departed from for the
evening from its usual sphere as a
working body to pay a "well-merited
tribute to a self-appointed public serv
ant. "Jacob Riis," he said, "has de
servedly won the gratitude of the
American people by showing them how
they can help themselves."
A letter was read from Governor Par
dee expressing his regret that he could
not be present, for there was "no one,"
he wrote, "with whom I would rather
sit down to dinner than Jacob A. Riis."
President Weinstock read the follow
ing telegram from President Roosevelt:
"WASHINGTON, Jan. 13, 1905.
"H. Weinstock, president of the Com
monwealth Club, San Francisco, Cal.:
"I am glad to learn the Common
wealth Club is paying this tribute to
the public service of my friend, Jacob
Riis, and I wish it was possible to be
with you. It is a real pleasure to send
the members of the club and guests, es
pecially the guest of honor, my hearti
est greetings.
"THEODORE ROOSEVELT."
"Roosevelt and Riis are a powerful
team for civic good," added Welnstock
when the applause had subsided. He
then proposed a toast to President
Roosevelt, "a man among kings, a king
among men, and the friends of Jacob
A. Riis."
John McNaught was the first speaker
and the happy sentiment stirred by the
telegram from Washington gave warm
greeting to his toast, "Our President,
Theodore Roosevelt." The native, ele

mental energy, lofty aspirations, high
ideals, together with his unceasing
efforts to urge his fellow m"n
on to greater, nobler endeavor was the
chief characteristics of the great states
man at the head of the nation. There
were honesty, integrity and indomitable
zeal for ripht and for Justice to
all, said the speaker, and well thought
whs the designation of Roosevelt a3
"the typical American."
"The Associated Charities" was th"
subject of a brief discourse by Rev.
Charles R. Brown of Oakland. He had
some interesting statements to makÂ«
concerning the problems that confront
the workers for charity. The Impostor
was a factor that was hard to deal
with, and the speaker told In an inter
esting manner of the difficulties en
countered In trying to help those who
could not help themselves.
David Starr Jordan paid a neat com
pliment to the guest of honor prelimi
nary to discussing the subject of "He
redity and the Waste of Human Life,"
in which address he ran counter to
some of Jacob Rlis' most vigorous
teachings, Jordan said (hat it had been
proved by scientific research that he
redity was responsible ln large measure
for degradation in character. Rils con
tends that "the most of this talk about
heredity is all bosh." "Environments
are alone responsible for shaping of
character, and thank Ood for that."
he said at the Alhambra a few evenincs
ago. "for it gives us a working doctrine
to work ahead with."
HEREDITY NOT RESPONSIBLE.
But Jordan admitted that the unto
ward conditions of New York's slums
tended to the undermining of character
and that heredity was not alone re
sponsible there.
The last speaker was the guest
honor. "Am I My Brother's Keeper?
was his topic, and the applause wÂ«T
enthusiastic for him when he arose.
He began with a pretty sentiment as
to the two flags that shared his af
fections, for while the American was
his flag now, the Danish flag, which
as well was displayed ln a prominent
place in the banquet room, was his
"mother flag."
Of Roosevelt he said: "The longer
you know him the better you like him.
And nothing better can be said of a
man than that. I dreamed and I
planned in vain in my work in New-
York, but not until he came were my
dreams or my aims ever realized.
"I have been a guest in your State
four weeks now and I feel as If I have
a chain on me that will hold me to
California as long as I live. I must
bring my wife with me to this glorious
land. She will have much to learn. I
assure you, for she thinks it a wild and
inhospitable country."
"Am I My Brother's Keeper?" asked
the speaker and his answer waa, "We

VENATOR TAKES THE ADAM ANDREW STAKES
FAVORITE OUTFOOTS LETOLA
FOR THE. STAKE EVENT.
M. D. Miller Secures
the Winner for
$3^oo.
Five Choices First and
the Ring Loses
Heavily.
B~ FRED E. MULHOLLAXD.
lt is not so many weeks ago that
Venator was considered just an or
dinary plater by the usual run of
lurfgoers. At Oakland yesterday, be
fore the customary Saturday gathering
and over a very muddy track. Dr.
Row'eda son of Brutus showed his
heels to a crack cluster of mud larks
in the Adam AndreNv selling stakes, de
cided at six ami a half furlongs. â¢ ln
doing so the gelding e+iriched the wide
ly-known veterinary* bank account to
the extent of $3000, which was the win
ning horse's share of the prize. Leto
la, the Jennings' stable representative,
finished second, and W. R. Condon
third.
There were nine starters, and five of
the owners claimed the apprentice al
lowance. Letola, with Greenfield up,
at first had the call, but Venator,.tho
mount of Davis, closed favorite. The
play waa confined chiefly to these two
starters, though W. R. Condon, Misty's
Pride, Andrew B. Cook and Martinmas
were not without their admirers.
â¢ ' The start was perfect, with Misty's
Pride first to show clear of the bunch.
Venator, with Letola at his heels, soon
joined the Oregon mare, and the lat
ter's lead turned out to be of short
duration. Venator entered the stretch
for home a length ahead of Letola, and
despite Sam Greertfield's diligent ef
forts on the Jennings mare, Venator
held her safe, winning by a length.
W. R. Condon closed strong, running
a close third.
Five heavily played choices reached
the wire in front, and the ring re
ceived an awful scorching. Davis car
ried off the saddle honors.
It begins to look as if D. Cameron,
the owner of Sir Wilfred, has a mort
gage on the two-year-old events. The
introductory number was a three-fur
long scramble for maidens and Grass
cutter, from the Cameron string, made
her nubile debut. She was installed
favorite over Soledad, and, never head
ed, won ridden out from Captain Bur
nett, a 20 to 1 shot. Semilune finished
third.

ln the five and a half furlong dash,
next decided, and the Keene & Co.
cast-off made good. Backed down from
8 to 4*Â£, McÃride got the warm one
away in front, and that is all there
was to it. Bullman landed Pratt in the
place, and Davis drove up from be
hind with the favorite in time to take
the show. J. Jones on Golden Buck
rode a delightful race, and Melar had
speed for half a Kearny street block.
San Nicholas won his first purle for
P. Ryan in the six and a half furlong
purse affair. Played down to 6 to 5 fa
voritism, the black horse, with Davis in
the saddle, made a gallop of it from
start to finish. Rector ran second and
Gateway third. Ishtar does not fancy
muddy going and lost the show by a
neck.
On January 9 Briers, a favorite, with
Travers in the saddle, ran second. But
Briers with Travers in the pilot-house
and Briers ridden by Davis is quite an
other proposition. The mare went to the
post favorite for the mile and a six
teenth selling run, and it proved no
contest. She breezed in ahead of Dun
gannon and Modicum.
A mile handicap, with a field of half a
dozen starting, concluded the sport.
Ishlana. the 13 to 5 favorite, piloted by
McÃride. led Judge from the start, and
in a long drive earned the decision by
a length. Nigrette, miserably ridden by
Chandler, dropped into the show. Stili
cho, Romaine and Oro Viva cut no fig
ure in the.race.
TRACK NOTES.
W. Davis got away with the saddle
honors in hollow fashion. He reached
the wire first on three winners, one be
ing Venator.
Twenty-four bookmakers cut in, find
they experienced a tempestuous ses
sion. Five choices came galloping in,
nnd the ring must have lost more than
$30,000. Joe Rose escaped the mas
sacre by getting aboard The Repro
bate.
M. D. Miller evened up old scores
when Venator won the stake. Last
season Dr. Rowell. owner of the stake
winner, claimed The Don, then the
property of . the Chicago handieapper,
bookmaker and owner. Venator was
entered in the stake to be sold for
$1400. When put up to be bid on Mil
ler said $3000. Dr. Rowell responded
with $5. Mi'ler then gently articulated
$3500. Dr. Rowell began humming

â j ?i! Hnter c drea^ d . fo f its snows Â» cutting winds and damp, unpleasant weather, it is more to be
dreaded because it brings with it the most annoying and disgusting of diseasesâCatarrh. The changed condition
of the weather brings on -bad colds 1 ' which irritate the inner skin and tissues, and they secrete an unhealthy
matter that is absorbed by the blood and scattered all through the system in its circulation, and at the first sign of
winter the patient begins to "hawk and spit." All the mucus membranes and tissues of the body are affected by
this disease, and the filthy, poisonous matter finds its way to every part of the body, making the sufferer dull and
half sick all the time. The head and eyes have blinding aches, the stomach bloats, the hearing is often affected and
S-mWkP& AmWSam Sis 4 worse forms tne soft boneS of the nose and head are destroyed. Local ap
jflpiMj JP"Qh[ such as sprays, washes and inhalations can do no more than give ter
n re ! ief . because the blood is constantly circulating through the system
loaded with these filthy catarrhal poisons, and it must be purified and cleansed
JÂ» before a cure can be effected. S. S. S., a purely vegetable remedy, cures Catarrh

strong, and as it circulates through the system it carries healthful properties to the organs and tender tissues,
the unhealthy secretions cease, and the whole system is renewed and built up by it. Don't let a "bad cold"
become chronic Catarrh, but at the fi?st sym Â»om begin the use of S. S. S. and fortify the system against it Our

SOUBRA TAKES
MEMBERS'STAKE
Last Event of Field Trials
Goes to Keller's Clever
Little English Setter
BURBANK RUNS SECOND
Meet Proves to Be the Most
Successful in the His
tory of Sportsmen's Club
BY ASSHETOX SMYTH.
v Special Dispatch to Tho Call.
BAKERSFIELD, Jan. 14.âThe twen
ty-second annual meet of the Paciflo
Coast Field Trials Club passed into
history to-day with the running of the
Members' stake, in which the dogs
were handled by their owners. The
trials have been the most successful in
the history of the club. The Members'
stake was won by H. W. Keller's Eng
lish setter Sombra, with J. W. Flynn's
pointer Burbank second. Sombra is by
Llewellyn Drake-Shadow. Monterey,
winner of third place, is a little brother
to Sombra.
The first brace put down was Sombra
and Burbank. A few birds had been
marked down in some wild sunflowers
and the dogs were sent after them.
Sombra soon pointed, backed by Bur
bank. She followed this by another
point, and again with a flush, working j
out into the open, with a strong wind j
blowing. Sombra caught scent and
wheeled to a point just as the birds |
flushed. A little later Sombra pointed.
again, with Burbank backing in good
style.
Burbank while running in the Derby .
made a number of points, but on this
occasion he failed to locate any birds.
Hopkins' lemon and white English
setter Rose Ohn and Milt Donley's
Monterey were the next brace down.
They were marked through timber and
heavy grass. Monterey soon scored a
point, which he held well. Moving on to
where the cover was still more dense,
he located another single, which his
handler after considerable trouble suc
ceeded in flushing. Rose Ohn is an
untrained dog, having seen birds but
once before. She was entered by her
handler purely for the pleasure of par
ticipating in the Members' stake.
S. Christensen's black, white and tan
English setter Bell Fontaine ran a bye
with Merry Heart, handled by Judge
C. N. Post of Sacramento. Judge Post
was que of the first patrons of the
sport, having handled his own dog in
the first and ln many of the succeeding'
trials of the club. After the stake had
been decided the sportsmen went be
yond the preserve ground in quest of
quail.
W. W. Van Arsdale, S. Christensen,
Frank H. Jermyn, H. W. Keller, J. W.
Flynn, Howard Smith, Lieutenant
Woods and others were afield. Dr. C.
W. Hibbard and John B. Haver en
joyed a shoot over the champion point
er, Dr. Daniels, which was handled by
the trainer. C. H. Babcock. The great
dog was in fine form* and it was a de
light to shoot over him. W. W. Rich
ards and Dr. A. M. Barker made a pil
grimage to Lakeside after ducks, but
they picked up only a few birds.
STANFORD ATHLETES
READY FOR HARD WORK
Training Begins To-Morrow and As
pirants Will Have to l cad the .
Simple Life.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 14.
Regular training on the Stanford track
will begin on Monday. Nearly a hun
dred athletically inclined students
have signed "Dad" Moulton's train
ing rules, under which they abstain
from the use of tobacco, alcoholic
liquor, late hours and dancing. The
work of the track man is no bed of
roses anywhere, but this season work
at Stanford will be particularly hard,
as constant training will be required
in all events to develop possible point
winners.
As usual Stanford will be weak in
jlhe two-mile run. At this time there
seems to be no one who can get a
place in that event. Miller, a fresh
man from Bakersfleld, will run the
mile under four minutes and forty
seconds-and ought to win that event.
Stanford will be strong in the half,
but weak in the quarter mile. The
Bprlnts should both go to California in
the intercollegiate meet. In the field
events the cardinals will be strong.
The jumps will go to Stanford and
possibly the pole .vault. Crawford
should again win the hammer throw
and Horton seems likely to equal Hyde
in the shot put.
Stanford will suffer a little because
the meet is to be held on the Cali
fornia track. Trainer "Dad" Moulton
will take the men to Berkeley several
times before the final contests so as
to acquaint them with the track and
the runways. In the meantime field
days will be held on the Stanford cam
pus each week.
CARDINAL BALL TOSSERS
GETTING READY FOR FRAY
Coach Oowden Hopes to Develop a
Strong Team by Plenty of
Practice.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan. 14.
Baseball practice will begin on the
Stanford diamond next Monday and
from that time until the final inter
collegiate games with the University
of California daily contests will take
place under the eyes of Coach Cow
den. First work will be done with
the freshmen, as the baby intercol
legiate game comes first. The inter
class games will be played early so as
to leave plenty of time for the de
velopment of splendid team work on
the varsity.
Stanford will not have a veteran
nine to start with. Of last year's team
four men are back in college and of
these three were new players last sea
son. Sales will pitch and with good
coaching should prove strong. Cap
tain Trowbridge is back at shortstop,
Colbert at first and Chalmers ln left
field. To fill the vacant positions are
Scott, catcher; Daily, catcher; Dudley,
inflelder; Funke, inflelder âall mem
bers of last year's second team, and a
score of freshmen players.
Coach Cowden believes that frequent
games will develop a baseball team,
so the varsity will play every Saturday
during the season. Batting practice
will be run through dally. James
Lanagan, the football coach, who
pitched for Stanford during two sea
sons, will probably coach the pitchers.
Diavolo Fatally Hurt.
HAVANA, Jan. 14.âDr. Clark,
known as "Diavolo," a bicyclist, during
a performance a* Cienfuegos to-day,
waa probably fatally injured. While
alighting after a leap his bicycle
broke, smashing Diavolo's face and
fracturing his skull.

books, ran seven furlongs in l:2o\_ and
won the Santa Catalina selling stakes
at Ascot to-day. This race waa the
feature of a splendid card and was
worth ?1470 to the winner. Luckett was
second and Cerro Santa third. Prin
cess Tulnne was the favorite, Cerro
Santa second choice and Luckett third
choice. Santa set a terrific pace, but
tired in the last hundred yards, and
Payne and Luckett beat him out.
There was a bad spill just at the
finish of the fifth race. Sais and Elie
fell opposite the Judges' stand, but
both horses and riders almost miracu
lously escaped injury. In a driving
finish all through the stretch, with
Sais and Elie running stride for stride,
Schoolmate, Ralph Young and Rough
Rider came up on the outside. School
mate bore in, forcing all the others
toward the inside fence.
When just under the wire Sais went j
down and Elie fell over him. Chan- j
cellor leaped over both horses. Moriar- j
ily and Miller were stunned, but were i
not injured. Scbjoolmate won from
Ralph Young and Rough Rider, in the
order named. For allowing Schoolmate
to cut in on the other horses Dugan,
his rider, was fined $250. It was a dis
astrous day for favorites, Helgerson,

are our brother's jailkeepers." And
then he launched upon the horrors of
the course pursued of imprisoning boys
in the jails with hardened criminals.
Hi told how this frightful evil, as he
regards it, had been corrected in New
York after many years of battling.
The principal efforts of charity, the
speaker said, would be directed by him
to helping the children, many as
young as four or five years, who are
compelled to work in factories in this
country. "There are 2,000,000 children
working in our shops to-day," he de
clared. "You are forging chains for
yourselves that you will not easily
strike off," was his warning against
allowing womanhood and manhood to
develop under such conditions.
"The children must play. Child's play
is an important factor in the educa
tion. It took New York a long time
to recognize this. But the superintend
ent of our school system has now de
clared that the playground is as im
portant as the teaching of the lessons.
Until your superintendent carries out
the same policy, that play is an es
sential factor In the education of the
child, your school system will fall far
short of best results.
A QUESTION OF INTEREST.
"As to the slum or the tenement
problem there would be no problem
at all if the landlord would be content
with 4 or 5 per cent instead of greed
ily demanding 20 per cent."
Mr. Riis closed his address with a
discourse on charity. He deprecated

My SIO Guaranteed Paddock Special
Grasscutter>l,won
ORASSCUTTER was the one horse that I handed out to all my
clients yesterday as my $10 Guaranteed Paddock Special. This is what
my message said:
"GHASSCUTTER is my Guaranteed Paddock Special. This filly beat SIR
WILFRED in her work and can lly in the mud. IS A SURE WINNER. Bet all you
can beg or borrow on her!"
GRASSCUTTER had never started in her life before. T had held
a watch on her in her morning trials. 1 knew that she had been per
fectly schooled to the barrier. I knew she was as fast as a ghost
and could fly in the mud. More than that. I had seen her beat SIR
WILFRED when the pair worked together in private, and as SIR
WILFRED had beaten every colt and filly Grasscutter was to meet
I had an absolute line that stamped GRASSCUTTER a SURE WIN
NERâand my message said so.
NO WIN-NO PAY!

Fear of Tariff Revision and
Congressional Action on

âÂ« âÂ«
NEW YORK. Jan. 14. âThe sudden
revival of animation in Union Pacific
which stirred the late stock market
yesterday was continued to-day, send
ing the price of the stock to 119 %.
Northern Securities on the curb went
to a new high record in company.
There were floods of rumors of sup
posed plans for readjustment of the
railroad situation, growing out of the
disintegration of the company, but the
only actual news was the tip circu
lated from uptown speculative quar
ters that Union Pacific was to touch
120 to-day. There was a strong sym
pathetic movement in Southern Pacific
and St. Paul. There was large buying
of United States Steel preferred and
Amalgamated Copepr also. ,
Elsewhere in the list the strength
was moderate and there was some
pressure to realize on the advance.
This was especially manifest after the
appearance of the very strong bank
statement. Not only was the large in
flow of currency from the interior for
the week reflected in the statement,
but also that of last week, which failed
to show In last week's statement owing
to local shifting of cash holdings. As
a result this week's statement shows
a growth of over $15,000,000 in cash
holdings. There was at the same time
a contraction of $5,406,900 in the
loan account. The net result was to
bring up the surplus over legal reserve
requirements by $12,851,025. This
accumulation, coming on the ex
tremely easy money market, is likely
to enhance the outgo of gold, to which
is soon to be added remittances to
Cuba for the final installment on final
subscriptions to the Cuban loan, which
may call for upward of $10,000,000.
Excited buying of Union Pacific pulled
up its related stocks to the top level
toward the end of the session, but
realizing made at other points made
the closing irregular and very active.
Total sales of bonds to-day, par value,
$4,915,000.
FEELING THE MARKET.
Stocks have backed and filled this
week on a small volume of dealings
which has comprised little more than
the tentative operations of professional
truders to And the cause of the market.
There has been no real motive power
in the market owing to profound neg
lect by powerful trading interests and
the outside public. Much discussion of
the causes of the lack of interest in
the market has failed to bring about
any general agreement, but a number
of contributory causes have been com
monly accepted. The sensitiveness of
speculative sentiment to the settle
ment of the legislative programme at
Washington emerges with tolerable
clearness.
Thus prices advanced with some de
cision on Monday morning when it
was generally reported that the Satur
day conference of political leaders had
resulted in an agreement that it would
not be practicable to undertake any
prominent new measures at the pres
ent session of Congress. On the other
hand, the most distinct decline of the
occurred on Thursday, when the
traders were confronted with the ex
plicit report that the President had
determined to press for prompt action
a measure for the fixing of railroad
rates by Federal authority.
The financial district has its varieties
ot sentiment on the merits of the
measures proposed. Aside from the
eftect on securities which would be
subject to special influences by
changes in tariff schedules, especially
during the period of discussion upon
those changes, the readjustments in
both which go with changes in rates
of duties are expected to beget
hesitation for a time. Another feat
ure of the outlook which causes un
certainty is the measure of the future
resources of the money market to the
new capital issues which are be
lieved to be forthcoming In large vol
ume.
The funding of the large issues of
short time notes made by the railroads
last year during the period of "indi
gestion" of securities is to be provided
for. These funding operations will
not provide new capital to the rail
roads, as the proceeds of the notes
have been mostly expended and addi
tional issues are looked for to pro
vide resources for continuing outlay.
SHIPPING OF GOLD.
The present extremely easy condition
of the money market seems to promise
advantageous conditions for the com
ing flotations. But factors are at work
which may modify the usual accumu
lation of banking reserves in New
York in the first part of the year.
There is no present limit in sight to
the outgo of gold from New York,
which is in progress toward Paris,
South America and to Japan. It is
urged that any demand for loans which
would raise the money rate would
promptly stop these various move
ments, which are due to special in
ducements In the way of allowance for
interest. But the sentimental effect of
exports of gold is felt, as is invariably
tlje case. Some weight must be given
to the course of recent events in the
banking world, at least in their in
fluence upon the public mind.
This week's run on a bank doing
business among the foreign population
on the east side of the city was at
tributed by an official of the bank to
the sensational Interest attaching to
the story of Mrs. Chadwick's
exploits and to the discussion
of the alleged practice of over
certification of checks / by the great
downtown banks, which was awakened
by the testimony in a lawsuit growing
out of the exploiting of a mining stock
in the curb market.
It cannot be said that the financial
world itself is in any state of dis
quietude over banking practices, over
the stock market or the practice among
banks through the country. But the
effect which has been produced upon
public sentiment by the prominence
given to these episodes is recognized
as detrimental to the stock market. In
dustries are reported to be expanding.
Railroad officials anticipate more traf
fic offering than can be carried; the
consumption of pigiron continues to
grow, and various enlarged disburse

BIG DEMAND FOR SPACE
AT PORTLAND EXPOSITION
Management Finds It Necessary to
Construct New Liberal Arts Build
ing to Accommodate Exhibitors.
PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. 14. âA large
number of former residents of Michi
gan have organized the Michigan So
ciety of Oregon to co-operate with the
State of Michigan in making an ex
hibit and to welcome all Mlchiganers
at the Lewis and Clark Exposition.
Bids are being _advertised for the
construction of a new liberal arts
building, the erection of which was
made necessary owing to the exposi
tion having accepted applications for
many thousand more feet of space
than was available in the foreign ex
hibits building and former liberal arts
palace.
The new edifice will contain 90,000
square feet and will cost $50,000. The
old liberal arts building has been
turned over to the foreign exhibitors
and will be called the European ex

ART TREASURES
COME TO LIGHT
Raphael's "Holy Family"
Is Supposed Finallly to
Be Located in England
MANY COPIES EXIST
Picture Was Once Owned by
King Charles the First
and Sold by Cromwell
An interesting- new chapter has
been added to the romance of mas
terpieces by the discovery in London
of what is thought to be a long lost
original by Raphael. He painted in
the last year of his short life a "Holy
Family," which waa regarded by suc
ceeding generations as one of the best
of hiÃ works. Several versions of it
have long been known under the title
of "La Madonna del Passeggio," or
"Our Lady of the Wayfaring," the
best of them being at Bridgewater
House, but all these are thought to be
copies by Raphael's pupils.
Lately, however, T. Crome of Cros
by Square has come into possession of
a picture which, after much research,
he considers to be the veritable "Holy
Family" that Raphael himself painted
ln 1619-20 for Isabella Gonaaga,
Marchioness of Mantua.
The canvas, measuring 28 by 19
inches, represents the Virgin, dressed
in a rich red robe, with the infant
Christ and the infant St. John the
Baptist, who stands at her feet. Be
yond them to the left is St. Joseph,
who is descending a hill toward a
broad valley, and turns to look back
at the group. Mr. Crome, who was
good enough to show the picture to a
Daily Chronicle representative ln the
city yesterday, relates the following
particulars of its romantic history:
The late owner of the picture ac
quired It, as well as a "Flight Into
Egypt," by Rubens, from the execu
tors of Colonel Landmann, R. E., who
fought in the peninsular war. How
he came into possession of these
works appears from a paper left by
him, which runs thus:
"In the year 1811 I waa stationed
by Lord Liverpool, Secretary for the
War Department, at Corunna, with a
special commission from the King to
keep his lordship informed on all
military and diplomatic matters which
could assist him in forming a correct
knowledge of the state of the war ln
the peninsula. â 
"The position I then held necessarily
placed me in direct correspondence
with the Duke of Wellington and the
leading commander of the guerrilla
parties then scattered over the north
of Spain. Of these the celebrated Gen
eral Mina was one of the most daring
and most successful.
"Toward the latter part of 1811 I re
ceived from Mina a box containing pic
tures, which he had captured from an
escort carrying them to Paris to be
placed in the gallery_of the Louvre and
requesting me to dispose of the said
pictures among my English friends and
lay out the proceeds in shoes and other
clothing, to be sent to him for the use
of his troops.
"I was unwilling to take the respon
sibility of the sale on myself, therefore
called in a merchant named Sains to
fix the price, which I thought was
moderate, and took them myself, and
desired Sains to complete Mina's re
quest."
Going a stage further back, Mr.
Crome has found that a "Holy Fam
ily," by Raphael, answering precisely
to the description of his picture, waa
in the King of Spain's collection in
1776 and in 1793, but is not mentioned
in any Inventories later than the pen
insular war. He concludes, therefore,
that the French commander at Madrid
had taken it from the royal gallery,
and was sending it to the Louvre, when
by chance It fell into Mina's hands.
The next step backward ln the his
tory of the picture brings us to the
famous collection formed by Charles
I, and sold by order of the common
wealth after that luckless monarch's
execution. Mr. Crome identifies his
picture with the small Raphael that
hung in the King's bed chamber at
Whitehall and was described by Van
derdoort thus: "Item, at the bedside
Our Lady XL and St. John, little en
tire figures half so large as the life."
It was sold at the auction for Â£800,
and Mr. Crome conjectures that the
purchaser waa the Spanish Embasaa-
a. m. train from Third and Towneend streets
depot.

Trying Times for Lizzie.
Lizzie Henry, one of the City Prison's
"old timers," while in an Inquisitive
mood last- evening, forced her head
through the bars of her cell in order
to talk more freely with a chum locked
up ln an adjoining cell. When Lizzie
attempted to withdraw her head she
discovered that lt could not be budged
and she let out a wild shout for help.
For three hours the prison keepers and
matt on endeavored to get the head of
the woman back into the cell, but
with no success, until the matron con
ceived the idea of shaving the hair off
Lizzie's isolated caput and then by
pressing the prisoner's ears close to her
head the latter was restored to its cus
tomary uprightness.

PROFITS IN HANDLING
COPRA AND COCOANUT OIL
Marseilles Enjoyes Virtual Monopoly
of the Trade and Finds New
Uses for Products.
United States Consul General Robert
P. Skinner, at Marseilles, writes to Sec
retary Hay that the merchandise
known as copra ls the meat of the
cocoanut, from which oil is extracted
in all countries where the cocoanut
palm crows. The same material is
shipped in large quantities to Mar
seilles. The nut is broken by hand,
the meat is extracted and either dried
ln kilns, as ln the Philippine Islands,
or in the sun, as in Cochin, China. The
oil ls generally used for the manufac
ture of soap, but of late years methods
of refining it have been perfected, with
the result that a considerable propor
tion of the Marseilles oil is now sold for
alimentary purposes.
The inquiry as to the cost of work
ing copra is difficult to answer satis
factorily, Marseilles manufactur
ers have made very large profits dur
ing the last four or five years. This
has been true of manufacturers of all
grades of vegetable oils as well. In a
period of general stagnation the best
equipped manufacturers have made
handsome fortunes in a single year.
The present cost of copra In Marseilles
ls: Ceylon, $85 16 a ton; Manila and
Singapore, $83 94 a ton.
Copra is not treated to a first and
second pressing, as are most oil seeds.
The raw material is first passed through
a cylinder press, very much as paper
is fed from an endless roll through the
revolving cylinders of a printing press.
The pulpy mass issuing therefrom ls
then treated in a box press, and no dis
tinction Is made between the oils re
sulting from the two processes. The
high-grade oils are obtained by clarifi
cation and filtration, ln regard to which
little really satisfactory information
can be obtained. The method was
guarded as a secret by one firm for
some time, but at present several firms
claim to be turning out equally good
edible oil.
From 62 to 63 per cent of oil is ob
tained from the raw material. Two
hundred pounds of copra properly
handled should produce approximately
124 pounds of oil and seventy-four
pounds of cake. The ordinary soap oil
Is now quoted at $12 82 for 220 pounds;
the best Cochin oil at $13 89 for 220
pounds. Copra oil cake Is very seldom
treated by chemical process, as it finds
a ready sale for stock-feeding pur
puses. White copra cake is now worth
$3 04, and ordinary cake $2 31 for 220
pounds.âNew York Commercial.
Warships.
We are not surprised to hear that
the British Government will soon re
tire some forty vessels which now fig
ure on paper as part of the Imperial
navy. According to a statement of Ad
miral Beresford made in Parliament a
few years ago the process of elimina
tion might be carried much further
without serious diminution of Eng
land's naval strength. It is no secret
that a very considerable proportion of
the fleet possesses only a Pickwickian
significance in any serious computa
tion, and one need not be an expert to
perceive that no real harm
to Great Britain as the result of a
sweeping reformation. â Washington

SWAINS MUST BE WATCHFUL,
GIRLS GROWING SCARCE
Stork's Marked Preference for Boy
Babies Shown by United States
Census Returns.
There will not be sweethearts for all
the boy babies in the United States un
less the births of girls increase. The
young man who believes that he haa
an affinity somewhere by right would
better watch out or some other of the
216 more young men than women in
every 10,000 population may jump In
and win that affinity.
"When Professor Willcox of Cornell
University was figuring out the propor
tion of sexes in the United States for
the Census Bureau he dealt solely with
the figures without regard to sentiment,
and has found that ln continental
United States there are 1,638,321 more
males than females, or about two more
males than females In every hundred
population.
The fact that he arrives on ssi \U
more frequently than the girl is net th*
only hard luck that attends being s
mere man. The woman lives longer
than he does, the death rate ls higher
among males than females and more
girls go to school than boys.
The man seeking a wife should go tÂ»
the city rather than the country, tor
there he is more likely to find what hm
wants.
The Census Bureau and the professor
of Cornell University do not mean that
city women make better wives than
country girls, but if a wife seeker goes
to the city he has about three chances
out of 500 the best of it, while ln the
country the girl who ls looking for a
husband ha? about twenty chances the
best of it ln 500.
In 1890 ln the 1490 cities in the United
States having a population of 2500 or
more there were but 6929 more males
than females, while in 1900 this excess
of 6929 males became an excess of 210,
--959 females.
The excess of 1,519,559 males ln ooun
try districts in 1890 increased to 1,840,
--280 males in 1900, and it is from these
that the green goods men draw their
customers.
In continental United States the rela
tive excess of males is greater than the
average for all countries. Europe has
an excess of females; every other conti
nent so far as known has an excess of
males.
All the figures collected by the Cen
sus Bureau show that boy babies are
born oftener in the country than in
cities. -In cities the figures are 60S males
to each 1000 children, and 506 males to
each 1000 children in the country.
Notwithstanding the great excess of
males in the total population of the
United States there are two periods of
life at which the reported number of
females is greater.
One extending from about 83 years of
age to the end of life, is probably due
mainly to the longer average life of
women: the other, from 16 to 25, is
probably apparent rather than real and
due mainly to the greater number of
women who tell fibs and claim to be
long to this age period.
Among the negroes there are a few
more females than males; among the
.Indians a few more males than fe
i males.âChicago Inter Ocean*COMMERCIAL mM FINANCIAL 1

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Jan. 14.ânotwithstanding a*"
slight decline at Liverpool, Vie wheat market
opened strong, with May up %@%c to %@
%c at $1 16%@1 16%. Shorts and commission
houses were active bidders, but actual trading
for a time was comparatively light. The re
sult was a further advance in May to $1 17Vi
Â©1 17%. The strength waa attributed partly
to an advance in outside markets yesterday
after the session here had, closed. Among In
fluences that helped bring out the Improved
demand were predictions of a decrease in
world's shipments. The prevailing cold weath
er throughout the United States was, however,
the chief factor, lt being expected that the
cold would furnish an additional check to the
movement of wheat from the farms. Receipts
to-day proved that this expectation was not
without some foundation, primary receipts be
ing 470,000 bushels, compared with 720,400
bushels a year ago. Late In the day a sharp
break occurred on fairly liberal profit taking
by several Influential houses. May quickly
sold off to $1 16%<g>l 16%. On the decline
shorta were active buyers and there was an
other rally ln prices. The market was quite
firm at the close, with May at $1 16%.
The corn market. Influenced by weak cables
snd poor export demand, opened some vh at
easier, but developed a firmer tone. May
closed at 44% c.
Small receipts gave a firm tone to the oats
market early in the day, but later the market
eased oft* somewhat on a lack of demand. May
closed at 31%@31%0.
Provisions were quiet and steady. At the
close May pork was off 2%c: lard waa down

Butter, Cheese ;uid Esrgs.
The steadier feeling in Bttttar alieafiv noted
ils becoming more apparent, ni?d while the:e
;is no improvement in prices, stocks arc -mailer
1 and the demand is better. Very littie com
plaint of large stocks or dull trade is njw
: her.rd. As a good deal of cold storage Butter
; hs.e. been shipped East during the past six
weeks, stocks of thla description are much
lighter and the demand for the medium and
lower grades of fresh is showing marked Im
provement ln consequence. The whole Butter
situation ls much better than tt was a few
days ago. There is no particular change in
Cheese.
i The downward tendency ln Eggs continues,
â  though the decline Is gradual. The present
' softer and molater weather is very favorable
'to an increased production, and the market
; is already showing the effects of the Improved
; temperature. A number of large houses were
offering flne ranch at 28c yesterday, and store
Eggs were especially weak.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
I Trade ln Citrus fruits continued quipt, as
i dealers were not laying in extra supplies for
: Sunday, as they usually do at the close of the
week, and prices of all descriptions were un
i changed. Standard Navels were steady at the
! old quotations, stocks of that grade being light,
: but all other kinds were plentiful and weak.
; Apples ruled firm at rising prices and there
were some liberal withdrawals from Icehouse.
Supplies of Pears in local storage plants are
exhausted, and as there are no more coming
in from the growing districts the quotations
are withdrawn. Tropical fruits were in good
supply and quiet at unchanged rates.

Ml Ding, an employe of the Santa Fe

stupor, which local physicians have
been utterly at a loss to explain. He
dropped off to sleep yesterday morn

of coma, which, judging from past ex
periences, will probably last several
days.
This is the sixth or seventh recur

afflicts Stibing. It is always preceded
by a severe headache, and do what he
will he cannot shake off the feeling of
drowsiness which culminates in a
sleep of several days and leaves him in
a somewhat exhausted condition, but
otherwise none the worse for the ex
perience. He ls aroused at times to
mechanically partake of a little nour
ishment and again relapses into sleep.
