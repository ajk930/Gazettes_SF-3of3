MOSCOW STRIKERS PREPARING TO RESIST
TROOPS AND CITY MAY BE SACKED.
QUARTER OF A MILLION MEN WILL OPPOSE THE CZAR'S SOLDIERS
MOSCOW, Jan. 24.âStrike leaders, under the direction of the Social Democrats, have arranged for a great demonstration to
morrow, similar to that which led to the bloodshed in St. Petersburg on Sunday. Warnings issued by the authorities are being ignored
and the workmen are preparing to resist the troops. It is expected that within twenty-four hours the strikers here will number a quarter
of a million men. It is feared that they will overpower the military and that the city will be sacked.

The revenue cutter Dexter has been I
dispatched to Mayaguez for the pur
pose oÂ£ intercepting an expedition
carrying arms and ammunition to
Santo Domingo for the leaders of a
contemplated revolution.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2 4.âln carry
ing out the plan by which this coun
try is to assume control of Santo
Domingo's finances, President Roose
velt is proceeding to practically take
charge of the island with a powerful
fleet of warships. This feature of the
programme has been conducted with
much secrecy, and it was with great
reluctance that the facts finally were
officially admitted this afternoon.
Rear Admiral Sigsbee, commanding
the Caribbean division of the North
Atlantic fleet, is at Santo Domingo
with his full squadron, which consists
of the flagship Newark, the cruiser
Detroit, the gunboat Castine and the
collier Sterling. The torpedo-boat
Stewart reached Santo Domingo to
day, but its arrival, for some reason
that was not explained, was not men
tioned in the daily list of ship move
ments issued by the Navy Department.
The Stewart, it is said, will be used as
a dispatch boat, and other torpedo
* boats may be sent there for the samfe
purpose. The new cruisers Tacoma
and Denver have been ordered to join
Admiral Sigsbee's squadron and will
arrive at Santo Domingo In a few
days. Further reinforcement of the
squadron with cruisers and gunboats
is being considered, and it is probable
that two or three more ships will be
sent.
With the fleet now and on its
â way one -shin could be assigned to
each of the seven principal ports of
the island, but it is der-ired to have
warship in place of the collier and
gunboat in place of the torpedo-boat.
The naval forces will be used to
overawe the rebellious natives, who
are in practical possession of three
of the nothern ports, and firmly to es
tablish the American dictatorship.
The warships will practically take pos
session of all ports on February 1,
when the protocol signed by President
Morales and Commander * Dillingham
goes into effect. The result will be to
strengthen the Morales Government,
and, It is expected, to prevent any re
sistance in carrying the protocol into
effect.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
, NSSW. YORK, ;Tnn. 54.--W**n the RM '
Star liner Vaderland arrived from Ant
werp to-day she reported ten deaths,
caused by seasickness on the voyage.
The victims were all steerage passen
gers, all were males, their ages ranging
from fifteen to forty years. Eight of
the bodies were buried at sea. The
bodies of two who had died just before
the Vaderland reached port are still on
board.
Captain Ehoff says that while the
weather was- extremely rough for the
first five days out from Antwerp, it was
no worse than the usual run of Atlantic
weather in midwinter. There were
j high gales and squalls of sleet and
I snow, but all vessels have been en
i countering these conditions.
Ehoff attributes the many deaths to
j the fact that the immigrants had come
!on board poorly fed, poqrly clad, still
' further debilitated by a long railroad
! ride, all having come from a distant
province in Hungary, and therefore
were in no condition to withstand the
rigors of an Atlantic voyage. This is
borne out by the testimony of two
members of the medical profession, who
j were among the saloon passengers and
I who were called In consultation by Dr.
Woersegers, the surgeon of the Vader-
I land. They are Dr. Sidney K. Simon,
:of New Orleans, and Dr. William
i Ackermann, of Milwaukee. They sign
!ed a paper which read:
"This is to certify that upon the re
i quest of the authorities on board this
; steamship, we, the undersigned, made
j an examination of many of the patients
and an Inspection of their quarters and
; found the latter in the best of condi
! tion. To the best of our knowledge, we
i believe the fatalities to be due to ex
j haustion attending a rough voyage."
FLOATING FOUNDATIONS
IMPERIL BIG BLOCKS
Obstacle In the Way of| the Proposed
Subway System in
Chicago.
CHICAGO, Jan. 24.â"Floating foun
dations" support sixty-four of the
large downtown buildings of Chicago.
This fact came to light to-day when
an inquiry was made following a dis
cussion of August Belmont's assertion
that Chicago's problem of subway con
struction was easier than that of New
York. G. W. Jackson and other engi
neers pointed out that In the very
"cheeEe-cutting" ease of digging into
the sub-surface of the city lay the
peril here. Jackson said:
"A slight miscalculation would dam
age and perhaps Ibause the collapse of
83 per cent of the office buildings in
the downtown district."
It is pointed out that under ordinary
conditions "floating foundations" are'
safe, but they complicate the subway
problem.

Special Cable to The Call and the New York Herald, Copyright, 1905, by

ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 24âOver Gatsch.ina Palace no
imperial flag is waving, and rumors were rife to-night that the
Czar and Czarina had suddenly left for Livadia, .in the Crimea;
but in response to inquiries a court dignitary, who-refused to give
any positive information respecting the whereabouts of the Em
peror, assured me that the rumor was groundless.
I am informed on excellent authority th# the principal Mm*
* ister.s are wholly out of sympathy with the' acts of personages who
have been responsible for the public order since Saturday night.
They wash their hands of everything, but, lacking the means ot
expressing this publicly, they assure their friends that they con
demn the whole course adopted by the Government since Satur
day evening, when the Emperor, hearing of the intention- of the
workmen and having listened to the suggestions of Grand Dukes
Vladimir and Sergius, approved the policy of "firmness" recom
mended by his relatives and definitely took his stand against the
men who are now known to be the spokesmen of the whole Rus
sian nation.

who was the head of the police down to Saturday last, remarked

SAN FRANCISCO, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 25, 1905.
WILL THE ASSAULT OF THE RUSSIAN POPULACE UPON AUTOCRACY SUCCEED?
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 24.âSt. Petersburg will be declared In a state of
siege to-morrow". General Trepoff, until recently Chief of Police of Mos
cow, has been appointed Governor General of St. Petersburg and has taken
up quarters In the Winter Palace. Strangely enough, the only precedent is
the case of General Trepoff's father during the reign of Nihilistic terrorism
under Alexander* 11, and it is also a strange coincidence that unsuccessful
attempts were made on the lives of both. General Trepoff Is a man of
great energy, but the measures he adopted at Moscow for suppressing the
student demonstrations in December last provoked much resentment, and
the revolutionists recently condemned him to death.
The aspect of the Russian capital is decidedly more calm. Business, which
had been at a complete standstill, has been resumed upon a limited scale.
The employes in a few of the smaller factories went back to work to-day,
and the crowds of strikers in the streets were diminished. The troops in
evidence were not so numerous as on Monday, and a more confident feeling
exists in official circles that the energetic measures which have been insti
tuted will ensure the safety and quiet of the city.
Beneath the surface, however, the ferment continues, and the public nerv
ousness and apprehension as to future developments is still unallayed.
Secret meetings of different classes in opposition to the existing order of
things were held in various places during the afternoon and evening, but
the divergent elements which were suddenly brought together by the tragic
events of last Sunday are advancing on divergent plans, and no common
ground of action has yet been found.
. In the meantime the police are actively searching out the leaders. ThreÂ«
well-known Russian authors and a prominent editor were arrested to-day,
and the prisons are filled with agitators, revolutionists and student orators.
Such measures may result in bomb-throwing and terrorism to-morrow, but
the consensus of opinion is that the immediate future actions of the agita
tors depend upon what occurs in Moscow and other large cities of Russia
where the workmen are beginning to strike.
More than 100,000 men are out in the old capital of the empire to-night.
A telephone message from Moscow at midnight reported that there had

been no disorder there as yet. There will be a big demonstration In Moscow
to-morrow, and it is feared that it will be accompanied by bloodshed.
The situation confronting the military authorities in Moscow Is much
more serious than that in St. Petersburg. Out of more than 1,000,000 in
habitants of Moscow more than two-thirds are workmen, including an ex
ceedingly rough and turbulent element. The troops there are fewer and
the city does not lend itself, like. St. Petersburg, to natural barriers to
prevent the congregation of men. The center of the town has no bridges
and no canals, and hills and narrow streets make it difficult for troops
to act. Only the gates piercing the walls of the old Chinese town which
surrounds the Kremlin would afford the military natural places to bar
demonstrators.
At Kolvno and Vilna, where strikes have been begun, the workmen are
following the St. Petersburg plan of marching about the city and induc
ing or forcing other workmen to leave their employment. '
The windows and doors of practically every shop and residence in St.
Petersburg are boarded up, and at midnight the streets, as on Monday night,
were completely deserted, except for troops.
During the day there was a great crop of sensational rumors, includ
ing stories of strikers marching on Kolpino to seize the small arms fac
tory there and of the assassination of General Fullon, the prefect of St.
Petersburg, all of which on investigation have turned out to be false.
The inhabitants have again been warned to remain indoors.
It is not known definitely whether Father Gopon, the leader of the
workmen, is in Moscow or in St. Petersburg. A proclamation said to em
anate from him has been distributed, Indicating that he has gone over
body and soul to the Social Democrats.
The proclamation declares that since the Emperor and the Emperor's
Ministers have refused to listen to the people's grievances and fired on
them, the Government has outlawed itself so that every man's hand should
be-against it, and calls upon the people to slay the outlaws and destroy the
Government, root and branch. It authorizes the men to use fiombs, dyna
mite and other weapons, invites students to join and absolves the soldiers
from their oath of fealty. The destruction of Government property is
recommended, but the proclamation requests the followers of Father Gopon
to spare private property and ransack only shops containing vlctuais and
arms, and urges all to continue the fight until they succeed in obtaining
a national assembly.

LONDON, Jan. 25.âThe London Daily Express has issued a 5 o'clock extra, in

HELSINGFORS, Finland, Jan. 24.âThousands of workmen joined in a demon

CABLE ENTRAPS
A BIG WHALE
Jaws of the Leviathan Get
Caught in Rubber Insula
tion and Monster Drowns
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Wash.. Jan. 24.âA whale,
in an endeavor to swallow the entire
Sitka end of the Alaskan cable, so
satiated himself with rubber, copper
and packing .that he lost all ambition
and drowned.This story came over
the cable in an official dispatch late
last night. It was signed by Major
Russell and' was for trans
mission to Washington.
The purport of the dispatch is that
th(. cableship Burnside," after leaving
Sitka for a point thirty miles north of
that port, Where the cable'was broken,
endeavored to lift the severed end of
the submarine wires, Â¥ The severed
ends were between submerged cliffs
and were difficult to raise. The men
o.i the cableship arranged their ap
paratus so that the Sitka end of the
sunken wire should be raised first.
â¢â¢'Attached to the great Government
cible, the packed wire imbedded firm
ly In its jaws so that Jt could not be
disentangled without great difficulty,
was a large whale. It had evidently
been rubbing its back against the large
submerged wire. In its playful
"stunts" it had endeavored to sever the
great wire and the rubber packing be
came firmly imbedded in its jaws. Un
able to get awp.y from, the packing
which adhered to its jaws, the whale
simply drowned. How long it had
been dead, Major Russell was unable
to state.

would be the very worst days in St. Petersburg, and that
the revolutionary masses probably would visit the private dwell
ings and take whatever they wanted., But, he added, they would
doubtless refrain from harming those who refused them nothing.
A number of wealthy young officials are leaving the city to
night in consequence of fears entertained that to-morrow the
trains may cease to run, and reports have reached us that in the
provinces, on several stretches of lin,e in Central Russia, especial
ly in the Government of Yula," the rails have been torn up by the
people, but again repaired by the troops.
\ Desperate attempts have been made and will be made by
workingmen to plunder the arsenal. They complain that without
arms they can accomplish nothing, and many intelligent support
ers of the revolution are beginning to fear that a temporary col
lapse of the movement is a question of two or three daysâ
a collapse, however, which may last three or four weeks at the
most, and culminate in far resonant occurrences.
The majority are less pessimistic, and point to the fact that
in two hours at one center alone a sum of Â£1250 ($6250) was
collected for the strikers and their families, by whom the pinch of
hunger was painfully felt.
An appeal for foreign help, which was drawn up by a prom
inent literary man, has not been put forward because of his arrest,
but I am enabled to state that the appeal, which would have
borne well-known signatures, requests British and American
newspapers to open subscriptions for the strikers and to send the
money to the office of the Russian journal Asvaboshdennie in
Paris or to the Vorwaerts in Berlin.

PEKING ISSUES A BOLD
DEFIANCE TO THE CZAR
China No Longer in
Fear of Musco
vite Power.
Denies All Charges
of Violations of
Neutrality.
c
Russia in Turn Ac

of Faith.
Special DUDatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24. â China has
struck back as vigorously as diplomacy
will permit at Russia's recent charges
that the Chinese Government has
countenanced flagrant pro-JapaneÃe
violations of neutrality. In a note
delivered to Secretary Hay, who was
slightly ill at his home to-day, by Sir
Chentung Liang Cheng, the Chinese
Minister, the Peking Government not
only vigorously and specifically denies
the Russian charges, but accuses Rus
sia of flagrant violations of Chinese
neutrality.
This note is surprisingly vigorous. for
a Chinese document. It is a bold diplo
matic challenge to Russia. Sir Chen -'
tung advised his Government last week
to say frankly whatever it had
and apparently his advice has been
followed.
This stiffening of the backbone of
the Peking Foreign Office is ascribed
to the growing Japanese* influence In
China. Half a dozen years ago, when
Chinese affairs were swayed â¢by a
clique of men at Peking, most of
whom were under Russian Influence,
the Russian charges would not have
evoked such a radical reply. Rut now
the voice of the Chinese people is
potent in Peking and Japanese â¢ influ-i
tnce is growing rapidly.
Secretary Hay will convey this note
to the President. A similar note will
be transmitted by China to air neutral
powers.
GIST OF CHINA'S ANSWER.
Regarding the charge that Chinese
bandits were enlisted In the Japanese
army, the Chinese Government call*
attention to the fact that they were
enlisted first by the Russian frontier
guards and fought against the Japan
ese army. If it is true, as alleged,
that they enlisted in the Japanese
army, that is a matter for the belliger
ents. The reply continues:
We find no Japanese officers in our northern
army at all. We do find in the Government
school at Paotingpu several Japanese trans
lators. All of them, however, had been en
gaged before the war, and after hostilities
broke out they were required to give their
word of honor to have nothing to do with the
conflict. These are on the same footing as
Russians and other foreigners in educational
Institutions throughout the empire and In our
maritime customs houses. China further re
gards this as a matter of Internal administra
tion of which no other Government has cause
to complain.
Regarding the iron ore said to have
been furnished the Japanese army, the
answer sayÃ this ore is from certain
mines owned by Chinese merchants,
separate from the Government mines
at Hanyang.
The Maotao Islands are said to have
been used by the Japanese as a base
for their navy. The Chinese Govern
ment for the last year has stationed
the swift cruiser Haiki to watch these
islands and the local prefect sum
moned the gunboat Haipu to patrol
these waters. No sign of any land
ing of Japanese has been reported to
the Government and it is unnecessary
to add that no such permission has
been given by the Chinese Govern
ment to Japan.
SHIPMENTS OF CONTRABAND.
Regarding the articles of contra
band alleged to have been sent to
Dalny, the answer says no ships have
left Chefu with the knowledge of the
Chinese Government for Dalny, and
no clearance papers for that port have
been issued by the Chinese customs
officials. If ships have run the block
ade that is the belligerents' lookout.
China is doing all she can to maintain
it.
Regarding the Ryeshitelhi incident,
it is stated that the seizure was as un
expected by the Chinese as by the
Russians. The Chinese Government
later requested Japan to return the
vessel and while the incident is not
yet closed, China considers that her
Government has done all possible in
the matter.
The Chinese Government considers
that Russia has violated neutrality in
a number of instances. Bridges have
been built by the Russians west of the
Laio River and Russian troops have
encamped on the west side of the
river, which is supposed to mark the
boundary of the neutral zone. In
many places in the neutral zone the
Russians have forced the sale of pro
visions. The Chinese have made many
arrests of Russians smuggling ammu
nition, arms and other contraband ar
ticles.

John Moore, an Aged Shoemaker, at
Hospital Dying as a Result of
Accident.
The cycle of street car accidents on
Market street seems not yet to have
been completed. The month of Jan
uary, although but two-thirds passed,
has witnessed more than a score of
cable car accidents. Two fatalities
Have resulted. Most of the accidents
seem to have been due to the careless
ness of pedestrians.
Last night John Moore, an aged
shoemaker, was run down by a
Haight-street car at Twelfth and Mar
ket streets and is dying from a frac
tured skull at the Central Emergency
Hospital. Dr. Herzog, who treated
the unfortunate man, does not hold
out a ray of hope for the patient's re
covery.
Moore, who is 73 years old, was on
his way to his home at 5 Tonningsen
place. He evidently did not hear the
approaching car, which was upon him
before the heavy vehicle could be
brought to a stop. Gripman Angus
Steuart was arrested and charged
with battery at the Mission police

Moore will die. He leaves a wife
and family.

Mr. and Mrs. Arnold Gundelfinger of
$3000 worth of jewelry on No

The paper says:
This official report does not come from the

BATTLES AND MASSACRES.
Correspondents Give Free Rein to
Vivid Imaginations.
LONDON, Jan. 25.âN0 report of al
leged occurrences in Russia appears
too wild or extravagant to find place
in some European journals. The free
dom accorded foreign correspondents
telegraphing from Russia,, as shown by
this fact, is the subject of remark in
the Daily Chronicle this morning as
indicating that Emperor Nicholas has
yet least one redeeming featureâa ca-
J pacity for keeping his word. The
Chronicle proceeds to refer to the
! promise of the Emperor to the Asso
j dated Press to complete the removal
of the censorship in news telegrams.
An instance of wild statements is in
I the Daily Mail's St. Petersburg dis
j patches, which describe a veritable
j battle between strikers and troops
) near Kolpino and a wholesale slaugh
ter of strikers.
The Daily Express' St. Petersburg
correspondent reports similar scenes of
massacre at Radom, and describes
General Kuropatkin's army as ripe for
revolt. .
There are conflicting: reports about
Maxim Gorky. The Stjsrhdard's St. Pe
tersburg correspondent says the novel
ist narrowly escaped capture, but the
Daily Telegraph's correspondent, who
was himself arrested but subsequently
released, says that Gorky was among
those arrested whose only crime con
sisted in having been members of the
delegation that visited Witte. president
of the Council of the Empire, after a
vain attempt to interview Minister of
the Interior Sviatopolk-Mirsky. They
are all, the correspondent adds, now
Interned in a secret section of the St.
Peter and St. Paul fortress. The cor
respondent says:
They are guilty of no illegal act except being
present at a meeting exceeding five persons.
Not one of them would have anything to do
wltti the secret committees or underground agi
tation. It was Â»hey who. In my presence, re
fused to listen to the suggestion that a perma
nent committee should be formed to direct a
'revolutionary movement. A young woman who
had been collecting money for hungry workmen
was arrested yesterday.
The Daily Telegraph's correspondent
adds:
I am enabled to state emphatically that

neither Witte nor Sviatopolk-Mirsky had any
Â»hand or part in the deeds of the last three
days, which they both sincerely deplore aa
blunders and crimes.
The Daily Chronicle's correspondent
at St. Petersburg also states that Min
ister of Finance Muravieff appealed to
the Emperor not to appoint General
Trepoff to the Governor Generalship of
the city" and government of St. Peters
burg or to declare the city in a state

SANTA FE TO ISSUE
$50,000,000 WORTH OF BONDS
Will Bear Interest at 4 Per Cent
and May Be Converted Into
Common Stock.
TOPEKA, Kans., Jan. 24.âPracti
cally no opposition was manifested at
the meeting of the stockholders of the
Santa Fe to-day to the proposition to
Increase the common stock of the com
pany and issue $50,000,000 of con
vertible bonds.
The purchasers of the issue of the
$f 0.000.000 of bonds will be allowed
the privilege ef converting the bonds
into common stock at any time the
holder chooses. The bonds will bear 4
per cent interest." The money received
from the sale of the bonds will be used
solely in building or acquiring actually
new and additional mileage or prop
erty.
President Ripley of the Santa Fe
announces that stockholders of the
road will have the first chance to buy
the $50,000,000 bonds. If any are left
they will be offered to the public.
Ripley said it might take ten years or
more to use the entire sum. Concern
ing the improvements to be made this
year, he said:
We will begin the construction of the Belen
cut-off, the Pecos Valley line will be gradually
improved, and the two together will be made a
through line. We wllUgradually transfer our
transcontinental business to that route, i'he
funds that will be placed at our disposal will
be available to use at any place on the whole
pystem. We will build considerable second
track this year. 1 am not ready to say what
additional shop facilities will be provided.
There have been no immediate provisions mads
as yet. Necessities will, of course, arise from
time to time.

Proclamations Call for Blood
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 24. â The
I lower section of the Nevsky Prospect,
including the Winter Palace district
and the quay, where the embassies are
located, is in darkness to-night, and
there has been a resumption of the
panicky feelinj? of yesterday. Never
theless the authorities express increas
ing confidence that the backbone of the
strike is broken and say that all the
prominent agitators and many extreme
Liberals have been arrested. Father
Gopon has disappeared and is said to
Ibe in Moscow directing the strike
I there.
For the moment the men here arÂ«
without a plan of action and are seem- j
ingly commencing to realize that with- |
out arms it is folly to resist the
troops. If the strikers are paralyzed I
there is general fear that the revolu- !
tionist3 and terrorists, who are com
ing to the front, will begin a reign of
bomb throwing, and that the political
exiles' association, known as the "Il
legal Red Cross," will make large con
tributions.
There is no truth in the report cir
culating that strikers 30,000 strong are
inarching upop Kolpine, twenty miles
from St. Petersburg, for the purpose
of seizing the small arms factory there, j
An official account of yesterday's
events Is as follows:
During Monday there were no collisions be
tween the rioters and the troops. Detach
ments of soldiers had no need to use their
arms, as the crowds dispersed when the
troops appeared. In the course of the day an
attempt was made to attack Gostinny Dvor
market, but it was repulsed.
Workmen at the electric stations joined the
strike in the evening. Then some groups, tak
ing advantage of darkness, began to break (
windows in the shops, but order was every
where quickly restored.
No person was killed or wounded on Mon
day. The exact number killed on Sunday was
86; Injured &Â«, of whom 53 were treated at
the ambulance stations.
FOREIGN BRS ARE FLEEING.
The terror of the people has been
somewhat relieved, but the dread of
the next few days continues. Many
foreigners are leaving Russia. The
foreign embassies are not manifesting
alarm. They are expressing confidence
that the Government will be able to
handle the situation, and that there is
nothing now warranting apprehension
for the lives or safety of their fellow
countrymen. The authorities insist
that the danger is exaggerated, con
tinuing to scout the idea of a revolu
tion and maintaining the ability of the
Government to meet all emergencies.
Early this morning a press corre
spondent drove up the Nevsky Pros
pect and found that the damage done
during the night to the store fronts
was greater than was apparent last
night. A large number of business
premises were wrecked, the mob hav
ing devoted Itself principally to con
fectioners and pastry cooks.
Enormous crowds of strikers and
many sightseers, encouraged by the
mild weather, were promenading the
sidewalks this morning and the street
cars were again in operation.
The correspondent noticed several
men distributing proclamations. The
people were formerly shy of accepting
such documents; now they are eagerly
taking them and have nicknamed
them "lastochke" (swallows), an allu
sion to the spring which has become a
synonym of evolution. The corre
spondent secured a number of copie%.
All are signed by 'The Russian Social
Democrat Labor Party." One procla
mation, dated January 22, reads:
ComradesâSo long as autocracy exists, no
Improvement tn our condition is possible;
therefore, we continue to Inscribe on our ban
ners the followins demands:
"The Immediate cessation of the war.
"Tlie summoning of . a constitutional assem
bly of representatives of the people elected by
universal and equal suffrage and by direct
secret ballot.
"The removal of class and race privileges
and restrictions.
"The inviolability of the person and domi
cile.
"Freedom of conversation, speech, the press,
meetings, strikes and political associations."
"LONG LIVE THE REVOLUTION."
A second proclamation, dated Janu
ary 23, says:
The proletarlal of all countries are united.
Citizens, you yesterday witnessed the bestial
cruelty of the autocracy. You saw blood flow
ing in the streets. You saw hundreds slaugh
tered defenders of the cause of labor. You
saw the death and heard the groans of the
wounded women and defenseless children. The
blood and brains of worklngmen were spat
tered around where their heads had been laid.
Who directed the soldiers to aim their rifles
and tire bullets at the breasts of the labor
ers?
It was the Emperor, the Grand Dukes, the
Ministers, the generals, the nobles of the court.
They are the murderers. Slay them!
To arms, comrades!
Seize the arsenals and the arms at the
depots and at the gunsmiths'. Day low the
prison walls. Liberate the defenders of free
dom. Demolish the police and gendarmeries
stations and all the Government and state
buildings*.
We must thrown down the Emperor and the
Government and must have our own govern
ment.
Long live the revolution!
Long live the constituent assembly of the
representatives of the people!
A third proclamation appeals to the
people not to attempt to injure pri
vate property.
General Prince Vasilchlkoff, com
mander of the guards, has not yet an
nounced the stringent rules usually
accompanying a state of siege, such
as forbidding persons to leave their
houses after 10 o'clock at night with
out special passes and the extinction
of all lights In private quarters after
that hour. The authorities evidently
are still confident that they have the
situation well in hand.
There is no confirmation of the re
port that the Emperor and Empress
, and their children are going to Co
penhagen, or, on the other hand, that
the Emperor has decided to appoint
! a mixed commission of officials, em
ployers and workingmen to consider
the strikers' demands, notably the
question of eight hours' work per day,
and to make an investigation of the
shooting of the strikers.
PREMATURE REJOICING.
All sorts of rumors are circulating
in both official circles and among the
worklngmen. A curious report spread
among the men last night was that
the Emperor had given in and that
three white flags had been placed
over the Winter Palace, signifying
that he had consented to reduce the
maximum legal hours of work from
eleven to eight. According to this leg
end, the Emperor would have dis
played a red flag if he had decided to
refuse the strikers' request. Many
workingmen. deceived by the rumor,
shouted "Hurrah!" in token of vic
tory and this possibly was the reason
that the strikers, believing they had
already won the day, refrained from
committing excesses yesterday.
Father Gopon's popularity is unim
paired, but it is already evident that
the Social Democrats are getting the
upper hand and that they are encour
aging the people to violence. From a
trustworthy source It is learned that
Father Gopon sent a letter to the. So
cial Democrats in the Following terms:
Tbey have fired upon and massacred us, but
we are not vanquished and the day of our
triumph is nigh. Do not spoil our triumph by
taking up arms and resorting to violence,
foment yourselves with destroying the porÂ«
traits of him who Is no longer worthy to b*
our Kmoeror.
This pacific admonition irritated the
Social Democrats and does not meet
witb, a response from the workingmen,
who apparently are thirsting for
vengeance and are clamoring for their
leaders to distribute the arms.
The revolutionists are reported to be
actively preparing bombs and infernal
machines to wreck the post and tele
graph offices and destroy other Gov
ernment property. They talk wildly
of issuing a manfesto declaring a pro
visional government. They seem to
have broken completely with the
Zemstvoists, whom they treat with
contempt on account of what they call
their "truckling" to autocracy. Even
Prince Truebetskoi, who led the re
formers of Moscow, is regarded by
them with suspicion and even hatred
because in an article published by the
Fravo he described the revolutionists
as a "Port Arthur inside of Russia,"
which Russia would have to over
throw.
AGITATORS UNDER ARREST.
Hessen, editor of the Pravo, whose
advanced liberal views are well known,
has been arrested. The Workingmen's
Club has been closed by order of the
Prefect of Police. Professor Karsaff
and Annensky and Pechsechonoff.
three well-known writers, and Town
Councilors Kedrin and Schnitnikoff,
who are also lawyers, were arrested
during the night.
Traffic between St. Petersburg and
Moscow and St. Petersburg and War
saw is uninterrupted. The Northern
express arrived on schedule time.
During the afternoon came the news
that workmen were going out at Kov
no and Vilna, but particulars were
lacking.
Although the crowds on the Nevsky
Prospect continued to increase, just as
they did yesterday, there were no col
lisions Moreover, during the day
several of the . smaller mills resumed
work, and the men at other mills as
sured their employers that they were
anxious to return, but that the strikers
threatened to kill them if they did so.
The wildest rumors were in circula
tion. A mob was reported to be march
ing on Tsarskoe-Selo to see the Em
peror, as the multitude marched to
Versailles to ask King Louis XVI of
France for bread in 1779; but the story
is utterly without foundation.
In certain quarters, where the woes
of Russia are always laid at the door
of Great Britain, the feeling against

to Put Down the Strike;
ST. PETERSBURG. Jan. 24.âThe ap
pointment of General Trepoff, the
former Chief of Police of Moscow, to
the Governor Generalship of St. Peters
burg was accompanied by an imperial
decree announcing the creation of the
post of Governor General. The incum- j
bent of this office, the decree states, !

ments of administration of the city |
government of St. Petersburg, with;

Of the Minister of the Interior over ap- i

sity for the adoption of measures for
the preservation of state institutions
and public security adapted to the ex
traordinary circumstances of the times.
On this account it was considered nec
essary to create the office of Governor
General of St. Petersburg on the basis !

tions:

"Third, the Governor General has the
right, with the assent of the Minister
of the Interior, to enforce measures
sanctioned by article 140 of the censor-
ship statute.
"Fourth, apart from the right of mak.
ing obligatory the regulations in ac
cordance with law providing for stricter
maintenance of order, the Governor
General will be empowered to make
obligatory the regulations affecting ob
jects of property of any kind in the
interest of public tranquillity and order
in his jurisdiction; while cases of viola
tion of these regulations, the penalties
and method of procedure prescribed in
articles 15 and 16 of the law for the

eral can commission the Governor and
! prefect of St. Petersburg, who are sub
' ject to him, to deal with said cases."

I way purposes as far as police matters

Feeling That Riots Will Hasten End

TOKIO, Jan. 24. âThe Japanese are
keenly watching the developments in
St. Petersburg. -The newspapers pub
lish extras with accounts of the riots,
which are eagerly read. The people
were shocked at the death roll and
there is a widespread feeling that the
bureaucracy will be powerless to stem
the tide of reforms and that the
downfall of the bureaucracy must end
the war. A member of a foreign le
gation said:
"The war is over unless the Rus
sian people are crushed with an iron
heel. It has brought about a crisis.
The Japanese army is now fighting the

NASHVILLE, Term., Jan. 24.âGov
ernor James B. Frazier was to-day
inaugurated as chief executive of Ten*
neesee to serve his second term. In
his inaugural address Governor Fra
zier said in part:
The exigencies of the civil war freed tha
slave, but the black man remained, and with
him a problem unparalleled in its difficulties.
The problems of Industrial regeneration and
racial adjustment were laid upon the man of
the South and they were commanded to solve
them In peace and honor. But our people In
iess than forty years, with little help and
ympathy from any source, have almost solved
the one. and, if let undisturbed, are hopeful
of the other.
On the supreme question which touches our
racial integrity and supremacy let us give alt
mankind to understand that there will ba
neither compromise nor the shadow of turning,
and that the white peoplo of the South must
and will preserve that civilization which has
made them as a race and people strong and
great. Let us with patience bide our time,
and if the issue upon these questions comes,
and I pray God It may not come, then let ua
calmly and with dignity and firmness stand
upon our constitutional rights and demand
that whatever Is meted to us shall be given
in like tenor and effect to all other sections
of our country.

FIGHT OVER YOSEMITE VALLEY STARTS
RECESSIONISTS AND THEIR OPPONENTS LINE
UP AID EXCHANGE ORATORICAL SHOTS.
Senator Belshaw Leads
Party Whose Cry
lls "Recede."
Warm Time Promised
Before the Question
Is Decided.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 24.âWarm
timeÃ are ahead. The fight in the Sen
ate for and against the re-cession of
the Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa
Big Tree Grove has developed into a
political combat with Senator J. B.
Curtln, a Democrat, leader of the anti
re-cession forces. Opposed to him on
the floor are several of the Influential
Republican members of the upper
House, led by Belshaw of Antioch.
â¢ Belshaw'* forces have the unqualified
support of the State administration
and the moral backing of the Federal
Government, a fact made clear by
President Roosevelt in his last message
to Congress, in which he said that
Yosemite should be included in the
great park system of the United States.
The desires of the Federal Govern
ment, however, are not weighing heav
ily in the fight. Sentiment, though it
is still railed at by the opponents of
the bill, has been abandoned and closer
attention is being paid to the prac
tical theory of "Trade," a legislative
scheme that has inflicted more bills
upon the people than all the genius of
oratory. Lined up with Curtin are
Senators Wolfe of San Francisco, Sel
vage of Eureka, Shortridge of San
Jose and Ralston of Melones. There
are others, of course, but these are the
orators of the opposition. And they
Â«,11 have bills before the Senate that
must come before the Assembly, where,
it is said, the majority stands for re
cession.
Frowns that come from those Sena
tors that are known to enjoy the con
fidence of the chief executive of the
State often follow the scoring of a
point by the anti re-cessionists. But
they are hammering ahead just the
same, regardless of consequences to
come and if these consequences do fall
upon them there will be a busy hour
in Sacramento.
"If they try to force us," said one
of the anti re-cessionists to-night, "we
will leave a page in Sacramento's his
tory that will stand out above them
all. The riots of St. Petersburg won't
be a circumstance to the row we'll
kick up."
BELSHAW FAVORS BILL.
Senator Belshaw was the first to
address the Senate on behalf of re
cession. He said in part:
California, doc* not own the valley, and mere
ly holds it as trustee of the national Govern
ment. Hence the question of sentiment that
has been raised here is eliminated.
What has California done for the valley?
In forty years it has expended but little over
$400,000. or $10,000 a year, and the fact stands
to-day that it will take $100,000 to put the
roads In proper condition. A bill is before this
house now which provides for the appropria
tion of $300,000 for the construction of a hotel.
All of these things are needed, but the fact
stands that California at this time is not in
a position to expend these large sums. The
Government Is able and will expend these sums
If the divided Jurisdiction now existing ia wiped
away and the Government is given full title.
We have a park of our own. the Big Basin,
and it needs all the money California can spare
. for park purposes. Let us permit the improve
ment Of the valley. There is but one way: re
cede X to the Government of the United States.
Senator Ralston followed Belshaw,
'speaking against recession. He said
that while the claim had been made

YOU CAN INTEREST HIM.
Any Man Over Fifty.
You can Interest any man over fifty
years of age In anything that will
male him feel better, because while he
may not as yet have any positive or
ganic disease he no longer feels the
buoyancy and vigor of twenty-five nor
the freedom from, aches and pains he
enjoyed in earlier years, and he very
naturally examines with interest any
proposition looking to the improvement
and preservation of his health.
He will notice among other things
that the stomach of fifty is a very dif
ferent one from the stomach he pos
sessed at twenty-five. That greatest
care must be exercised as to what is
eaten and how much of it, and even
wtth the best of care there will be in
creasing digestive weakness with ad
vancing years.
A proposition to perfect or improve
the digestion and assimilation of food
is one which interests not only every
man of fifty, but every man, woman
and child of any age. because the
whole secret of good health, good blood,
strong nerves, Is to have a stomach
which will promptly and thoroughly di
gest wholesome food, because blood,
nerves, brain tissue and every other
constitutent of the body are entirely
the product of digestion, and no medi
cine or "health" food can possibly cre
ate pure blood or restore shaky nerves
when a weak stomach is replenishing
the dally wear and tear of the body
from a mass of fermenting half-digest
ed food.
' No, the stomach itself; wants help
â¢and in no round-about way, either; it
wants direct, unmistakable assistance,
-Such as is given by one or two Stuart's
Dyspepsia Tablets after each meal.
These tablets cure stomach trouble,
(because their use gives the stomach a
; chance to rest and recuperate; one of
jjStuart's Dyspepsia Tablets contains di
gestive elements sufficient to digest
SOOD grains of ordinary food, such as
bread, meat, eggs, etc.
[ The plan of dieting is simply andther
name tor starvation, and the use of
prepared foods and new-fangled break
past foods simply, makes matters
Svorse, as any dyspeptic who has tried
them knows.
IT As Dr. Bennett says, the only reason
I can imagine why Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets are not universally used
iverybody who is troubled in any way'
vith poor digestion is because many

PARK TO REMAIN IN CALIFORNIA'S POSSESSION.
that sentiment should have nothing to
do with the question he held a con
trary opinion. It was sentiment, he
concluded, that had established many
of the greatest institutions of the
State and the nation and when
the hour arrived when sentiment
should no longer prevail it would be
a dark hour for the people.
Senator Charles M. Shortridge had
received a petition signed by many in
fluential societies, institutions and cit
izens of his district asking that he
support the bill for recession. A note
on the bottom of the petition, saying
that it had been procured in an hour,
aroused the Senator's .suspicion, how
ever, and while he indirectly opposed
the measure with all his logic and
oratory he took advantage of the oc
casion to roast without restraint his
constituent that should dare to get
so speedy as to procure a petition in
an hour. In talking against the bill
Shortridge ran the gamut of history
from the day Webster replied to
Hayne on the rights of States and
wound up with a blaze of metaphor
that entwined -in his rhetoric the
golden sands, the golden sun. the
golden poppy and the golden haired
maids of the West, all of which, he
said, cry out against recession and he
stands with them.
Senator Hahn spoke in favor of the
measure, closing the morning session.
WOLFE TAKES FLOOR, .
Wolfe opened the afternoon session,
speaking against the bill. He raised
the point that the Legislature cannot
constitutionally re-cede the valley, for
it was a gift to the State in trust and
the question of re-cession must be sub
mitted to the people at the polls for
decision. He would not for one, he
said, confess that California was too
poor to properly maintain the Yosemite
and hence he was unalterably opposed
to the bill.
Selvage followed Wolfe, presenting
an argument against re-cession, senti
ment not being overlooked by him.
Senator Irish of Downieville followed
in favor of the bill and he placed a
.new construction on the sentiment
question that won the first applause of
the day. In part he said:
As chairman of the committee of which a
majority reported in favor of this bill, I be
lieve 1 should give you the views that caused
us to recommend it for passage. We reached
the conclusion that the Government at Wash
ington, the Government of the- people, for
the people and by the people, Is the
greatest Government on earth, and that all
the blessings we enjoy wa receive either di
rectly or indirectly from tfrat Government. We
believe that the head of this Government is at
Washington, not at Sacramento, and we resent
the imputation that the Government at Wash
ington would take any action that would be
Incompatible with our interaata. We owe alle-
Sience first to the United States of America,
â¢econd to California, and this question of senti
ment finds small favor with us. We know that
if the Yosemite Valley is re-ceded It will not
be taken from Us: that It will still be located
within the confines of our glorious State. But
we feel that the greater wealth of the United
States will permit the quicker developmnt of
the proposed Improvements that every man In
California would like to see Installed in the
valley.
Senator Curtln closed the day's de
bate. He used the same argument
against the re-cession bill he advanced
on the day the question was argued
in committee. He grilled the military
rule of government reservation and
closed his argument with quotations of
law â¢he said would prevent the State
receding the valley. But if they are
set aside without right, he concluded,
title to lands now vested in private
owners in the valley will fall and great
injustice will be done.
At the conclusion of his argument
Coggins m,oved that the discussion of
the bill go over for a week. Belshaw
seconded the motion and -on roll call
It carried. Within the week to come
before the bill is taken up there is
going to be some politics done. The
result will be awaited with Interest.
The bill will come up on special order
on February 2.
After the debate on the bill to re
cede the Yoaenlite to the National Gov
ernment the Senate took up Its regular

Two Physicians Who Are
Members of Upper House
Â»
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 24. âThe Sen
ate and Assembly committees on
Public Health and Quarantine met in
the Senate chamber of the Capitol to
night to discuss Senator Frank Lea
vitt's bill, which repeals the present
compulsory vaccination law of the
State Board of Health. This law
makes vaccination a prerequisite for
admission into the public schools of
the State. The members of the Anti-
Vaccination League were present in
force to present their arguments in
favor of the Leavitt bill. The speak
ers for the league were Dr. W. W.
Allen, president of the Berkeley Board
of Education; Dr. J. U. Oberg of
Berkeley, Mrs. Campbell of Berkeley,
Professor J. Eicher of Oakland, J. S.
Wilson of Berkeley, Cs E. Kinard of
Oakland, Mrs. H. F. Hoffman of
Berkeley, and Wilbur Wulker, secrer
tary of the Merchants' Exchange of
Oakland.
Walker stated that one of his chil
dren died as the result of vaccination,
and Mrs. Hoffman brought one of her
five children into the Senate chamber
to show the effect that vaccination had
produced "on the child's skin. She
said that all her other children who
had been vaccinated in compliance,
with the present law were affected in
the same way.
J. S. Wilson made the principal
speech against the compulsory law.
He presented a great array of statis
tics intended to prove that vaccina
tion was not a preventive of smallpox,
and that it often caused the death of
the persons inoculated.
Senators J. A. McKee of Sacramento
and Chester Roweil of Fresno, both
practicing physicians and both menu
bers of the Public Health and Quar
antine Committee, replied to the anti
vaccinationists and upheld the pres
ent law. They declared that vaccina
tion was harmless and that as a result
of its discovery smallpox was dying
out all over the world.
The committee will hold another
meeting for the further consideration
of the arguments for and against
Senator Leavitt's bill.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 4.âThe Assem
bly got well into the final passage of
bills to-day, and quite a number of
measures, most of them of minor im
portance, ended their career before
that house. Among the bills passed
was the one increasing the salary of
the Justices of the Peace of San Fran
cisco, that exempting certain persons
from jury duty and those relating to
the new Court of Appeals and Its offi
cers. A bill from tile Registrar's office
of San Francisco amending the section
of the election law relating to the
counting of ballots was re-referred to
the Committee on Election Laws, as
what was considered a "bug" of seri
ous proportions was discovered in it.
The importance of the Democratic
minority in the House was established
by one of its members, Jones of Tuo
lumne, and the four Bourbor.s are
wearing enlarged chests in conse
quence. Owing to the early hour of
convening, and the fact that many
members are away on junkets, there
were only forty-three Assemblymen

lng the act relating to persons exempt
from service on juries so it will include

of Fresno. "This bill simply exempts
more people from service as jurors," he
said. "There are too many on the ex

Chandler's opposition did not pre
vent the passage of the bill.
Among the important bills recom
mended passed by committees were
those providing for roads along the
Kings River and from Kern to Los
Angeles County, and that providing for
a commission to act in conjunction
with the Federal Government in inves
tigating the State's water resources
and providing the best methods of pre

o'clock.
The feature of the afternoon session
of the Assembly was the fight over the
final passage of the bill providing that
all graduates of the University of
Southern California should be admit
ted to practice law on their diplomas.
The opposition was led by Coghlan
and the champion of the bill was
Houser. Goodrich, Manwell and Coyle
also spoke for It and Drew against it.
So warm was the opposition that
Houser was compelled to withdraw the
bill for the present, a vote on motion
of Coghlan that It be referred back to
a committee of five to look into the
character and standing of the college
developing fourteen votes, though lost.
"If we grant this privilege," said
Coghian, "at the next session there will
be twenty or thirty more small colleges
asking it. The University of California
is the only one that has had this high
honor conferred on it in this State.
Stanford, which is the equal of any
college In the world, has never been so
honored."
i "The Southern California Law Col-
I lege is as large as that of Dartmouth
ior Williams," said Goodrich, "and has
i professors equal to any in the coun

"My sentiment ang sympathies are

:to its support I know its high

I this honor would be ill advised. The

PERKINS WIELDS
SENATE GAVEL.
. â¢
Serves During Frye's Absence
. i
Suggestion Made That California
Should Grow Pineapples.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24. âSenator
Perkins is presiding officer of the Sen
ate and has been for some weeks.
President Pro Tern. Frye has long been I
in the habit of calling the Californian j
to the chair whenever he himself j
wished to vacate for a time, and so I
when Senator Frye took sick the place |
fell naturally to Senator Perkins. As
the days ran on there came bills to
be signed. Senator Perkins declined
to assume that function. But other
days passed and other bills piled up
ready to go to the President or to the
House, and so the Senate passed a
resolution authorizing Senator Perkins
to sign and make the bills good. So
he has since then been virtually
President of the Senate and as such
has certified to the Presidential re
turns from a number of the States.
And there -are none to say that the
business of the most distinguished leg
islative body in tfte world does not
move as smoothly and correctly under
his guidance as at any time in its his
tory.
Senator Perkins spent the Christ
mas recess in Florida. He had a curi
osity about it as being the only State
in the Union he had not visited. He
found a good many things much as
they are represented on the bills, but
he says "Pshaw!" when you speak of
comparisons with California. The ho
tels and the price per day are big and
fine, but for the rest, "well, Califor
nians don't know what they've got.
"I always feel that way when I
visit places that bear big reputations
along our own lines âfor fruit, nuts,
olives, wines and the like. I've been to
Spalh, Italy, Greece and the islands of
the Mediterranean, but in every case I
go back to California satisfied that
they have little to show us. When 1
say that I, of course, take into account
the difference in age and put some
what into the balance on our side our
great stretch of fertile lands and the
energy and purpose of our people. In
very many things we have distanced
the old countries in the very products
that have made them famous. Still
there are things that we have not
done that we can do and that we will
do. We are moving rapidly and we
have almost unlimited opportunity.
"If Florida had our energy she too
could do much that she has not done.
For modern progress the State is in
debted almost to one man alone. The
negro as a laborer is a lazy and shift
less quantity and nothing very rapid
can be expected where he is greatly
depended upon. But yet Florida has
something to teach us. It is how and
why to grow the pineapple. That is an
easy thing to do, it appears, and they
tell me it yields a value of 5400 per
acre. Why it has not been grown,in
California I do not understand. The
eastern portions of San Diego, River
side and San Bernardino counties are
peculiarly adapted for the crop. The
pineapple is more of an air than an
earth plant. It grows in sand and re
quires very little water. It also re
quires but little attention, which is one
reason, no doubt, that it is so popular
down in Florida. However, that should
not be an objection anywhere."
Senator Perkins says this little ex
cursion was the first bit of recreation
he has taken in many years. During
the twelve years he has represented
California in the upper house he has
been absent from his seat but twice
while the Senate was in session and
then he was sick.

In the matter of drydocks, because
of the failure of contractors in more
places than San Francisco, the Gov
ernment is suffering a handicap. Only
at Brooklyn, of all the navy yards of
the nation, is there a dock of suf
ficient size to admit a battleship. And
because there are several battleships
undergoing repairs and which will have
to be docked for one reason or another,
the demand is much larger than the
supply. It will thus be seen that the
regivlng of the contract at Mare Island
was none too hurried.
In the long stretch of the Pacific
Coast from San Diego to Point Bar
row, there are two navy yards. That
at Mare Island is to be equipped at
once with a drydock capable of re
ceiving the largest battleship and also,
it is hoped and believed by the Cali
fornia delegation, despite the opposition
manifested in the Bureau of Construc
tion, with cranes and tools fitting It for
building as well as repairing. This is
recognised as a necessity. On the At
lantic Coast within the distance repre
sented on the Pacific Coast by Puget
Sound and Mare Island, there are seven
navy yards. These facts plead for
the most liberal treatment at the hands
of Congress for the Pacific Coast and
Its two navy yards.

The growth and popularity of the
Benevolent and Protective Order of
Elks Is said to threaten the existence
of the magnificent animal from which
it gets its name, so far at least as the
State of Washington Is concerned. In

takes place there In the Olympic
forest reserve robs Senator Foster of a
good deal of the Joy of living that
ought to be his. stream of
petitions and protests pours in upon
him complaining that hunters go into
the Olympic Mountains weeks before
the law gives them the right and that
they kill elk In great numbers only to
secure their teeth. Where the antlers
are good they take the head. Such
has been the wholesale killing this
year, it is said, that another such sea
son wl!l see the end of the elk. Sena
tor Foster has sought the aid of the
Secretary of Agriculture and of the
Secretary of the Interior, but both de
clare themesleves helpless. Secretary
Wilson advises the State of Washing
! ton to enforce her game laws, pro
tect male as well as female elk for a
! period of years, prohibit the sale of
teeth and heads and to provide an ef
fective warden system if she would
prevent the extinction of the animal.

Senator Foster of Washington, who
takes a lively Interest in the salmon
fishing industry of the Pacific Coast,
has been informed by Commissioner
Bowers of the Bureau of Fisheries
that artificial propagation is exerting
a very remarkable influence on the
supply of salmon, as is* instanced by
the fact that in 1896 6000 marked
fingerllng salmon were released from
the Clackamas (Oregon) hatchery and
of these during 1898, 1899 and 1900
hundreds were caught by the Wash
ington. Oregon and California fisher
ies. The weight of the recaptured fish
was about 10,000 pounds and their
market value, estimated at 5 cents a
pound, was $500. For every thousand
S. W. WALL
wlmon hatched and planted by the
bureau fishermen are catching 2000
pounds of adult salmon for the mar
ket. As the entire expense of this ,
work to the Government is shown to
be under $1 per thousand fish planted.
Bowers' estimates that salmon culture
Is yielding an enormous profit. If the
average results are but one-tenth those
indicated, he says, the bureau's oper
ations give an actual money return of i
1000 per cent per annum.

"Beneficial use" has come to be a
frequently used term in the talk of the
Reclamation Bureau touching the
question of the diversion of waters for
irrigation purposes. "Beneficial use,"
says the Secretary of the Interior in a
recent report to Congress touching the
Colorado River schemes, "should be
the basis measure and limit" under
which individuals or corporations may
ask or Congress should grant the right
to use waters of navigable streams.
The diversion of water upon land for
the purpose of irrigation is not
enough, it will be seen. The diver
sion must be upon land of a character
which it is known will respond with
profitable crops when so watered.
The inference is that all the land upon
which water, money and effort have
been expended is not of that charac
ter. Some of it is so heavily charged
with alkali that the water will not re
deem it.
In regard to the Colorado River the
report says, with its great fluctuations,
its flood In spring dwindling to a
thread of water in the fall, only by
the comprehensive plans of the
ernment, involving the building of
great and expensive reservoirs, can its
waters be properly conserved and any
considerable area be irrigated whiie
the navigability of the river is still
maintained. With the Government
plans carried out some 2.000,000
acres may be irrigated. It is declared
to be manifestly improper to permit
further appropriations by individuals
and corporations, as such make the
work of the Government more and
more difficult. Appropriations al
ready made, It is said, should be recv
ognized as "limited to the extent that
water has aclhally been diverted and
beneficially used upon land capable
of producing remunerative crops."

The so-called Klamath project is
esteemed by the Reclamation Bureau
as one of the most feasible of all the
reclamation schemes its engineers are
working out. The reason first asv
signed is that it will return more for
the money. But even an engineer
will lean to a picturesque feature In
his business. This scheme will first !
create a desert and then redeem it. It
will throw away an abundance of wa
ter, drain two or three lakes to get at
the tillable soil beneath, which it will
water from another lake higher up.
By draining Tule Lake 100,000 acres
will be uncovered. Lower Klamath
Lake will release 25,000 more. Then
there is a bog area to be drained,
embracing about 80,000 acres. About
120.000 acres of valley land is in
cluded in the scheme. All this is to be
watered by the proper disposition of
the waters of Upper Klamath Lake, a
body of water covering a surface
area of about 70,000 acres. This
scheme necessitates legislative action
on the part of the national Govern
ment and the States of California and
Oregon, the States being required to
waive their tit|e to the beds of the
lakes which are on the boundary. The
Government works will cost about
$4,000,000. The work will be begun
at once following the legislative war.

HEALTH BOARD
CASE ARGUED
Franklin K. Lane Questions
Good Faith in Abolishing
Offices and Making Others
ABE ETJEF REPLIES!
Says That Suit Is Subter-i|
fnge to Get Old Feeders *
Back to the Public Crib J
Franklin K. Lane of the counsel em- j j
ployed by the Merchants' Association 1
and Abe Huef, defending the Board of
Health, divided yesterday before Judge J
Sloss in the closing arguments in the
case of J. E. Quinn, who seeks as a
taxpayer to enjoin the City and Caun- j
ty Auditor and Treasurer from audit- j
ing and paying the salaries of the dep- j
uty health officer and inspecting physi
cians, whose appointments were made
coincidental with the creation of their
offices last January. .
Mr. Lane's 'argument went to the j
question of the good faith of the Board :
of Health in abolishing old offices and
creating new ones, thus disposing of :
old employes and making placed for
new public- servants. The attorney
contended that the power to abolish
an office was not arbitrary, but was
limited by the charter to the classifica
tion of the civil service. The very pur
pose of the charter, he said, was to
take these appointments out of pol
itics ami fill the positions by merit
alone. meaning of the charter was
that a man appointed on merit and fit
ness should remain in office until good
cause was shown for his dismissal.
Such appointees are protected by the
law.
Said Mr. Lane: "We can come m
as taxpayers, and protect the public
treasury from the consequences of il
legal acts done in furtherance of
schemes "to do politics' and make ap- '
pointments for expediency when the
political wheel turns." He read an
article., on the beneficent effects of the
civil service law and discussed the
evils of the "spoils system" by which
political workers are rewarded by ap
pointment for the work done and the
work they are able to do. It results,
he said, in inefficiency, extravagance
and the corruption of the elective
franchise.
Mr. Lane thought that the history
of the acts of the Board of Health, In
abolishing one office and creating a
new one, in disregarding the spirit of
the civil service rules, and In other
acts cited, had proved a strong case
of bad faith. Upon the plea of the
other side that the action of the Civil
Service Commission in approving the
new classifications of the Board of
Health had stopped the court from act- !
lng, Mr. Lane declared that the il
legal action of any board could not
prevent a taxpayer from appealing to
the Superior Court. The Civil Service
Commission had not gone Into the
question of duties, efficiency or good
faith in creating new offices, but had
merely assumed that the Board of
Health had the power to make a new
classification. If this rule should be
held good, said the attorney, the whole
scheme of the civil service must fall.
The change had been made in bad
faith and in avoidance of the letter and
spirit of the charter.
At the afternoon session Abe Ruef
answered Mr. Lane's argument. He
charged that Quinn was acting in bad
faith as a taxpayer to prevent the
payment of $1800 in salaries for work
which had formerly cost the Board of
Health $8100. He declared that Louis
Levy was doing the work of five men
for $150 a month, where $600 had been
paid before. He cited instances of the
Health Board's action to prove good
faith in following the rules of the Civil
Service Commission and in reviewing
the testimony of members of the board
who had acquiesced in the changes,
without having given personal atten
tion to the object, he said that faith
and confidence was placed in the judg
ment of Dr. Ward, the president, who
had an opportunity to determine the
necessities from former experience.
Referring to Quinn's suit, Ruef said:
"The action is a subterfuge to put
back to the public crib men who were
feeding there before this political wheel
turned which made one man do the
work of five; he Is merely asking your
honor to corrupt the administration to
put in $8100 of expenses where $1800
now exists." He said" that the suit
was based upon a hollow mockery, if
not fraud, and was intended to emas
culate the civil service: that if the
contention of the plaintiff should hold,
whole pages of the charter relating to
civil service would be wiped out. If
Levy's position were untenable, every
janitor, street sweeper and laborer in
th city's employ would have his job
illegally, not having undergone a civil
service examination.
The Board of Health, said Mr. Ruef.
had a right to abolish a position in the
interest of retrenchment: had the right
to create a new place and to employ
any one for the efficient carrying out

MORE EVIDENCE
AGAINST HOCH
Relatives of Six of Man's
Wives Believe the Women
Were Killed With Poison
CHICAGO, Jan. 24.âInformation of
more alleged victims of the supposed
Bluebeard, Johann Hoch, has been
given the police by John Frick, an em
! ploye of the Nickel Plate Railroad.
1 Frick has reported to the police that
his sister, Mrs. William Schultz, mar
ried Hoch, who then called himself Al
bert Muschburg, at Argos, lnd., in 1900.
Mrs. S< hultz had a child named Net
tie, then 5 years of age.
'Shortly after they arrived in Chi
cago letters ceased coming to me, '
said Frick. 'and I am under the belief
that my sister and her little girl were
done away with. My sister had about
$1500 at the time of her marriage."
Mrs. H. J. Schwartzman of Mil
waukee telegraphed to the police that
she was on her way here for the pur
pose of trying to Identify a photograph
of Hoch as the man who married her
sister in IS9S. The woman died short
ly after, leaving $1800 to her husband.
Relatives of tix of the thirteen wives
credited to Hoch have expressed a be
lief to Police Inspector Shippy that the
six women died from poison. The list
of dead and missing is as follows:
Mrs. Marie Welker Hoch, died Janu
ary 11, 1905.
Mrs. Mary Steinbecker, died 1894.
Mrs. Mary Becker, St. Louis, died
1902.
Mrs. Mary Schulta, died 1900.
<.'hild also disappeared.
Mrs. Lena Hoch, Milwaukee.
Mrs. Sophia Hoch. Milwaukee.
Acting on the theory that Hoch is
the missing janitor of the notorious H.
H. Holmes' "Castle," the police are
using the same methods to trace Hoch
as were used in seeking Holmes. The
officers believe Hoch to be a pupil of
Holmes and that he will use the same
ruses that were employed by Holmes
to escape arrest.

WAS JUSTIFIED
Witness Tells Jury He Be
lieves L. D. Campbell Did
Eight When He Shot Wife
WANTS PRISONER FREED
He Says Woman a Flirt
and Persisted in Keeping
Man in Much Suspense
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 24.
Testimony in favor of Lemuel D.
Campbell, charged with the murder of
his wife, was introduced at the trial j
of the case to-day. It is the en-1
deavor of the defense to show that (
mental worry over his wife's actions j
caused him anguish. Three witnesses
were put on the stand to tell the state
Â©f mind of Campbell months before
the tragedy occurred. To all of them
he talked and expressed the wish that
ahe would leave him alone.
Although divorced, she,called him 1
up daily over the telephone and upon
one occasion she threatened him with
a knife.
In regard to this affair A. W. An- ,
â¢elnii, a butcher, for whom Campbell, ,
wcrked, said:
Mrs. Campbell either came around to the
â¢hop or called him up nearly every day. I
went to the shop one day and they were In the .
back room and she had a pistol and pointed
it at Campbell. I told her to get out and
took the pistol away from her and 'put it
Into a drawer. As she went out she took up
a knife and made a stab at Campbell and cut
hia apron. I then put her out of the shop.
In less than a week sbe was around again.
I saw her with a man on one occasion and told
Campbell and he cried.
On cross-examination the witness
â¢aid that he and Campbell had been
friends for a long time, and he added:
"I want to see justice done him, and
I believe he was justified in doing
what he did."
J. F. Swart, a druggist, who acted
as physician for Campbell, gave testi
mony in his favor, and Dan McCarthy,
a saloon man at the Sixteenth-street
station, testified that Campbell often
cried over the misdeeds of his wife and
also told him that if she ever rang
him up to tell her that he was not
there.

ON WEDDING ANNIVERSARY
Mrs. Christian Werren Disappears
AGED INNKEEPER OF NORTH BERKELEY WHOSE WIFE HAS DIS
APPEARED. RUMOR BEING THAT SHE HAS ELOPED WITH FRED
TROSCH A MAN THIRTY YEARS HER JUNIOR.
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, Jan. 24.
"Gone with a handsomer man" is,
In effect, the message that Christian
Werren has received from his wife, a
woman of sixty years of age, who has
eloped, he says, with Fred Trosch,
thirty years her junior.
Mrs. Werren and Trosch have been
missing since last Saturday. He was
a boarder in the Werren home in the
hills of North Berkeley. The woman
drew her husband's savings from the
Union Savings Bank of Oakland on
Saturday, smuggled her clothing from
the house and left Werren to mourn the
loss of a wife and the savings of a
lifetime.
On the very day that Mrs. Werren
disappeared there was to have been
a wedding anniversary celebration in
the Wernen home. Thirty-five years
ago trie Werrens were married. Last
Saturday. friends of the family had
been bidden to a feast and a generally
good''time in the Werren household.
The>" guests gathered, prepared to
congratulate Mr. and Mrs. Werren, but
there was no hostess / fo receive them.
Instead, Mr. Werren-; bewildered and
in agony of mind, informed all who
came that his wife had disappeared
and he feared that she had not gone
away alone.
Th* would-be merry-makers left and
Werf en ' remained alone all of Satur
day night. The next day he ascer
tained that Mrs. Werren had drawn
from the bank the joint savings of the
couple, that her clothing had been re
moved from the home and that she
had been seen at the saloon of J.
Carnelohg on San Pablo avenue with
Trosch on Saturday morning. He then
was convinced that his wife had eloped.
The, Werrens. conducted a hotel and
drinking place in North Berkeley, on
the road to Contra Costa County. They
were regarded as picturesque old per-
Bo i ns.- J Each was a Swiss* he 66 and she
60? years old. Their resort, .was a, favor
ite ground for merry-making by the
university students, who knew the
well.
â¢ Trosch was a lodger in the Werren
home. The old Swiss proprietor was
tealous and suspicious of his attentions
fo Mrs. Werren- and last Tuesday
Trosch left the place. The elopement
is supposed to have followed.
J. Camelong, the San Pablo avenue,
saloon-keeper referred to by Werren,
says that he saw Mrs. Werren and
Trosch together Saturday morning.
The Werrens were old friends and pa
trons of his. He states that he was
informed by a friend that Mrs. Werren
was seen at the Sixteenth street station
in Oakland Saturday evening, prepar
ing to board a train.
Mrs. Werren was a participant in a
sensational shooting affair at the resort
last spring, in March A masked high
wayman demanded that she deliver up
the money in the till. She refused and
was shot through the breast It was
thought that she could not live, but
her vitality was such that she event
ually recovered and Is now perfectly
. well, while her aged husband, who
nursed her back to life and strength,
'is feeble and bent, with years.

GIRL REFUSES
MEDICAL HELP
'Peculiar Death of Miss
j Vekdnder to Be Subject
of Coroner's Investigation
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, Jan. 24.
Because of the unusual circum
| stances in connection with the death
jof Miss Flora Ann Vekander, a young
j woman who died this morning in her
; room in the Thomas block on Center
; street, the Coroner has ordered an ln
! quest held next Thursday morning.
Miss Vekander was a Christian
| Science devotee. She refused the aid
lof all save believers in that cult when
I disease attacked her two weeks ago.
She was threatened with pneumonia,
; but received no treatment or attention
\ other than that provided by Professor
jE. H. Twight of the agricultural
; department of the State University,
who is a Christian Science believer,
j and his wife. The Twights reside in
! the same building with Miss Vekander.
Miss Vekander's brother, a viticul
tural expert, who graduated from the
\ State University and is now employed
as an expert at Sacramento, was sent
J for last Thursday. He states that his
1 sister was of an extraordinarily firm
temperament, secretive and independ
ent, so that his entreaties to have her
. provided with regular medical attend
, ante were unavailing. She had made
; out a document directing preparations
' for the disposition of her body In event
of death before he came.
The exact nature of the young
.woman's ailment will be determined at
the inquest, though it is believed to
have been pulmonary disorder that
-ended her life.

MAKE A FIGHT
OVER MATERIAL
Rival Contractors at War
Over the Relative Merits of
Concrete and Brick Work
SCHOOL BOARD DELAYS
Directors Postpone Action
on Bids Until They Can
. Decide Regarding Matter
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway. Jan. 24.
There is a battle on between the
contractors of Oakland for the privi
lege of building the foundations to
the new public school buildings short
ly to be erected in Oakland. The con
test wages between the cement men
and the brick handlers. Each side
has made a strong fight, the re
sult being that the Board of Educa
tion has been called upon to decide
whether a concrete or a brick founda
tion is best.
The situation unfolded itself last
night before the board when bids were
opened for the buiiding of the foun
dation of the new Franklin School.
Bids for both brick and concrete were
called for, the result being that, to the
surprise of the board and its archi
tects, the brick men came In with
some low figures. The architects had
believed the brick bids would be much
higher than the concrete. More than
that, there was a wide range of dif
ference in the brick bids that gave
rise to considerable comment.
Childs & Arlett, at $3600, were
lowest on brick, and D. E. Brown's
bid of $4450 was the lowest for con
crete. The highest brick bid was
that of McPhee & Co., $5982.
The board wrestled* with the prob
lem and after much discussion de
ferred action for two weeks. Mean
while the board will try to get expert
information on the subject of con
struction materials.

The dancing set Is looking forward with
pleasure to th# Country Club cotillon, which
takes place to-morrow night. Considerable in
terest has been manifested in this dance and
as the programme will include the old-fash
ioned quadrilles and a german or two, there
will probably be some genuine fun. When the
young people of to-day, who are two-stepping
through life, eliminated the quadrilles and
lancers from their social menu, they cut out
a lot of real enjoyment that only the old
timers know anything about.

HEART DISEASE
CAUSES DEATH
Autopsy Proves Miss McKee
Did Not Take Her Life as
It Was at First Supposed
BODY IS COMING HOME
Sister of Young Woman Says
That She Had Been 111 and
Under Medical Attention
ALAMEDA, Jan. 24.âAccording to a
telegram received here to-day by rela
tives of Miss Mary C. McKee, who died
on a westbound overland train, and
whose body was taken from the train
at Albuquerque, N. Mex., yesterday,
the young woman's demise was due to
heart disease. It was at first thought
when Miss McKee was found dead in
her berth in a sleeping car that she
had taken her own life, but an au
topsy has shown that she passed away
from a natural cause.
Mrs. L. B. Chase, a sister of Miss
McKee, says the latter >ad been in
poor health for some time, and that
on her way home from New York she
was forced to stop at Chicago for med
ical treatment. Miss McKee's body is
now on the way to Alameda and is due
to arrive here Thursday. Arrange
ments for the funeral have not yet
been made. Surviving Miss McKee are

MORPHINE MAY HAVE CAUSED
THE DEATH OF MISS McKEE
Possible That She Accidentally Took
an Overdose to Alle

ALBUQUERQUE, N. M., Jan. 24.â
The undertakers who embalmed the
btdy of Miss Mary K. McKee, who was
found dead in a Pullman berth on a
Santa Fe train on Sunday night, be
lieve that her death was not due to
natural causes and intimate that mor
phine was used. There was no inquest
here as the death occurred outside the
county.
An undertaker in Alameda, Cal.. tel
egraphed last night as#lng that the
body be forwarded. It was accordingly
s?nt to Mrs. L. B. Chase of Alameda
tc-night. It is possible that Miss Mc-
Kee took an overdose of morphine to
aileviate some pain and with no
thought of suicide.
DUKE'S BRIDE
IN THE TOMBS
Â«
Arrested in New York on a
Texas Indictment and for
Want of Bail Put in Cell
NEW YORK, Jan. 24.âMrs. Alice
Webb-Duke, wife of Brodie L. Duke,
was arrested at an office in Broad
street in this city to-day on requisition
papers issued by the Texas authorities.
Mrs. Duke had been indicted by the
Grand Jury at Nacogdoches, Texas, on
the charge that she and Charles L.
Taylor, of Chicago, ' made false state
ments in an instrument, on the strength
of which a stockholder in one of the
national banks in that place was in
duced to Indorse their notes for $20,000.
Mrs. Duke was arrested as she was
alighting from a cab to enter an office
in Broad street. When Mrs. Duke was
notified that she was under arrest she
became hysterical and screamed and
wept. She declared: "I'm the wife of
Brodie L. Duke. His family are trying
to hurt me. I have done nothing
wrong." She insisted upon making a
call In the building as she had intended,
but the detective would not permit it
and took her to the District Attorney's
office in a cab. She sat weeping in that
office until her counsel arrived.
When Mrs. Duke was, arraigned in
the Police Court she was held in $3000
bail. This her counsel was unable to
secure and was taken to a
cell in the Tombs Prison. She appeared
to be very much distressed during her
brief stay in the courtroom and several
times seemed to be about to faint.
The proceedings which resulted in
Mrs. Duke's arrest are entirely distinct
from her matrimonial difficulties.

ALARM OF FIRE
STIRS PUPILS
One Thousand Youngsters
Calmly March Through
Smoke at Lincoln School
DRILL PROVES SUCCESS
Not a Child Hurt in Empty
ing the Building, Show
ing Benefit of Drilling
Â»
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Jan. 24.
One thousand pupils of the Lincoln
School at Tenth and Alice streets, en
dangered by fire that broke out in the
big frame building, marched out of the
structure this morning under perfect
control of their teachers, in response
to the school alarm of fire that re
sounded through the edifice at 11:30
o'clock. The building was emptied In
less than two minutes. Not a child
was hurt and the splendid efficacy of
the "fire drill" in time of actual trou
ble was proven.
Though class rooms and hallways in
the rambling schodlhouse were sud
denly filled with smpke and the crack
ling of flames added to the terror of
the situation, order was maintained
while the children marched in steady
ranks, quickly but quietly, to street
and yard with the discipline of trained
soldiers. firemen arrived
responsive to an alarm sounded by Dr.
Henry M. Fine, who discovered the'
fire from the outside, the building wafl
cleared of every occupant.
The fire started from a defective flue
connecting with stoves in the primary
class rooms of Miss Rosa Kottlnger
and Miss Mary Jewett. There was a
sudden burst of smoke and flame
through the walls that for an instant
caused a commotion among the chil
dren. With precision the teaohers
gave.the command that started their
wards out of the rooms, while hurried
word was sent to Principal J. P. Gar
lick. He sounded the school alarm of
fire that warned every teacher In the
building. In a few seconds the pupils
were in line tramping steadily out ac
cording to the rules laid down in the
"fire drill" regulations. At exits and
on platforms and in hallways the
teachers itood at their posts, directing
the rapid outpouring of children.
The firemen speedily attacked the
fire which burned Its way through the
walls into the roof of the primary de
partment building, which is on the
Eleventh street side of the school lot.
The flames were quenched after walls
and ceilings had been cut away. It
was found that the flue had broken be
tween the two class rooms, the stove
in each room connecting at the top
with the chimney outside.
The primary building is separate
from the main structure, but is con
nected by hallways through which
smoke poured Into the larger part of
the school. At the time of the out
break, Principal Garlick was In the
basement attending to classes there.
He was warned by the cry of Are and
Speedily sent in the school alarm be
fore danger from possible panic had
been aroused. So quickly was the dif
ficulty handled that many pupils in
rooms remote from the scene of the
fire knew of its existence only when
they saw the Fire Department appara
tus- arrive.
Superintendent of Schools J. W. Mc-
Clymonds was summoned to the school
at once. He made a careful Investiga
tion of the cause of the fire and he
handling of the pupils. Commenting
on the episode. Superintendent Mc-
Clymonds said:
This experience demonstrates, first, the ex
cellent discipline under which the thousand
children were marched' out so rapidly and
under such good control to a place of safety.
The feature of the fire drill Is the absence of
any warning whatever as to the time of sound
ing the alarm. The children never know
whether the alarm Is a genuine one or a mere
drill call. For that reason they are never
frightened when the bella sound. Much credit
is reflected upon Principal Garllck and his
corps of teachers for their excellent work this
morning. We are all glad that the Are re
sulted no more seriously than It did.
This experience demonstrates the importance
of fireproof materials in oQr school buildings.
I am glad that the new ones will be built as
far as possible of brick and stone. There
cannot be too many safeguards against Are in
a school building. That of course goes with
out saying.
Principal Garllck also gave much
praise to his teachers for their serv
ices In the emergency.

SANTA CRUZ BANKER LOST
MONEY IN ROULETTE GAME
Hotel Man Paid Losses and Check
Drawn by Loser Is Protested.
Suit on Trial.
A Santa Cruz banker, who played
at a roulette game and lost $1200, and
a prominent hotel-keeper of the same
city, who drew a check for the loss
and took the banker's check in return,
only to have it protested, were the
parties to an interesting case heard
and taken under advisement by Judge
Seawell yesterday.
J. C. C. Leonard, proprietor of the
St. George Hotel at Santa Cruz, sued
H. S. Demfng for $1300. Deming an
swered that Leonard had sublet a
room In his hotel to J. P. Peakes and
the Vein a gambling game was con
ducted. Deming played roulette, first
borrowing $100 from Leonard and
then giving checks for his successive
losses, which aggregated $1200. After
the game Deming was anxious that the
bank should not know of his unfor
tunate dalliance with fortune and hp
had Leonard draw a check'for $1200
for the gamblers, giving his own check
to Leonard for $1300 to cover the loan
and the losses. Demins/s check was
drawn on the Donohoe-Kelly Bank In
San Francisco and was assigned to J.
S. Harlan, one of the gambling firm,
who left for this city on the first train
In the morning following the trans
action of July 10, 1903, to get the
paper cashed, but he was met with a
refusal. Deming said that he had
frequently offered to pay the $100 bor
rowed from the hotel-keeper, but
would not stand for the other loss. He
testified to these facts yesterday and
Leonard was also on the stand. He
admitted that he had let quarters to
the gamblers, but deniea that he was
interested in the profits of their game.
COLUMBUS BANK ELECTS
TWO NEW DIRECTORS
Resignations of Gianninl and Cavag
naro Are Accepted and Suoces
sors Are Promptly Named.
Changes were made in the board of
directors of the Columbus Savings
Bank yesterday. A. P. Gianninl and
Joseph F. Cavagnaro resigned. C.
Sirocco of Sutter Creek. Amador
County, and Dr. C. Barsottl of this
city were elected directors to succeed
them. This second change In the
board In a short time made some talk
in the Italian colony. The explana
tion given by members of the majority
of the board is simple, being that Gi
annini and Cavagnaro are paid em
ployes of the Bank of Italy and that
the Bank of Italy gave them the
choice to remain with but one of the
Italian banks of the city. They chose
to remain with the Bank of Italy. It
was reported yesterday that A. Chi
chizola would resign from the director- â¢
ate of the Columbus Bank, but he did
not. The explanation given by Attor
ney Cavagnaro of his and Giannini's
resignations is that they found them
selves in the minority and concluded
that it would be better to withdraw
from the Columbus Bank.

The lake-like condition of the

result was that the following Sign was

$25 reward for arrest and conviction of any

A great crowd gathered around the
pond and the ducks, but the admoni

*
â¢ Special Dispatch to The Call.
â¢COLUSA, Jan. 24.âFrom all points
.on. the Sacramento River come re- \
â¢ports of broken levees and of great \
' damage by the floods, which have been
increasing in fury since early Mopday '
.morning. At Colusa the river reached
the highest mark ever recorded at 8
o'clock this morning when the gauge
registered twenty-eight feet two and
.one-tenth inches, one inch higher than
point reached last March when ranches
. from Sacramento to Redding were in- j
â¢ undated.
'. It is estimated that there are at least
fifteen breaks on the east side of the .
river above Colusa and in some places
â¢the waters are pouring in torrents over j
the tops of the levees, something that ,
. has never occurred before. Several
thousand acres of land on that side are
under water. There has been no loss
of life or of stock so far. The Govern
ment contractors who have been put- '
ting in a large weir across Butte
SJough, five miles below Colusa, are
having a hard time trying to prevent
the current caused by the weir from
washing out the great levee protecting
district seventy, the breaking of which
will cause the loss of several thousand
acres of the finest grain land in
Western Sutter County. Those in
charge have little hopes of holding out
against the storm.
On the west side things are al
most as bad. There is one break on the
Davis place twelve miles north of Co
lusa that is more than one hundred feet
.wide and through which there Is al
most a river flowing. From this break
' the entire lands of district 108 in South
ern Colusa County and in Yolo County
â will be flooded. This district contains
â¢thirty thousand acres of land that has
been reclaimed and the loss there will
be enormous. There are several other
weak places on the west side to-night
â¢ that are causing much uneasiness, but
as there are a number of experienced
men doing patrol s duty serious results
.are not generally looked for.
The rainfall here to-day has been half
an inch and from the upper Sacramento
River comes the report late to-night
Ihat the rainfall had been one and a
half inches, that the river which began
to recede this afternoon was again ris
ing rapidly and that conditions were
â¢very alarming.

Yesterday's storm extended from
the-Tehachapi to British Columbia.
â¢ 1 he heaviest rainfall was in the l#ac
â¢. hi men to River Valley and last night
i* was feared that the State might ex
perience another flood season. At Red
â¢ Biuff the river measured twenty feet
and at Colusa 28.2, which is the record
for that point.
The wind was strong off shore but
light In the interior of the State.. In
Sati Francisco the precipitation was
nearly three-quarters of an Inch,
which brings the seasonal rainfall up
rÂ«> 14.10 inches. Last year at this time
the rainfall was only a trifle more than
p< \en inches. Professor McAdie pre

SOMETHING VERY DARK
CAME FROM COVER.
TENDER BROILER WAS VICTIM
Now His Blackness Must Be Very
Good for Next Ten Days.
It was not the intrinsic value of the
chickens stolen so much as the Incon
venience created by the unheralded de
pletions of the coop that angered Land
lord Henry Blanken. Nocturnal visi
tors to his wayside inn on the San
Bruno road were much given to order
ing warm birds and cold bottles, and
It was humiliating to him frequently
to find his hennery vacant after he had
whetted the appetites of his guests by
extolling the plumpness and tenderness
of his pullets. The popularity of his
establishment was not enhanced by giv
ing its patrons the alternative of eat
ing ham and eggs or going supperless.
So it was in genuine wrath that he in-
structed his trusty henchman. "Billy"
Dempsey, to sleep lightly, with fire
arms within easy reach, and to pepper
witli buckshot ihe nether limbs of any
person, regardless of color or social
status, whom he might detect in the
act of pilfering the feathered property.
,"Shoot low and shoot straight. Bill,"
was Mr. Blanken's final command, "and
keep on a-shootin' till somethin' drops."
Mr. Dempsey's acceptance of the
trust was cheerful. Placing a loaded
shooting-iron where he could instantly
lay his hand upon it in the dark, he
inaugurated a policy of wakefulness
that was debilitating, but he bravely
stuck to it until night before last his
patience was rewarded by the capture
of a chicken-lifter with the goods in
his possession. Wonted sounds were
suddenly overshadowed by a clucking
and fluttering that emanated from the
henhouse, and Mr. Dempsey leaped
from his cot, grasped his weapon and
intrepidly hastened to the scene of
commotion. As he ran he stumbled
over a sawhorse or a wheelbarrow or
something, and when he had disen
tangled himself from its legs or shafts
or whatever they were the clucking
and fluttering had ceased and all that
assailed his ears was a gentle rustling
amid a bunch of bushes near by. Level
ing his gun at the foliage. Mr. Dempsey
shouted in stern tone, "Come out a
there an' come quick!" To his intense
gratification there came the response,
"Please, don't shootâl'm a-camin',"
and from the brush there emerged a
man with a broiler suspended by one
of its legs from one of his hands.
"Drop the bird an' throw uo yer
mitts!" yelled Mr. Dempsey, and the
mandate was obeyed with a prompti
tude that made the rest of his task a
sinecure.
The chicken-thief was registered as
Michael Boltes and the police desig
nated him a hobo. Judge Fritz scoffed
at his plea that he happened to catch
the chicken as it was escaping from
Mr. Blanken's yard and was conveying
it back to where it properly belonged
when Mr. Dempsey's gunplay thwarted
his purpose. Now he is serving a ten
days' sentence.

"As we haven't a whipping-post for
the disciplining of such fellows as
you," said Judge Mogan to* John
Harvey Robinson, insulter of unpro
tected women, "I will instruct the
Sheriff to see to it that your
six months' imprisonment involves
daily toil on the rockpile. Unfortu*
nately the law restricts me to limiting
your term to six months, for it would
afford me infinite satisfaction to send
you to the penitentiary for ten years."
"1 have letters to prove that I'm a
gentleman," muttered Robinson.
All the letters ever written or that
could be written would not make you
a gentleman," rejoined his Honor.
"You're a low-minded, cowardly fel
low, else you would not make a prac
tice of thrusting your attentions upon
women and girls to whom they are ob*
noxious."
Robinson was arrested at 8:30
o'clock Monday evening on complaint
of a respectable matron and her young
daughter, whom he had followed
along Bush street until they sought
refuge in the Hotel Sevenoaks, when
he stood at the door and hurled foul
epithets after them. Patrolman
Lanckman proved that the fellow was
arrested several months ago for
suiting women in Golden Gate Hall.

Andrew, Wideler, convicted on two

Victor McLaren celebrated his
twenty-first birthday by absorbing in
toxicants until he was crazed. and
while in that condition he invaded the
dry goods store at 1010 Dupont street
and played sad havoc with the stock
in-trade. When the arresting police
man arrived at the scene of dis
order he found young Mr. Mc-
Laren freighting the air with
hoopskirts and shirtwaists and
bustles and other articles of femi
nine apparel, while the affrighted at
taches of the establishment cowered in
concealment. It was his first drunk,
he explained to Judge Mogan. and it

Louis Piper (colored) denied that he
was one of the two men who throttled
and robbed of $700 an Italian farmer
in a Barbarv Coast hotel, but Judge
Conlan sent him to answer in the Su
perior Court. His attempt to prove an
alibi by averring that at the time of
the robbery he was engaged In the rare
occupation of taking a bath was off
set by the complaining witness posi
tively identifying him as one of the
thugs.
"Was it not on some other day that
you took that bath?" his Honor in
quired.
"No. sah." was the prompt reply:
"Ah doan take a bath so often dat
Ah'm likely to fo'git de day Ah takes
it."

"He can have his old clock and his
old statooettes and his old rugs by
sending for em at any time," said
Mrs. Violet Stevens, accused &f trying
to avoid payment for the articles men
tioned after she had obtained posses
sion of them on the installment plan
from A. Lake of 2b Sixth street.
Surmounting the blonde coiffure of
Mrs. Stevens was a hat of immense
circumference and fairly swathed in
'bird-of-paradise feathers. The fluffy
plumage lav in masses atop of crown
and brim and drooped In straggling
extravagance over the edges, some of
the pendants mingling with the long
fur of the white boa that loosely en
circled her neck and descended to her
feet. Her tight-fitting gown was a
dream of light gray.
"Why don't he send for 'em if he
wants 'em?" she asked, beaming
blandly at Judge Mogan.
"But I don't want 'em after you have
used em 'so long," protested Mr. Lake,
of unmistakably nervous temperament.
"I want the money for 'em, that's what
I want."
"Then, why don't you come and col
lect it?" inquired Mrs. Stevens, with
augmented blandness.
Mr. Lake's choler choked his utter
ance as he tried to inform the court
that Mrs. Stevens' elusiveness had
thwarted all his efforts to collect. He
delivered the goods to her at 511
Golden Gate avenue, and when he
went there to collect his first install
ment she had flown, and not until two
months later did he discover her in a
Market-street apartment house. The
clock, the two "statuettes and the two
floor rugs had been in active service
throughout the interim, and if he were
to take them in lieu of the money due
him he would be* a heavy loser.
Couldn't she be compelled to pay the
remainder of the Installments In a
lump? â¢
The court opined that she could not,
and Mrs. Stevens audibly wondered if
she were expected to run all over town
looking for collectors to pay money
to, when she had other matters to en
gage her time. What were collectors
for, if not to find debtors and collect,
she would like to know. Too bad that
Bhe didnf go a-sloshin' through the
rain and mud to find Mr. Lake and
save him the trouble of going to find
her. He knew where she was to be
found, didn't he?
It looked like apoplexy for Mr. Lake
as he asked what was the use of him
going to collect from her when she de
clined to be collected from.
"Well, then, why don't you take back
your old things?" she sweetly inquired.
All that prevented Mr. Lake tearing
his hair was the Judge's command to
Mrs. Stevens that she produce the
"things" in court to-day, so that the
alleged evidence of wear and tear may
be taken into consideration with the
framing of a decision.

â¢ |
JURIST IS SUMMONED
I
Sergeant at Arms Leaves to
Bring Him Before the
Bar of the High Tribunal
â¢
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.âThe Sen
ate to-day took an important step in
the impeachment trial of United States
Judge Charles Swayne of the northern
district of Florida. The organization
for the trial was effected by the swear
ing of the Senators for that purpose;
the managers of the House were re
ceived for the purpose of formally pre
senting the articles of impeachment
and 'a resolution summoning Judge
Swayne to appear was adopted. Piatt
of Connecticut was elected to preside
at the trial sessions. Further proceed
ings were postponed until Friday next,
when Judge Swayne is expacted to ap- ''
pear before the bar of the Senate.
The ceremony was Impressive and
was witnessed by a full Senate and
by well-filled galleries. #
Estimates as to tho length of time
that the trial will occupy vary from
ten days to a month after it is once
begun. It is believed that when Judge
Swayne appears next Friday he will
ask for a few days in which to pre
pare his answer and when he does an
swer a day or two more will be given
to the House'for the presentation of its
replication. A number of witnesses
will be heard and considerable time will
be consumed by attorneys. A part of
each day will be given to the trial.
Judge Swayne is now in Wilmington. 1
Del., and Sergeant at Arms Ramsdeli
of the Senate left for that city to-night
to serve the Senate's summons upon
him.
At the instance of Piatt- of'Connecti- :
cut a roll call of the Senate was or
dered a few minutes before 2 o'clock
in order to insure a full attendance at
the time of the administration of the
oath.
Seventy-two Senators responded to ;
their names and the last name in the
list had scarcely been announced when
< hief Justice Fuller appeared at the
south of the Senate chamber. He was
flanked on the one side by Fairbanks
and on the other by Bacon. He was
ciad in the full robes of his office.
The entire rtenate had risen when the
(.'hief Justice was announced and re
mained standing until he was seated
on the left of President Pro Tern. Frye.
H<; proceeded immediately to admin
ister the oath to the president pro tern. >
and then to Piatt as the presiding oftl
cer for the trial. After they had been
sworn the roll was called and Senators
appeared in groups of ten before the
Senate bar to take the oath, which was
administered by the chief Justice.
OPPOSES SUGAR BILL.
Palmer Argues Against Ijctting .Bars
Down lo Philippines.
! WASHINGTON. Jan. a
; hearing before the Committff on
I Ways and Means to-day Secretary j
Palmer of the American Beet Sugar i
! Association opposed the pending bill \
reducing the duty bn sugar and tobac- |
co from the Philippine Islands.
Palmer said thht just prior to the
tariff agitation regarding Cuban sugar
|in 1901 eighty-six factories had been :
projected in this country. Not one of j
these was built. Since that time Eu- !
j rope had curtailed her sugar crop mi- !
j der the terms of the Brussels agree- j
j ment and the price had gone up to j
I the point where American capital was
|on the point of again enlarging the
j sugar Industry in this country. Now
to open the Philippine market in eom
i petition with the American beet su
i gar industry would again discoufage
> this movement.
I In replying to a question by Curtis,
i whose bill was under consideration.
I Palmer said that the total sugar prod
| uct of the Philippines was 145,000
', tons annually and If the United States
i took it all there would still have to
Ibe imported annually 1,500,000 tons
i to supply the demand.

SCHOOL TEACHERS UNDERPAID.
Thus Declhres Champ Clark in Behalf

again occupied the attention of the
House of Representatives to-day. At

"FAUST" DRAWS
VAST AUDIENCE
AT THE TIVOLI
There were probably a thousand more
people than seats at the Tlvoll last
night for "Faust," and three hundred
or so of them elected to stand, on their
own feet or their neighbor's feet. The
rest went down Eddy street wondering
why the architects hadn't made the
Tivoli bigger while, they were about It.
They missed a rather curious
"Faust." Of one thing alone in grand
opera one may of course be certain â
that every performance of it will be
different. With the same cast, same
conductor, conditions apparently ex
actly similar, the same Opera will
count up something singularly different.
I venture a prophecy that Saturday's
"Faust" will show many yariations
from last night's. Some are to be
hoped for; others would be deeply
to be deplored. Almost all of Sisnor
Bazelli's Faust, for example, except a j
couple of falsetto notes in the "Salve |
Dinora," would suffer from change. I
Again, take the "Soldiers' Chorus" and
I don't remember a more wooden ren
dering.
That was the curious part of it. The
big things of the opera, mostly, went
indifferently. The unfeatured passages
were frequently quite remarkable in
their beauty.
The "Jewel Song," with Tetrazzini's
jeweled voice behind it, went without a
glitterâwhich brings one to Marguer
ite and Tetrazzini. It is no derogation
of the Tivon diva to say that the part
is out of her scope. It is out of Sem
brich's. Yet, it is the last thing one
would have expected. â¢
Here, in a performance that those j
who best knew her work declared was I
impossible to her. Melba sang and
acted a wonderful Marguerite. The lit
tle Tetrazzini in everything before has .
acted all round Melba. Also she has
had the honor to be compared with her i
as a singer. So ran the promise. But i
it was not until the fourth act that I
the singer got her usual acting grip j
on the situation* Then came a little
scene that thrilled with its portraiture
of despair. The singing, too. I have
heard singers with one-half of the
voice and not a touch of the quality
rake in laurels in the "Jewel Song."
Last right there was hardly even an
attempt at an encore. Neither was the
"King of Thule" anything but a sketch
of that charming ballad. Yet, in some j
of the smaller love scene passages, Te- i
trazzini was exquisiteness itself. As a
whole, however, it is apparent that the
role is not hers.
Bazelli again developed most pleas- \
antly. His voice did not stretch to the
full need of the role and he has many j
faults of method, but he has such a
pleasing quality of voice, such taste,
tenderness and sympathy, and withal \
such a genuine lyrical sense, that these j
carry him very far, and Signor Bazelli <
makes a charming lover. In the garden '
scene his love-making was managed !
with a delicacy and fervor that I re
member combined in no Faust of my
acquaintance since Michelena's.
Rossi, in a remarkably hand
some orange and black satanic con
fection* was the Mephisto. Quite in
tine with the rest of the performance !
his "Calf of Gold" failed of much of its j
effect. Yet Signor Rossi is a singer of !
parts, though in him there is neither a |
De Reszke nor Plancon. nor anything j
even approaching our old Dado. His
voice has neither the mass, brilliance
nor flexibility necessary for the role,
yet he contributed importantly to the
general effect. His devil, from the act
ing side, is a rather benevolent old
person, who, however, at Valentine's
sword cross, shows a highly effective
picture of fear.
Bettini, the Bauermeister of the com- |
pany, was again most .serviceable as
Martha. With the aforementioned !
singers she did excellent work in the I
garden quartet. Miss Eugenic Barker |
was fairly effective as Siebel. Signor i
Romboli. always earnest and sincere, i
was rather out of his depth as Yalen- !
tine, but did his best. Signor Rom- j
boll's tremolo was in uncomfortable j
evidence last night. One wishes he
wouldn't.
And now. honor to Signor Polacco
and the orchestra, that did the best
work of the evening.

MEAGER SUM FOR STATE.
Comparatively little Provided for
Rivers and Harbors.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 24.âThe river
and harbor bill is said to be about
ready to be reported. In any event
California's somewhat meager share in
it may be stated with reasonable cer
tainty. Her apportionment has been
made up subject to change, but a
change Is not probable.
Oakland, which had asked for $718,000
will receive but $250,000 to begin her
great work of improvement. San Luis
Obispo gets $25,000, San Pedro $250,000.
The Sacramento River gets no more
than a provision for her snags, $25,000.
The San Joaquin gets her usual allow
ance of $20,000. For the harbor at
Honolulu $400,000 is appropriated to
carry on a great improvement there.
The entire apportionment is a disap
pointment to the California delegation,
but It Is the same treatment that is
being accorded to every section. Only
in cases of the most urgent necessity
is a full allowance being made. The
total of the bill is about half that of
â¢the last river and harbor bill.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 24.âContrary
to expectations, counsel for the de
fense in the Smoot investigation before
the Senate Committee on Privileges
and Elections did not cdmplete ttfe ex
amination of witnesses to-day. When
adjournment was taken until to-mor

one more witness would be put on the
stand to-morrow. The testimony giv
en to-day was of an unimportant char
acter and much time was devoted to a

mentary evidence offered by the de
fense. .

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
JOHN D. SPRJSCTtELS Proprietor
ADDRESS ALL, COMMUNICATIONS TO
JOHN â¢ Manager
THIRD AND MARKET STREETS, BAN FRANCISCO
WEDNESDAY JANUARY 25, 1905
THE TRANSPORTATION INTERESTS.
THE railroads are massing a great force in Washington to oppose
the policy of the President. Mr. J. J. Hill of the Great Northern
seems to be the field marshal of this well organized army.
. Railroad officials are active among the millions of employes, who arc
â . told that if the President prevail, and succeed in reducing rates, there
must be a corresponding reduction in the wages of the operatives.
This is intended to effect results at the polls. A majority of the
operatives are voters and each voter can influence one or more other
voters, and the campaign will be carried into the next Congressional
election.
The railroad view of the case was put very plainly and very
, : strongly during the late Senatorial contest at Sacramento. The
Union of that city, in an editorial expression, declared the right of
the Southern Pacific to influence the election of a Senator, on the
â¢ ground that it represented an investment of $200,000,000, that was
as much entitled to a voice in that election and in shaping the policy 1
. of legislation as the farmers and manufacturers. But is this argu
.rnent sound? That a railroad has a right to protect itself from in
justice, and defend itself against measures that have mere spoliation ,
for their purpose, no one denies, but that it occupies the same po
sition as rural producers and manufacturers is not true.
The men who from the soil produce the food stock of the coun- j
. â¢ try; and the fibers for its clothing, as well as most of the manufac
turers, have no power to make" the price pf their product. It is
prepared and sent to market, there to be subject to the law of supply
1 . and demand, and as far as its export surplus is concerned to meet
the competition of other countries. The only control its owners
have over it ceases when it leaves their hands and goes to market.
.'* ' -The products of the soil are at the producer's risk. He has to con
tend against wind and weather, frost, flood and drought, and when
these risks are passed has no power to recoup any loss they have
: "caused by adding it to the price paid by the consumer. To reach a
market the producer has to use a railroad or other means of trans- j
portation, and his freight has to be prepaid, or no shipment. Over
. the freight rate he has no control. He has produce to sell and is
â¢powerless to fix its price. The railroad has transportation to sell
â¢:. and fixes its own price, makes its own classification and takes its
â¢ " own time. It does this without regard to whether the producer gets
' any profit or not. It shares none of his losses, assumes no part of
his risks, and is indifferent to his fate, except that it desires him to
produce tonnage which it carries for any rate it chooses to fix.
Now this situation is not one to quarrel about, nor to become
â  ' .socialistic about. It inheres in the nature of things. The power to
.fix a rate for transportation affects every mouthful of food the people
eat, every piece of clothing they wear, every board and shingle, brick
and stone that goes into the houses that shelter them, and every
; pound of coal that warms them or cooks their food. The rate of
â¢ transportation, then, is in the nature of a tax levied upon all of the
necessaries of life, and it is seen at once that the corporations which
. .fix that rate occupy a totally different place, and have a totally dif
ferent relation to the public welfare and to State and national leg
islation, from the producer and manufacturer. It is entirely with
in the power of a railroad company to say where any form of pro
duction shall flourish and where it shall fade. In this State the
railroads can say where flour is to be made and where not. If they
Â° - are getting the benefit of the long haul .into California of any manu
: â¢ factured product, they can prevent the manufacture of that product
â¢ here, no matter what its benefit to the State. To say that a power
of this kind is merely on an equality with the manufacturer and with
'â¢ the tiller of the soil is to do violence to common sense and misrepre
.sent the economic facts. ,
The foregoing statement is not made in a spirit of enmity to
â â¢. â¢ railroads, nor with any desire to incite enmity toward them. Its
truth is known to every railroad manager in the United States. Com
pared with the rest of the world, all railroad rates are cheap in this
country, and our railroad system is an object of pride to our people
â¢ and is the wonder of foreigners. Yet the evidence is indisputable
that in levying a transportation tax upon the producer there are cry
â¢ing inequities. When that tax is rebated to favored shippers the
roads confess that it is higher to the non-favored shippers than it
' ought to be. It is known that on this coast and in this State certain
. producers and certain shippers of lumber and other articles depend
. for their profits upon rebate of this transportation tax. That is not
â¢ a healthy nor reliable condition for business. The shipper that pros
pers under it this year may be ruined by its transfer to another next
year. It is a system that can be used for the advantage of transporta
tion only. The farmer cannot give a rebate on the price of his
products to any favored consumer. He is powerless. Again, railroads
can crush any form of manufacture and obsolete it, ruin its projectors
and' damage the local community, by juggling with rates.
The President proposes only that this vast power shall be sub
ject to Government control, that the levy of the transportation tax

not a proposition to lower rates or to raise them. It is merely a

people shall be put under control.

KLAMATH RECLAMATION SCHEME.
WITH some of our worthy solons the word "recession" has
come to be such a bogey that it is shied from with fear and
much frantic voicing of warnings whenever met. The matter
of the Klamath Lake drainage scheme is a case in point. Because
when the joint action of Oregon and California shall have brought
about the irrigation of thousands of acres of heretofore barren bad
lands, and the marshy borders of upper and lower Klamath lakes
shall have been drained as a consequence, the Federal Government
. will assert its title to all lands so drained, there are certain of the
California Legislature who see in this a dangerous "recession" of
, State lands to the National Government.
Here again, as in the case of the Yosemite, it is necessary to
â¢ call attention to the fact that nothing can be receded to the Federal
Government which already belongs to it by inalienable right. The
tide cf the United States to the beds of such bodies of water as
those of the two lakes along tho northern boundary of the State is
tmdifputed and when a portion of these lake beds is exposed by
dra-.ning joint action of the Oregon and California Legislatures but
makes .formal asseveration of the Federal Government's right to the
Though Oregon's interest in the proposed reclamation project
is paramount, California has a great deal to gain from *he successful
prosecution of the work. By the lowering of the levels of upper and
lower Klamath lakes vast reaches of land in Modoc and Siskiyou
counties in this State and of Klamath County in the neighboring
commonwealth will be turned over to irrigation and made a rich
grass country for stock. The proposed engineering works will neces
sitate the diversion of waters from one State to another. The Gov
ernment reclamation service has made provision for conducting the
.work. It needs only the joint action of the two Legislatures in af
firming the Federal title to marsh lands thus drained to insure the im
mediate commencement of operations. A quibble over "recession"
should not be allowed to divert attention from the main ends in
view.
No change in the South is so great or so promising for lasting effect
as the immigration that is gradually and steadily turning thither. The Com

by suggesting immigration to the South. Railroad agents are at work in the
same direction. Already the process has become visible. In the growth

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 25, 1005.
BREAK O' DAY
HARRISON SMITH
He made his way toward the
sound and beheld Miss Curler.
* +
WHEN Preston stepped out
into the gray November
morning the camp was wrap
ped in silence. Far away to
the east a streak of gold her
alded the coming day. He paused for
a moment to watch a flock of geese
high above his head, winging their
way southward and listening to their
hoarse cries drifting down through
the still morning air.
The giant pines stood grim and
black against the sky and the little
group of log shelters seemed timid
pygmies nestling beneath them for
protection. There was a touch of
frost in the air which set the man's
teeth chattering. He picked up his
gun and strode briskly through the
underbrush toward the little pond
some rods back of the camp.
It was an ideal morning for black
duck, and unless he was vastly mis
taken, he told himself, there should
be quite a flock of them
abou,t the pond. He jammed a shell
into either barrel of the gun and
snapping the breech shut, he began to
move cautiously through the woods,
carefully avoiding the broken twigs
lest the noise of his footsteps should
alarm his quarry.
The last few yards between the
t amp and the pond he covered on his
hands and knees, creeping silently for
ward and pausing now and then to
peer through the half light and listen
intently.
When finally he reached the pond
the band of gold along the eastern
horizon had widened and the light
whs considerably stronger. There were
the ducks, just as he had expected.
In the middle of the pond was a large
flock, while close at hand a dozen
black figures lay quietly on the sur
face of the water.
Very cautiously he raised the gun,
took a long, cool aim at the nearest
birds and pulled the left barrel. To
his unbounded amazement not a bird
rose from the nearest group; the large
flock in the middle of the pond rose
with a great flapping of wings and
hoarse croaks of alarm. He fired at
them with the right barrel, but the
distance was too great for the shot to
inflict any apparent damage on the
retreating flock.
He jumped to his feet and stood
staring at the dozen black dots still
motionless on the water. To his In

GOOD NAME.
Wenneck âWhy do yqu call your
wife a dream?
HenpeckâDreams always go by
contraries.
1 finite chagrin he discovered that those
twelve motionless figures were canvas
decoys, two of them with gaping sides
where his shot had told. He had
wasted his ammunition on the decoys
| while the ducks themselves had flown
away unharmed.
As the ridiculous truth flashed upon
j him Preston uttered a single word
j explosivelyâa short, expressive word.
|In fact, he said "Damn!" and the
manner in which he said it left no
doubt as to his meaning.
As he turned disgustedly from the
pond a peal of merry laughter echoed
from the underbrush. He made his
way toward the sound and beheld
Miss Cuyler seated on the ground, a
gun across her knees and tears of
merriment streaming down her face.
Preston stared at her in amazed help
lessness.
"You here?" he muttered incredu
lously.
The girl held her sides.
"I made an early start for black
j duck, too," she explained, "and -while
I was waiting for the flock to come in
nearer, you came stalking along and
âandâ" She went into another spasm
of merriment.
J"I cameâl sawâand oh! I heard!"
I she gasped, breathless from laughter. ;
j "You heard?" Preston said in dismay. ;
j"I didn't, really intend to say that. It j
: slipped out before I thought."
"I see," she said mockingly. "You'd
' better get the punt and flsh out those
damaged decoys or the story of your
, adventure may get around."
Preston turned to her questioningly.
"Aren't you going to tell the story
to the camp?" he asked.
"No," she said smilingly.
He looked at her with undisguised
relief.
"You are a trump!" he said emphati- '
cally.
She laughed lightly.
I "So long as I've frightened all the
ducks outVf the vicinity with my can
, nonading, I suppose we may as well go
back to camp for breakfast," he sug
gested.
He helped her to her feet and they
trudged back through the underbrush.
Preston noted that she was doubly
pretty with her short skirt and shoot
ing Jacket and the frosty air bringing
out the color in her cheeks. And, of
course, he told himself bitterly, it must
needs be before her, of all women in
the world, that he had made an idiot
of himself.
Half way back to camp the girl
turned to him impulsively.
"I'm going to make a confession,"
she said.
They paused under a tall pine. The
first rays of the sun were lighting the
tree tops.
"You didn't blow holes in both those
decoys," she said. "I fixed the first one
just as you did, an hour before you
came. It was very dark then, you see."
she added by way of extenuation.
"You took a shot at the decoys, too?" |
he crtod.
She"odded slowly.
"You are very generous to tell .me
that," he said with considerable
warmth.
"It's only fair to tell you." she said,
and then added, "You looked so funny
and It would make such a beautiful
story to tell the camp! Now you have
a story on me equally as good. That
will hold my tongue in check."
Preston looked at her gratefully. !
"I'll tell you what let's do," he said
suddenly. "Let's pool our secrets."
"Our duck secrets?" she asked.
"All our secrets," he said, taking her
hand and drawing her to him. "Let's
establish a community of interestsâ
for two."
The girl's glance dropped.
"Ifâif you think bestâ" she began.
"I do," he declared earnestly. "Now
we'll go back to camp and announce it.
It will make almost as good a story as
the one they will never hear."

the human race.
Avoid excesses of all kinds; they are
Injurious. The long life must be a

Never look on the dark side; take
sunny views of everything; a sunny
thought drives away the shadows.
Be a child; live simply and naturally
and keep clear of entangling alliances
and complications of all kinds.
Cultivate the spirit of contentment;
all discontent and dissatisfaction bring

THE SMART SET
In the white and gold ballroom of the

! balls of the winter was given with Mrs.
j George Whittell and Miss Florence
' Whittell as the hostesses.
The guests were received In the
drawing-room adjoining the ballroom,
where great bunches of carnations
stood about In brass vases. Fair, in
all truth, was the young hostess in a
fetching frock of white chiffon satin
and gold, displaying a superb poise,
gained, of course, from the big out-of
doorsâwherein Miss Whittell spends
most of her waking hours.
The guests, numbering about one
hundred, arrived at, the late hour, re
cently established as good form. And
jit was not until nearly midnight that
the ball was in full swing.
Preceding the dance the hostess en
tertained thirty friends at dinner,
mostly of the Burlingame set. As at
the ball, the dinner was a gay affairâ
I and superb In appointments. American
beauty roses and a wildwood of fern
graced the table, with a sweet witchery
of light falling from ruby shades.
Indisputably is the Whittell affair
the smart affair of the weekâalmost of

Buttercups and daisies, baby-blue
eyes and whispering grasses, all fresh

ANNUAL MEETING.
FIFTY-FIFTH CONVENTION OF THE DIOCESE
The fifty-fifth convention of the Epis
copaJ Diocese of California opened at
: -Grace Church, California street, cor
ner of Stockton, yesterday morning. At
10:30 there was celebration of the holy
communion, the Right Rev. Bishop
William Ford Nichols being the cele
brant and preacher.
There was an exceptionally large at
tendance of clergy and laymen and
women, who listened intently to an Im
passioned and deeply spiritual address
:by the Bishop dealing with the con-1
duct of the convention and the liberal
privileges which allowed any one to
speak on the floor of the house.
â He expressed his deep admiration of
â¢ such an institution as the "convention,"
wiiich, he said, was purely American.
.He believed that nothing more im
pressed the Archbishop of Canterbury
when attending the great Protestant
.. -.'Episcopal Convention in Boston, than
â¢ the idea and openness and free expres
"j sion of the convention. In England,
he believed, there is now a movement
â¢for a freer expression of matters per
taining to the church.
Bishop Nichols asked that there be
â¢ no disabilities, but that every parish
'â¢ â¢ might be fully represented, and he made
it clear that no one must feel that he
cannot have in that house a full and
- lair hearing.
. .He considered it "the power house"
which sent pulsation through the dio
cese, and being a "live church," it
' -looked'"live questions in the face.** He
' courted the consideration of the social
as well as spiritual and material ques
â¢ tionjs and hoped that they would have
all-views presented.
â¢ . Sacred music was beautifully ren
. dered by the splendid choir of Grace
. Church under the direction of William
H. Holt, the organist.
BUSINESS IN EARNEST.
At the conclusion of the morning ser
'â¢ vice the whole of the immense delega
tion, as has been the custom for years,
' took luncheon at the Occidental Hotel
and on the assembly reforming in
Grace Church the business of the con
' vention began in earnest.
Bishop Nichols presided and the al
ready large attendance increased with
â¢' th.c arrival of delegates from other
cities.
With expedition the convention began
â¢tp propose officers. No sooner was the
â¢ name of the Rev. Mardon D. Wilson
submitted for secretary, a post of honor
accorded him for many year* than the
. whole convention voted in 1 favor. A
' similar honor was conferred upon
George H. Hooke and the Rev. Clifton

. membered Without opposition they

PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THE PROTESTANT EPISCOPAL DIOCESE OF CALI
FORNIA WHO ARE TAKING AN ACTIVE PART AS DELEGATES IN THE
FIFTY-FIFTH CONVENTION. WHICH OPENED YESTERDAY.
Immediately after such meeting tht
name of the clergyman selected must
be communicated to the Bishop. The
Bishop, if he desires, is to designate a
date for a conference, which date shall
be within twenty days after receiving
notification of the. selection. By the
amendment it will require an affirm
ative vote of two-thirds of the whole
number of vestrymen to elect a rector.
The proposed amendment of section
326 of the Canons was carriecW and |
reads:
The duties of the archdeacon shall be those
of a eene-ral missionary in the diot-ese, under
the dtrection of the Bishop, and adjutant to
the Bishop in the administration of the work
at church extension in the diocese. He shall
be, ex officio, a member of each convocation.
Section 420 was amended so that at
each annual convention there shall be
elected six persons who with the Bishop
of the diocese, ex-officio, shall consti
tute a board of directors of "that cor
poration known as The Protestant
Episcopal Church in the Diocese of
California."
Section 430, (Canon 17). which was
adopted, relates to a Sunday School
commission of the diocese consisting
of nine clergymen and three lay mem
bers to be appointed by the Bishop.
The commission may adopt by-laws
providing for president and other of
ficers.
IMPORTANT DECISION.
By the adoption of an addition to
section 561 all canons enacted, unless
otherwise ordered, take effect after and
on adjournment of the convention in
which they are enacted.
The following important amendment
to the constitution was approved to be

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 25, 1905.
ENCAMPMENT OF GRAND
ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC
Indications That Colonel A. D. Cutler
Will Be Chosen Department Com
mander.
The annual encampment of the
Grand Army of the Republic Depart
ment of California and Nevada, will
take place in Marysville next April.
There are signs of a contest for the
office of commander, with indications
favorable to the election of Colonel
A. D. Cutler of San Francisco. He was
a candidate two years ago, but the en.
campment at that time conferred the
honor of leadership on Major General
Shatter. Colonel Cutler has many
active supporters, and if the large
posts of this city declare in his favor
he will be elected. Word comes from
the north that the people of Tuba
County are making extensive prepar
ations to welcome the veterans and
promote the success of the encamp
ment.
It is better to kiss a girl right under
her nose than behind her back.

CEREMONY IS MEDICINE
Emma Shalich Revives After
Marriage Ceremony Makes
Her Mrs. Walter Bright
4t
When Walter G. Bright went to the
bedside of pretty Emma Schalich of
2816 Golden Gate avenue and asked
her hand in marriage she was in the
shadow of death. They had long been I
lovers, but a few days ago a malig
nant form of appendicitis struck her
down. The potions of the physician
failÂ«d to alleviate her intense pain
and suffering. He feared the shock
of the surgeon's knife, and to the
sembled family and friends said there \
was no hope.
Bright was apprised of the critical
condition of the girl who had plighted
her troth to him. he sought her
bedside and asked to be left alone i
with her. When he emerged he an
nounced that a wedding ceremony waa
to be performed and then was quickly
on his way to the City Hall. The pa- j
tient was found with her sunken eyes
Ut up and her feeble words were
spoken stronger. Shortly Bright re%
turned with Rev. Mr. Liebe of the
Richmond Lutheran Church. The
young man stood at the side of the
bed and lifted the hand of his bride
a trifle as the marriage vows were
spoken. Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Scha
lich. the narents. and a few friends
in the household were in attendance.
The only hope, if any, lay in an
operation, said the doctor. Mrs.
Bright was an hour later conveyed to
the French Hospital. The operation
was performed yesterday, and last
evening the surgeon gave almost posi- L
tive assurance that his patient would
recover.
' She had rallied to a remarkable j
degree before the operation was
formed,"' was his explanation. "She
was not the weak patient that one j
fears will succumb under the knife. ;
She had revived wonderfully and was j
strong and brave for the operation."
Bright was formerly a car con-,
ductor, and a few months ago was
employed as an extra man in the Reg%
istrar's office.
BAIRD'S WIFE AND SISTER
DIFFER OVER ALLOWANCE
Controversy Not Ended in Matter of
Apolieation of Rutli Baird for
Support From Husband.
The young wife of Miles T. Baird,
who !s now under the guardianship of
his mother, and the sister of the young
incompetent, were on the stand in
Judge Coffey'? court late yesterday af
ternoon to give evidence in the con
troversy over the junior Mrs.
Baird's application for an al
lowance of $200 a month out of her
husband's estate. Mr. Baird and his
mother were in court and were
sented by Attorney Partridge, while
Attorney C. J. Heggerty appeared for
the applicant. An attempt of Mr.
Partridge to examine Baird's wife as
to her own income was objected to,
and the objection was sustained. Th&
court held that a wife in entitled to
support from her husband's estate.
Mrs. Baird said that she had received
$200 a month from her husband and
had never asked any questions as to
where it came from. She did not know
that it had been borrowed, but knew
that he had borrowed money, includ
ing from his mother. A
question as to her knowledge of the
trust of the young man's property cre
ated by him was objected to by Mr.
Heggerty. who insinuated that the
proceedings were to be used in the
case in aonther court now pendiug for
dissolution of that trust.
Mrs. Baldwin, sister of Miles Baird,
and secretary of the Baird estate-<:omv
pany, told the court that his income
from the estate was $306 a month.
She also explained how the mother
and sister had tried to pay his debts,
and said, "Before we get through his
debts around town will amount to
$1.0,000. There is interest due. and
people want the money." said Mrs.
Baldwin. Mr. Heggerty asked the
witness whether she had children, afad
receiving an answer in the affirma
tive, inquired whether she thought
Mrs. Baird Jr. needed a nurse for her
child. "I can only reply by saying
that I took care of my own babies,"
said Mrs. Baldwin.
Further hearing went over until
Saturday afternoon.

GATEWAY CAPTURES THE HANDICAP
Defeats the Favorite,
San Nicholas, in
a Drive.
Track at Oakland Is
Muddy and Long
Shots Bloom.
BY FRED E. MULHOLLiAND.
â Venator sported the colors of his new
owner in the seven furlong handicap;
at Oakland yesterday, and if the dis- I
tance had been cut down to the length !
.of the grand stand he would have had j
a royal chance. Coupled in the betting j
with Sea Voyage the pair enjoyed the j
honor of being quoted at 8 to 5 in the J
early betting, and their notoriety ended
there.
"yenator raced off in the lead with
> San Nicholas, the post favorite, to the
far turn, where Michaels, his com
mander, asked for a transfer. San
Nicholas might have won if Davis had
not made such a sweeping turn into
the stretch. He lost more ground than
was necessary there, and at the wire
."Big BUI" Knapp, with the leg up on
Gateway, beat the black horse out a
neck. Ishlana ranes close third. Six
to one could be obtained about the win
= ner.
TWO FAVORITES IX FRONT.
' Bain fell almost incessantly and the
attendance was only fair. Lady Fash
ion and H. P. Kane came home at
"fancy odds, only scatteringly played.
Two favorites earned brackets, Emma
' Reubold and War Times.
' MeÃride, instead of Graham, had the
mount on Emma Reubold in the open
â¢ Ing sprint, and the mare was returned
an easy winner. She had a decided
call in the betting and led Pencil Me
past the judges five lengths. Floriana
Belle, a 40 to 1 shot, took the show.
. .In the five and a half furlong scram
ble following, Hipponax, the favorite,
got away back in the bunch, and failed
Ho ' show among the leaders. Davis,
astride Educate, sneaked away in front
and in a hard drive at the finish,
Â° earned the decision over Batidor. a.9
ts 1 outsider. The show went to Wa
terspout, the mount of Sam Green-
JleJ.d. â 
DEL CARINA FAILS TO LAND.
.' â¢ Boh Smith's filly. Del Carina, light
ened the cinch players by failing to
'finish among the first three in the six
and a half furlong run for three-year
'â  olds. She w\nt to the post at odds of
11 to 20, and. apparently, would not
extend herself any part of it. Lady
Fashion, a 25 to 1 shot from the stable
â¢of M. D. Miller, piloted by MeÃride,
passed Andvari in the stretch, winning
by five open â  lengths. Michaels did
finally succeed in landing third with
Mabel Bates, the second choice.
Two fine choices were hashed up for
the mile ; nd a furlong selling fixture,
ih The Hawaiian and Kickumbob. The
latter was slightly impregnated with
early speed, but Taylor could do noth
ing with The Hawaiian. H. P. Kane
made his first start at the meeting,
and quoted a 25 to 1 shot in the ring,
had the race at his mercy from start
to finish. Minder, astride Mr. Dingle,
disposed of Theodora L for place
honors.
With Modicum scratched. War Times
was installed an even money favorite
for the mile and a sixteenth selling
run. Sam Greenfield rede the black
mare and she led from start to finish.
Langford James lost the place to Glen
arvon. Â§
TRACK NOTES.
Horatius was shipped to Los, An
geles yesterday, where he will start in
the handicap on Saturday. Michaels
will have the mount.
MeÃride was the only rider to pilot
two winners.
"Big Bill" Knapp rode an excellent
race on Gateway.
In a car which reached Oakland
from Los Angeles yesterday morning
were horses representing three stables.
Sais, Tramotor and Cincinnatus are
owned by Mrs. J. Blute; Judge Den
ton by L. A. Bonsack, and Frangible

OVERLAND GOES
INTO A DITCH
Cars of Westbound Limited
Leave the Kails at Early
Hour at Kodak in Nevada
OGDEN, Utah, Jan. 24.âSouthern
Pacific passenger train No. 1, known
as the Overland Limited, which left
here at 3:55 p. m. yesterday, jumped
the track at Kodak, four miles east of
Lovelocks, Nev., about 5 o'clock this
morning, and eight of the ten cars
composing the train left the rails. Re
ports from the scene of the wreck
state that no one was seriously injured,
although several were badly bruised.
The overland was making good
speed when the accident occurred. The
cause of the derailment is ascribed to
the springing of a switchpoint, which
caused the cars to climb the rails. The
accident occurred on a dirt embank
ment. While the passenger cars
ploughed into the ditch the damage to
them was slight.
Shortly after the accident wrecking
crews were sent out to Kodak from
Sparks, west of the wreck, and from
Carlin to the east. It required about
ten hours to clear the right of way to
enable trains to pass.
TOO MUCH EDUCATION
BREAKS UP A HOME
Wife Tires of Husband Who Devoted
All of His Earnings to Improv
ing Her Mind.
EAST ORANGE, N. J., Jan. 24.â
Testimony taken by order of Chan
cellor Magic before Special Master in
Chancery Thomas M. Moore of Passaic
recently in divorce proceedings insti
tuted on October 14 last by Abram
d'Zon, has revealed an unusual story
of domestic discord.
The couple came from their home
in Russia as immigrants nearly twenty
years ago and the wife, then only a
young girl, became possessed with
such a passion for knowledge that
she gave up all thought of home life
and for more than fifteen years studied
night and day, her husband turning
over to her, to enable her to continue
her education, all of his earnings. The
wife, after she had obtained a college
diploma and traveled through Europe,
told him that he was no fit companion
for one of her intelligence and must
live without her.

AT ORMOND, FLORIDA, SUFFER OWING TO
the distressing accident to croker
JURORS RAID
BELDEN PLACE
Sheriff Curtis Disappears
With His Deputies After
Six Warrants Are Served
Under the direction of E. J. Bowes,
chairman of the police committee of
the Grand Jury, Belden place was
raided by a force of deputy sheriffs
last night. Foreman Andrews was a
spectator, holding aloof from Â«active
operations, for Judge Hebbard has en
joined him and Juror Davis from enter
ing the houses to make arrests. The
purpose of the raid was to test the
writ. Bowes was not named in the
injunction and it therefore devolved
upon him to bid defiance to the court.
The Grand Jury is very indignant at
Judge Hebbard's action, and according
to Foreman Andrews the Judge Is tc
be made the subject of a thorough in
vestigation.
The raid was largely farcical. Pri
vate detectives had sworn out war
rants for the arrest of six of the
women, and it was the purpose of the
grand jurors to accompany the officers
and authorize the arrest of many more.
But Sheriff Curtis, fearful of Judge
Hebbard's stern Injunction, disappeared
with his deputies as soon as the half
dozen warrants had been served. The
grand jurors went on making arrests
without warrants in the belief that the
alley was bristling with deputies eager
for commands.
Juror Speck captured two women and
was leading them off to prison when
Attorneys Mack and Nagle appeared
with loud calls on the prisoners to re
sist and louder threats of suits for dam
ages against the juror. William V.
Bryan, secretary of the Grand Jury,
came along with three more of the
painted habitues. He quailed instanter
when the strong voice of Lawyer Mack
spoke. The mention of a suit for dam
ages gave the juror a nervous start
that loosened his grip on the women
and threw his hands into the air.
Speck had more fight in him and
insisted on taking his prisoners off to
jail. He appealed in vain for help
from Bryan, for the women were strug
gling vigorously. Deputy Sheriff Mc-
Manus came along at this juncture and
Bowes called on him to take the pris
oners to the lockup. McManus, uncer
tain in his fear of Judge Hebbard.
hesitated. Bowes was so full of energy
about it, however, that the deputy
sheriff finally complied. The lawyers
then raised a hue and a cry for the
women to break away. There was
much struggling, and finally McManus
let them go.
District Attorney Byington declared
last night that he would have warrants
sworn out, charging Nagle and Mack
with interfering with an officer.
Greater excitement isi looked for to
day, for it is expected that Judge Heb
bard will take some drastic measures.
At least, the grand jurors are expect
ing trouble, and hope to bring matters
to an issue with him.
Policemen were stationed In front of
620 Jackson street and 1129 Dupont

BERKELEY DESIRES CHANGE
IN REGARD TO COACHES
Would Leave the Matter" Open to In
dividual Action at Each
University.
BERKELEY, Jan. 24.âThe question
whether graduate football coaches
shall be engaged to handle the respec
tive Berkeley and Stanford football
elevens this year was discussed at
much length to-night by the executive
committee of the associated students,
preliminary to the intercollegiate com
mittee meeting Saturday in San Fran
cisco. Though no definite Instructions
were given the Berkeley members of
that committee thÂ« trend of opinion
was toward allowing each university
to do as it pleased In the selection of
coaches. In short, the view predom
inated that the intercollegiate com
mittee should leave the matter of
coaches open to individual university
action.
Ezra Decoto and Leo Bishop, two of
Berkeley's intercollegiate representa
tives, took part in the discussion.
Everett Brown, the third Berkeleyan,
was absent. It is not expected Sat
urday's conference will result in def
inite action, as each university will
desire to receive a report before the
final decision shall be given. President
Wheeler has received an Invitation
from the El Paso, Tex., Chamber of
Commerce to send the university foot
ball team to El Paso in November to
play the Louisiana State University
eleven.
Nick Williams, who graduated in
1902, and who played as pitcher for
the Seattles last season, was appointed
baseball coach. The committee award
ed medals to Hans Lisser, Henry Finch
and Harry Rogers, authors of "The
Mon From Stanford," last season's
football farce.

FIGHTERS SET
A FIST PACE
Neil and Hyland Take Suf
ficient Work to Condi
tion Pair of Heavy Weights
WILL TAPER OFF SOON
Rest Will Be in Order for
the Tiny Boxers Within
a Few Days of the Match
Frankie Neil and Dick Hylandare
still taking enough exercise to fit a
couple of heavyweight boxers for the
ring, but they will soon commence to
taper off. Hyland went on the road
yesterday morning and In the after
noon he boxed ten hard rounds with
two sparring partners. He wanted to
go six rounds with each of them, but
the pace was too hot for one glove
wielder and he retired after four
rounds.
Whether the joke is on Frankie Neil
or Trainer Frank McDonald was the
principal topic of conversation dis
cussed yesterday at the former's train
ing quarters. It happened like this:
On Monday night the boys attended a
vaudeville show and the feature of the
programme was the great train rob
bery, shown on the Biograph. Frankie
Neil was deeply impressed with the
scene and talked robbers all the way
home. In the small hours of the morn
ing Frank McDonald was roughly
shaken out of a sound sleep and com
manded to throw up his hands. After
rubbing his eyes he realized Neil had
the nightmare and told him to go back
to bed.
Without warning Neil swung a right
and a left and yelled "Bang, bang;
you're dead." The right hit the bed
post and Mac smiled, but the left
caught him in the eye.
In the morning, when Frankie was
awakened, he immediately said: "Gee,
I'm glad I'm aWake. I dreamt I was
a robber and shot a guy." Mac in
formed the boys of Frankie's escapade
and thinks he has a joke on him. The
boys are inclined to think McDonald
is the victim, however, by the look of
his optic.
Neil is working hard for his coming
battle and while he does not hold Hy
land cheaply he thinks he will surely
be declared the winner.
Trainer McDonald has him in fine
shape and says Frankie can go into the
ring at a moment's notice. McDonald
has trained Neil for all his fights but
two, and on those occasions the little
bantam lost the verdict. Frankie thinks
Mac the only trainer living. Although
the rain fell in torrents yesterday
Frankie donned his old clothes and hit
the road for six miles.
In the afternoon he and Young Cor
bett spent o\ r er an hour In the gym
nasium, going through the routine
work at a fast pace. Frankie will take
a rest to-day and go duck shooting
with Young Corbett.
There has been but little betting up
to the present Jime. Nell will ap
parently be made an overwhelming
favorite as this is Hyland's profes*
sional debut and he is supposed to lack
experience. Both boys are hard hit
ters, Neil especially having a wicked
left hand. ,
HAWTHORNE CLUB BOUTS.
Matchmaker Young Arranges a Prom
ising Series of Boxing
Matches.
The Hawthorne Athletic Club offi
cials are making big preparations for
their initial boxing show, which will be
givefl In Woodward's Pavilion Friday
night. This is the club's first venture
in the boxing game. It would not have
gone into the promoting business but
for the need of money to buy gymnasi
um apparatus and to repair the build
ing it occupies. Matchmaker Al Young
has prepared an excellent programme
and it promises to result in one of the
best shows of the year. Seven con
tests are on the card and each will be
of four rounds duration.
The main event will be a four-round
"go" between Lew Powell of the Haw
thorne Athletic Club and Bob Cairns
for the amateur lightweight champion
ship of the coast. The pair are in
training and will Weigh in at the ring
side at 135 pounds. Cairns is power
ful and clever and has been defeating
the best men of his weight in the city.
Powell is exceptionally clever and has
a stiff punch. A "roughhouse" battle
is expected between Frank Mayfleld
and "Roughhouse" McDonald. These
two are hurricane fighters and should
put up a fast exhibition.
Two special events will be fought be
tween such clever amateurs as Eddie
Kehoe and Harry Baker, Harry Ten
ny and Frankie Edwards. Tenny is
the youth who visited Hyland in his
training quarters and electrified the
crowd by making such a good showing
against Richard for four rounds and
taking many damaging -blows without
wincing. The winner of the Kehoe-
Baker contest will be matched to fight
George Finnigan. Young Dempsey and
George Curran will meet in a return
match. They put up a hard fight last
week. Pete Sullivan, who beat Artie
Granfleld so decisively at the Olympic
Club, will go against Jim Keegan. This
will be the curtain raiser. Eddie Smith
of Oakland will referee all the contests
Willie Wolf Is training hard for his
bout with Charley Dunne, and these
two ought to put up a hard battle.
Dunne beat a professional "ringer" last
month and Is improving all the time.
Wolf is a brother of Ted and can go
some himself.

Foreman Andrews of Grand
Jury Tells of Unsuccess
ful Grill of Chan Cheung
IS QUESTIONED BY BUDD
Claims His Mind Is in Con
dition to Act With Impar
tiality as to Defendant
. Further argument on the challenge
to the Grand Jury in regard to the in
dretment against Chan Cheung, charg
ing, him with the murder of Tom Yick
of the Chinese Educational Society,
â¢was'heard by Jurge Lawlor yesterday
mofning. The point In dispute was as
to whether the condition of the mind
of Foreman T. P. Andrews was such
as to enable him to act with entire im
partiality in finding the indictment. It
was Anally decided to continue the ex
amination of Foreman Andrews.
Foreman Andrews, in answer to
questions by Attorney James H. Budd,
admitted that the object of taking
phan* Cheung from his home and de
taining him for over forty hours was
to get from him, If possible, the ad
mission that he was the go-between
In regard to the bribery fund supplied
by Chinese gamblers for police pro
tection. Chan, he said, was too clever
for them, and be believed that Chan
was not telling the truth when he told
them he knew nothing about it. |
Chan was grilled for five or six hours,
and .was then taken to a room in a
hotel, where he was closely guarded.
"Why did you keep him locked in
a. room for so many hours after the
grilling was concluded?" asked Budd.
"Well, â¢we were informed that he
would.give up," replied Andrews.
Budd wanted to know who gave him
that Information, but the question was
objected to by Assistant District At
torney Ferral. Objection sustained.
"YVas it Mr. Carpenter?" again
asked Budd, and the same objection
â¢was:held good.
Andrews said he did mention to
Chan about the murder of Tom Yick,
and that he presided when the de
rision was reached to Indict him. He
aid . not .vote, as he told the other '
Grand Jurors that he had reasons foi I
jt which might disqualify him. He !
was satisfied that notwithstanding
â¢what he believed about Chan and the j
Chinatown corruption fund his mind
-ft'as in such a condition that he could
'have acted fairly and Impartially in
the'premises.
E. J. Bowes, chairman of the Po
â¢lice Committee of the Grand Jury, was ;
raljed to testify, but his answers were
evasive and nothing definite was ell- |
cited to show whether Foreman An
drews was prejudiced against Chan. !
The case was continued till Saturday. â¢

A' large party of Rayraond-Whltcomb

These days are record making days

ower his own record on the links.
Everybody about the hotel is

RAIN DELAYS THE LOADING OF
THE BIG MANCHURIA
Will Sail for the
Orient on Next
Saturday.
Pacific Mail Wharf
Piled High With
Freight.
The Pacific Mail Company's liner
Manchuria, Captain Saunders, will
sail Saturday for the Orient. The
rain, which has fallen almost con
tinuously since she arrived, has added
considerably to the difficulty of dis
charging and loading, and it will be
only by the efforts of a large army of
stevedores working night and day
that the big ship will be ready for sea
on schedule time.
The Manchuria brought from the
Orient more than 12,000 tons of cargo.
This will all have to be discharged and
14,000 tons placed on board before the
Manchuria is ready to leave. On ac
count of the rain the work of dis
charging has to be done under cover,
and this hampers the work to a se
rious extent. Inability to move the
freight from the wharf as fast as it
Is discharged and lack of wharf space
in which to stow the unloaded cargo
has caused a serious congestion and
leaves little space for handling the
outward cargo.
When the new wharves are com
pleted problems like this will have no
dread for the men responsible for
loading and discharging ships, but un-.
der present conditions life on the Pa
cific Mail wharf is chockful of ex
citement.
The Manchuria will carry a large
number of passengers for the Far
East.
Overdue Bark Arrives.
The British bark Loch Etive, 186 days from
Melbourne, arrived yesterday at Queenstown.
She was quoted for reinsurance at 20 per cent.
The arrival of the Loch Btive led to the re
duction In the rates on the French bark
Neomi and the Norwegian*ship Norge, from
15 to 8 per cent. The British bark Lord Elgin,
out 136 days from Sydney for Falmouth, was
reported spoken and her name was removed
from the overdue list. She was quoted at 15
per cent. The British bark Stork, out 127
days from Hudsons Bay for London, Is quoted
at 80 per cent and the German bark Robert
Rickmers, out 225 days from Philadelphia for

Nearly on the Rocks.
The scow schooner Emille Martin, bound for
Tiburon, narrowly escaped going ashore Mon
day night on Dime Point. Her anchor, which
had dragged until the little vessel was dan-,
gerously near the rocks, suddenly took a hold
ing grip and the Emilie was safe.
ThÂ« life saving crew responded to her sig
nals of distress and one of Crowley's launches
stood by the schooner for four hours waiting
to tow her off. The anchor, however, had
fouled the cable. It could not be cleared and
the Emilie's captain hesitated about cutting
his cable. When the tide turned the Emilie
drifted out of danger.
Water Front Notes.
The steamship Centennial, which ran into
the Kosmbs liner Amasls a few days ago on
Puget Sound* arrived yesterday 116 hours from
Seattle, looking little the worse for her en
counter with the German steamer. The Cen
tennial is the grandmother of all the coasters
and is one of the most ancient vessels now
in commission. She was built forty-six years
ago and In her long career has sailed many
seax for many masters. Captain Pierce, at
one time marine superintendent here of the
army transport service, is her commander.

DUNSMUIR CASE IS STILL
BEFORE COMMISSIONER
J. J. Dwyer Talks of Probate law and
Indulges In Tilts With Sir Charles
Tapper.
The Dunsmuir case is still going on
before Consul Bennett. J. J. Dwyer
was the only witness before the board
yesterday. His testimony was of the
same order as that he has given dur
ing the last ten days.
Sir Charles H. Tupper conducted
cross-examination, and, as heretofore,
asked the witness to make his answers
to the questions as brief as possible,
but in each instance the witness re
plied that he could only answer in the
way that he thoaght would explain
his ideas on the subject.
The case will be resumed at 10
o'clock this morning. Expert Dwyer
will again be the star witness.. From
present indications it will be several
days before his testimony will be con
cluded. m
J. A. S. Lowe will follow ram. and
one or two other witnesses will then
be called.

FISK DISRATES
BEN M'KINLEY
Assistant Postmaster Given
Position of Money Order
Clerk at a Lower Salary
Postmaster Fisk yesterday after
noon announced that he had trans
ferred Ben F. McKinley from the po
sition of Assistant Postmaster at $3000
per annum to that of money order
clerk at $1200 per annum In place of
W. J. Phillips, who resigned last Mon
day for the purpose of practicing law.
Mr. Fisk explained that since he
had become Postmaster, which was
thirteen months ago, he had intended
to transfer Mr. McKinley at the first
opportunity, as the appointment be
longed to him. â¢
"I wanted to hold him in the de
partment," added Mr. Fisk, "and so
I deferred removing him from the po
sition he held until a vacancy should
occur."
Mr. McKinley, or "Uncle Ben," as
he is affectionately called. Is 74 years
old and has been employed in the San
Francisco postoffice for more than
twenty-five years. At the time of the
election of his nephew, President Mc-
Kinley, "Uncle Ben" held the position
of Superintendent of one of the sub
stations in this city. After President
McKinley's inauguration he was pro
moted to the position of Assistant
Postmaster at a salary of 53000 per
annum.
Hull McClaughry, who was appoint
ed secretary when Postmaster Fisk
took the office, succeeds Mr. McKln
ley, as Assistant Postmaster, and
W. F. Burke, a well known
newspaper man, assumes the place va
cated by Mr. McClaughry.
The other changes are: Miss Alma
E. Bartling, transferred from Station
34 In the ferry building to the money
order division; J. A. Wagner, from
Presidio substation to Station 34; Mrs.
Abbie M. Atkinson, from Station H to
Station 36 in the Mills building; Mrs.

try division.

YOELL'S VALET
ON THE STAND
John Kay Declares That
His Employer Wrote and
Destroyed Many Wills
CLAIMS HE WAS CLOSE
Servant Says That Santa j
Clara Pioneer Was Too
Stingy to Buy a Drink
â¢
"I got tired of witnessing wills for
him," declared John Kay, former valet
of J. Alexander Yoell, in Judge Kerri
gan's court yesterday.
Kay testified that his master seemed
to take a delight in writing wills, only
to destroy them and* write others. This
is one of the reasons that the valet, j
introduced by the contestants to prove
tiMtt Yoell was not of sound mind when |
he made the will in favor of the chil- â¢
dren of his first wife, thinks the Santa
Clara pioneer was insane.
All sorts of suspicions regarding the j
children of both wives clouded the old 1
man's mind during his last years, ac- j
cording to Kay. The valet relates an j
incident that happened near the Cliff ;
House shortly before the father of the
two families died. "Mr. Yoell was lean
ing on my arm," said Kay. "He said
he was going to die soon. Then he saw ;
a strange gentleman looking at us. He i
flew into a rage and said 'The is |
Bpying on me!' I think that he was !
crazy."
On cross-examination by D. M. Del- ;
mas, Kav said that Yoell had often j
declared that the children of his second
wife were only waiting for him to die,
so that they could get his property by !
proving that he was of unsound mind.
The valet testified that Yoell finally
became suspicious of him and charged
him with being a spy. Kay was dis
charged in August, 1899.
The valet told in detail how Yoell be
came suspicious of his children, one by '
one, and how he even quarreled with
Mrs. Evelyn Levy, who became exec
utrix of his will. Quaint revelations as
to Yoell's penuriousness were made by
the valet.
"Was Yoell a drinking man?" asked
one juror.
"No, sir; he was too stingy," replied j
Kay. The valet told how his master !
had at one time bought 10 cents' worth J
of cherries at a market to save car
fare to go home for lunch.
William Klummenacher, who worked
around Yoell's home at San Jose, re- j
lated incidents Intended to show that â ]
the Santa Clara pioneer was not of
sound mind.
He declared that one day the old man
disturbed the house with shrieks for
"Allie." The witness said that when
he attempted to soothe his employer.
Yoell became furious and continued to
shout for Allie.
The case will be taken up at 11 a. m.
to-day, when depositions from wit
nesses who are living in San Jose will
be read. Nearly all the children of
Yoell were present yesterday.
POLICE PUZZLED OVER
A MISSING CLIPPING
Filed as Evidence in Burglary Case,
but It Cannot Be Found at
Defendant's Trial.
James Mickens, alias John Williams,
a colored man, was convicted by a
jury in Judge Dunne's court yesterday
on a charge of burglary and was or
dered to appear for sentence on Jan
uary 28. He entered the saloon of
Gcmez and Gilmette, 412 Pacific street,
on July 27 and stole several articles,
Including a gold watch.
A feature of the case was the disap
pearance of a clipping from a receipt
book of William Schmalz, a pawn
broker on Market street The clipping !
bore the signature of John Williams j
and at the preliminary hearing- before I
Judge Mogan Theodtjre Kytka, hand- I
writing expert, testified that from an j
examination of the defendant's signa
ture on the prison book the signature j
"John Williams" was also written by 1
him. The receipt was for the gold
watch stolen from the saloon.
At the trial yesterday it was dis
covered that the clipping could no\ be
found. It was filed as evidence in
Judge Mogan's court and no traces of i
it could be found after that. It j
should have been taken by Detectives j
ODea and Mulcahy, the arresting of
ficers, to thf) property clerk, but the
property clerk had no record of hay- j
Ing received it. The result was that
when Kytka was called to testify yes- |
terday his evidence was objected to '
and the objection was sustained. An j
investigation will probably be made to j
ascertain who is responsible for the 1
disappearance of the clipping.
Ragan Warns Dairymen.
Health Officer D. F. Ragan and
Chief Inspecting Physician W. C. Hass
ler yesterday went out on a very early
morning visit to the dairies of this city.
Ragan said that arrests of owners who j
permit their employes to violate the ;
provisions of the pure milk ordinance
would be made and furthermore that ,
if the former do not show a willing- '
ness to comply with the regulations \
he will recommend that their per- |
mits to sell milk be revoked. This
completes the dairy inspection of San
Francisco for the purpose of rating
the same and a rigid inspection will be
made of the dairies in outside counties
that supply milk to San Francisco.
RUN THEATERS WITHOUT PERMITS. â
Warrants were sworn out yesterday for the
arrest of Dennis Qrauman of the Unique Thea
ter, Ed Homan of the Midway Plalsance,
Samuel LoveTtch of the Novelty Theater and
E Fried of the Mission Theater for conduct-
Ins a place of amusement without having a
permit from the Board of Public Works. They
were arrested and released on cash bail.
CLAY STREET
ENDS AT PARK
City Engineer Reports That
Thoroughfare Does Not
Cross Lafayette Square
NOT ON OFFICIAL MAP
Â»
Contention of Owners of
One Block Is. Submitted
to Attorney for Opinion
Â»
City Engineer Woodward filed a re
port yeterday with the Board of Public
Works to the effect that Clay street
does not run through Lafayette Square
between Gough and Laguna streets, as
It is not delineated on the official map
as a public thoroughfare between the
streets named. The report says that
the land that would constitute Clay
Btreet were It to be continued westward
is part of the square and therefore is
under the Jurisdiction of the Park Com
missioners.
The report was filed as the result of
the petition of property owners that
the city fix the responsibility for the
proper care of parts of the blocks form
ing the connecting links of streets ow
ing to the fact that rubbish and gar
bage was allowed to accumulate there
on. The Park Commission has been
caring for the two blocks on the
westerly side of Lafayette Square, but
has not cared for the easterly blocks
owing to the litigation involving title to
same.
The Holladay estate and others have
been adjudged to be the proprietors of
the block bounded by Gough, Octavia,
Clay and Washington streets, contain
ing six fifty vara lots.
The City Engineer thinks submission
of the question to the City Attorney for
an opinion would be proper and he so
advises the Board of Public Works.

City LoU Accurately and Officially Surveyed.
CHARGES REASONABLE.
My Held book*, diagrams show, by actual
measurements, the exact points from which
your lot was surveyed, which is Imperatively
necessary, as tha City Surveyor and other sur
veyor* do not show that, and also because all
the original monuments were taken out when
the streets were formed in the early days of
the city, since which time the different City
Surveyors extending to the pre*ent time have
made innumerable error* in their street and
lot surveys, and to conceal such errors they
have moved the monument lines away from
their original correct positions without legal
authority from the people, causing blocks and
streets to measure incorrectly, creating excess
measurements In blncks of the most valuable
portion of the city, wnich they do not distribute
proportionately throughout tho block, but often
give the entire excess of sometime* 12 Inches
or more to one person, thereby interfering with
the deed distances of the people and the abso
lute security of boundary lines.
Consult me before moving your valuable
buildings on such unfair surveys. Work guar

RESUMES DUTY
OF HIS POST
General Francis Moore Takes
Up Command of the De
partment of California
SHERIDAN SAILS TO-DAY
Transport "Will Leave for
Manila Crowded With
Passengers and Freight
General Francis Moore resumed the
duties of his post as commander of the
Department of California yesterday.
He was pleased with his visit to the
Hawaiian Islands. He was not favor
ably impressed with the location of
Camp McKinley, and thinks some of
the other Government reservations
there would better serve for a perma
nent camp. The only troops there now
are the Twenty-eighth Company Coast
Artillery in command of Lieutenant W.
W. K. Hamilton, and the Ninety-second
Company Coast Artillery in command
of Captain Henry B. Farrar. The post
is in command of Lieutenant Colonel
John McClellan. As these are the
only three officers at that post, they
are forced to do double duty, and only
occasionally get an opportunity to go
into Honolulu. For this reason they
are not well pleased with the station.
This trip to Honolulu ends the in
spections of the posts belonging to this
department, with the exception of posts
at Benicia, Monterey and San Diego.
These will be inspected by General
Moore in the near future. General
Moore will retire from the army on
April 5 and will make his home in Cali
fornia. His aid, Lieutenant Creed F.
Cox, will then resume his duties with
the Eleventh Cavalry, now stationed at
Dcs Moines.
Mrs. Francis Moore and her daugh
ter, Miss Jessie Moore, are still in
Honolulu, and will return here on the
transport Logan about February 15.
The transport Sheridan will sail for
Manila at noon to-day. She goes as
an extra, occasioned by the great
amount of freight and a large number
of casuals that were awaiting trans
portation.
Following is the list of passengers:
Colonel Thomas C. Lebo. Fourteenth Caval
ry-; Major William R. Rochester Jr.. pay
master V. S. A.; Major Frank Greene, wife

tirely recovered from her illness oc
casioned by her sojourn in the Philip
pines.

BOY FOOTPADS
RAID GROCERY
Three Men in Pear of Store
on Geary Street, Near Ma
son, Are Quickly Robbed
THIEVES MAKE ESCAPE
Proprietor Follows Them for
Two Blocks, but Loses the
Trail on Arrival of Police
Two young footpads entered the
side door leading to the bar in the
rear of a grocery at Martha place and
Geary street, between Mason and Tay
lor, at 11:15 o'clock last night and
held up the proprietor and two other
men in the room, taking $30 from the
cash drawer and about $40 from the
victims.
The proprietor of the store is John
Stelling, and according to his state
ment the footpads were boyish loking
and apparently novices at the work.'
Stelling and Robert Thurman were
seated at a small table in the rear
room, playing cribbage, while R. Car
son stood watching the game.
Suddenly the side door on Martha
place was thrown violently open and
two masked figures stumbled in. Both
were of slight build and wore hand
kerchief masks and soft hats. One
carried a pair of revolvers and com
manded the party to throw up their
hands.
The occupants of the room needed
no second invitation and three pairs
of hands went up under the persua
sion of the revolvers in the hands of
one men. The other went to
the cash drawer and through the
pockets of the three men. In his haste
he overlooked a wallet in Stelling's
pocket containing $200.
Keeping the men covered, the foot
pads backed out of the door and ran
up Geary street to William, down Wil
liam to O'Farrell. where they entered
a building. Stelling followed them,
yelling lustily for the police, and in
response to his calls Policeman M.
Behan appeared. The trail had been
lost, however, and Detective Wren is
working on ttie case.
SAYS EVIDENCE
SHOCKS NERVES
On Friday there may be a sensation
in Judge Graham's court in the
Vincent case, if the promises of Mrs.
Vincent's attorney. Ferman, are made
good. Mrs. Vincent is suing her hus
band, "William, for separate mainten
ance and the hearing was to have gone
dh yesterday noon, but Vincent was
not in court. His attorney. George Av
erill,. explained that the husband and
father had been so overcome by the
testimony of his wife and daughters,
and by the hints of their attorney, that
he had succumbed to nervous collapse.
Judge Graham was not satisfied, and
ordered an attachment to be issued for
Vincent's person. The man appeared at
2 o'clock, armed with a physician's
certificate as excuse for his absence.
It was apparent that Mr. Ferman
could have taken judgment for his
client on the proof adduced of the de
sertion of the husband, as charged in
the complaint, but the lawyer was n*>t
content to rest. He told the court
that he wanted an opportunity to pro
duce all of the evidence in this "hor
rible, extraordinary case," and then he
begged the court to ask the newspaper
men not to use the names he would di
vulge, "because a human life depends
upon it." He explained that the moth
er of the girl who will be accused of be
ing too friendly with Vincent would be
shocked to death upon hearing the dis
closures. Ferman demanded a further
opportunity for cross-examining Vin
cent and asked the court to issue sub
penaes for certain witness if they de
cline to appear. Among other things,
he intends to prove that Vincent made
arrangements to marry his inamorata
before he asked his wife to permit him
to get a divorce.
Judge Seawell, who has had the case
under submission, yesterday granted
an interlocutory decree of divorce to
Martha E. Braham from Louis Bra
ham, a vaudeville artist. They were
married on September 1. Other di
vorces were granted thus: By Judge
Hebbard to William H. Whelan from
Mina Whelan, who hurled beer bottles
at him; t) Catherine Hart from Mich
ael Hart, desertion; by Judge Troutt
to Warren A. Lester from i'lorence E.
Lester, desertion.
Suits for divorce were filed by Nora
Ren worth from George Renworth, de
sertion; Zada C. Lee from William J.
Lee, neglect.
Mangled by Machinery.
C. M. Carsoul. an employe of the
Union Iron Works, was caught in the
machinery of a traveling crane yester
day and received injuries that may re
sult in his death. Both of the man's
legs were terribly mangled and his en
tire body was covered with ugly, lace
rated wounds. He was taken to the
Pctrero Hospital, where Dr. Buell
found it necessary to amputate the
mangled limbs. Carsoul's home is at
215 Arkansas street.
Tells of Indian Life.
E. S. Curtis gave an interesting lec
ture at the Press Club last night upon
the subject of American Indians. The
lecture was illustrated by a number
of slereopticon views. For the last
sir years Mr. Curtis has made a study
of Indian life and his stories and
anecdotes gave pleasure to the audi
ence of nearly 200, a large percentage
of which was the fair sex.

Men Who Helped to Build California
Extend Open House to
Many Guests.
The Society of California Pioneers
gave a reception at Pioneer Hall last
night in commemoration of the dis
covery of gold in California. Over 900
persons accepted the hospitality of the
Pioneers and until midnight two floors
of the building were filled with guests
and members. An orchestra on each
floor furnished dance music.
A dainty supper was served at 10
o'clock and around the tables the old
Argonauts told tales of "the days of
old, the days of gold, the days of '49."
Among those who spoke interestingly
of the good old times were: William L..

\ GENERAL SUMMARY,
f â ;'The weather waa generally warm and cloudy
â r in -all part* of the State, with frequent heavy
rains', in all sections at the beginning and close

ho - *erlotis damage by the continued rain*,
1 though farming operation* have been consid
erably â¢retarded. The seasonal rainfall in the
central and southern section* 1* more than
double that of last season.
'' â¢ *The .soil Is thoroughly saturated and in *ome
- .places' 1* too wet for cultivation, but In other
. sections plowing and seeding are In progress.
The grain acreage is reported much larger than
" last Reason's in nearly all sections and wili
â¢ bi considerably Increased as soon as condi
tions pewnlt. Early sown grain is in excel
lent, condition and making fair growth, but
.would be greatly benefited by a few days of
sunshine. .Alfalfa is looking well and making
â¢good" growth. Green feed i* abundant in all
â¢ections and cattle are In prime condition.
Prospects for excellent crops of all kinds were
never better at this time of the year.
. " .Oranges and lemon* continue in good oondl
' tlon and have not been seriously injured by
frost this season. Pl.-klng and shipping are
progressing rather slowly on account of the
wet weather. The lemon crop In Southern
v'aliTornla is rejorted larger and better than
u/sual.
' SACRAMENTO VALLEY. âThe continued

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK Jan. 24.âThe most notahl*
fact about trading In rtocka to-day was the
decided Â»Ãb*ldence of activity. Jiven with
yesterday's excitement the total dealings for
that day fell below last week's average, which
was above a million share*, and to-day that
average would have been fuily cut In half
but for- th* spasm of liquidation at the close,
"ho xuarkrt became almost idle at tunes and
the movement of prices wa* Intensely sluggish
. until near the close. The tone, however,
: ahowed evident improvement over that of yes
â¢ terday. and prices started upward briskly from
the outset. Thl* waa due in large part to
the lea* alarming view taken of the course
of- events In Russia. The idea that an im
; mediate overthrow of the existing Government
was threatened wa* pretty definitely dismissed.
There wa* some disposition to argue that
Russia* internal troubles might have the
eviect of hastening the conclusion of peace
with Japan and the cutting off of the enormous
expense of the war. with the possibility of a
positive benefit resulting to the finances of
the empire. But the foreign situation had lit
tle effect here except in a negative way, when
there was a cessation of the foreign pressure
to .liquidate American securities agalnat
threatened losses in other direction*. From
.'â¢'â * influence there was a normal tendency
'owiard- recover}'. In a few individual stocks
there was a resumption of attempt* to lift
price*. But the motives of the buyers in
these cases were rather vague and not dis
closed to the general public. Their sym
pathetic effect on the general list was also
â  very moderate. The renewed rise in Northern
Securities on the curb revived all the long
standing rumors pointing to the widespread
reiults to be expected from the settlement
out of the Northern Securities case.
The gupnosed imminence of the announcement
of tbe Southern Pacific refunding plan was a
contributory cause to the firmness of the
tir.rrimaji stocks. There was a disposition to
-attribute the movement In Eri*. which waa
â¢qutte conspicuous, to a *uppo*ed connection
with the wide-reaching settlement of the
Northern Securities case, which Is a potent
mystery for stimulating all sort* of move
ments, in the market. But the firmness of
the coaler* had a more substantial explana
tion In the eettlement of net earnings for De
oemb-ta- of the Central Railroad of New Jer
â¢ey d,Â»cloÂ«tng favorable conditions not only
1n ...* i Kb leVÃ ' of earnings, but in a
cutting down of operating expenses. Reports
of heavy orderr, by railroads for bridge ma
yL rla we 2L a helD to United State* Steel pre
rerrea. The initiation of dividend* on Hide
and Leather preferred wa* a favorable in
fluence on the indurtrial list generally. A
faarp /Uo In the international mercantile
marine stocks on the curb was also an in
fluence In thÂ« Industrial list. But tha de
mand for stocks easily ran out all the higher
levels in the cases of all the day's advances
and there was a sprinkling of declines which
kept the tcne irregular fqr most Mt the day.
Commission-house business was on a small
scale and there was a clearly discernible dis
position among operator* outside of limited
professional circles to maintain a waiting at
titude in the speculation for the present. The
unsatisfactory response of the market to the
advance in prices caused Â«ufflcient disappoint
ment to Induce the active selling of the last
half hour, which more than wiped out the
> laborious gains of the previous four and a
half hours and closed the market weak and
at net losses.
The bond market was irregular. Total sales,
par value, $6,565,000.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
call.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Jan. 24.âFear of developments
in the Russian situation restricted trade in '
wheat to-d_y. The result was a decline of %
<B>%e. In view of easier cables, the Russian
disturbances did not appear to be regarded
abroad as likely to disturb commerce. In
consequence Russian affairs were seemingly
given little weight as a direct influence.
Their effect, however, was felt as a decided i
drag In speculation. The market opened easy
under a pressure of heavier receipts in the i
Northwest. May started %c off at $1 1 ,
and there was a further decline to $1 14 %@
1 14%. Uncertainty as to possibilities In Rus- !
sla was said to be keeping the larger specu
lative Interests out of the market. Business
was restricted mainly to balancing of trades ;
between small operators. Not until receipts
at St. Louis and Kansas City were made
known did a marked diversion in the course <
of theÂ» market occur. Shorts, who regarded
receipts of 82,000 bushels at those points
against 262,000 bushels a year ago as cause
for alarm, brought about the only period of
strength in what strength the market ex
hibited. May advanced to $1 15%@1 16%.
The improvement was not long sustained. In
the absence of any demand from the shorts
whose wants were soon satisfied, May re
acted closing easy at $1 14%<g>i 14%.
Corn during moat of the session was dull
with prices fairly steady at about the open
ing range, 44% to 44%Â©, which was %c to
i%c under the previous close. May sold at
44%C48<\ receding, however, at the close to '
44%#44%Â«.
Oats ruled extremely dull, but held steady
on a slight decline. The opening was a
shade down for May at 80%e, and the market
closed steady at 89% c.
Provisions were firm for the whole list.
Outsiders and grain traders led the buying.
May pork showed a gain at the close of 10Â®

Potatoes. Onions and Vegetables.
The general tone of the Potato market Is
one of firmness, the daily receipts of prime
Burbanks being light and such stock passes
out of receivers' hands almost immediately
upon arrival. River Burbanks are arriving
freely, but most of them are coming In to a
few dealers who control the market lor that
line of goods and prices are well maintained.
Onions and Sweet Potatoes are firm at the
recently advanced prices.
Receipts of southern vegetables were light,
â¢i usual on. Tuesday, and fresh offerings of
most descriptions did better. Offerings of
Wax Beans consisted wholly of carried-over
stock of poor quality, which was hard to sell
at any price. Some Rhubarb came in from
across the bay and sold at 7c per pound.

Poultry and Game.
The Poultry' market was slenderly supplied
and firm under a steady call for all descrip
tions, particularly large young chickens, and
Hens, Fryers and live Turkeys were quoted
higher. The day's receipts of domestic stock
were only 36 coops and there was no Western
received. All Indications point to a firm mar
ket for the balance of the week, as it is ex
pected that the receipts from the West will
be light and the storm will hold back shipments
from domestic points. Game was in demand,
owing to the scarcity of Poultry, and some
kinds of Wild Ducks were higher.

Butter, Oieese and Eggs.
There were very few boxes of Butter In San
Francisco yesterday. For several days quite a
small fleet of boats with supplies has been
trying to reach this port, but all have been
delayed by rough weather, and as the brisk
local and outside shipping demand has cleaned
up the market, as already mentioned, the result
ir no Butter left. Under mese circumstances
quotations are of course nominal. The situa
tion yesterday was, not what the receiver could
get, but what he chose to force the buyer to
pay. If he wanted to squeeze him into paying
an advance of 2 or 3 cents he could easily do
so. Most of the merchants, however, chose to
be moderate In their asking prices and keep
their regular patrons good natured.
Eggs were steady, as the storm cut down
the receipts, and store descriptions were firm,
being wanted for shipment..
There Whs no change in Cheese, but the
market was dull and not oversteady.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits. â  !
The heavy rainfall restricted trade In fresh !
fruits yesterday, and dealers who were In
clined to purchase freely* of Oranges and other
Citrus fruits on the preceding day were holding
off, waiting for the weather to clear up. Stocks
of everything In the Citrus line were ample
and all kinds stood as previously quoted, for
the reason that there was not sufficient busi
ness to warrant any change. Four or Aye cars
of Oranges will be auctioned to-day. Stocks :
of Apples were Increased Dy 3 carloads, and
that description ruled weak, with large lines
unsold. Prices were no lower, aa nearly all of
the offerings were bought at high prices up north,
which necessitates the asking of correspond
ingly high prices here. Large buyers experi
ence no difficulty in shading the quotations, i
however. Bananas are abundant and weak.
It is estimated that there are nearly 20,000
bunches, rapidly maturing, in the cellars.

LOVE LETTERS LEAD TO A TRAGEDY
Young Man Kills
Woman and
Himself.
Double Crime Is
Caused Btj
Jealousy.
On discovering that the woman with
whom he had lived was playing him
false and owing to the slow but sure
encroachments of poverty, Edward C.
Tidcombe, member of a prominent
Portland, Ore., family, shot and killed
Mrs. Georgia Nelson, whom he
was supposed to have married
four months ago under the alias
of E. L. Jameson. Tidcombe
then sent a bullet into his brain and
lingered for several hours before death
ended his suffering. The tragedy took
place at 945 Stanyan street at an early
hour yesterday morning, but nothing
was known of its startling details until
nearly noon.
S. Richmond, from whom Tidcombe,
under the name of E. L. Jameson,
rented apartments, was summoned to
the telephone yesterday morning by a
woman who asked for the Jamesons.
Richmond knocked at the door of the
Jamesons' room but received no re
sponse. At 11 o'clock the woman again
telephoned and Richmond made a sec
ond attempt to arouse the roomers.
Becoming suspicious he looked through
the keyhole and saw Tidcombe lying on
the bed, his head resting on a blood
stained pillow.
The landlord notified the police of
the Park Police Station. Corporal
Rainsbury responded and decided that
it was best to force the lock to the
Jamesons' room. This was done and
the apartments opened just as Captain
of Police Gleeson arrived. The In
vestigators found the woman dead in
â¢ bed and the man lying by her side
with a bullet in his brain. Mrs. Nelson,
or Jameson, as she was known in the
house, had been shot Â«Â»ack of
the left ear and was almost
instantly killed. From the posi
tion of her body it would appear
that the shot was fired while she slept.
Tidcombe had a wound under the right
ear, the bullet penetrating the brain.
He was still breathing. The ambulance
was summoned and the wounded man
was taken to the Park Emergency Hos
pital, where he died at 7:30 last night.
CAUSE A MYSTERY.
The mystery in the tragedy lies in the
fact that the desperate deed appeared
wholly unpremeditated. Tidcombe,
upon retiring Monday night, had care
fully placed his trousers under his pil
low for the purpose of pressing them,
where they were found In zhe morning
wet with blood.
The floor was strewn with letters ad
dressed to the woman from many male

admirers. Tidcombe evidently had been
reading these letters.
It would seem that Tidcombe awoke
during the night, and after brooding
over his discovery of the perfidy of the
woman, or, perhaps, his financial trou
bles, decided to end her life and his.
He went Into the rear room and got
two revolvers. Both were of 32-caliber,
one with the barrel sawed off. Select
ing the long-barreled pistol he returned
to the front room and did the deed.
When the police broke in the door they
found the revolver on the man's body,
while on the breast of the dead woman
rested a pet kitten, purring softly.
No line was left by Tidcombe to show
cause for his act, although a memo
randum book showed that the pair
were hard pressed for money. Among
his effects were letters showing that
he had been employed in this city by
J. K. Armsby & Co. and by Moise,
Klinkner & Co. since May, 1904, coming
to the latter firm from Portland, Ore.,
under the name of Jameson. He bore
a good reputation with both firms, and
was discharged from the former after
the holidays were over.
Tidcombe formerly lived with
his mother in Portland at 700
Thurman street and it had
been arranged that she should
come to this city to live. He was a
graduate of the Portland High School.
Tidcombe was about 25 years old and
magnificently developed physically.
Two of his sisters live in Oakland.
MAKES STRANGE STATEMENT.
Yesterday afternoon an unknown
man telephoned to the Coroner's of
fice and said that he was acquainted
with Tidcombe, who left Portland a
year ago under the name of Edwards
owing to financial troubles there; He
alleged that Tidcombe went to Hono
lulu and the Samoan Islands and that
upon his return he went to St. Louis,
where he met Mrs. Nelson.
Mrs. Georgia Nelson was the di
vorced wife of Frank D. Nelson, a
salesman for H. N. Martin & Co., a
tobacco firm of Louisville, Ky. Prior
to her marriage she was Miss Georgia
Mabry of Vandalia, 111. She was of
slight build and pleasing countenance
and appeared to be about 28 years old.
Among the 'satchelful of letters
were communications from her hus
band accusing her of improper con
duct in Los Angeles and begging her
to be faithful to him while he was
away from her. There are several
letters from a prominent business man
of Seattle offering her money and ask
ing her to come to him or let him go
to her. Other letters are from a
woman friend, who is a nurse in this
city. One of these letters congratu
lates Mrs. Nelson on capturing the
Seattle man and expresses the hope
that she "will soak him good."
Mrs. Jean Willering of 1067 Oak
street, Oakland, a sister of the dead,
woman, called at the Coroner's office
yesterday afternoon and while being
shown the pictures and elTects of Mrs.
Nelson attempted to secrete the letters
and pictures In her dress. She was
prevented from doing so by Deputy
Coroner Meehan.
WELL KNOWN IN PORTLAND.
Tidcombe Is of Good Family, but Has
Bad Record.
PORTLAND, Jan. 24.âEdward C.
Tidcombe was a well-known young
man here. He comes of a good family
and had been Hying with his parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Charles Tidcombe, at 700
Thurman street. He was a graduate
of high school and a member of Mult
nomah Athletic Club. He was a foot
' ball player, a runner and weight
J thrower. His best success was as half
( back on the football team of the high
â  school.
There was considerable scandal at
the time of his â¢ disappearance from
here four months ago. He had been
employed as bookkeeper for the Tbke
Point Oyster Company and embezzled
a considerable quantity of money. He
j was a poker player and lost heavily.
I All last summer he is said to have lost
j regularly. It is not known how deep
-1 ly he was indebted to his employers, as
1 they have never made â¢ a very deter
j mined effort to locate him.
1 When he left It was supposed that
jhe had gone to. Mexico. But within a
few weeks a number of Portland peo
-1 pie had met him in San Francisco,
where he had been living under
an assumed name. Whenever seen by
Portland people he was with a wom
an whom he introduced as "Miss"
Nelson, who wÂ»s supposed to have
eloped from Portland with him when
he left. Whether he was married to
the woman or not Is not known,
though his mother heard indirectly
that he had been married.
The news of the tragedy came as a
8 hock to Mrs. Tidcombe. She had ex
pected, to visit her son in about two
weeks.

AUDITOR BAEHR WINS BET
FROM TREASURER McDOUGALD
Draws Down Wager by Signing More
Municipal Bonjls in an Hour
Than His Associate.
Auditor Baehr yesterday won a $5
: hat from City Treasurer McDougald
;as the result of a wager made as to
j which of the two city officials could
j sign the greater number of municipal
: bonds within one hour's time. Baehr
! and McDougald, together with Mayor
!St hmitz arid Supervisors' Clerk Fay,
have been busily engaged in the task
for several days past. The first named
two were returning from lunch when
McDougald began to brag about the
number of bonds he had signed the
day before.
"I'll bet .1 signed more than any
other official," said McDougald.
"I'll bet that I can sign more in an
hour than you can," retorted Baehr.
"Done for a $5 hat," replied Mc-
Dougald.
Timekeepers were appointed and the
i two officials began operations. At the
I end of the hour Baehr had signed exact
j ly 500 bonds, while McDougald had af
; fbed his signature to 497. McDougald
paid the bet like a little man, but
claims that he lost because his name
contains more letters than that of
Baehr.

DEMINGS' NOTES

Some Want Eppinger Grain
Identified, While Others
Demand Pro Rata Division
BOOK CAUSES FLURRY
Memoranda Showing Loca
tion of Wheat and Barley
a Problem for Attorneys
James Demings and his notebook
were the peak about which the storm
of conflicting claims for the remnant
of the Eppingers' grain assets gath
ered yesterday in Judge Murasky's
court. The lean little keeper of the
Crockett warehouse records had made
notes highly gratifying to some of the
banks which make claim to* specific
lots of wheat and barley as security
for their loans to the bankrupts and
disheartening to those who are plead
ing for a distribution of a pro rata
share of the value of the 3600 tons of
grain remaining after the Eppinger
failure as collateral for some $700,
--000 advanced.
Demings was on the stand all morn
ing. He was permitted to refresh his
memory from a notebook containing
entries he had made from copies of
statements rendered to the Eppingers
regarding grain in the warehouse at
the time of the failure. Before he
had finished the dozen or more attor
neys, representing as many interests,
were in an uproar, some demanding
the exclusion of the evidence and
some insisting upon its admission.
When Attorney Freidenrich, for the
International Banking Corporation,
took the witness in hand he an
nounced his purpose of discrediting
both witness and book. He drew out
that Demings, after making his notes,
had placed the book in charge of his
wife and had lost it about the time of
the giving of his deposition in Janu
ary of last year. Later the book was
found, how he did not know, and it
was compared with a statement pre
pared by Attorney Chickerlng, repre
senting the American National Bank,
which demands certain specific lots of
grain. Judge Murasky thought the
witness might refresh his memory
from the book, but was in doubt as to
its admission in evidence in support of
various facts by the entries made.
The American National is anxious
for the book to be admitted. It holds
that six lots of grain are identified as
its own securities, making about 25
per cent of its total claim. Other
banks claiming specific lots are the
Bank of Stockton, Wells, Fargo & Co.
and Blum & Co. Among those liable
to lose if the specific lots are identified
are the Nevada National, the Londqn,
Paris and American, the International
Banking Corporation and the San
Francisco Savings Union. These and
others want a pro rata division of the
grain. They contend that while Dem
ings' book shows certain lots In their
right places In the warehouse the
original grain in the lots was taken
out and shipped or graded and re
placed by other grain, which the
holders of the warehouse receipts
have no right to claim.
Judge Murasky has admitted the
cross-complaint of Trustee Henry
Wadsworth, claiming the grain for
the benefit of all the Eppinger cred
itors. The hearing will be resumed
this morning.

ARGUES THAT ORDINANCE
IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL
Judge Cook Will Render Decision on
Applications for Habeas Corpus
Writs on January 30.
The seventy-nine women arrested at
620 Jackson street and 1129 Dupont
street during the raids of the Grand
Jury and deputy sheriffs filed into
Judge Cook's courtroom yesterday af
ternoon and listened to the arguments
of counsel on the applications for
writs of habeas corpus for their re
lease from custody.
Attorney Ach, for the petitioners,
argued that the ordinance passed on
December 12, under which the women
were arrested, is unconstitutional be
cause it interferes with the individual
rights of the people. He gave defini
tions of the words "visitor" and "in
mate" and argued that a physician,
grocer, plumber or any one who had
legitimate business at a house of ill
fame could be arrested under the or
dinance.
District Attorney Byington and As
sistant District Attorney Harris re
plied, and the Judge said he would
render his decision on January 30.
SLAVE RELATES
HER SAD STORY
Leung Ah Duck Testifies
Strongly Against Lee Toy
and Interpreter Da Silva
BEATEN ON BOARD SHIP
Tells How She Was Coached
in Hongkong and on the
Steamer by Her Tormentor
Leung Ah Duck told a story yester
day-on the witness stand in the United
States District Court implicating Lee
Toy, a wealthy resident of Phila
delphia, and Hlppolyttus da Silva,
formerly interpreter in the Chinese
Bureau, in the business of importing
Chinese women to this country for Im
moral purposes. The accused men were
being tried before a Jury on an indict
ment presented several months ago.
Through Dr. John Endlcott Gardner, a
bureau interpreter, Leung told the Jury
about an eventful episode in her his
tory. She was a slave girl, and was
released by her mistress to a Chinese
man who turned her over to Lee Toy
in Hongkong for the purpose of being
taken to the St. Louis Exposition. She
told how she had been coached by Lee
Toy and Da Silva to say to the Immi
grant officials on her arrival here that
she was going to the exposition to act
as a waitress in the tea garden. Lee
Toy, she said, also told her the real
purpose for which she was being taken
to the United States, and warned her
not to let the immigrant officials know
anything about it. On board ship she
was also coached b.v Da Silva, and
when she ventured to remonstrate Da
Silva beat her. Lee Toy was present,
she said, when Da Silva beat her, and
Lee Toy remarked, "You haven't been
beaten enough; you must be beaten
some more."
The woman added that when she ar
rived here she told the coached story
to the Chinese Bureau officials, but re
fused to swear to it.
During the testimony of the woman
numerous objections on technical
grounds were made by Bert Schlesinger
and Samuel M. Shortridge, counsel for
Lee Toy, and Thomas C. West for Da
Silva, but Judge de Haven brushed
aside all technicalities and directed that
the woman should be permitted to tell
her story in her own way. Then Mr.
Schlesinger took the almond eyed lady
In hand for cross-examination.
"You never Intended to come to this
country for an immoral purpose, did
you?" he asked.
"No," was the reply. "I told Lee Toy
on the steamer that I never would lead
an immoral life."
She said further that Lee Toy had
threatened to hang her should she re
fuse to testify to the coached story.
The witness was still on the stand
when the court took an adjournment
until this morning. The case Is handled
for the prosecution by Ben L. McKin
ley, Assistant United States Attorney,
the evidence having been gathered
by George W. Hazen, United States
Secret Service Agent.
, Three other slave girls in custody of
Miss Davis of the Chinese Mission will

INSINUATIONS
DISPLEASING
Executor Bridgford Takes
Exceptions to Questions
Asked by A. J. Clunie
The plasters on the Clunie-Briogford- :
White wounds were pulled off again j
yesterday, and the soreness re-ex- i
hibited to the critical eye of Judge
Coffey. Andrew J. Clunle, half j
brother of the late Thomas J. Clunle,
and one of the three executors of his
will, in pursuance of the examination
in the matter of his objections to the
account of administration rendered by
E. A. Bridgford and Burrell G. White,
the two other executors, had the former
in range of the fire of his questions for
most of the afternoon, then fired a few
scattering volleys at Whiter
During the examination of Bridgford,
Clunie demanded an exhibition of the
witness' private account at the Western
National Bank, of which Bridford Is a
director. Clunie said his purpose was
to show that Bridgford and Judge
Grant had divided the $8000 attorneys'
fee allowed to Grant by White and
Bridgford, for legal services rendered.
Bridgford declined to produce his
private account, and the court sus
tained him. In the course of the per
sonalities which followed Clunie said:
"You have been holding my money
away from me and using it for your-
Belf, and you have been using the
money of others in the same way."
Judge Bridgford paled, but restrained
himself, and a moment later he said,
"I am tired of your insinuations."
Whereupon Judge Coffey interrupted
with "I can try this case without refer
ence to these personal matters."
Clunie proceeded to examine Bridg
ford upon the matter of Grant's em
ployment, and asked as a matter of
fact whether the Woodland Judge had
not been employed before there was
any contest, and whether Mrs. Clunie
had never really made a contest, but
had simply asked for a postponement
of her proposed claim for community
property in lieu of taking under the
will. He also asked whether Mrs.
Clunie's father, in her behalf, had not
first offered to settle for $50,000 and
then for $25,000, which Bridgford ad
mitted; but he declared that the pro
posed settlement was interrupted be
cause Andrew Clunle new Into a pas
sion when asked to sign an agreement
that he would not contest the guardian
ship of Jack Clunie. Here Clunie asked j
whether he had not prayed, almost on
his knees, for Bridgford to settle Mrs. j
Clunie's contest.
Bridgford, satirically, said, "If you I
went on your knees there would be |
holes in your pants to show for it."
Clunie retorted, "No, I am not In the j
habit of praying, or passing the plate, 1
like you."
White's examination as to the em- :
ployment of extra attorneys brought |
out nothing new excepting that Walter j
Robertson asked for $3500 before ac- ;
ceptlng $2000 for his services.
