FIFE OF A TRAMP
MISSING INSURANCE MAN IS FmNID
W saro" Stanyau, not long BSO a
prosperous insurance man of
thfa city, but who disappeared
boob after marrying a woman
who already t l>ad a husband,
has been found. He Is lying In
the County Jail of San Bernar
dino County* bring: held as a
witness to the murder of Fred
Hldridge, a peddler, which oc
curred tn the mountains near
that place. He Is ragged and
unkempt and bears the appear
ance of a hobo. His story of
his wanderings since he left
San Francisco shows that
much of the time he has led
the life of a tramp, and has
tried to drown the past in al
cohol. He gave his name when
taken Into custody as Samuel
J&ckson. His identity wns^ dis
covered through a letter he
wrote to a friend here. He
' says domestic troubles caused
his flight.
Held in a Prison
Under the Name
of Jackson.
Admits Seeing Mur

"Sam" Stanyan is in a cell of the Coun
ty Jail at San Bernardino." The" mystery
furrounding the sudden disappearance of
this well-known San '\u25a0' Francisco . broker,
who left his home and~nEWly '; wedded wife
on March 30 of last year and who had
never been heard of here again until yes
terday, is completely cleared up. A tele
gram to The Call from San Bernardino '
proves without a doubt that a man shab
bily dressed and jailed at San Bernar
dino to be held as a witness is Stanyan.
Samuel Stanyan is held in San Bernar
dino under the name of Samuel Jackson
as a witness, he having admitted seeing
the murder of Ernest Homo In the moun
tains on September 6, Fred Eldridge,
Romo's partner, being accused of the
crime.
Stanyan is dressed like a common tramp
and he was arrested with a crowd of
drunken acquaintances. Unlike in former
years, when he appeared in his office
dressed in clothes of the latest cut, dia
monds adorning his fingers and a general
air of prosperity about him. Stanyan is
now merely a weary hobo, one of the
great class which works a little , and
trends the rest of the time In Idleness.
Stanyan, or Jackson, as he now calls
himself, made the confession to Sheriff
Ralphs of San Bernardino after a vigor
ous sweating process. Stanyan â¢ stated
that he was returning with Eldridge from
their work on the Arrowhead reservoir
end that the murder was committed
after a quarrel between Eldridge and
Romo, the former firing a shot from; his
revolver with deadly effect. :
LETTER PROVES IDENTITY. -
The evidence that Stanyan was in San
Bernardino under an assumed name came
In a letter addressed to a friend in tUia
city and signed "Samuel Jackson." It
was rtctived at the San Francisco post
tfiice yesterday and furnished the ne^es :
cary link In the chain of evidence .which
piovesthe man's identity. The story- is
cr.e of a reckless life of dissipation wnich
Etanyan has led 6<nce his flight from San
Francisco last year.
ThÂ© friend to whom the letter was ad
dressed claims to have been a companion
cf Stanyan. or "Jackson." as he was
known then, when the two were touring
Southern California on foot. They were
close partners and worked and rested al
ternately, drinking heavily, all the time.
One night Stanyan 'confessed his Identity
to bis friend, and said he was once a
prosperous business man of San Fran
cisco.
Then the friend left and he heard noth
ing more of ' Stanyan until; yesterday, >
when the letter reached him". The .en
velope was taken at once to the German
Insurance Company, where Stanyan was
formerly employed, and ' the writing was
compared with the entries which Stanyan
had made in the books there.
When C. H. Ward, the manager of the
company, saw the writing, he unhesitat
ingly declared that It was ; the ! work , of
his former employe. Then, on closer com
parison with the writings made â¢ in . the
books, he said that it resembled Stanyan's
writing in every way, exoCpt that it was
a little too regular.
DO3IKSTIC TROUIILES.
The story of the life of "Sam" Stanyan,
as he was familiarly called byl many of
his business associates, is a highly In- ;
teresting one. So . successful was 1 he , In
the Insurance. business that he was re
garded us a "man of exceptional ability,
lie was trusted by all.
..ien he was married. Ills wife was
Miss Marie Knittel, -of San Rafael; Con
siderable notoriety was caused 2 at the
time of the wedding because oi.thesfact
that the bride was already married âto
Henry C. Schmidt, son of. the Danish Co
nsul at Honolulu, and "she had left him
without having, secured a divorce.-. Later I
the decree was secured and the affair was â¢
passrd over. / At the time the woman was j

BARON KOMURA
NOT IN DANGER
Passes a Comfortable Day
and Physicians Do Not
Expect a Serious Crisis
NEW YORK, Sept. 13.â Baron Komura,
the Japanese' peace envoy, who 1 was re
ported to-day to be suffering from typhoid
fever, although the consulting physicians
are not a unit on this point, was said to
be in a satisfactory condition. Baron
Komura is at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel,
and his return^ to Japan has been indefi
nitely postponed, although most of the

President Roosevelt, reached the hotel
to-day. Flowers and cards have been left
by many friends.
To-night Mr. Sato, spokesman for the
Japanese party, issued the following
statement:
Drs. Delafleld. Bremer and Pritcharti saw
Baron Komura in consultation at 6p. m. They
announce the Baron's condition to be favorable,
no new symptoms having oeveloped, and the
l>atlent having passed a very comfortable day.
They are unanimous In the opinion that the
liaron's - condition Indicates nothing alarming^
or serious at present.
Continuing Mr. Sato said that the phy
sicians were not sure that. the Baron had
typhoid fever, and that he might' be suf
fering from complications from gall
stones. Two nurses are in constant at
tendance. â¢â¢\u25a0.\u25a0
Among those who called to inquire after
Baron Komura to-night was tÃaront Baron

hira. . '
Mr. Takahira will go to Washington to
morrow on business^ He will remain
there unless there is a serious turn in
Baron Komura's condition." \
A cablegram was received during the
day from Baroness Komura inquiring as
to her husband's condition. The Japanese
were much pleased at the receipt of the
cablegram, as dispatches had been re
ceived in this city reporting the Baroness
and her children to have been murdered.

PARTRIDGE WILL GROW.
It is the judgment of citizens generally
that the candidacy of John S. Partridge
will grow in strength and popular favor
as the campaign progresses. He is. not
lacking, in ability, energy or character.
The chief objection urged against him is
his youth, but objection on this score
will surely bring to his support thousands
of young men who maintain that one
who has attained the age of S5 years is no
longer in the Juvenile class.
There are many Incidents in the career
of llr. Partridge that remind one , of the
early struggles of men who have achieved
a lasting place in American history.
Partridge as a boy worked for money to
educate himself. He supplemented the
knowledge gained In the common ' schools
with a full course in the University of
California. He jworked in a country
newspaper" office mnd later on- taught
Latin and mathematics in the San Fran
cisco public schools to acquire : means to
enable him to pursue the studies, of; law.
The young men who knew him when be
v.as struggling to make a place for him
se!f amons the leaders of men are fore
most in their estimates of his strength of
character and firmness of purpose.
Partridge very nearly approaches the
standard of the ideal citizen. He is not a
seeker of office in any- sense of the word.
Two years ago he declined the nomina
tion for District Attorney tp accept the
first place under the City Attorney, know-*
ing that the work which be was engaging
to perform .was arduous and that the
compensation was not great. The oppor-.
iurÂ»ity to become familiar with the spirit
end purpose of the new charter for the
government of San Francisco * has not
i;..en neglected by the Republican nominee
for 2dayor.
" The story comes from the San Fran
i-ixco Republican League that Partridge
..at- tiiken completely by surprise when
'..:â¢.Â« suggestion, was /made that he
>:l-.ould get Jnto tlie contest as a candi
date for Mayor. He, declined, giving
;;s v reason for his declination, obliga
â¢jons de\-olving upon him to provide
n.t.ans for assisting in the support "of
iiis mother and sister.- He was assured
t!iat the League would not expect; him 1
to make a money spending. fight." ;-. *
It is said that some of the old found
ers of the political push had hopes that
an easy millionaire would '.be'ehosen to
head the ticket and consequently, they;
disappointed and (distressed. If Mr/
fa I J artrld ge had a': million * to " hoard . and
somethingr. besides throw/out, the
millionaires would^ know -him "better^
and the push exalt him higher.* About
all that can be said against him snow
Is that he Is neither old or rich,* but it
may be reserved for him, In -the full-

mons has passed from their hands.
Three venlfemen were examined this
morning and dismissed, Tletjens betas tha
f onrth. William E. Boyd. a blacksmith,
was . not on the assessment roll, '. which
disqualified him. E. J. Flgg.'a merchant,
had been introduced at one time to con
vict Bunkers, and he was not wanted by
the defense. Bunkers' present enmity to
his associates in bribery being too well
known to permit the defense taking any
chances with a Juryman that even knew
him by sight. Albert F. Williams was
challenged by the prosecution because he
.said that he would reject the testimony
of a self-confessed ' perjurer, as Bunkers
Is said to be.
But finally Tietjens was called to thÂ©
box. He had formed no opinion as to
the 'merits of the case, he had never
served as a juror and he knew \u25a0 nothing
of law. He agreed to accept the direc
tions of the court, however, and. was
accepted by both sides. After he was
swoia the jury was placed In the custody
of the Sheriff and an adjournment until
1:30, o'clock was taken. H. I* Partridge
was announced as associate counsel" for
the 'defense,' and during the day he wa3
in constant consultation with Johnson. .

DEBATE ON
RAILROADS
Messrs. Sproule and WTieeler
Argue on the Question of
Government Control of
Bates in Transportation
EXCESSIVE TAEIFF
- OX PACIFIC COAST
Interstate Commerce Com
mittee Admits That the
Laws Governing Prices
on Freight Are Strict
There was a debate before the Com
monwealth Club last evening In the Ma
pie room of the Palace Hotel between
William Sproule and William R. Wheeler
on "(Jrovernment Control of , Railroad
Rates." Mr. Weinstock of Weinstock &
Lubin presided. -
â¢ During his argument Wheeler eaid in
part: \u25a0.
The Â«reat Issue now raised by the peopW
against raUways is that interstate railroad
rites sbaii be not only â¢ reasonable â¢in them
selves, but relatively reasonable and Just as
compared \u25a0with rates allowed to other 'persons
and other places, and that~"all unreasonable
or unjust ccarces ehall be subject upon com
plaint to summary regulation by the Inter
etaie Commerce Commission. Jt ought to be
sufficient to say that the commission cannot
now correct a rate tor the future, and, if 'it
could, the rate so corrected cannot be enforced
lit tftne to eerve any useful purpose. The
recult is that the people are -without ar.y
. adequate or available remedies, and the rail-
T.ays are practically, free to charge then
patrons what ihey pleaec and as much as
they please tor the public services they render.
Here is a case in iÂ»oint. Rales on mer
chandise from i^an Francisco and L.:>s Angeles
to towns in Arizona and New Mexico art
much higher per mile than trom Chicago and
ft. Louis. This gives the Middle West cities
an undue advantage over the California cities
in competing for the trade of these towns.
In other words, the California merchants are
rot given the lull benents of their contiguity
to the markets in question, in consequence
of which much of thip trade is diverted to
the. Middle West, while at as equal rate pet
mile more of the business would go to our
merchants. Thip-ig. in effect, plainly a dis
erimlnaUoa between localities, fax-oring as It
dots the distributors of. the Middle West ajs
against thoee of California. The matter has
bten brought to the attention of the traffic
officials of both roads serving these territories
and readjustment declined. While confident
that w e have a good case, we shrink from
bringing It before the commission for the rea
son that we do not care to engage In a long
winded law suit.' ev#n if pacctssful in the end
and no cne knows this better than our rail- :
road friende. If the processes of the - law
such that: we could be sure of a final
adjudication within a year an action would
be commenced, but merchants object to deal
ing in futures of four years and possibly
s-cven.
The evil consequences of an unjust or un
reasonable freight charge are entailed from
the moment that the rate is put Into effect by a
tariff sheet. -It hampers or prevents business
contracts, and when taxen Into account In
affected commercial transactions, as H must be,
the extortion or injustice rails . upon the' pro
ducer, dealer, shipper or consignee and . the
consumer. â¢ whether applied on a shipment or
not. the mar. who made that raie made It for
a service which his railroad only can render,
tnd in makin* that rate he assumed to regu
late part of the commerce of the United States.
The opponents of the proposed legislation- say
that that man's action *nould be final, except
lor the valueless remedy of-Â£uing for-repara
tion, which they benevolently accord and hold
vp as a thlning mark of fairness to the public
view. The advocates of the proposed legisla
tion demand that the Govwament shall exer
cise its power of revision over that man's
actions, to the cad that unjust and unreasonable
rates shall be corrected. The people of the
T.'nited States are demanding to-day that their
products be transported at fair rates and
â¢without discrimination, and they, consider the
jiÃht to reparation in particular cases as' futile
end barren. Give us a tribunal, they say,
that shall have the power Â»:ot only to try and
edjurtfre whe-thpr a specirc rate made by the
roads is jest or unjust, but also, after invesii
sation. to name what Is the reasonable rate
lor the future.
It should be remembered always that thÂ«
)->rr-eent effort to amend me Interstate com--
niTce law is to make effective ite first three
sections :
1. That rates shall be reasonable and \u25a0 just,
2. That the EarnÂ« rate shall be charged tor
like services.
3. That there shall be no wrongful prefer
ence' or prejudice in rates or facilities as be
tween persons, places or commodities.
Mr. Sproule's argument was partly as
follows:
The proposition that the Interstate Com
merce Commission hjp clothed with power to
revise existing rates as in their judgment
from time to time deemed advisable upon
hearing is, in the public mind, very generally
confused with quite a different question, name
ly, the prevention of rebates, personal Â«r cor
l>orate- discrimination an* other illegal prac
tices in manipulation of published rates.
It is not the suppreslon or rebates that la
the- issue, on, the. use- of rates not published
according to law. or wenton discrimination
between persons cr localities, or other prac
tices of that cliaracter, ror these are already
amply provided against by tne interstate com
merce act. supported by the Elkins bill, as
any one who takes the -trouble to read thÂ«m
can readily discern. These laws are brief
Enough for all .-to read and clear Â«nough for
all to understand . -with respect to thes^ spe
cific matters. As to.them Â«ie railroads make
no issue, but, on the contrary, welcome strong
public sentiment â¢ against these things, for If
the chippor, the merchant and the community
individually and collectively stand with the
railroads against such practices they must
cease. It is not only competition between
railroads, it ie also competition between ehlp-
I-<-rs and between communities which has" pro
duced such practices, ana ror them the rail- '
roads do not bear the blame alone.
It Is proper to cay that at no time in the
history of the United States - have its trans
portation interests been so free as they are
10-day Irom practices of this character, and Its
commercial life bo unrestrained by unfair dis
criminations. The laws upon this subject arÂ«
as strict a*. they can be made; indeed the In
terstate Commerce Commission Itself has con
ceded that. Tet It is surprising how many
harbor the misapprehension that the proposed
echemes of rate regulation ore for the pur
pose of preventing the practices alluded to.
They quite forget the fact that it is one thing.'
to make a rate, another thing to maintain the
rate when made. It is just as easy Illicitly
to cut a rate made by the Interstate Com
merce Commission as it is to cut one made by
the (reneral freight agent of any single road.
It is generally conceded that the effort to
maintain rates through segisiation has been*
generally successful.
I understand that in . the discussion " before
the club this evening the place I have be<!n- ;
ajsigned Is thai in efforts at rate regulation
the Interstate Commerce Commission should
not be clcthed with power to revise existing
j rates ac in their Judgment from time to lime
deemed advisable upon hearing, such revision
to take effect whenever the commission so
decides. - \u25a0 ; ,
As my \u25a0 personal convictions coincide with
the side of the subject thÂ« club has allotted
me I will proceed accordingly.'
Tou will please bear In mind to beg-in with
that revision of an established rate â¢is JuEt
at much an act of rate-making as was the
making of the rate when It was originally
established. The making of the original rate
to cover a given service on a given com
modity between two places and the act pf
revision of that rate by substituting anothei
one for It require each the same power and
equal Initiative. The power to revise a rate
lÂ» Vie power to fix a rate. \u25a0 . .',
. Under cur political system It is not hard
to conceive political questions arising under
which; tne Interstate. Commerce 'Commission
. might become a controlling factor In a po
litical, campaign through the exercise ;by -a
Icrceful President of his . own - convictions In
teneral rate reduction or adjustment by ex
ecutive pressure apon the commission. , This
effort tnight' be. conceived and the pressure
exerted alike In, the Â«plrlt of altruistic patriot
ism or of patriotic Apolitical necessity, but In
â¢ ether ease . -would ; amount to seizure of the
railroad revenues 'and ' Impairment, of their

RICH MAN'S

HIS SANITY m DOUBT
Father Says Odd Actions
Have Led to Suspicion
of Grave Mental Troubles
Mrs. Bertha Stormer, 442 Golden Gate
avenue, after a night's reflection, be
came convinced that * Philip D. Wheat
land, the millionaire Bostonian's son,
was the man who called at her home
on August IS last, year to.' bus'" some
furniture which she had advertised for
sale and stole her purse*containingr $60.
She swore to a complaint before Po
lice Judge Conlan, charging \Vhcatland
with grand larceny, and he was bool?fed
-at the City Prison 6n the charge. The
Judge fixed his bonds in $2000 or $1000
cash. ,: â¢ V . ' \u25a0 ;. .
Wheatland's trial for petty larceny,
for stealing $10 from the pockeÂ»-book
of Mrs. Riria A. Fink, 2406 California
street, on Monday, was to have been
continued before Judge Conlan yester
day, oui at. me request of, his attorney,
Alf. Wheelan, a continuance was
granted till September 19. Mrs. Healy,
1911 Polk street, was in court to testi
fy that she had never authorized
Wheatland to buy furniture for her,
but she was excused till September 19.
Captain Reynolds is inclined to be
lieve with Wheatland's friends that
over-indulgence in liquor has bade him
irresponsible for his actions. His man :
ncr In court would also lead" to that
belief. He does not take the
interest in the proceedings and seems
to have no conception of the disgrace
he has brought upon himself and fam
ily. Several friends called to see him
in prison yesterday. â¢
BOSTON, Mase., Sept. 13.â "1 do not
bflleve Philip has done the things that
have been charged against him,'' eaid
George Wheatland, father of P. D.
Wheatland, under arrest in San Francisco
for larceny. "He has done some foolish
things, so many that there is grave doubt
In all our minds as to his mental re
sponsibility, but he wouldn't steal. There
was no need of his .doing so. Each week
ne has been sent money- by me; in fact,
I sent a remittance only yesterday. He
has had ample funds for his needs ever
since he went West. -:â¢
"We have wanted him to come home,
but he would not come, and there has been
no way that we could compel him to, so
we have continued to send him money
for himself and his wife. This thing will
come harder on Ills mother than on*any
one else."
Wheatland was, while in this city, a
member of the Somerset and Puritan
clubs. He is a son oÂ«. General George
Wheatland. He was a~ devotee of yacht
ing, owning a forty-foot racing
sailed in a number of races.

AFTER VACCINATION.
Elmore Wise's Death Is Puzzling
to Physicians of Oakland.
OAKLAND BOY WHO DIED "OF LOCKJAW.' WHICH IS BELIEVED TO HAVE !
DEVELOPED FJ:OM VACCINATION. .THE ATTENDING PHYSICIAN AND
THE IIT.ALTH OFFICER ARE MUCH PUZZLED OVER THE CASE.
OAKLAND.- Sept. 13.â Lockjaw, . pro
duced by infection of a vaccination sore,
caused the death last night after five
days of suffering of little Elmore T. Wise,
7 years old. the son of Mr. and Mrs.
Charles W. Wise, residing at 361 Fifth
street.
In accordance with the provisions of the
compulsory vaccination law. the boy, a
pupil at the Lincoln School, was vac
cinated on Aueust~l4 by Dr. I* F. Her
rick. The child was carefully watched,
the scalpel wound being dressed daily
and all of the physician's directions were
followed. It was not until September 7
that the symptoms cf tetanus were mani
fested. Dr. Hcrrick was called and took
charge of the case, but was unable to
check the progrccs of the deadly infec
tion. All that could be done was to alle
viate as far as possible the sufferings of |
the afflicted boy.
The case was reported to-day to Health .j
Officer Dr. E. N. Ewer, who said his;
opinion was that the death was not di-.l
rectly due to the vaccinationâ that If the
virus u K ed had been infected the trouble
would have appeared in from five to ten
days after vaccination. In this case Dr.
Ewer pointed out- that there, must have
been some failure to observe the rules of !
the Board of Health, which provide for a
daily antiseptic dressing of the wound
ajid the exercise of the jrreatest care to
prevent the scratching of the injury. Dr.
Ewer added:
If thig Infection. Â» ere the dimrt.rwilt of
the operation the patient would , have nuc
cuÂ»b*d -within two weeks after vaccination.
Tn this ca*e the Infection -did not appear for
tferee weeks afterward. I am satisfied the.
vaccination was only a contributing cause.
Dr. Herrick said: / '
1 vaccinated the boy en August 14. HÂ«'W&Â»
geing to school and his parent* were . obliged
to have him vaccinated In order to meet the
law's requirement*. The virus used was stand
ard and presumably pure, as It came from a
ftrÂ»t -class drugjrist and was a part of a Â«Â«up
p!y that is replenished weekly. I srave : the
proper directions for dressing and handling the
casÂ». which were followed \u25a0. by the boy's
mother bo far as I have been able to learn. I
A week aco yesterday I was called to the
house and I found that the boy wÂ» sufTerinx
from tetanus?, or, as. it U mere .commonly
known. lockjaw. The Infection had .probably
started la the open Â«ore left by. the vaccina
tion operation. The case was a fatal 'one. ~I
hayÂ« des&ruited vaccination in th* death cer
tificate as the contributory cause of .death.
This I waÂ» corroelled to do. That the ope
ration wa* th* direct- cause " cannot be poe
eible, for the tnfectkm would have been mani
fested within trn.days after vaccination.- The
tetanus rercno conld' .have been introduced
throucrh any. open wound, a- scratch on- thÂ« i
hand fof example. I deplore this fatality,: for
it KiveÂ« argument to thÂ« anti-vaccinatlonUts,
acd I am a firm beli\"eer in . vaccination. â¢'
Wbenw came Uie EÂ«ima is difficult to deter-"
mine. Scratching of the wound mlrht have
been the source of -the trouble. Unsanitary

18.000 members.
The Idea of the "retreat" will be car

days the delegates .will be in Chicago.
They will not necessarily be cut . off
from- the world, but those who -wish
may.'- live so as to see no one except
members of â¢ the brotherhood from
Wednesday to Sunday evening. . The
university authorities have furnishd
many of the lower group apartments
with almost monastic simplicity.
Women v/ho accompany their hus
bands or brothers to the <, convention
will have a taste of the monastic; life.
For femln'ne -use one of the, "co-ed"

VIGOROUS
DEFENSE OF
SYNDICATES
Treasurer of Life De
clares That Only Combi
nations /of Capital Can
Handle Big Investments
FKANK STATEMENT
TO INVESTIGATOES
New York State Legislative
Committee Learns Some
More of Financial Meth
ods in Insurance Affairs
NEW YORK, Sept. 13. â A vigorous
defense of syndicates and their oper
ations in connection with the insurance
business and a frank statement of per?
sonal profits gained through their oper
ations made by Frederick Cromwell,
treasurer of the Mutual Life Insurance
Company, was the feature of to-day's
session of the special legislative com
mittee appointed to probe methods of
life insurance companies in this State.
The defense of . the syndicates was
made by Cromwell soon after he was
called to the stand in the morning/ Be
fore he was asked a question he begged
leave to say a few words, and upon
being directed to* proceed said:
The law or combination, which affects
finance as everything else, has maue syndicates
necessary. Wten 1 became Ueasurer of j the
Mutual Life Insurance Company the total as
aet* of our comoanjv were $IW),CM>,OUU. â¢ The
transactions in my department \u25a0 now are more
than $ICO,OCO,WXÂ» lÂ»?r annum. When ' our re
ceipts were less â twenty years ago â it i was
quite possible fcr us to buy from bond dealers
and pay the successive profits, but now It is
absolutely impossible to buy advantageously
laifct blocks of securities, except, as they. are
allowed by the combinations of capital, popu
larly ' called syndicates, and we have to so
into them to gÂ«t uur investments and get them
In sufriclent size and at "ground floor" prices.
We could net make our Investments without
syndicates and we-nre partners in every syndi
cate Into which we go. . 1 want to say further
that unless we went into these syndicates we
would not be able to invest cur fund* except
by buyinsr in small quantities and paying tne
successive profits of middlemen.. â¢ ' ."\u25a0
(450.000,000 ASSETS:
I ask you, Mr. Hughes and the committee,
to consider that we have now over $450,000, 00U
of assets and while we have over $1U0,U00,000
invested in bonds and mortgages, we are con
stantly under the necessity of^ finding addi
tional investments for cur large accumulations
of 'unds. This is the condition. ,It is no the-
ory. It is a condition which we meet and the
exhibits are here which show how we have to
employ it. Our" investments are such that
when Mr. Tappan. I suppose about the most
widely known and honored bank president in
his day, died in New York, he left it as a con
diticn that his trustees should have one privi
lege and that was to invest in the same securi
ties as the Mutual Life Insurance Company.'
That is the way we invested our money, but
we could not make the transactions, of 9100.-
CCO.OOO a year In the securities bought by this
company without-UElnc syndicates. .
The acknowledgment, of personal
profits was made in a tabulated state
ment, which was presented to the com
mittee after recess. -It showed that
Cromwell had made a personal profit
of 526,371 from syndicate operations
during the last five years, in .which he
individually and the. Mutual Life ;\u25a0_ In-,
surance Company had participated. ...
Mr. Hughes/chief counsel of the com
mittee, immediately took up an esti
mate of these syndicate transactions in
an effort to ascertain the manner: in
which these profits. were'obtaln'ed.
A point was brought out ' when \u25a0 prob
in?. a transaction of. 'the Pennsylvania
Railroad 3^. per."- cent convertibles.
Cromwell ; made no "personal, profit," the
witness stated. ' - ; ? '\u25a0 - '.-"\u25a0â¢'_; :'â¢\u25a0'
"Of course we are greatly interested
in the 'Pennsylvania, Railroad.. I. might
say we are' the heaviest \u25a0 stockhofders.".
THE JAP.OiESE LOAN.
- - Answering. Hughes,' Cromwell said
the holdings of the Mutual. Life. in the
Pennsylvania Railroad were $5,Q00;000
par. Among these transactions "the
connectldn of companies .with the
Mutual' Life' was brought out when Â£it
was stated that the one million pounds
sterling j subscription 'to \ a 1- Japanese
loan .was shared by the ' United States
Mortgage and Trust Company and the
Guarantee. Trust- Company. : ; In ex
plaining this relation Cromwell-said: J
We . gave- . these - opportunities to " the : truat
companies in which we held large interests for
very, seed reasons. / As .l explained this morn
ing we, .as an insurance company. - need very
large banking \u25a0 facilities for very I large . inter
ests. It zocs without saying that it is better
for us to use our own companies rather than
give to Institutions with which we' have no
connection the handling of our. large Invest:
menti 1 . For. this reason we put men into the
directorate Of ,i these subsidiary, companies to
look after the Interests of ' the ; Mutual. , They
are'not there for , the profit of the interest on
the paltry 100 shares they have' to hold, but
to protect thÂ» Mutual. It Is natural. we 1 should
wish to put in as directors of these-, companies
the same men as are on the hoard of the Mu
tual. I have 100 shares in these companies as
a director, but I have never made : any secret
of it. . \u25a0" . . . , ' : â¢,-.;.â¢-..\u25a0,
The result of our connection. with: these com
panies is that In fourteen years wehave'made
through them , a profit of SIOO.OOO.pCO for the
policy \u25a0- holders. - : If we had ' not \u25a0'. these institu
tlons we should have to turn the Mutual Life
Insurance Company" into a banking : lnstitution
as well as a life Insurance- company. This we
could not do. - '. -';, , . . r t. , ; >-,-., v â¢'
/ Thls being the state of the easel it is natural
we should help these subsidiary Institutions to
make money- ana should throw opportunities in
their . way. v The men we put ! In ; them are not
there for their own profit* .They -never -get a
dollar out of the ;Mutual<- unfairly and' everY
cent' they make' through -'those trust "companies
and banks for the .Mutual Is: for 'the: policy
holders and the policy holders alone.

Just-, before closinp the inquiry for
the day. Hughes said: \ ; . -

Play Svengali
at a Matinee
WELL KNOWN ACTOR WHO WILL
APPEAR AT THE COLUMBIA AS
SVENGALI. ,
' Wilton Lackaye will appear, at the Co
lumbia Theater next Wednesday after
noon as Svengali in a special matinee per
.forniance of "Trilby:"., So many requests
were made for a performance of this play
that San Franciscans might again | have
the opportunity of seeing Mr. Lackaye in
this celebrated characterization that the
management decided to break into the
successful run of "The Pit" for one per
formance. . - ;
Mr. Lackayi included this play in his
repertoire this season in view of the
great success of the revival . at the Xew
Amsterdam Theater last May, when it
was presented by the original cast.' It
was one of 'the greatest^hits of the sea
son in New York, and started a "Trilby"
craze like that of a decade ago. ; when
Trilby shoes, gloves, horses, yachts and
other articles of apparel and entertain
ment were to i be seen on everj' side.
' The company supporting Mr. Lackaye
this season is a very strong one. and uni
formly well balanced. "Trilby" was
given by it in Seattle and Portland, and
was very highly praised.

Around; Dead Man ? s Keck Is
Found Part of Veil With
Whiclr Be ; Straiigled Girl
MIXOT^ X. D.,-Sept- 13.â The body of
Charles -Herzigr. who left a written con
fession of Â«thY crimes of assault and mur
der committed near .Youngstown, Ohio,
more than' thirty years ago. has been
found by a posse of searchers hanging
to a tree In a secluded ravins just over
the line in the county of \N allace. Pinned
to his -breast was a' piece of wrapping
paper on which was written the follow
ing: , ,<-l>r, .
"My name- is. Charles . Herzlg. Over
thlrtj' years ago I murdered a young girl
named -Lizzie E. Grombacher. near
Youngstown, Ohio. - .Charles Sterling, a
Innocent-man; was tried, convicted and
hanged, for the; murder of this girl. If
my body is ever found; notify my mother,
Katberine Herzig. at Glrard. Ohio."
If Herzlg had not left a written con
fession and threat o* suicide at the B}er
ranch his body, might never have been
found ; f or years; as It was hanging in
a spot seldom visited. Around his neck
was j a shred of greÂ«n veiling, such as
women use for face veils. It is recalled
by a former -Youngstown man here that
Lizzie Grombacher wore such a veil
when murdered and that part of it was
used ' to " strangle her. The ; piece found
about Herzlg's neck is supposed to be
the remainder of the veil, as he showed
such a piece to a fellow-ranchman named
Olsen, to"- whom he told the story -of his
crime, declaring that he had kept It all
these "years so as to use "It to end his
own life some day. : Olsen recalled the
details of Herzlg's confession to-day. At
the time it was" made he thought Herzlg
demented. Herzlg. said after committing
the. murder and. exchanging shirts with
Sterling he. went to Warren, Ohio, where
he was employed as a gardener by a
lawyer named Ratliff. After Sterling's
arrest and trial he: fled to Mesopotamia.
Pa., where he remained in biding until
eve of Sterling's execution, when he
stole ah orse and went West. He settled
in Telluride. Colo., where he- married.
Ohio. people commenced to move. in. and
becoming frightened, he deserted his
wife and child and went to Death Valley,
in California. Since then he had been a
wanderer.
MAY iVEBT A STBIKE
OF FKEIGHT HANDLEES
Chicago Kailroad Managers
Agree to Confer With
Men.
CHICAGO, Sept- 13.â The relations be
tween the railroad companies and their
union freight handlers, who are demand
ing an increase of 10 per cent In" wages,
assumed a more "conciliatory - aspect to
day, and' the indications to-night are that
the threatened strike of the 6000 freight
; handlers will be averted. â¢ Although re
fusing to treat directly with the Freight
Handlers'- .Union, the - railroads have
agreed to meet the employes as Individ
uals, and arrangements have been made
by the j union to have committees repre-.
sentlng the men in each- of the freight
houses meet, the railroad officials to-mor
row in aai effort \u25a0to reach some sort of
an agreement. "
' The general 'managers of the railroads,
it was said to-night, would be at to-mor
row's meeting. and would agree to sign a
working agreement. similar to that which
expired .last: June, but would refuse to
recognize the union or to agree to any in
crease in. the wage scale. Heretofore the
reads have been unwilling to arbitrate the
difficulty. â

pfTTSBURG. Sept. 13.â Sixty passen
gers were injured, nine seriously, by
the overturning of, a^ trailer attached
to a car; on- the Homestead division of
the Plttsburg Street Railway Company
near the" Glenwood bridge this morn
ing." The i more seriously . hurt \u25a0 were
taken to the hospital, where they will
be compelled to; remain for some time.
The others were able to proceed to
their hdbnes after having their injuries
dressed. V '
The car and trailer were crowded to
their fullest capacity, many of the pas
sengers â¢being. workmen on their Way to
the various plants in the vicinity. There
is a steep grade from the Glenwood
bridge:.- to \u25a0_\u25a0; Hays Junction. At Hays
Junction "there is a sharp curve. The
first car managed to round the curve,
but the trailer,, carrying sixty passen
gers," was, thrown from the rails on Its
side. - . "
People have no idea how
crude and cruel soap can be.
It takes off dirt. So far,
so good; but what else does
it do.
It cuts the skin and frets
the under-skin; makes red-
ness and roughness and
leads to worse. Not soap,
but the alkali in it.
Pears* Soap has no free, al-
kali in it. It neither reddens
nor roughens the skin. It re-
sponds to water instantly; wash-
es and rinses off in a twinkling; is
as gentle as strong; and the
after-effect is every way good.

Flood of Spurious Five-Dol
lar Gold Pieces Turned
Into Marts of Berkeley
MERCHANTS VICTIMIZE!)
Government Officers Called
In to Hunt Down the Dar
ing Bad Money Operators
BERKELEY. Sept. 13. âA i flood of -j
counterfeit five-dollar coins' has ' been â¢
turned loose by clever crooks during the j
last week in this town, and as a result â¢
secret service agents from San Francisco
visited Berkeley to-day- to co-operate
\u25a0with the local police department in an
attempt to set a clew, to the gang that
is believed to be behind the swindle. . j
It developed as a result of the confer
ence between Marshal Vollmer and the
secret service men that Berkeley is not
the only field chosen for the operations
cf the counterfeiters. In San Francisco
a great quantity of the spurious bits of
metai have been worked off, and the Gov
ernment agents have been at work for
come time attempting ' to' secure clews
which might lead to the arrest of the
crooks. \u25a0""\u25a0 " .
The fact that the counterfeiters have
begun work in Berkeley is an item that
the Government men were glad to learn,
as it is expected that trace Of the crooked
work can be more easily gained. in small
cities than in San Francisco, and if the
crook? are working in Berkeley the Gov
ernment detectives are confident that
they have become sufficiently bold to
venture out, a circumstance that is
likely, they say, to lead to the ultimate
undoing of the counterfeiters.
Louis Buff, a merchant at 2173 Shattuck
avenue, is one of the dozen merchants
of. Berkeley who has been victimized. by
the counterfeiters. He took in a gold
piece four days ago from two strangers,
who purchased sixty cents? worth of
goods. They kept the coin in their
hands, after showing it and asking for
change, and gave it to - the merchant,
just as he passed them the change, mak
ing a hurried departure at once. \
- When Mr. Bunt came to examine the
coin he saw that it was a counterfeit
and yesterday reported the matter to
Marshal Vollmer. Other merchants
made similar complaints. . The name of
the victims in Berkeley will not be re
vealed by the local police, who decline
to discuss the case.
.Detective Jamison was* detailed to warn
merchants who have not thus far report
ed receipt of the counterfeit coins, and to
request that they co-opeiate with the
police in watching for the crooks, should
they appear.
. Becret service men say that counter
fells of .five-dollar, coins are rarely at
tempted, the material and apparatus re
quired for their make being more eit
pensive and elaborate than for other
sorts of coins," and the danger of detec
tion beings much greater.' They admit
that the. rewards are much greater when
the f coins 'are successfully passed, ''and
declare that all signs indicate that an
unusually . daring and skillful band of
operators is at work.

WITH DEADLY POTION
Archibald Ralston Jr. of Boston Cbrr^
mits Suicide at Delrnonico's
"There's nothing doing â nothing do
ing?."
With these words of attempted . as-
sirar.ee that he -was all right, Archi-
hald Ralston Jr. of Boston last evening
quietly waved a -waiter out of his
apartments at the Delmonico restaurant
on O'Farrell street. Suspecting that the
pueft of the establishment was not
himself, the waiter returned a few* mo
ments later to find Ralston lying on the
bed unconscious. He was breathing
heavily and showed evidence of having
taken poison. The waiter Immediately
summoned assistance. Dr. W. J. Bauer,
â¢who was called from a neighboring
drug store, declared that the man was
dylEg. but not satisfied with his report,
the proprietors of the restaurant sum
moned Chief Surgeon J. L Stephens of
the Emergency Hospital.
He agreed with his medical, associate
that Ralston had not long to live, and
fearing the notoriety that would attend
the death of a young man m their estab
lishment, the restaurant proprietors per-
Evaded the doctors to remove their pa- j
tient to some other place. A carriage
was called, the unfortunate young man
bundled into it and a start made for the
Emergency Hospital. Just as the car
riage wheels were rumbling over the car
tracks at Sixth and Market streets,
Ralston died.
i:\DS A LO\G DEBAUCH.
The death in the carriage termin
ated a four weeks' debauch, fraught
with several startling Incidents, ot
which the most sensational was Ral
ston's attempt to kill the woman who
had been his companion on a trip to
Santa Craz. Her name is Hattie Tee-
Aboalt, a denizen of a house at 322 Mason
street, from which she suddenly disap
peared last evening, when she was
warned that the police were looking for
her. She had been with him during the
day and It was after she had left him
in the room at Delmonico** that he
tock the poisonous potion.
Ralston came to this city from Port
land four weeks ago as the manager of
the Boston PharmicaJ Company, of
which John Taylor, president of the
Boston American baseball leagnei is
the head. His mission to the coast
v.as to look over the agencies of his
company, of which he had been the
manager for two years. During his
few days in San Francisco Ralston was
a nightly patron of the tenderloin re
corts a.nd finally the victim of a guilty
love for pretty Hattie Teeboalt. Drink
heightened his infatuation for the
blonde-haired woman of the half
world and it did not surprise Ralston's
> new-made friends when they learned
that be and the were spending his
money in a reckless manner at a hotel !
â¢in Santa Cruz.
HATTIE TEEBOALTS STORY.
According to Hattie Teeboalt 's story,
Ralston wanted to marry her, and when
\u25a0he spurned his overtures he threatened
to kill her. Three weeks ago they dined
together in Santa Cruz and then ad
journed to their apartments, where Rals
ton, on the verge of delirium, forced her
to adorn herself in her best gown and
Jewelry. Then he put on his dress suit
f and summoning a waiter: ordered two
cocktails.. When the drinks were served
Ralston, according to the story of Hattie
Teeboalt. quietly dropped a powder into
each of the glasses and commanded her
to drink. .
Designing his murderous intent. Hat
tie quickly sprang toward the table
.t nd knocked the glasses to the 'floor.
Ralston sprang upon her, but in >\u25a0. his
-weakened condition his :' companion
proved too much for him. and/ throwing
him aside, she ran into the hotel cor
ridor screaming for help. '<*
The attendants at the hotel soon {had
Ralston under confrol, and the following
day a local representative * of " the firm
that Ralston represented was advised of
the latter's condition and hurried r down
to Santa Cruz, where he arranged 'for
the care of his manager until ' he could
' Â«ober up sufficiently.^ to return to this
city. Meanwhile, however, John Taylor,
who had been sojourning "in : Southern'
California, had learned of Ralston's act,'
and came to this city. Satisfied that: it
would be useless .to " try to straighten
Ralston up," he ordered his dismissal and
returned to Boston.
AFFAIR AT THE BEACH.
With his' lncome gone and certain of
disgrace ' at home, Ralston, on returning
to San Francisco, whither Hattie ...Tee
boalt had preceded him, again took to
drink. Bet his money was gone and the
friends who were wont to enjoy hlsihos-
Fitality under the rays of the red lights
now turned against him. Even !a the
house on Mason ' street, where 'Ralstcn
had Fpent his money lavishJy, his credit
\u25a0was no longer good.
>, He quarreled with the mistress of the
K Â£>ace, and " later . meeting her at. ..a
roadhouse on, the Ocean Beach, he at
tacked her and was badly scratched
during the fight. .
The incident at.the beach took place
three nights ago and was really the be-
ARCHIBALD RALSTON r JR.. ' WHO
COMMITTED SUICIDE AT DEL
MONICG'S RESTAURANT.
ginning of the end of Ralston's reck
less career. When he returned to the
Grand Hotel he found his rooms locked
against him, and, being unable to settle
his bill, he went to Delmonico's for the
night. -
One of Ralston's associates during his
stay in this city was M. G. Scarth, who
had accompanied him from|Portland, be
lieving that Ralston would secure him
a position here. Yesterday afternoon
Scarth, who | had shared Ralston's room
at the Grand, received a telephone mes
: cage from Ralston, stating that he was
; In Delmonico's, but unable to pay his bill. -
He wanted Scarth to Join him, but the
i latter refused. It was learned that Hat
i tie Teeboalt had been with Ralston in
the restaurant for a time during the day,
but had departed, promising to return
later in the evening.
Scarth, appreciating Ralston's predica
ment, later In jj the evening told several
friends of the Delmonico incident, and
j they were planning how to aid Ralston
; when -they received a telephone from the
restaurant that he was very 111. When
Scarth reached the. place a few minutes
later he was told that his friend had died.
This proved . a mistake, however, for
, Scarth learned that Ralston had Just
been removed from the restaurant. While
Ee'was talking with the waiters, how
ever, the message came that Ralston had
died on his way to the hospital.
, LETTER TO FRIE.VD.
Every possible means was . adopted
by the proprietors of the restaurant
to conceal the facts of Ralston's death,
in so far as they knew them, and " It
was only after' the detectives .'had
threatened to take them to the City
Prison that they furnished any de
tails of the case. Scarth was taken
Into custody and closely questioned
about his friend and finally satisfied
the police that his acquaintance with
the dead man was a chance one and
prolonged by the hope that It .would
result in .remunerative employment.
Late last evening Scarth received a
letter written by: Ralston 'â Just before
he swallowed the poison. > It ; was ad
dressed to Scarth at the Grand Hotel
and read as follows:. -

"MANON LESCAUT" IS CHARAING
(Puccini'^
Masterful Leadership of Polacco. r
Juovers ot Music
Experience
q I rpor
, San : Francisco s proclaimed Itself last
night as provincial - as ; New ; York' or Lon
don" itself. - Half i a house ; pioneered â¢ the
hearing, of : "Manon":- Lescaut,'!4 practically i
new; here,*' because ; Slgnor -Iââ -~ was ; not !
pirogrammed therein, or Signorina-â^.- It is i
to say,? withall possible content, that' the â¢
recreant " audience -J lost : heavily :. thereby. !
More ' beautiful ; than '."La ; Boheme,* 1 \u25a0 with,' j
in Signor Coppola,^- a ; second '-â¢ Salezaâex
cept in c his" orthodoxy as Ito pitchâ with i a '
performance of the opera simply/electric,
and a house to match, \u25a0 last' night iwas so I
far.thenight of the season. Vâ¢, . j
\u25a0 It- was before Coppola's/ with' Puccini's
own,. Polacco,* night.'* The .; magnetism \u25a0 of '
the man,~; his : marvelous resource, : his grip â¢
upon his men,i were never ; more compel- j
lingly In' evidence. I
. They had-'hlmout after i the . second i
act's magnificent climax. \l : They.; 'had
himout again after thV third act,"after
a* hurricane -of ;'.'Polaccos."',; They." en-^
cored" the ' lovely- "Intermezzo," 1 and-: at
each return to â¢ the desk j signaled \u25a0 anew
their appreciation of the conductor.
And -one cannot see how'the]apprecia
tion could have been more -wisely
giveni more well deserved. 'With the
tropical luxuriance : of .the: orchestra,
with' its supremely insistent jdrama,-on
ly * the ; ablest generalship, 1 ; the : finest
sense "of values, could make of "Manon
Lescaut" much but a symphonic t poem
with vocal' accompaniment. â¢: It became
In , Polaccq's hands . royally _.<what
Puccini Intended. v Full ' value _to : his be
loved orchestra he gave, - yet .' never
for an instant did the drama' in front
of the footlights obscure that behind.
How deftly, too, the r conductor : used
the orchestra to cover -the vocal.de
ficit! It was, in short, for Polacco, -a
night of triumphs.
Only, to a few â¢ folkâ like PorteriGftr-
Snett,' who took all of the "Manon" the
! Del.Contls brought here and then went
to Oakland for moreâ the opera, was^ new
last night. If there be any,: \-irtue |In
signs, before the season Is over "Manon
Lescaut" will be rivaling "La Boheme."
This means much. "La Boheme'.' is " oh
the peaks of local favor. And for tSe
best of reasons. And the same reasons
for favor exist; in equal -degree in! the ;
"Manon." . Possibly the story of VLa Bo
heme". appeals more strongly, but to "off
set this, ls an Incomparably richer Inven
tion, an Incomparably greater luxuriance
and warmth of ' orchestral* color In the
"Manon Lescaut."
Nor Is the story much more human than
that of the Massenet "Manon,' V far be
low that of "La Boheme"- in appeal. V It
has been said, and Justly. "that? for the
period of the story the Puccini music is
too dramatic. It is also too modern.; Yet,
a's In the salon scene, the composer gets
a fine old-world flavor, a repose,^ an J ele-"
gance, that shows' well that, I ' an' he , would, 1
Puccini could have written in; the powder
and patches of the period; Just as t deli
cately, as fastidiously, as ; Massenet him
self. But one is grateful for, the warmth
and richness Jof - the ; work,^. the! thrilling
humanity, the superb dramatism r _V and'
"Manon Lescaut"; has arrived. â¢ ,'-; --,'\u25a0< .--.
Coppola, 1 the Dcs Qrieux," began modest
ly jas i his heraldry. -A" few aulet,' 'sure
notes dropped into \ the orchestral stream,
another . or two, and ; then : one began Ito
know - that here was s a voice." i Most ; like
Saleza, without, ; as \u25a0 before * said, Saleza's
betrayal of the pitch,v.Coppola sings.
His intonation Is miraculously i true, but
it is the purity, of the voice,, the astonish
ing range; the finish; flexibility, â¢ the ex
quisite taste of the singer .that mark hini
bo surely as of the chosen:; He : sings up
to anywhere \ and seems to have octaves
beyond that? In \ his grasp." i His \u25a0 articula
tion Is another, wonder, f. Not until. the end
of the third act did .Coppola" get much into
acting . mood-^-hls I fourth : act ; was charm

A POLITICAL EMERGENCY.
TWO years ago Abe Ruef participated in all of the preliminary
operations of the Republican party of this city. He was in a
confidential position which enabled him to know every move
ment made and contemplated. He was bound by every obligation of
honor and decency to support the action of the party. He was
held by bonds which grip at the conscience of high men and of
humble. With all of these party obligations upon him; affirmed
and confirmed by his presence and participation in the party coun
cils, after the tickets were nominated he took "leave of absence,"
walked out of the party, with all of its confidences in his keeping,
and supported its opponent and its enemy.
After using his knowledge of its purposes and hopes to defeat
it. he walked back into its convention, in the interest of harmony
made necessary by a Presidential campaign, received its honors and
wore them on the shoulders of as rank a traitor as ever betrayed
a trust. This man, scarred with the marks of every form of treach
ery that can emboss the record of a politician* is now made welcome
at a caucus of the minority of the coming Republican convention,
and raises the voice of a hypocrite and betrayer in behalf of the^
party whose ticket he will betray though it were composed of the
best men in full standing in the organization. Not only he intends
such treachery, but the frazzle which follows his lead it
to a man.
As. a result of his multiplied treacheries the governmenfof this
city has become filthy past endurance.' It has made. the name of
San Francisco' a stench all over the country. It has put us in the
class of Philadelphia under the Pilgrim Band and of Baltimore
under the Plug Uglies and Blood Tubs. The very stones of the
streets are slimy with the corruption that has resulted. His fol
lowers are in prison for crimes against the ballot-box, and under
sentence for bribery iri the Legislature. Vice pays tribute for a
license whichÂ® puts decency to shame, and official power fills its
pockets from the toll.
All this has come to pass from permitting Mr. Ruef to exert
influence in the Republican party in order to betray it. Out of
it has risen an emergency requiring that the decency of the city
combine in an effort to break the shackles of infamy riveted by. a
minority of all the voters. If the majority continue to divide, this
minority wins by a plurality, as it has won twice already. In the.
caucus of his frazzle Mr. Ruef lamented this getting together of
the manhood and decency of the city to defeat graft, theft and in
tamy. I
What business has he in a Republican caucus or convention?
By what commission does he criticize the leaders of the party thpt
he has betrayed? By what rule in politics do his followers, under
his lead, get the right to sit in a convention whose action, no matter
what it may be, they do not intend to support?
The impudence of the front, put up may suggest the necessity
of making v a clear cut issue by pitching the whole gang, neck and
crop, out of a convention which they enter only to make confusion
and disorder. Only treachery by these men and their leader de
feated the Republican party two years Â£go. The sanity, and sense
and local patriotism of that party are now leading it to the organiza
tion of a movement to save the city from the further consequences
of that treason. Against it the voices of the traitors are raised in a
canine chorus." singing the praises of straight party action, jthe sound
coming through mouths as crooked as ever touched a bottle.
One thing is sure. Hereafter, no matter what happens now>
the chronic traitors who sit in conventions and go put, .to ".defeat their
action vvil! be compelled to herd by themselves. If the Republican
party of San Francisco cannot get along without them it cannot
get along at all.
In the coming convention the Ruef frazzle has a programme of
deceit, confusion and delay. The pretense that it will organize and
control the convention is as false as its pretense of party, loyalty.
The majority of the convention understand that the highest
loyalty to party is loyalty to civic decency. The first thing to do
is to clean out the city government and fumigate the places it has be
fouled. The obligation to do this is upon Republicans and Demo
crats alike. Every man that can carry moral quicklime in his bal
lot to neutralize the filth in which Mr. Ruef fattens, as flies gender in
muck heaps, should be induced to'come to the rescue. If the con
vention do this it will fulfill its duty, and it should do it regardless
of the outcry of Mr. Ruef.
In his speech to his frazzle Mr. Ruef said, "I do not want to
be understood as supporting any other man than the one who has
been my friend through all." Through all what? Mr. Ruef is in
private life, and supposed to be practicing his profession. Iri what
sore strait or line of private profit has. he been that he needed the
friendship of the Mayor of San Francisco "throiigh all?"
Is it necessary to elect a Mayor to .stand by Mr. Ruef? What
does he represent and what is he doing openly or secretly that makes
the friendship of the. Mayor so necessary? 'What is the "afl"
through which the Mayor has stood by him? r Where have his feet
and fingers been in danger that made 'it necessary for the Mayor
to come to the rescue? .â¢
TOGO'S FLAGSHIP. ,
I~^OLLO\\ laG the disaster on the Bennmgton, the loss by fire
H* on the Japanese Mikasa teaches the navies of the world that
these great fighting machines on the -water -are to be watched
lest they destroy themselves and their crews. After all the.surmis
ing and investigating it has never been made certain that trie i
Maine was destroyed by any external cause. It is believed that the
hre on the Mikasa was* started by the failure of insulation of the
electric wires. .There has. always . been a suspicion that the Maine
magazines were exploded by her own electricity. If that ..were so,
it was a potent spark, for it caused a war that changed the political
and commercial geography of the world.
The Mikasa was destined. to be the "Old Ironsides" of the Jap
anese .navy. Her intrepid commander is just now the foremost
naval hero of the world. He fought his ship in the front, at Port
Arthur and in the decisive battle of the sea of Japan. She was
often 1 hit and hurt, but never put out of action/ Men and officers
fell on her decks, but her flag never dipped and her hoarse guns were
never silenced! Now nearly 600 brave sailors have gone down vvith
her, but while the brave of the world lament them, as the martyrs
of our Maine and Benhington were lamented, there is mingled with
it- a' feeling of satisfaction that her admiral, grim -old yTogo, was. not
involved in the disaster.
Great* sacrifices are sometimes necessary to install great pre
rautions. 'A thousand perished miserably in the Iroquois Theate r
lire in Chicago, but millions have been safer. by the lesson taught by
that awful disaster, .So the men of the Maine,; Bennington" and
Mikasa have not died" in vain if the naval powers of 'the world are
taught the need of forethought in safeguarding their ships against
such appalling sacrifices. On the Maine and ; Bennington we lost
more men than we ' did in battle 'in the Spanish and on the
Mikasa Japan lost more than were'killed on her ships in the battle of
the sea of Japan. BSE -'

FABLE OP THE TWO CREEDS.
TWO men met for the purpose of form
ulating a creed which should express
the One True Faith. ,
"I believe," said one, "in an all-power
ful, all-wise and all-just God, the Creator
and Father of us all."
"Good!" said the other one. "So do I.
Set it down." -.
"I believe that' lf the world would fol
low the teachings of the Man of Nazareth
the long-deferred day of its salvation
would be here." .
."Good again! So do I; and who . could
doubt it? Make a note of that, too.'\4 '\u25a0'â¢"â¢
"I believe that it Is right and justifiable
to sneeze . on six days in \ the week, but
not on the seventh day." 1 >
"Better yet! Write it down. It would
appear that we are fully agreed concern
ing the creed ti> - express the One True
Faith."
"I believe that* this seventh day, when
it is wicked to sneeze, is Monday."
"Oh, mv brother, my. brother, how can
you err so? Do you not know; that the
Law and the -Prophets make it clear, that
the unsneezing day is Tuesday?" , â.
So they dragged out all the "authori
ties," who were men Jike the" rest of us,
and fell to discussing the matter, and al
though this was long centuries ago their
descendants have been discussing it ; ever
since then.^and the argument waxes

the great things; and let the little things

Come to think about it, I had promised
myself that T would never write anything

that this story had better stop right here.

KEEP YOUR GIRLS AT HOME

DOROTHY EENIMORE.
LAST, June our; educational mills turned out a large number of girl grad
uates, who now, after > a \u25a0 summer' s { vacation, . are planning to r go to work.
A', few. of , them; are qualified' to become teachers,* but the majority will
seek positions of "one 'kind or another in business houses downtown. .^7;",. i-r.
Many have- no need of money,* but intend to do so either
because they, think it a fine thing to be independent .; or because they desire
to free. themselves from home restraints. '.
v Probably .1 cannot f convince, them that the money they will earn will
not compensate ; them -for: their personal loss, or^ for that which their families
will incur, for youth too often learns* only.. from that \u25a0â¢; hard teacher, expe-.
rlence.; But possibly I can persuade the j mothers ;of a few of \u25a0 them \u25a0 what a
, mistake they.'are.maklng^in* letting their daughters take this; step.
It; is not that I reject^ the theory that^ "self-support is good for women,
and that it marks an advance In womanhood. 'It ;is far better, for parents -to
fit their daughters,; as well as their sons,; to support ' themselves '= than ; it is
to teach' tr-T to /live;in^ idleness on .an inherited Income. -It; Is" well for
every 'girl to have a free choice in marriageâ a I'vllege. which cannot be
taken from one who, does not need. to" look -upon' matrimony -as' the only
means open to her of gaining a living.
I believe with all. my heart that girls should *\u25a0 Â» prepared for indepen
dence should necessity for It arise. .: . \u0084
:; But'l believe no less earnestly that, they should; be , given as f ull \u25a0'â a
preparation, as possible. They. 'should develop their -'individual, talents, and
they should be urged -to 'do this. In their! own' homes. .Both ;means and en
couragement for this; should, be. provided.' . i -,"> '.
:.. -I If a girl has not;thie strength and ambition to make' the -most of the
i opportunities which her parents aro willing to give her, she ;is "not to: be^
trusted to do amateur ; work, at ; low pay ;in the unfriendly,^unclean \u25a0 atmo
sphere of downtown. .She is still "a child,, with a ; child's";, irresponsible out-,
look on life, an d those who love her have no . moral right y to : commit :. the
folly of thrusting her into an.'adult. world whereher Innocence and inexpe
rience are unlikely to protect her.
\u25a0 For the girl who. actually^ has to work the situation is different.- Her
point of view is serious. ? She is making an honest fight; for her bread and
for her* future. She deserves every chance that.her more' fortunate sisters
can give her. V '','"'" ' v. . : /, . " . â¢
:. There Is nothing which hurts her position'so much as the oversupply of.
cheap labor, which As caused by the presence;in' the market of hordes of girls
who are ready to work. for almost nothing, ;- because they-^^have homes and
'families back of .them.-w ho really tsupport them.' '\u25a0
â¢ Mothers, keep your, daughters at home as long as you can,; If .you are
not positively suffering for the "money they could . earn. .; Develop whatever
talents they posses, for thus you put into" their' hands- the^ tools by which
they can, a few years hence," earn a : salary,^instead of wages. ; , â¢
. '\u25a0'-.- Teach them to.take care of themselves ahd their .belongings; it is
lesson which will be of use to themif the time ever comes ;when, they will
have to get along without you.- Give them some responsibility in the
rhtyusehold, for which you pay them enough to ; buy..; Jheir.: clothes and cover

\u25a0 Above all, make their home life attractive,' so that you can -keep track
of their interests and pleasures.; . . \u25a0'\u25a0â¢.;
You will find that such_a course vrill be economically a gain to you and
not' a loss. .
\u25a0 Except among the very poor.-a young girl is worth more to herself and
to her family than the wages she Is fitted to earn outside. Half the time
the girl. who works downtown; half -for/earnest, "half "for fun," makes hardly
enough money to pay for her lunches, her. carfare and her doctor's bills." -

MUCH ADO ABOUT
NOTHING.
an\6ptimist. .
HH f AS -it ever . occurred to you . that
the average life Is, largely a case
,of Much "Ado; About Nothing?
Well, it looks that' way to me, says
a writer In the. Philadelphia North
American; and I am .going, to try ,to
make; it plain to' you." unless 'it, ls al
ready , so. I' have; no" copyright on
ideas. ' J . '-\u25a0\u25a0
.And, before' we go on, let's thoroughly
understand -one", thing-^that such a
state of. affairs is all, wrong, and ought
to be 'righted; and that it can be righted
with -ai very.; small' expenditure of sin
cere effort -on the part of each one of
us..; ; \u25a0 \u25a0"\u25a0'.'...'\u25a0-
Of course,; there are some folks who
would not "want to change, even* If they,
had the power,'; and . -'knew they ' could
exercise "It 'successfully. There's a spe
cial brand 'of ' humanity, of which free
samples V, have i> been : pretty . generally
scattered .about through ; the world,
which wouldbe utterly miserable if de-j
prived of the'chance to make Much.'Ado
About> Nothing. They delight in mak
ing it a . sort of Constant _; Companion,
and - they', thrive ' on - ; it . and grow fat or
thin,- as the case' may, be. -
\lf you belong to this class, stop read
ing right" here,. and turn to some other
part of . the paper. ; /This " particular ar
ticle: is being written for the benefit of
those who,' like the writer," really want
to learn how-to : live with ; less friction
and more happiness, less Quibbling and
more accomplishing,' * less waste and
more ? profit. " '-':"'\u25a0'" *
" There" is a way ".to do this, and one of
the best methods of getting into;, that
way :is to stop making Much Ado About
Nothing. '.'..Â»' \u25a0
START OF THE DAY.
\u25a0 Supposed we start ' in with \u25a0an average
day of an average person, and see
where ; we. come. out.' - â¢.. Â»
It's so hard to get out of bed ! Indeed,
my friend, v'tis r hard to^ do anything
without \u25a0making^up'your^mlnd to do it.
And persbnal "experience. has taught, me
that; the' easiest way;. to Â± get over this
feeling is- to get "out of bed without
stopping to think ho^vliard it is.. f
It's so easy to be cross !and impatient
with any v one"' who happens to spea,k
to you before .But stop , a
minute, and consider whether such a
tourse '.will '.make you or'anyi one a eise
any happier.or in : any way ; lighten the
task of the'day before you, .or better
prepare you to-do it well. So what's
the use?
The coffee's cold and the toast is too
dry; and you hayelo eat at the rate of
te"n mouthsful -a minute in order, to
catch the 1 right train or the right car.
Possibly, rlfr If you had arisen ten minutes
earlier all this could have been avoided.
That ten minutes is a good, deal like
the proverbial inch on the end of a
man' 3 nose!.
All Much Ado \Abqut Nothing!
IS IT WORTH AVHILEf
.Ten minutesniore.in bed, a careless
expenditure :of ; temper and a condition
of breakfast-for which you yourself are
largely, if mot .wholly, responsible â
what will these things; amount to in
half an hour? You can make up tha
ten minutes to-night; your temper will
stay. with you without constant exer
cise, and there will be another break
fast to-morrow, morning.
All true. and logical. Isn't it? . -
Then ; you .rail at the railroad or thy
trolley company if : the train. or the car
is five"; minutes. late. ..Say you are get
ting SJ2S/aS J25 /a week ; for J fire ; days 'of ten
hours each and 'one of *; five.' '.That's
J25 for fifty-five hours-^-we'ir call if 50
cents.an hour, arid then go to the other
extreme and generously, call" it,a cent
a^minute. Is it really worth while to
lose your self-control for 5 . cents, or
even 10?, Will it be impossible to make
up for either space of time by working
a little, harder when you / get to the
store or the;ofilce?
When you Vet on the train .or the car
you may hav^ to stand. .Now, of course,
you are entitled \u25a0 to a seat, but even if'
you don't get it. Ms- it . more fatiguing
to stand half an hour in this manner
tlian to stand two hours at a baseball
or a bargain counter?
You get piqued "at 'Jones . or envious
of Mrs. Jones /because he or. she can
afford^ to dress 'better than you, and a
little ".more" temper'ls put out at - com
pound interest. {Can Jones or: his wife
carry, : around ' a character - any, better
than -yours, if .you.attend ,to thlsilm
portant matter as . you . can-or should?
Are -clothes "THE standard?
vYou get. all '\u25a0wrought v up because
Smith doesn't agree with you as to the
President's policy. -Does it really make
one \whit , of : difference ,. to your health
or wealth^ whether or not the revenue
of San Domingo' is collected'by the

SACRAMENTO, Sept. 13. â Colonel
Thomas Wilhelni. assistant inspector
general of the Natidnal Guard of Cali
fornia, to-day submitted to Adjutant
General Lauck his report upon the an
nual inspection and muster of thÂ«> Na
tional Guard of California for the year
1905. Wilhelm was detailed for the pur
pose by the Secretary of War. He linds
: fault with the raunasToment of' many
companies in the; State, but commends
the militia as a whole.
He refers especially to Company B
at Colusa and Company D at Marysville.
He recommends that unless Company B
of Colusa mends its ways it be disband
ed. Company Cof Nevada City is also
adversely criticized. He thinks squad
movements and steadiness in the ranks
I can be improved throughout the entire
Second Regiment. He compliments Colo
nel H. I. Seymour on his attention to
duty.
With respect to the militia companies
in San Francisco and Oakland, condi
tions were found satisfactory In most
instances, although the inspector makes
many recommendations looking to the
i improvement of the armories and drill
; ing of the companies. He says the drill
In the firings should be Improved
throughout the entire Fifth Regiment.
Most of the companies In San Francisco
and Oakland could be assembled for
duty in two hours. He considers that
the supervision of the organized militia
of the State by the higher officers is-by
no means sufficient.

ONE AVERS; G)f HER: IS. V THIEE
Plea That Alleged Larceny Was Merely
Borrowing Is Scouted' by. the Judge.'
JAMES O CRAWFORD.
Miss Beatrice MoffatCwds- pronounced ~
guilty of having' stolen certain articles of
wearing apparel -. from Miss ; Deborah Mil -.
ler, despite a defensive ; plea that -the 'al
leged larceny, if viewed from an ethical
standpoint, was not larceny/- at ; all, but
simply borrowing without having 'notified
the owner "of the wardrobe . of * intent .'to
do so. . '\u25a0 ' i;''f r ':'p "_':â¢'.- .'\u25a0"'..\u25a0': .". -V, -.*':
"Why, my gracious,"- eald Miss Moffatt
to Police Judge Mogran, "me and Deb
were roommates, and* I'm sure that she
was welcome to help herself to any of
my things -that I wasn't .wearing.;! have
roomed with other girls and We wore each
other's things without' ever saying, 'By
your leave.' What has/come over Deb
gets me.' If she had taken every stitch
of clothes belonging to -mÂ« I wouldn't
a-had her arrested,- for, I know what
chumming means. But one can never tell
who to trust or what's "a-going to hap
pen."
Miss Miller warmly combated the de
fendants Insinuation that theft was not
intended. "There was no borrowing about
it." 'exclaimed Miss Miller. "My. thnigs
were stolen, and if I hadn't stopped' the
stealing I wouldn't i a-been left : with a
stitch to wear. What did she take?. Well,
there was some lingerie and two pairs of
French-heeled shoes and a, black ./dress
that cost me thirty-five and :is ; worth
thirty-five : of . any one's; money: this min
ute, ahd a Polar turban that I hadn't
worn half a dozen times. There's. no u?e
In Trix saying she don't know what has
come over me, for we -were long enough
together for her to understand , that ?if
there was one thing I wouldn't do it was
to let any one else wear â¢my things. If
she only intended to borrow them, why
hasn't she brought: them back to. me?!'
"That's so," quoth the | Judge; "why
hasn't she?" Then he Informed Miss Mof
fatt'that If she has not returned tip Miss
Miller that lady's missing wardrobe be
fore high noon to-day she will be more
severely punished than she would \u25a0 be if
stt44 restitution had been made. Where
upon Miss SxUi'utU toss-r4 her head and
guessed the . things would be restored to
her erstwhile roommate.
The Misses Moff att and Miller jointly
occupied a suite at' 359 O'Farrell street,
where Miss : Moffatt performed , manicur
ing and Miss Miller taught the piano
forte, being qualified to do -so, ; she
having starred as a ' virtuoso in . Mexico
and Central America.

an Eddy street cafe and fell asleep while

CATASRH
A UNIVERSAL DISEASE
â¢ Catarrh usually begins* with a cold in
the head, but does not stop there. The
raucous membranes all become inflamed
and secrete a filthy, unhealthy matter
which is absorbed by the blood and dis-
tributed to all parts of the body. The
patient is then continually hawking
and spitting, the nose is stopped up,
the ears have a ringing br buzzing noise,
the throat becomes sore, and as the un-
healthy matter more 'thoroughly satu-
rates the blood a general feeling of des-
pondency takes possession of the system.
I had Catarrh for about fifteen years,
end no zaan could have been worse. I
tried everything I could hear of, but no
cood resulted. I then began S. S. S.,
and could see a little improvement from
the first bottle, and after taking, it a
short while was cured. This was six
years ago, and I am as well today as any
man. I think Catarrh is a blood dis-
ease, and know there is nothing on earth
better for the blood than S. S. S. No-
body thinks more of S. S. S. than I do.
L,apeer, ilich. . 21. XIATSON.
Local applications cannot cure Catarrh,'
because they do not reach the seat of the
trouble. . They allay the inflammation
and temporarily relieve the disease, but
as soon as they are left oil th^ trouble re-,
turns. The only way. to cure Catarrh is
to treat it through the blood. S. S. S. soon
dears the blood of all Catarrhs! matter and
purges it of all irritating poisons, checks
further progress of the trouble and com-
pletely cures the disease. . S. S. S. keeps
the blood in per-
S^tggfei /sss> fectordersothat

EARLY INFLUX

Barney Schreiber Is Coming
Backâ Stalls at Oakland
Are Rapidly Filling Up
At this early date, for the racing season
here does not open until November
the management of the New California
Jockey Club Is in a quandary as to how]
to take care of the dozen and one stables j
that are shortly to be headed this way.' |
Many Middle Western strings have al
ready reached Oakland, and stall room
will soon command a premium. From the
number of applications received at the |
office Secretary Percy W. Treat says it is j
safe to predict that more Eastern owners
and stables will cross the Rockies this
winter than ever before.
Prominent among the early arrivals at
the track over the bay is Captain' R. R.
Rice, the Arkansas turfman, pne of the
biggest winners at Union Parky St. Louis,
under the Carmody regime. In his string
are eucli useful performers as Rightful,
Governor Davis, Duelist, Ora McKinney,
W. B. Gates, Paul Whaley, JCenova, Satin
Coat, Lone Wolf, Lucius,, Bear Hunter
and Wi^vam.- ",= ;;' ; .
' After trying various other climes, .where
the trade winds were . milder ' and the
money scarcer, Barney Schreiber has de
cided that this city was always his only
love. The genial Teuton has wired 'for
thirty stalls. ' / ; '
"*\V. W. Elliott, a St. Louis owner who
made many friends when here some sea
sons ago with Miss Mac Day and others,
is back again. His stable is already quar
tered at Oakland.
I William Egan, another St. Louis horse
man, has a select stable at Oakland.
"Kansas" Price has made application
for ten stalls.. His -string will include
Uncle Urigh (Padua), Schoolmate and
others. Price, it is understood,' has had
a successful season on the New York j
tracks. *
Elusive Tommy Griffin, the original
"man with the halter/ also signifies his
intention of racing at Oakland and Ingle
side. Tommy will bring out besides his
own stable some horses owned . by Tony
Aste. The latter from a humble boot
black rose to the dignity of being known
as a magnate.
Mike Daly, owner of Claude, speaks for
his old stalls. He was informed that tfiey
were at his disposal. After .the death
of D. Cameron at the recent Providence
meeting, Mike' purchased Prince Brutus.
From recent advices received Walter
Jennings, now racing In the- East, will
ship his stable to California about Oc
tober L
C. Stubenbord St. was so ple*ased with
his experience at Oakland, last season
that he will come back again. In his
stable are Elie, the conqueror of ; Dr.*
Leggo, and the crack two-year-old
Father Catchem. The latter holds the'
winning bracket record of the season. !
Another new face will be W. Mulkey,
the wealthy Kansas City turfman. He
is the owner of Ed Ball and other well
known money-earners.
The colors of Chirm and Forsythe will
also be seen here again during" the coming
season. Rowley Colston is still trainf^
for the stable, which Includes among,
others , Picture Hat, Osee, Tartan and
Male Hanlon.
Those j who play riders will have an
opportunity to string with Radtke, the
star of Latonla. The crack lightweight
will be out here with the stable of ' Jack
Keene, who raced I Mansard at Oakland
last year. In the Keene string now are
Pontotoc, Red Leaf, - The Rpustabout,
Mandator, Bird- of Passage, Rosl Nl Nl
and other clever ones. . .;.
Humo, a frequent \u25a0 winner in- good com
pany on the : far Eastern tracks. ; will
reach . here shortly; In charge of Trainer
Charley .Patterson.,,, Charley; will also
"prep" .: some youngsters ' for , the . Burns
& Waterhouse . stable.'^. \u25a0_
After completing, an Itinerary .which In
cluded Buffalo, Latonia, v , Portland : and
Sacramento, Dick Williams and his ; sta
ble are now under .- shelter^ at Oakland.
Dick, it Is reported, will \ do : most â¢of hU
racing at Oakland.: though ; : part Â« of his
string will be sent to. Los Angeles. "E. :
Walsh Is under contract to ride the Wil
liams horjses.' ''\u25a0%
One of the chief objections k to : racing
at Ingleside heretofore has been the lim
ited number of stalls at that track. !;, This
will be remedied next season by . the i use
of a hbrsecar that the Jockey/ Club is
having constructed ufori.use the I elec"
trie line between Tanforan and; lngleside.

walked Â» ln. . Harry Corbett and | a ; large
crowd were standing around ; the) bar

at the Iway Nolan "acted .prior/; to V the

matters.^and'hewas not slow in telling
Nelson' his-opinion of . Nolan. '.:';""â¢\u25a0
"He came here- broke from- Butte,":

mended him to you as a manager.- He

Portland Officials: Substi
tute' .Plated. Affairs
for Medals of Gold
DISCOVERY MADE HERE
Metal Blisters When Heat
Is Applied to a Prize
Won by an Olympic Boxer
,- If . the management of the Lewis and
Clark Exposition a^ Portland could hear
the caustic criticisms showered on it
yesterday, by the athletic members of tha
Olympic Club, who won the champion
ships during the past two months, It
would Imagine its feelings were hurt.
The feeling against the Portland exposi
tion people is due to * the medals , pre
sented the winners In the various tourna
ments. Instead of a gold medal, the vic
tors were given a medal that presented -
the appearance of gold, but which, upon
closer examination, proved to be copper
with a plating of gold.
This discovery was made by Al Kauf
mann, the" amateur heavy-weight cham
pion boxer of the coast. Kaufmann Jour
neyed to Portland to meet the heavy
weights of the country, and it was no
fault of his" that no one would consent
to meet him. Kaufmann trained hard
and faithfully and was rewarded with a
championship medal. The medal was Ilka
the one - presented to Willie Dwyer for
outpointing two men on separate even
ings. A similar medal was given "Bob"
Lundie for knocking out two men. Louis
Levy, the handball player, gained a
medal, as did Scott Leary, who broke tha
world's. record for 100 yards, and Francis
Galley - for â¢ winning thÂ« 220-yard, swim
ming race.- . -
Kaufmann made the discovery a as to
the quality of the metal yesterday, when
he had a-*jeweler make a fob out of tha
medal. .A3 soon as the soldering Iron was
used the gold-plating "blistered," and
the jeweler apprised the, boxer that tha
medal was made of copper, with a thin
plating of gold. Kaufmann did not Jteel
pleased, and Immediately told Dwyer,
Levy and others of his discovery. An 1
indignation -...\u25a0 meetinr" . iru held, and i
George Miehllng. tfie wrestling Instructor
of the Olympic Club, who left two days
ago for Portland with a number of wres
tlers, has - been _ informed and delegated .
with authority to register an emphatic
protest. Letters ,have been written
Miehllng and the latter will notify "Bert"
Kerrigan, manager of athletics at the'ex
position, of the state of affairs.-. ~
-'While in Portland the athletes were In
formed the | medals were valued at 522 50,
and . were made v by the wholesale to re
ward "chrwnpiona." Under the amateur
rules victors In boxing bouts are awarded
a $35 trophy, and it is displeasing to
Dwyer, Lundie and Kaufmann that they
should be given a medal that Is not worth
much.. . .
Levy,- Dwyer and others will take their
medals to a jeweler â¢ to-day to , be tested
as to their quality. -- /
The .athietic*. games' at Portland were
under the direction of James E. Sullivan,
secretary of the Amateur Athletic Union,,
who traveled from New .York to act aa
referee. 1, Among the competitors were
athletes from the East and also from Chi
cago. It, is presumed they received tha
same quality of medals.
MOTOR CYCLISTS ANGRY
AT SOUTHERN PACIFIC
Tax of Fifty Cents L.e-vled on Each Ma
chine Taken Across the Bay
on" Ferry Boats.
The motor cyclists of this city and
surrounding towns are up in arms
against the Southern Pacific Company
because that corporation Is charging
them; so cents for every machine they
take across the bay on the ferry boats.
The motorists claim this new charge
Is not fair, for. the reason that' big
autos are transported for 75 cents, and
as a motor cycle takes up but a twen
tieth part of the "space the comparison
is odious. The charge for ah orse and
wagon Is 50 cents.
]][ Under the State law bicycles are car
ried free on all boats and * railroads ' in.
California. The motorists claim their
machines are no larger than blcycfies,
and^argue .they : should be transported
free for the reason that each machine is
taken on board" at the risk of the owner
and Is handled by him.
Ruhlin to Ftsht Wille.
. SALT LAKE, Sept. 13.â Articles were
signed, here to-night for a twenty
found .contest : between the heavy
weights, John Wille of Chicago and Gus
Ruhlin, the Akron Giant, on September
27, before.the Athenaeum Athletic Club
of this city. The winner is promised a
match with Marvin Hart for- toe cham
pionship of the world.ARMY TRANSPORT SHERIDAN ARRIVES
BRINGS CAVALRY AND ENGINEERS FROM THE FAR EAST
Hidden in the Fog
for Several
Hours.
Wall of Mist Envel
opes the Big
Troopship.
The United States army transport
Cheridan, Captain Penbody in com
mand, arrived yesterday, from the Phil
ippines with more than 1300 passen
gers. In spite of the crowd on board,
however, the troop-ship comes back
from the Orient looking as clean as on
the day she sailed, and on his tour of
inspection, from bridge to bilges, Major
Devol found just as little dirt in the
corners and depths as on the clear.,
holystoned decks. He found the brass
work in the engine-room shined as
as the glittering rails around
T-.be bridge and the troop gaUery was as
spotless as the kitchen where the cabin
passengers' meals are cooked.
In spite of her healthy appearance,
however, the Sheridan needs the.doc
tor and within a few days an army of
mechanics from the Union Iron Works
will be busy administering to the needs
of her inner works. She will go out of
commission and wtu not make another
.voyage to Manila until February 5.
â¢Corporal' Tanner, the new com
rn&nder-in-chief of the Grand Army of
the Republic, went out on the tug
Slocuia to meet his son. Lieutenant E.
\V. Tanner of the Fourth Infantry.
The troops brought home on the
Eheridan included 283 members of the
Engineer Corps; 1T.3 enlisted men of
the Twelfth Cavalry; 368 casuals and
sick; 33 general prisoners; 65 marines
and blue-jackets, and 290 discharged
foldiers, sailors and civilians, includ
ing about thirty civilian teamsters.
Sergeant Major John F. S. Koch of
the Third Battery, Engineer Corps, who
was coming home for retirement after
thirty years' service in the army, died
August 31 of heart failure. His body
was brought home for burial.
Colonel Wygant of the Twenty-iSec
end Infantry was in command of the
troops. As captain in the Twenty
fourth colored Infantry, Colonel Wy-
Sant participated in the famous charge
up San Jilsin Hill, where he was severe
ly wounded."
Company X' of the Engineer Corps
has been on duty in Mindanao and
â¢^!r. ughout their service there the men
compelled to alternate righting
â¢u-iih work. They were in the war belt
and the insurgent natives kept the
smell of powder fresh in the soldiers'
nostrils all the time. The company has
been building bridges and wharves.
The Sheridan came into port- about
Â» o'clock yesterday morning and an
chored off Lime Point. Nobody knew
she was theiv, however.' on account of
the heavy curtain. of fog which shut put
completely that part of the bay.' She
pasFt-d quarantine about 2 o'clock, but
did not dock until nearly 5.

. The,re were* two. rallies .'in the: ninth
spasm at the Eighth street park yes
terday afternoon. - The Seals made the
first and commenced to shake hands
with: each other, for the game looked
in for sure. The Commuters then be
came endowed with that do or die spirit
and they, got' away, with- the glory with
only two-men. gone. "
. . Th<9re'waB not a man in. the lot who
would >trade a tripe sandwich' for the
Seals'- chances they j came up for
their final' licks 'ln the ninth. Oakland
was leading a to 0 and Schmidt had the
sign of the red man over.; every man
who takes â¢ money from . Uncle. \u25a0- As a
sort of wall from the dead, Wilson
chopped off a hit, but Wheeler and
Waldron, perished. .
>Then Schmidt' fell down by giving
Mohler a base on balls. ."Along came
Hlldebrand with a wallop out, to cen
ter which Pop Van Haltren booted and
both \u25a0 men tore to ' the pan, Hildebrand
pulling up at station two. He lingered,
but a second,' for Nealon was also there
with a drive and so was Irwin, making
the %core i to 3 with the Seals riding
easily.
'Everyone admitted the game was In.
The fans just lingered, each looking to
see the Commuters ;fall by the wayside
one, two, three. Whalen, who relieved
Hitt, passed Kelly and Richards laid
down a sacrifice. .Fatty Hackett took
a punch at. the leather and it came so
hard at Whalenit deflected and rolled
safe, making 1 a full house.''.' Along came
Devereaux and even ho. swung one to
center, letting Kelly through. Schmidt
worked 1 Whalen for another ticket and
the sacks .were "crowded again.- Van
Haltren put the finishing touch on the
glorious afternoon's work by coming
through with a short fly to center,
which whs easily . good enough to , let
Devereaux in. as Waldron is bad on the
heave. . . â¢ - .
/.The Seals did not figure at all during
those eight innings before, the big
stunt was pulied_.pff.. Schmidt .bud a
few of his ora v Ãr^tfkryn!lL\Vdst^rs sStdw
ed away up; his' sleeve and" he wound
them.-'so. skillfully that only one man hit
safely and that was Mohler in .the first
Inning. Schmiddy. was getting, the best
support' the Commuters had and the
Seals; were lucky 1 to have two men on
the. naths. â¢ \u25a0 : â¢< â¢/
In the meantime, Hitt was \u25a0 getting
his, as every Oaklander seemed 'to 'have
a hit all framed ; up whon he stepped in
to take a wallop at the ball. They were
all sousing right, especially when men
were on the sacks, arid the. three runs
wore easy for them. Schmidt was the
king of all sluggers, copping off three
hits out* of , three'ehances and. scooting
in .with two of the runs.
Dunlcavy furnished the fielding sen
sation of the oocaslpn In the fifth Inn
ing when Spencer started a hard liner
out between left and center.' It looked
good for two, "but Dun wus coming un
der a full .head, of steam rind 'he hooked
the bull with one \u25a0' mitt ere" it reached
the ground. He made the wlsÂ« move of
tossing it up in the: air immediately,
otherwise he did not have a chance to
make it stick. The score.

HIS ACT- DISHONORABLE. ,
Obtains an Audience With
the President by jink-,
ing False Representations
OYSTER BAY. N. V.. Sept. UâPresi
dent Roosevelt has denounced as a fab-
I rication and wholly without foundation
In truth the report of an interview with
him regarding the terms of peace be
tween Russia and Japan published, to
day in the Petit Parisien of Paris and!
cabled to America and published here:
this morning. As soon as the purported?
interview was called to his attention the
President directed Secretary Loeb to send
to the correspondent of the Paxisien, who
was received at -Sagamore Hill, the fol
lowing telegram :
OYSTER BAY. S. V.. Sept. 13 â Gaatoa
Richard. Hotel. Lafayette. New York: The*
President directs me to say to you that th*
allegde Interview with him published in thlÂ«
mcrnlng'* papers 19 nut only an absolute fab
rication, wholly without basis of troth, but
that your conduct in obtaining permission to>
seÂ« him under false pretenses la thoroughly
dishonorable. When you came to see the Presi
dent you Informed him that you ware the
grandson of Marshal 'Augereau: that you had
bwn at the battle of Mukden with the Ruaiiani
army and with the Japanese army afterward;:
that you understood thoroughly that you couldL
have no interview of any kind and that yuui
simply wished to pay a respect to htm.
Under these \u25a0 circumstances the President re
ctlved you and listened to your account â¢of
your experiences with the Japanese and Rus
si&ns and .-yoke to you also of the deeds of
Marshal Augereau and of Napoleon's other
generals. ~ .
The President had no conversation with you
about the terms of peace and your account of
Jycur alleged interview with him la a fab

J. E. B*che & Co. say in their New Tork
JLxcKlar:
' -iloney considerations have dominated the
market throughout the past week. Inducing
ht*vy eales on the part of professional oper
ators. Prices declined sharply, and stop loss
onlers were caught Iree'.y oa the decline.
Wt::e the fundamental ccailtions remained
unchiriged. the fact that stocks had to a cer
tain extent tone Into weak hands left the
darket open to attack asd # d*clininÂ«r prices
xoroefi this weekly held stock on the market.
Taere vu a reeling of nervousness tn the
:r.oney markets of the entire world. A lar . â¢
Kuasiac loan, in the immediate future. Is skid
to bÂ« among thÂ« possibilities of the situatior,
and if it is offered at this time, when New
icrk bank* are losing nearly a. million dollars
Â» a oaj- to the intericr. it is not improbable lhat
we thaZl see sr.arjj advancts in monef and
lower urices for securities.
"Oaf of the most important Influences in
hoidln*- prices during the week was the
Iron Age report, showing a continuation of
proapeiltjr in the steel and iron trades. Steel
r^il orders for UKt> arÂ« being placed freely.
Over â¬00.000 tons are already placed, and the
P-nncyivacia and Vaaderbilt roads will prob
ably add lanrely to this total in the near
Juture. Nearly all grades of finished material
eriow gratifying activity, while the pig Ircn
ciaricet continues active. The business situa
tion In the country leaves little to be desired.
"The sj>ecu!atlve situation hinges on the
nosey market. It seems probable that lead
ing barkers have rather looked with favor on
fcon*e curtailment of the bull market and a
readjustment of a somewhat lower level of
j rices. We are still bullish, ar.d feel that
rtocks ia time will sell at a hither level.
The market has iiad a five-point break, and
in* eeelir.e bas bten aeecm&anied by the
elimination of weak bull accounts and a
fce&vy increase in tfae volume of short com
mitments. The declaration of peace has un- :
doubted'y released large amounts of gold held
in European centers, and this will be available
fcp^'i: for ibe purpose el a Russian loan and '
_~W- export to this country Ehouid we need it.
iV ;s rrobatle the n-.arket will remain quiet ;
uetil the cutiook for money is clearer."
Dried Fruits In Â»tt York.
Late rej-orts by mail from New Tork say:
"A careful canvass of the several producing
districts in California has recently been made
by cne of the large packers who communicates
the results to his Eastern correspondents. Ac
cord jr.g to these, it would appear that the
quantity of apricots unsold on the coat-t W
small and held at high figures. In Southern.
â¢ "aliforxia only about 300 tons were found and
the quality cf this fruit was represented to be
V<oor. Nevertheless, the holders asked ex
tremely high prices, nothing being, offered un
der T ! g7%c for ungradM rtock. In Ventura
about 500 tons were unsold at the end of Au
cust. but the supply was being steadily re-
Coced by continual buying. There, too. 7c
Â»ef da inside figure for ungraded fruit, most
of :t beir.g held for mere money. In the Santa
Ciara Vali'y end north there was found to be
prartlca!!y nothing left In growers' handf. out-
Fide of- several large lots in tbe hands of peo
: pie -who are eaii to be abundantly able to hold.
ThÂ» t>ack*r sums up the results of his investi
gation in an estimate placing the entire stock
ir. growers' hands at not over 1000 tons, or i
fifty carl-^afiE at twenty temp each. There was j
DO cha&S* In the Pearh situation. Buyers j
continue to hold off for possible reaction
from the prfÃf-nt h!gh prices, but th*rÂ«? Is no
r.-efcsure to sell from any quarter. Prunes arÂ«
!n a somewhat similar position. New crop for ,
October jrhipment is he!d en a 3Â»ic f. o. l>.
basis for Sar.ta Clara and B%c for outside
stock, but buyers, in this section at least, are
not yet ready to make further purchases. In
epct prunes a fair amount of business L" be
ing done on Jobbing orders and prices are j
h*i4 firmly up to the quotations. California
RsiFir.p seÂ»~i to be in a state of waiting for
the ajmounrernent of operinsr rrice* on the

NEW YORK, Sept. i:i.â At a reflection cf
any fixed conviction en the prospect of values
to-cay's etock market we* not ot much use.
The- fiuctuatlum were c'on*isjit and never

which developed first were not continued, the !
ftor ,-ks arr<H ttÂ«l being left to themwlvet in the j
later dealings, while attention was turned u>i
Dew poicts. The erjtagemc-nt oT- gold yesterday
fcr shipment to N>w Ycrk continaed its 'good
effect on sentiment, but the mere urgent 6"- !
msnd fcr stocks which it stimulated yesterday !
was evidently from uncovered Bhorts an<l with
the Rsti-faction ef this demand trading to
day became larguid and lndifferer.t. Such
BpenStOOt as wÂ«nr done wnfrt to bÂ« fcr the
rurpos* of nourishing tbe market and guard
ing 't.:::;M a recurrÂ»ncÂ« of wcaJuvs*. <v,m
tr.ii=sion-house business was wixirted to be of
lnrfjjniScant \-olumÂ»Â». The perception grew
f'".hat the relinquishment cf gold from foreign
'â¢e/iifrp. while tt might constitute a rescun.<?
cgainin severe damage from money stringency
in the New York market, was by no moans
calculated to provide a redundancy of tur.Ji
here Fuch as might stimulate an unrivaled
er-fTJ'stibn. Whatever may be New York's
ability to <liaw en. foreign money markets, it
is b^iered that a period of considerably higher
rates for money is *till Inevitable between
now and the reriod when thÂ« movement of the
crop* â¢* compete. The Government's figures
of domestic exiwrts for August throw ccnirii*
trab'.e light on the commend of foreign credits
established, the exports of cotton amounting
to :;21.61G t*les, as compared with KG,SC2 in
AuKUft ot last year.
Tbe comparative jxiee of cotton between the
two perio-i* has berome odjufted almost to an
\u2666â¢quality ar.d the increase in value for thiÂ»
year's export has inereavd over $11.000,0A0.
With the increase In value of breadstuff*, prln

NEW YORK. Sept. 13.â COTTONâ To-day 1 s
rally was due. principally to covering of shorts,
a Jlttle better sup:K>rt from the bull clique,
report* of more unfavorable crop conditions
i in Texas r.nd better spot demand. The only
large holdings are contained -in the October
! and December options by: the Wall-street pool,
; end It is pretty well understood that the pool
is ful ficif-ntly strong to extend, and intends
\u25a0 to take up' whatever cotton may be tendered on
its October contracts. Advices from Liverpool
to-day were somewhat better than expected
which with the shorts covering caused prices
here to improve about 15 points. Europe gold
largely. There was a little new buying no

CHICAGO. Sept. IS.â Relief In a heavy

here to-day. At the close the December de
livery was off %Â©%c Corn is down i*@Vi".

5c to 12% c. , â¢ .
Sentiment In the wheat pit was rather bear
ish at the opening, the December option be
ing off a shade at S^?tc. The origin of the
easier undertone was a continuation of clear
weather In the Northwest. It was ' inferred (
that as a: result arrivals of new wheat from ;
the faimers would fee materially tncreaawlSS
Recei)its m-day at Minneapolis \u25a0 and Duluth ;
were fW7 cars, comparrd with 357 cars a yenr j
ago. Notwithstanding, however, that the day's i
receipts of; wheat at the Northwestern grain |
tenters were more than double the receipts \u25a0
of the ecrreffpnmiing day last year, the de
mand from miUei-8 to-Gay - was : reported *o \
urgent that all of to-day's arrivals' were I
nadlly dinposed of. ThiE fact-, temporarily j

Boon became quite firm. December advancing to j

from Canada tv the effect that the threshing |
returns from Manitoba showed an Increase in
ih* number of complaints regarding smaller;
yield.- A large majority or traders in theipit.
recurring to the Idea of Increased receipts i
Northweat. seemed eager to take advantage of '\u25a0\u25a0
the higher prices. The result was a quick
reaction. Part of the selling was attributed
to bearish European advice s. According to a I
prominent English crop statistician, ihe wheat
crop of France Is estimated at TCO.OOO.COO bush
els, compared with 2!12.0<:0,C0fi buFhels a year
bro. Reports fiom India asserted that the ;
wheat crop then- had been greatly benefited by j
heavy rains in . provlncÂ«3 where drouth had i
prevailed previously. For December the lo\y- \

RAISIN PEOPLE
SIGN THE PACT
Growers and Others Largely
Concerned in the Industry
Hold Important 3leeting
A meeting of great importance to all
the commercial interests connected with
the California raisin industry was held
yesterday in Fresno. Directors of the Cal
ifornia Raisin Growers' Company were
present and owners of packing-house
properties, representatives of bankers
arid ethers from this city took part in
the proceedings. The purpose, so said
Henry J. Crocker, president of the com
pany. was to sign important papers to
carry out an agreement.
The California Raisin Growers' Com
pany was organized some lime ago to
bring prosperity to the raisin industry
and the most important step was to take
.over the operation of the packing-houses.
Heretofore the raisin growers and pack
ers have not pulled together in all re
spects. Co-operation was found to .be
necessary to secure good prices and also
to have the raisins handled to the best
advantage. Henry J. Crocker was se
lected as president" of the company, as
the man best qualified by experience
and ability to head the concern.
A list of the packing-houses to be oper
ated by the California Raisin Growers'
Company indicates that the scope of the
business will be far reaching. The plants
are situated' in Fresno, Dinuba, Fowler,
Armona, Tulare, Los ' Palmas, Reedley,
Eelma and other places. The list is as
follows: ,

HIGHER POSITIO.V AWAITS
HETI'RX OF W, G. GARDINER
Report Saya He Will Be Made Anslstnnt
to PmteÃKer Traffic Mana
ger Cbarlett Fee.
It is common gossip In the Southern
Pacific Company's passenger depart
ment that the return from Chicago of
W. G. Gardiner, chief clerk to Passen
ger Manager Fee. will be followed by
his promotion to a higher position un
4er Mr. Fee.
Just what title -will be bestowed on
Gardiner is a matter of speculation, but
the general opinion is that he will be
either designated as assistant to the
passenger traffic manager or will be
made an assistant general passenger
egcnl and assume some of the responsi
bilities that General Passenger Agent
T. H. Goodman Is to lay aside on his re
tirement at the end of the month.
The purpose of the present trip to
Chicago of Passenger Traffic Manager
Fee and Chief Clerk Gardiner was gen
erally supposed to be in connection
with the coming meeting of the Trans
continental passe nger Association, but It
ts-Â«s learned yesterday that Ml 1 . Tee had
gone East to temporarily fill the posi
tion of assistant traffic director of the
Harriman lines during the absence of
K. O. McCormick abroad. Advices re
ceived here yesterday are to the effect
that Assistant Traffic Director McCor
rnlck will remain abroad about six
weeks, during which Charles Fee and
his chief clerk will remain in Chicago.
Fall to Identify EIHa.
Harry Foley, the retired pugilist, and
Mies Florence Hanley had a look at
William Ellis, alias Sampson, In the
City Prison yesterday morning, but
failed to identify him. although, both
said he resembled the man who at
tempted toehold Foley up. In Golden
Gate Park. Foley fl red four shots at
the footpad, who had a white handker
chief over his face. Ellis was wounded
In the shoulder by a bullet about the
time of the attempted hold-up, but he'
said he was driving in the park with
his wife and child when a stray bullet
struck him. Mrs. Ellis is still being
held Jn prison. Othrr men who. h:id
been held tip Sn the park will be asked
to have a look at Ellis.

J. D. SCHUYLER
CHANCES IDEAS
Admits Opinion Is Different
Xow Than When Writing
About Kansas City Case
The cross-examination of John D.
Schuyler, expert witness for the' Spring
Valley Water Company, was continued
yesterday afternoon in the office of
United States Commissioner E. H. Hea
cock. John S. Partridge, Republican
candidate for Mayor, represented the
city and confronted the witness with .i
paper prepared .by the latter and print
ed in the transactions of the American
Society of Civil Engineers, December,
1897, In which Schuyler's views are di
rectly adverse to those he advances
of the present time.~
Mr. Schuyler testified last Monday
that, in his opinion, the plant of the
company should be valued much higher
than the original cost, as the expense
of , establishing a similar plant would
be much larger and the engineering
features, such as laying pipes, much
harder. He also believed that the com
pany should be allowed rates on the
Increased value of its. property.
From his paper to the Engineers' So
ciety, where he expresses himself in
regard to the taking over of the Na
tional Water Works Company by.
Kansas. 'City, the following extracts
are taken:
The company having sought thÂ« franchise
and enjoyed the fruits of the exclusive privi
lege granted under it, should be content to sur
render it and retire from business when the
city elects to take advantage of Its option
and take over the plant on a valuation which
should be bseed, In the opinion of the writer,
upon the original cost, leas an amount to be
determined for depreciation, depending upon
the use- the plant has had. the age and condi
tion of the pipes, etc., and their probable term
of usefulness.
PEOI'LE SUPPLY, BUSINESS.
There may be some difficulty In arriving at
the exact first cost in case the company re
fuses to permit its books to be inspected, while
the' amount of depreciation Is a matter of
Judgment and expert opinion. That there
ehould be 'such deduction for depreciation can
not be questioned, as it would be manifestly
unfair to pay the amount of first cost for a
eecond-hand plant that had become obsolete,
at ler.st In some of its parts, and must have
cost more than it could be duplicated for
with new material throughout. In most cases
the coat of depreciation at the present i time
of any plant built Irom twenty to thirty years
ago. and added to from time to time to date,
would be lower than the first cost after de
ducting wear and tear and depreciation.
Is st not pertinent to inquire who furnished
this business? Is It not the prospective pur
chaser, in the case of the people acting
through their City Council, and why should
they be asked to purchase a business which
they themselves supply? This might be a good
argument and a proper basis for ' figuring in
case of a proposed transfer from one water
company to another, but it surely has no
weight when the people seek to manage their
own business affairs. They do not need to
purchase their own good will, and . ought not
to be asked to pay for the business which sup
p'.jing their own wants affords.^
When the city of Portland, Ore., acquired
j the plant of the City Water Company, In 1886,
the company valued the works -at- about
$900,000, while the water oommittee'Â» esti
mate of duplicating the plant wai - about
$:'..jO.CCO. After much negotiation, covering
nearly a year's time, and after t^ie committee
had begun .work on a new plant to parallel the
old one, a compromise was finally effected and
the works were purchased at $464,550. '
PIIOFIT AT HALF RATES.
The committee Immediately cut the rates In'
half, and the first year cleared $50,502 over all
<il>cratlrtf: exoenses. Had the rate been un
changed the net revenue would have been suf
ficient to pay 5 per cent interest on nearly
$.{.COO,CCO. Had the business been taken into
consideration in this case, as suggested by the
author, and the plant valued upon Its capital
ized value as an \ Interest-paying institution,
the city would have been called upon to pay
nearly nine times the cost of duplicating the
eld works; or had the j value been determined
by capitalizing ktobs earnings, after deduct
ing operating and maintenance expenses, ac
cording to the method which Is evidently pre
ferred by the author, the valuation would have
been ?1,â¬12.000, nearly double the greatest sum
asked by Uie water company, or four and a
half times the cost of duplication. -
Under the cross-examination by. Mr.
Partridge, the witness was made to ad
mit that he had changed . his opinion
since the paper referred to -had been
written, although he maintained that
there. was a, difference between the two
cases, as in : one the system was 'to be
taken over by the city, while In the
other it was only desired to establish
rates.. V \u2666".."'/. \u25a0 . . .

YOUNG CROCKER
"HIS OWN BOSS"
Last of the Heirs to For
tune Made in Railroad
Is Given JLis Property
The last heir to the Crocker estate came
to his own yesterday, receiving $5,000,000.
Charles Templeton Crocker Is his name,
and he is at present a sophomore at Yale.
The fact that his guardians, Henry T.
Scott and Charles E. Green, were to ren
der a final accounting before Judge Cof J
fey yesterday .had not been announced,
but when the news flew around the City
Hall that $5,000,000 was to be turned over
a crowd of the curious rushed to the
courtroom. The fortunate young man is
a serious, scholarly looking fellow. He Is
tall, fair-haired arid blue-eyed,- with a
hijh, intellectual forehead.
When he walked into the courtroom be
tween Henry T. Scott and Charles E.
Green nobody would have taken the
quiet, unassuming young man for. the heir
to millions. His apparel was very mod
est, a "pepper and salt" suit and a straw
hat.
The estate left by Colonel Charles
Crocker was originally valued at $8,000,000.
Since the time of his death in 1597 the
property has increased much in value.
It is now worth over $15,000,000.
The eldest child, Mary Crocker, now
Mrs. Francis Burton Harrison, was given
charge of her portion several years ago;
She got about ..$4,000,000. Miss Jennie
Crocker's share was turned over to her
about six months ago. Charles Templeton
Crocker came of age on September 3.
The court proceedings were short. Judge
CofCey asked young -Crocker if he was
satisfied with, the accounting. Prince
Fortunatiis expressed himself very well
pleased with It. The Judge glanced over
the papers In the case and said that, he
would be pleased to release the guardians.
' Henry T. Scott and; Charles. E. Green
were allowed $12,500 each for trfcir work.
Attorney Morrison was granted a fee of
$5000. . : ;-.
Young Crocker was told that he j would
have to go through the form of becoming
a resident of the State. He promised to
register at San Mateo before leaving for
the East." . .
The property into which the young man
came into possession consists of shares in
the St. Francis Hotel, . the Shreve build-
Ing, the Crocker Estate Company, and the
News Company building. ..
- The original estate was accumulated in
railway deals by Charles Crocker, who,
with Collls P. Huntlngton,' Leland Stan
ford and Timothy Hopkins, built the
Southern Pacific Railroad. y. ""\u25a0

FAIL TO ATTEND
BOARD MEETING
Supervisors Ignore Invita
tion to Confer on Con
struction of Schoolhouses
MORE TALK INDULGED IX
Bids to Be Opened Will De
termine if Plans Will Be
Reduced to Meet Condition
The ' attempt of - the Board of Public
Works to "establish peace with the Demo
cratic majority of the Board of Super
visors relative to the, building of school
houses under the bond issue came to
naught yesterday. The invitation to . the
Pnblio Utilities and Finance committees
to attend the conference was ignored, the
only member present being | Supervisor
Bent. .
It was stated at the outset that new
bids for the Washington Grammar School
under modified plans would be opened on
September 30, but that 'it was not thought
the bids would vary from those previous
ly : filed, which range from $215,000 to
$250,000, whereas only $119,000 is available.
Commissioner Eagan took issue with
Supervisor Braunhart, : who said at last
Monday's meeting that the Washington
school Building could be built for $119,000.
Eagan said the Supervisors had bought
school sites . at prices in excess of the
bond provisions, and the same thing could
be done where the cost of the buildings
is in excess of the appropriation. Eagan
said it was up to the Supervisors to pro
vide . the necessary relief or the erection
or. the buildings would be blocked.
' CHARTER IS DEFECTIVE.
President Roncovieri of the Board of
Education called attention to a defect tn
the charter which , does not allow partial
or. progressive payments "on public conr
tracts, necessarily increasing the cost of
the building. The contractor is obliged
to borrow money with which to'buy his
material and engage his labor,' upon
which he must pay interest, said Ronco
vieri, who figured that but 63 per cent of
the appropriation is actually available to
"construct the building after the Interest
and increases in prices of . material and
labor since the estimates were first made
are considered. Roncovieri said that ex-
City Engineer Grunsky had made a rough
estimate of $6000 for each, room, but that
& model school had other" features be
sides rooms, such as gymnasiums and as
sembly halls. â â¢
The board decided that nothing could
be done without the co-operation of the
Supervisors, and it would be well to await
the receipt of bids next Wednesday after
noon, to which time the meeting ad
journed. If the bids exceed the money
available the plans will be reduced to the
bare details io come within the estimate
of $119,000. . â¢
SUPERVISORS CRITICIZED.
The Board of Works also took occasion
to criticize the Board of Supervisors for
making inadequate appropriations for
various improvements. .
A petition of property owners was read
requesting. that the $15,000 appropriated to
construct a sewer in York street, between
Army and Twenty-sixth, to eradicate the
Precita Valley swamp, be utilized at once.
City Engineer Woodward stated that the
appropriation would, be sufficient only- to
purchase the necessary land for the right
of way. The entire; cost of the improve
ment * would approximate $45,000, said
Woodward, who was directed to prepare
a report on the matter..-' . \u25a0
The board asked the Supervisors for au
thority to construct a convenience station
south of Market street, for, which $7500
was appropriated. i.Woodward said the
amount waa insufficient, and the $15,000
set aside by the Supervisors for a new
bridge at Mount Vernon and San Jose
avenues Is also inadequate.
"Let us ask for authority to go ahead
with the work,'" . said Commissioner
Aigeltinger, "in order to show how non
sensical the Supervisors were in mailing
their estimates."
Frank Sheerin was given the contract
to repair the San Bruno road at . Â»5 cents
per yard. . .
The board ordered the construction of a
sewer in Tenth avenue, between A arid
Fulton streets, to drain the conduits of
the proposed Geary street road. : _
Louis Mechan, watchman at the City
Hall -and Daniel \ O'Neill, watchman at
the Fourth , street bridge, were directed
to exchange positions. - â¢ \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0_\u25a0^
. The board approved a deed from ;the
John Brickell Company to j lands for the
opening of " Twenty-fifth avenue from
Lake to West Clay, streets.-;

IS VAEIETY ACTEESS
Makes Naive Confession and
Is Informed That She
Has Spoiled Her fchance
"Yes, my husband and I talked it over
and decided that we would get a di
vorce," was the naive admission made
to , Judge Graham yesterday by Esther
R. Hughes, actress at the Lyceum
Theater.
I -"That's just the one reason why you
cannot have a divorce,'^, said Judge Gra
ham. Mrs. Hughes looked surprised.
"Why, we both want one," '; she said.
The "Judge read the lady a few points
on divorce law, showing her that a mu
tual agreement to separate by husband
and wife prevented the granting of a
decree. The lady then appeared sorry she
had spoken. She-asked for a divorce
from Garfleld R. Hughes on the ground
of desertion. '"Yes, he deserted me," she
declared, " DU t J l met niln a nionth ago
and we t decided to get divorced."
John Wakowski, who testified before
Judge Graham that his wife was in the
habit of .' beating ; him with an autsmV
bile wrench, was granted a divorce on the
ground of cruelty: > It was,a case. of get
ting, rid of ; the wife or the auto and
Wakowski decided to keep the benzine
buggy.. ,
Other divorces were granted as follows:
Andrew; Smith \u25a0 from Dlna Smith, deser
tion; Lena- Lambert from John Lambert,
desertion; "Alice W." Stanley from Joseph
T. Stanley, desertion, and â¢ Frances Ann
Werner from Frank Werner, cruelty.
/'Anita Zanone : alleges ;-; that her hus
band,' Paul Zanone, poured muriatic acid
over, her tailor-made suit, thereby caus
ing her great mental anguish. ! This Jis
one lof the extreme cruelties charged In
her suit for divorce. \u25a0,
Richard Driscoll, who declares that his
wife, Emma Drlacoll, was In the habit of
frequently challenging him "to fight like
a man," wants a divorce on the ground
of cruelty. He charges that his wife
beat him whenever she felt in need of ex
ercise.
Other divorce suits were filed as fol
lows: Belle Heynemann- against David
H. Heynemann, ; failure to provide; Kath
erlne Thomas against Albert M. Thomas,

ISAAC FINDS
MEXICAN PEST
Six States of Country Are
Known to Be Infested
With Enemy ,of Orange
John Isaac, after acting as represen
tative for California in -a conference with
the horticultural authorities of . Mexico,
has just reported that he has discovered
that cix and perhaps more States in
Mexico are harboring, a foe of oranges
which this State has reason to dread if
it should be permitted to enter Cali
fornia.
Mr. Isaac was . sent to Mexico because
the southern republic protested against
the exclusion of Mexican oranges from
California. He made the trip south un-.
der instructions from Horticultural Com
missioner Ellwood Cooper. He reports
that he found that thousands of oranges
and mangoes have been destroyed within
three months by the Mexicans in an at
tempt to eradicate the orange "maggot,
which has occasioned much damage.
The orange ' maggot proceeds from the
eggs of the insect. known as the trypeta
ludens. The. fecundity of this insect is
something astonishing. A written state
ment made by Professor Herrera of Mex
ico is quoted by Mr. Isaac in his report,
that the defendants , of 3000 larvae at
1 the 1 fourth generation, or within one
year, number 4,500,000,000 In round figures.
In Mr. Isaac's report Is also included
a statement by Professor Herrera, which
would seem to indicate that the Mexl
> cans do not object to sending their orange
pest abroad. An extract from Herre
ra's statement is as follows:
One great circumstance which prerents the
plague from spreading Is the fact that the
greater . part of the wormy fruit Is exported
to distant places, where, for many reasons.
It cannot transform from the larva and per
ishes : bof ore It reaches the perfect stage. But
should it happen . some year that exportation
wen suspended on account of Increase of duty
or by an , Interruption in the \u25a0 means of com
munication, then It might happen that all of
the fruit , ;ln. the State ,of Morelos would be
attacked and also that of the Immediate States.
and not only would the orange be lost, but
also' the mango, guava and , other wild and
cultivated- fruits. .'Thus th* descendants of
SSUO larvae, received at this oftlce and- pre
served In alcohol would be sufficient to Infest
1,020,377,000 oranges, allowing five larvae to
each orange.
What Is deduced' from*, tnese calculations la
that were the plague exterminated in any lo
cality, and but a single pair of Insects had
been \u25a0 overlooked, this would be sufficient to
rapidly Infest the country again.
\u25a0 Mr. Isaac reports that from the inves
tigations 'â¢ made . and the best information
obtainable," it appears that \u25a0 the pest ex
ists in the States of Guerrero, Morelos,
Oaxaca, Tabasco, Tamaullpas and-Vera
Cruz, and, quite probably, also, in Cam
peachy, Tlaxacala and Yucatan. It may
also exist in some portions of Jalisco,
Puebla and Tepic, although it has not
been reported from these States. The
other. Mexican States are so far : appar
ently free : from the pest. The infested
sectioa fr6m which California would have
most v 'to fear is the State of Guerrero,
as its port of Acapulco is Is one of the
principal shipping -points In Mexico, and
there /is i continuous intercommunication
between it and California points.

That California is still: thought of by

comes from a>r>rominent architect in
Brussels and contains along array of
questions in regard to California. The
inquirer asks whether he will be forced
to ""defend L himself "against the at
