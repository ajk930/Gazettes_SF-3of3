Strange Features of a
Divorce Action in
Society. Couple Agree to Sep
arate With No Element
of Bitterness.
Special Dispatch to The' Call.
CHICAGO, Oct. 24.-A prospective di
vorce, which satisfies all parties â¢ con
cerned; mutual admiration, but not love;
separation without estrangement; a con
tinuance of friendliness and the absolute
approval of the wife's parentsâ these ap
pear to be the salient points in the case
of -Dr. and Mrs. Joseph W. Wassail.
Mrs. Wassail has determined to insti
tute procedings for an absolute divorce,
but no element of bitterness is said to
enter into the matter. According to her
own statements the impelling causes are
twoâ the discovery by husband and wife
that they do not lore one another and
the seductive charms of Mrs. Wassail's
artâ music. . .
Here is the- power of music exemplified
strikingly. It separates a young and
charming woman from a handsome and
wealthy husband, from a home, of luxury,
and, strangest of all, perhaps, from . her
two little children- : . " . - â¢
.The couple" involved . in this "strange
separation -do not look upon it as a trage
dy. To them it is merely, a mutual ar
rangement. â¢ tarried out-.' ajp* \u25a0coolly \u25a0 taiS"
deliberately as a real estate transac
tion and designed to promote the happi
ness . and welfare of all concerned.
The children are to reside alternately'
with either parent; the wife Is to call
upon her husband and the husband is
to call upon his wife when so inclined;
the ' father-in-law . will remain a close
"chum" of the "son-in-law and everything
is to be harmony, quite in consonance
with the correct interpretation of Mrs.
Wassail's art. Toner mother. Mrs. W. S.
Crosby, at her residence. , Mrs. Wassail
said to-day, after she. learned that the
public had obtained an inkling of her
plans: .
'.'We thought we loved. Long ago we
found we did " not. You must have seen
It, , mother, and many others must - have
observed it. Little did I know that -my
devotion tojnusic would ultimately de
velop into an all-consuming force."
Mrs. Crosby sSsld to a reporter:
"I fall to find any especially pathetic
side to this affair. Every one is sat
isfied. No one will suffer. Divorce pro
ceedings will : soon be instituted, but the
children, Ellen, aged 12. ana Joseph, aged
4. will have their father and mother
equally as much as ever before. No man
has been and will remain to be more wel
come In our home that Dr. Wassail. He
will bring the children here at times, and
when they make their home with us.
as they will at Intervals, their mother
will go calling at their father's home."
Mr. Crosby, a Board of Trade man,
silently nodding approval of g his wife's
statements, concluded the interview by
saying:
"Dr. Wassail is my inseparable chum.
We will remain chums until death sep
arates us."

MADRID, Oct. 24. â The Senators and
Deputies favorable to the establish
ment of a Spanish republic, having
been forbidden personally to address
President Loubet, who arrived here
yesterday, have published an address
of welcome which in reality Is a mani

mede against traditions. Republican Franck
represents the freedom . gained by revolution
and It Is toward the same end that, Spain
tends.
The address closes with "Vive la Re

CHICAGO, Oct. 24. â Fearing au acci

Roosevelt and her associates as well as
himself and his companions, K. H. Har
riman to-day ordered the driver of the
special train which is bearing them
across the continent to check the rec
ord-breaking speed which was begun
at San Francisco. From sixty miles an
hour the pace was cut to . thirty-nine

advised, him: against the: high, iate- of

Kruttsehnltt^- telegraphed to W. A.
Worthington, his assistant in Chicago,
that , the. original schedule had Geeu
abandoned. .-' ' ' \u25a0
Harriman issued an order to decrease
the speed just after he had gone through
Winnemucea, Nevada. His train was
then traveling at the rate of sixty miles
an hour. A pilot locomotive was running
ahead to test the track and all switches
had been spiked down. -
The official's of the Northwestern Rail
road to-night received a telegram . from
Kruttsehnltt, , asking them to pick up
the Harriman special at Omaha at half
past seven o'clock to-morrow morning.
Chicago will be reached in forty-eight
hours and forty-five, minutes at least
from the time of leaving San Francisco,
an average speed" of about 43 j
miles an hour... Neither the Lake Shore,
Northwestern, nor. Erie officials have re
ceived any word to change fast sched
ules they \u25a0 had arranged j for the train.
The Northwestern will bring* the special
to Chicago from Omaha In ten houra and
forty-five minutes. â¢ . \u25a0 â¢
CHEYENNE. Wyo. Oct. 24.-After
breaking all records for. fast, time from
San Francisco to Ogden, .something haÂ»
happened the E. H. Harriman special, for
a new schedule has been put' out and the
train is making slower time over \u25a0â¢ertain
divisions than was originally planned.
Railroad officials will not talk until the
train reaches j Cheyenne.
It Is reported that President Roosevelt,
fearing for the safety of his daughter
Alice, requested that she leave the train
or that slower time.be made. \u25a0â¢The" story
cannot be confirmed. Another report
states that. owing to the, unexpected slow
time in Western Wyoming Harriman saw
that he could not malntain^an average
speed of a mile a minute, which lie had
cut out for himself, and abandoned the
maddening race.
It is certain, however, that no accident
has befallen the train since leaving Og
den. The Harriman ' flier left Ogden- at
11:30 a. m. Over seventy-six oniles to
Evanstoh was covered In slow time, ow
ing to. the .heavy grades in v Echo : and
Weber canyons. From Evanston to Green
River .better time was made, the train
frequently attaining a speed of sixty-five
and seventy, miles an hour. 'From Green
River ' to Rawllns t he '{ best time *of { the
trip was made;, the 134 miles being covered
In 158 minutes, including, stops. . The train
left : Rawllns at -6:37 'to-night after
a stop of, ten ; minutes, during" which
engines were' changed and President Har
riman conferred ; with ; General Manager
Mohler, who is en;route West, regarding
I extensions in .Wyoming.,
The original' schedule time for the Har
' riman j train i -through Wyoming â¢called for
? an average speed- of .fifty-five 'miles per
hour, but between Ogden "and j j Rawlins
the train fell slightly below an. average
speed of! forty-five miles an; hour," Includ-,
ing stops. The 'loss of over ten miles

If tales told by him to a man who w,a3
convicted as one of hia accomplices In one
crime are true, James W. Finley, the
convict who was so badly wounded in
the Folsom prison-break of last Decem
ber and who Is now In the Sacramento
County Jail. Is the perpetrator of sev
eral daring crimes, the authorship of
which was nevr discovered by the. law
officers of the various parts ot the Stata
where they were committed, though every
effort was made to ferret out the guilty
man or. men- It was to Charles N. Ste
phens, alias Jones, who was convicted
6f^ halving helped planthe killing of Frank
"L^" Crake" at"^Hohow" "Tree," or Monroe,
in MendocimT County, that Flnley made
his 'statements regarding the crimes he
had committed.
.'-Drake was a lumberman and had saved
$300. Finley went to his cabin at night
to rob him and shot him dead when hÂ«
showed signs of resistance. Stephens and
W". H. Owens were ' convicted, on the
testimony of Mrs. May Ottie and her
daughter, named Ketchings. with whom
the two men were living, of having
planned the murder and robbery with
Finley. Both are now at San Quentin
prison, serving life sentences. Stephen*
was brought to the prison on Sunday by
Sheriff Smith of Uklah. On the way ho
told the Sheriff all ab-jut Flnley's state
ments. '
According to Finley's stories, he held
up the Bartlett stage twice, -robbed a
saloon-keeper in a small place in Mendiv
cino'County of $1500, helped rob the Pied
mont car barn In Oakland, when the
ntght watchman was shot: killed a mes
serfger named Overmeyer ' near Ukiah
three years ago. held up several per
sons in a saloon in the Fresno, moun
tains, held up street-car conductors in
Los Angeles. â¢ robbed a faro bank at sonyÂ»
county fair and committed numerous
other crimes before finally getting hla
deserts when he robbed and killed Drake.
He also planned the robbery of a lum
ber company's paymaster, Stephens says.
COFESSKS STAGE ROBBERIES.
Warden TompkJns drew much mom
from Stephens at San Quentin prison
yesterday. The yining man did not seem
desirous of concealing anything Finley
had told him. but he did not remember
full details In any of the cases. It de
veloped that he first mrt Finley through
taking, up a quarter section of timber
land at the -request of the latter, this
land to be -sold to timber grabbers who
had employed Finley to locate for them.

roll money to the lumber camps. He was
to do this job this summer, but his arrest
for the killing of lirake prevented him.
The company's practice was to send the
money, they paid off in cash then, to Cor
bell, and from there the paymaster took
it to the logging camps on a spfcial en
gine on the extension road. There was
usually *_0,000 or $30,0J0 sent up each
month. . . . . .
"No. h* didn't talk so much about de
railing or flagging the engine. His
scheme was to disguise himself as a de
tective and ask permission to ride on the
e::gine to the camps, on the pretense that
there was a man there.he wanted, and to
hold tip the paymaster on the way. Only
the engineer and the fireman went with
the paymaster. I told Finley I would
have nothing: to do with this, "as crime
didn't pay."
In reply to a question by Warden
Tompklns. Stephens said Finley seemed
to be telling of his crimes to let him
know how safe and profitable such work
was, so as to induce him to join with
him.
"I believe that most of what Finley
told me was true," said Stephens.

The Bartlett Springs stage was held up
by a lone highwayman almost on top of
the grade on July 20. 1903, and again by
a- lone highwayman on July 6 of the fol
lowing year near the. top of the Brim
prade. In the first robbery $200 was ob
tained and in the second 5250.. The officers
were convinced from the similarity of the
highwayman's actions on both occasions
that one man committed both robberies.

Fearing the Effect of Its

Takes Up Long-Xeglected
Work of Purifying* Milk
RAGAN OX EECOED
WITH : AX ARREST
-Â»
Catches Dairyman With a
Filthy Wagon, Who Had
Convenient Can of Water
Stacked in Wagon Rack
In an effort 1 to relieve Itself of some of
the stigma that accrues from the mal
administration of municipal affairs in San
Francisco, and compelled to take notice
of the children whose lives have been
imperiled, the official guardians of the
health and sanitation of ihe city have be
come busy.
They have been aroused, however spas
modic the move may be, to the cry of
anxious mothers for pure milk for their
babes. They have awakened from a
dormant neglect of this problem that ap
peals with such* tremendous force to
every household. On the eve of the
struggle between clean men and grafters
the Health Department adjunct has been
forced to an activity which is in such
marked contrast to the months of leth
argy that the attempt of the board to
retrieve itself would be ludicrous if the
subject were not of such serious import.
Officials who have been blind. ; for
months to the fact that 300 dairies are
pouring their product into the city under
any sort of conditions have of a sudden
become argus-eyed in their search, after
contaminated milk. Officials who have
permitted a laxity in the inspection of
dairies and their products which is with
out excuse have let day run Into night
and night into day without relaxing* their
pursuit of bacilli-laden milk. And all
of this comes from the protest of a father
who sternly invoked on his own account
the law against a dairyman whose
poisoned milk had brought a serious ill
ness upon two Innocent, helpless children.
It was through no official action on the
part of the Health Board or any of its
employers that George C ' Smart, pro
prietor of the New York' Dairy, was
brought to book for \u25a0â¢ selling milk thai
contained deadly formaldehyde^ a drug
used for embalming anatomical speci
mens In the medical world. Indeed the
Health Department has been forced to
admit no formaldehyde was ever found
In Smart's milk by its force. The reason.
Is that the records of the Health Office
show: that no test of milk from Smart's
dairy : was made during the first six
months ;of this year.
The case of Eugene Lent's children,
whose illness resulted in Smart's arrest,
was not the only one. Little Edith Hey
of 1334 Turk street, a baby only sixteen
months old,' drank drugged milk and for
many days hovered between life and
death. The Pryal children of 2711 A Sutter
street were in the same plight. To the
Board of Health yesterday went a citizen
who withheld his name denouncing the
San Mateo Dairy as responsible forjthe
critical Illness twice of his Infant. And
thus the list of the Innocents growÃ as
the indignation of parents increases. . <
Tn the midst of It aIL with the jock
eying of warrants of arrest of dairy
men, with the explanations that do
not explain, a w r ail goes up from the
Health Office.
SCH-HITZ MAX I.AMKXTS.
â¢ "This kick about milk ain't doing
Schmitz any goÂ°6\" complained a
Health Board employe yesterday.
When the Inquiry was -made why milk
had been sidetracked In the depart
ment the answer was:
"We have been very busy testing
olive oil. and we have got some mag
nificent results."
The comparative values of pure milk
as a steady diet for babies and pure
olive oil form another chapter for elu
cidation by supine health officials.
But Health Officer Ragan protests
that his department Is at work. For
proof he recites his own experience yes
terday morning with a milkman. Ra
gan observed E. H. Arnold of Cinna
mon street and University avenue
driving a milk-laden wagon along
Folsom street, near Seventh, that was
bo nasty as to attract even Ragan's at
tention. Imbued with the awakened
spirit of the day, the Haelth Officer
stopped Arnold. Ragan demanded that
the dairymen should go to the City
Hall.
"Who are you?" curtly queried Ar
nold.
"I am the Health Officer," said Ragan.
"Where's your, badge?" demanded the
driver.
"Never mind the badge," announced
the vigilant doctor, "you come with
me."
But Arnold was not so minded. In
stead he whipped up his team and
headed out Folsom street- Ragan, filled
â¢with official zeal, followed until he
found a policeman, who arrested the
fugitive dairyman - at Seventeenth
street. To the City Hall they repaired.
There Arnold's cans were examined and
one of them contained water. \
"What do -you use that for?" de
xnanded the officers."
'"For drinking purposes when I am
thirsty." Arnold replied, and ,he did
not blink an eyelid.
Arnold was arrested on a charge of
having carried milk in a wagon - con
taining refuse that might contaminate.
City Chemist Glbbs {ook samples of the
milk and swabs from the cans and bot
tles. These will be analyzed, and if
adulterants or poisonous matter is
found Arnold will be prosecuted on
other charces. The can of water was
given Into the charge of the police as
evidence. Arnold holds dairy permit
No. BS, which was Issued several years
Ago to Arnold & Kenerson.
RECORDS ARK AWRY.
This experience opened a new field
for rehabilitation of conditions at the
Health Office. Ragan ordered notices
sent to all dairymen and milk. dealers
to apply for a reissue of their permits.
The records of the department in this
particular have not been properly kept
up. . They have become so ' unreliable
that many dairies are being conducted
under permits Issued long ago to own
ers long since out of business.
It was found that in many cases the
firm names under which the original
permits, had been issued were retained
on the office books, though the dairies
had passed Into other hands. In order
that the records may show who arc
the actual owners and that permits
may- be revoked In teasest cases where, the
pure miik.laW' has been violated,' there
will be a renovation of the records. '..
Dr. Ragan protests, that the exami
nation.of dairies will continue and that
he will try'to purify the milk stinoiv.

ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 24.â The gov
ernment resumed railroad service on a
few roads to-day, . but under great diffi
culty. The decision of the railroad men
at a meeting here to-night to declare a
general strike has immensely compli
cated the problem. Trains le^t for Mos
cow to-day over the Nicolai road, but the
passengers were notified that communi
cation was guaranteed only as far as
Tver! *
Several attempts were made to-day to
interrupt communication by telegraph
and telephone out of Moscow and the
telegraph offices had to be guarded by
Cossacks. Persons wishing to send mes
sages had to fight their way through
crowds of strikers and in many' cases
were severely handled. '\u25a0'.:\u25a0\u25a0.
The strike has taken a violent turn
in a number of cities, from which ' re
ports come of encounters between mobs
and the police and troops. - s . -1 *';
Agrarian disorders have broken out in
the province of Samarau.
The executive committee of the League

KHARKHOPF, Russia, Oct. 21.â A bo
rious conflict between the troops and
the people, during which there were many
casualties on both sides,^occurred here
last night. While a meeting of 20,000
citizens, students and workmen wwars r in
progress the cry "The Cossacks are com
ing" was suddenly raised and a panic fol
lowed. Many persons were injured in the
crush. Subsequently the crowd came into
contact \u25a0;, with a detachment of cavalry.
Revolyer;Â«hdti>TÂ«rereiflred by, some of. the
civilians 4 " and* small bombs were hurled
among the cavalry. The latter thereupon
fired two volleys with blank ; cartridges and
then flred with bullets. Both sides suf
fered seriously. Many of the wounded
were left on the ground when the crowd
dispersed. Â« "
The strikers have since plundered the
gunsmith stores and have armed them
selves. A number of bakeries have been
destroyed and all work has been stopped
at others. Scarcity of the necessities of
life is already felt here.
LODZ, Oct. 24.â The employes of seven
factories struck' to-day. There are now
38,000 workmen on strike.
But he complains that the imposing of
fines of $25 in cases of conviction is a.
detriment to his work. Ragan desires
offending dairymen punished by the
maximum fine of $500.
The State Dairy Bureau again came
to the rescue of the Health Office yes
terday by causing a warrant to issue
out of Police Judge Fritz' court for the
arrest of C. N. Johnson, a dairyman,
charged by W. R. Freeman, a State
dairy inspector, with adulterating
cream with boron and failing: to so
label his. product.
Milk Inspector T. P. Lydon swore to
a complaint charging Shafer & Green,
dairymen, with sophisticating cream
with coal tar dye. \

with selling milk deficient In butter
fat, was arrested. He gave $50 ball.
3IAKE RAIDS ON WAGONS.
Dr. William C. Hassler. Chief Sani
tary Inspector, has mapped out a pro
gramme for a general collection of milk
samples from all of the dairies which
supply San Francisco. Following > his
seizure of samples from' the shipments
arriving at water front points and the
Southern Pacific station at Third and
Townsend streets, the milk coming
In wagons from dairies south of the
city was sampled last night. Inspectors
were stationed below Sunnyside and on
the San Bruno road, where; each In
bound wagon was stopped,. and sam
ples were taken from bottles and cans.
These were turned over to the City
Chemist for analysis. " During the early
hÂ«purs yesterday mornlngr- inspectors
took samples from seventeen wagons
on delivery in various parts of the city.
In all cases where adulterants are
found the dairymen will be arrested.
The effect of publicity has been noticed
in a compliance by j dairymen with the
State law, which directs all cream or
milk adulterated with boron to be thus
labeled. More than 5000 gallons ; of
cream that arrived last night was
marked as requlredby the statute.
John Kelly, proprietor of the^Del
MOnte Ranch Dairy, who handles milk
from the model, dairy of R. M. Hotal
ingy yesterday voluntarily offered him
self up: for, : arrest to^jlealth Officer
Ragan because he claims that the milk
cannot be made to pass the standard of
3.2 per. cent of butter fat required' by
the ordinance. Kelly explained that the
milk. given by the Holstein cows- owned
by Hotaling could not rise above" 2.9
per cent in butter fat, no matter what
they were fed on or, what 'precautions
were taken. .
-Kelly said he wanted to be arrested
In.'- order to test the validity of. the
ordinance requiring. a'; higher standard."
Ragan 'said that Hotalirig's dairy was
a model one in -every respect, ; but -he
declined to accept the : challenge be

BIRMINGHAM, Ala.. Oct. 24.âPresi
dent Roosevelt concluded a strenuous day
in Alabama with a two hours' visit to
Birmingham, where his reception, iin
keeping with those given him at Mont
gomery and Tuskegee, was hearty and
soul-stirring. His day began at 7 o'clock
this morning, when the special left Mont
gomery for Tuskegee. Visits to the Tus
kegee Normal and to the Methodist fe
male; college were crowded into a litle
less than two hours, and the noon hour
had just arrived when the 'executive
stepped from his car, in Montgomery.
There he spoke to a great throng under
the* shadow 'of the Confederacy's first
capitol and was on his way again at 2
o'clock. A' few minutes before 5 o'clock
the- President was the guest of Birming
ham and until his train left at 6:45 p. m.
"on the night run to Little Rock the Pres

arrested.
Mayor Ward -made the formal address
of welcome at the station here and im
mediately afterward the party entered
carriages and began the march to Capi
tol Park, eight squares distant. The en
tire line of march was packed wit^ peo
ple. The ovation was continuous and
the President stood in his carriage the
entire distance, acknowledging the out
burst of enthusiasm. Capitol Park was
brilliantly lighted.
The party entered the speakers' stand
and great applause greeted the President
as^he arose to speak. He began by
speaking of Alabama's wonderful recov
ery from the Vdesolation of the war and
[referred to the State's great natural re
sources. He continued:
j My friends, there 1b something that Is ahead
of any kind of natural resources and that

The President was received by Princi
pal Booker T. Washington and members
of' the faculty and by the institute
Board of Trustees. He then entered a

In \u25a0: the Ntorth; \u25a0 Your fifteen hundred students
are not only being educated in head and
heart, but also trained to industrial efficiency,
for from the beginning Tuskegee has placed
especial emphasis upon the training of men
and women \ln - agriculture, mechanics and
household . duties. -Training in these three
fundamental \u25a0 directions does . not embrace all
that -the negro or any other race needs, but
it does cover In a very large degree the fltld
In which the negro can at present do most for.
himself and be most helpful to his white
neighbors. \u25a0 -\u25a0 .-.â¢\u25a0:\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 â¢ "
tvery black man who leaves this institution
is better able to do mechanical or -industrial
work and adds by so much .to the " wealth of
the community and benefits all people in the
community. The professional and mercantile
avenuts to success are overcrowded; for the
present the best : chance of success awaits the
Intelligent I worker at some mechanical trade
or on & farm; for this man will almost cer
tainly achieve Industrial independence.
I am pleased, but not thÂ» ieast surprised,
to learn that many among the women ana
men trained at Tu&kegee find Immediate em
ployment as leaders and workers among "tnelr
own j people and that their services are gen
erally sought by white people for vanou*
kinds of Industrial work, tha demand be.ng
much greater than the supply. Viewed from
any angle Ignorance is the costliest crop that
can be raised In any part . of this Union,
Every do.lar put into the education of eithex
white man or black -man, in head, 1n hancu
and in heart, yields rich dividends to thÂ»
entire community. '
Merely from the economic standpoint It Is
of the utmost consequence to alt oar citizen*
that institutions such as this at Tuskegee
should be a success.* But there are other and
even higher reasons " that entitle it to ouz
support. In the interest of humanity. o! jus
tice and of self -protection every white man lit
America, no matter where he lives should
try to help the negro to help hlmaelf. It i*
in the Interest and for the protection of thÂ»
white man to see that the negro is educated.
It is not only, the duty of the white man
but It Is to his. interest to see that the negro
is protected in' propery, in life and In alt
his legal rights. Every time a law Is broke*
every individual in the community has the
moral tone of his life lowered. â¢ Lawlessness
In the United States is not confined to anj
one section; lynching Is not confined to anj
one section and there . Is perhaps no body oi
American citizens who have deserved ' so well
of the entire American people as the publlt
men. the publicists, the clergymen, the count
less thousands of htgh-mtnded private citizen*
who have done such heroic work in the Soutn
in arousing public opinion against lawlessness
in all its forms and especially against lynch
lnjr. I very earnestly hope that their example
will count in ; the North as well as in thft
South, for there are Just as great evils to t*
warred against In one region of our country
as In another, though they are not in all
places the same evils. '
I heartily appreciate what you have donÂ«
at Tuskegee and I am sure you will not
grudge my,, saying that It could not possibly
have been. done save for the loyal suÂ»Dort
you have received from the white people round
about, for during -i;he twenty-five years ot
effort . to educate the black man here â¢In thÂ»
midst of a. white community of . Intelligence
and culture there has never bÂ»en an outbreak,
between the â¢ races or any "difficulty of anj
kind. ; All honor Is -due to. the white men- of
Alabama, to - the white . men of Tuskegee fot
what they have done. \u25a0 And right here let
me say that If any community misunderstand
ing '- between \u25a0 the races arises over an; mat
ter. infinitely the best way out is to have a
prompt, ! frank and full conference and . con
sultation between representatives of the wise,
cool-headed men among the whites and trio
wise. \u25a0 decnt, cool-headed colored men. Such
a conference will always tend to bring about
a - better jj understanding and will be a great
help all around.
Hitherto I'have spoken chiefly of- the obli
gations existing on the part of the white man.
Now remember, on the other hiftid, that no
help can-permanently avail you save as you
yourselves develop for self-help. You young
colored men and women educated at Tuskepee
must by precept and example lead your fel
lows toward sober, | industrious, I law-abiding
lives. You are In honor bound to Join hands
in enforcing the laws and to war against
all. crimes'- and \u25a0 especially against crime by
men of your ! own .race, for the heaviest
wrong done, by â¢ the \u25a0 criminal , Is the , wrong
to his own . race. You must teach the people
of your race that they ,- must scrupulously
observe any contract into which they In good
faith j enter, no matter \u25a0 whether It Is hard to
keei> or not. â¢ '-* '
, If. you save money, secure homes and lead
clean, decent;, modest lives." you will win the
respect of your neighbors . of : both races. Let
each man strive to excel his fellows only by
rendering substantial " service to . the com
munity in which; he lives. The people have
many difficulties -to. pass through, but these
difficulties will be surmounted If only the
policy of reason â¢ and common sensÂ© \u25a0is pur

You have made real end great : progress.
According to the cenf 'is ; the colored '" people

To cry for the moon â and get -it.
One may if one be'a Tetrazzlni, it
seems. They would have given her the
sun. if they had had one last night,
after the "Shadow Dance.' For In "Di
norab," and .In particular In the
"Shadow Dance," Tetrazzlni stackedup
another huge triumph for herself. No
more charming in any role Is the lit
tle singer than In this, and tip-toeing
through the dance, lilting through Its
moonlit, bejeweled measures, sheMs at
her prettiest. The thunder that fol
lowed It put Mr. Meyerbeer's to shame.
Then began a bombardment of flowers.
Tetrazzini caught one" far-flung posy
with the ease of a backstop â with
apologies to the sporting editor. More
followed, violets all. Then several
pounds of roses. It was no use at all
turning on the waterfall of the next
scene, nor Mr. Gregoretti's and Mr.
Bazelli's interesting duet. Signorlna
Tetrazzini had to return, and with the
superb "volonte" that is hers gave the
end of the exacting aria with almost
the pearly freshness with which she
began. B"ut It Is too much to demand â
and impossible not to demand!
Successful altogether was the per
formance. The opera developed most
interestingly. Curious in- its clarity
from the author of "Les Huguenots,"
merry, tuneful, dramatic, most charac
teristic and quick in its appeal, it was
enjoyed from the heroic overture to the
close. The veterans aired traditions of
a "Dinorah" given here thirty years
ago, -but that seems to be the limit of
local acquaintance wltli anything of
the opera but the "Shadow Song."
There was every indication last night
that the audience desired the acquaint
ance, to ripen into friendship, the opera
bidding fair to become one of the
favorites. >
Then the- cast was uncommonly, happy
in Its chief people, In Tetrazzlni, . as be
fore said; in Gregorettl, and in Bazelliâ
yes, Bazelli, who covered himself with
glory as Corentino. Mr. Bazelli has cov
ered himself, with a good many . other
things this season, but his village fool
Is "capital comedy throughout. It needed
no libretto to translate either the terror
of Bazelli's Simple Simon in the first act.
or the simple "guying" of Gregoretti's
Hoel. Tetrazzlni looked IS, quite, as the
village . Ophelia, and contrived well to
get the elfish, fantastical feeling into the
thing. She might, however, have been a
little madder in the first act with ad
vantage. Here -she does some charming
singing. The little yawning song was
beautifully done, and In the next act the
"Gloomy Fate" was gives with a sim
plicity and sympathy that one hardly
looks for from Tetrazzini. It was alto
gether a triumph.
Gregorettl and Bazelll shared honors.

Remember also that the white man who can

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 21.â Through thÂ«

United Patriots of America, a local ln^

various points in this end of the State,
has been defrauded out of a considerable
sum and the authorities are now search

The organization is composed mostly ot
members of the National Guard, but it
is open to general membership. Two
weeks ago two young men giving thÂ©
names of E. R. Sherrin and J. H. Snarkey
applied to the officers of the company
for work as solicitors. They presented
excellent recommendations which. It has
since been discovered were forged. They
were put to work to solicit new members,
it being agreed that they were to bÂ»
paid so much for each new member. As
a result of their work the membership la
the order appeared to enjoy a boom.
They handed In scores of applications
daily and were paid for them at contract
rates.
In due time notices were mailed to thÂ»
new applicants for membership telling
them to call at a certain time and be ex
amined. It was then that the fraud was
discovered. The notices were responded
to by relatives of the persons named la
the applications and the Information giv
en that the "applicant" had died months
ago. Investigation disclosed that thÂ»
swindlers had gone to Rosedale cemetery
and there copied name after name from
the tombstones. They had also- turned

having first ' consulted them.
Before they could be apprehended they
disappeared and their present where

/Â« the center of the wage-earning stronghold^ at Eintracht Hall^ south of Market street,' John S. Partridge, Fusion nominee for ' May or^ last night addressed 3500 men. The
v ovation accorded the candidate who stands o?i the platform of common honesty was highly gratifying and deeply significant. It signifies a change for the better in public
sentiment and inspires with renewed courage the people of San Francis co^ who have resolved to oust the grafters from places of power.
FUSION NOMINEES SPEAK TO VAST AUDIENCE IN EINTRACHT HALL
Nearly Four Thousand Citizens
Pack Eintracht Hall to
Hear Candidate.
Greeting Extended to the Fusion
Standard- Bearer Shakes the
Large Building,
The mass meeting: addressed by John
6. Partridge last night at Eintracht Hall
In the heart of the Labor Union section
ef the city, was the largest yet faced
by the candidate heading the Fusion
ticket. The estimates of the police and
the manager of the hall vary from 3500
to 4000 people, packed In the building to
a point of suffocation.
Prior to the speech at Eintracht Hall
Mr. Partridge visited a crowded house at
Waennerbund Hall, where he was -warm
ly creeled. The outlook for the man who
really has at heart the best interests of
the worklneman. is most encouraging in
the very districts that are populated by
the workingmen.
If the meetings held last night were
any criterion on results Ruef and Schmitz
will be compelled to seek other districts
for the great majorities that Ruef pre
dicts labor will roll up for him south of
Market street. To Quote the candidate's
own words: "It begins to appear that
the workingman is awakening as to who
Are his true friends."
When a man can so into the heart of
s, district supposedly populated by his
opponents as Partridge did last night
and receive the ovaticn that was accord
ed him it begins to appear that the tide
Is turning away from the grafters and
red light workers to the cause of decency
end the home life.
From the time the crowds in the street
were beard cheering Mr. Partridge as he
approached Eintracht Hail last night
until the Fusion leader ascended the
platform the cheering was loud and pro
longed. Through the crowds massed at
the door down the aisle lined with cheer
ing men and extended hands, Mr. Par- j
tridce was hustled to the stage and when
he stood upon the platform facing the
cheering multitude the volume of sound
Jarred the walls and the stamping of
feet shook the floor.
DISORDER. SUPPRESSED.
Mr. Partridge, with his eyes flashing
and his lips smiling, stood patiently
awaiting an opportunity to speak while
the cheering broke forth afresh again
and again. When he did start to speak
a. voice in the gallery yelled for Schmitz.
Instantly tram hundreds of throat* on
floor and in galleries yelled "put him
cut." The cry was taken up and be
came a chant until a policeman In the
gallery started to eject the man. At
that Instant Partridge's clear, ringing
tones rose above the noise and he asked
that the man be allowed to remain. The
Incident served to illustrate the temper
of the gathering and- there were no more
Interruptions.
Mr. Partridge was introduced as "our
next Mayor, a man whom we have all
learned to love." He spoke in part as
follows :
I stand for the Â«<ruare deal and I stand for
the manhood of San Francisco, whether in tha
breast of the merchant or in the breast of
the. poort-Et workman in tne city. When I am
interrupted In the course of my speaking- It
only hurts me }3 that \ want the people co
bear the message I bring them, whether they
vote for me or not, but it is not by yelling at
xne that rr.y opponents can hope to win this
fight.
They might as well stop sending me obscene
letters, they might as well stop hurling vile
epithets, thex might as we:i etop sending hired
thugs to break up meeting* and shadow me,
for there is no power on earth that will pre
vent me from fighting to the end man to man,
and 'winning the fight.
Ia that hall' on the edpe of the Forty- fourth
District words were burled at me by thugs
and ruffians that if flunc at me In the street
would cause one of us to go down and out.
Words that caused the women in the hall to
rise and leave, unable to s:t through the vile
â¢ term that was hurled from the galleries.
WILL FIGHT SQUARELY.
TO will not resort to such methods, because
I'm going to fight fair ana square, and when it
ts finished my opponents will know they've
tieen In a fight and it w::i take ten to count
tne out. I have just come from a hall at
Twenty-fourth and Potrero. They warned me
not to go there, as I might be assaulted.
That did not deter me rrom bearing to the
labor xnÂ«n my message, and what did I find?
Uaennerbund Hall paclcea to overflowing with
the woridngroen of the district, who cheered
the rrlnclplee I ettr.fl for to the echo. I am
told by the other ride that the worklngmen
ere soli 4 for Schmitz. 1\ cay it is a lie and

At the conclusion of Partridge's speech
Henry U. Brandensteln took upon Himself
tha task of attacking the present ad
ministration and tearing: to pieces the
records of the men on the other ticket
regarding their relation with labor. He
told of the work of the Board of Super
visors and the Insight they had gained
Into the grafting that is going on at the
City Hall. He told of Schmitz's words as
he dismissed one of the foremost labor
leaders of the city, Michael Casey, from
the Board of Public Works. Schmits
said, speaking of Casey, "God made him
for a man; let him pass as such." And
then the Mayor appointed to succeed him
a man who is not a representative of the
labor Interests of the community.
The first speaker and one of the best
of the evening was Thomas W. Hlckey,
who was presented by the chairman of
the evening, James Filgate. Hickey was
enthusiastically received and gave his
hearers what one enthusiast character
ised as "the true dope" on the present
administration. He told of the necessity
in the old days for a young man enter
ing politics to be branded with the boss'
brand of political Infamy before he was
accepted as a party worker. He urged the
voters to fight against such a condition
by defeating Buef and Schmitz.
Robert Ferral of the District Attorney's
office was aleo a leading speaker. He
warned the people against placing an
Incompetent man In the District At
torney's office, for cuch an act, he said,
would be provocative of riot and the
vigilance committee. He said that Dang
don was a better man than Brandensteln
for school teacher, but that the office of
District Attorney was too much to pay
to a "good fellow." He added that the
District Attorney's office was not a place
to learn the law; one should know the
law before he goes there.
The other speaker of the evening was
M. J. Kuhl, who attacked the records

THIRTV-SECOXD TURNS OUT.
Partridge Received by Enthusiastic
Crowd That Fills Maen
aerbuod Hall.
In the heart of the Thirty-second
district, at Maennerbund Hall. Mr.
Partridge was greeted. by an audience
that filled every available space and
lined the hallways back to the stairs.
At the beginning: of the meeting there
were a few cheers for Schmitz, but the
faint effort put forth by Ruef's admir
ers raised a laugh and the Interruptions
were not attempted again during the
evening-.
The presiding officer of the evening,
M. J. Wren, introduced Daniel A. Ryan
as the first speaker. Ryan was at his
best last night and put forth the issues
of the fight In forceful words.- Ho
spoke in part as follows:
This la. one of the greatest political conUsta
ever waged in Saa Francisco. Never has there
been on* so Interesting, co absorbing or so bit
ter. It Is not an ordinary political fight In
tha general acceptance of the word. It Is a
contest for what may be characterized in tha
simple words decency In city government. It
Is the campaign of the fathers and mothers.
It Is a campaign to rescue aan Francisco from
the man that hold* ber entirely in his hand,
Abraham Ruef. j i
Ko one can deny that he controls the city
government. Look at thÂ« Board of Works, the I
Police Commission, the Firs Commission. Look
at thÂ« Health Board and the Election Board.
Do they not do the bidding of tha boss without
a murmur? If you wanted to build a home
in San Francisco to-day you would have to
pay for the privilege. Ruef owns and controls
Schmitz as he owns and controls the commis
sions and the city government. 1
Here you have the representatives" of the
voters controlled by a man who was 'never
heard of in connection with labor until labor
could serve his turn. It is a false issue in this
fight to cry class against class and that the
capitalists are trying to down the labor unions.
If Â«uch were the case would not the labor
leaders of the city, Btate and nation be hero
fighting for their organization? This is not
labor's fight; It Is a fight against Abe Ruef
and graft.
If this was a fight against labor you would
not find me on this platform; you would find
me, heart and soul, working for the. cause I
was brought up In and among- whose people
I number my relatives and friends. If . this
were such a fight would you find John S. Par
tridge, a workingman since his youth, heading
a ticket composed of men who have modest
means at best?
Where Is the labor ticket? Are you repre
sented on It? Were you consulted In its form
ation, and did you sanction and indorse' tbe
Jobchasers that monopolize the ticket to the
exclusion of labor representatives? Who Is I
this man who sets himself ac the protector of
the rights of labor? You have heard of the
Fairmount district. In the vicinity of Thirtieth
and Castro streets, where Gray Brothers' quar
ry is blasting near the homes of the . poor.
Schmite ' may fool some of the worklngmen
some of the time, but the men in that district
know that the present issue of this campaign
is between the poor people and Gray Brothers.
The Board 'of Supervisors passed an ordinance
prohibiting the blasting, maintaining that It
was destroying' the homes of the poor. Eu
gene, the champion of labor, vetoes the ordi
nance, and the blasting is resumed. Did he or
Abe Ruef care? Why was the ordinance ve
toed? I leave that to your common sense.
Do you know that there are â¢ 107 non-union
men In the employ of Gray Brothers, and yet
union men that are led by P. H. McCarthy
bundle the bricks made by tbe firm? Is It out
of the kindness of their hearts that these fa
vors are granted to Gray Brothers?

conclusion* of Mr, Ryan's ; speech and

Forces in the Districts
South of Market Street
GBAFTERS PERCEIVE
A TURN OF AFFAIRS
Mass Meeting at Alhambra
Theater To-Night Will. "Be
Addressed by Well-Known
Citizens of the Metropolis
The weakening on the line of the
grafters is perceptible. It is true that
the Schmitz rallies are well attended
and that the janitors, pavers, sweepers,
inspectors and others on the municipal
pay roll shout in chorus for the Mayor,
but the demonstrations have not the
strength and character noted In the
Union Labor meetings two years ago.
Many of the leaders in the cause of
organized labor are silent. Â«Too much
Ruef has made them weary and sick.
The frank, fearless and manly at
titude of John S. Partridge, the can
didate of the Republicans and Demo
crats, 1b respected and applauded.
There is widespread belief that Part
ridge will drive out the boodlers and
grafters and conduct the affairs of
local government on lines of common
honesty and with justice to all classes.
Workingmen note the fact that the
founders of the Union Labor party get
the promise of patronage in the heat
of election campaigns, but that Ruef's
henchmen get the goods when the bat
tle is over.
One of the significant events of the
campaign was the tremendous meeting
last night at Eintracht Hall, in the cen
ter of the Union Labor camp south of
Market street. It is estimated that
nearly 400&. men listened to John* 8.
Partridge, giving earnest attention to
his appeal" for common honesty in the
management of city affairs. The truth
is again demonstrated that the people
of San Francisco, irrespective of
wealth, station or political affiliation,
intend to give Partridge a fair deal.
Ruffians and rowdies, incited by des
i perate grafters, may insult the fusion
speakers, but the common people re
sent such tactics.
The election signs at present fore
shadow as large a vote for Partridge
south of Market street as the vote of
Crocker and Lane combined. There Is
not the slightest doubt of Partridge
gains in the south of Market street sec
tion. In the Republican League dis
tricts north of the great avenue the
Partridge majorities will be immense.
The Fusion Campaign Committee made
no mistake In carrying the war against
graft and boodle into the districts
which Schmitz carried two years ago
and which he believed at the beginning
of the present contest that he would
against win with increased majorities.
The Mayor now 6ees the. folly of the
Ruef ters in tearing down Partridge
banners and hurling unspeakable
epithets at the fusion nominees. The
reaction has taken place and the Mayor
is hedging. \u25a0
The demonstration at .. the * Alhambra
Theater to-night in support of the prin
ciples of a clean administration of muni
cipal affairs may be very important.
Fairfax H. Wheelan, one of the foremost
leaders and organizers of the campaign
to expel the boodlers and grafters from
the City Hall, will speak his sentiments
freely and fearlessly.
waÂ» next presented. He \u25a0poke In part
as follows:
This is the first district in whlob I - did
politics and this is the very hall In which I
made my first speech. Right here I am re
ceiving the great receptions that have been
my lot since I started the campaign, with tnÂ»
exception of the meeting at Garibaldi Hall.
There I was Insulted and the language was so
foul that women left the hall in ahame and
confusion. But I reseat it with indignation
when it is said that labor men created thÂ»
disturbance. Its a He. The men who raised
the rlof at Garibaldi Hall were hired thus*
and ruffian*. To-day t among the mechanic!
in a laboring center I told my story and wai
listened to respectfully. Do you think those
are the men who are around Inciting riot and
trying to break up meetings?
The condition of the Board of Health to
day Is scandalous. The revelations concerning
Kb methods are astounding. ' Dr. . Dillon has
told you of the diseased meat and irnpurt
milk passed by the Board, of Health 'for sal<
In the homes of the poor. They were sold to
bring in the revenue of graft, and are the
men who permit such a thing your friends!
I am under the domination of.no political
or mercantile agency. When Mayor Schmlti
learned I was the choice of the caucus'- hr
launched his first He â¢ about me. He said 1
was an A. P. A. When he found that couldn't
be made to stick he charged me ,with beinÂ»
a puppet like himself . When the : people re
fused to believe that hft .: followed, up his to
cusatlons with the charge that I lived "In
Berkeley. There is one thing,! want you" to
be sure of. No honest, decent, self-respecting
man Is going to get' the worst of It from
John Partridge. ; \ .\u25a0:
SECOND CROWD IS DISAPPOINTED
Owing? to Unfortunate Error at Fusion
: Headquarters Worklnsrmen Fall "*\ \u25a0-
to Hear Partridge.
Through error at headquarters of the
fuslonists a large crowd of working
men were disappointed, in the failure of
John S. Partridge to speak at Folsom
and Seventh f street â¢ yesterday . noon.
When it was learned at .fusion head
quarters that . 300 -hid gathered 'at the
street corner an attempt was made to"
locate ' Mr. Partridge and ask. hlm-sto
visit the other place, , but without avail.'
Although '\u0084 no -announcement i was
made of- a. meeting Â«af. Nineteenth a and
Harrison streets, v a| fair sized : crowd^
was ; present to" llstun to / the words \ol.
the fusion leader and gave ; him aVcor-^

WRITS OF MANDATE
ISSUED TO COMMISSION
Attorney for Higher Liquor License Peti
tioners Goes to Supreme Court.
The Election Commissioners were
served with writs of mandate yesterday
by the Supreme' Court compelling them to
place upon the ballot at the coming elec
tion the question of higher liquor license.
The proceedings of mandamus were is
sued on the petition of Attorney J.
White, who represents the petitioners for
a higher liquor license. The issuance of
the mandamus would appear to have been
an unnecessary proceeding on the part of
White, inasmuch as the Election 1 Com
mission had done at its meeting last
Thursday afternoon the. very thing which
they, are ordered to do In the mandamus.
In his petition for mandamus White al
leges that the Election Board has J taken
no action in the matter ? of placing the
question of higher liquor license on the
ballot so that the public might be given
a chance to sustain the petitioners or
otherwise. Last - Thursday afternoon a
special . meeting was called by the board
and the attorneys representing the two
sides of the liquor question were invited
to appear. White did ; not show up,, and
after the argument of counsel for the
liquor dealers was heard, by/ unanimous
vote of the Commissioners a motion was
passed to the effect that the question go
on the official ballot reading, "Imposing
a license ;on' retail; liquor dealers; of $125
a quarter, for or against." j
Â§Â£At the regular meeting of the board last
night Attorney White was accused by the
board of having falsely represented the
facts of the ; case: to the j Supreme Court:
The Commissioners iweref irate after hay
ing done 5 last Thursday iln open " meeting

er 'liquor; license, - expressed i himself ; as
wroth at the \u25a0 action' of .White' In securing
the mandamus, i White sustained his action
by stating | that he ".was $ fearful [ lest jj the

SCHMITZ RIDICULOUS
IN HIS CHAR GES.
Mayor Declares Fusionists Hired Thugs
to Disturb Garibaldi Meeting.
Mayor Schmitz seemed to be in a
highly humorous frame of mind last
night It may be that he did not mean
to be funny in his remarks, but when
he directly accused Partridge of pack
ing Garibaldi Hall a week ago with
rowdies and crooks to disturb his own
meeting be departed from tbe humor
ous and entered the realms of absurd
ity/ . . . â¢ . â. \u25a0'
He made this accusation with a
great show of candor, stating that . it
was a secret .which had but just come
to his ears, and yet at the very time
at which he said It he knew that tbe
meeting waa held In the very heart of
the Ruef section, and he remembered
the command of his master . made at
the Alhambra Theater, when be ordered
bis paid ruffians to Insult the fusion
leaders whenever possible and to make
trouble at the meetings of the rival
candidates. Schmitz accused the fus
ionists 'of quietly planning this dis
graceful, demonstration as a play for
the decent votes of r this city.. Yet
when he said the words he knew that
many of the demonstrators wore his
own button and were well-known
members :of the ; Ruef camp. Still the
Mayor ' said all this and assured his
hearers - that \u25a0 he was making . a quiet,
lady-like campaign,, with no mud
slinging and no casting of untruths at
his* opponents. , as if hoping that this
appearance of decency would ' cast a
mist over the eyes of the intelligent
voter and prevent him from seeing the
falsehood that peeped out from be
neath.
Mayor Schmitz also made another
startling declaration. 'He admitted
that r many of ;_ the ''* labor leaders and
wage earners were switching, to^the
fusion 1 ranks, but In the , same breath
he cried that ; they had been purchased
â¢ with boodle funds. The Mayor admit
ted that;- he was losing votes among
those . from -whom he had the
strongest support, and then, to hide the
real significance of these desertions, he
raised the shout of fraud, hoping that
! the' eyes of -the 'voter would be again
with": illegal , registration and if they
persist' to : cause lthelr.< arrest: In view
of this fact: it will be Interesting to see
how I many . of these 1 men do persist in
their; effort \ to j get in ' the ' penitentiary
by, fraudulently swearing In their votes
In an 'effort, to bolster up a corrupt and
losing cause
j blinded. But such was not tbe case.
: Scant cheers greeted this accusation
.against the workingmen of this city.
On the other band, the Mayor said
that he was gaining votes among tbe
men .in the wholesale district. He
spent the entire afternoon of yesterday
in visiting this district and be met
there many of tbe business men of tha
city. With him were several of tbe
candidates of tbe Union Labor party.
Three large meetings greeted Mayor
Schmitz last night. The first was an
open air gathering, held at the Inter
section of Folsom street and Preolta
avenue. Stephen | Burns presided.
A large crowd waa gathered in Har
mony Hall. Mission and Erie streets.
Riggers' and Stevedores' Hall. 121
New Montgomery street, was well
filled. 'The Mayor was greeted with
cheers as be entered the building. â¢ It'
was s here â¢ that be made .his charges
against the fuslonists and said that tha
-workingmen were selling, out to the
other side.

t made to wait for a tug that was signal
ing the steamer. . The thickening of the
fog'wffs described and the incident, dwelt
upon that through the rift of the fog
high land was visible for an Instant,
which led the pilot to surmise that he
was near the north shore, although ho
did not hear the Lime Point whistle.
Pilot Johnson testified that he got the
Impression from something which .. Cap
tain Dowdell said that the captain feared
the ship was too near LJme Point. Ha
said he could not recollect the. words
used by the captain.
Later on Captain Thomas Dowdell tes
tified that he gave the ship Into Pilot
Johnson's charge immediately on leaving
Pacific street wharf. - The time was given
as 11:11 a. m. Captain Dowdell testified
on direct- and fros*Â»~examinatTbn -that
he did not say to Pilot Johnson that the
ship was too close to the north shore,
and did not use any language Implying
that he had such an opinion. Captain
Dowdell did testify, however, that shortly
after the fog thickened, while the vessel
was going at full speed, he suggested
half speed and the sounding of the
whistle.
Pilot Johnson testified that Captain
Dowdell gave the order for half speed
and, the sounding of the whistle, but that
he (Johnson) did not interpose an objec
tion. The captain testified that the pilot
was sober.
Other witnesses as follows testified:
Peter C. N>l6on, lighthouse keeper Lime
Point; George D. Cobb, lighthouse keep
er. Port Point: T. Olsen, seaman lookout;
Jack Ellis, quartermaster; L. "S. Jordan,
third officer; P. J. Owens, chief engineer,
steamship Alameda; Pilots. John yon
Helms. John E. McCulloch and George
D. Korts.
An affidavit from Howard K. James,'
of Alameda.- to the effect that he heard
the Lime Point fog horn on September
30. 1905. at 11:30 a. m., was submitted.
Peter C. Nelson's testimony, was to the
efft<:t that the DTme Point whistle was
blowing before the distress' signals of the I
Alameda were heard. He offered to sub
mit affidavits to corroborate his testi
mony, but Attorney Lukens objected on
the ground that the aftlants were not
present for cross-examination. The af
fidavits were not admitted. \u25a0
The investigation will be resumed to
day.
Bearings Were Accurate.

the steamer St_ Paul when she was
wrecked off the northern coast of Cal
ifornia recently, Plates that In the pub
lished reports of his testimony before

draw, the,.-, complaint, and the same*
method of revenge would be followed
In' regard to every member of the Louie
family in Chinatown."
Louie Chew appealed to the Six Com
panies for protection. The .Six Com
panies held a meeting on Monday night
to" discuss the matter." No action was.
taken, owing, it is alleged, to the faci
that Lee Ling, the secretary of the Six
Companies, Is a member of "the Suey
Sing tong. Louie Chew thereupon ap
pealed to the Chinese Consul General.
Chief Dlnan was also notified. lie
sent for Sergeant Ross of. the Ctiina
town squad and. instructed him to af- j
ford every protection to. the; members ,
cf the Louie family and to search high- i
binders for weapons. Merchants who
bear the name of Louie* are so afraid
that the highbinders will carcy out
their threats that they have employed
Morse's patrolmen to guard their prop
erty and -persons: -â¢. â¢ ; ;
Louie Poy was murdered because it
was said he gave away secrets "of the
Suey Sings to rival tongs. The police,
however, say that Ng Poy and Louie
Poy had trouble over a Chinese woman I
slave and that. this was the cause of;
the murder. Ng Poy was arrested by
Detective George McMahon on Satur
day and Louie Chew swore to the'com- j
plaint on Monday morning;. .

OVERCOMING OBSTACLES
Dearth in Supply of Labor

- WASHINGTON, Oct. , 24.-The isthmi
an canal commission to-day made pub
lic a letter" written rby Isham Randolph, a
member of the board of consulting-; en
gineers of the. Panama canal, ;to . Zina
R. Cajter, president of the sanitary dis

ters. He has ..recently returned from a
visit to Panama, with other members of
the aboard and his opinions are interest
ing, and, in ; view, of the publication of
this, letter, tay the commission, may be
considered semi-official. In his letter Mr.
Randolph says:
What' we do know is that it can be done;*
that American? . can do It In as: short a timo
as so stupendous an' undertaking can bÂ«'put

When the equipment is on hand and the or
ganization perfected, at_least 24,000 men will
be required in the -various departments of in
dustry. The source of supply for. labor so far
has been Jamaica. The efficiency of this la
bor is as low as "5 per cent, taking an average
laborer in our latitude as the unit. This is
due in part to the. fact : that ths supply is not
equal to the demand, and an Independence Is
thereby Induced : which tends to worthlessness.
If a "foreman undertakes tn'make- them 66 a

which is "said to reach $30,0C0.000. This ma

NBW TORK. Oct. 24.â Apparently
suffering from rabies, Amanda Jones,
aged 27, who was bitten by a dog:
thirteen years ago. was taken from her
home to a hospital yesterday, and to
day she was sent to Bellevue. for fur

According: to the family, the patient
V hen 14 years old was bitten on both
hsnds by a dog. but the wounds were
cauterized and no ill effects appeared
until last June, when Miss Jones sud

violent that the combined strength of
four men would hardly suffice to keep
' her in restraint. She recovered from
this attack and was In good health un

curred. Removed to a hospital, she ap
parently recovered, but Sunday night
the same symptoms reappeared. Foam

VEMEZUELA DISPUTE
United States to Intervene for France
AMERICAN MINISTER TO VENEZUELA WHO HAS BEEN DIRECTED TO TRY
TO PATCH UP THE DIFFERENCES WHICH HAVE CAUSED 'A RUPTURE
BETWEEN FRANCE AND THE GOVERNMENT OF CASTRO, i
CARACAS, Venezuela, Oct. 24.â The
Government at- Washington' has com
missioned the American Minister. Mr.
Russell, to. endeavor to arrange the
Franco-Venezuelan diplomatic Incident.
Mr. Russell will go to Losteques and
have an interview with President' Cas
tro.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 24. â Pending the
result of Mr. Russell's Interview with
President Castro the State Department
will not discuss its nature. It should
be understood, however, that he will
confine his efforts to a ppssible. assist
ance in: the solution of the Taigny In
cident involving President Castro's al
leged discourteous 'treatment- of . the
French Minister â¢at Caracas.' The
Washington Government feels that
President Castro made a mistake in
this matter..
As soon as it became known . that
this was the paramount grievance Â»of
France against Venezuela, and the' pri
mary cause for the dispatch: of the
French squadron, the hope was held
here that France might find a way for
the settlement of her trouble with
Venezuela without resort to force. Re
cent conferences have been held at the
State Department between Secretary
Root and Mr. Jusserarid, the French
Embassador, and between Root and the
Venezuelan Charge. \u25a0 The \u25a0\u25a0 Charge Is
lending bis efforts to a diplomatic ad
justment.
At the -French embassy, when j in
formed of the effort of the American
Minister. at Caracas to arrange an
agreement between France and- Vene
zuela, - the following authoritative
statement was made:
"We are extremely happy to hear of
the very kind intervention , of the
United States and we are "sure, that
under the circumstances France. would
have been glad to render the same
service to the United States. And the
news of the intervention seems ; to us
all the better because it will, without
any doubt, enable President Castro to
realize the error made by his Minis
ter of Foreign Affairs and probably will
have the result that France will not
have to take recourse to such methods
as she would dislike very much to
use, but for which In case of- need -.all
preparations have been made."
Senor Veloz, the Venezuelan Charge
d'Affaires to this country, had not yet
been officially informed about the atti
tude of France and therefore declined
to make any statement. He called on
Secretary Root to-day, but claimed that
the only purpose of his visit was to in
form the Secretary of the appointment
of a Venezuelan consul at Philadelphia.
- The firm reticence maintained at the
State Department regarding Mr. -Rus
sell's mission is evidence of the Im-.
portance which is attached to it.;-^^f%
\u25a0 . \u25a0 . , \u0084 ;
The diplomatic incident which Min
ister Russell will endeavor to settle
arose from the protest lodged on Sep
tember 19 at Caracas by the French
Charge d'Affaires, M. Taigny, against
\u25a0the closing of the Caracas station of
the French Cable Company und the ex
pulsion from Venezuela of the manager
of the company, M. Brun. The Vene
zuelan Government sent the following
reply to AL Taigny:
"The Government holds documents
proving that the French Cable Com
pany, has- accepted the result of the
Judicial proceedings brought against It,
The Government Is only to es
tablish new relations between it and
the * company. M. Taigny, the French
Charge . d'Affaires, knows this and
therefore' the protest can be onlyNjon
sidered as an act of personal hostility.
For this ' reason- "the Government -will
abstain from' treating with the French
Government through M. Taigny."
This note gave offense to the' French
Government, and .;' France requested
Venezuela to withdraw- that part of the
note which gave notice that Venezuela
would not communicate further
through M. Taigny.

* tory of President McCurdy
NEW YORK, Oct. 24.â At to-day's ses
sion of the legislative commission, inyes- j
tigating the insurance companies the af
fairs of the Mutual were \u25a0 under consid
eratioh-and it was brought out that this
company was paying for the dissemina
tion throughout the country of - reports
of this investigation tnat were favorable
to the company...
Charles J. Smith, a newspaper man,
was the witness. He is employed by the
Mutual to do a large number of .things,
but a month ago was placed in charge of
sending out these reports. Smith had
vised a number of .vouchers for the
payment of this work and these aggre
gated $11,000, with more bills to come in.
Smith wrote these reports' and submit
ted them to Allen Foreman, who owns
the Telegraphic News Bureau, :and $1 a
line was paid by the Mutual Life ' for
the service. .
These dispatches were sent to about
100. papers, but Smith did not 1 know
whether the papers were paid for insert-
Ing them. In. one dispatch Smith wrote
that McCurdy's. attitude on the stand
made a distinctly favorable impression,
and for; this he had to pay. $2 a t line.
This, he "said, was worth it... - - . . '
Following Smith, Walter Sullivan, who
has charge of the magazine advertising
department,! was called.- He said the Mu
tual advertised in twelve magazines last
year at a .cost, of about J42.000.;; Advertis
ing in insurance papers cost about- $30,000
more, but he could not *tell where the re
mainder of the account of $328,000, the
amount .charged to advertising last; year,
was spent.. :-\: -\ \ >
McCLINTOCK FAVORS PUBLICITY.
Earlier in the day Emory McClintock,
the actuary of the Mutual Life, was on
the stand. McClintock practically ad
vocated no laws for the insurance com
panies except a certain supervision to
give the repot ts . publicity. He thought
the public could take care of itself and
that publicity was tae best law.,' Asked
how. far this view was shared 'in offi
cial circles, he said he was somewhat of
a missionary along that line. McClintock
was to have been brPthe stand again at
the aiternoon session, but during .' the ,
recess.he. he was 'seized by a slight attack"
of .vertigo, to ', which*,' he '^ Is, subject.* He

John R. Hegemanr.piesldcht of thejMje|U'
ropolitan Life Insurance" Compahy.^.was
examined. | When the ' adjournment ..'was
taken; this afternoon "': his \u25a0 testimony, was
unfinished.'"; ;''';* .*,â¢... ' . ,' ; , .<
.While lacking the startling features of
the testimony of- spme : .pf , the \other_ life
insurance 'presidents, Hegeman's. remarks
and explanations ;.were none . the less in
teresting, 'especially his statements that
$876,000 was given to the industrial policy
nolders of , his company last year without
any- obligation whatever. , j '
LOANS \OT SHOWN IN REPORT.
It was .brought- out that .while .the com
pany carried j collateral loans throughout
the year, none appeared in the annual
report, on. December .'31.. .This was ex
plained, by the witness, who said that; all
collateral loans were transferred on the
last day of the year to Vermilye & Co.,
the bankers, under an agreement, and
.were bought, back in January., This was
done to avoid -the horde of applications
for call loans from the Wall street dis
trict. -..oHegt'man.r did not encourage the
call loan ; business : because it entailed
keeping a ticker ,in; his office^ and he
would not have one there. He further
did, not care to have his company known
as a loaning company.- !r â¢ .}\u25a0 -V /
The ; large loans at such a low interest
as l l^ per- cent, especially the ;one"4to
President -McCall of j the : New -York Life,
was taken up and. Hegeman spoke strong
ly of his friendship: for McCall, who, he
said, was closer, than any 'other "man to
him in the insurance business, outside of
his immediate , associates. McCall had
\u25a0rendered him valuable service that was
of benent.t^>theÂ« company, and' person
ally^ ho thought the -company could af
ford to pay,, and, would .have been justi
fied in paying McCall a few hundreds of
dollars which the loans amounted to. , The
same was true, . he said,- of ...Silas B.
Dutcher, a director of'the company, who
also: carried large: loans with the com
pany, at low interest." : â¢ â¢â¢

FATE OF CASE
IS WITH JUDGE
Plea of the Natural Child
of the Late Chas. R. Lloyd
Is Argued and Submitted
LAWYERS TALK ALL DAY
Thresh Out Legal Aspects
of the Contention, Which
Court Waits to Consider
OAKLAND. Oct. 24. â The arguments
in the Â«ise of Elizabeth Lloyd Nix
against the estate of the late Charles
R. Lloyd were finished this evening
and the matter of whether the natural
child of Lloyd is to be allowed to share
with the other children in the deceased
capitalist's estate is now up to the
court for decision and he has taken it
under advisement. All day long the
iittorntys analyzed the legal aspect of
the case pro and con and the young
woman, the plaintiff, is waiting anx
iously for the decision.
The position taken by Attorneys
Frank I'owers and M. C. Chapman for
her is that she and her mother were
lured from England to this country by
Lloyd after he Kad deserted them for
fourteen years. He promised that he
would make them more comfortable
here than they were. Promise after
promise was broken by him until
linaliy to cancel all previous promises
he said he would leave her a child's
thare in his estate appraised at $360,
000. This promise was made on condi
tion that they should act toward him
as a wife and daughter and at the same
time conceal the relationship, and they
claim their right now to come -into a
court of equity and have that promise
made good.
-Utorney W. S. Goodfcllow, for the
trustees of the Lloyd estate, contends
that Lloyd's promises did not amount
to a contract. His defense was entirely
technical. He rolled much on the in
definiteness pi the promises.

Driver Charged With Cruelty
to Animals Tells a
Strange Story.
OAKLAND, Oct. 24.â When arcsted and
brought into court this morning on a
charge of driving a horse that was so
lame that it could hardly walk, P. C
Tufte, employed as a driver by J.
Llewellyn, a painter, explained to Police
Judge Quinn that his employer was a
believer in Christian Science, and was.
trying to cure the animal of its lame
nc-ss by following the teachings of that
healing doctrine. Tufte said that the
horse had run a i long splinter into its
loot, and that he had at once put a
poultice on the injured, member, but that
his employer told him: that > the horse
could be made well by Science treatment,
end had ordered him to take off the poul
tice and work the animal as usual.
The <3river did as he was told, and as
a result he was arrested for cruelty to
animals by Deputy Sheriff I. H. Herold.
Whether or not the treatment of animals
by Christian Science will be countenanced
by the law will be decided after an ex
amination of the owner of the horse, the
case having been continued this morning
that he might be brought into court.
DRAMATICS IX TAXCLB.
BERKELEY, Oct. 24. â A queer tan
gle has been created in the plans at the
university for the production of
-Paola and Francesca" by the declara
tion of Professor yon Neumayer to-day
that November 18, the date set for the
play by the executive committee of the
Associated Students, is* not the date he
has chosen or would choose, that he is
the person to fix a date for the produc
tion, and that he has not yet decided
â¢what date will be suitable. The ap
parent conflict between Professor yon
Ncuraayer and the executive â¢ commit
tÂ»-Â«* of the student body is regarded by
\u25a0well-informed persons at the univer
sity as the result of friction between
two sets of persons interested in di
recting dramatic activities in college.
Professor William Dailam Armos, pres
ident of the University Dramatic Asso
ciation, which is giving the "Paola and
Francesca"' play, is reported to be im
patient at the delay In the produc
tion.

Western Pacific Is Landing Shipments o
Ties at Convenient Points.
Engineer Says Tunnel Will Be Built to
Reach Niles Canyon.
OAKLAND. Oct. 24.â The Western Pa
cific Railroad is distributing immense
quantities of construction material at
every point along its lines that Is accessi
ble by water, in order to be prepared to
begin work in the various sections as
soon as the route is ' finally selected, . and
the matter of rights of way settled.
Cargo after cargo of railroad ties \u0084Â»ave
been* landed at West Oakland, and .large
quantities have also been shipped by
barges to Banta Station on thÂ« San Joa
quin River, alid to Sacramento and Stock
ton. When the construction of the road
into this city Is begun work will be
commenced simultaneously at Oakland,
the San Joaquin River Crossing, Stockton
and Sacramento.
The Western Pacific will use the. coal
road from Stockton to the San Joaquin
River Crossing, but will not come through
the Corral Hollow Pass. Division En
gineer J. T. Williams said to-day that
the route between Oakland and Nlles had
not yet tfeen selected. It has been de
cided, however, that a part of the route
will be through the Niles Canyon, and a
i tunnel will be driven through the Niles
J foothills to enter the canyon.
Division Englmer Williams, in discuss
ing the plans of the company, said to
day: (
"Work on the tunnel will bo com
menced at once, but it will probably take
nearly a year to complete the work. The
necessary men and machinery will be on
the ground within a few days. There
are still a number of details to arrange
concerning the route ' between Oakland
and Niles, but I am satisfied that all our
plans will be formulated and the pre
liminary work of construction well under
way within ninety days."
CHILD SONGS
ENJOYED BY
EBELL CLUB
ZOE GREEN RADCLIFFE
: OAKLAND. Oct. 24.â The few who did not
attend the Ebell meeting to-day missed a rare
musical treat. Preceding a delightful pro
gramme of songs and piano selections by Mrs.
and Mr. Arthur Flekenscher, an interesting
paper on voice culture via read by Mrs. Fick
enscher. Then she sang a group of children's
songs, nearly all by German composers, in a
most charming manner, in the second group,
which consisted of English Â«ongs, there were
two original compositions by Mr. Flckenscher
that were received with nattering applause.
The words of "Boats" were written by Robert
Louis Stevenson and "The Brass Band" was a
fascinating little Jingle by Charles Keeler. So
many were asking for the names of this de
lightful group of songs that I append the list:
"A Carriage," "Stork Stork," "The Fairy."
"The Broom," by RvlnicKe; "The Cuckoo."
Schaefer; "Der Hahn,"-Cui; "Strampelchen,"
Hildach: "Butzemann." Taubert; "Feuerzau
ber/' Wagner; "Kitty Cat," "Had a' Little
Pony." "Margery." "Riding On a Rail." "Dia
monds." "Boats," Stevenson and Fickenscher;
"The Brass Band." Keeler.
One of Mr. Fickenscher's piano numbers
was the magic fire music rrom "Der Walku
rie." by Wagner.
To Mrs. W. R. Davis, the presiding hostess,
are due the thanks- of those who enjoyed a very
pleasant afternoon to-day. The decoration
committee was also happy in its work, masses
of scarlet blossoms giving an effective touch
and vivid color to the paie furnishings of the
auditorium.
Mrs. Davis was assisted in receiving and
later in dispensing the club's hospitality by

The programme that Harold Bauer will give
here next Friday afternoon at Ye Liberty
more closely approximates a "popular" pro
gramme than any he has yet given. The ex
quisite Beethoven Sonata Appassionata. the
Alkan study, "The Wind," that created such
a sensation in San Franncisc, and Wagner's
wonderful "Ride of the Valkyries" are some
of the things that will attract the attention of
every music lover. The entire programme is
as follows:
"Sonata Appassionata" (Beethoven); (a)
"Papilloue" (Schumann), (b) "Ballade in O

have been required to - purchase special
spectacles, g Those whose eyesight Is de
fective must have four, pairs of spec

of these pairs must be duplicated for
such cases of emergency as breakage or
accident. It has been found in the exam
inations that the hearing of the employes

the sea of matrimony.
The first to bo informed of the mar
riage of Mr. Kahn were his two chll T
dren, a boy and a girl, aged respec^
tively 11 and IB years, and later the
news was made known to the em
ployes of the firm. Several years ago
the former' wife iof Mr. \ Kaniv* passed
away, and so serious was the effect of
her death on the health of her husband
that he was obliged for a time to give
up business cares.
Like her husband, the bride has once
before been married, and she has been
a friend for some time of the man who
has. just become her husband. During

Sisters of Late Politician
Want Tlieir Money and the
Wi(iow ; a Double Allowance
BOTH FILE PETITIONS
While One Is Drawing $500 a
Month, the Others Are Now
Clamoring ; for Their Shares
. OAKLAND, Oct. 24.â The complaint
of the four sisters of the late Frank.
J. Mofiitt, made In court a few days
ago ,that, although four months have
passed since the death of their brother,
nothing has been done toward" the in-,
vestment of $40,000 ; for their | beneflt.y
was- met to-day by Mrs. Augusta L.
Moffltt, the. widw, coming Into j court
and asking to 'have her allowance
raised from $500 to $1000 a month.
The legal outcroppings are such as
lead the legal fraternity , to the belief
that all is not serene between the relict
of the .late politician and his sisters
and that a -legal battle is imminent.
Mrs. "Moffltt's present allowance from
the estate is $500 and was fixed at this
sum by the court, although she at that
time asked for $750. The sisters say

KIOTOUS CONDUCT
IS TO BE STOPPED
Seniors at the University Are
Haled Before the
Committee.
BERKELEY. Oct. 24.â Determined that
the student body should know, thoroughly
the attitude of the university authorities
in the matter of riotous conduct, on or
off the campus, the faculty committee on
student affairs this morning summoned
four of. the most prominent seniors in
college for a hearing on the charge of
unseemly conduct in the university -li
brary building. Sentence was not pro
nounced and the students do not know
what will be theftr fate. '
The men called before the faculty com
mittee are Howard Hart Salz, Milton Her
man Salz, Ira Wheeler and Frank Had
ley. Complaint had been made to -the
authorities last week that a crowd of
university men nightly invaded the" uni
versity library building, and there, after
a series of improper actions, gave'what is
known In college as ihe "Snent Oski Wow
Wow."
The "Silent Oski Wow Wow" is regard
ed as a most insidious device for destroy
ing decorum, wherever. It may be ren
dered. -It consists of a mere movement
of the lips, giving the famous "Oski" in
pantomime, until the final climacteric
shriek 13 reached, when the pantomime Is
dropped and | a genuine, well ' authenti
cated.yell is produced., . \u25a0 S*;^ . ;â¢'
I Librarian .Rowel l.. resented this practice
of'a, group "of college of, commerce men
who made. the. library their headquarters
while "cramming", for a rather despised
course In economics which; seniors: have
to -take td graduate. .Inspired by a dis
like for. this course the men relieved their
feelings with the "Silent Oski."
INJURED BY EXPLOSIOX.
ALAMEDA, Oct. 24. â Through the
explosion of a quantity of gasoline on
board of the launch Manila of the At
lantic, Gulf and Pacific Company, at
work-in the estuary last night, Carl
Olson's right arm - and hand .were
frightfully lacerated and seared. Am
putation of the main limb may be
found necessary. Olson was alone in
the engine-room when .the accident
happened and in his, suffering condi
tion was compelled to row a boat to
the shore in order to reach his home at
2312 Blanding avenue, where his
wounds were 'given "medical attention
by Dr. W. J. Hosford.
Olson is unable to account: for the
explosion of the gasoline, which was
stored .in the engine-room of the
launch. The fluid blew up about 7:30
o'clock last night and It was two hours
before Olson was able to reach his resi
dence. The . injured man Is a well
known dredger engineer and Is a mem
ber of the Alameda Aerie of Eagles.
RINKS TABOOED.
BERKELEY, Oct. 24.â Skating rinks
in Berkeley are regarded by the Feder
ation of Churches as a "menace to the
youth" 'of. the town and a proper sub
ject for inhibitory legislation; by the
Town Trustees. A petition asking that
an ordinance be passed prohibiting a
proposed roller skating rink on Alls
ton way, a few yards west of the. town
hall; was* presented to the trustees last
night and by the trustees referred to
the. police -committee.
Deputy Marshal ' Levi Moran's' resig

Special Dispatch to The CalL
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 24.â \
For the third time in the history of the
institution and the ' second time this
semester Stanford University, has been
startled by the appearance of a
"bogie." Tne appearance of the in
famous publication . twice in such a
short period of time is due to the num
ber of disturbances in the dormitories
and the consequent activity of the fac
ulty committee on student affairs to
put a stop to them.,
~ The publication appears this time as
a four-page leaflet. Its origin" is se
cret.. If the author, or, as it is hinted,
the ; authors, are apprehended, so se
vere is the^tone of the sheet, expulsion
will unquestionably follow..
To apprehend the . source of the
"yellow slip" is next to Impossible, as
has been- Droved by past experiences.
Upon the issue of the sheet for the first
time at tho university every establish
ment In" San Francisco and surround
ing cities and towns that boasted of a
printing-press, ! hand or otherwise, was '
investigated. The search, however,
proved futile. , The authors were never
caught. â¢ '
The leaflets were found to-day in the
proximity of all eating establishments
on the university campus and College
Terrace and the sorority and fraternity
houses." It contains much clever stuff.
In the words of the unknown authors
the sheet receives the following dedi
cation:
' "Bogle," published by the Associated Knock
ers (Semester. Limited) of Stanford University.
Issued as often as necessary and for the per
sonal edification of the student affairs com
mittee. . No connection witn common knockers
and not copyrighted. ' Not entered at tne uni
versity, or any other postpfflce. Not entered at
the registrar's or business office as second or
any- other class matter. Night watchmen,
mounted police and other hirelings our special
objects.
Every student and member of the fac
ulty who at any point in his or her "unN
versity career has been before the public
'eye receives due notice in the columns. A
particularly despicable feature is that the
names of young women students are
dragged before the .community by. the
publication.

QUARREL AN OLD ONE
Alleged Violations of Agree
ments by Land Reclaimers
Cause of the Difficulty
Special Dispatch to The CalL
REDWOOD CITY. Oct. 24.â The quarrel
between the Supervisors of this county
and the contractors and promoters wh^
are seeking to reclaim a valuable trueW
of land near Belmont has reached a
critical stage,' and the Supervisors have
ordered the District Attorney to Institute
criminal and civil proceedings against
the alleged offenders. The affair has been
a matter of much discussion before the
Board of Supervisors and it was mutually
agreed Jhat the contractors would
suspend all work until the merit of cer
tain protests has been . determined In
argument before the Supervisors.
It is now claimed that Contractor E. W.
McLellan, who represents H. May Pear
sail and others, has violated all of hia
agreements wit^ the board by damming
up two of the most important creeks ia
the district. These waterways, it is
claimed, are navigable and by damming
them it will be impossible to get' In op
out of Belmont during the rainy season.
In the prosecution of the suits against
McLellan the Supervisors have instructed
the District Attorney to associate ex-
Governor James H. Budd and Attorney
George C. Rosa with him." As the case
involves a very large sum of money and
prospectively an extremely valuable tract
of land the litigation will be hotly con
tested.

visitors to the prisoners will be lessen

Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO. Oct. 24.-â Judge Gear of
Honolulu, the chief counsel for Com
mander Lucien Young- of the Bennlng
ton, xrae before the court-martial board
at Mare Island the entire day, to-day,
concluding his presentation of the de
fer.se but a moment prior to the
adjournment of the court. Gear
dade a masterful argument for the ac
cused officer and did not mince mat
ters when he alluded to the criminal
Sr?'.Â«ct of the engineering department
cf the Pacific sauadron, or, in other
â¢words, the failure of Lieutenant Com
mander Bartlett of the flagship Chi
cago to inspect the engine-room of the
Bennington.
Gear drew particular attention to the
testimony of Commander Ransome,
v,-ho was one of the expert witnesses
for the defense, and used as a compari
son his opinions with those expressed
by Bartlett while the latter was on the
stand as an expert witness for the
prosecution. Gear said that Bartlett
left the stand at the end of his six
days' testimony practically discredited
as an^Â«xpert. Gear paid a high tribute
to the employes of the Mare Island
navy yard and other Government ship
building: plants, and bitterly assailed
the work done *by tue ship-building
trust, as shown by the testimony of
Ransom*, who declared that the poor
ness? of the work on the Bennlngton's
boilers and furnaces Is alone respon
sible for the disaster.
GÂ«ar read several magazine articles
en the life and record of Young, in
\u25a0which the heroism of the accused of
ficer was pictured in glowing terms.
The counsel stated that It was a blot
on the history of the American navy
that .euch an Incident as tne court
3iartial of a gallant man must be re
corded for the fu,ture admirals of this
country to read. In combating the
prosecution's claim that poor discipline
and over-pressure had caused the acci
dent. Gear dwelt upon" the testimony
of Ransome and the employes of the
!c^r yard, who stated that overheating
after deposits of oil had been allowed
to collect was the cause of the explo
sion. In reviewing the rebuttal testi
mony introduced by the prosecution on
Monday, by which an attempt was made
to show that the discipline of the Ben
nington was poor, he said it had re
rulted in no advantage to the prosecu
tion.
The statement of Lieutenant Com
mander Leonard, who also spoke In
high terms of the crew's efficiency, was
brought to the attention of the court,
and Gear closed this portion of the ar
gument by asking how the members of
the court could and Young guilty on
either of the two principal charges
against him when such evidence had
been introduced. Gear concluded his
argument with a high tribute to Naval
Constructor Holden A. Evans and Cap
tain K. J. Drake, who have been his as
sociate counsel in defending Young.
Prosecutor West will begin his sum
ming up to-morrow.

E. Pisk.ham'B Vegetable Compound.
How many xromen do yon know who
are perfectly well and strong? We
hear every day the same story over and
over again. "I do not feel well ; lam
so tired all the time!"
\./Wiss KateM*DonalcLfi
More than likely yon speak the same
words yourself, and no doubt you feel
far from well. The cause may be easily
traced to some derangement of the fe-
male orguns which manifests itself in
depression of spirits, reluctance to go
anywhere or do anything, backache,
bearing-down pains, flatulency, nerv-
ousness, sleeplessness, lencorrhoea.
These symptoms are but warnings
that there is danger ahead, and unless
heeded a life of suffering or a serious
operation is the inevitable resnlt.
The never-failing remedy for all these
symptoms is Lydia E. Pinkham's Veg-
etable Compound.
Miss Kate McDonald, of Woodbridge,
N J., writes:
Dear Mrs. Pinkham :
" I think that a woman naturally dislikes to
make her troubles knovm to the public, but
restored health has meant so much to me that
I cannot help from telling mine for the sake
Of other suffering women.
S For a lons time I suffered untold agony .
with a uterine! trouble and irregularities,
which made me a physical wreck, and no one
thought I would recover, but Lydia E. Pink-
hfiin's Vegetable Compound has entirely
cured me, and made me well and strong , and
I feel it mr duty to tell other suiTering women
what a splendid medicine it is."
JK yon are ill, don't hesitate to get a
bottle of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegeta-

STUDIES SHERLOCK HOLMES
AND CAPTURES THIEF.
Detective Ingenuity That Sir
Conan Has Not \Beaten.
Malodorous Cigar Used for Bait and
Larcenous Gudgeon Nibbles. :
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Having read about and studied the de
tective methods employed by Sir Conan
Doyle's celebrated' Mr. Holmes, It was
with gladness rather than regret that Jul
ius Beuelar discovered that his watch and
chain had been larcenously detached from
his vest while the garment was temporar
ily detached from his person.
"For here," quoth Mr. Beuelar to him
self, "is Incentive to me to ascertain
whether I possess power of divination
equal to that of Sherlock, or am equipped
with any sleuthlsm worth having."
The theft was committed in 'Mr. BeuÂ»
lar'e apartment in a lodging house at 757
Mission street, while he was making his
ablutions in an adjoining chamber. He
was absolutely without a clew to the
thief's identity, for his room opened on
the first-floor hallway 'and was daily
passed by his numerous fellow-lodgers,
any one of whom could have taken ad
vantage of the opportunity to pilfer af
forded by his Indiscretion in leaving the
door unlocked. So after conceiving sev
eral plans he finally determined upon pur
suing one that Sir Conan himself never
eclipsed In ingenuity.
Purchasing for five cents three cigars
which were unsmokable by any one with
sensitive olfactories. Br. Beuelar placed
them in the very pocket from which the
watch had been abstracted, hung the vest
on the very hook it occupied when it
was rifled, opened his door and left it
open, just as he. had left it when the
theft was committed, and then ostenta
tiously proceeded to the toilet chamber,
just as he had proceeded when the lar
cenist went to work. Several persons
witnessed his departure, but as he could
single none of them out for suspicion he
wisely refrained from saying or doing
anything that might lead them to sus
pect.
The plan worked like a charm. When he
returned to his room, Mr. Beuelar .found
that during his brief absence one of his
three El Ropos had disappeared. "Ha,
ha," he chuckled, "now to wait for the
giveaway." .
Hastening to the hallway he saw sev
eral persons, with fingers pressing n6s
trils, flee from the vicinity In which Wil
liam Hanson, a lodger, stood and puffed
a cigar. "Trapped!" hissed Mr. Beuelar.
But he ignored William Hanson for the
nonce, quietly went forth and borrowed
a policeman, escorted him to William
Hanson's room â and there found the miss
ing watch under William Hanson's pil
low. -
Police Judge Mogan gave William six
months' Imprisonment and advised Julius
Beuelar to apply for a position on Chief
Dlnan's detective corps, where talent such
as his would surely compel rapid promo
tion.

Abe Bloch was recently Imported from
Germany by his brother and given the
superintendence* of the tatter's meat mar
ket at Washington and Polk, streets,
.where he became engaged in flstlo alter
cation with Fred Landler, a Journeyman,
the cause of the combat being Mr. Land

Mr. Bloch suggested. The gentlemen
were arrested and booked for peace dis

William Smith and Bessie Dillman were |
sweethearts when a handsomer man
alienated her affection and she left Will
iam to deplore the fickleness of. woman
kind. Thus the situation existed last
Saturday night, when William and Bessie
met at Howard and Fourth streets, where
she was awaiting a car to transport her
to her home In the Mission district.
William coldly bowed to her and was dis
consolately continuing his way when she
expressed a desire to converse with him.
"I thought," she said, "you might . be
Interested to learn, that your successor
as ray steady went to Goldfleld some time
ago and has saved money to get married
on. He has sent enough to me to buy
wedding things and pay my fare to Join
him, and I have Just been around bidding
my friends good-by. . VYou'll wish me
good luck, won't you?"
William Instantly complied with her
request, and co grateful was she that
west-bound cars had ceased to pass ere
she remembered the hour was late and
her home remote.
"Goodness gracious!" she then ex
claimed, "here J have stood and talked
to you until the last car has gone by."
"Don't worry." said William, "you can
get an apartment for the night in .the
house" where I live,"
That was how Bessie came to be In
a Howard street lodging-house when
some one burglariously endeavored to en
ter her chamber/ She screamed, and, .
jcantily garbed as she was, fled via the
fire escape to the â¢ roof, where her shrieks
attracted Patrolmen Sullivan and , Flood
to the house.* As they dashed Into the
t~*u-*.Â» they met William Smith dashing
THE SAN FRA^
out of it, and they detained him until
Bessie's story was heard.
"I don't know whether he was the
burglar or not," said Bessie to Judge
Fritz.
"I was asleep in my room when her
yells awoke me," William pleaded, "and
I was trying to find out where she was
when , the policemen seized me."
"You would better depart for Golfleld
to-day," said his Honor to Bessie. "And
you," he said to William, "would better
bid her a final adieu ere she leaves this

Clarence Edwords, assistant city editor
of the Chronicle, was fined $100, with the
alternative of serving ninety days in
prison, by Judge Mogan. He was accused
of having fired a derringer at C. H. Har
wood with- intent to commit murder,' but
with the approval of the District At
torney the charge was reduced to that
of simple assault, to which the defendant
pleaded guilty. The fine was paid.
Edwords was acting as city editor of
the Chronicle the evening of August 20
when Harwood entered the 'reporters'
room and insisted on writing a sporting
article after he had been informed by
Edwords that it would not be accepted.
The defense alleged that when Harwooa
was ordered to leave the office he ad
dressed insulting epithets to Edwords,
who took a derringer 'from his desk ana
fired at Harwood, the bullet striking and
being deflected by a suspender buckle.
"It is possible," said Judge Mogan, In
response to the motion that the charge
be reduced, "that Edwords merely in
tended to display the pistol an a means
of enforcing the authority which, as city
editor, he undoubtedly possessed to com
mand Harwood to leave the office, and
that the weapon was accidentally dis
charged. It is also possible that in anger
provoked by the abusive language alleged
to have been addressed to him Edwords
fired the pistol deliberately. But the
charge of assault to commit murder has
not been proven by the evidence, and no
Impartial Jury could convict the defend
ant on that charge. Therefore I approve
the motion and order that the charge be
changed to that of simple assault."

Somebody told 14-year-old Mary
Donovan that Mrs. Kate Lawry of 45
Ritch street had audibly opined that she
(Mary) was "a nasty little sneak," and
when Mary met Mrs. Lawry as that
lady was returning: from a nearby
grocery there was a fight. Judge
Cabaniss, before whom Mary was ac
cused of battery by Mrs. Lawry, heard
both sides of the story and. as is his
almost invariable custom in the adjudi
cation of neighborly rumpuses, contln-
ued the case one month and allowed the
defendant to go on her own' recog
nizance.
Mrs. Lawry averred that she never
was more astonished in her; life than
when Mary accosted her and angrily
demanded a retraction of the alleged
slur, because she (Mrs. L.) had never
said a word derogatory to the charac
ter of any person residing] on that
block. Having nothing to retract, she
was unable to comply with Mary's jre
quest, and the next thing she knew
Mary was clawing her a ILL wildcat
apd the commodities with which she
was laden, including a paper bag filled
with grapes, were being trampled upon
the sidewalk. When the attack was
concluded Mrs. Lawry lay wallowing
in grape Juice. I
Mary's narrative differed In some de
tails from that of her accuse*. True
It was, Mary acknowledged,; that she

OFFICIAL BLOCKS PLAN
Refuses to Give Necessary
Notice, Claiming That It
Is Not His Duty to Do So
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 24.â A .petition for
a peremptory writ of mandated was filed
to-day in the Supreme Court ' by Charles
H. Spear, John.D- Mackenzie and' Henry,
J. Crocker, individually and as members
of the State Board of Harbor Comuis
sloners, against Truman Reeves, as Treas
urer of the State of California,- for the
purpose of : compelling him to '\u25a0'. proceed
to give notice of sale of 250 bonds of the
par value of $1000 each, authorized by the
provisions of the "San Francisco Seawall
Act," passed by the Legislature" of 1903.'
It appears. from the petition that all of
the Jurisdictlonal steps affecting the .'le
gality of the bond issue have been taken
but that the State Treasurer has refused
to proceed to give noticefof sale, as
directed by the act. claiming that It is
not his legal duty to do so.
The act referred to. provides for 2000
bonds at the par value of UOOO each, pay
able nineteen years after their date, with
interest at four per cent per annum.

PRICES IN MANCHURIA.
1 A
THE effect of the war upon prices in Manchuria is very marked.
Land has risen about 75 per cent, and the necessaries of life have
advanced 50 per cent. The commercial awakening of the prov
ince is everywhere in evidence. Japanese and other merchants, are
on the ground, and the farmers are getting prices of which they
never dreamed in the sleepy days gone by. .The. usual effect of, war
everywhere is to raise prices. War is destructive. It destroys, and
consumes at the same time that it reduces production. By eco
nomic law the vacuum has to be filled, and. as â¢ the demand: is out
of proportion to the supply the price rises. In some things, the
former low level of prices is not restored.
Manchuria is a very fertile country.* Its crops are those of
the temperate zone in this hemisphere. Prices reached their lowest
level there during and after^the &oxer rebellion. This was probably
due to the imperiled safety* of property and to apprehension which
followed Russian occupation and the subjection of civil adminis
tration to Russian military control. Now there is a feeling of safety
and security. Property rights are respected. The Japanese are
paying high rents and high prices for business property, and the"
commerce of the province is open to the world. The wages of labor
rise with the prices of the necessaries of life, and it seems likely that
hereafter, and permanently, wages will be higher than ever before.
The high prices of products call for greater skill in their production,
and as labor is first under the law, that conforms wages to productive
power, greater skill will send wages still higher. The effect will be
to more nearly equalize the wages of Eastern Asia with those of
the rest of the world.. The people in this country who have been
alarmed by the prospective competition of low wages in Japan and
China with high wages here have not taken into account the pro
ductive power of labor in- thel two hemispheres. With this will
come greater trade between the United States and Eastern Asia.
Dr. Jordan, who is the closest observer of economic conditions in
China and Japan, says: "Those without money and with nothing
to sell cannot buy. Give the Chinaman at home the chance that he
makes for himself elsewhere. Then China will be no longer a water
melon to be cut up by robbers, but a nation to be respected. Then
we shall realize the dream of Chinese trade. There is no trade with
a pauper state. It is said that our much discussed commerce through
the open door of Mukden is less than thÂ£ trade in eggs and chickens
between Detroit and Windsor, in Canada. To us of the Pacific,
in the trade center of the world, China will be our best customer
and Japan our most helpful mediator. A Chinese metaphor de
scribes China as the giant who crosses the river. Japarr the dwarf
upon his back. But the dwarf can see farther than the giant and
deeper into the water. So as they move along, to. the giant he
points out the deeps and shallows and depths in the stream. Some
day the stream will be crossed, the helping hand no longer needed
and the two shores of the Pacific will be inhabited by great and
friendly nations, whose mutual respect will be good for both, and
whose trade will be a source of mutual enrichment."
As this view was uttered before the report of rising prices in
Manchuria crossed the Pacific, the condition is confirmatory of the
prophecy. What has followed war and peace in Manchuria will
follow in Korea as the result of the hegemony of Japan. Enlight
enment will illuminate the hermit kingdom. Prices ami wages and
wants will increase and Korea will take her proper place in the
awakening of Eastern Asia. It is idle to say that Japan can do all
the trade and take all the profits. Her situation in the East is al
most exactly that of Great Britain in the West. . She will be. a large
buyer and a large seller, as Great Britain is. Di\ Jordan says that
less than half the arable land in Japan is under cultivation, and, not
withstanding the efforts of the Government to improve the me
chanics of agriculture, the processes followed are the most primi
tive. Japan has no wagon roads, inadequate railroads, no horses, no
cows, no sheep, no hogs, no butter, no cheese, no orchards, no vine
yards, no fruit, no turnips, cabbages, pumpkins, squashes, scarcely
anything to show in agriculture, except rice, tea, lacquer and silk.
From this may be measured the work of leveling up that has to be
done to increase the wealth and wants ot the people. In the doing
is education, increased skill and broader enlightenment.
WITH the death of ex-Congressman Simpson passes one of the
most interesting personalities that has appeared in American
public life. 'From his youth he was at the front, where storm?
were and battle. After good service as a soldier in the Civil War
he was a sailor on the Great Lakes, where he rose to be the com
mander of a merchant fleet.
He went into politics in the Populist movement in Kansas and
served three terms in Congress. In the House he was the most
noted free lance that ever sat in that hall. He was an intimate com
bination of the characteristics of Sunset Cox, Ben Butler and Blame.
He had readiness and aptness in repartee, power in epigram and a
saving common sense that made him a general favorite. When
the Philippines were under discussion he made an extreme speech
against our course in the islands. It went to the last limit and
roused the Republican side to a red rage. -r
The reply was made by Cannon of Illinois, now Speaker of
the House. He spared no words in denouncing the Kansan. In his
peroration he said that if Simpson's speech had been made in Manila
he would have been tried by drumhead court-martial and shot to
death as a traitor. The situation became intense and the sensation
acute. Instantly Simpson took the floor and said: "I would much
prefer being decently shot to death like a soldier in the Philippines,
to being fired at on this floor by an old muzzle-loading, rusty cannon
from Illinois."
' The sensation exploded in a roar of laughter and the House in
merry humor went about its business. A man less wise would have
taken Cannon seriously, and declaimed about the freedom of speech
and the guarantees of civil liberty. But Simpson saw the humorous
side of things, and when he left the House no scars nor grudges were
left inflicted by his hand.
Notwithstanding the wild political theories which he advo-'
catcd, he was a worker and a good business man. ' The whole coun-.
try will be glad to know th^t after leaving public life he prospered,
and that his family, for which he loyally cared, is left with a good
estate, thanks to. his industry and foresight. Of all the Populists
who were swept into power, he is most kindly remembered, and his
old colleagues in the House will be in spirit among the mourners.

DEEP ENOUGH.
BHss Carman, the poet, tells* the follow
ing:
Once when a Boston man and his wife
were visiting a resort near the Spring
field River they went out for a jaunt in
the woods. In some way the man fell
into a small stream, and as he was not
a swimmer he found Jiimself in consider
able difficulty. . Fortunately, however, the
stream was not deep. His wife gave vent
to a' torrent of tears .right Into the
stream. At this the ; unfortunate man
evinced fresh evidence of "the rattles."
Looking up at his weeping wife above
him, he managed to gasp out.

the river, or. l'm lost. It's deep enough
already."â Harper's Weekly.

ROOSEVELT: TO THE TEACHERS.
President Roosevelt,, "the best loved
man in the whole round world." as
Miss Blake called him In a burst of
enthusiasm, was plainly delighted' to
appear before the National Educational
Association, says Ossian H.- Langr, m
the Forum. He spoke as one who,
realized the important bearings of the
occasion upon the welfare of genera
tions of citizens to come. He regarded
the teachers as young Americas true
priests and priestesses, who arj shap
ing the Ideals iJt the nation :> be. He
talked about fundamentals; in a
straightforward way and In a .'spirit
of humane charity. His predominant
purpose seemed to be to "impress upon
his audience- the supreme duty of
heading the young in the right direc
tion. He" warned especially against. the
false notions of "success" which a
narrow commercial spirit has fostered
Into wide acceptance and which the
newspapers have magnified Into popu
lar, idols. These was no extreme state
ment. His phrases .were carefully
chosen. It -was the voice of wisdom
,that seeks' not after plaudits," but for
the" spreading abroad of truth.' "\u25a0
The teachers of -New York City, by
careful organization, strong- and per
sistent argument, and 'wise .manage
ment, induced /the State Legislature a
few; years ago to" pass the Davis-Ahearn
bill assuring to them something like
just compensation. Superintendent
Maxwell, then as now firmly believing
in Â£ good i pay * for teachers, placed the
whole weight of Â» his influence In sup
port of , the .'measure, although his board
of 'education "wasj arrayed against it.
Mr.: Roosevelt was Governor- of -' the
State at;the time, and when he signed
the bill ' he ; said: "Teachers -do - so ', im
portant a work for the State that they
should be ' encouraged by adequate
pay." That-as President of 'the United
States' he still adheres to this oflttilon
was evident' from his address at^As
bury Park., in : which he - exclaimed :
"You teachers -make ; the Whole world

Mrs. Robert Wilcox, Former

Lead the Island Smart Set
Â«
>SUE MEETS OPPOSITION
Claim That She Entertained
an Italian Prince Brings
Forth an Official Denial
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HONOLCLI', Oct. 24. â One of the
amusing incidents of the visit of. Prince
Ferdinando of Savoy on the Italian
cruiser Calabria was the rivalry be
tween the Italian society of Honolulu
and one of the Princesses of Hawaii
under the monarchy. It has led to
a semS-ofiicial denial By Italian Con
sul Lar.z that Prince Ferdinando called
upon or accepted the hospitality of the
Princess Theresa (Mrs. Robert Wilcox)
and warm assertions by the lady that
she not only received the Prince at her
Kapahulu place, but was presetted by
him with a locket with his picture^in
it and a tine bracelet.
In response to this Count Moriondo is
said to be authority for the story that
th* man entertained by Princess
Therrsa was a petty officer of the Cal
.'; bria.
It seems that the Princess did enter
tain a "Prince," whom she introduced
with much eclat to many Honolulu peo
ple as Prince Kerdinando. The func
tions which this "Prince" attended
were duly reported to the papers and
in one instance the account was
printed, with the result that the Italian
Consul denied that such had been the
case.
Princess Theresa was prominent in the
reception of Mr. and Mrs. William Jen
nings Bryan when they were here and
has excited a good deal of comment by
her assumption of the social leadership
of a certain set.
SHEBIFF MUST XOT
C/BSTJiUCT STREETS
Long Says City Official Is
Liable to Arrest in Evic
tion Cases.
City Attorney Longr yesterday advised
the Board of Public Works in an opin
ion to the effect that the Sheriff is
amenable to the law prohibiting the
obstruction of public streets just the
same us an ordinary citizen. The opin
ion was in answer to a communication
from the board named as to whether
the Sheriff could not be procefeded
ag-ainst when he places household fur
niture on the sidewalk while evicting
tenants who fail to pay their rent. The
furniture of a Mrs. O'Day was bllowed
to remain on the > sidewalk on Tehama
street, near Third, and complaints were
tiled regarding the danger from the
obstructions. Long's opinion says:
1 have been unable to find any law or
decision of the comae which gives the Sheriff
the rieht to use the public streets as a place
of ttorage in. ejectment proceedings. If tne
dispossessed tenant does not receive his jxt
# "niil property on the sidewalk the Sheriff
ji.ay not permit it to remain there and become
an iHeyal obstruction and nuisance. (Gaert
r.er vs. Bues 100 Wis. 109; the Commonwealth
vs. Miliiman, 13 S. & R. Reports. 403.)
.Yoa ar- accordingly adv:sed that it Is ynm
duly b* give proper notice to the owner aria
occupant of the house and the Sheriff to re
move said obstructions Jrom the . sidewalk,
and tbat if after the said notice is given
â¢aid obstructions are not removed within the
ttae epecified by your board it then becomes
your duty to remove thÂ« same: and youi
powers to proceed asrainst the Sheriff are the
tame as would apply to any other individual.
The Board of Works at once served
notices on Sheriff Curtis and also on
the owner of the house from which
Mrs. O'Day was evicted to remove the
furniture from the sidewalk and ar
rests will follow if their notices are not
obeyed. Curtis submitted the matter
to his attorney, who advised him to
remove Mrs. O'Day's furniture to a
warehouse, which was done.
>~>vr American Industry.
The "Nestor" Cigarettes are widely
known to smokers as the pioneer Egyp
tian cigrarette of America.
To better compete with the large
number of imitators who have endeav
ored to produce a so called Egyptian
cigarette at a lower cost, the "Nestor*
people are about to open a large fac
tory in this city:
They have leased 20,000 square feet
of /loor space and Mr. Nestor Gianaclis
of Cairo is in this country to supervise
the new factory.
There have already arrived in the
United States nearly 1000 bales of
â¢ Turkish tobacco direct from Cavalla.
This Is one of the largest, if not the
largest, shipments of Turkish tobacco
ever made to this country.
It is at Cavalla that Mr. Gianaclis
stores and ships all his Turkish tobac
co to Cairo.
With the same quality of tobacco and
with Nestor Gianaclis to blend and su
perintend the manufacture, the Nestor
cigarette of Oriental fame will be ex
actly duplicated here, with the advan
tage to the consumer of 15 to 20 cents'
reduction in the price per package.

JAPAN'S PLANS
IN THE ORIENT
Secretary Hioki of. Legation
at Washington Says Amer
ica Has Nothing to Fear
TALKS OF IMMIGEATION
Believes That Discharged
Solaiers Will Not Seek
Entrance to United States
CLEVELAND, Oct. 24.â Ekl Hioki, First
Secretary of the Japanese legation at
Washington, delivered an address to the
members of the Cleveland Chamber of
Commerce this evening, his subject being
"Japan, America and the. Orient." In
view of the fact thafHloki's address was
practically the first official . utterance
irbm a Japanese source concerning the
situation in the Far East since the close
of the war, it was considered as slg 7
nificaht, and attracted much attention^
Hioki said in part: - , .
Seeing that certain questions are receiving
more or less attention of the thinking class
of people in this and other countries it may
not ibe without value to express at this | op
portunity my humble views on them."
First â The yellow peril. In spite of the In
Suence which once it gained the doctrine of
the yellow peril seems to have lost its; hold
on men's minds, at least In America.
Second â Japan has no designs ori the Phil
ippines. If a bona fide statement of respon
sible parties fails to convince, let us try a
brief ' argument. Laying aside entirely for th.6
moment, for the sake of argument, the con
sideration of the' motive of Japan regarding
the present subject, let me ask you a ques
tion. Can you believe that this great Ameri
can people, who glory in their national spirit,
in their gigantic strength, in their boundless
wealth, in their marvelous development and
: who look forth with proud and confident an
ticipation to the time when they shaal b*
the Hist in the race civilization has set lot
man to run. would allow their flag to bÂ»
lowered, be it In the Philippines or any othei
place which legitimately belongs to her. by
any hands but their own? No, most . em
phatically no. That is the spirit with whlcn
you cling to your new possessions in th*
Pacific and that ought more to be the spirit
of the Americans than the . Japanese. There
fore, if Japan harbored such a sinister de
sign as is attributed to her she must bt
prepared to plung in a war far more gigantlo
than the one just ended, against a nation to
which Â«he owes much what she \u25a0is to-daj,
and whose people she owes that moral and ;
j financial support so unreservedly given at tne i
mo,?t critical period in her history. No; thÂ«
Phi'ippines are not worth the sacrifice of sucn
a valuablp friendship as that of America and
the enormous losses in men and money which
such a war would necessarily entail.
Third â The open door policy in China. ThÂ»
increased prestige of Japan turned the eyes
of the world toward the problem of what
Influence Japan will wield over China. With
out questioning the value of the principle*
contained- in the so-called Monroe doctrine oi
its applicability to the western hemisphere
at present, I can simply say that such an idea
has not entered into Japanese minds.
Fourthâ Japanese -influences in China arÂ»
beneficial to the whole world. It ia a matter
for congratulation for Japan, as well as for
all other nations, that there is a fair pros
pect of the increase of Japanese influence in
China as a result of her Increased prestige.
Fifth â Industrial and commercial develop
ment of Japan. The .last war with Russia
has increased the national debt of Japan ta
the amount of , $900,000,000. the interest on
which alone requires nearly $15,000,000 .-.an
nually. It is indeed a heavy, an enormous
burden and every dollar of it. Interest and
principal, must be paid.
Sixth â Japanese immigration into the United
StateE. It is seen frequently printed In news
papers that when the war with Russia it
over and the army of 700,000 men in Man
churia is disbanded, the Pacific Coast will
be flooded with Japanese immigrants. Such a
statement cannot be regarded as an expression
of a serious opinion, because, unless that
enormous army of Japanese had at once de
scended from the sky for the purpose of war,
there can be no reason why its disbandment
should cause any increase of immigration to
the -United States or anywhere else. Th'er*
ts every reason to â¢ believe that Japanse im
migration to the United States will consider
ably decrease.
Seventhâ The future of /the Orient. The
Orient, with more than half the population
and more" than one-third of the land of the
entire world, and with a commerce amounting
only to $3,000,000,000 annually, that is only
a little over one-seventh of the total trade
of the world, offers almost unlimited possi
bilities for future development."
Bontn Arraigned for Murder.
Chilion Bowen was arraigned before
Judge Lawlor yesterday on a charge
of murder under the indictment of the
Grand Jury and the case was continued
till to-morrow for the defendant to
plead. The matter was laid before the
Grand Jury because the attorneys for
the idefendant raised some technical
points regarding the jurisdiction of the
Police courts. Bowen shot and killed
W. W. Stephenson of Washoe, Nev., in a
lodging-house on Larkin street, where
he had been consorting with Stephen
son's wife.

Dillingham, wrote to; Dr. Sherrod, ,fe->
f erring to his advertisements in the
daily papers and asking for one of his
pamphlets. He got it by mail and
forthwith arrested his would-be bene
factor. Sherrod was ordered to ap
pear for sentence at 10- a. m. to-day.
The jury, on account of his genteel and
distinguished appearance, recommended
him to the clemency of the court.
Sherrod has been in trouble before.
Under the names of Dr. Lawrence and
C. Backus he was arrested on March
23, 1904, by Policemen W. H. Cannon
and E. H. Mills for having obscene
literature in his possession. He gave
his name in the Police Court as J. N.
Brown. He was convicted on the fol
lowing day and paid a fine of $50. Â«
This was the third jury criminal trial
held in the United States District
Court room, the first being that of
Cress Unger, in which the jury, dis
agreed, and the second that of George
Wright, who was acquitted. These two
cases were vigorously: prosecuted by
United States District Attorney Robert
T. Devlin and Assistant United States
District Attorney A. P. Black.
DENIS O'SULLIVAN SCORES f
SUCCESS IN SONG RECITAL
Renders Works by Composers of Sev
eral Nationalities, Aide* by Ae
companlat Frederick Maurer.
Denis O'Sullivan gave a song recital
last night In the Alhambra' Theater,
delighting his audience with gems
which might be termed songs-cosmo
politan, for. they represented the com
posers,, of several nationalities.
Among them were good" and quaint
old English songs, such as Purcell's
"I'd Sail Upon the Dog Star" and
Lawes' "When I Listen to Thy Voice,"
and several with words by Kipling.
Then there were Irish airs, old and
new, notably "The Emigrant" and "The
Wearing of- the Green," and two very
pretty things, 1 ; "The Birds Fly South"
and "The Pride of the RiTeys," words
by Patrick Bidwell (Mrs. O'Sullivan).
| The success of the recital' was shared
by Frederick Maurer, whose ; accom
paniments were masterful Interpreta
tions of the composers.
Ask the man who knows. The American
Cigar, made by Regensburg, is the best.*

CONFIDENCE IN THE BIG BLACKSMITH
MAKES HIM A FALSE FAVORITE
Rival Gladiators Will
. Eliminate Boxing
From Work.
Both Appear Ready to
Give Fight Fans a
Good Run.
The followers of the fistic game evi
dently have a great regard for that right
hand wallop of Al Kaufxnann"s. for yes
terday they were willing to bet 10 to 9
that the former Olympian would emerge
victorious next Friday night in his battle
with Philadelphia Jack O'Brien. This is
surely a false price, but 6O long as the
bettors are willing to take a chance, it Is
t:p to them. They make the odds and will
have to abide by them.
Not many big wagers have been record
ed so far. Most of them are of small
sums, made by frknds of the big black
smith who believe him to be the suc
cessor of Jeffries. Zick Abrams last
night took the O'Brien end of a $200 to
Jl6O bet. If this pace continues Kauf
mann win enter the ring a pronounced
favorite, though it does not seem, possi
ble.
Under the advice of Billy Delaney.
Kaufmann did no boxing yesterday, nor
will he again don the mittens until he
enters the- ring at Woodward's Pavilion
next Friday evening. The ever-cautious
Dtlaney has the youngster in grand con
dition now, and will see that no acci
dents happen to Al's hands before the
contest. Kaufmann's work, prior to en
tering the pugilistic game, was that
which falls to the lot of a blacksmith,
and as a consequence his hands are ex
ceptionally strong, and his bouts have all
ended so quickly that he has had little
chance to hurt them. This is a decided
advantage in his favor, for once a fight
er injures his hand he is bound to favor
the tender member in spite of himself.
Jack O'Brien ha's also cut out the box
ing stunt. His long: experience has taught
him that a man in the ring without two
good hands does not amount to much.
<~s unen knows that as soon as his op
p"onent realizes that one hand is weak.
and that he has nothing to fear from it.
and does not have anything to guard
against but the uninjured mitt, he will
wade in. Sparring was the only form of
exercise that O'Brien did not indulge in
yesterday. A nine-mile run from Shee
ns n"s to Ingleside was gone over in fast
time. The afternoon's work consisted of
bag punching, shadow boxing and a long
Fe.ssion at the pulley weights. Although
the exercise was a steady grind for an
hcur and a half. Jack finished strong and
did not appear to be effected in the least
by the strenuousness of the labor.
, The seats which were placed on sale at
Greggain's cafe, 112 Ellis street, yesterday
morning, started selling early in the day,
anil from all appearances, most of the
choice ones will be sold before the box
office opens Friday r.ight. I .
PITTSBURG MAY
SECURE NEALON
It begins to look as If Uncle Hank will
not be able to hold big Joe Nealon for
another season. But a short time ago.
the Boston American League manage
ment began to office up to the native
son and now comes Barney Dreyfus of
Pittsburg with 'an offer of $4000 if Joe
feels disposed to take a chance in the
city of smoke.
Offers are coming so fast to the big
fellow that he does not know how to side
ct^p them gracefully. He Is considering
tins latest one with a whole lot of care.
An offer of $4000 for a lad just after
breaking, into the game is some money
and if Joe signs with the Pirates he will
be the highest salaried lad who ever
left this league.
Nealon's ability to wallop the ball and
pick 'em up at first base as well as his
fame as a sprinter have set the magnates
of the big leagues talking. It Is hard
to get a great big first baseman who is
fapt en his feet as well as a good sticker.
Nealon has all these qualities and there
fore the magnates' anxiety to sign him
up.
Ncalon's folks do not want him to go
East and for this reason he is likely to
remain here or retire from the game He
has no reserve .contract with Harris and
therefore can play any place he

BOXERS STRIVE
FOR TROPHIES
The boxing tournament for the. Pacific
amateur athletic championship began last
night at the Olympic Club and a big at
tendance of fight fans was present. The
majority of the contests were very tame
and failed to create any excitement.
Now that the ordinary boxers have been
beaten the contest to-night and to-mor
row night should furnish better sport.'
F. Flores, an Olympic Club lightweight,
and James Bradley, unattached, furnished
the best bout of the evening. Both of
the boys are clever and the winner was
in doubt until the last minute, when
Flores put several stiff rights on Brad
ley's jaw, -which . won for him the de
cision. In the same class, Willie -Wolff
of the Ariel Rowing Club stowed away
Sam -Wlntraub, unattached, in less than
a minute of fighting. Al Lloyds, a light
weight, beat Frank Burns after three
rounds of "tame, scrapping." â¢"
Ed.. Ryan, also a lightweight, won the
decision from Joe McÃride because the
latter got chilly feet after having the
contest practically won. T. Kerwin, an
other lightweight, was given the verdict
over F. Forsi at the end of the third
round. A like" decision was given to
James Lint gar over George Cummings.
In the special class at 125 pounds, James
Ford, a husky youth, showed himself to
be a good one by. knocking H. Carr into
dreamland in two rounds. Sam Mcntz
lasted one round with Joe Kane. G. E.
Earley, an Olympic Club boy, outgamed
Ed._ Jacobs, for the decision. . In the same
class, J. Gilroy won the verdict from Joe
Duggan by forcing the fight: Neither
.youth'- knew 'the first ' rudiments of box
ing. â¢ \u25a0 ..,"\u25a0;. :.: ; ; v. '. . "- i
Among the featherweights, Mike Kut
chqs and J. Erwing furnished the real
slugging match of the evening. The boys
went at it^hammer and tongs, and at the
finish Mlk'e had a shade the best, of It.
The other bout was won by H. Carr, who
knocked, put James Bush in two rounds.
Eddie Graney refereed, while W. M.

I If Jimmy Whalen pitches baseball for
! the New York Highlanders as he did for
Uncle Hank yesterday afternoon, the
Gotham fans will be tempted to deed
him a sky scraper or a block of stock in
the subway. For, nine spasms, the Giants
were swinging their heads off and only
one. of them came through with a hit.
This lucky man was Van Buren and he
tore one over third base in the fourth
"Inning tnat was just fair by a foot.
Although Whalen was pitching a game
that was a marvel and a sensation in one
combination, there was hardly a shout of
applause from the assembled multitude.
It was the first Tuesday game played on
the Eighth street lot this season and a
fair crowd was on hand, though most
of the regular, steady fans did not know
that a game was about to be pulled off.
on this side of the bay.
Cates for Portland pitched a big league
himself, but an error by Atz in the very
first inning made it curtains for the!
Giants. Waldron beat out a hit and
Mohler soused a nice one to Cates, who
tossed to Atz in the hope of making a
double play. But Jakey failed to make
the sphere stick to his mitt and as it
rolled away .out to center, both runners
advanced a peg. Hlldebrand then re
sponded with a Texas leaguer to the right,
'garden that brought both home.
Only three Portland men reached lirst
base. One hit, the other was hit by a
pitched ball and the third was safe on
Nealon's error. All died there, not one
of them advancing as far as the 'second
cushion, for Whalen had a stock of smoke
and a variety of benders that made each
Giant look like a bush leaguer when he
came to the bat.
George Hildebrand was back in the
game after a. layoff of a week. His nit
brought victory home to the Seals. Mit
chell made a wonderful pickup of Wil
son's choppy grounder back of the first
bag in the seventh, furnishing the sen
sation of the day. Three double plays
helped to cut the time of the game down
to an hour and twenty minutes. The
score:

Special Dispatch to The Call. *
NEW YORK, Oct. U.â The card to-day,

which always proves satisfactory. Sid
ney C. Love won the Amagansett Stakes
in clever style by a length from Monet.
The latter was played 'from 4 down to
2 1-2 at post time. He got off- well, and
going out made the running a length in
front of Sidney C. Love to the stretch..
Then the latter went to the front and
was never headed, winning cleverly.
Gamara came strong at. the^end and got
third by a half length. The track was
fast. Summary:

that could be arranged. In accepting the
challenge, Joe Humphreys, McGovern's
manager, said:
"Nelson's terms fit us down to the
ground. We will sign articles with him
as soon as he says the word.' Making the
weight 130 pounds at 3 o'clock or 133
pounds at ringside .will !sult us. Of
course there Is practically no city In the
East where ' the bout can be held . but
Philadelphia, so it Is a pretty sure thing
that the big affair, will come off there."

"KID" WELLER
IS COMING OUT
Noted Layer and Plunger
Will Chalk Up Prices
at Oakland This Winter
FRANK ECKERT WINNER
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
As the air becomes crisp and the water
plpe3 begin freezing -up the bookmaking
brigade in the East are busy packing up
their belongings and heading toward Cali
fornia. Al. Morriswey. a popular and well
known layer, dropped in from New York
yesterday, and from the time hÂ« landed
at the ferry was kept busy disbursing
track gossip. Al says "Kid" Weller. ona
of the most sensational speculators of the
turf, will be out here this winter. Soma
years ago Weller was interested with
Joe Ullman on the Eastern tracks In the
"big store." No bet was too big, and
history does not relate that any of tha
plungers of that day made the firm rub
a price when once it was chalked up.
Kid Weller has made several fortunes,
and then again at times has been com
pelled to hustle for the price. Somehow
or other he manages to land right side
up' though.
Morrissey was instrumental In organ
izing tae Turf Benevolent Association,
and la very enthusiastic over its future.
The membership, which is limited to 230,
is composed almost entirely .oi book
makers 1 clerks. The Initiation fee Is $10.
withan additional assessment of $10. and
In one week J5OOO was raised. At tha
present time there Is an extended waitins
list. On the death of a member $2000 la
paid from the fund to his beneficiary.
The organization Is managed on the co
operative plan practically, none of tha
officers being under salary.
Billy Cowen Is again the heaviest win
ner of the bookmakers on thÂ» metropoli
tan tracks. %
Frank Ec-iert has enjoyed a very suc
cessiul season booking in the East, and
will cut in again this season at Oakland.
Bob Lloyd will also be back here again
to bang up his slate.
Although he has suffered some re
verses quite recently, Joe Rose Is report
ed far ahead of the Eastern game. - His
partner, "English Bill" Jackman, Is said
to be holding his own.
Leslie Cog-gins has returned after a
season spent on the New York tracks.
"Les" brought back "the smile .that
could not be erased," also a bundle of
the noiseless currency.
*Mack Burns, who introduced Barney
Schrelber to the bookmakins: business,
reached here from St. Louis Monday.
Alack put in the summer on the Middle
Western and Southern tracks.
E. C. Hopper, who will again preside
in the stand at Oakland, leaves La
tonia for California about November 1.
Several carloads of horses are expected
out this way from that racing 1 point.
Hyner & Knapp will ship -i string
of eight horses from New York to Oak
land. The latter horseman is tha
father of "Big Bill" Knapp, the rider.
From all accounts received, Charley
Henshall did not have a very prosper
ous season East. Charley recuperates
very quickly, however, and with a few
good breaks can soon roll up a bank
roll.
Steve l'Hommedleu has fallen from
his pedestal again. The plunger. 13
playing them from the ground at the
Southern tracks and Is not particular
about the size of the bet he makes. ,
Among the other heavy operators
that will be out here the coming season
Is Mont Tennes, the Chicago horseman
and bookmaker. Tennes will not bring
any horses to California.

Make Mistakelin Omitting
Contests With the Clubs
GAME MAY DETERIORATE
Practice With the Experts
From Other Sections Is
oi Benefit to the Sport
BY I* AUK IYIN'SLOW.
California r.nd Stanford have erred this
year In failing to arrange games with the
athletic ciubs, and if the practice is con
tinued for a few mere seasons the re
sult tviil be a marked deterioration in the
character of Western footbail. The ob
jections that iuay be presented against
-his class of contests are surely of minor
importance in comparison with the bene
fits that accrue when the varsities line
up against the club men.
An inspection of the scores for the last
five years will show that the Olympic and
Reliance elevens have always given the
collegians a good run far their money.
The games are of course purely practice
contests from the standpoint of the uni
versities, and as such are invaluable for
educational purposes. In point of team
work, interference, speea, endurance,
Epirit, discipline and condition, the elev
ens representing the clubs are usually
Inferior to the varsity squads, but in in
dividual ability the Reliance and Olympic
outfits are greatly superior in general.
The club teams are made up of men
who have made their marks in football.
Borne of the players have made the All-
American elevens and most of the others
hÂ»ve been stars of the gridiron some
where. Many of the clubmen have
learned the game under the best masters
In the and know football thorough
ly as It is played east of the Mississippi.
Each lineman and back knows all the
little tricks of his trade. He takes ad
vantage of his opportunity to wriggle
through for another foot after he is
caught. He Is aware of his chance to
gain through running strong or dodging
when about to be tackled, and he can
use his arms and elbows against the man
who is trying to down him.
CLUBMAN HAS CLASS.
On the defensive he gives plenty of ex
ample of how to tackle and smash up
Interference. The line man knows when
to lie down and grab an armful of legs
to stop a mass play, and how to avoid
his opponent to get through to grab the
backs. In short the clubmen have a
full allowance of what we call class In
athletics.
The university football man is theoret
ically as much a student of gridiron tac
tics as of different-al calculus, and in
the average Reliance and Olympic player
he meets a practical demonstrator of the
art. By keeping his eyes open the col
lege man will learn more football at first
hand from the clubman than he can In
any other way. By watching his oppo
nent each member of the varsity may
accumulate information that will prove
vitally important when it comes to the
championship contest.
In playing only with teams from smaller
institutions the university representatives
get merely practice and little information.
No- matter what ability the coach has he
cannot show his pupils the strong fea
ture of every position on the team, al
though he If probably able to do so for
the place in which he formerly played.
TEACH EASTERX GAME.
The club teams, composed largely of
Kastern gridiron experts, have proved
the principal medium of introducing
first-class football to the West. The
cartful coach can do something In this
way. but it is impossible for him to do
a great deal of it. Omitting the club
games will tend to make Pacific Coast
football eectional and partly obsolete,
which none of the -lovers of the sport
d<sire.
In every linÂ« of business and com
merce the Western man snatches eagerly
at any opportunity to increase his output
through taking advantage of his Eastern
neighbor's experience. His original meth
ods help him so much the more. In foot
ball California, and Stanford should col
lect all the practical information attain
able and then give the gray matter exer
cise on something nÂ«w.
It is folly for two great teams to be
spending the whole fall in learning what
they may acquire In three weeks from
the opening of the reason. The game out
here will retrograde unless the players
are allowed to observe all the new devel
opments. Let the racn get a foundation
with Chaucer, but do not send them to
King Edward's court with no further
knowledge of .English.

Volcano Sttl Active.

turo, - which arrived â¢ yesterday from the An
tipodes, the new volcano in Samoa Is still
active and the lava is gradually creeping to
the sea. \u25a0 ' ..
Afraid of Puget Sound Weather.
The British ship Burmah, Captain Jones,
which sailed yesterday for Victoria, left port
with six of her sailors in irons. Sailors are
very scarce at present or Captain Jones
would have put the mutinous seamen ashore
and shipped other men. Because they found
the ship was going to. Victoria six of the
new crew refused to work. They said 'they
could not stand the Puget Sound climate at
this time of year. Ordinary persuasion availed
nothing. The men would not turn to. There
are drawbacks to the enforcement of orders
while a vessel ia in port, go Captain Jones
ordered that the men who would not work
be placed in irons. When the ship gets to
sea, where Captain Jones will be absolute
monarch, the men will be released and he
and his mate will persuade them to earn their
wages. By the time the men in charge have
finished "arguing" those of the men who are
able will probably be delighted to obey
orders, and by the time 'the Bilrmah reaches
Victoria Captain Jones expects to have a
pretty good crew.

the contract yesterday for repairs to the army
transport Sherman. The bids, which were

Poultry and Game.
The Poultry market was heavily Â»tocked and
weak for everything except Broilers and Fry

the year.. "Hie receipts of domestic stock on
the early - express werÂ« 114 coops, and there
were further heavy > arrivals from, the Petaluma

car of Western that came in late on Monday
was, also on the marktt. \u25a0 A few. casea^o..
Dressed Turkeys came In and' sold at _lg-oc
per pound. . Fully 50 per cent of. the receipts
of Wild Ducks were seized by the Game War
den from dealers who had more than 60 birds
in -their possession. Retailers were afraid to
buy freely on that account and the market was
unsettled -in consequence. The quotations be

Batter, Cheese and Esrsrs.
The second session of the new Dairy Ex
change was even more successful than the
first. The attendance waa large, the dcslra
to do business general fend numerous sales wera
made. Butter showed a weak feeling, as there
were more sellers than buyers, and large lots
were freely offered by eell*ra at a ellght re
duction . from the quotations ruling' the pre
ceding day. Cheese, on the contrary, ruled
firm at about previous prices, . stocks continu
ing light. Eggs continued to advance and, al
though the bids for fancy ranch were ad
vanced to 40c. no sales were made, mainly be
cause there were none on the market to sell.
There were quite a number of sales of Eastern
and cold storage, however. The Egg market,
as far cs fresh California are concerned, con
tinues practically bare.
Sales were as follows:
Butterâ s boxes - extras, full-weight squares,
31c ; 5 boxes do, : 31c.

Deciduous and Citrus ' Fruits.
Table Grapes continued to arrive freely, and.
with a heavy carry-over on hand, that depart
ment ruled weak, notably for small packages,
the large open boxes being preferred by the
regular trade. Fine Cornlchon and choice
Black Fereras were In rather limited supply
and showed some little flrmn*Â«s, while prices
of .the other varieties had a downward ten
dency. There was practically no market for
Wine Grapes, the offerings consisting entirely
of odds and ends of low-grade stock, which
were difficult to dispose of at any price. The
demand for good Apples continued to Improve,
but values showed no Improvement, as stocks
were heavy and dealers were rather timid
about advancing prices. A message was re
ceived from Watsonvllle saying that growers
in that section were firm in their views and
were asking 4C@6oc per box f .- o. b^.for No. 2
Bellflowers. The other small- orchard fruits
were in limited supply and continued to com
mand good prices. There were^no large pack
ages of Ffgs received from the \u25a0 river, which
accounts for the lower range- of prices. 31Â»1
ons met with a sluggish demand and prices for
all kinds were low and Irregular. In the
Citrus market everything save Mexican Limes
ruled firm. There were heavy arrivals of
Bananas from the Hawaiian Islands, most of
the fruit being too green for immediate use.

GEORGE D. COLLINS IS BROUGHT BACK
AND ARRAIGNED FOR PERJURY.
George D. Collins arrived in the custody of Detective Gibson yesterday morning. and; was/arraij^
Lennon on the perjury charge. His bail wsas raised to $15,000. Collins was unable tofindbpridsmen" .and' was -kept at -the County Jail
lastnight He is in the best of health and .spirits and is -confident 'that he can beat his case.- ?, /y.- " > V . ;
Accused Lawyer Is
Much Improved
in Health.
Feels Confident He
Will Beat the
Prosecution.
Looking: better than he ever did, and
apparently In the but of eplrlts, GtoorgQ
D. Collins arrived In San Frandsoo yes
terday morning from Victoria, In charge
of Detective Thomas Gibscn. He Tras ar
raigned later In the day before Judge
Lennon, sitting In Judge Lawlor's court,
on the charge of perjury. His ball was
raised from $10,000 to $15,000, and not being
able to meet the requirement of the court,
was ordered into the custody of the
Sheriff.
"I left Ban Francisco because of my
wife's health," declared Collins with a
broad and cheerful smile. "I deny that
I was a fugitive from justice. My wife's
health demanded a change of climate, and
I would not sacrifice her health for any
body.
"I had Intended to go on East at first,
but I changed my mind. Yes. I did in
tend to Etay In Canada, but changed my
mind again."
"George and I are both broke," volun
teered Detective Glbeon. The remark
vai thrown in apropos of nothing in par
ticular.
It is over three months since Collins,
with th< aid of "Bogie"'' O'Donnell,
evaded the detectives, and left his bonds
men to weep and tear<hÂ«ir hair. At that
time he seemed almost on the verge of a
collapse. When he stepped off the Ore
gon Express at the Oakland Mole yester
day he looked young and healthy. His
checks were tanned and his eyes were
bright and clear. His expression denoted
hope and self-confidence.
"George has something up his sleeve
yet." remarked those who have a blind
confidence in his ability to juggle with
the law.
Collins still grasps eagerly at every
technicality. Immediately after he was
booked at the City Prison on a charge of
perjury. Attorney Louis Boardman, his
temporary legal representative, applied to
Judge Carrol! Cook for a writ of habeas
corpus on all of the grounds that had
been advanced before. The writ was de
nied.
COLMXS IS CONFIDENT.
When the accused attorney faced Judge
I>ennon he was the Collins of the old
days, debonair and self-confident. The
first thing he did was to ask for a post
ponement until November 2. He wanted
to interpose an objection, he said, and
would require that much tfme to prepare
affidavits. â¢ j
He objected to being tried by Judge
Lennon and declared that he would give
good and sufficient grounds for the ob
jection. He maintained that if Judge
Lawlor were prohibited from trying his
case he was also prohibited from ap
pointing another Judge to try It, and that
it should .have been transferred to an
other department.
District Attorney Byington declared
that there was no reason why the ar
raignment should not proceed, and the
court so ordered. Collins was given until
Friday morning to answer. He declared
that he would act as his own counsel and
asked that Attorney Boardman be asso
ciated T.ith him.
"I ask that the bail be raised to $15.
000." said District Attorney Byington.
Collins was on his feet in an instant

sibly be later on. Of course, we shall, continue to

now there is an unusual opportunity because of the
very large stock to choose from.
