SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, OCTOBER 15, 1904.
. Dispatches from the front give a vivid picture of the desperate character
of the fighting along the whole line. The Russian plainsmen have been
again forced to engage in hill fighting, which Is little to their liking. There
have been desperate and repeated attack3 upon almost inaccessible posi
tions, which leave no question of the resolution and gallantry of the Rus
sian forces. Guns have been captured and recaptured in fierce hand-to-hand
fighting, while a pitiless downpour of rain, the inevitable accompaniment of
a great battle, has flooded the trenches and drenched both armies without
allaying the desperate conflict^
The latest word directly from the field of battle is the Mukden dispatch
to the press, in which It Is said that 15.000 Russians had been wounded,
which, together with to-day's casualties, would make the total probably
exceed the figures of Llaoyang and make the fight rank as one of thÂ£
bloodiest battles in history. A pitiable feature is the coming of tho^
sands of wounded to Mukden. The roads and fields are covered with crip^
pled men, dragging themselves to the shelter of the hospitals, the wounded
helping each other, as few able-bodied men are being spared from the
fighting line. .
It must be borne in mind In reading the descriptions by correspondent*
Friendp of General Kuropatkin say the present offensive movement was
Inspired from St. Petersburg, as was doubtless General Stakelberg*s for the
relief of Port Arthur, and If Kuropatkin's star has set. others than he are
responsible. At the same time, the supporters of General Kuropatkin argue
that, whatever may be the direct outcome of the past few days' fighting.
it Is not likely to be an irretrievable disaster to the Russian army.
It is pointed out that even if General Kuropatkin was forced to advance
against his better Judgment, he is too good a general to have undertaken an
aggressive movement which he did not feel strong enough to carry through
without leaving open a road for retreat and while the Russian forward
movement may be an absolute failure, so far as the relief of Port Arthur
is concerned, and though Kuropatkin may lose many men and some guns.
this is the worst that can happen. If General Kuropatkin succeeds in keep
ing the alignment of his forcesâ and the dispatches indicate that he is doing
this and the Japanese do not succeed In breaking up or cutting off any
considerable portion of his army, he will not be in a much worse position,
even If he should be forced to retire to Mukden, than he was before the ad
vance began.
The probabilities are that the losses on both sides will be about equal.
LOSS EXCEEDS THAT AT LIAOYANG.
The depressing feature of the situation is that every one is willing trÂ»
believe the worst. Thus, reports from Tokio and elsewhere stating 'that
the Japanese are advancing and the Russians falling back, are accepted
with faith based upon the previous Russian retreats.
Naturally many reports are current as to the genesis of the forward
movement. It is stated that General Kuropatkin was forced into tak
*ing the offensive by pressure from the authorities here. This has been of
ficially denied and as General Kuropatkin's order to advance was given
over his own signature It seems likely that he will have to bear all the
responsibility, whether the situation is of his own making or not.
KUROPATKIN'S FRIENDS STILL HOPEFUL.
ST. PETERSBURG, Oct. 15, 2:30 a. m. â The great feeling of concern
which exists in high circles in the Russian capital to-'nlght by no means
equals the foreboding of coming disaster pervading the general public,
which is indulging In the deepest pessimism. In the absence of official
news the public is being fed on the wildest rumors of defeat suffered by
General Kuropatkin to-day- The fact that no word regarding the battle
has been, officially given out only confirms the popular fear. The explan
ation offered that to-day was a holiday does not suffice to allay the ap
prehension. .
General Kurooatkin's report of the result of the day's operations has
reached Emperor Nicholas at Tsarkoe-Selo, but It had not been returned
here before the War Commission, which sat only until 9:30 o'clock, ad
journed. The Emperor himself is represented as being bitterly disappoint
ed and spending hours with his Cabinet, studying out, with the help of
his military aids, the reports of the battle.
The general staff, however, by no means despairs. Though admitting
that the tide the last two days has been against General Kuropatkin the
general staff says the battle is not yet over and that in any event there
is no Question of a rout.
News From the Front
Disappoints the Czar
Wounded soldiers are being brought In from all directions. The roads
are crowded with long trains of wagons, baggage and transport wagons,
as well as ambulances, being pressed into service, even Chinese two
wheeled carts filling the -mandate of the military.
.Men afoot art limping: in, using: their guns as crutches, the less severely
wounded supporting their comrades after a first-aid dressing on the firing
line. Even across the fields you meet them taking the shortest and
straightest road for help and shelter.
It is the most pitiful feature of the bloody drama being enacted at
the front, when, stiffening with wounds, pain-racked bodies sink to the
roadside after the support of the danger and glory of the active. fight have
been withdrawn.
In the distance the sounds of battle are still plainly heard. The rain
has ceased and the sun is shining serenely.
MUKDEN, Oct. 14, 3:45 p. m.â The fighting has raged to-day with the
same bitterness as on the previous days of the engagement, and the result
is still in the balance. The losses on both sides are enormous, that of the
Russians being 15,000.
PEKING, Oct. 14.â Mr. TJchida, Japanese Minister, in
formed the Chinese authorities here to-day that the Jap
anese will endeavor before again pausing, to drive the
Russians off the Hun River, out of Mukden and probably
out of Tie Pass. He declared that the islanders have
never had the situation more thoroughly in hand than at
the present time.

In Mrs. Gregory's complaint Gregory's
name was given as "Edward H."â an
obvious attempt to conceal the insur
ance man's identity. She set forth that
they were married at New Whateom,
Wash., February 27, 1892. Recently, she
cald, he removed his effects from their
apartments and announced hfs purpose
cf not living with her longer, as he pre
ferred the society of other women. She
charged, too, that in his anxiety to get
a dl\*orce from her he had her followed
by detectives. This humiliated her.
The report of Referee Tyler contained
the testimony of Mrs. Gregory and T.
C. Hughes. The plaintiff said her hus
band packed up his effects on the eve
of a departure for New York, then
wrote her that he would not return to
live with her. His letters explained

terday granted a divorce from E. H.
Lestock Gregory, general agent for the
Aetna Life Insurance Company. Judge
Kerrigan accepted the report of Referee
James Tyler, and besides the decree of
separation awarded Mrs. Gregory the
custody of her daughter, Vivian, $150 a
month for the support of herself and
child and $150 for the services of her
attorney, Percy E. Towne.
An instance was related of his en
gagement one evening to play cards
with his wife and a party of friends.
He did not appear, she said, and later
she went to dine with the friends. They
were returning home between 1 and 2
o'clock in the morning when she saw
Gregory on the street with another
woman. The sight made her ill and she
was sent home. Nervous prostration
followed and she was confined to her
bed for two weeks. She says the cir
cumstance became a matter of gossip
among her friends.
Regarding the detectives that were
on her trail, Mrs. Gregory said that
"he was bound and determined to get
a divorce from me and to find some
thing against me, but he could not. I
did not believe him when he told me
he had employed detectives. He admit

The evidence of Hughes was to the
effect that Gregory had told him that
he intended to get a divorce from his
wife and was infatuated with another
woman. . Â»
"that he loved somebody else"; he had
tried to live with his wife, but '.'simply
could not, as his love for her was
dead." She told of his receipt of letters

The resolution of the Grand Jury and
an accompanying letter from Foreman
Lilienfeld were presented to Presiding
Judge Lawlor last evening asking him
to instruct the District Attorney to
prosecute the Election Commissioners
for misfeasance in office, in an endeavor
to have them removed. The Judge took
the matter under advisement, explain
ing that he wished to look into the law.
He would not say when he would be
ready to take action.
The Commissioners are not to escape
accusation of violating the law in con
nection with their appointments of pre
cinct boards. At a meeting of the dN
rectors of the Merchants' Association
yesterday it was decided to have
charges preferred by complaint in the
Police Court should Judge Lawlor or
the District Attorney's office fail to set
the machinery of law in operation.
The matter was placed in the hands
of the attorneys for the association,
with directions to act forthwith in the
event that either Judge Lawlor or Dis
trict Attorney Byington should refuse
to act. The .resolution of the grand
jurors, passed in lieu of an indictment
because a minority was able to block
the latter, is not regarded as 1 having
much authority in law to compel action,
and the directors of. the Merchants'
Association were determined that the
Commissioners should be brought to
account.
The whole situation as to uprooting
the conspiracy of ballot-box stuffers
was discussed by the association's dir
rectors. There was.a.vigorous.unanim
ity in the decision that every resource
of the organization should be expended
If need be to protect the purity of the
ballot-box. Without regard to politics
or any consideration whatever, the sen
timent was expressed by every director
that .there should be no let-up Â¦ in the
"When acquired, the parks and
playgrounds, embracing- three propo
sitions, will be cared for by the Park
Commissioners and the library site and
even the construction of a building
"We believe that it is important that
these properties, involving desirable
improvements, should be purphased
now. Real estate may enhance in
value, and under the limited author
ity of the bond issue, the Supervisors
might be unable, at a later time, to
meet the increased cost. Further
more, in justice to the property own
ers, an early decision should be made.
These considerations are apart from
the important one which actuates this
association to assist in promoting the
progress of. the city on lines of beauty
and adornment.
SHOULD BE BOUGHT NOW.
"These four propositions aggregate,
in round numbers, $2,000,000 and they
contemplate simply the purchase of
lands by the Board of Supervisors as
provided by iaw. They have been ap
praised by former City Engineer C. E.
Grunsky and the above estimates were
made by him.
"We are informed that it is the in
tention of the Supervisors, as soon as
thf bonds be taken, to bring con
demnation proceedings as the fairest
method of determining the exact
values, and that thirty days after Judg
ment shall have -been obtained, pay
ment must be made by the city.
"For the acquisition of land to be
used as children's playgrounds â one
south of Market street in the neighbor
hood of Seventh and Bryant streets,
and one north of Market street in the
neighborhood of Stockton and Filbert
streets, estimated to cost $740,000.
"For the acquisition of a block of
land for a free public library site in
the neighborhood of Van Ness avenue
and Fulton street, at an estimated cost
of $647,000.
"For the acquisition of Mission Park,
to consist of two blocks of land, for
merly the Jewish cemetery, bounded by
Eighteenth, Twentieth, Dolores and
Church streets, estimated to cost $292,
000.
"To the Honorable the Board of Su
pervisors of the City and County of San
Francisco â Gentlemen: As an associa
tion interested in the improvement and
adornment of San Francisco, we regTet
that certain contemplated improve
ments, involving no possible waste of
public funds, should have failed for
lack of buyers for the city's bonds.
Among the propositions voted upon and
approved by the people and for .which
bonds will be issued as soon as they
find purchasers we beg to call your at
tention to the following:
"For the acquisition of seven blocks
of land between the Golden Gate Park
and the Presidio, bounded by Thir
teenth and Fourteenth avenues, to con
nect the Presidio and the park, at a
cost estimated at $328,000.'
FOR MISSION PARK.
The offer is an important one in view
of the fact that when bonds aggregat
ing 55,600,000 were offered for sale by
the Board of Supervisors bids aggre
gating: only $277,000 were received. The
communication on the subject follows:
"SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 14, 1904.
The Association for the Improvement
and Adornment of San Francisco has
filed a communication with the Board
of Supervisors to the effect that certain
commercial and savings banks have de
cided to offer to buy a large portion of
the bond issue for public improvements.

investigation" of ttis frauds so flagrantly
committed on primary day. J
WILL GO "AHEAD WITH ARRESTS.
More arrests are soon to be made.
The case against Charles Wyman has
been made out well at the preliminary
examination now in progress in the Po
lice Court, and the directors felt en
couraged to go ahead with charges
against others against whom evidence
of "stuffing" has been gathered. It had
been deemed best to await the outcome
of the "Wyman case In order to learn
what kind of a showing could be made
in court with the evidence available.
The result Is satisfactory already, be
cause at no point has the prosecution
been weakened.
The attorneys are therefore to be in
structed to go ahead at an early day
with the other cases.
The work of the present Grand Jury
was also considered. Its indictment of
Adolph Steffens for illegal voting, of
Joseph Rebstock for misconduct while
serving as an election officer and the
demand on Judge Lawlor and tht Dis
trict Attorney to take steps against
the Election Commissioners were re
garded as evidence of an earnestness
to do something toward uncovering the
alleged conspiracy.
True, an element in the Grand Jury
appears to be trying to block the in
vestigation of the frauds. The dis
cord which broke out into violent dis
agreement and refusal of several mem
bers to participate in the finding of
indictments at Thursday's session Is
discouraging. It was a question, the
directors thought, if any further for
mal accusations would be made by the
Grand Jury in connection with the
ballot-box offenses.
But the directors were content to let
well enough alone and do nothing
toward urging a dismissal of the jury.
A new impanelment might result in
greater disadvantage to the campaign
against the alleged violators of the
purity of elections law. The present
body has at least not shown a dispo
sition to interfere with the prosecu
tions of the Merchants' Association and
the directors found some gratification
in this, for in the beginning serious
misgivings were entertained.
CAN ACT BY RESOLUTION.
The Grand Jurors who are seeking
to press the probing of the frauds are
willing to go ahead, although they do
not feel certain they will be able to
muster the twelve votes necessary for
indictment. If the course adopted as to
the Election Commission proves suc
cessful in the bringing of charges, they
can avail themselves of it in other
cases, for a resolution can be passed
by a majority vote. Should Judge
Lawlor and the District Attorney fail
to accede to the requests to institute
prosecutions, the Grand Jury can at
any rate give aid and moral support to
the Merchants' Association in its cam
paign.
If the minority of the jurors attempt
to have the Grand Jury dismissed by
order of court, as is planned, the ma
jority-will oppose the effort.
The following is the communication
submitted to Judge Lawlor by Fore
man Lillenfeld:
To the Hon. William P. Lawlor, Presiding:

WASHINGTON HEARS NEWS.
Japanese Legation Receives Cablegram
From Toklo Government.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 14. â The Jap
anese Legation to-day received the
following cablegram from Tokio:
"Marshal Oyama sends the follow
ing report of the engagement of
Wednesday and Thursday:
" 'In the direction of Benslhr the
enemy made repeated counter attacks
on Wednesday, but were repulsed. The
enemy showed a sign of retreat to
ward evening and our forces have as-
LONDON, Oct. 16.â All accounts of
the fighting south of Mukden that have
reached London appear to confirm the
completeness of the Japanese victory
and the only question discussed by mil
itary critics is whether General Kuro
patkin will be able to make as orderly
a retreat as he did from Liaoyang or
whether the Japanese possess sufficient
fresh reserves to undertake a success
ful pursuit, in which latter case it is
believed the Russians will be com
pelled to abandon Mukden. In this
connection, the Standard's Yentai cor
respondent, in a dispatch, asserts that
General Oku's army has occupied
Pachiatze, only twelve miles from Muk
den. It Is considered here, however,
that the Japanese advance could hard
ly have pushed as far as these reports
make it appear and probably the error
arises out of the difficulty of locating
places mentioned in various reports.
A dispatch from Tokio to the Stand
ard says:
"It is unofficially reported that thÂ«
Japanese right army has succeeded in
isolating a force of Russians in the
Bensihu-Kiaotoan district. It is ru
mored that Kuropatkin himself is with
the force, which seems doomed to de
struction. The central army captured
eleven guns and the left army twenty
five guns, while, the spoils of the right
army are expected to be still more val
uable. It is believed here that the dis
astrous advance was forced on General
Kuropatkin from St. Petersburg. In
any case his move was an unexpected
godsend for the Japanese army."
Nothing reliable has thus far been re
ceived concerning the fate of the Rus
sian force reported to have been iso
lated in the vicinity of Bensihu.
The Standard's correspondent at Yen
tai, under date of October 10, says:
"The whole Russian line has been
driven back over a distance of twenty
miles, and seventy guns have been cap
tured. Pursuit is being kept up by a
strong force on both flanks. There is
good reason to hope that Oyama has
succeeded in enveloping the enemy. The
cause of the Russian defeat is that the
Japanese army drove a wedge Into the
middle of the enemy's line. Prisoners
say General Kuropatkin personally
commanded the troops on the main
road and that General Mistchenko was
in command at Bensihu. A brigade of
Infantry and a regiment of cavalry
crossed the Taitse River, but found
themselves In a critcal position and're
tired to the right bank, with the Japa
nese in pursuit. The Japanese hurled
back sixteen counter-attacks upon
their right. The army lost 3000 men in
} the fighting around Bensihu."
TELL. OF JAPANESE VICTORY.
"Last night passed with the usual
intermittent rifle fire, capped with a
terrible. rainstorm, which added to the
discomforts of every one."
"Captain Michaels got the range of
the Japanese batteries later and two
of our shells put them out of action.
The Japanese then seemed to lose their
heads, swarmed out of the trenches
and fled. Our Infantry occupied the
position, but it was a harder fight than
Liaoyang.
"We are expecting a heary attack.
It is understood the Japanese have
strong reserves and guns of big cali
ber.
"The Japanese ran out of ammuni
tion and met our men with stones and
clubbed rifles in a bitter hand-to-hand
struggle. In the meantime Japanese
reinforcements and ammunition ar
rived. Lieutenant Grozdieff was shot
in the chest.
"We were forced to retire. One of
our batteries, having spent most of the
night in dragging its guns* by hand up
an almost perpendicular mountain and
ousting the Japanese from the crest
after a hard fight, was forced to retire
when a Japanese mortar battery got
the range of its position.
"We resumed the attack on Toumin
lineky under a hail of firing, especially
from two well concealed mortars which
we were unable to locate.
"Judging from the sound the heav
iest firing took place north of Yentai,
where the Japanese themselves as
sumed the offensive. Nearer the cen
ter it was quieter. We moved forward,
occupying some of the small passes.
"It should be pointed out that with
such an extensive front it is difficult to
say which position constitutes the real
center. It will be more correct to dis
tinguish the center and flanks separ
ately of each division.
'"Our losses on October 11 were com
paratively small. In the small ravine
where we were stationed the firing
slackened toward evening, but recom
menced after dark and continued, with
little intermission, all night. On Oc
tober 12 every one looked for a crucial
engagement, but though heavy fight
ing followed, the result remained inde
cisive. The Japanese advanced boldly
and attacked hotly on the extreme
right at Yentai and further toward the
left. All their attacks were -repulsed
with great loss. We also suffered heav
ily. The conveyance of the wounded to
hospitals was accomplished with diffi
culty, owing to the distance of the rail
way.
"The division to which I am at
tached deployed on October 13, oppo
site two passes called Touminlinsky,
eight miles north of Bensihu, and Hua
Pass, five miles west, each bounded by
high and almost perpendicular hills,
which held Japanese. Our troops had
tried on the night of October 11 to
take the passes during a storm. Lieu
tenant Grozdieff led another assault on
the Japanese trenches at the top of the
hill.
"The fighting on October 11 was fu
rious and continuous along a front so
extensive that it would be impossible
to give details from any one point.
MUKDEN, Oct. 14.â A correspondent
gives the following account of the
battle:
"Up to the present time the battle
along the whole line has been one of
varying success. We are now resting,
cold, drenched and weary, from a
heavy thunderstorm which began last
evening and continued this morning.
We hold positions captured from the
Japanese a.nd are awaiting develop
ments on the extreme east:
lt UN OUT OF A3IMUN1TION.
"Our men are displaying the great
est -bravery and endurance In the face
of all obstacles. Ouna have been
dragged by hand up impossible moun
tains. In one narrow defile the Jap
anese rolled stones on them. We could
not take the pass, but men scaled the
hill sides and took the heights com
manding the Japanese positions after
a stubborn fight. Our right has recov
ered itself. We have kept within
touch of our turning column, bo that
strategically we have a decided ad
vantage. In greatest contrast to the
veteran regiments that participated in
the battle of Liaoyang, the new re
serves from European Russia, in fresh
uniforms and equipments, with faces
untanned ' and unworn by". war, are
watchful, epergetio and determined.
: "I cannot â¢ speak" In* detail of the be-
BRAVERY OF THE RUSSIANS.
"From our turning column on the left
nothing; has been heard. We are
anxiously expecting news that it has
reached its destination.'
"From 8 O'clock in the morning the
fight raged. Along the whole line the
infernal din of the refle fire continued
as on the previous day, but up to noon
the Japanese batteries gave no sign
of life. It ' developed that they were
waiting to locate our positions before
opening fire. Even after they com
menced it was not so heavy as the
previous day's bombardment.
"Far to the westward the Japanese
are trying to work around our flank,
but there we are safe and have suffi
cient forces to meet them. Two simul
taneous turning movements are pro
ceeding, their's and our's.
"Reports of heavy losses during the
night attack- are coming in. The
Tomsk Regiment suffered terribly. Of
the brilliant Tamboff Regiment few re
main. The troops fought like heroes
throughout the hours of darkness and
the morning found most of them dead
on the ground they had bravely de
fended. Those .remaining continue to
fight. In the big village before us the
remnants of -several regiments, after
repelling attacks throughout the night,
ensconced themselves in the shelter of
the walls of the houses, prepared for a
fresh day's work.^
"The Japanese* attack on Temple
Mountain began at 8:45 o'clock in the
morning, but our batteries on each side
kept them in view and repelled the at
tack. The attack was repeated at 10
o'clock and finally at noon ""> general
commanding ordered a retirement from
the position, going .to Shikhl. We
had scarcely left the hill before it vas
filled with Japanese projectiles. At
Shikhi we met. General Zalinsky, who
had come to report. Then an aid gal
loped up with the news that the Jap
anese had driven us from the railroad
i on the west, but had not followed up
the temporary advantage, stopping to
cook their noonday .meal. Late at
night we caught them at a disadvan
tage and the Mornshensk Regiment
paid them with interest for their suc
cess .of the morning.
DIN OF THE RIFLE FIRE.
SOUSZOUTAM (twelve miles south
of Mukden, on the railway, Oct. 13 (de
layed in transmission).â A Russian cor
respondent telegraphs as follows:
â¢ "For over two days the battle has
raged ceaselessly. It was close to mid
night of October 10 when the Japanese
attempted to surprise and attack our
frontal positions in the impenetrable
darkness and hurled the full force of
their battalions against our intrench
ments. The darkness was split by the
blaze of their rifles and the answering
volleys of our men. The attack never
ceased for hours. We lay close, hug
ging the intrenchments, with but a few
minutes of respite, every man's gun to
his shoulder, firing at the flashes until
near dawn, when the evil-boding rifle
fire ceased and even the distant batter
ies were silent. We watched the day
light break in bands of red and yellow.
The clouds, seemingly tinged with
streaks of blood, hung over the silent
valley, which might have been empty
for all the signs of life it gave, while
from the plain below us rose dark and
silent hills, like the silhouettes of tomb
stones through the half-light. The fog
thickened, covering low-lying places.
Nothing could have better suited for
to-day's duel between two races.
"Day had hardly lightened the slope
of the two-horned mountain when our
batteries began to cover it with shrap
nel. Puffs of white smoke marked the
.landing of each shell. With the
naked eye we could see the Japanese
being shelled out of their trenches.
First one and then groups of three
and four black figures sprang into
view, squatting down, running for
cover or scurrying away among the
rocks, but the shells followed them,
tearing up the rocks..
-"Japanese fell literally like wheat
thrown by, the hand of a sower. On
the. mountain beside the Buddhist tem
ple our battery was also working. Then
another opened from the opposite side.
The Japanese fled so .quickly . that the
gunners could hardly follow them.
Soon Japanese resourcefulness showed
itself. 1 They fired the big native village
on the side of the two-horned moun
tain, rightly guessing that the wind
from the east would carry the smoke
toward us, making a screen for them
and confusing the aim of our gun
ners.
Reports from the left, however, only
bring the situation up to yesterday af
ternoon. A high officer of the general
staff says that the situation, while crit
ical, is not desperate. Kuropatkin is
keeping his head and acting cautiously,
as is shown by his withdrawal of both
wings in the belief that the Japanese
assaults will exhaust themselves. He
says the slaughter was frightful. No
estimate of the losses is yet possible,
but they run far into the thousands.
The losses were especially heavy on
the Russian left and center. In a single
regiment, out of more than a hundred
officers, only eight escaped.
The same authority says that no in
formation has been received here tend
ing to confirm the report that the Jap
anese are likely to cut off a force on
the Russian left. Neither is the threat
ened enveloping movement against the
Russian right greatly feared, Kuro
patkin having a large number _of Cos
sacks on his right; held in leash to
meet just such a contingency.
It is now evident that Kuropatkin's
plan was to press his advance not di
rectly from the front, but toward the
left for the purpose of getting in the
rear of Oyama's triangle.
SITUATION IS CRITICAL).
A later dispatch from General Sak
haroff, sent at 6 o'clock this morning,
explains more of the operations' of Oc
tober 12 and 13, in which it appears
that the Russian center was due north
of the Yentai mines, the right running
west a short distance beyond the rail-;
road and the left sweeping southeast
ward toward Bensihu. The real bloody
work did not. begin until Wednesday,
when the Japanese made a series of de
termined attacks on Sialiupedzy, about
seven miles north of Yentai, but the
Russians, .held off their assailants. In
the meantime, however, the extreme
right, comparatively lightly held, was
forced back, thus compelling Kuropat
kin to. slightly draw back his line above
Yentai in. order to preserve its align
ment. .... ._,.'.
: On, the extreme left, after a'deter
mined resistance, the Russians 'suc
ceeded in " carrying the rocky heights
and Hua Pass, north of Bensihu, : but
the arrival of Japanese reinforcements,
Kuropatkin says, made it impossible
for the Russians to press their advan
tage here and as the left was now too
far advanced, it also . was withdrawn
some distance.
ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. 14.âAn
other dispatch from General; Sakharoff,
dated early this morning, says regard
ing the fight of October 12 and 13 that
the Russians on the right 1 wing de
fe'nded their advanced positions and
also portions of the different; main po
oitions, particularly in the direction of
Sialiupedzy, "until toward % evening,
when Kuropatkin ordered them to
withdraw a short distance. In spite of
the fact that the Japanese attacks
were chiefly directed against these
troops they held the ground to which
they retired.
On the left wing, after a very ob
stinate struggle, the Russians occupied
the rocky hills south of Bentsiaputze
and near Bensihu, about eighty miles
north of Yentai, but the arrival - of
large Japanese reinforcements prevent
ed them from profiting by this success,
and as this body was separated from
the rest of the troops Kuropatkin or
dered It to retire.
FORCE RUSSIANS RIGHT BACK.
"The left column of the left army
occupied a line from Heilintun to
Fuchlatien.
"Our fresh reinforcements are con
stantly arriving at Yentai and In that
vicinity."
"The center column of the left army
is now attacking Shchopo. The right
column of the same army is attacking
Huanghuatien. After sunset part of
the right wing of the left column at
tacked Lluchenpo and another ' part
occupied Wanchlayuatzu. : . .
"The center column of the right army
is now attacking a strong: body of the
enemy*
"The right wing of the left column Of
the- right army, after a desperate battle,
occupied the northern height of Shao
takou, the key of the enemy's position.
"The attack movement of the center
army is proceeding satisfactorily. The
forces have occupied the heights north
of Huchiakuchiatzu and Manchuafun.
"The attack movement of the right
army, owing to topographical difficul
ties, is not proceeding as desired.
"The right column of the center army
commenced its attack movement at 10
o'clock in the morning agaipst a height
north of Huchiakuchlatzu. At 2 o'clock
the enemy's artillery, began retreating.,
"The right column of the left army
occupied Panehiapo on the morning -of
the 13th. Its advanced force has al
ready reached Pachiatzu. This column
has been reinforced from the supports
now attacking a division of Russians
in the rear of Huanghuatien, but the
state of the fighting is uncertain.
"Several batteries of Russian artil
lery posted at' Chianhuangchiatien
made a stubborn resistance and part
of our supports attacked them with ar
tillery. The attack is proceeding satis
factorily.
"The pursuing force of the center
column of the left army occupied
Liesanchiatzu and is now pursuing the
enemy toward Koduitun.
"The right wing of the left column is
now attacking the enemy at Hung
linpo."
3:20 p. m. â A report dispatched from
the battlefield last night covering the
progress of the fighting since the fore
going report is as follows: . "".. .
"The right column of the right army
was facing a strong force of the enemy
at Chaohsienlin, but after the arrival of
reinforcements our progress there im
proved.
"Our force in this direction began the
attack early this morning, but the
latest stages of the operation have not
been reported.
"A large cavalry force, commanded
by Prince Kanin, made a detour of the
enemy's left flank in the rear of Ben
sihu and put the enemy's supports in
great confusion, thereby helping our
movement in this direction. Kanin's
cavalry will again advance toward the
rear of the enemy.
"The right column of the right army
is now attacking the enemy at Chaoh
sienlin. The center colurnn of the same
army occupied the surrounding heights
of Lienhua and Maerh mountains. The
left column is now attacking a rem
nant of the enemy's force on a height
north of Shaotakou. . . ,
TOKIO, Oct. 14, 1:30 p. ra.-An ex
tended report from the Manchurian
headquarters reached Toklo during the
night. It records severe fighting dur
ing yesterday and additional Japanese
gains.
The contest around Bensihu con
tinues to be undetermined.
Yesterday a force of Japanese caval
ry, commanded by Prince Kanin, made
a detour of the Russian left flank in
the rear of Bensihu and partially scat
tered the Russian supports.
The report is as follows:
"Several attacks of the enemy, made
in the direction of Bensihu, have been
repulsed. The enemy showed signs of
retreat at 5 o'clock in the afternoon.
It is stated, at the Navy Department
that the mail pouch referred to did not
contain any official communications.
simply mail for the men aboard the
ship.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14. â It devel
oped to-day that a pouch containing
mail for the United States cruiser
Cincinnati, then, at Nagasaki, Japan,
which was aboard the British gteamer
Calchas when that vessel was seized
by the Russian Vladivostok squadron,
had been opened while in the possession
of the Russian officials, subsequently
resealed and sent on to its destination.
This information came to the Post
omce Department to-day in'a communi
cation from the Japanese Postal Ad
ministration, in conformity with a
practice always followed when there
has been any mishap in the delivery of
mail pouches.
The matter will be referred to the
State Department for action, as was
done with the case of the ordinary
United States mail on the vessel at the
time she was seized.
This latest phase of the seizure of the
Calchas mails haa caused a painful sur
prise in official circles, and if the
action of opening the pouch addressed
to the Cincinnati was wittingly done,
the probability is that a second pro
test will be lodged with the Russian
Government. Â¦ ..
New Phase of the Seizure
of Steamer Catenas Comes .

Tribute Is Paid to Bravery
and Endurance of the
Russian Troops.
At 11 o'clock in the morning the bat
tle reached a stage of severity three
times greater than that of yesterday,
*olid masses of troops filling up the
front.
At 2:20 p. m. the Japanese were oc
cupying a hill two miles to the south
of Hungpas Hill, which they shelled
from a battery which was plainly vis
ible. The results of the shelling were
not Important.
At 4:15 p. m. the Russian army made
an orderly and timely withdrawal, fol
lowed by a furious rifle fire from the
Japanese.
The Red Cross surgeons are perform
ing operations at Siulintzu railway sta
tion. Many of the wounded werÂ« load
ed on trains which moved north during
the day.
At sundown the cannonading to the
southwest could be heard constantly.
The Russian rear guard was holding
its ground at nightfall.
The Japanese proved their ability to
utilize the strong position at the Yen
tai coal mines, which the Russian ad
vance guard reported had not been
utilized up to October 10. The Rus
sians moving in that direction were un
able to occupy the position owing to
the developments of the past forty
eight hours, and fell back in confor
mity with previous plans.
To the westward there is a growing
activity, and the smoke from the shells
forms an almost impenetrable haze,
hiding the operations of the infantry.
There was an entangled artillery duel
in the vicinity of Tousanpu, to the
westward, in which during the day one
regiment was caught by a cross fire
and threatened with extinction.
Tousanpu wavered until noon, when
the Japanese made good their occupa
tion, and Colonel Stackovitch, who had
made a magnificent stand for four
days, after more than twenty of his
officers had been put out of action, fell
back before the terrible onslaught of
the Japanese.
RUSSIAN ARMY WITHDRAWS.
The result of the fight was that a
mile of ground along the front west of
the railway was lost, but the Russians
regained the ground during the night
by a bayonet attack, without a shot
having: been fired.
The battle was renewed at dawn to
day with terrible effect. The eastern
army evidently is engaged in continu
ous smallarms fighting. There can be
heard the desultory breaking of shells
along the fo.thills about five miles from
the railway.
SLAVS MAKi; XlfiHT ATTACK.
The battle at that moment was beet
observed from Hungpas Hill, two miles
southeast of Siulintzu. Both the Japa
nese and Russian batteries were dis
tinguished by the clouds of dust which
were raised by the concussions.
By the evening of the 11th 600 wound
ed had reached the field hospital, situ
ated at the Siulintzu railway station,
ion miles from the front.
The most fierce and most important
fighting that has taken place since the
l>attle of Liaoyang reached its height
at noon to-day, when after a bold at
tack which lasted for three days the
Russians began a sagacious retirement
from the positions they held yesterday,
and the Japanese by a strong central
movement forced the Russian lines five
miles to the north.
The battle reached a etage of un
usual severity on October 11. along the
railway and to the westward, culminat
ing in the vicinity of Tousanpu.
The line* are in contact from the
vest to the east, and the opposing
armies are in a square frontal fight.
Contrary to former plans, the ad
\ance of the Japanese, which had been
pushing up the Liao Uiver as though
with a determination to turn the Rus
sian right flank, has now crossed the
Hun River.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE RUS

military situation. The Novostl
frankly characterizes it as a defeat,
basing its estimate on reports from
the front up to October 12. The paper
says, however, that the defeat is by no

battle ends.
RUSSIAX PRESS HOPEFUL.
ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. 14.â Th*
Emperor has received tbe following: dis
patch dated yesterday from General
Kuropatkin:
"Two regiments of the Russian right
on October \2 sustained heavy losses.
The commander of one was killed and
the brigade commander was wounded.
Both regiments were compelled to
withdraw, abandoning their artillery,
but subsequently, under Colonel Van
novsky, who temporarily assumed com
mand of the brigade, they, after a
desperate assault, regained possession
of the guns with the exception of six
teen, which remained in the hands of
the Japanese.
"The final issue of the battle "Wednes
day on this flank was unsuccessful for
us. On account of a night attack of
the Japanese, who executed a turning
movement, oar troops were forced not
only to abandon their positions, but
again lost the guns previously recover
ed from the Japanese. Our forces re
tired to the position previously pre
pared on the Shakhe River."

After his cremation in Oakland,

his former home in Germany. On the
way she was taken sick and died in
an Omaha hospital. Papers found In

accompanying her dead husband's
body and a search was promptly in
augurated for the corpse. Telegrams
were sent forward to Chicago and New

The Minister of Foreign Affairs of
Panama asked the American Minister
to tell the President and Secretary Hay
that Panama would do nothing to irri
tate Colombia and asked for no terri
tory beyond the old boundary. Panama
denied emphatically that it has granted
any concessions to Panamanians or
Americans to exploit the valley of
Atrato.
Much satisfaction is felt at the strong
probability of an early agreement be
tween Costa Rica and Panama re
garding their boundary dispute. Le
onidas Pacheco, special envoy of Costa
Rica to Panama, has returned to his
country bearing Panama's official state
ment of what concessions Panama is
willing to make. At one time there
was danger that Costa Rica would
break off negotiations and that a clash
would occur on the border.
A settlement of the differences be
tween the United States and Panama
in regard to the main question of sov
ereignty and the collection of customs
duties in the zone, as well as the dis
pute concerning the postal systems of
the United States and Panama, will
soon be reached and probably embodied
in the form of a protocol.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14.â If Colombia
will take the Initiative there need be no
further fear of a boundary dispute with
Panama. The United States Minister
to Panama has reported to President
Roosevelt and Secretary Hay that Pan
ama is making no further contention
over the boundary and is willing to ac
cept without dispute the old demarca
tion of the department of Panama.

SAN^ JOSE, Oct. 14.â Telling her
mother that she was going to San
Francisco to attend a matinee Miss
Delmas Walter, one of the prettiest
girls in San Jose, and Herbert Martin
of San Francisco went to Fresno and
were married. The engagement had
been announced some time ago and
preparations for a swell wedding were
being made by her family. News of
the marriage was given by Father
Walshe of St. Joseph's Church in this
city, who had been notified by tele
phone by the clergyman .who per
formed the ceremony.
When the engagement of Miss Wal
ter and Martin was announced no time
was set for the wedding. Martin was
here Tuesday and Miss Walter accom
panied him ostensibly to San Fran
cisco, saying that they would
attend a matinee there that day
and that she would then visit
that day and that she would then visit
friends for several days. The young
ccuple, however, changed their plans
and went to Fresno, where they were
married yesterday by Rev. Father. Mc-
Carthy. Soon as the marriage was per
formed Father McCarthy called up Fa
ther Walshe and asked him to tell Miss
Walter's fa"mlly. Fresno, was selected
because Miss Le'nore O'Neill, who was

Short opened his address by saying
that he always liked to talk on Repub

recent national conventions, being a
member of one and a spectator at the
other. He was instructed and enter

he said, and amused at the Democrat
ic convention. He took up the Demo

is a dangerous man ana told of Con

SACRAMENTO. Oct. 14. â The po
litical sentiment of Sacramento voters
was shown to-night by rival excur
sions, the Democrats running an ex
cursion to Woodland and the Repub
licans an excursion to Folsom. The
latter excursion was given as a dem
onstration in favor of Duncan E. Mc-
Kinlay. The relative size of the ex
cursions justified the claim of the Re
publican managers that the capital
city is in line for McKinlay. The Fol
som train was crowded, fully 350 en
thusiasts filling the coaches, while but
200 Sacramentans made the trip to
Woodland to hear the Democratic
nominee.
The "Rough Riders" headed by the
Native Sons' band paraded to the Mc-
Kinlay train and raised the enthusi
asm to a high pitch and an immense
crowd at Folsom accorded the party
leaders an ovation. Addresses were
made by the local candidate, the

Speeehmaking Begins to Tell on Demo
cratic Vice Presidential Candidate.
PARKERSBURG, W. Va.. Oct. 14.
Four days of continuous speechmak
ing Is beginning to tell on the vocal
powers of Henry G. Davis, Democratic
Vice Presidential candidate. Aside
from hoarseness, however. Davis
seems as fit as when he began his
continuous performance tour of his
own State.
"I am sure that If Alton B. Parker
shall be elected President he will en
deavor to have the DeDartment of
Commerce and Labor divided and see
to lt that a practical labor man, a
genuine and intelligent representative
of labor interests, will have the place
devoted to labor Interests, as waa
originally intended, and a man de
voted to the Interests of commerce at
the head of the commerce depart
ment."
This was David B. Hill's contribu
tion to the campaign to-day. To it he
added: "Our candidate for President,
while always impartially enforcing the
laws, has always been friendly to the
interests of those who work."
DAVIS LOSES HIS VOICE.
McLachlan recalled how the admin
istration of Harrison paid off more than
a quarter of a billion of the national
debt, and how under the next Demo
cratic administration the nation went
over a quarter of a billion in debt.
When McKlnley assumed the reins,
said the speaker, and a protective
tariff was established, immediately the
prosperity returned.
McLachlan then described the efforts
to defeat the Dingley bill. He said he
was employed by the Chamber of Com
merce of Los Angeles County to stay
in Washington to look after the inter
ests of the producers of Barlow's dis
trict when the Dingley bill was framed.
The bill was passed, said McLachlan,
but he had to sit up In the gallery In
the House of Representatives when it
came up and see his Congressman
vote against it. He then urged the
voters of this district to stand by Dun
can McKinlay and see that he is sent
to Washington, or they might find
themselves in Just the same position as
the voters in the old Sixth during the
tariff revision.
The meeting was closed by three
rousing cheers for Roosevelt and Fair
banks and Duncan E. McKinlay.
a good, clear voice and held the au
dience to the end. He called attention
to the campaign of 1S92, and said-that
this campaign is like It. Then, he said,
the" Democrats said to the voter: "Put
us in power and we will tear down this
Republican protection, and then you
can buy a suit of clothes for one-half
what you are now paying." "You can
remember,"' he said, "what happened
after the election of 1892, when we
found Cleveland in the President's
chair and a Democratic Congress. You
know what hard times the country had
during Cleveland's administration."
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 14. â A steady
rainfall kept most people Indoors this
morning, but it had little effect on the
canvass of Duncan E. McKinlay, the
candidate for Congress, who put in the
time to good effect in meeting the
business men and their employes.
McKinlay met hundreds of Sacra
mentans. during the day and made
friends as rapidly as he was intro
duced. At noon McKinlay made his
second address to the men at the rail
road shops. He spoke of the certainty
of success for President Roosevelt,
who. will, he said, carry California by
60,000 majority. The voters were
warned, however, of the effort being
made by the Democrats to secure six
teen additional votes in the House of
Representatives, to control that body
and hamper the admlnstration of Pres
ident Roosevelt. The differences be
tween the two great parties, as ap
plied to the working men, were fully
explained, the speaker showing how
the millions of unemployed men under
Cleveland's administration have found
profitable work under Republican rule.
Local coloring was given this point
when McKinlay .cited instances with
in the personal knowledge of his
hearers. McKinlay spoke of his own
experience as a workman and prom
ised, if elected to Congress, to make
his first duty the conservation of poli
cies that will work to the best advan
tage of the wage Earners. He eulo
gized President Roosevelt as an earn
est, consistent friend of labor and
quoted figures to show that in this re
spect he is fully in touch with the
party during its entire history..
Two hundred men gathered about
the speaker during his remarks, while
as many more reached the spot in time
to hear a portion of his remarks. At
the close he greeted many of the men
whom he knew. He received many as
surances of support, not only from old
acquaintances, but from those whom
he met for the first time.

mittee made a mistake in the date of

Hon. Frank P. Flint of Los Angeles,

SUPREME COURT.
Louis Ferrari will receive no aid from
the Supreme Court in his fight to com
pel the Election Commission to place
his name on the official ballot as a
candidate for Justice of the Peace. He
may commence an action in some tri
bunal of inferior jurisdiction, but the
contest will probably not be ended un
til long after the approaching election.
The Supreme Court in denying Fer
rari's petition says: "Writ denied with
out prejudice upon the ground that
this court cannot entertain as original
proceedings controversies of this char
acter of purely local interest and af
fecting only candidates for county or
municipal offices."
Ferrari petitioned the Superior Court
yesterday afternoon for a writ of man

Peace on the official ballot.
MASON* THOMAS DECLINES.
Mason Thomas declined the Demo
cratic nomination for State Senator.
The following letter explains his posi
tion:
SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 13.
To H. Petsch. Chairman of the Twenty-fifth
Senatorial District Democratic Convention â
Dear Sir: I hereby tender my resignation as
the nominee of the Twenty-flfth Senatorial
District Democratic Convention for the office
of State Senator from said district.
In so doins I desire to express my sincere
thanks to the gentlemen who composed said
convention and my many loyal friends and
supporters for the honor conferred upon me
and their support of my candidacy.
The present disorganized condition of the
Democratic party, together with the non-sup
port of that faction of the party In this dis
trict known as the county committee or McNab
faction, many of whom are openly supporting
my Republican opponent, convinces me that
success of my candidacy is an impossibility,
and I decline to allow myself and friends to
be sacrificed. Very -pecmil^yours^^^
The letter to the committee is supple
mented by this request to the Regis
trar:
To the Registrar of Voters of the City and
Roosevelt is as an issue of this campaign it
does not approach in Importance, it seems to
me the trust and labor questions as issues
in 'this campaign. Last night in this hall I
d.scussed some aspects of the labor question,
and because of pressure of time I shall not
now pause to deal with it. but I wish to-night
to say with emphasis that the gravest Ques
tion aside from the negro question, confront
ing us as a nation is the trust question; and
I wiFh to add that in my opinion, formed after
much studv the trusts will never be treated
as they should be by the Federal Government
until we have a change of administration.
The only really important move the Re
publican party has made against the trusts
was In the menrer case, and that prosecution
had its orieln in action not of the adminis
tration but of the Governors and Attorney
Generals of several States. The failure to
move earnestly should be considered. I think,
side bv side with the astonishing Increase of
the number and Dower of American trusts
since 1^97. I have ceased to look for ag
gressive action in so far as the trusts are con
cerned until the Democratic party is given the
power to take action.
I am net well enough to-night to speak at
greater length, although I had planned to do
so for I have many things to lay before the
people of this city concerning recent acts and
omii-sions of the Federal Government, but I
cannot close without appealing to men of all
parties to reflect on the baste purposes of our
republic, the lofty Ideals of Us founders and
defenders and the distance we have drifted
from those purposes, those Ideals. I would
be glad to see a campaign revival of .the
patriotism of our land â a rekindling of en
thusiasm for the Declaration of Independence,
a bi-rit of love for the. Federal Constitution.
Ah ladies and gentlemen, if we would pitch
our elections to the note sounded In those great
instruments what a new birth of freedom
would be witnessed by the nations of the
Mr. Livernash concluded with words
of commendation for Parker and Da
vis, and by calling on the audience to
join in the singing of "America."
Charles Edelman. candidate for the
Assembly in the Forty-fourth District,
followed Mr. Livernash and asked the
support of the audience not only for
himself, but for all the Democratic
candidates. Another song by the
quartet was applauded and then, with
three cheers for Parker and Davis,
the meeting adjourned.
Kalin Addresses Foresters.
At a high jinks, held by Magnolia
Court No. 29 of the Order of Foresters,
Julius ,Kahn, candidate for Congress,
delivered an address last night. His
improvised speech caused his audi
ence to burst into cheers. Before the
candidate spoke Frank Kerrigan and
James Gallagher entertained the meet
ing with- stories.
Congressman Edward J. Livernash
and William J. Wynn. candidates for
re-election to the House of Represent
atives from the Fourth and Fifth dis
tricts respectively, were the principal
speakers last evening at a mass meet
ing held in the Alhambra Theater un
der the direction of the Iroquois Club.
The house was well filled and enthus
iasm was not lacking.
John H. Kline, grand sachem of the
Iroquois Club, announced the pur
pose of the meeting and then intro
duced William ill Cannon, a past sa
chem of the club, as chairman of the
evening. Mr. Cannon said that con
sidering the inclemency of the weather
the Iroquois Club and the candidates
lt supported had reason to be proud
that the announcement of its meeting
had called out such a large and rep
resentative audience. He then brief
ly analyzed the issues of the campaign
and concluded by urging all to lend
their aid in placing in the Presiden
tial chair Alton B. Parker. The name
of the Democratic standard bearer
was greeted with cheers.
A song by the Iroquois Club quar
tet, excellently rendered, met with an
encore and this concluded, the chair
man introduced Mr. Wynn. Wynn
met with a cordial reception, for
which he expressed appreciation. In
part Mr. Wynn said:
This demonstration reminds me of two
years ago when I stood befcre you. my shop
mates and friend*, ar.d asked for your support.
When I appeared before you at that time I
told you that if I were elected I would be
honest and faithful and would serve your in
terests. I a*k you to-night if I have kept my
promise. <Several ca'ls of "You bet" encour

If durinz my public life I have made any
mistakes they have cot been intentional, and
one thing I can say is that no man in tbls na
tion can say that I have betrayed the people
that I spranc from.
COMMENDS LJVERXASH.
In conclusion Mr. Wynn paid a trib
ute to his colleague, Edward J. Liver
nash, and said that they had agreed
to fight their battles together to vic
tory or defeat, but if victory were
theirs he could assure the people that
they would serve them as they have in
the past.
Mr. Wynn was followed by "William
T. "White, candidate for Superior
Judge, who Fpoke at some length on
the issues of the campaign. Two
more songs by the quartet were en
joyed and then Judge Frank J. Mu
rasky, candidate for re-election to the
Superior bench, was introduced. Judge
Murasky impressed his audience by
saying that it would embarrass him to
make a political speech while a candi
date for the bench and therefore he
would Pimply say to the audience that
if re-elected he would do as he had
done in the past â give equal Justice
to rich and poor alike â which, he be
lieved, was all that any honest person
could ask of a court. H4s remarks
were warmly applauded.
Charles A. Sweigert was called upon
to make a speech and then Chairman
Cannon called upon Livernash, and he
was greeted with cheers. Mr. Liver
nash delivered the most effective
speech of the evening. "While he was
speaking of the great Question that
confronts the South â the question of
the negro â he stopped suddenly and
called upon the quartet to sing "My
Old Kentucky Home." The audience
caught the sentiment and the speak
er's point was won- This, said Liv
ernash, was to let the people know
that the race from which this song
sprang was a race with a heart and

ligrht of civilization, not through strife
and bitter hope. Mr. Llvernash's
speech in part was as follows:
I would indeed be made of callous stuff
were I not deeply affected by the kind things
that have been said of me here to-night by
the speakers that have preceded me. I am
especially touched by the commendation of my
friend Wynn, and here I want to speak of
him. I want to testify before you all that I
know that In public life he has kept the faith.
I had abundant opportunity to watch his ca
reer and I can ?av that he has done his duty
without fear or favor.
REFERS TO XIGHT BEFORE.
I was much amused In this hall last night
fry a prodigiously impassioned and deafening
attack upon me by a gentleman I have not the
felicity of knowing, but who happens to be a
candidate for a seat upon the Superior bench
of this city and county. The worthy Don
Quixote de la Mancha surely was not more de
lightfully valiant in his famous charge upon
the windmill than was my well-intending critic
in his turious onslaught upon me for what he
conceived to be my views of President Roose
velt.
He looked my estimate of Mr. Roosevelt up
and down and across and over and, clearly
ptrceivin- that I was terribly wrong in that
estimate, and feeling himself so much the bet
ter informed concerning our President, he bore
down upon me In a fashion very comforting,
though doubtless very wearying to, him and
affording to me a very grateful sense of gay
ety in a campaign too much affected with
gravity.
But. now that the gentleman has eased his
immortal, soul, may I emerge cautiously from
the wreck of worlds and observe that I never
fcr an instant entertained the sort of views
lie was generous enough to attribute to me in
tones which must have reached Sausalito and
the Farallones? The gentleman's point of view
was somev.hat unfortunate, though his heart
was all right.
Certainly the Democratic party and its can
didates are not. as the gentleman last night
believed, denying the value of Just wars, the
glory of our great soldiers or the courage and
patriotism of Theodore Roosevelt. One may.
however, without disrespect of the President,
and without forgetting his valor In Cuba,
doubt the wisdom of having in the White
House a citizen thinking just as Mr. Roose
velt appears to think about the relation of
the soldier to civilization.
I am very sure that some of the most
thoughtful statesmen of the Republican party
entertain strong fears lest the impulsiveness
of Mr. Roosevelt, operating with his convic
tions about "the big stick." shall plunge the
nation into needless war. war not prcmctive
of our interest or our Ideals. I am also aware,
of course, that many who really have fears of
that sort arc now, under pressure of partisan
ship â the partisanship Washington bade in
beware â picturing Mr. Roosevelt as a some
what muscular angel of peace. If he werÂ«
the Democratic candidate for the Presidency
instead of the Republican candidate they
might be otherwljp employed; and their pic
tures should not distract us from the real
Roosex-elt.
ROOSEVELT IS FORCEFUL.

out full knowledge of the Intricate and diffi

tion of the Southern States, has plunged head-

himself with it approve or disapprove. I am
but staling a fact within the knowledge of
all who have follows the Crum case In the
Senate when I say that the leading Repub
licans of the country are standing loyally by
the policy of McKlnley and are not support
ing Mr. Roosevelt in his rash desire to oblige
the Southern people to deal with the black
race Just as he has concluded they ought to
deal with it. At Washington the strongest
Republican statesmen are of one mind with
the strongest Democratic statesmen in regard
ing the negro question as something to be
kept free of the gangrene of partisanship, and
to be left, so far as may be, to be settled by
the men and women, black and white, who
best understand it acid are most affected by
it. The black people are not afraid of the
Southern Whites. They know the Southern
whites are their best friends. Together the
Southerner* of our own race and the negroes
when* lot has been cast with them, will work
out this tremendous problem, peacefully and
conservatively as God wills. The interven
tion of Mr. Roosevelt has been productive of
harm. It ought to be discouraged.

A New Bacfc for an Old One â
How It Is Done in San
Francisco.
The back aches at times with a
dull, indescribable reeling, making
you weary and restless; piercing
pains shoot across the region of the
kidneys, and again the loins are so
lame to stoop is agony. No use to
rub or apply a plaster to the back
in this condition. You cannot reach
the cause. Exchange the bad back
for a new and strong one â follow the
example of this San Francisco citi-
zen:
John P. Bryson, cook, of 537 Na-
toma street, says: "I had pain in -the
kidneys for eight months before I
used Doan's Kidney Pills. Some-
times it was worse than others and
sometimes of longer duration, but
as the area affected was right across
the small of the back, over the kid-
neys, I knew those organs were the
cause of the entire trouble. A short
time after I used Doan's Kidney
Pills the aching disappeared, and
what to me is of considerable more
importance is the fact I have had
complete immunity from pain dur-
ing the last six months."

The annual convention of the Cali
fornia Miners' Association, which will
bo held in this city on December 5,
G. 7 and 8, Is the immediate cause of
a large amount of correspondence be
tween Secretary Benjamin and prac
tical miners and others concerned in
the mining industry of California. In
accordance with the decision of the
executive committee of the California
Miners* Association, the proceedings of
the coming convention will be made
Interesting by crowding into the four
days as much practical information
from technical and other sources as
possible.
The mining department of the Uni
versity of California will be called
upon to contribute information con
cerning recent experiments and ob
servations and the leading operators in
the many mining counties of Califor
nia are to be invited to furnish pa
pers dealing with mining in its vari
ous aspects. The responses will prob
ably be favorable in many instances.
This course has proved during several
years to be well adapted to holding
the attention of the delegates to the
annual conventions. No single State
has contributed more in this way to
the enlightenment of the public than
has California through the agency of
the California Miners' Association. In
addition to the routine proceedings the
mining delegates will be entertained by
excursions to various places about the
bay.
The report of a committee of the
Fan Francisco Stock Exchange rela
tive to the gold mines and prospects
at Tonopah and Goldfleld, in Nevada,
has been followed by the expected ac

sold before in the San Francisco board
have been duly listed. One result that
may not have been fully foreseen is
th*> loss to the Tonopah stock board of
seme of its members. It is claimed
by brokers in the San Francisco board
that the brokers who have left the
Tonopah board number twenty. Now
that the stocks are before the San
Francisco board there are two agen
cies in this city that are concerned
in selling them to the public.
NEWS OF THE .MINES.
The Ironclad mine in Nevada Coun
ty recently met with an accident to its
pump? when the water had been low
ered to within twenty-five feet of the
bottom of the mine. It resulted in the

ore reserves are estimated at more
than 4.000.000 tons. The mills pro

cost of operation was $1,064,585, in

provision transferring the Government

which will receive a moderate subsidy

Orient. The opposition of foreign coun
tries to a direct discriminating duty on
cargoes brought to the United States
Ir. foreign bottoms may be avoided by
applying this method of subsidy only to
steamers running on no established
line, and commonly known as tramp
steamers.
WASHINGTON. Oct. 14.â On the
first day of Congress a bill will be in
troduced, embodying the views of the
Merchant Marine Commission, de
signed to build up American shipping.
It is believed that the commission has
practically agreed upon the policies to
be pursued, and that the minority, if
any, will confine itself to unimportant
phases of the subject. The commission
proposes to avoid raising opposition to
a direct subsidy measure by suggesting
that an increase in the tonnage tax
levied on the 'ships of all nations be
made, which will result in an income
of several million dollars annually, to
be devoted to the payment of subsidies.
Another indirect method of increas
ing the amount to be paid for an
American merchant marine will be
suggested in a revision of the ocean
mail subsidy act of 1S&1. An effort will
be made to encourage the establishment
of American lines to foreign port9 and
countries not now reached by Amer
ican ships. A provision will be made
for utilizing vessels thus subsidized as
auxiliary cruisers of the navy in time
of war.
Special Dispatch to The Call
Failures this week were 206 in the
United States against 208 last year and
in Canada 24, compared with 26 a year
ago.
Railway earnings in the first week
in September were 6.08 per cent lower
than in 1903. Raw wool is in good de
mand at fall prices. Recent large pur
chases of hides established prices in. a
firm position^ but are followed by less
activity.
Dun's Weekly "Review of Trade will
say to-morrow: "Progress is slow but
sure in the leading branches of manu
facture, contracts being more readily
placed for distant delivery, while the
percentage of idle machinery steadily
decreases. Satisfactory news from lead
ing iron and steel centers tends to
strengthen confidence elsewhere, as the
consumption of iron has been found a
good barometer of business conditions.
Jobbing and wholesale trade in fall and
winter wearing apparel expands grad
ually and such spring lines as are
opened meet with a fairly satisfactory
reception considering the recent Indis
position to provide for future require
ments. At many points the return of
warm weather checked the revival of
retail trade in heavy business, but as
that movement had begun much earlier
than usual the net result thus far is
better than last year."
Building operations have expanded at
some cities, being a noteworthy record
for the month of September and the
permits recently issued promise well
for the future. Labor is fairly well
employed according to the latest offi
cial trades union reports, although the
Fall River strike has lasted longer than
expected.
Our foreign trade returns are irregu
lar in that while showing record cotton
shipments for the season our wheat ex
port trade has practically disappeared,
our export flour trade has shrunk
greatly and corn shipments are likewise
very small. Provisions exports show a
shrinkage, but cattle, oil, copper. Iron
and eteel and general manufactured
exports show gains. Exports of leading
agricultural products, despite the rec
ord shipments of cotton, are the small
est for nine months reported since 1897.
The reports from leading industrial
centers are fully as good as recently
made. Lumber is active at the West,
but quiet at the East. Copper is rather
easier on reported withdrawal of ex
port demand.
Wheat, including flour, exports for
the week ending October 13 aggregate
1,337,175 bushels. Corn exports for the

NEW YORK, Oct. 14.â Bradstreefs
to-morrow will say: Despite irregu
larities, due to warm weather condi
tions of reductions in crop movements,
trade as a whole maintains a satisfac
tory volume. Nothing of a boom char
acter is to be noted, but many lines
show gains over the corresponding pe
riod of 1903, confirmation of this being
found in the record of September rail
road earnings. Clearings are greater
than last October's weekly totals. The
underlying confidence is perhaps best
shown by the increased ease in collec
tions, reports as to which are better
than for nearly twenty years past. The
improvement in the corn and wheat
crops, favored by exceptionally warm
weather for this season of the year, has
produced freer buying from operators
in the Central West and Northwest.
Business is also better on the Pacific
Coast.
This same warm weather, however, is
a drawback to retail business, which
needs the stimulus of sharp, cold
weather. In the Northwest rather less
activity is noted because of this, and at
the South there is a general report that
the warm, dry weather, which is fa
vorable to picking cotton, is holding
the demand back considerably. Eastern
trade also reflects unseasonable weath
er in its effect upon current demand for
fall and winter wear goods, but there
is in addition a backwardness in de
mand for dry goods. Hides and wool
are strong.
BODIE, Oct. 14.â An exceedingly
rich strike is reported from Masonic
Mountain, sixteen miles northwest of
Bodie and in Mono County. A well
defined !edge four feet in width has

assays $700 a ton and the rest of the
ledge assays at $100 a ton. Rich ore
Is being taken out at the surface anJ
sacked for shipment. The discovery
was made on Jump- Up- Joe claim,
owned by three Colorado prospectors â
Bryan, Dorsey and Phillips.
The strike has caused gTpat excite
ment here and people are stampeding
for the new diggings. The district has
been thoroughly organized and ia con
nected with Itodle by wagon road.
Claims are being staked out and the
country is being located fo miles. A
rich float has been found on Masonic
Mountain for years and the mountain
has been the scene of much prospect
ing. The strike is about three-quar
ters, of a mile north of the mountain.
The high altitude and severe climate
will not allow very active work until

Idaho, Oregon, Washington, New Mex

Rome surprise may be experienced
when South Carolina is enrolled in this
list, but the fact Is that South Caro
lina in 1903 had a gold output of half
the size of that credited severally to
Washington and New Mexico, its show
ing In total being $100,700.
One mining company in Smith Da
kota, the Homestake, produced last
year 1,300,000 tons of ore, the value of
which was $4,80a,558 40. It will be borne
in mind that the entire output of the
State of South Dakota was $6,000,000 in
round figures. One great mining, com
bination, therefore, gives So-uth Da
kota its position near the head of the
line.
Comparing the gold output-' of the
various countries of the world for 1903,
Australia is first with $89,000,000 to its
credit; the United States second with
$73,000,000 and Africa third with $67,
000,000. Canada and Mexico produced,
respectively, $18,000,000 and $10,000,000.
Russia leads Europe with $24,000,000 and
Colombia the Spanish American States
with $2,000,000. Among the Asiatic
countries Japan made the lowest rec

the terrific power of the Yuba River when the
winter freshets come, concluded to double the

required. When completed, the Yuba River
will liave a wall more than twenty feet high
with a base of 150 feet across its entire chan

the new cutoff. The broad expanse of river
bottom back of the wall will form a large
settling basin for future deposits of sand and
gravel. This wall will be below the barrier
being constructed by the Government and will
be about two miles in length.

Cook yesterday heard the appeal case of Me

Judge sustained the appeal on the ground
that the ordinance under which the arrest was
made conflicted with the State law making It
a misdemeanor to keep and maintain a place
where opium Is sold and smoked. The ordi
nance was therefore void and arreets should
be made under the State law.

The executive committee of the Civic
Council met last evening and decided
that there would be no action taken In
the matter of increasing the license for
retail liquor dealers from $21 per quar
ter to $125 until next year.
Tho committee was represented by C.
'A. Murdock, J. W. Hatch, P. F. Morris,
L. C. Ostryce and J. E. White. Mr.
IVThite said that he believed that it
would be better to carry the fight over
until the next municipal campaign, at
which time it would be likely that an
effort would be made for a quarterly
license of $500 instead of the $125 that
Is now advocated. The campaign is too
close at hand tn permit of the council
attempting to obtain assistance
through the courts.

RENO,, Nev., Oct. 14.â When the Vir
ginia and Truckee passenger train was
entering Reno last night it ran into a
live electric wire that had dropped
across the track, and for a short time
the passengers were thrown into a
panic, because they thought the train
was on fire.
When the train first struck the wire
a short circuit was caused, and the
lines along the road, the rails and the
wheels literally blazed. This electrical
display lasted for some time, but as
soon as the wire was cut by the wheels
the electricity ceased to spring from
the metal parts of the train. It was
some little time before the passengers
would believe that the train was not on
fire. As a result of the collision Reno
was in darkness for some time.

In an interview Mr. Phelan, presi
dent of the Association for the Im
provement and Adornment of San
Francisco, said that he had visited
many of the leading banks and that
they approved of the idea of acquiring
land for these specific purposes, which
they believed would not involve any
waste of public funds, and at the same
time establish the confidence of our cit
izens in the credit of the community.
! They also believe that their customers
will take many of these bonds, and per
haps when offered for sale by the city
others may bid even more than par.
"Our object is not to buy the bonds, so
much as to insure the improvements,"
said Phelan. "The people interested in
I the Mission Park. I am assured, will
! see that the bonds for that purpose are
taken. They involve $292,000. The Ger
man Savings Bank will take $200,000 of
the bonds. The Mutual Savings Bank
decided at its meeting yesterday to bid
at par for the whole issue of the bonds
for the acquisition of the strip of land
between the park and the Presidio,
thus connecting and making one the
1500 acres of Government land and the
1000 acres of city land included in Gold
en Gate Park, amounting to $325,000.
The Board of Examiners, presumably
for the investment of public school
funds, has already bid for $250,000 of
the children's playgrounds bonds.
"From this you will see that over
$1,000,000 is actually in hand, and the
other $1,000,0000 will be taken by the
other savings and commercial banks
which were interviewed yesterday.
"The bankers of the city express
themselves as being ready to help all

not encourage Jobbery in the expendi
ture of public funds. That was the key

In the precincts investigated we found that

generally of a class of men to whom the aver

From the comparison of the rosters with

XEW YORK, Oct. 14.â Another con
sultation of surgeons has been held
over Mrs. Arthur Paget, the society
leader, who was injured in an elevator
accident, says a Herald dispatch from
London. After lying strapped to a
board two months and a half it has
been found that the upper fracture of
Mrs. Paget's thigh has made no pro
gress and has not yet begun to unite
by sending out bone tissue.
It is now believed to be a question of
a more serious operation. At any event,
a considerable time will be required for
nature to do the healing. The sufferer
will be still lying on her back at Christ

Commissioner Dabney added that the
investigation here had included the
taking of statements of various resi
dents along the rivers, who were able
to make practical suggestions, and in
this manner the commission gleaned
much valuable Information not incor
porated in former reports. As yet the
commission, he said, is not prepared to
give any estimate as to the cost of
inaugurating the river improvements
to be proposed.
The commission of engineers that has
spent the last two months in California
gathering data for a report on the best
methods for draining the Sacramento
and San Joaquin rivers and reclaim
ing their overflowed lands has con
cluded its labors here and its mem
bers will depart for the East to-day.
The commissioners have arranged to
meet again on November 20 In Sioux
City, Iowa, where they will prepare
their report, which they expect to sub
mit to the California Commissioner of
Public Works about the middle of De
cember. Major "T. G. Dabney of Mis
sissippi, chairman of the commission,
in discussing the work done by him
self and associates here, said last
evening:
" The problem we had had under Investiga
tion, is beset with various complications and
presents many phases, each of which demands
particular study. While we have made dili
gent effort to master the subject by a study
of the voluminous written and printed data
that have accumulated, and by examination
of the physical feature* of the ground as far
as practicable, yet the time at our disposal
has been too short to permit us to acquire as
full and thorough Information as desirable.
We are, however, enabled now to "formulate a
general plan for the accomplishment of the
objects In view and also to go Into consid
erable detail in recommending the methods to
be pursued In the practical application of. the
plans to be reported on by the commission.
Previous plans for draining the Sacramento
River, which Is the most serious problem be
fore the commission, have generally recom
mended provisions for carrying off the sur
plus water to the bay In by-pass canals. We
have departed from this plan and expect ulti
mately to make the channels of the river
carry all its water. The San Joaquin River
and its tributaries present a lens difficult
problem and consequently the treatment will
be less elaborate, although there* will be need
for considerable rectification of the banks. We
have made our study of the situation as care
fully as possible and hope to recommend to
California a relief that will be permanent
and most beneficial.

And, by the way, it's not uninterest

But, by the way, the "Last Rose of

brilliant and therefore the best appre
ciated number.
In a garb of Cleopatran type, reveal

Madame Francisca presented the fol
lowing numbersâ which unhappily I
missed: aâ Aria, "Le Cid" (Mas

ailes" (Hain); c â "Manon Lescaut"
(Auber). But from the running com
ment of my neighbors. "Manon Les

Then came the aria from "Traviata,"
"which was warmly â and justly â ap
plauded. And before Koinj? further, let
xne mention that Eugrene Marcellino
was at the piano. (Your pardon, sir,
for this tardiness. You deserved bet

CHATHAM. Mass., Oct. 14.â Driven
down the coast by a northeast storm
the Nova Scotia schooner Wentworth
was thrown upon Chatham Bar last
night and to-day was smashed to pieces
In the terrific surf. It is believed that
not a soul on board survived. The
bodies of a man and a woman were re
covered to-day. It Is 'believed that the
ill-fated vessel carried a crew of at
least eight men besides her skipper,
Captain Priddle.
When the schooner was discovered
c-n the outer bar, life savers were on
the beach opposite the wreck in a short
time and began their efforts to save
those on the doomed vessel, but there
came no sign of life, although lights
were shining In the cabin. They re
mained on the scene all night. At day
break to-day It was seen that two of
the schooner's masts had gone by the
board and that her stern was washed
away. Subsequently the two bodies
were recovered.
The Wentworth was bound from
Hillsboro, N. B., to Newark, N. J.. with
a cargo of plaster rock. On board, so
far as known, were the captain, Esau
Priddle, of St. John, N. B., his wife and
three children and a crew of seven
men.
.King George was born, in 1832, and
was therefore^ 70 years, of age when he
succeeded .his. brother, Albert, two
years ago. He s was married in 1S59 to
Infanta Maijfia Anna, and six children
have been born to the couple. Prince
Friedrich August will succeed to the
throne.
King George had been on the throne
but two years and was so feeble during
all of that period that he was hardly
able to perform the duties of state.
Just before â¢ His death his oldest son,
the Crown Prince, had been appointed
to perform those governmental func
tions which his parent;, was too feeble
ot attend to, ( ' ,' . .

ST. LOUIS. Oct. 14.â Preliminary reports on the awards made to-day
by the various Worjd's Fair departments indicate that California will carry
off from ten to twelve grand prizes, from 130 to 130 gold medals and about
seventy-five silver medals. The work of the superior Jury is not finished,
so few awards can be announced as final. But those made by the depart
ment Jurors became known to-day. Of the grand prizes, the collective ex
hibit made by the California counties in the Palace of Agriculture is to get
one. The golden wine temple has been listed for one on the grounds that It
is the most classic and artistic exhibit in this building. Three California
wine firms get a grand prize e,ach. The University of California gets thre*
and the California educational exhibit one. Dried and canned fruits have
been granted one grand prize" and the forestry exhibit has been similarly
honored. Vegetables take a grand prize also.
The gold medals are distributed mostly among the county exhibits. Ala
meda is said to have carried off the largest number of these medals, with
Sacramento next. Wine, fruit and olive oil all fared well. Nearly a scorÂ«
of wine makers are awarded gold medals. Not one gold medal was award
ed for olives. The Jury was composed of foreigners and they say that the
California olive, while very fine, has never been perfected. They are also
prejudiced against the ripe olive, which seems to be In great favor io the
East notwithstanding. Olive oil takes about a half dozen gold and silver
medals. Honey gets two gold medals; vegetables, four or five; hops, three:
prunes, three: dried fruits, seven: canned fruits, four. The mining exhibit
has carried off a gold medal for the general Installation and about ten for
Individual exhibits.
The best California received for grains was a silver medal and that 1j
the highest award received here for her butter. Many more prizes are ex
pected from the horticultural department, but these awards cannot be made
until the closing day of the fair. Fresno raisins and the Roeding figs took
gold medals. Some appeals will be made by Californlans, who think their
goods did not receive high enough, awards, but it is generally conceded that
the State has don.e splendidly In the way of premiums.
SAYS HIGH ALTITUDES CAUSE
THE DEATH OF CONSUMPTIVES
Dr. Paul M. Cairington Addresses the
Congress of Military Surgeons
at St. Louis.
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 14. â The Interna
tional Congress of Military Surgeons
to-day decided that no badges nor
decorations shall be worn at future
meetings of the organization except
those authorized by law.
Papers were read by Surgeon Paul
M. Carrington, Ph. and M. H. S.. and
Colonel Nicholas Senn, surgeon gen
eral of the Illinois National Guard.
Addresses were made by General Wal
ter Wyman. Ph. and M. H. S.; Dr. Sal
vador Cordova, Honduras, and Dr.
David Macto, Peru. In the course of
his paper Surgeon Carrington said:
"The sending of consumptive pa
tients indiscriminately to high altitudes
has caused the death of. many perons
who under Judicious treatment would
have recovered."
Surgeon Carrington is in charge of
the Government sanitarium at Fort
Stanton, N. M., and he has made a
careful study of consumptive cases.
He attributed the great fatality in
high altitudes to the fact that patients
with lung diseases did not get oxygen
enough to purify the blood.

The case of W. F. Grove, who was
yesterday finally expelled from the
ministry by a unanimous verdict of
the conference, was finally closed to
day by Bishop Morrison, who said:
"There is but one law on the sub
ject of divorce, and that was laid
down by the Son of God himself and
I have no ruling to make on it."
The proposition to change the meet

sented to the annual conference this
morning by the Rev. C. F. Reid and
met the hearty approval of the dele

authorized to complete the proposed

Judge W. W. Morrow .of the United
States Circuit Court, the Pacific Coast
representative of the Carnegie Insti
tution, also spoke, describing the scope
and workings of the institution. He
gave a short account of its origin, re
ferred to the 510,000,000 endowment
given by Carnegie and told of the many
and varied suggestlona received re
garding lines of research which corre
spondents proposed for investigation.
Flying machines, dyspepsia cures, can
cer cures, consumption cures and snake
bite cures were among the things de
sired by voluntary contributors of sug
gestions. Some of these ideas are fa
vored and will be made subjects of re
search. Judge Morrow said in part: .
The institution will not oppose any school
or university, hut we are -to assist these edu^
rational men engaged in exceptional employ
ment and help them perform their experiments.
Not enough has been done here for productive
scholarship. Germany . alone .has done much,
but we are behind, and the Carnegie In
stitution will seek to remedy this. There Is
promise of . much development and beneflclal
results for humanity. Science la now only
a search for beneflclal truths. In this great
effort we ftope the Carnegie . Institution will
be successful and beneficial.
For full three minutes this morning
the students of the University of Cali
fornia cheered President David Starr
Jordan of Stanford at the university
meeting In Harmon gymnasium. The
ovation began when President Jordan
rose to deliver an address on "College
Athletics." President Jordan was in
troduced by President Wheeler as the
"permanent full back of the Stanford
freshman team No- 2."
President Jordan remarked in reply
that he was also "first base on the fac
ulty baseball team at Stanford." He
then spoke of intercollegiate sport, in
part as follows:
Do good and work for your college the best
you can. Never disgrace your college. When
ever you go to a San Francisco saloon always
pive the Stanford yell If you want to cast
disc-race on ua.
Again I say, do Â¦ nothing that will dis
grace the college; don't do what In Harvard
is called "muckerism." I have gone home
when. I had to be ashamed of college athletics.
It l.Â« not a good thing to celebrate a victory
by nlling up with alcohol. A right college
man not go Into a saloon to celebrate.
Such a man has no place among men or
among- college gentlemen. I will send from
Stanford any man who celebrates this way.
We also have men who come to college for
what is in - athletics. They come for induce
ments. They have done much to mar athletic
eports. and they ehould absolutely not be tol
erated. These men often get paid. They dis
grace the university. They should not be al
lowed to stay In college on a different status
from other people. We had better stop ath
letics in general if we have to tolerate such
things.

ALAMEDA, Oct. 14.â That the Oak
land Traction Consolidated means to
improve its local electric road and ser
vice * is J evidenced by a letter from
Secretary Samuel J. Taylor of the cor
poration to the West End Improvement
Association^ According to the com
jnjunication the work of reconstructing
the Alameda system will.' be started
earlyy inHhe comingr year. Folio-wing
a^e extracts' from. Mr. Taylor's letter:
The movement of silver dollars from
the treasury was a little over 541,000,000
and' the shipments for the current year
show an increase over last. Silver dol
lars to the amount of' 546,093,314 were
presented during the year at the treas
ury offices for exchange in other money.
An addition of 52,801,644 was made to
the subsidiary silver coin in circulation,
carrying the total up to -595,528,343.
Gold, of which 531,990,261 was In Jap
anese yen, 510,900,579 in other foreign
coins and 59,005,902 in ore, making al
together 551,796.743, was deposited in
the last fiscal year In San Francisco
for telegraphic exchange.
Since July 1, .1900. there has been a
growth of 5463,991.862 in the money In
circulation, or an annual average of
nearly $116,000,000. On October 1 the cir
culation reached . the maximum of
431.16 for each person.
In the current fiscal year the demand
for small bills, in spite of all previous
additions, has been unceasing. Ex
perience has made it clear that the
stock of small notes Is hardly suffi
cient. The department has employed
all its resources, but these are limited,
for the issue of silver certificates can
not exceed the silver dollars available
and the United States notes have a
volume fixed by law. The report says:
"This condition of things might be
remedied by Congress without inflating
the currency. First, the issue of gold
certificates of the denominations of $5
and 510 might be authorized. Secondly,
such certificates to the amount of 550.
000.000 might be substituted at once for
United States notes by the application
of that sum from the reserve. Thirdly,
the national banks might be permitted
to issue any part of their circulation in
55 notes by the repeal of the provision
allowing only one-third of the total is
sue of each institution in that denom
ination." -V-.'-
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14.â Ellis H.

.The net ordinary revenues are shown

on account of the. Panama canal and
54,600.000 loaned to -the Louisiana Pur
chase Exposition Company, which -lat
ter has now been nearly all repaid. But
for these, the recorded deficiency of
541, 770,751 would have been changed to
a surplus of 512,829,428.
The operations affecting the public
debt exceeded tho3e of the preceding
year and amounting to 5699,660,941 in
receipts and 5638,924,579 In disburse

The redemption of United States notes
in gold amounted to 511.0S1.068 for the

5474,128.
In consequence of the deficiency In
the revenues the cash in the offices of

ing the year from 5170,020,562 to 5137,-
G20.204, and by October 1 to 5125,964.-

The aggregate supply on October 1. ex
clusive of certificates, was estimated
at 52,83K.333,'i24, of which 52.662.149,489
was in circulation. The proportion of

of plans for a consolidated city and
county of Oakland were taken to-day,

Legislature providing for the division
of a county where a majority of the
voters favor such a course. The pro

SHERIFF IS ORDERED TO
LEVY ON SITRO'S PROPERTY
Judge Hebbard Issues Mandate to En*
force the Payment of Long
Overdue Alimony.
Judge Hebbard yesterday ordered the
Sheriff to levy on the property of Ed
gar B. Sutro In this city for the collec
tion of $550 said to be due his wife as
unpaid alimony under the order of tha
court made on March 6, 1903, and ter
minated October 16 of the same year.
A tew days ago Sutro sued his wife,
Henrietta, for divorce in Multnomah
County. Oregon. He lives in Portland.
In July, 1902. Mrs. Sutro was the plain
tiff in a suit charging her husband with
infidelity, a Mrs. Merrill being named
as co-respondent. She was given $150
alimony pending the litigation, but
failed to get the divorce, as the action
was barred on account of the delay in
beginning it. Sutro filed a cross-coin*
plaint, charging desertion, but it was
thrown out of court because he was not
a resident of this State.
Divorces were granted yesterday by
Judge Troutt to Fannie H. Backerly
from James T. Beckerly for desertion
and neglect, and to Elizabeth II. Folaa
from Lee E. Foise for cruelty.
Suits for divorce were filed by Au
gusta C. Epeneter against Charles F.
Epenefcer, intemperance and cruelty;
Marie Savage against George F. Sav
age, desertion; Clara L. "Wilmarth
against Charles T. "Wilmarth, deser
tion; Sylvia A. Martin against Louli

way against Mary Holloway. desertion.
FIRE COMMISSIONER
AFTER SCPER VISORS
The finance committee of the Board
of Supervisors came in for another
scoring by Commissioner Parry yes
terday afternoon. The cause of Par
ry's outburst was a suggestion from
the Supervisors that certain bills for
beds supplied to the firehouses and
for extra fire badges would be allowed
this time, providing the Fire Commis
sioners should promise to obey the
law in the future. Parry said that the
Fire Commissioners were not respon
sible to the "bunch of old hens" as he
called them.
Some time ago the Fire Commis
sioners awarded contracts for sup
plies, the cost of which exceeded in the
aggregate $250. the limit set by the
charter for such expenditure*.
The matter was referred to the City
Attorney for an oplnon as to the Su
pervisors* right to interfere with thÂ«
contract supply bills of the Fire Board.
The charter provides for 225 fire
badges. This number excluded those
allowed to underwriters and outside
companies. The Commissioners decid
ed'to call in these extra badges and"
issue 100 more so that all fire badges
should be alike. The bills for the ex
tra hundred "have been held 'up by the
Supervisors.
The question of interfering with the
new underground fire alarm system by
attaching the auxiliary boxes is in the
hands of Chief Hewitt and will be up
for consideration at the meeting of th*
Board of Electricity.
CONSIDER LICENSE
TAX ON DANCE ILVLIiS
Proprietors of several local halla
appeared before the Supervisors' Joint
Committee on Judiciary and Licens*
yesterday to protest against the exist
ing ordinance imposing a license of
$75 per quarter. Supervisor Hocks
argued against the license, saying it
would affect fraternal and beneficial
organizations. Supervisor Rea thought
the license Just, in view of the fact
that liquors are sold to minors, whose
morals are endangered.
Supervisor Lunstedt said he had
consulted with Chief of Police TVttt
man and It was agreed that the or
dinance ought to be bo modified as to
exempt fraternal halls and apply only
to dance halls with saloons attached,
such as exist on the B.-u-bary Coast.
The dance hall owners, represented
by Archie Campbell, protested that
the ordinance was in conflict with thÂ»
charter, which prohibits_ the exaction
of a second license. They already p*ar
a liquor license.
The committee directed the cleric.
In conjunction with the Chief of Po
lice, to prepare an ordinance impos
ing a license on saloon dance halls
only, but excepting fraternal dance
halls from its provisions. . '.*

Judge Coffey yesterday declined to
grant the petition of Mrs. Anais Hale
for $6700 extra compensation as ad
ministratrix of the estate of Joseph P.
Hale. Mrs. Hale paid out of her own
pocket a judgment for $5000 against
the . estate for damages for Injuries
sustained by a woman who fell down
the elevator shaft of the Supreme
Court building. The court held this
payment a personal matter. Hereto
fore it was shown that Mrs. Hale and
Mrs. Josephine Boyle, Hale's daugh
ter, bought up claims against the es
tate under their face value. This was
contrary to law and the court would
not allow the claims. Judge Coffey
allowed A. E>. Keyes a fee of $10,000
for services as attorney to the estate.

Attorneys E. S. Pillsbury and W. F.
Williamson, representing the execu
tors of Bertha M. Dolbeer's will, yes
terday filed notice of their application
for an order for the taking of six
more depositions In New York City for
use in the coming trial. The persons
whose testimony is desired are Wil
liam B. Leonard, Jennie H. Leonard.
Mrs. Ethel Postley, Julius. A. Shaw,
J. Stanley Foster and Elsie A. Me-
Clurg.
At Mr. Plllsbury's request on Fri
day Judge Coffey shortened the time
for notice of the application to one
day, and it will be heard this morn
ing. The Judge said he wished to
expedite matters because he would
have 200 citizens on hand on Novem
ber 2 for examination as jurors. He
thinks it will be difficult to secure a
Jury on account of the publicity given
to the contest.

Movements of Steamers.
THE PfTCH SHIP EUROPA FROM ANTWERP AND THE AMERICAN BARK ARCHER FROM HONOLULU ENTERING THE
HARBOR I'NDER Fl"LL SAIL. WITH A FAIR WIND BLOWING DEAD IN THROUGH THE GOLDEN GATE THE VES
SELS DISPENSED WITH THE USE OF TOWBOATS.
The big DatÂ« h s-hip T^uropa, 1C6 days
from Antwerp, sailed into port yester
day morning. With th<? fair wind blow
ing dead into the Golden Gate, Captain
Bona did not rind it necessary to take
?. t'.ig. Captain Lancaster of the bark
Archer, from Honolulu. evidently
thought so. too. as he kept sail on and
â¢slipped into the harbor before the
breeze. The two vessels made a pretty
scene as they came up the bay, for
r.othirg on the sea or of the sea can
rival the picture of a ship under full
sail.
The Eumpa received the usual dona
tions of Etorma and fair weather dur
ing her voyage, the last occasionally
and the first in allopathic doses, es
pecially around the Horn. Coming up
the Pacific she experienced strong
westerly gales. The vessel called in at
VaJparais-o for fresh water, and to put
ashore the carpenter, who was afflicted
with consumption an<l not able to pro
ceed further on the \oyage.
The Archer was 22 tlays coming from
Honolulu, and brought up 1*2,089 bags
of sugar. In latitude 37.43 north and
lonpitude 131.10 west an unknown bark
was sighted steering east, evidently
try in? to make this port. She had lost
her main topgallantmast and had the
other appearances of having: received
rough usase. The position would put
her T2 minutes north of San Francisco
and S degrees 40 minutes west, or some
thing over o'.'O miles away. Among .the
t twenty-seven barks Â» hich are headed
for this port, and whose present exact
localities are unknown, though several
Fhtuild he within 50ft miles of San Fran
r-isc-o, it cannot be said just what bark
is steering this way with her main top
gallantmast gone.
Ifctrkcmlne Addenda Ashore.
The barktntine Addenda, belonging to this
pert, is r^ijorted to be ashore at Pallister Bay.
about thirty-five miles routheast of Welling
ton, New Zealand. She was bound from Lyt
tleton to Newcastle. Australia, ami stranded
In fogey weather. No details have betn re
ceived at the Merchant?" Exchange and it Is
not known whether any of her people are lost
or not.
The Addenda, owned by the Simpson Lum

The entire document constitutes an
excellent voluntary advertisement of
Californlan methods and gives an ade
quate idea of results. Texas farmers
are urged by their committee to take
a lesson from Calfornia and to adopt
irrigation as a powerful auxiliary to
successful agriculture and horticul
ture.
The Texas committee reported In
detail concerning the treatment for
insect pests, the canning and evapo
rating of fruit, the irrigation systems
of this State and the sale and distri
bution of California's fruits and vege
tables. Throughout the long report
there is praise for the farmers of this
State.
A report has been submitted by a
committee of the Texas Fruit and
Truck Growers' Association of Texas
that recently made a visit to Califor
nia to investigate the agricultural
methods of this State. An advance
copy of this report has been received.
It says In Dart:
In cultivation. Callfornlans excel, and It is
worth a trip to that distant land to any grower
who delights in beholding orchards, fields and
Sird.-n* In the most perfect state of cultiva
tion. No weeds, no waste spots, no neglected
comers appear, but everywhere good tillage
Is manifested and all the rapabilitlas of the
soil -Â»re employed to produce the crop. We
were Impressed. In beholding these cultivated
flejds. that we should reduce our acreage
where necessary and cultivate smaller areas
better and. thereby get much better results.
The Callfornlans leave nothing undone. They
spare no pains to make their products as at
tractive an possible. Their packing is of the
very test and a model for growers everywhere.
Business men from three StatesâCal
ifornia, Washington and Oregon â as
.sembled in this city yesterday as mem
bers of the executive committee of the
Pacific Coast Jobbers' and Manufac
turers' Association to elect officers to
serve during the current year and to
transact other business. The associa
tion includes 200 leading business houses
of the Pacific Coast. It is interested
largely with matters relating to rail
way and water transportation, Its pur
pose being to protect the commercial
welfare of business men in the Pacific
Coast States and to guard the trade
territory against the aggressions of
those outsiders who strive to build up
at the expense of the coast.
This was the first meeting of the
newly elected executive committee since
Its recent selection. In the committee
are included H. D. Loveland of the Pa
cific Traffic Commercial Association,
Charles Holbrook of Holbrook, Merrill
& Stetson of this city, Wakefleld Baker
of Baker & Hamilton, Brace Hayden of
the Dunham, Carrigan & Hayden Com
pany, W. R; Wheeler of Holbrook, Mer
rill & Stetson, Adolph Mack of Mack
& Co., A. C. Rulofson, E. R. Lillenthal
of Lllienthal & Co., H. J. Morton of the
Pacific Hardware and Steel Company,
A. G. Towne of Blake, Moffltt & Towne,
I. F. Littlefleld of W. P. Fuller & Co.,
Edward Everett of the Tubbs Cordage
Company, J. O. Carroll, L. C. Scheller
of the Union Metal Company of Los
Angeles, William Schaw of the Schaw-
Batcher Company of Sacramento, John
C. White of Marysvllle, L. A. Lewis of
Allen & Lewis of Portland, Or., and J.
S. Goldsmith of the Schwabacker Bros.
Company of Seattle.
The annual election of officers did not
occupy much time. H. D. Loveland,
who served the association last year as
president, was unanimously re-elected.
Charles Holbrook was elected vice pres
ident for San Francisco, William
Schaw for Sacramento. John C. White
for Marysville, A. L. Lewis for Port
land and J. S. Goldsmith for Seattle,
the different cities represented in the
association being all given recognition
in the making up of the official board.

The narrow puffs called by the

much used for trimmings during the
summer, trim some of the handsomest
gowns this fall. They are. still. warped
into scroll shapes, knots, etc., and out
line'trimmings and the edges of'drap
eries.
Another popular device for elaborat
ing trimmings is the use of twists
made of the material of the gown â -
net, silk or velvet- These twists are
twined and. knotted into all sorts of
fanciful designs and decorate lace, net
and gauze flounces or border edges of
flounces or draperies. . ;

Heavy cords covered with the mate
rial of the coat or gown are used on
the most elaborate models. On a
striking Directoire robe of copper coN
ored silk and white net the. skirt is
of the net richly embroidered in an
artistic blend of pale blues and pale
pinks. The bodice, with its Directoire
train, is of the silk. Over the hips
there is a pannier (or, some persons
call it, a draped polonaise effect),
made up of heavy cords covered with
the copper colored silk and twisted
and turned into curves that follow the
lines of the figure gracefully. The
drapery of the bodice ends in the same
twining and curving big cords over the
shoulders and tops of the sleeves.
These heavy covered cords are used on
all the materials employed for elabor
ate garments â gauzes, nets, silks, chif
fon velvets and thin wools. They cen
ter puffs, head flounces, outline edges
and answer all the purposes of bring
ing desirable lines of a gown or coat
into prominence.
Narrow folds, as in days long past,
are returned to high favor for trim
mings. They outline and border other
decorations or follow lines of their own
in straight or fanciful designs. On
a. rich black net gown the gathered
flounces of the skirt are festooned with
narrow black velvet folds and the folds
are looped, coiled and knotted among
thefull draperies and trimmings of the
bodice.
U r y* HE GRAFTERS," by Francis Lynde, a political story which
I is steadily growing in favor as one of the most readable stories
of the day. runs through its second installment in the Sunday
Call Magazine to-morrow. This popular novel will be completed
on October 30. On November 6 will appear complete in one in
stallment, "The Second Mrs. Jim," by Stephen Conrad, also one of
the novels coming rapidly into popular favor. In .presenting a
novel selling at the book stalls for $i 50 complete in one install
ment for 5 cents, the Sunday Call is introducing a feature that has
never been presented by a daily paper in the United States, and one
which is employed by but one or two of the leading magazines of
America.

he is at once subjected to the attentions of numerous mammas with
marriageable daughters; Ray Stannard Baker has a rattling good
account of a picturesque and exciting custom of the cattle ranges in
"The Roping at Pasco's," wherein the knights of the riata and chaps
hold gallant tourney, and on the storiette page Ellsworth E. Kellv
lias" "An Old Fashioned Wooing," Campbell McLeod "The Hunge'r

clever and amusing little stories.
There are a number of special articles of importance. Arthur R
Briggs, manager of the State Board of Trade, has "California's Trade
Outlook"; "Selling American Goods in the Orient," written from
the diary of two trained and successful American salesmen, should be
instructive reading for all business men; "A Tooth Talk for Parents
and Children" is a page of sensible advice by Dr. William Merrill
Tryon; Augusta Prescott writes upon the winter styles in furs;
Madge Moore has a page giving some reminders on etiquette for the'
casual caller ; there is a page on "The Harmony of Tints" wherein
women will find good advice on matching colors to hair and eyes;
and in 'addition to the puzzle page, a half dozen smaller articles of
worth.

dish; chop a bunch of parsley very
fine, one small onion very fine and mix
them with salt and pepper; throw
bread crumbs sufficient to cover the

Some inexperienced housewives have
trouble in separating the whites and
yolks of eggs. They need experience
this no longer. A patent separator can
be bought, a thing so simple that it Is
a wonder we none of us thought of It
before. It is simply a cup with a false
bottom, in which there is a narrow slit.
â¢Through this slit the white of the egg
finds its way, leaving the yolk safe in
side. -

Law Suits in Borneo.
Justice in Borneo is administered in
a most primitive manner. One way
of deciding between two disputants is
to give each a large lump of salt.
These lumps are dropped in water, and
he whose lump is first dissolved is de
cided to be in the wrong. Or two
live shellfish are placed on a plate and
lime juice squeezed over them. The
verdict is given according to which
man's fish moves first.
A pink chiffon dance frock has its
graceful skirt trimmed with upstand

upward very often.
Valenciennes allover lace has for the
yoke three moderately heavy lace
medallions of a deeper tone of cream
than the net. One medallion is used
at the front, and the others over the
shoulders, being shaped to suit the fig
ure. The medallions are connected
prettily by bows of narrow cream col
ored velvet ribbon.
outlined with a drapery of the cloth in
hood form. The wrap itself is one of
the shawl-shaped capes with dolman

collarless finish outlined with fancy
braid. The sleeve is worthy of note,
being of the voluminous order popular
in new coats.
The velvet of a regal gown prominent
at one of the openings of Paris models
is white with a soft subtle bloom tinged
with pink. Nine out of ten of the visi
tors who stopped to look at it believed
it to be veiled with a coarse net and
the tenth, it is safe to say, went astray
as to the real character of the material.
The velvet is, as a fact, one of the
many new. plush weaves which are
seen for the first time this fall. The
ground has a slight chameleon effect
obtained by the mingling of tenderly
tinted threads. Over the surface is
thrown a netlike pattern soft to the
touch but deluding to the observer.
The lines of the gown are classical. The
bottom of the plain skirt is bordered
with a pattern borrowed from an old
tapestry and worked in silver thread
and the softest pastel pinks and
greens.
Flounces cut in scallops or points at
the foot are bound; as of old, with a

Earlier in the season there was a ten
dency toward binding flounces with a

this is still seen now and then. A bias
plaid binding is sometimes used on

A RIOT OF ELABORATION IN
THE DRESS MODES OF TO-DAY
THE PHILIPPINE ISSUE.
IX its floundering search for an issue the Democratic party has
grabbed at the Philippines. It is unpleasant to be compelled to
question the sincerity of the loaders of a great party in this
country. But no other course seems possible in dealing with the
sr.pportcrs of Judge Parker. He is supported by Mr. Hearst, who
before the Spanish war was over, before the fall of Santiago, before
our liag was any nearer Manila than Cavite. put at the head of his
papers the cry: "Xail the Hag to the Philippines. Don't only raise
it, nail it. " Parker is supported by Judge Gray of Delaware. He
ir.adc the treaty of Paris as one of our commissioners, by which we
took the Philippines and paid Spain $20,000,000 for them, and as
a Senator voted to ratifv his work.
Parker is supported by Bryan. When Senator Hoar and other
cautious Republican Senators were holding up the treaty, and had
the power to compel its amendment as to the Philippines, Mr. Bryan
went to Washington to support the treaty, to prevent its amend
ment, and induced enough Democratic Senators to vote for its rati
fication to defeat Senator Hoar. Now all of these active parties to
the acquisition of the islands are joining in the roar against the
Republican party about the Philippines. Why did Mr. Hearst want
the flag nailed to the islands? Why did Judge Gray want to pay
$20,000,000 for them? Whv did Mr. Brvan want to confirm the
purchase by ratifying the treaty?
They were all supported by the Democratic press of the -South,
which almost without exception demanded that we hold the islands.
What would these people have? We could not nominally hold the
Philippines, leaving them without government or the means of
maintaining order. We had to do something there. The admin
istration took up the burden laid upon it by the treaty. True, we
have sent soldiers, and there has been carnage in all the archipelago.
But we also instituted law. We sent Judges and organized civil
courts. We sent teachers and organized schools. We have fur
nished a stable coinage and have promoted industry.
Xone of the critics claim that they would have done differently.
The many tribes with which we have to deal had as many different
ideas of government and order. Spanish rule had not been a pre
paration for self-government, since it excluded the natives from any
part in civil government, and even looked coldly upon their ambi
tion to have a place in the priesthood of the ruling church. As far
as possible they were also prevented from acquiring the Spanish lan
guage, because their ignorance of the speech of their masters made
their subjection to arbitrary power easier.
Xo one was very glad when we assumed the burden. Governor
Taft. when appointed by President McKiuley, declared himself op
posed to the acquisition of the islands, but accepted the responsibility
of their government and entered upon it in a faithful spirit. His
successor. Governor Wright, is a Tennessee Democrat, son-in-law of
the famous Semmes, the Confederate admiral who smote our com
merce during the Civil War. He has executive ability of the first
class, and is applying himself with great patience and fidelity to the
hard problem. His fellow Democrats at home would better help
than hinder him. Already he finds that the campaign here made by
Messrs. Hearst, Gray and Bryan is having a bad effect in the islands.
1 he people are being inspired to vault over the preparatory stages
of education, industry and self-restraint, and demand immediate in
dependence, without regard to their state of preparation for self
government. Governor Wright has called the attention of President
Roosevelt to this in a letter that has been made public^
The Brooklyn Eagle is a Democratic paper of the first class. Its
editor, Mr. McKelway, had his training on Dan. Manning's paper in
Albany. He led the movement for Mr. Cleveland's nomination for
a third term, and supports Judge Parker. But he sees clearly the
bad faith and insincerity of the Democratic position on the Philip
pines. Commenting on Governor Wright's letter he says, editorially :
"Assuredly he did no more than his duty when he notified the Presi
dent of the results there of the agitation here. Xor is it for a mo
ment to be presumed that he exaggerates the consequences. Under
Spanish rule the islands knew no peace. Under American rule law
is no longer a travesty on the term, and plunder is not a common
place. Achievements of this sort are no stigma â they add luster
to the stars that decorate the flag. Agitation as to independence,
mar or remote, is distinctly damaging. Stop it."'
So say all Americans who hope for an outcome, however re
mote, of our rule in the Philippines that will be honorable to our
country and useful to the Filipinos.

fer, by comparison, by the same percentage. It
Is true that every teacher would get more
money, but some teachers, eepeclally In the
rich and thickly settled counties, would get
a much greater raise in their salaries, com
puted In dollars, than others, especially those
In the poorer and sparsely settled counties.
Therefore. It Is apparent that if the pro
posed Increase of $2 per census-child be
distributed by the present system the conse
quent raise in teachers' salaries will be un
equal and Inequitable In Its effect. For this
reason. I think an Increase In the State census
child per capita of $2, or any other sum. Is
not the first result to be achieved. For, If
the present method of distribution of State
school money be unjust to the teachers (and
I think that It Is), a better, more equitable
and more just methoJ of distribution should
be, in my Judgment, the first thing to be
worked out. If that be dene I think there
will be no complaint: certainly nowhere near
so much as there Is at present.
What do you and your fellow- teachers
think? Very truly yours,
GEORGE C. PARDEE.
WOODLAND, Oct. 14.â A letter writ
ten by Governor Pardee to Dr. J. C. :
Thompson of Alameda, former presi
dent of the Northern California Teach
ers' Association, in which the distribu
tion of the State school funds to the
various counties was discussed at
length and unfavorably commented
upon by the Governor, was read by Dr.
Thompson at the ninth annual session
of the association, held here last Thurs
day. The letter, which contains much
that is important to the teachers of the
State, is as follows:
SACRAMENTO, October 10, 1904.
Georg* C. Thompson. 2159 Clinton avenue,
Alameda, Cal.â Dear Sir: Since I have found
it Impracticable, on account of other engage
ments, to attend the Teachers" Institute at
Woodland on thÂ« 13th. it has occurred to me
that perhaps it might be or some interest to
the ladles and gentlemen present at your
meeting to liatÂ«n to mme comments on the
matter cf the distribution of State 6chool
money. If so, the following ie entirely at
your disposal:
California, as you know, levied last year a
tax upon all property in the State of a little
over 17 cents per hundred dollars of assessed
valuation in order to comply with the law.
which provides that there shall be raised, for
every school census child, the sum of $7.
We all feel that the present salaries paid
schoolteachers In this State, more especially
in the country district*, are not sufficient to
Induce men and women to take up teaching
as a lifework and make a profession of It.
like mediclrve, law and theology. California
wants, of course, the best teachers she can
get; and In order to Increase the salaries
of our teachers and enable us to get and keep
good ones It has been proposed to raise the
State per capita per census child from $7
to $9.
Before discussing this proposal let us see
something about the present situation. Last
year, according to the report of the. State Su
perintendent of Public Instruction, Hon. T. J.
Kirk, the State alone raised, for the grammar
and primary public schools, the very respect
able sum of $3,556,364 15. There were em
ployed tn the public schools (and by "public
schools" I mean always primary and gram
mar grades) 7797 teachers. Now. if the State
school money had been equally divided
among this number of teachers each of them
would have received a little over $455 (to
be exact $156 12) of the State money.
But as a matter of fact many, very many,
of our teachers did not receive any scuh part,
of the State school money toward the payment
of bis or her salary. The amount they re
ceived varied between the f248 (the lowest,
the Alpine County teachers received) to the
$783 (the highest), received by the San Fran
cieco teachers. This was State money, mind
you; and whatever greater sum the Alpine
teachers were each paid, over and above the
$24S of State money, they got the surplus from
the county â and with this county money we
have, at this time, nothing to do.
Let us take some concrete examples of
what State aid per teacher In the northern
counties of this State, In the school year end-
Ing June 30, 1904, amounted to: Alameda.
$579; Alpine. $248; Amador. $3S8; Butte. $335;
Calaveras, $371; Colusa. $342; Contra Coeta,
$46t$; Del Norte. $354; El Dorado. $268; Fresno.
$402; Glenn. $271; Humboldt. $428; Inyo, $275;
Lake. $311; Lassen. $233; Marln. $475; Marl
posa, $310; Mendocino. $323; Modoe, $3Â«2;
Mono. J357; Monterey, ?3$2; Napa, $416; Ne
vada, $457; Placer. $380; Plumas. $288; Sac
ramento, $371; San Francisco. $783: San
Benlto. $275; San Joaquin. $433; San Mateo.
$453; Santa Clara, $509; Santa Cruz, $443;
Shasta. $338; Sierra, $314; Siaklyou, $360;
Solano, $433; Sonoma, $429; Stanislaus, $319;
Butter, $301; Tehama. $339; Trinity. $306;
Tuolumne, $423; Yolo, |381; Tuba. $413.
These counties, as I have said, are the
northern counties of this State, and the figures
quoted are computed from the figures In State
Superintendent Kirk's report, but the same in
equalities occur in the southern counties.
The figures given establish. I think, the
fact that the State money is not equitably
distributed to the teachers of the State.
It Is proposed to increase the State census
child per capita from $7 to $9, In order to
raise enough State money to pay our teachers
larser salaries.
Let us see what this proponed increase would
do for the teachers In the counties quoted
above. The figures are as follows: Alameda,
from $570 to $700; Alpine, $248 to *300; Ama
dor. $3S8 to $464; Butte. $335 to $422: Cala
vera*. $371 to $413; Colusa. $342 to $412- Con
tra Costa $466 to $566; Del Norte $354 to
$429: El Dorado. $268 to $322; Fresno. $402 to
$495; Glenn, $271 to $328; Humboldt $428 to
$520; Inyo. $275 to $357; Lake. $311 to $376;
Lasaen. $293 to $S55; Marln. $475 to $584;
Mariposa. $310 to $3B5: Mendocino $323 to
S39O: Modoc $362 to $431; Mono $357 to $432;
Monterey. $382 to $462; Napa. $416 to #500;
Nevada. $457 to $548; Placer, $380 to $457;
Plumas, $288 to $345: Sacramento, $371 to

Special Dispatch, to ThÂ« Call.
MARYSVILLE, Oct, 14.â Claud F.
Hankins, the boy murderer, was con
victed of murder in the second degree
and recommended to the mercy of the
court to-day by a jury. The jury was
out eight hours. It is understood that
from the time the jury retired at noon
until shortly before it announced its
readiness to report that eleven of the
twelve men wanted a verdict of mur
der in the flrst degree.
When the jury announced its verdict
Attorney Carlin for the defense created
a scene by accusing the foreman of the
jury of unjurorlike conduct after the
case had been submitted. Only the in
tervention of Judge McDaniel prevent
ed a lively mixup.
The last few hours of the trial were
enlivened by the bickerings of the at
torneys in the case. While making his
closing address to the jury District At
torney Brittan accused Attorneys Car
lin arid Johnson, counsel for the de
fendant, of concocting the story told
by the defendant on the witness stand
yesterday of the brutal action of Ham
kins 1 victim toward the boy before he
was killed by the latter. An exciting
scene followed. Attorney Carlin de
manded the protection of the court
from alleged insult and . branded the
accusation as a lie. When Brittan
asked who made up the defense Carlin
replied, "God Almighty."
The trial has been remarkable for the
efforts of the attorneys on both sides.
On account of the extreme youth of the
boy defendant the District Attorney
was required to make a great show of
evidence to convince the jury of his
guilt, while the crime was so cold
blooded and the admissions made so
incriminating that the defendant's at
torneys were required to put forth ex
tra efforts to justify the deed.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The value of the wine and brandy
â¢which will be made in Fresno for the
special religious occasion is estimated
at $50,000. Three vineyards are under
consideration by the rabbis. In the
making of the liquor not a Christian
hand will touch the grapes or the vats
or the barrels, which, when filled, will
ea< h bear the official seal of the rabbis.
A large army of orthodox Jews, men
who are known never to- work on the
Pabbath day. will be engaged to ac
company Rabbi Grodinsky and Rabbi
Cohn to Fresno and during the wine
making the greatest precaution will be
observed to assure the carrying out of
the work in the strictest orthodox man
ner. The rabbis are expected to leave
this city for Fresno on Monday.
The rabbis are men of devout de
meanor and are specially and deeply
concerned in the orthodoxy of their
Jewish brethren. They have been sent
out to the rich Fresno vineyards by
a company in the East, to which will
be sent the wine and brandy and which

BOSTON, Oct. It.â The ' House of
Deputies of the Episcopal General Con
vention, at the close of a four day3*
debate, to-day rejected an amendment
to the divorce canon. The amendment
sought to prevent the remarriage of
divorced persons by clergymen of the
denomination. While the House of
Bishops may yet act on the matter. It
is certain that no change will be made
by the present convention.
The present law of the church, which
has been In operation since 1859, al
lows the remarriage of the innocent
party to a divorce granted for infidel
ity. At several conventions attempts
have been made to repeal this law.
A vote was 'taken to-day by the
House of Deputies, sitting as a com
mittee of the whole, on the question
of reporting the proposed amendment
The reformers were successful by a
vote of 214 to 191, and this vote was
regarded as representing the actual
strength of the contending forces. The
final vote, however, was taken by dio
ceses and orders, and where a diocese
was evenly divided in sentiment its
strength was counted in the negative.
The vote by dioceses was; Clericalâ
For the amendment, 30; against, 21; di
vided, 10. Lay voteâ For, 25; against.
24; divided. 6.
Practically the entire strength of the
Middle Western States, the stronghold
of the High Church party, declared for
the proposed reform, but the Pacific
States and a number of the Southern
States voted against a change of the
present canon. The diocese of New
York opposed the amendment, while
that of Pennsylvania favored it. Ver
mont, New Hampshire and West
ern Massachusetts voted for a change,
as did the lay delegates from Rhode
Island. The clerical deputies from
Maine favored the amendment, but the
votes of Connecticut and Massachu
setts were cast in the negative.
The issue was not a party one, al
though the whole strength of the High
Church forces was given to the reform
movement. The president of the House
of Deputies, Rev. Dr. W. H. McKim
of Washington, voted for the old
canon, although the clerical vote of
his diocese supported the proposed
change. The convention will hold no
session to-morrow.

At the end of the first year, the
artist says, Barnhart & Swasey re
fused to raise his salary. The mat
ter was compromised. Then Martinez,
the impressionist and pupil of the best
masters at Paris, was forced to Join
the Sign Painters' Union. The ini
tiation fee for the same is $35. More
humiliations came, Martinez alleges
that his salary was reduced and that
he was discharged. The indignant Im
pressionist intends to sue Barnhart &
Swasey for $200 back pay, which he
claims is due him.
After putting his artistic brush to
commercial use and decorating sign
boards with impressionistic paintings,
Xavier Martinez now complains that
Barnhart & Swasey, his employers, re
fuse to carry out the contract entered
into with him. Martinez claims that
the firm hired him for five years with
the understanding that he was to re
ceive a $5 raise In his monthly salary
every year. On these considerations
Martinez decided to sacrifice art for a
monthly wage.

MA"V CLiASH IX THE COURTS
The cardinal eleven will have the ad
vantage of an exceptionally cool and
heady field general and quarter-back.
Fenton, who will give the signals and
run the plays, is of the same stuff that
makes Bansbach so useful to the var
sity, gritty and heady, and he can be
depended upon to keep the team to
gether at all stages of the game.
The Stanford baby team will go on
the field averaging 170 pounds to the
man. There are no stars in the aggre
gation and well rounded team work
will have to be responsible for victory
il that is obtained. Tomasini, Fenton
and Cadwalader are first-class punters
and should excel Berkeley in this de
partment of the game.
The defense of the team is good, and
cross-tackle bucks, with Tomasini and
Horton carrying the ball much of the
time, will be depended upon for quick
gains on the offensive. These two
players should prove a source of mar
velous strength to the freshmen, as
both are playing in varsity form and
stand a good chance for a place on the
big eleven.
Coach C. D. Hauverman, who has
had entire charge of the freshman
squad all year, i: hopeful of victory for
his team. "We will try to get the jump
on Berkeley," he said this afternoon,
"and if we do they'll never stop us
short of the goal. Our line is better
than California's and our backs are
their equals. This fact gives us an ad
vantage and, barring accidents, I don't
see how we can lose."
What the outcome of this year's
struggle will be is a matter of consid
erable doubt. From the showing the
California team has made against pre
paratory school elevens it would seem
that Berkeley has an advantage over
the cardinal eleven, but Stanford has a
way of coming up with a rush at the
end of the season. The 190S team may
duplicate the contest of last year,
when, contrary to all expectations,
Berkeley was defeated. Freshmen
games are always a gamble until the
whistle sounds for the end of the
match, because of the .unexpected good
and miserable plays which young and
inexperienced teams go through.
This will be the eleventh annual
struggle for supremacy between the
entering classes of the two great uni
versities. Stanford has won six games
and California four. In the preliminary
games of the season the cardinal
youngsters have defeated Palo Alto
High, 6 to 0; Oakland, 16 to 0; tied
Belmont, 6 to 6, and lost to Santa Clara,
10 to 0.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct. 14.
On the new California field to-morrow
the best eleven football players of
Stanford's entering class will line up
against the same number of men from
the 1908 class of the University of Cal
ifornia. This will decide the freshman
intercollegiate football championship
for 1904.

crutches and there is little possibility
that he will be sufficiently recovered, to
play in the game on Saturday.
The men have been at some disad
vantage in having to practice on the
old field, after the heavy rains had put
it in bad condition. Despite the in
juries received on this account by some
of the men the reserve list was big
enough to fill up the ranks when any
man had to fall out and the line up
now "looks good" to Coach KerfooL
He fully expects his team to win.
Spectators at the game will have a
double pleasure in that they will see
a great game of football played on a
field that is destined to become historic,
but which has never yet felt the rush
of twenty-two collegians in a big inter
collegiate game. The field will receive
its dedication on Saturday. Though
not yet completed it is in condition for
play and will present many features of
unusual interest to those who have not
witnessed the preliminary work of its
construction. The work has cost about
$13,000, the excavation alone entailing
an expense of $4000. There are to be
no Beats reserved.
Not in the history of the game at the
university has there been such belief
In the ability of the freshmen eleven
to defeat the cardinal. There are rea
eons for this. One is found in the un
usual amount of work done on the
baby team. The men have been coach
ed and drilled and nursed by Lee Ker
foot as never before were freshmen
drilled. Again, secret signal practice
has been given the freshmen for the
first time in the history of freshmen
teams. Individual playing and resist
ance to opposition have been encourag
ed and now team work and speed are
being developed. The result is ex
pected to be a victory for California
over Stanford.
Sperry, the halfback who has been
practicing with the varsity, has put in
eame work with the freshmen. He
is a tower of strength and Is in mag*
nificent condition.
Golcher, left half, is perhaps the most
brilliant performer behind the line. He
Is a bit light and cannot be expected
to buck the line for heavy gains, but
he is fast, quick to take an opening
and his runs are always for good gains.
Snowden, right half, is perhaps t<x>
easily fooled by fake plays, but when
on the offensive he is telling at bucks
and is also lleet of foot.
Captain Allen has the confidence of
the team to an unusual degree. He is
a light man, weighing but 160 pounds.
He is quick to think and old players
t-ay a headier performer never handled
a freshmen team.
One circumstance which has contrib
uted to the team's confidence is the
fact that the freshmen scored against
the varsity team in practice a few days
ago, a most unusual happening.
Henriott is keeping out of the game.
His ankle is too weak to permit of his
working on the field in its present con
dition.
Zacharias is to play with a steel
brace cm his arm.
BERKELEY, Oct. 14.â Despite the
fact that Golcher, halfback on the
freshman team, and Booth, who is try
ing to make quarterback on the var
sity, are suffering from injuries, confi
dence in the victory of the California
team to-morrow is supreme among Its
members.

day and to-morrow as open dates. The
fleet of the California Yacht Club will
cruise over to Sausalito this evening
and will drop anchor off the clubhouse.
To-morrow the fleets of the San Fran
cisco and California clubs will cruise
outside the heads in company.
Next Sunday, the 22d inst., will be
closing day for the San Francisco
Yacht Club. On the following day the
closing cruise of the season will be
made on signal from the flagship.
The Corinthians will cruise to Corin
thian Cove on the 22d, where the an
nual games will be held on Sunday.
Saturday, the 29th inst., will be closing
day. and on Sunday, the 30th inst., the
last. cruise of the fleet in squadron will
take place. The California yachtsmen'
also will hold their closing entertain
ment on Saturday, Â« the 29th, and their
last scheduled cruise on the 30th.
The stormy weather last Sunday
kept most of the yachts of the Sari
Francisco and Corinthian clubs at their
moorings, though a few made short
cruises in the afternon. Among the
boats under way were the flagship
Challenger, the sloops Ariel and Cur
lew. The little Corinthian sloop Ruby,
which has her regular moorings off
North Beach, cruised over to Tiburon,
returning the same afternoon.
The Corinthians were to have cruised
last Saturday evening to Paradise
Cove and to have field ' a small yacht
regatta there last Sunday. The weath
er, however, was so unpropltious on
Saturday afternoon that Port Captain
John H. Keefe decided to make the
Tiburon clubhouse the headquarters of
his hospitable preparations. He tele
phoned to as many of the yacht own
ers as he could 'reach, bidding them to
partake of a boiled dinner. Corned
beef and cabbage, boiled' ham, clam
chowder and : other : good things were
served in the big room of the club
house, where a cheery log fire blazed.
In spite of the rough weather E. F.
Sager, S. S. Marshall, "Jack" Short,
with "Jerry" and "Jack" Stack, went
aboard the sloop Edna and sailed to
Vallejo, which they reached in two and
a ! half hours. They : returned to ; moor
ings in Belvedere Cove about noon on
Sunday.

According to Their Past
Performances.
Da SUva Indicted Again.
A second Indictment was presented
by the Federal Grand Jury In the
United States District Court yester
day against Lee Toy and H. L. A. Eca
da Sllva. It charges them Jointly with
having imported into the United State3
for Immoral purposes Yuen Choy Fung
and Lee Gum Kew. females. A bench
warrant was issued for the arrest of
the accused and ball fixed at J5000
each. They are already under $5000
bonds each.
The tennis players are planning
many tournaments for the winter
months. If the weather is at all fav
orable the California Club and park
courts will be busy with match play
almost every Sunday and holiday.
There are more players here than
ever before and the game is winning
devotees every day.
The newly appointed tournament
committee of the California Tennis
Club met during the week and ar
ranged a schedule for the remainder of
the year. The continuous tournament
will be revived, but will be run in a
different manner from those held In
the past. The last event of this kind,
held three or four years ago, was suc
cessful while it lasted, but as usual
the interest soon died out.. All of the
active players of the club have been
classified. There are four classes, ten
players In Ihe first, twenty-one in the
second, eighteen in the third, and thir
ty in the fourth. When the continu
ous tournament is started the players
ir each class will draw for places.
Each player will have the right to
challenge the man above him, but if
beaten cannot rechallenge him until
the man below has been disposed of.
If the man directly above him is not
present he may challenge the player
two or three numbers above him. In
no case can a player challenge one
more than three numbers ahead of
him. At the end of every three
months prizes will be awarded the
player ranking No. 1 and to the two
players who have advanced the most.
This tournament will make It possible
to classify the players strictly on per
formances. '
Aside from the continuous tourna
ment there will be other events held
on Sundays and holidays. On the 30th
of this month there will be a handicap
doubles tournament for the Directors'
cups. On Thanksgiving day there will
be a - handicap singles event and on
Christmas r day a scratch doubles. In
the latter tournament partners will be
drawn by lot. As usual a class sin
gles tournament will be held New
Year's day. It is the intention of the
committee to hold ladles' and mixed
doubles tournaments also.
The active players of the club were
classified as follows:

A G. Annesley has becoms a member of
the Paclflo Cricket Club.
It was intended to wind rvD the
cricket season of 1904 with a match
between the winners of the cham
pionship and an eleven made ur> from
other clubs in the California Cricket
Association. As San Francisco County
won the championship the combined
eleven would have been made up of
Alameda. Pacific and Santa Crtia In
about equal proportions. The match
was to have been played at Santa
Cruz, but the season has so far ad
vanced that the game will be de
clared off.
M. H. McAllister, Harry Babcock,
Colonel R. E. Eddy, the Gerber broth
ers, Henry Fortman, Dr. Davis, Mr.
Eells. I. Upham, W. R. Whittler, W. F.
Whlttier and other well-known sports
men will be oft the Suisun marsh as
usual.
E. E. Drake, W. S. Wattles, Clar
ence Nauman and Charles Lalng are
on the V. M. C. Club preserye this
morning trying to reduce the visible
supply of ducks.
James P. Sweeney will shoot ducks
on his preserve at Mowries this morn
ing and will go to the Empire preserve
for quail to-morrow. The quaii are
plentiful in Monterey County and the
club members are assured of good sport
in quest of them.
The members of the Spooney Gun
Club who will be on their Mount Eden
preserve are: Dr. J3. N. Short, L.
Brommer, L. R. Larzalere, Dr. A. T.
Hervy, William Wolf, George Morse,
Rod Guyette and John Miles.
A number of members of the Family
Club have organized under the name
of the Canvasback Club and have pur
chased 300 acres of marsh land near
Suisun for a preserve. They are neigh
bors of Hermann Oelrichs and Joe
Harvey. Phil Bekeart, Ned Dimond
'and Mr. Titus are the leading spirits
in the new club.
Hermann Oelrichs has made elabor
ate arrangements to give the ducks a
warm reception at his private pre
serve. Among the necessities he has
provided are 6000 shells. It will keep
himself and his friends busy for some
time disposing of these.
A. M. Cummlng, A. Roos. L. . Harp
harn. Milt. Unger and other members
of the Field and Tule Club expect good
sport on their Suisun preserve.
N. H. Hickman, E. Courtney Ford,
Fred Johnson, William Stanford,
Frank Maskey and others will try their
skill at the Point Reyes Club preserve.
John Bourdette and L. D. â¢ Owens
will shoot over the famous Prlngle
pond. **â¢ ,t.'
Otto Feudner will shoot as a free
lance this season. He made the rep
utation of the Stewart pond last year,
getting the limit nearly every time he
went out.
The season during which ducks may
be killed within the law will open this
morning, and a host of sportsmen will
be on the marshes at dawn to greet the
feathered tribe. A list of the men who
will be out would mean a roster of al
most every person who possesses a
breechloader.
The pressure on the ammunition deal,
ers has been so great, especially for
hand-loaded shells and for decoys, that
orders have been refused right and left.
It Is evident that the owners of pre
serves expect great sport from the
preparations they are making.
Old duck shooters claim there are
more birds within tho borders of the
State than have ever been seen here
before so early in the season. There has
been a desperate winter In the north
and the birds have been driven out of
their quarters. As the storm has been
general it is supposed the birds have
come straight through without stop
ping at the Oregon lakes, as they have
done in other years.
Two flocks of canvasbacks and many
bluebills have been seen at Collinsville,
something unheard of in other years at
this date.
There Is a wide difference of opinion
as to the number of birds which will
be seen to-day at the various preserves.
The unusual weather conditions of the
past few days have left the sportsmen
at sea, and they can only hope for good
sport. Had the rain held off limit bags
would have been the Jot of all the
shooters. As it is, the rain has not sent
all the birds to the green feed, so the
majority of sportsmen should be able to
show good strings to-night.
The members of the Empire Gun Club
are among those speculating on the
sport in store for them. Some weeks
since their splendid preserve in Mon
terey County was literally carpeted
with fine fat ducks. The rain has scat
tered these to some extent, and wheth
er others will take their places is the
question which will be settled to-day.
Among those who will shoot over the
preserve are Con Roman, F. S. Judah,
Dr. G. G. Gere, C. A. Bennett, R. L.
White, John Pennlngton, J. H. Durst,
Guy T. Wayman. F. Blair Turpin, J. P..
Hauer, L. H. Allen, J. S. Erownell, J.

lops in the main event of the Hayes
Valley Club's show last night the big
crowd of fight fans got a run for their
money that has never been surpassed
at any amateur meeting. Peterson won
in the final round by putting McDonald
down for the count. The latter came"
back fighting, and again he went to the
carpetl He had still another comeback,
and when the bell tapped both men
were mixing it at a furious pace. Peter

thrown from his seat, but sustained

on downs. Dietz kicked to center and
the half ended.
In the second half the ball seesawed
back and forth until about the middle
of the half. Neither side had a per
ceptible advantage until Seminario,
Lick's left halfback, foolishly at
tempted to pick the ball up on a kick
instead of falling on it. This poor
judgment on his part almost cost Lick
the game. Polytechnic got the ball on
Lick's thirty-six-yard line and from
then until the game ended the Lick
goal was constantly in danger. Lick
got the ball on her own fifteen-yard
line on a fumble, but Moullen made a
miserable kick of only fifteen yards
into touch. Polytechnic worked the
ball to the twenty-yard line when the
whistle sounded and the game was
over. . Â»
Polytechnic gained more ground than
Lick, but also fumbled more. Lick
kicked and handled kicks much better
than Polytechnic. I
The first half was a good exhibition
of snappy football, but the second half
was full of squabbling and dragged for
over an hour. In this half Dietz made
a quarterback run of forty yards, but
made a forward pass when tackled.
For this the ball was brought back to
where It was before put into play.
Many thought the ball should have
been down where the forward pass was
made:
The lineup follows:
Lick. Position. Polytechnic.
O'Connor L. E. R...McKenzle (c)

Moullen L. G. R Bonlfleld

Merrltt R. H. L Boarman
Snell F Edwards
Officials â Weldon and - Booth. Time of
halvesâ 25 and 20 minutes. Scow â Lick " 4,
Polytechnic 0.
Aside from Dietz's runs Lick was
able to gain but little ground. Poly
technic time and time again made their
yards, but invariably fumbled when
they had a chance to score. Edwards
was Poly's most consistent ground
gainer.
On the first play after the kick off
Polytechnic fumbled and lost the ball
on j her â¢ own twenty-yard line. Lick
gained five yards and lost the ball on
a fumble. Polytechnic kicked for thir
ty yards, but Dietz ran it in thirty
yards. Moullen was called from the
line to try a field goal and made a
splendid kick, the ball sailing right be
tween the goal posts.
After being scored against "Poly"
fought desperately and by advancing
the ball five yards at a time soon had
it on Lick's fifteen-yard line. Lick
braced at this point and took the ball
Before one of the largest crowds that
ever witnessed an Academic League
football game in this city the elevens
from Lick and Polytechnic high schools
struggled for supremacy yesterday on
the Presidio grounds.
The field was slippery and treacher
ous and it was a difficult matter to get
a footing. Lick carried off the honors
after the most desperate struggle seen
here this season. Early in the first half
Moullen, Lick's left guard, kicked a
field goal, scoring four points for his
team. Neither side scored after this,
although Polytechnic came near doing
so toward the latter part of the game.
Dietz, Lick's quarterback, was the
star of the game. This was his first
attempt at this position and he handled
the team well. His running in of punts
from the back field was a feature.
Every time he caught a punt he would
run the ball in from ten to thirty yards.
The slippery field did not seem to
bother him in the least. .

The gridiron itself will be of turf,

grow. An elaborate system of drain
age has been Installed, so that the
Â¦ field cannot remain wet for long after
it stops raining. The grounds are
within easy walking distance from the
Southern Pacific and Key Route Â»ta
tlons and spectators should be able \o
reach the field from the ferry station
at the foot of Market street almost as

This year is the first time that inter
collegiate championship games have
been scheduled to take place on ths v
home grounds of either of the rivals.
According to arrangements already
made the next championship games
will be played at Stanford, but It Is
thought by many people interested
that the probability of a light attend
ance and the certainty of poor
grounds will result in the transfer
ence of next year's game to Califor
nia's new field or. back to San FrÂ»rt

The game was broken up in the third,

landed on Van Buren's error. Ganley
sacrificed and Francks hit to short.
Again Van dropped the ball and this
After the third round of . yesterday's
game at Recreation Park had passed
into history it was curtains with the.
Seals. They never had a chance to win
in any old inning:. In the third Mr.
Van Buren sought the lofty altitude,,
and there he remained while the Com
muters were busy sending a delegation,
of three over the robber. Score â Oakf
land 5, San Francisco 1.
The game was delayed for fifteen
minutes on account of rain. \When it
did start the teams played some fair
baseball considering that they were be
ing forced to perform on a field that
was not t quite as dry as gunpowder.
Oakland pulled off two lightning double
plays. Francks' muff of an exceeding
ly hard chance was the only miacue
charged up against them. Â¦ -
Moskiman pitched grand ball, and al
though the Seals landed for nine bin
glers and got five bases on balls they
were lucky to reach home even once.
Barber was effective, but the errors be
hind him offset his efforts and allowed
the Commuters to score every run save
one, and that was a gift from the um
pire.

to th|rd and Francks to second. Dun
leavy happened along with a drive to
left at this Juncture, bringing in both

-McCarthy made a bad ruling in the
fifth, when Dunleavy lifted a long fly
out to left field. Hildebrand got the
ball, but being afraid of slipping threw
it after holding it momentarily. Mc-
Carthy said "fair" and ruled that Dun

had erred. Dunleavy was sacrificed

meeting next Monday. The unanimity
of opinion yesterday would indicate
that no difficulty will be experienced in
having the Supervisors confirm the
action of the committee. â¢
Jimmy Britt will come up from San
Mateo to-day and will hold a consulta
tion with his brother-manager as to
where he will make his training camp.
Xt will be either the Seal Rock House
at the ocean beach or Croll's Gardens,
Alameda.' Britt has a strong liking for
the quarters across the bay, but? the
management of the club is urging him
to train here,, where his quarters would
be readily accessible.
, Cans took 1 ;* run on. the road yester
day morning. The rain. prevented him
from ffping.'again in the afternoon. His
manager will join the camp to-day.
Herford is confident that his protege
will makefile -.weight and be fit. Gans
will weigh,; in the , presence of news
paper men';at intervals to show he will
be on hand in proper condition on the
night of, the- fight- . ,. .

that hisj bi-other is ready to sign arti
cles to meet Young: Corbett, win or lose
with Gans. If defeated he says: he
still re/tains the feather-weight cham

the lightweight honors. â¢Â¦ ; .-._.'Â¦'..

CHICAGO, Oct. 14. â Frontenac, one
of the good sons of Kingston, found
a fast track to his liking in the third
race at Worth to-day and won as he
pleased from J. W. O'Neill and Nannie
Hodge. He was a heavily played choice,
being backed from 7 to 5 to 6 to
5 at post time. J. W. O'Neill was
backed from IS to 5 to 16 to 5. Xan
nie Hodge was third choice at 4 to 1.
The three finished as placed in the

A set of resolutions from the Ala

sociation was read. The Alameda
men claim they have been treated
badly by the association and state
their grievances in a lengthy article.
The club, however, has not resigned
from the association. President
Hinchman says it has not yet paid its
dues arid therefore has no power to
resign.

MEX WHO COXTROIi AMATEUR
ATHLETES HOLD A SESSION
NEW YORK. Oct. 14. â The entire
racing stable of W. C. Whitney, which

name and in the colors of H. B. Dur
yea, was sold to-day at Morris Park.
The two stars of the sale were Artful,
winner of the Futurity, and Tanya,
winner of $58,000. Both were bought
by Harry P. Whitney, who paid $10,
000 for Artful and $7000 for Tanya.
Heart's Desire, b. f., by Hamburg-
Admiration, was sold to Mrs. Harry
P. Whitney for $4000. Sidney Paget

Son of Late Racing Magnate Secures
Artful and Tanya, the Stars
of the Sale.
Jerry O'Shea, lessee of the park.
charged Coleman with being the crook
edest man on the field and of being
a defaulter, but Coleman said his de
falcation had been made good. Coleman
created much laughter when he ex
plained how the "doping" was done,
and' that .dog owners were In the habit
of giving each other the double-cross,
having preparations of^their own to
"dope" the dogs.
Chairman Pierce, of the Greyhound
Owners' Protective Association, said
that Coleman had always denied using
"dope" in several investigations.
"If he is telling the truth now," said
Pierce, "we are glad to get at It."
Dominick Shannon, who still retains
a third interest in the park, said he re
gretted that conditions were bad at
the park, owing to children and women
being allowed to gamble and to the
use of "dope." He gave some inside
history on that point.
"The slow dog," said Shannon, "is
given a pill of glycerin, strychnine and
hot ginger, while the fast dog was
given a capsule of laudanum, and to
make assurance doubly sure a little
aconite was administered." Shannon
was still on the stand when an adjourn
ment was taken until next Friday at
3:30 p. m. *
Special Police Officer W. T. Hooper, (
of the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, said he had never
seen anything wrong with the animal
part of the park, but had seen women
drinking in the restaurant, but not at
the bar. He modified his statement on
being questioned by Dominlck Shan
non, who was formerly manager of the
coursing park, by saying that large
boys had carried wagers to the betting
ring. Hooper admitted that dogs could
be "doped" without his knowledge, and
that dogs had been compelled to race
against the protest of their owners.
Thomas Coleman, who was ruled off
at Ingleside Park, testified that he had
given a dog trainer named Zamblage
some "dope" In liquid form, which he
had manufactured himself, and it was
used in the Young Fearless-Rector
race.
Patrolman J. F. McEntee said he had
never seen women and children in the
betting ring and good order was main
tained at the park at all times. He
never had seen any disturbance there,
nor made an arrest, nor seen drinks
carried to women. Patrolman E. J.
Winters gave the patrons of the park
a good reputation for sobriety, saying
that during sixteen months of his serv
ice he had only seen one women intoxi
cated, and she came from town.
The Supervisors" joint Committee on
Judiciary ami Police met yesterday to
take testimony on the conduct of cours
ing at Ingleside Park. This was done
in order that action may be taken on
the proposed ordinance to repeal the
existing law legalizing: for a limited
period gambling on coursing matches.
Supervisor Comte had introduced the
ordinance on allegations made that the
dogs are "doped" and that women and
children are permitted to gamble and
\o drink on the grounds.

FOR FRIDAY. OCTOBER 14.
Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT â Foreign markets were firm, but
dull for cargoes. Futures were easy. Chicago
rose 2<ftc.
The San Francisco market did not follow tile
Chicago' advance and futures were quiet and
only %c higher on the mornlnt; aeeslon. The
feeling was bearish and the disposition wan
to sell on any advance. The cash grain was
easy and dull, with buyers still holding oft.
The situation In the East Is very curious
and unusual, -fur will be seen from the follow
ing from the Chicago Record-Herald of yes
terday: "Kansas City has ecld and shipped a
great deal of Wheat to Minneapolis. St. Louis
sold and shipped to Interior milling points in
Ohio and Indiana. Millers In Detroit have been
buying in Duluth. Chicago, Minneapolis and
Rochester millers have been buying Oregon
Wheat. Minneapolis haa> void and shipped to
Duluth. Kansas Is shipping to Texas and Cali
fornia millers. New England In buying flour
In Portland, Or., and Cincinnati haa bought
Wheat In Baltimore and brought it West, while
Kansas City is beginning to ship Wheat back
to interior Kansas millers. We should be on
the outlook for strange developments."
Kansas City wires: "Buyers will have to
come up to get the Wheat here. Some sales
2 Via to 3c higher. Allan Logan is asking 6c
higher than yesterday and says he can sell to
a mill this evening at that." St. Louis irired:
"One milling firm in the Southwest has bought
one million bushels and another four hundred
thousand bushels of Orepon Wheat. These
millers usually buy here." .: :-Â¦-.<,â¢

I a heavy Invoice, but there was no decline in
Â¦ prices and the market closed firm at the pre
j viou?ly quoted rates. Sales of selected lots
: of Salinas Burbanks were still reported at $1 40
per cental, but for the general market $1 3S
wu considered an extreme figure. The bulk
of the available supplies of Onions were held
by a few dealers and they wera quoted firm at
â¢ a narrower range of prices.
Prices of miscellaneous vegetables showed
considerable revision String. Wax and Lima
I Beans and Green Okra were firmer, while other

Butter, Cheese and Epscs.
, Quotations for fine creamery Butter arÂ«
j getting irregular again and there Is a margin
I of 2c between the quotations of. tha different
i dealera. Some quote the market very stiff.
I while others say it is becoming top-heavy and
I weak. Retailers* report that thay are paying
31c and even higher for the best brand*. Under
these circumtsances the quotations below are
moderate. The lower grades of Butter were
quoted dull yesterday, an a number of houses
have some hot -weather Butter still on hand
which they have been carrying for a fortnight
and e"t\n longer, and which they are now work
; Ins off at very lov.' prices.
Cheese and Esrs show no change. Fine

The vjet weather restricted trad* In fresh
fruits, but as receipts were comparatively
Â¦ liÂ£ht prices of rtesirable stock were wl! main
tained. Dry lots of table Grape? In crates and
i open boxes sold off well, the best offerings in
I crates selling at CC@75c and open boxts at
. *l-f<l 25, while stock that showed tiie effects
1 of the late rains sold at irregular prices. Of
j ferings In small boxes were generally poor and
I dragged badly at easy rate*. Figs were offer'
r ing rather freely and met with prompt sale.
! Offering's in crates from Martinez brought $1 50
I pe r crate and late arrivals from Stockton sold
Â¦ at 75cig$t per box. Trade in Apples continued
: active, but fancy stock was quoted lower, there
1 being nothing on the market that would bring
â¢ the previous high quotations. The other tree
I fruits showed little change, supplies of all
; descriptions being ample. Melons were very
' dull at easier rates, and nearly all of the re
j ceipta'of Cantaloupes and Nutmeg Melons were
I of poor quality and hard to sell at any price.
. Attractive lots of Berries sold off well enough.
! while rain-damaged lots dragged. A consider-
I able portion of the receipts of Raspberries went
[ to the canners at the Inside quotation. Cran
: berries were quiet, particularly for Coos Bay
I stock, some lots of which have been limited at
i higher prices than the trade will pay.

NEW YORK. Oct. 14.â The activity of the
rtock market reached the boiling point to-day
â¢ Tia trailing took on the appearance of the
Â»reat bull markets of a few years ago. It \n
highly probable that the sources of the buying
hevf widened with the recent v!c!ent ad
vances In the market surd *otne out?lde par
ticipation may be thut represented Ccjn
rjlRElcn houses through which thin kind of
business is un-ally transacted, however, report
that their business if riill restricted. Jt Is cer
tain that ver> larpe transactions in to-day's
market were executed by single nouner. buy-
Ing orders for single firms runmrjf as high
a* fifty thousand share? of various storks.
This points unmistakably to th<? centralized
direction and control of operation under com
bined resources. Bacb dealings were especial
ly noticeable to-day in a few of the stocks
In which centered the Rrcateyt activity ani In
which the Â«i.1eÂ«t advances occurred, but the
movement became so general and so em
bracing aa to carry general conviction of a
Â»id> participation in t!>e market from many
â¢eparate and independent sources. The con
viction was very general alro that a veteran
cperator and turfman who has long refrained
from laadinr opÂ«rfctinnÂ» in the market was
*rÂ«'.n oondurting transactions on a large
Â»cÂ«jÂ« by verr charai-teris.tlc methods. The
movement carried Â»ll before It from whatever
â¢ouro*s It came or for what motive*. The
Ilct of separate Issue* dealt tn was longer
than at Â«r.jr time this year. Yesterday and
to-day tii* number of lens dormant issues
which moved required constant industry to
trsce tlie former transact '.ci:a> Jn order to
make price comparisons. The uneaficciw" which
Â«M rÂ»uÂ»-1 yesterday by the comparative
neglect of the railroad Ktcxkr while lotr srrada
ar.d unknown industrials and specialties cb
eorbed all epeculctive attention wae relieved
to-day fcy the revived animstlon cf the stand
ard railroad stock*. These were not all shares
in the outaet In the market's strength, but
before thÂ« day was over practically all im
portant stock* had moved forward a point or
more. There were one or two slight pauses
in the extreme activity cf the market during
*hf day. but it was enly when prices fell
fjjick elirhtly. AggretsJve buying on each oc
t-.iticn reawakened the animation of the mÂ«r
kit and carried it to new high levels until
iSe final dealinsc. wh*n free ruling mingled
â¢with the new advances made the closinjr Ir
r-su'.ar. Epeclnc news had little to do with
t:.e day's movcmwit but a rtrcmg mlmulation
v.a5 civen to thÂ« market by the unexpectedly
'irrje gain In cash promised by to-morrow'*
bank etAtezsent. The transfers on balance by
expresa to the Interior have been so small
rhls week that only an Insign'.flrant reduction
has to be made from the amount yielded to
the banks on Â»ub-treaÂ«ury operations, which
Â¦ mounted to W.03T.C00. The exchange at
Chicago aJfto narrowed the discount 15 per cent
per thousand compared with 30 cents earlier
in the week.
The exhaustion of other crop supplies and
Ttm waiting for the new crop of corn may
account for this pause in the interior rnove
f:. Call money. In consequence, la very
to-day. The favorable turn In the Gov
lent's income of revenue Rives confidence
no call upon the national banks for
rit* la likely to be made. While thÂ« ln
fiiBtriale and cpccialties maintain their new
found prominence the demand, for the atajid
*rd rtock* was commensurate with their repre
iÂ«nta.Uve importance. Gains -of 1 to 2>4 point*

CHICAGO Oct. 14.â Inability i>f domestic
flour mills to secure wheat suitable for grind-
Ing was thrt main cause of an advance of over
2 cents a bushfl in tho price of wheat options
hp r Â«Â» to-driy. A bic shortage In the French
crop added to the feeling of buoyancy. At the
close December wheat was up 2%c. May
closed with a tain of 2V&C. Corn Is up %Â».
Oats shuw a net gain of He. Provisions are
off 7l4@12Vic.
For the first hour sentiment In the wheat
pit was Inclined to weakness. At the opening
the December option was unchanged to V&Q
lower at $1 10 1 -! <3 1 10*Â»c. May was $40%e
lower to \*@Y\c higher at $1 10@l 10'^. The
easier undertone at the start was due to lower
cables and to liberal receipts in the Northwest.
On fair Mlllntr of May by eommlrsion houses
the market underwent a further recession, the
distant delivery declining to $1 00%. Decem
ber also reacted to ?1 "OTi- At the samÂ« time,
however, all outside markets exhibited decided
strength. The Influence of these higher prices
soon had an appreciable effect on trading here.
A nromlnent commission house was a heary
purchaser of the December option. The con
tinued buying by this concern was largely in
etrumental In starting active buying by the
pit crowd. The keynote to tne situation, how
ever, was apparently the great scarcity of
wheat for milling purposes. Reports from the
Northwest and Southwest were equally bullish
In that respect. On? mrsi'a&e from St. Louis
alleged an 'absolute wstrclty of milling wheat
there. A iÂ«tatt.'ment from Minneapolis that two
<;f the biBKPst elevator companies will handle
or.lv 5<> to 70 per cent of the amount of wheat
stored last year formed a cement background
for the eeneral firmness. Another factor was
a report of a St. Ixniis trade Journal claiming
that exresflvo rains in the Southwest and
drouth conditions in the Northwest have de
layed seeding of winter wheat to some extent.
These bullish domestic advices were reinforced
by a report of the French Minister of Agri
culture aesresatirg a shortage of 737.00Â»Â»,OOi>
bunhelR In this year's crop of wheat a* com
pared with that of last year. Throughout the
latter part of the cession shorts were urgent
buyers, the December option being In greatest
favor. Prices advanced rapidly until Decem
ber sold at $1 13. May rallied to $1 12%.
The strength was well maintained. December
closing at $1 12 : ii. while final quotations on
May were at *1 12HC1 32%.
Clearances of wheat and Tour were equal to
37.300 bushels. Exports for the week as rtiown
by Urn<lÂ»treet'Â« were, eijual to 1.. "557,001) -bush-,
els. Primary receipts were 1. 838,000 bushels.
compared with 1.235,7Cf> bis'ie.'* a year ago.
Minneapolis, Duluth and Chicago reported re
ceipts of tÂ»2S car*, against l>27 cars last week.
Karly in the session thÂ» corn market was In
clined, to weakness, mainly !n sympathy with
the eaMer tone of wheat. The market lacked
the support of the big houses that were active
buvors yesterday, an'l for the first hour trading
was rather quiet. The sharp advance in wheat
brought out a good dema.nd for corn from
Bliortf. nnd. the lesult was a strong market
late In the day. December or>enoÂ»1 unchanged
to ma'4c lower at 40^Â«74!> I t c to 49%c. sold
off to 48'5ic. rallied to 30? 5 e and closed at
SO^ic Ijocal receipts were 67 cars, with one
of contract grade.
The governing factor in the oat. 1 " market was
the action of wheat and corn. Trading was
rather light owing to the heavy movement and
to the accumulation of stocks. After opening
lower at 28% c, December ranged between
2SUc and 29*4c. and closed at 29c. Local re
ceipts were 05 cars.
Selling of lard by a prominent packer was
the leading factor In the hog market. At the
close Januarv uork was down 12Vsc at
812 27%. Lard and ribs were each 7%c lower
at $7 17Vi ar.d $S 42Vj respectively.

The mystery surrounding the disap
pearance of Miss Bertha Ebert still
remains unsolved. Dr. Petrie Hoyle,
who is referred to in the telegram
sent to the missing girl by her sister,
Sophie Ebert, from Bay City, Mich.,
can throw but little light upon the
subject. He says he is the manager
and resident physician of the Occi-
Orlent Medicine Company, with, offices
in the Starr King building. He states
that Miss Ebert began working for
them earlv in June. She left their
employ on October 4, giving as a
reason that she was offered a better
position. That was the last they
heard of her.
Dr. Hovle scouts the idea of suicide.
He says that when she left their em
ploy she had $50. As to her where
abouts he was absolutely at a loss to
offer any solution. Further than that
he knew nothing.

In rendering his decision on the Du
ran accusation the Judge said, in part:
It is inÂ»i?ted by the complainant that to
â¢ci 5n Â«cfss of thf authority of an office is
to refuse or nerl**ct to perform thp official
duties pertaining to tbe office. This does not
elate * proper rule of construction. It Is not
to be assumed that the legislature In adopt
ing saSd section 772 Intended thereby that a.
public officer showing diligence and actinK in
rood faith â¢would be liable to remoral from
effloe and pay a fine and corts by way of pun.
lsfcrceEt merely because he may exhibit an
urdue zeal or act erroneo-aslj in tbe discharge
of Ms duties. In the effort to correctly In
terpret the provision under consideration no
strained or artificial construction should be
ravored with the resalt that lauda.ble teal on
the part of public officers should in Â±r.y man
ner be discouraged and a premium rlared on
indifference to the proper clium* Jf public
duty. It Is the view of the Â«Hirt that the
Â«f>cnsatlon does not state a case within the
xneacln* of tbe F.-Jd section n2.
Attorney Collins took an exception to
the Judge's ruling and intimated that
he would apply to the Supreme Court
for a writ of mandamus to compel the
Jud?e to hear the merits of the case.
Collins has also laid the matter before
the Grand Jury, under section 759 of
the Penal Cnde, which authorizes tbe
Orar.d Jury to present for removal
from office any officer guilty of Â¦willful
or corrupt misconduct in office. Pro
ceedings under this section involve the
finding of an indictment and the prose
cution of the charge by the District
Attorney before a Jury In the Superior
Court.
Police Commissioner H. W. Hutton.
'"special chief of police for 1129 Dupont
street," scored a point before Judge
Lawlor yesterday in winning his de
murrer to the accusation of Mary Du
ran, who seeks to remove him from
office unflpr sÂ«n:tion 772 of the Penal
Code. Judpre Lawlor granted the mo
tion to dismiss. Then a petition was
filed with Judge lawlor for a writ of
mandamiis to compel Mayor Schmitz
to forthwith appoint a successor to
hold the office of Police Commissioner
"heretofore occupied by Hutton. and
now made vacant by virtue of section
10, article 16 of the charter, Hutton
having been convicted and sentenced
by Judge Cook for contempt of court in
violating the injurction restraining the
police from interfering with the res
taurant business of Jean Pon." The
petition Is signed by Peter Rubino and
Â¦was fJed by Attorney George D. Col
lins. The Judge granted an alterna
tive v.-rit and made it returnable before
himself next Tuesday morning.

Joe Mulhatton, who was arrested for
stealing a tattered coat and leaving
his own worthless garment in its place,
was discharged by Judge Mogan. The
man's conduct indicated Insanity; but
the Lunacy Commissioners declined to
examine' him because no formal com
plaint had been filed with them.
Friends of the unfortunate fellow will
send him to relatives in Washington,,
D. C.
Mrs. Nellie Kelly and Mrs. Julia Mc-
Carthy, sisters, denied that they dis
turbed the peace of their neighbors,
Mr. and Mrs. Augusto Menclno of 32
Pixley avenue. The defendants were
attired in severe black and so modest
was their demeanor as they stood be
fore Judge Mogan that it was difficult
to believe them guilty as charged by
the complainants. Mr. Mencino aver
red that the sisters frequently got
drunk and while in that condition
amused themselves by berating Mrs.
Mencino, calling her a "dirty dago"
and other names even more Insulting.
Mrs. Mencino would probably have tes
tified to the same effect if she had been
able to speak English or if there had
been an Interpreter to translate her
testimony. As the defendants stoutly
pleaded innocence of any offense and
emphatically promised to abstain from
offending the Mencinos in future they
were discharged from custody. .
â¢ * â¢
A similar term of imprisonment was
prescribed for Ella Magreany, middle
aged and tattered, who ran away from
Patrolman Nelson when he attempted
to arrest her for vagrancy on lower
Jackson street. So swiftly did she
sprint that the officer, who is something
of a track athlete, was about to re
linquish his pursuit as hopeless when
she indiscreetly bolted into a restau
rant that happened to have no rear
exit. She was found concealed in the
kitchen.
â¢ ,- â¢ â¢
Mogan was Ingenious, but unsuccess
ful.
"I am troubled with heart weakness,"
she said, "and my physician instructed
me to stimulate the action of the af
fected organ by drinking whisky when
ever I felt an attack coming on. That's
how I happened to beg a drink In those
three saloons."
Then the policeman testified that the
defendant was an old offender and was
intoxicated when he arrested her. The
Judge sentenced her to three months'
imprisonment.

Frank Ariota, employed by the West
ern Fish Company, was convicted of
having offered for sale a silver bass
which did not exceed a quarter of a
pound weight, whereas the legal mini
mum Is three pounds. After the de
fendant had tried to explain how great
ly fishes shrink after they have been
subjected to atmospheric influence he
was fined $50.
Bradford D. Schell, a furniture deal
er, was intoxicated when he appeared
for trial before Judge Mogan on the
charge of having disturbed the peace of
his wife and her sister, Mrs. Charles
White, and his Honor instructed the
bailiff to take him into custody for
drunkenness In a public place. The de
fendant's wife testified he made her
life so miserable that she left him and
instituted proceedings for divorce, and
that since then he had occasionally vis
ited the home of her brother-in-law,
1216 Mission street, and bullied and
threatened her. He will be sentenced
to-day for both offenses.
John Johnson, able seaman, has been
two months without a ship, and dur
ing that period his sober hours have
been a minority. /)ne of his drunken
pranks was to ring the doorbell of the
Sailors' Home and then run away, and
it was for this offense that he was ar
rested last Thursday night by Patrol
man Sandman and charged with va
grancy. Sentence postponed.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Emile Ravezzinl and Otto Musatti,
12-year-olds, were arrested at 9:30
o'clock Thursday evening as they lay
upon the roof of 524 Green street and
with an air gun popped bullets through
the windows of 533 Green street. The
occupant of No. 533, an Italian gentle
man, had squirted seltzer water on the
boys while they were playing at his
doorway, and it was to "get even" that
they perforated his windows. Judge
Mogan will sentence them for disturb
ing the peace.
Frank Snowden and William Schemil
flnie, 16-year-old boys whom the police
classified as "wharf rats," were caught
in the act of plundering a drunken
man who had fallen asleep in a water
front hallway, and on account of their
youth Judge Cabaniss advised them to
plead guilty of petty larceny and thus
escape conviction of the more serious
offense of robbery from the person.
Master Schemllfinic thereupon said that
he hated to tell a lie, but to please the
Judge he would plead as advised. His
Honor hastened to assure the lad that
the court was not consulting its own
pleasure when it offered the suggestion,
and would not have him commit per
jury for the world. Master S. then hur
riedly confessed himself a petty lar
cenist, apparently realizing that his
show of conscientious scruple had been
rated at its true value. He and his fel
low defendant will be sentenced to-day.
â¢ â¢ â¢
His Honor diplomatically sidestepped
the query by instructing Mrs. Gorman
to state her complaint.
With commendable directness Mrs.
Gorman complied. It was her misfor
tune, she averred, to live in the same
apartment-house, 432^ Sixth street,
with Mrs. Davis and several other
ladies. If it were not for the conduct
of Mrs. Davis a more desirable dwell
ing place could not exist, for all the
other ladies were remarkably amiable.
Mrs. Davis, however, had exerted her
self to make their home life as un
pleasant as she could. It was true that
since she was arrested on the charge
of killing a lady by striking her on the
head with a heavy lamp Mrs. Davis
had not been so highly esteemed as
she was previous to that occurrence
and it was also true that her removal
from the house would be hailed as a
blessed relief by those left behind her.
Perhaps the fact that Mrs. Davis was
promptly acquitted of the aforemen
tioned charge might have impelled her
neighbors to treat her less frigidly and
probably they would do so if she were
not so snobbish. However, no treat
ment that Mrs. Davis could receive
from her neighbors would justify the
retaliation in which she had indulged.
All that Mrs. Gorman had done to in
cur Mrs. Davis' enmity was to simply
ignore her, yet Mrs. Davis deliberately
sprinkled with dirty water the clean
linen that Mrs. Gorman had hung out
to dry. No, the term "murderess" had
never been applied to Mrs. Davis,
either directly or indirectly, by Mrs.
Gorman. Other ladies in the house
might have so addressed her, but Mrs.
Gormanâ never!
In reply to a judicial Inquiry Mrs.
Davis said she was not in love with her
present place of residence and would
have changed it long ago if she had
not imagined that such a step would
have conveyed gratification to the fem
inine combine that was systematically
endeavoring to compel her removal. If
the court desired, however, she would
leave the house as soon as she could
find another one equally suited to her
family's requirements, but she did
not propose to have her offspring sub
jected to any physical discomforts by
such a change.
The Judge thought it would really
be better for the youngsters if they
were transferred to a more congenial
environment and then he gave Mrs.
Davis a week in which to find a new
home.
Holding up a rosy-cheeked, thumb
chewing infant for Police Judge
Mogan's inspection, Mrs. Mary Davis,
a buxom German matron, proudly an
nounced that it was the youngest of
six, the others being equally clean and
healthy. Then, encouraged by his
Honor's approving smile, she proceeded
to proclaim her opinion that a greater
outrage than her arrest for disturbing
the peace of Mrs. Lizzie Gorman had
seldom or never been perpetrated, as
she could prove If the court would give
her the opportunity to do so.
"Mid dis kid und flnf odders ter vash
und dress und mend for und shpank,"
Mrs. Davis said, "I hefn't der dime ter
fighd mid mine neighbors. Ain'd dot
so?"

I "Just as Good"
Grocers
A grocer's integrity is reflected in his
stock. If he is the creature of the un-
principled manufacturer, his goods are
cheap imitations of better ones, which
I he sells under the false representation
of "just as good." No conscientious
grocer will tell a customer that the
cheap imitations of D. Ghirardelli's
Chocolates and Cocoas are just as good
as the genuine. He knows that if they
were of the high quality of the original
he could not receive the greater profit.
He realizes that the success of these
preparations depends on the unprinci-
pled small dealer who will not scruple
to hoodwink his customers for the sake
of a few cents. A good grocer scorns
deceit; he has built up his business
by handling quality goods. The cheap
imitations of the D. Ghirardelli's Choc-
olates and Cocoas have no place in the
good grocer's stock.
I Insist on getting the original and genuine
D. GhirardelWs Chocolate and Cocoa.
All others are imitations.
