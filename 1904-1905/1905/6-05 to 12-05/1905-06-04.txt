Well, I daresay I did { so with - some
freedom, for this plan of his was not tha
less distasteful to me from Us apparent
inevitability. I must own,^however,' that
it possessed fewer terrors before my .glass

He got up, : lit a fresh cigarette and fell
to~ pacing the * room once more, but with
a slower and more thoughtful: step, and
fora much; longer period: than before.
JTwicehe stopped at 7my chair, as though
on the point of ; speaking, but each time
he checked ' himself "arid ; resumed his
stride in: silence. Once he threw up the
window, iwhich- he had. shut some time,
and ' stood for some moments leaning , out
'' into Ii the fog ; which . filled â¢ the , Albany
courtyard. Meanwhile a clock on the
chimneypiece; struck one^- and one again
for the half-hour, without : a word be

The second adventure of Rafflesâ >*A
Costume Piece"â will appear next
(Copyright, 1599, by Charles Scribner's
" Sons.)
IT was about 1^:30 o'clock when I
returned to the Albany as a last
desperate resort. The scene of my
disaster was much as I had left it.
The baccarat counters still strewed
the table, with empty glasses and the
leaded asli trays. A window had been
broken to let the smoke out. and was
letting la the fog Instead. Raffles him
self had merely discarded his dining
jacket for one of his Innumerable
blazers. Yet he arched his eyebrows as
though I had dragged him from his bed.
"Forgotten something?" eaid he, when
he saw me on his mat.
"No," said I, pussing past him with
out ceremony* And I led the way into
\u25a0 his room with an impudence amazing
to myself.
"Not come back for revenge, have
you? Because I'm afraid I can't give it
\u25a0to you single-handed. I was sorry my
â¢self that the others -"
We were face to face by his fireside,
and I cut him
"Raffles," said I, "'you may well be
1 surprised at my coming back In this
way and at this hour. I hardly know
you. I was never In your rooms before
to-night But I * fagged for you at

In my emotion I had at first to strug

assured *me as I went on, and I 'was
not mistaken in its expression.
"Certainly, my dear man," said he,
"as many minutes as you like. Have a

me his silver cigarette case.

'J, won't sit down, thank you. Nor will
you ask me to do either when you've
heard what I have to say."
"Really?" said he, lighting his own
cigarette with one clear blue eye upon
me. "How do" you know?"
Â» "Because you'll probably show me
the door," I cried bitterly, "and you'll
be Justified In doing it: But it's nor

but you can never have met A. J. Raf
fles. Half his power lay in a conciliating,
trick of sinking the commander in the
leader. And It was Impossible not to fol
low one who led with such' a zest. You
might question, but you followed first. So
now. when 1 heard him kick off his own
shoes I did the same and was. on tne
stairs at his heels before I realized what
an extraordinary way was "this of ap
proaching a stranger , for money In the
dead of night. But obviously Raffles and
he were on exceptional terms of .intimacy,
and I could not but Infer Ltatitbey were
in the habit of playing practical jo&es
upon each other.
We groped our way so slowly up
stairs that I bad time to make more
than one note before we reached" the
top. The stair was uncarpeted. The
spread fingers of my right hand en
countered nothing on the damp wall,
ihore of my left trailed through a dust
that could be felt on the banisters. An
eerie sensation had been upon me since
we entered the house. It insreasedi
with every step we climbed. - What her
mit were we going to startle in his
cell?
We came to a landing. The banisters
led us to the left, and to the left again.
Four steps more and we were on an
other landing, and suddenly a match
blazed from the black. I never/ heard it
struck. Its Hash was blinding. When
my eyes became accustomed to . the
light there was Raffles holding up the
match with one hand and shading it
with the other, between .bare boards,
stripped walls and the open doors of
empty rooms.
"Where have you brought me?" I
cried. "The house is unoccupied!"
"Hush! Wait!" he whispered, and he
led the way into one of the empty
rooms. His match went out as we
crossed the threshold and he struck an
other without the slightest noise. Then
he stood with his back to me. fumbling
with something that I could not see.
But when he threw the second match
away there was some other light in Its
stead and a slight smell of oil. I
stepped forward to look over his shoul
der, but before I could do so he had
turned and flashed a tiny lantern in my
face.
"What's this?" I grasped. "What rot
ten trick are you going to play?"
"It's played," he* answered, with his
"Js there no one in the house,, then?"
"No one but ourselves.
"So it was mere chaff about Â»your
friend iff Bond street, who could let
us have that money?"
"Not altogether. It's quite true that
Danby is a friend of mine,"
"Danby?"
"The jeweler underneath."
"What do you mean?" I whispered,
trembling like a leaf as his meaning
dawned upon me. "Are we to get the
money from the jeweler?"
"Well, not exactly."
"The equivalent â from his shop."
There was no need for another ques
tion. I understood everything but my
own destiny. He had given me a dozen
hints and I had taken none. And there
I stood staring at him. in that empty
room, and there he stood with his dark
lantern, laughing at me.
"A burglar!" I gasped. "You â you!"
"I told you I lived by my wits."
"Why couldn't you tell me what you
were going to do? Why couldn't you
trust me? Why must you lie?' I de
manded, piqued to the quick for all my
horror.
"I wanted to tell you," said he. "I was
on the point \u25a0of telling you more than
once. You may remember how I sounded
you about crime, though you have prob
ably forgotten what you said yourself.
I didn't think you meant it at the time,
but I thought I'd put you to the test.
Now I see you didn't, and I don't blame
you. I only am to blame. Get out of it.
my dear boy, as quick as you can; leave
It to me. You won't give me away, what
ever else you do I"
Oh, his cleverness! His fiendish clever
ness! Had he fallen back on threats, co
ercion,- sneers, all might have' been dif
ferent even yet. But he set me free to
leave him in the lurch. He would not
blame me. He did not even bind me . to
secrecy; he trusted me. He knew my
weakness and my strength, and was play-
Ing on both with his master's touch.
"Not bo fast," eaid L "Did I put this
Into your head, or were you going to do
It in any case?**
"Not In any case," said Raffles. "It's
true I've had the keys for days, but
when I won to-night I thought of
chucking: it; for, as a matter of fact.
It's not a one-man job."
"That settles it. I'm your man.**
"You mean it?"
"Yesâ for to-night."
"Good old Bunny." he murmured,
holding the lantern for one moment to
ray face; the next be was explaining
his plans, and I was nodding, as though
we had been fellow-cracksmen all our
days. 4
"I know the shop," he whispered, "be
cause I've got a few things there. I
know this upper part too; it's been, to
let for a month, and I got an order
to view and took a cast of the key
before using It- The one thing I don't
know is how to make a connection be
tween the two; at present there's none.
We may make It up here, though I
rather fancy the basement myself. If
you wait a minute I'll tell you."
He set his lantern on the floor, crept
to a back window and opened it with
scarcely a sound; only to return, shak
ing his head, after shutting the Window
.with the same care.
"That was our one chance,** said he;
"a back window above a back. window;
but it's too dark to see anythin gr, ; and
we daren't show an outside light. Come:
down after me to the basement; sand
remember, though, there's not a soul on
the premises, you can't make too little
noise. There â thereâ listen /to that!"
It was the measured tread that we
had heard . before on the , flagstones
outside. Raffles darkened his lantern.
and again ; we stood motionless till it
had passed. , ; ;
"Either a policeman,"! he muttered,' j
"or a watchman that all these jewelers
run between them. The watchman's;
the man for us, to watch; he's simply
paid- to /spot this kind of thing." -
V/e crept very gingerly down the stairs,
which creaked a' bit in ; spite of -us, -arid
we ' picked up. our shdes In / the passage; '
then down; sonic narrow, stone ;steps, at
th/e . foot of .which Raffles showed*", his*
light 'â¢ and / put - on his shoes â¢ once : inbre,
bidding me do the same in a;rather'loud
er] tone than he had permitted hlm'self; to
employ overhead. AYe were now consid
erably below the level of \ the street.' - f in '\
a Ismail space with as many doors as it
had sides." Three were ajar, and we'#aw
through them into empty cellars;. but- in
the fourth a key was turned and a bolt
drawn, and this one presently let, us out,
into the bottom of a" deep,* square : well of;
fog. A : similar door -faced ' it : this
area, and : Raffles had the lantern close
against It and was hiding the light with
his body when a "short -and sudden \u25a0 crash
made my heart stand still. . Next moment
I saw the door/ wide open and /Raffles
standing within and beckoning me with
a jimmy. .
â¢ "Door number one," he ; whispered. -
"Deuce knows how fnany more there'll
be, but I know of two at least. We won't
have to -make much noise over them,'
either; down here there's less risk."
"We were now at the bottom of .the ex
act fellow to the narrow stone stair
which we had just* descended;, the yard,
or, well," being the one part common to
both the private and the business prem
ises. But this flight led . to ;no open
passage; instead, a singularly, solid ma
hogany, door confronted us at the top. r
' "I thought so.", muttered Raffles, hand
ing me the , lantern and "pocketing" a
bunch of skeleton keys after tampering a
feWminutes with the lock/ "It'll be" an'
hour's work to get through thaf." /
"Can't you pick It?"
"No. I know these locks. It's no use
trjing. We must cut it out, and it'll take
us an hour." ..
It took us forty-seven minutes-by'my
watch, or rather* it took Raffles; -and
never in my life have I seen anything
more deliberately done. My. part was
simply to stand by with the dark lantern;
In one hand and a small bottle of rock
oil in the other. Raffles had produced a
ONE faculty with. which Owena-
Slaivin was blessed was the
happy knack of sleeping where
and when and for what length
of time he chose. If O\ven came
in from his day's work with a keen
appetite for his supper and found that
the pratie pot did not yet show signs
of boilingâ found that . "the while
horses" were not in itâ "Why," he
would say to Peggy, "I'll just bab an
eye till they're ready for teemln'."'and,
sitting on his creeple stool, to the one
side of tho fire, he wquld simply bow
his head and slcer soundly and refresh
ingly for the five minutes or the ten
minutes (as thÂ» case might be) which
were to spare before his services were
requisitioned to link oft the big pot
and teem It from the . doorstep. The
Bummadier prophesied that when 'poor
Owen* 1 * time had come to die (which
God keep afar!), and Peggy and the
priest were standing by his bedside
vvatchlns for the dread moment, Owen
would surely ask them how many
minutes they thought he had, and
forthwith proceed to "bab an eye" for
the allotted time.
And though we youngsters were
amused at Owen's power of falling
asleep, and keeping so, in the ; most
awkward position and under the. most
unfavorable conditions, it was by times
aggravating. When /we were in the
humor for hearing one of the many
brilliant stories; both traditional and
made to order, that Owen could recite
so racily, and when Owen, to our joy,
had consented to "reharse us a rattlin'
good yarn," and we therefore had
quieted down from our frolics and
drawn the circle close around Owen's
hearth .fire (each upon his hauncnes
upon the clay floor), supporting : : our
backs by -clasping our hands around
our knees, it was Just then a trifle
trying .to find that Owen had been
seized with the. bright Idea of "babbins
an eye" while we settled ourselves.
But â Owen's story was always worth
waiting for, as witness this one: :â¢<

was in much the same fix that you were

all Jover with me. "Why should 1 work,

to some humdrum uncongenial â¢billet,
when" excitement, romance,- danger and

fcomehow to learn to ride a bicycle, but who, of
course, never had owned one, had fallen to dream
ing a dream so splendid that at times it startled
him. This dream was based on the great number
of old, battered, rusty wheels that were piled up,
in the back yard â wheels of all sorts, but among
them many of the same kind, some lacking tires,
others pedals, others sprockets, and so on, and not
one that could be ridden in the whole assortment;'
but, as Tommy soon proved, there were so many
that, if he took part from this one and part from
that, it would be possible to make an entire wheel
that would be quite as good as a new one. 1 .
At first he merely dreamed of this, but by and by
he began to sort over these wheels and then to take â¢
them apart. Pretty soon he found himself building
a wheel, and before long there it stood ! He scarcely
realized that he had accomplished the' feat until â¢
he saw it done. It really looked like a new wheel,
for he had selected the best parts of each old, bat
tered wreck, and as he was admiring it Mr. Cruger
entered and eaid:
"Hello! Who sold you that? Pll bet it's a stolen
wheel!"
"Sure! I stole it!" replied Tommy, grinning. 1 '"I
ttole it out of that bunch of old cripples!"
When lÂ£r. Cruger understood that Tommy had
xaade this splendid new wheel, all by his own efforts,
He was amazed and very much pleased.
"You've got a \fine wheel !" said he. ' "It's really
better than a new -one, for all the parts you've used*
are proved ones that have been tested by hard wear,
-and so can be depended upon."^
"You don't mean- that it's mine !" demanded
Tommy.
"Sure! Why not? None of them are any good;'
and you certainly earned it!" replied /Cruger,
laughing. JygÂ»fffiM"P|
THIS is the story of a boy who used his eyes
and his mind whenever Jhe had a chance,
although he never went to school more than
a few months and had but little opportunity to
learn. His name was Thomas Taggs, and he was
born in a narrow, dirty little alley in a great,
6moky city. He never saw a blade of grass until
he was 9 years old, although parks were all* about
the town- Garrets and gutters were his playground
until he was old enough to explore the city and
discover new ones. Then, when he was iO, he' began
to live.
I don't suppose there was" ever a boy who had
so inquisitive a mind as Tommy. Nothing escaped
him. He wanted to know the reason for everything
he saw, and never stopped asking questions until
he had learned all he could about a thing that in
terested him. And what's more important by far,
he never forgot what he had learned. W'?-'';'
So many children lived in that poor and dirty
city that only a few of them managed to go to
school, simply because there was room in the
schools for only half of them; but Tommy went
long enough to learn to read and write, and after
that it would have been impossible to keep such a
smart boy from learning more.
He had found a little dog who turned out to be
as clever as any dog ever 'known. His name was
Pete, and when he was washed and combed he was
also a very handsome dog; but as he hated to be
washed, ho rarely looked llke>a dog, but more like a
mop or a mat. Only his clear, bright eyes showed
how smart be was, but in them was revealed a depth
of wisdom that was surprising.
The two explored all of the city, Tommy looking
for any sort of job that would earn him a few pen
nies and Pete fcr bones that had escaped the eyes
of other dogs. Thus they came to know all the
.secret places of the great, smoky town, and not a
few persons came to know them, also. A clever boy
who is eager to work does not long escape the at
tention of men who want just such boys, let me tell
you; and pretty soon a man who bought old iron,
tin, bottles and other junk hired Tommy to watch
* his -shop and attend to his customers while he went
about with a wagon collecting the stuff.
To say that Tommy was pleased would be to put
' it very mildlr, for in that old shed there was piled
all sorts of wonderful thingsâ machinery,* imple
ments of science, old bools, hardware, bicycles arid
odds and ends without numberâ and among them
dwelt rats of a size that filled Pete with delight,
for he liked to catch rats beyond" all things! So
with rat-catching, the 'study of; tKe strange ob
jects, and the customers, Tommy's time was filled
from daylight until dark, and then he went to bed
in the loft with Pete to dream of making over many
of the old, wornout things and shaping them. into
new usefulness. Old Cruger, the junkman, discov
ered in a few days that the boy was a treasure, f ov
never had so many customers come to his store
and never had the junk been sorted over and ar
\u2666 ranged so neatly before; so he soon left everything
to Tommy and attended solely to his outside busi
â¢ ness. :'*'-;-/. : "'
Xow, Tommy, who like every boy had managed
and there, amidst the gloom, for .such a thing had
\u25a0 never been heard of before. They yelled and shrieked
for.help, and the old high priest was most fright
ened of- them all. Even the king clung toTommy's
arm in fear and trembling. 4 The priests poured out
of the temple in crowds, fleeing before Tommys
Bhbwer" .of fiery" balls ; like v sheep, and the people
gazÂ«d in amazement to. see the .men before whom
they had always bowed shaking in terror as they
ran eway. ' . â¢. â .
-'â¢ Tommy caught'the old high priest by the nape of
his fat neck and hauled him outside, and the. King
followed.' Pushing the ..priest .along until they;
reached the great altar porch, he shouted to the
astonished multitude, which had supposed their
King consumed ;bytho" flames:
"Listen, O citizens of Ghamma, to your good
King's word 3!" "^ y-'* _ .
Tlien'the King made a long speech ana told them
all that had been discovered, and the terrified high
priest confessed aU! Many of, the priests had fled
and concealed themselves, but others came forward
and also confessed, claiming that they had always
thought this stealing of .'the. people's goods to be
wrong," a3 well a3 bad policy on the part of the
priesthood. These men the angry people pardoned,
but the: high priest and many of his confederates
were burned exactly, a3 they^had pretended to bum
the treasures of the lahd.^ - ,v, v - .
Then came a glad and joyful time I When it waa
seen what heaps aÂ£ grain, of gold, silver, jewels, gar*
ments/ statues, ivory, ebony, amber, pearls, dia
monds, rubies, copper, leadâ in fact, heaps of every
thing costly and usefulâ that were piled away in the
vast recesses of that immense and ancient temple
of rogues, the shouting was simply terrific; but be
fore all this treasure - was divided up among the
people of Ghamma, the King ordered the great idol
to be tumbled down" into the public and
split into kindling woodland this command wa3
obeyed with great delight. v
The great eyes of the idol were found to be made
of immense emeralds, which were pried out by^the
King and given to Tommy as souvenirs of the joy
ous occasion. They were as large as baseballs, and
gleamed like huge flames !
Then began the taking out of the vast, uncount
able heaps of treasure in the temple, and it took
ten weeks to bring it all out and divide it among
the citizens. When at last each had received his
share, it was found that every man, woman and
child" in all the land was a millionaire, and 1 the
populace went almost crazy, for, as you may well
imagine, the change from dire poverty to immenso
wealth was almost too. sudden to be taken calmly.
Everything was altered; the people wentto bed*
at . night, but by day - they, gave feasts, picnics and
parties- constantly. They instantly bought ships,
built : ; railroads . and trolley lines, and went ' into
business with the rest of the world, .'selling their
wonderful treasures for money, and in & year 'were
known the world over for their marvelous, ivory,
ebony, pearls and other precious things.

alone knew how to guide the kingdom in, this new
state of things, and they paid him two or three

McDOUGALL'S GOOD
STORIES FOR CHILDREN
not expected, this. 'It .was aVvery happy, moment,"
for the wheel ; was the onlything except Pete that
he had : ever, owned, and he resolved^ to repay" Mr.'
Gruger hy.. makinjj. even greater^ efforts to -please
him. Soon the junkman found that his business
was growing, .because Tommy, managed to select
and lay aside in especially appointed places such
articles as the public: might want, so that when a
customer^ who neecied a 'certain bit of /old iron such
as a boltj/nut> spike or a certain kind of bottle, de
manded it, there it was ready/ for' him among a lot
of others to choose "from. / -
in its place" was Tommy's motto;
and," for once, persons saw a junk-shop where things
could be found when' wanted:*- \- : J. '[;.';. \u25a0 "...â¢- -; ....
- And Tommy soon developed : quite*, a ; business in
bicycle "parts," ; also,- for '^c ; had^taken the ol(l
wheels all apart,, and selecting those things which
were salable ho had polished them/up and placed
them in the window. This drew - many customers
who rode wheels; for he sold these part3 l at lower
prices than the bicycle stores could afford. to do..
All this time he was reading old books and study
ing about machinery, until at last Cruger sent him
to. look at a gasoline launch which he .thought of
buying. Tommy looked it over and was quite .satis
fied with it: but in talking with its owner, he showed
such : a wonderful knowledge
of gasoline engines that: the
man, whose name was >Fort
aer, said: |
"You seem to know all
about these things. -Now, I
aim going to New Zealand to
build -.a big factory" to' make
these engines, and I need a
rood engineer. Will you go
with me ?" .
Mr. Cruger was loath ' to
part -with Tommy, yet .still
he loved him t^o well to pre
vent his advancement, and
he advised him 'to . go with
General Fortrier.^to^New
Zealand for a few years and
learn all about manuf actur-;

increase the accommodations until 150
boys can live and learn and work
t*here, and _to make the output of tha
land cover the outlay for their suste

Rutherford Agricultural College came to
be.
So, easily, off-handedly, he accounted
for the realization of the hobby of tha
kindest heart and wisest head that ever
worked for the welfare of the boy waif.
We were rocking on the front porch of
the cottage at Rutherford Agricultural
College â imposing title that, for all the
gentie, soothing- charms of nature that
rolled sway in a panorama ,*>f pastoral
beauty to the distant hills, for all the
pleasant, homely sights and sounds of
farm, life that all about us appealed to
eye and ear.
The little songbirds twittered and fi ut
tered in Bhnibs and trees, important with
the cares of family life. The liquid note
of the- lark and the cheery call of the
robin alternated.
A fussy mother hen whacked a deli
cious fat grub on the ground \u25a0with her bill
tnd gave the dinner call, and her brood
of chicks, just sprouting tail and wings,
scampered to the meal with their shrill
peep! peepl peep!
A balmy spring zephyr, like velvet to
the cheek, sent pink rose petals drifting
across the grass and wafted to us the
scent of blooming honeysuckle that
clothed the scarred nakedness of tree
stomps.
A staccato announcement from a
chicken-run under the walnut trees . con
veyed the Intelligence that one more ess
had been added to the world's wealth.
A hound stretched - himself lazily
across the gravel path and licked the
hand of a boy in overalls who stopped to
pat himâ a freckle-faced boy with one
suspender and a hat without a band,
grinning widely and happily, a natural,
.bouyant, touzlc-d boy. not a drearily tidy,
suppressed and shrinking "institution"'
boy.
Another boy with a sunburned nose
dashed around the poreh 1 corner in hot
pursuit of a trespassing pig.
A sleek cat rubbed against a porch pil
lar, and then came to me with the con
fidence of a pet used to gentleness.
A^xcss thÂ«* driveway and through the
barnyard swarmed a troop of boys in
overall* and colored shirts and hats in
the various stages of dissolution peculiar
to boy attire, and they swarmed noisily,
playfully, with the curious sidling 'nope"
of the boy when he feels his wellbeing.
They swarmed in the wake of Brother
Paul, a cheerful, sun-browned Xaverian
brother in Khaki, leading them to their
work in the bay field. Some of them broke
from the straggling rank and made a dive
for trowels and rsortar boards and wheel
barrows to do the'r afternoon stunt at
masonry on the new creamery. walL â¢
A lean, weedy boy of grra'-e demean
or â the steady-eyed siort of boy you
can trust with anything â tame out of
the little stone building tliat holds the
Incubators, carefully closing the door
behind him ::r.d carrying in his hand
a panful of chicktn feed. He was on
his way to a chicken run. but lie stop
ped to piclc up a young pigeon and
coddle it in tho hollow of his arm. and
again to put his long arm through a
gateway around the neck of a lame
fawn and press its lovoiy heatl against
his faded blue shirt front.
Nowhere was there an' earmark to
suggest the institution, not even in the
big two-story frame building with its
cupola and cross, which holds the
schoolroom, sitting-room and. dormi
tories. In the second story the win
dows were wide open to let the sweet,
hay-scented air blow through across
the rows of little white iron b^-ds.. and
below in sunny schoolroom arid sit
ting-room were vases of rose* on the
tables and growing roses nodding their
beads at them from without.
Across tho lawn the calves in tho
.meadow* butted each other with.youth
ful exuberance. In a far "field dotted
with noble oaks sleek cattle* browsed
on grass kneo high. From the yellow
ing hay field came the busy "click-click
of the mowers manned '> by ;' pridef ul
boys jealous of their privilege.
It was all natural and simpleâ and
close to the beneficent heart of our
good Mother Nature
.The whole scene and all tho life
spoke of kindness and- plenty and
cheerful industry, and of happy peace.
Any or all of the b<jys fjoing about

>â¢ I for the cobbler to finish a pair of
\u25a0** shoes that should have been done
long before. But cobbler's procrastinate,
especially when a customer Is known to
be good-natured.
Tap! tap! tap! went his hammer.
The sunlight glimmered, uneasily, half
reluctAntly. I thought, through the
smudgy panes. Interrupted by the form
of each passer-by on the pavement"
above, for the cobbler's was the "front
basement" of what had once been a
dwelling houseâ before the overflow of
trade had crept upon the little street and
licked it up.
Tap! tap! tap! 4
Amid the garish disorder of the cob-
bier's bench # amid dismantled footwea I *,
tools. Clings, dust and leather-shavings,
Flood the French heelâ cunningly fash
ioned, covered with the softest kid, pe
tite and chic, incongruously, subtly sug
gestive of feminine grace and charm: of
lingerie, silk hose and a silver-buckled
clipper. Nay, more than this, as my
fancy grewâ of the soft curve of the
ankle and calf they clothed; displayed in
Eerni-consdous naivete and then" with
drawn, hastily, under the jjfaza of a loo
crdent admirer.
A pink-clad maid, I was sure, had stood
upon that heel; a little maid, who would
Jave liked to be tallerâ for the heel was
very highâ and who spent much time in
the selection of footdress, especially if the
salesman happened to be personable and
â¢wore a brown mustache.
Poor little heel! I thought and fell to
musing further. \u0084: \u25a0
It must have been a very proud heel
before it became a castaway. It must
have loved the soft pressure of its mis
tress* foot upon It. It must have trod
eoft tapestries, rich rugs and skimmed
about, with its companion, on glistening
ballroom floors. . ':\u25a0.
It must have, stamped, ofttimes, upon
the ground, , half -Imperiously, half-pet
tishly,. to emphasize displeasure, disap
pointment or chagrin.,, It must have left
delicious memories in the minds of men,
and its imprint on the hearts of more
than one. It must conceal exquisite se
crets. Perhaps, sometimes, it had been
flung at a irald who was careless or at
a disobedient lap-dog. Perhapsâ \u25a0
Tap! tap! tap! wentthe cobbler's" ham
mer. "\iV- v ; -
I picked it "upâ the' "heelâ lightly, ' be
tween my Index-finger and thumb, and'
held It aloft before me, as one', might a
delicate bit of bric-a-brac, a Jewelâ or, in
deed, a glass of wine to let the light'
shine through.'. / : ,V'i"
"Where did you get it?" - 1 asked the
cobbler. ; \u25a0" .' .. ' ; .^
He turned slowly. When he saw what
I held he started, and the dullness went
Â«ut of his eyes. Something like rever
ence came into them and made them
chine.. He was an old, gray man, who
blenfied with the dingy chop like the
cobwebs on the walls, but his eyes could
be expressive.
"That," he said, as if measuring his
words, "that was my daughter's."
He looked out of the window. One could
see nothing through the window but tbe
weather-beaten elde of the stairway that !
led to the street above. But the cob
bler's eyes seemed clairvoyant with mem
ories. The hammer lay forgotten at his
Eide, but his knees still gripped the shoe
he was mending and his posture remained
"unchanged. -
"Will you tell me about It?" I ven
tured, timidly. I wanted to know very
much, but was afraid of trespassing.
For a moment the old, man sat silent
end motionless, like a dusty statue. Then
be epoke, but without turning his head.
"You write stories, don't your* said the
cobbler. "Well, I don't know that I mind
XclUn* you. There's nothln';to hide nowâ
Â«Â»xly I've never told anybody, before.
'/'Maybe" It'll do me, good," he added,
/ausingly, , after a pause. "I've thought
about It all a lot while I've set here
alone, and I don't know why I've never
told- about it. Tes/- maybe it'll do me.
good. \u25a0. â¢"â¢ * \u25a0
"My daughter's dead now," the. cobbler
continued, "but it seems like she was
closer to me than when she was alive
most of the time. She always seemed
better than meâ when she was a child,
evenâ and after Bhe left me I didn't* see
much of * her. !,Her mother wasn't ray
kind, exactly.*' She was a governess be
fore I married her, but she loved me and"
made me a good wife. She might have
been a lady if she'd married the of
some f oiks she worked for ; over in the
old country, but she didn't love the fel
low. Maybe slie wouldn't have been any
happier, if she had, though, than > she
â¢was with me. I ain't a gentleman. but ; I
was good to her and the girl. She had a
taste of the high life anuâ it killed her. ;
"Mary died when the girl. Georgie, was"
14â Just , old enough to take care of-the
house some and'eook. Her mother taught
her that, besides- the manners and other
things that' made her seem : sort Tot
strange to me. ,
"I noticed . she didn't \ like the way I
eat, and it used to make me ort
ableâJust like her mother did some
times, though we was happy enough'to
gether. It wasn't either of their faults;
it was Just the way" they was raised.
"One, day she said, 'Dad, I wish you'd
use ';the fork to put things into your
mouth with.'
"I tried it for a while, because I loved
the child, for all her high and mighti
ness, and wanted to make her happy.
But It was kind of awkwardâ with pota
toes especiallyâ so I dropped back Into
the old way without harÂ«_-y noticln*. â¢\u25a0'...
"Another timeâ on* night it was, when
I was tired and kind of crossâ she said to
me, sort of sharp-likeâ though, maybe, .
she didn't mean it that wayâ" 'I wish
you wouldn't pour your coffee In the
saucer to drink; it ain't nice." h'-.*^
"Well that made me mad, and I said,
'I don't want any more lessons In eti
quette from you. "girl; "do you hear! I'm
eatin' the way my father did before me
and what's good enough for him is good
enough for me.. .
" 'And,' I says, 'if it ain't good enough
for you, you'll have to go somewhere
vjlse." \u25a0>'\u25a0"\u25a0''/': .
"Of course I wouldn't have said that
last If my tongue hadn't give way, for
Georgie and her mother was both mighty
sensitive,: I know it* must have hurt her

"She cleared up the dishes and then

used to read aloud to me.., But I always

make out she was a bad woman because
she'd been on the = stage and was In love
with, this other fellow. I sues* It sort of
crushed : her.' She cried a good deal In
the night and she dldn*t eat much. May
be" the victuals wasn't what she'd got
used to., though Mrs. Smith was a good
cook.
: "I' remembered about the fork and the
coffee, - so" that ' 1 wouldn't vex her any
v more than ," I " could * help, when she had
â¢ all 1 that v : trouble on her mind. One day
'when I wastryin* to get some things to
my- mouth and apinin* them off the fork
she sort 'of smiled a minute and then she
come over and kissed me.
M 'Dear old dad,* she say*. 1 don't
mind about those things any more. Man
ners ain't everything. I've found out
what a lot of scroundrels there Is In the
world, "that's polished on the outside and
dirty as " can be underneath*â and. she
made me eat with the knife agam.
The cobbler stopped, as if musing.
"I'm thlnkln* what a strange thing
fate is." he remarked, "and how differ
ent it all might have ended but for Just
. the way things. had to happen.
"Georgie and the secretary was goin*
to get married." he resumed. "He was a
mighty fine young fellow, and a; gentle
man. - too. Yes. it's God . couldn't
of let it come .out natural and happy
after. all, the trouble they had."
The old man sat with his head bent for
ward, studying a little patch of sunlight
en the dlrt'y floor before him.
"I'm gettin* to the end." he said, "don't
lose patience with me. I was Just think
in* how different it all might have been.
"It was like thi3. The young secretary
fellow happened to go to an outdoor res
-taurantâjust before they was goin* to be
.married.. Georgie. and, him. He'd never
'gone ; there before. It Just happened.
.While he was settln' .there,' eatin' his
dinner. Georgia's husband-that-was, come
"in with three other fellows, 1 all . drunk.
He seen the secretary and pointed to him
and says: 'There's the .damned snake
that broke up my home.' Â« .T*hen ha come
over and raised his cane to hit him. The
secretary took -it away and broke it in
two. Then the society fellow called
Georgia a bad_name and the secretary
x knocked him flat on the grass. \u25a0 He pulled
a gunâ Georgie's husband did-^and tried
to shoot the secretary. w While they was
flghtin' for.it, the gun went oft! and killed
t, the 'fellow.
â¢They had . the secretary arrested and
the men that was with Georgia's hus
band' all swore he did it on purpose.
That got* him' convicted,' for there wasn't
vany one else saw. the shootin* except tha
waiter and I guess -he was ; bribed or
scared.. >
"We tried everything to save the young
fellow. "Georgie- went to "the Governor
herself to ask for a pardon, but it wasn't
any - use. PBB9OQ
- â¢â¢Well, juslbefbre the "last dayâwhen
she was goln'to bid him go*od-by. Georgie
says to me: 'Dad, ' I wish you'd bore ; a
hole in this heel forme big "enough to
hold a piece of lead pencil or something
like that.' I fixed it for her. v I didn't ask
\u25a0her "why. We was all too upset then "to
think about things. She put something*
in â¢ it,* with 'cotton around and then 'she
asked me to cover up the hole so it
wouldn't show^"
â¢They never hung the secretary. Ha
was dead when they went to get him tha
-next morning.'. and . they never found out
how he did it. But Georgie.' she carried
him poison in that heel there and give
it to - him ' some .way ' when â¢ the guard
.wasn't lookln*. She know^jd they'd search
"her before they let her in to see him, but
she fooled them..
\u2666'Maybe I wouldn't have done it if I'd
known- -and maybe I wouldâ but I < didn't
know what \u25a0 she was vp * to- or anything
i about it till " she told me "when she , died.
jShe didn't live long after the secretary.
She died of a broken heart I* ever a wo
r mail did. my Georgie.
"We got' pretty close Â»to each other
\u25a0 them last uays-Hcloser than wo ever was
- before, though she 'was my own child.
â¢ Just : before . she ,*dled one of . the fellows
that saw f the shootin* - confessed he'd
swore a false oath against the secretary.
I ? guess that helped some to break her
heartâ to think it couldn't have happened
a ' little sooner."
\u0084_ The cobbler arose and took the heel
"from" my hands. , He fan" his finger, lov
ingly; over it. Then he] peeled the cdv
'.ering from -the bade and uisclosed a cav
ity large enough to : hold a small vial.
A"; few] flakes of cotton "still "adhered to it.
'Thai a* where . she carried the stuff." "
said the "cobbler. - He set down ; the heel
: ; and ' resumed - his \u25a0â¢. wgrk .on \u25a0â¢ my shoes.

When the French champion came on

. He looked like a" sardine. Not only was
his body dripping; with' oil. but around
his; stomach and "waist were yards of
! red cloth. : Whether, the red cloth was â¢
Intended to represent the British flag or
to. keep him from getting hurt, I didn't
ask.:
that every man in the house,
with .a few exceptions outside of my
; party, \u25a0 expected that ! my opponent would
\ surely stay the four rounds. They -had
two guesses. coming, though, even If a
-bunch of them did^buy a. lot of liquor for
;. me during/ the . day in the hope* that I'd
, be at my worst in the evening. I knocked
my man down three .times ,in the first
round. The third. time he went down he
: stayed down for half an hour, dead to the .
world. He sent for me when '\u25a0\u25a0 he came
\u25a0"* to,*and jn ;the course of ; our conversation
I asked him how It* felt* to r go; to 'sleep so

4 WilI HIM or y Itrp;at for Ciarley
Mitchell?
I am gradually edging toward the Pa
cific Coast, where 1 intend to hold forth
(or some time to come, unless 1 go on to
Alaska. Several pressing invitations have
come to me to go up to the Klondike
country, where juicy purses are to be
hung up by the miners, and if some of
the beefy bruisers will agree to meet
me there the entertainment would be sat
isfactory all around.
At present writing there seems to be a
fair chance that Charley Mitchell will
meet me In a ring on the coast some
where, and If he does and I am able to
catch him I hope to convince him that he
escaped a knockout when we met in
France years ago. This meeting, if . it
comes off. will make a good' many people
think 'that the clocks are going back
ward. Here's a brief report of the fight
between myself and Mitchell, written by
one of the fairest men that ever lived,.
John Boyle O'Reilly, In a book he print
ed soon after the battle.
"The men fought near ChantiUy. France,
on March 10, 1SSS, for Â£500 and the chain- Â°
ploashlp of the world. The rules were
those of the London prize ring, and
these . rules enabled the Inferior man to
escape. -and might easily have made him
the victor. The fight lasted three hours
and eleven minutes, in which time thirty
nine regular rounds and four or five ir
regular rounds were fought. After five
or . six rounds, during which he was
knocked down literally every time he
stood up/ Mitchell adopted a sj-Etem of
running away and falling to escape
blows. A cold rain was falling on the
fighters and Sullivan became chilled, and
in the thirty -fifth round Sullivan had a
fit of the ague. He was overtrained :, ne
had ' hurt his right hand ; he was too
heavy to plough through the mud after
his running adversary, whom he could not
catch; so he agreed to end the contest
as a draw."
If Charley can't run as well -now as he
could then you can guees where he'll get
off at when I get him again at arm's
length.

i O ne-Eyed "> Connolly and the - Evil ' Eye. '
A man tollma not long ago .that: he
thought I had been under the influence
of the '.'evil eye", since the time I made
a kick at "One-Eyed"; Connolly. Alot

under: the sun, for ' everybody knows

"One-Eyed" Connolly was an old
time fighter who had gone by, but ; he*
managed to .attend all the big fights:
in air parts of the country by jumping
freights instead o.f taking Pullmans...
When I fought Burke, Connolly was.
one of his seconds and r ;. before the
fight "One-Eyed" came to me to apolo

"One-Eyed" Connolly was for years aW
most as much of an attraction at the big
fights as the fighters.' He ; managed to . ;
make wonderful Jumps across the conti

my. share, but I haven't learned to
drink that way and I never will." * -I
took Glllespie by the collar, which I had
held all the while, and we got " out be
fore murder was done us.
Some of my party thought I had dona
a very impolite thing, especially after
we had been shown over a British war
ship, and had other attentions, but I
thought the whole thing a dodge by
that sawed-off Mayor to do me oaa
way if he couldn't another. '
Meets the Governor* of North and
V South Carolina.
â¢ Some years ago, -while on my way 'â¢
South, I met up with a lot of Confed
erate veterans at a railroad station* in
South Carolina. They were returning
home from a reunion, and a big bunch
of them got around me on the platform
to sco -what I looked like.
"We've seen Yankee* fighters down
here before \ and although they j wera
good fighters, we weren't . as ; glad to
.see them as. we. are to see you," one
tall scrapper of the gray said to me.
"I'm sorry that my style of fighting
wasn't the only kind that was done be
tween the North. and the South." I an
swered.
"It would shore have been healthier
all "round."* he replied.
As we were swapping chaff the
crowd opened to let in two fine looking
gentlemen. They were made, known to
me as -the. Governor of North Carolina
and the Governor of South Carolina.
They said some mighty nice things and
gave me a hearty welcome to their part
of the country.

\u25ba â¢*-* â¢* 3EN I returned to Boston
\ A J frcm my tour of England a
V tug loaded with friends met .
Â« the steamer down the bay.
There was a banquet at one of the hotels
tV.at night and more than !30 sports paid
$10 each to get their legs under the table.
Some of my friends wept with joy when
I landed from the steamer.
Sbme Joker tried to >poil the reception.
He sent a bogus cablegram to one of the
le'kders^of the party just before the tug
started down the harbor. The bogus ; tel
egram read something like this: . '"''

with being in a plot to blow up the ,

what he thought would be a wild goose.-,

a paper in Boston, and the, paper got

It never got out, though, as I landed on

discouragements of farm life "I don't
believe in too early rising, especially for
growing boys, and the rising hour here is

"Its all right," said Gatwick affably.
"You see. I thought you" might be the

It's best to be non-committal.**
Jessie Wfllard langrbed merrily: "You

"That's awfully cheap." she agreed,
"and I'm glad I found you."
"Then." he countered, "I shall be well

She looked suggestively toward the
barn. It occurred to her that this trav

miliar on short . acquaintance. Gat
wick took the hint and started the
bony beast. Twenty minutes later he
again approached his employer.

said Ehortly, and they started across the

chatting as old friends.

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY. CALL.
IN the neighborhood there lived a

Recently, he went to the city to un

the old men who had never been away

agreed that he must be honest. All rich

must be industrious, for of itself In
dustry was raid. If he could not find a
job at good pay, take one at poor pay.:
It was better to work for nothing than
to be Idle, Sam inquired of old Limuel
If be had nothing to offer.
"Well, yes." said the" old man. "but
I'll give you my advice after you get
back home."*
A few weeks later Sam returned. He
had just come out of a hospital. Hla
head was bandaged and he walked with
a limp. Old Limuel was among- the
neighbors that called on him. "The city
didn't appear to agree with you," said
he. "How did all this happen?"

"Couldn't you get work?" Brlziatine

Next mornin* I went out to find
York. I met a well-dressed feller and he
sorter looked at me and then asked me
Si I wanted a job. I tcld him he was my
friend. He asked me If I could drive a
wagoc. and I told him I looked on a
horse as 1 did a pie when I was hungry
for sweet stuff. He said 'follow me,* arid
I followed him. We came to a big store
and there was a crowd about it and I
thought this feller must be doin* a whal
in' business. He showed me the wagon
he wanted driv*. Two horses were hitch
ed to It, and I says to 'esi.'boys. your
master has ariW One of the horses
looked at me and sorter grinned, I
thought. The other one didn't say noth
in*. Â« Wtll. another feller got on the wag
en to tell me where to gt>, he 'lowed. And
then I took up the lines and drlv* off. I
had heard what a hard time some folks
had struck grettin' work, and I thought it
was comin* easy for me. I hadn't asked
the boss what be was goin* to pay. He
fa.id he'd make it all right with me, and
that seemed fair enough. Well. I hadn't
driv* more than a hundred yards when
some fellers ran out from some place I
didn't know where and yelled 'scab.* I
says that's all right, fellers, but I ain't
sore- One of 'cm Eild I would be the first
thing I knowed. By this time the feller
that started out with me had goneâ and
the next minute here came bricks and
pieces of iron. I said *quit that, ypu might"
hurt somebody.' I was used to playin*.
but that looked sorter rough to me. But
they kept on. 'Quit.* I -says, *you might
hit me,' and about that time oH the wag
on I went, with a brickbat bounctn" from
my head. Then here come the fellers.
They wallowed me. they beat meâ end
when I come to I was in what they call
a hospital. That's all there was to it-
There was a strike."
"And it was a shame to beat my son,"
said the mother. "What right had- they
to act ; lhat way? I should like to. know^
what sort of mothers they, bad." '~ She j;
saw 'another pain coming and . got vp \xo :._.

The old woman rushed at him with a

"Secession was a hard thing to.set-"

play compared with the labor question." v
"I don't see why it ought to be so '
hard," Briz spoke up. "If you don't ;

you've got to do is. to .tell him so." ;-.::
"Yes, it might appear that way, but it
ain't," Llm replied. "This thing of "In

Mr. Skinner of the. Shreve-Barber Com
pany Is ,the Inventor, of "this unique cos
tume.: which really all the re
. quirements.; ;-When ussd as a walking \u25a0
. su't It is . so made as to button over and
fasten on. each side. ; and consequently no
division can be seen. There are two Illus
trations of this costume shown. In one
of them lt_is buttoned over, for tramping,
closed It might perhaps be called, and in
1 the other, ; or: open*, one, .the flap is not
buttoned over, but turned ' and buttoned
back," ready for riding. This coat is very,
-jaunty," either ; over ,' or - turned
back.. "Oncof .the great attractions .of
; thlB\ costume., especially; when '.\u25a0 worn for
- riding,, is > the - - Vputtee . leggings" that
should forma part of it. ..These" are prac
tically. ;thej same "as i the \ riding
worn 'by -men.* but Mr/ '< Skinner has re
cently Imported them from ; England" in
'women's sizes. They add -Immensely to
the smartness of the ? costume, and at
the" same time 'they add ' greatly , to one's
comfort. Gauntlets "ought also to be
-worn, land; they can be' found In several
different ; styles, and . in all colors. White
gauntlets; stitched in red, .with what i 3
:. callcd'the "cowboy \ fringe." are very at
tractive-tnJ present rather a -sporty ap
pearance. :A very good riding hat is the
small as .it shades the eyes
from.the sur. and stays on the head well.
The whip should .. "of . course be the Eng
lish \u0084 riding ' crop.
We 'are gradually becoming accustomed
to seeing, women -rlae man-fashion, -even
in the, park and In I the streets, ami for
v rough riding [ there ,1s no doubt
' that rlt is much safer. In fact. , I think :
that r bn- such occasions it is almost.uni
versally \u25a0 adopted. " *For -- this : purpose the
plain s divided skirt;;which opens straight
down the back and the front," but button
ing over inlfront about, six. inches,: must
be worn. When standing this skirt falls
\u25a0down gracefully together. -With this cos
tumeone should adopt the modern Rus
>"' sian riding-boot, which. 13 made of black
leather and - reaches - about six Inches
above the knee. It Is laced ' up the side
{-r^HJS is the season of the year
} when all of us bc^iu to think of
I vacations and of all possible out
\ ins*-', cither mountains, with rid
~ -ing r&rtias and hill climbing, or
j-ck shore, r/ltb bathing by day and
chancing; by night. Whether we go to
a fashionable hotel or to an ordinary
country resort, or even :f we are out
camping, some preparation must be
made in the matter of dress. No girl
wh# is good for anything will neglect
this subject. We must be appropriate
ly and, of course, becomingly dressed,
or our pleasure will be marred and our
opportunities? wasted. Every San Fran
cisco girl will appreciate the fact that
it would be a tremendous pity to lose
any of * the benefits and pleasures of
a summer's vacation or of a transient
outing. In California camping is not
' lly a pleasure, but the absolute se
curity from rain and bad weauicr make
this an ideal country for that kind of
â¢utlng. With an agreeable party; and
\u25a0with a proper outfit of garments, camp
ing out is great fun. An old and ex
perienced camr>er will of course know
just what kind of clothes it is neces
sary to start out with, but the Inex
perienced may be glad to learn -what it
is desirable to provide. The right kind
<rf dress must, of course, be modest
and comfortable and at the same t'me
it must be strong and serviceable and
able to stand the wear and tear of
woods and bills and bushes and dusty
roads. It is not easy to find exactly
the right material for such a dress, but
at last I think I have acquired some
ideas about it. "We have to make our
acknowledgments to the Sierra Club.
It is not a matter of news that this
club arranges every year for some new
and difficult camping and tramping
expedition, along neglected trails, up
high mountains and over dangerous
places, one year through the Kings
Ttiver Canyon, another year in the Yo
semltc Valley and again, perhaps, in
the region of Mount Shasta. There are
3, great many ladies in the club, ready,
\u25a0willing and able to keep up with the
procession and do their full share of
climbing and walking, but unless they
have appropriate costumes they could
not hope to achieve results. Daintiness
is not a requisite â that idea must be
put aside or left at home agalnEt a re
turn to regions of civilization and so
ciety. The best material for this sort
; of outing is khaki, which is wonder
ful stuff to wear. The color is pretty,
a sort of light olive green, and it does
Siot tear or fade or crumple. Besides
that, it is light and cool and does not
absorb or show the dust. There are,
however, different grades &nd shade?
of khaki, as you may notice among the
soldiers who have returned from the
Philippines â the officers wearing a fin
er grade and a different color from thÂ«
rank and file. I think that the smart
est khaki for a walking suit is the
Bedford corduroy, which has a little
more body to it than the ordinary
khaki, though probably its only or at
least its chief advantage is its smart
ness.
In the illustration which shows a fishing
co&lume. there Is an example of what
*>eems to me to be cne of the
b,cst *I * have seen. Old and ex
perienced campers will no doubt rec
ognize this style of dress, but beginners .
may wonder at the peculiar arrange
ment of it. It is of khaki, of course,
and the skirt is the remarkable itart of
it. This skirt when hanging straight
down reaches above the boots. In fact
about half way between the ankle and
the knee. It is provided with cords or
halliards, running down the seams
from the belt to the bottom of the
skirt, which can be pulled in whenever
necessary, raising the skirt to any de-
sired height. But your rubber boots,
\u25a0which reach nearly to the thigh, are
your protection, and they, will enable
you to -wade iv any stream where you
may wish to tempt the wary trout. A
good rod, with a tempting. fly or the
end of the line, a fish basket over your
snbulder, and you are equipped for, your
little fishing expedition. The" result
should be a few fresh and delicious
trout for the campers' evening meal." ..
The pulling up of the skirt does not
by any means imply an .'awkward, and
hunchy appearance, but It is so deftly
and skillfully made that It still has a
pood appearance and there is always a
g-od "hang to it." Knickerbockers': or
leggins should be worn under ' this
skirl. These are not a bit like
â¢â¢bloomers," but arc made in a good
shape, fitting- nicely, and buttoning:
snugly just below the knee on a "knee
cuff." .very much like the riding,,leg
gins that are worn by men. The, high
rubber boots are put ori over the
knickerbockers and are held up by two
straps. that button at the waist.
The jacket of this suit Is made H to fit
across the bust arid is loose at the waist.
In something of the style of the Norfolk
jacket, except that It . Is quite - short,
reaching \ barely below, the waist line.
Add to this a smart little cap, matching
the suit and fitting the head so that it
of the leg- and fits snugly -to It, but It
can be turned over at the top, making ft
very stylish cuff at the knees. The illu*.
tration shows it laced to Its full height.
â¢In these modern days it. Is not at all
unusual for women to accompany thel?
husbands or brothers on shooting Off
hunting expeditions, and - a special. coÂ»~
turns is necessary for these occasions.
There must be perfect freedom of body,
the arms must not ue constrained la any
way, and generally the . costume must bÂ»
ausolutely loose. If the arms are la any
way constrained one's aim is slow and
far from. sure, and the hunter is very,
soon fatigued and falls out of the game.
One of the illustrations shows a.combina
tion jersey and sweater, which may bÂ«
worn- with or without corsets, but pref
erably without them. It Is open at ,thÂ»
neck, with a Byron collar and laces down
in front about four inches. A loose flow-
Ing tie may be worn with it for decor
ative purposes. The skirt may, be the
conventional short walking skirt of kha
ki or denim. The best style of boot for
this costume Is the white elkskln boot,
reaching to the knee. Although this ma
terial id quite soft and comfortable, yet
long tramps do frequently cause so
much trouble with the feet as to spoil
"one's pleasure and possibly to compel one 1
to give up many delightful walks and ex
cursions."; . And here I venture to give a
simple prescription that I have tried with
good results. A small tin of .mutton' ta!-'
low will be a very J desirable thing to add
to the equipment before starting on a
tramp, and . as soon as the shoe begins to
rub or blister any part of the foot tha
tallow should be applied to that spot im
mediately. Turn the stocking wrong side
out before replacing It. .with a little" tal
low on that part of it tnat touches thÂ»
sore ispbt. and the effect be found
to be soothing 1 and , healing 1 .
"With" all these different and appropriate,
costumes - there are many little accesso
ries which add to one's comfort or con
venience. For example, for hill climbing
the alpenstock, for fishing the fish bas
ket and bait box, for shooting. *he car
tridge ; bel* and game bag, and for all
kinds of outdoor excursions the knapsack
and the canteen.
Mr. Skinner has made a thoughtful
study of all these minor appointments
which serve to make camping and tramp
ing and their accompanying sports. easy
and comfortable. - One more important
consideration Is the provision for steeps
ing. For this < purpose a sleeping bag Is
ths best thing to have. It Is easily rolled
and packed, besides being capable lot >
holding " things, and ' it makes an excel
lent, warm and comfortable bed. No>
tent is necessaryâ and no rain need ba
provided : fcr during our summer months.
It Is : ; no wonder that every year' ths
numberof camping parties increases. '
Â« I hope that I have been able to make
some : suggestions here that may prove
to be useful and timely. If so, I . shall
be very glad, for I know from my own
experience that it sometimes happens
that a trip or an outing that Is looked
forward to with pleasurable , anticipation
may be marred by inadequate prepara
tion or incomplete equipment.

engineers laughing over the .rcj> â \u25a0 that
somebody had Invented a thing that
woulfi feed tallow automatically drop
by drop against steam pressure. I guess
it's on a par with that automatic air
brake. What I meant was this. I ex
pect we will go into Harrlsburg on the
pilot -of, No. 3 to-night if she is a cab
oiler.- That will avoid a grimy smoke
artist falling over, us the first hill we
etart down.**
"You surely don't intend to ride the
cow-catcher!" gasped John. ! :Â«'! :
Tes," answered Howe, "and see here,
' John. The railroad man calls that piece
of furniture a pilot. Don't forget it. It
might get the firm into trouble. Now
the plan is this: We will stroll up to
that station, get there a few minutes
before the train Is due. If the platform.
is on the engineer's side, and Â£ho is our
kind of oiler we are O. K. We stand
close to the track on the left side. When
she ttops the fireman will do one of
two things. Either be working on - his
' fire to get it \in good shape to stand
the heavy mauling of starting and re
paining epeed or will cross to the en
gineer's side to inspect the feminine pop
ulation. It is immaterial to which .his
temperament leads him. It will leave a
clear coast for us to climb on. Once
there under the headlight, it's the dark
est, slickest place to 'beat' oh the train."
"But cattle," eaid John.
"Never mind about mights or mays."
Interrupted Howe quickly. "If you -let
them paddle around in your gray matter
> ou ; will prove a disgrace . to your de
voted teacher."
John brought a, heavy .hand down on
his shoulder, and arising the laughing
couple cet out for "their kind" of a sta
tion; : â¢ >^~
When after an hour they reached It, It
happily' came up to expectations; a long
reach' of. boards en the right side. s - a
clump. cf carefully tended flowers nestled
in the dark green lawn on the left. Avoid
ing the^boye and men decorating the rail
ing arid trucks they strolled to the upper
end. It was a dark moonless night "Just
right." John commented.
Down the lino sounded the - musical
chime of a whistle. ..... .... . -T
"Cross over,* said Howe.-
Gray followed, his heart beating rather
Quicker taan he liked. They had gauged.
J~r OHN GRAY though* as he looked
I upon fhe swift flow of the strag
1 gling landscape of the change. that
QJ had come in* his life.
"Well," said Howe, "we . are - really
started. Now, when we gÂ«t to Baltimore*
it will be no use to try to get out of .
there in a coach. I'll have to try.. a, new
racket. It's one I've thought out "and I i
know it will work."
"All right," said Gray. "You are the
captain."
It seemed only a few minutes to John
when, after a confused mixture of -
Druidic groves, quick-angling country
country homes, they ran into a maze of
sidetracks through a long, sulphurous
tunnel, to emerge under a smoky train
shed resonant with clanging bells and
rusTHng feet.
"Come on," said Howe, passing Into -
the station. He crossed to the ticket
window and from a tin case extracted a
long slip of cardboard.
"Our compass," , he remarked with a
l^ugh. "Let's go to some quiet place and
map cut our campaign."
In a corner they found a pile of boards.
Howe took out his "compass."
"Now, this is what is called a passen
ger time card," he remarked. "The true
time card Is called the working cardV It
contains the arriving and leaving time
of all regular trainsâ both freight and
passengerâ at all stations; this Is a non
offlcial imitation used by the passenger
department for the benefit of the travel
ing public. Of course, it's correct as far
as passengrer trains go. but some smart
Alecks think It is the real thing. There
is a great difference in the big sheet car
rying on its face all of the regular trains
passing over a division. Strings of black.
*naky figures that, cobra-like, bite swift
and deep when you ignore" or disregard
them. But you will absorb that soon
enough. Now. what I want of this card
is this": You see here," placing his finger
at the bottom, "is a train No. 3, leaving
here "at 8 :01 p. m. Now, follow upâ
where time is shown opposite station
names the train makes a stopâ you see
this row is filled to Harrlsburgâ that
means the train is a local accommoda
tion, stopping at all stations. Now, see,
ehe etops here at 8:23 â If the "engine is an
inside oiler we are O. K."
"What do you mean by an inside oil
er?" asked Gray.
"Why, this. The valves that admit
Fteam to the cylinders are moving across
their seats continually when the engine
is In motion, and, of course, the pistons
in the cylinders, too. There is lots of
friction, and they must get oil. Until
very lately the only way to do this
was to take a pot of melted tallow and
pour it into cups placed upon the steam
chestsâ a dangerous piece of business
that has put many a poor fireman under
the daisies. You pitch -over a grade,
wind . blowing a gale, air full of sleet,
rucniog board a. sheet of ice, your eyes
full of fireâ the dared blind of the white
hot furnace that you have been punch
ing and slashing for an hourâ and start
tmh a gallon of hot tallow and your
lantern in one hand clinging to* the
hand-rail with the other. Then step
down on the hot steam chest, balance
yourselfâ kick the cop openâ pour In the
precious grease â then clutching the
headlight bracketâ step over the black
gru.f <to the pilot beam, work your way
over the pitching, plunging front to re
peat the process on the other side, know
ing that at any moment you may form
& cushion against the . smoke box for
the accommodation of a prowling cow
âit forms a bad combination.
it well, the-pilot stopped nearly opposite
them. ' â¢ . . - . '. \u25a0
"Crawl up. take} your time; that's; It
Now catch your heels^in the cross bars,"
commanded Howe as they, quickiy clam
bered up. . â¢
"Now we -are 'It.'" he exclaimed as
they settled on v the pilot beam. v.ome
on old smoke wajjon."
As if in answer to the taunt a hoarse
roar .tore through the smoke .box. the
air was filled with the fiery' uprising of
red , cinders, the beam * swung from side
to side over a heavy "clip" of th'e'grlnd
ing drivers. John clung 'ta t his.beamâde
spite its swing it seemed refreshingly
solid. Then silence for a 'second, then
with a heavy exhaust they. were off.
"I wish I had that idiot by "the neck,"
howled Howe nearly standing on his head
in a frantic effort to dislodge a "hot one' 1
from under his collar. !
"Never drop sand at a 6top. , Ihey rip
an engine wide' open. I was his
master mechanicâ scare you,: John?"
"I decline to answer questions coming
from a man in your mental. Condition/
responded John dryly.' ' .
"AH rJsh't, young man, just wait until
you get a pound of red hot flre down
your back and then- Ill do the Ben
Franklin act.'.' I .
Meanwhile the train had gathered head
way. To John â¢it was very strange, very
awesome, yet delightfully fascinatingâ
the divergent rays of the headlight glow
ing in quick broken ripples against "ghost
ly cuts, darting amid the swaying fes
toons of reeling brjdges, or mirrored mo
mentarily, like a free, swift-living bird,
in the sudden outflashing of cottage win
dowsâthe unsprlnglng into spectral prom
inence and fleeting-flight Into the night of
all things. The heavy bound from 1 the
curve to tangentâ the grinding backward,
return; the sense of a mighty, irresisti
ble power; rioting In thrust of piston or
grim dance of rods; the meteor flight of
lighted hamlets, their lights streaming
back like stripes on a wide-flung banner,
and over all tbe sheet of Hying flre, punc
tuated by the hoarse tear of the eager,
crowding exhaust*.
"Hew do' you like it?" asked Howe.
â¢Tin just beginning to live,": came the
answer. Howe noticed the vibrant ring
in the voice and clasped the. hand rest-
Ing near his, approvingly.
A long whistle^ then the clatter of
valves, replaced the tumult of rushing
steam.
"Won't" the people at the station .see
us?" ' . - â¢;.-; -;." ;
"No, indeed; this is the 'darkest place
on the train.- Haven't you ever noticed
hew people* will stare at the headlight
until it Is on them and then drop their;
blinded eyes while the engine passes?
Watch now!" t and John saw he was
right. .
"Our only trouble will be- at York;
where the ( cinder throwing . high, priest,
will probably . anoint the combination.
There is a coal bin a little way, this /side*:
but we will be- safe thereâ too much
coal scattered on" the ground for the oil
artist. Now, when we get. to York we
will watch which side he gets down on,
crawl upon the running board on the/op
posite eld?; crouch down, and when be
gets through and is getting up with the
torch flare in his eyes we will regain^ our
places. N^> danger of the fireman seeing
us; it only takes about four minutes to
get water."
Howe proved a good prophet. At York
things worked like> clockwork. Dodging
the burly old engineer proved an easy
task. The strong face, torch Illumined,
peering for oil .holes, passing unsuspect
ing a foot j from his own, gave John a
great Inclination to laugh aloud. %<.;
Then they came upon a long; silver
line with -misty oval emeralds oh its
bosom. \u25a0
"That's the , Susquehanna," '.; said
Howe. "We. will soon be âin Harris
burg. It's "a rough place on, people in
our peculiar line, so. as soon as we
stop, dodge â¢ oflNand run back on / the
track side; then- we can cross over, the
coach platform and join' the passengers
as they get off.**
This, too, worked all right. As -the
engine stopped v they dropped quickly
to the ground. Only .a, car Inspector
noticed them. "Laughing as* he ! ob-*"
served their move he muttered. "Rather
a slick pair; beat old John -all right."
. After a few minutes in a lunch room
they made , a detour to the . freight
yards, where they came to a great en
gine house, v On an outgoing track
stood a long row of simmering ma
chines; standing with banked fires
awaiting their turn to leap into stren
uous life. ' The stack emitting now
only a faint shadowy ; wisp of ."vapor
soon to wave a sable : plumeâ red
woofed In threaded .flre 'over the stars
glimmering In- the long; stretches- of
the "Blue Juanlta" or "Lordly Susque
hanna.'' t,< ' -. - â¢ .- â¢ - "â¢' \u25a0'\u25a0 \u25a0
"Now these, are engines soon; to â go
out," said Howe as â¢ they rested upon
the edge of a friendly truck. "They,
are all freights, but there comes the
one ,we rode "here on. This winds \up
her trip. Now the'.englneer leaves her
and the house gang .takes, her 1 In

much of it. and was not at all disposed
to part with it freely. Mr. Smith" did
nothing to*disabuse their minds of this
Impression. He seemed to care little
for the old place and was seldom seen
there. But" since -he has had as* his
guests his sister. Mrs. Cooper, and her

gone a change regarding the extent of
his resources and munificence. He Is

LONDON. June 3. â King Edward and
the Emperor'of Germany are generally
Eupposed to carry off the palm among
royalty for fine horses, but few people
knoxr the extent of the stables' of the
King of Belgium. There are now at
least two hundred steeds there. Six
teen of them are saddle horses -id all
thoroughbreds, especially imported by
his Majesty, either from England or
Limoges- A few years ago a gray mare
from Berlin was added to the number,
for which JTSOO was paid, but she was
quickly discarded The carriage horses
are half-bred En^ish-Norman, sturdy
and well and strongly built.
King Leopold is himself a very fine
horseman, and. unlike many of his
brother monarchs. he disdains to mount
a horse which has alrady been ' spe
cially ridden and fatigued beforehand
Hardly will he allow his mount to be
exercised the previous day. so much
does he love to feel the animal in full
spirits. Last year at Ostcnd he was
often to be seen riding a beautiful
black horse, his latest favorite, called
Gentllle (pretty). He boasts that,
though a fearless rider, he has never
had a'ttJl-. He isso tall that' his sad

ROME, June 3.â What is almost its
last act has just been played in one of;
the most pathetk- dramas In real life on^
record in this country. It has been a par-" j
liameaiary drama, the chief" players, with ]
two exceptions, having been members of
the Italian Chamber of Deputies, -while
the Chamber itself has been the theater
in which most of the action has taken
place.
For the beginning of this drama one
must go back seven years. At that time
the Italian Chamber of Deputies was en
livened by the wit and fighting qualities
of two bitter antagonists/ Felice Caval
lottt. the Radical leader, and Count Fer
ruccio Macola. the brilliant Conservative
Deputy. Cavallotti. besides being one of
the most striking figures in Parliament,
\u25a0was an eloquent writer, a dramatist of
some distinction and a famous duelist.
Hot tempered and impulsive, he .was the
Idol ef the Italian Radicals.
His great rival. Count Ferruccio Ma
cola. was the antithesis of Cavallotti In
nearly every respect except that of being
a born fighter, violent and dogged. . For
many months the men had opposed each
other in debate of the blttrest descrip
tion and the adherents of both dreaded
the day when they should come ; to an
open rupture. Tfcat day came in the early
part of March. IS9S. The subject of their
quarrel was an absolutely technical - one
from which the personal element was
quite absent, but heated language was
used on both sides, and it was prac
tically certain that serious ; conse
quences would follow. The friends of
both men,- however, did all In their
power to smooth the affair over, and It
was generally supposed that they had
i been' successful, when all Rome was :
' startled by hearing . that there was to
be a duel between the two Deputies.
MACOLA SUAA'S HIS FOE.
The combat was precipitated by Caval
lotti, who. though he was then SS. | over
fat and extremely \u25a0 short-sighted, .was de
termined to fight. The Radical leader al
ready had fought thirty-five duels ; and
had "come off. .practically unscathed. â¢ and
regarded himself as Jnvincible. \u25a0 v

-Count Macola, on' the,other hand; had
no wish .to meet his rival, although he
had no special reason . to fear the issues
for he was not only Cavallotti's .equal
as- a" swordsman but had the advantage
of. him in years, being only thirty
seven. Macola also had many success
ful duels to. bis credit. He did all in
hi s power to avoid ; the encounter, but
it was forced upon" him- ,
The scene of the duel, was a villa not
far outside the Maggiore Gate of Rome,
belonging to the famous Countess Cel
lere. This noblewoman had , been a
gTeat beauty. and the more or ? less in
timate friend of all the latter-aa* sreat
men of Italy. Her friendship .' -trith
Ca\-allotti was said at one time to have

a determination on Macola's part to llv%
down his remorse and fight his ene
mies. But the strain was too great.
Nature stepped in. and from that day
theVCount.had not only to contend wita
pitiless human antagonists, but with
physical .weakness. This unequal con
test lasted for nearly seven years, which,
for Macola have been years of weari
ness, illness ' and discouragementâ with
occasional flashes of his old brilliancy
and wit. love of controversy and Joy in

SEVEREST BLOW DEALT.
What -the public believes to be almost
the last scene in the tragedy was enact
ed - the other day. and those who wit
nessed it declare that the memory wCI
never pass from their minds. For many
months .Count Macola had not attended
Parliament. ' His spirits .. had somewhat
improved? in the interval, and as a new
Chamber, was -to meet, the much -tried
Conservative deputy fancied that ha
might be allowed to speak without mo-.
lestatlon. He hoped that seven years
v would have been sufficient to placate his
opponents. So, after writing one of thÂ©
most' brilliant speeches ever prepared by
him,: Macola went down to the Chamber
to "deliver it. Â«
As he rose, notes in hand, to begin his
address a hush of expectation fell on the
House, and .for a moment it appeared
that' the Conservative leader was not to
be interfered with. Then, without a word. '
the entire Extreme Left rose and left. the
hall in a body without a glance at the
speaker. â¢ Macola tamed pale, but did not
lose his self-possession, and glancing at
his notes began his speech. Buddenly.
however, he stopped, hesitated, consulted
bis notes and then went on. Again he
stopped. looked about him In a dazed
manner, said a few words, trembling
violently. , but making a supreme eÂ£ort-
It was futile, however, and after saying
in a smothered voice. ~I cannot: I feel
ill!" Macola almost sank to the floor. :
A few moments later, assisted by his
friends, the Count left the Chamber.
while those .who â¢ remained heard sup
pressed \u25a0 sobs from the ladles' gallery, as
the Countess Macola hurried to join and
comfort -her husband. It Is feared that
he win never, recover, from this. laÂ»t
blow. .Â«6ffi6!HHfiPSPw^MKS|SI

paper statement is the more extensively
it Is read and the more . authentic it is
regarded. No, I will spend the vacation

Hampton, Long Islar.a."
We talked about the Drews and the
Barrymores of the. present. Mr. Drew's
daughter. Louise, has been much praised
by the Boston critics for her Ingenue
work in Robert Edeson'e "Strongheart,"
and her father noted the fact with pater
nal pride. She was herewith him three
years ago, when he appeared In "The Sec
ond in Command," and . her , social tri
umphs were hardly less. pronounced than
those subsequently . achieved by her
cousin, Ethel Barrymore, who is now en
route to Europe on the Kaiser .Wit
helm 11.
"Ethel's health is very much improved,"
Mr. Drew said, "and she will return In
about a montn and spend the remainder
of her rest period at my home. The
steamer which took her out went agTvund
near Sandy Hook and remained there half
a day and Ethel sent me a dispatch to
allay any anxiety that might have been
caused by exaggerated reports of the ac
cident." - â¢
"Her brother Lionelâ he, . too, was re
ported very seriously 111?"
"That story also was exaggerated in the
printing," said Mr. Drew. "Lionel indis
creetly resumed work before he had suf
ficiently recovered from- an- attack- of
pneumonia, but rest is making him quite
fit for next season. His brother Jack is
In London with Collier in 'The Dictator,'
and the press has complimented him."
Mr. Drew's' attention was called to a
newspaper statement to the effect that
the tesmisters' * strike In Chicago was
"hurting the theaters," and he said if
any theater was 'hurt' the cause of the
lnjury'.was probably something else.
"It Is silly," he said, "to ascribe failing
business to any cause other than the real
oneâ lack of attractiveness. In Chicago,
as everywhere else, nothing less danger
ous than actual state of riot would keep
people away from a playhouse that is
presenting something they want to see.
That Chicago story reminds me "of \u25a0; the
London manager who declared that his
business was hurt by bridge whist." \ *
And of the mooted tendency of the the
ater he had pretty much the same thing
to sayâ the attractiveness of the stage
offering regulates the public taste. '
"If you give good tragedy interpreted
by a good tragedian, people will .go to
see it," he said, "and so It is with comedy
or opera or any other kind of stage pro
duction. But when you present ' mediocre
If any actor ot..er than John Drew had
said he was satisfied with the world's
treatment of himself. I would have sus
pected him of harboring intent to deceive.
But there really was no reason to ques
tion tuch a statement from the most feted
and flattered and securely established
on the American stage. Surely, I
nought, if this man cannot afford to
eschew the jealousies and other causes
cf heartburn notoriously characteristic of
the mummer, then there can be no at
tainment of content in his profession.
We were discussing Mr. Drew's recent
election io the presicency of the Players'
t'.'ub when he inadvertently exposed his
mindcase.
â¢To me no mark of distinction could
have been mere acceptable," he said.
"Accession to the chair filled successively
by Booth and Jefferson is, in my opinion,
the greatest honor ihat could be extended
to an American actor. And I relish it all
the more t perhaps, because of my age as
compared' with that cf . either of my il
lustriouE predecessors. Such compliments
usually co:re when life's activity is wan
ing."
1 gues?ed his age at 45 years or close
thereto, and he laugned and said it was
nearer 50.
"In horisey parlance. I'm rising 50 and
sound in wind and limb. And I'm fortu
nate, as you see, in retention of hair and
exclusion from overstcutness of figure.
The fatness that is akin to fatality in our
profession has considerately Ignored me."
â¢Athletics?" I inauired.
"Tes, to some extent; but I don't go In
for them as a regular thing. Heredity, I
think, has much to do with my escape
from bcth baldness and corpulence. I
come of lean stock and have never found
â¢physical torture' necescary to the pres
ervation cf my form. And to keep the
hair en and superfluous flesh off is the
chief end of the actor."
Then wo took up Ibsen and Bernard
Shaw, between whose methods of play
writing Mr. Drew apparently perceived
an affinity, and from them we wandered
in some mysterious roundabout way to
Ycung Coroett and Eddie Hanlon. whose
combat, then pending. Mr. Drew an
nounced his Intention to witness if he
could possibly do so without neglecting
his own production of public entertain
ment.
"Shew > like Ibsen, is not readily under
standable," he said, "aÂ«d his plays to be
comprehensively enjoyed should be stu
diously perused beforehand. Unless one
is Ibsenized by reading, you know, one
cannot fully relish at first sitting even
the most unsubUe of Ibsen's dramas.
"Well, so it is with the Irish-Englishman.
His 'Candida.' however, paved the way
for American appreciation of his 'You
Never Can Tell.' and now it may be said
without fear of future contradiction that
the Shaw plays have come to the front
end to stay.**
Then. siJil harping on plays. Mr. Drew
opined that the success or failure of any
play rests upon the manner of its pro
duction. In other words â though he de
clined to put it so broadlyâ the players
art greater than the playwright.
"It is, the fame of the actors, rather
than the vehicles of their introduction,
that attract the American people," he
eaid. "Of course no reputable manager
or actor will use a poor vehicle If he can
procure a good one, and it Is appreciation
of that very fact that leads the people
to measure in advance the quality of a
play by the standing of the manager who
produces it or the actors who interpret it.
Isn't it better to read a good play than
to EÂ»t it badly played? Speaking of Ber
nard Shaw's works, if they are not ade
quately presented, they cannot become
popular as stage productions. But as
books they will always be valuable. I'm
cure I wculd rather sit down and read
Shakespeare than to see him acted In
competently."
Of the American dramatist and his fu
ture Mr. Drew has sanguine hopes.
"He Is constantly improving," he said.
"Mr. Fitch and Mr. Thomas never did
better work than they are doing to-day,
and some of the newer authors' promise
well. No, playwrlting Is not a diseaseâ it
is a human condition that has existed
since acting began and will continue to
exist until the theater ceases to be. Re
markable, but undeniable, is the fact that
at some time In almost every person's life
the ambition to write a play, is uncon
trollable. Mostly women? Not a bit of
It. How some men can epare the time to
write drama Is more than I can fathom.
It is needless to mention how few of
them, men cr women, construct anything
that a sane manager would accept, and
the numerous rejections of unworthy ma
terial is what gives rise to the impression
that there is no field for dramatic au
thorship in this country. The fact is, that
never were good plays in- greater demand
than at present.
"But good plays do not spring full-pano
plied from the inexperienced or untrained
author's brain. One in a thousand first
plays may 'hit It off/ but that one is an
outcome of inspiration. Less than one In
a thousand persons possessed of purely
literary talent Is blessed with the peculiar
ability that Is essential to genuine dra
matic construction. There's The Duke of
Killlcrankie,' for Instance. It was writ
ten by Captain Marshall, a British arm}'
officer, \u25a0whose 'prentice hand had been
tried and trained by the writing of eev
eral sketches for amateur acting before
he obtained a London production."
"Is this your last season as the eccen
tric Scotch noble ?"
"Tes; in August 'i commence rehearsal
of a new modern comedy by an American
author whose name I am not now at lib
erty to divulge." , .
"I hayÂ« read or heard that you will
cpend your resting time In California."
"\u25a0yt>u read It. and I was waiting for that
remark." laughed Mr. Drew. "Since my
arrival here It has been addressed to me
by ever so many people, and I have
traced its Inspiration to an unauthorized
newspaper statement, which has con
vinced me tnat the less veracious a news-

promise of marriago against Frederick
Robinson, an official in the employ of tha
Clacton-on-Sea district council.
The parties became acquainted In Janu

service of the Denton district council.
The two were returning home by train In
the following October, when the defend
ant took, an engagement ring from his
pocket, put it on her finger and swore toÂ»
be faithful to the love he promised her.
Affectionate relations subsisted down to>
the time the defendant left Denton to ga
to Clactoh. On the way he called at Lin
coln, and feeling very lonely went to tho
cathedral and there poured out his soul
In a letter. He wrote: "Ethel, dear. I am
lonely; but, dear, I am trying to cheer up.
I ana downhearted, but we must hope for
better things and that our union may be
soon, so that we may bear, one another's
burdens. .Yours ever. Fred."

It is said that Continental Europeansâ
particularly the French and the Italiansâ
btlieve all traveling Americans to hall
from New York, Chicago or San Fran
cisco; that New Yorkers, being nearer
Europe and therefore amenable to refin
ing influences, are civilized; that San
Kranclscana are semi-barbarous and Cbi
cagoans barbarous.
, Now, there are those among our towns
people who sympathize with the French
irsn'B or the Italian's classification. They
are those who have met some of their
towsnfolk abroad, whose weird conduct I
was such as to bring condemnation upon
the heads of Those Who Knew Better.
Perhaps the commonest mode of giving
offense to foreigners, and which relent
.. leesly reveals the vulgarity of the of
fender, is the endless comparison, in a j
tone of amused disparagement, of the i
"manners, the food and the habits of the â¢
people with those In America.
This type of traveler Is met with all
over the Continent, but more frequently
In the paths trod bare by the agencies.
And not only is disparaging comment
made, but it Js frequently made aloud,
presumably in the belief that English Is
not understood. Perhaps it isn'tâ but
there Is that in the manner that implies
ridicule, and ridicule is the same in all
languages.
The fact that upon a difference in cus
toms and modes of living is what consti
tutes the chief interest in travel is wholly
lost eight of by the wandering "ejlts,"
who ought to be kept at home by law
Â«ntil they acquire either sense or silence,
but who by some strange dispensation of
Providence possess the wherewithal to
travel, and "do Europe" because it's the
thing to do. And then must their intelli
gent townsfolk or countryfolk bear tho
etigma of their stupidity.
Another thing that shocks the foreigner
is the capacity of most Americans for ab
sorbing artâ "going through" the gal
leries in half a day and talking glibly,
but always generalizing, about the won
derful treasures therein. And It comes to
be something of a Joke among the artists
â¢"fcterea-bouts to ask gome lately returned
traveler, who Insists upon prating of her
"trip abroad," about some famous picture
that mayâ or may notâ exist. For about
\u25a0 this European madness is much of fad
, diem and much of poso.
, But while it remains good form for
mammas to whisk their daughters off to
Europeâ even for a six weeks' tourâ it
might be well, in order that San Francis
co may soon rate with New York as a
"civilized" community, to heed the advice
given by President Roosevelt in a recent
addressâ that Americans dlf play courtesy
and civility toward foreigners, thereby
winning their respect and friendship.
And we might go even further and add
that they may win the respect and
friendship of their fellow countrymenâ
the Americans Wbo Know How to Be
have.

The engagement of Miss Marie Louise

seems to be a settled thingâ that is. there
has been no vehement denial ot the sweet
etory. And it is a sweet story, for the
attraction of one for the other was very
apparent last summer when the pair
were much together at .Montereyâ the
Monterey that McComas has made known
in many climes through the medium of
his clever brush. .
And by the way, good fortune, like its
gloomy antithesis, rarely comes singly. I
hear that not a McComas painting of
the Vickery exhibit, (which I had : the
privilege of reviewing) ' remains unsaid.
You know it's : one thing to paint good
pictures," and another to get the people
to buy them. , . â¢ . v
Mr. McComas seems to be doing both. .;
when The Prophet swore he. would, ruin
the young men, and called upon God and

In the affidavits the statements made
on each side are contrary in the extreme,
the bakery proprietors and their constitu
ents declaring that violence has been
used by the strikers, and the labor un
ions insisting that only "mild arguments"
were employed to persuade the strike
breakers to Quit work and the customers
to cease trading with the tabooed firms.
. After reviewing the rights of employes
to quit work at their own volition, and
rights of employers to hire others to take
tneir places and not be molested for so
doing, Judge Murasky says:
"To go a step further, ; there seems to
be little doubt. If any, that those who
have quit work may seek to induce those
who have taken their places to abandon
their employment, provided no compul
sion, threats, intimidation, violence or
any similar influence which might operate
agalns tthe exercise of an untrammeled
volition be used. While it is true that
employes have the right to quit their em
ployment, singly or in a body, with or
without cause, and in the advancement
of their Interests to ask others to do the
came, equity will protect the employer ;
against a malevolent conspiracy to de
stroy his property, and any combination
which, has for its purpose the destruction
of his business by preventing Its opera- \
tion through intimidation of those who
deal with or work for him may be en
joined.
"The defendants In the case at bar are
within their rights, therefore, when they
leave their employment, when they peace
ably and. by the exercise of reason pnly
seek to persuade others not to deal with
or work for plaintiffs, and are beyond the
law "when they do more.
"It is a general 'and I think undisputed
rule that a combination of persons
formed to do an unlawful act may be re
shrained. Here, among other things. It is
alleged tKat in furtherance of their de
sfgns defendants circulated a card bear-
Ing false and defamatory, statements con
cerning the business of plaintiffs.
"To publish a libelous statement Is un
lawful, and while a mere libel as such is
not the subject of injunction, a conspir
acy to injure property by means of false
publications may be restranied, as would
any form of combination to do any un
lawful act, for the purpose of working ir
reparable injury." ,; ['\u25a0;
A temporary Injunction was issued yes
terday by Judge Murasky to restrain the
members of the Bakery and Confection
ery Workers' International Union and
other labor organizations from maintain
ing a boycott against J. ,W. Thorp & Co.
and other firms that are in the black
books of the union. The temporary order
is granted. â¢ the court points out. on the
strength. of affidavits, "and is to be taken
in no' sense as Indicative of the final out
come of -the proceedings, when the: wit
nesses shall have given oral testimony
relative to the alleged methods of coer
cion and boycott used by the strikers."
August Geber was sentenced by Judge
Dunne to be hanged at San Quentin on
a date to be hereafter fixed. After sen
tence was pronounced Geber started to
Fay something, but was quickly silenced.
\u25a0 Geber had been employed temporarily by

to do odd jobs in the store, and lived with
. the family. On Sunday morning, July 10,
Geber quarreled with Haxtman about his
breakfast, and procuring a revolver from
his bedroom fired a shot at Hartmann.
but missed him. Charles Hartmann, a
son, was the next target, and the bullet
took effect, killing Charles almost ln
. stantly. George, another son, and his
mother held the door to prevent Geber
from leaving, and Geber fired three shots
through the door, one of the bullets strik
ing George and fatally wounding him.
Not satisfied with his bloody work, Geber
fired at Mrs. Hartmann as she bent over
the body of her dying son, and finished by
atttempting to shoot Policeman Jerome
H. Tyrrell, who arrested him. "For his
bravery Tyrrell was presented with a
gold medal by the Police Commissioners.

locket and 30 cents, and hit him on the
head with the butt end of his revolver.
Whie Aschen was walking away Wilson
fired a shot at him. There were six other
robberies to Wilson's credit in the same
locality. Since ISS2 "Wilson has. spent
most of his time in prison, and the Judge

33S Croasley BIdK4 â¢ Ssm ' Fraactocs, CsJ.is when we leave all mere ana-
I tomlcal considerations and ask the
\u25a0 ultimate questions^ â how does mind
'â¢ ' affect matter, and how does mat
ter display mind?â that we realize our
nescience. Granted the nervous mechan
ism I have indicated, we are not one
whit the better able to answer a ques
tion for which our very conception of
cause and effect is Inadequate. We can
not conceiveâ though many of us think
we canâ of ah idea movlrjg a table,' or a
table moving an Idea, The difference be
tween mind and matter is greater, im
measurably.- greater, . than all 8 other dif
ferences whatsoever/fand our concept of
causation Is inadequate to conceive how
the one affects the other. Four attempted
solutions I must enumerate. The Idealist
easily solves the difficulty. There is noth
ing but mind, of which matter is the,cre
ature he says. And as Hume said of
Berkeley, the most consistent and logical
of "all idealists, 'His arguments admit of
no '; answer and produce .no conviction.*
Then there is Huxley, who appreciates
with all of us the difficulty of understand
ing how mind can affect matter, and
therefore denies any such Influence. We
are conscious \u25a0 automata he says, unable
to affect or effect anything, consciousness
being \u25a0 merely an epl-pnenomenon or by
product, an interested spectator not al
lowed or able to join in the game. Of
this theory the difficulty Is that It was
conceived by a consciousness, and then
disowns Its creator and source. For you
will observe that in order to explain- con
sciousness we have only the evidence and
conclusions of consciousness to grulde us.
Similarly a man may try to lift himself
by his own collar. The" third solution Is
that affected In the â¢ academic atrcles of
Co-day. It admits that mind anil matter
cannot mutually Interact, and therefore
.proclaims a psycho-physical parallelism:
Mind and matterâ or consciousness and
cortex, for this school knows nothing of
subconscious mindâ move In- parallel- lines,
one' mental state affecting . another, and
one. neural state another; but: the two
lines, though produced~ever so- far,* never
meet. Material changes, however, . will
cease to affect mental states whin opium
ceares to cause sleep and music delight;
not before. And, lastly, there la the ex
planation of Spinoza and Spencer, which
regards mind and matter as correlated
and Inseparable manifestations of tha
unknowable. This explanation will cease
to hold the field when we learn on what
other hypothesis an Invisible and single
cell, which would not cover the of
a lead pencil, can receive ' certain - salts,
protelds, water, air and lightâ and develop
Into a nervous system with Its attendant
organs, whence may proceed an Erolca
Symphony or a 'Hamlet.* " â C. W. - Salee

nr*HÃ -.recent -appearance of immense
I / groups of spots upon the sun, taken
\u25a0 " r in Jconnectlon-wlth' the vagaries of
the;, weather during . the past winter and
with the suggestion of Professor. Samuel
P.'iLangley* that the radiation of the sun
has .within the ; past two or three years
undergone - measurable variations affect
ing? the : general temperature of our plan
et,''brings the subject of the cause and
nature : of sunspots and their "possible ef
fect* upon the earth once more prominent
ly-"be'f ore" the 'public, ! says Garrett P. Ser
viss in Success ; Magazine.' - It ' is a ques
tion *\u25a0 that concerns all mankind. If the
supposed effect exists our interest is not
diminished by the fact, that it is a thing
completely beyond human control or In
terference. -But, being forewarned and
understanding the nature of the disturb
ing forces, we may conceivably mitigate
the results to ourselves.
Just now the sun Is approaching a state
of maximum disturbance. Something Is
going on In his mighty globe which pro
duces tremendous upheavals on his sur
face, and these are accompanied by the
appearance of black spots, so large as oc
casionally to be visible to the naked eye,
although we are 93,000,000 miles away from
them. Just what these spots are we do
not know, but there are excellent reasons
for believing that they show the exist
ence of vast expanses of cooler material
floating In the photosphere of the sun;
somewhat like masses of cooled â¢ slag <m
the surface of liquid Iron. If they were
extensive enough to cover all, or nearly
all. of the; solar surface the sunlight aud
the supply of heat would he practically
cut off from the earth and it wotild ceas*
to be a habitable globe. : -.
Some of the distant suns In the heavens
have apparently reached this stags and
thus have ' perished; others are far ad
vanced In the same direction, and many
of these exhibit enormous variations ot
light, alternately flaring up and then
dying down like bonfires. Our sÂ«n. how
ever, seems to be only In the first stags
of this great process of gradual extinc
tion, and the variations caused In tha
amount of his radiation have not yet be
come serious enough to threaten disaster
to hiÂ» attendant planets. Still theyarÂ»
great enough to attract attention, and
their effects upen the earth may unques
tionably be measured provided we can
discover the precise manner in' which
they manifest themselves. That they are
somehow related to magnetic < storms Is
now fairly well settled, but it remains to
determine their precise relationship to tha
weather and to the temperature.-
Is the Sun Losing Power?
SOME older -woman friend' met a
young and pretty girl who seemed
- Â«... always to be able to have her cheeks
momentarily suffused with red when she
wished, and asked i her:
[\u25a0 "Why. do. you -Invariably -blush-at .the
/ rights timer*: : : '. ".\u25a0;\u25a0'. \:.'. r :-*V â¢
"I think" of something to make .me
blush," the girl replied, with apparently
Innocent candor. \u25a0 ;.."\u25a0-.
It is a good story, whether true or not.
and it suggests *a good rule to adopt In
other . things. - Everybody remembers that
the": man who .was; looking for trouble ;
found' it; .now. the "girl- who wished, to
blush; went looking- for itâ and found it:
and it; would- seem , to ibe an equally' : sen
sible -and assured plan to go looking for
cheerfulness if you do not happen to have
It about you. ' \u25a0. .. \u0084,--....*Â» '
; Nb one living who rises above the In
telligence of the feeble-minded', falls to â¢
have- recollections, pleasant: and unpleas
ant. It is one , of; the great .facts in life
that we constantly tend, when, we are in
health, to .forget .the unpleasant' thingsâ
the .things \u25a0 worth forgetting.- Let them
go 'with as little thought as possible. "
But - hang to the ; things . worth remem
bering, the bright 'and- cheerful things
that made \u25a0 you laugh when \u25a0 you saw Â« or
heard them, and make you smile now. It
is no great matter to store- the. mind with
.-them when there Is ; nothing/else to do.
Have such 'â¢ recollections ion. tap. las It
were; when you aren't feeling -quite np to
the mark bring ;tbem out andÂ« give th<jm
an airing. Rain will not harm them and
they "cannot be dyed blue . under ' any

Acquaintances and 'friends are like rec
ollections. Once la a longtime youÂ«'me*t
a person who fails to> cheer you op if
you need It. one. whom you, could mot
cheer up If you tried. Leave him alono
when you are not feeling as well as you
wish, and go after the- other, kind. Misery
loves company. It Is said, but It doesn't
necesarily love miserable company.
Remember, too. that there Is nothing
easier to bear than the misfortunes of an
other. ' No matter what company you
seek, if It Is not that of a professed cynic
or pessimist, you, are almost certain to
ffnd cheer and encouragement.
At -the end, however, you win turn to
the sunny sort of person, the man or
woman who makes cheerful recollections.
Go to him looking for cheer and you will
find It. Then bear In' mind that he has
put you under obligations which can be
repaid only by taking a similar message
to some one else who needs it.
Bear ye one another's burdens.

/, A LIEX influx into the population of this country* is the subject
l\ of one of the papers in the latest quarterly bulletin of the,
Department of Labor of the State of New York. The figures
show that the f changed character of the multitudes now coming
make immigration a very different proposition from what it was in
former decades when it was fully encouraged. New. York is the
best State in the Union in which to study immigration, for a very
much larger proportion of it locates there than anywhere else. In
the last quarter of last year 63,188 chose New York for residence,
or two-fifths of all arrivals. The concentration of so many aliens
there makes a big problem for the State.
j^ The increase, in the proportion declaring New York as their
idestination is very .noticeable, for while the last annual report
showed only 32 per cent of the total, the last quarter of. the year
footed up &i per cent who expected to settle in that State.
A consideration of the statistics from New York makes quite an.
argument against the admission of so many aliens of the class now
coming. Such wholesale admission must inevitably lower the
grade of our citizenship, and, if kept up for a few decades, will
greatry change the character of the republic. In i960 about one
quarter of our foreign-born were from Germany, and of these only
4 per cent were illiterate; but in the present tide that is flowing into
New York only 8 per cent come from Germany, while more than. a
quarter are coming from Southern Italy and of* these 54 per cent
are illiterate. Dealing wife larger figures," 73 per cent are now com
ing from Southern and Eastern Europe and 30 per cent of these are
illiterate, and only 24 per cent are coming from Northern and
Western Europe, among whom the illiteracy is only 2 per cent.
Illiteracy, however, is not the chief objection. . In the'population
'of New York there are 3 per cent of aliens, while of the inmates of
insane and charitable institutions the alien proportion is 20 per cent.
That is, qne-fifth of all the public charges are aliens, although the
alien population is only one-thirty-third of the ; wHble. The reports
from New York do ;iot distinguish the. aliens in penal institutions,
but some figures from the whole United States tend to 'show the;
evil of immigration in that way. The. percentage of alien inmates in
penal institutions is 29 per cent of persons who have been in this
country less than six years, as. opposed to-spercent of those who
have been here from thirty-one to forty years.. The: evidence is
strong that the average new comers are distinctly inferior -to the'
native population and to the immigrants of ten to, twenty, years!
back. It; does not seem possible that our country can be held back
from deterioration by the inflow of immigration unless the privilege
of residence here be made a competitive thing by which- wenvilHget
the best instead of so much of the worst from foreign 'nations. "

THE EXPOSITION OPEN.
rpHE first considerable Western exposition was \u0084the^ Midwinter
I Fair in San Francisco, following the Columbian Exposition}, at
1 Chicago, as the Lewis and Clark Exposition at Portland^ollow*
the great Louisiana Purchase event at St. Louis. Our Midwirtfir Fair,
as its title indicated, had first among the purposes an exhibit of our
climate. It was a great success in every respect. The oxhib.its were
attractive and as a place of entertainment, aimiseinent'and'histruc-
tion it was the resort of great companies; of people from near anti
far, who enjoyed it all at a season when the East; was lockedt in .the
cold and snow of winter. Out of ' its success- came the foundation
of the great museum in Golden Gate Park", 'which is one of- the most
interesting show places and schools for study 'in* art,, archaeology,
and history in the Union.' â¢- â¢ - \u25a0 â¢â¢â¢
The Portland exposition, which has been ppened^by the Presi
dent of the United States, and has begun ; with stately ceremonies
that stir the spirit of the West, is a step .^forward from, our :'Mid
winter Fair. It emphasizes a historical^event-of the first order..
The expedition of Lewis and Clark a hundred years ago ... was one
of the early steps taken in our domination of the continent.. It .de
termined our interpretation of -the treaty with Bonaparte respecting
the boundaries of the Province of Louisiana, and though we-subse
quently took a quitclaim of Spain for Oregon, we were at all times
ready to assert our title. \u0084.\u25a0Â»'..
Since the intrepid explorers crossed the wilds of the continent
we have fought the war of 1812, the Mexican and Spanish wars,
each in its result having an important bearing upon our national
history, but the achievement of Lewis and Clark stands uneclipsed
by the stirring events of a century.
â¢ * The city of Portland and the State of Oregon deserve the praise
-and support of the whole West for the enterprise they have shown,
and their fidelity- to an ideal. Their exposition is less local than
our Midwinter Fair. It is a far look backward to 1805. The century
was not all given to the development that now graces the- line of
march taken by the explorers. It was well past the middle -of, the
last century before our school geographies ceased teaching that the
Great American Desert began at the Missouri River and reached
to the Pacific Ocean.
The Portland exposition represents only, about fifty years of
Western development. It has been wrought upon, a country that
was as mysterious and unknown as darkest Africa. " In that time
California has moved rapidly through the stages of mining, stock
ranging and wheat growing to intensive farming. Arid Qregon and |
Washington and all the Northwest have disclosed a bewildering
variety of resources which make of it an imperial region. :. When

What the author's words can do toward,
depicting this masterpiece of art may be
slightly suggested by the quotation of a
fragment from* the story whose, "whole

markable brush work of the half-mad

the present war to find in Prince Kro-,
potkln's "Russian Literature" an ; ac
count of Tolstoy's youthful, military
prowess, "He lived through all the
dreadful experiences of the defenders
of SebastopoL . â¢ . â¢ â¢\u25a0_â¢ He ha* s thÂ«
right to speak of war; he knows.lt frota,

pertinent facts -.that Tolstoy "obstl-
nately refused during the siega to.be-^
come an officer of the staff, and re
mained with his battery in the most
dangerous spot," and that, though he
seems' nefer again to have written
yerse," he "at that time "composed. In

he described- the blunders of the com

Wilkinson - snakes this criticismâ a criti
cism whose strength resides partly in its
restraint:
"When the mind recovers itself and be
comes undazzled from the blinding effect
of such sudden magnificence, it per
ceives clearly that here is a highly
rhetorical expression of what, through
out, is Mr. Beecher's governing thought,
namely, that love as a sentiment, an emo
tion, in distinction from love as obedi
ence to God. is the ideal to aim at. I
say nothing against this thought; I need,
indeed, say nothing whatever about it,
except that it is not the ideal presented
in Scripture."
So throughout the book in these criti
cisms of men's religion tbe thought of
obedience is strongly emphasized, and in
criticirfng their language his belief is
made plain that in the use of words rever
ence for literary excellence 2is closely
bound up with true ethics and genuine
ness of ananhood.. in -
The work is written both for preachers
and .for the general reader- Any one who
cares for literature for letters' own sake
will enjoy It. very much. One of the best
uses of Reading it will b> \u25a0 that ' he ; who_'
does 6.6.,'wi1l. likejy gain thereby in'cipa^
city to appreciate the thotigbtful sermons
they may hear. Fine things In the way
of pulpit . masterpieces "are often heard
unappreciatively. How difficult they are
to doâ to be perfect in "obedience to re
ligious law, and to be so reverent of the
truth cf pood taste in the language that
conveys the thought with " sonorous - per
suasion to ears held to attention by -the
speaker's skillâ all the aptitude and the
preparation that this task involves will
be more clearly realized in the pews after
our attention has been called -by a keen
homiletic critic and an ardent lover of
our language to the beauties" and also :
the flaws that exist in the- work even of
the world's great masters of pulpit dis
course. Sometimes when we listen, let
ug remember this sentence from John
Hall, the irreat preacher whose extraor
dinary endowment of common sense is
said to be glorified into genius, and whose
distinguishing trait of character and of
lanjruage is genuineness: "Gentlemen,
we ministers are not heathen philosophers
finding out things: we are expositors of
a revelation that settles things."
Perhaps as fair ; a sample as can be
given In brief space of Wilkinson's work
in portraying the pastors for us is the
following, in which, speaking of the great
preacher. Pere Felix, he. combines high
praise with a little touch of adverse.crit
icismâshowing the one thing lacking
in a truly great man: . ,
"Hearing him preach was like seeing a
salt crystallize. - His matter seemed in
stinct with some spirit of life that moved
It Into perfect forms. Every â¢\u25a0 sentence
was a formulated thoughtâ definite, clear,
sharp, ultimateâ like a crystal. ' The
whole discourse was a glittering mass of
crystallization. â¢ â¢ â¢ . How â¢do I -ac
count for this strange phenomenonâ the
absence of sympathy between speaker
and hearerâ in the midst of such re
splendent oratory? ffflt the repellant
charm, radiant around that white-robed
priest, of his Jesuitical character. - He
stood there insulated vntlrely from the
electric touches of those \u25a0 human , hearts,
by the vitreous non-conductors of his
eccleslastlcism â¢ â¢ â¢ priest, celibate,
Jesuit, how solitary he was! I could have
pitied my human, brother: but in the
pride of schooled and Imperial intellect,
he wanted nothing that the heart had to
offer."
The best chapter In the book is an ap
preciation cf Eugene Bersler. whose work,
Is estimated to be more likely to take a
permanent place In literature than . that
of any of the other preachers of modern
times. His sermons, either in translation,
or better, in the French, are urgently
recommended by the author for the read-
Ing of all preachers who would .excel by
studying the best models. LÂ«et us imagine
him, whose words are to go furthest down
the aces. to br in the pulpit, while we
listen for moments to" a fragment of . his
discourse:
"Consider, from this point of view, the
manner in which Jesus Christ trains "and
prepares his disciples. I nave just been

carr.ate Word. All through the book,
like a gold thread in a varied texture,
goes this author's clew to men's char
acter â the use they make of the gift of
speech.
One of the reasons given for this
kind of criticism i* thus explained by
the writer, when he is talking about
J*fcillip* Brooks:
"Do I seem to be applying a literary
standard to what is bomiletlcal rather
than literary? I acknowledge the ex
istence here of a valid distinction. But
I insist there is true ethical, and even
religious, teaching force in what I
have elsewhere calJed 'strict literary
e6nscience." applied to such things as
are row pointed out. And this series
of criticisms had a faithful and serious
aim to help make the prevalent prac
tice of the pulpit, even In subordinate
things, better and better. Is not the
aim worthy?"
The book is perhaps as useful as a
study of literary values as it is of great
preachers. It would be well worth
reading by ary one who loved the pow
ers and beauties cf language, erven
though his interest In religion or biog
raphy were too little for the title of
the work to attract him. The author
not only gives you accounts of the
rr 't*"i? of great masters of language,
but he writes masterfully himself. * If

This predilection of the author for
**the strict literary conscience," and his
keen search for . verbal blemishes and
beauties, ..does sot set aside from our
rea.liza.tlon the firm purpose which be
holds to throughout the volume of
writing criticisms of these masters of
pulpit discourse from the point of view.
of a saa with strong and clear-cut re-,
iigious convictions. We can get a 'good
idea of where he places himself for
tiu* purpose by beginning with the
paragraph et the very back of the
book: "No persuasion enters more.
deeply into my mind, my conscience,
and my heart, than the persuasion that
I press tic message chiefly needed by
the church of to-day, when I present
Paul as the highest human model for
til preachers, and in especial when I
most commandir.gly present him as.
above all things else, the apostle of
obedience to Christ."
It ; la by this standard our critic
measures every man who stands in the
pulpit; and a fine example of his appli
cation to the rule is in the chapter
where be puts Beecber to the test of It,
and that greatest of pulpit orators
sinks away Into comparative insignifi
cance when measured with the greater
preachers, who. though less orators,
had more obediently sought to know
tfcÂ« mind of their Master- and to teach
It to the multitudes of men who came
to hear them. This study of Beech er
is an interesting example of the meth
ods of our -author as combination critic
of both a man's' religion and Ms lan
guage, and a showing of bow closely
linked is a man's use of language td
his ethics and bis religion. It is as If a
man practiced In such criticism could
have listened to the words that fell
from Beecher'n lip* and prophesied that
he would fail, and explained just why
he would fail, with only his pulpit
words to Judge by. He could also tell
yon by'thls test why the preaching 1 of

the charter of a small schooner which
they propose to sail to Cocoa Island and

Wo the covÂ«U:d gold only the memory of
a dreaSj that owe came to one of them.
In the dream the location of the treas

the dreamer Is. prepared to spend, his

to a test the authenticity of the noc

â¢ The liners Valencia and Zealandia sailed
yesterday afternoon for Nome, both heav
ily laden with freight and crowded with
passengers. They are the first vessels to
leave this season for the northern gold
fields. Broadway wharf, from where thÂ©
Valencia sailed, and Pacific street wharf,
from where the Zealandia took her de
parture, Tc-Â«?re crowded all day with pas
s^-ngers and .their friends.
Although the crowds could "hardly have
t>Â»en larger, there was missing that ex
citement which attended the sailing of
the vtsselJ which carried the pioneers of
the first Alaskan rush. Most of the pas-
FCnsers wore clotHes" which stamped the
tvejjrpfa as prosperous, and the fearful
ana wonfisrful '"outfits" of the Chilcoot
Pass days were conspicuous by their ab
e<= nee. Neither a. blanket suit nor a dog
was in evidence at either wharf, and
among the passengers the presence of
many women and children borÂ© testimony
to the gentler condition of living in the
far north. '

V PARIS, June 3.â Since -. the Three
Musketeers held their bastion against
a whole army, France -has. witnessed
some novel s sieges, but never a sturdier
defence than that made by . Francois
Roy, the gamekeeper. who recently kept
700 gendarmes and troops at bay ;for
.ten days. .;â¢ * L . _, ' : S^
Roy is a peppery, tempered old fel
low of seventy,, but still remarkably
spry on his legs and tough- as hickory.
He was' a soldier in ~ his earlier, days.'
Later he became a gamekeeper and was
suspected of using that office to. facili
tate his own exploits ,as a , poacher.
Anyhow he was accused of preying on
the game he: was paid protect and
lost his. situation,, ln consequence. He
swore to be revenged on those who had
caused -him to be deprived of his situ
ation. ' At : the first chance he fired on
one- of the men : who. had lodged in-:
formation against , him." That brought
the law down on "him and a warrant
was issued for his arrest.- . .'
Roy declared that like the Old Guard
he might die. but would" never; surren
der. He retired to his little, cottage
and prepared it to withstand 'n> siege.
Standing alone on a slight , eminence in
the village -of Usseau,' near ' Chatel
leraut, It" was well situated for defense."
Roy lald'in a stock of ammunition .'and
provisions, pierced the four , walls with
holes and took pot shots at all emis
saries of the law who approached
wlthjn range. The discreet civilian au
thorities thereupon ; turned over the job
of capturing him to the military."
SMALL ARMY ENGAGED.
No fewer than 600 infantry and three
brigades of gendarmes surrounded j the
old fellow's improvised fort. Railway
companies ran excursion trains to the
village to enable visitors from afar to
witness the imposing spectacle.. At one
time there were several ; thousand of
them: present. -When there was no
\u25a0 shooting going . on they entertained
themselves with open-air dances to the
music of fiddles and gramophones..
.A French . general of divisionâGen
eral Badln, one of the Tonkin'heroes
was put in charge of the siege opera
; tions. A< cordon of troops was posted
around the house to keep civilians from
crossing the fire zone. Shooting went
on at long range on either side for
several days without anybody getting
hurt, but it was quite as lively as the
average French duel.. It was first in I
tended to starve the ex-soldier into
surrender, but it was concluded after
the lapse of more than a, week that that
process would take too long. As an ex
perienced campaigner, and forager Roy
had laid his plans to keep hunger at
bay for an Indefinite period. He: made
it apparent .to the -besiegers . that =he
was well provisioned by lth'e liberality
with which, he scattered food from 1 : the
windows of his \u25a0 fort ; among ; the s birds
and the fowls in his \ yard.. /And .the
spectators began to murmur that .they
were not getting their moneys) worth.
BOMBS : BROUGHT. IXTO PLAY. '"I
A council Of war; was. held.. -The; ldea

ing the cottage wjth artillery,' but; to
that the civil .'authorities objected un
less the military ; forces \u25a0 were . prepared
to 'give' a guarantee that no^other prop-,'
erty would be injured. ' Then it .was de
cided to blow up: the dwelling- with
melenite. The railway companies de
clined to transport so dangerous an
explosive. They, had a pecuniary inter
est in prolonging the show. Arrange
ments were then made for, transporting ;

text of President James W. Alexander's

Alexander's statement was long, and
went into ;the Frick correspondence*; in
detail. He claimed the Frjck report was
"in many respects unjust." and said it
was based "on incomplete data," at -'the
same time promising that there would
be submitted to the board statements
from the actuary of , the society, from
the secretary and from other officers.

It was reported that occurrences of " a

place. These reports were, however.;.in
spired from the same sources that -are
now attacking me. They were publish
ed when the conspiracy, to destroy my
reputation and deprive me of my posi
tion In the society was well under way."
Interest tn. the proceedings of the board
cf directors -when the Frick report 'was,
made was. renewed to-night when . the
Counsel for Hyde issued late to-day a
long statement defining Hyde's position In
reference to the attacks upoa him. In
this attention is called to the fact that
Hyde had repeatedly offered to trustee
his clock and had for many weeks urged
that a man "of dominating national rep
utation" be placed at the head of the so
ciety. The statement covers the details
of numerous stock purchases alleged by
Alexander to have been made at the in
stance of Hyde without consultation with
any members of the codety. and declares
them lo have been approved at meetings
of the finance committee at which Presi
dent Alexander was present.
Hyde reiterates his charges that Alex
ander conspired against Wm wth the de
sign ef ousting him from his position and
obtaining control of the society fr!m<^f.
AJTSWERS PERSONAL. CHARGES.
Hyde referred to the so-called sub
sidiary companies of the Equitable, and
said the Equitable had proSted through
these corpora tSoss. Other transactions
were.rcne into at" length. Of the more
personal charges Hyde said: \
"As to the charge that I hay* acquired
an unpleasant notoriety by reason of aiy
s-nd Hyde it was reported that Robert T.
Lincoln had been agreed upon by them
as the mas best qualified to assume the
chairmanship of the board of directors.
The prorrineat features of the Frtclc re
rcrt,- ibyat which there was bosndless
epea^ation ' when it was practically re
jected and suppressed &t the meeting yes
terday, proved when it was published in
full to-day to follow closely the outlines
forecast several days ago. Both Alexan
der and Hyde are severely criticized in
the report, which declares that, p-swrmlng
Hyde to be guilty of the things charged
ty Alexander, the latter is "culpably
negligent in acquiescing in them for so
long a period and in cot bringing them
to the attention cf the board of direct-

on tie rejection by tie directors yester
day and the publication to-day of the
report of the Frick committee, comes
the announcement that, the controversy
between President James W. Alexander
and Vice President James Hasen Hyde
is at an end and that these two gentle
men have concluded a defensive and of
fensive a^iacce. The basis of this agree
ment Is reported to be that they should
in tie future devote themselves to. the
Interests of life Insurance and keep all
Wall street rr.tftr.glements out of the af
fsirs cf the Ec.uits.ble.
Alexander and Hyde were" in conference
tr>-day with certain of their friends and
aiviser* for more than two hours." Deep
i-terest attaches to the results of the un
expected turn of affairs, the general in
ference being that it predicts a very de
termined tZczt to .reconcile the interests
cf t-'ie warring factions and re-establish
the direction of the society on a basis ac
ceptable to all. It also was made evident
to-day that there is scant probability
that the resolution of the directors yes
terday to create the cfSce of chairman
Â«-; the board, with plenary power over all
departments and affairs of the society
will ever be put into effect.

EmbassadoV \u25a0 Meyer: at; his' presentation
audience, his willingness â¢; and [desire to

is believed to have been, in the nature,
perhaps, of a stronger /reiteration of his
receptive attitude, without in any sense
being a formal tender of his good offices,
which might subject him to a rebuff.

The candidates are pluming themselves
along those lines. They are watching the
experiment of municipal ownership In
Chicago. They are "keeping tab" on the
railroad campaign of education. They are
closely and carefully studying railroad
rate sentiment as it develops In the vari
ous State Legislatures.
Secretary Taft. La Follette of Wiscon

Dtnecn of Illinois, Secretary Shaw and
Governor Cummins of lowa and Senator
Foraker are chief "among those men
tioned" as good timber.
More than any other man in the coun
try, not even with the exception of Mr.
Roosevelt. La Follette is Identified with
the cause of Government regulation and
control of railroad rates. He has just
won a great victory in the Wisconsin
Legislature and his success has advanced
him immeasurably as a Presidential pos
sibility.
Discussion of Presidential candidates is
based on the hypothesis that the West
will demand a man as courageous and
as good a fighter for the people as la
President Roosevelt.
Railroads have sounded popular senti
ment and read the signs of tho time.
Their Song distance forecast Is that. Mr.
Roosevelt, however much It may be
against his will and wish, will receive the
commands of the voters to run again and
that If he adheres to his promise and
absolutely refuses to be a candidate, pres
sure will be brought to bear upon ...ie
party to choose a standard bearer who
will perpetuate the policy of the present

was immediately received by the - Presi

so closely the visit of Count Casslnl,'-'it
was naturally inferred that the President
took occasion to communicate to Taka

on high authority that the German Eifc

yesterday afternoon with Count Cassini
after the latter's call at the White House
is but- one of Be veraC evidences of the
activity of the King's envoy at Washing

Embassador Durand. the British Erh
baesador, in a recent visit to the White
House placed the President in possession
of the views of King Edward, 'who would
welcome an early peace. The views of
the French Government .are well known
to be of a similar character. Several of
the more prominent diplomats were en
abled to give their governments the gen
eral features of the - conference with
Count Cassini," and to-day the whole dip
lomatic corps was aware of the important
words uttered by the President and spec
ulating upon their effect in St. Peters
burg.
. For an hoqr this afternoon Baron yon
Sternburg, the German Embassador, was
at the Russian embassy discussing the
situation with Count Cassini. Thus far
the latter has not heard from his Gov
ernment, and advices from Europe would
seem to indicate that the Czar and" his
Ministers have reached no deflnite deci
sion as to their future policy.

WASHINGTON. June B.â An impertant
conference was held at the White House
late . this afternoon, the participants, be
eides the President, being Secretary Mor
ton and Attorney General Moody. It re
lated to the arrival to-day at Manila of
the Russian cruisers Aurora, Oleg' and.
Jemtchug and tct the disposition to be
made of them. It* was determined to
await fuller information before a decision
was reached.
All three of the cruisers took part in
the naval battle in the Korean Straits a
week ago. Two of them, the Oleg and
Jemtchug. were supposed to have .been
sunk by . the Japanese fleet. The three
ships were damaged, but were able to
proceed under their own steam.
In the present circumstance vessels of
either of the belligerents would be per
mitted to remain at a neutral port only
twenty-four hourÂ»; or, if tho ships were
unsea worthy, only long enough to enable
them to make temporary repairs in order
that they might reach their nearest home
port. \u0084
What, if any, request Admiral Knquist
may make concerning the disposition of
the vessels Is not known here. He may
ask that they be interned at Manila until
the close of the war. Such a request
would be granted by _ this Government.
When a complete report on the arrival
of the ships at Manila will have been

I ing,tbe rounds, stopped before two pic
turesi ?"B; Karflol," -the signature read.
One was . a istudyJ in- black, grey and
gold. .a portrait of a woman and child,
full of maternal . tenderness speaking
ipeffable love." The other was a- study
in brown and yellow, a ruddy-cheeked,
I sandy-hairod boy, seated with one knee
I' crossed over the other and 100 king'in
quisitively, out. from, the canvas, with
big -serious eyes.' ;
I The board promptly accepted both of
J Karfiol's .pictures "and -gave I them a
place of honor, at the Salon. From that
moment Karfiol's success has bÂ«>en un
interrupted. ( His "Portrait of a Woman"
was one of the most admired pictures
in the 1904 Salon. For the 130 a Salon
he i lias painted what, he considers, his
masterpiece, a little, girl .seated with
folded hands and her feet drawn up on
the". rung> of the: chair. The rich tones
of some fruit on a ledge of wall at the
rear â¢ contrast with the somber \u25a0 lives in
which the dark-haired child is treated.
' He 'remained two seasons at the Na
tional Academy of Design. bchiÂ£ by far
the yon ng en ever admitted unUl'tbat
period. . and he always ttooO well,
though competing with men his seniors
by several -years, who -did -not conceal
the interest .which his evident talent
excited among." them.
.TVTien . he was sixteen years old Kar
fio! made up'his'nilnd that be would
come' to" Paris' to study." So' he started
PAIMTXGS OX nXHIBITIOX.
Before reaching the cjr* of fifteen
Karfiol derided that he had remained
lotijir ' enough In school and 'was ready
to tike up art seriously, tin small for
hi* age that he looked only eleven' or
twelve he rnari*hÂ«Â»d boldly up to thÂ«
oftVe of the New York National
Acsdemy of Design.
"When I presented -rayfeclf." Karflol
said, laughing, as he reea.led this first
event in . his artistic experience, ."â¢the
clerk feeowlod uown at me as if trying
to. make me feel twice as small as I
was."
This Inherited taste for art spoke
strongly in young Bernard, and even as
a Â«.hild he loved to roam about in the
\u25a0wood* and make sketches. But for
tome tJme he could not -decide what
bracch ot art appealed to Lira .most.
He thought of FinKÂ»ng; then he devoted
htmeelf to the piano, with which he
mzrle. great progress.
Nevertheless, he Lad continued to
<"\u25a0Â»â¢. and tit finally decided thut paint-
Ing was his vocation. Most of his time
Â«t school was devoted -to art ratlier
i2iÂ£n to his lessons. Ho Uud become
interested -in facial expression and
would resort tv the most unusual
pranks in order to observe the'effeets.
One day he scattered Umburger
cheese on the floor or the schoolroom
and drew the expression- of horror on
the teacher's face, followed by i indigna
tion cs Â£he staritd quest^>aing the
beys. The culprit w^e not found, for
little Karfiol was so assiduously plying
bis pencil thai it <2id not occur to" her
to euspect Mm.
"Thai boy m'Jft go on: he Uas a great
future." Jean Paul Laurens has said of
him. FerrJcr, one of the most noted
teachers- in the Julian Academy, who
has never commended any one. pointed
te a picture by Karnol Jind *aid to his
cia^s: "That is the way to paint."
Marcel BascUet. who believes flattery
tfajc most dangerous of things. . as
tounded" all iiss friends by saying to
Karfiol: 'You will make your way in
your profession." It was two years ago
that Bas^het spoke thus, shortly be
fore Karfiol. without, friends or iu
fl,ucnce, gained admission to the Saloti
st the age of sixteen, 'being the young
est ever thus honored. The prophecy
may be said to have been realized al
ready, for to-day there Is scarcely a
studio in -Paris where Karfjol's name
is not known. Not long ago a critic
went so far as to remark: "Since
"Whistler's death there is only one-con
temporaneous artift whom I find .inter
esting â Bernard KarSol."- ? . '*;-
Short as it still is. the career of this
Sifted American boyHs so full of strik
ing incidents ss to read like a romance.
Bernard Karfiol grew up in the Green
Poh:t .district of Brooklyn.. N. : .Y.
His father,. Benjamin, Karnol. had ar
tistic talent which he had been .unable
to develop, never having had a lesson.
However, some of Benjamin Karfiol's
attempts at engraving were so fine that
s specimen 'having come to- the-atten
t!on of. the- Ensperor Fran2 Joseph the
latter ordered from him a map of all
Austria to be done on a medal., This
-aJffjeult. task.- was executed with won
derful accuracy by Benjamin Karfiol.
and the medal U now in the Imperial
collection at Vienna.

driving a horse and buggy belonging- to
his employer. Dr. Howard, at excessive
speed o%'er a Market street crossing' which
was crowded with pedestrians, and Pa

arrest, informed. Judge Cabanlss that he

fore Police Judge Mogan his chest was
heavily decorated with medals 'and
other insignia, which he displayed with
an a!r of pride.
"Where did you get all that hard
ware?" his Honor tncuired.
The defendant's reply was so Inco
herent and absurd that his sanity was
questioned on the spot. The medals
and badges, he alleged, were rewards
for public services performed by him
in Italy and the.lJnlterl States, but close
Inspection revealed them to be adver
tisements of tobacco and other com
modities and that they were of .little
or no intrinsic value. Then their wear-j

roadway because the atmosphere of his
apartment was fetid. Asked* why. he
did not open his chamber window and
admit fresh air, 'he answered he had
never thought of that, but would cer
tainly utilize the hint If he were re
stored .to freedom. .-. :
His Honor decided it would be unwise
to pursue the inquiry further until the
Lunacy. Commission has examined the de
.fendant, and -the case was -accordingly

There wan no ocular deception about
It, however. There upon his back with

Mr. Solomon, who is a cattle dealer and
diminutive physically, but -gigantic of

complaint of his daughter, a spinster,
whose head he had struck with a crock

consequences of .the deed by. persuading
the young woman to believe that he was
repentant and would devote the remaind

her I happiness. She withdrew her com-

ARDMORE, I. T., June 3.--Governor
Porter of the Creek Nation says that the
tribal tax was never intended for incor
porated towns. Governor Porter said: "
"We nevir have asked for the enforce
ment of the law. because we regard It as
unjust under the existing conditions, but
since Secretary Hitchcock has taken the
matter up and ths courts havr all de
cided in our favor (here is no gainsaying
the fact that the tax Is legal."
"I do not belleve,7 he said, "that the
people will go to such extremes as to ren
der fc*uch a course necessary. I am, how
ever, determined that the law shall be en
forced."
"WASHINGTON, June 3.-Secretary
Hitchcok's advices from Muekogee, I. T.,
confirm the press dispatches from that
place In regard to the trouble over the
collection of the tribal tax. but the Secre

received by the Emperor at 10 o'clock
this morning. Mr. Tower presented the
congratulations of the President and tfie
people of the Unlted^States on the mar
riage of the Crown Prince.
The arrangements were admirable
throughout. Volunteer first aid assist
ants were stationed at intervals and took
care promptly of policemen and . others
who were overcome by the heat of _ the
sultry afternoon.
The pageant started at 5 o'clock and
had disappeared at 5:45 p. m. through one
of the arched doorways of the palace.
In the Inner courtyard the Emperor, the
Crown Prince, Prince Henry of Prussia,
and other members of the imperial fam
ily received the Duchess. She went wilh
members of the Imperial family to the
room of the electors, so called, and with
the Crown Prince signed the marriage
contract. .

The procession began to form between
4 and S o'clock In the afternoon on the
wide epace fronting the chateau, and then
moved through the Thiergarten to the
Brandenburger gate, the boundary of the
old dty. The course of the procession
lay for a mile through tfie Thiergarten.
Where the roads crossed there were 400
children who eang a choral, "God Greet
Thee." Their voices sounded sweetly in
the woods.
Along each side of the way veteran*
were lined up, while here and there
stands were erected under the shade of
the trees. When inside the Brandenburg
rr g-ate the Duchess came In view of one
of the broadest avenues in the world, Un
tpr den Linden, set from end to end with
four rows of -Venetian masts. Swinging
from mast to mast were ropes of ever
prÂ»Â»ens and roses, while the lime trees
were also hung with garlands of roses.
Thousands of flags fluttered on each
Fide of the avenue. Mecklenburg's red,
yellow and blue predominating. The per
spective from the arched gate to the pal
ace at the other end was most beautiful.
The procession stopped inside the gate
and 100 maids of honor in white curt
*\efl. Each maid was crowned with roses
and carried wreaths. The Chief Burgo
ruaster. In a purple robe, trimmed with
fur and wearing the heavy gold chain
Insignia of his ofSce. stepped forward
and read the address of welcome, which
was brief by the Emperor's request, so
as to spare the Duchess the ordeal of a
iong wait under many eyes. She thanked
the Burgomaster in a few simple words
and the procession began to move again,
the artillery at the other end of the Un
ler d^n Linden firing twenty guns.
The Duchess Cecilia of Mecklenburg-
Schwerin, who In her full title Is also
Princess of the Wends, arrived from
Echwerln at noon with her mother, the
Grand Duchess Anastasla. her brother,
Frederick Francis, the reigning Grand

OAKLAND, June s.â The Cooks' and
Waiters' Union lias pone out on strike.
The cause of the trouble Is ihe refusal of
the members cf the Restaurant Owners"
Protective Association Co sign the
agreement presented by the union, tlie
old one having expired to-day. The
rcMaurant owners sonic time aj?o de
cided to declare tY>r the upon simp, to
refuse to treat witU the union as an
organization and to rota!u the right t<>
liiro :'nd discharge cooks and waiters,
regardless of the tiniwii.
The proprietors did not, however,
make any attempt to break Ih* former
agreement with the union and have
from the first expressed themselves as
willing to grant all th<- demands as to
wasoe a'ld hours wlia-h are set forth
in the new agreement^ but only to.tlio
men as individuals- and not the union
as a body. The men insisted that Ihj
restaurant owners recognize the union
and bind themselves not to hire any
but union \n<\\. on the refusal to ac
cede to thrs<- terms the cooks and
waiters walked out t'tis -s:iurningr.
In only one instance, however, did
the strike find the proprietor unpre
l>^rctd. This was at the Palace Bak
ery, of which Henry Krack<> is the
proprietor. He had not made any
preparation to soct:rc bclp in case of a
strike and when his men left him he
xviiS forced to suspend Ltisiness for
Â«ever::l hours. This v/as the. only ease
wli^re the strike caused any serioii3
trouble, as all the other restaurant
owners had made arrangements to se
<Ore non-union help in the event of
trouble with the Cooks' and Waiters'
Union, and in every restaurant where
the men went out their places were ut
ooeo. taken by the men who had been
notified to be ready for work to-day.
J. R, Bowcn. the business agent of
the .Building: Trades Council, said this
afternoon that the striking cooks and
wait* rs would have the support of
every one of the labor organizations in
the'eity and county. lie said that it
\caa.~ very doubtful|if the members oÂ£
$.hp Teamsters' Union would deliver
irood.s or supplies to the restaurants on
th< : unfair list. Bower, also said that ;
tllo strike would probably receive the |
indorsement of the LSuildins Trades
*_V)i;iicil. the Provision Trades Council
aftd the Central Labor Council.
The first case of trouble alleged to
have liteu caused by the strike oc
curred at Fischer's lSakery this morn
ing. Wlir-ij the night crew in the
kitchen left after midnight, the oil
which is i:scd as fuel in the ranfje was
left turned on. Hooding the bottom of
the Tung<; where it could not be seen
irom the .outside. When the fire was
started this morning the accumulated
oil exploded, but fortunately no one
was injured. The proprietor of the
restaurant said:
"Th^re is hardly a possibility that
the oil could have been turned on and
tli^n turned oft' again by accident and 1
1 am compelled to believe that it was
the intention of the party who left the
oil in the ranee to injure men who
k hou ld take the places of the strikers.
I am inclined to believe that the guilty
man is the former niplit cook. Ben
liayles, for he was the only one of the
bigtit crew who knew anything: about
the workinjr of .the range"
The restaurant least affected by the !
strike iv.is the <Jas Kitchen, of which
John Marcovich is the proprietor. At
this restaurant only one man left in j
response to the strike call of the j
union and his absence caused no in
convenience.

LONDON", June 3. â "I did not want to
part with her," said Douglas Edmund
Fountain of Hamilton street,' Grimsby,
described as flllingr the dual office of
pawnbroker's manager and theatrical
manager.- In reference to his wife,
Grace Roslna. from whom bo sought a
divorce yesterday.
The petitioner had formerly been in
the same touring: company as his wife.
Before her marriage the respondent
bad been frequently with the core
spondent. Ernest Harcourt Labden. oth
erwise Russell, but on that gentleman
deserting: her she Implored the peti
tioner's assistance. The petitioner, out
of affection and pity for her. became
her husband.
Soon after the wife expressed a de
tire to see her mother, which Fountain
acceded to. and rave her the. money
for her fare to London. On her return
a few days later she Informed her hus
band that she had visited Russell in
Kecnlagton road.
He forgave her on condition that she
would give up all thought of RusselL
Later, however, he found letters writ
ten to . his â¢ wife by Russell, who \u25a0 ex
pressed gres.t affection and the desire
that she should return to thÂ« old life
previous , to her marriage. A violent
scene took place between Mr. and Mrs.
Fountain, "things flew about." includ
ing a salt cellar given them as a wed
ding present. Eventually she returned
to Russell.

. "Ilisr-n has definitely decided to write
ro more," says a private letter from
Christiania. My correspondent adds,
however, that he has been assured by
Ibsen's physician, the eminent Dr. Bull,
thct the dramatist's physical condition
is at present quite satisfactoryâ better,
in fact, than has been the case for a
long tim*>. "He sleeps, eats and rises,"
Raid thÂ« physician, "with the regularity
ef clockwork." Ibsen .is too weak,
however, to ivalk much, but sits as
usual in his bi? arm chair :it the fam
ous corner window watching the crowÂ«l
passing heneath him along the Dram
.wiensvejen. He is keenly interested in
the present crises between Norway anil
Sweden. Â«Â»nd quite recently remarked:
"Wherever there Is a big noise there is
also sure to be life, health and visor."
. Although but few months - have
passed since the death of Jules Verne,
no, less than three French cities have
settled on means of keeping his mem
ory alive. The first place to do so was
Chautenay, a manufacturing village
clos* to Nantes where Verne spent :â¢.
portion of *faiu youth. On the day after
bis death it wa* resoWed that one of
the streets in Chantenay should hence
forth bÂ«i called "Jules Verne ttreet."
A "fortnight later the town council of
Nantes arranged to set up a' tablet on
the house where he was born, to" give
his name to a square, and to open a
public subscription for a suitable statue
to his memory. At Amiens the authori
ties have decided to rename the Boule
varde Loiifrueville. where the famous
writer resided at the time of his death.
IBSEN TO WRITE .\O MORE.
Anthony Hope has a grudge against
commas. It seems that these marks of
punctuation get into Mr. Hope's books â
or rather into his proof sheets â In much
greater numbers than the novelist
thinks desirable and that he has a
world of trouble In getting them out.
Hope may be said to have gone to
'"headquarters" to register a protest re
garding the matter, for he dealt with
h>s grievance at the annual dinner of
the London Association of Correctors of
the Press. The author told these cor
rectors that they were too liberal with
commas and declared that if he sub
mitted to them as despots in many mat
ters he stood for freedom in that one.
Still another is to be added to the
many books that have Joecn written
about Dickons* unfinished novel. "The
Mystery of 13dwin Drood." In a forth
coming work to !>c called "Clu^s to the
MystcT f of Kdwin Drood," J. Curaminjj
Writers, a prominent student of Dlck
Â«Mss!an matters, will tell how he be
lieves the mystery wouM have been
toolved had I/ickens lived to complete
his romance. -<"â¢\u25a0":
It teems that the illness from which
Dr. Max Nordau has been . suffering for
the past two -months or more was a
pood deal more serious than was gen
erally imagined." Now, however, the
author of "Degeneration* Is able to get
out and he has left for Carlsbad to re
cuperate.
liOXDON, June'3.â Seldom has a more
Interesting; collection of autogmpli let
ters and docomenU been sold la Lon

When' Not' Cured,: Briiig-on Par-

Cured by Electro-Chemistry When
They "Are Jlot Even- Benefited by
;Othe^ Known
MKS. MAKTRIVEST. ; .
Rheumatism is a mighty bad dleeaae. Even
In mild cases the blood is poisoned and the
general constitution. Is weakened by it. When
rheumatism Is known' to be in tha system
the only safety lies in getting rid of It as.
quickly as possible/ for. there is no telling
v.-ben the mild i cases may develop serious
symptoms. -There are few \u25a0 more - painful con-
ditions than those brought about by '. a bad
attack of rheumatism, but aside from .the
pain there are other dangers. The power of
an arm or a leg* is' frequently destroyed by
an attack." of rheumatism that stiffens the
Joints or , shrivels the muscles. Mora Incur-
able strokes of paralysis are due to the poison-
Ing* influence of rheumatism upon .the. general
syt tern than Is credited by the | medical pro-
fession. Mild cases cf rheumatism are quickly
cured by -Electro-Chemistry and all poisons
are thrown ' out of the system.- which makes
It impossible for the disease to return, but
th* wonderful . thing, .about it all Is .that
Electro-Cbemlstry â¢ cur*s *thosÂ« - cases -which
Mtm Incurable and hopeless under all other
methods. The cur* of Mrs. Man' Rlvest.-a
well-known lady of Oakland, living at 1522
Forty-fourth street. Oakland. Is a case in
point.' Mrs. Klvest's- rheumatism settled In
her right knee. The knee was swollen to
three or four times its natural . size, it was
perfectly â¢ stiff. â¢ the ' â¢ had ' almost
entirely stepped, and the pain was unbearable.
Her home physician was giving her morphine
that she might get a little* rest." " The tissue
about the knee turned black, .as If gangrene
would -set In. and -two -well-known and re-
liable physicians had advised the sufferer to
have the I leg amputated above the : knee to
save her life. All . this goes . to show that
the case of Mrs. Rtvest was Just about as
bad- as a case could be/ and notwithstanding
the severity of it Electro-Chemistry cured the
sufferer In two monttrs"' time at a small cost.
When we consider that during her two months'
treatment by Electro-Chemletry she never /ex-
perienced a minute's discomfort in taking the
treatment, and when -.we I consider ' .that - her
great suffering was lessened from the , very
first treatment and that she did not take a
single dose of morphine after beginning the
Electro-Chemlc course, it- is. no- wonder that
people talk of this wonderful cure , and that
the happy \u25a0 cured patient is sending everybody
that she can hear ..of . wiffetiig.- with rheu-
matism to the Elertro-Chemlc Institute at
lIS Grant aye.. San Francisco, to be cured.
Electro-Chemistry Is successful In all dis-
eased conditions and Is especially recommend-
ed In consumption, catarrh, asthma, bron-
chitis, deafness, ringing ears, head noises,
dizrtnees, cancers, tumor*, ulcers, old sores,
eczema, pimples, eruptions, hesdache. neu-
ralgia, rheumatism, locomotor atasia, para-
Ijsis eczema blood poison diseases of tlia
stomach, liver and bowele. constipation. Indi-
gestion, piles, fistula, female diseases, such
as displacements Irregularities, painful ovar-
ies., tn diseases "of the kidneys, Brlght's dis-
ease diabetes, inflammation of the bladder,
special \u25a0 diseases of men, such as prostatitls;
nerve -exhaustion, stricture- and trnlarged pros-
tpte. -In all caÂ«e B consultation and examina-
tion is free. The Electro-Chfmlc home treat-
ment Is very successful.' "Patients living at a
distance are loaned a full Electro-Chemlc out-
fit for the home. treatment. It Is always best,
however for such a person to come for a
personal"- examination : when possible. The
Electro-Chemlc Institute,- the only -one on- the
Pacific Coa*t. Is located at 118 Grant avenue,
corner jot Post street. San Francisco. There
are separate and private apartments for the
accommodation of male and female patients,
and 'the office hours are. from n in the morn-

LONDON, June 3.^â ls a' doctor justi
fied In I violating the code or medical
ethics in order to avert 1 a possible
disaster that may cause a great loss
of human life? .. / \u0084 '1
That In a j nutshell is . the question
which a perplexed member* ofjthe. v med
ical profession has submitted. .to the
British Medical .Journal for solution
and has been answered in" effect by
that hi&h authority. that his first duty
is to stick 'to' the - code., lets theYecrise'
quences be what" they may. " As the
case on which : the moral .conm;dr.um
is based is a- remarkable one""arj^the
etiquette, of the profession "is abb&t the
same on' both \ sides -of ; . the AtlattOc2 ;lt
Is a matter that will possess sonj.er.fh
terest' for American readers. \u25a0 r^ I .'
It appears that a certain doctorrvho
is e'ngra&ed by^-a railway .proyidentVso
ciety,. managed by the men and : not^'by
the 'company,, was consulted by a fÂ«f&
nalman who vi-as" found to be suffeflilo
from heart disease, that ;mig:ht cause
him to drop' dead at any moment or
without warning render him incapable
of attending: to the work on whosVper
formance depended the safety of thou
sands of 1 passengers. On this j account
the doctor urged him to seek' some
ether employment where his liability
to sudden death or collapse would not
endanger other lives. The nian re
fused. Other jobs were not easily
found, especially "by a man Buffering
from heart disease. Self-preservation
was tho first law of nature. Therefore
he would stick to his -job and the' trav
eling "public who need that particular
section of .the line over which he stood
guard wou'd have to take s ' their
jchances. By such t reasohliilg he * found
It easy to justify his decision;
But the- medical man i was -haunted
by the knowledge that his patient's
condition might lead to an appalling
disaster In which" scores of lives might
be lost' and- hundreds' 1 be . maimed and
injured. All* possibility of such? a ter
rible catastrophe "would' be" averted if
ho should inform the railway: company
of the signalman's physical condition.
That would, lead to hialpfompt- removal
from the sijrnal box.. Hernisrht begiv
en another: job. or he might ; be : d|s T
charged.. But- if , the doctor should in
form the company /of. the facts that had
come rto his 'knowledge In, his profes
sional capacity would; he. not be guilty
of a breach of the obligations Imposed
upon him as a physician?, -In thi3';di-"
lemma , he asked the! British Medical
Journal to .decide for him. ,
, .."Our.correspodent," cays thÂ«^editor,
"has done, his duty , by, pointing., out; to
the : patient ;his unfitness for^work, but
he would be .violating. the rule,' of f pro-,
fosslonal secrecy, if , he". communicated
to; the company' the facts 'which? have
become ", known to him sin his 1 profes
sional eapacity." ;Â«,-Whlch -amounts to
saying that; considerations of
etiquette! are of more Importance", than
the secuHty- of .railway .V passengers;
With.thlK opinion the public will hard
ly agree; The" rule, that doctors should
not â¢: disclose V what* itheirl patients -tell
them \u25a0 Is , doubtless] an excellent one { In
the vast majority" of jcases.^-- But" this
seems . to V be ' a case , in ;jw r hich V incalcu
lably greater. harm 7 may; arise from
sticking i to ;the- rule_ithahj.by. making
anÂ«exceptloh to" it. ; It would be \ inter
esting to .obtain , the i opinions of Amer
ican physicians on< the! subject. ; ~j_

He is a good writer, as well as a. good
fighter and" has produced two excellent
booksâ one dealing with small boat.sail
ing, cf which he Is a <Â£Â£3tee, and the
other describing the life of Sir George
Tryon. He has always been popular in
the eer-vice, especially with the junior
ranks, to wh<Â£n his hot-headed tempera
ment strongly appeals. His ' face is that
of a man with strong feelings. His eyes
are deep set and fierce in expression. He
is f till as full of life and vigor as a boy.
One could never imagine his settling down
to taking life easy and cultivating a cor
poration.
Another old sea dog. Admiral Sir N.
Bowden-Smith. suffers from an acute
form of German dlctemper. He has just
made the startling discovery that most
of the Teutonic waiters who swarm over
England and are especially numerous in
London, ere spies in disguise.
LONDOX, June 3.â Vice Admiral
Charles Cooper Penrose Fitzgerald, whose
article in the "Deutsche Revue" caused
such a hubbub because patriotic Teutons
regarded It as a direct threat of war by
the British Admiralty, is on the retired
list. If he were not he would at the least
have received a severe reprimand for the
indiscreet use be has made of his pen.
But one of the compensations for being
laid on the shelf on half-pay is the privi
lege of free speech, which b denied the
soldier or sailor on active service.
Admiral Fitzgerald wore the official
muzzle for many, yearsâ he entered the
service as a midshipman when only 13â
and now he is permitted to slip it off and
speak. He delights in giving vent to the
"tire in his belly," to use Carlyle'e phrase.

to pay $113,500 per annum more for

that those taxes did not include that

\u25a0 But the claims of the nephen, Hans
meyer, are not the. only trouble's "that
Mrs. Seymour has In store for her In
her attempt to retain the property left
by her <busband. For years â¢31 r. Sey
mour vras one of the partner* -of the
business of the St. George stables at
408 Bush street. Tbe other partner was
Jobn YV. Murphy. Seymour uau an In
active member of the firm and be blred
James .XV. Gregory at a salary of ?1 10
per month to do. tbe actual labor, which
he should have done had he been ac
tively fnwKfd Id the baslnexs. AH
went smoothly up to tbe time of Sey
mour's death. ' â¢ When tbe repi-ese'nta
tives of the administratrix came to take
charge of the uustneÂ«n they found that
Gresory claimed tliat the intercut was
his .through' the gift of the deceased at
the* time when the new lease to the
land iras signed, says Attorney Hjtnlon.
The . value of t this property, is $20,000
and it brinpTM In a lan^e revenue.
A peculiar feature . of Gregory's claim,
says. Hanlon, is that Seymour continued
to pay Gregory the salary, long after the
time that the latter says the business be
longed to him by gift.' . Since June,' 1904/
Gregory has remained in possession as
the owner, and the widow will now. bring
suit to eject him from "the premises. .
original Same kokdme veil
The - fact : is that Seymour's ' name was
really Kordmeyer. He came to California
in the early . day?, and : finding ' that his
name was a hard one to -pronounce 1 he
changed it to . Seymour. This was "not
done by any. process of law, but the peo
ple had known him as* Seymour for so
long, a time -that it was forgotten Uhat
his real name was something^ else. -.. \u0084
He was married in' Oakland in IS7B and
came to San - Francisco to take charge of
the ' Russ House. . While ?:, at ."â¢; Bartlett
Springs in' June, 19M, he disappeared,- and
his body was * found a' fe w : days ' later
lying in a creek. There was then trouble
over the payment -of j the ; reward i and \ it
was only /, a few months ago â¢ that ';\u25a0 the
court ordered i the â¢' administratrix to f pay
the men ''who" helped' search 3 for the re

Mrs. Seymour makes answer to all of the
claims of the German \u25a0 nepnew. She says
that the demands of Hansmeyer are all
made from fictitious promises alleged to
have been made by her husband during
his lifetime.- She denies that any one
has any right to the community property
except herself, according to the last will
of Mr.- - Seymour. She says that there
have been propositions made to her that
a compromise be effected, but these she
steadily -refuses to consider. She expects
to defend her . property until the courts
take it away from her as -a result 'of
litigation. . .

The petition" of Munroe Goldstein to
remove the executors of the'will of his
late father, Samuel Goldstein, on the
ground that they had failed* to file an
inventory and- appraisement as' pro
vided by law, had Immediate' effect.
Young Goldstein filed his petition Fri
day and early yesterday' morning the
inventory was presented at the office
of the County Clerk.
In the. inventory it is stated- that de
cedent's . estate consists of 499 C shares
of the capital stock of the ' Kutner-
Goldsteln Company, "a corporation, of
the par value of $100 a share.' The
stock,' however, has gone far above
par and is worth, according to the ap
praisement, - $624,500 at the present
time. - - : : cq.\--
\u25a0 Accompanying the inventory was a
petition of Mrs. Sophie Goldstein,
widow of the deceased, for distributku
to her. of three-fourths of the estate-
It is probable, .however, that this peti
tion will be met by a contest of de
cedent's will on behalf of Munroe Gold
stein ,and that many years of expensive
litigation will pass before the petition
for distribution is reached.
Old Caleb Rhodes, the father, and
Caleb Baldwin Rhodes both refused to
reveal anything- about the'mine,; al
though the older man made periodical
visits to it many'years ago. -, The. old
man's neighbors noted that he would
disappear from time to time and at first
supposed he v/as on hunting .trips,' but
at length. they noticed that on- his;re-,
turn he would pay his bills with nug
gets and gold dust.- ,They then began
to .watch him,' but the old man always
succeeded in throwing his followers oft
the trial' after he - entered the .reserva
tions He waÂ»i unable . : to the 'de
posits regularly,' hecause they. were ori;
an Indian reservation,! and the 'general:
belief is - that he" hastily gatheredlthe:
ore >in ;sacks ;and "'conveyed? lt\tb some

The son, after. the old man's, death,

toward the Colorado line, crossing a

the mine was located. Rhodes, Hathen-.

said to have been parties to a plan to

as the reservation was opened- this fall.

jÂ«ej-mour owned a pleÂ«*e of property
on the northwest corner of Geary and
Octavla streets, valued at 930,000, and
another on the soothwest corner of
ficary and Jones, worth 575,000. He
kept a tin box in the Union Trnst Com
pany's vaults and "alien he died this
tras opened by C \V. Hawkins, one of
the executors of the will and the per
sonal representative of Mr. Seymour
while the latter. was alive. In this box
%xa* .hidden a way a deed conveying:
this land to bin nephew, August Hani*
nicyer.. This deed, says Mr. Hanlon,
wun not known to be In existence by any
one. and the nephew did not evea dis
cover It until the box wan opened : by
the. executor*. ' There was ' no delivery
of this : deed \u25a0 nor does there seem ' to
have .been any cash paid for It, but
Hansmeyer asks that it be elven him,
n* trai the evident intention ' of Mr.
Scymonr, he say^i.
In this same box were round 800 shares
of the Spring Valley Water Company,
valued at $54,400. These are also claimed
by the; nephew. He says that Executor
Hawkins told him they were to be given
to him as soon as Seymour died. Haw
kins, it . is claimed, was given these - in
structions by ' the aged capitalist before
his eudden death.
In her report " as special administratrix
The next claim is for the sum of $50,090,
now deposited in the Bank of Califor
nia. The action was first brought against
the bank alone, but the court granted the
request of the latter to make Mrs. Sey
mour a party to the suit. This money
was placed on deposit- at the time when
the dead capitalist was about to take a
trip to the Continent and it was in the
r.ame of the deceased or V.i Kordmeyer.
Kordmeyer drew some of It out on ac
count of Seymour, and when the latter
died there was JjO.ooo left on the account.
Now, according to Attorney Hanlon,
Hansmeyer claims that he is the Kord
meyer on whose account the money was
deposited and he says that Seymour
promised the residue to him on the lat
ter's death. The promise was a verbal
one.
According to Mr. Hanlon, the first of
the series of claims made by the foreign
nephew is for the value of a note for
$40,000 due the estate from A. C. Bilicke,
the proprietor" of the Hollenbeck Hotel
of Los Angeles. It seems that Mr. Sey
mour lent this sum of money to Mr. Hoi
lenbeck from the proceeds of some land
that he bad sold. Hanemeyer claims that
Seymour bad made him a verbal promise
that he was to get this property on the
death of Seymour, and that this promise
was broken by the sale of the land to
others. To compensate him for the loss
of his prospective wealth, the nephew
says. Seymour gave instructions to BI
licke for him to pay the proceeds of the
note to Hansmeyer when It fell due. In
the meantime Seymour \ died, and when
Bilicke attempted to pay- the ->\u25a0 money to
the order of the nephew, the administra
trix secared an order from the court stop
pingr the payment until the case was set
tled under the law. Tnis is the first
claim, of Hansmeyer against the estate.
(50,000 IX THE BAXK.'
The will of Seymour gives the com
munity property to the wife. It was .made
in the presence of Attorney R. H. Lloyd.
The separate property Is given to the
three branches of the Seyraour relatives
In Germany. This part of the estate is
rot described, but the widow claims that
It Is only a Email part of the whole.
"Now," says 3ir. Hanlon, "instead of all
Â©f the foreign heirs suing on the will for
the property, this one of the seven chil
dren of one branch advances claims
which cover nearly the whole of the
estate." It is the statement of these
claims and the answers made to them
that makes up the report which the
special executrix filed with Judge Ker
rigan co highly interesting.
The report was filed with Judge Ker
rigan last night. Attorney Hanlon said
the unusual time of filing: was dne only
to tit* fact that it took longer to make
vp the statement than bad been
thought. He claimed there was no rea
son for particular haste.
A. further complication is added by
the fact that a claim is made to a half
interest in the St. George stables by
a man who was originally employed by
Seymour to look after that Interest.
Mrs. Seymour's husband was Simon 11.
Seymour, at one time proprietor, of .the
Russ House. The relative who. demands
the property is August Hansmeyer. who
was a nephew of the deceased and Is. a
citizen of Germany. His claims are, gays
Attorney Har.lon, based mainly on al
leged verbal promises made by Seymour,
who died on June 25, 1904. It is admitted,
though, that two unrecorded deeds made
out by Seymour to Hansmeyer for valu
able property were found among Sey
mour's papers.
The present value of the estate Is 5553,-

The lad refused to take chloroform,
bearing his pain like a soldier. He looked
up at the surgeon and said: "I am going
to be a prizefighter some day and I don't
care for a little pain, so go ahead and
fix me up." - . -
But Louis' dream of fame in the padded
arena may be shattered, for it is likely
he will lose his right leg. The member
was so badly crushed by .the car that the
doctors at the hospital say it will prob
ably' have to be amputated, though they
still hold out a little hope of saving it.
During all the labors of the carmen and
the fire laddies in their efforts to get him
free the lad never muttered a cry. He
was rushed to the Central Emergency
Hospital, where his wound was dressed.
As he walked merrily along Broadway
shortly after 9 o'clock last night, nine
year-old Louis Gattl was run down by a
heavy electric car and his leg pinioned
under one front wheel. So tightly was
the lad held in the* grip of the monster
vehicle that it was necessary to call out
the members of fire truck No. 3 to help
release him. The lad will probably lose
his right leg. Throughout the awful or
deal he never muttered a cry of pain.'
The boy was on his way to his home
at 914 Sansome street and did not hear
tbe car as it bore down on him. near the
corner of Stockton street. The motorman
stopped the vehicle as soon as possible,
but not before little Louis had been pin
ioned to the rail so fast it was impos
sible to move him.
When the carmen saw their efforts were
of no avail they applied to the fire laddies
for assistance. The memoers of truck No.
2 hurried to the scene of the accident and
worked for nearly half an hour before
they tucceeded in raising the car so that
Louis might be pulled out of his painful
retreat.

The members of the Automobile Club
of California â¢ will rendezvous ', I next
Saturday at Santa Crua, the Sea Beach
Hotel being their headquarters. C. C.
Moore, captain of the run, and the ex
ecutive committee of the club have Is
sued a circular to the members'.stat
ing that favorable rates have been se
cured from * the hotels and arrange
ments made for an , ample supply;, of
gasoline and lubricating .oil; as well as
for garage accommodation. ' . t '
The members .'.will reach ' Santa Cruz
by any route they may prefer. Three
roads are; available. , The \u25a0 first is by
way of Los Gatos, the Hotel de Red
wood and SoQuel, the distance by It
from Oakland being about eighty miles.
The road Is one of the best,' easiest and
most beautiful I mountain I roads in the
State, not having more than eight or
nine miles of hill and being nowhere
too steep for light-powered motor cars.
It is in fine condition and is : strongly
recommended by the committee, as
signboards, give plain directions. â¢ The
time required- from *< Oaklan d' to Santa
Cruz is not more than five or six hours.
Members are cautioned 'to 1 fio*und b their
horns \vijgorously and proceed 'slowly
on curves to give any driver approach
ing an opportunity: to turn out \u25a0.
The second \u25a0 route Is by .. way of Ban
Jose. Gilroy, ; San Juan and JYatson
vllle. . The only hills are some short
ones near San I Juan, the route passing
through the â¢ canyon:to, the north geff
San Juan grade and Joining the Pajaro
Valley near jrWatsonvllle. ' \u25a0\u25a0 From
sonville to Santa Cruz the road is in
fair condition' and comparatively level.
Those .who choose this \u25a0â¢ route - should
allow eight |or nine hours I for . the j trip.
as the distance is about< 130 miles and
a stop must be made for luncheon. ' \
'.The thlrd'route is by way of Half
moon Bay and â¢ Pescadero. . - The ; road
passes over; a' rolling country and Is. in
excellent condition with ," a .uniformly
smooth surf ace. ..The only drawback is
that . about i one jj and . ' a half \ miles "Â»jpf

Mr. Michael Lynch and Mr. Happy
Hogan had base hits stowed nway In
their bats yesterday, which they pro
ceeded to unload at Recreation Park
when stray Tigers were lingering oa
the paths. A few of the Oaklanders
were also there with some good ones,
but they overlooked the time to come
tnrough, so the Commuters went away
pointless, while tb,e Tigers grabbed
three.
Mr. Brown, who tossed up the twist
ers for the Tigers, was somewhat of a
mild surprise not only to the Oakland
ers, but to the entire contingent of
fans who were on hand to see the bat
tle. In his previous performances
here Mr. Brown never showed any
alarming curves nor did he ever com
mit the offense of blanking any ball
teams. He had everything yesterday
in the way of curves, control and pres
ence of mind. He pitched as well as
any star of the season.
Ham Iberg came out for the first
time since be was hit by a pitched ball
several weeks ago. Ham was Joyously
greeted by the multitude and twirled
clever basebalL He weakened in only
two innings, but the strain begun to
tell on him in the eighth and he went
to the bench in favor of Schmidt.
The Tigers waded In and grabbed a
couple of runs in the third. Nordyke
was safe on a boot by Francks, but
was soon caught off first by Iberg.
Truck Eagan let four bad ones go by
and McLaugnlin shot one to left field.
Lynch came up with two gone and Ham
buffaloed him into striking- at a pair
of slow ones. He tried to repeat tbe
stunt, but Lynch took a ride on the
next and away it went out to left,
scoring both men. Mike tried to make
a three-sacker out of it, but he was
pinned at third by many feet.
In the next Â£pasm the Commuters
made a bid, but fell down because no
one was kind enough to souse the .ball
at the right time. Kruger opened It up
with a bingle over second and Dun
leavy placed him up a notch by going
out. Doyle to' Nordyke. StreLb swung
through to right and Kruger. got as far
as third. Kelly might have tied up
the score, but the best he had was a
pop to Hogan, so the chance went
a-gllmmering. :.::., ,V
Truck Eagan started the Tigers on
another run pilgrimage in the seventh
by slapping- to left for two. McLaugh
lin died on the infield route and Van
Haltren grabbed Lynch's drive, so It
seemed Truck would stick at, second.
Hogan responded with a drive over
the keystone sack and Truck was
there with the other run.
The Commuters fell down again in
the sixth. This time two had been
stowed away, when Dunleavy drove one
to . . right and Strejb came right
through witir another, chasing Dun to
third. It was np to Kelly again, and
this time he : lined one at first, which
Nordyke ate up without moving a f6ot
awayw from the bag.

STANDING OF THE CLUBS.
Unless . Manager Morris Levy of tha
Hayes Valley Athletic Club changes his
mind, Jimmy Britt ; and Eddie Hanlon.
the "native sop boxers, -will be the next
pair of glove artists to appear in the ring ,
at Woodward's Pavilion. Britt signed to
meet the winner of the Corbett-Hanlon
conflict, and now stands ready to live up
to his agreement. '.
There is considerable talk^of the match
falling through because of the unsatis
factory manner in which- Friday night s
: encounter ended. But as far aa Britt la
! concerned, it still goes. He\ stated yes
terday he was ready, to live up to his
contract to meet Hanlon in , July under
the auspices of .the Hayes. Valley Club. >
1 Britt will hold out for 132 pounds at; 6
o'clock. Hanlon says he will not meet the
plumber -boy at that -weight. He insists
on 130 pounds at 6 o'clock, the weight he
made for Corbett and the weight he has
done in nearly every flght of bis career. ..
This little difficulty will probably be
straightened out without much trouble,
for the reason that Hanlon Is anxious to
get a go with Britt The latter . has the
upper hand as f ar as the dictating goes; \u25a0
and ha will hold out until Hanlon comes
to bis terms, ifor< Britt knows he cannot
do 130 pounds at 6 o'clock and enter the
ring feeling fit enough to do himself Jys
tlce. /:- .- \u25a0' '.- \u25a0:'.. " :,# 'â¢ '- '^- '
\ \u25a0 Leyy has thÂ« July, permit and Is going
j to promote some kind of a flght. He has
the signature of Battling Nelson to meet
Britt during July or August," but It looks
as though that match will never amount
to anything for the present at least, as
Nelson Is 3000 miles away with enough
easy ..money in sight to Hold him 'for a
while. -\u25a0â¢: \u25a0 - " . \u25a0- \u25a0 --:\u25a0\u25a0'.â¢â¢ \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 - V
"â¢' Abe Attell pipes out from New York his
willingness to hook up with Britt Some
of the New York sporting writers have
I even gone as far as to match Jimmy with
the boxer of the Ghetto., When- the fans
take .Into consideration the fact that At
tell demands 129 pounds at Â«\u25a0Â« \u25a0 o'clock they

'; The Brltt-Hanlon -match Is far from be-,
ing an attractive one. Jere Dunn, whb Is
one of the ; best judges of a fighter In the
country, "expressed the opinion that Britt
can lake Corbett and Hanlon in the same
night and defeat each one - Inside of ten
rounds.- ; ' ' . \u25a0Â» â¢ \u25a0; . â¢"â¢' ; ' .."
Much sympathy was expressed for Cor
betjt yesterday "at the decision of the pre
vious night/ (he consensus of opinion be
ing that a draw would have done neither
boxer an Injustice. Both" boxers were ; on
the street early yesterday and 'their faces
showed the /marks â¢of â¢ their previous
right's work ' ln ' the ring. '? If vHanlou : la !
niatch'ed with; Britt his friends wlll^ urge
him 'to spend several weeks in the moun
tains before he \u25a0 settles down to training
again. | His wonderful powers of- recuper
ation cannot last- forever. if he keeps up
the strain: without a t let up. . , .

The art, of refining sugar and . making
what is cklled. loaf sugar was invented by
a -Venetian 1 citizen toward the; end [of the
fifteenth century. The same art was first
practiced in England in 1544,' the adventur
ers being Thomas Gardiner and 'Sir' Wil T
Ham Chester,' assisted by tiiree yenetians.
They "i were "proprietors -t of \u2666> the only .'"two
sugar houses in Englarid, ; but the; profits
arising : from this concern.; were "at 'first
smallTTas -the^ sugar refiners at Antwerp
could supply- the London 'market "cheaper.
Eventually v war \u25a0 stopped ;- intercourse
between 'London; and Antwerp,'; arid these
two .supplied ; : all. England ;'for 7i a
space of twenty; years -and greatly "eni
rlched the, proprietors,, whose success in-,

All other .l sugars I beside cane sugar
and \u25a0 sugar . of milk- were unknown j until
the year; 1747,. when a German chemist
named â¢J.Margraff , first; produced _sugar
from white beet root. No practical use
was made of ; the" discovery during^ his
lifetime. HoVyever. , In '. 1799, 'his- pupil
and successor, ;/ Achard. established a
beet sugar factory.in Silesia,: soon- after
which the chemists of France, at the In-
Starice of Napoleon, largely extracted
sugar from the beet-root.-- It \ was not,
however, till after 1830 that ithe indus

1 QUEEN : ANNE'S ' SUGAR TONGS. ,;-
The J . Venetians ;were the fathers of
the European sugar. .trade. 'Anterior to
the year 1148 they' both imported con
siderable' quantities, of 'sugar, from In
dia and planted' the cane In % the island
of Sicily. With the f produce of, this
island and the Indian imports the Vene
tians carried on a great trade Jkqd sup
plied all" the markets ', of Europe with
this commodity. \u0084 However, the exact
date when -sugar was, first introduced
Into England ; is -difficult to ascertain.
One of the earliest references to. sugar
In JEnglandisthat'of 100,000. pounds of
sugar being shipped to London in i 1319
by, one Loredanao,"/. a. '-merchant >of
Venice,' to be exchanged for -wool.' , In
the -same year there. ''appears In the
accounts of the chamberlain : of Scot
land a payment at the rate of Is 9%d a
pound for sugar. "Writing .In .1380."
Chaucer .mentions \u25a0\u25a0 the sweetness "of
augar allegorlcally. , .-â¢'
SUGAR TRADE OF WEN ICE.
Few other commodities possess^ a
larger bibliography than sugar. Never
theless, the early history of sugar is
wrapped in obscurity. Formerly chem-.
ists called everythlnga "sugar" which
had a sweet taste, but. the term in its
scientific sense soon came .to be re
stricted to the sweet principles In .vege
table and animal juices. Only one of
these, cane sugar, , was known ' as a
pure substance until 1619, when an
Italian - chemist Isolated the sugar of
milk and proved its individuality." The
original habitat ':of sugarcane fs not
known, but it seems to have beeij^flrst
cultivated In China and. to have ex
tended thence to India and Arabia' afa
comparatively late date. jfi Sugar, is; not
mentioned by either Grecian or Roman
writers until the" tlriie of Nero,; and
sugar candy was the first: and 'only
species known to the European
ancients. It was the original manu
facture of the East;" particularly China,
and foun'd'its'way into Europe, as raw
sugars did in after ages, by way' of
India, Arabia and the- Red Sea.- Sugar
when first introduced "into 'every coun
try was used only medicinally.' Almost
all physicians, beginning with the Arab
leeches, employed It originally to ren
der. k unpleasant and nauseating, medi
cines grateful to the sick, and recom
mended- it in complaints of the chest
and Jungs. \u25a0
That which preserveth apples and . pluma
; Will also preserve liver and lungs
Is an old adage.. But the -use of sugar
sirups and preserves came later, while
barely three centuries have elapsed
since it became an ingredient, in the
popular diet of. Europe^ . â¢

Delegates from the University Mound
Improvement Club presented a petition
that is to be submitted to the. Board of
Supervisors, asking the i board to take
some action to open certain streets in
that district that are'now fenced in.
Prompt action in the matter is urged
on the following grounds: '
The obstructions greatly retard the
growth of that section of the city which
would * otherwise grow rapidly into a
most desirable location for homes; trie
South End' School, the only one. in the
district, is renderc-d difficult of, access
by the obstructions and the fencing in
of the streets is in violation of the law.
The petition will be circulated among
the. clubs !n tbe federation and for
warded to the Board of Supervisors. â¢

grievance against one Mrs. J. Kearney,
who has Â«. cow-shed on ' the bluff at

fiance: "Any one "who don't like, this
can go 'to"- : -V " .
. Traces of this sign, Fisher alleged,
still greet the interested passengers on

Scotland is the land of twins and trip

countries In this matter. In twelve months
no fewer â¢ than 1625 mothers gave birth to
twins and. twenry-flve presented triplets.
Scotland Is.among thÂ« few. countries, of
Europe where the- proportion of male ba
bies Is greater than females. Striking qn
avcrÂ«y?e.'ilt is found that there are about
104 Mnales to every 100 females, but-thf
surplus of grown-up girls is nevertheless
lartrc. "as so many men travel -south and
Â«p;Â»arcntly neglect to take the precaution
to obtain return tickets . to. the land of

fact about Scotland:' It is the land of hate

. W. H. CROGKER.
"I feel a great Interest in what you are doing
for the improvement, of: 'Presidio Terrace,' \u25a0 ao
beautifully located next to the'- Presidio Reser-
vation. I have noticed that such plans have
been followed in other cities, where they have
proved -universally popular; and successful â
adding to the beauty of the" residence portion
of such cities. The "scheme is a- splendid one
and its success is assured." â¢'. !
JAMES -DJ-PHELAN:
"I note with much satisfaction that you have
subdivided Presidio Terrace in a manner which
recalls the beautiful pkrk residences of other
and more progressive ciVk-s,' whose example we
may well follow. The' scheme will promote
nelghborlln.fss based en common interests, and
at the*Vame time the . grouping ; of the. houses
within the Inclosure should insure privacy and
protection. Th 6" plan seems Ideal." \u25a0
A. SBARBORO: â¢" 1 ' '"â¢
"I congratulate you upon the splendid echema
for residence plats as shown. by the plan of
Presidio Terrace". I -'have '.seen similar places
in .Europe and in some o* ties of the Eastern
States, but I believe that Presidio Terrace will
surpass them all. The location being adjacent
to the Presidio, famlUea with their children
can. stroll at their pleasure and enjoy the beaur ;
tiful view cf the bay and ocean. ' The .sunny '
exposure of the tract cannot- be excelled. â¢ Ac--

Recently there : has : beenl a- popular
agitation in England in regard to ar
senical ; beer and the ; Department ; of
Agriculture, ; recognizing the great im
portance .of the question, has made a
representative collection^ of goods pur
chasable lri the .open, market in Wash
ington, ;D.;C.;, with v the idea ; of iparn
ing the public of their danger. The
Massachusetts law ha3 l been * quite ef
fective,; in raising.; the. ; wall ; paper
standard throughout the., country- .
' Green is : by no means ; the only, ar
senic tinted paper, as some of the most
heavily.' loaded "papers 'are the reds
and 3 browns, arid in fabrics -blues and
blacks are ' often the ; most ' dangerous.
As'showing Ayhatcan be done one line
of .wall papers by \u25a0an American manu
facturer v- was examined \u25a0 "which * em
braced'tthe 5 w hole 1 field \u25a0 of ;color. 'and
was; found Â« to i contain Vnot a' trace of
arsenic ; or,< any ,; of Its '- compounds. *
..-; English manufacturers are the most
flagrant ? disregarders? of â¢ public "health
in t this ; matter. $ - 1 1 : is : surprising that
the j most > expensive papers,: as well -as
the -cheap.*, stocks. '\u25a0\u2666 contain r arsenic 1 in

sources |of | 'arsenic r poisoning. Furs

gerous.'' -'.?.'.,', ''7*-' : *Â£Â£sti@Â£3BÂ£S
Another case occurred in a Massa
chusetts , infant } t asylum, where \u25a0 the
wholesale arsenical poisoning of the
children and nurses was traced to some
blue dresses adopted" as a .uniform by
the . nurses. Much ' of the ' arsenic was
found, to be loose in ! the cloth. The
authorities had .the dresses thoroughly
washed, : thinking thereby to eliminate
the poison. \u25a0 but upon their resumption
by; the nurses there -was another out
break of .alarming "symptoms among
the babies," so that the dresses -had to
be discarded. Since then the trouble
has entirely disappeared. .;.
.;; Ten : years -ago .the use of arsenic In
colored wall papers and house furnish
ings - was common. Some official testa
In Massachusetts, at that time showed
that' one-third [of the papers examined
contained X more . or ; less of the poison
and the proportion of arsenical house
furnishings, prints and ginghams was
as great or greater. Eilk3 and woolens
.were comparatively free. ~ *
J As a result the -, Legislature of Mas
sachusetts; enacted a law j limiting the
amount of arsenic in papers and wov
*Â»en:fabrics other than, dress goods to
.10- of a grain ..to .the square yard and
the amount in dress goods and articles
of dress -to .01 grain to each square
yard,: or just one-tenth as much as
is -allowed in wall papers, owing to the
liability ": of ; fabrics * coming â¢; into inti
mate* contact 'with' ; the body.*: I

is of common occurrence that they
only auote a- few dozen i cases rout- of
the many hundred \u25a0 that have come to
their notice,: devoting. a; large part of,
the space to the . results of analysis of

H. J. Warner, assistant : chemist, Bu-*
reau of Chemistry, and "the collabora

/ i "The African likes to trade, and sends
his products, for miles from the Interior
to the coast. , It ; Is .easy to buy from
him, but no novice can -sell to him. Ha
has been trading for centuries. His wants
arid desires have been dictated by the
nature . of his environment and the cus
toms and laws of his social -life. He
knows \u25a0 at : sight what is best for him.
and the manufacturers of Europe have
made, millions -by studying his wants.
â¢When * American manufacturers turn
their attention to. West Africa they will
behold a most inviting commercial Held.
The iron pots,, brass kettles, tobacco,
steel bars, red caps, silks, cotton cloth,
gold and silver trinkets, cap and - flint
guns and many_ other "articles which are
called for by the" African must be made
for"- him 'specially.- \u25a0 â¢ . . â¢ -'
"The Germans thus far have excelled
the English in making cloth for the Af
rican, but It is my belief that the Ameri
can manufacturers can And will excel the
Germans If they ever investigate the
profits of this West African trade. Pat
terns of different articles, according to'
the wants of the ', natives, can be for
warded -through the r department when
ever they may be required. The United
StateVls surely especially fitted to en
ter upon the conquest of this great mar
ket; the opportunity, is now, and Liberia
is the ofen door."
:'- "The native , African seenres the pro
ducts of his country without much labor
or (difficulty. " When 'these products are
manufactured they command large
profits abroad. 3 ; The increasing consumpr
tion in' Europe of West Af ric-jn com
modities Is ; dependent upon the " native
African. It Is he who i secures the pias
sava, ivory, caoutchouc, , palm /oil, palm
kernels, kola nuts.; kafa seeds, hides, cas
sava, calabar beans,' cocoa .and ginger,
and , it . Is ; he .wh6 \u25a0 performs the . labor in
the steamship service lof the coast and
in the trade and trafHc and mines of the
interior. '

most, interestinsr" people In : the . world,"
says jj George r'. W.-. Ellis. ? United â¢-. States
; Charge ; dVAfTaired :, at \ Monrovia.^ Liberia."
Jn" a : recent 5 ' report, Vahd the varied and
natural i wealth of their country ]is un
surpassÂ«d. The indications are that they
will for some, time yet almost wholly
possess' West Africa. They thrive along
| the west coast ; in , millions. Although
\u25a0 armed like warriors.* they are lovers or
! peace; ! they have their > peculiar dviliia
tion and \ they i arc rich, but this wealth
is In .wives, bullocks and slaves captured
