THE BEST OF THE SHERLOCK HOLMES STORIES
THE ADVENTURE OF THE
COOPER BEECHE
ThiÂ» la tfae fourth of a aerie*
of stories b y A. - Conan \u25a0 Doyle,
d ra Hair Trlth the nd vent ureÂ» of
the fsmow detective, Sherlock
Holmes, up to the time of his
memorable Â« truÃtcle - for life
upon tbe ' Switzerland rouun>
tain path j with tbe redoubtable
Morlarlty. These are the orig
inal Sherlock Holmes stories^
nnÂ«l tbe ones which made Dr.
Doyle's fame. They are entire
ly apart from tbe series Trblch
recently appeared in tbe"'Sun
day Call entitled 'The Return
of Sherlock Holiuea."
(Copyrisht. 1905, by Harper & Brothers.)
"To the man who loves arf. for Its own
â¢ake." remarked Sherlock Holmes, toss-
Ing aside the advertisement sheet of the
Dally Telegraph, "It is frequently In Its
least Important and lowliest manifesta
tions that the keenest"- pleasure is to fee
derived. It Is pleasant to me to observe,
Watson, that you have so far grasped
this truth that in these - little records of
our cases -,whlch you . have been good
enough' to draw up, and, I am bound to
say, occasionally to embellish, you have
given prominence not so much to. the.
many causes celebres and sensational
trials In which I have figured, but rather
to those incidents which may have been
trivial in themselves, but which have
given . room for those ' faculties of * deduc
tion and of logical synthesis which I have
made my special province."
"And yet," said I, smiling, .."I cannot
quite hold myself absoU'ed â¢ from ; the
charge of sensationalists which has been
urged against my records." . .Â£;*.-â¢
"You have erred, perhaps," he observed,
taking up a glowing einderwith the tongs
and lighting with it the long cherry-wood
pip* which was wont "to replace - his
clay when be was in a disputatious rather
than a meditative mood â "you have erred,
perhaps, in attempting, to put color, and
i'fe into each of your statements, instead
of confining yourself tothe task "of plac
ing upon record that severe reasoning
from cause to effect which is really the
only notable feature about the thing.".: i
"It seems to me that I have done you
full justice in the raa'tter," I -remarkea 1 ..
with Â«omÂ« coldness, for t l y wÂ»s Jepelled by'
*ttx.* y^dsm^ Â»-ii^ if -r tod, more* than. onc<v;

'-\u25a0 *'Xd, it-is' not .' selfishness or' conceit*"
said 6e, answering, , as was": h'is" ; wont, my'
thoughts rather, than'; my words. \u0084' "If I.
claim .full Justice for my art,- it is because
It "is an impersonal thlng^a thing beyond,
-myself. Crime is common. . ' Logic>is fare;?
Therefore it is upon the logic rather than' 1
upon the crime that , you * should ' dwell. ,
Toa have degraded 1 what., should have
been a course of lectures into. a' series of.

It was a cold - morning of the - early
spring and, we rat after breakfast; on
either side of a cheery fire in \ the old '
room af Baker street. ;'"A"* thick .-f6g
rolled down between ; the nnes *of \ dun
colored houses and the opposing .win
dows loomed like dark." shapeless- blurs
through the heavy wreaths.'-' Our
gas was lit and fhone on ; the white cloth'
and .glimmer of chlna\ and; metal, '.for. 1
the table had not been cleared yjet. . Sher
lock Holmes had been silent, all the
morning, dipping continuously -into the
advertisement columns of a succession -
of papers until at last, having apparently
given up. bis search, he had. emerged in
no very sweet temper to lecture me upon
my', literary shortcomings. '.. â¢ .. :' â¢
"At thÂ« sam* time." he remarked, after
a paure, during which he had sat puffing
at his long pipe and gazing down Into the
nre. "you can hardly be open to a charge
of sensationalism, for out of these cases
which you; have been so kind as to in
terest'yourself in a fair proportion do .
not treat of -crime, in its legal sense, at
all. The*,- small matter in which I en
deavored to help \ the â¢ King of Bohemia,
the -singular ; experience of Miss Mary
Sutherland, the â¢ problem connected with
the^maa with' the twisted lip and the in
cident of â¢. the â¢ noble bachelor were all
matters which are outside , the pale of
the. law. But in avoiding the sensational,
I fear that you \ may - have bordered on
the â¢ trivial." : -3Â§KÂ£f
"The end may have been so," I an
swered, "but the } methods; I hold to have
been novel/and. of Interest." <..
"Pshaw,"'" my. 'dear fellow.v what do the
public, the great unobservant public/ who
could harly tell a weaver by his â¢ tooth
or "a compositor by his' left thumb, \u25a0 care
about the > finer shades -of analysis and ;
deduction! "i But, Indeed. . if you are trivial,
I cannot blame, you. for.-the days'ofj the
great cases are past. Man, -or least
criminal man, has lost all enterprise^ and
originality. As to my ' own illttle. prac
tice, it seems to be degenerating" Into* an .
agency â¢ for â¢ recovering lost lead ' pencils
and giving advice to young ladles from
boarding-houses. I think \u25a0 that ' r I have
touched bottom at last, however." /This

months. There' is i.{ Eomethlng distinctly

"Danger! What danger do you fore-*
Eec?" v ; / '{ \u25a0\u25a0 â¢ -
Holmes shook -his head ; gravely. "It
would cease to be a danger if we could :
define it," said he. -"But at any time, day
or night, a telegram would bring me
down to yeur help."
â¢ "That is enough." She rose, briskly
from her chair with the anxiety all swept
from her face. "I shall go down to
Hampshire quite easy in my mind now.
\u25a0VI shall write to' Mr. Rucastle^at once,
cacrifice my. poor hair to-night and -start
for Winchester to-morrow." with a
few grateful words to Holmes she bade
us both good night and bustled off upon
her way. - ;
"At least," said I. as we heard her.
quick, firm step descending the stairs,
"she seems to be a young lady who is
very well able to take care of herself."
"And she would need to be," said
Holmes gravely, "for I am much mis
taken If we do not hear from her before
many days are paEt."
It was not very long before my friend's
prediction "was -fulfilled. A fortnight went
by. during which I frequently found my
thoughts turning in her direction; and
wondering what strange side-alley of
human experience this lonely woman had
strayed Into. The unusual salary, . the
curious conditions, the light duties, all
pointed to something abnormal, ..though
whether a fad or a plot; or whether the
man were a philanthropist or a" v-illain,
it was 1 quite beyond my powers to de
termine. As to Holmes, I observed that
he sat frequently for half an hour on end,
with knitted brows . and an abstracted^
air, but, he* swept the matter away with,
a wave of his hand when I mentioned
it. "Data! data! . data!" he cried im
patiently. "I can't make bricks ' without
clay." And .yet he would always wind
up by , muttering that no sister of his
should ever have accepted such \u25a0 a - sit
uation. . ' . - : ' â¢ ' .
The telegram which we eventually re
ceived came late one night, just â¢as I
was thinking of turning In and Holmes
was settling down to one of those all
night chemical researches which he fre
quently indulged in. when I would leave
him stooping over a retort and test tube
at night and find him in the same posi-,
tion when I came down to breakfast in
the morning. He opened the yellow en
velope, and then, glancing at the.mes
sage, threw it across to me.
"Just look up the trains in Bradshaw,"
said he, and turned back to his < chemical
studies.
The summons was a brief and urgent
one:
"Please be at the Black Swan Hotel
at Winchester at midday to-morrow," it
said. "Do come! .1 am at my. wits' end.
"HUNTER."
"Will you come with me?"."-a sked
Holmes, glancing up.
"I should wish.to."
"Just look it up, then."
- ' "There Is a train at half-past ."nine."
said I, glancing over rriy Bradshaw. *'It
Is due at Winchester at 11 :SO." ;'
"That will do very nicely- Then per
haps I had better postpone my, analysis
of the acetones, as we may need to be
at our best in the morning." .
By eleven o'clock the next day, we were
well upon our way to the old English
capital. Holmes had been buried, in the
morning papers all the way down,'- but
after we had passed the Hampshire bor
der he threw them down and began"- to
admire the scenery. It was an .' ideal
spring day, a light blue sky flecked with
little fleecy clouds drifting j^ross- from
west to cast. The sun was shining very
brightly, and yet there was an exhilar
ating nip in the air which set an edge
to a man's energy. All over the country
side, away to the rolling hills; around
Aldershot. the little red and gray roofs
of the farm-steadlngs peeped out froni
amid the light green of the new foliage."
"Are they not fresh and beautiful?" I
cried with all the enthusiasm of a man
fresh from the fogs" of Baker street. .
But Holmes shook his head gravely. ;
VDo you know, Watson," said he; "that
It is one of trie curses of a mind with
a turn like mine that I must look at
everything with reference to my own
special subject. You look at these scat
tered houses and you are impressed, by
their beauty." I look at them, andCthe
only thought which comes to me Is a
feelir-s of " isolation and 'of the impunity
with which crime may be committed
there."
'"Good heavens!" I cried." "Who would
associate crime with these dear old home
steads'"
' "They always fill me with a" certain
.horror. It is f my belief, Watson, founded
upon my crperlence, that the lowest and
vilest alleys in London .do not . present
a n-rre dreadful record of tin' than does
the smiling and beautiful countryside."
"You horrify me !"
"But the reason is very, obvious. The
pressure of_ public opinion can \u25a0do - in
the t^own what the law cannot accom
plish. There is no lane so vile that
the scream of a. tortured child-.or r the
thud of a drunkard's blow {does not
beget sympathy arid indignation among
the neighbors, and then the whole-ma
chlneryof justice is ever : so close that
a word of complaint can. set- it going:,
and there is but a step between -the
crime and the dock. But look at these
lonely houses, each in Its own fields,
filled â¢ for the most : part with poor," ig
norant folk who knowjlttlebf the law;
Think 1 of the. deeds, of hellish cruelty,
the hidden wickedness .which may go
on, t year In. year out, in * such places,
and none the wiser. Hadthis lady "who
appeals to us for help: gone" to live in
Winchester I should never have had a
fear for; her. -It Is the five miles' of
country.; which' makes the danger. Still,
it is clear that she is riot personally
threatened."
"No. If she can com* to Winchester
io meet us she can get away." .
"Quite so. She has her freedom."
"What can be the matter, ;then?{ Can
you sugrgest no explanation?" '.;>; â¢
"I have 'devised 'seven . separate^ ex-[
planations". each of which would 'cover'
the facts -{ as ; far as we know,: them;
But which: of these is correet{can only
be {determined by" the fresh irif ofm'ation â¢

Ccpyi-isli!. "305. by Bobbs-Mcnill Company.
I ORGANIZED under Woodruff a corps,
of about thirty traveling agents.
Each taaii knew onfy his own du
ties, knew r.othing of the general
* plan, not even that there was a
general plan. Each was a tiained
political worker; a personal retainer of
ours. I save- them their Instructions;
Woodruff equipped, them with the ncceÂ«
*ary cash. Durins the next five months
they were incessantly on the ?oâ dealing
with our party's western machine:; where
they could: setting-up rival machines in
promising localities where Goodrich con^
trolled the- regular mjrciiine*; using
money here, diplomacy there, both yon
der, promises -of patronage everywhere.
Such was my department of sserecy.
At the head of my department of pub
licity I put De Milt, a sort of cousin of
Hurbanks and a newspaper man. He at
tended to the subsidizing of news agen
cies that supplied thousands of country
papers with boiler-plate matter to fill
their inside pages. He also subsidized
and otherwise won over many small
town organs of the party. Fur
ther, he and three assistants wrote each
, week many columns of "boom" matter.
;ill of which was carefully revised by
Burbank himself before it went out 'as
â¢s-yndicute letters." If Goodrich hadn't
been ignorant of conditions west of the
AUephanies and confident t'xit his will
was law. he would have scented out this
department of publicity of mine and so
would have Fecn into my "flotation."
Bat he". knew- nothing beyond his routine.
I once asked him how many country
newspapers there were in the- United
States, and he sai<t: _ "Oh. I don't know.
Perhaps three or' four thousand." Even
had I enlightened- him ti the extent, of
tailing him that -there were about five
ilrnes that number, he would have prof
ited nothing. Had he been able to see
tlsft importance of such a fact to capable
!â¢â¢ "tiral ir.anagrement. ho would have,
learned it lons before through, years of
ctms.tant- use of the easiest avenue into'
Jho. hrarC-of the people.
He <1W iw>t wake up to adequate. action
until the fourth of that group of States'
who.-c delegations* to our national ! con
ventions, were habitually bought aji#
sold, broke its agreement with him and
instructed its delegation to vote for Bur
bank. . liy the .time he had a corps of
accnts in those Staus, Doc Woodruff
had "acquired" more than a hundred
delegates.' ; Goodrich was working only
through the regular machinery or j the
party and was fighting against a ; wiue
s-prcad feeling that Cromwell ' shouldn't,
and probably- couldn't, be elected; we,
<m the other hand, were manufacturing
presidential sentiment for. a candidate
who was alrady popular. Nor had Good
rich much advantage over us with the
regular machines anywhere except in the
East.
Just. as I was congratulating myself
that nothing could happen to prevent our
triumph at the convention Roebuck tele
graphed me to come to Chicago. I found
uith him in the 6 lttlng-rocm cf his suite j.i
the 'Auditorium* Annex Partridge and
Granby. next to him the most important
members of my combine, since they were
the only ones who had interests that ex
tended into nrany States. It was after
an uneasy \u25a0, silence that Granby. the
uncouth one of the . three, said :
"Senator, we brought you here to tell
you this Burbank nonsense has gone
far enough."

.Mutiny.
It was ail I could do not to show my
astonishment and sudden fury. "I don't
understand."./ said I, in a tone which I
somehow managed to keep down to tran
quil Inquiry.
But I did understand. It instantly came
to me tha( the three had been brought
â¢ into line for Cromwell by their powerful
h'j?lnc-Â£S associates in Wall streetâprob
ably by tho great bankers who loaned
them money. Swift upon the surge of
anger I had suppressed \ before it flamed
at the surface came a surge of triumphâ
which I a!fO f suppressed. I had often
wished, perhaps- as a * matter of personal
pride, just this opportunity; a-nd^ here it
vra*;! /!\u25a0:..
L "Cromwell must be nominated," said
â¢ } Granby in his insolent tone. He had but
two tonesâ the insolent and the cringing.
"He's safe and sound. . Burbank Isn't
trusted in "'.the! East.! And we didn't like
his conduct last year. He caters to the
demagogues." * "V
Roebuck, throygh his Hking_ for. me I
imagine." rather than through refined : in :
Ftirict. new bepan to speak, thinly dis
guisins'his! oredrs as requests. I -waited
untilhe had talked hims?!f out. I waited
with the same air of calm attention un
tiS Partridge had piven me his- jerky
- variation. I wafted, still Apparently calm;
until the filtnc? must have b<en extremity _
uncorrifcrtiiblc to them. T waited ; until-
Granby said ' sharply, "Then it. is/set
t!cd?" . " 1
"VrE.". raid 'I. keeping all emotion out
â¢ f inj' face and vo'ee. "It is /settled/^

oulbreak. However. I shall af once take '
rncasur*Â»s to prevent Us -occurring again.
, Good- day." *
And I TTa s poneâ straight â¢' to the train. ;
I. did not pause at Fredonia butwentfen,

the Ltgislatutt- and the Attorney General

I refused to be until the afternoon
of the fourth ~dJ^', and then I forbade
Granby. But when I: descended to the
reception-room"- he rushed at me,.! tried
to L takb 4 my hand,; pouring out 3 a.' stream
of : sickening < apologies. I rang the bell:
When a servant appeared, I said, "Show

Oranby turned * white . and. after a long
look into my face, said in a broken' voice
l<Â» Roebuck: "For -God's " sake,^ don't go
bark on me, Mr.' Rdebuck. Do what-you
can for mo." .
As tho curtain dropped behind him. I
looked expectantly at Roebuck," sweat
ing, wSth fright for his imperiled millions.
ProbabJy his mental state . can , be ; fully
appreciated only by a* man who has also
felt the dread of losing the wealth upon

"What tilt.' you' intend?" I interrupted

They looked <- nervously, each at the
other, then at me. "If. you think Bur

"why, you may 50 ahead â ''.}-â¢:
There burst in me such a storm of,
anger that 1 dared not V^peak "until" I
could control and aim the :- t explosion.
Partridge s:a\? how," and how. seriously,;
Roebuck had blundered.-;. He' thrust ,hinv
u^ide and faced me. "What's the use' of

ly. "We've made -damn fools .of our
selves. Senator. We thought we had vthe

A ! Victory ' for the People.
I arrived *at ' Chicago the day before the
eo~nvention_aTid; - going at once ;to our
State headquarters in -the North
ern, shut myself 'in with Doc" Woodruff.
My doorkeeper,* the member of the Legis
lature from JFredonia,;; ventured, to inter
, rupt with the announcement" that a" mess
enger, had 'come . from Senator Goodrich.
"Let: him in,*" -said I.
As the ' . doorman disappeared Doc
Woodruff glanced at his watch, then said
with a smile:* "You've ; been! here ' seven
minutes and a halfâ just .time for a look

Dufour had introduced "\u25a0\u25a0 himself : ; and! we :

cided Â» that.'* if rl ' should succeed " in '.noinl

teis and himself by nominating: as the op
position^eandidatea man under their and

'Beckett,' Â«the subtlest and most influen
tial ,of the "of , the! national, ma- *'
chine ~of \u25a0 the '^opposition â¢ party, submitted
several names to him. He -.selected
Henry J. Simpson/ Justice of the Supreme
Court of 'Ohio-^a slow.- sby.vultra-con
; servative -.inari, : his brain spun * full -1 In *
every cell .with the cobwebs of ! legal tech
nicality^ He -.was, l in his way,*, almost as
' satisfactory ;\u25a0 aY candidate - for sthe ; inter
ests as : Cromwell would have been.
: while / he was honest, "of " what.: value \u25a0 la
honesty when combined with .credulity
and ' lack : of .knowledge of affairs?,. They
knew what advisers he would select, men
trained , In their service and - s taken , from
their.* legal staffs. \ They knew-, he would
shrink : from anything : "radical" or * "dis
turbing?âthat is. would not : molest the
two packs 'of wolves. '\u25a0> the business; and
the political, at their "fcaat> upon the pub
lic. He came of a -line "of .bigoted .adher
entsof his party: he" led a simple, retired
'life /among sheep and cows.* .;. He".woree ".wore
old-fashioned ; rural whiskers. s . thickest in
the throat,' thinning" toward the jawbone,
scant; about the \u25a0: lower lip.'- absent â¢\u25a0 from

to cope with- up-to-date tcoruption' seemed
to endear him to the inasdC3.j
-. As soon'as those big. organs- of'.the op
i positionthat were in- the control, of the
powers began to talk of Simpson as an
ideal candidate," I suspected what ' was
In -the wind. But I had my hands full:
the "most 1 ; could -then do was 'to _ supply
my \ local -. "left-bower." - SiUlman. \u25a0 with
funds ; and set him to work for* a candi
date for his party _ more *to my taste. 1 It
was fortunate for me that I had cured
"* myself 'of the . habit of worrying. ,"! For it
was : plain \u25a0 that, if . Goodrich and Beckett
- succeeded ; In getting 'Simpson \ nominated ,
'by .; the": opposition.. I shouldrhave- a -hard
flght. to â¢ raise the. necessary -campaign
money.' The large interest-* either would
"finance Simpson * or, ! should \u25a0; I ..convince)

purposes ; as Simpson, would ; be " indiCCer-^

1 wrong things." 1 and "capable ".- of anything
in ' furthering- themâ after the ! manner of
fanatics. If he had not * been :in public
life,. he would. have been a camp-raeetlns

While Goodrich's agents and Beckett's
agents were industriously arranging the
Eastern machinery of the opposition
party for. Simpson, Jierriweather had Sll
liman'fi men tolling in the West and South
to get Rundle delegates or uninstructed.
delegations. And, after our conversation.-.
*.c was reinforced by Woodruff and euch
men of his staff as could be used without
suspicion. Woodruff himself could per
meate' like an odorless gas; you knew he
was there only by the results. Nothing
could be done for Rundle in his own
State: but the farther away from, his
home our men got. the easier it was to
Induceâ by purchase and otherwise^ â the
politicians of his party to* think well of
him. This the more because they regard
ed Simpson as a "stuff" and a "stiff"â
and they weren't far wrong. .' '
"It may not be â¢ Scarborough,
and it probably won't be Rundle,"
Woodruff said in his final re
port .to me, "but it certainly .won't be
Simpson. He's the dead one,- no matter
how- well he does on the first ballot."
But I would not let him give me the
detailsâ the story of shrewd and slippery
plots, stratagems, surprises. "I am worn
cut, mind and body." said I in apology
- for. my obvious weariness and indiffer
ence.
. For six months I had been incessantly
at work. The tax upon memory alone,
to say nothing of the other faculties, had
)been crushing. Easy as po'ltlcal facts
always were for me. I could not lightly
bear the strain of keeping constantly in
mind not merely the outlines, but ateo
hundreds cf the details, of tho political
oipanizations of forty odd States with all
ttieir counties. And the tax on memory
vat probably the least. Then added to
ail my political -.work was business care;
for while I was absorbed in politics, Ed
Ramsay had badly muddled the business.
Nor had I, like Burbank and Woodruff,
the power to cnipty my mind as I touch
ed the pillow and so to ' get eight hours
of unbroken rest each night, -
Woodruff began asking me for instruc
tions. But my judgment was uncertain,
and my Imagination barren. "Do as you
think best." said I. "I must rest I've
reached my limit"â my limit' of endur
nnc<Â» of the sisrhts and odors and be
foulings of these sewers Of. politics .1
must In i>erson adventure ..in order to
reach my goaL I must pause and rise
to the Eurfate for a breath of \u25a0 decent
air or I should not* have the strength to
finish these menial, and even vile, tasks
which no- man. can escape if he is a
practical leader in the practical activities
of practical life. â
CHAPTER XVIIL
A Dangrerous Pause.
I took train for my friend Sandys' coun
try place near Cleveland, forbidding
Woodruff or Burbank or my secretaries
to communicate with me.' Sandys had no
Interest in politicsâ his fortune, was in
real estate and therefore did not tempt
or force him into relations with political
machines.
Early In the morning after my arrival
I got away from the others, and with a
stag hound who remembered me"- with
favor from my last visit; struck into the
woods, that had never been despoiled by
man. As I tramped on and on my mind
sek<?med to revive and I tried to take up
the plots and schemes that had been allr"
important ye3terday. But I could not. In
stead, as any sane man must when be
and nature are alcne and face to face, 1
fell to marveling- that I coulii burn up
ay self. 'the. best of me, the best years of
my one life, in such a fever of folly and
fraud ai this political career of mine. 1
seemed to be in a lucid interval between
paroxysms of insanity. I reviewed . the
men and things of jmy world as one re
calls the absurd and repellent visions of
a nightmare. I shrank from passing from
this mood, of wakefulness and' reason
back Into the unreal reality of what had
for years been my all-in-all. I wandered
hour, after hour, sometimes imagining
that I was flying from the life I loathed,
again that somewhere In these cool,
green, golden-lighted mazes I should find
âmy U">st youth, and her. For how could
I think of It without -thinking of her
also? It had T>een lighted by her: it had
gone with her; it lived in memory. Mu
ni ined by. her.
The. beau tifu 1 .. beautiful world-that
ought-to-be! The hâ eous, .the horrible
vrorld-that-is! , ' . ;
I did not return to the house .until a!- i
rr.CEt 'dinner time, "I have to Â«ro away to- ;
morrow morning," I announced after din
ner. For I felt that if I did not fly. at
tmee I shouW lose all. heart for the task \u25a0
which must Tr>e" finished.
"Why,", protested Sandys, "you came
to stay until we all staiti?d with you for ;
St. Louis."
"I must go." I repeated. I did not dare ;
to invent.' an excuse; I could not give
the reason. Ha<l I. followed my j impulse *
I should have gone at. once, that nighty
By. nocn the- next day I had again
flung myself into the vexed political ocean
whose incessant. buffetings give the swim
mers rjnail chance to think of anything
beyond the .next- oncoming wave. .

I wes almost master of myself again
.when, a week later. I got aboard Â»~ecar
in which Carlofla asd I were taking our.
friends to look on at the "opposition's con-*'
ventfon at St. Louis. ,
" When we' arrived. .1 went- at t once to
confer 'with Merriweather in a , room " sxV
the " Southern ' HotcL* which no] one ; knew

over, five hundred delegates," * was -his
a: s=t Item of good news. "It takes six hun

VAnd. Scarborough?" 1 asked, svonder-
'lng at my indifference to this foresha
dowing of triumph.
\u25a0 "My * men ; talk \u25a0 him to - every I incoming

:; My wife and our friends and I dlned> <:
at the Southern that .night., "As 'we
were about to ; leave -the:; streets -began^
to fill. And : presently/ithrough; " the '\u25a0'.'\u25a0
close-packed masses came at a" walk an -\u25a0
open carriage â the "storm "center.? of 'a'
roar that almost drowned the s musk>6t^
the four or iflve bands.i^The
lights made, the scene lbria;ht'asiday.^'?
; "Who is her." asked' the woman at my i
sideâ^Mrs.- Sandys. -.-;/: '.- ":'.'\u25a0-'â¢
/She was looking at; THE man in > that *
carriage â there were four.: but ; there
was no mistaking him. He was seated, \u25a0
was giving: not the slightest heed to
the cheering throngs. : His \Boft , black ;
. hat was pulled well â¢ down \' over his
brows; his handsome profile was stern, ;
las face pale. If that crowd had ; beenv
hurling curses at him and' preparing:' to
tear him limb from limb he ;would notf
have looked. different. He Avas smooth-K
shaven, which made him' seem r younger
than I knew him to-be.; .And'over;him'- ;
the glamour of the world-that-'ougrht
to-be in which he lived and- had the:
power to compel others to live as. loner
as they were under the spell of his. per-"
sonality.
"That," I replied to Sandys, "is ~
Senator Scarborough "of Indiana.'.',
"What's he so stern about?" . ,
. "I'm sure I don't "knowâperhaps to
hide his. joy," said I.
But I did know, and my remark was ;
the Impulsive, filng of â¢ envy. .He had
found out, several weeks . before, what
a strong undercurrent was running;^
toward him. He was faced -by a;.*di
lemmaâif he did not ' go to , the coriveri- .,
: tlon it would be eald that he had stayed .
away deliberately, and he would -be :
nominated;, if he. went, to try^to, pre
vent his nomination, the enthusiasm of
his admirers- and followers' would glrve '
the excuse* for forcing the nomination
upon him. And as he sat there, "with 'â¢"-'
that ominous tumult about him, he,was
realizing how hard his task was to be.
His companions pushed him. a: pas- ,
sage through the crowds on: the. side-";
walk and in the lobby, ,and: he'shtit
himself away in the. upper part
of the hotel. When he left,,
half "an" hour later,- the â¢â¢'peopl^
were packed before": that face of \u25a0" the:'
hotel which displayed the banner of the
\u25a0 Indiana, delegation. . were -cheering
Scarborough, were clamoringâ in vain
â for him to show himself. â¢
"But won't he offend them?" asked .
ray wife. - \u25a0 ' ;. .
"A crowd loves like a woman,", said
1. "'lndifference' only , it."- , '-_' '\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0:;:,
"Oh, I never loved that way," pro-,;
tested Mrs.. Sandys. , \u0084- \u25a0 V
"Then." said my wire, rather, sourly ~
I thought, "you and, Mr. Sandys have
something to live for."' ' ' / .-\u25a0
And so we. talked no more -politics. \u25a0
There may be American â¢ women ; who

K.^ntinii^ X*tt 6vtn\lt\;\>ONE of the surest signs of the ap- j
proach of autumn is the change
in the styles of hats. The
milliners have already removed
the straw hats of summer from
their windows. and are exhibiting
in their Diace the felt and velvet hats
appropriate for the* coming season. But
the pretty light straw hats, with their
bright flowers, are n<-t to be given up
without a sharp pans of regret, although
change and novelty always offer some
compensation.
If we look eagerly and carefully at
the artistic creations that are shown in
borne of the large plate glass windows,
there will be a general feeling of de
lighu not wholly unmixed with awe
and wonder, at the new styles. The
peculiar shapes of tjje new fashion of
hats do really inspire the feeling of
awe, and then we wonder if we can
really bring ourselves to wear such
very queer looking headgear.'
But it will be of no sort of use to
set our faces against fashion â the odds
are too great against us. We shall, out
of curiosity, if nothing else, .walk into
the parlor oO the milliner, as the fly
walks into the parlor of her cordial and
enticing friend, the spider, and it will
be only a. short time before we are
fairly caught in the net that is spread
out for us, or as George Ade expressed
it, we are sure to be "stung."
It is not at all unusual for ladies
/.o spend a whole morning' or after-
roon In the selection and purchase of
& hat, and even then, "in spite of the
pains taken to secure the right thing,
it- may prove not to their liking, and it
must so back to the shelves again.
The real and- becoming hats may not
be reached for days.
It always has seemed to me much
easier to select a hat in Paris than
here. The styles seem prettier, al
though they must necessarily be the
eaxne that we have here, but there is
a Parisian touch that gives a certain
charm that is hard to find anywhere
tlse. And that fascinating touch Is by
no means confined to expensive hats.
The cheaper hats are just as daintily
trimmed. In fact, the twenty-five franc
hat stores are distinctly alluring-,"
wbere all hats are only five dollars
each. There are a good many of these
five dollar hat stores, and very attrac- '
tive hats are to be found In them. /
A week ag*o I had a letter from
Paris describing 1 some of the new styles
of hats, which "evidently had not yet
arrived here.' Of course they will come
âthe fashions always do come sooner
or later, though generally later.
From the description of the theater
hat. It must'be.a' very queer object in
deed, although very comfortable and
i jaunty. The model seems to be the cap
41 worn by Tommy Atkins, the } British
1 soldier boy, but adorned with a huge
plume of some kind oÂ» one fide. It is
tlien perched on the head at a fearful
and dangerous angled However, as this
hit has not yet put in an - appearance
here, we do not have to worry about it
now.
Hats are subject to the same change
able decrees of fashion as all other art
icles of drtss, and every season,' or
nearly every" season, we have a new
fashion "Â»Â» hats Just as we have a new
fashion in sleeves. This year the
fashion of liats, like the fashion of
sleeves, has gone backward "about, ten
years, but it is to Un hoped that the
march of- fashion in hats will not Â£o,too
far back. If it gets vay back into old
en times, as'far back as say, Marie An
toinette's time,: there will be a great.
<Jea!-of troublel Hats, in those days',
were "fearfully and wonderfully made,"'
as I have seen in a quaint old book that
i picked up the other, day.- .
The illustrations that were given" of
the hats worn by the- ladies of. Marie
Antoinette's court can only^ serve/ as a
fearful warningâ -a fashion to _\u25a0 be"
fckipptd. One of them, which it is true
was one of the most exaggerated of the
lot. was., a ."- ' tnlniaturo three-masted
schooner.' in; full rig. set on top of v
fctcaw crown, and. wonr on top of \u25a0" an
elaborately wavy - and curled " wig. His
tory does not tell us how this structure
k^as secured to the. h<sad, and it sug-
the query, Wero hat-pins in vogriie
in those days? The, appropriate /form '
of hat pin would Kirn tit he a/ssoldan
chor. Lut this Is nu-rÂ« conjecture.
I: is certain, however. .that -buch^ things:
THE NEW FALL HATS
\u25a0 - -v \u25a0
were actually worn in' those days, and if _
fashions always repeat themselves, we
may be : terrorized into just â¢â¢^uch un- .
wleldy and 'ungraceful objects one." of
these days. / . . .: \u25a0'.;\u25a0 y
The present polo hats, which, are. so
much worn now, - are : quite a faithful re
production of the hats of forty years ago.
I saw very recently a photograph of three
young ladies of \u25a0 San Francisco, all of
whom, were wearing polo hatsâ though, as
polo was not played in those days, they
were r.ot then known as polo hats. It;was
a very pretty picture of three very pretty
girlsâ Miss McMullin enow Mrs. Milton -
Latham), Miss McNulty (now Mrs! Thur
low""- McMullin) and Miss Maxwell, who
has since died. -
\u25a0 The coming -hats are gradually growing,
more and mo.re elaborate, and the quality
of the material, whatever it may.be,
whether velvet or. lace, is becoming more
and more impo*Ttant. : This year the hats
are ? unusually handsome, though -they
are not so extreme as they were last
year in some particulars. The big' hats/
are not so big, at all events they, are hot
so exaggerated, as they .were. In fact,
the small hats are still i*6pular, although '
milliners are . rebelling against them and
loading them down with plumes and
trimming to give the effect of large, hats."
_Picture* hats will no; doubt continue to
be worn this year, though they are cer
tainly smaller than they <_have, been.; and ,
o this." to my mind, is an improvement.
The French hats are how: made in 'quite
fantastic shapes. The hat frame is bent,
In all possible' ways, especially -in .those
of a narrow front and â¢; right side brim, â¢ ,
.and also in those .with an extremely wide
. back. jSSsii - . â¢\u25a0\u25a0 /\u25a0 ,- : ..." /-':.' v'
Hats like these are very hard . to wear, ..
as the hair must be dressed expressly for
them, an art in which French , women
excel.: The - hair have to be.ondulee
and dressed high on.the head with a puff
.In the back. The hairdresser will, fit the
hat- to \u25a0 the head, and will \u25a0 pin" on^a .bit â¢'â¢
of false, hair whenever it is required.
Althoushthe final effect' of these efforts .
may be very artistic, yet the process.re
quires more time than the average Am- t
erican .woman will 1 care to -devote to _ It.
% Besides i this, such . a . coiffure /will prove ,
to be too elaborate* an affair .for every-"
day .use. ./-..

worked his -way \u25a0 through the university ,

ently I saw, them looking at me, one
after the other; then they all lookÂ«d
at meâ and at that moment I felt what
was coming. The first suggestion of
"the thing that has happened entered
my mind. ..

told me I hadn't,. but-I told them I had.
That I hadn't thought of being a can
didate, that 1 wasnH ready to take an
office, that I had my own future co
think of. that I must have time to ,
think it over and a chance to see my
mother and talk it over with her.
"They -wouldn't give, me time to go
out and see 'my mother, but I went
away "anyhow and came over her* to
my " office* to , have a quiet moment to
myself. - Then they called me up on tha
telephone'and I went back.

j trying to explain the conditions he. Insists
upon, "if 1 can't take that office with no

v PALATIAL .SUSTAINED
THL. aays ol ' extreme republican
simplicity in the homes of United
States envoys abroad have passed.
The economic shabbiness which
formerly caused many a lip to curl
\u25a0with contempt at foreign courts exists
no longer, as Uncle Sam's diplomatic rep
resentatives are now housed as , sumptu-
J ouÂ«ly as are these cf any other nation.
Entertaining by public officials abroad
Is quite conducive to the good will of na
tions, as similar courtesies between irttli
vicluafs are to good business relations.
For instance, the acquisition of the beau
tiful KJeinmichel palace in St. Petersburg
by Oeorge yon Lengerke Meyer un
doubtedly brought the growing impor
tance of the United States .as a world
power more forcibly, before the eyes of
the ruling classes -in Russia and cer
tainly . was ' not without its influence In
facilitating President Roosevelt's efforts
to induce the Czar's Government to treat
for peace with Japan.
Of ftll the Amtncan Embassadore who
have thus enhanced the dignity and im
portance of their country in . the . minds
of foreigners.- Whitelaw^ Reid/ 'envoy
to the Court of St. James, has the most
palatial residence and is in the best posi
tion to entertain even royalty. It was Mr.
Reid who first set the example of renting
princely houses In IS9O, when as f Minister
to 1 France he ' leased the i famous * Paris
residence of the Comte de^ Grammont,
on the corner; of the avenue Hoche - and
the rue Beaujon. a beautiful palace which
was. some years later, taken at -the JÂ«?x
penEC.of the French Government for the
use of the King of Slam during- his - so
journ in the capital. Now Mrl. Reid,: like
many mfmbcrs of the British aristocracy,
has two mansions, onÂ« In town and; the
other in the country for occupancy" during
the winter When London is dark //and;

(""T"^ HE tramp leaned, over ..the gate.
I looking at the trim garden and tbe
I homely little one-story cottage. The
I placts was perl^ps an acre in ex
tent, and the cottage seemed very
small for the size of the grounds.
A little girl approached, looking won
derlngly at him. but her shrinking from
him caused no resentment in the tramp's
mind, for he was used to It. He accosted
her in a whlningVoice:
"Who lives here, little girl?"
"Aunty Mehitable and Aunt Euph*
xnia." she answered, gazing at him with
surprise in her eyes, amazed that ho
asked what every one was supposed to
know. Then she ran away as fast as she
could, and the tramp, after watching her
Jlijrht. opened the gate and entered the
garden. â¢
The two old ladies were sitting on the
veranda when the tramp came around to
them, paying he was in search of work,
which was not true, and that he was hun
gry, which was.
The old ladies bustled about to get
something for him to eat, and such a
dainty little meal th^v spread the
tramp never before sat down to. Then,
they swayed back and forth in their rock
ing-chairs and gazed at him with a satis
faction no less complete than his own,
gratified to think that presently there
would be one hungry man the less In the
world. And they questioned him. one in
terrupting the other in eagerness to elicit
the pathetic story of his life.
Pathetic, indeed, it was. for the man.
Ik ing utterly unhampered by truth, was
thereby enabled to furnish them adorned
tution that went straight to their tender,
unworldly hearts. He was a ''mechanic.
He hid been thrown out of work through
iio fault of 'his own, all on account of
hard times. He had tramped and tramped
searching for a job, and often* oh. how
often, had been tempted to steal; but
when about to do so the precepts of his
childhood forced themselves on his mem
ory, and he said, "No, I'll starve first."
Consequently he starved.
When he sat back, unable to eat a mor
sel more, the two women consulted to
gether fur a few moments, standing at
the end of the veranda and talking- in
whispers. At last they came forward
again, and Miss Mehitable, being pre
sumably the elder, was spokeswoman.
"If you think you could work in the
garden," she said, "we might give you
something to do. We can't pay much;
but ycu will have plenty to cat and a
comfortable place to sleep in the out
house. What do you say?"
Now, of a.l things on earth that the
tramp wanted work was the very. last.
Still, circumstances over which he had no
control, at tbe present moment, made it
strictly necessary that he should lie low
for a while, and this spot was about. the
safest place he could choose; no one
would think of looking for him in such a
remote corner. He glanced .over the
peaceful garden and pondered awhile be
tore replying.
."Well, mum," he said at last. "I don't
s-o much care about wages as I do about
a safe home and good victuals. I'm not a
great hand at gardening, being used to
cfty work mostly; but things got a bit
livelyâ that Is, trade was dull, and so I
thoughtâ wellâ l'll do my best. If you
fehow me : how."
"That is all any one could ask," said
lbt two in the same breath. " -
â¢"I'd like to get another suit of clothes,"
hf continued, looking down at his torn
garments, "but I'd rather not go into the
village after them. I've been used so cru
cny by folks that I don't exactly care
about anybody seeing me but yourselves,
and I'd kind of rather nobody knew I was
here, if you don t mind."
The sisters looked at each other with
pity in their eyes, which said, as plainly
as words. "See how hard usage warps the
kindly nature of an unfortunate man."
Aunty Mehitable assured , him that he
Blight live entirely by himself and need
meet "no one. There was an old suit of
the gardener's in the outhouse; perhaps
that would do for him, and they would
pay the gardener for it when he returned
in the autumn.
"That'll be Just the ticket." replied the
man.
"And now what is your name?" she
asked.
"Abner Grice," he answered, after a
perceptible pause, for tae question cams
upon him unexpectedly and he had some
trouble in recollecting the name he had
fixed upon at tbe gate.
.Thus it was arranged, and Abner Grice
worked faithfully and well, with more
success than might have been expected ;
he proved to be an ingenious and most
rtfcourceful man. If there was any odd
job to do about the cottage, a boiler to
niend. a lock to repair, seemed a
very magician with tools. â¢
â¢'I know your trade," ' cried Aunt Eu
phemia triumphantly, once" as ' she ' stood
watching him exx>crtly soldering a pipe.
'"Ah!"' gasped .Abner with a start,
"what is it?"
"i'ou're a j>lumber."
"Yes, mum," he said with a' sigh of
relief, "you've hit it; the first time."
"Now, .why couldn't you open a plumb
ing shop in the village next winter, for
there Isn't one. although we. have water
works here, and must send to town
.twelve miles away, when there Is any
thing to be done." ''*Â£&&
"VA sooner open a bank." muttered
Abner.
"WhaCs that?" . cried. Miss Euphemia
in < astonishment.
roean I haven't, the capital, and I
suppose a bank wouldn't care to back
me up."
Vlt sarely wouldn't take much capital." â¢
said Aunt Euithemia. -
VMore than I've cot," remarked Abner.
as"he finished his task.
Spring blend<*<J' into, summer/ and sum
mer was. wearing into autumn.' but still
Abner Grice' worked ; for tbe 1 two ; ancient â¢
ladies, and ate at their hospitable board,
for they had insisted that he should have
his meals with them. . . *
I n Septemb er . he told . them he â¢ thou gh t
of -leaving , them,' but they begged â¢ him . to
remain, and he said - he; would" until the

The two sisters had been having. tea' at
the Squire 's,'.; for they were welcome
ru>sUs wfth rich and poor alike, and over
their next meal at' home they 'gossiped
about their visit.
"And such a- lovely new solid silver tea
service the. Squire" has bought." Aunty
Mehltable eald < to. Abner.;, who;, regarded
her: silently. "Ah, that is what it is to
have money! Goodness knows how^much
It must have cost! I don't care for gauds
or Jewels. - but I :-. should like \u25a0 to "! have " a
tea service like that."
â¢"And m>' should I." sighed Aunt Euphe
mJa. "Perhaps if we saved up-" .
But Aunty Mehitable sorrowfully shook
her head. â¢ < .
"We could never, never do It," she re-:
piled. - ; ;
All of which goes to show that we rare
-ly know what good' luck. awaits -us. The
charming old "ladles, were, to have their
hearts' desire -.granted when they least
expected it. and 'that 'right soon. .
E very J night' before "they went, to bed
they carefully, locked and barred their
doors and securely fastened all their win
dows. Just" as If there was -untold treas
ure in the house.-: In spite of thepe never
neglected precautions . they saw :'as soon :
as they got up. one morninsr .that their i
domicile : - had - been entered, ; â¢' although
neither of them had heard : a. sound dur-.
.ing the night." There' on the; table, to;
â¢ their amazement,. stood' the *sll\-er service.
In the sugar basin - was placed a' letter,
which Aunty Mehitable tooh with ' trem
bling hands ; and, ;; after' reading It, " : she ,
uttered an ; exclamation 7 of 'despair and'
let it flutter to" the floor. .Aunt .Euphe-i
mia picked It up' and. read it in v her!turn. f ;
"Dear ladies." -it began. V - continuing
with deplorable spelling, which* need not;
be recorded here, "you have- been good:
to me, and this' is all I can'do'in^return: '
The so.uire is* rich . and- will never n miss
the service. KeeD it dark 'for a ".while,
for they will never think* of -looking for l
it in the cottage, , anyhow. You can't
give it back. for. If you -do it will- land
me in prison; and I know "you -wouldn't
want to do that. I'm a- burglar. I am. .
and a good one, you bet. '.' I've bolted, so
you won't see no ; more of me. It,.isn't
real silver, anyhow,- but plate,' -so the
squire deserves to have It pinched. P.- S.â
I didn't take anything else, 'cause the
squire's a friend of = yours."-- â¢ ' .. â¢
,The two old â¢ ladies : ; sat down breath- -
Itss and began to weep^quietly and hope
lessly. - â¢ _ ,
"What are we '.to -do?" -said AuntEu
phemia at last, leaving decision with, the \u25a0
other, as . she always did when things
came to a crisis. â¢ - â¢â¢
"We must take the .set. back, at once;
that is ; the first thing to be done. If .we
delay â¢ some innocent man may. be ar
rested." W'WVllliJW^fWf^fflS^f^^Mt^Hj
"Poor Abner." moaned Miss Euphemta.
dolefully. "Then they will, catch him
and put him in prison, perhaps for life."
"No; that will never do. .We must save
Abner: and. after, all. he did 'it for us. If"
we give , the things -." back immediately,
perhaps they won't do anything to him..
We'll beg the squire not to say a word
about it." " -' . '
Miss Euphemia shook her head.
"I'm afraid it's too late for that. Early .
this morning, when I first awoke. I heard
the - galloping - of , a . horse,^ and I } looked ,
out to see. who it.wa?. for I 'thought' lf

Â«hy I rejoiced at the opportuniiJy .of
meeting the subject of this sketch. Krah
tls J. McCarty, Inventor of -a system 'of
vij-elesE telephony.
That he. a boy of fourteen,' should have
discovered the secret of transmitting trie
tcnes of the human voice over long dis
\ tances without the use of wires, in the
face of statements from most of. the, sci
entists who had considered the"' problem
and pronounced it impossible ofÂ»solution,
. puts him in a place apart. He is not to
V> Judged by ordinary standards, for
the scheme was evolved by acci-
or as the result of dose stud}', he
r;as put the world in the way of still, fur
ther annihilates its limitations of Jime
and space, and all the world is his debtor.
Do you wonder what manner of boy he
is. this youthful inventor?/
Three years have passed since he had
his fim sroof that the Hertzian waves
will carry the sound of the .voice as well
as inarticulate impulses, and he has
grown into a tall, slender youth of seven
teen.
Quiet of manner and direct of speech,
he Is a type of the vigorous American
boyhood with which we are all acquaint
ed and upon which we are depending for
oar great work of the future.
Xot until he -begins to talk upon the
subject of wireless telegraph and tele
phone does he appear to differ from any
one of a hundred young men -we know,
but then his voice takes on a new tone
he rpeaks as one having authority.
"People think," says this student of the
new use for electric power, "that only
recently baa there been any attention
given to the Invention of a wireless tele
phune. but that Is not true. More than
forty years -eca Morse had a plan for
comratmlcatlngL without tllrect connection,
and.- though- be used three or four times
Â«f much wire as would have been needed
for the other system, which made it im
practical for commercial purposes, he
pro\-ed that with only the . ether as ; a
tnediunj vocal tones could be transmit-

continues to talk of the early, in-^
and I learn of Lindsey, a
Scotchman, -who had definite theories of
both wire Jess telephone and telegraph sys-i
terns, a- generation ago. and who is also!
reported to liave studied the problem of;
electric light. He was pitiably poor, hove
ever, often going without food in order to
buy Eome piece of apparatus required 'ln
his experiments, and was unable to bring
his work to completion. "
The discoveries of Hertz, the great Ger
man, are discussed .with enthusiasm, and
vie -pass on to the achievements of Popoff.
who demonstrated before the Russian Re
j-rarch Society, ten years ago. a wireless
telegraphy equipment that was satisfac
tory under limited tests.
What a pleasure' lt Is to. listen to* his
clcar/vconcisfe statements!
With what a complete absence of self
conisclousness are his. opinions and facts
demurred: . '.
This is no precocious youth, who. ha,v
\u2666 ing stumbled. ujÂ»on - an , important discov
ery, preens himself . upon his distinction.
He is ah investigator by virtue of ills
tempiera mental fitness and we .may rea
sonably expect ,Irom him, other, valuable
contributions as-bis <xpcrtence. widens.
Quite naturally, too, does he assume the
teacher's \u25a0 attitude and his Illustrationsâ
homely; examples to illustrate principle
that arc elemental to nitrite If. but un

The Tragedy of the Humorist
WHAT is a humorist and why?
.The answer to this "j double
barreled conundrum is so
simple that. It is . hardly.
! 'worth offering to.an^inteili
\ gent community. In the beginning the
humorist Is. an accident; later he is a
â¢ habit. This Is the alpha arid oniega
>of the whole matter. The budding hu
Â» morlst Is launched upon his career of'
t after-dinner speeches, .contributions to
[ the comic supplements and other minor
\ misdemeanors â¢by the -.veriest chance. .

Our Georgian has the courage of her

of replies.
I am an interested reader of your page,
and the query as to whether housekeeper*
of the present day are equal to or inferior
to their Krandmothers finds a feeling reply
In my heart. I am taking time when I
chould be asleep, to write you. \u25a0
In my Judgment, there are two, nay
three, valid reasons for there being fewer
"beanttful housekeepers" <if there be few
Â«rÂ» now thin two generations ago.-
One. and 1 think the principal, is ; that
girls now art not taught by their . mothers
ihÂ« principles of oroer. system ana neat
ness of that exaulsite housekeeping' \u25a0 for"
which our rraternsl grandparents wer*
Justly famous? Then, girls grew up with
the idea of one dÂ»y having homes of their
own. and counted it disgraceful not to know
by experience every -in and>outV of house- -
hold management. Now. nearly every girj
looks forward tÂ» a "career.", as she styles
It. not knowing that the career for which
ood made her, that of housemother, is the
truest, sweetest and mou eoul-jtatlsfyins
which uhe can choose. She should be rittcJ
for this as surely as she woald bÂ« nttfl
to teach, keep books, etc. '
Secondlyâ and why many people are ask
rir \u00845 nd , AP Ibc 'Â» mÂ»Â«Â«-1i the poor
nealth of the presenr generation of women

rank he . assigns to the" apple tree
is therefore worthy of respect, and;
lias been abundantly confirmed by â¢
latter-day pomologists and . dieti- '/.

a jfive-pound basket of Concords,

THE BABY AND HIS BOTTLE
When to Give it to Him and How to Prepare His Food
. By Dr. Emelyn L. Coolidge.
iCopyright. I*os. by A. S. Barnes & Co.
T F THE mother is nursing her baby,
I and he has never had a bottle,, it
is now time to begin to give him
one each day. Borne doctors even
advise one bottle-feeding a day \u25a0 from
Jm Â£ veT T *tart of an Infant's life.
fiStsuld 1 the mother's milk then sudden
ly, fail, pr should Ehe be obliged to
leave the child for a short time, there
will be no* struggle, ,which would be
especially hard for the baby If It hap
pened to be In hot weather.
By very gradually accustoming the
digestive organs to cow'b milk, the dan
per of a bad attack of indigestion, when
the child must be weaned. Is lessened
to a great degree, and is generally
obviated entirely.
A baby who has always been breast
fed cannot take nearly so strong a
formula as one who has never had
anything but cow's 'milk from the be
ginning of his life. Hence, commence
by givingxthe baby of 4 months one
meal a day of a formula prescribed for
& bottle baby 1 month old. To calcu
late the amount necessary for one or
.two meals a day only, take one-eighth
or one-fourth of the separate ingredi
ents mentioned in the formula, then
there will* be very little waete. . .
First, give the- baby three ounces of
the formula; then. It all goes well, after
a flay or two let him have three and a
half ounceE. instead of one meal, from
Letter Party for an Invalid
ONE of the prettiest ideas, ever :
thooght- of \u25a0in connection' with
work for invalids. Is that of a let
ter party.
Any one who h?s ."ever taken' care of/
an Invalid knows bow very depressing it
is to have several visitors In a day," or',
even one. who settles herself to np*ma
the day. The invalid brightens up, tem
porarily, but there's an ; inevitable I re
aciion. trying to both invalid and nursÂ«;.
But holidays that have to be spent
quietly- in a. room while .all your world,
< except ' for some unselfish one, * who ; is^.
l-eepinj ycu cdcirany) is off cejebratingr;
Is as depressing as the reaction from
100 ranch company..
Â£o Â»cÂ»ebodj- thought of a letter party
Zorcnc fortunate invalid; and quietly,
canvassed the lons list of her friends.
OntHe day sst-it was the coming-out,
day- of* her 'best fziesd; and sh-Â» was
â¢dwacrately blue over, helng chut out

['c Merest trtfles of thinrs (j but enough
to carry the filing of the day. \u25a0 .
T?fe letters weren't a bit alike. The
cirr who' hadlplanned- the 'party-had _
nrfr(pd everybody; and. in consequence,
hlrf was a refreshing - diversity . of,

the breast; If all goes well, at the. end
of a week give him -three ounces of a
formula suitable, for a baby : 2 months
old; then wait a few days and give him
four ounces of this formula. Now wait
a week and give him the same amount
of a formula- suited for a 3-month
old child.. Keep him on this. for. a week,- '
then increase the quantity to four
ounces and a half. Then, if there are
no signs of indigestion after, another
week has passed, give liim four ounces
of a formula used for the fourth month,
and if he cries for the bottle after emp
tying it eagerly, wait a day or two and
Increase the amount to four and a half
ounces, and then to five ounces. As he
grows older, now give him the formula :
and amount usually. taken by bottle-fed -
infants of a corresponding age. "
Should the baby vomit, have curds in
his movements, or have colic, keep him.
on a weak formula for a longer period
than advised above. .
A baby, who has always been bottle
fed, and who is digesting his food well,
should now be able to take a formula
composed of the ; following: < Six ounces
of top. milk skimmed from the top of a
quart bottle of milk, six ounces of milk"
poured off, twenty-four ounces of barley
or oatmeal grue), six teaspoonfuis of
milk sugar or three of granulated sugar,
a pinch' of salt, and a pinch of blear-,
bonate of soda. He 'should have, four,
or five ounces of this 'every three hours
up to 9 or io P. M., then one mealonly
betweenthat time and 6 or 7 A.* M.Â» .
sisted in calling himselfâ the letter the
invalid most enjoyed Jwas one from the
debutante, for it lncloeed a scrap of- her
gown and went IntÂ«V elaborate 'details
about its, making and about everything
todo.with the party, the color-scheme
and the supper.
KEEPING UP SUPPLIES
THE convenience and time-saving of
having little. things at. hand can,:
scarcely be overestimated. < It
works exactly on the 'same prin
ciple -.as'tho. oJd saying of "a stitch in
time.' ; '. ' - . - â¢- -
It's -not -enough, to .have- a -place .for ;
rverything. and everythingâ unless you
happen to be out of Itâ in its" place - It's
the careful planning so that .; plentiful
supplies rof ' all -the i little things are al- ,
ways on hand that counts to greatly \u25a0 â¢
So often you haven't the right buttons;"
. or, you run short of tape,; or hooks and 1 ,
eyes,, or 1 the,*, color; of * sewing silk . you
need, and you have to postpone the mo
ment you'd' seized for, getting; all such -
things out of the ; way. : In :- the . mean-".

Coil's Weekly Cartoon
on American Society .
There are lecturers who give "Illus
trated lecutres" with ;the aid of lantern
slides â stereoscopic views. l.
Lecturers are employed : to encourage
debating, societies and college meetings,
to help the timid to speak out. Many a.
young girl has been led Into lecturing by _.
explaining pictures she has taken. whila
traveling. , . . . . .-, '. . .
In the lecture courses given by thÂ«
. Boards of Education in large cities one
woman will be found for every man.
Unless you are fond of the subject and
talk from the heart, the public will soon,
find out that you are after the money:
only, r and you will be a failure "as a â¢
public speaker.' â¢
- Some lecturers make their 'date*.'
through .a well-.kno.wn bureau: others
attend Lto this part of their business^
themselves, thus saving the percentage.'
Earnings. <-\u25a0
-The earnings are on an average from
$10 to *125 a "night. WhenJIOO can be.
asked for a lecture; the speaker must Â»
be well known and have " a good repu
tation. The Boards of Education pay
$10 a -night for their courses. '*' jt~
Some lyceum : stars have received as
much as $2000 for one night, but not of'
late years. ..The profession lsi too over
crowded.. When Susan B. Anthony .was .
In "the â¢ height of her success, she .could â¢
not begin to fill the lecture "engagement*
open to ~ her." '
Parlor. lectures. call forewomen speak
ers on the f Bible ' and popular authors;
â¢ sometimes the lecturers read from their
own.books,. books, and assume in a way the
.'attitude Vof teacher. In a certain ' time
âof , the year, courses of ten ' lectures '.ara';
arranged^for^with a limited number of
tickets issued, .the .usual price for thY :
course being' $5 and $10. '- . â¢ /-; '\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0'-\

AUTHOR AROUSES
IRE OF TYRANT
Sienkiewicz Speaks for tHe Rolish
People and Is Imprisoned ; \u25a0
at His Home.
â¢VVARSATV. Poland, Sept. 23. â Henry
Â£:enkiewlcz, the most famous of Polish
novelists, who makes his home In this
turbulent city, has recently been ex
1-eriendng the displeasure of the Rus
sian authorities. The distinguished
author of "Quo Vadis," who Is an ar
dcnt-yatriot. recently joined several of
his fellow citizens of Warsaw in draw
ins up and publishing a vigorous pro
test against the Russlfication of Polish
schools, and for so doing was arrested
â¢-nd sentenced to a fortnight's deten
tion In the unpretentious flat which he
occupies in the Hozan street. No. '22.
This period has now expired, but Mr.
Sienkiewicz evidently thinks it wise to
court retirement for a whlle^ longer
and hopes of a talk with him, were
frustrated by the receipt of a card on
v.-hich was written, in the author's mi
rroscoplc, copper-plate hand, the in
formation that he would be quite un
willing to say anything for publication.
It Is possible, however, to give some
facts concerning him, moÃtly new, and
which are at any rate authentic.
In spite of his great literary talents
and the undoubted success of his books,
the distinguished author of "Quo Vadis"
is not believed to be rich. His works
have brought him more famo than
money. "While they have been trans
lated Into many tongues and published
in many lands, they have never yielded
him anything like what might reason- j
.ably have been expected. Russia's lack
of copyright laws makes it difficult for
her literary men to protect their work '
abroad.
At the present time Sienkiewicz has
arranged to have his books appear first !
in English, a course which has greatly !
offended the patriotic sentiments of the i
Poles, but it Is only fair and reasonable, ;
after all. that ihe should do anything
possible to get the. best remuneration
for his toiL
Sienkiewicz's domestic life has not '
been uneventful; In fact, *his matrimo
ciÂ«.l affairs have afforded much material
for gossip. He married first Ma.rja
Szotklewlcz, with whom he lived hap
pily for several years. They had two
children, a boy and a girl. The former
Is now a student In the Polish Univer
sity at Cracow. The girl is remarkably
pretty, of a rather English type, with
a lovely complexion and beautiful fair
hair. She is of a charming disposition,
and very popular among the younger
members of the intellectual society in
Warsaw. ' - \u25a0
Sienkiewicz remained a widower for
some years. His second matrimonial
venture was of a very different char
acter. The lady was the young and
beautiful daughter of a Polish landed
proprietor named Wolodkiewicz. - She
had read Sienkiewicz's books, and con-;
ceived a violent passion for the writer!
Persuading her father to bring hereto
Warsaw, she Boon contrived to meet
Sienkiewicz and fell in love with him
immediately. Her affection was . re
quited, and after a very brief courtship
they were married and started on a
foreign tour for their honeymoon. At
Vienna, however, the first stage of the
journey, some extraordinary disagree
ment "seems to have taken place. The
youthful bride telegraphed for > her
mother, and left her middle-aged hus
band in the Austrian capital. Husband
and wife never met again, and later
a divorce was obtained. The lady has
married again, not a distinguished au
thor, but a plain country squire and
thoroughly good sportsman named !

had work in the conferring of the degree
of the order, and the members were so
pleased with it that they declare they
â¢want to see it again, and in order to do
so will have candidates for Initiation. .
Reports from the various courts in this
city are to the effect that they are work
ing with a will to increase the organiza
tion.
During the cession of the High Court

At the meeting of the San Francisco
board of deputies last week, William
Stewart in the chair, the affairs of the
present board, which will go out of ex
istence with the meeting of the High

present board be followed, as the result
ef the work of that body has been very
satisfactory.

At the recent session of the Supreme,

INTERMINABLE CLASHING OF ART AND TRADE
Art and Commercialism Â»re at It again.
It's the old, old tale of the painter: and
the dealerâ another characterization - of
the alliance of the Beauty and the Beast*
The plain tale,, shorn of verbiage, is a
story that can be told by every artist; in
San Franciscoâ or elsewhere, for - that
matterâ at' some time of his 'career. And
the story runs thusly:
A picture Is sent-, to. a "dealer with, the
price placed upon It by the' painter. .' This
forms the basis from which the
works. According- to trade "ethics, he ' is
entitled to 25/ per cent of . the purchase
price. Besides, he, is usually called upon
to furnish the frame, and names his own
price therefor. "; Now, this arrangement < is
known as legitimateâ lest ; Indeed the
frame is so '"artistic" \u25a0as \u25a0 to consume/ the
other 75 per cent of the purchase price.
For these things, the artist is prepared,
for he knows, if; he be a^ fellow -.who likes"
fair ' play, that the dealer will give hia
pictures the necessary ; publicity, . and uri
fler the best circumstances; that in doing.
60, he incurs expensesv such \u25a0as -. printing,
help,; rent, equipment, ; light, ' etc./, and . for
these he. mun* be- reimbursed, for*" the
i( aler is not- in art' for [ art's > sake. *
No**, this is] riot to say- that the dealer
has no appreciation 'of. art.'!; He hasâ if
he be a successful \u25a0 dealer/ ' It \is as much
a part of his commercial equipment zs,~ is
.bis cash; - But" the. fact remainsâ and fno
obloquy attaches tberctOy-that^ the dealer
*Â» in art for what 7 there' is; ln : it. True;
,54^ may lay claim to being a public": educa-'
toX He !s,*but that Is not; what 'he went
Into business for. He , < may ' claimT-and

a good deal more, beginning with a
.witty. scoring of. those who have blamed
the" dramatistâfurther than for his un
fortunate choice â¢' of subject â for thÂ»
failure of the play, Vv ''
â¢ Vlt. is "absurd ito blame the play
wright here."- the'actor said.* "The ma
terial of ; the book ; is simply not ; trans
latable' into the , dramatic ! termâ the
conflict between brute force and moral
courage.. What are - your chief,char
acters?. Your, only hero? You- cannot
put a coward up ' for : a" hero.'* and that
isthe only "fashion s in r which it ls'pos-~
' slble^for-Van â¢ Weyden .to be dramati

1 - "It is all very well to \u25a0 give* him moral
courage.' but If a man hits me In the face
; and' I ;don't l hit back" (as Van Weyden
does not) I am going to look the coward."
' whatever 'my motive in; refraining. Given
i a scene, say. in which a" yellow fever ship
i touches * the > 'Ghost." "and Larsen slinks
: to' his cabin.'" while Van Weyden slaps his

' ' "Then : the story begins .with fight, goes

"Away Down South In Dixie" will
soon be heard as the song of the city
dwellers. It will be whistled in the
streets, and played in the cafes, and
sung in the clubs, for know ye all
that during the first week in October
hundreds of Southern women from all
over the Union will be guests in our
City-by-the-Turquoise-Sea.
What is it all about?
The annual foregathering of t the
Daughters of the Confederacy, one of
the most admirable organizations .of
women, since it combines in pretty
fashion the social with the philanthropic
As to the lighter side, all the world
knows that the Southern woman is the
symbol of cordiality and social . life.
She was reared in an atmosphere of
geniality, and it molded her into a so
cial creature, with infinite graces of
mind and body. And these she brings
into the Daughters of the Confeder
acy with all the interesting traditions
of the picturesque days gone by â but
mark you. with none of its bitterness,
none of its rankle. All of that was
buried deep in the late war, such of It
as may have survived the passing years.
As to the philanthropic side of the
organization, the women of San Fran
cisco, where abide the Albert Sidney
Johnston and the Jefferson Davis chap
ters, have assumed many \ things, no
tably the looking after of N aged Con
federate soldiers, providing them with
employment, finding them homes, car
ing for them when ill, laying them to
rest when the summons comes. Be
sides, they gladden the old chaps'
hearts by bestowing bronze medals
upon them and otherwise honoring
them for their loyalty to the cause they
believed to be right. The latter du
ties have been prettily discharged by
the Albert Sidney Johnston. Chapter,
founded and still presided over by Mrs.
Alfred Hunter Voorhies. And another
tender tribute the chapter pays to the
men that wore the gray is the annual
observance of Memorial day â Memo
rial day for the* , Southernerâ when
blossoms are strewn over their rest
ing-places, even as over the men who
wore tbe blue.
Already tralnloads of Southern women
with their husbands, sons and daughters
are setting their faces toward the West^
and by the first of the month' they will
arrive in mobs. The Palace will be the
official headquarters, and here there will
be a swirl of sessions, teas, dinners, re
ceptions and the rest of the things that
happen at conventions; although â¢ Mrs.
Voorhies very wisely has planned that
her visitorsâ and they are hers in that It
was her enthusiastic speech at St. Louis
that brought the convention to San Fran
ciscoâshall see all of our beautiful coun
try that is possible. And teas and re
ceptions are inane and stupid, anyway,
where so large a number of people are
strangers.
Mrs. Voorhifs is planning to entertain
a large house-party, with Mrs. -Malcolm
Henry and Mrs. Thomas Porter Bishop
assisting her. So. too, will Mrs. Pritch
ard and Mrs. Selden Wright, who, with
Mrs. Voorhies, organized the original
chapter in California. Mrs. Montgomery.
thÂ«r State president, will come up from
Los Anp< les with a big delegation from
the southland.
The Palace will have never been so gay
as during that eventful week, one night
of which will be given over to the annual !
Charity Ball, the proceeds of which pro
vide hospital service for the poor old
chaps who fought with Lee.
The vessel that brings the Taf t party
back to America is looked for ; on the
morning of the 6th. .If she keeps her
promise, then the Taf t party will be
guests at the big ballâ the first big ball
â¢of the winttr.
And of courae, you're going? - -
And by the way, if you can't whistle
"Dixi*." you'd 1 better learn.
Everybody will be whistling It in a.
week, and If you can't you'll feel foolish.'

The wedding of pretty Alice May and
William A. Sexton on Thursday morning
at St. Ignatius Church stands out as one
of ths distinctive weddings of tbeyear.'
To begin with, the day was superb--a
joyous Indian summer day. lending itself
to pretty pageantry of the nuptials.
Then the bride was fair to look upon:
indeed was she more than fair, for she
wBf rapturously happy, a rather new
thing In brides.
And the groom was equally happy, and
almost as good to look upon.
But these were not the striking' features
of. the service. Nor.were the flowers nor
ihe flickering candles in their, , brass
sconces, nor yet the gorgeous. raiment of
the priests at the altar rail the arresting
featuresâ it was the dignity of the ser
vice, followed by a : nuptial mass.
Seldom has the majesty of the marriage
service been so exemplified, for every, de
tailâall save the musicâ were of the sim
plest character.
And as for the music, "Lohengrin" and
Mendelssohn have been seldom , heard in
the Wert.as they, were given on the great
organ by, Dr. O'ConnelL, \u25a0â¢ worthy successor
to- Clarence Eddy, who christened the
splendid instrument;
The organ recital during the mass will
live In the memories of every guestâpar
ticularly the glory ; and gladness of Men
delssohn.

DIRECT SERVICE TO ALASKA;
RECENT correspondence from the business r men;; of Nome-re
veals the need of direct transportation scrvce, between San*
Francisco and the rapidly developing seaports of Alaska. The
enterprise of this city has been so busy with the developed trade that
lies within reach of its tfeet that but little attention, has been, giveif
to the developing trade which is capable of expansion by the en
couragement of proper transportation facilities: Railroads use
credit in building into undeveloped territory, trusting to settlement
and the future for paying tonnage. It costs less 4 to run ships than
to operate railroads, and the same experience usually follows the
installation of sea transportation facilities. ; /
Alaska is no longer a negligible factor in the world's; commerce.
Formerly considered to be only hunting ground for fur takers, and
iate% a resort for fishermen, the Territory is now in full blast; as n
producer of gold, coal and copper. It is the history of all parts'
of the world where mining is profitable that other industries follow,
and other resources and capacities are discovered.
We are now enlightened as to the climate and physical condi
tions of Alaska to such an extent as to warrant a systematic assault
upon all of its resources, known and unknown, with reasonable as
surance that their development will follow the known lines mad-;
plain by the experience of the fur, fishing and mining industries.
Much of the trade generated by these v has gone to I^uget Sound
ports, to the exclusion of San Francisco! But the Alaskans now.
want larger facilities which will enable San Francisco to compete
with the more northern ports. *
Alaska has an area of 599,446 square miles, and, excepting the
Louisiana purchase, is the largest addition made to our originalarea.
It is rich in minerals and forests. Our people have fallen into error
about the climate of the Territory. This error has been somewhat
corrected by "Three Years in Alaska," written by Senator Lynch of
this city, which" has been reprinted in several languages and is ac
cepted authority. The climate is no bar to development. This is
shown by the increase in population. In 1890 the population was
returned at 32,052. In 1900 it had increased to 63,441. A. Territory
that can support a duplication of its population in ten years cannot
be overlooked commercially by a neighboring seaport likel San Fran
cisco. There is a mean annual rainfall of 83 inches, but tHat is not
appalling. At Shasta, California, the mean rainfall is 99 inches.
Mobile has 65 and Pensacola 70, while the State of Washington
flourishes with 123 inches at Neah Bay. It is sufficient to say "that
the phjsical features of Alaska have not deterred men from settling
and living at any place in the Territory where the natural resources
may be profitably developed. .
Every year since our ownership of the Territory has had its
startling discovery of something deserving the attention of .the
world. The time has now come when the Government owes to com
merce the most efficient charting of the harbors and waters 61
Alaska, and when San Francisco needs something better in the: way
ci direct transportation than is furnished by one small steamer.
The Packers' Association and the Alaska Commercial Company have
their own ships, used in their own trade, communicating with their
posts in the north. General commerce requires regular transporta
tion, reaching ports in the North Pacific and* entering' Bering Sea
by the Aleutian passes. We are reaching out by transportation; fa
cilities for trade in ail other directions, by , land and sea, and why
not in* this? â¢ 'â¢....-. ...â¢:- ."..,3.3
We will very soon 1 have a third overland road T to San Franascor
It comes in responseto expectation- of increase in 1 ourj commerce by,
sea. To supply the needs* of the rapidly^growing^nterestsVofvAlaska 1
will require a volume of trade sufficient to temp't-the ambition and
the enterprise of our merchants and shippers. We let; it go by
default to the northern ports. Our inattention was their good luck.
Now when a cry comes from the north for direct' trade with San
Francisco it should be heard and heeded. -
The next census will show a population in Alaska great as that
of some of the^Territories which are demanding admission into the
Union. The trade in minerals, fish, furs and timber will be immense
ly expanded. It is time to; get in* and secure the share of it; that
belongs to this city.
BAD REPORT OF PORTO RICO.
RICH opportunities are going to wholesale waste in our newly
acquired island, Porto Rico, according to a student of condi
tions there who writes for the September number of the
North American Review. The rich soil is growing jungle and the
people are discontented andrnany-of them starving. They expected
a great betterment of their lot when they willingly placed them
selves under the control" of the American flag, but,* bitterly disap
pointed, they find themselves by far worse off than they were under
Spanish rule. The writer gives a very definite reason for. this, which,
if correct, shows that the misfortunes there are as easily remedied
as the repeal of a. carelessly made law. This law, aimed at the re
straint bf corporations, shuts out capital from profitably developing
the island's rich resources, and is thus at once bringing "oppressive
poverty to the Porto Ricans and barring American enterprise 'from
remunerative f expansion. â¢
The criticized law seems'to have been enacted by. a sort of an
accident, and is continued in force by an evil inertia. When the
form of government was changed from -military to civil (in 190o v some
of the_ necessary- civil appointments had not- been made, and tKe're-!
fore - some of . the officers ; of the , military.' government had to con
tinue their duties. By this,- under the standing law, they became"lia
ble to lose their army commissions, and to relieve" them an ': act
was hastily passed. The Committee on Insular Affairs tacked oritto
this emergency compelled law a ccompetel etc code of restrictions upon'
corporate investment, such, it is said, as never could ha"velbeen im
posed" in any State or Territory in the Union . President Â» McKinley \
was so desirous of preventing the officers] from .losing their commis
sions that he urged the instant passage^of- the resolution, saying that
it could be corrected, if necessary,v later on; The committee 'is- be
lieved to have been frightened into tacking on, the restrictions be
cause numerous companies with immense capital were supposed to
have been set afloat .for the purpose ; of exploiting the; island to an
extent that would have been like selfish ravage.
This well meant paternalism is claimed to have worked in: a 1a 1
way directly opposite of the benevolent intention soYfar as theipros
perity of the islanders is concerned. The country "needs railroads
and the rich agricultural lands can be handled "profitably, only in
large bodies* and by " abundant capital and expert management. It
is believed that 550.000.000 would be invested there if ftherestfictions
were removed. Santiago- Iglesias, who was the' representative of
Porto Rico at the time the American Federation Vof , Labor met in
this city last November, said, that 600 Porto Ricans die each month
from starvation, If our gooS .intentions to the - islanders \in i the ? en
actment of these restrictions^ are showing. such poor results it is
surely worth while to : at least- expermient-wjththe^ policy of 'giving
capital a freer hand there to develop those advantages of "soil arid*
climate which are said to be among the richest in the .world..

A NEW BOOK. WHICH IS NOMINALLY A NOVEL, BUT IS . SAID TO BE AL
MOST HALF AUTOBIOGRAPHY. '
"THE TRIDENT AND THE NET"â
w are to consider them allegorically
now, not as a reminiscence of the cruel
grandeur and gladiator days of old
Rome, save only in the symbol sense
in which Everyman must fight life's
battles with such short sword and
small shield as metaphorically the
gods, grant, to 'save himself from the;
always-threatening net of circumstance
v Â£.nd temptation, and the fatal thrusts of
Mffr*. trtdent,which will follow fast if ever
â¢fte lets the enmeshing tangle make im
potent his thrust arm. or useless the
guard of his god-given shield.
This old arena term, describing one of
the - methods of combat between gladi
ators. Is borrowed for the title of a new
book written by the woman who made
herself famous to' literature by giving
to the world that remarkable, love
prompted biography,. "The Martyrdom of
6.n Empress." It is her, Urst novel. Al
though nominally .a .aovel. and perhaps
as to the bulk of its narration really so,
it would be a -most. obvious guess to say
that the new book is \u25a0 almost half
biography, and is very close of kin to the
authcr's own history of her girlhood. She

Â»lie of the author's own autobiography,.
called "The Tribulations of a Princess,"
that we feel confident as we eagerly read
the new pages we are learning still more
Intimately of the life of that fascinating,
high-strung, gamely I courageous . little
person; and the word about her that we
keep feelingly \u25a0\u25a0 thinking ' all ? the - way
through Is Tboroug-hbredâ every fiber of
her, Â«very sentence of her self -revelation,
seenungly aquiver with that quality. Th,Â»
intense love of her brave, . . handsome
little brother which makes her so brave
for him. her thorough admiration of her
heroic-minded father, her proud, scorn- i
J ful compassion-tempered hate of her :
beautiful, meanly jealous mother, who
/v.ts such a superlative pervert of- pa
â¢^rncianiEmâ all these are in the novel just \
is if amplifications of like revelations in
the biography. If there be . a sense in
which the word princess has a meaning
tbore the chance and change of the ad
ventitious one of Europeanly granted
title, then so will this writer be princess
to appreciative American readers, of her
beautifully emotive books.
The author has successfully preserved
her anonymity so far as the great read
ing public Is concerned, though her Iden
tity must be well known to many people
prominent in Europe. No doubt the loyal
ty of her friends is Â«uch that, sure of obe
c> nee, the can princessly command the
secret be -kept till It ts given out by, her
express permission. Surely, mettlesome
*fc she Is. tsbe must have some enemies;
but these have not oetrayed her to wide
publication, and perhaps know they, would ',
get no thanks for such communication
until the revelation is authorized of the
name of this exceedingly 'frank autobio
grapher. She has In "The Tribulations of
a PrinceEs" allowed the publication of
wveral pictures of her in her girlhood
days. One of these was made at the time
, she got the sobriquet of the ."Princess
Muzzl/' as a* pet name from her. friends;
and so she may be called for the present.
A rery peculiar life she had of it in
hrr early years, and shehas at least half
intimated that she will tell us more later
on. One of the odd things of her experi
ence which may have influenced the early
I wshfonihs : of her character is that she
A'as brought up to believe herself a boy,
snd dressed as a boy until almost 10 year*
old. This was her father's whim.\ He de
tired a boy baby so much that when she
came a girl he could not make up his
tnlnd to bear' the disappointment,, and so
raised hrr as his beloved companion, and.
naming her Pierrot, made her as much "a
boy as he possibly could.
After her. father's death her mother
with cruel severity told her that 6be was
a girl and must 'put on dresses and cul-"
Uvatfe the demure demeanor, of a maiden.'
This was one of; the first bitters of -the
tribulations of a princess. All her childish
day dreams and intentions had been of
h< role, deeds and manly adventures. - Her
admiring love of her father made her
wish to be a man like him; her hate of
her mfan mother made her, dislike things
feminine. Her distress was maddening
when she was with studied provocative
ness Informed of the truth of her sex by.
the mother,* who had always been jealous
of the father's love of ; his _ comrade, . thfi
little Pierrot. It was so hard for her to
'accept the truth that she thought; her
mother was going. Insane; when she told
Pierrot It* boyhood had suddenly, passed
into girlhood. When,.theyi put maidenly,
costume. on her she tore the flimsy things
off and stamped on them , ferociously.
How that must have galled her. To have
her Imagined adolescent . masculinity de
based by. being, dÂ«ked out, in the bar
baric trivialities of feminine attire; ;gew :
paws, trinkets, ribbons and things', un
mentlonably unmanlyâ think : of ? that ? for
the tribulations of a princess who , had
been trained to think herself a < prince,
and that her, birthright" was to become
Â»otiÂ« of the manliest of manlymen'and do
v^ 1 * deÂ«ds that only strong, .men can.NÂ»\>;
" Ttiowever,' she^ had Â«.-. tribulations worse
than that., One was to be ; married when
little more, than a chlld^of 14 years A tola
debauch c , old r enough ': to . be her i father;
Her husband, she - says, '. practiced 'â¢ vices
that she would not defile herself hinting
at. Then there was the bitter experience
of her mother's hateful jealousy and
selfish intrigue. The ever-regretted death
of her father while she was so young as
to Imperatively need his care from that
mother who loved her not was bitter.
Such is a brief outline of the author of
"The Trident and the Net," who speaks
of painful life truths out of an experience
which fully . comprehends the scriptural
saying that "the heart knoweth his own
bitterness."
The novel is something of a triumph of
artistic literary planning. As to the exe
cution of that thoughtful design, it, varies
in different " parts. But the whole as out
lined is excellent, and the ' places where
she fills out that outline with less perfect
work than she is elsewhere master ot
means nothing more than that . she had
to go out of her natural element to de
scribe some of the situations 'necessary to
round out the well-conceived . wholeness
of this* tale of the trident and, the net."
The place where her work is finest is In
the first' of the three books into which the
work is divided. It is called "As It Was
In the Beginning," and describes^ the en
vironment of the victim of the net and
trident while he was yet' a most promis
ing child and boy. Here she" ts perfectly
at home. Tln Brittany." where- her own
childhood was, is the scene, and she
pictures aristocratic "life there' and -all" {he
surroundings of nature, 'in -"storm"' and
calm; and all the beauties' of gardens
and attractions of patrician homes come
naturally to her peri; as" one to the
manor born. She is a fine horsewoman,
and the way ' she describes ( the -thor
oughbreds shows how she must' delight
in them. Here's just for a moment on
the back of one" of themâ fancy how
you'd like to' ride him:
." The quivering nostrils,' velvet-skinned.
Drink the strange prompting* of the wind,
Till wIHj the sweep of. wild sea wings
Bach ft eel web muscle plays and swings;
Till stubborn, fierce and swift doth he .
Move like a wave upon the sea.
Then. 1 If he bern the bridle-rein. â¢ â¢ .#â¢-
Here in Brittany, too, "she describes the
child, Loic. the victim, allegorically
speaking, of 'the trident and -the. net.
There can be- little doubt that she Is here
describing some child who was near, and
flear to her in her 'own chilhood^days,
and that she is using her loving realiza
tion of him to help her imagine this well
born but ill-fated youth ,of her Â» artistic
fiction. Here is a glimpse of him:-
. He was so bright, so bold, so mirthful, .so
well disposed to all the- world â when his iron
little â¢ will was not croesed â that everybody
gave in to him instinctively at the first hint
of i; frown, as tf to quench even for an | In
stant so much grace and Joie <!e vlvre ' was
to fly In the facÂ» of all the designs. of Provi
dence. - Indeed. . It would - have required a sin
gular delicacy of \u25a0. touch . and ?. wisdom and . pa
tience * of ; a very unusual . and * lofty order to
deal with such a nature, and unfortunately for
him, Lolc's father, the very man for such a
task, had died' when his little son was barely
a, "year old.
,If his father was ; the very ; man who
could have brought i to : fine manhood this
bright and: beautiful boy,* his mother was
the ; very, one , who could not; and much of
the - force and ": talent : of the story ; goes
to showing how the character of /this
woman of high birth and her. capricious
and selfish conduct \ prevented ; the â¢ high
strung boy, from developing that strength
of -.will and wisdom" '.which ; might ' have
made him victor over the enemy .with
the trident and the net. '?.
This strange mother, was, however, very
proud of her son, and loved -him,; too, Mn
her selfish. Intriguing, worldly 'way. She
glanced at Loic. Va. ,'. fine : admixture of
pride, with something -like i challenge ,: in
her smile. : Indeed, the"; boy looked v mag
nificently vivid and' gave one a*;sense7of

and of possibilities in no. way akin to" un-:

Washington Crop Bulletin.
The report of G. N. Salisbury, rectlon di
rector. United States Weather Bureau, for the
Washington Crop Bulletin, week ended Sep
tember 19, Is as follows:
The fore part of the â¢ week . was moderately
warm and the latter part somewhat cool. The
temperature- for the week was considerably
below the normal. There were lljrht rains on
<he 12th and 13th and the 16th and 17th.
which In the northwest counties were heavy
enough to Interrupt threshing and Injure I oats
In the shock. The rains were too late to be
of much benefit to crop*.: but pastures were
freshened, late root crops improved and the
coll somewhat softened, thus putting It in
better condition to prepare for fajl ' sowing.
Late potatoes were somewhat helped by the
rain, but In the drier districts the potato crop
has been lessened by the general drought. This
includes all of the eastern counties except the
Irrigated district?. In the western district
the potato crop Is very good In general, al
though there are some reports of blight. ; The
conditions In the , 6outhwest counties 'have
greatly improved over what they were last
ire ek. Fruit Jn the tinlrrlpated localities of
the eastern districts tras - also Injured . by the
firyness and heat. - . j,
Grain cutting is now finished and threshing
is nearly completed. There Is some wheat in
the shock in Whitman County that Is vet too
wet to thresh. In that county, the wheat yield
is fair. â¢ but below expectations. - Barley . la
about two-thirds of a crop: wheat three-fourths
of a crop: fruit a/allure: vegetables about half
a crop. Pastures' in Spokane County are bedly
dried up. Very little plowing, has ret 'been
done and no fall â¢w-luat sowing. Corn ts partly
in the shock in Klikttat County. The fourth
crop of alfalfa le being cut. The potato crop
Is about one-half dug and Is an average yield.
In the oats district of thÂ»> western counties
threshing Is nearly done. The crop Is b*low
average, but of good quality, except In some
pieces a fellpht amount has been discolored by
being wet. Plume and pears are a heary crop
and prunes are turning out better than antici
pated. In come localities they are very plenti
ful. Tomatoes have yielded heavily. The
weather has been somewhat unfavorable for
bop-kicking, which Is In full projrres* In all
<H*tri<rtK. : P.eporte are conflicting, but the ma
jority report a light crop. Vermin have done
considerable Injury. A good yield Is reported
in Pierce and Snohon-.leh counties.

EMPEROR IS OUSTED
FROM HUNTING SEAT
Hungarian Municipality Is
Deaf to All Appeals of
the Aged Francis Joseph
\i BUDAPEST. Sept! 23.â The Emperor
Francis Joseph has been evicted from
a*hunting estate in Hungary.
\u25a0> The Emperor had for some years past
leased -from, the municipality; of Buda
pest an estate at Godollo, where. he has
been in thÂ© habit of spending" a month
or,- two every autumn. " ' / ;:
.The please being on the point of ex
piration, the municipality, in reply to
the Emperor's. request for Its renewal,
dispatched - a message .to the ; Imperial
Court; curtly stating that it had decided
to put up the estate for public auction.
His-Majesty. through .the medium of
a representative, then made an offer for
the renewal of the lease.. but waa out
bidden several f times by other 'Intend
ing â¢; tenants, until , the price had ; risen
to enormous proportions.
On behalf.of the Emperor, the deputy.
M. Hedervary, . then proposed a compro
mise,': and 'asked that the municipality
should ' bind Itself not to permit any
hunting in the locality during the Em\
peror's so journ -at â¢ the villa of GodoHo/'
which is his Majesty's private property.
: -This request was flatly 'refused, \u25a0'- the
municipality formally declaring' that "it
could not* compel the : population to
show; that : much consideration ' toward
the sovereign." â¢
The syndicate formed for the acauisi-"
tion ; of 'the estate thereupon deposited
$20,000 ;.wlth the .municipality; toward

FRANCIS JOSEPH MAKES
A SMALL CONCESSION
Hungarian Situa
tion Unchanged
by Meeting.
Leaders Irritated
by Result of
Conference.
VIE3CXA. Sept. 21â The result of the au
dience of the King-Emperor to-day by the
leaders of the Hungarian coalition parties
is anxiously awaited. The interview seems
not to have brought the crisis any nearer
& solution, and even the King-Emperor's
concession to the objection of the leader
to entering into negotiations with Count
Ooluchowski. the Minister of the imperial
and royal house, relative to the formation
of a Hungarian Cabinet and his substitu
tion of Count Cziraky for the Minister la
cot thought likely to make any difference
in the situation.
Francis Kossuth, leader of the coalition
element, who was in a pessimistic mood,
declared in an interview that it was quite
impossible that the Parliamentary major
ity should take its programme from the
crown. The majority, he said. J was
pledged to a certain platform, and to this
It must hold, and if it did not do so it
could not hold cut for twenty-four hours.
i_- Count, Apponyi said:
J^Â« "The will of the nation will always pre
' valL The present struggle may continue
clx months, but the nation certainly, will
be victorious in the end."
The King-Emperor. Francis Joseph, re
ceived the five leaders of the Hungarian
coalition parties, namely. Count Julius
\u25a0An&rassy. Francis Kossuth, Baron
Banffy, Count Zichy \u25a0 and Count Albert
Apponfi, at the palace. He suggested
that they Â«nter into, negotiations with
Count Goluchowski, the Minister of the
imperial and royal house, relative to the
formation of a Hungarian Cabinet. . The
King-Emperor showed himself ready 'to
xnÂ£ke what he regards as an appreciable
concession In the direction desired .by ' the
Hungarian nation.
The King-Emperor remained unyielding
on the question of the language. of com
mand in the Hungarian army.. He invited
â¢ the coalition majority to submit proposals
for the formation of a Cabinet on the fol
lowing conditions:
. 'â¢Military questions relating' to the lan
"guage of command and the service â¢ on
. -which questions are entirely inadmissible
are to be excluded from: the .proposals
which are to' be submitted to the army.
"The foreign missions must also remain
Intact. As to questions affecting the eco
nomic and other relations of Austria-
Hungary as provided by the law of 1557,
these shall be revised by negotiations be
tween the governments of the two states
and Parliamentary committee. . >_
"The budget, ordinary contingents â¢to
the army, commercial treaties and the
two years' military service bills must be
rvoted, as well as the sums required for
% military purposes and for the Hungarian
' expenditure of the dual monarch for
ISO 4-05." - ... -.*,'
The King-Emperor in the course of the
audience seriously represented to the
Hungarian leaders the responsibility they
would Incur in refusing to accept the con
cessions offered and 'in maintaining their
old demands.
The audience only lasted a few minutes
and the Hungarian leaders were not given
a. chance to submit their views or discuss
the matters at issue. They expressed
great disappointment at their treatment
and apparently were highly irritated at
the result of the audience.

Franklin Leonard Jr., a defeated Demo

Seventeenth District of, this city, to-day
asked McCall how much of his money
paid on a life Insurance policy had been
used to defeat him. Leonard's letter was
prompted by President McCall's state
ment before the legislative Investigating
committee that he had ordered a con
tribution of about $48,000 to the Repub
lican national campaign fund in 1904. The
letter follows: <
"Mr.. John A. McCall. President New

in French naval circles, according to the

the fear^hat the plans of the best French
submarine '. boat have been obtained by
German .' naval constructors. Dispatches
; published recently In several papers stated
! that a submersible boat had been launched
at Kiel and" that thevesselhad been con-;
structed ' on" plans by' a' French designer.
It , , asserted *â¢ tISV-^khese plans i were
treasonably^, sold tOiGermany. -, r

whosA^olans - the latest type of ' French '

the boat \u25a0 launched at J Klel.ls a copy of
the i Aisrette. '.'-. . ; , Â»- â¢'
The description of/ the ' Kiel boat which
M: Laubeuf obtained tallies exactly with
the measurements " of the "Alerette.
"*-' "Tliat'there should be" merely a coinci
dence," says 'JL Laubeuf, -.t'is .impossible.
The. exact similarity, of the figures ; implies
similarity of type In which dimensions are
the essential characteristics, and I cannot
suppose ' that , an ', engineer 'in Germany
i should have .realized " the. type of the
Aigrette,- without having my plans to
work on." i
'â¢ JI. - La ubeuf was asked how. his plans
could have been divulged, and 'in reply he
suggested' that .some :, traitor./ In the Rue
Royale^-that is.ln the offlceof the Minis

If. In the opinion of all the experts of
Europe and America, your ears are be-
yond help. Investigate this triumph of
science.
If the nerve of the ear is not dead,
then you can hear, and that without the
use of tbe unsightly trumpet formerly
used.
And It may be possible to restore Rome
part nt tbe imw of hearing:.
More certainly do we hold out this
hope If the loss of hearing Is due to
wh&t Is commonly known as ca.ta.rrh.
The following: is a~ sample of letters
we are receiving almost daily:
"San Francisco. September 21, 1905.
â¢XX. W. Fane & Company,

**Oentleine2i:
"About 15 years ago I noticed my
sense of hearing was' less acute, and it
has progressed! steadily until I was com-
pelled to use a trumpet, notwithstand-
ing the fact that I was receiving the
â¢errtces of the best specialists in San
Francisco.
"About a year ago my attention was
called to your Instrument, and although
skeptical as to any benefit to be derived
troza It Z concluded to try It. After
three weeks* treatment so marked was
the Improvement that I decided to buy
the instrument, and have used It since
that time. Three months after I com-
menced treatment I was able to discard
my trumpet, and. although still par-
tially deaf, the Improvement has stead-
ily continued to this date.
. "It is -with pleasure that I make this
statement In Justice to your instrument,
and for the benefit of those similarly
afflicted.
"You are at liberty to use this letter
In any way that will best subserve that
purpose. Respectfully yours,
"MRS. S. A. SOLOMON.

"San Francisco.
"Gentlemen:
**ily hearing has been affected for the
last thirteen years.
"Some six or eight months ago my at-,
tention was called to your Instrument,
and 1 1 commenced treatment with you
on the 12th of May, 1905. The improve-
ment in my hearing to this date Is so
marked as to be noticeable to my
friends and associates.
"I feel that an instrument that can
produce this result in that length of
time should be known to all people so
afflicted.
. "Your, instrument is certainly a boon
to mankind and is entitled to my high-
est words of praise.
"Use this letter in any way your
judgment may dictate.
"Trusting it may convince some one
as skeptical "as I, was." I remain, yours
truly. HANS **ON' EMSLER.

We have now associated with us a

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Sept.; ;: 3.â -Of Hyde Abbey,
where, for -centuries reposed the: bones
of "England's .* darling." Alfred ''( tho
Great, there \u25a0" in little now remaining.
Time's â¢ ravages 'have gone unchecked
and vandalism has . long been ~ allowed
to do its worst on what should have
been treated- with pious veneration as
one of the most sacred spots on English
soiL : : ; But. an r.iort is now being made
to raise a fund to insure the preserva
tion from further desecration of what
is left of its ruins. It is a; significant
recognition of the common heritage
which the Anglo-Saxon race ;; possess
in the memory of the greatest of Eng
land's Kings that the committee hav
ing the matter, in. charge expressly -in
clude, in their appeal" for subscriptions,
"our cousins in the United States.'VAny
reader of these lines in America who
wishes to lend a hand In the worthy^
work should send his contribution to
the treasurer of the fund. Alfred Bow
ker, LankhllU Winchester.
The remains of the ancient . Abbey
are within a short distance of the fine
statue of King: Alfred, by Thotnycroft/
\u25a0which was erected in tha old cathedral
city In 1901 to commemorate the one
thousandth anniversary of his death.
It Is- singular that the occasion did not
inspire a movement at once for the
preservation of a spot so peculiarly
sacred to his memory.- Alfred. had long
cherished an ambition to establish- a
monastery tor the better education of
the children of, the nobles. For this
purpose he summoned the .learned
Grlmbald from France. His purpose
was frustrated . by h\% death. But
scarcely had Edward the Elder suc
ceeded to the crown than he was pub
licly and solemnly exhorted ; by Grim
bald to carry out his father's plans.
Within two years a stately abbey^ was
built at â¢ Winchester and for two'cen
turies was known as the New. Minister.
Immediately after the dedication the re
mains -of Alfred and those of his; wife
Eahlswith were "brought in .solemn
procession from, St. Swithun's and re
interred in the New Ministet.
For a. ". century and a half the New
Minister flourished, though King Al
fred's wish that it should ..become a
great center of learning was never real
ized. Several manors were added to the
possessions of the community. Canute,
the Danish King, who; became so true
an "'Englishman, bestowed upon, it -a
magnificent sjolden cross richly adorned
with precious stones, two great images
of gold and â¢ silver. : and "sundry rel
ics of saints In addition' to the manor
of Drayton. "Hut with ihe coming of
William, the Conqueror . the .halcyon
days qf, the monks departed.' "The- then
abbot.* rcifwy"?.who had succeeded to" the
headship -In; 10C3.- was ..the brother 1 of
Earl Godwin and the uncle of King
Harold. . . _ \u0084 /",
31OXKS BECOME WARRIORS.? "
Naturally he escopused Harold's
cause, but was not content. to give the
King merely his' influence and' prayers.'
He induced twelve of his most stalwart
monks to exchange the Benedictine
cowl for the Saxon helmet; raised and
equipped a score of men. at arms be
sides, and placed himself at their head
on the bloody neld of ; Hastings. â¢, The
Conqueror, of whose "grim .pleasantry
so many anecdotes survive, is reported
to have said 'that the abbot must have
been worth; a barony and the : twelve
monks 'a manor apiece,/ and that such
should be, the mulct' inflicted on the of
fending; community.'
Pent up', in the narrow quarters to
which the act of confiscation restricted
them, the monks endured a long period
of persecution and spoliation. -The
reign of Henry Beauclerk brought them
relief.' They. obtained the means of ex
changing, their monastery;/ within:, the
populous city for a capacious and well
placed edifice .>. > Just - beyond ;â¢ the city
walls. In the;" year 1110 the monks
marched in long procession :to their
new home, Hyde Abbey, carrying with
them their sacred treasures and relics
and the' more precious relics-of .'the
Illustrious dead who had so long
posed .within their: walls. Once again
the", -.body.' . of ' Alfred was carried ;in"
solemn pomp to a new â¢ resting \u25a0 place,
where it â¢ was to lie, undisturbed . even
by. the sacrilegious excesses which so
of ten >\u25a0 degraded the reformation of - the
sixteenth \u25a0 century." it was' now.' to rest
In peace till the verge of the nineteenth
century. and-Hhen'to be rooted :up to
provide- \u25a0â¢ better . ' accommodation .; . for
Hampshire felons!
But the abbey Itself passed through
many vicissitudes Hef ore; that ; crown-
Ing .', desecration .was ; reached. "^Thirty
years . after - its erection.' ; in Uhelcivll
war between . Maud and Stephen,- it. was
burned to the ground when Winchester
was; firecely "besieged and ; much of .the
city' destroyed." vThe tombs .of Alfred
and ':- his Queen, however, ..escaped ;' de-

-LONDON, Sept. 23.â London hotels and
"boarding houses are filled to overflow-
Ing- with- American visitors. - ; ; w' I
-;' Jfever before Jias thÂ« English capital
f Utertalned so . many trans-Atlantic
gtjests'at the sime time..*
: '\u25a0 Tiie overflow from' the f hotels finds
itf"** way to the West End ( boarding;
bosses, but even these, numerous as they
ere, have their accommodations taxed' to
the utmost, i . . . . '
The .'crush is made all the greater
from the fact mat on the mail steamers
nearly all the' berths have been. booked,
from January and February, and those
woo have not taken the precaution of
booking on a" returning, steamer now
fltjÂ«l J^hat they will have to remain sev
erai weeks longer. In London, or .else
pay four- tiroes the usual fare . for a
passage to New York.
"This season ha* Indeed been a rec
ord one," Bald Mr. Pruger, the manager
of -the Sa\-oy Hotel, yesterday.,..- "We
hare over, 100' per. cent more Americans,
etopplng here than has ever 1-, before
been the case, and we are as .full as-
'1 . A Piedmont lot is a profitable investment because for sightliness, climate, proximity to San Fran-
cisco, natural attractions and artificial improvenients no suburb can match iti. r
2. Because the trend of population, as remarkably exhibited in the case of the city of Los Angeles,
is from the cities to Lhe suburbs, and therefore suburban property is a beLLer mvesLment* Lhan
3. Because, if you are a man of family or expect to be, you owe it to your wife and children to
make their surroundings as attractive and healthful and beautiful as possible; a suburb is the place for
to &ow up. v . . f r c .. ' ls\ \. -ir - -^v
4. Because, if you are a business or professional man of San Francisco, you will yourself be better
satisfied to ride on the swift boats and swifter trains of the Key Route that take you to Piedmont than
on the dusty cars you needs must ride upon to reach residences in West San Francisco; the difference
in time is phl^
5. Because the most desirable property in Piedmont is being rapidly snapped up; the time to buy
6. Because the terms upon which an investor or home builder can purchase a lot are unmatched for
fairness and the ease with which the payments may be met by any careful man of moderate income.
7. Because the charming class of neighbors with which any one who builds a home in Piedmont
surrounds himself is alone of inestimable value to any man to whom pleasant surroundings are a factor
in happiness; nice people like nice places, and so Piedmont is a suburb of high social tone.

_ SACRAaiEXTO, Sept. 23.â Joseph S.
Jordan .; has his inning \u25a0on the witness
stand in the ;Emmohs trial this morn
ing, and . he v made' the most of v his op
portunity. :Since7the day that Clarence
Grange, secretary, of the Phoenix Build
ing and. lioanl' Society,' 'testilied that
Jordan had, proposed>-the bribery' of
the Senators. Jordan" has ; impatiently'
awaited; an opportunity, for.' flat contra
diction. On direcf examination- : this
topic was npt touched, but after Jordan
had given an account of his fnterviewi
with" Grange. Johnson "on "cross-exami
nation asked; . V -.:.J. --.;; ;\u25a0;*â¢* "::
. "Was Grange telling the' truth or did
ho commit : perjury?" : >\:
"If he says that I went to him with
this proposition.; asked him for. money
or made any threats, he has committed
a deliberate, willtul, wanton perjury; so
help . me God." : .; .\u25a0' .-.i
\u25a0 The witness was plainly excited, and
he might have continued further, in this
strain,.>but'JohnsQn was .satisfied and
went, off .on another -tack.' .^District i
Attorney Seymour made vehement ob- i
Jcctionto this reply, whereupon John- i
sand said: I
"We have a righ/, to. show what this I
conversation' was, just as the other side
did. v For some reason the District At
torney did not ;a.sk 'Jordan' about his
.talk with Grange. -\ . .; . \u2666
Aside from this the cross-examina
tion of Jordan presented the Jury with
altogether: a different -account of " the
manner In which the roil Jof bills was
passed to Emmous. ''\u25a0 Hartling:, . and
Tlchenor, whoacted as detectives, were
both positive that Jordan'' and' Emmons
were standing sixty feet:east of Eighth
street, on the south "side of; X, :when
Jordan handed the bills to the": defend-;
ant. They were equally sure that the
bills werejinot folded,; but fopen, and
that' they .showed above* Jordan's, hand.
MOXEY GIVEN TO EJIJIOSS. ;
Jordan, however,' declared that he
gave Emmons the bills' In the 'middle
of j Ninth .street on the ', souths side of,
the X street crossing.) Jordan said: '
"As we reached,' the "-middle of .the
street.^ l 'told? Emmons 'that : I was go
ing to bid him; good-by "and that when
I ; shook". hands ; with" hini;l would ; leave
something r in ; his v hand. . Then I r said

OMAHA, Neb., Sept. 23.â The experi
ment of the Murray, . Omahas' leading
commercial hotel, with Japanese bellboys
haÃ proved a complete ., failure. Young
Americans, white and colored, have i been
re-engaged. Five different sets of Japa
nese boys "were tried," but one and all
proved unequal to' the' task. Manager
Hastings, in discussing the experiment,
says: '
"We gave the Jap boys; a fair trial and
have been reluctantly compelled to aban
don our cherished , plans. ; They simply
could not stan/1 the -racket. They /would
go it with a rush for the first day or two;
their willingness was all that was claimed
for It. After the novelty, wore " : off, how
ever, they fell down.:_ They were too slow."
They could not : meet 1 the ; requirements.*

Through the South'
OYSTER. BAY. , SepL 23.âArrange
ments for the trip "ot President Roose
velt through the South practically have
been completed, except thoee pertaining
to his visit to New Orleans and Little
Rock. On account of the prevalence of
yellow fever in -New Orleans it Is not
unlikely that the President^ may defer
Ws visit .to that city until ;a\later time,
in which event he would Visit" Little
Rock at the same time. He is being
urged not to gro to New Orleans so long
as the yellow fever epidemlc'icoriiinues
there, but he has received assurances*
that the fever will .be stamped out be
fore the tentative date of his visit, Oc-.
tober 24. A suggestion was made re
cently that on account of the quaran
tine placed by the authorities of Ar-,
.fcansas on passengers- from New Or 7
leans the President' should .visit Little
Rock before going to New Orleans. This
Idea .is in the minds of the Arkansas
authorities.
It was announced , officially to-night
that if the quarantine regulations of
other States shouldprevent the Presi
dent's entrance into Arkansas or his
having visited New Orleans, he "may
consider the plan of making New Or
leans the final stop on his trip and re
turning from there to Washington by
eea; However, no definite plans have
) For Monday Qnly

List of Student .Af
fairs to Be Allowed
SOPHOMORES ARE HURT
Class Burlesque Is Among
the Events That Fail to
Meet With Official Favor
I BERKELEY, Sept. 23. â President
Wheeler to-day made public the list of
college events which classes anil uni
versity student organizations will . be
permitted to take part in this year. Th*
list was prepared by the exeutlve com
mittee of the Associated Students and
submitted to President Wheeler as the
result of a decision made last year, by
students and faculty both, that too
many college activities were permitted,'
their number being so great as to inter-"
fere with the proper work of the stu
dents.
In the list, as approved by the presi
dent, there fails to appear- the sopho
more burlesque, the Skull and Keys
running and the Press Club banquet.
Practically all of the social, musical,
dramatic and sporting: events ordinarily
Indulged in are on the schedule ap
proved by Mr. Wheeler. The number of,
senior assemblies is reduced from four
to two.
The sophomore class is preparing to
hold an indignation meeting to protest
against the cutting out of their annual
burlesque. Last year the burlesque was
called "Hamamalet," was produced in
the Macdonough Theater in Oakland
with success and was to be repeated in
some form this year. President G. Bar
nett of the sophomore class and Harry
Englebrlgbt, one of his chief lieuten
ants, declared that a sophomore bur
lesque certainly would be held and that
the class would meet at once to discuss
the matter.
Eugene R. Hallett, private secretary
for President Wheeler, explained that
the Skull and Keys' running was proba
bly omitted from the list of approved
events because it Is a fraternity event,
calling for no especial time of work on
the part of any large part of the stu
dent body. He is a Skull and Keys man,
and assured all anxious ones that there
would be a "running" this year, m
heretofore.
The complete list of events approved
by President Wheeler Is as follows:
September 22, Mask and Dagger vau
deville; 29, the University Dramatic
Association lecture by Elmer B. Harris,

All Efforts of Captain Han
sen to Float the Vessel
Prove to Be Unsuccessful
NEWPORT, Ore., Sept. 23.âThe,steam
ship ,W H. Harrison struck -on .the -bar
while trying to enter Alsea on v Friday.
She .was later, driven on the south spit
by a heavy sea, where she' now. lies about
a quarter of a' mllel from . shore.'; ?: The
members of her^crew are all safe, but the
vessel and cargo . will undoubtedly oe a
total: loss.
The Harrison was bound , from , Umpqua
for.Alsea with a full cargo of canned sup
plies.: She reached' Alsea' Bay on Wednes
day morning and fodnd the sea* breaking
too heavy: to. attempt: to enter. and came
on to Yaquina to wait for a favorable op
portunity.
Friday, finding the sea had smoothed
down, . Captain , Hansen sailed " again r; for
the port of. destination. ; When off the en
trance"he found the sea moderate. He de
cided <\u25a0 to come in, but.- the vessel struck
hard on. the bar and all efforts to get her
off have failed. _ ' \u25a0 . ; ' ' : â¢
Part of the crew launched a lifeboat
and reached . the shore safely. \u25a0 Captain
Hansen ! and- two;- sailors . remained" with
the - steamship until < to-day, when \u0084 they
were removed â¢" by ' the life-savlng.- ! crew."
The vessel, is . badly strained" and',' her
stern post is nearly gone. ;It is 'expected
that she -,wlll go to pieces ' during^ the
night, as the sea is rising.

Plans of Magnate to Return

Contrary <to the general - understanding.
President . E. H/* Harriman and â¢ his party
are not aboard the' steamship Korea,
which =is due here \u25a0\u25a0 Wednesday : next with
Secretary Taft's' party. It was learned
yesterday, that the Harriman party, which
includes. the members of < his family, Rob
ert* Goulet " and wife of New,. -i-. and
General Manager Sen werin' of the Pacific
Mall Steamship Company, will return to
San Francisco on the > Siberia, ;arrlvln.s
here about October 22. ' \'~~
. Harriman, before leaving San Francisco,
had hoped *to return; on the ...orea and
had cabled for : accommodations on . that
vessel. He was disappointed, however, by
the. receipt of a message 'saying that tho
best cabins on tho big: boat had already
been reserved for theTaft party. As' tbÂ«
steamship Coptic. '". which follows tho -Ko
rea from the Orient, does not possess ade
quate accommodations for a princely par
ty like Harriman' a the railroad magnatÂ«
cabled to reserve all the' upper suites oa
the \u25a0 Siberia"' for . himself and ; friends . and
added . the Instructions that the vessel
shall 'cut Honolulu out of the voyage and
endeavor to "* make' a ; ; record trip. -. This
means that Harriman is going to put tho
Siberia's * engines to a * thorough test for
speed,' and coal will not be spared In grat
ifying the desire of tho Wall-street finan
cier.
The day. . the Doric left San . Francisco
last week a cable. was received from Har
riman to forward all his mall to the Ori
ent and the last freight that went aboard
the liner before ahe steamed out into tho
stream were several large bags of corre

a announcing the death in* Santa; Barbara"
Friday 'niyht -of E. Ii. â¢ Pansbaiwe^ whose
father Is *a "prominent. brok4rli tnV New

Young Fanshawc died at the Hotel
Arlington' of blood "poisoning, the' re
sult of a playful blow received while
scuffling u-ith a friend *on ' board the
steamship 'Doric during" hen' last {trip
to this' city, from' the: Orient! With" a
party of friends. Including A. W. Hard
Jr., S. S. Lawrey and William B. Rand,
all of Kew York, Fanshawe was making
a tour of the world." They crossed the
Pacific from Yokohama on the steam
ship Doric and during the voyage had
a merry time.
â¢ One afternoon Fanshawe, who wore
Classes, and one of his party started
to box with a view of knocking, off
each other's hats and during the scuffle
Fansha.we received" a blow on. the
bridge of the nose, which was cut by
the rim of his glasses. The bruise was
followed by a slight Irritation, which
caused Fanshawe to call for rhe ser
vices of Dr. Noble when he arrived at
the Palace. At no time during. Fan
shawe's stay in San Francisco was his
wound regarded as serious and when he
left for Santa Barbara on a visit sev
eral days ago it . was expected , that
\u25a0within a few days lie would' be able to
remove the small piece of court plaster
on his nose.
Two days ago, however, his compan
. lons here^were surprised by the receipt
( of a telegram that Fanshawe was very
iow with blood poisoning in Santa Bar
bara. Arrangements were immediately
made for a hurried trip to the south by
Dr. Herzstein and several other' local
physicians, but as they were about to
Etart on "their trip yesterday a message
â¢was received at. the Palace .-Hotel'--an
nouncing' young Fanshawe's death.

TRADING STAMP
ACT IS ILLEGAL
Supreme Court -Holds Anti-
Premium Jja w^ of Last Leg
> islatiire Unconstitutional
EIGHT OF CONTRACT
Tribunal Finds No Merit ; in
Provision That Articles
Given Must Be Identified
| The Supreme Court has declared that
the ' trading 'stauip/act of March 7. 190*.*
\u25a0Is unconstitutional. This decision was
handed â down by the court yesterday
morning. Judge McFarland writing tho
; opinion.. The decision was concurred In
by; Judges 'Angellottl.liorisan. Shaw.
Van Dyke, Kenshaw and Chief Justic*
Beatty. '.-'
This is an absolute victory for thd
firm!' here who have oeea n?htlnj tho
act and. now n.ll those desiring to uau
trading stamita can do so to their
heart's content .without fear of arrest.
. ;The* cause Of- the 'passage *of ., the 'act
was the desire of ' the Merchants'.; Asso
ciation and the.; Retail. Grocers' Associa
tion'to do away with the stamp trad
ing business. These .two associations
took hold of the matter and hired coun
sel to draft a bill that would stand the
test ; of \u25a0 the courts.
In the East statutes designed to
auollah/the trading stamp directly were
declared unconstitutional by tho courts.
In view of ,thta the' California opponents
ofjtrading stamps sought to reach thw
matter in another way and keep within
the ; bounds of constitutionality. In thla
they! have failed-- . . \u25a0
-The act 7 of March 7 in this State was
distinguished from similar acts of other
States, in': that it provided against; tho
sale! of trading jtamps only where an
unidentified or unselected arttcle wa.3
given as a premium.
The Supreme Court sees no difference
in the, California act from anti-trading
â¢ stamp "acts passtd in other States. Tho
constitution. clearly give 3 to all the
right to: contract, the. court says, and
decides that the California act 13 in vio
lation or such, right- â¢
The; petitioners. . Charles F. Drexel .
and J.^C. Holland, are dischargod from
custody . <^NB
: The decision Is a lengthy one, cover
'ing over 4500 words. It" closes
follows: " . \u25a0 'â¢ \u25a0 . \u25a0 : ; ... â¢
â¢'Indeed, -an "ordinary trading stamp
or coupon is;' hi substance, a' mere form
\ol allowing discounts on cash payments,
and; iUU lssuance Is : entirely.: harmless
and 'within "the .constitutional* right or^
contradt.^ It may be" distasteful to cer
tain competitors' In "business, but the
latter should remember that If a statute
"suppressing it 6e upheld.' then other op
pressive statutes might be enacted un
lawfully," interfering with and hamper-
Un? -businesa-and ;the right, of contract
: tb**whlcKt these* competitors would
strenuously but valnJy; object."
"Our conclusion's that the . said act
of March*- 7, 19fo. so far as It undertakes
to'mako the issuance/of trading stamps
and coupons such; as were, used by tha
petitioners herein a misdemeanor. Is un
constitutional and void."

Only one 'record -was broken during
the meet and that was done in 'the
two-mile run Â«by Garvin^of \u25a0 Lowell* in
10:45.: The closest race of -the day was
the 440-yard dash,' in which' Mackinson
of Lowell beat Crabtree. of Lick byone
inch. It was so close .that : some time
elapsed before the Judges could * de

sprints, failed to- come .'through with
a.) point.! According to "dope,"- '/ Butts"
should have taken; both the hundred
and the-two-twenty, but hearing of the
notoriety, of^the Lowell man, Miller ran
with more ;. determination - than ever,
beating '.his former .attempts by a fifth

Harold Maundreil, who ran with his ac

When Announcer Billy. Jordan-intro
duces Al Kaufmann" in the, ring at
Woodward's on Thursday! night the big
Olympic Club boxer will get a' great
Â»end-ojr. Every one is asking, how the
a.:r.ateur champion' will conduct himself
Ts professional society. It is also asked
freely who will be Kauf mann's next op
ponent in the event that his professional
career should be lengthened by, a" deci
sive victory over the -shifty Harry Fo
ley. Altogether Kaufmann is being
talked of a whole lot by, those who are
known as fight followers and fans.
t In the meantime, while his future ca
reer as a pugilist' is being discussed at
length, the big champion is putting. In
hard licks at his training quarters over
In . Oakland. , was a busy
day at the Kaufmann camp. After the
road work had been dispensed with in
the forenoon Al had lunch. Then came a
short horseback ride of a few, miles out
toward "Point Richmond. At 3 o'clock
he began 'his Indoor work, which took
tip the greater portion . of . an hour and'
consisted 'of the usual exercises. His
boxing -and heavy bag punching were
perhaps the features of the day's exer
cises and Billy Delaney was elated over
the marked improvement in his pro
tege's breathing.
Harry Foley still continues to draw
good crowds at his training quarters at

work has impressed those* who - have

UDCEKXE, Switzerland, Eept. 23.â T0
pay & visit Xo o-ucerne I* . to discoverâ or
perhaps it would be better to cay-re
discoverâthe story of TelL Tell
Is. of course, the hero of all Switzerland,
but It !s not until one reaches -this region
that a sense of his practical ignorance
cf the patriot's history and achievements
is zncEt ap: to overtake him.
, It was. on the day after our arrival
V^re that we took the Email steamer that
,-^ans from Lucerne to Fluelen, at the
nhei' end of the Lake of the Four Can
ions. Many are the poets that have sung
.his lake,- which, with its depths of limpid
irreen Into which the sun seems always
to shine, Its. surrounding snowcapped
mountains and its fringing, toy villages,
is surely one. of the " most fascinating
stretches of water on earth*. One "goes
to Fluelen to reach the Axenstrasse, that
picturesque road cut. at many points,
through the eolid rock, which passes over
and beneath the St. Gothard railway and
overlooks the green expanse of the .ake.
We passed Wegrgis and Vitznau,
where- the world-renowned Rlgi Rail
- -way begins its ascent of the mountain
sJde. and. finally, reached -Brunnen. the
village at the end of the Axenstrasse
nearest Lucerne. And then,' close by on
the left bank a* the steamer forged
her way from' the Brunnen pier, half
hidden -by the pines that fringe the
mountain Bide, there came In view a
small building of one story, spired and
Jilted with large, tiny-paned windows,
which at the first glance struck the
eye familiarly. Naturally enough, too.
since It ha*s been pictured in painting
; and lithograph the world over!
"Tellskapelle!" . ejaculated the Ger
mans In front of us. "Tells Chapel!"
caurmured the little English woman at
cur elbow.
Tell's .Chapel, of course. Erected,
one remembered, by a grateful nation
in commemoration of one of the deeds
&t the Swiss hero. But -which deed?
jE^eourse was had to the faithful
and the Information speedily,
elicited that the chapel stood* on the
historic Â«pot where the savior of his
" country leaped from Gessler's boat.
%Vhicn c ;Â»pas inspiring - enough, if only
one happened to recall who "Gessler"
v.es and under what circumstances the
hero "leaped." Thus it was â three.or
dinarily, well- read people â that our
ignorance of Tell first arose and
Emote us!"
BIRTHPLACE OF TELL..
We became conscious of it again on ar
-iving at Fluelen, and learning that, only
aalf an hour's ride away, was not onjy
Burglen^the village where Tell saw the
light, but Altdorf, in whose public square
the bowman shot the apple off the son's
head. That mention of .the apple set us
ton firmer ground at once. Everybody
Tcnows that the hero was forced into at
tempting :that heartrending trial of his
marksmanship and has heard in imag
ination the boy's cry of "Shoot, father,
shoot:" But who was it that commanded
the attempt, and' why was it done? â¢ We
put these cuestlons to one another, each
deprecating his companion's ignorance
ar-d attempting to excuse his own. We
all liked to think that: we had known.
ence. And our embarrassment - became
deeper when we learned next day that
one of the most charming : excursions
from Lucerne by steamer was to Kuss
nacht, near which town Tell slew Gess-.
ler. â¢ ' ; ..--.
But our ignorance was not so dense
that we were not aware that the 'story
ef Tell had been made the basis Tot
Arioug epochmaking works, . including
opera and , Schiller's > playâ
S:d the latter proved easy, to ' obtain.
It may be remarked, too, that V the re
g-ion about here abounds Â»in; places
where Schiller may be read under un
usually pleasing circumstances. We
read It Jn a , romantic little Swiss
"gasthaus" â or inn â with . the lake arid
the mountains that figure so promi
nently in the story spread before our
eyes.
In Schiller's pages we first see Tell,"
the sturdy countryman and patriot,, res
cuingâat. the peril of his own;iife~-a
victim of the foreign oppressor,, by, car^
rying him across the lake In the midst
cf a terrific storm. This is â¢in ISO 7,
when Albert 11. \u25a0 Duke of Austria and
German Emperor, wm striving to an
nex the forest cantons to his immediate
possessions. And .so we came to Gess
ler, the Duke's vogrt, or steward, and
personal â¢ representative â the -TVeyleriof
the time and -author -of innumerable
atrocities. Gessler ", lorded It , at Kuss-.
nacht on the southern arm of. the lake
cf the Four Cantons, but the true seat
cf Government appears *to. have been at
Altdorf. inland from Flaelen, and close
to Burglen. where. Tell lived with his
wife and his two small-, son*â - Walter
and William. ; - -'.â¢--â¢, " â¢
n'CEX SED . AGAEVST TELL.
It was Gessler's Ingenious Idea to stick
the ducal hat of Austria' on a pole In the
market' place of Altdorf that it might be
/touted -br - the~ citizens. And , Schiller's
Atoelodious blank verse tells -us how WII
1 ilam Tell and his son, Walter, passed by
without notictns the hat, % were â¢ promptly
set upon by Gessler'a s mlnlona, and how
the t>Tant himself, appearing 'upon the
scene and being already incensed- against
Tell for his rescue of the hunted forester,
commanded the shot at an apple set "on
his son's .head Â«s the- price of the lives
cf both father and son. . .:',',/
Uow the shot was fired we learn, and of j
GesEler'e pertinent query as to the, use
'which, the crossbow man intended to make .
of the* second arrow, * which , heVootJced
sticking In hii -belt and ready to hand.
Also Tell'a reply: \u25a0'\u25a0;

An answer; which "so exasperated ..Gess
ler that although he, did spare Tell'slile;
according to -his ' promise,* he straightway
condemned him to solitary, confinement in'
the prison at Knssnacht and prepared to
convey him there "In his own \u25a0 vessel,
which lay J at anchor; in Fluele^ harbor.

â¢was that ' Tell * was " made * free ;of \ his

It just ; after reading * the j play,, as if no;
stone or twig of it had been altered "in.
all those hundreds of years. It Is true
that a motor car, broken down at the
side of the road, proved rather an anach
ronism. At the top of the "Hollow Yv ay '
stands another ' Tell , chapel, which com
tains a painting of the death of. Gessler
and also one of Tell's death, which over
toolt him in the act oi having a child who
had fallen into a mountain stream. , It
is a fine ' ride on the ', lake steamer, from
Lucerne to Kussnach t, and jj the . town it

HEAVY DEALS
AT THE CLOSE
End of Week -.- Session on
â¢New York Stock Market
Marked by Great Activity
PKICES V.VKY LITTLE
Large Distribution of Hold
ings. Is Effected During
Final Rush of Business
NEW YORK, Sept. 23.â There were
very, heavy transactions to-day In . a
number of the most prominent active
stocks on the list: The business looked
like an active absorption of these is
sues. That the offerings to realize were
Quito strictly commemsurate is suf
ficiently indicated ' by the small net
changes in the .prices at the end of
the sjort cession- The majority of
these showed losses. That a large dls
tr*oution of holdings was effected is
the impression created. The movement
was Irregular, but prices advanced
with some aggressiveness before the
appearance of the bank statement on
the supposition that It would make a
favorable showing. The closing ten
dency, however, wr.s easy. The bank
statement showed a decline in reserves
about as large as the extreme prelimi
nary estimate. The contraction- in the
loan item afforded the necessary relief
Irom the. deposit liability and afforded
a nominal increase in the small sur
plus reserve. \
Large arrivals of" gold In Lonfion
were all â¢ secured : In the open market
lor export and this had a depressing
effect on securities in London. ' It could
not be learned that any part' of this
told was taken for New York. : The
movement Is looked upon as likely to
cause an increase next week in the Bank
of England discount rate. ; The heavy
demands to be met by the money mar
ket next in the meantime are . the
ground for some apprehension. ' Total
sales of bonds, par value, J3.030.00C.
Stocks have made headway this week
against the constraining Influence of
the doubtful money outlook and * some
of the Immediate developments in the
money situation have been toward re
lief of the drain upon banking reserves.
It Is every noticeable that the principal
movements have been in stocks in
â¢which the existence of speculative
pools is notorious or in stocks which
Â«re readily susceptible to manipulation
by reason of the small floating supply In
the market. ~ Much use has been made
also of vague and unconfirmed rumors
of deals and of old reports" revived
after having already exerted a marked
Influence" on' prices In stocks affected
come time ago. This has given the im
prerslon that the participation in the '
dealings was that of professional oper- <
b tors to a large \u25a0 extent. Commission
houses, in fact, continue to complain
of light business and that the general
public persists "in holding aloof.
The money, situation remains the only
drawback in the general outlook. Ad
vices from all other sources are of ex
traordinary prosperity, which scarcely
call for specification. Railroad- traffic
is of unparalleled volume. "A buying
rush" is the term used to describe the
iron situation. Railroads are placing
enormous orders for various kinds of
equipment. The course of the week
has resulted In nothing unfavorable; to
the progress of the crops. The firm un
dertone of the. stock' market is, abun
dantly explained. by this situation.
The bond market has been. dull,. but
has shared the firm understone . iof
ctocks. P^>j9SSW49P^

BANK STATEMENT.
Surplus Reserve Shovt^ Increase â¢ After
a Loec Period ot Deellme.
NEW.YORK, Sept. 23. â The' Financier
Bays the most notable feature of the
statement /" of the New York associated
banks last: week was' an Increase- of
the surplus reserve, after a continuous
dfecline 6ince August . 25, and this not
withstanding there was a cash loss last
week of two " and three-Quarter," mil
lions. This more favorable condition of
the banks so far as the surplus was
concerned was due, as was the case \u25a0in
previous weeks, to a" further.': contrac- i
tion in loans and consequently"lnide
posits and reserve requirements. Note
worthy that the decline in loans "\u25a0 since
August 5 : has amounted to $69,723,100,
the loss of cash was $36,065.750 "and the,
decrease in deposits $116,649,100, .the
cash reserve Is now. at the lowest point!
of the year. Loans last- week were
contracted by $9,383,200 and most likely!
this was the result of liquidation .of
speculative accounts on the* stock mar
ket, for such movement was actively
In progress during the greater part of
the week. .The cash loan was $2,689,
Â£OO. which amount differs .materially
from the-, preliminary â¢ estimates ; that
were based upon the ;" traceable move
ments of money: the reason for the'dls
crepancy between the estimates and the
bank figures are incapable of explana
tion. Deposits were reduced $13,157,400,
â¢which amount \u25a0n-^s greater by. 51,086,000
than the turn of decrease In loans and
the loss of cash, therefore the - state
ment failed to prove, 1 . The required re
serve against general deposits was de
creased . $8,359,300. ( deducting ' from
_which theloss of cash' left $599,750' as
me increase in surplus 1 reserve "to'
$5,255,025.' Compared an ' the basis of
deposits, less those of $8,658,400 of pub
lic funds, the" surplus Is J7.399,350." \u25a0
