"He is burning to read the letter
Avhich Serjovâ If Serjov it wasâ brought
to him,".. Volborth thought. "And, the
contents of that letter i must learn
before he does, if possible.".
It was no easy, task, to conjure a let
ter from the tightly buttoned 'tunic of
a man separated from him by three feet
of dinner-table, but these matters were
Volborth's specialty, and he did riot
despair. Fortune favored him, in one
respectâ since, the .change of waiters
Boris had been drinking fast â and he
decided on a bold stroke. '
* What reason?" stammered Boris, ey
ing him with a: fierce curiosity now,'
and unconsciously raising his hand to
/.the breast, of his tunic, but dropping it
instantly.
"It Is rather a delicate subject, and
must be kept strictly between our
selves," resumed Volborth, producing
from' the pocket of his civilian frock
coat a- packet of letters, from which he
selected one that had reached' him at
Vienna â a report on some trifling mat
ter from a female - spy of the section.
"This is an anonymous communication
â¢of a very flattering nature received by
me yesterday. f The only person â¢ to
whom I have shown it pronounces it to
be in the handwriting of the Princess
Olga." ; -
Boris essayed a scornful laugh, but
his face was working with: a Jealous
anger.-: . v
"Whoever told you* that told'you. a
lie," he snarled, glaring round the room
as though in search of the culprit. 1 ; *'O1

'of genuine* amusement" at .thetthought
;that that share i might' have served as
here"â and In his zeal to confound the
double lie he pulled an unopened letter
from, his tunic." "This is Olga's writing.
Compare the two,- and confess that your
informant lied."
So are traps laid for the unwary. It
was now 'Volborth's turn to reach over
for the letters, and they were at once
surrendered - for his . inspection. Plac
ing them beside his plate he affected to
compare them, arid he saw. that the
letter, received by Dubrowskl was fn Ol
ga's writing, with 'which he was really
perfectly familiar.' The envelope bore
no stamp or postmarks, the inference
being, that It had been inclosed under
cover tb the individual who had deliv
ered It. His own letter. had also been
an , iriclosure, so* that the two differed
only in the writing.
This discovery as it stood was valua
ble', but how to get a sight of the con
tents: was the problem. : In erder. to
gain time, while freely admitting that
.the, letters could not have' been written
by the same hand, Volborth went on to
descant upon' the salient points of dif
ference, and he * wa s making ,- Boris
laugh with ridicule of the fictitious ac
cuser, when he saw his chance. -

"That is no 'more Olga Palitzln's

Boris when he discovered the "mis

-His grasp had already closed on his
own letter, and he was reaching for the
more important one, when a set of
taper fingers almost touched his own,
and lo! the precious missive was spir
ited away. Regaining his seat he was
just in time to see lima handing the
letter to Its rightful owner."
"You were about to give it to Boris,"
said the ma id-of -honor, regarding him
with a E-.veet smile. "In saving you the
.trouble I -have made amends for my
mother's accident, have I not?"
"You have more than done that,
mademoiselle," replied Volborth, both
'literally and figuratively showing his
teeth a little. "You have placed me un
der an obligation which I shall do my
best to repay."
Every one laughed at what was taken
for an exaggeration of- politeness in
tended to be amusing, j But Ilma's ex
pressive eyes showed that the real sig
nificance of the reply was not lost upon
her; and thus even In the moment "of
his defeat Volborth scored a minor vic
tory by. satisfying himself that his dis
comfiture was no. freak of chance. In
his love of keen fence he would have
liked to congratulate his fair young
antagonist had the issues been less tre
mendous.
The Countess and her party passed
on. and a minute later the clang of the
warning bell -told him that further de-
"Well," proceeded Volborth, "see the
effect upon this son of the South when
he hears his native tongue." And turn
ing to the new waiter, he gave him the
scroll, and instructed him in Italian to
take it out on to. the platform and hand
it to one of %he Russian officials, on
duty near the imperial saloon. He care
fully'abstained from mentioning Res
tofski by name, confident that any
agent who might receive it would j at
once pass it tojiis nominal chief.
Grinning with delight at the, sound of
his own language, the Italian sped on
his mission, and returned Immediately
with news of the note's safe delivery.
In the meanwhile, in order to prevent
Boris from speculating on the man's er
rand, Volborth had harked back to
what he knew was. a "sore subject"
with his companion, plunging into a
dissertation on the discomfort of being
accompanied by ladies. He soon- saw,
however, that this little stroke of chi
cane was "unnecessary. BorisÂ«was too
intent on his own thoughts, and. judg
ing by the haste 'with which: he. was
eating and drinking, in too v great a
hurry to finish his dinner to revert- to
that grievance. He answered In' mon-
But above all these considerations the
urgent necessity. remained of at once
warning Restofski that there might be
a dangerous Nihilist In the vicinity of
the station, if not actually In the build-
Ing. The barest outline of what had oc
curred, if such could be conveyed to his
trusty lieutenant, would be sufficient to
ensure the adoption of the right mea
sures, and Volborth was not long at a
luss for means to communicate. Pen
ciling a few lines on" a leaf from his
pocket-book, he remarked casually to
Boris, as he folded the paper â
"You do not speak Italian, I think?"
The aide-de-camp, still silent and
abstracted, replied in the negative.
Volborth has placed it on record that
never in his career has he been so near
to giving way to uncontrolled anger as
at the moment when he had to sit there
and hear the signal given over the
wrong man. For, being now more than
ever anxious to conceal his connection
with the police from Boris, he could not
excite remark by again leaving the
room to institute Inquiry. Yet the wai
ter's sudden disappearance conflrmed
not only the suspicion mat he was
Serjov, but strengthened the suspicion
that his engagement had been planned
with a definite purpose. That he'had
only excused -himself from further at;
tendance when that purpose was
achieved, in the handing of a letter to
Boris, Volborth was fully convinced.
"It was all right, you seeâ the .Bern
hardt souvenir," said Volborth, resum
ing his seat.
"Ah, here is the salmi of quail. But
where is that rascal of a waiter? He
has run away again, and there is no
red pepper."
Boris muttered something about the
man having been there a moment ago,
and suggested that he had gone to fetch
the condiment. All the sparkle and
grayety had left the young officer. Vol
borth, though scenting blood like a ti
ger, was as cool as ever. It was not till
he knew that Restofski must have been
at the window fully a minute that he
simulated the natural indignation of a
gourmand whose dinner was spoiling
for want of a necessary adjunct.'
"Here," he cried, hailing a passing
waiter, "where is the fellow who is at
tending to us?"
The man expressed ignorance, but said
that he would summon the head stew
ard, who promptly arrived, swelling
with importance, to inform "their ex
cellencies" that the waiter , who had
been attending jupon them had been
taken ill and had obtained leave to go,
but that he would immediately detail
another man to their table. The stew
ard was true to his word. A fresh wai
ter came bustling up, his appearance
being hailed by three gentle taps on the
window cane.
Volborth hastened back to the dining
room, not forgetting to take from his
pocket the gold cigarette caseâ a pur
chase of his ownâ which had done duty
as an excuse. On re-entering. he saw
that Boris, with his eyes on the door,
but Immediately averted on seeing him,
was tucking something into the breast
of his undress tunicâ something thin
and white, suspiciously like a letter.
The aide-de-camp's manner had under
gone a change. He seemed ill at ease,
and hardly smiled when the cigarette
case was triumphantly waved before
him.

sume my seat, come and take stock of
the man who Is. waiting on us. You
will get the best view through the

Serjov tap softly three times on the
glassâ if you identify him do nothing
until orders.- There Is such a clatter
going on that no one not listening for
it will be likely to hear you tap. If It
is heard it won't much matter, as I
have purposely arranged for the audi
ble signal to be given in the event of
your pronouncing the man harmless."
Automatically Restofski nodded com
prehension. One of the cherished hopes
of his life was to track down the man
who had mutilated him; but not by the
flash of an eye or the quiver of a mus
cle would he own to personal anticipa
tion.
"You know Serjov by sightâ the
same who was suspected with good
cause of arranging the bomb outrage
at Warsaw in '94?" he asked.
"Better than I know you," was the
rep!y. "Have I not this to remember
him by?" And Reetofskl held up. his
left hand, short of the third finger,
v.'hich three years before the desperate
Nihilist had bitten off in successfully
resitting arrest.
"Well, I never saw him," proceeded
Volborth. *'But there is a: man in
there acting as waiter, who. Judging by
photographs only, might be Serjov dis
guised. I want you to have a look at
him. but without allowing him,' or Du
browski, with whom I am dining, 'to

But it was not to the compartment
In which he had* traveled that he
turned his steps. Making his way to
the group of section agents, who were
keeping guard over the imperial sa
loon, he beckoned Restofski aside.
"Save the divinity's souvenir, by all
means; here's to her health," cried
Boris, rai&ing his champagne glass.
And Just as the waiter returned with
the two silver dishes, Volborth " hur
ried out on the platform.
Suddenly in the thick of this inter
change, when the waiter had gone for
the entrees, Volborth sprang to his feet
and uttered an exclamation of dis
may.
"That reminds me!" he cried. "I
would not lose it for ten thousand' ru
bles. Excuse me for two minutes, my
dear Boris, while I run to the train for
the gold cigarette case presented to me
by Sarah Bernhardt. I have left it on
the scat in the saloon carriage, and who
knows but Bome railway, man may
take a fancy to it." . â¢
The influence of the brilliant lights,
glittering plate, good wine, and the
splendid military music which Austrian
hospitality had provided as a send-off
to their guests, temporarily cured
Boris of his ill-humor, and he chat
tered in the highest of boyish spirits of
the good time they would all have in
Paris. The French capital was re
tarded by the whole staff as the para
dise of the pilgrimage, to which the
formalitif-g of Vienna and Breslau, and
the dull domesticity to be expected at
Copenhagen and Balmoral, formed the
purgatory. Both men knew their
Paris, and each vied with the other in
recounting reminiscences.
A waiter swooped down on them
with the menu, presenting it first to
Volborth, who had taken his seat with
his back to the wall so that he could
see what was going on. Having se
lected his dishes and whispered them
into the ear of the bowing waiter, Vol
borth passed the carte to Boris, who
sat opposite, and the man, with well
drJlled alacrity, crossed over and bent
down at the side of the second diner.
Thus, while Boris was ordering, Vol
borth got his first full view of the
waiter at fairly close quarters.
Like the other carefully selected
servitors, this one was spick and span
in swallow-tails and snowy shirt-front.
But unlike the others, who were mostly
dark-skinned Italians from Istria, he
had a complexion of .dull brick-dust
color, that made a bad match to his
shock of coal-black hair. It was a face
which by the usages of nature ought
to have been surmounted by locks of
a more ruddy hue.
Volborth leaned back and lazily
scanned the man as he gave an obse
quious ear tb Dubrowski's require
ments, and in doing so he became
aware that he was himself being sub
jected to a similar process by the wai
ter. Not directly, by any means; but
there was an alert watchfulness at the
corner c-f the man's eye that Volborth's
training told him was not entirely for
the "work in hand. The same furtive
watchfulness was perceptible when the
â¢waiter returned with the first course,
but Volborth abstained from adding to
any uneasiness under which he might
be laboring, and affected not to notice
him further.
"I share your sentiments, Paul, to the
letter," he said as he seated himself.
"It is to be devoutly hoped that her
Majesty will remain in the mind which
rumor attributed to her â to desert the
tour at Kieff, and take her pack of
pussy cats back to Petersburg. They
are a nuisance in affairs of this kind.
Traveling makes them nervous â and
-they scratch."
THE old lady, still refusing to see
that anything was wrong between
the betrothed couple, had kept a
place for Boris at her side in the
Improvised restaurant, though he had
studiously avoided mother and daugh
ter during the day, and now turned his
eyes in search of a seat in any direc
tion but theirs.
"Here you are, Dubrowski, here is a
snug corner," said Volborth, seeing the
position, and steering the all too willing
young officer to a table at the opposite
end cf the room, at which there was
only space for two. "Let us dine to
gether en garcon. I have been making
"myself polite to the women all day, and
I confess to feeling a little blase of the
charming creatures."
Boris tried in vain to tone down a
truly Russian guffaw- eloquent of the
mood which Volborth had so adroitly
tickled.
THIS is the second install
ment of "By a Hairs
Breadth," which has al
ready begun to attract more
attention than any novel
published in The Sunday Call
since its new literary policy
â¢was inaugurated, possibly be
cause it shows how niarvel
ously the Czar is safeguarded
by Russia's Dreaded" "Third
Section.*'
Apart from that there is
the merit of getting a new
$1 50 book complete in four
installments at the small
cost of 20 cents.
well as the one he was setting. "The
writer, whoever she Is, flatters . me in
the, same way as those others have
been doing recentlyâ by attributing ' to
me police functions. Assuming my In
quisitorial capacity," she- warns me
against one of the ladles 'of the suiteâ

browskiâagainst \ Mademoiselle Vassili.

trothed with revolutionary leanings."
"The writer lies vilely! lima is above
suspicion of- that .sort," Boris exclaimed,
his better ' self asserting itself to de-'
riounce what heknew was a false ac
cusation against an innocent girl. And
then, as' Volborth had expected, the
thought must have crossed his mind
that of all people In the world Olga Pa
litzin had most Interest in vilifying li
ma were she base enough to do so. "He
did not believe that she was so base,
but he was all eagerness to convince
himself that she was notâ again Just as
Volborth had expected. "Show me that
writing," he said.
Snatching the letter Volborth handed
to him. he elanced at it and broke into
w,ay.to,the.door..they would have to
pass. dose. to the table at which Boris,
and Volborth were sitting. . The latter's
quick eye noted that the Imposing pro
portions of the Countess took up most
of the si>ace in the alley way. between
the tables. He so contrived - that in
passing Â¦heshould Jerk his elbow, with
the result that both the letters, which
he had taken in his hand with' the ap
parent intention of returning them to
Boris, fell to the floor. At the same
time, to all seeming from the same
cause, a cup of black coffee at his side
crashed down on the letters, copi
ously staining them .in equal propor
tions .with the dark fluid.
Instantly he stooped down to recover
the letters, hoping that amid the babel
of apology and explanation, which as
he had loreseen promptly arose, and
also because of Ilma's presence, Boris
would forthwith put away the letter
which he would pass to him. _ This
would not be the one from the Princess,
and the substitution would be facitita
ted by the coffee stains. The contents
of his own letter being in the cipher of
"That grove which you "see to. tQM
left,", he said, speaking rather loudly.
Having in turn informed Restofski of
what had happened In the dining-room.
Volborth hastened back to rejoin Boris,
and he quickened his steps when far
down the long vista of the platform he
; saw the aide-de-carnp under one of the
station lamps reading his letter. A
fresh, ruse for possessing himself of It
had already half formed In Volborth's
mind, and then . he was suddenly
brought to a standstill by a hand on
his shoulder and a voice In his eaj>
"Whither away so. fast, stormy pe
trel?';. !
The speaker was Prince Lobanof. re
turning to his own compartment. from
the Imperial saloon*, where he had been
dining.
"I have very urgent business. If your
Excellency- will excuse me," Volborth
replied, directing the Prince's gaze to
the distant Boris. . :
"Ah!" said Lobanof. ."There arÂ« new
developments, then? . Getting serious,
eh? Well, I will not detain yonJ?. -
And the distinguished Minister passed
on, little thinking with what-conse
quences that twenty seconds' delay was
fraughtâ to himself most of alL "When
Volborth turned again' toward,. Du
browskl the latter was tearing .thÂ» lat
ter into a thousand pieces with tho air
of having thoroughly mastered the eon
tents. The next moment he stepped
forward and flung- the fragments Into a
brazier. of live charcoal, thus once; for
all preventing the communication from
being seen by any one. Â¦ . aiZ'
Baffled for the second time that night,
Volborth refused to accept final defeat,
and set himself to the only possible way
of learning the contents of the letter â
that of beguiling the information from
Boris himself. The train started imme
diately, and he stuck close to the aide
de-camp, following him into the smok
ing-car, and subjecting him to every
subtle device that human ingenuity
could Invent. But it was all to no avail.
By no means he could employ, direct or
circuitous, could he bring Boris back to
the letter. In fact, the you;ng officer
had Imbibed so freely at dinner that he
was disinclined for tete-a-tete conver
sation of any sort, and was soon the
center of other lively young blades of
the staff, who kept things going merrily
till bedtime. When the attendant came
to say that the sleeping berths were
down in the gentlemen's car. Volborth
was not one whit the wiser.
All through the summer night the
Â¦Imperial train rushed across the fertile
Oaliclan plains, stopping nowhere but
at Jaroslau, and, two hours later in the
gray of dawn, at Lumbers, where Vol
borth stole from his car,-, while every
one' was sleeping, -to seek a few^worda
with the ever-wakeful Restofski. Here.
,too, he Inquired for a telegram which
was duly forthcoming and informed
him that the Introduction which had
placed Anna Tchigorin on the stage at
the Hofburg concert hall was de
nounced by the St. Petersburg Im
presario as a forgery.
At 7 in the morning the frontier sta
tion of Radziwillow, flanked by Its
chain of frowning forts, was reached,
and the familiar uniforms on the plat
form told that the Tsar was on the soil
of his own holy Russia once more.
Thence the train sped onward to
Sdolbunow, where, while tha engine
was changed, breakfast was served In
the cars.
Every one was about again now, the
ladies- in fresh morning toilettes,- and
the military members of the suit*. In
full-dress uniform, ready for tha state
arrival at Kleff In the afternoon. Vol
forth had contrived to efface all "traces
of a nearly sleepless night, and was ap
parently- in .the most careless high
spirits; but -Boris had lost the Jerky
noisiness that had marked him . over
night, and seemed either dull or.pre
occupied. Volborth fumed Inwardly.
He would have given half he possessed
for the next six hours to be over, for
with the Tsar safe In Kleff, hedged In
by all the normal precautions of the
section, as only possible on native
ground, he himself' would be like a boy
let out to play. .He has since stated
'that at this period of the Journey so
overwrought was he with a sense of
foreboding that* at the slightest" sign
of anything tangible he would <have
abandoned his secret policy, and would
have handed over the sullen, j silent
aide-de-camp to Restofski In the police
car.
But he could not well order an officer
of the Emperor's staff into arrest for
having a strange manner, and the de
sire to spread his net for the real crim
inals helped him to master himself.
There was always, too, the thought of
the consternation which an open course
would bring to the imperial travelers.
And presently his self-control was as
sisted by Boris himself, who gradually
thawed during the forty-mile run from
Sdolbunow to Scheptowka. and -by the
time the. train stopped at the latter
place was chattering gayly once more.
"Perhaps he awoke In Ul-humoVfrom
the â¢ wine he drunk at Cracow. , On the
other hand, he may have been puzzling; >
out some problem which he sees clearly
at .last," Volborth thought, as he
stepped from the car to stretch his legs
with the rest of the suite. To his sur
prise Boris, on whom he was in close
attendance, at once went up to lima
and commenced to walk the platform at
her side. Volborth perforce fell back a
littleâ but not far.
Scheptowka is on the edge of Â«the
Russian corn land. The landscape was
one vsst expanse of golden wheat ripen
ing for harvest, broken only by a wood
of lime trees half a mile from the sta
tion. Outside the iron railings a troop
of filthy emigrants squatted in the dust,
patiently waiting till the autocrat
whose realms they "were, leaving should
. have paused oxi. The conversation with
which Boris began volubly to entertain
lima had reference.. It seemed to no
thing more important than these de
tails of scenery. . ' rw ",
As he came opposite to the great
green and gold saloon he halted sud
denly and pointed to the wood. Yj.*. \, :
â¢igns upon thÂ» latter must bÂ» post
poned. For Boris 'rose and went out on
the platform, where Volborth had to
leave him In order to confer with' Res
tofskl before the train started. Ha
found his colleague, waiting: at the pre
viously appointed rendezvousâ a lamp
room at the end of " the stationâ and
learned that the inquiry set on foot
about the supposed Serjov had led to
no enlightenment. Restofski had seen
the head steward of 'the Austrian re
freshment contractor, and had gathered
that the man had been engaged, with
many others, especially for the occa
sion, on the best of credentials. . A mes
senger had been despatched to the ad
dress which he had given, but had re
turned with the report that no one an
swering to his description was known
there. For the rest, nothing had oc
curred during the stay of the train to
signify present danger:

CHAPTER V.
THE FORSAKEN ROOM AT BRES
LAU.
The hall of the Hotel Golden Gans at
Â¦Breslau was full of loungers. The cap
ital of e German province, as distinct
from the more fashionable Bads and
watering-places, is usually a center of
dullness, enlivened only by the freaks
of local politicians. But on this occa
sion Breslau. having waked to its Im
portance as the meeting-place of two
Emperors on the morrow, had grown
quite cosmopolitan. Journalists and
sightseers, diplomatists and a good
sprinkling cf the secret service element,
had invaded the capital of Silesia, ab
sorbing every corner of its limited ac
commodation, and turning it Into a
babel of tongues and a medley of na
tionalities.
And, omitting minor points, Vol
borth ran through the heads of his dis
coveries and suspicions, commencing
with the Princess Palltzln's enlistment
of Boris Dubrowski as an instrument,
and laying special stress on the part he
believed lima Vassill to be playing.
"Can you conceive," he concluded,, "a
state of mind In which a girl, while
knowing her lover to be In tow of a
rival, and despising and loathing him
for it, would yet move heaven and earth
to save him from the section. Mind

tescue rose and extended his hand, the
smile broadening into a grin.
â¢ "How do you do, Herr* This is In

The new-comer, a portly, elderly man
in the ill-fitting, shoddy garb affected
by German provincial bankers and
merchants, drew himself up as one who

started in astonishment, his eyes de

"I ze bleasure not haf der know you.
saar. You one great mistake must
make," he replied.
Fortescue's eyes were abrim with
merriment. .
"Very, well done, my friend, that Ger
man-English was excellent," he said,
taking care not to be overheard. "But
seriously, my dear Volborth, though I
know three years and my beard must
make a difference, you have not for
gotten Spencer Fortescue and the little
affair we worked together at Belgrade
in *93?"
"Pull your table out of earshot from
the door. *I will be back in a moment."
was the reply, spoken now in excellent
English.
The seeming merchant disappeared
into the hotel, and Fortescue acted on
his suggestion, moving the table and
two chairs into greater privacy. He
was still smiling to think that he, him
self unrecognized, had penetrated the
disguise of the redoubtable Volborth.
in close association with whom he had
engineered a delicate matter of interna
tional haute police three years before.
The rising young attache was one of
the very few outside the ranks of the
Third Section who knew Volborth in
his true capacity, and between the two
there had arisen a firm friendship,
which, though they had never met
since the completion of their joint ser
vice, had been kept alive by a mutu
ally useful correspondence. Each had
formed a very high opinion , of the
other's absolute secrecy, and they
trusted ope another accordingly.
In a minute or two Volborth re
turned and seated himself at the table,
using gestures in conformity with his
dress, but plunging into conversation in
his natural voice. â¢
"We cannot be overheard with this
blank wall behind us," he said. "Be
fore you say a word. Spencer, tell me
how you spotted me. I flattered my
self that the make-up was perfect."
"Quite perfect â If you could only con
trol the droop of that left eyelid," safd
Fortescue, passing his cigarette-case,
which, however, Volborth waved away
in favor of a heavy German pipe. "Do
not alarm yourself," continued the En
glishman, perceiving a trace of real an
noyance oiu his friend's altered fea
tures. "It was probably what we call
in our trade 'a concatenation of circum
stances' that cave you away. I dare
say I should not have noticed the droop
of the lid If this had not been more, or
less a Russian function, and Paul Vol

start at the sight of me, though you

"Do you mean to say that you con
not guess?" said Volborth, puffing his
pipe between each word as though to
the manner born. "Xo? Well, with that
beard you are the very counterfeit of
my august sovereign, the Tsar. The
difference is perceptible' at close quar
ters, but at a little distance the resem
blance is amazing."
"An undoubted honor, but a doubt
ful advantage," laughed Fortescue.
"And now, old collaborator," he added
with a quick cha'nge to gravity, "is
this tour running smoothly? I know
you won't tell me more than* you ought,
but your presence here in advance
seems to signify trouble."
"Yes. there is trouble â bad trouble,"
was the reply. "They nearly scored In
Vienna. Andâ this is "very secret,
Spencerâ Lobanof is to be credited to
their account, though the Empress was
the Intended victim."
"I am not surprised," said Fortescue.
after a pause. "I saw the hand of the
section in the meagerness of detail sup

"Unquestionably. That Is why I pre

berg*s roof, and if that could be pre

This was neither more nor less thaa
to save Boris Dubrowski from further
implication, while at the same time
helping Volbrcth to prevent a criminal
attempt without publicity. Though
Volborth had not said as much. It was
patent to Fortescue's diplomatic mind
that Prince Lobanofs death had placed
his friend in an awkward position.
Should it come to the Tsar's ears that
his faithful old minister had lost his
life, and that the Empress had had the
narrowest of escapes, as the, result of
Volborth's waiting policy. It might go
hard with him. And this difficulty was
increased by the fact of Lobanof hav
ing been the only oo* irtio could have
testified to the motlres that actuated
that policy, after consultation and ad
vice. It was therefore probable that
it would be to the future action of Du
browskl that Volborth would look In or
der to prove his connection with the
conspirators.
Fortescue told himself that It would
be no breach of confidence on his part
to/ hinder such action, on this occasion
at least, seeing that by depriving De
laval of his opportunity he would be
aiding Volborth's paramount objectâ
the stoppage of open attempts while
preparing a swooy on the conspirators
at the end of the tour. In coming to
his conclusion Fortescue was greatly
influenced by the presence of the Eng
lish detective, who might be trusted
They both laughed, their relations be
ing such as make the jest appreciable.
"No, I am not jealous," Fortescue re
plied. "But all the same, it is the
Yank over whom I am grizzling. Do
you know that, with the best of inten
tions, you may have sot lima Vassili's
lover into an uncommonly nasty
mess?"
"Good gracious, no! How?" exclaimed
Laura, her face the picture of alarm.
"In this way. Leaving aside the
question of outrages, there is the
chance that this American may be us
ing Dubrowski's name, unauthorized,
for purposes of his own. It may be
only the ruse of a wealthy man to get
what he would call a 'front seat at the
show.' But Russian court etiquette is
a truly fearful thing. If It ever came
out that the name of an Imperial staff
officer had been made use of in that
way, whether Jsy his permission or not.
it would be bad for that officer. And I
can think of at least twenty ways in
which it might come out."
Laura's eyes filled with tears at the
bare idea of damaging her beloved II
ma's fiance. "What a donkey I have
been!" she cried. "And the brutes
would really make it hot for Captain
Dubrowski, even if no harm came of it?
Well, I'm off to put the matter right.
I shall te'll the Baroness it's all a mis
take â that Delaval is a suspicious
character, and mustn't be admitted un
der any consideration. If he gets into
the house it will have to be over my
dead body. Come and see metome,
Spencer, and back me up."
"I am aware that you were born a
long time before yesterday," replied
Laura. "But why this thusness? You
have come over as solemn as a mau
soleum. It isn't anything I've done, is
It. old boy? You are not jealous of the
rich Yank?"
She looked up, wondering why that
elderly, vulgar German had started up
so excitedly from his chair at the closa
of a narrative which, she had Imag
ined, could have no special concern for
him. Fortescue, too, was surprised
that his friend should have left the ta
ble so abruptly, with a half-muttered
apology; for it was not like Volborth
to be taken aback by the most unex
pected of combinations. And then a
glance at the opposite sidewalk, to
ward which the disguised spy was has
tening, told him that Laura's uncon
sciously offered Information, startling
as it was, did not form the immediate
cause of the sudden move. That cause
was revealed in the lithe, active figure
of Inspector Melton walking fast on the
other side of the street.
"Herr Wlnckel has seen another
friend, it appears," said Fortescue, as
Volborth accosted the English detec
tive, and after a hearty hand-shake
paced slowly on with him. "And now,
little woman," continued the attache,

so she just did nothing. But she firmly
refused him admission to the house,
and that's where the Joke comes in.**
"May we Inquire how?" said Fortes
cue.
"Why, the Yankee is coming back: he
is to have the room after all, and the
funny part is that I am at the bottom
of it," returned Miss Metcalf. .not no
ticing the start which neither of her
hearers could wholly suppress. "The
Baroness had a wire from him this
morning to that effect â about a hun
dred words, though, of course, that's
nothing to a millionaire. He says he
had got as far as Boulogne on his way
back, when he recollected that he was
chummy with one of the Tsar's staff,
and that he was returning in the hope
that that would cause the Baroness to
alter her mind. The staff officer vraa
thrown In as a voucher of his respecta
bility, don't you see? It wouldn't have
weighed a bit with the Baconess, and
the poor Yank would have been home

me." And Laura made a tantalizing
pause for effect.
"We are waiting for the climax," said
Fortescue quietly.
"Here It is, then. Luckily for the
prodigal Yank, he gave the name of his
Russian acquaintance, and who should
it be but the Captain Boris Dubrowski,
whom my dear lima Is going to marry.
Of course, that made it as right as
nlnepence for the porkpacker. and the
Baroness means doing him well. His
name is Delaval â a colonel, it goes
without saying. Hullo! Where's the
Herr off to?"
"Run back to the wood and arrest the
priest," he said. "Make no bones about

â¢ Five minutes after the Tsar's great
servant had breathed his last the men
returned. They reported that the priest

to return to the station. Volborth still

as they were nearing the station,
Prince Lobanof staggered, recovered
himself, staggered again, and would
have fallen had not the Tsar, against
whom- he lurched, held him up. The
court physician pushed his way
through the throng, and willing hands
bore the stricken man to his saloon car
riage, but almost before they laid him
down a whisper ran through the awe
struck suite that the Prince was dying
â of heart disease.
Volborth, who In the confusion had
somehow possessed himself of the bas
ket and roses which Lobanof had
dropped, slipped away, white as a
sheet, to where Restofski was standing,
quite satisfied with the success from his
point of view of the little excursion.
The section did not worry about "death
by the visitation of God." But at the
few words whispered to him by his
chief he too turned pale, and summoned
three of his assistants.
â¢"See:" he cried gayly, "the good
priest's roses have thorns. Even at my
age it has been permitted to me to shed
my blocrd for your Majesty." And he
pointed to a red drop oozing from one
of the fingers with which he had
clutched the basket.
'.Having answered the questions put to
him about the shrine, and explained
that the roses were for sale to pilgrims,
be selected the best basket and begged
the Tsarina to accept it. Just as her
grasp was about to close on the handle
Prince Lobanof intervened, and, seiz
ing the basket, insisted in his courtly
fashion on carrying it back to the train
himself.
The stroll along the dusty road was

to the refreshing shade of the grove,

fox hounds do a covert â and drawing it

In which he went on arranging several
baskets of roses he did not seem to
know his distinguished visitors. But
at a few kindly words from the sover
eign he rose to his feet and made low
pbeisance.
The . allusion was to a well-known
bobby of the TSarlna, who. since her
â¢"conversion," had developed a mania
for collecting Images of the Russian
saints. No sooner was the Emperor's
intention known than Volborth con
trived a word with Restolskl.
"Take care," was all he was able to
say. "This notion was Inspired by our
young friend." V
He also questioned a railway man,
and gathered that there certainly was a
.shrine of Saint Gregory in the wood.
Somewhat reassured by this, and by
the cloud of section officials who spread
themselves round the party, he at
tached himself to Boris and lima, and
followed the imperial couple out of the
station with the whole suite.
"We will ourselves test the value of
your reading, captain," said he. "Her
Majesty is making' a study of eikons,
and a little sightseeing will break the
monotony of the Journey.**
."Bo I have read, Eire." replied Boris
firmly. "I cannot speak from knowl

"Captain Dubrowski," eald a pleasant
but authoritative voice.
A. window of the imperial car had
been let down with a crash, and a face
appeared which caused a general hush
upon the platform. Every man's hand
went to his headgear in salute; every
woman curtseyed Jow. Behind the
Tsar stood the Tsarina, with Lobanof,
who had been summoned to a confer
ence, smiling benevolently in the back
ground st the sudden impulse of his
sovereign. Boric advanced, clicked his
.heels, and stood to attention.
"We chanced to overhear your
words," said the Tsar. "There is, then,
an elkon of great age in yonder wood?"

"I have private sources of informa

that he Is out of Breslau,"' Fortescue
said. "On leaving here he drove
straight to the station, and an English
detective, who la believed to be after
him for another matter, went by the
same train. So he may be laid by the
heels eventually." He did not tell her
what he had gathered from Volborth
â that the brief conference which the
latter had had with the Scotland Yard
man had convinced both of them that
they were hunting on the same scent
after striking it at different points.
Further conversation was cut short
by a roar of cheering outside, and
they hastened to join Lady Metcalf
and the Baroness at the wlndoW. The
stately procession ..of court equipages,
with its brilliant escort, was In sight,
but owing to the throngs of spectators
it was some minutes before it drew up
at the door of the Stadthaus; and for
Laura the real Interest of the arrival
did not begin till the Kaiser, having
set down his guests, had driven off,
and the carriages conveying the Rus
sian suite came up in quick succession.
. "See, Spencer!" she cried. "There
is lima. in the third carriage with her
mother. How pale and tired she
looks! .* Ah; now she sees us and is
smiling." And Laura waved her
handkerchief in true British fashion,
as the beautiful maid-of-honor kissed
her hand toward th"e window. Then
the Russian ladles passed out of sight
into the building, leaving Laura to
speculate as to which of the officers
who followed could be Boris Du
browski. Spencer did not attempt to
aid her. 1 but he made a shrewd guess
that lima Vaftsili's fiance was the tall
young guardsman who descended from
one of the rear carriages, accompanied
by Volborth' in proprla persona.

trumpets and the roll cf drums, as the
Westphalian Hussars, who were to
form the escort, rode by on their way
to the station. While dressing as
quickly as possible, she debated with
herself whether she should tell Fortes*
cue of the event of the night, and she
decided in the affirmative.
"It's more than likely that Herr
Winckel will tell himâ on the strict q.
t., for. I believe the' ol<J boy is to be
trusted," she said to herself. "Any
how, I won't have any secrets from
Spencar."
And an hour later, when Fortescue
called / to view the arrival from the
Baroness' windows, and gave her an
extra pressure of the hand, she guessed
that he had heard of her doings al
ready. As a matter of fact, he came
straight from breakfasting with Vol
borth, who had now discarded his dis
guise, In order to rejoin the suite at the
station, and he had listened to what
his friend had to* tell him of Laura's
discovery with mingled feelings. Proud
and pleased as he was that she had
shown such unconscious courage, he
was annoyed that her devotion 6hould
have defeated its own object. All he
could hone for was that she would
never know it.
was on that- account that he had
watched the house, intending to gain
admission for the purpose uZ search on
the first sign of life tn the morning.
What had happened under cover of the
night was better .luck than he could
have hoped for, as had he made the dis
covery himself In the light of day it
would have been almost Impossible to
keep it secret. Yet, with Laura Met
calf's truthful eye's thanking him, the
advantage, which none, the less he
meant to use ruthlessly, palled on him.
. "It is jiot the blace for gombliments,"
he said, simulating a Teutonic rude
ness. "Of this box I shall dispose, if
you will make light for me the stairs
with the gandle."
The 'Journey to the front door was
safely performed, Volborth carrying the
portmanteau. When he had passed in
to the shadows of the deserted street,
after assuring her of his discretion,
Laura replaced the fastenings and re
turned to her room. In ten minutes
she was sound asleep, dreaming of a
gorgeous e'eremony in which lima Vas
slll was led to the altar by an Impos
sibly handsome officer In a uniform o'f
sables and astrakhan. â¢
"How's that for tact? Shan't I make
an Al embassadress?" cried . Laura.
turning to the others when the door had
closed on him. But only her mother
heard her, for Forteacue was speaking
in a low tone to the Baroness; who had
just rung for a servant.
"Two portmanteaus, I think you
said? Thank you. It may be as well
to verify their departure," was his
comment, wholly incomprehensible to
the Baronass, on her reply to his ques
tion. And he stationed himself at a
window, whence a few minutes later he
watched the American superintending
the bestowal of his two portmanteaus
in the cab which had been summoned.
\t the same time he caught a glimpse
t Inspector Melton, driving slowly by
\ ' a second cab which quickened its
pace in pursuit as the first, bearing De
laval, drove away.
"Good! He will be well looked after,
but it will .be only fatr to*Vo!borth to
post him on what has happened." said
Fortescue to himself, as he turnedMo
make himself agreeable . to the ladies.
But as Eoon as he conveniently could
he took his leave and retraced his steps
to the hotel. Volborth, however, had
not returned, and he sat down to wait,
after ascertaining that "Herr Winckel"
had engaged a room and was expected
back to dinner. 'Â¦<'V-V r
"Pray, don't eay another word; I
wouldn't discommode ladles to double
my dollars," the Amerlpan replied. "If
the Baroness will kindly. have a cab
called, I guess I'll clear in a brace of
shakes. I don't think a tall heap of
your reasons for asking me to quit, but
that don't count. I am sorry to have
intruded, and I bid you all good-day."
Fortescue. watching closely, had no
ticed a change come over Delaval's
countenance as he understood what
was lequired of him. The smile re
mained, but the danger signal had dis
appeared, leaving only an 'amused tol
erance for girlish Ignorance. The
young attache was puzzled by this ob
vious scoundrel's freedom from annoy
ance at an enforced change of pro
gramme.
"Well, then," proceeded Laura, "you
arc probably aware that he is to marry
Mademoiselle Vassili. She is my dear
est friend, and naturally I take a great
interest in her future husband. I have
been told by an experienced person â a
person of the greatest experience In the
world" (Delava! here transferred his
srin to Fortescue, with a touch of in
quiry), "that he will get into trouble
if you stay here on the strength of his
acquaintance. Of course. It's only silly
Russian twaddle, but there's no Retting
away frc-m it. It's horrid to have to
ask you â epeclally a friend of his, you'
knowâ but couldn't you relieve us of
yourâ of our anxieties, I mean? There's
the Goldne Gans, or they might take
you in at the Nord."
"Boris and I are like brothers," was
the reply, uttered with no relaxation of
the previous manner.
"'I reckon you've no call to do that.
Miss. Colonel Delaval stands right
here â at your service," said a voice at
the door, and amid gasps from the two
elder ladies, Laura turned to face the
subject of her uneasiness. Fortescue
did not move a muscle, but he held
himself in readiness. There was an
ugly grin on the man's face which he
did not like. The American looked as If
he expected trouble and was prepared
to mett it with bravado and perhaps
violence. It was the grin of a savage
uog threatened with the stick by a
stranger.
But Laura was too intent on her pur
pose tv heed his looks. She meant to
pet rid of himâ civilly if she could; If
not. as she mentally told herself, "he
must havÂ«Â» the other thing."
She began sweetly enough: "Oh, how
do you do, Colonel Delaval. You are a
friend of Captain Boris Dubrowski, are
you not?"
ing to his lug-gage, which has Ju6t come
from the station on a handcart. He
ha? brought two great portmanteaus,
and must mean to stay a month." . '
"He won't stay a single hour," sajd
Mits Metcalf with decision. "Forgive
me. Baroness, but I brought this on
you. and I am poing to get you out of
it. Will you kindly ring at once and
send for Colonel Delaval."
ile Is now upstairs, attend-
â¢'I firid that I have done the most
dreadful thing, dear Baroness,"- she
cried. "You mustn't on any account
allow that American to stay in your
house on the strength of Captain Du
browski's name, or the captain will be
in An awful pickle. It is quite on the
cards that the man' is an impostor, or
something worse, and I ought never to
have persuaded you to take him in."
The Bareness â a faded lady with
lymphatic blue eyes and a nervous af
fection that wag almost St. Vitus*
danceâ started up in much trepidation.
"But he has already arrived!" ehe ex-
to see that the American was not lost
sight ofâ wherever he might go after
failing at Breslau.
In such haste was Laura Metcalf to
withdraw her indorsement of Delaval
that they were soon at <he door of the
Von Lindberg mansion â an old six
teenth-century building Hush with the
strct-t. and nestling against the more
imposing structure in which the impe
rial visitors were to bo lodged on the
morrow. Fortescue followed to the
urawlng-room. where Lady Metcalf and
her hostess were sitting, but on hla

Baroness, with whom he was already
acquainted, Laura's impetuosity cut
him short.
young lady in the pretty pink dressing
gown had asked him to help her down
stairs with a box of millinery she could
not have shown less excitement.
"There is an infernal machine in the
chimney against the Stadthaus wall,
and I can't get it down," she began.
"If you will come upâ you must take
care- not to wake anybody â perhaps
you will be more successful. Your arms
are longer than mine." * . Â¦ <
"Ach! then yourself have tried?"
said Voiborth, nearly forgetting his
German-English In admiration. "How
know you the machine to be Infernal?"
"Well, people don't shove portman
teaus with clocks in them up chimneys
for nothingâ when . there's a big-wig*
like the Tsar putting up on the other
side.".' said Laura. "I have seen and
touched it, I tell you."
"But this is an affair of the police.
Why 1 you not them, call?"
"Yes, you have a right to ask. but it's
wasting a lot of time." sighed Laura.
"Because it must be kept dark, Herr
Winckel." she went on emphatically.
"Russians are perfect beastsâ all except
one, possibly twoâ and for the sake of
those two I want to prevent, any nasty
-weaka of - Russian spies from poking
their noses into the business. The man
who put the portmanteau there 8fot into'
the house by using the name of an offi
cer who is engaged to my dearest
friend. Why, you heard rne telling
Spencer this afternoon. There would
be the dickens to pay for Boris Du
browski if the Russian autnoritles fer
reted it all out." . \
"Ach, yes, and I am to help you place
on the ferrets a muzzle," said Volborth
with a*> grim smile curling the corners
of his mouth. "Lead on, Miss Metcalf.
I come with you."
No more words passed between them
till they stood before the fireplace in
Delaval's room, when Volborth took
the candle from her- and waited.
"Well, why don't you go on?" said
Lawa. "Don't tell me you're going to
funk, there's a dettr soul."
* "Yes, I vunk, as you call him, for
you," replied Volborth, wondering If all
English girls were cast in this. mold.
"You to the end of the house must goâ
var away. " There may be accident.".
For" the first time Laura showed ex
citement, and it took the form of
righteous indignation. "That's all torn
my!" she said, relapsing into her best
emotional slang. "Do you think I've
brought a nice old gentleman like you
into a job of this kind to let you stand
the racket by yourself? You may want
a hand. Besides, if that thing bursts I
expect it will be as bad at one end of
the house as the other." \
She had raised her voice a little, or it
is probable that Volborth would have
protested further. 'But for his own
very different reasons he was as anx
ious as she was to remove the portman
teau secretly,' and 'he feared that an
"argument with a lady of such spirit
might arouse some light sleeper*. Turn
lnsr awny. he imperceptibly . crossed
himself and tackled his
* For five minutes little else was to be
seen of him but his back and legs and
his left hand holding the candle. Laura
remained by the bed. watching him.
At last his body was very still, but af
ter a while it began to sway, then to
sink downward, and one shoulder re
appeared." At this moment she heard
him sayâ
"Take the candle. It is coming down.
I want both hands." >
She flew to his assistance, and gin
gerly and inch by Inch he steered the
heavy package down into the grate. To
lift it thence on to the hearth rug was
comparatively easy. Neither* of the
strangely assorted pair spoke a word,
for each knew .how much depended on
the next few seconds. Volborth pro
duced a bunch of master-keys, and, the
lock being of common make, he. raised
the Hd at the third attempt, showing
the interior to be divided into a large
and a small compartment. In the lat
ter the "works" of an American clock
were .ticking merrily in connection with'
a percussion attachment; the larger
compartment was closely packed with
squares of an opaque substance.
Still* in silence, Vilborth, after a keen
scrutiny, placed, his thumb under the
percussion hammer, and with his other
hand violently wrenched the mechan
ism out of gear, with the result that
the hammer fell limp and harmless on
his thumb. "The spring-power being
thus rendered useless, he removed the
clockwork and shut down the lid, ris
ing immediately, to face Laura with a
smile of triumph. Now that the strain
was over there were tears in her eyes.
"Herr Winckel, I should like; to kiss
you," she said simply, thereby occa
sioning Volborth one of the few
morseful pangs he had ever felt. He
hated to think that the effect of his
"assistance" would really be to thwart
the very object which had prompted his
fearless comrade In that deadly peril to ;
call him to her aid. For, the moment
he had heard from Fortescue^ with
whom he had dined, of Delaval's" will
in? departure, he had suspected that
some crime had been- prepared -which
would renew his grip on Dubrowski. It
The absence of a clock she had^al
ready noticed, but she verified it by an
other tour round the furniture, and
then stood still again, to listen. There
â¢was no doubt about Itâ somewhere
within a few feet of her clockwork was
in motion. In that deathly stillness the
regular tick-tack was distinctly audi
ble, though in the day, time, with the
traffic rolling outside, It would have
passed unnoticed. So dull and muffled
was the sound that it was only- by
changing, her position several times
that she was at all able to locate its
direction, and when she did fix the spot
where she heard It loudest there was
nothing to account for it. If there
could be such a thing as the ghost of a
clock she would have imagined^ that
thfere was one ticking spectrally o'n the
mantelpiece over the great cavernous
fireplace.
And then a. flash of enlightenment
came to her. The clock was up . the
"Mother is a little 6tnrchy to-night,
but she'll be all right by morning. And
as for Spencer, I suppose he's worrying
round with some of those German po
tentates. He will get onâ that youth
â If he sticks to business so tight."
Having thus summed uj> the deficien
cies of the evening, Laura dismissed^
them from her mind, and, exchanging*
her dinner dress for a dressing-gown,
sat down for half an hour ever a novel
before getting into bed. The name of
that author., so far as these records are
concerned, has not been preserved," but
he would be a proud man did he know
that he was the direct cause of this
particular "dear reader" getting her
chance as a very practical sort of
heroine.
So absorbing was the book that the
half hour was multiplied by four be
fore Laura put it downâ to find that it
was past twelve, and also that she was
singularly wakeful. Whether it was
that the exciting incidents in the novel
had fired her imagination, or that some
hidden power was leading this plain
spoken, open-hearted English girl into
the thick of as dangerous a plot as was
ever hatched in Europe, the effect was
the same. She fell to thinking â collo
quially, as was her habit â of ' # 'the Yank
whom she had chucked out," and from
thinking she gut to wondering whether
he might not really have been "up to
no food."
"He didn't look like a nice man, yet
he took'hlB gruel very kindly," she
mused. "It almost seemed as if he
didn't mind going a bit. Can it have
been because he had done the trick,
whatever it was. already, and was glad
of the reason for getting away? Per
haps I saved him from having to hatch
up an excuse of his uun."
And then she recalled the unwonted
gravity of Fortescue's manner toward
her when he suggested the possible re
sults of allowing Delaval to remain at
the Von Lindberg mansion. .
â¢' 'Leaving aside the question of out
rages.' were the words with which
Spencer began his homily," she said
to herself. "That's diplomatic .for
meaning that an outrage was just what
he expected, for my coming embasBa
dor simply reeks of caution. Let me
see; the Yank was alone In his bed
room for over half an hour. I think
I'll have a private Guy Faux inspection
before I go to bed."
Quietly opening the door, she stepped
out into the pasage and stood listening.
Not a sound was to be heard, and be
yond the range of the wax candle
which she had taken from her dressing
table everything was in darkness. The
house was en oblong block, with no
intricate windings, and she knew just
where to find the room that had been
Allotted to the Americanâ at the end
of the passage farthest from her own.
With Laura Metcalf to decide was to
act. and half a minute later she stood
in the center of Colonel Delaval's de
serted apartment, ' holding her candle
high over her head.
After the first glance round, which
revealed nothing but ancient furniture,
faded hangings, and a huge canopied
bed, Laura nearly laughed aloud at the
thought that she really did not know
what she had expected to, find. The
room had evidently been tidied up since
its brief occupation. This was an oper
ation which the temporary guest would
certainly have foreseen, and however
sinister his designs, he would hardly
have left what Laura thought of as
"gunpowder and things" strewn about
to be swept upby the impending house
maid. It did not appear that, he had
left so much as a hairbrush. The wall
adjoining the Tsar's lodgings was sol
idly* intact, and obviously no attempt
had been made to burrow through the
gloomy fireplace in the middle of it.
. Having come so far, Laura was not
the girl to go back Without a thorough
search, and it was not till she had
k;oked under the bed, opened a worm
eaten clothes press, and tried all the
drawers that she stood taking a last
look round preparatory to departure.
And then, suddenly, in the stillness, of
the night, an unexplained sound fell up
on her ears. Somewhere close at hand
a clock was ticking faintly, yet in the
room no timepiece of any kind, was
visible.
The culprit herself, conscious of hav
ing "done her best to get Ilma's young
man out of the scrape," entered her
bedroom with a cheery smile at the
prospect of seeing her beautiful Rus
sian friend, if only for a few minutes,
on the morrow. Her health nnd tem
per were too sound to let her trouble
about Lady Metcalf's frigid looks, and
having no nerves to speak of herseif
she had failed to notice the shaken
ct-ndltion of her hostess. She was a
little disappointed that her lover had
not looked in to coffee, as he had half
promised, but even on that score Â¦ her
mental balance was proof against irri
tation.
ter in dealing with the supposed Amer-*
lean millionaire. ' It savored a little too
much of free-and-easiness to suit old
fashioned no-lions. And the Baroness,
though too fond of Laura, whom she
had known from childhood, to be of
fended, had received an unpleasant
shock to her nerves.
"What on earth can he be doing
there?" she murmured. "He must be
using the lamp post as a stepping*
stone to his hotel after dining too
freely, I fear. But no! He is- sober
enough; he has seen me, and Is looking
up at the window... If only I felt sure
that he was to be trusted."
- She drew back a little, remembering
that her candle made her as visible to
the man below as he was to her. Then
with a quick impulse she went forward
again and beckoned, pointing to the.
front door, and trying to indicate that
she was coming down. Her gesture
was acknowledged with a nod, and as
she disappeared from the window she
saw'the midnight lounger quit his post
of vantage. Two minutes later, after a
struggle â as silent as she could make it
âwith the Baroness' bolts and bars,
Laura wan facing "Herr Winckel" on
the doorstep.
"If you are real friends with Mr. For
tescue I want your help," she whis
pered. "It's nothing to do with him,
but I'm engaged to him, you know, and
if you do me a good turn you do him
one, eh?"
"To serve Mr. Fordescue will only
lees bleasure be than to- serve his brom-
Ised wife," replied Volborth.
"Come in, then, and step softly," she
whispered, closing the door, and lead
ing him Into the dining-room, where
she inspected him critically by the light
of her candle. "I think you are strong
enough," she said, "but how about your
pluck? I hope you are very brave."
"You try me and see.. Germans is not
gowards," replied Volborth, tapping his
chest.
There was something quietly assured
in the tone which, desuite his elderly
make-up and fantastic English, won the
girl's confidence, and she proceeded to
take him at his word. It is doubtful if
in all' the great police agent's experi
ence he ever heard a communication
that so astonished him. The revelation
itself, though he .was on the lookout for
something of the kind, was sufficiently
startling, but it was the manner in
which it was made that nearly took his
breath away. If this ! self-possessed
German friend,
Laura's first instinct crn rising was to
alarm the house and leave the respon-.
sibility of subsequent action with the
Baroness von Lindberg, whose plain
course W would be* to send for the police
arid have the ominous obstruction're
moved from the chimney before the
Tsar's arrival next door. This duty
the police would be sure to supplement
by diligent inquiries after the Baron
ess's late guest,â and Laura at once
grasped the .terrible significance which
her discovery, would have for Ilma.Vas-
Kili. In. self-pfotefiUon.' if not for the
sake of truth aha justice, the Baroness
would have to say: that Delaval gained
access to. the house as a professed
friend of Boris' Dubrowski. â¢
"That will never do," she thought.
"I must get # 1he. thing down myself
rather than that. Perhaps I could take
out the works and smuggle it awayâ
after making it harmless."
She sank down on her knees again
and thrust her hand up the chimney,
but though she could just touch the end
of the portmanteau her arnv was not
long enough to get a grip on the thong
handle at the lower end.
Once more she rose, this time nearly
in despair. At . the same time the
cathedral clock led off the concert of
chimes from Breslau's many churches
announcing the hour of 1. In eight
hours the Tsar and Tsarina wcruld be
refreshing themselves after their long
journey on the other side of the wall;
"I will not have, the police called,
but I must have help," she told herself.
"It's a case for bribery and corruption,
but whom can I find to corrupt at this
time of night? I cannot fetch Spencer
Uj help me. Hie career in the public
service would be< ruined if s he- were
mixed up in this.' Besides, the thing
might ro off."
She walked, abstractedly to the win
dow, and drawing aside the curtain
looked down into the silent street. The
roadway was quite deserted, and the
only pedestrian in sight on tha pave
ment was one of the guardians of the
peace whom she wished to avoid. Stay,
though! Surely! There was a man lean
ing against the pedestal of the nearest
of the gas clusters In front of the Stad
thuus, and he was watching the Von
Lindberg mansion. Even as she, looked
he turned his head a little, and the rays
from one of the lamps. falling full' on
his face she recognized him at orice as
"Herr Winckel," Spencer Fortescue's
chimney! For the first time in, her life
her. knees trembled a- little â not at the
quick suggestion of an infernal machine
but at the sudden importance her* mid
night excursion had really assumed.
The feeling did not: deter her ' from
prompt action. In a moment she was
kneeling before the grate and peering
up the chimney by the light of her can
die at a portmanteau, a size smaller
than those \yhich Delaval had taken
away, jammed .about three -feet up.
Louder ar.d clearer now she could hear
the .tickingâ undoubtedly from the in
terior of the portmanteau..
Ilma's face showed first alarm, then
grateful affection aa she heard of the
American's departure at the Instance
of her friend. But before she could
put the feeling into words a tall
young officer came slashing: round a
corner from a side street, nearly run
ning into them. On seeing lima h<=>
half drew back. then, perceiving that
she was accompanied, he raised his
hand in salute and essayed a smile.
"This Is the brave, true-hearted
gentleman. Laura," said lima, speak
ing In French, and with a hard ring in
her voice. "Let me introduce to you
Captain Boris Dubrowski of the Imper
rial Guard. Boris, this is my dear
friend Miss Metcalf, of whom I think
you .have heard. You have to thank
her for a great service, about which
she was telling me when you came
up."
â¢ "Indeed! I render a thousand
thanks. Miss Metcalf, In advance,"
said Boris courteously, addfng, as he
walked on beside the girls: "Is it per
mitted to inquire in what way I am
indebted to you?"
Once more Laura related what she
had Just told lima, again going no
further than Delaval's use of Du
browski's name. She was glad of the
chance, for, as she told Fortescue af
terward, she was beginning to sus
pect a "nigger in the fence," and she
was curious to know whether the
American had any real title to claim
acquaintance with the Tsar's aide de
camp..
"Delaval? Delaval?'* he repeated,
tapping his forehead. "I never heard
the "namÂ«. and certainly, do not know
the, man. He must have been an im
postor, with some base design. I can
not thank yotv sufficiently. Miss Met
calf, for saving me from consequences
which might have resulted from no
fault of mine."
It was Laura's turn to be puzzled â
at a scornful smile hoveringr round II
ma's classic mouthâ but ahe merely
made light of her dealings . with the
American, and tried to stop the effu
sive thanks which, however. Boris
continued to shower upon her. Sud
denly, as they were passing the post
office, he came to a halt, saying that
he had to call for a letter, but that if
they would excuse him for a minute
he would esteem it the highest of
honors to escort Miss Metcalf home.
Still bent on keeping up appear

"faithful," was the strange reply.
With characteristic promptness
Laura changed the subject, and pres
ently suggested that they should take
a walk in the town. So, lima assent
ing readily, they explored- the prome
nnde on the old city walls, admired
the view from the Victory Belvedere,
and criticized the snops in the
Shweldnitxstrasse together, till lima
regained much of her gracious charm
under the influence of her compan
ion's infectioua vivacity. By the time
they turned homeward lima was so
much like her old self that Laura told
her of Delaval's attempt to uss Du
browiki's name as an introduction,
saying, however, nothing about the.
dlscovery of the infernal machine.
"Spencer thought the Tsar might
chop oft your captain's head if It
leaked out that he was being used a*
a reference, so I gave the Yankee hia

//^THB GRAFTERS." Francis
Â£ Lynde's novel of the strenuous
life in backdoor politics, hums
with actlpn all through, like telegraph
wires in a gale of wind. It Is clang
ing, rattling action of the sort that puts
one's nerves to the tension and makes a
gallop the only admissible speed of lo
comotion through the reading. The des
tinies of railroads, the lives of boom,
towns, the fortunes of oil* wells, of a
6tatÂ» government, and* incidentally of
various interesting individuals, are hur
ried along at a rattling rate In this re
markably interesting story of Lynde's.
The boom and the whirr of train, tele
graph, automobile and ticker, the strain
and the nerve-racking of the characters
swept Into the whirl of the story and
the kaleidoscopic flitting of scene on
scene all make for an atmosphere . of
breathless suspense, which acts very
much like a galvanic shock upon the
flaccid nerves of the inveterate book
worm. Were Mr. Lynde's story better
written in parts it might N be allowed a
place weir up near "The Pit."
The author is far happier in plot con
struction than In the outlining of his
characters. Relying, upon the great
public's Insatiable appetite for all that
lies hidden "on the inside" of politics,
great business deals or the daring
movements of corporations, Lynde has
woven an intricate web in the loom of
modern; activities of which the four re
taining posts are .railroad deals, oil
stocks, boom realtv bubbles and cor
rupt State administration. Gathering
all the threads about the machinations
of a gang of "grafters" dominating the
administrative and judicial functions of
a hypothetical Western commonwealth
and the efforts of an idealized Attorney
Foulkft' to break that ring, the author
has worked out a ' plot scheme which
must commend itself for, Its very Inge
nuity. This, though, with one reserva'
tionâin places the author Jumps | from
one complication to another with a sud
denness and a lack of explanation,
made Imperative by the .Â» untutored
mind of his reader,' which often Induces
no small degree of - confusion In the
mind pt the one who. follows him. .
With all his preliminary succession of

to grace a park, or a' city's boulevard,

With the maple in all its forms and
hues., the oak, the pine, the alder and
willow, the author treats as If he were
pointing out the beauties of some
Greek temple. The tracery of leaf
and silkiness of blossom, rough hardi
ness of trunk and graceful set of
branch all have an appeal to him. To
his text he has added the further tes
timony of the, camera, so that one
cannot lay the book aside without a
compelling sense of the grandeur and

G. W.Dilllnghara <fc Co. of New York
have published two little works of at
tempted humorâ "Twisted History," by
Frank C. Voorhies, and "The Theatri
cal Primer." by H. A. Vivian. Both
fall quite flat. "Twisted History" deals
with our early colonial chronicles after
the manner of Bill Nye's history of the
United States, but the form of the book
alone is Nye's â the humor would not
pass current on a vaudeville stage.
The story is couched, furthermore, in
very poor slang â not a factor to add to
the book's worth. "The Theatrical
Primer" Is a succession of dreary at
tempts at the George Ade thins; in
slang fables. It Is dreary dull.

a SERIES of essays upon books and
J\ book reading by Richard Le Gal
â¢ llenne, which first appeared as
contributions to the monthly. Success,
have now been gathered into well
merited book covers under the title
"How to * Get the Best Out of
Books," and presented In an at
tractive little volume for the bet
ter understanding of all book lovers on
things bookish. Mr. Le Galllenne's
professed design in this book Is not
to overshoot the mark in his attempt
ed setting forth of a guide to good
reading by dipping -too deep Into the
profundities of literature, but to set
the paths for the guidance of the
casual reader and the busy person
whose reading is recreation. For the
man whose tastes or whose opportu
nities have prevented an enjoyment of
the classics, Le Gailienne has no dog
matic-insistence of iteration upon. the
value of such as a sine qua non to a
complete understanding of books, nor
does he attempt' an elaborate analysis
of literary forms which might be con
fusing and profitless to his reader.
"The aim of these simple pages," says
the author, !'has been to convince him
(the business man) that literature Is
a living thing, and that the relation of
books to life Is close and vitalâ and by
no means ornamental."
To this end the critic proceeds to tell
simply and clearly what to look for
In books, what to find in good poetry,
how an unlettered man may profit by
the books and how he must select his
reading that he may be broader and
more cultured. For the man of affairs
who turns to books to find rest and
pleasure, Le Gailienne would recom
mend only "the play grounds of litera
ture" â nothing heavy, nothing that
cannot be read with sympathy and un
derstanding. One must not hurry
through books upon the excuse that
"there is so much to read," for there
Is for each one only so much as he can
assimilate to his betterment, and by
the same measure, the random reader
must not, advises the author, be led
by "literary superstitions" to attempt
to enter into thorough communion with
a classic just because it is denominated
a classic, whether his understanding
follows or not.
In his general comments upon books
that are readable. Le Galllenne takes
occasion to veer somewhat from his
course in order that he may express his
unqualified condemnation of what he
terms "the offal and butchers' meat" of
the present day tendencies in litera
ture. The manifestation he so roundly
anathematizes is none other than what
William Dean Howells champions
writing life as life Is. This movement
of the realists sadly disconcerts Le
Gailienne and he mourns the fact that
the materialism of the nineteenth cen
-tury has stripped the world of all
sweetness and idealism. , But then,
Le Galllenne is a poet and his views
are but natural.

Gives Advice on Books
The House Beautiful continues to be
the standard magazine of reference for
all who have a love for the beautiful

This publication seems to be Just in

Is to lead in the revolt against tha
sham and shoddy of generally ac
cepted Ideals of home furnishings and
to instruct In the truly esthetic such
as is now coming more and more Into
favor. The May number's leading
articles are: "A Remodeled Home In

warehouse business: , ,
Dawson's complete isolation fromth&
world at that time was forcibly . im
pressed upon the author before he had
been there a week. A single newspa
per, containing the news of the battle
of Santiago, drifted into town and its
enterprising owner read it aloud to an
audience who paid $1 a head to gain
admittance to the* hall. When the

big man that much, nearer to. home."
Lynch's comments upon the life at
Dawson are frankly complete. To the
habitues o( % the dance halls, both male
and female, to the gamblers and heavy
drinkers who crowded all Dawson dur
ing the long winter months, he pays
the tribute at least of respectability
and 'restraint Many of the women. be
came the exemplary wives of rich
miners; few of the men allowed the al
lurements of cards and drink to rob
them of all their hard-earned gold.
For the strict preservation of order at
all times Lynch pays high compliment
to the Northwestern Mounted Constab- !
ulary. ' i
One of the most Interesting portion*
of Lynch's book is that devoted to his
account of a winter trip on dog sleighs
through the mines on El Dorado, Hun
ker and Sulphur creeks. His portraits
of Andy Hunker, Nigger Jim. Billy.
Chappell and others of the successful"
gold diggers are capital. Their native
reticence, bred by the solitude in part
and. by* the ever-present suspicion en
gendered by the great game with.for
tune, when^ once broken down, reveals
a rare good nature and open-handed
generosity, as Lynch shows. Cham
pagne. at $20 a bottle and cigars' cost
ing $1 apiece are none too dear when
these men delight to honor a friend
maybe because < they keep an oil can
full of nuggets beneath their bunk.
Even in the midst of a gold, stampede
these men forget their striving when
the dictates of charity ' force them to
render assistance to an unfortunate fel
low miner. "The Arctic pioneers," says
Lynch, "were sometimes selfish, per
haps, as are other men, but always
gallant, generous and chivalrous to a
comrade or stranger in danger or dis
tress."
A portion of Lynch's narrative is de
voted to the recording of his own ' ex
periences as a mine operator, of his
trials and successes. One chapter tells
of the robbery committed by Louis, his
own cook, by which the author was
made $7000 poorer. Another recounts
the details of a murder in the wilder
ness, and the pursuit of the murderers.
All of it is fascinating. Sometimes, it
most be said, Mr. Lynch's diction has
something of the fascinating about It
as well. "The next^day we stopped
two hours for wood-^-and mosquitoes,"
says the author. "The former is cut
by white â¢ men during the winter
months," he adds, leaving the reader
to twist the construction to suit his
own views as to whether the latter
were cut at all, and if so. by whom.

said that the. latter's record of these

"Social Disease and Marriage," by
Prince A. Morrow, surgeon to the City
Hospital of New York, Is an exhaust
ive and scholarly treatise upon an Im
portant branch of therapeutics, which
has also strong bearing upon certain
aspects of soclologlc questions. The
technical character of the work and
the nature of its subject matter does
not permit of lengthy review beyond
the pages of a medical journal. Lea

publishers.
Warman have written along railroad

Wheels," which has to do with the
forcible kldnap'ing of Governor Bucks
and his co-conspirators upon a flying
special, hotly kept to its pace by the
Imminent danger of collision from be
hind, is a Dlece of vivid narrative that
owns a remarkable compelling force.
As hinted already, the author's char
acters are not remarkable for any
great Individuality, possibly because
some of them are involved in a wholly
unnecessary love affair, and such folk
are not seen at their best. If Lynde had
left David Kent to his industrious
"busting up" of the capital ring and
not snared him in cupid's meshes along
with the very colorless, very Puritani
cal Elinor Brentwood, David would not
have come perilously near making a
spectacle of himself In the reader's
eyes. Nor does the remarkable young
Penelope, also a party to this love busi
ness, ring true to the note. When will
our dear readers cease to make the
poor writer folk foist a link or so of
hearts Into their otherwise promising
stories?

An Interesting thing at this time is
the last speech of McKloley, given at
the close of what Curtis has to say. In
that speech a special item for the pres
ent election year is what he has to say
of the tariff. For really the tariff Is
the only vital issue between the two
great parties, except that in a general
way the Democrats claim to be the
champion of the welfare of the masses
as against the privileges of the wealth
intrenched classes, and the Republicans
claim to be the bringerB of practical
prosperity as against mere theories of
what is right. The Issue of free silver
is a dead issue, imperialism is a bug
bear, and as for the negro question,
that no longer divides Republicans and
Democrats.
Other Items of interest in the book
are the telling of how Seward should
rightfully have credit for that famous
"higher law" doctrine; the advice that
civil servants of long experience should
have increased pay; the sole severe
criticism of his party because of Its
failure to build up the merchant ma
rine: the claim that the party .should
have another fifty years of life, and
the summing up of the glories of that
party â what it has done and what it
will do.

Two books upon the practice of med
icine have recently been published. In
a treatise entitled "Self-Cure of Con
sumption." Charles H. Stanley Davis,
M. D.. of the Connecticut State Medi
cal Society undertakes to demonstrate
his theory of how the dread disease
may be conquered without absolute
dependence upon medicinal aids. The
chief reliance, he states, is to be placed
upon the scientific use of air, sunlight.
water, food, rest, exercise, etc. â that
will Improve nutrition and increase the
vital resistance. The object is to in
crease the resistance of the patient, so
as to bring about the arrest of the tu
berculosis process, prevent dreaded
secondary Infection and Induce final
cure. The book is largely devoted to
the open air treatment, and there are
chapters rn diet, exercise, etc., as well
as on the prevention of consumption
and other diseases.
The work Is published by EL B. Treat
& Co., New Tork; Its price. 75 cents.
7BEHI2 art two reasons why
Franc-is Curtis' book, "The Re
jiublican Party," comes out at
an opportune timeâone is that
this is the soml-centennlal of that
â¢ party's life and the other that we
ere so close to a fresh popular deci
sion as to whether that party is to re
main in power, and, if so, by what
large majority the victory is to be at
'talned. To those stanch Republicans
who have fully made up their minds
to vote the party ticket the book will
be of value Just as a luxury because'
it is. a recounting by an enthusiastic
lover of that party of a history of the
policy and achievements and glory of
Its half -century of life, and it will be of
much practical use to those who wish
to decide deliberately and wisely on
which sidp of the Bcale they will count
when the two great parties are again
'Â¦weighed in the balance of public opin
ion. Especially will It be of assist
'ftnee to that multitude of young men
.who will cast their first vote this fall
and who should carefully study both
parties before resolving how they will
' begin to make history both in their
personal lix-es and in the life of the
nation by the casting of their first bal
lots.
The book is a compilation of mat
ter from many sources â newspaper
files, books, histories, encyclopedias,
. letters, with enough of Curtis' own
thought thrown in to weave the ex
tracts well Into a comprehensive and
swiftly comprehendlble whole. It
covers the whole period of the life of
tbe party from its birth in 1854 and is
written so close to date as to give a
good account of the recent isthmian
canal coup. All this is condensed into
â¢two volumes, the connecting links be
tween the cullings from many sources
Â¦are well wrought by Mr. Curtis and his
comments are interesting. There are
â¢many sidelights thrown on facts,
which will make them interesting.
, -.afrwh to even those who are most fa
miliar with the history of the party.
.The work is avowedly partisan and
probably is therefore under far less
obligation to be impartial than would
lÂ»e a book of history of the whole
; country and of all parties.
While there is no unseemly vituper
ation and no over-rude hurling of
blame, yet, to some extent in the text,
ar.d.more between the lines, there can
' be seen a strong dislike of the South
and of the Democratic party. It is
'. perhaps right that there should be euch
books even in this day of balming an-
. "â¢ cjent rounds and building up harmony.
' The only reason for mentioning that
.privilege at its pages is that the dlli
â¢gent seeker the golden mean of
.all things may know that he should
-'read both this book and some other in
'prder to get mountainrtop views of
- things as wholes. The book should be
â¢' interesting to the confirmed Democrat
" by giving him a broader view of the
.history ol his country in the very at
tempt to eee that history as it is view
Â¦ ed by his so long successful oppon
ents. It is worth reading as a history
'of our country aside from Its value
as a party history In that It gives a
special . view of It as It has been so
largely made by the ascendancy, prac
tically complete for half a century, of
the Republicans. They have the pres
tige of long success, have had the op
portunity to make their Ideals Into
deeds, and have initiated certain poli
cies and fully started our country in
certain lines of progress which could
cot be wholly diverged from now even
by a great Democratic victory.
-. - An Interesting Item in the book is the
aocount of the birth of the party. The
.'first chapter starts out with the telling
of what 4s nominally known and per
haps generally accepted as the birth,
namely, when the mass meeting at
Jackson, Michigan, on the 6th of July,
ltM, so resolutely resolved: "We will
co-operate, and be known as the Re
' publican party until the contest be
. ended." A resolve that reads specially
well after we know how heroically It
was made good. But further along In.
the book is another account of the
birth of the party, and this other not
only seems to have the best founda
- tlon for Its claim, but It is a story
which appeals more strikingly to the
natural human love of a tale of human
â¢ glorious achievement. This account
gives credit for the Immediate calling
into powerful life of the Republican
party to one Alvan E. Bovay of RIpon,
Wisconsin, to whose energetic thought
and strong acting out of his thought
the North first responded by that unit
ed action which was needed to make
! scattered desire effective. It's a Huxley
. axiom that all things must have their
humble beginnings, and Bovay began
that mighty Republican party by unit
ing his fellow townsmenâ Whigs, Dem
" ocrats and Free Soilersâ as a nucleus
against the slave power. He suggest
. ed the name Republican to Horace
..Greeley. and Greeley made It a go by
giving it a good send off In the Tribune
â¢ of June 21. 1S54.
Of course the country has to be In the
mood to reepond to this movement of
Bovay, else he could not have done
it; but, nevertheless, it was a lesson

gravely, from his perch on a window

One day Jose whispered again:

The day became weeks, still Jose's
prophecy did not come true. The cap

the' vehemence of a madman.
On day the presfdente, or "chief of

them a visit. He inspected the cell
with pompous complacency. Finally

a window sill and quietly
arranging his wing feathers.

Andrew's future was now obscured
by a large and lowering cloud. He
had'ltrled ; everything in sight but
journalism, and that was ' out of the
question, because . ; he objected ;. to
working for a living. What he want
ed : was a place where \ he could % rest
between meals and ' make out , bills af
ter supper till he got " sleepy. At this
point -some alleged friend told him
that the ministry was just; the place
for him and. pointed out the tremen
dous salaries that; ministers V receive
for j preaching: once , a week and drink
ing tea and reading poetry: to the la
dles of the church between times. In
sheer desperation? Andrew butted In.
By. dint. of unusual exertion'he man

There 'may be elements of-trutluin
the picture of the noble art of â¢healing
that Andrew drew' i Â« his â¢ mind, but he
didn't fill- it in enough. > The first day
out of ] the medical college,' where he
had learned the names of most of the,
component parts of the human frame
divine and could take the said frame
to pieces â¢ and put it together again
without leaving out more than half >of
the ': works, â¢ he . ran up against a case
that put him out court without a
chance for a rehearing. A portly dame
wlth'an , enlarged appetite called him In
to straighten out the kinks in her head
after r a. simple .little supper, with fre
quent vinous appendages. % The embry
onic doctor^ being, new, to the business,
advised bromo seltzer and cracked Ice.
The dame' had called him because she
had. thought that, she could -count' on 'a
beginner being diplomatic." Old doctors
sometimes gfelj the . truth " in | moments
of, desperation,' and,- just.to see^ if {they
have l forgotten , the formula,' Andrew's
practlce*"departed on' a ! protracted" Jour
ney up the flume at that particular mo
ment. % Then '; arid ; there !, he \ learned \ the
sad; truth that the principal business of
a doctor is, to tell people they have one
.thing v and : treat them .for; something
be able to lay out a 'contract in such a
manner' that no :; one "can tell what Mt'
means and ' afterward : ; to " demonstrate
that ' It means '^something' entirely dif-'
ferent from what every one supposed.
The only thing that 'Andrew .was right
on was the supposition that a lawyer's
principal occupation Is c'hargrtrig, but In
*hls active practice" he : never seemed to
be able to get that far.
In despair of .ever illuminating the
legal profession perceptibly, .Andrew
decided that he was cut out' for. the
practice of medicine. ' That bore all the
earmarks of an easy graft and that was
what he was 7 looking 1 for. All * that ' a
disciple : of Esculapius - had \ to . do, ac
cording to Andrew's preconception, was
to fit out a reception room with half
.a . dozen - chairs, which would give the
patients lumbkffo j at . the very,; least If
they ever tried to. sit in, them, , and: a
; bunch of Â¦ magazines three months Â¦ old.
His part -was tomtit in Â» the ; cubby, hole
at the back and /ask people j what f they
liked; to eat r. ; Then he would tell them
to give it up and take a of: the
I powder . after J each . v meal. . .The \ powder
' t , was I to | keep | them? ; from C finding /out j
.that there wasn't anything, the matter
*| IS name was Andrew, but he
I | didn't seem to be able to con
1 I nect for all that. Names are all
*/ very well In their way, but
sometimes they are too much in the
way. That was the case with Andrew.
His middle name began with a C, but
that is a subject into which it is not
necessary to enter. There's no use in
rubbing it in. The whole sum and sub
stance of the matter was that he was
constantly being reported among the
also rans, if he was fortunate enough
to get away from the post at alL He
was designed origioally for the busy
-world of business, but some one had
blundered, in the original designs and
the result was that Andrew had about
as much business ability as a four
months-old baby in the Congo Free
State.
His idea of the way modern business
was conducted was that the captain of
industry sat at a. rolltop desk. In the
shadow of a pure Havana and sent out
orders to buy steel and sell stock, oc
casionally reversing the process as oc
casion or the nearness of the Presi-,
dential election demanded. This theory
contains a germ of truth to the extent
that there are a few men whose par
ticipation In the manufacture of steel
end other necessaries of life is com
prised In one or the other of these two
activities. What Andrew fell down on
was the fact that the way to the rolltop
desk and the clear Havana lies over
the top of the scrap heap. That was
where Andrew stopped and where' he
was usually found the morning after.
Then he decided to have a try at the
law. It seemed easy, but he was des
tined to discover that it was the clients
and not the profession that are easy.
A lawyer is about the hardest proposi
tion that a poor man ever stacked, up
against. Andrew's idea was that : the
only equipment necessary for the noble
pursuit of Blackstone was an imposing
array of digests and reports bound" in
half calf and a habit of standing with
one foot on the lower rung of the chair
and looking at the ceiling whenever. he
was talking to any one. At least that
seemed to him to be about all that the
majority of lawyers do business with.'
When he butted into the Inner ring
he found that he had been basely de
ceived. While it is true that a lawyer
doesn't need to know an injurious
amount of law he needs to be aware
of a lot of things that are incidental to
! the law Itself. For Instance, he, needs
to know jest how near the edge a man
can go without being pushed over. For
the performance of this , feat .it ' is nec
essary to know. not so much, what; the
law Is as what it is not. Also, he must
jumped at the conclusion that the lit
erary . life was the life for him. That
was five years ago. At the present mo
ment he is sitting In his study smok
ing a thick-waisted Havana and wait
ing for the footman and the butler to
bring In the morning's installment of
checks in a clothes basket. Later in
the day he will dictate a couple of
chapters of his new book on~ "How to
Get the Most Out of Life; or Publish
ers Made Easy." He already has four
novels in the half-million class 'and is
Interviewed at least once a week, be
sides contributing a column of Help
ful Talks With Toungr Men to the
Weekly Step-Ladder. His first novel
was an illuminating exposition of the
character - and career of a successful
merchant prince. He followed this up
with a legal novel, a romance of med
icine and a story of the pulpit that put
the late "Robert Elsmere" clear out of
the r*nning. .
It isn't fair to Andrew to jive away
the formula, but we cannot refrain
from offering -a bit of worldly advice
to the young man of the country In a
few and mercifully brief words. If at
first you don't succeed get out of the
business and buy a typewriter. Then
you can write a book and tell all about
it. The people who have succeeded will
fall over themshelves to buy the book.

Having made the seminary without
serious damage to, himself, he began
to look for. one of those warm-heart
ed city charges that his .friend had

The second lieutenant coaxed Duck
In with a banana. The old bird re
garded him suspiciously at first, but
the fruit was a tempting bite. He side
stepped along the limb to the lieu

the major closed his blind. Duck
found the banana good and was
pleased.

The major was composing himself for
an afternoon nap. His haggard face
showed that he had not had too many
naps of late. It is no small thing to re
port sixteen men lost when there is offi
cially no war.. He had scoured the
country much of .late â he was tired.
His- eyes closed â¢ drowsilyâ a familiar
sound caused him to open them' dream
ily. .
"There's â th'at â cussed â parrot â
again!"
Suddenly he sprang to his feet.
"My God!" he gasped, "what was

. He listened. Outside his window he
heard it again. ; . -
. "Hawâ hawâ hawâ haw! Liven up,
there;- ye bald-headed' galoot! Haw
hawâhaw!"
The major dashed to his' window and
tore aside the; shell blind. On the lower
limb of the mango tree sat. Duck.
It is not to be wondered at that the
captain and the two lieutenants and
the surgeon thought the major mad.
His manner of calling them to his room
gave them â¢ ample grounds for such a
belief. Then they saw Duck and un
derstood. t . ' .
It was soon , noised about that Duck
had come back, and the entire garri
son crowded about, under, the major's
window. Duck, apparently bewildered
at the excitement, cocked his head in
characteristic manner. Then he plant
ed, both feet on the limb, lowered his
head and raised his outspread tail.
"Hello, boys!" he shouted.
A few answered, but the majority
held an awed silence.
"Hawâ hawâ haw 1" chuckled Duck,
ruffling his feathers; then, in an angry
tone:"
"Shut up,- Hill: "yer locoâ yer loco â

into a bamboo thicket. Duffy and
two others sprang, up; next instant
they were rolling on the floor with
Hill.
"Lemrae go â lemme get at him!"
yelled the corporal. "I'll kill the

But Duffy was not yet tired of life.

fell ' squirming and shrieking in the

IT was not with official approval
that Duck became part of E Com
pany, but then Duck was quite an
Independent sort of chap. That
was the keynote to his characterâ he
did and said just about what he
pleased. If the major, who was post
commander in San Ildefonso. object
ed ' to Duck's soliloquies outside his
window during the midday siesta,
that made no difference to Duck.
Duck, perched just outside on the
lower limbs of the big mango tree,
would twist his yellow head to one
side, hold a moment's silence, ruffle
up his feathers and then let loose that
wild, diabolical laugh of his, which
had given him his name. Then the
major would get mad and lose his
dignity and throw things at Duck and
Duck would flutter up a few more
limbs, out of reach of the major's mis
siles, and say things to the major for
which there are heavy penalties in the
army regulations. But you can't
court-martial a big, ugly green par
rot with a partly yellow and partly
bald head.
Duck hailed originally from some
southern island, but he could swear in
the local Tagalog dialect with all the
fluency of a native. He was equally
proficient in Spanish and English, ex
cept that he slightly lisped his Eng
lish. He had got that habit from the
young recruit who bought him from
a Chinaman In Manila and brought
him up to the isolated outpost where
Company E was stationed. The re
cruit drank vino and died of horrors
and as he hadn't made a will Duck
became his own master.
Hitherto he had been kept confined
by a small, thin chain attached by one
end to his foot and by the other to a
bar. After the death of Duck's master
the major ordered the bird's release,
hoping he might take to the Jungle.
J3ut Duck had learned white man's
ways. He stuck to the boys, roosting at
night on a bamboo pole in the barrack
mess room. The boys supplied him
Â¦with bits of desirable food, and he, in
return, regaled them with choice com
ments on current events of garrison
life. As a conversationist, although
Â¦somewhat profane at times, Duck's
equal would have been hard to find.
- "Tell ye what," remarked Corporal
Hill, as the men were lounging about
on their cots one hot afternoon, "this
yere Duck's a pretty smart bird.
Durned if he can't pick up Tagalog and
Spanish quicker'n you humans, i There
was Jose, as used to be usin' words to
us we didn't understand and never
could remember long enough to ask
somebody what knowed what they
meant. What does Duck do but memo
rize them. Yesterday the priest comes
in an* Duck gets off Jose's little pet
phrase. The priest looks at me, and
tays, 'Who learned him that?' 'Jose, I
reckon,' says I. Wall, he called up
Jose and gave him such a rakin' over
as he won't forget soon. What ye
think? The little beast had been callin*
.us something so bad that ye can't find
words in English mean enough to ex
press it. Tell ye what, Duck's all
right."
"You bet he's all right," agreed a
big Dakotan. "You won't let no cuss
ed goo-goo do us dirt, will you,.
Duck?" He looked languidly up " at
fthe big green bird perched on his fa
vorite pole and conscientiously gnaw
ing the last shred of meat from a
chicken's leg bone. He held it in one
gnarled foot as a man would a club.
The Dakotan's words seemed to at
tract his attention. He suspended
, operations on the bone and turned
his yellow head to one* side.
"That's right," responded the Da
, kotan, admiringly. "Ye see, he's
got sabe. Yer all right. Duck."
"You bet," persisted Duck, in a
. louder tone. '
; "Yes, that's what I say," agreed
the soldier. "Yer bet yer life. Yer
, all right!"
"You bet," said the parrot.
It was some days after that a ser
, geant and fifteen men were detailed to
convoy four carreton loads of com
missary supplies to the next post, San
Qulntin^ twenty miles still farther
Into the heart of the mountains. The
four ox-carts, with their four, carabao
drivers, stood waiting the order to
start. The men were lined up and
. the sergeant stood at attention while
the first lieutenant gave him his or
. ders. .
"You must try to make it before
dark, sergeant, and don't let any of
- your men wander off into the brush.
[ Keep them air together."
The sergeant saluted.
. By the lieutenant's side stood a small,
! sallow-face,d native, in white duck. *A:
black band about his broad-brimmed
that bore the insription, "Jefe de Po
\ licia," which meant that he bossed the,
"' local native constabulary by consent of
' the powers in office.
"You feel certain Tino isn't about, do
â¢ you, Ramirez?" the lieutenant asked.
â¢ . "Most certain-lee," assured the chief
5 of police, complacently. "He is now in
: Cagayan."
: "What?" broke out a harsh, deep
. voice.
The native started. The line of.sol
1 diers chuckled. .
"Damn that parrot," exclaimed the
i lieutenant, swinging around .to the
i carts. Duck was perched comfortably
] on one of the loads. .
"I hope you lose that beast on the
way," said the officer, testily^
' " Haw â haw â haw -*- haw: " came
t Duck's notorious laugh. Then, with an
5 angry ruffle of feathers, he cocked his
head.
j "Ye lie!" he shouted. Â» '
"Go ahead, sergeant," ordered- ' the
- lieutenant, ignoring the parrot's insult
> ing remarks. The carts creaked and
r rolled out on the road, the men formed

'to Jump, but "he .swayed uncertainly.
'Once, , an instant after, that.* he was

again.
The flames wrapped the building in
a yellow fury; by daylight the big
barracks were a smoldering pils of
ruins. So little water was thrown that
It was nearly nightfall before we could
get into the wreck. The tragedy had
blotted out the feud between the
strikers and the new men. Side by
side they worked, as side by side Si
clone and Fitzpatrick had stood in the
morning, striving to uncover the mys
tery of the missing man. Next day
twice as many men were In the ruins.
Fitzpatrick, while we were search
ing, called continually for Slclon*
Clark. We didn't tell him the truth;
indeed, we didn't know It; nor do we
know it yet. Every brace, every beam.
every brick was taken from the charred
pile, every foot of . cinders, every
handful of ashes sifted, but of a bu
. man being' the searchers found never a
trace. Not a bone, not a key, not a
knife, not a button which could bo
identified as his. Like the smoke which
swallowed him up, he had disappeared
completely and forever.
Is he alive? I cannot telL
But this I know:
Years afterward Sidney Blair, head
of our engineering department, -was
running a line, looking then, as . we
are looking yet, for a coast outlet.
He took only a flying camp with
him. traveling in the lightest kind of
order, camping often with the cattle
men he ran across.
- One night, away down in the pan
handle, they fell in with an outfit
driving a bunch of steers up the Yel
low Grass trail. Blair noted that the
foreman was a character, a man of
few words, but of great muscular
strength, and, moreover, frightfully
scarred.
He was silent and inclined to be
morose at first, but after: he learned
Blair was from McCloud he unbent a
bit, and after a time began asking
questions which indicated a surpris
ing familiarity with, the northern
country and with our road. In par
ticular this man asked what had be
come of Bucks, and. when told what
a big railroad man he had grown, as
serted with a sudden bitterness and
without in any way leading up to It
that with Bucks on the West End
there never would have been a strike.
Sitting at their campflre while their
crews mingled, Blair noticed in the
flicker of the blaze how seamed ' the
throat and breast of the cattleman
were; even his sinewy forearms were
drawn out of shape. -He asked, too,
whether Blair recollected the night
the barracks burned, but Blair, at that
time, was east of the river and so ex
plained though hÂ» related to the cow
boy Incidents of the fire which he had
heard, among others the story of Pltt
patrick and Siclone Clark.
"And Fitzpatrick la alive and 81
done is dead,** said Blair, In conclu
sion. But the cowboy disputed him.
"You mean Clark is alive and Fitz
patrick Is dead," said he.
"No," contended Sidney, "Fitzpatrick
Is running an engine up there now.
I saw him within three months." But
the cowboy was loth to conviction.
Next morning their trails forked.'
The foreman seemed disinclined tÂ»
part from the surveyors and while the
bunch was starting; he rode a long: way
with Blair, talking in a random Viy.
Then, suddenly wheeling, he waved a
good-by with his heavy Stetson and,
galloping hard, was soon lost to the
north In the ruts of the Yellow Grass.
Once again, that only two years ago,
something came back to us.
Holmes Kay. one of our staff of
surgeons, the man, in fact, who took
care of Fitzpatrick. enlisted in Illinois
and went with the First to Cuba. They
got in front of Santiago Just after the
hard fighting of July 1 and Holmes
was detailed for hospital work among
Roosevelt's men.
One of the wounded, a sergeant, had
sustained a gunshot wound in the jaw
and in the confusion had received
scant attention, Kay took hold of him.
He was a cowboy, like most' of the
rough riders, and after his Jaw was
dressed Kay made some remark about
the hot fire they had been through be
fore the blockhouse.
"Where are you t from?" asked
Holmes.
"Everywhere."
"Where did you get burned that
way?"
"Out on the plains."
"How?"
But the poor fellow went off into a
delirium and to the surgeon's amaze
ment began repeating train orders. Kay
was paralyzed at the way he talked
our lingoâ and a cowboy.
Neighbor, when" he heard the story,
was only confirmed in his belief that
the- roughrider was Siclone Clark. I
give you the tales as they came tone,
and for what you may make of them.
I'myself believe that if Siclone Clark
Is still alive he will one day yet come
back to where he was best known and.
In spite of his faults, best liked. They
talk-^of him out there as they do of
old man , Sankey.
I say I believe, if tie lives he will one
day come .back. The day he does wiil
be a great day in McCloud. On that
day Fitxpatrlck will have to take, down
the little tablet which he placed in the
brick facade of the hotel which now
stands on the site of the old barracks.
For, as that tablet now stands, it. la
gacred to the memory of Siclone Clark.
CCCT>HERE goes a fellow that
I walks Eke Siclone Clark." ex
â¢ . Â¦ I claimed Duck Middleton. Duck
.1 was sitting in the trainmaster's
offloe with a group of engineers. He
â¢ wu one of the blacklisted strikers and
run* an engine now down on the Santa
F"eÂ» But at long intervals Duck gets
. back to revisit the scenes of his early
triumph*, The men who surrounded
him were once at deadly odds with
Duck and his chums, though now the
ancient enmities seem forgotten, and
Duck â the once ferocious Duck â sits
â¢" occasionally among the new men and
ffosstps about early days on the West
JBxxCL
"Do you remember Siclone, Reed?"
asked Duck, calling to me in the pri
. vatÂ© office.
"Remember him?" I echoed. "Did
Â¦anybody who ever knew Siclone forget
him?"
Siclone Clark was one of the two cow
>oyÂ» who helped Harvey Reynolds and
. Ed Banks save 69 at Griffin the night
. the coal train ran down from Ogalalia.
" They were both taken into the service;
Eiclone, after a while, went to wiping.
When Bucks asked his name Siclone
answered, "S. Clark-" '
"What's your full name?" asked
-Bucks.
"S. Clark."
"But what does S. stand for?" per- .
sisted Bucks.
"Stands for Siclone. I reckon, don't
it?" retorted the cowboy, with some
â¢ annoyance.
It was not usual in those days on the
â¢plains to press a jnan too closely about
his name. There might be reasons why
.it would not be esteemed courteous.
"I reckon it do." replied Bucks, drop
ping into Siclone's grammar; and with
out a quiver he registered the new man
as Siclone Clark; and his checks always
road that way. The name seemed to
fit. he adopted it without any objection,
[ and after everybody came to know him
it fitted so well that Bucks was be
lieved to have second sight when he
named the hare-brained fireman. He
could get up a Btorm quicker than any
man cm the division, and if he felt so
disposed stop one quicker.
â¢ In Eplte of his eccentricities, which
were many, and his headstrong way of
doing some things, Siclone Clark was a
good engineer and deserved a better
fate than the one that befell him.
Thoughâ who can tell?â it may have
â¢ been Just to his liking.
The strike was the worst thing that
ever happened to Siclone. He was one
'of those big-hearted, violent fellows,
who went into it loaded with enthu
siasm. He had nothing to gain by it â
"'at- least nothing to speak of. But the
idea that somebody on the East End
needed their helr> led men like Siclone
in; and they thdupht it a cinch that
, the company would have to take them
all back.
The consequence was that when we
staggered along without them, men
like Siclone, easily aroused, naturally
of violent passions and with no self
restraint, stopped at nothing to cripple
the service. And they looked on the
men who took their places as entitled
neither to liberty nor life.
When our new men began coming
from the Reading to replace the strik
er* every one wondered who would get
Siclone Clark's engine, the 313. Siclone
had gently sworn to kill the first man
who took out the 313 â and bar nobody.
Whatever others thought of Siclone's
vaporings, they counted for a good deal
on the West End; nobody wanted
trouble with him.
. Even Neighbor, who feared no man,
sort of let the CIS lay in her stall as
long as pctsible after the trouble be
gan.
Nothing: was said about it. Threats
cannot be taken cognizance of offleial
ly. We were bombarded with threats
all the time; they had long since ceased
to move us. Yet Siclone's engine stayed
in the roundhouse.
Then, after Foley and. McTerza and
Sinclair, came Fitzpatrick from the
East. McTerza was put on the mails,
and coming down one day on the White
Flyer he bleiv a cylinder head out of,
the 416.
Fitzpatrick was waiting to take her.
â¢out when she came stumping in on one
pair of driversâ for we were using en
gines worse than horseflesh then. But,
of course, the 416 was put out. The
only gig left in the house was the 313.
I imagine Neighbor felt the finger of
fate" in it. The mail had to go. The
time had come for the 313; he ordered
her- fired.
"The man that ran this engine swore
he would kill the man that took her
cut." said Neighbor, sort of incident
ally, as Fitz stood by waiting for her
to steam.
"I suppose that means me," said
Fitzpatrick.
"I suppose it does."
"Whose engine is it?"
"Sicione Clark's." ; .
Fitzpa trick shifted to the other leg.
"Did he say what I would be doing
while this was going on?"
, .Something in Fitzpatrick's manner
made Neighbor laugh. Other things
crowded in and no more was said.
No more was thought, in fact. The
313 rolled as kindly for. Fitzpatrick
as for Siclone, and the new engineer,
a Quiet, fellow like Foley, only a good
hit .heavier, went. on and off her with
never a word to anybody.
One day Fitzpatrick dropped into a
barber chop to get shaved. In the
next chair lay Siclone Clark. Siclone
got through first, and, stepping over
to the table to get his bat, picked up
Fitzpatrick may have wiped a lit
tle sweat from., his face, but he said
nothing â only walked flown to the
roundhouse and took out the 313 as
usual for his run.
A week passed before the. two men
met again. One night Siclone, with
a crew of the strikers, ran into half a
dozen of the new men, . Fitzpatrick
among them. and there was
a riot. It was, Siclone's time
to carry out his intention, for Fitz
patrick would have scorned to try to
get_ away. No tree ever breasted a
tornado more sturdily than the Irish
engineer withstood Siclone; but when
Ed Banks got there with his wreck
ing crew and straightened things out
Fitzpatrick was picked up for dead.
That night Siclone disappeared. '
Warrants were gotten . out and
searchers put after him. It was gen
erally understood that the sudden dis
appearance was " one . of Siclone's
freaks. If the ex-cowboy had so de
termined he would not have hidden
to' keep out of anybody's way. I have
sometimes pondered whether shame
hadn't something to do with it His
tremendous physical strength was, fit
for so much better things than beat
ing other men that maybe he 8ort of
realized it af tor the storm had passed.
Â¦ Down east of the depot ground at
McClouds stands, or stood, a great
barnlike hotel, built in boom days,
and long a favorite resting place for
invalids and travelers en route to Cal
'Ifornia by easy stages. It was nick
named the barracks. Many railroad
men 1 boarded there and the new en
gineers liked it because it was close
to the roundhouse and away from the
strikers.
Fitzpatrick.without a whine or a com
plaint, was put to bed in the barracks,
and Holmes Kay, one of our staff sur
geons, was given charge of the case;
a trained nurse was provided besides.
Nobody thought the injured man.would
live. But after" everv care was given
him we turned our attention to the
troublesome task of operating the road.
The 313, whether it happened so or
whether Neighbor thought it well to
drop the disputed machine temporarily,
was not taken out again for three
weeks. â¢ She. was looked on as a hoo
doo and nobody wanted her. Foley re
fused point-blank one day to take her,
claiming that he ha'd troubles of his
own. Then, one 'day, something hap
pened to McTer2a's 'engine; we were
strained for *a locomotive, and the 313
was brought out for McTerza; he
didn't like it a bit. â¢ â¢
Meantime nothing had been seen or
heard of Siclone That, in fact, was
the reason Neighbor urged for.uslng
his engine; but it seemed as if every
thne the '313 went' out it brought out,
Siclone. not to speak of worse things.
That morning about 3 o'clock the un
lucky engine was coupled ,on to the
White. Flyer. The night boy at the
barracks always got up a hot lunch
for the incoming and outgoing crews
on the mail run, and* that . morning
when he was through, he forgot. to
turn off the lamp under his coffee tank.
It overheated the counter. and,in a few
minutes the woodwork was ablaze. If
the frightened boy had emptied the
coffee on the counter he could have put
the fire out, but instead, he ran out to
give the alarm and started upstairs
to arouse the guests.

Just as Fitz got out of his chair.
SIclone came back, replaced the hat on
the table, took up his own hat, and,
as Fit* reached for his, looked at him.
Every one in the shop caught their
breath.
"Is your name Fitzpatrick?"
"Yes. sir."
"Mine is Clark."
Fitzpatrick put on his hat.
"You're running the 3 IS, I believe?"
continued Siclone.
"Yes, sir."
"That's my engine."
"I thought it belonged to the com
pany."
."May be it. does; but I've agreed to
kill the man that takes her out before
this, trouble is settled,' 1 said Siclone
amiably. . : ; â¢*. ' 'â¢ \
Fitzpatrick , met him j steadily, "if
you'll let me know when, it takes
place I'll try and.be there."
"I'don't Jump on any man .without
fair warning,, any ...of th'e boys will tell
you that." continued Siclone. "May
be you didn't know my "word was
out?'-'
Fitzpatrick hesitated. '.'I'm not
looking for trouble with any' man," he
replied, guardedly. "But since you're
disposed to be fair about notice, it's
only fair to you to say that I did
know your word was out."
"Still you took her?"
"It was my orders."
"My word is out; the boys know it
is good. I don't Jump any man with
out fair warning. I know you now,
Fitzpatrick, and the next time I see
you, look out," and without more ado
Siclone walked out of the shop,
greatly to the relief of the barber, if

most of the gowns of the season.
"Perhaps among all the material of

in the list of popular fabrics. It is
durable, thin, cool and easily draped.
It is, when suitably lined, warm
enough for cool weather, and It is still
of such a nature that it can be worn
on the hottest days. No other material
except the old-fashioned nun's veiling

â¢ A gown which caught the eye , was
made of sand colored voile. The ma
terial was very wide and the skirt was
as full as fashion will allow, which is
very full indeed. It was one of those
skirts cut with breadths the same
width all the way down the skirt. The
fullness at the top \vas: caught^ down
by stitched tucks. It was, no gown for
a stout person, but it was lovely for
the thin sisterhood. The waist, was
trimmed with bands of , insertion'un
derlaid with silk of a 5 shade deeper
than sand color.
For summer gowns the plaitings of
the season are hardly practicable, but
they can 'be made so by stitching the
plaits so that they are held fast in "the
laundry. â¢
One of the loveliest of tubable
dresses is made of washable batiste,
with the waist and skirt laid in side
plaits. The plaits are stitched in the
waist to make them hold their own,
like tucks, and they are also stitched
fast In the upper part of the skirt. Of
course they must flare at the lower
part of the skirt.

seams, have captured the town, but

to those who are rather slender across
the hips, but the fat woman must be

Still, with all of these points against
her, the fat woman has certain things

Stocks are the redeeming feature, for
they are not worn very tall and they
can be fitted to any throat.
Sleeves are Immense and most of

which may be slashed or may be clos

a soft lingerie cuff.
The latest fashion note says that
there shall be a very long lace shoulder

a queer look, as though she were all

that--

Here are a few of the characteristics
of the very latest modes, and the
woman who is twenty pounds heavier
thin she should be for her height can
ponder them long and tearfully:
Skirts are very round and very full,
and the majority of them clear the
street.
Hips are tucked, shirred, plaited and
xauch trimmed.
Waists continue to blouse, and the
newest ones have a blouse in the back
as well as in the front. Actually there
are taffeta waists that fall over the
belt In the back at least three inches,
while they bag very decidedly in the
front also. This can be very smart or
decidedly the reverse.

able appointments of tne season's
wardrobe.' It is made of very sheer
lawn, of India linen, of net and of lace.
And there are wonderful tuckers of
silk trimmed with lace and embroidered
quaintly.
The particular use of the tucker Is
for wear with the decollete gown, but
the fancy for cutting the bodices round
has brought them into day use. They
are worn in the necks of dresses that
are made without the stock and they
are also used with little double breast
ed silk Etons which button up so high
that nothing but the throat is visible.
Six handsome net,' lace and lingerie
tuckers formed part of the summer
wardrobe of a very dressy woman. And
that they will see good service cannot
be Questioned. They are made deep
enough for wear with a low cut neg
ligee and they are fine enough to be
seen of an evening when the occasion
requires a high neck Instead of a low
neck. The making of tnis little article
of dress will afford employment for
Industrious . fingers on off days when
there is no more serious dressmaking
on hand. .
A New York woman wears a tucker
of fine net with strips of lace Insertion
through which are run numerous nar
row satin ribbons, each of which is tied
in a little bow in the middle of the
front. A mother-of-pearl button, sur
rounded by a rosette of lace, finishes
the bow, which looks like a little work
of art, as, indeed, it is.
Stocks are made of lace and run with
ribbons for wear with thin summer
gowns, and very pretty they look. They
are about two inches wide, and they
are run with ribbons of narrowest
width. Of course, there is a little hard
work in between the rows of ribbon in
the shape of a cross stitching or a
fagoting^
Another lace stock is made of the
new satin, which, is "very supple, but
the lace is so overlaid and Inset that it
looks as though the whole stock were
lace. Small knots of satin ribbon are
set around the neck, and, in each knot
there is a small button * of . turquoise
and pearl.
Dame Fasion's Gloves.
- Dame Fashion Is' waiting to see how
her gloves will be received. She has
boldly come "out with the one button
length and is .waiting to behold the
effect of her departure upon the fash
ionable women of the land. Short
wristed gloves with one button clasp
ing thÂ« wrist come in all the street
shades and . are considered terribly
English and very smart. '
Dame Fashion's other extreme is
The dyeing of straw hats to match the
gown is one of the pretty conceits. Such
pretty effects in dress can be obtained
if only the hat straw matches the dress.
An opportunity for variety in colors
is found elsewhere on the costume. It
is now customary before purchasing a
gown to take a bit of the silk or the
wool and match it in straw. Or. If one
prefers to work the other way, 'one can
buy a hat and match it in dress goods.
Voile, which is one of the bright par
ticular favorites in dress, can be ob
tained in all colors, and the hat can
match the gown without the additional
expense or ordering it dyed, for they
do dye the straws now to match any
color in dress. x Â£j|
. A hat of golden brown straw, to
match a golden brown gown, can be
exquisitely trimmed with no very great
exhibition of artistic taste.
"You can make any hat match any
gown." said a milliner, "if you will do
two things. The first is to buy & straw
the color of your dress material. ThÂ»
second is to purchase a lace curtain
for the hat. These two articles will
make the entire hat,
"Let the straw match the dress ma
terial exactly. Let it be of a becoming
shape with brim rolling on the sides.
The Curzon shape, with one side rolling
higher than the other, is very pretty.
Now take the hat curtain and* shirr it.
Set it around the crown with the lace
falling off the sides and the back of
the hat. That will trim it sufficiently.
"If you have one of the flat brims
you can take the curtain and shirr it.
and set it around the brim, instead of
around thÂ« crown^ This will fan
around the hat prettily. The front can
then be lifted and fastened with & fancy
pin. This is the way to use a lace
hat curtain when there is no other
trimming or when an old hat Is being
transformed into a new one.
"And another pointer, save your old
buttons. They .are^ being used upon
bat curtains Â»nderfully well. The
point upon which place them is at
each side of the hat in such a manner
as to lift the curtain off the face. The
showiest of buttons can be used."
The milliner might have added that
there is a deal of showiness all through
the scheme in dressâ for such is the
case! . imomfi
"How am : I trimming my gloves?"
asked she with a smile. "Why, I am
following the latest ideas for trimming
the wrists. Upon one pair of gloves I
have set a silver monogram. It Is done
in very slender silver thread, and it is
clasped upon the back of the wrist.
"Another pair of gloves has* nay mon
ogram embroidered in the back in fancy
colors, and there are tiny seed pearls
set in the letters. And still another is
dotted, as to the wrists, with small vel
vet tufts, which make a very handsome
wrist trimming. These gloves I call
my Eugenie gloves. They are allimade
to order, just as Eugenie hadher gloves
made, and are hand embroidered by
the glove-makers. These gloves are for
very nice wear, and they make a pretty
bit of variety in the costume." Â«
The monogram fad might be men
tioned in passing, for it has taken great
hold on everything, and Is seen on
stockings, gloves, veils and ribbons,
not to mention Jewelry and mono

SUITABLE COSTUMES FOR

railroa'd journey is in contemplation a
sensible costume should be prepared.
Frippery of all kinds should be eschew

Elaborate silk waists, hats, gowns,
conspicuous jewelry and white gloves
and petticoats should be left at home
or placed in Jj one's traveling trunk.
The wise woman insists upon utility,
style and comfort when planning her
traveling outfit No matter how ex
pensive her hat or suit may be.it is
severely plain, dependent wholly, upon
perfect cut and finish for its chic ap

for a traveling costume, ' showing

According to the statement of a
statistician, visiting cards to the num
ber of 60,000 000,000 are annually put
into circulation by the people of the
world. He says that the pro rata con
sumption is greatest among crowned
heads and royalty generally. Visiting
cards became a social necessity under
the Second Empire.' Lithography was
first employed. in making the visiting
cards of Napoleon, who ordered cards
Â¦rearing his Christian name, only. When
it became known that tht most talksd
of man in Europe was using litho
graphed cards, instead of waiting for
the slower process of engraving, this
style of cards, now relegated to the
ordinary class, became quite the
vogue. Strange, that the use of the
Christian name only Is a prerogative
which kings and emperors share with
servants.
< Napoleon's visiting card was two and
a third inches long and half as broad.
The ex-printer to the Tuilerles still has
a sample, which he Intends presenting
to the National Museum. The fact of
its retaining, up to the present day, its
white and glossy coat . Is due to the
reckless use of tincture of arsenic,
which is thought to have caused much
of the sickness of that period.
The' blonde beauty, Eugenie, first
brought Into favor engraved cards,
though many people of quality used
cards printed from copper plate long
before this famous favorite of the Em
peror became fashion's dictator.
The Chinese claim to have used Yls-*
lting cards as far back as the tint* of
Confucius.' The Koreans use visiting
cards a foot square.

teeth should receive prompt attention,
for they are not only painful but det
rimental to the health. To be sure,
having them extracted is not the most
pleasant recreation, but the agony is
eoon over. The greatest bugbear is
anticipation and people are wont to
dread such an operation for weeks
and are only driven in desperation by
a nerve racking, intolerable toothache.

JANE.â FANCY DRESS PARTIESâ
Dressing in -costume is always a pretty
idea, buf not the most popular form
of entertainment as it -takes both time
and money, and many people prefer
sending their regrets .when they would
gladly attend if their regulation even
ing clothes wduld answer the purpose.
Why not ' try" a 'â¢ fad - party? Let all
jj designate their particular - hobbies in
* some way, though not too plainly, and
award prizes to the one who guesses
- the highest number correctly and to
the booby. .Children's parties are jolly

X. Y. Z.â SHIRT WAISTSâ The fact
that you have but little money to spend
on clothes does not necessarily mean
that you must look the part. You say
you . can sew* neatly and that is more
than half the battle. Do a little win
dow shopping and while you are busily
engaged in this pursuit do not neglect
the laundry windows, for the people
who can offord a French laundry can
afford well made, smart clothes. When
you see a style that particularly catches
your eye deliberately stop and examine
it thoroughly and see how it is made.
Then hie yourself to a department store
and search for a remnant or a pretty,
cheap" material. I have seen waists
that were dainty and very becoming
that cost exactly 24 cent* â 8 cents a
yard arid three yards. â¢ Furthermore
materials that are white or. black and
white always wash well and look far
better than they really are.
fT^HE old adage, that "Pretty Is as
Â¦ . I pretty does," has more truth
I than poetry when it cornea to
: 1 the Question of the mouth and
Â¦ ' teeth. Certainly no one, no
matter how regular the fea
â¢ tures may be, can lay the slightest
claim to beauty If the teeth are not in
the pink of condition. To be sure,
"every one cannot be blessed with a
"pearly set, but in this day of modern
.dentistry it most certainly is within
the power of all to possess at least
presentable ones.
If the upper jaw has too many teeth
to fill it properly and the lip pro

Imajrlne for a single instant that such
â¢ a task is a light one and to be entered
into without due consideration, for if
â¢ â¢ there is one thing on the face of the
earth more painful and nerve shat
tering than another it is the regulating
of teeth. When they are crowded one
or two must be drawn, and frequently
-every tooth in the jaw moved into an
entirely different position. And this
.work must of necessity be slow and
'.sure. Yet, with the fair promise in
sight, there are numerous heartburns
and toothaches, for the apparatus may
â¢ bjreak and the work of months be un
â¢ done in a few moments.
. Teeth, however, that are perfectly
.clean may be irregular and yet not de
tract to a great extent from the face.
Perfectly clean, mind you, does not
mean than one washing in the morn
ing will suffice. Instead it means to
cleanse them thoroughly after eating,
no. matter how frequently this may be.
Every visit to a' dentist proves con
' clusively that part of the regulation
â¢ablutions have been neglected, for
Â¦ preservation of the teeth but spells
â¢ cleanliness if one did but realize and
Â¦ appreciate it.

visable for that matter to carry about
a â¢ toothbrush, but comparatively few

teeth a hasty lick and a promise and
rush off to keep an engagement.
.. In caring for the mouth two articles
I should first be carefully considered â
the brush or brushes and the dentifrice,
.as they are all important. There are
hosts of preparations that may be had
at any chemist's shop, but unless one
â¢' knows the druggist personally it is
better to Insist upon a wash that con
'tains familiar ingredients, as all of
"-them are far from good. Be certain
.that Eoap forms the largest part, as
it Is not only cleansing but alkaline
as well. However, because It is good,
.do not make a practice of using it
alone, as dentists claim it acts upon
: the gums and causes them to recede.
There should be equal parts of water
and alcohol, and any flavoring that is
.best liked, though by far the most
popular" is essence of wintergreen.
; Properly speaking, two brushes
ehould be purchased. One smooth and
Stiff, the other cut In ridges so that the
bristles are In points, for they have a
tray of reaching nooks and crannies
that la especially gratifying and bene
'. ficiaL If one has been accustomed to
Â¦ using a soft brush the stiff one may
. tear the gums, but it is only a matter
of time and a little Judicious care when
..it may be used quite as a matter of
course. Salt, by the way. In a small
quantity of water. Is a simple and ef
fective means of hardening the gums
and will get them Into fairly good con
dition quickly. Â«No matter how painful
;the change may be at first persevere,
" for the stiff bristles alone are equal to
. the task of keeping troublesome tartar
away.
Brush the right Bide of the mouth
with the left hand and vice versa and
treat each individual tooth as though
it was the only one of Importance and
therefore the one to be considered
. most. Brush with a vigorous stroke
up and down and in and out, treating
..the inside quite as well as the outside,
â¢for Mr. Decay is not the least bit par
ticular where he begins his deadly
work and is more frequently found in
put of the way places than elsewhere.
* IH> not think that five minutes'
brushing will accomplish the desired
results eltherÂ«Â«4or most teeth fit so
â¢ closely together that nothing but a bit
of silk or dentist's floss can thoroughly
cleanse the sides. As the last finishing
touch an antiseptic mouth wash
should be used, for it is not only a good
preservative but sweetens the breath
' and is decidedly refreshing as welL
An offensive breath, by the way,
should not be tolerated. And really
there is no good or sufficient reason
for it, though, to be sure, it seems al-'
â¢most" unavoidable occasionally. Gen-.
erally it comes from a disordered
stomach, diseased condition of the
nose or throat and bad teeth* By
dieting the stomach may be quickly
'gotten Into good condition again and
sprays and washes will go a long way
toward purifying the nose. Decayed

erns his life accordingly. Take the
simple matter* of catching a train.
You know that if all goes well you
can do it in half an hour from your
front door. But the forehanded man
leaves himself a little margin of time.
A friend may detain him en route or
there may be some break in the high
way or some blockade of the cars. Or
look at the subject from the point of
view of family or personal expendi
tures. You know that your income
will suffice for the necessaries and now
and then a luxury.
But how about the rainy day which
may set in three months hence, or how
about sending the children away to
school before long? Perhaps you will
be in duty bound to assume the care
of some dependent relative. At all
events, won't you be better prepared
for emergencies If you plan to have
a* little leeway between Income and
outgo, remembering Mr. Mlcawber's
famous adage, "Income Â£20, expendi
tures Â£19 10s; result happiness. In
come Â£20, expenditures Â£20 10s; re
sult misery."
It is well to make allowance, too.
for contingencies in the nature of
tests of character. You may think you
have your temper and your tongue
pretty well under control for the or
dinary strains, but who knows wheth
er before this coming week is half
over some especially Irritating cir
cumstance will arouse a slumbering
demon within you and before you
know it you will have said or done
something which you will regret the
rest of your life? After all, the real
test of a man's virtue is the way he
will behave when he is taken un
awares. Are you laying up some re
serves against that day, so that the
unexpected trial or temptation shall
not destroy or impair your manhood?
Sooner or later, most of us have to
be temporarily set one side, letting the
big world go on with its work without
us for a while. Periods of invalidism
are great crosses for persons of an ac-
disposition, and yet some men
have risen up from sick beds grateful
for the providence which sent them
there and for the lessons learned. What
are you going to think about If you
happen to break your leg and have to
He on a couch for weeks, or If some
sharp sickness Involves a long season
of convalescence? Are you going to
chafe or are you going to be a gentle
man and a Christian and make it com
paratively easy for those who minister
to you to stay near you?
Old age is a contingency for which
we ought to prepare, nay. look forward
eagerly to as the period when our judg
ment may be ripest, our sympathies
with our fellow men keenest, our Influ
ence Jn the world most potent and ben
eficial! One needs something besides
a good-sized bank account when he
passes the seventieth milestone. Life
thereafter Is going to be pretty tame if
one cares for nothing besides the- al
mighty dollar.
And how about the thing to which
at last old age Itself yields? Is not
the future life a contingency for which
It Is high time to' begin preparation?
"Ah," you say, "it is all hazy with
doubt." Well, then, treat It as a con
tingency, but let the mere possibility
of It purify and ennoble your dally
living. Suppose that some day you
wake up and find yourself In a
strangeÂ»^iiew environment, in the
midst of opportunities for ampler,
richer life than you have ever enjoyed
here upon the earth. Suppose that
you find yourself In the presence of a
great searcher of human hearts, to
whom you will have to render strict
account of what you have done with
your time and your talents. Would
you endure the tender yet searching
scrutiny of such a judge? Would you
take your place with the upright and
valiant of all the ages? Would you
go on Into the vast reaches of the fu
ture ever learning more about your
self, the universe and God? The only
way to be ready for such a contin
gency is to heed the solemn admoni
tion of the master of men. who. when
on earth, bade each of his followers
to lay up for himself treasures In
heaven. THE PARSON.

ENGAGED GIRL. (Marking Linen)â
The girl who expects to be married
certainly has plenty to keep her busy
for five or six months if she expects to
make all her underwear by hand and
to embroider all her linen. Really Is it
worth the while? , Months of hard work
combined with entertainments that are
oonstantly being given wear a girl out
and she is so tired she really does not
know what- the matter is with her.
Watch the. sales and buy pretty lin
gerie. Instead of initialing them" by
band, buy the pretty linen ones that
come by the dozen and are so easily
sewed on. They are inexpensive â thir
ty-five cents a dozenâ and make a very
good showing. Hemstitched bed linen
is nice, but it certainly is trying on the
eyes, too. so if you think you cannot
be happy 'Without them, at least sew
the initial' on. Perhaps you do not
realize that sheets and pillow slips are
frequently made with strips of em
broidery in place of the nemstltching,
and It might not be a bad idea to make
a few by way of variety. -

at Hankau, states that wood oil is
rapidly becoming an Important article
of commerce in China, and during the
past year there was something over
$1,890,000 worth of It shipped from
Hankau. Previous to IS 99 only a very
small amount was shipped. But after
Â« report published during that year a
large trade sprang up, until now two
United States firms have located
branches there for the purpose of ex
porting the oil. One of these firms
has since last fall shipped about 200.
00b gallons. The value of the oil is
due to its astringent and drying prop
erties, sÂ«nd it is used In varnish for
the higher grades of furniture. There
are two kinds of wood oil. one being
yellow In color and the other a dark
hue. The former is the one exported.
It being considered of a better quality
than the dark. During the past sea
son the price varied from $4 92 to
$8 05 per picul (133 1-3 pounds). The
great difficulty contended with was the
absence of barrels. The oil when re
ceived by the merchants in Hankau is
in bamboo baskets, lined with oiled
paper. These baskets contain" about
one plcul of oil each. One of the
American firms at Hankau has im
ported shook-; for 5000 barrels and
machinery for setting them up. Last

were planted In California and so far

are not in the least tired and bemoan
and bewail that the fascinating fun Is
about over.
For right royal fun it Is, especially
when your machine Is the first to
reach home port safely and Is intact,
after a run of 150 miles, for some ma
chines accomplish that feat dally, you
know.
Right then and there, ten to one, you
will be so carried away with your out-
Ing that you will involuntarily say.
"Next Sunday please." for California,
not only has a climate that la admir
ably suited for outings, but she pos
sesses & small wilderness at the very
threshold of her largest cities, and It
certainly behooves you. Milady, and
you. Milord, to escape the dust and
smoke of town and find rest, quiet and
a wholesome recreation In the cool re
treats that are offered so plentifully on
all sides.
So here's to the automobile picnics!
THE automobile picnic fever blew
into town on the first syrins
breeze, and the outing girl and
chap caught it In its m|-st malig
nant form. So severely have they
been stricken, in fact, that an outfit
and a trip every week's end Is abso
lutely necessary to their welfare and
happlnets, and nothing under the shtoi
ing sun could prevent them from being
Johnnies-on-the-spot when the ma
chine whirls un to their front door
ready for the fray.
Do you, milord, or you, miladi, care
to enter this fashionable fray, for, of a
truth, an all day's outing means busi
ness as well as fun from early morning
until the inquisitive moon comes out to
t>ee what mischief the world is up to.
If the scores of wooded hills, the min
iature ravines and the tiny, sparkling
brooks that bubble merrily along have
any fascination for you, then follow in
the footsteps of those who leave the
piping hot summer breezes behind and
loiter about in the canyons or the nu
merous suburbs, which are so little
known to the average residents of the
bay cities.
In the first place, unless you are one
of the blessed tribe that is possessed
of enough of this world's filthy lucre to
own a machine, make it your business
to stake one out bright and early, for
Jong before the middle of the week they
have been grabbed up like hot cakes.
All the trouble? of the week that have
vexed and tried the busy man's very
eoul slip away and hide themselves in
the canyons, for the fairy nymph of the
woods demands that all who seek her
companionship shall come with laugh
ter and a merry song.
When certain of your car, plan your
outing and bethink yourself of maps,
for there are so many picturesque spots
within a stone's throw of the city that
Uncertainty station is invariably
reached at the forty-eleventh minute
and the golden opportunity to lead the
merry chase is lost.
From the time you step Into the car
friendly rivalism is openly declared,
and it is t-ach fellow take care of him
self. On Market street a red machine
suddenly spies a white one, and each
lowers its head and mutely acknowl
edges that the chase Is on by a sud
den bound forward.
Biff! Around the corner comes an
other, and down the street they roll,
between care and winding carefully
.in and out. each intent on reaching the
ticket office first in order to secure first
position on the boat. One after an
other glides softly into its allotted cor
ner; and then it is a case of get out,
visit vour neighbors, watch the tinker
ing that invariably follows, and right
then and there proving the superiority
of your oxvn machine and declaring
solemnly that it can beat anything on
the road.
And first position on the boat means
something, mind you, for each driver
fully intends proving each and every
statement, no matter how rash it may
have been. The majority of cars bound
for San Jose cross the bay en the 9
o'clock Creek route, which lands them
at the foot of Broadwav, Oakland.
First on. first off. you know, and a
good start ur> IJroadway generally
means that there is no dust before you,
but a perfect cloud behind, and cer
tainly no one is ambitious to be a dust
eater for a stretch of fifty miles more
or less.
Out Twelfth street you go, over the
bridge to East Oakland, and bv the
time you have whirled through San
Leandro and are half-way to Hay
wards you will see the philosophy of
rigging yourself up in automobile
"togs" from your head to your heels.
And, by the way, there are two
routes which you may take after you
reach San Leandro. One branches off
and runs through Mount J3den. Alva-
rado and Centerville, and the other,
which is far better, runs through De
coto and Hay wards. So if time is an
object the routes will make a vast dif
ference, as you would soon find out to
your sorrow. Haywards. a distance of
eighteen miles, can easily be reached at
10:40 o'clock, and Nlles. just ten miles
farther on, at 11, but the other way
you would lose about three-quarters
of an hour.
Here are a series of don'ts that will
certainly mar your entire day's pleas
ure if you are too proud to follow them
out to the very letter:
Don't wear a hat.
Don't wear your best clothes.
Don't go without glasses and a
veil.
Don't go without a heavy wrap.
For Just as certainly us you do
there will be a peck of trouble brew*
ing. In the first place almost every
hat seems- bent on acting as an im
promptu .sail, und it is first on one ear
and then on the other, duly astride
your nose and finally winds up in the
bottom of the car. where it is general
ly somewhat the worse for wear. In
stead, wear a cap, leather if you in
tend Jaunting about the country every
week or so. for it will shed the dust
and is fashioned on a better, more
pleasing style.
It is all very fine and daisy standing
on the curbstone and laughing when
you sea a man or woman comfortably
be-goggjed, be-veiled and be-leather
ed. Ten to one you shrug your
shoulders and declare that it is all
stuff and nonsense. But when you
are on the road passing everything in
sight and clipping merrily along at
forty miles an hour or so you will
devoutly with that you had some of
that selfsame nonsense within your
grasp. ;\ f ';;*
If your hat does not pull every hair
out of your head it is' only because
you have two hands busily employed
striving to anchor it, for nothing
could induce you to ask ihe driver to
slow down a bit and take things a
tion of all that chances t<> be in their
rath. Talking is practically rut *of the
question, for if you could rnnke your
self heard above the noise the playful
wind would snatch up the words and
fly away with them in high glee, and
you would soon come to the edifying
conclusion that all your brilliant say
ings have been lost -to the world for
ever. So select a noiseless car while
you are at it, for it is far batter in"
more wars than one. It will glide
Fmocthly and quietly along and shoot
by everything on the road so quickly
that you will be a quarter of a mile
ahead before the occupants of the van
quished have come out of their trances
and got un steam.
"I'll give you a brush," one chap
calls to another \t he spies him in
time, and away they go. each giv
ing his neighbor ample room, and

out and walk about a minute and then
you can see the wisdom of wearing
leather coats and long veils. The dust,

and cranny like a soft, white cloud,'
but the leather clad people look as

began as an anti-Chinese uprising, but

messages of Horace N. Allen with ut
â¢ most Interest at this critical time.
â¢ Dr. Allen's career is one of singular
interest, for It has been very seldom
that a foreign diplomat has been re
cruited from the ranks of a missionary
society. Minister Allen knows Korea
from the coollea who ring at their
wbsk in the streets to the Emperor.
For ten years now he has stood at the
helm of American affairs. The posi
tion h&s been difficult, because noth
ing In the way of commercial pro
motion has been sacrificed, and yet
no political or territorial rights have
been asked. More than once the Em
peror of Korea has sought admission
to the American Legation, but it is
not an asylum for political despon
dents, and entrance has been denied
his Majesty. And yet in this time
America has acquired more commer
cial privileges in Korea than all other
nations combined. Through Minister
Allen's efforts concessions for gold
mines, railways and trolley lines were
first glveit to Americans, though hav

From the viewpoint of Americans

the American .doctor's place in Korea;
It was assured. Nothing proved this
so plainly as the attention the King
of Korea now paid Dr. Allen by ap
pointing him the King's physician. Old
as some of the Korean' remedies were,
they seemed to leave something to be
desired. . The' knife and needle were
better than Hot wax; quinine was bet
ter for fever than. the hanging gf rags
on the trees . outside the invalid's
house; f pepsin was better for. indiges
tion' than burning a prayer that had
been written on; paper; the , Korean
doctor who had a stone which, placed
upon a patient's body, enabled its
owner to see into the body and locate
the disease, often made sad mistakes.
There had been a Korean hospital for
400 years, in. Seoul in wKlch 1000 doc
tors were supported at Government ex
pense. In its place, at the King's or
der, an American hospital was erect
ed, called. Hay * Min So-^-the t'House of
Civilized Virtue"â and Dr. Allen was
put In 'charge. Within a year half a
dozen operations were performed in
\ .' .'Â¦'. Â¦ Â¦' ' . '
In 1832 Korea made her first treaty
with any Occidental nation, and that,
singularly enough, was with the United
States. The missionary "society with
which Dr. Allen was connected was
eager to enter the hermit nation, and
soon a cablegram of a Etngle word was
placed In the young physician's â¢ hand
in Shanghai; it read : t "Korea." The
meaning was clearâ an attempt was
now to be made to introcuce Christian
ity to the strange "people in white"
who lived in that unknown peninsula
between Japan and - Northern China.
It was a delicate and dangerous ap
pointment, but by Dr. Allen's intro
ducing himself as a physician it was
believed that the great work of mis
sionary endeavor could be begun. Dr.
and Mrs. Allen went to Korea; and the
right by being born in Ohio â in Dela
ware, in 1858. Nearly all America's
representatives in the Far East had
from the Buckeye State. But from his
appearance it would be right to judge
that be had been raised on one of the
granite hills of New England, for he
is tall and extremely thin in face and
figureâ a living image, in many ways,
of Uncle Sam.
Being graduated with honors from
his home collegeâ Ohio Wesleyan Uni
versityâMr. Allen passed on first to
Columbus and then to the Miami Medi
cal College. Completing his work there
the new-fledged physician set his face
westward to the Far East, and with
his wife â a classmate at Delaware â
went to China as a medical missionary
In 1S83.
Legation and^raised an American flag
over it. ; Allin wrote his American
friends at' Chemulpo that they need
not expect" him and his wife, for they
were not coming. \
."We couldn't if we would," was his
laconic way of putting it, "and *>we
wouldn't if .we could. I came to do
Just such -work. I can't leave these
wounded people. We Ehall live In the
legation with the old flag flying; and
trust the kind Father to care for, us."
So the "Aliens remained in Seoul;
"where buildings were burning, and
bullets now and then whizzing In the
streets.''-' . Â¦ - _ ; Â»-v v â¢ :
The doctor was soon called to the
bedside of 'the mangled Korean
Prince, Min Yong Ik. It was a cru
cial moment in his life; indeed, in the
history- of Americans and American
interests in Korea. A dozen Korean
doctors stood sullenly back when the
'young American physician was intro
duced into the 'sickroom; they had
brought their black wax and were just
ready to melt'ltiand pour it into the
gaping wounds to heal, them. If the
American failed, h!s cause was lost; if
he .succeeded the revolutionists, who
had attempted the Prince's ; life, j would
settle In* their own way with the fool

life they had tried to end.

It is a wise provision of nature and
at the same time one proof of the ex
istence of a higher intelligence than
ours that summer and winter, seed time
and harvest, day and night, succeed
one another with such uniformity. We
would be in a pretty plight if we could
net estimate to a second just when the
sun will to-morrow Deep over the east
ern horizon, or if some clear night we
should look ur> to the heavens and fail
to find our old friends the stars twink
ling down at us. It gives dignity and
tranquillity to life to be in a universe
which moves like clockwork.
There Is a human routine correspond
ing to the order of the universe. The
former is not quits so stable and un
varying, perhaps, as the latter, but It
Is a constant marvel to me that the
work of the world gets Itself done on
the whole so regularly, promptly and
efficiently. See the array of men and
women workers pouring into a great
city between 7 and 9 o'clock every
morning. With but occasional excep
tions each meets his appointment punc
tually at the machine, the counter or
the ledger. And so the total dally out
put of manual and mental energy can
be fairly well forecasted from morning
to morning, and the aggregate of re
sults accomplished by evening is some
thing almost phenomenal. The secret
is that every man in this anny sticks to
his routine.
No one has begun to master himself
if he cannot do that. Now and then a
genius may accomplish much on the
hop, skip and jump method of activity,
but If the rank and file of us are ever to
do anything worth while in the world
it will be because we have learned
â perhaps after considerable self-disci
plineâto rise from our slumbers at a
certain time, take our hats down from
the peg and fare forth to our tasks, to
stick at them until the evening. Our
routine, Instead of being sometljin* to
rebel against, is one of the crowning
blessings of our existence.
But there's a tremendous peril In It,
too. The banker who goes to his office
at such an hour daily Is hardly less
exposed to it than the man who hands
out transfers all day long at a street
railway junction. The great danger is
that the routine will become a rut. If
bo, all the enthusiasm and spontaneity
of action vanish. The man becomes a
machine. We see these human ma
chines on every side. They never take
a vacation. They are always harnessed
up. They would be dazed If the whistle
did not blow in the morning or if on
arrival at the office they had some
novel tasks assigned them. Some one
has aptly said thft tne only differ
ence between a groove and a grave is
a difference of one letter. And every
man of us is in danger of sinking a
little deeper into the groove until it
practically becomes a grave where all
our youthful hopes and ambitions will
lie forever burled.
The remedies? "Well, break away
from the routine now and then. Throw
It aside entirely for a day or a week.
The other day I heard a prominent
New York literary man characterize a
fellow worker in the sphere of letters
in this way: "Jones"â that isn't his
name â "has done a lot of hard and
good work, but he, is everlastingly at
It. He never seems to have^lme for
friendship."
Then, again, we are to find all the
variety we can in our monotonous path.
Phillips Brooks had a characteristic
little habit of personifying the days of
the week so that each represented to
some extent a different kind of work.
Of Thursday, for exaruple, he would
say: "Well, Thursday is a kind of be
tween day. It looks backward to Sun
day and forward to cr.other Sunday."
Are you sure you are getting all the
variety and -,Ice you can out of your
routine? ,
And perhaps the best way to avoid
becoming rutty or groovy is to culti
vate as you labor a sense of the eter
nal significance and worth of the thins
you are doingâ no matter how common
or even menial it seems. Possibly that
sense of eternity was in the mind of
the Master of men when he said. "I
must work the works of him who sent
me while It Is day." THE PARSON.
ROUTINE
Versus
THE RUT
the House of Civilized Virtue every
morning, and nearly 100 dispensary pa
tients came for treatment every after
noon. This was the first institution of
Western civilization ever established ia
Korea.
Dr. Allen's experience wltn Koreans
and the confidence they had in him led
him quickly into a position of promi
nence. In 1S8S the first Korean em
bassy was sent to the United States,
causing a great sensation -in Korea
and a wave of good-humored wel
come in America to the strange visi
tors. It was a delicate matter to en
gineer, and it was to Dr. Allen that
the' Korean King turned to put it
through. Under an appointment as
"Foreign Secretary," Dr. Allen took
the odd-looking party across the sea
and presented them to the President
and safely located them -in Washing
ton.
The establishment of the embassy
was indeed due to Mr. Allen's influence
with the King. The United States
brought a claim against China for the
destruction by 'Koreans of an Ameri
can ship; the Chinese Government an
swered that it had no authority over
Korea, that Korea was an independent
power, and America should demand In
demnity of Korea.
The United States did so and when
the note reached the King he straight
way sent for Dr. Allen and asked him
what it all meant.
The American at once saw that here
was a splendid chance for Korea to
show her independence of China, since
China herself acknowledged it In her
reply; he urged the King to show that
his fcountry was really independent by
sending representatives to the powers
and establishing embassies. He pressed
the point so earnestly that at last the
% Klng consented, and then straightway
selected his Yankee adviser to establish
the embassy in America.
After the Korean embassy was es
tablishedâthe doctor's appointment ex
piring therebyâ Dr. and Mrs. -Allen re
turned to Chemulpo 1 under an appoint
ment from the Presbyterian Board of
Missions. In the same fall he was of
fered and accepted the secretaryship
of Uhe American legation. In 1893 Dr.
Allen represented Korea at the Colum
bian Exposition; in that year also he
was requested by President Cleveland
to return to Seoul as Charge d'Affaires.
In 1897 he was made Resident Minister
and Consul General by President Mc-
Kinley, and In 1901 was appointed En
'voy Extraordinary and Minister Pleni
potentiary.
Through all these years in which
Korea has been the storm center of the
East, Allen's tall figure and long
strides have been familiar on the
streets of Seoul. His long experience j
has fitted him for the work of keep
ing a cool and a clear head at times
when everything seems unsteady. He
has/been strong on three counts.
He has made possible in Korea
works of American promotion which
European capitalists sought but could
not get; the first mining and railroad
concessions in Korea were obtained
for Americans after others had been
refused\ them, because no Korean be
lieved that Americans would make po
litical capital out of any commercial
advantages which might be given
them.
Again, Mr. Allen has had a sympathy
for the missionary interests whltfh has
â¢been exceedingly helpful. Were it not
for him it would perhaps be impossible
far American missionary societies to
point, as they do,- to Korea as the most
fruitful, field, comparatively speaking,
ever opened up In any foreign land.
Rev*. Dr. Arthur J. Brown of the Pres
byterian Missionary Society, after a
recent tour in Asia, affirmed to Presi
dent Roosevelt that Minister Allen was
one of the best American Embassadora
in Asia, his inquiry among the mis
sionaries in Korea having strengthened
*him in this belief.
Finally, Mr. Alien has kept America's
â¢ skirts clear of the tangle of intrigue
which has been weaving in Seoul since
the murder of the Korean Queen in
1895. Yet, In doing this, Mr. Allen has
not sacrificed American Interests blI
any point. The representative of no
nation in Korea has a more united and
sympathetic backing from his fellow
countrymen than the American repre
sentative has in Feoul to-day.
Among the Koreans in their normal
state there is no fear for the aafety
of the head* of the American colony
or any of its members. The Korean
Government handles foughly any one
who insults the foreign representatives.
X-yAXIFORNlA gave her Eastern
I / visitors a complete surprise party
W) ***â¢ Â°ther day. and one that they
'J^ appreciated to its fullest extent.
They had grown weary of shoveling
paths of snow and huddling about try
ing to keep warm, so, at the earliest
opportunity, picked up bag and bag
gage and fled from the eastern half of
the continent Just as fast as they pos
sibly could- Beyond the Mississippi
there were cold rains, snow flurries and
blizzards. The frenzied storm shrieked
Its loudest, shook its fiercest and raged
so furiously that the unfortunates who
had been caught by the storm sylphs
were tempted to raise their* voices and
ehriek aloud with the elements.
But once within the Golden Gate the
.exiles promptly shed their fur coats
and heavy ciothlng and discovered to
their dismay as well as j delight th'at
â¢ they were entirely unequipped for Cali
fornia and her weather. Out here the
flowers were blooming in riotous con
fusion and the birds were flitting from
tree to tree, making day glad with their
joyous songs. The streets were filled
â¢with girls in cheer, white waists and
summer hats and with chaps clad In
the .lightest of the light and topped off
with Panamas. Every home body de
clared it was decidedly warm, but to
the visitors with frozen blood the heat
came as a blessed relief. For a djy or
bo they thought they had found a Par
adise on earth and words were inade
quate to express their delight and won
derment. And then they too joined the
ranks of the merry throng whose chief
aim in life is to find a cooling soda
fountain and a gentle, refreshing Pa
cific breeze. In fact, they even thawed
to such an exvent that they entirely
Â¦forgot that railroads were completely
blocked in great snowdrifts and that
hundreds of telegraph poles had been
blown down or undermined with water.
Such a thing as a fnowplow never en
tered their heads as they basked in the
sun and thoroughly enjoyed those per
fect days that Lowell loved to sing
about.
While Californians thought it was
the hottest spell that they had been
treated to for many a long year, statis
tics say that it really was not. April
14. 1S8S, and April 12, 18S7, were hotter.
On April 9, 1904, the temperature mount
to Â£3 degrees, whereas the other days
mentioned it rose to 88 degrees. This
\vaa all due, eo Professor McAdie of
the Weather Bureau says, to the exist
ence of a great area of high pressure.
The disagreeable weather in the East
was due to an area of low pressure.
Here It was not warm a few hundred
feet in the air. In the stratum of at
mosphere that enveloped California the
radiations from land to water were con
fined and it was hot in consequence, so
warm, in fact, that throughout the en
tire Etate the temperature was about
eight degrees above the normal.
When the Etate Medical Society was
banqueting at Paso Robles in the open
and wondering Just why the sun was
â¢ending forth his hottest rays, an April
blizzard, bringing with It two and a
half feet of snow and sleet, was doing
ltÂ» best to isolate Western Minnesota
and the largest part of North Dakota.
ThÂ« railroad tracks of the Great North

Missouri and Milk rivers were both out

anxiety. Wisconsin came in for her

TIMELY TOPICS OF THE WORLDmatched himselr ten, thousand ..times
against the restless might of the sea;
Immeasurable and .unrestrained, sur
viving the gamut of its moods because.
he was great in strength, fearlessness,
and cunning. He weathered "four, hun
dred gales, from the gray gusts which
come" down between Quid'-Nunc and the
Man-o'-War,- leaping ,upon the; fleet,' ; to
the summer tempests, swift and black,
and the first blizzards of winter. He
was wrecked off the'Mull, off ', the Three
Poor Sisters, on the Pancake Rock, and*
again on the Mull.- Seven times', he was â¢'
swept -to. sea ;by; the off-shore wind.
Eighteen times -he ' was' frozen to the

times his feet were, frozen and, thrice
bis festered right hand. ; All this" he suf

And so he came down to old age â
with a bent back, shrunken arms and
filmy eyes â old Solomon Stride, ' now

Priscilla was not attending; she was

too, waUhed the shadows rise and sul

The men turned their faces to the
window again and gazed long and In

had turned back. "Skipper Luke,

in an enviable . situation, "'tis fine t

"Sure, b'y," said Luke, hesitating
not at all, though he knew to a cent
what was on the books against Solo

broadening gloriously, " 'tis fine, I tells

"Hem-m." the skipper coughed,
pausing to form a guess which might
be within Solomon's dream; then he
ventured: "Fifty dollars?"

Solomon. " 'Twill kape her off the

Priscilla trembled, for Solomon had
come to the time of visionsâ when the.
words of the .dying are the v words of

again. "Goodness an* marcy has fol

against, the return of fish to Luke Dart
fell off from year* to year;, but, as Solo
mon said 'Â¦ to Luke, "llvln" expenses
kep*. up wonderful," notwithstanding.
"I be so used t* luxuries," he went bnj

"Mariy's the quintal o'flsh you traded
with me." . : .
"Sure," i Solomon chuckled; " 'twould
take a_ year t 1 count un."
. In the course of time it came to the
end . of Solomon's first seasonâ those
days of it when, "as the folk of the coast
say, the *, sea is ' hungry Â¦ for.- livesâ and
-the man was 81 years old, and the debt
to Luke . Dart had crept up to $230 80.
The offshore wind, , rising suddenly,
with a blizzard in its train, caught him
alone on the;Grappling;Hobfc grounds.
Â¦â¢He was old, ' very oldâ old .and feeble
and ', dull; , the cold ?. numbed him; : the
snow blinded him f the' wind made sport
of/ the .-strength of his arms. He was
carried out to sea, rowing doggedly,
thinking all the time that he was draw-
Ing, near the harbor tickle; for it did
not occur to hikn that the last of 800
gales could b~e too great for him. He
was carried out from the sea,- where
the strength 'of his youth had been
spent, .to the deep, which' had been a
mystery to him all his days. That
night he passed on a pan of Ice, where
he burned his boat, splinter by splinter,
to keep warm. At dawn he lay down
to die. . "â¢
The snow ceased, the wind changed;
the. ice was carried to Ragged Harbor.
EJeazar. Manuel spied the body of Solo
mon from the lookout and put out and
brought him In. revived him and took
him home to Priscilla.- Through the
winter. the old man. doddered about the
harbor, dying of consumption. When
the tempered days - cameâ the days of
balmy-sunshine and cold evening winds
âhe came quickly to, the pass of.glit

of the lung trouble, come at the end

. In the spring, when the Lucky . Star;
three days out from Boot Bay, put Into
Ragged Harbor to trade - for : the ' first
catch, old: Skipper Luke Â¦ Dart was
aboard,- making his last voyage to the
shore;. for he was very old and longed
once more to see the rocks of all tfiat
coast -before he made ready to die.
When he came ashore, Eleazar Manuel
told him. that Solomon Stride lay dying
at home; so the\ skipper went > to*the
cottage under the " lan-o'-War to .say
good-by to his old customer and friend
âand there found him, proppe'd' up in
- : bed,' staring atthe sea. ' *â¢ t .' ,

evasively.

being given into the . hands of, Ltoke
Dart, an honest man, yielded only suf
ficient provision for food and clothing
for himself and Priscilla â only enough
to keep their bodies warm and still the
crying of their stomachs. Thus, while
the nets of the trap rotted, and
Solomon came near to middle age, the
debt swung from $700 to 57, and bacfcÂ»
to 573, which it was on an evening
in spring, when he s"at with Priscilla
on the sunken bench at the door and
dreamed great dreams, as he watched
the shadows gather over the harbor
water and sullenly hang between the
great rocks, rising all round about.
"I wonder, b'y," said Priscilla, > "if
'twill be a good season â this year." '
"Oh, sure!" exclaimed Solomon.
"Sure!" '//iTV -'?Â¦
"D'ye think It, b'y?" wistfully.
"Woman," said he, impressively,
"us'll cotch a hape o* fish in the trap
this year. They be millions o' fish
t* the say," he went on excitedly." They
be there, woman. â¢ 'Tis oan'y for us t'
take un out. I be goin' to wark hard
this year." Â¦-.?..;
"You be a great warker, Solomon,"
said she; "my, but you be!"
Priscilla smiled, and Solomon
smiled, and it was as though all the
labor and peril of the season were
past and the stage were full to the
roof with salt cod. In the happiness
of this dream they smiled again, and
turned their eyes to the hills, from
which the glory of purple, and yellow
was departing to make way. fop the
misty dusk.
"Skipper Luke Dart says t' me,"
said Solomon, "that 'tis , the' luxuries
that keeps folk poor."
Priscilla said nothing at all.
"They be nine dollars again me In
seven years for crame o* tartar," said
Solomon. "Think o' that!"
"My," said she, "but 'Us a lot! But
will be used to un now, Solomon, an'
we can't got along without un."
"Sure," said he, " 'tis good we're not
'poor like some folk."*
In thirty years after that time Solo
mon Stride put to sea ten thousand
times. Ten thousand times he passed
through the tickle rocks to the free,
heaving deep for salmon and cod,
thereto compelled by the inland waste,
which contributes nothing to the sus
tenance of the men of that coast. Hun
ger, lurking In the shadows of days to
come, inexorably drove him into! the
chances of the conflict. Perforce he
good times or bad. I'll pay for un,
skipper, with the first fish I cotches."
Said Luke Dart: "When I trust,
b'y, I trust. You pays for un when you
can."
It was a compact, so at the end of
the season Solomon builded a cottage
under the Man-o'-War, Broad Cove
way. and married a maid of the place.
In five months of that winter he made
the trap, every net of It, leader and all,
with his own hands, that he might
know that the work was good to the
last knot and splice. In the spring he
put up the stage and the flake and
made the skiff; which done, he wait
ed for a sign of fish. When the tem
pered days came he hung the net on
the horse, where It could be seen from
the threshold of the cottage. In the
evenings he sat with Priscilla on the
bench at the door and dreamed great
dreams, while the red sun went down
in the sea and the shadows crept out
of the wilderness.
"Woman, dear." said this young Sol
omon Stride, with a slap on his great
thigh. " 'twill be a gran* season for fish
this year."
"Sure, b'y," said Priscilla, tenderly; j
" 'twill be a gran* season for fish."
"Ay," Solomon sighed, " 'twill thatâ
this year."
" 'Tis handy t* three hundred an* fifty
dollars I owes Luke Dart for the
twine/* mused Solomon.
*' Tis not much," said Priscilla, smil
ing, "when you has a trap."
"Us'll pay un all up this year," said
Solomon.
"SuFel" said she, echoing his con
fidence.
"Us'll pay un for a trap, dear,"
chuckled Solomon, "an* have enough
left over t' buy a â "
"Oh," she cried, with an ecstatic
gasp, "a sewin* machane!"
"Iss.** he roared. "Sure, girl.**
But In the beginning of the season,
when the first fish ran In for the
caplln and the nets were set out, the
ice was still hanging off shore, drift-
Ing vagrantly with the wind; and
there came a gale in the night, spring
ing from the noifcheast â a great, vi
clous.wind, which gathered the ice
in a pack and drove it swiftly in upon
the land.
Solomon dragged the trap from the
bottom. Great holes were bruised in
the nets, head rope and. span line were
ground to pulp, the anchors were lost.
Thirty-seven days and nights It took**
to make the nets whole again, and In
that time the great spring run of cod
passed by. So in the next spring Solo
mon was deeper in the debt of sym
pathetic Luke Dart- â for the new
twine and for the winter's food he
had eaten; but of an evening when
he sat on the bench with Priscilla he
looked through the gloaming shad
ows gathered over the harbor water
and hanging between the great rocks
to the golden summer approaching
and dreamed gloriously of the fish
he would catch in his trap. B3I
"Priscilla, dear," said Solomon
Stride. . slapping his Iron thigh, "they
be a fine rfgn o* fish down the coast.
Twill be a gran* season, I'm thlnkln'."
"Sure, b'y," Priscilla agreed; "'twill
be a gran' cotch o* fish you'll have this
year." .
"Us'll pay Luke Dart this year, I
tells you," said Solomon, like a boast
ful boy. ) "Us'll pay him twice over."
â¢"Twill be fine to have the ma.
chane." said she, with shining eyes.
"An* the calico f use un on," said
he.
" Twill be fine." said she.
It chanced in that year that the fish
failed utterly; hence the winter follow

distress; and three old women' and one

LONG ago, when young Luke

virtues. Such are for others to dis
cover. The matrimonial advertiser
confines himself to simple statement of
fact; he is "considered agreeable." He
is domestically inclined, and in receipt
of a rood income. He Is desirous of
meeting a lady of serious disposition,
with view to matrimony. If possessed
of meansâ it Is a trifle hardly worth
considering one way or other other; he
floes not insist upon it; on the other
hand, he does not exclude ladles of
means; the main idea Is matrimony. It
Is sad to reflect that a young lady said
.to be good lookingâ let us say good
looking and be done with it A neigh
borhood does not rise up and declare a
iglrl good looking if she is not good
.locking. That Is only her modest way
jof putting it Let us say a young lady
good looking, well educated, of affec
tionate disposition. It is sad to reflect
âI repeat itâ that such a one, matri
monially inclined, should be compelled
to have recourse to the columns of a
. xsatrtmonial Journal. What are the
young men in the neighborhood think
ing of? What more do they want? Is
it Venus come to life again with ten
thousand a year,, that they are waiting
for? It makes me angry with my own
eex reading these advertisements. And
when one thinks of the girls that do
get married.
(Ccpyrlrhtfrd. 1901. by Central News Â»nd Frew
One of the first things I should take
In hand .were European affairs handed
over to my control would be- the". re-,
arrangement of .this- carnival business.
As matters are at -present the carnival
takes place all. over Europe In Febru
ary. At Nice, in Spain. Win Italy it
may be occasionally possible to feel yoiif
want to dance about the streets in thin,
costume during February. But in more
northern -countries during '.carnival
time I have seen only one sensible
masker: he was & man who had got
himself up as,,' a diver.' It was in'Ant
werp, the rain was pouring down . In
torrents; -a cheery boisterous John Bull
sort of an east wind was bluster-hit "
through the streets at the rate of fif
teen miles an hour. Pierrots, with
frozen hands,' were blowing blue noses.
An elderly Cupid had borrowed an .um
brella from a cafe and was waiting" for
a tram. A very little devil 'was crying
with' the cold and wiping his eyes with
the end of his own tall. Every, door
way was crowded with shivering mask
ers. ' The diver alone walked erect, the
water streaming from him. February
is not the month for open air mas
querading. The, "confetti," which has
come to be, nothing: but. colored paper
cut Into email discs. Is a sodden mass.
When a lump of It strikes you in the
eye your Instinct Is not to laugh gayly,
but to find out the man : who threw. it
arid to hit hlni back.. This is, not the
true spirit of carnivai. --The : maryel- Is,
that In spite *of the almost invariably
adverse weather these carnivals' still
continue.,. In Belgium, where Catholi
cism still remains '. the dominant re
ligion, carnival maintains, itself
stronger than elsewhere in Northern
Europe. At one small town,* Binche,
near the French border, it holds unin
terrupted sway for three .days and two
nights; during which time the whole
population, swelled by visitors frym
twenty - miles around, shouts, romps,
eats and drinks Â¦ and dances. After
which the ; visitors are packed, like
sardines into '. railway trains.' j They
pin their tickets to. their coats '.and
promptly go to Bleep. At every sta
ticn the railway officials stumble up
and down the trains with lanterns. The
Â¦last feeble effort of the more wakeful
reveler, before he adds himself to the
heap of snoring humanity on the floor
of the railway, carriages. Is to change
the tickets of a couple of his uncon-
Know he Is a clever man. It avoided
the necessity of explanatlqn. 1 Unfor
tunately the fashion has gone out. We
wise men have to wear just ordinary
clothes. Nobody knows we are wise
men. Â¦ Even when we tell them so they
don't believe it. It is this th,at makes
our task more difficult Â¦Â» â¢
enough to shine the slsht Is a pretty
one. How they love the dressing: up
and the acting, these small mites! One
young hussy â she could hardly have
been more? than 10^-was got up as
a haughty 'younjgfady. Maybe some
elder, sister had served her as a model.
She wore a tremendous wig of flaxen
hair, a hat -that I guarantee would
have made its mark even at Ascot on
the- cup day. a" skirt that trailed two
yards behind her,' a pair of what had
once been white kid gloves and a blue
silk, parasol. ' Dignity! I have seen
the offended barmaid, I have met the
chorus girlâ not by appointment,
please don't misunderstand me. merely
as a spectatorâ up the river on Sunday,
but never have I witnessed tn any hu
man being so much hauteur to the
pound, avoirdupois, as was carried
through the streets of Charlerol by
that small brat. Companions of other
days, mere vulgar boys and girls,
claimed acquaintance with her. She
passed them with a stare of such ut
ter disdain that it sent them tumbling
over' one another . backward. By the
time ' they had7- recovered themselves
sufficiently to think of an old tin kettle
lying handy in the gutter she had
turned the corner. Two miserably
clad urchins, unable to -scrape together
the few sous necessary for the hlra of
a rag or two, had nevertheless ' deter
mined not to be altogether out of it.
They had managed to borrow a couple
of white blousesâ not what you, would
understand by a white blouse, dear
madame. a dainty thing of frills and
laces, but the coarse white sack . the
street sweeper wears over his other
clothes. They had also borrowed t a
couple of brooms. Ridiculous littla ob
jects, they looked, only the tiny head
of each showing above the- great white
shroud as gravely they, walked, the one
behind the other sweeping the -mud
fnto the gutter. They also were of tho
carnival, playing at being scavengers.
Another quaint sight I witnessed, com-'
ing sharply round the corner of a by
street. The "serpentine" is a feature
of the Belgian carnival. It is a strip
of colored paper, some , dozen yards
long, perhaps. You fling it as you
would a lasso, entangling, the head of
some passerby. Naturally the object
most aimed at by the Belgian youths
is the Belgian maiden. And, naturally
also, the maiden who finds herself most
entangled is the maiden whoâ to use
again the language of the matrimonial
advertiserâ is "considered good-look
ing." The serpentine about her head
is the "feather in her cap" of the Bel
gian maiden on carnival day. Coming
suddenly round the corner I almost
ran into a girl. Her back was toward
me. It was a very quiet street, leading
Into another quiet street. She had half
a dozen of these serpentines In her
pocket. Hurriedly, with trembling
hands, she was twisting them round
and round her own head. I looked at
her as I passed. She flushed scarlet.
Poor little snub-nosed, pasty-faced
woman! I wish she had not seen me.
I could have bought six-penny worth
of serpentines, followed her and tor
mented her with them; while she
would have pretended Indignation,
sought discreetly to escape from me.
Down South, where the blood flows
quicker, King Carnival is indeed a
Jolly old soul. In Munich he reigns tor
six weeks, the end coming with a mad
two days* revel In the streets. During
the whole of the period folks in ordi
nary every-day costume are regarded
as curiosities; people wonder what they
are up to. From the Grafen to the
Dienstmadschen, from the Herr pro
fessor to Rlccolo, as they serve to
make antics that answers to our page
boy, the business of Munich Is danc
ingâsomewhere, somehow, in a fancy,
costume. The costume ball is every
where â at the palace, at the Beer hail.
Every theater clears away the stage,
every cafe crowds Its chairs and tables
Into corners, the very streets are
cleared for dancing. Munich goes mad.
But, then, that does not mean It goes
far. Munich is always a little mad.
The maddest ball I ever danced at was
In Munich. I went there with a.Har
vard University professor. He had
been told what these balls were like.
Ever seeking knowledge of all things,
he determined to take tho matter up
for himself and examine it. The writer
also must ever be learning. I agreed
to accompany him. We had not intend
ed to dance. Our Idea was that we
would be indulgent spectators. regard-
Ing from some coign of vantaja ths
antics of the foolish crowd. The pro
fessor was clad as became a professor.
Myself, I wore a simply cut frock coat,
with trousers In French fray. The
doorkeeper explained to us that
this was a costume ball; he was
sorry, but gentlemen could be admitted
only In evening dress or In mas
querade. It was half-past 1 In the
morning. We had sat up late on pur
pose; we had gone without our
dinner; we bad walked two miles. Tha
professor suggestsd pinning up the tails
of his clerically cut coat and turning
In his waistcoat. The doorkeeper
feared It would not be quite the sama
thing. Besides, my French gray
trousers refused to adapt themselves.
The doorkeeper proposed our hMnjr â¢
costume â a little speculation of his
own; gentlemen found it simpler seme
times, especially married gentlemen, to
hire a costume In this manner, change
ing back into sober garments before
returning home. It reduced the volume
of necessary explanation. "Have you
anything, my good man," said the pro
fessor, "anything that would effect a
complete 'disguise?" The doorkeeper
had the very thingâ a Chinaman with
combined mask and wig. It fitted neat
ly over the head and was provided with
a simple but Ingenious piece of mechan
ism by means of which much could be
done with the pigtail. Myself the door
keeper hid from view under the' cowl
of a Carmelite monk. "I do hope no
body recognizes us," whispered my
friend, the professor, as we entered. I
can only hope sincerely that they' did
not I do not wish to talk about my
self; that would be egotism. But the
mystery of the Harvard professor
troubles me to this day. A grave,
earnest gentleman, the father of a fam
ily, I saw him with my own eyes put
that ridiculous pasteboard mask over
bis head. Â¦ Later onâ a good deal later
onâ I found myself walking again with
him through silent starlit streets.
Where he had been in the interval and
who then was the strange creature un
der the Chinaman's mask will always
remain to me an unsolved problem.

San frangisco, -Sunday, mAy? 15, 1904. v
Manchesterâ a royal residence irj.Ire
land is the Duchess of Roxburghe."Her
recent visit to Ireland was mainly di
rected toward that object. She had an
interview with a firm of estate agents
in Dublin, who have a monopoly of
negotiating the leasing and sale of the
finest residences in Ireland. As a re
sult Tanderagee Castle, which at pres
ent belongs to the Duke and Duchess
of Manchester, is likely to be the fu
ture Irish home of the Duchess of Rox
burghe. The Manchesters have decid
ed that Kylemore is to be their per
manent residence in Ireland and that
therefore their occupation of Tander
agee would be unnecessary extrava
gance. The Duchess of Roxburghe has
been, over the castle and it la under
stood that she is satisfied with its size,
equipment and general surroundings.
It cannot compare with Kylemore, but
It is the best place available In Ireland
at the moment.
ROXBURGHES HOUSE HUNTING.
' Meantime the Duke and Duchess are
looking out for a favorable spot In the
fashionable quarters of London upon
which to erect a town residence. A
site in Mayfair, close to where the new
residence of the Duke and Duchess of
Marlborough stands, was submitted to
t them,- but the pNdce. asked was so ex
orbitant In the estimation of the Duke
that it Â¦ was "declined _, with thanks."
Fashionable real estate agents know
that they are looking out for a site
and,- as ' there is not much competition
in this particular direction the Duke
and 'Duchess are bound. to pay dearly
for the luxury of a town residence.
It-is not generally known that the
great London landlords, such as the
Duke* of *Westminster, who. owns nearly
'â¢11' 'the fashionable part of the West
as to where they can obtain suitable
estates if Ireland is to nave a royal
residence. Strangely enough, the first
to anticipate â after the Duchess of
sex. had no less than thirty-two male
descendants at the front. â¢
The brilliant marriages of the daugh
ters of the first Duke and Duchess of
Abercorn are often commented upon in
society, for one married the 1 Earl of
Lichfleld, another the Duke of Buc
cleuch, another the Earl of Winterton,
another the Marquis of Lansdowne, and
another the Marquis of Blandford. The
Marchioness of Blandford, however, got
been through the divorce court, either
'as plaintiff or defendent, was ever al
lowed to go to court again, but when
the Marchioness of Blandford divorced
her husband, so' moved, to pity was
Queen Victoria on learning what the
society woman had endured so long
that she made in her case the exception
that she was afterward to be welcomed
at court. This exception has since been
made for every one who goes through
the divorce court as the injured party.
LANSDOWN'ES MORE LIBERAL.
Though, on account of her husband's
official position (he is now Secretary for
Foreign" Affairs), Lady Lansdowne is
hardly able to cut down her visiting

old London, a passage with a flight of
stone steps at one end, running from
Curzon street to Hay Hill, and known
as Lansdowne Passage.*
In these days when folks are pushing
and anxious "to "get there," the diffi
culty of maintaining an exclusiveness
such as' is practiced by these excep

beyond comprehension. There is great
] difficulty; in defeating jj the tactics of
"undesirables," as the 'following inci

man on behalf of a woman friend who
was most anxious to obtain a card of
invitation. V The .;. Duchess answered
that she was sorry, but that she "really

explained; "I am too 111 to move. I

TWO MEMBERS OF MOST EXCLUSIVE OF LONDON'S ARISTOCRATIC CIRCLE.
- LONDON", May 14.â Society In Lon

'houses of the British aristocracv into
which the man of millions, no matter
what Influence he might be able to
b.uy and command, has never yet
pained the entree. A plutocrat of Ques
tionable origin may succeed in securing
" an invitation to be received *y Dukes
and Duchesses, even to dine with them.
. -He may meet the King, perhaps be one
Â¦of King Edward VII's most intimate
â¢Â¦friends, and yet have not the remotest
.chance of entering this most select cir
cle of English society.
â¢ There are hostesses eo exclusive that
they would rot consider for a moment
acknowledging a mere bow from scores
of King: Edward's constant friends, or
Irom many of those who are Intimately

One of the most particular of those
' haughty dames Is Lady Leconfleld, an-
J other is the Duchess of Buccleuch, and

position makes it quite impossible for
her to be as rigidly exclusive as she
would privately wish, is the latter'a
sister, the Marxhioness of Lansdowne.

tread of warriors throughout so many
â¢ienturirs, suggested that they might be

In accordance with what she be
lieves to be due to her aristocratic
lineage. Lady Leconfield is extremely
cold and haughty. Most rigorously
does â¢ ehe set her face against the

nouveau riche. She is fiercely opposed
â¢to that spirit which does not refuse to

Dick and Harry, and much lees likely
*tould she be to acknowledge the wives
of Tom. Dick or Harry.
Lady Leconfield practices exclusive

their church at Petworth the Lecon

,lt is not impossible, by the way, that
this may have had something to do
with the very bad matches which have

However, no family, however censor

private skeleton in the cupboardâ the
contemplation of which might be ex

her home in exclusive grandeur at

securing people and scenery to produce,
for the first time in California, th*
Passion Play, and he brought these to
Monterey at great expense. In her
young days Mrs. Larioa was. known far
and wide as the Spanish dancer

advent of the Americans. She was
twice married and Is now the widow pf

owner of the originaf" Santa Ana
Rancho and the greater portion of the
land on which is built up the town of

the standards of excellence in acting,

"Cyrano de Bergerac," "King Henry
V," "Beaucaire," "Julius Caesar," "Old
Heidelberg" and "Ivan the Terrible"
made this chapter of dramatic his

San Francisco the most eminent- actor
and manager of, his generation.
It. is characteristic of Mansfleldlan
prodigality that, though he might well
carry his fortnight Irere triumphantly
with a single play, one of those involv

an elaborate repertoire, embracing sev
eral of his most massive productions
and requiring an organization of 106
people. He comes with , one handicap,
however. It will be difficult for Mans
field to take his audiences by surprise.
Much is anticipated, which is always
a formidable burden for an artist.
To-morrow night Mr. Mansfield pre
sents his great production and charac
ter of "Ivan the Terrible," written by
Count Alexis Tolstoy and first pro
duced in English, by Mr. Mansfield at
the New Amsterdam Theater on March
1 last, with the most pronounced tri

Mr. Mansfield's return marks his first

I looked and smiled at madame. She
looked -and smiled back. Then the
great prima donna said, drawing up
her chair to whisper, and with her fin
ger on her lip: "She thinks she is my
husband! 'You must not do this,' 'You
must not do that,' she tells me. And
'You must put on this shawl,' and 'You
must take this milk,' she says," and
madame actually pouted. "She will
come and take me away if I do not
go, I think!"
And so" we said good-day. It isn't all
beer and skittles to own a "throat of
goldâ" unless it is a castiron one like
Schumann-Heink's. In that case you
may get frankfurters, too.
Daughter of the Regiment,* 'L'Elisir
D'Amore,' 'Magic Flute' and all those
things you have kept for New York,"
I prophesied, fervently.
Madame, laughed. "Perhaps."
"Wonderful what a vogue the old
Italian operas have h?d this last sea
son," Mr. Edmunds exclaimed. "Time
was when you could hardly get a cor
poral's guard for anything but Wag
ner. But 'Lucia/ 'Puritan!, ' all of
them, were sure of full bouses."
"What operas do you lÂ»ke_. best,
madameâ for yourself," asked her.
"Of course. Mozart," madame re
plied, "but there are Verdi, Donizetti,
Rossini, oh, many others. I like 'Die
Fledermaus' â may sing the part of
Rosalinda this season."
"Did you like the 'Manru* of Pader
ewski â I saw that you had created
the soprano role."
Â¦ "I like it," madame returned, de
cidedly, "a beautiful tenor part."
"And the Richard Strauss opera
'Feuersnoth,' how Is that?"
"Ah, that I have not heard,- But my
husband says it is very good," and
Dr. Stengel, who rapped * poor little
Marcella Kohansky's tired knuckles for
her when he taught her to play piano
âall-unknowing that the child was
playing dance music 'almost all night
and practicing all dayâ this same Dr.
Stengel is evidently still the same au
thority to Marcella Sembrich.
"Will Herr Conried produce Pucci
ni's 'Madame Butterfly' this season â
you are to sing It, I know?"
"Not yet,' I know," Sembrich an
swered. "It is difficult to produce the
new things. One is rather afraid."
"And 'Madame Butterfly' did not go
so well- at its premiere â in Milan, I'
think," I said. "Still, 'Carmen' failed,
and who knows how many more op
eras at their debuts. 'Zaza,' too. You
Know we have had 'Zaza' here?"
"You have had all things here,"
madame laughed. " 'Andre Chenler,'
La Tosca,' 'Zaza'â how you like It?"
â¢ "Quite well," I averred.
"The part is good," I think," madame
said. "I like very.' well the modern
Italians, but mostly they are too dra
matic for my voice."
"But you have "sung Wagner, mad
ame "
"Only Elsa and Eva," she retiirned.'
Then, on the shining redwood. of the

THE FAMOUS PRIMA DONNA DISCUSSES HER ART.
So I fear when I come here. And then
one sings not so well. And people â
;ih! they are cruel! They remember
so badly the good things and remem
ber so well If one sings once out of
the key. or the note that breaks." It
Mas the artist, shudderlngly sensitive,
that spoke.
I interrupted the uncomfortable
truth with this: "They tell me,
madame, that you were the only singer
who never disappointed the audience
during the last grand opera season."
"It is true," madame smiled, as she
knocked gravely on the rosewood desk,
and then, with exquisite graciousness
added, I thank you."
"Madame has sung sixty-four times
this season," her manager added.
"Which do you prefer, the concert
or operatic work?" I asked.
"Opera is easier," the singer began.
"You see, She has only one or two
big arias and a little recitative in
opera," Mr. Edmunds continued.
"And one must stand so," â the
singer primly clasped her hands, stif
fened herself and pursed her lips as
she spoke â "in concert. When one Is
acting one can throw off the restraint.
It is easier to sing so. How do you
think the Alhambra is for sound?"
"Very good," I witnessed. "Does it
feel so to you?"
"Very agreeable," the singer said.
"Sometimes it feels to me as though I
were singing at a wall"â she put up
her hands before her face to illustrate
â "there, no. It feels very free for the
voice. And your audiences here" â it
was after her first concerts â "are so
good. How well they know the lleder!
I was surprised. It is charming to
sing for them. You must have many
Germans here."
"Oh, yes." I told her, "but the Schu
mann, Schubert and Brahms Jieder are
pretty well known to most of the con
cert-goers. We are not wholly ignorant
of Wolf, Strauss and Loewy, either,"
I boasted in conclusion.
"You know that is exceptional,"
madame said, gravely, complimentary.
"I must sing in many places almost
entirely the operatic repertoire. And I
so love the lleder."
"I was delighted with your Strauss
songs," I exclaimed.
"They are beautiful â n'est ce pas'."
she cried, her eyes glinting golden
fire.
When madame, by the way, is not
using her exquisitely pretty and
formal English she runs off Into fluent
French. And she lives in Dresden,
where they certainly used to speak
German, though not so charming a3
madame's. And Italian opera is her
forte. But none of these are to her
what that fiery Polish is, in which she
electrified us in the Lubomirski ma
zourka last Tuesday night. For a
change, however, she takes the
Tschaikowsky "Lullaby" In its native
Russian!
"Strauss is a great man," she went
on. "The 'Caecilie' I think a beautiful
song. Oh, so many there are!"
"I rather hoped you would sing some
of the Hugo Wolf songs," I suggested.
"Schumann-Heink gave us the 'Helm
weh* and Denis O'Sullivan the 'Anac
reon's Grab.' "
"I would also like to sing something
of his," madame said, clasping her
hands in delicate enthusiasm. "The
'Storcnenbotschaft,' " she cried. " 'The
Storks,' you know. It is lovely." ,
"Sing it." I suggested.
"But my programme is already made
up," she demurred. "Still I will change
it. I will sing lieder instead of the
last ariaâ yes, Mr. Edmunds. Here they
will like it. They understand."
"The Russian lieder â " I suggested.
"I will sing a lullaby of Tschaikow
sky," she decided; "a Polish song, too."
And that is how Madame Sembrich
came to pay us the pretty compliment
of singing five Wholly new songs on her
last programme in place of her accus
tomed aria.
We began then to talk of the Rus
sian group of composers, and Mme.
Sembrich owned to an enthusiasm for
Arensky's, Tschaikowsky's arid other
Russian lieder. She ended by saying:
"I have tried to persuade Herr Conried
to produce 'Yevgenljie Onegin 1 â one of
Tschaikowsky's seven operas â at the
Metropolitan." Vf
"When are you going to bring Mr.
Conried out here?" I asked, "next sea
son? No! Not really!" for madamp
and Mr. Edmunds had both nodded a
sort of affirmative.
"It is not settled," madame tem

of "Ivan the Terrible"; Wednesday,
the last time of Beau Brummel";
Thursday, "Old Heidelberg"; Friday
night, Mr. Mansfield's only appearance
in his celebrated and original charac
terization, "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde";
Saturday, last matinee, last time and
only matinee of "Old Hedelberg," and
Saturday (farewell night), Mr. Mans
field will appear in a scene from each
of the five plays of his repertoire.
One word in regard to the question of
seats. The Mansfield seat sale during
the last three days has been a record
â¢ breaker. Many thoughtless gossips are
carrying abroad tales of difficulty in
securing seats. The management do
sires to announce that there are seats
for all performances at any price, and
no one should abandon the idea of
seeing Mansfield without applying at
the box office of the Columbia. Many
people imagine that to get good seats
they must reach ahead toward the end
of this week, or into next week. Obvi
ously a concerted belief of this sort
would leave an opening for those wise
enough to ask for seats for the earlier
performances.
It is a setting of a poem by one of

Henry Purcell. The only man who can
contest with Elgar for this distinction
is Sir Arthur Sullivan, whose finest
jvork, was at the very opposite pole
from Elgar's.
The performance of Edward Elgar's
cantata, "The Dream of Gerontlus," by
the Oratorio Society has shown that
there is in England at least one com
poser of original and highly Imagin
ative powers, who is able to go outside
of the conventional ruts in which Eng
lish music has so long traveled. "The
Dream of Gerontius" is perhaps the
one product of llngllsh musicianship
for a period measurable only in gener
ations that is not founded upon the
sacred models of Handel and Men
delssohn, and that may, at the same
time, be considered entirely English In
its sources and in its inspiration. It Is
by a thorough-going Englishman who
has gained all' his training in his native
land, acquiring knowledge and experi
ence by hard work in minor positions
in English bands and choir lofts and
by his own study of scores; and, so far
as the record tells us, has never had the
time or the means even to listen to the
music of Germany, France v or Italy on
its native soil.- V^_/
Here Is what Richard â¢ Aldrlch, thÂ©
erudite musical critic of the New York
Post, has to say of -Elgar's "Dream of
Gerontlus," that will be given here for
the first time this week by the San
Francisco Music Club, under Dr. H. J.
Stewart's direction. Mr. Aldrlch
speaks, of a New York performance of
the work.
Well, "la commedia e flnlta," la tela
cade. The season's all over, the last
note Bounded, and that last note Mar
cella Sembrich's.
Truth to tell, and I should count my
self an ill friend of Sembrieh'3 to say
otherwise, her present visit has been
so/nethlng of a disappointment. At her
first concert the singer was obviously
out of trim; her second found her with
recovered poise, but with still strained
upper notes; the third, though again
more satisfying, demonstrated the fact
that the voice needs rest. I do not be
lieve that Sembrich is "losing -her
voice." Sixty-flvÂ© appearances In one
season, with the incidental fatigue of
travel, to an exquisitely sensitive or
gan like the lyric soprano voice, spells
an easily comprehensible fatigue. Add
to this the singer's curious but not ill
founded superstition as to her ill-luck
in San Francisco â fear directly affects
the breath, and the breath is the life
of the voice, with her anxiety concern
ing a possibly dying mother 5000 miles
away In Dresden, and one need look no
further for cause. Besides, there were
notes at the end of the third pro
gramme getting on to that superb ring-
Ing mellowness that we know as the
Sembrich voice. But, distinctly, sha
needs the rest. There were notes pain
ful in their evidence of strain at all the
concerts. And least of all can we af
ford to lose Marcella Sembrich. It was.
I think, rather than for any artistic
reason, the magnificent sufficiency of
Schumann-Heink's voice that has led to
the many absurd comparisons floating
about. As well compare a nightingale
with an eagle! When it comes to the
matter of personal pleasure obtained
from one or the other c 'est autre
chos^e. Artistically they cannot be com
pared.
They work with mediums entirely
different. Sembrich's is the Jewelry of
song, the point lace, the light sigh, the
young laughter, the prattle of angels.
Schumann-Heink's is the voice of the
oak, the storm, death, life, Homeric
mirth, child's sorrow. Sometimes one
impinges upon the other's domain. The
dramatic r>assion of Sembrich'a Lubo
mirski "Mazurka" â her native Polish â
with which the singer crowned her last
concert, was, I think, startling to her
warmest admirer.
The last concert altogether was of
larger significance. The singer's choice
in omitting such numbers as the Strauss
valse and the Arditi "Parla" in defer
ence to our tastes and in accordance
with her own desires, was a distinct
compliment. But one is left with many
profoundly beautiful memories of the
season. Schumann "Nussbaum," celes
tially delicate, the rare comedy of the
"Wolf "Stcrchenbotschaft." the light and
fire of the mazurka aforesaid, her de
licious Mozart, the "Mon Petit Coeur
Soupire." with its last five wonderful
notes sent floating like rcseleaves on
morning airs. Then there was the
Strauss "Caecilie," the Schumann
"Auftraege," the Brahms "Wie Melo
dien Zieht es mir," the Bizet "Pas
torale" â let us ever be grateful. No
other song, perhaps, has the absolute
perfection of mechanism of Sem
brich's. The phrase, who else builds
it with Quite the exquisite accuracy,
begins', rounds, colors, and ends it as
does Sembrich. The relation of the
musical sentences, the plan of the
whole, is just as exquisitely maintain
ed. Technically, singing can go no
further, and the scales, trills, turns,
arpeggi, are perfect, the attack like no
other in its absolute sureness. The vo
cal quality is purely luscious, but with
the fatigued strain as before said. Still
the experience has been profoundly de
lightful. One can only wish for her
speedy return â after her rest.

And here bejran the roseleaves â the
roseleaves, thick fallen showers of

in their sheltering: midst. Her tem

;ilso tenderly anxious for the prima
donna's well being. It was in the air,
and we ourselves, by the time the
stately little figure appeared, felt in- ,
dined to whisper as at a royal au
dience.
Had I done as instinct suggested I
should have kissed the gracious little
.hand madame held out. I remembered
in time, however, that I was not at
court, but at the St. Francis, and
rixnply shook the small, be-diamonded

.with her newspaper photographs,
madam smilingly demurred.
â¢ But The Call was different.
Well, then. And the singer seated
herse!f at her writing desk against a
luxurious background of La France
- roses.
â¢'You must make me youngâsix
. teen." she laughingly commanded,
with the royal coquetry of a Princess,
"and slim and tall."
"You are slimmer than you were dur
ing th'? grand opera season, madame,"
I testified.
Madame did not spring up joyfully
here as Schumann-Heink would have
done, either to shake or caress one.
But she did look pleased, and confessed
â¢to walking six and seven hours a day
during her vacations as a preventive
measure.
"How do you wish me?" she asked
then.
"I like the profile, madame," I ven
"Profile is always better," she hu
morously decided, "one sees not so
much of the face." '
So, at first, she turned her expres
sive profile to the camera and I had
time to take my first good look at
Marcella Sembrich. Ah, there In the
firm chin and mouth, the broad, cap
able brow, was the story of that little,
half-starved Polish girl, who began to
earn her own living when she was
twelve years old by playing dance
music, and has since won her way to
the place of the greatest coloratura
singer of the day.
And the sadness of the long struggle
is there, in the sometime droop of the
;ips, in the drop of the heavy lids that
veil the merriment of the kind, golden
brown eyes, piquantly set not quite
ftraight under their wide brows.
But there is not a thread of gray in
madame's abundant nut-brown hair.
â¢ hardly a wrinkle in her skin fair and
fine â so much for a long course of rose
leaves. And she wore her rich and
â¢simple white silk waist and gray skirt
with all the stateliness of a small queen
and with only perhaps a round five

had man}', pearls at her throat, price
less rings on her hands, I have never
seen more finely, less aggressively

"Make her smile," the photographer
whispered to me then. The native

"Madame," I said, "won't you please

Fan Francisco is to sing inâ I want you
to smile."
"Oh. and then you will photograph
the thought,"* madame laughed instant
ly, turning to me. It was then the
photographer "took" her.

rhaking off the stiffness of posing, "for

automobile. If my husband would

threatening finger at her manager.

Then, there are the cottagesâ not - in
rarer taste are the country seats in old
England, simply planned, with ivy

polo fields and golf links and tennis
courts lying beyond, and In ltis midst a
fine country clubhouse, an elemental
factor In a smart suburban center â
'else how could the men stay on and
on and on. to press a suit involving a
pretty maid and millions! Ah, these
country clubs are fine arenas for love
lists. Many a tale of love has been
unburdened unto willing ears under the
broad verandas of that clubhouseâ the
latest the affair of handsome Paul
Clagstone of Idaho (It's with an awful
wrench that we learn that he is not a
Californian, but it's safe to say he will
' be) and his bonny bride. Miss Cora
Kirk.
Apropos to the wedding of the paif,
no prettier sight could have been con
jured than the whole affair â the ro
mance, the ceremony, gowns, pretty
women, handsome men and such a gay
mobilization of turnouts.
Such luscious fields of quivering
wild oats, splotched with the poppy's
gold and the lupine's blue! Such oaks
â¢with hoary beards, shading the coy
nemophila! Small wonder that the
Hobait eye looked lovingly upon the
emooth. broad countryside, so like the
Kladeg of England, and settled there his
fine menage. Small wonder, too, that
others followed close upon the heels of
the early-comers, and new homes grew
irp from the meadow lands. Fine roads
soon beribboned the country-side, and
behold it now â the home place of the
town -bored smart set.

In Chicago M. Ghio found that most
of the anarchists were Slavs and gave
the doctrine the dignity of religious
belief most adapted to their - mystio
nature.
He says American anarchists now
confine their work to v , passive resist
ance against the governing powers
without violence of any kind. In hl3
opinion the poetical productions of
Walt Whitman have greatly contrib
uted to make the anarchical Idea a
peaceful one in America.
Of Paterson he says that, although
the center of violent anarchism. It has
of late become more quiet. Anarchy
even there Is losing its tragical charac
teristics and making of the New Jersey
town only a center of discussion for
dissatisfied workmen.
PARIS. May 14.â Paul Ghlo. thÂ© noted
sociologist, has Just published a book
entitled "A Journey Through the Land
of Anarchism," in which he gives the
result of his studies in thÂ© United
States and his impressions of New
York, Patereon, N. J.. and Chicago as
the most prominent seats of anarchism.
He says the principal complaint of
anarchists against state authority in
America is the result of the absorption
of the individual liberty of citizens by
the monopoly of political power In the
â¢hands of a few individuals. The ex
istence of trusts with the consequent
increased cost of living is given as one
of the principal grievances of the an
archists against social conditions in
the United States.

- ly toward the setting: of California's

Â¦truth. Xo straining of facts, no ex

that California has a superiority that

A SYNDICATE PROJECT.
The first fruit has been plucked
from California's tree of enterprise.
As 'a result of her exhibit here two
of St. Louis* wealthiest business men,
a banker and a merchant, are now on
their way to the Golden State in the
interest of a syndicate formed for the
purpose of developing land for settlers.
This syndicate wants tracts of the land
on which grows the fruit and other
products shown here, especially' tokay
grapes. It intends buying a small
piece first â small for a syndicate â and
experimenting with this. -The .agents
are instructed to secure 640 acres.
The confident . Californians " say there
will be no doubt of the result of the
experiment.
Judge Wills and Dr. Green of the
Sacramento Development Association
achieved this first important result.
They were introduced to a' member of
the syndicate among "the many other
men of weatlh and enterprise they are
making a business of ; meeting- here
and he Bald: "You are the very men
we want to see; we want to get posted
on California land." The Sacramento
representatives showed him Califor
nia's fruits, vegetables and . cereals
and the tokay. grape exhibit and the
story of the profits derived from that
grape impressed him the most. jÂ» So
the first experiment made by the
syndicate will be with tokay grapes
and some day the rich city of St. Louis
will have brought directly to it in a
manner that will leave no doubt In any
mind the whole wonderful story of
thÂ» tokay in California.
"Go and see that wonderful fruit
show made by, California," is becom
ing a common piece 'of advice.

The cruiser New Orleans is at Chefu

danger threatening Newchwang from
hordes of bandits who were awaiting
the departure of the Russians to begin
depredations, it was deemed advisable
to protect American and other foreign
interests there until the Japanese ar
rived. A cruiser and gunboat were ac
cordingly ordered to- Chefu to hold
themselves in readiness for service at
Newchwang, the gunboat to be util

is a strong probability of peace through
the war party urging the Czar to end
the trouble. -It is pointed out in seri
ous political circles, knowing the view
of the Foreign Office, that the time is
not yet ripe for peace efforts. ,The Ger
man Government is aware that strong
currents in France and Great Britain
are working for peace and that even
political Influences in Russia itself are
moving in the same direction. It Is
admitted here that these efforts would
be materially strengthened If the Rus

advance at Mukden.

CHEFU. May 15, noon.â The United
States cruiser New Orleans, with Rear
Admiral Stirling on board, arrived to
day from Shanghai. Her orders were
simply to come to Chefu. Rear Admi
ral Stirling said that the reason for his
coming and his future movements are
unknown to, him. In view of the pre
vious order that no ships should come
north of Shanghai, the movement of
the New Orleans is considered signifi
cant here. One interpretation of the
arrival of the cruiser is that the United
States 'will Insist upon the neutrality
of Newchwang when the Russians

TOKIO, May 14, 3 p. m.. â A corres
pondent of the Komumin Shimbun of
Tokio who was with General Kuroki
has made the charge that the Russians
mutilated Japanese dead at the Yalu
River.
He says that when the detachment
of the Fourth Regiment of the Impe
rial Guards, which occupied Kasan, re
ceived the counter attack from the
Russians three Japanese soldiers fell
into the hands of enemy and were taken
prisoners. The mutilated corpse of one
of them, named Tatsujiro Watanabe,
was afterward found, according to the
correspondent, hanging to a tree on the
bank of the Yalu. "The dead i man's
face had been stripped of its skin,'*
continues the correspondent, "and his
feet had been cut. The mutilations were,
horrible. It is believed that the other
two men met the same fate, but that
when the corpses of the three were
rolled over the bank only that of Wat
anabe caught on a tree, the others fall
. Ing into the river."
The publication of these charges
has caused Intense indignation.

PARIS, May 14.-^The Foreign Of
fice here is without additional details
of the widespread devastation wrought
by Turkish troops in the Sassoun dis
trict of Armenia. The French press
advices giving the number of killed as
100 on each side arc considered to be
far short of showing the magnitude
of the affair. The burned villages oc
cupied the most inaccessible portion
of the empire and officials here say it
probably will be Impossible to secure
details before a month has passed.
The scene of the affair is in a valley
surrounded by mountains. The natives
have been constantly agitating against
Turkey. The Sultan therefore wished
to exterminate this disorderly element,
but while not countenancing Armenian
agitation, the signatories of the Ber
lin treaty have strongly disapproved of
Turkey's methods in crushing agita
tion.
It is the belief in official circles that
the international Armenians will use
the new outrages as a lever to induce
the civilized powers to unite in deci
sive action against Turkey.

our sentries, who reported that the
enemy had not appeared. The loco
motive steamed on quickly, without
encountering any sign of life, as far

With nightfall from the hills outlined
against the blaze of . flre, shots were
heard occasionally. The locomotives
showed no signs of starting. . Chinese
approached us. with complaints against
the Governor, who had executed eight
more of our friends. The Chinese
frightened, huddled around our camp

daybreak a monster ammunition train,
drawn by several engines, arrived. It
was essential to take that train
through to Port Arthur, an exception
ally dangerous undertaking in view of
the reappearance of the enemy. Two
squadrons of "frontier guards were
sent out to reconnoiter the neighbor

Lieutenant von Roop, two armed

signal the train, which was following

PARIS, May 14.â French confidence
in Russian prowess is much shaken as
a result of the recent developments
concerning the weakness of General
Kuropatkin's land forces. The early
Japanese successes were accepted as
merely preliminary, it being believed
by the officials and public here gen
erally that Kuropatkin was concentrat
ing a vast force, approximately 400,000
men, which eventually would annihi
late the smaller Japanese army. The
military experts of the Figaro and
other leading papers have sought to
demonstrate that Kuropatkin's success
was a "mathematical certainty on the
ground that his forces was four times
greater than that of the Japanese. But
reports of the last . ten days have
shown a constant shrinkage of Kuro
patkin's army until now. it is generally
accepted In official circles that he has
not over 200,000 men/ including those
locked up at Port Arthur and other
garrisons. The announcement that the
Russian commander has put off taking
the offensive until July in order to se
cure reinforcements adds to the
belief that his strength has heretofore
been greatly overestimated. However,
the officials and the public generally
continue to believe that Kuropatkin is
working a strategic plan, attracting the
Japanese far . inland, where ultimately I
he will overwhelm them. : The feelin*

The correspondent in St: Petersburg

officer's resume of the- situation . in the
Far East; as follows:
"The Japanese are advancing: toward
the â¢ Russian positions along, three
routes. Kurokl's army is marching up
on the Liaoyang from Fengwangcheng;

PARIS, May. 15. --The Journal's St-
Petersburg correspondent telegraphs
that he has had an interview, with an
intimate friend of War Minister Sak
haroff, who declares that It was im
possible that serious fighting could oc
cur within five days, the Japanese
forces being separated by a distance of
one hundred miles from General Kuro
patkin's main army. Mobilization, the
correspondent says. Is causing serious
distress in Siberia, in some provinces
It being absolutely impossible to con
tinue agricultural work.
Mobilization of. Russian Troops Inter
feres With Agricultural Work.
Official advices received here to-day
say. there is an enormous congestion of
military forces near 'Irkutsk, Siberia,
owing to the inability of the troops to
cross Lake Baikal, the floating Ice still
preventing the passage of the j boats
and a detour round the foot of the lake
requiring seven days. Therefore a
large force Is held bac^c until it is pos
sible to cross the lake. It is the belief
here that these troops may sufficiently
augment General Kuropatkln's
strength to permit him to take the of
fensive.
DISTRESS IN SIBERIA.
General Brugere, head of the French
army, called recently on General Por
ter, the United States Embassador, and
the two veterans went over the Man
churian campaign from the standpoint
of French and American njilitary men.
They agreed v that much would depend
upon the topbgraphy of the country
between Mukden and. Harbin, owing
to the part artillery will play In com
manding the passage of rocky defiles.
During- the discuss'ion it was suggested
that a Russian campaign somewhat
similar to General Lee's campaign in
Virginia probably would be the most
effective means of stopping the Jap
anese advance.
of confidence, however, is steadily
diminishing..
that the Russian cause is lost, one In
timating that Russia will prefer to
make an attempt to recover her pres
tige in another sphere â evidently
meaning Southern Asiaâ rather than to
continue the struggle in Manchuria in
definitely. This change of- tone per
vades not only the military criticisms,
but the political leaders as well. The
National Zeitung, which is regarded as
the principal organ of the Foreign Of
fice, predicts that China will side with
Japan as soon as Port Arthur falls and
characterizes the Russian attempt to
hold Manchuria as equally rash in con
ception and defective In execution.
The suggestion of a St. Petersburg
newspaper that it is the duty of the
civilized nations to threaten China with
an army of occupation if she shows in
dications of taking sides is treated as
puerile. The powers have allowed Rus
sia to have her own way in Manchuria
merely because they were disinclined
to re-enter upon Chinese adventures.
WASHINGTON. May 14.â Minister
Conger reports by cable to the State
Department from Peking that the Chi
nese Government has reiterated its de
termination to observe the strictest
neutrality and has asserted Its ability
to do so. In view of the leading part
taken by the United States Govern
ment in securing the International
pledge of the neutralization of China,
the State Department has felt deep
concern in the reports of agitation
among the Chinese military forces
near the seat of war and the danger
of their violating neutrality, thus re
leasing the powers from the engage
ment into which they entered. Mr.
Conger is keeping the Department
closely advised of the situation in
China and his news IS received with
satisfaction here.
while it is admitted here that a Chi
nese outbreak will be a new source of
danger, preparations have been per
fected by General Kuropatkin to in
sure the protection of this artery,
which is vital to the supply of his
army. It is a matter of satisfaction to
the authorities that the Koreans are
proving more friendly than the Chi
nese, as is shown by the reports of
the destruction by them of the tele
graph wires used by the Japanese in
Xorthern Korea.
CHEFU, May 14.â Admiral Katzo
ka's fleet, the third Japanese squadron,
began a fierce bombardment of tfy? de
fenses of Dalny this morning. The
land batteries were speedily silenced.
Russian troops were again seen in
the neighborhood and driven out of
their positions by shells. Under cover
of the flre from the ships, the troops
â¢were landed and a combined attack
on the city was undertaken. There is
<*ver>- indication, that the town is now
in the possession of the Japanese.
"When the dispatch boat Fawn ar
rived off Dalny early this morning a
heavy bombardment was in progress.
As the channel was thickly mined by
the Russians, and the Japanese ad
â¢ miral, Kataoka. had issued strict or
ders that non-combatant boats were
to be excluded, it was impossible to
get within the roadstead. Hence, an
accurate report of the proceedings is
impossible As far as it wts possible
to ascertain the armored cruiser Ha
kurr -v four other cruisers, one gun
boat and on- battleship, having cleared
the channel, entered the harbor short
ly after daylight and bogan a heavy
fire i :.:rh was stlH in progress at noon.
It is estimated that 2f>,000 Japanese
troops are investing the town and there
!b ever}' reason to believe that they
delivered the assault this afternoon and
art now in possession of the city
It is understood that the landing of
the second army was completed yes
terday at Pitzewo. There are now 50 -
000 Japanese troops on the peninsula. '

May 1 5, via Seoul May 14.â The Rus
sians who retreated after the battle of
. May 1 are fortifying Kaoliman. Strong
ST. PETERSBURG. May 14.âDis
quieting news regarding the attitude
of the Chinese is shown in dispatches
from c-fficers at the front, issued by the
general staff to-night. In addition to
the further details of the cutting oft
of Port Arthur and confirming the re
port of the Japanese advance upon
Liaoyang, these dispatches state spe
cifically that the Chinese have com
menced hostilities against the Rus
sians.
Major General Karevltch reports that
the Chinese attacked his outposts on
the Fengwangcheng road leading to
Saimatsi. General Pflug telegraphs
that according to reports of patrols and
missionaries the Chinese, at Tapad
ziatsi, 160 miles northwest of Mukden
and just outside the Russian sphere of
influence, are preparing to rise against
the Russians and Christians generally.
As showing the extent of the hostile
attitude of the Chinese attention is
particularly called to the fact that the
distance in an air line from that point
where the Russian outposts were at
tacked and Tapadziatsi . is 200 . miles.
The authorities say that this matter
affects not only Russia but the whole
civilized world, as it is feared the ris
ing will spread to other parts of the
empire.
The hostile attitude of the Chinese
is attributed to the action of the Japan
ese In spreading reports of their suc
cesses and magnifying their victories
at Port Arthur and on the Yalu. This
propaganda â¢ has been active recently
in all parts of China. ' ;
Â£o far as the railway is concerned,

Made on Russians.
CHINESE ARE HOSTILE.
reinforcements from Fengwangcheng
joined them. Their positions are good
and the next fight is expected to take
place there. The enemy has built earth
works on the hills north and south of
the village and have many pieces of
artillery. The country about Kaoliman
is very mountainous and steep. Al
most unscalable mountains protect the
enemy's rightflank. There are no Rus
sians between Kaoliman and Sed'j on
the southern Ai River, on the north.
In retreating, the Russians burned
their buildings and supplies and de
vastated the country, so that the Jap
anese should not find support.
Two Russian detachments, while re
treating, had an engagement at Tan
shangcheng, east of Hamaton, in the
darkness on Sunday night, one mistak
ing the other for Japanese. The re
sult was that 110 Russians were killed
and thirty wounded. The first party
was entrenched on a' hill and mistook
the other for approaching Japanese.
The story was obtained by a Japan
ese patrol from the inhabitants of
neighboring villages, and is supported
by the fact that there are many fresh
graves in the vicinity.

locality of the fight is not given, but
probably was in the Sassoun district
of Armenia.

of the most enthusiastic ' of the class
members and oh' several â¢ occasions at
his Oakland home he has entertained
his college mates. â¢ \ This being the
quarter century. anniversary, the Gov

observance take place at the executive

members were present, ' having .come
from all parts of the State and in two

executive mansion is of ' goodly size,
but the man who designed It never
counted on accommodating it to the
needs of sixty or more guesta.
So for days furniture dealers have
been bringing in extra- bedding and
the Gdvernor has been. obliged-. to pre

beautifully and that all he feaTed waa

one instance the wife brought her hus

being a member of {he class, while her

down to a splendid dinner to-night in

Narrow Escape From Death.
Collins Writes to Kerrigan.
Attorney George D. Collins thinks
that Presiding Judge F. H. Kerrigan
has DO right to assign to a Judge of
the Superior Court a case ln which an
order has been issued by a Judge other
than the one to whom the case has
bc-en assigned. In a letter received
by Judge Kerrigan from Collins yes
terday the attorney takes exception to
the presiding Judge's assignment of
the proceedings instituted by him to
prevent the arrest of Inmates of the'
Hotel Marscano at 1129 Dupont street
to Judge Sloss. He -says the case
should have been assigned to Judge
The court reduced McGlH's claim for
pay as guardian from $350 to $175
and cut his claim for lesal services
from $150 to $50. Judge Kerrigan
also refused to allow McGill more than
$50 to recompense him for an alleged
advance of $425 made by him to the
incompetent.

munity and handling the mall of large
corporations. It has more than paid
for itself and the receipts, have been
greater than those of many first-class
postofflces. The inability to keep trust
worthy carriers at the rate fixed by
lawâ $50 a monthâ is the reason given
by the department for its action.

OPPOSES THE REBUILDING
OF THE EL CAMINO REAL
San Jose Grange Does Not Believe the
State Should Bear the Burden
of Exj>enÂ«e.
SAN JOSE. Mar 14.â The San Jose
Grange is opposed to the building of
the El Camlno Real at State expense.
At the meeting of the grange this
morning the construction of the road
way was discussed. It was the sense
of the meeting that as the proposition
of rebuilding the road sprang from
purely sentimental motives, and that
it would be of no practical benefit for
freight, as it paralleled both the rail
road and the ocean, the expense would
not be warranted. It was contended
that the people of the counties out
side the territory of the road would
not vote for 'the proposition without
they could get appropriations for
roads and highways within their own
counties, and as a consequence the tax
upon the people of the State for road
ways would become too heavy a burden
to bear.
LOS ANGELES, May 14.â The Meth
odist General Conference to-day per
formed one of its delicate as well as ita
most painful duties. It retired from all
active participation in church work five
of its venerable Bishops. They are
Bishop Edward G. Andrews _ of New
York, Bishop John M. Walden of Cin
cinnati, Bishop John H. Vincent of Zu
rich, Switzerland; Bishop Willard F.
Mallalieu of Boston and Bishop Cyrus
D. Foss of Philadelphia. - â¢
The ballot on the retirement of these
high officials was taken at noon to-day,
and "while the result is closely guarded
and will not be made public until the
tellers report to the conference next
Monday morning, it can be stated with
every assurance of accuracy that those
above named will be placed on the
superannuated roll. The committee on
episcopacy, whose duty It was to con
sider, this Important matter and make
recommendations to the General Con
ference, did not include the ' name of
Bishop Foss among those to be retired.
It stated, however, that the question of
retiring Bishop Foss had been consid
ered bv the committee and that, after
hearing a statement by that officer It
had been decided to continue hia name
in the effective list. It wat thought
that this explanation would result In
Bishop Foss' retention as an active
general superintendent, but It is learned
from reliable sources that the vote In
favor of Bishop Foss' retirement was
more than two-thirds of the accredited
representation to the conference. The
vote on the other Bishops ranged from
500 to 600 In favor of retirement. The
conference also accepted the request of
senior Bishop Stephen M. Merrill for
retirement.
DRAMATIC SCENE PRESENTED.
The action of the conference to-day
creates six vacancies In the Board of
Bishops. Tlrese. together with the two
resulting by reason of the deaths of
Bishops Ninde and Hurst during the
last quadrennlum, makes necessary the
election of eight general superintend
ents by the present conference. It Is
also probable that two additional mis
sionary Bishops will be chosen.
The scene that preceded the ballot
ing upon the retirement of the aged
Bishops was dramatic. At the mo
ment when every one expected the
conference to adjourn for the day, in
order to permit the delegates to ac
cept an invitation to go sightseeing,
Dr. J. M. Buckley, chairman of the
committee on episcopacy, arose and
asked permission to submit the report
from a committee on the subject of
superannuated Bishops. There were
Immediate manifestations of surprise
among the delegates and for the time
being all thoughts of adjournment
were abandoned. Dr. Buckley made
his way to the platform amid intense
silence. Facing the assembly, ,he
paused a moment and said slowly, and
impressively:
"A man in my position at this mo
ment is to be pitied, but I am only
doing my duty." Â¦. Â¦
He. then proceeded to read the re
port of the sub-committee of the com
mittee on episcopacy, recommending
the retirement of Bishops Walden,
Mallalleu, Vincent and Andrews, amid
the closest attention.
BISHOPS ARE RETIRED.
"The report of the sub-committee of
the standing committee on episcopacy
having recommended the placing of^
Bishops Willard F. Mallalieu. John M.'
Walden, John II. Vincent And Edward
G. Andrews on the superannuate list,
before taking action or engaging in
discussion, a committee was appointed
to confer with those Bishops and to
invite them to communicate their
views in person to the committee. This
they did at such length anfl In such
manner as they'thought best.
"During the discussion which sub
sequently ensued the condition and
prospects of Bishop Cyrus D." Foss
were taken into consideration and the
committee took a tentative vote' upon
his retirement and invited him to a
special session, held for the purpose.
He appeared and made the communi
cation requested. The committee after
four hours Â»of consideration, in which
more than fifty of the members took
part, giving information from all parts
of the work at home and abroad, pro
ceeded to vote by ballot upon the
question of effectiveness of the Bish
ops whose names are mentioned in
this report. .The. result was that the
committee recommended that they be
placed upon a superannuate list, to
take effect at the close of his General
Conference, and Instructed the chair
man to move that they be so classi
fied." .- â¢ >
Dr. Buckley then read a further re
port of I the committee , on episcopacy
reporting as effective the following
Bishops:
Â¦John W. Hamilton/David H. Moore,
Earl Cranston, Charles C. McCabe,
Daniel A. Goodsell, Isaac W. Joyce,
James M. Fitzgerald, Charles H. Fow
ler and Henry W. Warren, and the fol
lowing, missionary Bishops effective:
Francis W. Warne, Joseph C. Hartzell
and James M. Thoburne.
PARLIAMENTARY OBSTRUCTION.
Upon the conclusion of tke reading
of the report Dr. Buckley asked for
Immediate action -by the conference.
A motion to adjourn was promptly
voted down. Motions to lay the report
on the table, to extend the time to
allow a ballot to be taken and a fur
ther motion to lay the motions upon
the table* were successively voted upon
by the conference, and, notwithstand
ing the injecting of every other par
liamentary -obstruction, the way was
finally cleared and Dr. Buckley was
given the floor.
"Am I awoke this morninr, "he be
gan, "long before daylight, after hav
ing retired at 2 o'clock, two passages
of the Scriptures came into my mind,
as if they had /"been sent there. The
first waa from the Old Testament: The
days of our years are three score years
and ten, and If .by reason of strength
they be four score years, yet Is there
strength, labor and sorrow.' And. the
other was from the New Testament:
'He must increase, but I must de
crease.' â¢
"It has been Intimated this morning
that this matter was progressing un
der a species of gag law. .
"Mr. President, the committee, on
episcopacy consists of 256 members;
men selected by the laity and the min
istry of their conferences. When the
vote was taken upon the report of the
sub-committee, which recommended
the retirement of Bishops Walden,
Mallalleu, Vincent and Andrews, a
tentative vote was then taken upon
the vote q,f Bishop Foss. Two hun
dred and twenty-four members of the
committee were present and the small
est vote relating to the superannuation
of these beloved men canie within two
of being twQ/Â»thirds of t'ke whole num
ber and several of the votes passed the
three-quarters mark. In all the de
bate there was not an unkind word;
in all the debate no controverted sub
ject was introduced, nor was there
anything said which could not have
been said if the subject of it had been
present.
"This is the situation: If the episco
pacy of our church can be managed
with, all of its diverse and complicated
duties by men averaging above 70
years, and the majority of them aver
aging a higher rate, and If these per
sons take a contract of four ' years,
then the episcopacy cannot possibly be
so .important as it is generally supposed
to be.
DICTUM OF A BISHOP.
"Brethren, the destiny of the young
preacher, the destiny of the old preach
er, turns upon the dictum of a Bishop.
The memory is the first great faculty
to begin to fail. A man may stand and
preach like an angel at 85, but he can
not take on new matter and do any
thing of a serious character requiring
the memory at 85, unless he be a prod
igy, and legislative bodies do not leg
islate upon the principle of prodigies,
but upon the great average of human
nature. It has been said that the man
who talks about retiring a Bishop is a
cruel man. I have never talked about
it. All that I am doing to-day I do
under orders. To no man on the com
mittee did I ever name the men to be
retired. With no member of any com
mittee that I have appointed have I
conversed during the entire session in
connection with the matters that . are
described in this report. "Wherever I
knew that anything had been said that
I could clear up in favor of a- Bishop,
I spoke to the committie about it. That
is all that I have done!
"Let me say there is no Bishop in
this assembly, there has been no Bish
op in this assembly since James and
Ames died, that I have not had the
honor and pleasure of voting for. These
men are among my best friends. They
have been my advisers. The General
Conference officers, my brothren, are
never superannuated. They are simply
left out. If you want to get rid of them
vftte for some other men. Not so with
persons who hold a life estate. There
fore when a BishoD reaches a point
when he is too feble, then wisdom and
the. best interests of the church demand
that he be retired.
"The circumstances now apply. Ami
if you do not retire these Bishops :it
this conference you will not retire
them at any future conference, and
you will have aged men in all the
centers of church activity. Having
failed to take action at this time,' you
will at future conferences fall 'back
on that plea of the weak and the se!f
defensive â the time limit."
BISHOP FOSS INTERRUPTS.
At this point Dr. Buckley was Â«n
terrupted by Bishop Foss, who rose
from his seat on the stage and asked
whether the conference .would grant
him. permission to put a question pri
vately : to Dr. Buckley. There were
cries from the floor of "Let it be
granted/' vBlshop Foss rose; from his
chair on the stage and coming to the
edge of the platform, whispered a mo
ment with. Dr. Buckley, who had al
ready replied that he would gladly
listen to the question . if the , confer
ence were willing. | The white-haired
Bishop and Dr. Buckley stood and
whispered together inaudlbly while
the great assembly watched in abso
lute, silence. It was- a dramatic mo
ment. ' ...- . . . .-;Â¦-* Â¦ - . -;*',',':,!.i':: Â¦

A curious thing about the discovery
is that it was due more or less to an
accident. Mr. Allen had some horses in
his establishment which were suffering
from carbolic poisoning, and he asked
for oil to be applied as an antidote.
It was only when the effects were
found to be so unexpectedly success
ful that it was discovered that It was
turpentine that had been administered.
A few days after a blacksmith who
was unconscious from the effects of
carbolic poisoning was treated similar
ly, with satisfactory results.
Recently a well-known chemical ex
pert in Dublin tested the efficacy of the
antidote on a dog. A dose of carbolic
acid was first administered, and when
all the ordinary symptoms of carbolic
poisoning had been developed, oil of
turpentine was applied, and the dog
recovered within a short time.

Mrs. Kate Amelia Briggs, wife of
Arthur R. Briggs, died in this city
last Wednesday evening:. She was a
woman of genial temperament and of
acute and penetrating intellect. This
had been assiduously cultivated, owing
to persistent ill health, which for a
long period kept her in her hotel,
when* reading- and reflection were
largely her solace. Her mental charms
were known to a comparatively small
circle. Her traits have been likened
by discriminating fripnds to those of
Elizabeth Barrett Browning. While
Mrs.. Briggs' literary gifts did not flnd
expression in verse, those who were
favored with her corraspondence saw
in It evidence of familiarity with and
assimilation of . the thoughts of the
best writers. Tb,is>- was particularly
true of Emerson, of whom she was a
close student and an ardent admirer.
' Of a kind and charitable disposition,
Mrs. Briggs made it her duty and
pleasure, as far as her health and
means would permit, to care for many
to whom fortune % had proved unkind.
Grief is felt by many because of her
dedth.

OR6VILLE, May 14.â A number of
mining men visited Oroville to-day and
were escorted through the dredging
district by representatives of the vari
ous companies operating here. A drive
was taken down the easterly side of
the Feather River, the party going
aboard the dredge Lava Beds No. 2.
Luncheon was had at the dining-room
of the Feather River Exploration Co.
on the west side of the river and the
afternoon was spent in investigating
conditions there. A dinner was tendered
the party at the Union Hotel to-night.
Former Senator A. F. Jones acted as
toastmaster. Among the party are
Senator Charles Belshaw, president of
the California Miners' Association; H.
P.. Stow, vice president, and E. H. Ben
jamin, secretary of the association;
Senator Ralston, former Attorney Gen
eral Tlrey L. Ford, H. H. Yard, W. H.
Rice, E. C. Voorhees, Colonel Heuer of
the United States Debris Commission,
C. G. Yale, statistician for the United
States Mint, and F. E. Dunlap, expert
for the State Board of Examiners.
The object of the visit was to deter
mine whether or not the charges of
damage to farming: lands along the
river bottoms of the Feather River
were well founded. The dredging men
claim that the river channel is helped
rather than Injured by the dredging
operations along the river. The large
boulders and well washed gravel are
deposited on top of the sand, which
goes through the machine and less ma
terial Is washed from the banks by
floods on ground that has been mined
than from that which has not been
mined.

SAN QUENTIN. May 14;â All of the
members of the State Board of Prison
Directors attended the meeting at San
Quentin to-day. The session was un
usually long as there was much busi
ness to be transacted. The matter of
granting: paroles occupied much of the
time of the meeting. No paroles had
been granted for many months and
there are sixty-four prisoners whose
papers are complete anG on file. Many
applicants have become disheartened
and have what Is known as "parole
fever." They are utterly discouraged
and in some instances nave become
indifferent to prison rules. Warden
Tompkins indicated to me directors
that they should dispose of the applica
tions one way or another.
The session commenced at 10 o'clock
this morning: and before noon adjourn
ment three men were granted parole.
The board reconvened at 1:30 and re
mained in executive session until 6
o'clock. Many other paroles were acted
upon favorably and will be granted at
the next meeting. The expert's report
upon the prison books was entirely
satisfactory to the board. It was found
that $44,169 25 of the prison fund deficit
had been made up by the .sale of jute
bags.
John O'Brien, who stabbed a cell
mate two months ago, had his credits
taken a^Vay. R. Sanchez, who attack
ed a guard some time ago, lost five
years' credits.
Those who were granted paroles are:
George F. Trueworthy, James M.

to take effect at once. Frank Hayes
was granted parole, to take effect July

Court Is Asked to Settle Dispute Over
Standing of the Players as
â¢Union Men.
A suit involving the standing in la-
bor ranks of twelve members of the
Pacific Coast-Musicians' Union, an in
corporated body, was filed yesterday
in the Superior Court. It Is an action
for $1000 damages and an injunction.
The injunction is sought to prevent
Palace Hotel Guest Has Expensive
Experience Upon Landing at
This Side of the Bay.
Harry S. Husted, a business man of
Chicago, arrived here yesterday and
shortly after registering at the Palace
Hotel discovered that his wallet, con
taining $350 in currency and two
drafts, was missing from the inside
pocket of his coat. Husted came out
West ' by way of St. Paul and he
readily recalled yesterday that when
the train was leaving the latter city
a friend pointed out a fellow passen
ger as one of St. Paul's most notori
ous pickpockets. The man from Chi
cago was careful to avoid the alleged
crook from St. Paul during the over
land journey, but on leaving the
Ferry building on this side of the bay
Husted says he noticed his objectional
traveling companion close to him.
Just as he -was leaving the ferry exit
Husted felt himself rudely Jostled, but
paid little heed to the fact. When he
reported his loss to the police they
quickly agreed with him that the man
who had accompanied him overland
knew something about the missing
wallet and Detective Ryan has been
detailed to round up the alleged crook.
It Is the grave cases of a physician
that benefit the undertaker.
the circulation of alleged false re
ports about a picnic to be given to
day. : The San Francisco Labor Coun
cil and the Musicians' Protective As
sociation are asked to pay this sum
for circulating false statements about
the plaintiff, the statements being to
the effect that twelve members of the
organization are not union men and
that therefore the picnic to be given
at El Campo by Alpine and Galileo
gToves of Druids, at which the twelve
men are to play, is a non-union af
fair. The Druids are joined with the
Pacific Coast Musicians' Union as
plaintiffs. --V : f
â¢ The complaint recites that when the
Druids first arranged for their picnic
they secured the. services of A. E.
Fouts and eleven other members of
the plaintiff union. It is alleged that
the defendants, upon learning of this,
caused to be spread broadcast the re
port that the musicians had been
hired for less than union wages and
that therefore they did not constitute
a union band. It is also claimed that
the Labor Council threatens to send
out circulars containing this Informa
tion and before the departure of the
picnic crowd to exhibit banners an
nouncing to the public that the pic
nic music is not being furnished by
the Musicians* Union.
The case was assigned to Judg:
SIobs for trial.
While in the hospital Captain Mc-
Cracken, with the exception of mas
sage to keep his blood circulating,
was not treated as an injured man.
He was simply allowed to rest.
Recently the doctors discovered that
the three fractured ribs had knitted to
gether and were as strong as ever.
Further examination disclosed the fact
that the back had grown stronger
where it was broken.
Finally he gained in strength, and
then it was decided to put off the op
eration. The patient Improved so
rapidly that he was removed from the
hospital to his home about ten days
ago.
WASHINGTON, May 14. â Captain
James McCracken, more than 70 years
old, of this city, has recovered from a
broken back, three fractured ribs and
other internal Injuries without a sur
gical operation, and his case is the
talk of physicians here. Captain Mc-
Cracken simply relied upon nature to
repair damage.
â¢ On account of his advanced age his
recovery has attracted more than local
attention. Captain McCracken met
with an accident on February 15, while
endeavoring to board a streetcar. He
was caught between two cars and re
ceived injuries so serious that physi
cians who examined him believed they
wouM prove fatal. For many days
after his removal to the Emergency
Hospital Captain McCracken's physi
cians held out no hope for recovery.
Ills Injuries were sufficiently serioua^to
cause death In nine cases out of ten,
and the doctors believed the patient's
advanced age would count him with
the majority. For weeks his life hung
by a thread, and the doctors were
afraid to operate because of his en
feebled condition.

The Beer That Made Milwaukee I^istiou^
"Farts are facts and stubborn things
indeed," says a Michigan clergyman
who had a memorable food experience.
â¢ "The fact is when a man gets all out
â¢*f Forts physically because of a de-
rangement of the stomach, so that his
heart action is bad, is very nervous
owing to physical organs Impaired and
nothing: he can eat of an ordinary kind
'vfill properly assimilate, it is time to
call a halt. Such was my case two
years ago last March, when I com-
menced using Grape-Nuts according to
directions, and have continued their
use up to the present time with the
result I am in better health physically
and mentally than I have been for
many years, having passed by sixty-
third year.
"To demonstrate this fact, I proposed
a footrace with my 11-year-old boy,
who was very fleet on foot and, he
t'^ic^ barefoot, imagined he could out-
-un'his pa, but I was besting him until
a Flip of my foot on a muddy place
- aueed me to stumble, and I found my-
eclf rolling in the mud in the road. I
soon found my footing again, undam-
&ged. and had to join in a good, hearty
laugh with my wife and daughter.
"Why should I not recommend
Orape-Nuts to my friends when the
food has done bo much for me, for I
â¢am confident that had It not been for
the help this excellent food supplied I
v.ould to-day have been past recovery.
Instead of growing .old now I feel
younger than I have for years, with
more mental strength as well as phy-
sical, and can preach better sermons
than ever before." Name given by
Postum Co.. Battle Creek. Mich.
O rape-Nuts makes far healthier,
keener brains. A dull, worn out brain
can be remade on this food. There's a
reason-

"Good morning, Lottie," was the

Mogan. "Why, may I ask, did you de
lay your visit until I was compelled
to send for you? Nervous prostration,
I suppose?"
"No, indeed," responded Miss Gon

toms of settling down for a real com

Minna street, between Fifth and
Sixth, was rudely disturbed at 2 o'clock
yesterday morning by an alternation
between Charles Crosett and his wife,
in whese veins apparently courses the
blood of a people whose being on this
continent antedated the landing of Col
umbus. The policeman who stopped
the brawl and gave the neighbors a
chance to renew slumber found in the
husband's pocket a loaded revolver and
it was on a charge of carrying con
cealed weapons that the latter stood
before Judge Mogan. The wife was
there, too, restraining by force two
bright and pretty children, who
wagged pudgy , hands in greeting to
the father in lieu of being permitted to
Join him In the dock.
"It was just a little 'argument,
Judge," pleaded the prisoner. Then,
turning to his wife, he appealed,
"Wasn't it. dear?"
"It was, dear," responded the little
woman. Then she informed the court
that no shooting was Intended by her
spouse, who had acquired the pistol
carrying habit while campaigning for
his country In the Philippines and was
unable to shake it off Â»hen he re
-turned home. "Him shoxrt me?" she
exclaimed, indignantly. "Why, he'd
as soon think of shooting one of the
children!"
"Go home, you folk, go home," said
the Judge, "and the next time you de
sire to engage in a little argument go
out to the ocean beach or some other
isolated spot where Morpheus is not
doing business."
"Annie .Grafter!" shouted the bailiff
of Judge Fritz's tribunal, and the

who stepped out of the cage In re
sponse to the summons certainly look
ed as if she were not burdened with
a misnomer. Drunkenness and dis
turbing the peace were charged against
her and the Judge gave her ten days.
"Not at human targets, I hope?" re
marked the Judge, glancing at Mr.
Yelminl's face, which was indicative
of anything but a truculent nature.
"No, sir; never shot at man, woman
or child in my life, and I've fired thou
sands of bullets," was the earnestly
delivered answer. "Why, I spend an
average of $15 a month in the shooting
galleries and would blow in more mon
ey if I could afford to."
"Dear me," said his Honor; "there's
no accounting for the vagaries of hu
man extravagance. Some folk drown
their surplus cash while you burn
yours. But you must not allow indul
gence of your penchant to imperil life
and limb in Golden Gate Park. I'll

"I'm a regular fiend for pistol shoot

to. explain his reasons for discharging
a revolver on the south ~ driveway of

It developed before Judge Mogan that
Ella Beattie, arrested last Sunday
morning for recklessly firing three pis
tol shots from the window of her apart
ment at Ellis and Mason'' streets, has
twice been an inmate of an asylum for
insane persons and that she is subject
to occasional recurrence of lunacy. On
this ground her attorney asked that
she be dismissed, but the Judge opined
that the point was not well taken.
"But at the time of the shooting her
mind was as 'rational' as yours or
mine," argued the pleader.
"Then if she^ was mentally responsi
ble for her action she merits imprison
ment," was the rejoinder, "and if she
was of unsound mind she should be
confined to an asylum. By this time
next Tuesday I may be able to decide
what to do with her."
The woman confessed that she was
twice incarcerated for lunacy, and
stated that her uncle, a Mr. Reynolds

by assuming guardianship of her. For

an immoral life in this city.

"You might as well send him to jail,"

no benefit to the children and me."
"But if you send me to jail what'Jl

fendant, whose face and manner fully
bore out. his wife's accusation of con
firmed sottishness.
"You seem to care more for the com
fort of your horses than for that of thia

said the Judge. "However, I will post

For stealing a portion of the lot num

Fletcher was fined $10 by Judge Ca
banlss.
The complaining witness was H. H.
Earle, owner of the pilfered Realty, and
he testified that the defendant, who is
an employe of McEwen Brothers, team
sters, deliberately did carry away two
cartloads of choice loam from his prop
erty and deposit the same in the yard
of a public school, where it was imme
diately utilized for the cultivation of
flowers. When the complainant pro
tested against the defendant's action he
was sworn at and called hard namea Ly
that person.
Then arose a legal squabble over the
propriety of having the defendant ao
cused of petty larceny, which applies
only to personal property, whereas it
was real property that was carted
away. A precedent-establishing conten
tion was abruptly nipped by the court
ordering that a complaint for trespass
be substituted. That was done and con
viction quickly ensued.
Jacob Ulmer, an aged capitalist, was
charged with battery on John Cook,
aged 10 years,, who informed Judge Ca
baniss that the defendant had struck
him upon the head with a heavy cane
and that the assault, which took place
Friday afternoon on Larkin street, had
not been provoked by him in any way.
The defense was that Mr. Ulmer had
been assailed by some young hoodlums
and injured so severely that he did not
know what he was doing when his cane
collided with Master Cook's cranium.
The case was continued till next Tues
day to afford the defense opportunity
to bring in testimony.

"What, both of them?" asked the
Judge.
"Suah, mally 'em bo' â mally 'em lite
'way." ">
Policemen Brown and Holmes hinted
that the women were leading immoral
lives and that Chin derived pecuniary
profit from their shame, but this the
defendant indignantly denied. "They
glood gels," he protested; "I makee 'em
my wlfee." â¢
"I must search the statutes," said
the court, "to find a penalty for this
specific offense. If the case is without
precedent I may sentence the defend
ant and his fiancees to six months in
Utah."
Alejandro Luna did not seem to relish
the idea of making Carmen Parrott
his wife until Judge Mogan explained
the urgency and the justice of N such a
step and incidentally hinted that re
fusal to take It would be accepted as
equivalent to a request to be sent to
jail for as long a period as the law
permitted. Then the young fellow hung
his towzled head and muttered willing
ness to be enlisted in the army of bene
dicts.
He was accused of betraying the
trust placed in his manhood by pretty
eighteen-year-old Carmen when he
promised to marry her, and it was At
torney Treadwell who brought the hy
meneal negotiations to such a
triumphant climax. After he had dis
posed of his regular calendar the Judge
took the contracting parties to his
chamber and there, in the presence of
half a dozen deeply interested witness
es, made' them one. The girl's black
eyes reflected the joy created in her
soul by the court's enforced salvation
c-f her honor, but Alejandro appeared
to appreciate to full measure of seri
ousness the responsibility he was about
to take upon himself. They were a
good-looking couple as they stood hand
in hand while the words that united
them were being spoken. The girl gaz
ed straight at the top of the boy's head,
which remained bowed throughout the
ceremony. As the formal sentences
were uttered by the Judge they were
translated into Spanish by the ever
ready Treadwell, who fluttered around
the young pair with a solicitude that
was almost paternal. When the final
word was spoken the groom lifted his
head, the bride raised her lips and the
union was sealed with a kiss.
"You may tell these young people,"
said the Judge to the interpreter, "that
although this ceremony has been rath
er short on pomp, it is just as binding
upon them both as if It had been ac
companied by bell-ringing, flower
strewing and all the other trimmings
of an up-to-date church wedding. And
you may inform the groom that I con
sider him a very lucky young fellow
to possess the love of such a pretty
and good girl as he has won and that
I hope. he will cherish her always.
Gentlemen, the performance is over."
Then his Honor started humming the
glorious wedding march from "Lohen
grin," and to its stately measure Mr.
and Mrs. Alejandro Luna went forth
to face the world together. After a
brief honeymoon the groom will re
sume work at his trade of iron molder
and the bride will be glad to receive
friends at 1412 Powell street, the resi
dence of her married sister.

WASHINGTON, May 14.â It Is possi
ble that Great Britain may become in
volved in the threatened clash between
Brazil and Peru. United States Minis
ter Thompson cables the State Depart
ment to-day from Petropdlis that Bra
zilian officers yesterday stopped a
British ship at Manaoas while she was
making her way up the Amaion River,
on the ground that she had aboard 260
cases of ammunition destined for the
Peruvian military forces in the up
river country, the possession of which
is now a subject of dispute between
Brazil and Peru. As there has been
no declaration of war, it is expected
that the British Government will enter
a protest against the stopping of the
ship as illegal.
Some high grade bonds have risen
in price, but the general tone in bonds
has become rather heavy in sympathy
with stocks. United States 3's regis
tered declined % per cent on call dur
ing the week.
The Financier this week says: The
notable features of the official state
ment of the New Ydrk Associated
Banks last week were a new high rec
ord for loans and a decrease in pub
lic deposits, the latter chiefly due to
the surrender of the-"""TjOvernment
bonds, which have been held in the
depository banks since April 2 await
ing the disbursement of the Panama
money. There was a further import
ant decrease in cash holdings follow
ing the heavy loss in the previous
week, as the result of the exports of
gold to Europe during the week.
Loans were increased $7,898,600, part
ly because of corporation borrowings
and of operations incident to the.nego
tiations of the New York City bonds
in the previous week. The Japanese
loan last week probably contributed
Indirectly to the increase in this item.
Specie decreased $12,476,400, repre
senting the average of the withdrawals
of $14,000,000 gold last week and of
the average of the $9,000,000 with
drawn in the previous week for ship
ment to Paris. This $5,000,000 taken
on Friday for export on Saturday
counted for one-sixth of the amount.
Legal tenders were increased $2,055,
100, making the net loss of cash $10,
421,300. General deposits showed a
decrease of $2,097,400, while those of
public funds were reduced $23,184,600
through surrenders to the treasury on
account of the Panama payment. The
reserve requirements against general
deposits were reduced $524,350, de
ducting which from the net loss of
cases as above, left $9,896,850 as the
decrease in. surplus reserve to $12,
827.-250. Computed upon deposits, less
those of $32,912, S00 public funds," the
surplus is $21,055,450. It may be ob
served that the statement was made
on declining averages for cash, the
midweek's shipments of $9,000,000
gold counting for but one-half, while
that of $5,000,000 on Saturday as
above noted, was accounted for in the
statement for only, about one and two
thirds milliqns. The engagements on
May 14 of $10,500,000 for shipment on
Tuesday of the coming week will
count in the averages for the full
amount, causing' the institutions to
start the bank week, including the pre
vious average losses, with an import
ant decrease of gold which will be
only partially offset by the receipt,
through transfer from San Francisco
of $2,500,000. There was a remark
ably" good balance shown by the state
ment considering the movements dur- v
ing the week, the sum of the loss of
cash, less the gain in loans, being only
$425,300 greater than the decrease in
general deposits. Comparisons of
loans show that eix banks gained
$8,000,000. net.
A growing inclination to sell stocks
has been reflected in the week's de
clining'prices. A feeling of doubt and
distrust over the general situation and
outlook of business seems to have
been responsible for the # pressure
rather than any special developments.
The unprecedented volume of gold ex
port movement, however, has proved
rather formidable to the feeling of
assurance with which this influence
has been regarded hitherto. The de
cision to make the canal payment in
Paris involved the prompt withdrawal
of funds from New York for transfer
to Paris and the gold exports for this
purpose are rapidly depleting the New
York reserve.
The United States Steel securities
have played a leading part in the
week's trading with maxked sympa
thetic effect on the whole list.
NEW YORK. May 14. â Prices of
stocks receded for a time to-day and
then recovered partly, closing irreg
ular and generally, lowers than last
night. Acute weakness in the Erie
shares had an unsettling effect and
seemed to be based on the material
decline in earnings compared with last
year. Amalgamated Copper reacted
from yesterday's advance. The gen
eral movement Â¦vras narrow. The evi
dence of support for United States
Steel preferred bad a somewhat reas
suring effect upon sentiment. The
bank statement also failed to show as
large an impairment of the surplus as
was feared, by reason of the unexpect
edly moderate loan expansion. To
day's shipment of (5,000,000 gold does
not figure In the statement at all, nor
does the payment this morning of
$2,191,000 by the sub-treasury on ac
count of the Japanese gold wharved
at San Francisco yesterday. Also ar
rangements already made point to the
shpment on Tuesday of $10,500,000 of
gold and the limits of the gold move
ment do not seem to be yet in sight.
Until Paris relaxes its demand for gold
the movement does not seem likely to
be checked. The allottment of the
Russian loan in Paris may release
funds on a large scale.

000.

DARSON. ProDrletor. Santa Cru*Raising Sponges.
An. interesting investigation now be
ing carried on in Florida by the Bu
reau of Fisheries has for Its object the
discovery and development of meth
ods by which the valuable sheepswool
sponge may be cultivated artificially.
The method which promises the most
satisfactory results is that of using
cuttings. Large sheepswool sponges
are cut into small . pieces, which are
fastened to an Insulated wire fixed In
the water, sb that" the sponges are sup
ported a. few. inches above the bottom.
These small, bits, placed at. close in
tervals along the wire, soon heal and
form an organic attachment to It, and
very soon begin to' grow. \It la too
soon to predict just what the results
will be, , but Â¦ the indications are so far
very_. encouraging,., and it Is believed
A Mornmsen Anecdote.
Our European exchanges' contain
many good â¢ anecdotes concerning the
late Theodore Mornmsen, the great
German historian. They refer chiefly to
his absent-mindedness, which .was one
of this learned man's most conspicuous
failings. On one occasion the profes
sor was engaged in his study in pro
found researches and \ failed to notice
the presence of his ; servant, who an
nounced lunch was ready. :.. The servant
asked if he might 1 bring if in 'to the
professor, and, receiving no reply, laid
the table near his writing desje. lie
turning ten minutes later with some
flsh. the dishonest menial - found the
â¢soup untouched.* Thinking It too good
to spoil, he sat down and finished soup
and flEh. unobserved of the professor.
The remaining courses suffered a- sim
ilar fate. About an hour later Momm
sen looked up from. his work, and, feel-
Ing a A-acuum, proceeded to the kitch
en to ask why luncheon had not- been
served. "But the professor had his
luncheon an hour ago!" expostulated
the.servant. "Dear me!" said the his
torian of Rome; "how could I be so for
getful?" and returned peaceably to his
study.-Leslie'a Weekly.

Our Department of Commerce and Labor .has been

interesting to note how far the opening up of; these
vast tracts of land will: go toward; stopping; that. tide of
emigration. The drain would be of less effect were, ; it
not that those leaving constitute a desirable class,;going
to the agricultural districts to become producers. The
new comers from Europe are to aMargc extent dumped
into our cities to consume rather than to. produce, and
therefore they, have not a- tendency to offset -the loss.

\\ tE get, a twinge instructive in the differences in
\/\/ forms of p government by events abroad. The
' V^V r German Reichstag has, taken up the art battle'
between the impressionist and classical school of painters.
The impressionists complain that they- are excluded from
the.. German art exhibit at' StI Louis by the rules of the
game made- by the Kaiser.' Their woe has been uttered
in the. imperial "Parliament.
Agreat many people, doubtless crude aijd unlearned in
art, regard the impressionists as a school of freaks, who
daub . different colored- paints haphazard on canvas and
leave to the impressions,' the imagination, of" the beholder,
the task of clothing the'result with form and motive.
The impressionist painterjs believed by such to have the
sense -of color only, and-to leave such trifles as drawing
and. perspective -to the Â¦ unimaginative and commonplace
souls who bow down to form.
We by no means wish to excuse the Kaiser for.inter
fering with the paint market by knocking at the impres
sionists.;-Perhaps their work is factor in
developing the, imagination. j That faculty of the mind
won't work afall unless it get a job. 'When the severely
formal and- classic painter puts on canvas a horse it is
recognized, even by the humble pilot of a "squeedge" in
a livery stable, -as ahorse. Therefore he suffers from
atrophy of the imagination and - never rises above" his
."squeedge." '.But when an impressionist hitches up a

WE are in receipt of important information per
regular mail from Lookingglass, Oregon. It
comes in an envelope printed on both sides with
a prospectus of the contents which were behind the
sealed flap. It is the announcement by Mr. James In
man of his candidacy for the Presidency of the United
States upon a platform to be made known later.
Mr. Inman is a cautious man and says that his plat
form will be kept from view until the other parties, in
cluding the Prohibitionists, have announced theirs, when
he will spring it upon the country and. proceed to besom
things. The only glimpse of it at present permitted is
his statement that "it will be an evolution out of the old
rut as it were." We think that fill a long-felt want.
He is frankly verbose about what this platform will do
when it gets in its work, for it is to make this country a
"white-winged messenger of peace and life." That is
what we want, onty we insist on some guarantee that
when it gets wings it shall not fly away. Mr. Inman is
convinced that with white wings the country will give
everybody "a dinner, home, clothes and a bed."
This poultry idea of government is original. It is in
teresting. We take it to mean that the country, when
duly winged and feathered, is to lay eggs for the people.
After exploiting as far as he chooses his hen coop no
tion of government he piques public curiosity by briefly
remarking: "My running mate, a woman, will be an
nounced later." This is as it .should be. A government
on the poultry plan needs a woman. No chicken ranch
succeeds without one.
He closes by announcing that, this preliminary docu
ment, is mailed only to leading publicationsâ we bow â in
this country and in the capitals of .Europe, also to the
President and Cabinet and to foreign potentates- Then
Mr. Inman, "saluting the world and extending the hand
of friendship 'to the hu'man'race," signs his name.
Mr. Hearst will take notice 'that he is not the only
candidate for the Presidency who blows his own horn.
It is" to be regretted, that, both want to run for the
Presidency, for Mr. Inman would make a fine candidate
for second place on Hearst's ticket, though it would in
volve a breach of promise to the woman who is to be
announced later.

HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL,
b HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN*. LONDON, May 4.â Most of
the biographies of th* late Dr. Samuel
Smiles fail-etS to mention that the fa
fnous author of "Self-Help" had a de
cided ta!enl for painting, and originally
went-d to be nn artist. The fact is
worth mentioning, however, as an ad
ditional proof of his many-sidedness.
Surg-eon. editor, railroad man, lecturer,
chemist, biographer, he not only turned
-his h*nd to many varied employments,
but made some sort of a success at
rach of them. And the themes of the
whole shelf-full of works turned out
by this literary veteran, who has Just
passed away at 91, are significant, as
snowing how n:any different subjects
appealed to him. "Physical Educa
tion." "The Huguenots in England and
Ireland" ar.d "Thrift" are not titles
that -would suggest works by the
Vame author, and though most of his
many works are similar In being bio
graphical, the careers that he under
took to trace were unlike enough â com
prising as they did. those of Stephen
,s?or>, she engineer; Thomas Edward, the
r.^turaUFt: John Murray, the publieh
er; Jasmin, the barber, poet and phil
anthropist, and Josiah Wedgewood, the
â¢potter.
In 2pite of, or perhaps because of
the fact that few men's Works ever ap
proached the circulation of "Self-Help."
no one seems to have any idea of how
much Dr. Smiks made out of it. For
â¢A Publisher and His Friend?."' how
ever. Dr. Smiles received $10,003 down.
CU"t of the profits of "Self-Help" Its
author built himself an uncommonly
comfortable house in the suburbs of
London, and on th? foundation, stone
was placed a copy of the book from
which young m-n of so many nation
alities have imbibed its writer's prin
ciple of reliance on oneself. Cecil
Rhodes was one of these. Opening a
new library in a small South African
tov n. the Colossus once said: "I have
been called an empire-makT. I don't
know about that. But there's one
thine I know and am sure of, and that
is," and here he lifted Dr. Smiles' "Self-
Help." "that Â«re have here what is still
betterâ a man-maker, a character
maker." A query made yesterday at
one of the: largest public- libraries in
London as to whether there still was
ary considerable demand for "Self-
Hclp" elicited the reply that only one
work of the kind was called for bo
often. Thut, Americans will take some
pride in hearing, was Lorlmer's "Let
ters From a Self-Made Merchant to His
Son.'
Dr. Smiles' immense vigor even when
nearing 30 excited the wonder of every
onr- who met him. Within a year of his
death â at 81 â he still took his morning
wa!k. smoked three or four cigars a
day. indulged in a certain number of
glasses of port, and did a good deal of
reading â without glasses. One of the
last books that this old Scotchman read
before his death was- "Wee Macgree
gor."
It will be welcome news to the ad
mirers of the late George GIssing that
an opportunity is now offered them to
show their appreciation both of the
man and his books. The English So
briety of Authors. London, has invited
contributions to a fund for the purpose
of keeping flowers on his grave in the
little cemetery of St. Jean de Lur in
the south of France. It is from a
Frenchman that the suggestion orig
inally emanated that this tribute should
be paid to GiEslng'E memory, and in
making it he recalls the fact that when
Guy de Maupassant's mother died she
bequeathed a sum of money . to the
French Society of Authors to be de
voted to a similar pious purpose.
Some critics of the late Sir Edwin
Arnold's work have asserted that much
of his poetry lacks inspiration; that he
harnessed his Pegasus whenever he had
need of him and turned out verses much
as ho wrote leaders. How far wrong
these critics are has Just been shown
by a writer who quotes what Arnold
once told him of his methods of poeti
cal composition. "I do nqt at any time
force poetry," he said; "I must be thor
oughly in the mood. These moods come
imperatively, but very irregularly. My
method is this: Either I write first, and
roughly, on . scraps of paper, or my
daughter takes it down from my dic
tationâshe is the only one who can do
so for me â as I walk up and down the
room and smoke. , I put the rough notes
in my pocket until the next day. Then
I read the verse over arid over, correct
and copy all out myself, altering It
very much and filling It up. These
scraps 1 enter Into a sort of daybook
or ledger until the work Is nearly fin
ished. I treat the matter thus com
piled as the rough draft. I go over it
myself, polish it and transcribe it Into
a second book, which may . be called
the poem itself, but still In a rough
state. Then I copy It out again, and
finally, in a fair manuscript for the
printer. Every line of the poem, there
fore, passes through my mind three or
ffcur times." ;'-'.

Last of all they told the story of old
Captain Conkling and the Holyoke dam
â a story known to every -diver. It
seems there was a leak In thia dam,
and the water was rushing through
with so strong a suction that It seemed
certain death for a diver to go near
enough to stop the leak. Yet it was ex
tremely important that the leak be
stoppedâ in fact, the- saving of the dam
depended on it. So Captain Conkllng.
who was in charge of the Job, induced
one of his divers to go down, and re
luctantly the man put on his suit, but
instated on having an extra rope, and
a very strong one, tied around his
waist.
"What's that for?" asked Conkling.
"That's to help get my body out If
the life line breaks," said the diver.
"Go on and do your work." replied
Conkling, who had little u*e for senti
ment.
It happened exactly as the diver
feared. He was drawn into the suction
of the hole, and when they tried to pull
him up both hose and life line parted
and the man was drowned, but they
managed to rescue his body with the
heavy line, just as he had planned.
Then Conkling called for another
diver, but not a man responded. They
said they weren't that kind of fools.
"All right," said the captain, in his
businesslike way; "then I'll go down
myself and stop that hole." And he
called the'men to dress him.
At this time Captain Conkling was 73
years old and had retired long since
from active diving. But he was as
strong as a horse still, and no man
had ever questioned his courage.
In vain they tried to dissuade him.
"I'll stop that hole," said he. "and I
don't want any extra rope, either."
He kept his word. He went down.
and he stopped the hole, but It was
with his dead body, and to-day some
where in the Holyoke dam lie the bone3
of brave old Captain Conkling. incased
In fulf diving dress, helmet and hose
and life line, burled In that mass Â¦â¢Â£

after his body. â From Cleveland Mof

IT has been suggested to the Governor of Colorado
that he have the militia on guard on election day in
Denver. It is a. city election. Mr. Thomas: Patter
son/Democratic. United States Senator, has, in a public
tpeech, denounced the Democratic candidate "for 'Mayor
as a corrdptionist and", an expert in defiling the ballot
box. Â¦ Recent elections in Colorado have been impeached
as criminal reversals of the actual will of the people. Mr.
Shafroth, an able Democratic member of Congress long
in the service, whose seat in this Congress was contested
on the ground of fraud, after examining the evidence re
signed and asked that Mr. Bonynge, the contestant, be
awarded the seat.
It may be said that these events are not singular in
American politics and that similar disorders appear in
older States and what arc regarded as better ordered
communities in the East. But such events an<J revela
tions in Colorado take on peculiar significance, because
thci State has woman suffrage, and in the crimes against
*?ie purity of the ballot box it is shown that women were
participants and in some cases the active agents. This is
unpleasant. It is a rude awakening from the dream of
universal suffrage, in which the ballot in the hands of
women has been pictured as a purifying, influence that
would purge grossness and crime from American politi
cal methods.
It has been insisted by the proponents of woman suf
frage that not only would politics be whitened and burn
ished but that through the influence of woman upon the
laws the grogshop, gambling and the grosser vices that
arc the degradation of society would disappear. This
has been the claim of that good and strong woman Miss
Anthony and of her co-workers, the late Mrs. Stanton
and that devoted band that chose for its life work what
it called '"the emancipation of woman."
There seemed much reason in their argument. Insist
ing that the home derives -its beauty of character, its
cleanness of life* and all that makes it sacred from the
presence and influence of woman, all of which is con
ceded, the conclusion was reached that the same influ
ence enlarged , upon the ample field of politics would
bring it under the same ideal conditions that bless the
home. Has the expectation been realized? That is the
question that must be answered and the facts to answer
it must be sought in the States where woman suffrage
is the law and the political emancipation of woman is
complete.
We do not violate a proper neutralit}' on that issue
nor abandon a position .that is receptive, a mind open to
argument, when we express the opinion- that the facts as
shown in Wyoming. Colorado, Idaho and Utah do not
support the argument for universal suffrage. . To this it
is answered that if election frauds and the persistence of
vice that the law should suppress arc arguments against
female suffrage they also impeach male suffrage- " But
this begs the question.
No one has ever, claimc'd that the mere deposit of
suffrage solely with men would make an â¢ anti-ferment
against the evils of society. From the side of male suf
frage it is merely claimed that the ballot is not'an im
prescriptible privilege, but that it is a responsibility. It
has no inherent virtues nor self-acting merits. Men. are
not changed, by it nor it by them. In its use they
neither gain nor lose any pre-existing quality or charac
teristic. As a responsibility they may discharge it well
or ill as they do other obligations. It is merely a device
and the only means for ascertaining the will of the,ma
jority in a free society founded upon the theory that the
majority rules. â¢ ...;.-..-
But for woman suffrage it/is "claimed that the ballot
in. woman's hand is a more* sacred thing. ,. It is an exor
cism of vice, .a sort of sacramental thing that takes on
the healing influence of moral medication for the cure
of those evils that. are in the marrow of all human so
ciety. We appreciate the enthusiasm and devotion which
can see in such a ballot- the means of making of 'ail so
ciety a place of purity, modeled upon the best homes. If
such a result were possible it would end all contention.
But the. experiment is still, on' trialon a very extensive
field. The home' condition has not been projected into
politics. Has the political condition been projected into
the home?
Moral conditions are never at the angle of repose.
They are restlessly moving in one direction or the other.
Woman, free of the responsibility of the ballot, has pro
tected the home against the demoralization of politics.
Can she do so with the responsibility of the ballot box
upon her? Can she. march and fight and do home guard
duty at the same time is the problem. If her marching
and fighting accomplish nothing but leave the home cit
adel unguarded can" her 'field -duty. be. justified? That is
the problem and the answer: of facts in ; Colorado does
not seem to sustain the argument for woman suffrage.
An Unknown Botanist.
"Whether he be a man of science or a
crank is. all guesswork, but the strange
actions indulged In by him for the
past six yearsÂ»have attracted the atten

peculiarities. ,
The man seems to be a foreigner
from his dress, his general appearance
and also his accent. This strange in
dividual makes a periodical visit to
Golden Gate Park on the first of each
and every month with a regularity only
equaled by the revolution of the earth
round the sun. Getting off the car
at the Park entrance on Haight street,
he walks directly* to the Panhandle,
where a large fir j tree stands out in
prominence. Just as his watch points
to the hour of 12 he takes from his
pocket a tape and makes careful
measurement of the circumference of
the big fir -tree, noting the same In a
memorandum book which he carries
wrapped in a piece of oil silk and tied
about with a string. Having perform
ed this delicate operation he takes ob
servations on the leaf expansion, the
height and other features of the tree,
also making notes of the same. This
done he leaves the park and returns to
the city. . v
With the exception of one grlpman
on the Haight-street line, this strange
individual has never mentioned his ob
ject in taking observations on his fa
vorite tree. To this man he once con
fided the information that that tree
grows one Inch in circumference every
year, with a proportional height and
exoar.sion. This valuable information
he is going to leave to future genera

ever read of his discovery until he

HAYDEN CHURCH.
Where Royalty Is.
The private apartments of Windsor
Castle have been so changed that no
one who saw them prior to Queen Vic
toria's death would recognize them to
day. This is especially the case with
Queen Alexandra's personal suite of
rooms, which were those that Queen
Victoria kepi specially as her own.
Thus all the old-fashioned furniture
and hangings have been removed, and.
instead of being somber, as formerly,
everything is light and airy. The win
dow hangings of the Queen's bedroom
and those of her bed are of wftlte sat
in, embroidered with the Imperial
crown, while the walls are paneled in
soft rose silk, and the furniture, of
which there is not overmuch in this
room, is of the daintiest empire period.
The <Â£essing-room and bathroom ad
joining: the bedroom are quite different
to what they formerly were. The
dressing- room has pink marble tables
and silver fittings, and the bathroom
is paneled with white marble and
Sheraton wood. All the fittings in this
room are of silver, while the marbles
used come from" Greece, from quarries
which have only recently been opened
after having been .closed nearly 1000
years. The predominating color of the

panels, the window hangings and the
thick, heavy carpets â the latter woven
in Ireland, not in Turkey- â are all of
that color. The altting-room of the

a bedroom by his father, has a high
wooden dado of fine solid mahogany,
with beveled panels and pilasters run

painted an ivory whiteJ The ceiling is
not painted, but is left, perfectly white,

straining Thomas Mannix. a contrac

thwalte's firm and the Henry Cowell
Lime and Cement Company. The af
fidavit sets up that Judge Hunt erred
In sustaining Mannlx's demurrer to
the original suit for an Injunction
brought by the Henry Cowell Lime
and Cement Company and that the
plaintiff is now entitled to an injunc
tion on Its amended complaint con
taining the facts, the absence of which
from tho original complaint brought
about Judge Hunt's decision. The af
fidavit also contains the assertion that
there never existed at any time a con
spiracy on the part of the Â¦ Holmes
Lime and Cement Company and the
Henry Cowell LIm6 and Cement Com
pany and the Contracting Plasterers'
Association to comer the lime trade
or to form a trust. Postlethwaite de

The members of the Public Health
Commission of California met yester
day morning in the rooms of the
United States Marine Hospital Ser
vice on Merchant street Matters per
taining to the general health were dis
cussed and acted upon, principal
among them being the use of street
[ sweepings in Golden Gate Park as a
fertilizer. Health Officer D. F. Ragan
called attention to the fact that this
character of debris, Instead of being
Incinerated, was carted to the pity's
playground and that he had found
cases of diphtheria as a result of its
baccllli. Secretary Louis King of the
. Merchants' Association said that the
sweepings might be used on the sand
dunes for the purpose of making
young trees grow and a sort of a com
promise was effected by an order
compelling the garbage men to wet
the refuse down bo that it will not
blow about.
The careless handling of garbage on
the streets by scavengers and the prac
tice of shaking carpets* out of doors
were pronounced nuisances and Sec
retary Louis Levy-was directed to ad
dress a communication to the Board
of Health on both matters. Dr.
Regensburger made a motion that the
commission recommend to the Board
of Health that the street sweeping
nuisance be abated and that each
member of the commission bo em
powered to wear a badge that could
be used in effecting arrests of violators
of health ordinances.
A resolution was adopted whicH will
prevent the removal of rags, sacks,
ropes and second-hand clothing from
the Chinese quarter, and Drs. Blue,
Ward and Regensburger were ap
pointed a committee on ways and
means.
The meeting waa attended, by Drs.

The Board of Education yesterday
had under consideration the salary
schedule for principals, teachers, jani
tors and other employes of the Public
School Department. No definite con
clusion was arrived at by the board
with the exception of an agreement to
increase the salaries of deputy super
intendents of schools from $150 to $200
per mo-nth. The Board of Supervisors
has been requested to provide the
necessary funds for the increase and
if allowed, the salaries will be fixed at
the higher figure.
The proposed raise will affect Depu
ties MacurUa, Suzzalo, Heaton and
Shelley. An attempt was 'made during
Superintendent Webster's administra
tion to have the salaries increased, but
as Webster and the Phelan Board of
Education were not on good terms at
the 1 time the attempt was unsuccess
ful, v
The board ruleo\against the proposed
schedule of salaries for the principals
of primary schools as submitted by
Commissioner of Public Works Wood
ward. Woodward sent a communica
tion in which he states that he is well
aware that any schedule founded arbi
trarily upon the number of classes is
not entirely satisfactory. He believes,
however, that it is fairer and less ob
jectionable to increase the salaries by
$3 for each additional class than to
have the pay the same for different
sized schools. Under Woodward's
schedule the salaries of six principals
will remain unchanged; those of thirty
one will be .increased and ten will be
slightly reduced.
The board objected to the plan be
cause it reduced some salaries and it
desires to announce that its policy will
be not to reduce "salaries, but, if the
funds are adequate, to increase them. â¢
The proposition of raiding the salar
ies of all teachers earning less than $60
per month to $60 was tnoroughly dis
cussed, but no action was taken, it
being agreed by the board to meet
again to-morrow afternoon; when the
salary schedule will be adopted fc-r the
next fiscal year. Assistant Secretary
Berliner figured that it would require
$23,000 to make the minimum salary
560, but that the board had some doubt
as to the correctness of the amount.
He was instructed to verify his figures.
;If the board finds that it has not
enough money to fix the minimum at
$60, a compromise of $55 will be adopt
ed and six years allowed to reach the
maximum of $83, instead of ten years
as at present. v
The board opened bids for supplies
for the Public School Department
The bids will bt tabulated with a view
to ascertaining the lowest bidder, to
whom the contract will then be
awarded.

Death has closed the promising ca
reer of Adolph^Boas. The young man
passed away at his late residence, 1293
O'Farrell street, yesterday morning at
an early hour, surrounded by members
of his family. The news of his demise
will be received with regret by his
many friends. He was a member of the
Olympic Club and was well known in
social circles of this city.
The deceased was one of the first to
offer his services to his country when
the President called for volunteers for
the Philippine war. He was enrolled
as a member of Company G of the
First California Regiment and went to
the- Philippines. - Although in many en
gagements he escaped without injury,
but, unfortunately, fell a victim to the
tropical climate. On his return to his
native city he contracted a severe cold,
and this developed into tuberculosis,
the primary cause of death.
* Deceased was' a son of Judah Boas,
the capitalist. He. . was , given every
care and comfort, and despite this fact
he could not withstand the dread dis
ease. The/ funeral will be held at 2
o'clock to-day. The body will be cre
mated at Odd Fellows' Ser

When Herman F. Gompertx, who was
IS years old last February, married
pretty Mary L. Kammerer he omitted
to secure his father's permission. As
the law does not recognize a minor's
contract unless sealed by the
consent of Â¦ a guardian, the tie that
bound the youthful couple had in it a
fatal flaw. Albert Gompertz, Herman's
father, did not approve of the mar
riage. He filed suit for Its annulment
on the grounds that his son was- under
age and had married without his
father's consent. Judge Kerrigan yes
terday annulled the marriage.

He not only says that he was never
anything but a good, kind, true, loving

the interference of his wife's father and
mother there never would have been
any serious trouble. He says that after
having had a little row with his wife
he prevailed upon her to forgive him,
and she promised not only to do so, but
to return to him. She would have done
so, says Plath, but that her parents
would not give their consent.

The order is the result of a peculiar
entanglement in the Smith family.
Mrs. Smith, some months before her
death, when she was childless, made
a will in which she left her estate to
her husband, and provided that, he
should pay her mother $100 a month.
She made no chanpe in the will after
her child was born, and when ten days
after the birth of the little one Mrs.
Smith died and the" will' had been pro
bated her mother demanded her al
lowance. Butler Smith, widower of
the deceased, refused to pay her the
full amount and held that the birth of
the child reduced : her share. In the
estate. His contention was sustained
by Judge Troutt. ' , .
Judge Troutt'a order giving to Mrs.
Ella Chamberlain, a monthly income
of $83 33 out of the estate of her de
ceased daughter, Ella Roberta Smith,
instead of the $100 a month devised'to
her in Mrs. Smith's will, is displeasing
to Mrs. Chamberlain.. Yesterday she
filed notice that she would take an
appeal from the order to the Supreme
Court. ;,'Â¦Â«â¢*Â¦;

FINE TIME CARD
After arguments by Attorney Alford
for the defense and by Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Whiting, the Judge said
that the defendant had had a fair trial
and that the verdict was in accordance
with the evidence.- None of -the-affi
davits filed by the defense altered the
material facts as to the murder, and
he would therefore deny the motion for
a new trial. A motion for - arrest of
Judgment was then made and denied.
MOTION* IS DENIED.
The prosecution then submitted a
number of counter affidavits by Frit?
Dirking Ernest Fournier, Mrs.
Clementina Dirking, C. P. Wright, Dis
trict Attorney Bylngton and the twelve
jurors who tried the case, all denying
the allegations in the affidavits of the
defense. â¢ . Â¦-'.Â¦â¢â¢-
When the case was called Attorneys
Alford and Spinetti filed two more affi
davits in support of the motion for a
new trial. One was by Francis J. Mc-
Carthy, who averred that although
Dirking Sr. was a total stranger to
him Dirking had told him seven months
prior to the murder that he would kill
Feld for bothering him and his family.
The other was by Thomas Sweetman,
a butcher's assistant, who averred that
the Iron bar In evidence, or one much
like it, had been seen by him at the
Dirking home.
-Attorney Spinetti wanted to testify
that C. P. Wright, one of the Jurors,
had said to him on May 12: "I said to
Gray, 'Did you see the article about
me? It did not harm me a d d bit,
as the Judge gave me a good send
off.' " The statement was put on the
record. . â¢ , . . . . . . .-.*..
Joseph Feld, ex-policeman, utterly
collapsed yesterday when Judge
Dunne, after denying the motion for a
new trial and for arrest of judgment,
sentenced him to be hanged at San
Quentin on a date to be hereafler fixed.
Feld's crime was the murder of his
father-in-law, Fritz Dirking, at the
Dirking hbme, 11. Fair avenue, on the
night of November 2. There was a hec
tic flush on his face as he stood up In
the dock to hear sentence of death
passed upon him, but after he had
taken his seat his face turned as white
as a sheet and he fainted. He seemed
to be in a fit, as his eyes rolled, his
body shook and his hands beat against
the walls of the dock. Bailiff Brophy
and Deputy Sheriff Minert carried him
to the City Prison and Coroner Leland
was sent for, as it was feared that he
might have taken poison, but the doc
tor after examining him said he was
simply in a state of collapse and would
soon recover. Under the directions of
the doctor he was placed on his back
in a ceil. Dr. Rottanzl, the jail physi
cian, was also notified, and he hurried
to the prison. -He agreed with the Cor
oner "and instructed the Sheriffs depu
ties to take Feld to the Jail as soon as
he had fully recovered.

Considerable money that has hereto
fore been allowed the Tax Collector for
the salaries of field collectors may now
be turned over to the Police Depart
ment, as said yesterday that
a good deal of that work could easily
be done by the police. Tax Collector
Smith was sent for in order that the
I "In London the police force is about
sixteen times stronger than it is here,
and still our city covers nearly half the
area of London, and New York has
more than four times as many police
men, and its area is comparatively the
same as this city's. The strength of the
police should not be governed so much
by the population of a city as by its
area."
Police Commissioner J. R. Howell
compared the strength of the London
an J New Tork Dollce forces with that
of our own. He said:
That there is but poor police protec
tion in our city was acknowledged by
Chief of Police Wittman ''yesterday
morning when the Police Commission
ers appeared before the Finance Com
mittee of the Supervisors.
WUtman stated that the police force
Is so 'small that It Is impossible to pa
trol many of the districts of the city,
and that some of the outer ones are ab
solutely unprotected.
Two hundred more officers are asked
by the department, besides a' corre
sponding number of corporals, ser
geants and lieutenants^ and Wittman
asks that the .postion of sub-chief be
created in order . that a man ranking
higher than a captain can Isuperintend
the work of the different police cap
tains and their men.
Brandenstein remarked that owing to
insufficient funds it would be impossi
ble to allow 200 more men on the force,
but that 'in all probability from ten to
twenty-five more men might be al
lowed.
The controversy between Spokane
and the tide water cities js based!" upon
a proposition in transportation that
has long been contended for. Port
land, Tacoma and Seattle hold that
they, being in a position to get low
rates by sea that' must be met by the
rail lines, are entitled to avail them
selves of the' advantages of their geo
graphical position in relation to sea
movements of freights and therefore
to have lower rates than any point re
moved from the seaboard and so un
able to establish water competition.
" In a general way this was the funda
mental proposition underlying the con
troversy that was raised by the Pa
cific Coast manufacturers and jobbers
when the St. Louis jobbers brought
their now famous suit before the In
terstate Commerce Cbmmissi&n against
the coast' jobbers and' the "transcon
tinental railways and were worsted.
'Spokane desires to get ' rates that
are contested' by Portland, Tacoma
and Seattle on the ground indicated.
The entire matter will now be talked
over at Chicago, President H. D.-Love
land representing the coast manufac
turers and jobbers. The proceedings
are of the greatest interest to the en
tire Northwestern country and also to
all points on the seaboard of the Pa
cific slope.
H. D. Loveland, president of the-Pa
ciflc Coast Manufacturers' 'and i job
bers' Association, will lea>*e this city
to-night â¢ to go to Chicago^ where^a
conference will take place with rail
road men doing business in the North
west relative to the Spokane rates on
freights. | A lively controversy has
been in progress recently among the
cities on the Sound. and Portland and
Spokane. This has found its way into
the newspapers published in the
Northwest and has been the reason' for
considerable caustic writing and
speaking. , tt â¢Â¦ _, . i " '
The last step in the land frauds hear
ing before United States Commissioner ;
Heacock was taken yesterday morn- '
Ing when the commissioner turned De
fendants Fred A. Hyde and Henry P. j
Dlmond over to the custody, of Marshal \
John H. Shine and ordered that they
be held for trial on the conspiracy
charge before the Supreme. Court of
the District of. Columbia. The defend
ants were Immediately ushered before
United States District Judge de. Haven,
who was tffcked by Government-Coun
sel Heney for. an order and warrant
to remove them .to Washington, j ]
Attorneys Knight and Schleslnger for
the defendants asked that they be
heard in opposition to the motion and
announced that they desired to argue
the questions raised by Heacock's de
cision. In view of Heney's engagement :
in the Oregon land frauds case at Port- \
land, counsel agreed to set the argu- i
ment down for July 15, and to this
Judge de Haven consented. . :
Judge de Haven 8_ald he, would ac- j
cept bonds in the. sums named on Fri- '
day by Commissioner Heacock â $30,000
for Hyde and $20,f~0 for.Di.mond. As
Hyde's bondsmen, Henry S. Morris, the
Oakland banker, and Leander. S. Sher- I
man of Sherman, Clay & Co., qualified
and were accepted, while bail for Di- I
mond - was furnished by William R. |
Sherwood of Sherwood, & Sherwood, ;
William R. Wheeler of, Holbrook, Mer- ;
rill & Stetson, and Ferdinand Reis Jr. !
These formalities completed the de
fendants were released.
On the hearing of Heney's motion for
the warrant of remo-yal in July, the
defendants' counsel will raise a num
ber of questions based on the volumin- t
ous record in the recent proceeding be
fore the commissioner. As this record
covers more than 4000 pages of testi
mony and argument, with hundreds of
Heac'ock's rulings to which the defend
ants entered exceptions, it will furnish
ammunition for a long bombardment.
If. defeated before Judge de Haven,
the defendants may appeal to the Cir
cuit 'Court of Appeals or open a new
proceeding on a writ of habeas corpus.
Hence it is unlikely that Hyde and Di
mond will be taken to Washington for
many months.
The group of Government officials
j who spent the last eight weeks here
In connection with the preliminary ex-
I animation broke up yesterday, and
most of Its members have returned to
Washington. Special Counsel Francis
J. Heney left for Portland last even
ing. There he will represent the Gov
ernment in the prosecution of the Ore
gon case, which is similar in some of
its aspects to the Hyde-Benson mat
ter. The Oregon defendants are Hor
ace G. McKinley, S. A. B. Puter, Miss
Marie Ware and Mrs. Emma L. Wat
son. They were indicted by the United
States Grand Jury for the District of
Oregon on charges of conspiracy to
defraud the Government out of public
lands, Just as Hyde, Benson et al. have
been Indicted for a like conspiracy
here.

necessarily are they expensive, for when the style and wear-

ASVÂ£B>TISZlCE27TflLEdith Williams, who left her home
on Thursday afternoon ostensibly to
visit a lady friend has not returned to
her family, who are all waiting anx
iously to receive her, regardless of
what she may have done.
Regarding the whereabouts of the
missing girl all kinds of rumors were
current yesterday, but nothing of a
tangible , nature. Dozens of peoplo
had seen her in all kinds of different
places. All kinds of messages poured
in all day to the distracted family
from both friends and strangers, each
one stating that the missing girl had
been seen by them in one place or an
other. Many were largely conjectures.
A report that perhaps is the most
authentic of all was that the mlssins
girl had been staying at 100 McAllister
street. Detective Coleman at once
hurried to the- lodging-house at that
location. When the landlady, Mrs.
Sutclisse, was shown the photograph
of Edith Williams she at once stated
that that was the girl who had come
to her house Thursday evening and
had remained there until yesterday
morning. She stated that the room
for the girl had been engaged early in
the afternoon by a man whom she did
not know. The girl did not come Into
the room until about 7 o'clock in the
evening. V
Mrs. Sutclisse says the girl did not
receive any visitors. Yesterday morn
ing when the landlady went to make
up. the room she found the girl had
gone.
The room had been paid for in ad
vance. Mrs. Sutclisse said the girl was
quiet and well-behaved. She particu
larly noticed the peculiar color of her
hair, which is of an unusual shade.
Since her departure from 100 McAl
lister street nothing has been heard of
her, either by the police or the family.
The police do not believe that the
girl has met with foul pjay, and they
say she will undoubtedly be located
within a day or so.
The police are positive that the girl
is still in hiding in the city.

HEARST WEAK IN* THE NORTH.
ST. PAUL. Minn., May 14.â "William
R. Hearst has no more show to carry
.Minnesota, North Dakota or Montana
than has the Czar of Russia," said a
Democrat of national prominence to
day. \ .
"Hearst is wasting his money; he Is
evidently misled by those who are tap
ping his barrel," L. A. Rosslng, chair
man of the Democratic State Commit
tee, said to-day. "At the outside Hearst
will not have more than 15 per cent of
the delegates to the State Convention.
There is but very little Hearst senti
ment in the State. In my correspond
ence with leaders throughout the State
I fail to. find where Hearst cuts any
figure." .
FARGO, N. D. M May 14.â Hearst is
out, of all calculations of. the Demo
crats. He is not even counted as a pos
sibility.. It is doubtful if his name will
be mentioned In the State Convention.
Hls!candidacy is looked upon as an ad
vertisement for. his many papers and is
not- considered legitimate.
HELENA, Mont, May 14.â There is
no Hearst sentiment In this State. The
Democrats will have none of him. \ All
the reports \ purporting to have been
sent from this State to the Hearst
papers are pure falsification. Trtey
were never sent. Democrats here sajr
the idea of Hearst cutting any figure
in Montana is* absurd." * : . \%

DELEGATES TO NATIONAL. CON
VENTION ELECTED BY THIRD
CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT;.
Delegates from the Country to the
Democratic State Convention, which is
to send representatives to St. Louis,
do not propose to calmly sit down and
allow the Hearst element to say what
shall be done. In fact 280 votes de
cided last night that Hearst -was not
entitled to 6uch an honor as is re
quested by his managers, and to that
end the following standing committee
was appointed:
Geary, Farnsworth, Finlayson, Leake,
Conan, Lynch, Harrell.
That committee is to be strictly an
tagonistic to Hearst and will have the
making of all arrangements to bring
about the defeat of the New York Con
gressman and erstwhile editor." ' The
committee will discuss how best the
end can be reached as the trip Is made
to Santa- Cruz this morning, on the 8:15
train. . - 11 '_
James H. Barry's office was used last
night by the country delegates, who
represented the 2S0 votes, to bring
abtfut this final conclusion.
The country delegates assembled
and represented by proxy decided by
unanimous vote to oppose the instruc
tion of the delegation to St. Louis or
the insistence of the unit rule. It was
contended in the caucus that a unit
rule has never been the policy of the
Democrats of California and that if
the country delegates, protested against
any such action it would be in keep-
Ing with the past history of the State.
It was realized that a unit rule
would be beneficial to Hearst in a
roundabout way and the country del
egates desired to put their stamp of
disapproval upon any such indorse
ment or action. . .'-
The entire matter v.ill be fought out
upon the floor of the convention and
when it comes to a vole the 280 del
egates reoresented' in last' night's
meeting will cast their ballots against
any instructions and the unit rule.
In order to increase* that vote and
if possible carry the point at i?3ue| the
country delegates, as represented In
the. meeting last night, will open head
quarters in Santa' Cruz with the in
tention of defeating W. R. Hearst by
securing an uriinstructed Â¦ delegation
from California.
Frank Finlayson of Los Angeles is
recognized as a stanch Democrat.
He is a delegate to the convention and
will insist upon that body passing a
resolution providing that no candidate
shall be indorsed who will not pledge
himself to support the Democratic
ticket nominated at St. Louis. Finlay-
Bon will Introduce a resolution to that
effect and expects to have it adopted.
Such a resolution in the California
convention means a deathknell to
Hearst's aspirations of securing a,
pledged delegation, according to Fin
layson's Idea, He hopes by the reso
lution to place Hearst on record and
force him to stand - by j the nominee
of the national convention in . the
event that Judge Parker or some
other Eastern man is selected for
standard-bearer. .
There Is a report that I. B. Dock
weiler of Los Angeles will talk against
the indorsement of any aspirant who
will not pledge himself. to support the
nominee of the St. Louis convention.
That, of course, means Hearst, who is
expected by the rank and file to kick
over the â¢ traces In his numerous
editorial columns in the event of his
failure to secure the nomination at the
hands of the Democratic party in St.
Louis.
Gavin McNab, who is supposed to
handle the Democratic politics of San
Francisco, remained here to consult
with delegates and politicians who
came In on the late trains from the in
terior. He was closeted at the Occi
dental Hotel last night with a number
of delegates who had missed the Santa
Cruz train.
Just what McNab was doing with the
belated delegates he . declined to state.
Propose to Fight
the Programme
of Hearst.
WASHINGTON, May 14.â William R.
Hearst will support the nominee of the
St. "Louis Democratic convention, who
ever he ma y be. He to-day authorized
the 'Washington Post to make this
statement unequivocally. He ridiculed
a story sent from Albany that he and
Mr. Bryan, Arthur Brisbane, Weaver
of Iowa- and others were planning a
huge bolt and the formation of a new
party. He said he had been making his
fight for the nomination in the name of
progressive Democracy, but his fight
had been within party lines and would
continue to be so. Whatever the re
sult, he intended personally and
through his newspapers to support the
regular ticket.
**'.'! am for the St. Louis jnomiriee,"
said Hearst to the Post. Having ut
tered that plain spoken sentence he
added with a smile:
"I should, of course, like any other
man. be honored and gratified should
the Democrats see fit to nominate me.
But I do not have to be bribed by of
fice to bo a Democrat. I have support
ed the Democratic ticket' in the last
five campaigns. I supported Cleveland
three times and Bryan twice. I intend
to support the nominee of the party at
St. Louis, whoever he may be."
The Interview was prompted by the
Albany dispatch, which said ! that
Hearst, Bryan, Brisbane and a few
others were preparing to bolt.
"I have not been able," he said, "to
deny all the foolish things that
have been said about me. I have not
even kept up with, all that has been
said. But of- all the fool things that is
'fooler' than all the rest," and Hearst
indulged In a hearty laugh at the new
adjective he had coined.
"I have been making my fight for the
nomination in the name of progressive
Democracy," he said. "I have been
making my fight on party lines."
An lnquir>%was.made^aboiit>the sigr
nificance dik -the several Â¦ 'contesting
Hearst delegations over the 'country. ' â¢'
"Every State convention of "both par
ties has contesting delegates," said^
Hearst. "ContesTs "do "not mean that'
bolting will' 'follow. Some of my
friends have 'instituted contests far
delegates. In certain cases contests
have been instituted by my friends, in
entire sincerity on their part, which 1
would not have sanctioned had the
matter come to my knowledge in time.
But these contests can be settled in
the usual way, as they are settled in
every national convention. Please make
it plain that I stand for the verdict of
loyal Democrats, men who have been
loyal to the party and have not been
Democrats at pleasure. I am for men
who have been Democrats consistently
for twenty years." . : '
"But suppose the class you suggest
as disloyal should be in control at St.
Louis?" . .
"I think there is no danger of that.
It is safe to trust the Demopratic mass
es," was the answer.
"But they would be the people who
sent these men to the convention in a
majority," to which / remark he as
sented. .
Nevertheless he expressed the belief
that loyal Democrats would be in con
trol at St. Louis and reiterated his
intention to support the nominee of
that convention.
.In' fact, his utterances were so direct
and emphatic on that point that no
room was left to doubt Hearst's loyalty
and hisintentic-n to prosecute his cam
paign for the no'mlnation. within the
party lines, and not only to abide by
the result, whatever it might* be, but
to work for the ticket nominated.
Aspirant Says He Stands for

AVill Abide by the Kesult
. 6A2CTA CRUZ, May 14.â The Hearst
boomers are first on the scene of action
fcnd are claiming everything in sight,
and the surprising Incident Is that
there is no one of the unterrified De
mocracy here to rigorously dispute
their claims. The Odd Fellows* Hall
â¢on Pacific avenue, with an auditorium
large enough to seat all the delegates
to the convention, has been reserved
for the Hearst headquarters. "Gov
ernor" Tarpey and staff have spacious
apartments at the St. George. J. P.
â¢Newton and Frederick Harkness of the
Los Angeles delegation arc at the Sea
Beach Hotel.
" The delegates from the south arrived
late to-night and declared without hes
itating to count noses that fifty of the
fifty-five of the Ix>s Angeles contingent
are for Hearst to the finish. Al Mur
â¢phy. chief adviser on the staff of Gov
ernor Tarpey. has displayed skill and
tact in smoothing out wrinkles and
making easy places for the anti-Hearst
Relegates to light.
The number of delegates to the con
rertion Is "22 and the managers of the
Hearst campaign assert that not more
than TOO will oppose the resolution to
instruct. No doubt there will be many
utterances on the floor of the conven
tion against the folly and absurdity of
Sending to the national gathering at
St. Louis a delegation of twenty mes
senger boys instead of a score of free
and unhampered disciples of Thomas
Jefferson.
In the days of the old California
Democracy, when Stephen M. White,
W. W. Foote, Thomas J. Clunie. Wil
Â»iam Du English and Frank Moffitt were
bright lights of the organization, the
idea of instructing a delegation was
spurned, and the record is 'now pro
duced to show that Barney Murphy,
M. F. Tarpey and Frank H. Gould
were- conspicuous among the spurners.
MAXY STATESMEN* ARRIVE.
Former Speaker Howe of Sonoma Is
here. His delegation has been advised
to-oppefse instruction. In his judgment
â¢ it" does not follow that Sonoma is to
carry an anti-Hearst banner, but is ex
pected to bear aloft the standard
against instruction for any candidate.
Thomas Geary, former Congressman,!
orator and statesman, will arrive here
to-morrow. It is said that Franklin K.
Kane ajid Isadore Dockweiler will also
come. Gavin McXab is also expected.
' rt is presumed - that the leaders
*. against instructions will confer' and
pass out a programme to the San Fran
cisco delegation. The question is, "Will
the metropolitan delegates take the
: programme?" Word is given out at
â¢ rhe Hearst temple that all but nine of
. the 108 delegates from San Francisco
hare accepted seats in the Hearst band
â¢ â¢Â» agon. On the other hand, it is claimed
. ttat the delegation will do whatever
is 'best for the "organization," and in
| s'idere remark that Gavin McNab is the
â¢ organization.
'The great throng of delegates will ar
, rive upon the trains due here to-mt>r
row evening, and late to-morrow night
the canvassing will begin. Concerning
the chairmanship of the convention
everything is in the air.
M. F. Tarpey, chief of the Hearst
â¢ forces,, arrived to-night. Mark Plaisted
Of Fresno, advance guard of a delega
â t;on instructed for Hearst, is also here.
The Democratic State Convention will
â¢ be he>d as in a forest of pines through
v.hich sweeps the exhilarating breath
cf "the salt sea. Some recess of a near
"".by canyon has been denuded to trans-
Jorm Armory Hall, wherein the conven
tion will be held, into a giant bower of
green. No sign of beam or arch is visi
'.He in' the big structure, and where
/sweeping branches and fragrant fes
.' tooss are absent, flags and streamers
of -bunting hold the eye.
BRYAN'S PICTURE MISSING.
Most artistic in the scheme of decora
â¢ tion Is a canopy of flags that stretches
.from the gallery upon the v.est to end
lin sweeping drapery over the platform,
.behind "which rears a sounding board
of blue that will throw afar the elo
quence of the gathered Bourbons.
Tucked shyly to one side in this mass of
â¢Iraperj.' is a portrait of Thomas Jeffer
Â¦Â£on. It is the work of some gifted sign
.' painter, but alone as it is, there is
nothing to which its merits as a work
of .art can be compared. There is no
chromo of the great high priest Cleve
land hear, nor do the classic features
of parton saint Bryan beam in this
â¢ ionesome grallery.
Just one more effort is made to Ilght
.Â«?n the general scheme of decoration. A
picture of the battleship Oregon, whose
race against time and whose splendid
â¢light for the maintenance of a Repub
lican policy and Republican principle
..is. known round the world, is there to
inspire the Democratic hosts. It nar
'ro'wly miesea screening from view the
'one portrait that stands out aisid the
verdure. Suspended from the canopy
of flags are the trl-color shields that
bear the names of the counties. Upon
the east end of the hall, directly in
.front of the platform, a great' slice" of
the hall has been reserved for the San
Francisco delegationâ the Fourth and
Fifth Congressional districtsâ while
.north of this assignment, and also in a
position of- honor, has been placed -the
Ix>s Angeles delegationâ the " Seventh
Congressional District. The rest of the
districts have been spread back through
â¢ the hall without effort to preserve nu
merical or alphabetical order.
All in all. the Democrats should be
appreciative, for the citizens of Santa
Cruz have gone to great lengths to
make their visit here agreeable. Al
though the city does, not show- many
outward signs of Joy at the coming of
the â¢Democrats, nor. have, brass bands
yet begun to blare, the hall is all that
could be desired and uptown accommo
dations are of the best. - â¢ <

PORTLAND, May 14. â Keefe made
Mlque Fisher a birthday present of a
skut-out game to-day on his forty
first birthday. The game should have
been won by Portland. Cartwright
,threw the chance away when he failed
to touch third base on his race for
home on the long drive of Beck to
Center. Spencer's errors were costly
also and had their effect on the result.
From a pitchers' standpoint the game
was a brilliant one. The score:

Herbert Schmidt, representing
Boone's University School of Berkeley,
carried off the honors in the annual
tennis singles tournament yesterday
for the championship of the Academic
Athletic League. A good crowd was
on hand to witness the matches, which
were - played " on the California. Club
courts.
Schmidt's opponent In the finals
was Marius Hotchkiss, representing
Lick School, and winner of the 1903
tournament. Poor management al
most cost Schmidt the championship.
After playing three matches, the third
of which was exceedingly hard, he
was forced to play a nve-set match
with but thirty minutes' rest. Schmidt
ordinarily would have had no trouble
beating Hotchkiss, but the latter was
fresh, while the former was dead on
his feet when the match started.
As was expected, " by far the best
match of the tournament was that in
which Schmidt and Herbert Long of
Lowell High School were the contest
ants. These boys are the most prom
ising in the California Club and the
score shows they are evenly matched.
In the third set 'Long had Schmidt
within a point of the match, but tho
latter pulled out and won the decid
ing set, 10-8.
This match was the best ever played
in an academlo tournament, and at
times was roundly applauded. Both
players made brilliant shots,- although
they were extremely nervous through
out. Schmidt's years of tournament
experience undoubtedly won the
match for him.
' The final match was closer than the
Long-Schmidt match, but the tennis
was much poorer. Hotchkiss played
his usual careful game and got every
thing 1 back, while Schmidt was lacking
in both speed and accuracy. After
having a good lead In the .first set,
Schmidt lost ltÂ« 7-5. 'The reverse hap
pened in the second set. Hotchkiss
led at 5-3, but was beaten put In
the third set Schmidt played his best
tennis and his opponent' did not get a
game. The fourth set was exceedingly
close and finally went to Hotchkiss.
Both players were well used up in the
flfth set. Schmidt, with a fine burst
of speed, won out quite handily. . â¢*
Schmidt's victory was a popular
one, as he not only played excellent
tennis, but showed that he is game.
Of the preliminary matches, the
only one that was at all close was that
between Harold Gabriel of Wilmer
ding and Long. The latter was thought
to outclass his opponent, but Gabriel
forced him to play his best game to
win.

CHICAGO, May 14.â English Lad
being scratched from thÂ© fourth race,
interest in to-day's card centered in
the Worth opening race in which Peter
Paul, from the stable of Virginia Brad
ley, made his debut here. After finish
ing third to floral King and Monastic,
Peter Paul pulled up lame. The geld
ing showed a remarkably good race
considering his injury, which was at
first thought to be serious enough to
put him out of the Derby. He raced
to-day with a protecting plate over his
bruised heel and it is probable this
â¢wound was reopened. Bradley said,
however, that it was not serious and
would not keep him fnJm preparing the
three-year-old for the American Derby.
The race was won easily ( by Floral
King, the 6 to 5 favorite, while Mon
astic had all he could do-^o Peter
Paul a nose. Peter Paul was well
played, opening at 4 and closing at 7
to 2. Huzzah, backed from 12 to 1 down
to 5, won the handicap easily by two
lengths from the 14 ,to 5 favorite, Dan
McKenna. Although the weather was
cald and disagreeable a big crowd wit
nessed the races, which were run over
a fast track. Three favorites won.

MORRIS PARK. May 14. â The
fourth race, the Withers etake, was
to-day's best attraction. Odom had
the mount on Delhi and when the bar
rier was raised he pent the brown son
of Een Brush to the front, showing at
once that the pace was to be a fast
one. The colt wanted to run even
faster, but Odom at once took hold of
him. as did Redfern on Montreson,
bo that the two colts, both with arched
necks, did not appear to be running
at anything like top speed. The first
half mile was run in :48 4-6 and flve
furlongs In 1:01. When Delhi went
around the far turn and opened up an
even larger gap of daylight than
seemed necessary, many spectators be
gan u> wonder if any colt could keep
up such a pace.
As they came down the-Wll, Delhi
well out in the track, appeared going
easily. By this time he had all his op
ponents except Bryn Mawr beaten.
This colt stole along: near the rail. He
overhauled the pacemaker, but Odom
did not seem alarmed. He waited un
til about fifty yards from the finish,
when he let Delhi down and passed
the judges half a length In front of
Bryn Mawr. which was six lengths in
advance of Conjurer.
The last named ran like a "rater."
t>ut lacked speed. Montreson's defeat
was complete. Stalwart failed to flat
ter his backers. In fact, the form of
the Withers of 1904 bore out last
year's form, except that Bryn Mawr
is a much improved colt, likely to win
at longrer distances from racers sup
posed to be "â¢crackerjacks." Summary:

all skin diseases, appearing in many different forms; the dry '

swollen, moist appearance, with occasional profuse discharges of watery matter. But all
the varieties and types of this aggravating disease are akin and are caused by impure blood
and an over-acid condition of this vital fluid that seems to set the skin on fire, kindling a
flame that water will not quench, and an itching, stinging eruption that lotions, soaps, salves

again slfpped to the floor and as he
! canie up ' they clinched. O'Brien

PHILADELPHIA, May 14.â Kid Mc-
Coy and Jack O'Brien fought one of
the most scientific six-round bouts
'ever seen in this city to-night at the
Second Regiment Armory. At the close
of the bout-It would have been a diffi
cult task to pick the -winner. McCoy
had the better of the third and fourth
rounds, while O'Brien had the Kid ! in
trouble at the close of the fifth round
and also in the sixth. McCoy was vis
ibly in distress at the end of the sixth
round. He repeatedly ran away from
O'Brien and made no attempt to
counter when O'Brien led. There were
no marks on McCoy, while O'Brien's
left eye was bleeding. O'Brien's blows
lacked force, and this fact alone prob
ably saved McCoy from being knocked
out. O'Brien landed the greatest num
ber of blows, but McCoy's punches had
more steam behind them.
Both men were weighed in at' 3
o'clock in the afternoon. The beam was
placed at 1F.S pounds, and both were
well within the limit. Neither fighter
announced his weight.
â¢ It was 10:30 o'clock when McCoy en
tered the ring. He was followed a
moment later by O'Brien. McCoy's sec
onds were his brother (Horn>r Selby),
Harry Foley, Charley Mitchell and
Billy Elmer. O'Brien's seconds were
Lew ' Bailey, Billy McCarney, Jim
Brady, Frank Strauss and Joe Reilly.
There were not over 2000 persons in
the big armory when the men entered
the ring.
Round 1â McCoy forced O'Brien
around the ring, but the latter drove
a left to the face and repeated it a
moment later with another. The men
came to a clinch'. O'Brien landed a
left on the face and a left on the
stomach. They rushed to a clinch. Mc-
Coy landed a light left on O'Brien's
stomach, and they clinched. They fid
dled for a second, and McCoy then
landed a left to the face. They again
rushed to a clinch. O'Brien crossed
McCoy with his right and then landed
a left and right to the face as the
gong sounded. O'Brien had done alj
the leading in this round,*but his blows
lacked force. '
"Kid" Is in Distress at the
End of a Great Six-Hound
Bout at the Quaker City
The form players are having their
troubles in trying: to select a winner
for the Billy Otts-Rube Smith fight of
to-morrow nisrht at the Reliance Club
in Oakland and the boys will probably
enter the ring at an even money basis.
Manager Arnold, who has been look
ing after Smith's interests, had an ar
gument yesterday afternoon which re
sulted in a S500 bet with Gua Hart
man, who favors the Californian. So
positive was Arnold that he was on
the right man that Hartman might
have received odds had he been less
vehement in support of Otts. Opinion
is equally divided on the subject of tho
possible winner, because so many
things enter Into the subject.
Otts hag never faced so large a man
before nor has he met a boxer with
the terrific punch that Smith pos
sesses. Smith has not put up hi3
hands asrainst as clever a man as Billy
since coming to California, but he has
done all that has been asked of him
and showed a decided aptltute for tak
ing care of himself all tho time. IC
the bout goes the limit it v/ill surprise
most of the knowing ones.
George Curran and Caesar Attel will
box ten rounds as a prelude to tho
main bout, while Tommy Taylor and
Jack Evans are to furnish tha four
round curtain raiser.

days later he's a dead -one. This was
clearly set forth yesterday at Recrea
tion Park in the case of one Oscar Gra
ham, the man who won fame and glory
by breaking up a certain fourteen
round struggle recently. The same Os
car brought down the wrath of the
populace on his head yesterday after
noon when he dropped Wheeler's* fly
in the ninth Inning and started the An
gels on a route to victory. Score, 7 to 3.
Up to that time it was a grand game
of ball. The score was three up, and
both teams were going the limit. Toman
was the first man up in the ninth, and
he successfully worked Schmidt for a
base on balls. He lost no time stealing
second. Flood sacrificed, and then
Wheeler popped up his fly to short left
and Mr. Graham did the ignoble act of
dropping the ball.
Toman arrived, and then the slaugh
ter commenced in real earnest. Bernard
came through with a double to center,
bringing in Wheeler. Cravath manipu
lated a "Texas leaguer" to right and
got to second, as well as placing Ber
nard on third. Bernard was forced by
Ross. He stole, and arrived with Cra
vath when Chase shoved a hot one past
Francks.

-'"fflSSfl^^^Ft^^^^'^-^ gestion, Constipation or any Weakness which I cannot cure with my new improved
: ''a\ Electric Belt, the marvel of electricians, the most wonderful curative device that has
â¢\V /Y/Txv* : v ' ever been introduced. This Belt is complete with Free Electrical Suspensory.
This Electric Suspensory carries the current direct and cures all weakness of men, varicocele, etc. It develops and expands
all weak nerves and checks a loss of vitality. No case of Failing Vigor, Varicocele or Debility can resist this powerful Electric
Attachment/ It never fails to cure.
Mr. E. F. Lqhman, Hooker, Cal., writes, March 11: "The feeling of despondency is gone and I have perfect confidence In myself now. I'm a well man."
No man should be weak, no man should suffer the loss of that vitality which renders life worth living. No man should allow
himself to become less a man than nature intended him, no man should suffer when there is at hand a certain cure for his weak-
ness. . f .'â¢
Most of the pains, most of the weakness of stomach, heart, brain and nerves, from which men suffer, are due to an early loss
of nature's reserve power. You/need not suffer for this. You can be restored. The'very element which you have lost you can get
back, and you may be as happy as any man that lives.
My Electric Belt, with special Electric Suspensory, will restore your power. It will check all loss of vital ppwer and affects
every organ of the body.
Mr. W. F. Quite, Reno, Nev.. writes, March 10: "Your Belt cured me after I had spent $1000 in useless doctorln*;. M
I have cured thousands of men who have squandered the savings of years in useless doctoring.
My Belt is easy to use; put it on when you go to bed; you feel the glowing heat from it (no sting or burn, as in old style
belts), and you feel the nerves tingle with the new life flowing into them. You get up in the morning feeling like a two-year-old.
An old man of 70 says he feels as strong and young as he did at 35. That shows it renews the vigor of youth. It cures Rheu-
matism, Sciatic Pains, Lumbago, Kidney Trouble. Banishes pain in a night, never to return.
Mr. A. C. Hammond. 330 Pine street. San Francisco, says, March 20: "At the age of 75 your Belt has cured me of general weakness and kidney trouble.**
What ails you? Write and tell me, and no matter where you are I think I can. give you the address of some one in your town that I have
cured. I've cured thousands, and every man of them is a walking advertisement for my Belt.
Every man who.uses my Belt gets the advice and counsel of a physician free. I give you all that any medical man can give, and a lot that
he can't.

another day of. fruitless balloting, the
Republican State convention took an
adjournment at 7:55 p. m. until 2
9'clock Tkjonday; afternoon, without hav
ing broken* the gubernatorial deadlock.
To-night the party leaders are in con

solution of the situation, but they ap
pear powerless, to da bo. â¢ The dels

"Within the last ten days she was out
buggy riding at a cost of $10 because I
chanced to be out of town on business.
I will say that my salary has never
permitted me to spend money in the
same reckless way. I have always tried
to do right. The annoyance and cha
grin of the sensational charge made by
her in a fit of temper must be my ex
cuse for not seeing some of the people
interested in my accounts.
"As far' as my family is concerned, I
know they are not hungry or in want
of a place to sleep. I am 'sorry Mrs.
Loring has built such a mountain out
of -bo simple a foundation, and once
more :I claim her charge is utterly
false." ..."
{ ;W. G.Lorlng: denies the recent sensa
tional charges made against him by his
wife, and says he. Is the victim of. her
inordinate temper.. Last night he made
the following statement:
' " In * n .* w er to my- wife'* sensational
and utterly false. charges of abuse and
desertion I desire to say that during our
married life- she * has always received
my full waffes. to .handle oa she has
seen fit; â¢ and : she, has always received
the rent from the roomers, I am at a
loss, to understand- her ridiculous and
annoying charges. Within three days
I have sent her money, but she refused
to take it. Yesterday I sent her $10 by
a friend, but she would not accept it.
"What more can I do? I am anxious
to provide for the children, and I have
never starved refused to support
her, though she has abused me. The
furniture was taken away by her or
ders after paying nearly $170 interest
within the last two years. Her poverty
and distress regarding furniture are
not as she would have It seem, as her
neighbor friend has stored two sets of
furniture, to be called for at Mrs. Lor
lng's pleasure.
"It Is true I owed one month's rent,
but this annoyance could have been
made endurable by a little patience on
her part. I solemnly state that I have
never failed to provide for any neces
saries for her or the children when my
means .could" supply them, and they
have never been hungry or without
clothing.

The soldier, crazed with liquor, .en
tered the shooting gallery conducted by
K. Taukasaki at 815 Kearny street
soon after 8 o'clock. He picked up a
rifle that lay on the counter and fired
two shots at a target. The Japanese
then requested him to pay for them,
but he refused and a wordy dispute
ensued. When the argument became
heated Ratchford, who still held the
rifle, aimed it at the proprietor's head
and fired. The bullet went but little
wide of its market and before a second
shot could be fired bystanders had dis
armed the intoxicated warrior. Police
men A. M. Smith and B. M. Clancy of
Sergeant Christiansen's* Chinatown
squad hurried to the scene and arrest
ed Ratchford. He gave them battle
and during the struggle Smith was
dealt a blow over the heart. The of
ficer did not feel any ill effects from it
until after he had locked his man up
and returned. to his post of duty. Then
he became suddenly, ill and his. heart
was extremely weak. He was removed
to- his home at â¢ 17 Oak street,* where
medical attendarce was afforded â¢ him.
William Ratchford, a soldier, ran
amuck on Barbary Coast last night
and. after taking a shot at a Japanese
with a rifle, struck a policeman a blow
over the heart and severely injured
him. Ratchford was taken into cus
tody and his name placed on the reg
ister at the Central Police Station.

The owners of the six factories in
this city have declared that they will
not resume operations except under the
open chop rule and It is possible that
the men may be out of employment for
several weeks. The trouble is directly
attributed to the action of the employes
of G. M. Kunz & Co., who walked out
some time ago.
The sympathy shpwn the striking
men by their fellow workmen in other
shops in this city was not approved by
the officers of the national organiza
tion, which ordered them to return to
work. In their failure to do bo it is
said that the local, union has Jeopar
dized its standing in the national body
and is liable for the forfeiture of its
charter. Â¦ The employers "declare that
they would willingly arbitrate with
their men if there 1 was anything to
arbitrate, but they insist that the union
is entirely In the wrong and support
their claim with the fact that the na
tional body of the union has declared
itself against the action of the local
employes.
It was estimated yesterday by those
concerned in the troubles between the
Boot and Shoe Manufacturers' Asso
ciation and the members of the Shoe
Workers' Union, which resulted in a
lock-out Friday, that nearly 700 men
in this city and Petaluma are now out
of employment.

the' entertainment given by the senior
class of 1904 under the direction of
Franz Goldstein. The programme
sisted of a three-act . farce entitled
"The Man In the Case," written by
Winthrop Packard, and originally pro
duced by the Emmanuel Club of Rad
cliffe College of Cambridge. The cast
was an excellent one and included
Miss Elsie Zetle. Miss Ethel Lucy, Miss
Carrie Parsons, Miss Rosa Dlehl. Miss
Emma de Boom and Miss Edith Stand
art; all of whom acquitted themselves
in a most creditable manner, a fact to
which the deeply Interested audience
frequently attested by its applause.

TS A CLEVER FARCE
SPOKANE, Wash., May 14. â While
on? robber climbed over the bar and
took $70 and some time checks from
McFarland & Helverson's saloon ,at
Hilgard. Or., last night, another thug
kept six pairs of hands up and inci
dentally shot John Thompson through
the right ear. Both robbers then
escaped through a rear door.
The desperadoes were masked and
entered the saloon through the front
door. Six men were in. the saloon at
the time, all prospectors. McFarland
attempted to go behind the bar, but
was ordered to stand back. One rob
ber stood guard near the door rvnd
compelled the men to line up against
the wall with .his hands raised. -John
Thompson was slow in raising his
hands and a shot nipped his ear. Then
his hands assumed the desired posi
tion. The robbers acted quickly and
appeared to be professionals.
Reislini? had turned out all the lights
In the tab and lighted a torch to in
spect lhe locomotive before he left It.
He stepped down from the cab and
with torch in hand he looked under the
boiler. He placed the torch near a
small opening in the firebox. Simul
taneously the gas ignited and a terrific
explosion occurred. The roof of the
roundhouse was blown off, and Rels
ling wa's badly burned around the arms
and hands. The engine was only dam
aged slightly.
SAN JOSE, May 14.â An explosion of
gas from an oil burning engine blew
off a portion of the roof of the round
house and badly burned John Reisllng,
a fireman, at the Southern Pacific
yards in this city last evening. The en
gine had just hauled a freight train
from San Francisco and had been
backed into the roundhouse. The oil
was turned off, but the suction of
crude oil when used with a patent
burner creates a gas. This gas had
completely filled the firebox and boiler
tubes.

As in the ;. Eastern church Lent ex
tends for forty-eight days before East
er, and the fast is most rigorous, its
observance will entail considerable suf
fering upon the Russian soldiers in
semi-arctic Manchuria. 1 All flesh must
be abstained from after Sexagesima
Sunday, and from the Monday in Quln
quageslma until Easter neither cheese
nor eggs may be eaten. Any Infringe
ment is severely regarded. For the
murder of his mother a moujlk was
sent to Siberia. On the way the con
vict gang halted 'at an inn for food.
It was Lent. . but the landlord; being
a Jew, brought out meat. "Dog of a
Jew!" swore the murderer; "I have
killed my mother, and I would kill
my father also rather than eat meat
in Lent."â New York Tribune.

The following will give somo Idea of
the new language! This is part of a
verb: Ami, to iove; amanta. loving;
amlnta, having loved ; amonta, about to
love; amata, being loved; amita, hav
ing been loved; ml amas, I love;' vl
amis, you loved; 11" amoa, he will love;
nl amus, we should love; ill estas am
ata, you are loved. These forms will
hardly strike the average reader as
any lovelier than those with which
they may be acquainted from old
grammars. It cannot be any. more
difficult to learn to say "amo," or "Ich
liebe," or "j'alme." than It Is to say
"ml amas." Then, In Esperanto, there
are other things, such as femlnines In
"in," diminutives In "et" and au in
troductory "cu" as a question mark.
"These particulars." we are told, "arc
particularly useful in constructing
words." For instance, "pll" means
"more." "Pli N bona" . is "better," "mal
pll bona" is "less good" and "pll mal
bona" "worse." "Ig" â¢ means the art
of making, -and bona Is "good"; so
"bonlgo" means "making good" and
"pll bonlgo," "making better** or "Im
provement."âNew York Press.

the late Emanuel Paget, widow of the
late Professor Paget, head of the
French department at the University

$23,444 56. She left a large part of her
estate to pay off debts assumed by her
husband during his life time, which
his family had been unable to pay
by reason of the Franco-Prussian war.
He spent his life In trying to pay off
these claims and at his death had been
unable to accomplish his desire. What
he failed to do his wife has now done
for him. What remains after these
debts are paid will go toward estab

Although few if any people had pre
dicted so early a termination of the
career of the "cotton market leader"
as that of yesterday, few experienced
financiers doubted that such an end
would eventually come. Certain Indica
tions in the career of "market leaders"
are unmistakable, and one Is the evi
dence that one success In a speculative
venture has led the lucky adventurer
to believe that his judgment was infal
lible and his luck impregnable.
The notable case in point that occur
red in May. 1S98, suggested the outcome
of the Sully operation. Even the "cot
ton clique's" achievement of January,
1904, must yield for dramatic interest
to the "Leiter" corner In wheat six
years before. The speculator who fig
ured In that episode bought wheat as
low as 65 cents a bushel. The short Eu
ropean supply and the Spanish war
came in to help him; he put the price
up on the 10th of May, 1898, to $1 85
per bushel. The newspapers chronicled
his movements, and serious articles
were written* (a foretaste of this year)
to show what "young Leiter had done
for the American farmer." It was the
burden of nearly all current comment
that no one had ever grasped the facts
of the market more Intelligently.
What young Leiter did was to pur
chase on borrowed money contracts re
quiring delivery of 35,000,000 bushels.
He sold a part, as Sully did of his,
and even after the 10th of May had
$5,000,000 clear paper profit to his credit.
On June- 13 he confessed Insolvency.
TJhe consumer had refused to keep on
buying, Â¦ but the corner manipulator
could not stop. His creditors, therefore,
found a way to make him do so. In
1898, as in 1904, news of -.he . failure
was called a "bolt from the blue." For
twenty-four hours no one could under
stand it. After that Interval, however,
every one remembered that he had pre
dicted It all along. . ?'3 y &?Â»
With Leiter, as with his more recent
Imitator in another market. It could be
said that he showed a fair comprehen
sion' of the conditions of- supply, very
great misunderstanding of the nature of
demand, and total inability to distin
guish the proper limits of the use of
credit. The moral Is so old that noth
ing; but a sensational case in point can
interest the Â¦ trained observer In it. â

It would seem from an account given
by a Kansas man that the Mexican
bull fight is considerable of a bluff,
that it does not require the skill, cour
age and agility to be a bull fighter that
most have believed. Frank Dibert of
Eureka was visiting in El" Paso and
went to a bull fight across the lines of
Juarez. For the Eureka Messenger he
writes a full description of what he
saw, concluding as follows:
"During the two hours' oort six
horses and seven bulls were engaged In
the fight and two horses and three bulls
were killed and quickly dragged from
the ring by a mule team. The eques
trian part of the sport was a roaring
farce, very much like Don. Quixote's
fight with the windmill. In the last
round of the bull fight an American
feature was Introduced that nearly took
our breath. An outer gate was thrown
open and free admission given to a
hundred boys ranging from 12 to 18
years of age, mostly El Paso kids. The
boys did not wait to enter the inner
gates leading to the arena, but swarm
ed over the fences into the bull ring
from every side. A fresh bull met the
boys in the center and semed dazed at
the dare-devil spirit of the American
kid. This was a feature of the bull
fight not advertised, and of which I
had never heard. However, the boys
exhibited more bravery and fearless
ness in tackling the big, wild, wiry
bull than the armef and trained bull
fighters.' They had no weapons but
their wamusacs and sombreros, with
which they teased and" pelted the bull.
Some of the smaller kids pulled the
bull's 1 tail, while others went close in
front and threw their coats over his
horns. They finally worried the bull so
much that he ran to the gate and bawl
ed to get out. The boys then actually,
called to the manager and pleaded for
a fresher and wilder bull." â Kansas

popples and red hawthorne In the hall an4
"den" giving a pleasing touch of color to the
rich furnishings. The score cards carried out

her cue yesterday from the tact that it was

EVENTS IN bOCIETY
In speaking of the conditions pre
vailing in the interior Sheriff Bishop
said:. "I found nothing to criticize in
the work of any of my deputies, and
the conditions in the Interior towns
are perfectly* satisfactory. The officers
are as a rule well liked and have little
difficulty in keeping the peace without
trouble. My only reason for Inspect
ing the offices of the deputies is that
they may not become lax In the per
formance of their duties."
Sheriff John N. Bishop has inaugu
rated a system of semi-annual inspec
tions of the towns and districts in the
Interior of the county which are un
der the immediate jurisdiction of his
deputies and he has Just returned from
a trip through the county. The Sheriff
holds that as the policing of the great
er part of Alameda County- devolves
upon the Sheriff's office the work of
the deputies should be kejVt up" to the
highest possible standard. He be
lieves that this can be best ac
complished by a personal, inspection,
and to this end has \ introduced the
new system.

OAKLAND, May 14. â Congressman
Victor H. Metcalf arrived at his home
here from "Washington this evening
greatly Improved In health after his
recent illness. Both he and Mrs. Met
calf express themselves as being de
lighted to get back and are in the best
of spirits. They were at St. Louis for
a few days to view the World's Fair
and speak In high praise of the show
ing that Alameda County has made
there by its display.
Congressman Metcalf was very tired
after his Journey, but he found time to
say that the last session of Congress
had not been without results and that
next year would see the fruits borne
by the work which had been done. In
speaking of the improvement of Oak
land harbor he said: "Senator Per
kins and myself have the assurance
of General McKenzie, chief engineer
of the War Department, of an addi
tional survey of the harbor calling
for a depth of 25 feet by 500 feet in
width to Fulton street. This means a
great deal for Oakland, aa it will ad
mit of deep water ships coming right
up to our wharves. The work now
under way will be continued until we
can get another appropriation next
winter.
"At St. Louis I was specially In
terested in Alameda County's exhibit
and cannot say too strongly of what
has been done there. California has
one of the most striking displays in
the Liberal Arts building. Of course
Kansas and Missouri have made spe
cial effort*, but California will hold
its own."
Simon, with a number of compan
ions, had been spending New Year's
night drinking in the saloons of Lorin.
Shortly after midnight they engaged
in a Quarrel over unionism and All
eeits was shot. He afterward recov
ered. None of the witnesses, how
ever, were able to give a clear account
of who was to blame for the affair and
after spending two days in listening
to the testimony Judge Melvin brought
the trial to a close this afternoon.
Otto Simon was acquitted this after
noon of the shooting of Meinrath All
seits. Judge Melvin held that the tes
timony was of such a contradictory
character that legally there was no
ground for a conviction.

The burglar practices the same dis
crimination at all his visit* He got
into Hoessli's place last night by pry
ing open a window that leads Into the

abstract goods from beneath the coun

bery was not discovered until the pro
prietor arrived this morning to open
his Ftore.
The police are of the opinion that
the burglar is familiar with the town
and the places he robs. He is sup
posed to be the man at whom Officer
George Thompson took a shot one
night a month aco.

Oregon Potatoes continued to arrive freely
and the market was quiet and weak with
buytrs holding: off In hopes of forcing holders
to reduce their quotations. The latter were
firm in their views, and, predicting a better
market, refused to concede to buyers. Strict
ly fancy lots of new Potatoes brought a slight
advance, but the market -generally waa weak,
despite some inquiry for shipping. Red
Onlorut were also in demand for shipment to
Puget Sound, but as receipts were very heavy,
prices had a further decline.
Nearly all descriptions of miscellaneous
vegetables were in free supply and prices ot

there was a steady * Inquiry for shipment on

CHICAGO, May 11.â A firm tone was mani
fest :-d in wheat at the opening, decreased ship
ments from Australia and reports of drouth
in the Danubian territory being largely re
sponsible for the improved sentiment. Initial
Bal^s on July were He lower to 4c higher at
Sa*46Slc. Shorts were fairly active bidders
at the start, but offerings were rather limited
and on that account a moderate advance In
prices was made. July sold up to S4Uc. The
weather was cool in the West, with light
fronts at many points and this had consider
able to do with the early firmness. A number
of -bearish reports were received from the
Southwest later in the day, causing quite gen
eral selling, under the influence of which July
declined to S34fcS3Hc. A rally followed
on covering by shorts, who were some
what disturbed over predictions of a liberal
decrease In the visible supply. The market
closed with an Inclination to firmness, final
quotations on July being at S't^SxS-Msc.
The early corn market was strong on an
active commission house demand, the large
cash business of yesterday, together with small
local receipts being the chief incentives to
buying. The market closed weak, with July
4c lower at 47Vt@47%c.
An easier feeling in oats late in the session
was due almost entirely to weakness in corn.
July oats closed Â»Â»c lower at 38H@38?gC.

Trade in the fruit market was quite active,
as local retailers were stocking up tor the Sun
day trade and a good demand was noted for
shipment to Puget Sound por;a on the steamer
which leaves to-day. Receipts of Cherries
were 5S0 boxes and included several consign
ments of small- white -fruit, which could not
be sold even at the minimum quotation. The
top quotation was an extreme for one favored
brand, $1 being about the top for the general
market. Apricots were firmer, although re
ceipts continued liberal. Receipts of Straw
berries were over 1100 chests and the large
varieties, which constituted the bulk of the re
ceipts, were quoted lower. Surplus lots wers
cleaned up at the minimum quotation, but tha
ruling prices were $3ii4 per chest. A wagon
loaded with Longworths from Palo Alto met
with an accident near the railroad yards and
was overturned. There were about 35 . chests
on the wagon and they were scattered about,
and what were saved had to be sold below the
quotations. The accident netted the con
signees a loss of about $200. Raspberries from
the south sold at 2n'(i25c. and Dewberries at
10c per small basket. Strawberries from
Florin were offering freely at SOc per crate,
but moved slowly, owing to the abundance and
low prices of superior quality offerings from
other sections. Gooseberries appeared from the
river and sold at 15Â«a25c per pound. Oranges
ruled firm, with all dealers reporting a good
demand for all grades. A half crate of red
Currants came In from San Leandro and sold
for ?1.

An historic oak sapling was planted

Secretary Hitchcock supplied the' tree,

Many years ago Charles Sumner sent
to the Czar of Russia some acorns from
a stately . oak which overhangs, the
tomb of Washington at Mount Vernon.
The -Czar caused the acorns "to '', be

acorns grew into .a magnificent oak,
which yet stands in the palace grounds.
I While in St. Petersburg, in 1S98 as

Virginia does not want her school
masters to drink, and a bill to that
effect is now before the Legislature.
Their need of a high ball or anything
of the kind Is to be determined by
a doctor of medicine and not by their
private interior yearnings and they
must show a prescription before any
tavern or saloon keeper is empowered
to give them one. If they violate the
ordinance they are to.be removed and
if the trustees fail to carry this out
they are to be fined for dereliction.
The old commonwealth Is very much
in earnest in the matter, convinced
that the general run of its teachers
have taken "sugar in theirn" quite

Th raising of hyacinth, tulip and daf
fodil bulbs is practically a Dutch mo
nopoly, and nearly all of those bulbs
sold by American seed houses are Im
portations. John VandenneiJ, repre
sentative In the United States of a bulb
house at Llsse, Holland, who arrived in
New York recently, has for his only
samples a few dozen bulbs, but he says
that In every greenhouse in the coun
try he can point to the blossom product
of the bulbs which he sells. Mr. Van
dermeij talks interestingly about the
business of growing hyacinth bulbs.
"They will not grow in every coun
try," he declared. "In fact, Holland is
the only land in which bulb raising has
become a large and distinct Industry.
A dry, sandy soil and even climatic
conditions are essential to the full de
velopment of the hyacinth, tulip and
daffodil. I believe, however, that daf
fodils are grown with some degree of
success in the southern part of Vir
ginia. But as an exclusive business the
United States cannot lay claim to daf
fodil farming.
"In this country the changes of cli
mate do not agree with these plants.
The bulbs must be set in the fall, cov
ered so as to maintain an even tem
perature throughout the winter, and In
the sprin'g, when the blossoming time
Is at hand, rainfall, sunshine and mild
ness m/st occur with absolute regu
larity. Otherwise no bulbs will nil out.
Of course, the blossoms trill unfold aa
beautifully here as In Holland, but the
developing process ends with, the fall
of the petals.
"I believe that few lovers of flowers
know that the tulip and hyacinth, so
common In the American home, are
not natives. I have even heard Ignor
ance on tMs point attain to such pro
portions "as to Inspire pscudo flower
fanciers In the United States to sug
gest the . tulip as a national emblem.
Even if it were physically possible to
raise good tulip bulbs here I do not be
lieve that an Industry could be built
up in the face of Dutch competition.
Labor is cheap with us, and we can ex
port bulbs and place them on the mar- t
ket at a lower figure than could be
fixed by American growers."
Bulb Raising With them Is a Dis
tinct Industry of Large
, Proportions.
In a recent Issue of Electricity there
appeared an article taken from one of
the daily papers describing an inven
tion for generating electridtf direct
from fueL The inventor, a resident of
Newark, N. J., Is elated, aa he deems
his invention perfected. This problem
of obtaining power direct from coal
and doing away with expensive and
cumbrous machinery Is one that in
ventors and scientists the world over
have been for years endeavoring to

cessfully and designs an apparatus
that is practical will be the means of
revolutionizing the existing methods of
generating motive power. But unless
thjs Newark genius has finally hit upon
the proper combination of elements the
problem Is far from solved. Thermo
piles have been brought out In the past,
for which great things were hoped and
which to all appearances accomplished
striking results In a small way. When,
however, more was required of them
than the operation of an electric fan
or a doorbell, fatal defects made their
appearance. The Internal resistance
was too great and the alloys made use
of became oxidized. The Newark in
ventor claims that the efficiency of his
apparatus, which he calls a dynelec
tron, is 45 per cent as compared to 8^
per cent when electric current Is gen
erated by means of the steam engine.
It is to be hoped that Ihe dynelectron
will be able to accomplish what the
steam engine and dynamo now does
not! but until such Is actually proven
t& be the case we â¢ are inclined to be
rather skeptical of the ability this

The greater part of his dally duties
consists of reading off pay checks, and
he keeps two clerks busy checking off
.the^ayrolls and ten clerks equally busy
making out the checks. The work is
one that requires absolute accuracy,
the slightest mistake meaning a loss In
dollars find cents,' and since he has
been thus employed Conway has made
but one slight error. The pay checks
read by Conway one month recently
totaled 42,000, and this was done with
out a single error. The checks are
written by ten different clerks and, of
course, are in â ten entirely different
styles of writing. This is one of the
most important particulars to be con
sidered in order to realize Conway's
accomplishment. "Were the checks all
written In the same hand the reader
would soon become accustomed , to the
style and learn to read it as readily' as
printed words, but the different checks
are so mixed that almost every one he
reads is made out in handwriting.dif
ferent from the preceding, one. The
proper reading of each check Involves
the pronunciation of from twenty to
twenty-four words, and Conway says
that he can read about 1300 checks an
hour. As has bÂ»n explained, however,
the4readlng of the check requires great
care and accuracy, and is very differ
ent from "sight j reading of a . book or
newspaper as a featf Another thing to
be taken into consideration la the great
variety of names that he is called on
to". "decipher and pronounce In reading

Conway's claim for unparalleled
rapidity of speech Is almost incredible,
but hundreds of friends can testify as
to his wonderful vocal powers. He says
that by actual count he can speak at
the rate of 1084 words a minute, or
about eighteen words a second. Â¦-' Jj
Conway claims that he can talk 63,040
words an hour, and that he can and
has talked Incessantly- eight hours a
day for nine consecutive days without
any ill effects. He also expresses the
belief that he can exceed this remark
able record, -j
In addltloYi to his remarkable rapid
ity of speech Conway's voice has a
range of nearly four octaves, the aver

about two octaves. S

The truth is that the Russian peas

death. His average earnings in the
central provinces are 17 and 18 ko
pecks (8 to 9 cents) a day through
out of the year; during the busiest har
! vest time they rise to an average of
27 to 36 kopecks (13 to 16 cents) a day;
.during the whole .. winter _he and his
family, earn nothing. His "diet con
sists of meal, flour and grits, cabbage
and potatoes; no meat, excepting three

IT IS FREE WITH NEXT SUNDAY'S GALL
<4 In the Pasture."
"In the Pasture," by Julien Jos, presents a rare combination of pictorial and artistic qualities.
In it the artist has displayed exceptional. ability in three directionsâ as a landscapist, a figure painter
and an animal painter. His varied talents are so evenly balanced and so harmoniously combined in
this picture that it would be a difficult matter to decide which he has painted best â the cattle, the
young peasant woman who is caring for their wants or the landscape which serves as a setting for
both. It has 'other qualities which are not the result of the artist's skill as a painter, but which
are the expression of his thought and feeling.
There is a vieor and brilliancy to be observed in the effect of sunlight, and he has jrfven a
vivacity to the movements of the animals and the action of the figure.
In the' grass and foliage of the landscape there is abundant detail, but it is painted with a frank.
sure touch, free from any suggestion of labored uncertainty in his methods of painting. All this com-
bines to give in the picture an agreeable effect of truth and lifelikeness.
The cattle are oarticularly well drawn and painted.
It has been said that pictures of horses are less apt to^ please than representations of 'cattle
or sheep, for the reason that horses are generally more closely observed by the public, and defects
in the drawing of these animals are more quickly noted, while in paintings of cattle such defects are
overlooked, provided there is agreeable color and a picturesque quality of roughness in the painting
to conceal them. ,
In this painting by Julien Jos there has been no attempt to avoid difficulties. Forms are well
denned, values are truthful and colors wejl observed. There is evidence everywhere of the
artist's comprehensive study, from the blades of grass in the foreground to details of the figure
and the animals.
There is a satisfying sense of completeness, and yet he has shown how to subordinate part*
of his picture to gain unity of subject-
It is scientific, rather than emotional painting, and yet is not lacking in feeling and spirit.
Julien Jos is a native of Belgium and has his studio in Brussels. He is a pupil of the cele-
brated cattle painter, Franz de Beul, and is, to some extent, a follower of Julien Dupre:
He was awarded a silver medal at the Brussels Universal Exposition and medals at exhibi-
tions, held in Ghent, Antwerp and other European cities. His work is almost as well known and
appreciated in America as in Europe.A person usually begins to lose
height at the age of SO, and at the age
of 90 has lost at least one and a half
inches. , - _

immediately got It and then determined
upon making the arrest. ' He had
learned . considerable about Hauser,
whom he had shadowed, and to-day
v.'hen he began to talk to him he soon
had Hauser. completely in' his meshes.
"Hauser is a man of ' steady habits
and saving, but In a moment of weak
ness gave way to the temptation of
fered him. He made his thefts by gath
! ering up' the "shot," as they are called,
I that splashed from the melted ' gold.
When he left the building "he put a
ccuplc of them in his mouth and in
three or four months' savings he. had
| enough to make a bar worth about
I 5200. He said he could not account for
his having begun his operations and
Eaid that he had never stolen anything
before In his life, but he took advan
; tage of his opportunities and imagined
himself perfectly secure. When he sold
.the first bar, however, he said that he
' was frightened for several days. The
same feeling came over him when he
i sold the second' bar. He then deter
j mined to stop and broke up his little
'. dentist's melting pot in which he re
. duced his gatherings into a bar."

For many years there have been com
plaints from mining: men throughout
California, Arizona and Mexico at the
returns received for the gold shipped to
the San Francisco Mint. There is a
slamming: charge, varying from 525 to
$100 on every considerable amount of
Reid sold there. It is said that no mat
ter how carefully a brick is cleaned at
the mines, the skimming charge is al
vays made in proportion to the weight
of the pold. Most of the large shippers
of gold prefer to send their bricks to
some private smelting company, and
claim that generally they receive more
Ci-tlsfactory returns.
HOW COLD IS TAKEN.
There is no way of ascertaining how
much Hauser has stolen during his
brief employment at the Mint. Though
only {400 in gold was traced to him, it
is believed that a much larger sum was
peddled by his agents at places where
recovery was impossible. In his con
fession he stated that in skimming the
gold sent to the Mint for sale he would
include a certain amount of gold while
dipping off the slag, and that subse
quently he would extract these globules
â¢and take home. There he had a
crucible, and he would remelt the
globules into bars, adding an amount
of silver sufficient to disguise the gold
from the supposition that it came from
the Mint. All minted gold of the United
States currency is utterly without sil
ver, but has a small percentage of cop
per alloy to secure it against erosion.
- Yesterday afternoon Burns was
â¢ ailed Into the case by Superintendent
lx;ach of the Mint. Burns waited un
til Hauser quit his work and then
Â¦placed him under arrest. He took him
Into Superintendent Leach's office and
before he had finished the interview
Hauser had made a complete confes
sion and restored 5400, which he said
was the entire amount of his pecula
tions. Then he was taken in charge
l>y Secret Service Agent Hazen and
placed in the City Prison pending his
preliminary hearing.
AMOUNT IS UNCERTAIN*.
Another scanai! !n the San Fran
cisco Mint has broken out. Dimmick
and his theft of JS0.000 have scarcely
passed from the public mind before It
has been conclusively proved that at
le&st one of the melters h*s been sya
tematlcally stealing since August la?t,
when he first went into the employ of
the Mint The name of the latest
criminal is Albert Hauser and he waa
arrested late j-esterday afternoon by
Secret Service Agent William J. Burns.
After a two hours' interview with the
famous secret service man Hauser
confersed to the theft of MOO worth of
gold in the skimming process and
made restitution. This \ras the entire
amount recovered by George W. Haxen,
head of the local United States secret
service fore* and his assistant, Thomas
Foster. They had worked on the case
for months and ascertained that gold
v.-as being sold to various buyers by an
'utrent of Hauser. The case against
Hauser was weak and they feared to
urrest him.
