offered by . the ' * Chhie? e' Govern
ment for â¢ the "surrender of \u25a0 ;the
concession for 'building the..Canton-
Harikbw Railroad, now held, by J/P.

gian associates. It now remains for
the directors of the China- American
Development Company, in which Mo'rr
gan has a controlling interest, to act
upon the matter at a.meeting to be held
in New Tork early in July. .. . . :
China gave the concession to :. the
American. company in 1897. Only twen
ty-two miles of the railroad have been
built. China complains that the meth
ods of the company have caused , the
Chinese to lose faith in this -particular
enterprise. China has paid to the com
pany several millions of dollars in Chi
nese Government bonds at 90. A por
tion of these bonds were, sold; by the
company, but the majority are now held
by .Morgaji. and his associates. ', If the
deal is closed these bonds wilube de
livered to'the- Chinese Government. It
Is thought not improbable that the Bel

may be- loth to" surrender- the conces

about disorders which v.-ould be par

Probably" It wasn't, but if anybody
else on board had expressed that opin
ion of the imperial exhortation- there
would, probably have' been trouble. The
captain concluded that It "was. one; of
those rare occasions . when 'a 'subject
might safely venture to disagree with
his sovereign.. '

The Emperor rules Germany, but eti
quette rules him. No feminine "aspirant
for social honors is a greater ; slave to
the dictates'; of fashion;, 'than" Is the
Kaiser to the regulationsjofthe>artifi

to "yield obedience.'? Nearly eyery.'f unc-,

The fourth photograph differs from
the other three in that it portrays the
Kaiser in one of his favorite imperial
roles â that of. the inspired preacher.
But perhaps equal interest attaches to
It because It is the first time that he
has permitted himself to be thus pic
tured. Of the thousand odd photo
graphs of him extant none has ever be
fore shown him at the altar. In th!s
one he is depicted holding Sunday ser
vice on board the Hohenzollern, with
the Empress and one of her ladies-in
walting Bitting immediately in front of
tTie flag-draped pulpit, with the officers
and crew of the yacht grouped all
around. When the Kaiser preaches he
appears in his capacity as official head
of the state Evangelical church,
which, of course, gives him the right
to assume the functions of .the minister
whenever .and as often as he likes.
The Lutheran church party is said to
be incensed at the circulation, of this
particular view, regarding it as a bit
"stagy" and spectacular. The rank and
file of the religious party have never
taken kindly to the idea of thÂ« Kaiser
as a pulpiteer, though it is admitted
that he preaches quite as well as most
doctors of divinity, and aside from the
tendency to make .too much of the texts
that inculcate obedience to ths powers
that be, he is pretty sound on doctrine.
Ordinarily he takes a very serious view
of his functions as a preacher' and has
had some volumes of his . sermons
printed that all Germany may profit by
them. But even as a preacher he. has
his off days on the Hohenzollern. On
one occasion- one of the sailors was so'
unmindful of the inestimable privilege
conferred upon him that he fell asleep
in the midst of one of the Kaiser's
pious orations. For this heinous of
fense the captain sentenced him to be
locked up ' for two days and put on
short rations. ', '. .
"Was he on watch last night?" asked
the Emperor.
"Ho was, your Majesty," replied the
captain. - â :- - \u25a0

It'is only when he is afloat that the
Kaiser is really able to 'shake off the
tyrannous . rule by which he is domi
nated on shore. It is that which makes
him enjoy so much his trips on the Ho
henzollern. -It is then the natural man
in him has a chance to show himself
and he Is seen at his best. Ab soon as
deep sea soundings y are reached, all
court ceremonial is chucked overboard.
Instead of wrestling through a . half
dozen uniforms, as uncomfortable as
they, are imposing, the Emperor sticks
it out all day in the same rig, generally
a suit of loose-fitting flannels without
any fancy, fixings? j He hobnobs freely
with' his guests, the members of '"his
suite and the officers of his yacht. He
chats with them,. argues .with 'them,
chaffs them. . He" is the life and soul of
every joke and discussion and sets >th'e
pace for conviviality and companion
ship. At meals all his guests and staff
s,it down with him iand.:; pretty much
where ..they-, please. . AH formality -is
abandoned. JThere â¢is none of the ; re
straint that is usually imposed by 'the
presence of royalty. The. Kaiser makes

time and -that, he wants 'everybody to

If the person so applying is a merchant, the
certificate must state, in addition to the above
requirements, the nature or character and esti

aforesaid. If the certificate be sought for the
purpose of travel for curiosity, it mast also

law further provides as follows: >â¢"'
"The certificate provided for la this act and
the identity of the person named therein shall,
before such person goes on board any vessel to
proceed to the United State*." be . vised by the
Indorsement of the diplomatic representative of

Although neither the treaty nor the laws
make provisions- in. terms for. the extension of
transit privileges to laborers, such privileges
are, aa a matter of fact, accorded Chinese la
bcrers by regulation of. the department. That
Is to say, exercising the general authority con
ferred by law to enact regulations, the depart
ment permits Chinis* laboters to pass through
the country under suitable "^ restrictions and
' proper safeguards. \u25a0â¢\u0084 â¢ ; **
No specmc. regulation haa. thus far been
deemed necessary In order to extend transit

cord 'when in possession" or the section 6 cer

HARSH TREATMENT. .OF EXEMPTS;
As to the harsh atid unreasonable treatment
which, it is said, â¢ has been accorded members
of the exempt classes, this much may be said:
What are known, as Section \u25a0Â«â¢ certificates
were universally^ accepted and the landing of
Chinese subjects possessing them facilitated in
every way. until it .became apparent to the ; of
ficers of the service that these certificates were
being issued by .hundreds to Chinese . laborers
and other persons not entitled to them under
the law. In order. to administer the law it
then became , necessary to Investigate' each In
dividual case as by. law authorised. A .
It is, of course-, possible that the officers of
the service. Avtre' overzealous In their, efforts
to prevent the entry of Chinese laborers, on
fraudulent certificates. But the fact' remains
that the source of the trouble was the lax
methods of . the Chinese and other officials
charged with issuing and vising these certifi
cates.
So much as to the conditions. As to the
remedy, 1 have the honor to recommend that
there be issued to the diplomatic representa
tives of the United States In China instruc
tions that, before they vise certificates, they
comply strictly with thÂ» requirements of that
portion of section 6 which provides aa follows:
"And such diplomatic representatives ..or
consular representative whose Indorsement 13
bo required Is hereby empowered and it shall
be'his duty before indorsing such certificate as
aforesaid to examine into the - truth of the
statements set forth in said certificate and if
he shall find on examination that said certifi
cate or"' any *â¢ of \u25a0 the â¢"Â» statements contained
thereln^aw untrue lt ; shall be hla duty to re
fuse to indorse same." \u25a0 \u25a0
In keeping with this suggestion I. hare the
hbtior,to advise -you that I shall issue Instruc
tions' to^ the- officers -of ' the service to facill
\u25a0\u25a0 tate the landing of aH Chinese subjects in pos
session of euch certificates. In this connection
I Invite your attention to a class of Chinese
subjects who are neither laborers on the one
hand nor : teachers, students, merchants or
travelers on the . othsrâ such, for instance, as
doctor*, lawyers, clergymen, etc. \v hlle tfte
department Is without authority In the ab
sence of appropriate legislation to extend to
members of this latter class the same privi
leges which are now by law extended to teach
ers, students, merchants and travelers, yet It Is
clearly within the power of the department to
extend to. them the privilege of transit, under
suitable regulations. This the department will
do at an. early date. .' Respectfully,

The . attention of all officers charged with
the enforcement of the Chinese exclusion laws
is directed to department circular 80.
Issued under, date -of June 24, 1805. Under
the provisions of the treaty and law* In â¢ re
lation to * the exclusion of Chinese persons,
officials of the Chinese Government and. teach
i ers students. '.; merchants, . travelers .. . for
curiosity 4or ' pleasure and : the lawful wives
and minor children when la possession of the
certificates- feqnlred by sectlonr 6 of the act
of July 5. ISS4.' must be accorded alt. the
rights," /privileges -and "Immunity and- exemp
tions which are accorded to the citizens . and
subjects of the most favored nation.
Attention 1Â» also called to the fact that,
under rule 12. Chinese,- persons, other than
laborers ' not supplied with the certificates
provtded- for by section B ofXhe act ot July
fv 1884 \u25a0 rai'v: be ; permitted to \u25a0 f>a?s through
the United States in transit upon produciag
to the' offlceis in charge of the enforc*mÂ»Kf
of th# "Chinese exclusion law: at the port of
arrival such"- reasonable proof 'as -may. be re
quired to satisfy him that a bona fide transit
only Is intended. Attftntlon iÂ» especially called
to the fact that . Chinese persons, other than
laborer?, in possÂ«sslon of a section 8 certificate
are ; not required to give bond or furnish a
photograph- or submit to the physical exami
nation required by the Bertlllloa Â«ystem of
Identification, i- " \u25a0 \u25a0"". " ' '
;. The purpose of the" Chtnese exclusion law
is to prevent the immigration of Chinese labor
i ers and -not- to â¢\u25a0 restrict the freedom of. move-
bor. that, while laborers must be strictly ex
cluded, the: law: must j be-., enforced .without
harshness and that all unnecessary - inconveni
ence and annoyance toward thos; persons en
titled' to enter 'the. United"- States .' must -be
scrupulously avoided.' 'The officials of the Im
migration Department have been told that no
harshness in the administration of the law
will for a moment be tolerated, and that any
discourtesy, shown to Chinese persons by. any
official- of the Government- will, be cause ior
Immediate dismissal trom'the service.
Th- status of those Chinese entitled freely to
enter the. ..United States is primarily deter
mined by "the certificate ; provided 'tor' under
section Â« of. the act of Congress, July 5, 1884.
Under this -law the diplomatic t and consular
representatives of the United States' have, by
direction of the President, been instructed, be
tore viselne any certificate,: : strictly. tq comply
to ihe requirements of that portion of section
6 which; urovldes cs follows: '*
. "Ana such diplomatic representatives or con
sular j representative whose Indorsement Is so
requirtd .Is thereby empowered and It shall be.
his duty, beiore ; indorsing such certificates as
aforesaid \u25a0 to examine :'into the truth of the
statements set forth In. said certificates, and
if he rhall- find upon examination that salu
or any o( the statements therein contatntd are
untrue it shall be'his duty; to refuse to In
dorse the same." â¢ -.- , .
The certificate thus vised, becomes -prlma
facie evidence of the facu set forth therein.
Tha Immigration officials have now been spe
cifically instructed to accept these certificates
which -are not to be upset unless good reason
can -be shown for so doing. .
Unfortunately. In the past it has bien found
that oinclals of the ttilnese Government have
recklessly Issued thousands of such certificates
which were not true; and .recklessness has
also beÂ»n shown- in the past by WWOjaUj^
of .the American consular service in^iseing
these certificates. The purpose Â°f }h>s Gov
ernment is to make these vised certlflca tes of
such real valub tnat It Is safe to acj e"PÂ« Â»h era
here in the United States. This will result in
dofng away with most of the causes of com

They muni not lÂ»sue nny nucbjeertlfl

to it and they will be held to a most

there Is reason to believe that any cer

Ist bcine Improperly used, a thorough
InveatlKatlon will be -made Into Itsj

In three of these interesting photo
graphs he has permitted himself to be
paraded before the public In^ anything
but an exalted attitude. He appears as
a very human sort of being. They are
the Kaiser's answer to the accusation
that he Is- too much addicted to the
pomps and vanities of the world. One
of the photographs shows the monarch,
who is popularly supposed . to r oc
cupy himself only with big things,
making his favorite dog, Fritz, a dachs
hund, sit up and "speak" for a tit-bit
held in the imperial right hand. The
circulation of such a photograph" as
that a few years ago would have been
sternly forbidden and any photographer
who disregarded the prohibition would
have been held guilty of "lese majeste"
of the worst kind and sent to Jail to
meditate. on the folly of trifling with
the dignity of the Lord's anointed.
It Is something: more than a coinci
dence that the attack has been followed
by the circulation of four of the most
intimate photographs of the Kaiser that
have ever been permitted to reach the
public They were taken on board the
Hohenzollern during the trip which fur
nished the excuse for criticizing him for
putting 1 on so much style. They are
now on sale in Berlin and throughout
the country in. picture postcard form
and are attracting an enormous amount
of attention, for they show his strenu
ous Majesty in a state of democratic re
pose and simplicity in which he has
never before been revealed to his loyal
subjects.
HIS ' ATTITUDE XOT EXALTED.
What imparts peculiar significance to
their appearance is the fact that no
photographs of the Emperor are ever
permitted to be offered for sale in Ger
many without his express permission.
The public were familiar enough with
photographs of him showing him as a
war lord, as a modern viking or filling
various other masterful roles, and all of
them calculated to impress the be
holder with his immeasurable superior
ity to the ordinary mortal. They lent
currency to the story that he wore a
sword in the bath tub and had epau
lettes on his night shirts.
BERLIN. Junc.2s.â At the conclusion
of the German Emperor's recent spec
tacular tour of the Mediterranean in his
own private warship, the Hohenzollern,
one of the most influential papers in the
capital published an article deploring
ihe constant round of state Journeys and
festivities which occupy most of the
Kaiser's time. The writer intimated
that the pomp, luxury and extrava
gance associated with the Emperor set
a bad example to his people, and fur
ther, was destrustive of that Spartan
simplicity of character which best fit
ted the ideal of a German ruler. The
article was, â¢of course, a veiled attack
on the Kaiser himself, but so cleverly
was it done that the writer could not be
hauled up for "lese majeste." Where
his Imperial Majesty, is the subject of
discussion German scribes have become
adepts at tire sort of writing whose
meaning is disclosed in what is read be
tween the lines.

You
Get Up
In the morning tired, languid,
and frequently with a headache
that is almost unbearable. You
have been nervous, restless and
c sleepless night after, night, and
gloomy and" irritable during
the day. This nervous exhaus-
tion affects the heart, lungs and
other organs that depend upon
the nerves for motive power.
.Then the stomach fails to di-- 1
gest the food ; the heart action
is weak, and circulation poor,
and the kidneys 'and liver in-
active. . â¢Â£..
What you need is not a stom-
ach, head, kidney or liver med-
icine, but Dr. Miles' Nervine to
soothe and feed the nerves and
build nerve tissue.
"My wife was subject to severe men-
tal strain, which resulted in nervous
prostration. The first symptoms were
uncontrollable crying and melancholy
spells, nhich increased to such an ex-
tent that for over a year she would
have a spell every day of from four
to six hours deration. She required
the constant attention of her physic-
ian and attendants. She suffer**, great
pain aid anguish. The best physicians
attending hÂ«r could rive no reliftf. and
ehe finally became almost of unsound
mind. As a last resort I uecan giving
her Dr. files' Nervine, and Tonic, and
noticed that her spells next day were
not so severe, and they gradually dis-
appeared altogether. She has had no 1
recurrence of the spells, and is gain- I
â¢ ing in health nnd strength. j

the controversial . point in the cburch

formation of governing bodies destined
to take over, control of the churches,
the debate was practically concluded.
The basis of reform, including the cut

Theodore Kaphan,' a waiter living at
1220 Folsom street, was held up 'by a
masked footpad with a revolver on
Eighth street, between Mission and
Howard, about 2 o'clock yesterday
morning and his purse, containing $s 76
was taken from him. The footpad's
coolness showed he was not new to
the business. . .
HELD VP BY JUASKED FOOTPAD.
While two burglars were ransacking the
nous* of .Mrs. W. O'Connor of 123 Her
mann street early Saturday evening they
were surprised in their work by the entry
of the two daughters. Misses Winifred
ana Frances O'Connor. The men stood
Mf.l in (he -dark dining-room with the
evident intention of retreating undiscov
ered, but in searching fcr a match with
which to lipht ilie gas Miss Winifred ac
cidentally gracyed the larger one by the
hair. Hcrror-strvck, she, was about to
yell to. her sister to run for a policeman,
but her attc-mpt to scream ended in a
stifled sob, fcr one of the burglars
grabbed her about the waist and forced
a handkerchief gag. into her mouth. In
the .meantime the other seized her purse
containing $IS and forced three rings from
her hand. Miss Frances had heard the
noise and ran to the street below
fcr help. It was ten minutes later when
the . reinforcements arrived and the
burglars had disappeared. They found
Mfas Winifred choked and fainting. The
only clew left behind was a marked
handkerchief.
The young ladies give a graphic ac
count of what happened. They had gone
out calling and were returning about
10:30 in the evening, never suspecting
what was in store for them. Their flat
is on tho third floor and Miss Winifred
was fifteen or. twenty feet ahead of her
sister. At the top of the stairs she heard
a foots-tep, but thought nothing of It. She
was dressed In white and must have been
plainly visible to the burglars. As she
reached for a match she felt a man's
head. It was then that she started to
scream and was choked. Then "she must
have' tainted. When she recovered con
Â£c!ou*neÂ« Bhs was lying on the sofa in
ihf fiont room, where the men had evi
dently carried her. She remembers that
in her fright she tried to â¢ save the rings,
one of which, a diamond, was borrowed,
but the cruel wrenching of the robber
tore them from her hand.
Mrs. O'Connor is a nurse. She was at
work only a block away at the time of
the robbery. The two young ladies are
employed in the Standard Shirt Company
and the $1* was the amount of Miss Wini
fred's weekly earnings. -This same house
was entered in May and $50 in cash taken
by unknown persons.
Even n:orÂ«? rtarmp -was the robbery of
Mrs. Carrie Wtlls r>f Â£44 Mission^ street by
Louis L. Lewis, a porter, on Mission
street, between Fourth and Fifth, short
ly before midnight on Saturday. Cap
tain Spil'ane and Lieutenant Cunboy were
pJose by at the time, besides Policemen
J. E. Dolan and M. J. Cullnan. ThÂ»y
were all attracted by the woman's
screams. Lewis havir..- struck her and
forcibly taken from her a gold watch
and purw. As he ran toward Fourth
streft Culinan intercepted him, but he
dodged past Cullnan and ran across the
street, where Spil'.anc and Conboy were
standing. Spillane saw him coming and
put out his foot to trip him up as he
nassrd. When within a few yards ; of
Spillane Policeman Dolan pounced upon
Lewis and held him. The stolen watch
whs found in his pocket, but he had

riety of grape at Fresno, In the hope
of demonstrating that it can resist the
Anaheim disease. N. B. Pierce, an ex
pert on viticulture connected with the
United States Department of Agricul
ture, had made the statement that this
variety was best for resisting the Ana
heim disease. The Anaheim disease has
been a subject of/ special study by, Mr.
Pierce for twenty years. Professor "Bi

easy a victim of the Anaheim disease
as any .other variety. Mr. Pierce has
admitted.. in a letter to Bioletti, his in
ability to find a' cure for the. disease or
to determine Its cause. ProfessorjÃio
letti will now experiment with hybrid
plants In the hope of finding or devel
oping.a variety that will not be sus
ceptible to the Anaheim malady.

upon vines that produce the Flame
Tokay grape, an imported variety, at
Florin, and will leave next week to
investigate the operations of the insect.
E. F. French, a, vineyardlst at Florin,
who has watched this beetle for fif
teen years, says he believes the pest
is responsible for berries dropping off
the vine, tb,e insects eating the berry
stems, so that the stems dry before the
berries are ripe and the fruit falls off

look about it.'- As for Chief Hodgkins,
he is eloquent; in his silence.
"Arid \ what was worse, the offending
policeman * was none other than Patrol
man McCready." Alas, the Irony of fate!
Only-a'few weeks ago the, Chief of Po
lfce. had' selected iMcCready to be" pro
moted' to the *; post of bailiff of Police
Coiirt: No. 2, one of the "easy" billets
that -serve" as targets -'for : ambitious
bluecoats' hopes. It was because of Me-
Cready's zeal . arresting ; violators of
the bicycle ordinance that the Chief of
Police had] picked ; the busy : policeman
for the honor."- And no w .; the shock
blasts "the Chief, and, according to the
wise ones at headquarters, has left Me-,
Cready in-a-guessing mood, f
It was in ; this wise. Last . night Mc-
Cready was ;6n the alert for careless
wheelmen when he spied a stalwart bi
cyclist on a Grove-street sidewalk/.The
policeman overhauled the rider and ar
rested him.Â» It was not revealed to the
officer 'that, he had touched; a .tender
spot until". after the prisoner had been
registered at the City Hall. * There the
record showed ; that A. L. Hodgkins,
machinist, had violated the or
dinance 2 and had been released on $2

ness property, of. the- present' year will
be closed by the Layrnance; Real Es
tate Company, and when ' the\deeds are
signed .and"; recorded -$125,000 of out
side capital, will have. been invested in
Oakland. ' The ; transaction Involves the
sale 1 of I one - of, the largest centrally lo
cated: business r blocks inUhe* city and
the purchaser I la r buying the _ property
strictly as an" Investment proposition.
William J.Laymance. the president or
! the company, through which the deal
i has' been -made.; said to-day:
"I can only say at this time that the
sale of this -block ia a certainty and
that the purchaser is a newcomer to
this city.*. Owing to the fact that this
is an investment of outside capital I
consider it one of the j most Important
sales of the present year. Negotia
tions are practically, -completed. ,but
both the purchaser and the seller , or
the property have; , requested that
neither their names nor the location or
the property be made public until the
time comes for filing- the transfer. _.
The lantern -slides; prepared from
views of Oakland' and points of. inter
est In Alameda County and sent ; East
by the Oakland Board of Trade for ex
hibition in the theaters of the leading
cities, have proved one of -the best.ad
vertisements of the beauties of -the
State ever sent from California. Sec
retary Edwin Steams of the board has
been re'celvlng very good reports as. to
their, effectiveness. ;--"" \u25a0*-â¢'
Frank J. ; Woodward of thf. .Realty,
Bonds and Finance Company says that
in the last week thirteen lots in the
; Woodlawn rPark property have been
Isold, many. of them to newcomers to
Alameda County. This makes* a total
of fifty-three ; lots hi- this tract ,-sotd
since the property was - placed on the
market* two weeks ago. -â¢;- '-.--;
Taylor Brothers & Co. report a steady
demand v for ' all ' kinds of residence
property, a large percentage of the In
quiries received by 'them coming from
"people residing in other parts of the
State t and In the East. .; They are now
handling some choice " suburban prop
erty and report several' fairly large
sales , during the week just ended.

OAKLAND, June 25. â When- the bal
loon which was to have been used to
raise Professor- John. J. Montgomery's
aeroplane at Emeryville thisat'temoon
was rent -in to . tatters . by the, . heavy
wind, f. Larsen'.one of the professor's
assistants, reeled from the mass of torn
canvas and tangled cordage: Ktagger
' ing across the race track, from which
the ascension was to have been made,
he fell insensible in'a ditch at the side
lof the ! course.' v'Larsen I had .-been j sta
tioned inside \u25a0 the balloon while it;; was
being inflated and was overcome by the
fumes of the flaming gasoline. Had it
not been for the destruction. of the ;bigr
gas bag by the wind it is probable; he
would have" met death in; his canvas
prison, for when 1 the; rending of the
sides" of the -balloon; allowed him to
escape into thVopen air he was at the
point of death from suffocation and was
unable to speak. \u25a0 ' ; \u25a0:â¢;
Drs. O. D. Haml inland H. P. Travels,
who were. among the spectators, were
called to the aid vOf- the strangling
workman/who was-. removed to ."the
emergency hospital of the race track.
After several hours of hard work they
pronounce^^ntm out of danger and he
\u25a0vyas taken to his- home in San Fran
cisco. ;.: '\u25a0''\u25a0'.' ' '\u25a0'\u25a0':\u25a0'\u25a0\u25a0 - ,- '\u25a0\u25a0.\u25a0'.
That the proposed exhibition of the
areoplane was not'a success- to-day was
in no way the fault of the : machine or
of its inventor. Throughout the after
noon .a heavy wind,, almost a", gale,
swept over the race track,' and .a num
ber of old-time aeronauts" who";. were
oh the ground advised the professor not
to attempt -the ascension. :Uhwilling
to disappoint the large crowd- which
had gathered to witness the exhibition.
Professor : Montgomery 'waited for more
than an hour, and then, as the force of
the wind seemed to have lessened some
what, he gave : the order; to s ljave . the
balloon, inflated .for, the ascension. -. â¢
.As soon,; as the swelling; canvas b'e^
gan to present anVextended surface to
.the force of the' wind there was troubled
The great- bag began to sway, and: re
peatedly tore itself free from those who
held it, until the grip of many hands
on the canvas ripped the fabric, allow
ing the wind to get inside.': A moment
later the.- big balloon hung in- s"hreds
from the guy ropes. In order that those
who paid the admission to .the 'grounds
to-day may have an opportunity to see
the aeroplane in action,. a free exhibi
tion will be given on a date to be set
later. -'"'..., ';, \u25a0 * Â£ '_\u0084â¢.'â¢ *'\.

This led to the announcement that John
L. is to fight Charlie Mitchell in Sep
tember in Seattle. The proposed match
has been called the "graveyard cham
pionship" fight, j
It has been suggested ; that the go be
held out near Lone . Mountain : for the
benefit of the sporting fraternity that
has gone before. Nobody, has suggested
it to John L., though.

"John L. Sullivan is at the Palace Ho

keep the crowd in order! 1 ? â¢ Judging;f rom
the effect it caused last night the glamour
of the name <is fadine a trifle. John? L.V
is almost the- same John :L.: L. our. * fathers
worshiped, plus j embonpointâ it is forbid-^

presenceâ and/ a plentiful : sprinkling of
gray in- his hair. '.-;
When the interviewer tapped timidly
upon the door a voice that sounded like
a fog '- horn with influenza : bellowed
"Come in." ,-; It * was the sort ; of invita
tion that one might expect to receive
from Monarch, the grizzly bear.' -
John L. was seated at a : table puffing
a big black cigar. Without - rising he
reached out his hand. It was a leathery,
affair. and not quite as. big as a doormat,
but once upon a time, thousands* stood
in line to shake that hand.' So two fingers
of it were clasped in fitting 'reverence.' ;
, John L. did norspar for wind. \u25a0 He be
gan to be "interviewed as soon as the
gong sounded."- It was a monologue. \u25a0.-*
"Hâ , I ain't' old," he said. "I'm Just as
good as I was twenty years ago. Course,
I can't do' a hundred in* ten seconds like
I used, to, but I can give some of ; them
a run yet and I be running; after them.'
They won't be chasing me. Why, now
they call a man 27 an . old man. Why, I
fought, my best fight at that age.v .
Throe sailors of the ship are held by
th^ quarantine officers, as they are sup
posed to be Fuffering from trachoma.
The Germanicus left Singapore Febru
ary 28 under command of Captain Behr
rnann and arrived at Samarang on March
13. he called away from that port the
same day for Mojf, where she arrived
on April 4. ShÂ«* sailed the same day for
Kobe, which place she reached April 10.
Here she took on a general cargo of
Japanese goods, including bamboo work,
tapioca and rice. On April 14 as she was
preparing to sail the <argo in hatches 1,
2 and 3 vas found lo 'be on lire. The
. vessel was lying in the harbor at the time
and was immediately beached. Meantime
the flames burst out with great fury from
hatch No. l. Tons of water were poured
Into the burning portion of the ship, and
after a fight of four days the flames were
subdued. The vtssel was towed out into
"the stream, where about 400 tons of her
burned cargo -was thrown overboard, and
20C0 tons of new cargo taken on board.
The ship was repaired at Kobe at a cost
of about $12,000. On June 1 she salkd
for Mojl. arriving there on June 3. After
taking on coal she sailed for this port on
June 5. The loss to the cargo by burning
was about $150,000. Captain Berndt took
command of the vessel at Kobe, relieving
Captain Behrmann, who returned to
Hamburg. Captain Berndt reports that
at 7:30 yesterday morning, when between
Kort Point and Lime Point he saw a
whale about 150 feet long. It was spiash
lns and spouting, and was only about 200
yards distant from the steamer. This is
the second trip of the Germanicus to this
port, her last visit here being made In
Xovf xnber, 1004. The Germanicus is a
sister ship of the Severus and the Romu
lus, which were captured by the Japanese
as they were attempting to run into
Vladievostok with provisions for the Rus
sians.
The Germanieus as a blockade runner
\u25a0was more successful, as Bhe succeeded in
getting into Vladivostok last July with
a cargo of 6000 tons of coal, which she
had taken from Newcastle. England. As
th? Germanicus was approaching Vladi
vostok at that time she was chased by
Vko Japanese torpedo boats, but in the
night she entirely extinguished her lights,
an<l "managed to pet away and reach port
In safety. The Germanicus is consigned
to Maldonado & Co. She brings a cargo
of general merchandise, including copra,
kapok, bamboo goods and rice. She was
117 days from Singapore and 20 days from
Mo.q.
The German *Uamer Germanicus â¢ ar
rived in port yesterday. She showed lit
tle appearance of the fires that had raged
In her hold at Kobe, and that for a
time threatened to burn up the valuable
cargo she carried, as well as doom the
stanch boat to destruction.

the outlay. 'If. -would open -up a fertU*

Woman's equality in all privileges as
contemplated by "â¢; Christianity was the
opinion voiced last : nlghtby,the Rev. Dr.
Francis Larkin \u25a0 In; his sermon at Grace
Methodist Episcopal Church, where a
large congregation? was assembled. The
sermon was the concluding one of a se
ries on woman, and in it Dr. Larkin held
that the elevation of .women was synony
mous with the progress ,of Christianity.
Among other ' things," the doctor said:
S "Christianity contemplated nothing less
than the equality 'of '.women in "all privi
leges. Voting is simply, the expression of
opinion and choice, and I consider thl3
woman's right and' society's need. My
theme to-night is The Woman With the
Painted Face.' Second Kings, chapter
9-30: 'And Jezebel painted her face and
tired her head, and sat at the_window.*
"We recognize the, fact that" where one
woman has led a man to ruin there, ha vo
been ten .women led. to ruin by men.. Of.
lesser crimes 40,000 are committed by men
to 30,000 \by women, | and jj women commit
but 8 per. cent of the grosser^crimes.--;. .-..'
"The^ influence of marriage and the fam
ily upon the state is one which is of para
mount;, importance.. .Marriage for con
venience^ and money. ;without love Is an
infraction" of the Seventh Commandment.
The marriage : of * Jezebel and Ahab was
one of ' convenience and money and the
end of it was a.trinity of tragedies. JeZe
bel preferred crime to inconvenience. Her
history â¢ was repeated in the lives, of An
tony and, Cleopatra,* in the lives of Bou
langerand of -Parnell, men who disgraced
their names through bad women. Any
woman without piety in her heart Is unfit
to be the companion of any man." j
Dr. j Larkln then spoke of women with
rich fathers looking to marry titles on the
other side of the Atlantic and of fortune
seekers who look to marry -American heir
esses. These he placed _in the class of
"marriage for convenience.* and he lik
ened them to Jezebel, the "woman with
the painted face." and Ahab. HÂ» consid
ered such a condition most reprehensible.
To Protect Property From Flre.
,The Fire Department has issued in
structions to residents of this city to
take every precaution to protect prop
erty from flre during the Fourth of
July. Fire apparatus should be ready
for use, especially spalls of-, water
should be. in reach for extinguishing a
flre in its early" origin. Gratings in
the sidewalks should be covered so as
to prevent burning fireworks from fall
ing into basements. ' Sidewalks and
planked' areas should be kept wet dur-^
ing the day. Rubbish and other In T
flammable material should be placed
where it cannot come In contact with
fire. ;.' : :
According to a. staterrient given but by
Police /Detective Armstrong \u25a0< cQncerning
the \u25a0.detention/ in.- the 'City Prison for four
days of Mrs. {Alice Green, -that lady has
an "excellent suit for false imprisonment
against . the .-officers' 1 responsible 'for her
arrest, and Miss Nellie Sullivan of 1713
Golden Gate avenue," who made the ac
cusations that -led to Mrs. Greenes incar
ceration *is -in \u25a0 a very ; ; humiliating . posi
tion; if" not herself liable to Mrs. Green 1
for 'damages. Armstrong admits that
Mrs. : Green was allowed to go her way
because Tthere was no evidence on which
to convict her: of the crime of petty lar
ceny, andalso^that he and Miss Sullivan
are 7 now ;convinced, that Mrs. Green did
not | purloin Uwo . diamond { rings of the
value /of s $150 ; that she % was accused of
making ;way with. / Though Armstrong
talks 'of petty, larceny,, it Is a fact that
the. stealing of Anything above the .value
of $50 is ! grand \ larceny. : \u25a0 : . - ' â¢ ,
, The" police have succeeded ' at least in
acting as a collecting agency in the mat
ter. There lies in the oflJce of the prop
erty clerk a bundle . of feminine apparel
that "was once the property of Miss Sulli
van and which . she can \ have by - calling
for it. -The articles in the bundle were
found \ by** Detectives 'Harper and Arm
strong under; search "Warrant process in
the room . formerly occupied , by ,{ Mrs.
Green,- at the residence of Mrs. Catherine
Marino, 109 ColUngwood street, In this
city./- Armstrong admits uiat "most" of
these" articles were. given to Mrs. Green
by Miss Sullivan. Mrs. Green says that
Miss Sullivan is { welcome to them again.
Captain . of : Detective? Burnett is -.very
anxious to shift jail responsibility in the
matter. ' He says he knows nothing of the
case* but that it has'been "entirely in the
hands ; of Armstrong and iiarper.
The 'search \u25a0 warrant was obtained by
Miss Sullivan on June IS. She made affi
davit: that* on May 17 certain clothing and
jewelry ; were stolen from her home and
that she believed Mary Marino of 109 Col
lingwood i street knew where it was con
cealed. The " house was searched, fthe
clothing i seized, and â¢ on . the evening /of
June ;18 Armstrong incarcerated the
young : woman ' w.io was booked "as Mrs.
Alice Green, j She sent for Father Stark
of the Paullst-Churcn, who declares "he
was only . called" in jas her spiritual \ ad
viser and that he kno^vs nothing of the
details of; the alleged thefts.
The detectives say , that Mrs. Green was
visiting at the house ' of Miss Sullivan
when .the diamonds disappeared and that
the : two women had been warm friends.
At the Collingwood-street house' it was
declared that Mrs. Grcin had' been only
a roomer there.

The round yoke in this design is cleverly trimmed with insertions of needls
point that are worked directly upon the sheer linen fabric, although applica
tions of almost any lace would fill the bill as well. The yoke is cut all in
one piece, the shoulder seam being eliminated 'altogether, and, the fasten
ingâarranged in the back. The blouse is shirred, over cords to the yoke.
and the . lace appliques are worked in' slightly wavy lines all around the
body. Those on the full puff sleeve match; and the deep fitted cuff comes
halfway to the elbow. For a slender figure this design offers a clever adjust
ment of the fullness that cannot fail to prove becoming.

;who related how he found Admiral | Maka

T~^ NGLAND'S determination to loyally support France in what
r^ soever decision the latter country may. make in regard to
\u25a0*f*' Germany's demand for changes in French control of Moroc
can affairs suggests an estimate of what Germany could do about
invading England in case France determined to be unyielding and
Germany was stubborn in insisting on what she deems her rights.
The question of the possibility of invading England was not long
ago brought up in : the British Parliament and Premier. Balfour
made it very plain that in the opinion of the Government .the feat
â of landing on the English coast an army large enough to capture
could not be accomplished. â¢ ,Jr â¢]';
Jj&jfaL n& e other hand, not many, months ago, a German military
Arfcxpcrt wrote a paper which was published in one of the leading re
i\'jjVicws, in which he expressed an opinion that a^Cerman army could
* invade Great Britain. In the old days, when Germany's
- - ,SMrift)and easy conquest of France was fresh in men's minds, there
â¢7was;a story credited :by Old European soldiers that Yon Moltkc
had some wonderful secret plan all made out.by which a.. German
arrny;could cross the channel with what England would deem in
credible swiftness. It is to be noted jthat the latest German mili
tary expert also counted on the celerity of the movements of the
. Kaiser's troops being something far and away, ahead of the expedi-
Ption of any soldiers in the world. â¢ " C: ,^ :
The British Premier in expressing his conviction of his.coun
try's immunity from invasion made his calculation on at least forty
eight hours being/required by any assaulting army- to land. ..If the
possibility of. attack can be figured downUo be mainly a. question of
hours, and .from the tone of the discussion by>the authorities it is
evident that time would be a most important factor in the result, it
* would be" interesting to know what Yon Moltke's or other .'.German'
estimate of- the time required is. Whatever; be' the difference, it is
very likely to be the truth that English authority is merely'; guess
ing at -the -time it would take an army to land, while the "German
experts know almost to the fraction of an hour how long it would
take them to cross and disembark.

A' STORY FOR THE CRI'MCS.
There is a little story ~ of the Sultan
of Turkey, and It has. a little moral
pinned to it, which we commend to the
critics. \u25a0 - ; > : â¢ .. -.
Once upon a time the Sultan wrote
a poem. . "Read . it," he said, to his
hired literary critic, Â»"and say what you
think of it."
"Magnificent!" exclaimed the critic.
"Glorious as the sun! Matchless as the
moon!" . \u25a0â¢:.-,
"You're a liar," said thg^Sultan. "It's
the worst thing* I ever â¢ did. Ho,
there!"â calling to the guardâ "Oft with
this fellow's head!" â¢
Now, only- ; the other day, ; a certain
man who had in his employ a fellow
of literary tendencies^ submitted to him
ah article, with :these"instructlons:
. "I wrote this thing myself, and I
think, highly, of it; nevertheless, be
candid with me, j and,, if . you think it's
worth nothing, â¢ say so. I .want the
truth."
Thus urged, the critic rendered this
decision: "It is very weakâ ill -written,
and would not'be; considered ; by any
person' of literary taste .and judgment."
VWhereupon the author and employer.
In great rage, kicked the candid critic
out of the front door, and he lost his
job and his dignity and is now trying

â¢-NPTIM ISM continues the keynote of business all 'over the
f ) country. Nothing is apparently able" to dislodge it from the
Iverag-e commercial mind. Crop damage reports, political
specters on the domestic and foreign horizons, and the cautionary
croakings of the wise old ravens of trade and finance are alike im
potent to pertMrb the prevailing confidence in the future. ' -
Current xonditions certainly justify, this general confidence.i The,
crop prospects on which the country largely depends for its pros
perity continue bright' and while the wheat yield may not prove the
bumper anticipated some weeks ago, it will be sufficient for all our
needs, with a balance left for export, and the corn and cotton crops,
from present indications, will produce large harvests. Money con
tinues plentiful and cheap everywhere, the failures are few and un
important, the' bank clearings are still running. high, the railroad
earnings lead those of the corresponding period last year, the dis
tributive trade all over the country is active, and a vast amount of
money is to be disbursed for dividends and bond interest on the ist
of July. These are facts, and it is on these that the prevailing op
timism is based. Is
Iris evident that the expansion in trade is leading the natural
increase accompanying the growth of population. There have been
indications of late" that production has been creeping up on con
1 sumption in some lines, but .the point of unition has not yet been
reached. . Until it is, trade of course will continue to expand. When
the output overtakes the absorption, then the expansion ceases, and
when it passes it there will be a lull.
The country has been expecting that lull for several years, but
barring the first half of last year, when there were visible signs of re
, action, it has not yet arrived. This is shown by the remarkable exhibit
of the bank clearings, which last week mounted to "$3,309,000,000,
or 27.6 per cent over last year, with 77 out of the 90 cities and towns
reporting' clearings showing a gain, most of them large, such as
34.5 per cent, at New York, 23 at Chicago, 23.9 at Philadelphia, 28.8
at san-Francisco,n -Francisco, 16:8 at Pittsburgh 33.9 at New Orleans, 16.8 at Bos
ton, and so on down the long list. This exhibit is simply brilliant,
and as long as it continues, week after week, with unvarying prog
ress, it will D*e impossible to dislodge the spirit of optimism per
vading the atmosphere of trade. : ""N^
Affirmative of this is the indifference with which several ordinar
ily disquieting conditions have recently been regarded. Not many
years ago the 'Russian-Japanese war would have violently agitated
numerous. branches of agricultural and manufacturing industry, the
squabble in the Equitable Assurance Society would have dislocated
half the joints of Wall- street, and the Moroccan incident would have
drawn the strings, of the. European purse tighter than ordinary finan
cial fingers could have loosed them. They have produced no effect
of importance. There is so much available money in all. quarters
of the civilized globe, and it is so readily available for all safe un
dertakings, that every posted merchant and financier feels that even
if the money market be suddenly confronted by a huge draft it can
be met. This, feeling â the feeling of safety which always accom
panies the possession of a large balance at -bankâ is universal, be
gets and maintains confidence, and is a potent preventive of all pan
ick}' apprehensions.
These general conditions being so sound and assuring, details
are superfluous. Unfavorable weather may reduce the yield of
wheat, corn and cotton here and there, but the country is vast and
its normal crops so large that an abundance is~ almost sure to be
produced. .Every few weeks. the iron and steel- industry shows signs
of lagging, but it -proves only transitory and the activity is speedily
renewed. Meanwhile all parts of the country report remarkable
animation in real estate and building operations, labor fully em
ployed at the highest rates of wages ever known, the great majority
of mills and factories running on full and some on over time, with
plenty of orders booked ahead, and the farmers so reinforced finan
cially by years of prosperity that as a class they are indifferent
whether they sell their .product this month or next, or until next
year, for that matter. We are a conservative and careful nation as
a rule, and while we sometimes run into extravagance and have
done so recently, we never actually lose our heads, and have always
that possible reaction in the corner of our eye. .
That reaction will surely come, for prosperity cannot last un
interruptedly forever, but when? While no man knows, it is safe to
say that there are no signs of its appearance yet, and that the pros
pects for another prosperous year are excellent. Still, it is a good
thing to remember that the unexpected often occurs and with rude

It was the old hackneyed tale of a
faithful wife and a brutal husband.
The woman's refusal to prosecute was
but a repetition of the old story, "Beat
a woman and she will love you." This
may or may not be true, nevertheless
Mrs. Purdie, whose body was black and
blue, said that Purdie was the father
of her children and she could not send
him to. jail. She would "give him an
other chance."
Purdie is a steward on the steamer
Ruth. He admits having 1 " served time
In the Santa Rosa and Oakland jails
for wife-beating. He alleges that he at
one -time sang In the Tlvoll Theater.
He was intoxicated and the doctors
question Mrs. Purdie's sanity. %
Mrs. John Purdie, a sickly woman,
was sent to the Central Emergency,
Hospital last night by her husband, who
desired her sent to the City and County
Hospital. When put to "bed she told a
harrowing tale of abuse and. neglect
by her husband. She averred, that he
had beaten her on various occasions

WASHINGTON, June 25.â The prices of
fuel, clothing and practically :'â¢ all food
products are constantly . Increasing, ac
cording to a bulletin" just issued by the
Bureau \of Labor, : covering the period
-from 1890 to 1904. In the early . nineties
prices were very , high, but in the last
four years they have been- Eteadlly in
creasing, until now they ; are relatively
higher than in 1892, just before* the finan
cial and commercial depression. .
The; period of lowest prices .was -from
IS9J to 1897. "The lowest price of beef was*
In April, 1896, when the best choice meat
was quoted at $3 85 to $4 25; a hundred.
The highest price was in the latter part

The subjoined talk of Dr. David Starr
Jordan's, in which he voices the same
sentiments as those expresst-d by Presi
c>nt Roosevelt in BuSalo in 1901, are
hrirgin* good cheer to the hearts of the
workers for "Equal v Rights" â with
"E<jual Duties" â¬t caursY
Dr. Jordan expressed himself- as fol-
Jows at the Santa Clara County Equal
Suffrage Association at Palo Alto:
"Personally 1 am in favor of suffrage
for women or of anything that adds
freedom knd does not interfere with any
or.c else's rights. Effort brings capacity
snd growth. On the whole, woman's
work ts as well or better done than man's.
MÂ«ii and women are much the 6ame kind
of creatures and their interests are the
same. The greater the responsibility the
better the work done, is a good general
rule. A new viewpoint is not always a
better one, but it. brings a broadening,
and Is therefore/a real gain. Suffrage
would bring broader interests to women,
interest in realitiesâ and that Is a thing
tv be desired.
"There are several classes of men that
o|>i>ose woman suffrage. It will be found
usually that the saloon element is un
friendly, as they fear that public opinion
might then interfere with the profits. The
Ealoon Is a bad thing, because It leads
to destruction of men, and public opinion,
when expressed. Is merely what women
think about what men ought to do.
"Brutal men, who value only what can
be done with their fists or their money,
and finaclal men, who themselves carÂ©
rot for national affairs, both think
woman's demand unnecessary.
''A few practical men fear it would
Â»dd confusion to the politics because of
the absentee vote. The answer to that
argument is to' deprive a voter of the
suffrage who falls to usÂ© it. : Objections*
on the theoretical grounds of a division
of labor have all been met, for while
men are often relatively stronger in out
ride matters, woman Is stronger in near
things. Government is concerned with
both large and small affairs, and the
creat questions of statesmanship have
but raall part in polltlcar work.
"Women -will gain added wisdom
As to the topics to be discussed, the
suffrage question in its political aspect
will not wholly fill the programmeâ the
social and civic elements of it finding
mary exponents, including speakers on
child-labor laws, divorce and divorce
laws, property-rights of women, finan
cial obligations of married women, guar
dianship of children, etc.
So it might be wife for the menâ such
as are directly interestedâ to come and
s*e what happens up there.
But meanwhile, "Don't worn"."
And from San Francisco has a goodly
delegation gone, among them Dr. Doro
thea Moore, Mrs. Austin Sperry, Mrs.
Lloyd Baldwin. Mrs. William Ruth
(Berkley), Miss Schlingeheyde and Miss
Mary Falrbrother, all of whom can be de
pended upon to give a good account of
themselves when the convention gets
busy.
- And that the National "Equal Rights
Convention should meet in Portland, at
an exposition commemorative of thÂ«
Lewis and Clark expedition, is eminently
mÂ«et and just. For know ye ail, that
were it not for a womanâ Sacajawea, the
"Bird Woman I 'â Lewis and Clark would
never have carried their packet to the
ocpan: for were it not for her. this brave
little Indian woman, they.' would have
pt-rished from want In the wilds of the
mountains where they had lost their
way; or been put to death by the Indians
whose hunting-ground they had violated;
and thus would the commission, so nobly
carried to completion in the name of the
Governmentâ and now so worthily com
memoratedâbeen an unhappy failure, but
tor a. woman, brave Sacajawea.
But Sacajawea, with her papoose strap
ped to her back, was thÂ« guide that led
them to the great blue ocean, and thÂ© In
disputable medium that gave th* Gov
ernment the first authentic knowledge of
the great Northwest- v
Therefor* Is it eminently fit that where
co primal a part In a Government drama
was played by a woman, that women of
a later day should meet to take issue
with that Government for its unjust dis
crimination against womenâ and for no
more logical reason than that, by an
Incident of birth, they were feminine,
though otherwise equipped, equal to men,
and very, very much like them in hopes,
ambitions, loves, desires, appetite, fail
ures and capabilities, with mental, moral
and spiritual flistlnctlons so slightly
marked as to be but differentiations.
Therefore Is It that Susan B. Anthony,
the plucky old lady who told the world
those things when our mothers wore ;
pigtails, has Journeyed across the con
tinent to address the convention of Wom
en Who Aren't Afraid To Declare Them- !
selvesâ now that she has blaxed the way.
And therefore is it that , Anna B.Shaw, i
Charlotte Perkins Gllmari, Mrs. Catt and
Other notable political pioneers. Journey- '
ed pver Saca^awea's trail to attend that :
famous convention. i
Portland will be in ' the hands of the
Equal Rights folkâ who, by the way are
far from being all womenâ from June 30
to July 5.
If so, let him apply to thÂ© Oqtdoor Art
League , Department pf the California
Club. i \u25a0
But when grass grows on the square
where once the Mission orchard flourished
âand trees sway softly to the breezes that
blow from hills beyond, the place will loon
less geared, less brutalized.
And,' by the way, could not some of
those old Rufflno" trees be secured for the
plat near Sixteenth street? One would
rather save the prickly pearâ it is so
splendid ana so characteristic of the
Spaniard in all his abodes, but is there any
San Franciscan with a hide tough enough
to move it?
It is to be hoped that the planting be
proceeded with without delay.
It has long been a sorrow to those who
love the old mission and the hallowed
scenes about it to see bit after bit of^the
old civilization, with its grapevines, its
pear trees and its prickly pear plucked up
and thrown in the ash heap. And now the
last bitâ the garden of the Ruffinosâ soon
must go, with Its vines and its prickly
pear and Its fruit trees. -,
Almost three years have elapsed since
the Outdoor Art League Department of
the California Club propagated the idea of
making more attractive the approach and
surroundings of the old Mission Dolores,
the oldest historic landmark of San Fran
cisco, and soon to be open to the public.
Plans were prepared by Bruc* Porter, and
through the public spirit of the Board of
Supervisors, who appropriated $5000 in the
municipal budget, and the Board of Pub
lic Works, under whose auspices the work
was performed, the improvement is be
coming a reality. Small central parks
have been laid out, two in the middle of
Dolores street near Fifteenth and two
near Seventeenth street, with grass plats
along the outer edge of the sidewalks, on
both sides of both blocks. Stone curbing
and the necessary watering facilities have
been provided. Ko planting haa yet been
done, but as the idea originated with the
Outdoor Art League Department the
members will not cease their efforts until
the entire work adornment Is complete.
The ladles of the department express
themselves as . much gratified with the
action of the Board of Supervisors and
the Board of Public Works and with their
active co-operation in developing the sug
gestion of the league.

through effort, and the suffrage is merely
a matter of time and endeavor, for the
arguments once advanced against it are
not tenable to-day."

YOUNTVLL"LE. June 25.â The excessive
use'by members of the Veterans' Home of
Intoxicating .liquors of the vile quality
served- up to them iji the saloons of
Yountvllle" since the home canteen was
abolished' a year agois becoming a seri
ous matter : in its results. > Another mem
ber of the Veterans' Home at Yountville
ha 3 been found .in a dying condition on
the road leading into the home.
J. P.- Marsan,_who has been a member
of the' home" for about four years, had
been missing from his quarters since yes
terday. To-dav_at 1 o'clock hi was found
unconscious on the road and , brought to
the hospital: at the home in a state of
complete collapse. : It is supposed he had
been visiting one or more of the many
grog shops in Yountville, as he is suffer
ing from alcoholism aggravated by ex
treme exposure. His death Is probable.
Dr. W. F." McAllister, medical director
of the home, stated to-day that the liquor
sold in most of the saloons In Yountville
is of a .very inferior quality. He said:
"There . are several decent saloons In
Yountville." but , ' the majority of - these
men -. do ' not - patronize these saloons and>
judging -from the effects ; of the liquors
sold . in : the ofces " : they do patronize, it
must be of a vile sort. It seems to act
as alcoholic \ poison, and has caused a
greatnumber of deaths among the mem
bers of the home. Not long ago an em
ploye of the Magnolia saloon deposited a
veteran in a' dying condition on the base
ment floor of the hospital and he died
within fifteen minutes after his admission.
When the canteen was In existence. the
men here were furnished with double
stamped goods eight years old. purchased
in bund, | and all other liquors were of
equally good quality."
"There is intense indignation among the
members of the home over an article in
a San Francisco paper to-day wherein
they are .called "pauper inmates." ThÂ«
veterans- residing at tne home are pot
'â¢paupers'! or "inmates." Tne national
and State I laws and the . Grand Army I re
ports designate- them as "members" of
the home. The membership of 1000 in the
California home represents intelligent
men of high character. The home is es
tablished and maintained for them not as
a! measure "of charity, but as a recogni
tion of their \u25a0 services In defense of the
country.- The appellation of "pauper"
applied to the disabled veteran is sharply
resented In camp.

lne Her.
A woman tells how coffee kept her
from Insuring her life:
"I suffered for many years chiefly
from trouble with my heart, with severe
nervous headaches and neuralgia; but al-
though Incapacitated at times for my
house work, I did not realize the gravity
of my condition till I, was rejected for life
Insurance, because, the examining physi-
cian said, my heart was so had he could
not pass me. _This distressed me very
much, as I was a widow and had a child
'dependent upon me. .It was to protect
her future that^ I wanted to Insure my
life.
"Fortunately for me, I happened to
read an advertisement containing a test!-
monial from a man who had been affect-
fd In the same way that I wjys with heart
trouble, and who was cured by leaving
off Coffee and using Postum Food Coffee.
I gratped at the hope this held out, and!
made the change at once. j
"My health began to Improve â¢â¢ immedl- i
ately. The headaches and neuralgia dls- |
aprearfd. I gained In flesh, and my ap- i
petite came back to me at once/Greatest
of all, my heart was . strengthened from |
the beginning, and soon all the distress- !
ing Eymptoms passed away.. No more
waking up In the night with my heart
trying to fly out of my mouth! Then I
again made application for'life insurance,
and had no trouble in passing the med-
ical examination. â¢
"II was seven years ago that I began
to use' Postum Food Coffee, and I am
using It still, and shall continue to do
fo. as 1. find in it- a guarantee of good
health.'.' Name given by Postum "Com-

The fans invaded Recreation Park
yesterday afternoon filled -with a desire
to root.. They had' their wishes grati
fied as baseball wishes were never
gratified on Sunday, afternoon before,
for the Seals and the Angels mixed it
for sixteen agonizing spasms. The root-
Ing of the home fans seemed to tell,
for with two gone in the sixteenth,
Danny Shea tore over the plate after
an error by Brashear, putting an end
to a game that will live in baseball his
tory. Score â San Francisco 6, Los An
geles 5. '
It was not such a mighty ball game
until nine rounds had been reeled off.
Then it became great. As inning after
inning rolled by the strain became In
tense. Men reached the bases and were
on the point of coming home and
breaking up the game, when some won
derful throw or other stunt equally
marvelotis was pulled off as the fans
prepared to go. They were forced to
sit down again and watch with eager
interest the ending of the fight.
Tozior. fresh from the bushes, stepped
on the rubber here for the first time
wearing a Los Angeles suit and before
the game was over he was the most
popular man in the lot. Every time
the fans secured a glimpse of the trim
form of the Salt Laker they cheered
and yelled and called for a speech. He
did riot make any talks, but he pitched
baseball and came near winning his
game with a double in the thirteenth.
Toz.kr had nothing but a bunch of
confldenee and his mitt. He was mak
ing good every inning and that was all
thÂ« fanatics cared. He was giving them
the goods and fooling the Seals. They
did not want to see the home team
beatrn, nor did they want to see Tozier
suffer humiliation, so they got busy
Â»n<f cheered for the Seals and then for
Tozler and the cheer* were deserving In
both instances.
The new pitcher could not keep the
jinks away in the sixteenth inning,
though he managed to pitch himself
safely out of many a hole. Cousin
Parkft Wilson opened the round with
a driv* to center. Shea forced him on
a poor bunt. Tozier's jinks first ap
peared when Jimmy Whalen popped out
a high fly to center which no one took
the trouble to get under, leaving two
on the sacks and a dead one.
"Spencer came up full of confidence,
but produced only a weak grounder to
Tim Flood. Tim was then confronted
with a funny play. Whalen loitered
bpti\f<rn first and second and Flood
tossed the ball to the initial bag, re
tiring Spencer. It looked like a double,
when Eagar winged to Brashear, but
Brash dropped the throw.* Shea k"ept on
coming and amid the insane yells of
the multitude crossed the pan.
\u25a0 The Ang*.ls finished the game with a
mottled ball team. Cap Dillon was
banished in the tenth for kicking. Ber
nard got his in the" thirteenth for a
like offense. Eagar and Gray took the
places of the deposed stars, and while
thÂ»ir work was good in its line, the
Angel front was weakened to a marked
degree/ '.
-Tlie Seals had the game 4 to 3 in the
ninttc, when Ross' double, a pass to
Crarath and Bernard's wallop put the
Angels onÂ«, to the good. Joe J^ealon
Â° drove' out a double to the score^ board
in the Seals' half of the round/ Wil
son advanced !;Im on an out and Danny
Shea came through with the long fly
that made the deadlock last for seven
innings." ,
Williams was. pitching great ball, but
showed a streak of. wildness in . the
< thirteen* b. and Wilson trotted Whalen
toot oji the "firinig line. Jimmy was
Mngled lively for a while and it seemed
he was going to get his, but a couple
of clever plays stalled off defeat and
gave the Seals a chance to, triumph.
The Seals filled up every â¢cushion In
the thlr.t*fenth. still never a run
came through. The full house came
about on- an error by Flood, a bunt by
JCealon and a pass to Wilson.. \u25a0 Shea
6truck out. Williams flew, to left and
Irwin. ivj^s caught on an attempted. hit
and run play, so they all perished on
j the sacks.
TbÂ« Angels were frozen out by Parke
WilrQJi's great throw in the fifteenth.
Toman had singled and Ross planted a
preat two-cushioner far^ over /Wilson's
bead in the left garden. ' Parke went
" to the fence after the ball, ..relayed It to
Hildebrand. who winged it to Shea Just
In time to catch Toman at "ttie pan: ~ It
was one of the greatest relay plays
Â«Â»ver made on the lot and get the crowd
mad with glee.
Tfce Seals played both games without
Gochnaucr, who injured his ankle on
Saturday. Hildebrand played a clever
gr*rne in the afternoon, but was not
there in the morning and- the Angels
tben broke their longr list of defeats
by landing: the game, 4to 3. Gochnauer
will probably be ready to put his
working; cult on Tuesday. The scores:

RESULTS OF GAMES.
j Although Heno, may follow in the foot-
I steps of Alan-a-Dale and fall: to show any

NEW YORK; June 25.â A smart' field Is
carded to start In the Equality stakes at
Sheepshead to-morrow and all that can
be desired is a fast track. Every, race
on the card* is attractive and from, first to
last features abound. Heno^ is to /reap
pear, and. the Buffalo derby winner is to
have another try with Dolly Spanker, but
on much worse . terms than .when he
worsted him before. The St. .Louis derby
winner. Uncle Charley, -is in a spot where
he should be heard from.
Among jj the two-year-old fillies which
are known In the opening event. there does
not seem to be a great amount of class,
so speed should be invaluable. Lillie. B
showed a lot,of form at BelmontPark
and as she has had a good rest since then
she should be at her best.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Considering the strong wind that pre
vailed on the shooting range at Shell
Mound Park. yesterday, the scores were
far above the average. Judge George
H. Bahrs did great work at the compe- -
tition shoot of the San ' Francisco
Schuetzen Vereln, making 74 ring 3 out of
a possible 75 on the 25-rlng target at a
distance of 200 yards. This is the best
single score this year and sets a good
pace for his comrades wita the rifle. In
the. same competition Otto Bremer and
David Salfleld made 73 rings each. August
Jungblut was close on their heels with 72.
In the bullseye contest of the San Fran- â¢
Cisco Sehuetzen Verein the well-known
champion, William Garmes. made the
best bullseye recorded this year. -So close
was his shot to the center that it took
the centimeter machine to demonstrate
is exact position, which was found- to be
.094 of an inch from a true center.* "
The members of. the Veteran -Associa
tion of the Xational Guard did some ex
cellent shooting under adverse conditions.
Sergeant F. T.'Engle and Colonel - L S.
Kellogg . made 45 points each out of 50
with the Springfield rifle under military
rules. The veterans intend to add a
ladies' auxiliary to the club, so ,thelr
wives and sweethearts may participate in
the pleasures of rifle practice. 1 The scores:
