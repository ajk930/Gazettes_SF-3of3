PRISONERS'
CONSPIRACY
IS CRUSHED
Jailbreak Plot at
Martinez Discov
ered in Time.
John Zimmerman, Des
perate Stege Robber,
the Ringleader.
Conceals in Mattress Revol
ver Smuggled in by Dis
charged Man.
OAKLAND. Dec. 23.â With a revolver
In the possession of the most desperate
ene among them, prisoners of the Contra
Costa County Jail planned a break for
i freedom, and had not timely information
of the plot come to Sheriff Veale to-day
a bloody tragedy, of which the Sheriff
himself would probably have been a vic
time, might have reddened the prison
annals of the quiet city of Martinez.
Luckily from that mysterious \u25a0'â¢under
ground" source known to the men of evil
ways came a whisper of the conspiracy
brewing in the caldron of crime, anl
â¢prompt action averted an attempt at a
.break.
Though knowing that somewhere in the
prison was the weapon from which a
bullet might speed to his heart, Sherift
eale boldly entered it and took steps to
frustrate the scheme on foot. That hia
murder was contemplated was believed
from the results of the search made.
It was found that the revolver was in
the possession of John Zimmerman the
Bttgc robbt-r. Suspicion that proved to
be well founded pointed to H. D. Ren
ton, a. former, prisoner, as the man who
eniuggled the revolver inlo the 'jail, ami
lie was arrested in Oakland.
The firearm was found hidden in a mat
tress in Zimmerman's cell. It was fully
loaded. It is of the "bulldog" type, car
rying a cartridge.
ZIMMEHMAX I.XDER GUARD.
I As soon as the weapon had been re- |
covered Zimmerman was placed under a
strong guard. Close watch will be main
tained over the prisoner.
Intimations reached Sheriff Veale late
last right that there was something
wrong in the Jail. There was a hint
dropped within reach of the intrepid peace
officer that it would be well for him not
to make his customary rounds of<the jail
this morning until he had prepared him
self against a possible surprise. Just
how much Vrale knew he has not di
vulged. The first suggestion that there
\u25a0was trouble brewing was received by the
Sheriff from Constable Frank Moitoza of
Point Richmond. That officer, through a
secret channel, learned that a weapon of
mome kind had been surreptitiously
\u25a0worked into the jail, but he was not sure
where it had been concealed.
Likewise came from the same under
ground source a "tip" that a jail-break
was impending and that the life of Sheriff
Veale was in danger. Moitoza sent a
hasty message to the Sheriff, telling him
rot to go into the jail this morning until
Moitoza could get to Martinez. As soon
as the Point Richmond officer arrived
he gave the Sheriff the Information he
possessed.
REVOLVER IX MATTRESS.
Determined to check the plot at its
very beginning. Sheriff Veale took extra
precautions, but also took desperate
chances by going into the jail in his de
sire to at once crush the fconsoiracy
By subterfuge Veale made a search of
every cell in the jail. High and low he
hunted, but for the time his search was
futile.
Then the Sheriff removed every bit of
furniture and bedding from the cells.
Among these were the mattresses. Every
one of them was taken Into the jail yard
and one by one they were saturated with
coal oil and burned. Nothing came of
this move until the mattress in the cell
occupied by Zimmerman was reached. In
its ashes the much sought after revolver
â¢was found. Here was the evidence which
confirmed the story of the plot, the de
tails of which have yet to be learned.
Veale took steps to ascertain that no
other weapons were concealed in the Jail
and then began a campaign to run down
the confederate on the outside.
Renton. charged with having given
Zimmerman the pistol, was arrested to
night at Thirteenth street and Broadway
by Captain of Police W. J. Petersen.
Veale and lloitoza had told the police
whom they suspected, and Captain Peter
6en located Renton. who was preparing
to leave the city when he was captured.
ROBBERY AT STEGE.
The prisoner is one of four men arrest
ed December 8 on a charge of stealing
1000 pounds of copper wire from the Bay
Counties power ttation at Point Rich
mond. " His companions were William
Kelleher, Charles Nelson and Leonard
Wallace. These wen were confined in the
jail an Martinez, pending their trials.
They were fined and released several days
ago. Suspicion attached to them and by
process of elimination Renton was se
lected as the guilty man. -He lives at 529
Jones street and is a locomotive fireman-
Zimmerman's part In the robbery at
Etege shows him to, be capable of the
worst crimes. This robbery: occurred on
March 20 last. Zimmerman, who has
â¢â¢done time," and Thomas A- Collins, an
other ex-convict, both masked and one
carrying a rifle and the other a revolver,
\u25a0waylaid John E. Daly and Frank Roche
j end robbed them of $9000 they were con
veying in a buggy from the Central Bank
of Oakland to the Bank of Richmond.
The robbers left $1000 in silver In the ;
buggy. Ihey bound and* gagged their
victims to make their escape. '
Zimmerman was convicted arid given a ;
liiÂ£ sentence. He was awaiting the re
sult of an appeal to the Supreme Court. -

PARDEE TO APPOINT
SUPERINTENDENT.
Upon receiving the Attorney \ General 's opinion. Governor Par
dee will appoint Reginald H. Webster Superintendent of Schools.
Mayor Schmiiz has announced his selection of Alfred Roncovieri
for the position, and a contest is expected. The Attorney .General s
opinion will deal with the question whether the office is a county
or municipal one.
R. H. Webster Will Be Governor's Choice for
Post in State School Service.
MATOK SCHMITZ' APPOINTER.TO THE POSITION OF SUPERINTENDENT OF
PUnLIC SCHOOLS. AND EDUCATOR WHO MAY BE NAMED FOR THE
SAME PLACE BY GOVERNOR PARDEE. ,
Upon the receipt of an overdue opin
ion from the Attorney General, of the
State, Governor Pardee will announce
the appointment of Reginald H. Web
*ter to the important, poist of Superin
tendent of Schools of San FranciÂ»co.
For tblN name position Alfred Ronco
vieri of tbe present local Board of Edu
cation has already been delected by
-Mayor Schmltx. \u25a0 !
This means that war Is nieh.
The opinion of the Attorney General
Is expected to be in line with an opin
ion delivered in a similar case and will
correspond with the already given de
cision of the Supreme Court regarding
the right of the Governor to fill vacan
cies occurring in State offices.
A bitter fight is being waged by the
partisans of Alfred Roncovieri, the
present president of the Board of Edu
cation, whose selection to the position
of Superintendent of Schools was re
cently announced by Mayor Schmitz.
The question upon which decision will
be made .is whether the office of Super
intendent of Schools is a county or mu
nicipal office.
Prominent local attorneys, well .in
formed in school law?, are generally of
the opinion that the State constitution
plainly indicates that the Superinten
dent of Schools is a county officer and
as such is part of a 'state system. In a
decision in a parallel case,. when a gu
bernatorial and mayoralty appointment
was made to a vacancy in the office of
Justice of the Peace, the Supremo Court
decided that the Justice of the Peace is
a township officer, and the gubernato
rial appointment was confirmed.
The post of Superintendents Schools
Is created by the constitution, which
also defines the term of the office. The
Superintendent of Schools is an execu
tive officer In his county of a State sys
tem, namely, the State school system,
which is in no sense a local affair.
Every city has its City Superintendent
of Schools, who is appointed by the
Board of Education and is usually Its
secretary. ..
The charter confers on the Mayor
certain powers of appointment ' to - fill
vacancies, but the charter Is . fashioned
In certain particulars, as has been dem
onstrated by the. decision of the - Su
preme Court, : vrlthout close reference
to. the rights of : municipal government
as distinctive of powers . conferred ~< on
counties ; by the. constitution and by
legislative enactment. San Francisco
Is anomalous, as' the county is' distinct
ly, a part of the Slate school. system,*
and as such' it bas/and must, elect, un
Â«ler the law, a County Superintendent^
A PARALLEL CASE. : -.\u25a0'. '( {
-At a time when a vacancy, occurred
SAN^FRANGISGO, FRIDAY;. DECEMBER -29^ 1905,
in one of the positions of ; Justice -of
the Peace, . Governor Pardee appointed
Isldor Golden, to the place, while Mayor
Schmitz appointed the ' present .Super
visor, James L 1L 1 . 1 Gallagher. -Ac that
time a contest aroso^and. the matter of
construing the law taken to the
Supremo Court. That body sustained
the "appointment of Pardee on the
ground that:, a; Justice of the ' Peace
was; a township and not a municipal
officer. â¢ r â¢ .
The Supreme Court held that the
charter exceeded its authority in giving
to the Mayor- the power" to appoint
county officers, and that as there was
no other.;mcthod provided by law for
the appointment of a. Justice of the
Peace, it was deemed to be a State.of
flce and part of the State judiciary sys
tem. The conclusion was that appoint
ments to fill the vacancies were vested
in the Governor.
Under the State law the County
Board of Supervisors can fill, the .va
cancy, but the Supreme Court has held
that the Supervisors are- not .members
of a county, board, but of : a municipal
board.. Before the adoption of the
charter the Board of Education < was
recognized as a county board,; but since
the charter went^ into ; effect: the board
has become municipal. ; '

Former Xew York Superin
tendent of Insurance Says
He Has Been Slandered
:\OT FEED BY MUTUAL
Denounces Rumor That He
Got $10,000 for Letting
Company Give Own Report
NEW YORK, Dec. rs.â Louis F. Payn
and. J. Ryder Cady, who" was employed
&'â¢. times as counsel by Payn while the
iatter was State Superintendent of In
surance, were witnesses to-day before
the insurance investigating committee
\u25a0and suppHed- practically all of- the In-
terosting- testimony. __
l'ayn, in reply to one of "the first
questions <isk<?d him, eropliaUcally de
nied the report that he had received
540,000 from the Mutual Reserve Life
Insurance Company and had allowed
ih#t company to write its own report
of an investigation which' Payn had
caused to be made ia JfcSJ*. : Payn char-,
aoterized the report as. absolutely false
In every particular and said it grew out
of a light between James - I>. Wells,
former vice president of the Mutual
- Jteserve, and President Burnham of the
pasne company.
" Judge Cady was brought into the
investigation by reason of his having
appeared before Payn in the Interests
of Prussian insurance, companies seek
ing admif-slon to the United States. This
application was denied by P-ayn, but
two years later it was granted.-- Pres
ident McCurdy of the Mutual Life to
surance Company had asked that this
permission be" held up until he could
pee Payn. This request was refused,
liut Payn had Judge Cady call upon He-
Curdy.
Hughes asked if McCurdy had said
the Mutual Life would pay any money
for \u25a0 a contrary decision. Judge Cady
said he did not, but that McCurdy had
offered him a retainer in behalf of the
Mutual Life, which he' refused.
Robert H. Hunter, the deputy super-
Snttjidenl in charge of the New York
office of the insurance department, vvoh
next testified, said he made an in
quiry into the charges against the offi
cers of the Mutual Life Insurance Com
pany in 1&99. He was unable to say
why they were not reported upon.
Hughes read a letter from the Equit
oble Life Assurance Society to Dr. H.
Tt. Powell of Poughkeepsie. N. V., dis
missing him from its service as a med
ical examiner because he "was at war
with the insurance department."
Hunter said that he had secured the
appointment of Dr. Powell with the
Kquitable Society. Hughes brought out
that when Powell was dismissed the
relations between Hunter and him were
strained because of factional political
O%btM in Poughkeepsie in 1903, when
l>r. Powell was desirous of being elec
ted Mayor. Poughkeepsie Is also Hun
ter's home. Hunter said "I went to
the Equitable Life in my personal ca
pacity and asked them if they wanted
a man like Powell to work for them
and he was dismissed."
Asked how the Equitable Life differ
entiated his personal from his official
capacity. Hunter paid he did not know.

Kabbi Declares That Mpdern
Philosophy. Teaches Vice
Under Cloak of Realism
.CHICAGO, Dec. 28.â That much lit
erature of the day is not worthy of at
j tcntion, that modern philosophy is the
creed of brutality, and that the new
School of. "naturalism" is undermining
the. moral foundations of society, were
ieome.of the^ conclusions of Dr. Emil G.
Hirsch in an address, before the Hull
House Woman's Club yesterday. Dr.
Hirsch said:- . :>\u25a0;.. , ;
Man Is much the same as he iraa a thousand
years ago. The samÂ« elemental passions, am
. bUions. and appetites obtain. They are the
1 Â«san>Â« as those; of -the animals. Science nae
i brought us to' realize this, and our peep into
tbo workshop of nature hae had a tendency to
Liutalize humanity;
- Our .knowledge- that man 1Â« only one of the
<Jompany of brutes- has l*d sn.all men to teach
that man In -all things Is merely a brute. ,ln
their" desire to .tmlfy the world they have
jumped a.t the conclusion that man Is no dif
ferent from thÂ« other creatures that tenant
the earth. In thefr 1 passion to show him as a
beaet. philosophers and authors have reveled
In v(ce and depravity, 1 calling- it reallem.
Society Is drifting, without a compass. It is
a period of transition; the old canons are gone
and the new ones' have not yet been found. ;
Tlw latest announcement of modern philosophy
Is that you may <Jo.- what' you want to, but
don't get caught at X.V If you do. commit sui
cide.' In this . philosophy of brutality you have
Ml explanation for -the fact that literature al
xi-aya paints ~life -as a struggle between the
forces of desire and duty;
Never before In the history of the world was
there so great a need for masters â men who
will Interpret life in terms of eanlty and sanc

ST. LOUIS, Dec. 28.â "There Is no dan

Philadelphia, chairman of the Northern
Presbyterian committee, to-day at the
close of the day's proceedings at . the

for all the details to be submitted by the
sub-committees of the two branches. The

- Rev. \V. H. Black of Marshall, Mo.,
chairman of the Cumberland Presbyter
ian general committee, expressed the
same sentiment.
"There is not the slightest doubt that
the union of the two churches will be ac
complished. Everything' will be done to

The members of the two general com

PROSECUTE JOHN R. WALSH
Chicago Financier Did Not Take One.
Dollar Dishonestly, Snyu Secre- ...
tary Shan.
CHICAGO, Dec. 28. â Secretary of the
Treasury Shaw arrived in the city from
Washington to-day and in an interview
practically declared that there would
be no criminal proceedings growing out
of the closing of the Chicago National
Bank and the Home Savings Bank of
this city. He said:
"John R. Walsh did not take one
dollar dishonestly. He did no more
than many others bankers in the United
States are doing all the time.
"The rumor of criminal prosecution,"
the Secretary added, "is nothing but
talk.. There has been no embezzlement
or theft. For every dollar taken out
gilt-edged security was placed within.
The depositors â¢will get; every dollar,
they deposited and when that has been
accomplished the' responsibility of the
Government ceases. That, part- of the
banking law prohibiting the loaning of
more than 10 per cent of the capitaliza
tion, to one man may -have been vio
lated. That is not a criminal violation,'
and all that can be done is to liquidate
the 'bank and pay on* the depositors.
The violation of that. law by one bank
is no more than has been done. by al
most every bank in the country."

in the libel suit' of Colonel Mann
against the" Colliers of Colliers' Week
ly. Edward M. Post, a broker, told how,
Charles Ahle, representing Town' Top-i
ics, had tried to . extort money from]
him. James A/ Burden Jr., a man of
great wealth, toldhow Robert A. Irving:
visited his residence.
"I received a telephone message that
a representative from Colonel Mann of
Town Topics wished to call on me," he
began, "and when, Irving was an
nounced I receive<Thim in my 'den.' He
stated at once that he was sent by
Colonel- Mann and solicited ray. sub
scription to a publication called 'Fads
and Fancies.' The price wat to 'be
$1500, and he suggested that I be one
of the number to subscribe. I said
â¢No.'
"He said, 'It is a good thing,' and I re
plied that I did'not wish to toe in it under
any circumstances. Then he said that
Town. Topics had treated my family very
well' in the past, and suggested that - 1
subscribe for the book witnout my name
being- in it. : I said 'No.' I saw no reason
to give $ir>oo for the book. He then said
he had spent considerable time, and asked
if I wpuld give him/Tiis commission on
the book/some $300 or $400, I believe. 'You
know Christmas is. coming,' he said.
"He then said, 'Town Topics has
.treated your family well in the past.
You - know that the editor of Town
Topics wjelds a. trenchant pen, and If
I go back to Colonel Mann without a
subscription he will be displeased.' He
then said he might not treat me and my
family as well in the future. I looked
at tWsas a threat and brought the in
terview to a close at onoe."
Burden was then cross-examined by
Mr. Scheurman of counsel for the
prosecution.,
"Now, didn't he say that 'Christmas
was coming 1 in a spirit of banter and
good nature?" inquired Scheurman. .
"No, he did not. I thought that he
wanted the money. He became urgent
and assumed a bulldozing attitude."

has gone to meet Morales. \u25a0
Rodriguez's forces are said to be nu
merous. It Is; claimed here that the re
port that Morales , intends to establish a
new capital at Monte Christi is correct
and that he will use that place as a base
from which he will endeavor to suppress
the uprising of the Caceres party at the
old capital of Santo Domingo. , A censor
ship of all messages has been established
at Monte Christi. Important news from
Santo Domingo is expected' momentarily.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 28.â The State De
partment has had another brief dispatch
from Santo Domingo under yesterday's
date, confirming the preceding report to
the effect that President Morales was
said to be about fifteen miles west of San
Domingo City, fighting the troops of the
Cabinet. â.'\u25a0- : ' -,\ ~'~:
Mr. Joubert, the Dominican Minister
here, called upon Secretary Root at the
State Department to-day to talk over Do
minican affairs. He had a. short cable
message from Senor Tejera, the Minister,
for Foreign Affairs, announcing that Gen
eral Caceres, the-Vice President, who was
at Puerto Plata': when Morales fled /rom.
the capital, was expected to arrive at San
Domingo City -to-morrow, and would' be
immediately Mnducted' into the . Presiden
tial office:; ;\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0-â¢': â¢'\u25a0"\u25a0'"â¢ \u25a0â¢-.
Joubert; had- nothing to -indicate that
President Morales had been wounded, nor
did he think the fighting. reported to have
taken- place ; near Jaima Tuesday was se
rious. ;'.\u25a0 He ' doubted very much -whether
Morales intended to start another revolu
tion. It was probable, he thought, that
Morales would | wait for a time to see
what effect [ the upheaval in Santo Do
mingo'would have upon. the relations be
tween that country and the United
States. In the Minister's opinion, { the
modus : Vivendi, under/ which . Dominican
customs revenues are now being collected
by Americans appointed by the Domini
can President for that purpose, would not
be affected by Morales' retirement, for
the dominant party in the Cabinet still
stands strongly committed to the existing
arrangement. \ ~

STATE CONTEST
TO OPEN EARLY
Preparations Are Un
for Convention
of Clubs.
Justice M. T. Allen
May Get Supreme
Judgestiip.
. Events are shaping for an early opening
of the gubernatorial campaign of 1506.
Ferd K. Rule of Los Angeles, president
of the California League of Republican
Clubs, has begun preparations for the bi
ennial convention of the league. It would
not surprise the politicians if the con
vention should be as, large and as im
portant as the gathering of club heroes
in San Jose in May, 1902. It is expected
that the leading Republican clubs of San
Francisco, Los Angeles, Oakland, San
Jose, San Diego, Sacramento and of other
cities of the State would send large dele
gations to the biennial convention. In
due time a meeting of the executive com
mittee will be called to make arrange
ments for the first demonstration of the
campaign.
Quite a rivalry for the honor of enter
taining the State nominating convention
of 1906 is already foreshadowed. It is
clear that the leading citizens of Santa
Cruz will present, a proposition to tha
Republican State Committee which the
party representatives can hardly decline.
The proposed new'pavillon on the ocean
beach at Santa. Cruz, : designed especially
for the accommodation \u25a0of large conven
tions, will be ready for occupancy by mid
summer. Santa; Ctuz,is a delightful place
in any, t month /of the- /year and is ex
ceptionally : alluring 'In J August and Sep
tember, when the; weather inland fa hot
fend oppressive! Moreover the" hotel facil
ities of the little city ! by the "sea are
ample and excellent.
/â¢lt is known now that nearly 'all the
State officers and members of Congress
in California will be candidates for re
nomination to their respective positions,
but- animated contests will take place at
several places along the line. It is said
that the Republicans of the region south
of Tehachapl, by reason of their immense
strength', and the unfailing support which
they gave to the "Republican cause in the
close campaign four years ago, will de
mand increased recognition in the make
up of the ticket.
. The appointment of Justice M. T. Allen
of the Court of Appeal, Los Angeles dis
trict, to the State Supreme Court would
not create surprise. It is gossip in the
political camps that Governor Pardee will
select' some well-known lawyer of South- '
em California to fill the : vacancy "caused
by the death of Justice Walter Van Dyke.
. At the general election in November
next the voters will elect three Associate
Justices of the Supreme Court. The term
of twelve years for which Jackson- Tem
ple was elected will expire in January,
1907. Shortly after Temple's death Wil
liam G. Lorisan of San Jose was ap
pointed, on January 5, 1903, to fill tha
vacancy. Subsequently Justice Lorigan
was elected for the unexpired term. It
is common talk that he expects re
nomination and i re-election;. .;u',
In January f 1907, the term for which
Justice F. W. Henshaw was chosen will
expire. It is an open question whether
he will be a candidate for renomination.
There Is talk to the effect that he \u25a0 will
step out In favor of Judge H. A; Melvin.
Word comes from Sonoma County that
Judge A. G. Burnett will be supported
by active and influential delegations,
hence the annpuncement of Justice Hen
shaw's retirement might impart additional
strength' to Judge Burnett's candidacy.
Apart from these three places oa the
Supreme bench there will be nine Ap
pellate Justices to elect, three for each
of the three Courts of Appeal. It is quite
well understood that x the nine Justices
recently ' appointed by Governor Pardee
are candidates for an elective terra. Of
course 'â¢ if Justice Allen of Los Angeles
goes to the Supreme bench some other
lawyer will be appointed to the Appellate
Court of the southern 1 district.

VICTORIA, B. C. Dec 28.â Without
prayers of the clergry, but with due
solemnity, the bodies of throe victims
of the wrecked British bark Pass of
Melfort were buried to-day in the lit
â¢tle grave yard at Un^luelet, a village
a fewj miles distant from the scÂ«sne of
the disaster, which involved the loss
â¢of twenty-six men and one woman.
*J"he villagers gathered at the ceme
tery and knelt in prayer during the in
terment.
The wreck of the Pass of Melfort,
badly broken, is submerged about fifty
yards from the .shore with two spars
ur.chored to it- An Indian is said to
.have seen the vessel firing rockets just
before she foundered. Before dawn on
Tuesday morning: the Indians heard re
ports and rushed otft of their lodges,
but not hearing any further reports
they returned. One states he saw
rickets, which is probably correct, as
ji finall box marked 'rockets" was
â¢ washed ashore. The Indians went to
*L'Â«cluilet fiett lenient, where the set
â¢ tiers were informed that a wreck had
.occurred and both white men and In
dians returned to the scene of disaster.
â¢The steel bark had gone on the reef
â¢to the eastward of Amph'tritc Point,
' 'about lifty yards from the shore. The
wreckage was washed ashore in a small
bay, twenty y;irds wide, with steep,
jagged rooks at the mouth on both
sides. It is fully exposed to the terrific
.southwest gale, which still sweeps
â¢ monstrous seas on to the rocks.
Vhile the settlers were searching
among the wreckage they saw two
bodies, both of which were recovered
with boat hooks. Other bodies were
beaten against the rock but could not
be recovered. It is reported they have
since come ashore. It is considered im
possible for a man to have landed alive
tÂ»o rocky is the vicinity where the
wreck occurred. Cn the rocks a hand
kerchief and collar were found with the
r.atni.- "A. S. Laurie" and a handkerchief
and socks marked with the name "Wor-
Two ot the bodies recovered and
burled are described as follows:
One, height five feet six inches, light
hair, sandy mustache, stars and stripes
tattooed on right arm with circle on flag
and dated ISTS. Second, five feet ten
inches tall, heavy built, about 30 years
old, dark hair end union jack on right
arm.
The first body was Etill bleeding from
ruts on the head, showing death had oc
curred but a short time before. It is
believed that the captain's wife was
among those lost in the wreck, for
"among the miscellaneous wreckage
washed ashore is a woman's gray coat
trimmed with red cord. Scraps of a log
book with the inscription "John Hous
fton. master; Donald Cameron, mate,"
were also found.
Three of the ships boats were washed
â¢ashore.

PORTLAND. Dec. 2S. â The steamer
Homer had a narrow escape while at
tempting to cross out over the bar to
*< Jay, and that the vessel is to-night ly
ing alongside the wharf instead of
â¢ drifting helplessly at sea is due en
tirely to the fact that she is equipped
T^ith twin propellers. The bar was
very rough when the Homer started out
Just after noon and the seas were
breaking clear across. While several
big seas were shipped, good progress
was made until the steamer was on the
Â«:rest of the bar, when her rudder tiller
a. three-inch iron bar, suddenly snapped
in two, rendering the steering gear
useless. Captain Donaldson immedi
Â»Â°jtt*'ly backed the steamer, keeping her
head to the seas, by working the twin
propellers until well inside the line of
.breakers, when he turned her around
end brought her back to the wharf in
this city. Repairs to the rudder are be-
Ing made to-night and the Homer will

WESTERN LINES PLEDGE
THEIR AID TO REFORM
Delegation Headed by Stubbs Calls on
the interstate Board.
HIGH OFFICIAL OF THE HARRIMAN LINES WHO HEADED DELEGATION
WHICH CALLED ON THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE, COMMISSION TO
PLEDGE THE AID OF WESTERN ROADS IN CHECKING REBATE EVIL.
WASHINGTON. Dec 2S.âRepresenta
! lives of the leading Trans-Mississippi
railroads were In conference with the In
terstate Commerce Commission to-day
concerning rates and the efforts of the
commission to do away with discrimina
tion by the railroads In favor of large
shippers.
J. C. Stubbs, vice president and traffic
director of the Harrlman lines, was the
spokesman of the party and held a brief
conference with his associates before
they appeared before the commission.
Chairman Knapp and Commissioners
Cockrell and Clements % were the only
members of th<; Interstate Board present,
the other CommlEsioners being out of the
city. Among the railroad men who at
tended the conference were G. T. Nich
olson, vice president of the Santa Fe; J.
M. Johnson, assistant to the vice presi
dent of the Gould lines, and J. T. Holden,
freight traJHc manager of the Rock
Island.
The conference, which was not public,
lasted for more than two hours. The rep
resentatives ot the railways referred all
Inquiries concerning the meeting to Chair
man Knapp cf the commission, who said
the committee desired the assistance oÂ£
the commission in preventing rebates. Ho
asserted that the representatives of the
different Western roads stated that the
companies are determined to put a stop
to discrimination in favor of large ship
pers.
Through Stubbs and practically all the
oilier members of the committee the rail
way interests were represented as being
anxious to have the commission assist a
} railway committee in looking into all
grievances- Knapp said the speakers
I even expressed a willingness to have such
a committee headed by a man without
railway interests who shall act as the go
| between in a'-l conferences between the
| railway committee' and the commission.
I Several of the railway men assured the
i commission that the public conscience had
been roused by rebate disclosures and
that many prominent shippers have an
nounced they will accept no concessions
of any sort which may cause them to be
classed with corporations which have
profited by special rates. This sentiment,
it was urged by the railway men, will
assist materially in the effort of the rail
ways to abolish rebates.
Knapp and the other two members of
the commission who attended the confer
ence assured the railway men that the
commission will gladly co-operate with
the r?Jlwav interests in stopping rebates
and in investigating: grievances. In re
turn for activity among the railways in
trying to abolish discriminations Chair
man Knapp said the railway committee j
did not ask concessions of any sort from
the commission, but that they desired
co-operation.
The following official statement con
cerning the meeting was made by the
Interstate Commerce Commission:
The conference to-day with "Western railway
official!? was not sought by the commission, as
ceriain papers have Incorrectly stated, but its !
purpose was legitimate and commendable and }
warrants the expectation of beneficial results, j
At a recent meeting in Chicago the representa- I
lives of practically all of the lines \u25a0 weEt of
that city from the border of Canada to the j
gulf adopted the following resolution:
"That a Joint committee, representative of ',
lines In the Western trunk lines committee,
tbe trans -Missouri Freight Bureau, Southwest
ern tariff committee and the transcontinental
freight rate committee, be appointed and In- j
structed to wilt upon the Interstate Commerce j
Commission. ".' The desire and purpose of the i
respective members of said 'committees or bu-i
reaus are to co-operate with the commission >
In the enforcement of the law ; to the 'extent
of pointing out ways and means and. ' giving
the commission any specific Information thac
may com* to lUj knowledge which will lead i
to effective inquiry In uncovering unlawful \u25a0
practices." j
The. object of the Joint committee, whose !
names have already been published, was Ito j
present this resolution and. to assure tbe com
mission of the united and determined disposi
tion of the lines represented to conform to the
law in good faith and in ' every ' respect
and to aid the commission In its enforcement.
Pledges to this effect were given by all present I
with the further promise to report every illegal !
transaction which may come to their knowledge
or of which they may have well-grounded sus
picion.
"While this visit was unsolicited, as above
stated, it was not unwelcome, and the com
mission has zu> reason to doubt the sincerity

TELLS OF TRIP

Captain of Wrecked Whaler
Bonanza Travels to Fort
Eagle With Bold Explorer
CKOSS THE, ICE FIELDS
Daring Norwegian Intends
Sailing for San Francisco
in Early Part of Spring
SEATTLE; Dec. 28.â Captain William
aiogg of the whaling schooner. Bonanza,
\vrecned on Herschel Island a . few
months ago, arrived at Seattle to-day
on the steamship Jefferson. : He walked
soO miles from Herschel island to Fort
Eagle in company* with Ronald Amund
sen of the. schooner' (Jjoa," wno sailed
from Norway through-. â¢ the long-lost
Northwest Passage and who ultimate
ly found the magnetic north pole. Cap
tain Mogg stated that he left the mem
bers of the whaling fleet well, but said
that they would be on short rations
during tne. winter.
Captain. Mogg said that Captain
Amundsen had by this, time started on
his long tramp back to Herschel
Island, and that when the ice broke up
next spring he would sail for San Fran
cisco and from there around the Horn
and across the Atlantic- to "his home
port. Captain Mogg was unable to give
any information that had not already
been telegraphed from Fort Eagle.
Mogg says Captain Amundsen accom
plished all of the matters relative to the
location of the north magnetic pole and
sailed his vessel through the northwest
passage. Amundsen was compelled to
jettison a part of his cargo in order to
accomplish his feat of navigating the
northwest passage, which shows that the
northwest passage, now that it has been
defined, is not deep enough for vessels
sufficiently large for commercial tonnage.
"It will probably be from twelve to fif
teen months before the value of Â»the ob
servations taken by Captain Amundsen
at the north magnetic pole is made
known to the scientific world," said Cap
tain Mogg. "For two years Captain
Amundsen photographed every move
ment of the needle, finding that it moved
back and forth practically in a circle.
The observations were taken with self
reeisterins instruments and no member
of the expedition is able to give the re
sults. This data will be submitted to the
Royal Geographical Society. of London
and to the scientific and geological body
of Norway and Sweden, which assisted
in sending: out the expedition.;
'"There are only about three men in
the world who are able to read the self
registering instruments used by Captain
Amundsen in taking the observations of
the movement of the north magnetic pole.
It is estimated that at least a year, will
be required in compiling the data. Cap
tain Amundsen expects to leave on the
return of the ship Gjoa, which is within
a stone's throw of the wrecked schooner
Bonanza, and plans to bring the Gjoa out
by Bering Straits to San Francisco,
reaching that city early next September.
"Captain Amundsen has already sent
out the observations as registered by the
instruments in sealed copper cans. This
case has been forwarded to London and
will first be examined by the Royal Geo
graphical Society.
"In the measurements of water taken
by Amundsen in the passage the depth of
only, nine feet six- inches was found- at
the place where the Gjoa went -Aground.
As near as could be ascertained by Cap-
taln. Amundsen- there is no greater, depth
of water at any place in. the passage, al
though it is possible that a waterway
may exist where, the passage is entirely
blocked with ict ." â¢ -?

Special Dispatch to The O J.
STOCKTON, .Dec. 28.â Wallace, Cala
veras County, is excited over a big gold
discovery. It has' been found that di
rectly under the town itself there is a de
posit ! of gravel, in an old water course,
rich in coarse gold. The discovery was
made by James Hemerich, who started
to dig a well on his lot last, Sunday.
When down eleven feet he struck a gravel
deposit. He took a dlshpan from- his
home and panned out a little of it. "To
his gratification he got several small nug
gets of gold.
On Christmas afternoon Hemerich took
out and washed six â¢ pans of gravel and
got $15 03 worth of gold. The discovery
started nearly every lot- owner in the
town to digging and nearly all have
found the results profitable. -Women are
at work panning gravel at tubs, al

freezing point.

ST. LOUIS, Dec. 28. â The first at

Laclede J. Howard, whose estate Mrs.
Mary Leafgreen is suing for $250,000
as Ills widow, was made by attorneys
. for the estate to-day when George W.

J. Howard and signed by him.
The same witness also identified in
the order book an entry under date of
January 15. 1653. as being in the band
crofting of Laclede J. Howard.
The significance to this testimony,
according to tne plaintiff's counsel, is
that, according to the testimony of all

testified concerning the marriage of
Mary Moore and Charles Howard, they
were married in Decatur. 111., January

MOSCOW, Dec. 28. â The revolt is
practically ovÂ»r and the strike will be
called off Monday. Comparative quiet
prevailed to-day. Only a few fanatics
are continuing the struggle.
All the members of the social revolu
tionary committee have been arrested
and a quantity of bombs. Infernal ma
chines and correspondence seized.
Three hundred revolutionaries to-day
invaded the residence of the Chief of

LONDON, Dec. 29.â The St. Peters
burg correspondent of the Daily Tele
graph describes as follows the execu
tion of the Chief of Police of Moscow:
.'"The revolutionists entered the lodg
ing of the Chief of Police at midnight
and told him to bid an eternal farewell
to his family, because he was con
demned to die. Finding that It was no
joke the Chief expostulated, but' to no
purpose.
"Realizing his awful position, he eai.l
farewell to his family and was hurried
into the street and shot. His body was
left lying in a pool of blood."
The same correspondent relates as
follows the terrible operations of the
"Vehmgerichte" in Riga:
"Tht persons disappeared mysterious
ly and a few days afterward their bodies
were ,'ound with identical marks â four
bullet wounds on the breast, four on
the back and the skull cloven in twain.
Of the many brought before the "Vehm
gerichte' one escaped death, but in so
doing he was seriously wounded, prob
ably owing to pome Interruption of hiÂ«
executioners. This person says that he
was seized and bound and hurried to
the room. in which the tribunal was sit
ting. The proceedings were brief. He
â¢was condemned to death, carried to the
outskirts of the town, laid flat on the
ground and shot."
CRUSHING OF THE REVOLT.
MOSCOW, . Wednesday, Dec. [27. â The
backbone of â¢ the Insurrection Is broken
and the rising !s rapidly going to pieces.
The revolutionists are able to keep up
only a guerilla warfare, but the ' ease
with which they can move small detach
ments from place to place renders the
task of suppressing them slow and tedi
ous. . '\u25a0_\u25a0:
All the troops of the Moscow garrison,
including the former disaffected Rostoft
Grenadiers and the reinforcements which
are employed In crushing the revolution
ists, are still Insufficient to thoroughly
occupy the territory won, thus enabling,
the revolutionists to slip into vacated
territory as soon os, the; troops move â¢ oh.
Many of the attacks on patrols are seem
ingly, made out of a pure spirit of brav
ado, since they are completely futile from
a strategic standpoint.: The remnants of
the insurrection now lack cohesion or a
head.
The city of Moscow, bears the pictur
esque appearance of a battlefield. -Officers
are everywhere seen j galloping through
the streets or being driven, about in, rap
idly; moving : sleighs,, uccompanted by es
corts of dragoons or. Cossacks. . ;
The troops began operations this
ing at the .Triumphal Arch, bombarding
and demolishing an- immense barricade

pany which has been, built behind: over

Brunnaya district disclosed many inter
esting traces of yesterday's fighting,
which brought- the walls of a hundred
houses tumbling about the ears of their
defenders. The Prokhorff cotton mill,
the headquarters of the "Drujina." and
many other houses, for a distance of a
mile between the Boulevard and the Tri
umphal Arch, were in ruins. Every street
tributary of the Tverskaia boulevard was
stoutly barricaded, as many as seven
barricades being counted within 200 yards
of . a single street. These evidently
formed the first line of defense and the
network of streets behind were barri
caded at Intervals. These, barricades
were left standing, the troops having
strategically . made a circuit to an open
plain northwest of the city, which en :
abled them to take the 'revolutionists in
the rear', compelling. the evacuation of
the position practically without loss, as
the revolutionists were unable to fight
the artillery with revolvers, and. they
possessed few rifles. *
House after house showed yawning
chasms produced by shells, i The spirit
shops and cheap lodging houses occupied
by the student; revolutionists .were the
principal sufferers.- The barricades,
though they could not be defended
against artillery, were well constructed
of telegraph poles, fences, heavy, doors,
Iron courtyard gates and signs, all inter
laced with wire. A lumber, yard In the
vicinity : supplied material for thirty bar
ricades. : Red â¢ flags were still defiantly
floating over some of the defenses..
During the morning the revolutionists
"several times attempted to Intercept con
voys of ammunition sent from the arsenal
to the troop's, whos? supply of ; 200 rounds
per . man was running low. In ' one case
they almost | succeeded, after which the
escorts of the convoys were doubled.
The boldest exploit to the credit of the
revolutionists was an attack on the, din
ner of the Fourth, Grenadiers, which; was
being trundled out in the wheeled camp
kitchens used . in the . Russian army. A
detachment of the "Drujina," aided by

ST. PETERSBURG. Dec. 29. l:U0 a. m.â
The Bourse Gazette this morning prints
a rumor that Ueutenant General Mist
chenko, while in -the streets of Moscow,
was wounded by a stray bullet, Th<s
paper also prints a rumor that Count
Vorontzoff-Deshoff. Viceroy of the Cau
casus, has been recalled on account oC
his failure to pacify the district.
According to advices received by the
Government lust night the "rebellion"" at
Moscow was entering on It 3 final stage.
The same guerrilla warfare was continued
yesterday, but on a smaller scale. Gov
ernor General Doubassoff is acting with
great energy and hundreds of members
of the Drujina are already behind the
bars. The strikers have lost heart and
the Workmen's Council is considering the
question of calling off the strike.
The principal danger seems to be that
the "black hundreds" will complete the
work begun, by the troops and end the
revolt with a horrible massacre. The
lower classes are represented as enraged
at the attempt of the revolutionaries to
overthrow the Emperor, and, even with
the best Intentions, it may be impossible
for the authorities to restrain the fury of
these classes, once the opportunity is
offered them. The attacks made on strik
ing railroad men at wayside stations suf
ficiently shows the temper of the peasant
class. * \u0084 ' ]' '..'"
Four thousand strikers marched out of
Moscow and completely destroyed sev

St. Petersburg and Moscow, thirty miles
outside of Moscow, in order to prevent
the arrival of troop trains bearing the
Seminovsky Battalion of the Horse Guard,
and the trains backed twenty miles to
Cline. whence. It is understood, the troops
will proceed on foot for their destination.

Bush Frlel, whose sobriquet of "Brick"
was explained by his russet com
; plexion, the animal's claws had cut
many figures In the countenance
which he presented when Police Judge

Scarcely half an Inch of H,ls facial

across his neck.

"Cat," was Mr. Friel's equally terse
reply. "But," he added, after a mo
ment's pause, during which he tenderly
fingered his deepest and longest lace
â¢ ration, "a woman chucked th* cat at
me."
"I was sure that a woman had some
thing to <3o with it,"" rejoined the court
officer, with a smirk indicative of pride
In his acute perspicacity.
On motion of Mr. Friel's attorney, the
. charge of grand larceny filed by Frank
Euberg of 200 Howard street went
over for hearing until January 3, and
the details of Mr. Friel's encounter
with the cat were thus shut out, to the
palpable disappointment of a crowded
auditorium. From statements piade
by Mr. Friel to some of his fellow
prisoners, however, it was ascertained
lhat on the evening- of the alleged rob
bery he was under alcoholic influence
and went to extend the compliments of
â¢ the holiday season to one of his femi
nine acquaintances, residing on Ellis
.street. His manner of address must
liave been offensive to the lady, for
\u25a0with astonishing accuracy of aim she
â¢. hurled at bis face a cat which she had
been fondling: in her lap.
"Th* pussy seemed to hit me in fifty

Mr. Friel could ascribe only to a mir
acle the fact that his eyeballs escaped
extraction, as several scratches were
very close to his organs of vision.
Ere he fell into evil repute Mr. Frlel
attained some distinction as an ama
teur boxer, but his fame as an athlete
waned apace with the waxing of his
notoriety as a lawbreaker. He has

GU7LR7INTY OF MERIT,
When the maker of a medicine, sold
through druggists for family use, takes
his patients fuily Into his confidence by
frankly and fearlessly publishing broad-
cast as well ac on its oottle wrappers,
a full list of all its ingredients in plain
English, this action on his part is the
best possible evidence that he is not
afraid to have the search light of inves-
tigation turned full upon nis formula
and that it will bear the fullest scrutiny
and the most thorough Investigation.

his full confidence by such open and
honest publicity.
A glance at the published Ingredients
on each battle wrapper, will show that It
is made wholly from native, American,
medicinal root*, that It contains no poi-
sonous or habit-forming drugs, no nar-
cotics and no alcoholâ pure, triple-refined
glycerine, of proper strength being used
instead of the commonly employed alco-
hol, both for extracting and preserving
the active medicinal properties found in.
the roots of the American forest plants
employed, ft is the only medicine for
women's pecular diseases, sold by drug-
gists, that does not contain a large per-
centage of alcohol, which Is In the long
run so harmful to woman's delicate, nerv-
ous svetem. Now, glycerine is perfectly
harmless, and serves a valuable purpose
by possessing intrinsic value all its own,
ana besides it enhances the curative
effect of the other ingredients entering
Into the "Favorite Prescription."
Some of the ablest medical writers and
teachers endorse these views and praise
all the several Ingredients of which "Fa-
vorite Prescription" is composed â rec-
ommending them for the cure, of the
very same diseases for which this world-
famed medicine is advised. â¢ No other

sumers of Italian dinners did Jesse Lltch
neld and Benjamin Brown, putative news
paper illustrators, attribute the reckless
| ness of spirit that possessed them when
they "lifted" several red lanterns which
had been placed as danger signals on
lumber stacks adjacent to the site of the
proposed St. Francis Hotel extension, on
Powell street, near Post. The arresting
policeman told Judge Fritz that when he
met the two young men they were laden
with lanterns, which they swung a la
Indian clubs, and thus created an ani
mated illuminative effect that was pretty
but embarrassing to drivers of vehicles,
who were on the lookout for warning
lights in the darkness.
"Was it artistic impulse that led you
toâ toâ borrow the lamps?" the Judge
asked tbe defendants.
'Well, yes; in a way it was," one of
them replied. "But, cf course," he added,
'If we had been perfectly sober we
wouldn't have borrowed them at all."
Then be told of the commixing of beer
with "dajo red."
"What did you Intend to do with yourâ
ahâ plunder?" inauired the court.
"We were going to visit a friend of
ours who had a Christmas tree at his
home," was the answer, "and when we
saw the lanterns we thought they would
look well on the tree. Of course, we didn't
mean to steal the things."
"I am Inclined to believe that you were
impelled by mischievous Instead of larcen
ous prompting," said his Honor, "and my
order of dismissal Is -accompanied by an
opinion that it was unwise of. you to in
troduce a malt beverage to the tipple
served with* Italian dinners, which, though
cheap In price, is a haughty and unso
ciable wine."
Mrs. Laura Harris, who abandoned her
husband, a horticulturist, and two chil
dren at Ukiah to elope with a negro bar
ber, was released by Judge Fritz at re
quest of her brother, who promised to
take her back to Mendocino County and
keep her at his home. Her dusky para
mour, who Is accused of vagrancy, has
demanded a jury trial, and the Judge Is
considering tbe advisability of granting
the demand.

Sealskin-sacqued and picture-hatted,
Mrs. King recounted in fuller detail
the foregoing domestic Incident to
Judge Cabanlss. before whom she ac
cused her husband of battery. "I was

added, "when he told me to shut up

interrogatively.

"Ah, yes," murmured the court.
"Then he ups with the plate," Mrs.
King resumed, "and breaks it on my

"Really, you must pardon me again,"
quoth his Honor. "Where did the plate
strike?"
"On my nut â my head, you know,"
Mrs. King explained, peevishly. "He

"A year and a half, you mean," Mr.
King put in softly. #
"I said ten years," Mrs. King re
joined firmly, "and I repeat that we've

"It'll all come out In the divorce

"You bet it will," she rejoined, snap

Mr. King did not deny the battery,
but pleaded that It was more than Jus

by the complainant when he mildly re
quested her to talk less and eat more.
"I keep a rooming-house," he added,
"and when I proposed that we divide
the property and separate she told me
she would take nothing less than the
whole cheese."
"By which she meant?" his Honor
plaintively said, with an inquiring
look.
"Why, that she would take the whole
property or nothing, of course," Mr.
King explained, with a pitying glance
at the^bench.

NAPOLI SPEAKS
IN OWN BEHALF
Accused Murderer and Bravo
Is Placed on the Witness
Chair to Give Testimony-
HE SEEKS EXCULPATION
Says That He Was Only by
Accident in Vicinity and
Did Not Help in the Killing
Angelo Napoli, wrestler and fisherman,
accused murderer of Giuseppe -Brogardo,
was put on the stand by / his attorney at
the third day of his. trial yesterday after
noon. He aat squarely in his chair, hiÂ»
short body bunched up in lines; of squat
power. His hands, which are .the, handa
of , a wrestler, "muscular; almost" to de
formity, were clasped tight - between" his
knees. He talked with an Italiaa accent
and \u25a0.vehemently.-.. As on the first* day, he
was ptill under the torture of : a high col
lar, ,â¢ and his head . Jerked froni side . to
side, his lips twitching.
Hig story, which To the defense is truth
and to the prosecution "a manifest lie,
was unshakable to Assistant District At
torney Whiting's : best efforts. ; Napoli
said that, at II o'clock on the night' of
the murder, accompanied \by Salvator #
Strn.no, ho went to" tho fish store of his*
brother, Mattso ; Napoli, j and there par
took of boiled crab" and some fried oys-'
ters. At 11 :30 they started home. On Ma
son street, a block and a half south -of
the barber shop ' of Pietro Rala," they
stopped to talk to a friend named Sano.
Strano left, saying he was going home.
Napoli remained, talking, about ten min
utes longer, and. was still . on" the- spot
when a fusillade of shots rang in the di
rection of the Raia barber shop. â¢
"I hear shot," said Napoli. "I look and
uet> lots of people running in front of the
barber shop. Lots of people begin run
ning down the street,' and I run, too,
after them. I run to the corner of Fran
ctsco. Lois of people there. I say ..' What's
da mattah, what's de mattahT They say,
'I don't know, I don't know.' Then a po
licaman he come and , say, 'One . Italian
rean dead. Do you know?* "I go * with
him tn Vande water street, and Brogardo
is there, dead. Roaario Domini, his friend,
is there, and he begin to cry. . k The police
man say, 'Do you, know, him, the man
that's dead?' I say, 'Yes, that's Bro
gardo.' "
SAYS HE INTERPRETED.
After that, Napoli claimed, he was one
of the crowd that followed the policemen
iv their investigation^ and he helped them
by interpreting. Under eioss-examination
he stoutly held to his story ..very restive
to the prodding, of repeated questions. He
denied ever having. had trouble with Bro-
K'ardo before; said he knew, him by sight
only. He denied that he had . ever com
plained of having been driven out of
Alaska by Brogardo, and affirmed that
while in Alaska he and Brogardo worked
for different companies in different . parts
of the country.
The most important testimony for.
the prosecution was that of Pietro
Rala, the proprietor, of the barber
shop, where was taking place the cele
bration that ended in the bloody trag
edy. Rala said that. twenty minutes
after the fusillade that ended in Bro-.
gardo's death Angelo Napoli-came into
! the shop and asked , the , barber â¢ to
shave off his mustache! Raia demurred
at first, saying that.' it was too "late
and that he was not sober, then oon
sented and clipped them off. This
dovetails with the previous testimony.
of Thomas Shea, Thomas Shea is the
young machine hand who, with W. E.
Welsse, was given the custody of Sal
vator Strano by Policeman; Fenner
while that officer ran on In pursuit of
Andrea Brasilo. The prisoner was
torn out of the hands of the two citi
zen custodians by a man whom they
claim was Napoli. Shea testified that
at the time of the forced deliverance
Napoli had a thick, black mustache,
but that when he saw him again an
hour later the mustache was gone.
Raia testified also that he heard
Napoli when put in the patrol wagon,
say to his fellow-suspects, "Boya. be
careful what you say or it will be
worse for you." " A few weeks after
the murder Napoli came to him and
they talked about the affair. Rala
told Napoli that Gualappl had said that
he, Napoli, was guilty of the murder.
On the spot Napoli dictated a note- to
Rala to be given to the accuser. The
note" was Introduced as evidence.- It
Is scribbled in Italian and 'unsigned.
Translated, It reads, "Now boys, don't
talk different. If you do it will be
worse for you."
GL.OOH IN COURT. i
One of the most interesting bits of
testimony was that of Mrs. D. An
dreas. It brought Into the courtroom
some of the gloomy atmosphere of the
night of January 22. Mrs. Andreas

the house before the gate of which
Brogardo ended his desperate flight in

MONEY TAKES
A HIGH FLIGHT
Call Loans in New York Go
Up With Rush to Hundred
and. Twenty-Eive Per Cent
NEW YORK, Dec. 28.â The call money
market opened strong again to-day. The
first loan reported was $2,800,000 at the
rate of 30 ncr cent per annum, and this
\u25a0was followed almost immediately by an
other loan' of $300,000 at 60 percent. The
advance in the interest rate was sensa
tionally rapid.' From 60 there was a quick
advance to 75, 90 and then 100 per cent.
When , 100 per cent was touched all rec
ords since December, 1899, were broken.
In that year IS6 per cent was paid for call
loans. After landing at 100 per cent to
day there were loans at 90 per cent. The
90 per cent quotation * did not ' last long,
and at 11 o'clock 110 per' cent waÂ» paid
for funds,' "and - ; shortly afterward a loan
of $400,000 at 125 per cent was reported.'
Although brokers were compelled to'pay
the highest prices in years for cash with
which to carry their stock, there was lit
tle excitement over the situation. Many
Stock ' Exchange houses provided them
selves several months ago with time loans
to carry them over January 1, -.which is a
time when money is always In great de
mand for,, dividends, interest and other
year-end settlements. These time loans
are not afteoted by the call money mar
ket. /\u25a0 â¢ : \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0â¢\u25a0\u25a0. -' : -\i
Bomo stocks were sold out during the
morning hours, ' principally.; Industrials,
but In the < main stocks ; held well in - the
early \u25a0 trading, considering the market's
usual sensitiveness ' to money conditions.
On' the .Stock Exchange the view was
taken ; that | the stringency Is temporary,'
and . that easier conditions .will prevail
immediately after. January L \u0084". \u0084 .
The demand for money started within
fifteen minutes after the opening of busi
ness.? As a rule nothing is done in money,
until after 11 o'clock. ; To-day, a loan was
ma.de .early at 80 per; cent. : This was re
garded as an effort to keep the rate down.
Immediately 7 afterward bids were raised
between quotations. A request for, accom
modation ; at : 40 per ; cent .brought ' no offer. 1
Then ; the bid was . raised to 50, with 7 no
better results. The next was 60, at which
figure ; a second loan was made, one '.of
$200,000. No more money was offered at
that rate. .The third loan was made at
70 percent. - , .
Then the demand for, money from brok
ers, as a result of, heavy "calling, of loans
by i the :' banks. In order \u25a0to make arrange
ments for ; the January 1 disbursements,
became' urgent-, and. most ..'of ,' them were
apprehensive' as^tb whether they could re
new their loan* at allJ / The call rate then
climbed' rapidly to 80, 90 and 125 per cent.
The top : rate yesterday was 95 per cent.' â¢
Russell ~i Sage,' through ; his representa
tive," was reported .to have loaned $3,000,
ouo:at-90 to-lOOper, cent. . More than ? the
usual discrimination was shown .by the
banks "t ln .', the collateral accepted by them
forloans; " -_ '.'"\u25a0.'.'\u25a0 . - ;
â¢Vij The' rate for slxty^ and . ninety day , loans
to-day was :6 per cent,' and a commission,

ARMY COURT
TRIES TAYLOR
Sergeant Butler Describes
His Humiliation by the
Lieutenant in a Theater
Special Dispatch to The Call.
â¢'NEW; YORK, Dec 28.â Lieutenant Roy
L Taylor, One Hundred and Twenty-fifth
United States Coast Artillery, was tried
by court martial In the army building,
Whitehall street, to-day on the charge
that he had compelled an enlisted man
to change his seat in a theater so, that
he would not be directly in -front, of the
lieutenant and ladles. -: The - technical
charge was conduct prejudicial to good
order and discipline. Ths decision of the
court will be submitted to General ' Grant

asked Camain BkarreL
"No, sir; but as he was my commanding
officer I thoug-h: I had better comply."
"What words did he use?"
"Tan had better/"
Lieutenant Taylor testified that he had
only wished to keep a family party to
gether and had told the sergeant that his
asking him to change his seat was not
an order, but a personal request. He had
thought the matter ended until Butler
had written a letter of complaint. He
said It was furthest from his mind to
embarrass the sergeant.
"Would you have made the same re
quest of a citizen?" asked Captain Sker
ret.
"Yes." was tha answer.
"Suppose you were sitting In a theater
and the sergeant asked you to change,
what would you do?"

GOVERNOR PARDEE URGES
EDUCATION FOR BOYS.
Tells Farmers Their
Sons Go Forth
Unripe.
Chief Executive Says
Young Men Need
Schooling.
Protests Against Taking
Youth Away From
BERKELEY, Dec. 2S.â With the eye of.]
an â¢xpert. Dr. A. C. True of the agrl- .
cultural department at Washington, D. C I
haa surveyed the field for agricultural
instruction in California and to-day read ] '
a paper on tha subject before the joint :
\u25a0Msion of the State Farmers' Institute j
and tha nature study department of the 1
Teachers' Association. He discussed the {
work of the agricultural experiment sta- !
tlons which are in his charge as a Gov- '
emment official; gave a summary of con
ditions In the East, where agricultural
Instruction is concerned; recommended
co-operation of all bodies or persons In- |
terested In agricultural study; suggested :
tha organization of more such institutions
as the Polytechnic School at San Luis
Oblspo, calling them secondary schools,
and urged patience In the matter of de
ciding whether elementary agricultural
Instruction is feasible.
Governor Pardee read a paper before
the Joint session, dealing with statistics |
that show how comparatively few boys
of California graduate from grammar
or high school?, arguing that the failure
to continue ie school until graduation
deprives boys of discipline, leaving them
measurably lawless and liable to become
criminally worthless, as Is evidenced by
the crowth of crime among the young
men of the State. Governor Pardee stated
the facts and suggested that the expert
educators present consider the problem
Involved, incidentally asking that the
farmers keep their boys In school as long.
â¢as possible because euch schooling will
tend to make them more contented with
farm life, less liable to drift to the city,
ivhere temptation awaits them, and be
cause Justice to the boys demands that:
they have such school opportunities.
In the afternoon Professor E. W. Hil
grard, authority on soil problems, revered
for his long term of service to the State
and esteemed for his great ability as a
foil expert, spoke on the best means of
utilizing the depth of our soils.
PLEADS FOR THE BOYS.
Governor Pardee used figures to show
how boys leave the schools In. increasing
numbers as the higher grades are
reached,. his remarks on this phase of his
subject, being as follows:
TbÂ«-e'must be something wrong wnen the
184. 436 boys and girls in thÂ» pfrus.ry grades
dwindle away to 301,228 in the grammar
grades; therÂ« is something wrong when the
average 24,394 boys and 21.715 girls per
primary grade dwindle down to an average of
IO,GSI beva and 10.1C4 atlrls per grammar
grade; there is something wronr when tbe
average excess of boy* over girts of 2&79 per
primary grade entirely disappears in the
grammar grades, to be replaced by an aver
ags excess per grade of eighty-three girls.
The figures are not to be had to prove it. bat
it iÂ« Kafe to say that the jrreateat lots of
boj-8 and girls occurs in the higber jrrades of
the grammar schools; and that the boys, the
very one* who "ne*d most' the discipline of the
schools, quit them before they should.
Making due allowances for increase in popu
lation, deaths, poverty, removals and what
net is It not a startling and a shameful thing
\u25a0 that of 20.000 boys who probably began in the
rrtraary schools nine years ago, only 4500 went'
through the grammar â¢chools? What became

from- the grammar schools? And what be
came of the 19.000 boys who thirteen years ago
entered the primary echools and did not grad
uate from tbe high schools? Of the 20,000
boy* who probably entered the primary school*
nine year* ago. only 22', per cent graduated
from th* crammer Â»choolÂ«. Why did not the
other 77 1u per cent compl*te the course?
What has become of our boys? Only a
srnrill percentage of thernÂ«acqu!re that disciple,
a important. I think as m<*re book learning.
Too many of our farmert. think that they can
rot soar* thÂ» boy from farm work for all
the years in which he should be at school. "I
nÂ«pfl htm nn the farm," . they cay; and then
they wonder wtiy the boy is eagtr to leave the
c country, where his work apparently â¢ receives
do recognition, to go to the cities, where he
ran cam and epeaA men* wages, such wages
ar to him appear magnlfioent.
I wtab that something more could be done
for the country schools. I wish that our 'farm
ers could realize that for their boys and girls
long school yearn and many of them are neces
sary and that as it is the farmer's business to
tiU the farm I from which jbÂ« allows nothing
to distract . his attention co his boss and
daughter* should have no other business to
attend to than their schools. I wish that our
farmer* could realise how necessary the echoo 1
discipline is and when they do so reailze on*,
strtog element that will operate to keep the
country boys and girls at home will have beea
achieved.
Dr. ; A; C. True's paper on "A System
of Agricultural Education for California"
was In part as follows:
The rradnate end undergraduate instruction
in the College of Agriculture should be on a
nar with that in the other colleres cf tha
university, and should have for Its purpose
the preparation of the leader* la agricultural
progress, the invertigatorsi, teachers. State of
ficial*. Â«dttor* and managers of great agri
cultural enterprises. In the graduate Instruc
tion foeclsl etrees should be laid on the die
tinctire agricultural Interests of thÂ» . State.
For example, California University might nat
trally be expected to have a strong gradu
ate department of horticulture. . ,
OccaeJonaUy we hear persons advocating thÂ»
separation of the College of Agricajture I from
the university, but this usually proceeds from
a mistaken idea regarding the functions of an
agricultural college or from an lenoranw of
the present tendencies of higher education
in sericulture In this country. As . tre,' shall

WHO ADDRESSED THE FARM- J
ERS' INSTITXTTE TESTERDAT. |
agriculture will go hand in hand with the
best development of other industries ana so
cial and leeal Institutions. .
O>*liY ONE COLLEGE. .
In this connection it is well to remember
that there Is only one purely agricultural col
lee* in the United States. MoÂ»t of the aeri
cultural and mechanical colleges approximate
the State universities In the range of - taeir
courses of instruction. This Is particularly true
of the most euccessful airrlcultural colleges. |
In the early days varioun circumstances lea 1
to the establishment of the so-called aert- >
cultural colleges in a number of States as 1
separate Institutions, but this movement has |
Bpent its force and the tendency now is ,
toward consolidation ot higher education In
various llnea In broad institution*.- Lately
two of the agricultural colleges have become
State universities. Some of our more oopu
lous and wealthy States may develop their
agricultural and mechanical colleges Into sec
ond Stata universities, and this has- actually
occurred In Indiana. Moreover, agricultural
education and research have of late been put
on a ctrons: footing in a number of univer
sities, notably In Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin.
Minnesota, Missouri. Nebraska and New lork,
thua destroying the argument that agricultural
instruction cannot prosper In a university.
In view of these things California should
esteem herself fortunate In having already
consolidated public higher education In \u25a0 her
State University, and the friends of agricul
tural education should rally round the Col
lege of Agriculture of the university and help
to make it in every way worthy of the vast
agricultural interests and possibilities of this
"'in addition to the agricultural college! a
number of rural high echools should be estab
lished in which agriculture the sciences
related thereto should be leading subjects of
instruction. TbesÂ« achools should be equipped
with laboratories, shops and taxvas.^^ The in
struction in agriculture should be both theo
retical and practical, bnt with thft special aim
of sending out men and women well equipped
for successful careers ob the farms. It Is bet
ter not to make, these schools exclusively ag
ricultural. Course* In manual training and
domestic arts ehould tie provided, as well aÂ«
ra , thÂ« subjects ordinarily taught in high
&cliools> \u25a0 '
The regular course for graduation should oc
cupy four years, and agricultural subjects
chould constitute about otic- third of the curri
culum. Provision should also -be made for
Ehorter and special courses, especially courses
of two or three years, in which practical In
struction will bÂ« given right of. way, Gradu
ates in agricultural courses should be admitted
to the college of agriculture of the university,
proper credit being given them for their attain
ments In agricultural itudie*. v â¢-
The teachers of agricultural subjects In these
rural high schools snould be graduates of agri
cultural colleges. And the teachers of otlwr
subjects . should be selected with. special refer
ence to their knowledge and love of rural life.
In general every effort should be made to
create in these echools an atmosphere favorable
to rural life and pursuits..
The number of these scnools will Â«ventually
depend on the demand for education of this
character in the rural communities. I am in
clined to think that under present conditions
tha county Is too small a tmit. It will bÂ« bet
ter to hare fewer schools, since it is desirable'
to have a good sized faculty, ample equipment
and relatively large attendance in each of these
â¢chools.
California. already, has, one each school, the
Polytechnic School at". San Luis Obispa ,Thls
now has an enrollment of 100 students. \u25a0 It
four or Sva additional i-choola of this kind were
established and properly located with reference
to transportation facilities and regional differ
ences, probably the needs of the rural popula
tion of California In this direction would be
sufficiently met for a number of years. .
In a. few States agricultural high schools hayÂ»
been established In connection with the agri
cultural colleges. .
Besides agricultural courses in special rural
high schools. It would be well for ''union dis
tricts" and city high schools located near rural
communities to Introduce instruction In nature
study and agriculture, just ac they are Intro
ducing manual' training and domestic arts.
This would ordinarily mean that at least. on*
agricultural- college graduate should be â¢ added
to the faculty and a garden and other facilities
I for agricultural instruction ehould.be provided
] at the school. . Many villages and cities of
California are very largejy dependent for their \u25a0
prosperity on the farms, orchards , and vine
yards by : which they are surrounded.:: It is
highly absurd and shortsighted for these com
munities to make their high schools centers of
instruction in all sorts of subjects. relating to
urban Industries and professions and to utterly
neglect to give instruction - tending to make
the agriculture and horticulture on which their
very existence depends more highly and perma
nently remunerative.
XOIOfAIi SCHOOLS ADVISED. â¢;
The normal schools will also find it desirable
to give attention. to the training of teachers In
agricultural subjects as supplementary to -what
they are already doing in what is ordinarily
called nature study, which in fact is more or
lees closely related to agriculture. -Teachers
for the rural schools may be prepared to 'give
Instruction in the elements of agriculture by
the combined efforts \u25a0 of the ': normal schools, \u25a0
rural high schools and : agricultural colleges
through special or summer courses at the high
schools and coTTcge to supplement the peda
gogical instruction at the normal school?, .

agriculture Into ths rural common schools 1*
undoubtedly attended with great difficulties.
Nevertheless, since about 05 per cent ofitfas
rural children do not get beyond the common
schools, it is highly important that a serious
and sustained effort should be made to make
these schools instrumental in tho broadening
and uplifting of farm life\and the greater pros
perity of agriculture and horticulture through
out the State. Legislation . relating to these
schools should permit and encourage Instruction
in nature study and agriculture. Experiments

favorable conditions as possible. Advances in
this direction, however Imperfect, should be

ANVIL CHORUS
FOR STUDENTS
Din of 3letal Works and
Xoise of Boiler Shops as an
Adjunct to Study Hours
Unique conditions are about to attend
the progress of education at the Califor
nia School of Mechanical Arts in the Po
trero. Recitations must be carried on in
competition with the din and clangor of a
boiler shop and sheet metal works which
have recently been put into commission
at a distance of less than 100 feet from
the class rooms of the school. Within the
radius of a city block and, in several In
stances, directly across the street from
the school, are factories ranging in char
acter from a soap factory to a boiler
shop, including acid works, paint and
varnish concerns and the city crematory.
The boiler and sheet metal works which
are the latest additions to the noisy ring
of neighbors bid fair to raise the biggest
"anvil chorus" on record, inasmuch as
they are both directly adjacent 'to the
school property in front and in the rear.
The metal shop, wh'.ch is the new loca
tion of the Forderer Cornice Works, for
many years at 8 and 10 Natoma street,
has not opened in the new building, front
ing on Potrero avenue and extending to
I'tah. but as the date set for the installa
tion Is a month overdue it is probable
that when the faculty and students re
turn to the school January 3 they will
find the automatic trip hammers ready
with a noisy welcome.
The Iron and Steel Contracting Com
pany's boiler and tank concern is in ac
tion, but the racket raised now is but a
suggestion of the clangor to come when
the other two-thirds of the regular force
of sixty riveters begin operations.
The school property, which includes the
entire block bounded by Utah and Ne
braska and Fifteenth and Sixteenth
streets. Is valuable. The capacity of the
Institution is rapidly being enlarged to
meet the Increasing demand. The aca-,
demic and shop buildings were originally
two-story brick affairs, but plans have
been drawn up by which all will be made
a story higher. This improvement, in ad
dition to the electrical building under
construction and an extension of the
main building, will form a continuous
structure along the entire frontage on
Utah street. These extensive modifica
tions signify that the work of educating
several hundred boys and girls annually
will be carried on. regardless of a con
centration of noises that might generally
be regarded as a stumbling bloyk to
study. ;. )
Danes to Hold Holiday Fentlval.
The society of the Danish Brother
hood and Sisterhood will hold a Christ
mas tree festival at Saratoga Hall to
morrow evening. Thje hours between
8 and 10 p. m. will be devoted to tht>
children, who will hold high carnival
about a handsomely bedecked Christ
mas tree that is to be provided for
them. At 10* o'clock and thereafter
dancing will be in order and it Is
then when the older folk will make
merry enjoying that pastime.

Globe Company Seeks to Have
Commissioner Restrained
From Revoking Certificate
E. Myron Wolf, State Insurance Com
missioner, was last night served with an
Injunction from Judge Morrow's depart
ment of the United States Circuit Court
of Appeals, prohibiting him from revok

in every case, save that of the Globe.
Wolf says that thÂ£ Globe Company owes
the State back taxefe since IÂ£S2. He "has
been making an attempt to collect this
sum for many months, but the compaoy
has always shown fight, though other
concerns have acceded to his demands
and paid over the tax money. .
Commissioner Wolf says that some time
ago Charles Page, attorney for the Globe

la Settled.
Oscar Dane Messing, an actor, who
is at the head of a "Dr. Jekyll and Mr.

day by a deputy. Sheriff on complaint
of Dr. Henry H. Hart, who alleged
that Messing; who owes ; him a bill of
9250, was about to leave the State, with
the intention of defrauding his credit
ors. Messing appeared before Justice

that such was .the, case, but admitted
that his trunks were at the Santa ;Fe

KILLS HIHSELF
IN FERRY NAVE
Discouraged/ Henry Miller,
a Pennsylvania!!, Ends His
Life '\u25a0â¢ With a Bullet
LITTLE -CLEW TO DEED
Brief Comment -on an En
velope Says x "TUis Letter
Makes Me Desperate"
Awaiting: until the nave of the ferry
building was deserted, John August Mil
ler of Providence, :Pa., put; an end to his
life yesterday afternoon by shooting him
self. The desperate act was committed In
the extreme southern end of the nave
shortly before 3 o'clock,; and; hardly had
the echo of the pistol shot died away be
fore police and. citizens surrounded the
dead man. No motive can be ascribed to
the deed except a; single line penciled on
the back of an empty. envelope found In
Miller's room at the Hotel Terminus.
Five words written by . the suicide elo
quently speak of hiÂ« mental struggle.
"This letter makes me desperate." What
the letter was will: never be, known, as
Miller probably destroyed it; before end
ing his life.'. 1 The postmark on the envel
ope was dated Dixon^ 111., December 21.
A curious circumstance is that the direc
tion was P^ J. Millar. -misspelling;" both
name and -initials. .-',"\u25a0 f-
Despite the fact that : the nave 'of the
ferry tiuildingr is thronged with. people, no
one was present at the time Miller fired
the fatal shot. At the sound of the re
volver Policeman Thompson bounded up^
the main stairs and ran to the fallen man
far down the corridor.; When the.police
man arrived life was extinct: A. hurry
call brought the Harbor Emergency Hos
pital, but one glance .sufficed to show that
the man was beyond the doctor's care."
By this time the shooting was' noised
along the water front and curious crowds
began flocking to the. scene. The rumor
gained currency that George D. : Collins
had killed himself and this gossip attract
ed additional crowds..' Several policemen
were detailed by Sergeant Campbell to
keep the morbid ones back.
Just as the. Coroner's wagon arrived a
weeping and hysterical woman in travel
ing dress broke from the crowd, and de
manded to see the body. As the police
drew back the woman's feeling gave way
and she refused to view the corpse. A
description of the dead man was fur
nished her. and, declaring that It was not
the man she was looking for, the Woman
left the building. . .
Miller was neatly but inexpensively
dressed, everything appearing \u25a0\u25a0 newly
bought. On the lapel of hi.? 'coat he wore
a small wax rose pin and a cheap pin in
his scarf. On his vest.he wore a ; tin
type of himself and on his finger a heavy
gold ring. A silver watch and small note
book were found in his pocket. In the
book were the names of northern cltiep,
indicating that he had come to San Fran
cisco by the Southern Pacific. The hat
was purchased in Seattle and a beautiful
bearskin overcoat was found In his room.
A new violin of cheap make was also
found. The: body was taken to .the
Morgue. . ' Â» . l-

The young people of .the Plymouth
Congregational Church on Post street
rendered a brilliant and catchy cantata,
entitled "Santa Claus in Japan," last
night before a well-filled auditorium.

lification. It was also announced that
every one was to receive apresent in
the shape of a box of candy from
"Santa" and the youngsters were there
in full force. . .
The piece was a digression from the
set Christmas entertainments, inasmuch

as visiting the Oriental children.
"Santa" appeared, on the scene in the
qustomary manner, followed by sev
eral midgets, and] was welcomed by a
gayly and attractively gowned chorus,
composed of pupils of the school, rang
ing from the wee : "cherry blossoms" of

PUBLICATION OFFICE THIRD AND MARKET STREETS. SAN FRANCISCO
FRIDAY DECEMBER 29, 1005
KANSAS AND STANDARD OIL.
EARLY in the History of the Standard Oil Company the genius
of Mr. Rockefeller saw the relation of transportation to the
competition which he desired to destroy. Out of this came
the oil pipe line system, an original and excellent device for^the
transportation of oil, wherever practicable. But it was not as uni
versally practicable as was necessary to secure the entire control of
the oil market, at which Mr. Rockefeller aimed. Then he resorted
to compulsion of the railroads to secure for himself secret rebates,
which made him the master and the tyrant of the situation. Compe
tition was destroyed, dead, and without a monument other than the
ruin of enterprises. Mr. Rockefeller became dictator of the price
of crude oil to the producer, and of refined in all its forms to the
consumer. -
.This is merely the restatement of an admitted fact. Jn reply
to the somewhat hysterical attacks upon Mr. Rockefeller, his attor
ney has admitted the rebates and defended them on the ground that
when they were forced upon the railroads and enjoyed by his client,
there was no law against that form of discrimination. That Is both
true and false. There was no statute law against an evil and dis
crimination that had not been noticed nor discussed. But the com
mon law of common carriers, enforceable- by the courts in the ab
sence of a statute, requires that they give equal service at equal
and reasonable rate to all alike. The attorney's defense was made
in vindication of the morality of Mr. Rockefeller's business methods,
but it was an inadequate defense.
However, with the vast oil business field to himself Mr. Rock
efeller did not lose sight of his early discovery that whoso controls
the transportation of a country controls also its production and
consumption. His profits on the monopoly of oil were enormous,
and he began their systematic investment in the stocks of the estab
lished railroads of the country. He has not been like Gould, a
builder of new systems or wrecker and rebuilder of old. but a steady
investor in existing lines, until no one except himself and his asso
ciates and the roads concerned knows the extent nor location of his
railroad holdings, nor what mileage he absolutely controls. There
are, in places, revelations of his power over transportation. His
hand is shown when attempts are made to molest his use of /that
power, and that is all the people know about it.
His invasion of the Kansas oil field was accomplished by his
usual methods, tempting the cupidity of some producers and rousing
the fear of others, until he secured a control that made rival re
fineries impossible. Then the State attempted the foolish, socialistic
experiment of a State oil refinery, under public ownership. Tbe
advocates of that cure-all went into spasms of delight over that State
refinery. It was to be the proof and demonstration that public own
ership of everything is the sole cure for Rockefellerism. But the
State. Supreme Court very properly, and on constitutional grounds,
invalidated the law which created the State refinery, and Kansas
drew on common sense for a remedy and found it. not in public
ownership of public utilities, but in State control of its creatures, the
corporations, *he artificial persons which are subject to law the same
as natural persons. This remedy was achieved in a maximum rate
and anti-discrimination law. which no railroad dare violate in Kan
sas. Under the influence of these statutes independent refineries
rose in that State, and Mr. Rockefeller, deprived of preferences arid
special privilege, found that there was one spot on the planet where i
he must do business like other people, subject to the same limita
tions and liable to the same law. ?:".'
It is no digression to say that the incident illustrates the su
periority of public control over public ownership, and is a direct and
distinct vindication of the views of President Roosevelt. When Mr.
Rockefeller found himself reduced to business equality with his com
petitors, by Kansas law. he did not have to experiment with means
of reprisal. In that he is no empiric. Long practice and genius have
made him an expert. He resorted at once to his control of trans
portation outside of Kansas and beyond the arm of State law. The
rate on Kansas oil received by railroads at the State line was fixed
at an impossible figure. His competitors could do business in
Kansas on equal terms with him, protected by the law, but he shut
them out of an outside market by his control of transportation out
side. The Kansas oil producers say that the law secures for them
in Kansas a square deal, but when they cross the State line they are
commercially dead. That means that Mr. Rockefeller, by control
of the railroads, has established "a dead line," and kills all oil busi
ness that tries to cross it. The rate on oil from Chanute to Kansas
City. Kansas, no miles, is 7 1-2 cents, and from Kansas City, Kansas,
to Kansas City. Missouri, one mile, it is 17 cents. Mr. Rockefeller
will not permit the invasion of his old province of Missouri by his
independent competitors of Kansas.
In the old days the Kansas line was a dead line, alternately held
by the border ruffians and the free State men. Mr. Rockefeller is
the new type of border ruffian and holds the dead line as securely
witti a freight schedule as his antetype held it with a Winchester.
This situation joins the issue. It is between the United States and
John D. Rockefeller. The Interstate Commerce Commission is the
agent of the United States. Its powers must be enlarged so as to
give the independent oil interests in Kansas, and everywhere, equal
ity of right with Mr. Rockefeller. The Kansas dead line only inten
sifies the issue. Socialist propositions are cards in Mr. Rockefeller's
hand.' Public control of natural and artificial persons alike, as par
ties to the social compact, is the solution, and a square deal for
all is the goal.
We are persuaded that Mr. Rockefeller will have to come down
and submit to the law and be penalized for the same acts that
penalize others. .
POLITICS IN THE SCHOOLS.
PRESIDENT WHEELER has hit an evil square in the vitals iii
attacking partisan selection of officers to administer the school
laws. School management and partisanship do not mix iwelK
It makes every teacher, janitor and charwoman subservient- to the
boss, whoever he is. They get employment by favor and hold it
by sycophancy, unless they are exceptionally strong. We know
what partisanship has done in the debasing of municipal govern
ment, and no one need feel secure that it excludes the schools from
its methods.
One remedy is to separate the election of school officers from
the general or regular municipal election, and hold it oosn s a separate
day. This abolishes trading votes and avoids the consequences of
straight ticket voting, which was the means of injuring the 'school?
of Oakland at the last electionby the defeat S* Dr. Myra Knox, one
of the most expert school officers in the State. \\
But a different daf for the school election does! not complete
the measures needed for safeguarding the schools against parti
san control. The selection by nomination must be considered. In
other States this is accomplished .by the appointment in the regular,
party conventions of joint school committees^ which meet and nomi
nate the school ticket. These committeemen are a sort of selected
electors, whose choice goes to the people for affirmation. Where
this has been tried it has worked satisfactorily. The only complaint
made is that the nominees of the joint committee are usually so fit
'and satisfactory that the people do not generally vote in large num
bers at the school election. This is not an insuperable objection to
the system, sinee -whenever an unfit person is nominated by the
committee a riYaJ candidate appears and the contest calls out the
voters.
By such a system of selection and election the people have a
chance to Manifest their interest in public education, which they are
denied when the school ticket is merged in the partisan ticket, to be,
used in trades and usually suffers in its personnel from the methods
by which- it is chosen.

THEY WERE IMPORTANT.
Once upon a time, Heloise, there was a
man who was very : important, as every
body, admitted; and he married a woman
who .was extremely Important, as every
body conceded; and the wedding was an
important function, as was freely men

I an important house on an important ave

looking at the house; and the man accu
mulated much money. ' which, as every
body knows, is the most important of all;
and it is *an important fact that he used
the important money to benefit nobody in
particularâ not even himself: and the
couple lent importance to a certain im

and after a while they secured a divorce
which was so supremely important that

were? you inquire. Well, 1 cannot say
definitely i as to that, but I greatly fear
that they are not. You see, on two im

much about them. They may be enjoy

Knowing Good From Evil
WALLACE RICE
SOMETIMES I wonder, when I lis
ten' to the conversations about re
cent revelations of dishonorable
conduct in high places, whether the
average man really knows what te
right and what is wrong.
You are told that there was noth
ing wrong In Chauncey M. Depew's
taking a retainer from an insurance
company as a lawyer, when it was
merely given him to secure his politi
cal influence in advancing or sup
pressing legislation at Albany, as the
company wished. As a lawyer he was
without power of the sort; if he pos
sessed it as a Senator of the United
States or as a politician it seems plain
to me that- he was selling his Senator
ship or declaring himself a venal pol
itician.
Personally, it appears to me that a
man who will take his seat in the
United States Senate and swear the
solemn oath he is compelled to take
as a Senator, knowing all the time
that his first duty is not to the United
States or the people thereof at all, but
to a certain railway company and set
of railway interests, has shown so
blunt a sense of his own honor that
anything may be expected of him ex
cept "good.

I am told that there is nothing
wrong in giving the members of one's
own family the preference in. appoint
ments to fat positions, since it 13 a
man's duty to care for his own. Or.
course, it te his duty â at his own ex
pense. In officials holding positions of
trust, whether under the Government
or not, it is nothing less than wicked
to provide for kinsfolk at the expense
of the public. Nepotism has always
been thought wrong by high-minded
men at all times and in all places.
Nor is it a sufficient answer to say
to those who urge that these things
are wrong. "You would do .the same
thing in his place." The high ideals
persist in this world, no matter what
sinful deeds are done.
The ten commandments do not
cease to be operative merely because
they are frenuently broken. All the
thieves in the world cannot make
stealing right. If the person who ob
jects to a low standard of honor and
integrity succumbs to temptation aml^v
himself sinks down toward death, the^
high standards nevertheless remain.
And of all the blunted notions of
what constitutes true probity and up
rightness the. conception that a sneer
at protestations of righteousness ft
even permissible seems to me the
most wicked. Devils can do no more.
COHEN'S LITTLE JOKE
Cohen, being an influential man. in his*
own* certain "select" society, naturally
could poll a great many votes for hi.*
favorite candidate. Assured, of corre
sponding individual benefit in exchange
for his influence. Cohen "boosts" tur
the "bosses' " man.
The man wins and Cohen gets the
desired position.
Cohen struts around in a grand uni
form at the railroad station, and in a
most, condescending manner gives the
people any information concerning train
times, etc., which they, may require.
A lady steps up to Cohen and polite
ly asks him "When the last train
leaves for Chicago."
Cohen looks at her and laughs.
She thinks he misunderstands ' and
ask him again.
Cohen simply howls with laughter
this time.
Lady becomes indignant, and after.
giving him a severe tongue lashing de
mands that he inform her "When the
last train leaves for Chicago."
Cohen looks. at her again and says
i with his richest Yiddish accent:
"Matama. I shoot only vish youâ you
shoot lift so long unt you cud see It." â

OF THE ATTACK
Man Who Was With Him
Tells of Admiral Train's
Trying Experience in China
ONLY TWO SHOTS" FIRED
David E. Gray. Who Arrived
on Coptic, Shares Danger
With American Officers
David R. Gray, who was with Rear
Admiral Train and his party when
they were attaok-'d l>y Chinese near
'Nganking. arrive 1 here Wednesday
evening on the lin< r Coptic. Gray shot
<ne of the attacking Chinese and oy
co doing saved the life of GovernmenÂ£
Pilot Langley. who himself had killed
a native a few minutes before to save
Captain F. F. Fletcher from being im
paled on a pitchfork in the hands of
an angry Celestial. These, saya Gray,
were the only shot* fired.
Gray was on board the Coptic yes
terday and told the story of the en
counter. He Is a nephew of J}. D.
Stubbs, general manager of the Occi
dental and Oriental Steamship Com
pany. He had been traveling in the
Far East for pleasure and was invited
to join the Train party on the trip on
which the Nganking affair occurred.
With the United States gunboats
(general Alava and Quiros, the party
traveled down the river from Hankow
.snd anchored about twenty miles above
Nganking. The admiral, Captain
Train, his son. who was in command
of the Qulroa; Captain F. F. Fletcher,
the admiral's chief of staff; J. Langley,
Government pilot; Gray, an orderly,
â¢ Â«nd a Chinee servant went ashore to
shoot pheasants.
Some spent shot from Captain
Train's gun struck a Chinese woman
who was hidden behind some bushes,
scaring her badly, but inflicting but
plight injuries. The officers went to
the woman's assistance. When they
found she had been so slightly hurt
.tlipy started for the gunboats, prom
ising to send the ship's doctor to look
hJ. the woman and to make just re
paration for the injuries inflicted.
"We had settled the matter." says i
Gray, "and it would have ended right
there but for the presence in the
neighborhood of a professional agi
tator. Before we reached the ships
we found ourselves surrounded by
about SCO angry natives, armed with
farming implements."
DISARM THE OFFICERS.
The natives took the shotguns from !
Admiral and Captain Train. The ad
miral resitted and was thrown to the
ground with some violence. The ad
miral was then allowed to proceed to
the ship, but Captain Train and the
orderly were held as hostages.
Then followed a parley, which lasted
six hours. In the meantime the sur
geon from the Quiros had examined
the woman and pronounced her In
juries plight. The villagers were as
sured that the ships would not go
away until the woman, who by this
time had developed a bad attack of
hysterics, had entirely recovered. All
right, said the villagers, but they
would hold Captain Train and the or
derly as security for the foreign dev
ils' word. No argument would Induce
them to consent to the liberation of
the ho-stages. so signals were made to
the gunboats and forty bluejackets
were sent ashore.
Before the force from the ships ar
rived the American officers made a
break for liberty. In his flight Cap
tain Fletcher tripped and fell. A Chi
nese was about to stick a pitchfork
Into the prone form, when Pilot Lang
ley whipped out a revolver and bored
a neat hole through the Celestial's
head. Fletcher regained his feet and
the retreat was resumed. Then Lang
ley fell and one of the villagers
charged at him. also with a pitchfork.
This time Gray's revolver spoke and
the second Chinaman bit the dust.
Then came the bluejackets.
Gray continued:
You don't know what a bully fine chap the
American bluejacket ie until you get into a
tiEht place among a lot of howling yellow
Arrtti and a bunch of weil-tralned, well-armed
and fesxlesy sailormen come trotting to the '
i-eecue. It was all over when they got there.
IVCIDEXT CLOSED.
Admiral Train did not wish to make any
report of the Incident to Washington by caÂ»
blÂ«. aa he was afraid the affair might eeem
more serious than It really was. We returned
to Xcarik-.njr and Admiral Train reported the
affair to the Chinese Governor, who went in
a gunboat to the scene. The Governor re
turned the following day with the two ehot
trant. He assured Admiral Train that he was
â¢\u25a0atitfled the shooting had been accidental and
that ample re&aratlon had be*n made for the
alight injury Inflicted. He apologized most
\ profoundly for the indignity to which the
officers had been submitted and assured Ad
miral Train that the offenders, who were un
der arrest, would bÂ« puninhed. This means
their heads would be cut oft.
* The admiral did not leave until the whole
bui.ceÂ»s b&d bten settled and the Incident
clewed. HÂ« was anxious to avoid comollca
tions with either Peking or Washineton. But
the etory reached Hongkong In greatly exag

NO STATEMENT
IS GIVEN OUT
Mitchell Changes His Mind
Upon Advice of Counsel
and Declines to Explain
COMMITTEE CONSULTS
Estimate of Indebtedness
to Be Formulated When
Clark Balances the Books
R. Brent Mitchell left his home on Pa
cific avenue yesterday for the first time
since his failure was made public, but
he did not visit the offices on New Mont
gomery 6treet, where he has been doing
business as a stockbroker. He called
upon several friends In the business por
tion of the city. His mission was sup
posed to be to raise funds. to settle with
his creditors. He did not furnish the
statement to the press that he volun
tered, Wednesday evening, to make. His
attorney, John A. Percy, advised him
against making any statement. Last
evening Mitchell said he would have mat
ters straightened out by next Tuesday.
The committee appointed by Mitchell's
creditors to Investigate his affairs held
two conferences yesterday. George Mas
tick of the committee said last evening
that Charles Clark, who was Mitchell's
bookkeeper, had been instructed to bal
arce the books and to estimate the values
of securities in which the creditors were
inteicsted on the basis of the official clos
ing prices at Kew York on Tuesday night
last. Considerable figuring will have to
by done, but Clark reported to the com
mJtioo that he would probably have the
books ready to submit for Inspection by
to-morrow morning. Probably no expert
will ba employed, the committee of cred
itors having come to the opinion that
they can dispense with an expert.
A meeting of the creditors will be held
next weok, when their committee may
have a report of the standing of Mitch
ell's affairs to submit and his methods
of doing business may be discussed in the
report.
Mitchell lnet evening declined to go into
details regarding his failure or his plan?.
He said his attorney, John A. Percy, had
refused to allow him to make public any
of his business affairs, and added he
would give out no statements for publi
cation till after next Tuesday afternoon.
â¢1 will say, hewever," said Mitchell
yesterday, "that I am now out of my
financial tangle. It got up bright and
early this morning and was closeted with
several of my financial friends. They are
going to come to my rescue and every
thing will be straightened out. I will not
be in a position to talk about a settle
ment till after the meeting of my cred\t
ors, which, I understand, will take place
next Tuesday afternoon.
"Illness was the sole cause of the un
fortunate failure. Had I been a well man
everything would have gone along
smoothly, and no failure could possibly
have happened. Every one has acted
very justly toward me in my hour of
trouble, and I am now so fixed to be In a
position to say that a speedy settlement
will be reached soon."
Mitchell refused to say on what basis
a settlement would be made, nor would
he divulge the names of the men of fin
ance who are comine to his rescue with
ready funds. He says they volunteered
their services, and as they are all capi
talists and men of standing they will
make good what they have promised
to do.
Mitchell has recovered entirely from his
nervous shock and appeared to be In a
cool state of mind yesterday. He was
around town nearly- all day, but managed
to keep his whereabouts quiet, * though
hundreds sought him at his offices and
elsewhere.
GRAND JUHY TO MEET TO-DAY.
Inquisitorial Body Will Probably In
vestigate the Failure of Mitchell.
Late last night District Attorney By
ington sent a call to the Grand Jury
to meet this afternoon at 3 o'clock in
the courtroom of Judge Lawlor in the
Hall of Justice. The request was not
accompanied by any explanation, but
it is said on good authority that the In
quisitorial body will be asked to look
fully Into the failure of R. Brent
Mitchell, the swamped stock broker.
The members of the jury gathered
in the City Hall last night, but were
without a quorum. They awaited in
structions from the District Attorney,
which were soon forthcoming. Noth
ing was done last night and soon after
Byington's message was received th/s
jurors disbanded to met again this
afternoon.
The cases of Jurors Hunter, Hartley
and Hickman of the Collins trial may
also be looked into.
The grand jurors/were In the dark
last night regarding what Bylngton
wished them to do, but they all knew
that some pressing business was at
hand when the District Attorney called
for a special meeting so quickly.

A. E. Boyd. president of the North
American Cable and Telegraph Company,
and vice president of the Alaska . Tele
graph and Telephone Company, Is in this
city from his headquarters at Nome,
where he has spent the last six years.
It is his first trip out during that period.
The North American Company recently
made application to lease or buy from
the United States Government all the
cable and land lines belonging to and op
erated by the United States In Alaska.
This embraces about 1600 miles and In
cludes the lines from Seattle to Nome.
The Alaska Telegraph Company already
has constructed and is the owner of 600
miles of lines in Alaska, in the vicinity
of Seward Peninsula. .
The Government lines have been oper
ated so far at a loss. If these are sold
or leased to the North American Com
pany, which is affiliated. with the Alaska
Telegraph Company,, the two will at once
commence the construction of a cable
line across the North Pacific.
It is the intention to build a cable from
Valdez to Dutch Harbor, thence to Kais
ka Island, and thence \to Vladivostok.
This covers a distance' of 4300 miles.
It is reported that the two companies
have unlimited financial backing for the
great work they propose to undertake.
The route over which the proposed new
cable is to run has been thoroughly in
vestigated, and Is feasible in every way.
Mr. Boyd has brought his family with
him from Nome. They enjoyed life in
that section of the country and spent
much of their time in driving over the
territory adjacent to Nome.

AN; OLD RAYING.
ShowlnK How Cause and Effect Are
'" Never Far Removed.
It Is an old saying "Where there's
honey there's . bees" â :not less troe Is
one which science has coined more re-
cently, "Where ..there's Dandruff there's
germs I 'â and â to push the Inference
still further we may truly say "Where
there's Dandruff cured Newbro's Herp-
icide has been bA work." '
The reason of Herpiclde's Isolation as
a genuine cure for Dandruff lies in the
fact that it attacks and destroys the
root of the whole trouble â a parasitic
germ which feeds upon the material
which nourishes the hair follicle.
Other so-called remedies are not di-
rected at this true cause of the disease.
Accept no substitute, there is none.

The Oceanic Steamship Company's
liner Mariposa. Ciiprain Robert T. Law
less, sailed yesterday for Tahitit S.ie
carried considerable cargro and a fair
number of passengers. Most of the
people who go from here to Tahiti are
travelers for pleasure, and at this sea
eon of the year social festivities ashore
ere too attractive for ocean Journey
ins to be very popular. For this rea
ron the Mariposa carried fewer pas
rensers than usunl, although at Tahiti
V is always summer and the voyage to
t.nd from the South Sea paradise is
usually pleasant.
Most of the llariposa's passengers
ere well known in local society.
Among those now journeying to the
pretty port of Papeete are:
MrÂ» V.illUm H. Avery. David Bush. Dr. A,
II Coe M'.ss Josephine Cummlncs. J. H.

The officers of the liner Coptic have discov
ered why the Chinese launtirynien at Hong

\u25a0 The Blunts Re^f lightship sailed yesterday
morning fcr her station on the Mendocino
coa*t from which the was blown a few days
rcn when the shank of her mushroom anchor
parted and the vessel was turned adrift in a
norm. With a new anchor, the second in a
Jew weeks, she left port early yesterday morn
ing. She was sighted j-assinj: Point Reyes at
F-.30 Â©"clock yesterday afternoon. A terrific
norther was raging. The wind was blowing
at the rate cf seventy-two miles an hour, but
in spite of the LeaiJ blast opposing her prog
ress the lightship was making headway. Cap
tain Ouinton s!cna!ed Point Reyes that all
v.as well with tbe lightship and that she would
be able- to nicke her way to Blunts Reef in
Maroonrd on Mile Hook.
The keei>er en the new Mile Rock lighthouse
ttook liarge Of his station yesterday and be
pan housekeeping in the narrow limits of his
rock based tower. Three officials from the
lighthouse board visited the place yesterday to
sec the caretaker properly installed. The three
â¢vteitors are ttill there. By the time they -were
reac' l- tj return to the mainland th* freshen
ing "breeze had so stirred up the sea that it
* -was impossible for the launch which had taken
\u2666 them out to approach the rock. Tbe longer
they waited the higher rolled the waves and
finally the n:en in the HghthouaÂ« signaled the
launch to go home and return for them to

BUSINESS WAYS
OF CORPORATION
George W. Keynolds Tells
About the Eecovery of
Vouchers and Accounts
FOUND IN A STABLE
Testifies That Some Stock
of Spring Valley Company
Earned Dividends \u25a0 at Par
The examination, of George W. Rey
nolds in the case oi the Spring Valley
Water Company vs. the City and County
of San Francisco was continued yester
day in the office of the company, M. B.
Kellogg appearing for the company and
John S. Partridge for the city.
Mr. T Reynolds testified that the testi
mony of Expert Wenzelburger, that
Reynolds was responsible for the missing
cash .books, was a mistakeâ that he had
never had those books in his possession
and. was not responsible for their loss.
The witness also testified that a number
of other books, which the company has
always claimed were lost, have been found
in a storeroom at 'the Bryant-street sta
bles. "He also found there the missing
vouchers covering the years 1860 to 18S6,
which the company's witnesses testified
were not in existence.
The witness testified that in ISGS the
company sold 20,000 shares of its stock for
$58 a share, and he admitted, on cross
examination, that these shares had paid
dividends ever since on the par value, or
$100 a share. He; stated that in his opin
ion legal expenses and 25 per cent of the
entire interest paid since the adoption of
the new constitution should be charged
to construction ' account and become a
part of the permanent investment of the
company.
On the cross-examination, however, he
admitted that these charges were paid
out of the water rates, and he also said
that he had no information as to the true
amount of Interest during construction,
because the company changed its system
of bookkeeping so" often, and that he
adopted 23 per cent as a mere estimate.
The witness explained the loan in March
of this year to the Bank of California by
saying that that institution had sold the
company's bonds, and that the money
was on hand and not Immediately used.
He admitted that the company borrowed
money from the bank at 4 per cent on
the bonds and loaned it back to the bank
at V& per cent, and also that some of the
money borrowed from - the bank was
loaned to the telephone company at 3
per cent and that the difference, namely,
IV6 per, cent on the loan to the Bank of
California and 1 per cent on the loan to
the telephone company, was charged to
profit and loss, and paid out of the water
rates.
The cross-examination of Mr. Reynolds
came to an end yesterday. The taking of
testimony, which has lasted seventeen
months, will be finished next week.

MAKES COWARDLY ASSAULT
ON MAN FROM SANTA CRUZ
Joseph K. Roberta Obtains a 'Warrant
for Homer Johnson** Arrest for
Battery.
Joseph E, Roberts, a poultry raiser
from Santa Cruz, obtained a warrant
yesterday afternoon for the arrest of'
Homer Johnson, a telegraph operator
from San Jose. Roberts' face was cov
ered with bandages and his eyes were
blackened.
He said he came here at the invita
tion, of the California Promotion Com
mittee and engaged rooms at 951 Mis
sion street. His wife paid a visit to
some' friends in San Jose and came on
here on Wednesday. That night while
Roberts was leaving; the house John
son, he says, touched him on the shoul
der, saying,. "Hello, Roberts; how are
you?" As Roberts turned round he was
struck a violent blow on the face with
a pair of , brass knuckles. The blow
knocked him down and rendered . him
almost unconscious. His face was torn
and cut from the blow and he had to
send for. a' physician to stitch and dress
the wounds. '
Roberts says that Johnson had evi
dently trailed Mrs. Roberts t from San
Jose to find out where they were living
and lay in wait for him. He cannot ac
count for the cowardly assault. He had
some trouble with Johnson's mother at
one time about $7, but he thought that
was all forgotten. .

CUTS THROAT
WITH A RAZOR
I>aiil Wells Prefers Death
to the Chance of Spend
ing Term in 'San Quentin
BODY IS AT MOBGTJE
Why He Chose to Steal Is a
Mystery, as He Had Funds
on Deposit in Two Banks
Paul "Wells, rather than face the or
deal of a trial, ended his life yester
day morning by cutting hia throat
with a razor In his room at 623
Kearny atreet. He was lying on the
floor with the razor clutched In bis right
hand. The body waa removed to the
Morgue by Deputy Coroner Brown.
Wells was arrested on December 20
by Policeman Curtln of the Chinatown
squad on complaint of Lou Toy, one pf
the proprietors of a Chinese bazaar at
Washington and Dupont streets. Lou
Toy told Curtln that about three week*
previously Wells had entered thÂ« store
and had stolen about SlOO worth of
Jewelry. Wells denied that he was the
man, but the Chinese was positive In
his identification and Wells was
booked at the City Prison on a charge
of grand larceny.
The case was assigned to Police
Judge Conlan's court and tha prelim
inary examination was to have been
held yesterday. Wells was admitted to
bail on December 22 In $500 cash.
When the case was called yesterday
the defendant failed to appear and At
torney Rose, who represented him,
was in a state of great excitement,
as the Judge threatened to forfeit the
bail and Issue a bench warrant for
Wells' arrest. Rose asked for a con
tinuance and the Judge gave him an
hour to produce the defendant. Be
fore the hour expired Rose informed
the Judge that Wells*, dead- body was
on the way to the Morgue. The case
was continued till this morning, when
it will be stricken from the calendar.
Wells was 38 years of age and gave
Ms occupation as a farmer. From
notes In a memorandum book found
among his papers he was born In
Friendly, W. Va. He went home in the
summer of 1899 and came to this city
in the spring of 1900, leaving for
home the following year and return
ing to this city In March, 1902. He
had been living at 523 Kearny street
for about two years. A receipt for a
registered letter dated December 18.
addressed to Miss Blanche H. Wells,
Friendly, W. Va., was found, besides
a number of letters from Joseph Seep*
Oil Â» City. Pa., addressed to Wells In
different parts of the State, sending
checks for shares. There were also
two bank books, one with the First
National Bank of Los Angeles, show
ing a deposit of $954, and the other
with the San Francisco Savings Union,
'showing an amount to his' credit of
$864. He had drawn $550 on Decem
ber 22 for his bail and $50 attorney's
fees. The papers have been turned
over to the Public Administrator. t
It. is considered strange that a man
having so much money at his com
mand should become a petty thief.
The rash act was evidently committed
In a fit of despondency over his dis
grace, whether he was guilty or in
nocent of the crime.

the Kindly Tlioughtf illness
of the Chief Executive
BBob Fitzsimmons received a kindly,
-ympathelic letter from President Theo
dore Roosevelt yesterday, which he
treasures above all his worldly posses
sions.
The President, in his manly and char
acteristic style, wrote Fitz words of sym
pathy ard of encouragement when he
learned of the laiter'B defeat at the hands
of Jack O'Brien, He found umo from his
manifold duties to send a cheering word
to a man in whom he found many quali
tlÂ« which appeal to him. He saw the
tragedy in tiie life of the fighter who had
asked odds of no man in hundreds of
Jiattles. but had ever been ready to pit his
?.thlc.tio skill and his strength against all
manner of opponents. The tima had ar
rived when nature declined to answer
further demands, and a world-famous
fighter was compelled to strike his colors
jo a younger opponent.
Fitzsimmons wired an appreciative an
stfer to America's foremost citizen and
sportsman. He thanked him for his
kindly thoughtfulness and wished Mm the
eemplimejits of the season. His answer
rr.aj- reem a formal acknowledgment to
The President, but mere words cannot ex
press the depth of his feeling at this time,
wiicn he i* suffering both mentally and
physically. The President's letter comes
as a harbinger of better days to come.

Are Xot Heard From
NEW YORK, Dec. 28.â A concerted
movement toward reforming the game of
football in the colleges and universities
of America was begun here to-day, when
representatives of sixty-eight Institutions
i of learning agreed to act together in se
| curing ihe adoption of rules and an en
forcement of them that are expected to
materially lessen the danger to players,
do away with mass formation and secure
t permanent officials for intercollegiate con
j testa. The conference has effected a per
j manent organization and appointed a
i rules committee of seven, which will com
| munlcate with the representatives of
I Yale, Princeton, Harvard, Pennsylvania,
Cornell, Annapolis and Chicago Univer
sity constituting the existing committee
on rules asking for an amalgamation
! with that body. None of the foregoing
universities was represented at to-day's
conference.
The committee or. rules named by the
conference follows: E. J. Hull, Dart
mouth; Lieutenant Daly. West Point; J.
A. Babbitt, Haverford College; Dr. H. D.
Williams, University of Minnesota; C. W.
Savage, Oberlin College; James T. Lees.
University of Nebiaska, and F. H. Cur
tis, University of TVxas. ,
The committee will go to Philadelphia
to-morrow to present its credentials to j
the existing football rules committee. '
The following permanent officers were
elected: President, Captain Palmer E.
Pierce. West Point;, vice president. Dean
"W. D. Wild, Williams College; secretary".
Louis Bevier Jr., Rutgers College.
The appointment of a ruies committee
to act with the existing football commit
tee was the result of the stand taken by
West Point in favor of such action as the
most rational course for the conference
i.j pursue. The instructions to the new
rules committee were those recommended
by West Point. Captain Pierce, repre
senting the Military Academy, declared
the academy authorities did not want all
the roughness taken from the game. Some
knocks and bruises were necessary to the \u25a0
sport, he said. He believed the pres- :
ent rules, slightly modified and enforced, ,
would bring about the desired change in
the game. Among the many resolutions
introduced the following was adopted:
\Vhertaa, The same of football as practiced

an effort to remove this objectionable phase

the vital questions of eligibility of students

the condnct of all sucb matters.
Resolved, That the action taken at this con

colleges actually engaged In the frame with
the request that the same be referred and shall
be binding en any institutions only upon rati

FAVORS PRESENT GAME.
President Sehannan of Cornell Enters
Strong Plea for FootbalL
SYRACUSE, N. V., Dec. 28.â President
Jacob Gould Bchurman of Cornell Uni
versity, in an address before the as
sociated academic principals of the State
of Xew York to-night, placed himself on
record as a stanch friend of football,
declaring that the recent criticism of the
game "if not hysterical and frenzied, is
at lea>t one-sided and unfair."
President Schurmaft urged that the
game should not be abolished. Modify it,
he suggested, co as to relieve the extra
hazards, but to abolish it, he asserted,
would be to do away with the most popu
lar sport of the youth of the country and
of the American people themselves. Presi
dent Schurman's theme was "National
Greatness." and he devoted considerable
attention to the physical basis of man
hood. In the physical training of the
youth. Dr. Schurman declared, outdoor
sports take- the place in this country of
the military service required in Germany.
"And speaking for the colleges and unlvcrsl
tleÂ«," he eaid, "I am sure they have teen an
effective antidote to effeminate weakness to
low vice and to foolish disorder and rowdyiscu
However strange it may sound to critics, it Is
nevertheless true that athletics have made it
pculble to govern (because athletics have de
veloped an esprit de corps) hundred*, yea, thou
sands, of students in a single university year
after year without the he;p of Jury, court cr
policeman.
"Am I, then, an advocate of football? What
I have said I have no desire to alter. Base
ball and football are. thu oest outdoor sports
we have for the American youth, and football
is the most appropriate, not only among the
youth, but among the American people them
selves. It iÂ« a rough game, but- taking ac
count of the large number of people who play
It â comparing them, for example, with the
more luxurious motorist â the number of serious
accidents and of fatalities ts small. The game
is so stirring; it challenges so potently the
playing impulse of young Americans; it appeals
to the popular love of vigorous competition; it
hae in It many elements of military discipline
end moral training; tt affords such a volumin
ous vent for huge masses or superfluous feeling
and energy In players and spectators alike,
which would otherwise seek and find an outlet
in more dubious channels.
"The game is rough, but roughness is no
bad ordeal, and even the Scriptures enjoin us
to 'endure hardness.' The game is attended
with accidents, so is every game, sd, every form
of hi-man activity and every form of idleness."

FRED E. MULHOLLAND
The management of the New Califor
nln Jockey Club announced yesterday
that racing: would terminate at Intfle
sldf to-morrovr. Oakland track will be
reopened to the public ou Monday
next, where the' season trill be fin
ished. Quite apparently the local
conrne ha* lost Its popularity. Horse
men complained ' about the cuppy con-.
dittoit of the track, the transportation
facilities were inadequate and nobody
Â»eemcd pleased. When the announce
ment of the change was made in the
betting rtngf by Bob McGlbben it was
greeted with great cheering by the
crowd. All of the owners expressed
satisfaction at the shift.
A two-year-old dots not always come
back when asked to repeat two days in
succession, especially over a muddy track,
but Ramus is an exception.
The sturdy Governor Foraker colt, from
the stable of- Stevens & Son, lost a nose
decision to Dr. Gardner on Wednesday,
and In the last race at Ingleside yester
day disposed of a fair field at a mile.
He had first call in the ring, and under
vigorous riding . from Trubel won some
what easily from Governor Davis, a 50
to 1 shot, and Busy Bee, another out
sider.
FOUR CHOICES IS FROXT.
Despite the disadvantages of a muddy
course over which to run public choices
were first on four occasions. There was
an average crowd present and the books
were kept busy.
Lady Toddington, from the stable of
Walter Jennings, proved a mud runner
for fair In the five-furlong scramble that
opened the racing. The filly, with Knapp
on her back, closed a 9 to 20 chance, and
splashed home first at leisure. Miss Spo
kane, a 20 to 1 shot, downed Santa Ray
for the place.
Radtke got beaten on Bountiful, an
odds-on favorite. In the next, a six and a
half furlong st.ling run. ,He picked the
rail route, where the going was deepest,
and Distributor, a 16 to 1 shot, ridden by
Leroy Williams, beat the first choice out
handily. Nearly a dozen lengths back
Joe Kelly took the show with Duelist.
BUCOLIC NEARLY LOSES.
Dr. Rowell's three-year-old, Jd"y Order,
came within an ace of defeating: Bucolic,
the 6 to 5 choice for the third, a three
quarter mile run. Al Minder piloted the
latter, and in a driving finish earned a
neck decision. Soundly went out at the
start as if fired from - a catapult, but be
fore reaching the - stretch, exploded with
the report of a' Russian bomb factory.
While not partial to sticky going Gos
siper can hot-foot it and no mistake in
slop. The filly looked the only one of the
eight starters in the first mile selling fix
ture afflicted with early speed, and then,
too. had Radtke in the saddle. Played
down to 16 to 5 favoritism from 4, the
chestnut filly led from start to finish.
Beaten less than a length Ed Sheridan,
with more vigorous handling, could un
doubtedly have won. Forerunner just
lasted long enough to take the show from
Esherin.
Apprentice Downing graduated from the
maiden class by capturing tKe split of the
mile selling event with Hilee. The dark
bay gelding always evinced a fondness
(or Juicy footing and he scored cleverly
from Lerida and Frank Woods, after
leading most of the way. Dusty Miller,
the favorite, loitered along the road.

he turned over to.J. J. Appeal as trustee
securities on which WI.COo was realized,

KOREA QUIETLY
ACCEPTS TREATY
Keport That the Pact Was
Forced Upon the Hermit
Kingdom Proves Untrue
BUT SMALL OPPOSITION
Letter From Burnham White
Stevens, Adviser to Seoul
Government, Gives Facts
WASHINGTON, Dec. 23.â 1n a private
letter, to a friend in this city, Burnham
White Stevens, diplomatic adviser to the
Korean Government, comments as fol
lows upon j recent reports that the treaty
establishing a Japanese protectorate over
Korea was extorted by force: : .
In Seoul vt<f learn that curiously distorted
accounts of the occurrences of the night of
November 17 have been telegraphed to America
and Europe. One in particular to the Berlin
Lokal . Anzeiger is especially mendacious. It
speaks of the "tragedy in Seoul," of which
reports. have come from "well informed quar
ters," , and asserts that Marquis Ito, together
with Minister Hayashi and General Hasegawa.
accompanied by a large contingent of Japanese
troops, forced the Emperor to sign . the new
treaty, which they had already prepared and
brought with them; that the Korean Ministers
fled from the palace In order not to affix the
seal of state to a document which robbed their
country of Independence; that Japanese/soldiers
were cent after them and that they were forci
bly brought back and ordered to affix their
seals. The account closes with the statement

Marquis Ito came from Toklo with an auto
graph letter to the Emperor of Korea from the
Kmperor of Japan. . This letter Inclosed a
hope for a closer union between the two coun
tries. Its tone and purport were well calcu
lated to demonstrate Japan's friendly Inten
tions and soothe Korean susceptibilities. The
choice of an envoy, moreover, was decidedly
\u25a0 fes^ny, as Marquis Ito Is especially persona
grata to the Emperor of .Korea. He came
here on a somewhat similar "mission at the
beginning of the war, and several times since
to my personal knowledge has been urgently
requested by the Emperor to .repeat the visit.
On this occasion he presented the autograph
letter at a formal audience, and several days
later had a prlvate'^idlence of over four hours*
duration. He ; explained the situation and
Japan's wishes fully to the Emperor, and the
latter agreed In princlcle to the propositions
which the Marquis stated would be formally
submitted later on by the "Japanese Minister.
The Emperor stated that the decision regard
ing the details of the new arrangement would
be left to his Cabinet, and gave orders that
the latter should consult with the Japanese
Minister.
Conferences then ensued between the Min
ister and the Cabinet, the last one. by mutual
agreement and In accordance with the Em
peror's order, taking place at the palace. Ul
timately Marquis Ito was asked to attend, and
he came accompanied by General Hasegawa.
The : discussion then proceeded for several
hours; amendments were proposed by the Ko
rean Cabinet and accepted, and finally the
amended form was agreed to by a majority of
six out of eight members of the Cabinet.
Thereupon the treaty was signed and sealed
by the Minister of Foreign Affairs in con
formity with the direct order of the Emperor.
During all these proceedings there was no
show of force and no unseemly exhibition of
any kind whatever.
Of course, there was opposition in Korea to
the treaty: It would be foolish to deny that
fact. But there Is no such thing as popular
opposition In the sense In which we understand
the word in America, \
MIKADO OPENS TIIE DIET.
Announces Restoration of Friendly'
Relations r With Russln.
. TOKIO, Dec. 28.â The Emperor, in
opening the Diet to-day, made a speech
from the throne expressing his appre
ciation of the . loyalty of the nation
and of the -devotion of all the public
Bervices, which, he said, had enabled
the bringing of the war with Russia
to a glorious -conclusion. His Ma
jesty announced- that friendly rela
tions with Russia had been restored
and that the attitude of the treaty
powers toward Japan was becoming in
creasingly, amiable. He alluded with
satisfaction to the Anglo- Japanese al
liance and to the necessity which com
pelled Japan to give her guidance to
Korea.
The House of Representatives, after
adopting a loyal address to the Em
peror, adjourned to January 20.

HAZED CADET
ON THE STAND
J. P. Kimbrough Tells How
He Was Forced to Eemain
on His Head at Annapolis
COURT-MAETIAL - BEGINS
Trenmor Coffin of Nevada
Will Endeavor to Save
Himself From Expulsion
ANNAPOLIS, Md., rfeo. 25.-Court
martlal proceedings against Midshipman
Trenmor Coffin Jr. of Nevada^ a mem
ber of the third class, on the charge of
hazing Midshipman J. . P. Kimbrough of
the fourth class, began at the naval
academy to-day. The charge is supported
by the specification that on December 12
last the accused caused Kimbrough to
stand on his head until he became uncon
scious.
The president of the court is Captain
Corwin P. Rees. Lieutenant Commander
"William K. Harrison ia judge advocate
and TV S. Theall of Washington is coun
sel for the accused.
Midshipman M. W. Hewlett of the third
class was the first witness. The witness
testified that ' he had seen Kimbrough
standing on his head.
Midshipman Kimbrough was the next
witness and it developed that he was
unable to Identify Coffin as the man who
had hazed him. The rule, it appears, is
that no lower classman must look at an
upper classman under Buch circumstances
and this was observed in the "present case.
Kimbrough could not say that Coffin had
hazed him. He told, however, how he
had been hazed by being compelled to
stand on his head until he gave out en
tirely. Then the midshipman who was
doing the hazing threw water over him
and compelled him to go on again.
Lieutenant Commander Charles B. Mc-
Vey Jr. was the last witness during the
morning's session. He is attached to the
department of discipline at the academy.
The court ruled that the evidence of the
confession which CoflHn made to McVey
was admissible, inasmuch as the confes
sion was entirely voluntary. The officer
said that Coffin also asked to be allowed
to resign. '\u25a0â¢ -â¢'\u25a0'-
Surgeon J. C. Byrnes, the ranking med
ical officer of the academy, stated that,
he was called to see kimbrough on the
night mentioned and found him in a state
of physical collapse. On cross-examina
tion Dr. Byrnes said positively that Klm
brough's unconsciousness was real and
that he might have died had he not re
ceived prompt attention.
The defense offered only midshipmen
as witnesses,, but will continue the pre
sentation of its case to-morrow. The wit
nesses all testified that they did not con
sider Kimbrough's reputation for truth
telling the best, but admitted they had
only heard reflections upon his truthful
ness since the incident which forms the
basis of the trial and they also admitted
that the midshipmen had considerable
feeling against him.

Â» They were r<ai<j also on the afsuinwicn that
the hieh rate may hold or even bt exceeded
."on t*ie reiiiair.ine day of the week. The ar
â¢ Eument was heard among speculative opera
â¢â¢ tors that th!* year the rate of interest was
well worth paying for the day or two until
UÂ»e end of the year on the .prospect that 'â¢
â¢ * prices would likely advance in larger propor
tion than the daily amount of interest reDre-
FPntcd-at this rate. It was asserted with eaLger
s Â»-mhuÂ»iaf?ni algo that these few remaJnlnn days
.*>f Fttineent money would offer the only op
â¢ tor eecurinÃ stocks at present level
Â«>f prices. Such was the spirit that dominated
an extraordinary stock market, which i3-nored
eoÃdUons that have been the sienal for a
l-anicky unloading of securities in the paw
uvperience of the Stock Exchange. Tliei-e was
. something of a to unload stocks dur
ir\g the early transactions In the market owing
â¢ to an apprehension that It would be found
W Impossible to borrow money on any terms.
~ l*iÂ»jbably the IlQuidation thus effected caused
â¢ some relief in the money tension. The extra
â¢ ordinary interest rates also had their effect
-.In brtneing offerings into the market from
mazsy unexpected sources, some of them lnftij:
rlfloant in thfmw.oves, including email orivate
<jppos!t accounts, but making up a large aic
eTeeate. Pome batiklnc funds were made
: tevailablc from outside wriurces. The strictly
â¢ local character of the stringency is a Temark
â¢: Â«Tble feature of the ei4i=ode. Money on call
et nearby cities --"tlnues to rule at not ovÂ«r
. 6 r>er cent. Wfcile a good demand exists for

;, * cn # t of contemplated measures of relief for

" Treasury, but the arrival of that official at
. <t"fcicaÂ«ro confirm*- d the assertion that such
measures of relief would be made dew-ndent
â¢upon the findlne of evidence of the need out
.: side of the speculative centers. It was broadly
â¢ flitlmated. however, that the Treasury Depart
ment would adopt a tolerant attitude toward
â¢ the reÂ»erve requirement of the basks during
â¢ the existence ' " any crisis In the history of
â¢ the money market, and it was the General
\u25a0 suiooÃitlon that the banks were availing.
ââ¢ themselves of this imo"'- ' r>Â»rmlsaion to en
â¢ t-ro-sfii liberally upon their reserves. i"here w.is
an urgent <JÂ«mfend for time loans for the
shorter oeriods ar well as for call loans and
the oommiwlons demanded to eecure slxtv and
Tilnetj- day funds made the rate equivalent to
U per cent. This condition in the time loan
market cpens a serlouÃ question as to the jus
tification for overweening confidence <Â« the
speculative circles of an Immediate relaxation
in the money strlnrency after, the first of
M ie year. ThÂ« weekly statement of the Bank
of England disclosed an almost unprecedent
edly weak condition cf that institution for
the period, and the weekly return of the Bank
of France was a poor one. There were conttant
rumor* here of the formation of a bankers'
pooly to provide a fund for the money market
as was cone in the crisis of 1902. It was
Alleged also that the banks had concerted in
â¢in agreement to keep the rate of standinr
loans at a .fixed figure until next week. These
rumorÃ were of effect on sentiment, but could
not \u25a0be confirmed. Tfce late relapse in the
money rate of CO per cent was of no elsnlfl
canco, roost demands having been satisfied
before that rate wÂ« touched, but the edccu
lative confidence was maintained and the mar
ket clomd active and strong. Anaconda Min
ing ran a sensational feature and ether cod
per and smelting stocks were conspicuous, but
such stocks &s Union Paciflc and New York
Central kept up the reoutatlon of the stand

A'cw York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK, Dec. 28.â Cotton was weak
again this morning. Oncemore the bull lead
ers put in support, and; aided by scattered
short covering, checked the selling and brought
about a rally in the afternoon.
The close was firm In tone. Again there was
only a limited demand for spot cotton in the
Southern markets. Rallies can be brought
brought about from time to time and liquida
tion may be postponed. .There has been large
liquidation of long cotton In January and Feb
ruary on contracts hero this morning.
Late cables report that heavy liquidation oc
curred In January and February deliveries at
Liverpool all day, but there was an Increased
trade demand from both Manchester and Lan
caster at the decline, and mis rallied the. mar
ket there at the close.
To-moirow is noiite day tn January and there
may be some more liquidation of this month.

CHICAGO, Dec. 28.â Sentiment In the wheat
pit was bearish for â¢ the entire ' day. '', Many of
the big holders were discouraged by-thd days
statistics and cold heavily- during the fearller
part of the day. This selling was later aug
mented by the free offerings from commission
houses and local traders. >, A number of bulls
gave active I support to the" market late In the
day and materially checked the decline. "\u25a0- At the
opening the market was depressed by reports of
a decline at Liverpool and by the large Increas â¢
in Btock at Minneapolis. Later there . came
messages from the Southwest reporting the crop
outlook as excellent. A trade rpaper 'in- Cincin
nati declared that conditions surrounding, win
ter wheat have rarely If. ever been equaled at
this season of the year. -Primary receipts con
tinued large. ". The May option opened >4Â©%c
to %<imc lower at 88%@86%c to 66% c and sold
off to 80% c. A more lively demand ensued late
in the day, active bidding being made by short*.
This, with the demands fronv- the bull eltle..
caused a rally In May to 87% c, where it closed
14 c off. -
A bulge of 2Â»4c per bushel in the price of old
December corn followed moderate covering -by
shorts in that delivery. The volume of trading,
however, was not large. "Weakness of wheat,
had some effect on the May option, that-deliv

The feature .of trading in oats was an ad

So declarf-d Principal George Al
M.rrill of the Lick and Wilmerding
Bcboola in his paper on "Student Ac
tivities." read before the convention of
tlie Teacher*' AÂ«Â«3ciation at Berkeley
â¢yesterday. In hit? argument he an
iifitin'fd himself as opposed to the plan
of Heveral -college presidents and many
'.university men who would eliminate
football from the preparatory schools.
He stated that he hol\f\-od the pres
ent frame could, and should, be re
" formed and that possibly a somewhat
different system should be used at the
university and the high school, but he
>\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0<\u25a0. in plain terms) his' belief that
football was a good thing: for the boy
â¢who is studying in the high school. .He
advocated the abolishing of champion
ships.
WHACKS Till: FItATERXITV.
Principal Merrill took a whack at
the high school fraternity as it exists
to-day. He presented two resolutions,
one stating: that it is unprofessional
for a high school teacher to accept
I membership In a high school frater
nity, and th*Â» other stating that "high
school fraternities should not be dom
iciled within the school building's or
accorded recognition of any sort."
He also declared that student ac
tivities were overdone and took occa
sion to discredit the work of the Ama
teur Athletic League, which controls
high school athletics. He said:
Mu<lrnt activities ar* inclined to encroach
on the established work of the school. They
are overdone, r>nttl<u]arly football. Th*re is
Â£.i:\. v.Uy in providing suitable facilities for
, them In and around the school buildings.
\u25a0'\u25a0â¢!Â»â¢ is difficulty in raising funds among the
â¢tudentH and more difficulty in spending them
vinely â and. I am sorry 10 say, In s&feiruarding
them aculnfft dishonesty. School rivalry de
â¢o*ndfc to 111 fueling, disorderly conduct, act*
of vatnluliKm. etc. Professionalism creeps In.
I'arents .scmoilmt-s get fooltrhly ambitious; llk-
Ine to nee their children ehlne as football he
roe*, particularly captains and as president* of
fraternities, etc., thry become really obnoxious
promoters of Mrenuout sports for boys and
elaborate social functions for girls. Occasion
ally the misguided principal of a school seeks
to advertise hlÂ» institution through Us athletic
or debatlnc team.
A. A. 1- IS UIVWIELDV.
The A. A. J* aÂ» now onranlzed Is not only
an unwieldy working body, but It if aim indi
rectly â though only |>artlyâ reeponslble for the
fact that athletics are overdone In pome re

"I was troubled with a serers t cÂ»lp

Its equivalent.- UndÂ«r the present plan a
â¢chool that meet* defeatiln the early gumes of

ticular snort ceases for the season In that

ing on through a season unduly prolonged. If
the sport is carried on for health and recrea
tion, then there should be some arrangement
by which all the schools can have a uniform
season of reasonable length.
Some of the delegates In the A. A. I*, are
students and come are teachers. Formerly all
or nearly all were students, but now the
teacher* arÂ« nearly or quit* In thÂ» majority.
PYom my . observation* I am of the- opinion
"7
that this is not a rood phiÃ. The counsel of
older heads is desirable, but so Is student con
trol. There are times and circumstance*, also,
when this association of teachers and etudents
on a common voting . basis is uncomfortable
and even humiliating foe* the latter. As a
remedy I would suggest two separate govern
ing bodies, one composed entirely of teachers
an<l the Â©iher entirely of students, with a dl
vlÂ»Ion of duties. The teachrrs could establish
policies, arrange schedules of games to prevent
ronfljrt with school programmes, and. exercise
functions of general supervision â perhaps main
ly legislative. To the students could be left
matters of protests, qualifications of athletes,
the Immediate conduct of games, etc.
Whether or not my suggestions- are good
on?*, it Is certain that we as high school
teachers are seeking a bettermtnt of athletic
conditions all along the line, and we shall br
pleased to hear what these gentlemen of the
A. A. L. and others present have to say that
will contribute to that end.
SEVEN THOUSAND PIIESEXT.
Yrstorday's session of the Teachers'
Association was the largest since the
opening day. It is estimated that fully
7<X)O men and women interested in educa
tional work were present. Nearly all of
these were teachers. Business sessions
and discussjons along educational lines
occupied the entire morning. In- the
afternoon great > excursions were run to
Stanford University and to points of in
terest about the bay. Discussions .were
also held during the entire afternoon. ,
One of the most Interesting discussions
of the day took place at. the meeting of
the State Library Association during the
morning. Frank F. Bunker of the. State
Normal School took the stand in discuss- t
Ing tlu* question, "Should the State Text
books be Supplemented, and If so, to "\Vhat
Extent?" that the teachers should. not
confine themselves to the- narrow limits
of the textbooks offered in the report of
the State . Textbook Committee. He
urged the building up of the libraries so
that more supplementary work could be
done by teachers and pupils. Robert Fur
long, secretary -of the committee ' that
made tho report, vigorously defended the
action taken and declared that the ( Cali
fornia textbooks need no supplementing.
Opinion sppmed to 'favor the' stand of
Bunker.
During the same, session, Frank ,B.
Cooper, Superintendent of - the, Seattle
schools, pointed out the need for a course
of Instruction in library methods in the
normal schools and universities. He said
that, as in California, where each district
has an appropriation for a library, the
teachers often made poor and useless se
lections of books through lack of knowl
edge.
At the meeting of the Department of
School Boards and Trustees papers were
read by C. H. Rowell of Fresno, S. C.
Evans of Riverside, J. VW. Atherton of
San Rafael; J. O'Connor) principal of the
Mission High School, San Francisco, and
â¢ Frank B. Cooper of Washington. Papers
were also read before the County Board
Organization.

FATS TRAINS
FOR THE MAIL
Special Postal Cars to Be
Operated Between Omaha
. and San Francisco Soon
EAST ", BROUGHT- CLOSER
Superintendent Stephens
Succeeds in' Inducing the
Railway Officials to Act
A. H._ Stephens, Superintendent of Rail
way Malls, was notified yesterday of the
success of his efforts to obtain fast mail
trains between Omaha and San Francisco.
The : first new fast mall train, composed
exclusively of mail cars, will leave Omaha
next Sunday for San Francisco. It will
advance the mail now arriving in .this
city at 12:4S p. m. by twenty-four and a
half- hours," and the mail that arrives here
at 5:43 p. m. on the Overland Limited train
by five hours and a half. The new train
will. leave Chicago at 2:80 a. m., Omaha at
l:|iO p. m. of the same day, Ogden 2:55
p.m. next day, and ajrrlve in San Fran
cisco at 12:28 p. m. on the third day, con
suming, from Chicago to San Fransico
58 hours, .or SH.'Ji hours, from' New York.
There will be consumed, eastbound from
San Francisco to Chicago 66 hours, . and
87%'-- hours' from -" San Francisco to New
York. Under the present schedule mails
! leaving this city arrive in Chicago in 76^
! hours and in New York in 103 hours.
There will be a clear gain of two days
la the sending of a letter from New York
and the receipt of a reply at that point.
J. Kruttschnltt, director of mainten
ance- and way of. the Harriman lines,
and H: P. ' Thrall,, who has charge of all
of 'the mail contracts for the Harrlman
lines, have informed the local railway
mail service officials that it is the desire
of the company to make the new mail
train between Omaha and San Francisco
the finest and one of the fastest in the
world. To that end the company will
construct a. sufficient number of all-steel,
modern mail cars, making it one solid
train throughout on the Harriman lines.
These will be the first all-steel mail cars
put into operation. Frequent tests have
been. made of two sample cars construct
ed and the railroad company is of the
opinion that the improved cars will be
adopted by the PoPtoffice Department. .
The addition of fast mail train service
between Omaha and San Francisco, there
by-closing the chain of fast mail trains
between New York and San Francisco,
will probably divert to the New York
Central, the Burlington route and the
Harriman lines, a vast" quantity of mail
for coast points now carried by the Santa
Fc, the Great Northern and the Northern
Pacific railroads.
The compensation for carrying the
mails on railroad lines for the four years
commencing July 1. 1906, will be based
upon the average weight of mail carried
during, a period of 106 days, which will
commence , within - the next few weeks.
This exclusive mall train service will
probably throw to. the Harriman lines a
large quantity of - California mall now
carried ' by the Santa Fe limited train
No. 3,- and probably a large quantity of
Washington mails for the Sound country
now carried by the Great Northern and
the Northern Pacific ; companies. , The
compensation for carrying these mails
will amount to $2,000,000 or more during
the four years. t /
