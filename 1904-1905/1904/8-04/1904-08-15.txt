-. TOKIO. Aug. 14â Flaee .ire Hying,

â¢â¢â¢Hanzai" ere ringing in the irtreeti nf
* Tokio to-night, in honor of the vic
. -tories grained at tea by Admiral Togo
and Vice-Admiral Kamimura.
Underneath the jollification of the
prpulace Ijps a feeling of deep satisfac
tion and gratification at the disposal
of a desperately serious problem of the
â¢wa r.
The Russian squadron which con
fionted Admiral Togo refused battle.
' "It was stronger than Admiral Togo's
squadron in battleships and armored
cruisers, and. had it elected to fight, the
resulted misrht have altered the for
tunes of war. The strength of the
squadron which opposed Admiral Togo
compelled him to draw vessels from the
squadron urder Vicp-Admiral Kami
mura and this left the Japanese navy
.powerless to operate against the Rus
sian Vladivostok squadron and unable
to prevent the raids of these vessels.
* The raid conducted by the Vladi
vostok squadron in July was extremely
cxp'ensive to Japan, and not only was
retaliation tempting, but it was de
. rnanded by commercial interests. The
navy, however, grimly refused to make
. & diversion and stuck to Port Arthur.
It was confident that that harbor eoon
would be untenable for the Russian
â¢warships, that the Japanese would
.eventually get a fair fight in the open
. sea away from the Russian land bat
teries and that they would win. The
' calculations of the navy were correct
and the Russians, with the chances
â¢evened, have been hopelessly defeated.
Vice Admiral Kamimura, after
months of weary and patient waiting,
finally got his chance at dawn to-day
off Teu Island. He sank the Russian
, cruiser Rurik and sent the cruisers
Orcmobol and' Rossia fleeing beaten
from the fight.
Japanese guns dominate the dock
yards at Port Arthur and in view of
â¢ this fact it would seem to be impossible
again to make seaworthy or fightable
. the four Russian battleships which
have returned to Port Arthur. It is
â¢ probable that the Russian battleship
Osarevitch will disarm :tt Tsingchou.
The best possible naval force that
-Russia could now concentrate at Vlad
ivostok Is four cruisers.
In the fighting of August 10 the
rquadron under Admiral Togo was
practically uninjured. The battleship
Mikasa suffered the most, but she con
tihues on the fighting line. The cruis
â¢ers Takumo. Nisshin and Kasaga also
* were hit, but temporary repairs already
'â¢-have been made and they are fully
serviceable.
Eleven wounded officers and sixty-six
â¢wounded men arrived at Sasebo to-day.
The Imperial Prince Hlroyasu Kwacho
was hit In the region of the heart. His
.wouad. however. Is slight.
Previous cablegrams have stated that there were three Rus
â¢ sian torpedo boat destroyers at Tsingchou, and it is probable that
the foregoing should read three destrovers instead of cruisers.

SAN FRANCISCO, -MONDAY,. AUGUST- 15, 1904.
The San Francisco CallEvery reader of the newspapers has
heard from time to time of the efforts
being made by divers to reach the
wrecks of vessels that in years past
have gone to the bottom of the ocean
carrying with them large amounts of
coin and bullion. The most recent
search of the kind is one undertaken
by Greek divers under the Turkish
Government and the treasure discover
ed in the Russian admiral's ship sunk
at Tcherman at the time of the naval
battle of 1770, when the Turkish fleet
was completely destroyed." The search
has continued with striking success.
These fortunate divers have become
rich, but the Turkish Government has
also obtained some large amounts, in
asmuch as it has reserved for Itself the
lion's share. The fact Is that the Rus
sian vessel, which sank in a. depth of
thirty "fathoms, abounds in pieces of
gold and silver. At first the divers
paid attention to the former only, of
which they found full sacks. These
pieces are mostly single, double and
quadruple ducats.
GET A RICH REWARD.
It already has been announced that
on the first shipment to Constantinople
the divers obtained for their part the
Bum of 276,000 francs. The' daily work
of the divers amouns to from 5000 to
10,000 pieces of gold. A special boat of
the admiralty, manned by officers of
the Turkish navy, and by a Govern
ment inspector, is stationed continually
at this point. Each sack drawn from
the water Is registered and the pieces
counted and a receipt given to the
divers.
It appears that the bottom of the
sea Is strewn with silver pieces, which
have the dimensions and the weight of
French crowns of 5 francs. Besides
this money, the divers have drawn up
various other precious objects, gold
and silv.r crosses, jewels, images,
swords, canes, especially an evangel, \)f
which the binding of gold is orna
mented with precious stones of great
value. This is not the first time that
such enterprises have been undertaken
for the purpose of discovering riches
burled In the sea, but they have sel
dom yielded the desired results.
MANY FORTUNES GONE.
It would be difficult to give even a
summary of the innumerable fortunes
engulfed. Among others an English
bark, which foundered in 1799 off the
coast of Holland, had on board lngota
of gold and silver valued at about
$30,000,000, of which a very small part
was recovered. The Royal Charter
went down near the Moelfram with a
cargo worth about $2,000,000. The
greatest fortune engulfed was In the
shipwreck of the French sailing vessel
off the coast of Trafalgar. It carried
a ton and a half of gold plates and
five tons of silver plates, whose desti
nation was the famous cathedral of St.
Jean de 'Malte. : There were also a
large number of precious stories, de
signed : to embellish some relics con
tained in the cathedral, as well as to
adorn various religious objects belong
ing to chevaliers of ,the order and kept
by them ia their chapel.â Exchange.
SHANGHAI, Aug. 14.â It is expected
that the Russian protected cruiser Aa
kold, which arrived at Wusung on Aug
ust 12, will dock to-night.
A press correspondent to-day visited
the Askold. There were many evidences
of a hurried flight and a running fight.
Many of the men on the Askold spoke
highly of the bravery of the Japanese
and of their readiness to fight. They
have no misgivings as to the ultimate
result of the present conflict, however,
and this In spite of the disastrous first
six months. They consider it impossi
ble for "great Russia" to succumb be
fore "little Japan." They say that for
every man who dies another one cornea
out, that for every ship lost another
one will come over the seas, and that
ultimate victory is certain.
Twelve men and one officer were
killed on board the Askold and about
fifty men were wounded. Those who
are badly wounded have be^n taken to
a hospital here, and the captain of the
cruiser has told them to be ready to
sail in a week's time.
In view of the condition of the Askold
(she has nearly 200 shell holes in her)
it is difficult to understand why her
casualty list was not greater.
The work of repairing the cruiser la
proceeding night and day. The crash of
hammers, and the noise of men working
on mental is heard constantly. In ten
days she can be sufficiently patched up
to render her seaworthy, but full re
pairs would take much longer.
An eight-inch armor-piercing shell
entered the Askold forward on her
starboard side, about two feet above
the water line, and lodged in a coal
bunker. A twelve-inch shell exploded
in her starboard hammock netting
amidships, the fragments riddling and
destroying four metallic lifeboats. An
other twelve-Inch shell entered a state
room on the starboard quarter, cut Its
way across the deck and exploded in
the officers' quarters on the port side
of the vessel, destroying everything
within reach. The deckhouse on the
superstructure, under the forward
bridge, was riddled by the fragments
of a shell which exploded in the for
ward funnel. All the searchlights on
the cruiser are damaged beyond repair.
The torpedo netting was cut up by a
shell and Is practically useless. The
bottom of the Askold has several old
and new injuries, one torpedo having
made a big hole through her side into
a bunker, which, happily, was fairly
water-tight. The cruiser's steering gear
is, reported to have been damaged, but
her engines and boilers are in practi
cally good condition.
The Russian torpedo-boat destroyer
Grozovol, which also reached here on
August 12, has no serious damages, but
is inexpressibly dirty and neglected.
She was towed up the river to-day and
took a position alongside the dismantled
Russian gunboat Mandjur.
The forty-eight hours granted the
Grozovol expired at 2 o'clock this after
noon. The Taotai of Shanghai has re
peated his demand that the vessel
leave or disarm. The probability is
that she will disarm.
The hospital-ship Mongolia, which
left Port Arthur on August 10 with
women and children on board, has not
been spoken.
The steamship Gaelic has sighted the
Russian cruiser Novik between Shang
hai and Nagasaki proceeding south-

chart has been prepared Indicating the
action of the level for the past forty
years, commencing with 1863. The level
then stood at two feet above the zero
point. For the four years following
the precipitation was very great. In
consequence of this the level went up
at almost the rate of two feet a year
until 1S68, when it stood at 13V4 feet
above zero â the highest level on record.
Then there was a turning point, and
in the next five years there was a drop
of 7*/2 feet. Again there was an Increase
in the precipitation, and the lake's
level rose unti\ in 1875 it reached 12V6
feet above zero. . V
It Is from this year forward that the
real shrinkage of the lake becomes evi
dent. A steady decline has been in
progress since then, and only once has
there been a rise of any consequence.
It began in 1SS3 and continued until
1886, when the level registered at 9 feet
above zero. Now the precipitation pre
ceding this rise was only 1 inch less
than that which preceded the rise of
1875, yet there was a difference of 3^2
feet in the two water levels.
. In 1900 try? greatest fall on record was
registered, and during the year the
level went down nearly 4 feet. This
oocurred despite the fact that the rain
chart shows that the precipitation for
five years preceding this time was
above the normal. The lake'now stood
at 1 foot below zero. During 1901 it fell
only 2 inches, but again In 1902 It took
another downward leap, reaching 3^
feet below zero. In June of the past
year, l!)03, the season at which, accord
ing to previous records, the level
usually stands at the highest point, it
was 3 feet 9 inches below zero, and still
falling. The annual rise this year
amounted to about 1 foot, as usual, and
yet It is more than 2 feet lower than, it
was this time last year. The precipita
tion this year, too, has been much
greater than it was last. It is therefore
seen that the total fall from 1S86 to
June of the present year amounts to 11
feet 9 inchesâ a fall that has occurred
despite normal precipitation.
! Such has been the rising and falling
of Great Salt Lake since the white man
has become its observer. Its actions
before that time can only be summarily
told by the lake's surroundings; and a
geological investigation of the nine
mountainous islands within the lake
and of the higher elevations inclosing
it discloses evidence that once the level
approximated about 600 feet above the
present surface. This evidence Is in the
nature of ancient water marks on the
sides of the elevations. '" v "

Statistics indicate that Great Salt
Lake, the Dead Sea of America, is
doomedâ that it is gradually drying up.
The opinion now almost universally
prevails among scientists that this
mysterious body of water, located at an
altitude of 4210 feet above sea level and
a thousand miles inland, and which has
but a single rival, the Dead Sea of
Palestine, is certain within the course
of half a century to disappear from
the map. Some scientists, who have
made a careful study of the fluctua
tions of the lake, even declare that it
will be dried up within a quarter of a
century.
Various statistics of. climatic condi
tions, ( including precipitation records,
are complete for Utah .back to 1863,
with scattering accounts for many pre
ceding years, and it has been possible
from these data, although the problem
Is far from being a simple one, to
arrive at these and other conclusions â
conclusions . eo well founded, as shall
herein be shown, that the predicted
destiny of the lake cannot well be dis
puted.
The lake Is subject to annual fluctua
tions, which, up to the 1st of July of
each year, give a rise of water level
usually amounting to about twelve
inches; after July 1 it begins to fall,
and the fall is invariably greater than
the preceding one. We have statistical
proof that this has been going on for
thirty-five years. In the meantime,
however, In addition to the lake's an
nual fluctuations, there have been wet
and dry cycles which temporarily affect
the lake's level to a very great extent.
During one of these wet cycles the level
may rise several feet, but, like the an
nual rises, it always fails to reach the
mark set by the preceding one. In
drawing conclusions these facts must
necessarily be taken Into consideration.
From the close of the year 1886 to
the close of 1902, sixteen years, there
has been a total fall of eleven and a
half feet While this is considered
alarming, measurements show that the
shrinkage has been even more rapid
during the past three years than for
any other like period In the sixteen,
the average fall being one foot per
yearâ that is, one foot after deducting
the preceding annual rise. At this ratio
in forty years the level will be a cor
responding number of feet below Its
present standard, which means that
the lake bottom will ' practically be | a
dry, salt desert. The-- water In what
Is known as the north arm is now a
little less than forty feet deep, and
this is considered the deepest portion
of the lake.
This is one way of reckoning the
time until the Great Salt Lake will
cease to be. Here is another:
Sixteen j r ears ago, in 1886,. the area of
the lake's surface was estimated at
about 2700 square miles. Taking twen
ty feet as the average depth at that
time, we have 1,505,433,600,000 cubic feet
as the contents of the lake. To-day,
according to recent Burveys, the lake
has an area of about 2125 square miles.
Multiplying this number by eleven and
a half, the number of feet in depth of
the water that has disappeared and not
been replaced, gives 669.778,400,000 cubic
feet as the quantity of water less than
what it had sixteen years ago; or,
leaving 835,655,200,000 â¢ cubic feet as the
lake's present contents. At this ratio
of<decrease in quantity In less than
twenty-five years the lake will be
waterless. ,
To show' the effect of cycle fluctua
tions and how the lake is steadily
ehrinking despite temporary rises, -a

by T. C. Porter. The trumpet was re

was led from the diaphragm through
two rubber tubes, at the end of which
were small burner*. The burners were

covered that she had entered the port
of Chefu.
"The Japanese ships waited outside
the port, but the Russian failed to
leave.
"Captain Fujimoto, fearing its
escape by night, if possible, to attack
merchant vessels, entered Chefu with
the two destroyers and found the Rus

undisarmed. #
"Lieutenant Terashima was then
sent to the Russian vessel with a mes

commander expected him to leave by
dawn or surrender.

comply with either demand and while
the conference was still going on -he
was heard instructing his men to blow
up the ship.
"At the- same time he caught hold
of Lieutenant Terashima and threw
him overboard.

There is no additional news regard

"The Japanese on July 25 sent a sum

Ftorm. On the following morning at
6:20 o'clock they concentrated the fire
\if 120 guns on Green Hill. Many of
their shells were filled with melinite,

land guns were supplemented by the
fire of the fleet, and the Japanese in
fantry moved forward to attack the

"There was a perfect cloud of shells

TSINGCHOU, Aug. 14.â I have ob
tained the following details of the
great naval battle off Port Arthur:
The Russian fleet, comprising six
battleships, four cruisers and eight
torpedo craft, left Port Arthur on Au
gust 10 at 7 o'clock in the morning.
A Japanese fleet, consisting of four
battleships, two cruisers and thirty
two torpedo j craft, met the Russians
thirty miles 'from Port Arthur. The
battle was opened by the Japanese
between 11 o'clock and noon and last
ed until sunset, the Japanese being
reinforced soon after the fighting be
gan.
The Russian battleship Cegarevitch
became surrounded by four battle
ships and two cruisers near Shantung
Promontory and received a terrible
fire. Shells were rained upon her
from all sides at close quarters and
the roar of the cannonade was deafen
ing. The Japanese also suffered heav
ily. A twelve-inch shell struck thÂ«
conning tower of the Cesarevltch, and,
rebounding with terrible force, killed
Admiral Withoeft.
Three of the battleship's officers
and twelve men were buried at sea.
Her gun crews were annihilated at
their work and the deck gear was
curled into fantastic shapes like pieces
of tin. The debris was carried hun
dreds of yards.
Eventually the Cesarevitch got
away and arrived at Tsingchou at 11
o'clock on August 11. Her second ad
miral is now in the hospital. One of
her sailors was buried ashore and an
impressive scene was witnessed at the
funeral, which was attended by eGr
man sailors.
The survivors of the Cesarevitch say
Admiral "VVithoeft was torn to pieces
by the shell and his body was swept
overboard, only one of his legs being
found. They describe the scene as an
inferno and say men turned gray from
their experience. Admiral Withoeft
said just before he was killed:
"This is our last fight, men; be
brave."
The orders of the officers could
hardly be heard for the roar of the
guns.
At 4 o'clock on the afternoon of Au
gust 11 one torpedo-boat arrived at
Tsingchou, badly damaged. A half
hour later the Novik came In. She
was uninjured and had no dead
aboard. She took on coal and left
port again at 3 o'clock the next morn-
Ing for an unknown destination.

BUTTE, Augr. 14. â Despite the at
tempts of the local ministers to stop
the affair, an alleged bull fight was
held here this afternoon on the flats
south of the city. The affair was
widely advertised as a humane bull
fight. The animals were not stabbed
or otherwise maltreated, the bull
fighter using only a red cloak to irri
tate the animals. He avoided the mad
rushes by his quickness.
The Butte ministers attempted to
stop the exhibition by appealing to
Governor Toole. The Governor re
ferred the appeal back to the county
authorities.

These assertions made in the textbook of
1900 have been fuliy Justified by the added ex
periences of another four years. The pledges
of 1S!Â»6 and those made In l!K>0 have been re
deemed. The protective tariff nan been re
stored, the gold standard made permanent;
Cuba freed and given Independence; the Pana
ma canal assured, under the Bole ownership
and control of the United States; a Depart
ment of Commerce and Labor established ; rural
free delivery given to millions of the agri
cultural community : the laws for the proper
regulation of trusts and great corporations
strengthened and enforced; prosperity estab
lished; commerce developed; labor protected
and given amplo employment and reward; in
telligence, prosperity and good government es
tablished in distant islands and the flag of
the United States made the emblem of honor
In every part of the world.
All of these great accomplishments have
been the work of the Republican party. In
each of them lt has met the discouragement,
the opposition and the hostility of the De
mocracy. '
The four great facts which justified the Re
publican party In asking the support of the
public In 1!KX> were: First, that its pledges
of 1S!Â»6 had teen redeemed; second, that pros
perity had come as a result; third, that devel
opments since 1S06 had shown the fallacy of
the principles upon which the Democracy then
appealed for public support; and. fourth, the
condition which had come to other parts of
the world and their people as a result of
promises fulfilled by the Republican party In
the United States.

NEW YORK. Aug. 14.â Senator Platt
in an interview to-day made the posi
tive announcement that Ellhu Root
would- accept the nomination for Gov
ernor.
The Herald, in making a poll, merely
aslced its correspondents to see the
chairmen, of the various Republican
county committees in the State and
ascertain from each whom he preferred
as a candidate for Governor this year
and who was his second, choice. The
result showed that the feeling among
the county leaders was overwhelmingly
for Root. Not more than two of .all
those reached declined to express an
opinion and all but three of those who
gave their preference were for Root.
The chairmen of Kings and Rense
laer counties said they were for Tim
othy L. Woodruff and the chairman of
Richmond County declared himself for
George Cromwell, president of the
borough of Richmond. Even the
Rtnselaer chairman said he held Root
as his second choice. The result of the
poll is as follows:
For Elihu Rootâ 23.
For T. L. Woodruffâ 2. .
For George Cromwell â 1.

CONSTANTINOPLE, Aug. 14.â The

fecting American interests in Turkey,
of secondary importance, has been ef

H. H. Yard, president of the Butte
and Plumas Railroad, who has re
cently assumed charge of the West
ern Pacific Railway project; E. J.
Yard, his cousin, who is chief engi
neer of the Denver and Rio Grande
road at Denver, and Virgil G. Bogue,
former chief engineer of the Union
Pacific and now supposed to be act
ing as consulting engineer for the
Goulds, arrived in this city yesterday
from Northern California, where, with
Engineer Dillman of the Western Pa
cific and an engineer of the Butte and
Flumas road, they have been Inspect
ing the proposed routes of the West
ern Pacific.
The party has been in Northern Cal
ifornia for several weeks looking over
the ground, with a view to definitely
determining the exact route to be
taken by the Western Pacific. H. H.
Yard said yesterday that as a result
of the trip it had been decided to
build up the Feather River by way of
Oroville and cut out the Deer Creek
route. Fredonia Pass has been se
lected as the most suitable means of
crossing the State line into Nevada,
where much work is still to be done
by the surveying parties In changing
the original route of the new over~
land road. Although Yard is in charge
of the work of the surveying parties
of both the Western Pacific and the
Butte and Plumas Roads, the two con
cerns are kept distinct and their re
spective engineering parties are work
ing as if for rival corporations. This
idea is being carried out with a view
of obtaining the best results.
It was said yesterday by Yard that
the capital necessary to construct the
road is already assured and a large
portion of it is now on deposit In
the vaults of the Bowling Green Trust
Company of New York. Attorney
Bartnett, who first appeared as the
projector of the Western Pacific, is
still detained in that city in connec
tion v.ith the affairs of the enterprise.
During the coming year, it is expected,
the two Feather River roads will be
consolidated in order to further the
plans of the transcontinental line.
E. J. Yard, apparently acting In the
interests of the Goulds, has been for
over a year, as announced some
months ago in The Call, receiving re
ports of operations at this end of the
route and deciding disputes that arose
between the rival parties engaged in
seelctiner a proper route from the
coast. It Is with n view to finally set
tling up all remaining differences that
he anji Engineer Bogue have made
their present trip to California.

these hounds belonged to his brother,
Dr. Charles T. Laur of Oleans, Ark.,

Mr. Laur recently received word from
his brother that his two hounds were
following a deer, and at last accounts
had crossed the Ohio River between
Metropolis and Joppa, and were still
headed north. He was ready to bet he

OAKLAND. Auff. 14.â Sightless
from an attempt to commit suicide
three years ago, Arthur McGregor, an
Inmate of the State home for the
adult blind, took a fatal dose of poison
to-night at that institution. He left
two letters, requesting Superintendent
Sanders to notify Lieutenant Governor
Alden Anderson and the Woodmen of
the World regarding his death.
McGregor was found in . his room
to-night by the superintendent, who
noticed him breathing heavily.' Dr.
George Derrick, the home's physician,
was called and saw that McGregor
was dying from the effects of some
slow poison, supposedly morphine, al
though no vial or paper that might
have contained the .drug was found.
There was no chance to revive the
man, the poison having taken too
strong hold.
McGregor, three years ago, was
jilted in a love affair at Suisun. >where
he was in the employ of Lieutenant
Governor Anderson at his packing
houses and occupied a responsible po
sition. McGregor .shot himself Jn the
head. His life was .saved, but the
injury destroyed his eyesight Totally
blind, he was admitted to the home,
where he had apparently reconciled
himself to his fate. Superintendent
Sanders said McGrearor had not
seemed to be despondent. .To-day he
had eaten his meals heartily, but had
complained of a slight headache. Mc J

of Albany, N. Y. He leaves a brother

How to obtain dustless highways has
long been a problem to which mu
nicipal supervisors in all parts of the
world have been devoting a great deal
of attention. An official report of the
department, of bridges and roads in
France shows the continuance of good
results obtained in" rendering roads
free from dust by coating the surface
with tar. The engineer of the Seine
and , Marne departments reports that
after an unsuccessful trial of a mixture
of oil and petroleum a coating of tar
was in the summer of- 1902 laid down
on several different lengths of road.
After carefully observing these road3
during a period of twelve . months, he
finds the dust and mud have wholly
disappeared, and the cost of mainten
ance of the roads has been considerably
reduced. Further comparing the pre
vious outlay on the roads with that
of those with tarred surface, he says:
"It appears that the tarring method
requires no greater outlay and at the
same time very "considerably improves
the condition of the roadway. In La
Cher two lengths of the Chausee Na
tionale were coated with tar in June
and August of 1902.; Both these experi
ments have been entirely successful,
the road now being covered with an
elastic skin, while the sound of : foot
passenger's tread is muffled and the
horse and oxen require only one-half
the effort they put forth before. The
noise and vibration caused by ve
hicular traffic is much reduced, and
neither dust nor mud is formed on the
tarred 8urface."âChicago Chronicle.

Before the restoration the better class
of Japanese esteemed it a degradation
to work. A tradesman was desnised.
To-day there is hardly a man of Japan
who does not follow some calling. The
older men. the grandfathers, may stay
at home, but the sons â the restless,
modern, progressive sons of the new-
Japan â are not happy unless employed.
The spirit of modern Japan is In them.
They are as devoted to their business
as to their homes. But they keep them
well separated and apart. The Japan
ese who can afford it has his office in
the big city, but his home In the sub
urbs. During the day he is in the
midst of tha busy stir" and whirl ot
the city, but about 4 in the afternoon
he la hurrying toward the grateful
peace and beauty of his country home.
The first thing he does on reaching
home is to bathe and remove all the
clothes he has worn at his office or
store. With the changing of his'busi
ness clothes he lays aside all thought
of business. In his home he finds de
sired rest and recreation. He is by na
ture a lover of leisure. Few business
men in America would leave their of
fices so early or would take so many
holidays. The Japanese business man
takes all the holidays he can afford.
He is at home most of the fete days.
He goes with his family to see the
carnivals, the temple and flower - fes
tivals. â Harper's Weekly.

One of the most remarkable features
of this case Is the fact that Mr. Hayes'
enlistment papers were signed by the
late Rear Admiral Belknap, whose son
is now on duty in the bureau of naviga
tion, and his discharge papers and
recommendation for the medal were
signed by the late Captain John A.
Winslow, whose nephew is also on duty
In the bureau of navigation and who
signed the letter forwarding the medal
to the naval veteran.
He said in his letter to the depart
ment that he was the only John Hayes
who served on the Kearsarge In the
famous battle with the Alabama, and
that it must be he who Is entitled to
the medal. He forwarded his enlist
ment and discharge papers, which
showed conclusively that his claim was
just.
An investigation -was made by the
bureau of navigation and the old medal
was found in the archives of the de
partment. It has been forwarded to
Mr. Hayes, with a letter from the Sec
retary of the Navy saying that he Is
entitled to $100 bounty, which he can
have as soon as he forwards the proper
affidavits. It la believed that this money
will be quite acceptable, as the old sail
or wrote in his letter that he was
physically unable to work and depend
ed for his living solely on his pension
of $12 a month.
For nearly forty years a United States
Congressional medal of honor awarded
to one John Hayes for distinguished
services on the old frigate Kearsarge
in her historic battle with the Confed
erate ship Alabama has been lying in
a safe in the bureau of navigation wait
ing to be claimed by the man to whom
it was awarded by Congress. â¢
g Rusty, with Its ribbon frayed and
moth-eaten, this medal has at last been
sent to its owner, who after all these
years of silence recently wrote to the
Navy Department claiming the medal.
Its existence had been forgotten until
the arrival a few days ago of a letter
from Muscoda, Grant County. Wiscon
son, from a man 70 years old, who
wrote that he had Just learned through
the accidental reading of an old navy
general order, dated 1864, that John
Hayes, cockswain of the frigate Kear
sarge, had been awarded a medal of
honor for distinguished conduct In bat

MEDAL FOR GAUiANTRY
EARNED FORTY YEARS AGO
Bishop Hamilton of the Methodist
Episcopal Church has returned from
Alaska, where he went six weeks ago.
He brings back a large fund of infor
mation regarding Its resources, with
buoyant spirits in the. anticipation of
the country being a great field for
spiritual and industrial Â§ labor, and
praise for those statesmen who were
farseeing enough to judge of the fu
ture value of the country to the Uni
ted States.
This was Bishop Hamilton's first of
ficial visitâ indeed, the first official
visit fit any Methodist Bishop to that
territory. The purpose of the trip to
Alaska was to organize the district as
a mission and to attend the first annual
meeting of all the Methodist churches
in the district. Bishop Hamilton met
the ministers and lay representatives
of- the Alaskan churches at Juneau
from June 14 to 18.
The churches that were represented
at the Juneau conference are estab
lished at Ketchlkan, Dolomi, Juneau,
Douglas, Skagway and in several min
ing camps. During the conference the
Bishop laid the cornerstone of the
first Methodist church in Juneau, which
is the capital of the district. The
church, which will be named the Metro
politan Methodist Church, will be the
largest and most imposing' edifice of
any denomination in the district ex
cept the Russian church â¢ at Sitka.
More than one-half of the money for
the building was given by the people
in Alaska. The church will be dedi
cated by November and will be abso
lutely free from debt. Many hundreds
were present at the laying of the cor
nerstone, and much interest as well
as local pride was shown by people of
all denominations, and of no denomi
nation, in the new building.
The new church occupies a prom
inent corner on one of the main streets,
directly opposite the site selected for
the capitol. The cost of the building
will be about $15,000. It is said that
such a building, as eligibly located, in
San Francisco would cost more money.
Bishop Hamilton visited all the prom
inent settlements in Southeastern
Alaska and from Skagway went over
the summit by the Yukon and White
Pass Railway toward the Klondike
country. He visited Governor Brady,
the Federal district officers, met Bishop
Rowe of the. Episcopal Church and
prominent clergymen of the Rustelan
and Roman Catholic churches, as well
as of the other churches represented in
the district. '
At the close of the conference Bishop
Hamilton reappolnted the pastors to
their several churches and arranged for
new missions in Seward City, Nome
and Fairbanks, in the Tanana country,
which is the newest gold mining center,
and where there are now reported to be
about 10,000 persons.
In speaking of the prospects of the
country, Bishop Hamilton said last
evening:
I was greatly surprised and encouraged with
the possibilities of Alaska, and I am satisfied
that the purchase was one of the greatest
Investments the National Government has ever
made. Instead of a maplers waste of tree
less Islands and frozen mountains I found a
country where great populations can be more
comfortably accommodated than where many
people now reside, both in this country and In
Europe. The climate in Southern Alaska is
better than that of the Dakotas or even Iowa.
Ten millions of people are found on the
eastern continent above the same parallel of
latitude which forms the southern boundary
of Alaska. The people of Norway and Sweden
and even Scotland could find more comfortable
homes in Alaska and a far more resourceful
country.
Already large investments are being made
in many paying Industries. In addition to the
great discoveries of gold, silver and copper,
tin. platinum, coal and oil are found In great
abundance. One vein of coal thirty feet in
thickness has been discovered in Southern
Alaska, near Kayak.
There is one gold plant on Douglas Island
which has a model in the form ot a pyramid
at the World's Fair in St. Louis representing
$22,000,000 taken from that mine, and dur
ing my visit a far more wonderful mine was
discovered at Seward City. The Alaskan pa
per* represented that this would prove one
of the most wonderful minea in the world.
The fisheries of the district yielded last
year more than $10,000,000, and the seal In
dustry and fur trade alone have repaid many
times over the money the United States paid
Russia for the country. The timber is simply
inexhaustible. I predict ; great possibilities
for the land.
Weather Report.
The law is that a person finding an article
may hold it against the world save and ex
cept from its rightful owner. This being the
case, the company has no more right to the
article than the finder. The requirement that
employes turn over to the lost and found de
partment anything picked up on the train is
a company regulation that does not affect the
case at bar further than to show intent upon
the finder's part of concealing the fact of his
having found the article.
On the other hand, a person has no right to
conceal anything he has found. He must let
it be known. In the present case it will prob
ably Elmmer down to a question of the differ
ence between larceny and embezzlement. In
the first a man takes with intent; in the sec
ond, he finds and afterward appropriates.
Does keeping an article found on a
train and refusing to surrender it to
the company constitute theft? The
question is one passed up to Justice of
the Peace Quinn in the trial of L. E.
Cole, a railway gateman, who. find
ing two telescope baskets on the
Seventh-street local, refused to sur
render them to the company. Cole was
arrested and charged with larceny.
While the evidence in the case is all
in. Judge Quinn is reserving his de
cision, as attorneys on both sides have
authorities they wish to present.
In expressing himself upon this sub
ject, however, Judge Quinn said:

The opportunity to-day to make money In
real estate Is in the district now called Cen
tral Oakland, lying between Broadway on the
east, the bay on the west. Thirty-sixth street
on the south and the Berkeley line on the
north. Thla district, owing to its inaccessibility
in the past, has not been built up, but now
with the increased and excellent car service
rumlsfaed by the Oakland Transit Company's
lines and the new Key route ferry to San
Francisco it In experiencing a boom such as
never before in Its history. New homes are
constantly being built.. and the value of the
land by reason thereof Is constantly advancing.
The Realty, Bonds and Finance Com
pany has just opened another tract in
North Oakland, and Saturday, August
20, sixty residence lots will be sold at
auction. The sale will take place on
the ground at Fifty-first street and
Telegraph avenue. F. J. Woodward of
the Realty, Bonds and Finance Com
pany yesterday said:
With the approach of winter the real
estate market, which has been com
paratively quiet during the vacation
season, has begun to resume activity.
Dealers in Alameda County are receiv
ing many inquiries regarding business
and residence property, a large num
ber of which come from people in the
Eastern States. William J. Laymance
says that he haa lately handled busi
ness for clients in Russia, England,
France, New York, Massachusetts and
Ohio. '
A. F. Cornwall, secretary of the E. P.
Vandercook Company, says:
Business has been rather quiet during the
pa6t two months, but indications now point
to a revival, and I believe that during the
coming fall and winter real estate men will
have all the business they can attend to. One
of the reasons that the present summer has
been dull is that during the past two years
many people have purchased lots on install
ments and are just completing the payments
on their property. Those who have paid for
their lots are now preparing to erect homes,
while others are beginning to buy more prop
erty. Altogether the outlook for the next
three months, both for . the sale of property
and .for building operations, la of the best.
The organized effort being made to
"boost" theÂ»proposed Issue of improve
ment bonds is causing a boom in Oak
land real estate and every dealer in
this city is trying to make a success of
the bonds. The first gun of the cam
paign for bonds will be fired next Tues
day evening at the quarterly meeting
of the Oakland Board of Trade, at
which the issue will be publicly dis
cussed. Among the speakers who will
address the meeting are: Councilman
John L. Howard, Mayor "Warren Olney,
D. Edward Collins, Councilman George
W. Dornin and others. Colonel John
P. Irish has also been invited to deliver
an address.
The meeting is to be held in the as
sembly hall of the Masonic Temple and
an invitation has been extended to the
officers of all the local improvement or
ganizations to attend the meeting and
take part in the discussion. \ Other
meetings of the same character will be
arranged later.
There is no doubt that if the bonds
carry the effect on the local real estate
market will be felt immediately; In fact
the proposal of the. issue has already
increased the value of property in some
portions of the city, for the victory of
the school bonds leads property owners
to believe that the improvement bonds
will also carry.

The <SanÂ£*r of contamination of the city wi
t#r supply by campers in Redwood Canyon and
â¢ long the banks of other creeks which empty
into I-akc Chabot has been discussed by the
Board of Health, but no action will be taken
untit the next meeting of the* board, and it
l^s been practically agreed that. aÂ« the pres
ent camping; reason is so nearly ended, no ac
tion ehall be taken aralnst the people at preÂ»
i-nt in camp. The board intends, however, to
â¢ndeavor to devise tome means whereby the
<ia nicer may be removed.
Personally, I am in favor of keeping camp
*rÂ« away from the banks cf these creeks en
tirely. A recent analysis of the water in the
creek in Redwood Canyon showed tome bac
teria, but no bacteria were revealed by an
analysis of water taken from the lake and
â¢water taken from faucets- in this city wu
â¢ Isn found to be pure. Nevertheless there is
always the danger of contamination as long as
camping if permitted on the banks of these
creeke, and as a measure of public safety the
practice of locating campe on the banks of
creeks emptying in the water company's reser
voirs should be discontinued.
An analysis of the water in the lake
did not reveal any bacteria such as
would be developed by the contamina
tion of the creek by campers. The
board therefore decided to take no ac
tion during the present season, which
is now almost closed. The board will
recommend, however, that as a meas
ure of public safety some action be
taken next season to prevent camping
en the banks of any of the creeks from
which water flows into the reservoirs
of the Contra Costa Water Company.
Dr. von Adeiung in discussing the mat
ter said:
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Aug. 14.
- Campers who have heretofore spent
their summer outings on the banks of
Redwood Creek will be forced to seek
another location next season if the at
tempt that is to be made to induce the
"owners of property situated in Redwood
Canyop to close the grounds to camp
ers is successful. The matter was taken
up at the last meeting of the Oakland
liuard of Health, and Health Officer
von Adelung reported that during the
present season r.early BOO people had
tamped in Redwood Canyon, close to
the banks of the creek, which flows Into
l^ake Chabot. The Health Officer said
as a large portion of the city
v. ater supply came into the lake
through Redwood Canyon it would be
eafer from a sanitary point of view if
tampers were kept away from the
banks of the creek.
RENO. Aug. 14.â H. C. Lawrence, ac
cused of attempting to assassinate J.
D. Garrison, an employe, nearly three
months ago, to-day confessed his
crime. Heretofore he has stoutly main
tained his innocence to the officials of
Churchill County.
In defense of his act Lawrence
claims that he shot Garrison only after
a most desperate struggle in which the
latter attempted his life.
Lawrence is also' feigning Insanity,
claiming that visions of departed rela
tives appear before him. His confes
sion is believed, although, his defense
is not accepted. Lawrence is suspected
of numerous murders in Churchill
County and his admissions to-day only
tend to strengthen the belief that he is
connected with them.
Lawrence came to Nevada from Salt
Lake City. He is even now postmaster
at Hazen and owns some property
there.

The Union League Club of Alameda
County will effect a permanent organ
ization to-morrow evening at Maple
Hall. Permanent officers will be elected
and the league will be put upon an
established basis. The league is in a
flourishing: condition. United States
Senator George C. Perkins is the tem
porary president of the club.
The Union Labor Club of the Forty
sixth Assembly District has decided
upon John Geary, a well-knowji na
tive Eon of Haywards, as its nominee
for the Assembly. He will probably be
indorsed by the Democrat?. j > v
J. R. Knowiand of Alameda City will
be nominated on Tuesday at Vallejo by
the Republican Congressional conven
tion for Congressman from the Third
District. There is no opposition to, Mr.
Knowland. and the action of the con
vention at the navy yard city will
merely be a ratification of the will of
the Republican party as expressed at
the primaries that were held last
Tuesday.
Mr. Knowland is a young man who
has mads himself. An attorney by pro
fession, he entered- the field of politics
some years ago as the Republican nom
inee for the Assembly from Alameda
City. Two terms in the lower house
at Sacramento brought a term in the
upper house, where he served with
credit to his district, his party and him
self. When Victor H. Metcalf was ele
vated to the Cabinet by President
Roosevelt, Knowland was at once sug
gested for the position of Representa
tive in the lower house of the national
legislature, and as a result of the
primaries he will be nominated on
Tuesday next without opposition for a
place on the Republican ticket in a dis
trict where the Republican nomination
is equivalent to an election by about
10,000 majority.
City Councilman George Fitzgerald
to-day made the formal announcement
of his candidacy for the Union Labor
nomination for Supervisor in the Fifth
District against John Mitchell, who will
be the Republican nominee. Said Mr.
Fitzgerald:
"I have not approached a single dele
gate to the Union Labor convention,
but I feel reasonably sure that I can
make a showing in that convention. If
the nomination is offered me I shall
accept."

With the opening of the new term
at the University of California the col
lege Christian associations will inaug
urate a new system for helping stu
dontP earn their way while attending
the university. It will consist In pro
viding an educational department of
commercial courses, so that the stu
dents may equip themselves to take
various kinds of office work. The
courses to be given will be in ste
nography, typewriting and bookkeep
ing, subjects that will be taught by a
corps of competent teachers.
By supplying this department the
Christian associations make provision
for students who hitherto have taken
courses in San Francisco business cdl
legcs In connection with their college
work. This meant something of a
hardship to those undertaking the
double duties. There is a large de
mand for competent stenographers and
bookkeepers in Berkeley and the asso
ciations feel that they are more than
justified in this new enterprise.
Miss Mabel Palmer. '07, will organize
the school and later there will be other
teachers to assist her in the work.

At the rate applications are coming
in, the indications are that the Incom
ing freshman class at the University of
California will be the largest in the
history of this college of learning. Al
ready there are 660 applications for
entrance on file and with another week
to elapse before college opens the num
ber is likely to be swelled to something
more than 700. The 1906 class was
the largest, with its 630 freshmen, and
last year's numbered only 626. This
suggested that the limit had been
reached, but now the signs point to
something even greater.
The matriculation examinations for
incoming students began on Friday in
Harmon Gymnasium. They will end
en Tuesday, after four days of work
in all the subjects which candidates
are required to pass. These examina
tions are intended for freshmen seek
ing admission to the academic depart
ment. Hastings College of Law and
the medical department.
Registration will begin at the gymna
sium at 9 o'clock on Thursday morn
ing. As was the rule last year, upper
class students will pay $2 for the priv
ilege of late registration, except that
graduate students will not have to pay
the fee if they register before August
29.
Instruction for upper class students
will begin at 1 o'clock on Thursday.
On Monday the organization of in
struction for freshmen will begin and
the first university meeting will be held
at 11 o'clock, when President Wheeler
will deliver the welcoming address and
several others will make speeches.

Fully 200 Knights Templar assembled
at the triennial headquarters yesterday
afternoon in response to an invitation
from the executive committee. Eminent
Sir Brilsford P. Flint, grand generalis
simo, Grand Commandery of California,
presided and stated that late report*
indicate a much larger number of vis
iting Sir Knights than was expected,
and that it would require a larger sum
of money to suitably entertain them.
Grand Commander W. Frank Pierce
presented an outline of the entertain
ment prepared for the visitors, extend
ing over a period of two weeks and
commencing with the arrival of the
grand master and Grand Encampment
of the United States, on Monday, Aug
ust 29, one week in advance of the con
clave.
The programme included free enter
tainments for the visitors for each day
and evening until the end of the con
clave; banquets, promenade concerts,
excursions, theatrical performances, re
ceptions and even free car rides for the
visitors on certain daj-8. He urged that
the visitors will be the guests of all
citizens of San Francisco and of Cali
fornia, and that it was essential that
California's reputation for hospitality
be maintained, no matter at what cost.
Other speakers referred to the perma
nent benefit which accrued to Califor
nia from a former conclave, when sev
eral thousand Templars attended a con
clave In this city twenty-one years aso
and hundreds made their homes in Cal
ifornia subsequently.
Among the speakers were the follow
ing: J. C. Campbell, A. A. Watklns,
John F. Merrill, Samuel M. Shortridge,
George H. Pippy and ex-Lieutenant,
Governor Jacob H. Neff. To test the
feeling of the assemblage Mr. Nen! pro
posed to oijen a subscription list at
once and afford the members of the or
der a chance to subscribe. He started
the subscription with $100 and quickly
added $100 more. Within a short time
more than $2500 was subscribed, though
most of those at the meeting had sub
scribed before. With some it was a
third contribution. Oakland Command
ery announced that it had subscribed
$1000, with the understanding of more
if needed. The Scottish Rite bodies of
California added $250 to the list.
The following volunteered to raise all
the money needed among their friends
within a few days and were assigned to
certain districts within the city: F. H.
Gould, Franklin H. Day, A. A. Watkins,

It had been the secret hope of many
DC us who had helped with our tongues
and Dens to raise the landmarks fund
of the Examiner, that the $1300 lying
idle in the pafe would be turned over
to the league that its work might go
.on unhampered. The request was, how
ever, denied in polite and politic terms.
i-ut denied none the less. Mr. Hearst
wished the money to buy a pile of
adobes on a back street of Monterey,
-tailed by courtesy the first theater in
Californiaâ whir h carries with it no his
toric value whateverâ and a tumble
down hut that nobody wants and the
"Legislature won't take over as State
Propei U. lest, indeed, Mr. Hearst can
hypnotize it into doing an unpsfrdon-
Rtoly Eturid thing. It is true that this
f'ece of property was on the list fur
nished the Landmarks Fund advisory
ccmm!ttee by the Examiner, and so
were other worthless properties â worth
less historically and nearly worthless
commercially. But the committee picked
'out the three really historical proprr-
HEARST STILL HOLDS FUNDS.
All work, including- the bronze tab
let placed by the lengue two years
ago upon Fort Gunnybags, has been
done with extreme economy. The
lumber now lying in the patio of the
mission was obtained in a hitherto
unknown mill in the Santa Lucias â
ttie Brothers' mill â at a third
less than the market Quotation in
t-an Francisco, exclusive of freight.
Then the labor at the mission was
in a measure the labor of love â for
a-mong the people round about were
frix men whose forbears sleep within
the shadow of the mission, who con
tributed a week's work each â and
they worked that week with a will
born of love. From September 1
until the end of November these men
continued to work at $1 per day and
board, the secretary going down to
Jolcn and starting a provision camp.
which was maintained at the cost of
$11 per man per month, with good
and plentiful rations. The superin
tendent, J. Alonzo Forbes, a practical
i.uilder and student of mission archi
tecture as it was practiced by the
Padres, received J60 per month for
services worth three times that sum.
but the mission must be saved and
money was scarce. Living in its midst
for thirty years, watching it year
by year falling victim to vandals "and
the elements, he. like all who have
fallen beneath the spell of its beauty
and its tragedy, gave of his store of
knowledge generously.
And thus did the 51*300 of the league's
funds avaunt. Now there's more lum
ber to pay forâ the lumber now in the
patio under the olive trees and the
. pomegranates. It must be paid for and
:t must be lifted aloft to clothe those
trusses that stretch bare from wall to
ag-ainst the sky. And it is clearly
the dutv of Californians to do it, lest
they prove themselves unworthy the
magic name.
The appeal goes first to the mem
bers of the league that they who are
In arrears may pay up and that they
may bend their energies to recruit
new. members. A dollar â the yearly
due â is but a thousandth part of the
sum now needed to complete the roof
on Mission San Antonio de Padua, the
abandoned old sanctuary now leased
to the league; but suppose a thou
sand people send in a dollar â proving
their love of State no boastful fiction
â then would the league go on its
way rejoicing. Then would the men
uboot the mission be set to work to
complete their labors of last fall,
which â to our shame as Californians
l>e it said â was discontinued because
ihe fund on hand had become ex
hausted. Why hide from ourselves
the truth!
Since that time the lumber has been
lying in the old mission garden, 'twlxx
the olive trees and the pomegranates,
awaiting its destiny on old mission
loof â and it is still waiting. The
half-ruined adobe walls have been re
stored, the roofless chapel, which is
the sepulcher of five of the noblest
men who ever flgured in the pages
of American history, has been cleared
of the debris of a quarter century.
And with it went the wildflowers â
the mute tribute planted by nature
over the graves of the padres.
WORK DONE BY THE LEAGUE.
This much is done! And in the
doing let the following facts be
known: Every dollar paid into the
league has gone into actual work â
no officer, not excepting the archi
tects (Newton J. Tharp and Will D.
Shea), receiving compensation for ser
vices.
The Landmarks League will this
week send forth an appeal to all pa
triotic Californians â naj'. Americans,
because the structures which the
league Is seeking to save are likewise
milestones in the nation's history â
that funds be obtained to complete
the work now in hand and but half
complete.

Hopes of a revival from the summer

ized. Many clever people are return
ing to town, shutters are coming down
from hitherto deserted houses and
things will soon begin to hum.
The merry -buzz of the "tea" will
soon be heanf in the land and by the

dertake a continuous performance.
Fellow CalifornJans, you who feel an
exaltation of pride when you contem
plate the glories of your State and the
proud position it has taken in the na
tion, measure that thrill by the dollar
standard. Is it worth a dollar? If so,
contribute that dollar to the task of
blotting: out from its name the stain
that clings to it for permitting 1 its
famous old missions, the most beautiful
monuments in America and of a by
gone age and race, to go on to ruin and
ultimate decay.
Meanwhile lumber bills must be met.
the roof must go on now lest the walls
disintegrate again from the winter
rains, and the league must dig up the
money from somewhere.
FCXDS MUST BE RAISED
ties and these were accordingly pur
chased by the funds raised at that
time, which were the landing place of
Sebastian Viscaino (1G02) and Junipero
Sena (1770); the property at old Fort
Ross, with its round towers and its
queer old Russian chapel, and the old
Mission of San Francisco Solano (.So
noma), which had fallen into private
hands and was in use as an adjunct to
a saloon and for a stable. These were
purchased and the deeds passed to Mr.
Hearst as trustee until such time as
:he t?tate would take them over. It
was supposed at the time â and explicit
ly statedâ that the league would hold
the temporary title, but Mr. Hearst
thought otherwiseâ they looked well 1 In
the Hearst name.
And now the $1COO that remained from
these purchases has Ia.ln idle in the
Hearst safe for a year.
It is this money that friends and
members of the league hoped would be
given over for the work now suspended.
a goodly part of which money was ob
tained under the belief that it was to
be expended by the Landmarks League.
However, since Mr. Hearst says he
won't, it looks as though he won't!
But the -league members are still in
hopes that he may yet become a good
enough Californlan to hand over the
moneyâ the money that is not hisâ
thereby keeping faith with the advisory
committee and the public, whose money

and vigilant in the detection of evil influences, have
voiced a protest against the display and sale of obnoxious
publications and pictures. In the campaign which these
gentlemen have commenced to suppress the outrage they
should not forget that through the negligence and con
nivance of officials the demand for this refuse of the
printing press has increased largely because the class to
which it panders has been permitted to increase.
Certain municipal employes, more eager and insistent
in the agitation of desired favors than in the perform

uncomplaining taxpayers. We. who are not of the ma

THE Oakland City Council has fixed September 27
as the date of the bond election. The issue is for
parks, boulevards,' a new City Hall, a polytechnic
school and needed necessary public improvements.
Intending to further promote this enterprise, we take
occasion now to say to our Oakland friends that no city
was ever improved to death. Cities are improved into
more abundant life always. They die of dirt and in
ertia. If this bond issue is ratified, as we are persuaded
it will be, at the polls, the first year's tax in payment
of it will be only $3 25 on the $1000. After that the
amount declines. We are within reason in saying that
the moment the issue is ratified every $1000 worth of
property in Oakland will be advanced in value to more
than twice the amount of the first year's tax, and that
as the improvements are made this advance will con
tinue in a constantly enlarging ratio.
The situation of Oakland is unrivaled for beauty and
salubrity. Nature cut the bottom out of her purse of
gifts and graces in behalf of that location. But man
has heretofore been too content to let it go at that, with
out assisting the unspent energies of nature to improve
upon her first work. Now that community is quickened
by a new spirit and the capacities of their town appear
to them in a raised vision, that is formed of a union of
charms with an impulse to material prosperity.
There are not many cities in the world whose every
part is as flawless as Oakland. It has no place where
slums can permanently lodge, none where things low
and unsightly can naturally gender and fester. Every
blojck in it can receive graces and attractions that hold
the fancy of the observer. When these proposed im
provements are made in the spirit that has prompted the
undertaking, but few cities in the world will display as
many charms. And then the people will discover that
they have only made a beginning, and will clamor .foV
more and longer steps forward, guided by the experience
gained in taking those now so carefully and wisely
planned.

On one of Mark Twain's later trips
down the Mississippi he made the
journey Incognito in order to gather
material for stories about Mississippi
pilots, and the following story was told
by a man who knew him well, of the
way Twain was discovered: "The
steamer was hardly under way when
through the automatic action of the
brain, the author instinctively wan
dered to the pilot house, and essayed
the role of the greenhorn. The pilot
loaded him with the kind of river chaff
and badinage that must have recalled
the days of his youth more vividly than
would have the taste of one of his
grandmother's pies, and our author was
enjoying it as keenly as If he were at
a country circus, stowing away page
after page of the most delightful ma
terial, and secretly hugging himself
with the thought that he was getting
a large amount of the most desirable
copy from the very source to which
he had looked most longingly, and for
the acquisition of which he had been
racking his brain In an effort to decide
as to the best method of procedure. At
the moment when he decided on beat
ing a retreat, in order that his stenog
rapher might take down the interview
while it was fresh in his mind, the pi
lot left the wheel, and, turning to Mr.
Clemens, calling him by name, said:
'Here, you take her and lie awhile â
you're handier at it than I am. Trying
to play yourself for a stranger and an
innocentl Why, .1 knew you before you
bad spoken seven words, and I made
up my mind to find out what was your
little game. It was to draw me out.
Well, I let you, didn't I? Now, take the
wheel and finish the watch, and next
time play fair and you won't have to
work your passage.' " The results of
this trip were incorporated in the sec
ond half of "Life on the Mississippi."

A measure submitted for adoption to the Legislature
of Georgia provides that all fathers of six children
shall be honored with the title of colonel and fathers of
ten children shall be elevated to the dizzy dignity of a

sustained by hope, this presents to everybody out of
Georgia. What a magnificent opportunity it affords to
make a Georgia colonel mean something in the beneficent
scheme of things.

HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL,
6. HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN. LONDON, Aug. 1.â As head
of the- great Peninsular and Oriental
Fteamship Company, S!r Thomas Suth
erland is an extremely important perscn
ege^n these days, when sober English
rtatcsmen are seriously discussing the
possibility of war resulting" from Rus
Â¦ eia's seizure of several liners cf his big
fleet. In accordance with English cus
tom. Sir Thomas has carefully refrained 1
from oxnr&ssing any public opinion on
the controversy, but it is known that he
1? in constant communication with the
Government and stronuously insists
that Russia should be compelled*to pay
end apologize for her transgressions of
the neutrality lavs and to stop the sort
of game she is nov,- playing against
Britain's mercantile marine.
Sir Thomas Sutherland is one of the
rr.ost interesting and remarkable of
England's captains of industry. He is
a product of that combination which
has given so many distinguished men
to the worldâ poverty and Scotch birth
and ancestry. He was born in Aber
deen in 1S34. His father, a reduced gen
tleman, had gone to the colonies in the
hope of making a fortune, but lost
Â¦what little money he had and died.
Soon after young Thomas was adopted
bv his maternal grandfather, a retired
fish curer. This worthy man, like many
cf the middle class Scotch, found the
chie/ solace of his old age in the^stern
creed of Calvin. He sent his grandson
to the Aberdeen grammar school and
Fubsequently entered him at the uni
versity there that he might be trained
for the ministry. But Thomas, after
much youthful wrestling with theolog
ical problems, discovered that he lacked
the religious enthusiasm essential to a
Fuccessful pulpit career, and, what is
more to the point, succeeded in con
vincing his grandfather that he was
unfitted to uphold a harsh and narrow
creed by precept and example in a
ekeptical world. He was therefore
â¢withdrawn from the university and put
into a merchanfs office in Aberdeen.
Â¦ While here he chanced to hear some
talk of a Mr. Allan, an old friend of
his grandparents, who had become the
manager of a steamship company. That
fired him with an ambition to follow his
example. He asked his grandfather to
write to Mr. Allan to inquire if he could
find an opening for an energetic youth
In the same line. The result was that
et 18 years of age Thomas Sutherland
Tvas installed as a junior clerk in the
office of the great Peninsular and Ori
ental Company. It soon became no
ticed in the office that any work In
trusted to Thomas Sutherland was sure
-to be done well, and that he didn't
mind working overtime to do it. His
advancement was rapid, but he kept
his eye open all the while for larger
opportunities.
At 20 years of age he seized a chance
to go to Hongkong in the service of the
company. Here he found a field in
which he could display his rare powers
of organization, and soon rose to be
superintendent of. the affairs of the
company in the Far East, with prac
tically a free handâ a fact of which he
took full advantage. He mapped out
tew routes, new coasting services and
started the dock" company, whose huge
works at Hongkong add so much to Use
vaVue of that port as a naval base. The
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Com
pany, one cf the most important of
Far Eastern financial concerns, was
also started by him, and at 30 years of
age he was appointed one of the three
unofficial members of the Colonial Leg
islative Council. All these signal proofs
of his ability convinced the directors
that he was the sort of man whose
talents could best be employed at head
quarters, and In 18G9 he was recalled
home to take a prominent position in
the management of the company's af
fairs.
Up to that time the business of the
company had been practically a mo
nopoly, but the opening of the Suez
canal and the consequent change In
the usual route to India and the Far
Bast so changed the situation that the
company was threatened with ruin. Its
revenues declined at an alarming rate.
In this emergency It wes felt that
Thomas Sutherland was the one man
connected with the company who might
etem the tide of adversity that had set
eo strongly against it. He. was made
manager and given a frceTiand.
. "It was what the Yankees called a
hard road to hoe," he said when speak
ing: cf this crisis In his career, "but I
hoed it." With consummate ability he
confronted the altered conditions,
changed the methods of the company,
created a new fleet and not only saved
the treat concern, but increased its
business until It has attained its pres
ent splendid position in the maritime
and mercantile world. When he took
charge of the company its fleet repre
sented a tonnage that footed up 80,000
tens. It now amounts to 400,000 tons
divided between seventy vessels valued
*u between $50,000,000 and ' JGO.000.000.
The man who, rising from the humble
billet of a junior clerk, can point to
puch an achievement has certainly done
something to be proud of.
For twenty-five 'years he has been
chairman of the company, and is likely
to hold that position for another ten
years at lea.st. Although 70 ycara of
age. hale, erect and vigorous, he looks
hardly a dsy over 55, and is as brimful
of fight as ever. His favorite recreation
Is golf, and toe has his own private links

Michael Marton, the American adap
ter of "Resurrection," who is now
Beerbohm Tree's right hand man, is
responsible for the English version of
"La Montansier," in which Lena Ash
well is to star. This is the French play
in which Rejane and Coquelin ap
peared together. Much was expected of
it and I fancy that Miss Ashwell must
have secured the English rights before
the play's production, for only the pop
ularity of the two stars saved it In
Paris and the London critics found it
indifferent when the French company
gave it here. It was at this time that
A. B. "Walkley, the Times' dramatic
authority, wrote, "One hears that there
is to be an English version of this
piece, but there is no need of meeting
trouble half way."
John Hare will not be seen in Lon

HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL,
5 HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN, LONDON, Aug. 1.â Since
the immense success of "Mrs. Dane's
Defense," some three years ago, play
after play by Henry Arthur Jones has
been produced in London, but America
theatergoers may have been struck by
the fact that so far not one of these
pieces has reached the United States.
This season, it seems, Mr. Frohman is
going to see what "Whitewashing
Julia" will do in America, but the com
edy In question is the only one of the
playwright's recent efforts that would
have the slightest chance of success at
homi?. In the old days, when Jones
was producing pieces like "The Liars,"
"The Maneuvers of Jane" and "The
Bauble Shop." it would have been safe
to prophesy that the new play from
his pen with which Arthur Bourchier
is to reopen the Garrick would be seen
in the United States soon afterwardâ
to-day it is another matter. However,
though it is long since Jones had a
real sure enough success, this most
prolific of British dramatists has been
on the up grade recently. In "Chance,
the Idol," with which he followed
"Mrs. Dane's Defense," he came an
awful cropper, but "The Princess'
Nose" was better, though too slight
for success as a three-act play. "Jo
seph Entangled," written just before
"Whitewashing Julia," was admirable
half way through and Cyril Maude
gave It at the Haymarket for over 100
nights, but it is not likely that the
capacity of that playhouse was taxed
at any point in the run. Counting "The
Lackey's Carnival" and "Mrs. Dane's
Defense," Jones has produced during
the last three years no less than six
plays. During the same period his
great. rival, Pinero, has put forth two
only, "Iris" and "Letty," but, oh, how
different! Perhaps, however, Jones
will score again with his new piece at
the Garrick. The name has not yet
been revealed.
Londoners who have not yet had the
opportunity of seing a really worthy
play by Israel Zangwill are waiting
with much curiosity for "Merely Mary
Ann." which, with Eleanor Robson,
Mr. Frohman now announces for the
Duke of York's "early in September."
Not much good fortune attended this
playhouse during the past season. It
was opened with Pinero's "Letty,"
after which was given "Captain
Dieppe," which proved so fiat a failure
that a revival of Marshall's "His Ex
cellency, the Governor," had to be put
on hurriedly. "The Rich Mrs. Rep
ton," R. C. Carton's much heralded
play, also proved a failure, so Mr.
Frohman turned his theater over to
Forbes Robertson, who wanted it for
his new production, "The Edge of the
Storm." But this was another frost.
A revival of "Mice and Men" also
failed to attract, so the management
gave it up and the playhouse was
closed for the season.

The London Stage.
"Ah, say, you're de guy what ad
vertised for cats and we've brung you
a lot of 'em, see?"
The barber protested that he want
ed no cats and just then a boy came
along carrying a huge basket filled
with specimens of the feline family.
To add to the barber's consternation
a wagon drove up to. his shop and the
driver unloaded a chicken coop con
taining at least thirty cats, saying. "I
guess these will hold you for awhile."
The barber by this time was frantic
and, refusing to open up his shop,
fled from the scene in dismay. Now.
if any one desires to make that bar
ber frantic, all that is necessary is to
yell, "cats," or "mee-ow" when he ap
proaches. â¢
That morninsr a motley crowd of
youngsters stood In front of the shop
just as the barber came along to open
up for the day. The boys carried all
sorts and conditions of cats in their
arms. The barber wanted to know
the meaning of it all and one of the
crowd who had a sack full of cats in
formed him.
No Cats for Him.
A certain barber In the Mission dis
trict has a marked aversion to cats
and it all came about in this wise.
Some practical joker inserted an ad
vertisement in one of the morning
papers recently to the effect that an
unlimited number of cats was wanted
at once at the shop of the aforesaid
barber. The advertisement stated
that it did not matter if the cats were
mangy, cross-eyed, blind or had any
other physical defects, that fifty cents
would be paid for each one.

THERE is now under way in England a widespread
movement 'that may well find an .energetic and
determined counterpart jin the Unitea States. The
English traveling public has been aroused to the
serious menace involved in the unsanitary condition of
railway coaches, which, in their uncleanliness and in
the manifold inconveniences of their construction, have
become recognized agents for the dissemination of dis
ease. Travelers' associations are being organized, the
indorsement of physicians, men of affairs and the public
generally has given unquestioned dignity to the cam
paign of reform, and representations, strong enough to
demand attention, will be made to the transportation
companies to correct the evil.
If conditions in England warrant so emphatic a dis
cussion, it is palpable that in the United States, where
the traveling public is much greater and where the
movement of all classes and character of people is prac
tically without supervision, the urgency of protection is
immediate. The menace of railway coaches as carriers
and distributors of disease has been a subject of desul
tory consideration in American medical journals; but
while the existence of the evil has been accepted, no
popular interest, designed to suppress it, has been
aroused.
First-class transportation In the United States is such,
generally speaking, only from the point of view of fare,
not accommodation. Provision is yet to be made for
ordinary comforts and the common decencies of inter
course between men and women. Efforts have been
made, in warnings earnestly and repeatedly made, to pro
tect travelers from the germs of tuberculosis, but noth
ing further ha3 been done. The railroads will not take
the initiative and the public, victims of unsanitary,
crowded, dark and dust-laden coaches, seem not inclined
to do so.
Common sense, fortified by the conclusions of medical
science, dictates that railway coaches should be well
lighted, completely ventilated and so constructed as to
be subjected in- every interior part to sunshine. Draperies,
cushions and all the unnecessary gimcracks of ornamen
tation that collect and hold dust should be replaced by
comfortable, durable, washable stuffs. The dust of rail
way coaches is germ-laden and its burden is disease,
inhaled by the susceptible.
Another feature of reform in American travel, and
one that sooner or later will be recognized as absolutely
vital, is the separation of passengers unfortunately af
flicted with infectious disease from travelers not so con
ditioned. One of the transcontinental railway com
panies has suggested such an arrangement in its service,
but the proposal has met with the apathy of the public.
That the evil is insidious and in its discussion cause is
s'o difficult to trace from effect are not sound reasons
why the matter should not be one of immediate public
concern.
Travelers' associations should be formed in the United
States, communities should interest themselves in an af
fair so intimately associated with their health, transporta
tion companies should be asked to remedy evils easily
overcome, and if necessary legislative action should be
invoked to accomplish the result.
In our local markets the feature last week was the
sudden quieting down in general business. It was gen
eral and seemed to begin abruptly, in one day. There
was general complaint of a slack demand for all sorts
of merchandise, heretofore active. Nobody seemed to
know what caused the sudden quietude, but everybody
remarked it. It was particularly noticeable in some of the
products of the farm, though manufactured goods were
also affected. Lower prices resulted in a number of
cases. It might have been the long-expected arrival of
the wave of dullness, which has been slowly rolling
across the continent toward us for some months, or it
might have been one of the periodical lulls which occur
in midsummer and midwinter and which appear and
disappear without any assignable cause, like a passing
breeze on a quiet day; but whatever caused it, it was
perceptible. . /,
There is one unpleasant and serious feature to our
coast trade at present .which needs immediate and ener
getic attention, and that is the preservation of our Ori
ental trade. We must not let any war between two
Oriental nations divert it from us. This coast is the
natural geographical field, depot and supply area for
the Orient, and it must continue so. It is too big a
commercial plum" to relinquish. Happily, our merchants
seem alive to the situation and have already taken steps
to retain this valuable trade, which means so much to
San Francisco and the whole Pacific Coast
IN SPITE of a falling off of J5-9 per cent in the coun
try's bank clearings last week, as compared with the
corresponding week last year, and a decline in the
aggregate cleaxings to about $1,670,000,000, the low
est figures touched for several years, commercial re
ports last week reported a slow expansion in trade in
most sections, with the tone of the advices of a decidedly
cheerful and sanguine cast. The two conditions do not
harmonize. If there is really an expansion in trade the
bank clearings ought to show it by an increase, while
any marked decrease in die clearings indicates a cor
responding falling off in the volume of business.
There are two conditions, however, which may explain
the apparent contradiction. One is, that while business
may really be expanding, the lower prices for many
commodities may diminish the clearings sufficiently to
offset the expansion when the net showing is made.
Another. is a dull speculative market in Wall street,
which in itself would cut down the volume of clearings
materially. Perhaps both of these factors prevail.
Briefly, the actual volume of trade may be expanding,
while the lower plane of quotations for some important
lines of merchandise may reduce the amount of money
necessary to carry on the trade; and this, in connection
with a dull stock market, would naturally reduce the
aggregate clearings. But this, of course, is conjecture.
But aside from these theories and abstractions, it is
a fact that the reports now coming in from different
parts of the country continue to improve week after
vcek. The jobbing trade is not equal to last year's
and the industrial conditions could be more promising,
but aside from the damage to the 'wheat crop, which,
as far as ascertainable at present, amounts to about 10
1-er cent, reducing the crop from a previously estimated
yield of 625,000,000 bushels to somewhere about 565,000,
000 as a rough calculation, the crop prospects of the
country are very fine. A prominent Western bank last
week sent out inquiries to 1042 banks in as many dis
tricts in Alabama, Arkansas, Dlinois, Indian Territory,
Iowa, Kansas, Kentuqky, Louisiana, Michigan, Okla
homa, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas and through
out the Middle West, which brought answers of crops
retarded by cool nights and unfavorable weather, but
that in spite of this all crops except wheat showed an'
increase over last year. As the crop prospects are the
overshadowing and ruling factor in trade this year, it is
probably this which gives to the current commercial
situation its brightening aspect.
These excellent crop prospects come at the very time
when they are most needed, for business was beginning
to languish. Now, the dullest tradesman can see that
with abundant crops and an active demand for them at
prices above the normal, business cannot become very
dull. With a I2,ooo,ooo-bale cotton crop, a 2,500,000,000
bushel corn crop, a 565,000,000-bushel wheat crop and
a very large yield of hay, which is one of the largest
sources of, revenue possessed by the country, the farm
ing districts will be alive with activity, the mills be kept
running, the railroads have all the freight they can han
dle, the banks multifarious channels for the profitable
placement of their funds, the merchants increased orders
for goods and the manufacturers easy "outlets for their
products. All this is but another name for trade activity
and continued prosperity; not a boom, perhaps, but a
good, steady, normal trade movement, beneficial to the
capitalist and wage-earner, the merchant and farmer, and
the transportation lines, which furnish employment to
great armies of men.
Such is the situation to-day. True, some lines are
dragging and some sections of the country report busi
ness quiet, but the country as a whole is in excellent
condition. Provisions are dull and the packing-house
strike in the West is cutting down the volume of trade
in that region; predicted lower prices for cotton are ren
dering buyers cautious about laying in supplies, but there
are signs of improvement in the dry goods trade, and
late advices from New York emphatically say that the
improvement in the iron trade, hinted at lately, is more
than mere talk. Orders for over 110,000 tons of pigiron
have lately been placed, which indicates an increasing
movement in this line. The wool industry is in excellent
condition, prices for raw wool being excellent and the
demand for the clip large and lively.
As for the question of ready cash for the conduct of
business, a New York banker, who keeps himself thor
oughly posted on current trade conditions, says: "There
is no need of concern about the monetary situation. Our
local banks carry a big surplus reserve of about
$60,000,000, which is the largest in many years at this
period. The West and South are also amply supplied
with funds, and the crop' and business demands are not
likely to cause any embarrassment in the money mar
kets. On August 1 the stock of money in circulation in
the United States was $2,546,000,000, a net increase of
$164,000,000 in the last twelve months. Of this increase
$24,000,000 was in gold coin, $114,000,000 in gold certifi
cates and $31,000,000 in national bank notes. During
the last seven years we have added about $650,000,000 to
our stock of gold and about $200,000,000 or more to our
supply of bank notes, raising the per capita circulation
in that period from $23 to $31. Such an enormous in
crease in our currency Bupply, out of all proportion to
growth of requirements, is sure, if maintained, to have
a stimulating effect upon values, especially when the
latter are upon a lower plane than formerly, as* is now
the case."

It has been the belief for a Ion? time
that a very considerable body of copper ex
isted In the vicinity of Edfn Valley, If the
deposit could only be located.
About thirty years ago Henry Abbott, for
merly County Clerk of thiÂ« county, did soma
â¢work on a copper prospect about two miles
from the present discovery.
BlncÂ« then at various tlrma other parties
have done considerable work on different pros
pects, but. as stated above, heretofore no ledge
In place has been discovered, the specimens
of ore found apparently being float.
Nothing has yet been done to locate the
west wall and the little work done has been
too puncrficla! to determine the surrounding
formation, but frcm surface indications It Is
Â«=ald to bf a contact vein with serpentine on
one Bide and sandstone or slate on the other,
as both the later occur In close proximity
on the west side of the vein.
Specimens of rich copptr ore have from
time to time been found In the vicinity of
Eden Valley, but heretofore no clearly de
fined ledge has been located.
A pit about six feet deep was dug and a
clearly defined wall was found on the east
side of the ledge and in contact with this
wall was found quite a body of malachite or
carbonate of copper, which Â»o far has In
creased In thickness with th* increasing
depth. This malachite Is very rich and it Is
said that this Is the first ore of this character
ever found In Mendocino County.
Robert Singleton and William Ellis were
making a road from Mr. Singleton's place
out to the public road and struck the top
of the ledge. A little prospecting developed
the presence of a clearly defined led^e-. ap
parently of very considerable wealth and ex
tent. Rich specimens of ore were taken out
for a distance of seventy-five feet along the
length of the ledge and for twenty 'feet, or
more across It.
The Uklah Dispatch-Democrat re
ports that a promising ledge of copper
was recently uncovered near Eden
Valley, in Menddcino County. The
journal in question says In part:
Discovery Is Made In Vicinity of
Eden Valley.

URBAN* GROWTH IN SOUTH.
Cities That Beautify Country Beyond
Tass of Tehachapl.
The growth of cities in Southern
California forms the subject of an in
teresting review by the Los Angeles
Herald, which is, In part, as follows:
In no country under the sun has there been
a more remarkable record of city growth than
In Southern California during the last twenty
years, particularly between Point Conception
and the Mexican line. Of course. Los Angeles
comes first, with an undoubted population of
150,000 â Indeed, probably more, from 10,000
and a couple of hundred, by the United States
census of ISSn, 50,000 and some odd hundreds
by that of l?tfO and 102,000 by that of 190O.
But astonishinr as are th?se tigures they by
no means tell the whole story.'
Twenty years ago Pasadena was a pretty
little village. To-day it numbers approxi
mately 15.000 Inhabitants and ia stretching
out bravely to encompass the beautiful country
rcund about it. To the southward lies San
Dieco, whose boomers claim a present popu
lation cf 2O.C00 to 25.0OO for their beautiful
city. Twenty years ago 5000 or 6000 would
have been ths figure. "All by its lonely" this
town of Horton's unlimited faith during the
past year or so has been getting ready for a
boom, which now shows signs of materializ
ing.
To the northward Santa Barbara has devel
oped into a pretentious citv which, if it keeps
up ita lick, will soon be as large as some of
the cities of the Riviera which have taken
1000 years or more to attain their present
status.
The roster of Southern California cities â for
they are entitled to that name by an act of
the California Legislature â is calculated to
amaze the newcomer to this section. In ad
dition to those named, there Is a long list of
absolutely new municipalities, such as River
side, Redlands, Pomona, Santa Ana, Orange,
Santa Monica, Redondo, Long Beach and oth
ers, which were absolutely not in existence
when Grace Greenwood, Nordhoff and other
newspaper people were writing the letters to
the New York Tribune and Herald which con
tributed so greatly to starting the great rush
of people to Southern California.
Take Riverside, for Instance. A great wealth
and population confronts the visitor there. It
probably has the largest per capita of valua
tions of any equal portion of the earth's sur
face dependent on horticulture. When Nord
hoff and Orace Greenwood wrote it had not
even been thoueht of. It stands on lands
which, when they were out here, could prob
ably have been bought for ?1 an acre, and
many acres of which could not now be had for
$3000 an acre. No city In the world under
10.000 Inhabitants has as costly and beautiful
Improvements es this city of the other day.
Its Magnolia avenue is truly a thing of beauty
and a Joy forever. Tt and others of its attrac
tions are of a positively metropolitan charac
ter.
To round out what Is actually a true and
wonderful presentation, take Redland?, a city
not twenty years old, and which looks to have
.VjOO or O00 inhabitants. Its Smiley Heights
Is one of the most enchanting spots In the
world. A city like Springfield. Mass., which
dates away back to Pinchon's time, would look
common and workaday beside It. There are
probably more handsome places In Rerllands
than are to be found In Springfield. Mass., and
Sprlnrfleld. 111., put together â real places of
aristocratic splendor, palatial and modern.
All cf thes* prosperous and beautiful cities
are. so to speak, growing like a "house afire."
Xot only that, but new ones nre springing up
every day. In the neighborhood of Ix>Â» An
geles, for example, the town of Hollywood has
come to the front In a way that Is downright
miraculous and promises another Pasadena.

WHAT SIIAW ItEPORTS.
In response to a question by Arthur
31.. Briggs, manager of the California
i^taie Board of Trade, a member of the
committee to inquire about California
â¢p-heat. Professor Shaw of the Unlver
eity of California made a statement of
Jiis views. Mr. Briggs' question was a
/leading: one and comprehended the es
c.ntial points at issue. Professor Shaw
*?aid in part:
ThÂ« po'.r.t Is this: We are Importing a good
<5Â»al of wheat lor the strength cf the flour.
\Ve might es well produce that wheat here If
v.e can change the characteristics or select
a mat which is demanded for manufacturing
fcurpose*. Without discussing the amount of
that Is produced here, we want a suf-
CciecOy glutinous whtat for our requirements.

a higher gluten content than the varieties now

6EKD INTRODUCTION'.
As to what msy be done In the way of the
t Introduction cf new need, the work of the Iowa
#>$periraent watlcn in inducing the earn farm
Â¦ vtt to uÂ»e l>*-t:er w-Â»d has resulted fn an In
"crcaVed evÂ«Â»rage yield per ncre of not lesÂ« than
three burhe's. which means an increased reve-
Tfje to the State of $12.<XX>,000 ror a single
crcp.
, Ehould we, thrwgh the*e efforts, be able to
, Increase the yield cf wheat but a single bushel
â¢T*rr acre it would mean an increase of over
2.000,000 bushels, with a valuation of Kmi>
*th!rg like 91,r>OO.riOO, to eay nothing of the
Increare In value from the rroductlon of a
wheat of higher gluten ccn^rnt, so much de
rir*d by the miller*, which is the prime ob
ject of these lnvestlirstifr:i>. J
Und*r this head there are two points to be
kept closely In mind, v'z: that the Invest'ga
.tior:s on com rhowÂ»-d that the csr of corn Is
Approximately uniform throughout In chemical
composition of its kernels, and that there is a
wide difference In the chemical composition of
the different ears of the eame variety. These !
facts are tsaentlally Tne same for the campos!
"tion cf individual beets. With this as a basis
for work, the method followed was to deter- ,
mine approximately the* composition of the
rra:n by analyzing Â«. numbfr of the kernels.
rÂ»*erv1rg the remainder of the kernels
facts are e^'ntlally th cam* for the compoBl
from the same *ar for se*<1 purposes If de
rlrrfl. It becomes Impossible then, by the
irs'jrls of a large number of ears, to select
for w*d thoÂ»Â» ears which contain a hlch per
centage cf the <!es!rÂ»d element, plant in an
.Isolated field to avoid cross fertilization and
rrow a crop onder a* cood cultural conditions
as possible. From the seed thus produced an
other campling Is made as before, and those
ears are selected fcr seed which prove highest
In percentage of the constituent It Is desired
to Increase.
Without going into detail as to the methods
employed in selecting the seed and trying out
the several varieties, be it said that this line
cf work would demand the time of a special
person who has had experience in such special
cereallftlc work. For such work It would
either L-e necessary for the university to do a
idrge amount of preliminary experimenting to
overcome the difficulties which arise In such
technical work, or at once to bring from Mln
nÂ»sota or elsewhere a person who has already
been over much of this preliminary ground,
thereby gaining much time.
TWO LINES OF WORK.
It will be noted that there are two lines of
work set forth here which are In themselves
distinct and yet very clcpely connected. When
this matter was first suggested It was only
cor.ten plated to undertake the plan first out
lined, viz: that of selection, as In the case of
corn, en the basis of composition, and breeding
in the desired characteristics in the matter
of higher gluten, and only taking up such
other work as might Incidentally arioe in the
course of this primary investigation. For this
purpose there was asked $1500 only, this to be
distributed as follows: Five hundred dollars,
as soon as it was possible to raise it. to be
used for equipment, and $-50 annually for a
period of four years.
With this a:r.ouQt it would only be possible
to follow out the plan originally in mind. If.
however, it lg thought best to take up this line
of investigation en a still more extended scale,
and In such a manner as California usually
attacks problems and include the work In
cross-fertilizing, a considerably broader finan
cial scale would have to be adopted, and, as
already has been suggested by certain
persons. It might be well to as* the Legisla
ture for epecial assistance in this work which
means go much to our State.
Horace Davis, speaking from the
point of view of the practical flour
miller, who supplied many interesting
facts a few weeks ago, when the wheat
topic was originally taken up by the
California State Board of Trade, gave
additional information in the course
of the discussion before the commit
tee. Among his statements were the
following:
Dry land sowing furnishes the best wheat
for glutinous contents. The wheat depends
upon the moisture in the air and moisture in
the soil together. Moisture In the air thick
ens the bn<n and makes the wheat dark. Tur
key red milling wheat that we have was raised
In Kansas. It is a winter wheat and is a
favorite wheat in Kansas, and we have lm-
I>orted a creat deal of it. It has strong glu
tinous contents to lortlfy our California wheats.
Having imported lu we have distributed more
cr less of it for Feed. I can fully say that
down at Paso Kobles it has been a very suc
cesslul wheat.
One important question about all these
wheats is whether the Ftraw clasps the berry
ttrotigiy enough to keep it from threshing out.
Under the modern system of harvesting, after
it is allowed to get very ripe, wheat often has
to stand for weeks and sometimes for months.
XXiring that time we are always liable to have
those strong northeast wind? that thresh tho
wheat out and throw It on the soils, so that
when the harvester comes along the head is
gathered, but the wheat Is gone. Sometimes
you hear that farmers lose in one year say
cnc-Â«juarter to one-half of the crop. Now they
all tell me teat the club wheat Is desirable
because it cla?ps the head strongly; the sheaf
clasps the berry firmly. That is true in Ore
gon and in this State, too. It Is a matter of
great Importance to have wheat Xhat does not
thresh out.
CHANGES IX PLANTS.
One particular thing â the compoeltion of the
corn plant has bern distinctly changed under
a system of careful scientific experiment. A
great deal can be accomplished by the intro
duction of new seeds. Find cut what seeds
are adapted to this State and to the different
parts cf the State and encourage the use of
them. Mr. Steinbeck tells us that Turkey Red
wheat has been very profitable near Stockton
and that it is In great demand there for seed.
I am told that the Turkey red wheat will
grow on the adobe lands near Storkton. For
one year at least it did not fall back at all.
There r.-as an improvement In gluten, which
Is an important fact â a distinct gain in inform
ation.
Valuable information from experi
ments was imparted by Mr. Steinbeck
of San Joa^uin County. He said that
the Turkey red milling wheat that was
imported from Kansas to be used as
seed in California was tried by Mr.
Mondan, who planted ten acres, sow
ingr SSO pounds. The wheat was good
and about three-quarters developed.
It stood the dry weather and the heat
better than the Australian and club
wheat. The crop was better than the
original s^ed in that it contained more
gluten. The yield was eleven sacks per
acre for eight acres. The wheat was
better than the other wheats from a
milling: point of view. The wheat that
increased in gluten was raised on
heavy adobe land. The neighbors were
anxious to get some of the seed and
were going ahead extensively this
season. There was little difference in
the matter of threshing out between
the Australian and Turkey red wheat.
Mr. McMillan contributed information
based on experiments. He reported that
he had tried many different varieties of
wheat that were a success in Sacra
mento County. From one pound of
Fife seed he received ninety-five
pounds. Last year he received sixty
nine sacks of wheat from the sowing of
one pound. There are six varieties of
this wheat.
A somewhat general discussion oc
curred, in which General Chipman,
Horace Davis and others took part.
Some of the statements made therein
were as follows:
GEXERAL DISCUSSION'.
General Chiprnan â An investigation recently
made suggested the fact that the Liverpool
markets were entirely satisfied with club
wheat as now crown In this State, and that
they wanted It becauee It has a mjperabund
ancÂ« of starch to mix with their â¢ strong
wheats that they get there from other coun
tries and hence we must be very careful In
our advice in future to farmers that we do
rot ask th*m to Jump out of the frying-pan
Into the fire. Now there are one or two ob
fervatlons that I wish to rnaka right here.
In the first place my hope is we will noon be
freÂ«, from the Liverpool market entirely. The
development going en hece in this western
c-nuntry and the expansion of our markets In
the Orient will eliminate Liverpool In a very
few years, it seems to me, and therefore that
argument will not have the weight it would
have If we were confined to the Liverpool
market.
Mr. DavlÂ»â For the laet three years we
should not have bad one pound of wheat to ex
port if we had Bimply depended upon what
thlti State had raised. We use for seed and
feed and export flour 500.000 tons per annum.
We have got to the end of our export.
Mr. Frledlanderâ The wheat that comes In Is
dependent upon it and that makes us depend
ent ujon It.
Mr. Davisâ We are dependent upon the Liv
erpool market because Oregon and Washing
ton are dei>endent upon It.
Mr. Frledlander â The production Is regu
lated by thÂ« price. The reason It has been
cut Is en account of the price. Keep the price
as It Is to-day and tho total production will
be Increased.
General Chlptnanâ It seems relatively the
wheat will have higher prices according to
the greater quantity of gluten. We should
have to bÂ» imoortlnir wheat to mix with It.
Professor Khawâ We do not care to entirely
change its character.
General Chipman â We are endeavoring to
Increase the quantity and Improve the qual
ity to supply the mills.
Mr. Briggsâ This may be done by thÂ« Intro
duction of new s*ed or the developments of
new v&rietles from wheat grown bere.
WORKING TOGETHER,
Before the committee adjourned It
was flgreed that, considering the inter
ests at stake, the California Legisla
ture should be asked to help the farm
ers. Concerning the co-operation that
has taken place in this State much
There were 3C50 acres of wheat sown for
this year's crcu In the county, 6100 acres of
oats. 1780 acres of barley, 850 acres of corn and
37. 1C0 acres of hay.

RETURN'S FROM SONOMA.
At the present time the land will be deeded
from Mr. Entler to this company In the name
of the directors, and they will In turn give
to the Government a deed in trust for the
property.
This course will be taken just as soon as the
money has all been placed on deposit In a
bank and the business will be closed up as
soon as possible.
The object of forming this corporation is that
to all of those who have contributed to the
fund for the purchase of the Entler Tract
may be Issued shares In proportion to the
amounts they subscribed. These shares will
answer as receipts for the amount contributed
and in case tho Government ever relinquishes
the land it will rsvert to the original owners,
the stockholders In the Plant Garden Com
pany. Then any distribution which Is deemed
advisable by the stockholders could be mado
of the land.
The Plant Garden Company is the name of
the new company which will soon file letters
of Incorporation with the Clerk of Butte Coun
ty. This company has been organized by those
who have subscribed to the fund for the sav
ing to Chico n! the Plant Introduction Garden.
This corporation has been orsanl7.ed with a
capita! stock of $S5C0, which amount Is divided
into 17000 shares at $5 each. The committee

of the company and are Messrs. Crew, Koper,
Nichols. Lurk and O'Connor.
A plant garden company has been
organized in Butte County. This is a

On August 3 the Enterprise called the atten
tion of Ihe citizens to the present and pros
pective condition for housing the new settlers.
This Is becoming a serious question; It is not
a theory, but a condition which confronts Chico,
and the business men and people with idle
money or money out at low rates of interest
r-hould acquaint themselves with the conditions
with a view of relieving them.
Last season a large number of families went
elsewhere, fifty in one month, a number of
which wanted to put students into the Normal.
Here we are In August, the dull season and in
school vacation, and no surplus houses. Iteal
estate men cannot supply the demand now â
what will they do in September and October?
One real estate dealer told an Enterprise man
yesterday that he knew four families had left
this week and located elsewhere for the only
reason that houses could not be rented, lie
also said that more of the places offered for
sale could be sold readily if prices were a lit
tle more in accord with real values. Rental
rates are certainly high enough to induce build
ing â or else building material and labor are
beyond all reason. Something is the matter.
and if the business men and men with money
fail to fathom the problem and apply the
remedy the town will be shut up.
It is not best to depend on outside capital
coming to the rescue. Outside money is not
likely to go where home money remains Idle.
Home building organizations could do much to
relieve the ettuation, and outside organizations
will move elowly and cautiously so long as
home people remain indifferent.
Will the experiences of last season be re
peated? If so. it will be a most harmful
thing. Not only houses are needed and will
be needed, but email ranch tracts of land are
getting scarce at prices to induce purchase.
Close-in acreape is going to he in demand for
the small ramher. the small fruit and vege
table raisers and the poultrymen are coming
this wayâ and if they are not located the next
lot of them will not give the place a call.
It is a veritable condition that confronts us
â a business proposition, and ought to be met
In a business way.
The rapid growth of Chico has once
more made a shortage of accommo
dations for the newcomers. The Chico
Enterprise says:

Mr. Brigss â We shall accomplish nothing in
a general discussion. "We should lay down a
platfcrm to serve as a guide that will be of
eome value to us. It will be a difficult mat
ter to get the farmers to contribute anything
or do anything In the way of experiment. In
the first place, whoat farmers are practically
"busted." A large percentaee of them are
renters and would not care to make experi
ments for the landlord or Bomebody else and
derive no benefit themselves. . Lay out plans,
select men in different place* all over the
State who have the financial ability to go on
with the work and can make the. experiments
for their own benefit as well as others in a
very systematic way.
Professor Wlckscn â Co-operation with the
counties at Santa Cruz nnd Monterey has add
ed an equivalent of $2,000,000.
Mr. Brlspsâ What we require Is a man who
has had etiouph experience to go on with It
from a point that hss been gained elsewhere.
Professor Shawâ The matter, particularly of
developing new varieties from cross-fertilizing
requires very close watching ajl the way
through. A green farmer is entirely out of
the question.
Mr. Frledlander â We should endeavor to
mold public opinion so that at the next Legis
lature it will be possible to get an appropria
tion of $6000â $3000 for two yearsâ for the use
of the experimental station, wfth a view to
attacking this problem In Its very broadest
sense.
Professor Ehaw â The millers have been very
active there, but the State alno has made
heavy appropr'atlor.s for experimental work.
The money is appropriated for a epecial line
cf investigation. For instance, for dairying,
which is a special feature: thÂ« money goes for
that particular line of work. One year the
people, making active effort, proposed to ahk
the Legislature to set aside $25,000 fcr tho
special investigation of one production. It ap
pears to me our cereal industry Is as Impor
tant as that.
was said. This part of the proceedings
was in substance as follows:
Professor Shaw â Co-operation is not entirely
new in connection with private enterprises.
The peach growers have, contributed $1000 to
overcome the ravages of the peach moth. Tho
Â¦PPle growers at Watsonvllle requested the
t!Â«slstance of the university to overcome the
effects of the moth, and $4000 was contributed
by the people of Monterey and Santa Cruz
counties. The sum of $3500 for two years was
contributed toward the interests of the as
paragus growers for overcoming rust and an
investigation in their line. The Walnut Grow
ers 1 Association also co-operated extensively.
The importance of the cereal industry la
worthy cf consideration. The question Is how
to obtain the necessary funds for this work
when the university is now carrying * n 'this
behalf all that It possibly can carry from a
financial standpoint.
Mr. FYiedlander â How is the money obtained
in Minnesota? Direct appropriation of the
State?

THE Inquiry recently begun by the State Board of Trade re-
Carding tho steps, to be taken to supply the proper quality
and quantity of milling wheat required for the flour trade Is
so Important a.s to warrant a report in some detail of the pro
ceedings of the committee appointed to conduct the investigation.
The symposium of views given below clearly states the problem be
fore the California wheat rancher and suggests methods by which
seed stock may be Improved. It Is evident that sincere and enthu
siastic co-operation, founded on the broadest scientific lines, will be
required. What action may be taken as a result of the investigation
Is not yet clearly defined, but the Legislature will doubtless be asked
to aid in providing the means for experimental work to solve this
problem of great commercial Importance. Attention Is here called
to what was said at the first meeting of the committee in this city.

The London Engineer, of recent date,
contains some reliable and interesting
information respecting the condition of
the Japanese and Russian warships
after their trying service of the past
six months. The facts are given by
officers in the Far East who were in
the position to know and the deduc
tions drawn from these naval lessons
may be briefly summarized as follows:
The impact of heavy projectiles has a
strong tendency to affect the align
ment of machinery by shock, but less
than might be expected upon bailers.
All small vessels, especially torpedo
craft, wear out quickly and lose in
npeed as the result of hard work, while
the deterioration of big ships is con
siderably less. Cylindrical boilers have
proved inferior to the water-tube va
riety. In the early days of the war the
Russian destroyers were outmatched
by the Japanese, but the hard and al
most incessant use of the latter have
done much to equalize this and the two
flotillas are of about the same effi
ciency.
Regarding the .condition of the
larger Japanese ships before the re
cÂ»nt battle, which proved disastrous to
the Russians, little was known, ex
cept" that the armored cruiser Iwate
was still good for twenty-one knots,
but that the Asama's speed had been
reduced to eighteen knots. Of the
Russian ships the Bayan, Gromoboi,
Rossia and Askold were in good steam
ing condition; the Novik's original
speed of twenty-five knots had dimin
ished to barely twenty knots, and the
Retvlzan was In a sad plight, as her
machinery was thrown out of align
ment when torpedoed. The Cesare
vitch had suffered no damage to the
machinery, while the Pallada and Po
bieda had been repaired and were in
fair shape.
An armored cruiser of a new type Is
on the German naval programme for
the present financial years. The ship
is to be of 10,000 tons and to have a
speed of 22H to 23 knots. The largest
cruisers of that class now in course of
completion are the Roon and York, of
9348 tons and twenty-one knots,
launched in 1903-04.
There are strong probabilities that
the batteries of future battleships will
bo composed of very heavy guns ana
small guns useful to repel torpedo at
tacks, and that intermediary calibers,
such as eight, seven and six jnch, will
be eliminated. The recent target fire
practice has demonstrated that the
heaviest guns were the most accurate.
As battleships are intended chiefly to
fight ships of their own class, the sub
stitution of heavy guns for those of
six-inch would seem to be a rational
improvement. The Georgia class of
six ships, .of 14,948 tons, designed in
1899, are to have four twelve-inch,
eight eight-inch and twelve six-inch
guns, the total weight of which, with
ammunition, is 1417 tons, and the
Connecticut class of five 16,000-ton
ships, designed in 1902-03, are to
carry four twelve-inch, eight eight
inch and twelve seven-inch guns,
weighing, with the secondary battery,
15S5 tons. The increase of 118 tons is
due chiefly to the substitution of
seven-inch for six-inch and additional
weight without compensating advan
tage. The range of these guns varies
of course, considerably. The penetrat
ing power of a shell from the twelve
inch gun at, say 3000 yards, is three
and a half times greater than that of
a shell from the six-inch.
According to ordnance tables a
twelve-inch projectile will penetrate
14.34 inches of Krupp armor at 3000
yards; an eight-inch armor-piercing
shot 6.61 inches; a seven-Inch will
pentrate 6.5 inches and a six-inch shot
will pierce 4.24 inches. The object In
haying the smaller caliber guns was
for these to destroy unprotected or
lightly protected gun positions and to
complete the breach made by the
heavy guns. For such purposes tho
eix-Inch gun appears to be as com
petent as the eight-inch and seven
inch, which weigh considerably. The
weight of four twelve-Inch guns, with
mounts and ammunition, is 475 tons,
which in the Georgia class represent
about 33 per cent and In the Connecti
cut class 30 per cent of the total ord
nance weight. Eight twelve-inch guns
would therefore. weigh 950 tons and
Teave 467 tons and 585 tons weight
to be utilized for the secondary bat
tery and increased protection to the
gun positions.
The August number of the Navy
League Journal contains an interesting
article on the naval academies of Rus
sia and Japan and the system of select
ing and educating naval cadets. The
incidents of the present war have thus
far proved the Japanese system the
best, for no changes have been made
in naval commands of squadron
or ships, while admirals and captains
are shifted about in the Russian fleet.
The Naval Academy at St. Petersburg
was founded about 200 years ago, while
that of Japan, at Etajima, an Island,
dates only from 1870. entrance to the
Russian Naval Academy is open to
boys between the ages of 12 and 14
years who are the sons of naval officers
or of noblemen. About 100 cadets enter
each year, the education of whom is
simply academic during the first three
years. The professional training begins
with the fourth year, and after that
the youngster may pass the examina
tion for promotion to ensign. There
are two weak features in this system,
namely, the initial selection and the
subsequent training, which latter does
jnot tend to establish the pupil's profes
sional fitness until he has spent at least
three years at the academy.
In Japan entrance examinations are
strictly competitive and open to youths
between the ages of 15 and 20 years, ex
cepting, of course, those married or
who have undergone ajiy serious pun
ishment, and bankrupts. The average
number entering is about 200. The
course is three years, with short vaca
tions and monthly, half-yearly and
yearly examinations, at which their
standing is flxed. Professional subjects
are taken up at the start and the ca
dets receive practical training on ships
and steam launches, while even part of
the vacations is given to drills on board
the ships. A cruise of eight months in
a training squadron terminates the
educational course as midshipmen, and
they are then distributed to the vessels
of the regular fleet as junior officers.
The entire cost of maintenance of the
cadets while at the academy is borne
by the Government.
The practical results of the Russian
and Japanese systems of naval educa
tion are being demonstrated. The
theoretical education, very much like
that at Annapolis, together with hard
and constant practical training on
board ships, produces for Japan a class
of officers thoroughly familiar with
their profession. Dash, skill and en
durance are the rule, not the excep
tion, of the Mikado's naval officers,
while the Russians have not, as a class,
given much evidence- of these qualities.
Then, again, the disparity in ages of
officers in important commands in the
two navies, is also an important factor,
for while the average age of five Rus
sian admirals is 57.5 years, two being
60 and the youngest 54 years, the five
Japanese admirals average 49.5 years,
the youngest being 46 and the oldest
54 years. Of five Russian commanders
of battleships, the oldest is 53, and the
youngest 51 years, the average being
52 years, while a coresponding number
of Japanese captains range from 44 to
43 years and their average is only 45.8
years.

When asked as to what condition he at
tributed the shortage, Mr. Cooper stated that
he did not know of any reason exceDt that
th* olive tree was a thrifty producer only
every other yesr and that this year was "an
oft season." The â¢ same conditions. hÂ« said,
prevailed In the Mediterranean district the
recognized home of the olive, and the same
peculiarities of the tree were noticeable In
Southern California. /
The oltve tree, said Mr. Cooper, differs
from most of the other productive trees be
cause It never gets a rest. Ha cited the peach
tree as an Instance to prove the contrary
conditionâ a tree which blooms and produces
its luscious wealth within four or five month*
while It remained In restful barrenness as
to fruit and foliage during the remaining
months of the year. If the olive tree, he
said, could enjoy the benefit of a similar
season of rest, there would be little doubt
as to the regularity of Its productiveness In
both duality and quantity.
Elwood Cooper. Horticultural Cofn
missioner for California, tells Ae
Santa Barbara that
there will be a shortage In the olive
crop of the State thia season.
Mr. Cooper said that the olive crop In
Southern California this year Â¦would be a
comparative failure. The olives were Just be
ginning to set and that It was evident that
the croD on his ranch -would be far below
the averace. Reports from other districts
In th* southern section of the State, he said,
Indicated that this condition was quite gen
eral.

Handball at Olympic Club.
The match game of handball be
tween Joe Condon and Tom Leach of
the Occidental Athletic Club and
Louis Levy and Henry Cory of the.
Olympic Club was won by the latter
at the Olympic Club yesterday after
noon before a bis crowd. Cory and
Levy captured three games straight
and proved superior players. The
Olympic Club men showed team work
and played up to form. Cory's serv
ing 1 and fast drives "from the back
alley were features of the same. Con
don and Leach did not play true to
old-time form. Condon made some
clever "kills" and returns, but there
was no speed to the ball. Leach was
unable to develop speed in his serves
and Levy and Cory were able to drive
the ball at will..
As each side has won they -will play
the final games a tveek from next Sun
day. Atrophy will be awarded the
victors. Scores:

MINNEAPOLIS. Aug. 14.â Rev. O. L.
Morrill. pastor of the People's Church
and local chaplain of the Actors' Alli
ance, announces that he will install a
subway tavern similar to the one mads
famous by the dedication of Bishop
Potter of New York in the entrance of
his new church, which 'Tooze" Rogers,
proprietor of half a Wozen saloons, is
erecting for him. Dr. Morrill said to
day he believed the church saloon idea
was a step in the right direction.
"If people will drink, let them drink
in a righteous cause." he said. "We
will donate the profits to seme worthy
charity." .,, . ,
The entrance to the tavern will be in
the main entry of the church and thea.
ter. which are to be under the same
roof. ;

"I think Monroe is in great form and
I have to congratulate Tim McGrath
on the miner's appearance. In my
opinion Jack has a good chance to
wrest the championship title from Jeff
ries, but at all events it -.vill be a great
battle. I will start to work with Mun
roe at once and expect to have him
working out nicely in a few days."
McCoy expects the stay in California
will do htm a world of good and he v/111
sojourn in the southern part of the
State during the winter. He is inter
ested in a stable of horses and will de
vote much of his time to looking after
the thoroughbreds.
McCoy owns, with Mr. Riggs. a
splendid 90-horse-pfwer De Detrich
automobile, which will arrive in this
city in October. He drove the machine
recently a mile in S9Va seconds on the
Long Island speedway.
The workings of Champion Jeffries'
mind seem past understanding. With
the big fight less than two weeks off
he seems unwilling to undergo the
usual processes of training. He has
hardly had a glove on yet and has
taken none of the work a boxer usual
ly finds so necessary in trueing.up his
eyes and developing his hitting powers.
He may underestimate Munroe's ability
and regret it when too late.
"Yes, I am willing to do some fight
ing here also," said McCoy last night.
"1 would like to sign up with Corbett,
Fitzsimrr.ons err" O'Brien for the light
heavyweight championship of the
world. 1 weigh 160 oounds i.ow, just
five pounds less than I did when I
boxed Joe Choynski in this city seven
years ago. W. B. Riggs will back me
for any amount.
N'orrr.an Selby, more familiarly
known to the sporting fraternity under
the ring name o:' "Kid McCoy," ar
rived from New ifork last nisht and
registered with his wife at the Palace
Hotel. McCoy will remain in this city
for several weeks and will help train
Jack Monroe for his fight with Jeffries.
When the big mill is over the Kid in
tends to go to Los Angeles, where he
will spend the winter.
McCoy has been anxiously awaited
by Munroe and Tim McGrath and it
is expected his presence in this city will
create much interest in the champion
ship fight. It was he who helped con
dition* the miner when- the latter met
Tom Sharkey and Jack has great faith
in the famous middleweight boxer.
Members of the San Francisco Yacht
Club and their guests crowded the club
house at Sausalito yesterday to wit
ness the aquatic snorts. The weather
was delightful, and Ions before the
events commenced standing room was
ai a premium.
Chasing a live duck caused the spec
tators much amusement. Six hardy
swimmers started for the bird, and for
a whi'e the chances of catching it
seemed dubious. After a hard struggle
F. Gailey of the Olympic Club cap
tured the prize. The greaaed pole
proved too slippery for the participants,
as no one reached the end. The pro
gramme was as follows:
One hundred yards swimming, won
by F. Gailey of Olympic Club; fifty

runs scored in the third. Hastines
parsed Nordyke and Lynch singled,

first prize will also figure <in the profit
column.
As though this was not sufficient
pcod fortune, the runner-up. Friendless
Boy, running in the nomination of Sec
retary Peer Tiffany, won second
money, $100.
J. E. H., which is owned by J. E.
Hanley, was a strong one to three
choice over Friendless Boy in the de
ciding course. He Justified the confi
dence of his backers by leading Friend
loss Boy by two lengths to the hare.
The fog then settled down suddenly on
the field like a curtain and shut out
all view of the course from the spec
tators. There were a few breathless
moments of suspense and then Flap
Steward Irvine O'Shea galloped out of
the fog displaying the red flag, which
signaled a victory for J. E. H. In turn
he defeated Pasha Pleasant, Raby Au
rora, and Fancy Free and secured a
bye through the withdrawal of Sacra
mento Boy, which had a three-minute
trial.

The tournament by rounds follows
The surviving teams had anything
but an easy time disposing oJ their op
ponents. In their last match Allen and
Griffin put up a remarkable uphill
fight. When the score stood set all and
5-0, 40-0 against them they did not look
to have a chance. With a little luck
and some good steady playing they
won seven straight games and the set.
Sobey and Hall also had a close call
in their last match. The first set they
took by a 12-10 score and after losing
the second set 6-2, took the third easily.
The other two successful team3 won
their final match in straight sets, but
both matches were close. Gayness and
Brabant were beaten by Long and
Janes, S-6, 9-7. -
Foley and Dunlap won the last tour
nament and stand an excellent chance
to retain the cups.
Hall and Sobey are the only handi
cap men left and if they can play as
well next Sunday as they did yesterday
the scratch men will have their hands
full.
The handicap tennis doubles tourna
ment played on the Golden Gate Park
courts yesterday was the most satis
factory and the most interesting one
held there this year. The poorer teams
were given larger handicaps than t^ual
and the matches were unusually close.
When the handicaps were arranged
many thought the handicapper had
bten too liberal, but the fact that the
two most heavily handicapped teams
reached the semi-finals shows the al
lowances were not too large.
Late in the afternoon when time was
called four teams were still unbeaten.
The teams that reached the semi
finals and will meet next Sunday are
Hall and Sobey^<15). Allen and Griffin
(ewe 15). Long and Janes (owe 3-6) and
Foley and Dunfep (owe 15.)

Although the â¢weather was not the
best for rifle shooting yesterday, quite
a number of marksmen were at Shell
Mound Park. D. B. Faktor headed the
list of competitors by scoring 223 rings
in the Germania Club and following up
the performance with 227 in the Golden
Gate Club re-entry match. He was
closely pressed by C. M. Henderson,
who made 223 and 225. Herman Hubef
in the San Francisco Schuetzea Vereln
was top man of his club, with 225
rings.
In the bullseye competition L. R. Mur
phy of the Shell Mound Club made the
good center of 4V& points, which places
him highest on the list so far fur this
j-ear.
There is some talk of a meeting be
tufce-i the sensational pair before the
racing here will move to the Long Isl
and tracks, but this is highly improb
able in view of the fact that both will
so soon face the starter in the Futurity.
That prize is entirely too valuable to
sacrifice for a decision that neither
accept as conclusive. If either
starts before then it will be a great
surprise to the men who think they
-fcjDow-the intentions of the owners in
t-arested, both of whom will bend their
utr.ojt efforts to have the rival young
'sters fit to race for their lives at Sheeps-
SARATOGA, Aug. 14.â The splendid

Wild pitchâ Corbett. Time of gameâ Two
hours and twenty-five minutes. Umpire â
O'Connell.
After that, the making of run3 was a
simple task for the home talent. Many
of Hughes' passes turned into points
and safe hitting at the ri.^ht time
helped out. Corbett got into several
mean holes, hut fast fielding and heady
pitching came to his re3cue and runs
were thus prevented when they seemed
due to come in. The score:
San Franciscoâ â¢ Seattle â
The game was one of the longest
drawn out of the season and but for
the stars in action would have been
a bad one to view. Frisk ushered In
the second round with a drive to left
field and Corbett threw Blankenships
bunt away over Van Buren's head,
sending Frisk to third. Smith flew to
Gochnauer. but Irwiri hurled the ball
away at the nlate when Hall hit to
him and both runs landed. Wilson then
walked and Van Haltren scored Hall
with a drive to center.
Anderson drew a pass in the second
and Gochnauer f-aerlriced. Leahy
forced â¢â¢Wooden Shoes" and Corber't
drew four. -Waldron followed suit,
making a full house. A passed ball
put Leahy over the jumps with the
first one. With Irwin and Meany on
second and third In the third round,
Gcchnauer unloaded a pretty double
along the right field line and the score
was a tie.
Outside the second inning, Corbett
was absolutely invincible. He had
everything that goes to baffle a bats
man and the Siwashes were utterly
powerless when they faced his curves.
Three times he fanned Wilson when
any kind of a hit meant a run and a
possible victory for Seattle. Frisk
shared the same fate twice.
The man who created the sensa
tion of the day was Joiin Gochnauer,
the latest on the Harris staff. He start
ed by making a one-hand catch of a
line drive from Mohier's bat in the
first innirrg that was as pretty a piece
of fielding as was ever seen on the lot
and when he had a chance to score
runs ho registered two with a weil
placed double.
Ground rules were necessary, as
more than 1000 fans who could not ba
accommodated in the stands or bleach
ers swarmed into left field. It com
menced to get too oppressive there and
bunches of the more agile ones betook
themselves to the top of the fence and
viewed the diamond battle from the
lofty perch.
As usua!, when the banner crowd
turns out, the game was a poor exhi
bition of the national pastime. San
Francisco collapsed in the second in
ning and remained utterly crushed till
the Siwashes had sent three runs in.
After that the home team played much
better baseball, but the wildness of Jay
Hughes really spoiled the game.
The home plate was a mystery to
him. lie walked nine of the opposing
batsmen and it was fortunate more
runs were not accumulated. The Se
attle players fielded in magnificent
form, otherwise San Francisco would
have scored double the number of
tallies.'
Joe Corbett proved decisively yester
day that he is no -baseball gold brick.
Before the largest crowd that ever was
jammed into the Eighth street ballpark,
the former idol of old Baltimore headed
the San Francisco team to victory for
the third time since signing up with
Uncle Harris. "Twas not hitting nor
bad pitching that gave Seattle three
runs, but errors. . Score, San Francisco
6, Seattle 3.
It was a gala day for baseball. "When
time was called 12,600 human beings
had managed to squeeze through the
gates. Thousands were turned away,
for the gates were closed by the police
before the game was calied. The pres
sure against the fences was so great
that the timbers gave way in several
places and hurled the crowds from the
bieachers into the field.

Murch alarm and little fire called
out the Fire Department at about 9:30
last night. A ring from box 114 and
another from box 95 sent the engines
to 949 Market street, where a flre was
under way in the tailor shop of L.
Mink, situated on the second floor
of the building. When the firemen
entered the room they found no per
son present. The fire originated in a
small charcoal stove. The flames
were soon extinguished arid a fireman
was left in charge of the premises.
When L. Mink turns up in the morn

Some of the maneuvers demand that
one Bide shall be uniformed in brown

the militia were In blue. The difficulty
was overcome by the quartermaster's
department coming to the rescue and
agreeing to supply the necessary brown

TWO VIEWS OF THE STATE AND

ATAPCADERO.
Robert Benson Is Cleverly Caught by
Uie Police With a Baited
Suitcase.
Many complaints ha\'e come to the
police of grips stolen from the waiting
rooms and around the ticket offices of
the Ferry building, and yesterday
morning a trap, baited with a suit-case,
caught a thief.
The dummy case was prepared and '
left in a waiting-room, where It could
be found by the man looking for things.
Policemen James McGowan and
Thomas Conlon of the Harbor Police j
station, wearing plain clothes, placed \
themselves where they could not be i
seen by the possible thief.
Presently a young felloK- came saun
tering along through the arcades of
the big building, apparently on a tour
of observation. He strolled into the j
waiting room, looked around and
walked out. But he did not go far
away from the locality. He did not no
tice the two men who were so intently
looking up Market street, but he care
fully noted Sergeant Tom Mohoney,
who was gallantly showing a handsome
blonde lady the way to the Stockton
boat. That officer was too far away
and too busy to be dangerous, so the
young- fellow walked back into the
waitins-room.
He looked at the time-table on the
wall and then picked up the nice new
suit case lying so temptingly in the
corner of the empty apartment. He
moved with a business-like air across
East street and was about to board a
car when the two policemen over
hauled him. Their inquiries as to
where he got the case met with an in
dignant,reply. He insisted that it was
his property. When they opened it and
showed him that it was loaded with
several sticks of wood he weakened !
and confessed that he saw the grip
ownerless and alone in the waiting
room and just took it along. He thought
he might as well have it as any other
stranger. At the. police station, where
he* was charged with petty larceny, he
gave his name as Robert Benson, oc
cupation a Bailor.
Several days ago a young man ner
; vous and hurried came into the Ferry
building, set his suit case down and
stepped to the ticket window. When
he returned the case was gone and
with it his wedding suit, the license
and' the ring that was for a girl across
the bay. After that bridegroom-not-to
be-that-day had recovered a little from
the mighty Jar of his loss he went to
the police station for assistance in the
finding of his lost property and to the
clerk's office for a duplicate license.
When the wedding came off next day
he stood up in his business raiment and
wondered what girl his fine, made-to-'
order suit was hovering around then.
A young lady bound for Santa Cruz
last week lost a dainty suit case while
she was getting her ticket. She re
turned home from her Visit to the city
by-the-sea sooner than she expected,
because in the case was a smart bath

VALISE THIEF TRAPPED
IX FERRY BUILDING
The League of the Cross Cadets will
ctl^hrcte their anniversary by an ex
cursion and outing at Camp Taylor
on Labor day, Septembed 5. Colonel
James E. Power has appointed the
following committee to arrange for
the affair: Captain Frank Grimley,
chairman; Thomas Mahoney, secre
tary; Lieutenant George Thompson,
; treasurer; Captain J. E. McCormick,
Captain P. J. Gallagher. Captain J. F.
Daly, Captain H. J. Leonard. Captain
B. T. Crawford. Captain C. J. Mogan,
Lieutenant Arthur O'Connor.
Cadets Will CeleLrate.
The detectives spared him the pain
of disappointment. Before he could
open the valise they pounced upon
him and brought the old fellow to the
City Prison.
He admitted having taken a num
ber of valises from rooming-houses.
"Only valises," says the kleptomaniac.
"I don't want anything that does not
belong to me. Once I lost a valise
containing 56000. If I can search all
the valises in the world I may find
â¢my money."
Charles Lewis will probably be re
turned to the asylum.
' The method of his capture after the
escape from the asylum was clever.
Valises had been missing from Oak
land and San Francisco lodging
houses for several days. Nothing but
valises were taken. Captain Martin
realized that "poor old Lewis" was at
ttork again and baited a trap for him.
He detailed Detectives Harper and
Armstrong on the case. They took
for bait a valise stuffed with kindling
vood. The monomaniac bit.
' He saw a well filled valise in the
room of a lodging-house. Surely it
looked like the one that contained the
money he lost years ago. His little
fortune was restored, he thought, and
he would never go back to that jail
like house he escaped from.
Because a valise containing $6000
was stolen from him two years ago,
Charles Lewis has devoted his life
since to the stealing of valises. This
failing brought him to the Xapa Asy
lum. He escaped August 5 and re
sumed his life work.
The mania ol" Charles Lewis is a
strange one. He expects at some date
to get back the valise that contained
his little fortune. Hence his peculiar
form of kleptomania. He has no de
sire for anything that does not belong
to him. He merely wants to find the
valise that contained his $6000. His
deranged mind can only comprehend
that at one time he possessed that
turn. It was in a valise when he last
taw it- If he searches all the valises
in the world he might rind it. Lewis
thinks.
The California Commandery of the
Knights Templar, mounted on black
horses, went through their military
maneuvers on the ocean boulevard in
the morning. The knightly horsemen,
four score in number, were drilled by
four score in number, were drilled
by R. S. Hurlbut. -In spite of
the cold the drill attracted
many to the scene and not a little
amusement was afforded by the evi
dent lack of harmony between some
of the riders and their steeds. Un
certain seats are growing more se
cure, however, and by the time of the
conclave every Knight will sit his
horse like one of Uncle Sam's own
cavalry troopers.
Usual Summer Sunday Crowds Not
in Evidence at the Park
and Beach.
An unusually slim crowd was in
evidence yesterday at the park and
beach. The fog-chilled breezes kept^
j most folk indoors. Those who ven
tured forth returned homeward after \
a short stay. The Chutes benefited by
the inclement weather and many con- '
gregated in the theater, where they
I were protected from the cold. !

TOG CHILLED BREEZES
KEEP PEOPLE INDOORS
Lillian Andrews, aa the mother-in
law, Is hilariously funny and gives an
excellent impersonation or the charac
ter. John W. Burton, as the father of
Doubledot's second wife and the hus
band of his first wife, handles his part
well. Edythe Chapman has a light
part, which she makes the most of.
A full house greeted James Neill last [
night at the Grand Opera House in the i
three-act comedy, "The Lottery of j
Love." The piece abounds in humor !
and keeps the audience in laughter i
from the beginning until curtain fall.
Numerous complications in matrimony
and plots to get rid of the burdensome !
mother-in-law form the material of the !
comedy. i
Neill is unusually good in the part of i
Adolphus Doubledot, who is compelled j
to seek a divorce from his first wife on |
account of his mother-in-law's invasion j
of his home. He marries again, only |
to once more meet his old-time mother- !
in-law. The father of his second wife,
while on a vacation, marries Double- 1
dot's first wife and brings her back to '
the son-in-law's home. This mix-up
keeps the audience in a fit of laughter. [
There have been monologtfsts and
monologists at the Orpheum, but
Walter C. Kelly, who introduced him
self to the city last night, is king of
them all. He was crowned by accla
mation and with laughter last night.
Old, blase habitues of the O'Farrell-
Btreet vaudeville shop, who wouldn't
laugh for a salary, doubled up and ha
haed out loud under the laughingitis
spell cast by this wizard of smiles.
You had to giggle, even if the last
notch in your meal ticket was punched
twice and your mother-in-law was due
in the morning.
And all Kelly's humor was real. With
a property table and mallet (he didn't
"knock" in the 1904 sense) he was
judge.bailiff and witnesses in a Southerly
court. So natural was his delivery that
you could almost see the people he im
personated. It was like Judge Mogan's
court on a busy day. All the while
regular Sunday-nighters were tying
themselves into knots with laughter.
Therefore, hail "King" Kelly, mono
logist. Long may he live to hand out
his abundance of heated atmosphere.
There were two jag scenes on the bill,
both of them emphatically realistic.
Ernmet Devoy imitated genteel in
ebriation and Louis Pritzhow did a
steam-beer drink stunt. These imita
tions were so lifelike that a soldier who
had three sheets in the wind had it out
with Harry Orndorf, the stage man
ager: "Shay, ole man, this drunk imi
tashun bishness isn't personal, is it?"
asked the intoxicated boy in blue.
The Original Madcaps displayed the
usual amount of attractive black
stocking and lively girl. The Juggling
Barrets made all the laws of centrifugal
and centripetal motion look like a cook
book of last century. The induced
Panama hats and Indian clubs to do
hops, skips and back flips.
