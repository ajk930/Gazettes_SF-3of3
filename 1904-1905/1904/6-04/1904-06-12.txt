watching a bird that skipped from pop

beeatxse of the masterful way it de
picts the life' cf the Jews both in RuÂ»

Somers, the head of the book depart

be one of the biggest telling books of
the year. ,
It will be published complete in five
installments, and in order to, make its
appearance all the more notable, Mr.
Bert Levy, Just arrived from Aus

illustrate it lavishly from beginning to

the Sunday Call.
Mr. Levy, who is himself a Jew, is
one of the best Jcnown artists in the
Antipodes. For over ten years he
was connected with the Sydney Bul

the able articles from his pen which
accompanied all his drawings. At the

as a .pupil of one of the best scenic

Thus under the. Sunday Call's lib
eral and progressive literary policy of
giving- its readers the very latest high
class' literature by the t>est writers of
the day, there has been secured not
only a- brand nc.w novel, by a writer
who is said to have laid bare the in
ner secrets of his own life in "The
Fugitive," but the art work of a man
equally famous from, another far. dis
tant quarters of the globe, both
brought, together for the first time in
one edition to picture the sorrows
and sufferings, the v ideals and the his

My father did not say a word; he
raised his hand to ' his forehead and
'emitted' a' deep r groan. . A" minute or
.more of silence ensued, during which
! my father looked as if he were strug

dazed, helpless glance at mother, then
'at me." , '
The gendarmes interchanged commu
nicative signs; then one of them said
gruffly: '"Come, you'll have to hurry!"
My father fell on my mother's neck
and wept bitterly, and after pressing
me to His breast and wetting my cheeks
with his tearful kisses, he raised his
hands heavenward and cried: "My en
emies have set a trap for me, but the

robed in a loose white shroud, a fearful
stare in his shrewd blue eyes, his right
hand clutching the girdle around his
loins as he staggered back a step or

looked at the gendarmes In trembling

one of the handsomest girls In our vi

The rest of the day I spent in fearful
thought as to what would become of
me. At about eight In the evening
years my senior and possessed more
self-reliance than I, and he had what
seemed to me an extensive knowledge
of the world. Ha was a ruddy, cheery
boy, tall for his a**, with a large crop
of curly hair and a very prominent
white forehead. In this Institution of
swarthy, sickly. Ill-formed, ill-dressed
doys Ephralm looked exotlo.
When the evening advanced and the
sexton began to put out the lights In
the synagogue Ephralm asked me
where I had my Tuesdays.
I told him.
"You are pretty lucky,** he said
somewhat enviously, with a smack of
his lips. "Only the very best boys in
the class or the gabbal's (president's)
favorites get such 'days' (here he
smacked hla lips again)â meat for din
ner, eggs for supper, and frequently
five copecks extra," He looked wist
ful a few seconds, then he added:
"And where do you get your Wednes-^
days and Thursdays?"
with a large colored handkerchief, all
the while panting audibly.' "And all on
account of . this snot," he burst out
again, with his eyes fixed on me. "You
go there." He pointed' to the 'Other
end of the room. "You belong to the
other class."
Arranging v my disordered clothes,
find sobbing brokenly, I dragged my
self to the other end of the room.
The class to which I was assigned
was known as the Gemoro (Talmud)
section. The Gemoro schoolmaster
took In my tear-stained face with a
single stern glance and ordered me to
a seat opposite him at the foot of the
long table. I ' shivered, as my eyes
caught his. Gorple was a harmless fly
as compared with this instructor. His
name was Shlomka, but he. like his as
sociate, was known by â¢ his habits, so
he was called Gazlen, whose colloquial
significance was murderer.
"Motke!" roared Gazlen, gnashing
hia teeth and clenching his fists. This
exclamation was an admonishment to
one of the twenty-two boys of his class
who had whispered something to his
neighbor.
"Go on!" Shlomka ground his teeth
furiously at one who had been inter
rupted in his recitation.
The poor boy, much confused, could
not find the place where he left off.
"Would that I had waited for your
funeral, Hebcnu-Bhel-Olam (Creator of
the universe)! Why don't you go ahead
with your lesson, you little imp?"
Gazlen's cold gray eyes moved about
wrathfully as the poor little fellow was
endeavoring to find the right place.
Then they came back to the boy, and
he clenched his teeth and seized the
knotty stick that lay handy for use.
"You go on, little devil, or I'll drive
you like a nail into the wallâ aâ get!"
He burst out anew, brandishing the
stick over the boy's head.
The embarrassed pupil searched In
vain for the desired spot; his eyes, I
surmised, were dancing ov.er the page
without seeing a word before him.
"Would that I had waited for your
last breath. Heavenly Father!" And
with this Gazlen gave the student a
box on his ear. The pupil, however,
did not betray a sign of pain; his beau
tiful expressive face grew scarlet, but
a faint smile parted his well-shaped
lips.
Gazlen raised the stick and made as
if to strike the boy. "Ephralm. you
will proceed or 1*11 break this stick on
your head."
One of the pupils. mads an effort to
point the place to the unfortunate
The schoolmaster released his victim
and seized me. My hands were twisted
behind me. I shrieked; I struggled; I
shouted for help; my face went down,
up, and down again;. one button of my
breeches burst, another rolled down In
to my sock; I was overpowered; I felt
my back bare; I protected -with my
handsâ then cut! cut! cut! the thongs
came down upon my bare skin at the
rate of two a second, andâ thank God!
Gorgle was again exhausted. "Now
you'll know. how to mind' your, teach
er!" he panted and released me.
"Take your seats!" he ordered ln>a
tremulous voice, turning upon the
class. "I'll flay the hides off your car
casses, you rascals, villains, you
worthless creatures! Your benefactors
pay their hard-earned money for your
tuition and bread, and In the end, you
leeches, you"â he paused for want of
an appropriate wordâ "you dont care
who pays me to drum God's words In
to your blockheads. He! (This to him
self.) I'll teach them how to behave In
Talmud-Torah." - . . .
> He wiped the perspiration off his face
The schoolmaster placed his recov
ered cap on his head, and without say
ing a word he motioned the boys on
one of the benches to get off it and
move it aside. The miserable culprit
divined his fate and began scratching
his head and crying. Still silent, Gor
gle striked the thongs in water for a
few minutes, all the while casting re
vengeful glances at the whining little
fellow. When he thought the r heavy
straps soft enough, he took the handle
of the thongs between his teeth and
seizing the screeching victim by the
loose part of his tattered breech<?s he
clasped him between his bony knees
and stripped him half-naked, gasping
as he was struggling with his pupil:
"I'll show you how to mock your
teacher!" Then Gorgle threw the
screaming urchin upon the bench, and
motioning to me said: "Hold his feet."
I felt helpless and tears rushed to my
eyes; the: boya looked at me threaten
ingly; I shivered with fear and fin
gered a buttonhole of my coat.
"You hold his feet. I say!" com
manded Gorgle. My reply was a
flood of tears. -
"Will you do what I tell you orâ"
He made a threatening gesture.
I did not budge and my tears flowed
faster. â¢ .
an ox. and several more whistled In
chorus and stamped their feet while
Gorgle's head was moving about under
Â¦the table in search of his wedding
present. ' ' â¢ ' .1
One of those who sat farthest away
from the instructor,- taking advantage
of a moment when the schoolmaster's
back was turned, put his thumb to the
point of his snub nose, and spreading
his fingers in the shape of a turkey's
tail made big eyes at me. This wel
come caught the notice of the class,
and all Joined In a sniffling, mocking
chuckle.
"Who started -this laughter?", thun
dered the stoop-shouldered, red-beard
ed schoolmaster, turning around
quickly. He looked with fierce inquiry
into each poverty-stamped face.
A sudden hush fell Upon the pupils.
"Who- started this giggling, I ask
you?" repeated Gorgle, picking up the
leather thongs that lay at his elbow.
The silence became even more in
tense.
"Who laughed first, I demand of
you?" he shouted with more vehe
mence. >
The little wretches turned pale and
trembled with fright. A long-drawn
snore broke the dreadful silence. AH
faces turned in the direction of the
slumberer. The snub-nosed boy who
had made fun of me a little while be
fore sat with his head thrown back,
the visor of his torn cap dangling
loosely alongside his right ear, his
hands resting on the table before him,
and snored as naturally as if he were
dreaming of Jacob's ladder.
The teacher descended *( upon the of
fender and furiously swung the pliant
thongs about the head, face, and bands
of the little Jester. When he had so
exhausted himself that he could flog:
no longer, he threw the thongs upon
the table and collapsed in his chair,
ghastly pale and out of breath.
His stormy eyes lighted upon me.
"Why are you standing there like a
clay dummy'"
Terrified by his fierce voice, I quickly
sat down upon the edge of a long
bench. My tears once more nearly
overflowed.
Notwithstanding the severity of Gor
gle's punishment, the snub-nosed Jester
was not yet subdued. As I sank trem
bling upon the bench he looked at me
and bleated like a young sheep. The
class, having recovered from its fright,
again roared with laughter. The
schoolmaster turned white; a cloud
seemed to overspread his . hollowed
cheeks and furrowed' forehead. Like
an enraged cat he started for the wag,
but as he raised the thongs his velvet
skull-cap, which (as I was afterward
Informed) had been given to him as a
wedding-present a score of years be
fore, slipped off his head and fell to
the, floor. Another laugh broke out at
sight of the glossy pate of the master,
which was exposed In all Its fullness as
he stooped to recover the cap. As he
arose the greasy head-gear dropped
from his nervous hand, and the laugh
ter grew more uproarious. "Snub- .
nose" bleated again, another pupil
mewed like a cat, another lowed like
"Silence! Silence!" Gorgle shouted,
aroused by the general din, and rolled
his eyes -threateningly.
For an Instant my attention left the
teacher and fastened upon the boys
around the nearest table, who were
showing a peculiar interest in me.
Some were rolling their eyes and pro
jecting lips, others were- thirustinr out
their tongues, and still others were
twisting their faces into ail sorts of
wry designs.
"Find one!" ordered Gorgle, stretch
ing his neck awkwardly and rolling his
bulging eyes with Impatience.
The youngster hesitated, and his
searching eyes and fingers wandered
over the book before him. Finally he
pointed at the similitude of a goose
standing on one leg.
"And what do you call the one like a
worm with little wings?" ; ". ,
"An aleph," returned the boy.
I did not leave my place by the. door
where he had left me.. I was naturally
very shy, and the appearance of this
schoolmaster filled me with foreboding.
So, fearing to move. I stood nervously
against the wall, waiting till I was told
to take a seat.
"Zalmen,. what do you call the letter
with a head and neck of a goose stand
ing on one leg?" asked the teacher,
continuing with the lesson which our
entry had Interrupted. His name was
Oetzel, but he was better known as
Oorgle on aooount of his habit of con
stantly craning- his "gorgle," which is
Yiddish for larynx.
**A lamed (Hebrew "I"),** the boy
nearest him answered in a small pip
ing, tremulous voice.
I remained standing gloomily Just
within the door while the beadle carried
on a whispered conversation with one
of the teachers, who all the time was
blinking his watery-blue eyes and
stretching bis neck, like a goose after
taking a mouthful of water. The room
in which I found myself was high and
spacious, but was most slovenly kept.
At each end stood two tallow-smeared
tables placed at right angles, and upon
crippled benches beside these sat boys
of all ages and sizes, their heads cov
ered. Dog-eared prayer-books and
tattered Bibles were promiscuously
scattered over the dirty floor. Coal
drawn caricatures and sketches dis
figured the once whitewashed walls,
now brown from age where not black
from charcoal; and wheels of spider
webs slightly oscillated around the cor
ners. The odor of mildew was almost
suffocating.
His talk with the teacher ended, the
beadle turned to me. "This will be
your school, Isroelchickle," he saFd
kindly; and then he bade me be good
and departed, leaving me to begin my
new Ufa.
The beadle had a quick step, and I
toddled along as fast as I could. At
the sight of the ancient-looking,
weather-worn, red-bi^ck synagogue,
with a rickety outside staircase that
led to the women's chapel, my heart
began to throb with premonitory fear,
for I knew that the womtn's chapel wag
also the Talmud-Torah. We pushed
our way through scores of ragged,
barefoot boys who were rolling in the
sandy yard below the sfalrs, and
struggled up the Btairway through
dozens of other little wretches who
laughed and shouted as they wrestled,
fought and played pranks upon each
other.
and a charitable house foT the poor was
commonly designated as the hekdesh
(sanctuary). So when "Jacob the bea
dle" came up to me a few days after
my mother's death and told me to go
with him to the Talmud-Torah. I un
derstood without a moment's hesitation
that I was going to be enrolled, not in
a theological seminary, as the name
might Indicate, but in the school for the
poor.
All our money and valuables had g one
to "grease the officials' paws," so at
my father's death we were literally
pennlles*. With the exception of our
Jarp.; house, which was heavily lncum
bcrcd, every possible means to main
tain our previous comfortable style of
living was exhausted. It is true, the
community wax kind enough to offer
her eorne assistance, but she cried
many days thereafter, and said she
would rather siarve than become an ob
ject of charity. Bo she bought a cow
and ecld iuÂ« milk, and In order to make
both ends meet from time to time my
mother sold pieces of furniture from
cur home.
Thus autumn and winter passed and
sprint? came again. I was kept in a
private school, at the cost of how
much relf-dcnial on the part of my
mother I did not then unuerstand.
Uuv.ever. I noticed that my mother
grew weaker and weaker during this
time, and at length the took to her
bed.' Then there came an evening
which is as memorable to me as the
evening on which my father was torn
av.-ay from us. The sun had already
dipped into- the forest that encircled the
town; the stroke of the sexton's mallet
had Just soundedâ the signal for "Eun-
Kt rervice"; and the shades were be
ginning to fall. I stood by the window
looking out into our bit of a garden;
from behind me there came frequently
the coughs and groans of my mother. J
"Yisroelke. my child." sounded the
feeble voice of my mother.
I turned and hurried to her bed.
There was scarcely a tinge of blood In
her emaciated cheeks; her dim eyes
were overrun with tears. I wondered
why she ehed tears; our neighbors had
been so good to usâ had brought us
every morning boiled chicken, fresh
milk and flowers, and the beautiful
boxes and vials that stood on the
window-sillâ and yet ?he wept!
"Kiss me, my darling."' she whis
pered.
I kissed her hand first, then rising on
tiptoe I prcrsrd my lips to her chin,
which wan moist from her weeping.
"I may soon go away." she said with
an effort, "and you will be left alone â
alone." Her spasmodic cough checked
her words.
I could not clearly see how she could
go away when 6he was scarcely strong
enough to move about.
"Here, my child." she resumed pain
fully a moment later, handing me our
Old Testament, dog-eared and yellow
with age, "keep this always with you.
This is all I can leave you. When you
pet older, my child, you will read it;
und when despair comes to you, you
will also read it and gain courage. This
is a!l your father had when he started
in life; this Is all you can leave to
your children, and this Is all they will
lfave to their offspring, to the end of
the race."
A peculiar look spread aver my
mother's countenance as she epoko
these enigmatic words; a magic luster
Beemed to brighten her dim eyÂ«.
After resting a little while she con
tinued more easily, as if the. words she
had Just spoken had greatly relieved
her. "Yisroelke. if you ever meet your
brother"â there was a painful pause â
"remind him of this book. Let him
read these pages. He will learn that
there is nothing to be ashamed of in his
linkage, and will come back to our
fold."
Early the next morning I was wak
cnod by sobbing and walling. I raised
my head and glanced at my mother's
bed. It was empty. I dressed in haste
and hurried to the dining-room. In the
middle of the floor lay a figure, cov
ered with my mother's quilt. Two flar
ing candles stuck In our.silver candle
sticks stood at one end of It. Sitting
on the floor around the figure were sev
eral women, who constantly raised
their voices in lamentation: a number
of elderly women were measuring long :
strips of linen and 6titching them to
gether; and a score of boys chanted
psalms In a monotonous minor key.
I looked bewllderingly about the
room. Then affected rather by the gen
eral prief than by any definite realiza
tion of its cause, I burst Into tears and
wept bitterly.
At first no one tried to console me.
but wh^n the women had finished the
white garment an old man came up to
me and said: "Stop crying. Isroel
chlckle (this was his version of my
name), and come outside."
Outside there was also a crowd of
people. A little man moved through
the crowd crying "Zdokol Zdoko!" at
the highest pitch of his cracked mez
zo-soprano voice, at the same time
shaking a tin can that contained a few
rattling coppers. "Zdoko! Zdoko!" he
shrieked persistently: and the by
standers, as he passed them, dropped
coins of small value into the contribu
tion box that he shook beneath their
faces.
In response to a cry at the door,
those who stood nearest the porch
crowded back, and the figure I had
seen lying on the floor was carried out.
But as the pall-bearers were going to
lift the bier, one of the elders of the
community raised his hand to com
mand attention, and said in a grave
tone. "Rabaci (my superiors), now is
the time to do something for the
orphan."
All eyes were turned upon me. I
tried to control myself, but the tears
continued to flow against my will.
"To the best of my knowledge," the
venerable man continued, "the boy has
no relatives In whose care we can place
him. It is Incumbent upon the commu
nity to do all it can for him. until he Is
old enough to provide for himself. As
there Is not a penny left by his mother
I sugsest that the orphan be right now
supplied with 'days.' At my house he ',
will have Fridays and Saturdays."
Within a few minutes Sundays, Mon- i
days, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and i
Thursdays had been offered, and they ;
were one week.
The pall-bearers lifted their burden
and the procession started. A long :
train of men and women followed the j
bier with bowed heads, and a great
number of boys chanted mournfully: :
"Righteousness walks before her." Be
fore now I had vaguely understood on
what Journey my mother had gone, but t
now I realized that she had gone never i
to return, and that I was left all alone j
In the world. ; ,
CHAPTER~in.
THE SCHOOL. FOR THE POOR.
My people were very Ingenious in
naming things; they would rarely per- '
mtt themselves to call a spade a spade. :
For Instance, the custom of poor boys
getting certain meals regularly In cer- '
tain well-to-do homes was called "eat- '
Ing days;" an invitation of a poor man i
to dine with his rich co-religionist on ]
the holy Sabbath was dlsgulsedly en- !
titled "plat" (a corruption of "billet"); I
the graveyard was, perhaps cynically, '
epeken of as th* "house of the living"; '
After prayers loot of the boys ran
home, and those who had no homes
went to their "days," but Ephralm
and I remained In the synagogue. He
told me of his sordid childhood and no
less miserable youth; he also was an
orphan without kith or kin. Tet de
spite his present misery he did not
complain; he even spoke Jestingly of
Shlomka's blows. He was about three

synagogue below for prayers. TbÂ«
boys ru down the stairs peU-mell,
pushing and klckinr one another, pull
ing tbo ears of the passersby, and
Deemed perfectly happy In their misery.
When prayers were over -I recited the
Kaddish (a prayer for the dead), which
reminded me of my mother, and again
the tears began to com*. I can now
hear my ringing: vole* la the echoing

stick had fallen with such energy In
the morning.
.THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
2â¢7 I ran ; toward; the marketplaceâ a
targe o'pen square which the fire could
not reach. The streets were filled with
frantic people. Men were groaning
and shouting; women were wringing
their hands and weeping bitterly; chil
dren, holding oh to their * mother's
skirts, cried and* screamed; cattle
roamed about, lowing and bellowing.
Mothers rushed with their children in
their arms; men staggered . under the
heavy loads, which they carried to
At the terrifying cry, followed by the
tolling of the sonorous fire bell, I seized
the' Old Testament which my mother
had left me, stowed it safely in my in
side coat pocket, and rushed in fright
out of the Talmud-Torah. A vast
volume of smoke swept over the school
yard. Before I was half-way to the
original fire a score of houses were
burning, and in an incredibly short
time half the town was In flames.
self from the hair-splitting reasoning
for and against the parties to this
action. . '
Suddenly wild shrieks reached my
ears: "Fire! Fire!"
Nothing is more terrifying to Lithu
anians than flre. To these poverty
stricken inhabitants it means ab
solute destitution. Few have their
property insured; most of them have
nothing to Insure but their decayed
"four corners," as . they call their
hovels, for wnJch they can scarcely
spare the premium.
Every Lithuanian town Is visited at
least every twenty years by a destruc
tive fire which literally wipes it out of
existence, so- that these disasters have
become distinct epochs of each town's
history. The Lithuanian calandar
dates back to the first fire, the second,
or the third.
Hill" was the most prominent. I ran
diagonally across the fields, now laid
waste by hundreds of trampling feet
and by household goods scattered upon
them, and I climbed to the top of
"Bloody Hill." 1 seated myself upon a
huge rock which crowned the hill, and
looked down upon my burning birth
place. The sky was clouded with heavy
curtains of black smoke that overhung
the whole region, and myriads of
sparks and cinders flying around In
this floating vault tinged It with
burnished gold and crimson and dotted
its zenith with constellatlonlike groups.
All the people about me were weeping
â poor mothers who foresaw starvation
for the babies in their arms; marriage
able maidens whose dowries were now
gone- and who were doomed to spln
sterhood; fathers who had always
been penned in the "pale" by Russian
barbarity and-could not clearly see by
what miracle they would be able to
rebuild their "four corners." I joined
in the general grief. | More than all of
them I had occasion to j mourn; for
those poor people had friends and kin
dred to console one another. But
whom' had I? The Talmud-Torah
burned down, my beneractors and
"day" givers ruinedâ whither could I
turn? I had no friend, no kindred, as
If I were born of the rock I sat upon.
My head fell between both my hands,
and I wept until I could weep no
more. In my fancy I compared this
flre to that which reduced the Holy
City to ashes, and like a little Jere
miah I sat by the ruins of my town
and 'bewailed the loss of my people.
A few hours later the whole town,
with the exception of a few houses In
the outskirts, was transformed to an
expanse of glowing ashes. Here and
The following morning, when Shlom
ka came to school, he found on the wall
a coal-drawn cartoon of himself in the
act of spanking a pupil.
The class was silent from fear, but
satisfaction could be read in their
countenances.. The teacher glanced at
the wall and then looked threateningly
at his pupils. He was puzzled as to'
who was the perpetrator of this atro-
Another summer and another winter
glided by, with the same monotonous
"day eating," sleeping on the comforta
ble Dutch oven, receiving of occasional
raps from Shlomka's stick, diving in
the Talmudic ocean, and soaring high,
high into the spheres whither Isaiah.
Ezekiel and King David transported
me. Although my physical being was
confined within the narrow walls of
the dirty Talmud-Torah, my fancy
took flight to Mount Lebanon, Mount
Moriah, to the realm of Judea, and
sometimes descended to the Valley of
Sharon, where I plucked the sweetest
of roses. In our leisure hours Ephraim
and I would read the "Menoras-Ha
moer," a book abounding In legends
and mystic tales, and other cabalistic
books that told of devils and flying
angels and seraphs.
The following summer Ephraim de
cided to leave the Talmud-Torah and
go to some other town.
"Listen, Shrolke," be said to me one
summer evening. "I am already a big
boy, and I can read a page of Talmud
without any assistance. Why should I
etay here when I can go to any town
and get 'days' and see the world?"
His words filled me with dismay. But
I sympathized with his desire to leave
this place, so I agreed that his plan
was a good one.
"But before I leave I must take re
venge on Shlomka." :
I hated the idea of vengeance. Be
sides, Shlomka was our teacher, and I
thought he had a right to beat us. I
begged Ephraim not to do any harm to
the schoolmaster.
"Oh, you are like a girlâ always
afraid of everybody," he answered al
most contemptuously. "Why did he
pull your ears yesterday? Couldn't he
tell you to sit down without slapping
your face first?" -
I was silenced.
Another^ sleepy voice is heard. "Zc
mach, give me one bite â a bite â a
little bite. Hold it between your hands
and see if I don't take a little bite." I
hear the boy jclck the bench; perhaps
because he cannot get a "bite." I hear
several voices at once "Hit himâ hit
him, you pig's snout!" "I'll knock the
stuffing out of you!" "I only had one
slice of bread .and onion!" "Abll (one
of the Talmudlc authorities) says it
must be divided in halves!" "Ha! ha!
ha! Catch him â catch him â ha!" (he
rolled oft the bench)! And so I lie and
think until I decide to pull the blanket
over my head and wander away also
to dreamland. .
they looked Jlke blue cords, and his
face began to work ominously. We ex
pected to see him fall upon this revo
lutionist and rend him.
But Ephraim was undaunted. "I am
not your wife or any erf these little
cowards," he went on. "If you raise
your hand on me I'll break your fat
nose."
Shlomka made a move for the stick,
which waa trembling in Ephraim's
hand. Cut he instantly reversed his
apparent decision and sat down, shak
ing his finger at his pupil. "I'll not soil
my hands cm you, you rascal," Shlom
ka Gazlen said, panting and quivering.
"The gaboim (officers) of the Talmud- _
Torah'will settle my account with
you."
Without saying a word, Ephraim
broke Shlomka's stick on his knee and
left the class.
He did not return until after evening
service, when h^ came up to me and
said in a whisper 1 : "I am not done with
him yet. To-morrow is my last day
here, and I'll leave him a token of
frlendÂ»Jiip."
On summer afternoons at about 3
o'clock Shlomka and Gorgle would
grant their classes a recess /of about
half an hour, during which Shlomka
would take a nap with his arms folded
upon the table and Gorgle would' go
home to feed his goat. The next day
Ephraim did not appear at school un
til this recess period. The boys were
all out in the yard, and Shlomka was
peacefully snoring, his beard spread
out on the cracked, worm-eaten table.
"Hold this," Ephraim. said to me in
apparent haste, pulling a candle from
his pocket-
I could not divine what was In his
mind, but I did as he bade me.
He lighted the candle In my hand, and
said: "Come, quick." ' ,.
I hesitated.
,."Oh, you coward! Come!" he ordered
angrily. Â¦
I followed with a leaping heart to
where Shlomka sat asleep.. Ephraim
produced a piece of sealing-wax,
melted it, and sealed Shlomka's beard
to the table.
"To the 'Bloody Hill,' " he whispered
as he ran out of the Talmud-Torah.
The picture of the teacher^awakenlng
and trying to raise his sealed beard
from the table I leave to. the reader's
Imagination.
At about the time Shlomka was pro
bably arousing from his nap two boys
stood on the "high hill" which.over
towered my birthplace, clasped in each
other's arms. The taller one smiled
humorously, his face bright with the
satisfaction of- victory; the eyes of the
smaller were filled with tears.'
"We'll soon meet ! again," said the
taller of the two hopefully, as he took
up bis little bundle.
"We'll soon meet again," echoed the
smaller one weakly; and he watched
the disappearing form of his only

winter, with Its hoary frosts and long
nights, arrived. The winter school
hours were from nine In the morning
till ten at night. Fragmentary scenes
of the school arise in my mind. I see
tne schoolroom, isometimes overheated
and sometimes shivering cold, but al
ways close and reeking, with its lamps
suspended on long wires from the ceil

ice and snow so It is scarcely possible
to look through them, the floor thick
with dirt, which keeps on accumulat
ing and scarcely ever feeling
the stroke of a broom: fifty or
more boys cudgeling their brains over
their obselete studies, with their torn
caps, through which their hair pro
trudes, and with torn boots, through
which toes peep out, and which have
been mended so often that there Is al
most nothing left to patch upon; and
I see them munching crusts of bread,
â¢which they receive from the institution
on the days when they have no "days,"
and saying parrollike grace after swal

there, had been a few bites more. And
then I see the school at night. It is
rnidni^lit. Outside, the winds are
howling and chasing the drifting snow.
I hear the grewsome noise in the flue.
I am stretched on the warm Dutch
oven, with Ephraim by my side, snor

.the narrow benches . which stand
against the walls of the Talmud-Torah,

Ephraim was proud of me, and the
other boys hated me the more.

â¢was made more so by my devotion to~

over his thoulders, his dark bearded
face and wandering eyes lifted heaven

eloquence and foretelling the doom of

the ruins of the holy city and bewailing

Then misfortune fell again, and I was
again thrown out upon the world.
It was on the first day of the Jewish
month of Allul, toward the end of the
summer. It was a half-holiday and all
the boys were out. I sat alone in the
classroom before a big folio of the Tal

on a case In which "the defendant's ox

As I ha\*e previously intimated I was
In those early days of a very diffident
disposition. The boys at school dis
liked me for my reserve, mistaking my
melancholy shyness for pride. If it
h&d not been for Ephraim, the only
friend I had, the boys would have pil

probably have resorted to physical tor

was the biggest and strongest of the
boys, eÂ» naturally his word was law to
them.
the erstwhile noisy synagogueâ gloomy,
awe-Inspiring. The ner-tomid (the
perpetual light) is glimmering before
the oren-kodesh (ark), casting its great
shadow upon the wall. To my left is
the large schoolroom, in which a small
light is burning; the shadows of the
suspended, slightly oscillating lamps
appear like so many colossal spiders on
the walls. 'What a babel of voices!
Some of the children on the benches
snore and groan and unconsciously
make broken complaint against the
world. There is a sudden shrieking
and screeching. I know whose voice It

call hlny he Is a little, hammered

Suddenly he stops; the snoring of the

They beheld me approaching themâ

neck, the four fringes of my arba
kanfas dangling: about me, ha tier.?.
coatless, my breeches tattered and
patched, my boots so mended that the
patches needed patches â ragged, hun
gry, exhausted. They beheld all this,
yet they saw but one thingâ the Jew.
"This is a Sjid (a slanderous name for
Jew)." I heard one remark.
I was immediately surrounded by the
peasant boys, among whom I stood
half-paralyzed with fear. They were
dressed In unbleached linen shirts and
in trousers of the same material. Their
feet were bare, and their flaxen heir
hung around their shoulders Ilk*
fringes of raw hemp.
"Certainly, a Sjid." said the biggest of
them. "Can't you see his black
breeches?"
After a long walk, which almost ex
hausted meâ for I had had nothing to
eat since' the previous morningâ I
faintly heard hilarious shouts. I
turned into the direction from which
the voices came, and soon found my
self nearing the edge of the forest.
Now the cries sounded very distinctly.
"Tu-ha! tu-ha! tu-ha!" and I knew I
was approaching a group of swine
herd's. My heart began to throb fret
fully. I crept forward cautiously and
peered from behind a bush. There wero
five of them, lying on their stomachs in
the grass, with several lean and
shaggy dogs stretched beside them. As
I watched them they took up their
pipes, made of willow bark, and In turn
played their peasant melodies â sweet,
eloquent, wild, yet how,, simple! One
could read In their rustic airs their
people's history, their character, their
manners, their hopes and aspirations.
As they played they knocked their
heels together as if beating time to
their music, and their dogs, as If 1b a
kind of ectaay, rolled their tails and^
leaped about restlessly/ opening and
snapping their jaws, or barked at
nothing In particular.
Envy filled my heart. I wished I. too,
were a swineherd rolling over deep
grass in the shade of trees and piping"
melodies. I wished I had never been
born a Jew, but a gentile like these
boys. "Is it not enough to\bear tha
burden of man, that I must In addition
bear the burden of the Jew?" I said to
myself bitterly.
Despite the innocent happiness of
these boys I feared them as possible
enemies. I was going to slip away un
observed, when I happened to think of
Ephraim. "He is right â I am a cow
ard," I said to myself. This reproach
ful thought lent courage to my nerves,
and I stepped into the open and walked
toward the swineherds.
But soon the disaster of the preced
ing day flashed through my mind. I
realized anew that I was a friendless
wanderer. Again I asKed myself.
Whither should I go? My native town
was no more, and what did I know of
the rest of the world? I thought of
Ephraimâ but where tvas he? At
length I arose, washed my face In a
little brook near by, dried it with my
arba-kanfas, and started through the
forest, giving myself blindly over to

flames. How small my birthplace
lookedâ like a private graveyard!
I. But misfortunes never come singly,
they say. It was not enough that we
had lost our homes by fire; as dark
ness began to settle about our misery,
soft rolls of thunder were heard. Soon
drops of rain began to fall, and blind
mg flashes of lightning ripped across
the black sky. In another minute
the sky seemed to break open, and it
rained as though another deluge had
come upon us. What little had been
saved from the fire was ruined by
water. The people about me covered
their heads with pails, pans or boards,
or sought shelter under tables and bed
ding they had saved. But I was so
utterly despairing that I was Indiffer
ent to the downpour. Drawing myself
together, I let the rain wash me clean.
CHAPTER VI.
A NIGHT IN A FOREST.
After a* time the rain ceased, the
clouds broke and the stars began to
appear one by one, slowly, as if they
shrank from looking down upon the
misery below. ' I arose, but I was so
stiff and numb that I could hardly
. stretch a limb. I b^gan to walk, pain
fully at first, without the least knowl
edge where my. feet were taking me.
darkness about me added gloom
to my despair. I now felt more than
ever that I was an orphan â a lonely
child in the great egotistic world.
Now and then, however, a star twin
kled hope to me, and not infrequently
a shrill cricket, leaping in the wet
grass, seemed to offer me courage.
Presently I found myself in the skirts
of a forest; it was dense and deep â a
genuine . Russian forest. I recalled a
..little open space a few hundred yards
within this forest, which had been my
- fayorite resort on pleasant Sabbath
afternoons. I had always loved the
mighty solitude of the forest; there
seemed to be a certain kinship to my
weary melancholy. But now I re
mained standing with trembling fear.
The moaning of the flre victims still
rang in my ears; all the horrible stories
of. beasts and robbers I had heard in
my childhood haunted my brain. The
least noise made my flesh creep. I ad
vanced . a step and stopped again. A
wind swayed the boughs of a sapling
and emitted something like a sigh, as
if it were pitying the poor orphan
standing near it. Then silence again.
The large forest slept; all nature
rested. I held my breath. I put my
feet down softly and took the path
that led to my favorite retreat. The
clear moon, peeping through the thick
foliage, escorted me step by step. On
my way I annoyed a number of birds
in their nests in bushes; their flutter
of wings and twitter were perhaps
complaints against me, but I also com
plained and nobody heeded my grum
bling.
At last I reached my favorite spot,
and being utterly fatigued I stretched
myself upon the long soft grass and
forgot all my troubles in dreamland.
I found myself on the peak of a
high mountain, very high, almost
reaching the clouds, with a staff, bud-,
ding leaves and blossoming. In one
hand, and in the other I had a musty
looking little book, like the one my
mother had left me. Enchanting mef
odies reached my cars. I glanced
down. At the foot of the height I
stood upon there ran a broad stream,
in which people rode about In small
barges; and across" the flowing water
stood a magnificent structure, the
lower part of which resembled our
synagogue and the upper looked like
an ancient Grecian temple. A num
ber of people stood in the doorway of
this singular edifice and motioned to
me to drop my burdens â the staff and
the little bookâ for they became heavy,
yet they were dear to me, so I hesi
tated. The multitude below renewed!
their invitation, and the longer I hesi
tated the more demonstrative became
the crowd. They began to threaten
me that unless I drop my staff and
book and come down willingly they
would pull me down. But their
threats gave me courage and lent
warmth to my blood. Then the vocif
erous throng began climbing the slope
of the mountain, yet I did not budge;
I feared them not. They soon reached
me and showered crushing blows upon
me, but I did not care; I did not even
attempt to return a blow. The staff
and the book now became precious to
me, and I pressed them to my breast
with all my might. Hard as they
pulled at the leaves of the book, they
could not tear a leaf. The only, In
jury it sustained was a little dirt from
my perspiring hands in clasping -it
tightly. Then a hundred hands seized
me and began pulling me'down, but I
suddenly felt my strength becoming
herculean and I forced them all back,
remaining in my lofty position and
laughing them all to scorn.
In another instant the sun appeared
resplendently. My bleeding wounds,
which the mob had inflicted upon me.
began to heal, and the blood in my
veins now coursed warmer and swifter.
I* was feeling young again. I erected
my stooped shoulders, straightened my
bowed head, washed my bespattered
face. Suddenly the crowd below reap
peared; again the flowing stream at
the foot of the mountain; again the
curious structure; but now the crowd
below sent friendly greetings to me.
' Without hesitation I flung the staff
and the book aside and began to de
scend the precipitous slope, when I
lost my balance and rolled down, down,
down, untilâ I woke.
I sat down In the soft, moist grass
and sleepily glanced about me. The
day was just breaking. A gauzellke
bluish mist hung over the forest, and
the moisture of the night dripped, tip.
tip, tip, from bough to bough, from leaf
to leaf. Here and there pearl-like
beads of dew, hanging on grass-blades,
- twinkled like diamond studs in green
fleece. From the heart of the woods
there echoed early morning sounds â
the horn of a distant shepherd; the
faint lowing of a cow, the bleating of
a sheep, the lash of a whip like, a ring
ing pistol-shot. Silence for a moment.
I languidly rested on my elbow. A
rustle above my head drew my eyes
thither; a canary-finch skipped around
restlessly, gently swinging the boughs
of a tree. Then she began to sing.
First her crisp sweet notes came in
short warbles, but soon, as if heated by
her own enthusiasm, her song swelled
to a thrilling string, of purling, quiver
ing melodies. "Tchlâtchiâtchiâtchl
ruckâtchiruckâtchlâtchlâtchi," an
other forest singer struck in; then fol
lowed the notes of the cuckoo, the bob
olink, the chaffinch, as well *aa the
chirping and whistling and humming
and buzzing of all other birds and flying
and creeping Insects that help awaken

trying to save hia family and his own

to put out the flames. The conflagra
tion soared higher and higher; flicker
ing streaks flashed from every" side;
broad blazes swept right and left, de
vouring as they went the straw
thatched log houses."
I reached the marketplace. It was
already crowded with heaps of furni
ture and other household goods, on top
of -which their owners sat on guard.
By this time all the nouse3 in town
were ablaze, and a violent wind fanned
the flre into embracing sheets of flame.
Burning wisps of straw from the
thatched roofs, and firebrands driven
by the fierce wind, flew in the air me
teorllke. The heavy timbers of the
well-constructed houses fell with roars
into the flaring debris beneath. Here
and there a man tried to save his home
by throwing on it pails of water, but
all in vain. The town was doomed.
So, shielding my face with my cap
from the. scorching heat, I ran toward
'the outskirts of the town.
The town was surrounded with a
chain of hills, among which "Bloody

"We want a clean flag," Is the cry
to-day from thousands of patriotic
voices In the "United States of Amer
ica. The imperative demand comes not
only from the National Association of
the Sons and Daughters of the Ameri
can Revolution, the Grand Army of the
Republic, the Loyal Legion of the
United States and- the American Flag
Association, whose fifty-six, different or
ganizations co-ordinate all the patriotic
societies of the country, but from erery
soldier who has followed the sacred
symbol in our battles for freedom, from
every schoolhouse where the act of sa
luting the flag is taught and required
from our millions of children as a deed
of reverence second only to that of
honoring the name of God, and from
every home In our mighty land whose
peace and protection are secure be
cause of what that flag represents.
Our Star-Spangled Banner, our Old
Glory, is desecrated by the spirit of
commercialism of the present age, and
"as it catches the gleam of the morn
ing's first beam" it has ceased to re
flect the "full glory" of the magnificent
sentiment by which it was conceived,
born, baptized and flung aloft. In
Honolulu and Manilaâ our new posses
sionsâour flag is permanently nailed
up on the front of liquor saloons and
brothels; two brewing companies in the
State of New Jersey print across its
folds the words, "Stands for the best
beer," and a pharmacist .in Milwaukee
sprinkles among Its stars In great
white letters, "Magic headache wafers."
Recently a scavenger in Boston sew
ed a flag on the outside of a burlap
bag in which he gathered coals from
ash barrels .and went through the
streets carrying It upon his back. He
was arrested at the Instance of one
cf the flag committees, taken before
a magistrate and fined twenty dollars.
He was a Russian who would not have
dared commit such an outrage In his
own country, but ours is "the land of
the free" and freedom in itâ especially
on the part of some foreign-born citi
zens â Is sometimes construed into lit
cense.
General Grant admitted that it was
a new question to him and he did not
know whether there was a law on the
subject. Like him, very many of our
best citizens are ignorant of even the
necessity for such a law. Immersed in
other matters the indignities heaped
upon our beloved flag have escaped
their notice, but again thousands of
others' have watched with anxious
hearts the increase of this Irreverence
for what they hold most dear.
For five or six years the American
Flag Association has been engaged in
obtaining State legislation relative to'
this matter and nineteen States have
enacted laws to prevent further dis
honoring of our flag, but when an ef
fort to suppress the use of a flag brand
upon canned goods was made in the
local courts of Chicago, the Judge ruled
that the act came under the Jurisdic
tion of Congress Instead of a State and
should be decided by national legisla
tion. As yet there has been none.
It remained for a San Francisco citl
rcen, W. H. Murray, a member of
George H. Thomas Post No. 2, to make
a direct personal effort to obtain it
and thereby forever erase this blot
upon our national honor. Senators
George A. Perkins, Quay. Hanna and
Caldwell of Ohio (the latter being the
first to introduce the flag bill in Con
gress) were all persistently inter
viewed by him and caught his enthu
siasm. Traveling over the United
States he made a special feature of
enlisting sympathy with this righteous
causa. The officers of Faneuil Hall,
Boston; those of Independence Hall,
Philadelphia; the Betsey Ross Me
morial Association, the Francis Scott
Key societies, all were visited and
aroused to new activity. A document,
known as bill 229, was drafted, altered
dozens of times to make It very com
prehenslv* and finally "perfected" (as
reported by Senator Quarles) by the
Daughters Â«f the American Revolu
tion, who have strenuously endeavored
to bring It to the attention of the pa
triotic people of the country. North
and South.
March 11, 1904, a bill prohibiting
the desecration of the American flag
â¢passed the Senate, but not the House
â¢f Representatives. We will hope
that the crowded condition of affairs
at that period of the Fifty-eighth Con
gress was the cause of the apparent
oversight. Hhe act contains five- divi
sions, that of No. i imposing a heavy
penalty upon "any person, persona,
corporation or company using the flag
or coat of arms of the United States
for any advertisement, trademark, la
bel. Inscription, etc." which the genii
of this artlstio (?) age can Invent.
At the next Congress the bill will
have to be introduced again. Let us
hope that California will lead the pa
triotic van In protest against such an
Important matter being longer de
ferred. Were resolutions to that effect
passed as soon as possible by each
Grand Army post, each woman's club
and each parlor of the Native Sons
and Daughters of California alone, be
fore another Flag day the matter
would be accomplished.
OUR DESECRATED FLAG
By Nellie Blessing Eyster
And so life passed till fall had come
again. Again the sky was constantly
overcast with heavy dark clouds that
dripped cold drops; again drizzly
showers dismally washed the window
panes; again heaps of withered leaves

flower-stalks stood like gravestones

One gloomy afternoon, while the
sudya was in the courtroom adminis
tering Justice to peasants, Katia and I
sat in her father's study reading to
gether and engaging in such chat as
made me at the same time Jealous and
happy. We were on a couch near a
window. Katia sat with one foot under
her and the other hanging down, her
lesson-book in her lap. We ceased
talking for a minute or two, while we
gazed at the rain, which was becom
ing mixed with melting snow.

My tears rushed to my ayes. Will I go

circle, a member of her family.

words. She looktd greatly surprised at

"Israel," sh* Implored, attempting to
remove my hands, "why do you cry*
What did I say that hurt you?" And
she clung to my hands, removing finger

"Listen, Katia," I blurted out pas
sionately. "I shall study day and night
until I become a great manâ as great a
man as you like; and thenâ thenâ ah,
then"â I became conscious of what I
was about to say and dropped my head
in despair.
"Oh, you foolish Israel." she said,
raising my head by thÂ» chin, "then I'll
marry you."
How candidly and naively she ut
tered these words 1 Without the faint
est blush, without tht least excitement,
with the simplest understanding of
what she said.
Impulsively, without being fully con
scious of what I was doing, I threw my
arm around her neck and kissed her on
the mouth again and again.
"Katia! Katia!"
It waa Judge Blalnlck's voice that
called me to my senses; it sounded
stern and harshâ almost cruel.
I raised my eyes frightfully and be
held Katia's father standing In the
doorway, with a relentless expression
on his countenance. Â¦*
"Katia!" he called again; and he
stood cold and erect until Katia, with
downcast eyes, walked past him into
the adjoining room. Then he also
turned around and walked out, leaving
me alone with my head drooped over
my chest, and tearaâ large, boiling
tearsâ burning my cheeks as they
rolled down and dropped upon my shirt
and vest.
Continued Next Sunday.
I did not swerve from my purpose to
become a great man, and pored over
my books arduously. My instructor
was highly pleased with my pr&sress.
I could see his face beaming v.ith gen
uine delight as I recked m7 lessons.
"'â¢Excellent," "splendid," "very good."
he would remark, pacing up and down
the room as I was reading a composi
tion or reciting a page of Cicero. Only
half.a year before Katia had been far
ahead* of me in composition, but now I
was reading the masterpieces of Rus
sian literature, while she still used a
Khrestomatlaâ a book of selections.
Mr. Kremlin told me that if I- would
study assiduously till the following
summer I could easily talce the exami
nations of the fourth and perhaps of
the fifthâ he referred to gymnasium
grades. Of course I wished to go to the
gymnasium and there study harder
and harder, that I might become a
great man like Nekrasoff or Pushkin
or Lermontoff andâ marry Katia.
And Katia would listen to Mr. Krem
lin's praises of me without the least
Jealousy. When the teacher was gone
she would put her hand on my shoulder
in her childish way and. looking into
my eyes, would say: "Israel, you will
go to the gymnasium the coming year
and take away all the prizes. I am
sure you will get a gold medal on
graduation. My cousin Mishka got
one, and he is not half as bright as you.
Oh, what a great man you will be
some 'day! Your picture will be In the
Novocti and in the Svlet and in the
Novi Vremla, and you will be so proud,
with your head erectâ you will not
want to talk to me." Here I shut her
mouth with the palm of my hand.
"You mean you will be proud," I
would retort enviously, with no little
rancor in my heart, "and go away to
your relatives in Moscow or Kleff and
mix with colonels and generals, and
you will be ashamed to talk to me."
I really meant every word I said, be
cause Judge Bialnick talked of being
promoted or installed either In Kieff or
Moscow, where moat of his near rela
tives lived. . \t.'.
THE END OF HAPPINESS.

come Into my room to ask after my
health. My appearance interrupted her
from flinging it back, and faintly color-
Ing she remained standing with hand
uplifted.
"Good morning, my good little fel
'low," the sudya said, turning his ner
vous soft gray eyes upon me. "I hope
you are feeling better now," and he
smiled graciously.
I faltered some words of thanks.
The girl, standing with the ball in her
hand. looked at me with curiosity. My
eyes met hers and my embarrassment
increased.
"Come nearer," and the sudya
pointed at a chair by his side. "What
"Israel Abramowitch."
The judge's long, blonde-bearded face
grew slightly pale, and he turned It
from me Just a trifle. "Yesâ so you
told me before."
"Who is your father?" he asked
after a short silence.
"I have no father."
"Your mother?*'
"I have none."
"Where Is your home?"
"My home burned down."
"Where do you come from?"
I mentioned my native place.
Again he was silent for so long a
time that I thought he was displeased
with me. But when he spoke his voice
reassured me.
"I lived in your town for some time â
perhaps you.do Jiot remember me. I
was sledevatel. I must have known all
your people. Who was your father?"
un "Yudel 'Abramowitch." .
The sudya leaned back in his chair
and for a few seconds covered his eyes
and high forehead, which action I
thought was by way of straining his
memory to recall my father; and clear
ing his throat he said: "Yes, I remem
ber your father well. Erâ he used to
come to my house quite often and I
also called at his a number of times."
Pride filled my heart. This illus
trious personage in my father's house!
The Judge again passed his hand over
his eyes and forehead, and throwing
one leg over the other and nibbling at
his long, pink finger-nails he added:
"That's right. Your father died eight
or nine years ago. What has become
of your mother?"
Again tears rushed to my eyes. "My
mother died," I responded lugubrious
ly; but Just then my eyes fell upon the
girl, who was still regarding me with
absorbed Interest, and with a throb
bing heart I added: "Yes. she died in
misery and poverty, and as I had no
relatives or friends to take care of me
I was sent to a charity school and pro
cured my meals every day In a differ-'
ent family."
He asked some more questions
about the fire and my escape. Then he
resumed absent-mindedly: "Where. do
you expect to go from here?"
"Why, I'll go to a Jewish community"
and resume my 'day eating* and study
the Talmud;" and I added gloomily:
"I have no other place to go to." â¢
The little girl came up to her father
and slipped her arms around his neck;
her blonde curls fell sof tljf about his
shoulders. I thought I detected tears
in her eyes.
After my last answer the Judge
seemed to be lost in thought. I stood
with bowed head waiting for him to
speak again.
"How would you like to stay in this
house, Israel?" he asked after a while.
"You will have the same teacher. who
gives instructions to my Katia. Isn't
Feodor Maximo witch a good teacher,
gclubtchlck?" His daughter answered
by tightening her arms. ''You will be
clothed and taken "care of as my own
child until you grow old enough to
choose for yourself." -tfÂ«N-'<
Could I remain in the house of a gol,
even though he offered me all these
things and asked nothing In return? I
hesitated. Instantly the Talmud-Torah
appeared before my Imagination, and -I
recalled the tattered clothes which I
had hitherto worn, the humiliating
system of "day eating," the grim pov
erty of the people about me. In con
trast there was the kind gentleman
who now spoke to me as If I were his
equal. the beautiful house and. the
richly furnished rooms, fine clothes and
the best of food, a teacher to instruct
me in Russian literature and perhaps
even French â which I then Imagined to
be the language of angels. ( Raising my
eyes I found Katia's gaze fixed at me
as if she were asking me to accept her
father's offer. Could I do anything but
stay?

When I fully recovered, autumn,
Russian autumn, had .fairly set in.
Zamok, as my benefactor's estate was
called, stood Isolated from the rest of
the world by vast stretches of Bnow
covered plains, like a single ship on
the ocean. The nearest village was
three-quarters of a mile away, and the
nearest town, which had no more than
four hundred inhabitants; was a dis
tance of about >twenty miles. Had it
not been for the peasants and Jews
who came to attend trials or settle
their disputes before the sudya (for his
Sometimes I would ' tremble at the
thought that I was gradually drifting
away from Judaism. What would my
mother have said to this* At the
thought of her I would shudder for
shame; and often I decided to steal
away at night and never come back.
But Katia! Katia, with those long,
blonde curls, which she began to wear
In a braid this springâ with those smil
ing, sparkling eyesâ with those tender,
teasing waysâ Katial j How could I go
and leave her behind me? I knew that
she was a shigselke (a little gentile
residence was also his courthouse),
Zamok would have been as secluded
and unfrequented as an undiscovered
island. Mr. Bialnick seemed to be
averse to society, and appeared to en-
Joy nothing except his child's company.
My teacher accounted for the Judge's
excessive melancholy by his grief for
his wife, who had died about a year
and a half before. However, I did not
feel lonesome. For besides Katiaâ with
.whom I would not have felt lonesome
had we been the only beings on a de
serted Islandâ there was Feodor Maxl
mowltch Kremlin, our teacher; Olga
Ossipovna Shtchedrin. Katia's gover
ness; Vlnitzki, the courfr clerk; and a
number of good Jolly servants.
Katia had come to be like a loving
younger sister to me.* The kindness,
the simplicity, the sympathy of this
mere child of 13 awoke all that was
best in me â my emotions, imagination,
energy, ambition. "Whether in the
house or out, throwing snowballs or
skating, I had to be at her side. The
first few months she would sometimes,
though -innocently, make fun /of my
pronunciation, which lacked the sono
rous Russian ring. She would slap and
scold me and' mock my talk, and all
this gave me delight. Both of us
seemed' to feel that her
father would not have us too Intimate;
and so in her father's presence she
gave no signs of the friendship which
existed between us, and I likewise as
sumed a distant manner.
That spring my feelings budded and
blossomed. I did not stop, to analyze
my new sensations. I was merely
aware that my imagination, my
thoughts, 'my every-day existence was
brighter, and that my blood ran warm
er and faster. All nature seemed to
share In my gladness; the birds seemed
to have more cheerful notes, and the
fields,, the meadows, the forest, the
very blades of grass never before woro
such a green as they, put on that
spring. Scarcely a year from "day eat

orphan, but I was so happy when she

leaning on my arm as we read one of
KrilloflVs fables; but otherwise he
showed me almost paternal affection.
There was a benign expression on his
face, and his soft gray eyes seemed to
have smiles concealed in them, despite
the depressing gloom that always hov
ered over him. He smiled very oftenâ
he very rarely laughed; but what sad
ness in his smile!
â¢That spring I also noticed that the
delicate. Bkln of his fair cheeks waa be
coming marred here and there by fine
lines, and that his j nose waa turning
purple. And one time, as I found him
standing by the sideboard with a de
canter of rum in his hand. I staxted
to turn back, but he noticed me, and
replacing the decanter he stammered
confusedly: "You may stay here, Is
rael." On another occasion I found
him reclining unconscious in his large
arm-chair and the same decanter of
rum on a little round table at his el
bow. At first, fright seized me. I
thought he was dead. But I soon dis
covered differently. He waa drunk. I
locked the door and, moving on tiptoe,
adjusted him comfortably without
arousing him. I shivered lest Katia,
who- had gone with her, governess to
visit a neighboring hamlet, should find
her father In this state. Leaving the
door locked on the inside, I crept out
through a wfndow.
During the summer Katia took a va
cation from her books, but I studied
even more assiduously than before. My
ambition was rising every day. Katia
had once told me, when we were chat
ting all alone In the garden in the rear
of the house, that she would marry no
one but a great manâ as great as Ne
krasoff or Pushln or Lermontoff. I re
member distinctly that I felt dizzy for
a while after she had said this, and
that, in spite of my repeated efforts to
Bpeak, my words remained stuck In my
throat. However, when a little' later
she told me I was to be a great poet
like Lermontoff, I felt my blood rush
ing to my face and a peculiar thrill
shot through alf my frame. I sat oppo-
site her and gazed and gazed into her
translucent eyes, frank in their childish
innocence. Then I was seized with the
consciousness of my own insisnifleanc?.
and I felt so hopelessly untalented that
I abruptly ran away to my room and
locked the door.

I declared piteously that I had only a

pive them for a piece of bread.
"Cigarettes or money!" all exclaimed.
Several struck me with the butts of
their whips, and I heard their whole
vocabulary of vituperation against my
race.
"Let me go!" I begged of them. feel-

The biggest of them tore off my arba

to the ground, and the others laid their
whips over my body and face. "Give
us money or cigarettes!" they shouted.
I put my hand In my pocket to pull
out my last few coppers. But they were
gone. I muet have lost them In the
woods.
They thought I was trying to deceive
them and went through my pockets
themselves. On finding nothing the
biggest on* struck me In the Jaw with
his fist and said: "Give us cigarettes,
anyhow, you Christ-killer!"
I could make no answer. My sight
grew dimmer and dimmer and my
head whirled. The last I remember of
that incident are sharp cuts of whips,
furious dogs Jumping upon me, tearing
at my already torn clothes, and the
shrieking and whistling and laughing
of the swineherds.
CHAPTER VH.
I FALL AMONG GENTILES.
I was tn a stupor, half -waking, half
dozlng. when my ear caught the sound
of a voice. I wished to open my eyes,
but I felt so fatigued and rested so
pleasantly that I did not care to open
them, as we often feel on a cool morn
ing when thÂ« alarm-clock strikes to
waken us. The faint sound became
clearer and clearer â It seemed to me
that the owner of the voice was draw
ing nearer to me until I could hear dis
tinctly words.
"He Is stirring."
This was not In a peasant's dialect,
but In pure Russian, which I was not
accustomed to hear.
"Sh â eh!" another voice cautioned.
I opened my eyes, turning them one
way, then another, and stared about
me In amazement. "I must be dream
ing," I said to myself Incredulously, as
I glanced at the fine bed on which I
lay and at the soft pillows and snow
white sheets, the like of which I had
rubbed my eyes again and surveyed
the room. It was spacious, with large
windows on two 'sides, and its walls
were hung with paintings and etchings.
'â¢How did I come here?" I asked my
self. I recalled my adventure with the
swineherds, and I realized, though
half-consdously, that a long period had
intervened between that incident and
the present, but I could not remember
anything that took place during the
lapse.
"How do you feel?" was asked of me
in a soft feminine voice.
I only smiled in reply. I could not
understand the meaning of all this; it
recurred to my mind that perhaps I
was dreaming, after all.
I said something In Yiddish, my
mother tongue, but the people about
me 6eemed not to understand It. Then
a sickly looking woman asked me in
Russian whether I wished for any
thing.
"I should like to know what hap
pened to me and where I am. I re
sponded In the peasant's dialect.
She smoothed my forehead and said
gently: "Lie stilL The doctor says you
must have rest."
I closed my eyes again. Gradually
my memory strengthened, and I began
to trace back step by step to the time
when I lost consciousness. I had a dim
recollection of being taken In a car
riage, of giving my name, and having
suffered great pain, but the rest was a
mist.
A few days later -I was strong enough
to sit up in bed propped up with pil
lows. How I had come here was now
clear to me, thanks to the information
of my good nurse.
Morovoyi Sudya (Justice of the
Peace) Alexis Bialnick, . the owner of
the big forest in which I spent the
night after the fire, found me lying In
the outskirts of the woods, half-naked
and unconscious. Finding his own ef
forts to revive me of no avail he or
dered me to be taken to his home. As
feeble as I was I had a strong Inclina
tion to rise and leave the house. My
benefactor was a gentile, his food was
trief ' (rltually unclean), and I feared
lest he should force me to baptism In
compensation for his kindness. I had
heard of such crafty proselytlsm, and
besides, ivho had ever heard of a gen
tile showing disinterested kindness to
a Jew? I remembered the warning
written by my grandfather on the fly
leaf of the Testament my mother had
left me. that we should shun gentile
favors, because they would be Invaria
bly followed by loss or injury.
However, these prejudices weakened
the longer I stayed in the house of the
sudya. He appeared to ma like an
angel coming to my rescue; and who
could tell but that he was Elijah met
amorphosed to the form of a boy (gen
tile)? My brain, always full of super
stitions and trusting in miracles, easily
credited the thought, and for a moment
I he!d my breath.
One morning, after I had become
able to move about the room, I was
asked to etep into the Eudya's study.

The panorama of restless, wind driven

Dorothea, so runs the story, is the
motherless daughter of one Colonel
Sandring, \tjt by that world crusted in
dividual of little heart to be reared
from infancy by two God-fearing
maiden aunts. Dorothea lives, for
twenty-one years in this rarefied at
mosphere of piety and ideal purity of
thought, knowing naught of the world
or of the world's ways, nursing within
her girl's heart a philosophy of cold
asceticism, dogmatic as it is unyielding.
Then when her father suddenly takes
her out into the whirl of society, of
"high society," drops her into Paris
and at Monte Carlo, introduces her to
his circle of easy living, free thinking
friends, comes the demonstration o"
Dorothea's 'iron Sabbatarianism. Sur

is alone to blame for her husband's

Yes, here is another of the good old
"romantic novels," so styled, which
kept everybody up nights some five or
six years ago, which were dramatized,
plagiarized, satirized, harried and
tumbled until the book world was a
bristling wilderness of pike staves,
swords and daggers. And still Mr.
Stephens, who was then in his heyday
with his "Enemies to the King" and his
"Road to Paris," keeps a fond eye on
the scarlet robed vogue of the past and
delivers himself of another child of the
same spawn. "The Bright Face of

of "Rulers of Kings," "The Boss," "The

stories whirring with the Jangle and
rattle of the. hard, materialistic present,

the past is as out of place as a Lon

in the magic of his name or great
trust In fortune that he should produce
such a gay sweet willlam in the modern
literary garden of garish sunflowers

Henri de Launay, a youth of some
what bloodless and bookish tempera
ment, is taken In hand by the author
at a tender age and made the hero of
ndventures such as a Prince Rupert
never dreamed. At the outset his fair
lady taunts him with his studiousness
and distaste for the life strenuous such
as it was lived In the France of Henri
Quatre. Stung Into a fine fury, young
Henri de Launay makes a vow, assez
simple, that he will show the_jajjr one
the stuff in him by going to Paris, and
removing from a very truculent 9pung
brave residing there his , mustaches.
.This laudable purpose eet for him. the
bookish man starts out, kills a
man in a duel within ten leagues of
home and goes to the rescue of a fair
unknown that he surmises to be in dis
tress. She is, of course. She is mewed
up in a grim, gray castle by a count of
tne most unlovely disposition. The
hero therefore proceeds to get her out,
that proceeding occupying the full
measure of the story.
"As I could not get the dagger out of
the other man's shoulder joint in time,
I drew my sword. â¢ â¢ â¢ Wild with
horror at the prospect of their meeting
so hideous a death, I sprang into the
air and ran my sword straight into the
panting mouth of Garoche, so that the
point came out at the back of his neck.
â¢ â¢ â¢ I wiped my weapons on the
clothes of the slain murderersl The
Countess fell on her knees and
thanked heaven for our preservation."
Thus runs this rarely wondrous tale of
the bookish young man, who wades up
to the top of his Jack boots in floods of
red and white corpuscles.' And he does
not get the mustaches, but wins the
Countess, a mere substantial reward
of valor," we take It ]

To Cicero's conception of the wofth
of old age to self, to the family and
the state Wagner adds an especially
beautiful thought: that old age must
act as the fining fire for youth not only
In affairs of the world, but in mutual
intercourse, the one with the other.
"So when the old-time trying of
conclusion between age and youth la
renewed in the family circle," says
the author, "when the seething young
wills rise against the institutions and
customs of other days, there is no need
of trembling for the future. This is
Just as it ought to be, always on con
dition that this Juvenile exuberance
finds its check. For. left entirely to
Itself, its work would ba only confus

ment of life and progress, provided it
be restrained, tempered and guided
by the wisdom of age."
"Heart of My Heart," 'Ellis Mere
dith's book, is indeed unique in the
records of fiction â so unique that
there may be some who will scoff;
but, have they any eou!s, they will re
main to ponder, at least, If not to
pray. The author seeks to trace the
metamorphosis which comes to a
woman's soul with the knowledge that
of her body there is to be born a man.
With a sureness of touch and a deli
cacy of sentiment Ellis Meredith re
veals all thÂ« store of mother love that
grows with each Â»pulsing of the life
nascent, every high hope and fond re
solve builded about the mystery of
conception. The story Is instinct with
purity of ideal and exaltation of
thought.

"By the Fireside" Includes twenty
two essays, serene and encouraging,
essays which have, all of them, to do
with those little commonplaces of
home and home life that may seem
Insignificant in their several essences,
but which, combined, make for the
broadness and the perfection of all
that the \true home represents. Ven
eration for the paternal rooftree and
a full accord to the instinct of a per
manent abiding place for every man
are two of the cardinal lessons Wag
ner would teach. A family spirit of
unity and of respect for this, at once
the least and the greatest unit of all
government, makes a nation builded
firmly on the rock of the ideal in the
author's mind. There is a "religion
for the fireside."

The latest volume In the Baker &
Taylor Co.'s "Stories of the Churches"
i3 the history of the Congregational
ist3 by Leonard W. Bacon. Well qual
ified for his subject, as his noteworthy
"History cf American Christianity"
attests, the Rev. Mr Bacon has pro
duced a book notably free from sectar
ian rancor and broadly tolerant. The
subject presents peculiar difficulties,
because so many churches that are
truly congregational are outside of the
denomination which calls itself the
Congregational Church. Mr. Bacon
succeeds admirably in tracing tha his
tory of the Congregational principle
and of Congregational bodies. Ths
schism between evangelical and Unitar
ian Congregationalism is fairly related,
the later history of Unltarianlsm sum
marized without acerbity, and the mis
sionary achievements of the Congrega
tional body are warmly appreciated
though they might have been more ad
equately set forth.

main events of our country's develop

Elson sÂ«t himself the task skillfully
to cpllt the difference between those
many voluraed histories made for peo

than the average, and the other ex
treme of books which condense chrono

many years later became a member or
his first Cabinet." And this Is the last
Eentence touch* he puts upon his pic
ture of the writer of the Declaration
of Independence: "This vast being,
the Public, has discovered his strength,
and it was Thomas Jefferson above all
men who awakened him' to Relf-ccm
sclousness." This is Lincoln, the love
of whom reveals Itself in every line the
writer put on paper: "Apparently con
fiding with his friends, his inmost soul
was fathomless and was veiled from
every eye. Awkward and ungainly in
appearance, there was something so
deeply impressive In h!s face that none
who ever saw him could forget it."
One of the advantages of getting hold
cf a hi6tory done by a man with some
literary art is that it encourages busy
people to reread what they have learned
long ago but half forgotten, and now to
see them again in the light of other
eyes than those which saw and repro
duced them for us in the yon of
younger days often gives back the
forgotten with fresh revealed features
to the whole face of affairs. This is
one of those kind of books; it's not
wholly for the new-come foreigner
finding out the past nature of the big
beast which is going to try to assimi
late him, nor altogether for the adoles
cent American who is learning for
the first time ' of the misdeeds and
heroic successes of his ancestors. Elson
calls our attention to some things
which we should not forget, but which
he says the masses of the people have
almost forgotten; for instance, al
though the word Saratoga still rings
resoundingly in the popular ear, yet
not so the name of Philip Schuyler,
who is the hero with which that battle
sound, should mingle as we cheer It
down the ages. Technically speaking,
some one else won the victory, but
historic research shows that Schuyler
made the thing happen; and the name
of the othdr man Is less worthy of
the laurel of our recollections.
Good indeed, and intensely Interest
ing, are the things he. has selected to
tell us so graphically about the main
movements and the foremost men of
the Civil War. So fair has he tried to
be In his descriptions that it would
seem that the veterans alike of the
North and the South might read of
how the struggle looks to a recent
historian without one angry pulse
beat In their heroic hearts against an
unrestrained and ungenerous pre
judice which must perforce be born in
the blood of every American for gen
erations to come. Such generous re
straint does Elson show, although he
admits that he must probably have
some of the natural prejudice of a
man Northern born. Bo generous in
deed, that when he tells us of the hour
when Southern resistance had surged
to the highest point it had the power
reach, the charge of Plckett's brigade
up the heights to Cemetery Ridge, he
swells the heart responsive to relation
of heroic deeds almost as If there were
something Southern in him which
spoke spontaneously and made him ap
propriate to his own soul the glory of
that flower of the Confederate army as
If he felt It were not merely sectional
and Southern, but American and man.
As for Elson'a slips Into perhaps un
conscious prejudice, consider this sen
tence carefully, and with the mouth
prepared to smile, for it sounds more
like a Joke than a prejudice: "I have
refrained from using the term 'rebel'
â¢ â¢ â¢ to designate those who rose in
rebellion against the Government, be
cause of my profound respect for their
sincerity." No doubt Elson is sincere,
and yet the sentence sounds as who
should say: "I am too courteous a fel
low-dtlzen, and too impartial a his
torian to call them 'rebels,' but, con
demn them, they were rebels, who rose
In rebellion, all the same, although,
out of courtesy, I don't say It In good
set terms." Perhaps Mr. Elson meant
the sentence for a bon mot; but at all
events so unprejudiced is he in other
ways that even a Southern man might
smilingly "let that pass," saying, he
la a fairly good fellow anyway, take
him for all in all.

the author for writing 1 something that

delivers herself of some very pleasant
and very homely advice upon guarding

THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL'.
A GLANCE AT THE BOOKSHELVES
5I ran my canoe close In and sprang
upon the bank before they saw me.
It was growing dark, what with the
Â¦tonn and the lateness of the hour.
Miss Milwood turned and gave a glad
cry.
"Oh; Jack!" she said piteously. "I'm
so glad. We've been- unable to get
home! Our canoe was beaten back
by the storm and it upset and we were
thrown into the water, and it was a
mercy It was near the shore, else we'd
have drowned!"
"How did you escape?" I asked
stiffly.
â¢â¢We â we waded! And I'm chilling
to death. Jack!" Her lips were blue
with cold and she shivered miserably.
Poor Blakeslee was in no better
plight. ;
I hastened to right the other canoe.
with Blakeslee's help. Then I put the
luckless boatman aboard, paddled
him across to the mainland and bade
him sprint for the hotel and get a
roaring fire ready. I then recrossed
the river, lifted the terrified girl into
the large canoe, tied the other behind
and set out in the teeth of the storm.
Doggedly and steadily, keeping as
much as possible in the lea of the
shore we crept down the angry sheet
of water. Mis3 Milwood. strangely
ouiet, huddled in the bottom of the
canoe and said not a word. But I
could hear her teeth chattering and I
felt love and pity struggling hard with
my new resolution to be grimly firm
and uncompromising.
My muscles were aching and my
heart throbbing as though It would

shelter of the boathouse. I fastened

"I beg you won't mention it, Miss
Milwood." I said with exaggerated
politeness." It was a mean thing to
sayâ I realized it at the time; but it
was necessary if I was to crush the
fierce longing to take her in my arms.
I hurrifed her up to the hotel. * rom
time to time she pushed back her wet
hair and gazed at me with a pathetic
wistfulness which I affected not o

away and the big white moon was
sailing through the sky dotted with
scudding cloudrift.
I resigned her to the care of the so
licitous Mrs. Kerens, who was all sym
pathy and bustling motherllness.
Blakeslee. was there. In an agony of
contrition. I went away, changed my
wet clothing and sat down within tha
half-lighted library, gloomily watching
the pine logs In the wide fireplace.
After about an hour a timid hand
parted the curtains and I knew without
turning my head who it was. She came
in slowly.
"Jack," she said tremulously.
I sprang to my feet and offered ner Â»
chair. She refused to notice it. She
held out her hands. I In turn refused
to notice them.
"Jack." she whispered, **arÂ« you an

proper. "I am merely going tÂ» re
form."
She knew.
For a moment she stood silent, with
her head bent down. I stood gasteg
over her head with eyes which dared
not look for a moment at hers, else all
were lost. Then I heard her sob.
"It was a bad day for butterflies!" I
muttered huskily.
6he glanced up and I saw her eyes
filled with tears. "This butterfly is
tired, Jackâ dear Jack*" she whispered,
"It doesn't want to fly!"
"Never â for always?"
"Never â for always!"
It was good â all that wretchedness
and anxiety of long months, when she
lay tight against my breast and I
kissed the perverse, red lipsâ meek
now, and sweetly submissive. Per
verse no moreâ for the butterfly was
caught!

bedeviled heart I knew it would be the
truth.
I dug up my pipe and polluted the
sweet summer air for rods around. I
determined to be a pessimist and a
cynic and spend the rest of my life
sheering at everything I used to like. I
Jeered at the idea of human felicity and
wished I'd never been born. I had
what is technically known as the mol
lygrubs. And thenâ
the pines and already the wind waa
beginning to sway the tree tops. , I
rose and looked up : the river. No
canoe was in sight. Filled with alarm
I climbed into my canoe â a tiny thing
â and paddled furiously up the stream
ahead of the risins wind.
â¢ Half a mile up the river and no sign
of the canoeists. The wind swept
down and almost Instantly, the water
was beaten into whitecaps and the llt-
tie shell bobbed like a cork, but I held
it straight ahead and watched it with
the Instinct of one trained to the pad
dle. And then the rain came!
As I rounded a bend in the chan
nel I saw them. They were huddled
under a heavy pine near the water's
edge. The waves were trying to drag
the canoe away from the bank and
Blakeslee, the picture of woe, was
struggling to get it ashore.

THE girl with the violin, standing
before the great box of orchids,
sighed heavily.
"Oh.dear, why is everything in

"My dear Kara," said the woman
who read stories. "I hope you don't

"No, no; they are beautiful, butâ"

"But he writes to you?**

"Tro not sure of that, but I cannot
be happy in even accepting the orchids
when I think of Ulrlch. Ulrica would
bring me snowflowers*. with the breath
of the cold and the light of the stars
upon them. Theseâ they oppress me
â they seem to epeak of heat and of â
money."
"They mean money," said Miss
Fairlie, gravely, "but they probably
mean much more than that to the
giver. If they mean only that to
youâ" and a little Icy note uncon
sciously hardened her voice.
The other did not notice.
"I am grateful to him for these and
for all his kindnesses. He has offered
his carriage' for to-nightâ Mrs. Gray Is
to chaperone me, you know."
"Oh, yes, to-night is the Bardner
concert. I hope it will be a great tri
umph for you, Kara. And perhaps, dear
little girl, perhaps some of your doubts
may be settled for you to-night."
"I wish you and Kathleen were go
ing," wistfully.
"My dear," and a alight trace of bit
terness crept Into the even tones,
"when you are Mrs. James Coleridge
you will likely be invited to many af
fairs that are entirely out of ray life.
You are going to play something of
your own to-night, aren't you, Kara?"
"Yes, that one for two violins â the
Ttanz des Vacbes* comes in from the
distance, you remember."
"Yes, I remember it; it la beautiful."
"It Is not entirely my own composi

"But you would, like to play that
yourself?" smiling down on her.
"1 _would," she answered quietly,
"you cannot understand, of course,
but that part belongs to â to some one
else in a way that I cannot bear tÂ»
have a stranger "
"Enough, madame, you are first vio
lin. Begin." >
It was indeed a triumph for Kara.
The velvety applause pattered on and
on, and the two violinists were begged
to play again.
'.'Can you remember 'Loved One, Ever
Near?* " he whispered.
She turned a white, startled face
toward hlnC That was Ulrica Ges

"Quick, madame, the audienceâ"
"I remember," slowly, half-fright

"Play, then. I will taxe second."
And this time the excluslves fairly
rose in their chairs to express their
enthusiasm.
"Miss Venn is exceedingly fortu
nate," said .Mrs. Bardner, "and Baron

"Miss Venn, madame? Did you say

eagerly. Â¦
"I did," returned hla hostess, coldly,
"I would introduce' you butâ ** 'Â¦ &-kV,

who was standing . with Coleridge and

handsome young player.
"An importation, if I may so express
it, 'Of my own," she announced quite
audibly to the satellites circled about
her.
She swooped down upon Kara with
her. frigid air.
"At the last moment. Miss Venn,
that wretched Alboni sends me word
he is 111. So very annoying on his
part! In order to give you an oppor
tunity to play, I will ask Baron Jominl
to play with you, but of course you
must give him the first part. I could
not ask so great a musician to play
second f,o any one." .
. "But, Mrs.' Bardner, ! I could not per
mit any one else to play first violin
in this composition under any circum
stances," Kara protested firmly.
Mrs. Bardner stared at her, coldly
incredulous.- . ~"
"You evidently do not understand.
If I can- prevail upon' Baron Jominl
to play first violin your composition
will have a chance to be heardâother
wise "^.and a scornful shrug of the
sholders completed- the sentence.
The great" violinist listened to Mrs*
Bardner and went at once to Kara's
side.
- "1 am pleased to play with you,
madame," he said with simple cour
tesy, and took the music from her
shaking fingers, "which* part, ma
dame?" Â¦ . . i. â¢ Â¦ -\'
"You are kind to play at all/* she
responded ' earnestly, "and, Â¦ of course,
I must Â«ive you the first "
for the first violin, and he used to play
first in that when we were studying to
gether. I play first now, of course, and
Signor Alboni will take second."
"I prophesy a most gratifying suc
cess; and, Kara, I am deeply impresed
with the feeling that much more than
success â happiness â will come - to you
to-night. Go now and dress before your
carriage comes."
"She Is Just what he ought to have,"
mused Miss Fairlie, when the girl had
rone, "beautiful, giftedâ how proud he
will be of her. Bee, the unappreclative
child has forgotten the orchids!"
The excluslves at the Bardner con
cert softly tapped their gloved fingers
In delight. The Bardner affairs were
always bo charmingly unique!
"&he has some foreign nobleman here
to-night," whispered one .. beringed
dame to another, "Italian, I think. He
has consented to play here, a wonder
ful vlolliiist."
The nobleman was introduced with
many flourishesâ the Baron Jominl,
who had constnttd to honor, etc., etc.
He played magnificently. Mr. Coler
idge watched the girl with the violin.

Suddenly a great light broke over me,
and I saw where I had been playing
the fool instead of the wise general. I
had been giving her all the advantage;
and as I reviewed my case I grew "ut

what might, I would do sp no more. It
might break my heart, but I was de- '

Was patient, taciturn, untiring and, in
a conflict with the elements, ferocious.
All the fighting blood of his ancestors
seemed to course again in tho struggle
with the winter king. I can see him
yet, on bitter days, standing along
side the track, In a heavy peajacket
and Napoleon boots, a sealskin cap
drawn. snugly over hla straight, black
hair, watching, ordering, signaling,
while No. 1, with its frost bitten sleep
ers behind a rotary, struggled to buck
through the ten and twenty foot cuts,
which lay bankful of snow west of
McCloud.
But during the last moments Georgie
Sinclair stepped up to the booth and
cast a storm of votes for old man San
key. Doto-n's friends and Stewart's
votes kept pouring in amazingly. The
favorites grew frightened; they pooled
their issues by throwing Stewart's vote
to Doton; but it wouldn't do. Georgie
Sinclair, with a crowd of engineers-
Cameron, Moore. Foley, Bat Mullen
and Burnsâ came back at them with
such a swing that in the final round
up they fairly swamped Doton. San
key took the lantern by .a' thousand
votes, but I understood It cost Georgie
and his friends a pot of money.
Barfkey said all the time he didn't
want the lantern, but, just the same,
he always carried that particular lan
tern, with his full name,\Sylvester
Sankey, ground into the glass just be

was a lantern to be voted to the most

Pausing for hardly a breath the sig

up and up and up the line, and again
the massive machines were hurled
screaming into the cut. . .
"You're getting there, Georgie," ex
claimed Sankey when the rolling and
lurching had stopped. No one else
could tell a thing about it, for it was
snow and snow and snow, above and
behind, and ahead and beneath. Sin
clair coughed the flakes out of his
eyes and nose and mouth like a baffled
collie. He looked doubtful of the claim
until the mist had blown clear and the
quivering monsters were again recalled
for a dash. Then It was plain that .
Bankey's Instinct was right; they were
gaining.
Again they went in, lifting a very
avalanche over the stacks, packing the
late; it was ;. Sankey's - and Sinclair's
run west.:
There was a long council In the
roundhouse. The rotary was knocked
out; coal was running low in the
chutes. If the line wasn't kept open
for the coal from the mountains it was
plain we should be tied until we could
ship It from Iowa or' Missouri. West
of Medicine Pole there was another big
rotary working east, with plenty of
coal behind her, but she wes reported
stuck fast in the Cheyenne Hills.
Foiey made suggestions, and Dad
Sinclair ir.adÂ« suggestions. Everybody
had a suggestion left. The trouble was,
Neighbor said, they didn't amount to
anything or were" impossible. > "
"It's a dead block, boys," announced
Neighbor, sullenly, after everybody had
done. "We are beaten unless we can
set No. 1 through to-day. Look there'.
By the holy poker it's snowing again!"
The air was dark: in a minute with
whirling clouds. Men â¢ turned to the
windows and quit talking; every fellow
felt the same â at least all but one. San
key, sitting back of the stove, was
making tracings on his overalls with a
piece of chalk.
- "You might as well unload your pas
sengers, . Sankey," ' said Neighbor.
"You'll never get 'em through this
winter."
And it was then that Sankey pro
posed his double-header.
He devised a snowplow that combined
in one monster ram about all the good
material we had left, and submitted the
scheme' to Neighbor. Neighbor-studied
it and hacked at it all he could, and
brought it over to the office. It was
like staking everything on the last cast
of the dice, but we were in the state
of mind which precedes a desperate
venture. It was talked over for an
hour, and' orders were finally given by
the superintendent to rig up the double
header and get against the snow as
quick as it could be made ready.
All that day and moBt of the night
Neighbor worked; twenty men on San
key's device. By Sunday morning it
was in such shape that we began to
take heart. i Â¦
"If she don't get through she'll get
back again, and that's what most of
'em don't do," growled Neighbor, as
he and Sankey showed the new ram
to the engineers. '
They had taken the 568, Georgie Sin
clair's engine, for one head and Burns*
497 for the other. Behind these were
-Kennedy with the 314 and Cameron
with the 296. "The engines were set in
pairs, headed each way, and buckled
up like packmules. Over the pilots and
stacks of the head engines rose the
tremendous plows, which were to tackle
the toughest drifts ever recorded, before
or' since,' on the West End. The ram
was designed to work both ways. Un
der the coal each tender was loaded
with, plglron.
â¢ The beleaguered passenjrers en No.
1, sidetracked in the yards, watched
the preparations Sankey was making
to clear the line. Every amateur on the
we ladles were compelled to content
ourselves with bread and batter and. I
fear, a few regrets audibly expressed.
A friend calling during the evening
suggested that we have our meals
brought from the cafe â a common cus
tom h.ereâ pending the arrival of our
cook. One has a set of tins made,: fit

through rings at the sides. The bot

vegetables, etc., are placed above one
another in the successive tins.

THE oldest man in the train ser
vice didn't pretend to say how
long Sankey had worked for the
j company.
P^t Francis was a very old
conductor, but old man Sankey was a
veteran when Pat Francis was brak
ing. Sankey ran a passenger train
when Jimmie Brady was runningâ and
Jimrr.ie afterward enlisted and was
kilied in the Custer fight.
There was an odd tradition about
Sankey's name. He was a tall, swarthy
fellow, and carried the blood of a Sioux
chief in his veins. It was in the time
cf the Black Hills excitement, when
railroad men, struck by the gold fever,
were abandoning their trains, even at
way stations, and striking across the
divide for Clark's crossing. Men to run
the trains were hard to get, and Tom
Porter, trainmaster, was putting In
every man he could pick up, without
reference to age or color.
Porter â he died at Julesburg after
ward â was a great jollier, and he
wasn't afraid of anybody on earth.
One day a war* party of Sioux clat
tered Into town. They tore around like
a storm, and threatened to scalp every
thing, even to local tickets. The head
braves dashed in on Tom Porter, sit
ting in the dispatcher's office upstairs.
The dispatcher v.as hiding under a
loose plank In the baggage-room floor;
Tom, being bald as a sandhill, consid
ered himself exempt from scalping par
ties. He was working a game of soli
taire when they bore down on him. and
Interested them at once. That led to a
parley, which ended in Porter's hiring
the whole band to brake on freight
trains. Old man Sankey Is Eald to hava
been one of that original war party.
Now this Is merely a caboose storyâ
told on winter nights when trainmen
rÂ»t stalled In the snow drifting down
from the Bioux country. But what
follows is better attested.
Eankey, to start with, had a peculiar
r.anae. An unpronounceable, unsella
ble, unmanageable name. I never
heard It, so I can't give It. It was as
hard to catch as an Indian cur, and
that name made more trouble >m the
ray roils than all the other names put
together. Nobody at headquarters
could handle it; it was never turned in
twice alike, and they were always
v riling Tom Porter about the thing.
Tom explained several times that it
was Fitting Bull's embassador who
was drawing that money, and he usu
ally signed the pay roll with a toma
hawk. But nobody at Omaha ever
knew how to take a" joke.
The firvt time Tom went down he
r\as called in very solemnly to explain
again about the name, and being in a
hurry and very tired of the whole
business Tom spluttered:
"Hang ir, don't bother me any more
about that name. If you can't read it
make it Sankey and be done with it."
They took Tom at his word. They
actually did make it Sankey* and
that's hÂ«'v our oldest conductor ceme
to bear the name of the famous singer.
And more I may say; good name as it
wasâ and is â the Sioux never disgraced
it.
Probably every old traveler on the
system knew Sankey. He was not only
always ready to answer questions, but.
what is rr.uch* mere, always ready to
answer the same question twice. It in
that which makes conductors gray
headed and spoils their . chances for
heaven â answering the same questions
over and over again. Children were
apt to be a bit startled at first sight of
Eankey â he was so dark. But he bad
a very quiet smile that always made
them friends after the second trip
through the sleepers, and they some
times ran about asking for him after
he had left the train. ._
Of late years â and It is this that
hurts â these very eame children, grown
ever eo much bigger, and riding again
to cr from California or Japan or Aus
tralia, will ask when they reach the
West End about the- Indian conductor.
* But the conductors who now run
tha overland trains pause at the ques
tion, checking over the date limits on
tha margins of the coupon tickets, and.
banding the envelopes back, will look
at the children aad say, slowly: "He
Isn't running any more."
Â¦L
If rou hava ever gone over our Una
to tha mountains or to the coast you
cay remember at McCloud, where they
charge engines and set the diner In or
out. the pretty little green park to
the east of the depot with a row of
c&talpa trees along the platform line.
It looks like a glass of spring water.
If It happened to be Sankey's run
and a regular West End day, sunny
and delightful, rou would be sure to
see standing under the catalpas a shy,
dark-eklnned girl of fourteen or fifteen
years, silently watching the prepara
tions for the departure of the Over
land.
And after the new engine had been
backed, champing down, and harnessed
to its long string of vestlbuled sleep
ers; after the air hose had been con
nected and the air valves examined:
after the engineer had swung out of
his cab, filled his cups and -swung In
again; alÂ»ar the fireman and his help
er had disposed of their sllcebar and
shovel and given the tender a final
sprinkle, and the conductor had
walked leisurely forward, compared
time with the engineer, and cried, "All
abo-o-o-ard"'
Then, as your coach moved slowly
ahead, you might notice under the re
ceding catalpas the little girl waving
a parasol, or ,a handkerchief, at the
out-going train â that Is, at Conductor
Sankey; for she was his daughter,
Necta Sankey. Her mother was Span
ish, and died when Neeta was a wee
bit. Nef-ta and the Limited were San
key's whole world.
When Georgie Sinclair began pulling
the limited, running west opposite
Foley. he struck up a great friendship
with Sankey. Sankey, t&ough he was
hard to start, was full of early day
t-tories. Gc-orgle, it seemed, had the
faculty of getting him to talk; perhaps
becaus- when he was pulling Sankey's
train he made extraordinary efforts to
keep on time â time was a hobby with
Sankey. Foley said he was so care
ful about it that when he was off
duty be let his watch stop just to save
time.
Sankey loved to breast the winds
and the floods and the snows, and if
he could get home pretty near on
schedule, with everybody else late, he
was happy; and in respect of that, as
Sankey used to say, Georgie Sinclair
could come nearer gratifying Sankey's
ambition than any runner we had.
Even the firemen used to observe
that the young engineer, always neat,
locked still neater the days that he
took Sankey's train. By and by there
was an introduction under the catal
pas; after that it was noticed that
Georgie began wearing gloves on the
engine â not kid gloves, but yellow dog
skinâand black silk shirts; he bought
them in Denver.
Thenâ an odd way engineers have of
banks of tha out with walls hard aa
lea. Again as tha drivers stuck they
raced In a freniy, and into tha shriek
of tha wind went the unearthly scrap**
of the overloaded safeties.
Slowly and sullenly tha machines
were backed again. .
"She's doing tha work, Georgle,"
cried Sankey. "For that kind of a cut
she's as good as a rotary. Look every
thing over now while I go â¢ back and
see how tha boys are standing It.
Then we'll give her one more, and give
it the hardest kind."
And they did give her one more â
and another. Men at Santiago put up
no stouter fight than they that made
that Sunday morning In the canyon of
the Blackwood. Once and twice more
they went in. And the second time
tha bumping drummed . more, deeply;
the drivers held, pushed, panted and
gained against the white wallâ heaved
and stumbled aheadâ and with a yell
from Sinclair and Sankey and the fire
man, the double-header shot her nose
Into the clear over the Â¦ Blackwood
gorge. As engine after engine flew
past the divided walls each cab took
up tha cryâ It was the wildest shout
that ever crowned victory.
Through they went and half-way

check their monster catapult. Then
at a half-full they shot it back at the
cut â it worked as well one way as the
other. â¢ â¢ â¢

key. Then they got into position In

mountain of snow to split.
"Look the - machines over close.
ret his baby cubs in h&r* and keep
'em- chasing all night; but It's don*
snowin," he added, looking into tha
leaden sky.
He had everything figured out for
the . master mechanic â tha shrewd,
kindly old man. There's no man on
earth like a good Indian; and for
that matter none like a bad one. San
key knew by a military Instinct Just
what had to be done and how to do It.
If he had lived ha was to hava been
assistant superintendent; that waÂ»
the word that leaked from headquar
ters after he got killed.
And with a volley'of jokas between
the cabs and a laughing and a yell-
Ing between toots down went Sankey's
double-header again Into tha Black
wood gorge.
At the same moment, by an awful
misunderstanding of orders, down
came the big rotary from the West
End with a dozen cars of coal behind
It. Mi!e after mils It had wormed
east toward Sankey's ram. burrowed
through the western cut of the Black
wood, crashed through the drift San
key was aiming for and whirled then
out Into the open, dead against him,
at forty miles an hour. Each train,
in order to make the grade and tha
blockade, was straining tÂ«he cylinders.
Through the swirling snow which
half hid the bridge and swept be
tween the rushing plows Sinclair saw
them coming â he yelled. Sankey saw
'them a fraction of a second later and
while Sinclair struggled with the
throttle and the air, Sankey gave the
alarm through the whistle to the poor
fellows in tive blind pockets behind.
But the track was at the worst. Where
there was no snow there were whis
kers; oil itself couldn't have been
worse to stop on. It was the old and
deadly peril of fighting blockades from
both ends on a single track.
The great rams of steel and fire
had done their work and with their
common enemy overcome they dash
ed at each other frenzied across tha
Blackwood gorge.
The fireman at the first cry shot out
the side. Sankey yelled at Sinclair to
jump. But George shook his head;
he never would Jump. Without hesi
tating an Instant Sankey caught him
in his arms, tore him from the lev
ers, planted a mighty foot and hurled
Sinclair like a block of coal through
the gangway out into the gorge. The
other cabs were already emptied; but
the Instant's delay In front cost San
key's life. Before he could turn the
rotary crashed into 56Â«. They reared
like mountain lions and pitched head
long into the gorge; Sankey went un
der them.
He could have saved himself: ha
chose to save George. There wasn't
time to do both; he had to choose and
he chose Instinctively. Did he, maybe,
think In that Cash of Neeta and of
whom she needed mostâ of a young and
stalwart protector better than an old
and a falling one? I do not know. I
only know what he did.
Every one who lumped got dtar.
Sinclair lit In twenty feet Â«f snow, and
they pulled him out with a rope. Ha
wasn't even scratched. Even the bridge
was not badly strained. No. 1 pulled
over it next day. Sankey was right:
there was no more snow; not enough to
hide the dead engines on the rocks; tha
line was open.
There never was a funeral In Mo-
Cloud like Sankey's. George Sinclair
and Neeta followed together; and of
mourners there were as many ai there
were people. Every engine on the di
vision carried black for thirty days.
His contrivance for fighting snow has
never yet been beaten on the high
line. It Is perilous to go against a
drift behind Itâ something has to give.
But It gets thereâ as Sankey got
thereâ always; and In time of block

it lends itself readily to all sorts of
conditions.
One of the very new ways of using
lace ia to make insertions of lace and
border them with satin ruchlngs. Nar
row satin ribbon Is used and the nich
ing Is made thick and full. This is
sewed around the edge of the lace ap
plication, which is then set upon the
skirt of the dress. The applications
are used to trim skirts and waists and
they are also seen upon sleeves, and
always with the edging of ribbon,
which gives the finishing touch to the
lace. .
Then . there is the lace ornament
which is so charming upon the sum
mer gowns. This ornament : is made
of lace .shirred along one edge. .This
hair string Is pulled and the rosette Is
made; When -completed it is .about
the size of a : silver and ia
ready .to be , used.' If desired Â¦ a little
Jewel can be Bet in the middle of the
lace 'Â¦ rosette/
Â¦ ; " Little' lace roses are charming things
and a group- of these tiny roses In
white lace with small red silk roses
set In the middle were observed upon
one of the prettiest evening gowns of
the season. These lace roses In groups
of six or eight trim the skirts of even
ing gowns and the skirts of day gowns.
They are delightfully dainty and are
feminine to the very last degree.
And there Is still another new fad for
the woman who likes pretty trimmings
and this Is a French fad. Wide bands
of silk are sewed to the neck of the
gown. They hang to the waist line,
where they are bordered with lace.
Under these squares of lace there are
set bits of colored silk while the lace Is
embroidered In silk design. Little lacy
fancies these are, but charming in the
sum and substance of the season's
wardrobe.
One of the sweetest gownsâ for it can
be called by no other nameâ Is a dress
In Japanese crepe. The groundwork is
a deep cream, while the figures are tiny
dots, put on to form open squares.
These dots make an exquisite founda
tion for the^ trimming, which consists
of hundreds of little lace roses put on
In clusters.
Waists of Japanese crepe are pretty
for evening. They are cut very low In
the neck and very short In the sleeves.
Around the neck are two deep ruffles of
the crepe, each one embroidered In gold
threads, with threads of chrysanthe
mum pink run In through the gold. The
neck Is finished very simply with a
band of deep red velvet and the elbows
are finished In the same manner.
She who desires a Japanese crepe
luncheon waist can make It of crepe
ruffles, one falling over the other and
each one prettily- embroidered. The
neck can be fashioned of deep red taf
feta, or what Is prettier and less ag
gressive, a guimpe In a shade of coral
red. A spray of roses la fastened upon
one shoulder.
There is a great fancy for trimming
the- necks and shoulders of gowns
with, bands of velvet ...These .velvet
strappings ;go ; over -the shoulder and
over the arm; ; A band, of velvet also
extends ', around the yoke. The gir
dle â¢ matches, this" band of velvet
Bands of velvet form a very effective
trimming, and! they are used upon
waists for evening' in place of shoul
der straps of Jewels and in place ef
shoulder straps of flowers.
Velvet is very freely, used this sum-
mer and Its place is not upon heavy
gowns and gowns of taffeta as much
as upon the lighter summer fabrics,
to which it gives the touch which was
needed. Velvet bands and velvet
shoulder straps, velvet girdles and
velvet stocks and velvet panels have
all been revived and are seen this
summer In most bewildering array.
Beautiful spring coats are made of
tan colored taffeta and of black taf
feta and white. These taffeta coats
are delightful In cut and are made
In all the varieties and vagaries of
Dame Fashion's dictate.
One of the prettiest styles Is that of
a modified kimono. This Is straight
with strappings of cloth. The cloth,
which Is not more than half an Inch
wide, is stitched along both edges. It
extends up the front and all around thÂ»
lower edge of the coat A similar band
of taffeta Is used to outline the yoke
and extends around the neck and up
on the coat In great swirls.
The sleeves of this taffeta kimono
are very wide and are finished with
stitched bands of cloth, which Is also
put on in swirla. The yoke is trimmed
with swirls of cloth stitched upon both
edges.
The vest of this coat Is fashioned of
Persian embroidery, which Is carried
out In many colors. Red and blue and
1 green are outlined upon a background
of pastel tone.
An elaborate little coat of this kind
can be worn either with a silk skirt or
one of cloth and la equally pretty with
satin or with taffeta. It makes a nice
little coat for calllag and reception
wear and it makes a pretty coat for
gayer days and rougher occasions.
Bxqulsite are new stocks, with their
delicate trimmings. There are stocks
made of lace, all open work, and there
are stocks that are the very height of
elaboration. One lovely stock la made
of taffeta, with an embroidered pea
â¢ cock feather running all the way
around the neck.. Another has peacock
feathers running around the belt In
front there Is a peacock clasp made of
gold and brllIlants^Mifl3BBfi|B
A beautiful stock from a dressmak

embroidered with sold bands and with

gowns.' . ' . Â¦. '
The woman with time on her hands
and half a yard of taffeta;. or of satin,
or louisine, . In her work basket ; can
cut a dozen wedge shaped pleoes, point
the wedge Â¦ at its biggest â¢ end and go
to work. She will want to" work these
silk wedges t in the prettiest i color de
s"ign possible' and her . best medium will
be a cross iBUtch- embroidery, \which;
should trim "the ," edges" of ; the* wedges
and , also the center. * Or. she can leave
the ' middle, plain and' make a nice . bor
der .for the; edge.
; The 'inlets 1 of ; lace are not; so much
eeen as Â¦ they were, but there'; la ' a lace
trimming which ' is quite as effective
and Is ; much , more ; in vogue. This is
the lace Â¦ medallion lined with ., a color
mine, hangs like taffeta In its pretty
stiffness and wears like iron," said she,
"and the color is the new sealskin
brown, Just the shade for traveling.
"The trimming, as you will observe.
Is what I call exchangeable," continued
the girl. "The girdle is wide and Is
made of blue liberty in a shade of corn
flower; the stock is high and transpar
ent and Is partly blue liberty and part
ly brown silk. There Is a wide collar of
ecru lace, and the undersleeves are of
lace falling below open balloons of
brown etamlne. Oh, you can do a lot
with linen If you go at It cleverly, for
this etamlne is one of the new grades
of nice linen goods.
"For my other summer linens I would
have a fine- India linen* for evening, a
linen as heavy as lawn for garden par
ties and a morning linen or, two. Then
I would have one of. the coarse affairs
In tan color, with red and blue nub ef
fects, and I would wind up with a linen
crash and half a. dozen skirts in red
and white and blue for day wear. That
comes to more than half a dozen, does
It not? But they could all be used in
the summer's wardrobes.. And one
would not need much else." Â¦ ;
The combining of two kinds of linen
Is one of the pretty Ideas of the sum
mer. And so beautifully Is It carried
out that there are waists which are fine
enough for full dress occasions, yet
which have nothing to recommend
them in the way of material except
that they are of an exquisite quality, of
linen, put together with great neatness
and all by hand. .
One of these waists Is mad* with
Dutch neck and plain yoke. Beginning
at the shoulders there are six little ruf
fles of linen which come down to the
bust line, . one falling over the other
and each one edged with a narrower
ruffle of linen. Below this there are
two wider ruffles of linen falling to the
belt line. This Is a ruffled waist which
could be worn for any occasion, with a
wide, girdle of -white or of any other
color. .; \
The polka dot has v broken out afresh
this year And In many new spots. There
Is the. material ''which Is plain dotted
and there are numerous new goods
which; show dots of another material.
There are linens with satin-like dots and
there are beautiful silks with dots of
lace. There are dotted lawns and sheer
dotted goods of every conceivable kind
and there are dotted stuffs whose dots
vary In size from great to small. In
this way the polka doited gowns main
tain their popularity. â
One of the most gorgeous polks, dots
for evening is made with a plain skirt
shirred around the hips. The Bhlrrlngs
are' strapped with narrow satin ribbon.
Around the foot of this gown there are
three ruffles or flounces; the same width
all the way around, and put on with a
little shirring at the top.
The waist of this dress is a beautiful
thing. It is gathered across the yoke
and Is gathered in again at tha belt
The sleeves are full puffed sleeves, with
the droop all at the elbow, and the
neck has a yoke which can be lifted out
when the gown is desired for dinenr
wear.
This matter of lifting- out the neck of
a gown Is one which should be seriously
considered by the summer woman. The'
guimpe Is In style and this . affords
abundant opportunity for .the taking
out of the guimpes by courtesy, which
can also be taken out of the neck of the
dress when a low neck is desired. . This
gives the summer woman a'flne chance
for making a change In her gowns, as
well as a fine opportunity for renewing
a neck that is soiled or that does not
match the skirt of her gown.
There Is a fad. which is being carried
out upon many, of the ' new costumes
and in tha prettiest possible manner.
Bands of silk are embroidered by hand
and used as a dress trimming. These â¢
bands, which should be twelve in num
ber, art about twelve inches long. They
are cut wedge shaped, with the big end
of the wedge cut to a point
These silk bands are trimmed with a
cross stitch embroidery, put^on; around
the edge in many colors. * The sleeves
are banded in this manner, as are the
shoulders and also the "waist and the
skjrt, Tj&ge make Â§ yerjr pjcÂ«. and ;
** â¢"JTIVE me a touch of sold,"
If said the summer elrl. reach-
V/Tlns out her hand to where
(V there lay a little twisted
ekein of gold braid, partly black and
partly creer. a slender mixed braid
with the gold running through it like
a shining thread.
"Give me one touch of gold and I
can transform thl3 waist from an af
ternoon waist, a 6imnlÂ« affair of no
distinction whatever, into something
nice er.ougrh for luncheon, fine enough
even for dinners."
The waist, which was a leaf green
china silk, was made with little strap
pings acroF3 the front, each strap
consisting of a band of ribbon wth
fcuttens oa the end. The buttons were
liny sold affairs and the braid was
vert-' slender and very bright gold.
Tha pretty girl who wanted a touch
cf sold traced a pattern upon the
front and with supple fingers she out-,
lined .1 figrure upon the sleeves. When
ehe had finished the waist was glo
rious "with Its golden lights. "That
makes n. French waist of it," said she,
jiattir.g it with approval, "for all Par
isian waists have a little gold."
The touch of gold Is indeed upon
everything. The gold <*e>es not take
violent forms, but It Is used delicately.
It is not seen In wide strappings nor
In broad bands, nor yet in heavy ap-
Xilicatfons. But. on the other hand,
it is used in very subtle ways. Threads
of sold are run around low Dutch
recks: gold stitchings are used down
the fronts of waists; gold traceries
Iedorn buttonholes and outline them
and half the buttons show touches of
pold and are surrounded bjÂ» gold or
naments, such* as gold passementerie.
In this way gold is Introduced In the
gowns of summer.
One lovely Bummer suit was made
of coral voile, a brilliant gown, In
marvelous hue. Its only trimming
consisted of buttons of gold trimmed
with coral and of yards and yards of
white lace with coral traceries upon
the liice.
Thus, and in ingenious ways, is gold
brought into a costume, and thus, and
In diverse ways, it is made to trim a
gow n and to set it off delicately.
There Is always a dress sensation
ar.d the novelty this week is found In
the English embroideries, which . are
being introduced upon gowns. This
English embroidery is the old fash-
eyelet embroidery and the pre't
tiest dresses of the season are trim
med with It and made up with no
ether decoration except this.
English embroidery forms not only
the panels and the ruffles of wash
dresses, but of other gowns as well.
Eilk dresses have panels down the
front carried out in this manner, and
there are gowns with sleeves, neck
a.nd yoke punched full of eyelet holes
end worked very much as one worked
the flannel petticoats some years ago.
It Is a poor week that has only one
dress sensation and this week Is par
ticularly rich. In that it has no lesa
than six, one of the prettiest of which
Is found in the new collar. This col
lar, which is, of course, a revival col
lar, is brought out again and is chris
tened the Spanish collar, probably be
cause it Is made so frequently of
Spanish lace.
The Spanish collar Is made In sev
eral forms and it is made out of all
kinds- of lace and is worn upon every
gown under the . sun- Nothing Is
,Â«xempt from the Influence of the lace
collar, whether It be the delicate
sown of organdie, upon which the lace
collar seems eminently suitable, or the
gown of ladles cloth over which the
lace collar Is a novelty.
The collar is made square, ; s
brought around the shoulders and Is
crossed In front. The ends hang down
In two long tabs below the belt line.
This style of collar Is particularly
beautiful, giving something of the old
time look so much desired. #> >;. ;
Collar lace can be of any kind, but
It is Quite a fad to choose three kinds
of lace and combine them in one big
collar. There is filet upon which
heavy lace can be appliqued, while
around the edge there can be set a
border of Valenciennes lace. Then
there are the Escurial laces, which are
very good for collar laces, and there
is Spanish lace, which Is revived from
the attics and old trunks and which
is the very best of all.
Piece lace makes a delightful . col
lar and It Is inexpensive. Tou take
the lace and spread It down, laying a
wide collar pattern upon It. Tou cut
out the pattern carefully and then
you finish the edges of the collar in
one of several ways. You can take
and border it with lace, simply laying
the lace on flat so as to' cover the
ragged edge, and for this purpose
Valenciennes lace is very nice, or any
of the other narrow laces can be used.
And there is another way to deal '
r.-ith the ragged edges. Take the col
lar and border It with a band of silk,
put on like a piping. This gives a
strong, secure edge, one that will be
durable and much admired for many
a long day, as long as there Is a rag
of the lace left '-*

Too much has been said on the sub

Too few parents realize the necessity
for regular work and exercise for both
boys and girls. All should have some
play. Few, if any, will be injured by a
reasonable amount of regular work.

if he can do the same.
As children grow older they become
less sensitive to the little trials and
learn to bear disappointments. They
are then better able to loos more upon
the bright side of life; for experience
has taught them that the clouds will
pass away. When they grow still old
er and have children of their own they
are apt to forget that, as children,
they ever had any sorrow. For this
reason they often* fail to show that
sympathy which they should always
show. Â«
Sometimes the lessons which the
children, are given in school are, far
harder than parents or teachers think.

you to make any progress." Is It any

Parents should plan, if possible, to
give the last half hou- cr so to the
children. Even with the younger chil

most certainly gain their confidence. At
this time they, and especially the older
ones, will tell many things which they

It is, therefore, by fax the best time for
parents to have heart to heart talks
with boys and cirls.

stands to the. south of the old sem
inary building and just within the
edge of a noble grove of live oak, flr
and eucalyptus trees, which stretches
over the larger part of the campus.
The bells', which are ten In num
ber, vary in size from 250 to 2500
pounds. They are attuned to a musical
scale and -connected not only with
the clock, but with a console within
the building. Following the old cus
tom of naming bells, Mr. H6wes de
sired that they should bear the names
bf the graces of the spirit as found in
Galatians v:22-23. The four that
ring the chime are Faith. Hope. Peace
and Joy. The largest bell is Love; the
smallest, Meekness. The others are
Gentleness. Goodness, Self-Control
and Long Suffering.
Their history is an interesting one.
They were cast at Cincinnati and were
first heard at the Chicago World's
Fair. Later they were exhibited at
the Midwinter Fair at San Francisco
In 1194. At both fairs they were
awarded medals. They were bought
at the close of the California exposi
tion as a gift to Stanford University,
but that institution was then laboring
through the "dark days" of the great
lawsuit and was unable to erect even
so small a building as a bell tower.
Mr. Hewes accordingly offered the
bells' to Mills College and they were
accepted In 1902. For over a year,
because there were, no means to erect
a suitable tower for such a chime, the
bells found a quiet resting place on
the ground near Lisser Hall and there
they â¢ soon became known as "Our
Silent Ten."
At the recent dedicatory services
Mrs. Mills told the story of the gift
of the tower. She said:
"At our last commencement as X
was passing with some of our friends
'near the bells, I said: 'And here are
our silent ten.' A gentleman asked
his wife afterward what. I meant and
she explained to him. Not long after
he asked her: 'Would you like to help
those bells to ring?' and, planning as
they always do so beautifully together,
they decided to give the bells a home."
The campanile Is not the only gift
for which Mills has to thank Mr. and
Mrs. Smith. ; They were the principal
donors a year ago of the large organ
In Lisser Hall. And Mr. Hewes' Is not
to be remembered merely for his
chime of bells. At the Stanford
Museum he Is represented by a large
and valuable art collection, given in
memory of his wife/ Anna Lathrop
Hewes. JP. W. POWELL.
TRADITION and sentiment have
firmly woven a subtle bond be
tween chimes and colleges. At
Amhem -and at Princeton they
point out with j,ri<le their old chapel
bells, and in the newer institutions at
Ithaca and Palo Alto they were not
content until there had been installed
a chime of bells. It has remained,
however, for Mills College of Oakland,
the one woman's institution of rank
in all the V.'c-st, to erect the only dis
tlncti%dy college bell tower in the
country.
This beautiful structure, which has
Just been formally dedicated, was
xnade possible through the munifi
cence of Mr. and Mrs. Frank M.
6ml th of Oakland and David B. Hewes
of Los Anseles. a brother-in-law of
Mrs. Jane L. Stanford. Designed by
Miss Julia Morgan in the style of the
old Spanish missions, the tower is
built of rough faced gray concrete.
Red terra cotta tiles cover Its roof
and corner buttresses and California
redwood furnishes the ornamental
work. It rises in, three sections to a
height of seventy-five feet. At the
base its dimensions are 12x25 feet, but
at the top it is but half that size. The
Trails are pierced, mission-like, on
tide and pable with arched bell niches
and panel windows. On the front ga
ble alone appears the bronze face of
the clock, which marks the quarters
and at hourly intervals gives the full
Westminster chime. This clock Is the
gift of the faculty, students and
friends of the college. Especially In
teresting Is the door with Its quaint
old lock and nail-studded surface. It
is the gift of Mrs. Amelia W. Trues
dale of San Francisco, a graduate of
Stanford, who procured it from an
old Spanish church In Mexico. Above
the entrance Is a small tablet, which
bears the names of the donors of the
tower. Another to the left records In
elmilar fashion the name of the giver
of the chime. On the opposite side
1Â» the inscription: "In loyal remem
brance of those who by tongue or pen,
by generous gift or noble. deed have
tided woman on her upward way,
these bells chime on."
A parapet of concrete surrounds the
base of the campanile, its walls sup
porting large, beautiful rases design
ed after those at the Alhambra In

Stickley is seriously contemplating
the establishment of a community in
California, where all kinds of me
chanical arts will be practiced and
taught, render his statements here
with of both interest and value.
It so happened that James Henry
had a brother -George who was every
thing that a young man should be who
was distributing such a name as that
over the country. The only thing that
George had ever been known to drink
that was stronger than spring water
was ginger ale and it was currently re
ported that he imbibed that only on
the advice of his family physician.
While James Henry was making night
more or less hideous with his search
for new places to get drunk in George
was sitting in the shadow of a stu
dent's lamp with a green shade over
his eyes and soaking up learning from
a bound file of the Popular Science
Monthly, with Darwin on the side. .
When he felt the need of relaxation
he would go around the corner to an old
friend of his mother's and play euchre
with the young ladies or sing "Bedelia"
to a mandolin accompaniment. He was
a standing imitation o: the model
young man, and could talk by the hour
with the old lady about the awful
habits that the young men of the pres
ent day were subject to.
After the old folks had tried moral
suasion and financial pressure on
James Henry to Induce him to for
sake the ways of sin. and even con
sidered the advisability of a small In
jection of bichloride of gold or a
pinch of the willow bark treatment,
the great idea suddenly burst upon
them that the proper caper was to
send. brother George out with him as
a sort of amateur missionary. They
had It all flsrured out that the pres
ence of George would be a standing
reproach to James Henry and that In
the course of time he would forsake
his evil ways and the cocktail that
flieth by night, anil likewise by high
noon, .and would join George at the
ginger ale fount.
Accordingly the suggestion was
made to James Henry that he should
invite his brother to live with him in
his bachelor apartments for a few
weeks for a change. James Henry was
on to their curves, but he had an idea
that he could see a little amusement
for himself in the dim distance and
he accepted the proposition without a
quiver. He knew that If there was
any trouble coming it wasn't ad-
Yf AMES Henry was the president of
I the Association for the Punlsh
\ ment of Strong Drink and he
(%) worked at his business most of
*-' his waking hours, as well as
many of those when he sure
whether he was awake or not. Also,
he was a director of the International
Society of Boose Fighters and of the
Union for the Promotion of Bromo
Seltzer. As a horrible example for
the use and Instruction of the
members of the W. C. T.. U. be
would have been a tremendous suc
cess and the fool killer would have
found enough material In him to work
over for a month. Ostensibly James
Henry was practicing law, but the only
bar with which he was appreciably fa
miliar was the one with a railing
around the bottom and a handout of
cheese and crackers at the other end.
It was generally supposed that James
Henry's case was incurable. The only
hope for him was that the supply of
spirituous liquor would run out before
he had succeeded in quenching his
thirst and that he would turn his feet
into the paths of righteousness and
sobriety because the other roads were
marked "No Thoroughfare." Those who
are familiar with the yearly output of
the breweries and distilleries of this
broad land, up to and including Ger
many and Scotland, will realize how
slender a thread James Henry's friends
and creditors were clinging to.
The mistake that th? people who nr-*
ranged the contest matle was in, not Â¦
recognizing the fundamental fact In
human pomology that it is always th>?
good apples that are spoiled. If that
Â¦wasn't the case there would never be
any damaged fruit in the barrel.
(Copyright. 1003. by Albert Brltt)
dressed to him. He had had such a
wide and varied experience with that
article In all its forms that he hadn't
a doubt In the world of his ability to
handle all that might come down the
pike. The first night that the two
brothers foregathered in James Hen
ry's choice apartments Qeorge sug
gested that they do a little turn with
"Romola" by way of stimulating the
imagination. He informed James
Henry that he had mapped out a
course of reading that would last
them through the winter and was
guaranteed to give them more pure,
dyed-ln-the-wool culture to the super*
flclal square Inch of gray matter
than any other Intellectual programme
that had ever been put together.
James Henry's reading had been lim
ited to the hotel directory and the
tips for the next day's races, but he
wasn't averse to trying his hand at a
new game If it promised any sort of
stimulation. Stimulation was the
thing that he was after.
The course of every man his own
culturine sailed along beautifully for
a week or two until even George began
to wonder If there wasn't something
that he could do that would break up
the monotony a little. Away from the
family circle without any obligation to
announce the schedule and running
time of his next trip, every time he
went outside the house after dark he
felt that It would be a pity if he
couldn't put his time to better use than
in reading about things that never
happened and wouldn't have Interested
very many people if they had. So
when James Henry suggested one
evening that Instead of sitting down
and communing with the spirits of the
past they should saunter around the
corner to where some spirits of the
very Immediate present held forth he
was nothing loth.
James Henry let him down rather
easily the first night, although George
had a dim Idea when he pried his eyes
the next morning that the ginger alo
he was supposed to have absorbed
must have been In proximity to
something stronger at some period of
its career." Every one knows that gin
ger ale under certain circumstances
has tremendous absorbing powers, but
In the course of the next month George
developed similar powers that mado
ginger ale look like a stone wall. He
could go the pace with James Henry
any night in the week and two or
three times had been the only one who
could tell the cabman the way home
after the meeting had adjourned.
All this while the people at home
were congratulating themselves that
they had struck the nail on the head
when they sent George down to reform
his brother; they hadn't heard the lat
est bulletins from the seat of war. If
they had they would have considered
the advisability of recalling James
Henry to keep him from being ruined
by associating with George. The lat
ter had by this time displaced his
brother from all the official positions
enumerated In the introductory para
graph of this brief but exceedingly in
teresting account and had doubled the
quarterly dividend of the whisky trust.
James Henry was po far In the rear
that he wouldn't even be mentioned
in the list of entries. At last accounts
George was still runninpr strong with
two new bars to his credit and Jamfa
Henry was trailing along in the dust.
The people in the grand stand say
that It will be a hot finish, whatever
happens. .;â¢'Â¦*
Accordingly I made plain, simple,
strong furniture, using plain woods
and leathers, preserving in every case
the original grain and texture of both
leather and wood, giving them a
change of tone by simple but potent
processes, and at once the whole line
leaped to success. My workshops are
increasing its capacity all the time
and now. I am contemplating -more
than, doubling them.
The ideas I started with have
grown and. multiplied and thousands
now agree with me.
And the j more I thought upon the
THERE ts no such thing as "Mis
sion furniture" in the true sense
of thÂ« word. The tables and
chairs and benches used by the
Ffanclscan fathers in the old
missions were Spanish or Mexican and
generally of the rudest and crudest
class. Here and there a better piece
may be found, as in, the confessional
chair of San Miguel Mission, but. more
often the chairs are clumsy and crude
ly made, as is one of tne old altar
chairs of San Miguel.
. So rude and shabby, did it appear
that when, some years ago. Bishop
Montgomery (now Archbishop) made
his visitation, the* priest removed it
out of doors and put a more modern
chair In its Â«tead. The Bishop, with
'that keen appreciation of true.senti
ment for which he is noted, bade the
priest restore the chair to its wc-nted
place. He said he preferred to see and
use - choir in which, doubtless, often
had rested the sainted Junipero Serra,
than the finest of modern chairs.
The chairs and other furniture made
by me are very different from any of
the furniture used In the missions of
California. I never called it by the
mission name and never suggested that
it should be so called. The reason for
the name, however. I think Is clear.
The old r.Mssion architecture is simple,
'dignified, frankly adapted to its pur
pose, and without frills or furbelows of
any kind. That is exactly the fact in
regard to my furniture. There is no
iveekl:)" for flashy and cheap adorn
ment. Nothing iÂ£ stuck on. It Is sim
ple, dignified and fran-k. And in this
clt-se similarity to the aid mission style
you have the reason for the name. Not,
as so many people have imagined, in
that I was copying the old mission
furniture brought over from Spain, or
from Mexico, or made here under the
direction of the padres.
I have been a furniture maker for
many y^ars and have long wished to
make something of a different class
from that which there was a demand
for. But people were not ready for it.
They were hot educated to care for
puch simple furniture as that which I
had in mind. They wanted showy,
flashy, ornate stuff. I wanted some
thing distinctly American. The more
I thought about it the .more I
came to the conclusion that
we, as a nation, were doing nothing
more than imitating the work of other
nations, living in a different country,
under different conditions within en
tirely different environment from ours.
We had our imitations of classic
and empire and Louis XIII and Louis
the magnificent, and Queen Anne and
a score of other styles, but nothing
original, nothing of our own, nothing
American.
I was assured that furniture, as
everything else, ought to represent
ourselves, our conditions, and that It
was better to begin with a single style
that was our own and adapted to our
environment, conditions and life, than
all the time be Imitating something
else, no matter how excellent that
something else seemed to be In its
own place and time.
Little by little this plain, simple
'style evolved. Itself. Certain prin
ciples formulated themselves and to
these my American furniture must
conform. First of all It must be
honest. There must be no sham
about it. It must be what it proposed
and appeared to b*e. Then It must
be adapted to Its purpose. It must
be plainly and openly a chair, or a
table, or a settee. Then It must be
structural. Ita lines must be simple,
dignified and â¢ those best adapted to
the uses to ! which the made article
was to be placed.
We honor Ruskln and Morris and all
the workers in that line, but our work
Is purely American and we are slavish
followers of no one's ideas. Our aim
Is to teach simplicity of life In all its
manifestations and the success our fur
niture and magazine have attained has
far exceeded our most sanguine expec
tations. The world is now ready for
such teachings.
As to the report that I am about to
establish a co-operative community In
California my plans are not yet for
mulated, though it is true that I am
DURING the past few weeks
Gustav Stickley, accompanied
by his wife and two oldest
daughters, has been traveling
through California. Mr. Stickley is
known throughout the world as "The
Crafttman," for he is the originator
and proprietor of the magazine of
that name devoted to the arts and
crafts movement. Its literary editor
is Miss Irene Sargent. But even more
famous than his magazine is Mr.
Sticldey's furniture, which is known
throughout the world as "the Mis
sion furniture, " which name Mr.
Stickley does not altogether approve
of. It' should be remarked that he
and his methods have so won both
purchasers and dealers that he is the
only furniture dca!er in a large scale
in the world who sets the retail price
upon his wares, and who stamps every
piece of furniture made in his shops
with his own r.anie and trademark.
These things a:id the fact that Mr.
subject the more did I see that furni
ture was but a small branch of it. It
Wai as great and wide as life Itself.
Rightly understood the principles that
I laid down for the making of my
furniture apply to everything In life.
Everything should be simple, digni
fied, frank, honest. So I started my
magazine. "The Craftsman." to propa
gate these Ideas." I did not need. the
magazine to push the sale of my fur
niture. That was already pushing
itself. But I did want t^ show that
plainness and simplicity can be ap
plied to everything in our lives with
out loss of elegance, dignity and
power. Nay, indeed, rather the op
posite. Not the greatest people and
nations are the simplest.
In our work we are Imitating no one.
There Is much more to my plan, such
as ths establishment of a high-class
printing concern, where we shall
endeavor to print books eaual to any
Issued in the new or old world. We
shall then bind them in simple, strong,
beautiful and artistic styles. "We shall
have an Ideal community as far as pos
sible, where music of all kinds, art of
all kinds and craftsmanship of all
kinds will be practiced and taught.
Yes. certainly it Is a big plan, but
this is an age of big things, and noth
ing can be accomplished by attempting
to work on a small scale. We shall
plan large, begin small and work up
to a full achievement or all we have
planned and more.
Here In California you have the ideal
conditions for such a community. Hera
are the climate, the pure air. the scen
ery, the frultfulness of soil, the condi
tions which render outdoor life easy
and possible, the self-dependence that
comes from cbllity to grow almost
everything: you need for food, all thÂ«
things that will go to make such a
community practicable.
And as we plan It. It will be an es
sentially practical affair. There will
be a sterling business basis to every
thing. We shall take pupils and edu
cate them practically, as the old guilds
of Europe used to do, in blacksmithlng.
carpentering, stone masonry, bricklay
ing, silverworking, weaving of all kinds
of textiles, gardening and the like.
Â¦while at the same time giving them ed
ucation in the simpler branches of com
mon knowledse. It will be a kind of
technical school on a broad plan.
If a youth wishes to learn anything
he will be taucht to do the thing by
being required to work on some place
or building Just as if he were a paid
workman. In this way his work will
from the outset mean something to
him. It will have a definite, practical,
commercial value.
This is a matter I have Ions had in
mind. Indeed, ever since I was a your.s
man I have dreamed of It and formu
lated my Ideas. In talking with my
friend here. George Wharton James. I
Hnd we have almost similar ideas. V e
intend to start a community where we
shall live the simple life.
thinking seriously of the matter. I
have a number of tracts of land under
consideration. I expect before long to
purchase one of these and then settle
upon It craftsmen In all the various
lines used In building and furnishing
a house.

(Mary) â There is but one way to break
off a bad habit, and that is to exercise
determination and eternal self-watch
fulness. If you are so nervous that you
cannot refrain from picking at some
thing try, and occupy your hands with
some small object; a fan, handkerchief
or purse will offer relief when In publlo
and fancy work may be relied upon for
home diversion. At the same time ex
ert all the j self-control at your com
mand and try to learn to keep the
hands quiet, or at least make the ner-
envelope the exact size of the large
card and send by mall to those you
desire to receive. When your callers
come you need not feel under any
obligations to serve tea. although such
refreshment would be perfectly cor
rect, accompanied by some dainty dry
biscuit only, and would afford varia
tion from strictly baby talk. Baby,
however. Is the main theme and he is
considered sufficiently attractive to In
sure a pleasant call. As your visitors
will be composed -wholly of U4iÂ«s you
may, with perfect propriety, wear the
handsome tea gown and need not rise
to greet them unless you wish to da
so. Do not permit baby to sleep
with either nurse or mother; the
mother needs refreshing: sleep, which
is simply Impossible if baby is worry
ing beside her. By commencing right
correct habits can be readily estab
lished and every one obtain needful
rest at night.

buttons for the coat part as they are
more convenient and serve as a trim
ming in the bargain.' Treat the sleeves
In the same way. Remove the cuffs
and shirr to match the girdle effect.
The collar should be let alone if- It is
not too "badly worn. Chiffon is rarely
serviceable, bo why not ' buy a pretty
applique lace and dot it here and
there. However, if you really want
the chiffon again, dip it In alcohol and
press. A. pretty double niching
comes by the yard that you might like
and to my absolute knowledge wears
well. White satin can be cleaned eas
ily and well. Buy a 25-cent bottle of
gasoline at any paint shop. Use a soft
cloth and apply the liquid evenly and
generously, and I think you will have
little or no trouble. Clean the satin
before you attempt to change the coat
and Bee that it gets a good sun bath,
for the odor of gasoline is particularly
disagreeable.

HOW TO.JVAX A FLOOR (Mrs.
Henry)â There Is considerable knack
In preparing wax for polishing floors
and unless you are willing to devote
the necessary care to Its preparation
I would suggest that you purchase
the prepared â¢ article, together with
the needed brushes. The weighted
polishing brush is really essential to
thorough work, and saves much fa
tigue. However, here Is a reliable
method for home workers, which
costs very little: Cut one pound of
beeswax in small pieces and melt by
placing the pan containing the wax
in another vessel containing hot wa
ter. Place three pints of best tur
pentine in a large pan, away from the
fire or .lighted gas, and slowly pour
the meited wax into it. stirring rap-
Idly all the time until the Ingredients
are thoroughly blended. Have the
floor perfectly clean and dry, dip a
swab of flannel into the mixture and
rub lengthwise of the wood, taking
one board at a time until the surface
is covered. To polish, cover a block
of wood of " convenient size thickly
with flannel and rub the surface of
the floor until a fine, smooth gloss ap
pears.
GENEVIEVE â Eyebrows. â Scant,
scraggy eyebrows certainly are an af
fliction, but you can strengthen the
growth and greatly improve their ap
pearance by using the following lotion:
Red vaseline, two ounces: tincture of
cantharides, one-eighth ounce; oil of
lavender, fifteen drops; oil of rosemary,
fifteen drops. Mix thoroughly. Apply
to the eyebrows with a tiny toothbrush
once a day until the growth Is suffl
"iently stimulated. Then less often.
This ointment may be used for the eye
lashes too, but be very careful, as it
will Inflame the eyes If any gets Into
them. If you lengthen them by means
of a brow stick, purchase the color that
is a' shade darker than your hair. It
comes in three colors, as you probably
know. Here is a dye that the Moorish
women used to darken both brows and
lashes: Gallnuts, 25 grams; sulphate
of iron, 6 gram*, water, 150 grams.
Boil the gallnuts In the water for
half an hour, strain through fine mus
lin and add to the strained water the
five Brains of the sulphate of iron: Boil
again until the liquor Is reduced to
two-thirds. Apply with a sable pencil
to the eyebrows and. to the edge of the
eyelids at the "roots of the lashes. This
operation should be* repeated three
times. ThÂ« bottle containing; the dye

adornments for the evening slipper,
are also ribbon flowers and buckles. A
pink eatin slipper had a large pink rib
bon rose with a yellow center on each
toe.
Gold and silver cloth and tinsel but
terflies look pretty on the dainty slip
per. The ultra fashionable slipper is
bejeweled in every conceivable design.
A gray suede, for instance, is embroid
ered solid with rhinestones in an ar
tistic floral pattern. Buttons, too, are
a popular feature of decoration, and
are seen in unique designs.
There is an extravagant tendency
along this line in the use of cameos
and miniatures for fastenings.
The black suede slipper has taken
the place of the patent leather to a
great extent. One of the handsomest
designs seen showed a lavender heel
and an immense lavender velvet bow,
fastened with a rhinestone buckle.
Plain blacks are also seen, with
black velvet bows. This style has a
tendency to make the feet appear
smaller than they really are, which
recommends them to the woman
whose feet are large.
For street wear this summer the
Colonial shoe Is to be worn again.
These old-fashioned favorites will

of the shoe at the top of the vamp.
Some of the buckles to be used with
this style of shoe are striking and ex

attachment that converts any oxford
or low shoe Into the most approved
Colonial. This attachment can be
worn with any ordinary shoe laces.
as It has the advantage of hiding
them. It can be easily detached, and
thus makes one pair of shoes serve
for different occasions, changing the
effect with various buckles aa well.
Never -before was there such a be
wildering choice among shoes for
housewear, which combine comfort
and beauty. The Japanese style of
negligee, which Is so much affected at
present for hours of ease, has made
Oriental footwear popular. The shoe
girl who possesses odds and ends of
Bilk crepes, or other Oriental fabrics,
has them made Into toilette slippers
for her boudoir. This toilette slipper
Is the handiest thing to slip pn for
bathroom wear, as It simply has a
pocket for the toe. Some of them are
of quilted satin with a niching of rib
bon around the "pocket," others are
of plain satin with or without high
heels. \
The sandal idea ia in great favor for
boudoir wear. These are desirable;
for Grecian costumes, and numerous
designs are shown in the arrangement
of ribbons. A preference is had for
loose ribbons which leave an oppor
tunity of changing the effect as de
sired.
Fur trimmed Juliets are always
popular for housewear. Another shoe
built on the same plan is shown in
laced design with ribbons attached,
which are fastened around large but
tons In front. â¢ â¢
Still another shoe of this order Is a
vousnesa as Inconspicuous aa possible.
A woman who* keeps In a constant

and at the same time avoid anything
which excites or overfatlguea.

MEN WHOM THE MIKADO SEEKS TO KEEP OFF FIRING LINE
The celebration of, the. first -ehrlst
mas after the organization of the
school was one which will be lone re-
of its kind to be established in Alaska.
The teaching of this school Jn the
far north is not this young man's first
experience in the instruction of boys
and young men. Trevious to his. ap
pointment, four years ago, Mr. Moses
had charge of the boys' department of
the Young Men's Christian Association
of Providence, Rhode 'Island, -and dur
ing the time that the juvenile classes
of that institution were under his direc
tion he learned much that was of value
to him in hia new work regarding the
Instruction of young people. H. L. Cal
der, a member of the Young Men's
Christian Association of -Providence,
not long ago received a letter from F.
F. Merritt, the United States Commis
sioner at St. Michael,- describing the
school and the Commissioner spoke in
the "highest terms of the work accom
plished by the former director of the
Y. M. C. A., and so highly did the resi
dents of St. Michael appreciate the vol
untary services of Mr. Moses that they
recently presented him with a hand
some Masonic, charm as a token of their
regard. , , .
membered in St. Michael. It was givtsn
by the pupils of thÂ» school and was the
first entertainment ever given In the
town by children and young people.
The programme was arranged by Mr.
Moses, who endeavored, as nearly as
possible, to follow the customs, of the
New England country school. The pro
gramme consi'sted of Christmas carols,
songs and recitations by the white chil-
a *line as last year though every <jne
said that the entertainment this year
was twice as good as the flrst onel
"The boys each received a 'parka' (a
fur jacket or blouse, cut something i:i
the shape of a man's overshirt), two
pairs of socks and a bag of candy, and
the girls received a waist, a sewing bag
and a bag of candy each. I also gave
each boy and girl a fifty-pound sack
of flour. Instead of delivering the flour
as I did last year, I had it at the tree
and after the entertainment I gave it
to them to carry home."
Immediately after the New Year the
school reopened and at the last account
there was talk of erecting a school
house in St. Michael for the accommo
dation of the increasing classes. So
popular has Mr. Moses become through
his work in the school that no event,
whether social or otherwise, is consid
ered a success unless "Mr. Frank," as
the young teacher is lovingly called b/
his pupils, is present. And he has'weil
deserved the respect and love which
hs has won, for he has successfully
carried out a great work without ask
ing any reward for his services and
with no Incentive except the wish to
better the condition of the young peo
ple of St. Michael.
half-breed children, the most of whom
knew only their own dialect' and just
enough English "to swear in," and the
white children were in much the same
condition except where their parents
bad instructed them in the letters of
the alphabet and irÂ» .simple arithmetic.
After several months he proposed to
some of the most influential of iha
residents of St. Michael that they or
ganize a school and send to San Fran
cisco for a teacher. He was informed
that an effort had already been made
to establish some kind of a school, bul
that no one cared to come so far from
civilization for the salary that the rpo
ple of St. Michael were able to offer.
After considering the question for some
time Mr. Moses volunteered to try and
organize a school, stipulating, however,
that if successful, his services as teat-n
er should be rendered without cost to
the town, as he, being in the service
of the Government, could not accept
any other position with a salary at
tached. His proposal was immediately
accepted and the self-apjiointed in
structor at once set to work among the
children and young folks of the town,
and soon had the names of twenty or
more enrolled in the flrst class.
The first difficulty which presented it
self to the young registrar after the
organization of the class was that of
obtaining a place large enough for a
classroom, and for a time it seemed
as though the lack of a suitable room
or hall would prove a bar to the enter
prise; but after some discussion per
mission was granted Mr.* Moses by the
Judge at St. Michael to use the court
room, and so in the judicial hall of
the town was opened the first school
Another thing which Mr. Moses has
Introduced in the school is the system
atic study of practical gymnastics, in
which both the white and half-breed
children take great interest, and the
commander of the garrison at St.
Michael, realizing the value ef the
work undertaken by the volunteer in
structor, has very- kindly placed the
military gymnasium at the disposal of
the schooL Since they have had access
to the proper apparatus for physical de
velopment Mr. Moses' pupils have be
come very proficient in all kinds ol
gymnastic exercises.
When Mr. Moses first arrived at St.
Michael he was touched by the ex
treme ignorance of the "native and
on the shore of Norton Sound, has
been established the first "school for
the education of white and half-breed
children*to be organized, in that far
away. Ice-bound territory, and that the
Institution has proven a is due
to the untiring efforts and unselfish
devotion of Franklin Moses, the regis
trar of the United States Land Office
at St. Michael. The school was organ
ized with only twenty pupils and now,
In less, than two years, the membership
has grown to nearly one hundred.
Many of the half-breed pupils, who,
when they first entered the school, did
not know one letter of the alphabet
from another, can now read and write,
and shave acquired some knowledge of
arithmetic. )
The difficulties which confronted Mr.
Moses when he began his woTk may
bs better imagined than described, es
pecially when it is remembered that
in the beginning he knew nothing of
the native tongue, and many of the
halt-breed children were familiar with
but few words of English. - Under
these conditions the work of the self
appointed teacher was difficult in the
extreme, but one by one the obstacles
v.ere overcome, and the number of pu
pils increased, until, at the present
time, the students are not only in
structed in^reading, writing and arith
metic, but also study the Scriptures
and lately they haye taken up simple
choral music.
IN the little town of St.. Michael, the
headquarters c-f the military reser
vation of Alaska, which is situated
dren and a number of simple choruses
by the half-breeds and natives. After
the entertainment the latter enjoyed a
bountiful Christmas dinner prepared by
e number of the officers' wives and
ladles of the town, and in the evening
there was the regulation Christmas
tree, from which a Santa Claus in seal
Bkins distributed gifts to the pupils of
the school.
Mr. Moses opened the school for the
flrst time In November, 1902.' and It was
closed for the first vacation in May.
1903. In less than seven months Mr.
Moses had taught all his pupils to read
at sight and many of them were al
ready learning to write. The difficulty
of teaching the Ignorant natives the
letters of the alphabet was almost in
credible, it being necessary to write
each letter on the board and then re
peat It over and over until, parrot
like, they had learned it by heart. The
' white children, of course, advanced
more rapidly than the natives and
half-breeds and before long It was
found advisable to divide the school
Into three classes of white children,
half-breeds and natives, and then, in
deed, was the volunteer teacher kept
busy. . .
After a summer vacation of four
months the school was reopened in
September, 1903, and the children ad
vwiced steadily until the Christmas
holidays once more interrupted the
work. The celebration of* the second
Christmas was much like the flrst ex
cept that the programme rendered by
the pupils of the school was far more
elaborate, Including recitations, sing
ing (both solo and choral), gymnastic
exercises by the boys and a fancy drill
by the girls, who executed a number of
pretty figures.
In a letter to a friend in Oakland.
Cal., Mr. Moses gives the following ac
count of the Christmas celebration:
"Christmas has come and gone once

upon us would be 19,000 times more In

fun. The earth would melt and vapo
rize like a srto\vfiE.ke sucked into the
open door of a furnace.
As much as the sun exceeds the
earth, so much Canopus exceeds the
sun. In each case the multiplicator is
a million. A single unit stands for the
earth; a million units represent the
sun; a million times a million units
denote Canopus. Yet Canopus is also
a sun; at least we do not know what
else to call it. But what a sun!
It will be observed that the compari
son between the sun and the earth i3
based on their relative size, or volume,
while for the sun and CanoDUs it re
lates to their mass, or quantity of mat
ter. This, however, does not essentially
uffect the stated inequality. Another
term for mass, in everyday life, is
Â¦weight. We say that two bodies which
th" same are equal in mass. It
follow?, then, that Canopus placed in
one s'-ale of a balance would lift a mil
lion suns piled together In the other

is greater than the mean destiny of tho

When you have succeeded, then, in
forming a definite mental picture of
the great globe of the sun, you are
ready for the final flight of imagina

based upon authentic astronomical
data, demands that you make if you
hope to understand the scale on
which this universe is built. These
ten v.ords sketch the magnitude of the
conception now required of you;
"Canopus is a million times more
massive than the sun."
In estimating th2 relative magni

of comparison is necessarily the earth.

Between the dial ar.d the Palace of

buildings. The central one, which is
14 feet square at the base and 14 feet
to the cornice line, is of Grecian archi

hemisphere 12 feet in diameter. Th*
ground color of this roof Is azure; It Is
dotted with stars and marked with
meridians, to represent the heavens. In
this building Is the mechanism that

deep tones that can be heard all over
the exposition grounds. And It Is at
the first stroke of the bell that the
door swings open, revealing the clock

A companion structure stands on the

is an immense hour glass that turns
automatically every hour.

a case their odor would be noticeable

The process is analogous to the color-
Ing of water in a glas3, for instance.
by a drop of red Ink, which takes place
gradually In a similar way. Oil and
water do not vibrate harmoniously,
therefore they do not mix, eta All the
assertions made here are but the logical
deductions following the theories and
opinions of the different authorities of
every age. which are in accordance with
the experiences and observations of
exact science.
Radio activity, according to t&a fore
going, would then be but a modification
of solar energy, which, including its
accompanying substratum of subtle
substance in the form of ether or mat
ter in the fourth state, penetrates tÂ«r
restlal bodies, whereby this energy,
this form of motion. Is changed, accord
ing to existing conditions, into light,
heat, electricity, etc At the same time,
as is but natural. Its material sub
stratum, the ether, is likewise trans
formed. And as the visible solar rays

fecting the latter in the least, reappear

These modified rays, as they pass
through other bodies near by, oscillate
for a time with the atomlo â¢'TTfmÂ». of
those bodies whereby their molecular
vibrations are changed and the differ
ent unexplained effects and phenomena
are produced of temporary fluores
cence, of temporary, coloring glass
blue, brown,- green, according to Its
constitution, etc
And in order to follow up these ar
guments to their legitimate ultimate
conclusions we might consider the sun
Itself as a center and focus, on which
the rays of energy of still higher and
invisible centers are concentrated and
modified, appearing on . our sun as
luminous rays and penetrating from
there our planetary system as rays of
life-electricity. Verbum sat sapient!.
rent of force necessarily c-jnslst of
three rays. Modern scienca cannot
contradict this assertion, as it has been
found that Roentgen rays, as well as
radium rays, consist Indeed of three
distinct , and , different rays of energy
(Professor Crookes, etc.). (One of these
rays Is propelling and positive, the sec
ond is negative, enveloping and en
circling the first one, while the third"
encircles both the others and keeps
them, so to speak, in equilibrium. Their
respective velocities are as 1-2-S.) The
finer the substance, the greater the
force, or its inherent velocity.
It Is clear that the finest and most
rapid of the substances filling the uni
verse penetrates the easiest and quasi
unimpeded the denser matter, while
the atoms of the more substantial
ethers have to force their way through
the interstices of the molecules and
their dynaspheres in spiral wavea, os
cillating temporarily with the atoms
of the molecule of denser matter, part
ly changing their velocities and thus
determining the properties of such
matter: chemical, | thermal, electrical,
etc. This, 1 as well as the fact that ths
atom of even the finest substance is
composed "of atomic triplets, each of
which consists again of triplets, etc.,
ad innnitum, tends to show that
matter is .Infinitely â¢ divisible, as
many learned men of' past centuries
have contended (Schoppenbauer. Male
branche, et alii) and as several intui
tive authorities of our > present day
(Professor Crookes,^ Lodge, etc) are
forced to recognize in consequence of
the facts disclosed by radio-activity..
The kinetic gas theory, according to
which the 'gas particles shoot "through
space in straight Hies and v in wild
confusion, rebounding, from, confining
walls without diminution of velocity or
force, is contradictory of rJl scientific
experience. If a small quantity of
powder is burned in a room, it takes
considerable time before the gases de
veloped by the explosion have spread
through the whole room; for, accord-
Ing to what has been said so far. the
gases have to force themselves in
spiral waves through the' interstices of
the molecules of â¢ the" air, with which
they oscillate sympathetically for a
time; but never are these gas particles
THE world's foremost searchers
after the ultimate secrets of the
universe are at present devot
ing themselves to the studies of
the newly discovered element,
rtdiam, and the Interest in this re
markable metal is growing day by day,
especially In scientific circles, as the
phenomena observed at the investiga
tions are not only in contradiction of
our generally accepted ideas about
light and energy, out also seem to
upset some cf the fundamental laws of
science as hitherto formulated.
These Investigations, according to
the assurances of the authorities in
terested in the subject, were exceed
ingly thorough and exhaustive, having
been conducted and controlled with
painstaking care, and the results
which the several competent investi
gators arrived at were the same In
nearly every instance, bo that any pos
sibility of a mistake is simply out of
question. The absolute facts about the
metal and its properties are, therefore,
firmly established. On the other hand,
the fundamental laws of our scientific
researches do not permit of any ex
ceptions, nor of any contradictions;
they are either absolutely correct and
unconditionally valid, or they are er
roneous.
First of all, it is an established fact
that the rays projected continually by
this strange metal not only produce
chemical action, but they also give off
heat and energy "in enormous quanti
ties." It is furthermore established
that particles of exceedingly fine mat
ter, so-called electrons, are thrown off
with great vehemence and velocity,
forming the necessary substratum ' of
the said energyâ which is quite in ac
cordance with scientific logic, for
â¢force" without "matter" is inconceiv
able and "motion" is not possible with
out "something" which is moved. But
on the other hand it is found that ra
dium emits its rays without chemical
transformation, combustion or virtu
ally any change whatever, so that no
perceptible loss of weight takes place
< Crookes). or if such should really be
the cage the loss consists only in an in
finitesimal quantity and in mluions
and billions of years (Lord Kelvin,
professor Becquerel, etc), which is in
no proportion whatever to the "enor
mous quantities" of force and heat
proceeding from the metal, whereby no
less than 7,200,000 electrons per minute
are projected into spac* from a very
eiudl surface Since, however, force
is a system in a state of Intrinsic mo
tion, as a vortex ring, a constellation
of atoms in orbital motion. . :
On the basis of tl\is assumption
Professor Hertz of Bonn already, years
.ago made certain experiments with
a view to split the molecule by
"resonance" (sound) vibration; but
even with a million vibrations a sec
ond he failed. But another investi
gator with proper - appliances suc
ceeded to tear the molecule asunder
with only 42,800 vibrations a second,
and he established that every moecule
of matter, be it solid, fluid, gaseous
or etheric, etc, consisted of atomic
triplets, which inside of ..their -own
special â¢ surrounding atmosphere, their
so-called, "dynasphere" , of still finer,
matter, turned around each other,
while revolving around a neutral cen
ter ' (the .'' second Â¦ constituent ' of ' the
molecule revolving around the first,
and the ' third around the first and
secondrso that their respective veloci
ties are as 1:2:8). Superficially the
.three â¢constituents'* of, a, molecule â¢ of
solid matter would themselves /consist
of atoms of fluid matter, the triplets
of fluid' matter would* consist* of gase
ous atoms and gaseous matter of
etheric atoms, etc, up to the .finest
substance.
The explanation of a phenomenon
tends 'to -reducing its genesis, to its
simplest beginnings and to Its earliest
forms.,. Modern science commences
with an atom of solid matter, but
solidity as , postulated is no real fact
at all In nature. In the sense in which
it is ascribed . to . the atom, according
to the foregoing and as we know it by
experience, "solidity" is not the
simplest but on the contrary the most
complicated phase of material con
sistency. The denser the matter, the
more constellations of atoms are
presseU together in the molecule and
the smaller are the circles described,
by the constellations', whereby, how
ever, neither their Inherent force, nor.
the quantity of matter in the aggre
gate is decreased, in the least. For
matter and force are inseparable and
therefore all the force Inherent In 'all
the different constellations of atoms,
of which the molecule of solid matter
consists, must be concentrated there
and latent, which again conforms
with experience, for where would the
immense amount, of energy come
from which is developed at the ex
plosion of gunpowder or dynamite,
since force cannoL.be created but only
transformed, if it had not been press
ed into the molecule during its forma
tion and been held there?. It is true,
there is a theorem according to which
energy is dissipated. in the proportion
in which 'matter Is concentrated,
"Evolution is an integration of matter
and~, concomitant . dissipation of mo
tion (Synthetic Philosophy; first prin
ciples. H. Spencer)* 'But this theorem
would have to ba modified, for "force"
i can not be separated from, its sub
stratum "matter," and It; gets 'stored
up 'in the molecule ,as the atoms rof
subtle ether group themselves to" form
denser" matter: j An ratom of oxygen
and'the two atoms of hydrogen form
ing together an atom of water retain
their respective latent force and prop
erties, no matter how often we may
. decompose the water into these con
stituents. - -
As there are innumerable different
states or grades of solid, fluid, gaseous,
etc., \ bodies, so are the possibilities in
finite of different combinations of ag
gregates of atomic constellations. The
results which we get in calculating the
number of atomic minima constituting;
the molecule of different kinds of mat
ter and of the respective velocities of
those atoms . l are . inconceivable,* it is
true, but our incapacity to comprehend
a thing is no proof of Its impossibility.
As every molecule of; matter consists,
of atomic triplets, so must every cur-
stances. This we can see with oun
eyes or we can prove it. But likewise
there are a great number of different
kinds of ether, according to the opin
ion of many of o-ur modern and an
cient men of learning â and scientific
analogy and logic justify such assump
tionâdifferent varieties of subtle par
ticles of ether or of matter In the
fourth state, underlying as substratum
the different kinds and modifications
of force such as "light," "heat," "elec
tricity." "magnetism," etc. Modern
scientists in general declare all these
forces as different vibrations or differ
ent "forms of motion" of one and the
same ether. But other authorities do
not indorse this theory. For vibra
tions or "undulatory motion" of ether
In ether is Inconceivable without a
vacuum somewhere.
It is, however, a scientific axiom that
there is no vacuum in space which is
pervaded by the universal ether and,
therefore, no undulatory motion of
ether is possible in this Its own me
dium. *
On the strength of these arguments
the undulatory theory of light is re
jected as erroneous by many authori
ties, who hold that a subtle mind of
ether particles are projected from the
sun with the 'known velocity, which,
after traveling through space filled
with a still finer kind of ether, pene
trating the much denser medium of
terrestrial air reach our earth, to form
the different modifications of solar en
ergyâlight, heat, magnetism, electrio
lty, etc, whereby , the material sub
stratum of solar 1 energy ; Is , likewise
modified, so that a special and differ
ent ether serves these different forces
each as substratum. No valid objec
tion can be raised against this theory,
all the less as modern science has al
ready . recognized that . there Â¦ !s a' cer
tain kind of subtle' ether, "elections,*!
underlying the Roentgen raysâ a modi.
flcatlon of electricityâ as substratum,
and even electricity Itself has been.de
clared to be atomic, vis.: "matter"
(Tesla, Lodge. L. "Wright, eta).
Besides this,* Professor Haeckel tells
us: "The whole of the wonderful world
of forms surrounding and animating
our globe consists ultimately of con
densed sunlight" (Weltraetsel, page
217). But a planet of granite and iron
cannot be formed solely of condensed
"forms of motion"; it must be "mat
ter," however fine originally, con
densed, as steam forms water and wa
ter ice.
Modern science inclines more and
more to the opinion that the molecule
and matter can neither be created nor
destroyed these established facts about
radium are "in obvious contradiction
of the law of the conservation of ener
gy" (Lord Kelvin) and it Is this ques
tion about the origin of the "force and
matter" continually streaming from
radium without apparent loss of
weight which is puzzling the scientists.
To attempt <in explanation and to try
to solve the riddle is the object of this
article. :.& .. Â¦Â¦Â¦ . . 4e . : .
It goes without . saying, as we have
remarked before, that no force can
manifest Itself without its necessary
6ubstratum of matter, however fine.
Contact Is the "sine qua non" of effect
and contact can only take place be
tween "matter" and "matter." A solid
body, for instance a billiard ball, Is set
in motion by another solid body, a sec
ond ball, pressing against the first ball
by "mechanical force" with "solid"
matter as substratum. A wheel is
turned by water In motion by "water
force" with "fluid" matter as sub
stratum. In stagnant water the wheel
does not turn, for no manifestation of
force Is possible without motion. A
steam engine is driven by "steam
force" with "gaseous" matter as sub
stratum. Without motion, without the
continuous supply of new steam, no
manifestation of steamforce is con
ceivable. So far everything Is clear
and fully agrees with our modern
ideas because there Is no difficulty for
us to experiment with matter In these
three states to Investigate the effects
physically and ' to establish; scientifi
cally the causes producing these ef
fects. ;1?
But when It comes to radium, to
Roentgen rays and radiant matter gen
erally, we have to confess our In
ability to give a satisfactory explana
tion of a number of phenomena and
manifestations of such forces, of
which so-called "electrons" or matter
in the "fourth state" (Faraday,
Crookes) forms the I material sub
stratum. For neither our physical
senses nor our Instruments nor meth
ods are adequate for the investigation
of the "Invisible" and the "imponder
able." It Is true we have invented a
name for this subtle substance In the
fourth state of matter "ether"; but
of its nature we have not the faintest
idea. Professor Haeckel in hi* "un
solved" World riddles (Weltraetsel)
describes this ether as "formless
Jelly"; but this Is, in the opinion of a
number of competent authorities, not
only an arbltary assumption bu It
does not in the least suffice to give an
explanation of even the simplest phe
nomena.
As there are innumerable kinds of
solid bodies, bo tiuxe ar* numberless

give the poor girl a chance.** A lafiy
of my acquaintance says that sitting
out a Wagnerlan opera seems to her
like listening to a singer accompanied
by four orchestras playing different
tunes at the same time. As I have
caid, there are times when Wagner
carries me along with him, when I
exult in the crash and whirl of his
contending harmonies. But, alas, there
are those other moods â those after-din
ner moods â when my desire Is for
something distinctly resembling a tuns.
Still, there are' other composers of
grand opera besides Wagner. I grant,
with the late Heir Wagner, that so
far as mus^c is concerned, opera can
supply us with all we can need.
But It was also Wagner's argument
that grand opera could supply us with
acting, and there I am compelled to
disagree with him. Wagner thought
that the arts of acting and singing
could be combined. I have seen artists
.-the great man had trained himself. As
singers they left nothing io be desired,
but the acting in grand opera has
never yet Impressed me. Wagner
never succeeded in avoiding the oper
atic convention, and nobody else ever
will. When the operatic lover meets his
sweetheart he puts her In a corner and,

times when I feel unequal to following
three distinct themes at' one and the

Wagnerian enthusiast to me, "the cor
net has jiow the Brurnhilda motive."
It seems to me in my then state of de
pravity as if the cornet had even more
than this the matter with him. "The
second violins," continues the Wagner
ian enthusiast, "are carrying on the
"Wotan theme." That they are "carry-
Ing on" goes without saying; the play
ers* faces are streaming with perspira
tion. "The brass." explains my friend
â his object is to cultivate my ear â "Is
accompanying the singers." I should
have said, drowning them- There are
occ&eions when I can rave about Wag
ner with the beft of them. High-class
xaoods come to all of us. The difference
between the really class man and us
commonplace workaday men is the dif
ference between, say. the eagle and the
barnyard chicken. I am the barnyard
chicken. I have my wings. There are
ecstatic moments when I feel I want to
spurn the 6ordid earth and soar Into the
realms of art. I do fly a little, but my
body Is heavy, and I only get as far as
the fence. After a while I find It
lonesome Elttlng on the fence, and I hop
down again among my fellows. Listen

keep my seat watching the unequal

EMPEROR WILLIAM HOSTILE.
Owing to the opposition of Emperor
William, which is fully shared by the
Empress Augusta Victoria, no so-call
ed society women have Identified them
selves prominently with the . woman's
movement in Germany. Court leaders
anfd royalties' are conspicuously missing
from all affairs connected with It. It
is possible, however, that the wives of
a few Cabinet Ministers, perhaps even
Countess von" Bulow, the spouse of the
Imperial Chancellor, 1 will dare to brook
imperial scowls by entertaining the
delegates to the Berlin congress at gar-,
den parties or evening receptions. The
most pretentious social. function so far
planned, is a reception " at the Berlin
City" Hall, which will be tendered 'by
the municipality as a welcome to! the

Many women writers ffSr the Paris
papers have taken up the subject and
every day they rail at the famous
singer. Some of them have gone so far
as to assert that "a woman is not a
woman until she is 30, and is still young
at 40."
â¢ "You cannot understand how I have
struggled -during the last ten years.
Here I am already an old woman at
40. when others at that age still retain
their youthful appearance. In my case
it is the penalty of an uphill struggle."
The Paris editors were greatly aston
ished at Mme. Calve's words, and said
so with much emphasis. Some of them
hint that- the prima donna should at
least have too mttjch pride to admit that
she has become a "nice old lady" at
her youthful age.
Her â¢ Candor.
PARIS, June 11.â Several of the Paris
papers, especially those that are de
voted to women and womanly things,
have wasted much ink in the last few
days in taking to task Mme. Emma

represented at the congress. Japanese,
Siamese and Indian women are already
booked as delegates, and China and
Korea will be represented by native
women residents in Europe. America
will occupy the chief place among the
foreign delegations, because it has been
the pioneer in woman's progress and
because Susan B. Anthony, the "grand
old lady" of the movement all over the
wdrld, has promised to honor the con
clave with her presence. Mrs. May
Wright Sewall of Indiana, in her ca
pacity of president of the International
Council of Women, will wield th(*gavel
at all general sessions of the congress.
Another special honor will be paid to
the United States, when the congress
devotes- an entire evening to the dis
cussion of the theories of Mrs. Char
lotte Perkins Stetson of New York,
while .Dr. Anna Shaw, the famous
American woman preacher, has been
invited to introduce to Germany the
innovation of a sermon from a woman
âthe first of its kind that the Father
land will ever have heard.
Because the woman's movement has
had such an uphil! flght In Germany,
where man is everything and his bet
ter half almost nothing, . few leaders
have been developed who enjoy reputa-.
tions extending beyond the frontiers of
their own country. Yet such names as
Frau Stritt, Frau Dr. Ichenhaeuser,
Frau Hedwlg Heyl. Fraulein Alice
Salomon, Fraulein Helene Lange, Frau
Anna Edinger and Fraulein Olgo von
Beschwitz, who will all be active lead
ers of various departments of the com
ing congress, are well known through
out most European countries as vigor
ous and relentless workers in their
chosen field. That German women
have a difficult struggle to gain the
headway women have made elsewhere
may be comprehended from the fact
that only a few years ago were they
able to secure the repeal of a law bar
ring "women, children and lunatics
from attending meetings where political
subjects are under discussion." Since
the smashing of that medieval barrier,
the cause has prospered, but very slow

politically and may not hold public of

however, have made the experiment of
having women factory inspectors and
poor law administrators, and they may

The sessions of the congress, which
will be . held morning, afternoon and
evening. for six days,. will occur in the
spacious halls of the famous Philhar
monic concert building, which has a
total seating capacity of more than 10,- ,
000. The sessions are divided, of course,
into sectional programmes, so that dis
cussions upon various topics will pro
ceed simultaneously in various parts of
the. congress- hall. Four hundred ad
dresses are already scheduled for de
livery. ; English, French and German
will be the official languages of the
conclave,- that language, being used
upon each occasion 'which seems mostf
appropriate.

congress will be a "peace demonstra

At present it would be rash to

of government.
ST. PETERSBURG. June 1Lâ Great
indignation is expressed here at the
malversation of the funds of the Red
Cross Society.
Numbers of impecunious aristocrats,
Â¦women of the court and officers of the
guards, who are favorites in high cir
cles, have been appointed to sinecures
at extravagant salaries, amounting in
Feme cases to thousana or pounds per
annum.
This Etate of affairs is all the more
deplorable as there are plenty of com
petent organizers willing to do the
Â¦work for nothing.
The most sensational case, 6ays the
Revolutionaia RuEsia. is that of Gen
eral Schwedoff, a member of the St.
Petersburg committee, who "borrowed"
5500,000 from the funds of the society
in order to gamble on the Stock Ex
change. His speculations being unsuc
cessful, his deficit became manifest.
The Czarina, however, herself paid the
missing sum so as to avoid a public
scandal and save the general, who is a
special favorite at court. General
Shwedcff was even retained as a mem
ber of the committee, but precautions
were taken to prevent further "bor
rowing" operations.
Similar scandals occurred in Moscow,
where a Prince Galitzln und & Count
Lanaky kept money collected from the
Red Cross for themselves. Count Lan-
Eky refuses to hand over either the
money or the subscription list, while
the Prince has paid up $500, but keeps
back the list.
These occurrences have not failed to
arouse the suspicions of the public, and
many wealthy and charitable people
now refuse to give any money to the
society.
High Officials of the Government Are
Accused of Misappropriating
War Funds.
RUSSIA'S RED CROSS
IN MIDST OF SCANDAL
The Kaiser, like German men of all
ranks, holds fast to the German tradi
tion that woman's sphere should â¢ be
limited to the activities of the "haus
frau" and that she has no right to mix
herself in affairs beyond the realm of
the three German K's â kinder, kueche
and kirche (children, kitchen and
church). No imperial welcome there
fore will await the 4000 women from
all parts of the world who will attend
the congress as delegates of "organized
womanhood In all climes. Indeed, it
will be a miracle if the congress ad
journs without adopting resolutions
strongly savormg of censure of the
strenuous monarch for his old-fash
ioned ideas about women's rights.
GERMAN WOMEN ACTIVE. *
The organization of the congress has
been effected by the National Council
of German Women and the tre
mendous work it has involved has
rested largely upon the shoulders of
Frau Marie Strlt of Dresden, president
of the council, and Frau Dr. Eliza
Ichenhaeuser, secretary general of the
congress. The programme of the con
gress covers practically every subject

LONDON'. June 11. â There Is much
disappointment that the Duchess of
Roxburghe is not going to play any
conspicuous part in society during the
ccmirg season. Those who were aware
that she had abandoned the idea of
acquiring a permanent town residence
thought she would at least secure a
house for the season. She will not be
seen much in London during June, as
her time will be fully occupied super
intending the extensive alterations she
is going to carry out at Floors Castle.
In spite of the protestations of the
Dowager Duchess, she is pulling the
place to pieces and means to convert
it into a residence more in keeping with
American ideas. Like the Duchess of
Manchester with reg: - ! to Kylemore

ers of such placet had expected a

they demand for the season. The

ing. Their presence there appears to
be an attraction for rich Americans.
Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Field Clapp of
St. Louis have taken a house on Cur
zon s'treet for the season. They will
be Joined there later on by Mr. Clapp'a
sister, Mrs. Cromwell Webb of Wash

first time made the acquaintance of
English society.
There appears to be a great run of
country mansions also thl3 season-
Mr, and Mrs. Joseph Priestley Button
of Philadelphia have taken Claybrooke
Hall, near Rugby. It has been suf
fering from neglect for a number of
years and it will cost at least $50,000
to put it into decent, habitable repair.
It is an old-fashioned country place,
but there is plenty of hunting and fish
ing in the immediate neighborhood.
Mr. and Mrs.' Button will have tor
near neighbors Mr. and Mrs.
Loney of New York, who have recent
ly acquired Wilioughby Hall. The
Loneys lead a rather retired life, and,
although they have every facility for
entertaining, they have not shown any
disposition to do so. Mr. Loney made
his money in Wall street, but since he
has settled in England he has given
his neighbors the idea that he does not
care for the excitement of city life.
There is a farm attached to Wlllough
by Hall, where he. cultivates the vege
tables necessary for 'Â¦ the household.
FLAT-HUNTING THE RAGE.
The first thins the girl did after re
ceiving her first $5000 was to buy a
motor car; the second to fall in love
with her chauffeur, and the third, to
announce her determination to marry
him. At such a wild idea her pa
rents were thunderstruck and from
storming and arguing have taken to
pleading with her. They begged her
to wait one month to see if she would
still be of the same mind then. To
this she consented, but immediately
this time had elapsed she declared
that she was still determined to con
tract a marriage with her chauffeur.
Almost in despair, her parents havÂ»
Implored her to wait three months be
fore taking any further steps and to
this she has unwillingly agreed. Two
months of this time has already gone
by and with each day the distress of
the parents increases.
The girl's father has asked the
chauffeur to accept $50,000 cash down
instead of marrying his daughter, who
always has been to him as the apple
of his eye, but the chauffeur refuses
point blank. In making this decision
he may be influenced by the knowl
edge that if the father does not help
them during his lifetime the girl will
have $5000 a year and must come Into
at least $75,000 later on when her
father dies.
London society is curious to see what
will be the dramatic denouement of a
strange infatuation on the part of one
of the richest and most popular girls In
London society. Her father and
mother have a big, beautiful house in
Grosvenor place and entertain there on
a scale of great magnificence. On the*
coming of age of* this glH a few* months
since there were great rejoicings. On
this auspicious occasion the fond father
settled on her an allowance of $5000 a
year.

last year. On his return to London he
met her again, and in spite of the pro
testations of his mother he paid her
marked attention^ He nas a constant
visitor at the hotel where she stayed
with her mother and brother, and alto
gether entertained the young lady and
her family most generously, with boxes
at the best theaters and suppers at the
most fashionable restaurants. His
name, in fact, became coupled with
that of the young lady, who i3 ths
daughter of a wealthy Wall-street
man, to such an extent that the Coun
tess of "Warwick had to interfere a sec
ond time, but In spite of all maternal
remonstrances the young lord persisted
In keeping up the acquaintance. So he
is off to New York, where the heiress
has already gone, and the nobleman's
friends will not be surprised to v --r
the announcement of his engagement.

to his affection he caused his coach

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE . 12, 1901.
ECHOES FROM THE LODGE ROOM
18John W. Thompson, who was here as
a member of the "Ben Hur" company,
opines that San Francisco is losing its
Bohemia. "I found many of my old
friends gone," he said to the New York
Dramatic News, "and their -peaces
taken by gentlemen of more^ pro
nounced business ability. In fact, the
actors and newspaper men who used to
delight in being regarded as Bohemians
are things of the past. Money rules
the most everywhere and the stage and
newspaper office are no exception to
the rule. Do I find fault with this
state of affairs? . Not a bit of it.
Without money a man is of little con
sequence anywhere, and it Is a sign of
progress when we see writers and
actors getting into line and saving in
stead of spending. There may not be
the same charm about the profession
of writer or actor, ,but facts are facts,
and the commercial spirit dominates
the artistic, -which in my opinion Is of
much advantage to the latter."
In an interview Joseph Jefferson re
cently reiterated his objections to an
endowed or national theater. The
question of securing the best players
he regarded as the^chief obstacle. On
this point he delivered himself thus:
"A good actor usually has the money
he needs to make artistic productions.
He has a desire, natural enough and
very human, of being at -the head of the
enterprise. Why should he surrender
this privilege and the profits and glory
of his. work to go with a number of
others into a general group *of play
ers?*It would also be difficult for an
actor who has dominated his own en
tertainments to subject himself to the
rule of 'another stage director. Then.
GOSSIP ABOUT FOLK

IN THE MI3IIC WORLD
Mrs. Leslie Carter, in David Belas
co's new play "Du Barry," promises to
break box-office records at the Grand
Opera-house. The advance sale of seats
for the opening week, commencing to
morrow evening, presages a crowded
house at each performance. Including
the Wednesday and Saturday matinees.
Since her last appearance here, three
years ago, when she played "Zaza" at
the Columbia Theater, Mrs. Carter is
said to have continued the advance
ment that has been so remarkable ever
since her debut. The supporting com
pany Includes a number of well-known
clever people.
E. IT. Sothern's vehicle this year is
"The Proud Prince," by Justin Hunt
ly McCarthy, author of "If I Were
King," and the new play is said to be
superior In every element of dramatic
strength to its predecessor in the Soth
ern reportoire. Mr. Sothern's engage
ment, commencing to-morrow evening
at the Columbia Theater, will be his
last in this city as an individual star,
as he plays Shakespeare next season
with Julia Marlowe.
"Charley's Aunt," than which no
funnier farce was ever written, will be
the Alcazar's offering this week. It is
one of the very few English laugh
makers that has retained popularity
in this country.
"Secret Service," William Gillette's
great war drama, will be started on a
week's run this evening at the Cali
fornia Theater by the Oliver Morosco
Company, .an organization 'which has
already won strong local favoritism.
At the Central Theater to-morrow
night there will be a revival of Bouci
cault's time-honored drama of the
ante-bellum South, "The Octoroon."

too, he would spend most of the time In
one place, playing to a single city, and
you know an actor finds satisfaction
and pleasure in going from place to
place, meeting many people and hear
ing the applause of audiences in dif
ferent parts of the country."
"During our tours in Europe," Sousa
says, "we discovered a number of offi
cial and business customs that seemed
strange after long acquaintance with
American methods. Fqr instance. In
Paris the Government takes 10 per cent
of the gross receipts of all amusements
for the support of the charities. In
Russia the same tax is exacted, but it
is collected from the public instead of
tfie attraction, by the addition of a
small amount to the price of each
ticket. In Paris a reserved seat pur
chased before the entertainment costs
rrfore than the regular box office price,
while In Germany it costs less. It is
all in the point of view.
"In several places where more than
one language is current-we had to make
our advertising announcements In poly
glot form. As, for instance, in Warsaw
the posters had to be printed in Rus
sian and Polish, while in Prague both
the Bohemian and German languages
were employed.
"The laws of Russia require all pro
grammes to be submitted to the official
censor for his approval, and while I
was playing in Berlin a telegram came
from the advance agent, who was in
St. Petersburg, making the final ar
rangements, stating that it would be
necessary to file the words of the songs
that our Â¦.soprano was to sing with this
official. The song words were dispatch
ed on the next train, but before they
arrived the agent received another de
mand for them. He rose to the occa
sion and wrote out the verses of the
only songs he could remember. They
happened to be 'Annie Rooney' and
'Marguerite,' while our soprano. Miss
Liebling, really sang the^ mad scene
from 'Lucia' and similar 'numbers at
the concerts. However, no one seemed
to b'e the wiser or the least distressed."
The old question of the Joint en
gagement of husbands and wives is
again being discussed in theatrical cir
cles, owing probably to the fact that a
good many managers in ( their selections
for next season are showing a dispo
sition to draw the line more strictly
than ever before. A young leading man,
whose wife is a talented actress, un
bosomed himself on this subject the
other day to the New York Dramatic
Mirror.
"I believe that ninety per cent of the
matrimonial shipwrecks in the profes
sion are due to separate engagements,"
said he. "At best, the migratory char
acter *of professional life is opposed to
domesticity, but scarcely any life in
common is open to the professional
man and wife unless they are able to
fill joint engagements, and I believe
firmly that that is why we have so
many unfortunate experiences.
"The objections of managers to en
gaging husbands arid wives are mostly
based on unfounded prejudice. Married
couples, as a rule, are willing to make
material sacrifices in respect to salary
In order to be together in the same
company; they are better contented and
usually find a greater interest in their
work and consequently do better work:
they prize the opportunity to preserve
a semblance, at any rate, of the mar
ried existence of other classes of peo
ple, and experience has proved that
their managers find them more re
liable.
"It is a curious thing 1 â _ a demoral
izing one, too â that many of the man
agers who disapprove strenuously of
husbands and wives are not at all par
ticular as to the relations of unmarried
men and women In their companies. I
have noticed this often, and I believe
it Is a source of untold Injury to mem-
as Alan-a-Dale," I said, speaking with
the voice of one who has observed, "the
Tivoli will resound with greeting most
cordial. Then the congregation will sit
back and closely attend to your per
formance. If they are pleased by it,
you will be notified by a demonstration
that will surely 'warm the cockles of
your heart,' as they say in the land of
your forbears. But if, on the other
hand, you fall to come up to the expec
tation created by the advertisements â â.
for my fellow townsmen have not yet
completely lost faith In the_ veracity of
the advance announcements â you will
quickly wish you had canceled before
you signed. No, there will be no hisses,
but a silence so clammy that you would
welcome a hiss or two to break it.
After the first night, however, the si
lence will not be so oppressive, because
there wi!l be fewer people to make it."
"I think your meaning is grasped, f/
saidVMifs Condon. v "The newspapers
and the billboards send a congregation
of fair-minded first-nighters and then
it's me to do the restâ warm them up or
freeze them out."
"You have grasped it," I said.
"After giving me an encouraging re
ception, to show there's no Ill-feeling
to begin with, the people, will settle
back In their seats, the men with arms
folded and the women with hands
crossed In laps. Then they will fix
their optics upon yours truly and say
to themselves: 'Now we've done our
duty; we hope she'll make good.' If
their hope is realized "
"You wouldn't swap Eddy street for

"No, I won't. I'll just say to myself:
'Katherine, your jump to the center
may have been premature, after all.
You pleased New York and Chicago,
my dear, but they don't monopolize the
music culture of this big nation. You
must remember, Kalherlne, that San
Francisco has heard all the big singers
that New York and Chicago has had
and that the people of San Francisco
are qualified by experience to identify
good singing when they hear It.' Then
I would say "
"Then you could say, without prevari
cating, that San Francisco didn't care
who you were, where you came from
or what your preceding fame amounted
to, but treated you strictly in accord
ance with your artistic merits as

already said you would say?"
"Certainly. Why not?"

young female with rounded cheeks.

Strine had told me, until she dropped
that remark anent looking before leap
ing. Something of my thought must
have been conveyed to her, for she
said, smiling:
"I suppose one can be Irish without
being rash?"
â¢â¢Alluding." I ventured, "to your
transit from schoolroom to stage.
"Yes. My parents were born and
bred in Ireland, where our genealogical
tree is rooted somewhere in the twelfth
century, yet more cautious people
never lived. So there is nothing phe
nomenal about my prudence. It has
been with me as long as I can remem
ber â ever since I was a wee girl with
a big voice. In my school days well
meaning but indiscreet adults urged
me to strike right out for a stage
career, but something within me said
that would be a foolish thing to do.
'With your vocal and physical qualifi
cations,' said my advisers, 'it is simply
a matter of seeing a manager, being
engaged on the spot for leading roles,
reveling In calcium baths by night and
receiving press interviewers by day,
donating your surplus floral gifts to
hospitals and wondering how you can
spend all your money.' Alluring vision,
wasn't it? But it never tempted me.
"Better take time to investigate,' said
the inner voice. I obeyed It. Inves
tigation convinced me there was only
one way to reach the center of the
stage with hope of holding it, and that
the route was through years of pa
tient study. It was a hard road to
travel, but I stuck to it untilâ well,
here I am to 6lng first contralto parts
at the Tivoli.
That sentence sufficed to satisfy me
that Mr. Btrine's reputation as a keen
analyst of human character would not
b<* damaged by anything additional
Miss Kate Condon might say.
â¢You will find her," Mr. Strine had
informed me, as we journeyed together
to meet the Tivoli's coming star, "an
exceptional woman of the stage. Cora
snon sense is her distinguishing qual
ity. Her advancement in the profes
sion has been rapid, but she modestly
< stimates her artistic worth. So strong
i* her equipment of sound reason that
1 don't believe she could say or do a
silly thing with serious Intent."
This bit of personal intelligence was
not accepted without making due al
lowance for Mr. Strine's position as
the Tivoli's press representative. It
was his duty, of course, to portray in
unique colors the lady we were en
route to visit, else she might fail of
the interest reputed distinctiveness al
ways invites. On that account, there
fire, it was rather surprising as well
as gratifying to have every tint of his
v.erd picture verified by the subject
herself.
"I did not attempt to Jump from the
i <>nvent door to the center of the
stage."
"And even then," she said, laughing,
"chronic prudence restrained me from
interviewing a manager. 'Just wait.'
whispered Prudence, 'and when you are
fit to appear in opera the proposal will
come to you.' Prudence was rlcht. as
usual. Henry W. Savage, the impre
sario, heard me sing in the choir and
the next day he sent for me. My first
role was that of Siebel in 'Faust,' and
Mr. Savage immediately booked me for
three years with his New York Castle
Square Company."
She sang various roles with the Castle
Square organization, and with the con
clusion of her engagement came offers
galore. While they were under consid
eration Mr. Savage made his memor
able â and costly â move to the Metro
politan Opera-house by arrangement
with Maurice Grau, and Miss Condon
was chosen from many applicants to
sing Siebel, her first role, in the open
ing performance of "Faust."
"At that time," she continued, "im
presarii were beginning to corral
grand opera singers into the lighter
works of musical comedy and comic
opera and they offered better salaries
than the grand opera managers could
or would pay. For a while I resisted
all overtures to abandon the grand
opera field, because I had not advanced
as far in it as I desired, but finally I
yielded tc the terms proposed by
Messrs. Fisher & Riley, whose 'Floro
dora' was then in Its first ecstacy of
success at the New York Casino., I
took the role of Dolores in the produc
tion and so satisfying were the results
that I bade adieu to the 'heavies' and
decided to remain In light opera."
Her next important engagement was
with Jefferson de Angelis in Sir Arthur
Sullivan's final opera, "The Emerald
Isle," and all the New York critics
said that to her work as the coquettish
Molly was due mostly the success of
the production.
"Then I joined the Bostonians," she
said, "and sang the leading contralto
roles of their repertoire. It Is no envi
able ordoal, I tell you. to step Into a
part that has already been 'created' by
a popular favorite. Comparisons are
inevitable, and usually unfair', for no
matter how successful is the artist who
succeeds the 'creator,' the first impres
sions of the public are as lasting as
they are prejudiced. Understanding
this, you may realize how much I value
these criticisms of my first appearance
as Alan-a-Dale In 'Robin Hood' at the
New York Academy of Music last Aug
ust."
The notices certainly were worthy of
their foremost place in the Condon
Ecrap-bcok. All of them pronounced
the new Alan-a-Dale equal <ln every
detail of attractiveness to tnS"""crea
tion" of Jessie Bartlett-Davis, and
some of them" said. that Kate Condon
was the only legitimate successor, vo
cally, dramatically and physically, of
the origmal leading contralto of the
Bostonians.
"That was my most gratifying tri
umph," said Miss Condon, "because it
was the first actual comparative test
of my ability. My preceding roles had
either been 'created' by me or sang by
many artists before I; assumed them,
and it certainly was pleasant to be re
leased from the trepidation accompa
nying my debut in the part where Jes
sie Bartlett-Davis made her greatest
success. When the Bostonians pro
duced 'The Serenade' in Chicago I sang
Dolore^'and the critics again gave me
primal Donors â but the fact that I was
a Chlcag6~g1rl may have had something
to do with that."
Which reminded her to ask the ques
tion that all newcomers of her profes
sion ask concerning San Francisco
audience?. Contradictory reports - of
their treatment of strange stage artists
had reached het In the East. She would
like to get the truth of It.
".When you make your first entrance
bers of the profession and a menace to
the morale of the stage."
Probably not more than one person
in ten thousand takes the trouble to
verify the extravagant assertions of
theatrical managers with regard to the
long runs enjoyed by certain plays. A
writer on a New York paper has gone
into the detective business on his own
hook and has discovered some very
amusing as well as startling discrepan
cies between the advertised number of
performances and the actual presenta
tions of some of the plays heralded as
having enjoyed long runs. He tells of
one attraction on Broadway which kept
the other managers figuring when it
opened and when" it would close. This
show opened on October 31 ai\d on De
cember 1 it was advertised that it was
"now In its third rnonth^' The piece
had been playing at the theater for ex
actly thirty-two days, or a trifle over
one month, yet the managers could
scarcely be called jugglers of truth for
saying it was, in its third month,
inasmuch as it had been played in Oc
tober. November and December. An
other attraction which opened on De
cember 24 was advertised on January 2
as being in Its second month, which
was really true. But the boldest at
tempt to deceive the public was the an
nouncement on January 2 of an attrac
tion that opened on December 24. to
the effect that it was "in its second
year In New York.'" The press agenta
of some of the plays which are reputed
to have long runs In the metropolis
must burn the midnight oil in their ef
forts to conjure up something that will
sound mighty big, but which is really
very small when investigated.

Special Dispatch to Th* Call
Lieutenant Smith at once requested
that his father. Colonel Allen Smith,
Sixth Cavalry, be sent for. Colonel
Smith, who is stationed at Fort Meade,
Nebraska, immediately responded to
his son's request and arrived in town
yesterday. He at once called epon Gen
eral MacArtbur.
Lieutenant Smith graduated from
West Point in 1503. He comes of a
family of army people. His father and
his grandfather are army men, and his
brother. Lieutenant Alien Smith Jr., is
in the Third Infantry.
Lieutenant White is not a West Point
man, but received his commission
through the influence of his father.
Colonel Markley is greatly upeet over
the different incidents that have hap
pened during his command here of the
Thirteenth Infantry. The scandal of
the Roblchon cast was much deplored
by him. This was quickly followed by
the earlier escapades of Lieutenants
White and Smith., and later by their
outbreak of indecency that will doubt
less terminate their careers as officers
of Uncle Sam's army. Close on the
heels of this affair, which was kept
quiet for eome days, came the shock
ing suicide of one of Colonel Mark
ley's most respected captains, Freder
ick S. Wild. The colonel's bed is not
Â«ae of roses. Â¦ â¢ â¢ â¢
Boon after this Lieutenants Smith
and White called upon Colonel Mark
ley and tried to offer an explanation
for their extraordinary conduct. The
colonel refused to permit any discus
sion of the matter, as their actions had
been too flagrant. This ended the af
fair so far as Colonel Markley was con
cerned. ' >,'â¢ .
Next morning all kinds of report*
were handed to Colonel Markley.' He
Immediately summoned the two officers
before him and requested them for
their own self-preservation to hand in
their resignations.- This they took un
der consultation. In the meantime the
two women who had taken part in the
orgy wandered down to the dock in
the most nonchalant manner and took
the eteamer McDowell back to San
Francisco.
TRIED TO EXPLAIN'.
White passed them through the lines
and they at once proceeded to his
quarters. About this time Lieutenant
Smith Joined in the festivities. Un
fortunately for Lieutenant White, his
house was in a long row, in prox
imity to those of the ether officers.
The early part of the evening's enter
tainment passed off quietly enough, but
as the night wore on and the Joyous
nees of the sparkling wines they Imbibed
was communicated to the merry-mak
ers laughter became unrestrained and
the peace of the little fort was for the
nonce turned into a mild pandemonium.
The orgy Is reported to have lasted
until the "wee small hours."
Beinj young men of convivial spirit
they soon formed a close friendship.
Joint visits to the city generally ended
in sprees. Both got a reputation as
hard drinkers. It is reported that
erasetJmes the sprees iaete3< toaxezjtt,
five days. Reveilles "were not answered
and, In fact, the commanding officer
fc- I often to reprimand them for this
Offense. The climax came, however,
when they introduced the women into
their quarters.
As is -well known, no person is al
lowed to land upon Angel Island with
out a written order from the command
ant of the island or an order from the
general commanding the department.
The two women in question hired a
launch and boldly sailed up to the Mc-
Dowell dock, where they were received
by Lieutenant "White, who, at that
time, was ofHcer of the day.
Lieutenants "White and Smith im
mediately handed in their resignations.
It now rests with General MacArthur
whether he will indorse them and hand
them to the President or will demand
a trial by court-martial here.
Lieutenants Smith and White were
ordered out to Angel Island about four
months ago. Smith went to the dis
charge camp and White to the post at
Fort McDowelL
The climax in recent army sensa
tions is presented by the forced resig
nations, now in General MacArthur*s
hands, of Lieutenants Charles W.
Smith and \Y. W. White, stationed at
Fort McDowell, Angrcl Is-land. The
resignations followed a long: course
of riotous dissipation^, ending in a
grievous insult to the post-
Colonel Markler, commander c-f the
Thirteenth Infantry, at Angel Island,
is a very forbearing man, but he had
to draw the Hne when Lieutenants
Smith and White one night last week
brought women Into the camp and in
dulged in s.n orgy that stirred the
quiet post of Fort McDowell into a
frenzy of excitement and indignation.
The serial cÂ«.-!or.cl could overlook a
treat deal in a young officer who came
over to town and quaffed the flowing
bowl to the limn, but returned to an
swer roll call. Perhaps he could, and
did, condone the lack of strict attention
to even this regulation form of early
morning duty.
The colonel, however, put his foot
down squarely at the final insult to
the pott and to the army and told the
offenders that there was only one
course for them to pursue. That was
their resignations cr their trials before
a court-martial.

DENVER, June 11.â The executive
board of the Western Federation of
Miners to-day Issued a statement re
garding the situation in Cripple Creek
in reply to the statements . made by
General Sherman M.. Bell and Secre
tary C. C. Hamlin of the Cripple Creek
District Mine Owners' Association. It
is in part as follows:
. "The cause of the strike of the West
ern Federation of Miners in Colorado
is one of longstanding and involves the
failure on the part of mine managers
in various parts of the State to live up
to their own written agreements. As
far back as 18S4, as a result of the
strike at that time, the mine owners
agreed that eight hours should consti
tute a day's work, that the minimum
daily wage should be $3 and that there
should be no discrimination against un
ion men in the hiring and discharge of
labor. At the outset of the present
trouble Manager McNelll of the Stand
ard mill, at Colorado City, peremptor
ily discharged forty-five men, members
of the Western Federation of Miners,
for no other reason, than that they had
become union men. All of these were
old employeSvOf from two to six years'
standing. Mlllmen are affiliated with
the Western Federation of Miners and
are entitled to all of the protection that
goes with such membership.
QUESTIONS AT ISSUE.
"To-day the only questions involved
are the enforcement of the eight-hour
day and the right of men to organize
into unions and to prevent discrimina
tion against union men of all kinds.,
"The responsibility for the lawless
ness connected with the contest rests
entirely on the shoulders of the mine
operators, the Citizens' Alliance and
their allies, backed, up by the ready
power of -the State government. The
responsibility has been placed on these
persons v and organizations by District
Judge Theron Stevens, who denounced
the military usurpation In Telluride in
strong language from 'the bench; by
District Judge J. Walter Dlckson, Re
publican, who openly condemns Gov
ernor Peabody and severely criticizes
his acts involving the deportation of
men "from the State without trial or
other chance of hearing; by ex-G6v
ernor Charles 8. Thomas, who plainly
points to the Mine Owners' Association
and the Citizens' Alliance as being re
sponsible for the many outrages com
mitted on the persons of helpless and
Innocent miners: by the recent Demo
cratic State Convention, which de
nounced in scathing terms the line of
policy pursued. < ... i . : .
LIST OF GRIEVANCES.
NO FEDERAL INTERFERENCE,
. "The events of the present week in

accusation contained above. The fol
lowing-crimes > Upon citizenship have
followed swiftly '.upon one another:

NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR CRIME.
"Absolutely no death has ever oc
curred during the contest for which
the Western Federation of, Miners can
or ought to be held responsible.
"We are unfortunately forced to
abide by the acts of an unbridled mili
tary despotism that is driving our
members from pillar to post. Their
fortitude under the circumstances is
the marvel of th^/age and shows the
Western Federation of Miners is com
posed of the highest type of American
citizenship.
"Our attitude Is fully expressed by
the following telegram:
i"'Hon. Theodore Roosevelt, Presi
dent of the United States, Wash
ington, ~ D. C.: A duty devolves
upon you as President of the
United States to investigate the
terrible crimes that are being perpe
trated in Colorado in the name of law
and order. We will render every pos
sible assistance to the proper authori
ties in such investigation, to the end
that the people of the country may
realize the outrages that are being in
flicted on innocent persons by those
In temporary official- power.
" *W. D. Haywood, Secretary.' "
The exiles were a cheerless lot,,in
deed. Without even a light and miles
from the nearest habitation, they hud
dled together in groups on either side
of' the Santa Fe track and. discussed
their plight. Warned to move * east
ward',' on pain of being rearrested and
severely handled, and notified by the
Kansas authorities that '.they would
not be allowed 'ta seek refuge In that
State, the spirit of the men , broke.
Many of them walked back westward
on 'the railroad to Holly, the Salva
tion Army colony In Colorado, where
the charitable inhabitants provided
breakfast for them. Some of them
lat^r started to walk to Lamar, Colo.
Sheriff Jack Brady and forty depu
ties of Hamilton County were at the
State line to prevent the deported men
entering Kansas.
And no time was wasted. The spe
cial, which consisted of an, engine, a
combination baggage car and smoker
and two day coaches, had no sooner
come to a standstill than the car
doors were unlocked and thrown open
and the order given by Lieutenant
Cole for the exiles to leave the train.
"Step lively, you felltiws, step live
ly," admonished Deputy Benton, who
was in command of the civil forces
of the expedition, and in less time
than it takes to tell it the three cars
were emptied of their passengers and
the train was started on Its way back
to La Junta.
The men were dumped out on the
cheerless prairie without food or wa
ter, for the soldiers and deputies, in
their haste to get home,, had forgotten
to unload the small stock of commis
sary supplies the train carried when it
left Victor yesterday afternoon. "
. SPIRIT OF MEN" BREAKS..
WITHOUT POOD OR WATER.
. "Hurry up there, you fellows,"crled
Lieutenant Cole, when the train stop
ped in the midst of the alkali sand
dunes that dot the prairie In the vi
cinity of the eastern part of Powers
County near the Kansas line. "We
haven't got any time to waste out
here."
HOLLY, Colo., 'June 11. â "With a
parting volley of rifle bullets, flred
over their heads by the militia and
deputies to, warn them to "hike" east
ward as fast as their legs could carry
them and never again set foot on Col
orado soil, ninety-one union miners
from the Cripple Creek district were
unloaded from a special Santa Fe
train on the prairie this morning, one
half mile from the Colorado-Kansas
State line, and left to shift for them
selves. The exiles were disembarked
in haste and without ceremony. The
guards and deputies were tired out
and in ill humor from their long, te
dious trip from the Teller County gold
camp and were in n,o mood to extend
any special courtesies or kindness to
their unfortunate charges.
SYRACUSE, Kansas, June 11.â The
deported Colorado miners Â¦ camped at
Holly to-night. Just across the Color

that a special train would be sent to
take them all to Denver.

Additions to the Japanese Army Be
sleging Port Arthur.
LLA OYANG, June 11.â Reports ' from
Chinese sources are to the' effect that
the Japanese forces near Port Arthur
have been heavily reinforced. It is be
lieved that an attempt to take the for
tress by assault will be made as soon
as the Japanese are strong enough to
invest' It on the land side and at the
same, time protect themselves from pos-
Elble attack In the i^ar in case the Rus
sians snnt a force from the north.
There are persistent reports again
that the Port Arthur squadron has suc
ceeded In making a sortie, but no offi
cial confirmation of the report is ob
tainable.
The Russian reinforcements .on their
way hore will soon materially change
the situation and enable General Kuro
patkin to move freely.
General Kuroki's main army is still
at Fengwanjrcheng. Russian outposts
cover his right flank above Saimatsze
and extending eastward. They " are
constant |S| in touch with the enemy,
and theroare almost daily skirmishes
of more or' less importance.

wegion tramp steamship, as reported,
or quietly practicing In some secluded
Long Island cove preparatory for a
test. 0
But It makes little difference from an
International point of view what has
become of this boat, In the opinion of
the State Department! since Hamilton
Pish, when Secretary of- State, laid
down an opinion to the - effect that a
torpedo boat capable, of being carried
on the deck of a ship might properly
be regarded as ah article of mer
chandise and so might be sold to a
belligerent without violation of . neu
trality, but subject to the risk of seiz

wine sparingly, smokes a cigar or two
after breakfast and sets a general ex
ample of abstemiousness to his officers.
He rises at 7 o'clock and retires at
midnight.
' General Kuropatkin is much inter
ested in the Red Cross work, visits the
hospitals and speaks encouragingly to
the patients. He never misses going to
the station at the time of the train's
bringing wounded men, and out of the
funds sent from St. Petersburg gives
them money according to their rank,
$1 50 to an unmarried man, *52 50 to a
married man and as much as 5250 to

cided to carry out. without change the
naval programme provisionally adopt
ed before the war. ! The programme
covers a decade. The ships' will be
divided between the' Blacx Sea and the
Baltic fleets, and no provision is made
for the Pacific fleet. The construction
of the new vessels will begin at once.
The ships will be built in Russia,
though France may poBslbly get a con
tract. The proportion of battleships
and cruisers will be practically the
same as proposefl by the general board
at "Washington for the United States
navy.
The Japanese brought up a mountain
battery and enfiladed the Russian
flank and a sharp artillery duel ensued.
The Japanese battery, however, was
quickly silenced and followed out of
range by the Russian artillery.
The Japanese infantry finally turned
the position held by the Cossacks on the
hill east of Siuyen and forced the Rus
sians to retire. The movement was ex
ecuted in an orderly manner and, cov
ered by their artillery, the Russians re
tired to Modyanka and thence through
the hills to the Haicheng road.
A conference was had at the Tsarkoe-
Sele to-day between the Emperor,
Grand Duke Alexis, the Russian high
admiral, and Vice Admiral Avelin, chief
ThÂ« Japanese first appeared upon the
read between Uhaasa and Siuyen and
advanced on the Russian position in
close formation. They were met with
an excellently directed artillery fire
and forced to retire with heavy losses.
Meanwhile the Japanese infantry ad
vanced upon the hill occupied by the
Cossacks, to whose assistance three
companies were successively called up.
After a gallant fight of two hours the
Cossacks retired, but it' was a barren
victory for the Japanese. The Russian
artillery was turned on the hill vacated
by the Cossacks and the Japanese
found the position untenable and were
forced to flee.
ST. PETERSBURG. June 1LâDe
scribing the fl^ht at Siuyen, a corre
spondent says the Russian forces were
south of the town, guarding the Siu
yen-Takushan roal. The artillery was
strongly posted on the hills along the
road from Siuyen to Tyandpoodsa, with
a mixed company guarding the flank
and another company posted on Loo
duopfy Hill. The Russian transport
train was at the village of Kouloosi,
guarded by Cossacks.
L.IAOYANTG, June 11^-The entire
Russian plan of campalgm is directed
from a railway carriage here, In which
General Kuropatkin works, eats and
sleeps. The car is divided into a sa
loon, a Â§tudy and a bedroom. The
commander-In-chief passes the most of
his time in the study at : work, . sur
rounded by his aids.
Although small of stature, Kuropat
kin is at once distinguished among his
entourage, however brilliant may be
their uniforms, by his " brilliant ges
tures and sturdy figure. He has .the
reputation of being Just, and his word
is law f . His officers express the fullest
confidence In him and he is the idol of
the common soldiers, and the foreign
attaches find him most pleasant. He
takes little or no rest, except' a half
hour's siesta after luncheon, when the
heat is excessive, and^he occasionally
indulges in the distraction of reading
literary works. Dispatches .from the
scene of operations are brought to him
at any hour of the day or night.

luckily the wind' shifted, and all dan

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., June 11.â Word
has been received from Mrs. Phoebe
Hearst, who has been supplying the
funds, that the Harvard Egyptolobical
exploring expedition at Girga, under
Professor George Reisner, must be
given up, as she Is inot able to
finance the work for the present. This
decision comes as an unexpected blow
to the .Harvard authorities, who had
been led to believe that for the next
five years at least the researches might
be carried on, as the outlook at Girga
is so promising. Many American
savants have believed that within the
next half decade Professor Reisner
would rival arty European discoverer
In that field. He has an annual endow
ment from Mrs. Hearst of $12,000, ten
tatively for five years, and Harvard is.
not In a position at present to make
up that sum.
An explanation of Mrs. Hearst's sud
den withdrawal of support is given,
and is to the effect that a large mine In
which she is Interested must make a
change in the processes of treating
ores, the expense of the change being
so costly as to preclude dividends for
some time.

on a charge of having stolen goods In

cuse them of secreting In their home
at Corte Madera jewels stolen In May,
1902. from Dr. H. C. MInton, formerly
of the San Anselmo Theological Sem

of the case rests with the proper au
thorities, who will without doubt take
Into consideration all the facts and
circumstances.
McKinley's death was due to
Rright's disease, ' which developed
shortly after the death of his dis
tinguished brother, three years ago.
Since then McKinley has devoted near
ly all his time in a vain attempt to
overcome the fatal malady, consulting
the most eminent physicians and
traveling from one climate to another.
Two weeks ago he returned from
Tampa, Fla., where he had been for
six weeks. The sufferer was not con
fined to bed and yesterday evening
took a drive into the country, accom
panied by his wife.
CANTON*. Ohio, June 11. â The body
of Abner McKinley will be brought to
Canton for burial beside his mother

The funeral services, It Is expected,
will be held on Monday afternoon. ,A
wife and one daughter, - Mrs. Mabel
McKinley Baer, survive.
SOMERSET. Pa., June 11. â Abner
McKInley, brother of the late Presi
dent, was found dead in a chair at his
home at 8 o'clock this morning. His
death came without warning to his
family. His colored servant, who slept
in his room, was up with him at 2
o'clock and It Is not known at what
time McKinley got up again, as he did
not waken his servant. Mrs. McKln
ley walked into his room at 8 o'clock
and found him sitting in a chair cold
and apparently dead. A physician
was summoned, who said death had
probably occured two or three hours
before.
The required reserve was increased
$2,60S,075, deducting which from the
gain in' cash left $3,801,525 as tlie in
crease in surplus reserve to $35,562,400,
the highest of the year. The previous
maximum surplus was $34,203,700 on
April 23. Computed on the basis of de
posits, less those of $23,363,800 of Gov
ernment funds, the surplus is $41,403,350.
Circulation was increased $S06,000,
making the gain in this item during
the past three weeks $1,607,600. The
statement was made on rising averages
for cash, the $2,697,000 paid by the sub
treasury by the transfer of the pro
ceeds of Japanese gold deposited at
San Francisco counting for only about
$1,000,000 in the averages. The public
deposits were decreased only $1700, com
pared with those of the previous week.
NEW TORK, June 11.â The Financier
says: The striking features of the of
ficial statement of the New York Asso
ciated Banks last week were the high
records for the year for surplus re
serve and for cash and legal tender;
the surplus holdings were only $4,155,000
below the May movement. As was ex
pected, loans were expanded, probably
as the result of new engagements by
commission houses and also of some
syndicate borrowing; the amount of
such expansion was, however, moder
ate, it being only^ $3,528,100. Speciein
creased $5,019,100, while legal tenders
increased $1,390,500. The gain In cash
was therefore $6,409,600, an amount very
closely corresponding to that of $3,561,-
S00, which was estimated on the basis
of the traceable movements of money
for the week. Deposits were increased
$10,432,300, which amount was $3,505,400
below the sum of the Increase in loans
and the gain in cash, therefore the
statement did not balance.

HOUSTON. Texas, June) 11.â Mlsa
Kate Sendrey, a beautiful girl of 20.
shortly after midnight this morning
shot and killed her brother-in-law, J.
Nelson Prowse, at his home at Austin.
Miss Sendrey was on a visit to her
sister at the house and the deed was
done In self protection. Prowse, who
was foreman of the Austin Statesman,
returned home shortly before midnight
in a state of intoxication. Mrs. Prowse
through fear fled and this angered him
to the extent that he threatened to
murder Miss Sendrey and his own
daughter, a little girl of four. Miss
Sendrey managed to get a revolver that
was kept at the house and armed her
self with it. Prowse's violence In
creased until he made an assault upon
her, when she drew the weapon from
her corsage and fired.
The bullet passed through the body
near the navel and caused almost im
mediate death. This morning Miss
Sendrey underwent the formalities of
arrest, but was quickly released upon
a $500 bond.
Miss Sendrey has spent several sea
sons in Arizona with relatives, and
there learned the use of firearms. Ow
ing to the young lady's attractiveness
and poplarity the tragedy has produced
a profound sensation.

SALEM. Mass., June 11.â Mrs. Jennie
Sanborn. a Pan Francisco woman, who
is in Salem for the summer, charges
Christopher Chisholm of this city of
having robbed her of $1000 and some
jewelry while Chisholm was acting as
her guide about the city. According to
the San Franciscan, a year has seen
her faith In men rudely snattered, for
it was less than a year ago that she
married George Sanborn or San Fran
cisco and as soon as Sanborn had se
cured $2000 of her money, she alleges,
he deserted her.
Chisholm spun a despondent and
hard luck tale so nicely, alleges the
woman, that "she pityingly bought him
a new suit. He managed on some pre
text to call at her room and after he
had gone she missed the money and a
gold watch. Chisholm had the watch
on him when arrested.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call
It is said that the department since
receiving the letter of explanation from
Colonel Pitcher may, upon suggestions
that have been made heretofore, leave
the entire matter to the civil courts,
deeming it a much too delicate affair to
be gone into by a court-martial. Much
sympathy is expressed for the lady in"
the case, who is a clerk in the "War
Department, on account of the pub
licity attained. It was first brought to
public notice through the appeal in her
behalf made by Hon. John Humphrey
Small, a member of Congress from
North Carolina, who Is a relative of
Miss Harold, and who enlisted the
sympathy of Secretary Taft.
Captain Parker declines . to make
public Colonel Pitcher's defense. He
talked freely of Colonel Pitcher's serv
ices, his character, his standing as a
soldier and a gentleman, and recounted
his services in cleaning up the city of
Havana as provost marshal, and his
later services in the Philippines, where
he (Parker) served with him In Luzon;
of his having pacified a territory great
er in size than the whole Pacific slope,
and in such manner that never has a
complaint or criticism appeared to
embarrass him or the administration.
He also spoke of Colonel Pitcher's still
more recent services in Alaska, whence
he was sent directly from the Philip
pines.
When the subject of the "Pitcher
case" was broached all Captain Parker
would say was: "If I were not satis
fied that Colonel Pitcher is free from
any serious blame I would not be in
the case at all. The code of a gentle
man Is to take his medicine and keep
his mouth shut, where a woman is con
cerned. That is what Colonel Pitcher
is doing and I honor him for it. It is
a case which should, never have been
made public, in my opinion. Motives
of sound public policy should exclude
from public discussion certain sacred
domestic affairs, especially when these
affairs Involve deeper tragedies of the
heart and home. This is a case in
which publicity should never have been
invoked in the first place. The decision

in the city of Captain John H. Parker,
Twenty-eighth Iqfantry, from the Pre
sidio, with authority to present the
case of Lieutenant Colonel William L.
Pitcher touching the charge laid against
him of having jilted Miss Carolina Har
old, has put a somewhat different face
upon the incident. "Whatever may be
done in the matter by the "War Depart
ment, if anything, It is time to say
that the story sent out to the effect
that a court-martial has been decided
upon was premature. Secretary Taft
has taken no action in the matter fur
ther than to cause an Inquiry to be
started. Lieutenant Colonel Pitcher
has been given permission to make his
statement, and following a recital of
the circumstances attending the break
ing of the engagement made by letter
comes Captain Parker, who will be
given an opportunity to be heard on
Monday.

BQRAXOLOGY
Boraxology is the science of health, and
health is largely a matter of cleanliness.
It may startle die unboraxed p*rt of the
community to hear it, but as a matter of
fact people who don f t use BORAX aren't
really clean, simply because you can't
wash anything clean in hard city water, no
matter how much soap or elbow grease
you use. BORAX softens the water and
gives it cleansing power* When you
wash anything add a little Borax to the
water* YouTl get twice the result with
half the effort* Great care should be
taken to get pure Borax, as imitations are
worthless and often injurious* Ask for

LOS ANGELES, June 11.â The prin
ciple in law that insanity Is not a
sound or natural ground for divorce
was clearly exemplified by Superior
Judge M. T. Allen In refusing to 'grant
a decree to Mattie A. Kentring. In
denying the divorce Judge Allen said
in part:
"Insanity on the part of either hus
band or wife is no ground for divorce.
Persons who are under the marital
obligations, if one or the other lose
his or her mind, are In Justness bound
each to the other more closely.
"There Is no condition in life un
der which the unfortunate partner
should receive greater attention or
more loving care and kindness than
under the burden of a distorted mind.
The decree is denied." ~

Time Will "~ Devoted to Preparing
for the Production of "Robin
Hood."
A i>ortentous event is in the way of
preparation at the Tlvoli Opera-house.
"Robin Hood," the most successful
light opera ever penned by American
composers, which has been performed
i for thirteen years exclusively by the
famous Bostonians and which has been
secured by the Tlvoli management by
a special arrangement with that or
ganization, will be put on for a run
just as soon as a brief season of ardu
ous rehearsal is brought to a close.
The opera-house will close for a week
after the final performance of "Ser
geant Kitty" to-night.
All the forces at the Tivoli's com
mand will be bent toward giving a per
formance of "Robin Hood" that shall
go on record as "superb." The scenery
and costumes will be all that the strict
est demands of the book and the locale
require, while the musical and stage
forces win be put to the test of/ the
severest comparisons to insure a per
fect rendition.
The cast that will Interpret "Robin
Hood" will challenge comparison with
any singing cast anywhere. Several of
the names have been especially Ident
ified with the opera and the others will
command attention. Announcement of

FLORENCE. Arit, June 1L â John
Manning, n Deer Creek rancher and the
principal witness for the Territory In
the prosecution of W. T. Armstrong,
former Sheriff of Gila County and head
cf * rang of c&ttle thieves, has dropped
out of sight.
Manning's disappearance is unac
countable except for the Tact that he
took euch a prominent part in the pros
ecution of Armstrog. who was srnt to
the penitentiary. It Is no secret that
members of the Armstrong gang tried
to intimidate Manning before the trlaJ
and threatened vengeance after the
cattle thief was sent over the road for
five years.
Manning was as handy with a six-
Bhooter as any member of the gang and
told them openly that they would never
pet him except from ambush.
Strange to say the Deer Creek
rancher disappeared during a visit to
Florence, Thursday, and his horse was
found Friday morning: where he had
put it out. Both his rifle and slxshooter
were strapped to the saddle. Two or
three notorious members of the Arm
strong gang, who are out on bonds,
have been hanging around Florence,
and the officers fear that Manning has
met with foul rlay.
Ho never returned to his Deer Creek
ranch after leaving It on Wednesday.
Bzxdal Dispatch to Th* OOL
There has been some Improvement
in the investment demand for well
secured railroad mortgages, but fluctu
ations in more speculative bonds have
kept the price movement irregular.
United States new fours declined %
and the twos have advanced U per
cent on call during the week.
' European money centers have
grown quite plethoric. There have
been further large receipts of Japan
ese gold at San Francisco, somewhat
contrary to expectations, as the flota
tion of the Japanese loan was ex
pected to check this movement of
gold. The course of the Government
revenues at Washington arouses some
doubts whether the Treasury Depart
ment will be in a position to take
measures for the relief of the money
market which have been employed at
that season for a number of years. A
strong banking position to meet the
fall requirements is therefore regarded
as essential.
Railroad earnings made a continu
ous exhibit of decreases from last
year's level, and the decreased volume
of bank clearings is evidence to the
same effect. While money has con
tinued easy and in little demand the
cessation of the gold export move
ment has been of good effect on senti
ment.
The growth ofi a hopeful feeling
regarding the grain crops has fur
nished a great assurance over the busi
ness prospect In general. Reports of
railroad traffic officials and merchants
disclose the opinion that the level of
business, although admittedly lower
than last year, may be regarded as a
firm basis, with many hopes of expan
sion after the political campaign, sup
posing the harvesting of good crops.
Some such confidence must be ac
cepted for explanation of the firm
neES of the market in face of the evi
dent contraction of business in the
East. The estimate of the output in
iron was the week's most satisfactory
record. â
RAILROAD EARNINGS.
The Financial Chronicle estimates
that the municipal bond sale for
May reached $54,404,338. This in
cludes the $37,000,000 by city bond
issue, but the aggregate figures reached
to one-th'rd the total sales of mu
nicipal bonds for the full calendar
year of 1903. The same authority as
serts that the active demand for mu
nicipal Issues is prompting the con
tinuing flotation of unusually large
amounts of bonds. Total sales of
bonds to-day* (par value), $1,510,000.
Prices of stocks have been strength
ened this week and there has been an
occasional stirring of something like
speculative interest. The movement
was largely due to professional opera
tions withinMhe exchange and was to
an extent in sympathy with the move
ments In special stocks.
SALE OF BONDS.
NEW YORK. June 11. â The short
session of the Stock Exchange to-day
showed good support for prices and
the market closed firm, at the top
level of the week. There was con
siderable realizing, but it was evident
that sufficient satisfaction was felt
over the color of the monthly crop re
port to prompt a good absorption of
this realizing. The day's gains were
not striking, but the steadiness of
prices, in view of the activity of trad
ing, made the tone good. The bank
statement showed about the expected
gain in cash resources and sufficient
to meet the added reserve require
ments by reason of the riae in de
posits, with a margin of $3,801,625,
which w'ent to enhance the surplus
reserve of the banks. .A report from
Washington asserted that permission
had been given for the deposit of
J2.100.000 atthe New York Sub-Treas
ury for transfer by telegraph to San
Francisco, which is a reversal of the
recent current between the two cen
ters without explanation. The mar
ket for investment securities begins to
reflect unmistakable pressure to find
employment for idle capital. To-day's
bond market was broader and more
active than that for stocks. It is
pointed out also that a large business
is being done In high grade railroad
bonds over the counters of the bond
house which does not figure â¢ in the
Stock Exchange transaction.
There are about 10,000 bootblacks on
Manhattan Island, and it is estimated
that 300.000 men have their shoes pol
ished daily.
NEW YORK, June 11.â Bootblacks
from the Battery to the Harlem are ex
cited over an invasion of their domain
by an electric shoe polishing machine.
The mere suggestion that their artis
tic work can be duplicated by a me
chanical contrivance has aroused an
Indignant protest, and at a meeting of
the United Bootblacks* Protective Un
ion it was decided to fight the auto
matic rate-cutting: device.
From proprietors of polishing' parlors
In office buildings, who have accumu
lated fortunes, down to the bare-footed
urchin whose entire capital is a box and
a pair of brushes, there was but one
opinion to-day â "Da machina is no
gooda."
By offering shines for a nickel, and
in quicker time than It Is possible with
an expert bootblack on each foot, the
machine threatens to eat into the in
comes of the frugal Italians, and they
are determined to prevent Its general
introduction In this city. . That the com
pany behind the machine has the back
ing of Standard Oil Interests and is
capitalized at $250,000 does not frighten
them.

PREPARING TO BUILD
ROAD FRO3I OAKDALE
Company Is 'incorporated and Con
tracts for Grading the Line
Are Awarded.
The company that purposes to build
a road from Oakdale to Rlverbank, a
station on the Santa Fe's valley route,
was incorporated yesterday under the
name of the Oakdale and * Western
Railway Company. The road, under
the present plans, will cover a distance
of six miles, connecting the Santa Fe
system with the Sierra Railway' and
thereby affording the Santa Fe Com
pany privileges over the Oakdale route
into the Yosemite Valley. A contract
for the grading of the roadbed was
awarded yesterday. It provides that
the work shall be completed by Au
gust 15, when the company will be
ready to begin laying its rails.
The project is backed by William
R. Thorsen and his Eastern associates,
who purchased the West Side Lumber
Company about a year ago, and is said
to have resulted from the Southern
Pacific Company's attempt to enforce
a prohibitive tariff on the product of
the big mills bought by the Thorsen
syndicate. The latter purpose event
ually to extend the new road south aa
far as Santa Clara, with a view of sup
plying the fruit growers of that valley
with boxes and handling eastbound
fruit to its connecting point with the
Santa Fe line.
Minnle* Adams Again in Court.
Minnie Adams, who was granted a
new trial by the Supreme Court on the
charge of murdering her infant son,
John Richard Gray, on March 13.
1899, by making him swallow a dose
of carbolic acid, appeared before
Judge Lawlor, yesterday and the case
was continued till June 25 to be set.
She looked â¢ haggard and aged. She
was convicted of murder in the first
degree on July 31, 1899, and on Sep-
Mrs. Clara Carney has removed her
belongings from the apartments at 2827
Sixteenth street, owned by Joseph
Enos, and Judge Mogan has dismissed
the charge of peace disturbance filed
against her by that gentleman several
weeks ago, when he complained that
she was an undesirable tenant because
she had presented his potted plants to
her friends after vainly trying to dis
guise the pots with paint. Mrs. Carney
laid several Impeachments against Mr.
Enos, and as the honors seemed to.be
about ,Â«ven, the Judge wisely con
tinued the case until Mrs. "* Carney's
month's occupancy expired and she
could remove her household goods
without rekindling the rumpus.
Edward Trewin, charged with ap
propriating to his own use certain
funds entrusted to his keeping as col
lector for the Bertin Dye Works, plead
ed guilty to misdemeanor embezzle

NEW YORK, June 1Lâ With 718 per
sons in the steerage, the American liner
Philadelphia reached port to-day. The
Philadelphia Is the first vessel to arrive
from an English port since the new
cut rate of $3 CO for each steerage pas
senger -was established.
This low rate Is ridding the low quar
ter of London of its undesirable popu
lation, and the scum of Whitechapel is
now coming to this country.
The status of those who arrived by
the Philadelphia has not yet been de
termined by the Immigration officials.
The contingent was brought to Ellis
Island Just as the hour of examination
was closing.

Seventeen-year-old Sue Anderson of
223 Ivy avenue would now be a June
bride and receiving congratulations as
Mrs. Frank Benjamin If It had not
been a sort of unofficial half holiday
in the City Hall and Hall of Justice
and the Mogan marriage bureau.
Miss Anderson's relatives had Mr.
Benjamin arrested for assuming the
responsibilities of paternity without
undergoing the ceremonial prelimi
nary insisted upon by common mor
ality and the statutes of the State of
California, and he was booked to an
swer before Judge Mogan yesterday.
Then It was announced that he had
expressed a willingness to rectify the
omission referred to on condition that
he would not be prosecuted. Miss An-
"Fo f twenty yeahs, yo* Honnah," said
Miss Waterford to Police Judge Mogan,
"this yah defendant enjoyed mah es
teem an' respeck. I regahded him as
a pufflck gen'lem'n. Dat's wot an
guished me."
Miss Waterford then went on to state
that on Friday afternoon she was en
tertaining at her resldence,168 Tehama
street, a couple of her friends, and that
during her temporary absence to pur
chase refreshments the domicile was
Invaded by Charles Green, who offered
lottery tickets for 6ale. Miss Water
ford's friends declined to invest, where
upon Mr. Green "cut up nasty" and was
ejected. He was pounding the street
door and emitting unprintable language
when Miss Waterford returned, and
when she asked for an explanation of
h*s behavior he drew a knife of the pro
verbial "ugly-looking" kind and threat
ened to slay her.
"Wld dat yah knife he held me in
hostage," the ladv continued, "an' I
didn't know wot minlt wud be my nex'
till I ducked an' dodged an' g.ot up de
back Btaihway."
Mr. Green denied the knife-brandish
ing accusation, and said he pounded
the door because in his hasty exit It
had been shut on a portion of his coat
tall, holding him prisoner. As to hav
ing lottery tickets in his possession, he
guessed the less he said about that the
better it would be for himself. He was
pronounced guilty of both charges, and
when the Judge's decision was uttered
Miss Waterford chuckled her glee until
Bailiff Hickey silenced her with his re
spect-compelling gavel.
It was not his peddling of lottery
tickets, nor yet his disturbance of the
peace, that brought upon Charles Green
(colored) the wrath of Mis3 Lillian
Waterford (also colored). She had been
on earth long enough to learn that even
the most exemplary character Is not
Immune from police attention, and she
could cheerfully overlook any ordinary
breach of the common laws which Mr.
Green had committed. But his brand
ishing of a knife In her face and threat
ening to carve her with the 'weapon
could never be condoned bo long as she
breathed the breath of life.
Judge Mogan held ] Ed Crawford to
answer a grand larceny charge in the
Superior Court, with bail fixed at $500.
The defendant was accused of stealing
several rolls of canvas from the Oregon
Railroad and Navigation Company's
wharf and an express wagon driver
Identified him as one of three men
who transferred the stolen property
from a boat to a wagon, in which it
was conveyed to the store of a dealer
in ship's supplies. The defense tried to
show that the canvas was afloat when
it was picked up by the men In the

Maggie Mowrie, -./ho spat in the face
of a male visitor who declined to trip
the light fantastic with her In 'a Pa
cific-street dance hall, was adjudged
guilty of vagrancy and will be sen
tenced to-morrow by his Honor Mogan.
Charles Mowrie, the woman's husband,
who was arrested for punching the
face in which his better half had ex
pectorated, proved that he was not a
vagrant, inasmuch as he works every
day as a teamster, and he also con
vinced the court that he does not ap
prove of his wife's calling and vainly
endeavored to get her away from It.
The charge of battery remains, how
ever, and on that he will be tried to
morrow.
Judge Fritz issued an attachment for
the arrest of Harry Mondooly, who ac
cused a Bacon place woman of stealing
$40 from him and then failed to appear
to prosecute her.
As a consequence of his once having
helped the police, the charge of imper
sonating a licensed plumber on which
William Yakowskl was before Judge
Mogan has been dismissed. It was Ya
kowski's information that led to the ar
rest, conviction and execution of three
Russian ex-convicts who murdered the
Weber family in Sacramento about
ten years ago. "The assassins boarded
at the Yakowskl residence.
Charles Kady was convicted of bat
tery on November 18, 1903, and Judge
Fritz sentenced him to fifty days' Im
prisonment. He appealed to the Supe
rior Court and sentence was suspended.
The upper court, however, sustained
the magistrate's action, . and now
Charles Kady must serve his fifty days
âIf the Dollce can find him. The com
plainant was a married woman who ob
jected to his attentions.

Mrs. Annie Speakman, charged with
attempting to murder Mrs. Clara Lefe
vre by cutting her with a carving knife
one day about a month ago, was ready
for trial before Judge Mogan, but again
a continuance was asked for and grant
ed on the ground that Mrs. Lefevre is
unable to appear in court because of
her injuries. The case will be called
again next Saturday. It looks to the
experts as if strenuous effort is being
made to effect a settlement out of
court.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Emma Carroll, vagrant, was saved
from a long term of Imprisonment
through the mediation of "Rebel
George," the evangelist, who persuaded
Judge Fritz to allow the woman to re
turn to the Oakland home of her re
spectable parents. "When I looked at
her face," said the mediator, "I saw
that she was ashamed of herself, and
when I learned that her parents would
not have anything more to do with her
I prayed to the Lord to soften their
hearts. Then I talked to them and
found that my prayer had been an
swered. I have no fear of her back
sliding. Her repentance is keen, she
has found the light and the Lord will
help her."
William "Wilson, who attempted to
transform a Market street saloon Into
a slaughter-house one night two weeks
ago, was fined $25 for carrying brass
knuckles by Judge Cabaniss.
Charles Tehl, a bartender out of a
job, satisfied Judge Mogan that in
ability to obtain employment at his
regular vocation was the sole cause
of his alleged failure to provide for
the support of his minor child. If
there were fewer persons ready to
tend bar or more bars in need of tend
ing Mr. Tehl opined hla family might
have no reason to complain of negli
gence on his part; but the fact was
that the supply of mixologists exceed
ed the demand for mixology. To all
of which the court lent attentive ear
and then desired to be informed If
Mr. Yehl's apparent reluctance to turn
his hand to some other honest means
of bread getting was Incurable. Mr.
Tehl replied that he did not think it
was, and then his Honor suggested
that ha apply the cure as speedily as
possible. "For," added the bench, "I
don't think you would sacrifice more
personal dignity by tackling any Job
you can get than you are losing by
having those dependent upon you for
life's necessaries complaining that you
fail to provide for them."
Subsequently is was ascertained that
the official who Issues the wedding
permits could not be found by the
perspiring Andersons until he return
ed from refreshing the inner man and
then it was too late to have the union
effected unless an exploring expedition
was sent "out in quest of Judge. Mo
gran. The marriage will be pulled off
to-morrow, however, Mr. Benjamin's
incarceration continuing until he Is
pronounced a husband.
So when the case was called and the
Judge heard of the agreement he ad
vised the Andersons to hurry up If
they desired to have the knot tied that
day, as the morning was far advanced
and haste was essential to obtaining

Mere than 4000 persons from this city
visited Schuetzen Park yesterday to
attend the annual picnic of the Youths'
Directory. The directory is an institu
tion founded by the Rev. Father Den
nis O. Crowley and at present presided
over by him. Its object is to rescue
boys of tender years from vicious eur
roundlr.gs and educate them to ideas of
religion. honeEty and industry, instead
of allowing them to become criminals.
To accomplish # these purposes a
school was instituted In this city which
Cld so much good in a reformatory way
that admirers of the institution donat
ed 600 acres of farming land ln Marln
County to the directory. Here the boys
are taught the dignity of labor and the
recompense of industry and many a
youngster has been saved from a crjm
lnal career by this education.
The annual picnic yesterday was the
most successful from a financial and
social standpoint that has ever been
given by the directory. The day was
exceptionally warm, but the trees ln
the park and a grateful breere allayed
most cf the discomfort from the torrid
ireather. An excellent band furnished
music ln the pavilion, which was
crowded all afternoon and evening
with dancers. Interesting games for
young and old were arranged, for
which valuable prizes were offered.
Beven clever little girls participated la
the Jig dancing and each received a
prize. Nearly one hundred gate prizes
of value and utility were awarded
those holding lucky tickets of adxnis
elon. The picnic was under the direct
supervision of Father Morgan, assist
ant to Father Crowley. He was every
Â¦where, welcoming the coming and
speeding the parting guest. Everything
In his power he did to see that those
attending enjoyed the day's outing.

TURN OVER TTME
When Nature Hlnta About the Food.
When there's no relish to any food
and all that one eats doesn't seem to
do any rood then Is the time to make
a turn over ln the diet, for that* s Na-
ture's way of dropping a hint that the
food isn't the kind required.
"For a number of years I followed
railroad work, much of It being: office
work of a trying nature. Meal times
were onr busiest and eating too much
and too quickly of food such as is
commonly served ln hotels and restau-
rants, these together with the seden-
tary habits were not long In giving me
dyspepsia and stomach trouble, which
reduced ray weight from 205 to 160
pounds.
"There was little relish in any food
and none of it seemed to do me any
good. It seemed the more I ate the
poorer I got and was always hungry
before another meal, no matter how
much I had eaten.
'Then I commenced a fair trial of
Grape-Nuts and was surprised how a
small saucer of it would carry me
along, strong and with satisfied appe-
tite, until the next meal, with no sen-
sations of hunger, weakness or dis-
tress as before.
"I have been following this diet now
for several months and my improve-
ment has been so great all the others
in my family have taken up the use
of Grape-Nut* with complete satisfac-
tion and much improvement In health
and brain power.
"American people undoubtedly eat
hurriedly, have lots of worry, thus
hindering digestion and therefore need
a food that is predlg*ested and concen-
trated in nourishment." Name given

Fourth of July Committee.
The City Bacteriologist urged that
an ordinance prohibiting the sale of
milk that contains more than 30,000
bacteria in each cubic centimeter be
passed. The committee took the view
that if the sanitary requirements were
adhered to in the handling of milk
there would be no need of passing leg
islation regarding germs, as the milk
would of a certainty be pure if the
regulations are obeyed.
The Supervisors' Hospital and
Health Committee, yesterday reported
in favor of the passage of an ordin
ance embodying the rules and regu
lations adopted by the Board of
Health for the proper conduct of
dalrfes'with a view to their being kept
in sanitary condition. Chief Inspect
ing Physician Hassler urged the pass
age of the ordinance, saying that. It
was only by such a measure that the
Health Board could carry out its pol
icy to secure pure milk for the inhab
itants of this city.
The committee also decided to re
quest the Printing. Committee to allow
a sufficient sum of money to print the
sanitary regulations so that the dairy
men may become familiar with the or
dinance.

The proceedings in which Vander
bilt's testimony is desired were brought
against Richard A. Cfcnfleld by the
District Attorney in an endeavor to
show that Canfleld was the proprietor
of a gambling-house.
NEW YORK. June 11.â Believing that
Reginald Vanderbllt, upon whom rep
resentatives of the District Attorney's
office for several months have unsuc
cessfully endeavored to serve a subpena
compelling him to appear as a witness
in criminal proceedings against Rich
ard A. Canfleld, is in this city, detec
tives have been stationed around the
Neilson resfd'ence on Fifth avenue since
last evening.
When it was reported yesterday that
young Vanderbilt had suddenly left
Philadelphia, where he had been for
several weeks, a thorough search of the
places in this city frequently visited by
him was begun by a detective armed
with a subpena. After a careful but
fruitless search the detective evidently
concluded that Vanderbilt, if really In
the city, was at the residence of his
mother-in-law, Mrs. Neilson, on Fifth
avenue, and an all-night vigil In the
vicinity of the mansion was begun.
Nothing developed during the night,
but to-day the detectives succeeded In
slipping into the house past a maid
while the latter was picking up the
morning papers at the door. A moment
later, however, the detective ia said to
have met determined opposition in the
form of another servant, who demand
ed the intruder's business.
When the detective replied that he
desired to see Vanderbilt he was In
formed that Vanderbilt waa not in the
house. The detective was ordered from
the premises by the negro, and on leav
ing again took up. his station on the
opposite side of the street. Later a sec
ond attempt was made by two detec
tives to enter the house. A butler an
swered the bell, but when asked if Reg
inald Vanderbilt. rwas in promptly
slammed the door.

MAKING AUCTION SALES.
Baldwin & Howell have taken the
preliminary steps to turn 'Into a resi
dence park the Tibbits tract of nln?
acres, bordering the Presidio reserva
tion between First -and Third avenues.
This tract was recently purchased by a

close the property, provide winding
roadways so that lots will get the best
available \iews of the park, the* Pre
sidio and the avenues, erect a lodge and
imposing gateway at Second avenue,
lay out the property on landscape gar
dening lines, reserve the area exclu
sively for private residences, excluding
all stables, outbuildings and places of
business, and have the park managed
by a board of trustees. Residence parks
elsewhere have been favored. Baldwin
& Howell believe that the project
briefly outlined in the foregoing will be
successful in San Francisco.

LONDON. June 11. â A magnificent
collection of snuff boxes and minia
tures which belonged to the late Duke
of Cambridge has been auctioned at
Christie's. The most interesting con
test was the keenly contested fight for
a Louis Quinze gold snuff box, with
panels of sporting subjects' in poly
chrom enamel. The bidding began
at JiOD and rose slowly to $10,000, at
â¢which the coveted bauble was
knocked down to a collector.

LONDON, June 11. â John Alexan
der Dowle arrived here to-day from
Holland and made a tour of the ho
tels, accompanied by his wife and son
and escorted by deacons, in search of
accommodations. Everywhere he met
with refusal, as the hotel managers
are afraid of a repetition of the row
dyism which marked Dowie's former
stay here. Ultimately, being unable
to find lodgings, Dowle proceeded to
the Zionist headquarters. The head
quarters have been connected with
the police by telephones, in anticipa
tion of a possible onslaught by & mob.

DOW1E DENIED ROOM
IX HOTELS OF LONDON
"If Kubelik had a crooked nose and
the critic mentioned it that would not
have been an Insult." The -verdict of
the court is. therefore, acquittal."
BERLIN. June 11.â "Suit dlsmiraed
Â¦nith costs for the plaintiff" was the
vcrCict of the court yesterflay at
l"rankfort-on-the-Maln in the suit
which Kubelik, the violinist, brought
against Dr. Gehrmann, the music
critic of the Frankfurter Zeltuns. for
what the violinist deemed insulting
personalities in criticisms of his con
certs. Dr. Gehrmann described Ku
belik as a "stupid-looking man
(bloefie drelnschauenden)." of effem
inate appearance, and spoke of him
also Â»s a "pecialist and "miracle
worker who produced nothing but
tones."
The proceedings turned partly upon
the meaning of the word "bloede,"
Â¦which experts testified was used In
North Germany in the sense of "shy"
or "expressionless," and the court not
ed that Dr. Gehrmann came from
Berlin to Frankfort. But Herr
Schwarrschild. Kubelik's lawyer, saw
in the word that offensive personali
ties characterizing Berlin musical
criticism were being introduced. The
Frankfort lawyer also objected to the
word "specialist." which he claimed
was only applicable to a variety per
former. Dr. Gehrmann's defense of
the word "bloede" was that he only
meant to say that Kubelik riveted his
eyes on one epot when playing.
The presiding Judge then took a
hand In the proceedings and pointed
out that he possessed a pamphlet
written against Wagner during the
gTeat composer's lifetime and designed
to show that Wagner was crazy. Yet
Wagner never brought suit against his
critics. The Judge also claimed that
Kubelik invited criticisms on his per
sonal appearance by having full length
portraits of himse'.f displayed In shop
windows as advertisements.
The court in explaining the reasons
for the dismissal of the suit said the
word "â¢specialist" was Justified, since
Kubelik "cultivated the breakneck
l<?ature of a Paganini," adding:
"It Is now customary for critics to
describe the personal appearance of
artists for their readers who were not
{.resent at the concert, and Kubelik
probably would have been better sat
isfied if the personal description had
been more flattering."
The court also said that the expres
sion "bloede" was not insulting, and
added:

PLACER CLAIMSâ C. L., Latrobe.
Cal. Claims usually called "placer,"
embracing all forms of deposit ex
cepting veins of quartz or other rock
in place, are subject to entry and
patent under like circumstances and
conditions and, upon similar proceed
ings as are provided for vein or lode
claims, but where the lands have been
previously surveyed by the United
States the entry in its exterior limits
shall conform to* the 1-^al conditions
as to public lands. But one discovery
of mineral is- required to support a
placer location, whether it be of ten
acres by one individual or of 160 or
less by an association of persons. No
claims ' shall exceed 160 acres. The
taking up of placer claims is governed
by Land Office regulations. A party
desiring' to take up a placer claim
should apply to the nearest United
States Land Office.

ARMY CHAPLAINâ M. D., City.
The Federal law says that an appli
cant for appointment as chaplain in
the United States army mu3t bz a
regularly ordained minister of some
religious denomination in good stand
ing at the time of his appointment
and he must be recommended for such
appointment by seme ecclesiastical
body or by not less than five ministers
of the same denomination. A later
law says: "No person shall be ap
pointed a chaplain In the regular army
who shall have passed the age of 40.
nor until he has established hia fit
ness as required by existing laws."
And still another law says that this
latter provision shall not apply to such
as served as chaplain In the volunteer
service if at the time of appointment
in such volunteer service the appointee
was under 42 years" of age.

Not only the engineers, but also the
doctors, will have much work to do in
connection with the construction of the
Panama canal. The health conditions
in the vicinity are very badâ it would
be difficult to find worse. The Chagres
fever, which is peculiar to this region
being named, indeed, after the river of
that name â prevails constantly and is a
very serious menace to the lives of men
from the north. I am confident that it
can be stamped out, but this will be a
difficult task, well worthy of the efforts
of the best medical ability in this coun
try.
The climate itself is not unfavorable
to health. The danger lies in the
swamps on the coast and in the abso
lute lack of sanitation in the towns.
The swamps will have to be drained
and a civilized sanitary system put into
operation. This work must be put un
der the direction of a medical man of
firmness, sound ideas and strong ex
ecutive ability. Though the manual la
bor on the canal will be done by accli
mated natives, a large number of men
from the United States will be em
ployed as superintendents and for other
work requiring skill and education.
Many young American civil and
mechanical engineers are looking to
Panama for opportunities, and there
will be places for a considerable propor
tion of those who want- them. The lives
of these men are too valuable to be
sacrificed to unhealthful conditions that
can be remedied. Some of the first and
most important undertakings in the
canaljjo'untry must be prosecuted i by
physicians. â Success.

HOWARD M. KUTCHIN, special agent of the De
partment of Commerce and Labor for the in
spection of the Alaskan salmon fisheries, has
embodied in his report for the year 1903, which is now
published by the department, an intelligent review of
the operation of the fishing laws in Alaskan waters and
some strongly emphasized advice upon the perpetuation
ot the salmon .supply through hatcheries. He warmly
seconds the recommendation made by the special Fish
Commission last summer that the Government under
take the work of propagation. 1
"Artificial propagation â these two words," says
Kutchin, "to my mind embody the solution of the vexed
question of the perpetuation of the Alaska salmon fish
eries, and it may be stated with equal brevity that the
attempt of the Government to exact that this work be
done by the packers of the salmon has been, and must
continue to be, ,a failure. Suffice it to say that out of
about forty companies and individuals engaged in the
packing business only a single oneâ the Alaska Packers'
Association â has gone into hatchery effort with any
thing like earnest purpose and thorough business-like
method, and even this concern by no means covers the
territory in which it operates nor produces an approxi
mate percentage of the ratio called for by the hatchery
regulation."
The scarcity of 'fish has begun to make itself manifest
in the season's total output. In his statistical report
Air. Ktitchin shows that, whereas the output of 1902
from all the concerns aggregated 2,631,320 cases, that of
the last season amounted to only 2,361,782 cases, a fall
ing off of 269,538 cases, representing a loss of 12% per
cent. In the Central Alaskan region about the Cooks
Inlet and Prince William Sound waters th*i salmon runs
have been noticeably short. Some of the more rare and
valued species of the fish are being diminished to the
extent of an enforced suspension of packing in those
brands. â¢ '.'.
Not to the decreasing numbers of the fish alone is
due the threatened shortage 'in supply, but also to the
frequent violation of the'fish laws in force along Alaskan
waters. Though the special agent declares in his re
port that the laws are obeyed in the- main with about
as great an observance as any law. commands, he cites
frequent and flagrant violation of the measure which
prohibits the seining of more, than one-third of a
stream's waterway. Some â¢ unscrupulous canneries,
which, in the absence of the inspectors, fence in an
entire stream with wire netting, do much .to destroy the
fish supply.
From the reading of the special agent's report and a
consideration of* the report made by; the special Fish
Commission appointed to investigate the methods of
the canneries in Alaska last summer it appears- that *if
the wealth of the Alaska canneries' is to continue un
impaired, the fish packers themselves must see to it that
every regulation made by the Government is stringently
enforced., If they are. prodigal with their supply now
they can blame nobody but themselves- should the ex
haustion of the salmon force suspension of business
in the future. Â¦ - ! 5' : *

Turkey has agreed, it is reported, to permit the Black

that he is giving the invitation his
very careful consideration. Everything

Evidently Beerbohm Tree has an eye
on'the patronage of the many Ameri

thinks so from the fact that he is to
follow "The Darling of the Gods,"
which will be played for the last time
on May 30, with three Thakespearean
revivals. Sir Henry Irving's last few
spring revivals at the old Lyceum were
supported almost entirely by Ameri
cans, and there should be much patron

froi the same quarter, for the three
pieces which he means to revive,
"Julius Caesar," "Twelfth Night" and
"A Midsummer-Night's Dream," are
among those which be dc:j best. In

as much to the British taste as it had

HEADQUARTERS OF THE CALL,
5 HENRIETTA STREET, COVENT
GARDEN*. LONDON. May 29.âUn
doubtedly the reception accorded to
"The Prince of PUsen"â presented herÂ©
for the first time the other evening
has been fully described In the tele
graphic dispatches. Reports from the
United States, however, makÂ» it evident
that the latest experiment â¢with Ameri
can, musical comedy In London Is being
awaited with considerable curiosity at
home, eo It may not be out of place
to go somewhat Into details regarding
the situation. It will be remembered
that this is the beginning of an at
tempt to provide London with the be^t
musical plays that the United States
can produce. George Musgrove, the
manager of the Shaftesbury, where
"The Prince of Pilsen" is now running,
announced recently that he had made
a start by securing three pieces that
had enjoyed favor In the United States
âthe present production, "The Yankee
Consul." and "Peggy From Paris," and
that if the opening attraction failed to
do business it would be shelved In
favor of the second, and so on until
he found a winner. Â« Americans In Lon
don watted for the outcome with par
ticular interest, for it is. of course, a
fact that since "The Belle of New
York" no American musical play
has found luck In London. It
is also- true that not one of
the plays sent over had been
a real success at home.- Judging from
the fact that it had run nearly two
years in the United States, it was felt,
hcrwever. that "The Prince of Pilsen"
should afford a fairer test. Well. "The
Prince" has been presented, and, it
must be confessed, has fared uncom
mop badly at the hands of the review
ers. They find it less well mounted
than the plays of this kind presented
by George Edwardes, of uncommon
feebleness in liberetto, more meritori
ous so far as music is cc-ncerned. but â
not so very funny! John VT. Ransome,
on arriving in London, was asked by
an interviewer if he would not anglicise
his part a little, so as to make it more
understandable by Britishers. The re
ply was "I won't change a single line."
Present indications are that this was
a mistake, for on the first night the
comedian's famous "catch-phrase" fell
rather flat. "Vas you ever in Cincin
nati?" â the constant inquiry of the
American brewer in the play â tickled
audiences at hc-me: here it is just as
funny as it would be in the United
States if an Englishman asked "Were
you ever tn Birmingham?" The much
heralded "Song of the Cities" also
proved rather mystifying to London
ers, and this might have been ex
pected. What significance could it be
supposed to have, for instance, if the
band played "Maryland" to announce
the arrival of the Baltimore girl, when
f*his tune is absolutely unknown to an
English audience? In such respects
"The Prince of Pilsen" may prove too
American to succeed in London, in
others it is voted not American enough.
The scene in Nice â there Is little, If any,
American local color; nothing quaint
to English eyes, as there proved to
be in "Dahomey." So It Is being asked
why it was worth while to bring all
this distance a play so much like the
home-made article? However, it is for
the public to say whether the next Item
on Mr. Musgrove's list shall, or shall
not.-- be long delayed.

A series of interesting firing trials re
cently was undertaken by the Swedish
Government. The purpose of these ex
periments waa to examine the effect of
shooting against pasteooara. The trials
were conducted on the wharves of the
Swedish navy in Karlskrons, and the
target used was a prepared one of mill
board, against which fire from revolv
ers, rifles, carbines and machine guns
was directed. The pasteooard, which
was three inches thick, resisted com
pletely the bullets fired from the small
arms, but was perforated by the pro
jectiles from the machine guns. The
experiments may be said to have given
very interesting results. Bullets fro-m

'â¢When a boy 10 years cf'age I was
one of the great crowd of his neighbors
and friends who assembled at the
Wabash depot in Springfield in Febru
ary. 1861. and heard him bid farewell
to his neighbors and friends in a speech
tinged with sadness, but with Christian
hope."
"Mr. Lincoln, "as I recall, invariably
wore a high, hat, co-mmonly called a
â¢plug' hat. During the time of his
great debates with Douglas and Just
preceding and after his nomination for
the Presidency, Mr. Lincoln was much
preoccupied in mind.- When at home
he usually went up to the State House
after his evening meal to consult with
his party associates. He was quite
regular in his habits and usually came
back about 8:30 in the evening. His
habits were si/ well fixed that the boys
could calculate on his movements, and
we tied a string from the tree to the
fence at Just such a height as.to strike
Mr. Lincoln's plug hat about the cen
ter. We hid ourselves behind the fence
in the adjoining yard, behind the wall
around the corner, and In various
places.
"When Mr. Lincoln, with his arms
folded behind his back and evidently
in deep thought, would be suddenly
aroused by having his hat knocked off
by some unseen power we would raise
a mighty yell, rush out from our hiding
places, grab hold of him wherever we
could find a place and shout for Joy.
All his serious thoughts would vanish
instantly and he would laugh and romp
with us, and not unfrequently march
up the street with all the boys cling
ing around 'him until he could find a
place-to buy us some nuts or fruit.
! Senator Dubols delivered an address
'at the Soldiers* Home in Boise,^Idaho,
recently, in which he related some per
sonal reminiscences- of Lincoln, which
throw a strong light upon the lovable
character of the martyred President. .
"In my boyhood," said Senator Du
bols "my family lived almost directly
across the street from Mr. Lincoln. He
had two sons, William and Thomas,'
nicknamed 'Tad,' who were about the
same age as my brother. Dr. Jesse K.,
and myself. We. with the other boys of
' the- neighborhood, used to gather on

the music hall's feature, which he
thinks will be exceedingly bright.
Chevalier has been making a long tour
of the United Kingdom and has been
struck especially by the immense pat
ronage which the "halls" In. the large
cities roceive and by the immensely im
proved tone of the performance given
asveompared with the kind of thing in
vogue when he first entered \ the busi
ness. . Â¦ -
"I foresee a time," he said to an .in
terviewer, "when distinguished drama
tists like Mr. Pinero will be glad, to
write little one-act plays for the halls,
and some of the finest actors of the
day will give character impersonations
there which will be perfect works of
art. The modern music hall is only a
youth yet. but he shows signs that
promise a fine maturity, and. I have
every confidence in him. I believe that
he will brighten and elevate the lives
of the people in a way that the stage
could not, because it could, not reach
them, and at the same time it will
prove a boon to the stage itself."
The system was undoubtedly transferred from Penn
sylvania to . Idaho. The only difference was the more
open commission of its crimes. Local officers were en
tirely controlled by it, and a hundred murders and vast
destruction of property occurred, with no attempt to
check or punish the perpetrators. The Governor of
Idaho, whose honorable fame will increase with years,
at last called .for Federal troops and cleared out the
criminals. The local officials were deposed and since
his work was finished the district has been peaceful and
prosperous. The State of Colorado has lost nearly
$25,000,000 by the domestication of the Idaho refugees
in her mining region, and Governor Peabody is now
taking the. same measures that were necessary in Idaho,
except that the State militia has proved itself trust
worthy and Federal troops are not necessary. When
the Eastern people point to these events in two Western
.mining States, and profess great concern about them, it
is only necessary to remind them of the Molly Maguires
in the old State of Pennsylvania.
It is the duty of the State to enforce the law, and when
the local officers are in the combination of its violators
they'must be deprived of their functions. , The fact that
life and property are made unsafe by a society or organ
ization, whose members destroy both does not sanctify
the crime. Take the case of the Mormon church as an
illustration. It is fixed in our constitutional policy that
the; state must not interfere with religion. To do so
would be an invasion of that liberty of conscience which
is essential to free government. When such interference
takes place civil liberty is at an end. But if a religious
society have a policy that is necessarily destructive of
civil liberty it cannot plead its religious character in
avoidance of punishment by the state. Government de
fends itself in* defending the rights of person and prop
erty, and ir. enforcing the law against those wlio defy
it, be they, secular or religicus societies. If the Mormon
church defy the law of the land in its practices, it be
comes liable to exactly the same treatment dealt out
to the. Molly Maguires in Idaho and Colorado.
Without any desire t6 inject partisanship into this dis
cussion, we may note the evidence that the influence of
both secular and religious law-breakers is apparent in
one of the great parties in the States named. The
Democratic convention of Idaho refused to send as a
delegate to the National Convention the great Democrat
who as Governor enforced the law and punished and
banished the - Molly Maguires. The refusal was upon
the express ground that he did enforce the law. The
State convention of the same party in Utah, under the
influence of the religious society that breaks the law,
refused to make any expression on the subject of po
lygamy.
These incidents only serve to disclose the perils of
the state when secular or religious societies array
themselves against the law. Where suffrage is universal
tl?e ballot, which was intended to preserve the rights of
person and property and to maintain the law, becomes
the instrument to destroy what it was intended to de
fend.
It is conceivable that in Utah the same measures may
some day have to be taken against the Mormon church
that have been- taken against the Molly Maguires in
Idaho and Colorado. Of course such measures cause
many pitiful Â¦, No person 'is more pitiable
than one who suffers the penalty of contumacy that
originates in a perverted conscience. The miscreants
who' dynamited to death nearly a score of men in
Colorado recently felt no conscientious scruples. Their
Molly Maguire oath had come to be the only binding
obligation they felt. They know no state, no govern
ment, except their own murderous instincts.
So, too, when about the same time President Smith
of/the -Mormon church in his address to the young peo
ple of his church declared that he would continue' to
defy' the law by living with his five wives there was ex
pressed a religious conscience and the obligation of a
secret- oath, all superior to any civil obligation. He
knows no state and no government. The perverted
â¢practices of his religion are the sole guides of his con
duct. These things center the struggle for law and gov
ernment in the West. As both have prevailed over their
secular Â¦enemies, so they will over those who defy them
in the name of religion, though every Mormon have to
â¢^be banished .frorn the country.
The Molly Maguircs in the coal region of Pennsyl
vania were for years a terror. They committed hun
dreds of murders. If a mine foreman became obnoxious
he was soon found dead. If a mine owner incurred the
wrath of the'inner council he was assassinated. If a fel
low-workman was disagreeable or refused to yield to
some exaction his corpse was found in the mine. Fi
nally detectives joined the Mollies and patiently gath
ered evidence. It was found that sheriffs and even
judges on the bench were Mollies, and that they had
participated in murders and had acquitted their accom
plices when brought before them. When the
was gathered, the legal hanging began and in about two
years the^ Mollies had 'expiated their crimes on â¢the. gal
lows, or were in'prison or exile.
rpHE Mormon question in Utah and the disturbance
I â¢ in the mining districts of Colorado bring the West
â¢*Â¦ to the center of the stage. The mining troubles
that, so long disturbed. the Coeur d'Alene district in Idaho,
and after suppression there by the same means now em
ployed by Governor Pcabody, were transferred. to Colo
rado,' are recognized at once as Molly Maguireism in an
aggravated form.- .
However, it is not at all likely the public will see in
the issue anything more than the absurdity involved in
the appearance of the War Department in the role of a
marriage bureau. It will seem much like a revival of
the' "Courts of Love" that used to be held in the .ro
mantic days of old, when knights and troubadours were
summoned to answer before the pink tea dames of those
times for any alleged failure of doing their "devoirs"
to beauty. Doubtless there has been some personal
animosity back of the force that has been pressing this
case to an issue, but the officials of the War Depart
ment should not permit even that. force to impel them to
commit the absurdity of commanding an officer to come
before a court-martial and â¢ explain â¢ why he does not
marry a girl whom he does not wish to marry.
people as being very dignified, even when tried before
civil c6urts that are accustomed to them, and a breach of
promise court-martial be almost certain to strike
the popular mind in about the same way as a novelty
stunt at a vaudeville show. The War Department is sup
posed to be better fined for directing the stratagems and
the armaments of Mars than for regulating the pranks
of Cupid, and the absurdity of the thing would overcome
the gravity of even those who were most fully conscious
of the real seriousness of the issue.
As a matter of fact the issue! is a serious one. It is
not too much to say that nearly the .whole prosperity
of the private lives of^ men and women is made oV
marred by marriage". If there be anything- in which in
dividual responsibility should be left free to the dictates
of personal love and honor, surely it is that of the choice
of a partner for life. Of course where wrong has been
done there should be a means of righting it, but in such
cases as the one under review, where no dishonor is
alleged, the individual has a right to claim immunity
from supervision and dictation by any governmental au
thority whatever.

When the policeman arrived the
crowd broke and ran. All made* their
escape. Goodnight sustained several
severe lacerations of the head, face
and body and may have internal inju
ries. Goodnight recognized some of
his assailants as union men he saw
hanging around the freight sheds dur
ing the afternoon.
Goodnight arrived in town yester
day morning from Yuma, Ariz., to go
to work in the Southern Pacific freight
sheds at Fourth and Townsend streets.
He put in half a day and in the even
ing repaired to. hunt for a room.
While on Fourth street, which was
crowded at the time, he was set upon
by half a dozen men and knocked
down, kicked and brutally beaten.
But for the prompt arrival of Police
man Philpot the unfortunate man
might have been kicked to death.
Frank Price, a watchman employed
by the Southern Pacific Company in
the freight sheds at Townsend street,
was taken to the Central Emergency
Hospital last night and treated by
Dr. Boskowitz for numerous abrasions
and contusions about the head and
face. According to the story told by
Price he was crossing Fourth and
Brannan streets when ten striking
freight handlers assaulted him. On
the approach of two patrolmen the
thugs took to their heels and made
their escape.
Charles M. Goodnight, a non-union
freight handler, was nearly beaten to
death by union , sympathizers on
Fourth street, near Bryant, last night.
Goodnight was removed to the Har
bor Hospital, where his injuries were
dressed. He .will recover.

While at the Emergency Hospital
she claimed that her husband was a
party to the assault, but this was dis
proved by the police investigation. In
the meantime King secured a divorce
from her, the decree. being granted a
few days ago. This and other causes
may "have had a tendency to upset the
woman's mind.' She will be examined
by the Insanity Commissioners to
morrow.
Mrs. King was' picked up at 3
o'clock in the morning of May 21 at
Fourteenth and Market streets by Po
lice Officer Lycett of the Mission dis
trict and was taken to the Emergency
Hospital for treatment for several
contused wounds- on the head and
face, with a possible fracture of the
skull. From the Emergency Hospital
she was sent to the City and County
Hospital, where she remained until
last Sunday,. when she. was discharged.
On her return. to her mother's home
she showed symptoms of insanity,
supposedly from the effects of the
beating she received.
Annie I. King, the divorced wife of
Charles King, an advertising agent for
the local theaters, was placed in the

The Princess of Wales
Recommended and Used by Crowned Heads
The Princess of Wales and probable future Queen of England
:s a most charming and cultivated womanly woman.
She possesses all those essentially feminine attributes that lend
grace and digmity and attractiveness to positions of power and au-
thority. While nowise deficient in radiant matronly pride, her fig-
ure, though petite, is perfect â her carriage stately and pleasing
â her eyes sparkling and vivacious â and her hair lustrous, lovely
and luxuriant. Like all European women of high station, she pays
constant and careful attention to the growth, adornment and care
of her hair. American women will do well to follow her example.
Half the charm of woman, no matter in what position her lot
is cast, is the beauty, strength and lustre of her hair. â¢ â¢ â¢
How needful it is therefore to study every method of beautify-
ing and stimulating its growth.

on Police Judge Cabaniss again yes
terday morning to get the Judge's
signature to warrants for. the arrest of
Hutton and Policemen Barry and Fen

The Judge said he had seen Hutton
and had_ explained the situation, but
Hutton wanted time to look up au

Collins that the matter of the Issu
ance of the warrants be laid over till
to-morrow and meantime he would
hear from Hutton.

When the testimony was all In,! In- J

would have said If they had' been pres
ent, the . Harbor Commissioners an
nounced ' that they - would ' decide - all .
three cases next Tuesday afternoon at {
2 o'clock. ' Â¦ Â¦ ' |
OTHER CASES HEARD.
When the arguments had been heard,
the matter was taken under - advise- I
ment, the board proceeding, with the !
testimony ln the other cases. Lercari
repeated in substance the complaint
filed against the American Produce '
Company. He said'that when he had
offered to buy of B. C. Daltdn twenty
boxes of potatoes, Dal ton, representing
the American Produce Company, had
refused to sell.' Dal ton was quoted as
saying that the reason for his refusal
was found In the rules of the Produce j
Dealers' Association. Messrs. Baciga- j
lupl and Pierretti,- witnesses in the pre
ceding case, corroborated the state
ments of L*rcarL r . .
Dalton, when called as a witness, tes
tified that he had no other reason and
gave no - other j reason â¢ for not- selling
twenty boxes except that he did not
wish to break a lot. ; . .--;
In the case against L. Scatena & Co.,
Pierretti and Lercari testified that the '
sale of twenty boxes of potatoes had f
been refused on the ground of asso
ciation rules. ...
Daniel Smith, representative of . L.
Scatena & Co., denied on the witness
stand that he had made any statement
that association rules had anything to
do with the i transaction, . or that any
money was placed in- his .hands" with
which to payfor twenty bo:tes. George
L. Burt, also an employe of ,L. Scatena
& Co., corroborated â¢ the testimony of.
Smith. - ' I ;
Reinstein again contended that all"
that had happened was that, attempts â¢
had been made.- to' buy small lots at
wholesale prices from Wolf & Son. .He
complained that the Harbor Commis- ;
sloners, by setting up. a rule that '-a u
very small number. of sacki," or boxes
of potatoes or onions should be sold
to every solvent bidder who wished to
so purchase, were practically estab-.
lishlng a retail basis on the State's .
wharves for firms who are wholesalers. '
Reinstein also called the attempt to .
buy a comparatively small lot of goods
from Wolf & Son a trick. There had
been no discrimination if every one was
treated alike, he said. . j
Attorney Wise denied promptly that
there had been any trick. He said that
the argument of Reinstein â¢Â¦â¢ was the
most evasive. and his defense the most
absurd that he had ever heard. To
this" somewhat warm -beginning Wise'
keyed much of his remarks. He called
attention to an agreement j Reinstein"
had filed, in which the produce dealers
In the combine had set forth that it
was their purpose to conform to the
Woodward law in their organization.
Ninety-five per cent of the dealers had,
according to Reinstein,- agreed to obey
the law. Wise said, and he grew quite
sarcastic over this and - proposed that
a monument to Wolf & Son should,
therefore, be erected on the wharf
where the transaction of which Ler- j
carl complained -took place. , j

did not have anything to do with regu
latlng.the quantity of perishable prod- i
uce to be sold . to any purchaser or i

An Excellent 'Opportunity
Jay Federlein, a theatrical advertis
ing agent, was suffocated early yester
day morning by illuminating gas that
escaped from a partly open, burner in
his room at 887 Bush street. His sister,
Carrie Jacobs, went to the bathroom at
7:15 o'clock yesterday morning and
found the place full of the fumes of
gas. A light is kept burning very low
ln the bathroom all night. Miss Jacobs
found that the light had been extin
guished, either by a sudden current of
alf or by something In the pipes. As
she was passing her brother's room she
detected the odor of gas, and opening
the door found him lying dead in his
night shirt 'on top of the bed covers,
with a magazine by his side, which he
had been reading when he fell asleep.
Gas was issuing from a partly opened
burner ln the room. The indications are
that while he was asleep a sudden dimi
nution of pressure in the flow or a gust
of air extinguished the light.
Federlein was a native of Illinois,. 41
years old and unmarried. He was for
merly proprietor of the Dally Shipping
and Hotel* IJews. His nephew, Harry
Jacobs, ha<f1f narrow escape from death

Henry Schwartz, 22 Franklin street,
Oakland, had that tired feeling early
yesterday morning, and, after takin off
his shoes, stretched himself out on a
bench ln the ferry building to have a
nap. When he awoke about 6 o'clock
he discovered that some one had stolen
his shoes and had also taken $3 out
of his pockets. He made a complaint
to the police.

As on the first day of the hearing of
these cases the produce conynission
men of the two rival camps were
strongly ip . evidence, notwithstanding
the- rush of the Saturday trade. Those
who are in the combine were less nu
merous in the Commissioners' com
fortable leather-backed cnairs than
were those merchants, to the number
of_ more .than a score of firms, who
withdrew from the Produce Dealers'
Protective Association. There was no
difference in the degree of interest on
either side. One part of the audience
was. pleased when Attorney Reinstein
said fiercely that there was nothing to
the cases brought by Lercari and
others. Then the other side smiled
when Attorney Otto Wise thumped thft
table In front of him with astonish
ing vigor, considering the warm
weather, and <".enounc?d Attorney Rein
stein in various phrases of attack.
Reinstein opened the argument. His
principal point was that there had been
no discrimination against the present
complainants, who had tried in vain
to buy certain limited quantities of po
tatoes and onions from the three de
fendant firms and had been refused the
RIVAL CAMrS. PRESENT.
The. Harbor Commissioners will de
cide next Tuesday arternc-on whether
they will take away from Wolf & Son,
L. Scatena & Co. and the. American
Produce Company the permits issued
under the Woodward law, by virtue of
which these firms are permitted to sell
perishable products on tne property of
the State in this city.
Several hours were consumed yes
terday in taking testimony relative to
alleged violations of the Woodward law
by the two firms last mentioned and in
listening to the arguments of counsel
on the charges against Wolf & Son.
Stipulations concerning what, should
be entered upc-n the record shortened
the testimony very materially and the
general understanding that arguments
would be brief tended to keep the at
torneys within a time limit. Still the
atmosphere was torrid in more ways
than one, and when noon arrived the
Commissioners and the perspiring at
torneys were entirely willing to take
time to cool^f and to think over the
matters at issue. .

Aoyagi expects to remain here for a
couple of weeks. He will then proceed
eastward, hoping before his mission is
ended to have crossed the Atlantic to
England. In referring to the war and
the advance on Port Arthur, j Aoyagi
said It was expected when he left
Yokohama that Port Arthur would be
in the hands of the Japanese within
a period of eight weeks. These have
nearly elapsed.
L Aoyagi of the Japanese Depart
ment of Agriculture, who has been
commissioned by his Government to in
vestigate all matters In this country
and British Columbia relating to the
migration of Japanese to this coast,
arrived here yesterday from the Orient
by way of Victoria and is registered at
the Occidental. His coming to the
United States was brought about by
the recent antagonistic comments here
and in the British province on the sub
ject of Japanese competition in the la
bor markets. He will begin his in;
quiries immediately.
During a conversation yesterday
Aoyagi said his Government was in no
way encouraging its_.subjects to force
themselves on any other people. A3 a
matter of fact, he said Japan is re
stricting the emigration of skilled and
unskilled laborers and is only Issuing
passports to merchants, students and
those of the other higher classes.
"If it is a fact, as claimed," said he,
"that laborers are still coming into
your country, there perhaps is some
evasion of our laws, which it will be
my duty to discover during my investi
gation. I will make a close study of the
legislative questions bearing directly on
Japanese immigration. If I find condi
tions t that suggest wherein our laws
should b"e made more strict in order to
keep our people at home it Is very
likely that my report to that effect will
be carefully weighed by the legislative
bodies of Japan and the law remod
eled."
XVheelan spoke of the good result ob
tained even from the temporary cru
sade against Impure milk that was
started by . Inspector Dockery several
years ago. saying that Dockery's work
had noticeably reduced the infant mor
tality rate all over the city. From this
he argued that systematic work, by the
Health Board in enforcing sanitary
conditions at dairies and distributing
centers would save a great number of
infant lives now sacrificed because of
the -filthy surroundings from which the
ttilk is carried to city homes. - '
On motion of Fairfax H. Wheelan,
one cf the directors, a resolution was
adopted indorsing the work of the
Board of Health and of Health Officer
Ragan In their crusade for pure milk,
and Secretary White was Instructed
to communicate this action to the offi
cials of the municipal health depart-*
ment-
The monthly report of Secretary M.

It shows that the work or the society

On May 29 a dozen small children
were playing in an Oakland street
they saw a heavily loaded mar
ket wagon bearily rapidly down on
them. All of the youngsters escaped
to the sidewalk in sarety except the
little Brunje girl, who was seated In
a toy wagon ani could not get away.
The oncoming team was within a few
yards of thÂ» child when Janvrin, who
*vas working near by, saw her danger.
At the risk cf :Â»is own life he dashed
in font of the horses and lifting her
from the little vehicle bore her safely
aside. The child's wagon was instantly
smashed by the feet of the horses.
In recommending the award of the
medal to Janvrin. President Newhall
voiced the tentiinent of all the direc
tors present when he declared that the
society took especial pleasure In ac
knowledging this act of heroism on
the part of a laborer, untrained in
rescue work, whose presence of mind
and quickness of movement had saved
the life of the child, ev<n at the risk
of death to himself.
of the bronze medal of the California
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty

of the society yesterday It was voted,
on motion of President E. W. New

brave act.

A peculiar business transaction. In
which Celina B. Pechin. a public school
tÂ«acher of this city, was a principal
was the subject of an opinion ren
dered by the Supreme Court yester
day. The decision incidentally bene
fits her to the -extent of $5000. The
contest was instituted by the execu
trix of the estate of Horace Gasquet.
The parents of Mrs. Pechin and the
Gasquet family were for many years
neighbors and friends in Crescent
City. Del Norte County. Gasquet had
frequently promised the young school
teacher that he would provide' for her
some day and after she had taken up
her residence in San Francisco he vis
ited her with the expressed intention
of making her a substantial gift.
He drew up an order on the French
Bank and told her to make it read for
whatever amount she chose. After
some deliberation she decided that
$4500 was sufficient and transferred
that amount to her own account. In
spite of Gasquet's strenuous objections
she made out a note for the sum men
tioned and deposited It to his credit
In another bank. Subsequently she
borrowed $500 more from him and
gave him 'another note. \
, After Gasquet's death his widow at
tempted to collect the amount of the
two notes, but Mrs. Pechin had had a.
change of heart and asserted that the
money was a gift. In this she was
corroborated by a Mr. Carrou. The
lower court decided that. Gasquet' had
given the money to the teacher a.nd
the Supreme Court sustains that Judg
ment.

Visalia Commandery will make a like
numerical showing. Naval v Com
mandery of -Vallejp will have a unique
exhibit In Lyric Hall. The Knights of
Humboldt County will also give the vis
itors a chance to see what their part of

The Knights Templar executive com
mittee proposes not only to entertain
the many visitors who are coming to
San Francisco during the conclave
week next September, but they pro
pose to establish large stands In differ
ent parts of the city, where they will
exhibit many of the products of Cali
fornia, so that the strangers may have
an opportunity to see something of the
possibilities of the Golden State. A
part of the Mechanics' Pavilion ] has
been secured, and*1h addition Native
Sons'. Hall, Lyric Hall" and other halls
have been engaged in which to make
displays of fruits, flowers, minerals
and Â¦ other products.
The commanderies in all parts of the
State are enthusiastic In this matter
and .will contribute to the exhibits.
Not only willthey do that, but they
will come to the city in large num
bers'in order to extend the hand of
fraternity to the visitors. The Indica
tions are that the welcome that is to
be extended to the visitors will sur
pass .that given to the Knights when
the triennial conclave was held here
twenty years ago. . v -
"It was an accident," said the wound
ed jnan, who was begging, for relief
from his pain. VI was cleaning my
gun and It went off accidentally. I did
not shoot myself."
At the Receiving Hospital it was
found that the bullet had entered Just
above the heart and passed through the
body,, penetrating the .left lung and
lodging near the spinal column. The
bullet was extracted, but the condition
of â¢ the injured ' man is critical. His
friends desired .that he be removed, but
this was "deemed inadvisable.
WAS DESPONDENT.
The only reason that could' possibly
be assigned for an attempt at suicide
Is despondency due to 111 health. Wolf
ram" has long been suffering from ma
laria, and It was .his custom to â¢ spend
a portion of' -each- year in >this city for
the relief gained by change of climate.
He came here a few.: days, ago and was
the guest of his uncle and J partner, J."
Goldman. He' started out Friday morn
ing, ostensibly to â¢ make â¢ a trip to the
Cliff House, # but did not return.
In the 'room- at-the-Vendome besides
his clothing ,were:found bottles of med
icine for malarial. trouble. The injured
map's watch. Jewelry, . money, and,
checks were Intact. It* was for a time
thought that Wolf ram was ja victim of
foul play," as when asked how he came
by the Injury to his- head he replied:
"Some one hit me." But. thejjottom of
the bureau' near the door.r.where he
fell, is marred and on It can,be found
clotted blood: and a bunch .of. hair.
These would account for. the Injury to

In a room :in the. Vendome Hotel, 1104-

wound In N the i left breast];- Although the
man claims the injury; was. accidental,
circumstances point strongly to an .at
tempt at suicide, despondency*. due, to
ill health being aslgned.aa the motive.
Wolfram ; visited the Vendome ; at
about 9 o'clock Friday^night and asked
for a room.* The clerk in, charge; re
quested him to register, but this he de
clined to do, saying it made no matter
what his name was. ; He .was then as
signed to Â¦ room 20, which . has double
doore' of ground glass.
At about 8 o'clock yesterday morning
Clarence MclnVyre, proprietor of the
house, heard a commotion in the room,
and on investigation saw reflected
against the ground glass of the door the
shadow of, a man inside evidently try
ing to open the Moor. Mclntyre opened
the door with a pass key and on ente'r
lng found Wolfram lying .on the floor.
There was a gash in the back of his
head and his . left breast was powder,
burned and blood-soaked. Mclntyre at
once called Dr. A. K. Happersberger,
who has an office in the same building.
When Mclntyre and the physician re
turned'to the Foom Wolfram was again
In bed. Blood was . oozing from the
wound-above the heart and also from
the scalp wound. After a hasty exam
ination Dr. - Happersberger- called : for
the ambulance from the Emergency
Hospital, as he did not deem it advis
able to probe for the bullet in the room.
While awaiting the arrival of the am
bulance he asked Wolfram how he had
met his injuries.

â¢Suddenly the brave hoseman's head
appeared at a window adjoining the
room in which little Laurie was Impris
oned. It was the work of a moment
for the athletic fireman to swing him
self to the window of the locked room,
and in another moment a hoarse cry
from the crowd greeted him as he re
appeared with a squirming burden
wrapped securely, in his oilskin coat.
"A ladder,, quick,'.' yelled Battalion
Chief Maxwell, and quickly as men
that know how could dp it the slanting
bridge was raised until It rested on the
window slllr Streams of water kept the
flames clear of the ladder as Engelke
climbed â¢ down with, his burden. . When
he reached the ground he shook Laurie
out of his oilskin wraD and carried, him
to the woman who had screamed. The

Taking a glance to "locate the room,
Engelke burst In the hall door and
dashed up the blazing stairway. Into
the hall, < where the heat was terrific
and the danger of death imminent, fol
lowed Company 28 with a streaming
hose. Here these brave men took their
stand and held In check the flames
that reached for Engelke. They held
their ground in the awful heat amid
flying firebrands until two streams were
brought into play from the rear.
'Meanwhile Engelke mounted to the
third story. He found the room, but
flames already were licking at the
locked door, and he feared to break it
down lest the draught should draw
Into the room those blazing tongues
and render vain his errand.
To those on the street Engelke had
gone to his death. Flames were In pos
session of the trail over which he had
passed, and all around the little room
the furnace was roaring with gaining
ferocity.

She pointed out the window of the
room. Flames were leaping above, be
low and all around'
"There's a child in there," somebody
told a fireman.
"There's a child in that room," roared
Maxwell, the battalion chief.
Engine Company 28 heard and start
ed for the room. There is probably not
a man in that company who would
have hesitated to do what .Engelke
did, but Engelke gave none of them a
chance.
CHILD LOCKED IN ROOM.
Suddenly the air was rent by the
screams of a woman. She was a resi
dent of the tenement and had remem
bered that Mrs. Massa, another lodger,
was in the habit of leaving her three
year-old boy, Laurie, locked up in her
room on the third floor. Mrs. Massa's
poverty compels her to work and pre
vents her hiring some one to care for
her offspring. Laurie was locked in the
room yesterday when the flames start
ed to swallow the tenement, and it was
the thought of the helpless baby's
plight that caused the woman to
scream.
Hoseman August Engelke of Fire En
gine Company 28 played the star role
yesterday in the thrilling rescue of a
three-year-old child locked in 4 a third
story room of a blazing tenement.
Brave as was the plucky hoseman's
deed, it was successful only because of
the splendid discipline and fearlessness
of his fellow firemen, who followed En

the blazing heat played streams of

The fire occurred shortly after 9
o'clock a. m. in a four-story frame

It was evident from the start that the
property was doomed. The occupants

supposed to have left the building. The
firemen were devoting their efforts to
keeping the blaze within the narrowest

Whiie she was in the kitchen of her
home with her two children and a
woman friend on Friday night William
C. Duncan called. He went to the rear
door, which was locked; and demanded
entrance, which was refused. He broke
the glass In the door and obtained an
entrance. It is alleged that he attacked
his sister-in-law, threw her down and
dragged her outside. Then he ordered
the children and Mrs. Duncan's friend
out of the house. AVhen the woman re
monstrated with him he said he had in
structions from his brother, to eject his
sister-in-law. Mrs. Duncan and her two
childre'h went to the home of her friend.
Yesterday afternoon Attorney Short
rldge called with Mrs. Duncan upon
Police Judge Fritz and swore to a war
rant for the arrest of her brother-in
law on a charge of battery. Duncan
was arrested by Detectives Silvey^and
Bailey. He was released on $300 cash
bail. The husband was connected with
duffs grocery, on Eighth street.
On Friday Judge Seawell issued an
order at the request of Attorney Short
ridge restraining Duncan from drawing
moneys which were on deposit with the
San Francisco Savings Union in the
names of himself and wife. -Duncan
paid no attention to the restraining or
der, and on Friday afternoon drew the
money, amounting to over $3400. and
disappeared, leaving his wife and two
young children penniless.
Attorney Shortrldge was notified of
the withdrawal of the money late Fri
day- afternoon and made every effort
to locate Duncan, but. failed. He sub
sequently discovered that Duncan had
left the city on the evening train. He
advised Mrs. Duncan to go to her home
at 1701 Page street and patiently await
results.
Following the application for a di
vorce by Mrs. Benjamin B. Duncan
from her husband made before Judge
Seawell last Thursday, Attorney Sam
uel M. Shortrldge, who represents Mrs.
Duncan, will take steps to have the
husband punished for contempt of
court, and his brother, William C. Dun
can, punished for battery upon Mr*.
Duncan.

The fact Is recalled that McCabe and
Caminetti had to borrow money to buy
postage stamps, and are therefore not
responsible for the deficit.
Surely a big fight is impending. The
chieftains have on their war bonnets
and both factions are determined to
fight to the .finish. Active work In the
direction of securing proxies Is In prog,
ress. Each faction Is confident of suc
cess, but neutral observers of the pres
ent mix-up and of past controversies in
the Democratic party cannot see how
McNab can lose.
When the fight was on in Santa Cruz
The Call directed attention to the fact
that . Gavin McNab in his support of
Gould for chairman was battling for
the control of the State organization.
The. question of Instruction or no'in
struction was not paramount. It Is clear
now that the success of Jeter would
have dethroned McNab. It is further
obvious that Gould has made good by
appointing the men whose names were
written on Gavin McNab's slate.
The question is now asked: "Will
Herrin and McCaffrey get Into the fight
to down McNab?"
In the Hearst camp* no sympathy is
expressed for the defeated Democratic
nominee for Governor. It Is asserted
that Lane conducted a "hogging" cam
paign, and that money collected for
the State committee never reached the
organization, but was expended purely
in the interest of the head of the ticket.
COMPELLED TO BORROW.
The followers of Hearst express sur
prise that \3ould did not appoint either
William T. Jeter or Barney Murphy a
member at large. . In fact, astonishment
Is expressed over the appointment of so
many of the conspicuous opponents of
Hearst in the Santa Cruz convention.
It ; is t quite ; well umjerstqfodi^hat; the
McNab forces nextTSatur day\ will line
up in support of ; - William J. McGee of
San Francisco for chairman of. the
State committee. The Hearst forces,
under the leadership of _ M. F. Tarpey,
will rally to the support of M. F. Coch
rane of San Rafael. Opposition to Al
McCabe for secretary of the committee
has developed. It Is reported that Mc-
Cabe and A. Caminetti neglected the
fight of Franklin K. Lane in the last
gubernatorial campaign, and at the
same time- allowed the debt of the com
mittee to grow until it reached the fig
ure of $7000. The McNab foras insist
that a new secretary shall be J
The Hearst men have decided to fight
Gavin McNab for the mastery of the
Democratic Slate organization. The
first battle of the new campaign will
take'piace at the California Hotel next
Saturday afternoon. It Is the Judgment
of politicians generally that McNab,
who is in possession of the works, is so
strongly intrenched that he cannot be
dislodged. Moreover he received yes
terday material reinforcements from
Frank H." Gould, chairman of the late
Democratic convention at Santa Cruz.
Events forced Gould* to name twenty
five members at large of the Democrat
ic State Committee sooner than he ex
pected. Of the number appointed twen
ty-three are out-and-out supporters of
McNab. Following is a list of the men
appointed by Gould:

AXGEXS MAKE A FAST FINISH.
After one of the closest practice
matches seen on the California Club
<?burts in many months, Frank S.
Mitchell and Joseph S. Tobln yester
day defeated Dr. Hill and Dr. Hardy.
The contest was a remarkable one, for
at no time was either team more than
two games ahead and at all stages
each team had an equal chance of
winning.
It is a rare occasion on the tennis
courts when two sets will require
forty-eight games to settle the ques
tion of supremacy. Ordinarily this
number, of games would constitute at
least four sets. The first set started
with each team winning its service
until finally Tobin and Mitchell man
aged to land an odd game, winning by
an 8-6 score. The second set was much
closer than the first. On several oc
casions each -side required but one
point to win. Mitchell and Tobln
finally won out by a score of 16-14.
William Collier made his reappear
ance on the courts after an absence of
many months. His long rest seems to
have done him good, for he easily dis
posed of Herbert Long.

CHICAGO. June 11.â Moharib, John
W. Schoor's American Derby candi
date,' grandly ridden by Aubuchon, won
the M. Lewis Clark stakes at Harlem
to-day in a hard drive by a neck from
H. T. Griffin's Ascot Derby winner Bill
Curtis. M. S. Tichenor & Co.'s Flo
Bob was third by a head. MohaVlb was
at 18 to 5 in the betting, with English
Lad the public favorite at 6 to 5. Bill
Curtis was at 40 to 1. The race was
begun under most unfortunate circum
stances, as English "Lad and Moharib
were all but left at the post.
One of the biggest crowds of the year
visited the course and a tremendous
groan went up when the barrier was
released and it was seen the favorites
were left at the post. Nothing daunted,
Aubuchon, on Moharib, and Nlcol, on
English Lad, set sail for the leaders
and, rounding the turn into the back
stretch, were close upon the heels of
the bunch. Prince Silverwings led for
a Quarter of a mile when Memories
took up the runing.
Meanwhile English Lad and Moharib
were improving their positions. Eng
lish Lad went up on the inside. Au
buchon, with better Judgment, chose
the outside.' This bit of dexterity Is
what won the race for Moharib, as the
Schorr colt had clear Balling all the
way. Entering' the stretch _ on even
terms with the leaders he came on
home like a real Derby horse and won
In the gamest fashion possible. Bill
Curtis ran In much Improved form and,
dashing out of the bunch at the head
of the stretch, gained ground . rapidly
and finally landed the place honors In a
fierce drive with Flo Bob. The stake
was worth $2925 to the winner.
Bondage captured the one and an
eighth mile handicap, the second fea
ture on the card, defeating Bragg by a
fair margin. Bondage by his victory
In the Harlem National a short time
ago was 1 installed as favorite and
proved to be the class of the field.
Lord Badge was third. It was an
nounced to-day that beginning Mon
day S. C. Hildreth will have first call
on the services of Jockey Aubuchon.

Mr. Knell was batted and buffeted
about yesterday afternoon at Recrea
tion Park like a rag baby. Mr. Schmidt
was wild and uncertain, and sometimes
he got his, too, so between both calami
ties the admirers of each â¢ team were
constantly troubled, with the Jimmies
from the call of "play ball." Oakland
finally got In a few extra bard raps and
won. Score, 7 to 6.
It was a choppy old game of ball all
the way through, with both teams
playing for fair and doing all they
knew how to make a few runs. Oak
land landed on Knell once or better In
every round but the laat, when they
seemed to take pity on the old fellow
and let him escape easily.
The main event was the . agonizing
slowness of Mr. Knell In' the box. He
was something; awful, and therefore
the game went â¢ along for two whole
hours. He waa never done rubbing the
ball with the palm of his band or mak
ing some kind of a motion that might
tend to delay the game. The bleachers
got riled at him, but even the threats
of these warlike beings did not deter
the pitcher.
San Francisco made a brave start in
the first round, when bases on balls to
Miller and Meany, an error by DeVe
reauz' and a hit by Irwln chased two
in. Oakland created a deadlock In the
same round. Francks and Schlafley
singled and advanced on an out. Deve
reaux had the timely boy concealed In
his club and then they both came home.
It went along till the third, when
Oakland amassed one more on a pair
of timely blngles. San Francisco got
another In round five, when they found
Schmiddy safely twice. Jimmy Byrnes
practically tied It up In Oakland's half
of the fifth. "With Devereaux and
Moskiman on third and second, Jimmy
shot a pretty double over the third
sack and brought 'em both to the pan:
San Francisco filled the bags in the
sixth, and with two gone Cy Townsend
got one through Streib, and another
tally was sounded for Uncle. The real
big bunch of explosives was touched
off by Oakland during the progress of
the seventh spasm, when three timely
bangs and Miller's error sent in two
tallies.

STANDING* OF THE CX.UBS.
ST. LOUIS, June 11.â Leland Stanford
Junior* University "was defeated by the
University of Indiana, at the Olympian
championships of Western colleges by
'a score of 32 to 27 points. Purdue. Uni
versity of. Indiana, was third with 24
points. The Calif oraians put up the
worst exhibition of competition seen In
the Middle West in many days. Instead
of faithfully training during the week
they neglected Â¦ their- work, so It is
claimed, and to-day paid for this al
leged neglect by losing, the meet.
The biggest surprise sprung in West
ern athletics in many years .was the
defeat of Norman E. Dole of Stanford
In the pole vault. Stanford had been
picked to win, as It seemed a foregone
conclusion that the pole vault belonged
to â¢ Dole. The latter appeared on the
field confident, but was unable to clear
the bar at eleven feet, and failed to
even get third place. The event was
won by Samseo, Indiana, with a vault
of 11 feet 9 inches, equaling the West
ern collegiate record. Glover of Purdue
and Durland of Illinois tied at 11 feet.
Glover then cleared 11 feet 6 Inches -and
won second place.
In the 440-yard dash, with second
place assured, twenty yards from the
tape Dunn of Stanford stopped in the
race and because he could not win Quit,
when the three points that would have
gone for second would have pulled his
team out of second place.
' Bell of the University of California
team was 1 the best performer, winning
both the high and the broad Jumps.
Hyde took the shotput easily. Dole won
second place In the high jump. Lana
gan was defeated In the high hurdles
by Sledler of Indiana, who broke the
world's record, topping the timbers In
15 seconds flat. In the 220-yard low
hurdles Lanagan turned the tables,
winning the furlong hurdles In the fast
time of 24 4-5, beating . Sledler two
yards. Captain Holman showed up well
In the SSO-yard dash, winning second
place, the event going to Schultz of
Missouri University In the fast time of
2:00 1-5. The .University of Colorado
showed up well, Klnsberry of that
school winning the 440-yard dash In
49 3-5 secondsâ a new Western college
record. Redman of Illinois University
wori the discus . throw and afterward
gave an exhibition, in which he broke
the world's record, sending the discus
130 feet 6 inches. Martin of Indiana
won both dashes, running the furlong
in 21 4-5. Purdue University with three
entries captured 24 points. Summary:

* jQRAVESBND, June 11.â Thirty thou
sand people were attracted to Graves
end to-day by an extra offering of sev
en races, two . of. ; which were classic
events, known as the Brooklyn Derby,
for three-year-olds, at a mile and -a
half, and the Tremont stakes, for two
year-olds, over the short course.
Both of the favorites In these events
were beaten. In the Tremont particu
larly the favorite, Britisher, looked ln- 
vincible. The bookmakers thought so
and the heavy players were of the same
opinion.' It Is estimated that at least
$200,000 was lost on Britisher alone. The
colt ran an amazing race. He was a
bit slow to begin, but before the field
had run a furlong O'Neill was seen to
take hold of Britisher and restrain
him. The colt appeared full of run
ning. They raced this way to the turn,
and so easily was Britisher going at
this point that his backers put up their
glasses with a satisfied air and said,
"Easy money." When, however, the
field was nearlng the stretch O'Neill
was seen to loosen his wrap and start
riding. Britisher did* not respond. Those
who had counted on an easy victory
were, dumb with amazement when
Merry Lark won from Veto by a
length, Britisher being badly beaten^

Big Show of Multicolored Rats.
A successful rat show was recently
held at Cheltenham, England. There
were sixty . exhibits of black, gold,

Some agricultural journals, comment
ing on it, maintain that the rat has
an economic future and may become
a table dainty, in England, as it is in
China. To many people j the show is
the first correction of the impression
that rats are all alike, whereas the

Philip J- Cunningham, on an as
signed claim from the law firm of
Boyd & Fineld, commenced suit In
the Superior Court yesterday against
the San Francisco Gas and Electric
Company for the recovery of $30,000
alleged to be due for legal services
performed between the years 1890 and
1900. William H. Fifleld of the firm is
dead. It is alleged that the services
were performed, for the defendant
company and its predecessor, the San
Francisco Gas Light Company, in the
examination of titles to real property
and in defending the suit of George
C. Bates and the suit for the partition
of the North Peter Smith tract.

Supervisor Braunhart Is . preparing
to draw the deadly parallel on the
Board, of Works In its claim that the
appropriation of $215,000 is insuf
ficient for the city to do its own street
cleaning during the next fiscal year.
Braunhart resurrected a report made
last year, In which the board figured
that the sum of $207,480 is sufficient
to sweep the. streets. In the face of
that report Braunhart says the board
demands $315,000, or more than
$100,000 In excess of Its estimate made
last year. The estimate was made on
a basis of $2 50 a day as the wages

"It is a brutal struggle to get the

of another woman and bear It off In

toward her sister woman, it Is con

can." â New York Commercial.
That women really enjoy a scrim
mage with each other, when no men

up to their b!ue china reputation for
tenderness. Is beyond doubt. Witness
the bargain rushes when women make

Japanese Novelties.
The literature of Japan has excited^
some jealousy in Paris. Nowhere,
says a sprightly critic, Is fiction so
much written and read as in the land
of the Mikado. Japanese romances
are enormously long and dull. One of
them, entitled "The Story of Eight
Dogs," runs to 116 volumes, and at the
end of all the characters, numbering
fifty, without counting the dogs, are
dead, and the. reader's condition is not
much better. Happily, adds the critic,
this tale has not yet been' translated
into Russian. Evidently he is a feuil
letonist, who wishes he could keep a
story going as long and heap up as
many corpses. But in Justice to Japan
it should be said that the romance in
question is in 106 volumes only, and
that the dogs are Japanese gentlemen,
whose canine character Is allegorical.

whether th3 soldiers were alive or dead,
and 50 kopecks for transmitting mess
ages to' them by magic, r
In order to increase his -clientele he .
periodically circulated reports of san

taken place around Port Arthur, and
declared that local battalions. had been
engaged, though these battalions were
often net within a week's Journey of the
imaginary battlefields.

Sam Berger. the husky Olympic Club

a Journey to the springs might ripen

No serious results can be anticipated
from the lay off whatever. Six weeks
of training have transformed the beefy
looking champion Into a well-chiseled
athlete. His face plainly shows the re
sult of this labor by the firm, hard-set
expression when in repose, and there
was more danger from overdoing than
from neglecting â¢ his training. While
resting on his oars Jeff will indulge
sparingly in food, and a relaxation of
fi ym and road functions for two or even
three days should prove beneficial, and
not harmful.
The puffy, 'angry-looking swelling
had been visibly reduced, and while the
leg did not present its normal appear
ance, the results were encouraflng.
The champion was feeling in exuberant
spirits. Jeff said he would contfnoe to
rest to-day, ' but announced that*- he
would be at work again on Sunday.
Manager Billy Delaney did not quite
approve of this, but entered, no protest.
Unco his inind is made up to do a thing,

The splendid service rendered by
thore who obtained commissions In the
army following the Civil War was
abundant proof of their fitness for
command. The test of war service is
one which cannot be equaled by any
system of examination or marking that
may be devised in a time of peace. The
fact of the qualifications of an officer
ae developed under war conditions is
absolute: the question of probable ef
ficiency has no definite standard. In
addition, forty years of military pro
gress have made the requirements for
the accomplished officer much more ex
acting than ever. Now that there is a
prospect that we may have twelve ap
pointments In the year to the commis
sioned ranks of the navy, so long aa
there may be a shortage of graduated
officers, and with the reduction of the
term in the warrant grade so that the
enlisted man may get to a commission
at some time before his thirties, it
â¢would seem that all had been dons that
need be done toward making the pro
motion easier. What is mainly to be
feared is that under the stimulus of
the need of officers the restriction of
numbers may be removed and a broad
ly framed general provision may make
it possible fur those to secure a com
mission who would not or could not
qualify under the present restrictions.
On the other hand, promotion within
"the limits now set should not be made

tiously adopted, might be found pro

The "late" Henry Jacklln of Indian
apolis is at Seelbach's Hotel. Mr. Jack
lln claims to have acquired a constitu
tional habit of always being late and
that thereby hanps the tale and reason
for his sobriquet of the "late." etc. "To
be late is to be important," said Mr.
Jacklln last night. "Nobody ever con
sidered me until I acquired this valu
able habit. By being late people are
bound to notice you and tney begin to
talk about you. When you are talked
about you are on the high road to great
things."â Louisville Herald.
How Mr. Jocklln Butted In.
As we were going down town the
other forenoon we saw a family and
appendages catching a chicken for din
ner. There was the man, the woman,
the big daughter, the ten-year-old bay,
the baby, the dog and a great hulla
balloo of a racket. The Initial move
was an ear of corn, with which the man
gently and slowly strewed the ground
at his feet. Then there was the pois
ing and the quick grab, which gave no
return but a tail feather or so. And
then the cry: "Run him down!" In
stantly every one was In motion. The
young rooster cut across the garden,
followed by the dog and the man. The
prey darted . through the lath fence;
the cur bumped hia nose against it;
the man changed his course and crash
ed through the gate and into the barn
yard, the baby fell down in the mud
puddle the mother shook her apron and
screamed. Tlie small brother circled
the haystack in pursuit, the big daugh
ter shooed with her every-day hat, the
neighbors gaped out of their windows.
On went the furious race until finally
the panting bird ran his head Into the
haystack to get out of sight and was
gobbled.â Elk Point (S. D.) Leader.
A Family Catch In Dakota.
These rules are recommended as
simple and easy of application. Their
general acceptance would undoubted
ly be appreciated by the average
reader. â Washington Star.
The rules adopted by the board of
geographic names provides that the
vowels shall have the sounds that are
common to the vowels in the lan
guages of Southern Europe. It fol
lows therefore that u has the sound of
oo in boot and that Manchuria is
therefore preferred to Manchoria,
Chefu to Chefoo, Amur to Amoor. It
has been ruled that al has the sound
of 1 in Ice; au the sound of ow In how
(ao â a very frequent combination In
the East, heard In names like Min
danao and N'anRO â is slightly different
from the preceding) ; ei, as in Beirut,
has the sound of the two Italian
vowels, but is frequently slurred, when
it Ab scarcely distinguishable from ey
in the English word they.
In accordance with the rules, c Is
always "soft," having the sound of e.
"Hard" c is represented by k, and It
therefore follows that Korea is the ac
cepted form and not Corea. Other
rules are that ch Is always "soft," as
in church; f Is sounded as in English
and ph should not be used to repre
sent this sound; g is always "hard,"
as in get; h Is always pronounced; j
and k have the English sound; kh
has the sound of the Oriental, gut
tural; gh is another guttural; ng rep
resents in different words different
sounds â two sounds, as in flnger, and
one, as In singer; q should never be
employed for the sound qu. which is
represented by kw, as in Kwantung;
y is always a consonant, as in yard,
and should not be used for the sound
of the vowel i, as It is in very or rely.
The confusion arises from the fact
that these geographic names are writ
ten in their native tongues in charac
ters unlike those we employ. Different
persons translate them Into Roman
characters in different ways. The value
of a set of rules that would reduce the
variations in spelling to a minimum is
apparent.
Henry Gannett, geographer of the
United States Geological Survey, has
recently received numercms letters of
inquiry regarding the proper spelling
of the place names in Korea and Man
churia that have become prominent in
the news columns of the day since the
outbreak of hostilities between Russia
and Japan. The variation In spelling
observed in the usage of different
newspapers and different map makers
is confusing to the common mind. Mr.
Gannett suggests that the matter
would be much simplified !f it were
generally known that a system of
transliteration of such names has been
adopted by most European nations, by
Canada and by this country. This plan
is published in the second report of the
United States board on geographic
names."

the Pronunciation Adopted by
the Government.

Oaklanders surely had a feast of music last
night, for. besides the Rowlands concert, there
was another Interesting musical event at Or
pheus Hall, when the second of the series of
recitals given by pupils of A. T. Stewart and
John Metcalf took place. The. programme was
one of unusual merit and was participated In
by those two very clever young pianists, Mrs.
Robert Hughes and Miss Estelle Drummond.
Miss Helen Lutphen, a very promising violin
ist, and Miss Florence Luke, also, a piano stu
dent.
Several vocal numbers were contributed by
Miss Lullta Wasley, the young mezzo-con
tralto, who will forsake a musical career in
favor of matrimony Her wedding with Frank
McCuen will be one of the Interesting social
events of the near future.

Carolyn Crew has undoubtedly the most
beautiful soprano of any singer In this vicinity
to-day and it Is safe to predict that if she
continues to progress as she has in the last
year or so some future day will find her In
thÂ« ranks of the great,
Nothing could h&vÂ« been prettier or more
artistic than her delightful rendering \$t the
"Chanson Provencale," by Del Agua, and the
"Haymaking," by Needham.
In spite of a cold. Mr. Veaco tilled his place
on the programme most acceptably, his solo
and also the duet with Mr. Rowlands being
heartily encored. Miss Hlbbard and Mrs.
Dexter are both two well known to need any
comment; It is sufficient to say that they were
at their best. Apropos of Mrs. Dexter, ehe
hia received a pleasant tribute- to her mu
slcianly ability from Los Angeles. She has
boen engaged to sing at the first annual musi
cal festival of the Allied Choral Societies of
Southern California, which will be held In the
"City of Angels" from June 20 to July 2.
Mr and Mrs. Rowlands expect to leave for
Europe about the last of July.
The programme as rendered last evening was
as follows:
?OAKLAND. June 11.â It wm a large and
enthusiastic crowd that greeted Clement P.
Rowlands at Maplt Hall last night; in fact
he was given a perfect ovation every time he
appeared. His singing was all that could be
desired, although a little end-of-tbe-season
weariness was evident in the usually vigorous
tones. One of his numbers was a little Welsh
lovt eong. "Mentra Given," which received
the wildest applause and which he was obliged
to repeat.

tables grown by school children in the
course of the study of nature is the
first of its kind to be given in Califor
nia, and the success which has been
achieved in thus Instructing the gram
mar school pupils by practical work re
flects great credit upon Miss Chapman
and her assistants. The experiment of
Introducing nature study into the pub
lic schools was flrst tried in the East.
The results there obtained encouraged
the school, authorities of this city to
adopt the innovation here. After see
ing the exhibit to-day Superintendent
McClymonds said he was thoroughly
satisfied with the showing made by the
children.
The exhibition opened this morning
and continued until 8 o'clock this even
ing. Hundreds of people visited the li
brary to view the work of the children.
The schools represented were the Lin
coln, Lafayette, Tompkina, Garfield,
Durant, Grant, Temeacal, Grove-street
Piedmont, Clawson, Cole, Swett, Pres

OAKLAND, June 11.â Fruits, flowers
and vegetables, the products' of gar
dens planted by the little nature stu
dents of the local grammar schools,
were exhibited to-day in the children's
room of the Carnegie Library. The
showing made was most creditable. All
of the common table vegetables were
represented, with many of the ordinary
flowers that are cultivated in the open
air. Several varieties of berries were
also on exhibition. The exhibit was
under the direction of Miss Bertha
Chapman, the supervisor of nature
study in the public schools, who was
assisted by a number of teachers.
The tables on which the exhibits were
arranged were in charge of committees
of children from the various schools,
and each bunch of flowers or display of
berries or vegetables was tagged with
the name of the youngster from whose
garden it had come. In addition to the
displays of natural products many of
the exhibits were Illustrated with col
ored drawings by the pupils.
The little gardeners took great pride
In showing the results of their work to
the visitors, of whom many were pres
ent during both the day and the even-
Ing.

W. R. Kennedy, who was shot near
Newark as the result of allowing Wil
lard O. Sttwart a midnight interview
with his wife, was brought to the Coun
ty Jail here this afternoon and will
be held as a witness until the prelim
inary examination next Wednesday.
He hus talked freely about the mat
ter since his arrival, and this after
soon swore to the complaint before
the District Attorney charging Stew
art with an assault to murder him.
Kennedy"? wound is healing rapidly,
and he Is now on the high road to re
covery. He had evinced a disposition
not to prosecute Stewart ow ing to the
notoriety be would suffer, but said in
en Interview to-day that Stewart had
given out several misstatements in re
gard to the matter and he was now de
terrr.ined to try to convict him. Not
withstanding his change of heart
Constable Broderlck, who had taken
Kennedy's clothes away from him In
order to keep him from leaving the
county, felt that he would be safer in
jail, and this morning he visited the
Kennedy home and made a prisoner of
him.
Kennedy made his flrst statement of
the affair this afternoon, and said that
it was Jealousy that caused him to
bring bis wife and Stewart together,
as he wished to be assured that his
suspicions were not well founded. In
this connection he said:
"If you loved a woman and you
feared that another mac was sharing
your wife's affections it would keep
rolling itself around in your mind un
til you couldn't rest There were two
of u*. and I wasn't sure Â¦whether my
â¢wife loved me better than she did Stew
art, or I thought ehe didn't know which
of us she liked the best.
"So when I met Stewart unexpect
edly in San Francisco and I got talk
ing it over with him and he denied
that she liked" him, I told him to go
to Newark with me and ask her
â¢whether she liked him better than she
did me. I was to hide so that she could
not see ire. I rapped on the window
and got her to come out and then hid
and left Stewart there, Instead of
talking so that I could hear where I
â¢u-as hiding, he took her away in an
other direction, and then when I ran
after them he fired.
"I wanted to hear my wife say she
did not care for him and that she only
liked me, but he spoiled it alL Per
haps he was afraid to let me hear what
ehe would say. Anyway, my plan mis
carried, and I am worse off now than
1 was before."
Both Stewart and Kennedy are
youns men. neither appearing mom
than 25 years of age, and of quiet bear
ing, and hardly look like men to be
mixed up in such an affair. Edith Ken
nedy, the woman in the case. Is about
the same age.

Joying their stolen honeymoon without

A dispatch from New York says: By
means of the gigantic transmitting
tower he is erecting at Wardencliff,
Long Island, NIchoIa Tesla hopes to
put every newspaper In the world out
of existence and to transmit telegraph
ic messages to the uttermost parts of
the globe.
In an article in the Electrical World
and Engineer Mr. Tesla explains the
system, and adds that "the noble gen
erosity of J. Pierpont Morgan," who
furnished the money when others did
nothing but doubt, enables him to put
the system in operation.
Mr. Tesla says he will magnify the
stationary electric waves in the earth
to such a degree of power that the
globe easily can be girdled.

A good st6ry is told of a domestic in
an East End family who had been a
long time in her situation, and who
"gave ' notice" because she was going
to be married. The girl who was en
gaged to take her place sent word to
her mlstress-to-be that she would not
be able to begin her duties for at least
a fortnight after the date on which
her predecessor was to be married. The
maid was asked by her mistress wheth
er she would agree to postpone the
date of the wedding, but she declined
to do so, bearing in mind the old adage,
"Change the date, change the fate."
She said, however, that she didn't
mind getting married and coming back
for a time, until the other girl could
assume her duties, and this was finally
agreed upon, as the young man offered
no objection. Half an hour after the
ceremony the girl was performing her
customary duties and her mistress said
to her, smiling:
"And I suppose your husband has
gone back to his work, too, Matilda."
"Oh, no, indeed, ma'am," replied the
girl. "He's bane gone on his honey
moon."â Duluth News-Tribune.
District Attorney John C. Bell has
recently returned from the south, and
looks as brown and healthy as he did
in his palmiest days as a college ath

ways collects a budget of * good
stories, and he is a master of the art
of telling them. Here is one of the new
ones which has amused the District
Attorney and his friends greatly:
An old white-headed negro named
Moses was one day walking along the
road, when he saw young Sam sitting
on the fence, grumbling to himself and
looking very sullen.
"Wah's de mattah wid you, Sam?"
asked the old darky. "Whah f oh all dis
yere blackness?'
"Oh, it's all dat Mars Fairfax." was
the reply. "Ah can't git along wid him

"Look a-hyuh, Sam, why doan you
'cert yuh 'dependence once in a wile?
Dat's de way ter do. When Mars Fair
fax cusses yuh, yuh cuss him back."
â¢A few days later old Moses came
along the road once more, and saw
young Sam sitting on the fence again,
this time with his face all disfigured,
as if he had been in a fight and
"bruised up" generally.
"What's de trubble now?" asked the
old man. " 'Pears like yuh done gone
and ran inter one of dem steam en
gines."
' "Foh de lan's cake, man," said old
Mose, rolling his eyes, "yuh didn't let
him hyear yuh, did yuh?"âPhiladel

"If* all yuh fault, Uncle Mose. Ah

"After the luncheon I thought over
the matter and puzzled my mind to
know why a teal duck could be eaten
on Friday when a mallard would be
under the ban of the church. For
that reason I asked a good friend of
mine who is a pastor of one. of the
churches. He informed me that a teal
duck was not flesh any more than a
trout or a minnow. The teal is the
same as a turtle or an egg, neither
flesh nor fish. And there is good rea
son for this, too, when you come to
analyze the peculiar habits and tastes
of the teal. This little duck will not
feed on anything but fish, or little
things of that sort that live In water.
That accounts for the teal having such
a strong fish taste. He lives on min
nows and small fish altogether. On
the other hand the mallard eats grain,
such as wild rice, corn, wild grasses
or the seeds thereof, besides feeding.
as does the teal, on minnows and small
fish. But simply by the mixing of the
diet the mallard is under the ban so
far as adorning, the Friday dinner
table of an orthodox Catholic goes."
Baltimore American.
"Did you know that a teal duck i3
not flesh?" lnauired one of a party
of gentlemen who were discussing the
high price of fish since the Lenten
season set in. "It's a fact. The teal
duck is not flesh, even if it is a fowl.
It is the same as a winged and
feathered fish, and any good Catholic
can safely eat one for fish during the
Lenten season or on any Friday. I
did not know this was a fact until a
few days ago, when I happened to be
a guest at a luncheon whereat sat
one of the great dignitaries of the
Catholic church. It was on a Friday
and I was astounded when a teal
duck was served at every plate. But
I knew that there were good Catholics
there and that one of the arms of
the church government. In fact, sat at
the same table and had a duck before
him. so I . .Jd nothing just at the time.

the opening, although an easier tpne In for
eign markets had some effect here. Initial
quotations In July were off %c to VÂ£6Hc at

quite bearish. A potent factor In the situa
tion was a crop report of the Northern Pacific
Railroad Company, which stated that shipping
wheat Is fully as advanced now as at the
corresponding time last year. The fact that
harvesting is well under way also seemed to
attract traders to the bear side.

WHEATâ The week closed without much

brilliant holders are getting alarmed and are
getting rid of their long stuff. The cash grain
remains quiet and unchanged.
The Chicago letter of Mitchell. Mulcahy &
Co. said!, "The Government report Is about as
expected and. Inasmuch as It shows an Im
provement'over 0 month ago. is bearish. The
statisticians figure the crop anywhere from
25.tiOU.yOO bushels below last year to 20.000.WO
bushels in excess, depending on their estimate
of the par. yield. Cables are dull and weather
conditions continue fine for the crop. Cash
situation Is wholly unencouraglng and prices
continue to crumble all along the line. In view
of several days* break there was rather better
buying of the deferred futures, but the whole
market is tame and can hardly be called strong.
The visible supply on Monday will show some
decrease, though probably not as much as last
year. World's bhipments are estimated at
io.000.0u0 bushel*. Bullish confidence based
on cash situation Is gradually being dissipated
by the near approach of new crop. Demand of
every character Is from hand to mouth. We
are still of the view that Wheat may be sold
on tttfe hard spots."

New Potatoes continued to arrive freely from
thÂ« river and the market had an easy tone, as
local trade was quiet and there waa nothing
do!nÂ«r ,n the shipping line. Prices were un
changed, however, and occasional sales of extra
fancy stock were still reported at a slight
advance over the maximum quotation. Old
Potatoes were dull in sympathy with new and
prices were largely nominal. New Onions were
steady, but Australians were quoted lower.
Trade in miscellaneous vegetables was active
as usual on Saturday, but the market was lib
erally supplied and prices of mcÂ«t descriptions
were lower. Receipts of Tomatoes from Los
Angeles were nearly 1000 packages and a car
load of Mexican waa marketed. Prices of thosÂ«
descriptions ranged lower, but the Mississippi
article continued to sell off well at the pre
viously quoted ratrÂ«. Peas and Asparagus
ruled firm, with the eanners still buying the
latter at 4%i&5c per pound. Green Peppers
from Stockton were offering again and sold at

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JUNE 12, 1904.
During Â¦ the last hour the market showed
some resistance to the declining tendency.
Demand for September wheat was of suffi
cient volume to cause a considerable advance
in that delivery. In sympathy with the firm
ness of September the July option made a
partial recovery. After Belling off to feSVic,
I July closed at 6S3(c.
} A number of bearish influences, the mott
potent of which I were the weakness of wheat
and a large Increase In the movement, tended
to create a weak undertone In corn. The
' market closed at about the lowest point of
I the -day. July opened %c to "Jo lower at
I 4S?ic to iSTic aad closed at 48 1 .4Â®4S%c.

For a reliable and intelligent clairvoyant
reading go to LIVINGSTONE. 428 Eddy st.
He asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
He does not mention all the Ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts In your case. Let PROFESSOR
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suggest the remedy.
He la as conspicuous for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he Is for his original ex-

Would It not be a relief to know how you
will succeed, to be relieved of the matters that
are. troubling you and of the schemes of your
enemies, that you may meet with better success?
A test reading Is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full Ufa reading for $1. A test
is of little value; when the mind is troubled
yon need more substantial aid and advice.

"Possibly," It was gently suggested
at this point, "If you give the same at

Shipping Intelligence.
The steamer -Redondo, Captain Krog,
arrived yesterday, 20% days from the
Russian port of Petropavftvski with a
cargo of furs valued at $250,000. The
Redondo 13 under charter to the Kam
chatka Commercial Industrial Com
pany, a Russian fur-trading organiza
tion, for which Roth, Blum & Co. are
agents at this city. This company's
steamer Kotik was seized by the Japa
nese at the opening of hostilities. The
barkentine Behring, another of Its ves
sels, was lost, and as the furs had to
be collected and the various stations
supplied with winter stores ' the Re
dondo was chartered for these pur
poses. She "will make another trip,
bringing back the season's catch of
sealskins. Before the war the Russian
company bought all supplies at Yoko
hama and shipped its furs through
Japanese agents to London.
Baron Nicholas Bruggen, the man
ager at St. Petersburg of the Russian
company, who left here on the Redon
do, was a passenger on the return trip,
as was Captain G. Wilderaann, former
commander of the captured Kotik, who
accompanied the expedition as a pilot.
Victor Vogelman, a Russian mining en
gineer, who is on his way to St. Peters
burg, was also a passenger on the Re
dondo.
The Redondo's voyage from here was
boisterous, in the extreme. She was
fifteen days getting as far as Dutch
Harbor. On the return trip she came
from Dutch Harbor in nine days.

Somewhere upon British soil there Is
a young doctor who has v.ithln the last
few days learned a lesson which should
be Invaluable to him in his future prac
tice. Having: accompanied his betrothed
to a theater, while the house was in
semi-darkness she suddenly complained
of feeling faint. The doctor took some
thing out of his pocket and whispered
to her to keep the "tabloid" In her
mouth, but not to swallow It. She did
as she was told and soon felt all right
again. The tablet, however, showed no
signs of dissolving, and In the end, be
ing curious to discover what the taste
less, indissoluble substance that had
proved so efficacious could be, she
slipped the undiminished substanca
into her glove for future inspection.
When she got home she took it out of
her glove again and examined It. It
was a bone glove button. â London

The man was walking at a moderate
gait, apparently In no great hurry,
when he reached the corner. He had
leisure to pause there to look after a
pretty woman. Then he started across
the street. Two wagons, a cable car
and a fire engine were coming and the
man quickened his pace. He could hav*
stopped to let them pass, but he had
no time to spare now. He dodged in
front of the two wagons and found
room to wait for the cable car to pass.
But he couldn't wait; he had suddenly
been deprived of all leisure. He esti
mated speed and distance at a glance,
bolted in front of the car, continued
wildly across in front of the engine and
reached the opposite side of the curb on
the run. He was in desperate haste or
he never would have taken those
chances. Any one could see that. But,
once safely across, he stopped, turned,
stuck his hands in his pockets and
stood watching the fire engine until It
was out of sight. Then he went leis
urely about his business, again having
ample time for all he wanted to do.â

The Siberia, Captain J. Tremalne
Smith In command, carried a large
number of passengers and about 7000
tons of cargo. This freight is mostly
for Japan and included 1000 tons of
structural iron, 100,0 tons of flour, 12
carloads of railroad trucks, 75 rail
road cars and 1000 tons of steel rails.
Stevedores worked night and day
loading the liner Siberia and yester
day at 1 o'clock she was ready for
sea. Passengers were aboard, freight
was under hatches or securely lashed
on deck, mail was safely stowed away,
but the liner did not leave the wharf
for nearly an hour after schedule time
owing to the late arrival of the "of
fice mail."

"I was at a dinner in London last
sprins," said the Chicago lawyer, "and
almost directly opposite me aat a
countrywoman of mine from Ken
tucky. One stout, red-faced English
woman In the party persisted in bait-
Ins the Kentuckian till I laoked to see
her lose her temper long before she
did. The English woman talked about
America and the Americans as If the
Kentucky woman had invented the
country and was responsible for every
thing 1 from Tammany to Pullman cars.
Nothing American escaped her cen
sure, and at length she began on the
race question in a way that isn't heard
at American dinner parties. She went
on and on, and the Kentuckian began
to look dangerous. At last the Engiish
woman said:
" 'But you can't deny that you actu
ally burn nlgger* in the States.*
"The Kentuckian smiled deliber
ately.
" 'Oh. the reports of that are greatly
exaggerated.' she said. 'The practice
isn't general. "VVe only do it in parts
of the country where coal is too ex
pensive to use.*
"And the English woman didn't
speak another word for nearly five
minutes." â Washington Post.

, San Bernardino and Santa Barbara
counties have entered the lists against
(he States that are supposed to hold
the "apple supremacy and are fully on
sn equal footing with the latter in the
exhibits of that fruit It was sup
posed that California would have to
give place, when apples are in question,
and that those displayed by Missouri.
Idaho and Arkansas could not be sur
passed or equaled. Special displays
have been made by San Bernardino and
Santa * Barbara that equal anything
shown by States known as the homes
of 'the apple. Their sixe, color and
flavor are comparable with those of
any part of the Union.
The mining display is ready at last.
State Mineralogist Aubury has been
compelled to reduce the sizes of signs
that private exhibitors in the space
wanted to nut on their displays. The
borax people are still to be reckoned
with. They have not only made ex
hibits In both California and Nevada
epaces. but 'in the former they have
erected what Is supposed to be an
exact representation of a package of
their borax. It is a cheap, ugly affair,
about Jwelve feet high and six feet
square and looks like a section of a
vacant lot advertising fence. Califor
nlans have severely criticized It It
gives a very cheap â¢ effect to what
would otherwise be a very pretty dis
play. Â¦
Mr. and Mrs. George C. Roeding of
Fresno are to return to their home In
Fresno this week. They have made
themselves very popular here and their
departure will be regretted. Mrs. Roed
ing has graciously devoted much of her
time to entertaining visitors at the
California building. something she
knows well how to .do.
Dr. John Gallagher of San Francisco
dropped into St Louis from Chicago
during the week and Is now on his way
home by way of New Orleans.
Cork from trees grown in Fresno
County is exhibited in the Government
building at the exposition. It is a very
good quality and cork brings a very
good price, but unfortunately for the
industry in California It takes about
fifteen years for the trees to produce a
commercial crop. The cork forests that
have been doing business at the old
Etand In Spain for centuries are prob
ably not in immediate danger of being
rendered valueless by Fresno. Many
a laurel has been wrested from the old
world nation by the California county,
lliowever, and the latter can get along
for* the present without growing cork.
. Mendoclno County has sent 5000 ar
tistic booklets, showing her beauties
and resources, and they are being dis
tributed at the California building. The
beautiful display of redwood/burls in
the Forestry building is made -by Men
docino. but she has no individual dis
play.
* "<â¢ " CALIFORNIA APPLES.
On the World's Fair map is a square,
up where the camping forest stands,
marked "Wild Animals or California."
Nothing seems to be doing there and
neither the State Commissioners nor
any other Callfornlans here know what
this space Is reserved for. Aubury has
a dim suspicion that It is the ground
intended for the natives. He is going
to investigate and If he finds this to be
true he will buy all the maps and burn
them.
Lewis F. Aubury. State Mineralogist,
who has charge of affairs for the Na
tive Sons at this end. is waiting for
credentials to be forwarded him by the
grand president. Ab soon as he re
ceives them he will see the fair officials
relative to the proposed excursion of
the parlors. He thinks the encampment
project feasible and believes, the offi
cials will help it along, as the visit of
these young men to the region from
which the fathers of many -of them
began the oxtraln journey to the Pa
cific In pioneer days will have a ro
mantic significance. Aubury will gath
er about him as advisersrthe other Na
tive Sons in the California colony here,
of which there are several.

CAIAj BUREAU, WORLD'S FAIR.
ST. LOUIS, June 11.â Stories are be
ginning to float about the World's Fair
grounds of 6000 native born Califor
nlani who are coming to the fair In
a body some time in the fall and who
Trill camp under the maples up in one
corner of the grounds. There is much
inquiry about this rumored coming of
the natlvÂ« Callfornlans and much cur-
Iflslty on the part of foreigners and
"way down Easters." who have never
visited the coast There Is argument
as to whether these natives are dark
as the Maccabebes and whether they
affect the costume of the Igorrote and
pugilist or cover themselves with skins.
It being generally known that Cali
fornia has a temperate climate, the
Igorrote theory prevails. Besides the
savants of New Hampshire and Maine,
who have waded clear through the ad
vanced geography and thus gained
enviable reputations for learning In
the Eastern culture belt, explain that
it is the Esquimaux, up about the
north pole.who wear skins other than
their own.
It Is generally conceded that the
California natives do not eat dogs as
do the Igorrotes, so in case the pro
ject of an N. S. G. W. encampment at
the World's Fair carries, the flower of
California's young manhood will not
be charged, as the meek Filipinos have
been, with the crimes committed by the
sly Wienerwurst man.
