enty-five years for the total sum of $25,

the proceedings opened in the finance
committee room, until after 8 o'clock,

When Heywood died, on July 23, ltÂ«l,
Lyons asserts in his statement. Ague*
Maud Heywood was 17 years of age
and the interests in her father's estate
had been consigned to the keeping of
Attorney H. A. â¢ Powell, who had been
her father's adviser for many years. In*
stead of caring for her interests, as
Powell should have done, the attorney
for the. executors. Lyons sets forth In
his' statement. Powell allowed the
young woman to become of age without
taking advantage of her rights. * esti
mated to be worth $50,000. and then
when^she employed Lyons, her present
attorney, Powell set up the claim that
she had lost her rights through her
failure to take advantage of them when
a i minor. Lyons further contends that
the executors took no action in her be
half, although also appointed in the
will as her guardian, and that when
Powell was later asked by Miss Hey
wood why he had neglected her rignta
he became . angry * and accused her of
ungratefulness.
In . connection with these charges
against Powell and. the executors, it
was cited by Lyons in argument that
in ,the .wiir of . the deceased Powell was
referred to as a "friend** and Miss Hey
wood â was requested by her . father, to
rely upon him. It was further contend
ed by Lyons'that the uncles were inter
ested In handling the estate as they did.
â¢ for the will , of the deceased provided
that they should have the entire j estate
should the daughter die withlna speci
fied time. This time . has not ; yet : eat-' .
plred. and while it is. not probable that
the uncles wOl profit by their failure to
enforce - the rights . of. the daughter.! It
is possible that, she will : be â¢ denied a
homestead on the late residence of her
father. v
- " The - case win remain on argument
for a 'day or two. after which, the court
will take it under advisement v for 4MÂ»
cision. .
Mrs. Heywood was in court. Specta
cled and austere, she looked with aston
ishment .upon the mere cirl on the stand
so glibly telling r Â«f,her needs "and hopes 1
and regret* jnfpthe smallness of her in
come of tae,< past. ; But Judge Kerrigan
seemed taPfleok ??a-ixfdly upon her re
quest. Durffig the litigation Miss Hey
wood I has^sho wn unusual balance for
one of her ."years, and It is safe to haz
ard a guess that if her prayer is grant
ed there will be no lavish expenditures
for luxuries simply because they bear
the name and are intended alone for the
rich.
When Mis 3 Heywood left the stand,
her petition for a larger, allowance being
taken under advisement. Attorney Tim
othy J. Lyons presented a statement of
what he would prove if given an oppor
tunity to establish' his contention that
his- client's rights had been ; Inexcusably
neglected by William B. and Walter M.
Heywood. executors of decedent's will,
and their attorneys. Powell & Dow.
Lyons presented his statement and It
was entered on the records, .but the
court sustained an objection to. the of
fer of proof.. Lyons was not permitted
to swear any witnesses.

ask? d was none too great for the proper'
maintenance 1 of a young lady with so
many obligations to meet.
Was she not the mistress now of the
big home where her father used to
dwell at 1410 Hayes street? This home
must be kept up. and to do this was not
a servant required? A; servant would
demand at least $30 a month, and then,
perhaps, another servant would -be
needed. And as a student at the Uni
versity of California, she needed clothes
and books and railroad fare, and she
would like to be nice to her girl friends
at college. And then so much expense
attached to the litigation she was en
gaged in with Mrs. Heywood. the
widow of the dead capitalist, opposing
all she was sure her father wanted her
to have. .
The 51 50 a month she has been given
from the estate ever since her father's
death was not enough, and. .further

Lyons that her interests had been sadly

on his return from the Philippines suffering
from fourteen bolo wounds. He was once

the islands as one of the bravest men
who have fought there.
A jjlanee at ihe soldier would satisfy
an observer that his tale would be of
more than casual interest, for the front
and side of his face are streaked with
bolo cut?. Deep scars are on every part
of his body. His left arm was suspended
in a sllne and his general demeanor
shows that the suffering he has under

A new law enacted by the last Leg
islature, which went Into effect yes
terday, requires the woman as well as
the man desiring to enter the married
state to appear before the County Clerk
to obtain the marriage license. The
law was introduced by Assemblyman
McCartney of Los Angeles. It passed
both houses and was signed by the
Governor on March IS to go Into effect
sixty- days later. Heretofore it was
only necessary for the prospective hus
band to make the affidavits that he and
his intended wife were eligible' to be
joined in the bonds of wedlock.
The news will no doubt cause con
sternation among the fair sex. "Cu

away five - applicants j for marriage li
censes yesterday because the men ap

brides. The applicants were much put
out, , thinking that , Danforth was be
coming too strict. Danforth was put
to some pains to explain that it was not
his fault that the lady in r the case must
come before his scrutinizing gaze."The
trouble is caused entirely by Assembly
man McCartney's little amendment, and
it is up to- him to explain why it was
done.

of the leader of the constabulary with his

and the constabulary left him there, cov
ered with wounds and without food. He
wandered for two days in- a semi-con

found that he had bandaged himself in a

contest of the will of Harry A. L. Floyd
Gopcevic, the young woman who married
a street car conductor of supposedly no
ble origin, is increasing daily. The evi
dence offered Is particularly sensational.
According to the witnesses, the young
woman was mentally unbalanced. Sever
al testified that she assumed the charac
ters of several of Dumas' heroes, and
that whi!e posing as a hero of fiction she
persisted in being given the name of the
hero, refusing to answer to her own.
Among the interesting exhibits in the case
are Feveral letters written in old English
by Mrs. Gopcevic. It is also claimed that
Mrs. Gopcevic dressed as the Dumas he

FRESNO , May 18.â The Cumberland
Presbyterians, in session . here, failed to

missioners present. Sixty-rour had full
delegations. ; . During the - rollcall \u25a0it de
veloped \u25a0 that several seats would be - con
tested.
Jr J." McClelland ,- moved "to appoint a
committee on credentials, of which Judge

bers, with three others, j This was done,
Drs. Templptori;, And , Earkj and ! Elder,; T.

This motion failed/ but it was agreed to
give the committee ampler time to do its
work and , the time for - hearing the ; re
port.was fixed at: the close of the popular

ANY man wishing to be properly dressed this summer, especially on his
vacation, should have an outing suit. Not alone are the suits confined
to outing wear, but many men wear them at business.
They are stylish, dressy, cool and comfortable-^-just suited to their
purpose of keeping you cool when the sun is boosting the thermometer.
The advantages in buying your suit of us are these: If you have a
limiled amount to spend we have the suits at $6.50, $8.00, $10.00 or'
thereabouts. If price is not a matter for consideration, but style is, you will
find every one of oor garments correct in cut, materials and patterns. At .
$10.00, $12.50 or 515.00 you should be able to get just what you want.
The clothes are made by us and sold direct to you just as though you were a re-
tailer buying in quantity. We are manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers, wholesaling i'vÂ«
our clothing to the trade in almost every city of the Union, but retailing it "direct : to -the '':
public in San Francisco in our own stores for about the same prices we ask the dealers in
other towns. .f <\u25a0* V _ ' \u0084 -, , ,-,

;BIXGHAMTON,.N..Y., May IS.â At the
seventy-second annual meeting of the
New York State Association of Congre
gational Churches here the committee on
applied Christianity has made a report of
which a portion is devoted to the dis
cussion of "The Church and Wealth."
The report on this point says:
We believe i the supreme question before the
church to-day is -to teach brotherhood as - the
only - true . basis â¢of business. With . natural
wealth open to the .use. of . all men we. be
lieve industrial combination ' in. the Interest
of J economy \u25a0 would develop' naturally " and I with
Injury to.none.i We, believe the church should
guard aealnwt all such . alliances with institu
tions or individuals of great wealth as 'can
give .color to' the- charge -that the church is
under the domination of the rich, or that her
ministry is silenced regarding business meth
ods oppressive "and. menacing to personal in
dependence. It is our conviction that no gifts
to charitable or religious enterprises can atona
for the wrong done against society by financial
or industrial methods which ignore the natural
law that only the creations of wealth are
worthy to enjoy or distribute.

' John H. Cox died yesterday at his

poisoning, following a wound In the
hand with a rusty nail last October.
He was attended for a while by Dr.
Yon Tiedmann and, was then turned
over to Charles M. Howe, a Christian
Scientist, whose science, however, was
unavailing against rusty nails:
Because her husband, Charles .Ellis
Newell, remained .out .all: of Wednes
day night, Mrs. Elizabeth Newell suf
focated herself with" illuminating gas
in her home at 19. Lily avenue." . New
ell was "arrested yesterday, by. Detective
Bailey and ./is being held for observa
tion. He alleges that he is an Inventor
iipd-,that he;, has, an'^office ,in.tha Emma
BpMckelsilbVlfdlnfi?- V -He 'and ' his - wife
have .been: living for some time in two
rooms on Lily- avenue.
Before his arrest Newell told a very
peculiar story' to Deputy* Coroner Me-
Cormick; He denied: having, had any
quarrel' with* his wife and said that he
left- his :home \u25a0 on V Wednesday ; evening
and rode, in ; the cars , t0. ;.-. the ocean
beach, where he lay down in" the- sand
and fell asleep. and. that when he awoke
the last 'car.fo r the city/ had , gone and
he was obliged to remain* out all night
When he reached home in the morning
he found his wife-dead in-bed and the
room full of gas that had escaped, from
a. small stove, -the; burners of which
were open. He admitted to the -police
that, before he;- left -'home -he and' his
.wife ' had had fai Quarrel concerning ;a
tin .box_ containing 'letters- and, valu
ables that he kept in his office.;
Mrs. Newell- was: 3o' years old..
Detective 'Bailey stated last night that
he was convinced , that - Mrs.*'. Newell com
mitted'; suicide.; and it ' is likely that her
husbancUwill.be released very soon. The
detective verified Newell's statement that
he was at the beach on, the night his wife
met. death, and " corroborated the ", rest | of
his story in almost every particular.

LONTX)N, May 18.â Now that it seems
definitely established that Vice Admiral
Rojestvensky has started on his north
ward journey, there is a great revival
of interest here in. the Far Eastern
campaign. Kwangchau Bay, where pro
vision junks are said to be waiting. for
the Russian fleet, is the most northern
of French possessions on the Chinese
Sea and the last port which Rojestven
sky can set for his final departure^to
meet the Japanese. It has a fine an
chorage and a sheltered channel, where
a large fleet may fide in safety. â¢ '
I Reports still circulate in London to
the effect that the Russian Pacific
fleet's coaling arrangements are ex
tremely inadequate, and have been tjie
main cause of its prolonged stay in
Indo-Chinese waters and that the Ad
miral is finding ever-increasing diiHcul

Special Cable to The Call and New York Her
ald. Copyright, 19C5, by the New Tork Her
ald Publishing Company. \u25a0
Seven fy-six applications to take the
civil service examination for teachers
on June 17 were filed.
The demand drawn on the treasury in
favor of Colonel R. P. Hooe and Charles
A. Berliner in the sum of $100 for extra
services in the compilation of this
year's bids was not approved. Ron
covieri interposed a strenuous protest,
saying' he had not been" consulted
about it.
- A leave of absence was granted to
lliss Margaret J. Mahoney, an assistant
teacher in the Washington Evening
School, from May 22 to November 20,
1905. for the purpose of travel.
The principals of the schools were
jiotified to instruct their janitors to dis
play the flag from the schoolhouses on
Wednesday, June 14, the one hundred
and twenty-eighth anniversary of the
adoption of the Stars and Stripes as
the national emblem of the American
States.
A delegation of high school teachers,
who are heads of departments, ap
pealed to the board to increase their
salaries from $150 to $180 per month.
President Roncovieri stated that. ,it
would be impossible to grant the in
crease, \u25a0which would amount to $7200
J-early, owing- to the inadequacy of the
available funds. He said that he would
not favor an increase unless it would
benefit all the teachers in the depart
ment. The petitioners argued that they
are entiled to more than $10 a month
above the salary received by their as
sistants, who are paid $140 per month.
Roncovieri said it would be unsound
from a business standpoint to raise
salaries before the amount to be re
ceived from the Supervisors is known.
The other members of the board ap
proved the stand taken by Roncovieri
and it is not likely that the requested
increase will be granted.* ' : !
TO DISPLAY THE FLAG.
Director Altmann submitted a new
form of diploma of graduation for the
high schools, which is smaller than
those now in use and will have the
school colors on the seal.
APPEAL TO SUPERVISORS.
The Board of Education ordered, the
report sent to the Supervisors to im
press upon them the need of an appro
priation to make the schools sanitary.
The Board of Education yesterday
adopted a resolution prohibiting x the
use of sL&tes and pencils in the public
schools. The resolution says:
The use of elates and pencils in the public
\u25a0c&ool* Is recocaized by Use medical profes
eioa as iajurious to tbe personal hygiene of
the Individual pupil, especially when said slates
Â»-vj pencils come in contact with the lips,
tongue and oral cavity of tb* pupils; and an
interchange of Â«ii"*Â« and pencils among the
Â«iffierent pupils is constantly taking place by
reason of which the renns of communicable
ciseases axe treqaently tnusfemd from pupil
to posil.
The board adopted the resolution ask
fciâ¬ the Police Department to co-oper
a.tie in. the enforcement of the child la
bor law in order to increase the school
revenue and the average daily attend
ance of pupils. The resolution follows:
: 'OTbereas, Through the rigid enforcement of
the laws relating to truancy and compul
sory education, the average daily attendance
would be creatly increased to the resultant
benefit of this city and county in the eorre
cponfiing amount of moneys to be received from
the State es its share of State school moneys;
therefore be it
j TO IACREASE ATTBVDAJVCE.
Resolved, That this department, not unmind
ful of the co-operation of the Police Depart
ment in the past, earnestly invites and re
quests that UÂ» Honorable the Board of Po
lice Commissioners cause instructions to be
Issued through the proper channels, to each
and every officer, to the effect that every child,
between the aces of eight and fourteen in
clÃiive. who is unable to give satisfactory
evidence of his attendance in some school, be
irV.r n to the schoql situated nearest to the
piace of residence of the child, and then and
there enrolled as a pupil of said school and a
report made to the Board of Education of the
name and address of the child, name of school
and time of enrollment to the end that the ob
jects of the law may be attained and the best
Interests of this city and county subserved.
The Health Board filed a report to
the effect that an inspection of the
plumbing: and sanitary condition of
seventy-three public schools reveals
the fact that forty-eight are in an un
sanitary condition. The majority of
the outhouses are improperly connected
with the sewer, insufficiently ventilated
and improperly flushed. The condi
tions create a menace to the life and
health not only of school children but
to persons living in the vicinity. The
Health Board recommends that all
vault closets, sheet-iron urinals and
wooden Finks be removed and that new
plumbing be installed.

"WASriINGTON. May 18.â Secretary Taft
said .to-day that he had found it . neces

Assistant Secretary of State Loomis. He
added that one of ' the witnesses he had

It has been . admitted, that the fact 3
concerning the $10,000 check from the i s
phalt company to Loomis when the atter
was Minister to Caracas still constitutes
an important phase of the case. Andrews
satisfied President Roosevelt that the
check .was Involved only in Loonxis' de
sire to obtain, American money at a iea
sonable rate of exchange, and thai he ac
cepted therein the services of the asphalt
company. This is Loomis' version of the
case. . . - \u25a0'.
The reports in Caracas were that Presi

compromising evidence, with which he
could prevent American Intervention in

In concluding his long address the pro
festcr said: "The lessons to be learned
from the experience of our sister States
are: That the first step in the direction
of tax reform lies in the separation of
State from local taxation. This clears
the way for the â¢econd step, which is the
adaptation of our taxes jo the peculiar
characteristics which each subject of
taxation has. Then we may aim to se
cure a grtater diversity of taxes so that
taxation shall be more universal and the
burden lighter because carried upon more
shoulders."
SOME DEDUCTIONS.
"The burden of the support of the Gov
ernment falls most unequally upon those
who should bear it- It falls with special
severity uj>on the poor and with the
greatest severity upon the honest. The
present system is highly conducive to po
litical immorality and is a veritable school
ior perjury. It fails altogether to reach
the new forms of property which have
developed during the past fifty years or
to reach ihe new kinds of ability that
should contribute to the public needs.
Per? onal property notoriously ' escapes
taxation, and about 85 per cent of the en
tire burden of maintaining government is
borne by the owners of real estate alone.' ?
George W. Peltier of the California
Btate Bank of Sacramento delivered an
address on "Stability in Ban-ing." | D.
Edward Collins of Oakland read a paper

Collins will appear In Judge La wlor's
court to-day at 10 a. m. to be arraigned.
He eald that he will not be read}*, to plead
at that time and will ask for a continu
ance. He declares he wants his 'trial, to
be held on a valid Indictment so the rec
ord vr'.'t stand for all time. It doesn't
look, though, as If any one but himself
was likely to attack the Indictment
against Mm, so his . alleged reason ' for
fighting It is not accepted by the prose
cution.
GÂ«orge D. Collins yesterday demanded
of District Attorney Byington and the
acting foreman of the Grand 'Jury, E. J.
Bowes, that police surveillance be with
drawn from the house on Sacramento
street, where be has domiciled his wife
and mother-in-law. Ever since the indict
ment of Collins, Detective Tom Gibson,
who has been assigned to assist the
Grand Jury in the case, has had patrol
men in plain clothes constantly on watch
at the residence.
Yesterday J Jacob Meyer, Collins' lieu
tenant, demanded of Byington that the
watch be removed. He appeared before
Judge lAwlor to know if It was-tty the
direction of the court that the police were
watching the residence. When Informed
that It was not. he again protested to By
ington and Bowes. They refused to. ac
cede to the request and Meyer departed
to report to Collins.
Gibson waa Instructed by Byington and
Bowes to continue the surveillance and he
Immediately left the Hall of Justice to
see that vigilance was redoubled. An ap
peal by Collins later in tue day to Chief
Dlnan was without avail. Dinan told the
attorney that Gibson had charge of the
case and would do what was necessary.
The object of the Grand Jury In watching
the house Is to keep In touch . with the
Inmates, one of whom is under indict
ment, another subpenaed and the third
of whom. Collins* bride, may, be sum
moned at any time.
It " has been rumored that the Grand
Jury is considering another indictment
against Collins to replace the one already
filed. Aside from the fact that it Is an
unnecessary proceeding, it is practically
impossible for a corresponding indictment
to be found by the present Grand Jury.
That body is presumed to act upon evi-.
dence submitted In bringing an inaict
reent and a change cannot be made un
less ns-w evidence is secured.

When they agreed to disagree and live
apart, Mr. and Mrs. Harry Vantrin were
apparently content to dwell as strangers
forevermcre. He continued to pursue
his vocation of cook in a restaurant and
she strove for self-maintenance by rent
ing to lodgers the spare rooms of the
home In ' Which he had left her at 323
Jessie street. For a while his relish of
the single harness was so profound that
he cared not what his late running mate
did co long as she abstained from re
minding him of her existence, and she,
too, was apparently happier than she
bad been for a long time prior to her re
lease from conjugal control. Nor was It
she who first intimated dissatisfaction
with the new order of living.
As the novelty gradually wore off
Harry'e freedom from marital responsi
bility he found himself harkening with
cumulative -interest to certain gossip
anent his recent household that persisted
in penetrating the kitchen which was
hi* workshop. These bits of rumor de
picted in a frivolous light the woman who
still bore his name and held his honor
in her keeping. With her alleged light
some goings-on were invariably associat
ed the gallant doings of one Joy Reese,
whom the scandal-spreaders always al
luded to as "the star roomer," and into
the soul of Harry there gradually crept
a most violent hatred of the man.
But why prolong a story to which there
could be but one finale? Suffice it to re
count that at an early hour yesterday
morning Mr. Vantrin burst into the
apartment occupied by Mr. Reese and ut
tered threats to kill, which Mr. Reese
resented by picking up an iron frying
pan and with it striking the invader's
hf-ad so forcefully as to Inflict a wound
b<yji deep and ragged. Mr. Reese then
went out and Informed Patrolman G. K.
Small and two other peace guardians of
what he had done and the officers re
movcl Mr. .Vantrin to the Emergency
Hospital for treatment, afterward book
ing him for battery.
Thus was the tale unfolded to Police
Jucgc Cabaniss, who will hear additional
dctajis next Wednesday.

perform the "shooting up" he was afV
loss to understand, as. he had â¢ never
done such a thing before and certainly
had no desire to do it again.
The Judge pronounced the plea of
exemption well taken, , but fined j Mr.
Brady $5. for disturbing the peace, and
the fine was paid from a bundle of
currency of sufficient bulk, as Bailiff
Conlon remarked, "to choke a cow."

James Maher, bricklayer, was quarrel
ing with his wife in the family home, 6
Enterprise street. Mission district, when
a lighted lamp was upset, and neighbors
who had been watching the conflict
through a window sent in a fire alarm
and notified the Seventeenth street po
lice station that murder was being done.
In response there hastened to the, spot
chemical engine No. 7, in command of
Captain Ewing, and Police Lieutenant
Price afid Patrolman M. V. Burke. They,
found the door of the domicile locked,
but they burst it in, extinguished an | in
cipient blaze and arrested Mr. Maher,'
whose resistance was encouraged by his
better half and their 14-year-old son.
Mr. "Maher informed Judge Mogan that
the domestic incident was started by his
mild reproof of the 14-year-olds refusal to
obey a maternal request, and that there
really was nothing said or done to jus
tify the neighbors in summoning either
The firemen or the . police. . He worked
steadily, did Mr. Maher, and his wife
and five children had no reason to com
plain of his conduct. No, he had not been j
drinking, nor had he demanded money
from his better half and attempted to en
force the demand by visiting upon her
corporal chastisement. If ithe neighbors
had attended to their business, and per
mitted him to attend to his, the court
would not have been bothered by such a
silly affair.
As the wife had entered no complaint,
and as her sister, Mrs. Fitzgerald, ap
peared in court and pronounced Mr.
Maher an of all the domestic
virtues, there was nothing else for the
Judge to do than dismiss the case.

After smiting her husband's head with
an ax Mrs. Annie Wallin sped to the fer
ry station and took a boat for Oakland,
just in- time to elude arrest on a warrant
charging her with assault. She had been
residing across the bay about a month
when her spouse; baptized Olaf, induced
her, by promising to amend his conduct,
to return to his bed and board in j a
Fourth street lodging-house, but ere the
reunion was a week old she regretted it
because of his drunkenness and brutal
ity. When she complained of his be
havior he reminded her of the unserved
warrant and threatened to inform . the
police of her whereabouts. Finally, driven
to desperation, she resolved to again
leave him* but he discovered her inten
tion and at once hastened to the Southern
police station,* where he explained his sit
uation to the desk sergeant, who locked
him up for drunkenness and then effected
the woman's arrest on the two-months
old warrant. Judge Mogan dismissed both
cases, and the. prosecuting attorney hint
ed to Mrs. Wallin that she should employ
a pickax instead of a hatchet when she
again defends herself from onslaught by
her thick-skulled tyrant.
That was how Fred Trlest came to be
arrested and charged with cruelty to
animals. To Judge Mogan he confessed
Â»*e had lied to the liveryman, and he was
pronounced guilty and remanded for sen
tence. He claims to be employed as
driver of a delivery wngon for a â¢ dye
works, and his aJlegation that he dwelt
with his mother at 1227 Sutter street was
proved an untruth, as there is no such

The trial: of Joseph Rebstock,\indict

During the argument Byington said:
"The fact that the faction j represented
by this defendant secured 114 ; votes â¢in
that precinct and the opposing -faction
only two votes'clearly shows. that there
was fraud of the worst kind. Every
act of the defendant that day., should
go before the juryito show the charac

guage to citizens who . came.; to vote
and all the Circumstances i stamp- .the
doings of the defendant as fraudulent.
It was" the worst case of fraud at , an
election ever perpetrated ; in' this city."
The witnesses â¢ lexamined^ yesterday
were George P. Adams, who
identified certain affidavits "and other
documents, and William ; H... Hazel.

that the primary election -was held.

TO CLEAN SHELLSâ H. G-_ I*. LJvef
more, CaL The ; following is" a . method
of cleaning: sea shells: Dark," organic
matter , on the outer Btrrf ace . Is first Te-"
moved by using a thick mixture of
bleaching; powder, one parti to two
parts of water, and soaking the shells
therein." .On removing-, scrub and -wash
the shells. Thick incrustation? of lime
must be ricked off .with a sharp-edged
hammer* or some similar, tool and then
the shells must be dipped Into boiling,
"diluted '': hydrochloric .add. Valuable*
shells may. have face or pearl ;por-*
tlon "covered with shellac Tarnish."
which may ' be removed with alcohol
after the acid bath. For strong, heary
â¢hells use one part add to three parts
water; for delicate ones, one part acid
to ten of water. Dip the shell for a
second only, and examine It. and if tile
effect is not sufficient give it another
dip. ..Hold the shells with wooden, for--
ceps or attach to a '-stick In any way
to serve as a handle. The Important
part Is not to let the acid stay too loos
on the shells. For. local spots the solu
tion should be applied with a brush.

MAYOR JOHNSON of Cleveland has evolved a novel sort of
compromise scheme for the . regulation of street railways.
By means of it he hopes to avoid the worst of the dangers
feared by the opponents of public ownership and, at the same time
obtain the chief advantages that the favorers, of municipal; control
contend for. The plan has the further great excellence' of being
tentative ; it does, not commit the ' advocates of either policy to an
investment from which they could not withdraw' without) big loss of
time and money. If the attempt at improvement does not work well
it will be quickly self-corrective. /
The problem is up for immediate consideration in Cleveland;
for one of the franchises has expired and;. Mayor -Johnson is a fa
vorer of municipal ownership, and a contender "that" fares should be
reduced from five* to three cents. The Glevelandi Electric. Railway,
Company- have offered to meet him half way with- a" four-cent fare
if the city will extend the franchises for twentj J -five years. :Johnson
refuses this, but offers instead his original plan of "compromise." A He
proposes that the - railways be turned over, to 7 a holding company,
a board of trustees, appointed mutually by- the electric company; and
the city. The Holding, company is -to guarantee payment of interest
on the bonds of the electric company^ and HhV: regularly e^pe^ceirt,
on its stock. Out of any surplus it is to make heeded extensions, to
provide a \u25a0 sinking fund for-the . bonds, and to reduce fares. Johnson
believes . that " five months of such management of the rai 1 ways will
prove his contention that three-cent fares are r feasible. If the holding"
company fails to make good the payments of interest and dividends
as promised, that failure will work; forfeiture and the property re
turns-, to ttie control of the electric company.
It is Hoped by this plan to accomplish two very desirable things

THE President has decided that material used in constructing

best and cheapest. The cost of the canal is to be very large
under the most favorable conditions, its construction under
taken as a Government enterprise because the people would .have
it so. Ail Government construction is more costly than private
work For this there seems to be no remedy. It inheres in" the
nature of government. The question is, Shall the building of the
canal be made still more costly by buying the needed material m a
f : It seems to us that the Presidents decision has caused a great
deal of unnecessary and shallow criticism. Republican politicians

ator Carmack of Tennessee believes that he was delivered of wis
dom when he said: "The -triumph of free trade has come qurckly.
H the Government can go to the cheapest market for material^ for
its canal, why should not the Individual be permitted to go there
for the material for his house?"' v
h\ truth, protection is not involved in the matter at all. The
material which the Government needs is of such a nature that com
bination is casilv possible, if the purchase be restricted to this
country. If there were' no tariff at all and the President decided
that all the material should be bought here, and that contracts
therefor should be awarded to the lowest and best bidder, does
ann one imagine that there would be a bona fide competition in the
bidding? If so, he imagines a vain thing. The material to be used
is mostly lumber and metal. The Government must have the maj
tcrial' or abandon the canal. Suppose we had free trade in opera
tion now. and restricted the purchase of the material to the United
States, does Senator Carmack believe that it would be the cheap
est market? If he do, he is more simple-minded than Tennessee
politicians are supposed to be. .
The cost of the canal is estimated, approximately, but is not
certainly known. It is the work of the Government and must be
prosecuted in the midst of difficulties and misunderstandings. One
critic of the President takes a fling at coolie labor, and we observe
that various labor unions have passed resolutions demanding that
only citizens of the United States be employed on the work. If
this were attempted the drain on our population would be felt in
the next census. Citizens of the United States cannot do that work
in that climate. No matter what excellence there may be in the
sanitation of the canal zone, and granting it to be as free of disease
as the snow-capped mountains of California, still white men cannot
toil under that tropical sun "and in that torrid ooze. The lafyor or
ganizations should know this. The disability is not confined to
white Americans, for our temperate zone negroes can no more work
there than white men. This labor question is the first difficulty
which the Government must meet and in which it must be misun
derstood for a time.
The material question is the next problem, and the President
hss solved it. An American isthmian canal was first undertaken
by a corporation, the Nicaragua Canal Company. If that corpor
ation, of which ex-Senator Warner Miller of New York was presi
dent, had transferred its franchise to Panama and were construct
ing *he canal instead of the it would;,j-e ; sort^to, the
markets of the world for its material. If Senator Carmack would
put his statement in this form: "If the Government can go to the
cheapest market for the material for its canal, why should not in
dividuals be allowed to go there for the materials for" their canal?"
the answer would be, that is just what the individuals composing
a corporation to build the canal would have done. Perhaps the
Senator can understand why the Government should not have the
same privilege, or why it is a triumph of free trade in one case or
the other. ' V : ,
The work is external. The Government does what an Ameri
can corporation would do. The Government builds houses in the
United States, a great many of them, and needs more, and it buys
the material iii the same market to which citizens report when they
build houses. So, in the external work of canal building, and the
internal work of house building, the Government does just as its.
citizens do, or would do. Its contracts will be large and the pay
sure. Americans will bid and so will others, and the best bidder,
in actual competition, .will get the award. Millions will be saved
in the cost of construction, and American manufacturers will not
be injured in any legitimate part of their business.
Above all, the construction of the canal will be accelerated by
the President's decision. Time will be the essence of these material
contracts, and being unrestricted the Government can go where the
most time can be gained. The President is accustomed to criticism
and attempted embarrassment. By the time Congress meets it
will be found that he has inflicted no injury upon any economic
policy, has disturbed no legitimate business interest, has violated
no party faith and has given no just excuse to the leaders. of his
part}- for any hasty criticism of his course.
As for Senator Carmack and the remains of the Democratic
party, let them try free trade as a party issue. Let them propose
free hemp, rice, sugar, tobacco, wool and iron, and then take to a
cyclone cellar. while the returns come in from North. Carolina, Ken
tuck}', Alabama, Louisiana and Texas. When they speak of free
trade it is for some one else and not for the producers of, theygreat
staples of the South. In the Democratic Congress of 1894 the
Southern Democrats fought for, protection in ,the Wilson bill and
twisted that measure so out of shape that its authors did not rec
ognize the rickety thing. Free trade is a convenient Democratic
club to use in making discord between the President and his party,
but that is its only use. If made an issue in politics,' half of the
Southern States would vote against "it. Therefore let that subject
be dismissed from the canal discussion. The Government takes the
same privilege that a private corporation would take, and that is all
there is of the matter.' y .
THE CANAL MATERIAL.
HE was tougli. -As. :he leaned
against the lamp post, with his
hands shoved down deep into the
pockets of his trousers, with his dilapi
dated hat pulled. down over his squint-;
ing- eyes, with his lips drawn down into
a leer at the world, he was a striking
example of the bad boy whom circum
stances would 'soon make into a bad
man.; \u25a0 The smaller boys 'who [ wert
seated on the curbstone were .looking
up at him with unconcealed admiration.
To them he was declaiming of his ex
perience?. \u25a0
"Den dere was dat time dat I went
to Montana," ho was Baying. "Memud
der said to me one night. \u25a0\u25a0'Jimmy,- you'd

"And. I said to de old lady, 'Well. I'd
just like to see, myself goln* to any old
school. I'guess nobody won't put me in
one, neither. And I guess you'd better
not try.' " ,
"Did she say ehe'd lick you?" asked
one of the admirers.
The tough-one gave him a glance of
scorn. "Say she'd lick me? Say she'd
lick me?" His voice rose to , a shrill
staccato. Then he laughed jeerlngly.
"I'd just like to see her try to touch
me. But she knows better dan to try.'V
"I wish :my mudder was that scared
of me," . admitted another one of .the
group on the curb.
The one who was unafraid expanded
his cheat 'with hi 9 assumption of .^im
portance. \u25a0 "I've made her that way," he
announced.
'How did you go to Montana?" asked
a seeker for practical information. .
"Walked some and rode some,", was
the boast. "Hitched on a freight car
out as far as "lowa, den I walked nearly
all de way across Nebraska. Den I got
on a" horse dat a fellow had left on de

"Racin' across de plains toward me,'
and 'I killed down' sixteen of them and
I worsted , de seventeenth in a hand-to

"San Francisco has not had a fair in
some time. People have been awaiting
erne, and we propose to give them what
they want. During the months we have
selected for the. venture thousands of
Eastern tourists pass through and spend
pome time in the city, and an opportunity
will be had to show to them the advan
tages of San Francisco and the State.
We will spare no expense in introducing
novelties of all descriptions, and the pa
trons of the exposition will meet withno
disappointment
"While in Portland I met Commission
ers Filcbcr and Wiggins of this State.
Both promised me their hearty support,
and they will give us every assistance in
making our fair a success. We will ar
range to bring a great many of the for
eign and the Eastern exhibits to San
Francisco. In this we will have little dif
ficulty, as 1 understand that most of the
exhibitors are on!y too glad of the chance
of offering a display in â¢California. I will
return to Portland in about two months.
At that time I will have an opportunity
of selecting what I wish and of making
contracts. We have sufficient facilities
here in the city and State to make an
excellent show, and with outside con
tributors the affair should attract atten
tion, both from the standpoint of knowl
edge and amusement.
"In arranging for the exposition we
find we have many advantages, and we
will need to tax the public very little. The
institute has several thousand members,
and ail will lend a hand. Light and trans
portation will cost us little, and we own
the pavilion In which the fair will be
given. The city is growing, and we ex
r>ect much more interest and assistance
than has been devoted to similar ventures
in the past. It will follow the Portland
Exposition, and many of the people inter
ested in that will make their headquar
ters in this city." . /.-. I,
Plans for the fair proposed by the Me
chanics' Institute of this city are taking
definite shape, and tbe exposition is like
ly to excel anything: of its character ever
Erven in California. Rudolph J. Taussig,
president of the institute, has just re
turned from Portland, where he was in
conference with the California commis
sioners to the exposition soon to be held
sx that place. Taussig expects to seenre
na.iv of the Portland exhibits, and with
tbese will offer a display of a high order
dTiring the months of February and
March of next year.
"We are going ahead with this affair,"
said Mr. Taosslg. "and we expect nothing
bat success. Of course, the citizens of
this city should 00-oper&te with us, and
if they do so 1 do not see how we can
faiL It must be understood that the Me
chanics' Institute is not in the business
for profit- It is a public-spirited associa
tion, with the interests of the city, and
the State as well, at heart. An exhibition
of this character' will be productive of
much good "as well as affording amuse
ment and instruction to residents and
visitors.

Many matters of , general " : public - knowl

Among these were the suit ' that was in
stituted to jprotect civif service; the crim
*inal proceedings against parties who took
part in fraudulent voting at the primary
election that was held last August/ which
resulted in conviction and: the sending of
one person to the State prison and one to
the County Jail. Altogether the associa
tion brought ten suits last year. 'The.di
rectors' reported that the, results .'have
been most' gratifying and the action, of
the association has - : been . heartily and
widely commended. :';'Â£\u25a0: ' â¢
The.- status' of the .civil service cases
was reported to be as follows: An injunc
tion in Quinn.vs. Baehr, involving. the en
joining of payment of the salary demands
of the deputy health officer; and; four in
specting physicians,' is still in force; in
Symmes vs. Baehr two suits were brought
to prevent the payment of the salaries
of fifteen deputy registrars, because, the
&*<?puties were : appointed in violation â¢: of
the civil service provisions of the charter.
In these Judge Sloss decided; in favor of
the legal merits of, the contentions of the
association, and the case is still pending,
awaiting a trial on the questions of fact.
Judge Sloss decided 'on;the legal, points
last August. "As these questions of fact
are all matters of public record," so re
ported the directors, "they are easily sus
ceptible of proof, so that the case may
be considered practically won."

; It is common conjecture in political cir
cles \u25a0 that ' Ruef will | manage |in some .way
to reorganise, reconstruct or resurrect the
Union Labor party and again put Eugene
E.' Schmitz in the field to oppose the: Re
piTjlicaii;nominee; for Mayor., In the mu
nicipal contest two T ; years ;ago Ruef was
one of the inside managers of the Repub-.
llcan campaign until the eleventh hour,
and at that- hour, went over_to the opposi
tion. The managers of the San Francisco
Republican League, are, quite firm in the
belief that he .will not get the
nity to ; betray the Republican party. In
the municipal campaign of -1905. The boss
of , .the Schmitz. administration will- not
get control of the Republican convention
this year without making an open tight
at the primary election for such , control.
If good citizens keep, away from the
polls 'and permit the eleption of Ruef del
egates to the Republican convention they
will -deserve the punishment of another
administration of Ruef and Schmitz.

You and Your Food are a Misfit Sure
It's a relief to feel the sunshine and glow of perfect health,
bounding energy and "go" of the .successful, brimful-of-spirits ,
mzn. The joy of living real LIFE will. come- back when you
gire yonr body the kind of food it is mutely appealing for, that
from which it can make good the daily waste caused by brain
work and exertion. ,
Suppose you abandon for a time the food which evidently
is not properly nourishing you, and go in for a io-day test and
ace how near the food expert, who perfected
Grape = Nuts
/ ..\u25a0'\u25a0,
comes to yonr case. Drop tea and coffee absolutely, and if you
wast to get to the front by bounds cut your tobacco down to at
least one-half.
Now for breakfast.
A little vciy ripe fruit, a saucer of Grape- Nuts (not over 4
heaping teaspoonfuls with some rich cream poured over it, in-
sist on cream, milk will do as a last resort, but waterrspoils^ "the
delicate sweet flavor), a slice of very/ hard-baked toast,^ tliinly
buttered, and a cup of Postnm Food Coffee. No more.
That will carry you until hjnch time, wberi the same articles
can be used,, and add a little hotxlear soap.';.
Take- dinner at 6 or 7- and have a generous portion of meat,
only one kind. Cat out the soup and fishj have 2 vegetables and*\
& Grape-Nuts padding, a cup of Postum Food Coffee; (which will:
not keep yoa awake) and one or two slices of . buttered toast. *
QUIT THERE.
Two days tiros will open voter eyes and 10 daysv make this \u25a0
good old world seem a happy place again. r
It's nice to be happy.

THE DISCOVERER
Of Lydia E; Pinkham-8 Vegetable; Compound, the
Great Woman's Remedy for JjVoman's Ills;
No other female medicine in the world has received such widespread and
unqualified endorsement. .
No other medicine has such a record of cures of female troubles or saeh"
hosts of grateful friends as has t ' I- \u25a0
'â Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
It will entirely cure the worst forms* of Female Complaints, all Ovarian
Troubles, Inflammation and U lceration. Falling" ; and Displacement of the
Womb, and consequent Spinal Weakness, and is peculiarly adapted to the
Change of Life.' J . .
It has cured more cases of Backache and Leucorrhcea than any other rem-
edy, the world* has ever known. It is almost infallible in such cases. It
dissolves and expels tumors from the Uterus in an early stage rf da-
' velopment. ,.
Irregular, Suppressed or Painful Menstruation^ Weakness of the Stomach,
Indigestion, Bloating, Flooding, Nervous Prostration, Headache, General Debil-
ity quickly yield to it. ; Womb troubles, causing pain, weight and backache, in-
stantly relieved and permanently cured by its use. Under all circumstances it
invigorates the female system," and is as harmless as water.
It quickly removes that Bearing-down Feeling, extreme lassitude, *' don't
care" and" want-to-be-left-alone " feeling, excitability, irritability, nervous-
ness. Dizziness, Faintness, sleeplessness, flatulency, melancholy or the "blues"
and headache. These are sure indications of Female Weakness, or some de-
rangement of the U terus, which this medicine always cures. Kidney Complaints
and Backache, of either sex, the Vegetable Compound always cures,
r Those women who refuse to accept anything else are rewarded a hundred
thousand times, for they, get what they wantâ a cure. Sold by Druggist*
everywhere. Refuse all substitutes.Sncred;. Heart Bnzaar.

BEATTLE, May 18.â Ragged ball
â¢Â»-as played in spots by both sides to
day, but Oakland bunched errors when
they would do the most harm and gave
Seattle the lead after 1 having a good
margin themselves. Schmidt pitched
steady balL Shields tried the experi
ment of not pitching a curve ball and
he got avray with it. A bad error by
Francks and a foolish throw, by Byrnes
with two men . out in the fifth helped
give Seattle four runs, after the side
ahould have been retired. Kemmer
wax the only man to err for Seattle,
fie missed a pop-up and then let a
taut roll between his legs. He atoned
for it in part by batting in two runs
in a pinch. Frary's hand was hurt. by
a foul tip and Dashwood relieved him

The ball game at Recreation Park yea
terfiEy consumed enough time to plea6e
any old kind of a fan, but most of the
period was covered by kicks, wraneles |
and ether objectionable things to which I
ball games frequently fall heir. Jimmy
Wbalen was banished in tho midst of the
excitement and Wheeler finished the bat
tle. The Seals won, 6 to 3.
The ball players took exception to
â¢verythlngr Bull Perine said. â¢ Nothing
â¢eemed to go for them. Everybody was
yelling and the more they yelled thf
worse affairs became. Finally Jimmy
Whalen became so bad in the third inning
that the umpire had to chase him in or
der to make good. Jimmy made his get
-away in company of a cop.
In the meantime the Seals were wal
loping Mr. French. They became friend
ly with his twists during the third and
two runt followed after three bingles had
been tocn off. This was enough for
French and he sought the bench in favor
of Virgil Garvinl
Garvin's debut seemed to be an omen
of success for the Giants. They com
menced to get into the going right away.
With men on second and third and two
down, Eddie Householder lifted a high
one to center. It looked like a dead one,
but Waldron could not quite catch up to
it and it dropped safely, letting both men
pass through.
The deadlock did not last .Jong. The
Seals could hit almost anything Garvln
sent over when hits were needed. They
grabbed another tally in the fourth and
in the sixth a couple more were annexed.
The Giants landed once again in the
eighth, when a pair of two baggers by
Householder and McCreedie let a run reg
ister. The score:

The amended ordinance presented <by
the Hawthorne Club differs from the old
one in four particulars. The Pacific Ath
letic Association is cutout as the govern
ing body; the 5250 license Is eliminated;
no professional club can hold aa amateur
fight and no amafeur club can hold a pro
fessional fight and contestants are to be
allowed money for training expenses' 1 in
addition to a troshy. \u25a0
During the course of the dlscttasion
Chairman Boxton said: "W* have had a
lot of trouble .over these amateur per
mits and we want to go on record now
as saying that the promoting clubs must
be members of the ' Pacific Athletic 'As
sociation. We advise the ! clubs to. get
together, as no more permits wiH be
Issued until this is straightened out.**
Mr. - Peixotto said the people he rep
resents did not want the ' sport dragged
into 1 the mire. .They wanted to prevent
the small fights, which are held too fre
quently, and to protect the big boxing.
President Harrison said the Grand Jury
and not himself stopped the Hawthorne
Club fights recently. He said the Olym
pic Club had no ill f eellng toward the
other . clubs, but that the amateur ques
tion must be settled. He has asked the
club to set aside $10,000 to bring the best
boxers of the Amateur Athletic Union ta
this coast to box in its gymnasium, with
genuine amateurs. . /'
The Police Committee took the matter
of amending the ordinance â¢ governing
amateur fights under advisement for two
weeks. .' No permits will be Issued until
seme agreement i 3 reached on the ordi
nance. William Greer Harrison and Ed
gar D. Peixotto were present as repre
sentatives of the Olympic Club. There
were . also representatives present from
the various clubs which \u25a0 have promoted
these fights.
Sam Berber's hopes of blossoming
out as a prizefight promoter were blast
ed yesterday by the Supervisors'^ Police
Committee. Sam was the manager of
the Western Athletic Club and counted
on handling the proposed Nelson-Britt
| fight next month.
When the committee met applications
' were on file for the coveted sanction
ifrom the Hayes Valley. â¢*\u25a0 Uncoln and
Western clubs. With, but lfttle discus
sion the Hayes Valley Club was granted
the July permit, while that for August
went to the Lincoln Athletic Club.
which is new in thÂ» professional field.
When the matter came up Berger was
granted a hearing. He seemed to know
he was fighting for a lost cause and
used no diplomacy in his" speech. HÂ«
said he did oot think it was the policy
of the board to confine the promoting
of fights to two dubs, saying the San
Francisco Club has received three per
mits and the Hayes Valley two for thÂ«
first fly* months of the * year. He did
â¢ not see why- they should have a monop
oly of the game. His club had complied
with all tho requirements of the ordi
nance and his associates^ expected .thÂ«
same - consideration others received.
TWO PERMITS ARK GRAXTED.
; Eusrene PfaefQe. secretary of the Lin
coln Club, said his club would be satis
fied with the August permit If they
could not get the one for July.
Berger added he had Nelson and Brltt
signed, the. former having been repre
sented by Nolan. Morris Levy said he
had the signature of Nelson. He had a
flfng at Willie Brltt, saying: "Yon said
you wouldn't do business with Nolan."
Supervisor Eggers then moved that
the July permit be awarded the Hayes
Valley Club. Supervisor Boxton. the
chairman, asked: "Any objection? No!
Well," I don't object."
Egsers then moved that the Lincoln
Club be granted the August permit. ThÂ»
chairman asked: "Any objection?" Mc-
Clellan said: "Yes!" Boxton replied:, "I
don't. It is recommended. McClellan
then asked that the vote be made unan
imous.
It has become a standing Joke to claim
that Jim Coffroth is behind each new
club which asks for recognition. The
story was circulated vigorously last night
that he is Interested in the Lincoln Ciub
and that it will promote the Nelson-Britt
fight in August. .-. .
While Morris Levy holds tha signature
of Battling Nelson he does not seem to
expect to bring the Dane and Britt to
gether next month. The $2500 forfeit put
up by the Western Athletic Club guaran
teeing its ability- to promote the Ndlson-
Britt fight next month has -oeen returned
to the property man at the Central
Theater and will play its accustomed part
in the melodramas produced there.

XEW YORK, May 18.â Loss of confidence
Jn vsJues showed a notable growth during
the pineress of to-day's trading in stocks and
a movement of eryux animation to liquidate
\u25a0was the consequeSte. " Professional traders
\u25a0were very persistent and diligent on the short
side of Uie market. Tbere was hasty selling
by speculative pools which have made un-
SA-aiUng efforts to get prices up and the
decline in prices brought other Belling
by tie Impairment of margins and the
â¢uaccrverlrg of stop-loss orders. The
downward course was not established
\u25a0without a struggle and a contest by
friends of higher prices, and tbe level vibrated
many times during the course of the morn
ing under the conflicting Influence of operations
on opposite sides of the market. Operations
for the advance centered again on t**e trans
continental group and St_ Paul. Union Pacific
and Southern Padflc at different times showed
cr.-ns'der&Ue strength. But the over-accumu
latioa of these stocks In the effort to sup
port the market made them weaker than the
average when the unloading process began. It
cannot be Eaid that any important news de
veloped during the day. but there was a very
earnest discussion of a number of points In the
oatlook which have been brought into atten
tion in the last few days. The principal texU
of the discussion by the professional operators
were on the announced policy of the admin
istration to purchase the Panama Canal sup
piles In foreign markets where that could be
done more cheaply and the admitted lull in
the iron and steel trade. These two items
of discussion worked together In their effect
as It was assumed that the canal materials
woold ccnie mostly from iron and steel prod-
TJcta. The political phases of the question re
ceived much attention of a more or less ex
pert character in accordance with the usual
versatility of the average stock trader's knowl
edge. The opening up of the whole sublet
of tartS revision and the danger of unsettle
reent of the whole Industrial and financial
fabric were pointed to with assurance In the
expressed opinions of the bear traders who
were selling stocks short. The reassuring opln
iocs from steel trade authorities that .the
present lull in demand was likely to prove
temporary were disregarded. It was argued
that the present high rate of consumption
muÃt represent not only that for current
Xiâim. but also confident anticipation of- fu
ture cecds and that with the prospect, of
prices becoming unstapK buying In all grades
would quickly fall to the limits of actual re
quirements. The liquidation of the United
States Eteel stocks In consequence came from
all quMtera, selling for London account form,
ing an important proportion of the-- whole.
"With the news of the action of the Northern
Pacific stockholders showing a general retire
ment of the Unlcn Pacific element from the
directorate, a wave of distrust swept over the
market regarding the persistent rumors of the
\u25a0working cut of the projects for community of
Interests In the Northwest by exchange of
holdings In different railroads. The occasion
\u25a0was not neglected, as soon as the tone of de
pression was well established. . to bring out a
crop scare and reports were heard that serious
Gjunage by exeeeitva moisture to the winter
wheat crop In the Southwest. There was not
a rlppJÂ« la the money market to explain the
argent liquidation, which became precipitate
In the final <seelir.es. making the closing very
weak and at about the lowest.'

Tbe condition of the grain crop continues
satisfactory. There are some complaints of
fall whew turning yellow, confined principally
to that sown on low land Rye oats and bar
1Â«T arÂ» dotnr nicely, while spring wheat has
etooled well and la very promising. Hops con-
Unu* enevon and the cool weather has re
tarded growth. In some portions of Polk
County the second training of the vines Is in
progress. Meadow grass, clover and pastures
ere growing rabidly. Alfalfa is backward and
a light "first crop" is Indicated. Gardens,
potatoes, corn, sugar beets, field oalons and
beans are growing elowly, and warm, sunshiny
\u25a0weather is needed before these crops can re
scrae their normal growth. Ccrn is coming
vp cult* evenly acd enough rain has fallen
to Insure a good, healthy stand. Dairy and
range stock continue in fine condition.
Reports relative to the frait crop 'continue
very conflicting. In some localities whole
orchards eeera to be bare of fruit, while others
near by Indicate fairly good yields. This Is
also true of individual trees, some being well
eat with fruit, while others have none. Prunes,
peaches and early cherries have suffered most,
however, while other tree fruit promises fa r
7b* report of Edward A. Bsala. section dl
factor, VtiiUA States Weather Bureau, for tbe
Ortgrm Crop Bulletin, week ended May 16, is
aÂ« follows:
Tbe weatbsr during the past week was
â¢bowery aad too cold for crops to make satis*
iaetery advancement. Good rains fell In all
\u25a0action* of the State, these occurring in the
western portion being especially copious and
timely.
OrÂ«st>n Crop Bulletin-
COTTON â â¢The market if an excellent sealp
t&ff on* a&d while crop prospects continue
fcad. we look for much higher prices. The
trade Mem* to be drifting from the stock
market Into. pottos aad Grala. and It looks
a* tboogb. wÂ» would have an active market

w* thlr.k It safe to purchase Cotton on all

} The New Tork wires of E. F. Hutton & Co.
yesterday said:
STOCKS â â¢â¢Crop damage reports and contin
ued fceavy Belling of Steels, and new low rec
ords, cauÂ«Â«d heavy selling. We are getting
ear flret crop scares and It is likely theee fac
tors will be well discounted now and the usual
Hay declines in the securities market will be
witaersed. Sensational reports about rain in
the WÂ«st aad etorfes of shutting down mills
aad Blasts of steel corporations are coming
thick asd faej, but you can rest aisured that
they are not true. Tbe steel trade is getting
a natural setback or dullness from the recent
rapid pace of six months, tout orders on hand
will tÂ« forthcoming for a long period to keep
all It* x&llla busy, and a week of cloudless
\u25a0ft'Ba.ther wIU make crops finer than ever. It

-The foregoing are the startling extracts
from the *dissenting opinion of one of the
ablest jurists in the United States and.two
of his associates. His remarks were called
forth by the opinion of the United States
Supreme Court in the case of the United
States vs. Ju Toy. * ? As . related in the
opinion of 'the-' court, Ju ;Toy : sought-ad
mission at this pert on the ground that he
was a native citizen of the United States.
The' local immigrant officials decided; that
his claim was not, well founded and denied
him a landing. On the " appeal the' Secre
tary of the Department of Commerce and
Labor, sustained the action of the < local
immigrant* officials. Then Ju r Toy was
granted a writ of habeas -corpus by the
. United States District Court, and \u25a0 upon
the hearing the court: found that Ju' Toy
was a native citizen of this \u25a0 country.
From this decision the United States Dis
trict '.Attorney ; appealed to I- the "United
\u25a0 States Circuit Court of Appeals," and that
court submitted to the United States Su
preme Court substantially . these ' three
propositions: -^ -

The application" of counsel representing
Ada R. Duncan, who recently obtained a
divorce from B. 8.. Duncan, to^ stay all
proceedings taken by Duncan looking to
an appeal of the case was deniel by Judge
Seawell yesterday. It was contended that
Duncan should be denied the right" to
prosecute his defense further until such
ume as he pays his former wife alimony
as ordered by the court, it being alleged
that "he has contemptuously refused to
obey the letter cf the decree." -
Caroline Stains Castle Jackson ; Smyth
was granted a divorce from Thomas Mor
rison Smyth by Judge Hebbard yesterday,
desertion being â¢ the ground. The Smyths
were married in 1837. : Decrees iof divorce
were also granted \u25a0- to ,- Charles F. Reimer
from Agnes M. Reimer for cruelty," Mar
tha J. Collins from Major C. Collins for
failure to provider George S. Woodward
from Eugenia Woodward for desertion,
Pauline Breeser from Gustav Breeser for
willful neglect, A. G:;Rich from Agnes
Rich for desertion, j Fannie Y. Close irom

Suit for annulment of marriage, contain
ing several remarkable allegations, was
Tiled yesterday by Jennie IZ Echenberger-
McKinley against f Sidney H. ; McKiriley.
Mrs. McKinley says that she married Mc-
Kinley on November 24, 1904." in Lake
County. At the. time the ceremony was
performed, alleges Mrs. MtKinley,' sine
was under 18 years of age and hence could
not give legal consent to the performance
of the ceremony. I As soon as she discov
ered that she had been deceived, she says
she left heÂ« husband and has not lived
with him since. Just how she was de
ceived she does not state.; Her allegation
that she left him when she discovered she
had been "deceived"; gives ground for the
theory that she did not live with him up
to the time of the discovery, thus making
it apparent that her allegation that* she
was deceived is based on the that
her husband, before - taking â¢; her as his
bride, should have told her that girls un
der IS cannot, marry without the consent
of their parents. jpffS
Tbe inexplicable brutality of Patrick J.
O'Donneli. a plumber, who. formerly re
sided with ras family at 1134 Kentucky
street, was brought to light in Judge Heb
bard's court yesterday when bis wife, Re
becca, presented her proofs in support of
her petition for a divorce on the ground of
extreme, cruelty.
Mrs. O'Donneli. wbo is a woman of deli
cate physique, testified that her husband
horrified her at the time of the death of
their first born in November, 1902. by tell
ing her not to grieve for/ the child, **f or
it was much cheaper to bury a kid than
it was to raise it."
Later, she testified, when her twin ba
bies were ill her husband refused to send
for medical attendance,' again asserting
his brutal theory, that it was cheaper to
bury the little ones than it was to buy
medicine and food for them. This story
in itself was sufficient to demonstrate to
the court that O'Donneli was not fit for
the association of any self-respecting per
son, but when . Mrs. : O'Donneli further
proved that O'Donnell frequently returned
homo drank; and ; was filthy at the house
the court stopped the hearing and granted
the> decree forthwith.' Mrs, O'Donnell in
formed the court that her husband had
not given her a cent for a year, and Judge
Hebbard issued an order, directing him. to
pay her J4O immediately and a like sum
each month in the future for. the support
of the twins. '- .

arid 'Stood them in a row to see which looked .the best x Two were in Eton's, blue/and

-â¢:â¢.; ..It was.difficult to:tell which looked the; neatest and the six mothers who were present
refused to express an absolute preference. They did agree, however, that they- had never
seen such an arrayof children's wear so uniformly handsome.
