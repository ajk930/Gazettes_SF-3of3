MERCHANT'S
WIFE FOILS
DEPORTERS
Clasped in the arms of his little j
eleven- year-old daughter. Rudolph ,
Schultze. a prominent shipbuilder of j
113S Fifth avenue south, died yester
day afternoon, the victim of a mur
derer's bullet.
He was slain in the presence of his
wife, daughter and brother, who
dumb-stricken at the sight of the un
expected and awfut deed, were unable
to render the unfortunate man any as
sistance. Gustav S^h^rf, a deputy i
poundkeeper residing at 11 Holliday
avenue, is in the Cfty Prison charced ;
with Schuitze's murder. ,
Down on Fifth avenue south a
scravrny little pug dog. the cause o?
the murder, runs around, unmindful of
the part it played in .the late tragedy
that befell its master, and in the house,
prostrated over the loss of their dearest
friend and protector, sit the dead man's
wife, children and brother.
Rudolph Schultze attempted to save
his dog and lost his life. A pound,
wagon in charge of Deputy Poundmen'
Charles Weintraut, Arthur Murphy and
Gustav. Scherf stopped In front of the
boat yards. Weintraut and Murphy
jumped from the vehicle and started
after Schultze's dog. Scharf sat upon
{he wagon. Rudolph Schultze and his
brother William were .working â in th*Â»
boat yards. At the sight of the pound
men Rudolph ran into the street to
drive the dog Into his yard. He had a
hammer in his hand which he had
been using but a moment before. As
he tried to get the animal, into the
yard he was pushed away by Murphy,
who used his long-handled dog-catch
ing net to keep the master from the
dosf. Eye witnesses say that Murphy
threw the net over Schultze's head,
while the poundmen aver that Schultze
became entangled in it through his own
struggles. The net enveloped Schultze
and as he struggled to free himself
Schsrf, who was sitting on the wagon,
raised himself to a standing position,
drew a large 44-calibe-r Colt's re
volver and coolly fired at the men
caught in the meshes of the net. With
a cry. "I'm shot." Schultze reeled. A*
he did so Murphy released the net and
the mortally wounded man staggered
toward his house across the street. As
he reached the steps his little girl.
Ethel, who saw the whole tragedy from
the window, ran down to assist him.
CHILD KISSES DY1.XG FATHER.
Schultze managed to mount 5 three
steps and then sank overcome from
loss of blood.
"Kiss me, Ethel, dear," were the last
words he ever uttered, and as his lips
met for the last time those of his be
loved child he toppled over on his face
âdead.
William Schultze. the victim's
brother, and a neighbor who witnessed
the' murder, rushed to the wounded
man's side. He was carried Into his
home and doctors were called, but
Schultze was dead. Some say they
discerned a faint smile on his lips, for
he had perished with the warm kiss ot
his child upon him like a benediction.
The murder was witnessed by Wil- ;
Ham Schultze. the dead man's brother.
Ethel, his daughter, and Fred Schu
macher, a butcher of 1109 Fifth avenue
south. Schumacher said: "I was stand
ing on the hill above the street and
saw the pound wagon drive up. One
of the men threw a net over Schultze's
head. Schultze struggled to get free.
While be and the man with the net
were struggling the other poundman
caught the dosr and threw it in the
wagon. All this time Scherf sat on the
wagon watching the conflict. Of a
sudden, as if by some mad impulse,
he reached under the wagon seat, drew
forth a revolver, rose In his seat and
fired point blank at Schultze- Schultze
reeled and the man with the net let
him - loose. As he staggered up ? hl3
stairs I ran to assist him. The driver,
after he had shot Schultze, called to his
men, 'Come on here, you fellows: let's
get out of this.'- William Schultze ran
toward the wagon as If to attack
Scherf. Scherf. uttering a vile oath. lev
eled his gun at him and said. 'Come an
other, step and I'll give it to you-; too/
"William then ; said, -Toti have shot. my
brother. * LÂ«t the dog co.'The pound-
Murphy and Weintraut were placed
under arrest by Lewis and Macphee
and taken to the Potrero station, and
afterward to the Hall of Justice. They
told a straight story to Captain Mar
tin, who. realizing that they took no
part in the murder, allowed them to
go. Scherf was booked foT murder.
The Pc-trero and South San Francisco
ponce stations were notified. Sergeant'
Lewis was at the South San Francisco
station and jumped into his buggy and
drove rapidly to the scene of the mur-,
cer. t indiugr j the iÂ»oundrnÂ«;n tied.
Lewis telephoned for extra men to
cover the escape of the fugitives from
the peninsula of land on which they,
were driving. 5 He sent Policeman Mac
phee over the hills south of Fifth ave-.
nue to Intercept the flight of the men,
which he believed would be toward the
neck of the peninsula. Sergeant Lewis
then drove madly to head' off the
poundmen should they pass before
Macphee could cut them off. Macphee
secured a saddle horse and caught the
wagon on Fifteenth avenue, ,but Scherf
was gone. In his place driving was a
man named Charley Ford of 801 M
street, a character known around the
saloons in that part of the city. Fear
ing to be taken, Scherf, -after he had
passed Hunters Point, met Ford, then
Jumped from the vehicle and calling to
Ford to take the reins, made south over
.the hills. He was afterward arrested by
Detectives Cody and Whltaker, hiding
in the house of Mrs. Samuel Pierce,
wife of the bookkeeper for the pound
keeper. . ~
After Schexf had fired the fatal shot
he called, "Onw 1 on here, you fellows.
Let's get nutpf this." Without waiting
even to assiit the wtaunded man into
his house or ascertain the extent of his
injuries, Afurphy and Weintraut
mounted the' wagon, and Scherf, whip
ping up his lorses, drove at a mad rate
toward 'Hunters Point.
Rudolph Schultze Deliberately Murdered by Gustav Scherf
In a Struggle Over a Little Dog.
Arthur Murphy of 1790 Howard
street, the other deputy, corroborated
Weintraut's statement and added that
he had placed the gun under the seat.
"I secured it from Alfred Johnson, a
proceryiuan at Fifteenth and Folsom
streets, eight days ago to clean. It was
not loaded when;. I placed it on the
wagon to return to Johnson. Gus must
have loaded it."
Scherf says there was a crowd at
tacking him and his partners, but eye
witnesses say there was no one near
but the Schultze brothers, until after
the shooting.
The man charged 'with murder is
24 years of age and has been with the
pound for some time. Detective Cody
says that his reputation -is not good.
Rudolph Schultze vrdt 45 years of
age and a native son. He leaves a
widow,' two children and three brothers.
With his brothers; "William and Au

"I. shot in self-defense. There was aj
crowd of men with hatchets, hammers ;
and sticks coming at us and I had to j
ehoot. I did not intend to kill the man. j
but when I grabbed the pistol it went
off. It was not my pistol, and I do
not know who loaded it."
The rest of Scherfs statement was
an utterance of denials of the stories
told by eye-witnesses. First he said
that- he "shot' in eelf-defense. Â¦ then thÂ»
gun went off by accident- Scherfs aim.
however, was deadly. The bullet passed
through Schultze's lungs and Internal
hemorrhage caused death.
SHOT WAS UNPROVOKED.
Charles Weintraut, the deputy pound,
man, made the following statement:
"We stopped to catch Schultze's dog.
Schultze got caught' in Murphy's net.
He had a hammer in his hand and in
the struggle hit Murphy In the back.
I do not think the blow was intended,
but was merely the result of Schultze's
struggles. *I heard the shot, then heard
Schultze say 'I'm shot.' I turned and
saw Gus (meaning Scherf) standing on j
the front of the wagon with a gun in [
his hand. Billy Schultze advanced to- f
ward the wagon, and Gus said to him: }
'If you come any nearer, I'll shoot]
you. too.' I yelled to Gus. 'You have
done a cold-blooded murder; for' God's
sake put up that gun. Are you crazy?'
Then we Jumped into the wagon and i
drove off. We met that fellow Ford!
on Fifteenth avenue and Scherf called j
to him to take the wagon and ran over ;
the hill3 to the south." !
men threw out the doe, whipped the
horses into a furious gait and went in
the direction of Hunters Point."
BROTHER SAW MURDER.
William Schultze's statement was in
the main the same as Schumacher's.
H<* says his brother made no attempt
to strike the men, but merely strujrsled
in an attempt to release himself from
the meahes of the net; that Scherf fired
the shot deliberately and without prov
ocation.
Scherf was taken before Captain

vene in this city to-morrow. The con
vention promises to be the most im
portant ever held by the party In the
State. A number of delegates arrived
this evenlnc and the rest of them are
expected on the early trains in the
morning. There are two candidates for
Congressional honors in. the Fifth Dis
trict. Dr. George B. Pratt of this city
is the cholcÂ« of the delegates of this
county and It is said that San Fran
cisco will present the name of Robert
Thompson.
Boyne being a" Fire Commissioner
under the Schmltz administration led
to the belief ; that' he would under no
circumstances fight the Democratic
candidate, who has a labor following.
The precipitation of Boyne's candi
dacy in the Fourth seems at this. time
to be premature. The -district, con
vention is not scheduled to meet until
September 22, San Francisco being
the place. About all that can be done
here will be in the nature of agitation,
the effect of which can only be deter
mined when the convention la called
in -session.'-,'; . â¢ Â¦- * ,
SANTA CRUZ, Aug. 24. â There was
considerable excitement when Abe
Ruef arrived with his contingent on
the 10:30 o'clock train and some whis
pering as to the part that he will play
in the fight for Congress in the Fifth
District. Ruef probably has a num
ber of strom? cards up his sleeve to
help strengthen some hand, but he
will not play them before to-morrow
morning unless an after midnight ses
sion gives him opportunity to show
down part. of his plans. |
Ruef soueht a conference with the
Hayes brothers soon after Â¦ his arrival
and there was some talk that a com
promise was likely to be effected before
the day dawns, but this is not proba
ble. There also is talk that D. W.
Burchard.will be put in the field as a
candidate if E. A. Hayes determines to
eliminate himself from the contest. C.
M. Shortridge has a strong machine
following and his name may go before
the convention in opposition to Hayes.
J; George Boyne was not counted on
as a candidate for ; office, but he sur
prised everybody by announcing him
self in line for the Congressional nom
ination in the Fourth District. That
Boyne would consent to run against E.
J. Livernash seemed to puzzle most of
the delegates, but Boyne expressed sur
prise that the mention of his name
would create such an Impression.
Piro Commissioner Is a Candidate for
Congressional Honors.
BOYXE IN THE FIGHT.
State Senator Thomas Flint of San Benito With
draws Fron/ the Fight fop Renomination.
SANTA CRUZ. Aug| 24.â There is
peace In the Republic^ ranks in the
Thirty-first Senatorial >T>istrict, com
prising the counties . o) San Benito j
Monterey and San LuWoblspo. X.ate
this evening . Senator Flint
buried his aspirations ftr renomination
and Henry "W. Lynch of San Luis
Obispo will receive t)e nomination
when the district contention meets.
Senator Flint's action n withdrawing
from the fight at this ime is warmly
commended by the Repnbllcans gath
; ered here and has wok him many'
friends. Flint and LyÂ»h met in the
lobby of the Sea Beach Hotel this aft
ernoon, and at the (suggestion of
friends entered into a |onference for
the purpose of arriving, if possible, at
some agreement that wiuld eliminate
the Impending contest ti the district
convention. Lynch madehis case clear j
and convincing. At the conclusion of
the conference Flint announced that he
would withdraw from tile fight and
throw all his strength to Lynch
thanked him for his action and prom
ised to be equally conBidefate If the oc
casion offered in the futlre.
"Yes, I yielded to the (jesires of Mr.
Lynch, who is a warm personal
friend," said Flint. "It is now my in
tention of getting In behijd Lynch and
we will make the fight together to se
cure his election. Workiig together I
am sure we can rout the enemy with
out difficulty and am equally sure that
after the enemy is routed the voters of
our district will find an efficient repre
sentative in Mr. Lynch."
"I am here to meet the various mem-
bers of the Legislature that may attend
the convention and others that may
be nominated here," said Frank P.
Flint, candidate for United States
Senator, to-night, "though my most
active eompaign will be made later.
It is my intention to travel over the
State and address the voters as well
as the legislators before the fight is
over. As to the announcement that I
have entered into a coalition with Mr.
Oxnard by which, in event of impend
ing defeat, I am to throw my strength
to him, it is absolutely false. I am
poing to make the fight for myself and
have every hope of winning. I am
supported not only by the younger ele
ment of the party, but by many of the
old-line politicians, who say they will
support me to the last unless the pro
gramme is .made too strong for them
to buck against. From the first vote to
the last I will be in the fight, and if
success does .not crown my efforts it
will be the last ballot In favor of the
successful candidate that will stop me
ânot any combination or coalition, for
I have not entered into one."
Oxnard, who Is accompanied by L. W.
Andrews, his southern manager, and
George Hatton, who has been watching
out for his. interests in' the north, also
denies the coalition story and says he
is in town actuated by the same im
pulses that are responsible for the
presence of Flint. He also asserts that
he is in the fight to the finish, the dis
couragements he has met In the south
in no wise dampening his ardor nor
affecting his plan of campaign. Ox
nard asserts that he would not change
prospects with any other aspirant for
the favor of the Legislature.

LJST OF DELEGATES.
At the recent primaries eleven dele
gates were elected in Contra Co3ta
County pledged to support C. M. Bel
shaw of Antioch in his fight for re
nomination for Senator. Marin elected
a delegation of eight which is solid
for E. B. Martinelli of San Rafael.
Under the rule that has long pre
vailed In the district by which the
State offices alternate between the two .
counties that compose It, Marin
claimed that Belshaw should not suc
ceed himself, but that Marin should
be conceded the right to name thÂ« Sen
ator.
But in the present fnstance Contra
Costa refused to concede the point.
The lines had been too closely drawn
at the primaries and the fight was too
bitter to stand by old customs, so it
was announced that Belshaw was in
the fight to win.
Here the scandal broke, but In no
way does it involve Marin County, its
delegation or it* aspirant for State
Senator. Belshaw displeased certain In
terests in his own county, and wheiv
It was given out that he was in the
fight to stay and refused the right of
Marin to name the candidate for thft
coming term the "anti-Belshaw push,"
as it is known in Contra Costa, began
to scheme to work his undoing.
Judge Hough, a Belshaw delegate of
Contra Costa, informed his associates
yesterday morning that an effort had
been made to secure on his part the
commission of an act of political trea
son. Notwithstanding the fact that ha
was elected and pledged to support Bel
shaw. he told his associates In the
delegation that he had been approached
by L. R. Palmer of "Walnut Creek, who
informed him that if he would desert
the Belshaw camp and aid in Belshaw's
knifing- a position In the internal reve
nue office would be placed at his dis
posal, the position to be .worth $130
a month for the first four months and
$150 a month thereafter until the end
of the present administration. When
Palmer was asked what influences let!
him to believe that a position In the
revenue office was at his disposal for
public barter, Judge Hough Informed
his associates that Palmer referred
him to Supervisor James Stow of Con
tra Costa and dwelt on Stow's close
association with Revenue Officials
Lynch and Borland.
Judpe Hough's story brought forth
furtherevider.ee that an effort to create
Internal strife in the Contra Costa dele
gation had been made. Hugh Grant of
Richmond, a Belshaw delegate, Inti
mated that if he chose to commit po
litical treason he could secure a reward
from the element that was out to knife
Belshaw. Others had a similar tale
to tell, but all "stood pat' and came
into town to-night solid for Belshaw.
Marin'3 delegation, though .anxious
to secure the nomination of Martinelli.
condemned the method that had be^n
used in an effort to defeat Belshaw. The
delegation disclaimed all knowledge of
the affair and the Contra Costa men
were anxious that the Martinelli sup
porters be abFolved from all connection
with the affair. Marin's delegation an
nounced that it would endeavor to se
cure a conference with the Contra
Costa people to-morrow morning and
arrive at an amicable settlement, but
that if Contra Costa refused tp recede
from its position it would do the beet
it could and vote solid for Martinelli.
SANTA CRUZ, Auc 24.â Federal
patronaee is the green-eyed monster
that has again broken the political
peace of Contra Costa County and out
of the disturbance a scandal has been
evolved in which several well-known
names form a conspicuous part. Not
long after the delegations of Contra
Costa and Marin counties, which com
pose the Ninth Senatorial District, ar
rived in town to-night, rumors began
to gain circulation that the Contra
Costa men had on their war paint and
investigation disclosed the following
state of affairs:
Political Plums Are Offered His Con
stituent* to Betray Him.
FIGHT AGAINST BELSHAW.
Mr chairman and gentlemen of the con
vention: I am at a loss for words with which
GdBrge G. Radcllff of Santa Cruz, for
mer Congressman James A. Louttit of
Stockton, Senator Thomas Flint. San
Benito, and delegates from each of the
other counties in the district made sec
onding speeches.
During the speech-making. In .which
Needham's popularity in his district and
the probabilities of the easy manner
in which he will dispose of his oppo
nent were referred to often and firmly.
William. M. Conley. the Democratic
nominee that seeks Needham's position,
was in the convention hall, the mark
for many jests and shafts of wit. He
took the" situation good naturedly.
When all the counties in the district
had been heard from in the matter of
seconding the nomination of Needham
a motion that the nominations close
prevailed and Needham was named by
acclamation. Needham was then es
corted to the platform. In part he
said:
NKEDIIAM THANKS ; DELEGATES.
Chairman Hill joined in the applause
that greeted the reading of the plat
form and then called for nominations
for Congressman. L. L- Dennett, who
first placed Needham In nomination for
Congress six years ago, was recognized,
and he took the platform to again of
fer the name of Needham for the con
sideration of the convention.
MAXX SECONDING SPEECHES.
"We commend President Roosevelt and con
gratulate the people of the State of California
upon the selection of our distinguished fellow
citizen, the Hon. V. H. Metcalf. as Secretary
of Commerce and Labor In the Cabinet of the
President. His experience In Congress and his
high character and ability make his appoint

We commend the administration of Governor

We congratulate the people of tn:s Congres
sional district upon being so ably represented
In Congress by the Hon. J. C. Needham, whose
untiring energy and activity have been of Ines
timable benefit to the people of the district
which he lias represented and to the State
at large. Serving now his third consecutive
term and being the oldest member In continu
ous service from this State, his re-election at
this time Is of more importance than ever.
His membership upon the Committee of Pub
lic Lands and Insular Affairs, committees hav
ing Jurisdiction of questions of vital impor
tance to the Pacific slope, and his re-election
presaging his appointment to committees- of
still greater importance makes. Ms return by
an increased majority of the highest Impor
tance to the material and- public interests of
the State without regard to party.

plan of procedure, after which the com
mittee on platform and resolutions filed

SANTA CRITZ, Aug. 24.â James C.
Needham of Stanislaus was renomt
nated this afternoon to represent for a
fourth term the Sixth District in the
lower house of Congress. Prior to hW

Shortly after 2 o'clock E. S. Mitchell
of Fresno, chairman of the Congres
sional committee of the Â«Ustric^ called
the convention to order. After briefly
stating the purpose of the convention
he called for nominations for chairman.
W. J. Hill, editor of the Salinas Index,
was unanimously selected. Upon as
suming the chair he made a speeca
upon the issues of the campaign, thor
oughly arousing the enthusiasm of tne
convention- H. S. Wanzer of Santa

â¢ .The State Convention will be called
â¢to order in the beautifully decorated
Casino upon the beach, the pride of
'New Santa Cruz, at 2 o'clock p. m.
to-morrow. General Stone, as chair
man of tt*; State Committee, will not
taU long, but he will have something
pointed to say to his fellow Republic
ans. XJ. s. Grant of San Diego for
elector is acceptable all around.
The fight for the Congressional nom
ination in the Eighth is engaging a
oVal of attention. S. C. Smith of Kern
is confident of success, and equal con
fidence is manifested by M. L. Ward of
San Diego. The convention will consist
of 102 delegates and the representation
will be very large.
The outcome of these differences may
be the selection of ten good and true
Republicans of eminence without spe
cial refrence to Congressional district
boundaries. Judge Svreeney of Shasta
has many supporters In the First Dis
trict. It was given out to-night that
J. O. Hayes of San Jose will not ac
â¢crpt a place upon the electorial ticket.
This signifies to the politicians that
Z. A. Hayes will take the nomination
for Congress in the Fifth District.
In the First District there is a strong
opposition to giving Humboldt the Con
gressman and elector. In the Sixth
District Fresno is not inclined to yield
Harris' claims to those of West of San
Joaquln. The name of Walker of Long
Beach, handed in from the Seventh
District by Walter Parker, may not be
acceptable to a majority of the 730 del
egates comprising the convention.
â¢ 'SANTA CRUZ, ilufr. 24.â The truth
.may be again demonstrated In signifi
cant style that a Republican conven
â¢tion will not take a raw programme
with the complaisance that marks the
reception of a slate in the Democrat^
councils of California. There has been

yards. , . . .
The firm, since the commencement
of the strike, has housed .about 200
men and women in its oleomargarine
building and to-night there were
ninety women and fifty men in the
place when a flre started in the clothes
closet on the fourth floor. The cries
of those on the fourth floor as they ran
for the stairways brought out the oc
cupants of the other floors and for a
few minutes there was fierce fighting
in the hallways leading to the stairs.
Finally it was seen by the occupants
of the upper, floor that the fire would
amount to nothing and they turned
back and allowed those already on the
stairs to reach the street.

PARIS, Aug. 24. â There is reason to
believe that a decision Is about to be
taken providing for the voluntary dis
armament of the Russian cruiser Ask
old and the torpedo-boat destroyer
Grozovoi, now at Shanghai, and the
Russian cruiser Diana at Saigon. This
will be done primarily to avoid inter
national complications and will have
the effect of reducing the Russian
strength by three strong units, but the
Russian authorities consider that this
will be offset by the avoidance of the
possible capture of the vessels by the
Japanese.
Advices received here from Saigon
show, contrary to previous announce
ments, that the Diana is in a very
bad condition. She has one large hole
in her hull below the water line.
Russia Will Lose Services of the Di
ana, the AÂ«kohi and the Grozovoi.

CHICAGO, Aug. 24.â Within a period
of four weeks Joseph Leiter, million
aire, and a member of one of the oldest
and best known families in Chicago,
haa succeeded in opening up and ope
rating his mines at Zelgler, 111., night
and day with a full complement of
men and the usual output, in defiance
of an armed body of 400 strikers.
To accomplish this, Leiter has given
much of his time to the little mining
town. In navy blue shirt and overalls,
Leiter personally patrolled the plant
and directed defenses against any pos
sible attacks from the striking miners,
who were camped in tents outside the
town.
For weeks the town was in a state of
siege and the little garrison of deputy
United States Marshals and non-union
employes that Leiter has taken into
the town knew not at what moment,
day or night, some organized attack
might be made upon their defenses.

humanity by a lusty yell, which echoed
through the chapel and was greeted by
a murmur of amusement and approval
as being a sign of luck and good au

The Te D?tim, melodiously chanted
by a hidden choir, was the signal to
the bells overhead, which swung clam
orously, while from the royal yacht, off
the shore of the gulf, thundered a sal
ute of 301 guns. The signal was taken
up at Krorst^xjt and St. Petersburg

As the message sped forth from the
fort to the town the Emperor entered

About half past 10 last night word
came to Connor that a man was fight
ing with a woman behind locked doors
at the Astoria. On arriving there he
heard sounds of a scuffle and told the
landlady, Mrs. Clark, to open the door.
The officer entered and caught hold of
the man. As he 'did so Saulters turn
ed and fired at him. Connor dodged
and grappled with the man, while the
woman dropped to the floor. In re
sponse to Connor's whistle Policeman
J. F. Lycett arrived. The Injured
woman was sent to the Central Emer
gency Hospital, where it was found
that she was seriously but not fatally
hurt. Saulters was bundled into a pa
trol wagon, but not before making a
desperate resistance on â¢the street. He
was clubbed into submission and
handcuffed.
Saulters came here a few months
ago from Old Mexico, where he had
been employed as a telegrapher. He
lived at 111 Grchu avenue for some
months and there became acquainted
with Miss Mays. His peculiar actions
caused the landlady tt> eject him and
since that time he has been living on
Fourth street. He was arrested be
fore on Tuesday night t>y Connor for
being drunk and disorderly in the
woman's apartments. He is held at
the Cit" Prison on a charge of assault
with a deadly weapon and Detective
Ryan is working on the case. The
woman's statement at the hospital
substantially agrees with that of Po
liceman Connor.
That Policeman Robert Connor Is
still alive is owing to his quickness
and a large share of good luck. In at
tempting to arrest John C. Saulters
last night at the Astoria, 111 Grant
avenue, the man fired a revolver at
him. Connor dodged just in time and
the bullet passed through the shoul

Important' particular from the manner
of the Eastern ' productions. In the
East natives of Greece were trained for
the dramatis Â«personae, here students
will take part in the play. This will
have been the first time that students
in America have attempted to play
"Ajax," the only other instance in
which students were, employed being
at Cambridge University in 1882.
The play will not be produced In the
original Greek language. It- has been
found that the modern, language i3
adapted more to the singing parts than
the old, and it has been used with suc
cess in the Eastern productions.
Training for the play will begin at
once, with Alisa Barrows as instructor,
and by. October it is hoped that
"Ajax" will be ready for the stage.
Miss Barrows has come to Berkeley
with her mother, Mrs. Elizabeth C.
Barrows, who is herself a writer and
critic of unusual talents. MJss Bar
rows has been interested in the dram
atization of classsic dramas since her
high school days. She has dramatized
various episodes in' the Aeneid and
the Odyssey. She only lately returned
front Europe, where she spent a large
part of her time studying old Greek
vases for the costuming and dances of
the ancients, so that the representa
tions in America may be faithful
copies in at least one respect.
BERKELEY, Aug. 24.â A love for
the classic drama of the ancients and

Sophocles' famous work, in the Greek
language at the Greek open air theater

out the dictates of her tastes and tal

months of incessant work. For re

ALAMEDA, Aug. 24.â The Alameda
Advancement Association had a meet-
Ing with various city officials last even
ing in regard to the demands of the
city with relation to the proposed tax
levy, which will shortly have to be
fixed. The meeting was executive, no
one being present except the citv offi
cials and the directors of the associa
tion, and nothing of the proceedings
was given cut until to-day, when the
association made public an official sum
mary of what happened. . . -.Â».
From this it would seem that there Is
a general demand upon the Town Trus
tees for an increase in the tax allow
ance for all departments, and it is a
question whose demands will be recog
nized by the Trustees.
There were present of the association
directors George W. Scott, Philip S,
Teller, E. R. Anthony, Charles S. Neal
and Elmer E. Johnson; also Secretary
Brown. Of the Trustees all were pres
ent except Mr. Hammond, who is out of
town. Representing the Board. of Edu
ction there were Presidents Otis, Henry
Michaels and Dr. Thompson, principal
of the High School, who had been in
vited: also Superintendent Moore. E.
W. Maslin represented the Free Li
brary Board.
A summary of the reports upon the
condition of the city, made by the city
officials to the Advancement Associa
tion, is as follows:
President Otis of the Board of Education
reported that the High School would need
?17.024 this year, which would be more than
last year because" of the need of another
teacher. books and gymnasium apparatus.
Principal Thompson of the High School said
that the needs of his school for reference
tooks. apparatus for laboratory work and
gymnasium work were very great. Mr.- Otl?
lepcrted that there is now a deficit of $4385
in the grammar school fund because of .a cut
of ?400O made last year, that the city would
have to supply 927,770 this year and that no
salaries would be raised except In the case of
s<. me few principals and male teachers In
order to retain their services.
Dr. Pond of the electric light â¢ committee of
the Board of Trustees read a report showing
what betterments were needÂ«?d by the municipal
electric lighting plant. President Scott of the
association wanted to know if by economizing
ca the other departments the electric lighting
plant could not 'be run and the betterments
made next year. This, the Trustees thought,
might be done.
The official statement of the associa
tion concludes with the following,
which covers the apparent feeling of
the associationiupon lhe - present finan
cial condition of Alameda:
' During thÂ« discussion it developed that the
tax levy last year was â¢ but 88 cents, which
was 14 cent* short -of the. dollar limit, and
that the dollar - limit. ,would. be, reached this
year If the requirements of the various de
partments'were, properly met.' ' ; -.
1 An Â¦Â¦ interesting point was the attitude of
the City . Truetfea on . the , proposed r^ise , .of
wages of certain employes, which, according
to Trustee Bowers, would add about 3*4 cents
to Â¦ the -tax "levy. [ The' discussion seemed In
clined to oppos* the raise,- they all -teemed- to
think it was impossible to give the school
department air that It required.
It appeared that no case had been known
of a policeman or fire- department employe or
electric light employe resigning because of
Insufficient pay, and yet the school -department
xvas unable to keep high-class teachers be
cause the pay was lower than they could get
elsewhere.
Mr. Scott asked this question:
"Taking Into consideration the condition you
are In this year, a condition which you say.
of greater necessities than ever before, would
you consider advisable the raising of the
salaries of employes that 95000 as proposed?
Would you not consider it -a better Investment
to give the school department what It needs
and save on the other?"
In answer to this pointed question not one
cf the Trustees seemed willing to commit him
self. Â»So far as any response wag made to
the question It was to the effect that they did
not see how they could give the school de
partment what was asked for and did not
ree how they could avoid giving the city
employes the raise which they asked for.

Silk culture in California never has
been profitable and can never be made
profitable, because labor costs more
here than It does . in other countries
where the silk industry la conducted
with profit. . :
This is the secret of the failure of so
many attempts to establish silk culture
in California. The climate is good
enough, the worms thrive, on It and
grow fat, but it costs so much to un
wind what they spin into a cocoon that
there is no money in it for the grower.
The failure of silk culture as a profit
able industry is explained in this way
by Professor C. W. Woodworth. pro
fessor of entomology at the University
of California, in a bulletin issued at
the university to-day. The high cost
of labor, he finds,, does not apply so
much to the actual rearing of the
worms as to the manufacturing pro
cess, called reeling, by which the silk
is taken from the cocoons . and made
into the product known as raw silk.
"There would be no difficulty in ob
taining skilled Orientals." Professor
Woodworth says, "but they would de
mand higher wages than la their na
tive land for the same work. This
difference must be taken from, the price
that is paid for cocoons, sine* raw silk
is imported duty free. I
"Many people have gone into silk
raising -with exaggerated ideas as to
the profits of the business, when as a
matter of fact one cannot expect fair
wages for his work. Under favorable
conditions one could expect to obtain
about a hundred pounds of fresh co
coons, or perhaps thirty-three pounds
dried ready for shipment from an
ounce of eggs. These are worth be
tween $25 or $30. One person cannot ex
pect to care for more than two ounces
of eggs. This would Squire six weeks'
work and after deducting the cost of
the. plant there is little left for waces."
Professor Woodworth adds that his
department Is experimenting with silk
culture In a small way in the hope that
the labor Item might in some manner
be reduced enough to make the Indus
try profitable, but -with no prospect of
Immediate results.

as William Dean Howells, William
Winters and William Archer as one of
the strongest examples of dramatic lit
erature of the past decade. Those who
have seen Florence Roberts as Sapho
and Zaza and imagine they have
gauged her powers will be astounded
by the revelation of her tragic genius
in "Tess."
The largest advance sale of seats for
any theatrical attraction that has
played in this city at dollar prices is
the record for the first day's sale for
the Florence Roberts engagement at
the California Theater. All day yester
day there was a" long line of ticket
buyers constantly in front of the Cal
ifornia ticket office and up to closing
time last night the demand was Just
as great as during the earlier hours
of the day. Such a tremendous sale
at this season of the year is regarded
by local experts as being truly phe
nomenal and attests more than columns
of newspaper space to the wonderful
popularity of this distinguished actress
In her home city.

SAN JOSE. Aug. 24. â Bessie Bar
clay, the sixteen-year-old girl from
Los Angeles who has a penchant for
wearing the garb of a boy, has been
released from the "City Prison. She
has been taken into the home of Nat
Weinberg. the Humane Societv officer.
The girl is the adopted daughter of
Judge Barclay of Los Angeles. She
came here three weeks aÂ«jo and went
to work in a North First street no
tion store. Wishing to masquerade as
a boy, she took a number of nieces or
boys* clothing from the store, and as
these were found in her room she was
arrested. The ov.-ner of the store re
fused to prosecute, however, and her
foster parents in Los Angeles were
notified of her whereabouts. Her
adopted father states that he sent heÂ»
here to work in the fruit houses and
he was unable to render her any fur*
ther assistance. Weinberg' . has now
taken the girl with the hope of re
forming her.

Lieutenant Colonel W. de St. Paul

asmuch as there had been some objec
tion made. It had been decided to drop
the vroni '"prominent" In connection
Â¦with the tltJe of the committee, which
henceforth shall be known as the Citi
zens' Reception Committee.
. Colonel Heap. U. S. A., suggested
that since the War Department would
probably offer no objection, the visiting
KjJffhts might be shown over San
jrancisco's great fortifloatlons, Â¦which
he considered unsurpassed in the
United States. The colonel further
projnised that he Trou'd act as an es
cort to the party.
. While the various committees of the
Knights T>eniplar are rnaJnng: prepara
tions the citizens will not be far be
hind In hospitality. The Citizens' Re
ception Committee for the Knights
Templar conclave met yesterday in tha
Maple room of the Palace Hotel. A.
" S.barboro presided.
On Sunday the Bossotos found on
their door the ''bridge of death," a
cabalistic sign of the Sicilians which
is said to be a threat of death. The
elder Bossoto looked upon this as a
joke at the time.
At the police station Rossati said lit
tle beyond declaring he shot in self
defense.
Early to-day Rossati entered the
r^Ftaurant and when approached by
the elder Bossoto Faid he wanted noth
ing. As Bossoto was about to close
the place, he asked Rossati to leave.
The latter became insolent and refused.
Younjj Bossoto, who was in the
kitchen, heard 1iis father and the man
in an argument and came out. Up to
this time the man had made no dem
onstration of violence, but the instant
he saw young Bossoto he took a pistol
from his pocket, leveled it at the youth
and fired. The bullet struck the boy
between the eyes and he fell dead. Ros
sati then, according to the police,
struck the elder Bossoto with his fist,
knocking him down, and started to run,
but was captured before he had gone
two blocks.
Bossoto is an enemy of these organ
ized ganjrs and his son inherited the
fathers opposition to the lawless ele
ment of their countrymen. When not
studying music young Bossoto helped
about the restaurant. Several weeks
asro he learned that the murderous
gang about Mulberry Bend had planned
to rob and murder a number of miners
who were cominjf through New York
and who had engaged board in the
lodffinR-house over the Boysoto restau
rant. Young Bossoto went to the po
lice and asked for protection for the
men and a detective arrested twelve
suspicious characters, who were held
until the miners had taken a ship for
their homes. Once out of jail, it is
said, the gang determined upon Bos
soto's death.
NEW YORK. Aug. 24.â SaJvator Bos
soto, 18 years old. was shot to death
at his 'ather's restaurant in Park
street by Carlo Rossati. 35 years old,
to-day, because he had disclosed to
the police secrets of the alleged "black
hand." The father was knocked down
and choked into insensibility by the
slayer, who then ran down thÂ£ street,
followed by a great mob. Italians to
the number of 1000 later attacked the
Elizabeth-street police station, iiurled
missiles at the police and prisoner,
hurting two detectives and one police
man. They would have torn the mur
derer Hmb from limb had it not been
for the arrival of the reserve police
from two station houses, who were
forced to use clubs and fists and
threaten to shoot.
According to the police, the murder
was deliberately planned by an organ
ized gang, which is alleged to have
sent to Torrento for Rossati, who ar
rived here last night. After his arrival
he -was seen about Mulberry Bend
with Italians and because of his im
mense stature attracted attention.
Nos. 1 and 7 started at 9 o'clock
to-night. The Cuthbert house party
special from Canada followed at Ash
Fork and all other westbound trains
were on their way by midnight. The
Santa Fe officials were arranging to
transfer their trains from Ash Fork
to the Maricopa and Phoenix road via
Prescott and thence to Los Angeles on
the Southern Pacific. Considerable
damage by washouts near Maricopa,
however, put that road in bad condition
and trains could not be handled safely.
SELIGMAN. Ariz., Aug. 24.â During
a heavy storm to-day a cloudburst oc
curred in the mountains, which caused
all streams in the locality to become
greatly swollen.
To-night a large volume of water is
coming through Crozier Canyon. Much
damage has already been done and the
Santa Fe Railroad Company, which has
been working night and day to repair
the damage done by the recent rains,
is practically out of business. About
300 feet of track has been washed out
at Crozier. The new abutment and
bridge at that point have been removed
by the rushing water. Telegraph poles
and wires, have been wrecked and
water is running over the company's
roadbed at Crozier. The railroad offi
cials have announced that all the de
layed westbound trains will go east
at once by way of Albuquerque and
Deming, N. M.. and detour west over
the Southern Pacific tracks to Cali
fornia.
The problem of the day consisted of
a blue force arriving at Asuncion sta
tion with the intention of attacking
an inferior brown force, which was said
to be holding the Graves Creek road
to the south. The brown force, en
camped at Paradise Springs, having
been informed by scouts of the arrival
of the blues, moved up to Needle Gorge
and attempted to stop the progress of
the blues at that point. Colonel Mark
ley was in command of the blues and
Colonel Ward commanded the browns.
The blues pushed forward under
forced marches. The cavalry and ar
tillery succeeded in gaining a position
commanding the mountains and the
blue infantry dashed into the defile.
In the meantime cannonading was be
ing carried on- from the tops of the
mountains by the contending forces,
the brown artillery having climbed
an adjacent hill. The result so far as
the casual observer could note was vic
tory for the browns. What the um
pires may say about it may be an
other matter.
General MacArthur and staff will
leave far San Francisco on Saturday.
A span of spirited horses ran away
to-day and made straight for the big
camp. They dashed about at full
speed among the hundreds of tents. In
hot pursuit of them was a Mexican on
a polo pony and one of the colored
troopers c-n a saddleless steed. The
chase lasted for half an hour and
threw the whole camp into a state of
great excitement. The team finally
ran into a small tent, and tent, horses
and all came down with a crash. One
of the horses managed to clear himself
ahd ran toward Colonel Pitcher's pro
visional headquarters, where the col
c-red trooper caught him. Nearly 1000
soldiers took a hand in trying to stop
the terrified animals.
Following is a roster of the troops in
camp here to-night:
Division headquarters, 220; First
Bripade. 1710; Second Brigade, 1716;
divisional cavalry, 331; divisional ar
tillery, 285; divisional field hospital,
108, and divisional signal corps, 118, a
totnl of 4488, as against 4548 on Au
gust 14.
When Governor Pardee was shown
these figures he expressed himself as
highly gratified with the splendid
showing of the militia an$ compli
mented them highly for the good work
they had done here, reports of which
he had received from General MacAr
thur and other officers.
CAMP -ATASCADERO. Aug. 24.â
Governor Pardee arrived in camp to
day. His reception was warm when
he got here, but for a time it looked as
though he was going to be allowed to
find his own way out to camp. It was
thought here that the Governor and
party intended getting off the train at
Paso- Robles and Colonel Joselyn, rep
resenting General MacArthur, and Gen
eral Lauck, representing the State ml
litla, took an automobile and went
there. The Governor arrived at Paso
Robles and. seeing no one to meet him
and his party, Â¦ he again boarded the
train and proceeded up to Asuncion
station. To his amazement there was
no one at this point to greet him. In
the meantime the train pulled out, leav
ing the gubernatorial party on the lit
tle temporary platform. Finally the
news of the Governor's predicament
reached camp and Captain F. L. Winn
took the signal service corps auto
mobile and drove full speed for Asun
cion. After an hour's delay the Gov
ernor reached camp. He was accom
panied by Mrs. Pardee. Colonel and
Mre. E. F. Beck, Lieutenant Colonel
Robert Weineeke and Colonel H. T.
Sime. Lieutenant Colonel F. W. Chap
man came up from Los Angeles and
Joined the party here.
After a short visit in camp Mrs. Par
dee and Colonel and Mrs. Beck left
Paso Rcbles in an automobile. The
Governor and the others who are mem
bers of his staff will remain here over
night. He will leave to-morrow night
at midnight for Long Eeach, returning
north early next week.
Problem No. S, the last of the series
of maneuvers, took place to-day. The
troops were under arms shortly after
sunrise. The exercise was called the
passage of a defile. It was full of in
terest and instruction to the troops
taking part and of a highly spectacu
lar nature. Hundreds of people who
followed the troops for miles were well
rewarded for their trouble, for the troops
did fine work all through the day. Very
few of the men dropped out. The um
pires were lavish in their praise of the
collective and individual work of the
soldiers. The militia showed great im
provement over their work in the first
exercise. \
State Correspondent of The Call.
BY F. M.-*G1I*MORE,
PORTLAND, Aug. 24.â The 1905 ses
sion of the American Mining: Congress
will- be held at El Paso if the board of
directors is gruided in its decision by
the voice of the delegates and members
present at the seventh annual session,
as they doubtless will be. The resolu
tion introduced by T. A. Rickard, editor
of the Mining and Engineering Journal,
favoring that city as the place of the
next convention was adopted this after
noon by unanimous vote.
By far the most important matter of
the day was the somewhat acrimonlus
argument that preceded the adoption
of a resolution introduced by P. H.
Steele of Alaska indorsing the efforts
of the citizens of that territory to se
cure a delegation in Congress. The
resolution came back from the commit
.tee with the recommendation that it be
not adopted.
Dr. Buckley, chairman of the resolu
tions committee, precipitated the dis
cussion by his explanation of the com
mittee's adverse report that it was the
sense of the committee that no resolu
tions of a political nature be reported
favorably.
The subject engendered considerable
feeling before it was finally disposed of.
The contest of the congress will be
gin to-morrow over the selection of
permanent headquarters. The first or
der of business will be the report of
the credentials committee, which will
show that 1003 persons are eligible to
participation in the proceedings and
may vote in accordance with the rules
of the organization.
"While there is some disposition to
postpone the \ selection of , permanent
headquarters for another year, the ma
jority is apparently firm- in the con
viction that the time has arrived when
the congress should cease to be a mi
gratory institution and that it should
henceforth maintain a permanent es
tablishment for the benefit of those en
gaged in the different branches of the
mining industry. .
Resolutions will be reported, includ
ing one requesting Legislatures of the
mining States to enact laws requiring
mining engineers to pass technical ex
aminations and secure license to prac
tice their profession.
A reception was tendered the dele
gates and visitors to-night by the citi
zens of Portland.
Late to-night it was announced that
proxies held by delegates to the Amer
ican Mining Congress cannot be voted
and that delegates not regularly elect
ed members of the congress will not be
allowecTto vote with the members, thus
preventing cities seeking the perma
nent headquarters of the congress from
voting large numbers of proxies and
delegates sent here for the purpose of
swelling their votes in the fight for the
greatest gifts in the hands of the con
gress.
President Richards has named as
members of the committee to nominate
nine members of the board of directors
Thomas Ewing of California. G. W.
Doraey of Nebraska. Z. L. Cobb of
Texas, John Dem of Utah and James
F. Callbreath of Colorado.

been but few heavy wagers made up
lo the present time on the Jeffrles-
Munroe fight. A number of bets of
tlVQ to 540 on Jeffries have been laid,

"Frankie" Dwyer has 52000 to bet
that Munroe will go ten rounds. He
tvants 52400 against his money.
* George Considine will wait until the
right of the fight to place his money.
Charles K. Harris, the composer of

rocney be placed on Munroe at 1 to 2
01 better. Jim Wakeley and Clem

suming the lead early in the race, she
rapidly increased the distance between
herself and her competitors and
crossed the line at 4:25 o'clock, just
five minutes ahead of the time limit

every sail set; she was greeted with
round after round of enthusiastic

PORTLAND. Or.. Au ff . 24.â Th. results at
Irvlngton to-day were:
The big fellow arose early yester
day and soon after breakfast pro
ceeded to the Reliance Club to begin
tne work of the day. After limber
ing up with the weights and wrist ma
chine Jeffries skipped the rope for
tl'irty minutes. Then, with a pair of
light dumbells in his hands, he went
tÂ»t shadow boxing. For more than
half an hour the champion fought an
Imaginary Munroe all over the "gym."
The footwork he displayed was a sur
prise to a number of his friends, who
had gathered at the club to get a line
on .the big fellow before the fight.
At the end of nearly two hours of
hard, fast work, the champion ap
j/Â«-ared as fresh as if he had just
started in. If condition is to be a fac
tor in the big contest Jeffries will
?save no chance to make any excuse
c!i that score If he loses. If ever &
fighter was in good shape for a battle
that man is Jeffries. His skin shows
the clear, healthy glow of the perfect
ly conditioned athlete and the play of
bis muscles as he goes through his
vork shows the effect of his long
j'Tf-paration.
After luncheon with a number of
his friends the big fellow rested for a
couple of hours and then the party
started for Lake Merritt. Selecting
the heaviest boat he could find, Jeff
j:es told three of his friends to "pile
In," and, taking the oars, the cham
pion sent that boat through the water
at a swift space. For more than an
hour the champion stuck to the oars
and at the end of that time, although
he was streaming with perspiration,
Jeffries* breathing was as regular as if
tome one else had been doing the
rowing. A run to the club and a bath
end rubdown finished the work for
the day.
He will now do only Just enough
verk to keep himself on edge until
he steps into the ring to-morrow night
to defend his title.
With his work in the Reliance Club
gymnasium yesterday Champion James
J. Jeffries finished his hard training
toy his battle with Jack Munroe.
Friends of the Champion Are De
lighted at His Form.

PITCHER OWEN FORCES
IX THE WINNING RUN
It was decided to have two pairs of
Eloves at the ringside for each man.
This was done in view of the accident
tu one of Jeffries' gloves during the
Ccrbett tight, when the glove broke.
The articles of agreement call for
â¢oft bandages, which the fighters will
X'iit on in their dressing-rooms. When
they enter the ring the referee will
decide whether they are in accordance
the articles of agreement and his
vord will be final.
Munroe seems the most uncon
cerned man about the training camp
at the beach. He gives no thought,
apparently, to the fight and is not
peevish nor fretful, as most athletes
<irf on the eve of a struggle. He went
en the road yesterday morning and
tÂ«-ck a stroll along the beach in the
afternoon. He also indulged in several
fe.snies of cards to pass the time.
When he stopped his heavy training
liÂ» weighed about 210 pounds. It Is
Â«*xpected he will weigh at least 220
jmundti when he enters the ring. Jef
fries will weigh fully 240 pounds to
n.rirrow night, which will make the
jnest formidable human fighting ma
chine that ever entered a ring.
The betting is still 3% to 10. But
lii tie money is being wagered, each
eide holding out for better odds.
"That means," said Graney, "that
the* crowd can yell "Break!' tiU their
voices quit on them, but the referee
does not have to do any football
vw'k."
Kid McCoy and Harry Pollok were
1 resent in the interests of Munroe,
While Billy Gallagher was delegated to
represent Jeffries. Billy Delaney being
unable to be present. Eddie Graney
xi.ade the j:lea that as he was not
strong it would not be right to expect
bun to try to break the big fellows
cut of a clinch. McCoy said Munroe
vas prepared to protect himself at all
tane*. both in the clinches and in the
breakaways. Gallagher quickly saw
that Jeffries was, if anything, getting
lh<* better of the bargain, and said
that arrangement suited Jeffries.
As thÂ» rerult of the conference with
Itcferee Kddio Graney last night at
Kfirry Corbett's, Jeffries and Munroe
hikVc agreed, through their representa
tives, to protect themselves to-morrow
j;iÂ£ht iii the breakaways and in the
clinches to break at the order of the
referee.

and won the last three heats after the
first had been captured by George G

the favorite. Every condition for the
big race was perfect. Dr. Strong was
an almost even favorite against the

SACRAMENTO, Aug. 24. â An in
crease In the attendance at the State
Fair races was noticeable to-day, but
the batting ring showed little activity.
With two harness events and three run
ning races, all one sided, there was lit
tle of the sport over which to enthuse.
The bettors are slow to return to the
old style of betting in the auction and
mutuel boxes on the runners, and thero
is still talk of an attempt being made
to reinstate the books. Some of the di
rectors favor taking this action, but a
majority of them are opposed to turn-
Ing over the betting to the syndicate.
In the final race, Theodore L ran
away after finishing last in the six fur
long race. Westley. who had the mount,
fell off after the filly had run two miles
and was badly shaken up. His stirrups
broke and he had no control of his
mount.
The day opened with a trot for tho
2:19 class, in which Coronado and Lady
Madison sold for $10 each and the field,
made up of Little Babe, McPherson and
H D B, $3. Coronado won In straight
heats, Durfee driving in great form. In
the second heat Lady Madison, coming
fast on the outside, made a bid for the
heat, but was beaten a neck. For the
final heat, Coronado was made favorite
at 10 to 5 for the field and easily gath
ered in the coin.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
"There ain't no Greeks in the base
ball business," remarked the striking
mascot- Sheehan lined one at Bar

the college twirler reached third.
The two tried the double steal. "Ob
serve the strategy," cried the co-ed

hasten homeward now."
Gorton threw to Miller, who dropped
the ball. The sphere tumbled into
Gochnauer's ready mitt. He zinged it
to Gorton, nailing Overall a yard from
the rubber.
"Dere's many a slip 'twlxt de keg and

"And Mr. Overall was such an ex
ceedingly promising trigonometry stu
dent," remarked the co-ed. "Let us
leave this unclassical atmosphere."

SARATOGA. Aug. 24.â Surprise was
expressed at the small field which ran
In the SSOOO Adirondack stakes, the
feature of the day racing, but it is only
in accordance with precedent. No mat
ter how valuable the prize may be, it,
is almost impossible to guarantee a
large or a classy field with the Futurity
so close at hand.
There were only four starters in the
Adirondack, with S. S. Brown's Broad
cloth the well-played favorite. Opposed
to him were Sparkling Star, Pasadena
and Blue Coat. Pasadena went to the
post with a large piece of cotton bat
ting stuffed in his off hind leg just
below the hock, where he was cut down
last Saturday.
Sparkling Star ran a fair race until
the turn was reached. B,roadcloth here
moved up and Sparkling Star was shut
out. After that he failed to show any
speed. Broadcloth wo,n by several
lengths, while Pasadena, which was
last for half a mile, earned second
money because the pacemaker, Blue.
Coat, retired. The winner wasmadethe
medium of a heavy plunge on the part
of John A. Drake. John W. Gates also
backed Broadcloth. Summary:

Special Dljpatch to The Call,
CHICAGO, Aug. 24. â "Pa" Brad
ley's nily. Allie Virgie, furnished an
amusing incident in the first race to
day at Hawthorne. Just as the field
left the barrier the mare unseated
Jockey Larsen. This did not discon
cert her and she went along with her
field. Cyprienne, the well-played fa
vorite, set the pace, with the riderless
Allie Virgie, well up, in second place.
Turning for home Cyprienne led by
live lengths. As the final eighth pole
was reached Allie Virgie began to
make her run. The crowd in the
grand stand cheered her on, and,
buoyed up by the applause, she gained
inch by inch, just as thoroughbreds do
at times when Jockeys are using whip
and spurs.
Twenty yards from the wire Allie
Virgie joined Cyprienne. For a mo
ment Aubuchon began to ride his
mount, not knowing the horse about
to beat him was riderless. Amid cheers
equal to that given any Derby winner,
Allie Virgie crossed the line first by
a neck. Cyprienne was, of course,
placed first, as Allie Virgia did not
have up her allotted weight.
An unprecedented incident occurred
in the fifth race when a horse that
finished outside the money was dis
qualified for a foul. San Remo, which
finished second to Exclamation, was
set back and Apple placed second.
Langford James finished fourth, but
was disqualified with San Remo and
the show money given to Farmer Jim,
which was a furlong behind the win
ner at the finish. Summary:

DEFENDER OF THE FLAG
BATTLES WITH HIMSELF
Surgeons Wonder Whether Corporal
Blair Sought Entertainment or At
tempted to Commit Suicide.
Corporal Douglas Blair, Company F,
Twenty-eighth Infantry, shot himself
three times through his shoulders at
the Presidio Tuesday afternoon. It is
not quite clear whether he wished to
mutilate himself or to commit suicide.
His condition is somewhat serious, al
though the army surgeons stated yes
terday that his wounds were not nec
efsarliy fatal.
Blair used a 38-caliber revolver for
his target practice. He was alone in
his quarters at the time of the shoot
ing. Two bullet3 were sent into his
left shoulder and one into his right.
The wounded man was immediately
removed to the hospital and placed
upon the operating table. Two bullets
were located and extracted without
difficulty. The third piece of lead
could not be found even with the use
of the X-ray, but another attempt to
get it will be made this morning.
Blair refuses to satisfy the curiosity
of the hospital people as to why he
shot himself, but maintains a sphinx
like silence. Army officers have a
persuasive way with them, however,
and If the wounded soldier pulls
through all right he will undoubtedly
reconsider his determination not to ex
plain. His comrades allege that he has
been drinking.

Accepts Bid for Paving of
Thoroughfare From Sev
enth to Twentieth Avenue
The Board of Public Works yester
day decided that as soon as the
Knights Templar Conclave and con
vention of Odd Fellows are over
it will recommend to the Board of Su
pervisors that an ordinance be passed
prohibiting an'y suspended street dec
orations that may be dangerous to
public safety and human lives. Action
was taken as the result of a complaint
from M. H. de Young relative to the
framework for illuminations which is
being partly suspended from his build
ing at the intersection of Market, Third
and Kearny Â» streets.
John J. Deane appeared for De
Young and while not wishing to inter
fere with the celebration, said he
would not assume any responsibility,
as the cables were inadequate to sup
port the immense iron ring suspended
therefrom. M. Haveside, who is con
structing the framework, informed the
board that he would assume all re
sponsibility in the matter and to make
the suspension more secure would add
another cable to those now being used.
Engineer Miller stated that with the
changes the decorations would be per
fectly safe.
Commissioner Casey said the sain-?
trouble had occurred during the re
cent G. A. 11. celebration owing to 'he
original plans and specifications hav
ing not been complied with. Casey's
motion that the prohibitory ordinance
be recommended then prevailed.
The board granted a permit to the
1'ost-f.tieet Improvement Club for the
decoration' of Post street, from Mont
gomery to Powell, and also a permit
to the Knights Templar executive
committee to paint the poles on Mar
ket street at its own expense.
The resolution appointing Richard
L. Nolan, at present a civil service
bricklayer, as assistant superintendent
of sewers at the same salary was de
ferred one week.
Bids were opened for the paving
with asphalt of H street, from Seventh
to Twentieth avenue. The bids were
from the City Street Improvement
Company at $32. $34 40; Barber As
phalt Company at $32,228 23, and F.
M. Yorke at $29,150 55. F. M. Yorke
being the lowest bidder was awarded
the contract.
The City Architect was instructed to
prepare plans for a fire engine house
on Twentieth street, between Missou
ri and Connecticut, an appropriation
therefor having been made in the
budget.
The board denied the petition of
George Tardi to lay a wooden sidewalk
in front of 731 Union street.
The Bureau of Streets was request
ed to report on alleged obstructions at
the corner of Pixley avenue and
Steiner street.
Charges of alleged dereliction of
duty were ordered filed with the Civil
Service Commission against C. Mea
gher, paver, and J. Catania, janitor.
G. W. Cushing. who submitted a bid
on August 17 for grading and macad
amizing Nineteenth avenue, from Tro
cadero road to Ocean avenue, was
awarded the contract at S4115 56.

become epic. He says:
"Only once did I see his temper get

the fall. The last beef round-up had
reached Chimney Buttes, a mile south
of the Maltese Cross ranch. A driving
rain that froze as it fell turned the
whole river Dottom, where the camp
was made, into a sea- of half- frozen
mud. The cattle were restless and
hard to hold. All hands were called
out and the nervous beasts were finally
rounded up under the shelter of the
bluffs. THe cook's fire had long been
drowned out and all hands went sup

Some interesting reminiscences of ths

Senator Fairbanks was there as a stu
dent. He tells of one occasion when a
contest had been arranged between twa
rival literary societies. On the night
of the affair, instead of a genuine con
test, a "mock programme" made it*
appearance, and in consequence thÂ«
faculty suspended two prominent up
per classmen. A students' meeting
was called, and Fairbanks, '72, made a
stirring speech, criticizing the faculty'*
action as an infraction of the rights
of American citizenship. The next day
there was a special meeting of the fac
ulty and young Fairbanks was sum
moned and required to repeat his
speech of the night before. The" faculty
then entered into a heated discussion
of the matter. A number of the morÂ»
up-to-date professors supported Fair
banks In his views, with the result that
the two suspended men were reinstated.
After that the name of Fairbanks was
on every tongue and he became thÂ»

them, and some didn't, at the Judge's idea of what is an honor.
Bat with this passage of politeness and sentiment the billing and cooing
between the fir.st and second choice of the Presidency seems to have ended.
Mr. Hearst has written editorials on manners and morals, the mechanism of
society, and has indted Ella Wheeler Wilcox to write "Granny Woman" ar
ticles on stirpiculrure, going into entirely unnecessary details that belong in
the private pages of medical practice, but he has been very r-eserved in his
references to the man of Esopus. He may admire him, but shows great self
restraint ia concealing his feelings.
Mr. Hearst, however, must have an affinity. It is necessary in his busi
ness, and he seems to have found one in Watson, the gaunt and dyspeptic
Georgian, who perhaps owes his pessimistic politics to the Southern hot
bread and fxyingpan. The bond of union between them is their intense ha
tred of Mr. Cleveland. If they had their way the ex-President would never
get a bite, and if they could do it by absent treatment they would saw his
boat. Anyway, Hearst is helping Watson, with a view of increasing the
Populist vote, in order to make an argument for fusion in 1908, when Hearst
hopes for the Presidential nomination as a dividend on his large and losing
investment of 1904.
Watson is going into the campaign in the close States to express his
and Hearst's opinion of Judge Parker. Mr. Hearst might do this himself,
but his method in politics is to hire a megaphone, and so he employs Wat
son. As the stars in their courses are fighting against Parker, anyway, what
Watson says for himself and vicariously for Hearst will not make much dif
ference, but it will add to the joy and gayety of the campaign.
HEARST AND WATSON.
As his name implies. Sir William is
a Scotchman, and like most of that
sturdy race who achieve distinction, he
started in life without any wealth or
family influence to push him along. His
father was a farmer in a small way,
but with big ideas as to the value of
an education, and he saw to It that
his boy got a good one. When it came
to the choice. of. a, profession, the lad
elected medicine and obtained his M. D.
degree from the University of Edin
burgh. Being of an adventurous spirit
and anxious to see something of the
world, Instead of hanging out his shin
gle in some country town and waiting
for patients to come, he booked himself
at the Colonial Office and was ap
pointed Government medical officer at
the Seychelles In 1873. A year later he
was transferred to Port Louis" on the
island of Mauritius, and in 1875 was
made chief medical officer for Fiji.
It was at Fiji he proved himself a
hero. The ship. Syria, , freighted with
coolies and- their families, was wrecked
on the Nasilal Reef. He organized the
relief party and 'â¢ took command of it.
Repeatedly he swam, to "the wreck, re
turning each time with : a man or
woman on his back and sometimes -with
a child in - addition, gripped by its
clothes between his teeth. , In this way
he himself saved -no less than seventy
lives. It .was a feat that only a- man
of his Immense physical strength as
and claims to distinction. He Is no
carpet knight and there is nothing of
the court lackey about him. In some
of the wildest regions of the British
empire his work has been done, ruling
over savage tribes under tropical suns,
defying fever and fatigue, taking his
life in his hands olten and always ad
ministering justice with firm and fear
less impartiality. At fifty-seven he has
earned the right to the comparative
ease and quiet wnlch the Governor
ship of England's oldest colony will af
ford him, now that the troublesome
French question has been practically
settled.
The principal occupation of these Es
kimos (of Arctic Alaska) during the
spring is the hunting of the bowhead
whale in the leads, or open water, and
among the floe ice of the Arctic Ocean?
The taking of a whale Is always a
time of great rejoicing with these peo
ple, for it means not only an abun
dance of food and fuel, but a large
amount of valuable trading material.
After the whaling season is over the
boats which have been used In the
chase are gathered on the leads be
tween the pack and shore ice, which
1b often some miles from shore, at
the foot of some road that has been
cut through the rough ice from the
land to the water. The most success
ful boat's crew, . with their umiak (a
whaling boat covered with skins), takes
the lead, followed by the other boats
in the order of their success. The har*
poons, floats, paddles and everything
pertaining to the chase of the whale
are placed in their respective posi
tions. The umiak is then placed on a
flat ivory runnered sled and lashed
firmly in place. The owner, who is
called omelic (head man), stands on
the ice at' the right hand side of the
bow; the boat steerer stands at the
stern and. the paddlers stand at their
respective places along the sides of
the boat. When all Is ready, the omelic
gives the word to go forward and each
of the crew slips over his shoulder a
broad breast strap of sealskin which
is attached to a short line made fast
to the thwarts of the boat. When all
is ready the boat is pulled forward a
few lengths and the next boat in order
goes through the same form, . moving
on in its turn, until all the umiaks are
strung out in a long line on the
grounded ice| ready for their return to
land.
At a signal from the head boat all
move forward, : chanting weird songs
of the goodness and power of the
whale; for one of the superstitions of
these people is that whenever working
on any object to be used in whaling
or doing anything . connected with
whaling they must constantly extol the
merits of this great animal.
Long before the boats reach shore
the ; entire population left in the vil
lageâmen, women, children and dogs
Â¦ â congregate oh the beach to welcome
the homacomers. When the rirst boat
nears land it is] brought to a halt a
few feet from the shore line, and Its
talisman, which is always carried in a
little pouch in the bow, and may be
a wolf s head, the. head of a raven.
Iron pyrites or any odd thing, is lifted
out ; by the omelic and held; In, his
right .hand, toward -the 'shore, where
stands the chief : medicine "man of the
tribe, who pours over it a little freih
water to refresh it and thank it for the
benefits ', given, if â¢ the boat has secured
.1 whale; or. If the boat has not .he<sn
lucky, to appease any. slight that may
have been put upon the talisman, in
the hope that it will give them better
luck in the future.

It was to Lagos Sir William was next
despatched as Governor and this post
he held for four years, preserving an
even balance of justice to whites and
blacks and winning the esteem of all
classes. The Alake's State lies within
the Lagos Protectorate and that dusky
potentate when he left England pro
fessed profound sorrow that he and
Sir William were no longer to be chums

guished predecessor at Lagos, the late
Sir John Hawley Glover, was also pro
moted to the Governorship of New

the tribe and any other people who
may be in the village. First a wind
break of umiaks, sails or skins Is
built to act as a shelter against the
chilly blasts of the polar winds. It is
placed in the form of a large circle,
If enough material can be secured. In
the center of which a walrus hide is
placed on the ground, and to Its four
corners are tied long ropes, which are
passed over tripods placed about
twenty-five feet from the skin. The
ends of the ropes are then drawn
tight and made fast with stout stakes
driven into the ground, thus raising
the skin about four feet. The skin
thus becomes a platform some eight
or ten feet square, which serves as a
sort of movable stage on which the
young women dance.
The feast usually begins at the time
when the sun reaches a due western
point, about 6 o'clock in the after
noon; for during the eighty days of
summer at Otkeavic the sun never
sets, and being without timepieces the
Eskimos mark their time by the po
sition of the sun while it is visible and
by the moon and stars when the sun
has gone for the long Arctic night.
These feasts sometimes last twenty
four hours. â From Edward A. Mcll

/ SHALL NOT BE A CANDIDATE FOR NOR SHALL I ACCEPT A RENOMINATION,â Parker's Speech of Nomination.
(COPYRIGHT. 1801. BY SPECIAL. ARRANGEMENT WITH THE BAN FRANCISCO CAIJi AND THB NEW YORK EVENING MAIL,.)
San Francisco, Aug. 24.
The Editor of The Callâ Sir: ThÂ«
forthcoming festivities of the Knights
Templar demand that the city put on
her best appearance and show thÂ«
visitors that she, though young ia
years, has every pretension to beautify
In her ornamentations and buildings,
apart from her many natural surround
ings. A great deal has been written.
of late about the beautifying of our
city and those In command of wealth
have been urged to do their utmost in
this particular; but In the face of thÂ»
outrage which is now being perpetrated
right In the very heart of the city,
how can we expect our wealthy citi
zens to beautify and adorn the cityâ
for their endeavors may meet with th*
same fate. I refer to the "pile of lum
ber" which is now being erected right
in front of the Lick statuary in City
Hall Square. That such an outrage
should be permitted by the authorities
Is, to use a mild term, most disgrace
ful. The Lick statuary is considered
one of the finest works of art that
we possess and why It should be ob
scured at the very time when we
should display It Is a conundrum, but
one which no doubt the city authorities
can unravel. Whoever granted the per
mission for this unsightly erection
have been guilty of a most illegal act.
for the square in question is as much
the property of thÂ» people as Golden
Gate Park or Union Square and car
ries with it the same rights and priv
ileges. That there is a Jobbery in the
matter is beyond question and what
ever money is received from this "pile
of lumber" will no doubt go into the
pockets of those who are ever ready
to take their share of the public loot.
An appeal to the courts would un
doubtedly condemn such an outrage
and show the authorities that they
are in office for the protection of the
people's rights and not for their own
private ends. The Mayor. It Is pre
sumed â that is if he and Abraham un
derstand the duties of their position â
will receive the visiting Templars in
the rqtunda of the City Hall, right
under th* dome, and If they do so, then
still more unsightly will appear this
obnoxious obstruction. In the inter
ests of the city this matter should be
taken up and the authorities compelled
to remove this "pile of lumber" before
the Templar festivities commence. It
is Indeed a poor compliment to thÂ»
memory of James Lick that this group
of statuary should be hidden from view
simply to satisfy the greed of thoss
in power. Trusting that your influence
will be used to abate this outrage, I
am, sir, yours respectfully,
MICHAEL ANGELO.
To Remove an Eyesore.
San Francisco has voted bonds for more parks and pleasure-grounds
atid breathing places made beautiful. Oakland cannot afford to remain
squalid and undeveloped in all these respects, and we cannot believe that
she will.
The lake as an asset, contributing to the charms of the city and to its
property values, is worth million?. Its sufficient depth and calm surface
offer splendid opportunities for sailing and rowing and fishing. Everything
romantic and poetic and sentimental associated with the water may be en
joyed there when the boulevard is finished and the shores are improved.
â¢ Part of this improvement consists of the construction of a park on the
south side of the lake, where now is an unsightly flat, and in practically sur
rounding this splendid water park by a land park, connected with a foofc
'hill park.
A study of the park system proposed by the bond issue discloses a plan
that will furnish Oakland with a series of irresistible attractions, making it
one of the finest show cities in the Union. The foothill and water parks are
balanced by the beginning of a park system in West Oakland, of which the
De Fremery tract will be the gateway. When that system is completed, by
occupying what was formerly the noisome West Oakland marsh, and is con
nected with the water park by a boulevarded street, the city will have a
continuous park drive the jnost charming of any in the country.
The day is gone by when it should be necessary to submit to the citizens
of a city arguments and plans and specifications to prove the extreme utility
and great benefit of such public improvements. Every dollar spent on them
will add ten dollars to the value of Oakland property immediately and will
give it a progressive increase in value that will carry all the cost of the bond
issue so lightly that none will feel it.
The clement climate of Oakland is favorable to the most splendid ef
fects of landscape gardening. Everything luxurious and beautiful in flow
ers and foliage has a home there. With no winter to check growth every
inch of park space devoted to that purpose can be clad in joy and beauty
in a brief time. When our people travel they see the parks of the East. The
climate permits the use of only a limited variety of trees and shrubs. These
must be hardy to resist the rigors of winter and mostly deciduous, so that
the parks are bleak except for a few months. Even the evergreens in that
.climate are cold and severe in their winter green, while here every day in
the year our conifers and other evergreens are as attractive and beautiful as
a bride's bouquet.
To refuse now to take advantage of all thaj nature offers to Oakland
will be a case of unpardonable indifference and neglect. We desire to impress
our neighbors of that city with the extremely material and practical nature
of these surface improvement?. A private citizen improves his grounds. He
'feels that by lawns and flower-bearing borders and festooned vines he is
increasing not only the attractiveness cf his home, but is adding to its value
at the same time that he adds to the pleasure and comfort of occupying it.
The same impulse which makes the private citizen paint his house, build
attractive walks and plant his grounds beautifullj', makes a city, by public
enterprise, improve its surface attractions and make itself beautiful.
Every voter in* Oakland who lives in a painted house, has a vine festoon
ing his lintel and a rose blooming on his lawn, should vcrte for these bonds,
Â¦in order to bring public enterprise in adorning the city up to the private
efforts of its citizens on their own grounds. Nature has done all she can
for Oakland. Now it is man's turn to make wise use of her capacities of cli
* mate and location and make it a city of equal beauty in its public and its pri
vate possession*.
rpHE bond campaign in Oakland seems to lag. There have been a few
â¢ I sporadic efforts made to rouse interest in the subject, but there is a
' 1 failure of continuous effort, and there seems to be no organized move
ment to push the proposition to success. This may be due to the temporary
appearance of other interests, such as the political conventions, the Knights
Templar conclave and the observance of the two September holidays. What
ever the cause, it is hoped that it is merely temporary and is not due to in
difference or opposition to the great step forward implied in the improve
| rr/ents for which the issue is to provide.
Oakland occupies an extremely commanding position and needs only to
improve upon what nature has done to be put in the front rank of the beau
tiful, cities of the world. In Lake Merritt she has a water park that no other
city in this country or Europe can equal. It is not a pond nor a pool, nor a
spot "of stagnant moisture, but an extensive sheet of land-locked sea water,
clean and wholesome. The shores are in most part picturesque, and those
portions that are not at present charming are to be improved by the pro
ceeds of these bonds, so that a noble sheet of water' may have a noble
setting. . , Â¦'

When Judge Fritz's friends meet
him the first question they ask is
'Where's my cigar?" It is a josh on
the Judge. He was a passenger on
the train bearing the picnickers of St.
Agnes* parish from Sunset Park last
Saturday which collided with another
train shortly after leaving the park.
It was there he lost his cigar.
The Judge was talking to several
younsr ladies and had Just lighted the
last cigar in his possession to soothe
his nerves when the crash came. The
cigar was thrown out of his mouth
and a lamp chimney hit the top of
his head. For a moment he thought
some one had started a rough house
and a friend found him groping under
the seats.
"For heaven's sake." said the friend.
"what are you doing there? Are you
hurt?" V
"Hurt nothing!" scornfully replied
the Judge. "Where's my cigar?"

â¢ Mrs. Torntsrom-is 20 years old and
more than ordinarily pretty. On July
13 of last year she was wedded to Cap
tain Tornetrom," thirty years her senior.
On April 6 she felt compelled to desert
him and sought refuge with her sister
in this city. The master of the vessel
brought sutt for divorce and charged
his young wife, in vague and unspe
ciflc terms, with having been unfaith
ful to her vows. She promptly re
sponded with an answer and cross
complaint, in which she denied all of
his allegations and in turn sued for
divorce on the grounds of his extreme
cruelty.
After her marriage, arid with her
husband's consent, Mrs. Tornstrom
studied to qualify herself as a profes
sional nurse. . Her sister, Hilda Fried,
is now a graduate nurse in the County
Hospital. Both appeared in Judge
Hunt's court yesterday and told a rare
story in response to the questioning of
Mrs. Tornstrom's attorney, Arthur H.
Barendt. .
Mrs. Tornstrom reluctantly told tha
court the details of the abuse to which
she was subjected on a cruise of the
Ludlow from San Pedro to Washington
ports and return. She said her husband
exhibited Jealousy when she petted the
dog on board the ship, and when. she
invited hi3 19-year-old son to take
cocoa with them in the cabin the boy's
father accused his bride of caring more
for the lad than she did for him. Other
things happened on the trip, including
various assaults, which left her marked
black and blue. On the homeward run
the captain, carrying a heavy personal
cargo of booze, compelled his wife to
accompany him to a low resort in Port
Townsend. His actions and treatment
of her mortified her beyond endurance
and she wrote to her sister for funds
with which to leave him. The funds
were sent and the desertion followed.
Tornstrom followed her to San Fran
cisco and was menacing, but to no
avail. Attorney William HofT Cook ap
peared for the sea captain,, but offered
no questions, and the divorce was
granted on the wife's cross complaint.
Judge Hunt yesterday made another
ruling in the protracted case of Dina
Smith against Andrew Smith for di
vorce. He denied the motion to reopen
the case and denied again her applica
tion for divorce, but ordered that Smith
should 'pay her $45 a month for the sup
port of herself and child. On the first
ruling he onlv ordered that the hus
band should pay $10 a month for the
care of the babe; but when Mrs. Smith
called to make up her husband received
her with a wagon spoke, and he will
have to pay the price. .
Twenty-five years of cruelty was re
cited yesterday In the answer of Sophia
Smith to the suit for divorce begun by
her husband, Theophilus Smith, who
has an office at 111 Broadway, New
York. He charged her with all kinds
of mistreatment. Including a habit of
calling him vile names at his place of
business and in the presence of his as
sociates. She . denies the allegations
and says that he has been cruel to her
since 1S79 and has prevented her from
seeing her three children, the oldest of
whom is 25 years of age. She charges,
too, that, with the children, he was un
lawfully living with one Jessie Marks
in New Jersey and at Toronto, Canada.
Divorces were granted yesterday by
Judge Murasky to Thomas G. Millar
from Grace W. Millar for desertion; by-
Judge Hebbard to Lena A, Jacobs from
Ernest Jacobs, neglect; by Judge
Troutt, In Judge SIoss' court, to John
H. Musgrove from Emma Musgrove,
intemperance; to "Anna C. McNeiU from
Goerge A-'McNelll, neglect; by Judge
Kerrigan to Bessie E. Loebel from Al
ton Loebel, desertion and neglect.
Suits for divorce were filed by Annie
E. Musgrave against George Musgrave
for cruelty: Sterling Lord-Whitney
against Morgia Lord-Whitney, deser
tion; JEdwin B. Merrltt against Mary
E. Merritt, desertion; Joseph, Pod esta
against Ruby A. Podesta, crueltv. ..
A part recompense for the mistake
of her life was yesterday given by
Judge Hunt to Alma Fried Tornstrom
in the form of an interlocutory decree
of divorce from "William Tornstrom,
erstwhile captain"' of the schooner Lud
low.
Â«The opinion declares that it is the
duty of the board to make the inves
tigation and one method is to call upon
the bidders themselves to furnish sat
isfactory evidence of their ability to
fulfill the contract. In awarding the
contract without investigating, while
considered for the best interest of the
hospital, the board had a mistaken
view of its duty. .Under its power to
reject any and all bids the board could
not arbitrarily reject any bid without
Inaulry or* investigation as to the re
sponsibility of the bidders.
Judgment is ordered restraining-the
defendants from entering into a con
tract with Wheaton, Pond & Harrold
for supplying butter to the Napa State
Hospital unless, after proper investi
gation, the board shall determine they
are the lowest responsible bidders. ;^. :
The position taken by the managers was that
the successful bidders had performed a con
tract satisfactorily the previous year and it
was wiser to make the award to them even at
higher prices. Tho court's opinion Is that such
a pasltlon has no support in the statutes. If
lgnoranca of the qualifications of other bid
ders, as to whom no investlsatlon Is made.
can Justify an award to the highest bidder,
the persons first obtaining contracts can con
tinue to get them indefinitely without fear cf
competition, and the mandatory requirements
of thÂ« statutes are practically nullified.
It Is well settled that In determining the re
sponsibility of bidders the board Is not limited
to pecuniary responsibility, but It Is Its duty
also to consider their integrity, skill and expe
rience, and facilities for carrying out the pro
posed contract.
The discretion which the. board Is empowered
to exercise In awarding contracts for supplies
Is what is known as a sound legal discretion,
which excludes arbitrary or capricious action.
The courts have no power to control euch a dis
cretion, nor compel the board to award a con
tract to a particular bidder, but they have the
power to restrain the abuse of that discretion.
In this case there were seven bidders upon
the butter contract, at prices materially lower
than the bids cf, the parties to whom the con
tract waa awarded. Conceding that the board
had power to reject the bids of those whose
performance of previous contracts had been.un
eatlsfactory. there were at least four of the
seven bidders as to whom the board had no
knowledge or information, and as to whose
qualifications no Inquiry or Investigation was
made. Â¦..--Â¦
In passing upon the suit of the A.
L. Lundy Company for an injunction,
which he has had under submission for
several days, Judge Seawell finds that
the asylum managers exceeded their
authority and he orders that they be
restrained from letting the contract
until they have investigated the re
sponsibility of other and lower bidders.
The Lundy Company had formerly fur
â¢nished butter and eggs to the asylum
and was among the lower bidders
whose bids were rejected. In the evi
dence taken in the trial of the case
the asylum managers stated that Lun
dy's butter was rancid and his eggs
bad.
The substance of Judge Seawell's
written opinion is as follows:
The action of the board of managers
of the Nara Insane Asylum In award
ing the contract for the supplying of
butter for the Institution to Wheaton,
Pond & Harrold, when at least seven
bidders had offered to furnish the stuff
at a lower figure, is criticized by Su
perior Judge Seawell.

have the dome illuminated during
their convention was referred to the
3 .lent Committee.
The petition of the Police Commis-
Ficn that charter an endments be sub
mitted to place the matter of promo
lions in the Police Department in the
hands of the Police Commission, inde
l'*.-ndent of civil service, was referred
to the Amendment Committee.
Similar action was taken on the pe
tition of the engineers of the Fire De
partment that their pay be increased
to 51 6 SO yearly.
Brandenstein explained that â¢ the
r.mendment conflicted with one al
ready adopted to increase, among
others, the salaries of engineers to
$1470. but the board had no alterna-
Tive but to submit the two opposing
iimen<Jments to^.he voters.
The Mayor was authorized to sell at
nuction ten horseg' unfit for Fire De
partment use.

"We want the public to under
stand." said Brandenstein, "that these
amendments will be submitted to the
electors without the approval, express
or Implied, of the Board of Super
v;sors, but only because the constitu
tion requires it under the conditions
eÂ» they exist."
With that understanding: each Su
pervisor of the fourteen present voted
to submit the amendments.
The first amendments to be consid
ered were those petitioned for to give
municipal employes a half holiday on
Katurdays, fixing their hours of service
lrom 9 a. m. to 4 p. m., and giving
them two weeks' vacation with pay
In each calendar year. Brandenstein,
â¢who presided in the absence of the
Mayor, stated that under the State
constitution the petitions having been
tigned by more than 15 per cent of the
voters, the board had no alternative
bur to submit the amendments to the
people, without, however, sanctioning
ihem in any way. Braunhart thought
the proposed amendments were ill
advised, would entail endless compli
cations and affect all employes, includ
ing laborers, with the exception of
those, of 'the Fire and Police depart
ments. The change would result in
the substitution of the contract system
for day labor and an enormous added
<xpensc which would not be possible
iinder the proposed amendment limit
ing city expenditures to the income re
ceived by an S5-cent tax lexy.
GIVE NOTICE TO PUBLIC.
â¢ The Board of Supervisors held a
, Ei>ecial meeting yesterday for the pur
pose of considering two petitions Uled
*or .the submission of charter amend
ments affecting municipal employes.
The petitions purported to have been
e;gned by more than 12.000 voters in
tach case.
Prices, are being quoted in China
town as follows: For landing a Chi
nese woman, $750;. for landing a Chi
nese man, $175, and money in many
instances has been paid to the grafters
under the belief that it will be used
to bribe Federal' officials.
Another young girl is in the deten
tion shed with Mee Ho and her case
is similar. The missionary people will
take these girls in charge as soon as
they shall have been landed, if they
are landed at all.
- Mee Ho is a guileless Chinese maiden
of sixteen years, who arrived . on the
steamship China on July 25 and- whose
case has not yet been taken up, by- the
Chinese Bureau. Charles <Mehan, ; the
'inspector in charge, said yesterday that
the' girl .claims: to have been* born in
this State and: that -she left,, this port
and went to China at the age of four
years, twelve years ;ago. She had. not
been. denied a landing.-he.said, but the
â¢bureau had- not yet had time, owing
to the pressure of business, to take up
the girl's case and .pass .upon it. :
Some time ago Mrs. â Davis of the
Chinese Methodist Mission .learned -that
a. certain -Chinaman; in this city- was
preparing -to' marry the gtri; who her
: self feared- that the 4narriage ceremony
Â¦ was intended only 'to coyer transition
into the life. of. a slave : for immoral
purposes. ."Recently a Chinaman has
represented to his white ' friends that
it will be necessary for him r to raise
$1200 before the girl willbe allowed to
land, thus giving them the impression
that there Is something sinister in the
delay of the Chinese Bureau to pass
upon -her case. 'â¢* -
The bureau people. say that it is an
old trick of Chinese blackmailers and
grafters, to collect money ostensibly for
the purpose of bribing officials to land
Chinese and then to put the money into
their own pockets.
The case of a certain shyster lawyer
is the latest "development, of this phase
of grafting. Learning that a certain
Chinaman was about to be landed by
the bureau, he went to the Chinaman
and collected - $100 from him, on the
guarantee that he would be landed
upon payment of- that sum. The mat
ter was reported to Immigration Com
missioner North and he at once ! filed
a complaint with the department at
;Washington to have the shyster dis
barred so far as the Chinese Bureau is
concerned.

Fran* Nordman, a Finnish mariner,
was deep-laden with fiery waters as
he staggered along the Barbary Coast
night before last. At the intersection
of Pacific and. Kearny streets he saw
a stalwart blue-coated human form
with back turned toward him and bore
down upon It, grasped one of its arms
and sharply swung it around.
"What did you der that for?" In
quired Patrolman "Jack" Stelzner. for
none other than that former practition
er of the fistic art it happened to be.
"Just to see," replied Mr. Nordman,
in a dialect that is unproducible In
print, y'what y.our star looks like."
"Come with me and I'll not only
show it to you. but tell you all about
how I pot it," said the officer.
Franz balked, of course, and equal
ly of course he finally went where the
officer desired. Aa he stood before
Patrolmen Regan and O'Connell ar
rested Ralph Sloane for selling lottery
tickets at 42 Second street and then
proceeded to 1312 Market street, where
they arrested James "W. Carson for
a similar offenEe. Both the defendants
pleaded guilty and Judge Cabaniss
fined them $40 apiece.
Rakuro Sato. lately of Japan, was
before Judge Cabaniss on the charge
of having stolen a dining-room chair
from the residence of Mrs. F. F. Mln
naker. 1571 Jackson street, and trying
to sell it at 1808 Polk street, where he
was arrested by Patrolman George
Graham. Case continued till to-day.
Case continued till this morning in
order to allow Mr. Siegenthaler to In
troduce character testimony.
Charles Eiegenthaler declared he was
rot a fighting man, but a peaceably
disposed payer of taxes, and he would
like to have that fact thoroughly un
derstood before Judge Conlan heard
the testimony of the policeman who
charged him with exhibiting a deadly
weapon in a saloon on Fourth street,
near Market. His Honor commended
Mr. Slegenthaler's precaution and then
listened attentively .while tire police
man told of how he had found a large
pistol fully loaded In the defendant's
possession.
*'I pulled the bun," Mr. Eiegenthaler
explained, "not with Intent to shoot,
but simply for the purpose of intim
idating a gang of toughs that was
'doing ur>' a friend of mine. I believe
they would have killed him If my dis
play of firearms and threat to pull
the trigger had not bluffed them off."
A more unlikely looking vagrant than
Mo Kai never faced that charge in a
police court, yet there it confronted
him. written in black and white and
pressed by no less an authority on Ce
lestial vagabondage than Patrolman
Keed of the Chinatown squad. Mo Kai
was tall of stature, dignified of mien,
wore the natty black silken skullcap,
the pea-green silken blouse and the
pink silken trousers of the Chinese
mercantile class. And his facial ex
pression and embellishment were In
perfect accord with the respectability
suggested by his attire. His features
were placid and wax-colored and a
beard of conventional Confucian trim
drooped from his lean nether jaws.
"You don't mean to say that this
man is a 'vag?* " exclaimed Judge Cab
aniss as Mo Kai kowtowed to him with
Oriental gravity.
"That's whatâ a four-ply Tmm," was
the officer's response.
"Where did he get that gorgeous ap
parel?"
"Blackmailing women."
"Four months In the County Jail."
"No, sah; I'se a union bahbah, an'
doan break no union rules.'" On- Sun
day I play baseball in Golden Gate
Fahk, kase I needs de recreaushun."
"You certainly must need cessation
from your interminable toil, Mr. Stew
art, "and when you reappear here to
morrow morning I'll prescribe a dose of
rest-cure for you."
"Dis yah officah," said Stewart,
"ain't agwine ter mean. ter swear 4 dat
he sees me loafln* on Pacific street all
de time. Showly he must jjive me
credit fer doin" a little sleep. De fack
am, Jedge, dat der ain't no moah in
dustrus coloahed man dan I am ter
be foun' anywheres. I wuks all day a
bahbahin, an* at night I- thumps a
piano in one ob de dance halls. If dat
ain't a gwine some as a wukker, Ise'd
like ter know what am."
"But you don't work as a barber on
Sundays, do you?" asked Judge Conian.
apparently interested in the confession
of a strenuous life.
George Stewart (colored) hotly con
tested the accusation of vagrancy filed
against him by Patrolman Nelson,
whose beat covers the Barbary Coast.
"If you insist that this woman has
swindled you," said the Judge to the
defendant, "you should proceed against
her by civil action for recovery of your
alleged property, but I cannot ignore
her complaint that you disturbed her
peace by your nocturnal wanderings
and maunderings. I'll continue the case
till August 31, and would suggest, for
your own benefit, that you keep away
from her in the meantime."
Mr. Scharf pleaded that his claim
en the furniture was no mere figment
of a disordered brain. \ For seven
years, he said, he has known Mrs. "Bal
lard and until January 3 last, when he
installed her as housekeeper for him
self and son, he considered her a
woman of exemplary character. Dls- j
Illusion came with the discovery that
she Jiad conspired with a colored man,
n?.me not given, to obtain possession
of the furniture, which she did by
transferring it to her dusky accom
plice, although she had no legal right
10 do so. His efforts to recover it she
treated with s.Â»orn, daringhim to do
his worst, and threatening to throw
him into the street- if he did not let
her alone. Â«. -
â¢'Id vas dese things, Schoodge, said
Mr. Scharf, "dat made me mad ged.
Yen I dry to schleep der trobble keep
me avake, und den I valk der hallvay
in ter get minsellef schleep yet. Den
she me in brison put so dat I von'd be
aliowid ter claim vat is mine owin." j
Supplementing the aforegoing plea
was a. charge that Mrs. Ballard, in
furtherance of her plan to rid the
house of the Scharf s, had put salt in'
the younger man's coffee and stolen
iZ- from a pocket of the elder's panta
leons. â¢
Mrs. Ballard, a comfortable looking
matron, smiled derisively as Mr. Scharf
urged his defense and audibly ex- J
pressed hope that the court wouldn't i
allow itself to be gulled by such j
-stuff." - â¢ - â¢ '
Mrs. Jennie Ballard requested Po
lice Judge Cabaniss to restrain Joseph
Scharf, carpenter, from disturbing the
peace of her domicile, '5813 Valencia
street. She permits him and his 1S
year-old son to board and lodge there,
the averred, despite the fact that they
imagine they have some sort. -of a
proprietary claim on the furniture.
This hallucination has led Mr. Scharf
Sr. to rise from his bed at. unseemly
hours and parade the â¢ hallways,
thumping the door of her chamber
and exploding indelicate language.
The thing had become monotonous
Â»nd she desired to have it stopped by
the law's strong hand.. â¢
Isadore Burg, charged with bigamy,
was held to answer before' the Supe
rior Court in $4000 bonds by Judge
Cabaniss. He deserted his wife and
two children in London, England, and
came here and married Annie L. Perl
stein on July 9. His deserted wife fol
lowed him with her two children to
this city and coused his arrest on the
bigamy charge.
After serving three months* impris
onment for disturbing the. peace, Jake
Emige, who . threatened to day Miss
Etta Raymond of 448 Linden avenue,
will reapp~eiu\ before Judge Conlan and
ascertain. just what bond he must furr
nish as .assurance that he will let the
woman alone.
Miss Raymond appeared In court
yesterday,, and displayed a letter writ
ten to her by.Kmige after his arrest.
The missive was. frightfully spelled
and punctuated. and informed the ad
dressee that if she desired to. retain
possession of her life she .would, for
get to prosecute the writer.- V
"Just now' you seem to be in a';dan
gerous state of .mind," .said the Judge
to the defendant, "and for your 'own
sake as well as the- complainant's safe
ty I think it best to send you to jail,
where you will have time' to recon
sider your apparent determination' to
kill." .-Â¦ - ;;; .
Emige threatened the woman's, life
because she tired of. his attentions and
refused to return, certain love tokens
which he had given to her during the
days of their courtship. 'J. Â¦ .
Judge Conlan, yesterday morning be
glanced admiringly at his captor and
declared that never in his maritime
experience had he been so scientifical
ly man-handled and he would like to
have the court realize that his was no
ordinary experience. He could show
cranial scars in proof of his assertion
that he had run afoul of more than
one-mate who could wield a belaying
pin with stunning effect. The beauty
of his encounter with Stelzner, how
ever, consisted of the fact that- no
weapon was used on either side. And
he seemed to be quite pleased to pay
the $5 tine that Judge Conlan taxed
him.

SHOULD YOU BUY?
You know something .about pianos; you know some or all
of the makes which we sell ; but if you didn't then the fifty-
four years of age and general standing of our. company would
be worth as much to you as knowledge of the instrument. *v
\. It may not occur to everyone th"U It pays . sometimes to sell goods
at cost, and even at less than cost, but the good merchant will tell you
. this is so. We have not only to clear out a large number of used pianos
during the next few days, but in addition to these we have a matter of
thirty- to forty odd' styles in absolutely new pianos â sample instruments
and styles dropped from catalogue, which must and will be sold regardless
of former prices. Now is the time for the prudent man or woman, who
needs a piano or organ, to buy.
% TO J4 LESS THAN REGULAR PRICES
Selections are now offered from new pianos as well as used pianos â the
" " largest stock in San Francisco â almost any style and wood you wish, and
prices which justify a much earlier purchase than may have been con-
templated. The time to buy is when you can buy cheap â that time is now.
;' Select your piano now. If not in every way as represented you have thÂ«
;. privilege of exchange. We sell no instrument wo do not guarantee.

Frank Thompson and Oscar Field
entered the Jewelry store of William
Casanova, 1418 Stockton street, yes
terday morning. They said they want
ed to purchase a wedding ring. They
were shown a collection, but none
pleased them and they left hurriedly.
Casanova was quick to discover that
a "phony" ring had been substituted
for one valued at $8 and he ran out
side and blew his police whistle. Po
licemen George Douglass and F. W.
Esola responded and gave chase after
Thompson and Field, who were soon
overtaken. They were charged at the
City Prison with petty larceny. The
wedding ring was found in Field's
pocket.
Will Make Test Case.
Thomas Mullane, a non-union hack
man, was arrested yesterday morning
by Hack Inspector Gorman and book
ed at the City Prison on a charge of
violating the hack ordinance. The
arrest was made in accordance with
a prearranged plan betw4en~the in
spector and the Citizens' Alliance to
test the constitutionality of the refusal
of the Police Commissioners to issue
licenses to Mullane and other non
union hackmen. Mullane was re
leased on $10 cash bail.
The German heirs of Simon H. Sey
mour have come in with an answer to
the contest of the will begun by Susan
C. Seymour, the widow. Seymour left
an estate worth $200,000, giving half
of the community property to his wife.
The remainder was divided into three
parts and bequeathed to the children
of a brother and sister at St. Louis
and the children of a deceased brother
in Germany. The latter are Minna
Biokineier and six other children of
Henry Kordmeler. They deny Mrs.
Seymour's charges that the will was
not the last will of her husband, that
it was not properly signed and exe
cuted and that he was of unsound
mind at the time of making the al
leged will.

Constant liquidation attended the lo*s In
wheat values. An almoet total absence of
"scare" news Influenced the selling. The bot
tom had apparently dropped out of the market.
There were few of the heavy bulls active In
thÂ«. pit to-day. They seemed to have re
tired, at least temporarily, and left the mar
ket without support. The cause* for the
slump were patent. The weather in the North
west was all that the mest decided bear could
wish. There was no rain where rain would
cause damage and predicted frosts failM to
apjear. Such support as the market had was
given (through purchases by shorts, but thera
was no hesitancy, no reaction and apparently
little attempt on the part ot local buils to
stem the current of price recession. Sep

with lower futures.
Chicago dropped sharply from $1 O8V4 to
$1 03Vi on better crop reports from the North

created a better feeling in the grain trade.
A good deal of long Wheat came out on the

Hay and Feedstuff s. <
Hay and Feedstuffs stand about as before
stated. Bran continues easy. Of Hay the
circular of Seniors & Co. says:
"Shipments of hay still continue exceed
ingly heavy, the total for the week amount
ing to 0500 tons, which is an increase over
last week's account. In spite of such heavy
arrivals there is yet a large quantity of hay
on the Oakland tracks awaiting shipment here
I as soon as there is room for It. With such
heavy arrivals the market has taken a very
dull turn, and nothing but the choicest
grades seem to find ready sale. We note a
continuance of a rather quiet demand locally,
many consumers having decided to take their
: chances and buy as they may need for hay
during the season. Some little hay is still
going South, but these shipments seem in no
way to relieve our market. It is now being
thoroughly proven that the crop this year is
much heavier than that of last. Already it is
1 threatening rain and there are still large
: quantities of hay out of doors not yet even
baled. Storms throughout the South and
Middle West would seem' to Indicate that we
; might expect rain here at a rather early
: date. To summarize, therefore, we would
! state that prospects for the Immediate future
1 are rather discouraging, for lack cf transpor-
I tatlon facilities and the general dullness of
; trade here will tend to keep back quite a bit
i of hay in the fields until a rather late date.
"We. give, no material change in quotations
from the prices given last week, although
there Is an undercurrent of weakness In all
lines except perhaps choice wheat hay." -

there is an abundance of overripe offerings

freely, but they are meeting with a better
demand and fancy etock from the mountain

Neil' York Cotton
NEW YORK, Aug. 24. â The excitement
continued in to-day's cotton market The ;
market started firm at an advance of 4 'points
on Aujrust and of 13 to 21 points on the la{er
positions. There was lots of cotton for 'sal** at
the advance, and for a time fluctuations were
very Irretrular and rapid, with the list showing
h.irdly any tendency when Fhcrts were unset
tied by rumors that H. F. Page <& Co. of New
Orleans ha-i suspended. This concern was said
to be short of th- new crop, and part of the
; line was believed to be held in the local mar
! ket by various New York houses. When the
news of the failure was circulated the montns
supr-oaed 10 be Involved became tremendously
active. October sold at ,10.37#Â£10.fi2c in about
three transactions and later rosltlons were ai
mest equally excited. The bulls took profits
freely on the break, checking the advancing
tendency and easing the market slightly, but
in In* early afternoon a^ain supported it. Sen
timent was badly mixed and the trade was
peculiarly sensitive to rumors, which were
freely circulated. Prices wended upward until
they stool about 25 points higher. The market
closfd at practically the best prices of tha
session, cr a net gain of 20 to 51 points. Sales
were estimated at 700,000 bales.
The New Orleans market sold off about 10
to 12 points after the close here, and trans
actions were rvrorud at a decline of about
3 points as compared with the closing figures
last night.

with Judge Troutt yesterday morning
relative to the form of bond which the
house movers shall give to guarantee
payment of the cost of cutting the
company's wires in the process of
house moving. It was suggested that
a joint bond between the .litigants
would be the proper thing," so that
each side will be indemnified pending
the decision of their controversy on
the points of law. An agreement was
practically reached and will probably
be reported, to-day and nothing will

the case. The motion of the lighting

did. on the 15th day of August, 1904, In the
ca*e of Law vs. the city and county of San
Francisco, render & decision overruling the de
fendant's demurrer to the ninth cause of ac
tion set forth in plaintiffs complaint, which
la effect waÂ« a declaration that the' city and
county could not legally Issue Its bonds for
the purpose of acquiring lands for a public
park In that portion of the city known as
"Telegraph Hill." for the reason that the
proposition submitted to the Toters did not re
ceive a two-thirds rote of the -voters Yotln*
at the election held lor that purpose; and
Whereas, It will be impossible for the city
and county to prove that said proposition did
receive such two-thirds vote; therefore be It
Resolved. That the City Attorney be and he
la hereby Instructed to make no answer to
plaint ill's complaint and to stipulate that a
Judgment may be entered declaring the bonds
known as "Telegraph Hill bonds" to be in
valid; also be It
Resolved, That the Auditor t>e requested not
to compute upon the assessment roll so much
of the tax levy as was made for the purpose
of paying the Interest on and redeeming the
principal of said ""Telegraph Hill bonds"' and
that the Tax Collector be requested not to
collect any taxes levied for said purpoee.
NO PROTESTS NECESSARY.
Braunhart, who introduced the reso
lution, explained that the City At
torney had been consulted and held
that the resolution would obviate the
necessity of protests being filed against
the payment of the tax, which was
clearly Illegal in view of the court de
cision.

TO REPAIR PAVEMENT.
Commissioner of Works Maestretti
appeared before the Finance Commit
tee yesterday In behalf of the petition
of the Board of Works that some $1900
be allowed out of the urgent necessity
fund to repair the wooden block pave
ment In front of the Phelan building.
Maestretti said the repairs were ur
gently needed in view of the fact that
some $250,000 of the bond Issue for
repairing streets would not be available
for three months to come.
Supervisor d'Ancona contended that
the board has an appropriation of $40,
000 to repair bituminous streets and
some of the money should be used to
patch up the block although it was
not strictly a bituminous street. Maes
tretti was requested to confer with F.
M. Yorke, who has the contract, with
a view to inducing him to repair 1 the
worst holes in the pavement before
the Knights Templar conclave is held.

correct â and it sounded sane â the de

the members. The St. Francis is cen

What a bewildering bombardment of
entertainment Miss ElHnwood is re

some of the affairs, but in betj-othals

âstands in the limelight. After that,
it's the man's turn at leading parts.
Â¦Weddings are always fetching-, for
all the world loves a lover. But for
naval and military nuptials human in
terest doubles and it's the setting that
does it.
No prettier sight could have been
conjured up than the ceremonies at
tendant upon the nuptials of Miss
Frances Moore and Lieutenant John
S. Graham at St. Peter's yesterday at
Mare Island. The sanctuary was re
splendant with white blossoms, green
foliage and glistening palms, and
from the tangle of green wax candles
gleamed. On the arm of her father.
Commander C. B. T. Moore, the win
some bride entered the chapel, pre
ceded by Miss Helen Simons, the hon
or maid, and Miss Mattie Milton and
Miss Frances Waggoner as brides
maids, their pathway having been
strewn with rose leaves by the two
little flower girls, Mary Zahm and
Mary Gorgas.
The bride, a dainty maid of rare
coloring, was gowned in a simple
frock of white chiffon and wore a full
tulle veil.
After the ceremony a reception was
held at the home of the bride, whither
the following guests were bidden: Ad
miral and Mrs. Bowman H. McCalla,

NAVAL WEDDING

AT THE ISLAND
The board of engineers -whloh Is con
sidering plans for relieving the situa
tion In the river valleys during flood
times spent Its session yesterday in
listening: to the scheme of General W.
S. Green of Colusa. The editor's plan
Is very elaborate and would involve
the outlay of an Immense sum of
money. The members of the board
seemed rather doubtful of the practica
bility of the scheme. No action in the
matter was taken, but General Green's
idea will be considered with the other
solutions of this difficult problem.
J. W. Kearth, a civil engineer In the
employ of the Colusa editor, was also
heard at yesterday's session. He spoke
along the same lines as his employer
and helped explain the plan.
General Green thinks that numerous
canals should be built to carry off the
surplus water in times of flood. When
word is sent along the line that high
water Is coming, the gate at each out
let could be lifted and the overflow
would run oft*. The editor proposes
that the surplus water be then turned
into basins and kept until summer,
when It may be used in Irrigation.
While General Green and Mr. Kearth
were elucidating their plan. Major
Dabney, Mr. Nurse and Mr. Richard
son of the board asked innumerable
technical questions about working
methods. Commissioner Nurse partic
ularly seemed convinced that the plan
was not feasible and his fellow mem
bers of the board did not express their
approval. They were all of the opinion
that the scheme looked well on its face,
but they were skeptical about the solu
tion of the engineering problems In
volved.
The board will be at the^Flood build
ing again this mornlnsr to hear such
other plans as may be presented by in
terested citizens.
â¢ United: States Secret Sserrlo* JLgeats
â¢ Eaxen and Moffit yesterday arrested
. Jefse L- CrandelL for counterfeiting.
In GrandeU's room the secret service
â¢ net found $75 worth, of counterfeiting
tools and one of the neatest plaster
molds of the almighty dollar that they
â¢ had ever seen.
There was also a collection of fused
" metals, resembling silver, together with
â¢ bottles of acids and all the parapher
nalia for a counterfeiting outfit.
Crandell came from Michigan about
; four years ago and settled in Seattle,
* wh^re he was a nig-ht porter In restau
rants. He remained there three yeaxs
and came to this city about a year
ape and obtained employment as night
porter in a Market-street restaurant.
â¢About eleven months ago the secret
â¢service men discovered that between
1 atid S a. m., when there was very
â¢little doing in the restaurant, Cran
dell was occupied In making experi
ments with gold, silver, platinum, cop
per and other metals and in electro
plating.
Between three and four months ago
he turned his attention to experiment
ing on molds and on silver combined
Â¦with other metals to produce a com
posite metal that, when fused, would
not cxrand In the plaster mold. He
succeeded in making a perfect plaster
mold of a sliver dollar, and then the
F?cret 6er\ice men seized him, and his
plant.
Crandell confessed everything. He
. said he had been experimenting with
a view to making some improvement on
'electro plating and other things. Be
tween three and four months ago, he
<â¢ said, he began to experiment along the
line of counterfeiting coin. He had not
made any bad money, however, and
this statement the secret service men
found to be true.
A memorandum book â¢was found In
the prisoner's poeses'sion giving form
ula for fusing certain metals together.
The names of the metals and chemical
terms are spelled correctly and show
that Crandell is not illiterate.
He said he Tras unmarried and had

"In IS9I he came to this city, where
he entered Into partnership with his
brother, James P. Dunne. He had two
other brothers, Frank H. Dunne, Judge
of the Superior Court, and Thomas -F.
Dunne, president of the Western Oil
and Paint Company, and two sisters,
Mrs. James Orr and Mrs. A. G. Saeng
ster. The funeral will be held from St.
Brigid's Church to-morrow. Interment
Holy Cross Cemetery.
While Dr. Gallwey Is certain that
Captain Dunne's death was caused by
something he ate on Tuesday night, It
Is almost Impossible to ascertain what
it was. He dined that evening with
Bob Hampton, who ate a dinner simi
lar to the captain's. The only item
on the menu which Dunne ate and
Hampton did not was some tomato
salad.
Captain Peter J. Dunns died at the
Waldeck Sanatorium at an early hour
yesterday morning of ptomaine pois
oning. While chatting with some
friends outside of his place of business
Tuesday evening Captain Dunne sud
denly staggered and fell to the side
walk. He had lost consciousness, but
was writhing in pain.
He was taken to the Waldeck, where
Dr. Gallwey and Dr. McGettigan
worked over him all night, but he ex
pired without regaining consciousness
Just before dawn. His wife and four
daughters were at his bedside when he
died.
Few men in San Francisco have
made and held as many friends as
Peter J. Dunne. His untimely death
will be regretted by thousands In all
walks of life.
Peter J. Dunne was a native of Phila
delphia, 48 years old. When he was
three years of age his family crossed
the plains and settled in Nevada.
There he received his education and
spent his youth and early manhood.
In the stirring days of Nevada's his
tory the public-spirited young Dunne's
honesty, made him a prominent figure
in politics and business. In the mining
excitement Peter J. Dunne was known
as a square and fearless man.
From IS7O to 1890 he held several po
litical positions in Virginia City. He
was at one time captain of the Em
met Guards of .Nevada, in his time one
of the finest military organizations in
the country. John Mackay was his
friend. '

Following close on the publication of
a recent article in The Call to the ef
fect that the Supreme Court's decision
that the Telegraph Hill bond issue was
invalid would result in the collection
of an unnecessary tax of .0071 cents
for the same purpose which could not
be utilized for any purpose, the Board
of Supervisors yesterday adopted a
resolution providing that the Tax Col
lector be requested not to collect the
taxes so described. The amount pro
posed to be raised to pay the interest
and sinking fund of the bonds aggre
gated some $36,000 and under the terms
of the resolution the taxpayers will
not be compelled to pay the tax. The
resolution follows:
After devoting fourscore years to the
pursuit of a science dear to his heart,
George Washington Dunn, a naturalist
well known on two continents, applied
yesterday afternoon at the Board of
Health to become an inmate of the
City Almshouse. Although destitute
and hungry, the old man has at his
room at 364 Beach street many thou
sands of beautiful specimens of beetles
and butterflies valued at nearly 51000.
For these there is no market; or it
may be that he refused to part with
the results of his life work and clung
to them with closer tenacity as the
years crept upon him.
Up to a year ago, the scientist, who
Is now 91 years old, was able to pursue
his collecting of beautiful and rare
Insects. "With what money he could
make by supplying private individuals
with specimens he managed to eke out
an existence. * When this means of
support failed the old man had no
money. His landlord, D. L. Munson,
finally took him to the hospital, where
he was examined as to his sanity. As
he sat In the chair waiting the result
of the doctors' investigations he talked
of his travels and his work.
Dunn came to California in Septem
ber, 1849, but not to seek his fortune
In the mines. At that time he was
content with the bare necessities so
that he could pursue the work for
which he had a passion. Among his
patrons in those days were Baron
Rothschild and Lord Cholmondeley,
who wanted to take him to England.
In their behalf he made many trips
to South America in search of rarities.
Twelve times he has visited the South
ern American continent and the results
of his Journeys are in the museum of
the Baron and the Smithsonian Insti
tution at Washington.
Although a recognized authority on
all matters pertaining to bug and In
sect life the old naturalist never went
to college. He was graduated from a
high school at Lyons, N. V., but im
mediately sought the seclusion of the
fields and avoided the ordinary as
sociations of men. His friends were
among the most eminent scientists,
among whom was the late Professor
Joseph Le Conte of the University of
California.
After the doctors had decided that
Dunn was perfectly sane he was taken
to the office of the Board of Health
and there made application for en
trance to the Almshouse.
