Japan's household la expected to visit
the Japanese army in Korea soon. He
will personally represent the Emperor

SEOUL, Korea, June 3, 5 p. m.â It la
reported that 300 Cossacks are moving
on Plngyans from the "east coast ot
Korea. The nature of the country
through which the Cossacks must pass
practically prohibits travel except by
the regular roads, which at the best
are mere mountain trails.
While there Is no absolute"conflrma
tlon of the report that Japanese Minis
ter Hayashl is 1 1 visit Japan soon, yet
it is believed to be probable, as the
Japanese Government undoubtedly
wishes to consult him. Owing to hia
long diplomatic residence in Korea,
Minister Hayashl Is regarded as a
most competent authority on prevail
ing conditions In Seoul. The Japanese
legation has already submitted to the
home Government suggestions on a
future policy to be pursued by Japan
toward Korea.

The Dally Mail's correspondent at
Mukden, telegraphing under date of
June 3. says that fighting occurs dally
beyond Liaoyang. but that a decisive
battle is not expected for some time.
The Japanese plan of campaign is re
garded at Mukden as now having been
definitely disclosed. They occupy tho
Liaotung Peninsula in three divisions
between Nengalen (Nakwanling) and
Wafangtien. with a line of communica
tion by the coast to their position at
Fengwangcheng.
The Standard's Tokio correspondent
mentions the discredited rumor that
General Stoessel proposed a surrender
on the condition that the whole of tha
Port Arthur garrison should be permit
ted to retire to Newchwang under arms.
The Post's Shanghai correspondent
also says that General Mistchenko has
sent 4000 cavalry of the Imperial Guard
from Kuangchengtsu to cut off the
Japanese at Pitzwo. No great reliance,
however, should be placed on these dis
patches, which have evidently some
common Chinese origin.
LONDON, June 4. â A dispatch to the
Daily Express from Tokio says that
Field Marshal Yamagata has been ap
pointed commander in chief of all the

No further .light has been thrown on
the rumors concerning General Kuro
patkln's Intentions. Dispatches in the
Morning Post from Shanghai and to
the Chronicle from Newchwang repeat
the reports of the movement of 13.000
Russians to Kaiping. The correspond
ents assert that five days' fighting took
place at Wafangtien and ttat the Rus
sians are employing 4000 carts to re
move munitions from Liaoyang to Kal

KANSAS CITY, June 3.â Nine per

eastbound accommodation train, No. 36.
A messase received by officials here
ordered them to send a relief train
as soon as possible and to get all the
surgeons obtainable, from which it is
inferred that numerous passengers
were hurt. Newspaper men were not
permitted on the relief train, which left
about 11 o'clock to-night, and details
of the accident will not be learned until
the return of the train with the dead
ar.d injured.
Train No. 1, the Colorado flyer, had
orders to meet train No. 36, the ac
commodation, at Mastin. The crew, it
is believed, overlooked its, orders and
met train No. 36 south of Mastin tank,
about one and a third miles south of
Mastin. The engines were both large
and were demolished. Among the dead
is a tramp who was riding on the
"blind baggage." Baggageman Williams
on train 36 was injured and Engineer
Slocum on No. 1 has a broken leg.

ty-four German and Austrian boiler
makers, who were brought here by the
Santa Fe railway to work In the shops
in the places of the strikers, and who
were discharged when found incom
petent, left to-day for Los Angeles,
vowing that they would lay their cases
before the Consuls of their respective
nations in order to get the difference
in wages between what was paid them
and what they declare is due them
from the company. The men were
brought here from New York and
Pennsylvania and set to work in the
stockade, but had to be discharged in
a few days. .' They claim that the com
pany was to have paid them thirty
eight cents an hour and lhat some of
them got no more than twenty cents.
They further claim that some of thejn
were hired to work near Chicago and
others near Kansas City, but that once
aboard the cars guards were placed
over them and they were forcibly de
tained until they arrived at the local
stockade. They engaged an attorney
to sue the company, but local mer
chants visitedthe company offices with
them ' with the result .that the men
were tendered pay according to the
value of their ' services, which they
gladly accepted, although they gave no
receipts. Some -who expected top
wages as first-class mechanics were
-suspender makers and cloak makers.
When their incapacity was discovered,
they were made to "pile lumber and do
other menial work. -"
It was pointed out to ; them that a
suit would cost more . than they could
afford, while they would have to re
main here as witnesses during an in
definite length of time, whereupon they
left the city vowing to place the mat
ter in the hands of the Consuls.

NEWCHWANG, June 3, morning.â
Every 'effort on the part of the Rus

resulted in failure. The Japanese are
in control of all avenues of communica
tion and they allow no messages to
pass. With the exception of the au
thorities, the Russians' in Newchwang
are daily growing more depressed at
the outlook. One officer of high rank,
who has arrived here from Mukden,
spoke as follows concerning General
Kuropatkin.
"He is awaking to the fact that the
Japanese are worthy of praise." said
this officer. ."He declares- that'- their
recent operations prove them"* to be
among "the greatest strategists in -the
world," arid- to this must be added great
daring, capacity'* forwork? and ''ability
to stand punishment. The general did
not believe this before, but now it has
been demonstrated." Â» â¢ â¢ -.â¢Â¦

"The Award of the Alaskan Bound

Lansing, associate counsel before that
tribunal. Lansing said that while the
tribunal which brought to a conclusion j
the long dispute was not strictly one
of arbitration, it nevertheless partook
of that most important quality of ar

method of Judicial adjustment and de- i

of an award decisivelv in favor of one
government and decisively against the
other was a' great victory for those
principles of equity which shopld con

REDDING, June 3.â -Mrs. Anna Llt
trell died three years ago leaving a
flO.000 estate, and John J. Littrell, a
son, was appointed administrator on
the showing being made that there was
no will. He and a brother, Francis J.
Littrell, bought out the interests of
three "other children In the estate, as
all had shared alike in the distribution.
All went well until recently when Mrs.
Aiina Bidwell, a sister of the two men.
alleged in court that there was a will
and had John J. Littrell cited to ap
pear and produce the Instrument. The
hearing came up to-day and Francis
Littrell, who- recently fell out with his
brother John, took the stand and testi
fied that two days after their mother's
death he ' and John went over her
papers and found a will, by the terms
of which John was bequeathed but 55.
John took the will, he testified, and
he, the witness, had never seen it
since. For interests of his own, the
nature of which he did not confide to
the court, the witness kept the exist
ence of the will a secret, but said that
his conscience has been bothering him
and he wanted to make a clean breast
of the entire affair, even if he had to
go to State prison for.it.
John Littrell testified that Mrs. John
Littrell, his wife, was with Francis and
he when they went over their mother's
papers and that no will was found.
Mrs. John Littrell corroborated the
testimony of her husband.
Judge Head found at the conclusion
of the hearing that Mrs. Anna Littrell
had left a will, but that it is not in
possession of John Littrell, which
means that if the heirs who are anxious
to have the will produced can show
the contents of the Instrument they
may go ahead with the probating of
the document.
Reference to the Colorado strike sit

DENVER, Colo.. June 3.â The morn
ing session of the convention of the
Western Federation of Miners was
taken uÂ© in the discussion of the re

It provides that the executive boards*
of the American Federation of Labor
and the American Labor Union be
asked to Join with the Western Federa
tion of Miners in a conference for-amal
gamation. and that all national and
international labor organizations be in

conference. The call for this confer
ence will* be issued by the executive
board of the Western Federation of
Miners "at an opportune time."
The abolition of the transfer card was
brought up for consideration at the
afternoon session, and a heated debate
of nearly, two hours ensued. The cham
pions of the present system were united
in their opposition to any radical
change, and the delegates who held the
opposition were animated by a fervor
none the less genuine in their contention
that the method now in vogue be re
voked. A vote was at length taken, and
though a majority of the delegates put
themselves on record against the, trans
fer card, the constitutional two-thirds
was lacking. The old system will there
fore be maintained.

that all California needs is tp get her

ST. LOUIS, June 3.â A direct campaign
to secure customers and good prices for
what they already produce, as well as
new settlers, is to be made by two of
California's most Important counties,
Santa Clara and Fresno. These coun
ties will not rest satisfied with showing
their products as a lure to prospective
homeseekers, but will try to Increase
their prosperity through the palates of
World's Fair visitors. Charles F. Myer,
who represents Fresno, and Mr. Childs,
who acts in a like capacity for Santa
Clara, are turning their strongest ef
forts toward increasing the demand for
products. As yet the counties they rep
resent are not prepared to carry on
operations in a manner fulljr in conson
ance with their plans, but In a few
days visitors to the California section
will "be sampling Santa Clara prunes,
freshly cooked, and Fresno raisins, and
the other products of tree and vine in
these two countlea.
PRACTICAL COMMISSIONERS.
Commissioners Filcher and Wiggins
are greatly bothered by visitors, marjy
from California, who Insist that there
are exhibits in the State building.
There -are no exhibit* in that building.
The misconception is caused by an
erroneous statement in 'the first guide
book Issued by the exposition com
pany to the effect that an exhibit was
made In the State structure. The error
will be corrected in the new guide
book.
The Woman's Club of Alaska has
sent to the building of that Territory,
an exhibit of all the berries grown
within its bonders. There are fifteen
varieties, some of them new and all
luscious. Cereals and feed grasses
have also arrived. Red clover, four
feet high, and timothy, six feet high,
is shown. Many varieties of whejat,
oats, barley and rye are displayed;
also hemp.

The Territory makes mining her
principal display. It is to the rich
ness of ' her minerals that she looks
mainly for her future advance, Com
missioner Leatherwood says., A min
eral exhibit calculated to atract capi
tal is made. Its principal features are
gold, silver, copper and. lead ores.
September 22 .will be Arizona day
and it is thought a great many citizens
of the Territory, including Governor
Brady, will visit the fair on that date.
Arizona's display Will cost $30,000.
The fact that the bonds issued to se
cure this sum brought $2000 premium
speaks well for the credit of the Ter
ritory.
B. C. Samuels, the San Francisco
wine man, is here consulting Ferdi

wine display. This exhibit will be
ready in a few days and will fulfill all
expectations as to its beauty.

When her house in Berkeley was not
rented she lived in it. She seldom
spoke to any one except Mrs. Irwin.
Mrs. Calhoun was greatly embittered,
too, by the recent remarriage of t.er
husband, Charles Calhoun, from whom
the had been divorced after twenty
years of matrimony. Two sons were
born of this union, both of whom are
now living in Arizona. Â¦;'*'Â¦Â¦_
"I am almost sure I heard Mrs. Cal
houn calling for help," said Mrs. Irwin
this afternoon. "I thought it sounded
like 'Help! Fire!' I did not hear the
pistol shots."
The loss to the Kings through the
fire will amount to about $2000. The
Calhoun house was worth about $2000.
Mrs. Calhoun had recently mortgaged
it for $1700.
Of Mrs. Calhoun's movements lately
there is much mystery. She was a pe
culiar woman and lived almost alone.
She was morose, but that had been her
state for so long that it is not looked
upon as a reason why she should at
tempt suicide.
No one could be found to-day who
had actually seen Mrs. Calhoun within
a week. The rumor was spread ro-day
that she was ln*her house yesterday,
but this could not be confirmed. The
last definite information of her where
abouts came this afternoon from White
Sulphur Springs, near Vallejo, where
she said she intended going for two
weeks. She left there on Thursday.
Mrs. Calhoun spent" most of her time
in San Francisco. She gave elocution
lessons, and made her headquarters at
770 O'Farrell street. She was not at
this address when Inquiry was made
for her there this afternoon.
The charred remains of Mrs. Bertha
A. Calhoun may lie beneath the debris
of a house that was burned to the
ground at an early hour this morning.
She lived alone in the house, num
bered 2518 Telegraph avenue. Two pis
tol shots rang out Just before the fire
end this has led Mrs. Calhoun's neigh
bors to believe that she committed sui
cide after firing the house. A search of
the ruins to-day failed to reveal any
trace of the supposed victim.
There was a barn and a coal shed on
the property adjoining Mrs. Cal
houn's house, belonging to E. P. Ring,
and Robert Aggers, who was sleeping
in the barn, heard the two shots and
soon taw the flames. This was 2:30
o'clock this morning. Mrs. John Irwin,
a neighbor of Mrs. Calhoun's, thought
she distinguished the cries of a woman
calling for help. She told the firemen
about it. but the firemen could see
nothing of a woman in the flames.

After the exquisite solos by Mrs.
Richard Bane and a selection on the"
harp by Mrs. Voorhies, an informal re
ception followed.
The following named were the heroes
honored, many of .whom were unable
through infirmity to be present:
Out on California street, at the home
of Mrs. Alfred Hunter Voorhfes, there
gathered yesterday from many parts a
group of white-haired sens of the
Southâ they who fought " valiantlyâ
how well we, may afford to tell to-dayâ
in the cause they., believed to be Just.
For who is there now with soul so
warped as' to deny to these men their
full meed of praise for their magnifi
cent heroism and their voluntary sac
rifice of all that men hold dear in de
fense of that cause?
It was to commemorate the valor of
these men that wore the gray that they
gathered together yesterday, at the
Invitation of the Albert Sydney John
ston Chapter of the Daughters of the
Confederacy.
Yearly this pioneer chapter of daugh
ters of the South greets the veterans
of the Lost Cause and yearly place
upon their breasts crosses, of honor â
stamped from the cannon that belched
forth from the battlefields of the
South. And. it. was with no unseemly
spirit that the service attending the
tribute was carried out â no bitterness,
no untoward allusions, nor even a dis
play of Confederate flags.*-*
It was a simple tribute to men that
followed their line of duty as they,
themselves saw it, and to the world's
end will stujh.-men be honored, when
the mist of prejudice shall have cleared
away.
The speech of presentationâ and . a
pretty tribute it wasâ was made by;
Mrs. Voorhies, president of the chap
ter, who, by the way, knew well the
value of her words, her father at the
outset of the war resigning from the
United States Senate to' cast his lot
with his people. . -,
. The placing of the crosses on the
breasts of. the old warriors was the
pleasant duty of the wives and daugh
ters of the .veterans. . ; ~ . ,-.

DEAF PUPILS ENTERTAIN.
Children Once Considered Speechless
Show Successful Result of Training.
The, deaf children of the Harrison
School, .Grove, street, *near Larkln,
gave an entertainment yesterday af
ternoon, which was extremely clevor
and also gave those who attended th
privilege of noting the remarkable re
sults of a great system of teaching
"how to speak."
Children who had been considered
dumb proved by their ability to talk
that the patient labor of Mrs. J. B.
Holden,' Miss M. I. "Smith, Mlas N. M.
Applegarth and A. N. Holden haa
been well*, and" wonderfully rewarded.
Those who as yet are unable to speak
have been given the power of follow
ing and interpreting a conversation
by the movement of the lips.
The children appeared in sketches
called "Mother Goose Party" and
"May Day Festival" and, the excellent
training, was made evident by the
quick perception and keen intelli
gence and alertness of each cl\ild.
Mrs. Holden Â«aid yesterday that the
school during its three years' exist
ence had done useful work among the
deaf. She paid a high compliment to
the parents of the children for their
co-operation in the work. She par
ticularly Impressed upon the parents
present the necessity to talk to their
deaf children -in complete sentences
during the vacation.
There is no need for a- child -to-be
speechless, said Mrs. Holden; only
when the organ of speech is paralyzed
or diseased. Otherwise deaf children
can be taught .to speak.
The principal and her assistants
were congratulated by many a thank
ful mother at the close of the enter
tainment. '

Toodles and Me were at the Boys'
and Girls' Aid Society last night, and
they gave the inmates more fun than
they have had in years, and at the
same time convulsed the audienfie Tvith
laughter. The boys of the home are all
trying to become good citizens, but they
know a thing or two about the seamy
Bide of life, yet when they are given
a chance, as they were last night, to
portray that seamy side, they can do
it to perfectionâ and they did. Theat
rical managers would do well to look
to the society for future talent, for it
is there.
"Toodles and Me" was the minstrel
farce given by the boys as a matter of
entertainment in order to demonstrate
the work' which is being done in their
behalf, .in the way of education and
moral training. ., The, play was sup
posed to be an operetta which .. would
give an inkling of what was being ac

Â¦ Our people feel assured that they are Â«nlng
to receive every assistance from San Fran
cisco and California that they can render, and
with that assurance ae a foundation they wtll
give an exposition of which r.ot only the West
ern portion but the entire United States can
be proud. We know that every traveler who
comes to see the Lewis and Clark Centennial
Exposition will also visit San Francisco, and
what we hope to accomplish In working in
harmony with the commercial communities of
other Western cities u that all may be bene
fited.
San Francisco, while already a great city,
has a career before her which will he the mar
vel of the world, for on this site the time
lÂ« not fat distant when there will rise th*
third city In the United States, and Oregon ts
Just as much San Francisco territory as is thn
State of California. Our people would even
like to see San Francisco become greater than
New York, for we realize that as San Fran*
Cisco and California grow Portland and Ore
gon will reepond with equal strides, and thÂ«
chief city at the Junction of the WiUametto
and Columbia will share In any prosperity that
comes to the Pacific Coast.
Portland is especially Interested, for next
year she expects and Is prepared to receive and
entertain an enormous travel which will coma
there to attend the Lewis and Clark Centen
nial Exposition â one of the most beautiful and
exhaustive displays ever presented on Amer
ican soil.. Tha total cost of this exposition
will exceed five millions of dollars.
This exposition will be well worthy of thÂ«
entire Pacific Coast, and It is hoped by tha
people of Portland and Oregon that thÂ« people
of San Francisco and California will look
upon It as a home show, for It Is Just as vital
to San Francisco as It Is to Portland that
the exposition should be a ouccess. That it
will be creditable and a superb presentation Is
assured, for the money is already In hand to
carry out the complete undertaking on a cash
basis. Portland and Oregon displayed mar
velous enterprise and splendid liberality In
patting up one million dollars with less effort
that a similar population ever raised a lite
sum before. The truth of the matter Is, Port
land financed this great enterprlss In two
days, and the entire cltlxenship of the city and
State have determined that it shall be a suc
cess, and even the school boys and girls of
Portland are making It their duty and pleas
ure to advertise the event.
Thomas Richardson, manager of the
Commercial Club of Portland, Or., and
actively engaged in promotion work in
that State, is in this city for the pur
pose of attending a meeting of the
representatives of Western cities to
day. The meeting will be held at the
headquarters of the California Promo
tion Committee and will be for the 1
purpose of taking steps for immediate
work at St. Louis to get conventions
that are being held there now for this
coast in 1905. Mr. Richardson says:
There is no good reason why' ail the com
mercial organizations in the cities from the
Rocky Mountains west should not unite In
the effort to secure for Pacific Coast cities for
IOCS the convention held this year In St. LouiÂ«.
and . the conference held â¢ here under the aus
pices of the California Promotion Commutes
cannot be otherwise than beneficial.-

The annual report of the president
and superintendent of the Central Eu
reka mine In Amador County has been
submitted. One of the most interest-
Ing portions is over the signature of E.
B. de Golla, the president, in which he
reports that a contract for ten years
has been concluded by which the cost
of electrical power to run the mill and
rock breaker has been reduced per
horsepower from J6 60 per month to
$4 &0. The dividends declared during
the year amounted to $111,350. The
total disbursements were $280,000 ' in
round figures. All bills to April 1 were
reported to be paid and there was
$19,000 in- cash' on hand. The average
yield of the ore per ton during the year
was $4 41. The cost of milling, mining
and- development work per ton aver
aged $2 36, The mine is . reported to
have yielded nearly $1,000,000 since the
present management .took hold of it
and has paid . out nearly $300,000 in
dividends. This is distinctly a low
grade proposition in which good man
agement and economy are efficacious.
' . The . Redding. Searchlight reports
that . there ,1s : a prospect of renewed
mining activity at Trinity Center. The
Sikes hydraulic mine, the Bloss & Mc-
Clary /mine and the Cleary, Payne &
Keenan gold mining dredge, are op
erating.
Â¦ San Joaquin County is Interested in
a home gold mining proposition. From
the eastern boundary of San Joaquin
the.Mokelumne River has gold bearing
sand for a considerable distance down
stream. The great difficulty has been
to get at the deeper anJ richer depos
its. At Jenny Llnd a dredger has been
delving for gold for some time.

An interesting account of the re
vival of the mining town of # Rands
burg, on the. desert, in Kern County, is
given- by the Randsburg Miner. It il
lustrates the vitality that there is in a
California mining camp' that has really
any value in it/ A part of the Miner's
story. is as follows: . .
One year ago next Saturday, the last disas
trous fire > occurred In Randsburg. This was
the third time the larger portion of the town
was destroyed Â¦ by . fire, and It looked discour
aging. Â¦ The " strike coming immediately after
paralyzed everything, all work being shut down
for some months. .The mines yet remained and
their value could i not be destroyed. The old
residents and mine owners took courage, new
and safer houses *.werÂ« built,, many men took
leases and went to work. To-day the outlook
is again bright and the future of the camp is
assured. 1 The Tollow "Aster, the principal
mine here, la working a full force. -both their
mills are > running and they have more men on
their pay roll than. ever before.' Their thirty
stamp, mill was closed down' a few day* for
necessary, repairs, a new cable was. bent, and
other repairs made, but It was only Idle a few
days and is now running. ':.-.'Â¦Â¦ ' :
The Butte Lode, under, the management of
Superintendent McMahon. Is making its usual
millings with about the same results, and is
prosperous. . . Nearly or quite all the other
principal mines In the district are working a
full force and doing well; the. Baltic, Stanford,
Sunshine and others. v The White brothers are
developing a property about seven -miles south
west of Randsburg, and,, taken altogether, the
mining prospect Is good. ''i-iP?3
In the town are many new and costly bulld-
With untold wealth beneath'the surface, only
awaiting the pick and ehovel of the miner to
develop it, Randsburg will soon again be re
built; the camp being without question the
richest in Southern California. We have al
ways had a superior class of miners and clti
sens here, and while not so well acquainted as
formerly, from what, we .have observed In the
past few days we believe the same Is true to
day. It only needs united effort to put Rands
burg thoroughly upon her feet.
An interesting situation has developed In
the recently discovered oil fields in the Car
son sink. Churchill County, Nevada. Pros
pectors, quickly following the discovery of
oil. located a large area of the adjacent lands
under the placer location act, as provided by
law. The hydrographlc branch of the United
States Geological Survey is engaged in ex
tensive reclamation of desert Ianda. This is
the outgrowth of the investigations made dur
ing the early years of the survey, when under
the 'direction of J. W. Powell. These projects
are located throughout the Western States.
The lands which it is Intended to reclaim by
irrigation methods have been withdrawn from
all entry except under the homestead act, it
being the. desire of the Government that these
lands be taken up in small farming tracts,
not exceeding 160 acres for each person who
may make such entry, and the tract in Nevada
where oil was recently discovered chances to
bÂ» within one of these reclamation areas. As
the value of the land for the oil it may pro
duce is unknown. . and as without Irrigation
it is practically valueless for any other pur
pose, the Government may possibly make an
exception in this case and allow the original
locators to hold their oil claims, for it seems
unjust that the original claimants should be
dispossessed of their locations of twenty acres
each in favor of later locators appropriating
160 acres each, and who at their option may
also bora for oil. ' Notices have been posted
informing oil locators that the land ts not
subject tn location In any manner other than
as homestead tracts.
An odd situation affecting oil men
in Nevada has arisen. It grows out
of somewhat novel . conditions. The
case is stated by the Mining and Sci
entific Press as follows:
bond, the Masonic Bar hydraulic mine
to Edwin L. Hyatt and L. H. Cornell.
The Shasta Courier reports some
movement among the miners near Old
Shasta. Clear Creek is. a quiet camp,
but all that is needed is capital to de
velop the properties. The Mount
Shasta mine remains closed. Just to
the west of this mine are the Pugh
and Menzel -groups of mines and to
the north is the Keno group. On the
Menzel group development work is
being performed. The Courier says:
Abov e and northwest Parmley, Glad win and
otheratare hard at work on the Mountain Lion
mine. This group embraces a number of
lodes and Is part of a system of high grade
ledges. On the Shasta side Early â¢ brothers
arc driving . their tunnel Into the hill on a
good . prospect. The Oro Flno, opened by
Bthrena, also adjoining thÂ« Mount Shasta,
has ore in sight Beaumont U driving ahead
on the old Bouk mine. West of Clear Creek
Dickey is pushing work on his tunnel. He Is
in over 300 feet. Farther west lies the Con
nerÂ» group. Negotiations for a sale of this
mine are pending. ' The Spanish at Lower
Springs is closed down. Superintendent Davis
was transferred by Manager Newcomb to the
Punch Creek group recently secured by the
company. The mine, which is west of Treka,
is under the direction of H. C. Davis. About
fifteen men art employed.- The Bpantsh is
receiving timbers, however. Indicating a re
sumption of work here later on. The Crown
Deep is shipping ore to the smelter. . The
Wiser boys are opening up a big mine on
the old Muchmore claim. ! In the creek below
you can pick up plenty of quarts showing
gold. James Sallee has taken a bond on the
Keid mine at Old Diggings. .:

The suit for divorce of Jennie Clyde
Harner against W. B. Harner, a rail
road official, has brought forth an an
swer and cross-complaint ' from her
spouse. Karner denies specifically all
her charges of cruelty. He says he did
not poison her dog, as she claims, but
admits that he did say to her that if
she showed him one fraction of the- at
tention she showered upon the canine
he would be a much happier man.
Harner says he wanted to get rid of
the animal, and once suggested to his
wife that she send it to a hospital. or
a sanitarium, agreeing at the same
time to pay for its keep there. He says
she refused to comply with his wishes
and persisted in having the pet always
about her, and allowed it to run about
the house and damage the furniture.
Harner also complains of his wife's
temper. He says she loses It without
provocation and that on morethan one
occasion she has attacked him. Once,
he says, in order that he might not be
scratched and clawed beyond recogni
tion by her he had to take her and
hold her on a lounge until she got over
the paroxysm. He also says that he
was greatly humiliated by Mrs. Harner
at a dinner party at their home when
Reed was not present in ,. court,
though he had answered his wife's suit
with a general denial of her charge of
desertion. He was represented, how
ever, by Attorney A. Ruef, while
Colonel Kowalsky appeared on behalf
of the plaintiff.
Mrs. Reed's complaint charged that
Reed deserted her in the latter part o*
1902. They v.-ere married in this city in
May, 1894. No children were born to
them. â¢
George W. Reed, a well-known and
wealthy coffee merchant, is minus a
wife, $12,500 in cash and four valuable
pieces of realty on Washington "and
Jackson streets, . between Locust and
Spruce, as the result of a suit for a di
vorce filed against him by Nellie ReÂ«d.
Her suit was heard yesterday by
Judge Troutt and at the close of the
hearing the court signed a decree giv
ing her a divorce on the ground of de
sertion and also affixed his signature
to findings containing a stipulation
signed by Reed in which he agreed to
give Mrs! Reed $12,500 in cash and four
pieces of realty provided she would
waive all other claims ?he might have
against him for alimony and counsel
fees. â¢. .- ;
The coyote, the coward of beasta,
usually more willing to run than fl%ht,
fought a desperate battle with a man
, on hills of Toint Reyes a few days ago.
1 As a result Corporal P. McGee of the
Central ro'.lce station bears an ugly.
scar on one side of his face and head,
the marks of the coyote's teeth.
McGee was at Point Reyes "on a va
cation. With Marln County's Deputy
Sheriff, Thomas Irving, and George W.
Phelan, McGee started a half-dozen
hounds on a coyote hunt. Finally one
of the foremost canines caugHt the
scent of the "desert scavenger."
McGee tcok a short cut to head off
the gray-haired beast,' and remarked
to his friends that he would catch the
coyote in his arms. He was standing
on the brink of a bluff. Suddenly the
hunter felt something strike him on the
left side. He clutched the object, lost
his balancer and fell to the bottom of
the cliff, clutching a great shaggy coy
ote. McGee fought to disentangle him
self from the unwelcome affinity. The
coyote bit. clawed and fought with
great viciousness. The animal cut a
gash four inches long in the face and
head of the unfortunate hunter -and
made its escape. McGee," though
wounded, seised his rifle and shot the
coyote before it got away. The dead
animal was- pronounced one of the big
gest ever seen in Marin County. It was
as large as a great St. Bernard and
had tusks two and a half inches long.
McGee was taken into Point Reyes
station and his wounds were dressed.
The injured corporal is now the hero
of the Central station; being the only
riren there with the record of a wild
beast fighter.
The newly created executive commit
tee of the Republican State Central
Committee will meet this evening at
party headquarters in the Palace Hotel
and probably select a chairman of the
general body. There is no fight on for
the position. It is understood, how
ever, that General George Stone, who
was at the head of the Republican
State Committee In the memorable
McKlnley campaign of 1900, Is willing
to serve the party again. State Senator
Tncmas Flint of RÂ»i Benito, an or
ganiser of exceptional ability and ex
perience, stands ready to accept the re
sponsibility of the chairmanship. Oth
ers equally capable are spoken of.
It is quite well understood that the
chairman, whoever he may be, will
make a SDecial effort to win for the
party every Congressional district of
California. Theodore Roosevelt, the
Republican nominee for President, will
receive a tremendous majority. The
victory, however, will be incomplete In
the event of failure to elect a solid Re
publican Congressional delegation. The
old First District was once lost to the
Republicans by the indifference of the
State Central Committee to the candi
deey of John A. Barham.
Signs indicate that the Democrats of
the Second Congressional District in
tend to adopt the tactics of De Vries/
who went before the voters with a
Democratic nomination on a Democrat
ic platform aad won his election
by making stra!?ht-out Republican
speeches. Duncan E. McKinlay of So
norr.a County will in all probability be
the Republican nominee for Congress
5n the Second. He is a campaigner of
exceptional merit and enterprise and a
Republican of unswerving loyalty. In
all the Dolltical campaigns since 1892
he has carried the standard of his par
ty as one of the leading speakers of
the Republican State Committee. He
is known and honored in every county
and town in California. If he is nom
inated he will let the voters of the Sec
ond know that he !s the only Repub
lican nominee for Congress in that dis
trict. When elected he will be able,
with the assistance of his fellow Repre
sentatives of Republican sentiment, to
accomplish something for the people of
his district.

CONGRESSIONAL BATTLE
SPRIXOFIEXD. m, JanÂ© 3.â By
mating a combination with Charles S.
Deneen, I*. T. Sherman, Howland J.
Harnlin and John H. Pierce. Governor
Yates to-day broke the deadlock In the
Republican State Convention and
brought about the nomination of De
neen for Governor. The nomination was
made on the seventy-ninth ballot,
which stood: Tates l, v Lowden 622*4,
Deneen 957U, Warner 31.
The combination waa the result of a
series of conferences which were held
last night and this morning and which
were participated In by Yates, Deneen,
Hamlin, Sherman and Pierce. The
agreement had not been consummated
when the convention met at 10 o'clock
this morning, and the Yates and De
neen people forced a recess until 2 p. m.
Then the parties to the combination
met and finally agreed upon Deneen as
the candidate. When the convention
reconvened Tates, Hamlin and Sher
man withdrew their names from the
consideration of the delegates, and
urged their friends to vote for Deneen.
"When the seventy-ninth rollcall was
ordered and Adams County led off with
"one vote for Yates and nineteen for
Deneen" the wildest excitement pre
vailed. As the call proceeded it became
evident that the new combination
would win, but the original Lowden
men for the most part remained firm
and went to defeat with him. When the
call was completed Lowden moved to
make the nomination unanimous, and
Chairman Cannon declared the motion
carried. All of the pent-up enthusiasm
of the delegates manifested Itself as
Deneen came to the platform and
briefly thanked the convention for the
honor. In response to the demands of
the assemblage Colonel Lowden made
an address, pledging his support to the
ticket.
The convention then took up the nom
ination of a candidate for Lieutenant
Governor, but the 'leaders of the new
combination were not prepared for this,
and a recess/ was taken until 3 p. m.
In the meantime the parties to the
combination which had nominated De
neen met at the executive mansion and
prepared a slate for the remainder of
the ticket.
The ticket was completed at the night
session as f (Slows:
Lieutenant Governor, L. I. Sherman.
Secretary of State, James A. Rose
(incumbent).
State Treasurer. Len Small.
State Auditor, Joseph S. McCullough
(incumbent).
Attorney General, W. H. Stead.
University Trustees, Mrs. Mary T.
Bussey, Charles Davidson and W. L.
Abbott.
The ticket went through according to
the slate agreed upon at the executive
mansion conference, except in the case
of B. M. Chipperfleld, 'whom W. H.
Stead defeated for Attorney General.
At 11:40 o'clock the convention ad
journed sine die.

DE. PIEBCE'S REMEDIES.
"I last courmom mnd thought I
mrould msrer rmgmia my health."
"Three years of delicate health
trying doctors' prescriptions and
patent medicines" without benefit
might well sap the courage of any
woniso. And yet Mrs. Ery ant proved
that the question of the cure of worn-
anly disease is only a question of
using the right remedj. A few doses
of 'Favorite Prescription' restored
her courage and revived her hope,
because roe could see "a decided
change from the Â£Â«*." Three
months' use of the medicine re-
stored her to perfect health.
Dr. Pierce's Favorite Prescription
cures irregularity, dries â¢weakening
drains, heals inflammation and â¢ ul-
ceration, and cures female weakness.
Mrs. Sarah Errant, President of Mfmpiii
Social Science Club, residing at 171 Atkinson
Avr,. Memphis. Tena.. writes: "I sufcrrt-d
with delicate health for three years, trying
doctors' prescriptions and | patent medicines
until I lost courage and thocrht I would
serer regain my health; but a lew doses of
yoer 'Favorite Prescription* made me chan ge
my mind. Could see a decided change from
the first, so I kept on taking it for three
months faithfully and am now in perfect
health."

EVENTS IN SOCIETY
Just when Mrs. Hearst had been im
posed upon and how. Miss Sherlock re
fused to say. Mrs. Hearst does not in
tend to take back the property she has
already given to her benefactions.
"Mrs. Hearst did not withdraw her
benefactions on account of financial
losses," Miss Sherlock said to-day,
"but because she discovered that she
had been imposed upon. She therefore
decided to cut off all her contributions
at one time."
Miss Margaret Sherlock, resident
Â¦worker at the social settlement, gives
as authoritative statement as to the
reason for Mrs. Hearst's sudden de
termination to cease her gifts.

2HS Center Street, June X
Certain people have been imposing
on the generosity of Mrs. Phoebe A.
Hearst, and that is why she nas with
drawn some of her benefactions at the
University of California. This" is the
first light thrown on the interesting
Question.
The grip was not Selby's. The police
believe Ferro's explanation. He has
been in the Southern Pacific Company's
employ for twenty-seven years and
bears an tellent reputation.
David F.Selby,!. of the llrm of Selby
Bros., candy manufacturers of Oak
land' and San Francisco, who lest
a grip containing $1600 Tuesday after
noon while on the way to'. San Fran
cisco, swore out a; search warrant upon
which the residences of. Joseph Ferro.
370 A street, and John Lee, 333 Louisa
street, were - searched -last night by
detectives, who found a bag in Ferro'a
house, -that contained J130O 50. Ferro
ahd^Lee are porters on the ferry boat
Piedmont. Selby claims he was in
formed that they had been seen to pick
up; a grip on th& boat the afternoon
Selby lost his 'coin.
' Proceedings in Judge Samuels' court
were continued thts morning for a week
after some testimony had been taken.
' Ferro declares that the money found
by the police has been in his possession
for a year; that it belongs to three
minor children of a John Williams, de
ceased, of. whom Ferro is guardian and
that the money was paid as back pen
sion to Williams. Ferro insists that
he has ample evidence to prove that
the coin ' has been in his hands for
months. With the money were found
documents showing that Ferro did re
ceive a sum equal to that in the grip
from the United States Government.
J. H. Shepard, a pension attorney,
corroborates Ferro's story and says he
knows the money was from the United
States Government as he prosecuted
Williams' claim. Shepard declares that
Ferro was afraid to putlthe money in
a bank.

Associated Charities Affairs.
The council of the Associated
Charities met yesterday, when the
finance committee suggested various
plans for the collection of this year's
income. Each member was asked to
make himself responsible for $100.
Fairfax Wheelan announced that $2400
would be needed in addition to the
society's income to carry out the work
this year. The income had been large
ly lncreasedT but not sufficient to keep
up with the growth of the society.
Miss Kate Atkinson and Mrs. Thomas
Richardson were elected, to till va
cancies in, the council. The society
voted to raise a sum not to exceed $300
as a special fund for needy children
not provided for by other agencies.

The marine insurance world is begin
ning to show some anxiety for the
safety of the "British ship Leylan.i
Bros., which is making an exceedingly
long passage from Newcastle, Austra
lia, for Salina Cruz.' Salina Cruz is dif
ficult of access for calling vessels and
the Leyland is not the kind of ship to
make much progress in the light airs
so frequent in the region of her desti
nation. She is a stout, well-formed*
vessel and capable of ' weathering any
kind of storm likely to beset hei path.
She Is loaded, however, with coal, and
the always present danger of spon
taneous " combustion grows with the
length of the voyage.
The Leyland Bros, has been at sea
132 days and yesterday the rate of re
insurance paid on her was advanced to
30 per cent. She is a vessel of 2238 tons
register, was built In 1S86 at Southamp
ton and is well known at this port.
The Conemaugh is now considered a
hopeless risk. She is out ninety-seven
days from Caronel for New Tork.
Conemaugh and Lamorna are quoted
at 10 per cent. The rate on the Laura
remains at 75 per cent and the Crown
of Germany at. 10 per cent. The Juteop
clis. Wynford, Queen Elizabeth La
Rochefoucauld, Largo Law and Willy
Rickmers are still quoted at 7 per cent.
BARKENTIXE CORONADO A.VD THE BARK OLYMPIC. WHICH ARRIVED YESTERDAY FROM HAWAIIAN PORTS WITH

Business men are complaining be
ca,use â¢ the Southern Pacific Company
exacts payment for State tolls on ship
ments cf gooda, passing over the coast
division cf the company, in which the
trade cf this city Is concerned.
A State toll has long t>een levied by
tbÂ« Harbor Commissioners ct* goods
that cress the wharves or the State in
Ban. Francisco. The purpose is to pro
vide money for the maintenance of the
wharves. There are no State wharves
en the coast division of the Southern
Paci5c Coir.pany and tne freights on
that division, consequently, travel ever
cone of the State property. The mer
chants are inquiring concerning the
destination cf the money collected by
the railroad people for State tolls on
the coast line. In a year it amounts
to a large euci.
After some consideration a commit
tee has been appointed to inquire into
the entire subject. There is no ques
tion that tie charge is uniformly ir.ade
upon the shipments by the coast divi
sion. The f relent bills received by. the
merchants supply evidence on that
poist.
The stirring up of the question cf
State tolls may have consequences of
wide sccpe. The public is interested,
but r.ot more keenly than is the Santa
Fe Railroad Company. The toll that is
collectea on the coast divisicm is five
cents per ton, cr one %xni for each
400 pounds or fraction thereof. This is
the same rate as that collected on the
wharves. If the coast division of the
Southern PaciSc Company did not make
charge for State toll, so Jt Is assumed.
it would have an advantage in moving
freight to the amount of about one
dollar per carload.
Its adi-antage would be to the cor
respoading disadvantage of the Santa
Fe and. in the long run. would result
in giving the coast division a large
freight traszoets. A report may soon
be received from the committee that is
making the investigation into State
tells.
Judge Cook adjudged Detectives
Dinan and Wren guilty of contempt
yesterday and formally laid down rules
to the effect that a prisoner after be
ing discharged- on a writ of habeas
corpus 'must \ not be reaxrested within
the confines of the Hall of Justice, and
that they must not withhold from the
court any information they have
against a prisoner.
"The Judge's, action was due to the
arrest of William B. Kennedy, alias |
Richard Jackson, alias "Yellow," one Â¦
of the thugs arrested for the murder!
of Policeman Eugene C. Robinson on i
the morning of January 21, 1902, after !
his discharge on Thursday on a wriy
of habeas corpus. The arresting of
ficers were Detectives Dinan and Wren.
They and Frank H. Norman, clerk to
the Chief of Police, were cited to ap
pear for contempt of court.
When the case was taken up yester
day morning Assistant District Attor
ney Harris filed the answer of the re
spondents, Dinan and Wren, to the ef
fect that the* arrest was made outside
the courtroom; that it was not made
In flagrant violation of any order of
court, but was made after court had
adjourned, for a felony. Clerk Xotman
denied . that he advised the arrest of
Kennedy and was purged of contempt.
The Judge said the courthouse was
the courtroom, and that the passage
way into the courtroom was as much
a part of the courtroom as the court
room itself. In the Kennedy case an
order had been made asking the police
if they had any cause to show why the
prisoner, should not be discharged, and
they had answered in the negative. One
of the respondents was in court and
the other was standing at the door
waiting for the result of the habeas
corpus proceedings before arresting the
defendant. If they had made their in
tention known to the court the prisoner
would have been discharged and could
then have been rearrested. It was
trifling with the court to withhold that
information.
Dinan and.Wren were called and they
testified that they had no Intention of
violating the order of the court. There
was a direct contradiction between
Wren and Attorney Newberg. and
Wren threatens to have Newberg ar
rested for perjury.
The Judge eald that If the police had
cause for holding the prisoner It
should have been made known at the
time of the hearing., The fine would be
merely nominal, but If anything of the
kind happened again It would be con
sidered a flagrant contempt of court.
He would convict the respondents,
Dinan and Wren, of contempt and
would fine them $1 each. A stay of
thirty days was granted, as an appeal
may be taken to the Supreme Court.

In London a banking combination
is now in progress that will put the
two largest New York banks far j in
the background. This is the comblna-,

District Banking Company, Limited.
The new combined London bank:^will
be the largest banking institution in
the world, and will overshadow even
the big Government banks, like the

first used by a Mr. Murdoch of Soho.
near Birmingham, England, in 1792.
His house and offices at Redruth were

of these two writers is of about as op

over, omniscience is rather a hobby
with Mr. Lang, and it evidently piques
him that he cannot understand the lan

of Oxford and Cambridge. , Starting
with Mr. /Â«le's remark that "the Eng

Lang unfolds his ignorance of the
American language in this wise:
"Beginning with the adventure of the
English tourist,- we learn that 'the
clothes he wore evidently had been cut
from a steamer rug by his mother, or
some other aged relative suffering from
astigmatism.' The nature of a steamer
rug is not obvious, for perhaps 'steam

WYOMING is the last State to take the strug

the deserts as his "commissioners" in Pullmans that he
stocked from sheets to toothpicks, and all the world
seemed wishing to enlist under his banner aud personally
conduct him to the White House. Now he has no trains
nor commissioners on the road, an{T is not even furnish

only' life- seen and the only pulse felt in his J campaign
was the encounter between his supporters, Mr." Tarpey
and ex-Governor Budd, in, the Palace Grill, in which
fists were doubled and language was used unfit in the
presence of the innocent lamb chops: which were part of
the lunch at which the affair occurred. The exÂ»Governor
made unpleasant references to the Hearst sack, and
Tarpey to the .ex-Governor's credit' being so ill that he

To wake at morn
And hear the matin song
Of the sea breeze in the palms;
To watch at daton
The rising sunbeams kiss
The mist-crowned, towering peaks
And glide down to the plainsâ
Ah, that is Life!
Not this â
To wake at morn
And hear the swelling roar
Of man, beast and machine,
Toiling in a murky air
And a city's sweat!
At noon to dream
Where Nature's bowers are hid
Beneath an arch
Of twined and intersticlng vines
While on the air
Quivers the chanting of the sighing

And the songs of mating birds â
Ah. that is Life!
At noon to pause
And lay aside the pen for one brief hour.

Physical culture has a great charm for
Mr. White, who goes in for it rather
strongly. In November, 1S99, he was
the winner of the Sandow medal for
physical culture. It was when first in
Paris two years ago that M. Rodin
complimented Mr. White upon his
beautiful figure and eventually .asked
him to be his model, with the result
that almost at once Mr. White gave up
a good des.1 of his time to posing in
Rodin's studio. Off and on for two
years Mr. White has been posing and
*<o pleased is M. Rodin at the way the
young American has "stuck" to this
somewhat tedious business that the
sculptor desires to give him a bronze
cast of the figure he is now making,
and which is to be exhibited at the St.
Louis Exposition. Since first posing
for M. Rodin Mr. White, who is much
interested in art, has made a tour of
the world, starting from Paris. In
Japan, especially, his beautiful figure
attracted tremendous attention.
Although acknowledging that posing
is tiring work, Mr. White finds much
pleasure in being in M. Rodin's studio,
Â¦where he rays the master himself
â¢works very hard. He models first In
clay, altering frequently, both by add
ing and taking axray. Mr. White also
is much impressed with Rodin's child
like manner.
Rodin being at the moment out of
France while placing his works in dif
ferent exhibitions. Mr. White is taking
this opportunity to leave Paris for a
short tour in Spain- He Intends visit
ing Madrid. Toledo. Cordova and Se
ville. Before long, however, both the
sculptor and his amateur model expect
tÂ» be back in Paris again and working
in the atelier. Â»
India and Tibet.
In an article in the June number of
the North American Review, Sir Wal
ter Lawrence, who until lately was
private secretary to the Viceroy of In
dia, explains the object of "The British
Mission to Tibet." British India may
be likened, as Lord Curzon has likened
it, to a fortress, with the sea as a moat
on two sides, and mountains for walls
on the third: beyond the walls is a
glacis, of varying breadth and di
mensions. The British do not
want to occupy this glacis, but
they cannot afford to see . it oc
cupied by a foe. They are quite con
tent that it should remain In the hands
of allies and friends, but, if unfriendly
influences creep up- and lodge under
their walls, they ,are compelled to in
tervene, because danger would thereby
grow up and menace their^ security.
This is the secret of the British atti
tude toward Tibet, where of late Rus-
Eia has been attempting to make her
influence paramount. Sir Walter Law
rence argues that inaction might havÂ«
injuriously affected British relations
with other peoples:
"The contumacy," and wanton neglect
of treaty obligations, which we have
experienced at the hands of the evasive
and intangible Government of Lhasa
for the last fifteen years, have not con
duced to enhance our prestige on the
northeast frontiers' of India. It was
possible that the contemptuous treat
ment of the Viceroy's letters returned
from I/iasa unopened might, if unno
ticed, have been followed by further In
sult, and in the East the spirit of contu
macy is catching. British relations with
Nepal are of the most satisfactory
nature, and it is of first importance
that they should continue so. For Ne
pal, strategically, is the very keystone
of the Indian frontier, and is one of
our most important recruiting grounds,
for it is from Nepal that we obtain our
brave little Gurkhas, who with the
Sikhs form the backbone of our Indian
army. And it Is ,not improbable that,
if we had gone on meekly acquiescing
In- the ridiculous : attitude of Tibet,
Nepal might have had doubts as to our
real power, anc the . thought might
have arisen that the policy adopted by
Tibet might -equally well be followed in
Nepal. Ideas spread with fatal rapid
ity in India, and all roads lead to
Lhasa. A few years more of forbear
ance, and Bhutan and Burma might be
taking a leaf^ out 1 of the book, of the
Dalai Lama."

The Channel Tunnel.
The English channel tunnel proj
ect may be revived as one of the re
sults of the Anglo-French agreement.
At any rate, M. Cambon, the French
Embassador, has recently Indulged in
some hopeful utterances on the sub
ject and M. Duche, President of the
French Chamber of Commerce, re
cently declared to a representative of
the London Express that the comple
tion of a tunnel from Dover to Calais
should be one of the results of the
"entente cordiale." It may be forgot
ten that the tunnel has been begun,
about 100 yards on each side having
been constructed, when operations
were stopped by changes which unex
pectedly occurred in the English pol
,icy some time ago. M. Carnbon said:
"The question remains of as great ac
tual interest as ever, and the advan
tages to the trade of both countries
which would result from the realiza
tion of the project are, very, clear, in
deed." M. Deloncle, president of ths
Parliamentary group interested in for
eign trade, is quoted as saying: "No
progress, however important it might
be, would be of so much value to the
two countries as the establishment of
a tunnel between Calais and Dover."
The Express adds that it is nearly
fifty years since the tunnel project
was first placed upon a practical ba
sis of experiment,' but since then the
original estimate has been reduced
from 550,000.000 to $20,000,000.

PARIS. May 22. â Here is the latest

the Journey of life, was struck down
by a locomotive and killed. No weird
Indian rites marked his funeral ser
\'ice and not a single redskin looked
upon his still face. He Kad been known
in life as the "Squaw Man," an ap
pellation of cowardice, and he died aa
he lived, an outcast to all tribes,
branded and unpardoned.
In the early sixties Mayor Ormsby.
located at Carson, learned that the In
dians were murdering the whites in
the vicinity of Pyramid Lake. With
a little band of men he started for
Wads worth and a day later met the
savage foe and engaged them in battle,
with the result that Ormsby ana nearly
all of his frontiersmen fell on the field.
"When the battle began the Indian,
whom death claimed last week, ran
from the shower of lead. For this of
fense he was deprived of his own name
and dubbed "Squaw Man." He was
attired in squaw's clothing and his
family taken from him. His tribe os
tracized him, all the Indians avoided
him and the stigma -was never re
moved. A few years ago he doffed the
feminine garments, but his sin was
never pardoned and he never returned
from the exile to which his cowardice
had condemned him.
TO-MORROW The Sunday Call's Summer Fiction
Number, will appear. It will be important for the.
long list of notable writers who have .contributed
some of their best stories to its pages.
.Norman Duncan, a writer .new to The Sunday Call,
has written "The Strength of Men,"; exclusively for this
edition. It will be surprising even . to those who read
his "Fruits of Toil" in the Sunday Call a week or two
ago, for powerful, weird, awe-inspiring as that latter tale
was, it had none of the sweep of the elements, the terror
of the unknown, the fine stoicism in the face of inexorable
fate or the depth of human hatred or the height of human
love that is shown in this new work. It is a/story to
show men what .real men; are, while to those of the
gentler sex, who hold strong opinions as to which love
deepest and bestâ men or womenâ it will be a revelation.
Those who have, been reading Frank H. Spearman's
new series of railroad stories now running in The Sun
day. Call have doubtless. noticed that while each story is
complete in itself, the series- as a whole, make up a
connected history of the building and the reorganization
rnd reconstruction of a great Western railroad* with.all
the- difficulties that have to be contended with in a- virgin
country of precipitous mountains and blizzard swept
plains, while in the web and woof of each story are the
secrets and the science of railroading of which even the
experienced traveler learns little.
The story of "Soda Water Sal" makes a sky-scraping
locomotive almost ' a living, breathing creature of brain
and sinews, while there is something pathetic in "the
seemingly artless pitting of father against son in one of
those midnight adventures which, only the railroad man
â and the train dispatcher â may live through once, but
never again.
But from the essentially modern, intensely exciting
railroad stories of Spearman to the sawdust ring and the
flying trapeze of Alec Bruce's tales- may be considered a
far cry, yet is there the spirit of practical up-to-date
enterprise and managerial sharpness shown in "The Price
of a Threat" by, the -latter author, which makes this
tragic talc with a delightful ending less an overwrought
fiction than a simple record of fact. - The four-cornered
struggle between the giant and the beautiful little, eques
trienne on the one hand and the pathetic clown and the
little circus imp on the other is truly unique and start
ling even in circus stories. It raises a lump in the reader's*
throat only to cause, him to gulp it down with a side
s.'itting laugh over the very last line.
However, it is not possible, to outline every story in
The Sunday CalKs Summer Fiction Number to-morrow
even in brief. A few of the titles and the authors' names
Will be sufficient to show its wide scope and the'attrac
tive diversity of every page, though specially clever is
Jerome K. Jerome's witty and caustic article on "The
American Girl's Etiquette," while "The Crimson Vis
icned Cow,'" by Edwin J. WcDSter, is weird and amusing
to a ludicrous decree.
"Bending the Twig" is a new and particularly apt
"fable for the foolish," which is of the order of witticism
that is broadly quoted; while exceptionally dainty and.
finished are the "half-hour storiettes" â "Shadows," by
Hartly Willard; "A .Will and a Way," by Martha Mc-
Culloch Williams; "Doctor Thornton's Failure," by Otho
B. Senga; "Over the Sea," by Kate Cleary; "His Train
ing,'' by Harry Preston; "Cherries," by John Bridges;
"By the Hand of Providence," by Keith Gordon" etc, etc.
Still there are many other articles of quite a different
sort for those to whom fiction, even by world-famous
authors, does not appeal. For instance, there is "Across
the Pacific on an Oceanic Liner," bv Bert Levy, who is
noted as Australia's foremost artist, particularly -for his
Jewish pictures. He has illustrated his own article with
'.some of his clever pen work. Then there is "The Oddest
Plouse in California,", by Albert Dezendorf; "Dangers
of the Hero Behind the Bat." by Frank Morehousc; "The
-War-Time Girl," by Augusta Prescott; "The Fashionable
Summer Hats for Men," by Tom Dillon; "The Training
, of Children,*' by William J. Shearer; "The Equestrian
Girl and Her Hair," by Madge Moore;John McLaren,

Titâ¬ suicide of the Mayor of Baltimore may^be viewed as

A Cork Game.
A neatly dressed stranger drifted
into a downtown saloon a few even
ings ago and invited all liands to join
him at the mahogany. The invitation
was accepted and while the drinks
were' being served one of the strang
er's guests suddenly clapped his hand
to his Jaw and exclaimed: "There
goes that gosh danged tooth again."
"Toothache?" inquired the new
comer sympathetically, as he placed
a gold piece on the bar.
"Bet it does," replied the sufferer.
"Never had a toothache." remarked
the stranger, "but I don't' think it
would bother me much. Don't seem
to know what pain is."
His auditors looked incredulous. To
prove his assertion the stranger jab
bed himself in the right leg with a
scarf pin.
"Guess you didn't drive it in very
hard," said the bartender. %
"I've got $5 that says you can't hurt
me." boasted the man of no feeling.
"If it wasn't against the rules to
bet while on duty." replied the cock
tail mixer, "I'd take you up and make
you jump skyhlgh."
"Too bad that you are losing such
a chance to make easy money," sar
castically replied the stranger.
"I'll take that bet," replied the mix
ologist with a show of anger.
One of the .party was selected
stakeholder and the saloon man came
from behind, the bar. Taking the
scarf pin from the stranger, who had
extended his right leg to receive the
the water they seemed in no way re
markable. Perhaps all our clothes are
fashioned out or what Mr. Ade calls
steamer rugs, even our 'Tuxedos' and
â¢Prince Alberts," whatever these vest
ments may be. But we, too, have our
peculiarities; we usually wear evening
dress at public dinners, and we do not
march down Piccadilly in â¢ round felt
hats and frock coats. In the course of
this humorous narrative a native tells
a girl who waits at table that 'the
blending under the left ear is poor, and
if you are not careful some one; will
sign you as a spotted What is
'the blending* and why are spotted girls
signed? They may know in Chicago.
Presently a boy enters and says: 'Feed
me everything with one in the light to
ccme along. If any of the cockroaches
ask for me, tell them I'm for all night
with the yellow rattlers; and laid out
at Winona.' Here the reader,~"if a na
tive of Chicago, may hold his sides, but
it was at this point that 'the English
tourist was holding his head.' We need
not pity him; why did he go to Chi
cago/ Que diable allait-il faire dans
cette galere? The next word of un
known connotation Is 'joBher.' The term
hae been applied to myself in a comic
contemporary, and I have wondered
v.hat it meant, i In Mr. Ade's book it is
applied* to an 'advance agent.' Can I
be an 'advance agent'; the Theophile
Gautier is said to have been a Chris
tian without knowing it? The only way
to interpret 'josher' is to compare the
various contexts In which it occurs.
Perhaps it is only a synonym for 'hu
man being.' The final jest is the state
ment of the josher that the girl who
waited at table was his sister. Possibly
she was: quite as possibly there were
no ties of consanguinity between the
young woman and the josher.
" 'The Englishman was deeply per
plexed.' Out of Chicago who is not?
And in Chicago perhaps the learned
are puzzled by 'Wee Macgregor,' a book
apparently couched in the Pictish lan
guage. Among other philological puz
zles we note 'is the graft played out?'
'a rangy person,' 'a cinch,' 'a one-night
stand,' 'a rube 'town,' 'a jay town,'- 'a
four-flush drummer,' 'a rooter from the
days of underhand pitching.' Pitching
is the term for bowling at baseball (if
it is bowling, a matter for the umpire's
decision), but is a 'rooter' equivalent
to a daisy cropper? The following
phrase appears to refer to the terms
of some manly pastime: 'She could get
away with any topic that was batted
up to her, and then slam it over to sec
ond in time to head off the runner.'
There seems to be a combination here
of cricket and Rugby football, but 'the
Englishman is deeply perplexed.' "Don't
renlg' may be excellent advice, but
clamors for a translator. We may re
nig without knowing .that it Is wrong.
'Clarence , stood in with the toughest
push in town; he learned to shoot craps
and. rush the can.' The last phrase may
mean to i>ush about the bottle, but to
say what kind of bird or beast the crap
is, and what kind of education the
crapshooter needs, demands, an educa
tion more extensive and .peculiar, if
not more liberal, than that of the pres
ent Josher. . 'Guff,' I think from the
context, is equivalent to what we call
â¢pulpit oratory.' 'The lookout' certainly
means the pulpit."

about its resources. The fisheries and* fur catch have
long been of great value,- and now it is believed that
Alaska is destined to be the world's greatest gold pro
ducer. The output last year was over $2O,ooo,ooV and
this year it may be nearly double. Under the tundra
lie untold treasures in placer and quartz mines a*nd that
region will be for a long time to come the most attrac
tive to the gold hunter. . v .
' The recent discovery of copper deposits is scarcely
Jess in interest than the gold. From what has been ex
posed in these copper ledges it is believed that the Ter
ritory has more copper than Montana,. Michigan and
Arizona combined. Hand in hand with the progress of
gold and copper finds goes the discovery of coal. Its
quality is better than any of our known bituminous coals.
The latitude is that of Scotland and the quality of the
coal is nearly the same. Cannel coal abounds and the
better class of lignites.
: As the material resources of the become
known, the usual manifestations of human nature appear
among the people. We have had the scramble and scan
dals of Dawson and Nome, 'the judicial juggling with
property, and justice in Alaska has frequently dropped
her blindfold and shamelessly sided with the most liberal
and influential litigant. Where gold is, men lose, too
often, their sense of mine and thine, and have a mutual
disrespect for property rights which, under other cir
cumstances they would regard as sacred. But with it
all, where the American miner goes he founds first a camp
and tnen a city. r The latter may be frail in its buildings
and shabby in its outward aspect, but it gains in the
prosperity of those who make it their headquarters, and
by the time its wooden saloons and dance 'houses are
ready to act as a torch and burn themselves and the rest
of the town, the trails and transportation lines by land
and sea are converged upon the location and refuse to
change, and the town rises from its ashes, a city of brick
and stone and steel. Very soon we will have railroads
to Dawson and to Nome, and away to Bering Straits,
and from a railway terminus to Point Barrow will be a
short trip by water.
President Roosevelt is alive to all this remarkable
development and concludes that the time has come to
put an end to the official scandals of the Territory. These
have been numerous and somewhat picturesque, but in
kind they are just such as are woven into the early,
history and a part of the early romance of all our West
ern mining States. These have survived them and so
will Alaska, and in a few years property will be as safe
there as in New England, and so will the person be,
except for the mosquitoes. The Territory is more^ di
rectly under executive control than our other Territories
were. Its boundary is settled and all the great issues
.that.thp white land generated have been settled, and now
the President has determined to place the foundations
of order there and make it unsafe for any public official
to trifle with his duty. Where the railroad and. tele
graph go law and order must follow,- and an officer's
honesty must not evaporate in proportion to his distance
from Washington. ' /
When the President finishes his shake-up the juggling
with justice will be a thing of the past and the men who
wish to put their enterprise into developing the vast
resources of the country will move rapidly forward as
secure in their rights as they could be anywhere else in
the world. The President's energetic action cannot be
overestimated as affecting the future of Alaska. The
conditions he will extirpate Arould hold the Territory back
indefinitely and -what advance might be made would
be that depending on the strong hand rather than on
the protection of properly administered government.

An interesting affair was the recital
given by the pupils of Miss Agnes
Marie Noonan in elocution and
dramatic art at Steinway Hall last
evening. The opening number, Dun
bar's "Angelina," In Dixie dialect, was
daintily given by ten young ladies in
white, with large yellow chrysanthe
mums and white picture hats.
The harmonic poise movements by
several lltle girls in fluffy white, with
tambourines, showed fine training and
Â¦was the very poetry of motion.
"Wynken, Blynken and Nod," Eugene
Field'8 lullaby, was Illustrated by
twenty little tots in nightgowns, carry
ing candles, and indulging in some
very artistic yawning. This was beau
tifully accompanied in song by S.
Homer Henley.
The grandmothers, given ; by little
tota In the costume of 1832, hoopskirts
and poke bonnets, made the audience
laugh merrily. Quite artistic and
pleasing were the maids of Japan,
with their graceful costumes and
pretty fan motions. The living dolls,
an original conception by Miss
Noonan, vu especially taking. Talent
ed little Ruth Smith, as the Parisian
doll, and her clever brother, Ormonde,
aa the clown, introduced by Lewis
Ford, as the showman, evinced real
talent. ' â
The single numbers, some of which
were dialect and dramatic recitations,
were especially well rendered. The
closing number, "The Star-Spangled
Banner," in pantomime by young la
dles in white Grecian costumes, was
beautiful, the effect being heightened
by the singing of the solo by S. Homer
Henley, ably accompanied by Mrs.
Edward Tlllson on the piano. â¢

were played by Miss Agnes Malony.
The commencement exercises of the
Sacred Heart School were held In
Lyric Hall last evening. The address
of the evening was rendered by his
Grace Archbishop Montgomery, who,
among other very happy remarks,
dwelt particularly on the necessity of
parochial schools "being the foun
tains which supply the, academy, and
college." No parish is fully equipped,
he said, if it lacks schools wherein
every girl and boy' may be accommo
dated. In handing the graduates
their diplomas his Grace the Arch
bishop congratulated them on the ad
vantage of having been bo well trained
by the great educators and self-sacri

raised over the acceptance of Alex

was contended that Dreyfus had paid
taxes for the current year, but as the
assessment roll has not yet been made

The committee directed Superin
tendent Schmitz of the Almshouse and

to make requisitions on the board in

The committee postponed action for
two weeks on the complaint of the
Grand Jury that the fumes from the
Sanitary Reduction Works are dan
gerous to health and that the company
ehould be forced to install a smoke
consumer within twenty-four hours.
A. Sbarboro, president of the com

the installation.

PLAN TO REVOKE LICENSES
FOR THE SALE OF MILK
Notwithstanding reports to the con
trary, the Phelan syndicate, in which
the Magee Brothers are interested,
which recently purchased the Oelrichs
properties in this city for $2,600,000, has
not purchased the Vanderbilt proper
ties. Denial is made that it is nego
tiating for them.
The agents have urged Mrs. Vander
bilt to have the improvements on her
land insured against fire. This ad
vice has been accepted and the insur
ance will represent several hundred
thousand dollars in value. Though the
instructions are for separate c-fferings
of the properties, it is reported that
several investors are in tne field who
wish to take the San Francisco hold
ings of Mrs. Vanderbilt as a whole.
Substantial offers have been made, so
it is reported, by men of large means.
Pending saies. Thcrmas Magee & Sons
â¢will collect all the Vanderbilt rents,
Â¦uill make leases and attend to all the
details of Mrs. Vanderbilfs business.
The firm has never collected any rents
and has confined its operations strictly
to a commission business, buying and
felling properties only, except in this
particular instance, the rents of their
own properties being collected by
i-thers.
Another move of interest has been
made by Mrs. William K. Vanderbilt
Jr. All her real estate and other in
terests In California are to be soKl.
A vast estate will be placed upon the
market as soon as the preliminaries
are perfected. To carry out her wtsh*is
she has instructed Thomas McGee A
Funs to sell all. They, as agents, have
an exclusive written contract on the
entire list of properties. This is con
firmed by Thomas McGee & Sons. The
properties, under special Instructions,
will be trffered separately. The only
delay will be caused by waiting for
detailed information and Dooks of ac
counts from Mrs. VanderDilt.
The Board of Education yesterday
abolished the vertical system of hand
writing now used In the Public School
Department and adopted the system
known as the "Curtiss semi-vertical
freehand writing." The new ' system
was adopted subject to certain condi
tions imposed on the American Book
Company to make any changes in the
script of the various copybooks of the
new system as may be recommended by
Professor P. A. Espina,. teacher of pen
manship in the School Department.'
The company must take up from the
dealers every copy of the existing ver
tical system and give them a copy of
the new system in ' exchange. The
award will terminate upon the adop
tion of a system of penmanship by the
State textbook committee, as the board
concedes the absolute right possessed
by the State school authorities in the
matter. The new system is adopted for
a period of four years from June 3,
1004, and the company must give a bond
at $5000 for the faithful performance of
its agreement The resolution ordering
the change recites that the existing
vertical system is "awkward, unnatural
and inconsltsent."
The board requested the Board of
Public Works to enter into a contract
with Frank McSheehy for additions to
a building in th'e rear* of the Lowell
High School for use as a laboratory on
his bid of $2240.
' The same board was requested to en
ter Into a contract for additions to the
Dudley Stone School with Frank Mc-
Sheehy on his bid of $12,492. The im
provements will be paid out of the cur
rent school appropriation.
The board elected Elmer Rowell a
teacher in the School Department, and
aelgned him to the 'Lowell High School
for duty.
Miss Ellen Bartlett was appointed a
special teacher' in the cookery depart
ment, vice Mrs. Grace Morey, resigned.
Miss Margaret Haussler of the Haight
School was granted a leave of absence
for one month.
The teachers are prepared to act
under the charter provision requiring
the Board of Supervisors to submit
charter amendments upon the petition
of 15 per cent of the electors who
voted at the last general election.
They believe they will experience no
difficulty in securing the required
number of signatures to the petition,
which must number 9000. This course
will be pursued only in the event that
the Board of Supervisors refuses to
pass art ordinance submitting the pro
posed amendment to a vote.
The teachers are Interested in the
proposition because ?lt may result in
a slight Increase "in thÂ«tr salaries.
Again, with sufficient funds the
board could make an allowance so as
to increase the pensions of annuitant
teachers, now reduced to $25 a month.
Then, too, the board would be enabled
to replace wooden school buildings
with modern structures. One of its
first 'acts .under the change would
probably be to erect a Commercial
School building.
Ten hundred and twenty teachers
in the Public School Department are
preparing: to support the Board of
Education In Its announced intention
to petition for the submission to the
voters of a charter amendment provid
ing for the levying of a special munici
pal tax of 10 cents on each $100 of
assessed valuation for the maintenance
of the public schools.
Already the Board of Education
has received assurances, both verbal
and written, from a number of teach
ers'favorlng the proposed change and
pledging assistance In the consumma
tion of the plan.

Umpire Huston is not the best Judge
of balls and strikes In the world. He
showed it plainly the first day he um
pired in this city and his work has not
improved sinca-<hat time. In Thurs
day's game Julie Streib received a
mean rap on the hand from the ball
while at bat, but Huston refused to
allow him to take his base, although
every fan in the grand stand saw the
player get hit. It is an umpire's busi
ness to see these things and Mr. Hus
ton misses a lot of them.
Dunleavy's Injuries are not as seri
ous as was at first thought and the
fast center fielder will soon' be cut
ting "capers in the Oakland outfield.
Lohman thought Dun would not be
able to play any more ball this sea
son, but luckily for him and the team
he' is on the road to a speedy recovery-
It looks as though Jimmy Byrnes
had landed a permanent Job on the
Oakland team. Jimmy was a try-out
man for the last couple of years In
this league as well as in the Pacific
Northwest organization, but for some
reason never held a job long. The ball
he has been playing for Oakland is
good enough to suit anybody. With an
instructor like Pete Lohman*' Jimmy
will improve right along, and, as he
has the best wishes of the local and
the Oakland fans, he will undoubted
ly succeed
Uncle Harris says he will be rest
ing easily as soon aa he grabs another
first baseman. The San Francisco
team certainly needs such a man and
needs him badly. Uncle claims to
have a fast one in the Cast all but
signed up. He will have to get him
on the ground in a. rush If he wants
to cut in on the honors for the first
half of the season.
If Portland could only be spared a
little of that hard luck that has been
landing in hfcr camp by the bucketful
the northern team might give some of
the topnotchers a tussle for the hon
ors. There is no team In the history
of the league that has suffered more
hardships than has the northern aggre
gation. Instead of getting Castro back
into the game Manager Dugdale was
handed a package in the form of the
crippling of Drennan and Francis. But
every road has its turn, and the Web
feet will, surely enjoy a chance to rally
ere long.
That extended series between Seattle
and Tacoma in the north m*y be ex
ceedingly tedious to the fans there, but
at any rate It has done much to make
the race interesting. Both teams are
evenly matched and the way they have
been seesawing makes the run excit
ing./ They will .have still one more
week of it after the present series is
finished, and by that time the Tacoma
fans v/ill never want to see a Seattle
played again, and the Seattle rooters will
about go frantic when they lay eyes on
another Tacoma star. - â¢
The Oakland manager has been doing
great things with his ball team within
the last few weeks, considering it Is
crippled in three places, two of them
almost fatally. Peter himself has not
experienced the pleasure of winging
any base runners out at second for
nearly three weeks, while Francks has
been on the shelf for a week, and Dun
leavy,'s timely bingle has been missed
for more than a month.
Oakland has managed to maintain
the leadership in the baseball, fight for
another fortnight, and the chances of
being the headllner at the first half of
the season, July 24, look good and
bright for the venerable Lohman. At
that, he will not slide in after a leis
urely fashion, for there are a couple
more baseball clubs in the league that
are liable to be after him in hotfoot
order.
When Dugdale Gets Team
in Shape Again There May
Be a Big Surprise in Store
â¢ The mountain streams and lakes are
unusually backward owing to the se
vere winter. The ice is just beginning
to break up at Webber and Independ
ence lakes, and there will be but little
fishing there until about the 20th inst.
The season will open at Bassett's, a
famous resort forty-eight miles north
of Truckee, between July 1 and 10.
William Murdock and Al Langennan
leave to-day for Webber Lake.
E. J. Kaplan, Charles Bishop, W.
Jansen, F. Bonn and H. Jansen fished
the Puris'sima, in San Mateo County,
last Sunday. The creek Is full of flsh,
but they are of small size.
A. M. Cummin*, whose fame a* an
angler is known far and wide, has Just
returned from the Klamath, tanned as
brown as an Indian and with tales. of
the fishing afforded by that noble
stream which send the blood coursing
and surging through the veins of a
sportsman.
In four weeks Mr. Cummlng took 650
pounds, of trout at a point, on .the
stream within' a hundred. yards of the
hotel. . His best catch for one day was
thirty-eight flsh of an average weight
of two pounds. The smallest catch was
ten fish. As the flies were not out he
used the spoon or minnow or crawfish.
The salmon and codis flies are out
now and the trout are striking freely.
The. small tributary to the
riverâ Jenny ' Creek, Bogus, Fall and
Shovel Creeks â will be at their best for
flyfishing next week. They will afford
sport throughout the season.
In* July the quinnat salmon will com
mence to run, and many large flsh are
taken each year. The country is a
sportsman's paradise, as deer, doves,
quail and other game are to be found
in abundance during the season. It is
twenty-four hours from San Francisco,
â¢and of the total distance there is only
nine miles of staging. The Klamath
Lake Railroad connects with the South
ern Pacific.

for the committee's annual stake which
is usually held in July.
The talent figures that Pocatelli,
Barge, Richard Anton and Sacramento
Boy will be the last four in the open
stake to-morrow at Union Park. Sac

The management of Union Park is
preparing to run a sixteen-dog special
stake and a fifty-six-dog reserve stake
each week. It is expected this will
keep the dogs of a class together.
A special meeting of the Interstate
Coursing Club will be held in Pythian
Castle next Wednesday night for the
ninth renewal of the Ladies' ~ Day
Champion Stake. , .
The coursing parks are providing
stakes for the puppies and some prom
ising young coursers are being shown
on the fields. The vicinity of Sacra
mento seems to. be the nursery for
greyhounds, the best coursers for some
years past coming from mat district.
M. C. Delano, J. E. Freeman and J.
Quast have some promising young ones
coming up which are expected to cut
quite a figure in the sport shortly.
F. R. Clark of Honey Grove, Tesas,
has announced his intention of sending
a string of dogs to this coast' as soon
as he can make arrangements for their
training.
The coursing season has opened
auspiciously in Butte. George Mac
dougall's kennel Is doing well. Blake
and Smith also have a strong string of
dogs. Eddie Canavan is doing the
Judging.
Second payment on this year's cours
ing futurity will be due on July L
From the number of nominations it is
expected there will be a sixty-four-dog
stake.
The State championship tournament
is less than a month off. In this event,
which will be played at San Rafael,
the same players will compete, except
that the winner will play Grant Smith
Instead of MacGavin. The latter will
cot take part.
Rlchworth Mekelson, at one time one
of the best players on the coast, is in
town and is playing regularly. He will
probably play at San Rafael. Mekelson
was the academic champion for sev
eral years. â¢"Â¦ Â¦;-.';
The class singles tournament which
Â¦was commenced at the park several
weeks ago will be finished to-morrow.
The tournament completed last Sun
day developed two young players who
will undoubtedly become champions
before many years have passed. These
youngsters are Herbert Long and Her
bert Schmidt. Long is undoubtedly the
most promising player on the coast.
He has been playing less than two
years and still beat men like Mitchell
and Dunlap easily. Long was beaten
by Allen in the semi-finals. He did not
play his best game In this match and
was pitted against a veteran. Allen
plays a tricky game, and his many
years of experience were too much for
Long. The latter practices constantly,
and If he improves in the next year as
he has In the past the champions will
have to look to their laurels.
Schmidt has been playing for years,
but does not practice regularly. Lately
he has been taking the game seriously
and has improved noticeably. In the
last class singles he won the second
class easily. He had one of his good
days on Sunday and beat George Baker,
the champion of the park and ' one of
the cleverest players in the city, easily.
Schmidt, like Long, fell a victim to Al
len's skill. He made a good showing,
but did not play near the game he did
against Baker.
Another promising young player is
Clarence Griffin of the Golden Gate
Club. He was not beaten until he
went against Murdock, the tournament
winner.
The question as to who will be ten-
Bis champion of San Francisco for the
year 1904 will be decided to-morrow
afternoon. At 2:30 o'clock on the Cali
fornia Club courts Percy Murdock, the
tournament winner, will meet J. Drum
xnond MacGavin. the holder of the
title, in the challenge match. These
two players are as evenly matched as
eny two on the coast. They play the
fame style of game, and when they
come together a fast match will i-esult.
Both play a driving, hard-hitting
game, and there is little chance of its
being a long drawn out match. Mur
dock is in slightly better form than
MacGavin, but the latter may have one
of his good days] when he is almost
invincible. This is the first time Mur
dock and MacGavin have come together
in a championship tournament, al
though they have been in tournaments
together many times. MacGavin
smashes and volleys better than his
opponent, but Murdock has a better
back hand stroke and a more puzzling
service. ,

Jack Munroe began to hit hard yes
terday for the first time since he has
been in training and after the husky
miner had broken two punching bags
the big crowd in the gymnasium took
on a wise look and each spectator was
convinced on the spot that the aspirant
for championship honors is possessed
of an ugly punch.
After taking his usual run on the
road and his customary rest. Jack re

terrific swings, the leather bursting In

This feat seemed to please Munroe
and he smiled a . smile of satisfaction
before tackling the big sandbag. He
commenced to hit harder with every

What will the betting be on the
Jeffries-Munroe flght? That is a ques
tion which every sport along the line
is asking. There was a general discus
sion of the topic at Harry Corbett's
last night and most of the knowing
ones predicted the champion would
open a 1 to 2 choice over the miner
and that the odds would gradually
ease down to 10 to 4. There has been
no betting as yet. although when it
opens up a lively time is expected, as
both men have admirers in plenty In

HARBIN SPRINGS, June 3.âCham
pion Jim Jeffries was shot all to pieces
;by two*~ph6togrVphers this afternoon,
and this posing was the only work he
performed during the day, unless a run
down to Middletown and back after
breakfast- is exempted. This surcease
from the arduous duties of training
need cause no alarm, however, for the
big fellow simply played hookey ; in the.
absence of Manager Billy Delarfeyâ
that was all. Even Dick Adams, the
"human football," enjoyed a brief
spell of rest.
Jeff easily holds the reputation of be
ing the best shot in the pugilistic
ranks, for he can knock the gold filling
out of a squirrel's bicusped with a
Maxim quick-firing gun at 500 yards.
At least Adams says he saw him do it
one fall in Southern California.
After an' incident which happened the
other day Dick takes to the tall and
uncut timber whenever the champion
brings out his Winchester. When
nothing else is. on tap Jeff usually
brings out the shooting implements and
will take one chance at almost any
thing in sight. One day last week Ad
ams-while strolling about dropped in
to make Mrs. Jeffries a call. He found
nobody at home and turned to retreat,
only to find Jeff, rifle In hand, at his
heels. Picking up a peculiar looking
pin from a dresser, Dick asked, "Do
you suppose you could hit that, Jeff?"
"Bang!" and the pin fell Jrom Dick's
fingers to the floor. The balance of the
day the hapless pal of the big boiler
maker was as pale as Hamlet's ghost,
and he does not care to figure in any
more William Tell acts.
Once before Jen* Jarred the nervous
susceptibilities of Dick. In the latter's
room are two beds, and on a warm
afternoon Dick was stretched out full
length on one enjoying a novel. Jeff,
rifle under his arm, walked In and
flopped down on the other bed. Dick
was inwardly flattering himself that
the champion was not feeling in a
frisky mood, when there was a flash
and a report. Away went the novel,
and Adams. Is still searching for the
chapter in which the evil designs of the
villain were foiled by the hero.
- To-morrow will see Jeffries at work
again, for Billy Delaney is due to re
turn. F. E. MULHOLLAND.
When the miner finished with the
punching bags he began at his spar
ring partners. Andy Gallagher and
Jack ' Sullivan. Both came in for
some hard wallops during the three
six-minute rounds they went with the
big fellow.- He devoted a lot of time
to hugging and wrestling them- about,
and, though both are big. powerful
men, they seemed like children when
Munroe tussled with them.
After finishing his gymnasium work
Munroe took a dip in the briny, ac
companied by Andy Gallagher. He
swam strongly and seemed to enjoy
the plunge greatly. An admission fee
of 25 cents was charged at the gymna
sium door, but the place filled up be
fore the miner commenced to work
and large numbers had to be turned
away.
the remaining cord. The huge and
ponderous bag swung almost to the
ceiling with every blow, until finally
Jack was cautioned to cut it out or
the ,rope might break and the bag
tumble on the head of one of the
spectators.
Jake Thielman, star of the north and
longed for in the city of the world's
fair, took to the mound yesterday af
ternoon at Recreation Park, but even
his presence in the box could not bring
a. game to the Brownies-, . Â¦ For seven
innings they had the commuters stowed
away. It was only for seven. The
next spasm was a heart-breaker for
the admirers of â¢ Dugdale's clouters.
Three commuters arrived and then it
was off. Score, 4 to' 2.* ;
It was one grand game of ball,' ex
citing and wholesome ; from.. round to
round. Portland .fielded and
hit hard. Oakland did not do so well
in the field, but Mr. Schlafley was a
regular four-miler on the sacks and
was also daring enough to tear- to the
plate on a short hit and thereby tie up
the score.
It was 2 to 1 in favor of the Oregon-'
ians ' when Oakland came up to
take its wallops at the ball in round
eight. Kruger did not infuse any : en
thusiasm into the Oakland 'fans when
he cut three wide swaths In the atmos
phere. It looked a 'little better after
Moskiman. and Schlafley '"got on â¢ the
bags â each by' rapping the ball gently
but firmly cru^ ".to- right field.
Along came Julie Strelb with an easy;
one- to the pitcher, forcing Moskiman
at third. That did not 100k so inviting
either, but Old Red Devereaux sneaked,
softly up to the rubber and landed
that ball out to left field on a llneJ. j
Schlafley tore avay from second and
came right to the plate. A good throw
would have nailed him for fair, but;
the throw was not good and, therefore.
the score was tied.. â¢
Streib- ambled around- to third on
this bingle and Brick stole second on
the first ball pitched to Francks. The
next one came sailing up loyely and
big;- ..Buck' liked it and shot it 'out past
Beplc 'Strelb and Devereaux trotted
in and then-it was really aH'over.
; Cooper pitched a grand game of ball,
though getting. hlt^Kard"^n*Bppts.
Tay Strelb started to play ehort, but
hurt Jiis. "j,.-)kle while fielding the first
bali hit.'. He retired and Buck Francks
went out to work. He saved the game.
In .the severith.r' after y Thielman had
doubled; to. the flagpole" and .arrived on
third ohDrennan's out, llcCreedle hit

was one of those balls that go for hits

STANDING OF THE CLUBS.
The only breach of golf etiquette oc
curred during the afternoon, when a
few spectators applauded Travis' fail
ure in putting at the third hole. This
offense was Instantly hissed _y the ma
jority of those present. â s a rule the
American's brilliant game elicited
bur"ta of applause at almost every
hole. The large Scotch contingent was
the most ready to con. ie Travis' su
periority, even before the afternoon
round was started. Blackwell, after
the match, said to a representative of
the Associated Press: "Trav.. is a
great golfer. He deserved to win. I
was a trifle off my game di :ng the
morning and lost r veral holes I ought
to have won. The strain told oi me."
Travis must defend the championship
on this side next year. The Prestwick.
Ayr- "lire, course has been selected for
the contest.
The American found the wind dif
ficult and lost the tenth. The next two
were halved, and Blackwell ought to
have reduced his deficit to one at the
thirteenth. His putting, however, was
bad and he lost the hole. Thereafter
he never looked like drawing level, and
Travis finished the first round with
four up. His score by strokes was
eighty, Blackwell taking eighty-three.
Travis, throughout, gave the samÂ«
remarkable display of putting which
has gained him here the reputation
of being the finest exponent in the
world of the short game. He was never
in the slightest danger throughout the
tournament. The gallery numbered
about 500. Although their sympathies
were almost unanimously with Black
well, they could not refrain from ap
plause at Travis' brilliant game, and
the American's superiority over the
Scotchman was admitted, coupled with
expressions of regret that an older and
a more representative golfer was not
pitted against the American in the
final. About a score of Americans fol
lowed the game. The Britons extracted
some comfort from the fact that Travis
was born In Australia. The best feeling
was manifested on both sides, and the
winner wts heartily cheered.
BREACH OP ETIQUETTE.
L.OXDOX, June, 3.â Walter J. Travts
and E. D. Black^vell started to play the
final tie ot thirty-six "holes for the
amateur golf championship at Sand
wich to-day in a high wind, which
greatly affected the driving. Travis won
the first in five to six and, running
down one of his -long putts on the sec
ond green, became two up. Blackwell
missed a hard putt (or the third, which
was halved, and he lost the fourth,
where Travis holed out a long putt.
.The American also won the fifth by
getting down a fifteen-yard putt and
then missed a short putt for the sixth.
where he sustained his first loss. The
seventh was halved and Travis won tha
eighth, where Blackwell missed a five
foot putt. The Scotchman took the
ninth hole, where Travis drove into a
bunker. The American was three up
at the turn, his outward score approxi
mately being thirty-five strokes.

have ridden Cormack, who had .the
mount on Lord of the Valley, into the
rail and so injured the boy's left foot
that he was forced to give up the
mount on Ike S. which won the sec

TACOMA, June 3.â M. 1* V. Smith,
the mail carrier between Nome and
Council City, had an experience that
he will not soon forget. He left Nome
with a large mail and struck out over
the ice on Norton Sound. Soon after
he started the ice moved out from the
shore and that night and the following
day he was cut off from all communica
tion with the land. He had nothing to
cat and expected to die of exposure and
starvation when he was seen by natives
who launched a boat and went to his
rescue. He hurried forward and de
livered the mail on time.

NEW YORK, June 3.â R. G. Dun &
Co.'b Weekly Review of Trade to-mor
row will say:
Interruptions of industrial progress
by the holiday; labor, conflicts and in
clement ~ weather again produced a
somewhat unsatisfactory trade situa
tion. Yet money . Is easy and accom
modation Is readily - obtained in le
gitimate business channels. Liabili
ties ol mercantile failures are com
paratively small, indicating that most
concerns have prepared for a qulet^ea
f on and are able to withstand a period
of diminished sales and tardy pay
ments. ; This conservative attitude
is the fundamentally strong feature of
the situation, and when business re
vives there will be no pressure to dis
pose of heavy stocks of undesirable
goods. More rhanufacturing plants
have reduced hours or wages, and
several strikes have added to the
army of unemployed.
No definite change Is reported In the
iron and steel industry, quotations be
ing barely maintained, and new con
tracts placed with great discrimina
tion. .
Business failures in the United States
for the week ending June 2 number 194.
against 1S4 last week, 177 in the like
week In 1903. In Canada failures num
ber 20 for the week, against 14 last
week and 13 in this week a year ago.
NEW YORK, June 3. â Bradstreet's
to-morrow will say:
Pending clearer view of future crop
outturn, general trade in industry is
quiet to the verge of dullness. Crop
prospects have improved in some sec
tions, but complaints come from others,
so that this situation is as a whole still
irregular. The volume of May business
both at wholesale and retail was dis
appointing, confirmation of this being
found in the decreases in the bank
clearings and in railway earnings from
a year ago, while failures were more
numerous, though less costly than in
recently preceding months, while show
ing fncreases on a year ago. Iron and
steel, bituminous coal and cotton man
ufacturing are notably quiet for this
season of the year. There are, how
ever, some signs underlying confidence
in future trade. These consist of re
ports of improved Inquiry for fall goods
at. some Western, Southern and East
ern points, a rather better tone In the
shoe and leather industry at the East,
active buying at full prices of the new
Western wool clip, and fairly good re
ports from the woolen Industry, nota
bly that part dealing with c/othliig
trade. Collections partake of trade ir
regularity, but are still classable as fair.
Prices of staples show a general sag
ging tendency, part of w~hich is sea
sonable. Briefly summed up, the sit
uation generally centers upon the
probable outturn of the growing crops
and until this matter is settled most
authorities look for comparative quiet
in most lines.
Hackmen attended the meeting In
force and at the conclusion were, in a
jovial mood. ., 'When John Rayborn,
whom all the men admit they hate,
came downstairs and started for a
buggy a number of the hackmen gath
ered around him and felt of his cloth
ing. Rayborn protested, whereupon
one of the hackmen said that Rayborn
had a pistol. To avoid any further
trouble Rayborn was taken into the
police station and searched. No weapon
was found upon him and he was re
leased. As Rayborn started to drive
away from the corner cries of "Scab"
were hurled at him. Fully ' 150 men
were congregated at the point of Ray
born's departure. The .owners will
have a meeting Monday night.
Joseph H. Myers/ 458 Hayes street,
will be before the Commissioners at the
next meeting and in the meantime ho
will study up the location of streets.
R. A. Waldenburg was denied Â¦ and
Paul W. Burgess has gone to Oakland,
.where^he will drive a milk wagon and
not bother about the hacks of San
Francisco. â¢
B. I... Dlckbver and PauUQ.'Schmit,
who both informed their landlady at
640 Howard street that they were se
cret service men, . were told . to : come
back again after they knew more about
the city's topography.
Charles C. Hatfleld of 716 Larkin,
August Koops, 636 Howard; William
J. Barrett, S69 Market; Embry Sutton,
405 Turk, and H. T. Ralph were denied
permits in the order named. -
William Rahill had in an independent
application for a permit and said he
wanted two more men to drive the
hacks that he owned. He was told to
get his men and have them make ap
plication.
George F. Jones was present. George
had such an accumulation of booze in
his system that Commissioner Hutton
told him that he better go and get
sober and come back on Tuesday night,
at which-time his application , for the
honorable position to which he aspired
would be considered. George went.
MUST STUDY STREETS.
Roy Halser was not present. He was
denied a permit. William Pussley, who
said he lived at the Winchester House
and was.an old cab. driver, was given
time to study the location of streets
and familiarize himself with thu.city
ordinances relating to cab hire.
WILL HAVE NEW CHANCE. .
Charles E. Â¦ Harding of 792 Grove
street was granted a permit after he
had assured the Commissioners that
he had. sufficient knowledge of the city
and the duties involved in the driving
of a hack.
B. 12 Lowman and Frank F. Francis
were denied as rapidly as their names
were called. F. M..Christmon was re
ported as having -been convicted of a
felony. The Commissioners were will
ing to give thie. man a chance, but he
did not put in an appearance. His ap
plication was denied.
Frederick- R. Sldler said he lived at
315 Eddy street, but. an investigation
demonstrated differently. He is a re
cent arrival from New York. His
knowledge of the city streets was de
ficient and his application failed. Â¦
Charles Watson was reported ill,
hence he did not get a permit. John J.
Romard withdrew his request for a
permit.
CA3DE FROM >TSW YORK.
" The Citizens' Alliance was represent
ed by Secretary White of the Stable
and Carriage Owners' Association, the
Hackmen's Union by President Coffey.
White contended that the Commission
ers had taken an unfair course in the
questions propounded. Coffey sized the
result aa aVlctory for the Hackmen's
Union. The Commissioners deny both
supposltiqns.
Merritt S. Smith was called. He was
not present, hence his application was
denied. John Rayborn of 761% Howard
street was the next. Although the un
ion says Rayborn has been a "strike
breaker" for years, he could not an
swer the questions. His application was
denied.
.Only two men out ' of twenty-flve
were found to be competent to drive
public hacks or carriages on the streets
of San Francisco after the Police Com
missioners got through with the ap
plicants yesterday - afternoon. (Geo
graphical locations of buildings, the
proper route to take from the ferry to
any destination ", and the ' charges to
make were the queries propounded.

LONG BEACH,. June 3.â John J.
Overton, who claimed to be 107 years
of aee, died here to-day after a week's
illness. He did not suffer at all; but
gradually became weaker until he
breathed his last For ; many years
Overton had been pointed out*- to vis
itors as the oldest living Odd Fellow.
The members of his family have no
record 'of his birth and some' of them
privately have denied the truth of
Overton's statement . that he was so
old. One of his favorite diversions was
that of talking 1 about events \ which
happened" in the early twenties, and
his only pastime for years j had been
that of gathering strangers" about him
and relating events which have become
historic. He was a veteran of the Mex
ican and Civil wars and in the thirties
participated in some of the Indian
campaigns of the I Middle "West. He
was "a native of. Â»ew York and had
lived in California thirty years. He
leaves twenty-three grandchildren and
more than Ufirty great-grandchildren.

Receipts of Strawberries continue to de

a result of the hot weather Here and ta the
growing district*. Prices of Ldngworths had
a wide range yesterday, witn sonie pow lets
selling below the minimum quotations and
occasional lots of extra fancy commanding a
premium. The canners securâ i some Malindas
at the tastde rate, but the bulk of tne recsipU
sold at *2 5CÂ©1 iA per chest. Nearly all of
rhe offerings of Blackberries were of orttnary
quality and scid slowly. Two chests of strictly
fancy stock came hi from Cerrelttii* aad met
with prompt sale at SCc per drawer, or $10 per

weak. Currants continued vÂ«ry dull and sold

Fi?s were acarce aad firmer. No mere
Watermeloas came la from Coachella. but
Cantaloupes arrived ratber freely from thai

Caerrtss were the most active as well as the
most r-leatiful fruit oa the market, but re
ceipts were far too heavy for the market ta
absorb, aad despite the active trading prices
were lower and there were large lines of loose
and packed stock still unsold at the close. The
canners were liberal buyers and paid 24^:*-. â¢

acd 5^3 4c for Hoyai Anne. All dealers re
ported a firm and active market for sound

CHICAGO, June 3. â Alarm In regard to
damage by floods caused a sharp upturn in
wheat to-<iay. the July delivery dosing at an
advance cf l%$2c. Numerous reports of dam
age in Kansas and Missouri, the result of
heavy rains ta that section, had a bullish
effect at the start and initial sales on July
were up i*t?%c to 4'SÂ»ie at 8743S-S7*Â«c.
A rumor that a large business In flour had
been dene yesterday at Minneapolis on orders
from Japan helped to keep alive bullish senti
ment during the first hour. The market soon
became easier, however. A denial of reported
fisur sales at Minneapolis helped to bring about
the reaction. On the decline July sold off ta
S7m?S7**c. Late la the day sentiment again
became exceedingly bullish. The cause of
tbÂ« renewed strength was the report of a
Minneapolis expert claiming the likelihood of
great damage by fieods la the Southwest. Ac
cording to this authority Indications are for
half a crop In Texas, a small crop in Okla
homa aad a sensational decline In yield
throughout . the Ohio Valley. The demand was
extremely active the last half-hour and prices
aJvanced rapidly. The close was practically
at the high point. After touching Â».Â«Sc July
closed at S3 4c
Heavy rains In the West and strength la
wheat ware the Influences that created a
strong tone In corn. The market closed at
the high point. July opened Vtf?4# hljcher
at EC^tJW^c and closed at the top at 51 He
Rain had a strengthening effect upon the
oats market similar to that In wheat and
com. After opening unchanged to $&C higher
at 3a^i9X>'ie, July closed at 40%Â®404c.
Provisions were firm throughout the entire
session. Trading was dull early m the day.
but the tats outburst !a wheat caused an
advance. The market closed almost at the
top. Decreased receipts of hogs had a bullish
effect at the start. Trading was mainly in
the September options. September pork clewed
with a gain of 274c at Sll S74. September
lart was up 74C10c and ribs were up

New York Stock Market.*
NEW YORK. June 3.â During the first
I hour of to-da.y'a market a few large buying
criers were executed in a number of stocks,
lifting them to a higher level and causing the
gen-sral market to harden In sympathy. The
movement was net pursued and the market
fell into intense dullness, with no evidence
j cf a c",sj>esition either to buy or sell. The
usijertoue was kept firm by tniÂ« absence of
j Â»elliE* pressure, but thÂ« market was as near
I stagnant as at any time slace the present neg
1 >ct set in. The recovery in prices was not
accounted for by anything in the day's news.
Excessive rains tn the grain regions wer*
counted against the prospects cf the crops, and
â¢cme ratier sensational reports circulated tn
Wail itreet cf damage by floodsi The nervous
â¢- Â¦ -Â» in the cotton market gave rise u> some
rather disturbing rumors of money troubles
growing out of the conditions la ttat mar
ket, but tie effect was ignored on the Stock
Exchange. An unofficial estimate on the acre
age cf the present crop and the June I condi
tion received more attention in tne etock mar
ket than did the movements in the cotton
market itself. The estimates of the week's
currency movement indicate a continuance of
the Sow to tils center. New York gain seems
to be lees Than last week, and New York ex
change at Chicago is rwing slightly. With
the gam on Â«ubtreasury operations there la
promise of an Increase in cash . of over
, $7,000,000 to be shown by to-morrow'Â« bank
statement. The statement cf the June 1 money
I in tne csustry was of interest as showing a
decrease of but S23.3tS.21S f<>r May. tn spite
of the heavy outgo of gold. The month's de
crease ts more than accounted for by the de
cUne in gold. But. compared with a year ago,
the amount cf meney tn circulation fcae la
creased S127.1C5.092. cf which S90.2S1.97S was
tn gold coin and certificates. The Indifference
to tie present cutiow of gold, unprecedented
as ft Is tsvetved. for tne period covered is thus
urOrsjood.
Pemusaion was given to-day for the tele- i
graphic transfer to New York ct Si.730,000 la I
Japanese yen to arrive in S*n Francisco next !
week. The report of &tt earnings for April of I
the Union Pacific and the Scuthern Pacific
were decidedly more favorable than has been
the rcie for that month. The stocks of these
roads were even more dull and indifferent than
tne average of the list. A fall tn the price of
copper was without effect la stocks. Frac
tional advances in the coalers and in United
States Steel preferred made the closing firm.
I with crices well maintained.

The deed in question was made in
August, 1895, and conveyed to Kellogg
the entire holdings of Levison and his
wife. The property deeded, which con
sisted of realty on Sutter street, near
Kearny> realty in Nevada, New Jersey
and Germany, and the interest of Levi
son in the California Jewelry Company,
Is estimated to be worth several hun
dred thousand dollars. The deed pro
vided that Kellogg during the lifetime
of Levison and his wife should pay
them $40,000 a year, Mrs. Levison to re
ceive $10,000 and Levison $30,000. It also
provided that the trustee should pay
$50,000 each to Louis O. Levison and
Robert J. â¢ Levison, sons of the de
ceased, when they became 25 years of
age, and that upon the death of both
of the elder Levlsons the trust should
cease and the estate be distributed in
equal shares to the two sons and Em
ma Levison Jonas, a daughter.
Levison died a year after making the
deed. His death did not affect the trust
deed, for the widow and her children
were satisfied with it and continued
sharing Levison's estate, as thÂ§ deed
provided they should. It was when
Gustav Marcus, as executor of Levi
son's will, in order to test the validity
of the document, claimed that the
property should be turned over to him
as executor that It was determined
that an opinion of the court should
be sought. A suit to quiet title was
commenced, with the result that the
deed has been sustained, , and Marcus
as executor has been declared to have
no interest in the property conveyed to
Kellogg as trustee.
Judge Troutt decided yesterday that
the trust deed made by the late Her
man Levison and his wife. Henrietta,
a year before his death in 1896, convey
ing all his property, both real and per
sonal, to M. B. Kellogg, to be held by
him for the benefit of the Levison fam
ily during the lifetime of the makers
of the deed, is a valid deed, and that
the property conveyed therein Is not
subject to the supervision of Gustav
Marcus as executor of Levison's will.
The* findings were signed yesterday.
Judge Troutt Declares That
Trust Created by Herman

When the case was called yesterday
Attorney Salomon made the formal
motion on statutory grounds and
chiefly on the ground of newly discov
ered evidence. He filed an affidavit
asking for a continuance and alleging
that he had information which he be
lieved to be true that John Cooper, to
whom Soeder confessed that he killed
Blaise, had been convicted of a felony
â¢In the State of Washington, although
Â¦he denied that fact under oath.
The Judge said he had no wish to
rush matters and thought a contin
uance should be granted, although he
<31d not think that evidence of that
character could be classed as Inewly
discovered evidence. Salomon prom
ised to be ready by June 21.
The sentence of death upon Leon
Boeder, convicted of the murder of
Joseph Blaise, his brother-in-law, on
the night of January 10, has been
postponed at the request of his attor
neys till June 21. so that they can

Judge /Mogan dismissed the case of
battery against ' Emll Tschnoni, the
Olympic Club athlete whose automo
bile struck Nicholas Holdback while
that gentleman was watching a wizard
perform at Kearny and California
streets one evening last week. Mr.
Temple declared, that he had a witness
who would swear that the . auto was
carelessly handled, but, alas! the wit
ness would not appear In court unless
he were paid one dollar in advance for
his attendance. Then the Judge said
he would not believe anything sworn

Mr. Temple waxed very wroth.

In the same court Thomas McGee,
a horseshoer, was acquitted on the
charge of assaulting Charles Fahren
krog, a "picket" for the Stablemen's
Union, who was patrolling in front of
the Stanford stables on Ellis street
when the alleged battery took .place.
McGee ; was not connected with the
boycotted establishment, but was ad
vising one "Stump" McDonald, also a
"picket," to be on his guard against
some of the non-union Inmates when
Fahrenkrog "butted In" and addressed
some offensive remarks to McGee. Two
stitches were required to make Fah
renkrog's nose presentable after Mc-
Gee had smitten, it. The testimony
was radically contradictory, as the tes
timony in such v cases Invariably is, and
the Judge's dismissal of the' case was
apparently Influenced by trie provoca
tion received by the defendant.
Leiteia Lau, wife of Dr. Lau, a
Chinese dentist, was the complaining
witness in Judge Cabaniss' court
against Maurice Charles, a restaura

had been insulted by the defendant

firing bullets from an airgun through
a rear window, of her residence, 1106%
Stockton street, adjoining the defend
ant's place of business. Mrs. Lau was

a writ of certiorari applied for by the
defendant's attorneys. If the writ Is
knocked out by Judge Sloss the exam
ination will take place before Judge
Fritz next Friday.
The application states that the com
plaint against Gunther charges more
than one offense, that a -warrant can
be issued for only one offense and that
Gunther is not advised in the warrant
as to the particular offense for which
he was arrested. It is also contended
that the section of the Civil Code un

Mr. Douglas and Mr. Andrews were
arm-in-arm as they departed from the
tribunal. Mrs. Douglas walked behind
Mrs. Andrews. The ladies did not shake
hands. ; ;

Honor, "if it hadn't been for the sex,

him your hand. And you, Mr. Douglas,
would not, I'm sure, refuse to accept
such a pledge of renewed friendship."
Both hands went out simultaneously
and interlocked in cordial grasp.
"Case dismissed," said the Judge.
James Douglas, laundry man, and Ed
ward Andrews, machinist, assured Po
lice Judge Cabaniss that the quarrel
was not of their making, and each of
them regretted having permitted him
self to be dragged into It by his wife.
Never again, they added, shall a wom

fell to the floor and was smashed. Mrs.
Andrews told her husband of what had
