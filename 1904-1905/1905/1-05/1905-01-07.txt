Evidence That Southerners Will Not
Dnite on Bard Seems to Be
Accumulating.
â¢. Henry T. Oxnard, Frank P. Flint and
. George A. Knight, candidates for Unit
.'cd States Senator, came from Sacra
mento yesterday and were at the palm
court of the Palace Hotel last evening,
exchanging views on the Senatorial sit
uation. They will return to the capital
to-morrow evening and actively renew
" the battle for the honor of represent
â¢ ing California in the United States
Senate.
Common rumor or expectation that
" the candidates came here to confer
with W. F. Herrin of the Southern Pa
.'ciflc law department is not admitted,
: but on the contrary is promptly denied
by. each and all.
George -A. Knight, when asked if he
â¢ had seen Herrin, replied promptly: "I
arrived here this morning and have not
â¢ "teen Mr. Herrin, except to say 'Good
â¢ day' on the street, and do not expect to
' see him or confer with him. I have no
reason to doubt his assurances that he
'will keep 'hands off' my fight for the
â¢ Senatorship, and I am confident that I
â¢ will win."
. Replying to a question similar to
- that addressed to Knight, Frank P.
Flint replied: "I have not seen or con
,' ferred with Mr. Herrin, and have 40
'intention of seeking an interview. All
â¢that I expect of him is that he will
; keep 'hands off' the Senatorial con
test. I am confident that I will be
elected Senator if the influence of the
railroad is not cast in favor of some
other candidate. I shall return to Sac
.ramento to-morrow night and renew
.my efforts to achieve success. I shall
appeal for support on my merits and
record. I will make a straightforward,
â¢ open contest for the favor of the Legis
lature. If Mr. Knight wins or Mr.
-Fisk wins or Mr. Bard wins I will of
fer the winner my congratulations on
his success. I do not intend that this
contest shall mar the long friendship
â which has existed between Mr. Knight
and myself."
OXNARD A FREE LANCE.
â¢ -Henry T. Oxnard is not suspected of
taking orders from any department of
".the Southern Pacific. In a sense Ox
, "nard is a free lance and may make the
Senatorial contest decidedly breezy be
,.. fore it draws to a finish. He says that
..the tremendous majority which Cali
fornia gave to President Roosevelt
must' be accepted as a great popular
"â¢.demonstration in favor of the Presi-.
'dent's vigorous policy to curb the
..grasping trusts and railroad corpora
.-. tio'ns of the country. Oxnard distinctly
vavows that he will stand by the Presi
dent in the fight of the administration
; .'against the exactions of the transporta
tion- companies.
â¢â¢ The question is asked:
"Has any other candidate the nerve
â J.tD announce to a Legislature that is
.. looking for a railroad sign that he will
.stand by the people and the President
â¢in a war to regulate the transportation
.companies?"
â¢ ' Oxnard is sure that the Southern Cal-
Ifornians cannot unite on either Bard
. or Flint, and he would not be surprised
"M himself and Arthur Fisk would go
: to the front at the finish. Oxnard hopes
.that' Fisk will prove to be a good loser.
~':- The' assertion is freely made in the
...Qxnard camp that Flint, at the begin
ning of the Senatorial campaign was
â¢an out. and out supporter and adviser
.'. pf Oxnard.
,-. Thomas Hughes of Los Angeles and
â¢ Frank J. Brandon of San Jose, repre
sentatives of the Bard column, came in
" from Sacramento last evening and will
to the capital city to-morrow.
â¢ They are somewhat vexed by what they
.-consider authentic reports that Speaker
â¢Prescott, in handing out committee
r .chairmanships, is seeking to advance
the fortunes of Flint. The story is told
. : that Assemblyman Moore of San Joa
â¢ quin was bluntly advised by the Speak
. er to get on the Flint end.
FIGHTING RAILROAD.
It- is doubtful if the Southern Cali
... fornia forces can ever be brought to
. gether in solid support of either Bard
' <>r Flint. Men of the south who wear
â¢the railroad collar are instructed or ad- 1
to fight Bard to the finish. The
.independent Republicans of Los An
".â¢geles, such as General Otis, Thomas j
Hughes and R. N. Bulla, would rather
see a northern candidate succeed than
witness the success of a railroad can
didate, it was remarked by Hughes
last evening:
"The anti-machine Republicans of
the south who have fought so earnestly
to protect the party from the dominat
ing power of the railroad machine
would be forced to give Mp the fight if
Flint were chosen Senator."
Leaders of the Bard columii are

Wife of Banker Gelstienen
Unexpectedly Sails ior
4 Europe.
Lawyers Suspected of Having Ad

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Jan. 6.âWhile District
Attorney Jerome has been searching
for Mrs. William H. Gelshenen! a
banker's wife, whom he wants as wit
ness in the Dodge-Morse case before
the Grand Jury, she has been on the
hiKh seas, having sailed last Tuesday
on the Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse.
In notifying Jerome of the fact,
through a public statement, James M
Beck, Mrs. Gelshenen's attorney and
former Assistant United States Attor
ney General, severely criticized the
District Attorney for maktyig public on
Thursday night a letter he had writter
to Mrs. Gelshenen. Beck declared thai
"if such a method is to be followed thÂ«
reputation of no woman in New York
however reputable her character ma>
be, is safe."
"The legal fraternity of New Yorli
ought to make up their minds that this
office is a live wire," retorted Jerome.
"The voltage is very high and if any
body tries to take it in his hand he is
very likely to be short-cJccuiteTd."
Although Jerome* wodld not
there le a strongprobability that Becfi
will be called to appear before the
Grand Jury on Monday and will be
asked tq explain why, according to the
information of the District Attorney,
Mrs. Gelshenen changed her mind and
sailed for Europe last Tuesday instead
of to-day as originally planned.
Samuel Untermeyer, who has repre
sented Charles W. Morse, is also likely
to be called on the same mission. As
sistant District Attorney Rand made a
statement yesterday that Beck was
Untermeyer's guest at Yonkers on
Sunday; that Beck had the letter ad
dressed to Mrs. Gelshenen on Monday
and that her plans were at once
changed so that she left the country
the next day.
Mrs. Gelshenen was one of the wit
nesses upon whom District Attorney
Jerome relied to indict prominent so
ciety people for alleged perjury and
conspiracy to obtain a divorce.

Failure of the south to agree on Flint,
Bard or Oxnard may cause the name of
U. S. Grant, ex-Congressman R. J.
Waters and Congressman-elect S. C.
Smith to be considered at the peace
conference to be held in Sacramento
next. Monday or Tuesday. It Is said in
the general gossip of the situation that
the Bard votes of the north cannot be
transferred to Flint or Oxnard. Belief
Is expressed that they would scatter,
some going to Knight and others to
Fisk, in the event of failure to re-elect
Senator Bard. It is clearly the purpose
of the railroad to hammer
Bard and if possible drive him from
the field, although Flint, Knight and
Oxnard all agree that Bard is a man
of high character, independent, self
reliant and in every sense a stalwart
Republican and a creditable representa
tive of California United States
Senate. George A. Knight inquires:
"What kind of a man does the south
want if Bard is not acceptable??"
Another question is asked: "Are the
110 Republican members of the Legis
lature going to turn down Bard simply
because he is not acceptable to the rail
road?"

SAN FRANCISCO, SATURDAY, JANUARY 7, 1905.
BEEF TRUST
HAS INNING
IN COURT
Argument Presented
Before Supreme
Tribunal,
Held Suit Is Unprecedented
Interference Willi
Business.
Judge Holmes Interrupts Case to State
He Is Interested in Other Stock
yards Not Involved.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.âArgument
In the case of Swift & Co. vs. the United
States, known as the beef trust con
spiracy case, was begun before the Su
preme Court of the United States to
day by Attorney John S. Miller of Chi
cago in behalf of the packers. He at
tacked the bill of the Government as
insufficient in its failure to allege facts
necessary to constitute a cause of ac
tion, and said that the charges made
were not facts, but conclusions of law;
that the commerce charged was not in
terstate nor foreign commerce, and that
even if it were interstate commerce the
facts given constituted no violation of
law.
He said that an injunction had been
prayed for and secured from the United
States Circuit Court for the Northern
District of Illinois under the Sherman
anti-trust act. He contended that the
case presented an interference in busi
ness such as never before had been un
dertaken. The charges, he said, were
of the most general character and did
not specify time and place.
did not believe, therefore, that the
charges could stand at ali, and h<?
quoted the indictments in the whisky
case to show that charges much more
specific than were here made had been
regarded as insufficient.
FEARS COURT CONTROL.
"It is alleged," interrupted Justice
White, "that your clients' agents com
bined to refrain from bidding in order
to put prices down, and again agreed
to put them up. Do you think there
should have been a specification of hour
and place?"
"Yes, your Honor/V responded Miller.
"If the Government had the facts why
should it not have given them?"
"Did you ask for a bill <Sf particu
lars?" inquired Justice Harlan, and
Miller replied in the negative, saying
that the defendants had filed a de
murrer in the case.
Miller said that if the packing indus
try could be interfered with as pro
posed in this case, the manufacturing
industries could- be similarly regulated,
and "thus you will find," he added,
"the Federal courts regulating a con
siderable part of the commerce of the
country-"
He contended that there was no in
terstate commerce involved, because
the business of the packers, including
the purchase of cattle and the sale of
meat, was confined entirely to Chicago.
Explaining the economic condition,
Miller said the demand for fresh meat
wag fairly uniform, and owing to the
necessity for maintaining a proper sup
ply of an acceptable article, he said,
there should be some understanding
among the packers. This was, he said,
perfectly legitimate, and the Govern
ment itself might properly assume the
supervision. The cattle supply was
not so regular as the demand, and to
this fact Miller attributed the fluctua
tion in prices.
HOLMES HOLDS STOCK.
At the beginning of Miller's present
ation of the case he was interrupted
by Justice Holmes, who said he held
stock In the Union Stockyards in Chi
cago and also in the Kansas City yards,
and inquired if they were involved in
the case. Miller replied that they were
not.
When Miller concluded Attorney Gen
eral Moody began. It was idle, he
said, to discuss the contention that the
charges of the bill are not connected
one with another. Be that as it may,
he added, the purpose of the suit was
single, and all the separate parts of
the bill were Interdependent for the
accomplishment of that end.
He also maintained the constitution
ality of the bill, and asked for the
books of the packers. Moody had
scarcely begun when the court ad
journed until Monday.

Exciting Scenes At

Session,
House Speaker and Lieu

Claim the Chair.
Pandemonium Reigns When Ruling
of One Presiding Officer Is Set
Aside hy the Other.
DENVER, Jan. 6.âBehind locked
doors and amid scenes of great confu
sion and excitement the Colorado Leg
islature to-day passed a resolution cre
ating a committee of fifteen members
to canvass the vote castf for Governor
at the last election and submit a report
to the Legislature not later than 2
o'clock on the afternoon of next Mon
day. The committee is composed of
five Senators and ten Representatives,
the political division being twelve
Republicans and three Democrats. It
organized this afternoon by the election
of Senator Arthur Cornforth of Colo
rado Springs as chairman and will com
mence the hearing of evidence to-mor
row.
The trouble began with the first ses
sion of the joint session and continued
until its close. It was expected that
there would be a contest over the re
spective rights of Speaker Dickson and
Lieutenant Governor Haggott to pre
side over the joint session. The Speaker
based his opinion that it was his right
to preside on a section of the State con
stitution which says the#flpeaker shall
open and publish the%afteetlon returns
in the presence of a majority <tt both
branches of the Legislature. Lieuten
ant Governor Haggott construed his
right to direct the proceedings on a
statute which declares that in conduct
ing any contested election the General
Assembly shall convene in Joint session
and that the President of the Senate
shall preside unless he Is the contestee.
Legal advice was given to each gen
tleman that his position was correct
PANDEMONIUM REIGNS.
Lieutenant Governor Haggott was
assured that the wording of the statute
amply covered the case. Speaker Dick
son was advised by his attorneys that
the proceeding was not officially known
to be a contest, and that a provision
of the State Constitution always over
rides a statute when the two are in
conflict. When Lieutenant Governor
Haggott mounted the rostrum Speaker
Dickson was standing in front of the
center of his desk, and did not move.
The Lieutenant Governor advanced,
the two men smiled, bowed, shook
hands and then stood gazing into each
other's eyes. Neither man made a
move and their features hardened as
they realized the situation. Together
they turned to face the Assembly, the
Speaker behind the center of the desk,
the Lieutenant Governor at his left
hand. Gently edging up to the Speak
er, Lieutenant Governor Haggott gave
him a gentle "hunch" with his shoul
der, as If to shove him along. The
Speaker was immovable. The gentle
"hunch" was repeated and still the
Speaker held his ground and brought
down his gavel with a thump.
"The clerk of the House will call the
roll," he said.
Bang! went the gavel of the Lieuten
ant Governor. He is a powerful man
physically, and every time he brought
hig black gavel down the pitcher of
water on the Speaker's desk trembled
and the tumblers bumped and jingled.
"The clerk of the Senate will call the
roll," he shouted.
SCENES OF CONFUSION.
Clerk Harper of the House and Sec
retary Farwell of the Senate began to
call their respective rolls, while great
confusion arose in the House. Mem
bers laughed, cheered and shouted,
while Representative Street a Demo
crat, gave vent to the cowboy yell,
"Yip, yip, yip!" A few names had
been called when Representative Fre
wen, a "Wolcott Republican," shout
ed: "Mr. Chairman!"
"Mr. Frewen, responded the Lieu
tenant Governor, "you are out of or
der."
"Mr. Frewen," shouted the Speaker,
"you have the floor."
"Mr. Frewen," said the Lieutenant
Governor.
Bang! bang! went the Speaker's
gavel; boom! boom! went the gavel
of the Lieutenant Governor.
Frewen accepted the ruling of the
man who gave him what he wanted
and commenced to speak to a point
of order which was that the President
of the Senate was the proper presid
ing officer at a joint session.
"You are out of order, sit down,"
commanded the Sneaker.
"You have the floor," said the Lieu
tenant Governor, and again the gavels
banged.
"I move this session adjourn,"
shouted Senator Morgan.
"It is moved that this session ad
journ," shouted the Lieutenant Gov
ernor.

PHILADELPHIA, Jan. Â«.âThe re
port that Philadelphia attorneys are

knows of no new pr* -eedings. Attor
neys of Philadelphia who prepared the

Disavowal of any intention to take
part in a canonical prosecution of
Bishop Talbot was made to-day by

to withdraw the charges in writing
they had signed in the effort to obtain

entire matter; Dr. Arnold said that he
never again will be mixed up in an af

Unabfe to Attain
Top of Social
Ladder.
LONDON, Jan. 6.âEnglish society
drawing-rooms will not see much of the
Duchess of Manchester for some time.
Those who knew her well are not sur
prised that she has decided to remain
for an indefinite period in her own
country. She had gone to enormous
expense in the hope of being able some
day to entertain royalty only to' be dis
appointed.
It was publicly announced that the
King and Queen were to be entertained
at Kylemore Castle when they visited f
Ireland, but they did not go there; in
fact, their Majesties carefully avoided
the West of Ireland, although it was
included in their original programme.
It was stated at the time that their
non-appearance at Kylemore was due
to the fact that the structural altera
tions at the castle could not be com
pleted in time, but it is now said that
they were delayed Intentionally, when
it was found that the King and Queen
were not going there, so as to escape
the inference that the Duchess had
been snubbed.
When it was announced some time ago
that the Prince of Wales proposed to
visit Ireland early this year, the
Duchess and her friends exercised all
their powers to get the heir apparent
to go to Kylemore, but Lord Ardilaun,
the big Dublin brewer, stepped in and
said in effect: "No, George, you must
come and stay with me." And so the
Prince is going to put up at Ashford,
a place not half so beautiful as Kyle
more.
There are several reasons put forth
to explain why the Duchess of Man
chester has never succeeded in getting
to the top of the social ladder. Disre
garding the old adage aoout doing in
RomÂ« as the Romans do, she has re
fused to participate in the gambling
games so popular in swell society, and
has been rather outspoken in express
ing her disapproval of the devotion to
bridge for high stakes displayed by
certain patrician dames who are in
high favor with the King.
It is said,"too, that when she first
came to England as the wife of the
Duke she assumed airs of superiority
that gave offense to the smart set who
were averse to taking lessons In pro
priety from a Cincinnati girl. Conse
quently they did their best to thwart
her social ambitions and are flattering
themselves that they have succeeded.
They say now that it Is pique which
has caused her to return to America
and take the Duke with her.

BRIAN GUEST
AT A BANQUET
MEMPHIS, Term., Jan. 6.âA banquet
at which 400 covers were spread was
tendered William J. Bryan to-night by
the Jackson Club of Memphis, Bryan
was introduced as the next President
of the United States. His subject was
"Watchman, What of the Night?"
After speaking of the causes which
in part contributed to the recent de
feat of the Democratic party, Bryan
said the platform adopted at Kansas
City expressed the views of more Dem
ocrats than any platform adopted
since. He praised several recommenda
tions made by President Roosevelt and
spoke of him as doing many good
things. Bryan closed as follows:
"Just now President Roosevelt gives
promise of beginning a reform move
ment. He recommends legislation
which will inform the public in regard
to campaign contributions. This is a
far-reaching recommendation and
should receive the earnest support of
every Democrat. He also recommends
an enlargement of the scope of the in
terstate commerce laws. This, too, is a
step in the right direction, and he
should receive the support of all Demo
crats in any efforts which he makes to
bring the railroads under a strict con
trol. If the President, with the aid of
the Democrats, accomplishes any re
form the public will secure <he benefit
of it; if, even with Democratic aid, he
fails, the educational work which he
does will help the Democratic party in
future contests.
"In municipal affairs the Democrats
are, as they should be, quite unanimous
in favor of municipal ownership of all
municipal franchises, and our party
must face the fact that a failure prop
erly to regulate the railroads will com
pel the public ownership of the rail
roads. If the Federal Government
operates only the trunk lines, leaving
the States to operate the network of
local lines, we can have public owner
ship without centralization, and, as I
believe, without danger to any public
interests."

NEW YEAR CLASH.
In Midst of Festivities Japanese En
gage the Russians.
' MUKDEN, Jan. 6.âThe Japanese
tried to combine business with pleas
ure, and while their new year festivi
ties were in progress on January 2
made an attack upon the village of
Vito, in front of one of their positions, j
The Russians replied with artillery on
.the right and the center, and prevented ]
the Japanese from occupying the vil-j
lage.
The same night a party of Siberian
volunteers surrounded the village of
rilnlounto-vvn, which the Japanese had
been using as a signal station. While
one column made an attack on the left
front, three others, in command of
Captain Toviansky, rushed the rear of
the village without firing and caught
the Japanese unexpectedly,driving them
out. Subsequently the Japanese opened
a heavy fire from the neighboring hills,
which compelled the Russians to retire
from the village. They carried off
twelve prisoners, seven of whom were
wounded. The Russian loss was nine
killed. It is not known to what extent
the Japanese suffered, but Judging by
â¢ the number of rifles abandoned ther
must have been many killed or
wounded.

CHRISTMAS IN RUSSIA.
â¢Jollity Not Affected by Fall of Port
Arthur.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 6âThis is
the Russian Christmas eve. The streets
have been filled all day with crowds of
shoppers and the markets, overflowing
their customary bounds, filled adjoining
streets with booths and stalls, where
every variety of Christmas trees were
. piled high. Apparently the fall of Port
Arthur had little effect on the jollity
of the Christmas crowds. Promptly at
midniÃht everything closed up and the J
city became instantly dark and the
streets were deserted, but really for a

SQUADRON NOT TO GO FAR.
Indications of Change of Plans for

LONDON, Jan. 7. âThe Times learns
that there is no evidence that supplies
have been arranged for the Russian
second Pacific squadron beyond Diego
Suarez Bay and that charters for poal
arid provisions for points beyond have
' been canceled.
It is still more significant, the
Times says, that the Russian Gov
ernment has canceled contracts for

from Libau to the East Indian archi
pelago and Saigon. The only Infer

Both Nations Ready
to Continue the
Game of War.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.âJapan has
made no overtures for peace to Russia,
directly or indirectly, through the
United States or any other power, and
contemplates no such action, and now,
that Port Arthur has fallen, purposes
to press the war in the north all the
more vigorously by reinforcing the
Japanese armies at Liaoyang with the
greater part 'Of the troops which have
been besieging Port Arthur.
This, in brief, represents the views
of Mr. Takahira, the Japanese Min
ister.
' The fall of Port Arthur,' said the
Minister, "is but a step in the war
which Japan is waging for a principle.
Certainly it is an important step, but
nothing could be further from the
truth than the assumption that be
cause Japan has captured a stronghold,
the fall of which has long been expect- 1
ed, the Japanese Government will now
make overtures for peace. Japan is too
busy lighting. We are as much in
earnest to-day as we were at the out
set of the war. We have made no over
tures for peace, either directly or Indi
rectly, nor have the powers approached
us with any idea of intervention."
At the Russian Embassy it was re
iterated that Russia would fight all the
harder in view of the temporary loss of
Port Arthur.
Europe, it is learned, is firmly of the
conviction that however dark the out
look for peace at this moment, when
the prospect brightens it is to Presi
dent Roosevelt that the neutrals as
well as the belligerents will look as the
intermediary through whom peace ne
gotiations will be initiated. As a Euro
pean Embassador said to-day, the
American Government is practically
the only Government to which both
belligerents will be willing to look for
assistance in reaching a settlement
when the time comes, and aside from
this fact the high personal regard in
which the President is held, both at
St. Petersburg and at Tokio, makes it
all the more probable that through
him, when Russia and Japan have
fought their fight, the powers must
hope for peace.
MAY FLOAT SHIPS.
No Official Inspection Yet Made at'
Port Arthur, However.
TOKIO, Jan. 6.âThe Navy Department
announces that the Japanese naval
force at Port Arthur has sunk the fol
lowing Russian war vessels in that har
bor: Torpedo-boats, the Gaidamak and
Fusatonik; torpedo-boat destroyers, the
Jetirny, Sisik and Boevoi.
The armored cruiser Bayan is lying
on the south coast of the harbor se
verely damaged and the gunboat Bobr
is entirely burned as the result of the
Japanese shelling.
The Russian battleships sunk at Port
Arthur have not as yet been officially
inspected. In those destroyed by the
Russians at tHe last moment there are
no signs of interior explosions. It is
hoped that the damage done to them
will be repairable. The docks are par
tially destroyed and filled In, the gates
also being damaged. The great crane
is intact and serviceable.
KUROPATKIN INFORMED.
Oyama Lets Him Know of Fall of

BERLIN, Jan. 6.âThe Lokal An

patch dated January 6 says: Field
Marshal Oyama has sent a letter to
General Kuropatkin communicating the
news of the capitulation of Port Ar
thur and praising the bravery of its de
fenders.
The effect of the news was especially
confounding, last reports Indicating a
strong resistance. It is believed tt will
immediately affect the situation on the
Shakhe. Continued intense cannonad
ing has been heard since dawn near
Sinchinpu and Shakhe. A resumption
of the cannonading to-morrow is ex

begged to be allowed to present to
General Nogl his favorite Arabian

declined personal acceptance, pointing
out that it came under the category
of war material to be surrendered, but
he consented to accept the animal in
the name of the Japanese army.

Port Arthurs Fall
Due to Lack of
Ammunition.
LONDON, Jan. 7.âAccording to the |
Daily Mail's correspondent at Chefu,
Baron Kleist, a Russian naval officer, 1
says lack of ammunition was the main
lactor in determining the surrender of
Port Arthur and that since September,
when the first general order was issued ;
announcing a scarcity, the greatest
economy was exercised.
Baron Kleist says the Japanese b>e
on the forts was so accurate that the
men regarded an order to serve in a j
fort as a sentence to death. Many died
without visible wounds, from the mere
violence of the concussion of huge Jap
anese shells, which made blood burst
from the eyes, mouth and nostrils of
those standing near. Early in the
siege the ranks of the Russian artil
lery were so depleted that Infantrymen
had to be employed to serve the guns, j
ANCESTRY OF STOESSEL.
Family Originally German, but Forced
From the Country.
OMAHA, Jan. 6.â J. S. Weidemeyer,
foreman of the Union Pacific shops
here, sets at rest a dispute which has
been going the rounds of the European
papers with respect to the ancestry of
General Anatole M. Stoessel, the Rus
sian commander at Port Arthur. Fore
man Weidemeyer studied mechanics in
Switzerland with two brothers of Stoes
sel. He said to-day that the claims of
both Germans and Swedes that the
hero of Port Arthur is of their nation
ality are In a sense right.
Tho Stoesseis, he declares, were jon
the losing side in the thirty years' war
and General Stoessel's ancestor was
forced to flee from Germany. He set
tled in Sweden, but his son went to
Russia and entered the army. For
many years in both Germany and Rus
sia many members of the family have
been military men.
RUSSIAN GUNS BOOM.

Near Mukden.
GENERAL OKU'S HEADQUAR- !
TBRS, Jan. 6. via Fusan/âDuring the
last three days the Russian bombard
ment has been heavier than at any
time during the past six weeks. For two
days following the receipt of the news of
General Stoessel's letter to General
Nogi offering to surrender Port Arthur
hardly a. shot was fired, but since then
many heavy guns have been brought
into use and there is almost constant
firing.
There is no indication of the meaning
of this activity on the part of the Rus
sians. Apart from this conditions at
the front remain unchanged. The Japa
nese are using searchlights. . j
There is great rejoicing among the
Japanese troops over the fall of Port
Arthur, and celebrations take place
every night.

BISHOP SPALDING SUFFERS
SEVERE PARALYTIC STROKE
Distinguished Catholic Prelate Is Sud

His Condition Serious.
PEORIA, 111., Jan. 6.âBishop John
L. Spalding of the Roman Catholic
church to-day suffered a severe para
lytic stroke. His brother, Dr. Leonard
H. Spalding, is by his side continually.
The Bishop is 65 years of age, and
while he has been in fair health all
his life, his age tends to add to the
fear of his friends for another and more
serious attack. He complained this
morning that he was suffering with a
slight attack of neuralgia, but nothing
more was thought about it. About 4
o'clock his housekeeper was startled by
the sound of a fall in - the Bishop's
room. She ran hastily to the place and
found him lying on the floor, partially
unconscious and unable to rise.
At a late hour he' is resting com- |
f ortably.

BARD OPPOSES
THE MEASURE
California's Junior Senator
Argues Against Union of
Arizona and New Mexico
ADDRESSES COLLEAGUES
Gives His Assent to Proposi
tion to Consolidate Okla
homa and Indian Territory
Special Dispatch to The Call.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.âSenator
Bard to-day occupied the entire time
of the* Senate given to the Joint state
hood bill.
Senator Bard presented a masterly
argument on behalf of Arizona in her
plea for the integrity of her boun
daries, that she be not forced to join
another Territory in order to become
a State. He followed the story of the
admission of Territories since Wiscon
sin and showed that in the case of
Arizona the act creating the Territory
distinctly proved, as it did in no
other case, that while its area might
be divided it could not be added to.
Bard long ago took the initiative on
the Republican side against this plan
of making one State of Arizona and
New Mexico together and has kept up
such a persistent and aggressive fight
that he lias come to assume the posi
tion of the leadership of the opposition
how that the bill is fairly before the
Senate. It is largely due to his efforts
that the lively interest of a number of
Republican Senators, including, lately,
Senator Foraker, has been enlisted
against it. During the delivery of his
speech this afternoon Senator Bard
held the closest attention of the Senate,
the chamber being nearly full and the
Democrats occupying what vacant
seats were to be found on the Repub
lican side.
At the conclusion the members crowd
ed about to shake Senator Bard by the
hand and congratulate him upon his
forceful espousal of the cause he has
at heart.
Bard began by reciting the history of
the pending bill, which had grown out
of earlier and separate hilts providing
for the introduction of Arizona and of
New Mexico as separate States, and
showing that the people of neither Ter
ritory had ever applied through their
Representatives or otherwise for state
hood other than as separate States. He
declared that no bill would come before
the session more important than this
statehood bill, affecting as it does the
destinies of a million of our American
people, and proposing to terminate the
control of Congress over the only con
tiguous territory belonging to the
United States.
Senator Bard said in part:
The creation of new States has often marked
some Important Â«poch In the political history
of our nation, and too frequently has signified
the accomplishment of some selfish scheme' of
a political part? which at the time controlled
the Government. - There does not appear to be
any circumstances by which either of the
great, political parties of this day can secure
any sure advantage by either the enactment
or defeat of this measure: and I believe that
the Senators cannot be persuaded to let any
hope for political advantage to either of the
parties, whose representatives are supposed to
be divided by the central aisle of this cham
ber, prevent them from considering this meas
ure only on the higher plane of duty to the
republic and to the people most directly Inter
ested In It. I have no objections to the pro
posed Joining of Oklahoma and Indian Territory
to make a State of the Union, but I believe it
would be more consistent with'the principles
of our Government to permit the people of each
of. the Territories, separately, to vote upon the
proposition and to require a vote of a majority
of the qualified electors of each Territory to
ratify the proposed constitution of the new
State.
Bard then recited the conditions ex
isting in the Territories, their immense
area and compared them In this respect
to their neighbors and to the Eastern
States. He recited the testimony of the
Delegates from the- Territories in pro
test, as well as their Governors and
representative citizens, who said that
the people were united in their desire
for statehood, but equally united
against It on the terms proposed.
Continuing Senator Bard said:
The Territories of Arizona and New Mexico
are in a chaotic state and entitled sooner or
later to become members of the Union of
States. If they are not yet prepared for
statehood Congress may Justly deny their ap
plication, but Congress cannot Justly unite
them if the proper political equilibrium of the
various sections of the country is to be pre
â¢â¢rved.
The people of Arizona, particularly, are
earnestly protesting against the passage Of
this, measure. Through the fear of conse
quences' and Injury which the bill would in
flict Â«'f>eh them, they have abandoned all hope
that Congress will at this time give Arizona
st i arate statehood, though such has been their
| afnbttton for a whole generation. In surren
j dering this hope now Arizona begs, but begs in
| a manner. that is dignified, though intensely
| earnest, that she may be spared the degrada-
I tion of the loss of her separate autonomy and
identity, and the humiliation of having her
boundaries forever effaced, and forgetting in
her distress the rights that she may claim, al
most pitifully says: "Rather than Incur the
impending disaster of a Joint statehood with
New 1 Mexico we request Congress to allow u<Â»
to remain as a Territory of the United States."
I On the conclusion of Bard's remarks
the bill temporarily was laid aside and
j the Senate went into executive session.
After the doors were reopened the
reading of the omnibus claims bill was
completed and after passing a few bills
oit minor Importance the Senate ad
journed until Monday.

(Continued from Page 1, Column 4.)
"The session will not adjourn and
members will keep their seats," called
the Speaker.
SENATORS LEAVE HOUSE.
"All in favor of adjourning will say
'aye,'" called the Lieutenant Gov
ernor. "All opposed, 'no.' "
The "ayes" and "noes" came in
about equal volume and then down !
came the gavel of the Lieutenant Gov
ernor with a vicious slam.
"The ayes have it and the session is
dissolved."
Whack! went the Speaker's gavel.
"The noes have it and the session is ,
not dissolved," he said.
"The members of the Senate will
leave the House," said the Lieutenant
Governor, and quickly walking from
the Speaker's stand he strode up the
aisle waving his gavel over his head
as though he was leading an infantry
charge. |
All the Democratic Senators and a
number .of the Republican Senators
followed him.
Several Republican Senators re
mained in (he House and took part in
the proceedings held there until the
filial adjournment.
The doors were then locked and no 1
member was permitted to pass out.
Again and again Representative
Frewen raised the point of order that
no proper joint session was being held,
and every time the speaker declared
him out of order.
Representative Griffith then pre- '
sented the protest from Governor Pea
body, which was read by the clerk. It
covered the history of the recent elec
tion in Denver and suggested to the
Legislature that it was the duty of
that body to make a complete inves
tigation of the election. It protested i
against the canvass of the votes until
the investigation had been completed
and the number of legal votes for each
candidate had been ascertained.
GOVERNOR'S PROTEST READ.
Accompanying the protest was a res
olution presented by Griffith urging the
appointment of a committee of ten from
the House and five from the Senate to
investigate the vote and report daily to
the Legislature, with a final report not
later than Monday afternoon.
The reading of the Governor's protest
lasted but about a minute, when Rep
resentative Frewen raised the point of !
order that it was not germaln to any
subject under consideration. He was
declared out of order, raised his point
of order again and once more was de
clared out of order. He appealed from
the decision of the chair and the Speak- .
er refused to hear his appeal.
Representative Street moved an ad- â¢
journment and the Speaker would
entertain it. Street insisted that, hie
motion was in order according tc the
rules. He was informed by the Speak
er that this was a Joint session and no
rules had been adopted for the control
of a Joint session.
After the reading of the resolution
Griffith demanded a roll call. On its
adoption several members made
speeches explaining their views, the
Republican Senator Morgan declaring
that he only voted "aye" because he
did not wish to ally himself with the
Democratic party, but he wished to say
that the presiding officer of the Senate
had been insulted by the House. The
resolution was adopted by a vote of 51
ayes and d no, the negative vote being
cast by the Republican Senator Wood.
Seventeen Republican Senators were
present and voted for the resolution.
Throughout the roll call Representative
Street constantly urged the point of or- i
der that no quorum was present and ;
was constantly declared out of order.
Street finally sat down. After the
adoption of the Griffith resolution a
motion to dissolve the joint session was
carried. Speaker Dickson then called
the House to order and it promptly ad
journed.
Lieutenant Governor Haggott and his
followers assort to-night that five of
the Republican Senators who were in
the joint session to-day will remain
away to-morrow and prevent a
quorum.
The Wolcott Republicans, whose
leader is Lieutenant Governor Haggott,
have demanded certain concessions |
from the Peabody people as the price |
of their assistance. These things are
reported to be the privilege of naming
the two new Justices of the Supreme
Court and getting half the Guberna
torial patronage. The Peabody people
are not willing to-night to agree to the
request.

MISSOURI LEGISLATURE.
Famous "Alum Bill" Is First Measure
Introduced in the House.
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo.,' Jan. 6.â
"When the Legislature convened to-day
the first bill introduced In the House
was the famous "alum bill." This bill
is to repeal the law prohibiting the
use of alum In the manufacture of
baking powder. The statute was en
acted during the 1899 session of the
Legislature. In 1901 and again in 1903
efforts were made to repeal it, but ac
tion was blocked each time. An inves
tigation by Attorney General Crow re
sulted in the indictment of several
Senators on the charge of having ac
cepted bribes to prevent the repeal of
the statute. During the investigation
Lieutenant Governor John A. Lee re

WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.âCongress
will be asked the last week of this month
by the House Committee on Naval
Affairs to authorize the building of
two battleships, two scout cruisers, six
torpedo-boat destroyers and a few
smaller craft of light draught for the
insular service. This statement is
made on authority which cannot be
questioned, and it makes known to-day
for the first time to Just what extent
the economical Intended changes will
be asked to provide money for new
ships for the navy.
It can be stated to-day as a fact not
hitherto known outside of the commit
tee that $5,000,000 was cut out of the
bill prior to the Christmas holidays.
Within a few days at least $3,000,000
more will be excised. The cuts have
been made largely In the navy-yard
section of the appropriation. It Is felt
by Chairman Foss that the navy-yard
can best stand on the waiting list of
money applicants. The amounts al
ready cut out and to be cut out will
reduce the first estimate of the appro
priation to about $109,000,000. Other re
ductions will be made, and the bill as
it will go to the House will call for
about $103,000,000, or $6,000,000 more than
was appropriated last year.

ONE LIVES IN OAKLAND
Former San Francisco 3linis
ter Avers He Was Cleared
of Charge in Santa Cruz
Special DUpatch to The Call.
SPOKANE. Jan. 6.âRev. Frederick
Bell, formerly of San Francisco and
now pastor of Humanity's Church, de
clares he will bring suits against three
preachers who he says have been de
faming his character In asserting that
he was convicted of bigamy and is now
living unlawfully with his wife. He
Bays:
"While In Santa Cruz I was arrested
for bigamy, tried and found guilty, but
the court set aside the verdict, believ
ing that there was no intent to violate
the law." Dr. Bell says he fully be
lieved his former wife was dead when
he married his present wife. After
learning that his first wife was alive
he secured a divorce and remarried his
present helpmate.
The preachers accused of defaming
Bell are Rev. E. C. Downey and Rev.
J. A. Crusan of Spokane and Rev. Mr.
Stone of Oakland; Cal. Rev. Mr. Cru
san says:
"All I know of Dr. Bell Is what I
have read in Santa jCruz and San Fran
cisco papers regarding his trial on the
charge of bigamy and what was told
me by the Rev. Mr. Stone, who was
a resident of Santa Cruz at the time.
If the telling of facts which have al"
ready been made public property
through the columns of the press M
criminal libel, then I am guilty."

A CONTAGIOUS DISEASE
BOSTON, Jan. 6.âThe Advertiser to
morrow will say that the Harvard
medical commission, which for the past
two years has been making a study of
cancer, will, In Its report to be made

cancer is not infectious; second, it is a
hereditary affliction; third, its cause la
as mysterious as that of human life;
fourth, the remedies are either a knife
or a serum.
Dr. E. H. Nichols is at the head of
the commission, which was made pos

cal school $100,000, the Interest of which

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 7, 1905.
Special DisWh to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 6.âOnce more
Speaker Prescott has postponed the
announcement of the Assembly com
! mittees and the members of the lower
house will be kept in suspense a few
days longer regarding who will be on
and who will head the various commit
, tees.
When the Assembly convened this
morning there was much expectation,
as many of the Assemblymen were
in doubt as to how they had finally
been placed and were anxious for the
announcement that was expected.
Speaker Prescott begged the indul
gence of the Assembly and said he
would have to postpone the announce
i ment of committees until Monday
morning, as he had been unable to
solve the nuzzle of fitting more than
one man into any one place.
As a matter of fact, so it is said, the
â  postponement was made by order of
Governor Pardee, who sent word to
Speaker Prescott âand "profane word,"
too, so it was rumored on the floorâ
that he was not yet satisfied and
wished the announcements withheld.
There are many conjectures as to
just what dissatisfies the Governor
with the arrangements of committees
up to date âthe supposition that the
Senatorial fight has something to do
with It of course being given promi
nence, but there are other matters that
are important to the Governor and
these have as much as anything else
to do with his interference.
In the first place the Governor is
very particular about the "Ways and
Means Committee, which has so much
to do with public expenditure and con
sequently the tax rate. It is said he
did not specially favor Stanton for
chairman of this committee, but is
willing he should get the place, pro
viding: the other two members are sat
isfied.
Then there is the new Committee on
Taxation which is of great importance
to the administration, for by it the
proposed new tax legislation, dear to
the Governor's heart, will be consid
ered. Goodrich was selected as chair
man of this committee in the House,
but It was learned that Hahn was to
be chairman of the Senate Committee
on Taxation. Both are from Pasadena,
and it would hardly be proper that any
one city should have the chairmanship
of one committee in both houses. Hahn
will be induced to withdraw, as he does
not care about the place, and Goodrich
will be named in the Assembly.
Assemblyman Moore of San Joaquin
is said to have a special complaint
against the Speaker. He has openly
declared himself for Knight, and it is
said by other anti-Flint Assemblymen
that he is having difficulty in getting
such committee recognition as he de
sires.
There is a story out to the effect that
Senator Muenter and Assemblyman
Beardslee, both of San Joaquin, have
come to Moore's rescue and declared
that if he is not treated with the con
sideration he and they think is due
him they will desert the Flint ranks.
None of the San Joaquin legislators
will make a statement for publication,
but the story of their alleged troubles
comes from colleagues

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 6.âThe scene of
the Senatorial contest has shifted from
here to San Francisco. The- exodus of
the men that make laws and Senators
began this morning and continued until
the last train bayward moved out. The
town seems deserted to-night and it
will remain so until at /least Sunday
j evening, when the legislators are ex
pected bark, all properly instructed by
their "constituents" as to how they
are to stand when the vote for United
States Senator is called.
The principal topic of conversation
to-day is Speaker Prescott's announce
ment of fealty to the cause of Frank
P. Flint. While it is true that Pres
cott denies that he came here as a
Bard man, asserting that he left his
home as a free lance with only one
purpose in mmd âthe election of some
man from the south to the United
States Senateâthe supporters of Bard,
though they are not depressed in the
least at what they term Prescott's "un
explained deflection," say the records
will show that he was elected by voters
laboring under the impression that he
would support Bard first and last.
As a basis for their claim they point
to the minutes of the San Bernardino
County convention that nominated
Prescott for the Assembly. Though
there was no anti-Bard sentiment ex
pressed at the convention Senator
Bard's friends, who were in control,
deemed It advisable to indorse the can
didacy of the incumbent for re-election
and as a result the following strong
resolution was unanimously adopted:
BARD IS INDORSED.
We "specially lnJorse and approve of the
work of the Hon. Thomaa R. Bam in the
United State* Senate, where Vie has tiken rank
with the leading: men in that most notable
legislative body on earth, and where he has
proved his ability, his forceful courage and his
character by standing for what he believed to
bÂ« in the Interests of California In the face of
the most powerful opposition that could be ar
rived against him.
We believe that such signal effort on behalf
of the State which he represents should call for
a warm and enthusiastic response Horn the In
terests which he has thus sought to benefit.
Not only so, but his position at the head of the
â¢ 'ommittee on Irrigation, where he will control
the expenditure of millions of dollars in this
and In adjoining and tributary States and Ter
ritories, furnished additional reason why he
whould be continued as one of the representa
tives of California In the Senate at Washing
ton.
We therefore believe that he is the choice of
the Republicans of this county as hlÂ» own
â uccessor.
By virtue, of a nomination placed in
his hands by the convention that pass
.cd this resolution Prescott went before
the voters of his counfcy and was elect
ed. Senator Bard's supporters say there
could be no stronger indorsement of
Senator Bard than that contained in
this resolution and it is claimed by
some of Bard's friends that after Pres
cott's nomination he said he considered
this resolution binding upon him and
that a direct pledge could have been
no more forceful.
HEADQUARTERS DARK.
Speaker Prescott denies that he so
held, however, and it is a question
difficult to determine. Senator Bard's
friends, however, have the last word
in the discussion when they say that
in any the resolution of indorse
ment of Senator Bard's candidacy,
which will admit of no misconstruction
and plainly expresses the desire of the
voters of San Bernardino, has been
rendered purposeless and robbed of all
effect by Speaker Prescott's confession i
that he is intrenched In the camp of
Frank P. Flint. Thus have the de
sires of the men that composed the
San Bernardino convention been de
feated.
The headquarters of the candidates
for the Senatorship were dark to-night,
all appreciating the fact that more
work could be accomplished in San
Francisco than here. There is much
talk of the arrival here upon the trains
with the returning legislators and
avowed candidates of a number of dark
horses, who, to use the expression of
Candidate Arthur Fisk, will be in a
"receptive" mood. These dark horses,
it is pointed out. are looking for a
deadlock In the south and a concen
tration of opposition against the north
ern men that have announced them
selves as in the fight. They must get
in early, however, for California legis
lators are noted for their shyness un
less the dark horse Is full of promises
and is able "to show them why."
The Electoral College of California
will be the center of interest in the
Assembly chamber next Monday after
noon. After the formality of balloting
for President and Vice President of the
United States is concluded the mem- j
bers of the college will select one of I
their number to carry the ballot to
Washington. The impression prevails
here that George H. Pippy will be thus '
honored, but a fight may develop when
the members get together and ambition
is aroused by contemplation of the
dignity that attaches to the office.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 6.âComment- j
me on the sudden change of front of j
General Prescott, the Los Angeles :
Times will to-morrow say editorially: I
When a Senator or an Assemblyman !
goes to the State Legislature unin- J
structed and unpledged he has the full- j
est freedom of action, and may vote j
for measures or for men according to |
the best (or the worst) dictates of his j
own conscience. But the case is differ
ent when a member of the Legislature j
goes to that body under instructions
or under a pledge to perform a certain
action.
Frank C. Prescott, now Speaker of
the California Assembly, was not spe
cifically instructed to vote for Thomas
R. Bard for United States Senator, but
he was elected with the understanding
that he would support Senator Bard
for re-election to the Senate. His con- |
stituents so understoodâat least the !
majority of them didâand to certain j
persons Mr. Prescott positively pledged
himself to the support of Mr. Bard.
Now Prescott comes out, to the amaze- j
ment of everybody, and announces ;
that he is a supporter of Frank P.
Flint for the Senatorial toga. It would
be interesting to learnâif the inside j
facts were attainableâjust what in- j
fluences have been brought to bear
upon Mr. Prescott to induce him to en
act the role of a turncoat.
His selection for the Speakership was j
a surprise hardly less than that of his !
flop to Flint. While it is not openly j
charged that there was any connection
between these two events, there are
those who profess to find such a con- !
nection as the only plausible explana- j
tion of his singular change of front.
At any rate, It is apparent beyond all
controversy that Speaker Prescott has 1
proved recreant to his pledges in behalf |
of Senator Bard, though in \deserting i
the Bard standard he may have kept i
promises made to others whom It Is not '
necessary to name. His recreancy, it is j
true, is no crime in a legal sense. But i
it is a moral crime and a political of
feme which his constituents whom he
has betrayed will be slow to forget. No i
holder of a public office who is found to
be untrustworthy and Janus-faced is
likely to be given a chance to hold of- ;
flee aft*r his perfidy has been found out. j
The perfidy of Mr. Prescott will give to j
Flint one more vote. It will not ma
terially affect the Senatorial situation.
But it will materially affect the politi- j
cal status of Mr. Prescott. as he will
discover later on.
TRACED SOOTH
FROM THIS CITY
More Light on Movements of
31 rs. Bishop. Who 31 ay Be
Cutler Mountain Victim
Special Difpatch to The Call.
COLORADO SPRINGS. Jan. 6.âln
following up the connection of Mrs.
Augusta I. Bishop's name with the
Mount Cutler tragedy, some circum
stances tending to support the theory
that she was the victim have been un
earthed, although there is some con
fusion in the name. A Mrs. K. E.
Bishop was in Cheyenne Canyon on
November IS in company with a man,
who was evidently a stranger to her.
The couple called at the photograph
studio of J. M. Haves, keeper of the
tollgate. and a picture of the woman
was made by Haves' assistant, J. R.
Miller. Mrs. Bishop wanted her escort
to have his picture taken with heT,
but he refused.
Miller describes Mrs. Bishop as a
woman about five feet three inches in
height, about 125 pounds in weight and
with hair the color of the murdered
woman. She displayed many diamonds
in the studio. She was neatly dressed
and wore a. long coat and a cap. Her
general description tallies with that of
the murdered woman.
Miller is unable to say whether there
was gold in the woman's teeth. The
addrifss left by Mrs. Bishop for the for
warding of the photographs waa the
Palace Hotel, San Francisco. She asked
that they be mailed on November 16. No
word has ever been received from San
Francisco as to whether she ever re
ceived the pictures.
A man and woman, registering as
Mr. and Mrs. K. D. Bishop of Cleve
land, arrived at the Palace Hotel In
this city'on November 18 and departed
a short time later for Los Angeles. The
woman's description, according to the
statement of one of the clerks of the
Palace, corresponded with that con
tained in the above dispatch. The
couple, before leaving, said their des
tination was Los Angeles and they re
quested that any mail that might ar
rive for them be forwarded to the An
gelus Hotel in that city.
Later they sent another request to
the Palace to have their mail forward
ed to the same address, but as far as

WASHINGTON. Jan. 6.âThe nomi
nation of W. D. Crum, a negro, to be
Collector of Customs for the port of
Charleston, S. C, was confirmed by the
Senate in executive session to-day by a
vote of 33 to 17. Crum had been nomi
nated by the President three times and

a recess appointment when no actual
recess had occurred, the Senate having
adjourned one session and begun
another at noon of the same day.
The race issue played a very insig
nificant part in the debate, which was
participated in by fully a dosen Sen

twenty-two new gold dredgers, already
arranged for, will be operated in the
lower stream. This information is de
rived from W. W. Waggoner, State De
bris Commissioner. A great electric
power has been projected, which can
be utilized in the operation of
this fleet of mechanical gold extract
ors. The Hammon Company is con
structing five dredgers on the Yuba
now, and is working two others. At
least 15,000 horsepower will be gener
ated by damming the narrows of the
Yuba to the height of 150 feet. Wag
goner says it will be possible to dredge
the. present bed of the river from the
Narrows to Daguerre Point. The dam
will cost between $500,000 and $800,000.
The Redding Free Press says that at
French Gulch, Shasta County, 125 men
are employed in the Gladstone mine.
The mill and .mine are running with
electric power. The present total depth
of the mine is 1000 feet.
The third smelter for Shasta County
Is about to be constructed. In antici
pation the Southern Pacific Company
has run a spur track to the smelter site
of the Mammoth Copper Company at
Kennett. The machinery for the smelt
er is being made in the East. Kennett
is growing rapidly.
The Scott Valley Advance reports
that rain and snow have raised the wa
ter hi many mountain streams in Sis
kiyou County sufficiently to permit hy
draulic and placer mines to begin ope
rations. The Cherry Hill mine, which
has been closed on account of litiga
tion, has been reopened and an 1800
--foot tunnel is in construction to tap
the vein at a depth of about 1200 feet.
Mines In the county that have been
closed are preparing to resume. The
mining conditions are consequently im
proved.
MAKING DEVELOPMENTS.
The Santa Fe and Dewey placer
claims at Canada Hill, Placer County,
will be worked, a company having re
cently been formed for that purpose.
Phosphate is reported to have been
discovered in the Grapevine district,
east of Banner, San Diego County, in
paying quantities, occurring in apatite
and other formations in several parallel
ledges. Two thousand acres have been
located by the discoverer.
According to Kern County advices,
H. H. Blood of San Francisco has thir
ty-five men working in the Zada mine
in the Amalie district. Twenty men
are working in the same district in the
Barbarossa mine. J. B. Ferris of Cali
ent* has organized a company to oper
ate the Bright Star mine in the Pinto
district, adjoining the Amalie.
â¢A new smelter will be built by the
Mount Whipple and Copper Basin
mining companies on the Colorado
River, in San Bernardino County, thir
ty miles south of Needles.
A small mining boom is reported in
Vallecito, Calaveras County. A pocket
of gold was recently found in a gulch
through which the people of Calaveras
County had been passing for many
years without entertaining a suspicion
that there was any gold in the imme
diate neighborhood. The pocket yield
ed $500. In the vicinity a large quan
tity of milling quarts has been found
since the pocket came to light and a
small quartz mill has been erected to
crush the rock that has been taken
out. Gravel mining has been done near
the place, but on a small scale. The
Prospect says:
A very â¢mall part of the rich ancient river
channel la being worked by the drifting pro
cess In the Douglas Flat and Vallecito min
ing district, which aids considerable In keep
ing alive the mining industry and Insuring
a small snug fortune for the few who ara
engaged in this class of placer mining. The
owners of the Douglas Flat '40 ancient river
bed placer mine are hoisting pay gravel now.
The Sloan brothers are drifting out bonanza
gravel from their ancient river bed placer
mine in Balaklava Mountain. The old river
bed here ran across a small lime rock range
which, strange to say, drains all the channel
water from the pay gravel and leaves It as
â ry and nice as plowed land, although the
bed of the old river at this place Is nearly
three hundred feet below the apex of the
mountain.
A large project is reported in the
Ouanacevle district in Mexico, Involving
an outlay of $5,000,000. A company has
secured a grant of 9000 acres and will
tunnel 10,000 feet through a mountain
at a distance of 2200 feet below the sur
face to tap veins of gold, silver and
copper. The Guanacevie district is re
ported to be the most thoroughly mined
section in Mexico. It takes In a terri
tory of six miles long and four miles
wide.
LOS ANGELES MINERS.
The Los Angeles Times reports that
a mining company has been organized
to operate mining properties In Lower
California, forty miles east of Ensen
ada, In the bed of a river. Two other
Los Angeles companies have been or
ganized to work on properties Just
across the line from Imperial.

SCOTT'S EMULSION.
HAD TO HIDE IT
A mother wrote us recently
that she had to keep Scott's
Emulsion under lock and key
âher children used to drink
it whenever her back was
turned. Strange that children
should like something that is
so good for them. It's usu
ally the other way. Scott's
Emulsion makes children
comfortable, makes them fat
and rosy-cheeked. Perhaps
that's why they like it so
much âthey know it makes

UTAH'S BANNER YEAR,
'The Salt Lake Tribune, in a special
number, sums up the result of mining
operations in Utah during the past
year. The output of gold is estimated
at $6,518,036. The silver is valued at
$7,774,979; the copper at $7,221,756; the
lead at $5,020,550; the quicksilver,
amounting to 700 flasks, at $31,500. The
total as summed up in round figures is
$26,537,000. The apparent gain as com
pared with 1903, as figured out by the
Tribune, is $4,522,264. Divldents to the
amount of $4,156,000 were declared. The
Daly West paid $1,034,000 and the Sil
ver King $1,300,000. Thus one-half of
the entire sum paid in dividends must
be credited to two properties. The rec
ord for the year both for the mines and
the furnaces shows an increase In out
put.
The Tribune naturally puts its best
foot forward in its comments on the
mining statistics of the State. In part
it says:
An analysis of the exhibit reveals, an In
crease in the production of each of the metals
excepting that of silver, and In this the dim
inution is confined to less than half a million
dollars. The most striking feature of the con
trast Is that which tells of the astounding
Increase In the production of copper, nor was
it until the last quarter of the year that the
copper producers were permitted to assert the
tonnages of which their mines are capable.
The Increase in the crop of rold, notwith
standing the decadence of some of the camps
that were formerly most productive of that
metal. Is a well-defined one, while the output
of lead overwhelmed the most liberal predic
tion and exceeded all previous records.
The story of the present year is easily fore
told. Not a record established In 1904 but will
succumb to that which shall follow its close.
The most conspicuous gain will undoubtedly
be in the output of copper, and copper Is king
To that end the sinews have been provided at
the mills and furnaces; nature has supplied the
balance. That the American has ordered an
enlargement of Its plant In the valley and
that the United States Smelting Company has
consecrated a new one to the lead producer
anticipates an Increase In the output of that
metal, while that silver and gold will reveal
an increase Is foretold In the regeneration of
old camps in which those metals have always
been most prominent. Never, Indeed, has a
year of greater promise dawned upon the
camps of a commonwealth.
In the mines as well as at the furnaces
and the mills an unprecedented volume of
employment has been afforded the wage
earner, with new sources being hourly added
to those already opened to him, while the
condition throughout Is one over which every
Interest is permitted to exult as never before
In the Industrial history of the State.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. JANUARY 7. 1905.
SHARP WORDS
IN THE HOUSE
Littauer and Baker Have a
Tiff During* Discussion of
the Fortifications Bill
MEASURE IS PASSED
Question of Eemission of
Duties on War Materials
Starts a Brisk Colloquy
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.âThe House
to-day passed the fortifications bill.
After Congressman Littauer of New
York had drawn a lesson from the
siege of Port Arthur to show that sub
marine mines had proved of the great
est importance in warfare, Congress
man Baker enlivened the proceedings
by attacking the President, who, he
said, wanted to hold himself up as the
"counterpart of Wilhelm 11, the great
war god."
When the concluding paragraph of
the bill was reached, relating to the re
mission of duties on such war mate
rials as might be purchased abroad,
Baker offered an amendment striking
out that feature of the bill and in
quired of Littauer if that had been in
corporated at the request of the Secre
tary of War.
"Yes," said Littauer, "the present and
all former Secretaries."
Baker then charged that Secretary
Taft was a member of an administra
tion which advanced the proposition
that the foreigner pays the tax.
"Now, why." he Inquired, "are you
going to make this present to the for
eigner?"
Littauer responded that It was net
the time for that question to be dis
cussed.
Baker thereupon exclaimed: "Oh,
yes, it is always the time, when you
people are shown to be frauds in your
contention that the foreigner pays the
tax. That is always appropriate."
The bill was passed without amend
ment.
On motion of Grosvenor of Ohio th*
committee of the whole House was
discharged from further consideration
of the bill to revise the laws relating
to the regulation of nteam vessels and
the bill was referred back to the Com
mittee on Merchant Marine and Fish
eries.
â  The House then adjourned until Mon
day.
BACON ON THE GRILL.
Chairman of Interstate Commerce
Board Before House Committee.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 6.âThe meeting
of the House Committee on Interstate
Commerce to-day was replete with sen
sational Incidents. A hearing was given
to persons interested in the Cooper-
Quarles bill. E. P. Bacon of Milwau
kee, chairman of the Interstate Com
merce Commission, was first heard.
From the moment he took the stand
until he left it Bacon was subjected to
scathing.rebuke by Mann of Illinois
for certain statements made by him in
a publication known as Freight, as well
as in public addresses. Mann quoted
from a statement alleged to have been
made by Bacon that owing to the op
position of the majority of the two com
mittees of Congress there was no pos
sibility of legislation to further restrict
the carriers.
"Do you think that was true?" in
quired Mann.
Bacon answered that he believed It
was true at the time.
"I know," angrily replied Mann, "that
was a libel and slander. I know It was
false and I believe you knew it was
false."
Bacon calmly replied that he did not
want to be classed as a falsifier, which
only served to further anger Mann, who
.said that people who write articles
must be held responsible for what they
write.
Again reading from the publications
referred to, Mann said it was stated in
Bacon's address before the St. Louis
convention "that over three-fourths of
the Representatives in Congress owed
their presence there to the influence of
the railroads," and he asked Bacon if
that statement was his. Bacon an
swered that his remarks had been ex
temporaneous, but he had no recollec
tion of making the statement.
"I believe," said Mann, "you thought
any man in the country could go out
and libel any member of Congress. It
fortunately is true that people gener
ally pay no attention to such state
ments."
Bacon insisted he never made the
statement, but admitted saying that
four members of the House committee
had declared they would permit no ac
tion on the part of the committee on
any bill until definite action was taken
upon the Cooper-Quarles bill.
"We want to ascertain who these
four men are," demanded Mann. The
witness, however, refused to answer,
saying it would not be proper for him
to name them.
Shackleford of Missouri then indig
nantly inquired, "I ask you, sir, if Mr.
Shackleford was one of them?"
"No, sir," was the reply.
"You went over to the Elkins bill,"
said Mann, "and because the commit
tee won't follow you fast enough you
say we are under the influence of the
railways."
Bacon denied making the statement
and added that he had kept back cer
tain elements and interests in regard
to the proposed legislation.
The witness admitted that after the
revised Elkins bill was agreed upon he
had endeavored to have it become a
law.
Mann then spoke of a banquet given
at the Union League Club In Chicago
at which he said an attempt was made
to Influence him in favor of the Elkins
bill.
"I laughed at them," said. Manr..
"When they read the pooling clause of
the bill I said it had as much chance
as a snowfiake in Hades."

OUR FORESTRY
POLICY SCORED
George Maxwell, a Delegate
From California, Belabors
Congress for Inaction
LOSS IN THE MILLIONS
He Would Spend as Much on
Nation's Timber Interests
as on Forts and Navies
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.âThe Impor
tance of public forest lands to mining
was the theme of the morning meeting
of the concluding session of the Amer
ican Forest Congress. A L. Fellows,
consulting engineer of the Government
reclamation service, discussed the de
velopment of water power as related to
forest reserves. He contended that the
forest areas should be reserved by the
Government and should not be left
In the unregulated domain of the
United States.
Dr. David T. Day, chief of the di
vision of mineral resources of the
United States Geological Survey, con
tended that it was no longer necessary
to give coal, asphalt and other mineral
lands In the Government domain praN
tically free to prospectors, and said
that the Government should apply some
such regulations to govern the sales
and leases of these public mineral
lands as are applied to the lands be
longing to Indians.
MAXWELL TAKES FLOOR.
A sensational address was made by
George H. Maxwell, the executive
chairman of the National Irrigation
Congress, who spoke as a delegate from
California. He scored Congress for its
refusal to repeal the timber and stone
act and declared that the House Public
Lands Committee, the Western mem
bers of which he alleged had "delib
erately prevented action" on the meas
ure, and thus "allowed the stealing to
continue, should be held up to public
obloquy and lashed at the cart's tall
with the whip of outraged national
sentiment."
He took Issue with a statement in
President Roosevelt's address of yes
terday by saying that If the forests
were left to the West they would con
tinued to be "skinned," but added, "It
Is to Eastern sentiment and such men
as Theodore Roosevelt and Grover
Cleveland that we have forest reserves
and protection."
Continuing Maxwell said:
Last year, with 156,000 acres in the Chip
pewa Indian reservation, Minnesota, the
stumpage alone was sold, and the Government
realized Sls 06 an acre, still owning the land.
At this rate the Government has lost under
Its disposal of 3,000,000 acres through the Um
ber and atone act slnoo President Roosevelt's
message in December, 1902, recommending its
repeal, 938,578,000. besides losing control of
tbe land, but the majestic timber of Oregon
and the far Northwest, where the timber
stealing is now centered, la worth double that
of Minnesota, and in these two year* the Gov
ernment has lost 978,000,000, or 93.000.009 a
month.
CHANGES SUGGESTED.
Maxwell made the following recom
mendations:
Create immediately Into forest reserves every
acre of public forest lands more valuable for
timber than mining or agriculture; pass the
bill consolidating all Government forest work
in the Department of Agriculture, as re com- i
mended by the President; repeal the Umber ,
and stone act. as recommended by the Presl
dent, and thus stop gigantic timber steals; |
pass the Appalachian bill; plant trees on the
great plains; appropriate as much for forest !
planting as for forts and navies, and repeal ,
all tariff upon wood, lumber, pulp and forest
products.
Captain Beth Bullock, supervisor of
the Black Hills Forest Reserve, dis
cussed the question "Will the Admin
istration of the Forest Reserves on a
Conservative Basis Retard Mining?"
He pointed out "how in the successful
prosecution of the work required to
make a mine productive and remunera
tire to Its owners the use of forest tim- i
ber is an absolute necessity. It could
be truly said that a veritable forest
has been used under ground in the
mines of the Black Hills during the â¢
few years they have been in operation.
The committee on resolutions pre
sented its report to-day. It urges,
among ether things, full protection and
preservation of the forests; repeal of
the timber and stone act and the en
actment of a substitute authorizing
the proper Federal officers to sell tim
ber growing on public lands when the
sale shall be for the public welfare;
the planting and preservation of shade
trees along the public highways j
throughout America; increase of op- j
portunities for general forest education i
In educational institutions; immediate j
purchase of the Calaveras grove of big
trees by the National Government and
reconveyance of the Tosemlte Valley
to the National Government.

TO MEET WITH
THE PRESIDENT
Congressmen Invited to the
White House to Talk Over
Legislation for the Session
TO PROMOTE HARMONY
JSeonomy, Control of Trusts
and the Tariff Will Be
Discussed at Conference
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6.âPresident
Roosevelt has invited a number of Re
publican Senators and Representatives
to a conference at the White House for
to-morrow afternoon. It is understood
that the object is to consider the con
dition of the Treasury, the situation as
to appropriations and the necessity for
revenue legislation.
An effort will be made at the con
ference to harmonize differences, which
have arisen among the Republicans as
to the nature of the legislation to be
enacted at the present session, and to
secure, if possible, unanimity of action
regarding legislative action in the fu
ture. It is indicated that the confer
ence may take a wide scope.
An effort is being made in Congress
by Speaker Cannon and the members of
the Senate Committee on Appropria
tions to scale down all appropriations
to be passed at the present session.
This has aroused some antagonism
among Senators and Representatives,
who are Interested in appropriations
for river and harbor improvements, for
public buildings and for the extension
of the navy. It is expected that these
differences will be threshed out at the
conference to be held to-morrow.
It is suggested that legislation re
garding the proposed increase of the
powers of the Interstate Commerce
Commission, the tariff and the Federal
incorporation of companies doing an
interstate business will be considered.
It is known that the President Is in
terested in the subject of the tariff to
such an extent that he may call an ex
traordinary session of Congress for its
consideration. It is said to be quite
Improbable that a session earlier than
next fall will be called, and it is not
certain that one will be called for that
time. The President desires, however,
that action be taken by Congress, both
as to the tariff and as to the increase
of the powers of the Interstate Com
merce Commission, and he hopes this
action may be taken at a reasonably
early date. Members of Congress, who
are frequent callers at the White
House, have indicated that no action
on the tariff is likely to take place be
fore next fall.

MORE FOOD EXPERIMENTS
WITH THE POISON SQUAD
Effect of Preservatives, Coloring Mat
ter and Cold Storage Will
Be Studied.
WASHINGTON. Jan. 6.âThe so
called "poison squad." consisting of
clerks of the Department of Agricul
ture, who have volunteered for ser
vice in carrying out the food preserva
tive and coloring matter experiments
ot Chief Chemist Wiley, will reassem
ble next Monday and continue the ex
periments until March. The effects of
artificial coloring of food on the sys
tem will be studied. They will then
have a respite until the middle of
April, when the work will be resumed
until July L
While continuance of these expert- â 
roents beyond that date has not been
finally determined upon, it is prob
able that during next year a similar
squad will be utilized under the same
strict rules to carry on the experiments
as to cold storage food products. ,
These tests will have in view the de
termining of the exact effect of cold j
storage on foods and the rapidity of
the development of bacteria under
cold storage conditions.

BADEN PEOPLE
Say They Feel Earth Shake
When Railroad Laborers
Explode Tons of Dynamite
HILLS ARE BLOWN AWAY
Detonations Cause Residents
Much Inconvenience and
They Theorize on the Case
The residents of Baden, Ocean "View.
- Colma and adjoining towns are much
wrought up over the heavy blasting,
' that is being done by the Southern Pa- j
cine Company In the construction of its
new cut-off about five miles from Ba
% den. The citizens firmly believe that
the blasts are responsible for many of
.'â¢the numerous shake-ups felt recently.
â¢ For nearly two months blasts have i
been going off night and day at short
'. intervals. Some of them are small and
explode without annoying, while others
are as heavy as it is possible to make
them, and when they explode the clti- j
sens cf the adjoining districts say tho
.whole country for miles around quivers
.and quakes just like an earthquake.
The officials of the company and the j
contractors who are working on the j
' new road deny that the blasts are felt :
â¢in the vicinity. They admit that some j
heavy charges of dynamite have been;
â¢et off since the work began, but add ;
that the explosions were never felt and
' â¢ that it would be impossible for the
. shock to effect the district miles away.
The last heavy blast was set off on
Hew Year's day. Late in the afternoon
â¢ thirty tons of dynamite were exploded, I
and the entire side of a huge, rocky hill I
â¢ fully 300 feet long was blown away and
Its fragments were scattered far and
near. A saloon man In the vicinity says
his beer kegs were hurled from their
positions and his saloon was nearly
wracked. The people of Baden were
terrified when they felt the earth shak
ing.
Blasting has been going on steadily I
at two points along the old road that
leads froih Baden to South San Fran
cisco. The earth has been loosened all j
â¢along the line and two mammoth steam
' .shovels are at work clearing away the
â¢ rock and dirt that has become loosened
by the blasts. Work on the new tunnel
'. â¢ near South San Francisco will begin In
a few days, and it is probable that
some more heavy blasting will be done
; â¢ there.
' Strange to say, the residents who are \
â¢complaining about the blasts never;
hear a report when they feel the shook.
.Ail the reports have been smothered,
for the reason that the dynamite works
down and the rock and clay are loos
ened from beneath. The heaviest of j
' ', these blasts have torn away entire sec- j
.. tions of ground, while the work aceom
. plished by the light blasts is hardly no- :
/ â  ticeable.
The people who reside in Belmont and
â¢ . . other towns farther down say they
- ; riever experienced any shocks when the j
..Baden folks complained of quaking
I . earth.' Experts say the rock and clay
. . run in veins, and that Invariably the
' grain points north rather than south,
and for this reason the supposed shock
â¢â : would travel in the direction of the
grain.

HALT TO JURY
Several Indictments Found
in Eppinger Cases and
Attorney Is Overwhelmed
IMPOSE TOO MUCH WORK
Inquisitors Will Be Called
to Stand at Arraignment
of Chan Cheung To-Day
The Grand Jurors are blasting the
mountain of fraud in the Eppinger
grain cases, and if their present pur
poses are carried out there will be an
upheaval that will spread quakiness
far and wide. Witnesses who are al
leged to have committed perjury at the
trial of Jacob Eppinger some months
ago, in the effort to save him from
conviction, are particularly the aim of
the Grand Jury. Nor is any one im
plicated in the gigantic scheme of
fraudulent Issues of warehouse certifi
cates to be allowed to escape.
Several indictments were found in
the ca3e last night, but District Attor
ney Byington insisted on having sev
eral days to prepare the charges for
formal presentation. He complained
that the Grand Jury was about over
whelming him with its demands for
indictments.
Foreman Andrews was asked wheth
er Jacob Eppinger's sons were the sub
jects of inquiry, but he would neither
deny nor affirm. Nothing has been
done toward preferring charges against
Bernard Ettlinger, as has been erron
eously reported.
The Grand Jury will appear before
Judge Lawlor this morning with three
indictments in minor cases. Louis Ep
stein, a Mission street second-hand
dealer, will be accused of receiving
stolen property. According to the evi
dence submitted Epstein was in league
with a clerk in the store of the Pacific
Hardware and Steel company. The
latter stole from the stocks and Ep
stein sold the booty.
At 11 o'clock the Jurors will be called
as witnesses at the arraignment of
Chan Cheung before Judge Lawlor. The
attorneys for Chan will attempt to
show that In finding the indictment
against him for the murder of Tom
Tick the Jurors were actuated by un
just and forbidden motives. It will be
contended that the true bill for mur
der was returned against the Chinese
because he would not tell of the police
corruption fund in Chinatown, which
he Is believed to have handled. The
methods of "sweating" Chan, re
sorted to by the police committee of
the Grand Jury, are to have full air
ing, declare his counsel, and the Grand
Jurors expect a warm grilling on the
witness stand.
FORMER RUSSIAN OFFICER
MAKES SOME REVELATIONS
rells of Cmel ty and Method of Oast
tag the Innocent Into Exile
In Siberia.
"Political Banishment to Saghalien
Siberia," was the subject of a power
fully dramatic recitation of cruelty
brutality, cunning, fraud and false
hood presented before the members of
the British and American Union las
night by Lieutenant Colonel Alexand
er Lochwltzky, formerly of the Dra
goon Guards, one of Russia's crack
regiments.
The colonel told of how he, Ilk
many another, suffered degradatio
and exile because it was charged
without proof, without even inquiry o
giving him a chance to face the
charge, that he was a member of the
reform society. He declared that he
was asked to divulge the names ol
'his accomplices," and though he de
clared he had none and was not a
member of any such society his feet
were chained and with gangs of the
worst criminals, as well as many In
nocent persons, he was banished to
Siberia. The story of his escape waa
thrilling. Colonel Lochwitzky waa
heartily applauded throughout his
iecture.
Dr. Frederick W. d'Evelyn spoke on
'The Congo," and having a close ac
juaintance with that part of Africa
md its people was able to give a vivid
picture of cruelties practiced by the
jfficials of King Leopold.

PRETTY WOMAN
STILL IN JAIL
31 rs. Dorothy McCade's Case
Puzzles the Police, but
She Declares Innocence
HER 3IOTHER IS FOUND
Accused Woman Says She
Will Be Cleared of Charges
Brought Against Her
The ledger account of Mrs. Dorothy
McCade, whose penchant for offering
checks on banks in which she had over
drawn her credit, *is still puzzling the
police. Mrs. McCade, or McDade, as
she spells it on her trunks, has added
two additional debts to her column of
"I. O. U's," and the detectives are at a
loss to know whether the woman has
been acting in good faith or has run
the gamut of human weakness with
the idea of playing upon it.
The account at present stands:
DebtorâSeveral drafts on banks of
Southern California, a few unpaid ho
tel bills and a deal of explanation due.
CreditâSome good clothes, a woman's
ways, a somewhat pretty face
and a bankbook on a San Bernardino
bank that shows a balance due of
something over $300, but no punctured
slips to show what has been drawn
against it.
Technically Mrs. "McCade," as per
card, and Mrs. "McDade," as per
trunks, is not a criminal. She has not
done anything that makes her-answer
able to the law unless the charge be
that of obtaining goods under false
pretenses. Her bankbook is with the
Farmers' Bank of San Bernardino and
that institution reports that the
woman's husband, or a man represent
ing himself as such, had deposited an
amount against which she was sup
posed to draw. However, on a recent
date the sum was withdrawn by the
man, and it is possible that the woman
did not know this.
Mrs. McCade, however, has led a
mysterious life. When she registered
at the St. Francis Hotel she did so at a
time when the Maxine Elliott Company
had signed its names to the register.
This inspired the idea of becoming an
actress, and upon the theory that the
stage would afford her a remunerative
living It Is supposed that Mrs. McCade
acted.
When Mrs. McCade registered at the
St. Francis there was stopping at the
hotel one J. B. Rice, who is a promi
nent traveling man and a representa
tive of an Eastern powder company.
Mr. Rice and Mrs. McCade were good
friends and he would perhaps be able
to tell much of the young woman's life
if he were here, but he has left town.
The police yesterday learned that
checks signed in the writing of Mrs.
McCade In favor of the firm of Wein
stock & Lubin and the Emporium Com
pany had been cashed. They were given
in exchange for goods some days ago
and drawn on a San Bernardino bank.
When questioned, Mrs. McCade denied
having issued any checks other than
that payable to R. D. Davis & Co.
Yesterday she was visited several times
by a young man named Farren, who
claims to be acting as her attorney
and who knew the woman in Southern
California.
Mrs. McCade was a Miss Dorothy Al
bright. Her mother lives at Fenner,
Cal., and she has a sister-in-law, a
Mrs. Ida McCade, who has been living
at the Hotel Eugene on O'Farrell street
in this city. A. L. *Shinn, an attorney
of Los Angeles, is acquainted with Mrs.
McCade. The woman sent him a pres
ent of a pretty piece of silverware, but
for some reason best known to him
self the lawyer returned the gift. She
was also a friend of Henry Overhalt of
Los Angeles and appears to have been
known widely among men of promi
nence In* Southern California.
"I will be cleared of this," said Mrs.
McCade yesterday afternoon. "I am not
criminally liable for the checks I have
Issued, as they were tendered in good
faith. All will be settled and I will be
cleared of these silly charges."
No charge has been entered against
Mrs. McCade and it is thought that she
will be released from custody to-day
unless some one shows a disposition to
prosecute. The check she offered the
St. Francis Hotel was not in payment
of her bill, but merely for collection.
TRIAL OF CHARLES WYMAN
MAKES LITTLE PROGRESS
District Attorney Expects to Finish
Offering Testimony for Prosecu
tion at Next Session.
Those who attended the Wyman
trial yesterday in expectation of a sen
sation were disappointed. Nearly the
entire morning: was taken up by the
reading of *the primary election notice
offered as evidence by the defense.
In the afternoon Registrar Adams was
called to the stand to verify the pro
ceedings of the election. Attorney
Countryman fought every scrap of evi
dence ofTered.
At one time the accused ballot-box
stuffer's attorney strayed from the
track to an address on the privilege of
cross-questioning. The affidavit of
registration, signed by Wyman, was
verified by Deputy Registrar J. X.
Strand and was entered as an exemp
lar of the accused's handwriting. Fair
fax Wheelan was present in the court
room in the afternoon. The trial will
be resumed at 9:30 o'clock on Mon
day morning. At that time, District
Attorney Byington says, the testimony
for the prosecution will be completed.

SURGEON'S COOL SKILL
SAVES CHILD'S LIFE
Dr. E. W. Stevens of the Harbor Hos
pital Performs a Daring and
Successful Operation.
The carelessness of a druggist in the
Popular Drug Store at Broadway and
Dupont street yesterday Jeopardized
the life of little Wong You, who lives
at 629 Pacific street, and the Chinese
child's life was saved only by a dar
ing and unusual operation performed
by Harbor Hospital Surgeon W. E.
Stevens, assisted by Dr. Glover.
Wong You, the son of Wong Look,
who conducts a restaurant at 642
Jackson street, was taken by his
mother to the drug store. She asked
the attendant for a dose of castor oil
fcr the child and received a quantity
of carbolic acid.
Little suspecting the mistake the
child gurped down the flecy liquid and
fell writhing to the floor in convul
sions. An ambulance soon arrived and
little Wong You was taken to the
Harbor Hospital. There Dr. Stevens
discovered that the trachea and wind
pipe had become congested and closed,
so that the child was choking to
death.
The surgeon resolved upon heroic
measures. With the aid of Dr. Glover
the patient was placed on the table,
the sufferer's throat and trachea were
slit open with a keen knife and a sil
ver tube was inserted. An antidote to
the poison was administered and the
child was able to breathe and will live.

Cross-Complaint Are Dismissed
in Court. Â»
The divorce suit of Lillian P. Week
against John R. Week, a tailor, in
which he was charged with cruelty,
was dismissed in Judge Seawell's court
yesterday, indicating a reconciliation.
She based her accusations on his habit
of staying out until after midnight and
the fact hat. he once struck her in the
face. He filed a cross-complaint de
claring that she was cruel to him in
that she sent their baby to live with
relatives because it was troublesome.

SUNSET DISTRICT LEADS IN
THE VAN OF IMPROVEMENTS
Many Streets Opened and Inducements
Offered to Seekers of Homesteads
for Permanent Residence.
According to Secretary Edward
Ewald of the Sunset District Improve
ment Club, as shown by his report,
just compiled, the valley that a few
years ago was covered with sand is
now an ideal place for homes. Streets
and avenues have been opened all the
way from First avenue on the east to
Ninetenth avenue on the west and
from H street on the north to M street
on the south. Thousands of tons of
sand have been carted off this space and
streets and avenues laid out, paved
and sewered, ready for building.
It is the intention of the residents
of this district to have Nineteenth ave
nue graded and paved from H street
to its junction with Dewey boulevard.
The connection with Ocean avenue and
Ingleside roadway will make a pic
turesque driveway from the Presidio,
leading through Golden Gate Park out
and into SanfMateo County.
By the co-operation of the City Sur
veyor and at the expense of the prop-
erty-owners a system of sewerage has
been established, which drains the en
tire section into one mammoth sewer at
Fifteenth avenue. This runs through
Golden Gate Park, connecting with the
big sewer at D and Fulton streets, on
the north of Uie park, where It is car
ried into the bay on the north side
of Richmond.
Other less offensive refuse is car
ried into a septic tank within Golden
Gate Park where it is used as a fer
tilizer for portions of the grounds yet
needing soil.
Clerfayt is Knighted.
Jules Clerfayt, general Western
agent of the International Sleeping
Car Company and the Trans-Siberian
Railway, has been advised of the feet
that in consideration of his services in
piloting visiting Persians through this
country, he has been made a knight
of "The Lion of the Sun." This mark
of distinction cost the young transpor
tation agent considerable trouble and
annoyance recently while he was
guiding one of Persia's distinguished
but bankrupt noblemen across the
country. The latter frequently called
on Clerfayt to meet his Highness' bills
on promises to settle with him when
he returned to Persia. It is believed
that the knighthood is one means the
nobleman has resorted to to quiet
Clerfayt's claims for remuneration.
PAUL RUBENS'
LATEST PLAY
"Lady Madcap,". Exploiting
Pranks of Peer's Daughter,
an Attractive Stage Piece
LONDON, Jan. â"Lady Madcap,"
the new musical piece by Paul Rubens
and Newnham Davis, which George
Edwardes produced last Saturday
night, has been waited for with un
usual Interest. Paul Rubens, who sup
plies the music and some of the words
of the new play, is the author of
"Three Little Maids," and in his latest
effort several of the company who
played In the "Little Maids" in the
United States, and more recently In
Australia, make their reappearance.
Chief of these is G. P. Huntley, whose
acting as a silly swell has made a
big hit.
Curiosity was rife to see whether
these players had been supplied with
another vehicle worthy of their tal
ents.
Although Paul Rubens has not writ
ten another "Three "Little Maids," the
play which he and Newnham Davis
have put together is an attractive one
as It stands, and promises to be an un
commonly attractive one by the time
it Is presented to American audiences.
Newnham Davis is a retired lieutenant
colonel In the army, who has written
amusingly for several years about
gastronomic matters the world over,
and who now makes his first appear
ance as a librettist.
IN LOVE WITH SOLDIER.
"Lady Madcap" is all about the pranks
of Betty, a peer's pretty daughter. She
has fallen in love with a young soldier
named Smith, as the result of having
seen him make a "century" at cricket.
Hearing that his regiment is stationed
close by, she invites the whole outfit
to her father's country seat, Egbert
Castle. Now, Lord Framlingham de
tests soldiers, so Lady Betty sends him
a telegram, purporting to come from
the Foreign Office, as the result of
which he posts off to London, taking
with him his highly severe butler.
When the soldiers arrive, however,
Lady Betty discovers that her hero,
Smith, is only a private, and therefore
unable to meet her on equal terms. As
a matter of fact, he is Auroya Brown,
a young millionaire, who is doing a
short tour of soldiering for the fun of
it. But his pretty hostess, knowing
nothing of this, urges him to gain ac
cess to the drawing-room by taking the
place of the absent butler. Smith
agrees, and in order to keep him in
countenance Lady Betty masquerades
as a lady's maid, first persuading her
girl churn, Gwenny Holden, to pass
herself off as the daughter of the house.
Of course, all sorts of complications
arise immediately. The amateur but
ler gets himself into hot water by un
due familiarity with the guests, while
Lady Betty's chum in her assumed
character of a peer's daughter is over
whelmed with attentions, notably from
a French Count (Maurice Farkoa),
who is among the company.
TRIUMPH OF CUPID.
Finally, it having leaked out that the
real hostess is disguised as a lady's
maid, every pretty domestic in the
place is courted in turn in the hope
that she may be Lady Betty.
The end comes when Lord Farmllng
ham returns and bursts in wrathfully
on the merry scene. He is placated,
however, upon discovering that the
young man whom he sees in butler's
dress is a millionaire who has proposed
marriage to his daughter, and all ends
happily.
G. P. Huntley is the make-believe
butler, and when he has worked up his
part more will be quite as amusing as
he was in "Three Little Maids." Madge
Crichton is not in the cast, the part of
Lady Betty being taken by Adrienne
Augarde, another of George Edwardes'
finds and a most winning young wom
an. Delia Mason plays the part .of
Gwenny Holden, Lady Betty's chum,
while George Carroll is a diminutive
corporal.
At present there are not as many good
songs in "Lady Madcap" as there were
in "Three Little Maids," but that is a
matter that can be easily remedied.
Maurice Farkoa, however, has a ditty
called "I Like You in Satin; I Love You
in PluEh," that is sure to be liked on
both sides of the water.
HOLIDAY SPECTACLE.
If holiday plays for children were as
popular in the United States as they
are in this country Arthur Bourchier's
Christmas offering for the young folk
would be sure cf an American produc
tion, for it is all about the famous lit
tle characters in the "Dumpy Books."
Rutland Barrington, the former "Pooh
Bah" of the Savoy company, who
dramatized Kingsley's "Water Babies"
so successfully a year ago, is the au
thor of the new piece. It is called
"Little Black Sambo and Little White
Barbara," and they, not to mention the
two aunts, Dr. Funnyman, Plantagenet.
Black Jumbo and the "tigers." are all
in it as large as life. With tuneful mu
sic, it makes an attractive entertain
ment, which is played by a capable
company, Including Frank Lawton, thÂ«Â»
American whistler of "The Belle of
New York."
DR. DAVID STARR JORDAN
WILL SPEAK AT TRINITY.
"Marriage. Its Sacredness and Duties,**
and "Evils of Divorce" to

Stanford University; the Rev. D.

SWINDLER USES
FORGED CHECKS
Berkeley Merchants Victim
ized by Man Who Uses
Name of Charles F. Cole
FLOOD OF BOGUS PAPER
Â».
Clumsy Counterfeit Accepted
. From Schemer, Who Gets
Good Coin in Exchange
a
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
' . 2148 Center Street, Jan. 6.
A flood of forged checks, passed upon
merchants ot Berkeley during the last
few days, came to the attention of the
police to-day when four of the victims
related their tales of woe, and showed
in evidence the bits of worthless pa
per which they took in exchange for
coin. All the forged checks were on
the University Bank and were drawn
â¢ to the orVer of " J. Woerdt."
The name of C. F. Cole, agent for the
Spring Construction Company in this
.part of the country, was signed to
the '-hecks. The company has an ac
count at the University Bank, of which
account Cole is made agent. The per
son perpetrating the forgeries evident
ly was familiar with this fact, but neg
' letted to make his checks out in the
manner adopted by <'ole, who Is wont
to issue a c heck signed by "The Spring
Construction Company, per C. F. Cole."
John Sweetman, proprietor of the
Chicago Hotel at West Berkeley, was
â¢ one of the victims. He accepted a
. check from a stranger, who had bought
\. a few drinks at the bar of his hotel,
â¢ and in other ways had made himself
known as a "good fellow." The strang
. er's expenditures were not large, but
they gave him a certain standing and
'. when he asked that his "pay check" be
cashed, Sweetman obligingly favored
him with $25, a part of which immedi
â¢ ately was spent over the counter. When
' the check came to Cashier Mills at the
: University Bank of Berkeley he
promptly declared that the name at the
â¢, ' bottom did not represent any account
in the University Bank.
Fred Munday, proprietor of the Roy
al Arch saloon at San Pablo and Uni
. versity avenues, was the second vlc
. ' Tim of the check passer to make his
trouble known. He received one of the
documents which "J. Woerdt" so
thoughtfully distributed in West
. Berkeley. The amount inscribed on the
bit of paper was identical with that
which Mr. Sweetman paid, and the
. â¢ check met a similar fate when it came
â¢ - to the bank for payment. James
Grady, bartender, cashed the check at
Munday's place for "Woerdt." He will
â¢.'have to stand the loss.
The police expect to hear from other
. merchants of Berkeley who have been
victimized by the smooth stranger who
â¢ picked up the money so easily in West
Berkeley. They declare that it is usu
ally the plan for swindlers of this sort
â â¢to cut a wider swath than four bogus
checks would represent. Inquiry is
.being made among merchants for
."traces of the swindler.
John Sweetman, one of the victims,
said: "The man who got the money
from me represented himself as a la
borer, who had money coming to him
from the quarry people near here. His
. checks were made out in regular fash
ion. They looked like pay checks. I
had no hesitation in cashing them,
. though I had only known Woerdt, as
.he called himself, a few days."
Fred Munday tells a similar story.
A third victim of the forger appeared
at the West Berkeley Bank this after
noon, in the person of a saloon-keeper,
whose place of business is at Ninth
street and San Pablo avenue. His
â  name was not given out at the bank,
but he is reported to have lost $5
through the check passer's operations.
Charles F. Cole, agent for the Spring
Construction Company, resides at 2417
Bancroft way. He said to-night: "I
..have been Informed that my name has
been forged to at least four checks that
have been accepted by merchants of
Berkeley. I have no idea who has done
the work. Woerdt is unknown to me.
I hope the swindler will be caught and
punished."

CHURCH CLOSES FIRST
HALF CENTURY.
EXERCISES AT ST. JOHN'S
OAKLAND, Jan. Â«.âThe celebration
of the fiftieth anniversary of the or
ganization of St. John's Episcopal
Church of Oakland began this morning
with a parochial communion of the
members of the parish. The Rev. Ed
gar F. Gee, rector, conducted the ser
vice and afterward addressed the con
gregation. Many of those baptised or
confirmed at St. John's Church during
the half-century of its work, who have
since moved away from the parish, at
tended the service this*morning, once
more meeting old friends.
The first of the regular jubilee ser
vices was held this evening, being a
union meeting of all the Episcopal par
ishes of Alameda County, with all the
rectors of these parishes participating.
The Right Rev. William Ford Nichols,
Bishop of the diocese, preached the
opening jubilee sermon, in which he
told of the great work of Dr. Benja
min Akerly, founder of St John's,
during the forty years of his rector
ship.
After the reading of the lesson by the
Rev. C. T. Walkley, rector of St. Paul's,
the Rev. Edgar F. Gee welcomed the
clergymen and laity to the church.
After announcing the time of the vari
ous Jubilee services the rector said:
To this our golden Jubilee celebration I bid
ycu welcome. Especially do I extend a hearty
welcome to the people who after a long ab
sence from the parish have come once more to
the old home. For this Is home, fthe first home o
our church In Alameda County. St. Haul s
Church, the Church oUÂ« Advent in East Oak
land. St. Andrew s, Trinity and all the other
Kpit.copal churches in Alarieda County are the
children of St. John"s, and in the same sense
Â«re the result of the great work of Dr. Akerly,
the beloved founder and father of our parish.
The address of the rector was fol
lowed by the opening anniversary ad
dress of Bishop Nichols, who took as
his text, "Let your light so shine be
fore men that they may see your good
works, and glorify your Father which
is in heaven." After speaking at some
length of the history of St. John's
Church and parish in the work of the
diocese, Bishop Nichols said:
In the course of these golden jubilee services
you are to have a historical address on the
great work of St. Paul s parish during its fifty
years, and you will hear a part of what may
be told of the life of Dr. Akerly, its founder.
But it seems to me that to-night I may take
that life, which for four-fifths of the life of
this parish was devoted to Its welfare, and
the. welfare of Its people, as an example of
my text.
Benjamin Akerly waÂ» a pioneer, and, as
your rector has said, he waa expansive. Dr.
Akerly believed that one of the best ways to
insure the growth and prosperity of this par
ish was to build up others around it, and to
day we see the result of his work in the other
churches of Alameda County. But his work
was not easy. Dr. Akerly was a pioneer, and
be met the same difficulties'as confront others
engaged in pioneer work, But with the true
pioneer spirit he conquered these difficulties
and layed the foundations on which we have
since built
Holy communion will be celebrated
to-morrow morning at 7:30 o'clock in
memory of departed members of the
parish. On Sunday elaborate services
will be held.

Housewife Plays Detective and Gets
Clew That Neighbor Had Bagged
Many Domestic Articles.
OAKLAND, Jan. 6.âFriends as well
as neighbors were Mrs. P. Walcott and
Mrs. Mary Palmer, occupying flats at
1402 Thirteenth street, until Mrs. Wal
cctt missed a quantity of her house
hold effects and suspected her upstairs
neighbor of knowing something about
the disappearance.
Sheets, pillows, towels, table cloths,
aprons and underskirts do not take
wings of themselves and fly away,
conned Mrs. Walcott. There had been
no burglar a-prowling around at night
to the housewife's knowledge. She
did a bit of Sherlock Holmesing. The
result was an application for a search
warrant upon an affidavit that Mrs.
Palmer had made way with the stuff.
Detectives searched the Palmer flat
and recovered much domestic para
phernalia. In the Police Court to-day
Mrs. Walcott identified half a dozen
sheets, a dozen pillow cases, a dozen
tea doylies, a dosen hand towels, a
table cloth, two dozen napkins, one
gold charm, two aprons and one flan
nel underskirt.
Mrs. Palmer made no resistance, nor
did she appear to question the owner
ship of the goods.

for Five Days.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 6.âWhen Letter
Carrier Alfred R. H. Wolff, suspended
for five days for refusing to return to
a postal inspector charges that had
been preferred against him, attempted
to enter the employes' door of the
postoffice to-day he was confronted by
Policeman Edward McDonnell and or
dered to stay out or lay himself liable
to arrest. Wolff was accused some
weeks ago of using abusive and dis
respectful language to persons on the
route where he carried mail and
charges were lodged against him. He
was served with a copy of the same by
a postal inspector and when the lat
ter demanded the return of the docu
ment yesterday Wolff refused; to com
ply. Postmaster T. W. Leydecker was
then ordered to suspend Wolff for five
days for Insubordination. It was his
effort to go to work despite the order
of suspension that resulted in Wolffs
meeting with a policeman.

ANOTHER WIDOW
IS VICTIMIZED
Portland Woman Deserted by
"Doc" Proctor on Eve of
Wedding Day Is Accuser
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 6.
Another widow, this time from Ore
gon, has arisen to accuse "Doctor"
William Proctor, now in the County
Jail, accused of Inveigling aged and
confiding widows to loan him money
upon the prospect of his accompanying
them to Hymen's altar. Her name is
Sarah Clark and she writes from Port
land, Ore. The story is the same as
told by the others, although the
amount obtained by Proctor is not
stated. She says that nothing was too
small for him to steal and that he
went off with a bolt of silk out of
which a wedding gown was to have
been made.
Mrs. Clark writes that she is glad to
know where Proctor is so that she can
write to him and tell him what she
thinks of him, with a warning that if
they ever meet she will make the
meeting memorable. She refers in a
jocular way to the marriage license
she bought and tells how Proctor left
town on a night train on the eve of
their wedding day. She mourns still
the loss of the contents of her purse
and the silk, which she had kept as a
treasure.
Proctor and Roy Ashberry, his step
son and alleged confederate, were,
taken to Centerville to-day for the
continuation of the preliminary hear
ing on the charge of stealing diamond
rings from aged Mrs. Tyson of Nlles.
Owing to the absence of thoir attorney,
Tom Bradley, however, the case was
postponed until next Tuesday.
YOUNG WEBER'S COUNSEL
ATTACKS INDICTMENT
Demurs to True Bill Charging Rob
bery Returned by the Grand Â»
Jury.
AUBURN, Jan. 6.âThe case of
Adolph Weber, charged with robbing
the Placer County Bank, came up on
demurrer before Judge Prewett tc-day.
Attorney Tabor, in his demurrer, at
tacked the indictment on the ground
that it did not charge that the money
of which the bank waa robbed was tak
erf from the person of Bookkeeper Ed
ward McPadyen or froni his immediate
presence, but that it simply stated the
money was taken from his possession.
He argued that to constitute robbery
the money must have been taken from
the person, otherwise it would be grand
larceny.
The demurrer was taken under ad
visement by the court.
WANT BILLOTS
TO BE SECRET
Socialists Would Enjoin the
Calling of Primary Elec
tion Under the Present Law
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 6.
In order to prepare the way for per
sons to vote the Socialist ticket at the
primary election to be held the latter
part of this month without being
obliged to indicate their party affilia
tion, arguments were made before
Judge Henry Melvin this afternoon for
an injunction restraining, the City
Council from calling an election under
the present primary law upon the
ground that it is unconstitutional.
The action is begun by M. Lesser,
who was a Socialist candidate for Con
gress at the last election, and he was
represented by Attorneys Lewis and
Royce, who hold that the present law
is unconstitutional upon three grounds
âfirst, because it is not secret; second,
because it discriminates between cit
izens in that one having been a dele
gate to one convention cannot sign a
petition for another; third, because it
Interferes with the rights of citizens
to associate together as. political par
ties and instruct delegates. City At
torney McElroy argued for the city.
The arguments took a wide range and
bear upon the point that by rea
son of the fact that the ballot is not
secret many persons are deterred from
voting the Socialist ticket on the
ground that small political parties are
looked on with ill favor.
Judge Melvin took the case under
advisement.
Insurance Not for Creditors.
HONOLULU, Dec. 28.âJudge Rob
inson of the Circuit Court has decided
in the case of the estate of the late
A. R. Scrimgeour, that insurance for
$3000 payable to his heirs cannot be
tajien by the creditors of his estate
and the money therefore goes to his
nephews, resident in California, Allan
R. and Harold A, Scrimgeour.

Auzerais' Name Again Ap
pears on Record of Courts
in Suit to Sever the Ties
RECALLS HOT CONTEST
Man of Pioneer Connections
Made Defendant in a Com
plaint Alleging Desertion
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 6.
Eva E. Auzerais has sued Raoul Auze
rais In San Francisco for a divorce,
alleging desertion. The couple have
been separated for two years. Auzerais
is a member of the pioneer San Jose
family of that name, and a brother to
Louis Auxerais, whose domestic affairs
were involved in sensational litigation
in the Alameda County courts. Louis
Auzerais had been divorced from his
wife, who was the daughter of Llew
ellyn Williams, a prominent capitalist
of Sacramento. She had been married
several times. By Auzerais there was
a son, John Llewellyn Auzerais, who
was the subject of a battle for guard
ianship.
The boy by his mother's will was
left a fortune of $150,000. Esmoil, the
stepfather; Mrs. Auzerais of San Jose,
his grandmother, and C. W. Clark,
trustee of the boy's estate, made a
three-cornered fight to be named guard
ian. Esmoil won. The boy's father had
remarried and was in Paris. He took
no part in the contest.
Raoul Auzerais left San Francisco
two years ago and is supposed to be
in Chicago. His wife resides in San
Francisco.
Thomas J. Mitchell has begun a suit
for divorce from Anna M. Mitchell,
whom he accuses of cruelty and de
sertion. Besides being a scold he says
that once when she got the house
painted she told him it cost $200 when
in reality it only cost $125 and she pock
eted the difference.
The following interlocutory decrees
were granted to-day: Frances
Braendli from Henry Braendli for de
sertion; Mary A. Russell from John
Russell for extreme cruelty; Emma
Matheson from Joseph Matheson for
extreme cruelty; Anna P. Miguel from
John P. Miguel for extreme cruelty;
Hulda Smyth from Robert J. Smyth
for desertion.
NOT TO REPEAT
QUEER BLUNDER
Survey Ordered of University
Campus to Make Impos
sible Repetition of Error
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Jan. 6.
Under the direction of John Galen
Howard, professor of architecture at
the State University, surveyors to-day
began the work of making an accurate
and comprehensive survey of the entire
university campus, the result of which
is expected to be a prevention of any
errors in the making of plans for struc
tures thereon, such, for example, as
was made when the plans for the min
ing building were carried out.
At that time if Architect Benard's
ideas had been carried out the mining
building would have been left with one
corner about forty feet up in the air.
This was due to the failure to supply
the famous French architect with just
such a map or survey as is now being
made. A glance at the mining building
as it now stands, uncompleted, is said
by architects to reveal the original mis
conception of the ground elevation by
the architect who made the plans for
the building.
John Galen Howard Is to be supplied
with a map so fine and complete that
the height of every tree on the campus
will be revealed. The map will show
the elevation of every hillock, and it
will also have a table of comparative
distances, by the aid of which plans for
any of the structures to be built event
ually for the "greater university" can
be drawn hereafter without the possi
bility of an error at any stage of the
proceedings.
Architect Howard has almost finished
the drawings for the new university
library, to cost $600,000, and very soon
work on that magnificent structure is
to be begun. When completed it will
be the best equipped library in the
country. Wisconsin University now has
the largest library building, with most
modern equipment, but the palm is
eventually to be California's when all
the plans now in abeyance are carried
out. It is expected to be sufficient for
the university's needs, according to the
authorities, for seventy-five years to
come.

CHICO, Jan. 6.âResidents of Chero

ience from the raids of coyotes and
wildcats. The animals attack chicken
and turkey roosts. At times in broad
daylight they appear in large numbers
in the very town. So troublesome have
they become that the residents are con

ACCEPTS BAY
CITIES' PLAN
Council Makes Move Toward
Calling a Municipal Wa
ter Supply Bond Election
â¢
TO BE HELD IN MARCH
Contra Costa's Condemna
tion Offer Referred Back
Without Recommendation
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway. Jan. 6.
The Bay Cities Water Company's
proposal to Install a municipal water
supply of 20,000,000 gallons daily "ca
pacity for $0,750,000 was accepted to
night by the City Council in commit
tee of the whole. City Attorney Mc-
Elroy was instructed to draw the
necessary resolution for presenta
tion to the City Council Monday night.
The Contra Costa Water Company's
offer to submit to a condemnation suit
to determine the value of its plant was
referred to the City Council without
recommendation.
The Bay Cities' project as definitely
submitted to-night recites the com
pany's readiness to enter Into the
necessary contract with the city as
soon as the bond election shall be held
to authorize the city to proceed.
In its tender the corporation declares
it will furnish a sufficient bond of
$1,000,000 to protect the interests of the
city under the contract. It purposes
to provide the proposed system of wa
ter works, including all necessary
rights, lands, properties and ease
ments, to make all Improvements and
to convey the completed plant to the
city free of all incumbrance.
The company agrees specifically to
meet the following conditions:
To maintain the city's rights to take
and use the storm waters of Isabel
Creek and the Arroyo del Valle; to
maintain the city's right to the peace
able possession and use of all the prop
erties, rights and easements included In
the water works system; to complete
the specified, or other agreed improve
ments upon the properties, in a sub
stantial and workmanlike manner; to
deliver the water works system to the
city free and clear of all incumbrance.
The company requires that a reso
lution accepting the offer shall be
adopted within ten days, and that with
in twenty-flve days thereafter a bond
election shall be called. If the bonds
carry, the company stipulates that the
contract must be signed by March 31.
Accompanying the proposal was an in
vitation to each member of the Coun
cil to make a thorough investigation of
all the data in the company's posses
sion.
Dates were submitted showing that
the election can be called between
March 1 and 13.
Attorney R. M. Fitzgerald, in reply to
Councilman Howard's questions, said
he would on Monday night furnish the
City Council with a statement concern
ing the company's position in the mat
ter of title to the watershed. HowaN
said he thought the company should be
willing to pay the cost of the bond elec
tion in the event the titles are not ac
ceptable to the city.
The Spring Valley Water Works gave
notice it would attack the right of the
Bay Cities to Isabel Creek waters. At
torney Fitzgerald replied that the com
pany fully expected and was pre
pared to meet that litigation. He de
clared the bond of $1,000,000 was by no
means the extent of the corporation's
resources, and that it was fully sup
plied with the means to give the city
what it had offered to supply.

FIST FIGHT IN ROOMS
OF MAYOR OF PORTLAND
Ex-City Official and Indicted Contrac
tor Come to Blows After Ex.
cntlve Board's Meeting.
PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. 6.â"You're a
robber," cried E. W. Riner in Mayor
Williams' office this afternoon. He
spoke to J. M. Long, ex-City Attorney,
who a moment before had represented
the Oregon Savings Bank before the
meeting of the executive board in the
room adjoining. And then and there
occurred a fierce fist fight, for Riner
struck Long a tremendous blow, which
knocked the lawyer nearly across the
room.
Fire Chief Campbell and members of
the august executive board rushed into
the Mayor's office and separated the
combatants, who lunged repeatedly at
each other while in the peacemakers'
arms.
Riner and his father were the con
tractors on the notorious Tanner Creek
sewer. The bank represented by Long
financed the contract. The Riners haV e
since been indicted by the county
Grand Jury.

Placing Liberal Orders
NEW YORK, Jan. 6.âDun's weekly
â¢review of trade to-morrow will say:
. '*â  Aside from some hesitation at the
' South, owing to the recent fall in the
price of cotton, business conditions are
lavorable and optimistic sentiments are
cxidenced by extensive preparations
. â¢; active trade. As annual reports
. appear it is found that the closing
;. n onths of 1904 made a much better ex
hibit than the first half, which started
new year with smaller stocks of
'g ii ds in the hands of dealers, assuring
era! contracts in the near future fur
iÂ» plenishment of supplies. A few minor
labor controversies have arisen, but the
: Kail River mills are more active, and in
moat branches of manufacture there is
; a*;steady decrease in the proportion of
, idle machinery, one prominent producer
of woolen goods reporting 95 per cent
oÂ°f all plants in operation. Gross earn
; rugs of the railroads In December were
6.4 per cent larger than in the same
month of 1903. Winter wheat conditions
have improved, and the partial recov
ery in cotton prices may prevent the
â  threatened curtailment. Buyers are ar
riving in the leading markets, and in
another week liberal orders for spring
flClivery will be placed. Dispatches
from other cities are generally encour
. aging. As inventories and repairs are
completed the various departments of
the iron and steel industry steadily ex
fend operations, and the sentiment is
'in striking contrast to the conserva
tism that prevailed a year ago.
â¢ -Failures for the week number 210 in

year's trade engross wholesalers and
-jobbers. Cold weather, however, makes
for a fair retail trade in winter goods.
â¢.The generally small stocks of winter
goods in final distributors' hands are
reported less than usual. This fact,
coupled with the knowledge that the
coming three and six months' business
will compare with a reduced volume a
year ago, leads to the belief that com

TELLS THE TRUTH AND
SAVES HIS POSITION
Commissioners Lenient With Honest
: : Fireman Who Had Flagrantly
Violated the Rules.
. ' Because Thomas G. Ward of Truck
Kc. 3" frankly admitted he entered a
: saloon on Christmas day for the pur
â¢ ppse of getting a drink of whisky and
Jhere participated in a fight while
dressed In his uniform the Fire Com- â 
rhjssioners yesterday let him off with
suspension for thirty days instead of
'dismissal.
' ''It is so rare that an accused fire- !
man tells us the truth that I think this
board ought to show you some mark
of appreciation," declared Commis
sioner Parry. Commissioners Boyne I
"and Barrett acquiesced. One of Ward's
. ai ms was broken in his combat and he
wuuld n.ot be able to perform his j
duties within a month's time anyhow.
â¢ JE. L. Raffestein, hoseman, Engine
' 17, pleaded guilty to absenting
himself from his post too long during j
' dinner hour. He said he had ,
"neglected to watch the clock. His ser
; vice in the department has been long
and highly honorable and a reprimand
â¢from the Chief was deemed sufficient \
for his case.
Chief Sullivan's recommendation
that the names of August Engelke and !
Vlaude Brownell be inscribed in the I
.'foH of honor of the department was |
Adopted. The firemen were recipients
â¢ot- the Scannell medal for acts of valor, j
'.The Chief reported the following
" suspensions for violations of the rules: j
'.John O'Donnell, truckman, Truck No. j
: 9.. January 3; N. Roebling, probation-]
â¢e'ry â hoseman, Engine No. 12, Jan- j
'u'iÂ»fy 1.
.'â¢The plans and specifications for a
hew engine-house on Twenty-sixth
a venue, in the Richmond District, as
prepared by the Board of Public
Works, were accepted. The building is
to cost $10,000.
A < ommunication was received from
residents of the Reis tract, Visitacion
Valley and the adjoining territory
asking the board for &00 feet of hose
and the necessary appurtenances. A
.volunteer fire company will be organ
ized and water with good pressure is
available from a reservoir.' Chief Sul
livan said the community is growng
rapidly and should have some fire pro
tection. He was instructed to comply
v ith the request.

LINER ACAPULCO IS ATTACKED BY A WHALE
w
Big Fish Charges on Steamship, but an Upper
Cut From Propeller Makes Leviathan Quit.
PACIFIC MAIL COMPANY*? LINER CHINA, WHICH WILL SAIL. TUESDAY FOR THE ORIENT, CARRYING A LARGE
CARGO FOR FAR EASTERN POBTS AND TAKING FOR THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT A SHIPMENT OF GOLD
BULLION VALUED AT $2,500,000.
The Pacific Mall Company's Ilii*r
Acapulco, which arrived early yester
day morning- from Panama and way
ports, had an exciting experience with
a whale off San Bias. The leviathan,
floating high out of the water, was en
joying a morning nap and giving its
tough hide a sun bath when the Aca
pulco came along. The lookout sighted
the whale and called the attention of
the man at the wheel to the slumbering
mountain of flesh that floated directly
in the liner's path. The quartermaster,
who was steering, gave the spokes of
the wheel a twist and the Acapulco's
head sheered off a little. A collision
was avoided, but the Acapulco's side
grazed the starboard shoulder of the
big fish and jarred the whale from
slumberland.
The whale was fully awake before the
liner had entirely passed. He awoke in
a bad temper and made a furious rush
at the Acapulco's stern. The whale
found the disturber of his dreams a
pretty solid sort of flsh, but, undaunt
ed by his failure to ram his head
through the steel plates, gathered him
self for another charge. He struck the
steamer under the stern, and as he
bounced off slashed at the retreating
hull with his tail. Then one more rush.
This time the whale found his match,
for the rapidly revolving propeller
landed a bewildering succession of up
percuts on his lower jaw. With a splash
of defiance the leviathan dived and dis
appeared and the people of the Aca
pulco saw him no more. Chief Officer
Bailey interviewed the quartermaster,
who had avoided the whale by such a
narrow margin, and concluded a heart
to-heart sailor talk by advising the
steersman in future to "let sleeping
whales He."
The new lighthouse at Cape San Lu
cas was in commission, although not
quite finished, when the Acapulco
passed. The light was burning and
Captain Brown reports very favorably
on the new beacon, .which for many
years has been wanted by mariners.
The Acapulco brought 980 tons of car
go and treasure valued at $2300. She
brought forty-one passengers, among
whom were the following:
John Metly, E. H. Moffett. J. Davis, H.
Beckett. Lam Chin, O. L. Dyson, I, W. Han
â¢on. Marguerite Davie, Madeline Holland, M.
I. Wonderlick. H. N. Butler. George Park
hurst. G. Davis. Roy Holland. Beatrice Won

Will Carry Much Gold.
In addition to a large cargo the Pacific
Mail Company's liner China, which sails on
Tuesday for the Orient, will carry to Japan
$-.500,000 In gold bullion. Although no longer
enjoying the distinction of being the biggest,
the China Is still the handsomest of Pacific
Mail liners, and many travelers prefer her to
her younger, bigger sisters, The China has
a fine record for regularity and probably the
roomiest passenger accommodations of any
vessel out of this port.
The taking off of the liner Gaelic and the
consequent readjustment of the Joint schedule
will Invoke some hard work for the Pacific
Mail Company's dock force. The Doric, the
next vessel due. should be here January 13.
The Manchuria, however, due after the Doric,
will call before the O. and O. boat. The Man
churia is scheduled to call January 21. but
it Is not likely that she will. In order to get
her home as speedily as possible she will
omit calling at Shanghai and Honolulu. Bhe
will come direct frem Yokohama. She has
not yet reached the Japanese port, however,
and as the run will occupy at least twelve
days, the margin for discharging and reload
ing will be too narrow to admit of her being
ready for eea again by January 21. The Doric
will not sail until February 2.
Hawaii Is Still on Fire.
A cable received yesterday from Kobe con
tains the Information that the barkentlne Ha
waii is still on Are, but that the flames are
under control. The Hawaii reached Kobe the
other day with a cargo of fertilizer. She had
a rough trip, and her cargo had been on fire
during the voyage. Eleven feet of mater,
pumped Into her hold, was supposed to have
extinguished tbe fire, and so it was reported
on the vessel's arrival. This now appears to

her sustaining any serious damage. ,
British Ship Uninsurable.
The finding of two life-preservers from the
overdue British ship Edith Mary, now out
105 days from Ascension for St. Johns, re
sulted yesterday in the vessel being declared
uninsurable. She was quoted at 85 per cent.
The only vessel left In the overdue list is
the British bark Stork, whose chances are
considered slight. She Is out 109 days from
Hudson Bay for London and Is quoted at 70
per cent.
Athos Reaches Colon.
The steamship Athos, among whose passen
gers are fifty delegates from Baltimore to the
Pan-American Medical Congress at Panama,
arrived yesterday at Colon. The vessel was
four days overdue, and her failure to arrive
caused considerable anxiety.
Sea Rover Has Lakme in Tow.
The steam schooner North Fork arrived yes
terday from Eureka, from which port she
started with the waterlogged steamir Ijkme

Judge Seawell Determines
Right to Collect Taxes
From United Railroads
MONEY IS ON DEPOSIT
Before Payment Is Finally
Made Question Will Go
to the Supreme Court
The conflicting" claims between the
State andrthis city and county as to
the right of collecting taxes from the
United Railroads were decided in favor
of the local government yesterday by
Judge Seawell, and will be at once car
ried to the Supreme Court for final de
termination.
The purchase of the San Francisco
and San Mateo electric line by the
United Railroads was the sticking point
in the controversy. State Controller
E. P. Colgan contended that in making
the inter-county route a part of the
United Railroads system the company
was brought under the law relating to
the taxation of railroads operating in
two or more counties. Tax Collector E.
J. Smith of this county held that the
United Railroads was a local corpora
tion, and its property, including fran
chise, equipment, etc., should be locally
taxed up to the county line.
Though pprfectly willing to pay its
taxes to whomsoever they were due,
the United Railroads did not want to
become liable for double'payment by
making thf mistake of paying to the
wrong claimant, and therefore the mat
ter was brought to court with the de
mand that the conflicting parties
should set forth their respective claims.
Colgan and Smith responded, as did
Collector Frank M. Granger of San Ma
teo County and M. F. Boland of San
Mateo city. The railroads, pending the
decision, gave Judge Seawell a check
for $364,572 79. This was the county's
assessment, as against 1331,579 30 de
manded by the State Controller.
By Judge Seawell's decision the city
gains about $33,000.
SANTA FE SENDS GLAD
TIDINGS TO LAUNDRYMEN
Issues Edict Against Use of Celluloid
and Rubber Collars by Its
Trainmen.
Rubber and celluloid collars have
been tabooed by the Santa Fe Com
pany. According to a circular issued
from the office of Trainmaster E. A.
Austin at Topeka, It will hereafter be
a serious offense for a trainman to
edorn his neck with one of these pro
ducts of a gigantic trust.
Heretofore the conductors and
brakemen of Santa Fe trains have
found it convenient to go to a wash
room and clean their waterproof col
lars after a long and dusty run. It
meant the saving of much laundry ex
pense. Naturally their faces are
wearing mournful expressions since
the edict. Hereafter they will be
compelled to carry in their valises ex
tra collars. Trainmaster Austin's or
der, copies of which have just been
received at this end of the line, reads
as follows:
My attention has recently been called to the j
fact that some of our passenger trainmen are
Wearing rubber and celluloid collars. This Is
a practice that the management will not per
mit, and you will be governed accordingly.
The Santa Fe, as well as other j
transcontinental railroads, has fixed |
rules relative to the uniforms of its
trainmen, and it deems it within its
province to dictate what kind of hab- \
erdashery its employes shall wear.

STATE LAW PROPOSED
Dealers Desire That Pub
lic Buildings Be Made
to Foster an Industry
The cement men of the State are
about to introduce a bill in the Legis
lature for the purpose of fostering the
cement industry of California. Import
ed cements are being used on a number
of buildings being put up at public ex
pense, and the effort will be to have
the bill framed so as to prevent the
use of anything but State or United
States material in public structures.
| The cement men, of whom Colonel
j George Stone, chairman of the Repub
| lican State Central Committee is a
; prominent member, think that Califor
j nia cement should be used in the con-
I struction of California Hall at the Uni
versity of California. Counter claims
are made that the imported cement is
better adapted for certain class of
work. However, the local cement deal
ers believe that it will be a saving of
about 75 cents a barrel if the Solano or
San Joaquin cement can be substituted
for ihat imported from England.
There has not been much competi
! tion, however, with the foreign cement
| market of late. Shipments to Califor
i nia have not been largeânot more than
one-fourth of the volume of four years
ago. There has been a very good class
of cement mined In this State and the
promoters of the "cement bill" want to
j foster the Industry, so they declare.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL
lOHX D. BPRJHXTKKLS ...,..Â»<. Proprietor
ADDRESS ALL, COMMUNICATIONS TO
.JOHN McNAUGHT Manager
t BLICATTON OFFICE THIRD AND MARKET STREETS, SAN FRANCISCO j
SATURDAY JANUARY 7, 1905 j
'HpHE joint Congressional commission has made a unanimous re-
I port, accompanied by a bill for an act covering the subject of
* the restoration of the American merchant marine. The com
mission visited all the leading seaports on both coasts and took the
testimony of ship owners, ship builders, shippers, marine under
. writers and all interested parties. The investigation was very com
' prehensive, and it is gratifying that the members of both parties
making it have been able to reach an agreement.
Heretofore partisan differences have much hindered a proper
consideration of this important subject. All business men agreed
that the diversion of $100,000,000 a year to pay foreign sfcips for
doing our deep water trade is a waste of the national resources,
and that the lack of an adequate merchant marine was eliminating
the seagoing character of our people. This is a serious matter for
a country with the longest coast line in the world, and with a for
eign trade by sea of such immense volume as ours. But what all
business men agreed upon was the subject of partisan differences,
which it may be hoped will now disappear in the presence of this
unanimous report.
The bill provides a graduated tonnage bounty, running from
$2 50 to $5 per ton, according to the time the ship is employed in
commerce, and for mail contracts on both oceans. A tonnage tax of
8 and 16 cents per ton on foreign ships entering our ports is pro
vided for, this tax not to exceed 80 cents and $1 60 per ton in any
one year on the same ship. The tonnage tax now runs from 3to 6
cents per ton. The increase is intended to give the preference to
American ships. It may not prove of importance, as the maritime
nations with which we tr*ade may impose a tax of equal amount on
American ships, thus equalizing the influence of this tax upon freight
rates. The proposed bill differentiates this tonnage tax by levying
8 cents on ships entering our ports from any foreign port in North
America, the West Indies, Bahamas, the Caribbean coast of South
America or Newfoundland, and 16 cents per ton on ships entering
â¢our ports from any other foreign country. On ships of the latter
class the annual total tax shall not exceed $1 60 per ton.
One of the important provisions of the bill is for American ap
prentices on ships that receive its benefits. These apprentices are to
be trained in navigation and engineering. The apprentices are*to be
one for the ship and one for each thousand of her net registered
tonnage. This will give on ships of the class of our "Pacific liners
from ten to fifteen American apprentice boys, who are trained as
able seamen, navigators and engineers, and are qualified for service
in the navy and to become masters of ships. This is an extremely de
sirable feature of the law. There has been felt a doubt whether
American boys will seek a seafaring life. But their aversion may
run to existing conditions under which there is no regular system
of apprenticeship and boys on shipboard are left to learn seaman
ship at haphazard. That American boys will seek a seagoing life
seems to be proved by the large number that enlist as cadets in the
.various naval training schools and ships. There they are under
conditions that give them discipline and knowledge, and though in
the navy they can go no higher than the position of yeoman the
applications for admission overtax the facilities of the schools. When
they can article on a merchant ship under conditions quite as favor
able for discipline and training and. can hope to qualify themselves
â¢as officers and shipmasters, we are persuaded that they will im
prove their opportunity.
In the day of the old wooden ships there was no lack of native
American sailors. The sea life was then a lure anÂ«i the place to
hunt for a runaway boy was on board ship. This spirit declined
with our merchant marine, and the so-called American sailors on
our ships are 90 per cent foreigners. It may be truthfully said
that a revival of our merchant marine will fail of one of its important
purposes if it be not accompanied by a revival of the seagoing spirit
of our people. Therefore this provision for apprentices is wise and
in line with the whole movement to put our flag again over the seas
and to send our commerce in American bottoms.
THE SUNDAY CALL FICTION CONTEST.
PROBABLY no feature ever instituted by a daily paper has
leaped so quickly into popular favor or aroused interest in so
unexpected and so wide a field as the fiction contest for West
ern writers which was inaugurated in the Sunday Call two months
ago. It is no extravagance to state that practically every county in
the State of California has been represented by contributions many
times over, and, more surprising still, practically every State in
the Union. During the current week manuscripts were received
from eleven States outside of California, and the coast States, the
manuscripts coming respectively from Madison, S. D.; Chilicothe,
Wyo.; Merriwell, Wis.; Wichita, Kans.; Falls City, Nebr.; Haver
hill, Mass.; Mankato. Mich.; Beloit, Wis.; Lake Mills, Wis.; Jack
son, Term.; Easton, Pa.; Waterford, Buffalo and other points in New
York State, notably one from a West Point army officer.
Of course the contest is what the advertisement defines, a fiction
contest for Western writers, and most of the contributors from
abroad justify their entry of manuscripts upon the ground that they
are residents of California who have drifted East. But it is inter
esting and significant to note the widespread interest taken in a
.contest for original fiction instituted by a daily paper in view of
the hidebound belief that has so long been maintained that only the
â¢ standard magazines and weeklies can conduct contests of this nature
successfully. It only serves to emphasize what the Sunday Call has
long maintained: that the old sensational supplement is a thing of
the past, and in its stead has come a cleaner, saner, more whole
some and more literary weekly magazine.
In point of number the contributors have been legion. Not only
new writers, paving the way to break into the magazine field, but
writers already famous have'contributed material for selection. The
prize story for the past week is from the pen of Hallie Erminie
Rives, author of "The Castaway," a writer whose work has probably
never before been submitted for original publication in a daily paper.
But the majority of selections will be made from the contributions
of the newer writers; an occasional story from an experienced writer
will only serve to show how high the standard of the contest is. The
work of new writers, however strong and original, often needs some
slight charity toward overlooking the crudities that inevitably go
with inexperience. It is in this liberal spirit that the present contest
is being conducted. < ________________

INDIAN SUMMER
THE barbaric red of the parasol
which she presently unfurled
when with a sort of aimless re-
luctance she had passed down
the steps and out Into the Septem
ber sunshine formed a vivid back
ground for the small, well-set head
and face which was at once humor
ous and quizzical, as If the pageant
of life had raised in her an eternal
question and an accompanying smile.
At the distance of half a block the
trim figure in its severe white pique
seemed .ail girl. A closer approach,
however, showed in the wavy dark
hair isolated silver threads âthose out
riders of Time which come to lay low
the loveliest.
And, indeed, only a few days before
two placid matrons who had cast off
their girlish slimness as a snake does
its skin and achieved in its place solid
ity and double chins might have been
heard discussing her case.
"Strange that Elizabeth Ware doesn't
marry!" observed one, as with eyes,
bent upon her embroidery hoop she
caused a strange floral piece to bloom
upon a piece of white linen. "She's
getting on. Let me see. She was in
the next class to me at Madame Dore's,
and Harold will be 14 next October!"
Harold was her eldest childâone of
those cantankerous pegs by which ma
trons keep tab on the age of their
unmarried friends.
"She must be nearly 35 if she's a
day," the speaker concluded after a
brief pause, in which she debated with
herself what would be the proper
shade of green to use for maidenhair
ft m. "Her time is growing short."
Her companion, engaged in a simi
lar employment, looked meditatively
off over the smooth-shaven lawn
which seemed to share her own do
mestic placidity.
"Thirty-four, I think," she an
nounced in a voice whose preoccupa
tion suggested that she had been rum
maging in that prehistoric past which
contained neither husband nor babies.
"ThUrty-four, I'm pretty sure. Still,
she certainly doesn't look It, and she's
always had plenty of attention."
In the absorbing interest of the
flowers they were fashioning the sub
ject was dropped, but the thought
wave then started reached Elizabeth
Ware herself later on.
It was a wonderful day, full of mel
low, mature, Indescribable charm.
"Summer grows wise," Elizabeth
thought to herself; "no longer daz
zling and shriveling, but flooding the
world with tender light, veiling its
splendors in mists."
The strong, white, ungloved hands
twirled the parasol thoughtfully while
their owner drew in a deep breath.
There was something in the day that
stirred memories, brought back half
forgotten flirtations, filled her thoughts
with a vague, beautiful regretâthe
loss of something she had never
known.
Somewhere about a locust shrilled
its warning; of the frosts to come.
Miss Ware's eyes grew dreamy, pen
sive with that questioning of the fu
ture which will disturb the mind of
the unmated woman until the last
fence Is reached.
Had she, perchance, made a mis
take? She thought of her school
friends wrapped in contentment âand
flesh âwho no longer seemed contem
poraries. They had secured their
matrimonial prizes. Yes, and sat down
by the roadside of life, with nb desire
to fare farther! So far as she knew
all were mildly happy. But beside
them she felt ridiculously young and
joyous. A smile touched her lips as
she reflected that it was with Harold,
the 14-year-old that she preferred to
walk and talk, rather than with Har
old's plump and settled mamma.
Then she reviewed the thirty-five
years that stretched behind her, flam
ing like the tail of a comet, with
variety, with pleasant wanderings,
with an ever-changing group of men

Just as she reached this energetic

said warmly.

negative the approaching figure of a
man held her idle gaze. As he came ]
nearer a smile of pleased recognition
lighted her face. She could scarcely
believe her eyes! Fergus Blynn. lined
and his meaning deepened by his ten
years of absence, but still undeniably
Fergus.
Before the gladness of the surprise
died out.of her eyes he had seen her
and they\ were wringing each other's
hands in smiling delight.
"The same old Elizabeth," he said
warmly, and yet, with a little wonder
in his voice, which made her feel like
an anomaly: "You used to be about
my age, but great Scott! You might
Blmost pass for my daughter now.
How do you manage it, and who's the !
happy man?"
He was walking beside her, and
Elizabeth turned her face to him in
quiringly. Then it dawned upon her
and she voiced a rather superior
"Oh!" before she proceeded to explain
that her life partner tarried unac
countably. , Blynn eyed her shrewdly.
"You seem to pass the waiting with
a good deal of satisfaction to your
self," he laughed; "that Is, if one
may Judge from appearances."
"You are married, of course?" she
questioned, after she had assured him
that one might. He shook his head
with blithe gayety.
"Yet I suppose we are the ones out
of all that old set who would have j
been picked out as likely to make
early marriages," he went on. "How
under the sun do you account for it?"
"It's one of the things that can
only be accounted for on the theory
that we are both wise beyond our
time," was the mock-grave answer.
Then In a teasing tone she continued:
"My! but you're going to have a love
ly time! There are about two dozen
little and big Johns, Marys, Charlies
and Franks for you to admire."
" 'This is your Uncle Fergus,' the
fond parents will say. 'He and I used
to go to school together,' 'Oh, papa,

On and on they walked, talking
with undiminished interest. As he re
marked, in reply to her suggestion
that it was time she turned toward
home, the more thgy talked the
: more they had to say.

a girl with no nonsense about her;
but he could not remember that in
the exuberant days of his youth, when
he had made love in turns to most of
the girls of their set, he had ever
included her. As he watched her now
Irom the corner of his eye, losing no
' whit of her mature grace, he won-
I dered by what charm she had been
held immune.
I Up to the moment of their acci-
I dental meeting if he had thought of
, her at all his mind had only brushed
! her identity along with the group of
! old friends, all of whom it would be
j a gentle, half-sad pleasure to see
I again, if, only to fix a standard by
! which to measure how far he had
j gone. For it is only thus âby com- >
| paring ourselves with the friends with
I whom we were once abreast âthat we ,
j can gauge our progress or estimate j
I our failures.
| Yet now he had a curious sensation
of having stumbled upon something
that he had craved âsomething, the
lack of which had made him restless
and ill at ease, and as the conviction i
overspread his mind in all its amaz- i
ing certainty, his manner grew ab- I
stracted. Then he became alert with
a sudden purpose. With something
of his old impetuosity he reasoned :
that here was a matter that had been !
deferred long enough.
If his instinct told him so much at
that first meeting, he was doubly sure
of it at the end of the following 1
month. He seemed now to himself
to have returned home for the ex- j
! press purpose of seeing Elizabeth.
' Her society was like long draughts of
! cool water from some boyhood's well.
!He hadn't thought much about the
water at the timeâone never does!
He had supposed that all water was
cool, clear and refreshing. He knew
better now. There was but one such
well âbut one Elizabeth!
"It isn't decent for a woman of your
age to be husbandless," was his scorn
ful way of beginning the attack.
"Oh, I don't know," was the lady's
easy rejoinder. "We spinsters have
our uses. Think how we serve to
point morals. Why, I've no doubt
that I myself have been the object
I lesson that has saved more than one
sweet young thing from celibacy. I
can just imagine a mother saying.
'You'd better not be too particular or
you'll be an old maid like Beth
Ware!' "
He grinned Into the dark, debonair
face for a moment and then scowled
portentously.
"You've had your own way too
long, young lady!** What you need is
the subduing effect of masculine guid
ance, and frankly I should like the
post."
"Remember, you let me go away
once before," he went on In an ag
grieved tone, seeing that she was
about to protest. "Of course you did.
|If you had been the right sort of a
i girl, wouldn't- you have taught me
! that I loved you even then?"
She laughed outright.
"I happen to remember that you
were head over heels in love with
j Harold's mamma about that time,"
| she jeered. "Anyway, we're too old
I for sentiment. Our spring and sum
mer are over."
"Yes, they are," he admitted with
gravity. "But this love of ours"âhis
tone rang with the mastery of one
who Is sureâ"we'll call It Indian
summer!"

their daughter, Miss Irene Sabin, last j
evening by giving a ball in their hand- i
some and spacious home on California

The Board of Education is preparing

â¢ . ieachers is held next June seventy-flve
teachers will have been appointed.
Tho board is instituting inquiries

â¢ of the spring term on January 16, the

POSTUM CEREAL.
GOT ALONG.
A Pretty Girl of 17 With Energy.
"During the winter of 1901-02 (I was
then 17 years of age) I attended a
grammar school in Rolla, N. Dak.,
staying with some friends of ours and
â¢working for my board between school
hours.
"I used to get up early in the morn
ing to do my housework, but as those
people got up very late I would not
,cook breakfast but only make the cof
fee. Tired of working and in a hurry
to go to school I would eat but a snack
and a cup of strong coffee for my
breakfast and it was not long until
I got to be nervous, had headaches
and could not sleep.
"One day our Professor Young was
telling us what effect coffee had on
one's aystem. I compared his words
with how 1 felt and found that coffee
was ruining my health. So I tried to
quit but found I was a slave to it,
but quit Just the same. I did not
know what to drinkâl hated milk or
tea, so I would drink nothing but
water; got poor and thin and finally
left school to remove to Belma, Wash.,
where at present, by the constant use
of Postum, you can find me a bright,
healthy girl. After we settled down
papa opened a grocery store.
"At this time I was so ill I could
not do a thing, and mama was anxious
about me. She would prepare some
coffee and try to have me drink it in
place of water, but every time I drank
it I noticed it made me worse. One
day while I was looking around in the
store I noticed your Postum as a food
drink. I asked papa if he knew what
it was, but he said he did not but found
he had to keep it, so I took a package
of it home and said I would try it,
made it according to directions and It
was delicious. After using Postum two
weeks I was much less nervous and
noticed I was getting a little fatter,
so I persuaded mama to use it for the
whole family. Every one of them liked
it and now they all complain if they
cannot have Postum.
"After a while I got to be healthy
and tired of being indoors I went out
to take orders for the store and many
a customer I persuaded to use Postum.
"One lady told me that they used
coffee because they could get premiums
for the wrappers, but she admitted
they did not like coffee at all. I left
them a package of Postum on trial
and the next time I came areund she
returned itâsaid they did not like it.
She hadn't made it right. It was
about dinner time, so I said, 'Let me
make It for you; I am sure you will
like It,' so I nrepared the drink accord
ing to directions and had dinner with
them and they all said it was delicious
and have used nothing else since. That
lady thanked me afterward for Postr
urn; it improved their health, she said."

SUCCESS AS AFFIUS IN "THE
ETERNAL LIGHT."
The students of the Santa Clara Col
lege are making great preparations for
the production of their latest play,
which will be given by them at the
Alhambra Theater on February 8. The
play, which is called "The Light Eter

a member of the junior class of the
college. It deals with the rivalry of
two students, afterward soldiers, in
the reign of Emperor Diocletian of
Rome.
A strong character in the production
is Affms, which will be portrayed by
August Aguirre. In the original pro
duction of the play at the college his
success was so great that the young
student won exceptional honors. Many
of the Santa Clara alumni who failed
to see the play at the college will take
advantage of the opportunity to visit
the city and see it at the Alhambra,
More than 150 students will also be
present from the college.

LEGAL GIANTS
OPEN BATTLE
Contest to Have Dunsmuir
Will Proceedings Thrown
From Court Is Commenced
BIG FIGHT IN PROSPECT
Attorney Campbell Occupies
j Both Sessions of the Court
j in Mrs. Hopper's Interests
The scene of the controversy over the
late Alexander Dunsmuir's millions was
shifted yesterday to Judge Coffey's de
partment of the Superior Court, where
the attorneys for Edna Wallace Hopper
and Joan Olive Dunsmuir, the latter
the mother of the deceased, are seeking
to set aside the judgment of the Supe
rior Court of May 9, 1900, by which
Dunsmuir's will was admitted to pro
bate and his brother James appointed
as executor. In the array of local and
British Columbian legal talent were J.
C. Campbell, representing Mrs. Hop
per; Sir Charles H. Tupper, E. V. Bod
well and Alexander Heyneman, for Mrs.
Dunsmuir; A. P. Luxton and Andrew
Thome, for James Dunsmuir as execu
tor, and Charles S. Wheeler, especially
engaged to represent James Dunsmuir
personally.
If the present proceedings succeed
the way will be opened for an attack
upon the "common form" probate of
the will in British Columbia, and then
will follow the contest of the step
daughter and aged mother of the mil
lionaire against his disposition of the
fortune.
Mr. Campbell opened the proceedings
yesterday by presenting his petition to
set aside the judgment on the ground
that the court had no jurisdiction of
the subject matter of the estate or of
the persons interested. He offered in
evidence an exemplified copy of the will
and the petition of James Dunsmuir
for its admission to probate. Mrs. Hop
per's attorney has three points of at
tack. First, that there is no limit upon
the time in which the judgment may be
revoked, because the judgment was
void in the beginning; second, that the
admission of the will to probate In
common form in British Columbia was
not a sufficient record upon which to
base its admission here without the
usual evidence, and the third, relating
to the jurisdiction of the court in
granting ancillary probate under the
laws of California. The latter question
will be discussed by Mr. Campbell next
Tuesday morning, to which time the
hearing was adjourned.
On the first point, anticipating the
other side would plead that the pro
ceedings were barred, Mr. Campbell
contended that as the judgment was
void in the beginning there couid be no
limitation on the time within which it
could be revoked. He cited authorities
and gave instances wherein several
years had elapsed before proceedings
of this kind were instituted. He then
temporarily surrendered the floor to
Mr. Bodwell, who went into a detailed
explanation to the court of the rules of
practice in British Columbia, particu
larly with relation to the common and
solemn forms of probate. He said that
under the former, as in Dunsmuir's
case, the will was admitted upon the
affidavit of the executor and the order
could be revoked at any time, while
the solemn form could only be revoked
in case of fraud. He quoted English
law and authorities to show that there
was no time limit for the revocation of
probate proceedings and also to prove
that wills must be probated according
to the laws of the country wherein they
were executed.
Mr. Campbell, resuming, then dis
cussed the judgment roll of the British
Columbian court relating to the pro
bate of Dunsmuir's will and its rela
tion to the subsequent proceedings in
the San Francisco court. ,He declared
the record strange and wonderful, in
that the will had been probated In two
Jurisdictions without having been
sworn to by the attesting witnesses
in either court. He compared the pro
cedure to that of a man lifting himself
over the fence by his own boot p traps.
Judge Coyne was not present in court,
being confined to his hotel by illness.

arrival of the Wiley B. Allen Company
in San Francisco they have proven a

this firm is one of ths most potent fig

is safe to prophesy concerning the new
representation, that never in the history
of the Knabe piano has it received on
the Pacific Coast the active handling
that it will receive at the hands of the
Wiley B. Allen Company, whose healths,
forceful methods have put them Into the
front rank of the retail piano forces in

Its unassailable position makes it a value

its artistic qualities emphasise the fact
that it is unique among the great pianos

contract?" asked the retiring official.
"That's what you did," answered
Lloyd, and President Spreckels added,
"And that reminds me that we ought
to give the Commissioner a vote of
thanks for his good work." The vote
of thanks was forthwith cast.
There were present at the meeting all
of the Commissioners âMessrs. Dingee,
Lloyd, Cummings and Sullivan and
President Adolph Spreckels In the
chair.
Superintendent McLaren made a re
port of work done during December in
Golden Gate and other city parks, and
said that he was getting ready for
work on the new athletic track. He
would require twelve horses of about
1500 pounds weight, and the commis
sion will advertise for bids for them.
Scrapers and other implements will be
needed. Their purchase was authorized.
GIFT ACKNOWLEDGED.
The reports of the Japanese tea gar
den and the children's playground
showed an excess of expenditures over
receipts during December, but the
amounts of the deficits were not great
er than usual.
Ths. offer of Nat Raphael to permit
the park teams to haul away clay from
a lot owned by him on Second street,
near Harrison, was declined, as the dis
tance of the lot from the park is too
great.
The Atlantic, Gulf and Pacific Com
pany was given permission to maintain
a blacksmith shop near the Olympic
salt water pier during the work of re
pairing.
The Smithsonian Institution, by Frank
Baker, superintendent, wrote to thank
the commission for the five large pho
tographs of Golden Gate Park present
ed to the national collection.
Commissicner Lloyd submitted copies
of the contract he had drawn up for
the board and Lyons & Co., successful
bidders for the Park News privilege.
The application of Quirk Brothers for
a return of $155, the amount paid for
one month's privilege of publishing the
News, was denied. The board received
a communication from Aaron Altmann
thanking it for greens from the park
for the decoration of the banquet hall
at the California Hotel, in which Mr.
Altmann was recently married.
A committee of four from the Ama
teur Athletic Driving Association, com
prised of Messrs. Frank O'Kane, W.
J. Simpson, I. L Borden and T. J.
Douglas, appeared before the board to
tender a check for $20,000, collected by
the association on behalf of the new
-athletic track, Golden Gate Park. All
of the money promised by the associa
tion has not yet been collected, but to
show good faith and confidence In the
project the association advanced part
of the sum.
QUESTION OF TRACK.
Mr. Borden said he thought that
horsemen would prefer a half mile
track to a three-quarter mile one.
President Spreckels thought that the
three-quarter mile track was preferable
and Mr. Borden added that while the
longer course might not suit all horse
j men they would nevertheless be satls
l fled with the track as planned because
! the automobile, bicycle, polo and other
I sports would be better provided for on
a three-quarter stretch.
The Police Department, at the re
quest of President Spreckels, made re
port that Policeman Kessing had ar
rested R. H. Trout for driving an auto
mobile beyond the speed limit. The
number on the machine did not cor
respond with Trout's permit. Trout
told President Spreckels that the
change of numbers was due to his ma
i chine having broken down and the
number on it was then substituted. It
transpired, after investigation, that
I Trout was running his auto too fast
I and he will be cited to appear before
the commissioners and show cause why
his permit should not be revoked.
Complaint was received from resi
dents near Lafayette square of certain
drifting sand. They do not know
whether the sand is on street or park
property. The matter was referred to
the City and County Attorney for in
vestigation. The squatters on Frank
lin square, Sixteenth and Bryant
streets, will be proceeded against by
the City Attorney.
The contract for furnishing 1200 cubic
yards of clay for the park was award
ed to Owen McHugh for 78 cents per
cubic yard.
The United States Life Saving Sta
tion at the beach has been using park
water and the Government has been
notified that a charge for same will
be made. Sheehan's place at the beach
has paid $80 for water taken during
eight months from park pipes without
the consent of the commission.

HEACOCK WILL
DETAIN LEE
Expresses Belief That Women
Identifying Accused Could
Not Have Been Misled
REPUTATION IS GOOD
Detective Gibson Says It
Was Defendant's Brother
He Arrested for Crime
During the course of the hearing
yesterday of the case of the United
States against Le Roy Lee, Commis
sioner Heacock intimated that he
would hold the accused to answer be
fore the Grand Jury, Judge Heacock
said:
The defendant himself has testified that he
was In Mrs. Vallade's delicatessen store daily,
or nearly every day. for two months. His
features are very marked, and seeing him
even once you would know him again. It 1Â»
beyond the range vi probability that he is
not tbe Derson whom Mrs. Vallade and her
daughter have identified as the man who pass
ed a raised one-dollar stiver certlflcato on them
on IVivmber 20. They have positively iden
tified him as the man who waa there on Mon
day evening and on Friday evening. From
the testimony before me I have no doubts as
to his Identity.
The remarks quoted were incited by
the request of R. N. Frick, of counsel
for Lee, for an adjournment until
this morning so that he might procure
the attendance of a witness who
would swear that a man resembling
the defendant, but not he, had passed
at a bakery on the same street a $1
bill raised to a $20 bill. Judge Hea
cock granted the request for an ad
journment until 10 o'clock this morn
ing and then made the remarks Just
quoted.*
Lee produced J. M, Schuler, a mer
chant; F. J. King Jr., a butcher, and
James F. Lodge, an attorney, all of
Siskiyou County, who testified that
Lee's reputation and character for
truth and honesty were of the best.
John M. Featherston, secretary for
Redington & Co., whosale druggists,
gave similar testimony.
Police Detective E. L. Gibson swore
that he had been under the impres
sion that he had arrested the defend
ant twenty years ago for forgery. On
further investigation he said he found
that it was Lee's brother, Lyman Lee,
whom he had arrested on that occa
sion.
The defendant went on the stand to
correct a statement he had made un
der oath on the preceding day when
he said that he had never been ar
rested before. He said that he had
forgotten at the â¢time his arrest sev
eral years ago for having deer meat
in his possession during the close sea
son while camping. He had been ac
quitted on that charee.
SEPARATED FROM WIFE,
BOYD KILLS HIMSELF

DUCK SHOOTING SEASON IS AT ITS HEIGHT
The storm of last week scattered the
ducks and thus impaired the New
Year's day shooting on the marshes
about the bay. The scattering of the
birds is considered only temporary and
good sport is expected while the
weather remains cold and clear.
The season is at its height just now.
One indication of this is fbund in the
fact that the ammunition houses can
hardly turn out shells in sufficient
numbers to meet the demand.
There are but few canvasbacks in
the market, although they are in the
bay in great numbers. There were but
three of these birds in sixty sacks of
ducks received in the markets in one
day recently.
Otto Feudner and Mr. Hoffman had
a good shoot at San Pablo last Sunday
and Monday, securing eighty-four cans.

game birds that are brought to this
city.

CROWDS CHEER
OLD CHAMPION
Give Greyhound Pocatelli
a Hearty Reception When
He Appears on the Field
That the public dearly loves a cham
pion was demonstrated last Sunday at
Union Coursing Park. Pocatelli, the
great greyhound, which has been in re
tirement for several months, was sent
out as a relief dog during one of the
trials to get a little running. The spec
tators recognized the handsome hound
at once and cheered him as he showed
all his old-time cleverness and much of
his former speed.
The up-country greyhound is entered
in the stake to be run to-morrow. He
meets Forest Fire in his first course,
which he should win handily. After
that the competition will grow warmer
as each succeeding round is run, and it
will need all his former speed to land
him the ultimate winner.
P. Doyle has decided to retire Lib
erator, which coursing men have called
the "iron dog," from the field. He will
be placed in the stud and much is ex
pected of him there. Liberator is by
Fear Not-Lady Thorndyke, and has
been noted for his cleverness and for
his great stamina, coupled with aver
age speed. He won many stakes and
has â¢ seldom been outside the money.
Week after week he has been in the
thick of the competition and has al

A match race and an open stake will

moving. Charles McDonald also shot
at Sears Point and secured twenty-one
birds.
The shooting on the Empire Gun Club
preserve this season has been the best
in the history of the club, English
snipe, ducks and quail being plentiful
on the Monterey preserve. Considerable
annoyance has been caused recently by
poachers, and the club has decided to
no longer tolerate this nuisance. It has
set aside a fund for the prosecution of
all intruders. The keeper's force will be
doubled and a keen watch will be.kept
for all offenders against the law. They
will be prosecuted to the bitter end. The
club's trapshooting grounds will be
opened at Alameda Point on Sunday,
March 12, and will remain open there
after on the second Sunday of each
month" until the trapshooting season
ends.

ONE OF H. W. KELLER'S CANDI
DATES FOR HONORS IN ALL
AGE STAKE AT BAKERSFIELD.
FIELD TRIALS
ARE PROMISING
Many Sportsmen Will Go to
Bakersfield to See the
Hunting Dogs in Action
Everything is in readiness for the
twenty-second annua! meet of the Pa
cific Coast Field Trials Club, which
will open on the Haggin and Tevis
property near* Bakersfield on Monday.
The handlers of the high class setters
and pointers entered for the trials re
port the conditions as good. The rain
came at an opportune time, one inch
falling last Friday and helping matters
greatly.
Many of the well known sportsmen
who enjoy seeing the work in the field
of these intelligent dogs, will leave for
the scene to-day. This will give them
an opportunity for a shoot to-morrow
c-n quail or ducks. Those who cannot
get away to-day will go down to-mor
row morning, arriving in time to wit
ness the draw.
H. W. Keller, the Santa Monica
sportsman, will have several represen
tatives in the trials. One of his favor
ites will be Sombro, which will be han
dled by W. B. Coutts in the all-age
stake. She finished third in the mem
bers' stake last year and divided third
with Keepsake in the derby. She was
bred by W. W. Van Arsdale and is
by Llewellin Drake-Shadow.
She was sent East last year, but like
all California-bred field dogs she was
not familiar with prairie chickens and
did not do well. The California dogs
are disciplined for hunting barn-yard
fowl and they associate the prairie
chickens for these.
The Eastern Field Trials Club is the
only organization of this character
which is older than the California club,
having been organized some two years
in advance of it.
ARTHUR WILD ARRESTED
UNDER STRONG SUSPICION
Is Suspected of Being a Confederate
of Gang of Clothing
Thieves.
Arthur Wild was arrested yesterday
by Detectives Regan and O'Connell
of the Southern Police Station as one
of a pair of men who have been steal
ing on a large scale from clothing
stores in the district south of Market
street.
The police say that Wild worked
with a confederate and that the two
have stolen seventy-eight pairs of
trousers, as well as other clothing dur
ing the last week. Wild was arrested
while attempting to dispose of sixteen
pairs of trousers in a second-hand
store at Sixth nvd Howard streets. It
was the practice of the two to enter
a store and while one fitted on a suit
of clothes, under the pretense of mak
ing a purchase, the other dexterously
filled a grip.'*
Wild is a man about 25 years of
age, well dressed and of smooth man
ners.
Some men must get tight before they
can let themselves loose.
PLAYERS REST
FOR A SPELL
No Tennis Tournaments
âºScheduled on California
Club or on Public Courts
There will be no tennis tournaments on
the Golden Gate Park or on the Califor
nia Club courts to-morrow. The mem
bers of the latter organization have en
gaged in many tournaments during the
last few weeks and they will be given
a rest for some time. Nothing is
scheduled at present except the con
tinuous tournament, which will move
more smoothly in future.
The players who frequent the park
courts' have had a long and much need
ed rest from tournament play. They
have not met in match play for about
two months, and every man in the park
is anxiously awaiting the first tourna
ment of the new year. This event is
set for the 15th inst. It will be a handi
cap singles tournament and it is ex
pected that there will be in the neigh
borhood of one hundred players. A sim
ilar event held about a year ago on
the public courts was won by Clarence
Griffin. One hundred and four players,
the largest number ever entered in a
tournament in this section of the coun
try, competed. As the juvenile club has
more than fifty members, all of whom
will probably participate, the entry list
should be even larger than it was a
year ago. Entries for the event close
on the 12th and should be sent to J. M.
Baker, secretary of the club, at Oak
and Stanyan streets.
With nothing else to take up the at
tention of the tennis players the con
tinuous tournament at the California
Club should prove a marked success.
Most of the players in the different
classes are evenly matched and the
rivalry between them is keen. There
will be a great struggle for the first
place. George Janes has gone to the
top and will be a hard man to dis
lodge. Collier almost turned the trick
last Saturday, when Janes beat him by
the narrowest of margins.
Collier Is improving;, and when he
meets Janes to-morrow the enthusiasts
look for a great match. Janes is also
Improving and in a short time should
leave Collier far behind.
At present the fight for first place
seems to be between Janes and Collier,
but there is anpther player who has
been overlooked. He is Dr. Bush, the
number four man. The doctor Joined
the club only a short time ago, but has
had considerable experience in the
East. He has a perfect build for ten
nis and also an excellent style. When
he becomes accustomed to the courts
and gets into his old-time form he
should have no difficulty getting to the
top. Last Monday he beat Harry Rolfe,
and will dispose of Cornell easily. This
will put him next to Collier. There will
be some excellent matches when Janes,
Collier and Bush come together.
Carl Gardner and Melville Long are
two others In the first class who will
work their way to the top. Long re
cently graduated from the second class
and is improving rapidly.
In the second class Harold Gabriel is
easily the best. He stands an excellent
chance of going into the first class.
George Cutter has worked his way out
of the third class, but met a stumbling
block in Paul Jones, the number three
man.
In the third class Albert Kenyon and
Moulten Warner are having no trouble
keeping at the top. Kenyon tried to go
up a class, but was beaten by Cutter
in straight sets.
In the fourth class Judge Troutt still
heads the list. He has not played as
yet, but will probably meet Knowlton
to-day. Tbe latter has made more
progress than any man in the tourna
ment. He has gone up eight numbers

financial secretary were the same on
both the "regular" ticket and the
"members' " ticket, the contest taking
place for the offices of commodore, sec

W. G. Morrow, the present commodore,
is desirous of re-election, though the
past season, owing to the continued
opposition of a certain body of the
members, cannot have been altogether
pleasant. He is certain to be nominat
ed as a candidate for the office of com
modore, either on the "regular" ticket
or on a "members' " ticket.

It seemed impossible for a favorite
to get across the line in front at Oak
land yesterday, for in succession Nul
lah, Glendenning, Best Man, Bronze
Wing, Follow Me and Little Wally
went the toboggan route. Of the win
ning horses Sterling Towers, Harry
Beck and The Lady Rohesla were well
supported. The weather was fine and
a large crowd viewed the sport.
Bonner, the colored rider, took the
first event of the day with Jim Neil's
four-year-old Distributor, a SO to 1
shot. The gelding was in front from
the start and, standing a hard drive,
downed Urbano, another outsider, a

did not make good.

Glendenning, which was Installed an

were not ready to decide the Berger
case last night, so action was deferred
for two weeks.
Miller Pleads Guilty.
George Miller pleaded guilty to a
charge of robbery in Judge Lawlor's
court yesterday and will be sentenced
to-day. As there are five prior con
victions against him it is likely that
he will get life imprisonment. On No
vember 20 he held up Richard C.
Malone at Filbert and Fillmore streets,
relieving him of $78 45. He was
caught in the act by Policeman John
S. O'Neil and after an exchange of
shots Miller was captured.

WOMEN MAY WITNESS
THE WRESTLING MATCH
Will Be Admitted Free to Jenkins-
Carkcek Bout When Accom
panied by Escorts.
The number of women who attended
the last wrestling match given under
the management of the Hayes Valley
Club induced Manager Levy to try a
new departure for next Tuesday's bout
between Jack Carkeek and Tom Jen
kins. The fair Â»sex when accompanied
by escorts will be admitted free and the
entire balcony will be reserved for
them. Manager Levy believes there is
no good reason why wrestling should
not become popular with the gentler
sex, which is tabooed from boxing
matches for obvious reasons.
These are busy days in the giants'
training quarters. Carkeek is working
harder than at any previous time for
years in anticipation of a severe bout
fronrKthe rolling mill man. He comes
of a race of natural giants and is never
far from condition, but he is taking no
chances. Jenkins also has a profound
respect for his opponent and is going
through a consistent course of training
at San Rafael.
Considerable interest has been
aroused by the announcement that
George Braun and Al Brill of the Cali
fornia Cycling Club will wrestle a pre
liminary to the big show. Braun is con
sidered unbeatable at his weight, but
he will meet a wiry citizen in Brill.
Radcliffe's Sentence Postponed.
Harry Radcliffe, convicted of mur
der in the second degree, appeared for
sentence in Judge Cook's court yester
day. His attorney made a motion for
a new trial on numerous grounds, in
cluding nearly forty alleged errors of
the Judge and District Attorney. The
Judge ordered that briefs be submitted
by each side on the points raised and
postponed sentence till February 17.
Radcliffe shot and killed Andrew Riley
at Ninth and Sheridan streets on the
morning of June 26.
Life Sentence for a Murderer.
RISING SUJJ, Ind., Jan. 6.âJames
Gillespie, convicted by a jury yester
day of the murder of his twin sister,
Elizabeth, to-day was sentenced to the
penitentiary for life. A re-trial was
denied, but an appeal was granted.

CROKER UNABLE TO EXPLAIN
ACTION OF JOCKEY CLUB
j Officials Decline to Discuss Their Rea
sons in Barring the Horses of
ex-Tammany Man.
LONDON, Jan. 6.âSecretary Weath
erby of the Jockey Club declines to
discuss the reason for the action of the
. Jockey Club in interdicting Richard
Croker from training his horses on
Newmarket Heath, pointing out that
under the Jockey Club ruies it is not
necessary for the stewards to give
reasons for their actions. Mr. Croker
1 wired to the Associated Press from
\ Dublin to-night as follows:
"Have not the slightest idea why the
â  Jockey Club barred my horses from
Newmarket."
} It transpires that Mr. Croker's train-
I er, J. E. Bremer, was summoned to
attend the Jockey Club offices, where
Secretary Weatherby verhally intimat
ed that the stewards would not allow
Mr. Croker's horses to be trained at
Newmarket. In reply to a question
Secretary Weatherby added there was
nothing personally against Bremer.
Curiously, the entries of Mr. Croker's
horses for the forthcoming races have
been accepted by Secretary Weatherby
recently.
In an interview at Dublin to-night
Mr. Croker repeated that he was not
aware of any act on his part which
could have provoked the interdiction.
He said he had no idea what course the
Irish Tu>f Club would take on the
I forty horses he had in Ireland. He had
1 no hesitancy In Baying he took greater
pleasure racing in Ireland than in
either England or America
Accuse Watkins of Embezzlement.
O. J. Watkins, who is connected with
the San Jose Mercantile Company,
with offices in the Crossley building- in
this city, was arrested last night by
the police on a dispatch from San Jose
charging him with embezzlement. He
is accused of embezzling $5000, which
waa invested by many clients in a get
rich-quick concern,
MATCH STILL
HANGING FIRE
Murphy Will Not Meet Neil.
So Greggains Is Trying
to King In Dick Hyland
Frankie Neil, former bantam cham
pion, is about matched to put up his
dukes against Dick Hyland. There is
a slight difference in weight, but that
will probably be patched up shortly.
The Neil-Murphy go is off, as Murphy
wired Aiex Greggains last night that
he had a bout on for the 25th inst. and
could not come.
As a preliminary to the main event,
Greggains is trying to sign Sam Berger
and Jim Casey. It is understood Ber
ger has been clamoring for a chance
to redeem himself and the promoter
of the. San Francisco Club Is doing his
best to accommodate him. Casey was
on hand Jast night with $500 to bet on
himself, put all efforts to locate Ber
ger proved futile and the quest was
given up for the time being.
Sam McClintic, who is managing Hy
iand, insists that the weight be 122
pounds at 6 o'clock, while Neil will
hear nothing but 122 pounds ringside.
They wrangled and argued last night
for many hours over this point and
neither would concede a bit. It is more
than likely Neil will win out, for he is
the drawing card and therefore the
one who is most likely to do the dic
tating.
A little side play in which Casey and
Jack Johnson figured created quite a
ripple of fun while it lasted. Casey
was sitting in one corner of the room
and Johnson in another. Casey leaned
over to a friend and with inflated chest
remarked: "I would like to go on wid
that black man." Thi3 bit of informa
tion was quickly conveyed to Mr. John
son, who immediately struck a pictur
esque pose and in his gentle way said,
"Wal. yo just clean out dat backvroom
and Aw will fight Mistah Casey for foh
dollahs. Aw am in dls business for de
money and Aw don't care whether It
am big or little."
The match could not be arranged last
night as the janitor was not present,
so the stars had to content themselves
with casting a few ferocious glances
at each other from their strongholds.
WOULD HOLD MORRIS LEVY
RESPONSIBLE FOR DEBT
Judgment Creditor Seeks to Recover
Money Voluntarily Given to Buz
ayel, the Colored Wrestler.
Morris Levy, manager of the Hayes
Valh y Athletic Club, was up before
Justice of the Peace Daniels yesterday
on an order of examination. The order
is the result of a judgment of $80 ob
tained by E. J. Lapachet against' Vi
ctor Ajax, sometimes known as John
Batta and who as Buzayel wrestled with
Jenkins recently. Lapachet's process
server was present when Levy handed
Buzayel $100. As Levy was about to
give the colored wrestler another $80
the writ of garnishment is alleged to
have been served. Levy testified that
Buzayel had fouled his opponent and
on that account no money was coming
to him, he having forfeited his rights
in the case. Levy said he had present
ed Buzayel with $100 as a voluntary
gift and would have given him $80
more under the same condition had the
process server not intervened. Judge
Daniels said he could do nothing un
der the code and advised that a new
civil action against the Hayes Valley
Club was the only way to settle the
dispute.

TWO JOCKEYS
ARE SUSPENDED
Steeplechase Eiders Are
Punished by the Judges
at the Ascot Meeting
COMEDY IS ENACTED
Pilots Fall Off, Horses Bun
Out of the Course and
Other Incidents Happen
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 6.âThere were
: several events of interest to race goers
[ tc-day at Ascot. The first race pro-
I duced the sensation of the day. It waa
' a steeplechase, and as a result of the
race two jockeys were indefinitely sus
.pended and the race was given to the
horse that finished actually third. Jim
Lozeman finished first, but was disquu 1i -
fled for running out of the course. His
j jockey, McÃride, was indefinitely sus
j pended for not returning and covering
I the course when ordered to do so. Flea
appeared to be the- winner at the last
| jump, when his jockey, Amos, fell off.
j The judges decided that Amos deliber
j ately fell eff and suspended him in
' definitely. Cazador and Ed Lanlgan
j both ran out of course, but their rid
ers turned around, came back, covered
l the course and eventually were given
first and second money. Valido fell,
throwing his jockey. A stable boy
mounted him and rode him into third
place.
Favorites had a bad day of it. In the
two-year-old race Father Catcham won
in easy style from Wee Girl and
Dorothea Frye. Lady Walker, the red
hc-t favorite, was nowhere. Bologna
was a favorite for the fourth race. She
was practically left at the post and the
race fell to Pacifico at 10 to 1, Evea G
second and Ralph Young third. Blissful
won the fifth race, a selling event, and
was run up $400 above her entered
price, but was retained by her owner
for $1405. Tim Hurst was also run up
after winning the last race and went
to James Blute for $1600. There seems...
to be a selling race war among the j
owners. Bonsack has had his horses Â»
run up several times recently. Weather
cloudy, track fast. Summary:

William J. Dingee, president of ths â¢

yesterday ordered by Judge Lawlor to
show cause, on January 16, why he
should not be adjudged guilty of con
tempt for disobeying an order of court
for the taking of his deposition In th* -
suits brought by Jeanne D. Centsr.
The order of yesterday was issued
upon Mrs. Center's affidavit In which'

dence was material in the trial of her
big suits for damages against the Conrj
tra Costa Water Company. She sets
forth that Dingee was subpenaed to .

LIBRARY OF RARE MUSICAL
WORKS LEFT BY THOMAS
CHICAGO, Jan. 6.âThe announce
ment of a public bequest of Theodore
Thomas' unique musical libraryâa rare
collection of scores and manuscripts
from the famous masters âis to be
made within a month. During his en
tire career, the leader collected scores
and manuscripts, many of which were
presented to him by the authors. The
library is valued at 2300,000. Every
year he added to it, with the result
that it is the most valuable and ex
tensive private collection of its kind
in America.
Some of the original scores of Wag
ner, Liszt and other composers, it is
said, will be presented to the public
library.
The Chicago Orchestra, although the
formal announcement of the disposal
of the gift is withheld until a later
season, probably will receive the bulk
of the bequest.
The funeral of Theodore Thomas took
place in St. James Episcopal Church
to-day with simple rites. The Chicago
Orchestra attended as an organization
at the church and afterward formed
part of the cortege to the receiving
vault at Graceland Cemetery, where
the body will be kept until forwarded
for interment to New York.

VAINLY TRIES
TO END LIFE
Drink Crazed Man Leaps
Twice From High Building
and Escapes Without Hurts
DAZED BUT UNIXJUKED
Inebriate Wanders About
the Streets After Attempts
at Suicide Prove Futile
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Jan. 6.âFollowing a pro
j tracted spree James Carruthers this
morning decided to commit suicide.
Mounting to the top of a four-story
building occupied by the California
laundry, Carruthers removed his coat
and hat and stepped off. He expected
to land on the pavement, four stories
below, with bones broken and body
. shattered, but he had leaped from the
! wrong side of the building. He landed
|on the roof of a saloon only one story
i below.
! This preliminary dash jarred him
j considerably, but he was still deter
! mined to throw himself to destruction,
j and again he leaped from the roof,
i This time he landed astride of two elec-
I trie light wires, which he caught with
! arms and legs, thus preventing himself
j from falling thirty feet below to the
! cement sidewalk.
Fear of electric currents caused Car-
I ruthers to scramble upon a projecting
cornice, from which he leaped to the
| porch of a saloon and from there to the
â  ground. After reaching terra flrma
! without hat, coat or â vsast, Carruthers
i started wandering about the streets ap-
J parently but otherwise untn
! jured by his several leaps toward
j death.
ARCHIBISHOP ANSWERS
AMERICAN CHURCH PEOPLE
Objection to the Educational Tax, He
Says, Is Not Understood
Over Here.
LONDON, Jan. 6.âThe Archbishop
of Canterbury, replying to a memorial
from the Baptists and Presbyterians of
America, asking his assistance to pre
vent the hardships suffered by non
conformists of Great Britain, who ob
ject conscientiously to the payment of
the educational tax. incloses a copy of
a previous reply on the same subject
to a memorial from the Baptist con
vention in New York.
This reply contrasts the Bishop of
Canterbury's difficulty of understand
ing the present situation in connection
with the presidential election in Amer
ica with the difficulty the American
citizen might experience in under
standing the complex educational
problems of Great Britain and main
tains that the act under which the
tax is levied does not interfere in the
smallest degree with religious liberty
and that the whole tendency of the
bill is to remove so called non-con
formist differences. He says the
present controversy in Great Britain
would be found to "have other origin
and interests than those purely edu
cational."
The Archbishop in a letter inclosing
the reply says it has afforded him
great pleasure to help cement the
friendship, which he hopes will con
tinue, between members of the Church
of England and their Christian breth
ren of America, and continues:
"You may rely on my doing every
thing in my power, not only in Eng
land, but throughout the world, to re
move any mischievous causes of mis
understanding among Christian peo
ple."
WOULD PUNISH FATHERS
WHO DESERT FAMILIES
Bill Providing a Ceil for Cruel Parents
to Be Inrtdouced in â¢
Washington.
TACOMA, Jan. 6.âPolice Justice Wil
liams of Bellingham is framing a bill
which will go before the next Legisla
ture with the support of a majority of
the Superior Court Judges and Police
Justices of this State. It aims to pre
vent the wholesale desertion of their
families by men who sometimes find
it easier to run away and support
themselves instead of properly caring
for their wives and children. The bill
will provide for the punishment by im
prisonment or fine, or both, of hus
bands or wives who desert or abandon
their families.

The New York wires of E. F. Hutton A Co.
yesterday said:
C< TTONâThe Journal of Commerce this
. morning prints an interview with a prominent
official of one of the large cotton companies.
He gives his views on the cotton situation.
They are diametrically opposite to the opinions
f-Xpressed yesterday by W. C. Lovering, and
-he cotton oil authority maintains that as a
result of the sale of 7,000,000 bales on a 10c
basis the farmers are in a position to take
care of the surplus amount ot cotton and that
' spinners, having bought largely at the higher
â¢level, will be more disposed to support t!i<Â»
market than to work against It.
We have received a private dispatch from

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Jar. 6.âGathering disappoint
ment in view of the moderate investment de
mand for stocks and over the reluctance of
the outside public to come into the market
caused a general decline in prices to-day. Tha
growing sluggishness of the market and the
difficulty of getting prices up has proved irk
some all the week to the room-trade element,
. whose livelihood is dependent on motion in
the market of one kind or another. The
obstacles to the advance prompted a consid
erable proportion of this element to sell stocks.
' It did not appear there was any great amount
<5f liquidation in the movement and there waa
no new development to prompt a seHlng of
securities. Doubt over the level to which
prices have been lifted and over their stability
at that level may have prompted some selling
The movement was not widely different from
â¢ that on preceding days except that there was
a lack of such sustaining points In the market
as had been used up to to-day. With the
r. exception of a momentary' advance in Amalga
mated Copper and some continued absorption
t>f the Briea and Reading there was no strong
feature at any time to-day. The rise in
' Amalgamated Copper was connected with dis
cussion of its dividend prospects. As to the
effects of the decline It became fairly general
â¢ in the course of the day, thus indicating a
profit-taking character for the movement. The
news of the day did not change from the
recent favorable tenor as affecting property
values. Some effect may have been produced
' by the report of the definite determination to
appeal the Northern Securities decision, whioh
caused a drop in that stock on the curb. But
Its subsequent rally did not help the stock
â¢market. Railroads reporting earnings made
no deviation from the recent advancing ten
dency. In the cotton market the decline in
prices was reported to be attracting at least
large buying orders from foreign spinners and
the week's exports of corn were regarded as
â¢ highly gratifying. The shipments of the lat
ter cereal for the week rose to the largest for
any week in a long time. This revival in
the corn movement Is of special Importance on
account of the languid outward movement of
wheat and promises an effective supply In
the foreign exchange market. That market
'' continued to advance to-day and Inquiries by
foreign bankers showed that there is no abate
ment in the prospects for the outward move
' ment of gold. It is evident, however, that
th'! movement of currency has turned in full
tide from the interior to New York, the pre
liminary figures Indicating a gain by the banks
of more than $6,000,000. There is a feeling
growing up that a large accumulation of re
serves at thla center is now awaited aa an
. â¢ effective opportunity for the offering of large
new issues of securities. The fall in prices
gained its greatest velocity in the final hour
' and overran Itself resulting in an active de
mand to cover shorts by the room-traders.
â¢ The closing was irregular.
The bond market was strong, but the move
ment continued irregular. Total sales, pa*
. value, $6,326.080.
United States bonds were all unchanged on
the last call.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Jan. 6.âNotwithstanding in
creased shipments from Argentina, the wheat
market here opened with a fair degree of
firmness, May being up %Â©%c at $1 14%Â©
1 14%. The strengthening feature was the
continued light movement in the Northwest.
Although a comparison of receipts to-day with
those of the corresponding day a year ago did
not show a sufficient decrease to create bull
ishness, the figures were enough to keep alive
some hope in the bull traders. Business, how
ever, wss much restricted during ths early
part of the session, pit traders being bearlshly
inclined and waiting to avail themselves of a
possible slump. Weakness of coarse grains
brought out some profit-taking in wheat by
local longs Offerings were not readily taken
and in consequence prices eased off a trifle.
May declining to $1 14%. Later in the day a
firmer tone developed, mainly as a result ot
reports of Improved demand for cash wheat
at all the principal center* A factor that
helped to Increase bullish sentiment was Brad
street's report showing exports of wheat and
flour of 1,412,000 bushels for the week.
The high folnt on May for ths day was
reached at fSIS%. The market closed strong
with May af $1 15.
Early in tie session .he corn market exhib
ited much weakness, being subjected to re
newed selling by several commission houses
May opened unchanged to a shade higher at
44% c to 44%Â©44% c.
General liquidation, combined with soma
short selling, caused an early break of %c in
the oat market, but nearly all ths loss was
subsequently regained by short covering. May
closed at 30%Â©30% c.
At the start weakness of coarse grains had
a depressing effect on the provision market.
Final quotations on May pork were up 12%Â©
15c, lard was up 10c and ribs were 2%060
higher.

higher. The Modern Miller aayn that satis

ing the condition of the winter Wheat crop.
Advices indicate that the top growth is small
but healthy and the root growth is vigorous
and of an unusual length. Weather has been
quite favorable since winter set in and the
setback received hy the plant earlier in the
season on account of lack of moisture has been
fully recovered.
In this market futures were higher, but the

Family Retail Market,
Fresh Ranch Eggs are cheaper and they will
probably be even lower before long, as this is
the time of the year when the production in
creases and prices have a downward tendency.
Butter is more plentiful in the wholesale mar
ket, but retail rates have not been affected
as yet.
Fruits have changed but little since last
week and there are plenty of Apples and Or
anges to be had. The markets are slenderly
supplied with garden vegetables and several
kinds are higher. %

LIVELY FIGHT
AT A BREWERY
Attorney Joseph F. Coffey
Claims He Was Choked and
Beaten by Father and Son
GETS NOTES FROM BOOK
H. D. Ulrichs and Martin Ul
richs Arrested for an As
sault With Deadly Weapon
Attorney Joseph F. Coffey had an ex
citing experience in the office of the
Columbia Brewing Company at 326
Clementina street yesterday afternoon.
As a result he had H. D. Ulrichs, the
president and general manager, and
Martin Ulrichs, his son, arrested on a
charge of assault with a deadly
weapon. They were booked at the City
Prison and each released on $25 cash
bail fixed by Police Judge Cabaniss.
Coffey is a stockholder in the com
pany and is also attorney for August
F. Meyer, another stockholder, who
had President Ulrichs arrested on
Wednesday for assault and refusing
to show the cash book to a stockholder
of the company. The cases are pend
ing before, Police Judge Fritz.
Coffey called at the offlce yesterday
afternoon and asked permission to ex
. amine the books. No objection was
offered and he took a memorandum of
" data that he thought would be useful
to him.
In telling his story of what occurred
afterward Coffey said: "Young Ul
richs asked me what I had written
down. I told him that was my busi
â¢ ness. He demanded the paper which I
held in my hand and when I refused
he seized me by the throat and forced
me into a corner. The father grabbed
hold of a club and struck 'me on the
arm with it. Young Ulrichs continued
to choke me and asked his father if he
had got the paper. He said he had not.
Young Ulrichs released his hold of me
and I managed to shove the paper
Into my trousers pocket.
"I was again seized by the throat by
young Ulrichs and thrown over a light
ed stove. I was nearly all out when
I was again released. I told them I
would keep the paper and the old man
ran out of the offlce, saying he would
get a policeman and have me arrested.
The young man, who is six feet tall and |
"weighs about 180 pounds, locked the j
offlce door to keep me in. I called up
Captain Spillane and asked him to send
a policeman at once. The officer came
.and I had the father and son arrested.
The stockholders are not satisfied with
â¢ the way the brewery is being managed
by the father and son and we are de
. termined to get at the facts."
Ulrichs and his son said they merely
tried to put Coffey out and there was a
little scuffle. They are represented by
Attorney John Allen, who hinted dark
ly that Coffey would have to keep his
hands off.

STEALS A GOLD WATCH AND CHAIN.â
Miss E. Talbot, 310 A Clement street, reported
to the police yesterday that during her ab
sence on Thursday her house had been en
tered and a gold watch and long chain, valued
at $40. were stolen from a bureau drawer. En
trance had been effected by opening the front j
door with a false key.

SIDEWALK ORATOR DECLARES
HIS LANGUAGE WAS
NOT UNLAWFUL.
Policeman Thinks Otherwise
Bat the Words Did Not Aeooy as
Did the Maeaifer of Delivery.
Adolf Alfonso, youthful of appear
ance and earnest of manner, denied
that he was advocating anarchy when
Patrolman Nelson plucked him from
the midst of an approving auditory on
Clay street, between Montgomery and
Kearny. He deplored the apparent in
ability of a uniformed Incarnation of
the law to discern as between the ten
ets of the red flag cult and the doc
trines of the less belligerent creed of
socialism. 'Twas true, as specified in
the formal complaint accusing him of
peace disturbance, that he had ad
dressed a concourse of willing listeners
on a public thoroughfare, but he de
fied the man who arrested him to prove
that his preachments were of an Incen
diary character.
Then the policeman averred that it
was less what Mr. Alfonso had said
I than his manner of saying It and his
| obstruction of the sidewalk that pro-
I yoked the arrest. He (the officer) would
j confess that he was not profoundly
versed in the principles of either an
; archy or socialismâmuch less so In the
| fine distinctions that divide those
j schools of discontent. His duty of dis
i ciplining the "wine bums" that infest
l his beatâof which element Mr. Alfon
so's audience was largely composedâ
prevented his study of such abstract
questions. Perhaps If Mr. Alfonso were
a policeman assigned to regulate the
"wine joints" and their habitues he
might have less time to devote to ora
tory and the absorption of food there
for. What the officer did hear Mr. Al
fonso say was denunciatory of 'almost
| everybody and everything connected
j with the governmental institutions of
â  this country, fncludlng the Army and
navy, the courts and the police. He
had said that If less money were spent
in the maintenance of soldiers and sall-
I ors and Judges and "cops" there would
be more money spent on the malnten
i ance of the people, and the necessity
lof "slaving" for a livelihood would be
j correspondingly lessened. His utter
! ances were heartily applauded by men
I who to the officer's certain knowledge
I for many years had not earned a Hve
! lihood, but begged, borrowed or stole
I all they ate, drank or wore. The pollce
i man felt that any doctrine approved by
j such persons could not be promotive of
: society's best Interests.
Mr. Alfonso acknowledged that he
i had no regular employment, also that
he had spent much time in the perusal
of literature and In the listening to dis
courses concordant with the views he
expressed when Patrolman Nelson
scooped him In. His oratorical gift,
| Mr. Alfonso added, was Inherent, and
i its development had not been handi
j capped by his acquirement of a thor
i ough education in either political econ
! omy or the science of government.
Judge Cabanlss then ruled that In

what the prosecution had testified there
was no proof that the defendant had
advocated real anarchy, which means
destruction of both life and property in
the attainment of its impractical ends.
So the orator was dismissed and ad
vised to shift his forum from Patrol
man Nelson's beat.

Joseph Smith was held without bail
to answer in the Superior Court the
charge of having murdered Joseph Mc-
Gowan. His attorneys' motion that
bail be allowed was declined by Judge
Mogan, who remarked that the testi
mony showed Smith was the aggressor
throughout and that his killing of Mc-
Gowan was "cold-blooded assassina
tion." Tbe aged defendant displayed ho
feeling whatever while the magistrate
was speaking, but sat at the attorneys'
table and calmly brushed dust specks
from the lapels of his coat.
* â¢ â¢
In the department graced by Judge
Mogan's presidency the 300 block of
Prospect avenue made its first Police
Court appearance this year. During
the preceding twelvemonth It figured
several times before each of the four
magistrates, and the testimony heard
yesterday afforded warrant for a pre
diction that Its best previous record
will be eclipsed during the twelvemonth
to come. The feud that Involves almost
every resident of the block seems to ac
quire strength with age.
Miss Pearl Caflish is the complain
ant this time. It is her fourth ap
pearance In that role, and she has also
posed two or three times as a defend
ant. Her age is 16, but she has had
enough Police Court experience to sat
isfy an octogenarian lover of that
game. Bailiff Hlckey thinks she is al
ready enslaved by the habit. The per
son accused by* her is Charles Sink, a
commercial tourist who owns a dog,
and It was for "sicking" the animal at
her that Miss Caflish haled him into
court. <
"He done it last New Tear's day,"
Miss Caflish testified. "I was attendln'
to me own business, an' not sayln'
nothln' to nobody, when he sicked the
Jog at me."
It was only her superior agility. Miss
Caflish added, that saved her from
being bitten by the pursuing canine,
svhich had been angered to frenzy by
ts master's voice. She opined, fur
thermore, that the attack was a de
velopment of a conspiracy having for
* j.:
its object her removal from the block.
In other words, Mr. Sink was not act
ing entirely on his own Initiative when
he encouraged the dog to chase and
bite her.
Judge Mogan continued the case till
January 25, and wearily expressed a
hope that the interim might establish
something remotely akin to harmony
on the 300 block of Prospect avenue.

TO BREAK JAIL
While Awaiting Extradition
on Grand Larceny Charge
A. A. Kratz Gets Desperate
OREGON BOOT IS SENT
Detective T. B. Gibson Is Ex
pected to Arrive To-Day
With Him From Mexico
Detective T. B. Gibson is expected to
arrive to-day from Mexico with A. A.
Kratz, who is to -be tried in Judge
Dunne's court on a charge of grand
larceny. Kratz's brother, William, was
j vice president of the Donandt-Kratz
i Company, and on February 13, 1903,
disappeared, taking with him over
$16,000 belonging to the company which
he had collected. A. A. Krktz was with
him at the office when he |eft with the
coin. William was arrested in Kansas
City. He was brought back, tried,
convicted and sentenced to serve five
years in San Quentin.
A. A. Kratz was arrested in this city.
He was out on $10,000 bonds and his
trial had been definitely set for Sep
. tember 17 last. When the case was
j called on that date it was reported that
i Kratz had been drowned while bathing
at Long Beach about a week before.
Affidavits were filed with the court
| from employes at the bathing estab
lishment and others, but doubts were
expressed and Judge Dunne forfeited
Kratz's bonds and issued a bench war
rant for his arrest.
i About a month later Kratz was ar
rested at Ronquillo, Sonora, Mexico,
and on October 28 Gibson left with the
papers for his extradition. Kratz
fought his extradition, mit on Decem
! ber 30 a dispatch was received from
Gibson that he would leave on Janu
ary 4 with his prisoner. In his dis- \
patch he said that Kratz, becoming
desperate, had attacked the guard at
the jail at Ronquillo and had attempted
to make his escape. Gibson suggested
that an "Oregon boot" be forwarded to
him, as he felt convinced that Kratz
would attempt to escape. It was sent
that evening.
The case was called In Judge Dunne's
court on December 30 for trial and by
consent was continued till January 13.

spring at reasonable intervals. As he '
Mas a kind father, regardless of what
he had been in the role of husband,
his visits to the youngsters were fre
quent and their mother's treatment
of him on such occasions was courte
ous, to say the very letu?t. Gradually
it dawned upon him that the divorce
was a blunder and when he hinted as
much to the lady she artlessly re
frained from expressing an opinion on
the subject, but her manner conveyed
to him the impression that her
thought was acquiescent. When he
proposed remarriage, however, she
asked for and was granted time for
deliberation, explaining that she did
not desire to make another mistake.
Commending her prudence, he sys
tematically began a course of court
ship to prove that he was worthy of a
second acceptance. She gave no dis
couraging sign. That his renewed
wooing was unwelcome he had no rea
son to believe. That it was less warm
ly reciprocated than may have been
his due he ascribed to the lady's in
nate sense of coyness and he liked her i
all the better for it.
Assured that the goal of his devo
tion was as good as won, Mr. Farmer
went to spend New Year's eve with
lQr progeny and their mamma, and
when he rang the doorbell of 503
Golden Gate avenue there waa not- in I
all the city a heart lighter than his.
His ring was responded to by his
young daughter and to his great aston
ishment and grief she informed him |
that perhaps he had better go way, as j
his presence in the house might have
a wet blanket effect on the festivities
therein, the inspiring cause of which !
was not exactly the death or birth of
a year, but the marriage of her ]
mamma to G. W. Stout, an esteemed
peddler, which had taken place that ;
very day. When the initial shock of
surprise departed from the mind of j
Mr. Farmer it left there a deep-seated j
anger, which found vent in language j
bo loud and offensive that Mr. Stout !
emerged and effected his arrest for j
disturbing the peace.
Judge Cabaniss continued the hear- j
Ing one month and to Mr. Farmer ,
hinted as to the inutility of shedding
tears over spilt milk, supplemented j
with a reminder that in the sea there i
ire as good fish as ever have been taken j
from it, followed by several other wise j
saws and modern instances of femi
nine fickleness. Mr. Farmer, who is a j
carpenter by trade, absorbed the phll
jsophy. and went his way.

MAYOR DELAYS
APPOINTMENTS
His Failure to Announce
Selections Due to Fight
Over Police Commissioner
CANDIDATES NUMEROUS
Schmitz May Resign From'
Works Board to Get Long
Term for the Same Office
Mayor Schmitz did not officially an
nounce the names of the new mem
bers of the various municipal boards
and commissions yesterday afternoon,
as he said he would. The Mayor's de
lay was caused by the struggle which
is on for the Police Commlssionership.
He would like to give the place to
John O'Brien, a relative by marriage,
and a warm personal friend. Abe
Ruef Is standing behind Dr. Joseph
Pohelm, present member of the Health
Board, while Dr. George Drucker is
backed by heavy influences though
not by the "Horses and Carts" as in
advertently stated in these columns.
Golden M. Roy, a Kearny street optic
ian, has developed formidable politi
cal strength and the wise ones are
looking on him to secure the plum.
Thomas F. Egan yesterday filed
with the Mayor his official bonds for
the office of Commissioner of Public
Works, he having been given instruc
tions to that effect. This confirms his
appointment to the post as predicted
by The Call for some time past. Egan
furnished four personal sureties for
$25,000 In view of the notice of a
surety company that it desires to
withdraw from the bonds of Commis
sioners Schmitz and Maestretti be
cause it considers the risk too great
owing to a Superior Court decision
that the commissioners are individual
ly responsible for accidents from de
fective streets and sidewalks.
The latest rumor is that David J.
Oliver Jr. will be appointed Park
Commissioner temporarily pending the
prospective resignation of Civil Ser
vice Commissioner Rogers, who will
probably go to Washington with Con
gressman-elect Hayes next March. In
that event Oliver will be Rogers* sue- j
cessor. The gossips are figuring that i
Oliver is being seriously considered
for Police Commissioner and there I
may be some grounds for this sur
mise. William H. Metson is a strong
candidate for Park Commissioner.
Many rumors were rife yesterday,
one being that Herbert Schmitz would
resign as Commissioner of Works to i
make way for School Director Boyle.
Bchmtts himself denied that such was

WANTS CARS EQUIPPED
WITH LIFTING JACKS
Stephen Byrne Petitions Supervisors
to Compel Street Railroads to In
stall Devices for Accidents.
Stephen Byrne yesterday petitioned
I the Supervisors to compel street rail
road companies to equip their cars
with lifting jacks. Byrne said he wit
nessed an accident where the victim,
a little boy, was compelled to remain
! under the car thirty minutes until
lifting jacks were borrowed from a
I near-by machine shop. Again Byrne
says that on Monday last a 3-year-old
child was killed on Mission street near
Twenty-third and the frantic parents
were compelled to stand by for half
an hour until lifting jacks could be
brought from the car house at Twen
ty-ninth street. Byrne says that these
sights impel him for the cause of hu
manity to request that some action be
i taken.
