CHICAGO, May ILâ There were
many evidences to-day that the strike
is on its last legs. The flour embargo
Is to be raised by union drivers to
morrow and drivers for hay and feed
Btabfes ignored the orders of . their
chiefs .and continued to deliver to the
â¢"etruck houses" to-day. The express
companies are already taking back
some of their old union drivers who
â¢were not in ssTnpathy with the strike
and who were forced out by their lead
ers. The greatest number of teams
cent out since the strike began was in
service to-day and there was little mo
lestation.
The word was triumphantly passed
along the union picket line to-day that
Prank Curry, the hated strike-breaker,
had been "put out of business."
"It's six months in a - hospital : for
Curry." was the cheerful news , that
traveled rapidly through labor, circles.
The report could not be verified. . \u25a0
Labor men say Curry was luredt into
en alley back cf his hotel â¢ iast night
and "trimmed" with "'brass knuckles.";
Officials -on thÂ£ Employers'. T. Teaming
Company cay Curry is in St. Louis. . (
The most important part of the strike
developments was the examination A of
â¢witnesses this . afternoon before Mas
ter in Chancery Sherman., who is tak
ing testimony relative to the alleged
violation of .the Federal injunctions
granted for the Employers' Associa
tion and for the seven express com
panies.
Adolph Pheil, for eleven years an em
ploye of" the United States Express
Company, but not a striker, refused
to answer questions on the ground that
he might incriminate himself. The
Federal Court will be asked to decide
as to whether or not he must answer.
John Bernard, a union teamster.' was
chot in the hand and thigh to-night by
Â«, a colored man employed as a driver at
the store where Bernard was employed
before the strike. . Since the commence
ment of the trouble Bernard has been
a picket around the place, and when
several of the negroes who now drive
wagons for the department store met
Bernard and some of his friends \u25a0 to
night they offered to fight the latter.
The invitation was declined and one of
the colored men. drawing a revolver,
' tired at Bernard. -He was taken to the
hospital, where his condition is said to
be serious. His assailant escaped.;
Cabmen to-day added a new annoy
ance to the list of discomforts suffered
by women as a result of the strike.
While torrents of ra,in deluged the
6trcets. women passengers, in order to
reach the larger retail stores, were
forced to leave hired conveyances, in
come cases a block away, pickets warn
ing all union drivers not to approach
the carriage entrance.
It was announced yesterday that J.
W. "Wilson of Sacramento had notified
the authorities .of that city of his de
sire to withdraw as a surety on the
bond of ex-State Senator Frank French,
who is under indictment -for "accepting
a bribe. Immediately on the receipt of
the information District -Attorney Sey
mour of- Sacramento and. a deputy
sheriff started .for this city, presumably
for the purpose of taking French into
custody and conveying him back to
Sacramento.
According to report, Bondsman Wil
son recently ' learned ; that French - was
negotiating for, the disposal of his
property, in this city, and when . the
disgraced ex-State official was taken to
task about the report, he is said . to
have informed Wilson that the, trans
actions were simply of a'\u25a0 business
1 nature. -Wilson, however, pursued his !
inquiries 'further and satisfied himself
that his own interests would . be best j
served by 1 withdrawing from French's
bond.-'; . - ,:\u25a0\u25a0:. ,;.',â¢-.â¢> \u0084>* j .:-:' .\ : , â¢
-French's ; other, bondsman ;is ..Edward
ShorjLpf this ;city, . who \is assistant ser.-,
"geant of arms ; of : the ; Senate?'^ When
informed jof the .withdrawal of i Wilson
from the bond ,; he i remarked , that r =^he
had had, no intention of withdrawing,
but. he added: i
"Well, if Wilsom has: withdrawn .that
means that French's :"bond is , invalidat
ed and he ' will have <to get . two t. new
bondsmen. As yet I, have not been in
formed of Wilson's intentions."-
Inquiry at French's home on Dun
can street several times last night
brought the response that he was out
and he had not returned at a'; late
hour.. Upon his arrival here'.,last.even
; ing : District Attorney Seymour of Sac
1 ramento did not regisjter at the Grand
i Hotel, as is his regular custom, v and
the failure to locate him at any of the
other hotels, * coupled with French's
strange absence from his home,; gave
rise to the suspicion among the friends
of, the ; ex-Senator, who :had learned
of Bondsman- Wilson's withdrawal,
that Seymour and the . deputy; sheriff
that accompanied him to San .Fran
cisco had French secreted somewhere/
awaiting the departure ;of a morning
train to ;_ Sacramento. :

Ward was arrested here :, two years !
ago for swindling, a Pasadena man out â¢
of a large sum, and was sentenced, to â¢
ten years in San Quentin, but the Su- 1
preme Court gave him a new trial. The
prosecuting witness had j returned East
and- the case had to. be dropped. At.
that time he had a wife, a daughter of ;
wealthy and respectable parents at j
Trbpico,' who had inherited a snug for
tune from her grandfather. >-
Recently Ward was arrested in" San
Diego, and ' a Los. Angeles; officer who
was visiting there saw him in jail. :A
woman whom he j had married there
was: visiting him. and the officer hap- j
pened to 'remember the wife; he had j
here. An investigation was made, with ;
the result that it was discovered that â¢
Ward has one wife here, another in 1
San Diego, a third in Seattle and' two i
more in Denver. All these women had j
money, and Ward seems to have made 1
away with all of it.
LOS ANGELES,' May 11.â M. T.
Ward, who has a bad \ police record as
a hunko "operator and j who is in jail jin
San Diego charged with" being" impli
cated in a swindling: game which is
said to have netted him several thou
sand dollars, promises to j be' identifled
as a / Calif ornia ' duplicate of ' Hoch, the
Chicago man with iCumerous v wives, ex
cept that he is not yet charged with
having killed any of them.
From official sources it is learned
thaf peace between Japan and Russia
waa nearly concluded when the unex
pected appearance of the Russian.sec
ond Pacific squadron in-China Sea're
vived Russia's hopes.

TOICIO, May 11.â No"* one here- has
any doubt that peace is coming through
President'^Roosevelt's offices. He ' has
ascertained that Russia desires to end
the war, . and the St. Petersburg Gov- .
ernment has acquainted him with the
fact, that it hopes Japan will dispense'
with indemnity,. 60 as. to ; enable Russia
to save her face. Cession "of territory
Is regarded as merely a loss to China
and not actually to Russia. Much is
hoped for from secret negotiations and
secret clauses to the peace treaty.
Meanwhile the Foreign Ministry at
Toklo is informed that President Roose
velt has ascertained the terms that
would be agreeable to the neutral pow

markable tidal wave along the; west
short of Lake Michigan were received
to-day. The , wave - seemed to be thÂ«.
highest at.Keriosha and Racine. \u25a0 Wls.;
where a- wall of water swept In. caus
ing much damage and alarm along the
docks. At Chicago the wave simply
' raised xihe stage of waters and -caused
j a very heavy , current down the draln
; age canal." - Boats navigated"; the river
! with the greatest difficulty as a result
of the current.
r Weather . conditions In.* Chicago this
afternoon-were such that a recurrence
of . tidal _ waves along the west , shore v
was anticipated. The . rain during the ;
last twelve,!hours has been almost ,un- ,
precedented. Within a few hours' the^
fire department . answered eighty calls"
to- pump out abasements in various
parts of the' city." \u25a0-..\u25a0\u25a0
The wave is attributed to the differ
ence in -barometric pressure at differ
ent V? points, producing a wave or;
"seiche." The pressure being relieved
at one point;' ' the ; water rushed - under â¢
as the result of pressure on. the surface
some : distance away. Severe thunder
storms are' expected to continue on , the
upper lakes. The weather, map to-day
closely resembled. that of May 26, . 1596,
when ; the destructive tornado at St. -

much damage.

Long existing friction betwen thej
laiT^r stockholders of.the Rfsdon.lron '
Works has finally resulted in the re- .
trrement from the big engineering con
cern of \'ice President and Superin
tendent R. S. Moore, \Vlao has been con
nect<vd with the company for more
than a quarter of a century. Here
eiicned his positions at a meeting held
last Monday. Although an effort has
been made to keep the matter quiet, it
v.as learned yesterday that a stormy
Ecen* preceded Mr. Moore's retirement,
%\hich \va.Â« the result of his di&ccvering
that thf Taylors, f-' her and sons, with
whom he had been associated for so
many years, had purchased. additional
stock in a sufficient quantity, to give
them absolute control of the corpora
tion.
Immediately following the resigna
tion of Vice President Moore, the Tay
lors elected to the superintendence of
the works Robert H. Postlethwaite,
â¢who had been connected with the
drsuÃhtine department of the company
Cor a numbf-r of years. It has been
common talk in business circles for
several months that friction existed
between Vice President Moore and the
sens of President Taylor. It is re
ported that Moore attempted to sup-,
plant Augustus Taylor as secretary '
with Louis R. Mead, the auditor of the
company, but failed. When the breach
between Moore and the Taylors had
widened to a degree where reconcilia
tion was Impossible, it is said that
Moore made a proposition to the presi
dent that one or the other sell his
'stock. President Taylor is said to have
refused to entertain either proposition
aÂ»id quietly went on the outside and
purchased the stock held in the name
of Frank Drum, thus securing a con
troling interest and thwarting the sus
pected plan of Vice President Moore to
gain control, which be could have ac
complished with the stock owned by
himself and other members of his fam
ily and that of several friends in the
company.
Learning of the move made by the
Taylors, the vice president went to
Monday's meeting fully prepared to
resign and he immediately carried out
his intentions when the meeting was
called to order. The news of \u25a0 his re
tirement, when it leaked out yesterday,
was an Important topic of conversa
tion in business sections and was re
sponsible for a Btory circulated- later
fn the day that another engineering
â¢works is bidding for Moore's services,
and that he is seriously considering a
proposition to launch forth in another
. shipbuilding enterprise.

Miss Mellon's attention was called

soon established order and -: got the

LINCOLN, Neb., May 11. â Because
she refused- to return his love, P. J.
Katheizer : to-day shot and killed
Grace Townsley and then shot him
self through the heart. '
Miss Townsley, whose home was in
Omaha, had recently joined the Vol
unteers of America, much against the
wishes of her mother, who declares
that the girl's mind was wholly taken
up with religious work and that she
cared nothing for the society of men.
She had assisted the Volunteers since
she was 14 years old. Last winter she
went home at her mother's earnest
solicitation, but on reaching the age
of 18 returned to Lincoln.
I The tragedy occurred on the steps
which led to Miss Townsley's room, in
the presence of Mrs. Hubbell, a cap
tain in the Volunteers of America.
Katheizer; followed his ;;victim e and
Mrs Hubbell from downtown, and as
they started up the. stairs, to their
room he began to fire. " Miss Towns
ley fell, two bullets . having passed
through her body near her heart.
Katheizer then ran to the alley and
sent a ball through his body. He died
a few moments later without having
made any statement.
Katheizer was a carpenter by trade
and for some time had been taking
part In the Volunteer Army song.ser
j vices, having been won over by Miss
\u25a0 Townsley, whose personal beauty is
said to have be, en responsible for the
making of many converts. He was 34
years old.
JILTED SUITOR
ENDS TWO LIVES
Foreman Andrews of the Grand
Jury believes that he has located the
place where the defaulting Tax Col
lector has cached part of the money
he stole from the city. Andrews left
last night ostensibly for Coronado but
really for Los Angeles, where he will
ask the police to help him find the
loot.
Search will be made of all the safe
deposit banks in the city. Foreman
Andrews is certain from the Informa
tion he has received that part of
Smith's stealings have been deposited
in that city.
When Andrews has placed his infor
mation in the hands of the Lots Ange
les police he will 'go on to meet the
defaulting Tax Collector to question
him regarding the alleged shortage of
5165,000.
Foreman Andrews is firm in the be
lief that a conspiracy existed behind
the story of the first shortage and
hopes to get a clew to it from Smith
himself. Andrews will probably meet
the train that is carrying the prisoner
at Barstow.
Foreman Andrews believes that if he
can talk to Smith before the defaulter
can see an attorney he may be able
to make him talk. It is on this chance
that he is making the trip. He believes
the evidence that has already been
turned up by the Grand Jury warrants
making a desperate attempt to induce
the defaulter to involve others.
Andrews insists that he is only go-
Ing on a pleasure trip, but it is known
that the energetic foreman would not
choose such a time for a pleasure trip.
He refuses to tell his destination or to
admit that he intends to see Smith.
Juryman E. J. Bowes will act as
foreman while Andrews is away. Bowes
has distinguished himself by his en
ergy in fighting the poolrooms and
brothels.

An address on "The Qraxing L*nds"
by Colonel John P. Irish of California
\u25a0was read at the session to-day. It was
as follows:
Neiiber repeal nor amendment of the land
liwa nor the extension of Irrigation by the
Federal Gorcraxntnt will Mive the problem of
thÂ« graxlEf '""*Â» After all irrigabie and til
lable land Is occupied there will remain about
400,000,000 acres of penile domain, , tnostlr fit
lor livesKxJ* ranges and for nothing- else. It Is
a vaJcable asset, xrlth potential wealth. 'What
li to be done with It? Ttie Government has
not ret answered that Question, and the live
stock: interests bave not agreed upon what the
aarwer elioald be.
That domain is now ooenpied in oonmoD. It
U overstock Â«!. and as a result Its forage Is
be3ac destroyed and Its stock carrylnK capacity
la disappeartnc. Wben the soil 1Â» bared by
4eetractioD of the forare piasts and their per
manent aradlCKtloa. eroislon and tn^H^g in the
na brtns abost desert ccnililons, under
which râ >*i<JTÂ»g aad reaewal of pasture is dif
ficult. We all know of tbÂ» violeaoe, crime
&ad lon of Ufa and propertx that gt> with thÂ«
tncreastnc strife fcr what paster* is left. The
rasee is wlthoat law, and Its ooenpasey has no
proteetloo. except the \Nlachester.
Sacb a oontUXloD amounts to ' a national
"*- T "'-' 1 and a wantpa deftruction of a property
valaÂ« which it shoold be the business of the
Government to yjuJt-i kl. The facts are all
ksawn and are of record In the tepoit of the
lind coi&sdttÂ«Â« oi the House of Repregenta
trree of aa Inrestlgyriop which I procured. If
the raseÂ« Industry is to eurvlve these graitng
lacil â¢ cut be classified and their occupancy
leraZ!=sd by a leasehold.
The Government Is rpenfling- mllllans to pro-
Tlde irrigation far land to whioh aetxlers are
Invited. TTf all know that the pronts of irri
gation In all this lsterzaocntaln region are
t oraed by ralshss winter feed for livestock that
has ssmxaeT ranre. The sucimer range Is
mainly oa the gradas lands of the public do
xneis' that hare no other apparent use. As
the ftsr^sÂ« disappears the livestock disappears
also, and when the whole summer range Is de
etrored, a* evwj acre will hÂ« by the present
methods, there will be no stock to consume
the winter feed raised on the Irrigated lands.
It will be observed, therefore, f*iÂ«t the irriga
tion and raare leasing policies are tinited. The
success cf cne depends upon the adoption of
tse other.
Durins the discussion of this subject the
livestock men of the TVest have \m*n subjected
to much criticism and abuse and uojnst sus-.
pldon, all cndeserred. They were the pioneers
of this vast region, and 1f the Industry thÂ«y
founded, upon which all others hare Impinged.
In Its etruesle for exlsteaoe, has shows same
desperation, the fault Is with that Inertia in
tbÂ» Government which has refused to see that
lands are classified as forest. asrlooltural,
snlseral and rrarimr .each with its Individual
resources and capacity. If agriculture had
been made the victim of the hurts and*hin
drances that have co sorely smitten the Uve
rtock Industry, Its struggle for cxlstmce would
have been more xlolest than oars.
I by no means execse the livestock men for
their lack of harmony and their failure to
stand together \u25a0 and firmly . scmÂ»ort a move- I
rnent that would reach them all. put money in
the public treasury asd glvÂ« the West a
ralg-hty forward Impulse. But the time has
come when they can no longer stand apart.
The situation Is acute. - It Js drfvlnr our Jn-
Cnstry Into Onada and Mexico to find aase
and liberal laws for Its protection. lam per
ruaded that a united movement, with this
whole Imperiled Interest behind It. will result
in the classification of the grazing- lanAs and
their protection by a leasehold.
Resolutions \rere adopted thanking
President Roosevelt "for his fight for
equal rights to all at the hands of the
railroads**; declaring that the present
railroad law is inadequate "and should
be strengthened by giving to the Inter
state Commerce Commission power to
substitute Just, fair and reasonable
rates for those which it may find on
investigation to be nnjust or unrea
sonable"; condemning the private "car
line systems controlled by the packers;
asking for the repeal of laws requiring
unloading of livestock in transit; op
posing the tonnage system in transpor
tation of livestock and asking for a
minimum speed of twenty miles an
hour for stock trains; demanding
"that the Senate of the United States
shall cease obstructing the application
of that great principle, reciprocity.

EXPIjODES WTTH A ROAR.
The train carried a number of prom
inent persons, and most of them es
caped with only slight injuries. The
wrecked train was the second section ;
of the Cleveland and Cincinnati ex
press, which left Philadelphia at 11:05 i
Â«T clock last night. It consisted of a
combination bagrgape and smoking
car. one day coach and six sleepers.
About 1:40 o'clock the engine on the
eastbound freight train was flagged by
the crew r.f a switching engine ahead
on the same track. The engineer
quickly put on his air brakes, and the
train, an unusually long one, came to
c sudden etop. The strain on the air
valves was a severe one, and a con
necting air hose in the middle of the
train blew out. This caused the mid
dle of the train to "buckle," and the
damaged cars fell over on the passen
jrer tracks.
Just as this happened the Cleveland
express came thundering up and "side
Fwiped" the wreck. The express was
stopped within Its own length, and the
third sleeper was opposite the wrecked
car. Before any one could leave the
passenger train, which was not very
badly damaged, a few slight explo
sions occurred, and then there was one
great flash and roar that shook the
<?arth. The whole affair occurred
within a period of a few seconds.
KWELOPED IX FLAMES.
A scene of horror followed the ex
plosion of the dynamite. The passen
ger cars and some of the freight cars
instantly took fire. As the reverbera
tion of the terrific explosion died
away across the Susauehanna. River
the agonizing cries of the Injured;
could be heard. Men and women
came tumbling and climbing from' the !
car windows and crawled from under
the wreckage. Shortly afterward an
other explosion occurred. Fearing the
entire freight train might be loaded
with dynamite, no one dared go near
the wreck.
train, led the way and the uninjured
passengers followed. Scores of those
who were trapped in their sleeping
berths or pinioned under, wreckage
were taken out. The advancing . flre
drove the rescuers back as they were
about to take others from the wreck
and the unfortunates, men and wom
en, were soon enveloped in the flames.
The cries of the dying were heartrend
ing, but nothing could be done for
them. V ,
HOSPITAL CROWDED. â¢
An alarm of fire was sent in, but
when the firemen reached the scene
the flames had done their work. The
entire train was consumed. With the
I firemen came a corps of physicians
from the city. As qujpkly as the in
jured were temporarily, .relieved of
pain they were placed on special
trains and trolley cars and hurried to
the hospitals here. x
Very few of the passengers that es
caped had any clothing to speak . of.
Most of them had been in their berths
afc* the time of the explosion, and es
caped only In pajamas or other light
apparel.
"The first intimation I had of the
wreck," said John ,B. . Reynolds ' of
Pittsburg:, a newspaper man, who was
going home from New York and es
caped with slight injuries, "was when
I heard an awful crash and was
thrown, out into the aisle of the car.
1 was dazed for a little time; and only
realized my position and what had
happened when I felt a woman grab
bing me and screaming, "For God's
sake, help me" I pushed her out of
the window, and a fellow . passenger
handed out a child which belonged to
her. He then left the train and called
to . me to jump through the window.
Just thÂ«n there was a terrific explo
sion. As I dropped to the ground a
missile struck and \u25a0_ knocked me down.
I don't know how long I lay there, but
when I recovered my senses I crawled
across the tracks under a freight train
and rolled down the embankment on
the other side. I was in my night
clothes, and all my other clothing and
belongings were lost.
"I never want, to witness such; a
sight as that which followed the col
lision. Women were screaming, chil
dren were crying and strong men were
\u25a0 wandering about dazed and .helpless.
The traefcs were strewn in all direc
tions with half-naked men and women,
some of whom we're dead and others
seriously Injured." â¢ .-
The millhands working near the
scene of the accident were Quick to
respond to the cries of . the injured,
and carried ' some tof them to " their
homes in that locality. and fitted some
of them ouf with shoes and clothing.-.,
PROMINENT WOMEN" HURT.
The women in the wreck Buffered
greatly and many of those who escaped
were found almost- naked. Among
those who escaped with slight injuries
were Mrs. Albert -J.-Barr,- wife of the
proprietor of the Pittsburg Post, . and
her two daughters, who were on their
way to Pittsburg. \u25a0: They ; were taken
to the hospital, where one of the at
tending physicians I gave them atten
tion and sent them to his home. \u25a0 .
Mr. and Mrs. Tindell of Pittsburg, the
latter the daughter of United , States
Senator P. C. Knox, were slightly in
jured by falling glass. . They walked
from the scene of the wreck to Steel
ton, where they called ' up Governor
Pennypacker. by_ telephone and .ex
plained f their condition. /They were
brought to the executive ; mansion,
where they were furnished with cloth
ing and medical attention.
The lifeless body of Engineer Thomas
with the head "almost severed was
found lying over an embankment. ~ '
Albert J. Banr of the Pittsburg Post
arrived . this afternoon from Philadel
phia. Mrs. Barr and her daughter will
remain in Harrisburg. until to-morrow
night. Mr. | and Mrs. Tindell will stay
at the. executive .mansion until, this
evening, when they will resume their
Journey to Pittsburg. Aside from cuts
on her feet, caused: by walking; on the
railroad tracks -and ; injuries from j flying
glass, Mrs. Tindell .was . uninjured.
SHOCK DESTROYS HOUSES.
! Several small houses near the Lochiel
furnace were ., badly - shattered. The
force of the explosion upset a lamp In
the . residence of .T. -: P.. Martin of this
city, starting a \u25a0 flre that destroyed
three houses. . , . >. \u0084< .
Flying glaas and . articles which
were knocked from the walls struck
the Inmates as they lay in their beds
and a number of. minor, injuries were
reported. The shock and . effects ' of
the explosion were heard and felt for
many miles and panes of ; glass of
large windows â¢ were broken for - miles
around.
Henry Sllvennan, a New York Jew
elry salesman, : had a satchel, in .his
berth which' contained $17,000 worth
of. Jewelry. In order to escape being
burned to death he was compelled to
leave the satchel in the coach, which
was destroyed .by fire.' '* : 
- Among those who received slight
injuries was Miss Brown, daughter of
Congressman Brown of Pittsburg, and
her companion, 'Miss Wood worth ; of
Philadelphia: They escaped' through
a car window. The Rev. T.-H. Ache
son of Denver escaped unhurt.

BERKELEY, May 11.â With the close^
of the college year a , discussion has*
been. started that may bear fruit dur
ing the next term. From, within the
student "body has come the suggestion
that it would be weir to investigate
the oft-mentioned "college of journal
ism" scheme. This matter has . been
talked of much In the East, and to a
I greater extent in California than ever
, before during the last year. It has
been made. the, topic of several ad
dresses at different university meet
ings. The Daily -Californlan, in clos
ing its term of publication for the year,
takes up the matter in the following
article:
During the term a considerable number ot
the students of the university have discussed
the' subject of a college of Journalism In this
Institution. Columbia will place a chair of
Journalism In its university within a short
time, which has- already attained : much dis
tinction.
Among the. Â«tudentÂ» here there are quite i a
number of literary men and women, many of
whom have been pursuing or expect to follow
newspaper work. To these. It is claimed, such
a course would be of the greatest. benefit.
Objections have also been made that the in
Â«tkution \u25a0 of another chair in the university
would be unneceusary; that everything can
be obtained from the present â¢curriculum. The
essential studies for a Journalistic course, so
declare many of the faculty, are English, his
tory, economics and languages, including Ger
man and French. If such a course as pre
scribed should be taken it would be impos
sible to get a. degree. Such being the case,
the students are anxious to liave a course of
studies arranged in such a way aÂ« to cover'
the essential points of Journalism and 'literary
work,
â¢ J. C. Rowell. university librarian, when
asked his opinion of the proposed college of
Journalism, said that the subject was not â¢ a
new one, to him. It had first been proposed
at a university meeting In 1873 by Samuel
Wiliiams. then editor of the San Francisco
Bulletin. Mr. Williams' Â»nggeÂ»tion had been
favorably received . and officially approved by
President Glilman, but for some reason the
matter was never carried further. Bines then
it has been revived at Intervals until it was
given greater headway about a year ago at the
time of the foundation of the college of Jour-"
nalinm at Columbia University.
' At that time John McXaught, editor of the Pan
Francisco Call, spoka on the subject at a uni
versity meeting. He quoted Horace Greeiey'i fa
mous saying: "Of all the horned cattle in a
newspaper office, God save me from a college
graduate." but said that his experience had
tended to prove the opposite and declared that
a special college of Journalism would still more
increase the value of the college man In the
newspaper office. "The university and the
newspaper are the two' greatest expanders
In the, world. ThÂ« ' paper has been reared
amidst illiterate surroundings and has now be
come an untutored giant. The university has;
expanded to aueh an extent that cheese
making and the art of 'selling "canned goods ;
to people who do not want them are now re
garded ac sciences. The two things' . lacking*
in the curriculum are Journalism and dress
making," said Mr. McNaught. V ~*
Our library is the best equipped -In tha
world bo far as camples of all kinds of period
icals arÂ» concerned, and has also a -large col-" !
lection of books on Journalism and histories of.
the growth of:. the profession, as it la now
termed. ,"-.â¢-,. T s ; : " f.-'Z *'-.

BUILDING OPPOSITE MINT
COURT INCENSED
BY A LITIGANT
The legislative committee to report
a bill for a new. law to govern build
ing and loan associations in California
met in this city yesterday for - confer
ence.. The committee consists of A..M.
Drew, of FresnoJ J. P. Transue of Los
Angeles and P. S. King of Napa. Two
years will elapse before a report is
j made and there is no reason for haste.
Therefore the conunittee has not called
upon any one to furnish facts in this
city for use. When there is a <:all for
testimony there Is no doubt that many
parties will hasten to reply to the sum
mons, for the interest is naturally keen
in the bill to be framed and submitted
to the Legislature.
j This fact is made clear by the state
' ment that there are 125 active building
and loan associations in the State and
seven that are classed as co-operative.
Their assets at the end of 1904 amount
ed in the aggregate to $21,000,000. They
had a surplus of $500,000 in round fig
ures. Thousands of investors are mem
bers of the associations. The pockets
of many are concerned.
Assemblyman Transue said yesterday
that the committee had not definitely
decided on its procedure. He was of
the opinion that a large amount of in
formation could be procured from the
records of the Building and Loan Com
missioners of the State. No annual re
port has been printed for the Commis
sioners in five years, but the records
are available for. reference.
Another matter of concern to the
building and loan, associations now
pending is the appointment by Gover
nor Pardee of Building and Loan 'Com
missioners for the ensuing term. The
California League of Mutual Building
and Loan Associations has sent a let
ter to the Governor in which some sug
gestions were made relative to Com
missioners. ,
It is probable that the legislative
committee will call on the present
Building and Loan Commissioners to-,
day at their offices and begin investiga
tion in that way. {

The inquiry went over until Tuesday

"I paid Edwards $15 a week for three
weeks," said Mozetti. "but I stopped
paying him any money when I saw
that it was of no use, as people kept
complaining that my cows were at
large." -^
Supervisors Eggers and Rea engaged
in a verbal altercation over some ques
tions that were put to Mozetti by the
former, who wanted Mozetti to realize
the gravity of his charge against Ed
wards. Mozetti then testified that he
had on April 13 also paid $15 to A. L
Unger, superintendent of the pound,
who had asked him how much it would
be worth to him to have his cows roam
at large. Two weeks after Unger im
pounded his cows, and when Mozetti
complained Unger told him he was not
a man, as he had not lived up to his
agreement to pay for immunity. .
C. H. Holbrook, secretary of the So
ciety for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals, which conducts . the pound,
sought unsuccessfully to have Mozetti
admit that when he had offered money
to Unger the latter had ordered him
out of his office.
The; Supervisors' Police Committee
yesterday listened to evidence relative
to the petition of B. Mozetti, a dairy
man Of 1236 Berlin street,- for the re
funding to him of $315 which he was
compelled to pay to the poundmen for
the release of 105 cows which had been
Impounded. Mozetti stated that the
cows had got out of the corral through
no fault of his, and some one unknown
to him had broken down the fence and
permitted the animals to escape. G.
Berizinni, one of Mozetti's milkers, tes
tified that he had heard M. Edwards,
a deputy poundman, tell his employer,
that if he (Edwards) were paid 515 per
week Mozetti would be permitted to
let his cows run at large to feed on
grass and would be notified when the
poundmen proposed to round up the
herd. Several of Mozetti's employes
testified that the fence was in good
condition on the night previous to the
morning when the cows broke out. B.
Mozetti corroborated Berlzinni's evi
dence as to the offer made by Ed
wards.

Suggests a New Chinatown.
The United States Investment and
Improvement Company, through its
general manager, Charles E. Moody,
laid its plans of reclaiming China
town before the Forty-fourth Assem
bly District Improvement Club last
night. John Partridge, first vice pres
ident, and ex-Judge Denson, attorney
of the organization, also addressed the
club. The great value to the com
munity of the present quarters in
which the Chinese almost as a body
reside was demonstrated. The com
pany's plan is to build a new China
town on the water front, south of
Hunters Point.
With the full knowledge of the damn
ing documentary evidence against him.
Attorney Collins' attitude has in it
nothing but eagerness for the fight.
Confidence is in his every utterance
and every gesture, and the men who
have been against him say, "He can
beat even this â on technicalities."
Mrs. Charlotte Newman Collins will
be called before the Grand Jury to
morrow to tell the story of her wrongs.
The jurors will refuse to listen to any
statement from Attorney Collins.
George D. Collins may realize soon
what he says is his greatest wish at
present. The opening of the legal bat
tle In which he will try to prove that
Mrs. Charlotte Newman Collins is not
his wife seems not far distant. District
Attorney Byington announced yesterday
that he was prepared to advise the
Grand Jury to find an indictment
against Collins for bigamy. Mrs. Mc-
Curdy, mother of the second wife, was
located by Detective Tom Gibson yes
terday and will be on hand when her
testimony is needed.
It te now up to the Grand Jury. Act
ing Foreman E. J. Bowes has an
nounced that he will be guided entirely
by the advice of the District Attorney.
A meeting of the Grand Jury will be
called to-morrow and the evidence se
cured by Detective Gibson and the Dis
trict Attorney's office will be presented.
The indictment of Collins for bigamy is
certain to follow.

GOL.DEN SILENCE.
BIDWELL PARK.
TpHE CALL'S suggestion that the memory of General John
â¢ I Bidwell be perpetuated by giving his name to a national park
*\u25a0 or forest reserve in California has met with favor and caused
considerable correspondence. Our suggestion had been preceded
by one originating with General Chipman, president of the State
Board of Trade, tp the effect that one of the Marysville buttes,be
named for General Bidwell. Judging by the correspondence it is
deemed entirely appropriate to honor this pioneer by naming for
him a forest reserve or national park. There remains the question
of procedure. The Sacramento , Valley Development ./Association
and the Forests and Waters Society are very proper bodies to join
in procuring such a recommendation to the Interior Department and
the National Bureau of Forestry as will procure the desired result/
It is expected that Mr. Pinchot, chief of the Bureau of Forestry,
will be in this State during the summer,, and the matter can be
taken up with him personally.
General Bidwell 'was the first Calif ornian* to take up the matter
of forest presentation. Many! years went'by before the subject: at
tracted* general attention, but he* gave it ite; impetus,; and .all -of the
local literature on the subject is simply the expansion of hisearlv
exposition of the relation of the forest to the climate of the State
and the fertility of its soil. ; .
In many ways.he wasa foremost and, useful citizen. He served
:he State in Congress with rare and high intelligence, 'and on all
grounds of personal character, private example and public service
deserves that his .memory fee perpetuated. The.Semperyirens Tand
other forest and "mountain clubs will do tHemselves credit by aiding
the petition to the .Government which will give to his memory
deserved perpetuity. ','\u25a0\u25a0'.. ""[ :

1T has never happened before that a President, in a one day stop
I in any of our cities, has met as many men or settled as many
"questions as did President Roosevelt in his one day sojourn in
Chicago. His meeting with Shea and the other; strike leaders was
characterized by entire frankness on his part, and he left no chance
to misunderstand his position. His incisive declaration seems to
have been inspired by Shea's statement that he had wired the
Governor of Illinois telling what he, Shea, "would allow the Gov
ernor to do." Following this mistaken assumption of the right of
Shea to confer jurisdiction upon the Governor of Illinois or to
withhold it from him, was the further statement that the men
represented by Shea were pleading for arbitration, and for this
were to be shot down while in the attitude of supplication.
It is unfortunate that the welfare of any considerable number
of people should be in such keeping. When the teamsters' strike
began Shea declared that the men had no grievance and nothing to
arbitrate. He called them out, and now the news comes from
Peoria, Joliet, Elgin, Rockford, Bloomington and other outlying
towns that the teamsters arbitrarily ordered by Shea to quit work
are appearing in those places and asking for employment, declaring
that they have abandoned both Chicago and the union because me,n
like Shea keep the city in such an industrial turmoil that a work 1
ingman has no assurance of steady employment, no matter* how
anxious he may be to work or how much his employer desires his
service. Under such circumstances Shea's talk about George 111
and the army was something more than impertinent. No one in
Chicago but" Shea has prevented any one working. Shea's men
have murdered a large number of men and have wounded more for
trying to work and earn their bread without Shea's permission.
The President wasted ho words on the situation, but informed
Shea that mob rule cannot go in this country, and that if the city
of Chicago and the State of Illinois could not enforce the law and
make every man safe in his right to labor the United States would
do it. It is probable that the abnormal conceit of Shea was at last
penetrated by the realization that a mob cannot run this Govern
ment, even though it is taught to sanctify murder and cowardice by
the few catchwords that were mustered into service in the address
to the President.
This meeting with the representatives of the mob that has
paralyzed business in Chicago for the last three weeks, and has
made it unsafe and indeed acutely dangerous for travelers to go
through that city, would have been a day's work for an ordinary
man. For a politician it would have been a fearful experience.
Mayor Dunne, a politician, while each day claiming that he had
"the situation well in hand," had really no control of it at all. His
duty la}' dormant and unperformed, while men were murdered every
day in the street. But the President is not a politician. He is a
statesman and patriot and knows only one way to maintain liberty,
and that is by enforcing the law.
Having given Shea this information and also a very bad half
hour, President Roosevelt became the guest of the great Democratic J
organization, the Iroquois Club, and there spoke his mind, with j
extreme freedom on the necessity of compelling corporations to J
obey the law, and of giving them some more law to obey, in order .
to protect the rights of individuals against the aggression of com- j
binations. It is a tonic to 'public sentiment to have a man in the
Presidency who in even'- presence thinks right and utters what
he thinks. With one exception there is not a** Democratic leader in
the country who. under existing circumstances, would stand before
an audience in Chicago and say as did the President: "This Gov
ernment is not and never shall be the government of a plutocracy. \u25a0
This Government is ? not and never shall be the Government of aj
mob. If need arises, back of this city stands the State, and back of j
the State stands the nation. This shall remain a country of liberty |
and justice under the forms of lawi"
Having held the balance even, vindicated individual right
against Shea's mob and corporate aggression, the President . was
cheered by the Iroquois Democrats as they have never applauded
one of their own. His day's visit in Chicago enforced his declaration
for a square deal for everybody. If his invoking of the law against
the murderous disorders with which Shea has beset that city, put
ting it practically in a state of siege, produce no effect, the nation
will assert its function and law and order will be vindicated. If
(lie combined resistance to the President's anti-rebate policy for the
discipline of railroads shall temporarily prevail, the matter will go
before the people in the elections of next year and the people will
support him by a larger majority than they gave him for the Presir
dency. : . .
They want what he says they. should have. They want the
right of private contract preserved. They want industrial peace
and equilibrium, and the freedom of the streets and highways for
i* very honest man to use in the pursuit of his vocation. They want
â¢very man to be free from the arbitrary will of another, and, all to
!Ve equally subject to the law of the land. They want a square deal
for everybody from the corporations and absolute equality of treat
â¢nent. They want competition to have a chance, and they want
5 he rights of one man held sacred against the aggressions of organ
ised labor or organized capital. It is. a distinctly American. pr'6- !
gramme, and the President has the American people with him in
making it. an effective national policy. / [

"What is the secret of the -English

some one of a traveling Englishman. f
' ' "The secret," he said, : "lies in your
own \ homes. The English woman
i Iwouid never in the world think ;of
j Sleeping in the atmosphere in which
you Americans live. iShe-sleeps in>a
[room that is almost down to freezing.
\ She bathes in cold water and she sits
I in a cool apartment during the day.
[Then she walks out a great deal.
''\u25a0 "The English [woman,'.' said , i he.
'â¢while' beautifully â¢'-dressed, is less fond
of 'dress" than >an American woman,
and : the Ve S uit is* not difficult to be

"I ' notice." said he," Yin a walk
through' "your } parks that your women
seldom; or never tak* the air In this
manner. When the American woman
goes out she goes to shop. She hurries
'from one r hot- store *to another and
when she, gets home she has a shop
ping headache. [.Â»\u25a0'â¢
"In three "months 4n America I never
once saw an -American -woman out for

thing, Important to. do. There is no

"Now; the- English woman does not
work in this way. She looks after her

them to school." Then she does her

will spend money on telephone mes

'"The English .woman, on the other
hand, will get out and do her own

and her groceries , and will â¢ sro from
green grocer to green grocer selecting
what is to be eaten during the day.
j; "And the result Isobvlous. She gets

ground that Holmes gave the board I
the right to use the process..- No ap-i

Supreme Court. On the retrial of the j
case Judge Morrow instructed the Jury t
to find for the defendants, the" Harbor j

made by Attorney V Stratton that

ed damages amounting to" j 535.000 If
an agreementto which 'he (Holmes)
I subscribed allowing * the board ito j| use
\u25a0 the process pending the litigation had j

j Mrs. Rowena Wewerka, who is being
j sued for divorce by Joseph Wewerka
j on the ground, that she was unduly ln
j timate with one Frank Tiffins, raises a
j unique defence in her answer, filed yes
terday. After denying her husband's
j charge she says that all the trouble
I between herself , and her husband has
been due to his fruitless search for his
"heart's desire" In the shape of a true
woman. \u25a0 .-. 1
"Before we separated," says Mrs.
Wewerka in her answer, "my husband
caused to be inserted in the local pa
pers the following advertisement: 'A
gentleman with a/ true heart, wants to
meet an honest woman. Object, matri- "-.
mony. My heart's desire is a true
companion.'" ;. ; ,
Out of the raft of answers to his ad- I
vertlsement, eaya Mrs. Wewerka, her j
husband found several that led him to i
( alliances that were far from honorable. 'â¢
Hence she a&ks that she be given ; a j
decree and that his prayer bÂ« denied
in toto by the court. Wewerka is a I
master painter, whose place of business ]
la at â¬20 Eddy street. . j
I* D. Batchelor tells a harrowing j
tale in the complaint for divorce he |
filed yesterday against Susie Batchelor. |
He says his wife threatened to poison ,
him, threatened to throw vitriol in^hlsl
face and attempted to > throw a lighted I
lamp at him, and, not content with j
this, entered into shameful relations
with all the tradespeople that visited i
the house, and then boasted of her j
sins. The language Batchelor credits â¢
to his wife is far beyond the general]
line of divorce court quotations and
makes it evident that the. matrimonial
experience of the plaintiff has been one j
of great hardship, if his allegations are :
true.
Mrs. Ena Dolan was granted a di
vorce from Philip Dolan by ' Judge Mu
rasky on the ground of desertion. Do- I
lan conducted a saloon for years on '
; Merchant street, and his wife testified !
he accumulated $40,000. The court on j
this showing granted Mrs. Dolan ali
mony in the sum of $100 a month,
! though she only, asked for $60. How
ever, it is doubtful, that Mrs. Dolan J
will be able to collect the alimony, for
it is said Dolan has gone to the home
of his youth in far-away Ireland.
Decrees of divorce were also granted
to Elsie M. Cleary from George M.
Cleary for infidelity, Julia Neer from
Btewart S. Neer for cruelty, and George
H. Sterne from Annie E. Sterne for de
sertion.
The suit brought by Ida Grant for
divorce from John D. Grant Is on trial
before Judge Hebbard. Mrs. Grant
'testified that her /husband used to eat
his meals while a large revolver rested
beside his plate, and constantly, re
minded his family that if things were
not run to suit him he would "emulate j
Murderer, Dunham" and "clean out the!
whole, works.". : - , .'â.-. -â . ..I
Suits for divorce' were also filed yes- >

tem, centering in the brain.
This irritation produces pain
in the head/ and the turbulent

ach causes nausea, vomiting.

is dangerous, as frequent and
prolonged attacks weaken the
Drain, resulting in loss of
memory, inflammation, epi-
lepsy, fits, dizziness, etc
Allay this stormy r irritated,
aching condition by taking
Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills.
They stop the paki by sooth-
ing:, strengthening and reliev-
ing the tension upon 5 the nerves
ânot by paralyzing- them, as
do most headache remedies.

chloraljcocaine or similar, drugs.
"F'.ck headache Is hereditary. In my '

. Williams, falling: from his -runaway
1 mount, Don Hamilton, going to the
j post In the first race at the Fair
Grounds to-day, still clung to the reins
and stopped the colt, he saved the day
for a big coup by W. W. Elliott, the
horse's owner. Don Hamilton was 15 to
1 in the betting at the track, and the
out-of-town poolrooms were hard hit.
A loose saddle girth caused thÂ« slip
that almost spoiled the killing. Monte
made a show of LJttle Scout in the fea-

money than any horÂ«e of his' age in
1804, was disqualified to-day in the
third race after he had barely suc
ceeded in defeating Frank Regan's
three-year-old filly. Witch HazeL Hot
Spot, the only other starter, was beat
en several lengths. The heavy spec
ulators had odds of 1 to 7 on Delhi, :
but the people most hurt were the j
bookmakers, who were forced to pay
out place bets on both Witch Hazel
and Hot Spot. Under the rules Del
hi received no nart of the money. He
wbs not even placed third, the stew

Oregon Crop Bullednu
The rtpcrt cf Edward A. Beats, section dl
tÂ»Â«or IJx^ted Ststes Weather Bureau, for the
Oregon Crop Bulletin, week ended May Â», Is
as follows :
The weather duricg the past week was fa
vorable for the growth of field crops. ' Qood
rains fell esst of the Cascade oa
Tutsday and Wednesday, but in the western
portion of the State the rainfall was very
ll^ht and occurred at widely separated places.
and more rain is needed in this section. As
si rule ths weather was too cool for rapid
growth, and a few warm, sunshiny days would
be very beneficial to all vegetation.
The condition of the grain crop, both fail
and spring sown., continues excellent. Fall
wheat is turning yellow in some localities, but
this ie eonfinr-d moetly to that sown on iow
land. Oats, rye and barley continue to head
eatipfactorily. Hops in the old yards have
ccme up unevenly and there are complaints
cf many missing "hills. In the new yards,
where properly cultivated, the condition cf the
crop &rj>Â«rs to be more promising. Reports,
however, as to the general condition cf the
bop crop are conflicting, varying from excellent
to good". There is an absence of vermin, ex
cept possibly in a few places along the river
bottoms, where the vines were shaded by tall
timber. \u25a0 '
Gardens, potatoes and corn, while growing
slowly, are generally in excellent -condition.
Corn haÂ« come up well, and in Southern Ore
gon cultivating has btgun. \u25a0â¢ Grass.- clover,
vetch and pÂ«*tures are growing rapidly.
Prunes, peaches, early cherries and goose
berries were mostly killed by the frosts, but
pears.Â» Uw cherries, currants and some, varie
ties of early, apples promise fairly good yields.
Strawberries appear to have escaped injury by
frost In some sections, while in others the
crop Â«it quite badly damaged. - -Late apples
indicate a rather light yield.- \u25a0 . :';:~-i. L .

New York Stock Market.
NEW TORK. May ILâ The conÂ«lderable
movement which developed late to-day In the
stocks connected with the Northern Securities
settlement, or associated with that settlement
In ex>eculatlve surmises, redeemed the securi
ties market from a rut of dullnees and neglect
that threatened to exceed yesterday's^ record.
This movement served also to reassert the ln
fiueaoe of this group of -stocks on speculative
opinion in general. Previous to their revived
activity the market showed no \u25a0 sign of any
thing more than a f eeble vibration In the re
bound from yesterday's ellght depression.
Southern Pacific and Union Pacific were the
leaders of this rebound on 'their circulation of
assertions that the policy of their administra
tion waa slipping toward the- Inauguration of
dividends on Southern Pacific. The buying in
duced by these assertions was quite sub
stantial In comparison with the semi-stagna
tion of the general market. The movement laid
the foundation for the share of thoee two
stocks In the latter strength of the more lm
laedlate Northern Securities group, and North
ern Pacific Itself shared on the curb. North
ern Pacific and \u25a0 Great . Northern preferred
moved npward easily, which Is attributed to
the very small business of these stocks In the
epen^ market. The fact of thie scanty -supply
leaves the wide movements in the stocks open
to suspicion of manipulation, which is , easily
managed In the cane of eloeely held stocks of
that class. No sews came out to explain the
movement; but it resulted naturally In re>
twakeslsg ill at rumor* < pointing to v ad-
Juftment of threatened dlrpute over the North
em Pacific control. There was no other news
Â«f the day that seemed to hare effective in
fluence on - stocks, unleee it might be !n
prompting the abstention - from active opera
tions. A tendency was shown both In London
end here to await the completion of the set
tlement In London to-morrow. Other repres
sive Influence* cf a general character were
found .la the reiteration of the President's
rlews -on railroad rate legislation, and - the
elscuaslon by the Comptroller Â«f the -Currency
cf the duties of bank directors, which was
prompted by r,ecent events In' the" banking
world growing out of affairs of the Equitable
Li.*Â© Assurance Society. The weakness of the
local transactions was out of consideration of
the expected decision by the . Supreme Court
en the franchise tax law. Money- was ei
tremejy easy and it is believed that thic Is
partly due to the progress of remittances from
interior national banks in preparation for pay
ment on Monday tbrougn their New York
correspondent* on the return of- Government
deposit* under the. call of the Secretary of the
Treasury. .Sterling Exchange held its advance
Â«* yeeterdsy. Stocks closed strong, but oaly
â¢wifrately active. â¢- *

*ick man . and was ordered by DrÂ«.
Kenyon. and "Burnham to Honolulu.
The climate there, did; him no good/ so
several weeks ago he went to Japan.
It was said that Mr. Benedict" was In
Honolulu when the , attachment was
levied.' but: this is a mistake. : Mr.
Benedict was ~ not , trying to axÂ«oid the
suit In any way.- and knows nothing of
what is going on in' this dty.>
The attachment that was levied on
Tuesday against the property of C. S.
Benedict by the creditors of the Pa

â¢without the knowledge of Mr. Bene

There are few persons who have a
right to precedence in making selec
tions when the lands are finally of
fered, less than half a dozen in aIL
These parties get their right under an
set of Congress that restricts such
privileges to those who held claim un
der former laws and rulings on Jan
uary 1, 1904. This act became law- this
y?ar. In the Round Valley are thou
sands of acres of good land and many
eyes have been attracted to its fruit
fulness. The valley has a history in
connection with the operations of
White, who was known aaa cattle king
some years ago.
Great news for those who expect to
become land owners in Round Valley
in this State has been received by Sur r
veyor General Graham from Commls
eior.er Richards of the General Land
Office. at Washington. S(/me time ago
it was announced officially that the val
ley, would not be offered for sale
until after a new survey had been made
and the land had been appraised. This
meant a delay of at. least. two years.
This has all been changed. Commis
sioner Richards has Just written 'that
he'*.vishes information concerning the
ti..ie when supplementary plats can be
forwarded to him from the Surveyor
General's office In this city. The Sur
veyc-r General has answered that the
plats can be gent; forward in June. The
old surveys would. therefore seem to be
considered to be acceptable to some ex
tent'and the supplementary plats may
supply all the additional Information
that the Commissioner of the General
Land Office requires.
This does nor Imply that : the land
vii}, be ready for allotment to those
who are ready to pay the Government's
price for it in June. The land must all
be. appraised in quarter-sections, and
ihat will tcke some time, but Commis
sioner Richards' act , will probably
bring the valley into the market years
earlier than would have been possible
uuder the first intention of the depart
ment. - - -. . â¢ \u25a0
A . peculiar feature of an immoral
phase of Japanese civilization is being
exploited by United States Immigrant
Commissioner North in the case of a
young and handsome Japanese wom
an named Yuki Xakamura, who ar
rived on the 'steamship. Coptic. on May
1. . She. was released from quarantine
last Wednesday and with, her: infant
son was placed in the detention shed
on the Mail dock, pending investiga
tion as to her right to be admitted to
this country.. According to her story
she entered into a provisional contract
marriage ;in Japan two years "and â¢ a
half ago with Choichi Fukutsu.-.-The
contract stipulated that they , should
live together as man and wife and
that if at the end of two years either;
party should be dissatisfied the con
tract should terminate and the parties
should be f,ree and in the conditlonof
unmarried persons, provided that .the
. husband should rear the offspring.
Such contract, she said, was legal; in
Japan. Shortly after the -signing of
the contract the couple came to -Los
Angeles, . In which city Fukutsu keeps
a restaurant. The woman returned to
Japan- and gave, birth to the /child.
She has returned/she -said, for the
purpose of being permanently > mar
ried to Fukutsu, the contract- having
expired six months ago.
The local Immigrant' officials do not
regard the validity 'of such contract in
this country! and . hold . that the woman
had been leading 'an immoral life," but
are willing to : admit the ;woman;and
her baby on condition that before
landing she be married : accorHing to
the lawn of this country to the Los
Angeles -merchant. Yesterday morn
ing a Japanese claiming, to be a friend
of the husband called', at the -, immi
grant office and said that the husband
was sick in bed and could not come, to
this city.' The- woman, is being: held
for Investigation.' \ -, " :
