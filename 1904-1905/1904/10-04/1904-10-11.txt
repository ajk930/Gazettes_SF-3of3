"Only six miles separate the advance
lines," said the officer referred to. "and
an advance or counter-advance might
precipitate a preliminary artillery en
gagement at any moment."
It is now evident that Field Marshal
Oyama, aware that Kuropatkin is pre
paring to strike, instead of extending
himself for the big flanking movement
east, so much talked of. has recognized
the necessity of meeting the Russian
advance by ."ortifylng his positions
north of Liaoyang. The Interval be
tween the eventful collision will doubt
less be utilized by both sides in feeling
out their respective strength and dis
positions and in active skirmishing on
the flanks, of which the daring march
of the Cossacks across the Shakhe
River, almost to the Tental mines, is
an example. Not until the combined
movements of Kuropatkln's army are
in full swin? southward will it be seen
whether Oyama intends to contest the
present advance or fall back on the
fortified positions north of Liaoyang.
where he would reverse -the situation
heretofore, as the Japanese would for
the first time enjoy the advantage of
fighting behind defenses.
According to the estimates of the
War Office. Oyama's total strength is
about 260,000 men. of which 150.000 are
posted between the Hun River, to the
west of the Bentsiaputze eastward, the
remainder being held In reserve at
Liaoyang. Kuropatkin disposes of nine
corps, giving him perhaps a slight su
periority in numterg.
Lieutenant General Grippenber*. who
is to command the second Manchurian
army, will take wit!i him u> the front a
large portion. of. the. troois of the Vilna
military district, over which he has
had the command for three years. Thua
the. bulk of . the second .army will be
composed of men and. officers of whom
the "general has intimate knowledge.
The Second. Third. Fourth and Nine
teenth corps are Included in the dis
trict. The mobilization is already qui
etly proceeding/
With Kuropatkin acting on the of
fensive, reJnfr âÂ«m'ents will be pushed
for â¢ rd Â¦ with all- possible speed. The
first echelons of the Eighth Corps are
on their way to the front, and it is ex
pected to start one corps of the Vilna
district within a fortnight. The Em
peror will bid the troops farewell. â¢
â¢ It is now apparent that the Russians
propose to make a winter campaign, as
they did during the Russo-Turklsh
War.
ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. 10.â The
capture of 'Bentsiaputze, which was
strongly fortified and where it was re
ported General Kuroki commanded in
person,- is officially confirmed. The
fighting, however, was not severe, the
Japanese retiring on finding themselves
outflanked. The Russian losses were
only twenty-five killed and wounded,
including an officer.
A high officer of the general staff
said to-day that Kuropatkin is pre
pared to advance with great care, but
when the main collision will occur will
depend on circumstances, the move
ments 6f great bodies of men being
slow operations. Heavy fighting is
hardly likely before a week at the
earliest.
â¢It is reported that the J.panesehave
abandoned â¢- Siancha n, > Saimatsze .- and
Meichoulin, positions east of- Liaoyang.
In political circles considerable stress
is laid upon ; the moral effect upon the
Chinese that may. be expected from Gen
eral Kuropatkln's . advancing :Â¦ i without
being, compelled to, abandon ; the sacred
'city of â¢Mukden,;- it' being 'remembered
that the Japanese 1 failed * to reach the
city of imperial tombs during the Chi
no-Japanese war.
According . to unofficial reports, Field
Marshal Oyama, at the first sign of
General Kuropatkin taking the offen
sive, began drawing in his line and con
centrating upon fortified positions
north of Liaoyang. According to the
latest reports, which are contained in a
dispatch from Mukden, dated at ' 6
6 o'clock to-night, the Japanese out
posts are being driven in all along the
line.
The strategy of the forward move
ment will "be concealed, as were the
preparations for the advance, so that
all surmises as to where General Kuro
patkin intends to strike are mere
guesswork. It is not clear whether
General Kuropatkin contemplates a
blow on the left, center or right of the
Japanese army, but the fact that stress
is laid upon the capture of Bentsla
putze, which opens the road and forts
to Bensihu, twenty miles east of Liao
yang, where General Kuroki crosses, and
that Cossacks are already reported in
the neighborhood of the stream, might
foreshadow an exact reversal of the
battle of Liaoyang,. this time the Ru#
sian commander flanking and turning
Liac-yang with his left, as Field Mar
shal Oyama did with his right. Little
light had been thrown upon the consid
erations which led General Kuropatkin
to suddenly assume the offensive,- but
no word is heard at the War Office in
timating that the course savors of
rashness. Officers of the general staff,
while not underestimating the. heavy
task and severe sacrifices that are in
volved in i assuming, the â¢ offensive,
nevertheless express absolute confi
dence ' that General jj Kuropatkin J has
found ; a . weak point ; in the Japanese
armies. Different explanations abound
as to the reason for making the for
ward movement at this time. The ad
vance is attributea to a realization by
General Kuropatkin of the difficulty the
Japanese encountered In making : good
their losses at Liaoyang and replenish
ing their supplies | and ammunition, or
possibly to the drawing off of a portion
of the .Japanese troops to reinforce
General Nogi; in- a J desperate endeavor
to end. thesiege of Port Arthur. !
- Whatever the explanation, it is ap
parent from the hasty manner, in which
the Japanese withdrew before the first
show of -Russian strength that their re
cent r ostentatious preparations for an
advance 'were largely bluff. The best
opinion here is'that the pending battle
is likely to develop with startling ra
ipidity. ;

m.~A; battle., upon which â the \t ate Of
this year's campaign in Manchuria de
pends, seems only a few days ahead.
Advices from the f/ont are meager. All
that is positively known officially is
that General Kuropatkin has cast the
die at last, about faced his army and is
marching resolutely against the enemy
as If resolved to do or die.

Diplomatic circles are discussing the
story with interest. While it is classed
in the same category as other similar
stories by most of the diplomats it
finds more credence in quarters not
particularly noted for friendliness
either to Russia or Germany, it being
even asserted that the recent visit of
Grand Duke Vladimir to Berlin, os
tensibly to consult a specialist, in real
ity was to confer with Emperor Wil

being tHe invention of enemies of both

to the proposed strike in the ranks of
the daughters, who are here for their
annual convention. The strikers were
members of the St. Louis Chapter of

have done for the entertainment of

MRS. FAIRBANKS RESTORES
HARMONY IN THE RAXKS
WASHINGTON, Oc. 10.â Judge La
combe, in the United States Circuit
Court to-day, handed down a decision
denying the application of the Federal
authorities for reargument of the
habeas corpus proceedings of John A.
Benson, the California millionaire
charged with havlnr perpetrated exten
sive land frauds against the Govern
ment, through which he secured title to
several hundred thousand acres of gov
ernment land in California and Oregon.
Benson was indicted several months
ago in Washington on a charge of
bribing clerks in the lan^ office to se
cure information and also on a charge
of alleged fraudulent practices in ob
taining lands. Indicted with him on
the latter charge were Frederick A.
Hyde, Henry P. Dimond and Joost
Schneider, of San Francisco, who are
under arrest. Benson was axrested in
this city and at once applied for a writ
of habeas corpus and certlorari against
his removal to Washington, where the
indictments were found. Judge La
combe granted the writ, discharging
Benson on the ground that the indict
ments did not show that Benson had
conspired to defraud the United States.
In the case of the other .defendants,
who had taken the same steps in the
California jurisdiclio- Judge Morrow
held that the Indictments were ma
terial and remanded the defendants
into custody. Because of the recent
Illness of Frank H. Platt. counsel for
Benson, and the latter's absence In
California, no order discharging him
from custody has been entered. As
sistant United States Dis.-ict Attorney
Baldwin applied for a reargument of
the habeas corr--- proceedings. In de
nying the application, Judge Lacombe
sayr.
"The application for a rehearing is
denied. Whereas it appears the Fed
eral courts in California have subse
quently reached a different conclusion
as to the meaning of the statute, it
would seem that the best way to secure
uniformity is by an appeal, rather
than by suggestion that the first de
cision be modified."

here to-night. He made an earnest
plea .for the election of Joseph W. Folk,
Democratic candidate for Governor of
Missouri.
Referring to the national campaign,
Bryan said he believed his hearers
would give him credit for courage
enough to oppose Parker openly if he
did not consider him the best man for
the place and said he hoped - that his
reputation for truth and. veracity was
such that his friends would believe him
when he said he was supporting the
Democratic nominees by every means in
his power. He said that he was sup
porting Parker because in all things
where Parker was weak, according to
his view, Roosevelt was weaker.

The wise man of to-day makes provi

not do this does not know the value of

gazes backward over the road that can
not be again traversed. He looks with
envy upon his rich neighbor, but if he
reflects he will find that he has no one
but himself to blame. He will find that
his neighbor saved his money while he
was earning it. You can do the same

Storm I'lays Serious Havoc Amonz
Vineyards at Colfax.
COLFAX. Oct. 10. â The last "three
days of storm, the heaviest ever re
corded in this part of the country for
this season of the year, have wrought
havoc to the vineyardists in this sec
tion. Less than half of the grape crop
had been gathered in previous to the
breaking of the storm, but ranchers
report that that portion which was left
on the vines is a total loss. The fitful
fhowers of Saturday developed Into a
storm which late in the afternoon as-
Kumed the proportions of a cloudburst.
In twenty minutes 1.45 inches fell.
This was followed by a driving hail
storm which caused the already soft
ened skins of the grapes to burst, thus
rendering- the fruit unfit for any mar
ket. From this shipping point alone
the lo?s will approximate $100,000.
The total precipitation for the sea
son is S.10 inches as against 3.2 inches
for las?t year. Heavy snows are re

The passenger train consisting of
day coaches, a Pullman car and a ca
boose, was loaded with Wprld's Fair
excursionists from southeast Kansas
and southwest Missouri. The regular
pasenger train No. 30 had been cut in
two at Pleasant Hill on account of the
heavy load and an engine attached to
the front car without a baggage car as
a buffer.
The extra freight had sidetracked at
Montserrat for the first section of
No. 30, which carried signals that a
second section was following. This was
followed by passenger train No. 50,
which the freight crew took for the
second section of No. 30. The freight
pulled out of the sidetrack and three
miles west met the second section.
The impact telescoped the tender of
the passenger engine into the front car,
which was loaded with passengers, and
It was' here that the sacrifice of life
took place. The passenger conductor,
E. L. Barnes, ran all the way to War
rensburg and broke the news of the
wreck. Every physician In the town
responded and hundreds of citizens
hastened to the wreck and assisted the
wounded from beneath the timbers of
the broken cars. Twenty people were
killed outright and seven died before
6 o'clock. The dead were placed upon
fiat cars and brought to this city and
Dr. Bills, thÂ« coroner, immediately im-
paneled a. Jury and started an Inquiry,
which is still in session.
The afternoon was taken up in Iden
tifying the dead, and to-night the con
ductor of the freight train Is on the
stand. He claims to have been dozing
while his train was .at Montserrat
and when train No. 50 passed Engineer
Horton believed it was the second sec
tion of No. 30, and, thinking the track
clear, pulled out on the main line.

WIL/Li SPEAK AT ESOPUS.
CENTRAL CITY, Neb.. Oct. 10.â At
this place Senator Fairbanks discussed
the currency question, referring to the
contest of 1896 over the gold standard
and complimenting- Edward Rosewater,
proprietor of the Omaha Bee, for his
stanch advocacy of sound money. Fair
banks contended that the victory 61
the gold standard and- of the Repub
lican party had had a generally bene
ficial effect. â¢ i
The meeting at which Senator Fair
banks spoke was held in the new Audi
torium. In addition to the discussion
of the trusts he touched upon the tariff
question and discussed other issues. He
said the Dingley law had had the effect
of opening many factories and of
spreading prosperity from one end of
the country to the other. He outlined
the policy of the Republican party with
reference to the Panama canal, claim
ing for that party all the credit for
what had been done in the interest of
that enterprise.
LEXINGTON, Neb., Oct. 10.âLexing
ton greeted Senator Fairbanks with a
large crowd and he spoke for about
ten minutes. He -contrasted the recr
ords of the two parties on economic
questions to the advantage of the Re
publicans and urged the popular sup
port of the ticket headed by Theodore
Roosevelt.
The Republican party, haa sought In a wise
and eftiKitive way U> restrain the abuses which
have -grown out of. the Â¦ development. It has
not made war .upon enterprises engaged In
wholesome Industry or -commerce. It has not
been provokvd to strike out against good and
bad alike, but . has sought to ascertain the
evilj existing and that' are liable to arise and
to enact laws to cure or prevent them. It has
done practically all that has been accom
plished under .national; authority. In a way
not - only to ' restrain or to prevent abuses of
corporate -po^er, but' It has effectively en
forced Uiq laws, which were enacted by it,
fearlessly and without partiality. Whenever
laws have been deemed 'necessary In the pub
lic Â¦ interest,' the Republican" party has put
them upon the statute books and It has ex
ecuted them as they were Intended and as the
public interest required.
It h,-,s not souvht nor does it seek to inter
fere with capital which tends to promote
wholesome â¢ Industry "or commerce, for It real
izes that'-,to Impose i any unust limitation
ui>dn capital- 1 employed in proper productive
enterprise or In transportation would be to
restrict the field of labor and capital and
check development. We seek to deal with"
abueee and -.wrongs, and not with capital
which is engaged in promoting .wholesome en
terprises. . The unwritten law of supply and
demand has the sanction- of antiquity. It lies
at the foundation of > our largest and best '
commercial growth, and It should be arrested
in Its operation only when the public welfare
requires. '
We should be as earnest in the protection
of the capital employed in the proper promo
tion of Industry and commerce as we should
be In guarding against its use for improper
purposes. We must always realize that labor
and capital are the two great instruments in
industrial nnd national development and that
we should be observant of their rights. We
should not be moved to pursue an unjust or..
hostile course toward either. Kach should be
encouraged In promoting in its respective
sphere our highest and best development. If
we are but Inspired with a sense of Justice
and turn a deaf ear to mere passion and
prejudice, we shall have little difficulty In
solving the great problems which await us.
Trusts may ' be " strong, but the Government
Is stronger. There Is no combination which
Is net amenable to the public law. The de
velopment of our Industries and the expan
sion. of our commerce have' made combinations
of .capital necessary. It would be Impossible
to. transact the. presents-business of the coun
try without-^ the' use ' ol larger capital In
manufacture and transportation than was
necessary a few years ago. The evolution In
our business alTairs has been rapid and radi
cal, and It has. beA attended with some abuses
which have called for the Interposition of
law. . . Â¦

CHICAGO. Oct. 10. â What is re
garded as one of the most important
sessions of the Interstate Commerce
Commission this year was held here
to-day. The feature of the meeting
was an inquiry into the relations ot
private car companies and railroad
companies, and the effect on trade. J.
W. Midgley. the principal witness, de
clared that the system of private
ownership of cars "had the railroad
companies firmly in Its grasp" and was
"one of the greatest powers ever
known."
Asked for a solution of the diffi
culty. Midgley suggested a per diem
system. "Put refrigerator cars on a
per diem of 50 cents for bo much
â¢weight." said he. "stock cars on a 30
cent basis and other cars on a 20-cent
basis." -.

here about two months ago. It was
noticed when he settled his bill that
he had a long buckskin purse with
considerable gold in it, and It ia
thought that the fact was noticed by
some bystander and that he was mur

A scientist, humanitarian and . of
royal birth, Kropotkin is a genius of
the age; not only does his colossal in
tellect cause him to stand in bold re
lief, but his personality is one of in
describable and unduplicated power,
Tolstoi, an art lover of finest fiber,
subjugated his inclination in order to
become an advocate. and worker for the
lower classes. Like him, Kropotkin
sacrificed his passion for scientific re
search to the needs of the masses, for
whom he works unremittingly, teach
ing, enlightening and leading in the
path of progress. Children of the soil
though they are, Kropotkin speaks of
their receptiveness and clarity of brain
power as contrasted with that of the
aristocracy, whose, -very environment
of domination has befogged its mind.
Miss Strunsky spoke with great ear
nestness â so much so that every-list
ener was rapt, and the close of her
speech brought her a deserved ova
tion.
Anna Strunsky, noted widely for her
literary work, has proved her clever
ness in the matter of public address.
Speaking before the Philomath Club
yesterday afternoon Miss Strunsky
held her audience speliDound, exploit
ing in detail incidents in the life of
Prince Peter Kropotkin. It was fit
ting that the series of talks upon Rus
sia should be' opened by a Russian,
and Miss Strunsky's magnetic enthusi
asm, and yet simple language, lent
such charm to her subject that the
information was of double interest, A
mistake in a preceding announcement
named the subject to be Kuropatkin,
now in 'military prominence, but the
life of Prince Kropotkin proved to be
of equal interest.* -

Wynne was formally inducted into
his office at 4 o'clock this afternoon.
Wynne was appointed First Assist
ant Postmaster General on April 17,
1002. For nearly a quarter of a cen
tury he had been a Washington news
paper correspondent, serving at vari
ous times some of the most important
newspapers in the country. At the
time of his appointment he was Wash
ington correspondent of the New York
Press. It was information he had se
cured as a newspaper correspondent,
corroborated and reinforced by evi
dences found in his department after
his appointment, that led Wynne to
make the recommendation to Post
master General Payne which resulted
In the sensational developments in the
Postoffice Department.
It is thought probable Wynne will
be succeeded by Cortelyou as Post
master General about January 1, 1905.
Meantime a successor to Wynne will
likely not be appointed.
Two days after the death of Payne
the President so designated Wynne
and indicated his intention of naming
him, Postmaster General until such
such time as George B. Cortelyou,
chairman of 'the Republican National
Committee, could arrange his affairs
so as to assume the duties of Postmas
ter General.
The appointment of Wynne as a
member of the President's Cabinet
was not unexpected by those in close
touch with the situation. It was
known that in the event of Payne's
death the President would designate
Wynne as acting Pastmaster General
because of his familiarity as First As
sistant Postmaster General with the
duties.

"McDonald then said, 'If you testify
against Wyman we will try to rail
road you. -We will produce witnesses
to show that you induced Wyman to
vote fraudulently. We will prove that
you put Wyman ud to -vote.' I an
swered that 1 would tell the truth un
der any circumstances." .
Doyle next told of a visit of Garrity
to the witness' brother to make
threats. The wives of both brothers
v/ere -also present, but inasmuch as
Doyle did not himself hear what was
said, Judge Cabaniss would not let
him tell the story.
The cross-examination of Doyle was
without bridle on the attorney for the
defendant, and, although the prosecu
tion and the court fussed and fumed
over the waste of time occasioned by
the extraneous matter, Countryman
had his way. While the salient points
of the testimony of the witness were
not shaken, he had an uncomfortable
time of it on the stand because of his
fear to admit that he had talked over
the case with Fairfax Wheelan and the
detective employed by the Merchants'
Association to gather evidence.
LAWYERS IN A SCRIMMAGE.
So energ'etic did Attorney Country
man become in his efforts to break
down the witness that a clash between
him and Attorney Hosmer relieved the
impatience of Judge Cabaniss for a
moment. Counsel for the prosecution
objected to a question and a comment
by Countryman that brought a hot re
mark from Hosmer that the defense
would "bear watching."
"You and your gang- will certainly
bear watching as well," was Country
man's rejoinder.
A few minutes later Hosmer told
Countryman, who was handling wit-,
ness Doyle in a lively manner, that
"there is a straight way of doing things
and there are ways of conducting a
case that are not straight."
Countryman repeatedly asked Doyle
if, in order to induce him to testify
against Wyman, he had not been as
sured of protection from prosecution
for attempt at illegal voting himself.
He admitted picking up a ballot In the
booth, but nothing was brought forward
to show any criminal intent. His ex
planation was that he looked at the
ballot because he thought it would
show how many votes had been cast.
When asked if he had not consulted
divers persons as to the danger of pros
ecution and also if he had not informed
them that the Merchants' Association's
detective promised him Immunity, he
answered that he could not remember
having had such conversations.
ALiTj PROSECUTIONS MAY FAIili.
Attorney Countryman entered a form
al objection to proceeding further with
the examination on the ground, as he
claimed, that there was no penalty
clause in the primary law, under which
Wyman was being prosecuted. He
contended that section 64^ of the Penal
Code fell with the primary law of 1899,
when' the Supreme Court declared it
unconstitutional, and the Legislature
having failed to re-enact it there is no
provision for punishing Infractions cf
the primary law of 1901. This is the
point that Judge Sloss, in the recent
habeas corpus proceedings before him,
declared to have "considerable force."
Many lawyers are of the opinion thai
Countryman Is correct in his view and
will be successful when he sues out a
writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme
Court, which he intends to do some
time this week. Judge Cabaniss denied
Countryman's motion.
"I don't want Wyman dismissed on
any habeas corpus proceeding," de
clared Maestretti yesterday. "I want
him freed of the accusation on the mer
its of the testimony. It Is very ap
parent that Wyman is not the man
aimed at particularly In- this prosecu
tion, and these other people are respon
sible for the resort to habeas corpus in
an endeavor to have the primary law
knocked out. As = the expression goes,
they are trying to make a fall guy out
of Wyman." ,
The preliminary examination will be
resumed on Friday afternoon.
The testimony of Fairfax H. Wheelan
and his son that they saw Charles Wy
nian forge. the name of S- H. Mann on
the precinct roster and. cast the fraud
ulent . ballot was corroborated In part
by Special Policeman Joseph T. Doyle
yesterday at the preliminary examina
tion in progress before Police Judge
Cabaniss. The witness gave a sensa
tional turn to the case by declaring
that two men had made threats against
him in an effort to prevent him from
testifying.-
Doyle said that he saw the defendant
with register in hand sit down at the
booth table and copy a name on the
rcster and then go through the pro
ceeding of voting the baliot. At the
same time the witness saw Wheelan
make notes in a memorandum book
and look at his watch, apparently mak
ing an entry of the time.
After he had deposited the ballot,
Wyman stepped up to the witness and
with eyes fastened on Wheelan, re
marked, "I guess that man was watch
ing me." Then the defendant added:
"If it had been a vote for Cassidy it
would have been all right." Cassidy
was heading the light for the inde
pendent Republican ticket, in the inter
est of which Wheelan was working at
the polls and which was put forward
in opposition to the ticket of the Maes
tretti faction.
The men whom Doyle accuses of at
tempted intimidation are Tod McDon
ald and Thomas Garrity. who are af
filiated in politics with the faction of
which Public Works Commissioner
Frank A. Maestretti is the leader in
the Forty-third Assembly. District.
TWO MEN TIIKEATKN WITNESS.
"One evening about a week ago,"
Doyle testified, "Tod McDonald and
Thomas Garrity met me at Bush and
Baker streets, very near the room' used
as the voting place, and began talk
ing of the Wyman case. McDonald
spoke up and said, 'You don't want to
send this fellow to jail." I replied that
I would have to protect myself in the
.matter.

of Buffalo. N. Y.. discovered a remedy i
that is a blood-maker and tissue-builder,
at the same time alleviates a cough. He
called it Dr. Picrce's Golden Medical Dis-
coveryâan alterative extract that assisfs
in the digestion and assimilation of the
food â so that the blood gets its elements
from the products of digestion, the liver at
the same time is started into activity and
there is perfect elimination of waste mat-
ter. The grerms of grip, malaria, catarrh
or consumption find a fertile field if the
body is not kept in perfect order and
the blood pure.
Because the stomach is diseased there
is a diminution of the red corpuscles of
the blood. This is why one is sleepless,
languid, nenrous asd irritable. Sensitive
etomachs groan aloud at the irritating cod
liver cils, but they will cet all the food
elements the tissues require by using the
'Golden Medical Discovery."
The "Discovery" is absolutely a .non-
alcoholic ar.d non - narcotic ' medicine.
There is nothing else *"just as good."

OPERATIONS NOT
AIAVAYS NECESSARY
Doctors Frequently Mistaken.
"I suffered untold agohy with piles
for over three years' Two doctors told
me nothing but an operation would cure
me. I tried different remedies, but
nothing did me any good until I used
Pyramid Pile Cure. I bought six 50-cent
boxes at the drug store, an<t now I can
do my work and go out, where before
I spent most of my time lying down. I
thank God for giving the discoverer the
knowledge to make such a cure. I recom-
mend it to all my friends, and if I ever
have piles again will certainly use this
remarkable remedy. You can use this
in any way you wish to make known
the wonderful merit of Pyramid Pile
Cure." Mrs. Wm. Mucky, 81 Marshall
street, Elizabeth, N. J.
The experience of this lady is that of
thousands of others who have been as-
sured that nothing short of an opera-
tion would rid them of this distressing
complaint. On the face of it, it appears
. as if too many surgeons operate in or-
der that they may keep their hand in
and lose no portion of their skill; then,
again, too many surgeons are anxious
to experiment (like the scientific man
In Mark Twain's pathetic story of the
dog and her little puppy), and do not
have proper regard for a patient's phy-
sical welfare or condition.
We advise every sufferer to think
twice before submitting to an operation
for piles, and suggest that those Inter-
ested write to the Pyramid Co.,
Marshall, Mich., for their little book on
the causes and cure of piles, which is
cent free for the asking.

"When a person has been told that
they are in the last stages of consump-
tion, and that no treatment can helD
thÂ»Â»m. it is surely a wonderful relief
both physically and mentally, to find a
treatment that has curative effects My
condition was a very serious one. and
all the medical treatment that I used did
me no good. I heard of the success of
Electro-Chemlstry In serious diseases
like my own. and I went to the Electro-
Chemic Institute, Xo. 118 Grant ave. forv
a careful examination. This examination
was free and it was so thorough that I
had great hopes when the Electro-Chexn-
lc specialists told me that Electro-Chem-
lstry would cure me. I began the treat-
ment Immediately, and in a short time
my condition was greatly Improved in
every way. When I first went to the In-
stitute my breathing was so short that I
could hardly go up the stairs. I had a
very serious cough and I expectorated
horrible looking: matter from my lungs
I had fever in the afternoons and had
night sweats. I had lost a great deal of
flesh and was so weak that I could
scarcely get about. I feel like a new wo-
man now. I feel stronger in every way
The cough has disappeared. The night
sweats and the afternoon fevers have
disappeared. I do not expectorate bad
looking matter from my lungs, and all of
this has been accomplished in a verv
short time and at very little expense I
feel it my duty to tell other sufferers of
the wonderful effects of Electro-Chemls-
try In bad cases like my own. My name
is Mrs. M. Macdougall and I live at No
400 Oak St.. San Francisco.**
It is cures like these that Is making
the Electro-Chemic treatment famous,
and it Is because of such cures that in
less than three years* time the Electro-
Chemic practice in San Francisco has
become the largest special practice in
the West. Electro-Chemlstry is curative
In all long-standing and chronic diseases
and it is the most successful treatment
yet discovered for the cure of Consump-
tion, Catarrh, Bronchitis. Asthma. Deaf-
ness, Ringing Ears. Discharging Ears.

The Electro-Chemic X-Ray Examina-
tion is the most reliable examination that
any sufferer can have and It is absolute-
ly free to all. Patients living at a dis-
tance should try to come to the office for
this examination. In most cases the pa-
tient ran take the course of Electro-
Chemic home treatment and return home
the same day. An expensive Electro-
Chemic apparatus is loaned to outside
patients, free of charge. The Institute
is provided with separate and private
apartments for its male and female pa-
tients and everything is retired, quiet
and pleasant. All classes are now taking
the Electro-Chemic course. There are
lawyers. ministers. priests, physi-
cians, merchants, mechanics, laborers,
and there are society ladles and there are
housewives, all receiving the same care-
ful, conscientious treatment at the hands
of the Electro-Chemic specialists. The
Electro-Chemic Institute is cefttrally lo-
cated at No. IIS Grant ave.. corner of
Post St.. and the office hours are from
nine to five and seven to eight daily, and

had been submitted, involving, heavy
ccst. Dornin said:
"In all the foregoing plans the cost is
greater (in some 'cases' double) what
the people have been educated to be
lieve would be rjecessary to provide a
supply and a system adequate to meet
the . ne*sds of .the city for some little
time to. come. I am > firmly convinced
that if supplemented by a salt water
sprinkling system at moderate cost a
plant can be installed for about $3,000,
000 or $3,250,000,, and It has, been with
that in view that -I have been consist
ently working during the three and. a
half years that I have been a member
of this City Council. ; iffisfe^SfS
"Not until the second day of last
month, however, was I able to gÂ«*t a'
contract or option on the property. I
have had in view, the owners' being
loth to tie up their properries Tor lonj
ie<Tn for the small consideration 1 felt

On the above- date, however, I did suc

In getting an option on the property, the
greatest inducement to the owners to
give me a contract being the prospect
of selling It at a figure far in advance
of any price they could get for it for
any other purpose, but still a figure
far below the value that the Oakland
Water Company places upon its hold
ing at Alvarado.
"And now .for the charges that this
CoubcH has forgotten its pledges, and
is trying to force the city to buy the
Contra Costa plant at $8,000,000 (this
latter an excerpt from Mr. Aitken's
open letter printed in the Enquirer on
September 26), I have to say that, so
far as some of the members are con
cerned, I know the charges to be abso
lutely false and believe the same can
be said of all. I believe all/ that is
necessary to secure the suppurt of the
whole Council is to point out a supply
that is adequate and that can be ac
quired at reasonable cost. Otherwise
it does not meet the requirements of
the platform on which we were elected,
and to which our friends pledged our
hearty support."

TELLS OF HIS OPTION.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Oct. 10.;
At the next meeting of the Board of
Supervisors the Central Supply Com
pany must explain why it has failed to
deliver to the county the 100 Columbia
voting machines which it contracted
last January to furnish. The time for
delivery is long past. Supervisor Rowe
to-day introduced the following reso
lution in regard to the matter:
Resolved, That the said contract made and
entered Into on the 14th of January, 1904, be
tween the said Central Supply Company, a cor
poration, and the county of Alameda, bÂ« and
is hereby declared void and the District Attor
ney of said county is hereby directed to instl
.tute proceedings against the said company and
its bondsmen, the Aetna Indemnity Company,
under. the contract and bond filed with this
board on the above date.
The resolution was referred to a com
mittee of the whole without discussion
and later a motion prevailed to cite the
representatives of the company to . ap
pear and explain why the terms of the
contract had not been complied with.
Rival companies having other ma
chines to place claim the company
handling the Columbia voting machine
is unable to fill the cantract, as it had
never manufactured any large number
of machines. Supervisor John Mitchell,
however, said he had been told that
forty of the machines for this county
were already set up.

Sand Instead of Sawdust.
BERKELET, Oct. 10.- â Coach Hop
per of the varsity team asked for
sawdust and got sand. Sawdust he
desired by the wagonload for use on
the football field, to make the ground
fit for practice and games. Graduate
Manager Ezra Decoto of the Associat
ed Students, denied the request "for
sawdust;* but ordered twelve loads of
sand instead. , Captain Stroud said
sawdust was needed because the team
was losing men from injuries on ac
count of the roughness" of the ground.
Manager Decoto is quoted by R. , W.
Kittrelle, varsity quarterback and
athletic editor of the Occident, as
saying in reply to Stroud: "We can
afford to lose men this year as well
as any other." The entire subject la
exhaustively, discussed by the Occi
dent In Its issue to-day, indicating the
students' feelings. .
Dornin gave a lengthy review of the
work the City Council had done in the
effort to get a municipal water supply,
the obstacles met, and the labor given
for many months to the task. An
ewering charges which he declared had
been made by Councilman Aitken, that
the Council had forgotten its pledges.
President Dornin said:
"This attack, like many others the
same person has made when the sub
ject of his criticisms was absent and
cot in position to renly, comes with
poor grace from one who knows better
end who knows that, with no assist
ance from hml, this Council has been
struggling with might and main, to
cerve the best interests of the city.
It comes with poorer grace from one
who. when repeatedly requested and
challenged to produce a scheme for a
municipal water supply* if he has one.
The sixth and last proposition was
presented by George "W. Dornin, presi
dent of the Council, during the course
of an address. It came as a surprise to
the members in that President Dornin
eaid he had bonded out of his own
pocket a tract of 1000 acres of land, to
cost $150,000, which had shown ex
tensive artesian well possibilities. The
location of the land is not far from
Oakland, as indicated by Dornin's esti
mate of $3,200,000 as the total cost of
purchasing the site and of installing
necessary pipelines and pumping
plants for operation.
President Dornin explained that he
had procured the option on September
S, but had refrained from making It
public before the bond election had
been held, because he feared the cry of
buncombe might be raised. He re
fused to-night to say where the land
was situated, announcing that he pre
ferred to have a report first from the
epecial committee that had been
named to handle the water proposi
tions.
Fourth â Project to purchase water
rights just below the junction of the
north and middle forks of the American
River near Auburn; to dam and form
a lake three miles long and one quarter
mile wide, and supply 60,000.000 gallons
a day through two 48-inch pipes, at an
estimated cost of $3,638,500, with $410,-
S24 additional if 10,000 electrical .horse
power is desired from the *?.me
source. Councilman Edwin Meese of
fered this proposition.
Fifthâ Offer by AL K. Miller to de
velop an artesian well supply in Ala
meda County for $4,000,000. This
project is said to be closely related to
the Is lies Cone plan of withdrawing a
Bupply from the gravel beds in the dis
trict.
DORXTV'S EOOXOMTCAIi PLAX.
Six separate propositions to furnish
the city of Oakland with a municinal
water supply were submitted to-niKht
to the City Council. All of them after
long discussion were given into the
hands of a epecial advisory committee
named ty President George W. Dor
nin on motion of Councilman Edwin
Mecse. This committee is composed of
Mayor Warren Olney. City Engineer
F. C. Turner, Councilman Edwin
Meese end J. T. Wallace, and James K.
Moffitt, Cary Howard and R. H. Cham
berlaJn. The last three are private
citizens. The six projects in "the order
of their presentation are:
Firstâ The Bay Cities Water Com
pany's amended plan, guaranteeing de
livery of 20,000,000 gallons a day to the
city limits at a cost of $3,750,000, the
city to build the necessary reservoirs
end diEtiibutlng plant.
Secondâ M. K. Miller's plan to develop
an underground supply of water in the
city of Oakland, presented by Coun
cilman B. C. Cuvellier at request of the
2Iunic!pal League.
Thirdâ Tender of the Sierra Nevada
Water and Power Company by A. L.
Taylor, president, with reservoir site
and other water rights on the Mokel
timne River at its headwaters in Cala
veras County. 109 miles frim Oakland,
vith a capacity of 17,000,000 gallons.
The company proposes to sell the city
a perpetual right to 32,000,000 gallons a
day. Rough estimates of the cost of
the pipeline to Oakland are $8,000,000
and $4,000,000, according to route. This
plan was presenteQ by Councilman J.
T. Wallace.

reported to the police that he was held
up by two "footpads and robbed of a
gold watch and a $500 diamond ring

en the authorities a description of the
robbers and offered a reward of $100

scribes the footpads as being young
men not more than 23 years of age.

plexion and smooth shaven. The other
was of medium build and of a dark
complexion.

Central.
Notwithstanding the weather the
Central Theater was comfortably filled
on the first presentation of "She" last
night and the auspicious opening as
sures a large attendance during the
week. Particular care has been tak
en by the management to render the
production equal- to the dramatic sit
uations and climaxes that Rider Hag
gard lent to his popular novel. /The
furor that was created by "She" when
the book was placed before the lovers
\)f Haggard's peculiar style of litera
ture was reflected in the audience
that witnessed the dramatization.
Eugenie Thais Lawton returned to
the Central last evening. In the pro
logue, which was staged with striking
effect, she received an 'ovation. A
score of beautiful floral tributes were
handed her in evidence that her re
turn to the Central's playgoers, who
have learned to admire her clever
work, was appreciated.
"She" is a play that will not fall to
please the generality of persons. It is
full of human interest and few of its
lines are dull. The scenic efforts of
the Central fully meet the require
ments of the first and last acts. In
the latter Miss Lawton does her
strongest bit of work. The spurning
of her rival and the assassination were
a well acted climax deserving of the
applause accorded it. "She" is cer
tain to draw crowded houses.

NEW YORK, Oct. 10.â At Madison
square Garden to-night, in the pres
ence of an assemblage never before
equaled at a similar affair in point of
social and financial importance, Harry
Payne Whitney, the eldest son of the
late William C. Whitney, became the
sole owner of the stallion Ha?*Â»burg for
$70,000, and other stallions and mares,
including Sandringham for $14,000;
Hadspun, dam of Tanya, for $22,000,
and Endurance by Right, $16,000. For
ty-one head were sold, the total reach
ing $224,750, an average of $5481. Med
dler was not sold, it being considered
wiser to divide the catalogue into two
parts, reserving Meddler and others
for to-night.
Every foot of space in the mammoth
inclosure was occupied. Men and
women in evening dress were there in
thousands. Prominent among the per
sons present were: Harry Payne Whit
ney and Mrs. Whitney, Pavne Whit
ney, H. B. Duryea and Mrs. Duryea,

In fact, the event partook largely of
the nature of a function, more or less
formal, and when the Whitney and
Duryea parly filed in and took seats in
the front row of the reserved section,
many there were reminded of the sol
emn nature of the affair which made
the sale the most notable in the an

ITALY'S KING
AS A FIREMAN
NEW YORK, Oct. 10.â The finding of
several pounds of bent wire nails
sharpened to a needle point on the
course of the Vanderbilt cup race
where tire of George Arents' auto
mobile exploded has spurred District
Attorney Niemann of Hempstead to
make a searching investigation. It is
believed that few of the tire casualties
in the race on Saturday were purely
accidental, but that many were the re
sult of deliberate intent to wreck the
racers.
The nails were discovered along the
Hempstead turnpike to-day by Herbert
Dodge and Wiliam Morgan. Morgan
stepped upon one hidden in the dust. So
pointed was ithe sliver of wire that it
penetrated the thick Sole of his shoe.
Then several pounds of nails were
found. Half a bushel of fragments of
broken beer bottles were picked up
before the race at Elmont.
Several of the employes are reported
to have had narrow escapes. The lo<:3
will amount to several thousand dol
lars.
AUTO ACCIDENTS
DUE TO VANDALS
LEXINGTON, Oct. 10.â Judge James
M. Mulligan, whose wife and son,
James, have each been accused in
some way with having placed poison
in a plate of salmon which was set
before Mrs. Mulligan and two of her
children two weeks ago, issued to-night
a signed statement in which he exon
erates his wife from* all imputations
and places the entire blame on his son,
James. i
He says he has never once considered
as true the intimation of his son James
on the witness stand that Mrs. Mulli
gan might have placed the poison in
the salmon to cause further estrange
ment between him and his first wife's
children. He says such a theory is
uiifounded and that his favorite son.
James, is the only cause of the trouble-
He declares that except for the fact
that his son has taken advantage of
his silence to try to shift the suspicion
of the public to his wife, he would have
allowed the matter to drop although
he knew that he would be taking des
perate chances.
Judge Mulligan says the negro
Mitchell, who first made the matter
public, is a tool of his son.
The matter is now in the hands of
the grand jury for investigation.

WASHINGTON. Oct. 10. â Brigadier
General Frederick Funston, until re

the Columbia, in his annual report
says that additional observation and
conversation with officers him
In the views expressed in his last re
port that there should be a substantial
increase in the pay of the enlisted men
ol the army. General Funston says:
"There can be scarcely a doubt that
such action would bring into the army
a vastly superior body of men who
would remain in the service. It is
doubtful if an increase over present
rates of pay of 50 per cent for non
eemmissioned officers and 30 per cent
for privates would be more expensive
than under present rates when so
much time and money are wasted in
trying to make soldiers out of the in
ferior class of men who constitute at
least half of the rank and file of the
army to-day."
General Funston says that the con
struction and maintenance of the
Alaskan military line has been of ines
timable value in maintaining com
munication between department head
quarters and the various posts In
Alaska.
MORE PAY FOR
ENLISTED MEN
Roche says â so loth I was to leave
the Greet "Much Ado About Noth
ing" at Lyric Hall in the midst of its
most exquisite fooling. If these Shake
speare performances under Shake
spearean conditions do no more, they
show even more clearly how vital and
intrinsic the charm of the "Joyous
comedies." With a garden seat and a
pair of curtains for scenery, and with
out any particular magnificence of
acting, the illusion of the comedy
gripped one after its first few joyous
words.
One found one's self plotting with the
plotters, railing, laughing, living with
the merry folk in the merry days in
the Messina garden. Is there any
where greater deliciousness of comedy
than the plotting against Benedick's
and Beatrice's peace?
The Greet company bring much if not
sheer greatness to the performance.
Most notable of all is the quality of
distinction in the work. Again for the
sheer vocal beauty of the cast every
round English voice of them is worth
going to hear â the performance is no
table, and the clear, fine enunciation,
the charm of an admirable pronuncia
tion, and something else â possibly a
touch of the Shakespeare flame i' the
blood, in these of Shakespeare's coun
try, make the Greet people ft Shakes
peare something not to be missed.
Ben Greet is a better Benedick than
Hamletâ but still a better Malrolio
than eitherâ as you may see for your
self on Thursday night next. Still he
serves well enough. Mr- Crawley is a
courtly Don Pedro antL uncommonly
good is Mr. Cleeve's Don John. Leonard
Shepherd is convincing as Leonato.
Of course Miss Constance is the Bea
trice, and brings much charm to the
presentment. Herols also charmingly
undertaken by Miss Helena Head and
the rest filled in acceptably. I had the
ur.happiness to miss Mr. Greenstreet's
Dogberry, but hear very good things
of it. The comedy goes to-night and
to-morrow matinee and evening;
"Twelfth Night" for the rest of the
â¢week.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
THE NEW LEADING MAN AND THE LEADING LADY AT THE ALCAZAR THE
ATER WHO OPENED LAST NIGHT IN "LORD AND LADY ALGY" AND
SUCCEEDED IN PLEASING THE LARGB AUDIENCE.
SHANGHAI, Oct. 11. â The British
Minister, Sir Ernst Satow, has notified
the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Af
fairs of an uprising in Tamtngfu and
Changtefu, on the border of Shantung,
Chili and Honan provinces. The up
rising has ten thousand adherents. The

General Ma, military Governor 'of the

Mohammedans are showing symptoms
of rebellion, and that the Russians are
attempting to complicate the situation
by dispatching troops for the protec

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has
entered a protest and has requested
that the Russian troops be recalled. In
the event of a serious protest against
the Anglo-Tibetan treaty it is be

SEEK REFUGE
FROM BOXERS
The new players at the Alcazar â Lil
lian Lawrence, the leading lady; John
Craig, the leading man, and Elizabeth
Woocison, the ingenue â were happily
introduced to the patrons of the house
last night in "Lord and Lady Algy." I
dropped in in the middle of the second
act to find them already well estab
lished In the good graces of the audi
ence. And the audience seemed to
please the players just as well, when
the flowers and yells of their first Cali
lornia welcome went up over the foot
lights.
"Lord and Lady Algy," with its
strongly-lined types and straightaway
story, serves well as a medium for the
newly corralled company. Perhaps it
served particularly well last night. At
least it struck one that the part of
Lord Algy, the loud, good-natured, ag
gressive, honest-hearted racing scion
of the nobility, suited excellently John
Craig's forthright methods. No less
neatly did the role of Lady Algy seem
to fit Miss Lillian Lawrence. But you
never can tell.
Both players come accredited with
large versatility, and their work last
night shows them both accomplished
actors. Next week's "Way of the
World," a society comedy by Clyde
Fitch to be first performed here then,
may develop them quite differently and
as handsomely. But very well went the
play last night, the new and old mem
bers of the company mixing like cof
fee and cream.
The new company, so far as Miss
Lawrence goes, is blonde and hand-
Fome, as blonde and handsome as Adele
Block was brunette and the same. It
is further tall and of impressive mold.
Ftlii further it wears charming gowns.
And throughout her performance the
ectre^s showed the grace and ease of
the considerable experience that has
boen hers. She was, among other
thir.ps, be it mentioned, for almost the
Â¦uhole six years of its history, leading
lady with the Castle Square stock com
pany in Boston. That the larger part
of the time was spent with Mr. Craig
there as leading man goes doubtless
tax 4o explain the smoothness of the
ensemble la.Â«t night. Miss Lawrence's
Lady Alsry was dashing, spirited and
thoroughly likable.
Mr. Craig: is very direct in method,
unfalteringly sure of himself and with
any amount of vim. He is truly the
"leading" man, dominant, even ag
gressively so. He possesses a distinc
tive stape presence and an exception
ally pleasing voice, and one can under-
Ftand his every word. As before re
marked, his Lord Algy was a clever
and convincing portrait, and indeed
Mr. Craig's performance seems to
aujrur an all-around competence.
Miss W'ondson had the role of Mrs.
Brabazon Tudway and rather seemed
to wish she hadn't. The part suits her
ill. apparently, and that is a pity, for
Miss VToodson is a very pretty little
person to suit. Better luck next time
â as Hans says.
Tlio old puard showed up handsome
ly. John B. Maher in the lead with
t>. capital and most taking enactment
of the jockey's role. Harry Hilliard
dc^s juvenile leads better all the time,
this time as Captain Standige. and
George Osbourne, Harry D. Byers.
Harry McAuliffe and Luke Conners all
help. The house was crowded for the
occasion in spite of the rain. Cloud
bursts couldn't keep the Alcazar
clientele away.
I never regretted more than last
right not being a bird â that I might
be in two places at wanst, as Sir Boyle
County Clerk Greif, during the last
few days, has been busily engaged in
the preparation of a document that is
likely to figure prominently in th* trial
of Nan Patterson in New York City for
the murder of Caesar Young, the noted
turfman. The document concerns J.
Morgan " Smith, brother-in-law of the
accused woman, who is badly wanted
by the New York police. By Smith's
evidence the District Attorney of New
York hopes to prove whence came the
pistol with which Young was shot, the
suspicion being that it formerly be
longed to Smith and from him passed
to Nan Patterson.
Smithy and his wife disappeared
shortly after the shooting, and while
the prosecution has been hopeful of
finding him and using him as a witness
it is nevertheless taking every possible
precaution against his turning his evi
dence in favor of the defendant.
A few months before the shooting
Smith was a habitue of the tenderloin
district of San Francisco and figured in
a number of escapades, the most nota
ble of which was his connection with
the will of Max H. Kershaw, a former
resident of New York, who 1 died in a
local 'French restaurant after a long
debauch. After Kershaw's death a will
was produced in court in which the*
former Harvard athlete and well
known Eastern clubman bequeathed
the major portion of his share in his
family estate to a woman who had
been his associate for a number of
months, and who, it was claimed, had
attended him during his last hours of
illness. In the probating of this will,
which was bitterly contested by Ker
shaw's brother, Smith appeared as the
principal witness, he having been pres
ent in Kershaw's room when the will
was executed and affixed his signature
to it as a witness.
During the court proceedings Smith
was subjected to a severe grilling by
the attorneys for the contesting broth
er and much of the disreputable ca
reer in this city was brought to light.
Shortly after the trial Smith received
from some mysterious source a sum of
money, with which he bought a ticket
to New York and hurried East. It is
the testimony in the Kershaw case
that the District Attorney of New York
intends to use should it be found neces
sary to bring to light there the part
played by Smith during his stay in this
city. Tcr obtain this data it was neces
sary for the New York officials to ap
peal to County Cl' " Greif, who fur
nished them with a certified copy of the
testimony in the Kershaw case, which
was forwarded yesterday to New York
City
Fischer's Theater, long the home of
burlesques, dialects, pretty girls and
fancy dancing, will on and after Octo
ber 24 be the home of musical " farce
comedy. The reason given for the
change is the withdrawal of Rice and
Cady, the German dialect comedians,
and Bobby North, the successor of
Barney Bernard in Hebrew'imperson
ations, who are under contract to ap
pear at the Aldin, a new theater in
Pittsburg that will be devoted to bur
lesques of the Weber-Fieldian type.
The Pittsbvjrg management, in look
ing about for tall and short Dutchmen,
found that there was a scarcity of that
kind of professional talent. In fact,
the only ones insight appeared to be
Rice and Cady. who were nishtly pleas
ing San Franciscans at Fischer's. Ne
gotiations were immediately started,
with the result that Rice and Cady
have given two weeks' notice, and will
soon appear at the new PittsburE house.
Right on top of this came the two
weeks' notice of Bobby North, who
having heard of the plans of Rice and
Cady immediately communicated with
the Pittsburg people with the result
that he, too, will soon open at the
Pittsburg theater.
Just what will become of the re
mainder of the Fischer company is
uncertain. Miss Dorothy Morton
should prove as great an attraction in
musical farce as in burlesque, and the
same may be said of John Dillon. With
the adoption of musical farce the
Fischer chorus will be a thins of Jhe
past. The change will take place Octo
ber 24, and will be permanent.

Well This Evidence,
Proof of merit lies in the evidence.
Convincing evidence in San Fran-

Is not the testimony of strangers,
But the indorsement of San Fran-

That's the kind of proof given
here â
The statement of a San Francisco
citizen.
Mrs. W. Heine (VV. Heine em-
ployed in the Examiner) of 3007
Fillmore street, says: "It is impos-
sible for me to say too much in fa-
vor of Doan's Kidney Pills. I have
the best of reasons for this. I suf-
fered from an attack of kidney
trouble in the winter of 1902, caus-
ing pain across the small of my back
and down through the loins. It
finally grew so bad that I could
scarcely turn or move without en-
during a most agonizing twinge, and
often as the pangs shot across my
back I almost exclaimed. Just be-
fore I used Doan's Kidney Pills I
was so helpless that for two days I
couid only get about the house with
the aid of a cane. There must be
some merit in Doan's Kidney Pills,
for they gave immediate relief. A
short course of the treatment
stopped -that particular attack. I
now know what to do should others
recur."

she was cured of backache, dizziness, pain-
ful and irregular periods by the use of
Lydia E. Pinkriam's Vegetable Compound*.
"Dear Mrs. Pinkham: â Gratitude compels me to acknowledge the
great merit of your Vegetable Compound. I have suffered for four years
Â¦with irregular and painful menstruation, also dizziness, pains in the back
and lower limbs, and fitful sleep. I dreaded the time to come which
would only mean suffering to me.
" Better health is all I wanted, and cure if possible. Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Compound brought me nealth and happiness in a
few short months. I feel like another person now. My aches and pains
have left me. life seems new and sweet to me, and everything seems
pleasant and easy.
"Six bottles brought me health, and was worth more than months
under the doctor's care, which really did not benefit me at all. I am sat-
isfied there is no medicine so good for sick women as your Vegetable
Compound, and I advocate it to my lady friends in need of medical
help. âMrs. B. A. Bianchard, 422 Broad St., Nashville, Tenn.

An ordinance was presented to the
Board .of Supervisors by Supervisor
Comte at yesterday's meeting repeal
ing the existing ordinance which per
mits the buying and selling of pools
and the making of bets upon races be
tween dogs for a period of sixty days
in one calendar year.
Comte said he had been Informed
on good authority that the coursing
park was not conducted as it should
be. Children were permitted to gam
ble on the matches, the doga were
"doped" and other irregularities were
practiced. The matter was referred to
the joint committee on Police and Ju
diciary for a report.
The board directed the chief of the
Department of Electricity to prepare
plans for 'a permanent underground
conduit system for the wires and pipes
used in supplying the city with water,
light, heat, power and other service.
The board proposes to make provision
for the establishment of such a system
and thereby prevent the tearing up
and injury of accepted streets, as la
now practiced.
Seldom has San Francisco contained
bo many long-haired men as are now
within her borders. From the "nature
man" down to the banjoist who sells
oil and corn remedies, there is the
widest range of shaggy-headed deni
zens In raiment of eccentric color and
cut.
Strangers notice the peculiarity and
wonder whether lt is a custom of the
country for men to desert the barber.
L.ee J. Vance, editor of the American
Wine Press, yesterday said:
On one corner I heard a Ions-haired man
talk socialism. Half a block away a fellow
with long auburn hair called himsÂ«lf a profes
sor of mineralogy and tried to sell me mining
stock. Within half an hour I met a booted
and bespangled chap with the air of an Indian
scout, another with flaxen hair and light
clothes who might bÂ« called the dud* of th*
womanish aggregation. San Francisco's long
haired men are certainly plentiful. Next to
Chinatown. I should fay, they are your moat

NEW YORK, Oct 10.â Boston van
quished Now York on the baseball field
here to-day, winning the American
L'-sguf championship pennant for the
second time. It was a sensational fin
ish to a thrilling struggle which has
been going on for several months and
though Boston won the New York rop
r< tentative? were not disgraced. In
fact they almost shared the honors
with tht victors. For ihe last two
Pk4mns these teams have been seesaw
ing in the lead for the championship,
and the fact that the issue narrowed
down to the outcome of to-day's dou
ble-header on the Washington Heights
grounds demonstrates how close the
battle was. In order to win the pen
r.int Griffith's New Yorks required
two victories to-day, whiie Boston only
needed one. At the end of the fifth
Inning the local men seemed to have
the first game well in hand, as they
had scored two runs.
In the seventh inning a bad throw
by Williams to the plate allowed La-
Chanre and Ferris to the plate
and tie the score for Boston. Each
eide being equal things went smoothly
until the first half of the ninth Inning
when Criger reached first safely on
en infield hit. Dineen advanced him
CD second by a sacrifice, and Chesbro
at this critical stage made a wild pitch,
the ball hitting the press stand, while
Criper was running in with the win
ning run. New York failed to offset
the advantage which Boston had gain
ed, and the game and the pennant
went to the New England team by a
store of 3 to 2.
More than 28.000 persons were within
the inclosure when the victory was
V- on. The scene which ensued will not
be forsotten easily by any of those who
v ere present.
Putimann and Winter were the op
posing pitchers in the final game, which
Tvent the full nine innings without a
run being scored. A wild throw by
LaChance gave Conroy the looked for
opportunity to tally in the tenth in

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 10.â In a
whirlwind fight that was scheduled to
go six rounds at Industrial Hall to

lon so badly beaten that the police
stopped the contest in the fourth round.
At the time the city authorities inter
fered the former champion was raining
blows on the prostrate form of Hanlon,
who was hanging on the ropes.
The contest was a terrific one. Up
to the fourth round McGovern had a
shade the better of it. In the fourth
Hanlon, seeing an opening, sent a left
hook hard to the chin and the former
champion went down for the count and
to many of the spectators it looked as
though McGovern was out of lt. Han
lon, however, threw discretion to the
wind and tried to put in a finishing
blow. He fought so recklessly that it
proved his downfall, McGovern going
at him so viciously that almost before
the spectators realized it he had the
Californian helpless.
In the first round each man slugged
with both hands, during which Mc-
Govern hooked his left to the neck and
sent ln two uppercuts, making Hanlon
break ground. McGovern uppercut
Hanlon with a right and then hooked
a hard left to the Californian's chin.
McGovern followed this up with a right
and left swing to the head and Han
lon retaliated by putting four straight
lefts to McGovern's face and a right
swing to the head as the bell rang.
McGovern started off with a rush in
the second. He sent a left to the face,
a left and right uppercut to the jaw
and a right and left swing to the body,
but as he delivered the last blow he
caught a swinging right hook on the
chin. Hanlon followed this up with
two lefts to the face and a hard right
swing to the chin. McGovern got in two
hard right uppercuts to the chin and
received a left hook on the jaw in re
turn.
Both men took things easy at the
opening of the third round. McGovern
landed three hard swings on the jaw,
but Hanlon fought him back and made
Terry clinch. A rapid exchange "of
blows was followed by Hanlon giving
McGovern a severe left uppercut to the
chin, which staggered McGovern. Mc-
Govern instantly recovered and sent
left and right to the face and repeated
the punches. They exchanged right
swings to the jaw as the bell rang.
McGovern came to the center of the
ring in the fourth round appearing a
little weak. Terry swung his left and
right to the jaw and then Hanlon
floored McGovern with a left swing to
the chin. McGovern took the count of
nine. He clinched when he got on his
feet and was nearly out. He made a
quick recovery, however, and rained
blows on Hanlon and soon had him on
the ropes. The Californian went down
from the effect of right and left swings
to the Jaw and as soon as he got up
Terry put him on the ropes, where he
hammered him into almost a helpless
condition. Hanlon's hands were down
and he was helpless. A terrific right
arm swing put him in a prostrate con
dition on the ropes and all but out. At
this point the police interfered and
stopped the contest.

MORRIS PARK, N. Y., Oct. 10. â In
spite of forbidding looking tracks, the
racing was good, the finish in the
VTestchester handicap, the flfth race on
the card, being particularly close, and
while the judges awarded It to Collec
tor Jessup, there would have been no
objection from the crowd if Wotan had
re-ceived the decision. There were
many who criticized the confident
manner in which Travers rode Wotan,
his style being much like that dis
played by W. Davis a few days ago
when his mount, Ormonde's Right,
won on one of those "heart disease"
rides which Shaw and Fuller were
wont to display.
Others, however, thought that Trav
ers rode an admirable race, timing his
run to a nicety and probably expecting
to see Collector Jessup coming back.
SIcGinnis' colt was under the whip for
more than a quarter mile and Trav
ers probably thought that no ordinary
horse could survive such punishment.
The Westchester handicap won by Col
lector Jessup was worth $1760 to his
owner, who has won back both in
stakes and bets much more than the
gallant little colt originally cost. The
running of Leonidas was extremely
disappointing." It is possible that he
did not like the going.
x Lady Uncas had all her old speed
and Collector Jessup did not have her
beat until the last furlong.

PATRICK CARROLJj NE^VR
DROWNING IX THE BAY
Falls From Boat and Is WIOi Difflcul
\ ty Saved by His Companion,
Albert* Ames.
Patrick Carroll and Albert Ames
about 6 o'clock last evening left Lom
bard wharf in a Whitehall boat, to en-
Joy a few hours* fishing on the bay.
Soon after getting away from the shel
ter of the dock the young men ran into
rough water, and aB neither under
stood handling the boat they found its
management a task beyond them. The
boat was almost overturned and Car
roll was thrown Into the water. The
current rapidly carried him away, and
Ames with the oars tried to pick him
up. Carroll kept afloat and Ames in
an awkward way stuck manfully to the
work of rescue.
Finally, when Carroll was sinking,
the boat was urged alongside and
Ames was able to catch and hold the
drowning man on the surface till he
(Ames) could collect himself. With a
great effort he pulled the helpless Car
roll Into the boat, almost filling lt with
water 1 as he did so. Ames succeeded
in getting , the boat ashore, and his
companion soon recovered from his
plunge and his close call from drown
ing. Carroll iÂ» a laborer and â¢ lives at
361% Seventh street. Ames, who is a
candy-maker, lives at 341 Stevenson
street.
MEMPHIS, Oct- 10.â Lou Dillon, the
world's champion trotting mare, own
ed by C. K. Billings, broke all workout
records for trotting horses to-day by
circling the course at the Memphis
Driving Park in 2:01%. Mlllard Saun
ders, her trainer, drove the mare. She
was paced by a runner driven by Doc
Tanner. The fractional time was:
Quarter, :30; half. 1:00; three-quarters,
1:29%; mile. 2:01%.
The former workout record of 2:02
was held by Lou Dillon and established
at Cleveland September 38 of this year.
No wind shield was used.
Young Corbett has been heard from.
He accuses Britt of being afraid to
meet him. Britt contends that he ts
only evening-up an old score on the
man from Denver.
The defeat of Eddie Hanlon by Terry
McGovern at Philadelphia last nlsht
about closes the career of one of the
most popular boxers California has
ever produced. Two knockouts in suc
cession show that Hanlon has lost hia
stamina, and the severe beatings he
received have had their effect. Han-
Ion's career as a fighter has been sen
sational. Starting as a mere youth he
gained his way to the front until he
came within an ace of defeating th<*
champion. His chief stock was bulldog
tenacity, and he won many battles
through it.
"Whether Jimmy Britt and Joe Gars
will fight this month is a question per
plexing the sporting world. There are
many obstacles in the way and they
may prevent the match. Manager Cof
froth has guaranteed the boxers that
he will pull the bout off in this city this
month. He haa not yet received the
peimlt, but he is sanguine enough of
getting It to post a forfeit. Thf-n an
other dark house is in the road. "Pana"
Britt, who is In the East, has been
heard to say that if his son Â«vf r agreed
to fight a colored man he would per
sonally see that the prizenght was
stopped.
Britt ia at his summer home In San
Mateo. He will leave that place in a
few days and take training quarters
at the Seal Rock House. Gans has not
made lightweight limit In several years.
Whether he can make the weight and
retain his strength is causing much
comment. His manager will select
training quarters where the climate is
warm, so that it will eliminate the
drudgery in getting to 133 pounds at
ringside.
Two well-known sporting men
wagered a few hundred dollars on the
contest. They bet at even money, which
indicates that the betting will be nearly
even.

The field got away in one of Starter
Murray's bad efforts, with Ethylene in

position till well Into the stretch, where
the Prince forged ahead and appeared)
a winner up to the last stride. The

Cadwalader came from Pomona Col

based his protest on the clause of the
agreement between the two universi
ties, which states that ."no player com
ing from a college of standing shall
be eligible to any athletic team until
one year after his matriculation." This
rule was made to prevent the coast
universities from drafting Eastern
players. But in the 'past the rule has
been loosely interpreted, and if a
freshman came from a college where
he was merely registered in the prep
aratory department, he was allowed to
compete without question.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Oct. 10.
Colonel G. C. Edwards, chairman of
the athletic committee of the Univer
sity of California, haa withdrawn hia

Newport News, Va., July 22, 1903.
Last summer while recovering from ill-
ness of fever, I had a severe attack of â¢
Inflammatory Rheumatism in the knees,
from which I was unable to leave my
room for several months. I was treated
by two doctors and also tried different
kinds of linaments and medicines which
seemed to relieve me from pain for
awhile, but at the same time I was not
any nearer getting well. One day while
reading a paper I saw an advertisement
of S. S. S. for Rheumatism. I decided
to give it a trial, which I did at once.
After I had taken three bottles I felt a
great deal better, and I still continued
to take it regularly until I was. entirely
cured. I now feel better than for years,
and I cheerfully recommend S. S. S. to
any one suffering from Rheumatism.

Coroner Leland held an inquest yes
terday upon the body of Ida Allsop, a
14-year-old girl. Ida died in this
city on SeDtember 6 from injuries re
ceived in an accident at Tacoma
while "looping the loop" inside a hol
low sphere.
Mrs. M. Allsop of 217 Harriet
street, mother of the girl, testified that
she had leased her daughter to J.
Collins for a season of six weeks in
ucrobatic performances. The mother
was to receive $Â£ for each perform
ance, but Collins had not paid her
anything. She had been informed
that the accident . happened at the
Mardi-gras grounds in Tacoma
through neglect of the men whose
duty it was to catch in a net the
sphere containing the child after the
performance of the loop. The sphere
missed the net and fell about ten
feet, jarring the girl's spine.
As no direct evidence was presented
the jury were unable to fix the re
sponsibility for the death.

School Directors Boyle and Altmann
of the Board of Education made a
joint visit to the cosmopolitan schools
yesterday afternoon, and as a result
of their visit will recommend that a
separate class be started for the in
struction of crown Italian children
who are not able to speak English.
The law provides that scholars in
the first grade primary may only stay
in that grade a year. This places at
a disadvantage many Italian children
who come to this country at the age
of nine or ten and enter the primary
grades with American children of five
or six years of age. A proposition will
also be submitted to the board to al
low children to remain a year and a
half in the first primary grade if
necessary. In some of the schools
fully 90 per cent of the pupils are of
Italian parentage.

Every vessel that gets up from the Horn
tells of rough weather and high rolling seas
around that tempestuous point. The Dig
steamer California, which recently arrived here,
logged seven days of fierce warfare with a
Cape Horn etorm, and the British ship Strath
don. Caotaln Patterson, which came In yes
terday. 134 days from Swansea, encountered
the same gale, and for a week fought her way
through and out of the stormy zone. The
French bark La Pelier. which arrived in port
148 days from Hamburg, brings the same re
port of h^avy weather at the Horn. The
Strathdon spoke the French Madeline October
3. bound for San Francisco. Near the Horn
the La Pelier saw a strange ship with main
yard gone and other indications of hard
weather In damaged rigging. The name of
the vessel could not be learned, but the sig
nal letters she displayed were J W K B.
Rough Weather at Horn.
Besides H. E. Floyd and Amon G.
Carter, whose diamond studs were
stoien by J. W. Thornton, alias George
Wilson, the Eastern pickpocket, D. W.
Baylor, proprietor of a restaurant at
Â£0 O'Farrell street, comes forward as
another victim. He identified Thorn
ton yesterday as the man who stole
his diamond rtud, valued at $350.
That makes three charges of grand
larceny against Thornton. It was
about the some time that Joseph Har
vey's diamond stud was stolen and
Saylor believes that Thornton was the
thief. Harvey's stud was returned for
a consideration. An application for
a writ of habeas corpus for Thornton's
release was denied by Judge Lawlor
yesterday morning.
Thornton Has Many Victims.
Captain Davison of the British ship Alice A.
Letch is making strenuous efforts to get to sea
and down to Newcastle fcr a load of coal, but
so far a malignant little cherub sitting up
aloft won't let him out of this harbor. Several
days ago his anchors down In the bay got afoul
of each other and he could not unmoor ship.
Yesterday, the mudhooks at last clear, he made
preparations for another start. This time it
was the members of the new crew that fouled.
About half of the men are A. B.'s and of
course know the rude touch of a marlin spike
from the soft cares* of a kid glove, and the
rest know more about sawmills and broncos
than of a reef-tackle. The 'â¢farmers'* con
cluded that the princely and luxurious life of
the jwllor as pictured by the water front board
ing-house runners was too rich for their sim
ple tastes and decided to go ashore and home.
The able-bodied portion of the crew, who know
that such Inexperienced shipmates make double
work for the experienced, abetted the spirit of
desertion by threatening to break the rustic
heads the moment they all got to sea. If not
before. So insubordination is rampant on board
the Alice A. Leigh and she cannot get away
lor Newcastle.

G. H. WILLSON, Local Forecaster,
Temporarily in Charge.
The witness made several efforts, and
finally the agent told him he would
fix the ticket so that if he wanted to
go to St. Louis the ticket would be
handed to the conductor when he got
on the train. "I declined to be sent
that way." said Holzhausen. Mr.
Shortridge accompanied him to the
office on one occasion, and the agent
again declined to validate the paste
board. * , _ t
L. F. Beyreiss, the validating official,
was called and testified that he had
refused to validate the ticket as stated,
except under the condition that Holz
hausen should first board the train and
the ticket should be handed to the con-,
ductor.
A further hearing of the contempt
proceedings against Ticket Broker T.
A. Rigdon was had yesterday morn
ing in Judge Murasky's department,
and the Judge announced that he
woufd decide to-morrow as to the ad
missibility of the Chicago affidavits
as evidence tending to relieve Rigdon
from responsibility in the transaction
relating to the Smith ticket. Attorney
Shortridge said that if the affladvlts
were not admitted he would take depo
sitions of the Chicago witnesses.
Three witnesses were put on the
stand by Mr. Shortridge yesterday for
the purpose of proving that the railroad
companies depart from the printed re
strictions on their tickets, and that
their own agents advise purchasers to
sell the unused portions of tickets to
other persons. Attorney Foshay Wal
ker objected to all of the questioning
on this line. /
John Webber testified that on August
27, at Chicago, he went to the Chicago
and Northwesetrn office to buy tickets
to San Francisco. He told the agent
that he thought he would wait until
the middle of September and take ad
vantage of the cheap excursion rates;
The agent, he says, urged him to buy
the excursion tickets then and told
him that he could sell the return por
tions here. In order that it might
not be difficult to counterfeit his name,
he was advised, he said, to sign "J.
Webb," which he did. He also signed
for his wife and son. Mr. Walker here
admitted that it was 'the common prac
tice for members of families to sign
for others in a family for whom tick
ets were bought. Thereupon Mr.
Shortridge declared that the Smith
ticket was signed in Chicago by some
one authorized by Smith's sister to
sign his name.
Rudolph Holzhausen of St. Louis had
a similar experience. He went to the
Burlington office at St. Louis, intend
ing to buy a one-way ticket to San
Francisco. The agent induced him to
buy a round-trip excursion ticket, tell
ing him that It would be easv to dis
pose of the return portion here. Holz
hausen signed the ticket "R. Holz." He
decided to return to St. Louis and took
the ticket to the Southern Pacific office
at New Montgomery street to have it
validated, but the agent refused to val
idate it, giving as his excuse that he
believed Holzhausen was going to sell
It to a broker.

Witnesses in Eigdon Case
Say They Signed Abbrevi
ations for a Purpose
Three-quarters of a million acres
oi Forest* hsvÂ« been swept by forest
Xires during the last few months. This
has l*d the California Water and
Forest Association to work for better
conditions. At the close of the con
ference of yesterday it was announced
that the outlines of a plan had been
agreed upon, which it is hoped that
the California Legislature will accept
at its next session. The outlines are
simple. It is proposed to have the
Governor appoint a State Forester at a
salary of $2000 a year. The State For
ester is to appoint his assistant, who
will Vie known as the fire warden.
These two officials will be the heads of
the State's forest fire department.
The plan also provides that there
shall be deputy wardens, ten in num
ber, each of whom is to receive $1000
a year. The appointment of the dep
uty wardens will rest with the Gov
ernor of the State and his official as
sociates on the State Board of Ex
aminers. The term of office of the
State Forester is to be for life or dur
ing g-ood behavior. The Forester's
assistant is to be appointed by the
Forester. The committee believes that
the fire preventing and fire extinguish
ing department can be maintained at
a cost of not mor than $30,000 a year.
It is recommended that the pro
posed law shall authorize the deputy
wardens to call upon citizens to help
put out fires and provide compensation
at 25 cents per hour and a penalty
for refusing to give the assistance. The
recommendations will be embodied in
a legislative bill after due considera
tion by the executive committee of the
osooiation.
The organization of a State forest
fire department to prevent and extin
guish foroFt fires in California will be
recommended by a special committee
of the California Water and Forest As
sociation. William Thomas chairman.
Ali day Sunday the committee coun
seled with representatives of the Unit
ed States Bureau of Forestry. Yester
day the conference Mas resumed. Sev
eral leading: conclusions were reached
relative to the proposed fire organiza
tion.

"If a body kiss a body, need a body cry?" Yet they say that
the Republicans are going to lose Montana because one of the State
Senators of that breezy commonwealth indulged in some surrepti
tious osculation at the expense of one of her fair daughters.
For her Womanish folly she paidâ first'
with her princely throne, and then with
her fair, queenly head.
What satisfaction can there be to a
girl who is gentle born and tenderly
matured to see any man with a barb
In his heart through her fault, "like a
deer at the end of the chase?" How
can she rest without self-reproaches if
she knows that through her vanity the
night is long to one who loves her, as
he listens to the many hours come and
go, and come and go relentlessly?
And in nine cases out of ten, when
a man's life is embittered through
love, the girl whom he loved is direct
ly to blame. No man is warranted
fireproof; and she who touches the
match to the loose lumber which is
lying around in a young fellow's imag
ination, gathered there for his castle
in Spain, is responsible for the con
flagration that ensues even* if she did
mean no harm, but did it in careless
mood, just to see what would happen.
Of course there are thousands of
sophistries which may be offered in
her defense. Nature has endowed her,
perhaps, with a manner which seems
to imply so much more than she is
willing to say. Or she has naturally a
smile so personal that every man who
sees it is sure that it is intended for
him alone. She may assert that never
once since the beginning of her ac
quaintance with her luckless lover has
she thought of the possibility of their
ever becoming nearer than "Just
friends." *
"\ But let whoever pleases believe this.
The first proposal that a girl re
ceives may actually be, as she de
clares it is, "so sudden." But the same
is never true again. It takes .wonder
fully little experience to make a wom
an weatherwise in love. She is never
surprised by it a second time.
Both what a man does, and what he
fails I to do, in his relations with her,
confess his preference long before his
words do. Besides, a man In love rare-
George Meredith, whose novels deal
with English high life, lives simply.
He built himself a house not long ago.
It was charming, but small.
- A young woman with, a letter of In
troduction visited Mr. Meredith as his
home was being completed. With
some pride he showed her over the
building, but she, a little disappointed,
said: 4
'.'In your books you describe huge
castles and spacious baronial halls,
but when you come to build you put
up a little bit of a house like this.
Why Is it?" '
"It <is because," replied the poet,
"words are cheaper, than stones."

ly makes an effort at concealment. If
he believes that the great passion of
life has come to him he is proud of
the fact, and, like Heine's lover, he
would, if he could, grasp the highest
pine from the mountains of Norway,
and dip it into the fires of Vesuvius,
that he might. .write with it all over
the earth, "I love.thee!"
According to European standards
the American . girl is notably a flirt.
Such a part as this one is in keeping
with the irresponsible career with
which she is credited by the world
abroad, and which has been likened to
the "undulatory, capricious flight of
birds."
Yet this role is not In accordance
with the ideal of womanhood to which
her countrymen swear allegiance. Gen
erally speaking, she may be, as it is
claimed, in matters of love, mistress of
the situation. Yet mentally, morally,
hers is a lofty heritage. And, morally,
mentally, hers is a great opportunity.
Where the standards of life are high,
so, too, are the standards of love. As
said that women poet, whose sonnets
from the Portuguese are classics in the
literature of love:
"Whoever lives true life will love true
love."

He Loves His Boy.
I believe my boy's without alloy upon
his diaphragm.
And can't be smudged by any officious
kind of man;
And whether it rains, hails or snows
He can stand all climatic changes.
For his blood Is rich with red corpuscles.
Which nothing ever deranges.
He's got his blood from his own papa.
His good mother aiding much
In giving him his present status.
And such and such and such.

It Is to be a season of glitter, and the
manufacturer is on hand with no end
of jetted and spangled trimmings, lace
and robes.
Here are the questions which are
agitating the fashionable world and
which will noj be answered until the'
final fall styles are launched: The fate
of the long basque for bodices; the de
cree as to extenders for the bottoms
of skirts: the height of the bust line
and Its consequence among the corset
makers, and the sleeve and shoulder
mandates, savs the New York Sun.
Early in the spring basqued bodices
put in an appearance, but as yet they
have had little favor, except in circles
of the ultra-fashionable. Coat tails,
indeed, have been seen, but as yet they
are classed by conservatives with the
spectacular. Skirts have diminished in
breadth. Instead of. widening. That i3,
they are narrower at the top, and with
the preference for walking-length tail
or-mades are less unwieldy at the
hems. Few skirts that are bouffant
on the hips appear, even In evening
gowns. All, practically, are shirred,
tucked or plaited and held in leash
nearly or quite to knee depth. This,
of course, does not include gauzes or
the thinnest silks. But, as yet, the
ugly, hunchy effects seen in the spring
on cloth skirts, which were full clear
to the waistband, have not been In
evidence in Incoming models. It has
been a matter of surprise to many that
the hip yoke has again appeared in
tailor-mades. But such Is a fact, or
a:, effect, in some of the smartest mod
e,ls. But the hip yoke is less pro
nounced than it was two or three sea
sons ago and Is far less used.
There Is less talk about the crinoline
than there was in the spring. It is a
matter of congratulation to women
who clamor for a minimum of weight
in their toilets that the silk under
skirts that have just come from the
other side have no interlinings of hair
cloth and no reeds or wires In the
hems, as it was predicted they would
have this fall.
The raising of the bust line and the
increasing vozue of close-fitting bod
ices that show the lines of the figure
is responsible for a host of new ma
nipulations and treatments. There are
no darts, the material being drawn and
draped over a fitted lining, but this is
accomplished in divers ways.
Surplice effects are seen on many of
the new blouses and in conjuction with
them are pretty ribbon and velvet in
troductions. Waistcoat suggestions
are common in the use of two or three
wide folds of velvet, which shade from
dark to light or combine contrasting
tones. These fill in crossed fronts and
leave V-shaped openings at the top to
be filled with lace. On a model from
Paris -there is a novel arrangement
in two straps of velvet" which cross
the broad lace yoke and are caught in
the middle by a big gilt and jeweled
ornament of barbaric design.
â¢Colored embroideries, preferably . of
Oriental design and coloring, are In
troduced â¢ everywhere. They appear
oftener as little touches of brilliance
in insets than in entire vests, cuffs ana
collars. 'Gold braid lights up many a
ravishing toilet of either silk or lace.
For if stories once gain circulation
about a girl's heartlessness, or a girl's
indiscretion, the subject of them is
watched, by eyes sharper than those
of a Â§quirrel after nuts, for any evi
dences of conscious guilt.
When the flirt is unhappy, pride must
buoy her up. She must laugh down the
pain in her bosom, though her breath
comes so short that It hurts her. She
must keep bright the light of her eyes,
though sunlight looks dim to their
vision. She must keep a smile on her
lips, though, unguarded, they tremble.
She must make her life one tiresome
succession of poses.
Few girls count the cost when they
begin the merry sport of flirtation. It
looks like good fun to drive a mascu
line four-in-hand. It is exhilarating to
feel the 'spirit of a force stronger than
yourself quiver along the lines that
you hold in your slender fingers. It is
intoxicating to see every one whom
you pass turn to look after you. Yes,
the whole experience acts on the blood
like wine.
The "morning head" Is quite another
thing, however, especially if you have
to go about your business as if nothing
were the matter. And you are pretty
certain to have it sooner or later.
I doubt If there was ever yet a
woman flirt who' did not pay high for
her triumphs. . Take for an illustrious
example Mary Queen of Scotsâ whom
Maurice Hewlltt thus describes in "The
Queen's Qualr": "She meant no harm,
but she must always bewitch some
thing, girl or boy, poet or little dog."

â¢HPHE girl who flirts does not dare

multitude pointing at her tears, says
Dorothy Fenimore in the Chicago
Journal.
in favor of peace because we are prepared for war, but have no
desire or occasion for it except it be defensive. The nations under
such circumstances will not question our good faith and will hear
and heed us. When the Czar spoke for peace his plans were all laid
for overrunning, in Eastern Asia, a people incapable of resistance.
AH that he had to do was to move into their territory, occupy and
possess it entirely, peaceably! His plea for peace was as insincere
as the deceptive and faithless diplomacy by which he kept his armies
on Chinese territory after agreeing with the concerted powers to
evacuate.. ; Â»
It is unfortunate for The Hague court that it originated in the
'hypocrisy of that autocrat. Under the circumstances it is natural
that St. Petersburg is sullen and angry because Presidont Roose
velt will call another peace conference that will purge the movement
of the poison of bad faith which it derived from the Czar. If the
conference he called had resulted in general disarmament he
would by this time be the autocrat of all Eastern Asia. Japan put no
faith in his peaceful professions and with patient industry and
matchless skill prepared for a struggle for existence. When Russia
is thoroughly whipped and humiliated and all her bad faith is ex
piated with compound interest, the way will be open for universal
peace, and not before.
Mr. Foster not only lays himself open to the charge of unpa
triotism, but to that of advising a course fatal to the very policy
he advocates. The nations he represents instead of building a navy
hire an attorney. It is cheaper for them arid more profitable for
him. But he must look to his own country, to its navy and its
power, to make real the good dream of general peace.
Meantime Mr. Foster should be careful not to encourage the
dynamiting of our warships that are being built.
solve that doubt in favor of his clients.
Every real American knows that without our navy our voice
would not be heard anywhere in the world, no matter how much
we might plead for peace and the disarming of the nations. Natur
ally the advocate of disarmament must have something of whieffto
disarm, otherwise it is a laughing stock.
When our navy is the strongest in the world we will be heard
AT the universal congress of lawyers and jurists at St. Louis, Mr.
John W. Foster made the leading address on arbitration. In
this he deprecated the statement by Secretary Morton in favor
of a navy equal to the greatest in the world, trusting that the Sec
retary had been misquoted. Mr. Foster said; "Our Government
should hold itself in readiness to enter into an agreement for inter
national disarmament, and not to the increase of the navy. This
country should hold itself to other and far more peaceful pursuits
in the settlement of strife than to the making' of implements of de
struction and death."
Mr. Foster has been for many years the attorney for Mexico
and China at Washington and is a diplomat and international lawyer
of eminence. It has been remarked of him for several years that
his view of international relations has been tinged by the condition
and interests of his clients, rather than by the needs and position
of his own country. Neither Mexico nor China has a navy. - They
are defenseless at sea. Universal peace, desirable for all nations, is
especially desirable for them, but they are entirely without influence
in advancing it. It is the hawk and not the hen that can make peace
effective.
If the United States had a sea power equal to all the rest of the
world combined, it could dictate the disarmament of every other
nation and then would disarm itself. When this and another, or
more nations, between which there is amity, but whose combined
navies unite a sea power that nothing can resist, decide for peace,
there will be peace, and not before. Mr. Foster, led by his profes
sional employment, has been in the habit of criticizing the power
of his own country, until it has been doubted whether his allegiance
runs to his country or his clients. This last criticism seems to re-

IT is not the fault of Tom Watson if any doubt as to Populist
opinions prevail in the public mind. He has now given his
views to the world at a somewhat tiresome length but with a
\ igor â we might perhaps say a recklessness â which leaves no room
for ambiguity. Mr. Watson has seen visions and dreamed dreams,
but the hysteria which they have induced is not likely to be serious
ly nor extensively contagious. We are forced to the conviction
cither that he is himself unaware of the conditions prevailing
throughout the country and the world, or that he is trying to trade
upon an assumed ignorance on the part of those whom he ad
dresses.
His efforts to establish a comparison between the Hindus of
India or the oppressed serfs of some European countries upon the
one hand, and the citizens of the United States upon the other, may
commend itself to his own followers, but to the bulk of the nation
it will seem to be only grotesque and pitiable. Or are these illus
trations furnished to us merely as horrible examples of the condi
tion into which we ma}' fall unless we incline our hearts to Mr.
Watson and open our ears to Populist blandishments? Mr. Wat
son's opinions of Judge Parker are of course interesting because they
are so domestic, and when we have been similarly favored with
Tudgc Parker's opinion of Mr. Watson we shall have "a remarkable
object lesson in family candor. V
A manifesto of this nature would be extremely mischievous if
it were addressed to a nation more inflammatory than the American.
As it is the firebrand will be instantly quenched in the cold water
of common sense and sanity. Mr. Watson deplores class hatred
and he does his utmost to arouse it ; he denounces greed while call
ing attention to the opportunities for . pillaging the property of
others : he points out imaginary cracks in the social edifice and he
proposes to mend them by dragging down the whole fabric about
our ears. Inasmuch as the millennium is not yet in sight there
are still weak places in human nature and defects in social organi
zation, but the remedies prescribed by Mr. Watson are far worse
than the disease.
If we had any doubts whatever of the Republican faith that is
in us the manifesto of the Populist candidate would remove them.
The picture which he draws of President Roosevelt is in the main
the picture of the kind of man who would most adorn the Presi
dential office and steer the national ship into ever smoother waters.
We are told that "Roosevelt is a straight cut Republican who
declares boldly for Republican principles," that "he is not in am
bush, he is behind no blind, he stands out in the open." This is
all perfectly true, and to it we would add the expression of our con
viction that there is no man in America with a keener and a more
sympathetic insight into national needs or with a more hearjy
determination to supply them, and that there is no man who knows
better how to do it. It will never be done by frenzied appeals to
popular passion, nor by the noisy arts of the demagogue.
President Roosevelt is above all else a strong man with a tem
pered and sagacious judgment, and because he has these great and
indispensable qualities he is able to look at every problem in its
entirety, to invoke upon his words and upon his actions a spirit
of justice which can reform without destroying, and to advance with
no less certainty because he has the wisdom of the true statesman in
moving patiently and confidently along the lines of least resistance.

- The "report that M. Sidlowski is a
stockholder in the Royal Mercantile

WEDDING Tins FALL
Thomas Stewart, an able bodied vag-
James Hawks believed he had a right
to chop], down the stairway leading
from the street to his home on the
second floor of â¢ 732 Fulton street, t In
the first place, he argued, only his own
family would be put to any inconven
ience by his removal of the means of
Ingress and egress, and, in the second
place, the stairs had - been so debili
tated by the effects ot the rainstorm
that they were no longer safe to tread
upon.. Therefore he consldered.it the
prerogative of no person outside of
his own household to dictate what he
should do or should not do with - the
stairway. Although he questioned the
right of Patrolman. Earle to arrest him
for malicious mischief;- -he did not at
tempt to resist that officer, but meekly
accompanied him to -the prison. He
hoped that Judge Mogan would .weigh
carefully the circumstances before pro
nouncing judgment. .
His Honor took all the facts into con
sideration before he dismissed Mr.
Hawks and ordered restored to him
the ax which the ' policeman had ap
propriated with intention to submit as
evidence for the 'prosecution.
Captain Lewis Lazzarevich lost his
position as master of the steamer
Wing and Wing last Friday, but de
spite that fact he boarded the vessel
Saturday morning and bullied the crew
around just as If he were still author
ized to do so- Among those who ig
nored his commands was the ship's
blacksmith, and that functionary's re
fusal to do as ordered resulted in his
being struck upon the head and knock
ed down a hatchway by the ' retired
skipper. Judge Mogan will hear the
defense next Saturday. -
Judge Mogan consented to have the
charge of grand larceny against John
Benson changed tof that of battery,
and then sentenced him to six months'
imprisonment.
Benson is 18 years of age and by
occupation a sailor. He was arrested
on September 15 on complaint of Mrs.
Kate Courtenay of 332 Alain street,
whom he knocked down and, it was
alleged, attempted to rob at Main and
Howard streets. Several firemen who
Â¦witnessed the incident testified that
the young fellow was. drunk and appar
ently did not realize what he v/as do
ing. He was given a good character
"by the superintendent of the Sailors'
Home, where he resided.
Vaino Auvo Mativen, harboring re
venge for real or fancied wrong by a
compatriot, John Yokila, came from
Oakland with blood in his eye. But
he did not propose to take cowardly
advantage of the man he hated. No,
indeed. Instead ef committing ordi
nary assault and battery he procured
a pair of fencing foils, went to Yoki
la's residence, 24 3 Steuart street, and
challenged him to cut, thrust and
parry until one or the other was in
capacitated for further fighting. In
stead of accepting the challenge Yo
kila had Mativen arrested and charged
wfth disturbing the peace. Judge Con-
Ian continued the hearing.
Edward Murray was posing as a
one-armed beggar on the Barbary
Coast, when Patrolman Nelson discov
ered the cheat and arrested him. The
policeman testified that Murray had
one of his arms twisted behind him in
such a way as to lead the casual ob
server to imagine that it had been
amputated at the shoulder, and that
he was reaping a harvest of small
coins from pitying pedestrians when
his swindle was checked. Judge Con-
Ian gave him six months' imprison
ment.
When a dairyman attempted to
ter the elevator of the Strathmore
apartment house, 207 Larkin street,
with intent to deliver milk tq Attorney
Ed. S. Green on thV fifth floor,. he was
restrained by the janitor, Thomaa F.
Doran, who took the ground that the
hoist was for the use of guests only. So
the milkman toiled upstairs and re
counted the incident to Mr. Green,
who thereupon acompanied him to tho
first floor and. It is alleged, punished
Doran. Judge Mogan 'continued the
case till October 15.
Edward Almon and his wife,. Nellie,
were in a saloon at -61 Third street
early yesterday morning when a shot
was fired, and Patrolman Tillman
rushed in to investigate. From the
contradictory stories told ' by . those
present the officer became convinced
that Mr. Almon had made a target of
his wife, but the woman denied it and
supplemented her denial with such
oral abuse of the accuser that he took
both, her and her spouse into custody.
Judge Cabaniss continued the case.
Almon is a bartender.
It was the opinion of both Mr. and
Mrs. Barker, and they voiced it with
emphasis yesterday morning in the
court of Police Judge Mog&n, that
Dentist M. E. Smith must have been
either insanely reckless of consequences
or imbued with murderous desirfe when
he fired his pistol last Sunday after
noon and frightened them almost to the
swooning point. They were seated on
the ocean beach, opposite M ; street,
they averred, when the sharp report; of
a revolver, shot behind them, and the
simultaneous splash of a bullet in "the
water at which they were i pensively,"
gazing rudely dispelled" their day.
dream. Springing to their respective
feet they saw Dentist Smith, pistol in 1
hand, standing on the boulevard, and
apparently preparing to /send- another
leaden missile in the direction taken
by its predecessor, whlbh : was in direct
line with their persons. '^They fran
tically requested him to save -his' am- ,
munition and then had him arrested
for discharging firearms within the city!
limits. They were certain 'that their
lives were only preserved by a. sand
hummock that lay between them and
the marksman when he fired .the first <
shot. Mr. Barker, indeed, believed that'
the bullet whizzed directly a few iflches :
above his head and that if he had not
happened to be In a recumbent position
it would have entered his : . body. â¢ So
narrowly did it miss him that- he ; both
saw and heard its flight. :. ' ' '. .
The defendant said he did ' not per- (
ceive any one between himself and the I
ocean when he fired the shot and the
only motive he had in firing it was. to
ascertain whether his pistol â¢ was in !
working order. As he had; never seen !
or heard ot Mr. or Mrs. Barker until '
they leaped from behind the hummock
that concealed them from his â¢ gaze
when he took aim, he certainly, had no !
desire to kill or even scare them, i
Mr. Barker, however, insisted on In- i
sinuating that something more ', than
mere thoughtlessness was at the bot
tom of the dentist's misdemeanor, and
so vociferous did he become in denun
ciation of that gentleman's conduct
that the Judge took issue with him.
His Honor held that the defendant
could be censured only for carelessness
in his pistol practice, just as Mr. Bar
ker had been rather careless In his
dealing with the truth when he testi
fied that he saw the bullet fly and
heard it buzz. Then the case was taken
under advisement.
John tRell was intoxicated when he
entered the Winchester Hotel last Sun
day night and, unpercelved by any, of
the ' usually vigilant attaches, went to
bed in a front room. Some time later,
however,' â¢ he was discovered by a
watchman, who, after much trouble,
awakened him and requested that he
pay a dollar for use of tne apartment.
M/.' Bell said he consiCered the rate
exorbitant, but rather than' be ejected
he "would pay fifty cents for his night's
lodging: * The offer, was. declined and
Mr,. Bell was requested to 'Vacate, but
he; acted bo obstinate-ly that. a police
man was called to arrest him for de
frauding an Innkeeper.- When searched
at" the prison $6 was found In one of
â¢biar pockets.: 1 - *â¢ ' Â¦ ' 'â¢' â¢ Â¦"'Â¦-Â¦'
"Are you willing to pay a 'dollar for
the room?" inquired Judge Mogan yes
terday morning. '.
'"Certainly hot," was the answer.
"The apartment is tnot worth' a dollar
a night, and, besides. I occupied it only
a short time. However, to avoid trou
ble. I, renew rhy 'offer- of fifty centa.'.'
_v"Your desire to save ; trouble is ap
preciated,^' said the Court, "but I am
afraid that is as far as It can be pam
pered. When you come here for sen
tence to-morrow you will find that the
room has cost you at least $10 or im
prisonment for as many days."
- "I am acting on principle," said Mr.
Bell. ' - â¢ â¢ -
.. "And you are to be congratulated on
being able to afford to do so," said the
Judge.
; Mr. Bell recently came from an in
terior town. :
rant, was sent up for six months by
Judge Mogan for soliciting alms at
Sutter and Kearny streets. Patrolman
Teutenberg testified that the defendant
hurTted anathemas at pedestrians who
ignored his appeals for aid..

Hay and Sir Cheng Tung Liang Cheng,
the Chinese Minister, have at last be
gun to lay the foundation for a new
Chinese exclusion treaty and It is ex
pected that .the convention will r be
ready for submission to the Senate' at
the approaching session. * Tl^ treaty
will, It is understood, replace all ex
isting laws on the subject. â¢ It is the
intention to continue in full force in
the treaty the principle of the exclu-
Bion of Chinese coolies and the Chi
nese Government itself is perfectly
willing that this should be done.
The treaty will contain, however,
provisions regarded as much needed
and earnestly sought for by the Chi
nese Government for many years,
lrJbklng to a more considerate, liberal
and kindly* treatment of the higher
class of Chinese seeking to enter our
ports.

tee, after a protracted discussion of
the coal strike situation, to-day issued
a statement declaring that the asso

the last in the present conflict and
will if necessary raise $100,000 to
break up the strike. The association
will not consent to arbitration nor to
a conference with the strike support
ers. The reasons given are that the
union is endeavoring to enforce a
closed shop, which the committee de
clares is un-American and against the
Interest of the Dublic.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
Hall alleged that both men, in con
versation with others,. had accused him
of disgraceful practices while he was
a member of the Calumet Club. The
answer filed was to the effect that
the statements made were true and the
conversation privileged. Hall . denied
the truth of the charges, and on last
Wednesday from Supreme Justice
Levintrltt secured an order requiring
Bond to give a bill of particulars. On
the settling of this motion all the
papers were filed In the Supreme Court
and knowledge of the suits became
public
Frank de Puyster Hall was a mem
ber of an old New York family and
until recently was a member of the
firm of F. de Puyster Hall & Co., wine
importers. His resignation as a mem
ber of the Calumet Club was requested
on July 25, 1903, and was immediately
given. Hall was also a member of the
St. Anthony Club, the New York Yacht
Club and the Trinity Alumni. In all
his suits Hall alleged that the state
ments made were false and maliciously
made, that because of these statements
he was obliged to resign the presidency
of F. de Puyster Hall & Co., that
his business and social acquaintances
refused longer to transact business with
him or to .associate with him and that
he had been obliged to abandon en
tirely his occupation.
Hall Â«.vas about 50 years old, was de
voted to athletics, having a good ath
letic record in college, where he was a
member of the Delta Psi Fraternity.
Hall's body, partly dressed, was
found by servants lying In a pool of
blood on the floor in his bachelor apart
ments. A revolver was found under
neath the body. On a table amo'ng ar
ticles of clothing and jewelry was a
package of letters. Some of the let
ters had been opened, while others were
still sealed. Hall had been dead only
a short time.
Another suit similar to those against
Bond and Cormack was brought
against Ernest Staples, and this case
came up before Judge Palmlrle to-day.
The attorneys for both sides were
technically ready to go on with the
case, but having heard rumors of Hall's
suicide, the defendant's attorneys filed
a motion for a new answer to the com
plaint. Justice Palmlrle granted the
motion, thus temporarily disposing of
the case.
NEW YORK, Oct. 10.â Frank de
Puyster Hall, a member of several
prominent clubs, to-day shot and killed
himself. A suit brought by him against
two other clubmen, alleging slander
and demanding (10*0,000 damages, was
to have come up in court to-day.
Knowledge of the institution of the
Blander suits only became public dur
ing the past week, although the first
suits were begun last May. These were
against Alfred H. Bond, president of
the Calumet Club, and George H. Cor
mack, secretary of the New York
Yacht Club.
The accusation against Police Com
missioner H. "W. Hutton. "special chief
of police for 1129 Dupont street," for
his removal from office for Illegally
'causing the arrest of Mary Duran and
for which he was adjudged guilty of
contempt of court by Judge Cook In
violating the Injunction restraining
the police from interfering with the
restaurant business of Jean Pon. came
up before- Judge Lawlor yesterday. At
the previous calling of the case Gavin
McNab, on behalf of Hutton, had filed
a demurrer to the accusation and the
Judge ordered that briefs be submit
ted by both sides on the points raised.
Arguments of counsel were heard
yesterday and Attorney George D.
Collins asked for immediate Judgment,
as Hutton In his brief had practically
admitted the facts. The Judge inti
mated that he would render his de
cision on Thursday. â¢
McXab contends that under section
772 of the Penal Code the accusation
should have been made by the District
Attorney and not by a private citizen.
He further contends that the fact3
stated in the accusation did not show
neglect of duty on the part of Hutton.
who might have done, something in
excess of his duty as a Police Com
missioner. If he had done anything
at all he had merely overstepped his
bounds and nothing else.
Collins answers the first point by al
leging that the Supreme Court has de
cided that it is not necessary to carry
on the proceedings by the District At
torney, but by a private citizen, and
that the law on the subject has been
declared constitutional. On the second
point Collins argues that the highest
duty of a public official is to main
tain the rights and liberties of the
people and he can only perform those
duties which the law imposes upon
him. If, as admitted, Hutton over
stepped the bounds as a Police Com
missioner he neglected his duty and
came within the provisions of section
772 of the Code.
Attorney Collins says he will file a
mandamus In a day or two to compel
the Mayor to declare Hutton's ofncn
vacant and to appoint his successor.
He says he has learned that no appeal
will be taken to the Supreme Court
against Judge Cook's decision finding
Hutton guilty of contempt, as it i3
admitted to be invulnerable and the
Mayor has therefore no ground for
delay in giving effect to the section of
the charter declaring the office va
cant.
Thirty commissioned officers were
convicted by general court-martial the
sentence being disapproved In two
cases, and four were acquitted. Of the
3897 enlisted men convicted, sentences
were disapproved in 46 cases. The num
ber of enlisted men acquitted after
trial was 311. Nine officers were dis
missed by sentence and In four cases
the sentences of dismissal Â¦ were com
muted to loss of numbers. The number
of men sentenced to dishonorable dis
charge was 2056.
Appended to the report are extracts
from the reports of judge advocates
.of departments. The following is quot
ed from the report of Lieutenant Col
onel Dunn, Judge advocate, Depart
ment of Colorado:
"These desertions in large part are
attributed to the malign influence of
saloons and brothels situated near the
reservations, seducing enlisted men
from the paths of decency. This is
only another of the many arguments in
favor of restoring to the army the can
teen, which provides places of amuse
ment and social Intercourse, where men
could get light refreshments, under re
straining, decent and orderly influ
ence."
Captain Roberts, acting judge advo
cate, Department of Texas, says:
"With the beginning of the work on
the addition to the post of Fort Sam
Houston, it Is observed that the prices
of business property immediately In
the rear of the new reservation have
materially advanced and that arrange
ments-are already being made for the
construction of the usual assortment
of saloons, that the virtual abolition of
the canteen features of the post ex
change has made a universal accom
paniment of every military post. I
think It is beyond question that per
mission to sell beer in the post ex
change would drive out of business at
least two-thirds of the low resorts In
the vicinity of posts."
WASHINGTON. Oct. 10.â The annual
report of General George B. Davis,
Judge advocate general, to the Secre
tary of War shows the total number of
trials by general court-martial during
the year to have been 4249, being 1026
less than in the preceding year.
"The marked dimlnunition in the
number of trials by general court-mar
tial, which amounts to nearly twenty
per cent of the number of cases tried
in the year ended June 30, 1903," says
the judge advocate general, "is very
gratifying, as indicating that the con
ditions of the military service are now
such as to require less frequent re
sorts to court-martial procedure in or
der to maintain discipline in the mili
tary establishment."
It also is noted that only two persons
were tried by military commission, sev
enty less than in the preceding year.
Commenting on this, the general says:
"The large decrease in trials by mil
itary commission was due to the fact
that peace existed during the entire
year in the Philippine Islands, except
in certain portions inhabited by the
Moro tribes."

. A motion for a nonsuit in the case
of Hujrh Craig against "Elijah" John.
Alexander Dowie tor the recovery of
$1762 was denied yesterday by Judge
Murusky. and the case will be argued
this morning.- Roscoe S. Gray, attor
ney for the prophet, based his motion
for the nonsuit on the grounds that
the loan was made to Dowie with the
expectation of its being paid from the
surplus receipts of the Grand Opera
house mission in 18 88. or from re
mittances from Australia.' It'had hot
been proven, he said.' that there was
any surplus, any remittance, or thaC
Dowie was ever able to pay the obli

and said that on other occasions '-, he
had loaned Dowie $100 and J 400, and,

CHICAGO. Oct. 10.â A radical decline In
grain prices at Liverpool had a depressing in
fluence on the wheat market here at the open
ing. The December option was off a shade,
while May was higher. The weakness, abroad
was duo mainly to large shipments from Rus
sia. An additional drag on the local market
was a fresh break in corn prices. For a time
commission houses had liberal offerings, but
the demand wa"s light. As a result December
suld off to $1 07% and May to $1 08&. The
market made a slight recovery on buying said
to be for the account of a leading bull operator,
but trading lacked animation. Continued
heavy -primary receipts were a seemingly ef
fectual check to bull operators. During the
lutttr part of the session, however, the market
became decidedly firm as a result of active
covering by shorts. A report from Minneapolis
stating that a good sized lot had been sold
caused a rise. The Roumanian crop report
came about rhi 9 time, placing the yield at
52,000.000 bushels, compared with 72,000,000
bushels last year. The Roumanian news proved
a useful Instrument in lifting tha market, tije
iK:i:uik! forcing December up to $1 0S% and
May to $1 oa%. T&e market closed firm, with
December at $1 0S% and May ?1 OO^Sl 00%.
A continuation oX warm weather was the
principal element in a weak corn market. De
cember opened h*@~A.e lower at 47^@48>ac,
sold between 47%c and 4SVic and closed at 4Sc.
Oats were easy. Deftmber closed %c lower
at 28*1 e.
Provisions were weak on general liquidation.
At the close January pork was off 27>4c at
$12 75; lard and ribs were each down 7%c at
$7 40 and $7 U7>4.

Wheat and Other Grains. |
WHEAT â Foreign futures, were lower and [
weak. The world's shipments for the week |
â¢were aa follows, in quarters: Russian, 740,000; [
Danublan 124,000; Argentine, 72,000; Indian,
163.000* Australian 90,000. The American vis
ible, supply showed' the large increase of 3,232,
000 bushels.
Chicago declined from $1 O8V4 to $1 07%
and closed at $1 08%. - .
In this market futures were lo-wer and quiet.
The cash, gcahi was also quiet, the buyers
being shy and not disposed to pay askinjr j
prices, -but quotations remained unchanged. A
dispatch from Portland said that Wheat is
Soing East at the rate of 100 cars every day,
nd this is rapidly draining tha three North
western States of the lÂ»0t crop. At this rate
it will take seventy- two days yet to move the
balance of the Wheat already gold to Chicago I
and the Middle West. About Â«,5O0,0QO bushels
of this Wheat still remain to be moved. " The
shortage in cars has checked buying for Chi
cago account up north as already mentioned.

Roans and Seeds,
A further slight advance in Liraas is noted.
They are very firm, with the farmers not sell

400,000 sacks, and It is reported that owing to
the rains about uO.000 sacks will not be har
vested. Most other kinds are more nominal
than ever, as this second gtorm has Increased
the damage, and put the market all at sea i
again. At the same time there Is some move- ,
nient In large White and colored kinds to
Montana and the Southwest, several cars per
day going out on this business, and these de
scriptions show rather better prices In conse

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
Arrivals of Potatoes over Sunday were heavy,
aggregating over 6000 sacks, but a firm feeling
prevailed, as it was expected that subsequent
receipts would be light because of the rain,
and prices were well maintained. Fancy Sa
linas Burbanks were wanted and some marks
brought an advance. - Onions arrived freely,
but the market was reported steady at the 1
previously quoted rates.
Receipts of miscellaneous vegetables were
light, as the rain checked the movement from
some sections, and prices of some kinds were
higher. Fresh arrivals of Tomatoes cleaned
up readily at prices ranging from 85c to 50c
per box, while old and poor lota continued to
drag, with some selling below the quotations.

Receipts ot fresh fruits were light yesterday,
as the, rain at the close of laet week checked
picking in the growing districts. Strawberries
and Raspberries in good condition brought
higher prices, only a few chests being received
and there were not. enough Figs or Wine
Grapes on the market for a quotation. Apples
and other deciduous fruits, were In ample sup
ply and moved oft fairly at about previous
prices. The market for table Grapee was
steady except for the Seedless variety, which
dragged at sharply reduced prices. The other
varieties were in free supply and the receipts
came to hand In better condition than ex
pected, only a small portion of the offerings
showing the effects of the recent rains. Citrus
fruits were quiet and all klnd3 stood a9 pre
viously quoted. The feature of the market
was, the arrival of the first new crop Grape
Fruit of the season. Two boxea of the 04
size came in from Orovllle and were. held at
45 per box, but were not sold, having arrived
too late for the regular trade. Trade In Cran

Congressman Livernash addressed
two open air, meetings last night, one
at the corner of Fourth and Natoma
streets, the other at Fourth and Te
hama streets. In the course of his
remarks, he said in Dart:
An important business man of this city
writes me that he would be glad to support
my candidacy for Congress^ but for the fact
that he fears the adoption of the American
Federation . of Labor's eight-hour bill, for
which I have been working, would injuriously
affect American manufacturers. It is clear to
me that the gentleman has a mistaken view of
the scope of the eight-hour bill; and. as many
others Â¦ may share â¢ his misinformation : in - this
regard," it may, be .well to explain Just what
the biir covers. ' - ,
The Federal statutes at present require that
all work ( done > directly by the United States
shall be performed on the eight-hour basisâ
that V is Â¦ to - say. the .- workmen . engaged ' upon
it shall not bo obliged to toil in excess of eight
hours per - calendar day. 1 â¢ Now. the eight-hour
bill Congress has been declining to pass merely
provides that this â¢' eight-hour rule shall - cover
ail work done for ; the . Government : Instead of
solely all work done by the Government. It does
not at all touch work done by or for private
individuals; or for ; corporations/' - For Instance,
if-, the elsbt-hour bill were a law," the Union

The United Railroads yesterday laid
a petition before the Board of Public
Works asking that the curbing at
Kearny and Post streets be moved so
that the street railway company may

the right to lay a curved track at

Several taxpayers appeared before
the Supervisors' Finance ' Committee
yesterday to urge the payment of
judgments obtained against the city
for special taxes paid under protest
in 1902 for schools and a hospital, but
since declared invalid by the Supreme
Court. It was said that Auditor Baehr
had refused to pay the judgments until
he had compared them with the
amount paid In as taxes, and vigorous
Objection. was made to the delay. The
committee took the ground that the
Auditor must pay the judgments as
rendered.
The Supervisors. ordered the refund
of .the taxes .on condition that the
costs of suit be waived' by. the judg
ment creditors and the committee de
cided not to recommend the payment
of interest on the claims. An attor
ney representing forty-four - clients
who ' had obtained judgments j agreed
to .waive interest if his claims were
paid in/ fifteen days, j
Auditor Baehr later "informed the
committee that he .would not pay the
claims until he , had checked the
amounts on the tax books.
Resolutions were passed to print by
the board ordering the return of $35,
477,28 to. the United -Railroads, which
paid the amount to = the city for the
special taxes under protest; also the
return of 53390 07;to the Bankers' In

publican secretary of the State., Board
of Examiners, stated to the Bee on
May 2 last that the board of directors
had been extravagantly mismanaging

statement:
I know you personally will not hold me rÂ«

members of the board who may think that I

There will probably b'e a convention
of 10,000 â¢ members of the Christian
church in San Francisco in 1905. The
Rev. Walter Madison White, D. D.,
and Professor A. M. Elston left yes
terday for Chicago, where 40,000 mem
bers of the church are Ho be In con
vention, and the delegates from here
are to work for the convention to come
to this city. The convention is ' prac
tically pledged to give preference to
San Francisco.
At the Presbyterian Ministers' Asso
ciation meeting yesterday the members
were asked by the Rev. S. R. Wood to
co-operate in providing speakers for
the new chapel which has been secured
at the Presidio for Protestant worship.
It was decided to assume the care the
third Sunday in each month.
Mr. Rader thought the Rev. R. J.
Campbell of the City Temple "the
greatest preaclier who preaches the
poorest sermons of any one In the
world. But he draws great crowds
and is trained in the gifts of reaching
the business man."
As for the personnel of the London
pulpits he failed to find a Spurgeon, or
a Parker, or a Beecher, but he did
hear, he said, bright young men. and,
indeed, there never before were so
many bright young men in the London
pulpits.
The pastor also informed his hearers
that he thought there was more free
dom in the expression of theological
conviction in England than here. The
congregations in the New York
churches he found small as compared
with those of London.
Bishop Harris was the honored guest
at a dinner later in the day, at which
about one hundred were present.
A great assemblage of members of
the Congregational Ministers' Associa
tion met yesterday morning to hear the
Rev. William Rader, pastor of the
Third Congregational Church, tell of
his church experiences during three
months in London. He told of his
preaching in London and of the politics
agitating the churches in England,
which he considered as tending toward
a. closer bond of union.
The proverbial Methodist enthusiasm
was fully demonstrated yesterday,
when one of the largest gatherings of
local celebrities of the Methodist Epis
copal church met in Epworth Hall to
give Bishop M. C. Harris a hearty god
speed on his journey to Japan.
Bishop Harris sails on the Mongo
lia Thursday, October 13, to take up his
labors among a people with whom and
for whom he has spent years of his
life. In acknowledgment of all that
the Bishop has done toward taking
Christianity to the Japanese, the Jap
anese ladies of San Francisco have
presented Mrs. Harris with a handsome
goid watch and chain, while the Jap
anese men have given the Llshop a
well-filled purse, with a direction to do
with it as might seem best when in
Japan.
Dr. F. D. Bovard presided at yester
day's reception, and addresses eulo
gizing the work of Bishop Harris were
delivered by the Rev. George W.
White. D.D.; the Rev. W. S. Matthew,
presiding elder of the district; the Rev.
H. Hiroto, nastor of the Japanese

D.D., the Rev. James H. N. Williams,
the Rev. A. C. Bane, the Rev. George
Guth, D.D., and other prominent pas
tors and laymen.
In reply to all the warm eulogies the
Bishop' said he was greatly encouraged
and strengthened by the feeling mani
fested toward him.

the company, claiming to exercise
powers granted under its articles of
incorporation, has issued a contract
promising to pay $1.50 for every week
ly Installment of $1, no more than
eighty installments to be received on
one contract. It has done and intend
ed to do no other business. No part
of the money received for weekly in
stallments from the certificate-holders,
it is alleged, is invested to produce an
jncome, and not less than 20 per
cent of the receipts is used in paying
the officers, servants and employes of
the company and for distribution
among its stockholders. The com
pany, it is charged, has no* assets of
any character excepting the weekly
receipts, and no part of the capital
stock has been paid in. the representa

Certificates are now outstanding for
payment at maturity of not less than

Friends and relatives know of no
reason why the young man should
have ended his life. He was about 29
years of age and of an apparently
cheerful disposition.
On last Saturday evening Lee parted
tenderly with Miss de Martini. They
had been engaged for more than a
year. He spoke cheerfully of the
time when they would be married.
But just before he left her he said,
"This may be the last time we may
meet, Millie." The girl only laughed.
They were to be married soon and she
was happy.
Yesterday morning Lee did not re
port to the City of Paris dry goods
store, where he is employed as a ship
ping clerk. He telephoned to his
brother, Robert Lee, that he was ill.
The brother informed Miss de Martini.
The girl hurried to the place where
she thought her lover lay ill. She
found him dying. Beside Lee was a
tender epistle addressed to Millie de
Martini. The heartbroken girl sum
moned an ambulance and Lee was
taken to the Central Emergency Hos
pital, where heroic measures failed to
revive him. The girl waited outside the
place, sobbing, while her lover passed
away. When told that he was dead
Miss de Martini fainted.
Following are extracts from the let
ter addressed to the girl and found
near Lee's bedside:
I am up against it. dear. That is why I do
this. Pray for me. Xever mind, Millie, after
a while you will fcrget all this and only think
of Bill' e as he â¢ goes to his last sleep. I feel
bad for you because you are so good. Will you
go over to see my little nephew? Tell him. I
have gone away, but do not tell him how I
went. Millie, dear, I would like to see you be
fore I go, but I can't muster up courage to
part with you. As I lose my senses, Millie, I
Â¦will see your kind face and hear your voice.
Good -by.
When Millie de Martini walked into
the room of her fiance, William Lee.
at 780 Folsom street, yesterday she
found him unconscious from the ef
fects of laudanum. He had drained a
vial of the poison and while death
drew near he penned a last letter to
the girl.
Resolved, That a brother member, Charles J.
Williams. bÂ« indorsed , as the Labor Union
nominee for Congressman from the Fifth Con
gressional District. Mr. Williams is now serv
ing his second year as -president of the Book
binders' Union: has been a consistent trades
union man for the past twenty-flve years and
has the confidence of his organization. It Is
*n admitted fact that he will always do
noble service In any capacity.
In the Sixth District J. C. Needham,
the Republican candidate, will be elect
ed for his fourth term in Congress. The
candidacy of his opponent. Judge Con
ley, is not formidable. Advices are to
the effect that San Joaquin County will
roll up a majority of 800 for Needham.
Seward A. Simons of New York, who
has campaigned as a speaker with
Chauncey â¢ M. Depew and Theodore
Roosevelt, will speak at Madera, Mo
desto and Merced.
Local Union No. 31, International
Brotherhood -of Bookbinders, has
adopted the following:
SIXTH DISTRICT.
Bell, the Democratic nominee for
Congress in the Second District, is
making a campaign of personal ex
planation. The Republican news
papers of the district have driven
him from the platform of his
party and he is out in the mud talk
ing about the abolished canteen at the
Soldiers' -Home. In an article signed,
by Bell and published in the Home Al
liance, the Prohibition paper at Wood
land, the notion is given out that the
veterans expended all their money for
canteen checks. This is far from the
truth, as one object lesson will illus
trate. One old veteran. Thomas . Mc-
Donald, saved his pension money until
he had a lump sum of $1000 to his credit
with the treasurer. His outside friends
took him from the home and had a
guardian appointed by the court to
care for him. He died a few months
ago, and recently his estate was
wound up. j The law firm of Bell,
York & Bell, of which the Democratic
nominee Is the senior member, got $150
by allowance of the Napa Judge for
handling the case. The query arises.
Did Bell get this money in canteen
checks or cash? The receipt held by
the board of directors shows that the
guardian received the old veteran's
pension money in gold coin. A photo
graph of the receipt can be produced
showing that payment in cash was ac
knowledged.
The efforts of the Prohibition press to
bring in side Issues to aid Bell do not
disturb the serenity of Duncan E. Mc-
Kinlay, the Republican nominee. Mc-
Kinlay stands squarely on the Repub
lican platform for prosperity and pro
tection. /He is making a splendid cam
paign and winning supporters in every
county of the district.
SECOXD DISTRICT.
The people of this district realize this, and,
while they listen to Mr. Caminetti with the
polite attention that is the . characteristic of
gentlemen everywhere, they will vote, not for
the Democratic candidate, but. for their pres
ent representative in- Congress, J. N. Gillett.
Mr. Gillett belongs to the Republican party
and will not vote to unsettle the present pros
perous conditions of the country. A change In
the tariff would mean that capital, which we
nÂ«ed -to develop our mines, will cease to flow
into this district and would be locked up in
safe-deposit vaults. Mr. Caminetti would
vote to change the tariff. Mr. Gillett will
not. Not only that, but a vote for Mr. Gil
lett' means that the miner will be heard at
Washington through . a Congressman who
thoroughly understands the needs of the In
dustry and who will be heard â a man who is
sincere .and who will secure" such alterations
in the existing law that the resumption of,
hydraulic mining shall be actually brought
about without Injury to the farming interests.
Since the Caminetti bill was passed, the
debris has continued to flow into the rivers;
the birriers erected by the commission have
snapper) like shoestrings before the first
strain, ar.d the number of hydraulic mines In
operation has been reduced to bo few that
they count as none. Since the passage of the
Cam'netti bill, the small owner, . the man of
little means, has found it Impossible to bear
the expense entailed on him unnecessarily by
that statute, and the few hydraulic mines
that are being operated are in the hands of
companies with great capital, for men of
money alone can conform to the requirements
of tho commission appointed under the act.
The voters of the First Congressional
District are taking the measure of A.
Caminetti, the Democratic nominee.
The miners who were twice fooled by
Caminetti cannot be deceived again.
The Grass Valley Tidings remarks:
I trust you will be able to make this clear
to those of your people who are interested in
matters coming before Congress. Yours very
truly. ' J. M. BABCOCK, Chairman.
FIRST DISTRICT.
The Republican State Central Com
mittee is in possession of positive and
direct intelligence to the effect that the
Democrats are preparing to trade
everything in sight to secure votes for
the Democratic Congressional nominees
in the First, Second and Sixth districts.
Offers to vote for Republican candi
dates for the Legislature in exchange
for Congressional support are openly
made. The chief aim of the Democratic
party in this campaign is to secure con
trol of the House of Representatives.
It is computed that a gain of sixteen
seats will give the party that ascend
ency.
The following letter has been received,
at Republican headquarters in this
State from the chairman of the Repub
lican Congressional Committee, Ne^v
York:
George Stone, Chairman, San Francisco,
Cal.: Dear Sir â Your favor of the 5th re
ceived. It goes without saying that a member
of the majority party Is much more potent In
securing legislation In Congress than a mem
ber of the minority, and any 'district In your
State where the people are looking for Con
gressional action, they should by all means
send a Republican representative, for thÂ«
reason that as a Republican he is part of the
organization, as a Democrat is entirely out
sWe of the organization, and the organization
contrc!s and directs the legislation of the
House.
Judge Hebbard yesterday granted
Captain John E. Madden permission
to take his son, John E- Maddeo Jr.,
from the State for a period of " four
months. Captain Madden has been or
dered to join his regiment at Salt Lake
and will be accompanied by the boy's
grandmother, Margaret E. Madden.
Suits for divorce were filed yester
day by Marguerite McClenegan against
Frank McClenegan, cruelty; Jessie
Hall against Earle B. Hall, desertion;
Millicent Harper against John Harper,
neglect; Mary McGarrigan against Mi
chael McGarrigan, neglect; Elena Kat
zung against Charles Katzung, deser
tion; Archibald Charman against L. R.
S. Charman, cruelty.
Divorces were granted yesterday by
Judge Hebbard to Robert H. Ellis
from Mae Ellis, desertion; to Nettie L.
Trimpler from William Trimpler, de
sertion; by Judge Sloss to Mabel L.
Semmens from Willie Semmens, cruel
ty; by Judge Kerrigan to Myrtle E.
Richardson from William A. Richard
son, cruelty: to Amelia A. Butler from
Peter C. Butler, cruelty; to Charles
McGim from Anna McGim, desertion;
by Judge Troutt to Robert A. E.
Schroeder from Marie Schroeder, de
sertion; to Max Friebert from Johanna
G- Friebert, cruelty; by Judge Graham
to Marie Christianson from Nick Chris
tianson. cruelty; by Judge Murasky to
Mattie Kessler from Henry Kessler, in
temperance and neglect; to Katie
Baird from Charles W. Baird, failure
to provide.
"She stormed around and made life
unbearable," declares the captain, and
in 1899, one evening when he came
home from work he found her "with
her head hanging over the wood, box
and her face a gory mass of blood, the
result of one of her regular sprees."
On September 30 of last year she "was
again rampant and had to be put to
bed, from which she immediately roll
ed to the floor, cutting herself on the
footboard."
When she came to she accused him
of the "damages sustained from the
fall." Frederici says that when they
were married she owned a house and
lot on DeBoom street, but he paid off
a $1800 mortgage on it and he wants
the money restored.
The divorce case of Mamie Merkel
against Sebastian Merkel, retired, with
$20,000 worth of property, was dismiss
ed yesterday. A stipulation says the
defendant "has promised and agreed
to treat plaintiff properly and conduct
himself humanely toward her in the
future and has given her other consid
erations."
James F. Lawler, ex-pugilist v and
proprietor of the saloon at Turk and
Taylor streets, yesterday asked Judge
Troutt to annul his marriage with
Katie Redan, which occurred at Stock
ton on the first of last month when
Lawler was drunk. The court wants
further evidence.
Picturesque, though unbeautiful, is
the cross complaint filed yesterday by
Leopold Frederici, captain of the tug
Milton, to his wife's suit for divorce.
She charged him with cruelty. He de
nied it. They were married twenty
four years ago and have a daughter
twenty-three years old. Almost from
the day of their marriage, says the
husband, his wife has shown a fond
ness for intoxicating liquors and "clan
destinely succeeded in getting innum
erable bottles of beer and whisky into
the house.
