VOLUME XCVII âNO. 34.
CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IS OPENED
THE California Legislature was opened yesterday without any display of that friction that usually accompanies the organization of great political bodies.
Within a short time after getting together the Senate chose Senator E. I. Wolfe of San Francisco as President pro tern, of the Senate. In equally quick time
the Assembly met and chose F. G. Prescott as its presiding officer. The day's proceedings were enlivened by a Struggle on the part of some of the solons to
reduce the amount allowed for patronage. The effort came to naught and the usual number of plums will be distributed to the party workers. The contest for
the Senatorship was enlivened by the entrance of Postmaster Arthur Fisk into the fight.

CALL, HEADQUARTERS, SACRA-1
MENTO, Jan. 2.âThe Controller Is
ready to audit the demands of the Leg- |
Islature. There is in the State treasury'
a sum in excess of $8,000,000. This is
the largest amount of money ever
placed at the mercy of a California
Legislature. Of the sum mentioned, a i
portion, amounting to $3,000,000, is in
the general fund and is therefore im
mediately available. A very large i
amount of the remainder will be ap
portioned, to the schools of the several \
counties during the present month. It i
if? said that the Senate was apprised of 1
the available wealtfi of the State when j
the majority Senators in caucus re- j
solvit) to appropriate each for himself J
a patronage stake of $20. It is figured
' that the cost of running the Senate for |
seventy clays will approximate $67,000.
This estimate is leached by adding!
$18,000 for statutory officers to the sum I
of $49,000 allowed for patronage. â  No
.body* asserts that the Governor is;
pleased or that the representatives of j
the Republican State Central Commit
tee are happy over the action of the
. tnau: < auc us. Statesmen, however,
console themselves with the reflection
that the sum of $8,000,000 i 6 in the!
treasury and that a portion of the ac-J
cumulated wealth should be put in cir
culation among the people.
The Senatorial contest, compared
With former struggles for the toga, is j
tame and uninteresting. There is some
talk ol an organization of all the anti-
Flint forces, which causes the Flint
boomers to assert that here is an ac
knowledgment that the Los Angeles
aspirant is the leader in point of
strength. The suggestion of a caucus
of the antis" is inspired by the knowl
edge that the railroad end of the so
called "organization" is displaying con
siderable activity in behalf of Flint's
candidacy.
The railroaders say that orders have
been given to keep hands off as between
Flint and Knight. This peculiar in
struction is interpreted by several
statesmen to mean that the railroad
managers expect to round up the legis
lators for Knight and Flint and ulti
mately vote them for Knight. It is just
possible that Flint will get the prize
goid brick of the session. On the other
hand, it is said that the initials "G. A.
K." Â«re already engraved on the brick.
The balloting will begin Tuesday,
January 10, and the first joint conven
tion Of the two houses will take place
at noon Wednesday, January 11. It
would not surprise the politicians if an
election of a United States Senator
should be reached at the first session
of the joint convention. The celerity
â with which both houses effected organl-
Eation to-day in order that balloting
for Senator should begin at the earliest
time possible is indicative of a desire
of the legislators to dispose of the Sen
atorship quickiy. The Assemblymen
exhibited so much haste to-day that
they received in a formal manner a
message from the Senate before the
Assembly waa organized.
FISK IX THE FIGHT.
There are aspirants for the office of
United States Senator other than Bard,
Oxnard, Flint and Knight. The light
ning rod of Postmaster Fisk is visible.
Senator Shortridge and Assemblyman
Jones are In the camp of Fisk. Assem
blyman Samuel H. Beckett will line up
for I. W. Hellman Jr. Senator Welch
and Assemblyman Treadweii will sup
port John D. Daly. It is expected that
the San Diego delegation will vote for
U. S. Grant. A bunch of metropolitan
statesmen will name Ruef when the
roll is called.
No word has yet arrived from the
mysterious body politic known as the
organization. If the election of a United
States Senator depends upon the de
sire of that Intangible force the people
of California must wait patiently until
the word arrives to lift the burden of
uncertainty that exists and direct the
loyal legislators to the proper path.
Late to-night word was circulated
that over the telephone from San Fran
cisco the order had come that Frank
P. Flint must be clothed with the toga
at all hazards. All inquiries, however,
failed to give the report authenticity
and Flint not only denied that such
.was true but Joined with the. opinion
expressed by Knight and the managers
cf Bard that the so-called organiza
tion has agreed to keep hands off and
give every man full opportunity to de
velop the strategy born of his ambition.
KNOWS OF NO ORDERS.
"These reports of orders from San
Francisco are simply based on the
hopes of some of the political hangers
on," said Flint. "They have no basis
of truth. We are all fighting honor
ably and fairly, but I can say that I
think I have the battle won. Some of
my friends are sanguine that I will be
elected on the first ballot, but I do not
. claim this. I will say.vhowever, that
I believe I will be elected on the sec
ond ballot after those that desire to
indulge in complimentary votes deflect
to the avowed candidates. And in
conclusion I will say that this talk of
orders from headquarters is all mere

rumors and will be indulged in so long
as men run for office in California.
But there is no truth in it. I have
heard nothing of it. 1 do not believe
it and still hold that this fight will be
fairly fought."
The serious hand Arthur Fisk has
taken in the fight has given rise to
much speculation. Fisk is now an
avowed candidate and says he hopes
to land in case none of the men now
prominently mentioned in the fight se
cure enough votes to elect. Fisk's candi
dacy shows that he thinks there is a
probability of a deadlock and he knows
something about the game of electing
United States Senators.
"1 am what you may call a receptive
candidate," said the former Speaker,
"I am ready to receive anything that
may come my way. My candidacy fs
purely personal and I think I have
enough friends to elect me if matters
shape themselves right. 1 am in the
fight in earnest and in case one of those
supposed to be leading in the fight does
not develop enough strength to win I
think I can get the place."
Fisk is credited with only two votes
that are certain âthose of Jones of San
Francisco and Shorlrldge.
IN A RECEPTIVE MOOD.
Fisk's announcement that he is in a
receptive mood is taken as an indica
tion that he believes the forces that are
backing the southern candidates were
so embittered during the recent fight
there that it is impossible for a south
ern man to be elected and that all
northerners in receptive mood and cor
responding ambition had better get into
the field early. Some say that George
A. Knight is going on the same theory,
but Knight has another story to tell.,
Knight says that he is here to get
into the fight on the first ballot and
stay in it until the last and that his
claims will be based on naught but his
record. The story that the organiza
tion had sent out word that Flint was
to be the man Knight also discredited.
He says he has positive assurance that
the fig.it is open and that it will be won
by fair means, no matter which man
gets it, and that the scandals of past
elections will not be repeated. To sub
stantiate his theory he points to the
fact that the legislators are all un
certain as to what the outcome of the
contest will be. Those that are pledged
know how they are going to vote and
that is all. The others are open to f , con
viction, but in just what manner this
"conviction" will reach them is only
conjectural. The day of the balloting
will alone determine this.
OXNARD IS CONFIDENT.
Henry T. Oxnard had lost none of his
confidence. He says that as yet every
one is at sea and that the battle has
not as yet fairly opened, to say noth
ing of the claims of some that it is al
ready won. The votes will show, he
says, and we must wait for them and
on them the future campaign can be
based.
At Senator Bard's headquarters the
same calm assurance prevails. Sena
tor Bard, they say there, has repre
sented California well and it is not
Callfornian that he should not be re
turned and his course in the Senate of
the United States indorsed. Politics
may have some bearing, they say, but
the loyalty of the legislators to one
that has filled his office well is more to
be depended on and on this they are
mostly depending, at the same time not
forgetting that politics must be played
and the points of the game consid
ered.
In brief, the situation hardly war
rants speculation as to its probable
outcome. It is a big game these am
bitious Californians are playing and so
far it Is an open fight, with the best
man," whoever he may be, the prospec
tive winner.
Governor Pardee Will Appoint Judges
Early Next Week.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2.âGovernor
Pardee said to-day that he would ap
point the judges of the new District
Court of Appeals some time next
week.
"I Intended to go to San Frajicisco
to talk with Chief Justice Beatty over
the appointment of the appellate
Judges," said Pardee, "but I was pre
vented from going through the press
of other matters. I feel that the
Chief Justice should be consulted re
garding the personnel of the new
court, as the Supreme Court is direct
ly interested in seeing that it is well
organized. I will take un this work
early next week and will see that the
new court is soon in operation."

E. I. Wolfe Is Elected President Pro Tern. of
Senate by His Colleagues.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2.âThe Senate
is organized and the majority of its
members, at least, are happy In the
contemplation of the Joys to be found
in distributing $20 a day patronage.
The Senate went into oaucus at 10
o'clock to agree upon officers and to
settle the patronage question. The
question of officers was easily settled
and in half an hour Senator E. I.
Wolfe had been agreed upon to serve
as president pro fern. L. A. Hllborn
had been named secretary, J. Louis
Martin sergeant at arms, B. G. Holt
minute clerk and the Rev. W. S. Hos
kinson chaplain.
But the question of patronage de
veloped a minor storm. Fifteen mem
bers of the Senate stood firmly against
the allowance of $20 a day and pro
tested that $16 was liberal* enough
and that If the Senate would be just
to the interests of the State It would
reduce even this figure, making the
allowance $12. Senators Ward, Wood
ward, Belshaw and Hahn led the fight
against the larger allowance and held
the question from a vote until they
had thoroughly argued the question,
but it was without avail.
When the vote was called on the
resolution to make the patronage $20
a day the fifteen opponents stood firm
and voted against it. The economists
are Senators Anderson, Belshaw,
Broughton, Carter, Hahn, Leeke,
Lynch, Mattos, McKee, Rambo, Row
ell, Rush, Simpson, Ward and Wood
ward. Senator Lukens was absent and
did not vote on the question, but it is
understood that he was opposed to
greater patronage than $16 a day.
ORGANIZATION EFFECTED.
The opening of the Senate at noon
was accomplished without flourish.
First the roll of hold-over Senators
was called and then the names of the
newly elected members were an
nounced and they were called to the
desk where the oath of office was ad
ministered. Just in front of the desk
are three chairs that lent a somber
touch to the scene. These chairs are
draped in black and during the last
session were occupied by the late Sen
ators Hubbell of San Bernardino, Wil
liams of San Francisco and Byrnes of
San Mateo.
After the new members had been

sworn In a resolution that the body
come to order was passed and Senator
Leavitt immediately took the floor to
place Senator Wolfe in nomination for
president pro tern. The nomination of
Wolfe was seconded by Senators
Shortridge and Welch on behalf of
the majority and by Senator Curtin on
behalf of the Democratic minority of
Aye, of which Curtin has been selected
the leader. ,
Senator Lukena placed Hilborn in
nomination for secretary, Hahn nomi
nated Holt for minute clerk and Sel
vage named Martin for sergeant at
arms. There was no protesting voice
and they were unanimously elected, as
was the Rev. Dr. Hoskinson -for chap
lain.
MESSAGE FROM PARDEE.
A resolution was next presented by
Senator Ralston providing that a com
mittee be appointed to notify the As
sembly that the Senate was organized
and ready for business. President An
derson appointed Ralston, Hahn and
Emmons a committee to notify the As
sembly and Lukena, Rowell and San
ford were named to notify the Gov
ernor. In a short time a message
came from the Governor. It gave him
pleasure, he said, to congratulate the
Senate on the fact that it had organ
ized under such pleasant auspices and
he Informed the body that he would al
ways be at its service during the ses
sion so pleasantly opened.
Senator Shortridge presented a reso
lution providing that the rules of the
thirty-fifth session of the Legislature
be adopted as the rules of the pres
ent session, except that rule 1 be
amended so as to provide that the
Senate meet each day, excepting Sun
days, at 10 a. m., unless otherwise pro
vided. Word then reached the Senate
that the Assembly was not yet or
ganized and upon motion an adjourn
ment was taken until 3 p. m.
When rhe Senate reconvened a mes
sage from the Assembly was read, to
the effect that the lower body had
perfected organization and was ready
to proceed. The Senate, after passing
a resolution of respect for the mem
bers of the body that have passed
away since the last session, adjourned
until 11 o'clock to-morrow morning.
At that time it is understood the Gov
ernor's message will be read and the
work of the session begun in earnest.
UaUTDNAW GOVERNOR OF CALIFORNIA AND TWO MEN WHO RECEIVED
HONORS AT THE HANDS OF THE 6ENATE AND ASSEMBLY OF THE
GOLDEN STATE NOW IN SESSION IN SACRAMENTO.
Prescott Is Chosen Speaker Pro Tem.
by Members of the Assembly.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2.âThe amount
of money each Assemblyman should
have to make good the promises of
patronage given by him during the
campaign was the subject that most
concerned the Republican members of
the Assembly during the caucus prior
to organization this morning. For
nearly two hours the statesmen
wrangled. The opinions as to what
was a proper amount per Assemblyman
to be set aside as a reward for those
who had labored in the ranks ran from
$6 to $12. The matter was finally put
to a vote on a resolution that the figure
be $10. This met the general support
of the San Francisco delegation, it
looking as if $12 were impossible. Drew,
Rolley, Chandler, Cromwell, Devlin
and others battled for a six-dollar limit.
A viva voce vote was taken. There
seemed to be a shade of noise in favor
of the negative but Atkinson declared
the $10 resolution carried. The ruling
was reversed on roll call by a vote of
forty to thirty-three. The matter went
over until the afternoon session.
The caucus also voted for Speaker
pro tern., Cromwell not lying down
without a flsht. The vote was forty
six to twenty-six. Prescott was ten
dered some nice compliments by his
colleagues during the process of elect
ing him Speaker. He was named by
Walsh of Alameda,, a member of the
last Assembly, who placed him in that
list of "Stalwart Americans."
Stanton of Los Angeles said that, but
for the uncertainty of politics he might
have been the one to be seconded, but
notwithstanding he spoke warmly of
the many* good qualities that endeared
Assemblyman Prescott to the house.
Duryea of Placer eulogized Prescott
and moved the nominations close.
LONESOME DEMOCRATS.
A Henry Clay figure rose over in the
corner and made a protest. It was
Assemblyman John F. Pryor of Han
ford who spoke.
"In behalf of the minority of this
House," said Pryor, gazing proudly on
the three other Democrats who held
seats, "I want to make a nomination
for Speaker."
He named Aubrey F. Lumley of Tu
lare, who was a member of the last
House.
"I beg the gentleman's pardon,"
said Duryea, "for overlooking the fact
that there are some Democrats in the

House. I withdraw my motion."
So the complimentary votes of the
Democrats, the lonesome four, went
to Assemblyman Lumley.
Speaker Prescott's speech in ac
cepting bore the stamp of originality.
He refused to take the ground that an
honor had been conferred upon him â
only a tremendous responsibility, he
saidâand he asked the House to as
sist him in every way in carrying the
weight of that responsibility and car
rying out the wishes of their party and
the people.
"This session will be a historical
one," he said, "from the fact that the
burden of the responsibility of all Its
legislation rests entirely on the Re
publicans of ths House, with the exÂ»
ceptlon of four gentlemen. I do not
regard the election of any of us as an
honor or a rote of confidence, but as
the placing upon us of a terrible re
sponsibility by the people. This re
sponsibility now pertains In a greater
measure to me. I was chosen not for
the conferring of an honor, but ftor the
placing of a heavy responsibility."
STEPPACHER MOLLIFIED.
The complimentary vote for Speaker
pro tern. went to Hawkins of Wood
land.
Burge of Merced had a man for
minute clerk and would have taken
from Jake Steppacher that which had
been offered him in consolation. Burge
nominated George W. Donahue of Ma*
dera for the place and gave him his
vote.
There was a grave fear that Step.,
pacher wouldn't serve, but when it
was announced that he would have to
swear In before he could draw his $8
per, he moved up to the desk at a gait
that showed he could forget the chief
clerkship and devote his time to his
country in some other capacity.
The well-known secretary of the
Republican State Central Committee
was given a hand as he crossed the
floor and a responsive smile drove
away all outward evidence of any
sulkiness that may have lingered with
him.
Postmaster Fisk, former Speaker,
occupied a seat on the floor beside
Assemblyman Jones of San Francisco,
and whispered some instructions In his
ear at intervals.

JAPANESE WILL MARCH INTO PORT ARTHUR TO-DAY
TOKIO, Jan 3. âThe terms of the capitulation of the Russian forces at Port Arthur were signed by the Russian and Japanese commis
sioners at 9:45 o'clock last night General Nogfs victorious army will march into the captured city to-day. While the terms of capitula
tion have not been made public, it is understood that, in accordance with the expressed wish of the Japanese Emperor, General Stoessel and
;the remnant of his garrison will be accorded all the honors of war. The capital is wild with rejoicing over the victory.

nnese casualties during the siege of Port Arthur at 80,000. Of the Rus
sian garrison of 40.000 men only 5000 were fit for active service in de.
fense of the forts when the end came. There are 15,000 sick and wounded
in the Port Arthur lH>spituls.
PARIS, Jan. 2.âA Chefu dispatch to the Temps says the officers of
the Russian torpedo-boat destroyers which have arrived there report that
the entire town of Port Arthur has been destroyed, including the hospital
in the northwest section.
CHEFU, Jan. S.âBefore the capitulation of Port Arthur the Rus
sians blew up the battleships Retvizan, Poltava and Sevastopol and the
protected cruiser Pallada They also destroyed vast sections of the re
maining defenses to prevent their luture use by the Japanese.
TOKIO, Jan. 3.âThe text of General
"Nogi's telegram announcing the capit
ulation of the Russian forces at Port
Arthur is as follows:
"The plenipotentiaries of both parties
concluded their negotiations to-day at
4:30 o'clock (on Monday). The Russian
commissioner accepted on the whole
the conditions stipulated by us and
consented to capitulate. The document
has been prepared and signatures are
now being affixed. Simultaneously
with the conclusion of the negotiations
Tooth armies suspended hostilities."
Marshal Yamagata, chief of the gen
eral staff, under orders from the Em
peror, dispatched the following cable
gram to General Nogi:
"When I respectfully informed his
Majesty of General Stoessel's proposal
â¢'fur capitulation, his Majesty was
* pleased to state that General Stoessel
, has rendered commendable service to
his country in the midst of difficulties,
and it is his Majesty's wish that mili
tary honors be shown him."
'. . TWO HISTORIC NOTES.
I General Nogi's report of his corre
spondence with General Stoessel was as
follows:
"At 5 o'clock in the afternoon of Jan
uary 1 the enemy's bearer of a flag of
truce came into the first line of our po
sition south of Shujtghiying and handed
a' letter to our Bflcers. The same
reached me at J* o'clock at night. The
letter is as follows:
" Judging by the general condition
of the whole line of hostile positions
held by you, 1 find further resistance
at Port Arthur useless and for the
purpose of preventing needless sacri
fice of lives I propose to hold negotia
tions with reference to capitulation.
Should you consent to the same you
will please appoint commissioners for
â¢discussing the order and conditions re
garding capitulation and also appoint
a place for such commissioners to meet
the same appointed by me.
" 'I take this opportunity to convey
to your excellency assurances of my
respect. STOESSEL.'
"Shortly after dawn to-day I will
dispatch our bearer of a flag of truce
with the following reply addressed to
Stoessel:
" 'I have the honor to reply to your
proposal to hold negotiations regarding
the conditions and order of capitula
tion. For this purpose I have appoint
ed as commissioner Major General
Ijichi, chief of staff of our army. He
will be accompanied by some staff of
ficers and civil officials. They will
meet your commissioners on January
2 noon, at Shuishiying. The commis
sioners of both parties will be em
powered to sign a convention for the
.capitulation, without waiting for rati
fication, and cause the same to take
immediate effect. Authorization for
such plenary powers shall be signed
by the highest officer of both the ne
gotiating parties the same shall
be exchanged by the respective com
missioners.
" I avail myself of this opportunity
to convey to your excellency assur
ances of my respect. NOGI.'
DENUNCIATION OF STOESSEL.
General Stoessel is being sharply
criticized for having destroyed the
Russian warships, attempted to choke
â¢the entrance to the harbor of Port Ar
thur and dispatched the torpedo-boat
destroyers to Chefu subsequent to his
Offer to surrender the fortress. The
Nichi Nichi says that while General
Stoessel made a gallant defense, his
action in blowing up the ships after
he had offered to surrender leaves a
lasting blemish on his military repu
tation. His act indicates a want of
sincerity and leaves no room for an
extension of treatment of him com
mensurate with the reputation won
by the bravery and gallantry of his
defense. The Nichi Nichi contrasts
the action of the Emperor in directing
that full military honors be paid with
that of General Stoessel.
, The Jiji characterizes General Sto
essel's "Ttction as mean and unlawful
and says that it should deprive him
of any military honors at the hands of
his captors. The JiJl also revives the
charges of Red Cross violations at
Port Arthur and declares that no
treatment would be too severe in flx
iijp the terms of surrender. The Jiji
compares the action of the Emperor
of -Japan with that of General Stoes
sel.
PEACE NOT EXPECTED.
Count Casslnl Says Russia Will Fight
Until Victorious.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2.âAlthough
he had no official news regarding the
surrender of Port Arthur, Count Cas
. sini, the Russian Embassador, had no
hesitation in reiterating what he has
repeatedly announced, that the loss of
Port Arthur would not have the slight
est effect on Russia's determination to
fight to the end. He said:
"Russia will pursue the war to the
end and the temporary loss of Port
Arthur, after such a valiant defense,
can only spur Russia on to ultimate
victory."
Kogoro Takahlra, the Japanese Min
ister, was asked to-night whether in
bis opinion the fall of Port Arthur
would hasten the end of the war with
Russia. Without directly responding
to the inquiry, he referred to the fact
that while the fall of Port Arthur was
impending and its capture by the Jap
anese inevitable the Russians had dis
patched the second Pacific squadron to
the Far East and notice had been
given of the intention to send a third
army to Manchuria. The further
prosecution of the war now, he said,
rested with the Russians. If they should
continue it Japan would be prepared
to meet them on sea and land.
"Will Japan now welcome any of
fers for peace that might be made by
Russia?" he was asked.
"Japan always has been for peace,"
the Minister replied. "The Japanese
always will be for peace, if Justice can
be obtained for all concerned. Japan
starte d in this war fighting for a prin
ciple and she will continue to fight for
the recognition of that principle and
the just attainment of her rights."
Concerning the fortress at Port Ar
thur, the Minister expressed the opin
ion that it would be so cared for by
the Japanese as to be prepared for any
emergency.
RUSSIAN FIRE SLACKENS.
Ammunition Exhausted During Final
Six-Hour B&ttle.
VNDON, Jan. 3.âTtye Daily Mail's
correspondent with General Nogi says
the capture of Wantai involved six
hours of the fiercest fighting, while the
attacks on the forts to the southeast
were carried on simultaneously. De
scribing the final siege, the corre
spondent says:
"The slackened fire at points in the
northern and eastern forts seemed to
show that the Russian ammunition
was faiiing. Their position was now
desperate. Great explosions around
the forts proclaimed that the Rus
sians were exploding their magazines.
Flames and smoke in the harbor were
followed by explosion after explosion,
which revealed the destruction of the
Russian ships. The Russians also ap
parently blew up two of their own
forts. The battleship Sevastopol was
blown up, and the other warships were
destroyed aa thoroughly as possible.
The battleships Retvizan and Poltava
and the protected cruiser Pallada
caught fire."

steamship Ardla, with two submarine
boats, reDortecs to be destined ulti
mately for the Russian navy, on board,
has occurred.
Just after a pilot had boarded the
steamship, which was scheduled to sail
at 4* o'clock, a stranger, whose identity
was not learned, appeared at the ship
yard and a few minutes later it was
announced that the vessel would not
sail.
Information as to the cause of the
change of programme, the destination
of the submarines and the identity
of the messenger is refused.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 3, 1905.
SAD PLIGHT OF GARRISON
AT LAST REVEALED.
Without Food or Ammunition
CHEFU, Jan. 2.âCommander Kart
zow of the Russian torpedo-boat de
stroyer Vlastni in an interview to-night
said:
"Port Arthur falls of exhaustionâex
haustion not only of ammunition, but
of men. The remnant of the garrison
left had been doing the work of heroes
for five days and five nights, but yes
terday it reached the limit of human
endurance.
"In the casemates of the forts one
saw everywhere faces black with star
vation, exhaustion and nerve strain.
You spoke to them, but they did nut
give answer, only staring dumbly.
"The lack of ammunition alone
would not have suggested the seeking
of terms. Scant ammunition had long
been common in the fortress, and dur
ing the past month many of the forts
had nothing with which to return the
fire of the enemy.
"The Russians sat in the casemates
firing not more than once to the 200
shots sent by the Japanese. Then when
the assault came they repulsed the en
emy with bayonets. But the men them
selves, Having existed for three months
on reduced rations, were so worn that
it is marvelous they stood the final
strain so long. v
BRAVE OLD STOESSEL.
"Yesterday General Stoessel would
still fight. His wound, which was re
ceived early in the siege, had been both
ering him. but his determination to
fight while one man stood had not been
diminished.
" 'But we cannot fight,' said his gen
THE END AT LAST!
'erals. 'Our men cannot move. They
sleep standing. They cannot see the
bayonets at their breasts. We can or
der, but they cannot obey.'
" 'Then you generals fight,' said
Stoessel, clenching his fists.
"He seemed fanatical on the subject,
but finally he was brought to see rea
son by the insistence of his subor
dinates. Admirals and generals, some- j
times with broken voices, urged the j
step which all had dreaded so long.
"I am sure Port Arthur would have !
sought terms a month ago had it not i
been for General Stoessel, who with
bulldog tenacity repeatedly refused to
permit such action to be taken. He had
told his Emperor that he would never
surrender, and he meant to keep his
word.
"The greatest loss suffered by Port
Arthur occurred a fortnight ago, when
Major General Kondratenko was killed.
Officers and men alike regarded him
as the brightest star in Port Arthur's
firmament. When his death became
! known, the fall in the spirits of the
soldiers was plainly visible.
KILLED BY BURSTING SHELL.
"General Kondratenko was seated in
the casemate of a certain fort, dis
cussing with seven other officers the
best way of countermining against the
Japanese, when an eleven-Inch shell
burst, killing everybody in the case
mate.
"General Nogi has taken Port Arthur
with his artillery and his tunnels. His
rifle bullets were seldom found to be
of use.
"We constantly endured a bombard
ment fiercer than any in history. The
Japanese periodically assaulted, and
then, if repulsed, they calmly resumed
their bombardments.
"We who came here to-day do not
know the terms of surrender suggested
by General Stoessel to General Nogi,
nor the answer to them, having left
Port Arthur even before the messenger
had been dispatched. The general im
pression, however, is that Stoessel has
proposed thart the army shall go free
and that he alone be made a prisoner, i
Even that concession seemed to wrench :
the sturdy old man's heart
"Whether or not the negotiations
terminate in an agreement on terms
of surrender, it is certain that Port
Arthur is doomed. We still have some
ammunition and some guns on Liaoti
Mountain, but that mountain is not
adapted for the be3t defense from the
land side, and the Japanese would find
Its capture easier than the other tasks
they have attempted. Tiger's Tail
Peninsula has to be similarly viewed,
and Gold Hill has been without am
munition for three months.
"Since reaching Chefu I have seen
that attempts have been made to make
it appear that Stoessel alone wished to
surrender, the other generals desiring
to continue the fight. This is a lie, and
it is based solely on personal dislike of
Stoessel.
AMMUNITION EXHAUSTED.
"It is a simple atory. Had the am
munition held out, the fortress would
have held out indefinitely. For months
we held Port Arthur by bayonets alone,
until flesh and blood could do no more."
When a man fell there was none other
to replace him. Thus the garrison was
gradually worn down. Two-Hundred
and-Three'-Meter Hill alone cost us 5000
men. The capture of that hill was
the beginning of the end.
"The Japanese artillery was excel
lently served. They had 400 guns bear
ing on 203-Meter Hill. They advanced
their trenches while their artillery was
shelling the Russians out with a show
er of metal and then occupied the Rus
sian positions.
"In personal combat the Japanese
was greatly inferior to the Muscovite.
One Russian could take care of three
Japanese in a bayonet fight and some
of our soldiers have records vastly
higher than that. The Japanese are
CITADEL IS D[TENDED WITH
THE BAYONET ONLY.
Foes Losses Are Enormous
good, brave soldiers, although I have
little liking for them. ,
"It has cost the Japanese 80,000 men
to take the fortress, while some say
they have lost more than 100,000. The
number of our own dead is not known,
even to the high officers.
"The fighting since August has been
merciless. When Rlhlung Mountain
was taken, 500 men occupying a case
mate were not able to emerge, so quick
ly came the Japanese rush. The Rus
sians tried to get out by the use of
their bayonets in the face of machine
gun fire. Thus every man diedâtrying
to resist machine guns with bayonets
alone.- The Japanese did not give them
a chance to become prisoners, but the
men would have preferred death any
way.
"Realize this end! Picture a fort
strewn with shells and you have a
picture of the end of Port Arthur.
FOES OCCUPY SAME FORT.
"One peculiar incident of the siege
was in fort No. 3, where for three
months the Japanese occupied one part
of the fart while the Russians occupied
the other. They fought ceaselessly, as
saulting each other and mining and
countermining.
"Once when a Japanese Prince was
killed the Japanese sent to negotiate a
truce in order that they might secure
the body from heaps of others which
had long remained unburied. The Rus
sians received the envoys courteously
and in an easy manner, as if they had
untold breweries working, gave thein
the last bottle of beer at Port Arthur,
with the idea of creating an impression
of plenitude. As a matter of fact, the
only real ration for three months has
consisted of rice, which ultimately
caused hundreds to fall sick of Icorbut,
a disease much like berri-berri. Last
month the rations were reduced forty
per cent.
"Nothing was thought too great a
sacrifice in order to Impress the enemy
that all was well inside the fortress.
"This is the first potato I have tasted
for two monthsâand is this really,
truly steak?"
CHEERFUL TO THE END.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 2.âln
view of to-day's news, from Port Ar
thur, pathetic interest attaches to a
dispatch sent by General Stoessel to
Emperor Nicholas and given out this
afternoon. It was written on the Em
peror's nameday, December 19, and
was as follows:
"We are happy to greet our sover
eign and offer our respectful homage
to your Imperial Majesty on the occa
sion of your nameday from Port Ar
thur, which we have now held for eleven
months, with the aid of God and your
prayers.' The spirit of our warriors is
magnificent. To-day, on parade, the
resounding hurrahs given in honor of
our father, the Czar, testified to how
potent is the influence of your Ma
jesty's rule and our traditional loyalty
to the Czar, our father."

AWAITING LEGISLATION
Numberless Changes in School Laws Desired
Senators and Assemblymen in Sacramento Prepared to
Rectify the Existing Evils.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2.âAt this ses
sioo of the legislature many matters
ol importance to the schools of the
r-'idte will be brought up. In discussing
these to-day Superintendent of Public
Instruction T. J. Kirk said:
"The most important educational
matters just now upon which legisla
tion may be asked are the following:
"First âReadjustment or change oi
method of apportioning the State school
fund. The basis for fifty years has
been census children without reference
at to how they are massed. Until aboul
UTS all school funds, both State and
county, were apportioned according tc
the number of census children, and al
that time a partial correction of the
method was made by a law, still ir
force and universally approved, appli
cable, however, only in the counties. By
this law the county school fund and thâ¬
State school fund after It reaches the
county are apportioned according tc
the number of teachers or schoolrooms,
one teacher being calculated for every
seventy census children or fraction ol
seventy not less than twenty. If the
teacher or schoolroom is the proper
basis for the county fund, why is it
not also for the State fund?
"Legislation will be asked authorizing
the State School Superintendent in ap
portioning the State school fund to be
governed by a rule similar to that
which now governs the county School
Superintendent. The justice of the
teacher or schoolroom basis may be
fairly understood upon reflecting that
it costs almost as much to maintain a
school of twenty children as it does one
of forty. But under the existing law
the school of forty children gets just
twice as much money from the State
as does the other. In readjusting or
correcting this evident erroneous meth
od some counties which are now get
ting more than their share of the
State's bounty must suffer a loss that
others may gain it, and if it could be
afforded I would like to see the State
add enough money so that no county
would be getting less State aid than al
present. Yes. 1 am sure that $S 50 In
stead of $7 per census child would make
good the entire loss to the losing coun
ties.
$400 SCHOOL DISTRICTS.
â¢ Second âA change in the law so as
to do away with what are known as
school districts. A school that is
worthy of existence at all should re
ceive enough money to maintain a re
spectable school. By these so-called
$400 districts we are now offering a pre
mium on poor teachers and short school
terms.
â¢ ThirdâA change in the law so as to
require an average daily attendance of
eight instead of five pupils during the
school year to avoid the lapsing of a
s* hool district.
"FourthâRestoring- to County
Boards of Education in counties hav
ing a population of 50,000 or more the
right to grant high school certificates
nn t xamination. In such counties high
schools and high school teachers are
numerous and a board quite as com-
I tent as the State Board of Educa
tion to determine the qualifications of
hit;h school teachers may readily be
found.
BURDENSOME TASK.
â¢ . ' The work that has fallen upon the
State board and particularly upon the
office of the Superintendent of Public
instruction in the matter of granting
special high school credentials has be
come burdensome, and neither the time
lor the opportunity is at present af
forded as I think it should be afforded
a candidate for high school certificate
to show his qualifications by examina
tion.
"FifthâAmendments to the County
Government act or otherwise provid
ing for deputies for the superintend
ents in a number of the large counties.
The best interest of the people and
the welfare of the schools certainly
show that it is not economy to deny
these officials absolutely necessary
"SixthâProviding for a normal
school building in San Francisco.
SeventhâAppropriations to meet
pressing needs at the university, at the
â  Polytechnic school at San Luis Obispo
and due allowances for maintenance
and encouragement of the good work
that is being done at the State normal
schools.
"There are numerous other proposed
â¢educational measures to which my at
tention has been called and upon which
my opinion has been asked, as changes
in the hi&h school law relative to tui
tion fees under certain circumstances,
engagement of the teachers for the
ensuing year, if not notified to the con
trary by a given date; change of date
for election of srhool trustees, and
â¢ ways and means for the Introduction
'of increased nature study or agricul
ture Into the schools."
BADGE FOR CHAUFFEURS.

SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2.âA Mil is to

license for automobilists, the license to

.Is said, will provide for a common

fusion that now results owing to the
fact that various machines now bear
the same number, the same num
bers being issued by several counties.
! The automobilists will also urge a bill
granting them the use of all county
, roads under certain restrictions.
| A bill that will interest every debtor
â  and every creditor in the State is in
i course of preparation. This bill. If
passed, will make illegal the assign
ment of claims for collection on com
( mission. To make assignments of such
claims valid the bill will provide that
| such assignments must be bona fide
â  and procured through the payment of
I a consideration without understanding
\ that such consideration is to be re
turned to the assignor in event of the
failure of the assignee to collect the
claim through process of law.
, It Is said that a bill will be Intro
duced repealing the statute requiring
; foreign corporations (corporations
! organized under the laws of other
States and nations) to file copies of
their articles of incorporation In this
State before they can prosecute actions
in its courts, and for the tiling of
which papers they must pay the same
| fee as that required of domestic cor
porations. It is said that many of the
I larger railroad companies will tight
: the bill on the ground that it is burden
some, the fee for a company capital
ized at $100,000,000 being $10,000. and
largely increasing with increasing capi
talization. There will be a hot fight if
an attempt is made to repeal this bill,
for Its repeal, it is said, will mean the
loss of millions to the State.
An act of legislation that will be
pressed by commercial organizations
and business men of the State generally
is for an amendment of the constitu
; tion in relation to the custody of public
moneys. First, the Legislature will be
asked to repeal the penal clause of the
law, which makes It a punishable
offense for city, county or State Treas
urers to deposit public moneys in
banks. The proposed act, probably
providing for a constitutional amend
, ment, contemplates that the city and
county Treasurers may deposit the
, money in their charge in banks desig
-1 nated for the purpose, the banks to
give ample security in the shape of
] Government, State or municipal bonds
or first mortgage bonds, and pay inter
! est on the deposits.
WOULD SAVE FORESTS.
Bill to Prevent Fires on State Timber
Lands.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2.âA bill will
be presented by Assemblyman W. A.
Johnstone of San Dlmas, to provide a
penalty against setting out fires in
brush and timber on State lands, where
they will sweep into the forest reser
vations, and authorizing the Govenor
to appoint the Federal forest rangers
as State fire wardens, with author
ity to arrest violators. Statistics in
the forest rangers' supervisor's of
fice show that three-fourths of the
fires, and all of the bad ones, that
have damaged the forest reserves,
started outside of the reserve limits.
The bill was prepared by a committee
of Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce
members and is indorsed by the State
Board of Trade.
Johnstone will also Introduce a bill
to change existing road laws so as to
permit a larger expenditure of the
road fund for main road purposes.
A State aid road law similar to those
in successful operation In New York,
New Jersey and Connecticut will also
be presented by Assemblyman John
stone as will a bill to change commit
ments of girls to State Reform Schools,
so that they may be held until twenty
one years of age. At present any girl
can leave the school as soon as she
become eighteen years of age with the
result that most of them immediately
return to the surroundings from which
they were taken. Another bill that
will be Introduced by Johnstone, if
passed, will compel commission mer
chants to furnish a statement of per
sons to whom goods are sold, upon de
mand of shipper.
Senator John N. Anderson of Orange
County will introduce a bill asking for
a graded salary for Justices of the
Peace and Constables in counties of
the fifteenth class in substitution for
the fee system now in vogue. He will
also introduce another bill authorizing
Judges of Superior Courts to allow a
certain per diem fee to counsel ap
pointed to defend indigent persons
charged with crime who plead not
guilty and ask for counsel.
TAX REFUNDING BILL.
Measure for Relief of San Franciscans
to Be Introduced.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2.âAssembly
man Treadwell of San Francisco will
introduce a bill providing for the re
payment of taxes which the Superior
Court haa decided were Illegally col
lected In San Francisco. The drain
age tax and Montgomery-avenue ex
tension tax are included. All the
large taxpayers who paid under pro
test have had their money refunded,
but the small taxpayer, not having
taken that precaution, cannot have
It repaid under the present law.
Treadwell will also instroduce a
bill regulating the fees of attorneys
in probate proceedings. The bill will
reduce the present fees paid to ad
ministrators and fix a schedule of at
torneys' fees.
A bill making it unlawful to issue
so-called trading stamps will be
fathered by Treadwell. Such bills
have been passed In other States.
Many of them have been held invalid,
but Treadwell's bill Is believed to be
free from constitutional objection.
A bill regulating policies issued by
title insurance companies Is also to
be introduced by Treadwell. It Is
claimed that the present policies are
no protection to the property owner.
Marc Anthony will present bills
providing for the recall by voters of
criminal office holders, for State civil
service, and to increase the salary of
Superior Judges in San Francisco to
$6000 a year.
Senator Woodward will introduce a
bill asking for an appropriation of i
$50,000 for an administration build-
Ing at the Home for Feeble-minded
Children at Glen Ellen; also for a sun
corridor at the cottages recently con
structed there from the appropriation
given at the last session. He will also
Introduce a measure tending to clas
sify cities into grodps. in which a cer
tain amount will be necessary to
transact business as a trust company, j
This bill will be modeled after the 1
present banking act.

Olmsted also has several bills of
minor importance, in addition to a
bill to perfect the title to salt marsh ]

San Franciscans in Caucus.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2.âThe Sen
ate delegation of San Francisco
caucused at' 3 o'clock. Senator
R. J Welch was elected chairman and
Joseph Jordan secretary. After some
discussion the delegation agreed upon
a resolution which It will present to |
the Senate to-morrow, providing that
all proposed legislation in any way
affecting San Francisco shall be first
submitted to the San Francisco dele
gation and by that body presented to
the Senate for its action.
"Many outside county people imag
ine that it Is their destiny on earth
to interfere with conditions in San
Francisco," said one of the San Fran
ciscans this evening, "and we propose
to end their Interference this session if
possible. If the Senate will stand by
us and declare that we are to be the
judges of what San Francisco wants,
much trouble will be avoided, even
though it does deprive some country
delegate of the pleasure of posing as a
reformer, a promoter of civic progress ,
or the active molder of the policy to be 1
pursued by an imperial city."
The Senate committees have not as
yet been named. It is said, however,
that Lukens will be the chairman of
the Judiciary Committee. Leavltt of

Bhaw of that on Finance and Pendleton '
of that on Corporations. It is the opin
ion that these committees will be
named to-morrow.
settled upon $10 a day per member, by
a vote of thirty-eight to thirty-two.
The Democrats probably will be
counted in on the patronage deal. The
San Francisco delegation has elected
Frank McGowan as its chairman. It
is probable that Stanton will be made
chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee. Walsh may be given the
chairmanship of the Judiciary Commit
tee as a balm for his defeated Speaker
ship aspirations, though Duryea It
mentioned for the honor. Other
chairmen probably will be Bliss, Banks
and Banking; Dorsey, Claims; Tran
sue, Commissions and Public Expendi
tures, and Slavin, Education.

BUDAPEST, Hungary, Jan. 1â
Emperor Francis Joseph, King of Hun
gary, arrived here this evening. He
was met at the station by a great
crowd, which gave him an enthusiastic
New Year's welcome. The King will
read the speech from the throne before
the members of Parliament on Wednes
day. Â«
Count Albert Apponyi said to-night
that to-morrow he would formally
throw his lot with the Independent
p*arty, whose president is Francis Kos
suth. The news doubtless will cause
a great sensation in political circles
here, as rumors of the Count's intention
have not been taken seriously, but
only as a threat. To the Independent
party the accession of a politician of
the prominence and experience of
Count Apponyi will be a great gain.
He will take with him the members of
the National party, numbering about
twenty, and is likely to assume the
position 'of leader In the Chamber of
Deputies, while Herr Kossuth remains
president of the Independent party,
Politicians regard Count Apponyi's
action as a probable death blow to his
political prospects, destroying forever
his hope of becoming president of the
Council.

PROTEST FROM
THE ISLANDS
Special Correspondence of The Call.
HONOLULU. Dec. 27.â1n Governor
Carter's annual report is incorporated
a paper on the coffee industry of Ha
waii, prepared by William W. Bruner.
Bruner attacks the commisary de
partment of the army in San Francis- .
co. He says:
Aa a matter of fact, the commissary depart
ment of the army In San Francisco. In Its
specifications for coffee to be supplied to It.
contains a Joker which absolutely precludes the
use of Hawaiian coffee. The specifications call
for samples of various coffees, including Ha
waiian, which may all be blended except the
sample of Hawaiian coffee, which cannot be
blenoed. This absolutely prevents the use of
Hawaiian coffee, for ltÂ« is high-grade coffee t
and certainly cannot compete with similar
grades of other coffees which have the privi
lege of being blended with cheaper coffees.
This Is rank discrimination again*! Hawaiian i
coffÂ«e by an important Government department;
In fact, to be fair to the Hawaiian producer,
as Ban Francisco is the principal market for
his coffee, the specifications should call for i
samples which must contain not less than SO
per cent Hawaiian coffee. While there haÂ«
been in Porto Rico, and to some extent here, a
demand that the Federal Government should
help the coffee producers In some way, either
by bounty or protection, they at least might
hope to secure the support of the Government
by the use of only American coffee In the army
ant navy.
The Hawaiian and Porto Rlcan coffee grow
ers are injured In the market which belongs to I
them by reason of the Immense amounts of
low-grade coffees imported. The competition
with the" superior grades they can and should
stand. Eliminate the poorer grades of coffee
and triage and prohibit their Importation t)y an
act similar to the tea Inspection act of IK')7
and the American consumer will get good coffee !

FRIENDS OF GOVERNOR PEABODY WIN SPEAKERSHIP
FIGHT IN COLORADO LEGISLATURE.
DENVER, Jan. 2.âThe cause of
Governor Peabody made a distinct gain
this afternoon, when the Republican
caucus selected W. H. Dickson of this
city as Speaker of the next House of
the Colorado Legislature. Although
Dickson has been a resident of this
State for three years, he has not been
active in the interest of any Repub
lican faction, but his candidacy was
pushed by the friends of Governor Pea
body, and his selection by the caucus
is regarded with much complacency by
the Peabody people.
The Republican leaders have not
yet determined positively upon their
line of action after the Legislature is
opened. It is possible that Harry Crid
dle, one of the three members of the
City Election Commission, may present
a report to the Legislature declaring
that there was much fraud perpetrated
in Denver against the candidacy of
Governor Peabody, while his two fellow
Commissioners will simply certify to
the election returns less those districts
thrown out by the Supreme Court.
The Legislature would then have for
its consideration practically a majority
and minority report on the result of
the election in the city of Denver. Some
of the leading Republican politicians
say that this will not be done, but the
attorneys who are handling the case
for Governor Peabody say that it may
be done.
Another plan that Is meeting with
favor among many members of the
Legislature is to follow the action of
the Supreme Court In reviewing the
ballots In this city. As soon as the
Supreme Court has finished with a cer
tain number of precincts the Legisla
ture Is to take them up and conduct its
own examination along lines similar to
those employed by the Supreme Court.
It would be months before the execu
tive committee having this recount in
charge would be prepared to report.
The Republican leaders have no hesi
tancy In declaring that the first thing
they will do is to unseat the Demo
cratic Senators, Born and Healy, who,
two years ago, were given the seats of
the Republicans, Dick and McDonald.
There are four other Democratic Sen
ators who may share the fate of Born
and Healy. although it has not yet
been definitely decided that they will
be unseated. The Republicans base pos
sible action in these four cases on the
public statements of ex-Congressman
Shafroth, who announced that 7000
fraudulent votes had been cast for him
at his election.

C ase Gives Out Statement
SCORES POLITICAL KING
Says That the Revelations
of Conspiracy and Crime
Are Only Just Beginning
Francis J. Heney of the San Fran
cisco bar, the special United States At
torney who procured the indictment of
Senator John H. Mitchell and Repre
sentative Binger Hermann of Oregon
and the removal of United States Dis
trict Attorney John H. Hall, in connec
tion with the Oregon land frauds, re
turned to San Francisco yesterday. In
speaking of the cases involved, Mr.
Heney said:
ThÂ» extent of the land fraud ease* la Ore
fon la tar greater than J Imagined, even after
learned the extent of the Hyde-Benson frauds
through my oonnectlon' with the prosecution
of that oase. Oregon Is under the domination
of a corrupt political line, which hesitates at
nothing to accomplish Its ends. Hundreds of
thousands of acres of the finest timber land
In the world hare been secured from the
United States within the paat fire years by
half a do sen individuals, through fraud, per
jury and subornation of perjury. The good
people of Oregon wUI be as much astounded
when they hear the evidence In the case
against Senator Mitchell and Congressman
Hermann as they were when they heard the
evidence In the case of Puter. MoKlnley and
others, which has already been tried, and In
which the defendants were convicted. The
case against Mitchell and Hermann does not
depend In the slightest degree upon the testi
mony of Puter and McKlnley. The evidence
la sufficient to warrant and sustain a
tton without placing either of them upon the
stand as a witness. I have firmly adhered
and will continue firmly to adhere to the
principle that no man ought to be Indicted
upon the testimony of an accomplice or of a
convicted person unless that testimony is cor
roborated oy other evidence as to svsrjr ma
terial Issue and circumstance.
The Indictments already procured touch only
ths edge of the vast frauds which have been
perpetrated in Oregon. The Orand Jury and
I have fully a month's work ahead of us and
X expect to procure the indictment of at least
a dozen prominent and wealthy persons who
have profited most by these frauds.
HALL'S REMOVAL.
I was reluctantly compelled to request the
President summarily to remove John. H. Hall,
United States Attorney for Oregon, for reasons
which I deemed amply sufficient and which f
will make public in detail at the proper time
and Just as soon as is compatible with the
best interests of Justice. It may become
necessary for me to request the removal of
certain other Federal officeholders In Oregon
before we complete our investigation, but I
recognize the grave responsibility which rests
upon me in making such requests and am
proceeding with the utmost caution and will
not ask the President to act until I am in
possession of unimpeachable evidence of the
Improper conduct of such officers.
In October, 1903. I was tendered a position
a* a regular assistant to the Attorney General
at Washington by the then Attorney General.
Hon. P. C. Knox, upon purely personal
jsi unda, and I declined the appointment solely
i*ason of the fact that I could not afford
sacrifice, my civil practice here by thus
. king my permanent residence at Washlng
> I> C. In November. 1903, Attorney General
Knox urged me to accept employment as Sfpe
cial Assistant Attorney General to prosecute
the land fraud cases In which Puter. McKln
ley. Ware and Watson had been Indicted at
Portland on October 29 of that same year
and I accepted the employment with great
reluctance because I feared It would require
my absence from my business here for the
greater part of a month. Had I realized the
amount of work and the time which would be
required thoroughly to exploit the land frauds
in Oregon I would have declined the appoint
ment on business grounds but. having once
gone Into the fight. I feel morally bound to
complete It at whatever sacrifice to my own
business interests, since It would be difficult
for any other attorney to pick up the threads
where I left them and secure equally good re
sults.
CLAIM SPtTEWORK.
My success up to tha present time in these
prosecutions is due primarily and almost en
tirely to the great moral influence which the
ruggedly honest character of our honored
President. Theodore Roosevelt, Is exercising
over the people of the United States. It has
reached into every mansion, home and hamlet
' throughout every State and Territory in the
Union. John H. Mitchell and Blnger Her
mann realize that fact and it is for this reason
that they are loudly proclaiming and vigor
ously asserting that the present attempt to
stop graft in the State of Oregon is merely
the result of a spiteful desire for vengeance
against them by the Hon. E. A. Hitchcock.
Secretary of the Interior.
It Is a matter of general knowledge In Wash.
Ington. D. C, that ths removal of Blnger Her
mann wss requested by the Secretary of the
Interior, by reason of the fact that, as Com
missioner of the General Land Office, he sup
pressed from the Secretary of the Interior In
formation which reached him from Arizona ex
posing the vast extent and character of the
Hyde-Benson land frauds. From that day to
this Hermann and Mitchell have been violently
attacking and abusing Secretary Hitchcock, but
the latter has steadily pursued the Investiga
tion of land frauds throughout the United
States and has earnestly insisted upon the
prosecution of all offenders, both high and low,
.without discrimination.
When I was first appointed by Attorney
General Knox to prosecute the Oregon land
fraud cases ths political ring at Portland set
to work to discount my efforts the moment they
discovered that I was probably the kind of
man who could not be handled. In pursuance
of their plans a letter was addressed and sent
to Attorney General Knox on December 10,
1908, abusing him for appointing me. This
letter was signed by both the Senators from
Oregon, the name of John H. Mitchell appear
ing first. From recent developments it Is ob
vious that the reasons given In this letter for
the attack upon Attorney General Knox did
not constitute the real motive which was be
hind tha letter. It Is quite evident that John
H. Michell then feared exactly what has hap
pened, towit: a vigorous prosecution which
could not be diverted or thwarted by political
or any other kind of Influence, and which
â¢would Inevitably expose his own connection
with the frauds.
REFUSED TO RETURN.
Senator Mitchell refused to return to Port
land as a witness In the case against Puter,
McKlnley et al., although in my telegram sub
poenaing him I explained the great Importance
and materiality of his testimony, and I only
succeeded in making the proper connection in
the evidence by calling Mr. Richards the
present Commissioner of the General Land Of
fice, away from his important duties, on one
hour's notice, for that purpose. It la claimed
that I flooded the newspapers with statements
that Mitchell was connected with the fraud for
ten days before he started for Oregon: but the
fact is no intimation was given in any news
paper through me. or otherwise, to my knowl
edge, that Senator Mitchell was criminally con.
nected with the frauds until the day before
he arrived in Portland. He and Blnger Her
mann returned to Portland of their own mo
tion upon the strength of a telegram which
Senator Mitchell received from Mr. Patterson,

GRAFTED WITH
RABBIT'S EYE
Effort by Unique Experiment
to Save the Sight of a
Young Boy in Philadelphia
DELICATE OPERATION
Â«> *
Three * Weeks to Be Re
quired Before Result Can
Be Definitely Ascertained
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. 2.âParts of
the eye of a rabbit have with skillful
nicety been grafted to the eye of a boy
at a hospital here. The patient is doing
well and the surgeons are hopeful that
with care the delicate operation may
save his sight.
Francis Smith, 8 years old, Is the pa
tient. While playing with some com
panions around building operations he
got some lime in his eye. Smith was
sent to the hospital. There it was
found that the lime had eaten into the
conjunctiva or transparent skin over
the eye. When the pain was relieved
the boy was almost sightless.
Drs. C. M. Thomas, Messeroe and
Speakman were called In, and the con
junctiva was taken from a rabbit's eye
and grafted on that of the boy. It will
take about three weeks to determine
whether or not the operation Is a suc
cess. In the meantime the boy's eyes
will be closed by heavy bandages.
the Collector of Custom* at Portland, urging: ,
them both to come to Portland Immediately
and defend themselves; as they were in danger |
of Indictment. Mr. Patterson certainly did J
not get his information from the newspapers, i
as he sent his wire more than a week before j
anything was published on the subject. More- j
over, during that week politicians had been j
gathering In Portland from every county In
which any grand Juror resided, and the pur- j
pose of their gathering is easy to guess.
After the resignation of Binger Hermann
as Commissioner had been requested by Sec
retary Hitchcock, and before the month of
grace allowed him within which to retire had
expired, he directed Mr. Muller, the chief mes- i
senger in his office, to destroy about thirty- I
five or forty letterpress copy-books, which
contained all the letters written by Hermann
to Oregon correspondents on either private or
official business during his entire term of of
fice. Many of the letters thue destroyed would
be Important evidence in the land fraud cases
now being Investigated. These books also
contained all the official letters written by-
Hermann to Arizona In relation to the Hyde-
Benson land fraud matters.
PRAISES DETECTIVE WORK.
The Attorney General is giving me his earnest
support and confidence, and without it there
would be no possibility of success. The great
est credit for the unearthing of these frauds Is
due to Special Agent William J. Burns of the |
Secret Service, who was assigned to the case
at my request, on account of the magnificent :
work which he performed In the notorious j
Dimmlck case in this city, and likewise in the
Hyde-Benson land fraud case. Mr. Burns is,
la my opinion, the cleverest and ablest de- I
tectlve In the world, and his success in Ore- )
gon in securing evidence has been phenomenal. J
I am classed as a Democrat and I have al- j
ways heretofore voted the Democratic ticket j
for President, but have Invariably voted In- I
dependently as to State, county and city of- j
flcera At the last election I voted for Theo- I
dore Roosevelt for President of the United j
States and I informed all of my friends and j
acquaintances that I intended so to do, but I j
did not announce publicly any change In my
party allegiance, because I was satisfied Cali
fornia would go Republican by such a large
majority that nothing I could say would affect
the result, and I further felt that a public
announcement might be construed by many
Into a bid for a political appointment and I
desired none.
I am proud to proclaim myself a Roosevelt
Democrat in every sense of the word. When
he was Police Commissioner of New York
City I openly avowed that if he ever was nom
inated for the Presidency I would vote for
him, and I rejoice in having had the opportu
nity to do so. I feel highly honored by being
trusted with the responsibility of aiding him
In his sturdy efforts to stamp out graft at
any cost and to establish a higher ideal of
American manhood In public office. In my
opinion he Is the greatest exemplar this coun
try has ever had of the Jeffersonlan doctrine
that "a public office is a public trust."
I make this public statement at this Mime
because I believe the people generally are en
titled to be taken into my confidence to this '
extent,, as we cannot hope to succeed in prose- â 
cutlons of this magnitude unless a wholesome |
public aentlment eustains us. Hereafter I shall '
let the evidence produced and my conduct of I
the case speak for themselves.
SECRETARY OF PORTLAND
GRAND JURY IN JAIL
Man Prominent In Land Fraud Case
Beats His Wife in the
Street,
PORTLAND, Jan. 2.âScandals in
the Federal Grand Jury, having In
charge the hearing of the land frauds,
terminated to-night in the arrest of
Carl Phelps, secretary of the body,
who was locked up in the city Jail on
a charge of being drunk and disor
derly. When seen by a policeman he
was beating his wife on Morrison
street. Portland's main thoroughfare,
and a large crowd had gathered to
witness the fight.
Policeman Austin was obliged to
call upon a citizen to assist him in
taking Phelps and his wife to the cen
tral station, where he was locked up
without ball. He fought furiously all
the way.
Questions put to Phelps and his
wife by Captain Moore developed the
fact that money that was to have been
used for the purchase of transporta
tion had been spent for liquor, and
they were without funds. As secre
tary Phelps possesses all the infor
mation that has been before the Grand
Jury, and Is liable to severe punish
ment for his conduct. This Is the sec
ond scandal in the Grand Jury.
MITCHELL GETS A TIP.
Invited to Stay Away From Senate Till
Cleared of Charges.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2.âSenator
John H. Mitchell of Oregon, who has
been indicted by the Federal Grand
Jury in Oregon for an alleged consplr
acy In land frauds perpetrated in that
State, has been given an intimation
that it will be best for him to remain
away from the Senate chamber until

BOUNDLESS FUN
AT THE CENTRAL
"Child Slaves of New York"
Keeps the Audience in
Good Humor for Hours
They may talk about Port Arthur,
but give me New York every time
when it comes to shooting. If you care
for conviction on this point take in
"The Child Slaves of New York" up at
the Central this week. The drama Is
by Howard Hall, but the gun's the
thing. Three shots a minute, and the
play Is yours. They all go a-gunnlng
In It. There is even a girl behind the
gun. Lavishly they always do things
up at the Central, but the waste, the
splendiferous, gorgeous waste of pow
der here! It suggests Christmas sales.
It shrieks of the bargain counter. Or,
one wonders again, if Gadski's hus
band, Mr. Tauscher, who Is here to pro
mote the introduction of foreign bodies
into your enemy'sâmost ancient and
honorable of professionsâmarked down
some damaged goods.
Pistols only, and one could have kept
one's mouth shut. But when It comes
to Gat ling guns! It did come there in
the third act. It got there, too, by what
kept at least one hardened playgoer on
a continuous performance grin. You
see, the play does not run much to the
child slaves. However, they are all
there, with an Imported Fagln, who
teacnes them to steal. But the drama
concerns Itself mostly with a detec
tive thatâas the boy behind saidâ
"has Sherlock Holmes skinned and eat
en." He has. For sheer Johnny-on-the
spotness Homer Sherwood has any one
you will remember "skinned."
A good many of us have wondered
what kept Herschel Mayall In Central
melodrama. See him this week as the
detective and wonder no longer. The
fun is worth twice the salary. Dis
guised as a "Caramba!" dago, as his
own father, as a tailor's dummy, as a
Klondiker, as a Hebrew peddler and
such, Mr. Mayall has about all the
fun coming to any one In this Ibsen
epoch. Seriously, Mr. Mayall does some
stunning bits of character work here,
and when, after he has climbed Sown
the burning building In which the vil
lains have caged him, pulled out his
pistol to shoot the big villain, who still
pursues, and finds there isn't a shot
left, the house Is one groan. And here
Is where the Gatllng comes In. A police
boat manned by three "coppers" and
an Indian, with a huge, glided Gatling
gun snapshotting at the villain, bursts
upon the scene just asâyou know the
rest.
Danny Halifax as the detective's of
fice boy, Butts, seemed to have just as
good a time as Mr. Mayall only not so
many shots. James Corrlgan's Faglnâ
he has been cleared of charges made
against him. Senator Mitchell has left
Portland for this city, but It is prob*
able that in view of the intimation
given him he will not attend the ses
sions of the Senate, which will be re
sumed Wednesday.
Senator Mitchell's position is similar
to one in which Senator Burton of
Kansas was placed after his indict
ment on the charge of using his offi
cial position to aid a "get-rich-quick"
concern in St. Louis. From the day
of his Indictment up to the present
time Mr. Burton has absented himself
from the Senate chamber, and has not
attended any meetings of committee*
of which he is a member
Abraham Levy, they call himâwas
shotless, but an entirely successful
Hebrew. Julia Blanc was a clever
shot as Biddie O'Moore and an excel
lent Irishwoman. Henry Shumer and
Lloyd Edwards mostly handled knives
as the Gaspetti brothers, but received
none tho fewer hisses on that account.
Pryse Mackaye was the villain. He
fired the first shot.
Miss Myrtle Vane is the other lady
trusted with a gun. As Miss Junie
Hart, a "lady reporter" of peculiar
habits and straight aim. Miss Vane
was quite acceptable. Edna Ellsmere
is the adventuress, Ethel Clifton the
heroine and Baby Martine the leading
infant. All fill In cleverly.
I But if you wish to laugh see' "The
Child Slaves of New York." There
Isn't a chink in it for a yawn. >
BLANCHjj PARTINGTON.
Majestic.
"Held by the Enemy" ought to serve
to hold the friends of the Majestic for
the coming week. It made a promising
start yesterday with a special holiday
matinee and an evening performance,
both of which drew a good crowd.
There is much in the play to satisfy
the lovers of military heroics, with a
sop to the romantic who like to see love
get the best of duty now and then,
even in the disguise in which Gillette
puts it forth. And there is something
to weep for. If the story and the ac
tion do not produce tears there is pow
der smoke enough in the third of the
five acts to bring water to the dryest
eye. The laugh or two through the
serious parts of the piece are to be
charged to the clever efforts of Harry
Mestayer as Thomas Henry Bean,
"Special for Leslies," and in the last
act, where war is forgotten, his fun
blossoms with that of Elsie Esmond,
the Susan McCreery of the story. How
ard Gould frequently has the center of
the stage as Colonel Charles Prescott,
hero and lover, while J. H. Gilmour's
appearances are limited to four' brief
shows of his person, once dead, and
three times able to use voice and eyes
to captivating advantage. Adele Block
was a satisfactory Rachel McCreery
from the "suppressed emotion" point of
view, but she might do more and hurt
the part less. A part of the applause
was meritoriously bestowed upon
George Woodward, who portrayed a
typical Uncle Rufus.
Tivoli.
The last performance of "King
Dodo" will be given on Sunday even
ing. The Tivoli will then close until
the following Wednesday evening,
when the grand opera season will
open at this theater. Three days will
be devoted to the final rehearsals and
preparations on the part of the hig
organization. The members of tne
Grand Opera Company are now on
their way from Mexico to this city,
and will arrive here the* end of this
week. )
The sale of reserved seats for the
first week of the grand opera season
will begin, at the box office next
Thursday morning. The prices will
range from 50 cents to $2. The first
opera to be Rtit on has not yet been
decided, the choice for the opening
night lying between three very strong
works of the company's repertoire.
Columbia.
"The Sultan of Sulu" will continue
to reign merrily at the Columbia
Theater up to and including next Sun
*day night. The George Ade musical
satire has fulfilled every expectation
as to book and music and company
and production. The tragic story of
"Salammbo," as prepared for the
stage by Stanislaus Stange from Flau
bert's celebrated novel will be the
vehicle for the appearance of Freder
ick Warde and Kathryn Kidder at this
theater next Monday night. It is a
spectacular production, and one of the
most acceptable attractions offered
here In months. The Columbia man
ROSE FESTIVAL
AT PASADENA
Tournament of Flowers Held
on More Elaborate Scale
Than Ever Before in City
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 2.âUnder the
most auspicious weather conditions
imaginable and in the presence of a
great throng of 60,000 people, Pasadena
to-day held her seventeenth annual
New Year's feast of flowers, the cele
brated "Tournament of Roses." Never
before in the history of this novel mid
winter carnival has such a magnificent
display of floral decorations been seen
as that afforded to-day.
The parade of gorgeously decorated
floats, chariots, carriages and automo
biles followed the general lines of
former years, except that the use of
flowers was even more profuse and
the decorations more elaborate- than
ever.
The city itself was splendldlyi ar
rayed for the occasion, the scheme of
floral decorations being carried out
throughout the entire city. A series
of beautiful canopies and triumphal
arches embellished the principal
thoroughfares, through which the pa
rade wended between the long lines of
thousands of spectators. The pageant
passed in review before the stand of
the Judges and then proceeded on to
Tournament Park, where the afternoon
festivities were held.
Chariot races were the principal at
traction at the park, supplemented by
motorcycle races and other contests.
The celebration was concluded this
evening by a grand concert at the
Lowe Opera House and a ball at the
Hotel Maryland.
agement announces that owing to the
engagement being limited to one week
there will be matiness on Wednesday
and Saturday of next week.
The Chutes.
"Princess Fantan," the delightful
Japanese musical extravaganza, was
played to two packed houses at the
Chutes yesterday after a most suc
cessful holiday run and, this after
noon the regular high-class specialty
entertainments, for which the Chutes
is renowned, will be resumed. Among
the new vaudeville people will be the
four Gordons, phenomenal acrobats:
Dan Russell and Blanche O'Neil, an
Irish comedy duo, presenting their
original absurdity, "Sullivan, the
Coachman"; the Burton bell ringers,
musical entertainers of renown; Eld
ridge, who makes portraits and paint
ings in sand, and Sallie Randall, a ver
satile and vivacious singing soubrette.
The American blograph and also the
animatoscope will show the latest
novelties in moving pictures and the
amateurs will appear on Thursday
night. _

SOROSIS CLUB
DOES HONOR TO
CLEVER ARTIST
By Sally Sham.
A right royal time was on at the
Sorosis Club yesterday afternoon, when
it played hostâor is It hostess?âat a
reception in honor of Mrs. Sarah Ben
der de Wolf, the clever artist, who
puts on canvas flowers and fruits so
you can feel them, drink their breath
and all but eat them.
The clubrooms were made glad with
a forest of ferns, pepper branches and
the radiant poinsettia, and in the hall,
where the receiving party stood, a
crackling Are sputtered on the hearth.
It assuredly was the reception com
mittee's busy day, but a charming co
terie It wasâand right smartly gown
ed. Among them were Mrs. A. H. Vail,
the president of the club; Mrs. J. J.
Brice, Mrs. F. A. Wood, Mrs. G. J.
Bucknall, Mrs. Adele Brooks, Mrs. L.
L. Dunbar, Mrs. J. Fennimore and Mrs.
W. J. Landers.
During the afternoon over 400 guests
called," among them a lot of charming
menâverily, the men of San Francisco
are becoming more and mgre social
creatures. In the new year may they
give less tfme to grubbing and more to
social amenities'. Amen! And thus
will the world be happier.
On the walls of the clubrooms were
displayed the pictures of Mrs. de Wolf,
which rank with anything done in the
West, in the line of flowers and fruit
portraiture. A pleasant feature of the
exhibit was the sale of two of the
largest canvases, a rose picture and an
exquisite production of grapes, red,
amber and luscious âthe delight of the
disciples of Omar Khayyam. The pic
tures will be on exhibition at the club
rooms for the rest of the week, during
which they will lie, seen by many times
400âthe aggregate of the admiring
throng of yesterday.
Superb music from a stringed or
chestra accompanied the chatterâa
wicked thing, too, for melody of that
type should win silence and the atten
tion that cqmes of appreciation.

The "Sultan of'Sulu" company gave
a Christmas festival at the close of the
performance at the Columbia
last night,. It consisted of a minstrel
first part, followed by a vaudeville en*

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
PRESIDENT WHEELER
ASKS FOR COIN
..'WANTS TO TRAIN TEACHERS
: Will Petition Legislature for $30,000
' BERKELEY, Jan. 2.âProfessor E.
E. Brown, head of the department of
education of the University of Califor
. 'nia, received news to-day that a project
most dear to himâthe establishment of
a school on the university campus
where students of his department
might receive actual practice and
training as teachersâhad been formal
ly presented to Governor Pardee by
.President Wheeler and a committee of.
Regents.
Professor Brown said that the recom- !
inendations made by President Wheel- j
er. were, supposedly, part of the
result of communications sent by him J
.to the president on December 26 in con- j
nection with this subject. He had been |
Invited by President Wheeler to put in i
' writing the idea he desired to have ]
presented to the Legislature in con- j
nection with the matter, and to-day
gave out for publication copies of this
letter to the president.
It is the wish of Professor Brown
that $30,000 be appropriated for a build- '
ing where pupils may attend school
and be taught by students of his de- :
partment. His letter to President j
Wheeler is as follows:
After mature consideration the following rec- â¢
ixnmondations with reference to provision for a j
school of practice and observation are respect- j
Jully presented by the corps of Instruction of |
the department of education.
That a piece of land be set apart In the ,
northwest corner of the present university |
grounds rectangular in shape, approximately .
"400 feet on Hearst avenue by 600 feet on Ox- |
ford street, for a term of ten or twelve years, ,
for the use of a school under the direction of j
the department of education.
That the Legislature be asked to appropriate I
at the coming session the sum of $30,000 for
. the erection and equipment of a wooden build- j
ing on this piece of land for the use of the .
school.
That the current cost of maintaining the 1
school be defrayed from the general funds of
the university, tuition to be free.
It is estimated that the current expense of i
'the school for the first year. 1906-6, five school !
rooms being in operation, with about thirty ;
pupils In each room, will be $9000. With the i
..addition of other rooms, about one new room '
'being added each year, this expense may j
amount to $26,000 a year in eight years, at !
the. end of which time the school, twelvo
.grades and kindergarten, may be expected to
be complete.
In response to your request I beg leave to
submit the following statement of the principal
grounds on which the department of educa
tion urges the establishment at this time of a
pehool of observation, practice and experimen
tntion. The reasons are twofold, depending
lh the first place on the essenUal nature of the
work In which we are engaged, and secondly,
â¢ p the actual present situation in California.
IMPORTANCE OF IDEA.
. -Education finds Its place in our university
. acherne as an art. as an applied science and as
a profession. Practice teaching enters into any
..'adequate preparation for education as an art,
in much the same way that a course in free
' 4iand drawing enterÃ into the preparation of
â¢the future painter. As an applied science, a
v4ose analogy holds between education and
agriculture, education requiring its school of
observation and experimentation somewhat as
'agriculture requires its botanical and chemical
laboratories and its experiment stations. As
profession education requires its school of
'practice and observation very' much as medi
cine has its hospital and its clinics. Accord
ingly we find the movement toward the estab
lishment of such schools and the provision of
facilities for practice teaching approved and
promoted In some of our strongest universi
ties, notably In Harvard. Columbia. Chicago
and Missouri.
â¢ The consideration which I would respectfully
emphasize at this point is that the higher prep
aration of teachers cannot permanently main
tain a real university standing without ade
quate provision for such concreteness and ob
jectivity of treatment and such training to
expert efficiency as is found In other univer
sity departments.
The view set forth above has Influenced the
â¢ work of our department of education since
its establishment in 1392. By arrangement
â¢â¢with the school authorities of Berkeley and
Oakland some Inadequate provision for obser
vation, experiment and practice has been made
from the beginning, which was partially con
centrated in the Tompkins School In Oak
land from 1895 to 1899, and in other schools
was organized and conducted with great care
by Mr. Heaton from 1897 onward. This pro
vision has proved very useful, but at beet
ir has been wholly insufficient. In addition
t.>. deficiencies in other directions it has failed
lor the most part to offer opportunities for
teaching in high schools. And positive oppo
sition to the arrangement has appeared in the
Berkeley Board of Education during the past
year. We have accordingly for a long time
looked forward to the establishment of a
university school and the maintenance of such
a school was Included among the recommenda
tions relative to a teachers' college, which I
laid before you in the fall of 1902. The ap
â¢ pointment of Dr. Karrington to an assistant
professorship in the university was recom
â¢ mended last spring with the view particularly
to having him devote the year 1904-05 to the
working out of this problem of practice teach
ing, a purpose which he is now carrying into
effect.
PRACTICE NEEDED.
In recent years there has grown up a very
urgent demand on the part of school author
ities in this State that university trained
teachers should be trained in the actual pro
cesses of teaching. This demand has been
put -forward in many ways, of which the two
following are typical examples: First, a rule
of the Oakland Board of Education that in
experienced graduates of the universities shall
not be employed to teach In the schools of
Oakland unless they shall have completed suc
ressfully a course of practice teaching under
proper pedagogical supervision; second, a rule
of the State Board of Education requiring
such practice teaching of university graduates
, who are candidates for the high school teach
ers' certificate. We accordingly face this pros
pect. t n Â»t before long inexperienced graduates
O* the university will be unable to find em
ployment in the better teaching positions in
the State or even to secure the teachers' cer
- tiflcate without such practical training. It
is possible that the university might secure a
reversal of some of these rules by forcing the
Issue, but that could be accomplished only by
a sharp contest, in which the university would
be on the wrong side.
There Is a larger need which seems equally
dependent on the establishment of a university
school. The university ought to send out
specially prepared and competent superintend
ents and principals of public schools and in
structors In normal schools in this State and
Pacific and mountain States generally. The
. oa-U for such men hss become very urgent of
SCOTT'S EMULSION.
AS TO COLDS
Feed a coldâyes, but
feed it with Scott's Emul
sion. Feeding a cold in this
way kills it. You cannot
afford to have a cough or
cold at this season or any
other. Scott's Emulsion
vill drive it out quickly
and keep it out. Weak
lungs are strengthened
and all wasting diseases
are checked by Scott's
Emulsion. It's a great
flesh producer.

late. We find it impossible to provide ade
quately for the special training of such super
visors and teachers while lacking in adequately
equipped schools under university manage
ment.
The gist of the statements presented above
U this: That In the Judgment of the depart
ment of education the university cannot give
to the publio such educational service and
educational leadership as Is now reasonably
demanded of It without the maintenance of a
strong university school.
"I do not wish it understood," said
Professor Brown- to-day "that this
plan for training teachers is to compete
in any way with the normal school
work of the State. We co-operate with
them, and they, I believe, regard the
matter in the same light. President
Wheeler approves the project, I think,
and we hope for favorable action by
the State Legislature. Our proposal
for a building for use during a term
of ten or twelve years is made bo as
not to interfere with the Benard plan
for the greater university.
"I hope to see the time come when
we will be able to do as Columbia Uni-
versity does âprovide such facilities
that a child may enter a kindergarten
on the university grounds, go through
grammar and high school grades and
receive his university degree all under
the same auspices and on the same
campus.
"We propose to have students in our
department teach each one subject in
this grammar school room, with a su
pervising teacher over all. This would
give practice to about seven or eight
student teachers in each room. That
would be but the beginning. Eventual
ly we hope to provide such actual prac
tice for at least a hundred student
teachers.
"Our aim is ultimately to equip stu
d< its for supervising positions in
school work and to turn out high
school Instructors as distinguished
from the normal school's product of
primary and grammar grade teachers."
OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN
BUSY THE LAST YEAR
Records of the County Offices Show
Good BusinessâFew Prisoners
at County Jail.
OAKLAND, Jan. 2.âThe records of
the Alameda County Receiving Hos
pital show that during the year just
ended 3382 patients were treated at
the hospital. Out of this number only
29 died, nearly all of these passing
away a few moments after their ad
mission to the hospital. Eighteen of
the cases treated were those of peo
ple who attempted suicide by poison
ing, only one resulting fatally.
The insane ward of the hospital re
ceived 134 patients during the year,
91 of whom were committed to the
State asylums, and 43 were discharged
after examination. Drs. O. D. Ham
lin and R. T. Stratton, the surgeons in
charge, have every reason to feel
proud of the record of the year.
During 1904 993 suits of all descrip
tions were filed at the office of the
County Clerk. 333 of which were ac
tions for divorce. In 1903 there were
994 suits filed, 323 being for divorce.
A heavy Increase over last year Is
shown by the records of the County
Recorder's office, 23,831 documents
having been filed this year, as com
pared with 21,756 in 1903. The fees
received by the County Recorder
amounted to $33,258 05, and the to
tal expenses of the office have been
$25,861 45, leaving a net balance for
the county treasury of $7396 60.
At the close of 1904 there were only
37 prisoners confined in the County
Jail. The record of the year shows
that there have been 503 prisoners
confined there during the year. Dur
ing 1903 there were 735 prisoners
confined at the County Jail.
Fines and forfeitures collected in
the Police Courts during 1904
amounted to $10,519 50. From De
partment 1 $4953 50 was gathered, of
which $2989 50 went to the county
treasury and $1964 to the city strong
box. From Department 2 the total
receipts were $5596, the county's
share being $3509 and the city's re
turn $2057. The number of cases
handled was 4373, divided as follows:
Department 1, 2152; Department 2,
2221.
STUDENTS HONOR MEMORY
OF EDWARD ROWLAND SILL
Three Classes of Oakland High School
Erect Monument in Lafayette
Square.
OAKLAND, Jan. 2.âThe students
of the Oakland High School have
erected a mounment to the memory
of Edward Rowland Sill, one of the
ablest of California's poets, who was
formerly a teacher at the High School.
The monument was set in olace to
day in Lafayette square, where it will
be unveiled in about two weeks. The
monument is in the form of a bronze
sundial and is mounted on a base of
rough hewn granite.
The memorial has been placed n*nr
the Eleventh-street side of the square
just south of the High School. On
the Eleventh-street side is a bronze
plate, bearing the following inscr'p
tion: "Erected to the memory of Ed
ward Rowland Sill by the Oakland
High School classes of June, '98- De
cember, '99, and December '01."' On
the opposite side of the base are
following lines from the pen of the
hue poet:
Forenoon and afternoon and night
Forenoon
And afternoon and nightâ
Forenoon andâwhat?
The empty song repeats Itself. No more?
\ea, that Is life: Make this forenoon sub
lime.
This afternoon a psalm, this night a prayer
And time is conquered and thy crown is won!
Arrangements for the unveiling are
in the hands of Miss Sadie Drinkwa
ter, Miss Fannie French and Edgar
M. Sanborn.
Would Test Postal Law.
OAKLAND, Jan. 2. âP. R. Porter,
the editor of Porter's Weekly, says he
will test the present United States
postal laws. Mr. Porter wanted t*
have his publication entered aa second
class matter, but this the Postal De
partment refused to do unless he sub
mitted his subscription list to the in
spection of the officials of the depart
ment. This, Mr. Porter contends, is
improper and unnecessary, and he is
threatening a legal contest in the
Federal courts.
Supervisors to Organize.
OAKLAND, Jan. 2.âThe Board of
Supervisors will organize to-morrow.
As all the old member have been re
turned it is unlikely that there will be
many changes In the appointments of
thf. board. John Mitchell, the present
chairman, will be re-elected and the
committees will remain the same.

ing Track Kecord Time
LOS ANGELES. Jan. 2.âThe New
Year's card at Ascot to-day was the
most attractive offered during the
present racing season. Between 8000
and 9000 people were present. A stee- j
plechase, the Rose selling stakes, with j
$1800 in cash and a S500 cup donated i
by George Rose, and the first "baby
race" of the year 1905 were the fea>
tures of the day. The two-year-old
race developed a sensational sprinter
in Lady Walker, owned by J. E. Crush
ing. She covered the three furlongs ,
in 35 seconds, a second and a half be
low the track record made by Belle
Kinney last winter. Father Catcham
was second and Silver Wedding third, i
Williams' entry, Cash Box and Loyal |
Front, was the favorite, but Lady
Walker got a running start and was
never in danger. Catcham made up
a world of ground in the stretch and
showed he was a good one.
In the steeplechase the well-known ,
horse Galanthus fell at the first jump
and broke his neck. Jockey Nevins,
his rider, was severely bruised and
shaken up, but not seriously hurt.
Flea, the favorite, won easily from
Mrs. Grannan, with Cazador third.
The Rose selling stakes went to an
outsider, Luckett. at 15 to 1, leading
all the way and winning by a neck
from High Chancellor, with Evea G
third. Princess Tulane, the
played horse in the race, and Golden
Sunrise were left at the post. Elliott
and Ethylene, both strongly played in
the books, failed to get inside the
money.
Fossil ran seven furlongs in 1:26%,
a track record, and won the fifth race
from Hans Wagner and Tim Payne in
the order named. Fossil was a red
hot favorite. Hildebrand was the
strong tin in the last race and won
handily from Tarn o* Shanter and
Golden Light. Twenty-one books cut
in to-day. Weather clear; track fast.

vale and Edge of Alameda
MAN WEARS A MASK
John 3loir Is Held Up on the
Tidal Canal Bridge While
on His Way to Theater
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 2.
Footpads are still operating nightly
lin and about Oakland. This evening
I John Moir was held up and robbed at
| the point of a pistol at the tidal canal
, bridge between East Oakland and Ala- j
meda, and Saturday evening the Cos
mopolitan saloon, owned by John
Byrne, on the San Leandro road, was j
held up, though not robbed, by a high-1
1 wayman, who fired four shots and then i
escaped.
Moir lives at 528 Kennedy street, East
Oakland, and was walking to Alameda
to attend the Park Theater. When he
reached the Alameda end of the tidal
canal bridge a tall man In a mask and
with a revolver stopped him. Moir
obeyed the usual order to throw up his
hands, whereupon the highwayman
turned him around so that he could not
make close observations, took $2 in
money and marched him down Park I
street into Alameda. He then made
bis escape across the fields toward
Fruitvale. Moir went to Alameda and
reported the hold-up, but no trace of
the man was found.
The hold-up of the saloon on the San
Leandro road was more sensational
and less productive for the robber.
There were a number of people in the
place when a man with a flesh-colored
mask and carrying a revolver walked
in. John Byrne, the proprietor, was on
duty, and his first idea was that it was
a joke. When told, to throw up his
hands he made the remark that he
would "get his gun and see what would
be doing." As he said this the man
opened Are and four bullets buried
themselves in the wall, while the man
backed out and made his escape.
It is possible that the man who tried
to hold up the saloon and the man who
did hold up Moir to-night are the same,
as they are operating in the same gen
eral district.
LIGHT PLANT TROUBLE
WILL BE INVESTIGATED
Chief Engineer Joseph Messer and
Fireman Edward Duffy Will
Explain to City Trustees.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 2.âChief Engineer
Joseph Messer of the Municipal Elec
tric Light Works will probably be
called upon by the City Trustees
Wednesday night to explain by what
authority he attempted to discharge
Edward Duffy, a fireman, on Saturday.
Duffy was appointed to the position by
the City Trustees nearly three years
Bgo and he claims that it was not
within Messer's province to remove
him. That was the reason why he de
clined to pay any attention to the en
gineer's notice that his services were
no longer required and refused to
leave the works until the assistance of
Superintendent Joseph B. Kahn and
the police was invoked.
Duffy asserts that Messer has been
fattening a grudge against him and
making matters disagreeable, hoping
thereby that Duffy would quit his job.
Messer has been in the employ of the
city as enginer of the Municipal Elec
tric Lfccht Works for several years. He
was removed by one Board of City
Trustees, but succeeded in getting the
place back after being out two years.
Duffy has agreed to remain idle and

Save Her From Asylum.
OAKLAND, Jan. 2.âJudge Melvin
to-day issued an order for the re
examination of Miss Mary Acherman,
who was committed to the insane asy
lum on Saturday. Miss Acherman
came to this country a few days ago,
utterly unable to speak English. She
was lost one night and arrested. No
one could be found who could speak
toâher in her own language and she
became nervous and worried and was
supposed to be weak-minded. Since
her commitment her story has been
learned and some countrymen have
agreed to care for her If the commit
ment is revoked. This will be done
to-morrow.

May Have Been Murdered.
OAKLAND, Jan. 2.âPublic Admin- |
istrator George Gray is investigating 1
a rumor that John Spitzkie, who was â¢
burned to death at his hog ranch in
Upper Frultvale a few days ago, had
a large amount of money. Several
persons have said that Spitzkie was
known to have had considerable money â 
just before his death and it has been
suggested by some that he, may have
been murdered for his money and the
house burned to conceal the crime.
No evidence has been found as yet,
however, to warrant such belief.

MAYOR'S ORDER
NOW EFFECTIVE
His Honor Expects Little
Trouble From Execution
of the Sign Removal Edict
MERCHANTS FAVORABLE
Service of Notice to Be Fol
lowed Where Necessary by
a Compulsory Enforcement
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 2.
Enforcement of Mayor Olney's order
directing removal of all street and
sidewalk signs and obstructions will'
begin to-morrow morning. The first
move will be to serve official notice on
all persons maintaining such signs to
remove them. Street Inspector W. W.
Blair has been instructed to notify
merchants and business men generally.
Broadway and Washington streets
are the thoroughfares that will receive
attention first, these being the main |
busines thoroughfares. Not a vestige i
of an obstruction will be permitted to
stand after reasonable time has been
given shopkeepers to remove volun
tarily all objectionable sign boards,
bicycle racks and the like.
Mayor Olney has been feeling the
public pulse with relation to the sign
order. He expressed his gratification
to-day that the move had been re
ceived with favor by merchants. The
Mayor had been a bit doubtful lest the
drastic order should excite opposition
among business men, but it has had the
opposite effect, according to the re
ports that have been taken to his
Honor by police and street department
officials who have been doing prelim
inary work toward the execution of
the order. Concerning the regulation,
Mayor Olney said to-day:
Much of the trouble that could have arisen
over compulsory removal of the obstructions
will be averted by the voluntary action of
business men. It is a good indication of civic
awakening when they willingly undertake to
meet the new situation, although it means
some expense In getting rid of the signs.
Heretofore there has been a mistaken im
pression that the City Council or the Board
of Public Works had authority to grant per
mission to maintain sidewalk signs. The fact
is that no such right exists. The streets and
sidewalks belong to the people for their use.
No obstruction to their free use should be
peimltted and it is unlawful to obstruct the
thcroughfarea
DRUMMERS PLAY
AT BASEBALL
"I'll bet they'll be sore to-morrow "
So said a P. C. C. T. man to a U.
C. T. man in the grand stand at Rec
reation Park yesterday and the party
of the first part was right in more ways
than one. He was justified in posing
as an anatomical sharp because he
knew that mid-winter baseballists
reap a harvest of strained muscles and
stiffened joints after their sowing of
vaunted athletic capabilities. He was
right in posing as a seer and rtveiator
because he guessed that the son Is al
ways better than the father and this
was proven in the fact that the Pacific
Coast Commercial Travelers' Associa
tion was able to beat its parent organ
ization, the United Commercial Travel
ers' Association, at the great American
game, by a score of 14 to 10.
They played the whole nine innings,
too, which is out of the ordinary among
men who know more about high balls
and diamonds that wiegh by the carat
than they do about the horsehide and
the battle ground of the knights of the
hickory stick. But the road agents, or
rather the men who hold up the mer
chant princes for orders for goods that
sell, were abroad in a commendable
cause âthe Widows' and Orphans' Fund
âand the noble effort netted something
more than $400 for the charity.
It was a great game. There were
more features to it than there are quills
on a porcupine and the picking out of
such quills is a day's job. The techni
cal end of it Is Boon told. The U. C.
T., wearing abbreviated blue overaUs
and blue shirts scored four runs Tn
the first inning and held the basket
for goose eggs for the five rounds that
followed. Then, by an error, a wild
throw and a safe hit five runs were
scored in the ninth, which, added to
one made In the eighth, made the total
of ten. The. knights of the grip who
claim the Pacific Coast as their juris
diction got two in the first, six in the
second and four In the thirdâenough
to put the kibosh on the aspirations of
any possible competitor in the field.
The Pacific Coast boys wore brown
overalls and white shirts decorated
with red ribbons.
As is usual with the foxy boys who
are plugging for advantage in trade,
each side had something up its sleeve.
They chose to spring it in the fifth
inning. For the Browns, Howard
Friedlander, the "real hat man," was
supplanted by Sam Gorlinsky, "bashful
and good looking," who had speed to
rival an automobile. It was a delicate
reminder to Andy Mahoney, who
pitched the first half for the Blues,
that there was something faster than
the teams he used to. drive at Coos
Bay. The Blues filled Mahoney's place
in the box with Alva Posner, who
used to pitch baseball in Marysville.
They say he is going to be married
next month, which may account for his
wildness yesterday.
Nat Cahn played a game at shortstop
for the Blues that would have done
credit to a National Leaguer and then
gome of his friends were unkind enough
to ask why he had to be called through
a transom at Sacramento. Sam Hall,
who travels for a tent maker In Stock
ton, came down especially to play
third base for the Uniteds and escaped
with one run to his credit.
The persona who watch things were
full of admiration for Fred Bradley,
who carried his 310 pounds like a
winged cupid at first base for the
Browns. He fell in his glory, however,
in the eighth inning, when he had a
chance to reach third base and fell
midway with a sprained (?) ankle.
Then he went out and to the bench.
Bradley's honors were shared with
"Handsome Tom" Dunne, right fielder
for the Browns, who always met a
heroic death before he trod the first
bag.
There were two umpires: Carl Koe
nig, big as a mountain, and Michael
Fisher, of the Tacoma team. Mike
knew what he was up against and
carried an unconcealed six-shooter In
which the cartridges were blank. He
fired a dozen of them at_ those who
questioned his decisions arid when the
bluff wore out he was removed from'
the field by two policemen.
CLEAR TITLES
AND PROSPERITY
Much Permanent Develop
ment Results From Set
tling of Vexed Question
CONTRA COSTA GROWS
New Roads Building and
Prospects for New Rail
ways Cause Improvement
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. %
The development of Contra Costa
County has not been entirely along the
bay shore. While thousands of men
are now employed in this section where
there were but hundreds a few years
ago, much improvement has been made
in the fertile valleys that abound in
the interior. New sections are being
opened up; many new uses have been
found for the soil, and In the last
few years there has been an unusual
increase in the number of fine fruit
trees, vines and nuts that have been
planted.
Much of the Increase in agricultural
interests is due to the now almost com
plete settlement of all land title liti
gation. For years there was trouble
over the titles to valuable lands all
through Contra Costa County, partic
ularly in the section just over the hills
that seperate Alameda and Contra
Costa counties. Many have been
killed in the years ago over land title
claims and the litigation has been end
less. Clear titles were hard to get in
some sections, and this contributed
to retard the growth of one of the
finest districts in the State.
But much of this litigation has come
to an end in the last year, and final
decisions from the courts have been
handed down, notably in the case of
the famous Sobrante ranch litigation.
This has confirmed the title to some
valuable pieces of land, and the own
ers who got complete title from the
courts now feel that they can go ahead
with substantial development. A feel-
ing has existed for many years that
permanent Improvement might be
wasted through some decision of the
courts, but now that this uncertainty
has been done away with these broad
acres are being developed. This sec
tion is likely to be opened soon by
railroads. '
In the Walnut Creek section there
is a great development of the industry
that gave the place its name. Not
only are all of the thousands of na
tive black walnut stock, which are non
bearing, being grafted with the Eng
lish variety, but thousands of new
trees are being started.
In the great Moraga Rancho at La
fayette special Improvements are being
made by Albert Burton, the overseer.
This famous ranch of thousands of
acres Is owned by Horace Carpentler,
the first Mayor of Oakland, and is
leased under the management of Mr.
Burton, who is very popular in that
section. John Devlin of Glorletta has
undertaken the management Â©f the
largest single holding of this rancho
and is showing In dairy, produce and
grains what this section can do.
Supervisor Ralph Harrison of Dan
ville, who assumed office to-day, has
announced that he will endeavor as
supervisor to give all of this section
the best roads possible In order to
put them in better communication
with Oakland and the county seat,
Martinez, and to give them an outlet
for their produce.
JANES SHOWS
MARKED CLASS
The final rounds of the class singles
tennis tournament played on the Cal
ifornia Club courts yesterday brought
jut some interesting tennis. The
first and second class matches were
tiardly close enough to be exciting, but
:he third and fourth class players were
;venly matched and the scores were
;lose. George Janes easily carried off
:he honors in the first class, while Mel
ville Long had no trouble winning the
second class trophy. Moulten Warner
won the hardest match of the tourna
ment from Albert Kenyon and carried
>ff the third class trophy. Fourth
;lass honors went to R. B. Daggett.
The result of the match between B.
f, Nourse and George Janes was nev
sr in doubt. Nourse played his usual
iteady game but was no match for
lanes. The latter outclassed him both
n strokes and in condition. Of the
ictlve players Janes is undoubtedly the
>est in the club. By winning yesterday
md also by climbing to the top of the
continuous tournament he proved this
fact.
Melville Long occupies the same po
sition in the second class that Janes
Joes in the first.' He was easily the
oest in the class and had an easier
Lime winning than any man in the
tournament.
When Moulton Warner and Albert
Kenyon came together in the finals of
the third class a great match resulted.
Three of the sets were (5â4, one 13â11
and the other 7â5. Kenyon won two
out of three, but Warner took the last
two sets and match.
R. B. Daggett was given little con
sideration in the fourth class and his
victory came as a surprise. In all his
matches he finished strongly and his
victories were well earned. His per
fect cor.dltion had a great deal to do
with his success.
Several good matches were played
in the continuous tournament. W. B.
Collier again defeated R. B. Cornell in
straight sets and Immediately chal
lenged Janes, the number one man.
Dr. Bush and Harry Rolfe played a
close and exciting match. The medical
man won three sets out of four from
his opponent. â¢ The first two sets were
exceedingly close but Bush won the
last two easily. The winner Is an ex
champion of one of the Middle Western
States and has an excellent style. He
is a tall, rangy player and when he
becomes accustomed to the courts wiH
be one of the club's strongest players.
Many think he mlgftt at present beat
Janes. The day's results:

BUY DUNGAN PROPERTY
Old Building, Formerly
Occupied by a Bank, Will
Be Transformed at' Once
LIVERMORE, Jan. 2âThe thriving
town of Livermore has received a New
Year gift from the Town Trustees in
the shape of a city hall and municipal
building. Livermore, which is the
liveliest town In the great wine-making
and mining section of Alameda County,
has now taken its position among the
actual cities of the county and will
have a home for its municipal officers.
The building that has been bought
and will be transformed into a City
Hall was formerly occupied by the
Bank of Livermore, situated at the
corner of First and McLeod streets,
and belonging to the Dungan estate. A
partial distribution of this estate was
made recently, and this property fell
to Miss Jessie Whipple Robson, one
of the legatees. An offer was made by
the Town Trustees of 53000 for the
building, which has been accepted and
to-morrow the Trustees will formally
ratify the deal. The building originally
cost $7500.
All of the munloipal offices will be
transferred to the new building, the
offices of Town Marshal D. A. Smith,
City Clerk Wright and Justice Taylor
occupying the lower floor. The second
story will be turned into a hall that
will be used by the Trustees for meet
ings. There is already a fine vault in
the building, which will be used for
storing public records.
The Town Trustees, who have given
Livermore Its first City Hall, are:
Thomas E. Knox, Chairman of the
Board; Daniel J. Murphy, Charles E.
Beck, J. D. Ryan and F. Matheson.

Three Sturdy Bisons From Eaton Ranch

THREE BUFFALOES THAT ARRIVED YESTERDAT FROM MONTANA. THEY
ARE FINE SPECIMENS OF THE BISON FAMILY AND WILL BE ADDED
TO THE HERD IN GOLDEN GATE PARK.
The Golden Gate Park herd of buf
faloes has been increased by three
new arrivals from Montana, a bull and
two cows. The strangers came to town
yesterday in a cattle car and were
taken to the park in a specially con
structed cage built on a truck.
The three Montana bisons were
turned loose in a paddock near where
the spotted dear and the kangaroos re
side. For a while they trotted here
and there through the inclosure, snif
fing the wind suspiciously. But one
taste of California grass made them
feel at home.
The Park Commissioners, who take
every precaution for the welfare of the
buffaloes, found that the park herd
was in danger of deteriorating be
cause of in-breeding. New stock was
needed, so the three new buffaloes were
purchased from the Eaton ranch in
Montana. The importations are fine,
healthy speciments of the bison, and
all of them are 2-year-olds.
The new arrivals will be kept to

DRUG AND ROB
A SIGHTSEER
Actress and Waiter in 3lar
ket Street Resort Are Ar
rested for Taking Cash
W. A. Williams of Williams, Arizona,
I started out to see the sights Sunday
I night. When he awoke yesterday
morninc; he found that he had been
robbed of a wallet containing $1400 in
bills and of $100 in gold coin. He re
ported the matter to the police and
two arrests have been made. Lillian
Lucas, an actress in a Market street
I resort, and George Kennedy, a waiter
jat the same place, are in the City
j Prison and it is alleged that they got
i the money.
Williams, who came here recently,
has been staying at the Pioneer House,
48 Fourth street. He wanted to enjoy
life Sunday night, so he started down
the line and finally found a theater on
Market street. One of the actresses,
Miss Lucas, attracted his admiration
and after she had done her "turn" he
I invited her to join him in one of the
| side boxes and have a drink. The
| drinks came fast and Anally Williams
i announced his intention of going home,
jHe says that the bartender detained
him and insisted that he have another
drink. He consented, but when he
drank the beverage his mind became
almost a blank and he remembers
nothing mere than requesting that he
be sent home in a hack.
Joe Baruh, a hack driver, was called
; and drove around to the Stevenson
: street entrance of the Yesort. There
j the hackman picked up his fare. When
j Williams awoke this morning he found
that his Wallet containing $1400 in
greenbacks had been taken from an in
; side vest pocket, also that about $100
in gold had been extracted from
' another pocket. Detective Thomas
Ryan was assigned to the case by
j Captain Burnett and when he learned
i Williams' story he placed both Miss
i Lucas and Kennedy under arrest. Wil
liams says he was given knockout
drops in the last drink and that there
| was a conspiracy between the actress
j and the waiter to rob him. He says
!he remembers that Kennedy took hold
lof him after the drink was served, but
at the time he did not suspect what
he was doing.
Fight With Knives and Razors.
A dispute as to who would pay for a

contest over the place to hold the ball.
As though it wasn't disappointing
enough to those who wish to go that
the ball should be set for Saturday
night, which silences the bands and
stops the dancing at midnight, the
House has refused to allow the func
tion to be held in the Pension building.
The ball has been held in the Pension
building before, and it is greatly de
sired to hold it there again, because it
is most eminently tit.
The Pension building is a large brick
structure in-a park about half-way be
tween the treasury and the Capitol. It
is not esteemed as a triumph of archi
tecture except perhaps by the architect.
A high building, it is yet "all on the
ground floor." It is this feature that
recommends it for an immense as
semblage, such as is always the in
augural ball.
There is a splendid reach between the
floor and the skylight, with big pillars
upholding the latter, all of whiah lends
itself admirably to the schemes of the
decorator. Fireproof and with exits and
entrances to suit, it could not be more
desirable if built to order for this pur
pose of a ball. Its wide floor is now
covered with great chests of drawers
filled with papers without end. They
are arranged in streets and alleys, that
makes them readily accessible.
The objection of the House to lending
the building for the ball is nothing less
than that it would interrupt the busi
ness of the Pension Commissioner and
his army of clerks to an extent that
has been figured in dollars and cents
to a value of $30,000. Washingtonians
take a great pride In this quadrennial
celebration, as. of course, they should.
They subscribe liberally of their own
money to make it go. They look upon
the $30,000 as nothing in the debate.
The House has proposed the Capitol
building and the magnificent building
of the Library of Congress, but Wash
ington stands with the Senate in reject
ing both. The House is expected to
come to terms when they get together
again.
The price of admission to the ball,
men and women alike and no free list,
is this year, as always, and despite the
Saturday night limitation, $5. This
is one way in which the expense of the
ostentatious ceremony is recovered.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Opposition to the statehood bill seems
to be developing and nobody seems to
know just whether the measure really
has the large following that is claimed
for it or whether its champion*; intend
to use it as a weapon with which to
defeat other legislation. If the bill goes
through it is not thought likely that
the people will reject it by their vote,
notwithstanding the opposition mani
fested in Arizona. There will be a
thousand offices to fill in each of the
new States and the interest and enthu
siasm aroused in the contest for these
alone will do the business.
The new State of Arizona-New Mexi
coâif the combination is effectedâwill
be the largest in the Union, save Texas,
625 miles long and 329 miles wide.
Texas has 30,000 square miles the bet
ter of this. Representative Hodey of
New Mexico, an ardent champion of
the bill, declares that his Territory has
a population of 350,000 and Arizona 175.
--000, enough to entitle them, combined,
to a representation of three members.
They will get but two, being rated by
the census of 1900.
Rodey, who is well stocked with Ter
ritorial statistics, says that Oklahoma
and Indian Territory have a million
and a half of people and will rank at
once with some of the older States.
There are twenty-three States in the
Union less populous than this. In area
the State would contain about 70,000
square miles, about the size of Mis
souri. The land is exceptionally rich
for agriculture.
A bill proposed to be introduced by
Senator Stone of Missouri after the re
cess is intended to throw open prac
tically the whole State of Indian Ter
ritory to settlement. It will, if it be
comes a law, be the biggest chance for
settlers ever proposed at one throw.
Under the bill each of the 80,000 In
dians is allotted forty acres, the rest
to be sold to whites at a fixed minimum
price. Whether or not, this is intended
to influence the statehood bill is not
certain, but should they both go
through there is no doubt about the
boom it would give the new State.
â¢ â¢ â¢
New Mexico has been knocking for
admission since the time of California.
In 1874 Stephen B. Elkins, now Sena
tor from West Virginia, was delegate
to Congress from New Mexico, and he
had about arranged the matter. One
day Burrows, now Senator from
Michigan, then a Representative from
the same State, made a very effective
speech on one of those force bills that
aroused so much ugly feeling in Con
gress. Elkins was in the cloak room,
did not know what the speech was
about, but heard the applause. Re
turning to the floor he met Burrows
coming down the aisle and wishing to
do the nice thing took and shook both
his hands. That livtle unintended in
discretion has kept New Mexico wait
ing outside these thirty years.
The Democrats wouldn't believe his
explanation and declared that if those
were Elkins' sentiments he could go
to with his statehood bill. Elkins, now
a grave man of great avoirdupois
and wealth, will have a chance to say
whether the Territory shall come in at
last coupled up with Arizona and
against Arizona's will or stay out still
a little longer.
â¢ a â¢
The statehood bill Is liberal enough
in some things. It gives Arizona-New
Mexico 24,000,000 acres of land and
$5,000,000 cash as a school endowment
and treats the others as well. Irriga
tion will make the arid lands of Ari
zona available for productive farms,
ar*d as for other natural resources,
Arizona claims the largest forest now
standing In the United States, with
New Mexico next. Rodey claims for
the latter more iron and bituminous
coal than any other. From Silver City
alone 1000 tons of iron are being ship
ped daily for seven years to the steel
plants at Pueblo, Colo.
H. P. Wood, Secretary of the San
Diego Chamber of Commerce, has had
an office for a month or so where he
could display his maps, diagrams and
photographs of San Diego harbor and
beautiful San Diego itself. San Diego
wants a naval coaling station In her
harbor. The Navy Department has an
Ideal location save that a quarantine
station has been placed at an unfor

quarantine station be moved a little
farther along and clear of the naval
location. The Treasury Department,
which has Jurisdiction over the quar
antine station, has been slow to see

Perkins providing for the transfer.

While here Wood took the occasion to

TWO FOOTPADS
ROB SALOON MEN
Masked 3lcn Enter a Howard
Street Resort, but Fail
to Secure Much Money
Two masked men entered the saloon
of Fred H. Burmeister at 1901 Howard
street last night and robbed the pro
prietor and two customers, Benjamin
Kern and John Linehan. As there was
only a little silver in the cash register
their loot was not large. They got
$12 50 from Kern, $7 from Burmeister
and a few cents from Linehan.
Angry because they did not get more,
one of the thugs struck Burmeister
on the head with a revolver. Both
robbers were rough in their treatment
of the victims. After their pockets had
been emptied the three were thrust into
an anteroom and the door was bolted
on them.
Policeman Timothy Cronin, whose
beat is in the neighborhood, heard the
curses shouted at the three men by the
and he ran toward the saloon.
Just as he reached the door the robbers
burst out, tearing the masks from their
faces. Cronin grappled with one but
the thug tripped him up and threw him
to the sidewalk. Kern says that
Cronin made no attempt to follow
them.
When they were sure that the rob
bers had gone the three victims began
to shout lustily. Their cries brought
Burmeister's wife to the place, and she
released them. Just as they were let
out. Kern says. Policeman Cronin
walked in, saying: "Look at my uni
form. One of those fellows threw me
down."
The two thugs had evidently watched
Burmeister's place for some time, as
they had their work perfectly planned.
They were seen to enter an alley in the
rear of the place about 10 o'clock.
1 There they probably donned their
masks. They entered the saloon with
a rush, each flourishing a revolver.
Loudly cursing, they drove the three
men to the rear wall.
"Throw up your hands!" was the or
der. "Higher yet!" commanded one,
as Kern seemed a little reluctant.
j One of the men opened the cash reg
ister and uttered a volley of oaths
when he saw that there were but a
few dollars in it. "Where is the rest
iof your money?" he shouted.
j "1 don't know, I'm only the barten
der, the proprietor is away," replied
Burmeister.
i "You He,âyou," shouted the thug,
and rushing toward him dealt Bur
meister a vicious blow with the butt of
a revolver. Then the victims were
, rushed Into the anteroom and the door
. was bolted.
None of the victims could give any
adequate description of the thugs. They
were powerful men, a little over me
dium height.
Five men, two of them under the In
fluence of liquor, entered the saloon of
John McCann at 700 Church street, and
while three were assaulting McCann,
i the other two broke open the cash
] drawer. They were interrupted In the
i act by the entrance of Mrs. Kate Mc-
Cann and she was held by one while
the other seached a bed in an adjoin
ing room, where It was rumored the
McCanns kept their money. Fortunate
ly Mrs. McCann had previously moved
the money and all the men secured
' was $4 from the till. The McCanns
know two of the men by sight and the
police are working on the case.

Railroad Section Hand Expires in Uie
Operating-Room of a Dental
Concern.
Thomas Howard, a section hand em
ployed by the Southern Pacific Com
pany, died while chloroform was being
administered to him in the operating
room of the Hale Dental Company, at
702 Market street, last evening. How
ard desired to have a tooth extracted
and requested that an anaesthetic be
used. Hardly had the operation com
menced when he expired.
Howard came to the offices of the
dental company by appointment short
ly after 5 o'clock. Dr. Victor Orella,
one of the dentists, was present to ex
tract the tooth, and Dr. H. E. Vreelantl,
a physician residing at 631 Golden Gate
avenue, was present to administer the
chloroform. The gauze mask was
placed over the patient's face and Dr.
Vreeland started to drop the chloro
form upon it. In a few seconds he
found that Howard had no pulse, and
after lifting the mask it was ascer
tained that he was dead. Captain Bur
nett made an Investigation and sum
moned both physician and dentist. Both
made their statements and the police
are satisfied that death was due to ac
cident. Dr. Vreeland says the man had
a weak heart and the first inhalations
of the anaesthteic produced death.
Drops Dead Near Park.
Butler Smith, 54 years of age, a clerk
in a real estate office, dropped dead at
the corner of Twenty-fourth avenue
and Fulton street early last evening.
Butler was taking his evening walk
when he toppled over and expired. His
body was taken to the Casino, a park
resort near by, and the Morgue officials
were called. Death is supposed to have
been due to heart disease. Smith lived
at Broderlck and Fulton streets.

TUESDAY JANUARY 3, 1906
a \"O'i"HER storm has brewed in this city, originating in the
.i\ desire to keep pure and perfect the morals of Chinatown. !n
* that view of it the matter is provocative of derision. The
tiir.e. talents and emotion spent over the morals of our Mongolians
may be devoted to that purpose to the neglect of similar conditions
among our non-Mongolian population. The pretense that China
town in San Francisco is the sole location in which the stock follies
and vices of humanity are to be found does violence to the truth and
to common sense. The only difference seems to be that Chinese vice
and tolly is rather more screened and is flaunted with less offensive
publicity. v
These conditions are confined almost exclusively to Chinese
themselves, and affect the white population but little. Yet Eastern
tourists are taken through that quarter of the city and introduced to
gambling rooms and worse, but no one thinks of escorting them
through the red light district that is inhabited and frequented by
whttes, \\>e have never been able to understand why the vices com
.mon to both races are considered such a curiosity when practiced
by the Chinese. Is it because we expect the yellow races to be alto
' gether free of these things, and enjoy the satisfaction that is in all
forms of surprise when we find it otherwise?
ft is now charged, with much probability of truth, that the
Chinese pay for immunity and that police officers are the bene
ficiaries of a policy of prudently averted vision. This offense has
â¢ always had probable existence. But it must not be concluded that
the Chinese who offend high heaven by their sinful ways are the
only offenders who are willing to pay more for closed eyes than the
public pays for them open. The good name of the city is not spe
cially fortified by newspaper hysteria on the subject. It is far within
the judicial capacity to sift the evidence and find and punish the
guilty, and we have faith that this will be done.
The dragnetting and wholesale condemnation on no evidence
will produce no permanent good effect, while the judicial certainty
and finality will be beneficial. Nothing is gained by dragging in the
innocent, nor by magnifying the virtues of accusation at the expense
of the city's fame. In all large cities these matters are the problem
and often the odium of municipal administration. It was expected
that our new charter would automatically eliminate them here, and
it ill becomes the advocates of that novel instrument to bring into
use the microscope to reveal the errors and offenses that occur under
it. All these were foreseen and predicted by those who failed to be
enamored of the charter, and for this foresight they were denounced
as enemies of the public welfare.
Yet they were philosophers who knew that no phrases of funda
mental law, assembled together and printed and bound, had inherent
and self-operating virtues to cleanse public administration. It is
worth remembering that the more faith the people have in that mix
ture of printers' ink, paper, pack thread, paste and binders' beard,
called the charter, to do all things needful for uprightness of admin
istration, the less care are they apt to take in selecting the officials
who are to administer the law. If the charter itself be a mixture of
A-ray and radium, if it be pure government per se, self-operative
and always at work, what difference does it make who is Chief of
Police, or who is at the head of the city administration?
The reformers cursed all the evils of the city and put them on
â¢the old consolidation act and sent it into the wilderness as a scape
goat, carrying all the sins of the people, and made welcome its pure
and perfect successor, the present fundamental law. Since this incar
nation of virtue has been in force it has been observed that things
tfo on about as usual, only they cost more. The various methods
of human transgression are in operation everywhere, except in the
cemeteries, and the paths of dalliance on which men and women go
the pace are just as numerous and well lighted as they were before.
Perhaps the mistake is in making a charter for the good people
who need no government at all, but who would walk as uprightly in
the midst of urban temptations as they would in the wilderness, ac
companied only by their fishing tackle and bait. It is sadly true,
however, that we will always have with us those needful of the re~
straining hand of authority, and that among them are severalâ
white, black, brown and yellow of complexionâwho are willing to
pay the restraining power not to restrain. The Call hopes and ex
pects that justice will be done without fear or favor, and none can
expect more and none should take less.
THE City Council of Oakland is attending again to the water I
problem in that city. While some attempts are apparent to j
make use of prejudice and passion as motives of any action pro
posed, for the most part the deliberations are on the lines of reason.
Why not project such lines into the real business of the proposition?
To put in a muncipal plant in competition with the existing private
plant is not business and cannot be justified from any business view.
To make the proposed bonds a mortgage upon the city's credit is
not business and cannot be justified.
Any policy that leads away from these two propositions will
ultimately work such injury to that city as to discredit the repu
â¢ tation of those whose zeal causes such a mistake to be made. If
Oakland be determined to embark in that form of Socialism called
municipal ownership, it should be glad to deliberately take advan
tage of the opportunity to start right. By so doing the pace would
be set for other cities that wish to go into business, and there would
' be furnished an opportunity for the proper business administration
of the public plant, but if Oakland throw away all safeguards at the
start what will follow will be without remedy.
The bonding of the city to start in a business in a field where
a competitor is already equipped is a proposition so serious as to
justify the consultation of business men, whp have no personal gain
to make in water politics. The Call has treated ques
tion of municipal ownership as a purely economic issue. No answer
is possible to the proposition that bonds issued for a municipal plant
should rest on the plant itself and not upon the property of the
taxpayers. The plan to bond Oakland for about six millions for a
water plant means the embarrassment of the city's credit to embark
in a business that will have no profits in sight if a competitor be left
in the field. It will prevent the use of the city's credit for parks, city
buildings and other much needed improvements, all for the purpose
of buying a plant that has at present no existence and was con
demned by the only expert that has ever examined it. With a
neighborly interest in Oakland we advise her people to go slow and
keep the middle of the road in this matter.
OUR attention has been so long fixed upon the industrious mi
crobe as our mortal enemy that we begin to think that longevity
depends upon keeping him at arm's length. But there are
others, as proved by a recent case in New York reported in a medi
cal journal. A young man dressed in his best bib and tucker went
with companions to a dance. In the midst of the pleasure he was
seized with vertigo. Ascribing it to the waltz, he resorted to the
sober square dance. Still his head whirled. He excused himself
and with his friends started home. On the way they all took some
stimulant. Arrived at his room he immediately fell into insensibility
and in a few minutes was dead.
The Coroner was summoned with the autopsy surgeon. The
brain was found normal. Lungs, liver and kidneys were all sound and
the contents of the stomach were innocuous. The death was a
mystery until an examination of the blood showed nitro-benzine.
How did it get there? The smell of it was found in the closet in his
room and further search revealed a pot of shoe blacking with the odor.
"His dancing shoes were examined and were found saturated with
this liquid blacking, which had stained his stockings and his insteps

A NEW DANGER.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY. JANUARY 3, 1905.
THE LITTLE
GREEN HAT
IT was such a beauty of a hat; all
soft shaded velvets and shining
breasts, with a few creamy rosea
close under the brim.
"You never trimmed anything
quite so lovely as that, Miss Nannie,
said Josephine.
Miss Nannie blushed all over her
delicate old face.
"My dear/ she protested, then she
straightened up with a little gesture
of pride, "I do think it is a success
myself. I thought of you when 1 was
trimming it. Your hair has just
enough gold in it to go with the green
beautifully "
But Josephine interrupted her. "Oh,
dear Miss Nannie. I can't possibly
afiord that hat. "lou mustn't think uÂ£
it. Put it in the window and sell it
to some one who can have more than
one hat in two years," and Josephine
showed her shabby black turban, with
a much worse-for-wear feather.
"I will let you have It at cost, my
dear,'' began Miss Nannie, but Jose
phine stopped her.
"No, 1 must get used to being poor,
you dear, but, oh. Miss Nannie,"
cried poor Josephine, why couldn't
we have lost our money when
1 was old and ugly and didn't want
pretty things?"
The little milliner patted the girl's
hand. "It is too bad," she said, "and
1 wish you'd let me help you."
"As If I would," indignantly, "when
you have to do things all your life
that yoâ¬ didn't want to do. And now,
as I can't have a new hat, you must
help me plan something from these
old things," and she untied a package
and showed a conglomerate mass of
silks and laces and ribbons.
But while Miss Nannie twisted and
turned the inadequate materials, Jose
phine could not resist one more try
ing on of the little green hat. She
set in on her soft, bright hair and
gave a glance in the mirror, then she
whirled around with a startled cry.
Why, Jack Van Horn," she ex
claimed, "where did you come from?
Miss Nannie, you know Mr. Van Horn,
don't you? I'm trying on hats," she
continued, a little fluttered by the look
he bent upon her.
By Jove," he said, "that's a stun
ning hat, Miss Mason, I never saw
you look so well; it's most becoming."
'But I can't have it," she said with
a sigh.
His eyes showed his surprise.
"I'll come in again and plan, Miss
Nannie," she said hurriedly, and then
with a quick "Good-by" she was out
and off.
"And now, how can I serve you,
sir?" asked Miss Nannie, to her mas
culine customer, who stood looking
after the bright vision.
"Oh, ah, yesâl came in to get some
feathers, I'm making fliesâfor my
fishing," he explained; but she could
see that his thoughts were ramblingâ
"the green on that hat is what I
want."
"I haven't another feather like that
in the house," said Miss Nannie, "and
It would be a pity to spoil the hat."
"Well, I'll buy the hat then," he
said.
"Buy a whole hat to make a fly to
catch a trout!" Miss Nannie's tone
was suspicious.
The young man blushed, then he
broke out awkwardly:
"Do you think I could send it to
her?"
Miss Nannie stiffened.
"Miss Mason could not possibly ac
cept it," she said.
"Oh, I know," Mr. Van Horn was
gettting redder and redder, "not if she
knew it came from me. But she ought
to have it. It suits her beauty."
"Yes, it does," said Miss Nannie,
' what a pity that her father should
have failed at this time in her life."
"And she so infernally proud," com
plained the young man. "Why, I've
asked her to marry me half a dozen
times, and she won't. She "
Miss Nannie gave a quick cry of
pleasure. "Oh, then you are the
'Jack' she talks of so often.
The young man seized her hands
eagerly. "Did she call me that," he
cried rapturously. "I didn't suppose
that even in her dreams she called me
Jack," and his voice lingered on the
word.
"Perhaps I shouldn't have told you,"
hesitated Miss Nannie.
"Oh, yes, you should. You have
carried me straight into heaven. If
she can think of me as 'Jack' she shall
call me that, or my name is not Jack
Van Horn." Then he held out both
hands to the little milliner. "Help
me, Miss Nannie," he said.
"There is only one way you will

get Josephine Mason to marry you,"
said Miss Nannie, with decision.
"And that?"
"Work on her sympathies. She is
proud and she won't take if she can't
give."
"If she would only give herself,"
groaned the young man.
"You can't lose your money,"
Miss Nannie, "nor break your bones,
no~ go blind " then suddenly she
gs c a little cry.
She's coming back," she said.
"Is she?" cried Van Horn; then as
I'jephine entered, he sank into a
hair.
"I left my " began Josephine,
and stopped as she caught sight of
Van Horn's drooping figure.
"What's the matter with him, Miss
Nannie. What's the matter? Mr.
Van Horn "
"Everything looks black." moaned
the hypocrite, who had his eyes closed
and was telling the truth.
Miss Nannie gave a quick gasp, then
entered into* the conspiracy with a
zest.
"Pull down the shades, Josephine,"
she commanded. "It must be his eyes,
poor fellow."
"I wonder If I am going blind,"
murmured Van Horn.
Josephine knelt by his side. "Do
your eyes pain you?" she questioned
fearfully.
He put out his hands gropingly, un
til they touched her hair, then they
rested there.
"I am a bit more comfortable now,"
he said.
"Open -your eyes and see If you can
bear the light."
Van Horn blinked and then shut
them again.
"That this should come to meâln
the strength of my youth," he mur%
mured. y
Then Josephine gave way.
"Oh, Jack, Jack," she wailed, "let
me take care of you."
Every fiber in Van Horn thrilled,
but he was heroic.
"I could not accept such a sacrifice,"
he said.
"But " and there was a softness
in Josephine's voice that made Miss
Nannie scurry away, with a murmur
of "something to put on his eyes";
"but," and Josephine's voice was a
whisper, "it wouldn't be a sacrifice,
Jack!"
How' Van Horn was led home and
how he stayed for a week in a dark
ened room was the outward manifes
tation of his deception. Only Miss
Nannie knew the inward meaning of
It all and Miss Nannie never told. But
when the wedding came a month or
two later, she brought out the band
box in which the little green hat had
remained ever since that fateful day,
and Josephine wore It on her wedding
journey. Then, and not until then,
did she know of the ruse by which she
had been won. and out of the fullness
of her happiness she forgave her hus
band.

CARNEGIE'S
MOST TREASURED
LETTER.
ANDREW CARNEGIE is the best
advertised of all the world's big
bugs just now, and physically
he is about the smallest of them
all. He is so short that a man of 5 feet
7 inchesâthe average American stature
âlooks glantesque beside him. Since
ho began trying to give away his in
come he has received more than 3,000,
--000 begging letters, and his wealth dis
tributing bureau is an overworked In
stitution. Of all these communications
not more than two or three in 1000
ever reach his eye. There is one which
he treasures as his prize letter. It
!â Â» framed in bog oak and hangs in the
library of Skibo castle.
To a village In Massachusetts the i
great ironmaster presented a pipe or- j
gan, which was pronounced very fine. ,
The first recital stirred the whole coun- j
ty. Some months later Mr. Carnegie ;
was urged to contribute toward the
improvement of the waterworks sys
tem of the village, whereupon, feeling
himself imposed upon, he replied
wrathfully through his private secre- j
tary that he thought It as little as the
community could do to take care of j
itr own corporate necessities; that it j
was to the moral and physical welfare
of the people to Improve their water
works themselves, etc. The answer to
this letter by the authorities of the vil
lage contained this statement:

BE ACCURATE.
The head of one of the largest dry
goods commission houses in this city
was asked the other day how It hap
pened that his partner, upon whom
the principal responsibility of the
business rests, came to attain that po
sition while not yet 80 years of age.
"Purely and simply on his own mer
it," he replied. "He came into my
office one morning some ten or twelve
years ago and told me that he had
just finished school and was looking
for a position. I happened to have a
position open at the time for an of
fice boy and started him in at $5 a
week. His rise from that position to
the one that he now occupies was
steady and rapid and was due entirely
to the fact that, after having received
an order of Instructions, he could be
relied upon to carry them out and do
it correctly, too. He never start
ed off on anything 'half-cocked,'
so to speak. He was not afraid
to ask questions and thus get
his Instructions straight before under
taking the work in hand. In fact. I
might say that he owes everything to
the fact that he was always accurate
In all that he did. You may think
that I am preaching a sort of sermon,
but if young men entering business
positions, whether high or low, would
take for their motto the two words,
'be accurate,' and would live up to it,
there need be no fear of the ultimate
outcome of their undertakings."âNew

Whatever fortune oomes your way.
Regardless of Its merit.
It isn't always safe and right
To simply grin and bear it
For if your cherub child decides
That jam shall never fall it.
The course you must pursue la plain,
You ought to grin and whale it.
Or if your love has grown so great
You blissfully reveal It,
She says "this Is so sudden," then
You gladly grin and seal it.
If but a single seat is left
While others jolt and jog It,
Let go your strap and make a diva
You'd better grin and hog it.

THE JOHNSON IMPEACHMENT.â
Subscriber, Melburne, Mendocino
County, Cal. Andrew Johnson, Presi
dent of the United States, had come
into sharp conflict with Congress,
about the questions conected with the
reconstruction, and the breach between
the executive and the national legis
lature widened until it grew into an
Impeachmentâthe only impeachment
of a President in our history, and one
of the most. noted in the world's his
tory. On March 2, 1867, Congress
passed what Is known as the tenure of
office act. It was vetoed by the Presi
dent and passed over his veto. Edwin
M. Stanton, Secretary of War, was not
willing to lend himself to Johnson's
scheme of reconstruction. Therefore
on August 12. 1867. the President sus
pended him and appointed General
Grant ad interim. When the Senate
met the President laid his reasons for
the suspension before it, but that body
in January refused its sanction and
Stanton therefore resumed his office.
On February 21, 1868, Johnson again re
moved Stanton and appointed in his
place General Lorenzo Thomas. Stan
j ton, supported by a resolution of the
' Senate, refused to vacate his office.
; The House of. Representatives on Feb
j ruary 24 adopted a resolution for the
Impeachment of Johnson by a vote
, which stood, yeas 126, noes 47, not vot
ing 17, and on the 25th a committee
;of the House appeared before the Sen-
I ate and impeached the President. The
: articles of Impeachment, eleven in num
ber, were presented to the Senate
March 5. In brief they charged that

POULTRY RAISER'S LOT
IS NOT A HAPPY ONE
Correspondent Pours Out Tale of Woe and Suggests That
Promotion Committee Help the Industry by "Promot
ing Some of the Thieves Out of the State."
Editor The Call,
San Francisco.
Dear Sir: In the Weekly Call of De
cember 21 I see that the California
Promotion Committee is quoted aa giv
ing statistics of the great quantity of
poultry products brought Into the State
each year and deploring the fact that
they are not produced within the State,
as they very well might be.
Every once in a while the newspapers
break forth with similar statements
and wonder why every oneâexcept the
writer âdoes not roll up his sleeves and
engage in the hilariously diverting oc
cupation of raising poultry for other
folks to eat.
I should like to answer the question
by asking why the writers of these en
tertaining articles do not do It It Is
a wonder to me that they do not hold
ing as they do such ideas of its de
sirability.
I wish some of them would try It I
should Just love to live next door to
him during the progress of the experi
ment and would spend half my time
looking over the fence observing the
development of his interesting theories.
After a short time I guarantee he
would know more than he apparently
does at present even if he were not
materially richer. But there is another
answer to the question. There are too
many dogs and thieves In California.
Poultry is taxed and dogs and thieves
swarm the State and are encouraged
by being leniently dealt with. If the
Promotion Committee will address
themselves to the task of promoting
some of the thieves out of the State
they will not have to worry so much
over the poultry Industry. The law of
supply and demand will regulate it
once it is relieved of its chief enemies,
and there will be less need to establish
an expensive experiment station for
Impractical scientists to blunderingly
Investigate the question. What is the
matter with poultry in California?
It is hard enough to fight for the
lives of one's poultry with rats, cats,
dogs, skunks, coyotes, hawks, lice and
roup, with a long dry season when
there is no green grass for the foods,
with high price for grain for feed, and
high transportation rates to market,
but when in addition to all that Is hu
man thieves, the average man con
cludes the combination is against him
and looks about for an easier job.

GREAT PLANS
FOR NEW YORK
Mayor Shows That the City
Has Grown Faster Than
Provisions Made for It
MOKE WATEK NEEDED
New Schools, Bigger Police
Force and Light Necessary
to Keep Up With Expansion
NEW YORK. Jan. 2. âA funded in
debtedness for New York almost half
as great as the national debt, and a
yearly average growth and expansion
so immense that every effort to keep
abreast of It in necessary improve
ments has failed, is shown in the an
nual message of Mayor George B. Me.
Clellan, which was submitted to the
Board of Aldermen to-day. In all the
great departments the necessity for
immediate extension is shown. In
this connection the Mayor says:
Th* numerous evidences of the city's unu
ing development, which give so much satis
faction to the people, at the same time sug
gest Important plans for the future. Ex
penditures in this direction now will, I feel
sure, be regarded as a Judicious and econom
ical investment when the city of four million
shall have attained ten million Inhabitants.
The present system of water sup
ply, which has a capacity of 357,000,*
000 gallons per day in the boroughs
of Manhattan and the Bronx alone, is
inadequate, and a plan to expend im
mediately $90,000,000 in acquiring
water sheds and building aqueducts
and mains is approved.
Although twenty-two new school
buildings, among them some of the
largest in the world, were completed
and many additions to existing build
ings made during the year, affording
accommodations for more than 57.000
pupils, many thousand children are
obliged to attend part-time classes.
Contracts have been let for nineteen
new school buildings and twenty-nine
additions, which will provide 49,500
new sittings at a cost of nearly
Stj.ooo,ooo, but in view of the average
yearly increase part-time classes will
be in order next year.
Of the police force, which is now
made up of 8291 officers and men, the
Mayor says:
The police force of the city is an inferior I
I organization only in point of numbers. The I
force has not Increased proportionately with j
the population, property values and the needs !
joi the five boroughs. It is almost impossible,
j therefore, to afford the people of this city
iat all times the fullest measure of protection
)to which they are justly entitled. Any ap
j plication, therefore, for an increase In the
city's patrol force may be regarded as timely
j and most reasonable.
There is an urgent need also for an
| extension of the paid Fire Department
; system, in spite of the fact that 419
! firemen were added to the force dur
| ing the past year.
The rapid transit system planned
i but four years ago already has been
; overtaken, says the message, and the
i city has been put to new projects to
| keep pace with its expansion.
In favoring municipal ownership
and operation of an electric lighting
plant to light the streets, parks and
public buildings of New York, the
message says:
I do not believe that the Government should
engage in any service which can be done
better or as well by private enterprise or i
should invade business fields in competition
With the legitimate trade of the citizen. The
prices which the city is compelled to pay for J
gas and electric light, however, are so out j
o" proportion with the charges in other cities (
that they must be extortionate.
A statement of the city's financial
condition, which was included in the j
message, shows a gross funded debt of
$558,265,517. Against this there is a
sinkink fund of $157,380,352. leaving
a net funded debt of $400,935,165. The
; present borrowing capacity of the city
jis $68,326,725. The total national
j debt on December 1 was $1,282.

SOCIAL CIRCLES STIRRED
OVER MRS. CLARK'S COMING
Speculation as to How Young Wife of
Senator Will Be Received in
New York.
NEW YORK, Jan. 2.âThe report j
from Paris announcing that Senator
W. A. Clark and his wife are booked I
to sail for the United States next
Wednesday has caused a stir in social
circles here. How will New York so
ciety receive this new member of the
Clark family, the mistress of one of
the most expensive mansions of Fifth i
avenue ?
This will be the first appearance in
America of Mrs. Clark since the an
nouncement of her romantic marriage
to the Senator was made on July 12
last âmore than three years s.f ter the
ceremonyâto which was coupled the
tidings that a daughter had blessed
the union.
Anna E. La Chapelle, the daughter
of a French Canadian physician of
Butte, whose family Senator Clark
had found in poverty and elevated to
w-ealth, had been known as his ward.
There had been rumors of his inten
tion to marry her, but that the cere
mony had been performed was not
dreamed of by the Senator's friends.
They were married, however, at Mar
seilles on May 25. 1901.
Children Die in Flames.
DIAMONDVILLE, Wyo., Jan. 2.â.
Two children of John McPhee, one five
yc.irs old and the other a baby, were
burned to death in a fire that de
stroyed the McPhee home last night.
The parents were absent at the time,
and did not learn of their loss until
they returned.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 3, 1905.
NATION'S CHIEF
ACTS AS HOST
President Eeceives Seven
Thousand Guests at the
White House Beception
ASSISTED BY CABINET
Greets Diplomatic Corps, the
Army and Navy, and the
People of the Capital City
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2.âOfficial and
resident Washington this morning ex
tended New Year's greetings to the
President and Mrs. Roosevelt at the
White House. The eventâbrilliant and ]
attractive as the, New Year's recep- j
tions always areâmarked the formal j
opening of the social season of 1905. j
The reception was characterized by ;
true democracy. The portals of the !
White House swung wide for all the
world. All were welcomed to the his
toric mansion and afforded the oppor
tunity personally to greet both the
President and Mrs. Roosevelt. Thou- â¢
sands embraced the opportunity.
As the callers entered the White j
House they were greeted by a melody j
from the Marine Band, sixty pieces .
strong, stationed in the great vesti
bule: a blaze of color and breath of
perfume from beautiful floral decora
tions and a scene of splendor, the bril
liancy of which was enhanced by the
soft glow from myriads of shaded
electric lights. .
Preceded by his military aid. Colonel
Charles Bromwell, and his naval aid.
Commander Cameron McR. Winslow,
President Roosevelt, escorting Mrs.
Roosevelt, descended the stairs, fol
lowed by the members of the Cabinet
and their ladies, constituting the Im
mediate receiving party. The distin
guished party crossed the corridors and
entered the blue parlor, where the
President and Mrs. Roosevelt received
their guests.
I,AM! FOR THE GUESTS.
A lane was formed by old gold silk
velvet cord, through which the guests
passed from the red parlor to the green
parlor. Near the entrance to the red
room the President and Mrs. Roosevelt
stood. Directly In the door stood a
secret service officer who closely
scrutinized every person who passed in
line.
Every precaution was taken through- :
out the house to insure the safety of :
the President and others, an extra de- [
tail of police, besides several secret f
service officers, being on duty. Nobody \
was permitted to carry handkerchief j
or muffler in his hands and nobody
was permitted to pass along the line
With his hands in his pockets.
Just before 11 o'clock the members ;
of the diplomatic corps began to as- |
semble in the state dining-room. In
all, the representatives <Â»f thirty-eight
foreign countries assembled, all attired
in full dress.
CASSINI AT THE HEAD.
For the second time, as head of the |
diplomatic corps, Count Cassini, the
Embassador of Russia, was the first
diplomat to present a New j Year's
greeting to the President.
Baron Stanislaus Hengelmuller. the
Embassador of Austria-Hungary; Se
nor Don Manuel de Azpiroz the
Mexican Embassador, and Mayor den '
Planches, the Italian Embassador, with
their staffs, followed. M. Jusserand,
the Embassador of Frame, followed. '
and the greeting he received from the
President was notably cordial.
Sir Mortimer Durand. the British
Embassador, was a notable figure.
Standing several inches over six feet,
his height was accentuated by the
long coat of his uniform. Sir Morti
. mer's principal decorations were war
medals awarded him for services in the
field.
It was no new experience to Minis
ter Grip, the Minister of Sweden and
Norway, to lead the line of Ministers.
He has held the position at every New
Year's reception for many years. Mm- .
ister Kogoro Takahlra of Japan was
welcomed cordially by the President. ,
who took occasion to congratulate him
BpOB his recovery from his recent ill- {
ness.
MRS. HAY ENTERTAINS.
After the passing of the members of
the diplomatic corps, Mrs. Hay, wife
of the Secretary of State, left the re
ceiving line and accompanied the Sec
retary to their own home at Sixteenth
and Lafayette Square. There at noon
the Secretary and Mrs. Hay enter
tained the members of the diplomatic
corps at the usual diplomatic break
fast.
Chief Justice Fuller, accompanied by
the Associate Justices of the United
States Supreme Court, and the ladies
of their households, was presented to
the President and Mrs. Roosevelt im
mediately after the diplomats.
Senators. Representatives and dele
gates in Congress and the commis
sioners and Judicial officers of the Dis
trict of Columbia were next received.
Following the legislative came the
military branch of the Government. It
consisted of officers of the United
States Army and Marine Corps on
duty in Washington, and the general
and staff of the militia of the District
of Columbia. All officers were in full
uniform, and Lieutenant General Adna
R. Chaffee, chief of staff, was at their
head.
LARGER THAN LAST YEAR.
Next came the naval officers, attired
In their full dress, with the admiral
of the navy, George Dewey, at their
head.
Beginning at 12:15 o'clock the recep
tion to representatives of civilian gov
ernments began. At 12:30 p. m. mem
bers of various civilian and seml-mlll
tary organizations were received.
About 1 o'clock the general reception
to citizens began.
The reception was concluded at 2:27
o'clock. The total number of callers
was 7718, nearly a thousand more than
last year.
LATTER DAY SAINTS
REJOICE OVER WORK
Jubilee Celebration Held in New York
to' Review the Year's
Achievements.
NEW YORK, Jan. 2.âlf the Senate
Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions had been in Harlem yesterday
Its members could have gathered some
Information pertinent to the case of
Senator Smoot without giving the el
ders the "th'rd degree." There was a
Jubilee gathering of Latter Day Saints
In the Hawthorne building, at which
all sorts of revelations were made.
Besides being a regular Mormon
feast day the gathering was in the
nature of a celebration of the mis
sionary work accomplished here in
New York in the last year. The half
dozen elders in charge of the Jubilee
performance had not the least hesita
tion in bragging about their work in
their speeches of felicitation.
It never seems half so bad to lose ten
dollars on a horse race as to lose ten
cents by dropping it down a lottery
slot.

BIG HANDICAP WON BY CLAUDE
MARKING THE FIRST DAY'S RACING OF THE YEAR AT OAKLAND
RESULTS IN A SENSATIONAL STRUGGLE, WHICH IS FINALLY
DARUMA, WITH BULLMAN UP,
WINS TWO-YEAR-OLD EVENT
Daughter of sofitaire Never headed
Claude Carries His Weighty Impost
and Defeats Bombardier.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
By shouldering 132 pounds and win
ning the New Year handicap, at a mile
and an eighth. Claude threw 10,000 rac
ing enthusiasts into a state of frenzied
enthusiasm yesterday at Oakland. The
bay son of Lissak will long be remem
bered as one 6t the greatest horses that
ever faced the starter in California. He
handled his weighty impost with the
ease that Sandow would juggle a feath
er mattress, and it is just probable that
he could have carried in addition flat
cars loaded with gravel enough to fill
in the lately discovered crack in the
moon and then have won.
The holiday gathering was an im
mense one, though possibly not up to
the Christmas throng. Still there was
no room for a lounger anywhere, and a
pilot's license alone made navigation
through the betting ring a certainty.
Latest creations of the milliner's and
dressmaker's art contributed to making
the grand stand a dream of fairyland,
while wealth and fashion crowded and
elbowed each other on the clubhouse
lawn and verandas. The weather was a
reminder of a day spent in the Bermu
das, and the Easterners were perforce
compelled to acknowledge our climate
supreme.
FOUR OUTSIDERS LAND.
Then, again, there was variety and
spice enough about the sport to make
it interesting. Two successful favorites
and four outsiders to furnish the sur
prises left nothing to be desired. Con
ceding Claude the laurels of the big
event, worth $2210 to the winner, Daru
ma, the Napa Stock Farm representa
tive, carried off the honors by taking
the first two-year-old event of the sea
son.
A heavy track reduced the number
of starters in the handicap to a field
of five. To oppose Claude were the Jen
nings pair, Gold Money and Rockaway,
Bombardier and Modicum. It was not
an imposing alignment, and Mike
Daly's crack went into the starter's
hands a 13 to 20 favorite. Willie Daly
rode Claude, and previous to the race
Pa Daly, with a chart of the good and
bad spots of the course, gave his son
instructions enough to carry him
around the world in seventy-eight days.
Unfortunately for Willie, he could not
put them to practical use.
MODICUM AS PACEMAKER.
Jake Holtman gave the bunch a good
. send-off, but Daly was beaten to the
clubhouse turn by Modicum, so Willies
plans were knocked in the head at.the
commencement, for this placed him in
â the deep going on the rail. When Mod
icum faltered W. Davis astride Bom
bardier took his place, and on the far
turn it looked a ferry-boat to a custard
pie that Bombardier would capture the
plum. But prospective success ruined
Davis. Striking the stretch first, he
forced Daly on the favorite to keep in
on the rail. Then, a furlong from home,
when Claude began drawing up on his
mount, he could not resist departing
from the good path, but jammed Daly
in the heavy going, where he could
possibly do a bit of jockeying. This
equalized matters, and Claude, respond
ing to every call, outstayed and out
gamed the lightweight, winning by a
neck. Eight lengths back. Gold Money
ran third. The winner was the recipient
of a tremendous ovation, the equal of
which has seldom been witnessed on a
California track.
Next in importance came the kinder
garten event at three furlongs for 2
year-olds. Eleven baby racers sport
ed silk. D. Cameron's Sir Wilfred had
thÂ« call at 12 to 5. Tips were numer
ous, especially on Daruma, Sis Hop
kins and Chief Wittman.
DARUMA ATTRACTS ATTENTION.
Daruma, the first of the get of the
English horse, Solitaire, to face the
barrier, attracted more than passing
attention, for Bullman had the leg up.
Alert as ever, Bullman got the shapely
filly away in front and she simply tow
roped her field, winning from Sir Wil
: fred by four open lengths in :36%.
Chief Wittman finished a fair third.
Bonner took the first race of the
new year with Alta G., a 10 to 1 shot,
played down to 4%. The mare got
away well and. opening up a gap of
â¢ daylight over her field, won easily by
five open lengths. Emma Reubold, the
favorite, finished second, three lengths
before Inspector Munro. J. H. Ben
nett, backed at "long odds, failed to
make good.
Enough money was bet on Judge to
sink a ferry boat. Rector, a long shot,
beat him without effort for the six
furlong purse event, third to be de
cided. The price about Rector dropped
from 15 down to 8, and with Travers in
the saddle, the gelding made a run
away race of it. Michaels, who piloted
the first choice, Judge, did succeed in
leading out Ishlana for place honors.
Bullman rode his second winner of
the afternoon when he placed Sol Lich
tenstein over the home plate first for
the seven furlong selling number. Sol
closed a 4 to 5 chance, and in a busy
finish beat Dora I, the pacemaker, a
neck, with nothing to give away. Re
volt, the runner up for most of the
journey, ran into the show. The Lieu
tenant performed to no advantage.
LADY GOODRICH SCORES.
The after piece entitled "How to Fool
the- Native Sons," made an instantan
eous hit, and will later be taken to
dear old Broadway for Knickerbocker
approval. In it Lady Goodrich took
the part of the underestimated heroine
and ably supported by Charley Bell,
enlisted the sympathy of the smart
bettors from the raise of the curtain.
Her Ladyship played to a poor house
one week ago, but with added brass
in the orchestra and brand new scenic
effects, it looks as if she might still
occupy a proscenium box in the stellar
firmament. Charley Bell was seen at
his best. There was an absence of
ranting and fooling with the discard
and her opening quotation pared from
10 down to 4, Lady Goodrich strutted
in an imposing winner over Downpat
rick and Ara. A. Muskoday and Hooli
gan, first and second choices respec
tively, made as good a showing as
Parker did in the recent election.
TRACK NOTES.
Four field books accommodated bet
tors besides the twenty-five books in
the ring.
Arthur Redfern, the crack Eastern
rider, viewed the racing from the
ground. Arthur leaves for Hot Springs
shortly, where he will ride for Tommy

Olympic Club Handball.
Two fast games were played in the
handball tournament at the Olympic
Club yesterday. Fred Baine defeated
Hugo Poheim in two straight games.
Scores, 21-10, 21-10. Baine proved
himself a great player. Poheim did
splendidly, but was no match for the
coming champion. George James suc
cumbed to H. Began after two excit
ing games. Scores 21-19, 21-8. In
the first game James played brilliant
ly. The tournament has shown that
men who play the old Irish game with
a hard ball have no license to play
with a soft ball. Al Hampton will
play Baine for the club champion
ship next Friday night. Bogan and
Baine will play on Wednesday night.

ternoon.
pearance after a severe attack of ty
phoid fever.
Once more has Harry Stover lost
Hulford. The gelding was claimed out
of the first race by A. Yehl, owner of
Florinel.
Bullman was the only rider to pilot
two winners. John appears to be re
gaining his form, for his handling of
Daruma could not have been improved
upon.
Solitarie, sire of Daruma, was pur
chased in England, together with
Marius 11, for A. B. Spreckels, master
of Napa Stock Farm, by Enoch Wish
ard. Sons of this noted horse,, bred at
the Napa establishment, brought fabu
lous prices in New York last summer
and now a daughter brings him into
prominence by leading out a smart
field in the first kindergarten event of
the season. Trainer Bill Carroll is en
titled to much credit for the splendid
showing made by the young Miss.

EXCITING FINISH OF THE QUARTER-MILE PONY RACE AT SAN MATEO AND THE WINNER.
GOOD RACING
AT SAN MATEO
Brilliant sport marked the racing on
the private course of Charles W. Clark
at San Mateo yesterday, under the aus
pices of the California Polo and Pony
Racing Association. The stands were
well filled, while there was a brave
showing of automobiles, four-in-hands
and smart traps lined up along the in
field fence. All were filled with people
well known in the fashionable world.
Rudolph Spreckels carried off the
lion's share of the honors, his ponies
finishing first in three of the five races.
Through bad racing luck his beautiful
mare Becky did not have a chance to
show her speed in the quarter-mile race,
in which she was defeated in compara
tively slow time by W. S. Hobarfs Sil
ver Dick.
Charley Dunphy, who is as alert at
the post as John Bullman, had the leg
up on Silver Dick. There were several
false breaks at the post, in all of which
Dunphy was away flying. When a
start was finally effected Dunphy was
out in front with the Hobart pony.
Becky was off absolutely last and was
tangled up with another pony. Frank
Skinner had to take her wide at the
turn. She finished at a tremendous
pace, cutting down Silver Dick's lead to
one and a half lengths at the wire.
Hobart had two strings to his bow, as
he also started Marigold, which he
scratched out of another race. Silver
Dick had all the racing luck and
Charley Dunphy hustled him along the
entire journey, never giving him a
chance to loiter.
The interest in the Champion stakes,
at six furlongs, run for the first time
at this meeting, was lessened when
it was found Fusillade would be an
absentee. This left Rudolph Spreckels
and C. W. Clark each represented by
two entries. Charley Dunphy sported
the copper colors of Mr. Clark on Bas
Blancs, a sweet bay pony. He got her
off in front and soon opened up a gap
of three lengths on his field. They
were never able to reduce this lead, Bas
Blancs winning cleverly from Honoma.
The last race furnished the greatest
surprise of the day, Charley Dunphy
rode Carlotta, the crack Southern
California mare which was made a
strong favorite. She assumed the lead
at the start but was displaced by
Brown Peggy after a furlong had been
covered. The latter led into the
stretch, where she was passed by Car
lotta and a shout went up, "Carlotta
wins!"
A moment after R. J. Dunphy
brought Mr. Spreckels' Cheerful up
with a rush and the two brothers
hooked up in a desperate finish. R. J.
Dunphy finally landed Cheerful a
winner by the shortest of necks, Car
lotta being second.
The cerise, green fleur de lis of Ru
dolph Spreckels were carried to vic
tory in the first race, at three-six
teenths of a mile, by his pony Don,
ridden by Frank Skinner. Charley
Dunphy shot into the lead at the start
with C. W. Clark's Silver Queen and
held the advantage well into the
stretch. Once Don was straightened
out for home he outfooted his field and
won easily by an open length.
R. J. Dunphy followed in the foot
steps of his illustrious brother, Charley,
landing Mr. Spreckels' bay mare Hope
ful an easy first in the race at three
eighths of a mile. He opened up a gap
at the start which the others could not
overcome, winning ultimately by two
lengths. In a whipping finish C. W.
Clark's Chanate beat Rudolph Spreck
els' Lady Gay for the place.
Frank Skinner finished first once and
second twice. Charley Dunphy rode
two winners and two place horses. R.
J. Dunphy, who made his debut as a
gentleman jockey, rode two winners in
clever style.
There will be racing again next Sat
urday when larger fields will prevail.

AEOLUS IS VICTORIOUS
IN THE HOLIDAY STAKES
Aeolus showed a flash of his old
time form yesterday by showing his
heels to a fleet field of greyhounds at
Union Coursing Park. Aeolus won his
trials strictly on merit, leading and
outworking his opponents. Ina Cis
sus was beaten easily in the deciding
course by a score of 10 to 1. Charter
Member was made the stake favorite,
but his chances were ruined by hav
ing an undecided course in the fourth
round with Daisy Rocket. He was
beaten in the next round.
The betting during the day was
brisk and the talent fared badly, as
there were thirteen winning outsiders.
The defeat of Texas Jill at 5 to 1 and
also the defeat of Rocked Asleep by
Texas Mamie at like odds were rude

GOLFER ABBOTT
IN RARE FORM
S. LÂ«. Abbott Jr. was In gTeat form
yesterday on the course of the San
Francisco Golf and Country Club. He
won the Liverpool gold medal, which
is emblematic of the golf champion
ship of the club at medal play, with
a score of 38, 42, total 80, for eighteen
holes. He also won the prize for the
best gross score in the thirty-six hole
handicap, with 38, 42, 46, 48, total
174. As he received a handicap of 12
strokes his net score for the thirty
six holes was 162, the lowest net score
made during the day.
The prize for best net score went,
however, to Dr. F. \V. Clampett, with
168, as it is not the practice to award
the prizes for best gross and best net
scores to the same competitor. B. D.
Adamson, though he has been absent
from the links for more than a year,
returned the excellent gross score for
the thirty-six holes of 175, his after
noon rounds of 43, 42 being the best
made after luncheon. The name of
S. L. Abbott Jr. will be engraved on
the Shreve shield, .which is a conspic
uous ornament of the clubhouse man
telpiece. The course was in good con
dition and the weather favorable to
golf. The full details are shown in

Great Area Is Rich in Possibilities That Are Alluring
GLENN County this morning is given opportunity to draw the attention of the world, through the columns of The Call,
to its vast and fertile domain. on%'hich many thousands of persons could easily he accommodated and all find homes
and prosperity within their reach. The wheat ranches have been superseded by small farms. Towns and cities have
sprung up where formerly the land was devoted to one crop and lauds have been made to blossom as the rose by the intelligent
application of labor and irrigation. The list of the rich products of the county submitted is sufficient to attract attention even
in opulent California.
GREAT CENTRAL CANAL, FORTY MILES LONG AND WITH A BIG FLOW, WHICH SUPPLIES IRRIGATION FOB TWO COUNTIES,
Isidore J. Proulx has written for The
Call an account of Glenn County,
which he describes as "the gem of the
Sacramento Valley." Its southern line
is 110 miles north of San Francisco and
sixty miles north of Sacramento. It
contains 850,000 acres. Between the
â¢ Sacramento River and the first low
hills on the west are more than 300,000
acres of level land. Just west of this
is a belt of low, rolling hills, in which
73,000 acres are in cultivation. The
. steeper hills cover about 150.000 acres
. that are principally used for grazing.
The hills protect many rich vaileys
which yield abundantly. In the narrow
â¢ valley of Stony Creek are 50.000 Acres
of farming land, with about an equal
u mount of grazing land between the
' valley and the mountains proper.
Mr. Proulx writes:
â¢ 'The higher mountains are by no
means a wilderness, but abound in cozy
homes of hardy mountaineers and
; ] leasant summer residences of dwellers
of the plain, drawn hither in pursuit of
deer and trout
Stony Creek rises in Colusa County.
. twenfy-miles south of the county line,
. .and Mows north through a narrow val
intil it has traversed two-thirds of
Â° <Jlenn County. Here it receives the
water of Grindstone Creek, which car
. lies about an equal volume, and to
gether they begin to force their way
. Ihrouph the ranges of hills that parallel
the mountains. From here the course
â¢ is northeast till it passes the last of
; these barriers at a point in Tehama
â¢County, one mile north of the county
line, and fourteen mile* west of the
It then turns anj flows south
easterly till it reaches the Sacramento
River nine miles south of the north
. boundary line of Glenn County, and
'â¢ due east from the point where it breaks
through the first range of hills.
COUNTY'S GARDEN SPOTS.
"Willows, the garden spot, county
seat and principal town of Glenn Coun
ty, is located on the railroad a little
. buuth of the center of the county. The
. < ounty buildings, consisting of a splen
did,'modern courthouse and a jail and
â¢ hospital, are located here. It has a
â¢ JiO.ooo grammar school building and a
. tine high school building, which was
completed last year.
'The town is lighted by electricity.
. and has splendid water works, which
furnish pure, good water for domestic
and fire purposes. It has two well
equipped hose companies.
"A creamery, centrally located and
fitted up in the most modern style and
.with up-to-date machinery, is one of
â¢ the industries.
"The streets are perfectly graded,
graveled and oiled and lined on either
side with shade trees The sidewalks
in the residence portion of the town
â¢are all graveled with nice fine gravel
â  and in the business portion of the town
â¢they are paved with concrete. Visitors
"to Willows notice the fine orange and
lemons that are grown in the town.
â¢ "The lovers of civic or secret socie
' ties find flourishing lodges of Masons,
\ Odd Fellows. Woodmen of the World,'
Workmen, Eastern Stars and Re

, churches and five organizationsâCath
â¢ olic, Baptist, M. E. Church South,
.Episcopalian and Christianâall having
gr od congregations and regular serv
ices.
- "Willows Is governed wisely and
economically, the-e being no town debt.
â¢'The population of the Incorporated
.. town and its additions is 2000, and Is
rapidly increasing; the breaking up of
the large ranches near has infused new

The wagon roads are unsurpassed'
and are never muddy In winter and
â¢ seldom dusty In summer. They are a
â valuable asset to the farmer, since they
permit him to move his produce to
railroad or river at a moderate ex
pense. All streams and water ways are
crossed by substantial bridges. Good
horses, bicycles and automobiles are'
I very much In evidence. Traveling over
j such roads is a rare pleasure.
"Orland. in size the second town in
â¢ the county, is on tho railroad, seven
! teen miles north of Willows. It has a
j fine graded school and a high school,
j There are several orange groves in Or
| land and a fine orange and lemon nurs
i cry. A small irrigation canal in that
; section of the county passes through
! the town. Orland is growing very rap
, idly. ,
"The other railroad towns are Ger
mantown, near the center of the coun
j ty, and Norman, near the south boun
; dary, and Fruto, seventeen miles west
|of Willows and the terminus of the
, branch railroad running from Willows.
' Elk Creek <uid Newville are thriving
: villages in the valley at the base of
I tho mountains on the west. Butte City
| is located on the rich lands on the east
side of the river. Jacinto, which was
an important business center many
years ago, is situated on the west bank
of the river, about midway of the
Glenn ranch. It has long been omit
ted from the list of towns, but will now
have to be reinstated, as the sale of
this land has created a demand for the
town, which has been surveyed and
platted.
SCHOOLS ARE ABUNDANT.
'"California has always made liberal
provision for schools, and those of
Glenn County are up to the high stand
ard of the State. There are thirty
seven districts, employing forty-seven
teachers, besides the two high schools,
one of which is at Willows, the other
at Orland. Two new districts have re
cently been formed on the Glenn ranch,
made necessary by the settlement of
these lands, and it is a matter of but
a short time before others will be or
ganized.
"The rights of children are well pro
tected. As soon as fifteen of school age
arc- brought together in a new locality
a school is equipped for their instruc
tion.
"There are more than a dozen fine
church buildings in the countyâfour
at Willows, three at Orland, two at
Butte City, while Germantown, Elk
Creek, Newville and Afton have houses
[ of worship.
"The population of Glenn County in
1900 was 5150. In wealth per capita
it is the richest county in the State,
and with the recognized standing of
California in this regard, this is equiv
alent to saying that here the oppor
tunities for brain or brawn are greater
than in any other part of the world.
"There is not a foot of desert land,
nor an acre of submerged land in the
county, if we except the beds of the
running streams. Every part is fer
tile and productive. From the garden
lands along the river and other
streams, through the grain fields and
stock pastures, up the hillsides,
through the goat ranges, to the forest
of the valuable timber on the high
mountains, every acre is contributing
something to the wealth and comfort
of the inhabitants.
"Stony Creek is the last stream on
the west side of the valley that emp
ties directly in the river. Those
north of it have not sufficient volume
to build up the valley as fast as the
river does, consequently the river is
flowing on a slight elevation, or ridge,
the land sloping gently down to the
west for a few miles to the bottom of
the 'trough,' and from there grad
ually rising to the base of the west
ern hills. This 'trough,' as It is called,
has its beginning about half way be
tween the north and south boundaries
of Glenn County and deepens as it ex
tends down the valley, until in the
counties below It becomes a basin, re
taining its waters till late in the sea
son.
GREAT FERTILE AREAS.
"Before the days of the levees, the
overflow from the river at flood time
used to rush back to this 'trough' and Â«
on to the south, adding fertility to the j
soil and building up the land by de- !
positing its sediment. Consequently
the land between the river and the
bottom of this depression is known as
river land and is the richest to be
found. All the 40,000 acres east of
the river and over 80,000 acres on the
west side are of this character. The
country between this depression and
the hills is known as nlains land, and
is also very fertile.
"It varies In character from * the
gravel of a narrow strip near the mid
dle of the plain, to the richest black â¢
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 3, 1905.
adobe. 50,000 acres of which are ly
ing west and south of Willows. There
is also a large area of black adobe
of slightly different character, in that
it contains a large percentage of or
ganic matter, northeast of Willows
along the west side of the Glenn
ranch. Near the north side of this
ranch and extending back to the mid
dle of the plain is a large body of
a reddish clayey soil that is recognized
as being the best wheat land in ex
istence.
â¢'Just north of Willows, Willow
Creek has built up a broad belt of al
luvial soil closely allied to that along
the river, and has carried it across
the plains from the hills to the river
land. Just north of this, near the
center of the plains, is a great bed
cf whitish clay soil which produces
abundant crops of cereals.
"Those six soilsâthe two adobes, the
two clays and the two loamsâare for
grain-growing of almost equal value
and are held at about the same prices.
Besides these there are smaller bodies
of different grades, such as gray grav
el, red gravel, white silt, etc., each be
ing the soil par excellence for some
particular crops, as alfalfa, citrus
fruits, grapes, etc. Back among the
hills are many small valleys contain
ing several hundred acres with soil
similar to the best along the western
rim of the plain.
"Just south of Willows, along the
bottom of the depression referred to as
the trough, is a narrow strip of very
fiat land of poorer quality, which can
be classed only as grazing land. There
are only about 16,000 acres of this in
Glenn County, but as the railroad runs
along it and through it visitors fre
quently get the impression that south
of Willows good land is rather scarce.
The truth is that on either side of this
is to be found the richest land in the
valley.
' The latitude of Willows is 39 degrees
30 minutes north, which is practically
the same as Baltimore and Cincinnati.
This fact makes it hard for people
from the Eastern to understand
why there Is a mild, semi-tropical cli
mate in the Sacramento Valley. To one
familiar with the elements of physical
geography a little reflection explains
the matter. The western side of each
continent is warmer than the corre
sponding latitude on the eastern side,
and when a comparison is sought the*
Pacific Coast of America should be
compared, not with our Atlantic States,
but with the western coast of Europe.
Glenn County is three degrees farther
south than the extreme southern point
of France, and most of Spain and all of
Italy lie farther north than Willows.
The records of the Government observ
ers show the climate of Glenn County
to be very similar to that of Sicily, the
island so famous for its lemon groves.
U'Xl RIAXT VEGETATION.
"To visitors the climate is vouched
for by stately palms, by bearing olives,
oranges, lemons and even limes; by
mammoth fig trees producing tons of
fruit each season; by the luxuriant
growth in the open air of thousands of
semi-tropical shrubs and vines, and by
ever blooming flowers. Roses bloom in
December and Januaryâthough not in
such profusion as in May and June,
when every bush is a large bouquet.
"Glenn County is well watered and its
opportunities for irrigation are ideal.
Butte Creek, already referred to as the
southeastern boundary, is a living
Stream, carrying a large volume of wa
ter from the Sierras. The Sacramento
River.which at all seasons carries suf
ficient water to irrigate the whole val
ley, is tapped near the north line of the
county by the Great Central canal.
This great canal was begun about fif
teen years ago by the Central Irriga
tion District, which comprised 52,000
acres in Glenn County and over 80,000
in Colusa County, all being plains land
lying west of the trough.
"Owing to some defect in the organ
ization and a consequent legal tangle,
the ditch was not completed. Two
years ago it came into possession of
the Central and Irrigation Company,
which is now about ready to deliver
water to these lands. Not content,
howevtr, with furnishing water for this
vast area, the company has already a
big ditch down the river which will
serve 60,000 acres in Glenn County, in
cluding the famous Glenn and Packer
ranches, and much more in Colusa
County, Including the great ranch of
Senator Boggs.
â 
' This la all land of the richest qual
ity, lying east of the trough and out
si.lt- of the limit of the old irrigation
district.
"Water has been already turned into
this big ditch and lateral ditches are
now being made to those who are hold
ing water rights and are wanting wa
ter for next season's irrigation.
WATKR IS SUFFICIENT.
Â»'To him who does not find a canal
ready to deliver water to his land or
who wishes to be complete master of
the source of his supply, the water be
neath the soil is an easy solution of the
problem of irrigation. There are sev
eral well-defined strata of water bear
ing gravel beneath every bit of the
valley lands.
. "Irrigation in Glenn County is no
experiment, as water has been success
fully applied to the soil in the northern
part of the county for many years.
As an illustration it may be well to
mention a little Glenn County irrigated
farm of but one acre, which has re
cently become as famous as the Glenn
ranch with its many thousand acres.
This is the farm of the late S. G.
Cleek. On the one acre Mr. Cleek
comfortably supported himself and
wife, and beside contributing to church
work in which he was interested was
able to save something like $400 a
year."
All fruits grow to perfection in Glenn
County. Irrigation is not necessary, as
the average rainfall is 17 to 18 inches
in the valley portion and more in the
hills. The county is a la*hd of bound
less opportunities for live people. Mr.
Proulx adds the following statements:
Pâchâ. pears and prunes yield from |200
to <3no per acre, and begin bearing the third
and fourth year. No other fresh fruit Is so
easily handled as Bartlett pears, nor any
other bo easily dried as prunes. All the
finest canned peaches In the world * market
come from the Sacramento Valley.
Here one can have a home of his own,
with his cows and pigs and chickens fur
nUhin.; him with fresh milk, butter, meat
and eg:*, and In his own bark yard in
proper season can gather apples, apricots
almonds, cherries, fig?, plums, prunes, pome
granates, grapefruit, grapes, lemons, limes,
louuats. oranges, olives, peaches, pears, per
simmons, qulnoes, walnuts, blackberries and
strawberries. He can from his own garden
iet the best and tenderest of vegetables, and
be always at home with or near to his wife
and children. Is It a wonder that in such a
land the great wheat kings are finding It dif
ficult to get,,men enough to plow and sow and
reap for them?
VARIED CELEBRATION
OPENS THE NEW YEAR
Rweptlon, Gymnasium Work and
Dramatic Entertainment by Young
Men's Christian Association.
The advent of the new year was fit
tingly celebrated by the members of
the Young Men's Christian Association
yesterday. There was a good pro
gramme, and the festivities continued
several hours. Many friends of the
association were present to exchange
New Year's greetings and those hav
ing charge of the affair arranged
every detail for their thorough enjoy
ment.
Early in the afternoon an informal
reception was given in the parlors of
the association by the Woman's Aux
iliary. A corps of young ladies as-,
srsted in serving refreshments and en
tertaining the guests. Later exercises
were conducted in the gymnasium un
der the direction of Howard M.
Strickler and Mr. Adler, physical di
rectors. A wrestling match, some hor
izontal and parallel-bar work, a bas*
ket-ball game and a tug-of-war added
to the amusement. In the evening a
comedy, "The Rich Miss Poor," in one
act, and the comedy, "Mr. Bob," in
two acts, were acted in the auditorium
by pupils from the Paul Gerson
School of Acting. A large audience
was present.
Unconscious From Gas.
Tony Sevely, a cook, was found in
his room at 541 Sixth street yester
day afternoon unconscious, A gas jet
was open. He was removed to the
Emergency Hospital, where Dr. O. S.
Kucich administered restoratives. His
chances for recovery are good. Sevely
is a recent arrival in this country, and
probably did not understand the dan

WEIGHS FAULTS
OF THE CRITICS
Rev. Boardman Says They
Fail to Place Themselves
in a Spiritual Condition
REVIVAL IN EVANGELISM
Ministers Learn of Work
to Be Done in California
During the Ensuing Year
"Mad rush for the accumulation of
' money has resulted in a disregard for
spiritual matters," said the Rev. H. I*
j Boardman at a meeting of the Baptist
| Ministers' Association yesterday. He
was discussing "The Moral Requisite
| for the Discernment of Spiritual
Truth," and he felt that men in these
: times measure things by material
standards, with the result that spirit
ual truth is not attainable in the whirl
of speculative interest.
He considered that apprehension of
truth is as conditional as any other
knowledge that is obtained, and said
that purely intellectual opinions may
chill the heart and are the basis of
average skepticism, and that spiritual
truth, is the essence of unselfishness.
The speaker said that in the pulpit
there is a temptation to compromise
the truth in order to meet more readily
the people. At the same time he con
sidered that while the minister was
right to use! art to make converts and
to, do the best possible, even to make
use of the "sensational," he must never
"compromise the truth."
The fault with critics, he held, was
that they failed to place themselves in
"a spiritual condition," and he declared
that no man can set that condition
aside and successfully criticize the
Scriptures.
Rev. Robert Whitaker, pastor of the
Twenty-third-avenue Baptist Church,
Oakland, told the meeting that his con
gregation contributed $1500 on New
Year's day toward lifting the debt. The
handsome offering now left them with
only $3000 to pay, which amount Mr.
Whitaker felt would be forthcoming
during the year.
It was announced that the Rev. H.
A. Slaughter of Los Angeles had been
appointed city evangelist by the Bap
tist City Missionary Society. The Rev.
Madison Slaughter will enter the evan
gelistic field In California. His home
will be at Fruitvale.
Dr. C. M. Hill, president of the re
cently established Baptist Seminary,
said that a building had been pur
chased on Dwight Way, Berkeley, for
the seminary headquarters at a cost of
$6550, a sum considered to be very mod
erate. Next Sunday will be "Seminary
Sunday," when the interests of the new
institution will be presented to the
whole of the Baptist congregations.
Wilbur Chapman, evangelist, is ex
pected to arrive in San Francisco the
beginning of March, when no less than
thirty churches will combine in a strong
evangelical movement.
At the West Side Christian Church,
Bush street, near Devisadero, to-mor
row evening there will be a meeting of
much importance to the body, when the
roll call of the churches will be called
and reports of the year will â¢be read
from all the organizations connected
with the Christian church. It is possi
ble that some interesting news as to
the progress of the forthcoming con
vention will be told the assembled rep
resentatives of the church.
Jostled Against a Woman.
Frank Smith of 223 Dore street, and
two companions, while wending their
way along Ninth street, between Fol
som and Harrison, at an early hour
yesterday morning, jostled against a
woman who was with a man. The
jostle was considered by the man and
the woman as an insult, -as it was re
sented by a blow on the side of the
head, which knocked Smith down.
While lying on the sidewalk he re
ceived a kick on the side of his face
that broke his jawbone. He was
I treated at the Emergency Hospital by
S Dr. O. S. Kucich. He has no idea who
I kicked him.

NOTED MURDER
CASE ON TRIAL
Charles Tucker Before Court
in Massachusetts, Accused
of Taking Woman's Life
CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 2.âCharles
L. Tucker of Auburndale, appeared In
the Middlesex County Court to-day to
answer to the charge of murdering
Miss Mabel Page at Weston. Mass., on
March 31. 1904.
The jury was completed without
great difficulty, and the indictment
was read. Counsel for the defense sug
gested the wisdom of the jury visit
ins: the scene of the crime. On this
point the defendant himself said to the
court:
"Your Honor and gentlemen of the
jury 1 should like to have the jury take
a view of the premises, but I should
not like to be present."
The evidence against the defendant
has been carefully concealed by the
State representatives. It is known,
however, that-one of the most impor
tant features will be a penciled note
bearing the name of Miss Page, and
written, it is claimed, to furnish the
writer with a pretext for gaining en
trance to the Page home. The State
will present four handwriting experts
to connect Tucker with the note. The
defense also will present four experts
for its side.
Few murders anywhere have attract
ed wider attention. Miss Page, who
was 40 years of age, was killed while
alone at home. Her father, Edward
Page, a former steel merchant, re
turning from Boston early in the after
noon, found the body lying in her
chamber. Cuts in the throat were
taken to indicate suicide and the medi
cal examination so resulted, but the
next day an undertaker discovered
that Miss Page had been stabbed in
the back and the fact murder had been
done was established.
For weeks the whole police machin
ery of the State and of the cities near
Weston was at work on the mystery.
At length Charles L. Tucker was ar
rested on suspicion, but after arv ex
amination was released, an alibi ap
parently having been established. A
week later, however, he was again ar
rested and subsequently was indicted
for the murder.
STATE RIVERS
CLAIM NOTICE
Xcedham Takes Up Question
of Improvement With the
Congressional Committee
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
CALL. BUREAU, POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Jan. 2.âRepresenta
tive Needham to-day had an interview
with Chairman Burton of the Rivers
and Harbors Committee concerning
the Sacramento River and an appro
priation for its improvement Burton
first of all expressed a desire to see
the report of the State commission and.
the recommendations it makes. The
committee has taken no action In this
matter nor is it likely to until this
report is laid before it.
While Congress is in no way bound
by the action or recommendation of a
State commission, the Rivers and
Harbors Committee wants the fullest
and best information obtainable upon
matters within its jurisdiction and pre
sumes that such is contained in this
report. Needham, at Burton's re
quest, has wired Governor Pardee to
forward a copy of the report at all
speed.
Needham will introduce a joint reso
lution providing that the work of the
State commission be reviewed by the
War Department. This is with the
hope of its possible acceptance by that
department, thus effecting a saving of
time and expense in coming to some
agreement between the National and
State governments for sharing the cost
and labor for a comprehensive and
satisfactory improvement of the river
and its tributaries.

IN SPITE OF BIG STORMS THE LINER SIERRA
REACHES THIS PORT AHEAD OF SCHEDULE TIME.
Steamer Anchors in .Quarantine Before Sunrise Yesterday
French Cruiser Protet
Is on Her Way to
This City.
The Oceanic Steamship company's
j liner Sierra, Captain Houdlette, began
the New Year well by getting into port
yesterday from Australia in the dark
early morning and landing her pas
sengers at Pacific street wharf before
the city had fairly opened its eyes. The
Sierra arrived off the bar at 4:30 a. m.
and after taking the pilot on board
headed for quarantine, where she was
all ready for the doctor at sunrise.
The Sierra left Sydney December 12,
and between there and Auckland en
countered heavy southerly gales. There
was more heavy weather between New
Zealand and Pago Pago and after leav
ing Honolulu the Sierra first encoun
tered westerly gales and then a good
stiff blow from the south. In spite of
strong winds and high seas, however,
she held faithfully to her schedule and
reached this port several hours before
she was expected. She was five days
and ten hours coming up from Hono
lulu.
The Sierra's passengers included the
following:

Bell, Master W. Bell Charles J. Carey,

Fishermen in Trouble.
If Uncle Sam will Inform the Greek flsher
men who ply their trade on the waters of this
harbor Just how much of the water surround
ing Angel Island Is sacred to the Government
the sons of Greece will arrange their cruising
accordingly. Loudly and with bitterness the
fishermen are complaining of the treatment ac
corded them of late by the military authorities
stationed on Angel Island, and they are un
able to get either explanation or redress. A
few days ago a fishing boat passing the island
was hailed by a military guard. The fisher
men ran their boat to the beach. Soldiers
seized them and. taking nets, oars and a jug
of wine from the boat, took prisoners and prop
erty inland. A sergeant compelled the sol
diers to give up the wine Jug, but the men of
Mars retained the nets. The fishermen were re
leased and now are unable to fish for lack of
nets, and so far have not been able either to
recover their property or to find out why it
was taken from them. Five fishermen were
seized a day or so later and are said to be
still detained on the island. At army head
quarters at the Phelan building the fishermen
were told they must tell their troubles to the
commanding officer on Angel Island. When 1
the* tried to visit that dignitary they were |
ordered away by a sentry, who threatened to
shoot if they stood on the order of their going.
The, fishermen have always respected the order
to give Alcatraz a wide berth but in the past,
they say, their right to fish tinder the shadow
of Angel Island, except at the quarantine sta
tlon, has never been questioned. They have
tried to adjust the new difficulty themselves
and have failed. They have decided to enlist
the services of a lawyer and hope with his
assistance to persuade the commander of the
Angel Island force to give their grievance a
hearing. Meanwhile they are giving Angel lsl.
and a wide berth.

Lakme Starts South.
The steam achooner Lakme, which lost rud
! der and tall shaft when she bumped the Hum

to 100 battles, iiio proportion steadily decreased until during the French revolution the proportion was
25 to 100. wliile during the First Empir e only 16 sieges occurred to 100 battles.
Tokio Government Will Endeavor to Induce President
Roosevelt to Act as Intermediary.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 3, 2 a. m.â
While there is no longer any doubt in
official circles in St. Petersburg that
the fate of Port Arthur has been de
cided and General Stoessel's long and
Kaliaut defense ended, news of the sur
render has not yet been allowed to
reach the public. Foreign telegrams
have been withheld from the news
papers, pending the issue of the offi
cial announcement here. The Govern
ment is fol'owing the dictates of its
own Judgment in this course, but the
public so far is entirely unprepared for
news which must prove a serious blow
w hen it comes. The newspapers merely
intimate that the defense of the garri
son is proceeding as usual, but every
one has realized for some time that the
end was approaching and there is no
question that the majority, if they were
prepared by a preliminary announce
ment by the Government, could forgive
the loss of the fortress in admiration
of the garrison's heroic defense.
Possibly some of the hesitation of
the authorities here to make the an
nouncement of the fall of Port Arthur
is due to threats and rumors of radical
demonstrations, coupled with the ab
sence of the Emperor, but it is certain
that no demonstration is likely which
could assume serious proportions and
the radical leaders would be sure to
alienate the sympathy of many, even
of the more liberal Russians, if they
chose such a moment for a revolution
ary demonstration.
GEAR ADVISED CAPITULATION.
It has been learned that the last mes
sage sent by Emperor Nicholas to Gen
eral Stoessel vested the commander of
Port Arthur with jdiscretionary powers
and urged him to exercise them rather
than allow the defense to go to the last
ditch. This may account for the ap
parently brief time required to con
clude the negotiations between the
Russian and Japanese commanders, no
time having been occupied in communi
cating with Emperor Nicholas. It is
equally certain that General Stoessel
did not surrender without previous
authorization.
In diplomatic circles to-night, where
there Is every reason to believe there
is the best information regarding the
plans of the Japanese, }t is said that
the fall of Port Arthur will be prompt
ly followed by an offer of peace from
Japan. It is understood that a strong
effort will be made to have the of
fer come through President Roosevelt.
It Is even suggested that the terms
might Include an arrangement which
would give Russia an outlet through
the Persian Gulf.
There is, however, no indication as
to whether an effort to induce Presi
dent Roosevelt to move in the matter
would be likely to succeed. It certain
ly is regarded as unlikely that such
a suggestion should come through the
United States, unless the President has
the strongest previous intimation that
It would be favorably considered by
the Russian Government. It may be
added that, while it is known that Em
peror Nicholas from the beginning re
garded the war with great abhorrence,
there is nothing yet to indicate that
his Government intends to recede from
the programme of fighting to a finish
which is repeatedly announced.
BALTIC FLEET MAY RETURN.
There is much discussion relative to
Vice Admiral Rojestvensky's voyage to
the Far East. It is rumored that his
squadron will be recalled to the Baltic
to await reinforcements and proceed
eastward next summer, when it will be
decidedly superior in strength to Ad
miral Togo's fleet; but there is nothing
authoritative to support such a report.
The situation, so far as Vice Admiral
Rojestvensky is concerned, is not ma
terially different from that when the
Port Arthur squadron was first de
feated. It is known that Admiral Ro-
Jestvensky had alternative instructions
when he sailed, covering such a con
tingency as has now arisen. So far as
known he has no intention of altering
his plans owing to General Stoessel's
surrender.
ALL PRAISE STOESSEL.
British Fighting Men I.a ml the Grim
Old Warrior.
LONDON, Jan. 3.âGeneral Stoessel's
defense of Port Arthur has excited the
admiration of Earl Roberts, comman
der In chief of the British forces.
"It has been a magnificent defense,"
said the veteran fighter, enthusiastical
ly. "What a splendid fellow he is, to
be sure! How all the world must ad
mire him."
Field Marshal Viscount Wolseley and
Major General Baden-Powell also pay
enthusiastic tributes to General Stoes
sel, General Baden-Powell saying:
j "It is an honorable surrender after a
' splendid defense."
j Major General Sir Alfred Turner be-
I lieves that, in the face of such a great
I blow to her prestige, Russia, to rein
! state herself, will turn her attention to
: the northwestern frontier of India.
The London papers this morning dls
j < uss the fall of Port Arthur in all its
| bearings on future events, besides pub-
I lishing every available item of news
j and make quite an exceptional display
; of portraits of the heroes of the siege,
i together with maps and pictures of the
I scenes enacted. The sympathies of the
i British press naturally flow in the di
rection of Great Britain's ally, but
nothing could exceed the generosity of
the tributes paid to General Stoessel's
magnificent defense.
There is much difference of opinion
as to the lessons to be learned from
the siege, but the majority of the edi
torial writers take the view that the
defense of Port Arthur was a tactical
: error; that the fortress exercised a
fatal fascination for the Russian army
left Yokohama with naval attaches and other*
to sec the fall of Port Arthur.
December 29âReports that General Kondra
tenko had been killed and General Btoessel
again wounded were confirmed.
December 29âRihlung fort captured with
1000 Japanese casualties. Japanese also cap
tured Yanghphuban Hill.

and the Russian fleet and that, had
Russia abandoned Port Arthur at the
outset, she would probably have been
enabled to crush the Japanese advance
in Manchuria,
On the other hand, it is agreed that
its enormous strength compelled the
Japanese to waste their energies for
many months and prevented them em
ploying their full forces against Gen
eral Kuropatkin.
The fall of Port Arthur caused great
rejoicing among the alien Jews in the
east end of London.
OPINION IN FRANCE.
Stoessel's Capitulation Imperils the
Army of Kuropatkin.
PARIS, Jan. 2.âThe news of the
surrender of Port Arthur created a
profound impression here and was the
one theme of conversation in official
and diplomatic quarters and with the
public generally. The newspapers dis
cuss it at much length and in a tone of
sadness. The Russian officials here
learned the situation from the press
dispatches from Tokio and the Jap
anese legation received a brief official
summary of the progress of negotia
tions.
The prevailing French view Is
summed up by the Temps which says
the historic defense of Sevastopol has
now been surpassed. Port Arthur add
ing a glorious page to military annals
which will long remain unequaled.
Continuing, the Temps points out that
the surrender will exert a tremendous
moral effect favorable to Japan. The
Japanese, the paper says, are now re
venged for the loss of Port Arthur
after the Chino-Japanese war.
French military critics regard the
surrender of Port Arthur as rendering
General Kuropatkin's position increas
ingly dangerous, as the besieging army
of 80,000 men is now released and will
reinforce the Japanese army in the
north. It is expected that Admiral
Rojestvensky's squadron will proceed
no farther in the direction of the seat
of war.
The hope is expressed in some of
ficial quarters that the surrender of
the fortress will hasten peace, but the
prevailing view is that the fall will
accentuate Russia's resistance. # Some
Paris journals assert that Japanese oc
cupation of Port Arthur will consti
tute a menace to all Europe, which the
chancellories should prepare to meet.
BRITAIN'S ATTITUDE UNCHANGED
No Thought of Intervening in the In
terest of Peace.
LONDON, Jan. 2.âThe capitulation
of Port Arthur was the sensation of
London to-day. It was the one topic
of discussion from the street corners,
where groups were sheltered from the
driving snow, to the comfortable ser
vice clubs, the legations and the resi
dences and offices of Cabinet Ministers.
Everywhere the utmost admiration
was expressed for the defenders and
thÂ»i attacking army and the proba
bility that General Nogi has made con
cessions to the gallant General Stoes
sel is received with much satisfaction.
The announcement of the fall of the
Russian stronghold created little sur
prise in official and diplomatic circles,
where it has been discounted by recent
events. It was known as early as Oc
tober* that, notwithstanding the brave
showing in the official dispatches,
Stoessel's resources were nearly at an
end.
Nowhere, not even at the Russian
embassy, was there a doubt concern
ing the generosity of the Japanese in
the arrangement of the final terms. In
diplomatic circles the main question
was that of the effect of the surrender.
The consensus of opinion was that it
might tend in the direction of peace,
but none dared venture to say that
peace was in sight. It is believed it
will do no more than to bring out sug
gestions from foreign Governments.
At the Foreign Office it was said that
the British Government's attitude was
unchanged; that while peace was most
desirable affairs had not reached a
stage where any foreign power could
hope to offer its good offices with the
assurance that it would be considered
a friendly act by either of the belliger
ents.
At the Russian embassy the same
spirit of determination to prosecute
the war to the bitter end was ex
pressed. In fact it was confidently
stated that Russia would regard the
surrender of Port Arthur only in the
light of fresh Incentive and would
spare on efforts for its recapture.
The general tone at the Russian em
bassy formed a striking contrast to the
cheerfulness and activity prevailing at
the Japanese legation. Minister Hay
ashi was the recipient during the day
of hundreds of telegrams of congratu
lation from all parts of Great Britain
and other countries. Minister Hayashi
declined to discuss the probability of
peace negotiations. He said, however:
The fall of Port Arthur will at any rate end
the horrible slaughter in one part of the the
ater of the war, and I sincerely hope that in
some way it will facilitate final peace. This
depends upon Russia and not upon us. It may
strengthen the determination of Russia to con
tinue the war at all costs. Its effect on Japan,
however, can not be doubted. Our fleet is free
and the release of the besieging army gives us
increased forces available for service else
where. Our bass becomes more secure than
ever.
Speaking of General Stoessel, Mm- I
ister Hayashi said:
The surrender will in no way affect the
glory belonging to him and his men, nor oar
admiration for their splendid defense.
a
RUSSIAN SECURITIES FIRM.
Values on the Berlin Boerse Are but
Slightly Affected.
BERLIN, Jan. 2.âRussian securi
ties, which are largely' dealt In on the
Berlin Boerse, stood the shock of the
Port Arthur surrender with scarcely
a quiver, Government securities losing
one-tenth of one per cent and private
companies' shares losing from one
quarter to one-half point. As soon
as the report reached the Boerse pow
erful financial influences immediately
met it with statements that the Rus
sian Government would not deviate in
the slightest from its determination to
tight out the war and by repeating the
figures recently put forward that Rus
sian finances, as shown by the expen
diture of less than $400,000,000 over
the usual budget since the war began,
would permit Russia continuing the
war more than ten years without
reaching a breaking point. It might
be supposed that the news from Port
Arthur would ruin the chances of the
new Russian loan, but the bankers
consider the loan is likely to be taken
without difficulty.
The military critics treat the sur
render of Port Arthur as the begin
ning of a new phase of the war, liber
ating General Nogi's army for co-op
eration with the armies before Muk
den and removing causes for anxiety
for the Japanese, who are now able
to risk more in attacking General Ku
ropatkin. Captain yon Pustan be
lieves the Japanese will now proceed
against Vladivostok and destroy the
last Russian naval base in the Far
East. Colonel Gaedke, who has now
returned from Mukden, says Port
Arthur's defense practically- saved
General Kuropatkin's army and that
the Japanese have lost in the attack
more men than the whole Russian
garrison numbered.
All the newspapers here eulogize
the courage and persistence displayed
on both sides and some of them re
gard the recall of the Russian second
Pacific squadron as being a possibility.
STOESSEL'S LAST COUNCIL.
Officers Weep While Discussing Pro
posal to Capitulate.
CHEFU, Jan. 2.âGeneral Stoessel
hoisted the white flag yesterday and
proposed to General Nogi that negotia
tions should be entered into for the
surrender of Port Arthur.
With the ammunition exhausted in
the northern and eastern forts, with
only 500 convalescents and able-bodied
men available for resistance and with
15,000 wounded men overflowing into
the streets from the shattered hos
pitals, General Stoessel decided to call
a council of war, at which Admiral
Wiren was present.
Amidst the shells that shrieked cease
lessly, leaving no part of the town safe,
the solemn and wornout officers looked
their fate in the eyes. According to
one who saw the historic meeting, its
pathos was profound. More than one
voice was choked with sobs.
An agreement was soon reached. The
terms which the council of war decided
to accept were to be honorable: other
wise the garrison, would die fighting.
This was the sentiment generally ex
pressed by those present at the coun
cil.
Then orders flew quickly. Soon two
great explosions occurred in two forts
near the railway, which, having no am
munition, had. been destroyed by the
Russians.
The remnant of the garrison, which
had retreated, was now prepared to
fight to the last in the harbor forts,
where all available stores had been col
lected, unless the terms offered by Gen
eral Nogi should prove to be generous.
Although General Nogi had not occu
pied all the northern forts last night,
the general opinion among the Rus
sians was that their possession by the
Japanese would be merely a matter of
assaulting them.
Rihlung Mountain fort when
the ammunition there had been ex
hausted and the garrison almost to a
man had died fighting with bayonets
and with their rifles used as clubs.
PRESS BREAKS THE NEWS.
Russian Populace Informed of the
Citadel's Surrender.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 3, 7 a. m.â
The Novoe Vremya and the Rubs
briefly and sorrowfully announce the
fall of Port Arthur. Those journals
say that it will be sad news to Rus
sians, though jt has been expected and
regarded as inevitable for weeks past.
Both papers passionately call upon the
country not to let the bloodshed dur
ing the last seven and a half months
in defense of the fortress go for
naught, but to continue the war with
â¦he same steadfastness of purpose as
before.
The Novoe Vremya editorially de
clares that it has authoritative news
that British warships are following
Vice Admiral Rojestvensky's squadron
and reporting Its disposition and move
ments to Tokio from each cable port
reached. The paper adds that the
North Sea incident has shown that Ro-
Jestvensky is a man whom it is danger
ous to tamper with and advises the
British Government to call off its "of
ficial spies," and thereby prevent the
possibility of the occurrence "in the

WAR VESSELS DISARM.
Escaped Russian Craft Put Out of
Commission at Chefu.
CHEFU, Jan. 3, 10:30 a, m.âA third
Russian launch has just arrived from
Port Arthur. Four of the Japanese
torpedo boat destroyers have departed.
Chinese report having heard heavy
firing at sea last night.
CHEFU, Jan. 2.âThe Russian tor
pedo boat destroyers Skory, Stratni.
Vlastni and Serdity, which escaped
from Port Arthur and reached this
harbor, have been disarmed. The
Japanese warships which followed
them in have left the harbor and are
on guard outside. It is now believed
that there will be no trouble, as the
Russians are seemingly sincere in the
disarmament of their destroyers.
Two other destroyers, the Smoly and
the Boiki, accompanied by a transport
carrying 800 wounded Russian soldiers,
have reached the German port of
Tsingtau.
Cars Collide, Several Hurt.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 2. âA street
car collision occurred in front of the
Raymond Hotel at Pasadena this aft
ernoon, in which a Japanese had his
leg broken, an unknown woman was
severely Injured and several other
passengers received minor hurts.
OYAMA'S ARMY
AGAIN MOVES
TO THE ATTACK
Renewal of Battle
on the Banks of
the Shakhe.
MPPON REPULSED
MUKDEN. Jan. 2.âA heavy cannon
ade and rifle fire commenced on the
Russian center early this morning and
continued during the day. It is re
ported that the Japanese attacked in
an effort to break the center, but were
driven back with great loss.
GENERAL KUROKI'S HEAD
QUARTERS, Saturday, Dec. 31.â
The positions of the Japanese and
Russian armies south of Mukden have
not been materially changed during
the past two months. In few place;*
are the lines more than a mile apart,
and they are so close before the Japs
anese left that loud 'talking in the
Russian trenches can be plainly
heard.
, Though the Russians became very
quiet during the first half of Decem
ber, they have renewed the bombard
ment of the Japanese center and left
in the past fortnight, and they have
selected several points to which they
devote the most attention. The Japs
anese usually lie low in their trenches
and remain silent. Often several hun
dred sheils will be fired in a day withs
out doing any damage, though
sionally a shell strikes an exposed
group or kills some careless soldier.
Almost every hour of the day or
night artillery is booming or rifles are j
popping somewhere along the lines, j
The Russian bombardment usually be- |
gins before noon and continues until I
sunset, but it is often resumed from j
midnight to the breaking of day. Fre- j
quent sorties are made by companies i
or by a detachment, when the fighting
becomes severe. Both armies are
using the hand grenade as one of their
regular weapons for close fighting.
Reconnoitering forces constantly
patrol the country on both flanks to
guard against offensive movements
and to protect the auxiliary lines of
The Japanese soldiers are all
clothed in furs and heavy overcoats,
and the equipment and supplying of
the army continues, as it has been
since the Japanese landed In Korea
nearly a year ago, to be almost above
criticism.
Russian Cruisers Need Repairs.
ST. PETERSBURG. Jan. 2.âThe
delay in the Russian cruisers Izumrud
and Oleg leaving Suda Bay, Island of
Crete, is explained by the Admiralty
as being due to the necessity for ef
fecting repairs of their boilers. The
ships are new and started on then
voyage to the Mediterranean practi
cally in the nature of a trial trip, but
it Is said that the defects developed
are not of a serious nature.
Pope Hopes War's End Is Near.
ROME, Jan. 2.âThe news of the
fall of Port Arthur was received here
to-day at first with incredulity. Pope
Pius, on hearing the news, exclaimed:
"Let us hope that it is an augury that
the end of the war is near, now that
both nations have proved their
mettle."
Mayfield Saloonmen Arrested.
SAN JOSE. Jan. 2.âFive
keepers in Mayfleld. who kept open in
defiance of the prohibitory town ordi
nance which went into effect to-day.
were arrested this afternoon. They
gave bail in the sum of $1000 each.
They will test the ordinance in the
higher courts.

One of the Best-Known Sea Captains
Making the Part of San Francisco
Tells of His Quick Cure by
THE ELECTRO-CHEMIC
_ TREATMENT
CAPTAIN SAMUEL ESTVOLD. 332 VÂ» Ritch st.
San Francisco, Cal.
"Some time ago. on my vessel. I injured my
! right knee. A lump began to form about the
i knee joint and the Joint became stiffened.
I A 'ter that had gone on for a while I began to
I be affected In different parts of my limbs with
rheumatic pains. These were quite aevere In
I both my hips and across the small of my back.
!M y blood was In a very bad condition and the j
general circulation wa s evidently bad, because !
at times some of my fingers would become stiff |
and have a kind of a dead feeling, which was 1
very unpleasant. These symptoms I am sure
was the results Of bad blood and poor circula
tion. In this condition I took up the Electro
; Chemlc treatment and In about one month's
time I have been perfectly cured. My rheu- ',
matlsm is all gone and the lump on the kn-e
jis gone and there is every evidence that thf
I blood is now circulating normally. I feel that
j this Is a wonderful result to achieve In such a
I short time and at such a small expense, and
i for that reason I feel it my duty to make this
j public statement of my cure by the Electro-
Chemic treatment. I will surely recommend it
to my friends and I hereby recommend It to
all sufferers.

THREE PERSONS
SUFFOCATED
Two Elderly People and Sev
enteen-Year-Old Boy Are
Victims of Poisonous Gas
i
Three deaths from suffocation by il
luminating- gas were reported to Cor
oner Iceland yesterday.
Victor La Brie, the 17-year-old son of
Dr. E. La Brie, was suffocated with il
luminating gas last Sunday night in
bis room at 1210 Mason street. He was
found dead in bed yesterday morning
with a copy of a Sunday morning news
paper at his side. Qas was flowing
from a partly opened jet. His death is
supposed to have been caused by acci
dent, either by carelessness In turning
off the flow of gas or by a sudden
diminution of pressure in the pipes
while the boy was asleep.
The body of Mrs. B. Kelly was found
in bed yesterday morning at her home,
832 Turk street, a lodging-house kept
by her. Her divorced husband, Joseph
Bigin, who lived in the same house and
did chores for her, told the deputy cor
oner that he traced the odor of gas
yesterday morning to the room occu
pied by his former wife, and that on
forcing an entrance he found her dead
In bed, the gas escaping from an open
burner. He said that he and Mrs. Kelly
â¢ had agreed to be remarried soon.
Mrs. Randall, a lodger, who occupies
a lower floor, said that Mrs. Kelly had
been very despondent for a long time

MR. CHASE THINKS THAT
HEUER'S BODY WAS LOOTED
Elevator Man Had Forty Dollars in
Gold When He Left Home
Sunday Morning.
E. M. Chase of 1621 Stuart street,
Berkelc-. thinks that John C. Heuer's
dead body was robbed on Sunday aft
ernoon in the Phelan building before
the Coroner's deputy arrived. Heuet
was elevator boy in the building and
fell or was thrown down the shaft.
When Deputy Coroner Michael Brown
arrived he found that the body had
been taken out of the elevator well
and placed on %he first floor. He sum
moned Peter Semenza, the janitor, and
Dr. F. W. D'Evelyn as witnesses to his
search of the body. There was only
$2 85 found in the pockets.
Mr. Chase informed Chief Deputy
Coroner McCormick yesterday that
Heuer had about $40 in small gold
when he left the Chase residence in
Berkeley Sunday morning to go to his
work. Janitor Semenza said that he
and two other men had removed the
body from the pit and that he did not
see any one take anything from the
dead man's pockets until Deputy Cor
oner Brown arrived and made the
search in Dresence of himself and Dr.
D'Evelyn.

The third victim was William Roller
Sr., a native of Germany, 57 years old.
He was found dead in his bathroom
at 1516 Folsom street yesterday morn
ing. Gas was escaping from one end of
a rubber tube, the other end of which
had been fastened to a burner. Roller
was a bartender in the Owl saloon, on
Sixth street, near Market.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, JANUARY 3, 1905.
STANFORD MAY
BE ONE CHOICE
Selection of Subjects for
Statues at Washington
Is Theme for Discussion
Andrea Sbarboro, president of the
Manufacturers' and Producers' Asso
ciation of California and also president
of the California Promotion Commit
tee, says that he believes that Ice
land Stanford and either James Mar
shall or General Sutter by their ser
vices to California are better entitled
than any other two persons to be rep
resented in Statuary Hall at Washing
ton, D. C, where each State will have
two statues of its illustrious sons.
This statement was made by Mr. Sbar
boro yesterday after he had read the
article in The Call telling of the dis
cussion begun concerning the choice
that California is likely to make.
George K. Fitch, who edited the San
Francisco Bulletin for more than forty
years, said yesterday that probably
Junipero Serra, as an individual, exer
cised as much influence as any single
individual on civilization in Califor
nia. Marshall found gold. He was
not searching for it, however, but was
digging a ditch when the gold was first
seen by him. His find attracted the
attention of the world. Junipero Serra
had definite purposes. He did just
what he intended to do and the only
civilization that California had for
many years was that originating in the
teachings and example of the padres.
It would take a long time to think out
who were entitled by reason of excep
tional services to the State to be made
the subject of statues at Washington
as proposed. Many men had a claim
to memory, but which were the better
claimants he could not say.
Several men of prominence were in
terviewed yesterday, but they had no
choice yet. It is evident that a great
field for discussion has been opened
up. Whether the pathfinders, the
goldfinders, the railway constructors,
the educators or the founders of edu
cational institutions like James Lick
and Leland Stanford are the favored
ones will be talked over at length
from varied points of view. The gen
eral impression seems to be, from con
versations with tho#e who know some
thing about California, that there is
little doubt that Leland Stanford will
be selected as one of the subjects for
the statues.

CAR RUNS DOWN
CHILD AT PLAY
Four-Year-Old,While Throw
ing Ball, Ground "Beneath
Wheels on Mission Street
Death rode on the wheels of a Mis
sion-street car yesterday afternoon
and crushed out the life of little four*
year-old Rudolph Furrer, who was
playing in front of his home at, 2732
Mission street. The accident occurred
at 4:30 o'clock in the sight of many
people who were powerless to prevent
the tragedy. Many rushed to remove
the frail form from beneath the heavy
car trucks, and soon hundreds were
crowding around. For thirty minutes
men worked desperately to extricate
the child from the running gear, while
the frantic mother pleaded to be al
lowed to go to her baby.
â¢The car, No. 1143, was going south
on Mission street at fair speed. The
boy was playing ball with two com*
panions. According to the statement
of Motorman Frank Reynolds the lit
tle fellow turned and darted directly
in front of the car, which could not
be stopped in time to save him. Po*
licemen Edward Davey and B. Kelle
her were soon on the scene, and while
Davey led in the work of recovering
the body Kelleher took Conductor C.
A. Rollins and Motorman Reynolds to
the Seventeenth-street station, where
the latter was charged with man
slaughter.
By the time the car was lifted the
child was dead, and it is presumed
that he was instantly killed. A hasty
examination showed severe laceration
of the scalp, fracture of the skull and
several broken ribs.
The only eyewitness to the whole
accident was Mrs. E. W. Liberty of
2738 Howard street, who confirmed
the motorman's statement that the
child was playing near the track and
ran in front of the car. W. W. Willis
of 3118 Fulton street and T. J. O'Neill
of 219 Eddy street saw the car strike
the child and ran to his assistance.
Frank Furrer. the father, works In
South San Francisco. He returned to
comfort "his wife, who sat in the front
room at their home with little Ru
dolph's older brother and two
sisters. The body was not taken to
the Morgue.

COTTON PLANT
GOES TO WALL
Receivership Asked for the
Davis Mills, Located at
Fall River, Massachusetts
FALL RIVER, Mass.. Jan. IâAppli
cation for a receiver for the Davis
Cotton Mills was made here to-day.
The Industrial Trust Company of
Providence holds a mortgage for $500,
--000 on the plant to secure an issue of
bonds payable in twenty years. The
assets of the corporation are placed
at $587,836, and the liabilities at $1,007.
--342.
The mills, in common with many
other concerns in the industry, have
had to meet unfortunate markets for
raw material and finished goods. They
are also involved in the operatives*
strike. Judge Fox has taken the pa
pers in the receivership case in order
to consult other judges.
The failure of stockholders to pay
in full amounts to the capital fund
called for and losses in raw cotton
purchased during the high prices,
which followed the bull campaign of
Daniel J. Sully, are supposed to have
contributed to the mills' trouble, as
well as the tying.up of large amounts
of money through the storage of un
marketable goods.
It was announced this afternoon
that if the receivership plan is agree
able to the court as presented, it is
the intention of the petitioners to hold
it pending the adoption of a plan of re
organization by which the capital can
be cut down and new capital paid In.
Most of our time is â pent in getting
used to the things we didn't expect.
