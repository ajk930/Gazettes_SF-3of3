The same Questions were asked regarS
tae every member of the Jury, and the

"Do you know Thomas M. Bittencourt,
a Juror in this case?" asked Judge Law
lor.
"I do not," replied Ewald.
"Did you ever talk with him about this
case?"
"I did not." declared Ewald.
"I have received some information that
demands immediate investigation," an
nounced Judge Lawlor. "Call that indi

A look of bewilderment appeared on the
face of Governor Budd, attorney for the
defense. Maestre^tl shrugged his shoul
ders and threw up his hands as the
aged politician stumbled up to the wit
ness stand.
Byington secretly imparted the infor
mation to Judge Lawlor. The Judge in
/ stantly ordered the Jury locked up and
the courtroom cleared.
A few minutes after the afternoon ses
sion had begun. Detective Miles Bolger
told District Attorney Byington that a
man in the employ of the Curtin Detect

Detective Miles Bolger, wbo furnished

TREPOFF TAL.KS OF HIS TASK.
Klngr'M Veto of Separate Consular
3leasure Leads to Seeeaaion.
The dissolution. of the union between
Sweden and Norway has been pending
for some time and had its growth, in
the desire for the establishment of sep
arate consular systems for the two
countries. King Oscar recently vetoed
at Stockholm measures presented to him
by the Council of' State providing foi
separate consular representation, and
the Norwegians maintained that their
King, by so doing, and partly by his ab
sence from Norway, had suspended hlÂ»
rights and duties as King of Norway.
One of the causes for the desire in Swe
den and Norway for separate consular
systems was the fact that Sweden is
protectionist and Norway is for free
trade, and Norway's more extensive sea
trade and other divergencies of com
mercial interests had much to do with
the agitation. ,
By the treaty of Kiel on January 14,
1814, Norway was ceded to the King of
Sweden by the King of Denmark, but
the Norwegian people did not recognize
this cession and declared themselves
independent. A constituent assembly
met at Eldsvold and, on May 17, 1814,
having adopted a constitution, elected
the Danish Prince, Christian Frederick,
to be King of Norway. Swedish troops,
however, entered Norway, and, the for
eign powers refusing to recognize the
new King, there was concluded on Aug
ust 14 the convention of Moss, by which
the independence of Norway, -in union
with Sweden, was proclaimed. \u25a0' An ex
traordinary Storthing was yien con
voked and adopted modifications in the
constitution made - necessary ' by the
union with Sweden, and then elected
King Charles XIII King of" Norway on
November 4, 1814. ,- : \u0084 : : "t
In the following year a charter was
promulgated establishing new funda
mental laws on the terms that the union
of the two kingdoms should be indis
soluble and Irrevocable, without preju
dice, however, to the separatee govern
ment, constitution and code of laws r of
either Sweden or Norway. "
The law of succession was the same
In Sweden and' Norway. In the case of
an absolute vacancy of the throne the
Diets or Parliaments of the two king
doms assembled for the election of the
future sovereign, and if they were un
able to agree upon one person an equal
number of Swedish and Norwegian
Deputies were to meet at the city
of Karlstadt. in Sweden, for the ap
pointment of a King, this nomination
to be absolute.
The common affairs of Sweden and
Norway were decided upon in a Council
of State, composed of Swedes and Nor-
Wegians. The King had the right to
declare war and make peace only after
consulting the Council of State.
It Is said in London that the Chrls
tlania correspondent of the Times has
telegraphed to his paper that he be
lieved he had good authority for say
ing that" Sweden had indirectly assured
Norway that no forcible measures
would be employed to keep her within
the bonds of the present union.

served-wlth distinction at Austerlitz in
1805 and was elected Crown Prince of
Sweden In 1810, commanded the army
of the north against . Napoleon in 1813,
and, as Charles XIV, became King of
Sweden and Norway in 1818. He died
in 1844.
He ' was succeeded by his only son,
Oscar I, who married Josephine, daugh
ter of .Eugene Beauharnais, formerly
Viceroy of Italy. \u25a0 .
Oscar I died- in 1859 and was suc
ceeded by his eldest son, Charles XV.
The latter died In 1872 and the crown
descended to his brother, Oscar 11, who
to-day was declared by the Storthing
to have ceased to act as King of Nor
way.

Prince of Sweden and Norway. Oscar

Prince Carl was born In 1861 and

WASHINGTON. June 7. â The Post
ofnee Department has nipped a scheme
for solving the race question by issuing:
an order against Dr. Winfleld & Co.
of Richmond. Va.. who advertised to
make the negro white.
Several years ago the doctor met Pro
fessor Fontaine of Orasse, France, who
gave him his discovery called 'Mar
win," which he guaranteed to change
yellow, red. block or blue skin to shell
pink. The doctor took the remedy to
Richmond, \u25a0 and, without making: a
demonstration, contented himself with,
advertising.
The department chemists say the
lotion is composed of bichloride of mer
cury, benzine, glycerin and distilled
water. It will clear up a white com
plexion temporarily, but it will not
change the leopard's spots.

Canadian cruiser fired at an American
boat , to-day and two" Americans were
drowned; While the Canadian cruiser
Vigilant was patrolling off Pelea Island,
in the neighborhood of the international
boundary, it sighted the fishing tug
Grace M_ of Lo rain, Ohio, which, it is
alleged, was in Canadiam waters.
The Vigilant gave chase and showed
signals calling for a surrender. The
tug took no notice and the Vigilant
fired a shot across her bow, but the
tug kept on and made a dash for Amer
ican v waters. The cruiser fired again,
but the tug refused to stop and before
she finally gave in Captain Dunn had
fired five; shots at the American vessel.
I In turning to surrender in the heavy
sea the vessels collided, the tug turned
turtle and sank.

DETROIT, June 7. â From Flint*
Mich., cornea a \u25a0tartltnff report that am
anÂ»neeeÂ«*fnl attempt on the life of
Vice President Fairbanks wa* made
this afternoon, after Fairbanks . had
finished an address to 2000 person*
who Kntberrd to see the larlas of the
cornerstone of the new Federal build*
lac.
A man supposed to be an anarchist
forced his wÂ«t throasrh the crowd to
the speaker's side. As he reached la
| bis hip pocket for a revolver three De
troit detectl-res suddenly pouaeed vpoa
him. qnlckly handcuffed him and later
removed him to the police station.
The attempt to kill the Vice Presi
dent, report says, was witnessed by
a crowd which filled every available
Inch of. s|andlns;-rooai In Saffinaw
street, and cries of "Lynch htm! Lynch
him!** filled the air as the prisoner*
flghtlnjr' desperately, was carried to a
patrol wagon.
Even then the anger of the crowd could
not be quieted, for citizens followed thÂ»
wagon to the station, where the man
tremblingly begged the policemen to pro
tect him from the mob. The prisoner's
pockets were filled with anarchist liter
ature. \u25a0 'J.
Fairbanks was not disturbed by the
reported attempt on his life. The crowd
gave him a splendid ovation as he closed
his speech.
The prisoner had a published itinerary
of Fairbanks* trip in his vest pocket.
The Flint police believed that he had
planned to attack Fairbanks In Chicago,
as the prisoner had numerous clippings
from Chicago newspapers pertaining to
Fairbanks* visit there a few days ago
while en route" east from the Lewis and
Clark Exposition.
Fairbanks left for the East to-night.
It . 13 said that more protection will be
given him. as it Is feared that another
crank may make trouble before the Vice
President reaches home.
A charge of disorderly conduct may be
lodged against the prisoner, although the
statement he made after his arrest, in
which he is 3aid to have expressed hto
disappointment* In having been unable 'to
end Fairbanks' life, may lead the Prose
cuting Attorney to prefer a more serious
charge.
Fairbanks said to-night that he was
not aware that any attempt had really
been made on his life. He treated tie
matter lightly.
SrÂ»c;al IMÂ«patch to The Call.
The pale of th<- Coalinga-Monterey
pip- line may signify the end of com
petition In the construction of pipe
lines to Â«erve tho oil fields north of
Tehaehapi in rea< hing the coast by
their own means of transportation. The
sale wiil undoubtedly- be completed on
July J, when the option for purchase
will expire.
To bring the Associated Oil Com
pany's product to tide water on San
Francisco Bay a pipe line, some hun
dreds of miles long, was proposed. An
attempt followed to raise the money
to construct the pipe line by the sale
of bonds in the New York market.
Publications that worked in the inter
est of the Standard Oil Company gave
to the public statements that were
damaging to the hopes of the Asso
ciated Oil. No nvans was neglected to
prevrnt the sale of the Associated Oil
Company's bonds. They were not sold
and, consequently, the pipe line to the
bay was never corstructed.'
* Then the Southern Pacific Company
came next on thf scene and began to
purchase stocks of the companies In
cluded in the Asf<>clated Oil Company.
The railroad people axe now popularly
supposed to be in actual control of the
Associated Oil Company.
TACTICS ARE POWERFLL-
A few years ago the Associated OH
Company was formed in California
with a capitalization of $40,000,000.
This company represented the pooling
of interests of more than a score of
strong oil-producing companies that
were unable, singly, to hold their 4>wn
in the sharp competition in the 'fuel
oi! market. All their plants were ap
praised, their pipe lines, their capacity
to produce, the value of their product,
etc To each of the former companies
that made the merger was issued an
amount of stock and bonds of the
Associated Company, in payment for. its
former holdings on the basis of the ap
praisement. A much greater competi
tion than was in the power of the Coal
inga Oil and Transportation Company
to make was ia sight, seemingly, at
least.
The three largest stockholders of the
company that agrees to sell are William
Slatson, ship owner: the Crocker-Wool
worth Bank and S. B. Pauson of the
Hub clothing house of this city.
The deal was brought about with as
much secrecy as possible. Probably
the news will gre3tly surprise the people
of Monterey, and, not less, the ship
pers of oil from the Coalinga district.
The evident intention of the transpor
tation lines and the Standard Oil to
cut out all competition in this State,
by one device or another, has previous
ly been made manifest in a striking 1
way.
The net earnings of the Coalinga
Company have averaged $30,000 a
month ever since the Monterey pipe
line was completed and put into use.
The cost of moving oil to Monterey has
not been greater than that incurred, per
uarrel, in moving the sau:e commodity
to tide water on the bay of San Fran
cisco by the Standard Oil Company, via
pipe line, which is estimated at h cents
per barrel. As the Southern Pacific
Company charges four times that rate
to brir.g oil to this city by rail, and as
the Standard Oil Company has a large
interest in controlling the entire oil sit
uation in this State, the competition
that was brought into existence by the
Coalinga Company became a serious
consideration for both of the large cor
porations that have moved on the
Coalinga.
The situation has been talked over
with vigor and some heat. The Coal
inga Company, having a good thing in
the monthly net earnings of J50.000, was
Fattened to have toe existing status
i-ontiuue indefinitely. The Standard Oil
Company and the Southern Pacific Com
pany determined to get a compromise,
a sale or to crush their newest rival in
transporting oil. Yesterday all the
Btock of the Coalinga Oil and Trans
portation Company was put in escrow
in bank in this city and an agreement
was executed binding the Coalinga cor
poration to sell out under an option
that runs until July 1.
For the stockholders of the Coalinga
Company, who number but seventeen
all told, the deal was not a bad thing
financially. The terms of the agree
ment gives them three dollars for every
one they have invested. In addition
they have shared in the earnings of
$30,000 a month for some time.
LEVDI.VG STOCKHOLDEHS.
By a master stroke the Standard Oil
Company and the Southern Pacific Com
pany yesterday eliminated the competi
tion put up by the Coalings Oil and
Transportation Company in the trans
portation and marketing of California
petroleum from fields north of Te
haehapl. The Coalings. Company con
structed and has operated a pipe line
from the oil fields to the coast at Mon
terey, where connection has been made
by vessel for San Francisco and other
ports of the world. This line cost its
projectors $900,000 approximately, but
it has been a g-ood investment for its
owners and a thorn in the sides of the
transportation lines and the Standard
Oil Company. Only a threat on the
part of the Standard Oil Company to
parallel the Coalinga pipe line to Mon
terey was needed to bring about a deal
of great importance to those concerned
and also of concern to the general pub
lic.

problems that have long puzzled the

University during the next two months.

thÂ« orangre orchards. These experiments
will be made at Riverside. A complete
series of soil and water tests will be
conducted to determine what becomes
of the water that is applied in Irriga
tion to the orange and lemon orchards.
These experiments will be in charge
of Dr. Loughridge. In the vicinity of
Riverside, as well as in other orange
growing districts of Southern Califor
nia, growers have varied in "their meth
ods of applying water to land. While
all orange growers apply water in fur
rows, there is little uniformity In the
size and number of furrows used. At
one time, say the agricultural pro
fessors, nearly all the orange grower*,
applied water In small furrows, thereby
.Â«Â»aturating the surface of the orchard.
Such a practice id now believed by the
best farmers to result in much" waste
of water, j

OAKLAND, June 7.â The Board of
Public "Works to : day appointed- George
M. Flint chief clerk In the Superinten
dent of Street's office, to fill the vacancy
caused by the resignation of Richard B.
Ayer. now/chief deputy in the ; City.
Treasurer's office. This action \u25a0 follows
the attempt of frienda of D. W. Doody,
formerly secretary, of the Board of
Health, to ; provide a place for him in
i the Street Department by vacating the
position of assistant clerk, Which Flint
had held, and recreating 1 it. for Doody.
The board's move to-day was based
.on a recommendation- made by Charles
F. Ott, Superintendent of.: Streets. 'In
his letter to the board Ott says there Is
no further. 1 need: of an assistant clerk,
as the heavy extra work entailed upon
the clerical force by the extensive sewer
assessment " computing required last
year has been completed. '
In promoting Flint and receiving the
other recommendation from the Super
intendent of Streets, the Boai;d has ta
ken the stand that it is the controlling
head of the Street Department. Ott's
letter reads'as follows: *.v
_, \u25a0\u25a0". â¢ OAKLAND, June 6, 1905. '
Tlie Honorable Board of Public Worka of the
City of Oakland â Gentlemen: I 'respectfully
recommend that Mr. G. M: Flint be appointed
chief clerk in -this 'of nee. ThlW position was
lately^ held by Mr. Ayer. but is now vacant.
Mr. Flint la wholly competent and efficient,
ana is thoroughly conversant with the duties of
the office and familiar with the technical re
quirements of the street law.
Last year the City Council authorized the
additional clerkship because of the extra pres
sure of the office force due to numerous district
o&scfcfcments and other public work. Mr. Flint
was employed under this authority. When Mr.
Ayer resigned, however, most 6f the extra work
had been done and the Commissioners did not
wish the expense of, an extra clerk if the of
fice could bo conducted without, and therefore
the position was left vacant, Mr. Flint'per
forming Its .duties. The City Council how
ever, at its last Z meeting passed resolutions
which legislate Mr. Flint out and Mr. D. W.
Doody Into his place, ilt Is very necessary to
have some one in thla office who is familiar
with Its duties, which are not those of ordinary
office work. I therefore desire to retain the
services of Mr. Flint. Tho salaries of the two
position^ are the came. There is no necessity
for extra clerical' help at present. Yours re

a few days ago on the mountain ranch, of
Pierre Klein, a few miles from Mountain

Indigenous \u25a0to the soil of the United States

found in this country. The one found on. the
Klein ranch was a fully developed specimen
o* the Italian variety (tuber magnatum). about
as large as an ordinary orange, of a reddish
brown color and when slightly dried weighed
three and an eiahth ounces. It Is believed
by Mr. Klein and others that plenty of truf
fles can be found in that vicinity. They com
mand a good market price, the one found
being worth about 50 cents. There is a great
demand for them In the French restaurants,
and if they can. be' found in this valley. It

LOS ANGELES. June 7,â Mrs. Paul
Goodside of San Pedro is dying to-night
from' a bullet wound In the stomach, in
flicted with suicidal intent in a cheap
rooming-house . on East Fourth street.
Her husband Is a restaurant man,- and
they have been married only two weeks.
Mrs. Goodside was the wife of Fred
Mack, who for years was prominent in
Colorado as a mining .broker, and , who
made and lost several fortunes. Domestic
trouble caused her to leave Mack, and
when she refused to return to him he
killed himself, leaving a pitiful appeal
for forgiveness. The shock prostrated
the woman, and she was in a hosptial
for months suffering from brain- fever.
After a time she met Goodside; who had
known her husband, and finally married
him. Within the two weeks 'she has been
his bride .she has confessed to him that
she regretted the second marriage, and
threatened to end her life. In the room
where she shot herself to-day was found
a note. In which she stated that she had
decided to end her life so that she could
join her first husband in heaven.
The jury was locked up in the Judge's
office for .fifteen or twenty minutes and
then brought in a verdict acquitting Mrs.
Vancuren. . . -'-\u0084-Â«\u25a0
A jury was finally obtained, which was
composed of Miss Stella Parks," Misa Mag-;
gie"^ Hughes,' Mrs/? Alice B.>Duff y, Mrs.
Emma Donrielson, 'Mrs. Philip Huhuenine
and Mrs. Phoebe Brown. -
Mrs.' 1 .; Flint, after many 'Interruptions
and objections related the following story
of the difficulty:
''Last Sunday afternoon I heard a noise
and looking out v from my house I saw
Mrs. Vancuren tearing:.down a rock pile
I had built. I went out and ordered her
to stop. She answered by attempting to
push . me ; away , but I was too heavy, for
htr/so she picked up a rock and pretend
ed-.to hit me with Â»t,.but she was not
woman enough to do it, : She then let a
post fall on my "right foot and finally
grabbed a pick and said she would. beat
my brains out I took the pick away
from her, , when she struck .me in the
stomach with her closed fist.
"What sort of- a mood were you \in
when the trouble i commenced?" inquired
the attorney for the defense. . . .
"Just like this,". replied Mrs. Flint, aris
ing from her chair arid'standing with her
armsakimbo. " : ...-'.'
\u25a0 The first one who was j examined as to
her | qualificaT'gns replied that she was a
citizen of this country and of age.' When
asked , If. she was a voter, she replied :
"No, I can't vcte, I am only IS years old."
She was: excused as "was another "who
said that'she was of age but, was not 21.
Another fair juror was excused because
she was not a citizen of the United States.
Mrs. P'annie- Vancuren. was charged by
her neighbor, Mrs.; Sarah Flint, with
striking her with her fist with great force
and '.violence. Both, of the women- told
the court :.that they -preferred to have a
jury composed cf members of their own
sex. ,
The array, of women" subpenaed ,- as
jurors was young and good looking.
WARDNER, Idaho, June ".âFor the
first time In the history of Shoshone
County a jury^ composed entirely of wom
en heard -the evidence -.in a case to-day
and rendered a verdict. : . .>
.Mabel Swaln-Plummer shed no tears.
Friends expressed^ sympathy - for - the
bride \ that was to be. but she stated
that she' was entitled to congratula
tions instead. :
The prospective bride, finding .that
her affianced one did not arrive as ; per
agreement yesterday, or last evening,
wisely remained away from the church.
In the meantime a friend of Morse had
telephoned from Sun Francisco that the
intending groom had sprained, his an
kle and could not come. A message
was sent back telling him never ; to
come. ' " - ' .- Â» -.'.:.
STOCKTON, June 7.â The wedding of
Charles B. Morse arid Mabel Swain
Plummer. which did not take place at
the^ First Presb*yterian Church to-day,
Is the subject of much gossip through
out the city. The wedding was set for
10:30. The guests arrived early and in
large numbers, for both parties Vare
widely, known: and many Invitations
had ibeen sent out. 'The organist was
in her chair and-Pastor. J. W. Lundy
was on hand, ready. to perform the cer
emony. The hour of the wedding; ap
proached, arrived and passed, but
neither the; prospective groom nor ;the
bride put in an "appearance." Finally
Rev. Mr. Lundy was summoned by ter
ephone to the' Swain' residence, and the
guests 'departed, gossiping . busily, but
really, not knowing, the facts. : .
! : Charles; Morse^was employed [until pi
few weeks ago in this city..; He was an
industrious young, man. except In the
matter of paying^his bills, ; so It is al
leged. At any rate, when he went to
San Francisco' several days ago, a
large number of bills against him were
placed in the ; hands of Constable Me-
Ghan for collection.
McGhan learned that Morse was to
arrive' in Stockton yesterday and -'be
married to-day, and \u25a0 the 4 officer haunted
the places where he was expected." This
morning l McGhan was' ready to serve
his papers at the foot of the altar if
necessary.

WASHINGTON. June 7.â Richard Cheat
ham, v secretary of the Southern ' Cotton
Growers* Association, who charged that
some of the officials of the Agricultural
Department had given advance Informa
tion of thrf last crop report and that some
official had manipulated it in such a man
ner as to create a bear market, had two
conferences with Secretary Wilson to
day. Cheatham submitted documentary
evidence which he believes will' substan
tiate his , charges. Secretary Wilson in
formed Cheatham, and reiterated the
statement to-night, that he would make
a thorough . Investigation of the charges.
Cheatham will not go to the President.
There are many rumors in circulation
to-night concerning the person against
whom the charges are made, but the
name is said to be known; to no ono ex
cept Secretary Wilson and Cheatham.
The Secretary said _ to-night that one of
ficial of the department has been named,
but that he would not be known until the
investigation had been completed.'. .
Cheatham left with the Secretary affi
davits and letters bearing on the cotton
report of last Friday. Secretary Wilson
has put the letters Into the hands of an
expert in order to ascertain if they were
written by .the man - from .whom they
were purported to have been received.
One of the reports about town Is that
the official in question is employed In the
office of the Secretary of the department,
but this cannot be confirmed. Cheatham
says | the evidence which he obtained was
all collected in New York City and Is re
garded by the lawyers of the Cotton
Growers* Association as sufficiently con
clusive. .
Secretary Wilson In a statement given
to the press yesterday denied that there
was any leak in his department, but he
expressed a willingness to make an in
vestigation whenever any formal charges
were preferred, as had been done In the
past. The last inquiry was made in De
cember.'l9o4; when the same association
engaged in a controversy with the de
partment because the figures of the two
reports varied -widely. At that time no
Irregularity was found, and Secretary
Wilson and other officials of the depart
ment predict a similar outcome now.

To Whom It May Concern:
jgx Ten weeks ago I began
Bafcsjok taklns treatment with Dr.
f Wong Woo. 766 Clay St.
'fcP 3 S. F. Had suffered with
.Ft* /. stomach troubles for years.
jF\g*k and for the last 18 months â¢
-^JSEaSsSJtt with spasms of the stotn-
%%?sÂ£!]Â«<&s? ach. American doctors
*#/*Â«JLiJliÂ»' could do nothing for me
but give me morphine to relieve the
pain when one of the attacks came on.
Thongh I had been having the spasms
every other day before taking Dr. Wong
Woo's teas, since the first week I have
had but two light attacks and both
these from eating improper food; I
feel I am 100 per cent better than when
I began taking his teas. One result '
that is entirely unexpected is that the
sight has returned to my left eye. For
year s I only saw shadows: now I can
distinguish objects quite plainly.
I also had chronic kidney and liver
troubles, with great pain and soreness
in the back; now the distress is entirely
gone and I consider myself a well man. '
I think 1 would not be alive to-day if
I had not taken Dr. Wong Woo's treat-
ments. CHAS. JURCEN",

The crowd hardly received a fair deal
at the hands of Davis. Every fan paid
his money to see the game, and it was
not played to the finish. Many of the
diamond stars do not take the public into
consideration at aIL They Imagine they
are the whole show at a ball game, and
when everything does not go right they
holler. The public should not be made to
suffer just because a couple of ball play
ers imagine they are getting the worst
of it from an umpire.
It was a good game of ball while it
lasted, and from the way both teams
were playing it might ultimately be cap
tured by either side. The Commuters
made several costly errors, while the
Seals' hits all counted. Many- of the fans
thought Mosklman wanted to quit, and
adopted the means he did as the easiest
way out of the difficulty. The score:

The fans were sore. They swarmed In
front of the grounds and passed out va
rieties of unkind remarks about Hank
Harris and the league officials In gen
eral. At that they were not entitled to
rain checks, as four and a half innings
had been reeled off and the game was
played according to law. The crowd did
not take this view of the situation. feel-
Ing the bunk had been han.ded out.
No doubt the umpire did give Moskiman
the worst of balls and strikes through
out the game. The doctor was sore on
the first ball pitched, but he had no li
cense to sulk the way he did. He was
kicking and acting like a kid all the time,
and this did not seem to make the um
pire a bit more friendly disposed toward
him.
There was a merry old time at the en
trance to the park when the fans realized
what was taking place. About ICOO lined
up and began to make a talk about
"money back," "rain checks" and "get
the umpire." They secured neither money
nor rain checks. The umpire made his
getaway, though one youth with a mega
phone delivery insisted that Hank Harris
give up either Slats or rain checks.
Moskiman seems to be the man be
hind all the trouble. He was kicking at
Davis' rulings from the start, and in the
fifth inning, the umpire claims, he was
called a vile name by the twlrler. The
doctor was ordered to the woods, but did
not go till a couple of cops came along
and helped him make a getaway. Iberg
was ordered to the firing line, and Papa
Van Haltren came in from center field to
register a few mild kicks.
The whole Oakland team was mixed up
on the field and the umpire pulled his
watch. When the four minutes were up
Davis announced the game was forfeited
to San Francisco, 9 to 0. At that time the
Oakland players were getting ready to
go to their places, though they were a bit
too slow to suit the pleasure of the In
dicator wielder.
The fans who came through with Â£5
cents at the box office at Recreation
Park yesterday afternoon did not get the
customary run for their coin. Umpire
Slats Da\i3 broke up the game in the
fifth spasm, when he called time on the
Oakland bunch after putting Moskiman
out for sulking. Davis took this extreme
measure because the Oakland players re
fused to get into action in time. When
the game was called San Francisco was
leading. 4 to 0. By Davis' decision they
win 9 to 0.

GRAVESEND, June 7.â There was
not much enjoyment for racegoers this
afternoon, either In the stand or around
the layers k in the betting ring. In the
stand they had a wind and rain storm
most of the afternoon? while in the
ring they saw some- of the "best
things" of the meet go the way usual
with "best things," to the great delight
of the bookmakers. It was one of the
best days the latter have' had in a long
time and their good days have been
numerous of late. . . ' .
Luretta ran the fastest six furlongs
of, the meeting when she beat the field
in the featnrerace at that distance.
She simply romped in and was well
played. Cotillion beat the odds-on fa
vorite Lacy Crawford in a drive In the
fifth race and lowered the track record
half a second. The selling race was re
newed after this race when H. B. Wit
tenberg claimed Lacy Crawford for

Battlir.g* Kdaoo Tnade a great hit at the
Columbia Theater, in Boston, last week with
his sensational boxing act. and racked the
hous* to crerfiowing at each performance. The
Battler was required to meet three men each
ci^rht for cr.e rourd each. As soca as one cp
;-onÂ«nt nnithec the three-niicute round the
r*xt boxer en the programme went on. aflÂ«>r
Nelson was given on* minute rest, thus fur-
RtebfaÃ the fighting Dane with a fresh man
i'-.r each round. It was a slam-bang aSair

round, and kept the houre in a continual up
roer. TSic Battle*- rot IlOuO for his week's

aprecrsect with him to play a return date if
he can poseibty (Jo Â«o before returcinz to the
Attell outboxed Nel&oa for tlie nrÂ«t three
rounds. After the first half minute ot ths
fourth ro^nd. when SCcbna floored Attcll. the
iatter never had a look in. N*ls3H slsaply
rr.urdered hisi. knocking hlra a.ll ever the ring.
Aitell resorted to all the tricks of the prlrÂ«
riEÂ£ to avoid a knockout, holding and hug
g:r4r. fc-t the Dane xrte cot to be denied. At
te'l was rte l-jckiest nu in tfce \u25a0world to last
through the sixth roimd. It was laughable to
lead about how Atteil had Nelson groggy,
when 5t is a we3!-known fact that AtteU is
tbovt tbe most hannl<?*s puncher in the busl
r.esE. Considering what a tough rropDsltion
the Dane is, you can understand how un
truthful tie report was. The referee stated
that if a decision had to be given the bout
would nave been declared a draw. If It lasted
another round he said A:teU wouM have been
knocked o - ji.
The New Tork Telegraph says of Nel
son:
Billy Nolan, who manages Battling Kel
son, takes some of the shine oS Attell's
recent performance with the Dane. He
writes:
Unless something unforeseen develops
be will meet Kid Sullivan, who Is han

ANSWERS TO QUERIES.
Ecdes makes this claim, -which deserves attention:. That the
objectors against the use of preservatives can produce <, no strong
showing of actual damage to life and health resulting from their use,
but the. deaths and intensely painful sicknesses caused by the,un
protected foods make a terrible array of facts. He adds the argu
ment that it is a big question of economics, for the non-use of pre
servatives must make an immense waste of food, and this national
loss will press very heavily on the poor. He believes that it. is
mainly prejudice which causes the war against chemical preserva
tives, and that these are merely an, advance on the 9W, custom
approved food-savers, such as salt, vinegar and alcohorand smoke.
PROPER use and advantages of food preservatives is the sub
ject of a study covering 200 pages by R. G. Eccles, who holds
a number of important positions indicative of his fitness for
taking part in the education of the public in this regard. He is a
I member of the American Chemical Society, Fellow of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science, and was vice president
of the Pure Food and Drug Congress in Washington in 1900. His
paper aims to present the practical versus the theoretical side of the
pure food problem. He is very strongly in favor of the use of pre
servatives, and presents some forceful arguments for his sjcleoi
the question. ''.\u25a0;
One of his contentions is that in cases where pure food
commissioners object to the use of preservatives known as chemical
the prohibition should not be absolute, but the regulation should re
quire the manufacturers and purveyors of canned goods and other
foods to plainly mark such foods as have preservatives, so that the
purchaser can make a choice or experiment with both. Thus will
the people get practically educated as to the relative merits of the
two systems. So long as the authorities do not find anything posi
tively injurious to health in the kind of preservatives used, that is a
fair proposition, and would certainly be worth the trying. < ,
Statements of great dangers to health that lie in the consump
"tion of certain kinds of foods that have not been made harmless by
the chemical preservatives are very impressive. Spores of the bac
teria which produce poisonous conditions in foods that are used in
the cleanliest households , are almost omnipresent, and Mr. Eccles
tells of one kind which if magnified a thousand times would be no
larger than the letter "1" of ordinary print, and another a million
times smaller than the tiny dot that makes the period mark. Yet the
germination of that pore in meat or vegetable might mean agonizing
pains or. death to a strong man or a whole family:
FOOD PRESERVATIVES.
The press gf State has the duty of encouraging the pro
ducer and of disseminating information which affects his interests.
Our cities grow first in our fields, vineyards and orchards. They,
are part of root and leaf and the sap under the bark and of the
blades of grass and grain, before they rise armored in steel and
stone and brick. v The futures of San Francisco and other of our
trade centers are being planted and pruned in the country. Cities
to be are growing iri the fleece of sheep and chewing the cud of
cattle on our plains and 1 mountain slopes, and are rooting with swine
and cackling with hens, all over California. When Eastern business
men, who stand patiently over trade statistics, note the appearance
of California fruits in export and say that the trade, so recent and
yet so significant in its volume, is only in its infancy, we all feel
near to the producer, here and hail him as an agent in our common
destiny. Then San Jose and Fresno begin to spell great things for
us, and to loom large in our future, and our hat comes off to salute
an apricot tree, for its price is part of our juice.
In regard to its fruit supply the world has learned to think in
geography. The prune was long a French specialty and its price
put it in the list of luxuries. The raisin was so distinctly a Spanish
fruit that any raisin still causes a vision of the map of Spain and
suggest the Cid Campeador. This is because those countries iden
tified themselves with their fruits. They were advertised by every
carton that went to market, and the producers were at pains to
hold the trade by keeping the product up to standard. The Spanish
raisin carried with it the economic Romance of the "golden hoof" of
the sheep, that had enriched the raisin lands while grazing them
bare. But our prunes are abroad disputing the supremacy of the
French article and our raisins are following. Our raisin export
doubled last year. In the two years ending in March it amounted
'to 9,820469 pounds, and the value was $580,985. Those figures are
not large, but they are merely pioneer. They are a beginning.
What is needed is to identify our prunes and raisins with the
localities most noted for their production. In France Bordeaux
and the prune, and in Spain Valencia and the raisin, go together.
Wherever a California raisin is sold it should in some form adver
tise Fresno as the locality most identified with that production. In
like manner San Jose should be the rival in prunes of Bordeaux.
Wherever a Californian goes he should talk of those two fruits in
expressions of geography, until the most distant consumer will hunt
. for Fresno and S^n Jose on the map. We also have a natural
monopoly in this country of apricot production and that dried fruit
export, is increasing. In the two years qnding in March we sent
.-ibroa-d 13,104,756 pounds of dried apricots, valued at $1,160,514. It
is claimed, and we believe the claim well founded, that California
can lead the world in apricot production. This being so. the apricot
should carry everywhere the whole name of California, for it Is
more generally diffused here than any other stone fruit except the
peacn.
.In the two years ending March, 1905, we exported to foreign
countries 114.240,095 pounds of prunes, of the value of $S> 21 7>Â°95-
In 1904 a great part of this export went to France and the fruit was
reprocessed at Bordeaux and sold as Frencli prunes. This fact
was ascertained by our late Consul at Bordeaux, Judge Tourgee. It
suggests a study of the Bordeaux method of packing and processing
Ihe fruit. If a Santa Oara prune can be sent to France- and by
mere handling be made to sell as a French prune, it can be similarly
processed at home and sold under our own label and trademark.
There is no sorcery in packing and nothing is known about it in
one part of the world that may not he known everywhere. We
know ali the art of producing fruit and our capacity in that respect
is tlie marvel of the world. Now our attention should run to the
market and to the preparation of our product to meet its tastes and
requirements.
THE invasion of the world's market by California fruit is so
recent and has been pushed so quietly that but few are aware
of the impressioii it is making. Formerly the, only dried fruit
export of the United Slates was dried apples. This continues and
increases. For the nine months ending with March of this. year it
amounted to 34.744.592 pounds, worth $1,950,744. We have no
means of knowing how much California contributed to the dried
apple export because we share it with the grea^ apple States of
Missouri. Michigan and New York, but when we consider the ex
ports of the fruits which we alone produce in quantity sufficient to
impress the world's market we get a nearer estimate of tlie impor
tance of our product.

PICKINGS FROM PUCK.
THE MORMON WOMAN.
A series of articles will be commenced
next month in The Housekeeper maga
zine under the general title, "The Trag
edy of the Mormon Woman." Some time
ago this magazine sent its associate ed
itor. Miss Marian Bonsall,* to Utah to
study the conditions there and gain if
possible an insight Into the home life of
the Mormons and its effect upon the
women. Miss Bonsall was more than
successful In her mission, and has re
turned with a ! story that will interest,
thrill and arouse every man and woman
in this country. Miss Bonsall says:' "l
am wondering If I will .ever 1 have the
same view of the United States as I had
before I came to know something of what
was taking place, day in ana day out, to
the very heart of It. If there was a
stronger word than tragedy to use to de
scribe the lives of many of the women I
would use it. What they suffer in the
name of their religion Is beyond belief."
Miss Bonsall's path of Investigation was
beset with many obstacles, and the man
ner in which she overcame them will
make most interesting reading. The arti
cles will be" the first adequate presenta
tion of the life of the unfortunate Mor
mon women, and are sure to arouse much
discussion throughout the country.

Testimony was conflicting as to the
quantity of water chipped by the Lu
cille while under lease to the Kohl
berg party. Boatman Hilton said cush
ions which cost from $3 to $5 apiece
were afloat. Young Kohlberg and his
companions said the boat was only
damp. The Ttohlberg party testified
that the Lucille was rented again and
went out shortly after the boat was
! brought in. Mrs. Ohnimus and her em
ployes insisted that the Lucille -did not
go out again that day. One of the Kohl
berg witnesses, who testified that he
saw the Lucille out with another party
later in the day, said on cross-examina
tion by Mr. Spreckels that he was not
absolutely sure that he saw the boat,
but was "pretty certain." . j
VOICES RISE IX A\GER.
Maurice Brandt was the star witness
for Kohlberg and Fred Brelesky of
the Protestant Orphan t Asylum and G..
M. Roy were prime witnesses for Mrs.
Ohnimus. Many leading lights of the
Schmitz administration were on | hand
to vouch for the capability and courtesy
of Mrs. Ohnimus.. .
Maurice Brandt's testimony was quite
pointed. He said to the Commissioners:
"When the boys reported to Mr. Kohl
berg that they could not get their
money back. I resolved ' to bring the
matter to a focus by hiring the Lucille.
The boatman did not know me. Tasked
if the boats. Indicating four in a row,
were for hire, and he said 'Yes.' 'I said
I would take this one, pointing to the
Lucille, and he said 'All right.*
"Mrs. Ohnimus contradicted the : state
ment . that the boat was ready ; for use
again. This lady was In a terrible tem
perâviolently cross. The temper she dis
played" was something the Commissioners
ehouKl take cognizance of.' Kohlberg
was angry, and talked loud. : I told him
he was hot, and advised him to keep cool
and let me talk to the lady."
-G; M., Roy, 211 Kearny street, was in
line waiting for a turn to hire a boat
when the scene took place. When .his
turn'came at the window he prefaced 'his
request to hire a craft with a few chiv
alrous remarks, wherein he * congratu
lated' Mrs. Ohnimus tor her admirable
patience . and the preservation âof - her
temper, under .the most trying circum
stances.
To the Commissioners - yesterday Mrs.
Ohnimus gave her version : of : the ; alter
cation i with Kohlberg and . Brandt, i re-;
marking " tha t the ? scene induced ' her -', to
apply to Captain Gleeson \u25a0 for police pro
tection. - She produced many letters from
prominent men of the city i testifying; to
her courtesy . and generosity. . She I. testi
fied that Mr. Kohlberg "shrieked at the
top of the voice," and planted; himself; in
the way, so that she' was ' compelled .: to
hire boats over his head. The' jostlingfof
the bystanders added .to his anger.; . She ,
The complaint of M. S. Kohlber, mer
chant, tl\at Mrs. Ohnimus was the "most
uncivil person he ever met In a public
place," was ln\*estigated. Testimony
was to tbe effect that Mrs. Ohnimus
and Mr. Kohlberg had quite an alterca
tion. The loud and angry talk was
beard by the bystanders. It was shown
in the testimony that Mr. Konlberg's
son hired the boat Lucille and paid into
the office a deposit of $3 25. With two
other youngsters and two young ladies
he rowed away. According to the tes
timony considerable splashing was done
by the young ladies, who were per
mitted to row foS: a time. When the
boat was brought back after the third
or fourth trip around the lake young
Kohlberg was told that be could not
get bac*k his money deposited as se
curity for the return of the Lucille un
til the boat was dried out. At this
period in the diversions of the day
Kohlberg Sr. appeared on the scene.
He demanded immediate restitution of
the money, planting himself in the line
of patrons so that business could not
be conducted.
Commissioner Lloyd, with all of his
skill as a lawyer and cross-examiner,
was not able to bring out from wit
nesses the precise language used by
Mrs. Ohnimus or that employed by Mr.
Kohlberg, but it was clearly shown that
each said something and said it with
an emphasis that arrested the attention
of bystanders.
Mrs. Ohnimus declined to recognize
Kohlberg Sh as a factor in the trans
action, as he did not deposit the money.
She testified mat he threatened to have
her published in all the daily news
papers of San Francisco and to report
her to the Park Commissioners.'
The Commissioners in executive ses
sion reached the conclusion that Har
wood was obeying the regulations
when he was forced to give up his ears
and come ashore and decided that the
services of Hilton as an employe at
Golden Gate Park should terminate.
The testimony 0$ Mrs. Ohnlmus, v Os
car Hilton and Everett Hilton was to
the effect that Harwood was brought
back to the ofSce for a renewal of in
structions regarding the use of the
boat. Mrs. Ohnimus testified that she
offered to refund to Harwood the
money. he had deposited for the use of
the boat, but he declined to accept it.
He testified to the same fact.
Mrs. Ohnimus. who holds the conces
sion and manages the boating enter
prise on the lake, made a good impres
sion as a witness. She described at
some length the obstacles which she
encountered in *her endeavors to pre
serve her property and to enforce obe
dience to regulations which were es
tablished many years ago. She main
tained that Harwood was reported as
refractory and that his boat was
brought ashore, so that he could have
a Renewal of Instructions at, the office.
HILTOX IS DISMISSED.
Charles H. Harwood. who recently
went to court with his grievances, was
the first witness called. He stated in
general terms and in response to in
quiries propounded by Mr. Lloyd and
Mr. Spreckels that he was spoken to
in a harsh and insulting manner by
Oscar Hilton and Mrs. Ohnimus af
ter he had hired a boat and was row
ing away with a lady. The testimony
developed the fact that Harwood
talked back in spirited style. It was
shown that Ohnimus and Hilton com
manded him to bring the boat back af
ter he had paid for its use, and upon
his refusal they went after him and
compelled him to surrender the oars.
He complained of the harsh treatment
to Officer Frtink E. Mahoney. but the
police officer declined to interfere.
There was a special meeting of the
Board of Park Commissioners yester
day afternoon at room 1000. Palace Ho
teL A. B. Spreckels, president of the
commission; Reuben H. Lloyd. W7 J.
Dingee and Superintendent John Mc-
Laren attended the session. The meet-
Itfg was called to investigate charges
of incivility to patrons by the manager
and attaches of the Stow Lake boat
concession. Golden Gate Park.
Detective Taylor arrested the couple
find they were immediately bailed. Ed
ward Lyon. attorney for Mrs. Cowell No.
2, tcld the police that Mrs. Hunter had
learned cf Cowell's inheritance and pre
vailed upon him to elope with her. This
elopement caused a sensation in St. John
owing to the prominence of the families.
The love affairs of Alpheus P. Cowell
and Emma Hunter broujrht them to
Judge Cabaniss' courtroom yesterday,
v.here they were champed with living as
husband and wife without the formality
of marriage after a sensational elopement
from St. John. Mich. The complainant Is
Mrs. Alpheus P. Cowell, frcm whom her
husband has separated. The wife claims
that her husband has been lured away
by Mrs. Hunter, who, she claims, has re
cently learned of her former husband's
accession to wealth.
Mrs. Hunter's and Cowell's version of
the affair, made through their attorney.
Maker Gallagher, forms a highly romah
story. When Hunter was IS years old he
worked :n St. John and there married
the resent Mrs. Hunter, who was then
36. The girl"s parents objected to
the match and her father procured her a
divorce. She later married an attorney
named Hunter, who subsequently died.
In the meantime Cowell had remarried,
but was not happy and he and his wife
aprecd to separate. Mrs. Cowell was to
pet $60,000 and obtain a divorce. It was
about this time that Cowell met the wife
of his youth, and she promised to come
to San Francisco and-Jive with him un
til the pending divorce was granted. Then
ihe pair were to be remarried. They reg
istered a month asro at the Bon Air
apartments, at Oak and Stan van streets,
as Mr. and Mrs. Cowell.

EAELY MOENING SAID
Bird in Golden Gate Park
Is Eudely Disturbed by
Party of Automobilists
At 5 o'clock in the morning on May
31 one of the proudest and handsomest
peacocks in Golden Gate Park was,de
prived of two of its finest tall feathers.
The bird was \u25a0 roosting â¢ serenely jin a
tree near the south drive; when a' party
in an automobile came along. One. of
the passengers, who is ; described, as a
lady, signified to the chauffeur, ; Floyd
Free, her irresistible desire to possess
some of the feathers of ; the sleeping
bird and Free promptly ; climbed the
tree and detached two. tali feathers
from the fowl. While Free was in the
tree Walter Franz, the owner : of the
autombbilef came up in:, another ma
chine and ordered the to come
down and let the bird rest.
The Park Commissioners got a hint of
the raid and asked the police to ascer
tain^ the name of the raider and the
number of the automobile. Report of
the investigation was filed by Officers
James 8..D0w and A. A. Hicks with the
commission yesterday and steps will
be taken to arrest the raiders. Reuben
H.Â» Lloyd was importuned to let* the
matter rest, as the boy. who pulled the
tail feathers of the bird is only 19
years of age and was persuaded by the
banter of the lady to , climb the tree.
Mr. Lloyd frankly stated that he could
not listen to the overtures of the auto
mobile party, as he had been retained
by the peacock. Commissioners A. B.
Spreckels and W. J. Dlngee are also on
the side of the bird, hence; there is an
impression that the case cannot be
squared out of court.
The value of the tail feathers cuts no
figure in the proceedings. The act of
disturbing a bird of royal plumage at
5 o'clock in the morning is not to be
countenanced. Even peacocks have
rights which automobilists "must re
spect.

ishing elements made digestible.
Â£uch imitations may be foisted on the
public for a short time, but the people
are critical anJ soon detect the attempt;
then the imitators go out of business.
Something like 400 of these little fac-
tories have been started In various parts
of this country in the past 9 years, and
practically all of them have gone the
"long Journey." Just lately, a new one
has come to life and evidently hopes to
insert Itself in, public favor by copying
" the style of the. Postum advertising in
the papers.
This Is a free country and every man
who makes an honest product and hon-
estly labels it has reason for some rec-
ognition, but the public has the right to
know the facts.
Postum is the one original and genu-
ine Cereal Coffee, made skilfully and
for a definite purpose. It has stood
through all tbe wars of the, imitators,
has won the approval of the^Physiclans
and the people.
People who really 1 seek to free them- !
selves from tbe coffee habit and at i
the same time to rebuild the soft gray i
matter In the nerve centers and thus re-
, construct the nervous system, broken
down by coffee, can rely on Postum.
There's a reason.

Civil Service Commissioner John W. Rogers
yeaterday Bled with the Mayor his resignation
from that office for th*> purpose of accepting
appointment as curator of the Golden Gate
Park Museum. Rcscrs will take tba place cf
C. ' H. Wllccmb, who ' leeently resigned. The
position pays a salary of $125 per month.
The Mayor has not announced the name of
the man to succeed Rogers as Civil Service
Commissioner. David J. Oliver, who was men
tioned for the place when Rogers expressed his
intention of resigning some months ago to ac
cept the position of secretary, to Congressman
elect Hayes, will stand a good chance for the
eppointment.
Rogers' resignation will take effect on June
15 and the fact that he will receive a good ap
pointment In this .city has caused him to
change his original Intention of accompanying
Congressman Hayes to Washington. Mayor
Schmltz verified the fact that Rogers had re
signed and stated that it was np to the Park
Commission to appoint him as curator.
It" Is an open question whether the Park
Commissioners will take a programme in the
matter of the appointment of Mr. Rogers to
succeed C. H. Wilcomb as curator of the
museum. . Two of the commissioners remarked
yesterday that they knew nothing of tbe
selection of Mr. Rogers for the place. It
was said that Professor Gruber was discharg
ing the duties of the office to the satisfaction
o." the commission.

Before McGee could respond Judge Murasky
cautioned both-counsel and witness, and every
body calmed down.
"Well." Nevills said, tumlns to McGee, "if
you don't know any more about law than you
seem to know about mining, I feel . sorry for
your clients."
"Tour success an & miner also seems to have
been impaired of late," answered McGee. "for
I understand that all of your Rawhide mining
etock Is in hock.",
"You're a liar!" roared Nevills.
The day's session ended .with a flourish of
anger on the part of Xe villa. 'Attorney Mctiee
for the defense -harassed Jrevllls.with so many
questions that. he. finally, lost patience.
Nevills gave ft as his opinion that the mines
owned 'by the '; Amador Tunnel. Milling and
Mining ; Company are valuable properties, and
the claim of ; the defendants "that they contain
no values is absurd. â¢- â - - -
\u25a0 "Well, his company owned the Utica on the
north, and one day I discovered that the pay
chute of the Utica had fallen over into my
ground, but that Hobart was keeping right af
ter it. I went to him and said, 'I am going to
enjoin you in the . morning.' He said, - 'Don't
let us have any trouble regarding this; "What
will you take for your mine?' I told him," and
he paid it on the spot.*" '".'.'\u25a0\u25a0â¢ \
"Then hff said to me: 'What did you jump
at my offer so quick for?' I told him because
the real pay chute of the mine came in from
the west wall, but that other people owned the
chute, as it came In 'from outside of the
Stickels side lines. Then ne had to akurry
around and buy the outside properties. I con
sidered that I was right in taking the action
I did, because I caught him stealing ore from
my ground, and the best thing he could. do was
what he did do, buy me out quick.' 'â¢
Continuing. Nevills said that he started .in
the mining . business In 1564.* working under
ground as a common miner in the Lake Supe
rior region. Leaving there he went to Dead
wood. 8. D.,*and thence to Fort Bowie, South
ern Arizona, \u25a0 where he labored as a miner.
Then he went to Kern County, finally drifting
to Amador, Tuolurone and Calaveras counties,
where he >engaged In the mining business for.
himself.": It was in the last three counties that
he amassed his millions.*- \ â¢- . - -
"Why did you sell It to Hobartr"
: Some inside \u25a0 facts -as to how the Hobart-
Hay ward-Lane combination got hold of the
Stickels mine, ( now one of the best producers of
the Utica Consolidated Company, came to light
yesterday when W. A.--Nevllls was called as a
witness in his own behalf in the suit in which
he and Senator- John P. Jones of Nevada are
seeking to make "William Flemmlng and others
pay $150,000 due on a contract for. the purchase
of a. one-half interest in the Amador Tunnel,"
Milling, and Mining Company. The facts re
garding the Stickels came out through .an ef
fort, to establish Kevins' familiarity with the
mineral forma tlcns of California, and he final
ly was brought down to his connection with the
Stickels in the early 80s.
â¢ "yes, I owned the Stickels and the .Rasp
berry Mine adjoining," said Neville. "I sold it
to Hobart." . '\u25a0 , .

Kelley, who is the one suspected of
inflicting the injury to Mrs. O'Connell,
to ( ld his story in a straightforward
manner. He says that if . O'Connell
swears out a. warrant for him he will
retaliate in kind;and have the automo
bile party arrested for battery. In the
meantime Mrs. O'Conner is in bed suf
fering from a bruised eye and a broken
rib. When seen last night she declared

, ; 1905,-t: byj the < Rev.^ Herman" Gehrcke," Albert
Stauche and ; Marie Dahlln, both of thlfl city.;NEW YORK. Juae 7.â There was hardly
enough business In the stock market to-day
to constitute a motrce power on prices. Trad
in? was listless to an extreme degree and
the price movement draered and changed con
stantly within a tarrow range. The rack and
Â£!Â« of i^ tisdln* <l*m*ixt Â«aÂ«-n theiroelves
ever to a discussion of the stock transfer tax
and were inclined to asree that the burden
cÂ£ that charge was a factor in the present
partial euspension of operation*. As a case
to test the constitutionality of the tax has
beon arranged for, there w*s a disposition to
await its outcome in the Ttmkir.g of contracts.
Stripped of the usual operations of the room
traders, the bareness cf the market stood
fully revealed. Investment operations or trans
actions by the banking element were not in
Â« vtder.ee. Amalgamated Copper continued to
occupy the foremoGt attention and the move
ment cf the general list was little more than
a reflection of the fluctuatioiis in the market
leader. The cooper stock showed a feverish
ton* and its persistent setbacks kept the early
market unsettled in sympathy. It appears
tkst njeafurcs cf support were Increased as
Amalgamated Copper got lower and this served
.to discourage the bear aggression on the stock.
When these -attacks were desisted from the
tendency ef the general list to advance mani
fested itself. The best explanation of the
advanc* is that prices declined yesterday and
the traders tad proceeded as far as they dared
en the bear side ir. view cf the present very
. r.arrow dimensions cf the market. Tsere was
â¢ a slight stirring cf activity among one or
two pools including Reading and Southern :
Railway. The increase in the dividend rate ln
Interborough Rapid Transit had rather an
encouraging efTect on the hopes of those who
have erjeratea ln ether stocks on similar 'ex
pectations. Tfce heavy output of anthracite for
May was favorable for the coalers. Prices
in the grain markets fluctuated under the con
tending Influences cf excellent weather confil
tions ior the domestic crops and reports of
*' unsatisfactory cenditiccj cf the European
crops, both of which influences, however,
would lavor the prices of securities. There
Tv-as a crowing "conviction that no extensive
ereraticr.s to be looked for ln the stock mar
ket until tie crop outlook becomes better
defined. There seemed to be no immediate
prospects cf a 6clutson of the Equitable Life
prcbiem. There was some revival cf peace
rumors concerning the Russo-Japanese war.
but the deaUrgs here for foreign account were
-ea a very small scale. The day's gains were
pretty well conserved owing to the almost to
tal lack o: either buying or selllr* and stag
nation of the late market. The closing tone
was heavy.

CHICAGO." June .7.â From* an easyrstart \u25a0 the
wheat market developed into extreme weakness..
Despite a firm tone ats Liverpool, opening prices
here were at a Â»Hght loss.' July being a shade
to 54c lower at 87% c to SBWIC ">. The weather in
the United Rtate6 ; was .' tsie chief Influence.
While . seme apprehension waÂ«s i caused by : rain
In Jjj Oklahoma. \u25a0 temperatures .' throughout ; th*
Southwest were much lower, \u25a0 thus : dispelling a
fear of premature ripening. The wet weather
in 'the- 'Southwest caused a:- moderate demand
and resulted in July, advancing to: BB%@SBÂ»4c.
The 'brightening prospects of an, abundant har
vest, : however, brought out : numerous selling
orders- from many, operators "who. had , bought
yesterday. /As trading progressed the "celling
increased In volume until general -profit-taking
caused ; a' severe â¢ break- in pnces.Â»- While news
was not entirely bÂ«Â»rlf-h.Â« there*. were practi
cally :no damage reports Of any 'consequence^
One of the principal bearish \ Influences was a
report by a Chicago crop expert estimating- a
loss of a little over two points In the condition
of winter wheat during May. This, was a less
decline than generally conceded. In regard to
spring wheat, this authority estimated an; In-;
create of nearly 2 per cent in acreage. The
condition of the crop, It was claimed,* ls ex
cellent. " A break of 2 to 3 cents In the price of
wheat Sat Minneapolis gave emphasis ito op
timistic reports on the outlook in the North**
west. Another factor that Induced polling wa&
a decline of 3 cents In the price of cash whe*t
at Kansas City. - For July the lowest point of
the day was reached at 86c, closing at 86% c. a
net decline of 2%c. â¢ -. - .\u25a0\u25a0 - , ;
Weakness of: wheat affected the corn market,
causing considerable profit-taking. \u25a0 July closed

A firm market - prevailed in the cat market

weakness of other grains; July closed %@%c

,The sisters in .charge of St. Mary's have
long felt the need of a- newer and more
commodious- building if or. their use as a
hospital.;; For the last -four i years' they
have been- planning ways, by . which they
would be able. to. build to suit themselves.
The first location that was seriously con
sidered was -the Richmond District, but
the doctors decided that this was too far
away \ from . the center of the city, j The
proposed>lots adjoining the park , are. very
suitable ! for- a modern hospital.: A large,
airy, building, capable of accommodating
a great number of patients and up-to
date in every detail will be constructed
when the final purchase of the land is
made.: . '
If the plans of the sisters in. charge are
carried out /St.-'.' Mary's Hospital,' which
has stood for forty years at the corner of
First and Bryant: streets, will move to
new quarters. While nothing deflnitehas
been done toward the actual purchase of
a lot for the new building. Mother Supe

will' probably, be selected is the block ad

" Upon this showing, said King, Sec
retary Stuller quickly objected to al
lowing the proxies to be voted. This
was in defiance of King's ruling. In
the midst of the argument the present
er of the proxies walked out of the
meeting. Stuller. having sufficient
proxies, elected his own slate, on which
were Dr. King and Scar, as officers.
' When the two found that they could
not harmonize the factions they im
mediately resigned their offices. King
stands by the financial soundness of
the company. He said that the mine
had already produced In the neighbor
hood of $500,000 and that it was shut
down owing to Letson Balliet's acts.
If the shareholders had done their
\u25a0whole duty.^eald King, the mine would
to-day be paying good dividends.
Both King and Scar admitted that
the conditions were such that but two
alternatives present themselvesâ either
to call another stockholders' meeting at
once and elect new officers or place
the company in the hands of a receiver.
King expects that an extra stockhold
ers' meeting will be called in order to
prevent the mine going into a receiv
er's hands. /
When asked If the secretary's books
and accounts had been examined. King
and Scar said they had not.
During the early part of the inter
view with Dr. King and Scar an ex
pressman entered the office and was
given two trunks on the presentation
"of an order. On inquiry as to whether
the trunks belonged to Secretary Stul
ler. King admitted that they did. Asked
if the were in the trunks. King
replied, "I do not know, but it is a fact
that Stuller took the books away."
King said that in any event he would
leave this morning for Wabash.
Dr. King, speaking yesterday of the
meeting, said that while the treasurer
reported that there was fISOO cash in
hand, the secretary made no \ report.
Both Scar and King stated that there
was some feeling against Stuller on the
part of some Eastern stockholders,
arising out of reports emanating from
certain persons in Baker City. .
Kir.g said that the Illinois Club, com
posed of Illinois men owning interests
in the White Swan, sent their proxies
out to San Francisco, but 'at -the meet
ing It was noted that they were dated
June 7 instead of June 6.
There was an lnharmonlus meeting
of shareholders of the White Swan
Mines Company on Tuesday in room

of Wabash, Ind., president of the com
pany, arrived in San Francisco on Mon

Horticultural Commissioner Cooper,
vested by law with large discretionary
powers, has been brought to a standstill
in one 'direction by a cause difficult for.
the layman to guess off-hand. , The ar
rival of the destroyer of the dreaded cod
lin moth, the enemy of the apple, has
been widely heralded. Indeed, that de
6troyer, armed with a snarp and rapiei
like blade, has made itself felt In some
California orchards and has given great
promise as a promoter of crops that have
\u25a0heretofore been decimated by the codlio
moth. \u0084 â¢
This . famous moth proceeds from a
worm.. Given worms enough, and the de
stroyer keeps busy, stabbing its prey to
death, and depositing In its carcass eggs
to produce innumerable other destroyers
in time. But now the operations of the
Horticultural Commissioner have been
Interfered with because the supply of
codlln moth worms has run short." Tht
first result is that 20,000 warriors import
ed from the south of Europe In pupa
state have been put on ice In this city.
In the solitude of refrigerating chests
their animation "is arrested and their
martial ardor is chilled.
Mr. Ehrhorn of the Horticultural Com
missioner's staff told the Interesting story
yesterday. The codlin ' moth destroyers
that were sent in colonies to California
orchards were busy. The breeding colo
nies In the ferry building in this city had
to be put on ice while the eggs that
have been deposited by the codlin moth
In ripening apples have a chance to come
to maturity as worms. The wormy apples
will drop to the ground after a while.
The codlln moth worms in the apples, will
creep to the apple trees under which they
lie and will attempt to crawl up under
the bark, there to perform their sham
in the work of keeping up the moth sup-
P>y. . \ v
There are not enough worms now in
view to supply the Horticultural Depart
ment. There will be more soon. The Hor
ticultural Commissioner to catch them
all has advised the farmers to put bands
on their apple trees for the worms to
, crawl under. The worms are fooled in
this way and get into a trap instead of
being sheltered under the bark of a tree.
As soon as this happens the express peo
ple will have worms for transportation.
Then the destroyer of the codlin moth
will cease to hibernate. It will resume
business in the ferry building, and codlin
moth worms will die that apples may
thrive. i "'- ".V

Since , : the; police became active in en
deavor to suppress the illegal selling of
liquor in the neighborhood of the Presidio
gates , the social life thereabouts has re
ceived marked impetus in the way of/or
ganization. V Clubs have sprung up; with
mushroom-like" rapidity, and where once
such. signboards, as "The Son of Mars,"
"The Manila,'.' "The Boy in Khaki," "The
Starry Flag" and "The Old ; Glory"
caught the soldier's eye and attracted his
footsteps,' his. attention is now" captured
by "The Military Club." "The Army
Club." "The Rightaboutface Club" and
other titular tokens of convivial associa
tion.. This development is ; ascribed by
the police to an idea on the. part ; of cer
tain "blind pig"j proprietors that by or
ganizing a' club they can sell liquor to Its,
members and bid defiance to the munici
pal liquor, laws, and 'the -arrest -of -Wil
liam Krisky, managing director of â¢ the
Osceola - Social \u25a0 Club, with headquarters
at Lyonand Lombard streets, within a'

do not pay directly; for the liquor they
