There is absolutely no enthusiasm
among the delegates over the probable
candidate. The great majority know
him only as the choice of . the New
.York convention. They do not know
what he represents beyond the claim
that he can carry New York and that
New York may give the Presidency to
the Democratic party. -
The strongest point in Parker's favor
is the fact that he is the leading can
didate of the conservative Ving of the
party and the only one. from 'a Repub
lican State which appears doubtful.
The conservatives are in control of the
convention. They have more than 600

ST. LOUIS, July 4.â The Pennsylva
nia delegates to-nighv removed the
keystone of the conservative opposition
to Judge Parker by agreeing in caucus
to cast their sixty-eight .votes for him
on the first ballot This takes away
the last hope of the friends of Senator
Gorman. Colonel Guffey, head of the
Pennsylvania delegation, declared
GormJM a quitter yesterday, and to
night he transferred the Pennsylvania
vote to Judge Parkci.; The Maryland
and West Virginia delegations will fol
low Pennsylvania into the Parker col
umn, and the South will line up .sol
idly. {
Without a probability of a -break
anywhere in the ranks of the conserv
atives, only the radicals and Tammany
are left to fight Parker and his nom
ination may be made on the first bal
lot. ' .
There are 270 delegates instructed
to vote for Parker, or less than.one
third. There are as many more who
are now counted upon as favorable
to Parker, because he is the candidate
of . New York. Former â¢ Senator Hill
and Sheehan count upon another like
body of delegates coming to their can
didate through the desire to get in
with the winner.

with callers, many of them represent

delegation, who \ insisted that "Bryan

Bryan is the only resisting force in
the convention, and this power of lead^
ership may be demonstrated
before the combat is r over. It frill, be
remarkable if he does ; .check the drift
to Parker, but Bryan has done .un
usual things in the past, and he has
aroused the hope of his " most ardent
followers that he will be able to do the
apparently impossible here. *
A rear contest on the platform is as
sured. No one yet knows what the
platform will be, but it is known that
the majority draft will prove unsatis

NEW YORK, July 4. â If prolonged

discovered by a well known practi
tioner of this city will revolutionize
thÂ«Â» science of anaesthetics, freeing it
from the dangers of ether and chloro
form as at present administered.
The process consists in the main of
an invention by which 2 per cent of
chloroform and 98 per cent of oxy
gen are combined with mathematical
exactness. Instead of being depend
ent on the careful administration of
the snaesthetic drop by drop the ap
paratus acts automatically, keeping
the chloroform mixing with the oxy
gen in a 2 per cent solution all the
time, obviating any chance of the pa
tient getting too much and doing
away with the risk of giving too
much.

DAWSON, July 4. â The British

United States flag on the middle flag
staff before sailing. A complaint was
laid with Collector of Customs Busby,
who, on the return of the Tyrrel, sum
moned Captain Ritchie and asked him
to give a written explanation of the
affair. The captain said he was forced
by the "clamor to raise the United
States flag. ' ;
A report Went around that- the
steamboat had been fined $2500 and
that the captain had lost his papers.
A representative of the American com
mittee waited upon Collector Busby to
plead for the captain. The collector
was obdurate and will report to Otta
wa for a decision.
Busby is the Canadian officer Who,
while at Skagway, flew the Canadian

The flag was cut down by an Ameri

his-offlce and forced him to raise the
American^flag above the Canadian.
Busby refused, but referred the matter
to Ottawa, , and, this ultimately led to
the lowering' of American customs flags

TOKIO, July 4.â General Oku has
forwarded a detailed report to the im
perial headquarters, answering charges
preferred by the Russian authorities
that the" Japanese troops were respon
sible for atrocities committed on the
field during the engagement at Wu
fangtien, preceding the battle of Va
fangow (Telissu). He says the charges
an; totally unfounded, but, on the
contrary, that he had proofs. that the
wounded Russian prisoners highly ap
preciated the humane treatment they
and their comrades had received from
the Japanese. It is the Russians, he
declared, that have cruelly mutilated
the Japanese who fell into their hands
wounded. General Oku then makes the
following charges f~*
That on June, 15 six Japanese scouts
were overpowered by Russian troopers,
who ran bayonets into their mouths,
through their . heads and cut their
heads and cut their breasts open; that
on June 27 the Russians captured a
Japanese cavalryman, whom they bay
oneted and then cut open his abdo
men; that on May 15 the Russians be
headed a Japanese cavalryman whom
they had captured.
General Oku asserts that acts of cru
elty upon the part of the Russian
troops are numerous and announces
his purpose to report in the future
every case which is" brought to his no
tice. He says he feels that he is not
fighting a civilized army.
Press correspondents are unable to
supply any facts in connection with
Oku's charges, because no neutral ob
servers were permitted to be present
on the field at either of, the engage

LITCHFIELD, III.. July 4. â In place
of the usual celebration, accompanied
with exploding firecrackers and the
glare ct a typical Fourth of July night.
Litchfield has been converted into a
hospital. All day relatives and friends
have sought to relieve the suffering of
the injured in the wreck of the
Wabash Flier from Chicago. Accord
ing to unofficial report^" eighteen per
sons were killed and more than fifty
were less seriously hurt.
Revised lists of the victims follow:
Shade and his father-in-law, Albert
Hodges, taking a hitching rope from
their carriage, proceeded to drag the
wire, which impeded their progress,
from the bridge. There was suddenly
an explosion. Shade collapsed where he
stood and examination showed that his
left arm had been rendered entirely
useless by the shock, a large piece of
skin and flesh was torn from his chest
in the fegion of the heart, and his
shoes were nearly burned off. His feet
were almost cooked. If he survives the
doctors say several serious amputa
tions will have to be made. , Hodges,
who stood near Shade, was hurled by
the force of the contact some twenty
feet, but escaped serious injury.
Later in the day Steve Bocciarinl. on
his way from Cordelia to Vallejo, drove
upon the bridge where Shade had suf-.
fered so terribly and. not peeing the
prostrate wire, ran his horses against
it. Both fell dead immediately and the.
driver was badly burned about the
hands and feet. ,- r</ '
VALLEJO. July 4.â J. Chester Shade,
a prominent and popular member of

tered by contact with an electric wire.
At an early hour this morning Shade,
accompanied by his wife and relatives,
left here in a carriage, intending to

As the troops were marching down

they encountered more than 1000 strik

mob gathered in front of the soldiers in
an attempt to prevent the latter from
escorting non-union men into the plant.
The soldiers charged the mob and with
fixed bayonets forced their way

ST. PETERSBURG. July 4.â The
general staff has received the follow
ing dispatch, dated July 3, from Lieu
tenant General Sakharoff:
QUIET AT THE" FRONT.
When the battle of the Talu occurred,
the correspondent continues, Kuropat
kin had all In readiness to retire to
Kirin. He believes the vaunted Japan
ese secret service is very defective, be
cause it did not discover the situation
and says it is now too- late, as at the
end of the rainy season Kuropatkin
will be strong enough to assume the
offensive.
A further mobilization order, affect
ing the reserve officers, is expected for
the St. Petersburg, Novgorod, Pskoff
and Baltic provinces. The order will
also affect horses.
LIAOYANG, Sunday, July 3.â Seeinjc
the impossibility of bringing about a
decisive battle, in consequence of the
retirement of the Japanese and the
heavy rains. General Kuropatkin, ac
companied by the military attaches, is
returning to Haicheng. Both com
batants are apparently inactive. The
Japanese have .retired to the sandy
part of the country Â» to await better
weather. The Russians have reoccu
pied their old positions thirty miles
eastward of Liaoyang. The two armies
are now bivouacked on either side of
Dalin Pass,-, which cannot be said to be
an effective occupation for either
army, as the deep mud renders impos
sible the movements of transport wag
ons and guns. No battle of^any-conse
quence has been fought there since the
Russians retired from Dalin Pass be
fore the Japanese advance.
The Russian troops are displaying
splendid spirit,' in spite of terrible
hardships. There is not a dry spot for
them to camp on and the troops are
often obliged to pass twelve hours . in
the rain before they can prepare soup,
with which to warm themselves, ow
ing to the difficulty experienced in
kindling fires.
The Russians are showing great con
sideration for the Chinese, fraterniz
ing with them and paying them good
wages and high prices for goods sup
plied.
The Japanese activity in the south
also is suspended. General Kuroki be
ing threatened by the Russian troops
from the north. â¢ An early cessation' of
hostilities is expected and when they
are. resumed the Russians will be able
to take the offensive. Troops are ar
riving here daily.
TWO ARMIES ARE BIVOUACKED.
The Japanese are evidently non
plused at General Kurop'atkln's tac
tics, as proved by their alternate ad
vance on Liaoyang from Fengwang
cheng and subsequent retreat.. The
Japanese are suffering greatly from
lack of supplies, the country being de
vastated. Two divisions are reported
to have fallen back upon Fengwang
cheng.
TATCHEKIAO, July 4.â All is quiet
at the outposts. General Kuropatkin
is here engaged in the peaceful task
of opening a permanent hospital of 200
beds, founded by the Manchurian Rail-Â»
road employes. The hospital is not
ye^full. It contains 151 patients.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 4.â The lat
est dispatches, from the theater of war
are to the effect that General Kuro
patkin Is still at Tatchekiao, and, that
the Japanese forces are stationary at
Senuchen and along the roads from
Sluyen- to Halcheng, Tatchekiao and
Kaichou, but they are maintaining
their advance from Fengwangcheng
over the direct main roads to Liaoyang,
where the effect of the rains is less,
appreciable.
There are orly twelve miles between
General Count Keller's force and the
Japanese army, and a collision between
them is regarded as not unlikely. The
Japanese are hoping, in case of suc
cess, to compel Kuropatkln, with Gen
eral' Stackeiberg's corps, to fall back
from Tatchekiao on Liaoyang and thus
force an evacuation of Newchwang. .
The Admiralty here has no news of
the sea fight off Port Arthur on Mon
day last, reported by Admiral Togo,
and is not Inclined to believe it. The
understanding Is that the Russian war
ships are still at Port Arthur.
JAPANESE ARE INACTIVE.
Bivouacs of Russian and Japanese
Armies Are Separated' by Only

They Hold a Reunion . In Their Old
Home. n
EXEMPTS GREET GUESTS.
The Exempt Fire Company of this
city celebrated the "Fourth and inci
dentally the anniversary of the rais
ing the American flag on Portsmouth
square, July 9, 1846, by a reunion yes
terday in the old engine-house on
Brenham place.
It was an informal affair. A num
ber of the old time 11 friends of the vet
erans of the volunteer department
strolled In and were received with that
cordiality that characterized the as
sociation in its palmiest days. Re
freshments were served and all who
called were invited to partake of the
hospitality of the old boys.
Among the visitors was Mrs. Ma
son Wilson, the daughter of John W.
Kissling, who was one of the earliest
shipmasters In San Francisco Bay.
She exhibited to the assembled Ex
empts and their guests a historic
document. This was the written de
mand that was served July 9, 1846,
after the raising of the Stars and
Stripes, on Senor Don Francisco San
chez, commander of the Mexican
forces at Yerba Buena, now San Fran
cisco, calling upon him to surrender
to the American forces. It was Signed
by John B. Montgomery, commander
United States sloop-of-war Ports
mouth. After reciting the fact of the
war between # the United States and
Mexico, it has the following pointed
sentence: "I have seized Yerba Bue
na, raised the American flag and have
men enough to hold the place.""
This was read and the reading was
loudly applauded. Then there were
cheers for the commodore who raised
the flag at Yerba Buena.
.It was announced that a close ex
amination had been made of the rec
ords with the result that out of the
1290 who were at one time members
of the company only 214 are living,
and that during the year ending June
30 the following members were sum
moned and answered the last roll call:
Peter B. Quinlan, Thomas Brady,
Dennis Jordan, Samuel Rainey, Simon
Fltzpatrlck, Louis Levy, William Cros
by, D. D. McClellan, William G. Bad
ger, Frank Atkinson, Frederick
Brown, Timothy F. Harden and
Thomis O'Neil.
v President Henry D. Hudson was the
master of ceremonies and during the
afternoon called upon ex- Judge Rob
ert Ferrrl and E. C. Stock to address
the assemblage. â¢. .
California has been praised much and
"cussed" more to-night. The decora
tion of the headquarters was completed
Tarpey says he regrets very much
that any friction should exist among
the delegates. The conduct of McGee
and Mooser has been most exemplary,
he says. The exemplary conduct of Mc-
Gee and Mooser is not winning them
any prizes, however.
Tarpey and Al Murphy are very busy
in their efforts to add votes - to the
Hearst roll. It Is slim picking for them)
but if they are discouraged they don't
say so. They admit, however, that their
acquisitions have- not been by delega
tions.
' A meeting of the California delega
tion was called for 9 o'clock this even
ing by Chairman Tarpey, but a post
ponement' was ordered that the dele
gates that are expected to arrive in
the morning may participate in the de
liberations. J. Harvey McCarthy, alar
tin C. Marsh and Martin F. Betouski
of Los Angeles and W. E. Shepherd of
Ventura are still absent. Out of cour
tesy to. them the delegation will take
no formal action regarding appoint
ments until they are on the scene, al
though all of the committeemen have
been selected, as heretofore announced.
W. J. McGee and Louis H. "Mooser,
the McNab wing of the delegation, were
at headquarters to-night,' and although
they are not pleased with the situation
they are not saying much out loud.
"We- have too much political sense to
expect anything from the people that
control this delegation," said McGee
to-night, "but we have the satisfaction
of knowing that ,we represent the best
wing of the Democracy of California,
We stood with McNab because he rep
resents the respectable element of the
party. Our eclipse here is only tem
porary. At home our end runs things."
, TAKPEY EXPRESSES REGRET.
"I saw William J. Connors last even-
Ing at the Planters, and, being an old
friend of many years' acquaintance, he
freely expressed himself on the politi
cal situation. Connors is the pro
prietor of two of the Democratic dal
lies of Buffalo and trains with the Tam
many people. He boldly asserted that
Parker would get the Tammany sti
letto and emphasized by exclaiming
that as a gambler he had $50,000 to
bet, if Cleveland were nominated, that
he would be elected."
TAMMANY'S KNIFE IS OUT.
"The spectacle of seeing, old faces
and again conversing with Califor
nians in the torrid, turbulent political
whirlpool of St. Louis is singularly
strange. Every Californian is most
anxious to see the end of this unpre
cedented political riddle. The Parker
men are boasting that they have the
cinch upon the New Yorker's nomina
tion, but in conversation with M. F.
Tarpey a little while ago he felt san
guine that the Wall-street nominee
was impossible. William F. Sheehan
and Norman E. Mack, two of Parker's
most astute manipulators, feel that the
doors are closed against all outsiders.
As I was originally from Buffalo,
where I had been intimately ac
quainted with both of these gentlemen,
they were easy of access and spoke
without restraint.
HEADQUARTERS CALIFORNIA
DELEGATION, ST. LOUIS, July 4.â
"Boom, boom, boom! First, flrsÂ£,- first!
California, California! Hearst, Hearst,
Hearst!"
It was a sad spectacle when Tarpey's
obedient adherents 'of. the California
delegation turned the foregoing loose '
in the corridors of the Jefferson Hotel
this evening. They had been practicing
this thrilling yell all the afternoon,, out
in the alley behind the Coliseum. Dele
gate Carmichael, author of the battle
cry, waived the baton, while the root
ers struggled to memorize the compli
cated line and master the details of
time and tune. Finally the rooters
were declared a perfectly trained or- j
ganization. Carmichael was congratu
lated for his genius. All spoke gen
erously and feelingly regarding ' the
necessity of hurling such deadly muni
tion into the camp of the enemy, but
It was agreed that the welfare of the
nation demanded its use.
So the rooters, stripped of dignity
but clothed wifh' hope, marched Into
the Jefferson Hotel. Delegate Car
michael raised his hand, and Califor
nia's campaign yell rang through the
corridors. The multftude gathered
around and gazed curiously upon these
men that had shattered the quiet, but
no one cheered. The rooters looked
discouraged, but tried it again. The
curious moved in a little closer. Panlo
began to show in the faces of the root
ers, but Leader Carmichael rallied
them and they re-formed for their third
assault.
DEATH THROE*S OF A YEMi.
"Boom! First! California! Hearst!"
Scared by the yawns of indifference
and stares askance the ranks ,of the
rooters broke up. They fled and Cali
fornia's yell had perished.
â¢ It is a regrettable affair, for its liter
ary merit must be admitted. There is
no word in the language that rhymes
better with Hearst than "first." True,
its meaning as used In the line Is ob
scure, but this may be attributed to
poetic license. Neither Delmas nor
Tarpey aided the rooters. They were
congratulated for their exerefse of self
restraint. It is hardly probable that
Delmas' desire to save his voice was
alone responsible for his failure to get
in on this wild demonstration.
Thomas B. O'Brien,' who is known
by every politician in California and
once made a hard fight in San Fran
cisco for election as Congressman, ar
rived at the Jefferson in ftme to be
present at the birth and death of the
"Boom-flrst-Hearst" war cry. For the
rest of the evening he remained
around the California headquarters,
telling his old acquaintances of his
pursuit of fortune in the mines near'
Butte City, Mont. Though he Is a Re
publican, Tom O'Brien never over
looks an opportunity to take a hand
in politics. This is what he had to
say:
BY FREDERIC \V. BISHOP.
Staff Correspondent of The Call. .
ST. LOUIS. July 4. â The action of
Pennsylvania to-night in voting to
abendon their favorite son and support
Judge Parker almost entirely changed
the situation so far as the divided sen
timent in the New York delegation was
concerned. Senator Hill was led to re
mark that with another Email accession
Judge Parker would be elected on the
f rst ballot. William F. Sheehan, who
has been the active leader of the
Parker forces, and August Belmont
deprecated this and argued that it
would be wise to allow the other States
to at least have the honor of naming
In convention their favorite candidates.
The news was received at the Tam
many headquarters in an entirely dif
ferent way. Leader Murphy at first re
fused to believe It. saying that he had
been assured to-night that the Penn
sylvania delegation would support Pat
tison. After the Tigers had somewhat
recovered from their surprise they still
pave it as their view that there would
be enough votes held by individual can
didates to prevent Parker obtaining a
romJnating vote, at least on the first
ftre or six ballots. Leader Murphy
eaid:
"We expected Pennsylvania to have
f candidate of Its own; but we are not
<*.i5heartened. There are still two or
three days before the nomination and
Tve shall continue active work against
Parker, not because we dislike him per
sonally, but we know thÂ»t he cannot
carry New York State."
Bourke Cockran ar.d some others of
the leaders In Tammany went over to
Alabama's delegation during the even-
Ing to try to persuaaJe it to consolidate
Â«tp ten anti-Parker votes. Alabama has
Twenty-two votes, twelve of which are
instructed for Parker, the others being
divided on several candidates. It is un
derstood that Cockran was met by the
threat by the twelve Parker adherent^
that if any attempt were made to con
filidate the other interests they would
adopt the unit rule and cast the whole
twenty-two votes* for Parker.
Still another rebuff to Tammany's
plans came from Virginia. Tammany,
assisted by Henry G. Davis of West
Virginia, had been attempting to win
the Virginia delegation away from
FarkÂ«?r. Senator i Martin of Virginia
trlrgTaphed to Senator Hill this after
noon that while en route to the conven
tion the Virginia delegation had voted
â¢unanimously to Bupuort Judge Parker.
The fact that the day has passed
without bringing to the fore any figure
around which the anti-Parker element
reems able to rally has taken a great
deal of life out of the situation. While
the contest over the platform and the
second place on the ticket will afford a
great deal pf Interest when fought out
in the convention itself, the majority
of the delegates and those who come to
see a convention and shout for their
favorites are almost . wholly interested
in the head of the ticket. The result is
that an air of apathy pervades the lob
bies and other places where the rank
and file assemble.
The men who are talking about Judge
Gray are met with the question: Where
are the votes to be secured to nominate
him? The delegations with "favorite
sons" as yet manifest an unwillingness
to enter into combinations, and in the
interest of their own candidates they
do not desire to antagonize Parker. If
by any chance there Is a deadlock they
all hope to secure votes from the Park
er column In the break-up. Nor are the
"favorite son" delegations such as can
be transferred.
In several cases Parker is the second
choice of the delegates. This is notably
true of the votes instructed for Hearst.
It is k not believed that the editor candi
date' could control them for any other
candidate, while it is evident that quite
a large number from the Northwest are
ready to vote for Parker on the second
ballot.
Gorman, Gray and Cleveland have
been suggested, but no one is prepared
to give assurances that either could re
ceive the nomination. The mention of
Cleveland 'has a tendency in some
quarters to solidify the Parker
strength, for many delegates say they
do not want to take even the slightest
chance of allowing Cleveland a fourth
nomination.
While there is a very friendly feeling
for Gorman among the Southern dele
gates, including those who are under
Instructions. or bound by the unit rule
to vote for Parker, yet the predomi
nant expression from this element is
that the effort now making In behalf
of the Maryland Senator Is too late.
They also point to the fact that when
delegates were being chosen Gorman
gave no sigh that he desired the nom
ination. It is too much to expect, they
say, that delegates who were chosen
as Parker men, whether under instruc
tions or not, will desert him now as
long as there is a possibility of secur
ing his nomination.
' The opposition to Judge Parker) in
its effort to tighten the lines and make
sure of holding the delegations now
counted as ' opposed to him, have
brought out two new candidates In, the
persons of former Governor Pattlson
of Pennsylvania and General Miles.
The opposition leaders appreciate to
the utmost the difficulty of preventing
a stampede to Parker, should his lead
become pronouncedly manifest, but
they are counting upon doing this by
appealing to the local pride of the dif
ferent "favorite son" delegations to
hold on as long as possible.
No. announcement was given out from
Senator Gorman to-night, and Vandi
ver, who had said early In the day that
he expected a communication, sakl to
night that he had received none. , Gor
man's position as a conditional candi
date, however, has become, so well
known that no formal statement from
him is necessary. His friends still ex
pect to press his candidacy If Parker
falls of success, and In the meantime
they will do all they can to bring about
such a situation.
The wisdom of casting the votes
known to be for Gorman for other can
didates has been canvassed and this
course practically decided upon. It is
not yet absolutely determined 'just what
aspirant will be thus complimented,
but the choice lies between Pattison
and Cockrell. The votes absolutely un
der Gorman's control are those of
Maryland, West Virginia and the Dis
trict of Columbia.
' ST. LOUIS, July 4.â "Parker on the
second ballot, perhaps on the first."
That is to-night the claim of the men
who are In charge of the political af
fairs of the New York candidate. All
day long the Parker opponents have
tried to perfect a programme which
would prolong the balloting and af
ford an opportunity to name another
candidate, but apparently they have
not succeeded. Many combinations
have been suggested, but so far they
seem to have proved incapable of being
assembled into a shape sufficiently sub
stantial to show the independent and
uninstructed delegates how another
candidate could be named. Men who
are supposed to hold the balance of
power have asked', the Parker oppo
nents to say what would be done after
Parker has been put out of the race,
but to-night they say they have re
ceived no satisfactory "answer.
After an almost continuous session
of nine hours the sub-committee, to
which was submitted the evidence in
the fourteen contests in the State of
Illinois, went into executive session at
midnight with every indication that Its
verdict would be a victory for Hop
kins and his faction. The evidence
in. each of the district cases related
to the convention at Springfield, where
Chairman Frank P. Quinn was accused
of riding roughshod over the rights
of two-thirds of the delegates and of
arbitrary and illegal substitution by
the secretary of the -convention of
names of men who were not elected
or even submitted to State caucuses as
delegates to the national convention.
The discussion was at times very
warm.
A long and bitter fight was waged
before the sub-committee that^ heard
the contest In the Twelfth Ohio Dis
trict, where C. D. Saviers and John C.
L. Pugh, two Hearst men, are seeking
to unseat James Ross and C. F. Gil
liam. Allan Thurman made two
speeches for Ross and Gilliam and John
J. Lentz spoke twice for the contest
ants. Saviers, Ross and Pugh also
spoke In their own behalf., Gilliam de
clined, saying that it was not neces
sary for him to speak. It Is claimed by
the contestants that they were not
given sufficient time prior to the meet
ing of the committee to certify all of
their delegates and were therefore de
prived of 176 votes. The sub-committee
decided to report in favor of the con
testees. Roes and Gilliam.
In the contested case in the Tenth
Indiana District, which was referred
to the sub-committee of which Senator
Tillman was chairman, it was decided
after both sides had been heard that
the case was not one In which the na
tional committee had Jurisdiction, the
regular delegates having been duly de
clared elected bV the Indiana Demo
cratic State Convention. The flght in
this district was between the Hearst
and the Parker factions. The result of
the decision of the sub-committee is
that the Parker delegates, Daniel
Elmms and Martin Kruger, will be
recommended to the national commit
tee by the sub-committee as the regu
lar delegates.
VICTORY FOR HOPKINS.
The sub-committee which heard the
evidence in the contests in the First,
Second, Sixth and Eighth New Jersey
districts adjourned without action.
The South Dakota contest flattened
out and the regular delegate was not
disturbed.

sion Immediately following the adjourn,
ment of the national committee. The
committee will meet again to-morrow
at 10 o'clock, when the sub-committees
will report.
HEARST CONTESTS FAIL.
The committee reconvened at 2
o'clock in the afternoon, and Chairman
Jones announced the sub-committees
to listen to the evidence In the contests
as follows:
Illinoisâ William J. Stone, Missouri
(chairman); Adair Wilson, Colorado;
T. B. O'Brien, Minnesota; Norman E.
Mack, New York; John T. McGraw,
West Virginia.
Ohioâ J. B. Breathitt, Arizona (chair
man); W. B. Gourley, New Jersey; R.
M. Johnston (Texas); O. F. Williams,
Massachusetts; J. T. Ellison, Virginia.
ST. LOUIS, July 4.â The national
committee, met at 10 o'clock to take up
the contests for temporary seats In
the convention. The main flght was
in the Illinois case, which included the
seats of John Hopkins and Ben T.
Cable, delegates at large, and two dele
gates from each of the thirteen other
districts.
William J. Bryan, who has made the
fight of the Illinois contestants one of
his own, was one of the first to enter
the committee room, having obtained
the proxy of James C. Dahlman, .na
tional commltteeman from Nebraska-
John P. Hopkins was there to fight
for his own seat, holding a proxy which
he had obtained from Thomas Gahan,
the commilteeman from Illinois.
The Harrison and Hearst factions
scored the lirst success before the com
mittee. As soon as the Illinois flght
was taken up it was agreed by both
sides that the better way to settle the
dispute was to permit it to rest with
a sub-committee, which should report
to the national committee later. The
Important issue then came on the man
ner of the appointment of the sub
committee. Chairman James K. Jones
of the national committee Is favorably
Inclined to the Harrison and Hearst
people, and they naturally desired to
have him appoint the committee. John
P. Hopkins made a vigorous argument
in favor of the appointment of the
sub-committee by votes of the national
committee. The firet test of strength
came on the vote, and the national
committee voted in favor of the Harri
son and Hearst plan of selection by 25
to 16.
SUB- COMMITTEES XAMED.
Only three men are mentioned now
in connection With the nomination for
the Presidencyâ W. V. Allen of Ne
braska, Samuel Williams of Indiana and
Thomas E. Watson.' Allen, refused to
enter into a scramble for the nomina
tion and to-nighf intimated that he
would not accept the honor if there
was going to be any contest over it.
He wants the nomination to come to
him unanimously. Watson is in a sim
ilar state of feeling and he wrote a
letter, it is said, toÂ»the effect that he
did not want to be the standard bearer
for the Populists this year.
Williams of Indiana Is leaving noth
ing undone to capture the nomination
and his friends say that if he cannot
get first place he is willing to take
second.
While the platform is not completed,
some of the, more prominent men have
made an outline of It. It is said. that
former Senator Allen will have more
to say about the platform than any
other person. The sentiment favors
the adoption of the Omaha platform of
1S92, with planks for postal savings and
initiative and referendum.
At largeâ J. H. Edmiston, Nebraska,
chairman; Frank W. Owers, Colorado;
Dr. 8. D. Burdick, Indian Territory;
E. "W. Ridgley, Kansas; William
Clancy, Montana, and John S. Allen,
Oklahoma.
The committee did not meet until
late to-night. To-morrow nominations
will be made.
SPRINGFIEX.D. 111., July 4.â When
the Populist National Convention was
called to order this afternoon there
Were fewer than 200 delegates In the
hall, some 600 delegates failing to ap
pear. There were not more than sev
enty-five citizens present besides the
delegates. Mayor Devereaux, who was
scheduled to extend a word of wel
come, did not attend, nor did he send
a representative or an explanation of
his absence. There were hundreds of
empty seats in the State Arsenal. Only
twenty-three States were represented
In the convention.
The convention was called to order
by Vice Chairman J. H. Edmiston of
Nebraska and the call for the conven
tion was read by Jo A. Parker of Ken
tucky, national chairman. Charles A.
de France of Nebraska was made tem
porary secretary.
After the temporary organization
had been perfected the convention lis
tened to addresses by Allen' of Nebras
ka and Rev. Mr. Nelson of St. Louis.
It was 5 o'clock before the speechmak
ing was .over.
The following were made members of
the committee on resolutions: '

OWINGSVILLE, Ky.. July 4.â News
reached here to-day of a desperate en
counter in the mountains of Leeley
County between a huge mountain lion
and Mrs. Martha Miller, a young widow.
Mrs. Miller, accompanied by her dog, a
big mastiff, was walking along a lonely
mountain pike, when with a growl a
big lion sprang upon her, knocking her
to the ground. She scrambled to her
feet and grasped a stick, with which
she began beating the lion, at the same
time calling her dog to her aid.
The lion sprang again, this time
sinking h!j teeth in the woman's neck
and shoulder, terribly lacerating her.
Battling for her life. Mrs. Miller
struck the lion again and again, finally
forcing it to loosen its grasp upon her.
Then the dog attacked the lion ' and
after a hard struggle succeeded in
fastening his teeth in the beast's

Mrs. Miller is badly injured, but will
recover. The lion was one of the
largest ever killed in Kentucky.

William J. Bryan's address was pa
triotic and based on quotations illus
trating- the various qualities,^ of the
character of the American people to be
contributed to' the nation's unparalleled
career. Speaking of anarchy, Bryan
said that "he who perverts the pur
poses of government does, most to pro
mote anarchy."
There was a parade, which was re
viewed by President Francis, Cardinal
Satolli, General John S. Bates and the
different State Governors who were on

ST. LOUIS, July 4 (World's Fair
Grounds).â In spite of threatening
thunder showers there was a record
breaking crowd on the fair grounds to
day. The principal ceremonies were
held at the foot of the Louisiana Pur
chase Exposition monument, where ad
drtsses were delivered by Lafayette
Young, editor of the Des Molnes Capi
tal, and William J. Bryan. Young said
in part:
"The greatest alarm at present seems
to be in relation to certain successes
that are eminent or pre-eminent. But
there is no use being scared at the very
end for which we have fought; no use
being alar'med at the result of our own
ambitions. The republic is more Just
than at any other time. The laws are
nearer right than formerly.'
"No conspiracy of the rich can de
stroy or even endanger the Govern
ment. There are Americans who have
too much money, and no way has yet
been discovered to hinder their accu
mulations. The question of managing
the over-rich is one for the future. We
do not know its solution, but we do
know that we have solved all things
heretofore rightly; we will so determine
this question, and it will be without re
sort to anarchy or the torch. The first
tyrannies of the over-rich would be so
resented. The future will point the way
for settlement â point the way to a near
er approach to equality." ' '
At Festival Hall Governor Pardee of
California and J. Hamilton Lewis of
Washington spoke. There were pa
triotic exercises at the Pennsylvania
building, where the Declaration of In
dependence was read over the Liberty
Bell.
with a wagon load or firecrackers, sky
rockets and squibs. Jus.t as he reached
the outskirts of the town his cigar
dropped Into the straw at the bot
tom of his wagon and five minutes
later, when near the Union meeting
house, he saw the first sign of trouble.
A pinwheel, which was ignited by the
smouldering straw, was seized with a
tantrum, leaped from its box and
spread sparks through the entire
cargo. A Roman candle pointed
Wicks' way and drove him to the
woods. A hundred skyrockets, which
Inclined- in the direction of the meet
ing-house, let go about the same time.
They went in through the open win
dows simultaneously and caused a
panic among the congregation.
By. the time, the congregation
reached the open street "Wicks', wagon

pearing up the main street In a blaze,
of glory.. Fortunately no one was in
jured In the stampede to escape from
the church.
Alto and Santa Clara teams was an
exciting event, the local team winning
by a close margin. A ball game be
tween teams of the west and coast di
visions of the Southern Pacific roused
much interest. The coast aggregation
won by a score of 10 to 6.
. In the afternoon Mrs. Stanford waa
visited by a delegation of veteran fire
men of San Francisco, Santa Clara
firemen, Native Sons and Daughters,
Red Men and guests. The visitors were
most' graciously received. Jir3. Stan
ford made a pretty address extending
a cordial welcome to the university
grounds and assuring the guests of her
pleasure. Following the reception the
visitors were treatedTTo an organ re
cital In the University Memorial
chapel.
The visitors began to leave Palo;
Alto on late trains. The festivities
were concluded with a grand ball.
During the evening about an hour
was spent enjoying a fine display of
fireworks. The grounds were crowded
with delighted spectators. Fireworks
of all descriptions were set off for the
pleasure of the onlookers. The Veter
ans' Home band played inspiring music
during the evening.
A manly tribute was rendered to the
soldiers of the Revolution, of the war
of 1312, the Mexican war- and to those
who served in the great Civil War for
the preservation of the Union, and to
the men who fought in the recent war
with Spain. In closing General "Wood
ruff said:
Fellow citizens, I have tried to prove that
but fcr the sturdy pluck and steadfast en
durance of our soldiers in the revolution, the
Declaration of Independence would have passed
into history as the sentimental longings of
Impracticable philosophers and our constitu
tion would never have been written: but for
grand victory, for humanity and good govern
ment wrought out by our soldiers In the re
bellion the union would have been dissolved,
the emancipation proclamation a useless piece
of rhetoric and the Impracticability of a re
publican form of government settled for gen
erations. If not forever; but for the valor, en
ergy and humanity of our soldiers In the Span
ish-American war. Cuba would still be In a
state of anarchy, the Philippines a source of
bloody chaos and ruin, and our Government
thf* scorn of civilization.
I have tried to fairly show the deep, tlw
unfathomable dÂ«bt of gratitude our country
owes to the American soldiers and sailors, for
their great part In establishing, preserving and
enlarging our republic and placing ner In ths
front rank of the civilized nations of the
globe. \
The existence'' of republics depends upon love
of country and Americans should Inculcate It
in order that when the time comes, as It does
come in the life.- of. every nation, when thÂ» art
of the statesman is powerless, when philosophy
is in <VÂ»uht. when poetry only breathes to twin*
for r^triQtisnt " her fairest laurels, there shall
exist witliin the minds of all that love for our
union which -will save It when with right on
Us sid* the debate Is closed, the god of war
invoked and the arbitration transferred from
the national capital to the field of battle.
We are Americans, all, and we meet on this
one hundred and twenty-eighth birthday of
our nation to testify our belief In the form of
government which our forerathers founded:
our love for a country that nas bestowed Â«o
many blessings upon mankind; our loyalty to
and patriotic jirlde in a union, around which
cluster tender memories of neroes. comrades,
friends and kindred who died In its defense,

In the course of his address General
"Woodruff eloquently reviewed |he pro
gress of the country since the Declara
tion of Independence, and asked for a
pledge, in the words of the immortal
Lincoln, "that, under God, this nation
shall not perish from the earth."
"We Americans," the speaker said,
"are a strange people. "While posing as
devotees of r>eace we owe much to war,
and while never ready are always will
ing for war. And yet, while we owe
more to the soldier than to any other
class, we don't like an army."
He continued:
PATRIOTISM THE IDEAL.
Upon the stage were distinguished
visitors, Including General S. W. Back
us, president of the board of directors
of the home, and Directors Hugh M.
Burke and Colonel J. C. Currier. Col
onel George W. "Walls, commandant of
the home, introduced the participants
in the programme with a few well
chosen words. The soprano of Miss
Millie Flynn and the contralto of Miss
Ella McCloskey added greatly to the
pleasure of the day's exercises. After
the "Star-Spangled Banner" they
pleased the veterans by singing a num
ber of the latter's old favorites and re
sponded graciously to the applause
which greeted each song.
The Declaration oflndependence was
well read by Mrs. Ray Dennison Clark.
Patriotic airs were rendered by the
Veterans' Home Orchestra. General
Charles Woodruff stirred the audience
with an unusually fine oration.
Throughout his discourse he was in
terrupted many times by the enthusi
astic applause of his hearers. In part
he said:

DR. PIERCE'S REMEDIES.
i^Jr HaM tilt Swrtt af lift aaa Death. "^^1
Recent experiments condncted by most
eminent scientists, prove that light is a
great remedial agent; it is essentially
Nature's agent. It may be either sun-
light or electric light, but it has a de-
cided effect in helping nature to banish
disease and restore health. Other scien-
tific men have proved that oxygen elec-
trifies the heart and can prolong life.
The people on this earth are susceptible
to some laws which gorern plant life. A.
plant cannot be successfully grown in the
dark, j A man is seldom healthy and strong
who lives in the dark or in sunless rooms.
After all, Nature's ways are found to be
the best Nature's remedies are always
best for eradicating: disease, and by this we
mean a medicir.e made of roots and heTbs.
They arc assimilated in the stomach and
taken cp by the blood and are, therefore
the most potent means which can be em-
ployed for the rejaininjr of lost health.
Dr. R. V. Pierce, consulting physician to
1 ? C T, I ff! lld Â£ ?, ote - 1 and Surgical Institute,
at Buffalo, N. Y., in many years of exten-
sive practice, found that he could pin his
laith to an alterative extract of certain
nlants and roots for the cure of all bffod
diseases. This he called Dr. Picrce's
golden Medical Discovery. Containing no
alcohol nor narcotics, entirely vegetable,
this Â« Discovery Â» makes rich red blood and
55 a powerful tissue-builder, glvin? the tired
business man or woman renewed strength
and health. Rapidly jrrowing school-sjirls
and boys often show impoverished blood
by the pimples or boils which appear on
face or neck. To eradicate the poisons
, trotn the blood, and feed the heart, lunffs
i and stomach on pure blood, nothing is
so good as Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical
Discovery. ,
. Don't allow the dealer to insnlt your h>
-enigence by offering his own blood rem.
cay to yon instead of this well- known
preparation of Dr. Pierce's. Ten chancel
to one he will substitute a cheap compound

of July Oration at Oakland.
OAKLAND, July 4.â In a speech that
was a wide departure from the stilted
"Fourth of July" oration, former Con
gressman Julius Kahn of San Fran
cisco held the center of the stage this
afternoon at the literary exercises at
the Macdonough Theater. Kahn's ad
dress was a protest against what he
called an attempt to stir up wrath,
hatrsd, strife and contention among
the toiling masses under the guise of
so-called patriotism. So' vigorously
did the former Representative de
nounce demagogues and agitators that
he aroused hisa"udience to a high pitch
of enthusiasm. Kahn's oration was
one of the events of. Oakland's Fourth
of July programme.
; The "red, white and blue" was used
artistically in the stage embellish
ments, among which were conspicuous
flag-draped pictures of Washington
and Lincoln.

that Oakland set may be Imitated all
over the country.
Hereafter every town that owns one
of these captured Spanish cannon will
have to guard It well, for the example
OAKLAND, Julv 4. â There was one
feature of the Oakland celebration of
the national holiday that was abso
lutely unique â the old bronze Spanish
cannon that has decorated the City
Hall Plara for several years awoke
from its long-time sleep and its deep,
muffled voice opened the anniversary
of the nation that caused so much trou
ble for Spain. But when the old can
non spoke, after its many years of,si
lence, it did the best it could to injure
Us surroundings and it is estimated
that there was more than a thousand
dollars' worth of damage done to win
dows alone, without reference to dam
aged stocks of goods in nearby stores.
Shortly after Admiral Dewey cap
tured Manila there was a sudden de
mand for captured cannon, and
through the efforts of Congressman
"Metcalf a particularly fine specimen of
the old bronze pieces that had acted
as the defenses of Manila for years
was brought to Oakland and set up
in the City Hall park. The old can
non was mounted and for ab- *i lour
years has stood there, with a little tin
sign tacked upon the wooden carriage,
announcing that it was captured at
the battle of Manila Bay by Admiral
Dewey.
Of late years the hurrying tide of
American enterprise, swept by the old
piece and little heed has been given td
it: but some of th*e effervescent youth
of Oakland saw in the old gun a chance
to "do sturUs" that would awaken the
echoes of to-day. The piece had been
spiked in anticipation of just such ef
forts as the one that was so success
fully carried out. but this was not
a bar to making it speak once again.
A Ions piece of waterproof fuse was
run down the mouth of the cannon
and twenty pounds of black powder
poured in.' In the muzzle of the gun
was fitted a wooden plug nnd at 3:45
this morning the whole thing was
lighted. .
The- explosion was terrific, and win
dov.'s were broken for blocks around.
In the Pelger block, across the street,
not a window was left intact The

The fire destroyed a single-story busi
ne.es building on Dwight way near
Shattuek avenue, owned by Mrs. C. A.
Whiting. The loss is estimated by
Fire Chief Kenny at 54000. The store
keepers %yho were burned out are B. C.
Cook, grocer: L. W. Smitten, painter;
H. A. Pavliger. tailor. R. H. Bosworth
lost his household effects. The fire is
f uppesed to have been caused by a sky
rocket.
By retaining her presence of mind in
& moment of great danger Mrs. H. A.
Pavliger saved her three children this
morning from being burned to death in
a naming building on Dwight way.
The mother's* action was not a moment
too soon, for Fhe had no more than es
caped from the building with one child
in her arms and another trailing at her
night dress than the burning roof and
walls came down with a crash.
Mrs. Pavliger'* heroism was exhibit
ed Just after 4 o'clock this morning
when she was awakened by A. S.
BÂ«st, a. neighbor, wha shouted- that the
place wag on flre. Her children were
sleeping in different rooms so that she
could not get them quickly. By the
time she did reach them and throw
blankets around them the rtaraes had
enveloped the building and almost cut
off escape- There remained only the
rear door then from which to issue
safely and through this Mrs. Pavliger
rushed, regardless of the tongues of
flre that licked her dress. One of the
children was old enough to find Its own
way out. but she was incumbered by
the other two, of whom she dragged
one and carried the other along with
her. The very moment she got past
the flames there was a great crash of
timbers, which certainly would have
destroyed the family but for the brav
ery of the mother.
There was another heroic feature at
this fire. It was the courage of a
blind man who turned fireman. The
man's name Is H. V. Hull and when
firemen were needed he was there to
help. It that the fire depart
ment was late in responding to the
alarm and as there were only two men
to pull the Alert hose cart, two blocks
away from the scene of the flre Hull
was pressed into service. He was led
to the cart and stationed behind it so
that he could push, while the others
pulied and guided the machine. Thus,
through Hull's aid. a hose was turned
on the fire much sooner tb.an otherwise
it could have been. .

YOUNG AMERICA FAILS TO
BURN UP MUCH PROPERTY
Belle and Lotta Tobin, who present
a- refined and dainty musical act, were
heartily applauded afboth perform
ances at the Chutes yesterday. Carl
Reiter, a monologist, held his audi
ence laughing for full fifteen minutes,
and the three sisters Kelcey gave a
capital singing and dancing act.
Hershal Stein, a young barytone, made
liis first appearance as a singer of
illustrated songs, and Fyne and Dandy,
comedy acrobats; Trask and Rogers',
Mack-face comedians, and the anl
matoseope completed a capital pro
gramme.
The Central Theater began the week
yesterday with packed houses at both
matinee and evening performances of
Theodore Kremer's new play. "Wedded
ar.d Parted." It is a comedy drama
and, like all of Kremer's work, is as
full of sensations as an egg is of meat
Three or four curtain calls after every
scene proved that the Central has
etruck the real thing in the bill now
on the boards. The play tells the story
cf a woman's cruel wrongs, but the
faithful heart triumphs at last, of
course, and the day of happiness
dawns brightly after the night of woe
and suffering. The plot is said to have
been obtained from actual facts, re
vealed by the police records of New
York City. However that may be, the
piece is a pronounced success at the
Central and is in for a prosperous
track.
. Karl Mathieson, the Danish sailor
who assumed command of the boat
brought to Grimsby, only joined the
Norge at Copenhagen just before she
sailed for New York. He, said he
knew nothing about the , ship's ar
rangements in case of collision or fire.
He had nevervbeen instructed in the
fire drill and did not understand what
it meant. He was on' deck when the
vessel -struck., but he ; did not. know
until he heard the captain shouting
the order to man the boats that the
damage was great. Mathieson said:
"I worked with the third -mate and
followed him to the different boats.
The first we attempted to lower
fouled her, tackle, keeping her . stern
fixed, while her bows fell and shot the
HEAVY SEA RUNNING.
"We told the captain and he im
mediately told us to go ahead and we
picked them up. They were In a ter
rible plight. Men and women were in
sufficiently clothed and so cramped
that they could hardly come on board.
We could not start immediately, for
we had our nets out. but as soon as
they were stowed in we went di
rectly to where the Norge went down.
There, was no trace of the ship, but
back of the rocks were the bodies of
more than 100 men, women and HtUe
children."
"I went below and got the glasses.
" 'It's a small boat,' I said, 'and they
have got a jacket flying at the bow.'
" 'They have been shipwrecked.'
There were some biscuits, and these
were eaten by the shipwrecked people
during the ten hours between the time
the ship struck, at 7 o'clock a, m. June
28, until they were picked up by the
Grimsby trawler Silvia.
"And we who sat horror-stricken In
that small boat, avoiding as much as
possible the heavv seas because we
were afraid we would sink," said Larra
Christina Pederson of Copenhagen, who
Is on her way to join her cousin, John
Schroeder, at Chicago, "we were danc
ing and singing to the music of guitars
and violins the night before on the
promenade deck of the Norge. We
were so happy then in that small boat,
not knowing what would be our fate.
With the memory of horrible scenes on
the steamer, we could do nothing more
than pray miserably for the succor and
help that came."
"I was on the bridge looking at the
men gathering in the seine," said Hen
ry Glover, second engineer of the Silvia.
" 'Is that a buoy out of place?' I asked
the cook; who was with me on deck.
" 'You don't see any buoy,' he an
swered.. Â¦
plunged forward/her stern shot up in
the air and she -disappeared. The swim
mers In the vicinity of the ship were
drawn into the vortex and were whirled
around like chips in the maelstrom.
But twelve minutes elapsed from the
time the ship struck until she sank. A
fine Scotch mist which was falling at
the time shut out the other survivors
from the view of those who were
brought to GYimsby. These latter, as
soon as their boat was clear of the
scene of the wreck, devoted themselves
to thoughts of their own safety. A
jacket was tied to an oar, which was
in turn fastened to the bow of the boat,
and a sailor, a Dane, took charge of
the boat. Men and women were put to
work keeping the boat afloat, as a hole
had been stove in her bow when It was
lowered from the ship. An examination
of the water cask showed that It did
not contain a drop of water.
BUT L.ITTLJE TO EAT. .
, The crew , of ; the Norge appear to
have behaved well after the first panic,
when It' Is said, the officers were com
pelled to drive them back from the
boats. But there apparently was no
discipline, the orders which the captain
shouted from the bridge being,misin
terpreted or unheard. So far as the
survivors here remember there was no
systematic distribution of the people
to the boats, which, were not adequate
ly-manned. No attempt , was made by
any of , the . survivors to , save prop
erty. There /was no time to make prep
arations. . . â¢ . . . , . . "
Many deeds of. heroism shine bright
ly through the pall of the catastrophe.
That of Jans Peters Jansen, whoÂ«has
relatives in Brooklyn, N. Y., is told
with admiration by the survivors. He
was one of the engineers on the Norge.
When the ship struck ; he learned the
extent of the disaster and went below
to where his relatives were and told
them and those near by to go at once
to the upper deck. He" accompanied
them to the boats-and saw them safely
on board. He was urged to Join them,
but said he must return to the engine
room, and, shouting farewell, ran to
his post of duty, where he died. Some
of the male passengers, without a
thought of self,> placed women and
children In the boats, preferring to re
main behind rather than take advan
tage of their strength. The mate of the
Norge, who- left the ship, in the boat
which arrived j here, leaped Into the
water for the purpose of swimming to
a second boat. He had, only gone a
short distance when, weighted by his
clothes, his strength gave out and he
sank. ' .. '..'

Some of the crew were worse than the
passengers and but few of the officers
would have put off in the boats them
selves. They were driven back and
threatened with death unless they
obeyed orders. The captain never left
the bridge, but he shouted so many
orders that the crew did not know
what to do. Therefore, I stuck to the
third mate. Together we Jumped into
a small boat just before the vessel
went down, but we did not think so
many were left behind as appeared on
the water when the Norge sank. Those
remaining on board were chiefly
women and children. I saw only two
other boats afloat, one a big lifeboat,
easily carrying sixty persons, and the
other a smaller boat, carrying possibly
forty. No other bpats got away,
though there were eight on board."

breeze .from the southwest. I stood on
-the bridge with Chief. Officer Carpen
ter. Soundings were taken and it was
reported there was five feet of water
In the forward hold! Orders were given
to commence pumping and also to the
passengers to put on life belts and be
ready to get to the boats, which were
ordered to be put out.
"The crew worked nobly under the
leadership of the chief officer. Seven
boats got safely away, the life saver3
were cut adrift and the steamer went
down by the bow. The chief officer
told me she was sinking and I told him
to Jump overboard, which he did. I
did not see him again. I went down
with the steamer. My right leg got
jammed between two stanchions and
was very much injured. When I
reached the surface I noticed a num
ber of bodies floating. The Norge was
afloat only about twenty minutes after
striking.
"I swam for about twenty minutes
and came across Second Engineer
Brown, who Is a good swimmer. We
kept company for about an hour and a
half,* when we noticed a boat some dis
tance off and we both made for It. I
was hindered by my sore leg and the
engineer reached the boat first. Both
of us were taken on board exhausted.
We found that It was lifeboat No. 1.
It was crowded and under the charge
of Seaman Peter Olsen. After talking
a little, I took charge of the boat and
provisions, which consisted only of a
box with bread and two flasks of water.
The boat w^s steered for St. Kilda, 150
miles distant.
"On Saturday morning we saw a
large schooner-rigged . steamer about
four miles distant. We put up a
blanket on an oar, but the steamer
passed on without taking any notice
of us! On Sunday morning a boat
passed some distance off. At about 12
o'clock Sunday land was sighted and
the spirits of all were revived. It
proved to be St. Kilda. Some time aft
erward a steamer was noticed coming
from the west bearing down on our
boat. She proved to be the Energle,
and at 6 o'clock we were safe on
board." -
i ample. Still another jumped into the
water and soon around the ship hun
dreds of persons were struggling In the
sea. Others determined to stand' by
the ship, hoping against hope that she
would remain afloat.. Three boats, it
is known, successfully reached the sea.
The passengers frantically pulled away
,from the doomed ship, passing by poor
wretches who were still afloat and who
vainly begged to be taken aboard,
while from the ship came long, de
spairing cries. The women in the boat
which reached Grimsby hid their eyes,

the side of the ship. The occupants of
the boat who were not killed by the
impact were thrown Into the water.
The crew and passengers on deck had
no time to spare to assist the few who
had a chance to escape but lost- it.
Undeterred by the experience of the
first boat, a second, loaded principally
with women and children, was lowered.
This time the tackle ran smoothly, but

I others were supplicating aid from any
j one and shrieking for permission to
enter the boats, elbowing and fighting
their way to the places from which the
boats were being lowered. The -sound
of grinding ceased and the bow of the
Norge gnawed as the steamer returned
to deep water. The sea hungrily rushed
into the huge rents made by the rocks
in the iron hull. Swiftly the vessel
began to sink by the bow. Without
waiting for orders and without paying
attention to their proper manning the
1 occupants began to lower the boats.
1 The starboard lifeboat began slowly
lowering, when to the horror of those
on board the stern tackle failed while
the bow tackle ran free.
Soon the boat was almost perpen

found that water Was pouring into her

as the clanging bells brought the en
gines to a stop. Those of the pas
sengers who were standing at the time
the steamer struck the rock were
thrown against the bulkheads or on
the decks and had not recovered their
feet when a stentorian voice gave the
terrifying order: "All hands on deck;
hurry or you may sink."
Immediately there was a rush for the
narrow companiohways and men, wo
men and children pushes and struggled
and made every effort to reach the
dÂ«-.ck, where the boats swung from the
davits. Many persons who retained
their presence of mind seized life pre

that the strings were rotten and they
could not be quickly placed around

Teach Children to Swim.
Gibbs came down from his tree cured
of the sprain, picked up his camera
and went home. Then he developed
the photograph which the grizzly had
taken of Itself with the last shot he
had reserved for himself. .
Bert Gibbs is the amateur .photog
rapher bear hunter of all Hound Val
ley. But he doesn't hunt that class
of subjects since a big Mendocino
grizzly took his camera away from
him. He had shot everything in his
neighborhood and to his prized collec
tion of snaps of living birds, squirrels
and deer he longed to add the photo
graph of a live" bear. Qne with a
fierce, whiskered phiz, with tongue
lolling out and eyes gleaming in all
the savage fire of lowest brutedotn.
He was brave, was Bert, and filled
with .the enthusiasm of the true
"fiend,", took his solitary way into the
far woods armed with his loaded pic
ture-box. While cautiously beating up
a huckleberry patch trying to flush his
bear he fell over a bank and badly
sprained an ankle. After lying all
night disabled where he had fallen he
concluded that he was doomed to re
main there till he starved to death.
He photographed in his mind his ema
ciated body found days hence and the
sad idea came to him to take a last
"shot" at himself. He had heard that
people in the last ditch always reserved
last shots for their personal uses. He
would do this and the faithful camera
would give up a farewell view vt him
taken while dying.
Then he fastened a string to the
shutter of the machine, placed it on a
log and was beginning to "look nat
ural" before it when a huge grizzly
lumbered out of the brush making
more noise than a fujlgrown avalanche.
Gibbs heaved himself in one mighty
spring. His ankle was disabled but he
found no- difficulty in getting up a

Club have set for themselves ha?
had justice done to it in such accounts
of the club as have been pent to the
Vnited States since its opening the
other day. Probably it has been stated
that The Lyceum starts with a larger
membership and a liner clubhouse
than any other woman's club in the
world, and no doubt a good deal has
been said regarding the striking
ly large number of distinguished
women â both in this country and the
United States â whom Mirs Constance
Smedley, the bright girl who conceived
the idea of the Lyceum Club, has suc
ceeded in interesting in the project.
The Lyceum i?, of course, open to
professional women of every nation
and aims to do for its members a lot
of services such as no social organiza
tion â whether made up of men or
women â ever has undertaken before;
but the scheme of the young authoress
who founded it goes a good deal far
ther than thai.
"My ideal." ,Â«aid Miss Smedley to
the writer the other day, "is a union
of intellectual women workers the
world over which will advance the in
terests of all of them. That the Ly
ceum Club starts and for the pres
ent has its chief headquarters in Lon
don is merely accidental â though we
hope to make our clubhouse here a
meeting ground for women workers of
every nationality, as well as a sort of
'clearing-house' for their work. Our
hope is to have, eventually, just as
pretentious quarters and equal facili
ties for aiding members in New York
and the other great capitals."
"A woman's trade union," some one
called the Lyceum in my. hearing a
few days ago, and that really sums it
ell up. When Miss Smedley's idea of
an international club for feminine
writers, artists, musicians and other
intellectual workers was first mooted
it attracted no end of attention and
no sooner was it known that Lady
Frances Balfour, the Prime Minister's
sister-in-law, had become its chair
man, and Mrs. Moberly Dell, wife of
the editor of the Time?, its vice chair
man, and that half of the intellectual
women in this country, including Mrs.
Thomas Hardy, Mrs. Craigie, Miss
Beatrice Harraden, Mrs. Humphrey
Ward and Mrs. Flora Annie Steel, were
in the club's provisional committee,
applications for membership came in
almost aa fast as they could be record
ed. No small- number of them came
from the United States, and every
other civilized country in the world,
including China, was represented, too.
At the outset it had been decided
that the essential qualification for
membership In this club should be
active work for pay on the part of'an
applicant, the idea being to exclude
fashionable amateurs and beginners
who had fo far shown no special prom
ise, and this rule has been adhered to,
with the result that over 30 per cent of
:l:cse applying weie rejected. The list of
members Includes the names of two
Duchesses, several Countesses and a
few Ladies, it is true, but each of them
is an actual woman, worker. For In

The "medieval- torture chamber still
exists, if we may judge from the re
ports as to the "sweat box" and the
"third degree." What the concealed in
famy of the last may be is difllcult to
learn. The "sweat box" is a method
of confining suspects in heated air un
til the torture becomes so irritating as
to elicit almost any confession desired,
especially when coupled with cunning
questions and probings of the prose
cutors. But where is the boasted trial
by Jury and by hla fellows of. the An
glo-Saxon love of justice? It has been
supposed, wrongly, it seems, that a
man is held to be innocent until his
crime has been proved by orderly and
just trial. Punishment should not
therefore begin until after conviction.
The poor degenerates at best are poor
matches for the subtle and astute ques
tioners, without the added perplexity
resulting from torture. Why not revive
the rack and Â«crew and be done with
them Quicker and without trial? Will
some one tell the simple truth about
the abuses of the so-called examina
tions of prisoners before trial? What
exactly is the proceeding in the "third
degree" torture business? By what lavw
are such things allowed, and what have
the Judges and lawyers been about to
permit such barbaric anachronisms in
the twentieth century?â American Med

cars, caused by those who chartered them using them
'as Storage warehouses by not. promptly unloading them
when they arrived at their destination/ This detention
on railroads cast of the Missouri River averaged eight
days, and, west of that line five days, per car.
While a shipper was using a car standing for storage
that he paid nothing for, another shipper was waiting for
the car to carry his goods, and was subject to loss by the
unjust detention of the facility he desired to use. The
effect extended to the whole commerce of the country.
The railroads had a car auditing system by which the
location of every freight car in the United States was
known. every day, and also the use to which.it was being
put and the cause of its detention, if any. By a clearing
house system all the railroads adjusted their accounts
with each other for the use of their cars, but this did not
prevent the abuse of their charter by the private ship
pers who. used the" cars for stationary storage. Finally,
sixteen years ago.^the Car Service Association was or
ganized, representing all of the railroads in the country,
to enforce uniform regulations for the unloading and
use of cars by shippers. '.
The; cars handled, at the beginning of the work of the
association numbered 600,000 a, year. Now it is 1,828,
045, and the time of detention, has declined to about a
day'and a half.. In 1903 the association handled a total
of 29,634,020 cars. If these cars had been detained by
shippers for storage purposes an average of five days,
there would have been a loss in use of 143,120,140 days,
which would have fallen not only upon the railroads but
upon the commercial community. As a matter of fact
the detention amounted to only 48,391,494 days, thus
effecting a saving of time in the use of 29,634,020 cars
of 94,778,606 car days over the old system.
This has been effected by imposing a chargc-of $1 per
day for the detention of cars after the expiration of
forty-eight houFS. The car; now move more promptly
and the facilities of* the service have been improved by
this greater mobility. Perhaps the community would not
have known of this increase in facilities which it has en
joyed except for a suit that is just entered against the
Car Service Association by the Coal Shippers' Associa
tion of Chicago to have it declared illegal and a trust
in restraint of trade. The coal shippers are interested in
warehousing on the track. If they can hold loaded cars
an average, of eight days they save storage. In the ag
gregate that means an enormous sum to the coal ship
pers, but as they do not pass the benefit on to their cus
tomers the public would suffer from a blockade of trans
portation facilities, with no corresponding benefit.
As the time saved last year amounted to, the service
of .315.928 cars. for each of the 300 working days of the
year, .it will be seen that a return to the old detention
system would mean the withdrawal of that .many cars
from service entirely. This would cause a car famine of
Mich proportions as would inflict great injury upon the
commerce, of the country.
The Coal Shippers' Association, in its averments in
the case, says that the power to. force the mobility of
freight cars by imposing a detention charge of $1 per. day
may be used in serious restraint of trade, and therefore
is obnoxious 1 to the anti-trust law; It is not plain that
the power to impose such a charge is in restraint of
trade. Freight car>-are. chartered for transportation, not
storage. Unles? there is some way to procure their
prompt unloading and return to the rolling service, the
shipper can retain them indefinitely for warehouse pur
pose?, subjecting their owners arid .the' public to great
losses and inconvenience. A court of equity would prob
ably say that the detention of cars is such a restraint of
trade as to warrant the means used to prevent it and Â«i
court of law might well hold that what the Car Service
Association does should be embodied in the interstate
commerce law. If it be held that such service is ob
noxious to the- anti-trust law, that statute should 1 be
amended in that particular. 0'/>x
.The .organization of the Car Service Association, now
perhaps for the first time known to trie general public,
illustrates the development of our American railway
system, and" its attempted impeachment in the courts
shows how* closely law follows everything done or left
undone in our vast system of . transportation. It may
have its defects, but if the. country were compelled to
resort to the crude methods it has displaced the result
would he ruin and famine for millions of people.
THE. commercial and non-commercial public goes

veniences .alike, quite thoughtless of the progress

It seems doubtful if the really
rather high ideal ' which the
founders of the new Lyceum
Wftv London I.adity' Clubf
thought he might secure the papers in
which Bismarck had told the real
story of the birth of the German em
pire â that strange story of craft and
heroism, littleness and grandeur. It
was on this mission that I sailed for
Hamburg. I had two letters for Bis
marck. One was from a negligible
Embnssador. The other had been
given me by a German statesman of
some note, with whom. In other days.
I had been a, student in the University
of Jena. My friend had been a fa
miliar of Bismarck's household and
bespoke me a kindly hearing. I sent
the letters on from Hamburg arid fol
lowed the next day. .Â¦-:;*-
On the table at his elbow, as he
sat by the window, I noticed my let
ters.- The valet who had placed a
chair for me took his stand by the
door. I said what I had to say. It
was (permit me to affirm it!) an ad
mirable speech. For ten days and
nights I had rehearsed it as, I paced
the deck of the stormy liner; so â -In
tolerable German â I declaimed It. Tt
was dignified; It waa diplomatic.
When I had finished Bismarck took
the pipe from his lips, said "Neln"â
and put the pipe back again.
'Twas the shortest answer I ever
had in my life. I waited for a mo
ment. The old man smoked and stared
out into the park. I got up and bowed;
I had rehearsed that bov and did not
intend to waste it; I bowed to hl3 old
hairless head â the flabby yellow Jowls
and big mustache â to the old gray
jacket and the pipe. It was like
salaaming to a stone wall. Then the
valet led me out. In the park I re
gained my senses. â Success.

tained that she was rather ignorant of
the purpose of." her mission.
"Ay. bane told I must get a license

know not what that manes."

Simpson, "you see, you must secure a

There' are thousands of pcVsoris in the. United'States
whose stocks; declined anywhere from 25 to 73 per cent
during that long, slow shrinkage, and large indeed must
be the bank account that can stand such a drain and
leave its possessor solvent Many fortunes were, swept
away altogether, and everybody, professional or out
sider, who had money invested in Wall street, lost. Un
der such circumstances some time must necessarily
elapse ere sufficient recuperation is gained for further
investment, and even then the purchase of securities will
be slow and cautious. This is probably the reason why
Wall street stocks, while .showing a buoyant undertone,
do not-advance, though everybody says they ought to,
and is surprised that they do not.
Similar conditions prevail in Europe. A New York
banker, lately returned from abroad, says:
"Money is very plentiful in Europe, and ratios are ac
cordingly low. The situation there is very much the
same as here. There is a very noticeable" tendency
among foreign investors to choose short-term securities
in preference to the standard long-term investments.
Among the leading English bankers there is more op
timism on American securities than there is- among our
own bankers. I do not think, though, that "they are' look
ing for an immediate rise in market. values."
The crop prospects, upon which, as already stated, the
condition of trade so largely depends this year, are not
as brilliant as they were a week or ten days ago, but they
are still excellent, apd plenty of wheat, corn and cotton
is assured. In Europe the wheat crop has suffered some
deterioration, owing to bad weather, but the world's sup
ply of this grain will probably be ample for all require
ment*. I
The provision market is in rather better condition
ngz'n, as the âccent liquidation has about ceased. Stocks
are still 'iberal at the leading packing centers, but there
is no congestion. There is nothing new worthy of note
in the r*\\til- industries, except that nothing more is
heard of growing depression in these lines, and there is
no mere closing down of mills and factories, though
some here and there are occasionally working shorter
hours. The. rai'road? are making no more staff reduc
tions, as*far as reported, ?nd those made some weeks ago
turn out to have been considc.rabjy exaggerated. Aside
f r om the redaction in the wage scale of the iron workers
at the beginning of the year, and which was then sup
posed to be the beginning of a general scaling down of
wages all over the country, there have been few wage
reductions affecting large bodies of men, and labor seems
to be well employed throughout the country.
The condition of trade-in San Francisco is pretty well
illustrated by the local Â¦ bank, /clearing's, which in June
v.ere $125,050,587. against $11 7494.342 in June, 1903. For
the first six months of the year they were $727,42 r, 345,
against Â§737,654.053 for.'the/same time, in .1903, The back
figures show that while we are still behind 1903 in these
local clearings, we regained some lost ground in June, for
on June 1 we were about $18,000,000 behind 1903, where
&E t \ve arc. row only about $10.900,000' behind. This ap
parently indicates some gain in local trade in June, for
the clearings in May were $119,208,296, or about .$6,000,
000 below those for the month /of June. 0 ,
This exhibit is confirmatory of the preceding state
ment that during the past several weeks business has
taken a turn for the better. As the improvement comes
during one cf the two dull periods of the year, it is doubly
reassuring, and presages a very good fall trade. Prices,
too, are. keeping up in spite of the depressing tendency
of all the. recent talk about "recession," "dull times," etc.,
and nobody seems to be worrying about the future!
As far as current indications go, therefore,- the outlook
for continued good times in the United States is excellent
and much better than during the first half of. the year..
In. financial circles at New York the feeling of'coitfi
dence in the future, so often mentioned of late, is as pro
nounced as ever. It is felt more by professionals than
the public, however, for the latter arc still indisposed to
purchase even standard dividcnd-payjmg stock's except
in a small and tentative way. Perhaps.- they -harve not
recovered ' from the enormous. losses of 1903 and the
early part of 1904 attendant upon the great liquidation in
railroad and industrial share?, for. as time pisÂ»es and the
facts, slowly. leak out it is seen "with incrc.ising.clearness
that the public Josses from the famous' shrinkage were
enormous. â¢ . . : ;
The failures for the week were 244, against 215 for the
same week in 190,3. The railway earnings, which during
the first half of the year ran steadily behind those for
the preceding year, have lately taken a turn foi the bet
ter, as already mentioned, and during the month of June
exhibited an increase of about 3 per cent, which is a
marked improvement over the 3 to "6 per cent loss of
the spring months. The failures, it will be seen, are more
numerous than during the corresponding period in 1003,
but the liabilities have steadily decreased, showing that
the failures as a rule are small. â¢ k 'â¢ Â¦
WHILE business is still quiet, the quietude is
due more to the usual midsummer lull than to
any intrinsic sluggishness, for the more favora
ble, conditions observed during ihe past fortnight still
continue. Indeed, the current signs are the best ' for,
some months, and the- impression that we areto have
improved conditions'during the last. half of the year, is
steadily increasing. It is.truc that the country's bank
clearings last week showed 1 a- loss of 20.8 per ce.nt'.-as
compared with the. corresponding week in 1904, with all
but two of the important cities â St. Louis and Cincinnati
â on the wrong 'side of the exhibit," but the week was
broken into by. 'the. .holidays, and the. figures for a holi
day week are apt to be misleading, at least on the sur-

Women painters who belong to the
Lyceum Club will be supplied with de
tailed information as to the standing
of different exhibitions throughout the
artistic world, the times during which
they are open -and- the chances- for
sales at .each. The club -will* handle
members' pictures in almost' the same
way as it will handle their manu
scripts; for instance, a painting by an
American member could be sent to the
Â«lub, which would keep it going from
exhibition to 'exhibition both in this
country and on the Continent until
sold. Similar arrangements wiik be
made for disposing of the work of
black and white artists. And, so far
as the feminine composers who be
come 'members of the club ure con
cerned, their work will be offered to
musical publishers, and concerts will
be arranged to introduce it. To all
these services members of . the Lyce
um Club will become entitled after
the payment of their subscription,
which, at the startout, Is $10 for Eng
lish and $5 for American and other
foreign members. The only charges
which the .club' will make to members
served through this Information, bu
reau will be for out of pocket ex
penses.
Of the Lyfeum â as a clubâ little
hag been said in this article, as I fan
cy, that the most interesting points
about it have been covered in the tel
egraphic dispatches. American women
workers who go abroad may bo inter
ested to hear, however, that the Ly
ceum contains fifty bedrooms, which
will be at the disposal of its foreign
members when in London at prices
which cannot be touched in the me
tropolis in point of reasonableness.
The catering at the Lyceum 'will be
another of its features. Foreign mem
bers who wish it will also be given
letters of introduction to assist them
to put in their time to the best ad
vantage, and they. - will. bJ welcomed
to the receptions which are to be
held frequently, with the *ldea of mak
ing the clubhouse, as its founder says,
"a common meeting ground for intel
lectual women workersv the' "world
over." , Among', the American, women
of prominence who "'.win make use of
the club this summer are Mrs. May
Wright Sewall, who . returned from
Berlin the other day with Miss Smed
ley, Miss Laura Gill, dean of Bar
nard College, and Miss Woolley, pres
ident of Mount Holyoke College.
The Lyceum Club has the advan
tage of being started in a businesslike
way. Capital to a practically unlim
ited extent is behind the enterprise
and the rent of the club premises at
128 Piccadilly, as wel las the working
expenses of the .organization, have
been guaranteed for sev;en years.
There is not space to enumerate the
details of all the functions that this
unique bureau of information will un
dertake, but they may be indicated
rapidly. With the assistance of the of
ficials of the British Museum and the
London Office of Records, a complete
list â¢ !s be'.ng made of archivists and
professional researchers all over the
world, ar.d It is the intention to get in
touch with each of them in order that
researches mar be undertaken on be
half of the scientific and university
members of the Lyceum Club, so that
in the fullness of time, as Miss Smed
ley expressed it to me the other day,
"it will be nearly as easy to make
references by proxy in the libraries of
Salamanca, Seville . or St. Petersburg
as in one's own study."
Probably the thing that American
women will ask about the Lyceum
Club, however, is in what way it is to
be of service to its members the world
over, who may never get to London to
be "put up" at the clubhouse in Picca
dilly. The best way to answer the ques
tion is to describe the "information bu
reau." which is the most Interesting
thing about the new club and tha,t
which makes it entirely different from
any similar institution the world over.
So far as the literary members of the
Lyceum Club are concerned, this bu
reau v.FIIdo the work of a gigantic
agency in placing their work. To be
gin with, a complete register will be
kept oi the names and. addresses of
editors and publishers throughout the'
world, together with particulars of the
class of work each accepts and as to
rates and times of payment. The stand
ing of literary agents everywhere will
be ascertained and recorded, too. But
it is as a'"ciearlner house" for the work
of writers that this bureau wllUbe of
the greatest service. With its aid, the
feminine writer of almost anv sort of
a story, -article, or what not. can have
it published â provided . it has .salable
qualities â practically ' the world over.
Supposing, for instance, an American
member of the club writes a story and
sends a copy of her manuscript to the
London headquarters. Once its quality
is fiStablished. it will only be a question
of in how many markets it can be sold.
One of the chief members of the staff
in each Continental depot of the Ly
ceum Club wiU be a translator, who
also knows thoroughly the literary field
in her country, and to these folk copies
of American and English stories, arti
cles, etc., will be sent for translation
and sale. In this way it is believed
that the production of, say, an Amer
ican writer, can be disposed of, not on
ly in her own country and in Great
Britain, but in a good many European
States, not to mention the English col
onies, where depots of the Lyceum Club
also are in process of establishment.
Payment for such stories or articles
will be collected by the representatives
of the Lyceum Club and sent to the
London headquarters to be forwarded
to the author.

So far bureaus of the Lyceum Club
have been ooened in Paris, "Berlin and
Prague. The American membership is
not yet sufficiently large to justify the
opening of a depof in New York, but
such an event seems not far off. At
present the interests of the Lyceum
are being looks! after directly by Mrs.
Florence Allen Degan of New York.
Some time ago the idea of the club was
submitted by Miss Smedley to promi
iient American women, and among
those who have consented to a,ct on
the American provisional committee
are Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett,
Mrs. Mary E. Wilkins Freeman, Miss
Jeanette L. Gilder, Mrs. Burton Har

General Federation of Women's Clubs.

We believe thrt nation will ever be. what
she ik now, the first nation of the world; first,
not because of her multitudinous sources of
wealth and power, her- broad stretches of
territory teeming with produce, her great,
sweeping, commerce-laden rivers, Â¦ her \ com
manding frontage upon the two great oceans
of the globe, or her rich, active metropolises;
not because of her dominating influence over
a great continent; nor her secure isolation; nor
ytt because of her victorious fleets fresh from
achievements that startled the world; nor her
mobile, patriotic army springing; spontaneously
at the note of danger from the farm, the work
shop, the foundry, the store, the professions
from ivery vocation ot the people, and return
ing with the i coming of . peace to ttve plain
duties of citizenship: first, not because. of all
thvse, but ftret among the powers of the earth
for her devotion to those principles which
marked and consecrated her birth, which pro
claimed her not only. a new nation but the
mother of a new civilization, and which pledged
her forever to the cause of human kind.
Â¦We shall not fcrgtt; nor shall we lose faith.
Â¦Whatever be the dangers that *sem to
threaten, though the cry of too zealous par
tisanship or the wall of bilious pessimism may
fill the air, though wealth point with alarm to
the agsrc*s!cns of tabor, and labor shout with
anger at the growth of capital, though -charge
and counter-charge be made and thÂ« whole
fabric of government seem to the nervous eye
to be toppling to destruction, the great, true
people of this land will ever bÂ«lleve in her
power to breast every peril and to solve every
difficulty. We believe in America. We billeve

led Banner." Conversation ceased and
the crowd maintained the silence of
deepest respect as those strains thnt
fire the blood of native and foreign
born alike rang clearly through the
hall. As the last triumphant notes
swelled and died away the building
shook with cheers. ,, The crowd would
not be quiet till Miss Rooney sang
"Columbia" for them.
Then. Father , Caraher. 1 introduced
Judge Frank Murasky, orator of the
day, and the audience listened gladly
to a SDeech that might well be num
bered among the masterpieces of Amer
ican eloquence. Following are some
extracts:
May the time never coined when vÂ» shall
make a commonplace and soulless observance
of this day; when the momentoifg declaration
which marked an epoch, not for the people of
this land alone, but for all the human race,
shall be forgotten; when the boldness, the no
bility of spirit, the inspired purpose*, the un
conquerable manhood of the signers of that
great charter of freedom, and the patriotism,
the sacrifice, the I heroism, the unfaltering;
courage of the first soldiers of liberty to battle
upon this continent shall be but sounding and
futile phrases, touching in no revlbrant chord,
arousing no enthusiasm, awakening no soul
moving impulses. May the day never come when
the sight of the star-spangled banner and the
sounds of the soul-stirring militant music that
cheered onr h*ro*Â« upon so many gory battle
fields shall have lost their power to move thÂ«
sensitive springs of our emotions. When the
eun shall rise upon a. Fourth of July without
its parades, its fireworks, its waving "flags, lta
beating drums and martial music, Jts patriotic
gatherings. Its universal JubtlatlonNt will set
upon the death scene of that Americanism
which had Its birth upon the lanes of Lexing
ton and the slopes of Bunker Hill.
North Beach was regaled with fire
works galore last night, the display
taking place in Washington Square.
There were cascades of flowing fire,
Skyrockets and variegated bulbs flying
from east to west and north to south.

ARY EXERCISES. .
The crowd of spectators along the
streets was thinner than usual, owing
to the fact that many people had taken
advantage of the double holiday to
enjoy an outing. But- the sightseers
in town saw a fine parade. From the
moment Colonel J. C. O'Connor gave
the order "Forward" the march w,as
like clock work. Fourteen bands
swelled the music of songs that will
never die: "Marching Through Geor
gia," "Rally 'Round the Flag," "Dixie,"
"Hail Columbia" and "Yankee Doodle."
Along the route small boys and big
The Independent Rifles in their gaudy

quaint uniforms they swung along with

There was the usual vociferous rec

in the crowd. Loud cries of "Hello,

mingled with mock advice, such as
"Cheese it for tha^t skate, Tim; he

Other set pieces included the "United
States coat of arms and an immense

The residents from the Mission and
many persons from adjoining districts
witnessed a brief but attractive display
at Eighteenth and Dolores streets.
While the effects of some of the bomb*
were spoiled by the fog, the set plece3
and other works not calculated to be
seen at a great distance showed, splen

At the Chutes, as usual on the
Fourth, a good display was made,
bombs, rockets, fountains and patri
otic set pieces pleasing the throng.
The memory of the Fourth of July
in '76 was very much alive yesterday
in San Francisco. Though thousands
of people had left town there was all
day long a firecracker pandemonium
big enough for three times the popula
tion, and at night "the rockets' red
glare, the bombs bursting in air" pene
trated a thick mist and multitudes
gazed on the pyrotechnic display.
Flags fluttered everywhere. \ It
seemed there were no colors in all the
world but the red, white and blue of
Old Glory.
And the bands! Their brazen notes
reached the remotest alleys cf the city.
Everybody heard at least a few bars
of "America" or "The Star-Spangled*
Banner" and was thrilled ' with the (
nation's annual burst of patriotism.
"May the time never come," said
Judge Frank Murasky in his oration
at the Alhambra Theater, "when we
shall make a commonplace and soul
less observation of this day; when the
momentous declaratic-n which marked
an eDoch not for the people of this
land alone, but for all the human race,
shall be jforgotten."
There was no need in San Francisco
for the Judge's prayer. The birthday
of the nation was as fittingly observed
here yesterday as it ever has been in
any city in the land.
. The Alhambra Theater was crowded
to the doors for the literary exercises
at 2:20 p. m., and the audience was
ready to cheer at every allusion to the
Stars and Stripes or to the Revolution
ary heroes.
In an impressive "manner Rev. W. M.
Bours opened the exercises with a sol
emn invocation, calling down a blessing
upon the nation, the State and the city.
The Rev. Father Caraher, president of
the meeting, told the purpose of the
gathering In words that started ap
plause and spoke warnlngly against
"entangling foreign alliances." "The
American eagle," concluded the father,
"fears no nation on earth."
"My Own United States," sung by
Charles E. Hay, was well received, and
Mrs. Grace D. Ohnimus' artistic recita
tion of Drake's "Address to the Flag"
caused a demand for more. As an en
core she recited "Victor Galbraith."
NATIONAL AIR REVERBERATES.

The police are inclined to accept the
plausible theory of accident, as Kidd
Fays he has no enemies. Some cele
brant of the national birthday may
have become reckless with the use of
a revolver and sent leaden missiles
Fpeedir.gr on the line of a thoroughfare.
An investigation, however, will_ be
made. Detectives Dlnan, Bunner and
Freel have been detailed ! by Captain
Martin for that purpose. The' fact that
the bullet had not been deflected from
the sidewalk or any other object in Its
passage is presumptive proof that the
revolver was pointed point blank at
Kidd when the shot was fired. The
range could not have been very great,
as is shown by the force with which
the bullet struck its victim, and the
circumstance of a man, unless intoxi
cated, using a bullet-loaded 44-caliber
pistol for celebration purposes is not
usual. For these reasons a thorough
inquiry will be held.
Kidd says he had just crossed Vallejo
street on Stockton when a pedestrian
remarked that there was blood on his
clothing. At the same time he became
conscious of a stinging sensation in the
left side of his body. While he stopped
to investigate the sidewalk beneath
him became red with gore. With a
friend, Ed Buckley, Kidd continued to
walk on and turned ur> Green street,
leaving a trail of blood In his wake.
After a short distance on the last
named street had been covered Kidd
found he could go no farther, and
dropped in a doorway.
Some pedestrian blew a police whistle
and Patrolmen Brodt and McManus re
sponded to the call. Kidd was sent to
the Central Emergency Hospital, where
Dr. Stephen found that the bullet had
passed through the body, puncturing
the lung, but missing the heart, and
lodged in the clothing on the back of
his body. Stephen says the injured man
has a possible chance of recovery,' but
it is feared that complications may de
velop to prevent this.
Arthur Oliver, a colored man, known
to the pugilistic world as "Kid" Oliver,
a member of the Bay City Athletic
Club, was fatally stabbed last night by
Frank O'Connor, a soldier In Company
H, Thirteenth Infantry, stationed at
the Presidio. Oliver was standing with
several other negroes at the corner of
Pacific and Stockton streets when two
infantrymen, Frank O'Connor and
James O'Xeil. passed by. Oliver is
said to have called the soldiers "cari
bou." At this they took offense. O'Con
nor advanced on Oliver and an alterca
tion followed. During the argument
O'Connor drew a clasp knife and made
two passes at the colored man. The
second blow plunged the knife into
Oliver's abdomen.
The negro was removed to the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital, where his
wound was pronounced fatal. O'Nell,
who had nothing to do with the affair,
has disappeared. O'Connor was taken
to the hospital by Detective O'Dea and
Â¦was identified by Oliver as the man
that stabbed him.
Powers Kidd, a pressman, 50 years of
age and living at 1S17 Stockton street,
was struck yestejday by a bullet fired
from a revolver in the hands of an un
known person. The chances for his
recovery are doubtful. The mysterious
shooting took place on Stockton street,
between Vallejo and Green, about 5
o'clock in the evening, the bullet of 44
caliber entering Kidd's left breast
and passing entirely through his body.
The injured man declares he did not
know he had been shot until a passer
by called his attention to blood on his
vest. A few moments later he sank in
a weakened condition to the sidewalk.

"Dear Mrs. Pikkhau : â Your med-
icine is indeed an ideal woman's medi-
cine, and. by far the best I know to
restore lost, health and strength- I
suffered misery for several years, being
troubled with menorrhagia. My back
ached, I had bearing-do'vm pains and
frequent headaches, . I would often
wake from restful sleep, and in such
pain that I suffered for hours before I
could go to sleep again. I dreaded the
long nights as much as the weary days.
I consulted two different physicians,
hoping to get relief, but, finding that
their medicine did not seem to cure me.'
I tried your" Yegetable Compound
on the recommendation ' of a â¢ friend
from the East who was visiting me.
.: "lam glad that I followed her ad-
vice, for every ache and pain* is gone,
and not only this, but my general
health is much improved. I have a
tine appetite and have gained in flesh.
My. earnest advice to ' suffering women
is to put aside all other medicines and
to take Liydia E. Pinktaam's Vege-

the inside station, Keegan was in the
"center ana Nelson on the outside, near
the bank of the lake. Almost from the
start Sherry- steered I wildly, taking
Keegan's water and shortly afterward
Nelson's, though he escaped fouling
either of them. After the turn Sherry
wandered all over the course, but fin
ished first, Nelson being . second and
Keegan third. Time, 9:18%. .
The race for the junior barge cham
pionship brought out four competitors,

SHERRY STEEIIS' WILDLY.
The Alameda- Boat Club carried off
the honc-rs at the annual championship
rowing regatta held yesterday on Lake
Merritt, winning the three barge races
and one of the outrigged skiff events.
The only first prize not won by an
Alameda crew or single sculler was the
junior outrigged skiff race, in which
F. J. Sherry of the Dolphin Boat Club
came In first. Al Kihn, assistant mar
shal of the course and a member of
the Alameda Boat Club, filed a protest
against Sherry on the ground that he
Impeded the of the other com
petitors. No' decision was rendered.
The matter will be referred to the
board of managers of the Pacific Asso
ciation of the Amateur Athletic Union.
The weather at Oakland yesterday
was delightful, a light breeze just
ruffling the surface of the lake. .The
shores and boathouses were crowded
with spectators and many small row
boats and sailboats went to and fro on
the water. The first race was started
at 2:30 p. m. and thereafter the eventa
proceeded regularly, so that the pro
gramme was finished at 4:30 p. m.
The officials of the day were T. J.
Kennedy, of the Dolphins, referee:
Leander Stevenson, starter; Frank
Browning, George James and J. B.
Keenan. timers; marshal of the course,
Robert .Me Arthur; assistant marshals,
W. T. Howe and Al Kihn: Judges at
the finish, N. A. Denvir, J. ,T. . Sullivan.
C. M. Farrell and George Tupper;
judges at the turn, A. C. Du Fosse, W.
H. MÂ«ad, J. Lewis arid W. O. Patch.
The regatta was In. charge" of the? re
gatta committee of the Pacific "Athletic
Association. Â¦
During the interval between the tbjrd
and fourth races Dr. F. W. Riehl was
to have given - a life saving exhibition
by the aid of, kites, but, the wind not
being strong enough, the. attempt was
abandoned. Many Japanese . daylight
fireworks - ware ' sent ; up P and > â¢ proved
highly^, entertaining. .;'.?>; /
OFFICIALS OF THE DAY.
..Both Alameda crews rowed the same
rapid stroke, starting off and finishing
at about fifty strokes to the minute.
They had the advantage of rowing in a
beautiful new barge built by Al .Rog
ers. It is almost as light as: a shell.
In the race for the senior outrigged
skiff championship Charles Wilson of
the Ariel Rowing Club took the place
of A. W. Pape of the Dolphin Boating
Club, E. B. Thorning of the Alameda
Boat. Club being his opponent, Thorn
jng was first to the turn. He took so
wild a course on the home stretch that
Wilson might have beaten him easily
had he kept reasonably straight, but
he followed Thorning and was beaten
by several lengths. Time. 8:4S^4.
In the senior four-oared barge race
the Alameda and Dolphin crews start
ed from one" side of the Judges' plat
form and the South. Ends from the
other. The Alamedas were first to turn
the stakes, the Dolphins second and the
South Ends third. The Alamedas won
as they liked, the Dolphins' finishing
second and the South Ends last. Time.
7:55. The winning Alameda crew was
the same as that which won the cham
pionship in the intermediate class. The
Dolphin crew was the same as thai;
which rowed in the same rac^ In the
South End crew George Collopy was

Hanlon on his return from the East.
The popular little boxer arrived about
8 o'clock and was met at the ferry
by Morris Levy, M. Sullivan. Billy Jor
dan, Billy Roach and a host of others.
So many were there that. Eddie was
quite unnerved. Before he could re
cover he was presented with a huge
floral piece, while the Native Sons'
band of the California Parlor played
strains such as might greet a return
ing warrior. Eddie was escorted with
pomp and fireworks to his home and
family by his cheering friends. H9
was in tip top health and says he had
the time of his life.

Hearther of the Oaklands met with an

Special Dispatch to The CalL |
TACOMA. July 4-â Tacoma took the
doubleheader to-day from the San
Francisco team, to whom they tried
to present the morning contest by
erring at critical moments. However,
the home players batted Yerkes in the J
eighth and secured four runs more than
enough to win the game. St. Vrain
pitched well, but was poorly supported.
In the afternoon Keefe was in fine
form for seven innings. In the last
two rounds he became weak and gave
raany bases on balls, which were re
sponsible for the two runs of the vis
itors. Kecfe was relieved by Thomas,
uho finished the game. Eagan brought
in the first runs for the Tigers with
a home run hit over the left field fence
with tv.o men on bases. Jones was hit
frequently and his support was dis
couraging. Reitz and Casey did some [
epectacular work in the diamond, while
McLaughlin, Hildebrand and Waldron I
were the star outfielders. In the fourth
Waldron made a perfect return of Ea
pan's drive to deep center, retiring
JCordyke at third base. Scores:

Billy Miller, a new one and unat
tached, took the place of Tony Ford,
scheduled to go against Joe Larkin of
the Belmont Club. Larkin, according
to the announcer, weighed 13S pounds,
but he did not look the part. Perhaps
he appeared so big because Miller was
so small, but against clever boxing the
evident superiority In weight told in
the second round, when Miller went
out.
Ed Johnson of the Hartford Club
showed a willingness to do his best with
"Chiefy" Johnson, another "pride of the
Mission." Edward used a right shift
in the beginning and looked promising.
In the third, however, when the little
fellows worked their arms like a Spring
Valley windmill, the Mission wonder
got to the right place and the Hartford
man was carrfed to his corner.
The savins feature of the disappoint
ing afternoon was the go between Jack
McMullen of the Colma Club and Eddie-
Coyne, the "pride of the Mission." The
"pride" certainly had a .fall. In spite
of his crouch and spectacular footwork
Eddie met a youngster who had a right
and left behind his gloves and the abil
ity to land when and where most need
ed. While McMullen had clearly out
pointed Coyne up to the end of the al
lotted four rounds, the "pride" was
still strong on his leg?, and to prolong
the fun another round was demanded.
Then, of course, Referee Al Young gave
the decision where It belonged and
there was no objection.
The main contest wag advertised to
be between Jack Sullivan and George
Sulliva^n. heavy-weights. It was a long
way from being a star attraction, al
though a moment's excitement was
promised when both of the big fellows,
tired of wrestling, fell over the ropes.
In the first round Jack Sullivan danced
and waxed merry, and eleven suc
cessive times George put a caressing
right to the protruding point of Jack' 4
Jaw. There was nothing to cause slum
ber in the blows and Jack continued to
dance, using in the Infighting a four
inch jab which might have groggied a
feather-weight. The gong saved Jack
in the second, and in the third Deputy
Sheriff Carroll offered to end the agony
unless the Sullivans would drill. They
tried, but couldn't, and on the showing
the verdict went to George.
The first mixup on the card was be
tween William O'Brien and "William
Henry, and there was nothing doin.5
until the middle of the fourth round,
when Henry decided to take a nap for
ten seconds.
The battles of the Revolution, which
made the celebration of Independence
day possible, were not reproduced In
the fight pavilion at Colma yesterday.
About 500 made the long Journey, and
for their pains were treated to five
bloodless bouts, including two knock
outs, that contributed nothing; to the
enthusiasm. A- few courageous small
toys with a basket of firecrackers could
have wrought more entertainment for
the bloodthirsty and more real damage
to themselves.

possessor of the Wrenn-Spaulding cup,
he having won out two Â¦ successive
times After the preliminaries the gamÂ«j
narrowed down to a fight between

was no match for the San Mateo boy
and failed to take a single game.

BKK2IIT COLUMBIA WINS
MATCH AT IXGLES1DE PARK
In the afternoon MacGavin played
the best fame he has ever shown. He
was invincible at the net and in the
back court nothing seemed out of his
reach. His service was not particu
larly strong, but he followed it in and
usually won the point by a well-placed
volley.
Smith tried hard to stem the tide of
defeat and fought all the way, but
he was constantly on the defensive and
except for once in the second set was
always a game behind. The ex-cham
pion volleyed poorly and at times
when he needed a point either netted
or put the ball out. His service was
not as good as usual. The ball did not
twist much and lacked speed. Smith
was in rather poor condition, but aside
from this he was outplayed both at 1
the net and in the back court.
Although the match went to. Mac-
Gavin in straight sets, it was by no
means one-sided. All three sets went
to deuce and in all of them Smith
looked to have a chance. Twice he
pulled up from 5-3.to 5-5, only to lose
the next two games. In the second
set at 4-4 he had a lead of 30-0 Ion
the ninth game, but lost. it. In Ihe
third set, although tired, he pulled up
from 4-2 to 4-4 and again evened the
rcore at 5-5. The score in MacGavin's
favor was 7-5, "6-4, 7-5. ,â¢
In the morning Miss Hotchkiss had
a much easier time defeating Miss
Edwards thun was expected. . In the
first sot the ex-champion made a good
showing, but in the second Miss Hotch
kiss won as she pleased. The win
ner played a game that is second only
to that of the buttons. She played rtg
gres?ively at the net and in the back
court used a well-placed drive. The
score Â¦tfas 6-3, 6-1.
At the conclusion of the afternoon's
match prizes were awarded the win
ners as follows: First and challenge
cup. Miss Hotchkiss; second, Miss
Lulu Wegener; third, Miss Berry and
Miss Jones; gentlmen's first and chal
lenge cup, J. D. MacGavin; second,
Clarence Griffin; third, George Baker
and Herbert Long.
One of the* largest crowds ever seen
at isan Rafael witnessed the contests.
In the afternoon many of the specta
tors were unable to find seats in either
grand stand. The weather was not
distressingly hot. The light dresses
worn by the ladies made a pretty pic
ture.
The State championship tennis tour
nament was brought to a close yester
day on the Hotel Rafael courts. Both
ch'ampions met defeat at the hands of
the tournament winners. In the morn
ing Miss Hazel Hotchkiss, challenger,
beat Miss Miriam Edwards, defender.
In the afternoon J. Drummond Mac-
Gavin, challenger, beat Grant M.
Smith,: defender. V , .
Mr?. Miller of the San Francisco Golf
Club finished sr-cond. being *6even
strokes behind the winner. She drives
a long bail, but her short game was
nut effective yesterday. She was at a
disatvantage In not being accustomed
to the sarsd "greens."
Mrs. Scott had not played for two
years up to a month ago. and was
hardly prepared, for the strain of tour

peted for under match play conditions

CHICAGO, July 4.â Turf patrons cel
ebrated the Fourth at Hawthorne to
day with loyal enthusiasm. The crowd
began pouring into the track enclosure
early, and long ' before the bugle
sounded for the opening dash the spa
cious grandstand and lawn were filled
to their seating and standing capacity.
The weather was perfect and the track
good but not fast.
The feature of the card was the vace
at 1 1-8 miles, in which Colonial Girl,
McGee and Bad News hooked up. They
had the race to themselves. Colonial
Girl was . favorite at 6 to 5 with Bad
News second choice at 2 to 1 and Mc-
Gee at 5. But little money was
played on the others. To a bad start
Bad News and McGee were off in front
and were soon joined by Colonial Girl.
Bad News and Colonial Girl set the
pace around into the stretch, where
McGee came with a rush and in a
driving finish won on the wire by a
"head from Bad News. Coloni^ Girl
was four lengths back. Summary:

SHEEPSHEAD BAY, July 4.â The
Long Island handicap should- take rank
as the feature of ; the card at the track
this afternoon as included .among the
starters were Highball, winner of the
American Derby and of the Spindrift
stakes; Major Daingerfleld, conqueror
of "Africander and of Hermis'''on a
heavy track,/ and Hurst Park, the
stout, game horse with a recent good
record. The, outcome was, however, a
disappointment to the players of public
form, as the race was won by Major
Daingerfleld. This was due partly to
the interference suffered by the favor
ite, -Highball, on the clubhouse turn,
where, from a poor beginning, he fell
back to a bad last.
The Cricket proved to be the "good
thing" in the mile and a quarter race
on the turf. He led all the way. Such
fast horses as Leader and Carbuncle
finished behind him. The Cricket is
trained for his owners by John Allen,
who handled F. Ambrose Clark's sta
ble of cross-country hordes last year."

NESS THE WONDERFUL "DEMONSTRA-
TIONS OF THE NOTED LIVINGSTONE.
He Is no imitator. His work Is upon original
lines: Pure thought, clear vision. He tells
you what you desire to know and works in the
open light.
He Is as conspicuous for his wonderful occult
I analysis as he is for his original expression
, â¢ and vivid truthfulness.
A test reading* is not a life reading; when
you call on Prot". Livingstone he will give you
a full life reading for $1; a test is of little
value; when the mind Is troubled you need
more substantial aid and advice: this Is just
what Prof. Livingstone gives you when you call
on him for a first-class clairvoyant reading.
He asks you no questions, but tells you what
you wish to know.
Would it not be a relief to know how you
will succeed, to bo relieved of the matters
that are troubling you. and of the schemes of
your enemies, ihat you may meet with better
success?
He does not mention all the ills and misfor-
tunes you are heir to;' you are'acqualnted with
the facts in your case; let Prof. Livingstone
analyze the matters that are troubling you.
find the cause of the trouble and suggest the
remedy.
His only reason for giving your name In full
or any Important Information you may desire
Is that he does this Incidentally as a chain to
read by. â¢

CALL,BUREAU, HOTEL BARTON,
WASHINGTON', July 4. â The negro
population is not increasing so rapidly
as is the white population in the
Southern States. This is one conclu
sion that may be drawn from the
elaborate study of the neero statistics
of the census of 1900 by Professor
Walter E. Willcox of Cornell Univer
sity, which will soon be published by
the Census Office as a special bulletin.
There is much In this publication
strongly supporting the theory that if
the present tendencies in the South
continue for a few decades the negro
population in that section will become
stationary or will actually decrease.
The proportion of negroes. to white in
the Southern States has been rapidly
decreasing ever since the census of
1S60, as is shown. by the fact that be
tween 1860 and 1900 the Southern
negro population increased 93.4 per
cent and the Southern white popula
tion increased 134.9 per cent In 1900
the negroes constituted 32.3 per cent,
or nearly one-third of the total popu
lation of the Southern States.
Colonel Harrison, with the census
of 1880, shows that during the twenty
years preceding 1900 the negro popu
lation of the South increased 33.1 per
cent, or less than one-third, while in
the same period the white population
of the same section increased 56.5 per
cent, or considerably over 1 one-half.
This difference in the rate of increase
is due, in part, to the movement of
whites into Southern Stages from the
North and from foreign countries and
the movement of the negroes from the
South to the Northern States.
Much more important factors that
may eventually arrest the Increase of
the race are the higher death rate
among negroes, especially the negro
children, and the constantly declining
birth rate in that race.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
The Totmes came into port yesterday morn
ing with Fhlp dressed for the Fourth of July
As the vessel passed In between the heads her

Weather Report.
In the cozy cabin of the Holliswood
is an oil painting of the bark dismasted
ten years ago off the Horn. It was her
first voyage and she lost her main and
mizzen top masts and sails.
Captain Davis denies the reports that
the bark was out of food and her peo
ple suffering for the necessaries of life.
He received from the Prussia sugar
and a few articles for his wife and
child. He accuses the cook of being
wasteful and disobedient, and of origi
nating the starvation story. The cap
tain was formerly an officer on the
steamers Nebraska and Alaska of
the Hawaiian line, running be
tween this port and Honolulu. He
first took command of the Hollis
wood in Hongkong, succeeding his fa
ther, who died aboard the bark in
that port. Captain Davis is a young
man, almost boyish in appearance, but
the manner in which he has brought
his vessel with her sixteen hundred
tons of coal through one hundred and
thirty-two, days of almost constant
storm stamps him every inch a sailor.
Like a page out of some sea tale of
Stevenson or Clark Russell runs the
story of the bark Holllswood, which the
strong tue Dauntless yesterday hauled
Into port. Foretop mast, foretopgallant
mast, foreroyal mast, jib boom, flying
jib boom and spanker boom, with their
standing- rigging, were carried away. In
the seventeen days of fierce gales that
battered her even as she struggled
within sight of the lights Inviting her
to a safe anchorage. The storm that
finally dismasted her and almost com
pleted her undoing was the last effort
of the strong winds and rolling seas
that had met and worried her almost
constantly since she left the Australian
port ninety-eight days before.
This final effort of wind and wave
was on the night of June 2, when the
bark made Point Bonita, at the en
trance to the Golden Gate. The light
on the head shone clearly, but neither
tug nor pilot could be raised to the re
lief of the helpless vessel. A thick mist
came down on her and a stiff breeze
from the north-northwest, drove her
away from the harbor she was striving
to enter. Then came the seventeen days
of struggle with gale and sea, her spars
going over one by one and taking with
them all the head sails, all the canvas
on the fore exceDt the foresail, main
topgallant sail, royal and sky sail. This
left her the fore, main, main top sail
and fore staysail. It was then the
storm gave up the fight, and the crip
pled Holliswood limped into San Pedro
harbor.
She left Newcastle February 27, and
two days out ran into her first heavy
gale. The bark labored over the high
cross-seas until she sprung a leak,
which the steam pump succeeded in
keeping down. For twenty-one days
she fought her way over stormy ocean,
crossing the equator at 150 degrees 40
minutes west. She spoke the ship Prus
sia on May 26, and received certain
stores from her and the schooner Tran
sit on June 13. She made San Pedro
June 24. She was then under her own
sailâ what was left of it.
Aboard the bark with Captain Davis
are Mrs. Davis and their infant daugh
ter Eileen, eighteen months old. Mrs.
Davis has been accompanying her hus
band to sea for the last five years. Her
other voyages have been quiet ones
and she now feels that all the storms
she missed in the five previous trips
have been crowded into this last one.
"About all I did," Mrs. Davis said
yesterday, "during our seige of twen
ty-one davs in the South Pacific and
during the seventy days off this coast
was to sit in the far corner of my berth
and hold babv. O, but the bark did
roll! And what awful thundering
noises were made when the spars and
sails broke away from the vessel! But
I suppose I shall have it over again
sometime, as I cannot content myself
to live ashore when mv husband is
at sea."

adopted party. Ushers will see that
all are properly seated and that crowd
ing is avoided.

sengers were ejected during Sunday
when the- cars reached Neck road,
where the second nickel is taken. The

on the question was to the effect that
passengers were entitled to ride all the
way for 5 cents.
Many free fights occurred. A large

car at Keck road and in two instances
they were beaten off when passen

Sheriff Bell said that nothing would
be done in the matter of Moyer's bond
until to-morrow. It is understood that
all preliminaries to supplying a bond
for 510,000 have been arranged, and that
to-morrow the formal signing of the
bond will occur and Moyer be set free.
Moyer has been confined as \ a mili
tary and civil prisoner for 102 days. He
Is at present charged with murder as a
result of the riot at Victor, Colo., the
day following the Independence explo
sion. The informations filed against
Moyer are the outgrowth of a circular
issued by the old executive board of the
Western Federation of Miners and are
based on the Illinois case of August
Spies, who, though far away from the
scenes of the Haymarket riot, was held
equally guilty with the actual partici
pants because of certain writings and
speeches, which it was claimed Incited
others to riot.
The only demonstration occurred as
Sheriff Bell and his charge were step
ping on a street car. Three cheers for
Moyer were called for and given- veith
zest. The party went at once to a hotel
and registered.

pose of securing his freedom on bond.
None of the officers of the federation
were at the depot to greet him, al
though a crowd was gathered on the
depot platform, in which was a group
of deported Cripple Creek and Tellu
ride miners.

During the intervals of labor in the
orchards and fields they lose no oppor
tunity to improve themselves by study,
with the result that on their return to

TO WHOM IT MAT CONCERN: A year and
three months ago I was attacked with that
terrible disease, locomotor ataxla. Power to
balance, stand, or even sit down, entirely lost.
Two best doctors of San Francisco and Hot
Spring*. Ark., failed to help me. My stom-
ach, bowels and kidneys failed to work. I had
catarrh of stomach head and bladder as a re-
sult of the disease; these troubles bKtm*
chronic. At times my heart would beat like a
arum, my eyes grew weak, my memory bad.
T nerves wrecked. Three months ago I went
to Tuscan Springs. What happened since was
a pleasant surprise to me. Drank the waters,
took the baths â after three weeks' treatment
stomach, bowels, bladder and kidneys In per-
fect condition, eyesight perfect, nervousness
gone, memory good. After three months' treat-
ment, walked without a cane, with eyes closed
and up and down steep hills; am cured of this
dread disease, now walk with slight limp.
Have run stores In seventeen towns of the
State of California; am well known in down-
town districts of San Francisco; inquiry there
will prove truth of my helpless condition three
months ago. Further Information, addreas

IT'S FUNNY how so many men act.
They toil and labor and struggle.
AND NEVER for a moment think of
rest, or recreation, or pleasure.
AHD HOW FOOLISH for those re-
siding in this vicinity, when right
at their door lies the playground,
quickly and cheaply reached.
IF YOU WILL NOT occasionally
give up the daily grind,
DO NOT make your wife and chil-
dren continually walk the treadmill.
AT LEAST give them a chance for
a little change of air that will bring
some color to their cheeks.
PERHAPS then you will find time to
visit them over Sunday.
AND FORGET yourself as your
children poke grass down your
neck, and in your nose and eyes
and ears.
GET OUT once in a while and romp.
BREAK AWAY and give your fam-
ily a chance to get acquainted with
you,

Susie Miller of Los Angeles and a Man
of the Same Name Supposed to
Have Come Here.
A dispatch appeared in yesterday's
Call from Los Angeles saying that
Matt Eddy had complained to the po
lice there that his stepsister, who was
only 16 years of age, had eloped with a
Â¦well-known San Franciscan and that
they had probably come to this city to
get married. Eddy had threatened all
sorts of vengeance upon the man in
the case, whose name he refused to
divulge.
About 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon
C. H. Bennett, 2701% Sutter street,
called at police headquarters and said
he had received a dispatch from Eddy
asking him to notify the" police here
of the elopement and to have the pair
arrested. Bennett said the girl's name
was Susie Miller and the man with
â¢whom che eloped was . also named
liiller, but that was all he knew about
him. Bennett was informed that he
should have made his appearance
earlier, as the trains from Los Angeles
on which the eloping pair might have
come were all in.
A watch will be kept to-day upon
the marriage license office* and If an
application is made for a license for
the Millers the applicant wlll.be placed

POLICE ASKED TO FIND
GIRL WHO HAS ELOPED
J. W. Raphael to Start on IiOng Trip
by Way of Japan â Business
nnd Pleasure.
A half year tour around the world
has been one of the pleasurable an
ticipations of J. W. Raphael of Ra
phael's, Inc., and feeling that the large
business of the. store is running
smoothly he is about to commence the
long journey.
From here the merchant will go to
Japan, where he will be close to the
scene of the bloody struggle with Rus
sia. Thence he will go to India and
hopes to find his way into the, jungles
famed in story. From the Orient he
will proceed through the Red Sea and
Suez and from that waterway a tour
of the Mediterranean lands be
made. The trip from the sunny climes
will then be extended through all of
Europe, excepting Russia.
Pleasure will be mingled with busi
ness on Mr. Raphael's protracted
jaunt, and besides seeing the sights of
the other half of the world he "will
inspect the large mercantile houses
and investigate the methods of ' run
ning them. Such new ideas as he
may find and consider good will be
adapted later in the form of improve
ments and enlargements in Raphael's
San Francisco business.
The twenty-third annual gathering
and games of the Scottish Thistle
Club, held yesterday at Shell Mound
Park, was the most successful in the
history of the organization. Fully
12,000 people, visited the grounds. The
lads and lassies, dressed in the cos
tumes of the clans and mingling with
the guests, who wore conventional
clothing, lent picturesqueness to the
scene among the trees.
While Scottish airs were played by a
brass band for the benefit of the danc
ers at one end of the grounds, con
testants in Gaelic games exerted them
selves to the utmost at the other end
to the music of Highland pipes. A
feature of the day, and one rarely wit
nessed in this country, was the danc
ing by little girls in Highland costume.
To the music of the pipes they pirouet
ted gracefully on a raised ; platform,
winning salvos of applause from the
throng assembled in the grand stand
and around'the track.
The races and other events were all
closely contested and 'came off without
a hitch of any kind. The tug of war
contest was won by the married clans
men, captained by Hugh Fraser, who
defeated the single men under Rob
ert H. Murray. The prizes for; the best
dressed boys in Highland costume
were won by Kenneth McRae, James
Trevltwick and Colin Grant; for the
best dressed men in full Highland cos
tume, by Neil' Lindsay, William Grant
and Hugh Fraser, and for the best
dressed men in plain Highland costume
by E. Ross, D. D. McRae and James
Sinclair.

Members of the Ancient Order of
Hibernians, their wives, sweethearts
and friends gathered for a grand an
nual picnic of the order at Schuetzen
Park yesterday. All morning ferry and
train discharged human freight to swell
the number inside the grounds. The
dancing pavilion was crowded and the
booths did a rushing business. All
kinds of races for all kinds of people,
broad and high Jumping, hammer
throwing and other athletic sports de
lighted thousands of spectators and oc
cupied the entire afternoon.
Few left before the games were fin
ished and the consequence was that
all wanted to get home by the first
train, although there were other trains
wtiitlng. The crush at the car plat
forms was so great that many were
forced between the, cars and under the
tiucks of the wheels. "When the train
pulled out It was packed. The condi
tion of the ferryboat Ukiah of the
Tiburon line was. even worse. The peo
ple were packed so tignt that there
was no. room : for J any one to -move.'
Many preferred to stay outside on the
upper deck in the cold fog rather than
take chances below in case of accident.
No accident happened, however, and
both timid and brave were landed at
the ferry building in safety.
The following committees had the
picnic In charge:

Bryant street, has been missing since
last Wednesday and his parents fear
that he may have been drowned. The

and often went bathing with other
boys.
To be sensible at home and amiable
outside is a task greater than most
persons Imagine.
The suicide of Lieutenant Gullford S.
Garber at Honolulu has caused another
Eensatic-n. in army circles here. This
suicide, coupled with that of Captain
Frederick S. Wild at Angel Island only
a few weeks before, â¢ is making the
crmy people ask, "Who next?" No
positive explanation has been offered
for the act of either of these officers in
taking his life. Both were young, able,
vigorous and ambitious. Both stood
veil in the army and in civilian life,
yet, in spite of all these qualifications,
they elected to end their lives.
Garber was well known and much
liked by his brother officers at the Pre-
Eidio. He was always hale-fellow-well
met and during his sojourn at the post
was very popular there and in the
city.
He left here on May 1 with the
Ninety-second Company Coast Artil
lery bound fot Honolulu. He entered
the army from civil life in 1898, being
one of the Indiana volunteers, and in
1893 he Joined the Thirtieth Infantry
United States Volunteers.
LEFT CHECK TO PAY DEBTS.
In his farewell note, found after his
death, he said in a few words that he
could not break himself of his drink
ing habit and he inclosed in it two
checks. One was left to a friend, to be
disbursed in paying some small loans
he had received from his comrades
while stationed at the Presidio, and the
other to paj- debts in the islands.
Garber was born in Indiana on Oc
tober 27, 1B75.
The Third squadron of the Ninth
Cavalry and the First, Fifth and
Twenty-fourth batteries Field Artil
lery, under command of Colonel E. A.
Godwin, will leave the Presidio to
morrow morning at 9: SO o'clock for
Henry, ranch. From the Presidio they
will march directly down Seventh ave
nue, through the park and thence via
Ingleside to the San Mateo road and
to their' objective point. They expect
to spend about twelve days in this
march of 220 miles.-
Information has just been received
from Manila that Colonel Charles
Smart, chief surgeon of the division
of the Philippines, has suffered a stroke
of apoplexy. He will be brought home
