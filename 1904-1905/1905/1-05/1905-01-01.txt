T N are presented the chords of the
I key of F sharp and its relative, the key of D
â  sharp minor. Both of the*: keys are regarded
* as difficult for beginners in music to under
talsje, butÂ»with the use of the charts the chords may
be'readily played and soon committed to memory.
Place one of the charts at right angles with the
keyboard", so that thesmall letter D with a dash
above it'on the chart is directly over Don the key
board. Then the white spaces on the chart will be
over the white keys and black spaces over the black
keys.
The top, middle and lower sections on the
lower chart represent the three chords, a mastery ,
of which will enable any one to accompany on the
piano any song or melody in the key of E, and
the upper chart represents the chords of the key
of D sharp minor. The black letters are to be
played with the left hand, the colored letters with
the right hand.
Now having placed the chart on the piano,
play the black letter on the top section witrr the
left hand and then the three colored letters in
unison with the right hand. Next play the mid
dle section in the same way, then the lower section
and then return to the top section. The small
. letter D with a dash above it which gives the
chart position must not be played.
The knowledge of the keys and facility in *
striking the : proper chords form the basis of all
musical knowledge. Keep the chart on the piano
until yon are thoroughly Jamiliar with the chords
in the keys given in this week's lesson, and, when
memorized, you are quite as well equipped for the
playing of accompaniments as one who has studied
music for years.
EIGHTH LESSON NEXT SUNDAY,ThiÂ« is the first installment of "The Brethren," H. Rider Hag- - j
gard's latest work. Mr. Haggard needs no introduction. "She." j
"Allan Quartermain," "Kins Solomon's Mines"' and a dozen other J
eqnnlly absorbing romances have made his name a household word. j
in the present novel the author- lias almost entirely* departed from '
the weird, Imaginative sensationalism of his earlier books and has ;
devoted himself t<> the tools of the writer of the legitimate bistort- ;
eaf novel. In "The Brethren" Mr. Haggard nas stamped himself as \
a master of the modern historical romance.
Following "The Brethren" will appear "The Castaway." by Hal
lie Ermlnie Rives, to be followed by Booth Tarklngtoil's "Monsieur
Beaucairc." â¢

PROLOGUE. .
A-V Commander of
LJ th* Faithful, the King strong .to
aid, Sovereign of ;the East, sat at.
U night in his palace at Damascus
and brooded on the Wonderful
of God, by whom he had been
lifted to his high estate. He. remem
bered how., when he was but small in
the eyes of men, Nour-eel-din, .King of
Syria, forced him to accompany his up- .
cle, Shirkuh, to Eeypt, wh'UUer.he went,.
"like one driven to his death,"-and how,
against his. own will, there .he arose to,
greatness. He thought at his -fathfsr,.
the .wise Ayoub, and the brethren with
who hÂ« was brought up, ail of them
dead now save one; and,of his sisters,
whom he had cherished. Most of all did
he think of her, who had been
stolen away by the knight whom she
loved even to the loss of Iter own soulâ
yes by the English friend of bis youth,
his fathers prisoner, : Sir . Andrew
D'Arcy, who, led astray Toy passion,
had done him'and his house this- griev
ous wrong, fie had sworn, he .remem
bered, that he would '.bring her back
even from England, and already had
planned to kill her husband .arid cap
ture her when he learned her death.
She had Jeft a child, or so .his spies
told him, who, if she still lived, must,
be a woman, nowâhis own niece,
though half of noble English blood. â¢
Then his mind wandered from this
old half-forgotten story of the woe and
blood in which his days- were setÂ» and
to the last great struggle between the
followers of the prophets Jesus and
Mohamet, that *Jibad for which he
made readyâand he sighed. For he
was a merciful man,, who loved not
slaughter, although his fierce faith"
drove him on from war to war. .
Sa!ah-ed-dln slept and dreamed of
peace. In his dream a maiden stood
before him, and when she lifted her
veil, he saw that she was beautiful,
with features .like his own, but fairer,
and knew her surely for the daughter
t of his own sister who had fled with'
the English knight. Now he wondered
why she visited him thus, and lh his
' vision prayed Allah to make the mat
\ ter clearer. Then suddenly he saw this
, same woman standing before him on a
Syrian plain, and on either side of her
a countless host of Saracens' and
Franks, of Whom thousands and tens
of thousands were appointed to death.
Lo! he, Salah-ed-din, charged -at the
head of his squadrons, scimitar aloft,'
but she held up- her .hand and stayed
him- -tsÂ»
."What do you* here, my niece?"- he:
asked.
"I am come to save the' lives of men
through you,"" she .answered; "and
therefore was I born of your blood, and
therefore sent to you. Put up
- your sword, King, and spare them.." ;
"Say, maiden, what ransom do â¢ you.
bring to buy this multitude from
doom? What ransom and what gift?" ;
"The ransom of my own blood, free-,
ly offered, and heaven's gift of peace
to your sinful soul, O King."
â¢ Then with that outstretched hand
she drew down Ms keen-edged scimitar
and it rested upon her breast.
Salah-ed-din awoke and marveled'on
his dream, but said nothing of it to any
man. The next night It returned â¢to
him, and the memory of it went with
him all'the day that foTlbwed, "but still
he said nothing.
When on the t" -d night he dreamed
it yet again, even iriore vfvidly. then
he was sure that this thing was from
God, and summoned his holy Imauns
and his. Diviners, and took counsel with
them. These, after they had listened,
prayed and consulted, spoke thus:
"O Sultan, Allah has warned you in
shadows that the woman, your* niece,
who dwells far away in England, shall
by her own nobleness and sacrifice, in
some time to come, srttve you from
shedding a sea of blood, and bring rest
upon the land. We charge you, there
fore, draw this lady to your court and
keep her ever by your side, since if
she escapes you, her peace goes with
her."
Salah-ed-din said that this interpre
tation was wise and true, for thus also
he had read his dream. Then he sum
moned a certain false knight who bore
the Crosg upon his breast, but in secret
hafl accepted the Koran, a Frankish
spy of bin, who came from that coun
try where dwelt the maiden, his niece,
and from him learned about her, her
father and her home. With him and
another spy who passed as a Christian
palmer, by the aid of Prince Hassin,
one of the greatest and most trusted of
his Emirs, he made a cunning plan for
the capture Qf the maiden If she would
not come willingly, and for her bearing
away to Syria. Moreoverâthat in the
eyes of all men her dignity might be
worthy of her high blood and (ateâby
â¢Holy
his decree he created her,: the niece
. whom he hed never seen. Princess of
Baalbec, .with great possessionsâa rule
that herffgrandfather, Ayoub, and her
' uncle, libieddin, >.bad held before her.
Mso he purchased a stout galley of
war, manning it with proved sailors
and with chosen, men at arms, under
the command of the Fringe Hassan,
and wrote a letter to the English L,ord.
Sir Andrew D'Arcy. and h j s. daughter,
â¢a-nd prepared a royal gift of jewels, and
sent, them to- the lady,, his niece, far
away in England, and*with it the pat-
of her rank. Her 'he .commanded
this company to win .by peace, or force,
â  or-fraud, as best-'they might, but that
without her not one.-of them- should
dare to look upon his fa-ec again. And
with these'he sent the. two Prankish
' spie.s, who 'knew the place where the
lady.'lived, 'one qf- .whom; the false
â¢ knight, was a skilled mariner and the
.captain o.f the-ship.
.These things did Yusuf Saiah-ed-din,
and. waited patiently till â it should
please' to accomplish the vision
with which God had filled his soul in
. sleep:
CHAPTER I.
'*' - *
By .the Watevs of Deatii Creek. Â»
From the seawall on the coast of
Essex Rosamund looked out across the
ocean eastward. - To right and left, but
. a'little .behind her, like guards attend
ing 'the person of their sovereign, stood
her the twin brethren, God
wih and Wulf r tall and shapely men.
Godwin was still as a statue, his hahds
folded over the hilt of the long scab
barded sword, of which the point was
. set on-the ground before him, but Wiilf,
â¢ his brother, moved restlessly, and' at
length yawned aloud. They were beau
tiful to look at, all three of them, as
. they appeared in the splendor of their
youth and health. The imperial Rosa
'.mund, dark haired and eyed, ivory
skinned and slender waisted, a posy of
marsh' Mawers in her hand; the pale,
â¢ stately Godwin, with his dreaming
face; and the bold-fronted warrior.
Wulf, Saxon to his imger tips, notwith
standing his father's Norman blood.
At the-sound of that'unstifled yawn
Rosamund turned her head with the
.slaw, grace. -which . marked her every
movement.' â¢ ' â¢
â¢ , i'Would you sieep already, Wulf. and
the sun-not.yet down?" she asked In
her rich, low voice,,' which, perhaps be
. cause, of its â  foreign accent, seemed
quite different" to that of -any other
: woman. '..'â¢'.'
"I think so, Rosamund," he answer
â  cd." "It would' serve to pass the time,
and now that, you have finished gath'
; ering those yellow flowers which wv.
rode so far to seek, the timeâis some
what lons."
"Shame on you, Wulf," she said,
â¢smiling. "Look upon yonder sea and
sky, at that sheet of bloom all gold and
. purpleâ"
T have looked for hard .on. half an
hour, cousin Rosamund; also at your
back, and at .Godwin's left arm and
side face; till in truth I thought my
self kneeling in Stangate Priory star
ing at my father's effigy upon his tomb,
while Prior John pattered the mass.
Why, If you stood' it on its feet, it is
Godwin, the same crossed hands rest
jng on the sword, the same cold, silent
face staring at,the sky."
"Godwin as Godwin will no doubt
one day be, or sq he hopesâthat., is, if
â¢the saints give him grace to do such
deeds as did our sire," Interrupted his
brother. ;
Wulf looked at him and a curious
flash of inspiration shone in hia blue
â¢yes- â¢'..'.'
"No, I think" not," he answered: "the
deeds you may do, and greater,: but
surely you will lie wrapped not'in a
.shirt of mail,, but with a monk's cowl
:. at the lastâunless a woman robjl you
of it and the quickest road to heaven.
Tell me now,- what are you thinking of,
you twoâfor I have been wondering in
my dull way, and am curious to leacn
how far I, stand from truth? Rosa
: mund, speak first. Nay, not all the
. truthâa maid's thoughts are her "own,
but just the cream of it, that which
rises to the top and can be skimmed."
-. sighed.
"I? I was thinking of ' the East,
where the sun shines ever and the
seas are blue as my girdle stones, and
men are fall of strange learningâ'
"And women are men's slaves!" In
terrupted Wulf. "Still It Is natural that
you should think of the East-who have
that blood in 'your veins, and high
blood, if all tales be true. Say, Prin
cess"âand he bowed the "knee to her
with an affectation of mockery wjiich
could not hide his earnest reverenceâ
"say, Princess, my cousin, grand
daughter of Ayoub and niece of the
mighty monarch, Yusuf Salah-ed-din.
dd yOu wish to leave this pale land and
visit your dominions in Egypt and in
Syria?" . '
She listened, and at his words her
eyes seemed to take fire, the stately
form to erect itself, the breast to heave
and the thin nostrils to grow wider as
though, they scented some sweet, re
membered perfume. Indeed, at that
moment, standing there on the promon
tory above the seas, Rosamund looked
a very queen.
. Presently she answered him with an
other question.
"And how would they greet me
there, Wulf, who am a Norman d'Arcy
and a Christian maid?"
"The first they-would forgive you,
since that blood is none so ill either!
and for the secondâwhy, faiths can be
changed." . . "
Then it was that Godwin spoke for
the first time.
â¢ "Wulf." Wulf," he said sternly, "keep
watch upon your tongue, for there are
things that should not be said even
as a silly Jest. See you, I love my
cousin here better than aught else upon
the earthâ"
"There, at least, we ; agree," broke in
Wulf. ~
"Better than aught else on the earth."
repeated Godwin: "but, by the â¢ Holy
Blood and by St. Peter, at whose shrine
we stand, I would kill her by my own
band before her Hps kissed the book
of the false prophet."
"Or any. of his followers," muttered
Wulf to himself, but fortunately, per
haps, too low for either of his com
panions to hear. Aloud he said. "You
understand, Rosamund, you must be
careful, for Godwin ever keeps his
word, and that would be but a poor end
for so much birth and beauty and wis
dom."
"Oh, cease mockin.tr. Wulf," she an
swered, laying her baud lightly on the
tunic that hid his shirt of mall. "Cease
mocking and pray St. Chad, the build
er of this shrine, that no such dreadful
choice may ever be forced upon you.
or me, or your beloved brotherâwho,
indeed, In such a case would do right
to slay me."
"Well, if It were," answered Wulf,
and his fair face flushed as he spoke,
"I trust that we should know how to
meet It. After all. Is it so very hard
to choose between death and duty?"
'"I know not," she replied; "but oft
times sacrifice seems easy when seen
from far away; also, sometimes things
may be lost that are more prized than
life."
"What things? Do you mean place
or wealth, orâlove?"
"Tell me," said Rosamund, changing
her tone, "what is that boat rowing
round th*Â» river's mouth? A while ago
it hung upon its oars as though those
within it watched us."
"Flsher-folk," answered Wulf care
lessly. "I saw their nets."
"Yes; but beneath them something
gleamed bright, like swords."
"Fish," said Wulf; "we are at peace
in Essex." Although Rosamund did
not look convinced, he went, on, "Now
for Godwin's thoughtsâwhat were
they?"
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL",
"Brother, If know, of the
East alsoâthe East and its holy wars."
i "Which have brought us no great
luck," answered Wulf, "seeing that our
sire was slain in them and naught of
i him came home again save his heart,
! which lies at Stangate yonder."
' "How better could he die," asked
1 Godwin, "than fighting for the Cross
' of Christ? Is not that death of his at
Harenc told of to this day? By our
Lady, I pray for one but half as glo-
r ious!"
'â  "Aye, he died well, he died well," said
J Wulf, his blue eyes flashing and his
' hand creeping to his sword hilt. "But,
â¢ brother, there "is peace at Jerusalem,
; as in Essex."
"Peace? Yes; but soon there will be
war again. The monk Peter, he whom
we saw at Stangate last Sunday, and
who left Syria but six months goneâ
[ told me that it was coming fast. Even
1 now the Sultan Saladin, sitting at Da
mascus, summons his hosts from far
â  and wide, while his priests preach bat
i tie among the tribes and barons of the
' East. And when it comes, my brother,
' shall we not be there to share it, as
were our grandfather, our father, out
s uncle, and so many of our kin? Shall
we rot here in this dull land, as by our
â  uncle's wish we have done these many
; years, yes, ever since we were home
i from the Scottish war, and count the
> kine and plow the fields like peasants,
while our peers are charging on the pa
gans, and the banners wave and the
blood runs red upon the holy sands of
; Palestine?"
Now it was Wulf's turn to take fire.
> "By gar Lady in Heaven, and our
! lady here:"âand he looked at Rosa
r mund, who was watching the pair of
Â» them with her quiet thoughtful eyesâ
"go when you will,, brother, and I go
with you, and as our birth was one
birth, so, if it is decreed, let our death
be one death." And suddenly the hand*
that had been playing with the sword
hilt grlrped it fast, and tore the long,
lean blade from its scabbard and cast
it high Into the air, flashing in the sun
light, to catch it as it fell again, while
in a voice tfcrat caused the wild fowl to
rise in thunder from the Saltings be
neath Wulf shouted the old war cry
that had rung on so many a fieldâ"A
D'Arcy! a D'Arcy! Meet D'Arcy, meet
Death!" Then he sheathed his sword
again and added in a shamed voice,
"Are we children that we fight where
no foe is? Still, brother, may we find
him soon!"
Godwin smiled grimly, but answered
nothing; only Rosamund said:
"So, my cousins, yor would be away,
perhaps to return no more, and that
would part us. But"âand her voice
broke somewhatâ"such is the woman's
lot, since men like you ever love the
bare sword best of all, nor should I
think well of you were it otherwise.
Yet, cousins, I know not why"âand she
shivered a littleâ"it comes into my
heart that heaven often answers BUch
prayers swiftly. Oh, Wuli, .our sword
looked very red In the sunlight, but
now; I Baw that it looked very red in
the sunlight. lam afraidâof I know
not what. Well, we must be going, for
we have nine miles to ride, and the
dark ia not so far away. But first* my
cousins, come with me Into this holy
place, and let us pray St. Peter and
St. Chad to guaM us on our journey
home." , s
"Our journey?" said Wulf anxiously.
"What is there for you to fear in a
nine-mile ride along the shores of the
Blackwater?"
"I said our journey home, Wulf; and
home is not in the hall at Steeple, but
yonder," and she pointed to the quiet,
brooding sky.
"Well said," answered Godwin, "in
this ancient place, whence so many
have Journeyed home; all the Romans
who are dead, when It was their for
tress, and the Saxon who came after
them, and others without count."
Then they turned and entered the
old churchâone of the first thai ever
was in Britain, rough-built of Roman
stone by the very'hands of Chad, the
Saxon saint, more than 500 years be
fore their day. Here they knelt a while
at the rude altar and prayed, each of
them in hls< or her own fashion, then
crossed themselves, and rose to seek
their horses, which were tied in the
shed hard by.
Now there were two roads, or rather
tracks, back to the Hall at Steeple
one a mile or so inland, that ran
through the village of Bradweil, and
the other, the shorter way, along the
edge of the Saltings to the narrow
water known as Death Creek, at the
head of which the traveler to Steeple
must strike inlapd, leaving the Priory
of Stangate on his right." It was this
latter path they choose, since at low
tide the going there is good for horses
âwhich, even in the summer, that of
the Inland track was not. Also they
wished to be at home by supper time,
lest the old knight. Sir Andrew D'Arcy.
the father of Rosamund and the uncle
of the orphan brethren, should grow
anxious, and perhaps, come out to seek
thbrn.
For the half of an hour or more they
rode along the edge' of the Saltings, for
the most part in silence, that was
broken only by the cry of curlew and
the lap of the turning tide. No human
being did they see, indeed, for this place
feotjatd.
was very desolate and unvlstted, save
now and again by fishermen, At length.
Just as the sun began to sink, they
approached the shore of Death Creekâ
a sheet of udal water which ran a
njile or more Inland, growing ever nar
rower, but was here some 300 yards
in breadth. They were well mounted,
all three of them. Indeed, KoÃamtind's
horse, a great gray, her father's gift to
her, was famous in that country-side
for its swiftness and power, also be
cause it was so docile that a child could
ride it; while those of the brethren
were heavy-built but well trained war
steeds, taught to stand when they were
left, and to charge when they were
urged, without fear of shouting men or
flashing steel.
Now the ground lay thus. Some sev
enty yards from the shore of the creek
&nd parallel to it a tongue of land,
covered with scrub and a few oaks, ran
down Into the Saltings, its point end
ing on their path, beyond which were
a awamp and a broad river. Between
this tongue and the shore of the creek
the track wended its way to the up
lands. It was an ancient track: indeed
the reason of its existence was that
here the Romans or some other long
dead hands had built a narrow mole
or quay of rough stone, forty or fifty
yards in length, out into the water of
the creek, doubtless to serve as a con
venience for fisher boats, which could
lie alongside of it even at low tide. This
mole bad been much destroyed by cen
turies of washing, so that the end of It
lay below water, although the land
ward part was still almost sound and
level.
doming over the little rise at the tip
of me wooded tongue, the quick eyes
of Wulf, who rode firstâfor here the
path along the border of the swamp
was so narrow that they must go In
single fileâcaught Bight of a large
empty boat moored to an iron ring Bet
in the wall of the mole.
"Your fishermen have landed, Rosa
mund," he said, "and doubtless gone up
to Bradwell."
"That Is strange," she added* anx
iously, "since here no fishermen ever
come." And she checked her horse as
though to turn.
"Whether they come or not, certainly
they have gone," said Godwin, craning
forward to look about him; "so, as we
have nothing to fear from an empty
boat, let us push on."
On they rode accordingly until they
came to the root of the stone quay or
pier, when a sound behind them caused
them to look back> Then they saw a
sight that gent the blood to their hearts,
for there behind them, leaping down
one by one on that narrow footway,
were men armed with naked swords,
six or eight of them, all of whom, they
noted, had strips of linen pierced with
eyelet holes tied beneath jh<?ir helms
or leather caps, so as to cfneeal their
faces. .1
"A snare! a snare!" cried Wulf,
drawing his sword. "Swiftt follow me
up the Bradwell path," he struck
the spurs into his horse. It bounded
forward, to be dragged next second
with all the weight of his powerful arm
almost to its haunches. "God's mer
cy!" he cried, "there are more of
them!" And more there wx-re, for an
other band of men arm 41 t and linen
hooded like the first, ha 4 h>aped down
to trvÂ»t Bradwell path, ait<ong them* a
stout man, who seemed to. be unarmed,
except for a long crooked knife at his
girdle and a coat of ringed Â«uaU, which
showed through the opening of his loose
"To the boat," shouted Godwin,
whereat the sto'it man laughedâa
light, penetrating laugh, which even
then all three of them heard and noted.
Along the quay they rode, since there
was nowhere else that they could go,
with both paths, barred, and swamp
and water on one. side of them, and a
steep wooded bank upon the . other.
When they reached It, they found why
the man had laughed, for the boat was
made fast with a strong chain that
could not be cut; more, her sail -and
oars were gone.
"Get Into it," mocked a voice; "or, at
least, let the lady get in; it will save
us the trouble of carrying her there."
Now Rosamund turned very pale,
while the face of Wulf went red and
white, and he gripped his sword-hilt.
But Godwin, calm as ever, rode for
ward a few paces, and said quietly:
"Of your courtesy, say what you
need of us. If it be money, we have
noneânothing but our arms and horses,
which I think may cost you dear."
the man with the crooked knife
advanced a little, accompanied by an
other man, a tall, supple looking knave,
into whose ear he whispered.
"My master says," answered the tall
man, "that you have with you that
which is of more value than all the
king's goldâa very fair lady, of whom
some one has urgent need. Give her up
now, and go your way with your arms
and horses, for you are valiant men,
whose blood we do not wish to shed."
At this it was the turn of the breth
ren to Jaugh, which both of them did
together.
"Give her up," answered Godwin,
"and go our ways dishonored? Aye.
with our breath, but not before. WhÂ°
has then such urgent need of the Lady
Rosamund?" * p
Again there was whM#Â«ing between
the pair.
"My master says," was thÂ«s answer,
"he thinks that all who see lÂ«r will
have need for her. slace such loveli-i
ness is rare. But if you wish n name,
well, one comes into his mir t d. the
name of the Knight Loselle!"
"The Knight Lozelle!" mu-mured
Rosamund, turning even paler than
before, as well pli? might. For this
Loxelle was a powerful man and
Essex-born. He owned ships of whoa*
doings upon the seas and in the East
evil were told, and once had
sought Rosamund's hand in marriage
but being rejected, uttered threats for
which Godwin, as the elder of tht
twins, had fought and wounded him
Then he vanished ânone knew where
"Is Sir Hugh Lozelle here-then?'
asked Godwin, "masked like you com
mon cowards? If so, I desire to meet
him, to finish the work I began in the
snow last Christma* twelvemonths."
"Find that out if you can," an
swered the tall man. But Wu.f said,
speaking low between his clenched
teeth:
"Brother, I see but one chance. We
must phve Rosamund between us and
charge them."
The caataln of the band seemed to
read their thoughts, for again he
whispered into the ear of his com
panion, vho again called out:
"My master says that If you try to
charge you will be fools, since wÂ«
shall stab and hamstring your horse?
yhich are too good to waste, and tak J
you quite easily as you fall. Com* 1
then, yield as you can do withoi
shame, seeing that there is no esoap*"
and that two men, however brave,
cannot stand against a crowd. Hf
gives you one minute to surrender."
Now Rosamund spoke for the first
time.
"My cousins," she said. "I pray you
not to let me fall living into the hands
Â©f Sir Hugh Lozelle or of yonder men."i â . i

Deeto it sank, but not for long,, tor
presently its rider's head rose above
the * water, and regaining the saddle;,
frorti which she had floated. Rosamund
sat firm and headed it straight for the
distant bank Now a shout-of wonder
ment went up from the woman thieves,
for this was a deed that they had- new
er dreamed a girl would dare. Rut the
1 rethren laughed as they saw that â¢
the horse swam' well, and', leaping
from their saddles, ran forward a feyv
pacesâeight or t-enâalong the mole to
where It was narrowest, as they weiu.
tearing the cloaks from their should-"
ers, and since they had none, throw
ing them over their feft. arms to serve
as bucklers. The band cursed sullenly,
enly their captain gave an order to his
spokesman, who cried out: â¢â¢
"Cut them down, and .to the boat!
We shall take her before she reaches
shore or drowns."
For a moment they wavered, for the
tall twin warriors who barred the way
had eyes that told of wounds and
d-ath. Then with a rush they came,
scrambling over the rough stones.; but
here the cause >vay was-so narrow that
â while their strength lasted, two men
were as good as twenty, nor, because
of the riud and water, could they be
got at from either side. So after all it
was but two to two, and the brethren
v ere the better two. Their long swords
flashed and smote, and then Wulf's
was llftel again, once more it was red
as it had been when he tossed It .high
in,the sunlight, and a man fell with a
heavy silash into the waters of the
. reek, aril wallowed there till he died.
Godwin's foe was down also, and, as
It seemed sped.
Then, a a muttered word, not wait
ing to be attacked by others, the breth
ren sprang forward. The huddled mob;
in front < l them saw them come, and
shrank ba k, but before they had gone
a yard th swords were at work be
hind. They swore strange oaths, they
< aught ti.eir feet among the rocks,'
and rolled upon their faces- In thefr
confusion rhree-of them were pushed
into the wdter. where two sank In the
mud and were drowned, the third only
dragged hinstif ashore, while the rest
made good !heir escape from the cause
way. But iwtt had been cut down, and
three had lallpn. for whom there was
ii" escape. They strove to .rise and
fifcht. but tae linen masks flapped about
their eyes, so that their blows went
wide, while the long swords of the
brothers sin ite and smote again upon
their helms and harness as the ham
mers of sm ths smite upon, an anvil,'
until they rdled over silent and stir
less.
"Back!" srid Godwin, "for here the
road is wide and they will get behind
us."
So back they moved slowly, with
their faces to the foe, stepping Just
in front of the first man whom Godwin .
had seemed to kill, and who lay :'u'e
upwards and with arms outstretched.
"So far w< have done well," said
Wulf, with a short laugh. "Are you
hurt?"
"Nay." answered his brother, "but â 
boast not till the battle is over, for
many are left and they will come on
thus no more. Pray God they have no
spears or bows."
Then he turned and looked behind
him, and there, far from the shore
now, swam the gray' horse steadily,
and there upon its back sat Rosamund
Y<_-s, and she had seen, since, the horsa
must swim somewhat sideways with
the tide, for hok, she took the ker
chief from her throat and waved It to
them. Then the brethren knew thdt
:-h" was proud of their great deeds,
and thanked their saints that they
had lived to do even so much as this
for her dear sake.
Goodwin was right. Although their
leader command-d them in a stern
voice, the band Sank from the reach .of
those awful swords, and, instead,
sought for stonet to hurl at them. But
here was more n.ud than" pebbles, and
the pucks of which the causeway was
built were too heavy for them to lift,
so that they fo:nd but few, which
when thrown eÃher missed the breth
ren or did but- little" hurt. Now\ after
some while, the man called "master"
spoke through his lieutenant, and cer
tain of them ran Into the thorn thicket,
and thence appear- d again bearing the
long oars of the b>at.
"Their counsel i. to batter us down
with the oats. Whst shall we do now,
brother?" asked Godwin..
"What we tan," answered Wulf- "It
matters littie if Rosamund is spared
by the waters, for they will scarcely
take her now, who must io-ise the boat
and man it after we are dead."
As he spoke Wulf hear a a sound
behind him, and of a sudden Godwin
threw up his hands and sank to his
knees. Round tie fprang. and there
upon his feet stood that man whom
they had thought dead, and in his
hand a bloody sword. At him leaped
Wulf, and so fierce v.ere the blows he
smote that the first swept through his
sword arm and th< second shore
through cloak and mall deep into the
thief's side; so that :his time he fell,
never to stir again. Then he looker! at
his brother and saw that the blood
van running down hi face and blind
ing him.
"Save yourself, Wulf, for 'I am
sped," murmured "iodwln. â¢
"Nay, or you could not speak." And
be cast his arm round him and kissed
hfiK on the brow.
Then a thought came Into his mind,
and lifting Godwin as though he were
a child, he ran back to where the
i horses stood and heaved him Into the
saddle.
"Hold fast!" he cried, "by mane and
pommel. Keep your mind and hold
fast and I will save you yet."
Then, passing the reins over his left
arm. Wulf leaped upon the back of
his own horse and turned it. Ten sec
onds more and the pirates, whf were
gathering With the oars wheJe the
paths Joined at the root of the cause
way, saw the two great horses thun
dering down upon them, on one a sore
wounded man. his bright hilr dabbled
with blood, hia hands gripping mane
and saddle, and on the other the war
1 . ;
rior,- Wulf, with starting eyes and a
. face-like the .face 'of a flame, shak
ing his red sword, and for the second
â¢ tune that <iay shouting aloud: "A
D'Arcy! a D'Arcy!" Contce. D'Arcy,
Centre Mort!" *â¢.â¢'.
They saw, they shouted, they
massed themselves together arid held
up the' oars to. meet them. 'But Wulf.
spurred fiercely, and-, short as was the
â¢ way, the hsavy horses, trained to tur
ney. gathered their, speed. .Now they
wore on them and the oafs were swept
aside like, reeds and all round them
flashed the swords, rind "VVulf â  felt
that he. was hurt, he knew not, where.
But his sword "flashed also, one blow-;â
thei'e was no time for moreâyet the .
man beneath it sank like an empty
sack.
'By. St. poier! They, were through,
and Godwin still swayed ; Upon the
saddle,- and- yonder,'nearing the'fur
ther shore* the gray horse with its bur
den still battled in the tide. They
wero through! they were â¢ through!
while to Wulf3 eyes- the atr swam red
and the earth seemed as- though it
rose up to meet them and everywhere
â¢ wns-flaming red: â¢â¢'
â¢ ,But the shouts had died .away behind
; them, and the only sound was the
sottnd. of the galloping of their horses*
hoofs'.. Then that also grew' faint and
died away, and silence and darkness
felt'vpon'the mind of Wulf.
C'HAITKR . If.
Sir Andrew D'Arcy.
, God win dreamed ; that he was dead
aiid that beneath him floated {he world,
a- glowing ball, while he was borne'to
and fro through the blackness stretched
upon' a. coych of ebony. There were
bright watchers by his* couch also,
watchers twain, end he knew them for
bin guardian angels,.given him at birth.
Moreover., now â¢ and again presences
would come and ask questions of the
watchers who sat at his head and foot.
One asked:. '.
"Has this soul:sinned?" and the an
gel at his head answered: /
"It has sinned."
Again the voice asked: â¢ "Did it die
â¢ shriven of its sins?"
.The angel answered: "It died un
shriveo, red sword-. aloft, fighting a
good light." â¢ â¢
"Fighting for the cross of Christ?"
.."Nay:, fighting for a woman."
' Alas! poor soul, sinful and unshriyen,
who died -fighting for a woman's love.
Htrw shall such, a one find mercy?"
wailed the: questioning voice, growing
ever fainter, till it was lost far, far
away.
Now came another visitor.. It was
his fatherâthe warrior sire whom he
had never seen, who fell in Syria. He
knew him we'll,' for the face was the
face carven on the tomb in Stangate
church and he wore the blood-red cross
upon, his mail and the D'Arcy death's
hand was on his shield and in his hand
shone a naked sword.
"Is-'this the soul of my son?" he ask
ed of the white-robed watchers. "And
how died he?"
Then the angel at his foot answered:
"He died, red sword, aloft, fighting a
good fight."
"Fighting for the cross of Christ:
"-Nay; fighting for a woman."
"Fighting for a" woman's love who
should have, fallen in the holy war?
Alas! poor son; alas! poor son! Alas!
that We must part again forever!" And
his voice, too, -passed away.
Lo! a glory â¢ advanced through the
blackness and the angels at head and
foot stood up and saluted with their
filming spears.
â¢ "How died this child of God?" asked
a voice., speaking put", of the .glory, a
low' arid awful voice.
"Be" died by the.swo.rd," answered
the angel.
"By the- sword of the children of th?
enemy, fighting in the war of hea
ven?"
And the angels were silent.
"What has heaven, to do .with him,
if he fought not for-heaven?" asked the
voice again.
"Let him be spared," .pleaded {he
guardians, "Who" was young and brave
and knew not. Send, him back to ear,th,
there to retrieve his sins and be out
charge once more."
"So be it," said thÂ° voice. "Knight,
live on, but live.as a knight of heaven
if thou wouldst wfn heaven."
: "Mdst he then put the' woman from
him?" asked the angel's,
â¢'lt-was not said." answered the voice
speaking from the glory. And all the
wild vision vanished.
Then a space of oblivion, and God
win.awoke to hear other voices around
â¢ him, voices human, well-beloved, re
membered; and to see a face bending
over - himâa face most human, most
well-beloved, most, rememberedâthat
of his-cousin, the iiady Rosamund. He
babbled some questions, but they
"brought .him food,, and told him to
sleep, so he' slept. Thus it went on,
waking and slc-p, sleep and waking,
until at length one morning he woke
up truly in the little mom that opened
out "of the solar or sitting place of the
Hail of Steeple, where he and Wulf
had slept since their uncle took them
to-his home as infants. More, on the
trestle bed opposite to him. his legs
and arm bandaged, and. a crutch by
his side, sat Wulf himself. Somewhat
paler and thinner than "of yore, but the
fame- jovial," careless, yet at times
fierce-faced Wulf.
"Do I still dreaKv, my brother, or is
it you indeed?"
A happy smile spread upon the face
of Wulf, lor now he knew, that Godwin,
was himself again.
. "Me sure' enough," he â¢ answered.
"Dream folks, don't have lame legs;
they are the gifts of swords and men."
"And Rosamund? What of Rosa
mund? Did the gray horse swim the
creek, and how came we here? Tell
me quickâl faint for news."
"Herself shall tell you." And hob
bling to the curtained door, he called.
"Rosamund . myâmy, ourâLady
Rosamund, Godwin is himself again.
Hear you, Godwin is himself again, and
would speak with you!"
There was a swift rustle of robes and
a sound of quick feet among the rushes
that strewed the floor, and thenâRosa
mund herself, lovely as ever, but all
her statellness forgot in Joy. She sa.v
how the gaunt Godwin sitting up upon
the pallet, his gray eyes shining in the
white and sunken face. For Godwin's
eyes were gray, while Wulf's were blue,
which was the only difference between
them whereof a stranger would take
note. aPhough in truth Wulf's lips
were fuller than Godwin's, and his chin
more marked: also he was a larger
man. She saw him, and with a little
cry of delight ran and cast her arms
about him, and kissed him on the
brow.
"Be careful," said Wulf roughly,
turning his head aside, "or, Rosa
mund, you will loose the bandages, and
bring his trouble back again; he has
h?d enough of blood-letting."
"Then I will kiss him on the handâ
the hand that saved me," .she said, and
<Jid so. More, she pressed that poor,
l>ale hand against her heart.
"Mine had something to do with
that business also, but I don't remem
ber that yoÂ» kissed It, Rosamund.
Well, I will kiss him too, and oh! God
be praised, and the holy Virgin, and
the holy Peter, and the holy Chad,
and all the other holy dead folk whose
names I can't recall, who between
them, with the help of Rosamund
her,?, and the prayers of the Prior
John and brethren at Stangate, and
of Matthew, the village priest, have
given you oack to us, my brother, my
most beloved brother." And he
hopped to the beside, and threw his
iong, sinewy arms about Godwin and
embraced him again and again.
"Be careful," said Rosamund, dri
ly, "or, Wulf, you will disturb the
bandages, and he has had enough of
blood-letting."
Then before he could answer, which
he seemed minded to do, there came
the sound of a slow step, and swing
ing the curtain aside, a tall and noble
looking knight entered the little place.
The man was old, but looked older
than he was, for sorrow and sickness
had wasted him. His snow-white hair
hung upon his shoulders, his face was
pale, and his features were pinched
but finely chiseled, and notwithstand
ing the- difference of their years, won
derfully like to those-of the daughter
Rosamund. For* this, was her father,
the famous Lord.. Sir' Andrew D'Arcy.
Rosamund -turned' and bent the knee
to him with a strange and Eastern
grace, while Wulf bo\ved : his head, and
Godwin, since his nock was too stiff
to stir.. held up-his hand in greeting.
'.The old man looked at . him, . and
.there' was pride in his eye.
... "So you .will live after all, my
nephew," he said, "and for that I
thank the Giver of life and death,
since 'fore God you are a gallant man
âa worthy child of the bloods of the
Norman D'Arcy and of Uluin the
Saxon. Yes, one of the best of them."
"Speak not so. my uncle," said
Godwin; "or at least, here is a worth
ier." and he patted the hand of Wulf
with his lean fingers. "Wulf it was
who bore me through. Oh, I remem
ber as much as thatâhow he lifted
me onto the black horse and bade me
to cling fast to mane and pommel.
Aye", and I remember the
his cry of 'Contre D'Arcy, contre
Mort!" and the flashing of swords
about us, and after that ânothing."
"Would that I had been there to
share that fight." said the Lord D'Arcy,
tossing his white hair. "Oh, my chil
dren, it is hard to be sick and old and
to feel that never again may the an
cient cry pass mv lips, and never
again shall I lift brand in battle. A
log am Iânothing but a rotten log.
Still, had .1 known, had I only
known "
"Father, father," said Rosamund,
casting her white arm about his neck.
"You should not speak thus. You have
done your share."
"Yes, my share; but I should like to
do more. Oh, St. Andrew, grant it to
me to die with my sword aloft and my
grandsire's cry upon mv Hps. Yes,
yes; thus, not like a worn-out war
horse In his stall. There, pardon me;
but In truth, my children, I am jeal
ous of you. Why, when I found you ly
ing in each other's arms I could have
wept for rage to think that such a fray
had been within a league of my own i
doors and I not in It."
"I know nothing of all that story,"
said Godwin. â¢
"No, in truth, how can you, who have :
been senseless this month or more?
But Rosamund knows, and she shall :
tell it you. Speak on, Rosamund. Lay
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
you back, Godwin, and listen."
"The tale is yours, my cousins, and
not mine," said Rosamund. "You bade
me take the water, and into it I
spurred the gray horse, and we sank
deep, so that the waves closed above
my head. Then up We came, I floating
from the saddle, but I regained it, and
the horse answered to my voice and
bridle, and swam out for the farther
shore. On It swam, somewhat slant
wise with the tide, so that by turning
my head .1 could see all that passed
upon the mole. I saw them come at
you, and men fall before your swords;
I saw you charge them, and run back
again, and, lastly,- after what seemed a
very long while, and I was far away,
Z saw Wulf lift Godwin into the sad
dleâl knew It jriust be Godwin, be
cause he set him ou the black horseâ
and the pair of you galloped down the
quay and vanished. By then X was not
a hundred yards from the home shore,
and the gray grew very weary and
sank deep in the water. But I cheered
it on with my voice, and although
twice its head went beneath the waves,
in the end it found a footing, though
a soft one. After resting awhile, it
plunged forward with short rushes
through the mud, and so at length
came safe to land, where it stood
shaking with fear and weariness. So
soon as the horse got its breath again
I pressed forward, and came home here
as the dark closed in, to meet your un
cle watching for me at the gateâand
now, father, do you take up the tale."
"There is little more to tell," said Sir>
Andrew. "You will remember, nephewÂ»,
that I was against this ride of Rosa
mund's to seek flowers, or I know not
what, at St. Peter's shrine, nine miles
away, but as the maid had set her
heart on it and there are but few
pleasures here, why. I let her go with
the pair of ycu for escort. You will
mind also that you were starting with
out your mail, and how foolish you
thought me when I called you back
and made you gird it on. Well, my
patron saintâor yoursâput it into my
head to do so. for had it not been for
those same shirts of mall you were
both of you dead men to-day. But that
morning I had been thinking of Sir
Hugh Lozelleâif such a false pirate
rogue can be called a knight, not but
that he is stout and brave enoughâand
his threats after he recovered from the
wound you gave him, Godwin, how
that he would come back and take
your cousin for all we could do to stay
him. True, we have heard that he had
sailed for the East to war against Sala
dinâor with him, for he was ever a
traitor âbut even if this were so, men
return from the East. Therefore I bade
you arm, having some foresight of what
was to come, for doubtless this on
slaught must have been planned by
him."
"I think so." said Wulf, "for, as
Rosamund here knows, the tall knave
who interpreted for the foreigner whom
he called his master gave us the name
of the Knight Lozelle as the man who
sought to carry her off."
"Was this master a Saracen?" asked
Sir Andrew anxiously.
"Nay, uncle, how can I tell, seeing
that his face was masked like the reÃt
and he spoke through an interpreter?
But I pray you go on with the story,
which Godwin has not heard."
"It is short. When Rosamund told
her tale, whereof I could make littleâ
for the girl was crazed with grief and
cold and fearâsave that you had been
attacked upon the old quay, and she
had escaped by swimming Death
Creek, whieft seemed a thins Incredi
ble. I got together what , men I could.
Then, bidding; her stay behind and
nurse herself, which she was loth to
do, I set out to find you or your bodies.
It was dark, but we rode hard, having
lanterns with us, as we went rousing
men at every stead, until we came to
where the roads Join at Moats. There
we found a black horse âyour horse,
Godwinâso sorely wounded that he
could travel no farther, and I groaned,
thinking that you were dead. Still we
went on, till we heard another horse
whinny, and presently found the roan,
also riderless, standing by the path
side with his head down.
" 'A mat. on the ground holds him!'
cried one, and I sprang from the sad
dle to see wl o it might be, to find that
v it was you, the pair of you, locked In
each other's arms, and senseless, if not
dead, as well you might be from your
wounds. I bade the country folk cover
you up and carry you homo, and others
to run to Stangate and pray the prior
and the monk Stephen, who is a leech,
come with speed to tend you, while we
pressed onward to take vengeance if
we might. We reached the quay upon
the creek, but there we found nothing
save ' some blood stains and âthis is
strangeâyour sword, Godwin, the hilt
set between two stones, and on the
point a writing."
"What was the writing?" asked God
win.
"Here it is." answered the uncle,
drawing a piece of parchment from his
robe. Read it, one of you, since all of
you are scholars and my eyes are bad."
Rosamund took it and read what was
written hurriedly, but in a clerkly
hand, and in the French tongue. It ran
thus: "The sword of a brave man.
Bury it with htm if he be dead, and
give it back to him if he lives,as I
hope. My master would wish me to do
this honor to a gallant foe, whom in
that case he still may meet. (Signed)
Hugh Lozelle, or Another.""
"Another, then; not Hugh Lozelle,"
said Godwin, "since be cannot write.
and if he-could, would never pen words
so knightly." *
"The. words may be knightly, but the
writer's. deeds were base enough," re
plied Sir Andrew; "nor, of a truth, do
I understand this scroll."
"The. interpreter spoke of the short
man as his master," suggested Wulf.
"Aye,"nephew; but him you met. This
writing speaks of a master whom God
win may meet, and who would wish the
writer to pay him a certain honor."
"Perhaps he wrote thus to blind us."
"Perchance, perchance. The matter
puzzles me. Moreover, of whom these
men were I have been able to learn
nothing. A boat was seen passing
toward Bradwellâindeed. It seems that
you saw It, and that night a boat was
seen sailing southward down St Pet
er's sands toward a ship that had an
chored off Foulness Point. But what
that *shlp was, whence she came and
whither she went, none knew, though
the..tidings of this fray have made
some stir."
"Well." said Wulf. "at the least we
haw seen the last of her crew-of
women-thieves. Had they meant more
mischief they would have shown them
selves agsin here now."
Sir. Andrew, looked grave at he an
swered.
"So . I trust, hut all the tale Is very
strange. How came It that they knew
that you and Rosamund were rldtag
that day to st.-Peter*s.en-the-Wall and
so were able to waylay you? Surely
some spy must have warned them,
since that they wÂ«re no common pi
rates is evident, for they spoke of Lo
zelle and bade you two begone un
harmed, as It was Rosamund whom
they needed. Also, there Is the matter
of the sword that fell from the hand
a( Godwin when he was hurt, which
was returned In so strange a fashion.
I have known many such deeds of
chivalry done In the East by Paynlm
menâ" t
"Well, Rosamund Is half an East
ern," broke In Wulf carelessly; "and
perhaps'that had something to do with
it all.".
Sir Andrew started and the color rose
to his pale face. Then In a tone in
which he showed he wished to speai; no
more of this matter, he said:
"Enough, enough. Godwin Is very
weak and grows weary and before Z
leave htm I have a word to say that
it may please you both to hear. Young
men. you" are of my blood, the nearest
to it save this maidâthe sons of that
noble knight, my brother. I have ever
loved you well and been proud of you,
hut If this was so In the past. how
much more Is It thus to-day when you
have done such high service to my
house? Moreover, that deed was brave
and great: nothing more knightly has
been told of In Essex this many a year
and those who wrought It should no
longer be simple gentlemen, but very
knights. This boon it Is in my power
to grant to you according to the an
cient custom. Still, that none may
question it. while you lay sick, but
after it was believed that â¢ Godwin
would live, which at first we scarcely
dared to hope, I journeyed to London
and sought audience of our Uege the
King. Having told him this tale, I
prayed him that he would be pleased
to tyrant me his command In writing
that I should name you knights. My
nephews, he was so- pleased, and here
I have the brief sealed with the royal
signet, commanding that in his name
and my own I should give you the ac
colade publicly In the church of the
priory at Stangate at such season as
may be convenient. Therefore, God
win, the squire, haste you to get well,
that you may. become Sir Godwin, the
knight; for you. Wulf. save for the -
hurt to your lei*, are already well
enough."
Now Godwin's white face went red
with pride, and Wulf dropped his bold
eyes and looked modest as a girl.
"Speak you," he said to his broth
er, "for my tongue Is blunt and awk
ward."
"Sir." said Godwin in a weak voice,
"we know not how to thank you for so
great an honor, that we never thought
to win till we had done more famous
deeds than the beating off of a band
of robbers. Sir. we have no more to
say, save that while we live we will
strive to be worthy of our name and
ofyyou."
"Welt said." said his uncle, adding
as though speaking to himself, "this
man Is courtly as he Is brave."
Wulf looked up. a flash of merriment
upon his open face.
"I, my uncle, whose speech H, I fear
me, not courtly, thank you also. I
will add that I think our lady cousin
here should be knighted too. If such a
thing were possible for a woman, see
ing that to swim a horse across Death
Creek was a greater deed than to fight
some rascals on Its quay."
"Rosamund?" answered the old man
in the same dreamy voice. "Her rank Is
high enoughâtoo high, too high for.
safety." And turning, he left the little
chamber.
"Well, cousin," said Wulf, "if you
cannot be a knight, at least you can
lessen all this dangerous rank of yours
by becoming a knight's wife." Where
at Rosamund looked at him with in
dignation which struggled with a Smile
in her dark eyes, and murmuring that
she would see to the making of God
win's broth, followed her father from
the place.
"It would have been kinder had she
told us that she was glad," said Wulf
when she was gone
"Perhaps she â¢ would," answered his
brother, "had it not been for your
rough jests, Wulf. which might have a
meaning in them."
"Nay, I had no meaning. Why should
she not become a knight's wife?"
"Aye, but what knight's? Would It
please either of us, brother, if, as may
well hap, he should chance to be some
stranger?"
Now Wulf swore a great oath, then
flushed to the roots of his fair hair,
and was silent.
"Ah!" said Godwin; "you do not
think before you speak, which it is al
ways well to do."
"She swore upon the quay yonder,"
broke in Wulf.
"Never speak of what she swore.
Words uttered in such an hour should
not be remembered against a maid."
"God's truth, brother, you are right,
as ever! My tongue runs away with
me, bat still I can't forget those words,
though which of usâ"
"Wulf!"
"I mean to say that we are in For
tune's path to-day, Godwin. Oh. that
was a lucky ride! Such fighting as I
have never seen or dreamed of. And
we won it, too! And now both of us
are alive, and a knighthood for each!"
"Yes, both of us alive, thanks to
you, Wulfânay. It is so, though you
would never have done less. But as
for Fortune's path. It is one that has
many rough turns, and perhaps before
all is done she. may lead us down some
of them."
"You talk like a priest, not like a
squire who is to be knighted at the cost
of a scar on his head. For my part
I will kiss Fortune while I may, and
if she Jilts me afterward " N
"Wulf." called Rosamund from With
out the curtain, "cease talking of kiss
ing at the top of your voice. I pray
you, and leave Godwin to sleep, for he
needs it." And she entered the little
chamber, bearing a bowl of broth In
her hand.
Thereon, saying that ladies should
not listen to what did not concern
them, Wulf seised his crutch and hob
bled from the place.
CHAPTER in.
The Knighting of the Brethren.
Another month had gone by, and
though Godwin was still somewhat
weak and suffered from headache at
times, the brethren had recovered
from their wounds. On the last day
of November, about 2 o'clock in the
afternoon, a great procession might
have been seen wending- its way from
the old hall at Steeple. In it were
many knights fully armed, before
whom were borne their banners. These
went first. Then came , old Sir An
drew D'Arcy. also fully armed, at
tended by squires and retainers. He
was accompanied by his lovely daugh
ter, the Lady Rosamund, clad in
beautiful apparel under her cloak of
fur, who rode upon his right hand on
that same horse that had swam Death
Creek. Next appeared the brethren,
modestly arrayed as simple gentle
men, followed each of them by his
squire, scions of the noble houses of
Salcote and of Dengie. After them
rode yet more knights, squires, ten
ants of various degrees, servants, and,
lastly, a great number of peasantry
and vileins, who walked and ran with
their women folk and children.
Following 'he road through the vil
lage, the procession turned to the left
at the great arch which marked the
boundary of the monks lands, and
headed for Stangate Abbey, some two
miles away, by the path that ran be
tween the arable land and the SaU
marshes, which are flooded at high
tide. At length they came to the
stone sate of the abbey, that gave the
place its name of Stangate Here
they were met by a company of the
Clunlac monks, who dwelt In this wild
and lonely place upon the water's
edge, headed by their prior. John a
descendant of the founder. Radulf
Fttx Brien. He was a venerable
white-haired man. clad in his wide
sleeved black robe, and preceded by a
priest carrying a silver cross. Now
the procession separated. Godwin and
Wolf, with certain of the knights and
their esquires, being led to the Priory,
white the main body of it entered tho
church, or stood about outside ts
door.
Arrived in the house, the two knights
elect were taken to a room wherr
their hair was cut and their chins were
shaved by a barber who awaited them
Then, under the guidance of two old
knights named Sir Anthony de Mande
vllle and Sir Roger de Merc!, they
were conducted to baths surrounded by
rich cloths. Into these, having been
undressed by the squires, they entered
and bathed themselves, while sir An
thony and. Sir Roger spoke to them
through the cloths of the high duties
of their vocation., ending by pour ink*
water over them, and signing their
bodies with the sign of the Cross, Next
they were dressed again, and preceded
by minstrels. led to the church, at tho
porch of which they and their suutres
were given wine to drink.
Here, in the presence of all the com
pany, they were clothed first in white
tunics, to signify the whiteness of their
hearts; next In red robes, symbolical
of the blood they might be called upon
to shed for Christ; and lastly. In long
black cloaks, emblems of the death that,
must be endured by all. This done,
their armor was brought and piled he
fore them upon the steps of the altar,
and the congregation departed. home
ward, leaving them with their esquires
and the priest to spend the long win*
ter. night "in orisons and Dravera."
Long. Indeed, it was. in that lone
some, holy place, lit only by a lamp
Which' swung before the altar. Wulf
praye* and prayed until he could pray
no more, then fell into a half dreamful
state that was haunted by the fare of
Rosamund, where even hir face should
have been forgotten. Godwin, his el*
bow resting against the tomb that hid
Ms father's heart, prayed also, until
even his earnestness was outworn, and
he began to wonder about many thlnga.
That dream of his, for Instance, in his
sickness, when he had seemed to be
dead, and what might be the true duty
of man. To be brave and UDrisrht?
Surely. To fight for the Cross of Christ
against the Saracen? Surely. If the
chance came his way. What mor<Â«* Tv
abandon the world and to spent' hi*
life muttering prayers like those nnests
in the darkness behtnd htm? Could 'hat
be needful or of service to God or man? >
To man. perhaps, because such folk
tended the sick and fed the poor. But
to God? Was be not sent Into the world
to bear his part in the worldâto live
his full life* This would mean a half-
Ufeâone into which no woman could
enter, to which ,no child might be add
ed, since to monks and even to certain
brotherhoods, all these things, which
Nature decreed and Heaven had sanc
tified, were deadly sin.
It would mean, for instance, that
he must think no more of Rosamund.
Could he do this for the sake of the
welfare of his soul in some future
state? Why, at the thought of it, %
even there and then, in the solemn
place and hour of dedication, his
spirit reeled, for then and there for
the first time it was borne in upon
him that he loved this woman more
than all the world besideâmore than
his life, more, perhaps, than his soul.
He loved her with all his pure, young
heartâso much that it would be a joy
for him to die for her, not only in the
heat of battle, as lately had almost
chanced on the Death Creek quay, but
in cold blood of set purpose if there
were need. He loved her with body
and with spirit, and, after God, here
to her he consecrated his body and ,
his spirit. Rut what value would she
put upon the gift? What if some
other man?
By his side, his elbows resting on
the altar rails, his eyes fixed upon the
beaming armor that he would wear
in battle, knelt Wulf, his brotherâ
a mighty man, a knight of knights,
fearless, noble, open-hearted; such a
one as any woman might well love.
And he also loved Rosamund. Of this
he was sure. And, oh! did not Rosa
mund love him? Bitter jealousy
seized upon Godwin's vitals. Yes; even
then and there black envy got a hold
of him and rent him so sore that, cold
as was the place, the sweat poured
from his brow and body.
"Oh, God," he moaned in his poor
heart, "give, me strength to fight
against this sinful passion that would
lead me to hate the brother whom I
love. O God, give me strength to bear
it If he should be preferred before
me. Make me a perfect knightââ¢
strong to suffer and endure, and, If
need be, to rejoice even in the Joy of
my supplanter."
Should be abandon hope? Should
he fly the battle for fear he might be i
defeated? Nay; he would fight on in 4
all honesty and honor, and If he were m
overcome would meet his fate as a
brave knight oughtâwithout bitter-ffi
ness, but without shame. Let destiny
direct the matter. It was in the hands "
of destiny, and stretching out his arm.
be threw it around the neck of his
brother, who knelt before him, And'
let It rest there, until the head of the
tired Wulf sank sleepily upon his'
shoulder like the head of an infant
upon its mother's breast.
At length the gray dawn broke, and
the sunlight, passing through the
eastern window, like a golden spear,
pierced the dusk of the long church,
which was built to the shape of a
cross, so that only its trancepts re
mained in the shadow. Then came a
sound of chanting, and by the western
door entered the Prior, wearing all his
robes, attended by the monks and aco
lytes, who swung censers. In the cen
ter of the nave he halted and passed
to the confessional, calling on Godwin
to follow. So he went and knelt be
fore the holy man and there poured
out ail his heart. He confessed his
ting. They were but few. He told
him of the vision of his sickness, on
which the Prior pondered long; of his
deep love, his hopes, his fears and
his desire to be a warrior who once as a
lad had wished to be a monk, not that
he might shed blood, but to fight for
the cross of Christ against the Pay
nim. ending with a cry of:
"Give me counsel; O, my father,
give me counsel."
"Your own heart is your best coun
selor," was the priest's answer. "Go
as It guides you, knowing that through
it it Is God who guides. Nor fearthat you will fail. But if love and
the joys of fife should, leave you, then
come back and we will talk again.
Go on. pure knight of Christ, fearing
nothing and sure of the reward, and
take with you the blessing of Christ
and of hfs church."
"What penance mUst I bear,
father?"
"Such, souls as yours inflict their
own penance. The saints forbid that
1-should add to it," was the gentle an
swer.
Then with a lightened- heart God
win returned to -the altar rails, while
his brother Wulf was summoned to
take his place in the confessional. Of
the sins that he -had to tell we need
not speak. They were such as were
common- to young men and none of
them very grievous. Still, before he
gave him absolution, the good Prior
admonished him to think, less of his
body and more of his spirit; less,
of the glory of the feats of arms
and more to the true ends to which
he should enter on them. He bade
him, moreover, to take his brother
Godwin as an earthly guide and ex
ample, since there lived no better or
wiser man of his years, and finally dis
missed him, prophesying that if he
would heed these counsels he would
come to- great glory on earth and in
heaven.
"Father, I will do my best," an
swered Wulf humbly, "but there can
not be two Godwins, and, father, some
times I fear me that our paths will
cross, since two men cannot win one
woman." .
"I know the trouble;" answered the
â¢Prior anxiously, "and with less noble
natured men it might be grave. But
if it should come to this, then must
the lady judge according to the wishes
o;' her own heart, and. he who loses
her mus.t be loyal in sorrow as in joy.
But .be sure you take no base advan
tage of your brother in the hour, of
temptation and bear him no bitterness
should he win the bride."
"I. think I can be sure of that,"
said Wulf: "also that we, who have
loved each other from birth, would
â die before we betrayed each other."
"I think so also," answered the Prior,
"but Satan is very strong."
Then Wulf also returned to the altar
rails, and the full mass was sung, and
the sacrament received by the two
neophytes, and the offerings made all
in their appointed order. Next they
' were led back to the priory to rest and
to eat a little after their long night's
vigil in the .cold church, and here they
abode ; awhile, thinking their own.
thoughts, seated alone in the Prior's
chamber. At length Wulf, who seemed
to be ill at ease, rose and laid his hand
upon his brother's shoulder, saying:
"I-can be silent no more; it was ever
thus: that which is in my mind must
out of it. I have words to say to you."
"Speak on, Wulf," said Godwin.
..Wulf'sat himself down again on his
stool, and for a while stared hard at
nothing, for he did not seem to find it
easy to begin .this talk. Now Godwin
could read hie brother's mind like a
book, but Wulf could not always read
Godwin's, although, being twins who
who had been together from birth,
their hearts were for the most part
open to each other without the need of
words.
"It is of our cousin Rosamund, is it
not?" asked Godwin presently.
"Aye. Who else?" <
"And you would tell â me that you
love her, and .that now you are a
knightâalmostâand hard on flve-and
twenty years of age, you would ask her
to become your affianced wife?"
"Yes; it came into my heart when
she rode the gray horse into the water,
there upon the pier, and I thought that
I should never see her any more. I say
that it came into my. heart that life
was not worth living nor death worth
dying without her."
"Then. Wulf," answered Godwin
slowly,- "what more is there to say?
Ask on, and prosper. Why not? We
have some lands, if not many, and
Rosamund will'not lack for them; nor
do I think that our uncle would say
you nay, if she wills it, seeing that you
are the properest man and the bravest
in all this country side.''
"Except my brother Godwin, who is
all these things, and gdod and learned
to boot, which I am pot," replied Wulf
musingly. Then there was silence for
a while, which he broke.
"Godwin, our ill-luck is that you love
her also, and that you thought the
same thought that I did yonder on the
quay-head."
Godwin flushed a little and his long
fingers tightened' their grip upon his
knee. .
"It is so," he said qUietly. "To my
grief it is so. But she knows nothing
of this, and should never know it if you
will keep a watch upon your tongue.
Moreover, you need not be Jealous of
me. before marriage or after.'
â¢â¢What, then,, would you have me
do?" asked Wulf hotly. "Seek her
heart, and perchanceâthough this I
doubtâlet her yield It to me. she think
ing that you care naught for her?"
"Why not?" asked Godwin again,
with a sigh; "it might save her some
pain and you. some- doubt, and make
your own path more clear. A marriage
is more to you than to me, Wulf, who
think -sometimes that my sword shall
be my spouse and duty my only
crown."
"Who think, having a heart of gold,
that even in such a thing as this you
will not bar the path of the brother
whom you love. Nay, Godwin, as I am a
sinful man. and as I desire her above
al! things on earth, I will play no such
coward's game, nor conquer one who
will not lift his sword lest he should
hurt me. Sooner would I bid you all
farewell, and go to seek fortune or
death 'in the wars without â¢ work
spoken."
"Leaving her to pine, perchance. Oh,
could we be sure that she had no mind
toward either of us, that would be best
âto begone together. But, Wulf, we
cannot be sure, since at times, to be
honest, I have thought she loves you."
"And at times, to be honest, I have
been sure that she loves you, although
I should like to try my luck and hear it
from her Hps, which on such terms I
will not do."
"What, then, is your plan, Wulf?"
"My plan is that if our uncle gives us
leave, we should both speak to herâ
you first, as the eldest, setting out your
case as best you can, and asking her to
think of it and give you answer within
a day. Then, before that day is done I
also should speak, so that she may
know all the story,, and play her part
In it with opened eyes, not deeming, as
otherwise she might, that we know
each other's minds, and that you ask
because I have no will that way."
"It is very fair." said Godwin, "and
worthy of you, who are the most hon
est of men. Yet Wulf, my heart is
troubled. See you, my brother, have
ever brethren loved each other as we
do? And now must the shadow of a
woman fall upon that love and blight
it, that is so fair and precious a
thing?"
"Why so?" asked Wulf. "Though it
is the common thought, I think it un
needful that even this should sour our
great love. Come, Godwin, let us make
a pact that it shall not be thus, and
keep it by the help of heaven. Let us
show the world that two men can love
one woman and still love each other,
not knowing as yet which of them she
will choose âif, indeed, she chooses
either; for, Godwin, we are not the only
gentlemen in the world whose eyes
have turned, or yet may turn, toward
the high-born, rioh and lovely Lady
Rosamund. Is it your will that we
shall make such a pact?"
Godwin thought a little, then an
swered:
"Yes; but if so it must be one so
strong that for her sake and for both
our sakes we cannot break it and live
with honor."
"So be it," said Wulf. "This is man's
work, not child's make believe."
Then Godwin rose and going to the
door bade his squire, who watched
without, pray the Prior John to come
to them, as they sought his counsel in
a matter. So he came, and standing
before him with downcast head, God
win told him all the tale, which, indeed,
he who knew so much already was
quick to understand, and of their pur
pose also; while at a question from the
prior Wulf answered that it was well
and truly said, nothing having been
kept back. Then they asked him if it
was lawful that they should take such
an oath, to which he replied that he
thought it not only lawful, but very
good.
So In the end. kneeling together hand
in hand before the holy rood that stood
in the chamber, they repeated this oath
after him. both of them together:
"We brethren, Godwin and Wulf
D'Arcy, do solemnly swear by the holy
cross of Christ and by the patron saint
of this place, St. Mary Magdalene, and
our patron saints, St. Peter and St.
Chad, standing In the presence of God.
our guardian angels, and of you. John,
that being both of. us enamored of our
cousin, Rosamund D'Arcy, we will, if
her sire allows It, ask her to wife in
the manner we have agreed, and no
other. That we will abide by her will,
should she choose either of us. nor
seek to alter it by tempting her from
her troth, or In any fashion overt or
covert. That he of us whom she re
fuses will thenceforth be a brother to
her and no more, however Satan may
tempt his heart otherwise. That so far
as may be possible to us, who are but
sinful men. we will suffer no bitterness
nor jealousy to come between our love
because of this woman, and that in
war or peace we will remain faithful
comrades and brethren. And so we
swear with a true heart and purpose,
and in token thereof, knowing that he
who breaks this oath will be a knight
dishonored and a vessel fit for the
wrath of God, we kiss this rood and
one another."
This, then, they said and did. and
with light minds and joyful faces re
ceived the blessing of the Prior, who
had christened them in Infancy, and
went down to meet the great company
that had ridden forth to lead them
back to Steeple, where their knighting
should be done.
So to Steeple, preceded by the
squires, who rode before them bare
headed, carrying their swords by
their scabbarded pints, with the gold
spurs hangin from the hilts, they
came at last. Here the' hall was set
for a great feast, a space having been
left ! between the tables and the dais,
to which the brethren wera conducted.
Then came forward Sir Anthony de
Mandeville and Sir Roger de Merci
in full armour, and presented to Sir
Andrew D'Arcy, their uncle, who
stood upon the edge of the dais, also
in his armour, their swords and spurs,
.of which he* gave back to them the
latter, bidding them affix them : upon
the candidates' right heels. This
done, the Prior John blessed the
swords, after which Sir Andrew girded
them about the waists of his nephews,
saying:
"Take ye back the swords that you
have used so well."
Next he drew his wn silyer-hilted
blade that had been his father's and
his grandfather's, and whilst they
knelt before him, smote each of them
three blows upon the right shoulder,
crying with a loud voice: "In the
name of God, Saint Michael and Saint
George I knight ye. Be ye good
knights." Thereafter came forward
Rosamund as their nearest kinswom
an, and, helped by other ladies, clad
upon them their hauberks, or coats of
mail, their helms of steel, and their
kite-shaped shields, emblazoned with
* a skull, the cognizance of their race.
This done, with the musicians march
ing before them, they walked to
Steeple Church, a distance of 200
paces from the hall, where they laid
their swords upon the altar and took
them up again, swearing to be good
servants of Christ and defenders of
the church. As they left its doors
who should meet them but the cook,
carrying his chopper in his hand and
claiming as his fee the value of the
spurs they wore, crying aloud at the
same time:
"If either of you young knights
should do aught In despite of your
honor and of the oaths that you have
swornâfrom which may God and his
saints prevent you!âthen with my
chopper will I hack these spurs from
off your heels "
Thus at last the long ceremony was
ended, and after it came a very great
feast, for at the high table were enter
tained many noble knights and ladles,
and below In the hall their squires and
other gentlemen, and outside all the
yeomanry and villagers, while the
children and the aged had food and
drink given to them in the nave of the
church Itself. When the eating at
length was done, the center of the hall
was cleared, and while men drank, the
minstrels made music, for all were very
merry with wine' and strong ale, and
talk arose as to which of these breth
renâSir Godwin and Sir Wulfâwas the
more brave, the more handsome, and
the more learned and courteous.
Now a knight, It was Sir Saurln de
Salcoteâseeing that the argument
grew hot and was like to lead to blows,
rose and declared that this should be
decided by beauty alone, and that none
could be more fitted to judge than the
fair lady whom the two of them had
saved from woman-thieves at the
Death Creek quay. Then all called,
"Aye, let her settle it," and it was
agreed that she would give the ker
chief from her neck to the bravest, a
beaker of wine to the handsomest, and
a book of hours to the most learned.
So, seeing no help for It,
gentle and simple alike, except her
father, the brethren, the most of the
other ladies and herself, Who drank
but water, had begun to grow heated
with wine and were very urgent,
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALH
Rosamund took the silk kerchief from
her neck. Then coming to the edge
of the dais, where they were seated in
the sight of all, she stood before her
cousins, not knowing, poor maid, to
which of them she should offer it. But
Godwin whispered a word to Wulf,
and both of them stretching out their
right hands took an end of the ker
chief which she he'd toward them, and
renting it in twain twisted the severed
fragments round their, sword hilti,
whereat all laughed at their wit and
cried:
"The wine for the handsome. They
cannot serve that thus." '
Rosamund thought a moment; then
she lifted a great silver breaker, the
largest on the board, and having filled
it full of wine once more came for
ward and held it before them as
though pondering. Thereon the
brethren, as though by a single move
ment, bent forward and each of them
touched the beaker with his Hps.
Again a great laugh went up, and
even Rosamund smiled.
"The book! the book!" cried the
company. "They may not tear the
holy book!"
So for the third time Rosamund ad
vanced, bearing the missal.
"Knights," she said, "you have rent
my kerchief and drunk mv wine. Now
I offer this hallowed writingâto him
who can read it best."
"Give it to Godwin," said Wulf. "I
am a swordsman, not a clerk."
"Well said! well said!" roared the
company. "The sword for usânot the
pen!" But Rosamund turned on them
and answered:
"He who wields sword, is brave, and
he who wields pen Is wise, but better
is he who can handle both sword and
penâlike my cousin Godwinâthe brave
and learned."
"Hear her! hear her!" cried the com
pany, knocking their horns upon the
board, while in the silence that fol
lowed a woman's voice said, "Sir God
win's luck is great, but give me Sir
Wulf's strong arms."
Then the drinking began again, and
Rosamund and the laMies slipped away/
as well they mightâfor the times were
rough and coarse.
On the morrow, after most of the
guests were gone, many of them with
aching heads, Godwin and Wulf sought
their uncle, Sir Andrew. In the solar
where he sat alone, for they knew that
Rosamund had walked to the church
hard by with two of the serving
women to make it ready for the Fri
day's mass, after the feast of the peas
ants that had been held in the nave.
Coming to his oaken chair by the open
hearth which had a chimney to itâno
common thing in those daysâthey
kneeled before him.
"What is it now, my nephews?"
asked the old man, smiling. "Do you
wish that I should knight you afresh?"
"Nay, sir," answered Godwin, "we
seek a greater boon."
"Then you sgek In vain, for there is
none."
"Another sort of boon," broke in
Wulf.
Sir Andrew pulled his beard, and
looked at them. Perhaps the Prior
John had spoken a word to him. and
he guessed what was coming.
"Speak," he said to Godwin., "The
gift is great that I would, not give to
either of you. if it be within my power."
"Sir," said Godwin, "we .seek the
leave to ask your daughter's hand in
marriage." '
"What! the two of you?"
"Yes, sir; the two of us."
Then Sir Andrew, who â¢ seldom
laughed, laughed outright.
"Truly," he said, "of all the strange
things I have known, this is the stran
gestâthat two knights should ask one
wife between them."
"It seems strange, sir; but listen to
our tale and you will understand."
So he listened while they told him all
that had passed between them and of
the solemn oath which they had sworn.
"Noble In this as In other things,"
commented Sir Andrew when they had
done: "but I fear that one of you will
find that vow hard to keep. By all the
saints, nephews, you were right when
'you said that you asked a great boon.
Do you know, although I have told you
nothing of it, that, not to speak of the
knave Lozelle, already two of the
greatest men in this land have sought
my daughter Rosamund in marriage."
"It may well be so," said Wulf.
"It is so, and now I will tell you why
one or other of the pair is not her hus
band, which in some ways I would he
were. A simple reason. I asked her,
and she had no mind to either, and as
her mother married where her heart
was, so I have sworn that the daugh
ter should do, or not at allâfor better
a nunnery than a loveless bridal. Now
let us see what you have to give. You
are of good bloodâthat of Ululn by
your mother, and mine, also on one
side her own. As squires to your spon
sors of yesterday, the knights Sir An
thony de Mandevllle nd Sir Roger de
Mercl, you bore you bravely in the
Scottish War: indeed, your liege King
Henry remembered it, and that is why
he granted my prayer so readily. Since
then, although you loved the life lit
tle, because I asked It of you, you have
rested here at home with me, and done
no feats of arms, save that great one
of two months gone which made you
knights, and, in truth, gives you some
claim on Rosamund.
"For the rest, your father being the
younger Bon, your lands are small, and
you have no other gear. Outside the
borders of this shire you are unknown
men, with all your deeds to doâfor I
reckon not those Scottish battles when
you were but boys. And she whom
you ask is one of the fairest and no
blest and most learned ladies In this
land, for I, who have some skill in
such things, have taught her myself
from childhood. Moreover, as I have
no other heir, she will be wealthy.
Well, what more have you to offer for
all this?"
"Ourselves," answered Wulf boldly.
"We are true knights of whom you
know the best and worst, and we love
her. We learned It for once and for
?all on Death Creek quay, for till then
she was our sister and no more."
"Ay," added Godwin, "when she
swore herself to us and blessed us,
then light broke on both."
"Stand up," said Sir Andrew, "and
let me lpok at you."
So they stood side by side in the full
light of the blazing fire, for little other
came through those narrow windows.
"Proper men: proper men;" said the
old 1 knight; "and as like to one an
other as two grains of wheat from the
same sample. Six feet high, each of
you. and broad-chested, though Wulf
Is larger made and the stronger of the
two. Brown and wavlng-haired, both,
save for that line of white where the
sword hit yours, GodwinâGodwin with
gray eyes that dream and Wulf with
the blue eyes that shine like swords.
Ah! your grandsire had eyes like that,
Wulf; and I have been told that when
he leaped from the tower to the wall
at the taking of Jerusalem, the Pay
nims did not love the light that shone
in themânor, in faith, did I. his son,
when he was angry. Proper men, the
pair of you; but Wulf most warrior
like, and Sir Godwin most courtly."
"Now which do you think would
please a-woman most?"
"That, sir, depends upon the woman,"
answered Godwin. And straightway
his eyes began to dream.
"That, sir, we seek to learn before
the day is out. If you give us leave,"
added Wulf; "though, if you woula
know, I think my chance a poor one."
"Ah. well; it Is a very pretty riddle.
But I do not envy her who has its an
swering, for it might well trouble a
maid's mind, neither is ft certain when
all is done that she will guess best for
her own peace. Would It not be wiser,
then, that I should forbid them to ask
this riddle?" he added, as though to
â¢himself, and fell thinking while they
trembled seeing that he was minded
to refuse their suit.
At length he looked up again and
said: "Nay, let it go as God wills,
who holds the future in his hand.
Nephews, because you are good
knights and true, either of whom
would ward her wellâand she may
need wardingâbecause you are my
only brother's sons, whom I have
promised him to care for; and most
of all because I love you both with an
equal k>ve, have your wish and go try
your fortunes at the hands of my
daughter Rosamund In the fashion
you have agreed. Godwin, the elder,
first, as Is his right; then Wulf. Nay,
no thanks; but go swiftly, for I, whose
hours are short, wish to learn the an
swer to this riddle."
So they bowed and went, walking
side by side. At the door of the hall
Wulf stopped and said:
"She is in the church. Seek her
there, andâoh! I would that I could
wish you good fortune; but, Godwin,
I canndt. I fear me that this may be
the edge of that shadow of woman's
love whereof you spoke, falling cold
upon my heart."
"There is no shadow; there is light,
now and always, as we have sworn
that it should be." answered Godwin.
CHAPTER IV.
The Letter of Saladln.
It was past 3 in the afternoon and
snow clouds were fast covering up the
last gray gleam of the December day
as Godwin, wishing that his road was
longer, walked to the church across
the meadow. At the door of it he met
the two serving women coming out
with brooms in >'heir hands and bear
ing between them a great basket
filled with broken meats and foul
rushes. Of them he asked if the lady
Rosamund was still in the church, to
which they answered, curtseying:
" Yes, Sir Godwin*and she bade us
desire of you that you would come to
lead her to the hall when she had
finished making her prayers before
the altar."
"I wonder," mused Godwin,
"whether I shall ever lead her from the
altar to the hall, or whetherâl shall
bide alone by the altar."
Still he thought it a good omen that
she had bidden him thus, though
some might have read it otherwise.
<He entered the church, walked soft
ly on the rushes with which the nave
was strewn and by the light of the
lamp that burned there always saw
Rosamund kneeling before a little
shrine, her gracious head bowed upon
her hands, praying earnestly. Of
what, he wondered âof what?
Still, she did not hear him; so, com
ing* ifito the chancel he stood behind
her and waited patiently. At length,
wlttv a deep sigh, she rose from her
knees and turned, and he noted by the
light of the lamp that there were
tear-stains upon her face. Perhaps
She, too, had spoken with the Prior
John, who was her confessor also. Who
knows? At the least, when her eyes
fell upon Godwin standing like a
stave before her, she started, and there
broke from her Hps the words: .
"Oh, how swift an answer!" Then,
recovering herself, added, "To my mes
sage, I mean, cousin." â¢
"I met the women at the door," he
said.
"It is kind of you to come," Rosa
mund went on; "but. In truth, since
that day on Death Creek I fear to walk
a yard alone or In the company of
women only. With you I feel safe."
"Or with Wulf."
"Yes, or. with Wulf," she repeated;
"that is, when he is not thinking of
wars and adventures far away."
By now they had reached the porch
of the church, to find that the snow
was falling fast
"Let us bide here a minute," he said;
"it is but a passing cloud."
So they stayed there in the gloom,
and for a while there was silence. Theu
he spoke.
"Rosamund, my cousin and lady. 1
come to put a question to you, but
first âwhy you will understandâlt Is
my duty to ask that you will give me
no answer to that question until a full
day is passed."
"Surely, Godwin, that is to
promise. But what is this wonderful
question that may not be answered?"
"One short and simple. Will you
promise yourself to me in marriage?"
She leaned back against the wall of
the porch.
"My father " she began.
"Rosamund, I have his leave."
"How can I answer since you your
self forbid it?"
"Till this time to-morrow only.
Meanwhile, I pray you hear me. Rosa
mund. I am your cousin, and we
were brought up togetherâindeed, ex
cept when I was away at the Scottish
war, we have never been apart. There
fore, we know each other well, as well
as any may who are not wedded.
Therefore, too, you will know that I
have always loved you, first as a
brother loves his sister, and now as a
man loves a woman."
"Nay, Godwin. I knew It not; in
deed, I thought that, as it used to be,
ycur heart was other where."
"Other where? What lady?â"
"Nay, no lady; but In your dreams."
"Dreams? Dreams of what?"
"I cannot say. Perchance of things
that are not hereâthings higher than
the person of a poor maid."
"Cousin, in part you are right, for it
is not only the maid whom I love, but
her spirit also. Oh, In truth, you are
to me a dreamâa very symbol of all
that is noble, high and pure. In you
and through you, Rosamund. I
worship the heaven I hope to share
with you."
"A dream? A symbol? Heaven?
Are these glittering garments to hang
about a wonv.n's shape? Why, when
the truth came out you would find her
but a skull In a jeweled mask and
learn to loath her for a deceit that was
not her own, but yours. Godwin, such
trappings as your imagination pictures
could only fit an angel's face."
"They fit a face that will become an
angel's."
"An angel's? How know you? l
am half an Eastern; the blood runs
warm In me at times. I too have my
thoughts and visions. I think that I
love power and imagery and the de
lights of lifeâa different life to this.
Are you sure, Godwin, that this face
will be an angel's?"
"I wish I were as sure of other
things. At least, I'll risk it."
"Think of your soul, Godwin. It
might be tarnished. Tou would not
risk that for me, would you?"
He thought. Then answered:
"No; since your soul is a P ar f; of
mine, and I would not risk yours."
"I like you for that answer," she
said. "Yes; more than for all you
have said before, because I know that
it is true. Indeed, you are an honor
able knight, and I am proudâvery
proudâthat you should love me,
though perhaps it would be better
otherwise." Apd ever so little she
bent the knee to him.
"Whatever chances, in life or death
those words will make me happy, Rosa
mund."
Suddenly she caught his arm. "What
ever chances? Ah! what Is about to
chance? Great things, I think, for you
and Wulf and me. Remember, I am
half an Eastern, and we Easterns can
feel the future before It lays its hands
upon us and becomes the present. I
fear it, Godwinâl tell you that I fear
"Fear it not, Rosamund. Why should
you fear? On God's knees lies the scroll
of our lives, and of his purposes. The
words we see and the words we guess
may be terrible, but he who wrote it
knows the end of the scroll, and that It
is good. Fear not, therefore, but read
on with an untroubled heart, taking na
thought for the morrow."
She looked at him wonderingly, and
asked:
"Are these the words of a wooer or ol
a saint in warrior's weeds? I know
not, and do you know yourself? But
you say you love me and that you
would wed'me, and I believe it. Also
that the woman whom Godwin weds
will be fortunate, since such men are
rare. But I am forbid to answer until
to-morrow. Well, then I will answet
as I am given grace. So till then be
what you were of old, andâthe snow
has ceased. Guide me home, my cousin
Godwin."
So home they went through the dark
ness and the cold, moaning wind,
speaking no word, and entered the
wide hall, where a great fire built in
its center roared upward toward an
opening in the roof, whence the smoke
escaped, looking very pleasant and
cheerful after the winter night without.
And there, standing in front of the fire,
also pleasant and cheerful to behold,
although his brow seemed somewhat
puckered, was Wulf. At the sight of
him Godwin turned back through the
great door, and having as it were stood
for one moment in the light, vanished
again into the darkness, closing the
door behind him. But Rosamund
walked on toward the fire.
"You seem sad. cousin," said Wulf,
studying her. "Godwin has kept you
too iong to pray with him in church.
Well, it is his custom, from which 1
myself have suffered. Be seated on
this settee and warm yourself."
She obeyed without a word, and
opening her fur cloak, stretched out
her hands toward the flame, which
played about her dark and lovely
face. Wulf looked round him. Thf
hall was empty; then he looked at
Rosamund.
"I am glad to find this chance of
speaking with you alone, cousin, since
I have a question to ask of you; but
I must pray of you to give me no an
swer to it until foUr-and-twenty hours
be passed."
"Agreed," she said. "I have given
one such promise; let it serve foi
both; now for your question."
"Ah!" replied Wulf cheerfully, "I
am glad that Godwin went first,
since it saves me words, at which he
is better than I am."
"I do not know that, Wulf; at
least you have more of them," an
swered Rosamund, with a smile.
"More, perhaps, but of a different
qualityâthat is what you mean.
Well, happily, here mere words are
not in question."
"What, are in question,
Wulf?"
"Hearts. Your heart and my heart
âand I suppose Godwin's heart, if he
has oneâin that way."
"Why should not Godwin have a
heart.
"Why? Well, you see just now it
is my business to belittle Godwin.
Therefore. I declare âwhich you, who
know more about it. can believe or
not, as it pleases youâthat Godwin's
heart is like that of the old saint in
the reliquary of Stangateâa thing
that may have beaten once, and will
perhaps beat again in heaven, but now
is somewhat dead to this world."
Rosamund smiled, and thought to
herself that this dead heart had
shown signs of life not long ago. But
aloud she said:
"If you have no more to say to me
of Godwin's heart, I will begone to
read with my father, who waits for
me."
"Nay, I have much more to say of
my own." And suddenly Wulf be
came earnest âso earnest that hia
great frame shook, and when he
strove to speak he could but stammer.
At length it came forth in a flood ot
burning words.
"I love you. Rosamund! I love youâ
all of you, and about ycu, as I have
ever loved youâthough I did not know
it till the other dayâthat of the fight,
and ever shall love youâand I seek you
for my wife. I know that I am only a
rough soldier man. full of faults, not
holy and learned like Godwin. Yet I
swear that I would be a true knight to
you all my life, and. If the saints give
me grace and strength, do great deeds
in your honor and watch you well.
Oh! what more is there to say?"
"Nothing, Wulf," answered Rosa
mund, lifting her downcast eyes. "You
do not wish that I should answer you.
So I will thank youâyes, from my
heart, though, in truth, I am grieved
that we can be no more brother and
sister, as we have been this many a
â¢yearâand be going."
"Nay, Rosamund, not yet. Although
you may not speak, surely you might
give me some little sign, who am in
torment, and thus must stay this time
to-morrow. For instance, you might
let me kiss your handâthe pact said
nothing about kissing."
"I know naught of this pact, Wulf."
answered Rosamund sternly, although
a smile crept about the corners of her
mouth, "bu* I do know that I shall not
suffer you to touch my hand."
"Then I will kiss your robe." And
seizing a corner of her cloak, he pressed
it to his lips. _ r
"You are strongâl am weak. v* uir,
and cannot wrench my garment from
you, but I tell you that this play ad
vantages you nothing."
He let the cloak fall.
"Your pardon. I should have remem
bered that Godwin would never have
presumed so far."
â¢ Godwin," she said, tapping her foot
upon the ground, "if he gave a promise,
would keep it in the spirit as well as in
the letter."
"I suppose so. See what it is for an
erring man to have a saint for a
brother and a rival. -ay, be not angry
with me, Rosamund, who cannot tread
the path of saints."
"That I believe, but at least, Wulf,
there is no need to mock those who
can."
"I mock him not. I love him as well
asâyou do." And he watched her face.
It never changed, for in Rosamund's
heart was hid the secret strength and
silence of the East, that can throw a
mask impenetrable over eyes and fea
tures.
"I am glad that you love him. Wulf.
See to it that you never forget your
love and duty."
"I will; yesâeven If you reject me
for him."
"Those are honest words, such as I
looked to hear you speak," she replied
in a gentle voice. "And now, dear Wulf,
farewell, for I am wearyâ"
"To-morrow," he broke In.
"Aye," she answered In a heavy
voice. "To-morrow I must speak, and
âyou must listen."
' The sun had risen his course again,
and once more it was near 4 o'clock in
the afternoon. The brethren stood by
the great Are in the hall looking at each
other doubtfullyâas, indeed, they had
looked through all the long hours of
the night, during which neither of them
had closed an eye.
"It is time," said Wulf, and Godwin
nodded.
As he spoke a woman was seen de
scending from the solar, and they knew
her errand.
"Which?" said Wulf, and Godwin
shook his head.
"Sir Andrew bids me say that he,
would speak with you both," said the :
woman, and went her way.
"By the saints, I believe it's neither!"
exclaimed Wulf, with a little laugh.
"It may be thus," said Godwin, "and
perhaps that would be best for all."
"I don't think so," answered Wulf, as
he followed him up the steps of the
solar.
Now they had passed the passage
and closed the door, and before zhem
was Sir Andrew, seated in his chair by
the fire, but not alone, for at his side,
her hand resting upon his shoulder,
stood Rosamund. They noted that she
was clad in her richest robes, and a
bitter thought came into their minds
that this might be to show them how
beautiful was the woman whom both
of them must lose. As they advanced
they bowed first to her and then to
their uncle, while lifting her eyes from
the ground she smiled a little in greet
ing.
"Speak, Rosamund," said her
father. "These knights are in doubt
and pain."
"Now for the coup de grace," mut
tered Wulf.
"My cousins," began Rosamund in
a low, quiet voice, as though she were
saying a lesson, "as to the matter of
which you spoke to me yesterday, I
have taken counsel with my father and
with my own heart. You did me great
honor, both of you, in asking me to be
the wife of such worthy knights, with
whom I have been brought up and
loved since childhood as a sister lovt-s
her brothers. I will be brief as I may.
Alas! I can give to neither of you the
answer which you wish.-'
"Coup de grace, indeed," muttered
Wulf, "through hauberk, gambeson
and shirt, right home to the heart."
But Godwin only turned a trifle paler
and said nothing. Now there was si
lence for a little space, while from be
neath bushy eyebrows the old knight
watched their faces, on which the light
of the tapers fell. Then Godwin spoke.
"We thank you, cousin. Come.
Wulf. we have our answer; let us be
going."
"Not all of it," broke in Rosamund
hastily, and they seemed to breathe
again.
"Listen." she said; "for it it
pleases you. I am willing to make a
promise which my father has ap
proved. Come to me this time two
years, and if we all three live, should
both of you still wish me to wife. Unit
there may be no further space of pain
or waiting. I will name the man whom
I shall choose and marry him at
once."
"And if ere then one of us is dead?''
asked Godwin.
"Then," replied Rosamund, "If his
name be untarnished and he has done
no deed that is not knightly, I will
forthwith wed the other."
"Pardon meâ" broke in Wulf,
She neld up her hand and stopped
him, saying:
"You think this is a strange rede,
and so perhaps it Is; but the matter
is also strange, and for me the case
is hard. Remember, all my life is at
stake, and I may desire more time
wherein to make my choice, that be
tween two such men no maiden would
find easy. We are all of us still young
for marriage, for which, if God guards
our lives, there will be time and to
spare. Also in two years I may learn
which of you is the worthier knight,
who to-day both seem so worthy."
"Then !s neither of us more to you
than the other?" asked Wulf outright.
Rosamund turned red, and her bosom
heaved as she replied:
"I will not answer that question."
"And Wulf should not have asked
it," said Godwin. "Brother, I read Rosa
mund's saying thus: Between us she
finds not much to choose, or if she
does in her secret heart, out of her
kindnessâsince she is determined not
to marry for awhileâshe will not suf
fer us to see it and thereby bring
grief on one of us. So she says. 'Go
forth, you knights, and do" deeds
worthy of such a lady, and perchance
he who does the highest deeds shal!
receive the great reward.' For my
part, I fnd this Judgment wise and
Just, and I am content to abide its is
sue. Nay, I am even glad of it, since
it slves us time and opportunity ton
show our sweet cousm here, and all
our fellows, the mettle whereof we are
made, and strive to outshine each other
in the achievement of great feats
which, as always, we shall attempt side
by side."
"Well spoken," said Sir Andrew.
"And you. Wulf?"
Then Wulf. feeling that Rosamund
was watching his face beneath the
shadow of her long eyelashes, an
swered:
"Before heaven, I am content also.for whatever may be said against it,
now at least then- will be ttvo years
of war in which one or both of us -may
well fair, ar;d for that while at least no
woman-can cu'me between our brother

"And 1 a!so," said Godwin.
â¢ "In the spring; "in thy spring," re
plied Sir Andrew hastily: "when King
Henry moves his power. Meanwhile,

(iodwin laid down the letter, and all
four of them stared at one another in
amazement.
"Surely." said Wulf, "this is some
fool's trick played off upon our uncle
as an evil jest."
By way of answer Sir Andrew bade
him 'ift the silk that hid the contents
of thfÂ» coffer and see v. hat lay there.
Ke did so. and next moment threw
back his head like a man whom some
sudden light had blinded, as well he
might, for from it came such a flare
of gemÂ« as Essex had rarely seen be
fore. Red, green, and blue they spark
led; and. among them were the dull
glow of sold and the white sheen of
pearls.
"Oh, how beautiful! how beautiful!"
said Rosamund.
"Aye. 1 ' muttered Godwin: "fit fires
to maze a woman's mind till she
knows not right from wrong."
Wulf said nothing, but one by one
drew them from the chest â-oronet,

dals and robes, and other garments
of gold-embroldered purple silk. More
over, among these, also sealed with the
seals of Salah-ed-din, his viziers, of
ficers of state, and secretaries, was
that patent of which the letter spoke,
setting out the full titles of the Prin
cess of Baalbec, the extent and bound
aries of her great estates, and the
amount of her annual revenue, which
seemed more money than they had
ever heard of.
"I was wrong," said Wulf. "Even the
Sultan of the East could not afford
a jest so costly."
"Jest?*' broke In Sir Andrew; "it is
no jest, as I was sure from the first
line of the letter, that from end to end
breathes the very spirit of Saladin.
though he be a Saracen, the greatest
man on all the earth, as I, who was
a friend of his youth, know well. Aye,
and he Is right. In sense I sinned
against him as his sister sinned, our
love compelling us. Jest? Nay, no jest,
but because some vision of the night
that he believes the voice of God has
deeply stirred that great soul of his;
or perhaps some oracle of his magic
ians has led him on to this wild ad
venture. Girl, do you know what he
has made of you? Why, there are
Queens in Europe who would be glad to
own that rank and those estates in the
rich lands above Damascus. I know the
city and the castle of which he speaks.
It is aÂ«mightv place upon the banks
of Litani and Orontes, and after its
military governor for that rule he
would not give a Christianâyou will
be first in it, beneath the seal of Sa
ladinâthe surest title In all the earth.
Say, will you go and queen it there?"
Rosamund looked at the heaped-up,
gleaming gems and the parchment that
made her royal, and her eyes flashed
and her breast heaved, as they had
done by the Church of St. Peter on
the Essex coast. Thrice she looked
while they watched' her, then turned
her head as from the bait of some great
temptation and answered one word
onlyâ"Nay."
"Well spoken," said her father, who
knew her blood and its longings. "At
least, had the 'nay' been 'yea,' you
must have gone alone. Give me Ink and
parchment, Godwin."
They were brought, and he wrote:
"To the Sultan Saladin, from An
drew d'Arcy and his daughter, Rosa
mund.
"We have received your letter, and
we answer that where we are there we
â  will bide in that humble state which
God has given us. Nevertheless, we
thank you. since we believe yuu hon
est, and we wish you well, except in
your wars against the cross. As for
your threats, we will do our best to
bring them to nothing. Knowing the
customs of the East, we do not send
back your gifts to you. since to do so
would be to offer insult to one of the
greatest men in all the world, but if
you choose to ask for them, they are
yoursânot ours. Of your dream we
say that it was but an empty vision
of the night which a wise man should
forget. Your servant and your niece."
Then he signed, and Rosamund
signed after him, and the writing was
done up. wrapped in silk, and sealed.
"Now," said Sir Andrew, "hide away
this gear, since were it known that
we had such treasures in the place,
every thief in England would be our
visitor, some of them bearing high
names, I think."
So they laid the gold-embroidered
robts and the priceless sets of gems
back in their coffer, and having locked
it. hid It away in the great iron-bound
chest that stood In Sir Andrew's sleep
ing chamber. â¢
When everything was finished. Sir
Andrew said:
"Listen now, Rosamund, and you
also my nephews, for I have never told
you the true tale of how the sister
of Saladin. who was known as Zobeide,
the daughter of Ayoub, and after
ward christened into our faith by the
name of Mary, came to be mv wife,
and it is well that you should learn it,
if only to show how evil returns upon
a man. After the great Nur-ed-din
took Damascus, Ayoub was ffiade its
governor; then some three-aria-twenty
years ago came the capture of Harenc.
in which mv brother fell, and I was
wounded and taken prisoner. They bore
me to Damascus, where I was lodged
in the palace of Ayoub and kindly
treated. Here it was. while I lay sick;
that 1 made friends with the young
Saladin, and became accuainted with
his sister Zobeide, whom I met secret
ly in the gardens of the palace, and
although she numbered but half my
years, learned to love. The rest may
be guessed, for she loved me as I
loved her, and for my sake offered to
change her faith and fly with me to
England if opportunity ggould be
found, which was hard.
"Now, as chanced. I had a friend,
a dark and secretive man named Jebal,
the young sheik of a strange and ter
rible people, whose cruel rites no
Christian understands, but who are the
subjects of one Mahomet, in Persia,
and who live in castles at Masyaf, on
Lebanon. This man had been in al
liance with the Franks, and once ii\
a battle I saved his life from the Sara- )
cens at the risk of mv own, whereon,
being stirred to the heart, he swore
that did I summon him from the ends
of the earth he would come to me if
I needed help. Yes. and he gave me
his signet ring in token, and, by vir
tue of it, to he said, power in his
dominions eoual to his own, though
.v.. .... T ,>loUÂ«/j Goo It fa
upon my hand," and he showed them
i a heavy gold ring, in which was set
a black stone, with red veins running
I across the stone in the exact shape of
a dagger, and beneath the dagger
i words cut In strange characters that
none cou'd read.
"To be brief, in my plight. I be
thought me of Jebal, and found means
; to send him a sealed letter with his
i ring. Nor did he forget his promise,
for within twelve days the lady Zobeide
and I were galloping for Beyrout on
two horses so swift that ail the cavalry
1 of Ayoub could not overtake them. We
gained the city and there were wed
i ded, Rosamund, after your mother had
been baptized a Christian. Thence, too,
since it was not safe for us to dwell
in the East, we took ship and came
safe home, bearing this ring of Jebal
with us, for I would not give It up,
as his servants demanded that I should
1 do. save to him alone. But before the
vessel sailed, a man disguised as a
fisherman brought me a message from
Ayoub and his son Saladin, swearing
i that they would yet recapture Zobeide,
the daughter of one of them and sister
of the other.
"That is the story, and > ou see that
their oath has not been forgotten,
though when in after years they
i learned of my wife's death, they
i let the matter lie. But since
i then Saladin, who in those days
was but a noble youth, has become the
greatest Sultan-that the East has ever
known, and having been told of you,
Rosamund, by that traitor Lozelle, he
seeks to take you in your mother's
place, and, girl, I tell you that I fear
him."
"At least, we have a year in which
to prepare ourselves, or to hide," said
Rosamund; "or perhaps much longer,
seeing that this palmer must travel
back to the East before my uncle Sala
din can have our answer."
"Aye," said Sir Andrew; "perhaps we
have a year."
"What of the attack on the quay?"
asked Godwin, who had been thinking.
"The knight Lozelle was named there,
yet If Saladip had to do with it, it
seems strange that the olow should
have come before the word."
Sir Andrew brooded a while, then
said:
"Bring In this palmer. I would
question him."
So the man Nicholas, who was
found still eating as though his hun
ger would never be satisfied, was
brought in by Wulf. He bowed low
before the old knight and Rosamund,
studying them the while with his sharp
eyes, and the roof and the floor, and
every other detail of the chamberâ
for those eyes of his seemed to miss
nothing.
"You have brought me a letter from
far away, Sir Palmer, who are named
Nicholas," said Sir Andrew. /
"I have brought you a chest from
Damascus, Sir Knight, but of its con
tents I know nothing. At least you
will bear me witness that it has not
been tampered with," answered Nich
olas.
"I find it strange," went on the old
knight, "that one in your holy garb
should bo chosen as the emissary of
Saladin, with whom Christian men
have little to do."
"But Saiadin has much to do with
Christian men. Sir Knight. Thus he
takes them prisoner even in times of
pe*iceÂ«as h*L o*id me."
"Dsi he, then, take the Knight Lo
zeile prisoner?"
"The Knight Lozelle?" repeated the
rainier. "Was he a big, red-faced man,
with a scar upon his forehead, who al
ways wore a black cloak over his
mail?"
"That might be he."
"Then he was not taken prisoner,
but he came to visit Saladin at Damas
cus while I lay in boods there, for I
saw him twice or thrice, thourh what
his business was I do not know. After
ward he left, and at Jaffa I heard
that he had sailed for Europe three
months before I did."
Now the orethren looked at each
other. So Lozelle was in England.
But Sir Andrew made no comment,
only he svi6:
"Tell me your story, and be careful
that you speak the truth."
"Why should I sneak aught else who
have nothing to hide?" answered Nich
olas. "I was captured by some Arabs
as 1 journeyed to the Jordan' upon a
pilgrimage, who, when they found that
I had ski goods to be robbed of, would
have killed me. This, indeed, they were
about to do. had not some of Saladin's
soldiers come by and commanded
them to hold their hands and give
me over to the*m. They did so, andVthe
soldiers took me to Damascus. There
I was imprisoned, but not straightly,
and then it was that I saw Lozelle, or,
at least, a Christian man \>. ho had some
such name, and, as he seemed to be in
favor with the Saracens, begged him
to intercede for me. Afterward I was
brought before the court of Saladin,
and having questioned me. the SUltan
himself told me that I must either wor
ship the false prophet or die. to which
you can guess my answer. So they led
me away, as 1 thc-ught to death, but
none offered to do me hurt. Three days
I later Saladin sent for me again, and of
fered to spare my life if I would swear
an oath, which oath was that I should
take a certain package and deliver it
to you. or to your daughter named
â¢the Lady Rosamund, here at your hall
of Steeple, in Essex, and bring back
the answer to Damascus. Not wishing
to die, I said that I would do this, if
never breaks, that I should be set free
afterward."
"And now you are safe in England,
do you propose to return to Damascus
with the answer, and. If so, why?' 5
"For two reasons. Sir Andrew. First,
because I have sworn so to do, and I
do not break my word any more than
does Saladin. Secondly, because I
continue to wish to live, and the Sul
tan promised me that if I failed in my
mission, he would bring about my
death wherever I might be, which I
am sure he has the power to do by
magic or otherwise. Well, the rest of
the tale is short. The chest was hand
ed over to me as you see it, and with
it money sufficient for my facing to
and fro and something to spare. Then
I was escorted to Joppa, where I took
passage on a ship bound to Italy,
where I found another ship named The
Holy Mary sailing for Calais, which
wt- reached after being nearly cast
away. Thence I came to Dover in a
fishing boat, landing there eight days
ago. and having bought a mule, joined
some travelers to L&ndon, and so on
here."
"And how will you return?"
The palmer shrugged his shoulders.
"As best I may, and as quickly. Is
your answer ready, Sir Andrew?"
"Yes; if is here," and he handed him
tIM roll which Nicholas hid away in the
fi.iis of his great cloak. Then Sir An
diow added, "You say you know noth
ing of all the buslners in which you
play this part?"
"Nothing; or, rather, only thisâthe
officer who escorted me to Jaffa told
me that there was much stir among
the learned doctors and diviners at the
court because of a certain dream which
the Sultan had dreamed three times,
which had to do with a lady who was
half of the blood of Ayoub and half
English, and that my mission was
mixed up with this matter. Now I see
that the noble lady before me has eyes
strangely like those of the Sultan Sa
ladin." And he spread out his hands
and ceased.
"You seem to see a good deal, friend
Nicholas."
' Sir Andrew, a poor palmer who
wishes to preserve his throat unslit
must keep his eyes open. Now I have
.eaten well, and I am weary. Is there
any place where I may sleep, since I
v ould be gone at day ireak, for those
who do Saladin's business dare not
tarry, and I have your letter.."
With one more searching glance the
palmer bowed and went. When the
door closed behind him Sir Andrew
beckoned Godwin to him and whis
pered:
"To-morrow, Godwin, you must take
some men and follow this Nicholas to
see where he goes and what he does,
for of a truth I tell you I do not trust
himâaye, 1 fear him much! These em
bassies to and from the Paynim are
strange traffic for a Christian man.
Also thoufrh he says his life hangs on
it. 1 think that were he honest, once
safe in England there he would stop,
since the first Driest would absolve
him from an oath given under stress

What think you. Rosamund?"
"I?" she answered. "Oh, I think there
is more in all this than any of us
dream. I think,'.' she added in a voice
of distress and with an involuntary
wringing motion of the hands, "that for
this house and those who dwell in it
time is big with death and destiny,
and that sharp-eyed palmer is its mid
wife. How strange is the coii that
wraps us all about! And ioj now
comes the sword of Saladin to sever
it, and the hand of Saladin to drag me
from my peaceful state to a dignity
which I do not seek; and the dreams
of Saladin, of whose kin I am. to in
terweave my life with the bloody poli
tics of Syria and the dim, uri<>nding
war between cross and crescent, that
are both of them my heritage." Then,
with a woeful gesture, she turned and
left them.
Her father watched her go and said:
"The maid is right. Great business is
afoot in which all of you must bear
your parts. For no little thing would
Saladin stir thusâhe who braces him
self as I know well, for the great war
in which Christ and Mahomet, must go
down. Rosamund is right. On her
brow sh'nes the crescent diadem, and
at hr heart hangs the black cross,
and round her struggle creeds and na
tions. Well, well, although I shall not
live to see them, tbose things will
come about that are foredoomed, and.
you, Godwin, and your brother, must
weave your destined threads into this
web of life with that of the "woman
whoifff you â¢ love, as I and Ayoub's
daughter have woven ours. What,
Wulf. does the man sleep already?"
"Like a 'flog, for he seems outworn
with travel."
' Like a dog. with one eye open per
chance. I do not. wish-that he should
give v*Â» the slip during the night, as
I want more talk with him and other
things, of wh'ch I have spoken" to
Godwin.' % â¢
"No fear of that, uncle. I have
locked the stable dooT, and a sainted
palmer will scarcely leave us the pres
ent of such a mule." â¢
"Not he, if I know his tribe," an
swered Sir Andrew, "Now let us. eat
and a/terward take counsel together,
for we shall need it before all is done."
An hour before the dawn next morn-,
ing Godwin and Wulf were up, v nd
with them certain trusted men who
f would be needed. Presently. Wulf,
bearing a lantern in his hand, came
to where his brother stood by the Are
i in the hall.
"Where have you been?" Godwin
, asked. "To wake our guest, the palm
er?"
i "Of a truth,"/ grumbled Wulf, as he â 
came back with the lantern, "that
palmer sleeps as though Saladin had
already cut his throat." Then having
lit it, he returned to the guest place.
"Godwin," he called presently,
"come here. The man has gone!"
"Gone?" said Godwin as he strode to
the curtain. "Gone where?"
"Back to his friend Saladin, I think."
answered Wulf. "Look, that is how he
went." And he pointed to the narrow
window-slit in the wall of the sleep
ing place, whereof the shutter stood
wide, and to an oaken stool beneath,
by means of which the sainted Nicho
las had climbed up to and through it.
"Honest guests do not part from
their hosts thus," answered Wulf; "but
let us go and see."
So they ran to the stable and found
it locked and the mule safe enough
within, norâthough they searchedâ
could they find any trace of the palm
erânot even a footstep, since the
gorund was frostbound. Only on ex
amining the door of the stable they
discovered that an attempt had been
made to lift the lock with some sharp
instrument.
"It seems he was determined to be
gone, either with or without the beast,"
said Wulf. "Well, perhaps we can
catch him yet," and he called to the
men to saddle up and ride with him to
search the country.
For three hours they hunted far and
wide, but nothing did they see of Nich
olas.
"The knave has slipped away like a
night hawk, and left as little trace,"
reported Wulf. "Now, my uncle, what
may this mean?"
"I know not, save that it is of a
piece with the rest, and that I like it
little," answered the old knight anx
iously. "Here the value of the beast
was of no account, that is plain. What
he held of account was that he should
be gone in such a fashion that none
could follow him or know whither he
went. The net is about us. mv neph
ews, and I think that Saladin draws its
string."
Still less pleased would Sir Andrew
have been, could he have seen the
palmer Nicholas creeping round the
hall while all men slept, ere he gird
ed up his long gown and ran like a
hare for London. Yet he had done
this by the light of the bright stars,
taking note of every window in It,
more especially of those of the solar;
of the plan of the outbuildings also,
and of the path that ran to Steeple
Creek some five hundred yards away.

up the beach, pursued by each succes

The sand dunes spread their soft,
gray, rounded knolls through the sea
of fog, lonely, desolate, shifting, chang-.
lng ever their shape, to suit the humor
of the winds. '
As night drew on, the fog horns, bells
and whistles clanged, answered and
clanged again. From off the blotted
out waters of the bay, huge monsters
with glaring eyes emerged, signaled to
other monsters, bumped against the
rotting piles and with clanging of bells
and cianklng of chains submitted to be
made captive* and to He breathing and
puffing heavily, while shades fled in
and out unloading and reloading their
freight.
Voices called to other answering
voices, muffled in the thick gray pall.
Occasionally some jolly, invisible gnome
shouted New Year's greeting to a pass
ing friend and laughed with hearty ex
ultation as the friend took mere sub
stantial shape and proved to be the
veriest stranger.
Along the broken, wooden sidewalks
a thinly clad little figure stole, a tiny
violin beneath one arm, each grimy,
claw-like hand thrust into the wrist of
the opposite sleeve, seeking warmth.
The purple knees peeped out from holes
in baggy trousers, which had evidently
seen long and good service upon the
nether limbs of some man of Goliah
like proportions. Turned up in many
folds at the bottom, they flapped about
his feet. His shoes broken and evident
ly rescued originally from some ash
heap, let the water filter through at
every movement; each step fell with a
soaked, squelching sound.
He had quit playing at the street cor
ners some time before; people were too
hurried, too busy making holiday to
listen; the thin "*tle tunes had floated
unheeded on the chill air; the little fig
ure stood unnoticed beside the lamp
post in the raw mist.
He shivered and a racking cough tore
at his vitals as he leaned for support
against a wall. By degrees he made
his weary way, a sad little waif, adrift
on a sea, the shores of which had long
since faded from view.
Amid the slums of Barbary Coast he
halted before a dwelling where the un
curtained windows stared like dull,
bleared, unseeing eyes, and sooty
streaks ran down its front as if these
same eyes had wept untold grimy tears.
From the sidewalk a broken stairway
led to a basement lair, where, in the
dim light of a candle, an-amphibious
.monster could be heard rumbling.
Timidly the claw-like hand stole out
and grasped the rusty railing, the little
feet trod softly down; there in the dim
light .a bristling, hairy man sat. nod
ding,, cursing when awakened by an
unbalancing lurch. At one-- more - des
perate recovery his bleared eyes fell
upon the child, slipping noiselessly in.
With an oath and a wavering plunge
he' had the boy. Unheeding cries for
mercy cr excuses the ready blows fell,
although delivered unsteadily and at
random upon his .wretched body.
"Oh, Ligo! There is thisâthere is ho
'moreâbut the 20 cents I have
broughtâ"
"Pig! Brat of the gutter!"
"Yetâbut 5 cents moreâbelieveâ "
_"Peace! Son of a pig!"
"Ligo! 1 did but buy a loafâyou
gave me no bread! It was the hunger!
Oh, good Ligo, have mercy!"
"Dog! Beast! You stay the long day
through and bring but 20 cents! You
steal my money and stuff your glutton
belly! Could you not steal the bread?
Why should you pay my money?
Have- I not told you oft to steal or
starve? Brat!"
Again the blows fell relentlessly.
â¢ "Mercy! It is the cough! I cannot
make the music when I cough! Ligo!
Oh, good Ligo! Believeâ!"
"Get from my sight, scum of the
streets!"
With a final blow and an added un
steady kick at the writhing form, which
fell short owing to the condition of the
deliverer, the man released the child.
Taking up the silver he secured a bot
tle and staggered up the stairway,
lurching away in the gloom toward
some rendezvous of crime.
The little bruised body crept to an
old mattress, lay down and between
sobs* and cough-racking paroxysms,
with cheek pressed to his beloved vio
lin, slept the sleep of utter exhaustion.
When the night was far spent then
came Ligo staggering and stumbling
home with filled bottle, uttering inco
herent and Indiscriminate curses upon
â¢ the uneven sidewalk and the body of
his unconscious slave, sleeping below.
But the derisive imps of the vine
took sudden toll, his clumsy feet tang
ling in a broken board, he fell head
long down the stairway, his bloated
face striking full upon the shattered
bottle; there the drunken coward lay
and slowly bled to death, unconscious
of his own predicament.
Early on New Year's day the boy
awoke from cough-racked slumber;
taking f p his little violin he stole fear
fully past that awful horror lying so
quietly in the clotted, crimson pool.
With the remnants of that dearly
bought loaf in his pockets he fled from
the place he had called home ever
since, as a tiny child he had been sold,
as veritable a slave as ever dwelt be
low the Mason and Dixon line.
The early morning air was raw, the
fog still held, and spread its cold gray
pall over the awakening city. There
were few abroad; a holiday gave ex
cuse for a renewed snuggling under
warm blankets, a lingering at late
breakfasts, a few extra naps to make
up for hours of revelry on the preced
ing night, a petting and comforting of
aching heads and disordered stomachs,
consequent upon those same hours of
revelry.
The lonely waif made his way to a
favorite corner, his claw-like fingers
clutched, while the little bow drew out
the lilting air of a popular melody; he
shivered, his pinched face grew gray
with suffering, as the elfin, old-young
eyes turned from face to face with cal
culating intensity.
One toil-grimed hand thrust a nickel
into his palm, as its owner growled,
"Here, sonny, run home to your mam
my!"
"Thank, kind sir, of immediately I
go!"
But the shivering form still stood, the
ragtime tune still jigged.
A tiny, stray dog, starving about the
streets, sniffed at his broken shoes, but
when he stooped gently to stroke It,
crouched as if expecting blows.
"Nay, little one!"- he murmured, "fear
not, I will not beat; you and meâto

gether weâbrats of the gutter!*
Seating himself upon the curb he
fed the crumbs from his pockets to the
dog, then rising wearily, walked on
down Kearny street, followed by the
tottering animal; perceiving this, he
took the little thing in his arms and
made for a shelter he sometimes used
when bad luck and fear of Ligo's wrath
made diplomatic observances neces
sary.
First, he knew there must be food,
both for himself and his helpless pen
sioner. He realized to the full there
was no possibility of return to where It
lay. I
He turned into a butcher shop and
tendering his nickel with a lordly air,
said: "Five cents of the meat, please."
For an Instant the butcher regarded
his customer intently, also the burden
that he bore so carefully, then placing
a slice of beef and a generous cut of.
bologna in a paper handed it, remark
ing: 'â 
"Here Mounseer Macaroni, never
mind the pay; when you get to be a
millionaire you shall pay me back with
interest."
"Thank, you shall be repay," serious
ly replied the boy.
He entered a bakery next and-from
the hurried saleswoman purchased
bread, then turned intent upon his
refuge.
Outside upon the curbing squatted
some half-dozen newsboys, bundles of
papers neglected for the moment, as
the owners vigorously squabbled in the
intricacies of some mysterious game.
An instant's pause of the waif drew
attention.
"Hi, Dago! Drop that pup!" shouted
one. 1 iiSjl
"Here! Gimme that fiddle! Where'd
ye steal it?"
The band rose as ose boy in pursuit
of legitimate game. Followed by shouts,
catcalls, shrieks ot derision and doubt
ful missiles the child fled down an al
ley; with grunts of mutual approba
tion the young savages returned to
their game; they felt they could safely
leave the routing of the Philistine to
some future occasion.
In an angle of this alley stood a tum
bledown, deserted blacksmith shop,
awaiting the magic touch of Midas for
transformation into a ten-story brick.
Creeping past a broken board, the boy
deposited his burdens upon a bed of
coal sacks and discarded horse blan
k Here was the one spot in all the world
for him. where the wicked ceased from
troubling and the weary could find rest.
Near by lay several battered tomato
cans and a broken dish or two, rescued
from heaven alone knew what ash bin,
and representing the sole housekeeping
stock. One tin contained water; from
this the starved dog lapped eagerly; the
boy offered the raw meat, which the
animal licked but could not eat; turn
ing away it nestled down. The child
rubbed the fog-wet hair as dry as pos
sible, covered the shivering thing In the
blanket, then, ate his own portion of
bread and sausage. As he finished his
meal, "ping" went the violin,, and a
snapped string flew.
"Why this?" apostrophized the boy,
"know you not if I have "not the mu
sic there is no bread for the little one,
or me?".
Then after long, sorrowful gazing at
the tiny dog, he" Whispered:.
"Sleep, little one-'-the meat, it is too
much; it must be milk'; this I will get;
fear not, I will. return."
Repairing the violin as well as possi
ble, although it was now raining stead
ily, he went out into the downpour,
walked a few blocks, and stood play
ing; one from the dozens passing
pressed a dime upon him, as with the
ghost of a smile he said:
"Thank, it is enough."
Hurrying home he secured a tomato
can and intercepted a milkman.
"Five cents of the milk, please."
"Hello, Dago! Sick?" Want it ftr
yourself?" â¢
"No, me not sick*-fcr my dog It Is!"
he replied, drawing himself r p with the
conscious pride of possession, he, who
never in all this hard world had owned
a thing before.
Thci battered tin filled without
charge, he tottered away, the man
gazed wonderingly after him, then
whipped up his horses and drove away,
his conscience at peace.
Why should he trouble? It was none
of his business. There was some one
surely to look after the child; no use
getting mixed up In other people's af
fairs. . â¢
The boy offered the milk, rejoicing to
see . the animal lap;, a little sufficed,
then the two bits of flotsam curled .
down together and slept, the rain beat
ing a lullaby on the broken shingles
above their heads. All that day the
wild rain poured in- torrents, such a
deluge as only San Francisco can pro
duce.
Late in the afternoon the child awoke
and tried to induce his companion to
eat; feebly the tiny tail wagged, while
the soft brown eyes gazed adoringly
into eyes as brown, that pleaded; then
with a lick of his benefactor's grimy
hand, the little bunch of draggled hair
and bones, looking so like a remnant of
door mat, stretched wearily out, shiv
ered once or twice âand died.
The child continued to stroke ths lit
tle head for some time, hoping for
some sign of recognition, but the affec
tionate brown eyes were dull and
glazed.
He gazed sorrowfully at the can of
milk, the scattered remnants of food.
then realizing his pet would never need
them more, the heart that h.vd made
such a brave fight ' suddenly broke;
throwing himself down with an inar
ticulate, gasping cry, he moaned him
self into insensibility: ,
Rousing later, he felt for his violin.
The rain had swollen and warped it, the
strings lay broken, never again could
it pulsate to the jigging ragtime or the
soft melodies of his own forgotten land.
He laid it tenderly aside, as some
thing irrevocably sacrificed upon an
altar of necessity, where all else in his
short life had come to lie; then he
carefully wrapped the blanket mechan
ically about the little stiffened dog, cud
dled down beside it, drew it snugly
into his arms, and between paroxysms
of coughing, stroked its head.
When the dawn of the new day
broke over the city by the Golden
Gate the fog had sped, the bay sparkled,
in the sunshine, the glad New Year
was fairly ushered in; the workaday
world once more took up its burdens.
The sunshine struggled through the
grimy windows of the shop, where the
bruised and tortured forms lay at peace
behind the crumbling forge. *

harshly inquired.
"I'm looking for work, sir," I replied,
gazing fascinated at his fried onions.
He must have taken my glance for
ope of profound admiration. His man
ner softened, and, after sizing me up,
he said 1 didn't look much like a work
ing man. That wasn't my fault, I said,
and then told him all my troubles.
â¢Poor boy!" he said, in such a sad
way I could have wept over my own
misfortunes. "Really, you are not
able to work after those hardships.
Your system is all run down. What
you need is some light occupationâ
a mild diversion, as it were, to take
your mind off yourself and tone you
up. We have the very place for you."
"Where is it?" I asked, ready to
' shed tears of joy and gratitude.
"At our railroad camp in Polk
County, seventy-five miles from here.
Splendid scenery, nice surroundings,
pure air and fine board. We will pass
you out on the railroad and pay you
$1 50 per day and deduct 50 cents for
board. The train starts in an hour.
Are you ready to go?"
Was I ready? Well, guess yes.
When he wrote out the pass I gal
loped all the way to the station. I
traveled in my baggage and made
good time. A little jerk-water narrow
gauge engine and one coach com
prised ."the train and I took a front
seat in the car. The trip to Living
ston oonsumed most of the day, ow
ing to numerous stops at new settle

When the conductor punched my tick
et he wanted to know why I went to
Livingston.
"To wof-k Â©n the railroad," I said
proudly. â .
"You'll stay just long enough to get
back.", he retorted with a brutal
laugh.
I.didn't understand him then, but
later on his meaning struck me in a
lump and the blow was a cocker.

it was all carried over the bar by J. W.

Of course there were times when
J. W. had moments of repentance, but

he could be good, at least till his head

THE SAN FRANCISCO v SUNDAY CALL.
By Cliarles Dryden
tling city of Livingston comprised
much swamp, three box cars standing
on a siding and some tiny log huts in
the bushes. In the few places clear of
water a fellow could get all the mud
he wanted and then some. I was the
only passenger who played the train
to the limit, and when I alighted a
large man in a red flannel shirt
seemed by instinct to know just what
to do with me.
"See that cabin?" he said, pointing
to a' hut at the edge of the clearing.
"That's where you sleep. Now go to
the cars and get your supper. I'll heed
you in' the morning."
Two of the boxcars formed the dining
hall, fitted up with rough board tables
and benches spiked to the floor. In the
third car, which was coupled to the
others, a dope-dazed Chinaman dream
ed' he was the cook. Supper being over,
the Chinaman brought me a tin platter
of cold salt pork and corn bread. I ate
the whole business and would have
asked for more only I didn't know the
cook very well. After cleaning out
the banquet hall, I groptd among
stumps and puddles to the cluster of
icg huts. Campfires burned In front of
the doors, lighting up groups of mud
dy, shaggy men, who looked like pi
rates, smoking and swearing in the
weird glare.
In the doorway of the hut assigned
to me, and which stood apart from the
others, sat a man of giant skeleton
frame, with his face burled In his bony
hands. He appeared to be thinking.
His huge feet were sprawled out
toward a pile of blazing sticks. On
hearing me approach he peered up
through his fingers, still keeping his
features concealed.
"Who sent you here, bub?" he
growled.
"The big man in .the red shirt," I
said, apologetically.
"That's the boss. Did he say anything
about the Prize Beauty?' 1
"Ho did not," I replied, beginning to
feel shared. "Who might he be?"
"Me!" said the skeleton, with a hor
rible laugh. "I'm a free show in these
parts. Look!"
Removing his hands, he exposed his
face to the firelight. Under each ey<*
was a wide, crescent-shaped scar, fully
two inches long, with the points turn
ed upward. Another scar, clean cut
and regular, passed along below his
chin and extended from ear to ear.
'in the middle this gash was at least
thfee inches wide, and, like the oth
ers, was of a dull red in a setting .of
sickly white. My hutmate certainly
was a Prize Beauty.
"That is what they call me here,"
he said, as if reading my thoughts,
"and I'll tell you about it. The other
fellows know, and I'll give it to you
straight, only don't laugh. Sit there
on that stump and listen. Now, then,
first off, have you ever been In love?"
Feeling it safer to tell the truth, I
said that Mr. Cupid's dart had not yet
pierced my tender vitals.
"Don't ever be in love, my boy," he
went on mournfully. "There's nothing
in that game. I was in love once, and
all I got out of it was a face like com
ets shooting across the milky way. The
lady lived in Indiana, and at the time
we met I weighed 360 pounds. Looked
like a prize Berkshire hog at the coun
try fair. She said she couldn't marry a
fat man, so I went in for anti-fat. I
owned a drug store and kept the stuff
in stock. Well, the medicine pulled me
down as thin as I am now and left me
a holy show. Two pouches of loose skin
hung beneath my eyes, like buckskin
purses, and the flap of waste hide un
and committing more right on top of
their remorse, but it's a good thing
just the same.
In the course' of time our friend
J. W. took upon himself a wife and
began to give an imitation of a man
living a sober and respectable life.
That is to say, he went to church, at
least when his wife had a new bonnet
or his cigars had given out, and he
did hia dissipating quietly and in or
der behind the closed doors of his
highly respectable club, along with
other decent members of society. It
was not that he behaved himself more
but that he didn't let so many people
find out about it. Of course Mrs. J.
W. was dead on to J. W.s shortcom
ingsâalthough she would probably
have called them longcomings. The
man who thinks that women don't
have a pretty clear idea of what their
husbands are doing isn't very well
acquainted with the sex. She knew
distoibance of de peace."
"Couldn't dey!" I says, getting hot
In de collar. "Well," says I, "do you
call dese tings polite remarks, or are
dey long green? Is dese tings proof
dat your husband can outslng any
Cherman spieler dat ever come over
on a ten-dollar steerage ticket, or
net? Maybe I was only distoibing de
peace, but If I was, somebody else
paid de fine."
Dats what I said, being stuck on
meself. I'll never be anything but a
farmer If I live to be as old as one of
Mr. Depoo's youngest stories. Duchess,
she kind of felt for de long green I
was making such a front wit, she kind
of annexed It, and she kind of sunk it
in her Jeans âand dat was de finish
of it for yours truly.
"I'll keep dis, Master Cheems," she
says. "You are so foolish a young
man dat you are not to be trusted wit
money. I suspected dat you was making
tips down dere when I hears your voice
going up, up, to de Harlem, so I Just
jollied you to make you show de stuff;
gave you a con talk to make you flash
de goods so I could get my pretty
hands on 'em. So foolish a person, one
to say flim-flammed out of his tips,
must not be let to keep money; so your
dear wife will hold de stakes for you
till you get wiseâas wise as your wife."
If man wasn't so easy made a fool of
by a woman he would have an easier
Job proving how much wiser dan
woman he Is. If I had kept all de tips
Duchebs has touched me for, if I had
salted away half of de boodle I has lost
to dat woman because I gets chesty
when she is only getting wise, I'd have
a bank roll so big dat it would be a
shame to own it. I suppose dats de rea
son dat a man is made to tink dat he is
wiser dan woman, is to make it easier
for -voman to woik him. Woman isn't
built to woik very hard, and as she has
mostly to woik man, de good Lord
made him so easy to woik dat it seems
tier my chin would half-sole a pair of
boots. The lady never would have me
in that shape, so I went to Indianapolis
and hired a beauty doctor to skin me."
"Did he do you up like that?" I in
quired in shocked accents.
"Not quite. The job was all right at
first. The scars on my eyes scarcely
showed, and my neck bore a thin red
mark. Looked like I had worn a hat
with a rubber band under the chin, kid
fashion. The lady warmed up right
away, and the love business was boom
ing until I started to get fat. That put
an end to love's young dream and
drove me forever from the haunts of
females."
Here the Prize Beauty bent his head
in silent anguish, while I sat and shiv
ered and waited for the end.
"The flesh kept piling up on me in
spite of anti-fat, or anything else. That
.drug had lost its grip, and I soon went
up to 300 pounds. The loose skin the
beauty doctor cut away left my face
cramped for room. I couldn't shut my
eyes, and the wide hem taken up under
the chin drew my head forward, till I
could see nothing but the ground with
eyes that never closed. On top of this
awful affliction the lady I loved sent
word that she heard I had lost a nickel
in boyhood and was out looking for It.
At last she expected me, because I
walked with my head down and eyes
wide open.
"Her-cruel sneer stung me, mostly in
the places where I had no skin. I sent
a farewell note to the fickle maiden,
sold the drug store and flew the coop.
Worry and despair pulled the fat off
me again, but the strain on the cuts
was so great they stretched and never
closed up. I'll never be any better," he
added sadly. 'This is a good place for
me and here I stay. Time now to go
to bed. Climb In."
Vastly moved by this story of beauty
and spurned affections, I wriggled into
a bunk that contained the same "kind
of bedding they give a horse. Lodgers
in railroad camps furnish their own
bedding, and I had forgotten mine. The
night turned cold, and I would have
suffered much but for the heat gener
ated in my system thinking of the oily
haired villain at Houston who had
Steered me into that den of luxury and
mild diversion. At daylight all hands
were routed out to a breakfast of fat
pork, dried apples and coffee. The
Chinaman was at his worst in the cof
fee line. After breakfast I was handed
a shovel and loaded with the gang on
to a string of flat cars pushed by a
dinky engine. In a narrow cut of yel
low clay, which the rain had washed
upon the track, the workers were
dumped off into the ditches on either
side of the road and ordered to shovel
mud. The water covering the mud had
frozen a thin sheet of Ice over night,
and when I jumped I bogged down to
my knees in the chill mass. I looked at
the other fellows. Light occupation
seemed to be their regular business, so
I bored in and dug with the best of
them.
The tops of the flat cars on which
we piled the yellow muck stood level
with our faces. In order to discharge
a shovel load it was necessary to bang
the shovel edge on the car. The ef
fect was like dropping a decayed
pumpkin off a tall building. Gobs of
smeary yellow goo squirted in all di
rections. It lodged in my eyes, ears
and hair and plastered my clothes
from top to bottom. After loading
the cars the engine towed them to
another place, where we pushed the
mud overboard and went back for
all the time that J. W. was punishing
the year's output of the distilleries
pretty severely every night he went
down to the club, but, being a wise
woman, she held her peace, thanking
her favorite constellations meanwhile
that he kept out of the police station
and always remembered to tell the
right street and number to the cab
man when the club was closed.
The years wore slowly away and for
a while It appeared as though the house
of Mrs. J. W. was built on exceedingly
unstable sand. But the end came at
last. J. W. arose one morning of a
â  certain cold December day with a head
like an overloaded barrel and a general
feeling that the universe was a misfit
and that all the inhabitants thereof
were united in an endeavor to make his
life miserable. Also he discovered that
his hands didn't seem to have any very
definite relation to the rest of his body.
Each separate and distinct hair on his
queer she isn'jt ashamed to tom such
an easy trick.
But I was going to tell you about me
fren de Jap valet. Dat mug spends
most of his time reading a book by
Billyâno, not Billy, but anodder Emer
son named Ralph Waldo. I don't think
he was In de minstrel line like Billy;
anyway when de Jap give me one of
his books to read I didn't see no good
end-man jokes in it. It was funny, all
right; but Tokio tells me dat It wasn't
meant to be funny.
"What is it, den?" I asks him.
"It's philos'phy," he says,
"What kind of a flim-flam game is
dat?" I says.
"It's a speculation on de nature of
tings," he says right off de reel, like
he knew what de woids meant.
"You didn't have to read no book
to do dat?" I says. "Tings," I says,
"is tings, and dey stays tings wedder

right out, and puts 'em in safe deposit.

de bait off the hook, and den it will

"You mistake," says Tokio. "De

or on, la not material tings; not reai
tings, not tings wit substance."
"Oh." I says, "I tumble, now.
more. When the noon hour came I
resembled the statue of some great
general In the modeling stage. All I
needed was a sword in place of the
shovel. The only spot clear of mud
was my mouth, and I filled that with
fried pork.
Work in the afternoon was much
the same, except the late March air
was not so keen. The supply of mud
held out. in fact, it oozed into the
cut as fast as we hauled it away, and
1 beheld enough gentle diversion amid
pleasant surroundings to be the death
of me. The Prize Beauty was not at
work that day. I found him in the
cabin door after supper peeling off
his scalped face and looking at the
fire. He asked me how I liked the
place. I said I'd go back to Houston
in the morning.
"Not this time, bub," he said, kind
ly. "It's seventy-five miles to Hous

head seemed to be making an earnest
effort to stick as far as possible into
his skull and his face felt as though it
belonged to some one vise and was
about three inches too small to fit him.
His first idea was that he had better
die at once and have it done with.
Than, on more mature consideration,
he concluded that he would give him
self another chance. Mrs. J. W. being
informed of the state of affairs ordered
dry toast and weak tea to be put on
the ways and sent out for the family
appendix-amputator. The latter looked
J. W. over and punched him in two
or three places where he thought it
would hurt most. Then he put on his
glasses, screwed up his face and in
formed him that if he would confine
his gastronomic operations to infant
food and beef tea there was a chance
that he might live another year. Ex
tract of corn was not included in the
list of prescribed nutriments.
Ghosts, eh? Well, I has known mugs
dat speculated on ghosts, and dey is de
easiest frens I has to locateâdey is
all in de bughouse now. In de 'sylums,
See? Cut it out, Tokio. You is a
good boy, and can drink a glass of
beer like a real American. Cut out de
ghosts, or you'll be seeing tings dat
isn't dere. Have nottlng to do wit
philos'phy, if dats its game. Opium
is easier, and you have de smoking of
it. I'll loan you me copy of Billy
Emerson's Song Book. It'll do you
more good, and when you have loined
de woids I'll teach you de tunes, and
we'll give a concert to de help."
Tokio looked like he would go an
odder round wit me and see could he
get his ideas into me capo, but I dis
couraged him. "It's no use, Tokio,
mo boy," I says to him. "I know what
you are up against now, only I didn't
know its polite name was philos'phy.
In America we calls one kind pipe
dt earns and anodder kind crankism.
Dey is all de same ting. Also, Tokio,
dey leads to de same kind of wuzzi
ness. Cut it all out. It comes from a
bad liver. You are not taking enough
exercise, me boy. Put on two over
coats and come wit me for a ten-mile
fast walk down de Post Road. No
body on cart ever speculated on de
nature of tings while he was in a
good sweat from open air exercise.
Dere isn't a man in a bughouse in de
woild dat ever rode horseback or
played golf or sawed wood regular.
Tings dat Isn't real wasn't made to be
speculated on. Walk around a block
to get rid of seeing a ting dat can't be
seen. Dey may be all right for mugs,
dat can see double, but for plain,
sober taxpayers de woist dat can hap
pen is to snarl up his tinking machine
about tings dat isn't.'
"But," says Tokio, butting in, "if we
do not study philos'nhv. how can we
know what is?"
Beauty did mental arithmetic in and
around in affairs made me ill. But he
was right. They had me canned in the
swamp, and the only way out was to
dig it with a shovel. I went to bed in
my muddy clothes a blighted, blasted,
ruined mechanic. Anyhow, I could
eat while working out my sentence, and
that was a better prospect than walk
ing back to Houston.
Comforted by this view of the case,
I fell asleep, and remained that way all
night, in the morning 1 was unable to
move, and thought I had become para
lyzed from overwork, anxiety and wor
ry. But ft was merely the clothes. The
heat of my body caked the mud .with
which the garments were smeared, and
I was in a plaster cast. This pleasing
discovery cheered me much, and as the
day was Sunday, and bright and warm,
I spent most of the time beating the
mud armor off myself with a club. The
Prize Beauty showed me how, as he
was on to all the niceties of camp life.
He had spent years at the business,
and said he would end his un'.iappy
days in gummy seclusion. This victim
df unrequited love worked one week
and loafed two on the proceeds. That
was his system.
A rugged constitution and an appe
tite of the same enabled me to survive
my career in Mr. P. Beaumont's
swamp. At the end of two weeks I
headed for Houston to invest my 60
cents net nr..fit..
After hearing this verdict J. W. re
verted for a moment, to his original in
tention of dying quietly and graceful
ly. Death and the prospect the doctor
held out seemed very much alike to
him anyway. Then he concluded that
he would see what a sober life would
seem like, for the. sake of the scientific
aspects of the experiment if for no
other reason. In other words, he swore
off. That's all there is to the story.
J. W. is still true to his name.
All of which leads us to the im
portant conclusion that a New Year's
resolution 13 not so much a matter of
moral reformation as it is of physical
deterioration. Most men determine to
be good only when they can't afford to
be bad any longer. We would also
conclude that the paths of virtue are
crowded with people whose feet have
grown tender from treading other
roads.

grounds, but visitors on foot can walk

Th? path, leaving the driveway., led
between sturdy oaks through whose
branches the flickering sunlight fell
in . golden shadows, oaas that had
stood for generations, the pride of the
ccunty. Mrs. Lincoln and her daugh
ter walked slowly forward, exclaim
ing in delight at the grand old trees,
until a sudden fork in'the path caused
them to-halt-in-spme perplexity.
"Although, as- the caterpillar said, if
you don't care. where you are going,
it cannot matter much wiich way
you go," laughed Ethel Lincoln. "And
both look attractive," she added. As
they hesitated, a' young man, clad, in
knickerbockers and carrying a gun,
came 'down one of the paths. Mrs.
Lincoln Jooktfd relieved..
"Here- is "a gamekeeper, or poacher,
or something,"' she said. "He can
probably tell us. which is the best
way to go."'
The man. who ".had stopped on see
ing the "two ladies, no w came toward

"Can .1 be of any service?" he in
quired. His voice -wa3 prepossessing,

"We are anxious to see the house
and the lake," she said: "Could you
direct us bow to reach them?"
"The right-hand . path will take you
directly to the house," he answered
civilly. "And the lake âthe lake is a

ment, then went onâ"I belong here,
and "if you would care to have me

"Mrs. Lincoln smiled kindly.
"If you would be So good."

declared. "I never imagined anything
so romantic. It'sâit's perfect," aban
doning a vain search, for suitable ad
jectives. The gamekeeper looked
pleased.
As he turned and beckoned the
coachman, Ethel Lincoln sighed.
' "How beautiful it all is," she ex
claimed. "Really, I could marry El
lerslie just to live here." The game
keeper, his face unmoved, stepped
forward. ,
' May I help you in, madam?" he
asked decorously.
Mrs. Lincoln, slipping her fingers
into the tiny gold purse swinging at
her wrist, pulled forth a coin and,
without looking at it, held it toward'
the man. To her surprise, he flushed
and drew back. But at sight of the
look of unconscious dismay on the
girl's face, his half-uttered protest
died and he quietly accepted the
money.
As they drove homeward Mrs. Lin
coln laughed.
"No wonder that man stared," she
said. "These English coins are so

shilling I gave him a sovereign. But
how abnormal for any foreigner to
hesitate at a tip. Shall we send El

would hardly remember us and It is
many years" since his mother died.
Do you think it would be worth
while?"
"I suppose not," agreed Ethel, not,
however, without a secret twinge of
disappointment.
But the next day, on returning from
their drive, the innkeeper met them.
In his hand was a letter and a card.
"His Lordship was here this after
noon," he said, "and asked If you were
the lady who had lost this locket,"
producing a small gold ornament. "If
you were, I was to give you this let

IN the last analysis, men succeed or
fail in proportion to their ability to
put things through. He who has
learned to grip a purpose and cling
to it until it is accomplished has mas
tered one of the secrets of happy and
effective living. But to do it requires a
bulldog tenacity, like that illustrated
by General Grant when he declared
that he would fight out his campaign if
it took all summer, and by Melville
Cox, one of the first and noblest of
American missionaries to Africa, who
exclaimed at the climax of his career,
"Let a hundr.d men fall before Africa

Every now and then we see a great
structure in process of erection on
whioh work has ceased. As the months
go by and no signs of activity appear
the projectors are either pitied or
laughed at. But it would be a far more
pathetic spectacle if we could bring out
into the open the unfinished posses

household articles, the inventions, the
poems, essays and paintings that
would be brought to light, half done,
quarter done, three-quarters done, all
but done, and yet still uncompleted.
Of course, even in their unfinished

"ELLERSLIE."
When, on Thursday afternoon, Mrs.
Lincoln and Ethel drove under the
porte cochere of Ellerslie Abbey, al
ready the lawns and terraces were
dotted with bright frocks and para
sols, while from a gay marquee came
the strains of a military band. Ethel's
spirits rose.
"I feel that I am going to have a
good time," she declared. "My new
gown is becoming, my 1 t perfect, so
chÂ»er up, Mumsie."
"Mrs. and Miss Lincoln," shouted the
flunkey, and into the great hall, panel
ed t<- the root with oak and hung with
the family portraits of three centuries,
they passed. A gentleman turned from
the nearest group of people and came
forward. Tall, slim, frock coated, with
white gardenia in his buttonhole,
there was yet no mistaking him. For
a moment Mrs. Lincoln stared, then a
slow smile curved her lips.
"Sr, it was youâyou all the time,"
she declared. "You were the game
keeper." The man looked repentantly
back.
"I really didn't mean to," he pleaded.
"You see. I only expected to stop a mo
ment and pass on. But then that seem
ed uncivil, and so "
"And so you merely deceived us in
stead," laughed Mrs. Lincoln. "Ethel,
dear, this is Ellerslie, bad a*k ever."
"No, no," he protested. "It was my
cap that deceived you, not I. At first I
hnruly appreciated the situation, and
then âit seemed too late. And I never
hoped to see you again. But when you
spoke of my mtrther, I began to think
who you might be, and, of course, the
name on the locket settled it. Indeed,
I was innocent."
Mrs. Lincoln laughed.
"Certainly you took the tip badly
enough."
"But I still have it," he asserted,
"and always shall, if only as being the
first morey I ever earned."
As host, Ellerslie's duties kept him
busy through the afternoon, and it was
WW
Why couldn't Ido the same? I broke
out in a sweat. I strove to bring up*
arguments against my sitting In the
game and couldn't. Luck whispered
that it was with me, and it didn't seem
possible that I could lose. Never be
fore had I felt so strongly that it was
my night. I arose and walked up and
down, the room. I could- hear my
blood singin'. I turned and looked at
the bo>s, each one with, an expwession
of eagerness on his face. I. felt my
self superior to them' I could beat
them. There they sat, completely
within the power of my skill and my
luck. I could win enough to pay back
the money that I owed, and with my
wages I could buy clothes, and I
needed 'em. Suddenly I rushed oat
of the house, and I ranâran all -the
way to the âhome of the mill .ownerâ-
snatched his money out of my po< ket
and gave it to him. I told him what
I had gone through with, and he
turned pale and took hold of the" man
telpiece to steady himself. 'My son,'
said he, T have been all along there
(only I didn't run awayâUntil after
ward). They caught me and brought
me back, and it was only by the grace
âof human nature that I didn't go to
the penitentiary.' "
In the company there were three,
young fellows. The old man's recital
had moved them. "And did you play,
again. Uncle Lim?" one- of them in
quired. .
"No, I didn't- And although it may
appear parrow in me, let me say'
that a playin' card shan't cbme into
my house. In itself a deck of cards
is innocent enough, and so,is a bottle

counts, that nearly every gambler .be

for instance. Nearly all men like a

Whose business is it? The money be-,

earned. Understand, now. I ain't

a human nature sort of way for the â 
benefit of these boys. Don't bet on any
thing. That's the safest plan. If there's
no fun in goin' to hoss races unless you
bet, dc-nt go."
"Bat haven't you bet on roosters?"
Old Brlzintine inquired, looking wise. â¢
"Well, I have seen the feathers fly .

Then it was a sound which sent the
â blood coursing through every vefti,
aousedr. the soul's deepest reverence
and bmug'ht together men in one com
mon brotherhood.
'As the sound of the -horn signaled
the giving of the law which was to
lead mankind and stand for life's
moral and spiritual obligations, along
the ages, the multitude bowed with
feelings of awe and. humility.
.The sounds were new to the ears
of the people who -listened to their
echoes along the mountain, wondering
see the distant -tone repetitions.
And when thÂ» people mw It, they removed,
and ttood afar off. they said unto Moses.
"Sptak thou with us. and we will hear; but let
â  not OoU speak with us, lest we die."
The fear then in the hearts of the
multitude was significant. They
rcalksed the Iraptfrt of the occasion,
which had been, signaled by the blasts
of, the horn. So, from the very, first in
troduction of the instrument its sounds
have generally had "a, significant mean
ing and purpose. " '
. How well one can picture the scene
at Mount Sinai when the people trem
bled -and stood afar off when Moses
bade them to fear not; that God had
came to prove them and* that his fear,
might be.beforti thtir faces* that they
sin not. â¢' .. â¢ .
The sounding of the horn on an oc
casion so" prolific wrth divjnely p.oten
tiar Incidents naturally, brought the
instrument. Into use and prominence
during special spiritual* exercises and
ct-letorations, but. later its brazen notes
were heard In t'me of war.
They were also heard In 'time's of ex
treme jubilation and in. th'e temples
of the Jews on their! days of rejoicing
and on the day of atone*ment. .
In Leviticus, xxv:9, i 3 found-'the fob

Then Vhalt thou cause the trumpets the Ju

And even in. t hi * age of "advanced
thought." the Jew,. following com
mandment and the vo'tce bf tradition,
assembles # in his temj.le to' hear the
sound from the shophar.
What effect must such "tbnes is
suing from a holy pl.ace have upon the'
hearer?. They are not musical" sounds,
for their loud, piercing n- tes, with no
range or compass, hav.e never been
found adaptable to concerted music'
But is this description *n..t -exactly
and'strangely in accord with the tones
from the modern horn, the horn with
which :the jubilant man and â¢ youth,
woman and girl, of this period give
vent to their joy at the birth of the
c hristian new year?
Try as you will, you .can get n< thing
but a piercing,' shrill or inharmonious
tone from the tin instrument, and like
the ancient shophar, its tones - are un
musical, having neither range or com- .

In Numbers, chapter xxxix: 1, we
find an Injunction as to the use of the
trumpet.
Therein the people are commanded
on the first day of the seve'nth month
to hold "an holy convocation," to do no
servile work, it being "a day of .blow
ing of trumpets unto you"âa feast of
the trumpets.
Hsre is demonstrated the giving up

Once more this proves that the mod

all It's many smirks at tradition, with
all its vainglorious boasting of a re
finement overshadowing and even thor
oughly ecljpslng the primitive ages, fol
lows closely the precepts inviolably set
h.v .the great forefathers, whose, obe
dience to-divine commandment was, in
view of modern usages, no more loyally
observed then than flow.
The skeptic may say that to-day's
outpourings of joy lack thought, are in*
dulged without the .slightest religious
sentiment, have .no relationship with
the very same movements and same
" trumpetings that characterized the day
when the law was given from Mount
Sinai, those periods when joy and vic
tory and holy festival influenced the
early peoples of the earth.
Who will say that there is no feeling
of thankfulness in the hearts of the
nation when, with horn a-blowing and
tlags waving, it gives vent to its Joy
over victory or any great national
event?
The ancient New Year's service, ob
served in the synagogues even at this
period, is considered one of the most
impressive in the Jewish liturgy. It is
composed of three parts, which refer,
respectively, to the sovereignty, justice
and mercy of God, and as each part is
concluded the shophar is sounded from
the pulpit.
The first part. "Malchioth," proclaims
*'<>d the universal king.
The second part, "Zichronoth," em
phasizes that God remembers the work
of the world and visits all creatures,
antl that "nothing remains concealed
from his eyes."
The last part. "Shopheroth." speaks
of the scriptural shophar, and especial
ly as it is connected with the giving of
the law on Mount Sinai, when its tones
were first heard, and also with refer
ence to the time when the "great
trumpet" will be sounded "to declare
the universal triumph of liberty and
: eligion."
Ip a poem sermon founded on pas
sages from the Talmud, by the Rev.
Isidore Myers. B. A., in Montreal in
1897 (5657 Jewish year), the following
occurs:
Wliat solemn thoughts each blast compels!
At every sound our besom swells;
Our soul Is stirred by every note
That lssuo9 from the shophar's throat.
The flfrt. which "Malchioth" is named.
In which God's sovereignty's proclaimed.
Commemorates a fact sublimeâ
Recalls to mind creation's prime.
When God. creating, cut of nought.
This world Into existen-e broughtâ
This universe by wisdom planned.
And framed by hfs almighty handâ
Whos-5 order, beauty, harmony.
We everywhere can .plainly see;
Whose every part, below, above, '
.The Impress burs of gracious love.
The shophar's voice does first record
The coronation of the Lord. .
Thus, from its first mention up to
the present period, has the shophar
been given the ' most profound and
grave consideration. .
Besides the sounding of the horn in
the 'hour of religious And Joyous .festi
val it was brought into use in time of
' war fo summon ' and. assemble the
'army, and in this â¢respect it is first
mentioned in Judges, iii:27: â¢
And it tame to pass, when he was come, that
ihe blew a trumpet in' the mountain of Ephraim.
and the children of Israel went down with him'
from'the mount,'and "ie" before .them.
Subsequent verses relate the defeat
of 10,000 lusty "men and ' the downfall
of.Moab, much resembling'the bloody
conflicts of later centuries, sans ma
"chtnery of modern -warfare.
And here we find the horn brought
into, military use, which is a long step
â  from Its Initial -requirements, when It"
served to bring the people' together to
.hear the law read amid the thundering
and lightning and darkness which after
prevailed and filled* the assembled mul
titude with awe and fear.
- After all. in comparing the-past with
the present thefe seems but the dif
ference-' in the manufacture, design and
: manipulation of material and the ad
â¢ vantages In these times of having more
powerful and more scientific imple
ments with which to annihilate a foe.
Indeed, it is do.ubtful whether anything
could be more effective on a modern
'battlefield than the slaying of 10,000
valiant men, as was done by the Is
raelites who answered the shophar's
â¢'.call to arms. .
The Bhophar has been utilized in
other than times of law-giving and
â¢ war, for it is told in Isaiah xxvii:l3:
And It shall come to pass in that day, that
the great trumpet shall be blown and they
>' snail come which "were ready to perish In the
land or Assyria, and the outcasts In the land of
Egypt, and shall worship the Lord in the holy
mount at Jerusalem.
The prerphet foretold that the sho
phar should announce the recall of the
: people -from exile. Therefore it is seen
how, stride "by stride, the shophar, the
horn or trumpet, grew in use and favor

By Ruth Sawtelle
THE raindrops pattered down as
merrily and musically as If an un
expected shower were a most de
lightful thing. They washed the
pavement to a fresh red, making
tiny rivulets of the gutters.
But Phyllis Dalrympls was not occu
pied with admiration of the raindrops'
pranks. It was provoking! Ten min
utes before there had not been a sus
picion of rain. And here she was cooped
up on the tiny piazza of an apartment
house, without the remotest hope of
rescue till the rain should nlease to
cease. How empty the street seemed,
too!
A lone pedestrian! Enviable creature,
with rain coat and umbrella, sauntering
along as if being out in the rain were
' the pleasantest thing imaginable. And
nowâwhat an odd young man he was,
stopping right in front of her to watch
the tiny river swirl and divide upon an
obstructing brick!
"I beg your pardon, sir, but could you
possibly let meâ" Her voice faltered.
Herbert Ward wheeled about and be
held, perched on the top step under the
narrow shelter, a most alluring picture
of distress.
"Can I be of assitance?" he began,
drawing nearer, hat in hand. "You were
speaking to me?"
THE SAN FRANCISCO SUNDAY CALL.
The vision stiffened from Its appeal
ing attitude.
"You must be mistaken, sir. I do not
recall having met you." Then, hastily,
at his look of injured surprise, "Oh,
yes, yes. Forgive me. I did speak to
you/ Oh, please don't go away and
leave me now!"
The bewilderment on Ward's face was
so very frank that the girl broke into a
ripple of laughter. '
"Really, I must ask you to forgive
me again. I do not mean to be rude.
But it was funny to see you looking a3
overcome as I felt. There! That smile
makes me sure you are good-natured,
and If you'll come up out of the rain
I'lltry to tell you."
Ward accepted with alacrity.
As a matter of fact it was not rain
ing much now, but the big umbrella
and Its stalwart owner were excellent
company in the deserted street.
. "I almost believe I like uncbnven
tlonality," said Phyllis, picking her
way as a dainty woman will. "It's so
soâwell, different from everyday."
"I am convinced that I like uricon
ventionality, if this is it," responded
Ward.
Phyllis looked reproachful.
"This was what I thought about it
before I first spoke," she said hur
riedly. "Of course, we don't know each
other at ahâ"
"Worse iuck!" said a voice at her
side.
"But I need to be rescued, ana
he's apparently nothing better to do
than rescue me. He looks trust
worthy, and after he takes me to Mrs.
Walker's where I can send for the
carriage, we shall never see each
other againâ"
"Never see each other again! Oh, I
say, after I do my bestâ"
" âAnd as I am perfectly sure"â
with no hesitation to show that she
heard a word of the protestâ"from
his appearance that he would not
dream of taking advantage of my
confidence. I think I shall run the
risk of appealing to his generosity."
They .walked for a minute silently.
Then she stole a glance at his clear
cut face, flushed with mortification,
and relented.
"You are doing me such a favor"â
more geniallyâ"that I don't mind
telling you that I was horribly fright
ened after I spoke, and I truly beiiev*
I should have run away the minute
you turned if it hadn't been for the
rain."
"Thank heaven for rain!" he mur
mured, so fervently that they both
smiled, and caught each other in the
act.
"But I really think it's not raining
a drop now," she said. "There's noth
ing left but the sprinkle from the
trees."
"It would ruin your frock in no
time." And he gave the exquisitely
IN RETREAT
THE dog beside her growled, and
the woman, looking up from her
novel, saw the man coming down
the path, fishing tackle in hand.
The path was overgrown with weeds
and there were few indications that it
was used except by the cattle coming
to the creek for water.
The dog arose, alertly pugnacious,
and the fisherman suddenly became
conscious of the fact that his favorite
spot was pre-empted.
"I fear I must crave your protec
tion." He took off his tweed cap with
humorous gravity and smiled, first at
the woman, then with a conciliatory
air into the face of the bristling dog.
She took the dog by the collar and
drew him toward her.
"I can at least offer you a reprieve
from sudden death." She held the ani
mal with a firm, white hand, and Fer
roll ;oosened his grip on the fishing
rods he had intended using as a club
should the necessity arise.
"Perhaps he is stickler for etti
quette," he suggested, "and might re
gard my civilities with lessâerâani
mosity) if I offered him my card."
T must admit he shows more ami
ability toward people to whom he has
been introduced."
He took a cigar case from his
pocket and offered it to her, his name
printed In gilt letters on the side.
"Kindly introduce me to him prop
erly," he implored. "I wouldn't fur
ther offend his sense of propriety for
worlds."
She patted the dog on the head, and,
pointing toward the newcomer, made
the introduction with exaggerated po
liteness. ,
"Billle, most able bodyguard of an
unprotected spinster, allow me to make
you acquainted with one Dr. James
Ferroll."
"Quite charmed, old fellow, I assure
you," Ferroll bowed extravagantly.
"You'll excuse my not shaking hands?
You will? That's exceedingly kind, for
I would be slightly nervous about try
ing it on first sight."
"He will behave properly now." She
paused, evidently expecting Ferroll to
continue upstream.
gowned little figure another openly
approving smile.
â¢'But of course," responded Phyllis,
"I couldn't permit myself to presume
upon your kindness when I don't
really need you, and you see the sun
is trying its best to shine this very
minute."
"May failure attend its efforts!
That isâl meanâyuu know how very
uncertain such weather is, and if I
allowed you to be caught again I'd
never forgive myself."
"Oh, you wouldn't think of it again,
of course." she laughed coyly. "But
I should be desolated if I caused you
to miss your appointment. It's quite
a little nearer 3 than it was, you
know."
"Hang the appointment! Oh, I say,
I beg your pardon, you know. But
really I'm having such a good time,
I'd forgotten. And it's a bore, any-

"The appointment?"
"Yes, a beastly duty, you see. You
wouldn't mind my unburdening my-
self? I'm Just in town for a few
weeks on business and an old school

that which I'm to present this after-

only been some one like you. nowâ
"Oh, ybu really mustn't say it!*.'
came a queer, muffled voice.
"Ward looked down to see a very
pink face, a pair of unaccountably
roguish eyes and a tempting mouth
that twitched at the corners.
"Why mustn't I say it?" he persisted.
"Hang conventionality! There I go
againâbut hang it, anyway! Here I

"If you Vouldn't mind,!' he spoke,
hesitatingly, ."I will ask permission to
fish here; in fact, I have h/-en dream
ing about this very spot since my vaca
tion last summer. By Jove, I've caught
some beauties here."
In less than an hbur she had dropped
her novel on the grass by the side of
the now placidly sleeping Billle and
was taking her first lesson in the art of
bass fishing.
When 6he finally took up her novel
and hat preparatory to leaving he
looked at her with frank friendliness.
"I'm going to.be here a month. I
hope I will have the pleasure'of seeing
you again?" â¢ .
"Billie and I spend hours in this
spo.. every day. If you do much fish
ing you will probably meet up with
us occasionally."
Next day Ferroll had been in luck
and half filled his basket when she
reached the creek.
"Good morning, Billie," he called
out. "I hope we. are on friendly terms
to-day?"
*The dog sniffed at the basket of
fish, then lay down on. the coat Fer
roll had discarded.
"That's right, old fellow, make your
self at home. T hope he doesn't ob
ject to smoke?" He-looked at Miss
Winchester inquiringly, carefully
placed his rod in the forks of a con
venient bush, ana liS*s*Â«igar prepara
tory to a few m'oqtes'.chat.
"You are rather a plucky woman,"
he looked at her admiringly, "but why
did you come absolutely alone?"
"That's the nice part," she fastened
a wreath of green leaves around the
neck of the slumbering Billie. "I -was
â¢ tired of everybody and. if. you must
know the exact truth, I ran away to
"keep from being, married -for my
money. I had'an idea that a match
making friend was concocting a
scheme to deprive me of my liberty."
Ferroll showed a sudden interest.
"We have a bond .of sympathy," he
said, watching his creditable perform
ance at making smoke rings in the
calm summer air. "I have, an aunt JfV
Newport who was absolutely deter
mined I should visit" her this summer.
She had picked out a rich old maid who
owned a lovely cottage, and had it all
planned that I was to go. to see and to
conquer said spinster. So, you see, I
came down here to keep from being
' forced Into marrying for mdney."
'T used'to know some people in New
port. What's your aunt's name?" she
asked with a pretense pf idle curiosity.
"Mrs. Fenldn. She's been there for
the last three years only." And his
observation being concentrated yon his
newest smoke ring, he failed-to see the
crimson that flushed her face when he
mentioned the name of her, own next
door neighbor at Newport.
* * â¢ .*. *. ' *
Billle's mistress sat under* the tree by
the creek one day until she had finish
ed her book, and still Ferroll had not
appeared. â¢
She leaned over and patted the doga
head. ; . t ,
â¢ -It's the first time in three weeks
that he has not been here first, Billie,"
she said.
â¢ Billie gave a snort that either ex
pressed ridicule for the anxiety in her
voice, or disapproval of having his ears
rubbed the wrong Way. Then he sud
denly sat up to listen, and in a few
minutes Ferroll came down the path.
For the first time he came without
his fishing tackle. He threw himself
down op the ground beside them and
scowled into the dog's welcoming eyes..
â¢ Billie, I want you to know that I m
an egregious idiot. Perhaps you will
be somewhat at sea as to the meaning
of egregious, but I assure you ft s the
very worst kind of idiot."
Miss Winchester raised her eyebrows
â¢in sympathetic surprise.
J "Suppose you tell us how you became
aware of your mental defects." she
suggested.
He pulled the dog's head over on his
I dare not tell her how I dis
covered the fact of my idiocy. Last
night when I left the creek I was a
happy man. I had determined to come
down here this morning and ask you
how you would like to live in a house
with a doctor's sign on it. I had a faint
hope that your mistress would hate to
give you up, and would come.- too. to
look after you, you know. But. Billie.
that hope is as dead as a doornail. I
had a letter from my aunt this morn
ing and she mentioned casuallyâoh.
yes', darn casuallyâthat she was glad
I had postponed my visit, as Miss Julia
Winchester was not at home, and she
would not have me miss having a trial
at winning her money for anything.
The woman sat perfectly -quiet while
he continued his confidences.
"Now she would always think I Was
after her money, you unsympathetic
brute, and to make matters worse, I
have kept her amused 'for three
with jokes about the old maid at
Newport. Billle, do you think there is
a living woman that would overlook
being called an old maid?"
She reached over and took hold or
one of the dog's maltreated ears.
"Lend me an ear, Billie. You ought
to be a well-trained dog.'lor I have
spent hours on your education. Get
up and express nicely to the gentle
man your overwhelming desire to live
in a house ornamented by a doctors
Si Then she managed to force her head
away from Ferroll's shoulder long
enough to add another sentence. .
"You might state that your mistress
has a fondness for egregious idiots.

In; baseball .the teams this season
.were led by Mike Fleher's Tacomas.
There were six teams in the race and
the season was divided in half. Ta
coma, under the. leadership of Charlie
(Iraham, a'Santa Clara College boy,
forged to the front and held a lead
and won the pennant. # The winner Oi
the second series was to play Taco
ma, but Tacoma again proved / its
worth by winning the second half. It
was a nip and ruck race and the "fans"
enjoyed fast baseball. Many of the
players were drafted by the National
League. Taeoma's great showing was
due to the splendid pitching of Ovie
Overall, fresh from the University of
California, and "Bobbie" Keefe, late
of Sahta Clara College. Joe Corbett,
brother of the ex-champiori boxer, was
engaged by Hank Harris and pitched
splendid ball. The Frisco team got in
to the running, too late, although it
made a "Garrison" finish. Los Angeles
was a factor in the contest and gave
all the teams lot of heartaches. "Jim"
Morley spent lots of money in the hope
of winning the pennant, but failed. Al
though the baseball season closed in
the East some months as late ar
fhis day teams are contesting all over
the. State. This, proves that our cli
mate is the best in the world for the
national game.
Tennis has been given a great im
petus during the past twelve months
by reason of the free courts in Golden
Gate Park. Each day th? courts are
crowded with players and clever
racquet-wielders are being developed.
Tournaments have been held each Sun
day and the best .players in the city
and vicinity have participated. But
the. player who stands foremost this
year is Drummond MacGavin of the
University, of California. Although
just 23 years of age and out pf college
he is rae best player in the West and
his defeat of Alfonso Bell, the Cali
forniap who went East and defeated
the cracks there, proves him one of
the best men in the country. Mac-
Gavin first gained prominence by de
feating Grant Smith for the State
championship. He next challenged
.Bell and beat the veteran in close
matches. MacGavln is a modest young
fellow and a true sportsman. He has
wonderful staying qualities and pos
sesses perfect strokes. He developed at
the California Tennis Club's courts,
this city. He is now journeying round
the world and expects to be in London
In time to play in the championship
events. He will contest against the
wonderfully clever Dougherty brothers
of England. We will probably lose
MacGavln, as he intends taking up
residence in South Africa.
The fame of the Sutton sisters is too
widespread to demand further exploit
ation, but, suffice it to say, little May
Sutton went to the Far East and up
held California against the best women
players in the country, bringing home
the championship.
Polo is a game that can only be par
ticipated in by wealthy men. -In order
to play this rich-man's game one must
have a string of ponies and have a
doctor on your staff to attend you in
the event of injury. Down at Burlin
game the Tobins. Walter Hobart, An
drew McCreery, Tom Drlscoll and oth
ers are winning fame by daring work
on the polo field. Driscoll has been
playing wonderfully well this year and
is considered one of the foremost
ers of United States. While n.ast
he played with and against the Goulds
and showea ntmseif capable of playing
in such fast company.
Eugene Hildebrand, formerly of Pet
aluma, leads the jockeys of the country
and is picked by experts to be the lead
ing rider of the world. During the past
season he led the Eastern jockeys by a;
wide margin. Among the many win-;
Tiers he piloted across the wire was Art-!
ful, the winner of the Futurity, one of
the richest events of the year. From!
apparent obscurity, Hildebrand sprung!
into prominence and now commands an!
enormous salary. It is reported that
he will ride next year for Harry Payne
Whitney at a salary of $20,000. He will
probably earn $50,000.
Floyd McFarland and the two Down
ing brothers of San Jose are upholding
California on the Eastern cycling
tracks. The trio have won innumera
ble prises, but have done nothing dur
ing the past year to equal the work of
Otto Zeigler in years past. The cycling
clubs of this city and vicinity are keep
ing alive the popular pastime, and by
dint of fast riding are proving that the
Western men are no "slouches" when
it comes to pedaling for honors and tro
phies. Indoor cycling is becoming quite
popular, too. It is in the nature of races

on "home trainers." These events have
become very exciting and have brought
out the best riders in the State. The
contest for the handsome trophy of

won by J. Troutt of the California Cy
cling Club, who broke the world's rec
ord for one mile.
BOXING CHAMPIONS.
This State has turned out more fin
ished boxers than any in the country.
This is due to the fact that fistic exhi
bitions are permitted here. In thl3 city
some alleged amateur club holds an ex
hibitidn *rc*?kly and once a/ month
devotees of the manly art are given the
privilege of seeing the best men in the
world contest. We can lay claim to
James J. Jeffries, because he is an
adopted son of California. He started
his ring career in this city and has
reached the topâhe is champion heavy
weight of the world. Jimmy Britt of
San Francisco is next in prominence.
Britt has mowed them all down In the
feather-weight and lightweight divi
sions. He won the championship from
Young Corbett by a decision given him
by Ref?ree Eddie Mervin Graney. He
might have annexed the lightweight
championship last October by defeat
ing Joe Gans, but he lost his head when
victory was in his palm and fouled the
colored man. Frankie Neal, a!?Â« of
this city, enjoyed the distinction of be
ing the bantam-weight champion of the
world. At an ill-advised moment he
was prevailed upon to cross to England
and meet "Kid" Bowker. The latter
wrested the championship by a hair
line decision. Neal was at a disadvan
tage because the referee would not per
mit him to wade in, as is the style in
this country. Bowker, who Is as clever
as Griffo, was able to outpoint Frankie.
They will be matched again and it is
safe to say that if the battle comes off
in America the little Californian will
regain his lost laurels.
Al Ahrens of this city invaded Eng
.and with "Philadelphia" Jack O Brien,
and before Al returned he had an
nexed the welter and middle weight
championships of England to his belt.
Al Neill journeyed to Australia a few
months ago, and to the surprise of his
friends, who believed, Al had shot his
bolt, he won the middle-weight cham
pionship of Australia.
Our amateur boxers have also won
fame. Sam Berger, the crack heavy
weight boxer of the Olympic Club,
journeyed to. St. Louis and defeated
two men for the championship of th*
United States. Berger is only 21 years
of age and weighs 185 pounds. He has
been boxing Aye years and has been
coast champion for two years. He is
getting bigger and stronger, and some
day Samuel may branch out, as did
Jim Corbett, and who knowsâhe may
be world's champion. Georgie Flnnlgan
also went to St. Louis and won the
bantam championship of the United
States.
Al Young of the Hawthorne Athletic
Club journeyed to St. Louis and de
feated H. W. Spanger. the best man in
the tournament, for the welter-weight
championship of the country. Young
is a natural fighter. He has been at It
five years and has had fifty-four bat
tles, with five decisions against him.
George Peterson of the Occidental
Athletic Club, Lew Powell of the Haw
thorne Athletic Club, Johnny Crowe,
Joe Carroll. Dick Hyland and Abe La
bel are sp'endld fighters who pose as
amateurs, but who really are semi
professionals, as they take prizes val
ued over the figure set by the Amateur
Athletic Association. If these boys
were reinstated and forced to fight for
trophies this State would annex every
amateur championship in the boxing
line.
Bowling has become so popular and
has so many devotees that it has its
niche in sporting events. The greatest
bowler developed on this coast, and
probably the best in the country. Is
Harry Leap. It was he who introduced
the game of ten pins as it is played to
day in this city. He is the organiser
and captain of the champion Eugene
team. This team has defeated the best
teams on the coast. It is composed of
Leap, Thorpe and Shave. When the
all-Ameiican trio visited this city last*
year the Eugene team was pitted
against them and the visitors won out
by a few pins. Leap made the phe
nomenal average of 226 in the five
games. Leap has won so many prizes
and so many championship events that

For The
American Girl
THERE are no women of any
country that dress the feet as
prettily as American girls do. In
fact no women who have such
pretty feet to dress.
Spanish women have tiny feet, but
they are too short and broad for real
beauty. And French women, by some,
mysterious process, always wear small
shoes, no matter what size foot they
have.
But the foot of the American girl,
whiÂ«b_ is as famous as her wit and
beauty, is always small enough to ex
actly suit her slender, thoroughbred
build, is exquisitely modeled, rarely
(nowadays) pinched, and dressed with
the utmost taste,' appropriately for
every occasion.
It was this side of the Atlantic that
women 3tarted the fad for the stout,
mannish cut of shoe for street and
country sports, and it took the Ameri
can girl to first refuse to play tennis
in French heels.
This doesn't mean that English girls
have not worn big calfskin shoes al
ways a lot, and frequently inappro
priately. Every one knows the Brit
ish girl's propensity âjust the reverse
of the Frenchâfor wearing shoes that
make her feet look large even if they
chance to be small. But their stout
boots are coarse in texture and. common
in cut. while though the American girl
uses' for heavy wear heavy boots, they
are of the smartest cut, the most flex
ible material and while never tight al
ways fitted to perfection, comfortable
over the joint and snug up under the
instep.
For a while she did make it a little
bit of a fad to accentuate the mannish
ness of her boots, her soles were use
lessly wide and thick, but even then
carefully fitted and most swagger in
cut and finish. But this season her
street boots are Just heavy enough
for protection, no useless weigh, and
as perfect, in make as her dancing
slipper.
Her outdoor shoes, high and low, are
of calfskin, softly dressed, or of don
gola kid, or a dull-finish leather. For
nice street wear shoes are a little more
pointed at the toe and with Cuban
heels, of patent or enameled leather.
For home wear, for afternoon recep
tions, for evening, shoes may this year
match the costume, and for dancing
they must. White and pink and yellow
suede or dull kid for dancing slippers,
or lace over satin, or painted satin are
best form.

at the finish. He uses the Australirfii

Galley came second in the four

the world. On November 21 in the
Olympic Club tank, with proper of
ficials present. Galley lowered the
world's record for a quarter of a mile,
swimming the distance in the remark
ably fast time of 5:59 1-5, 2 2-5 seconds
under the record. Galley believes he
can do better than that.
Ralph Rose, the giant Californian
now studying at the University of
Michigan, holds the world's records for
putting the shot. As he Is but a youth,
he will surely develop into a great
weight thrower.
Norman Dole of Stanford, one of a
large family of athletes, has vaulted
higher than any other man in the world.
In actual oomDetition he went over the)
bar set af 12 feet 1\ inches. This is â 
the world's record and there is-every,
hope that the Amateur Athletic Asso
sociation will allow U, as officials pres-v -
ent have made nroper affidavit that he
accomplished the feat.
Our sprinters are running in record
time and in the field events the rep- *
resentatives of this .State are equally
as good as the Eastern athletes.
With the foregoing records in mind,
I submit that California has a right to .
consideration for her athletes and al

ly populated centers, this State will yet
be accorded the deserved honor of pro

tumes bronze shoes are extremely good
style, and so are brown suede, alwaya
with stockings to exactly match.
Of course you can be very well dress
ed by adhering to patent leather for all
daytime dress occasions, but for even
ing a blapk or bronze slipper would
be inartistic dressing, and white,
though it can be worn with tinted
frocks, is only best style with white.
But quite as important as shoes to
match gowns are the stockings to
niatch shoes, and. there has never been
a season when such a"n # infinite variety
of colored stockings we're to be seen in
the shops.
â¢Browns in every possible shade of
onion -skin, mahogany, and docque de
roche. tones; biuts and purples; reds,
light and. dark and in all strawberry,
pond lily and watermelon tints', and
yellows, pale and oranges.
And newest of all, shaded stockings,
white at the hem and deep-toned at the
toe, and every shade of one color in
between; not a bit good taste, but nev
ertheless wieh some popularity.
The openwork stocking thÂ»t was en
tirely crowded out by the gauxe-mesh
stocking last year. Is coming in again
this winter, the openwork showing ela
borate lace designs and frequently inset
with lace.
It is still smart though eccentric to
have a monogram on the left instep.
And just at this season of outdoor
sports college girls and schoolgirls fre
quently embroider the flag of their
brother's college on the instep of a silk
stocking. Or a sweetheart's initials in
hi? college colors adorn a silk instep.
And all this colored silk embroidery
on stockings, and also the craze for col
ored hosiery, brings up the tormenting
question of laundering without losing
color or luster. The ordinary process of
boiling and rubbing means, ruined hosi
ery of the delicate sort.
Indeed, so heavy can the loss be from
careless washing of fine stockings that
a great many girls do up their own,
just as they do their laces and table
embroideries. Their plan Is to use warm
water made soft with borax and soapy
with castile soap. First they soak the
stockings for half an hour in cold borax
water, four teaspoonfuls fo a pall of
water. Then into a pail of water that
has just boiled is shaved a quarter of
a cake of soap with a tablespoonful of
borax.
The stockings are rubbed a few min
utes by hand, rinsed twice in cold
water and let drip dry In the shade.
Out of doors in the wind is best, but
surely out o* the sun. All of this means
not each laundering. And it's* worth
the trouble if you want to follow the
fad for pretty hosiery.Malf- Hour Witt) - Ux -Rorexirxx r*s

HUMOR
by a New Fun maker
OUR friends across the w^terâthe
English, the French, the Ger
mansâshake their heads, raise
their shoulders or- grunt according to
their respective codes when they say
that they cannot.appreciate or under
stand American humor. They have
tried manfully; the French have even
gone so far as to declare "Huckleberry
Finn" to be the creation par excellence
.of American letters. Our friends over
the pond will not, therefore, see.any
thing meritorious or even laughable in
the latest work of the latest American
humorist, "Cabbages and Kings," by O.
Henry. This because "Cabbages and
Kings" is in the' richest and most typi
cal vein of that same x-quantity whose
value is not yet discovered to Europe.
Mr. Henry (and let lt.be understood
that this is a pseudonym) possesses a
variety of fun entirely new and pecu
liar to itself. Incident, as with Mark
Â» Twain, bulks large in the make-un of
his humorous writings, but. to. rein
force this he brings to bear' a most
marvelous argot,'.not slang but rather
the patois of the man on the street.
This patois has litfje relation to the
classic slang of . George Ade or the

tongue, evolved out.of the author's owr

This is not a romance that Mr. Hol

SWEET
Poems of Childhood
THERE are two kinds of poems of
childhood: those written for chil
dren themselves to read and those
which the grown-un likes to linger
over. What Eugene Field wrote and '
what James Whitcomb Riley writes are
the poems of children that'are'meant
to sing themselves to the hearts of
children of a larger growth. To do this
successfully is to do much. 'Two books
of rhymes upon my table come from
writers who have done this thing suc
cessfully. The reading of their little
books is a great pleasure.
Rowland C. Bowman has collected
his verses about children (not for chil
dren, mind you) into a thin volume
called "Freckles and Tan." Twenty
five brief bits of rhyme that reflect the
heart interests of small todgers through
the whole gamut of emotions, from love
for "Our Old Ma-Cat" to "RoothV for
the Peg." Each of Mr. Bowman's
verses has to give some message of
innocent fun or spell some token of
endearment. All of them carry back
to the time when knickers and pina
fores were our badges of citizenship
and the world was very beautiful.
Here is how the writer sweeps away
the intervening years:
Now my memory turn* boy ward.
Back, way back to Billy Hood.
Back where duty uaed to bind -me
To the bucksaw and the wood;
Back, where Billy used to call me
Prom his yard across the way:
"Hoo-oo! Hoo-o*.! Hi. there. Fat-tee-ec!
Come on over here and play;
Come on over here to our house,
Bring your sling-shot and a club;
There's a bullfrog in tbe cellar
Slttln' underneath the tub."
Then I'd holler back to Billy:
"I'd come over if I could,
But I can't come Just at present;
I must stay and buck the wood."
(Rand, McNally & Co., Chicago;
illustrated.)
"Lyrics of Childhood," by Edward
Mayhugh, contains more varied verse
than Bowman's. Besides giving some
typical boys' rhymes about "The Bum
ble-Bee," "How to Burn a Heap" and
kindred bits of infant wisdom the au

The day is done and fn the west

And baby He? half sleeping.
Sleep, sleep, gently sleep,
While owls their vlgtls keep.
Idly dreaming.

A MORAL
Plus a Dull Tale
/T is hard sophisticated
reader to be wTOlly serious over
Sarah P. Greene's story, "Deacon
Lysander." I believe this is due to
the fact that the author has taken
herself so seriously, for like the books
of old time, moral, with an upper case
M, loomsJarge in the foreground, and
Dtacon Lysander, his sprightly wife
and the other characters of the story
seem to be moved entirely by the
finger of the Deity instead of by any
individual volition. "Faith, hope and
charity*' one expects to find printed
at the finis line, "and the greatest of
these is charity."
Uncle Lysander is what would be
rudely called a "come on" by the glib
tongued piccaroon of a large city. He
carries a monkey-wrench and a saw in
the bottom of his carpet bag when he
goes to Washington, D. C, and wears
"j/cube" whiskers and a beaver hat.
His wife, Candace', is a second Saman
tha. Together they leave the good .
old farm "back Hampshire way" in
quest of gayety and happiness. The
nation's capital seems to offer the
most promising field and thither they
betake themselves in their simple.
Arcadian innocence, beaming with
kindness and love for their fellow man.
They find trouble. The boarding
house where they have located them
selves proves to be a â  broken down
school for young ladies and the three
proprietresses are veritable vixens.
Between turning the other cheek to
the assaults of these Misses Dove and
hunting the wide city o'er to see if
there are not some darky children to
whom they may gratuitously feed
cream puffs or refunding? a poor, mis
guided woman her losses at the races,
Deacon Lysander and Deacon Ly
sander's good wife are kept busy put
ting the Sermon on the Mount Into
practice.
Stories such as this are valuable
form the viewpoint of ethics and the
religious life, and I doubt not that
many a person will be the better for
reading the same, but as fiction for
fiction readers this genre of literature
is not a success. Perhaps the fault
lies with the fiction readerâwho can
sey?

This book is MÂ«>. Frances Hodgson

weird little study of childhood the au
thor has put into story form that beau

a delicateness of touch and a tendc"

theme a story which has in it an ir

"Her Fiance" is the title of a little
book of short stories about college girls
from the facile pep of Josephine Dodge
Daskam. There are four of them,
bright, snappy and full of the typical
flavor of camaraderie that obtains
in Smith, Wellesley and Vassar. That
each of them has something to do with
the tender passion does no; -disqualify

writer of two continents; indeed, it has
been all of six months since Mr. Brady
published a story and in that time his
warrior compatriot in letters has
franked two novels with his potent
nahie. The last one, "Comrades in
Arms." is as good as any General King
has written and in that point be has

RITCHIE..
the advantage of the lately Rev. Brady.
A new hook by General King: always
means a new draught on war's alarms
and the excitement of battle, for these
are the condiments of the soldier's
books. This ktst story embraces the
Spanish war in part and reproduces
with spirit if not with absolute fidelity
some of the stirring incidents of the
short campaign. The author's charac
ters all bear the King stamp; there is
the usual daughter of the regiment, the
somewhat stereotyped mlsmated cou
ple and the familiar coterie of mar
riageable young men of the post. A
somewhat involved plot would prove
cumbersome did not General King cram
his tale full of livening incident.

In "Our Search for the Missing Mil
lions" a San Francisco gentleman not
unknown in legal circles tells of the
adventures which befell certain treas
ure dazzled Individuals of this city In
their quest of burled pelf. The inci
dents of their Inglorious return empty
handed and hot of heart against the
wily old sea dog whose tale had in
spired the chase after a will-o'-the-wisp
are still fresh enough in the commu
nity's mind to make a Teading of this
confession of one of the gold hunters
more than of passing interest. After
all is said and done In the matter of
7 protest and recrimination the reader
cannot but have a sly admiration for
tha patriarchal Old "Captain Brawn"
(his name is thus thinly disguised)
through the very force of his craft.
The rare old gentleman found his fish
and he gathered them safely Into his
net. A man who is passed a gold brick
here in San Francisco does not write
a book about it; If the gilded cube is
handed to him in the South Seas has
he then the better excuse to burst glow
ing into print?
(Brown & Power. 412 California
street; illustrated; price 11.)
At first sight the reader may suspect
the publishers of trading upon the sen
sational value of a tragic incident In
publishing the letters of Mrs. Nelly
Gore, the Oakland young woman who
met a violent death in the Paris studio
of a prominent teacher of music two
years ago. But upon reading the book
one becomes convinced that there is
enough worth In its contents to justify
its publication, irrespective of the sen
sational incidents surrounding the
â¢death of its writer. "Your Loving
Nell" Is the title. The contents em
brace the letters written home by the
young woman while pursuing a higher
musical education abroad. In them
selves they form almost a complete
story, telling as they do the intimate
things of the greatest musical cdnerva
tories and the life that is led by those
who have devoted themselves to music
study. One interested in the art will
surely find a great deal of fascinating
matter-in this book.

York; price $1.)
"Poems, Lyric and Dramatic," a
book of collected magazine verse
from the pen of Ethel-Louise Cox,
can hardly be said to sound any new
or startling note in poetical writing.
In almost every verse of her collec
tion the poet exhibits creditable skill
at the technique of creation, but lacks
any compelling strength of spirit and
inspiration. Her , lines upon Psyche,
her praises of love, her painting of a
May morning are but echoes of what
numbesless poets have sung before.
Miss Cox's spirit of song is not ro
bust, neither has it great creative pow
er. In the dramatic poems, notably
that one entitled "Combat With the
Dragon," the movement-h? strained
and the tragic periods founded on in
sufficient dramatic incident. In this
poem on the slaying of a dragon Miss
Cox introduces a noveltyâa dragon
singing his swan song: '
Then with bubbling blood.
It passed tn music wonderful and strange!

About the Writers
ONE of the most important retail
book stores in the,. Middle West
evolved a novel idea for the dis
play of "Old Gorgon Graham,'' the
new book by George' Horace Lorimer.
author of "Letters From a Self-Made
Merchant to His Son." A Window, dis
play illustrative largely of the pork
packing industry was arranged. Hams'
and bacon, as well as likenesses of
little pigs, were strung up around piles
of the books. . Over all Hung the sign
Graham &X'o.. Pork Parkers."
The result brought not oniy'large
sales but some complications". â¢ One old
German woman'came In and insisted
Upon knowing the price of the hams,
and actually. ordered one sent to her
home. After the display: had. ' been
dosed people came In for several days
asking whether this store were not the
new packing-house which fhey had
heard was established on* Cleveland's

O. Henry, who has brought out his
first novel in "Cabbages and Kings," a
rollicking tale of humorous doings In a
small Central American republic, is a
true soldier of fortune. He is still a
very young man, but he has lived a
varied life. He has been a cowboy,
sheep herder, merchant, salesman, min
er and a great many other nameless
things in the course of .a number of
very full years spent doing our West, ,
Southwest, Mexico, South and Central
America. Mr. Henry (which, of course,
is not his name) went about with a
keen eye, and supplemented it by a
ready note book, into which he Jotted
down his impressions and things note
worthy that happened his way. Ha
carried an abundant good fellowship
and humor with him,' and saw the
bright and amusing side of things, as
his stories bear sufficient witness. Tne
conjunction and contrast of absurdity
and dignity in both the plot and word
ing of his stories make them something
quite as original as the work of Mark
Twain, Bill Xye, or George Ad'e. In'
fact, Mr. Henry has quite Justified his
title as the' new American humorist.
"Frank Danby," which name appears
on the title page of "Baccarat." Just

HISTORYDEFAMED
.'. LONDON, -Dec. 31.âNot long: ago a
more or less official investigation was
made into the history of the pictur
esque Fleet-street - barber-shop that
for years -has 'been described by its
proprietor'as. "formerly the palace of
Henry VIII and Cardinal Wolsey."
The investigation committee's findings
have just been made public, and they
prove, conclusively that the place was
never a palace at all, and that neither
'. the much-married sovereign- por his
much-tried prelate'ever lived there.'
' â¢ This means that of the three London
establishments that Americans practi
cally. â  support because they believe
' them' :to. be interesting links with the.
pajst, -two are absolute fakes. It has 
beep. p6inted out 'in the London press
'only recently that while the th.ird of
these'places-, has real claims to historic
Interest, its rights to the distinction on
the Strength- of which it has been a gold
"mine #o. its owner is open to doubt.
>).,â¢ OLD. TRADITION UPSET.
7 ; To the thousands of Americans who
â¢\fia.vje* .visited ai)d patronized the quaint
Jitil'e' waste-paper, establishment in
\ Portsmouth street, Lincoln's -Inn
â¢'.Fields, that calls itself "The Old' Curi
"asity.'.?hop Immortalized by .Charles
Dickens,'.' it may "be rather a shock to
Kear ' that, its proprietor's assurances
. to - .the 'contrary "notwithstanding," - the
fcuildlng is. no more the one where Little
.V3tyÂ»irand .her grandfather lived than the
Fleet-street barber-shop is a 'former
/'residence of Bluff King Hal.
TbouÂ°gh it seems a pity to upset a
pleasing tradition! Investigation proves
.-thatâ (while "The Old Cheshire Cheese"
In Fleet street may have been visited
â¢ by "rjr.- Samuel Johnson, it almost cer
tainly was- not. one of his favorite
haunts and not the scene of his famous
, .symposia. â¢ with Bosweil and Oliver
Goldsmith. Yet probably nine out of
c.very ten Americans who visit London
make-a point-of either lunching o.r din
.ing at the "Cheese" in order to see
."Johnson's seat" there, just as nine
,'out 'of; every ten pay .visits to and in
. crease the revenues of "The Old Curi
osity Shop" and the "Palace of Henry
'VHP and Cardinal Wolsey."' .. â¢
; . 'SOT LITTLE NELL'S HOME.
' The so-called "palace" is a tolerably
good hair-dressing establishment; the
'"Old Curiosity Shop" carries on a fair
..trade *in waste -paper, and the "Che
' shire Cheese" really Is over 300 years
'â¢old and a first-rate place to go to im
agine oneself back in the London Of
Queen Anne and to get a real English
chop, a mug of "bitter" and some of
â the pudding which is the place's spec
ialty. Probably all three of these es
tablishments would be prosperous in
' any event, 'but it is simply and solely
because of the Americans, who pat
ronize them under the fond delusion
that they are what they pretend to be,
' that each is a little Klondike to its
â¢owners.
Only the shop's proprietor. Carter,
knows how many American men have
been shaved and how many more
American women had tbines done to
their hair at 17 Fleet street Just be
cause they believed the Immense sign
which tops the place. This distinctly
states that the place was "formerly tha
palace" of Henry VIII and Cardinal
Wolsey."
Probably, however, the number of
people who have been duped by the
claims of the "palace" is nothing; to
that- of those whom the "Old Curiosity
Shop'" has deceived. On the strength
of its claim, also made in big letters on
Its outer walls, that It is the one "im
THE^CALL
mortalized by Charles* Dickens." this
shop does a roaring business with
Americans who visit it on the etrensrth
of itiÂ» supposed associations. They buy
postcards bearing pictures of the place,
photographs and paintings of it (most
of the latter showing Little Nell and
her grandfather in the doorway!) and
Dickens' works in all sorts of editions
and at highly advanced prices.
PALACE IS SPURIOUS.
It has been said so emphatically that
"Wolsey's Palace" and the "Old Curi
osity Shop" are humbugs that the
statement should be substantiated
without delay. Regarding the first, it
was some question as to the desirability
of acquiring its "freehold" that led the
city officials to investigate its history
not long ago. Then it was shown that,
far from having ever been a royal pal
ace, the building'began its career as
m office of the Duchy of Cornwall in
the reign of Charles I, who, of course,
came a long time after Henry VIII. It
remained a Government office for many
years, but finally was turned into a
coffee-house, and as "Nando's" became
rather famous, especially as the scene
af a rather picturesque little incident
which started on his career the youns:
lawyer who finally became Chancellor
rhurloW.
Some years later, however, the place
became the home of a wax-works show,
rhis was at the beginning of the last
century, and after that its vicissitudes
were many. It has been a barber shop
for about twenty-five years.
DICKENS' SON'S DENIAL.
So far as the "Old Curiosity Shop" is
:oncerned, inquiry proves that it has
iot even the shadow of a claim to be a
Dickens relic. Not only is the Lincoln's
[nn shop spurious, but it is said that no
;xact original of the home of Little
Mell ever existed. Attention has been
"â¢ailed to a definite statement by
-'harles Dickens, the younsrer, which
settles the. matter for all time. This
was once made in the course of an
English magazine article and runs as
follows:
"With mere unintelligent and un
supportable fable I do not intend to
trouble myselfâwith the absurd cred
ulity, for instance, which Induces some
travelers to believe that the house in
Portsmouth street, Lincoln's Inn, which
tias in some inexplicable way come to
be labeled as the Old Curiosity Shop,
has anything in the remotest degree
to do with the story."
Perhaps it is only Just to add that
the shop, though in no way connected
with Dickens, is really quite old, there
aeing reason, in fact, to believe that it
dates back to the reign of Charles 11.
r Alt IS lIKAWS <71iOWUS.
The Americans who burrow through
the little Fleet-street alley known as
"Wine Office court," In which the
"Cheshire Cheese" stands and,
( nsconsed in its old-fashioned, pew
like seats, partake of the time-honored
dishes, are shown not only "Dr. John
son's former chair." but his "favorite
corner," with a smudge on the wall
behind it, produced, supposedly, by the
grease from the great lexicographer's

used to be among the best customers
of the place.
In the summer months the place can
hardly accommodate all the trans-
Atlantic folk who want to eat "where
Doctor Johnson did." Moreover, few
such customers escape without invest
ing rather heavily in the many "sou
venirs" of the place which are on sale
and which include books giving its
history, post cards, beer mugsâwhich
cost less than 6 cents and are sold for
GO cents âpipes, match safes and sev
eral other things. When its present
proprietor acquired the place, some
thirty years ago, it cost him $100,000,
and the valuation which he now puts
upon it is said to be $200,000.
NOT JOHNSON'S HAUNT.
To people who have thrilled at the
sight of "Jphnson's" chair and corner
at the Cheshire Cheese it may seem
almost like sacrilege to question the
genuineness of these "relics." But the
fact remains that while there is only
jne reason for believing that Dr. John
jon may have visited the "Cheese" ac
-asionally, there are quite a number of
them for assuming that he was not
sne of its steady customers and that
It was not the scene of his meetings

is another. Consequently he may have
gone there sometimes. But if he went
there so often and sat in the same
place so regularly that his wig smudg
ed the wall, why Is it that Boswell, who
recorded almost every movement of his
idolized patron and who is supposed to
have gone there with him, makes no
mention of the fact? "Bozzy" goes into
details about the Fleet street taverns
which he and Johnson, and occasion
ally Goldsmith, visited, but he says
nothing about the Cheshire Cheese.
And what is rather striking, neither
do the doctor's two other biographers-
Hawkins and Crocker.
From Boswell one would gather that
the Queen's Arms Tavern, which used
to stand in St Paul's Church yard, the
Cock Tavern In Fleet street and the
Essex Head, close by, were steady
haunts of Samuel Johnson and that his
favorite resort was the old Mitre, also
in the street of newspapers. For here
it was that, as his indefatigable biog
rapher says, "he loved to sit up late
and often made my head ache with
port," The Mitre was, in fact, the

Johnson, at which, as the disciple says,

ASTOR MARES
PEACE WITH
THE ANGLERS
Permits Them to Fish
in Thames Along
His Estate.
LONDON, Dec. 31.âN0 longer can
London anglers Justly accuse William
Waldorf Astor of obstructing their
sport. The Anglicized American multi
millionaire has seen a great awakening
light. The hostile attitude which he
has heretofore manifested toward fish
ermen on the upper reaches of the
Thames has completely changed. He
is now their friend and patron. Peace
now reigns between him and the
Thames conservancy.
Astor has withdrawn his opposition
to fishing; from the bank of the river
bordering his Cliveden estate. He has
gone further, and has actually brought
at his own expense a shoal of young
salmon from the Dee in Scotland and
the river Shannon in Ireland and
placed them in the Thames. Maurice
Enright, the expert angler of Castle
Connell, Ireland, was charged with the
responsibility of supplying the Irish
salmon, while a member of the London
Anglers' Association was sent to Scot
land to obtain a supply there.
The sudden change in Astor's atti
tude toward the anglers is said to be
due to the action of some members of
the Marlborough Club, who refused his
invitation to a fishing party he had or
ganized at Cliveden during the summer.
One of the clubmen told him openly, it
is asserted, that he could not partici
pate in his party while the Thames
conservancy and the anglers' associa
tions condemned his high-handed ac
tion in claiming exclusive rights for
himself on the river.
His conversion was accelerated by
the discovery that a number of dead
dogs and cats were finding their way
mysteriously to that part of the river
touching on Cliveden.
'Give me your hand, I have taken a
fancy to you.' " And Bos-well's ac
count leaves little or no doubt that it
was at the Mitre that Goldsmith and
Sir Joshua Reynolds so often joined
them. Nathaniel Hawthorne knew this
and, when in London, he made a point
of dining at the modern Mitre, which
stands near Temple Bar, on the site of
the ancient inn.
PEERAGE LIKES
PEANUTS.
Taugh t to Eat Them
by Americans.
Popcorn Also Finds
Favor Abroad.
â¦
LONDON, Dec. 31.âA little Incident
witnessed yesterday was rather amus
ing as showing how popular American
dainties of one kind or another are
getting in the most ultra circles of
English high society.
Into a well-known store entered from
her brougham a portly dame who was
recognized as no other than the Duch
ess of Buccleuch. Now her Grace, be
sides, being Queen Alexandra's mistress
of the robes, is one of the bluest blood
ed and haughtiest dames in London, as
well as one of the most ultra-English.
"I want one of your large sacks of
peanuts,"-said the Duchess to the clerk,
"and half a dozen packages of corn
for popping. You know the address,"
and swept out of the shop.
One doesn't know if the popping is
done by a ducal hand over the draw
ing-room Are at haughty Buccleuch
House on the embankment, or if the
consumption of peanuts accompanies
the progress of bridge parties there,
but that these comestibles are esteemed
in circles- where one would not have
supposed them even known Is quite
evident. They have been introduced
by the fair American members of the
peerage.
CHILDREN SIMPLY DRESSED.
Since the extravagant overdressing
of millionaires' children commenced to
exci*e comment among a section of
ma only women it has been noticed
that the children of the Duchess of
Manchester no longer enjoy luxury
that was hitherto lavished upon them.
It was estimated at one time that some
of her baby's dresses cost no less than
$100 to $150. She had a penchant for
Irish lace and linen and a store in
London known all the world for
the superior quality of its wares al
ways looked anxiously for the arrival
of a Manchester baby. When the nurse
and her charge were seen abroad in
the neighborhood of Tanderagee Castle
or in London people used to remark
Jocularly that the dress was worth
more than the baby.
All this is now changed,- and the Man
chester youngsters are no more con
spicuous than the children of ordinary
middle-class people.
The Duchess of Marlborough has al
ways dressed her children well, but
there is an entire absence of anything
remotely sdggestive of the ostentatious
display of wealth in their apparel. It is
hinted that the abandonment of ex
travagant dressing is due to the Prin
cess of Wales, who, when she saw the
tendency on the part of millionaire
mothers to be conspicuously vulgar,
commenced to dress her children In the
simplest fashion.
VAN ALEN'S NEW HOME.
So extensive are the improvements
and structural alterations at Rushton
Hall planned by James J. Van Alen,
the American millionaire, who has
bought the estate, that he will not
able to take up his residence perma
nently there for two years. Housing
accommodations in the little village of
Rushton are of such a limited charac
ter that Van Alen Is obliged to build a
number of small cottages for those who
will be employed by him when he
comes to setle down at the hall. A
residence for the engineer, who will be
responsible for the electric light instal
lation and the heating apparatus, is al
ready in course of construction.
The spacious lake in front of the hall,
which neglect has reduced to an ugly
swamp, is going to occupy the special
attention of the new tenant and is to
be a thing of beauty.

AMERICAN
AIDS POOR
OF BRITAIN
Empties Workhouses
Jos. Fels Buys
Land So Men
May Labor.
LONDON, Dec, 31.âJoseph
Philadelphia, a manufacturer. wi ose
wares are almost as widely advertised
in America and England as Sir
Thomas Lipton's are, has the satisfac
tion now of seeing a big move forward
for a scheme he proposed some time
ago to various conservative British of
ficials, who looked upon the Idea at
first as revolutionary.
When Eels came to London a few
years ago many of the English poor
houses were overcrowded with able
bodied paupers, who wanted work and
couldn't get it. The Board of Guard-'
ians had a particularly anxious time of
It. Charity was appealed to In vain to
relieve the distress, but continued de
pression of trade at the docks and In
general industry always kept the work
house full. Will Crooks, a member of
Parliament who came from the work
house, tried various schemes to tret rid
of the surplus able-bodied in the insti
tutions without much success.
Then Fels came on the scene and
suggested that those who were able to
work be sent on to the land. He of
fered the land, but the Local Govern
ment Board, which is the executive au
thority in the administration of the
poor law, could not see the practica
bility of the scheme. However. Will
Crooks and one or two others kept peg
ging awâ at the department, until at
last it gave permission to test the
scheme.
Fels bought a hundred acre farm for
$10,625 and placed it at the disposal of
the Board of Guardians free of rent for
three vears, with permission to pur
chase before or at the end of that time.
He asked no consideration for the use
of his money, but if the guardians are
unable to complete the purchase at the
time stipulated the farm will revert to
Fels in a vastly improved condition.
He has made similar offers to other
Boards of Guardians throughout Eng
land, and says that he is ready to find
any amount of capital for identical
enterprises sanctioned by the Local
Government Bosrd.
He recently offered to buy 1000 acres
of land for the board, wherewith to
test on a larger scale the plan now in
operation, and after considerable hesi
tation the offer has now been accepted
and Fels is looking around for the
land.
This millionaire American socialist
says he Is not animated by either busi
ness or philanthropic motives. Of
course, if the farms revert to him his
investments would yield a handsome
return through the enhanced value of
the land consequent on the Improve
ments made by the workhouse men.
In any case he is now recognized as
a public benefactor.
Sumpner's farm of one hundred
acres, which was acquired by Fels, is
situated in the heart of picturesque
Essex, about forty miles from London,
and here 100 men, young and old, from
.a congested workhouse, are back on
the land with spades and pickaxes.
The farm is miles away from the near
est village, and even its water supply
is three miles distant. The construc
tion of a reservoir became, therefore,
a matter of immediate necessity, and
in this work a large proportion of the
men are now employed. The erection
of laundries and living quarters is In
progress. It is estimated that this will
cost $8000, which will be defraved by
the Guardians.
The first object of the colony will be
to make a portion of the land yield
sufficient vegetables to satisfy the de
mands of the poorhouse.

signs all over the hall. These lights
threw their effulgent rays upon the
beautiful and prettily dressed maids
and matrons assembled, giving to the
scene the appearance of many stars
twinkling through rifts in fleecy clouds.
The walls of the big hall were ivy cov
ered while the refreshment-room and
cozy corner were walled and ceilinged
with the Oriental flowers and running
vines. The tables were decorated with
smilax in unique designs. A rustic
fence across the stage, covered with
clinging ivy, concealed the orchestra,
which, during the carrying out of the
well-arranged order of dances, dis
coursed delightful music. In its entire

the many guests of the parlor were sin

success.
Redmanship.
An effort is being made to have the
Improved Order of Red Men in the res
ervation of California celebrate Decem
ber 16, the anniversary of the cele
brated Boston tea party, when a num
ber of patriotic colonists disguised as
Narragansett Indians dumped three
cargoes of tea into the harbor named.
With this event arose an association
which in after years crystallized into
the Improved Order of Red Men, and
it is believed that the anniversary
should be fittingly observed every year.
The initiative in this matter was taken
recently by Prophet Charles N. Grant,
a charter member of Yulapa Tribe of
Santa Rosa, who on the date named in
vited J. P. Plover, George Norris, J. O.
Kuykendall, Otto Seeman, Ray Cor
risck, W. H. Brayton, E. D. Sweetzer,
J. D. Munroe, D. W. Kidd, W. L#. Du
bois, J. Fillipplni, Prank Hall, James
T. Butler and J. F. Stahl, the degree
team of the tribe named, to join in a
feast of corn and venison in a long
house in that city to celebrate the an
niversary of the tea party, the one
hundred and thirty-first. Sachem
Plover was the toastmaster, and after
the disposition of an excellent supper
there were long and short talks by all.
The visit of Great Pocahontas Annie
M. Bliss to Pocahontas Council, her
home council, last week was an un
usually pleasant one. She was accom
panied by Great Prophetess Minnie
Betts, Great Minnehaha Ida Wheeler,
Great Keeper, of Wampum Harriet
Janes and a large delegation from
Manzanita Council No, 49 and members
of other councils. When the great
chiefs were admitted they were wel
comed with the honors due their rank,
and as they approached the council
brand a curtain stretched over the
stump of the Pocahontas was drawn
aside and there was revealed in letters
of gold the words, "Welcome Great Po
cahontas." After the routine business
there was the adoption of a class of
palefaces by the adoption team, which
did better than It has done for many
moons. The work of Pocahontas Lizzie
Kemnitzer was particularly good, be
ing marked for the close presentation
of the dramatic effects required by the
ritual, being given with unusual em
phasis, gestures and modulation of
voice, which are requisite to produce
the proper impression on the palefaces.
It came nearer what the ritual de
mands than any that has been pre
sented ln this city for many great suns.
This chief was highly complimented for
the work she did on that occasion.
After the work there were addresses by
the great chiefs, and then Ernest C.
Stock of Manzanita Council, on behalf
of Pocahontas Council, presented to
the Great Pocahontas as a token of the
fraternal love of the members of her
council a framed photograph of the
adoption team and a beautiful sofa pil
low. Great Chief of Records Bliss and
others then addressed the meeting.
The group picture presented in this
issue is the adoption team of Pocahon
tas Cocuncil No. 8 of the Degree of
Pocahontas. The figures in the front
row are, reading from left to right;
Lizzie Stocker, first runner; Mabel

The adoption of by-laws for the gov

The Eastern Star.
The children's party given in Golden
Gate Hall by Golden Gate Chapter of
the Order of the Eastern Star last week
was a very enjoyable affair, not only
for the sixty or more little ones, but for
the large number of adults who were
"the audience." There was a pleasing
programme of muÃlc, vocal and instru
mental, and recitations by the children,
contributed by Ada Gilbert, Muriel
Clark, Marguerite and Violet Moebus,
Harold Stark, Rose Hardin, Ethel
Jones, Mariana Dohrmann, Lois Jones,

At the termination of the programme
there was an adjournment to the lower
hall, where the little ones were treated
to ice cream, cakes and confectionery,
after which the grown people were
treated to a collation. F. W. G. Moebus,
acting as Santa Claus, distributed
many presents to the children from a
big tree. **
Dr. Maude Noble, a well-known mem

There was a fine programme oi enter

SOME' LOCAL DEALERS !H ART AMD THEIR DUPES
â¢."The knowledge Of picture dealers
has its value, but iisten not to their
i 'Titicisms when your heart is touched.
The picture was not painted for them,
it was painted for you; for such as
had e yes capable of being touched by
simplicity and lofty emotions."
So saith Emerson, the honest essay
ist, who loved art well; but who loved
art. not for itself alone, but because it
is an expressionâa thoughtâof nature;
likewise, because it appeals to the
jf hearts of men, for their betterment and
consvJatjpn.

chronicler of studio dreams and actu
alities to ao disrate the picture dealer,
to whom you arlist-ifo'k must goâor
I think you mustâto' eAI or show your
"Well," Miss Baler arsued, cutting
little siits in the air with her riding
whip, "that's up to the conventions of
the drama. The original story is all
about Samurai heroh s, but the Ameri
can public is not gch-.z to stand for
that kind of dram?.. They've got to
have the love interest. And there you
are immediately up against it. Love,
as we nmlersiand it. is unknown in
Japan. Passion there is. of course, as
the race is perpetuated. But you have
to begin by ringing in the anachronis
tic love interest."
"You go on," I continued, "by intro
ducing a princess, hedged in by the
most exacting ceremonial in the world,
refusing a suitor proposed to her by
her father, and at the same time ac
knowledging her love for a man that
she has seen but once!"
"She is thÂ» darling of the gods, willr'
ful. motherless, spoiled,'? Miss Bates
contended without conviction. "Of
course the red book of American man
ners is a flimsy ex. u:;eâstill, it is pos
sible. You know how strange the truth
is. Of course, again, it is not probable
âbut then what plays are probable,
only Ibsen's? And then, as Willie
Winter says, you're in the dissecting
room."
"How about the Princess Yo San's in
terview with the geisha?"
"Oh, that, of course, is dragged in,"
Miss Bates put it. 'But it serves very
well to Illustrate her character."
"Anyway." I granted, "Yo San is
wholly charming; if she isn't all that
a Princess of Japan should be. And I
wouldn't have missed the play itself
for much The picturesâ"
"Yes, sir," Miss Bates cried, her
whole big heart in her eyes, "aren't
they beautiful? They may well call
Belaseo the 'wizard.' Oh, and the lit
tle touches all through the play. Do
you remember that scene where Yo
San turns her obi to the front, the
sign of the geisha? Any other man
but Belaseo would have given her
pages to say to Yakkuri. He does just
that. And every night it feels big to
me. And do you remember the ban
quet scene? T bow to Mr. Belaseo at
every stage of the game: but there are
two things for which he could abso
lutely walk over me, one that banquet
scene^âtwelve tables set. carp served
and eaten with chopsticks, pipes
smoked, stage cleared, all in no time."
"And the other?"
'The scene where Mme. Butterfly
stands watching for h?r husband at
the window of her shoji for seven and
a half eternal moments; not one word
spoken; not a movement madeâwhy,
. it's the most daring thing ever done
on the stage!"
"And you're going to do it here, this
said; "and your own playâ"
"My Own play?" she queried, opening
her eyes until the blue whites of them
grew into saucers.
"It's advertised," I informed her. j
"Well, Mr. has a large sizedâ"
she broke off, laughing, "and so I can't
do the 'Taming of the Shrew.' "
"So!" I said, "and that was on the
tapis?"
"Justâ" she laughed, even blushed a
little,, "the Katharine and Petruchio
scenes, William Winter's arrangement,
you know. Please believe that it is a
creed with me that there is only one
Katharine, Ada Rehan; only, I like to
try. And there's only one Juliet, Julia
Marlow, adorable âand only one Be
atrice, too, Ellen Terry."
We went back to Belaseo then and
Miss Bates said he reminded her of a
once-upon-a-time high school principal
of hers, A. T. Wynne, who said to her
one day: "My child, knowledge Is not
knowing a thing; it's knowing where
to get it."
"That's what Belaseo knows, where
to get everything," Miss Bates added.
"He had a two-sword man to drill the
samurai in the play. He had Sada
Yacco's dresser to dress the women.
He had Yetto, the Japanese artist, to
look after the pictures. Every detail
in them is correct. Not one person
â in ten knows it, but it is for the tenth
that Belaseo works."
She told us afterward something of
the wizard's methods with his players,
of her first efforts with the Yo San
part; how she had gone with a care
fully prepared conception of the role
to her maestro; and how he had said:
"That's fine; that's how Blanche
Bates would do there; now do it as
a Japanese girl would do."
"Of course," the actress pouted de
lightfully, "I went home and cried all
night. But next day, with the little
here and there things he had said, it
seemed to come to me. You believe
you can do anything Mr. Belasco says
you can. I know I should jump off
that bridge yonder If he told me to."
Then we sauntered off to the McAl
lister street cars and got somehow to
talking of Mary Shaw, "the most won
derful woman I have ever met," Miss
Bates cried. "You should see her some
times at the Twelfth Night Club," she
went on. "Four or five of us would be
talkingâbeing women it would natur
ally begin with personalitiesâbut in a
while some question of literature or the
drama would come up and, by Jingo!"
Pictures, and I to dig up "stuff" for
stories. But the force of Emerson's
comments was full upon me when I
learned, a few days ago, that certain
dealers were diligently "knocking" the
work of artists who had exhibited with
them, and thereafter withdrew their
pictures, because they refused to be
parties to "commercial methods."
Now, these "commercial methods"
consist of the following brief de
tails: The guileless artist sends his
picture to the dealer with the price
of $75 upon it. A possible buy
er drifts in. asks the price,
and is told it Is $90. The buyer likes
the picture and pays the price; the
dealer pockets the $15, and possibly hav
ing forgotten ab<mt the little incident,
doesn't mention it to the artistâand

Miss Bates slapped her knee with her
whip, "before you knew there'd be the
whole room listening to Mary Shawâ
you know how she can talk."
"It was one of my most recent and
delightful privileges to hear her," I
said.
"But she's bully," said Miss Bates.
And as she swung lightly off the car
and turned her brown, wholesome,
smiling face back toward me, I thought
there was another American actress
who was "bully."
FULL VALUE GIVEN
BY ALL THE LOCAL
THEATERS THIS WEEK
There Is value for money at every
theater In town this week. Chief
among the attractions is Blanche Bates
in "The Darling of the Gods" at the
Grand Opera-house. Pictorially the
Japanese play Is possibly the most
beautiful ever seen here. The story
also is taking, and Miss Bates as Yo
San, the ill fated Princess, adds largely
to her reputation. The support through
out a large cast is competent, and this,
the second week of the engagement,
bids fair to rival the first In its suc

the dealer, in perfect imitation of a
cannibal going to breakfast. The com

story's true. How many of you artist
chaps cap attest to Its truth?
But oh the other hand let it be said
that there are a few conscientious art
dealers in San Francisco, just as there
are a few conscientious doctorsâand
there really are some, though you
mightn't believe it. These men who

They're not doing earnest work." And
then out comes the insidious little ham
mer that "knocks" the unallled painter
and his picture.
And ln the deep silence of his studio,
where, to the leaping of his
pulses, he conceived the unpaint
ed thing; and then, bit by bit,
evolved it Into a tangible thing, with
an eagerness born of desire; then fin

love, something of passionate love,
something of friendship in the last
tender touches âall these tense mo
ments, minutes, hours, days and weeks,
with their hopes and their, cryinjr neces
sities, are condensed into an instant of
anguish. ~ And the little "knock" of the
dealer did it.
But the dealer isn't the only sinner.
There areâand I blush to say itâart
ists who have prevented the sale of
peculiar local, and even national fame,
is chiefly associated with the remark
able series of grand opera performances
that have been given by its manage

venture is on exceptionally ambitious
scale. There will be one hundred and

I am credited wttla in The Call edition

Realty, no! It is too. too much. In my

the afo; sheet, lit- the reins
of local musical empireâall, that is.
cot heid by my almost equally illustri
ous confrere of the Examiner, Asnton
Stevens. Tn pr-oof of this Mr. Metzger
devotes much space and more gram
marâunique and delightful until, like
one of the earlier pagans, one is almost
persuaded to the faith. Then one re
members the preacher and returns a
lowly and chastened reviewer.
But seriously, for the few gocd peo
ple that take seriously this hysterical
and unimportant little person (to the
rest I apologize for his obtrusion here):
In his New Year sheet, among
other sins, Mr. Metzger accuses
The Call critic of signing criti
cisms not written by her and of a
wanton breach of professional eti
quette. There are other accusations â
chiefly one of a policy of destruction
rather than of c*Onstructior. and aie!
Why not Something new if not true â
but these, coming from this source, are
beneath even philanthropic attention.
To tak? Mr. Metzger's first accusation.
He says: ' The sweeping denunciation
of the excellent Kopta quartet and'
Mrs. Oscar Mansfeidt which appeared
in The Call under the name of its au
thorized critic was written by Oscar'
â¢Weil, who has taken unto himself the
censorship of music in this city for
quite a number of years. The criti
cism appeared under the signature of
The Call's critic, and there has not
been a case in the history of music in
the world (sic!) where such a breach
of the etiquette of the profession has
been made."
As the quotation best serves to show
the ealih?r of the article in question I
do not apologize for it.
The Kopta criticism did appear
"under" my name. As my signature,
if anywnere upon this page*, is at the
head of it, the criticism could hardly
have appeared "over" it. The implica
tion is another story. Twice certainlyâ
and if my memory serves me faithfully
three timesâthe fact that the article
was written by another person than
myself was deliberately insisted upon.
This makes Mr. Metzger what? Either
of two quite unpleasant things it seems
to me, Mr. Metzger. Take your choice.
You have here stamped yourself as a
person of phenomenally careless and
Incompetent reading; or, worse, as aâ
well, as one in whom the truth is not.
I am unfortunate in one reaard.
whereby hangs this ta<e. I have always
found It necessary to attend a concert
in order to criticize it. Here I bow to
Mr. Metzgerâwho has not. Not unin
teresting in this connection, and as
evidence of the value of the Musical
Review's criticisms, is the fact that
Mr. Metzger's critique of the last Mi
netti concert was written and in type
before the concert took place!

WORK THAT IB ATTRACTING A IvOT OF ATTENTION.
Because of my aforesaid limitations,
and because I judged the Kopta con
certs worthy of the best critical atten
tion the town affords, I asked Mr. Os
car Weil if he would be good enough to
take a few notes thereof for me in mr
own unavoidable absence. He most
kindly consented, and I hasten here to
record my gratitude to the most dis
tinguished musical critic this side of
New York for this and many other
kindnesses. Any one caring to refer to
the article in question will find it on
page 19 of the Sunday edition of The
Call of November 6 and will find there
in my indebtedness to Mr. Weil fully
acknowledged. They will not, however,
find any "sweeping denunciations.*'
There Is none.
Quite charmingly naive Is the other
accusation. 1 received, for the last
Minetti concert what is called a ' per
jional" invitation. I have received
them before. Fpr the uninitiate thÂ«
â¢â¢personal" Invitation is commonly an
invitation to give publicity and praise
to the affair you are invited to. There
ate exceptions. I judged that the Mi
netti concert was not one of them. In
fact, as the publicity of these columns
had before been soughtâquite legiti
mately and worthilyâfor these affairs,
1 KNEW that the Minettl concert was
not one of the exceptions. It appears
that my judgment was entirely cor
rect. Among very much that was Rood,
for Mr. Minetti is here doing excellent
work, there were naturally points in
the performance to take exception to.
These, along with the praise and pub
licity given to the good work. I did
take exception to, in a short critique
that I intended to elaborate upon later.
Bat, behold! on the day following the
appearance of my criticism came a four
page typewritten letter of protest con
cerning my criticism from Mr. Alfred
Metzger. Like the "flowers that bloom
in the spring, tra la!" I could not see
what Mr. Metzger had to do with the
case. 80 I told him. So I told Mr.
Minetti, who in a subsequent letter to
me disclaimed any connection with Mr.
Metzger in the matter. But the spec
tacle of the pigmy preaching from the
bigger man's shoulders is not rare.
Mr.. Metzger, however, evidently be
lieved himself to be divinely appointed
for my chastisement; artlessly ex
pressed his pained surprise at my
breach of professional courtesy: wres
tled with my iconoclastic tendencies,
and ended up by threatening me with
a conspiracy against my freedom of
speech which "will begin to break out
in the New Year's edition of the Mu
sical Review, of which 10,000 codes
have been ordered for distribution"âif
I did not mend my ways!'.
But one has lost sight of the. point.
It is this. That the fact of my having
criticized the Minetti concert was not
animadverted upon. IT WAS THE
FACT THAT THE CRITICISM WAS
IN PART ' V 'AJDVERSE:"'

HEALTH OFFICER REPLIES
TO A PETIT CRITICISM
Kngan Scores Medical Editor in
Monthly Bulletin. Which Also Con-
tains Death and Birth Statistic*.
In the November bulletin just is
sued by the Health Department,
Health Officer Ragan takes occasion
to reply to the petty criticism of
Philip Mills Jones, editor of the Cali
fornia State Journal of Medicine, rela
tive to the "Household Health Hints"
issued by the Health Board. Ragan
says:
"The 'Health Hints to the House
hold' have borne good fruit, as evi
denced by the many testimonials re
ceived at this office as to their edu
cational value. They have been of
ficially recognized by many of the
prominent health officers of the coun
try, who have also sent written com
munications as to their worth, and New
York is about to take up this educa
tional work on similar lines. San
Francisco has been generously paid
the tribute by New York of inaugurat
ing this instructive movement. It i 3
but fair, however, to state that the
â¢hints' met with adverse criticism from
the callow editor of a local medical
journal, who failed signally in a simi
lar effort to educate the people in a
popular way through the columns of a
local daily newspaper in the matter of
guarding and preserving the health of
the individual in the community. His
rhapsodies, whJ*ah may have place in
a medical journal, found but scant
favor when submitted for popular
perusal."
Deaths during- November were 606,
which, on'an estimated population of
475,000, makes a death rate of 15.30
per 1000. Of these 393 were males
arid 213 females. The total births reg
istered were 471, which, however,
Rngar, says, is incomplete, owing to

sentence of sixty days' imprisonment
and a fine of 1250 for pasturing sheep
on a Government reserve, applied to
United States Circuit Judge William

the court has no power in a contempt
case to impose both fine and imprison

being about to leave for Montana ln
the evening. The application will be
presented to United States Circuit
Judge Morrow next week.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY. JANUARY 1. 1905
PAST YEAR BREAKS RECORD
More Realty Deals Than In Any Precedlny
Twelve Months.
Total Value Represented Runs Very
Near to $48,000,000. â¢
Baldwin & Howell, in their monthly
publication, the Buyer and Seller, esti
mate that the sales of real estate ln
San Francisco during the year that
closed yesterday amounted in value to
$46,000,000 and that the transactions
numbered 7000. The Buyer and Seller
was published on Friday and there
were two days to be included in the
returns to make them complete, but the
totals may not vary much from the
Baldwin & Howell figures.
Taking; 545,000,000 as the approximate
showing for the twelve months, it will
be .noticed by those who are familiar
with realty transactions in this city
that, as compared with 1903, the num
ber of sales has increased 300, while the
total amount of money represented In
the deals falis short of the total of 1903
by about $2,500,000.
In ihe sectional totals for 1904 the
50-varas are credited with 624 sales*,
amounting to $15,500,000; the 100-varas
with 365 sales that brought in $6,500,000;
the Western Addition with 16SS sales,
total $13,500,000; the Mission. Potrero
and South San Francisco, collectively,
made a showing of 2375 sales, amount
ing to $5,750,000; the outside lands,
which include Richmond and Sunset
districts, 1948 sales, amounting to $3.
-750,009. Concerning the general stabil
ity of the local realty market and other
phases, the Buyer and Seller says in
part:
PHASES OF THE MARKET.
' The number of investments has ex
ceeded those of any similar period in
the history of this city. This increase
has been chiefly in home buying in the
outspreading districts. As a conse
quence the individual amounts have
been smaller than in those years when
buying was rather circumscribed to the
more expensive sections of the town.
Thus the aggregated considerations, as
estimated, appear less than those for
the two previous years. Estimates of
this character can only be approxi
mately correct, and, when the differ
ence betwen them is as narrow as the
apparent 5 per cent reduction of the
last year from its two immediate pre
decessors, it can not be strictly in-'
ferred therefrom that the situation has
materially altered.
'The special characteristics of this
market during the last year have been
the steady trend of business, its stabil
ity under conditions that would have
adversely affected a less vigorous
growth, and a healthfui increase in
values. There have been no periods of
either marked activity or stagnation.
Each of the twelve months developed
about the same amount of transac
tions. Neither the Presidential election,
the large increase in assessments nor
the sudden appearance on the market
of large holdings had any effect in
either checking investments or causing
a break in prices. On the contrary,
there was no disturbance, while values
for individual pieces of property show
ed even and normal increase. The SsWi
Francisco real estate market met all
of the ordeals imposed on it unflinch
ingly, and came forth from them the
stronger for the experience.
"Considering the districts as between
the last two years it may be said gen
erally that in the 100-vara there was a
falling off, that the flfty-vara and the
Western Addition remained in nearly
the same condition, that there were
slight gains In the Mission, Potrero
and South San Francisco grouped, while
in the outside lands the number of
transfers increased from 1500 to almost
2000, and the amount from $2,500 000 to
$3,750,000."

Circulars have been issued by the

sion for examinations for inspectors of
hulls and boilers, as a result of the
damaging; revelations made during the
investigation of the Slocum disaster in
New York. Rear Admiral Kempff has
completed the examination of about
ninety steam vessels in this harbor,
and has found that United States Local
Inspectors O. F. Bolles and John K.
Bulger have done their duty without
fear or favor and that all the regula
tions of ihe service have been rigorous

One thousand and twenty persons,
mostly women and children, lost their
Jives by the burning of the steamer
Slocum because the hose was defective
when the water was turned into It,
and because the life preservers were
worthless.

their number in order to increase the

HEALTH OFFICER REPLIES
TO A PETTY CRITICISM
Kngan Scores Medical Editor in
Monthly Bulletin. Which Also Con-
tains Death and Birth Statistic*
In the November bulletin just is
sued by the Health Department,
Health Officer Ragan takes occasion
to reply to the petty criticism of
Philip Mills Jones, editor of the Cali
fornia State Journal of Medicine, rela
tive to the "Household Health Hints"
ksued by the Health Board. Ragan
says:
"The 'Health Hints to the House
hold' have bbj-ne good fruit, as evi
denced by the many testimonials re
ceived at this office as to their edu
cational value. They have been of
ficially recognized by many of the
prominent health officers of the coun
try, who have also sent written com
munications as to their worth, and New
York is about to take up this educa
tional work on similar lines. San
Francisco has been generously paid
the tribute by New York of inaugurat
ing this instructive movement. It i 3
but fair, however, to state that the
â¢hints' met with adverse criticism from
the callow editor of a local medical
journal, who failed signally in a simi
lar effort to educate the people in a
popular way through the columns of a
local daily newspaper in the matter of
guarding and preserving the health of
the individual in the community. His
rhapsodies, may have place in
a medical journal, found but scant
favor when submitted for popular
perusal."
Deaths daring November were 606,
which, on'an estimated population of
475,000, makes a death rate of 15.30
per 1000. Of these 393 were males
arid 213 females. The total births reg
istered were 471, which, however,

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SUNDAY. JANUARY 1. 1905
PAST YEAR BREAKS RECORD
More Realty Deals Than In Any Preceding
Twelve Months.
Total Value Represented Runs Very
Near to $48,000,000. â¢
Baldwin & Howell, in their monthly
publication, the Buyer and Seller, esti
mate that the sales of real estate ln
San Francisco during the year that
closed yesterday amounted in value to
$46,000,000 and that the transactions
numbered 7000. The Buyer and Seller
was published on Friday and there
were two days to be included in the
returns to make them complete, but the
totals may not vary much from the
Baldwin & Howell figures.
Taking 545,000,000 as the approximate
showing for the twelve months, it will
be .noticed by those who are familiar
with realty transactions in this city
that, as compared with 1903, the num
ber of sales has increased 300, while the
total amount of money represented In
the deals falis short of the total of 1903
by about $2,500,000.
In itie sectional totals for 1904 the
50-varas are credited with 624 sales*,
amounting to $15,500,000; the 100-varas
with 365 sales that brought in $6,500,000;
the Western Addition with 16SS sales,
total $13,500,000; the Mission. Potrero
and South San Francisco, collectively,
made a showing of 2375 sales, amount
ing to $5,750,000; the outside lands,
which include Richmond and Sunset
districts, 1948 sales, amounting to $3,
-750,009. Concerning the general stabil
ity of the local realty market and other
phases, the Buyer and Seller says in
part:
PHASES OF THE MARKET.
' The number of investments has ex
ceeded those of any similar period in
the history of this city. This increase
has been chiefly in home buying in the
outspreading districts. As a conse
quence the individual amounts have
been smaller than in those years when
buying was rather circumscribed to the
more expensive sections of the town.
Thus the aggregated considerations, as
estimated, appear less than those for
the two previous years. Estimates of
this character can only be approxi
mately correct, and, when the differ
ence betwen them is as narrow as ths
apparent 5 per cent reduction of the
last year from its two immediate pre
decessors, it can not be strictly in-*
ferred therefrom that the situation has
materially altered.
'The special characteristics of this
market during the last year have been
the steady trend of business, its stabil
ity under conditions that would have
adversely affected a less vigorous
growth, and a healthful increase in
values. There have been no periods of
either marked activity or stagnation.
Each of the twelve months developed
about the same amount of transac
tions. Neither the Presidential election,
the large increase in assessments nor
the sudden appearance on the market
of large holdings had any effect in
either checking investments or causing
a break in prices. On the contrary,
there was no disturbance, while values
for individual pieces of property show
ed even and normal increase. The Salh
Francisco real estate market met all
of the ordeals imposed on it unflinch
ingly, and came forth from them the
stronger for the experience.
"Considering the districts as between
the last two years it may be said gen
erally that in the 100-vara there was a
falling off. that the fifty-vara and the
Western Addition remained in nearly
the same condition, that there were
slight gains In the Mission, Potrero
and South San Francisco grouped, while
in the outside lands the number of
transfers increased from 1500 to almost
2000. and the amount from $2,500 000 to
$3,750,000."

damaging revelations made during the
investigation of the Slocum disaster in
New York. Rear Admiral Kempff has
completed the examination of about
ninety steam vessels in this harbor,

One thousand and twenty persons,

THE old year has passed into history, and it added thereto an
interesting chapter. Jt witnessed the rise of a new nation in
the emergence of Japan into the company of the great world
powers. This event differs totally from any past manifestation of
Asiatic energy. While war was the motive and the background,
it is not like the Asiatic wars waged by Genghis Khan and his
descendant, Tamerlane, japan has not merely made defensive war.
She has furnished the world with an example by the application
of modern science to military sanitation. Had this been done in
our Civil War hundreds of' thousands of lives lost by disease
would have been saved by science. Japan has shown expertness,
courage and patriotism in the business of destroying life, but she
has more than balanced this destruction by showing how life
cari be saved by scientific sanitation, and has taught the military
â¢iommissaFv of the western world the most important lesson it
has ever learned. End how the war may. it may be truthfully said
"that it. has done more physical good in the world than any war
since men fought. Its incidents are among the conspicuous features
of the yeir that is gone.
Of - equal importance to mankind is the part played by our
own country in advancing peace on earth and cultivating good
will among -men. The extension of arbitration treaties and the
reassembling of Ther Hague Peace Conference are shining jewels
in the crown of American diplomacy. In this connection we cannot
â¢forget .to give to < Jreat Britain the credit due for that great self
control which refused to make the North Sea carnage the caus<
of immediate war. Its submission to arbitration has wonderfully
â¢enlarged the field of that beneficent and bloodless resort for the
settlement of international disputes. As it directly involved an
?=sue of national honor, respecting an affront heretofore considered
expiable only in blood, a very high example has been set for the
naiior.s to follow. Jt has probably removed eight-tenths of the
causes and the risk* and the misery of future wars. King Edward,
by it, made for himself.a place in history as the peace lord, greater
â¢than that of any-war lord.
. At home the. year has been one of prosperity and achievement.
â¢It witnessed the accomplishment of the world's greatest work of
peace by bringing in reach the building of the isthmian canal. The
â¢'ream-of Jefferson and Humboldt has been made a reality, and
when -the work iÂ« done the people of the planet will all be its
.beneficisr:'-*. "and the glory it will add to the Star* and Stripes
will be greater than that with which any war could gild the flag.
Upon the whole it is doubtful if any year preceding it has
added as much to the safety and satisfaction of the race. With
â¢it- great history behind us we face the new year with stout hearts
and Co'.irage. It brings the. solution of new problems in oar own
Government and institutions. The President has mapped out these
problems, which call for the exercise of that power of the Govern
ment which the constitution gives it to provide for the general
welfare. President Roosevelt has seen clearly the provision that
must be made to conform the transportation policy of the country
to the welfare of the people, and with great unselfishness has
equipped himself for hiÂ« part of the task by refusing to again be
a candidate for the Presidency. In the year that is ahead there
will be. abundant need and opportunity to hold up its hands while
Jthey do the mighty work he has chosen for himself. â¢
As .we look from this day into the twelve months to come
they seem roÂ«y with prosperity and busy with progress. In morals
and materialities Americans are not content to stand still. They
have that noble .discontent which impels to self-examination in
search of faults within themselves that hold them back from highs r
achievement*, and they, frown upon that ignoble discontent which
would impute to other* the disaster or stagnation which are caused
by lack of.personal initiative and energy, thrift, temperance and
industry.
Our own State ha* occupied a large space in the procession of
events i-n the last year. Her resources and the genius of her
people have been before the world's eye at St. Louis, with results
as honorable as they are satisfactory. California has made her
biggest bow to the world and put her shining lure where it has
clfarmed. millions. Awakened to a fuller knowledge of her power,
4atent in the mo*t varied and valuable capacities enjoyed by any
part- of the world's surface, she is girded for the most important
year's work in her history. With the implements of industry in
the hand 91- enterprise, her people go forth to the woodsand waters,
the fields and vineyards, the orchards and mines, to conquer com
fort and wealth from that embarrassment of riches which nature
has lavished upon her in a setting of scenery and sunshine unsur
passed.
Knowing that much is required of those to whom much is
given. Californians. alive to their duty and their opportunity, will
make the vorld their debtor in the year to come. Let them to-day
remember the disinherited among them, and be liberal to those in
need. .Let them help the brother that has stumbled, that, set upon
his feÂ«?t. he may run the race appointed, and out of their abundance
let mercy and charity give with a free hand.
IX some of its aspects the Folsom break is not a pleasant subject
to discuss. But in others it is to be viewed with unmixed satis
faction. The incidents of the former break, in which the Warden
and guards were held prisoners and used as shields for the escap
ing convicts, were an injury to prison discipline everywhere. It
imperiled the safety of society by pointing out to bad prisoners a
way of escape to a freedom that would be used in preying upon
others. Xo wonder its example was followed in the same prison
where it was set.
The bravery of Captain Murphy and Guard Jolly, in taking the
fire of thc.ir fellows and retaining a presence of mind which faci'i
tated the. Shooting down of the conspirators, is beyond all praise.
They suffer for the good of the State and the State should not
forget them. Warden Veil ha< proved himself the man for the hard
place he fills. His orders to the guards to fire, even though con
victs might be using his own body for a shield, were obeyed, and
his part in the brief battle was that of a man of soldierly spirit and
courage. He ranks now with the foremost wardens who have the
management of convicts in charge.
His foresight has saved a wholesale break, for it is sure that
if the ringleaders had succeeded they would hay* been joined
by scores of. others in leaving the prison. Had this occurred we
would now be witnessing a repetition of the sickening incidents that
followed the escapes effected under Warden Wilkinson. Prison dis
cipline everywhere is restored and society is safer than before.
And for this all honor is due to Warden Yell and his brave officers.
THE WOMEN NEWSMAKERS.
THE closing months of the year have brought our sister woman
forward as a news center. The press of the country has surren
dered the front page to her. Mrs. Chadwick, the financial won
der of the youthful century, has come forward as the champion bam
boozler of bankers, preachers and social circles. She has sent all male
operators in shady finance so far to the rear that their operations
look like thirty cents.
In boldness, plausibility and grandeur of scheme she is easily
first. If Andrew Carnegiews judgment prove good and she get a
term in prison, she will still remain the greatest criminal curio the
world has known. Broken banks and indicted bankers strew her
path. She and Nan Patterson have held the front of the stage, and
wars and rumors of wars, parliaments and congresses, even the riots
in the Hungarian Diet, get no more attention than common dog
fights.
A close second to them is the lady voter of Colorado, who seems

THE SAX FRAN-CISCO CALL. SUNDAY. JANUARY 1. 1905
FEW PERSONS ARE FITTED
TO ENTER THE INNOCENT
HEART OF A TOUNG GIRL
BY DOROTHY FENIMORE.
IN Helen Keller'* story of her life is
narrated the pathetic incident of the
rojne girl awakening to the mean-
ing of the word ''love." Is it the
sweetness of the flowers? she asked.
N**. said her teacher, it is not that. Is
he warm sun* sh* questioned. No
it is not exactir that, was the reply.
At last In her own way she tiesped
what love is, and in her own way she
defined itâit is something yon cannot
touchâ"but you can feel the sweetness
that It pours into everything. Without
love you would not be happy, or want j
tc play. The beautiful truth burst \
upon my mind." she says. "I felt that
there were invisible lines stretched be- !
tween my spirit and the spirit of I
01 hers."
An emotional experience similar to,
Helen Keller's is not unusual with nor
mal gir?bood. except that, where ave
nuÂ«s of s*ns* are not cut off. knowl
edge of love comes spontaneously, un
bidden. The mood itself is. I should
say. characteristic of young woman
hood, at its earliest-dawn, among girJs
who have groin n as the flowers do
which are well nourished by fr-Â»sb air
end sun.
to have fought cussed and cheated at the polls and stuffed the
ballot-box with as free a hand as ever did her brother, man. She is
also in jail for these offenses. But it must be a hard-hearted tyrant
who condemns her to any very severe punishment. She has done
no more and mighty little less for her favorite candidate or her party
than the male electors of that perturbed State have done. If each
criminal ballot cast in the last election in Colorado had been emetic
in its effect the ballots would have been spilled all over the moun
tains and the plains and the mining gulches.
As newsmakers the representatives of the gentler sex have
earned the gratitude of the news editors who were bored numb by the
passive stupidity and dullness of the Presidential campaign.
VARDAMAN AND THE LAW.
GIVE Governor Vardaman his due. His turbulent career
and violent expressions prior to his election as Governor of
Mississippi inspired the rough spirits of that State with the
belief that he would wink at the murderous extermination of the
negroes. It must be said in behalf of tjie exterminators that they
were somewhat justified in this. But they are now placed in the
position of all criminals who have misunderstood a wink from the
governing power. They proceeded to organize murder bees, and to
amuse themselves by harry ing and torturing negroes. Their white
cap clubs had great fun for a while, and as the game was plenty the
hunt went on. Then Vardaman acquired respect for the law and
proceeded to hunt the hunters. For this purpose he employed Pink
ertons to go into the white cap counties and secure evidence which
he has used in court to such good purpose that a large number of
white men are in the penitentiary, some for life, some for fifty
years and others for less but long terms, and some stand a chance
to look their last through a noose.
Vardaman is a surprise to the North, but he is a painful revel
ation to the white cap counties of his own State. He has been so
brusque and violent in his utterances that it is a real pleasure to
offset them by his acts. He has shown relentless energy in pursu
ing those who torture, rob and murder negroes as a pastime in his
State, and should have full credit for it. He also sets an example
to all Governors in whose States there k the disease of the mob
spirit and of mob law. Others may profit by his example, by the
employment of Pinkertons to get evidence that will convict these
enemies of order. In several Northern States the spectacle of a
few leading citizens in stripes will have a wholesome and deterrent
effect upon the sessions of the court of Judge Lynch.
SOME HOLIDAY EDITIONS.
NEWSPAPERS in Alameda County have signalized the holiday
season by expending their best efforts upon extra editions
typifying the march of progress and setting forth the triumphs
of industry which have marked the year just passed.
Especially worthy of commendation is the excellent Christmas
edition of forty-eight pages which the Oakland Tribune has brought
out. Besides giving in detail the signs of prosperity which mark
the present growth of Oakland and its suburbs, the Tribune im
partially extends its survey to the whole of Alameda County and
gives its neighbor, Contra Costa, a goodly share of space. Art
work of a high class' and halftones, in the main excellently repro
duced, make the Tribune's edition a notable piece of newspaper
production.
That bright little sheet, the Alameda Argus, is not behindhand
in enterprise. Its Christmas edition, well written and amply illus
trated, gives a good boost to the island city. From the college
town came the enlarged edition of the Berkeley Gazette, a credit
able publication compiled to emphasize the spirit of the holidays,
while at Niles the Washington Press and at Elmhurst the Review
emulated with success the example of their urban contemporaries
with colored supplements of ample proportions: so that Alameda
County obtained a series of Christmas compliments upon which her
people may well congratulate themselves.
The Marie Bashkirtseffs and the
Mary MeLenes are. fortunately, aa
rare as they are unhappy. Until a
young girl falls in lore with some par
ticular individual her heart is naturally
passionless, tbough it thrills in sympa
thy with the joys and sorrows of
the world about it, or flatters, birdlike,
with a consciousness of winged power.
ln a-1 of nature there is no other
sanctuary into which so few pecpie
â¢re fitted to enter as the Jnnocent heart
of a yojng girL It is a white place,
fair and pure. Within it reigns a rev
erence that is mingled faith and fear.
'Tia like a cloistered garden, warmed
with sunshine, but overhung with a
solemnity of soft shadows and a quiet
spirit of prayer.
Yet I doubt if there H any young
man who does not feel himself qualified
at least to lay flower* on the altar
there and to w-jrship. either as a publi
can or a Pharisee. So great is the ar
rogance of manâor. maybe, so wise is
his inspiration.
It must certainly be to such relative
conditions as these between maids and
men that Oliver Wendell Holmes re
fers when h*- declares that it is a terri
ble fact when a young girl, wjth the
blood and nerve fiber that belongs to
nature's women, is turned loose among
men. It is very terrible, he asserts.
There is nothing more so. "If jealousies
that gnaw men's hearts cut of their
bodiesâif pangs that wtste men to
shadows and drtve them into madness
or moping me!ancho!> : :f assassination
and suicide are dreadful possibilities,
then there is always something fright
ful about a lovely young woman.'
But the secret of this dread fascina
tion, as he divines it, is a high, a noble
thing. It is not love, though love may
be a part of it. It is not necessarily
beauty, though beauty lends to it an
added charm. It is that strange mys
tery which one sees in certain women's
facesâsome of them real and some of
them Idealâwhich seem to give a hint
of the great secret"' which, were it
known, wouid explain the universe. So
direct and intimate a revelation does
it appear to be of infinite purity and
love.
ThÂ«*re are. this philosopher admits,
hosts of women whose faces have no
secret to tell beyond that one encom
passed by the three words. T love
yon." They, he says humorously, are
like firecrackers on the morning of the
sth of July, and exactly as that small
patriotic implement is made with a
slender train that leads to the maga
zine that is within it. so a sharp eye
can nearly always discern the train
leading from a young girls eye or lip
to the "I love you" in her heart.
But the three words are not of them
selves the great secret, though, as I
said above, they may form part of It.
Perhapsâ at any rat* 1 I like to think it
trueâHelen Keller found the definition
at which Holmes tailed, by bis own
confession, when ahe put Into words
for us her own Idea of love.
PRESIDENT NEVER
GETS TIRED.
IT is aafe to cay that Mr. Roosevelt
is the busiest and the happiest man
in the country. He is as strong as
a horse and as eager for work a?
a youngster who has Just taken his
first jr>b and is earning bis first sal
ary. The President said to a friend
the other day that he never knew what
It mas to ret tired. He has learned to
economize hie time. He wastes much >

he has been made to realize that his
time is valuable and that he must con-

now almost rivals Mr. McKlnley in
that respect.

A Story illustrative of the President's

White House. The President s guest
of honor vas .Sir Martin OMmf of
England, the well-known mountain
-limber and traveler. Sir Martin was
delighted to disc-over that Mr. Roose
velt knew almost as much about moun
ta'n climbing as he did. Then the con
versation took another turn, and for an
hour the jthei guests were virtually
left to themsel\es while the Pr*Â«ident
and the Englishman engaged in a most
animated and prolonged conversation.
It eventually turned out that Sir
Martin, in addition to being a moun
tain clfmbÂ»r. is an inveterate oriental
ist and is veil up as to the ancient
dynasties of the kingdoms which cen
tered about the head of the Mediter

THE SHERIFF'S POSSE
BY FRflflK H. SVEET.
SELS5 ELS PESSNER moved haltingly
along the face or the cliff,
crouching almost to the rock to
obtain the slight concealment
afforded by a few stunted
bushes, untii he arrived at a sharp
bend, where he rose cautiously to his
feet and gave a quick glance down into
the valley and back over the way he
had come.
It was a wild, rocky way. ending in
this long climb up the face of the
mountain: but his stance flashed over
it In a swift, comprehensive scrutiny.
All was desolation, solitude, save at the
base of the very slope up which he was
struggling, where a compact group of
men were following his trail, as surely
and unrelentingly as bloodhounds.
Even as his glance flashed down at
them there came the returning flash o.
sunlight on a leveled rifle barrel into
his ryes. and he ducked and supped
around the bend. As he did so a bul
let flattened against the rock behind
where his head had been.
Steve Finter." he thought grim.y.
"No other man can shoot like that. He
must have seen my head up. If only I
can get up to mv cabin I won't mind.
I can pick off Steve from there, and
maybe some of the others before they
close In. Iâl hope Luisita ain't to
home."
Weil up on the face of the opposite
mountain was Seis Pessner*s cabin.
Here he and Steve Finter had worked
together, in seeming harmony, until one

day Steve had slipped down to the
mining toy.a below and accused his
partner of having robbed and attempt
ed to murder him. and of being a horse
thief, and contemplating other bold
robberies in the neighborhood. He had
so ingratiated himself with the Sheriff
as to be scorn in as a deputy to aid in
the capture.
The first intimation Sels had had of
the accusation was seeing the Sheriff's
posse approach the cabin, and almost
at the same moment he received a bul
let in his shoulder. Other bullets had
followed, but in some way he had es
caped. He had eluded his pursuers and
hurried to the mining town, slipping in
at night and conferring with some of
his friends. The next day these men
had done a little quiet investigating for
him. while he remained in one of their
homes. That night, in spite of their
warnings and expostulations, he bad
started back, his face stem and his
eyes full of angry determination. But
when he saw the posse and threw up
his hands in token of surrender, with a
papÂ«* held conspicuously in one hand,
a bullet frc-m Steve's rifle found lodg
ment in his ankle, almost bringing him
to the ground.
After that he skulked and dodged
and climbed for hours, using a piece of
broken limb in place of the ankle that
was almost useless, suffering agony
at every step, and with only the hope
of reaching his cabin and making the
last stand as retaliatory as possible.
Now, as be crossed into the small val
ley he tried to keep within the screen
of foliage as much as he could. Luisita

A lean and empty pack.

Across the froxen snow.
A youth came striding into view.
His smooth young cheeks aglow.
His shoulders bore a bulging sack.

Since returning from abroad other

idea in its many opposing phases. It
was from a mind thoroughly saturated
with the subject that the great iron

his remarkable prophecy as to the fu

Europe.
In retiring from active business lifeâ

THE SAN" FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 1. 1905.
James Kitson there is an unbridge
able difference of opinion in many
matters of international import.
"Sir James Kitson as a member of
Parliament and a leader of industrial
England is not to be considered lightly
when he expresses his opinion." began
Mr. Carnegie. He was smiling. His
voice, of low register, was as velvety
as the paw of a purring cat. Suddenly
the shadow of a claw was reflected in
his words. He continued:
"We who work in anc\ for peace are
sorry that our pugilistic friend, Sir
James, has such doubts as to the effi
cacy of The Hague tribunal. But there
is some consolation in the fact that his
opinion is not shared by some of his
distinguished countrymen."
Pausing long e.iugh to touch a bell
on his desk the speaker soon had ir. his
hand a current magazine, in which Sir
Robert Finlay, member of Parliament
and Attorney General for Great Brit
ln, discussed the subject at hand.
"For instance." continued Mr. Carne
gie, as he rapidly searched the pages,
"this somewhat remarkable article by
the British Attorney General has just
come to my notice to-day. Contrary to
Sir James, the learned parliamentarian
here gives his unqualified indorsement
to international arbitration as the saf
est, sanest and most desirable remedy
for war.
"Since Sir James rendered his ver
dict in the case of peace versus war,
international arbitration has again
been resorted to as a means of settling
the difficulty arising out of the attack
of the Russian Baltic fleet upon the
English trawling vessels. We have
visible evidence of the greatest mari
time power in the world and the great
est landed empire on earth having re
course to our useless and superfluous
organization at The Hague.
"Certain critics of the Peace Con
gress have defined a nation as an indi
vidual many times multiplied. On the
surface this is so," admitted Mr. Car
negie. "Underneath let us hope that
it is false. Why? The time is not so
long past since every able-bodied man
went armed, just as did every tribe. It
is not so very long since warâfighting
âwas the ordinary occupation of
tribes and men. Indeed, even con
temporary history tells us of instances
where warfare is or was the only oc
cupation worthy of gentlemen. Only
into a purer and more enjtoyable at
mosphere. Your lmagina%on will
work in different and more useful and
more legitimate channels; it will be
v mental, moral and a life tonic. Try
it; do so at once. Green-goggled peo
ple are very unhappy people. They
are an abnormal specimen of human
ity. Why fret and worry over what
others think or say of you as long as
it is not true and does not affect your
character, which, of course, should be
unimpeachable and jealously guard
ed? We all have to give an account
of our life. Be sure that you are in
the right place, then go ahead; do
right, live right, swerve neither to the
right nor left, no matter what others
may say or think of you. Your purest
motives may be misconstrued, your
best endeavors misinterpreted and
your honest life decried, but what of
that? Were not the best of men that
ever lived treated in like manner?
Did not the greatest reformers fare
likewise? Is it not the experience of
all men in the path of right?
Some men are born into this life
cross-grained, and their judgment, as '
probably did in many instances, where
her purpose was to obtain the money
to repay the money Just borrowed.
But all the time the amount of her
loans was mounting higher and higher
until finally she became so deeply in
volved that her resources were no
longer able to tide her over the diffi
culties which have landed her in a
prison cell.
By one who has as good reason for
making a correct estimate of the ex
tent of the woman's transactions as
anybody else except Mrs. Chadwick
herself and two or three of those who
for obvious reasons would have noth
ing to say on the subject, it Ib be
lieved that about three millions is the
amount she has been able to borrow
during the last few years. She has
actually repaid two-thirds of this
amount, leaving about one million or
less to be accounted for by her per
sonal expenditures and in other direc
tions and still owed by her.
That she has no money left, how
ever, Is by no means likely. She could
not retain the lawyers who have been
devoting so much time to her affairs
lately unless she were able to pay
them well, and when there has even
lately arisen an occasion where it was
women were champions of peace.
"But within recent years war has
ben steadily discountenanced. For
merly even the good St. Francis of
Assisi was one of those who went
forth to war the men of
Perugia. Up to the time of Napoleon
there were 132 individual nations,
each capable of declaring and prose
cuting a war. Napoleon consolidated
131 of them.

peace unless you let them have their
own way and never cross their path.
They remind me of little rat-terrier
dogs, who will run after passers-by
and nag them. Nagging at some one
or something is their delight. So let
them have their cross-grainedness and
don't fret about it, for you didn't bring
them into this world and you are not
responsible for what they say and do.
Tulmage once said: "Blue Monday
will breed other blue Mondays.'*
Worry is very prolific of ev'ls. It
is worry that kills prematurely multi
tudes of mankind. Worry is irksome
and compels to excessive bodily exer
tions and mental labor, which often
lead to insanity and self-destruction.
Worry begets selfishness, greed and
' contentions. Worry impels to intern
absolutely necessary to provide funds
for current expenses they have been
forthcoming.
When she paid the driver of the
carriage which took her from the
Hotel BreaJJn, in New York, to the
postofnce building on the morning
after her arrest, for instance, she pro
duced a roll of bills which must have
meant the possession of several hun
dred dollars at least, unless all the
bills were of very small denomina
tions. She had plenty of money to
pay for meals sent to her while in
the Tombs and in the Cleveland Jail.
Her son, Emil, has apparently not
been cramped for money to pay for
his trips between New York and
Cleveland.
The retaining of one of the leadln"
criminal lawyers of Ohio to defend
her and the associating with him of
two other attorneys of prc.ninence Is
still better evidence that she is far
from poverty stricken.
At the same time none of the men
who are devoting their best efforts
toward locating whatever she may
have are able to get a reply which is
at all satisfactory to the question they
are so anxious to have answered.
Neither of the receivers who have
the European p< wers do you mean
that the same idea aa exemplified by
commercial and Industrial combina
tions is to be carried into govern
ment ?"
"Perhaps the industrial work is sow
ing and growing the seed," he replied.
"But whether one is to be the essen
tial outgrowth of the other is yet to
be proved."
"Do you consider then that the
unification principle is the most vital
message of the present age, Mr. Car
negie?"
"I consider âI firmly believe," was
the emphatic answer, "that by the year
3000, and probably long before, the
nineteenth century, tremendous as its
record of achievement and advance
ment has been, will be most distin
guished and applauded as having given
the world for the first time a perma
nent tribunal as a means of settling
international disputes. That is to be
our greatest gift to mankind âa gift
for which posterity will render praise."
"When. In your opinion, will war
cease to be a peril?"
"Again It would be hazardous to ven
ture a prediction," he replied. "But
this war between Russia and Japan is
opening the eyes of the world to the
perance, drunkenness and gambling.
Worry frequently leads on to dishon
est ways and means to secure a live
lihood. It often interferes with other
men's personal rights and liberties.
Worry now and then causes men to
abandon home and domestic duties and !
leave those dependent on them by the
tie of nature to the mercilessness of a
cold, unsympathetic world.
Worry began with our first parents
in Eden and to-day no class of people
escapes the disposition to worry. The
rich man is afraid for his life. At
night he dreams of the bloodythirsty
hand of anarchism. The rulers and
offlt ers of the land are not exempt. The
hand of the assassin is suspended. The
learned worry because the world does
not recognise and appreciate their
superior ability and services to the ex
tent they anticipated. The poverty
stricken worry because they do not
possess as much of this world aa they
think they should have for their own
comfort. The illiterafi who desire to
do good worry because of their ignor
ance or inability to fill positions in life
where their influence and activity
1 might be felt, recognized and appre-
been named by creditors apparently
has the slightest information as to
what has become of the trunks she
took with her to New York and which
were last heard of at the Holland
House. A deputy sheriff who served
an attachment on the hotel manage
ment and on the woman herself never
was able to obtain any satisfaction as
to their whereabouts.
Where Mrs. Chadwlck's jewels are is
another question that has not yet been
answered. They are supposed to be in
Cleveland, but there is little more rea
son for thinking that they are here
than in a safety deposit in New York
or some other city. In fact nobody ex
cept Mrs. Chadwick and some trusted
friends of hers knows anything about
them.
"I have no jewels; the talk about
them is nonsense," the woman says.
But there are many persons who do
not believe her. Others, on the con
trary, are inclined to think that she
may be telling; the truth and that the
necklaces and valuable pins and
brooches she is known to have bought
have been hypothecated as security for
loans. Henry Worts of Elyrla has |85,
-000 worth of them as security for a loan
ex $36 t OOO, and other men have jewelry
need and possibilities of arbitration.
Every month we see new treaties signed
between nations. They are the tributes
that war pays to peaceâvice to virtue.
If our belligerent friends across the wa
ter do not raise an insurmountable bar
rier we hope within a very short time
to exchange treaty courtesies with
England."
Continuing, Mr. Carnegie declared
that the next best step to insure inter
national peace was to extend the triple
and dual alliance idea.
"This," he pursued, "may be made
possible by some great captain of
peace. I will not say much as lam
gratified by his present reported atti
tude in the premises, that President
Roosevelt will be Instrumental in for
warding the Issue by which swords
will no longer be drawn by nation
against nation. But when the hour Is
ripe the man will surely appear."
"In view of this expressed attftude
in fostering The Hague Congress, were
you not surprised that the Czar did not
propose arbitration with Japan before
engaging war?*" was suggested.
Arising: to his feet and pacing- several
times across the room. It was nearly a
minute before he answered:
"While there Is life there Is hope.
The Manchurlan campaign Is not end
ed yet. This war has cast a profound
shadow upon all loving people.
We In this coun' ff are over-Inclined
to criticize the Russians. Do we for
get that Japan attacked Port Arthur
before war was declared? Do let us
be just to Russia"
"Do you expect Russia to be victori
ous in the end?"
"Yes," emphatically, "I believe Rus
sia has right on her side, having been
attacked before she had an opportuni
ty to arbitrate. I believe that Japan
will be driven back to her island
home."
"It has been said by an authority on
the situation, Mr. Carnegie, that in
case Japan wins she will move next
toward the Philippines as an outlet for
for her surplus population. Have you
considered such a possibility?"
Sharply and with keen Incision the
millionaire philanthropist replied by
agreeing with Secretary Root, in his
speech nominating Roosevelt, that the
United States should help the Philip
pines to establish a stable, independent
government, and should not stir an
| dated. The farmer worries on account
of a shortage in his crops. The busl
| ness man v. orries because his sales are
not aufficient to rapidly accumulate
wealth. The day laborer worries about
j how he shall make provision for his
j family in the anticipation of his death.
The lawyer worries over his client's
complicated case, which, if he can clear
him, wins for him a fat slice of his
client's gold. And even the preacher,
whom the public rightly expects to
worry less than any other class of his
fellow beings, in spite of himself and
his profession, worries on account of
the superabundance of dead and use
less material in the church and of the
little success in spite of his best ef
forts in building up the work.
Thomas Beecher, some years ago, in
a lecture related concerning his
brother, the great Henry Ward
Beecher: "I went to hear my brother
preach one Sabbath morning, and
Henry invited me to dine with him.
As we were walking leisurely toward
his home, I said to him, 'Henry, there
was not very much thought in your
sermon this morning." He playfully
replied, 'That is the reason I screamed
of lesser value on which she borrowed
money from them.
But even though Mrs. Chadwick prob
ably had to divide much of the money
she obtained, and though a consider
able part of her loans is represented by
bonuses, some paid and others which
she still owes, she must have spent at
least several hundred thousand dollars
during the last few years while she has
been astonishing those who knew her
personally or by reputation because of
her reckless extravagance. Whatever
she has seen that she liked she seems
to have bought.
Though she has two Panhard auto
mobiles, her livery bills have run into
thousands. Wherever she has done
business she has tipped liberally every
body with whom she has come in con
tact, and it was indeed a fortunate
clerk to whom she took a fancy. In
each store where she made purchases
there was some single man or woman
whom she insisted on having wait on
her, and her tips in that direction,
while representing only an infinitesimal
part of her expenditures, were consid
erable ln themselves.
In the furnishings of her home, in
Cleveland, she rpen. probably $200,000,
but from this amount, In making an %*
Inch from the islands until such a gov
ernment is established.
Before dismissing the Philippine
question the speaker launched a broad
side at Judge Taft, aa regarded his
advice concerning the best course to
pursue with the Philippines, by say
ing: "The ostrich at least hides hia
head in the sand, but Judge Taft does
not even have the courtesy to do that.
Our duty is to say squarely what ws
will do and to become the founderâ tha
motherâof the first republio in tha
Orient."
"You consider the Philippine prob
lem aa one of the most vital issues of
the campaign, then?"
"Most emphatically! We must stay
on the islands only long enough to set
the Filipino feet in the right path. Oth
erwise we are bound to run amuck.
Having a pretty clear knowledge of
European opinion, It is my candid be
lief that we would be deplorably unjust
to pursue any other course."
"Then yon are opposed to expan
sion?"
"No, air. Far from It. f belters tha*
every island within hailing distance of
American shores should fly the Stars
and Stripes and look to Washington as
Its source of government and protection.
I hold that it will be Just as unnatural
for even Canada and the United States
to remain divided as It would have
been for Scotland and England to re
main apart, in so far as British wel
fare Is concerned."
"When do you think the time will
come for a Canadian accession?"
"We are getting closer together
every day," earnestly. "Every time an
American crosses the border and es
tablishes a home in the Canadian
Northwest, and every time a Canadian
casts his fortunes among us, a link is
added* in the chain which sooner or
later is sure to bind the two countries
in one. I myself would be delighted to
see all tariff barriers broken down be
tween Canada and the United States.
We over here must and, in my opinion,
will all be one, Just as the nations of
Europe will eventually be nractically
one. What will be the advantage?
Simply this: It will guarantee the
peace of the North American continent
and the peace of this hemisphere is to
us worth more than all the millions of
dollars revenue that we might gain by
tariff and trading."
so. But, Thomas, I have Just as good
a right to preach a poor sermon as
any other man In this world.' "
So let us do our best and not worry
over the results. Worry disqualifies
us to do our best In life's calling. It
will enwrap us in gloom, a mental mist
gathers and threatening storm clouds
begin to form in the horizon of ths
mind. Our Intellectual powers are in a
sense paralysed, we are not at our best
and cannot under those circumstances
do our best. Then this worry will be
come contagious. Others will be in
fected by it. Be around a gloomy and
despondent person awhile and yon will
become melancholy, too. To worry is
wrong to yourself and toward yoor fel
low men. It is unbecoming the dignity
of human nature, calling and destiny.
Some one may ask "What is the rem
edy, how may I get rid of worry V
Answer: Think less of yourself, less
of what others may think of you, less
of your own little, often Imaginary
troubles. Have confidence in your
ability, trust in God with all your
heart, lead an honest and a pure life
and go ahead in the path of duty until
you are called up higher.
timate of her expenditures, must be de
ducted the money she borrowed by giv
ing a mortgage on these personal be
longings, thus giving her back a part of
the money that found its way from her
in this direction.
The same thing is true of many of
her purchases of diamonds and other
precious stones. While she has been
known to buy diamonds by the dozens
and valuable pins by the tray, she was
very likely to hypothecate them, and
thus get back part of the purchase
money, after she had an opportunity
to dazzle her acquaintances by the
magnificence of her adornments or had
added this seemingly convincing argu
ment to her words to induce bankers to
loan her money on the strength of her
supposedly great wealth.
"What did she do with it?" may
never be answered in detail. It cer
tainly will remain mysterious to a
considerable extent until she is brought
to trial, when the replies to this ques
tion will be one of the most interesting
parts of the testimony. Even then the
answer will probably leave a vagueness
which only those who have profited by
their dealings with her could clear up,
and they will forever do their utmost to
leave the whole matter te â¢Raculetlen.

CHINESE FIND
A NEW SCHEME
American Born Mongolians
Marry Women and Bring
Them Here as Slaves
WASHINGTON ALAE3IED
Bureau Officials Investigate
and One of the Wives Makes
Confession of Conspiracy
Six Chinese women believed to be
slaves and imported to this city for
immoral purposes are held prisoners in
the detention shed at. the Mall dock
pending investigation by the Chinese
Bureau officials. One of the women
confessed yesterday. AH are claimed
as wives of American born Chinese.
The authorities at Washington have
learned that a conspiracy has been
formed by a large number of Chinese-
Americans to import slave women to
this city for the purposes of specula
tion, and the evidence now In posses
sion of the Department of Commerce
and Labor tends to show that such is
the fact.
The last arrival. J>e Sing, brought
j with him on the China his wife and
! they were accompanied by three other
t Chinese men and their wives. The men
had court records and all other neces
sary papers, showing that they were
nativv Americans. They also produced
marriagp certificates, the ceremony
having been performed in Canton,
Thina, by an English clergyman ln the
presence of witnesses. As the wives of
Americans are also American citizens
the women would have been landed
were it not for the confession of the j
one woman.
Two of the women were brought here
on the steamship Manchuria by Lee
Mcc, a Chinese-American. Lee Mcc has
a bad record. Three years ago he mar
ried Kun Vow in this city. Some time
subsequently he took a girl named
How- Wan to the Chinese mission on
Bush street and proposed marriage.
Miss Lake, the mipslon superintendent,
objected; her suspicions having been
aroused.

OAKLAND, Dec. 31.âThe man
agement of Ye Liberty Theater in this
city and the Majestic Theater in San
Francisco is to inaugurate a new sys
tem within a few weeks, which will
greatly improve the quality of the
plays produced at both houses. Two
companies will be formed, each of
which will present an exclusive line
of plays. One company will present
standard dramas and the other will
be devoted to the production of liatfu
comedy.
One of these companies will present
a play at Ye Liberty Theater one
week and the following week the
company, scenery and properties will
be changed to the Majestic Theater
in San Francisco, where the same play
will be presented with the same stage
setting, -Aile the other company will
| come to Â»?akland. This will giyp each
I company two weeks' work in the same
; Play.
j One company will be headed by
Landers Stevens and the other will be
headed by Robert Elliott and J. H

posed of members of Ye Liberty and
Majestic troupes, recruited with new
I people.
j 'The Prisoner of Zenda." which

Bendixen Sues on Contract.
A suit for the recovery of $17,064 56
on a contract in which the money in
volved is expressed in the German
mark, worth 24 cents in American
coin, was tiled yesterday by Georg L
J. BeAdtxen against Frlednch Rather
The action grows out of the agree
ment In October. 1894, between Ru
ther and C. Ed Bendixen for the dis
solution of their copartnership. It is
said that Ruther agreed to collect all
the money due and pay all the debts
excepting 107.205.7 marks owing to
Georg Bendixen. On this he was to
pay interest at 4 per cent and en
deavor to reduce the principal to 100 -
000 marks before 1900 and thereafter
pay 10,000 marks a year until the debt
was discharged. The interest has not
been paid and the 40,000 marks on
the principal has not been forthcom
ing far the last four years.

â  We beat 1903 after all in these clearings,
Kft It.was only at tha very close of the year,
and then by a very small margin. However, It
is gratifying to that the volume of busi
ness in 1904 v as indicated by these clearings,
was. better than in 1903. as the latter was a
.fine year.

Wall-Street Tip*.
" The New York wires of E. F. Hutton ft
. Co. yesterday said:
STOCKS.âAlthough the decline In the mar
'â ket lÂ£ a damper dn sentiment it is looked upon
by capable critics as a natural reaction due
to the usual evening up of contracts Incident
â  to the end of the year and pending holidays.
.These observers have therefore decided that
â¢ around. present prices stocks are a purchase.
''Reports that Lawson will issue another
rnanlfesto in the advertising columns of the
morning papers." said the head of a prom
inent bouse to-night, "hava been used against
the market, but I notice that they have not
affected .standard shares very much. If the
.Boston operator makes another attack I be
lieve that Instead of the expected scare there
will be good buying and a consequent ad
vance." Tha indications are that a very large
part of the final selling In Copper, Steels.
Union Pacific and other stocks active in the
â¢last "hour yesterday were by followers of Law
.son',, so .that the short interest has been con
siderably increased.
. Lawson is going to screech next Tuesday.
However, this man's talk has lost the bulk
â¢of. its force. He is ready to howl when the
. market goes up fifteen points, but reactions
.now-will, be only slight from present figures.
The Financial Bureau says: There will be
further operations on account of Lawson ru
mors, but we expect support to be extended
ajrainst the raids.
No Liverpool or New York cotton market
to-day.
Coal. Iron and Oil.
' The annuar"circular of J. W. Harrison says:
. "The total amount of ooal imported Into Cali
fornia this year. 1.051.072 tons being 164,482
tons less than last year, would Intimate that
our manufacturing interests are declining,
when the quantity of coal fuel Is diminishing,
but sneh Is not the case. For example, the
output of oil for the year will foot up nearly
ten million barrels in excess of 1903. the major
portion of which has been used by railway
companies and industrial interests, showing by
actual computation that our local manufactur
ers have largely increased their buaineos and
a great many new Industries are being intro
duced, being encouraged to do so by the low
prices of fuel oil. At the beginning of this
year -{January 15) the duty of 670 per ton on
foreign coai was replaced.
"With fuel oil as a competitor and the pres
ent reduced values set on same coal has to
be sold at comparatively low figures when used
for steam purposes; when utilized for domestlo
purposes a fair, value is set upon It, as oil
ceases to compete as a house fuel until the
principal obstacles are overcome, viz: the
ellmlnaUon of smell and smoke and the In
crease of danger. There has been a pro
nounced decrease of Australian coal Imports
this year, caused mainly by coal carriers be
ing unable to find profitable employment on
an 1 val here, and present conditions are now
â¢compelling a large number of vessels to return
.to the- colonies In ballast. This r.aturaliy
forces shippers to pay generous freight rates
on-coai from Newcastle, N. S. W., and causes
a marked shrinkage of amount delivered. Rul.
lag prices have been very uniform during the
year and consumers cannot complain of pay
ing extreme rates, as the profits are very
meager when the cost of handling same is con
sidered. â 
. "The various sources from which we have
derived our coal supplies are as follows:
1903, 1904.

The total amount received by water at those

'Fuel OilâThe oil products for MO4 will
Â»ggregate fully 50.000.000 barrels, asainat
Â£1,000,000 for 1903 and 13.000,000 for 1902 This
immense Increase shows the present status of
our Stats, for oil as a fuel producer and It*
standing as a formidable competitor to coal
locally. About three m'llloas Of barrels have
been used for illuminating; lubricating Â«t>
and about 500,000 barrels of crude o)J roads'
i*jÂ»out ten million barrels are now In
lielng held in reserve, evidencing that our
future requirements are generally provided for
The present condition of the fuel situation for
the demands of our factories Is a most gratU
tying one and promises generous profits for the
coming year, as the asking prices for oil are
most favorable, with every likelihood of a sus
tenance of present values.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Dec. 31. âA moderate buls* in
wheat prices occurred at the opening. The
cause was a fairly good commission house de
mand. May was %@%c to %c higher at
$1 13% to $1 14. The buying was partly the |
result of oontlnued light receipts in the North
west, arrivals to-day being almost half what
they were a year ago. After May had ad
vanced to $1 14% a quick reaction occurred
on realizing by pit traders, the price declin
ing to $1 13%. On the break, however, the
market met with good support from a leader
of the bulla. A quick â  recovery followed.
Prices wore given a decided upward impetus 1
by news from the Northwest, where the cash
markets showed unusual strength. The close
was at $1 14%.
Liquidation of December option was the
feature of the trading in the corn market.
May closed %o%c higher at 45%045%c.
Strength or' wheat had a steadying influence
on the oats market. May closed unchanged
at :Â»lVÂ»'*j3l%c.
Provisions were a trifle easier early In tha
day in sympathy with a small decline in the
price of hogs. May pork was up 2%0-Oc,
lard was up 2%<\ and ribs unchanged.

WHEATâThere was very little new. either
here or in the East, as usual on the cloalna
day of the year. Chicago was %c higher on ,
the day. The local market was neglected, as I
the session period was given up to the usual \
New Year's frolic of the brokers, who were ,
too occupied tn covering each other with Flour
and Bran and firing off bombs to pay any at
tention to trading.
There will be no session of the exchange to

and the'market generally had a weak tpne,
with sellers anxious to clean up. Offerings of
Feas. Beans and Tomatoes Included much poor
stock, which showed the effect of the rectnt

usual on Saturday, and there was continued
firmness in all descriptions, the market being
bare at the close. Receipts of dressed Turkeys
were very small, but the demand was likewise
and the market was not excited. Thirty-eight
cases came in and sold at about previous
prices. Good Game sold off well at steady
prices, while poor and thin stock, which was
abundant, dragged badly.

tinued dull and easy, though there was no very
heavy stock on hand, except In two or three

There was some little improvement in the
demand for Oranges, particularly the lower
grades of Navels, which were being bought
by peddlers, but supplies of all grades were
far In excess of the demand and the market
still had a weak tone. Mexican Limes were
firmly held at the recent advance, pending the
arrival of fresh supplies, but other Citrus
fruits were plentiful and dull. Persimmons
were in limited supply and prices were largely
nominal, and there was very little doing In

PORTO RICANS '
GIVEN ADVICE
Army Doctor Says Natives
Would Be Healthy if They
Obeyed Laws of Sanitation
NEW YORK, Dec. 31.âA letter from
Major L. L. Seaman, who has privately
been investigating conditions among
the inhabitants of Porto Rico, states
that the death rate there and the anae
mic condition of the rural poulation
are due to the so-called hookworm,
known to science as "ankylostoma
duodenale," which recently was stated
to be highly prevalent in the Southern
States and all tropical countries.
When fully developed the worm
sometimes attains a length of three
quarters ot an inch. Treatment of 5000
cases and exhaustive investigation by
a medical commission extending over
the year show, according to Major
Seaman, that the disease produced by
the worm has caused more than SO per
cent of the deaths in Porto Rico.
The parasite is really a blood sucker.
Its development requires about two
months, and its work in the intestines
has been found to greatly reduce the
red corpuscles of the blood vessels.
Some of the patients examined show
under microscopic tests only 25 per
cent of the normal amount of blood.
One man had only 13 per cent. The
blood boro a pinkish tint, almost as
light as water. At least 90 per cent
of the rural population of the island
is asserted to be affected by the rav
ages of the parasite, almost destroy
ing their energy. Three or four doses
of thymol or of beta-naphthol have
generally proved the most successful
treatment.
A successful campaign of sanitation,
teaching the rural population to use
the simplest sanitary methods in ev
ery-day life, would, Major Seaman de
clares, turn Porto Rico into a garden
spot and the majority of Its inhab
itants into a healthy, happy, red-blood
ed people. Unsanitary habits have
been inherited, he asserts, and the
present generation can scarcely be held
responsible. '

Bursting of a Water Main
Threatens Damage to Goth

DAM DIVERTS WATERS
Quick Work of a Pick and
Shovel Gang Prevents Eep
itition of Recent Disaster
NEW YORK, Pec. SI. âQuick work
by a gang of men with plcka and shov
els early to-day prevented a repetition
of the flood in the Subway which oc
curred two weeks ago through the
bursting of a water main. A thirty
six-inch pipe burst near One Hundred
and Forty-flfth street and Broadway
and threw a stream of water high in
the air. In a minute it was pouring
into the Subway station and a doaen
passengers made a timely escape on a
train, suffering only a slight wetting.
Men were hurried to the ecene and
succeeded in diverting the flood in an
other direction by building a dam. Cel
lars all about were flooded and the wa
ter reached a depth of eighteen inchea
in the street.
About the break the water boiled into
a foam aa it came from the gTound and
then took a course down grade on One
Hundred and Forty-seventh street
and thence to the Hudson River. Traf
fic along the Upper Broadway section
came to a stop. All along in the side
streets, between One Hundred and
Thirty-seventh and One Hundred and
Fortieth streets, houses on both sides
were soon flooded by the thousands of
tons of water. Tenants took alarm and
began to pack their belongings prep
aratory to moving ou\. Many thought
it would be unsafe to even remain in
their homes and started to leave only to
find that the water was too deep to
make wading safe. Not a cellar from
Broadway to the river was left dry.
Assistance was called from the water
department, but on the arrival of the>
workmen it was foi nd they had no key
large enough to shut the gates con
trolling the main and it was more than
an hour before the water finally
stopped Mowing. The entire water sup
ply of the city below Harlem and above
Thirty-fourth street will be affected.
The main which broke is one of the
two pressure service mains which sup
ply the entire section west of Broad
way.

CONTEST FOR DIVORCE
MUST BE TRIED AGAIN
Assistant Cashier Smith of Southern
Pacific Company Loses Appeal
to Supreme court.
Charles H. Smith, assistant cashier
of the Southern Pacific Company,
must appeal once more to the courts
if he wishes to be divorced from his
wife, Josephine. The Supreme Court
decided yesterday that Judge Mur
asky's order granting a new trial of
the case was valid. The case has been
in the courts for about four years and
meanwhile the railroad man has been
contributing $100 a month.
Smith began the suit on the ground
that he had been treated with extreme
cruelty. The contest attracted un
usual Interest because Mrs. Smith dis
pensed with the services of lawyers
and appeared in her own behalf. She
spent four days cross-examining her
husband, to the immeasurable delight
of those who wanted to learn the fam
ily's secrets.
One day she sent word to Judge
Daingerfleld that she was ill and could
rot appear. He refused to allow a
continuance and granted Smith a di
vorce. Mrs. Smith then engaged Judge
Cotton to manage the defense and he
secured an order granting a new trial.
Smith appealed to the Supreme Court.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, JANUARY 1, 1905.
BANK CLERKS OFFICIALLY
CLASSED AS LABORERS
Japanese Gentleman on Way to New
York Is Denied Landing on
That Ground.
Bank clerks are regarded by the
United States Immigration officials as
laborers, and under this ruling Kwa
nichi Miyamoto has been denied a land
ing at this port, and will be detained
pending the decision of the Department
of Commerce and Labor at Washing
ton. Miyamoto told United States Im
migrant Inspector D. J. Griffiths that
he was going to New York to take a
clerical position in the branch of the
Yokohama Specie Bank in that city at
a salary of $72 per month. The local
officials therefore regard him as a con
tract laborer, and will detain him here
pending orders from the department.
The precedent for this action was es
tablished in the case of Kenneth
Harper, a bank clerk, who came from
Canada to take a clerkship in the Brit
ish Bank of North America:- It was
then decided by the department that
imported bank clerks were contract la
borers, and Harper was accordingly
deported.

WANT TO PROVE
WILL A FORGERY
Contestants Demand Right
to Inspect Genuine Hand
writing of Samuel Davis
CODICIL IN QUESTION
It Is Said Comparison Will
Show Testament Waa Not
Signed by, Millionaire
Experts in handwriting will play a
prominent part in the pending contest
of the codicil to the will of Samuel
Davis, the eccentric millionaire who
died last April. A statement of the
contestants' purpose to use every
means toward the proof that the cod
icil was written and signed by other
than Davis is contained in a notice
and affidavit filed in the case yester
day by Attorney Carter P. Pomeroy,
representing Mary Q. Stone, niece of
the deceased, and the Mercantile Trust
Company, executor of the estate of
Henry W. Davis, who was a nephew
of the df-ad capitalist.
Pomeroy notities Executor Julius
Reis that on January 6, in Judge Ker
rigan's court, he will move for an
der compelling Rels to produce all of
the documents in his possession, in
Davis' handwriting, in order that they
may be photographed and submitted
to the inspection of the contestants'
expert witnesses and attorneys. It is
stated that a demand was made upon
Reis November 9 for an opportunity
to scrutinize the documents, but he
then refused and now refuses to dis
play them. Some of the documents
in question, it is said, were written and
signed by Davis on March 17, the date
of the alleged codicil, and the contest
ants frankly state that they will prove,
by a comparison of the genuine and
admitted writings, that the codicil was
neither written, signed nor dated by
Davis, but by some one else. The cod
icil Is written in pencil and is very
faint.
Davis' first will, dated February 21.
1898. which was admitted to probate
before the codicil was found, made no
disposition of the property worth more
than a million and a half of dollars,
but named Julius Reis as executor. Un
der it the estate would go to the heirs
at law, who were his sister. Jane
Davis, aged 87, his niece. Mary G.
Stone, and nephew, Henry W. Davis.
Recently both the sister and nephew
have died. The codicil materially dis
arranged this distribution, half of the
property being left to the sister, $130,
-000 disposed of in specific bequests and
the residue bequeathed to grand nieces
and grand nephews. The contestants
hope evidently lies In their ability to
prove that the codicil was a forgery.
BEAUTIFUL SERVICE
FOR A DEAD SISTER
Order of the Eastern Star Pays Trib-
ute to Memory of Mrs. Belle
W. Conrad.
The funeral service over the re
mains of the late Mrs. Belle Wingfleld
Conrad, who during her lifetime waa
deeply interested in fraternal associa-.
tidns, was held yesterday in part at
her former home. 408 Haight street,
and in part in the mortuary chapel
of the Odd Fellows' Cemetery. At the
home there was a meeting of sorrow
ing friends, with the opening of the
service of the Episcopal church, the
rendering of music by a quartet and
a eulogy by Past Grand President Mrs.
Mary E. Tillman of the Native Daugh
ters, after which the casket contain
ing the remains was removed from the
midst of magnificent floral offerings
contributed by friends and societies
by the following pallbearers: United
States Marshal J. H. Shine, Henry
Landerkin, J. McDonald, Arthur D.
Coddington, Angus McKay and Wil
liam Fa hey.
At the Odd Fellows' chapel the cere
mony was conducted by the Jtev. S. J.
Lee of the Episcopal Mission and the
officers of Golden Gate Chapter of the
Order of the Eastern Star, these offi
cers officiating at the request of tho
daughter of the deceased. The Knick
erbocker quartet rendered several se
lections.
Among- the many large floral pieces
was one from the Order of the East
ern Star representing the central star
in its Aye colors, a large representation
of the emblem of the Native Daugh
ters and a beautiful floral tablet from
Oabrlelle Parlor. N. D. G. W.
In the passing- away of Mrs. Con
rad the several orders to which she
belonged, particularly the Native
Daughters, nave lost a loyal worker
and a sincere fraternal member. She
was a member of Dardanelles Parloi
of Sonora, past grand president of the
Grand Parlor of the Native Daughters
of the Golden West, a past grand pro
tector of the Knights and Ladies of
Honor and a past worthy matron of
Tuolumne Star Chapter of the Order
of the Eastern Star. She was not only
a fraternal worker, but was a very
charitable woman and always ready t&
assist the needy, doing all such work
without ostentation and seeking no re
ward but the consciousness of having
aided people deserving of help.

CITIZEN GETS JUDGMENT
AGAINST PARK POLICEMAN
Officer Had No Right to Imprison
Castlehun for Walking on Path
Not Ordered Closed.
The evident good faith of Policeman
N. R. Norton in arresting F. J. Castle
hun on a summer Sunday two years
ago for attempting to leave Golden
Gate Park by a forbidden path served
to save the officer from a charge of
malicious arrest, but the fact that the
citizen had a right to travel the path
in Question made his imprisonment a
good ground for damages. In decidlng
Castlehun's suit yesterday Judge Sea
well found that he had been falsely
imprisoned and gave judgment against
Norton for $26. The money is not
much, but Castlehun is vindicated.
The facts in the case follow: Prior
to July 13. 1902, In order to save the
Sunday concert crowds from danger.
Sergeant Coogan instructed Policeman
N. R. Norton not to permit persons to
leave the park by way of a certain
path near Ninth avenue. Castlehun
started on the path in question, when
Norton halted him and told him to take
another thoroughfare. The citizen de
clared that he had a right to use the
path and intended to exercise it. Then
Norton placed him under arrest, took
him ..to the Stanyan street station,
searched him and had him conveyed to
the Hall of Justice, where he was re
leased on bail, and next day the case
was dismissed.
Castlehun sued for damages for ma
licious arrest and false imprisonment.
Judge Seawell holds that Norton be
lieved he was doing his duty for the
public good and bore no ill will toward
the plaintiff. He was acting under Coo
gan's orders, but there was no written
or posted order from the Park Com
missioners, and, says the court, even If
the Commissioners individually had or
dered the policeman to keep the path
closed on Sundays it would not have
availed, as the orders must be posted.
Therefore the damages for false Im
prisonment were awarded.
MARKS STONE ORDINANCE

him. A few days later he gave Ellis
a check for $62 60 on the American
Nutional Bank, purporting to be sign
ed by H. G. Garrison, and got the bal
ance of $42 50 in cash. The check
wat presented for payment to the bank

LEGISLATORS GATHER AT CAPITAL
TO STUDY THE POLITICAL FIELD
Several Fights for Preferment Are Settled
TWO -PROMINENT ASPIRANTS FOR THE HONOR OF BEINO CHOSEN PRESIDENT PRO TEM OF THE SENATE WHEN
â¢IT CONVENES AT SACRAMENTO AND WELL-KNOWN MEMBER OF THE ASSEMBLY WHO WILL BE, IN ALL
PROBABILITY, TEMPORARY PRESIDING OFFICER OF THE HOUSE.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 31.âThe gath-
ering legislators are content to sit to
night, and watch the good people of
this city let bedlam loose ln frenzied
welcome to the New Year. A quiet
discussion on topics political is im
possible and many a fight is as yet
undeveloped, as no man of all the law
makers cares to express his views
through a megaphoneâthe only prac
tical way to wedge an opinion through
the hurricane of noise.
However, by what seems to be gen
eral consent, some things are prac
tically admitted. None of those here
question the fact that Frank C. Pres
cott is backed by the organization for
Speaker of the House and probably
will get the office. Lou Martin is also
conceded a victory in his ambition to
serve as sergeant at arms of the Sen
ate, and J. T. Stafford as sergeant at
aims of.the Assembly.
.For President pro tern, of the Sen
ate there is a contest between Edward
1.. Wolfe of San Francisco and Frank
W. Leavitt of Oakland, with the ma
jority holding the view that Wolfe is
in* the lead with every prospect of
carrying the victory. Jacob Step
pacher and Clio Lloyd are candidates
for chief clerk of the Assembly, each
with firm friends behind him, and the
outcome of this friendly race is in
d<,ubt.
L. A. Hilborn practically has been
conceded the secretaryship of the Sen
ate. â¢ Candidates for the lesser offices
ar 'numerous, but they are awaiting
the arrival of a greater force of legis
lators before giving public announce
ment to their ambitions.
Senators John N. Anderson, John B.
Irish, Samuel 11. Kambo, Charles M.
Shortridge and E. F. Woodward and
Assemblymen Paul Arnerlch, F. W.
Barnes, R. H. E. Espey, Miguel Estu
dilio, R. H. Jury, S. H. Olmsted and
Ernest Weyand arrived here early this
afternoon, but their presence did not
stir things much. There was little
buttonholing indulged in by them and
it was plain that each was' awaiting
the arrival of greater numbers before
starting in the work of heating up the
caldron of political strife.
There was a smell of paint and new
ly plied soap in the Capitol building

scrubbed as never before and no grime
now disfigures their Carara figures.

tion had told and when the Senate and

List of Appropriations Required Is
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 31.âA list of
the appropriations that the University
of California expects to receive from
the present session of the Legislature
was presented to Governor Pardee to
day by a committee from the Board of
Regents, consisting of President Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler and Regents John
A. Britton, R. J. Taussig, Judge Charles
W. Slack and Attorney Charles Snook.
In addition to the general sum for
maintenance as fixed by law, appro
priations for an agricultural building
and a university farm were pointed out
as of being of prime importance. Pres
ident Wheeler stated that while plans
had been prepared for a $500,000 build
ing, the university would be content
with half that amount for the erection
of a portion of the structure. It was
stated that a good farm could be pur
chased for $100,000.
At the suggestion of the members of
the pedagogical department of the uni
versity a bill appropriating $10,000 for
a teachers' training school, to be con
ducted in conjunction with the univer
sity, will be presented.
That a special study of the diseases
of grapevines may be made under the
auspices of the university, an appro
priation of $5000 a year will be urged,
instead of $1500, granted two years ago.
The system of farmers' institutes has
grown to such an extent that $6000 will
be needed by the university agricultur
ists during the next two years to prop
erly carry out their work.
One of the most important appropria
tion bills that wiP be presented on be
half of the university will be an electric
power plant for the Lick Observatory.
Governor Pardee was told that if the
university were granted $10,000 a plant
worth ac least a third more than that
amount could be installed, as Director
W. W. Campbell had been promised
necessary machinery either as a gift or
at cost. The committee pointed out
the fact that at the present time the
observatory is lighted with kerosene
lamps that greatly endanger the place
and that the telescope mechanism has
to be moved by hand.
Governor Pardee waa noncommittal
as to the assistance he would be able
to give to thq proposed bills, nor would
he promise to sign any of them, de
claring that the financial demands on
the State are so heavy that he would
have to reserve his decision ln the mat
ter until a later date. Â«

HARBOR COMMISSION REPORT.
Shows Unprecedented Increase in
Tonnage and Foreign Shipping.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 31.âThe bien
nial report of the State Harbor Com
mission for the two fiscal years end
ing June 30, 1904, was submitted to the
Governor to-day. The report shows an
unprecedented increase in the tonnage
of foreign shipping. The commerce of
foreign ports with the port of San
Francisco has increased from an aver
age of 100 to 750 tens per diem in the
past wo years.
The increase in rental derived from
the State property along the water
front has been $50,000 over that of last
year. The total increase in revenue
over that of two years ago is $62,019.
The various items for which the $2,
-000,000 that the present Legislature is
expected to appzopriate for the seawall
is set forth in the report. These are:
For the seawall alone, $770,000: for pav
ing East street the entire length of the
proposed seawall. $125,000; for building
eleven modern cylindrical piers, 9600
feet in total length, $1,105,000.
The Commissic-n makes two com
plaints:
FirstâThat the docking- privileges are
continually abused by shippers who by
using the docks for warehouse pur
poses encroach on the freight handling
facilities.
SecondâThat the sewage of the
Sixth-street main pollutes the water
and Increases the expense of dredging
The board recommends that the sew
er main in question be removed to
Second street and that the sewage be
carried to deep water. The Commis
sioners make the recommendation that
they be given entire control of the wa
ter front, for the reason that all vessels
are accommodated and that they are
net dependent upon the consent of in
dividuals or corporations for that ac
commodation. It is also recommended
that the State condemn seventy feet
more in addition to the 200 feet width
which the board now controls along the
water front. The Increase in shipping
interests demands this measure.

assault upon and capture of Sungshu
Mountain yesterday by the forces be
sieging Port Arthur. The attack be
gan after the capture of Rihlung
Mountain. At first It failed on ac
count of the protection which the Rus
sians enjoyed and the desperate char
acter of their defense. Yesterday at
10 o'clock in the morning the Jap
anese exploded a series of mines and
immediately assaulted the works,
which they entirely occupied by 11
o'clock. The Russians exploded a
series of mines as they retired. A por
tion of the garrison retreated south

where they were buried by the debist
thrown up by the explosion Â«f theit
own mines.
CHEFU, Dec. 31. â Heavy fighting
has been going' on for some time at
the positions stretching â¢ between
Pigeon Bay and the new city of Port
Arthur. Eye-witnesses say that at one
of these positions the Russians lost
one-half of a detachment of 500 men.
One of these observers asserts that
the JaDanese in one of their attacks
ran into a terrific hail of shells from
quick-firers and lost 4000 . killed and
wounded. He Was employed by the
Japanese to assist in removing the
dead and wounded and picked up the
body of a Russian major general,
whose rank he recognized by his uni
form and insignia.
Chinese who arrived here to-night
from Dalny report that the Japanese
made a night attack on December 29
to the northeast of Port Arthur. The
Russians sortied, and, after three
hours' brisk fighting, the Japanese re
treated.
The refugees invariably state that
the Japanese greatly fear that the
Russians have mined the whole of the
city.
BERLIN. Dec. 31.â1n consequence
of the capture of Rihlung fort, Ger
many's most conservative military ob
serversâmen like General Meckel â
feel Justified in forecasting- the fall of
Port Arthur not later than February
1. They regard the taking of Rihlung
as by far General Nogi's most import
ant achievement. They assert that if
the Japanese can hold that position
the real "beginning of the end" it>
Anally at hand.
It is pointed out that General Nogi
is able, for the first time, to attack
the main defenses of the fortress
through an enfilading fire on three
sides. As soon as he succeeds in plant
ing heavy artillery on Rihlung thÂ«Â«
Russians will be unable to withstand
long Japanese flanking attacks.
German critics declare that no army
in the Â«world could have done better
at Port Arthur than the Japanese and
that if they had captured the fortress
any sooner than they are likely to do
it would have been a military miracle.

HELENA, Mont., Dec. 31.âStill per

trusts Attorney General James Dono
van to-day in the last hours of his
term of office began suits against the
alleged Beef Trust under the criminal
code. This is the first time in the his
tory of the United States where actions
were brought against an alleged trust
under this code.
The suits are brought against Ar
mour & Company, Swift & Company,
Cudahy & Company, the Hammond
Packing Company of Chicago and the
Hammond Packing Company of Pueb
lo, to prevent them doing business in
Montana. The defendants are charged
with conspiracy in unlawfully combin
ing to fix the price of certain articles
of commerce for consumption by the
people of Montana, and that in pur
suance of this conspiracy did actually
carry out a restriction of trade in the
sale of meat and meat products in this
State by creating a monopoly in the
sale of such articles. Upon the filing

CLAIMS TO HAVE FOUND

Retired French Naval Officer Says
Abdominal Band Will Prevent
Mai de Mer.
Special Cable to The Call and New York
Herald. Copyright, 1005, by the New York
Herala Publishing Company.
PARIS, Dec. 31.âDr. M. A. LeGrand,
one of the most eminent surgeons in
the French navy, now retired, believes
he has discovered the only sure pre
ventive of seasickness. This is nothing
more or less than a pliant band that
will sufficiently compress the abdomin
al wall to prevent the displacement of
the viscera. Researches conducted by
Dr. LeGrand show that this method
has been successful in 67 per cent of
cases. The strong point in favor of
the system is that the patient need not
modify his usual diet.

FEDERAL OFFICIALS INDICTED
FOR ALLEGED COMPLICITY IN
THE OREGON LAND FRAUDS.
Roosevelt to-day directed the removal
from office of John H. Hall, United
States District Attorney for Oregon.
Hall has been prosecuting officer of the
Government in the land fraud cases,
and the removal is made in conenction
with them.
The announcement of District Attor
ney Hall's removal was made by At
torney General Moody as he left the
White House after a conference with
the President. He declined to say what
charges, if any, had been made against
Hall, but added that for the good of the
service it was believed best to dispense
with him, particularly in connection
with the land fraud cases in Oregon,
the prosecution of which had been con
ducted by Hall.
Earlier in the day Senator Fulton of
Oregon had a talk with the President
concerning the land fraud cases.
Hall was indorsed for reappointment
by Senator Mitchell and Representa

PORTLAND, Or., Dec. 31.âWhen
John M. Hall, United States District
Attorney for the District of Oregon,
was shown the dispatch from Wash
ington announcing the determination
of the President to relieve him ftom
office he was thunderstruck. He had
had no previous warning from Wash
ington that the blow would fall and
could not at first realize the import of
the matter. As the extent of the an
nouncement dawned upon nim he be
came violently angry, condemning
several of the officers of the Govern

his removal as the act of personal
enemies. Later Hall became calm arid
discussed the situation coolly. He
made the following statement:
"If It Is true that the President has
removed me I have no knowledge of
what prompt&d him to take this ac
tion. I have not been advised by any
person of the nature of any charges
against me. But I Intend to go to the
bottom of this affair and have no fear
but that I can convince any fair man
that I have never been guilty of any
act while ln office that would even re
flect any discredit upon me.
"I do not even know who has pre
ferred the charges against me.

PORTLAND, Dec. 31.âUnited Statei
Senator John H. Mitchell, Representa
tive to Congress Blnger Hermann and
George Sorenson, formerly a deputy
sheriff of Multnomah County, were
jointly indicted to-day by the Federal
Grand Jury.
The indictment alleges that John H.
Mitchell and Binger Hermann did, in
January, 1902, unlawfully and felonious
ly conspire together and with each
other, and with S. A. D. Puter, Horace
G. McKinley, N. W. Tarpley, Emma L.
Watson, Salmon B. Ormsby, Clark E.
Loomis and William H. Da/vis and oth
ers, to defraud the Government of the
United States out of a portion of its
public lands, situated in township 11
south, range 7 east, by means of forged
and false affidavits and fictitious per
sons, and that in furtherance of such
c onspiracy S. A. D. Puter did, on March
9, 1902, pay to John H. Mitchell the sum
of $2000 to secure his influence with
Binger Hermann, then Commissioner of
the General Land Office in Washington.
It alleges that, acting upon the sug
gestion and the wish of Senator Mitch
ell and influenced by him, knowing that
the transactions were unlawful and
felonious, Binger Hermann used his
power as Commissioner of the General
Land Office to expedite twelve claims
in township 11-7 and had them passed
to patent when he knew them to be il
legal and not according to the require
ments of the law.
The indictment also alleges that on
March 28, 1904, George Sorenson offered
to John Hall, District Attorney for the
United States in Oregon, the sum of
$5000 with intent to influence the said
John H. Hall in his official capacity
when acting upon indictments returned
against S. A. D. Puter, Horace F. Mc-
Kinley et al. to defraud the Govern
ment of land in township 11 south,
range 7 east.
CONSPIRACY IS CHARGED.
The alleged connection of Senator
Mitchell and Representative Hermann
with the alleged conspiracy dates back
it is said to the time when Mitchell re
ceived the letter from "a prominent at
torney in Oregon" introducing S. A. D.
Puter as "a responsible business maa
of Oregon."
The Government will, it is said. aaÂ»
tempt to prove mat Puter and Mitch
ell and Hermann were well acquaint
ed, that Puter was an ardent support
er of Mitchell in the Senatorial cam
paign of 1898 and that all of them
have been personally acquainted for
years.
In 1902, the Government allege*,
Puter went to Washington on busi
ness connected with the lands of 11-7,
in which he was at that time inter
ested. The lands were held up in the
General Land Office and Puter
thought that it would be of benefit to
himself and his fellows to go to Wash
ington and see what could be done to
expedite them to patent.
The Government will attempt to
prove that before he left Portland ":iÂ©
went to F. P. Mays and secured from
him a letter to Senator Mitchell,
though in fact, according to the Gov
ernment, he was already well known
to the Senator. Arriving at Washing
ton the land speculator went, so evi
dence will be offered, to the office oZ
Senator Mitchell and conversed with
him in regard to having his claims
taken from the suspended list and put
through to patent as soon as possible.
He told the Senator, it is alleged, that
he had already sunk a large amount
of money in the claims and that Em
ma L- Watson, a hard working and
honest girl, had also Invested in them
at his suggestion. It was necessary
for him to have some Influence with
the Commissioner of the General
Land Office to secure favorable rec
ognition of his claims and he there

G. Morris, a wealthy resident of Ore

â¢â¢week on her way to Los Angelel, CaL,
with .her husband for his health. Mrs.
Morris one year ago had a very large
cancer In each breast and was pro

about a year ago. in two weeks, by Dr.
Charoley, the noted cancer specialist at
'26 Third street. San Francisco, with his
painless remedy, which has cured thou
sands of similar cases here and else
, where.
Mrs. Morris called on Dr. Chamley
during her stopover In San Francisco,
and after examination by several phy
sicians .was pronounced entirely cured.
This examination was made to test the
remedy. The complete cure astonished
the physicians. The breasts are both
normal In size and are perfect.
. Mrs. Morris and her husband are both
v.cry appreciative of the excellent cure
and the moderate fee, and gave her
picture for publication, saying that all
papers should say more about Dr
Chamley s wonderful work for human
ity. Mrs. Morris at first had only a
smal-I lump In one breast, but was told
by a physician to wait; so she did and
soon b.oth breasts were cancerous.
Some" friend sent her Dr. Chamley's
excellent book on "Cancers and Tumors
Cured Without Knife or Pain," which
she found full of testimonials, some of
whom she knew and went to see. The

Fewer Lynchings, Legal
Hangings and Homicides
Ifork the Record of 1904
9 â  â â 
Special Dlapatch to Tht Call.
CHICAGO, Dec 81.âOf much interest
and significance are the figures con
tained In the Tribune's annual review
of 1904, issued to-day. Especially sat
isfactory is the showing that there
were fewer lynchings than in any pre
vious year since 1885.
There is a marked falling off in the
aggregate donations to educational,
philanthropic and religious purposes.
There is a decrease in the number of
legal hangings, in the total of defalca
tions, forgeries and bank wreckings
and in the number of homicides.
Fire losses show a small Increase.
In a general business, manufacturing
and commercial way the latter half of
the year was a graduated improvement
over the first six months.
The lynchings for the year number
87, as compared with 104 the previous
ytar, 99 In 1902 and 135 in 1901 Of the
B. lynchings $2 took place in the South
and 5 in the North. There were 83
negro victims and 4 whites. Two wo
men wer â¢ among the number. The
highwater mark for lynchings was in
1>92, when mob vengeance was wreaked
tt. 235 persons.
Mississippi heads the list of States,
with eighteen lynchings. Arkansas and
divide the second place with
.' -v en teen each. Kentucky. Virginia,
Texas and South Carolina each has
fewer ihan half a dozen cases to its
discredit. Every State of the Upper
Mississippi Valley escapes without a
blemish.
The alleged causes of lynchlngs were:
Murder. 36; race prejudice, 19; attacks
on women, 20; murderous assault, 4;
conspiracy to murder, 2; unknown, 2;
insults, 2: threats, 1; robbery, 1.
In the list of great disasters the burn
ing of the steamboat Slocum, when
10S1 lives were lost, was the worst.
Fires number 1006; drownings, 2745;
explosions, 556; falling buildings and
l:ke casualties, 306; mine disasters, 589;
sti rrns and cyclones, 243; lightning,

FEDERATION OF WOMEN'S
CLUBS AGAIN PERTURBED
(Question of Admitting Men to Mem
bership Will Stir Up a right in
Next Convention.
LOS ANGELES, Dec. 31.âShall men
be admitted to membership In women's
clubs? Shall the California Federation
of Women's Clubs, after four years'
history as a strictly women's organiza
tion, strike out the word "women's"
and beco-me simply the California Fed
eration of Clubs 7 ..
These Questions will be brought up
before the federation's convention here
In February, and the hottest fight
known In women's clubdom is in pros
pect. The subject was mildly broached
at the meeting ln Sacramento last year,
but was coldly received. Now the de
termined spirits in the southern part of
the State have determined to present it
anew in the form of an amendment to
the constitution and to support it with
all their strength. They say they have
found men to be potent helpers In the
work undertaken by women's clubs all
over the country, the Long Beach Ebell
being the first to demonstrate their
usefulness by Impressing them into
service as honorary members.
It is known that there will be de
termined opposition to the proposed
amendment, some having gone so far
as to say that they will fight It to the
bitter end, even to the disruption of
the whole organization if necessary.
So it looks as though lively history
may be made February 7, 8 and 9.
Mrs. Jo*kill Evans Cowles is slated
for the presidency of the federation
to succeed Mrs. Georga Law Smith.

but who has never practiced his profes
sion, preferring the life of a teamster,
confessed in the police court to-day
that for twelve years he has been living
a double life, having two households
and two sets of children.
Rump was arraigned in court on a
charge filed by his legal wife, who lives
ln the eastern part of this city and has
two children. She said they had been
married thirteen years. Several years
after marriage she discovered her hus
band's relations with another woman.
She tried in vain to end them without
bringing the situation to the notice of
the authorities, and for twelve years
this remarkable condition has existed.
R'imp's other wife and three children
live in the western part of the city and
he divided his time and love between
the two families.
When Rump ceased to contribute to
ward the support of the first wife she
filed a complaint against him. After
the man's confession Judge Luders
fined him $50 and costs. Having no
funds, Rump went to the workhouse.

STRANGER THAN FICTION.
A Remedy Which Has Revolutionized
the Treatment of Stomach
Troubles.
The remedy Is not heralded as a won
derful discovery nor yet a secret patent
medicine, neither is it claimed to cure
anything except dyspepsia, indigestion
and stomach troubles with which nine
out of ten suffer.
The remedy is in the form of pleas
ant tasting tablets or lozenges, contain
ing vegetable and fruit essences, pure
aseptic pepsin (Government test), gold
en seal and diastase. The tablets are
sold by druggists under the name of
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets. Many in
teresting experiments to test the diges
tive power of Stuart's tablets show
that one grain of the active principle
contained in them is sufficient to thor
oughly digest 3000 grains of raw meat,
eggs and other wholesome food.
Stuart's Tablets do not act upon the
bowels like after dinner pills and cheap
cathartics, which simply irritate and
Inflame the intestines withc-ut having
any effect whatever in digesting food
or curing indigestion.
If the stomach can be rested and as
sisted in the work of digestion it will
very soon recover its normal vigor, as
no organ is so much abused and over
worked as the stomach.
This is the secret, if there Is any se
cret, of the remarkable success of Stu
art's Dyspepsia Tablets, a remedy
practically unknown a few years ago
and now the most widely known of any
treatment for stomach weakness.
This success has been secured entirely

simple because there can be no stomach

Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets act entire

pletely, so that it can be assimilated
Into blood, nerve and tissue. They cure
dyspepsia, water brash, sour stomach,
gas and bloating after meals, because
they furnish the digestive power which
weak stomachs lack and unless that
lack is supplied it is useless to attempt
to cure by the use of "tonics," "pills"

Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets can be

THE PARK
Party in Automobile
Has Startling
Experience.
ââ¦ â 
A party of automobilists had an ex
citing experience with a pair of masked
highwaymen shortly after 1 o'clock
this morning on the ocean boulevard
just outside Golden Gate Park. Two
thugs, one armed with a rifle and the
other with a revolver, held up an auto
loaded with a gay party out celebrat
ing the Now Tear.
When the chauffeur was ordered to
throw up his hands, he brought the
machine to a sudden standstill. Ben
Peckermann, one of the party, jumped
out and as he did so the chauffuer
started the auto and disappeared in
a cloud of dust, followed by two bullets
from the rifle in the hands of one of
the footpads.
Peckermann, left alone with the two
footpads, was quickly relieved of $20
and a gold watch and chain. He was
then ordered to run and his captors
disappeared in the park. He made
his way to the Park police station and
reported the robbery.
The members of the automobile party
who escaped are William Ryan, Charles
Wall, Julius Under, Leo Rosenthal
and two men named Koenigr and No
lan.

â¢Rear Admirals at New
Tear's Reception Denied
â¢ CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON, Dec, Sl.âPresident
Roosevelt has directed that only line
officers who have obtained flag com
mand- rank be presented to him as
"rear admirals" at the New Tear's day
reception on Monday in the White
House.
The controversy raised by the bureau
chiefs of the Navy Department, who
claimed the right to the title of "rear
admiral" because their positions carry
the rank and pay of that grade, became
acute a few days ago. The problem Is
still in the hands of Attorney General
Moody for a final opinion, but E. P.
Hanna, solicitor of the Navy Depart
ment, has rendered an opinion regard
ing the titles to be used on New Year's
day. Secretary Morton to-day, by di
rection of President Roosevelt, em
bodied it in a memorandum. It may be
taken as the straw which shows the
way the wind is blowing.
Attorney General Moody's opinion
probably will fix It for all time that the
only rear admirals ln the navy will be
line officers who go to sea and are eli
gible to command squadrons. This is
the memorandum:
"The official designations of the chiefs
of the several bureaus of the Navy De
partment and of the head of the office
of Judge advocate general to be used
pn the occasion of the official presenta
tion on New Tear's day, 1905, will be
as follows: Chief of the bureau of yards
and docks, chief of the bureau of
equipment, chief of the bureau of nav
igation, chief of the bureau of ordnance,
chief constructor, engineer in chief,
jpaymaster general, surgeon general,
Judge advocate general.
"An officer of the staff who was re
tired while chief of bureau will be des
ignated by the title of the chief of the
bureau of which he was head and the
name of said officer, with the word 're
tired.' For example. Paymaster Gen
eral A. S. Kenny. U. S. N., retired;
Surgeon General W. K. Van Reypen,

PRISON GRAVES
FOR CONVICTS
Men Killed in the Outbreak
at Folsom Are Buried in
the Penitentiary Cemetery
WARDEN IS DISPLEASED
Denounces Sensational and
Untruthful Reports Pub
lished Concerning Trouble
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Dec. 31.âThe last
grim scene ln the attempted prison
break at Folsom was enacted to-day
when the bodies of the three convicts â
H. C. Hill, J. C. Quinlan and W. Mor
ales âkilled by the guards, were laid
away in the cemetery, with stone slabs
bearing only their prison numbers to
mark their graves. Contrary to ex
pectation, the burial was gone about
without the slightest attempt to im
press upon the rest of the prisoners
the warning which the incident natur
ally conveyed to those of rebellious
spirits. Warden Yell evidently was
not disposed to have the dead con
victs remembered by their associates
as martyrs. They were buried without
any more ado than if the procedure
was merely a circumstance in the
prison management.
Warden Yell volunteered to The Call
correspondent to-night an expression
of the great annoyance he feels in
common with the other officers of the
prison at the sensational stories which
have been printed in a certain paper
in San Francisco since the attempted
break.
The Warden declared that his name
and the names of his officers have been
blazoned forth daily as authority for
statements which they never made and
never dreamed of making. Incidents
purporting to relate to the break were
detailed at length, he declared, which
had no foundation whatever except in
the imaginations of those who placed
them before the public. The Warden
spoke of one incident to illustrate what
he meant.
DENOUNCES STORIES.
A story was printed Friday with
great particularity as to detail that the
break had been so timed by the con
victs as to enable them to jump on
the prison locomotive as soon as it
arrived on the grounds and ride on it
to Folsom and to freedom. The Call
this morning showed by the statement
of one of the leading conspirators, J.
W. Finley, personally verified as cor
rect by Warden Yell himself, after in
vestigation, that this was not the plan
of the convicts at all, but that they
intended to cross the American River
at once and seek their liberty on the
farther shore. Yet the same locomotive
yarn was again wired from Folsom.
"To show how absurd that story is,"
said Warden Yell to-night, "I have
only to mention the fact that as soon
as the locomotive enters the prison
yard a switch is thrown and securely
locked. This effectually imprisons the
locomotive. If any body except the
prison officials start the locomotive the
switch will not be unlocked and the
locomotive will be ditched before it can
get outside the grounds. I had this
arrangement put into effect the very
day 1 came here, and it has been faith
fully observed ever since, and all the
prisoners know it. I do hope that thai
story of escape by the locomotive
route will now rest in peace."
BETTER PROTECTION NEEDED.
Wardtn Yell said he hoped that the
lesson of the attempted break would
not be lost in the forthcoming Legisla
ture and that more walls would be
provided for safeguarding the prison
ers, instead of depending wholly upon
the guards. Asked with reference to
the procedure to be followed in bring
ing the live conspirators to justice
when they recovered from their inju
ries, Warden Yell said he would pro
duce all the evidence and then allow
the law to take its course.
District Attorney Seymour said to
night that he would prosecute Convicts
Carson, Quijada and Finley under the
new State law which provides the
death penalty for any prisoner serv
ing a life sentence who assaults a
prison guard with a deadly weapon.
Seymour said he would take the neces
sary steps as soon as the wounded
prisoners were able to leave the hos
pital. The State is obliged to defray
the expense of these prosecutions. The
prosecution of the convicts recaptured
after the break of July 27, 1903, has al
ready cost the State In jury and wit
ness fees, etc., fully $15,000. Seymour
said it was the policy of Governor
Pardee to spare no expense on the
prosecutiori of those guilty of break
ing the laws while undergoing the laws'
penalties, and that the present cases
would prove no exception.
Guard Charles Jolly, who was acci
dentally shot ln the neck during the
fight with the convicts, is still resting
easily, and no complications are looked
for. Captain Murphy is rapidly re
covering from his wounds. The condi
tion of Convict Kelly, wh6 was rid
dled with bullets, is still serious, but
the other wounded prisoners appear to
be on the way to recovery.

AND SENATOR

fore would like to have the help of
Senator Mitchell.
PUTER VISITS HERMANN.
The Government will attempt to
prove that he promised to make it
right with the Senator in the event
that he could secure the good will and
assistance of Hermann. The Govern
ment contends that Puter then went
to see Binger Hermann, then Com
missioner of the General Land Ot
flce, and talked the matter over with
him. Hermann, it is alleged, did not
see that anything could be done to the
lands unless some action would be
taken which would make the transac
tion of record in the office. Puter
then got into a hack, it is alleged, and
went to the hotel of Senator Mitch
ell, the Dewey House, and told him of
the alleged conversation with Com
missioner Hermann. The famous Pu
ter-Watson affidavits, according to thy?
Government, were then made in the
hotel of the Senator, and it alleges
that Senator Mitchell-dictated the al
leged papers to his own stenographer
and had them delivered to puter as
soon as finished. The affidavits which,
it is asserted, told of the settlement of
the land and of its cultivation and th i;
characters of the persons making the
filings, were then, so the Government
will attempt to prove, taken to Her
mann, who, it is alleged, took them
under consideration.
On March 6, 1902. the Government al
leges, Hermann wrote a letter to Sen
ator Mitchell stating that he had ex
pedited the claims as per his request.
This is the letter which was introduced
in the first trial and over the identifica
tion of which both Senator Mitchell
and Hermann were in doubt. It is also
the letter which Commissioner W. A.
Richards made his trip to Portland
from Washington to identify. This let
ter stated that Hermann had expedited
the claims and that the clerk of the
proper division would take the claims
under his consideration and make an
examination of them. This, it is alleged,
was done, and on the following day the
clerk recommended they be returned to
the local land office at Oregon City for
further proof and investigation. The
clerk recommended, it is stated, that
the entries seemed to be fraudulent and
not according to law. These were the
Davis lands, in which it is alleged W.
H. Davis of Albany and others were
Interested.
RESORT TO BRIBERY.
Loomis, then forest superintendent,
according to the Government; in the
meantime reported against the claims
or part of them, but after this report,
it is alleged, D. W. Tarpley went to
Davis and got him to raise $200 each
from fourteen men in order to secure a
favorable report from Government
Agent Ormsby, who it is alleged had
been also told to make a report. Davis,
it is charged, raised $1460 of the al
leged amount, which was said to be
divided between Tarpley and Loomis.
The Government will try to show that
when Loomis received this money he
wrote a letter to Hermann asking that
something be done as to the expedition
of the lands, or at least as to their fa
vorable consideration.
George R. Ogden was the clerk hand
ling the business, and it will be alleged
he prepared a report and sent it to Her
mann especially calling attention to the
alleged Loomis and Davis letters ask
ing that the lands be considered but
admitting, so it is stated, that the laws
had not been observed.
This report was dated March 7,
but on March C Hermann had ordered
the claims expedited and he assented.
When he saw the report made by Og
den, however, it is said, he hesitated,
and when Puter came to see him it is
alleged he told Puter that he thought
the alleged matter looked pretty bad
and that he was afraid the claims
would have to go back to the Oregon
offices for further investigation. Puter
by this time had expended, it is al
leged, about $6000 on the deal, and
when he was told this, it is alleged,
he went back to Mitchell. It is said
he told the Senator his influence was
necessary to induce Hermann to put
the lands through without sending
them back to Oregon. It is added that
he told the Senator that if the claims
went back to Oregon they would be
lost to him, and all the money he had
put into them would be gone.
MITCHELL ACCEPTS MONEY.
At this time the Government will at
tempt to prove that Puter laid down
two $1000 bills on the table in front
of the Senator, and it will also try
to prove that he told Mitchell to take
them and see what he could do to help
the lands through the patent. The Sen
ator, it is alleged, did not wish to take
all of the money, and, it is said, pushed
one of the bills back; but the Govern
ment asserts that Puter insisted that
$2000 was not too much to pay for thÂ«
alleged service, and that the money
was taken by the Senator. The Gov
ernment will offer evidence that Sen
ator Mitchell told him that he would
do the best he could for him.
The next day. It is also alleged, Puter
went to Hermann and, it is said, asked
him how things looked, and it is stated
Hermann told him that he thought
upon a reconsideration it would be
possible to put the lands through. He
asked Puter, it is assert ed, to come
back in the afternoon ai.d, it is said,
he had turned the matter over to W
A. Richards, his assistant. Puter, it
is alleged, went to Mitchell and got
him to take him to Richards and in
troduce him. The Senator, it is con
tended, introduced him as one of the
best men of Oregon, perfectly reliable
and upright.
ACCOMPLICES CONFESS.
It is alleged that this evidence is
supported by those who It is asserted
have confessed, and is said to be cor
roborated in many details which have
not been and will not be made public
at this time, which have been gath
| t-red with tireless energy by Colonel A.
R. Greene, the Government special in
spector, and his assistants.
The indictment against Sorenson was
made upon the testimony of United
States District Attorney John Hall, who

HERMANN IS ANGRY.
Says Indictment Is Result of Con
spiracy and Persecution.
PORTLAND, Dec. 31.âCongressman
Dinger Hermann, who will leave for
Washington to-morrow morning, is
sued a statement to-night in which he
says:
"The indictment returned against me
is the result of the basest of conspira
cies and malicious persecution. I have
been a resident of Oregon since boy
hood and have been intrusted with
many transactions affecting the pub
lic interests, and with my fellow men,
and in them all my single endeavor
has been to discharge my duty and
preserve my honor. Mistakes may
have sometimes been made, and I may
have been imposed upon, but I am not
conscious of having violated any obli
gation as an officer or as a private
citizen. If frauds were practiced
on the office, the imposition was as
grossly perpetrated upon me as com
missioner, as upon others in the office.
"I rely upon my vindication before a
trial jury, before which, as a citizen,
I shall be protected against mere in
sinuations; base persecution and per
jured testimony."
MORE INDICTMENTS TO COME.
Secretary Hitchcock Says the Work
Has Been Only Begun.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 3t.âThe news
of the indictment of Senator Mitchell
and Representative Hermann for con
spiracy to defraud the Government out
Of public lands had been expected for
some time by those officials having to
do with the case, and it came as no
rurprise. Secretary Hitchcock frank
ly said that he had looked for the in
dictment at any time. Attorney Gen
eral Moody declined to make any com
ment.
Secretary Hitchcock consented to
make a brief statement concerning the
case. He said:
"While we all regTet that men oc
cupying high stations ln public life
phould get within the clutches of the
law, the Interior Department and the
Department of Justice had their duty
to perform. These land fraud indict
ments are the result of two years of
the most searching investigation and
are a part of the unalterable determin
ation of the President and the adminis
tration to bring to justice all violators
of the law, he they high or low.
"These indictments," continued the
Secretary, "will not be the last. More
are to follow, although I believe I can
say that the investigation will involve
no more officials as high in public ser
vice as are these two members of
Congress. All the cases will be placed
in the han'ls of the Department of
Justice, and the prosecution will be
vigorous. I cannot say just how many
additional indictments will be return
ed in the various cases, but it is true
that this is simply a beginning."
COOL WELCOME
TO DR. IRVINE
Huntingdon Vestrymen Dis
play Displeasure When
He Appears to Explain j
â¢
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HUNTINGDON, Pa., Dec. 31.âFol
lowed by private detectives. Dr. Ir- j
vine arrived here to-night from Phil- j
adelphia. In passing from the station
to Railroad street he was recognized
by a crowd of his former parishioners,
who began to point toward and cry
out: "There's Irvine." The detectives, J
also in carriages, had a hot chase after
Dr. Irvine to the house of W. F. Hel
ller, the Huntingdon vestryman who
did not deny having signed the pre
sentment against Bishop Talbot. Hel
lier refused admission to reporters,
though Dr. Irvine could be seen strid
ing up and down the dining-room floor.
Before reaching Hellier's home Dr.
Irvine went to the home of Mrs.'Elea
nor Jackson, mother of A. T. and H.
S. Jackson, whose names were attach
ed to the presentment.
"I hope you have come here to set
tle this matter that has caused us so
much trouble," said Mrs. Jackson. "I
hope you will make an explanation of
this affair."
"That is what I have come for," said
the priest. "It all will be explained."
Just then Miller S. Jackson, one of
the petition signers, entered.
"Good evening," said Dr. Irvine
warmly.
"Good evening," said Jackson coldly,
and passed on.
W, G. Miller, the vestryman of St.
John's Episcopal Church who obtained
the signatures of the Huntingdon
presentors to the presentment of Dr.
Irvine against Bishop Talbot, said to
day:
"The paper which my brother vestry
men, Messrs. Langdon, Denithorn,
Jackson and the others, signed was a
petition addressed to Bishop Tuttle
praying that the controversy between
Bishop Talbot and Dr. Irvine be per
manently settled. It was not a present
ment In any sense, for I have in my
possession a copy of the paper. There
were two separate parts to it/ one con
taining the petition itself and the other
a blank paper, both of which were at
tached. I received the papers from the
Rev. Dr. Irvine, at whose request I ob
tained the vestrymen's signatures and
to whom I afterward returned the pa
pers. Langdon and Denithorn both
signed the papers about the middle of
November. All the vestrymen seemed
to comprehend the purport of the peti
tion and said it was a good move. I se
cured also their signatures to the blank
which was attached, after stating to
them that this precaution would be ad
visable in the event that the original
petition should become lost. I signed
only what I believed to be a simple
petition, and not a presentment to have
Bishop Talbot's official acts investi
gated. The others I believe acted sim
ilarly. If our names are attached to
the presentment and the signatures are
genuine then there must have been
some fraudulent manipulation of the
blank paper which contained them."
Miller's change of position was a
great surprise. It is known that he is
personally friendly to Rev. Dr. Irvine
and, it is said, antagonistic to Bishop
Talbot. The Indignation of the vestry
men, Langdon and Denithorn, at find
ing their names on the presentment
had provoked them to threaten prose
cution against Miller and to cause his
method of procuring their signatures
to be rigidly investigated.

NOBLE'S OATH
AGITATES THE 1
ARISTOCRACY
Carl of tankekville, -whose
TALL PROM ORACK HAS AGI
TATED ALL ENGLAND.
Special Dispatch to The Call
LONDON, December 31.âEvangelical
circles are greatly agitated over the
question whether the Earl of Tanker
ville can longer be regarded as a
"brand plucked from the burning"
since his frank and Impenitent ac
knowledgment that he sent Dr. Lunn a
message that he 'could go and be
d âd." Ordinarily an oath from the lips
of a noble lord occasions no surprise,
bat..when it comes from Lord Tanker
ville it is a different matter, because
for years he has enjoyed a reputation
for piety somewhat unique in the Brit
ish peerage.
â â¢ In his early days he had a reputation
of a different sort. Then he was known
as a jolly good fellow who could sing
a'roystering song with good effect, and
to the proverbial proficiency of a troop
er in the use of "cuss words" added
.that of the sailor, for he had been in
both the army and navy. But he sub
sequently underwent conversion and in
18&2 toured the country with the late
'Revivalist Moody, often taking the
place of Sankey in singing hymns at
ihe famous revivalist's meetings, for
his voice is .an exceptionally fine one.
GREAT REJOICING
Great was the rejoicing over this evi
dence of his religious zeal and he was
held up as a shining example for other
lords who would save themselves and
their country from perdition. Since his
accession to the family titles and the
What Sulphur Does
For â¢ the Human Body in Health and
â¢ â¢â¢ â  Disease.
The mention of sulphur will recall to
many of us the early days when our
. mothers and grandmothers gave us our
daily dose of sulphur and molasses
every spring and fall.
. It was the universal spring and fall
"blood purifier," tonic and cure-all, and
â  -mind you, this old-fashioned remedy
waa not without merit
The idea waa good, but the remedy
waa crude and unpalatable, and a large
quantity had to be taken to get any
effect.
; Nowadays we get all the beneficial
â  effects of sulphur in a palatable, con
centrated form, so that a single grain
Is far more effective than a tablespoon
] ful of the crude sulphur.
â¢' In recent years, research and experi
ment have proven that the best sulphur
* for medicinal use ie that obtained from
Calcium (Calcium Sulphide) and sold in
drug stores under the name of Stuart's
Calcium Wafers. They are small cho
colate coated pellets and contain the
active medicinal principle of sulphur in
a highly concentrated, effective form.
â¢ Few .people are aware of the value of
this form of sulphur in restoring and
maintaining bodily vigor and health;
sulphur acts directly on the liver, and
excretory organs and purifies and en
riches the blood by the prompt elimina
tion of waste material.
. Our grandmothers knew this when
they dosed us with sulphur and mo
.- lasses every spring and fall, but the
crudity and Impurity of ordinary flow
ers of sulphur were often, worse than
- the disease, and cannot compare with
. the modern concentrated preparations
â¢of sulphur, of which Stuart's Calcium
Wafers Is undoubtedly the best and
..â most widely used.
â¢They are the natural antidote for liv
Â«r and kidney troubles and cure consti
pation and purify the blood in a way
that often surprises patient and physi
cian alike.
Dr. R. M. Wilkins while experiment
ing with sulphur remedies soon found
that the* sulphur from Calcium was su
perior to any other form. He says
' For liver, kidney and blood troubles
..especially when resulting from constl
'' pation or malaria. I have been sur
.. prised at the results obtained from
Stuart's Calcium Wafers. In patients
suffering from boils and pimples and
even deep-seated carbuncles, I have re
peatedly seen them dry up and disap
pear in four or five days, leaving the
skin clear and smooth. Although Stu
art's Calcium Wafers is a proprietary
article, and sold by druggists, and for
that reason tabooed by many physi
. cians, yet I know of nothing so Bafe
â  and reliable for constipation, liver and
"kidney troubles and especially in all
; forms of skin disease as this remedy."
At any rate people who are tired of
pills, cathartics and so-called blood
"purifiers," . will find in Stuart's Cal
cium Wafers, a far safer, more pala
table and effective preparation.
IRISH ESTATE
IS DENIED HER
American Wife of British
Earl Disappointed Because
Spouse Sells Home in Erin
â¢
FAVORITE OF TENANTS
Need for Monoy Prompts Hus
band of Lady Essex to Dis
pose of Roscommon Realty
fci;ec'al Disnatch to Vha Call.
LONDON. Dec. 31.âAmong the inti
mate friends of the American Countess
ol" Ersex it is an open secret that she
la much disappointed at her husband's
decision to sell his Irish estates in Ros
ommon. The former Miss Beach
Grant was eager to be the next Ameri
can woman to establish a residence in
lieland, bo'.h on account of her par
tiality for the country itself and be
cause of the pleasant relations which
exist between her and the tenants on
the Essex estate. But the Earl "needs
the m>;ney." and so his wife's wishes
had to be 'Unregarded. He has been
selling off risht and left lately, a cleri
cal â¢ living" and the right to collect toll
for farm produce on* part of his Wat
ford estates being among the other as
sets on which he has realized.
The countr:- around the Earl's estate
in Roscommun Is most picturesque, and
Lady Essex was fond of spending a
few days annually in the vicinity. The
fishing, shooting and hunting are ex
ceptional, and she always recommended
her friends to spend as much of their
annual holidays there as possible.
It is somewhat significant that since
the Earl's marriage the rents have been
considerably reduced and greater con
siderations have been extended to some
of the poorer tenants, who were not al
ways able to meet their liabilities. If it
were not for these considerations, which
the tenants attribute to Lady Essex,
they would not be sorry to sever theh
connection with his Lordship, because
he hardly ever took any interest ln
them before his marriage beyond exact
ing the last fraction that was due.
The last time that Lady Essex went
over the estate she told some of the
tenants whom she visited that she
would like to come and live among
them during a portion of the year at
least, and that she would look out for
a residence for that purpose. At the
time she was staying with Mrs. Adair
at the latter's place in Donegal, and
she had made such a favorable impres
sion on every one that Donegal and
Roscommon, which adjoin, were de
lighted at the prospect of seeing Lady
Essex setting up a residence in the
neighborhood.
DEMANDS THAT TURKISH
BRIGANDS BE PUNISHED
American Legation in Second Note
Calls Porte's Attention to Failure

CONSTANTINOPLE, Dec. 31.âThe
American legation has sent another
note to the Porte pointing out that
the brigands who looted a caravan be
longing to the American house of Mc-
Andrews & Forbes of Smyrna, near
Aleppo, Asiatic Turkey, recently, have
not yet been punished.
The note demands that prompt In

was committed, to arrest and punish
the followers of the notorious Kurd
ish chief, Abraham, who looted the
caravan.
Steamship Abydos to Be Save*
LONDON, Dec. 31. âAdvices re
ceived here to-day said that the own
ers of the German steamship Abydos,
from San Francisco, which went
ashore in the Straits of Magellan oil
December 26, had made a contract
with local salvers in the sum of $75,
-000.
ancestral estates of some 13.000 acres,
on the death of his father in 1899, he
has not been so much in evidence at
religious gatherings, but still no sus
picion was entertained that he had be
come a backslider until it was aroused
by his use of the big "D" in his mes
sage to Dr. Lunn and intensified by
publicly expressed "disgust" for what
he termed the latter's "evangelical ef
fusion." The sting of that character
ization lies in the fact that Dr. Lunn
enjoyed no little renown as a religious
exhorter before he found a more profit
able field for his talents in the estab
lishment of a tourists' agency.
Dr. Lunn, it will be recalled, con
ceived the brilliant idea of chartering
a liner for a cruise in the Mediter
ranean under the auspices of a choice
band of peers and at rates commen
surate with the exalted social privi
leges which purchasers of tickets
would enjoy on the voyage. Accord
ing to the doctor, Lord Tankerville ac
cepted the chairmanship of the enter
prise and the free use of two state
rooms for himself and his wife, and
all went swlmmongly until a news
paper, greatly lacking in respect for
coronets, got hold of the story and
made some caustic observations con
cerning the "titled touts" who figured
In the scheme.
SEEKS A RETRACTION.
Thereupon Lord Tankerville Issued
a public disclaimer of any connection
with the affair and asserted that the
use of his name had been entirely un
authorized. Dr. Lunn sought & re
traction. After leading him a' stern
chase through the wilds of Northum
berland Lord Tankerville refused to
see him and sent the message which
has caused his old cronies to chuckle
and the pious associates of his later
years to grieve. Dr. Lunn, it Is un
derstood, will go to law over the mat
ter and society is looking forward to
the threshing out of the case with,
keen delight.
Meanwhile Lord Tankerville does
not appear to be worrying much over
the outcome. At his ancestral seat,
Chillingham Castle in Northumber
land, he recently entertained his High
ness the Duke of Johan-Albrecht of
Mecklenburg-Schwerln and allowed
him to shoot the leader of the famous
herd of wild cattle which roam over
Cedzow Forest.
Lord Tankerville Is 54 years old and
is doubly fortunate in possessing an
American wifeâformerly Miss Lenore
Van Marter of Tacomaâand a little
sen, Lord Ossulston, who is the hand
somest boy in the British peerage. His
portrait recently appeared In this cor
respondence. Lord Tankerville, It Is
Interesting to recall, has some sort of
hereditary claim to piety. One of his
ancestors. Baron Ossulston, was a
commissioner in Queen Elizabeth's
time for the suppression of heresy.

TIME IN AUTO
Author Conrad Becomes De
votee of Prevailing Craze
and Buys a Fast Machine
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call.
LONDON, Dec. 31.âUntil Joseph Con
rad's motor car knocked down and ran
over a man near Rochester* the other
day it was not generally known by the
sailer-novelist's admirers that he"went
in" for motoring. Conrad caught the
prevailing craze about six months ago,
when he invested in a Panhard, and
sine - then he and his wife have spent
most of their time in motoring in the
neighborhood of Hythe in Kent, where
the author of "Typhoon" does his work
now It was while making the run up
to London from Hythe the other day
that the novelist had his first accident
with his car. The man he ran over was
a laborer named George Field. Mr. and
Mrs. Conrad, their child and Conrad's
chauffeur were in the car at the time.
The injured man brought suit against
the chauffeur, who waa driving the
car in the Rochester County court and
was awarded $105 damages, which was
paid by Conrad.
It was announced recently by no less
an authority than the London Times
that the Right Hon. John Morley was
understood to have consented to write
for a magazine concerning the impres
sions gained on his recent tour in
America. In response to my request
for further information on the subject
Morley writes to say that the Times
report is wholly unfounded.
KIPLING AT THE "CAPE."
Not since his attack of pneumonia in
the United States, several years ago,
has the state of ..udyard Kipling's
lungs made it possible for him to en
dure the English winter. Hence his
present habit of spending the time
from the middle of December to the
beginning of April at the "Cape," for
which v/ith the members of his family,
he left by the Armadale Castle cm Sat
urday last. Last year Kipling did a lot
of motoring during his stay in South
Africa and also took quite an active
part in the political campaign that was
In progress at the timeâmaking several
rousing speeches in favor of the Im
perialistic candidates.
The attempt of William Waldorf As
ter's London magazine, the Pall Mall,
to compete in this country with the
higher priced American monthlies has
failedâthat is the significance of the
coming reduction in its price from a
shilling to sixpenceâthe "popular"
magazine price over here. However, it
Is maintained that the Pall Mail's
really high quality will be kept up, and
the announcements made by its editor,
George R. Halkett, for the new year,
indicate a good intention, at least. They
include a new serial story by H. G.
Wells, Joseph Conrad's "Recollections
of a Seafarer's Life," a new poem by
Thomas Hardy and stories by E. W.
Hornung and other favorite writers.
Fac simile reproductions are to be is
sued shortly of an unusually grim
manuscript which is owned by the Im
perial Library at St. Petersburg. This
is a Koran written by the hand of the
Caliph Osman in 644 A. Dâ and the
parchment is stained with ita writer's
blood, for he was assassinated while
reading from it. The reproductions of
the manuscript, which is one of the
most precious of Oriental documents,
will be limited to fifty.
MEMORIAL FOR HENLEY.
A movement is now on foot in Lon
don to place a memorial to the late W.
E. Henley in St. Paul's Cathedral, and
this will probably take the form of a
replica of the famous bust of Henley
executed by Rodin, the French sculp
tor.
Memories of Sir "Walter Besant's most
famous work have been aroused by the
death of Spencer Charrington, M. P.
Besides being the oldest member of the
House of Commons, he was head of the
East End brewery firm, Charrington &
Co., which played so important a part
In "All Sorts and Conditions of Men"
under the name of Marsden & Mes
senger's brewery.
"John Strange Winter," author of
"Bootle's Baby" and many another ro
mance, Is about to follow an example
set a while ago by her contemporary,
the versatile George R. Sims. Like
Sims, who invented "Tatcho," Mrs.
Stannard some time ago turned her at
tention to toilet secrets, and now a
"hair grower," a hair dressing and a
skin lotion are about to be brought out
under her name, or rather un
der her more familiar pen name.
"John Strange Winter" hasn't yet de
cided definitely on names for her prepa
rations, but for the hair-grower Louis
Wain, the cat artist, has designed
quite a taking trade mark. It is a kit
ten, with the legend, "Since using
I have grown into a Persian."
Sims did not give up his newspaper
and dramatic work after launching
"Tatcho," and Mrs. Stannard has no
idea of stopping writing novels, no
matter how successful her various
preparations may become. At the first
bush the novelist as a hair-producer
seems a surprising combination, but
then there has for some years been an
implied connection between literature
and abundant lock 3.

this morning and has remained with

the rain had reached about every
portion west of the mountains. The
â¢heaviest fall Is reported on Cuyamaca
Mountain, where at 4 o'clock this aft
ernoon the gauge showed that the fall
had been more than 1 inch. The low
est fall was reported from a number
of â  places where It was thought half
an . inch had fallen during the day.
-Planting is going on throughout the
county and was in progress before the
rains came. The rain will start the seed
and with later rains of reasonable ex

â¢rain will help the oranges, which are
now filling out and coloring.

BURTON' HOLMES. THE FAMOUS
LECTURER, WHO WILL BE
HEARD IN THIS CITT.
This season the Burton Holmes
travelogues are to be given in Lyric

Twelve years ago Mr. Holmes began
his lectures more as an amusement
than as a profession in Chicago. Year
by year they have grown in popularity
until now his tour extends annually
from the Pacific to the Atlantic and
even to England, where last season he
made a great success and where he is
again to be heard this coming spring.
Mr. Holmes has kept abreast of the
times in every way. ' Starting with
beautifully colored lantern slides as
the only means of illustration he added
colored moving panoramas and orig

Two Mysterious Fires Call

Four Men Are Overcome by
Smoke and Jackies Fall
Into River During Battle
PHILADELPHIA, Dec. 31.âHundreds
of marines and sailors, buckets in hand,
to-day aided the navy yard fire depart
ment and the crew of the Government
tug Modoc in fighting two small fires
of mysterious origin at League Island,
sparks from which threatened to de
stroy the great drydock in course of
construction. The fires started within
an hour of each other on the platform
of a towering wooden crane on the
bank to the west of the drydock. The
crane, 175 feet high, was saved by a
party of marines who climbed up the
blazing structure and fought the fire at
close range.
Four marines were overcome by
smoke, and two sailors from the Den
ver in their eagerness to reach the
scene fell into the river. They were
rescued.
Rear Admiral Dickens, the command
ant, probably will appoint a board of
inquiry and have a thorough investiga
tion made as to the cause of the fires.
The marine guard was at once doubled.

CRESCENT CITY, Dec. 31.âGeorge
Dunn, a miner, aged 84 years, was
found murdered Friday night in his
cabin on the Grants Pass and Cres
cent City wagon road, forty miles from
this city. He had been beaten to
death with a dub. Physicians who
examined the body say that the crime
must have been committed during the
early part of the week.
Dunn trp,Â» one of the best known
miners in this section and was reputed
to be quite wealths'. Robbery is sup
posed to have prompted the crime, but
It is believed that the murderers did
not secure more than $100.
Three tramps have been arrested on
suspicioo and the Sheriff and his depu
ties are now searching for a fourth
hobo, who is known to have been in
the company of the men in custody.
The prisoners were in the vicinity of
Dunn's cabin about the time he came
to his death and were without funds.
When arrested they all had money and
moreover had spent considerable coin
at a roadhouse.

STOCK BROKERS
FEAR AN ATTACK
Sharp Dip in Prices Is Due
to Dread of Dire Happen
ings Predicted for Future
SPIRIT'OF UNCERTAINTY
Steady Uplifting of Prices
Makes Last Week of Year
in Wall Street Cheerful
NEW YORK, Dec. 31.âThere waa a
rather marked revival of apprehension
of a successful attack upon the stock
market to-day, caused by a renewed
proclamation of dire things to happen
next week by the same authority that
upÃet the recent market. The sharp
dip in prices to-day was clearly as
signable to that dread. The day's trad
ing was in consequence rather ani
mated, contrary to expectations, as the
piincipal motive for holding a session
was to bring together the members to
the annual New Year frolic which fol
lowed the sesalon of the exchange. The
spirit of uncertainty thus awakened in
duced considerable throwing over of
stocks accumulated during the week's*
rise and resulted in an effective cur
tailment of that rise.
Amalgamated Copper showed Itself
sensitive to the new threat to the mar
ket, but that stock was supported in
the later dealings and closed un
changed. The Pacifies were notably
weak and were affeoted by the denial
of a rumor set in circulation that the
Northern Securities decision had been
handed down. United States Steel pre
ferred was under pressure and showed
poor rallying power, its fresh decline
in the late dealings contributing to the
irregular closing.
The hank statement reflected only a
part of the expected cash gain, but the
shifting of trust company acounts and
the annual settlements were to be reck
oned with as confusing influences on
thf statement, and the showing was
not an inlluence on stocks. Neither was
there anything in the day's news af
fecting properties to influence the op
erations in the market.
Total sales of bonds, par value, $3,
-365,000.
The closing week of the year has
been a cheerful one in Wall street.
There has been a quiet and stejrdy up
lift to prices, without signs of feverish,
ness or speculative excitement except
that the trading showed considerable
growth of animation toward the last
by roason of the encouragement caused
by the advance. The distrust and un
settlement due to the sudden collapse
of last month have largely subsided as
the sensational features of the cam
paign against prices were eliminated.
The news affecting property values
has been uniformly favorable. The
needs of an uncovered short interest
undobutedly plaj-ed some part also in
the buying. But the conviction seems
well founded that the demand was
largely of a more substantial character.
Investors were in the market in antici
pation of the resources which are to
accrue to them from the January dis
THE EMPOBIOL
bursements of interest, which are to be
on a scale unprecedented.
A summary of the year's operations
on the Stock Exchange shows that the
volume of business was greatly ln ex
cess of last year. Dealings in the list
ed stocks showed an increase of more
than 20,000.000 shares compared with
1903. In unlisted stocks the .business
for 1904 was fully 6.500,000 shares in ex
cess of 1903, while the dealings in Gov
ernment, State and unlisted bonds was
greater by many millions of dollars.
The close of the year was celebrated
with much enthusiasm on the Stock
Exchange. Long before the close of the
market the galleries were crowded with
Bayly dressed women. Promptly at
noon the celebration began, the pro
gramme being opened with "America"
by a military band. This was followed
by other patriotic airs, while on the
floor the members engaged in impromp
tu football games and the throwing
of confetti.
CHICAGO. Dec. 31. âA vaudeville per
formance was arranged for this after
noon at the Board of Trade to t,ake the
place of the customary throwing of
bags of flour and grain to celebrate the
closing of the business of the year. A
stage was fitted up In the "cell room"
and professional talent engaged for the
occasion. All money cleared by the
performance will be given to charity.

won her love.

fortnight ago to Henry Chamberlain,
a business man, with interests at Peta

was the shock to her sensibilities that

she was sincerely attached. Mrs. Mar
tens said to-day:
"The marriage of Miss Schumacher
to : Mr". Chamberlain has been post
poned. It is not Miss Schumacher's
wish to have the matter become pub

the affair. She has left Berkeley for

â¢deeply deplorable. Mr. Chamberlain's
action in the matter and his disappear

to all of us. /
"The wedding- was to have taken

' OAKLAND, Dec. 31. âGeorge E.
Faw, - the local agent for the American

arrested this morning on a charge of
misdemeanor embezzlement. The ac
cusation is made by R. D. de Lappe,
the general agent of the company,
who says that while in his employ last
July Faw insured Miss Maggie Norton
and' collected a premium of $54, for
which he failed to account.
But for the fact that Faw was
â¢working on a 20 per cent commis
sion, which, deducted from the
amount of the premium reduces the
alleged embezzlement to $41 20, Faw
would have been forced to face a fel

HIGHWAYMAN IS POLITE
H. D. Perry Puts to Flight a
Stranger Who Ordered Him
to Hold Up His Hands
ALAMEDA, Dec. 31.âHold-up men
and their pistols have invaded this city
ln the wake of the burglars and house
breakers who were very active here last
week and to-day two instances of en
counters with footpads were made
known by persons who were forced to
look into the dangerous end of the
highwaymen's revolvers.
Albert Moses, who is a student at the
University of Pennsylvania, and who is
spending the holiday season with rela
tives here, reports that while he was
walking along Central avenue, east of
High street, Thursday night at 8
o'clock he was confronted by a strangei
who stepped from behind a tree and,
shoving a pistol into Moses' face, com
manded him to hand over what cash he
had. 1 Moses asserts that he gave the
robber 50 cents, and when he was pre
paring to pass him his watch the foot
pad said: "Please keep that. All I want
is money." Moses describes the high
wayman as short and stocky and boy
ish in actions and speech.
H. D. Perry is the second person to
relate how he met a highwayman
Thursday night. He was traveling
along Buena Vista avenue, near Ever
ett street, on his way to the home ot
Henry Heintz, at 1117 Broadway. Be
fore reaching his destination, Perry
says, he was accosted by a would-be
robber, who ordered him to throw up
his hands, at the same time making a
move as if to draw a gun. Perry says
that he made ready for resistance and
when the footpad observed this he
broke and ran. Perry Is unable to give
any description of the man.

charges made there are no assets and
there was no dividend.
The indictments were brought upon
the complaint of Mrs. Lucy Allen and
Mrs. Kate Boyle of San Jose, who
claim to have bought $700 worth of
stock from Smith. His operations have
been wide spread, and among those
who have purchased stock from him in
this city are Mrs. M. C. Smith. E. M.
Hill, Robert Moles, George Lloyd, W. F.
Lloyd, Octavia Coffey, Jessie D. Woods,
H. L. Schnoor of Berkeley and Mrs. C.
Schnoor of Oakland.
One of the largest losers by Smith's
operations Is E. G. Northup of San
Jose. Northup sold out his piano busi
ness to Smith.for 50,000 shares of stock
in the syndicate and some cash which
he says he never received.
Northup visited Oakland to-day. Of
Smith he said:
"The company is in name only. Smith
is the whole thing. He was formerly
a Methodist preacher and came here
from Detroit about five years ago and
held meetings In various cities. Then
he went back over his course and sold
the people whom he had met stock in
his mining company. I trusted him
because I knew him to have been a
preacher. He has no mines and I have
letters written by him to people in an
swer to their queries about their stock
in which he says the man who has the
working of the mine has taken the
money and run away. He also said that
the mine is bonded and he cannot say
whether it is good or bad. Upon such
security he has robbed hundreds of
people. He is supposed to have a mine
at Sonora and another at Tonopah."
KILMER ADMITS GUILT
TO AUBURN AUTHORITIES
Confesses That He Took Part In
Robbery of Sa loon-Keeper at
Rock Creek.
AUBURN, Dec. 31.âFred Kilmer,
who was arrested by Sheriff Keena
yesterday, made a confession to-day.
He admitted that he and two others
held up, gagged and robbed Moore,
the Rock Creek saloon-keeper, last
Wednesday morning. Kilmer met his
pals at Lincoln while all three were
waiting to take a train out. Noticing
Kilmer's pistol, the others asked
to borrow it in order that they might
turn a trick. Kilmer agreed and told
them of Moore's place near Auburn.
They got to Moore's at daybreak.
After the robbery the two strangers
started back to Lincoln, saying they
were going to San Francisco. Kilmer
served a term in the Oregon State
Frison at Salem. He says he thinks
the others are ex-convicts, but does
not know them.

2148 Center Street. Dec. 31.
The two days' conference of the
Cordilleran section of geologists,
which has been in progress in South
Hall on the university cafnpus, came
to a close this afternoon. Scientists of
note read papers at the morning and
afternoon sessions to-day to an audi
ence which included many savants of
the West, who have a profound inter
est ln the problems involved in papers
discussed by the speakers.
John A. Reid of Reno was to have
read a paper on "A Detail of the
Great Fault Zone of the Sierra Ne
vada," but in his absence Professor A.
C. Lawson read the composition.
Charles E. Weaver of the University
of California dealt with the palaeon
tology of the Martinez group.
Under the title of "Stream Piracy
in the Upper Pecos, New Mexico," W.
G. Tight of Albuquerque, N. M, dis
cussed a peculiar phase of the actions
of some rivers in the Southwest. He
said that the elevation of the creta
ceous beds which extend U'om the
Gulf of Mexico in a general north
western direction to the frontal ranges
of the Rocky Mountains and which
underlie the Liana Estacada of West
ern Texas and Eastern New Mexico
developed aormal drainage in the di
rection of their upper surface, which
extended from the mountain axis in
a general southeastern direction, in
several parallel lines. The beds are
composed of strata of extremely vari
able resistance to erosion.
The lower Pecos of New Mexico
was developed on the western margin
of this extensive uplift, along the
strike of the beds. Its headwaters
have extended northward and have
captured the headwaters of several of
the southeastward flowing streams, the
most important being the tributaries
of the Red River, the Brazos and the
Colorado of Texas. The old deserted
channels extending from the present
headwaters of these streams to the
Pecos are represented by chains of
saline basins.
Professor Andrew C. Lawson de
scribed the geology of the Robinson
mining district of Nevada. His paper
gave an account of the stratigraphy,
structure and perography of a limited
portion of one of the Basin ranges of
Eastern Nevada. â¢
George D. Louderback of San Fran
cisco discussed the characteristics of
the Mesozoic as studied
ln Southwestern Oregon, comparing
them with those of California.
"Lawsonite" was discussed by A. S.
Eakle of the State University. He re
viewed what has been published con
cerning the crystallization and occur
rence of Lawsonite ln California anil
elsewhere, with a chemical analysis
and discription of the crystal habit
and rock associations.
Ten minutes was devoted by Vance
C. Osmont of San Francisco to a dis
cussion of the areas ln the tertiary of
California, with a description of new
species.

Pneumonia Develops and the Aired

CHICAGO, Dec 31. â Theodore
Thomas, who has ben suffering from
the grip for several days, Is now criti
cally in w ith pneumonia at his home,
4o Bellevue place. A consultation of
physicians was held during- the morn
ing- and the serious condition of the
veteran orchestra conductor was an
nounced.
While up to last night Thomas had
held his own under a severe cold and
bronchial affliction, pneumonia de
veloped during the night and this
morning he was considerably worse,
Oxygen was resorted to late this after
noon. After the consultation it waa
announced that there was no imme
diate danger of death, but no attempt
was made to conceal the alarm felt
over the serious turn in the condition
of the aged patient. Thomas' age, 69
years, the physicians admit, greatly
reduces his chance for recovery.

RIPLEY OSES
PLAIN WORDS
President of the Santa
Fe Scores the Interstate
Commerce Commission
DUBS IT A CATSPAW
Says It Permitted Itself to
Be Used in Furtherance
of a Suit for Damages
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO. Dec. 81.â"The Inter
state Commerce Commission has per
mitted itself to be used aa a catspaw
in the furtherance of a suit for dam
ages."
President B. P. Ripley of the Santa
Pc Railroad had this to say to-day in
reply to the charge that the Santa Fe,
through Its traffic head, presumably
Paul Morton, with the sanction of
President Ripley, had some time ago
made a secret rate in favor of the
Colorado Fuel and Iron Company
amounting to a discrimination of ap
proximately $1000 a day. The reve
lation of this alleged secret rebate
had come about in the course of a
hearing two weeks ago in the case or
the Caledonian Coal Company before
the Interstate Commerce Commission.
The specific charge was that the Santa
Fe, through Biddle, Its freight traffic
manager, had charged the Colorado
Fuel and Iron Company $1 10 a ton
for coal transported from Trinidad,
Colo., to Demlng. N. M., or $1 15 less
than the rate named in the tariff filed
with the commission.
Ripley, after reviewing - the facts in
the case, continued:
f The arrangement which is under
discussion was made with the El Paso
and Northwestern Railway Company
for its own benefit and use and in no
manner discriminated against any in
dividual, firm or corporation in the
coal business. Neither this company
nor any of its officers is in any man
ner, either financially or otherwise, in
terested in the Colorado Fuel and Iron
Company or Its operations, or in any
other coal company, and this state
ment includes Mr. Morton, who is not
now an officer of the company, but
was at the time this arrangement was
made. We have broken no law and
have nothing to apologize for. The
Interstate Commerce Commission has
permitted itself to be used as a cats
paw In the furtherance of a suit for
damages Instituted by a coal company
which is located ln a totally different
section of the country and which has
been neither injured nor discriminated
against by the action on which the
complaint Is based.
"This suit has been brought in New
Mexico. The railway company is
willing and ready to try such a suit
on its merits before a court selected
by the plaintiff. It would seem, how
ever, that the coal company Is making
an effort to try its case before the com
mission and in the newpapers for the
purpose of creating public prejudice
in Its favor.
"Contrary to Its usual practice, a
copy of the order of the commission
directing the investigation of the case
in El Paso, Tex., was not mailed or
sent to the officers of the railway com
pany and they did not know of its
scope until they appeared before the
Commissioners in that city. Neither
were the investigation and hearing
conducted because of any specific
complaint of injurious discrimination
In rates, but because of general ru
mors, which the commission claims to
have heard, that the coal rates in this
territory were 'out of line.' "

Prison on two charges of burglary.
He is accused of entering the room of

Marvel Among Skyscrapers
Is Building Just Opened
by the New York Times
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Dee. ll.âThe New
York Times ushered in the new year by
opening- its new sky-scraper at Forty
second street and Broadway, popularly
known as the Upper Flatiron. This is
the most remarkable structure in New
York, If not ln the world.
Here are some of the features of the
building: 618 steps on stairways: 26
stories above ground; 3 stories below
ground; 2 galleries; 1 pumping station
61 feet below the street; 31 stories in
all.
It is the tallest structure in the city,
being 362.7 feet from the curb to the top
of the observatory rail and 476 feet
from the base to the top of the flag
pole: 41,463 tons of material were used
in the structure. A subway railroad
passes obliquely through the building's
basement, no part of the subway con
struction touching the building at any
point.
Sand cushions under the subway
columns stop all vibrations. There is
almost as much of the building under
ground as is visible above the ground.
An extraordinary newspaper work
shop, with an area of more than 16,000
square feet, is located under the sub
way tracks.
The building has the highest electric

ADVERTTSEMENTS.
The
baldheaded
row
Baldheaded men have
long been a standing
joke in every theater
going community, but
nevertheless the loss of
the hair and the unsightly
condition which it imposes
upon the unfortunates who
compose the baldheaded
row is often a source of
keen mortification.
The baldheaded row,
however, will speedily
become practically a thing
of the past, because the
more Coke Dandruff Cure is
used the more it proves
itself capable of positively
growing hair on bald heads,
a claim which was not
originally made by the
inventor. The formula, as
originally evolved, was
intended only to eradicate
and cure conditions of
dandruff and diseases of
the scalp, but to the
surprise and delight of
constant users, it quickly
demonstrated its ability to
restore the hair follicles to
their youthful vigor and
thereby produce a glossy
and luxuriant growth of
hair.
Thousands of people
in every rank and walk of
life have sent us grateful
testimonials attesting the
truth of this. You don't
have to take our word or
theirs for it. If troubled
with dandruff, falling hair
or any scalp disease, try
it for yourself. We are
quite willing to abide by
the result. Your druggist
will tell you the same
story. Ask him.

Hospital Surgeons Succeed
in Saving Quartet of
Men From the Pyrenees
After a night of revelry four shep
herds who hall from the distant Pyre
nees were found yesterday morning
overcome by gas in their room at the
Basque Hotel, 1347 Powell street. The
men were taken to the Central Emer
gency Hospital, where the usual reme
dies were applied, and all four were
soon out of danger.
The names of the men are Juan Na
vasco, Pierre Gilarne, D. Arreverrie
and P. Aguerreberre. None of them
has been ln this country over two
months. To economize they shared he
one little room at the hotel, aa they
would have shared a shepherd's hut in
their own mountains.
On Friday night Navasco began to
strum his guitar and hum songs of the
Basque country. Homesickness began
to tug at the heartstrings of the com
rades. Suddenly one proposed that
they levy upon the common treasury
and buy a little vino. The idea waa
promptly seconded.
A simple feast of bread and cheese
was spread and the jug began to circu
late freely. The guitar tinkled merrily
and all four joined in songs, for every
shepherd of the Pyrenees is a musician
born. They talked of the black-eyed
girls at home, of the dances of the folk
in their villages, of their mountains far
across the waste of waters.
They forgot that the rain was on the
roof, that they were among a strange
people and almost penniless. A shep
herd of the Pyrenees is always gay,
they said. And the revel kept up until
the quartet grew drowsy.
The landlord had warned them against
the light. It was neither from oil or
tallow, nor was it a torch, he explained.
It was a bewitched light and if blown
out would cause the death of the man
who extinguished it. But one of the
four forgot the admonition. The light
was blown out.
Yesterday morning Mrs. Yparra
guirre. the landlady, found gas
v>as escaping from the room occupied
by the shepherds. She unlocked the
door and summoned aid. Three of the
Basques were piled into an ambulance
and rushed to the Central Emergency
Hospital. The fourth was taken in a
patrol wagon.
All four wttj recover. As they lay
in their cots at the Central Emergency
Hospital they swore an oath that
they would never again have anything
to do with the bewitched light, that is
"neither a torch, a lamp or a candle,"
and must not be blown out. This was
the New Year's resolution of four
shepherds from the Basque country.

KOWALSKY CASE
ENDS SUDDENLY
Judge Kerrigan Gives Hus
band Divorce Decree on
the Ground of Desertion
SETTLEMENT IS MADE
Wife's Suit Not Pressed and
Property Interests Are
Adjusted Out of Court
The Kowalsky divorce case, about
which much secrecy has been thrown
since its filing and the trial of which
started last week behind closed doors
in Judge Sloss' court, came to a sud
den ending yesterday. Judge Kerri
gan, to whom the case had been trans
ferred, granted the divorce to the hus
band, Joseph N. Kowalsky, on a cross
complaint charging willful desertion.
The property interests have been set
tled out of court. The wife, Ettie
Kowalsky first sued for divorce,
charging her husband with being so
penurious that he allowed her only $2
a week. There were other grounds for
her action, which Kowalsky denied.
He was formerly a shoe dealer, but
now deals in stocks. His brother, H.
L Kowalsky, was his attorney arid a
witness in the case.
Judge Kerrigan yesterday heard evi
dence in the case of D. D. Griffiths
against Anita Griffiths, whom he mar
ried last January. She Is traveling
with the James Keane theatrical com
pany, and Griffiths accused her of in
fidelity, naming the head of the com
pany as corespondent. A deposition
is to be read before the case Is
decided.
By Attorneys Bishop & Hoefier Mar
garet F. Butler yesterday sued William
A. Butler for divorce on the ground of
cruelty, charging him with having
abused and beaten her. Butler is the
son of the manager of the Baden Brick
Company. Suit for legal separation
was also begun by Mary Verdier
against Philippe Verdier, whom she
married in France in 1882, for deser
tion, and by J. L. Barton against Har
riet F. Barton for desertion.
FORGERY CASES AGAINST
McGLADE ARE DISMISSED
It Is Said That His Friends Will Now
Petition to have Him Released
oh Parole.
Two cases against Peter W. McGlade
charging him with forgery that have
been on Judge Cook's calendar for over
three years were dismissed yesterday
on motion of the District Attorney.
McGlade is now serving a sentence of
eight years in San Quentin. The rea
son given for dismissing the other two
cases was that Judge Cook is desirous
of having his calendar cleared, and as
the McGlade cases have not been tried
within the sixty days prescribed by law
there is no use in cumbering the calen
dar with them. The real reason is said
to be that McGlade's friends will now
make an effort to have him freed on
parole, the cases having been kept on
the calendar to prevent such contin
gency.
McGlade was bookkeeper in the office
of the Superintendent of Streets, and
on May 22. 1899, he was indicted on
three charges of forgery committed on
salary demands. On his trial on the
first case the jury disagreed three
times, but at the fourth trial he was
convicted on July 13, 1901, and sen
tenced to serve eight years in San
Quentin.
OLD GENTLEMAN' MANGLED
BY CAR AND MAY DIE
G. K. Butler, on Visit to Son, Fatally
Injured at Tlihtj-Ninth
Avenue.
G. K. Butler, a resident of Vallejo,
father of Police Officer Paul Butler,
who is the private secretary to Cap
tain Mooney, met with an accident
yesterday that will in all probability
terminate fatally. The old gentleman,
who is in his seventieth year, arrived
yesterday morning with the intention
of spending the New Year here, as
also the fortieth anniversary of his
marriage. He was on his way to his
son's home on Thirty-ninth avenue on
a Sutro car.
On arrival at the avenue he got off
and was crossing the track when an
inbound car struck him and knocked
him down. His right leg was broken
in two places and his right arm frac
tured. In addition to these injuries
he was hurt internally and suffered
what may prove a fracture of the
skull. The old gentleman was re
moved to the Park Hospital, where
Dr. Carl G. Wilson attended him. He
was later removed* to the French Hos
pital, where he lies in a precarious
condition.
ADVERTISEMENTS.
THE VALUE OF CHARCOAL.
Few People Know How Useful It Is
in Preserving Health and Beauty.
Nearly everybody knows that char
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
few realize its value when taken into
the human system for the same cleans
ins puroose.
Charcoal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the it is not a
drug at all, but simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present in
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
smoking, drinking or after eating
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural and
eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; it
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
All druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the best
charcoal and the most for the money
is in Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they
are composed of the finest powdered
Willow charcoal, and other harmless
antiseptics in tablet form or rather in
the form of large, pleasant tasting loz
enges, the charcoal being mixed with
honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell in a much improved condition
of the general health, better complex
ion, sweeter breath and purer blood,
and the beauty of it is, that no possible
harm can result from their continued
use. but on the contrary, great benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all
patients fuffering from gas in stom
ach and bowels, and to clear the com
plexion and purify the breath, mouth
and throat; I also believe the liver is
greatly benefited by the daily use of
them; they cost but 25 cents a box at
drug stores, and although in some sense
a patent preparation, yet I believe I
get more and better charcoal In Stuart's
Charcoal Lozenges than in any of the
ordinary charcoal tablets."

MISS MARIE R. VOORHIES A
WITCHING ARMY BRIDE.
IN ft BEAUTIFUL BOWER ft FftlÃ SOCIETY HftlD"
BECOMES WIFE OF CftPTftlN HftLDIMftND P. YOUfIG
BY SALLY SHARP.
When in the long stretch of yester
year was there daintier, winsomer
bride than Miss Marie Voorhies?âthe
lasjt..of the lovely Voorhies maids, of
whom there were four ere Cupid picked
them off with his little barbed arrows.
Promptly at four the bride entered
the music-room on the arm of her
father, Dr. Alfred Hunter Voorhies, her
attendant. Miss Florence Ives, leading
the way to the bridal bower. Here they
were joined by Captain Young, looking
very brave in his full dress uniform,
attended by his brother from New
York. Richard B. Young.
Bishop Nichols performed the cere
mony, which waa the fourth Voorhies
nuptials celebrated by the Episcopal
divine; arid behind this lies a pretty
story. Away back in the dark days of
the war a Tennessee regiment, while
pa'sfiing through Georgia, found its
chaplain very illâso ill that to go on
would .be death. So he was carried to
the home of Colonel Bailey, Mrs. Voor
hies' father, where he was tenderly
nursed back to health. Now this chap
lain was none other than the famous
Bishop Quintaxd of Tennessee, whose
niece wedded Bishop Nichols. And thus
the friendship of to-day was sown in
the long ago, in the soil of Christian
'charity.
â¢A fair picture was the bride in her
Chantilly lace robe, the bodice of which
was- cut square, with an alluring lace
yoke. . Her veil of tulle was caught in
piquant fashion with a spray of orange
blossoms, and on her arm she bore a
huge bouquet of lilies of the valley and
maidenhair.
: A handsome chap is the groom, of
ready wit and of soldierly bearingâ "a
. famously well-matched pair," said they
wh.i passed in review.
â¢ Miss Ives was a fetching maid in her
cream net gown; so, too, was Mrs. J.
.'Malcolm Henry, whose robe of net over
white satin was stunning; in her hair
. she. wore a violet orchid. Mrs. Voor
hies wore a beautiful black Chantilly
gown over white satin, wearing some
superb diamonds.
The. Voorhies home is admirably
adapted to large functions, the music
â¢room: dining-room, drawing-room and
library sweeping into one apartment.
Green and whiteâfit colors for nuptials.
â¢standing as they do for constancy and
faithâwere the tones used in the music,
room, red in the dining-room, where
ruby lights and Christmas berries lent
their cheer. Pink rosesâloads of them
. âlent their beauty and sweet breath
to ihe drawing-roomâa pretty picture
in truth.
Mrs. Voorhies and Mrs. Young were
assisted in receiving their guests by
Mrs. Malcolm Henry, Mrs. Francis J.
Sullivan, Mrs. H. E. Huntington. Mrs.
Edward Pond, Mrs. Reginald Knight
Smith, Mrs. Emory Winship, Mrs. A. S.
Baldwin, Mrs. Julian Sonntag, Mrs. 11.

â¢ Miss Irwin, Miss Katherirte Herrin.
Miss Helen de Young, Miss Jennie
Blair, Miss Ida Gibbons and Miss Alice

During the reception, from 4 till 6,
a smart crush passed through the
rooms, among whom were the stun-
Jiingest women seen abroad in many
moons.
. Likewise were there some mighty
smart men thereâbless them!
' A wedding needs a goodly sprinkling
of men to look smart.
'Captain and Mrs. Young depart this
'morning for the East, whither they will

SAN FRANCISCO, SUNDAY, JANUARY 1, 1905
TUMULT GREETS
THE NEW YEAR
Carnival Crowd Makes Merry
on the Streets as 1905
Opens Up for Business
EMULATES VAN WINKLE
Inebriate Falls Asleep in
December and Is Rudely
Awakened on January 1
Amid a blare of horns, a jangling of
bells and a screeching of steam
whistles, the year 1904 made its exit
and IUOS entered with its hopes, prom
ises and resolutions. San' Francisco
received the new-comer gleefully.
From 6 o'clock until midnight every
body who could crowd into Market
street mingled in the jostling stream
of humanity that moved along the
city's great thoroughfare. The crowd
was bo<stercusâ but ihere was little
rowdyism. The European carnival
spirit reigned all through the merri
ment. It was give and take with the
Jesting and buffoonery.
The street and sidewalks were soon
hidden under confetti. The tiny flakes
showered through the air, caught in
the whiskers of the venerable, dropped
down the backs of the ticklish, settled
in the tresses of the beautiful and un
settled the dignity of the supercilious.
So thickly did confetti cover the side
walks that enterprising small boys
scooped it up and resold it, keeping the
stuff in circulation.
Everything that could make a noise
was mustered into service. Horns, cow
bells, corncrakes, firecrackers and ev
ery known offender against the peace
joined in the din. Masks, false beards
and outlandish costumes lent the car
nival aspect to the crowd that filled
Market street, for New Year's eve is
San Francisco's Mardi Gras.
The affair was decidedly cosmopoli
tan. When a newsboy brushed the face
of Miss Pacific Avenue with a not
over clean feather duster the damsel
retorted with a shower of confetti.
Street sweepers rubbed shoulders with
men of millions. All social barriers
were leveled along Market street.
An evidence of the pood work done
in the year past and a hint as to what
will be done toward the making of a
bigger and more beautiful San Fran
cisco was the opening of the new Flood
building. The massive structure was
lighted from cellar to the topmost
story, and crowds surged through it
and admired.
Policemen stationed at short inter
vals along the streets in the crowded
districts kept the stream of humanity
moving. Only on rare occasions were
they necde<kJÂ«; Jhe wuppression of
hoodrnmism.
Among the throng were those who
were forming the annual resolutions
to abstain for un entire year. As usual,
the greater part of these kept bidding
farewell to their favorite mixtures un
til long after the whistles tooted in the
year l'M)5. Then they realized that it
was too late; they had got the better
of the new year and they resolved to
wait until 1905. Inebriates were not
unusually plentiful. Policeman Mui
phy located one with his head reclin
ing on a curbstone just before the first
dawn of 1905 crept over the hills.
"Wake up," ordered the policeman
'It's 1P05."
"G'wan; you're kidding," replied
thq stricken one. "Can't work any old
Rip Van (hie) Winkle gag on me."
"That's on the level," said Murphy.
The inebriated one began to sob.
"Grtat Scott! Haven't been home for
whole year. What 11 wife and fam
ily say? 'he mourned. "May be ain't
got wife and family any more. Slep'
whole year. May be home fallen in
ruins and my dog howling at garden
gate. Say, I'm Rip Van Winkle, kid
no wife, no family; home all gone."
"There is always a home for the Van
Winkle kids these days." said Police
man Murphy consolingly, as he steered
the inebriated man to a patrol box.
There were two wagons on duty at
the Central police station, and they
were kopt busy around midnight.
As the hands of the clocks stole
toward 12 all the noise creators joined
in a pandemonium. The minute hands
tarried an instant at the hour; then
they moved slightlyâl9o4 was with
the past and 100." was mustered in; the
tumult died and the carnival was over.
GRAIN BROKERS LIVELY.
Heroes of Wheat Pit Break All Rec-
The exit of the old year and the
coming of the new was marked by a
great demonstration at the Merchants-
Exchange grain board yesterday. Th&
new quarters are nearly ready for the
board at California and Leidesdorft
streets and the chance for a "lark" in
the old quarters was the last to be af
forded as a herald to the new year.
Perhaps this added zest to the demon
stration that the brokers contrived and
carried out to make the occasion
memorable and to break all records.
When the board was assembled yesÂ»
terday forenoon those who were in
the secret of the fun and who were
determined that no man should escape
until all the joy was over locked the
doors and all the inmates saw the
sport which in circus handbills would
be described as ' fast and furious"
from start to finish. Brokers Berg,
Buehr, Waterman, Rosenthal, Cutter,
Moseley and Bresse were chief insti
gators of the proceedings, but they
werekbacked up by all the others, who
had #ne of the times of their life.
Bald heads and other heads and
clothing were showered with bags of
flour of California make. Firecrackers
and bombs were exploded in all direc-.
tions and at everybody and the din
was something quite unparalleled out
side of a Chinese New Year fusillade in
the palmiest days of Chinatown. Men
of all ages and all degrees of custom
ary decorum and gravity threw up their
hats and yelled until they were hoarse.
Hundreds of men, attracted Ijy the
noise, crowded to the exhange vi
cinity to learn whether the bombard
ment of Port Arthur had not been
transmitted to San Francisco. When
it was all over the "boys" went out
laughing, some of them still white
with flour, but none the worse for
their bit of nonsense.

MAYOR MAKES
APPOINTMENT
Confirms Call's Prediction
by Naming Dr. Jules Simon
Member of Health Board
MAY PROMOTE ALTMANN
Rumor That School Director
Will Go on Works Board.
Oliver May Succeed Him
Mayor Schmitz yesterday announced
the appointment of Dr. Jules Arthur
Simon as a member of the Board of
Health. The appointment was exclu
sively foretold in The Call more than
three weeks ago. Dr. Simon takes the
place made vacant by the resignation
of Dr. J. C. Stinson.
Dr. Simon qualified immediately by
filing his oath of office and will issume
his new duties at c-nce. A special meet
ing of the Health Board will be called
by President Ward to induct the new
member into office.
Dr. Simon is a physician of high
standing and a specialist on nervous
and mental diseases. He graduated
from the medical department of the
University of California in 1875. Short
ly afterward he went to Paris, and
after serving as interne in the Hospi
tal de Rothschild from 1880 to 1882 he
became a member of the Faculty of
Medicine in 1883. Returning to this
country, he was clinical instructor on
nervous diseases from 1884 to 1890 and
was a member of the State Board of
Medical Examiners from 1887 to 1889.
He holds memberships in a number of
medical associations.
The political wiseacres are figuring
on a shift to be made on the commis
sions to which appointments will be
made by Mayor Schmltz on January 9.
It is said that the Mayor contemplates
the transfer of a. member of the Board
of Education, probably Director A. Alt
mann, to the Board of Public Works,
leaving a vacancy for David J. Oliver
Jr., who has been assured that he will
receive some appointment. In that case
the hopes of Thomas F. Egan will be
disappointed. Dr. Joseph Poheim
looms up as a strong candidate for Po
lice Commissioner, though Dr. George
Diucker and Arthur Dudley Cross are
mentioned for that post. Commission
ers Wreden, Voorsanger and Rogers
are sure of reappointment and William
H. Metscn is hopeful of being made

RESTAURANT MAN IS IIELB
VP ON HIS OWN DOORSTEP
William Berger was held up on
Thursday night as he was leaving the
Walton grill, 452 Ellis street, and now
lies in his room in a very badly bat
tered condition. He says the attack
upon him was a clear case of hold-up
by William Smith, a man who had
been In his employ for about two
weeks. During this period every night
when Berger was counting the cash
Smith was by and always took an in
terest in the proceeding.
Smith left Berger's employment of
his own accord about ten days ago.
Since then he has been loitering
around and several of the neighbors
have noticed him peeking over the
fence and watching what was going
on in Berger's place, the Walton grill,
425 Ellis street. On the night of the
attack Berger counted the money and
after putting it in his pocket started
for home. As he was going down the
back steps he was confronted by
Smith, who drew a pistol on him. In
his endeavor to avoid a shot from the
pistol Berger made a misstep and fell
down the stairs. His back was sprain
ed, his legs were hurt, his left arm
was broken near the elbow and he
received deep cuts over the nose and
right eye.
Berger's cries for help brought a
number of the cooks in the grill to
the rescue. After a hot chase Smith
was caught and locked up at the City
Prison. He is charged with assault
with a deadly weapon.
ing to the new year to-night with more
variety than ever before. This was due
to an almost balmy evening, that in
vited additional thousands to join the
multitude who streamed up and down
Broadway for at least two hours before
midnight. Toward Old Trinity, ever the
central point of the New Year's eve
festivities, the mob of downtown revel
ers moved. Here horns tooted the old
year out, while the chimes, which for
years have rung the half-hour before
the dying year's last night, sang their
happy omen of the incoming season.
The subway and the elevated and
surface roads were crowded to their
utmost capacity to-night with parties
bound to get as near to Trinity as they
could. The Brooklyn bridge and all the
downtown ferries added their quotas,
until by 11 o'clock Broadway was com
pletely jammed from the City Hall
down to the Battery. The streets run
ning to the ferries were lined all day
with venders, who did a great trade in
horns, rattles, whistles and other ear
splittmg devices.
At 11:45 the solemn chimes of Trinity
pealed forth their parting to the old
year, followed by the bells of nearly
every church in the city. Almost in
stantly the tumult of horns and whis
tles commenced, growing every minute
in volume until, as the midnight hour
struck, the whistles of a thousand
steameis, tugs and ferry-boats swelled
with their hoarse blasts the mighty di
apason of welcome to the new year.
For nearly an hour the din continued
as usual, to the complete extinction of
the Trinity chimes, and then the multi
tude began to gradually float away un
til at 1 o'clock the lower part of the
city was almost deserted.
At the hour the chimes began the I
multitude became so great and so 1
threatening that the captain in charge j
of the police on duty gave orders that
no more sightseers be allowed to walk I
below Cedar-street, and a police line ;
was formed in the fiddle of Broadway
to turn the enormous crowds of horn
blowing humanity down the side
streets. ,
Four hundred policemen, half a dozen
captains and a number of sergeants,
roundsmen and numerous detectives
were on hand, and as the crowds
marched dGÃroadway, expecting to
halt in front of Old Trinity, they were
turned aside and forced to go down
Wall street.
The crowds in upper Broadway were
also unprecedented and 600 policemen
were specially detailed In the tender
loin to keep the great pushing, crowd
ing throng moving along,
HIS FUN COSTS
MONTH'S WAGES
Edward M. Boland, a Clerk
Employed by Electricity
Board, Waylaid and Bobbed
THIEVES USE SANDBAG
Man Is Found Unconscious
by Detective Cornelius,
With Coin and Watch Gone
A New Tear's over-indulgence In
liquor, which was taken advantage of
by footpads, cost Edward M. Boland
his month's wages last night and land
ed him in the hospital.
Boland is a clerk employed by the
Board of Electricity. He was held up
and robbed some time before 7 o'clock
and was found unconscious on Locust
avenue, near Polk street, by Detective
Cornelius of the City Hall station.
Cornelius had the man conveyed to
the Central Emergency Hospital, where
he soon recovered consciousness. He
had been drinking, as his condition at
tested. His watch and $80 were gone
and a broken end of the watch chain
was hanging to the vest.
Dr. Glover, who attended the Injured
man, gave his opinion that Boland was
felled with some blunt instrument, pre
sumably a sandbag. A deep laceration
of the scalp and a possible fracture
comprised the injuries,. Unless compli
cations set in the patient will recover.
Boland's condition was such that he
could only tell a disconnected story,
saying that he had quit work yester
day noon and was paid his month's
wages, $90. He visited several saloons,
after which he wandered into Locust
avenue, and aside from being cognisant
of the fact that something hit him he
remembers nothing.
Detectives were detailed on the case,
but up to a late hour had found no
clew to Boland's assailants. Boland
lives at 451 Tenth street with his par-
SCOITISH THISTLE CLUB
WELCOMES NEW YEAR
Hogmanay supper and Ball Delights
Relatives and Friends of
the Members.
"A quid New Year to am and a' "
was the sentiment universal at the
twenty-third annual hogmanay sup
per and ball of the Scottish Thistle
Club held last night at Lyric Hall.
From the time the doors were
thrown open sorts and daughters of
the highlands and lowlands thronged
to the hall, gathered about the festal
board and enjoyed the dancing that
lasted till early morning. During the
supper toasts to "The President,"
"The King," "The Land We Live In,"
"The Land o' Cak/s," and like senti
ments were responded to by M. S.
Morrison, Mrs. Brindle, Fred Everett,
Mrs. J. H. McGregor and C. H. Biggs.
The committee in charge of the
dancing comprised James Firth, R.
Rintoul, James Robertson, James
Merriman, W. McGregor. F. Fitzger
ald, W. Campbell and Edward Ross.
Nationals Have a Jinks,
Batteries B and C of the First Bat
talion of Artillery (the Nationals), N.
G. C, had a double celebration in the
Ellis-street armory last evening. The
first and the most important of these
to the members of the two batteries
was the burning of the mortgage
which was on the property since the
building was erected and which was
recently canceled. The second was
3eeing the old year out and welcom
ing the new one.
There was a jinks, which was
opened shortly after the burning of
the mortgage with due ceremony. The
programme for the entertainment of
the members', those of Batteries D and
E and the signal corps of the Second
Brigade, was made up of songs, music
and stories and several boxing bouts.
The contributors were the artillery
band, Professor Mansfield's mandolin
club, Fred Giannini, Comedian New
man, J. H. Ed Healy and L..
Sachs. Among the boxers were Bat
tling Nelson and Eddie Stone.
When the clock announced the hour
of 12 the merrymakers gave 1905 a
rousing welcome.
The affair was under the direction
of H. I. Orth, W. H. Mallett, Fred
Hooper, August Wambold and Ed
Martin.
AUTOMOBILE TANK EXPLODES
AND THEATER IS THREATENED
Blaze Is Qulokly Extinguished and No
One Is Hurt âPanic Narrowly
Avoided.
A gasoline tank in an automobile
t-tanding in the Central Park Automo
bile and Garage Company's establish
ment on Market street, near Eighth,
exploded last night and for a moment
the blazing gasoline threatened, to
spread to the huge building which
adjoins the Central Theater.
The blaze was promptly extin
guished, but not before an alarm was
rung in. Much excitement was caused
in the theater when it was letrned
there was a fire next door. The ex
citement was quelled before any harm
was done. No one was hurt by the
explosion.
Ladies' Auxiliary Entertains.
The Ladies' Auxiliary to California
Commandery, Knights Templar, had a
most delightful party in the assembly
hall of the Pioneer building last night,
given by the ladies to the husbands
who, during the year, are not permit
ted to attend the monthly sessions of
the auxiliary. It was a full dress
function that was enjoyed by a very
large number of persons and during
the evening there was dancing in the
main hall and progressive whist in the.
ladies' parlor. The games were under
the direction of William Fletcher and
Mrs. Logan, while the dancing was
directed by Messrs. W. P. Humphries
and S. Clarke. The whole was under
the immediate supervision of Vice
President Mrs. Crowley and all the
officers of the auxiliary.
During intermission a delicate col
lation was served to all and six prizes,
three for ladles and a like number for
gentlemen, were distributed to win-

WOULD UPSET
COURT DECREE
Legality of Proceedings in
the Dunsmuir Will Case
to Be Contested Here
FORMAL NOTICE GIVEN
Advisers of Edna Wallace
Hopper Question Juris
diction of Probate Court
Edna Wallace Hopper, through her
attorneys, Campbell, Metson & Camp
bell, has taken the first step toward
having the contest over the will of the
late Alexander Dunsmuir transferred
from the British Columbia courts to
the Superior Court of this State. Yes
terday her lawyers served formal no
tice on N. P. Luxton, Andrew Thome
and Messrs. Wilson & Wilson, attor*
neys and agents of James Dunsmuir,
executor of the estate of Alexander
Dunsmuir, that on Friday next the
contestants will appear before the Su
perior Court and move that the de
cree of May 9, 1900, admitting the
will of the late Alexander Duns
muir to probate on letters of ad
ministration of James Dunsmuir be
declared void on the grounds that the
court was without jurisdiction to grant
that decree.
The contestants in the notice filed
yesterday claim that at the time of
making the decree the court did not
obtain Jurisdiction of any of the per
sons interested in the estate nor Juris
diction to enter any orders binding
upon the estate or upon them. In
proof of this claim the
will submit the documentary evid.
on file and copies of tie laws of
State bearing on probate proceedings.
It is asserted by prominent lawyers to
whom the legal points upon which
the contestants base their contention
have been submitted that the laws of
the State were violated and that the
young actress has a splendid chance
of upsetting the entire proceeding or
the Victoria court and of eventually
winning her case.
According to the claims of Miss
Hopper's local attorneys, who are act
ing in harmony with Sir Charles Hib
bert Tupper, legal advisor of Mrs. Joan
Dunsmuir, mother of the late Alex
ander Dunsmuir and his brother,
James Dunsmuir, against whom thÂ«
attack on the will is made, and Judge
Edward P. Coyne. Miss Hopper's per
sonal representative, the entire pro
bate proceedings in the Superior Court
here were invalid, in that the laws of
California were not fully complied
with. It will be shown that the laws
of California provide methods for
settling foreign and domestic wills and
that Alexander Dunsmuir, having been
resident of California, his brother pro
ceeded here under the law covering
domestic wills and then took the mat
ter to the Victoria courts, where he
ignored a requirement of the Cali
fornia laws in failing to have witnesses
sworn,relative to the execution of the
will of his brother. It will be shown
that the witnesses were never sworn
in this State. In Victoria the will was
proved under what is known as th'Â»
"common form" of procedure, which
only requires an affidavit as to th*
genuineness of the testator's signature
and a signed statement as to his
death.
As appears in the papers filed, the
contention is that the will of Alex*
ander Dunsmuir has never been prop
erly proved and that the local court
had, therefore, no authority to grant
letters of administration on the show
ing made by the petitioner.

NIGRETTE RUNS THIRD IN HANDICAP
Muddy Going Suits Venator and
He Defeats Judge With
Something to Spare.
Vigoroso First at Long Odds
By finishing third to Venator and
J ;dge in the seven-furlong handicap at
Oakland yesterday Nigrette saddened
her followers. Prince Brutus then won
the last race of the old year, which
brightened up the gloom somewhat.
The card wore an easy look, at
.; ti ling the usual large Saturday
crowd, but it proved as deceptive a
one to beat as Oril Overall's benders
are to bat beyond the baseball lot
ier.ce. The only other winning public
c hoice besides Prince Brutus was Bell
Reed. Vigoroso, Melar and Wenrick
were the long-shot artists.
So rosy did the chances of Nigrette
look for the seven-furlong handicap,
with 105 pounds and "Big Bill" Knapp
up, that her odds were forced from 7 to
5 to 9 to 10. Despite fairly good racing
luck the black mare did not appear at
her best, finishing an ordinary third.
Venator, the second choice, picking up
106 pounds and superbly ridden by
Travers. downed Judge at the wire
with consummate ease by three lengths
in I:2B\*.
KNAPP LANDS MF.LAH FIRST.
Willie Davis rode Baker, the 9 to 10
favorite for the Futurity course two
year-old dash which opened the racing,
and was led out by Melar, a 12 to 1
shot, ridden by Knapp. Possibly Bob
Mitchell would have won had he got
away from the barrier better. As
it was. he shot to the front, leading
the stretch. Then he tired
and Melar. assuming the lead, won by
less than a length from the first
choice. .\!"Â£rregor lost the show to Rob
ert Mitchell by several lengths.

ALL Ol Ft SOLDIERS
TO BE RIFLE EXPERTS
Plana to Remedy n Great Defect
in Our Military
System.
Throughout Elihu Root's long ser
as Secretary of War the one Â«b
-jeci which received his most serious
attention, aside from the operations
of the army in the field, the army re
ranlsatlon act, the general staff
â s< heme and the national militia pro
ji ct, was the question of developing
in the mass of American citizens a
b< dy of trained rniemen large enough
(o make our defenses secure in time
ol war. In season and out of season
he insisted that the country needed
men who could shoot straight, who
KfTew the use of the rifle thoroughly
and with whom proficiency in small
arms practice should be the first test
of fitness as soldiers. Mr. Root's
earnestness in vhis matter served as a
reminder that whereas we have made
but little real progress in rifle shooting
since the days of the Spanish war,
other countries are giving close atten
tion to the subject, Canada alone hav
ing but recently instituted a broad
gauge scheme which it is believed will
produce 500,000 trained riflemen with
in ten years.
owing partly to Mr. Root's persist
ent urging, supported by many other
interested gentlemen in the army, the
navy, the Marine Corps, the National
Ouard and civil life, public interest in
the subject took form in the organi
zation of the national board for the
promotion of rifle practice in the
United States, and as a result of that
movement plans have ben formulated
which if carried into effect seem like
ly to transform millions of hardy
young Americans into expert riflemen
and thus correct what is palpably the
gravest defect In our military system.
In preparing these plans careful
consideration was given to the meth
ods employed by other countries to en
courage rifle shooting among their
cltzens and the paramount purpose
was to devise a system which should
â¢make every American between the
ages of 15 and 25 years ambitious to
become a master marksman. In Its
general scope the scheme provides for
a' highly organized system to encour
age rifle practice in the State militia,
in military and other schools and
among individuals who would be liable
to military service in time of war.â

SANDBANK THE CAUSE
OF WAR PREPARATIONS
Boundary Dispute Between Honduras
Beteen the republics trf Honduras and
Nicaragua are a river, a boundary line
and a dispute. Like most such differ
ences, this one has been up, and down
again, from time to time, with little
prospects of serious trouble or a final
settlement before duties- and taxes to
be gathered ln the territory In dispute
shall have become great enough to pay
for fussing over the matter.
About the year 1889 Nicaraguan offi
cials served notice on an American at
the entrance to the Rio Patuca to the
effect that Nicaragua claimed all terri
tory between that river and the Rio
Coco or Uangâa district which in
cludes more than 2,000,000 acres of roll
ing, sunny and grassy plains, on which
stands a forest of yellow pines. A few
years later Nicaragua seemed to mod
ify her pretensions so that they covered
only about half so much as she claimed
before. Now she seems to have aban
doned all claim to any land north of
the Coco, other than that delta which
lies between the main channel of the
Tang or Coco and that snag-infested
shallow outlet which is on the north
and west side of that sandbank.
Half a century ago that Islet was the
site of a mahogany cutter's camp and a
large village of Waikas or Mosquito In
dians. Then It was left to become a
thicket of mangrove and of coco-plum
bushes, a refuge for egrets, pelicans
and such tomagras as were by floods
drowned out and brought down the
river to become food for such pigs and
sharks as delight in a dinner of ser
pents as venomous, almost, as a rattle
snake.
Within a month a story came that
Honduras was about to send her army
to take possession of the sandbank in
dispute. It has now seme prospective
value, as it may become the site of a
port of entry to a broad and beautiful
plain, beyond which are ranges of
rounded hills which ln some places
might be called mountains, although
many are only 1000 to 2000 feet ln
height.
On the Nicaraguan side of the Coco
are low mountains exceedingly rich in
gold, and covered by forests ln which
are many mahoganies and cedars. On
the Honduras side are few, if any, gold
deposits, but there are good agricul
tural lands, and toward the interior are
considerable forests in which are fine
woods which will be taken out in due
time.
Honduras Is safe in pressing her de
mand now, for the Zelaya administra
tion is on the very thin crust of a vol
cano, ready to explode and bury the
Government ln a burning flood of hate
and vengeance.âNew York Commer
cial.
Dresden Steam Heating Plant.
The steam heating and electric
lighting combination now being
tested by Dresden promises to open
a new era in municipal economy. A
huge central station of the Saxon
Government contains ten generators,
producing 66,000 pounds of steam per
hour, and this is distributed through
street mains to the Royal Opera
house, the Picture Gallery, the Zwln
ger Museum, the Royal Palace and
other buildings. After the morning
heating little steam Is needed to keep
up the* temperature, so that most of
the supply can be used for generat
ing electricity for lighting and other
purposes during the latter part of the
day.âBaltimore American.
Iron Ring From Human Blood.
"Iron in the blood" expresses, no
doubt, a chemical fact as well as a
figure of speech, but probably not one
ln a thousand, even among chemists,
ever saw ferrum sanguinis materialized
to visible metal. This feat, however,
has been performed by M. Barruel,
head of the chemical laboratories of
Paris. M. Barruel, who has, in his
time, practiced much phlebotomy on the
human subject, has systematically ex
tracted chemically the ferrum from the
other constituents. This he transform
ed into minute globules or "pearls" of
iron. At last the idea occurred to him
to have them all welded together and
the result Is an Iron ring made from
human blood, which he wears on his
finger.âLondon Globe.

CORRIGAN SECURES CONTROL
OF HAWTHORNE RACE TRACK
Buys the Interest of Richard Fits-
gcrald and Prepare* to Fight
Western Jockey Clnb.
CHICAGO, Dec. 31.âEdward Cor
rigan has secured control of the Haw
thorne race track. The deal was
closed to-night, when Richard Fitz
gerald, who for a long time has been
thâ¬> principal stockholder ln the track,
sold out his Interest to Corrlgan. The
change of ownership means, it Is said,
that the Western Jockey Club will
have a fight on Its hands if some ac
tion is not taken at its regular month
ly meeting January 3 to revise the rac
ing dates for 1906 picked out for the
different tracks throughout the West
and South at the annual meeting early
in December. Corrlgan now has full
control of the new track at New Or
leans and the probabilities are that
he will also get control of the Kansas
City track. The control of these two
tracks, together with Hawthorne,
makes Corrlgan one of the strongest
leaders of racing in the West. Allied
with Corrlgan will be found several of
tht* other smaller tracks of the West
and Southwest, including Essex Park
at Hot Springs, Ark.

MISS CROCKER
WINS TROPHY
Miss Van Vliet Sustains
Her First Defeat on the
Public Tennis Courts
VICTOR IS PROMISING
Janes Defeats Collkr in
a Well-Played Match of
Continuous Tournament
There was some spirited play yester
day on the tennis courts. On the Gold
en Gate Park courts the ladies finished
their handicap singles tournament for
Cochrane cup. This event was started
earlier in the week and was completed
to the finals la one half and to the
semi-finals ha the other. The first match
yesterday was between Miss Sarita Van
Vliet, who "owed 15 3-6," and Miss
Gold a Myer, playing from scratch- As
the score shows, the handicap was
about right- * Miss Van Vliet won two
sets out of three, the score being 6-3,
6-7, %-Z.
Miss Van Vliet met Miss Vera Crock
er in the finals, and the handicap was
the same as in the preceding match.
Miss Van VMet did her best to Win, *nit
her opponent proved too clever and
took the first and third sets quite hand
ily. Miss Van Vliet won the second set
easily. The score, in Miss Crocker's
favor, was 6-3, 2-6, 6-1.
This is the first time Miss Van Vliet
has been beaten in a ladies' tourna
ment. She won the cup the last time it
was played for, but she was asked to
gtve larger odds yesterday. Miss Crock
er is a clever young; player who will be
heard from in the future.
On the California Club courts two
continuous tournament matches were
flayed and many good practice games.
former were the closest the tour
nament has as yet brought out.
Geo. r ge Janes, who is No. 1 man, met
and d&.'eated W. B. Collier, No. 2, in
one of tlie closest and most stubbornly
contested matches seen on the club
courts in nymths. All three sets were
close, the secYnd going to 13-11. Collier
won the first wet by a 7-5 score, and
had many chances to annex the second.
After twenty-four games had been
played, in which flrct one player was
ahead and then the or"?er, Janes finally
got two games ahead ai;d won. Collier
tried his hardest to win ri" out In the
third set, but his younger opponent
stood the strain better and Won by a
6-4 score.
Thia is Janes' second victory pver
Collier ln the tournament. The winner
has been remarkably successful sine*
he joined the club. He has not been beat
en In a tournament as yet. This is not
the fin-' time he has had a close call,
but he usually manages to come out on
the long end. Many of his opponents
consider him lucky. This is true, but
he has something besides luck.
The other tournament match was also
close. It required three sets, the short
est of which was 6-4. The contestants
were Harold Gabriel and Al Kenyon.
Gabriel won the second and third sets
after losing the first. The score was
5-7, 6-4, 7-5.
The following practice matches were
played: Herbert Schmidt and Harry
Rolfe beat B. F. Nourse and Carl Gard
ner, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4; Schmidt beat Rolfe,
6-2; Sumner Hardy and Schmidt beat
Sam Hardy and Dr. Hill, 10-8; Sam
Hardy and Hill beat Sumner Hardy
and Dr. McChesney, 6-0; George Janes
and Al Kenyon tied J. S. Tobln and ML
Long, 2-6, 7-5; Llsser brothers beat
Thome and Lund, 6-2; Dr. Younger and
Dr. Philip tied M. "Warner and Nourse,
6-4. 6-7; W. Johnson and G. Cutter beat
Lund and Thorne, 6-2, 6-3, 6-8.

reason Cornell and Spllvalo were put
in the second class Instead of the first.
In the first class Collier and Janes
are the strongest players. J, 8. Tobin
has entered, but can hardly last
through the tournament. Schmidt has
had but little practice of late, but
stands a good chance to win. OardneÂ»
is another player who should not be
overlooked.
With Cornell and Spllvalo In the
second class the other four entries do
not look to have much chance. M.
Long may make Cornell work, but the
latter should win the class.
In the third class there are also
six entries. Kenyon looks by far the
best man ln the class. He would not
be out of place in the second class.

PIITATM ACTRESS FLAUNTS
fflffl SARCASM IN COURT
Bfe Prefers "SfieecawQo" to "Frisco"
Eastern Police Addicted to Old-Time Gallantry
â Miss May Watson Informed Police
Judge Mogan that a very brief stay in
San Francisco had sufficed to Inspire
her with yearning to go elsewhereâ
eastward preferred.
"Frisco's a lovely city, I don't think,"
she said, with fine sarcasm. "Sheecaw
go, where I was horn and raised, is
so far behind the times that the police
never think of arresting ladies and
charging them with vagrancy. It takes
one to come 'way out here to learn
what's up-to-date. Poor old Sheecawgo
is bo awful backward, I'm sure, not."
Patrolman J. F. Bruce remarked that
when he interrogated Miss Watson at
Sixth and Howard streets, preliminary
to arresting her, she told, him, among
other things, that she was a daughter
of Missouri. *
"Smart chap this," the defendant re
joined, winking at the bench and al
luding to the officer. "If he has an
other think coming I wish you'd tip
him to remember that I didn't tell him
that at all. When he threatened to run
me in I asked him what for, and he
said for vagrancy, and I said, 'Well,
I'm from Missouri, and you must show
me.' Another thing the Sheecawgo po
lice do is to try to tell the truthâbut
they are such back numbers, ye know."
Then the Judge asked Miss Watson
to state her age, and when she replied
"thirty." he looked at her incredulously
and said, "Is that all?"
"All?" she hissed. "All? Ain't that
enough? I'm sure if I had even sus
pected you thought I was more than
thirty I'd a-tacked on a few more
years. I'm awfully obliging that way."
"You appear to be at least fifty," said
his Honor, with brutal candor.
"Hee, hee, d'ye really think so? My,
â¢how did you guess so closely? I've
.never heard of a Sheecawgo Judge ask
ing a lady her ageâbut the Sheecawgo
Judges are so stupid, ye y Tcnow."
Miss Watson, with frequent ironical
digressions to Sheecawgo, averred that
she lived at 136 Howard street with her
husband, an actor, and that she, too,
was a stage artist, but "resting."
"In poor, old-fashioned Sheecawgo,"
she concluded, "actresses are not rated
as vagrants."
Che was remanded for further in
quiry, the Judge promising that if her
pleaÂ» was only half-confirmed he would
permit her to return to "Sheecawgo."

There were four distinct charges of
swindling against David de Costa.
.Judge Conlan pronounced him guilty
on each and sentenced him to one
year's imprisonment.
Mr. de Costa's game was to engage
'a room in a lodging-house and tender
in payment of one week's advance
rental a $20 Confederate bill. If the
landlady accepted the bill and gave
'him whatever change was due he pock
eted it and departed, to return no
.more; but if she detected the worthless
ness of the paper he feigned both sur
prise and grief and declared he had
been taken in and done for by some
imaginary person who had given him
the scrip. When arrested he hid suc

Hortense Powers of 1232 Octavla street

him. His accomplice, one Roy Gorlane,
is held for sentence.

Tjehalf of lone Moore, convicted of shop

the latter's arrest. The hearing was
continued for thirty days.

Soon after Jeremiah Donovan's ar
rest for drunkenness and disturbing
the peace he was released on ball and
advised to abstain from absorbing
toxicants until his case was disposed
of by Judge Conlan. He not only ig
nored the counsel, but conveyed into
court a huge and ferocious-aiypearing
dog in addition to a thoroughly ma
tured "jag." When he was called to
the bench the canine accompanied
hfm, and the Judge at, once ordered
the man's incarceration and the
quadruped's removal. The two bailiffs
found it no difficult task to obey the
order as to the man, for he was inebri
ated unto helplessness, but the dog's
ejection was easier of suggestion than
accomplishment. The brute took ref
uge under the attorneys' table and
growlingly dared any person to lay so
much as one finger upon him. Bailiff
Laws advanced boldly to his duty, but
war, driven back by a dental display
and an angry snarl that prompted quite
a number of prildent masculine "behold-
ers to clamber upon chairs and several
women hurriedly to hasten doorward.
"Remove that dog," commanded his
Honor, "and let us have order in
court."
Again the bailiffs, reinforced by a
valiant policeman, endeavored to obey
the mandate, and again the glistening
fangs and the gutteral danger signal
stopped them. Then they tried per
suasion. They chirruped and snapped
their fingers and patted their knees
and whistled and coaxingly said "Good
doggieâcomeâthat's a nice doggie,"
but the beast merely smiled through
his snarl and blinked his red eyes and
moved not one inch from his defensive
position.
The situation was becoming* quite

Judge Mogan dismissed eleven com
plaints in which the charge was pool
selling and again chided the police for
bringing such cases into his court
without sufficient evidence to warrant
conviction. The defendants were
cigar dealers and on the premises of
each of them were found "entry
sheets" and blank tickets such as are,
used when bets are made. But there
was no evidence that any bets had
been made.

A. Li. Bratten, an employe of the

prosecute Matt Sweeney, a bellboy,
who was arrested for stealing- some
clothing- from that gentleman's apart*

Mogan held that Mr. Bratten's show
of mercy was ill-advised, inasmuch as>
pilfering by bellboys had become so
common that the sending of the de
fendant to jail might have a deterrent
effect on whatever larcenous proclivi

decided to give Master Sweeney arts
other chance to elude the prison taint.

His Fortune and That of

less and Without Funds
NEW YORK, Dec. 31.âDr. Leroy S.
Chadwick, husband of Mrs. Cassie L.
Chidwick, arrived, in this country to
day on the steamship Pretoria, ran the
gauntlet of big crowds which had wait
ed for hours to see him, was taken to
the Hoboken police headquarters and to
the Recorder's Court and finally left
for Cleveland, not as a prisoner, but as
the guest of Sheriff Barry, who had
come from Ohio with a warrant for the
doctors arrest, which he did not serve.
After the trying ordeal of the day Dr.
Chadwick appeared cheerful when he
and Sheriff Barry arrived at the Penn
sylvania station in Jersey City this Aft
ernoon to take the 5:15 train for Cleve
land.
Sheriff Barry had left Dr. Chadwick
and his daughter, Miss Mary Chadwick,
at the hotel in Hoboken while he came
to New York to attend to some busi
ness. The Sheriff'returned to the hotel
eafly in the afternoon and he and Dr.
Chadwick rode to the station in a cab.
During an hour's wait at the station
Dr. Chadwick talked of his travels, but
declined to discuss his wife's troubles
or his own. His daughter remained in
Hoboken and in a few days will go to
Jacksonville, Fla. The doctor's depart
ure was delayed several hours that he
might arrange for Miss Chadwick's trip
to the South.
DAUGHTER IS PENNILESS.
According to an interview with a first
cabin passenger published here to-day,
Miss Mary Chadwick said in the course
of the voyage to America:
"We knew nothing or suspected noth
ing until remittances from home began
to fall short. Now, I have all of my
gowns but none of my money left. I
don't know what it all means. I know
.that father is not to blame. I think
there has been some horrible mistake
that we will be able to clear up when
we get home. I hated to believe that
my mother wrongfully used my money,
although apparently it is all gone."
According to the interview, Dr. Chad
wick had lost $8000 of his money and
several hundred thousand dollars that
belonged to his daughter in her own
right had also disappeared.
DR. CHADWICK'S STATEMENT.
Dr. Chadwick gave the press a long
interview on his arrival. In reply to
questions he said:
"I am inexpressibly shocked by the
recent turn of events. I am inqo'cent
of all charges against me and can
point with pride to a thirty-five years'
residence in Cleveland. I cannot be
lieve that the dreadful things printed
by the papers are true. I am entire
ly without information as to the case
except what I read in the papers and
what you have been good enough to
tell me, so I can say nothing of the
awful charges against my wife. My
life the past few weeks has been a liv
ing death, and I hope no one will ever
go through what I have undergone.
To think that my professional career,
which has always been successful,
should be blighted. My daughter,
Maryâpoor little darling! I love her
as my life. When I recovered from my
illness in Paris my financial resources
made it necessary for me to travel in
the second cabin. I insisted that she
go first class, but the noble girl re
fused and has kept at my side, cheer
ing me in my dark hour of trouble and
proving to me more and more what a
splendid woman she is.
"Oh. this is a dreadful calamity. I
had no idea that such a fate was
mine. I know little of Mrs. Chadwick's
financial affairs, and until I find out
the details will say nothing. I am
overwhelmed by the charges against
her."
GIVES WAY TO TEARS.
Dr. Chadwick read the dispatch
from Cleveland that Mrs. Chadwick
had been measured by the Bertillon
system. As he finished the reading
he groaned aloud and as he turned to
the correspondent, tears rolled down
his cheeks. The doctor, ill and sore
at heart, was completely overwhelmed
by the revelation and the subsequent
developments.
"This is the last straw," he said,
"measuring her in that way. Oh, that
I am brought to this! I knew that I
should find trouble and breakers
ahead, but I never for a moment ex
pected arrest. Guilty? Of course I'm
not guilty. I am absolutely Innocent.
And you say poor old Beckwith %s very
ill? Poor man! I know him but lit
tle, but I am sure he is innocent."
Ther correspondent then told Dr.
Chadwick the statement that has been
made that Mrs. Chadwick is believed
tc be Madame Devere. He fell back
stunned.
"Madame Devere," he cried. "Oh,
no, no; don't say that! That can't be.
I don't believe that such a thing can
bo possible. If she is I have never
suspected it and do not for a moment
believe it."
"Do you think Mrs. Cha'dwick can
be guilty as accused?" was asked.
"I cannot think her* guilty of any
thing. I do not know the charges, but
she cannot be guilty."
HOMELESS AND A PAUPER.
Asked about his financial resources,
he said:
"If what the papers say is true, I am
a pauper. You saw my beautiful home
in Cleveland and you know how I have
lived. Now you see me coming back
in the second cabin âI, who have al
ways traveled by the best ships and'
occupied the best cabins. But if all
that has been said is true I am home
less and without a dollar. Oh, it is hard
for one at my time of life to come to
this. You ask if I am guilty. I have
gald 'No!'
"To make my situation clear I have 1
in contemplation the writing of a book.,
I want physicians, lawyers, clergymen,!
bankers, business men, everybody to
know where I stand. I have written
the skeleton of the book already and
expect to have time to write It. I will
show the world everything.
"You say my wife is accused of be
ing Madame Devere. Did I look into
her history? Think of my position. I
was a widower with an invalid Bister,

MRS. CHADWICK COLLAPSES.
CLEVELAND, 0.. Dec. 31.âWith
tears streaming down her face, while
she wrung her hands in nervous excite
ment, Mrs. Chadwick to-day listened
in the corridor of the County Jail to
the reading of the dispatches telling
of the scenes enacted on board the
steamship Pretoria, incidental to the
taking into custody of her husband,
Dr. Chadwick, by Sheriff Barry. Mrs.
Chadwick was unable to control her
feelings, and interrupted the reading
of the dispatch at almost every word
with some comment.
"Oh, my poor husband," she ex
claimed, between her sobs. "To think
that he must be dragged Into these
terrible charges against me. He is as
Innocent of any wrongdoing as an un
born babe."
When the doctor's statement detail
ing the circumstances under which he
had met and married her was read,
Mrs. Chadwick sprang to her feet, and,
pacing up and down the jail corridor,
shrieked in mental agony until her
cries could be heard through the build
ing.
"It is not true," she cried: "I do not
believe the doctor ever said anything
6f the kind."
For a moment the woman continued
her rapid walk up and down the nar
row confines of the corridor, then she
suddenly stopped, and, throwing: up
her arms, fell to the floor ln a faint.
She was carried to a cot by the jail at
tendants and later became more calm.
Judge Tilden, in the Criminal Court,
to-day fixed the bail of Dr. Chadwick
at $10,000. Attorney Dawley stated
that a bond for that amount probably
would be ready on Dr. Chadwlck's ar
rival here. _j

FLAMES CAUSE
$000,000 LOSS
Fire Starts in Seven-Story
Building in Chicago and
Spreads With Great Speed
CHICAGO, Dec. 31.âA fire that
started to-day on the second floor of
the seven-story brick building in West
"Van Euren street occupied by the Cash
Buyers' Union destroyed property val
ued at $600,000. Spreading rapidly, the
fire soon assumed such large propor
tions that the whole district was in
danger and a second alarm was sent
in, followed by a series of extra calls
for additional men and apparatus.
When the fire penetrated to the ad
joining building, occupied by the Zeno
Manufacturing Company, a four-story
structure, the firemen were ordered to
the roofs of adjacent buildings to fight
the flames. Within a few minutes the
flames had gutted the structure and
spread to the Boston Rubber Paint
Company. Then the flames, cracking
the brick walls of the building, spread
to 1602 West Van Buren street, causing
heavy damage to the Peninsular Stove
Company, which firm occupied the
seven floors. So fierce did the blaze
become that burning sparks, carried by
a high gale, were driven over the dis
trict and building blocks far away
caught fire.
With a detonation that was heard
for squares an explosion in the base
ment ot the Cash Buyers' Union tore
up the streets and sidewalks, throwing
flrymen into the air and knocking the
wires of the Van Buren street electric
car line down. Fred Biocki, a fire
man, was struck on the head by fall
ing bricks and severely injured. Crush
ing down through the walls of the
structure adjoining came the towering
walls of the Peninsular Stove Com
pany, and those of the Cash Buyers'
Union tottered and collapsed.
A series of small explosions followed
the fall of the walls. A two-story
frame dwelling at 1663 West Van Bu
ren street, occupied as a rooming
house, was crushed like a shell by the
falling walls. The inmates had been
awakened earlier and escaped to thÂ»
street, but were unable to save any
of their clothing.
There was a small panic on the Met
ropolitan Railway when the motormen
rushed their cars through the smoke.
Passengers attempted to get out, but
were held in check by the guards.
When the explosion occurred the win
dows in the residences across the street
were shattered and chimneys were
thrown down. Firemen who were in
the path of the falling walls escaped
by leaping into a hole that was
being dug at the east side of a frame
building.
The fire is pronounced by Chief Cam
pion to have made more rapid head
way than any in his experience since
the great fire of 1871.

The Oregon Express
Runs Into Train
on Sidetrack.
DUE TO NEGLECT
Switch Is Left Open
and Disaster
Follows.
BLAME NOT FIXED
Special Dispatch to The Call,
SUISUN, Dec. 31.âA train wreck oc
curred here this morning about 8
o'clock in which Herman L. Peters, an
engineer, lost his life. Several other
persons narrowly escaped a like fate.
Two engines, a mail car, a baggage car
and three flat cars were smashed Into
a heap of scrap iron and splinters.
The wreck was caused by No. 11
train, the Oregon Express, running into
an open switch and crashing into the
engine of a gravel train which was
standing on a side track waiting for
the passenger train to pass.
The gravel train had backed on the
siding about a half hour before, and J.
N. Sheridan, the brakeman who had
charge of the switch, says he closed it
after the train had reached the siding.
Conductor W. G. Brown of the same
train also says that the switch was
closed after his train went upon the
siding, but it was open a few minutes
afterward when the ill-fated train ap
proached it.
Herbert Schroeder, fireman on the
passenger train, says he discovered the
open switch when his train was within
two or three car lengths of it. He told
the engineer and then jumped from the
cab, escaping with a sprained wrist.
Engineer Peters immediately applied
the emergency brakes and jumped
through the cab window. Before he
could get out of the way the crash
came and he was caught under the
wreckage of the mail and baggage car.
His body was crushed to a pulp and
both arms and both legs were frac
tured. He lived but a few minutes, be
ing partly conscious up to the last and
spoke of his wife and baby, who reside
at 941 Willow street, Oakland.
H. B. Charles, express messenger, and
L. C. Atchinson, mall clerk, were ln the
combination mail and express car,
which was completely telescoped, but
escaped with slight injuries.
The coaches remained on the track
and the passengers were treated to a
severe shaking* up, but none of them
received any injuries save a few
scratches and slight bruises.
H. E. Littlejohn, engineer of the
gravel train, together with J. N. Sheri
dan and W. N. Maher, brakeman of the
same train, were in the engine when
they saw the approaching train turn
into the siding about 200 feet away.
They made their escape by jumping.
One of the flat cars was driven
through the wall of the cannery build
ing near the track. Traffic on the main
line was not blocked, the wreckage be
ing on the siding. A wrecking crew
and train arrived from Oakland this
afternoon to clear up the debris. The
engines are almost a total wreck.
An inquest was held here this after
noon by Justice of the Peace E. F.
Biggs of Benicia, acting Coroner, to
investigate the cause of, and fix the re
sponsibility if possible, for the death of
Engineer Peters. Brakeman Shceridan
testified that he had closed the switch
after the gravel train had passed
through it and he was corroborated by
Conductor Brown. The verdict of the
Jury was that Peters came to his death
in a railroad collision caused by an
open switch, and while the accident was
caused by the gross negligence of some
one, the Jury could not from the evi
dence fix the blame upon any particu
lar person.
Engineer Peters was 38 years of ago
and a native of Kentucky.
MOURN PETERS' DEATH.
Unfortunate Engineer Leaves a Young
Wife and Baby in Oakland.
OAKLAND, Dec. 31.âHerman L.
Peters, the Southern Pacific engineer
who was killed at Suisun this morning,

years and was considered one of the
most careful engineers on the local
division.

was received at the West Oakland
yards Master Mechanic Russell or
dered the nag at the roundhouse set
at halfmast as a token of respect to
the dead engineer.

COLUSA. Dec. 81.âThe river at Colu

foot mark, which is only two feet lower
than the highest point reached by the
great floods of last winter. The wing
dam on the south of the recently con
structed Butte Slough weir, which
joins District 70 levee, has washed
out, and there is but little hope of hold
ing the 70 levee. Large trees are now
pouring through the break and the
strain is more than it can possibly
stand. Should this levee go out thou
sands of acres of the richest land in
Sutter County will be covered, and the
damage will reach into the thousands.
A gopher hole In the levee near Co

was discovered in the nick of time to
prevent what would surely have been
a break.
The Bartlett Springs staff* waa awept
to destruction Thursday Afternoon
while attempting to cross Complection
Creek, in Little Indian Valley, twelve
miles from Bartlett Springs. One of
the stage horses was drowned, the mall
bags were lost and the driver, Oeorge
Christy, narrowly escaped drowning in
the angry storm waters of the creek.
The stage left Williams during the
heavy storm Thursday morning, and
though the trip was a disagreeable one
everything went well until Complection
Creek was reached. The storm had
caused the stream to rise higher than
ever before and It was a perfect tor
rent, rushing madly over the bowlders.
It was a dangerous task to attempt to
drive a stage into the angry stream,
but Uncle Sam's mail had to be deliv
ered. Into the water the horses were
forced, and they had scarcely gone the
length of the stage when they were
thrown from their feet by the rushing
current. Instantly the driver, horses
and all were floundering in the waters.
The stage washed loose from the team,
not, however, before one of the animals
was drowned. The remainder of the
team finally made the shore, but It waa
with great difficulty that the driver,
more dead than alive, finally reached
the bank. The stage was washed more
than 200 yards down stream and
wrecked. The mail bags were never
seen after the stage went over. Another
stage owned by the same company was
almost wrecked trying to cross Bear
Creek on its regular run to Sulphur
Creek, but the driver, seeing that it
would have been folly to have attempt
ed to cross the stream, returned to Wil
liams, j
