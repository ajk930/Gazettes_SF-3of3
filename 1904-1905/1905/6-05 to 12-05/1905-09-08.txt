Home Affairs Destroyed.
TOKIO. BÂ«pt. 7.â Serions rioting' fol
lowed the attack on Tuesday upon the
office of the Kckumin Shimbun, the Gov
ernment organ. A mob attacked and
burned the official residence of the Min
ister of Home Affairs, which stood be
tween the Nobles Club and the Imperial
Hotel and fated Hibiya Park, which was
the etorm center throughout the day.
Threatening , demonstrations occurred In
the neighborhood cf the official homes of
Premier Katsara and Baron Komura, the
foreign Minister, who is now in ' the
United States, 'but the police succeeded in
preventing injury to the occupants or
damage to the- dwellings.
The destruction of the home mission
residence , was intensely dramatic
Throughout the day a series of demon
strations occurred in the neighborhood of
the; building and late in the afternoon
the mob attacked. the house, swept away
the police and battered down the gates.
The. police and" servants resisted stoutly,
but the. mob surged forward and entered.
One of the leaders, carrying an armful
of burning straw, gained the rear of the
structure and succeeded in setting ' It " on
fixe. The police .reserves charged the
crowds, using their gwonJs freely, but- the
mob rallied f rom .; several quarters and
Btor.ed the 2 firemen when they" arrived.
The members of the Minister's household
were rescued and escorted "to the Imperial
Hotel. When : darknesa came the flames
The San Francisco Call.
from the burning building illuminated a
menacing scene, the mob hooting, and
throwing stones at the police . and fire
men, who repeatedly cleared the streets.
Accurate fisrures. of the casualties are
not obtainable. It is .known,' however,
that one . man was . killed, that , fourteen
were mortally wounded by sword-thrusts
and that many persons- were bruised with
stones and injured in: the crushes.
Another demonstration, is planned for
September S and It is believed that- the
strongest measures will be necessary to
prevent serious rioting and bloodshed.

E>ur!Â»Â£ the evening detachmenta of;lm

parts of the city to assist in protecting

Blockades were established around â¢ tho
buildings and the public was excluded.
Street car traffic was' suspended in the
troublesome districts on account ..of .in
ability' to move the cars.
The only serious disturbance on Wednes
day morning was the partial wrecking of
a printing office which was assisting the
Kokumin Shinibun to publish its editions.
The crowd attempted to 'enter the build
ing, but was prevented \u25a0'. by soldiers./and
some fighting resulted.* The police were
withdrawn- and kept in the background,
on account of popular disfavor. 'The sol
diery and gendarmes are performing gen
eral duty, the soldiers guarding the for
eign legations. Apparently, there, is an
outbreak of anti-foreign sentiment, but
the Government is anxious to prevent "the
injury of members of the legation and
other foreigners. A few foreigners have
been caught by the mobs and roughly
used.
Throughout Wednesday the'offlce" of the
Kokumin Shimbun continued to be â¢ be-;

Washington Takes Serious

Special Dispatch to The Call.
CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON. Sept. 7. â Unofficial ad
vices from Japan have ' caused the
greatest anxiety at the State Depart
ment. At least they are officially
termed "unofficial advices."' but they
relate to the disturbances in that coun
try which have followed the publica
tion of the treaty of Portsmouth and
to the attitude which the Japanese
people have in consequence assumed
toward American tourists and others.
Apparently the common people of
Japan hold the United States respon
sible for the terms of the treaty and
for their own interpretation of that
contract, which seems to be that Rus
sia has won all the substantial fruits
of a long and costly war and the Jap
anese have finally submitted to a dis
honorable peace. The State Depart
ment, of course, does not discuss the
accuracy of that impression, but it is
vitally concerned for the safety of
thousands of Americans who are now
in that country either as tourists or
resident representatives of mercantile
interests. There are likewise the mis
sionaries.
Not only is this the season when
Americans \-isit .Japan as tourists, but
the interest in that country from an
American standpoint has increased a
thousand fold because of the war. Per
sons who ordinarily would have gone
the Cook or Baedeker route of Europe
have heen attracted to the island em
pire of the Pacific because of the
prominence into which it has been
brought by its struggle against the
Muscovite empire and these persons in
particular are threatened with the feel
ing:, which according to to-day's dis
patches was displayed in the stoning of
the Harriman party.
The Harriman party, which arrived
in Tokio last Saturday, is composed of ,
E. H. Harriman. president of the
Southern Pacific, and his family; R. P.
Schwerin, vice president of the Pacific

The particular significance of the
unpleasant episode is that while they
were stoned while in the company of
Marquis Ito they were the personal
guests of Minister Griscom and his
wife and for that reason if nx> other
they should have been Immune from
material expressions of sentiment by
the Tokio rabble. . An elaborate pro
gramme of entertainment by promi
nent officials of the Japanese Govern
ment had been arranged for them, but
In view of the day's events it Is likely
to be called off.
A still more important consideration
to the department is that Secretary
Taft and his party, and later on, Miss
Alice Roosevelt, will have to touch at'
Japanese ports on their return to this
country from their trip to the Philip
pines and China. While they were en
route to Maniia they were entertained
in a most cordial manne; in Japan, but
unless the sentiment in that "country
changes materially in the next two
weeks it seems most probable that '
they, too. will be open to indignities
that would be liable to open an inter
national difference. It would not be
surprising here if Japan were cut out
of the returning: itinerary of both
branches of the party.
It is expected at the State Depart
ment that an apology will be made by
the Government of Japan for the Har
riman episode, but at the same time It
â¢would be absurd to believe that even
with apologies the former state *\u25a0 of.

RECEIVES TEXT
OF DECISION
WASHINGTON, Sept. 7.â The State De
partment was to-day placed in the posses
sion of the full text of the recent decision
of the Venezuelan Court of last Instance
confirming the Judgment of the same
court sitting as a tribunal of the -first
instance in the case of the Venezuelan
Government against the New York and
Bermudese Asphalt Company for the non
fulfillment of contract obligations by the
asphalt company. ! The decision was
transmuted through the Venezuelan le
gation here and laid before Acting Secre
tary of State Loomis by Senator N. Golti
coa, Venezuelan Charge d* Affaires.
The effect of the decision, to rescind the
company's contract and condemn it to
pay the <:osts of the suit, was cabled, on
the date on which it was rendered, Aug-'
ust 7 last. The document ' presented to
day-gives, besides the decision, a brief
history of the litigation and the evidence
and argument of either side to "the con
troversy. When the suit was Instituted
a receiver was placed in charge of the
property and it is understood this ar
rangement continues. The case, is dis
tinct from a second suit brought by the
Government against the cotnpany seeking
damages on the charge that the company,
instituted a. revolutionary movement.
The contract which the decision rescinds
was executed in 18S3 and the clause which
was the cause of the suit required the
dredging of the navigable streams of
Bermudese by the company. The fact
that this dredging was not done the court
finds to have been established, notwith
standing the showing to the contrary
sought to be- made by the. defendant
company. The company in its argument
in the case sets up the claim that Its
title to the property waa not based on
the contract in question. It alleges that
the terms of this contract were fulfilled,
however, and if they had not been the
company was not 'limited, by the terms
of the contract to any period of time in
which its terms might- bÂ« 4 compiled with.
Finally the company argued that the
stipulation to dredge the rivers never
legally existed, and, if It did, was covered
by an alternative proposition, which was
to construct a railroad,, and" that the al
terriative proposition had been met. This
argument Is answered by the court In
this language:
"The non-fulfillment- of the contract on
the part of the company Is fully proved in
these proceedings." , .. '. \u25a0

to propose a toast "to the health of the

Joseph Gafney was 23 years. old and an

lived in Cripple Creek., five â¢or six ; years
and -worked in the-. Isabella mine . two
years. He went /.to Tonopah / from .- San

The mystery surrounding the tragedjMs
Increased by bits -.off information that
have reached here on several occasions.
While here - two weeks' ago . a; man ; from

Gafney had. better look .after his broth

brother that Joseph had been absent. from
Tonopah three weeks J and that his. per
sonal: effects were in; the hotel. Failure
to take his belongings seems to dispose of
the theory that the young man was'en
gaged in prospecting â¢ when he lost ; his

situation, and this belief probably, fur
\u25a0 nished the inspiration for the imperial or
der to the Viceroy of the Caucasus to stop
the disorders at all costs.
The town of Baku lies in a steep, walled
amphitheater . on the southern shore of
the Apsheron Peninsula, with the " oil
fields on either side, from which pipa
lines convey the oil a few miles to the
.refineries In the town. ' Most of these
refineries are- located in the so-called
"black town"" quarter. The principal of
Balahkan } oil fields, where the ; heaviest
fighting ''has taken place, Is fifteen miles
northeast of Baku./ Sabunto . and Ro
manix are adjoining districts. Bibiebat,
a small but very rich field, lies on the
opposite or west side of Baku, just out
side the city limits. Most of the sur
rounding region Is inhabited by* Tartar
hill tribes, who, in addition, to occupying
the two districts on the hillsides running
down to the por^, also occupy the old
fortified section in the center of the town,
which is probably their headquarters.
The Tartar quarters are composed of
dirty and . squalid houses' in. crooked
streets. Many of the streets are scarcely
wide enough to permit two persons to
pass.

C. B. Holbrook of this city, secretary
ef the Bodetr for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Animals, is lying at the point
cf death at his home on Bray avenue In
Fruitvale as the result of an automobile
accident. Faulty steering gear, which
west wrong at a critical moment while
the machine was rounding a curve near
the old Morosco place on the Redwood
rcafi. Fruitvale, caused the accident, and
that both Holbrook and his companion,
Â«ld automobile dealer named Townsend,
were not kCiled outright is almost a
ttiracle.
Hclbrook was negotiating for the pur
chase cf the machine and the dealer had
taken him for a ride to demonstrate the
Kood points of the auto. After a trip
through Upper Fruitvale Mr. Holbrook
and his companion were returning to the
home of the former, when, while rounding
the curve in the road neer the home of
Harry Bit ho? on the old Slorosco place,*
the steering gear of the automobile re
fused to work, and a moment later the
machine ran into a bank at the side of
the road and -overturned.
Almost as soon as the auto struck the
Kxound the jrasolinc tank exploded and an
Instant later the machine was in flames.
Townsend had jumped from the machine
as It went over and escaped with a num
ber of severe bruises, bui Holbrook was
caught beneath the machine and before
be couid be extricated the flaming gaso
line had ignited his clothing and he was
dragged from beneath the wreck .with
' .iis coat burned completely off.
Unconscious from pain, Holbrook was
placsd in the wagon of a passing farmer
and w as hurriedly driven to his home and
a physician was summoned to attend him.
An examination showed tnat besides be
ing hadly burned by the gasoline Mr. Hol
brook had sustained a fracture of the
right arm and a dislocated shoulder, In
addition to a number of painful cuts and
bruises. It is feared, also, that he has
sustained stri^us internal injuries, as he
has beÂ«?n in a terni-conscious condition
sincd the accident. The injured man is
now under the care of his son-in-law. Dr.
Brantley E. Plymire, and Dr. McNutt of

CITY OF ANGELSS
TO ISSUE BONDS
Special DinMtch to The CalL
LOS ANGELES, Sept. 7. â The propo
sition to vote $1,500,000 of municipal
bonds for the acquisition of a city
water supply from Owens River . in
Inyo County was carried in this city
to-day by an overwhelming majority.
One of the largest votes ever > cast in
the city on any similar project was
volled. The total vote was 11,447 â
: 0.653 for and 754 against. The total
registered vote of the city is about
I'S.vOO, but it is seldom that so large
a vote is polled on a bond proposition
as that recorded to-day.
The result of to-day's vote means
that the city will proceed with the
acquisition of water . rights in the
Owens Valley and with the preliminary
surveys for the building of the long
conduit to carry the water to this city.,
The distance from the headwaters of
the Owens River to Los Angeles is
about 240 miles. The entire proposition
Is estimated by experts* to cost about
12 1.509,000 and will require from three
to four years to complete.
Work on the surveying of the route
\u2666or the conduit will commence as soon
as the bonds are placed on the mar
ket, which is anticipated will be with
in a couple of weeks.

Merchants Hold a Confer

f rain From Boycotting
Goods From United States
AMOY, â¢_ Sept. 7. â The transport Logan.:
with, Major General, Corbin. and party on
board, arrived here this morning at,day
break. Many of the party.went on shore
and viewed the scenes of the recent tiots.
The present condition "of "affairs in con
nection with the anti-American boycott
movement is uncertain f and the coolies
are expected to make a serious outbreak
on crj about September 13. \u25a0
All the members of the party are re
ported .well on board the Logan,; which
sailed for Shanghai ut ; o'clock this
afternoon. . -\u25a0â¢<\u25a0" Â».::.
The Chinese gunboat Hslr.g Hang ap
peared before the American Consulate
on the ' water â¢;\u25a0 front yesterday ?; with the
American flag , at . i ts masthead and fired'
a salute of : twenty-one guns, as amends
for an act' of an insulting nature com
mitted in connection with the flagpole of
the consulate about two weeks ago.
The whole affair grew out : of the anti-
American boycott agitation.' There area
large number of merchants in Amoy who
have business connection in Manila.
Many of the merchants have had dif
ficulties in /getting into the "Philippines
since the American occupation and as a
result the feeling against Americans: in
Amoy is very bitter. ;
The boycott agitation In the city took
definite form about the 16th of July, when
the jhirty-slx merchants composing Hhe
Amoy \u25a0Chamber of Commerce ;met and
signed an agreement to buy no more
American goods until the exclusion law
was modified. That afternoon one of
these same merchants bought a b!g stock
of American kero-fcne.and another a large
stock of American flour to tide them over
the storm. ' ,' -
The boycott movement aroused 'con
siderable excitement and on the night of
July 18 some miscreant, incited by the
boycott movement, pulled down the hal
yard of the American flagpole, scattered
filth about the foot and posted an anti-
American, placard upon ihe pole.. The
outrage was taken up with the officials
by Consul George E. Anderson on jthe
morning cf the 19th and has>been thrash
ei out between Amoy and the Viceregal
Court at Foochow, "with some action from
Peking in the meanwhile.
The \u25a0 local officials, while originally will
ing to make amends for the outrage, were
afraid. to do so publicly lest the agitators
should go after them,. for bowing, to*the
foreigner. A flag salute waslnsisted .upon
by the Consul, however, and the, pressure
he was able to bring upon the provincial
officials carried the day. and the \ salute
was ordered. ; :_:'], .-':,['.
In the meanwhile the Consul found that
the leader of the boycott agitation In
Amoy was a citizen of the Philippines, In
terested in the Philippine trade, the situ
ation thereupon showing either that this
leader could - be held ' amenable to Philip
pine law for his boycott agitation or else
he \ would forfeit his right to engage in
the coasting trade as a Philippine citizen.
After a conference with the Consul this
person, who was formerly Chinese Consul
at Manila and bears the Spanish name ot
Engracio Palanca. decided that he wanted
nothing more to do with the boycott and
promised to urge other merchants to give
up the movement.
On th^ morning of August 2 the mer
chants had a meeting and decided to
have nothing more to do with the move
ment. Palanca is said to be going to Sing
apore for his' health.
WASHINGTON,' Sept. 7.â Consul Gen
eral Rodgers at Shanghai cabled the
State Department to-day as follows:
The general opinion is that the boycott *iÂ»
practically abandoned here, at least for the
present, - and the -\u25a0 latest reports from other
parts of China. Indicate that the situation in
rtspect to the boycott against American goods
Is much Improved.

Bunkers Confes
sion Valiieless Un
less He Returns.
SACRAMENTO. Sept. ".âThe great
sensation that accompanied the an
nouncement that ex-Senator Harry Bunk
ers, ebnvlbted boodler,-. had confessed, has
exploded. In its place has come conster
nation, 'wrought by the. fear that with
the possible exception of Bunkers, already
convicted, but with the chances that go
with appeal in his favor, the guJity Sena
tors , will escape the' cont>fcUiÂ»e.-Â»<-fcS o f their
crime. Th:s T fear is the outuiowth ol the
general bc-liet tnat Joseph S. Jordan,
whose confession opened San Quentln's
road : to Bunkers?. ~ will not return to Sac
ramento to bear witness against the men
that conspired with him to use their
power to loot and bribe, and It is said
'authoritatively, should Joraan refuse to
return to Caii.omla to testify. Bunkers'
testimony wil! : but , clumsily weld the
broken link in the chain of evidence
against the accused awaiting trial. Jor
dan has announced, that he "will return,
but his word is doubted, and most of all
by, Harry Bunkers, who, pale and a wreck
of his former ; self, says:
"Jordan is not what 1- thought he^.was.
His word, means nothing." '
tjo from j heroics the whole story of
Bunkers' confession has dwindled to
farce, and, with Jordan absent, will
supp.y a link -that may shatter under the
hammering of the defense. *
XO OTHERS IMPLICATED.
There is one thing, however, that is a
certainty, and that is that Bunkers has
contined "his confession- to the crime
that locked prison doors behind him- If
there is a conscience-stricken solon in
the State whose condition of mind is
due to participation. in any offense but
this, he may: free his mind of terror of
exposure, for there will be none from
the prisoner, not because he is unwill
ing to expose any and all for revenge,
.but r because he knows nothing. His
confession is confined alone to the con
spiracy to bribe ,in which he, Eli
Wright, Frank. French and E. J. Era
mons are concerned, and to those that
aided them in disposing of the swag
that was the fruit of their crime. -
That any effort to secure a confession
from Bunkers was made by District At
torney Seymour was ; due , alone to the
fact that Jordan had crossed the boun
daries of the State, 'without bond or
promise to return. He is now in Tono
pah. Nevada,. the master of a situation
that clumsy methods', made -possible. "He
is. where no subpena can avail and is
immune under^the law from prosecution
for. his crime. * No bond, is in the hands
of; the authorities to secure his : return,
and ifÂ»lt: is his .will- to stay { away -it is
\u2666the opinion of well" informed attorneys
of this city the boodlers will go free.
And these are the reasons. Bunkers at
host can: only aid in establishing the con
spiracy of which he, Ell Wright.' E. J.
Emmons and Frank French stand ac
cused. There is no knowledge in his pos
session, '[ a fact, admitted by both the
prosecution and the ; defense, that wlil
enable him. to establish the payment to
his co-consplrators Â«of . the money that
went to complete the L crime for* which
they : stand : indicted. :
Before the Senate investigating commit
tee detectives testified as. to the passing
off the money, but one said the green
backs were in rolls, the other that the
greenbacks lay flat when Jordan handed
them out to the" accused. 'This variation
In the testimony of the detectives is suf
ficient to raise a doubt as to the actual
passing of 'the money.
DETECTIVES' TESTIStfOXY.
â¢It did, raise a /doubt, but Jordan set
this at res^. by admitting ( that the testi
mony of the. detectives was, in 'the. main,
correct. But," in the , trials to : come,; the
detectives must adhere to their original
testimony given ;.. before the Senate â¢ in
vestigating committee and, there is no one
here to say, in face of their conflict as
to how the notes were paid, that they are
right in their' testimony -even as to gen :
eraltities. to say nothing of particulars.
In their , testimony the detectives,
who are borne out, to the letter by
Jordan in this particular, sty that' the
disgraced Senators were all paid sep
arately^ Emmons at Eighth and X
streets, and Bunkers at another place
and' time.; ; It was strictly urged ; in
the prior,' hearing : that; neither Senator
was j in , sight nor , hearing \u25a0of : Ihe other
when paid the bribed money by Jordan.
This; admission renders any, confession
Bunkers;; has made useless :an estab
lishing | the | payment of; money to the
indicted ex-Senators ;that remain to be
tried. So It Is that the fear has arisen
that Jordan. will decide to remainrwith-

With Joseph Jordan, the newspaper man who handled the
coin for the boodlers during the last Legislature, out of the
State and immune from any subpena, no bond having been re
quired for his return to serve as witness against French*,
Wright and Emmons, the confession of Harry Bunkers, the
convicted boodler, becomes but a clumsy weapon in the hands
of the prosecutors. The confession deals with none 'but the
disgraced quartet, and, in the opinion /of .many lawyers, be
cause of Jordan's absence, is of little value to the State.-
out the State ,^nd the guilty go "free
in conseauence.
Some time ago District Attorney 3-y
mour was warned .that he hal erred
in permitting Jordan to get beyond his
reach without giving bonds for his re
appearance. District Attorney Seymour
maintains, however, that he has the
fullest confidence in Jordan's word arÂ»tl
that he will be here when wanted.
Jordan is now In Tonopah. -It is a' two
days' trip from that boomin;? mining
camp of Nevada to the capitol of Cali
fornia.. Emmons goes to. trial next
Monday. Jordan must rush If he. In
tends to keep his word.
MONEY IS EXHIBITED.
A story is going the rounds to-night
Â»that the most seriously involved per
son in Bunkers' confession outside of
the accused Senators is "Jimmy" Cope
land, attorney, wno appeared for the
boodlers at me time of their exposure
in tne Senate. It is said that CopelanU
was in the office of a prominent attor
ney when, without solicitation, he
drew from his pocket thÂ« marked bills
used to bribe the disgraced Senators
anu said the money had at last found
a willing and a fearless custodian, one
that would prevent its destruction and
that would put it to Its best uses,
marked or not.
Bunkers asserts positively that his
confession concerns alone the case that
has cost him so tiearly.
"It only goes that far," he said to
nlgrht. "It does not go beyond my own
offense, and all I have been promised is
that in event I am given a new trial it
will not be used against me nor will
it be uses as the basis for a charge
of perjury for the denials I made when
on trial for my liberty."
Bunkers is to .be pitied. He has lost
sixty pounds since the jail doors closed
upon him and his face is white as
chart k. Retribution has laid Its hand
heavily upon him. Ho hopes it will be
laid upon those that have left him to
his fate. .
WIFE IS FAITHFUL.
Mrs. Harry Itunkrr* Declares Belief la
Husband* Innocence.
While her husband paces to and fro <
In his prison cell at Sacramento, heap
ing curses upon his late associates and
daily confessing more- truths to Dis- ;
trict Attorney Seymour, the wife of i
former Senator Harry Bunkers is busi
ly working in her tiny chophouse at
1181 Market street, earning her living
in an honest way. The strain of the
last few months has told on the brave
little woman. There are dark places
under her eyes and she appears drawn
and nervous. Not a word of complaint
does she utter, but courageously \u25a0 she
faces the world and attends 'to the.
wants of her customers.' \
Of her '\u25a0 husband she talks with per
fect freedom, 'although she maintains
that^she knows. .-nothing of the sena
torial scandals. . "My - Harry never
talked much j about his business af
fairs to me," she said yesterday after
noon during a lull in trade, "we only
conversed upon general topics. When
he first went to the Senate I would ask
him about things up there, but he
wouldn't tell me a thing. He used- to
tell me that he could not trust his
secrets to women because they always
had some confidential friend' to whom
they would run Instantly and give the
thing away. What he meant by that
I do not know. At the time I thought
nothing of it, nor did I blame him for
keeping quiet about his own business.
I did not believe then,' nor do I believe
now,, that he was doing anything that
he wished to hide from the world be
cause he was ashamed to have, It
known. It will all come out all right
in the end.
"I do not know one thing about his
so-called confession.. I only know what
I have seen in the papers about it. He
has said absolutely nothing. about it to
me. Yes, I have heard from him, but
there is nothing in any of. his letters
which even hinted of his connection
with that scandal nor of his late con
fession." -> ?
Brave little Mrs. Bunkers tried hard
to appear unconcerned over the mat
ter of her husband's imprisonment and
confession, but Jhe tears would come.
She cried softly for a few. moments,
evidently trying. to throw off the emo
tion, "it will come out all right," she
quavered, "but the waiting is very hard
to bear." , Then the courageous woman
busied herself % with" the affairs of the
restaurant. L-..''-o/-
Arthur Lee, the negro Legislative at
tendant who is held as a witness in the
Emmons case {and who is expected to
swear that he saw the marked bills
given to the former. Senator, is again
at his place of business on Bush street
waiting ; for the opening: o< the trial.
He denies all knowledge of the Bunk-
ers confession. He does not seem ths
least perturbed over his arrest and
consequent release on bonds. He will
return to Sacramento on Monday.
SECRET AGENT HAZEN
IS QUIETLY MARRIED
Weds Mrs. Minnie Minor
Lord of New York
- City.
Georce "W. Hazen. head of the local
United States Secret Service Bureau, and
Miss Minnie Minor Lord of New York
were quietly married in this city yester
day afternoon. The ceremony was per
formed in the chambers of Justice of the
Peace Dunn at the City Hall and im
mediately after the nuptial knot had been
tied the happy couple hurried from the
City Hall and have not been heard from
since. The news of Hazen's marriage
will surprise his friends In this city,
for he kept his intentions a secret to
the very last moment.
Shortly after 5 o'clock yesterday after
noon Justice Dunn received a telephone
message that a couple were on their way
to his chambers and a few minutes later
Hazen and bis prospective bride and John
F. Cronln, secret service agent in Los
Angeles, mads their appearance. The
bride gave her residenc as the Grand
Hotel and said she had arrived in this.
city but a short time before. Reference
to the hotel register last evening dis
closed the name of Miss Minnie Minor
from New York and the fact that she
had arrived in the afternoon and de
parted two hours later readily suggested
that the guest and the bride of an hour
later were the same person.
The first intimation the friends of
Hazen at the Hotel Repeiier on Sutter
street, where he lived, received of his
marriage was whn newspapr reporters
called there last evening. The detective
had been seen in a most jovial mood
earlier in the afternoon when he left the
hotel, but no cue imagined that he was
then on his way to join his betrothed.
The secrecy with which Hazen and hi 3
bride attempted to surround their mar
riage is attributed by several of their ac
quaintances to the fact that their name?*
were prominently connected with a recent
row at the Hotel St. Kathryn, when Ha
zen administered a severe beating to on.j
of the clerks. Mrs. Hazen Is a woman
of remarkable beauty. She was a
widow when Hazen first met her In
New York, her husband's name being
Lord.
! She finally came to San Francisco and
; engaged in the manicuring business, first
in a barber shop on Post street and later
in 'the barber shop in the Si. Francis Ho
tel, where, Hazen was frequently seen.

The Rev. F. A. Morrow, who at the
last Methodist Conference resigned ow
ing to charges which had been made
against him. has prepared a pamphlet
with the intention that it shall defend
his character and standing in the com
munity., .
It is a stinging defense and appeals
to the conference In this fashion: "Are
you going to help my. persecutors until
I am bounded to my grave? Can any
thing be more unjust when I have
never been proved guilty of wrongdo-
Ingr
The charges against Mr. Morrow ar4
said to have been most serious, and at
the conference a committee was ap
pointed to investigate them. The
committee ultimately recommended
that Mr. Morrow either stand trial or
withdraw, and it is said that he accept
ed the alternative and withdrew.
That he will not "present" whatever
pamphlet he may have written In de
fense of himself to the coming Method
ist Conference is a certainty, according
to several gentlemen highly : connected
with the Methodist church. They say
that anything he has written cannot be
considered by the conference and that
he knows that as well as any on<* else
of the denomination.

ered. It is understood that the dele
gates in caucus, comprising a major
ity of the convention, will settle the
question of the Mayoralty nomination
and also doflne the policy of the con
vention .as to the advisability of re
jecting the Ruef delegations from the
Thirty-second and Thirty-Ninth' As
sembly districts.
The duty of calling the caucus to
order and presiding over the delibera
tions of the body will, devolve upon
Mr. Partridge. All delegates who have
resolved to support the league in -its,
efforts to rescue the city from the
clutch of grafters will be to
the caucus. The duty of attendance on
the part of every delegate elected un
der the banner of the Republican
league is obvious and imperative.
The league do<s not attach much-im
portance to the efforts of Ruef to de
tach Sam N. Levy, a delegate of the
Fortieth Assembly District, from the anti-
Ruef column. Frtd Trieste, formerly em
ployed as a convasser. of. the Republican
League, represents that he wal sent for
by Kutf, and that the latter promised to
pay him 5150 if he would bring. Delegates
Sam N. Levy, Joseph Marks and Patrick
J. Mehegan to Ruefs office^ Trieste re
ports that Mr. Marks would - not listen
tj the proposition and that Mr. Mehegan
could not be seen. jir. Levy,* It is said,
inquired how much Rue- would give and
Trieste reported that $5000 would .be the
sum. Levy replied that he was too busy
at that time (noon yesterday) to visit
Ruef's office, but would go there at 3 p.
m. Later in the day Levy informed Jesse
E. Marks of the overtures. Trieste also
told the story to Perry Newberry of the
Republican League. A Pinkerton detec
tive, engaged by the league to shadow
Trieste, reported that the latter was
visiting Ruef's, office. It seems that Ruef
became suspicious of Trieste and also en
gaged a detective to do the shadowing
business.' Trieste went to Ruef's office to
collect the amount promised him, but was
turned down. Trieste contends that the
negotiations were opened by Ruef.

Mears was getting ready , to go to town
with his brother Frank. The latter left

remained in the house. No one else was
at home. After Frank had arrived at
the barn he heard a shot from, the house,
but thought nothing of , it, ashe'and his
brother had just previously been exam
ining a shotgun. When, however; he ar
rived at the house he found John sitting
by the table with' his head bowed for
ward, a great hole in the back of it
from which blood was flowing. John was
dead. The location of the wound pre
eludes the idea of suicide. The young
man had no reason to kill himself. The
discharged shotgun was.Jying near and it

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
GYPSIES SALUTE
A NEW RULER
Giant "King," Alexander
Adams, Comes From East to
Bule Orer Berkeley Camp
GIVES COOL DEFIANCE
Is Rich Man and Softly In
forms Officials He Will Give
Them Diplomatic Battle
BERKELEY, Sept. 7.â lnvestigation by
Marshal August Vollmer and Health Of
ficer George Reinhardt to-day in connec
tion with their campaign to rii the uni
versity town of a big band of gypsies re
vealed the fact that the camp Is now
commanded by the most famous ruler In
all the world of gypsy folk, a gigantic
firure of a man In almost every way,
who may be expected to give the officers
of the university town a battle royal, in
a diplomatic sense, before his subjects
arc ousted from their picturesque retreat
on the Grayson Tract.
Alexander Adams, a rtcn man. is the
new king of the gypsies. The commander
of the swarthy skinned, black-eyed, old
world Bort of a vagrant army is Falstaf
fl&n in appearance in many respects, and
as evil-looking as picturesque. With the
appearance of Alexander Adams on the
scene enters a new factor in the war of
the gypsies to retain their coign of vant
age on this side of the bay.
The wealth of Alexander Adams, ac
cumulated through years of -rule as a
gypsy king is estimated in the six figure
schedule. He has coin in the banks, prop
erty in several cities, land that is his very
own. and to aid him in holding that
which he has won, "King" Adaxns has a
keen wit, a cunning mind and physical
strength in abundance.
GIAAT "KING'S" SOFT SPEECH.
. When Marshal Vollmer descended to
day upon the big camp cf gypsies, down
by the shore of the bay at West Berke
ley, and was introduced to Alexander
Adams as the new king of the tribe, he
looked into the eyes of a massive man,
six feet four Inches in height, apparently
strong as a bull, and yet smooth spoken
as a Japanese diplomat.
The possession of wealth has given
"King" Adams sangfroid and nerve in
abundance. He fears not police officer
ncr the health department's mandates,
for will not his coin hire lawyers and
procure advice as to how the mandates
of the powers that be may be evaded?
Adams, speaking for his gypsy tribe,
said to Marshal Vollmer: "You threaten
to arrest our people, and me, too? Very
well. Go ahead. Arrest me. I have
money to pay any fine imposed, or to pay
for my people. We wish no trouble with
jour departmt-nt, but we are advised that
with a lease cf this property we cannot
be ousted and we are responsible for any :
alleged violations of the law."
To Health OQcer Reinhardt the big
STjpsy "king" spoke smoothly, saying that
all sanitary conditions which the law re
quired to be complied with would be
maintained, fcut there was in his talk an
under current of defiance that was so un
like the ordinary gypsy palaver as to star
tle the phlegmatic Dr. Reinhardt and in
spire him to find out who and what this
new manner of gypsy "king" might be.
GOLD SPEAKS ALL LANGUAGES.
Then it was learned that Alexander
Adams has come from the East to com
mand this branch of the gypsy tribe and
to rule absolutely the gypsy folk here.
The former "king." Mitchell Demetrjo,
has left, been beaten off, apparently, and
with him has gone a small section of the
tribe. Alexander Adams is now supreme,
lord of the camp, receiving tribute from
gypsy maid and man. dispensing justice,
meeting the powers cf the law and in
ether ways serving as master absolute.
Adams shows letters from brokers and
realty agents in Eastern cities, dealing
wjth matters affecting his properties In
the East. Adams writes and speaks ex
cellent English, conducts his finances
shrewdly and smiles at the talk of dis
possessing his people of their camping
place in Berkeley.
With "King" Adams to deal with, the
Berkeley officials have now to plan a new
campaign, having as its end the ridding of
Berkeley of all the gypsies. What method
can be adopted remains to be seen, and
meanwhile "King" Adams and his hosts
hold the fort, and the giant ruler clinks
the gold in his pocket, smiling the while
et peace officers who come to interview
him. Romany blood is in all his veins,
and gypsy are his eyes and other features,
but gold speaks all languages, says the
"king," and none has as yet been able
to gainsay his potent argument.

OAKLAND MOLE
Southern Pacific Company
Begins Work of, Improving
Its East Shore Terminal
OAKLAND, Sept. 7>â The work of
altering and improving the ferryj depot
at the Oakland mole, which .when com
pleted will give room not only for a
much larger number of trains, but also
for a slip ''for.': freight boats at the
broad gauge pier, has already been
commenced and will be completed as
soon as possible. The Southern Pa
cific Company has planned to ' enlarge
the bay end of * the mole enough to
give room for a new ferry slip at the
south of the present ferry depot, and
the consequent widening :-will give
room for -an Increased, number of
tracks, allowing -a x much larger num
ber of trains at the depot atone time. .
Steadily increasing traffic by way of
the broad gauge mole has made .more
depot and train room an absolute neces
sity, but owing, to the fact that "every
available inch of space at. the pier was
already in use, the company has not
attempted to secure more room' until
plans could be completed for a:sub
stantial, enlargement of the entire end
of the pier." .-.'-; \u25a0
The widening; of - the pier \u25a0;{ will be
commenced at a . point about midway
between the shore and the end :of the
pier, near the place where the \trestle
leading to the West. Oakland 'yards
now joins the mole. From that .point
the ; mole --.w ill be ,- gradually extended
south until a bay front-; 300 "feet .wide
is afforded. .:; By this â¢- means the; com
pany will provide " room' for ". four new
tracks on the mole: and twelve at the
ferry depot. -
Most :. Important of all the changes,
however, will be the addition'- of a
freight ferry slip to. the present equip
ment. This will" allow, a much large*
amount , of .'freight to be handled on
the broad gauge route and will "elimi
nate a great part of the /present delay
In ; passenger .traffic which is ; now
caused by ;, the loading and ; unloading
of freight on" the "passenger boats. *At
first the widening of 'the pier will con
sist only of the construction" of a new
pier to the south of ; the present ; ferry
depot, but -it" IS; the .intention of . ;the
company to s later ; fill-in: the'strip-be
tween the proposed new pier, and. the
depot : and^ make the whole 'aÂ» continu
ous fill of ''solid ground. '\u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0. While -it has
not 1 been . stated *by ' the ; company/ that
such is the fact, it is thought 'that the
enlargement of the mole will r mean 'the

One of the most interesting things the
Sequoia has to its credit is the reception
given last night at the home of the
club, 584 Sutter. street,. with Mr. and .Mrs.
Charles Sedgwick Alken the honor guest 3.
Although it was strongly hinted that
the popular president and his bride would
be highly delighted at the absence of a
club demonstration it hadn't the slightest
effect upon the club. The Sequoia. Isn't
built that way,' and the house commit
tee went right ahead making its arrange
ments. â¢- â¢ . ,
And of course the guests of honor
cameâ just as the committee. hoped they
would, , if the worst came -Ma the worst.
Arid a" wealth of \u25a0* good -feeling \u25a0 and sin
cerest â¢friendship^ greeted ~ themâfriend

green branches.* \u25a0' "\u25a0 ;
Among the several hundred guests, who
called were Mme. Oliva Petrella 1 Tied

And thus did the Sequoia auspiciously
begin its winter stunts. It will give a
reception next Thursday night in honor
oi Mr. and Mrs. O'Sulllvan and two
other well-known visitors to town, con
tinuing its Thursdays through the sea

A clever cartoon by Maynard Dixon
ornamented the bulletin board, expressive
of the club's sentiments in' regard to the
matrimonial step of Its well-beloved
leaders.

AFTER SCOTT
Election Board Is Making
Most of Young 3lairs
Misapprehension of Law
SAY HE MUST APPEAE
Primary Officials Testify
That the Harrison Street
Home Was Long Vacant
The Board of Election Commission
ers will endeavor to teet the law in
regard to false registration in the
event that its plans for the arrest of
Laurance Irving Scott mature in the
near future. Scott is alleged to have
falsely registered for the last primary
election. According to the roster of
the Second Precinct of the Twenty
eighth District Scott's residence is 507
Harrison street. This address is
averred by the commission to have
been unoccupied for a year past.
y At the regular meeting of the board
Vast night Scott failed to answer the
citation issued to him for his appear
ance. On motion of Commissioner L.ef
fingwell. seconded by Commissioner
Devoto. a last citation will be sent by
mall to Scott at 507 Harrison street
as required by law. If the defendant
dees not then present himself before
the board Registrar Adams will be or
dered to -ewejir to a warrant charging
Scott with violation of tne election
laws. All attempts on the part of the
Deputy Registrar to serve Scott with a
citation have failed, it is alleged.
The election officers in the booth
where Scott is alleged to have at
tempted to vote told on the witness
stand of Scott's attempt to caÃt a bal
lot and his subsequent challenge by
Citizen Edward W. Haughy of 327 First
etreet. Haughy testified that Scott had
not lived at 607 Harrison street for
one year prior to the primary. He
said it was common talk in the neigh
borhood that the house given in the
roster as Scott's residence had not been
occupied for a year.
Final citations were ordered Issued
to I. "W. Hellman Jr. and P. C. Rossi
and William Lewis of the Palace Hotel
to appear and show cause why they
had not served as election officers at
the primary election. The registered j
men who were recently found by the i
United States District Attorney to have
been fraudulently naturalized will be
Ferved with citations to \u25a0 appear and:
show cause why their names should
\u25a0jrz: be stricken from the registration
1 A letter was ordered sent to the po
lice asking their assistance in the ap
rtrehension of a man who was canvass
ing the Thirty-seventh District Im
personating a deputy registrar and
catechising voters.
Josiah R. Howell appeared in obedi
ence to a citation and explained why
he had not been able to serve as an
election officer at the primaries. He
was excused.

MULATTO MAN'S IDEA
THAT HE COULD SING
BREAKS UP HIS HOME
His Babe Bawls in Affright When He Vojces
'"Pawpah' s Li'l, Punkin Colored Coon." . \u25a0
Remonstrance From His Better Half Results
in His Arrest for Slapping Her Jaw.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Mrs. George Ferguson, a petite young
mulatto with a dimpled yellow babe in
arms, informed Police Judge Fritz that
her husband, also of chocolate hue, was
an excellent provider for his family until
he became possessed of the erroneous
idea that he could sweetly sing. From
that moment until the time of his arrest
on her charge of battery he had neglected
his domestic establishment and spent
most of his days and nights in Barbary
Coast music halls.
"En de lawd knowa," Mrs. Ferguson
added, "no man hez hed less 'casion teh
'bandon ez home den 'c hez hed. Ah done
all. Ah cud- teh 'tribute to ez comfut, en
de fust en on'y time Ah got real mad at
*Im wuz w'en *c 'slsted on singin' at de
baby en skeerln" et en makin" et weep."
"You don't consider him vocally pleas
ing, then?" the court ventured.
"Xo. sah; Ah doan. 'E kain't sing teh
please nobuddy but hisself. Ah'm fond
ob good singrin,' but Ah. kain't Stan' de
noises 'c meks en calls singln.' "
Further interrogation elicited the intel
ligence that it was a lullaby entitled
"Pawpah's Li'l Punkin-Cullud . Coon" Mr.
Ferguson voiced when he frightened his
offspring and thereby provoked his better
half's wrath. When she remonstrated he
slapped her jaw. '
"Xo, Ah doan s'plcion dah's anuddah
woman in de case," the complainant said
In response to a Judicial query. "Et's
kase "c 'magines .'c kin sing dat 'c loafs
in de free-an-easles on de Coast."
Mr. Ferguson moodily hearkened to the
disparagement of his warbling and â¢ re
served his defense until to-day. He dwells
at 1191 Pacific street and was an industri
ous washer of- windows when the whim
that he could charm with his voice seized
\u25a0him and spoiled his domesticity.
When the 'longshore laborers employed
on the Broadway wharf learned that Fri
day was the anniversary of Sam Tracy's
birth they unanimously extended con
gratulation, expressed hope that he would
have many happy returns of the occasion,
and requested him to celebrate by treat
ing them. to beer. He declined to do so,
pleading that he did not desire to in
capacitate them for work, and then one
of them hinted that his refusal was
prompted by a spirit of stinginess rather
than by consideration for their welfare.
"To prove I ain't no miser." warmly
retorted Mr. Tracj\ "I'll stake each of
you to a ten-cent chance in Chinese, lot-
tery."
"We'll go you," was the chorussed ac
ceptance, and twenty-one sturdy sons of
toil, including Mr. Tracy himself, forth
with paraded to the lottery shop con
ducted by Ah Gee at 25 Broadway. The
numerical strength or the procession
awakened the curiosity of an observant
policeman, and as soon as he ascertained
its object he telephoned his information
to headquarters. Result â raid of the lot
tery establishment by Sergeant Ross and
a large posse, arrest of the twenty-one
Caucasion visitors and Ah Gee, and sus
pension of Industry on the Broadway
wharf because of inability of the white
prisoners to obtain bail ere the day
closed.
When the twenty-two defendants
were arraigned before Judge Conlan
he fined the white men ?5 apiece and
postponed till this morning the sen
tencing of Ah Gee. Mr. Tracy's com
panions suggested that as their arrest
was Included In his treat he pay all
the fines, but he confessed insolvency.
Then.they withdrew all the returns of
the previous day they had so cordially,
wished for.
Pomposo Ferros, a gigantic Mexican,
annoyed the young married daughter
of Lola Padrillas, who dwells at 524 Val
lejo street, by conveying the impres
sion to the Latin colony that he was
her chosen protector while her husband
was pursuing his vocation at sea.
Ah, heaven, no; neither Lola Padril
las nor her daughter had ever encour
aged the great pig Ferros to bring such
scandal upon their name. Well would
it be for the porcine Ferros if the Senor
Judge Fritz sent him to Jail,, for Lola
Padrillas' son-in-law was of hot tem
per ana would seek to avenge the in
sult to his wife, whom he loved, ah, so
greatly, when he returned from the sea.

ant, then /sentenced .him to fifteen
months' imprisonment. \
Miss Molise lives with her parents at

she has been : annoyed every time she
went abroad, by the negro thrusting at

minating : in" his seizing her arm- and

"Ah knows .'. 'er.- bradder-. -en hey

Judge Mogan has under advisement
tlie case of ten Chinese male adults who
are accused of having violated the or
dinance which prohibits the playlnsf of
poker 'for money, behind closed doors.
Patrolman George Collins, who led the
posso that made the arrests, is as cer
tain as can be that cash was at stake
in the game, but as he could produce
only celluloid disks as material evi
dence and could not prove that they. had
been paid for by their possessors, or
even that they represented lucre, his
Honor decided that the case would not
be damaged lr. any way by being given
careful deliberation ere it is disposed
of. It was in a rear apartment of the
retail cigar shop at 33 "Waverly place
that the ten defendants were gathered
up. Four of them were playing jack
pots, and an oral dispute as to the le
gality of one gentleman having opened
on a four-flush, drawn one card and
filed his suite waxed so warm that
the contending voices attracted the at
tention of a policeman who happened
to be sauntering past the store. Sur
mising that a game was In progress,
he Informed headquarters of; his '\u25a0 find,
and the raid by Collins et'al. was the
result.
When the officers dashed lntoth-s
room they found the ten inmates hur-
riedly concealing the evidence of their
pastime, but so abrupt was the invasion
that they were fairly "caught with the
goods," as one policeman told the court,
said goods consisting of cards and
-."chips," . and when the prisoners were
searched some cards were discovered in
places wherothey had apparently been
deposited prior to the sounding of the
alarm. In one . gentleman's left shoe
were found three aces, and threes - and
pairs of other denominations were pick-,
ed from sleeves, and Inside ;:\u25a0 pockets
of blouses. The crowning find, how
ever, was a straight flush of . clubs. ,, It

Reverend John D. Maguire
Gives Lecture to Large
Crowd at the Cathedral
The lecture of Reverend Father John D.
Maguire, Ph. D.. of Washington. D. C.
on "The Church and the Age" at St.
Mary's Cathedral last night was one of
the t most . masterly resumes of the po
sition of the church ever given. The ca
thedral was crowded . and the scholarly
eloquence of the speaker held the people
till the last word was uttered.
In words that only one who had mada
the subject hfs life study' could find the
reverend father reviewed the history of
the Catholic church and dwelt upon its
future prospects. "The church that has
led in science, literature and art; the
church that talked Greek to the Greeks
and Latin to the Romans â shall she be
messageless in this age. the most glorious
and the most critical age in the history of
mankind?" he asked.
Father? Maguire' vividly pictured the
dark days of the church, emphasizing its
adaptability to all sorts of conditions and
changes. "Through all changes she re
mains unchangeable," he declared. "She
Is always universal and always catholc.
You will find her influence in the cotter's
hut, in the laboratories and in the libra
ries, on land and on sea."
The lecture was given for the benefit of
the Children's Day Home, conducted by
the Sisters of the Holy Family. Father
Maguire is from the Catholic University
at Washington. D. C. He is a compara

COLLEGE LUXURY.
TÂ»HE opening day at Stanford University was used by; the acting
of the faculty for the purpose of advising the students in a
matter that is attracting attention in ali American colleges.
\Vith the rise of college fraternities has appeared a growing dispo
sition to be extravagant in personal expenditures by students. \Ve
do not say that this extravagance is the result of college fraternities,
but it is concurrent with their increase. " .' ". . ,; ; \u0084,..'.,";
The support of a student at college has become a burden at
which parents of moderate means flinch. In too many cases the
fond hopes that have been formed over the cradles of children are
ended in black despair, as the result of trying to equip ttfem for
the duties of life by a college education. Too frequently this effort
absorbs the savings of years of industry and condemns parents in
their old age to keep up the hard toil of their prime, only to find that
the "college spendthrift extravagancy and love of -luxury have" inca
pacitated their children, for that saving self-support. that is the be
ginning of independence. The young are imi^ativej susceptible to
banter and ridicule, and nothing seems Â» harder than -,to keep
up one's end in college life. . ' ;. i^< ~
The son of frugal parents who have bent their back^stp save
tiiat he might have an education goes, to thfe" university with his
simple tastes and frugal . habits./.. He finds that; to be in the swim
he must join a fraternity. The tomfoolery of initiation ' over, his
new dignity gives him the entree to hospitalities and dissipations
which when accepted must be reciprocated. The plain boy soon
finds that his greatest anxiety is not to stand well in his classes, but
to stand well with the spenders in his set. If he finish his course
by hook or crook, nothing that he has learned in the classroom has
exercised as great a formative influence upon his character as the
waste of time andÂ«money incident to what, he regards as the social
side of college life. He knows nothing about the toil required to
earn a dollar, and money burns his pocket until it is spenrfor what
does him- harm. , â¢
The close of his college life finds him with a canvasback taste
yoked to less ability to earn than is necessary for a pickled pork
appetite. He knows nothing of" the virtue of saving the nickels till
they grow to dimes and dollars, but he knows all about spending
the nickels as if they were dollars .and grew, on bushes. We. by no
means say that making money and acquiring wealth should absorb
all of a man's life and energies. But every man, and especially
even, 7 college bred man, owes it to himself and society to use faith
fully all honest means and all honest industry to establish himself
in life oiy the plane of personal independence.' Unless he early
acquire habits of economy, of thrift and saving, he will drag through
life a parasite, spendthrift and idler.
We regret to say> as the result of many years of observation,
that our American colleges and universities are the source of spend
thrift habits which projected into after life . are the cause of ap
palling failures, and of the keenest sorrow, to parents whose hopes
are blighted. . For many years past the successful university men
are those who have not even depended- on th^eir parents for sup
port while they , were getting education. ' They are men who as
boys were so ambitious to achieve the primacy that is conferred by
learning that they worked their way through college. Vice Presi
dent Fairbanks worked as a carpenter to carry himself .through his
classics and his law course, earning every, penny, for his college
expenses by his own labor. Stephen A. Douglass earned his living
as a cabinetmaker while studying for the bar, and the late Senator
Palmer of Illinois was a working cooper. ( and toiled at his trade for
support while he read law. At Grawfordsyille, Indiana," th^ people
proudly exhibit the saddler's bench- â¢ where- Senator Joseph Me-,-
Donald worked for a living while studying r for his profession. Be
yond these noted cases are thousands of others less known because
the individuals have preferred the success of' private life. To;thenV
learning was so precious and" its influence upon life and character
so worthy of self-sacrifice, that they avoided the luxury and 'lures
of college life, and lived it for what it ought to be, a sober prepara
tion for meeting the great issues of life.
The acting head of Stanford Has uttered" timely adyice to his
students. But that is hardly . enough. The habit of extravagance
and luxury has such a hold upon colleges in this country that the
faculties should be charged with riew duties in the, matter. The
livery bills, tailor bills, expenses for rides, dances and card, parties,
the indulgence in rich and unnecessary food "and drink, should be
brought under faculty supervision and control. When a man enlists
in the army or navy he is compelled to record the name and address
of his parents or next relative or friend: When : a student matri
culates in college he should be compelled to do' the same. Then; some*
responsible officer of the institution should -communicate with his
parents or responsible relative in order to ascertain the true con
ditions. .
Parents will be found readily responsive and willing* to co
operate with the university authorities in keeping a check upon
expenditures and limiting them to the actual amount required for
pursuing studies in comfort. Indulgence in luxury and extravagance
should be restrained by prompt report from the college to the stu
dent's home. In this, way parental influence may follow knowledge
and the student be saved from the perils *of an environment in
which thousands have been wrecked. It is a matter that goes straight
to the usefulness of our higher institutions of -learning. Unless
they cease Xp be schools of luxury,"^recklessness- and extravagance,
they will come to be avoided by all wise parents who desire their
sons to be men and not spendthrift parasites. â¢ , . â¢
OPPRESSED JEWS IN. RUSSIA.
T ABOR unionism can, among its other good works, lay claim
I -. to a large influence in promoting "religious toleration in Russia
according to the tone 'of an appeal sent out by the European
committee of ''The Bund," which is a general federation of Jewish
workers in Littau, Poland and Russia. The purpose of this : bund
is to organize for self-defense against the frequent outbreaks of mob
violence in the Czar's dominions during which, outrages are com-*
mitted upon the persons and property ' of the Semites';^, /f" .
The 'appeal while urgently calling for; ar greater s improvement â¢
in the treatment and safeguarding of the- perÂ§ecuteci race, reports;
that a notable change for the better has recently taken place which
is of great importance to the Jew. It /attributes' this principally to;
two factors : First, the labor movement .which has taken place'
-among the Christians and has spread culture among the masses V
and, second, to the strong Jewish lab'dr movement. which revolu-'
\u25a0lionizes -also the : Christian workingmen.
'â¢'. The bringing together of. Jewish and Christian workingmen
through labor unions is producing a new attitude of 'mind toward
the former, and making it more difficult for the professional 'aritiT
Semite to excite the masses to hate* in the tfelief that the Jews are',
usurers, exploiters and swindlers. The appeal states that this race
and religious hatred with consequent mob violences is. caused by.
priests, . police officers and spies ; and that the" agitators represent.
the Jews as blood-suckers of tlie Russian people,; as 'enemies: of the
Czar, 'of the fatherland and of the Orthodoxxhurch.. and as men Who
have sold themselves to the Japanese for mony.
A feature of the, committee's explanation- is: that the Russian
Government is distinctly ; held accountable, not merely . f ory the rion
hindering of the outrages, but for'their incitement. It states tliat
the riots of 1880 were organized by the Go verririient! and that there
arc proofs of it. , A few police agents sent from St. Petersburg in
flamed the people against the Jews. -, ,-; :: r v *\u0084,;'

'AH', that; was fearful in battle, all that was direftilly bad,

â¢\u25a0\' One was made'up' of college-bred maids and sweet summer girls
typical American -misses of independence â while' the other was composed of
grandmothers,. mothers and aunts, _ gray-haired and gentle- voiced.
The mothers, grandmothers and aunts had been mildly deploring the decad
. ence of chivalry among men. and contrasting the men of yesterday with those of
to-day, greatly to the disparagement of the latter.
Instances were cited to illustrate the old-fashioned husband's extreme devo
tion to his \u25a0. wife, his' consideration of her in, little, things. Then came the story
of the man that buttered his wife's bread and took the : bones out of her flsh.

ROOSEVELT'S VICTORY
(New York World J
IN effecting an agreement between
Japan and Russia President Rooser
velt has won a -splendid vfttory.
His part as peacemaker at Portsmouth
is the "crowning achievement of his
brilliant career. It promises to stand
recorded as the most notable work of
a crowded political life. History cher
ishes few: spectacles so . extraordinary
as his summoning Japan and Russia
from the. bloody battlefield of Man
churia and bringing them face to face
In the quiet Portsmouth conference hall
to settle their savage auarrel. . "'X*'
- Every ' American, ' whether ,he be
Democrat or. Republican/, has just rea
son for pride and patriotism in Mr.
Roosevelt's triumph over tremendous
obstacles. Full credit is his for his un
precedented audacity, for his deliberate
courageMn' stepping, in between the.
warring nations. He ha* the sagacity
to seize the psychological moment and
the persistence to press his point home.
If he had observed .the usual diplomatic
.caution the deadlock of ten days ago
would surely have terminated in open
rupture. He set aside the conventions
and went straight to St. Petersburg
and Tokio with his plea for peace.
But for all his personal force and
perseverance he would have been im
potent if- he had not had behind him
the moral power and prestige of the
nation of which, in " the eyes 'of the
world -and -especially of Japan, he is
the highest representative.
JAPAN MAGNANIMOUS.
7 â¢ (Chicago. Tribune.)
Japan has been magnanimous. It
has yielded 'much, that its statesmen
believed fairly belonged to them. Many
of them feel, as, they did after * the
Chinese war, that they have failed to
get what their victory entitled them to.
But by yielding they have secured
peace and the sympathy of most of the
civilized world.
Each nation .will be free now, thanks
In part to the generous efforts of Pres
ident Roose'veit, to devote, ltself to the
arts of peace. A year more of fighting
would have . exhausted both financially
and an Irredeemable paper currency
would have taken the place of gold in
both empires. They have escaped that
danger^ The Russian Government can
devote itself to the restoration of inter
nal peace and that of Japan to the
restoration of domestic industry and
the exploitation of Korea, j Each has
been so much worn down by war and
Is in such need of rest that.they are
likely to -.remain at peace for many
years.
BOTH SIDES CONGRATULATED.
(New.Tork Tribune.)
There is ample ground for congratu
lation to both of the late .belligerents.
Neither has gained all that It may have
hoped to gain, but then neither has lo3t
all that it might have lost or that it
risked in making its appeal to the
arbitrament of 'war.' The possibilities
of war are so dreadful that any nation
that comes, out of It unrulned may
justly claim congratulations. It was
not easy for so .great and proud a na
tion as Russia to relinquish that which
she wished to hold, to pay forfeit for
deeds jj and to acknowledge her errors
and her defeat; but at least she has not
suffered the extreme abasement and
loss of the wholly vanquished, while
the .lessons she has learned and the
discipline she has endured â which, ac
cording to her own testimony, were
supremely neededâ may, If rightly Im
proved, far more ethanes- repay- her for
her losses. -

* . (Philadelphia Publte' ledger. ) '
The peace conference proved a natural
corollary of the stupendous and tran
scendently Important, events it consid
ered: It furnishes, history. a new chapter
in diplomacy; It places a crown of laurel
upon the brow of America's great Presi
dent, Theodore Roosevelt, the Pacifica

freshly- In the hearts of all lovers of
peace, all friends of humanity, for her'
final acts . of magnanimity and modera
tion, which exalt and glorify her char

liant and heroic ; achievements in .war.

Great as was Bismarck's work-in se
curing peace :at the Berlin ' Congress,
President Roosevelt's '.work on this oc

from disaster. "At the end he secured
the concessions, first from the Csar and
next from the Mikado, which made peace
possible. ' Without \u25a0 President Roosevelt
war would . have been . resumed. Single

jj Baron Komura . will bear home to his
sovereign not merely -the treaty recogni
tion of Japan's right of .political and
commercial expansion, secured "through
the virtue of the: Emperor," â¢by her
troops and fleets. He will carry to him,
he has already won for him and for the
Japanese nation; the applause and ad
miration of all civilized communities.

TOLD IN COURT
Former State Commissioner
Vogelsang Swears to Some
Catches of Rainbow Trout
COINED BEEF IS LIKED
He Says That the Truckee
River Has Been Spoiled
for Anglers by Paper Mill
Former Fish Commissioner Alexander
D. Vogelsang told several charming fish
Ftortes yesterday morning, and the most
peculiar thing about them was that they
were told under oath In a court of law.
He had been called as a witness in the
case of the State of Nevada vs. Floriston
Paper and Pulp Company, before United
States Commissioner tieacock, an action
to restrain the defendants from polluting
the waters and killing the fish of the
Truckee River by emptying chemicals
and other deleterious refuse from its mill
a i Floriston into the stream. Mr. Vogel
eang was well acquainted with the Truc
kee River from 1592 until the close of his
term as commissioner in ISOO, before the
puper mill had gone into operation.
He described with much gusto a five
pound rainbow troujt caught in the river
between Floriston and Reno by George
Crocker cf this city in 1900. The re
maicder of the catch by Mr. Crocker and
his party on that occasion averaged a
pound and a half to the Ilsh. Mr. Vogel
sang went thither very often-niuring the
open season, of courseâ to capture the
beautifully colored swimmers, but as to
their weight he modestly refrained from
any statement. At that time the water
of the Truckee River was pure and palat
able. Since that time, however, he had
refrained from visiting the Truckee River
because of the bad reports given by ang
lers as to the scarcity of trout and thÂ«ir
unwillingness to take the fly owing to
the turbid condition of the water caused
by the chemicals and other refuse from,
the mill. Mr. Vogelsang explained the
very interesting fact in natural history
tiiat rainbow trout do not rise to the
Hy in muddy or discolored waters, and
that they are as voracious as hogs and
fatten upon swill. He mentioned one
specimen in whose stomach was found a
chunk of canned corned beef.
In its complaint against the paper mill
company the State of Nevada alleges
that the water of the Truckee River
which supplies jthe State University at
Reno for ayricultural and household pur
poses has become polluted by the refuse
from the mil^ and is deleterious to the
health of the students.
In order to show the poisonous quality
of the substances used in paper making
W. EL F. Deal of counsel for the plaintiff
called as a witness William Sproule,
ireight traffic manager or the Southern
Pacific Company. Mr. Sproule presented
a typewritten statement of substances
shipped over that road to the mill at
Floristcn during the years 1903, 1201 and
ending August SL li>os. Sulphur leads, the
shipment of -that chemical aggregating
1.4t>7,200 pounds. Then tome magnesite,
v7i\'jZ<>i pounds; lime, 450.550 pounds; alum,
511.0C5 pounds; resin, 95.570 pounds; soda

tics, alcohol, aniline dye. brick dust,

part of the text is as follows:
â¢ Luther Burbank of Santa Hot a Is the most
distinguished citizen of California. Addressing
one -who Is no doubt familiar with - the work
toy which he has achieved International distinc
tion, his place as a benefactor of mankind
will not need further Introduction than Its
mention. What Mr. Burbank haa done for the
promotion of horticulture has hitherto been
at private expense, but recently the Carnegie
Institution has recognized Â» thr value of his
work by an endowment of $100,000, payable in
ten equal installments, to aid him In the fur
ther prosecution of this work.
This event marks a distinct era In the his
tory of our fellow citizen. The California
State Board of Trade has deemed this a tilting
time to make public acknowledgment of the
gift of the Carnegie Institution, and ! to em
phasize the esteem in which Mr. Burbank is
ht-ld, by tendering him a complimentary ban
quet. Mr." Burbank has accepted this tender
and the banquet will be given at the Palace

ERROR DELAYS
SEWER AWARD
Claims of Eival Bidders Bar
Granting of Contract for
Sixth Street Improvement
WANT CITY TO DO WOKR
Potrero Realty Owners Want
Twentieth Street Cut
Through "From Kentucky
It was: ascertained yesterday that ow
ing to an error in the computation of the
bids for. the construction of the . proposed
Sixth-street * sewer, new bids \u25a0 may ' have
to be tnvltedfor the work, which will bi
necessarily:.: delayed on 1 that v account.
When i the ' calculations had been made H
waÂ» found Uhat- the Healy-Tlbbitta . Con*
structlon 1 Company was presumably thÂ«
lowest bidder. . -; - . ;
Frank ' O'Kane, .another bidder, dis
covered, however, that one of the Items
upon j which She had bid ,in connection
with the work was entered on the records
at 10 cents; when . in point of f act- v he had
bid 1 /cent f. thereon. : , O'Kane ', raises^the
contention- that his bid would be f the
lowest had the correct amount been 'en
tered and he .claims that the contract
should . be j awarded to him. He has j filed
a protest against the award to the Healy-
Tibbltta Company. \
..The Board of Works is iii a quandary in
the matter and has taken it under ad
visement: '-.'7 - : :1~* â¢ : : V -x
' A committee from , the Potrero Im

J. I Morser I yesterday to > urge the . cutting
through, of Twentieth street from Ken
tucky to" PotreÂ»o avenue. It was repre
sented that the improvement would bene
fit the immediate neighborhood to a great
extent. \ . . \u25a0 'â¢ -â¢: â¢ . \u25a0\u25a0 "
Morser, however, explained that the
project -, would cost a vast sum of ; money
and would :_ damage - a large /number of

secting streets. \u25a0 The committee thought
the: city .should pay for the work and â¢ it
was pointed '* out , t hat ; bonds would have
to be issued : in a sum ranging from $500,

BIG FELLOW ARRIVES FROM SOUTH
READY TO OFFICIATE AT COLMA.
JEFFRIES f^AYS:
I am liorc in answer to Manager Jim Coffrotlfs telegram requesting me to referee the Britt-Nelson fight and
I will stick and see it out. ] never backed out on any proposition yet and I will not change this time. There
is nothiuir left for me to do but to act. and I am going to do so. " : n
Billy Nolan Fails
to Put in an
Appearance.
Indications Are
Jeffries Will
Officiate.
The Loser's Share
of the Purse Is
Attractive.
There seems no reasonable doubt but |
that Chamricm Jim Jeffries wilL be the \
third man la the ring when Battling Kel
son and Jimmy Britt ccme together to
ni'jrrow afternoon at Colma. The big
JUiow arrived in town last night and
t-tated positively that he Intended to
referee the bout. He says he never quit
in his life and he will go through to the
liJiish this time.
AVhen the news of Jeff's arrival had j
been winded about the line every one was \u25a0
there to greet him. He was cheered as ;
be walked along the streets and greeted
everywhere like the proverbial conquering
hero. "Hurrah for the referee" was the
hue and cry along the line. Every one
teemed satisfied Jeff was to act and they
were all for him.
Billy Nolan did not appear. He kept
in his secluded Colma retreat and did not
go through the formality of informing
any one as to his latest move. Early in
the day he said he would not stand for
Jeff, but it 5s expected he will change his
mind to-day and fall into line with the
band wagon.
Jeffries was in cheery spirits when he
stepped off the train and said, he was
sorry so much talk had resulted from his
selection. In his own determined way he
stated he was here to officiate and he 'in
tended to see the matter through. He
has received telegrams rrom* all over the
country from prominent sporting men
begging him to act and he believes the
public demands that he referee the fight.
JEFF WILL NOT BACK DOWN.
"1 have been officially notified that I
cm to be the referee of the fight," said
Jeff, "and 1 am here in answer to that
summons. I never Quit in my life and
I will not back down this time. Of course
I am sorry Nolan has been making such
a cry about nothing. I have accepted the
fee of $1000 and I want to see this fight
held on the level, for It will be a great
one.
"When I step into that ring both men
will look alike to me. I will not know
one of them from the other and I will
Eive my decision to the man who earns it
if such a thing is necessary. If there is
anything wrong, you can rest assured I
will stop that bout in a second and de
clare everything off. It will have to be a
real fight if I step into that ring."
The arrival of Jeff seeme to have con
vinced everyone in town that the fight
will come off without further hitch. It is
a great boom to the fight and a guarantee
that it will be on its best merits. Jeff
is the choice of the public and they de
mand that he shall act bo that fair play
and justice shall be shown all along the
line.
Billy Nolan will have to do something
to-day. He insisted early yesterday that
Jeff would not enter that ring with the
Dane, while Britt clung to his original
argument. There seems little for Nolan
to do now but to take Jeff. He can show
no sane reason why the big fellow should
rot act and as everyone else wants him
to judge the bout, he will surely be forced
to give in or else be mobbed.
XELSOX'S FATHER ARRIVES.
Battling Nelson's father arrived in town
last night and went direct to the training
quarters of hie son. Prominent sporting
writers from all over the country are be
ginning to arrive. On a late train last
night came George Siler of the Chicago
Tribune, while -Will McÃae. sporting ed
itor of tbe Portland Oregonian, joined the
army of scribes yesterday morning.
There seems no reasonable doubt but
that the fight will take place and that
Nelson will accept Jeffries. The purse is

JEFFRIES DECLARES HE WILL REFEREE
to be divided 60 per cent to the winner
and 40 per cent to the loser.
Should it be Nelson's fate to be the
latter his share of a $70,000 house
would be J15.200. This, with the $5000
he has accepted for his share of the pic
tures, would make his present bank roll
of about $3000 look much healthier.
Manager Nolan receives 25 per cent of
all Nelson's earnings, so the $5000 or
more he will receive if the Dane car
ries out his contract with the Colma
Club is not to be lightly cast aside.
Nolan has no contract with Nelson, and
after the criticism leveled, at. him re
cently it is expected the Dane will have
a new manager soon.
Final payments of $7500 each are due
to-day on the $10,000 side bet. It is not
expected they will be forthcoming.
XOLAVS PERTURBED CONDITION*.
Loses Him Head Completely When Peo-
ple Begin to Talk.
Manager Nolan's perturbed state of
mind over the referee question was ex
plained yesterday as being due to the
efforts of people who wished to promote
the interests of different persons for
referee. Each coterie painted the other
side so black that finally Nolan lost his
head and at the same time lost his hold
on the situation. He could not distin
guish between friends and enemies. For
some days he has been making veiled
allusions about Matt Larkin, one of the
heaviest bettors on the coast and a man
who backed Nelson In all his fights.
"I am at a loss to understand Nolan's
attitude." said Mr. Larkin yesterday.
"I have Just returned from the East and
while I was there Nolan sent me a num-.
ber of telegrams urging me to hurry
back to the coast after the match was
made. When I arrived here I found it
rumored about that Nolan said I was
betting on Britt and that I had an 'un
derstanding* with Jeffries.
"I have never been a sure-thing
fixer; all I wanted was an even break.
I am sorry to see the greatest light
weight fight In many years spoiled by
Nolan's peculiar tactics. Nelson is to
be pitied, as with all this turmoil about
him he cannot fight at his best. He is
a great boy badly managed. I have not
bet on the fight yet. I admire both
boys and hope the best boy wins."
STORY OF THE DIVIDED PURSE.
Xolan Accuses, Britt of lasistlnK-
Upon the Money Being: Shared.
At an early hour this morning Man
ager Nolan made a statement confirm
ing the story that the purse is to be
divided, 60 r>er cent to- the winner and
40 per cent to the loser, and also say
ing that the $10,000 side bet had been
called off. .
"I have been accused by' the Britts
of wanting to split the purse and that
then I would accept Jeffries for ref
eree. I want the public to know that
the proposition to split the- purse came
from the Britts. Saying he repre
sented Willie Britt; Manager Coffroth
came to me and said it was a bad busi
ness proposition for the winner to take
all in such a big- fight and insisted that
we split the purse. I refused for, some
time to consider the proposition, but
finally had to give way. : I\ was â¢ told
there would be, no fight if I did not.
At this same time the. Britts insisted
on the side bet being called off.
"I have not changed my st^nd In the
matter of Jeffries refereelngr , the fight.
Nelson was never more confident of
winning a fight and wants" to have it
out for all time with Britt He will
fight rough-and-tumble or any way
Britt likes, with or without a referee."

BRITT SHOWS
GREAT FORM
Is Bubbling Over
With Freshness
and Mirth.
If Jimmy Britt was worried over Man
ager Billy Nolan's latest ultimatum is
sued on the referee question he disguised
the fact to all visitors yesterday at train
ing headquarters. To those who gathered
In the gymnasulm out at Sheehan's Villa
Jimmy presented an unruffled appearance.
In fact, he was fairly bubbling over with"
freshness and mirth, that.; could not be
restrained. - - "My manager Bill," referring
to his brother, "does the worrying for
me," replied Britt to all. interrogations.
As a rule pugilists are inclined : to ibe
cross and peevish as an old maid; at a
proposal wheiy the day for carnage ap
proaches.' but not so James Edward Britt.
Of all the camp the. resourceful "Spider"
Kelly, adviser in. chief of \u25a0> the little Na
poleon of the ring, assumed a serious and
thoughtful air. â¢ .- * \u25a0 â¢
Britt spent a : good portion of the fore
noon'at the â¢ park handball courts, where
he curbed the ambitions of Trainer "Tiv"
Keeling at the Celtic?game. After .the
r.oon hour ' Jimmy indulged in his "beauty
sleep" until 3 :30 v o'clock." There were no
vacant seats in the gym when he began
work. Rope skipping for several minutes
set the ball In motion., 5 Following . this,
Jimmy punched the bag steadily for fully,
ten minutes/causing the perspiration to
flow freely from hU well knit frame. He
then mixed it fox three rounds with "Tiv",
Keeling, the '\u25a0 latter blocking : the ' fierce
drives of Jimmy with his gloves. The
medicine ball, shadow sparring, fpulley
weights, wrist machine, a cold; shower
bath and rubdown concluded the last day
of \u25a0 severe training.
Manager "Bill" 'Britt gave out Jimmy's
weight at 134 pounds. From* this the Cali
fornia boxer should experience no fdim^
culty in tipping the scales at 133: pounds
to-morrow at 1 o'clock, ;when he and Bat

BATTLING DANE
IS READY.
Indulges in LigHt
Gymy Stunts to
Limber Up.
All Battling Nelson did yesterday was
a.'- little 'light .work. in his gymnasium. He
isV through with his .boxing and, rough
stunts and will ju6t- keep j limbered sup
till \ the hour -of j battle is â¢at â¢ hand. v ter
going through- his~stunts yesterday after
noon he jumped b'n the scales and regis
tered just 134?4 pounds, which seemed to
satisfy, him. V. , . ;
The Dane .may ; be. a; bit worried over
the referee tangle, but If he is he surely
does not show it... Yesterday he stated he
would abide- by, the dtdslon of his man
ager, Billy Nolan, and added that what
ever the latter spid went ; double .with
him. Personally, he has â¢ nothing against
Jeffries, . and is sure the -big fellow will
give him an even break.
The Dane has acouired a hair cut . as
well as a clean shave and now he looks
about 100 per cent better. His face seems
to have lost the drawn look it had seyefal
days ago and he appears to be more him
self than on his arrival from Larkspur.
! There Is a bad scratch on the/ Dane's
; nose which bothers him. During his box
ing bouts the last few days \u25a0 his sparring
partners were sure to land, on the sore
place every time. The claret ran .In
streams and It made [ things uncomfort
able, j However, the wound Is about healed
now and the Dane says he is sure it will
be right by the 'time -he enters the ring
to-morrow afternoon. , v; '_'< -

TENNIS STARS

Sutton - Sisters Shine in
the Tournament on .the
Hotel Rafael Courts
PLAY WELL IN DOUBLES
With Sinsabaugh and Bral>;
as> Partners They Do
Not Lose a Single Set
-Play in the coast championship tennis
tournament at San Rafael .was confined
yesterday to mixed doubles. . As was ex
pected the teams from Southern Califor
nia J had,; no difficulty in carrying off the
honors. The- tournament was completed
to~ the' finals, the successful teams being
Miss _VJolet Sutton , and : Simpson Sinsa
baugb and Miss Florence. Sutton and Har
old - Braly. -Both teams went through
their; halves without losing a set and at
no time -were Uhey In danger of losing.
. Both.f? Sinsabaugh and Braly played
much better tennis than they did on the
previous day In the men's doubles. Braly
was not as nervous and | smashed and
drove .brilliantly., Sinsabaugh is, undoubt
edly the - best mixed ' doubles player on
the coast. He was as quick as a flash at
the net. Both "of the Suttons as- usual
gave their, respective partners good sup
port. \u25a0 Each of the successful teams fig
ured In a ; long deuce | set. In the first
round Braly and j Miss. Florence Sutton,
after , winning '..the' flrst set easily from
Miss Ryan and Herbert Schmidt, experi
enced considerable' difficulty winning the
second, set. Schmidt and Miss Ryan
fought desparately and, only after eight
een games ; had been played were Miss
Suttbri and Braly declared winners.
. The semi-final match, between Miss Vio
let Sutton -and â¢ Sinsabaugh and Mrs.
Bruce and Tracy. Crawford was onÂ© of
the best of. the day. Tne former team
won the first set easily and looked to
have a "safe" lead in the second. An'un
looked for . spurt on- tne part of Mrs.
Bruce and Crawford gave them a lead of
6-5" Miss Sutton and Sinsabaugh put up
a fast finish and- annexed the next three
games and -set.
The - longest match was that between
Miss Seymour and Â±tÂ» Nicnolson and Miss
Valleau and Harry Rolf e. The former
team won two sets but of three, but had
nothing to spare.
Miss Violet Sutton and Sinsabaugh and
Miss Dobbins and Percy aiurdock played
the cleverest exhibition. Although beaten
in straight sets, Miss Dobbins and Mur
dock were by no means outclassed. Both
sets were exceedingly close. ' .
The consolation doubles tournament
was anything but a success. The final
match, owing to the absence of Claude
Wayne, went to Nicholson ; and Sinsa
baugh by default. Summary :
Preliminary roundâ A. J. Gowan and Ml*
Peralta beat Miss Griffin and N. Baker by de
fault: Miss Florence Suttoa and Harold BrAdy
beat Mrs. Seymour and H. Schmidt, 8-3, 8-3.

*>n j of the Situation.
f*J. S. BACHE & CO.â The agreement of the
rcace envc>-6 was quite the most' Important
â¢vent niarketwise tbs-t has transpired this year.
It means the end of war that has exercised
pressure over the European markets for the
past eighteen months. It enables the Euro
pean financier to 'go a little freer, releases
laj-g** quantities of gold held in European cen
ters and permits the return of this money to
the ordinary channels of trade and commerce.
It leaves the way open for bull markets abroad.
London has btcn a consistent buyer of Amer
ican securities elnce peace was announced. The
decline this week has been due as much as
snything else to feare of a money stringency.
Every day hse seen the New Tork banks
loalac heavily to the Sub-treasury- If in ad
dition to this movement of money westward
there had bten a heavy indemnity to finance,
money would have reached much higher rates.
As the matter elands Japan, has probably BUf
fider.t moftey to wind up the war. Russia
may bring out a email additional' loan, but
It will not be offered until the crop- moving
I*riod is over.
HENRY CLEWSâ There has been a mod
erate calling in of Wall-etreet funds by banks
mare particularly identified with mercantile
Interests. These banks find an increased de
xnaid tor accommodation In their own pax
tlcuiar fields; they find manufacturers and
distributers making active preparations for a
year of unusual activity and prosperity. This
active end legitimate demand for money, being
simultaneous with the recall Â«Â»f funds from
New York by the Western and Southern banks,
could hardly have failed to provoke acute
stringency had the war settlement not been
en an ex-lndemnlty basis. The net result
fteems. therefore, that money accumulated .for
the payment of a possible indemnity will be
come In part available as a source of relief
to New York: and the weakness of sterling ex
change indicates that with any. substantial ad
vance 5n money rates here British sndi French
money woul<3 promptly become available, with
is,'.iew ol anticipating the large exports of
\u25a0ir erican products. As already intimated. thÂ«
V ; r-~canUle prospects of the country for a year
.-..â¢:!â¢! are highly satisfactory, and the indus
trial situation U not lees so. Steel rail manu
facturers have reaffirmed $2S as their price
for 100U and have already sold upward of
S'O.OOO ton* for delivery at that price In lÂ»03,
while price* of structural chapes have been
advanced $2 a ton. The copper metal market
Is showing signs of weakness, an Important
development being the resale of a round lot
of electrolytic by Chinese Interests to local
dealers at a severe concession in price. * This
coriH-r had not been shipped. The resale prob
ably reflects in an indirect way the with
drawal of demand incident to the termination
cf the war.

firm position, however, backed by the strong
ttatiFtical situation, end no inducements in
the way of concessions from quoted prices are
beln? held out to. Jobbers. Spot stocks of all
kinds are small and are finding a very good
outlet on small orders at full price. The
coast market for new crop Prunes for October
shipment is steadily advancing and. according
to advires by wire, it is becoming increasingly
difficult to buy 40s to 80s. inclusive, or any
as.Â«ortrnÂ»'nt within those b!z*>s on a 3%c f. o. b.
basis. Some jiackers have withdrawn from the
market as sellers at any price for the present,
and' others decline to entertain bids of any

Is predicted in tome quarters usually conserva

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Sept. 7. â There was further
heavy liquidation of stocks to-day following
that of yesterday and quite uniform declines of
between 1 and 2 points resulted in the course
of the first hour's trading. The market gave
evidence of being oversold and the perception
of this fact Induced" some renewed covering of
fhort contracts by the bears. The tone of the
market- became extremely uncertain and ' un
settled at the resulting rally in prices. The
taking of profits by the bears was due partly
to the fact that' some of the adverse factors in
tee day's news were anticipated in the selling
ef yeeterday. This was notably true in the
advance In minimum rate of discount by the
Bank of England, which was made to-day.
The usual wide Influence throughout the finan
cial wcrifi of a change of discount rate by that
Institution occurred nevertheless. No previous
chansre had been made since early in the epring
and it was not since September of two years
p-go that the interest rate charged by this in
fuentlal financial Institution had moved up-
Tee successive changes since that date
have been downward from 4 per cent , to the
2*Â£ per o*nt which ruled since- last spring
until to-day's advance to 3 per. cent. -The
active demand from Paris upon London for
cold and the lance engagements there for ship
ments to South America seem to be the imme
<3iete explanation for the action. Discounts
hardened In Berlin and Paris in response.
There was a ri*e in the early price for ex
change checks on London here, but a reaction
occurred later, under 'renewed offerings of
bankers' bills in the exchange market induced
by the continued hardening \u25a0. of money rates.
Call money rates went to above Z per cent and
th'r asking rates for time loans were advanced
ty many lenders. ThÂ» liquidation effected in
the stock market seemed nevertheless to have
relieved the money market to some extent and
the risintr tendency in Xew York exchange in
<-~hieagÂ». Indicated that the hltrber rates, for
money here were affecting the interior demand
upon thle center. The bÂ«li<f that tbe stock
merket liquidation had .- kept pace ' with the
neÂ»d of contraction of credits had tbe effect of
checking short selling by the bears. The call
by thÂ» ftat* Bank Commissioner at Albany
for a statement of condition of banks and trust
companies as of September 3 revealed another
requirement upon thoj money supply for the
building up of the cash re*erres of trust com
panies to prepare for. this _ quarterly require
ment. London's hardening " money market in
duced some large selling for account of that
center -which was an influence on the early
weakness here The effective recovery fol
lowed ' the cessation of business on foreign
Mock exchanges, . although the settlement â¢ of
the Moroccan Incident relieved the pressure
from foreign sources to some extent." The en
thusiastic reports from the steel trade of the
*al' k of steel rail* and other forms of rail
road', equipment for 1906 delivery made a sus
taining Influence, and served to steady the
I Tnited States " Steel stocks, the weakness â¢of
which was a â¢sensational Influence in unsteady-,
ing tfce market yesterday. Any purpose to
take action toward the money market was
disclaimed as an object of the visit of - the
Secretary of â¢ the Treasury to Wall street to
day. But the stock market community has
formed a-habit from the experience of several
yÂ«-Â«n= of: looking to special Treasury opera
-tions during the fall season for relief from old
entrenchments on the money market. A ; rally

DR. HOWE'S COMPANION

Dr. Robert C. Howe In bla

in sold coin rvhlch she ali-
Ktrnrted front a drawer In her
mother"!* liome Just prior to her
departure. Hone and Ktiena
have been on friendly terms
for iteveral tnonthK. They first"
\u25a0net at Slarlposa. Kdenn
thought Howe wnst Mingrle -at
that time. When the conple
retnrned to thin elty clandes
tine meetinfir* vi-ere kept np.
When iMonn discovered lloTre
was mnrried the couple decid
ed to leave town. Hone leaves
t>efalnd him a broken-hearted
wife and a beautiful little baby
daughter, both of whom are
left pennilentt by his departure.
Tbe whereabouts of the fleeing
parties tÂ» unknown. Detectives
are bunlly engrased working: up
the case.
Girl Steals Cash to
Aid Twain in
Flight
Helps Herself to
Her Mother's
Money.
When Dr. Robert C^Howe disappeared
from thi^ city last Saturday, the partner
of his flight, from all accounts, was beau
tiful Edena Troy.
This young woman, who is, but 19 years
old, had for a. long uxne been one of the
most attractive girls in the section of the
city in which she lived. She is possessed
of a graceful figure and lovely face. She
was always stylishly and richly dressed.
According to the statements of the
mother and the brother of Edena, Howe
has bt?en an admirer of the girl for many
months.
When the pair fled, they did not go
without coin, for Mrs. Troy states that
Edena helped herself to 5400 in gold coin
which Mrs. Troy had in a drawer in the
house. Hence the mother now mourns
the double loss of daughter and gold. The
whereabouts of the fleeing parties Is un
known to either the deserted wife, or to
the mother of the missing girl.
MET IX MARirOSA.
Howe and Edena first met at Mariposa
early this summer. Howe had gone there
to practice his profession, and Edena was
visiting friends there. They fell in love
at first sight. Howe, at the start, was
passing as a bachelor. He had only been
\u25a0in Mariposa a short time when his wife
advised him that she intended joining
him. This brought the love making in
Mariposa. to a sudden ending.
Howe and Edena at once came back to
town. Howe returned to his home at -135s
Alpine street, and Edena returned to the
home of h^r mother at 122 Scott street.
But icve overcomes obstacles and the
two kept up their clandestine meeting.
When Edena's mother was away in the
afternoon Howe would go to Edena's
home, and when anything would prevent
meetinffs Edena would go to the offlce
of Howe in the Barcelona building, cor
ner of O'Farrell and Larkin streets.
Early last week the couple decided that
they would better fly from town, so pre
parations were made for the departure
and late Saturday night they disappeared
from view.
PRAY* BESIDE MOTHER.
That same evening Edena had returned
home while her mother was in bed and
had knelt down beside her parent in pray
er and then retired to her room. That
was the last Mrs. Troy has seen of her
daughter. In the morning when she
awoke Edena was gone."
Mrs. Troy searched the city over,, but
in. vain: she' could not find her missing
child. On Tuesday a letter came from
the girl, postmarked San Jose. This
contained the! statement that she was
visiting friends there, and In addition
brought the Information that the J4OO
she had taken would be returned.
Mrs. Troy bied herself to San Jose
on Wednesday to hunt for her missing
daughter, and her money. She found
neither, although she searched thÂ» city
high and low. She visited every hotel
and boarding-house in the place, but
disappointment followed her search.
Mrs. Troy is congratulating herself,
however, that Edena did not take the
whole amount of cash, $750. which she
had hidden away in her home at the
time.
Mrs. Howe, the deserted wife of the le- I
vantlny doctor, is naturally greatly pros
trated over the crushing blow of the loss
of her husband, to whom she was deeply
attached. A* she sat in her home yester
day afternoon with her beautiful , little
babe, Lorella, in her arm*, she was the
picture of abject distress. Brushing away j
the tears she said, in a' voice faltering
with emotion: .

POLICE RECORD
AGAINST ELLIS
Suspected Park Highway
man, Known as Sampson,
Has Place in Criminal List
BLACK HAT IS FOUND
Headgear Siich as FoleyDe
scribecT Discovered in, I the
Alleged Eobber's Hoiise
..The police^were strengthened yesterday
in- their belief that the man who calls
himself William Sampson, but whose real
name is> probably â¢ William Ellis/; Is the
f ootpad'who ' attempted to hold up Harry
Foleyy the retired; pugilist. lnGplden Gate
Park on .Tuesday night by . the : discovery
that j Ellis; has r a criminal record.^ ;
\ .The i arrested man', is 5 said fto have -: as
sumed; the? name of ;,: Sampson, : which- is
,that:of 'his stepfather.'rWhen 17. years of
age he \u25a0 was arrested by; Detectives \ Ryan
and CDea with John Moy,* another youth,
on a' charge J of . petty . larceny j for ; stealing
some bridles â¢ from the ? Boston^ Dairy ,'-, in
December,' 1898.' -' The', dairy j, was at 5 that
time on. Howard ] street ; near, Fourth. ," \u25a0=.; He
and Moy .were eachv sentenced- to -\u25a0 serve
three * months in ' the > House of tCorrec
tion. He bore the name ;of.: William Kills
on.that. that occasion.','..,:'-- â¢â¢\u25a0\u25a0 ; :' \.\\ \ .
. : On February 18, 1902, Ellis waS arrested
by,' Policemen CConnell and McGee" on a
charge* of .burglary for breaking into I the
Central \u25a0 Theater and stealing a, pair.\of
opera glasses. The case was â¢ dismissed
by f Police Judge Conlan the following
May. The ; police say that Ellis' mother,
who at .that time kept a -lodging-house
at Eighth and Mission /streets,, paid the
value of J the stolen opera glasses, which
stopped the " prosecution. The name Che
gave then was William Allis... The-, police
say that; he was also implicated inthiev
ing lat ' the .warehouse , of the Dunham;
Carrigan and Hayden Company,' but there
was no prosecution. 1.
Detectives Bailey and Cody are" pursuing
their, investigations and expect to, have a
complete chain of circumstantial evidence
against Ellis and his wife before they end
their ; labors. One of the : most important
links -Is \the bullets in Ellis' ,; body. If it
is found to : be of 33 caliber the ! presump
tion will be ; strong that it came from
Foley's * weapon, which is â¢- of i that v size.
Another point that .the police depend upon
is - the fact ' that : the bullet ? entered . the
side of ; Ellis' shoulder/; If he had been
driving \u25a0 the buggy when he | received, the
shot it would, they. say. have - either en
tered in; front; or behind. V ;., \u25a0;:;\u25a0;\u25a0,.
"Foleyi will not be; asked to;have,a look
at " ; Ellis : till \ the / last . named is able to
walk. v It would not be a ; fair test, the
police say, to ask him, to. identify- Ellis
while the alleged highwayman is lying
on \u25a0 a cot at \ the hospital. 5 Policeman Foley ,
who saw a : woman drive : past him in a
buggy i about four minutes after he j heard
the report of.the shots, had a look at Mrs.
Ellis' in the City; Prison yesterday, but he
could not identify her. " He said it was
too "dark at the. time for him to discern
the woman's . features. - ,".
i Acting; Captain of Detectives Reynolds
ha 3 been i firm in the belief from tneflrst
that ii Ellis, utilized the buggy â¢_ and took
along his wife' and child to avert suspicion
after committing the holdup.; If. Foley
had :< beeh , as pliant as "the other victims,
no : suspicion would have attached \u25a0 to > a
man";driving in a. buggy ;;.wlth his i wife
aiid: child. .^Detective f Ãailey ? yesterday
f oifnd : a .soft i black * hat* in .the ; room : oc
cupied by, Ellis and \u25a0 his s wife at ,759 How
ard street, which answers "the , description
given by ; Foley of :] the ; one : his ; assailant
wore. "Ellis said he wore ' a ; soft gray,; hat
that night ana : did not own ; a* black tone.'

forth.against the San Francisco Gas and

J. â¢ Roach,' one of the attorneys for the
plaintift. -The question was at first stren
uously .;â¢ objected to by Attorney George

quickly withdrew, the objection.
None of the veniremen questioned seem
ed particularly, familiar with ; Rockefeller
nor .werei any of /their: safes â¢ tainted with
Standard ; Oil â¢ stock. A jury was. easily
secured " In the morning.- "The \u25a0 following

- i Roach's question >is based oh 'a ' rumor
to the effect .that the oil magnate has be

When \the query -was first made the
hangersbn in 1 Judge Graham' 3 courtroom
began Â» to titter. Roach insisted on the
question," however. It .developed "that
