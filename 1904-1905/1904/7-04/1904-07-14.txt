ARMOUR VISITS THE YARDS.
The packing house Inspectors did not
appear to share the alleged fear /of
mobs. J. Ogden Armour went alone for
a tour of the stock yards. He was rec
ognized all along the way by strikers;
but met with no demonstration.
One-'of the most interesting state
ments made to-day regarding the
strike situation came from 'Miss Mary
E. McDowell, of the University of Chi
cago settlement, near the stock yards.
She said that the greatest difficulty the
union workmen had to expect was that
presented by the "casual worker," who,
she . said, was at the beck and call of
the plant superintendents.. There are
about. 5000 of '. this class, of laborers
around the yards looking for work, and
the: regular workmen are in constant
fear they will. be supplanted. Many of
these workers are now, it is sald^being
engaged to take; places of the strikers.
Miss McDowell ; remarked :
â¢ "I do 'not -expect serious trouble un-
To-day bore out predictions of the
packing house proprietors that the big
strike would not causa a stoppage of
operations. In the great abattoirs
things moved slowly, indeed, but
they moved. Â¦ ..
In all the packing houses some ani
mals were being slaughtered. Every
department was said to be doing some
thing, and was expected to increase
the activity, to-morrow. Loading and
shipping were . In progress, though
heavily curtailed, as was the buying of
cattle. Hundreds of workmen were
hired and put at work in the places
which had been vacated by thousands.
On the other hand, the strike spread
somewhat by. the action of the team
sters, In considerable numbers, but os
tensibly acting as individuals, who re
fused to handle product touched by
newly hired non-union workers. This
refusal was usually based on the time
honored plea 'that a different course,
contracts . notwithstanding, would - put
the teamster in peril of his life.
Extensive installments of sleeping
cots and cooking apparatus for strike
breakers at the various packing houses
were apparently the main Irritant cause
for action by the teamsters, although
there were a number of sporadic mob
outbreaks on a small scale.
The initial step toward a settlement
of the controversy by mediation was
taken late this evening by the State
Board of Arbitration. When the mem
bers of the board reached Chicago they
at once went into conference with
Michael J. Donnelly, the leader of the
strike, and listened to the story of his
side- 'of the trouble. The members of
the board then interviewed the repre
sentatives of the packers and their
side of the controversy was heard. As
a result of these -two conferences, Don
nelly sent a â¢ communication to the
packers In which it was stated that the
unions were willing to accept a set
tlement through a board of arbitration.
No reply is expected from the employ
ers before to-morrow, ' but It is confi
dently expected that their reply will be
conciliatory, because they offered to ar
bitrate the matter in dispute before the
strike was called.
Donnelly declared to-night that the
offer of arbitration from' the packers
had not reached him before the strike
was called and that if the packers will
again make : the , same proposition it
would be accepted by the unions.
PLANTS ARE NOT CLOSED.
CHICAGO, July 13.â Arbitration of
the grievances which precipitated the
general strike in the meat packing
houses in various parts of the country

forty refrigerator cars.
The Admiralty regards the naval
situation as greatly improved and

showing signs of exhaustion. The of

Â¦with the knowledge that he will have
to fight without the co-operation of
the army in storming Port Arthur, has
become extremely cautious about risk
ing his ships and that at present he
will undertake operations of only sec
ondary importance, like a pursuit of

The original report had reached St.
Petersburg last night in the form of a
newspaper dispatch from Mukden and
was received with incredulity but at
about noon, when Vice Admiral
Alexieff telegraphed the news to the
general staff, it created a tremendous
impression. It was immediately trans
mitted to the Official Messenger and a
few minutes afterward -the newsboys
were racing- through the streets, elec
trifying the crowds with; the tidings.
The boys we're fairly mobbed by per
sons eager to buy the extras.
The members of the general staff do
not offer explanations of what Ad
miral Alexieff means by "Japanese
sources." but they declare that the
Viceroy would not have officially re
ported such important news unless it
had reached him from sources entirely
worthy of credence. At the same time,
they say the report should be accepted
with reserve; pending the ' receipt of
more definite advices. In support of. the
report, however,, they point out, that
Jhe date coincides with the second at
tempt of Admiral Togo's torpedo-boat
"According to information derived
from Japanese sources and received by
Admiral AlexiefTs military staff, the
Japanese attacked the Russian posi
tion at Port Arthur during the night
of July 10. They were, repulsed with
enormous losses. It is difficult to cal
culate even approximately the number
of Japanese casualties, which amount
ed. It is said, to the immense figure of
30,000." -
. -There was great interest throughout
St. Petersburg all this evening for
further details of the disaster. It has
.developed that the official report, which
was at nr6t suppdsed to emanate di
rectly from Viceroy Alexieff, was not
epeclficaHy fathered by. him, but was
given out as a report reaching his
headquarters from "Japanese sources."
What . these sources are has not yet
been explained. Possibly the report
was intercepted by wireless telegraph;
but it is more likely that it came from
the Russian Consul at Chefu or the
Russian at Tientsin. A full
report from .Lieutenant General Stoes
sel, commander of the military forces
at Port Arthur, is awaited.
The general staff to-day gave out the
following: . . |
. i'Kews has been received from re
liable sources ihat the Japanese third
army' on the night of July 11 attacked
Port .Arthur and was heavily defeated,
'an'lmmense number* being 1 killed by

If the report of the loss of 30,000 Jap

of such a reverse and follow it up.
LONDON, July 14.â The special dis
patches from correspondents at the
seat of war published in this morn
ing's London newspapers do not give
any confirmation of the sensational re
ports of the Japanese losses at Port
Arthur.
The loss of 50,000 of the besiegers in
an attack against fortifications with
guns in position and the approaches
sown with mines is considered quite
within the range of possibility, if the
Japanese, as on other occasions, storm
ed the fortifications with their ac
customed recklessness, especially if the
mines were exploded under masses of
men. The general staff already had in
formation that the besiegers had occu
pied Takushan Hill, three miles north
east of the harbor, but adds that the
Japanese were unable to hold the posi
tion.

is true that Togo does not mention a
land attack, but this is not in his
province.

PARIS, July 13.â A remarkable case
In which George A. Church of Nayatt
Point, R. I., is the central figure, is
being heard by the tribunal of the
Seine. M. Poulet, a wealthy Parisian
capitalist, disappeared fourteen years
ago during a voyage around the world.
He left $260,000 in French bonds. After
waiting the statutory period his heirs
asked for a division of the estate.
Thereafter a will was filed, dated Slm-
Than-Glaia, Island of Java. January
23, 1&00, in which M. Poulet gave his
entire estate to George A. Church.
Counsel for the heirs sought to create
the impression that this was another
case of mythical Crawfords, as in tho
Humbert case, while counsel for
Church maintained that his client act
ually exists; being a retired New Eng
land merchant, who recently sailed
from New York for Europe.
Thereupon the court asked that
Church be presented to the court and
adjourned the case until Friday to per
mit the presentation or production of
other proofs of his Identity.
PROVIDENCE. R. I., July 13.â
George A. Church, named in Paris dis
patches as a claimant of the property
of M. Poulet, a Parisian capitalist, was
for many years a resident of Nayatt
Point, near this city. He belongs to
an old Rhode Island family, and Is
nearly 60 years of age.
For several years he has spent his
time in European travel, and during
one of his trips made the acquaintance
of Poulet. The two became intimate
friends and about fourteen years ago
the Parisian visited Church at hiÂ«
Rhode Island home. It was shortly
after this that Poulet started on his
trip around the world, during which he
died at Buenos Ayres.

the real reason for the refusal of the

fact that a number of "Irresponsible

dent of the Associated Press saw
enough to Justify the estimate that the
Russians had more than 200 men killed
or wounded and that the Japanese
casualties*" prtfbably ""would amount to
60. ; The. Russians left 30 dead In front
of and in the trench. where the attack
began. At^ this point they had an equal
number of\ men severely wounded and
the Japanese took several prisoners
and captured 100 rifles. The Russians
were seen carrying away two officers
who had been either killed or wounded.
SURPRISED BY RUSSIANS.
Motien Pass opens upon a funnel
shaped slope which rises for a quarter
of a mile from the valley and which is
flanked by hills. Thirty-six Japanese
were quartered in a Chinese house near
the bottom of the hftl and two com
panies of Japanese soldiers were in a
trench a hundred yards long, located
on the summit of the hill, which com
manded the approach. Two other com
panies of soldiers slept near this
trench.
Between 3 and 4 o'clock in the morn
ing, in complete darkness and with a
heavy fog enshrouding tne hills, two
battalions of the Tenth and Twenty
fourth East Siberian Regiments, to
gether with, one hundred cavalrymen,
approached the Japanese position.
They surrounded the pickets and the
outposts In the house and gained a po
sition from which to rush the trench.
Several other Russian companies were
so disposed that they could attempt a
flanking movement on both the Japan
ese right and left.
"When the fighting began the build
ing where the outposts were quartered
became a slaughter-house. The Jap
anese, aroused from their sleep by the
enemy, seized their swords and bay
onets to resist the attack. The Rus
sians were at such close quarters with
the Japanese that. it was imporsible for
the latter to use /their rifles.
HAND-TO-HAND FIGHTING.
The first fighting in the trench. arijl
in front of the 7 trench was hand , to

self he stood out in strenuous opposi
tion to annexation and for the inde
pendence of the Transvaal, as guaran
teed by the Sand River convention of
1S52. To Sir Bartle Frere he appeared
always obdurate on rfiis point, always
saying: "We want our country back;
we will take nothing less than our
country, and will not rest day or night
until we set 'it."
; He was a leading spirit in the revolt
of 1880-81 and took an active part in
the direction of affairs at the battle of
Majuba Hill, where, the British were
disastrously defeated and compelled to
make a peace, conceding the inde
pendence, of the Transvaal.
In 1S76 he was elected Vice 'President,
which office he held until the annexa
tion of the Transvaal was proclaimed
in behalf of Great Britain by Sir
Theophilus Shepstone in 1ST".- 'i-j: s '.-%

during the civil war of 1860 and bjr his
bravery, quick action and skill brought
the struggle to a close.
.In 1S59, under the Presidency of Von

forces, when engaged in war with the
Kaffirs and other, tribes, and in' the

Continued From Page'l, Column 7.
COACHES AKE DEMOLISHED.
Between Chicago Heights and Glen
wood there is a sharp curve and as the
picnic train tore around this on ihe
southbound track the freight train was
backing southbound to the northbound
track. It was partly on both tracks
and no train could have passed it in
either direction. The bend is so sharp
that the engineer of the picnic train
had no chance to see the freight be
fore he was upon it. It was too late
to do anything but apply the 'air
brakes, but before they could take ef
fect the passenger tra'in smashed into
the freight at full speed. The engine
and baggage car of the passenger went
clear through the freight and were
Tiled up in a heap of wreckage on the
further side of the switch, on which
the freight was crossing from one track
to the other. The first coach of the
picnic train plunged straight into the
wreckage and buried itself in a mass
of kindling wood under the demolished
baggage car.
Nearly all of the passengers in the
first coach were caught beneath the
mass of debris, and It was here that
the loss of life occurred. The passen
gers In the rear coaches were hurled
from their seats and many of them
were badly shaken and bruised, but all
of the serious casualties occurred In
the first car.
IIKIiD DOWN* BY WRECKAGE.
The uninjured passengers and train
men at once hastened to the relief of
thoSe who were pinned down under the
wreckage, who were shleklng plteously
for aid. The scene of the wreck is two
miles from any station and much delay
ensued before some of the injured who
were held down by heavy timbers could
be extricated. Nothing could be done
for them until lifting machinery came
from Chicago Heights.
Men were sent running along the
tracks to both Chicago Heights and
Glenwood for aid and in a short time
trains bearing physicians and supplies
for the wounded were on their way
from both stations. The first train to
arrive on the scene was from Chicago
Heights and carried six physicians. A
short time afterward a second train ar
rived from Glenwood, bringing addi
tional physicians and a number of
nurses.
Darkness had fallen when the second
train arrived and the work of rescue
and relief went on by the light of huge
bonfires that were built along the side
of the track. A regular relief train waa
made up at Glenwood as soon as possi
ble and every preparation made to
bring,- the dead and injured to the city.
It was nearly 10 o'clock when the last
of the injured had been taken from the
wreckage and a half hour later than
that time when ' the temporary dress-"
ing had been applied to the last wound
and the train, carrying its woeful bur
den, started for the city.
Because the first train had blocked
the rightful track the excursion train
switched to the southbound track to
run for four miles until . it should
have passed the station at Glenwood.
Just north of Chicago Heights. As it
tore along the track at the rate of
forty miles an hour it rounded a
sharp curve and came full upon the
second train, which was backing up
on the southbound track In order to
take up its lost cars and trying at the
same time to keep out of the way of
the coming picnic train, which it be
lieved was on the northbound track.
There was no time for more than the
setting of the brakes, when, with un
slackened- speed, the train with its
load of 500 men, women and children
crashed Into the freight. There was
a shock, a shriek and more than
twenty souls were in enternity.

VALLEJO, July 13.â Considerable In
terest is beginning to develop over the
election of officers of the Grand Coun
cil of the Young Ladies* Institute,
which is holding its twelfth session
here this week. It has been given out
that Miss May Stein does not desire
re-election as grand president^ as she
feels that the labors of the term now
closing have been too arduous for her.
Still she has received many requests
to accept another term and assurances
of strong support. In the event of her
declining a second term First Grand
Vice President Miss C. A. Terry of San
Francisco is in line for promotion.
There promises to be a spirited con
test for the office of grand director.
Eleven are to be elected and it is un
derstood that there are at least twenty
candidates tor the positions. The elec
tion "will be held next Saturday.
Among the pleasant social features
of the week was the presentation of an
exquisite cut glass vase to Grand Presi
dent Miss May Stein, silver scent bot
tles to Past Grand President Miss A.
M. Potthoff and Grand Secretary and
Treasurer Miss J. T. Malloy. and a gold
brooch to Miss Lizzie McGuire, who is
at the head of the local committee of
arrangements. The gifts were from
Vallejo Council No. 13, Y. L. I.
The sesHon of the Grand Institute
this morning was devoted entirely to
the exemplification of the ritual.
Changes and Improvements were sug
gested and considered. The report of
the grand president. MIss : May Stein,
will be presented on Thursday and is
awaited with much interest.
The story of Paul Kruger's life,
aside from his career as a soldier and
statesman, is full of adventure and
daring such as the brains of the fiction
writers and story makers could hard
ly imagine. In the conquest of Natal,
the Orange Free State and lastly the
Transvaal from the blacks and the
wild beasts he bore a foremost and
fearless part.
President Kruger was a deeply re
ligious man. His early education,
hke that of other Boer boys, as far as
books -were concerned, consisted in
writing, figuring and reading. The
Bible was literally "the book" in every
family and while yet a young man he
knew it from beginning to end and
believed in it literally. He was one
of the regular preachers of the "Dop
per" church in Pretoria, to which he
belonged.
values of coin and -bullion, but that
has since been proved to be without
foundation.
Paul Kruger was married in 1842
to Miss Maria du Pleasis, a young
woman of French extraction from
south of the Vaal River. They lived
happily together until 1891. -when his
wife died.
To-day the Supervisors granted a
special privilege of twenty-three
months to Harry L. Shannon of San
Francisco, representing the power
company, to maintain a pole line
throughout the county and also grant

CHICAGO. July 13.â Twenty-two
members of the Sunday school of Do
remus Congregational Church at Thir
ty-first and Butler streets went to their
death this evening with joy in their
hearts and a hymn on their lips. Sev
enty persons, mostly children, mem
bers of the same Sunday school, were
maimed and mangled at the same time.
The carnage occurred in a cc-llision on
the tracks of the Chicago and Eastern

Richard Meehan, a boatman, was sit
ting on his scow when he saw a body
which was clad in a heavy winter over
coat. He called a policeman- and when
the body was towed ashore the identi
fication was made by the clothing, jew
elry, baggage cljeck and general de
scription, which corresponded with data
In the reward circular distributed
broadcast offering $10-000 for informa
tion leading to Kingsley's whereabouts
or for the recovery of his body. All
his jewelry, his papers, 590 in
money and even his tobacco and
match boxes were found just ""as
he carried them the last time he
was seen by his cousin, Baxter, who
has prosecuted search for his cousin
unremittingly. In a wallet containing
money there were three membership
card3 of the New York Athletic Club
made out in the name of Henry Bax
ter Kingsley.
The body was taken to Harlem
Morgue. Baxter is in Maine and Alex
ander T. Mason, his lawyer, has gone
to London to visit his mother, so the
body was not claimed to-night.
In addition to the" articles described
in the reward circular there were found
on. his body a silver tobacco box marked
"Father from Nahum and Ada'* and
an open-face gun metal watch marked
"C. S. K."
All sorts of theories have been ad
vanced, to account for the disappear
ance, but the theory that he had fallen
among thieves is actually disproved by
the finding of the body with all . the
valuables undisturbed.
NEW YORK, July 13.â Floating in

Shortly after 1 o'clock this morn
ins Special Officer Hilbush found a
woman, apparently about 60 years of
age, lying unconscious on the side
walk at the corner of Clay and Locust
streets. She was Immediately con
veyed to the Park Hospital, where it
was discovered that she was suffering
from a lacerated wound on the head,
concussion of the brain and a possible
fracture of the skull.
"When the woman was found her
clothes were badly disarranged and
torn and there was evidence that
she had been roughly handled before
being rendered unconscious by a blow
on the head. No money or valuables
were found on her person, although her
clothes indicated that she was a wo
man in comfortable circumstances.
In the woman's Docket was found an
envelope addressed to Mrs. H.* M. Gar

Jphn Peterson was terribly burned
and scalded yesterday morning in a
pickle factory at 653 Chestnut street
by burning alcohol and boiling water.
The unfortunate man, who is night
foreman, had just turned boiling wa
ter into a tank and as he did so passed
near the preserving vats. He had an
open light in his hand and the flame
of this caused the alcohol tanks to
become ignited. He was suddenly
enveloped in a sheet of flame and,
falling down, rolled under the stream
of boiling water.
His injuries are very serious and
there is little hope for his recovery.
He was removed to the Central Emer

Charge Against Wilkes Is Dismissed.
isAN JOSE, July 13. â A charge of
obtaining money under false pre
tenses against Paul T. Wilkes. the
former husband of Mrs. Leroy Jones,
who figured in a sensational disap
pearance in New York a couple of
months ago, was dismissed by Justice
Davison this morning. He was ac
cused of passing a worthless sight
draft, and it was subsequently learned
that the paper was genuine.
. The victims were instructed to begin
their duties April 25 in the afternoon,
and when ..they, arrived rt the office
of. C. C. Lawrence & Co. ;n the Scho
field building in Cleveland on that aft
ernoon the company had fled, and
shortly thereafter a man who held a
chattel mortgage on the office furni
ture came and carted away everything,
THEY GO TO WORK.
The testimony of Lewis, Lange, Mul
der and Morris Jr. was practically the
Bame. AH answered an advertisement
In the Cleveland newspapers, stating
that "a gentleman." being compelled
by age and impaired eyesight to retire
from business, would sell his half in
terest in a business which was paying
from 56000 to 510.000 per annum, the
selling price to be 523D0 cash. No ex
perience was necessary, the advertise
ment stating that the remaining part
ner would instruct the new man as to
his duties.. The firm was that of C. C.
Lawrence & Co., general brokers, real
estate agents, etc. All with the excep
tion of Lange and Morris paid 52500 for
the half interest, each believing himself
to be the only purchaser. Lange paid
5950 cash, and not being able to secure
the balance gave his note to the pris
oner, allowing the remainder of the
purchase money to be taken out of thÂ«*
profits of the business. Morris paid
5800 and remained In the office ten
days. The firm was not doing any
business. j N">
The other complaint charges him
with having defrauded several persons
in this city in 1901. At that time Carle
ton occupied offices In the Emma
Spreckels building in this city under
the name of Herbert Carleton & Co.
and employed a large number of young
men as collectors, requiring them at
the same time to deposit 5500 each as
security for their honesty. After they
left the money Carleton & Co. disap
peared, taking the coin. The prisoner
had with him at that time a good look
ing young woman who was known as
his wife,' and acted as the cpmpany's
typewriter, and a young man who act
ed as his secretary. Mrs. Carleton and
this man were present in court yester
day.
FOUR, DUPES AT ONCE. -
CRIMINAL RECORD HERE.
Detective Edward Gibson of this city
was also in court armed with two war
rants for Carleton's arrest to be served
in case of his release. The complaint
on which the first warrant was Issued
charges Carleton with being a. fugitive
from Justice from the city .of . New
York. It appears that the prisoner
was convicted in that city and sen
tenced to four years'- imprisonment in
the Sing Sing penitentiary for steal
ing 5680. He took an appeal, was re
leased on bonds and escaped.
Four victims of Charles H. Carleton,
alias Herbert Carleton, alias C. C.
Lawrence, confronted that alleged con
fidence crook yesterday morning in
United States Commissioner HeacocK's
court. Carleton was tne subject of ju
dicial inquiry as to whether he should
be removed to Cleveland, Ohio, for trial
on a charge of having used the mails
to defraud the four victims. The vic
tims, Robert D. Lewis, Clamor H.
Lange, Frank E. Mulder and Isaac
Morris Jr., all of Cleveland, Ohio, were
â¢In court, having been brought to this
city by the long arm of Uncle Sam.
Carleton, Carrao and George Harris,
alias F. G. Edwards, were confeder
ates.
Franklin K. Lane and John H. Mar
ble, counsel for the defendant, an
nounced that they would not put in
any evidence. Lane raised the point
that the complaint found in Cleveland,
Ohio, and the complaint drawn in this
city were not the same. Some of the
allegations differed In both complaints,
and Lane argued that they charged
two entirely different crimes.
Judge Heacock remarked that the
Assistant District Attorney had not
yet explained why the nam . of the vic
tim used in the foreign complaint was
not the same as in the complaint made
In this city, which contained four
names. Judge Heacock said that if Mc-
Klnley would ask for leave to amend
the complaint he would grant him time.
McKinley remarked that he would
make the request for leave to file an
amended complaint, and the matter
went over until 9:30 a. m. to-day.
Judge Heacock remarked that he
would probably hold the prisoner for
removal, the evidence having showed
that he had committed . three separate
offenses against the postal laws of the
United States.
This ended the testimony on behalf of
the Government introduced by Assist
ant United States Attorney Ben L. Mc-
Klnley and Postoffice Inspector James
O'Connell. '
TO CORRECT AN ERROR.
Morris was formerly stenographer
and telegrapher for the Carnegie Steel
Company. His contract with Law
rence differed from that of the others.
He was to receive $100 per month from
the firm of Lawrence & Co. and one
half of Edwards' commission for the
sale of stocks.
leaving the four dupes shivering on the
threshold. Mulder wanted to begin on
the niorning of that day his duties as
the half of the firm, but on the pre
ceding day Lawrence gave him a com
mission to go to a neighboring town on
the morning of April 25 to examine a
stock of hardware that was for sale.
He did not return until the afternoon
and after Carleton and his confeder
ates had fled.

Judge Parker to-day received notifi

District Attorney Byington in speak
ing yesterday of the attack upon him
by Attorney Eddy during the inquest
on the body of Mrs. George Curry.who
was shot and killed by her husband,
defended his action In. takiner a state
ment from Curry and said that every
criminal would be interviewed when
arrested by a representative of his of
fice. If he had the time he would do
so personally and if he had another
deputy in his office he would specially
assign him to do that work.
The District Attorney says he would
like to have in his office two Intelli
gent men, whose duty would be to
cross-examine all people arrested on
criminal charges.
"I think," he said, "it is criminal
for an official to sit back until a per
son charged with crime has time to
prepare a false story, to fix witnesses
and plan a cunning defense. The
course to be pursued is to interview
the defendant immediately after the
commission of the crime and to pro
cure statements from all witnesses. If
a link is overlooked at the beginning
it is* frequently lost forever."

SAN JOSE, July 13. â A divorce suit
filed to-day by Claude Simpson
against Christiana Simpson recalls
the suicide of Edward S. Johnston, a
saloon-keeper, on April 8, 1D03. At
that time Mrs. Simpson was posing us
the wife of Johnston. Simpson in the
divorce proceedings charges his wife
with extreme cruelty and intemper
ance, and that in November, 1902. her
acts were such that she caused him to
leave his home. There is one child,
five years old, Ernest C. Simpson,
whom he has always had the care of,
and he asks for the child's custody.
For some months before Johnston
killed himself Mrs. Simpson had
openly declared she was the wife of
Johnston, saying that the ceremony
was performed by a Catholic clergy
man. After the suicide she stuck to
the story, but it was shown to be
false.

As neither of the conditions had
been complied with Golden was com
pelled to dismiss the suit. The salary
demand will still remain tied up until
other court proceedings to determine
the construction of the law are insti
tuted.
Judge Golden ordered the salary
warrant produced in court and ascer
tained that it was made out in favor
of Simpson, who claimed exemption
from the judgment on the ground that
the salary was required for his sup
port and that of his family. Golden
ruled that the Jurisdiction of the court
in the case depends upon the payment
of the amount of the demand into the
court or upon some means of getting
it.
Justice of the Peace Golden yester
day dismissed the case of Charles
Trull against James Simpson on the
ground that the court has no jurisdic
tion. Trull, as assignee of Bier & Re
gensburger, sued Simpson, who is
chief deputy tax collector, for $175
on a promissory note. Trull had ob
tained a judgment against Simpson
and under the new law filed a tran
script thereof and Treasurer McDou

demand for one month.

the President devoted considerable time
to exercise about the Sagamore Hill
grounds. A favorite exercise of the
President is chopping wood and he in
dulges in this every day. It serves to
keep down his weight and he enjoys
it more than any other of his diver
sions except horseback riding.
Concerning the visit to Oyster Bay
yesterday the committee representing
the Central Labor Union of Lack
awanna and Luzerne counties, Pa., Sec
retary Loeb to-day received the follow
ing telegram from John E. Barrett,
editor of the Truth of Scranton, Pa.:
"Did President Roosevelt personally
refuse to see a committee of miners
yesterday, as reported in this morning's
papers?"
In response to this inquiry, Secretary
Loeb sent to Editor Barrett the follow
ing telegram:
"Many thanks for your telegram. The
committee came here and insisted on
seeing the President to present a pe
tition at a time when I could not ar
range- it for them. The President did
not know they were here. If they had
sent word that they desired to see the
President I should have been glad to
arrange for them at some convenient
time. As it was, I offered to bring the
petition to the personal attention of
the President. Thevstatement that
the President had any knowledge of
the committee's presence in Oyster Bay
is not true."
Dr. Rowell is quite confident of Sen
ator Bard's re-election to the United
States Senate. He bases his belief on
expressions of public sentiment
throughout the State, and on the .fur
ther belief that corporate influences
will not be employed to set aside
the will of the majority of Republican
voters.
Incidentally the remark was made
in Senator Bard's room last night that
the contest might be further enlivened
by the introduction of another candi
date in the person of Frank H. Short
of Fresno. It is gossip in political cir
cles that definite announcement of
Short's intentions will soon be made.
The supporters of Senator Bard do
not manifest any alarm over the ad
vent of new candidates, but solace
themselves with the reflection that a
large field of aspirants will promote
rather than hinder the success of the
present Senator.
Referring to the battle in Ventura
County he said, in answer to inquiries:
"My friends are sanguine of success
there and in other counties of Southern
California."
The Senator is quite well satisfied
uith the situation from a Senatorial
puint of view. Recent declarations of
leading men in support of his candi
dftcy for another term in the United
States Senate afford him special pleas
ure. He was asked last night what he
thought of George A. Knight's proposi
tion against instruction by county con
ventions and frankly replied: "The
Mibject of instruction should in my
opinion be left wholly with the people,
if popular sentiment in favor of an
aspirant for the United States Senate
is pronounced, the county conventions
or nominating bodies should give ex
pression to the wishes of the people."
In a general way the introduction of
Frank P. Flint and George A. Knight
as candidates for the favor of the peo
ple was discussed and the fact was
dwelt upon that the Senatorial contest
was exceptionally free from bitterness.
Senator Bard spoke hfghly of his com-
IÂ»etitors and predicted that the Legis
lature would be Republican by a large
majority.
Senator Bard received many callers
at the Occidental Hotel last evening
and will doubtless meet many of the
influential citizens of the metropolis to
day. Before returning south he will
visit Sacramento.
United States Senator Thomas R.
Bard, accompanied tfy Dr. Chester
Kouell of Fresno, arrived in the city
last evening from the south and regis
tered at the Occidental Hotel. Dr.
Kowell joined the Senator at San Jose
yesterday morning. During the day
many of the leading men of the Santa
Clara Valley called at the Hotel Ven
dome and paid their respects to Sena
tor.Bard. The Interchange of greetings

After some hesitation the witness re
plied that it was because he had heard
the land now rented at from $10 to $12
an acre. The case will be continued
this morning.
Charles Schirmer, who for twelve
years was assessor in Solano County,
but has not held that position for six
years, testified that the land formerly
owned by the Eppingers on Ryers Isl
and consisted of about 2000 acres and
is worth 5100 an acre.
"What did you assess it for?" asked
District Attorney Byington.
"The amounts varied during different
years from $5 to $25 an acre."
"Why, then, do you suddenly Increase
the valuation fourfold?"
Attorney Ach In a dazed and hopeless
manner as though for a cue the wit
ness said he was no bookkeeper and
did not know the meaning of several
peculiar entries in the book. He was
then excused and an expert will go
over the book.
When the cross-examination began
the witness admitted that one invoice
of $31,000 was for goods bought instead
of sold, but he passed it off lightly as
"a mere error in bookkeeping." This,
however, opened the way for a series of
similar questions and after looking: at
During the course of the opening
statement Ach sarcastically referred to
Colonel Beck as the "new head of a
foreign bank who was anxious to get
business and make a record for him
self.". He then called to the stand Cal
vin Langton, former grain sampler and
confidential clerk for the Epplngers.
During his direct examination by Ach
all went as smoothly as an automobile
on an asphalt road 'before the gasoline
tank starts to leak, but the leak mani
fested itself when the cross-examina
tion began. Langton took the cargo In
voice book and, prompted by Ach, read
off what purported to be a list of sales
made by Eppinger & Co. during the
last year totaling $4,690,419, the object
of this being to impress the Jury, as
to the magnitude of the firm.
PECULIAR BOOKKEEPING.
We will show that Ettlinger Is not at pres
ent in this State and has not been here since
January; that Jacob Eppinger has not re
ceived a line, from him since his departure
and he did not even say good-by to his old
business associate.
We will summon experts to testify as to
the physical condition of the defendant, who
started out as a butcher boy In this city In
1S55 and by his own enerjry worked up a busi
ness aggregating; millions. Two years ago
Dr. Herzsteln. who Is now In Europe*, ordered
this aged man, this arch conspirator as he has
been painted, to rive up his business entirely
and allow the. work to fall on the shoulders
of the younger* members of the firm or he
might drop dead at any moment. Following
this advice he kept away from the office and
Bernard Ettllnter became the chief manipu
lator.
DEFENDANT'S HEALTH.
Ach first referred to the mass of tes
timony which had been brought before
the jury, much of which he claimed did
not bear directly on the case, but was
introduced merely to confuse the ju
rors. He continued: '
You have been led into a mystic maze and
tt is my duty to extricate you from that maze
and aid you in determining whether or not
Jacob Epplnger is guilty of the charges made
apatnst him In this indictment. The only
question for you to consider is whether or
not he is guilty of the specific charge of ob
taining the sum of $9300 from the Inter
national Banking Corporation . by false pre
tenses. Much evidence has been introduced
to show complicity in parallel offenses, but
they are not at issue.
I will not go into the mass of testimony
which contains matter foreign to this case.
If you believe he was not in the bank man
aged' by Colonel Beck on the 10th day of
April, 1903, and that he did not sign the
promissory note on the 14th of April it will
be your duty to acquit him.
We can and will put witnesses on the stand
to show that the firm did a business in round
numbers of $18,000,000 a year.
Â¦ We will show that the firm from October 1,
1902. to April. 14. 1003, paid oft* $500,000 on
its indebtedness, and during the succeeding
six months .$100,000.
We will show that in April of 1003. the
time the money was borrowed, assets ex
ceeded its liabilities to the extent of $1,400,
000. and had property in Solano County worth
over $200,000. Further than this the screen
ings, or as counsel for the prosecution termed
them, "chicken' feed" taken possession of by
tho receiver in June 'sold for $102,000 net.
Hugh McFaul, formerly a weigher at
the warehouse, was recalled to the
stand and questioned regarding lots of
wheat and their -shipment. He testi
fied that in the r.jnths of March and
April, 1903, there were no 'F" lots of
wheat in the warehouse. He never
knew of any other wheat being shipped
for Al white wheat, but had seen sub
stituted some rejected and good wheat
from lots other than that called for.
Tliis closed the case for the people and
an adjournment was taken until 2
o'clock, when Attorney Ach made his
opening statement.
Jacob Eppinger appeared in the
courtroom early, accompanied by his
wife and two sons. His face showed
no signs of the ravages of the terrible
malady from which he was supposedly
suffering from the past two days, and*
his eye was brighter and step firmer
than at any time during the trial.
Heretofore he has left the courtroom
leaning heavily on the arms of his two
sons, but yesterday he required the as
sistance of Morris only and apparently
could easily have dispensed with that.
The greater portion of the morning
session was taken up in^B^aring mo
tions to strike out, the majority of
which were denied. At the rate Attor
ney Ach was proceeding, had all his
motions been granted, little would have
remained in the record. He wished all
the testimony of James Deming strick
en out relative to the private l>ook, and
that of W. "W\ Topping as to the con
tents of the storage book and grain
ledger, particularly the portions relat
ing to the mysterious and phenomenal
increase of grain In the warehouse
designated as "moisture." As a finale
the court was asked to have stricken
from the record the testimony of all
witnesses who testified to business rela
tions with EJppinger & Co. prior ic
April 14, 1903, unless it was shown that
Jacob Eppinger was present at the time
the deals were made.
On motion of Attorney Campbell .e
testimony of James S. Manler relative
to the bankruptcy proceedings in the
United States Court and all evidence
regarding the shipment of lots of wheat
which went out before the warehouse
receipts were hypothecated was strick
en from the record. The three unan
swered questions asked of Topping as
to the deliberate falsincatlon of buoks
and receipts were withdrawn.
WHEAT NOT THERE.
SUDDEX KEJUVEN'ATIOX.
1 -That Jacob Epplnger, during the last
year the firm of Eppinger & Co. was
In business, was In poor health and
knew little or nothing of the affairs
and financial standing of the firm; that
the note for the money borrowed from
the International Banking Company
through Colonel Beck, its manager, was
signed not by the defendant but by Ber
nard Ettlinger; that the business of
the firm was so vast that It would be
ridiculous to suppose its head would
stoop to steal such, a comparatively
trifling sum as the $9800 on which the
Indictment Is based; that if any crime
"/ere committed the criminal certainly
must have been one Bernard Ettlinger,
present address unknownâ these will
constitute the defense in the Eppinger
case, according to the opening state
ment of Attorney Henry Ach. The
day's proceedings were the most inter
acting since the opening of the trial
and the two witnesses put on the stand
by the defense seemed hopelessly lost
when put under cross-examination, one
of them openly admitting that he had
testified to a string of figures without
any knowledge as to their correctness.
He merely read them from a book kept
by another man.

The microscope shows that in the blood
of every person suffering from typhoid the
httle germs can be found as shown above.
They are supposed to get into the water or
milk we dnuk. The germs multiply so
that one germ is capable of producing
about one hundred trillion germs in twen-
ty-four hoars. That is why if they ever
get into the water supply of a town they
multiply so fast that nearly everybody
dnnking the water comes .down with the
disease. There are exceptions, however,
and they are the persons whose health is
perfect, whose blood is pure, and Hrer
active. When the germs ret into a healthy
body they are thrown off with the other
poisons. Recent Chicago statistics show
that one-eighth of all the deaths in the
past two years in that city have resulted
from pneumonia.
The best advice we can rive is to put the
r>ody into a perfectly sound, healthy condi-
â¢jn^ Be assured that yoa have rich, red
blood and an active liver.
Many years a?o Dr. R. V. Pierce, who is
consulting sorireon to the Invalids' Hotel
and Snrpcal Institute at Buffalo, N. Y.,
found certain herbs and roots which, when
made into an alterative extract (without
the nÂ»e of alcohol), seemed to be the very
best means of putting the stomach, blood
and vital organs into proper condition.
This fleeaed to him as close to nature's
way of treating disease as it was possible
to go. J?or over a third of a century Dr.
Pieree's Golden Medical Discovery has had
a wonderful sale and the cures resulting
from its use are numbered by thousands.
It is a tissue-builder, better than cod liver
oil because it does not sicken the etomach,
or offend the taste. It strengthens or.
renews the assimilative. or digestive pro-
cesses in the stomach and puts on healthy
flesh when the weight of the invalid is
reduced below the normal.
Accept no substitute for "Golden Med-
ical Discovery." Nothing else is "just as
food.*

STRIKERS STANDING FIRM.
ST. LOUIS, July 13. â There has not
been an increase in the price of meat
as the result of the strike of the union
butchers and meat cutters in the
packing-houses of St. Louis and East
St. Louis. The packing-houses report
reserve stocks for three to four days'
supply and the majority of the retail
ers have on hand a supply for the
same period. The livestock market is
affected greatly by the strike, as pack
ers are buying sparingly or not at all.
The East St. Louis packing-houses af
fected by the strike were running with
small forces to-day.
In St. Louis the union employes of
the St. Louis Dressed . Beef, and Pro
vision Company, the only St. Louis
packing-house affected by the strike
order, went out to-day. The company
continues at work, but with a small
force, and. In common with all the
other packing-houses affected, is
drawing uuon its reserve "stock to fill
orders.
Situation In the World's Fair City Is
Not Reassuring.
FOUR-DAY MEAT SUPPLY.
The decision ; was given in the suit
brought by the Milwaukee Custom
Tailors' Union, a local concern which
made an agreement with the tailors to
employ none but union workmen.
A temporary injunction was obtain
ed, but this Judge Ledwig ruled was
improvidentially issued. Â¦ â¢
After the injunction was issued the
union instituted proceedings to have
the company punished for contempt
for the alleged failure to comply with
its terms. The motion to punish was
denied and the injunction set aside.
MILWAUKEE, July 13.â Contracts
made by incorporated labor unions
with manufacturers, prohibiting the
employment of non-union workingmen,
are void, according to a decision an
nounced by Judge Ledwig in the Cir
cuit Court to-day. It is the first ruling
had upon the question in Wisconsin
and if sustained by the Supreme Court
will be of far-reaching importance.
An explanation of the generosity of
the banker is given in this story:. While
walking down a principal street in New
York one day Gardner was attracted
by a runaway. A swaying coach con
taining-a child came down the street,
dragged by two frightened horses. The
young man dashed out, seized the ani
mals and brought them to a standstill.
The mother of the child offered Gardner
a reward. He refused it. Then she
gave him her card, telling him if he
ever needed assistance to call upon her.
Gardner refused to give, his name and
disappeared. Wften he came to read
the card he found it bore the name of
the banker's wife.
Soon' afterward Gardner returned to
London. It was there he fell from a
trapeze, missed the net and sustained
serious injuries.
News of the accident appeared in the
New York papers, and with it came the
story of Gardner's act in rescuing ilie
banker's child. Seeing the report, the
banker's wife took the first boat for
London. Upon arrival she engaged two
leading physicians, employed a staff
of competent nurses and did her best
to make Gardner happy In his trouble.
Meanwhile Gardner's father died.
Hearing the news, Gardner asked that
Â¦ his mother might come to him. The
banker's wife at once made arrange
ments, and since that time Mrs. Gard
ner has been with her son.
MILWAUKEE, July 13.â The reason
why a New York banker's family has
been caring for L. M. Gardner of this
city, a young trapeze performer with a
broken Â¦ back who has just arrived at
New York from London, has been rÂ«
vealed. The Gardners, mother and son,
have reached here from the East with
nurses,- and with them came a report
that the banker would build a home for
the boy to insure his comfort as long
as -he lives.

AND ONE OF THE LEADING PACKERS WHOSE GREAT PLANTS ARE
AFFECTED BT THE "WALKOUT OF DISSATISFIED EMPLOYES
A number of women have appealed
to the Kansas City, Kan., flood relief
committee for aid, saying that their
husbands who were packing-house em
ployes were now idle, and the shutting
off of their income. Coming on top of
th^lr losses by the recent flood, has
l?ft them destitute. The strike will
vork a hardship upon these persons,
even if they receive strike benefits.
'â¢We will hire all men who are willing
to work," said Cudahy, "regardless of
whether they are union men or not.
We have from 600 to 800 non-union men
]r-ft in our plant, and expect to hire all
the men we need- We will first use
these men in cleaning up the plant.
After this work is done we expect to
begin killing again.
'I believe that a majority of the men
who went out," continued Cudahy,
'â¢will be back at work within two
weeks. I have never seen men strike
more unwillingly. Many of them told
me that they were striking not because
they wanted to, but because they
wished to obey the strike order.
The Cudahy plant always has been
strictly union.
Although the strike was principally
in the interest of unskilled laborers, a
number of this class of labor at Ar
r.iours did not go out yesterday. These
men do not belong to the union, an
effort to organize them not having suc
ceeded. These unskilled laborers were
put at work to-day in the killing de
partment. At this plant 500 head of
cattle and 1000 hogs had been bought
and an early start on them was made.
The management said that It expected
to increase the force gradually.
J. P. Cudahy of the Cudahy Packing
Company, in a statement, intimated
that his company intended to make
their plant an open one.
KANSAS CITY, Mo., July 13.â At one
of the six local packing plants (Ar
mour's) which were shut down yester
day as a result of the butchers' and
meat cutters' strike, killing was re
eumed to-day on a small scale. The
other plants expect to be running soon
with new men. The big retail dealers
have made arrangements to do their
own killing temporarily and assert that
there will be no increase in prices of
meat, at least at present.
Men Who Caused Strike Are First to
Apply for Work.
DISPLAY OF INGRATITUDE.
WASHINGTON, July 13. â Local
butchers admit that Washington is
again facing a meat famine of serious
proportions as the result of the strike
in the packing -houses in the West.
Prices already have gone up. Prime
beef is held by several of the butch
ers at 35 cents â an increase of from S
to 10 cents over a week ago, and pork
has jumped from 12 to 14 cents a
pound.
ST. PAUL, Minn., July 13.â There ap
pears no immediate danger of a meat
famine in St. Paul and vicinity. It is
said fifty carloads of cattle arrived to
day and they were taken care of by the
half-dozen smaller packing concerns in
South St. Paul and the smaller butch
ers in surrounding cities. The smaller
packers are not affected by the strike.
PHILADELPHIA, July 13.â As a re
sult of the butchers' strike there has
been an advance of from 10 to 12 cents
a pound in the wholesale price of meats
in this city.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, July 13.â
Wholesale prices of all fresh meats
here were advanced about half a cent
per pound to-day. The retailers, how
ever, added, 2 cents a pound to their
selling prices.
SYRACUSE, N. Y., July 13. â Beef
prices in this city were advanced 1
cent a pound to-day. Not more than
three days' supply of dressed meat is
in stock at the local branches.
MILWAUKEE, WIs., July 13. â The
prices of meats in Milwaukee were ad
vanced from 1 to 2 cents per pound
wholesale to-day. None of the Mil
waukee packing plants are affected.
PITTSBURG. July 13.â The strike of
the packing-house employes advanced
the price of meat 3 cents a pound here
to-day.
General Advance in Price of Meat Re
sults From Strike.
ALL BIG CITIES AFFECTED.
NEW YORK, July 13.â When the
hour for opening the big packing
plants in this city had arrived to-day
the strike of the butchers and meat
handlers, instituted in the West yes
terday, was on in this city and before
many hours it was estimated that
nearly 6000 men had quit work. The
men that went out were the butchers,
packers, carriers and cutters, members
of the Greater New York locals of the
Amalgamated Meat Cutters and
Butchers Workmen's Union of Amer
ica.
From the managers of the beef plants
it uvas learned that the beef supply is
very low, some of the dealers having
only enough to last fifteen minutes
when the daily purchasers arrived.
Within a few hours the price of beef
had gone up two and three cents a
pound, with indications of advancing
further. None of the dealers had a
sufficient supply to last longer than a
week and it is the opinion among them
that If the strike continue a meat fam
ine is inevitable.
There is a possibility of a sympa
thetic strike of the Benchmen's Asso
ciation. These men represent the cut
ters in retail stores and such a step
would completely tie up the retail
trade and directly affect families.
The seriousness of the situation was
shown in /a statement issued by the
manager for Swift & Co. He said:
"We have not advanced the price of
anything, for the simple reason that
we haven't anything to advance the
price on. I am willing .to pay 14 cents
a pound for a carload of beef if I can
get it, but I cannot get It." ' . :
New York Butchers
Go Out on Sympa
thetic Strike.
* # Our organization is taking a stand
against a reduction in wages for labor
In the Dlants owned and controlled by
the following, which are those affected:
Armour & Co.. Swift & Co., Nelson,
Morris & Co.. National Packing Com
pany, Schwarzchild & Sulzberger and
Cudahy &. Co. All our organization
asks is that 18% cents an hour be the
minimum. In view of the fact that in
nearly all of the departments the' av
erage working time is forty hours a
week, it can be readily seen that our
demands are not unreasonable. All of
the independent companies are paying
a much higher rate than we are asking
the trust companies to pay. Our or
ganization has never interfered with a
reduction of working forces, except
where our members were discriminat
ed against."

the strike is for Increased wages. Pres

of non-union men and business would
be resumed at once. In fact, two of
the larse plants began hiring outside
help to-day.
â¢ Office men were taken to the slaugh
tering departments to-day, where they
donned overalls and aprons and assist
ed in the work of caring for the meat
left on hand, and, in some cases, in
killing cattle.
The South Omaha Fire and Police
Board has given orders that saloons
shall sell no beer except by the glass
over the bar during the continuance of
the strike. A number of special police
were added to the force, although this
precaution has thus far been unnec
essary.
The closing of the packing-houses
has had the effect of throwing a great
number of men out of work who were
not directly employed at the packing
plants. They include railroad men,
stock yards employes and others whose
employers depended on the packing

business interests.

Springer said he had a - square
chance to see the short man and would
have no difficulty In identifying him.
Wleklng declared that the taller one's
red mask slipped and exposed his face
so much that he could be recognized.
The robbers wore dark sack suits and
sleuch hats.
"Throw up your hands," sounded by
a pair of husky voices in Unison, was
the cry that startled the people In the
saloon as the double doors at the side
entrance on Eighth street swung open
and two men, their faces masked with
red handkerchiefs, stepped inside the
entrance, pointing pistols at the sur
prised men within. At a card table di
rectly in front of the entrance sat
William CWieklng, a brother of the pro
prietor, reading a newspaper. Oppo
site him was another man, a stranger,
who jumped as quickly as Wieking did
when he heard the command. Up went
their hands. Behind the bar was Al
Springer, the bartended who was talk
ing to Fred Jo: elyn, - customer who
was leaning on the counter. Their
arms also flew heavenward. A fifth man
had just stepped 4nto the front door,
but he dodged out when he saw what
was going on.
With all hands up, the taller of the
two robbers stood guard near the side
door, while his companion, shorter
than the other, rushed over to the
cash register, his pistol j covering
Springer and Josselyn. The tall man's
weapon took care of Wieking. The
strange man slipped out by the side
door. It is suspected he might have
been a confederate. The short robber
nervously fumbled the register key In
his hurry to open the till. . As soon as
the drawer responded he grabbed
handfuls of coin and shovqd the money
into his coat pocket. In his eagerness
he let a few dollars in dimes and
nickels drop on the floor. Then he
backed away and the two robbers left
the place by the same way they had
entered.
Two masked robbers, armed with
pistols, held up four men at 11:20
o'clock to-night in Henry Wieking's
saloon at the southwest corner of
Eighth and Washington streets, s'tole
$100 from the cash register and escaped.
The robbery "was doubly daring, as the
saloon Is- in the very heart of the city,
at a transfer point for street-car pas
sengers. Electric lights glare and make
the corner almost as bright as day.
Trolley cars pass on both streets every
few minutes and the Seventh-street
railroad trains run only a block distant.
. The bold pair took the saloon by
storm, and before the surprised occu
pants had awakened to what was doing
the robbers had accomplished their
purpose. The men were seen as they
departed, sauntering quietly along
Eighth street west, toward Clay street.
As quickly as possible the police were
notified. Captain of Police Wilson sent
out posses of men with excellent de
scriptions of the robbers.

As to Wagner's mustc. It ' hardly deserves
the sweeping condemnation of those who de
cry it absolutely: neither Is It equal to his
most inspired scores. Instead of being "se
nile," may It not be true that In attempting
to depict even a mediaeval concept of religion
In which there Is much that is extraneous, he
wan not so thoroughly at home as In other
subjects, or may it not be another proof that
dramatic expression Is not the fitting garb In
which to clothe religious Ideas?
"Parnifal" ia not a great epic poerf from
any point of view. The stress laid upon cer
tain details that are repulsive to modern no
tion* of ' womanly purity and manly honor
would be unwarranted were It not for the fact
that they are merely Incidental to the great
lesson of the poem, that the negative virtue
of the "guileless fool" can never furniwh an
antidote for sin. and that only by resisting
temptation can â¢ virtue become positive and
thereby conquer. Contrast this with the in
sistence of Ibsen in many of hlÂ» plays, who
dwells on morbid concepts of love, generally
unrelieved by the atoning Â¦virtue of repentance
and made more repulsive by the acceptance
of suicide as the recourse of those who have
sinned. In "Parsifal" are fixed certain con
cepts of the ateat lessons of repentance, self
control and purity. It rest* with us to em
phasize the points that are helpful tn our own
endeavor to attain the higher Ideals of life.
Such Ideals forbid our dwelling on Ignoble epi
sode*, excepting In their relation to the nobler
aspects of the life we Keek to attain, for In
the last analysis our ideals are of our own
making.
"Parsifal" Is full of Wagner's most pro
nounced mystical, pseudo-philosophical, quael
religlous ldeaa, but where Is there any setting
of this motif that is not surcharged with these
elements, with greater or less weight laid upon
this or that aspect according to Indlvdual bias?
Wagner was in many respects. a nineteenth
century pagan, and no one has succeeded in sat
isfactorily demonstrating that through "Parsi
fal"'he became Christian, although the attempt
has been made: but, on the other hand, it Is
equally impossible to feel that In his art he
was consciously Immoral.
Up to Christmas eve. 1903, â¢Â¦Parsifal" bad
remained sacred to Bayreuthv. but its . produc
tion In New York .on that date has precip
itated discussion that makes It necessary for
u'> to consider the question opened by that
performance." One may acknowledge that
"Parsifal" is not "Wagner'* greatest work
without thereby implying or baldly stating
that it is senile. It is possible for one to
admit that "Parsifal," minus Bayreutb. is
not as effective as "Parsifal" plus Bayreuth.
One may grant that the audiencos who have
listened to its performance in Ne*- York have
displayed neither Irreverence nor lack of ap
preciation and may further acknowledge the
artistic strength of the performances.
If "Parsifal" In its proper environment has
been a stimulus to those who have journeyed
thither Jor inspiration, not because It was a
"fad," what great good hag been accom
plished by destroying the illusion, and the dis
regard of the composer's dying wish be looked
upon us an act of reverence toward the creator
o! the. work?. With many worthy operas still
unperformed, or carelessly given, might not
some of this great effort' have been diverted
from the -production of the works of those
modern writers who seem to glory In the
"seamy side" of life, to the- adequate re
habilitation of. . neglected operas, instead of
bringing a work that was designed for a
peculiar environment into such surroundings
as must surely tend to accentuate its weak
nesses and destroy Its effect?
"Parsifal" was Intended for the. peculiar en
vironment of Bayreuth and no other, and
placing- reliance upon that environment was
In consonance with One of the fundamental
concepts of Wagner'a theory. By environment
I refer neither to the restaurants nor to the
often vulgar display made by the Wagner
family and satellites, but the state of mind
felt by one who considers all that Bayreuth
has 'stood for, who Is Influenced by the as
sociations of Wagner's grave and the resting
place of the prophetic Jean Paul, or who. tn
other words. Is old-fashioned enough to have
ideals and give himself over to them. If wo
then get the real effect of "Parsifal" why
should *Â« rob the work of all these contribut
ing causes and then wax eloquent because It
Is no longer effective? Personally, considering
"Parsifal" purely as music. I would not dream
for a moment of ranking it among his greatest
works, but It Is one of the most Important
when heard under the right conditions, even If
in loving It we are obliged to forgive much.-
Professor Albert A. Stanley, profes
sor of music at the University of Mich
igan, does not agree with those critics
who say Richard Wagner's "Parsifal"
is the least to be admired of all the
STeat composer's works. Itls not the
greatest of his compositions, to be
sure, but it does not deserve the slings
and arrows hurled at It by thelbritics.
It does not deserve to becalled "senile"
and it really carries a great lesson to
humanity.
, Professor Stanley's views- were ex
pressed In a lecture with "Parsifal"
for the subject before a gathering of
summer school students this evening
at the University of California. In the
beginning Professor Stanley devoted
.Â«ome time to a review of the contro
versy that ensued over the appearance
of the opera in New York, which, he
said, was necessary to a discussion of
the subject in a sane and impartial
manner. To Herr Conried, who first
presented the opera In this country, he
attributes honest motives, saying that
he knew there must be many- who did
not question the advisability and eth
ical right of producing "Parsifal" in
America in the face of the opposition
of the Wagner heirs. Professor Stan
ley said:

Jury, In the case of Horace A. Hor
ton. who was accidentally electro
cuted last Thursday evening at hi3
home at 1220 Thirteenth avenue, while

plunged to his "death from a second

street early this morning. Just how the
acident occurred Is a matter of con
jecture, some believing that the unfor
tunate man was -a somnambulist and
others that he lost his balance while
trying to close the window.
Boyd was found on the pavement in
a semi-conscious condition and Dr. W.
W. Kergan was called to attend him.
Boytf's right arm was broken and three
of his ribs fractured and he sustained
internal Injuries. Everything possible
was done to relieve the injured man
and at dawn the ambulance was called
to remove him to the Providence Hos
pital. He died In the conveyance and
his body was removed to the Morgue.
The sill of the window from which
Boyd fell is but one foot from the floor
and the possibility of an accident is
apparent. Boyd leaves a wife, from
whom he was separated, and two chil

Policeman Ely's attention was called
to Howard by Rose Burton, 11 years
old, residing at 4608 Maple street. She
told the patrolman that a roan had
been pursuing her and some girl com
panions. They had seen him on Forty
eighth street, near Telegraph avenue.
Ely found Howard sitting on the
Â¦edge of the sidewalk, apparently under
the influence *of liquor. The policeman
got the man on his feet and walked
with him to the lockup on Telegraph
avenue, a block from where he picked
up Howard. The policeman put his
prisoner in the cell and telephoned to
the City Hall for the patrol wagon. At
that time, 8:45 o'clock, Howard seemed
overcome with liquor. Policeman Wal
ters reported that as he entered the
lockup Howard gave a gasp and top
pled over dead. Detectives Kyte and
Quigley investigated and reported that
death was probably caused by alco
holism.
Howard had been arrested a number
of times. On June 22 and on July 2 he
was in jail for drunkenness. . He was
35 years old, a native of this State, un
married and without a permanent res
idence. The coroner took charge of the
body.
Thomas Howard, arrested to-night,
by Policeman Ely for drunkenness,
was found dead In a cell at the Alden
lockup by Patrol Wagon Officer Wal
ters, who responded to a call to remove
the prisoner to the City Jail. Only
half an hour had elapsed from the time
Ely took the man to the lockup and
when Walters arrived to find him a

WILL DISCUSS FAIR
F. W. Denning, who has 'acted as so
licitor and collector for the Singer Man
ufacturing Company, 510 Thirteenth
Ftreet, for the last three years In this
city, was to-day charged with the em
bezzlement of $2000 by A. W. Nolte,
the Pacific Coast agent of the concern,
and the Police Department has taken
the ca-Â«e in charge.
Denning was very well known here
and was popular among his acquaint
ances, lie worked over the entire
county and solicited a great deal of
trade for his employers. He also col
lected much money. A portion of this
he turned in and, according to the com
plaint filed against him, a large amount
he placed in his own pocket.
Denuing disappeared in the latter
part of May. Where he went no one
seemed to know until his housekeeper,
Mrs. F. Thompson, of S16 San Pablo
avenue, received a letter from him writ
ten from an obscure town in Kansas
announcing his intention of going to
Mexico to avoid prosedution. In this
letter he confessed guilt but said that
he had offered to make good his pecu
lations by weekly payments. This
offer, he says, was refused and he re
sorted to flight. I While the complaint
charges Denning with the theft of.-$2000.
Mrs. Thompson avers that the amount
stolen by the former collector does not
amount to more than $400.
This afternoon Nolte, who has been
in this city for three weeks investigat
ing the matter of Denning's alleged
shortage, appeared before Justice of
the Peace Geary and swore to the em
bezzlement complaint. Nolte stated
that he -did not know where, ac
cused was at the present time, but the
police have reason to believe that he
is sojourning in an adjoining county
and two officers will make a search
for him to-morrow.

SAYS COMPANY
IS BLAMABLE
On the prisoner's person were found
Milroad passes issued to Wiley J. Phil-
Bps. copies of the Voice and credentials
issued to Phillips as a delegate to the
National Prohibition convention. At
the City Jail the man vociferously in
sisted that he was Wiley J. Phillips
and he furthermore signed a receipt in
s firm hand for the return of his doc
uments when he was released from jail
in the morning.
The real Phillips was innocently
traveling eastward, according to Pas
tor Ford, when the evil scheme was
operating against him in Oakland.
The police dispute this. Policeman
Jame3 Mulgrew, who arrested the man
that gave his name as Wiley J.' Phillips,
is positive that his intoxicated prisoner
was none other than the Los Angeles
editor. Mulgrew 6aid:
'"The day after I arrested this man
people from the Prohibition headquart
ers in this city came to me and showed
me a photograph which they said was
that of Wiley J. Phillips, editor of the
California Voice. It was a photograph
of the man I arrested. There isn't any
doubt about it at all, and I do not
pee why they are keeping things stirred
up. The old* man was drunk, and he
had a bottle >of sherry In his pocket,
from which he invited me to take a
drink."
Now comes the Rev. Frank S. Ford,
pastor of the Eastside Congregational
Church of Los Angeles, with a defense
of Phillips. The preacher declares that
the editor of the Voice has been a total
abstainer from intoxicating beverages
for many years; that the clergyman
editor had been waging a warfare in
Los Angeles for morality that had
made him a target of abuse and at
tack from the vicious element; that he
Â¦was threatened with all manner of per
sonal violence unless he should cease
his crusade. Phillips, says his clerical
defender, did not waver in the good
fight, and was therefore the victim of
a despicable plot to ruin his fair name
and good repute.
According to the Southern Califor
nian. Phillips was impersonated by a
man who had followed the editor to
Oakland while he was en route to the
National Prohibition . convention at
Indianapolis, and that the false editor
Phillips thus caused contumely to be
heaped upon the real worker in the
<.ause.
Contention has arisen between the
police of Oakland and friends of the
Rev. Wiley J. Phillips, editor of the
California Voice, State organ of the
rrohibitionists, and for many years a
leading clergyman of the Methodist
Episcopal church. The battle wages
because the police records of this city
show that "Wiley J. Phillips, 67 years
old. newspaper man, weight 140 pounds,
native of Virginia, resident of Los An
geles, was arrested June 23 for drunk
enness." The Â«anÂ£ record shows that
Wiley J. Phillips forfeited J6 bail when
the case was called the following day
in the Police Court.

for the extension of the seawalL Sec
retary Scott of the Chamber of Com
merce stated yesterday that a course
of public instruction in the matter
would be commenced at an early date.
The prirposed improvement is badly
r.eeded, as the wharves are always
crowded with freight and business is
transacted only with the greatest diffi
culty. Â¦
These organizations had responded
in a manner that plainly suggested the
willingness of employers to give their
employes the time required and no par
ticular objection would . be made to
their leaving their labors Friday even-
Ing instead of Saturday. In conse
quence it was*>declded that the State
troops should be moved by the railroad
company Friday evening and be land
ed at the camp Saturday morning.
About 2500 men of the National Guard
will go to the camp. The railroad com
pany estimates that seven trains will
be necessary to handle the men and
that sixty coaches, seven baggage cars
and a horse train will be necessary to
effect the prompt arrival of the troops
at Camp Atascadero.
General Dickinson and Adjutant
General Lauck are using their best ef
forts toward impressing upon the em
ployers of the State the Importance of
the coming maneuvers so far as the
National Guard is concerned and have
received many communications ex
pressing sympathy in the movement,
which is the first to be undertaken in
conjunction with the regular troops
under the provisions of the new army
regulations.
WILL LEAVE FRIDAY.
Yesterday's conference was the re
sult of a meeting betwen the adjutant
general of the State and the railroad
officials on the previous day, when
General Lauck was confronted with
the obstacles that had suddenly arisen.
At yesterday's conference there were
present Colonel Josslyn, chief at ptaff;
Colonel Patton, department quarter
master of the Department of Califor
nia, representing General MacArthur
during his absence; Major General
Dickinson, Adjutant General Lauck
and Colonel Wilhelm, inspector gen
eral of the National Guard, and Mas
ter of Transportation Richardson and
Assistant General Passenger Agent
Judah of the Southern Pacific Com
pany. After discussing the general
situation, in so far as it concerns the
State troops, it was the consensus of
opinion of the officers that while the
convenience of the guardsmen' should
be considered in many ways, their ob
jections to leaving for the camp on
Friday night were not well founded.
It developed at the meeting that Gen
eral Dickinson, commanding the guard,
had communicated with the Merchants*
Association and other commercial
bodies of the State relative to granting
their employes reasonable time In
which to go to camp and receive need
ed instruction in military maneuvers.
MILITARY MEN CONFER*
A conference of representatives of
the regular army, the National Guard
and the Southern Pacific Company was
held at army headquarters yesterday
afternoon for the purpose of arranging
for the transportation of the State
military forces to the coming scene of
maneuvers at Camp Atascadero. As al
ready announced, the National Guards
men have been greatly annoyed by the
fact that trfe Southern Pacific Com
pany had informed the adjutant gen
eral of the State that it would be un
able to move the citizen soldiery on
Saturday, August 6, by reason of the
fact that on the following day it has
contracted to handle a large number
at summer excursionists and has not
the necessary equipment to meet the
requirements of the National Guards
men on the preceding day. It has been
maintained by the guardsmen that
many of their employers would not
grant them the much sought for per
mission to leave their labors a day
earlier in order to comply with the
orders issued by Major General Mac-
Arthur of the regular army .or the
encampment and this fact has caused
no small amount of uneasiness on the
part of Adjutant General Lauck.

Mr. and Mrs. D'Ombrin celebrated
the arrival 6ome weeks ago of a little
son by giving a dinner party at their
residence, 1036 Bush street, last Fri
day night. The dining room was deck
ed with roses and Japanese lanterns.
Several hours were spent at the festive
board. The guests were: Mrs. W. P.
Wand, Mrs. E. D. Robinson, Miss M.
Robinson, Mrs. M. Thomas, the Misses
Simmons, Dr. J. C. Stinson, Dr. Peters,
Professor Spamer, E. M. Lewis, H.

On Monday the Steele-Shorb wedding
will take place. The ceremony will be
quietly celebrated, only relatives being
bidden. Miss Shorb and her mother,
Mrs. Ynez Shorb White, possess a
wide acquaintanceship over the State,
particularly In the south.
The Rawlings-Warner wedding is set
for July 20. The ceremony will be cele
brated at the town house of the Warn
ers, who are returning from their Mill
Valley retreat for the event.
The wedding of pretty Marie Adam
and young Mr. Musto will occur in
September. It is said that a large
church wedding is planned. Miss Adam
will make a stunning bride.
The wedding of Miss Stella McCalla
and William Wallace Chapin, set for
August 3, has been postponed, prob
ably until the early fall, owing to the
recent Illness of the groom. Mr. Chapin
is a guest at the McCalla home.
The wedding of Miss Elizabeth Cam
eron Hooper and John Osgood Blanch
ard will take place on Saturday after
noon, July SO, at St. Mark's Church.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The ceremony was read by the Rev.
Mr. Worcester. Captain Truly served
the groom as best man, both of whom
were in full dress uniform and looking
very brave.
The army was well represented
among the guests, some very smart
looking women among them, and so,
too, was there a plenitude of gallant
officers in full panoply of gold lace.
The young people left after brief con
gratulations for the nuptial trip. On
their return they will reside on Angel
Island, where the gallant Thirteenth is
stationed.
Within, embers crackled on the
hearth, candles glowed from the
sconces on the walls, and forest treas
ures, pine boughs, cones and mountain
daisies made the air redolent 'of sum
mer.
Flags were draped in the corners of
the char>el above the reading desk, and
â rather singularly â were the stars and
Etripes draped upon the prie dieu, upon
which the bride and groom knelt to
avow their loves.
The bride, a tall, slender maiden of
dainty coloring, was gowned in Nile
green, wearing a picturesque hat with
white plumes, exactly suiting her style.
She was attended by Miss Florence
Hay of Fruitvale as honor maid, who
wore a fetching frock of pale blue with
a white picture hat. Then" came the
stunning bevy of ribbon-bearers, all
gowned In white and wearing white
hats, though each differently designed.
It was they who held the ribbon bands,
red, white and blue, that formed the
bridal aisle. Maidenhair ferns were
borne by this pretty guard of honor,
composed of Mrs. William Hawley,
Mrs. J. Gibson Taylor, Mrs. George
Williamson, Mrs. C. O. Edwards, Mrs.
Lottie Patton, Miss Frances Grow,
Miss Mabel Reed and Miss Hallie Kim
ball.
The wedding: yesterday ot Miss Mary
Bright "Wallace and Lieutenant Gilbert
McElroy, of the Thirteenth Infantry,
U. S. A., was one of the prettiest
nuptial affairs of midsummer. Its set
ting: was exquisite, for not in the whole
city is there so quaint and beautiful a
little chapel as that of the Swedenbor
glans, with its arbor of vines leading
through the garden into the little
sanctuary.

three months ago I was attacked with that .
terrible disease, locomotor ataxia. Power to !
balance, stand, or even sit down, entirely lost.
Two best doctors of San Francisco and Hot
Spring!.. Ark., failed to help me. My stom-
ach, bowels and kidneys failed to work. I had
catarrh of stomach head and bladder as a re-
sult of the disease; these troubles became
chronic. At times my heart would beat like a
arum, my eyes grew weak, my memory bad,
mv nerves wrecked. Three months ago I went
to .Tuscan Springs. What happened since was I
a pleasant surprise to me. Drank the waters,
took the baths â after three weeks' treatment Â¦
stomach, bowels, bladder and kidneys In per-
fect condition, eyesight perfect, nervousness
gone, memory good. After three months' treat-
ment, walked without a cane, with eyes closed
and up and down steep hills; am cured of this
dread disease, now walk with slight limp.

V A saloon-keeper was brought before the bar of an
Oakland Judge the other day on a charge of selling
liquor to girls in his groggery. In Oakland this is a
serious offense, and the defendant forfeited $1250 and
his license in penalty. What a curious and sensational
situation would develop in San Francisco if we could
find a Judge with the same opinions and the courage to
enforce them as this Oakland protector of ' youth and
morals.
IT is gratifying to intellectual Californians, who are
proud of the pre-eminence of their State and of its
citizens who are gifted in such ways as to attract at
tention wider and longer than the commonwealth itself,
that the oratorical fame of Mr. Delmas does not have
to rest upon his speech at Si. Louis nominating Hearst.
He put his goods on a falling market, and though flat
tery, sugared and scented, plays through the speech like
lightning through a summer cloud, it is known that it
was insufficient to sate Hearst's appetite. >
He indulged in a variety of comparisons to bring out
in higher relief the ascriptions to his candidate,' and
among them compared him to the pole star. That is
not original. The pole star has been an oratorical
property ever since it was used to fix the points of the
compass. With the task he had in hand Mr, -Delmas
should not have borrowed a figure from Bossuet, Burke,
Shakespeare and a large lot of geniuses and gentlemen
who while alive used, the pole star as a horse to draw the

The First Burmese Novel.
A new departure In Burmese litera
ture, in the form cf a publication of a
Burmese novel, has been welcomed In
Burma, says a correspondent. To^every
one familiar with the literature of the
Burmese â and, unhappily, they are
not many â there is no doubt that this
departure will be welcomed as a re
lief from the tedious tales printed In
ponderous volumes and written in con
ventional style.
An educated Burman well known in
Rangoon has had the happy Idea of
writing the novel somewhat on the lines
of those Issued daily by the publishers
in other countries. The task was one be
set with many difficulties, the first
and greatest of these being the lan
guage itself, for its flexibility In ex
pressing new Ideas makes it, we are
told, a' very unwieldy instrument in
the hands of even the most accomplish
ed scholar. The cause or this stiffness
is to be found in the evolution of Bur
mese literature. The first Burmese
novel which introduces this new de
parture from conventional literature,
and surprised and even astonished
Burmese readers, has appeared in ser
ial form In the Friend of Burma and
will be shortly published in book form
with Illustrations. The story Is enti
tled "Maung Gin Manng Ma Maydo
Vatthu." It is interesting, we are
assured, not only as to its pilot, but as
giving much valuable insight into Bur
mese family life and into the customs
and practices of the Burmese people.
Burmese life is painted, not *as seen
through European glasses, but from
within by one who had . lived and Is
living itâ Lahore (India) Tribune.
Annaklahaash, chief of the juneau Indians, in token
of peace and friendliness has- sent a splendid totem to
President Roosevelt. While the President undoubtedly
admires the gift and appreciates the spirit of the simple
giver, it is likely that even the Presidential contempt for
difficulties will be awed at an attempt to pronounce that
name.
BONFIRES â C. A. B.. San Leandro.
Cal. The Igniting of bonfires on mid
summer eve, June 23. the eve of St.
John's day, was part of one of the most
Joyous festivals of Christendom during
the Middle Ages. From the account
of Jakob Grimm in Deutsche Mytholo
gie the festival seems to have been ob
served -with similar rites In all coun
tries of Europe. Fires were kindled in
the streets and market places chiefly,
were blessed by the parish priest and
prayer and praise offered until they
burned out, but usually they were sec
ular in character and conducted by the
laity. The young people leaped over
the flames or threw flowers and gar
lands into them. Jumping through tha
flames was not a display of agility, but
in obedience of an ancient custom,
which, It Is asserted, prevailed- before
the birth of St. John. At one time it
was the belief that the souls of all peo
ple'who slept on St. John's eve would
leave the body and wander to the place
where death would finally occur, and it
was to prevent the soul from wander
ing that people sat at the church door
or took part in the festivities on St.
John's eve.

courtyard with his two hands resting
on the head of a hooky cane and all
supporting his head, the forehead of

convey him to what will be his last
resting place this side of the potters*
field. The man for the present is John

to mention it would only inflict addi

other choice timbersâ would be re

by the offending persons. John C
lived not very far from Hyde and
California streets, where strangers
visiting our city were invariably In

early '70's that John C was one of

The cost of the coronation of King
Edward VII, details of which were re
cently published, establishes a record
for modern times..' It was considered,
until recently, a lordly and magnifi
cent thing for the subjects of George
IV to spend Â£238,238 In putting a crown
on his head, but we have eclipsed their
lavishness by Â£121,000. William IV and
Queen Adelaide were content with a
modest Â£50,000. It/ is not easy, says
the London Chronicle, to understand in
what King Edward's Â£259,000 was sunk,
not bo easy, at least, as in the case of
George IV â a sumptuous record of
whose coronation proved too costly to
finish. The part which did appear con
tained seventy- three colored drawings,
"finished like enamels, on velvet ami

guineas. A different spirit animated

the past thirty years. He crossed

the pillars of German agrarianism, that
powerful political sect which refuses to
recognize that modern Germany has

Births, marriages and deaths are
very common at sea; cases of suicide,
although not materially swelling the
records of deaths, are by no means in
frequent. It often happens that mental
depression is accentuated by the vast
ness and solitude of the ocean. The
sense of loneliness, helplessness and in
significance has been known to develop
into suicidal tendencies. Strangely
enough, during an actual tempest the
sense of self-preservation seems to
overpower the desire for self-destruc
tion. Some months ago a young lady
on board a steamer bound for a Cana
dian port evinced much apprehension
as to her safety during a violent storm.
Less than two days later, when the sea
was calm and sailing conditions pleas
ant, she climbed over the bulwarks
and threw herself into the ocean.
The .fascination of watching the
swift flow of water from tb.3 propellers
at the stern of a vessel is a well-known
cause of suicide. Even sailors who
have gazed down at the surging stream
have been overcome with the morbid
Impulse to leap into it. In the Red
Sea and Indian Ocean. Lascars, mad
with heat, have leaped out of the en
gine-room and at a bound have dived
overboard, never to be teen again.

seek oblivion in suicide. Two cases oc

proposition to unite the great population on the east side
of the bay in one government, but the plan is before the
public and there is no room for doubt that it will be in
issue until a definite settlement is made.
Such a settlement can only be secured by going ahead
to a finality. The Alamedans fear a change in the stat
utes of the State which will compel them to submit to
be "gobbled," as they call the proposed process. They
are of the opinion that they can make a new charter, to
be ratified by the Legislature, making permanent, their
individual government. Thereafter a consolidation -t
would find a charter in the way which could be amended
by consolidation, but the> people would vote on the
amendment. But after such new charter is adopted
the argument for consolidation and its economies will
be strengthened. A new charter will increase the cost
of the individual government, as it has in Oakland and
as it will in Berkeley if that city adopt the same expedi
ent. If the thin populations were consolidated they
would make the second municipality in the State. We
do not say that there is anything in mere size, but it is
claimed that a common government for them all will be
a better government and more economical.
It is easily foreseen that the discussion of the issues
is destined to cause much heat and friction between the
people of the east side. There is bad blood over it now,
and it will get no better until some sort of settlement is
reached. It will enter into district arid State and county
politics, and will cause a constant turmoil and confusion.
It seems that a little wisdom and good feeling will save
all of this and bring the issue to a test that will be ac
cepted as final.
Instead of the people of Berkeley and Alameda rush
ing into a new charter campaign, why not get together
with Oakland and agree to constitute a representative
commission from each town, empowered to get together
and see what kind of a general charter can be framed
for a common government of them all, each retaining
its present name and place on the political map of the
State, after the borough plan which put New York and
Brooklyn under one government, leaving them still
known as New York and Brooklyn?
It is better to defer a fight over the matter until a
compromise like that has been tried. Such a common
charter would have to go to the Legislature. It is pos
sible, too. that it would require an amendment to the
State constitution, so that the finality in either event
would not be imminent, and the people would have time
for ample consideration of the whole matter in coolness
and not in heat of temper. The underlying facts of
taxation and expense could all be developed and com
pared with what can be fairly predicted of the new gov
ernment, and as a result many men might change their
minds. Perhaps those who now favor consolidation
would get light leading them to abandon it. On the
other hand those now in opposition might be led by facts
and comparisons to go to the other side.
The legal phase of the subject is very interesting in
deed. The whole State is interested in the questions it
will raise. There are other towns that will want to
economize or satisfy their ambitions _by consolidating.
At present it is an untried field, as proposed on the east
side. The city and county consolidation of. San Fran
cisco was a different matter entirely. It dealt with a
duality' of government over the same population. The
merger was easy. No heartburnings about going off
the map were caused by it. No pride of municipal in
dividuality had to be wounded. The only issue was the
substitution by the same population of one government
It is already obvious that the east side cannot be sim
ilarly consolidated. Individuality must be respected. and
how can this be done except by borrowing from the ex
perience of New York and adopting the borough system?

Chasing "Business" Principles.
No political utterance by any party in this country
was ever as seamed and scarred, embossed and em
broidered with contemptible cowardice and purulent
dishonesty as that.
The Republicans and Democrats who stood for the
gold standard in 1896 made it possible and finally secured
it by legislation enacted independently of any increase in
the supply of gold. That increase had nothing to do
with the adoption of the standard and has no influence
whatever upon its maintenance. The plank boasted that
seven hundred millions of the increased supply have
come to the United States. That is true. It is also
true that if Brj'an, John Sharp, Williams, Champ Clark,
Judge Parker and the big and little deities of the party
could have ha'd their way and adopted free silver, not a
single dollar of the increased supply of gold would have
come to us, nor would there be left with us a single dol
lar of the stock that was on hand when these men were
oozing enthusiasm at Chicago over Bryan's cross-of-gold
speech, or supporting his pretenses. It is a poor com
pliment to the common sense of men like Ben Cable,
Charles S. Hamlin, Thomas Taggart and Robert Patti
son, gold Democrats -and delegates at St. Louis, that
they should agree to submit to such an untrue state
ment of a scientific situation.
The platform is intolerably verbose and repetitious,
and presents only three issues â tariff, taxation and the
Philippines. As for the tariff, there is no half way
tinker's shop nor cobbler's stall between protection and
free trade. Each represents an economic principle that
may be defended. There can be no hybrid between
them. If protection enrich manufacturers, free trade
enriches the importers. If promoting the private busi
ness, the employing and consuming capacity of men, is
bad, then we must stop doing anything, and protection
and free trade arc open to the same impeachment. The
Democratic platform proposes a mule tariff, something
that is neither horse nor ass, but has long ears and can
bray. If it had boldly declared for free trade the party
would have been entitled to respect. But its tariff ex
pression is worthy to sit in the stocks with the gold
standard hypocrisy to be egged by the people.
The people are informed that they are taxed within
an inch of their lives to 'support the Federal Govern
ment. As the indisputable official figures show that
Federal taxation, interest on the public debt and all
amounts to just two cents per day per capita, the bur
den will be a light one to lift, and won't be missed -when
The Philippine issue will be discussed separately.
The significant feature of the convention was its domi
nation by Southern men. Jones of Arkansas, chairman
of the National Committee, called it to order and intro
duced Williams of Mississippi as temporary chairman,
and he was succeeded by Champ Clark of Missouri as
permanent chairman, and Daniel of Virginia was chair
man of the platform committee. Every one of these was
a free silver man and cursed Cleveland in 1896. Their
lack of principle is the smallpox which infects the party
they control. v';f"
THE speeches at the Democratic National Conven
tion, which were addressed to any subject out
side the internal feuds of the party, were elabo
rate denials of any relation between Republican policy
and the progress and prosperity of the country. If that
be true, then no public political policy or method of ad
ministration can affect in any way the economic condi
tion and material progress of the people. This is the
logic of the Democratic statement, and it makes idle the
promises of the platform, which run to the subjects of
taxation and prices, and promise "the rescue of fche ad
ministration of the Government from the headstrong,
arbitrary and spasmodic methods which* distract busi
ness by uncertainty and pervade the public mind with
dread, distrust and perturbation."
This platform expression is lifted bodily out of the
trust organs. They used it in every impressive form
when President Roosevelt ordered the seven cases
brought against the trusts, and were frantically dupli
cated when each of the suits was won. No legitimate
business interest of the country has felt any dread of
Republican policy or administration, nor any uncer
tainty. What those business interests require is the
gold standard of value, assuring financial stability and
adherence to our economic and revenue policy of pro
tection.
The gold standard plank of the platform, as first
agreed upon and then struck out to please and placate
Bryan, was a lying evasion, which every gold standard
Democrat knows to be false. A party that proposed to
'be false about a policy of such importance, 'and
finally made a cowardly surrender, is not fit to be trusted
with its maintenance, no matter what may be the pres
ent position of its candidate, who twice voted to destroy
the gold standard. The plank, as framed and then killed,
said: "The discoveries of gold within the past few
years and the great increase in the production thereof
adding two thousand million dollars to the world's sup
ply, of which seven hundred millions fall to the share of
the United States, have contributed to the maintenance of
a money standard of value no longer open to question,
removing that issue from the field of political conten-
atfon, but, looking around us and
above us, there is hardly a cloud visi
ble on the sky. The sun of Canada's
prosperity shines clear and high. â Ot

The foreman of the Nevada stable,
formerly In the livery business at
Stockton, P. L. Bury, heard Monroe
declare the stable to be unfair and the
employer of "cheap labor and Chinese
labor." He said that the banners of
the pickets frightened horses entering
and leaving the barn. One rig, he said,
was forced to go to the back door to
obtain entrance.

Joining 315 Howard street on July 11
and stealing a quantity of copper and
piping belonging to Carl L. Schalitz,
proprietor of copper works at 309
Howard street. The stolen property
was recovered.
C. Farris, a builder and contractor,
told the court that he had seen twenty
to thirty men walking around in front
cf the stable and saw Monroe directing
them. They talked in a loud TÂ«9ice, but
only cried out "Unfair stable." Teams,
he said, were obliged to drive around
the strikers In order to enter the sta
ble. Farris said that he we greeted
Jokingly by his union acquaintances,
vho asked him if he was a "scab."
D. M. McCarthy, who is in the horse
business and a member of the Carriage
and Stable Owners' Association, saw
the parade of pickets with banners and
observed Monroe " in the crowd. He
heard the cry of "scab," but could not
say where it came from. The crowd
that gathered outside the stable, he
eaid, interfered with the progress of
pedestrians. He testified that when he
drove horses through the crowd he had
to do so by main force.
C. P. Howes, a real estate broker,
corroborated the preceding witnesses
and Eaid he had heard remarks stating
that the stable belonged to the "trust"
nr.d was "down on laboring men." He
had heard the strikers say that the
Charles Maginr.is, in charge of the
Ftcck and wagons for Blake, Moffitt &
Townc, testified that representatives
of the union had called upon him and
requested that he . remove the firm's
horses and rigs, from the Nevada sta
ble. No threats were made and, seeing
no reason for changing stables, he told
the union men that he would not com
ply with tlteir request.
M. S. Rose, one of Pk-rce's non-union
employe*!, working upstairs in the sta
bjp, heard the word "scab" used by
those calling out in front of the place
of business and said that Monroe, the
union captain of pickets, was louder in
his expressions than any of the others.
WANTED HORSES REMOVED.
Police Orticer J. F. O'Shea. detailed
to look after the trouble at the Ne
vada stable, said that he had seen the
attempt to interfere with the loading
of manure and had heard a man in a
gray suit say to the non-union em
ployes: "We will get you." He or
dered the man away. The officer es
corted the non-union men to their
meals and waited outside the restau
rant to take them back. Before that
time meals were brought to the men
at the stable, but they objected to the
quality of the food. Attorney Van
Ness suggested that it was because
they were being served from a union
restaurant. On cross-examination
O'Shea said that he was not a member
of "eithfr of those unions, the Citi
zens' Alliance or the stablemen."

ESCORTED BY OFFICER,
The Bank Commissioners are having
lots of fun over the distress of the in
corporators of the "interim" banks.
The wiseacres who thought to gather
up a few bushel baskets full of the
coin of the realm through an oversight
of the lawmakers find that they get
only dross. It has all come about be
cause a stanch secret drifted away
from its moorings and floated* into the
hands of people who thought they
might use it too.
When the Legislature wanted to get
rid of Dan Kevane it had to abolish
the Bank Commission to accomplish its
object. Some time elapsed before a
new board was created. Meanwhile
there was no restriction In the matter
of incorporating banks.
A wise man from Los Angeles saw
how he could get a bank franchise for
next to nothing: and sell it at a mag
nificent advance when the law waa
once more in effect and licenses were
difficult to secure. He incorporated six
banks with a capital stock of $5 in each
case. Every member of his family was
a bank president. Then he told a
friend. The friend incorporated a few
banks on his own account and told two
friends. A Sacramento capitalist start
ed four banks with $20. Then Martin
Kelly and his henchmen began to form
banks.
Before the Legislature re-established
the commission there were more banks
in California than in all the other
States of the Union combined. The
combined capital of these financial in
stitutions would not buy a private car
to Boston.
The new Bank Commission appealed
to the Attorney General, but he decided
that licenses must be granted on appli
cation. The banks were licensed. The
Incorporators smiled and waited for
customers. They are still waiting, but
the smiles have disappeared.
"Interim" banks are a drug on the
market. There are too many of them.
None of the I licenses have been sold
and the Bank Commission thinks none
of them can be sold. The price of banks
is now far below par. Martin Kelly has
four of them to cell for $2 apiece, and
he paid 55. The Los Angeles man gives
one bank away with every box of or
anges. The Sacramento capitalist put
his licenses in to stop the break in the
levee last spring.
The public of San Francisco will have
the opportunity of hearing some of the
visiting professors now lecturing at the
University of California, through an ar
rangement made by the trustees of the
Mechanics' Institute.
The lectures have been arranged as
follows: The first will be given
Wednesday. July 20, on "Russia and the
Present War." by Archibald Cary
Coolidge, Ph. D., assistant professor of
history, Harvard University. Professor
Coolidge is considered one of the lead-
Ing authorities on Russia in the United
States. Frederick Jackson Turner, Ph.
D., director of the school of history at
the University of Wisconsin, and au
thor of "The Significance of the
Frontier in American History," will lec
ture July 20 on "The Influence of the
West on the Development of Demo
cratic Principles."
Francis Barton Gummere, Ph. IX, pro
fessor of English at Haverford College,
author of "The Beginnings of. Poe
try," will give a lecture August 3 on
"The Popular Ballad of Tradition,"
with readings from early English bal
lads.
"Faith and Science" will be the sub
ject of the lecture to be given August
10 by James Ward, M. A., Sc. D., LL.D.,
fellow of Trinity College and profes
sor of mental philosophy at the Uni
versity of Cambridge, England.
Tickets for the four lectures may be
obtained by applying at the Mechanics'

Congressional Commission Coming*
The Chamber of Commerce received
a communication yesterday from the
Merchant Marine Commission, ap
pointed by the last session of Con
gress, stating that the body would in
vestigate conditions at this port be
ginning August 4. The commission
will meet at the Chamber of Com
merce and Mil listen to arguments
and reports by the business men of
this city.
The Board of Health made a futile
attempt yesterday to place the blame
on the Health and Hospital Committee
of the Board of Supervisors because
articles furnished to the City and
County Hospital did not conform to the
original samples upon which the con
tracts were awarded and were rejected
on that account. The attempt was
made at the meeting of the committee
to consider the matter of purchasing
urgent supplies for the institution un
der a special appropriation of $5000.
Dr. Ward, president of the Health
Board, stated to the committee that
forty-eight yards of damask furnished
by Murphy, Grant & Co. and 1300
yards of bleached linen from Levi,
Strauss & Co. were of inferior quality
compared with the adopted sample and
had been rejected by Warden Fleming.
Ward Intimated that the committee
was to blame In the matter, but Dr.
d'Ancona, chairman of the committee,
replied that it was the duty of the
warden to. refuse to accept any sup
plies which did not come up to the
samples.
Charles W. Fay, clerk of the board,
explained that the samples were se
lected by the hospital officials and after
the samples had been branded by the
committee its duty ceased. It was then
the duty of the hospital officials to see
that goods of equal quality were fur
nished.
A committee of ladles, consisting of
Mrs. John F. Merrill, Mrs. Smedberg
and Mrs. Beaver, appeared before the
committee and submitted a list of ar
ticles absolutely required for the hos
pital, which were approved. The cost
of the articles, which included bed
spreads, pillow cases, sheets, etc., ag
gregated $4000. The committee decided
to meet at the hospital next Saturday
morning at 10 o'clock to Inspect the
samples submitted.
The committee asked for' permission
to expend $300 of the remaining $1000
In the special fund for surgical imple
ments. A formal petition to that ef
fect will be filed and in all likelihood

Mary Grant told Judge Fritz that a
policeman told her she could sell
liquor without a license so long as she
sold it discreetly, and that her arrest
by another policeman was not owing
to indiscretion on her part, as he wore
plain apparel and acted and talked
like an ordinary citizen In quest of a
drink. The court informed her that
"I was making for the ferry," said
Michael Hlckey in response to Judge
Mogan's Inquiry as to why he waa
found loitering early yesterday morn
ing at Fourth and Market streets and
why a screw driver and a wire cutter
were in his possession.
"What were you making for the
ferry and were those implements used
In the making of It?" queried hia
Honor.
Hickey promptly replied that he was
making haste for the ferry and that
the tools were not employed to ac
celerate his gait. He arrived here
from St. Louis two days ago, he stated,
and was starting to return to that
Mecca of the restless when. his arrest
took place. A policeman, however, de
clared that he had seen Hickey at least
a week ago dawdling on Market street,
and that on Monday night two cigar
stores on that thoroughfare were bur
glarized by means of just such imple
ments as those found in the defend
ant's pockets. So the court pro
nounced Hickey guilty of vagrancy
and ordered him to appear to-day for
sentence.
James Smith, accused of disturbing
the peace of a Montgomery-avenue
concert hall, was reprimanded and dis
charged by Judge Mogan. The specific
offense charged against Smith waa that
he spoiled the intended effect' of a
sentimental song warbled by Miss Jen
nie June, mezzo-soprano, and entitled,
" 'Tls Better to Have Loved and Lost
a Short Man Than Never to Have
Loved at All." As the lady sang the
touching verses Smith shattered the
harmony by butting in with a vocal ac
companiment that was akin to the
bellowing of a bereaved bull calf, and,
as all efforts to silence him were futile,'
his arrest wa3 necessary. The man
agement of the show did not desire, to
have Smith severely punished, at
tributing his conduct to ignorance
rather than malice, and the court was
responsively merciful.*
Philip J. Kelly was pronounced
guilty of failing to provide for his
minor child and Judge Fritz will sen
tence him to-day. He is father of three
children and his wife testified that her
labor alone supports them.
Florian Andre, milkman, was also far
advanced in bewilderment as he tried
to tell Judge Mogan the details of the
robbery case in which he was the com
plaining witness. But his mental con
dition was of alcoholic origin- He al
leged that on Wednesday morn
ing of last week he was way
laid and robbed of a purse
containing about JSO while he was pro
ceeding along Stevenson street, be
tween Third and Fourth, and that the
men who held him up were Edward
Woods, Harry Scott and Edward
Burke. The case was called for hear
ing at 11:30 o'clock Tuesday, but
Andre did not appeaT, and an attach
ment was issued for him. When he
did appear yesterday his manner plain
ly indicated recent over-indulgence In
stimulants, and his testimony was so
incoherent as to make every one con
nected with the trial extremely ner
vous. He confessed that on the day
and night preceding the alleged rob
bery he had been circulating all over
the city, collecting money for milk and
spending it for Intoxicants. The Judge
gave him until this morning to bunch
his scattered wits.
Utterly ignoring the Interruption,
Margery continued her glib narration
to the end and then replied to the
Judge's questions with a promptness
that could not have been excelled if
they had been anticipated. Nor did she
once glance at Mary, whose faculties
seemed to be more than ever befogged
when the case was concluded.
Margery's testimony unchained the
Hansen girl's tongue, but did not cause
visible recession of her eyes. Beings
more antipodal in temperament than
the two young maidens never con
fronted each other. Margery was not
in the least daunted by her environ
ment, but looked the Judge straight
in the face and told her story with as
much calmness as if she were rehears
ing a commencement oration. Mary,
with hands clasped and every feature
reflecting perturbation of spirit, looked
at the unruffled Margery with an ex^
presslon of horror. It was Margery's
assertion that she never heard her
guardian chide Mary that loosened
Mary's organ of speech.
"Why, Margery Joyce," she suddenly
burst out, "you know that's a story,
and you knerw, Margery, how wicked
It is for you to say such things."
Little Miss Hansen, although sup
ported on either side by. the presence
of a parent, was so stricken by stage
fright as she sat upon the witness
stand that her tongue refused its of
fice. She tried to answer the questions
addressed to her in kindly tone by the
Judge, but the best she could do was
to gasp, while her eyes protruded and
her hands trembled. When her mother
attempted to prompt her the defend
ant's attorney thundered a protest that
increased the child's confusion and
when the court upheld the objection
and substituted the matron in the chair
the girl clung to her side. Mrs. Han
sen briefly repeated the complained of
epithets â they - are unfit for publica
tion â and her htfsband earnestly cor
roborated. The defendant asserted that
instead of her having said uncompli
mentary things to any of the Han
sens, she had been fairly deluged with
unprintable remarks by every member
of that family and her foster daughter,
Margery, twelve years of age, was
ready to testify to the same effect.
Mrs. Annie B. Joyce, whose attorney
proudly introduced her as the owner of
five blocks of valuable realty, was
found guilty of addressing offensive
language to fourteen-year-old Mary
Hansen of 375 Naglee avenue and will
be sentenced to-day by Police' Judge
Mogan.
"It was this way," Grace Hummel
tenberg whispered to Judge Mogan as
she leaned across the bench to reach
his ear. ."You see I ain't accustomed
to champagne â a little beer is all I
ever touch â but there waa notning
else to drink at that party and they
would insist. I didn't want to be un
sociable, you know, and â well, I guess
the cop has told you the rest."
Miss Hummeltenberg was notified
to reappear next Monday and ascer
tain whether her story has been sub
stantiated by investigation.
"No snakes?" Inquired the bench.
"It was to avoid them I came here,"
said Smith, "for I knew that another
day of boozln' would be sure to bring
'em. Snakes would mean my finish.
I detest 'em."
After twenty-four hours' total ab
stinence Mr. Smith will be turned
adrift to meet temptation fairly in the
face and laugh at It.
"I was beginning to see things," he
stated to Judge ! Mogan. "The blue
giraffe that followed me from Market
and Kearny streets to the Hall of Jus
tice disappeared when I entered the
elevator, but two pink parrots and a
ring-tailed zebra were with me all
night in the cell."
John Blackwood had a lucid Inter
val and realized that inability to pro
cure Intoxicants would be his only
means of resuming sobriety, so he had
himself arrested 'and charged with
vagrancy.
One day, about six months ago,
Peter Bargonas, teamster, hurled a
heavy rock at the head of a fellow
workman, but the missile missed its
intended mark and collided with the
skull of "W. H. Curtis, a passing citi
zen, inflicting such a severe injury
that Curtis was confined to the hos
pital several weeks. Bargonas pleaded
absence of malicious intent and as
Curtis seemed less eager to prosecute
than to have his doctor's bill paid by
the defendant Judge Mogan contin
ued the case from time to time in or
der to allow a settlement on that ba
sis. For several months Bargonas
regularly paid Curtis a portion of the
surgeon's account, but at last he re
fused to pay any more and it was for
thus violating his agreement that
Judge Mogan yesterday ordered that
he be placed in custody. The case will
be heard next Friday.
Samuel Green, a barber who sent an
obscene picture to a candy girl, was
found guilty of offensive conduct and
will be sentenced to-day by Â¦ Judge
Fritz. The defendant declared that he
did not send the picture and that the
picture he was alleged to have sent
was an advertisement for a patent
medicine and is in unrestricted circu
lation. But he failed to make good his
plea by producing a duplicate of the
advertisement, although he h*id been
given ample time to procure one.

"Early to bed and early to rise" is
not the motto of the lodging-house at
35 Turk street, wherein George Curry,
grlpman, shot and killed his faithless
wife on July 5. When the case of
Curry was called In Judge Mogan's
court yesterday three witnesses who
live in the house failed to respond and
bench warrants were issued for Miss
Martin," Miss Batchelor and Joseph
Deane, all of whom were found asleep
by the officer who went to bring them
in. They were ordered Into custody,
with bail fixed at $10 apiece, and in
formed that if they do not appear this
morning they will be kept in jail un
til the examination is concluded.

Now that this obstacle has been re

immediately. At the meeting last
night the directors voted to install new
showers and baths and to refit the
gymnasium with new apparatus and
add hot an steam rooms to the equip
ment of the club. New plumbing will
be installed throughout the building.
It was at first suggested that the. club
be closed while the work was in pro

only the rooms where the work was
actually going on should be closed.
OAKLAND, July 13. â The Reliance

contemplated extensive improvements
in the quarters of the club for some
time, but the matter has been held In
abeyance until the renewal of the lease
was definitely settled.

SEATTLE, Wash., July 13. â Seattle
got down to work this afternoon and
gave the Dugdale contingent a good
shaking up. For five innings Dug
dale's men outplayed the locals, but
in the sixth they went up in the air
and made all sorts of errors, Castro
and Campbell leading the van. Char

the game. Score:

After that there was no scoring.
Beth teams played sharp, brilliant
baseball and nearly every ball was per
fectly handled. Cooper twirled a mas
terly game for Oakland, but he had
not quite enough of luck on his staff
to carry him through. San Francisco
pulled off four base hits and, strangely
enough, three of these were doubles.
Oakland was slightly crippled by the
loss of Buck Francks, who is suffering
from a bad finger. He will probably
be a bÂ«nch ornament for several days
at least. Dunleavy, however, was back
in the game again and made his pres
ence felt by robbing Tommy Leahy of
a two-bag drive out to the left field in
the seventh round.
Tom Browne, the star base runner
of bygone days and former idol of the
fans at the old Haight-street grounds,
appeared here for the first time as a
caller of balls and strikes. He worked
like a man who knows the stunt and In
every inning was right at the spot
where the most Important play was
being pulled off. The score:

FIELDING IS SNAPPY.
Yesterday Barber used speed and
curves nearly all the time and most of
the opposing batsmen went to their
doom by the fly route. His fast ball
was a wonder and he had perfect con
trol of it all the time. When Schlafley
walked in the first inning the umpire
cave him a little the best of it and had
the latter been a trifle more lenient
Barber would have equaled the world's
record made by the great Cy Young a
few months ago.
Barber was accorded support of the
real 100-proof qualitj*. No one erred
in fielding and Anderson robbed |Dr.
Moskiman of a clean three-bag-gerl by
a remarkable catch In the second in
ning. Meany victimized the doctor out
of a double with another fine stab dur
ing round five when he scooped up a
red hot one that was coming at express
speed and making right for the fence.
Oakland erred twice and the first of
these misplays gave San Francisco her
run and the game. It all happened in
the third. Barber was safe on Schla
fley's fumble, but Waldron forced him
at second. Hildebrand laced a low
rakish boy out along the right field
line. ,The umpire said '"fair ball" and
maybe he was right, but it looked aw
fully close. Waldron tore over the
sacks and reached the pan a fraction
of a second before Byrnes picked up
the ball that Ganley whipped in from
right field.
USES A FAST BALL.
Something more than the return of
the home team was on the boards at
Recreation Park yesterday. It hap
pened in the form of a no run no hit
pame pitched by Barber, the latest ad
dition to the Harris corps of twirling
talent. One Oaklandcr got as far as
third base in the first inning of the
pame. After that it was the same old
tale of one, two, three. Score: San
Francisco 1, Oakland 0.
Barber's feat was the most remarka
ble one ever performed by a pitcher in
this city and one of the greatest that
any twirler ever had the honor to exe
cute. He walked Schlafley in the first
inning, but after that time not one of
his eppononts over got as far as first
base. When Ganley flew to Townsend
Â»nd thereby made the last out a wild
<~heer Trent up from the bleachers and
this cheer was for Barber, the man
discarded by Parke Wilson of Seattle
as one who numbered among those all
in.
It is the second time that, such a
feat has been performed at Recreation
Park. Billy Cristall turned it for Oak
land against Sacramento just two
years ago, but he walked six men In
ihat game and made a wild pitch, so
ihat his feat is not quite up to Berber's
mark. Last November Dr. Newton
shut Oakland out without a run. a hit
or a base on balls, but in that game
Third Baseman Smith made two er
rors, fo that Oakland got' two men od
the bags. /
Last evening Nelson invited a party
of friends for a 'bus ride to San Ra
fael. When near San Anselmo a bold
highwayman waylaid the party and at
the point of a six-shooter demanded
money and jewelry. Dave Barry seemed
to be the only moneyed man in the
crowd and parted with a large sum
and a handsome watch. This morning
Barry's property was returned to him,
but he does not appreciate the joke.
He accuses "Smiling" Mitzner of put
ting up the job, but the smiling one
pleads "not' guilty.
Nelson, Ted Murphy and Dave Barry
took a nine-mile Jog in the morning.
After working half an hour, in the gym,
in the early part of the afternoon all
hands proceeded to Escalle Baths,
where the remainder of the day was
spent.
Battling Nelson spent a quiet day at
his training quarters at Larkspur. The
weather was extremely warm and
trainer Murphy advised Nelson to ease
up a bit, as he does not wish him to
reduce too quickly.
During the last three days Hanlon
has confined his exercising to road run
ning, baseball and swimming. Tester
day he weighed 131 pounds, one pound
above the weight called for in the ar
ticles of his coming contest with Bat
tling Nelson. Eddie Intends to pursue a
different system for making the weight
for his next fight from that which he
has heretofore practiced. In the past
he has kept above the weight agreed
upon until a few days prior to the bat
tle, when he would begin to get rid
of his surplus avoirdupois. He now
plans to be below the weight at which
he is to meet Nelson until a few days
preceding the mill. Then he will com
mence to take on the ounces and
pounds that will meet the requirements
at welghing-in time.
Hanlon is but 19 years of age and
at present tips the scales at less than
he did a year ago. It was prophesied
by some of the little fellow's admirers
that before he was 20 years of age he
would have grown so that It would be
almost impossible for him to make 130
pounds and be strong, but thus far
Hanlon has experienced no difficulty in
fighting at 130 pounds and that without
loss of energy.
Eddie Hanlon will to-day do his first
gymasium work at his training quar
ters at Croll's Garden, Alameda.
He will punch the bag, jump the rope,
wrestle and box with his sparring
mates, Toby Irwin, Frank McDonald
and Joe Angell. The latter Is getting
himself in condition for a main event
to be fought with Frank Rafael be
fore the Sequoia Club of Oakland on
the 26th of this month.

The result of the close finish between
Gay Boy and Major Pelham in the
Jamaica stake to-day was declared a
dead heat and the stake was divided.
Major Pelham drew out on the far turn
and looked every Inch a winner until
Gay Boy was seen overhauling him.
The respective owners agreed to divide
and both racers were offered for sale,
but there were no bids.
The starting to-day was the worst of
the meeting. The steeplechase fur
nished its sensation when Thomas
Hitchcock's Terrible Terry, purchased
by his present owner at Morris Park,
fell at the first jump and was trampled
upon by one or more of the horses
which followed the leader. He has a
chance for his life. Summary:

Whether it was . because James K.
Keene's Toboggan, who ran second to
Irish Lad in the Metropolitan Handi
cap, was meeting horses very much
inferior to those he met in that race
or in the Commonwealth handicap a
few days ago, the fact remains that
in no previous effort of this season has
this son of Kingston been so free in
his action and so full of running as
he was to-day. He handled his 115
pounds with ridiculous ease. "His Read
In his breast" and able at any time, he
ran away from Lord Badge, Sweet Alice
and others whom he was meeting.

The Liverpool dockmen said down in
their husky throats that she had stuck
on the ways to prevent herself from
going Into the water on Friday, and
that she had only been half launched
on that day that is reckoned so falal
to men that go down to the sea In
ships. They recited stories told in the
forecastle with the boiling noises of
wild waves about the bows and the
scream of the gale evhoing out of the
white billows of canvas aloft. Â£o. fol
lowed by her "half-luck" as the old
men of the sea called it, she has had
forty years of sailing through the
storms and calms of destiny. In every
zone that belts the globe she has
fought it out with the tempÂ«st and
scattered spars, sails and bits of her
self on the wind-sweDt waters.
But she has never been wrecked. In
her first voyage from London to Cal
cutta a cape gale flung itself against
her and a foretopgallant mast with
its yards wS.s left drifting around the
far end of the African continent.
While reaching for distant Australia
ghe bowed before the violence of a Horn
zephyr and lay on her beam ends till
it had howled itself out of breath.
When she righted the boats were gone
and the lee rail was floating away
toward the southern pole. On the
present voyage ehe put into this port
leaking and otherwise slightly dam
aged. This is a second jump Into
Delagoa Bay to patch up. For several
years she has been in the leaking age
and has run for innumerable harbors
with pumps clanking and the ocean
bubbling through her seams. But she
waa only half launched on Friday and
the sea can't quite down her. She
Â¦topped on the ways till the unlucky
day was lost In midnight and, along
the line of the old Liverpool dockmen's
prediction, passes through the wreck-
Ing tempests only half wrecked.
When the watchman was passing
through the yard at daybreak he was
amazed to see the vessel suddenly start
down the ways. There was indeed "a
thrill of life along her keel." She took
the wat?r like a duck alone, and no
body was around to christen her ex
cept the watchman, and he was frozen
dumb with superstitious fear.
The shorelines fetched her up and
whf>n the workmen began to gather
in the yard they found the Rokeby Hall
setting high in the stream exceedingly
pleased with herself.
A dispatch from London dateÂ»d July
12 tells that the Norwegian bark Roke
by Hall from "Whatcom for that port
via San Francisco is in Delagoa Bay,
having lost her boats, with bulwarks
smashed by boarding seas and with
part of cargo damaged.
Here is the story the deepsea sailors
w eave around the docks. When she
vas launched in Liverpool a natty iron
l-ark during the latter part of the year
1S63, the day of her dip into the water
fell on Friday. To get the advantage
of the flood tide she was slipped down
the ways late in the evening. She
moved part of the distance, but some
thing went wrong and she stuck hard
and fast. The constructors worked in
the dark till almost midnfght and
knocked off. intending to return early
next morning.

Captain Carl Ackerman of the steam
schooner Prentiss, who dficajtiped with
$600 entrusted to him to- pay his men,
was arrested last night by Detective
Ed Gibson. Ackerman's name was en
tered on the detinue book and he will
probably be charged to-day when his
employers swear to the complaint.
Ackerman, who pilots the ship for
Gray & Co., about a week ago left the
company's oflice with enough, money to
pay off his crew. He never reached the
vessel and for a time the murder the
ory was indulged In. It was found,
however, that the missing skipper was
a heavy drinker and the police were
notified to locate him. Detective Ed
Gibson was detailed on the case and
last night found Ackerman In the baths
at a Hammam Institution on Grant
avenue. He had but 560 out of the $600
left. He says that he will be able to
make good the amount and denies that
he intended to leave the city. "I was
merely on a little drunk," he says.

Marius Peter Pederson Riis is the
fourfold name of a Danish sailor who
was lost from a codfish -catching ves

fog while fishing; in his dory. He was
picked up in a fainting condition from

anese fishing bark Higathi Maru
after he had drifted more than 100
miles to the northwest.
When Rlis was able to travel he was
tent to this port on the W. H. Kruger.
Riis'- tale of hardship follows:
With about twenty-five other fishermen I
vent out at 4 o'oltx-k. as usuai. each
man alone In his dory to catch cod. It
â¢was fllght'y foegy. but the ship's bell

It Is most apparent to me that Captain Al
bert ran his ship at full speed in a dense tog
approaching a port without getting a cast of
the lead until warned by the breakers of hi*
cicse approach to the reef. I must hold that
the local board was Justified in its findings. I
have no patience with the mariner who places
his vessel and the lives of those on board In

lead. >Â» .. ' ,.-;

The argument on an application for
a writ of habeas corpus by Edgar
Bayliss to recover possession of
Constance, his three-weeks-old daugh
ter, from Dr. George H. Jullly, 2518
Howard street, was heard by Judge
Dunne yesterday. The evidence
showed that Bayliss' -wife was In del
icate health and unable to care for
the child, which was taken to Dr.
Juilly's place June 28. Bayliss was to
pay $5 per week to Dr. Juilly.
Bayliss made a demand for the re
turn of the child on Tuesday, but Dr.
Juilly refused to give up possession
till he was paid $10, which he claimed
was due,, him. Dr. Lane, a woman
physician, was instructed by the
Judge to examine the child and If it
was in a condition to be removed to
have,/ it sent to the Children's Hospi
tal, as requested by the parents. Dr.
Juilly got his $10.

tearing down of the building. Con
troller Colgan raised the question of
valuation as regards the $15,000 the in
surance companies carried on the
building. Assessor Dodge objected to
taking an insurance company's valu
ation, as the law guides the Assessor's
office while the insurance companies
may take any risks they wish.
The application of William F. Bur
bank on behalf ot the Pacific Union
Club for a reduction of the assessment
on that property from $162,000 was
denied.
There remains a great number of ap
plications still to be disposed of and
the board adjourned till 2:30 this after
noon.
The second meeting of the Board of
Supervisors as the Board of Equaliza
tion was held last night in the board
room at the City Hall. State Control

NEW TORK. July 13.â A growth of the
eptculative forces at work .in the etock mar
ket was again manifest in to-day's dealings,
which rose well above yesterday's total and
exceeded the flgut-e of last Wednesday, which
haii ntade a record on the movement. The
market was spotty and irregular throughout.
Some of the recent leaders were reactionary
and manifestly h-eld back by profit taking.
Others which were subjected to thin process
in t: v early dealings developed renewed
strength .'ate in the day. Ail. including thÂ»
sustaining etrong points in the early trading,
were moi-6 or less affected by prosit taking
during the day, but the successful taking of
proOts is one of the most important tests of
thÂ«- aclua! strength of a fprculative market.
The conversion Into each of profits on a rise
without materially affecting the advances
caut-ed by the epeeulative buying which caused
the rite is a demonstration of the spread of
tin dtmand and leaves the market in a
stronger i-jeltion by eo much as the absorption
to which lt is to be subjected has been ac
rompliched. To-day' e market was kept ap
parently well in hand throughout. The
sellinK at ether quarters; the wide opening In
St. Paul, at 147 and 147%. and its almost im
mediate relapse jrave bo strong an impression
of manipulation that a party of room traders
maintained a Fuspiclous attitude toward the
market and put out short lines at all stages
of the. advance.
ThÂ» Pacjflrs 'aisumed the leadership In thÂ«
afternoon, and thic led to a revival of talk of
an early decision of the Northern Securities
suit in favor of the Union PacISc contention
and a possible early increase In the dividend
rate. The day's news did not offer any Im
mediate ground for the action of the market.
un!e*Â» it might t>? the large receipts of Jap
iikm' and other gold flowing into New York
banks from San Francisco. But the banks
report a decline In the volume of currency
receipts from the Interior, from which lt Is
expected to be progressive from this time.
Tlie wheat market made decisive response to
fears of crop danzatre from rains, which were
accentuated by estimates of several crop
experts of pome authority. Th* heavy shrink
age In exports of breadstuff* for June again
makes the June domestic exports compare
poorly with th* lart year. The meat packers'*
ntrlk* wzs Ignored. The market was well sus
tained to the laft and the close was fairly
stÂ»-ady.
Ivmd* were firm. Total sales, par value,
$4,300,000.

both here and In the country. The report of
the climate and crop . section of the Weather
Bureau that the crops of Wheat and Barley
were below the average, coupled with the ad
mitted fact that much of this year's grain
will turn out pinched and of light weight, has
emphasized the firmness, and the buyers of
Feed, i Brewing and Shipping, have advanced
their bids, with evident-eagerness to purchase.
Futures were higher yesterday as well as thÂ«
cash grain, owing chiefly to the light re

! The circular of Somers & Co. says: â¢'There

; to market during the past week, the total
! bÂ«ing 3000 tons, or 400 tons less than for the
week preceding. The situation remains prac
tically unchanged here, although there have
been several disturbances of various kinds In
the country. The Stockton district has been
somewhat besieged of late by the Southern
California dealers, and at that point prices
have been temporarily advanced becauae of
j this; so much so that nothing can be mar
keted there to any advantage at present. The
j ffermers at Livermore seem disposed to bold
! fir extreme figures, and we therefore note very
I light chlpments* from that section. ' The same
I Is true of the Holllster district. The Sacra

I tlty of Hay for this market during the next

Local trade In the fruit market was of good
volume and shipping brokers were purchasing
freely of* top quality stock for shipment on the
PugÂ«t Sound steamer out to-day. Choice offer
ings of Apricots. Plums and Trage4or Prunes
in crates were In good demand for export, and
such stock met with prompt tale at or near
the top quotations,' while lower grade offeringa,
which were still plentiful, were easy, with
prices Irregular. ' Fancy Apple* were also la
demand for shipping purposes, fancy Graven
steins packed In 4-tler boxes having the most
call. Bartlett Pears wero easier under In
creased supplies, but moved off freely at the
revised quotations, and some fancy lots of
small green Pears commanded a premium on
the wharf. Peaches were still abundant, but
dealers reported the market gradually cleaning
up. The Hale's Early .variety were selling at
25@3oc per box, while the yellow kinds were
steady at 40Â«je0c. Figs continued to advance
under steadily decreasing receipts and good
sound stock cleaned up quickly. The warm,
sunny weather stimulated trade in Melons, but
Coachf-lla Watermelons I were easier owing to
the competition of the Fresno article, two cars
of which were received. The Fresno Melons
were mostly large and of good quality and
were readily marketed at $1 50^23 per dozen as
to size. A crate of Thompson Seedless Grapes
came la from Dinuba. TuJare County, and sold
for $2. Berries sold off better than for some
little while back, and Raspberries and red
Loganberries did better.
Prices of Citrus and Tropical fruits stood
as previously quoted. Oranges were In good
request for shipment and a car of Valencia*,
which arrived In the forenoon, cleaned up read
ily for that purpose. Two carloads of Central
American Bananas were received, but the stock
wÂ«Â» too Â«rre*n for Immediate use.

CHICAGO, July 13.â Nearly everything In
the way of news to-day 'tended to Induce
strength in wheat prices. Doubt has entered
the minds of traders as to whether the size
of the crop will permit any surplus export.
Orders from the Northwest and Southwest were
abundant and crop reports came from all over
fha winter wheat district. September- was a
ebado lower to %c at 8Â«Â»ic to 8(i%c, and sold
up to 87%c. Foreign advices were bullish. A
gain of 3c a bushel in July wheat at Duluth,
under strong demand from millers* In the
East, was the most potent of the late In
fluences, causing an advance of 2%c in that
option here and corresponding strength in the
other deliveries. Reports of general rain
throughout the Northwest were 'current, the
downfall In the Red Itiver Valley, where the
ground was already soaked, being mentioned
a* especially heavy. Final trades were at
60T4@87c.
The corn market acted independently of the
fine weathet and ruled strong on small re
ceipts and reports of- serious crop damage,
the latter being estimated In some instances
at from 20 to 25 per cent. SeDtember corn
was a 6hade to %c higher at the start at
4SÂ«Jc to 48%<848%c and sold. up to 49%Â®19%c,
closing firm at AQV-c.
The oats market was fairly active and strong.
September opened a shade lower at 31*4 c and
touched 32%e. The advance was well main
tained, the close being but a fraction under
the ton at 32
Wholly at sea as to the outcome of the strike
at the stock yards, there was a disposition
among provision traders to reduce lines: In spite
of large offerings, however, there was a bullish
tendency generally and holders were. able to
sell out at firm prices. Quotations were higher
at the yards and helped the sentiment in the
provision pit. September pork closed 10c high
er, lard was unchanged and ribs gained 2%c
at the close .

The Civil Service Commission asked
for a history of the case and the Po
lice Commission submitted from the
police records that Dolan had been ar
rested in 1890 for assaulting an old
man, but the case was dismissed on
motion of the District Attorney.
Dolan was tried on a charge of per
jury growing out of the assault case,
but he was acquitted of the charge by
a Jury. The Civil Service Commission
notified the Police Commission that in
the face of the record it could not ap
prove of the refusal to appoint Dolan.
The Police Commission accepted the
dictum of the Civil Service Commis
sion and appointed -Dolaa. ,
The' appointment of M. J. Dolan as

was made last Tuesday night because
the Civil' Service Commission Insisted
that it should be made. The Police

ADDITIONAL! CONTRACTS
FOR INDIAN SUPPLIES
"When the purse was handed to Sil
verstein upon his return to the hotel
he discovered his loss and accused the
Japanese servant of having extracted
the money. The matter was reported
to the police and Detective Wren was
detailed on the case. Stulz and K.
"Wanda, the Japanese servant, were
taken to the police station, but after
being questioned by Chief Wittman
were released, as Silverstein would not
swear out a warrant.
The general supposition Is that Sil
verstein dropoed his wallet while going
through the hall and that some of the
roomers found it, extracted the money
and placed the wallet, with the ticket,
under the mat. The money consisted of
$800 in $100 bills and $125 in smaller de
nominations.
Silverstein has delayed his departure
for Germany and In the meantime the
police are working on "the case. Sil
verstein formerly conducted an adver
tising and loan business at 116 McAl
lister street.
John Silverstein, who has been resid
ing at the St. Paul House at 463 Ellis
street for the last four months, was
going to his old home in Germany yes
terday with $923 in his Inside pocket,
but when he went to the ferry to check
his trunk to New York he discovered
that his money was missing. He had
paid for his ticket on the steamer and
also for his transportation to New
York. The latter ticket he had with
him, but his steamer ticket was In* a
wallet which he had had in his inside
pocket when he got up in the morn
ing.
Just as SiLverstein discovered his loss
he was called to the telephone at the
ferry baggage room and notified that
his wallet had been found at the St.
Paul House. Highly elated, Silverstein
returned to the St. Paul, but when thÂ«
wallet was given him he found that
his money was, gone.
. Silverstein a"rose early yesterday
morning and was considerably excited
over his contemplated trip. He packed
his trunk hurriedly and was anxious
for the expressman to come and take
it away. A short time after he left
the hotel "William Stiilz, who attends
to the elevator during the night, found
a wallet under the front door mat
?while sweeping, and upon investigation
discovered Silversteln's ticket to Ger
many therein. Stulz knew that Sil
verstein was at the depot and at once
called him up on the telephone.
Just before the body of the man
who committed suicide in Golden
Gate Park Saturday afternoon was re
moved from the Morgue yesterday af
ternoon a^woman called and viewed
the remains, but would not give her
name or say that she recognized the
dead man. The visitor was recognized
as Carrie Dixon, the woman who fig
ured in the Nora Fuller case as the
friend of Charles B. Hadley, who was
suspected of having committed the
sensational murder more than two
years ago. The fact of the Dixon
woman's refusing to give her name or
say anything after she had viewed the
remains gave rise to the rumor that
8he had identified the remains of the
suicide as her former companion,
Hadley.
From a pawn ticket found in the
pocket of the dead man it Is supposed
his name was L. J. Hanley, but that
fact has not been established. The
suicide was a younger man than
Hadley and had light brown hair,
while the f ucitive has dark hair mixed
with gray. The body, has been turned
over to the city undertaker for
burial.

UNKNOWN PARK SUICIDE
NOT CHARLES B. HADLEY
Suit for possession of various securi
ties valued at $63,950 and $10,000 dam
ages for the wrongful withholding
thereof was brought in the Superior
Court yesterday by Elizabeth G. Mes
ser through her attorneys, Samuel M.
Shortridge and Robert -B. McMillan.
The defendant is Thomas R. Hayes,
formerly manager for Main & Win
chester, and father of Charles E.
Hayes, deceased. The plaintiff alleges
that on March 24, 1903, the defendant,
without her consent, took possession of
the property in question and when she
demanded it from him on July 7 last
he refused to give it up.
These securities are alleged to have
been deeded by Charles E. Hayes, son
of the defendant, to Mrs. Messer short
ly prior to Hayes Jr.'s death, caused
by a fall from a buggy on March 23.
Young Hayes was riding with Mrs.
James O'Connell, daughter of Con
gressman Loud, through Golden Gate
Park at midnight. The vehicle was
overturned and Hayes was fatally in
jured.
Besides the property which Mrs. Mes
ser demands, she received $10,000 on an
insurance policy which young Hayes
had secured in her favor. She was to
have married him in September, 1903.
Mrs. Messer was formerly the wife of
Nat T. Messer, the stock broker.
The securities named are: Five hun
dred and twenty shares in the Port
land Cement Company, 800 Tonopah
Consolidated Mining Company, 1000 To
nopah Light and Power Company, 150,
100 shares of 1901 Oil Company and four
bonds of the Standard Portland Ce
ment Company, valued at $1000 each.
All these are alleged to have been
deeded to Mrs. Messer by the younger
Hayes as tokens of his affection for
her. The father of the unfortunate
young bon vlvant took possession of all
his son's effects. When Mrs. Messer
applied to him for the securities which
the son held in trust for her, Thomas
B. Hayes gave her some non-negotiable
bonds which were in her own name.
The securities demanded are said to
have been Inclosed in an envelope
which bore Mrs. Messer's name. These
were negotiable and Hayes refused to
turn them over.
Mrs. Messer says she waited until
July 7 of the present year, believing
that Hayes would ultimately deliver
the property. Then she made a per
emptory demand, which was refused,
and suit was instituted. Hayes is not
in town.

As a last resort Miss Fisher applied
to the police and Mary Proctor was ar
rested on Tuesday. When Judge Con-
Ian heard the charges and saw photo
graphs of the babies â gaunt, hollow
eyed and more pitiful than pictures
from any famine country â he express
ed a regret that the maximum sentence
for such an inhuman offense was' only
six months in the County Jail.
The father, Charles Proctor, a strik
ing stableman, was sentenced yester
day by Judge Mogan to the same term
of imprisonment. The society will ap
ply for guardianship papers over the
three children. Already the little ones
are gaining flesh under the care of the
Associated Charities and wondering
how they came to fall Into such a par
adise. Dr. Howard thinks that there is
hope even for Gladys, now that she
will receive proper nourishment and
can see the sunshine occasionally.
The case was brought under the no
tice of the California Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Children
about a month ago. Secretary White
sent Dr. Howard-and Miss Lucy Fisher
to investigate. They found the elder
daughter, Gladys, almost in the last
stages of consumption and the other
two children naked, unkempt and un
dersized from the effects of slow star
vation.
Secretary White tried to awake any
spark of the maternal Instinct that
might be in Mrs. Mary Proctor, the
mother. He begged, pleaded and threat
ened, but to no avail. Miss Fisher
made daily visits to the hovel with
nourishment and medicines for the
babies for one entire month. All that
time the wretched mother was in vari
ous stages of intoxication.
"Let her alone," she often remarked
of her eldest child, Gladys; "she's got
consumption and she'll die anyhow."
For some weeks Miss Fisher tried to
bring back to the creature some realiz
ation of a mother's duties, but drink
had made her less responsible than an
animal.
More brutal than pages of Zola and
more touching than any Dickens story
of neglected children is the history of
the three little Proctors, Gladys, aged
6; Edith, aged 4, and Georgie, aged 22
months. For two years they have been
cooped in a wretched hovel at 260 Ship
ley street, starved, neglected and for
days entirely forgotten by their be
sotted parents.
Sometimes neighbors, who scarcely
eked out an existence themselves,
would carry food to the babies, some
times the irresponsible parents would
be sober for a few days and the little
ones would be given a few morsels of
stale bread soaked in water, but often
they would cry themselves to sleep
with gaunt hunger gnawing at their
vitals.

It is an assured fact that the Su
preme Court has been inoculated with
the germ of industry. The rate at
which decisions are beingr ground out
of the interior offices on the top floor
of the Parrott building is # a marvel to
Jurists. Last year the court was six
months behind; this year it is two
months behind. There has been noth
ing like it in California Jurisprudence
in the last decade.
If this celerity is maintained liti
gants may yet live to see final decisions
in cases that they themselves have
instituted. Heretofore men have gen
erally had to leave their litigation as
a legacy to heirs, who have in turn
helped the struggling legal fraternity
to keep, its feet and passed on.
The law says that decisions must be
rendered within ninety days of the
time the cases are submitted or the
Justices cannot collect their salaries
of $500 a month each. For years the
jurists have been collecting their Janu
ary pay in August and when they re
tired they had money coming until
they could get a case.
But there has been an innovation.
The decisions come down so fast that
the secretaries can only take short va
cations and there is enough work in
the clerk's office to keep the deputies
working overtime.
In seme of the Eastern States liti
gation can be commenced in the Supe
rior Court and ended in the Supreme
Court within a few months. A civil
case in this State often lasts three
years. The Supreme Court, however,
has an unusually heavy July calendar
and the secretaries fear that there will
be further arrears in salaries by Sep
tember.
The solution of the difficulty is the

MONTGOMERY-AVENUE BONDS
A wireless telegraphy war is about
to be Inaugurated between two depart
ments of the Government. San Fran
cisco is to bÂ« the headquarters of the
commanders of the rival forces. The
combatants will be armed with masts,
batteries, codes and electricity. The
costs of the conflict will be defrayed by
the taxpayers of the United States.
The public cannot expect to have either
Eide acknowledge defeat until the
"sinews" are exhausted. There will
be a boom in the copper, zinc and acid
?llnes of business while the struggle is
,on. The atmosphere on this part of the
coast "will be so full of electricity be
fore it is all over that the manufactur
<ers of medical belts will have to close
: <lown.
Professor McAdie of the Weather Bu
reau watched the wireless telegraphy
â¢experiments of the military authorities
at their stations on Alcatraz and at
the Presidio and decided that he could
do better himself. He secured an ap
propriation and installed a system be
tween Point Reyes and the Farallones.
The experiment met with success and
Secretary Wilson of the Department of
Agriculture was highly elated. Mc-
Adie received numerous congratulatory
telegrams and when he asked for an
cther appropriation his request was
jgranled. At present he Is working
Jiard en the system and is making
much progress.
The navy had had a mast on Goat
Island and another at Point Bonita,
but after many months of labor the
only means of communication was by
mail. Then McAdie's success was an
nounced and the Navy Department se
cured an appropriation for the estab
lishment of a station on the Farallones.
Since then the Goat Island station has
proved effective in communicating with
chips at sea,
The navy uses the Slaby-Arco system,
which is the method approved by the
German Government. The Weather
Bureau system is similar to that em
ployed by Marconi. Both departments
Tvill soon be sending wireless messages
to and from the Farallones and all
kinds of official secrets will be made
known. The Weather Bureau will know
â¢when the Pacific squadron gets its or
<lers to attack the Afghanistan navy
and Admiral Dewey will discover in
January "what the prospects of rain
may be for the Farallones in June.
Unimaginable complications may fol
low.

pany in Salt Against the State

Huffs Will Is Contested.
Alice Maud Huff, sister of Harry S.
Huff, -who died January 19 last, yes
terday filed a contest to his will, which
was admitted to probate on January
21. Revilo S. Huff, a brother, was
named in the will as executor and sole
legatee. Another brother, Charles C.
Huff, is an heir at law. .
The sister contends that at the time
of making his will, September 17,
1903, Harry Huff was weak in mind
and body and subject to the influence
of his brother. She further declares
that he did not sign the will in ques
tion. . The estate is worth only $1597
end the chief asset is an ark of five
rooms in San Francisco Bay, worth
$1000.
Harry Huff was once a Chinese in
terpreter in the Federal Court and it
vas supposed that his accumulated
â¢wealth was much greater than the sum
set forth in the inventory of his estate.
