BERLIN, Jan. 25. â As the German
Government understands the present
situation, the feeling is such in Tokio
that Japan will declare war unless
Russia answers her demands favor
ably. Russia recognizes this and ac

Japan's points to make the Tokio
Cabinet feel that a sufficient cause for
war no longer exists, and. while the
forthcoming note will not fully satisfy
Japan, it will prevent the serious pos

WILKESBARRE. Pa., Jan. 25.â There
was little relief from , the flood at
Bloomsburg, Catawissa and Espy to

It appears. that one of the most dif
ficult features is the mutual distrust
and hatred which have grown up be
tween the parties. It is said that
every statement of the present ex
changes develops Japan's suspicion of
Russia's good faith and Russia's an
tipathy to Japan. Owing to this bit
terness, diplomatic efforts to secure, a
middle" ground are proving unusually
difficult.

control over_ the narrow, strait. It is

PARIS, Janfio. â Considerable ten
sion is observable in Governmental
quarters concerning the^Russo-Japan
ese situation. This is due principally
to the fact that the efforts toward a
pacific adjustment have not made the
progress which the officials hoped and
expected. The general view of those
highest in authority is summed up in
the statement that negotiations have
now reached a point wlaere practically
no progress is belns made in any di
rection. Whether this means that Rus
sia's latest answer dqcs not make con
cessions which arc likely to bring
aboufa settlement it is impossible to
say, as the delicate stage of- the nego
tiations prompts the officials to with
hold precise details. The only state
ment is that the negotiations are.vir

There was only one dissenting vote
in committee and that was cast by
Underwood of Alabama. T\nderwood
reserved the right to oppose the mile
age appropriation in the House. This
lie Trill do, and if the bill pass he will
refuse to accept the amount due him.
The contention of the majority of
the Committee on Appropriations is
tfiat Senators and Representatives are
entitled to two allowances for mileage
because Congress was called in- extra
session in November, while the pres
ent is the regular annual session pro
vided by the constitution. Those who
oppose the scheme take the ground
that it is a clean "grab," which Con-
KTess can. but should not. vote itself.
This is argued on the ground that the
extra session merged into the regular
session: that In reality there is only
one session and that the mileage al
lowance provided by law did not con
template any such proceeding as now
proposed.
Whether there was a "constructive
recess" or not has little moral bearing
on th*Â» rase, as it was infinitesimal in
the matter of time and it was not pos
sible for any member of Congress to
fro to his home and return again. As
mileage allowance is mr.de to cover
the exp-nse of coming to and going
from Congress it is held that the extra
miWg* proposed is entirely contrary
to the intention? of the law.
At the beginning of tne Â«*xtraordi
xiarv passion in November a joint reso
lution was adorned making the annual
mileage allowance for tl-.p regular ses
sion available nt that time. Those
xrho are urging the present "grab" ar
#ru<? that if anr wrong was done it was
In the passage of that resolution and
that the mileage for the regulnr ses
sion must be provided for now. as
otherwise every member of Congress

ernment.

Whether Congress will vote itself an

Nov.- Bailey charges that Coe caused
to be drawn and signed a false affidavit
in which a notorious woman whom he
had never met confessed to having
held unlawful relations with Bailey.
That affidavit, which. Bailey asserts,
was shown to his wife, turning her af
fections from him, is the basis for his
suit for damages.
Charles W. Bailey Is vice president
and treasurer of the Bailey, Banks &
Riddle Company, prominent Jewelry
merchants of â¢ Philadelphia. He
is a man of large fortune and
has been well known in eo
ctcty in Philadelphia and New York.
He and Coe, though now bitter enemies,
were for years chums. What brought
about the present enmity is known to
few besides themselves. Tt closely fol
lowed the marriage oÂ£ Bailey to Coe's
sister. â¢ â¢ /
This is the third suit brought, by
Bailey against Coe, the previous two,
based upon the same conditions that
the complainant now alleges as the
cause of action, having been discon
tinued upon the discovery of new evi
dence. The present suit was begun on
January 13. and Coe, having been ad
vised of the action, was expecting ar
rest.
Coe was arrested at his office on
Front street this afternoon by Deputy
Sheriff Walgering, who took him to the
Sheriff's office, where he was detained
an hour while his bond was being ar
ranged. Judge Gildersleeye. in the Su- (

Special Dispatch to The Call,
As soon as the rumble of the explo

startled the little village the wives and
PITTSBURG. Jan. 26.â Between ISO
and 190 men are lying dead in the
headings and passageways of the Har
wick mine of the Allegheny Coal Com
pany at Cheswick as the result of a
terrific explosion yesterday morning.
Cage after cage has gone down into
the mine and come up again, but only
one miner of all those that went to
work in the morning has been brought
to ths surface. The rescued man is
Adolph Gunia, and he is still in a semi
conscious condition at the temporary
hospital at the rude schoolhouse on the
hillside above the mine.
In addition to the miners who were
at work when the explosion occurred,
Selwyn M. Taylor, the Pittsburg min
ing engineer, who platted the mine and
who was the first rescuer to reach the
bottom after the explosion, is also
among the dead. At 2:25 o'clock this
morning his body was brought to the
surface. He evidently had been dead
several hours.
ATTEMPTS AT RESCUE FAIL.
The explosion occurred at 6:20
o'clock yesterday morning. The first,
warning was the sudden rumble un
der ground and then a sheet of flame
followed up the deep shaft. Both
mine cages were blown through the
tipple twenty feet above the landing
stage, and the three men on the tipple
were hurled to the ground. The in
jured men were brought at once to
this city, where two of them died
later.
"I was with Taylor and we clambered
over three or four falls. Taylor had
laid out, the mine-and. seemed to know
the way. There was one man alive at
the foot of the shaft. lie was sent up
and then we took the mule path into
the south level. We saw two men who
were alive and notiGcd those back of
us and then went on. We passed the
third, fourth and fifth heading and
then through an overdrift into the air
shaft. I began to feel dizzy and sick
and then I saw Taylor stagger and fall.
His lantern fell. We tried to lift him
up, but could not carry him and I made
my own way to safety."
Thomas Wood, one of the first of the
rescue party hauled to the surface,
said:
Shortly after 5 o'clock Selwyn M.
Taylor and one of his assistants sig
naled for the engineer to lower them
into the shaft. Taylor never returned.
Three times efforts were made to reach
him, but not until early this morning
was his body recovered.
children of the men below rushed to
the scene of the disaster. There was
no way to get into the deep workings.
The cases that let. the men into the
mines and brought them up again
when the day's work was done were
demolished. All day Ions there- was a
jam of waiting women and children
about the mouth of the pit. There
were calls for assistance and for sur
gical aid from the men in charge of
the mine, but it was not until 4 o'clock
in the afternoon that the first attempt
at rescue was made. This was a fail
ure, as the two men who volunteered
were driven "back by the foul air.

WASHINGTON. Jan. 25. â Count
Cassini, the Russian Embassador, had
a long talk to-day with Acting Secre
tary of State Loomls on the Far East
ern situation. The question which
received most attention was the un
contradicted statements which have
appeared in certain newspapers re
garding the attitude of this Govern
ment. The Russian Government' - of
course, could. not presume to Question
the previous assurances received from
this country regarding its neutrality
because of any newspaper publication,
but the recurrence of these statements
has proved annoying.
There Is no expectation on the part
of this Government of any hitch in
the reception of our Consuls in Man
churia. The evidence of approval of
the commercial treaty which Russia
has given convinces the State Depart
ment that the Consuls will receive
every courtesy.

SAN JOSE, Jan. 25.â Julius H.
Ruger, a former prominent attorney
and a pioneer of California, was found
dead in his home in' East San Jose

ter, who called to visit him. He was
last seen alive Saturday. He was a

New York and 70 years of age. His
wife died a few years ago.
Ruger had not practiced law for

CHICAGO, Jan. 25.â Hearing of the
cases of Frank and John Jager, offi
cers cf the Model Gold Mining Com
pany and formerly connected with the
Jager Oil Company, who are charged
by Government officers with misrepre
senting their properties In advertising
matter sent through the mails, took
place before United States Commission
er Foote to-day. More than $300,000 is
Involved in the case, according to Post
office Inspector Ketcham, In eharjre of
the case.
James J. Hardln, former superintend
ent of the Jager Oil Company, and John,
H. O'Grady.a former director and stock
holder of the Model Gold Mining Com
pany, were important witnesses for the
Government.
O'Grady told how the Jager brothers
"boomed the stock" of the Jager Oil
Company. He said that one of tha
brothers went to Evanston, Wyo.,
where the company's "properties"
were located, and registered at the
hotel ns David Williams. Then Wit
ness Hardin said the mining promoter,
under the alias of Williams, offered
him $1000 an acre for the property. A
report of this offer was sent to Chicago
in a telegram, which, was reproduced
and printed in advertising matter sent
through the mails, the witness said.
O'Grady testified that at first it was
planned to send him to Wyoming to
make the "offer," but that Jager after
ward decided that as he was lame, "ha
might be recognized."
J. J. Hallhan testified that Frank
Jager save. him 1250 shares of stock
and that when the promoter offered
him a dividend he remonstrated, but
that Jagrer replied: "That's all right;
keep the stock and when the price gets
hish. enough sell a little block and

ST. LOUIS. Jan. 25.â From dawn un
til night snow fell without cessation
and it is apparent that the fall will
continue throughout the night. Streat
car schedules were abandoned and
every effort was made to keep the cars
running regardless of time. All of the
snowplows in the city were brought
Into requisition. At the Union station
all in-bound trains were reported late.
The St. Petersburg correspondent of
the Daily Telegraph cables that he has
learned it was the erroneous idea of
Bezobrafeff, leader of the war party,
and a Secretary of State, that Japan
would rather withdraw her demands
than fight, which led to divided coun
cils in the Russian Government, and
when war seemed unavoidable he still
persisted that a short and a sharp
struggle would end the matter. He
even ventured to criticize the plan of
campaign of War Minister Kuropatkin
and the War Office and proposed a
plan of his own.
The War Minister then threatened to
resign, according to the correspondent,
and Count Lamsdorff and Witte, re
spectively Minister of Foreign Affairs
and President of the Committee of Min
isters, protested. Finally Grand Duke
Alexander, who had first brought Be
zobrafeff to prominence, became con
vinced war must be avoided, and he
managed to get Bezobrafeff away.
The Tokio correspondent of the Times
says the leading Japanese journals con
tinue to be skeptical of Russia's pacific
intentions and argue that the patching
up of a hollow peace would be a pre
lude to future rivalry in armaments
which would cause a greater strain
than a war, whereas a fight to-day
would be a preface to many years of
peace.
Other dispatches say that the Jap
anese are embarking 10,000 laborers at
Tientsin, in order to hasten the com
pletion of the Seoul-Fusan Railroad.
Some anxiety has been expressed in
St. Petersburg regarding the military
movements of China.
The principal danger now, according
to this dispatch, is said to be confined
to the disorderly elements in Korea.

Continued From Page 1, Column 7.
At 2 o'clock the relief train had not
arrived, but was making its way slow
ly over the drifted track and in the
face of a blistering snowstorm.
Engineer John Nunns of the accom
modation train stuck to his post and it
is believed he is under the debris, as he
cannot be found. Accommodation Con
ductor McKay is reported seriously in
jured and Fireman Frank Heit and
Baggageman Willett were scalded by
escaping steam. One of the Pullman
cars has been turned into a temporary
hospital.
Â¦ Because of the burned bridge traffic
is suspended until a temporary struc
ture can be erected. The local train
was the Hannibal accommodation, due
in St. Louis at 8:29 o'clock and was
running about on time at a speed of
twenty miles an hour.
ST. LOUIS, Jan. 25.â The Denver ex
press, on the main, line of the Burling
ton road, due here at 6;35 p. m.. was
run into from the rear by a local pas
senger train while taking water at Gar
deen Creek, about forty miles north of
here to-night. It is reported that some
deaths occurred and that several train
men were hurt.
The wreck occurred on a bridge over
Gardeen Creek. The bridge and two cars
of the local train- and the local engine
were burned. The express was running
behind time- because of the blizzard
weather, and had stopped at a tank"
Just after clearing the bridge to take
water.
Suddenly, without warning, the local
train crashed into the rear of the ex
press train. The light passenger cars
of the local train were badly demolished
and the bridge was filled with debrK
which took fire. Word reached St.
Charles, eight miles distant, and as
sistance was immediately sent from
there and a wrecking: train was dis
patched from here, followed by a relief
train with physicians.
A long distance telephone message
from St. Charles at midnight was to
the effect that the rear sleeper of the
Denver express stood on the bridge
when the collision occurred. The sleep
er was smashed, but not demolished.
The local train locomotive was crushed
and set fire to the bridge and the
structure and two cars of the local
train were burned. The express man
aged to draw the damaged sleeper away
from the flames.

The presiding Judge said he would

then adjourned.
* : *
Why -had not Lord Pelham Clinton
and others been placed by the side of
Wright? They were equally responsi
ble with the defendant. Counsel con
tended that while the directors may
have made mistakes, it could not be
believed that they were guilty of these
charges. He pointed out also that the
Attorney General had intimated that
Wright had been selected to bear the
whole blame, because he had fe^j
friends.
"He is almost an American citizen,"
said Mr. Walton". "He spent his early
life in the United States, where he ob
tained such Credit as can be obtained
by honesty, industry and Integrity. His
only friends in London are such as
have gathered around him in the course
of his industrious life."
LONDON, Jan. 25.â On the resump
tion to-day of the trial of Whittaker
Wright, the company promoter, on the
charge of fraud, Lawson Walton ad
dressed the jury for the defense. He
complained that the prosecution had
been conducted with the same "undis
guised vindictiveness that had marked
the proceedings of persons who inspired
the prosecution." Had Lord Dufferin
and Lord Loch been alive, counsel
continued, Wright could not have been
prosecuted except in conjunction with
them, and the prosecution would not
have dared to charge those noblemen
with falsehood and fraud as they had
charged Wright.
The Ventura County law library has
just added 190 volumes of Supreme
Court reports to its collection, now 1500
in number.
A very valuable collection of old
books and paintings has been offered to
the public library of Los Angeles by
the Rev. Juan Caballeria, pastor of
the Church of Our Lady of the Angels.
In this collection are twenty-six paint
ings and forty volumes, which are il
lustrative of the early history of the
Southwest. The expense incurred in
collecting them amounts to $1000 and
the gift is conditional upon the pay
ment of that sum to the donor.
As the library is without funds to
secure the offering it seems probable
that the money will be raised by the
citizens of Los Angeles.
The latest oddity in the construction
of a library building is to be seen in
Derby, Vt.. where a beautiful building
presented by Mrs. Martha Harkee la
located on the boundary line between
the United States and Canada, half of
the building being situated on each side
of the line.
In San Mateo the library trustees
have received an offer from Mrs. M. B.
Brittain of San Francisco of a com
plete set of the "Review of Reviews,"
from 1891 to 1902. The offer has been
accepted and the collection will be
bound, v
Among the recent purchases made by
the Pasadena library are a number of
valuable sets of works. One is com
posed of twelve volumes on modern en
gineering; another is on Oriental sci
ence, illustrated by exquisite engrav
ings/ those on Japanese art being espe
cially fascinating.
Phoenix, Ariz., has received from
Andrew Carnegie an offer of $25,000 on
the usual conditions. This offer takes
the place of one formerly made of only
$15,000. ri
The Los Gatos library has estab
lished a charge of, $1 for the use of its
books by those that live beyond the
city limits.
Chico has been favored with its long
expected gift of $10,000 from Andrew
Carnegie. Eighteen months ago Chico
had no free library. A few earnest cit
izens'brought the subject by petition
before the City Trustees, procured the
passage of an ordinance for the estab
lishment of a library and at once ap
plied to Mr. Carnegie for a donation.
Traveling libraries are in greater de
mand among the teachers of Missouri
than with the women's clubs of that
State. This is a recent report from the
Missouri State Federation of Clubs.
As a memorial to a little son that re
cently died, John Patton of Grand Rap
ids, Mich., will provide and maintain a
collection of books to be sent to crip
pled children.
The citizens of .Santa* Cruz are mak
ing great efforts " to provide , ample
funds for the furnishing of their library
structure, now under way. A large
committee is to be appointed to arrange
lor the giving of concerts, theatricals
and lectures in this behalf.
W. R. Watson, formerly connected
with the Carnegie Library of Pittsburg,
Pa., recently appointed assistant State
librarian, has arrived at Sacramento
and assumed his new duties.
Prompted by a zealous desire to know
what best points are to be found in the
new library buildings of California
A. W. North and Lawrence Stephens,
library trustees of Woodland, are mak
ing, at their own expense, an extended
trip of inspection. They will visit the
libraries of San Jose, Los Gatos, Palo
Alto, Oakland, Alameda, Napa, Santa
Rosa. Vallejo and others. Their special
object is to promote utility and ele
gance in the plans now being drawn
for the Woodland library. ;
The . Oakdale library has just ob
tained through Representative J. C.
Needham more than thirty valuable de
partment works. Some of these are
from the geological survey of the De
partment of the Interior and are de
scriptive of the resources and possibil
ities of Northern California.
The Superintendent of Public Instruc
tion In Rhode Island, Mr. Stockwell.
declared . in a recent, meeting of * the
State Library Association held in Paw
tucket, K. I., that public libraries mean
almost more to the education of the
State than the schools themselves, if
conducted as they ought to be." They
are a means of education of the peo
ple. He concluded with the words.
"Don't be discouraged; you have en
couraged me to the undertaking of
things that I never thought of be
fore."
Rarely is a Carnegie library opened
with more public satisfaction than the
one just completed in Kalispell, Mon
tana. Kalispell is located in the north
western part of Montana, not far from
the Canada line, in a mountainous and
sparsely settled region. The building
is of brick with sandstone trimmings,
interior finish of maple and cost $10,000.
To celebrate the opening, a reception
was given by the ladies of the library
association.

carefully investigate the merits of this medicine and then honestly
tell the public the truth about it.
1 want every dyspeptic to try Paw Paw. No matter what rem-
edies you have taken or. what doctors you have consulted; no
matter how many years you have suffered, get a trial bottle and

Berlin Receives Report of Dis
astrous Attempt by Troops
to Helievc Fort of Okahandj.i
The situation in German Southwest
Africa has been made more serious by
mutiny on the part of the native po
lice,- workmen and prisoners at Malta
hoehe. The mutiny occurred during
the absence of the commander, who
had joined the expedition against the
Bondelswarts tribesmen. The muti
neers seized rifles, money and cattle,
but the mutiny was subsequently sup
pressed.
The garrison at Windhoek numbers
230 men, part of the force being horse
men, with two machine guns.
Light has been thrown by the Frank
furter Zeitung on some of the contribu
tory causes of the Hereros' rising in
German Southwest Africa, as the result
of statements made to that paper by a
traveler who . has just returned from
Windhoek and Okahandja. The mer
chants and the traders allied with them
are charged with purposely involving
the natives in debt. According to this
traveler the traders are mostly dis
charged soldiers, whom the. merchants
equip with wagons and from sixteen to
twenty oxen and goods valued at thou
sands of marks. The traders sell at first
entirely on credit, not requiring any
cash until they make later trips. ThÂ«!
improvident natives buy largely and
repeatedly on these easy terms, and the
merchants favor the system by extend
inc and renewing the credits of the
traders, sometimes to 15,000 marks. Tho
traders finally begin collecting portions
of the debt, taking cattle in payment,
and at the same time selling Â¦ more
goods on credit. The natives are often
indebted to several traders at once. The
Frankfurter Zeitung's informant adds
that he found the merchants took an
average of 70 per cent profit on the
transactions of the traders, and the
latter added 100 per cent, and usually
made 2Q per cent more on the cattle
which they took in payment. The trad
ers further aroused the anger of the
natives by seizing the latter's cattle
arbitrarily without waiting for legal
procedure. It is true that the authori
ties forbid this, but the natives usually
do not complain, merely nursing their
grievances, and if they do complain the
polic6 have difficulty in discovering the
offending trader.

studies in theology until ordained by
Bishop Gailor of Tennessee to the dia

Ordained a priest by Bishop Sessums of

HELENA, Mont., Jan. 25. â Judge
James H. Beatty of Idaho, who heard
the pleas of abatement in the perjury
and subornation of perjury cases
growing out of alleged frauds in tim

Montana, has sent to the clerk of the
United States Court here his decis'on
in the case, in which the pleas are
overruled. The opinion is in the case
of the United States R. M.

perjury, but by stipulation of counsel
the decision holds as to all perjury and
subornation of perjury cases.
There are twelve indictments against
Cobban for perjury â five against John
B. Catlin for subornation of perjury;
also one for perjury and one each
against thirty-eight other residents of
Western Montana. They were indicted
about two years ago, it being alleged
that they had committed perjury in
proving up on timber land entries
which were afterward transferred to
Cobban and by him transferred to

BEDFORD, Ind., Jan. 25. â Officials
here are anxiously awaiting, the de

ing the death of Miss Sarah Sehaefer
subsequent to the return of Joseph
Heitger from Bloomington.
In response to a telegram from H.
Hahn, a cigarmaker of Louisville, who
declared he could conduct officers to
a woman who might be able to throw
light on the mystery, Chief of Police
Russell and Sheriff Smith went-; to
Louisville to secure an interview with
the woman. The officers interviewed
her and claim to have secured valu
able information. Before disclosing
the information, it is said, the woman
exacted a pledge from the officers that
her name should be withheld from
publicity in connection with the inves
tigation. .;â¢
Mrs. Frank Goss of Chicago, who is
at Elkhart to attend the funeral of her
sister, declares that Heitger is the man
to whom she referred in her letter
when she said she was sorry that '"he"
had made a "crack" at Miss Sehaefer
and that the latter had not the
strength to throw him down. She and

question of appointments to office made

a result of the debate on the appoint

specific information concerning the
nomination of W. D. Crum as Collector
of Customs at the port of Charleston,
S. C, was passed. A resolution asking
for similar information concerning the
nomination of Brigadier General Wood

As showing the tenacity of his opin
ion, it is said one of the first acts of
the new Governor on taking his place
at Manila was to incorporate in the new
navigation laws for the Islands a pro
vision used by the preceding Spanish
Government based on the very princi
ple in the contention for which he had
been defeated by Secretary Root. The
latter also is tenacious, for he immedi
ately struck the proposed law out of
the Philippine code.
Secretary Moody to-night gave a
farewell dinner at the Metropolitan
Club to Secretary Root.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 25.âPrepara
tions are being made at the War De
partment for the transfer of the Sec
retary's office from Secretary Root to
Secretary Taft. The new Secretary will
arrive Wednesday afternoon. Secre
tary Root has issued cards for a recep
tion Friday evening in honor of his
successor. The Thursday evening pre
ceding Senator Alger will give a recep
tion In honor of the retiring Secretary,
at which Governor Taft will be present.
The fact has developed that Secre
tary Root himself originally selected
Governor Taft for the important post
of Governor of the Philippines, and the
reasons for the choice are interesting.
Mr. Vanderbllt had purchased abroad
the big steam yacht Conqueror, and
when the vessel came to New York
the Customs Collector sought to im
pose a heavy duty on her as an im
ported article. Mr. Vanderbilt retained
Mr. Root to defend the case. The pres
ent Secretary and Mr. Taft, then So
licitor General, met in the legal arena
of the United States Supreme Court,
where Mr. Root won his case. But the
argument made by the Solicitor Gen
eral excited his admiration, and when
Secretary Root cast about for the best
man for the delicate and difficult post
of Governor of the Philippines he chose
Mr. Taft.

* LIST. OP SUBSCRIPTION'S. .
OAKLAND, Jan. 25.â The people of
Linda Vista have taken the matter of
municipal improvements into their own
hands, and when the city of Oakland
announced its intention of supplying
much needed fire protection for that
aristocratic neighborhood the people
upon the hill decided fhat they would
have a firehouse in keeping with the
architectural condition of the hill dis
trict. The result is the first municipal
ptructure in the city of Oakland the
design of which has been furnished by
the citizens of the neighborhood. The
plans for the new firehouse for that
section were presented to the City
Council to-riight, and a lesson In mu
nicipal improvements has been given
not only to Oakland, but to the State
at large.
In the regular course of Oakland
events it was decided that Linda Vista,
which is the district in which reside
United States Senator Perkins and sev
eral hundred other wealthy residents
of Oakland who are known even better
outside than inside of their home city,
should have fire . protection. A flre
house was to be built and an engine
installed. The residents of Linda Vista
looked with horror upon the ussal barn
like structure that is called a "fire
house," and they decided that they
would have something of their own
style, even if they had to pay for it
themselves.
. 'GIVE IiOT AND PLÂ»AXS. .
Some time ago it was deemed advis
able to make certain changes in the
regulations governing the driving of
autos. The Merchants' Exchange
fathered the move and persuaded the
â¢Alameda automobilists to meet It half
way. To-day's action by the Board of
Supervisors is the result of a joint rec
ommendation from these two bodies.
While the speed of machines has been
increased, the rules of the road laid
down are: The right of the road must
be taken in passing vehicles; in meeting
an' animal chauffeurs must at a signal
from the driver slow down to six miles,
and at a second signal from the driver
they must stop still long enough to al
low the vehicle to pass.
Fifteen days from date a new auto
mobile ordinance will go into effect in
Alameda County that provides for an
increase of the speed at which chauf
feurs may run their machines from fif
teen to twenty miles an hour under cer
tain restrictions. The new ordinance
was passed to print by the Board of
Supervisors to-day. The changes in the
regulations are the outcome of a con
ference held by committees from the
Merchants' Exchange and the Alameda
Automobile Club.

There is. nothing on his person that
gives any clew to his identity. George
Warren, the night watchman at the
stables, states that in making his
rounds at 5 o'clock he discovered him
lying in a stall beside a horse. He says
the man must have entered the barn
for the purpose of finding a place to
sleep and was kicked by a horse.
At the Receiving Hospital Drs. Strat
ton, Kane, Kelly and Emerson were
somewhat skeptical as to the wounds
having been made by a horse's hoof.
The police. have taken up the matter
and are making an investigation.
The injured man is supposed to have
come from Tacoma. He had a pro
gramme of the Edison Theater of that
place, with the name Chickering writ
ten on it. There was also a time card
of the Tacoma, Seattle and Interurban
Railway, with the address 634-636 Clay
street. The injured man is apparently
about 45 years of age. f<
An unidentified man was found lying
near the heels of a horse in the stables
of the Oakland Gas, Light and Heat
Company, at First and Jefferson
streets, about 5 "o'clock this morning.
The man was suffering from three
wounds on the head that will probably
result in his death. His skull is frac
tured near the base at the right side.
He was unconscious when found and
remained in that condition throughout
the day.

Berkeley Office San Francisco Ca'.l,
214S Center street, Jan. 25.
Professor Allen C. Wright, professor
of mechanics at the University of Cal
ifornia, found out for the first time yes
terday that it is a violation of uni
versity law to shoot off firearms en
the university ground?. A police officer
was the first man to tell him about it
and to make it all the more impressible
ihe minion <>f the law put the professur
und^r arrest.
The professor protested vigorously
when ihe officer attempted to put hand
cuffs on his wrists, just as if he was
any old common malefactor. He said
he was merely practicing at a target,
which he thought was out of range of
the university. His wife, who was help
ing him waste the ammunition, corrob
orated his statement, but the constable
whs obdurate, though he did agree to
forego the manacles.
The constable escorted the culprit
into thp presence of A. I... Bolton, su
perintendent of the grounds. The su
perintend?nt was as inexorable as his
lieutenant. He found the professor
guilty right then and there and flx^d
th* bail at $10. In lieu of which he
would have to spend the night in tin
County Jail. Protests of all degrees -A
Umperature did not avail with the au
tocrat of the university park.
At last, however, Professor Wright
hit upon the idea of surrendering his
gun as bail and after a lot more of
palavering Superintendent Bolton
agreed to accept the weapon.
When President Wheeler heard about
it to-day he immediately ordered Pro
fessor Wright's release, so that he was
spared the humiliation of sitting in ihe
dock in Justice Edgar's court, along:
with the roprular Monday morning
crowd of misdemeanants. At the same
time Mr. Wheeler promulgated an order
that hereafter first offenses against uni
versity law shall not be punished.
Two boys that were arrested for
'Â¦shooting craps" on the grounds were
not favored with the same attention as
Professor Wright. In lieu of bail tlvy
spent the night in the Covyity Jail, but
this morning were dismissed on the or
dei of the District Attorney.
Held up by two men who pretended
to be policemen, robbed and t&ra
thrown into a dark cellar and bound
are the items in a tale of troubles
which John Kerrigan, a Berkeleyan.
related to-day to the police as having
befallen him during a belated trip Sat
urday night through Oakland.
Kerrijan is a bit hazy as to details,
but he la positive that he lost $14 and
a watch during his encounter and wa3
given a lively experience to boot.
According to his plaint the Berkeley
wayfarer started on an electric car* at
11:30 o'clock p. m. for the college town.
but the car did not make the through
run, so Kerrigan decided to return to
Oakland. En rout* he says twd men
followed him from a saloon at Twenty-'
eighth street and San rablo avenue
and declared they were policemen. Th~
pair, he says, placed him under arrest
as drunk and dragged him into/a va
cant house, took his. money and watch
and left him bound hands and feet iu
the basement. Kerrigan explained that
he freed himself and crawled away,
but he could not locate the house for
Detectives Shorey and Holland, "who
are at work on the case. Kerrigan re
sides at the Acheson Hotel, Berkeley.

Meese explained he was In favor of
the ordinance, but voted no, out of
deference to the desires of residents
of the West End of the Fourth Ward.
Thereupon Evans made his speech;
interjecting some comments on what he
termed "gag law."
Wallace if. Alexander, president of
the Aloha Club: J. C. H. Stut. T. T.

Adam, Howard. Pendleton, Wallace,
Dornin.
Noâ Messe, â¢
"It appears that Mr. Evans has for
gotten himself," said Councilman
Elliott. "He should- comport himself
with more respect to the ' president.
Without asking him to apologize,
which. I believe he should do, I . will
second the motion."
"I believe the president was right in
his actions," declared Councilman Pen
dleton, "but I think we should hear Mr.
Evans and I move he be heard."
"l.know my orders," said the police
man, "and you will go," and out of
the chamber Evans was hustled. Presi
dent Dornin at once resumed the chair
and reconvened the Council, directing
the lobby to be cleared of those who
were yelling. The roll was called and
quiet restored.
EVANS GIVEN HEARING.'
Evans took advantage of the con
fusion in the lobby and among the
Councilmen by yelling -that a mass
meeting be called.
"This room .belongs to you now,"
shouted the former Councilman, "and
we shall hold a mass-meeting to pro
test against this ordinance. The first
thing to do is to nominate a chairman."
At that Policeman John Sherry
stepped up to Evans and ordered him to
retire. -
"I know my rights," declared Evans,
"and I won't go."
Carrying out his threat previously
made. President George W. Dornin
called the Council adjourned and or
dered Evans off the floor: But the
command to adjourn being irregular
and intended as a call* for recess, \v;us
not heeded -by the Councilmen, none
of whom left his seat.
Several protesting citizens had been
heard when Evans appeared and. said
that his voice was raised against the
constitutionality of the ordinance. As
soon as the objection was raised voices
in the- lobby yelled "Gag law." and
Evans joined in the din of yelling and
hooting.
ADJOUUXS MEETING.
Notwithstanding much excitement
and disturbance, with the incidental
ejectment by the police of former
City Councilman Taliesen Evans
from the floor of the Council cham
ber, was the final vote reached. Evans
was forcibly removed from the hall
because he attempted to make a
speech against objection from Coun
cilman Cuvellier. The lobby was
packed. with residents of West Oak
land, there to protest against the new
site.

SCOTT'S EMULSION.
NO SECRET.
There is no secret about
Scott's Emulsion of Cod
Liver Oil. The label tells
the whole story. There is a
knack in making it. The
only secret about it is the
secret of its success.
This year, when cod liver
oil is very scarce and high,
all kinds of cheap, inferior
oils are used to take its place,
and all sorts of things. pre-
sented as substitutes. Think
of petroleum being taken as
a substitute for cod liver oil I
â too absurd. Think of the
so-called wines, extracts and
cordials of cod liver oil!
â they are simply the shadow
without the substance,; no
food value in them.
Scott's Emulsion â '" The
Old Reliable" is the same
yesterday, to-day and forever.
Its quality and purity can
be absolutely depended upon
at all times.

Mrs. Lavinia M. Johnson, an or
chardist of Lawrence, Santa Clara

some time last Sunday night by illu
minating gas. Her dead body was
found In bed in a natural position yes

was filled with the deadly fluid. The
window was closed on account of the
coldness of the night and the door
was closed, but not locked.
The discovery was made by Mrs.
Kate Waters, Mr. Deane's mother-in
law, who traced the odor of escaping
gas to the room occupied by Mrs.
Johnson. On the bed p lose to*the hands
of the dead woman lay a novel, which
she had been reading before she fell
asleep.
Mr. Deane informed Deputy Coroner
McCormick that he believed the case
to be one of suicide, but he was un
able to give any tangible reason for
his belief, all the facts being Incon
sistent with that theory- He said
that Mrs. Johnson retired at 10 o'clock
on Sunday night in the best of spirits.

Mayor Schmitz declined after the
meeting to discuss the report. As the
power to remove is vested in the Mayor
by the charter it is not likely that his
Honor will oust his own appointees on
the Health Board from office. The di
rection to the Auditor not to audit
the demands of the new employes of
the board would seem to be futile, as
the charter empowers the Auditor to
approve all demands, unless the Civil
Service Commission should file notice
of its disapproval of the same.
CHARTER IS VIOLATED.
The testimony clearly ehowed that the mem
r-c:iÂ« of lhÂ» Board of Health rave to the posi
tions created by them designation* different
from those that had already been selected ty
the Civil Service Commission for the express
l.urno'se of violating: and evadlne tte civil
service provi'ions of the charter and as the
nnlv mean* of removing from office employes
that had beer, duiy certified to byâ tJie Civil
Eervfoa Commission and of replacing them by
ar-iointces of their r.wn selection. Instead of
ReefcJnK th<?lr anpeintees from the eligible lists
thÂ» BoenUof Health resorted to a change of
d'esU-natJon as a method of substituting the
spoils wfMtem for the system of competitive ex
amination required by the charter.
\cccrdtBK to the new rules adopted by the
toard of Health on January 1) the resident
phvsician of the City and County Hospital is
to bo selected from tbe internes of that hospi
tal nr>cn cor:rÂ»etitlve examination. The im
propriety of entrusting to a recent graduate in
medlfire. whoee solo purpose of residence at
the ho?rital i" to acquire experience in his
profession, with the responsiblliy for the lives
and health of the sick community. Is obvious.
To leave a hospital of over 400 patients from
rÂ» o'clock in t^e afternoon to 8 o'clock In the
morning every day of the year, without the
presence of a physician or surgeon of even one
year's exoerience in medicine amounts to ab
solute Inhumanity.
The economy Is almost entirely confined to
thÂ» list of civil service positions, the salary
roll of which has been reduced J24,G0O. On the
other hand, the salary roll of the list of
offices r.ot under civil service has t>een In
creaÂ«ed J13.C0O. The nÂ«t *avine to the city
for the remainder or the fiscal year will be
$4500. Every consideration of public cafety
demands that the qualifications of every m Â»n
appointed to th* Denaiiment of Health should
be carefully scrutinized by the appointing
power. Much depends upon the individual rf
flciencv and Integrity of the appointees in the
correct edministraticn of the health affairs of
the municipality. Economy by all means. But
economy at the expense of the health and lives
of the "people of the city never. And is th?
motive for economy genuine? The circum
stance that ail of the pt>-called economy was
effected In the civil eervice department and
that the salary roll in the non-civil service
department was almost doubled leads your
committee to distrust tfce P l *Â« ot economy.
True economy dots not consist in a blind re
duction of expenses, but only In a wise reduc
ti'-ii of <nieh cipentes consistent with the
proper administration of health affairs. In
view of the fact that the qualifications or th*
men *or>ointed and or those deposed were un
known to the hoard. therÂ« is not a sugges
tion of evtdence to show tbe wisdom of these
reductions.
The testimony of Dr. Hushes is an illustra
tion or the fact that the qualifications of the
men who wer> removed from office and of the
men w'.io were appointed to office were un
known to the Board of Health, in view of
which it i5 Impossible to believe that the effi
ciency of the department was for a momen
considered.
Th* testimony shows that a number of the
poÂ«itiot.s. created under new titles, are iden
tical in ranee and nature of duties with the
positions abolished and which had been filled
by aDnointment from the eligible lists. That
the assertion that these changes were mad* in
the interests of efficiency is a. mere pretense,
not to be B'rlously considered for a moment,
the most Kuoerflcial reading the transcript of
thÂ«> evidence will demonstrate.
The report says:
CREATION OF POSITIONS.
The vote on adoption follows:

"This report may condemn." said
Brandenstein, "but it condemns justly.
There never was such a barefaced,
open violation of the charter as that
carried out by the Health Board. The
members of the board openly testified
that they did not know the men whom
they had appointed and had never seen
them, and yet they displaced civil ser
vice elisibles with those men." -
Boxtc-n's motion that the considera
tion of the report lay over for one week
was lost by a vote of six ayes and
tv.-elve noes.
That tl'e Auditor and thÂ» Treasurer bÂ« di

"When D'Ancona moved the adoption
of the report Lunstedt objected on the
ground that the matter had not been
thoroughly threshed out in committee
and there were seme portions of it
which he did not favor.
NOT TO AUDIT DEMANDS.
The joint Committee of Finance, Civil
Service and Health filed with the Board
of Supervisors yesterday its report of
the investigation of the wholesale re
movals put into effect by the new-
Health Board, in which it recommend
rd among other things that the Health
Board be immediately removed from
office on the alleged ground that it has
violated the civil service provisions of
the charter.
The report, after some debate, was
adopted by the vc-tes of fourteen Su
pervisors. The findings of the commit
tee are as follows:
Tour committee rerreta that the Hmlti of
the jurisdiction of the Board of Supervisors
make ft impossible for tUat board to take as
efOctive artion in ths oreaiises as is deemed
warranted by Its findings. Your committee iÂ»
or the ocinion that the maladminlÂ»tra,tion of
the affair* of the Health Department of the
city by the Board of Health Justifies and de
mands the immediate removal of that board.
Confining- Its recommendations upecifleally to
action viithln the province of the Board of
Supervisors, your committee recommends that
your hcnorable body declare that the following
named nersons hold the position* riven oppo
site their names In violation of the civil ser
vice ) revisions of the charter:
I.r-::s tarry, deputy health officer: G. W.
Goodale. WaltJr Jackson. C. A. Glover and
M. J. Walsh, inspecting: physicians ; J. F. Dil
lon, A. is. Adler and Frank Tillrnan. district
health officer*: Henrv Miller and James Rea
der, factory irsoectors; James P. McQualdo,
assistant warden and custodian: B. I*. Ebr
lick, receiving secretary; A. M. Currle, assist
ant superintendent.
Representatives of various clubs
made brief addresses, stating thÂ» needs
of their neighborhoods, after which the
meeting adjourned.
Mayor Schmitz arrived while Mr.
Rosenthal was speaking and was "wel
comed with hearty applause. He said
that he had come to the meeting chiefly
to be Instructed regarding the needs of
the neighborhood and Incidentally re
ferred to the civil service uproar at
the City Hall, explaining that all
changes were made purely in the inter
ests of economy.
At the conclusion of the Mayor's
speech X. B. Greensfelder Introduced
the following resolution, which, on mo
tion of George L. Center, was unani
mously adopted:
"Resolved, That the opening of Mar
ket street from Seventeenth to the
ocean is a public necessity and that
the Board of Supervisors be urged to
take immediate action toward that
end."
Behrend Joost w-as the first speaker
of the evening. He said that ha had
always hoped to see Market street ex
tended to the ocean, and, although he
is no longer a young man, he expects
still to live long enough to have his
hopes realized. He was followed by
Colonel E. D. Eerri, who addressed the
audience on similar lines.
Marcus Rosenthal, the next speaker,
fired a little hot shot at Callfornlans
in general and San Franciscans in par
ticular, who, he said, were too prone to
procrastinate.
At a mass meeting held under the
auspices of the Federation of Mission
Improvement Clubs at Twin Peaks
Hall last night resolutions were adopt
ed urging the extension of Market
street from Seventeenth and Castro
streets to the ocean.
J. D. MKJilvray was granted a per
mit to lay a spur track on the north
side of Tuwnsend street, between

THE attitude of certain Senators and of certain
Democratic papers toward President -Roosevelt is
suggestive of reminiscences. They are spreading the
idea that the President is rash/ impulsive, sudden in his
conclusions, unsafe and likely to plungethe country into
trouble. They accuse him of lack of reverence, for the*
constitution and '.being-; unmindful of his duty. Alii this is
intended to obscure his honesty, his frankness and the
force of character which have beeirtjie motive power of
.his administration. He has not scrupled to do right, to
enforce the law, to invoke its vengeance oil the grafters
and boodlerS of his own. party. He has done in these
respects all that a year ago it: was charged that he would
not dare do. and now because he has done it the same
men charge him with rashness.
It is the Panama matter that has set the opposition on
edge. They see the constitution in pefil, liberty . run

President has followed all of his predecessors in recog
nizing a de facto Government. But in doing this; he has
followed strictly every executive "' and judicial precedent

RUSSIAN HILLâ A Subscriber, City.
In the earlv days of California, Ions
before the Americans settled in thi3
part of the American Continent, a
number of Russians occupied a part of
the territory along the coast, particu
larly In what is now Mendocino, Marin
and San Francisco counties, and there
were some that had a settlement at the
bottom of the 3lope opposite that which
is known as Telegraph Hill. -As late aa
1S49 there were still to be seen on the
slope facing that hill a few graves sur
mounted by black crosses and bearing
Russian inscriptions, evidently the rest
ing places of .some of the Muscovites
who had sojourned in the old village.
The discovery of these graves by
Americans while going over the terri
tory, before the days of gold, gave rise
to the name Russian Hill to the emin
ence above the graves." a name that ha3
been maintained to this day.
It is suspected in Washington that Germany is schem
ing to secure a harbor in Santo Domingo and that she is
coquetting with the turbulent little island republic with
designs neither honorable nor discreet. In these modern
days of greed and grasping it is a pity the earth is so
small. Uncle Sam may be forced some day to send a
few. of his friends to another planet, where with other
clothing for their spirits they may fight their war ambi
tions into submission. ' . . .

CONGRESSMAN GROSVENOR, in presenting to
the House a bill authorizing the appointment of
a commission to investigate the conditions and
the needs of our merchant marine engaged in foreign
commerce, said: ' "We flatter ourselves that we are a
leading nation in all that makes a nation great, and yet
we are a subservient nation and a helpless nation in
one of the great factors of national wealth and national
independence. Other nations carry our products to the
markets of the world and exact from us a tribute for the
Mr. Grosvenor estimates the amount of the tribute we
pay to foreign ship-owners at $200,000,000 annually. Our
standard as a shipping nation is shown by the following
statement of the ocean tonnage of the leading mercan-
United States 873,000 tons

-France 1,480,000 tons
Norway v. ..1,660.000 tons
Germany 2,960,000 tons
British Empire .' 14,800,000 tons
We have a -larger foreign trade than any other people,
and yet we have a smaller merchant marine than any
other mercantile nation. As a consequence we have to
pay the heavy annual tribute of which Mr. Grosvenor
spoke. The proposed commission recommended by
President Roosevelt will not have much difficulty in find
ing out the cause of this disparity between our trade
and our ships, for it is patent on the surface of things.
The foreign ship-owner has cheap labor in constructing
his vessels and in operating them, and, in addition, he has
a subsidy from his Government. How can the American
ship-owner compete unless the Government give to him
the benefit of that fostering care ..which has been so
beneficially extended to every American industry on

Sores Sponge Fishers.
Experiments are being made at La
Goulette, Tunis, with a new submarine
vessel, invented by Abbe Raoul, the
Vicar General of Carthage, to be used
in sponge fishing. The vessel is made
of steel, and resembles in shape a huge
porpoise. The entrance to the central
chamber is hermetically closed by a
heavy lid fastened with screws, and the
occupants survey their surroundings
through port holes. A long spear ter
minating in a grappling hook, worked
from the Interior of the submarine,
seizes the sponge and deposits it in a
net at the side of the vessel. The craft
is propelled by electricity fiirnished by
accumulators through a cable attached
tea vessel on the surface, with which
It is in constant communication by
means of a telephone. The vessel is
lighted by electricity, and a lamp hang
ing in *he bow lights up the surround
ings while the sponge fisher Is beneath
the water. Three men may easily de
scend in the vessel at the same time.
The *.bject of the vessel is to reduce the
great mortality among sponge fishers.

Reasoning frcm the principles of the
pretty generally accepted nebular hy
lÂ«othcsis the eud of the world is to be
i eat lied very gradually through the in
creasing reijrn of fold and the length
ening of the earth's dcy. For it is evi
dent that the sun cannot keep on radi
ating heat at the present rate, or. in
deed, at any rate, forever. As Lord
Kelvin has well paid, we knov.- that the
run is cooling off just as certainly as
we should know that a hot stone which
ve encountered in a field was cooling
off, though we had not seen it long
enough to measure the rate of its cool
.ing;. H*=>at is not a permanent quality
of any known object. The sun must be
losing its heat, and hence in time will
become a cold and lifeless object.
If things continue to go on as they
now do, astronomers tell us, the. sun
will lose its life-giving heat long be
fore 12.000,000 years have elapsed. Like
all other cooling bodies, the sun must
be diminishing in size. Its diameter
must be contracting. Xewcomb esti
mates that in less than 5,000,000 years
th*> sun's diameter will contract to one
half its present length, so that the sun
will occupy only one-eighth of the space
it now occupies. It is hardly possible
for it after that to continue to furnish
as muoh heat as it now does, but it
must then cool off with great rapidity.
Th:s reasoning is based on the suppo
sition that the sun is not yet a solid
l>qdy. but is so hot that its mass is still
in a gasHius state. But the force .of
gravity uix>n the pun is so great that
the fras is compressed into a much
smaller proportionate compass than it
is on the earth. The force of gravity
on the surface of the sun is twenty
seven times that on the earth, so that
a man weighing 150 pounds on the earth
would weigh nearly two tons on the
Fun. So great is this pressure of grav
ity on the gases of the sun that they
are reduced to one-quarter the density
of the solid nucleus of the earth. But
fo long as the nucleus of the sun con
tinue? to be paseous it will continue to
prow hotter as it diminishes in size. So
soon, however, as it loses sufficient heat
to allow the material to take on the
soifd form, a crust will be formed and
the radiating heat will rapidly dimin
ish. Probably also the heat radiated
will diminish long: before that time,
even though the sun is growing hotter,
because cf the diminishing size of tho
..The only wav that Ih** astronomers
can see to avoid this slow paralysis of
the sun. and so of the whole solar sys
tem. is that lately proposed by Profes
sor Langley in a sensational article de
picting what would happen if a dark
world moving at an incredible speed in
space should come so near our sun
that the two would collide. In this case
the original heat of the sun might be
restored, but the catastrophe would
practically produce such an expansion
of its volume and such an Increase of
5ts radiating power that everything on
the earth would be burned up, produc
ing about such phenomena as are de
scribed by the Apostle Peter. Indeed,
the resemblance between the words of
the apostle and the theory of the
Washington astronomer was as strik
ing as it was unexpected, so much so
that some readers may not know from
which source the following quotation is
taken:
"The heavens shall pass away with
a great noise, and the elements shall
be dissolved with fervent heat, and the
earth and the works therein shall be
burned up."
But the suggestion of the astronomer
was pure speculation. There are no ap
parent signs of any such approaching
catastrophe as Dr. Langley suggests
.as possible. At any rate we may settle
down to the conclusion that bo far as
r.stronon":ica3 forces are concerned the
present order cf things will not be dis
turbed for three or four million years.
But an equally gloomy prospect is
before the world in the distant future
from another cause which is in slow
operation. The length of the earth's
day is slowly increasing through the
retarding influence of the tides pro
duced by the moon. To be sure^this
effect is so slight that it has not been
directly perceptible since . accurate
methods of measuring the time of the
earth's revolution on its axis have
been observed. But that It must be
taking place is as sure as that friction
will stop a railroad train when the
steam Is turned off. J
The tides raised by the moon's at- |
traction are distributed by the conti
nents so as to present many anomalies,
but v/ben considered in themselves they
act the same as a wave three feet high
constantly running in an opposite di
rection to the revolution of the earth,
and po by friction retarding its motion.
Astronomers are agreed, that similar
tides i.roduced on the moon have re
duced her revolution on her axis to a
period of twenty-eight days. Eventu
ally the revolution of the earth will be
reduced eo that our day will be several
tln:es longer than now. When that time
comes the nights will be 50 'cold that
nothing can stard It. anJ if they could
the days will be so hot that what was
Inf t by the cold would be destroyed by
the heat. Eut that time, also, is so far
in i th*Â» future that the present genera
1 !on may put it out of their minds.
This catastrophe will not arrive for
many million years yet. Indeed, be
fore that time arrives the saa will have
become so far cooled off that we shall
WHILE listening to the speeches and addresses
following their banquet on Saturday evening
the members and the. guests of the Chamber of
Commerce had no occasion to pray that good digestion
might wait on appetite. The words of the speakers and
the arguments and statistics that supported them were
sufficiently good to promote the digestion of a pessimist
had one been there. Certainly there was abundant rea
son for feeling well over the work of the past and the
prospects ahead, and the banquet may be ranked as one
of the most successful and most felicitous of our civic
feasts. \
Without undertaking a review of the work done by the
chamber it will be worth while to give attention again to
the results of all the energies that have tended to the
upbuilding of our city as expressed in some of the figures
given in the report of President Newhall. Summing up
our industrial and financial advance during the past year
he said:
"This has been an unusually active year in the history
of the cit3', there being 552 more sales and $314,645 larger
valuation than the previous year, which was supposed to
be the banneV year. The mortgages of 1903 aggregate
$30,889,988. while the releases amount to $21,346,699, thus
making the net sum borrowed $9,543,289. In other words,
there was $47,710,157 invested in San Francisco realty
during the year and only $9,543,289 of the total amount
was borrowed, showing clearly that $38,166,868 was ab
solutely new money invested in real estate in the city and
county of San Francisco. The exports from San Fran
cisco by sea during 1903 amounted to more than $50,000,
000 and the imports to more than $36,000,000, showing a
large balance in our favor. Our bank clearances have
steadily increased. While in our annual report last year
we surpassed all other years in these clearances, yet for
the year 1903 we have again taken a step forward, as the
clearances amounted to $1,520,198,692, an increase of $146,7
836,656 over 1902. or more than $12,000,000 per month.
The manufactures in San Francisco during 1903 we esti
mate at a little over $150,000,000 in valuation. While our
customs collections show some difference, they should
have amounted to over $9,000,000 if the duty on coal and
tea had not been removed, but they did actually show
$7,621,160. The population of. the city is steadily increas
ing and is now estimated to be between 440,000 and 450,
000 people."
That is an excellent showing for a community whose
people are reputed to be more busily engaged in finding
fault with one another than in working for the common
good. As. a matter of fact we appear to have left behind
us the old-time fights and jealousies to a very large ex
tent and are now doing about as much co-operative work
as any other city of anything like equal size. Evidence
to the effect can be found not only in the work of the
Chamber 6f Commerce, but in that of the Board of Trade,
the Merchants' Association, the Manufacturers' and Pro
ducers' Association, the Promotion Committee and kindred
organizations. In fact we;:have now developed a fairly
strong spirit of civic patriotism among our leading men
and may confidently count upon an even greater advance
this year than that which has been so creditable 'to us in
the year just closed. y Â¦
Mr. Bunker's report from Washington gives a similar
good report of the feeling among Pacific Coast repre
sentatives there. He says: "The Representatives in Sen
ate and House of the several Pacific Coast States and
Territories are working harmoniously for Pacific Coast
interests. They have learned, through varied experience,
that desired wholesale legislation may only be secured
through united effort. There is a disposition to pool is
sues and pull together. The men .from the Pacific realize
that division of sentiment means defeat; they realize
that the administration, the great departments, the Sen
ate, the House and the bureaus that influence legislation
have been too ofteri halted by prejudiced protests. The
men from the Pacific realize that their respective constit
uencies have a community oi interest. They are no
longer pulled to and fro by local prejudices. They work
together for Pacific Coast progress. It is to-day as it
should be. all for one and one for all."
Reports of that kind fit well to the mood of a banquet,
and they will fit equally well for starting the work of the
new year. They mean business. Bright as are the pros
pects ahead the future is not without clouds upon the
horizon. Much as was done last year, there remains
much more to be done. San Francisco is to have a spe
cial exhibit at St. Louis. That is one of the things to be
taken hold of at once. Governor Brady of Alaska re
minded the merchants that in all their enterprises up to
this time they have neglected the wonderful markets and
fields of Alaska. That also should be attended to. So
the new year has its work ready marked out for it. We
must neglect nothing. A metropolis is not a gift of na
ture. It is the work of human energy wisely, directed,
and surely with the sanguine feeling founded upon what
has been attained in the past our merchants and manu
facturers can meet the difficulties which this, year brings,
with a full confidence in their ability to conquer them and
bend them to the service of the city.
be indifferent to everything else that
happens.
Another limit to the future of the
habitable portion of the ear^h is
brought to light by. the rapid progress
of erosion that is going on all over the
land surface of the world. Wallace
estimates "that one foot of the earth's
surface is. on the average, washed
away by the streams every 3000 years
and deposited at the bottom of the
ocean. This amounts to more than
300 feet in a million years. As the
main elevation of North America is
74S feet, and that of Europe 671 feet,
it follows that by the operation of
present forces JEuroÂ»>e will be washed
into the sea in 2,000,000 years and
America in 3.000,000 years. What
providence has in store for us afti?r
that no one knows. If the sunken
portion shall rise at the end of that
period, as it did at the end of the
coal period, there will be dry land to
live on. but it is doubtful if it will have
such stores of iron and coal as have
blessed the present race of human bc
injrs. /
There are two other sources of heat
to which we may look with much
confidence and hope. It was more
than a dream of Ericsson to invent an
engine which could be run by collect
ing 1 tho direct ravs of the sun thrdugh.
immense sun dials, thus generating the
heat necessary to set in motion the
wheels of industry. But the success
ful carrying out of his plans would
necessitate the transfer of our Kre.it
manufacturing centers to the rainles3
regions of the world, where perpetual
sunshine prevails. It, therefore, wi'l
not be impossible that the desert of
Sahara and the sandy wastes of Cen
tral Asia shall in the future usurp the
place now assumed by the localities in
proximity of the great coal fields of
the world, while the latter become
overgrown with briars and brambles
like the mounds of many an ancier.t
center of civilization. The deserts of
Central Asia, which lie in prox
imity to great mountain systems with
abundant vegetation and water sup
ply, certainly afford attractive situa
tions for such manufacturing indus
tries.
Still another possible source from
which we may draw indefinite quanti
ties of heat and power is to be found
in the heated center of the earth. As
we descend below the surface of the
earth the temperature rises on an
average of one degree in sixty feet. At
a depth of two miles therefore the
temperature of boiling water would be
reached and at a depth of five miles a
temperature of more than 4 00 degrees.
It would therefore not seem by any
means impossible to bore into the
earth deep enough to make a portion
of its heat available for all ordinary
purposes. A stream of water let down
to these depths through one pipe and
brought up in another might be made
to warm a city or to generate steam
enough to run any amount of ma
chinery-, from which electricity could
he developed producing the highest
known degrees of heat for all pur
poses.
The world, however, is concerned
with impending catastrophes nearer at
hand. The prosperity of the present
time is largely due to the rapidity with
which we 4 are using up the reserved
stores of nature upon or near the sur
face of the earth. We have had cheap
fuel for the last half century because
we are having access to coal mines
through new methods of mining and
transportation. The prosperity of the
British empire rests almost wholly on
the freedom with which she is using
up and selling her limited stores of
coal.. Xot only does her coal set in
motion the innumerable wheels and
spindles in her manufacturing towns,
but it goes to all the ends of the earth
for the accomplishment of the same
object. But nothing is more certain
than that this supply is limited and
that before another half century is
over her fields of coal will, at the
present rate of decrease, be exhausted
and England be reduced to the con
dition of a pleasant watering place,
where life can be enjoyed by a limited
number of well-to-do people, but
where no great industries can be
profitably carried on.
Already the 'command of the world's
markets afforded by cheap and abund
ant coal is passing to the United States.
But at the rate at which we are usirg
this precious commodity our own re
serve stores will be exhausted in 200
years, which is a very short time in
the life of a nation. The coal fields of
China, when that conservative country
is opened, will last not much ' longer,
while the coal fields of the world be
sides are hardly worthy to be taken
into account.
What may come from discoveries of
gas and oil no one can certainly fore
tell. But so far the supply of these
precious commodities has proved to
be limited. The supply is kept up by
the discovery of new fields. At the
same time wood, both for fuel and for
other purposes, is disappearing as rap
idly as this wasteful age can use and
destroy it. The timber, supply of the
United States will . be practically ex
hausted before this generation has
passed off the stage, and the next gen
eration will have to build of brick and
iron. The forests of Canada will, how
ever, remain to draw upon for a few
years longer, while those of Siberia
will scarcely do more than supply for
an indefinite time the wants of the
rapidly increasing r population of the
I Russian empire. The forests of China
were Ions ato exhausted. China is a
country of treeless mountains. And
such will the whole civilized world be
soon unless forest culture is resorted
to by the governments. There remain,
indeed, the forests of the tropical re-
Kions to which we may look with hope
for the distant future. But their full
utilization will ' probably involve a
transfer of the centers of population
from the temperate zones to regions
where so far. man has not been able
to so withstand the enervating Influ
ences of a warm climate as to rise to
his highest standard of excellence.

A Gentle Hint.
To men who hunt and shoot and
flsh for the food that sustains life the
statutes on the subject of game pres
ervation appeal with about the same
force that the revenue laws do to a
Carolina "moonshiner."
A State game warden had a call re
cently to invade a remote interior
county of this State, far from the
beaten track. Before the officer left
the railroad station for his long horse
back plunge into tjie forest and moun
tain country he was 'warned against
the sentiment that existed among the
settlers therein against official inter
ference with their pursuit of the
gamy trout or the toothsome deer.
Likewise was the warden informed
that it was a certainty his identity
would be known longf before his jour
ney was half completed.
With these words of counsel the
rider set forth. True to prediction
the warden met . the reception his
friends had prophesied would be his.
On a lonely trail through a brush
buried gulch there was a sudden sharp
"ping" of a rifle shot. Snapped off the
saddle went the horn, severed by a
bullet as cleanly as if done by a saw.
"Whence the missile .came, whose
hand pulled the trigger, are yet to be
told. The significance of the warning
message of lead was so fully Impressed
upon the vigilant game -warden that
he turned around on that pathway,
headed his horse for the railroad and
decided that so far as he was con
cerned the application of the game
laws to that region was a dead letter.
One Touch of Nature.
An editor on one of the, morning
dailies relates an Incident which,
though somewhat comical, has a dash
of the pathetic and goes far to show
that a love of country is still a realiiy
and tingles alike in the breasts of all
men. The editor had a Japanese serv
ant employed at his home who gave
entire satisfaction and seemed well
pleased with his position. A few morn
ings ago the customary signal to break
fast was not received and a visit to
the Jap's room showed that he had
vanished in the night. Pinned to his
pillow was the following note, which la
given literally:
"Dear Master:

in our history. The Supreme Court, whenever the issue
has come before it, has recognized, the Government de
facto of the Confederate States during our civil war. Not
only has it been recognized as a national Government,
but the State and municipal governments, subordinate to
and deriving from it, have been judicially recognized.
The idol of the Democracy is Jackson. The idols of
that party are not elected until they have been dead a long
time. The most eminent Democrats fought Jackson
while he was alive and he had to season in his grave a
long time' before he took his pedestal and had a day in
the Democratic calendar. To this day he is contemned
in his native State, South Carolina, where Jackson day
is passed unnoticed. But he is generally higher in the
calendar, of party saints than any other, leading Jefferson
It is interesting that during his lifetime he was con
demned for the same characteristics that are now
ascribed to President Roosevelt. Calhoun . fought him
with all the venom of his soul. Among Calhoun's leading
reasons was Jackson's invasion of Florida, a Spanish
province, and his practical arrest of the Spanish Governor
andhis threat to supersede him. Predatory Indians were
armed for assault on American settlers on our side of the
line by that same Governor. After a raid they would
return to Spanish jurisdiction and defy pursuit. Jackson,
in military command there, followed them into Spanish
territory and gave the Dons a scare that put an end to
the raids. â¢
On this Calhoun never ceased to harp. ; He cited it as
evidence that Jackson had no respect for international
rights nor, for the constitution. But Jackson made our
border settlements safe and paved the way for the ac
quisition of Florida by the treaty of 1819, and when he
became President had the satisfaction of having under
his jurisdiction the territory that he had invaded as a
soldier.
The Calhouns in the Senate are now practically re
peating the same charges against President Roosevelt,
who has the confidence and support of the country just
as Jackson had. There are reasons for believing, how
ever, that the opposition to Roosevelt is less sincere than
that to Jackson. Calhoun's successor, Tillman, has been
fighting the President; but when asked by Senator
Spooner what he would have done in the Panama case had
he been President replied impulsively: "I would have
said to Colombia. 'You are a mangy lot; get off the face
of the earth; we will take the country and build the
canal.'" That is the real sentiment of all of the Presi
dent's opponents, and their opposition is perfunctory
only, and the country is tired of it.

"I want to sit at the table and sleep
in a good bed," said Naary. "I Hke
San Francisco, and I intend to stay
here. When I made up my mind to
give up my mission yesterday I looked
for a job, but could not find one. Then
I asked a policeman for aid and he
put me in jail." . >
"What kind of a mission Is it that
you have?" asked the Judge.
- "Well," said the soldier of God. "I
carry six books with me. Two of them
are dictionaries of the Knglish - lan
guage, three of them are Catholic cate
chisms and the sixth Is the sayings of
Joseph Smith of the Church of the Lat

"This fellow is evidently 'bugs,' " said
the Judge tersely. "The vagrancy

Michael J. Naary told Judge Fritz
yesterday that he was a soldier of God
and had a mission. For years he had
stuck to his missloni undergdlng al
most Inconceivable hardships. It was
a mission among families, and he trav
eled all around the country and
through it, spreading his gospel. But
he could "no longer carry his burden
and his spirits had fallen through."
"Why, yesterday," he said, "a woman
wanted me to eat my dinner out in the
middle of the street, and last week a
man made me sleep In the barn."
"Where do yqu want to eat?" asked
the Judge.
Vincent Le Corvee, who was held to
answer "by Police Judge Mogan last

before Judge Cook yesterday and was
arraigned. When he was asked to
plead Attorney Cogmet asked for a con
tinuance of ten days. The Judge re
fused it and Gognet asked for five
days, which the Judge also refused.
"I insist upon a continuance," said
Cognet, "and I ask for no courtesy
from the District Attorney. I intend
to argue the question of. jurisdiction,
as I believe the courts of this State
have no right under the treaty be
tween this country and France to try
this man."
The Judge said he would grant a
continuance for one day In accordance
with the law. and the defendant must
be ready to enter his plea to-day.
The defendant was a. sailor on the
French vessel Vercingetorix and is ac
cused of -haying killed Vincent Le

Her evident respectability appealed
to Judge Mogan, and he allowed her
to go without, imposing punishment.
Before doing so he warned her against
late suppers, and told her that next to
late automobile rides he considered

tutions that could be Indulged in.

Joseph Richardson and Tommy Ryan,
two evidently honest young men, were
brought before Judge Mogan yesterday
because they were found early Sunday
morning asleep in the rear of the Em
porium over a grating where steam
exhaled a warmthful atmosphere. They
tcld Judge Mogan that the previous
night they had sought the shelter of the
City Prison as lodgers, and did not care
to abuse the hospitality of the police.
They said they were without funds but
were earnestly looking for work, and
that instead of asking alms they pre
ferred the rough comfort of a warm
grating for their slumbers.
Judge Mogan told the singer that if
he would seek the hay wharf he would
be able to mingle with congenial com
panions, whose souls flame with art,
and that there he could get inspiration
for many a lilt in drinking songs that
would make him a second Villon in the
remembrance of posterity. Ladart
promised to make his bed with the
soulful ones on the hay wharf here
after, instead of in a public park.
Victor Ladart, a poet, who has wooed

John Morrissey, who has given con
siderable trouble to the police because
he persisted in selling liquor without a
license, was given $100 or 100 days in
the County Jail yesterday by Judge

tence was not mltigat'd by his state
ment that he though^ he was selling
cider instead of whisky.
John Moody was bound over to trial
in the Superior Court yesterday by
Judge Conlan In bail of $2000 on the
charge of stabbing Special Policeman
Joseph Gillen out at the Chutes on De
cember 30, while the hamldryas in his
cage chattered and laughed in glee.
Frank Jones is a bad actor, who
made a social call on Ruby Wilson
Sunday night, with his hand wrapped
in a handkerchief. When he was
ready to leave he struck the woman a
terrific blow in the left temple with the
bound hand and ran into the street.
Her screams attracted the attention of
Policeman McShane, who caught Jones.
Under the bandage on the hand waa
found a pair of vicious brass knuckles.
The assailant calmly admitted that he
had hit the woman and said he had
Seen waiting for a month to revenge
himself because she had called him a
bad name. He was before Judge Cab
aniss yesterday and the case went over
for one week.
Another squabble ensued as to who
should have its further custody. In
view of the evanescent nature of the
statement Judge Conlan refused to take
charge of it, because he feared it might
disappear into nothingness before his
gaze. The special attorneys for the
defendants objected to Prosecutor Wel
ler being made custodian of the paper.
Finally Clerk Rice volunteered to take
a chance and the statement was giv>sn
into his guardianship, to the satisfac
tion of all parties concerned.
The testimony taken yesterday chiefly
related to the identification of the dy
ing statement. Detective Harry Braig,
who was present when it was made,
was the chief witness., The statement
practically exonerates Rossi from par
ticipation in the row which caused La
vaglnlno's death. Both defendants
were accused of having beaten and
kicked the deceased to such an extent
that his death ensued five months later
as a result.
Unexpectedly the dying statement
made by Vincenso Laviginino, which
was missed at the fast hearing of the
murder charge against Giovanni Fossa
and Francisco Rossi, was produced in
Judge Conlan's court yesterday. By
what process such an important docu
ment was mislaid was not explained.
Extrajudicially It was stated that the
dying statement had always been safely
in the possession of the District At
torney's office and that its absence at
the first demand for it was due to the
inadvertence of Prosecutor Weller.
Numerous objections were made to
Its admissibility, partly because it had
disappeared and that its authenticity
was seriously affected by that fact.
Another objection urged was that It
was not a dying statement, because the
decedent was not in fear of immediate
death. Judge Conlan overruled both
objections and admitted the document
in evidence.
Policeman Duffy claims to have en
joyed a strenuous time while endeav
oring to arrest Thomas Brown, a milk
wagon driver, Sunday morning on Turk
street, between Van Ness avenue and
Franklin street. The policeman says
that Brown was drunk and disturbing
the peace of the neighborhood, and
when he sought to quiet him the driver
tried to get a decision over him. The
case was called in Judge Cabaniss'
court yesterday, but went over by
consent.
.The Secretary of Agriculture has ap
pointed W. r>. McArthur, whose office
is at 114 California street, as inspector
of dairy exports, and Mr. McArthur is
busily engaged in rounding up and ex
plaining the law and regulations to all
dealers and exporters of dairy products.
The lav/ provides that owners or
shippers of butter, cheese or dairy
products which are to be exported and
who desire to have the said articles
from time to time inspected, and so
marked "as to secure their identity
and make known in the markets of for
eign countries their purity and qual
ity," shall make application to the Sec
retary of Agriculture for such inspec
tion. These applfcations can be filed
with Mr. McArthur. who has been in
structed to give prompt attention to all
such applications.
Shippers' manifests covering these
articles for export or for shipment to
Hawaii. Alaska or other non-contigu
ous territory-of the United States must
also state whether cheese is filled or
unfilled, whether butter is pure, reno
vated or adulterated: and whether
oleomargarine is colored or uncolored.
If adulterated or renovated butter,
shippers must present, at the Custom
house with their shipper's manifest, a
certificate of inspection issued by the
inspector of dairy exports.
The law make3 no provision for the
exportation, free of tax, of renovated
butter, nor for drawback of "tax on
such articles when exported. Conse
quently all renovated butter for export
must be stamped and marked the same
as for the domestic market.
Officers and agents of exporting ves
sels and of all transportation compa
nies by land must not receive any reno
vated butter unless accompanied by
the required certificate of inspection.
This certificate will be issued in trip
licate by the inspector of dairy exports.
Both the original and certifi
cates must be delivered to the exporter.
The original must be attached to the
shipper's manifest for the information
of the customs authorities and after
being checked in the Custom-house
must be delivered with the duplicate
shipper's manifest to the agent of the
export vessel, who will deliver It to the
chief officer of the vessel to accompany
the shipment to destination. The du
plicate certificate should be forwarded
by the shipper, with the bill of- lading,
to the consignee, to be used by the
latter in identifying the shipment at
the port of destination. The triplicate
certificate of inspection will be for
warded to the'Department of Agricul
ture at Washington.
Heavy penalties are provided for
"any person Avho shall forge, counter
feit, simulate, imitate; falsely represent
or use without authority, or knowingly
and wrongfully alter, deface or destroy
any of the marks, stamps or other de
vices 1 *- placed upon or any certificate
prepared for use or used In connection
with any renovated butter.
It is believed that Landlord Neiblas
has not told all that he knows of the
case, and Mrs. de Lareuelle, clerk in
the cleaning works where the gray
suit of Soeder was taken the morn-
Ing after the murder to be cleaned,
still maintains that Neiblas is the man
that took the suit to the place.
Martin, although Captain of Detec
tives?, has not done anything to ferret
out the murderer of Blaise and all
the work of gathering evidence has
been accomplished by Detective Gib
son, under the direction of Chief Witt
man.
The police claim they have enough
evidence against the man they are now
holding: in the City Prison to convict
him of the crime. They argue that
Mrs. Bowers, recently convicted of
poisoning her husband, was convicted
on less evidence than they have
gathered against Soeder.
It is known that Detective Gibson
has some evidence of a startling na
ture that he is withholding until the
case comes up in court. He claims
that it will be unnecessary to prove
the movements of Soeder and his mur
dered brother-in-law after they left
the Original Mexican Restaurant on
Broadway on the night of the murder.
There is enough other evidence, he
says, to prove to any fair-minded jury
that Soeder is guilty of the murder of
Blaise.
The inquest over the body of Joseph
Blaise, who was murdered on Sunday
night, Janaury 10, will be held this
morning at 10 o'clock. It is doubtful
whether it will be completed to-day
on acount of the large number of wit
nesses ihat have been subpenaed.
The police are not ready for the in
quest, but the Coroner has refused to
grant them any more time. He holds
that the inquest must be held before
the preliminary hearing, which com
mences to-morrow afternoon at 2
o'clock in Judge Cabaniss* court.
There is every likelihood that the
Coroner's jury will render a verdict of
murder and officially charged Leon
Soeder. the dead man's brother-in-la*w,
with the crime. At any rate, the po
lice say that the result of the Coroner's
inquest verdict will cut little figure,
one way or another, with the hearing
in the Police Court.
There are more than thirty wit
nesses to be examined to-day and De
tective Gibson expects to have more
when the case cotnes up in the Police
Court to-morrow.

roll. There are conflicting reports of
the amount of money lost. The Police
Department claims that only the In
significant amount of $20 was taken,
but the District Attorneys office claims
nearly $1500 was secured. /
The police suppressed the story of
the robbery until Navarro was ar
raigned in Judge Mogan's court yester
day. It waa stated that the other two^
men were known and could be appre
hended if the crime was kept secret.
Policeman Matthieson pursued Na
varro immediately after the . robbery
and placed him under arrest. No
weapon was found on him and only 50
cents in money. His hearing was con
tinued for one week by request of the
prosecution.
Judge Mogan listened to the story
and. then leaned back and hummed
"What Right Have You on Broadway?"
When the judicial nerves had been sa
tiated withi the melody he convicted
Kelley and will state this morning the
term which he thinks will fit Kelley's
case.
tive of Ireland, was wafted once more
before Judge Mogan yesterday on the
charge of vagrancy. He appeared two
weeks ago and was given only twenty
four hours on a promise that he would
make a burst of speed for a Stockton
boat on which he was employed. He
fell at the first hurdle in the person
of a friend who had just come down
from the mines with a hefty roll. The
Stockton boat and .yie promise made
to the Judge was forgotten, and Kelley
has been treading tFie primrose path
of dalliance on Broadway since then.

Police Judge Cabaniss yesterday is

goods under false pretenses. The com
plaining witness is L. D. Costa of San

diction of that couri, but in case of
his release he will be brought to this
city on the warrant issued yesterday.

"The country, is overstocked to begin
with, but conditions in. any other "event
would be nearly as bad. ,The valley
appears as if it had .been swept by pes
tilence. It also looks as if all ranchers
would be ruined."
Similar reports come from other coun
ties in this section of the State. South
ern California Â¦ received only a small
portion of the copious rains which. fell
in the north. : In this Â¦ city less than an
Inch has fallen this winter. j.-
LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25.â Cattle are
dying by the thousands in Antelope
Valley, in the northern part of Los An
geles County, and unless copious rains
fall soon the loss to stock owners in
this and other counties in Southern
California will be enormous. Conditions
in that section are more serious than
they have been at any other time dur
ing the past sixteen years. Between
5000 and 6000 head of cattle in the
northern part of Los Angeles County
are slowly dying of hunger and thirst.
Their condition is pitiable in the ex
treme. Not only are the cattle suffering
torture, but the financial loss to* cattle
men will be enormous unless the drought
is soon broken by copious rains. r This is
the story of distress brought by L. C.
Stuckey of Lancaster, one of the
largest stockraisers of the valley.
"I have lived in the'Anfelope Valley
for sixteen years," said Mr. Stuckey,
"but v have never seen such lamentable
conditions as the present ones. My own
herd has dwindled to about 500 head,
and some of them are so weak they can
scarcely walk. Other raisers are faring
no better, and unless we have good
rains, in a very short time or devise
some way to get the cattle out our
herds will be practically annihilated.
"Antelope Valley under the most fa
vorable conditions is none too good as
far as water is concerned, but this year
is. the worst in its history. The sage
brush and salt grass is completely
dried up, leaving practically no nour
ishment for the animals.

-will probably also be elected to suc

Overall s career as a college athlete
haa been interesting. He made his
ireshman football eleven, the varsity
eleven during his freshman vear and
then three subsequent elevens, having
been captain last year. He played
three years on the baseball nine and
this would have made his fourth. He
1* still eligible to play another year
Â«n the baseball nine and if he comes
back to the -university next year, as he
intends, he will figure again as an ath
lete.
â¢ BERKELEY. Jan. 25. â Orval Over
ail, captain of this year's baseball nine
and last year's football eleven, will
not be in college when the intercol
legiate baseball series is played. He
announced to-day that he had applied
for a leave of absence for one year
from the university and as soon as it
is granted he will leave, which will
be not later than Wednesday. The
loss of Overall will greatly cripple the
team, as he is its mainstay in pitch
ing and battiRg. His pitching last
year was what decided the intercol-
Jeglaie games, as the Stanford batters
were unable to touch any of his twist
ers. He made such a good showing
that offers from professional teams
Â¦were showered upon him. He turned
them all down.

Since 1890 four local banks have
closed their doors and banks in neigh
boring towns have been forced to sus
pend chiefly through losses sustained in
lnestments in the Western States. It is
estimated that within ten years citi
zens of Nashua have lost full/ $2,000,000
through the embarrassment cf banking
institutions.
Â«oggin was held in $10,000 bonds for
the Grand Jury. He made no state
ment, but It was said that his down
fall was not due to speculation, but to
his having given assistance from time
to time to a friend. Goggin is one of
the most prominent bank officials in
New Hampshire. He came here from
the West about ten years ago and in a
short time he was made treasurer of
the trust company. He is about 40
years of age and has a family.
An attachment of $50,000 was placed
on the property lield by Goggin in this
city by the banks to-day. Real estate
of George E. Gage of Manchester was
levied on to recover a promissory note
for $20,000. Another attachment for
$12,000 has been filed against real es
tate owners in this city by Gage. Gage
was formerly a bank official here.
The directors of the Nashua Trust
Company, have issued a statement as
suring depositors that they will lose
nothing.
Goggin has been removed from the
office of treasurer and Joseph L.
Clough has been appointed to fill the
vacancy temporarily.
-VASHUA, 2Z. H.. Jan. 23.â John R.
Goggin, treasurer of the Nashua Trust
Company, was arrested to-day charged
with emberzlingr from tho bank be
tween JSO.000 and 5100.000.
The Nashua Trust Company did not
open its doors to-day and the institu
tion is in charge of the State Bank
Commissioners pending: a further ex
amination.

The "Kid" repaired to Mike Shee
han's beach tavern as soon as he fin
ished shaking hands with a bunch of
new acquaintances. He will get into
the going to-day and promises to train
faithfully till the night of the battle.
He expresses himself as being anxious
to meet Young Corbett should he beat
Hanlon and when questioned regard
ing- that battle laughed and said,
"Well, there's nothing to it. â¢ I can
beat this kid, and when the Frisco
sports see me go they will agree with
my backers that I have a license to
Â£rrÂ» Tin ."iÂ«inct fnrhntf "
The only time that the "Kid" was
knocked out was In Montana a few
months ago, when he took a contract
to put Mexican Herrera to the land of
bliss in a few moments. But the
swarthy one double crossed the "Kid"
and, of course, it surprised every one
that knows the fighting game.
Nevertheless. Broad thinks that he
can beat Hanlon. He will go into
training at once and a few days 1 work
will fix him up for any kind of a fight.
He never trains more than a week
and, strange to say, Is always in good
trim when he steps into the roped
arena.
Broad is heralded as one of the
toughest fist artists before the public
10-day. For years he has been at the
jjame and he has always demonstrat
ed his willingness to take a beating
and at the same time fight back and
give his opponent a run for the hon
ors.
"Kid" Broad, the man that fights
every night in the week if it is nec
essary; made a quiet entry into San
Francisco yesterday morning. The
"Kid" was stopping in New Orleans
for a few weeks and watching 'em run
at the track, but as soon as he heard
that it was possible to go a few with
the gloves >ti this city he bought a
ticket, and now he's here.
Broad will b<? Eddie Hanlon's next
opponent if everything goes right. The
boys are matched to go twenty rounds
under the auspices of the San Fran
cisco Athletic Club next Friday even
ing at catch weights, though they will
both tip the scales at about 130
pounds when the clash begins.
Among the busers suspended are the
cream of the amateur talent in this
City, and perhaps in the country. Those
under the ban are Sam Berger and
<Jeorge Sullivan, heavy- weights; George
Murray and William Stewart, light
heavy-weights; Joe Thomas and George
Peterson, welter-weights; John Burke
and Robert Lundie, lightweights; Abe
Label and Al Elkins. feather-weights,
and Joseph Kelly and John Bowles,
bantam-weights.
The promoters of the Sequoia Athletic
Ciub of Oakland were also cited to ap
pear before the committee on the same
<harg:e. It is alleged that that club has
also been holding professional exhibi
tions with amateur licenses, and in all
probability their license will be taken
away, and the death blow to the "ama
teur" fighting game will be dealt on
both sides of the bav.
When the Lincoln Club pulled off its
mammoth "amateur" carnival the
members of the Pacific Amateur Asso
ciation . became suspicious that every
thing was not all right and began an
Investigation. They learned that many
of 'those that took part received money,
the principal offender being Sam Berger,
>vhq is allÂ«><jed to have been handed
JKiOO by the promoters of the club.
Then the association people pried still
further into the affair and discovered
many other things that made the ex
hibition look like a professional one to
them. When the committee, composed
of George James, Herbert Hauser and
Thomas Harris, met yesterday after
noon their minds were fully made up,
ana they immediately voted to blacklist
every boxer that took part in the Lin
coln Club's show, and also to cite the
members of the club to appear before
the committee next Friday night and
explain the matter thoroughly.
The amateur boxing game in this city
mas dealt a blow yesterday by the Pa
cific Amateur Association that will in
all probability eliminate that line of
eport hen? for good. After a deal of
consideration and thought the registra
tion committee of the association met
a.nd voiod to blacklist every so-called
â¢ainateur* boxer that took part in the
exhibition given by the Lincoln Club
last Tuesday right, and a!?o cited the
officials of the club to appear before
the committee r.ext Friday night and
ebon- cause v.hy they should not be ex
pelled from the amateur ranks.
Thip move on the part of the associa
tion is as sudden as it iÂ«= crushing, and
tvill come like a thunderbolt to the pro
moters of the alleged "amateur" fisli
ouJT-game now doin? business here.
For many moons the members of the
association have sought a chance ro
stop, the amateur boxing exhibitions,
claiming that they were professional in
Â«*very sense of the word, but the oppor
tunity did not arrive until last week.

Mike Sweeney, official caller at the
Chicago tracks, was an onlooker at
Oakland yesterday. Mike just crossed
the hills to see his friends and pick a
few winners.
The well-known Jockey Johnny Woods
died at Beaumont. Cal., Sunday even
ing, where he had gone in quest of
health, a -sufferer from dread tubercu
losis. The deceased rider was born in
Edinburgh, Scotland, twenty-one years
ago, and at different stages of his turf
career, which began in 1895. had piloted
horses from the stables of Mat Storn
Barney Schrelber, Burns & Water
house, John W. Schorr and Durnell &
Herz. Johnny was a determined fin
isher and when in form could hold his
own with the best riders on the West
ern tracks. Just before leaving for
Beaumont, some days ago, he told a
friend he was possessed of $15,000. but
that he would rather have $1 and his
health. The body will be brought to
Oakland for interment.

John Condon, owner of Harlem track,
Chicago, accompanied by Martin Na
thanson, will pay California a visit
next month.
Hildebrand was fined $50 by Starter
Dwyer for breaking through the bar
rier with His Eminence.
It has been discovered that Kentish
Shrew, raced here by Lamasney Bros,
as a two and three year old, is really a
four-year-old. The stewards have ex
onerated the flrpi owning the mare
from any intent of wrongdoing in the
matter, as they purchased her last June
in the East from John Madden as a
two-year-old and supposed her to be
such. ;
Some day when Mike Daly gets tired
of putting up Willie Daly on Lapidus
the little gelding will win a race.
Willie had previously tossed off two
races and in they mile and seventy
yard selling fixture yesterday made it
three straight. Getting almost left at
the post, Willie then took the gelding
the overland route, and, on pounds the
best horse, finished sixth. Oliphant,
astride Lady Kent, the 13 to 5 favorite,
rode a well judged race, scoring
cleverly at the finish from Searcher, a
12 to 1 shot. Norford was a well
backed horse, but Bell could accom
plish nothing with him. Some day he
may do better. J
Frank Reagan's luck appears to
have taken a change for the better.
His chestnut horse, Xamtor, . closed
qeual favorite with Telephone for the
mile and a sixteenth selling number,
and. enjoying a fresh breeze and clear
sailing from 1 the time of weighing
anchor, was returned on easy first,
with Wonderly in the saddle. Sammy
Greenfield, on Telephone, was badly
interfered with on the first turn, but
managed to finish second, less than a
length before His Eminence.
In the mile and seventy yard run
Frank Woods was back with all his
speed, defeating Optimo and Bill Mas
sie quite handily. The odds against
Woods reached 21 to 5 and were then
played down to 18 to 5. Larsen again
had the mount, and, never being far
out of it at any stage of the running,
the old gelding finished with his usual
supply of speed, disposing of the pace
maker, Optimo, by nearly -a length.
(Jawaine, the favorite, was fourth.
Chickadee ran a very poor race.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
She trailed Targette into the stretch,
and then in a drive beat the Fountain
entry out half a length. Harbor, a 15
to 1 outsider, downed Lustijr a head
for the show.
A very ordinary bunch of maidens
started in the two-year-old scramble,
with Eduardo, from the Burns &
Waterhouse stable, being enthroned
favorite At odds of 9 to 5. He was
bothered some in the stretch turn and
finished third. Bill Short, a 10 to 1
shot, led to the bend for home and
would have won had he not run out.
Speaker Fontana also "took to the
brush," carrying Sea Air out with him.
Jack Martin then skinned the rail
with Mogregor, getting a head decis
ion at the wire from Sea Air.
Of the four favorites that were
rocked to sleep at Oakland track yes
terday Haeerdon carried the heaviest
commission. The Frank entr.y went
to the post a 4 to 5 favorite for the
final seven furlong purse event, and
after looking: all over a winner was
beaten out by the Eastern mare Fu
turita, the second choice. The victory
was a justly deserved one, for Futurita
looked dead beaten on the stretch turn.
Hildebrand, who had the mount, did
not give up though, and catching the
faint-hearted favorite near the pad
dock, earned the verdict by nearly a
length. Soothsayer was a good third.
The fields in the different races were
not above mediocrity, although fur
nishing some very good sport. Business
in the ring: was lively and the usual
large Monday crowd -was present.
With Dell Fountain's Targrette a
favorite in the betting:, Flo Manola, a
50 to 1 shot, bobbed up as winner of
the opening sprint. The filly had not
been to the post before in some weeks
and was almost forgotten.

There was chaos in the residence cf
Augustus D. Splivalo, a well-known at
torney, at 1120 Washington street test
evening. A squad of deputy sheriffs
descended upon the place soon after
5 o'clock and in a short time all the
furniture and equipments of the base
ment and first floor were piled upon the
sidewalk. It was due to the charity of
the deputy in charge of the case that
the entire family was not driven out
of doors and forced to seek shelter else
where. They were permitted to remain
in their quarters on the second story
for the night under condition that they
should not attempt to cart any of the
property that had been taken out back
into the premises.
The trouble is one of long standing.
It appears that Mrs. Florenda Por
tener. a daughter of the attorney, bor
rowed $10,000 from the Hibernia Sav
ings and Loan Society In 1897. At that
time It was supposed that Mrs. Por
tener was the sole owner of the prem
ises and the banking company consid
ered the property as security. Litiga
tion followed and a portion of the
money was paid, but a balance still
remained. Then it was discovered that
Mrs. Splivalo. wife of the attorney,
claimed title to the security and ig
nored the debt of her daughter.
Judge Hebbard issued a writ of as
sistance after 4 o'clock yesterday af
ternoon. The Hibernia Bank people,
through their attorney, secured the
order and the papers were soon in the
possession of the Sheriffs officers.
Eight deputy sheriffs started for the
Washington street residence. The
writ commanded them to go and enter
upon the premises and to eject and re
move therefrom all and every person
holding or detaining the same. Au
gustus D. Splivalo nnct his wife. Cata
lina Splivalo, were particularly named
as occupants and their removal was
expected as well as that of the daugh
ter, Florencia Portener.-
The work of demolition was com
menced at once. Furniture was carted
out and placed upon the sidewalk and
carpets were torn from the floors.
Even the property contained in the
yard was removed. Deputy Sheriff
Jesse Galland, who has charge of such
matters, then arrived on the scene and
directed the work. Splivalo watched as
operations continued. He threatened
the Sheriff with an action for damages
and told those that were engaged in
dismantling the rooms that they
should be proud of desecrating: a habi
tation in which the nobility of many
lands had been entertained at one time
or another.
Splivalo finally became pathetic and
his daughters joined in an appeal that
they should not be turned into the
streets without sufficient notice. Gal
land relented in his determination to
strip the house and left the UDDer por
tion, which is occupied by the family,
untouched. But the work of demo
lition will be continued to-day. If the
attorney does not remove the personal
property which has been set upon the
pavement the Board of Public Work*
will be notified and he will be charged
for its storage.
"When the officers arrive this morning
to take possession of the second storr
of the house a lively time Is expected,
but they will be prepared to execute
the writ unless restrained by the
courts. It is the intention of Solivalo
to apply to Judge Hebbard for a re
straining order, but whether or not It
will be granted is yet a matter of con
jecture.

L.A CROSSE. Wis.. Jan. 25.â As a re
sult of momentary negligence on the
part of Mrs. Edward Schmidt, her 16
months-old baby Mathilda was placed
in an oven by Mary, a child of five
years, and burned to a crisp.
Mrs. Schmidt had heated the oven
preparatory to baking bread and it was
almost redhot. She left her three
little girls, including the baby, in the
kitchen while she chopped more fuel
in a woodshed about fifty feet from
the house. When she returned the
baby was missing, but her questions
to the other children brought no in
formation. After searching the house
she smelled the odor of cooking flesh,
and, rushing to the stove, Jerked open
the oven door. The child's body, baked
to a crJsp. was disclosed.
It appears that the five-year-old sis
ter, believing the infant was cold,
sought to warm it and, pushing it Into
the oven, closed the door and then for
got it.
When the mother opened the oven
door the draught caused the clothing
of the child to burst into flames and
charred its already blackened body un
til it was almost unrecognizable. Un
able to pull the flaming corpse from
the stove, the frantic mother ran
screaming for help, and when the body
was at last recovered little remained.

if he did not consent to the marriage

ened that they would tar and feather
him and would then ride him on a

It must be considered the fault of
Hall Caine if "The Eternal City" does
not absolutely please, for really Ed
ward Morgan and his company do all
in their power to make the ponderous
plot move along with some liveliness,;
Those who like Hall Caine's stories
may like his plays, but there is a rea
sonable doubt whether this latest pro
duction of the Manx author will whol
ly satisfy even them. If it does not.
the actors cannot be held in any way
accountable.
The mere piling up of one awful
catastrophe upon another does not
constitute a good drama. Neither
does it profit that the sacredness of
the relierious idea in the embodiment
of the Holy Father himself be invoked
to help out the plot. All this aside,
however, "The Eternal City" contains
one great scene and that almost re
deems? the drag and the halts in the
remainder of the play. This, the cli
max of the plot, gives Frederick de
Belleville. Miss Sarah Truax and Ed
ward Morgan a wonderful opportunity

The Alcazar company struggled last
night with Henry Arthur Jones' "The
Masqueraders" and came out even in
the encounter. The play is supposed to
represent the worst phases of English
society, and the characters are certain
ly broadly drawn. Adele Block does
excellent work as Dulcie Larondle.
James Durkin plays David Reraon
with his usual intelligence, and is espe
cially strong in the scene where he wins
at play the wife of Sir Brice Skene, a
villain's part, to which Luke Conness
does full justice. Harry S. Hilliard is
all that can be desired as Montague
Lushington, but if English society is as
bad as he paints it then all one can do
is to invoke the aid of Divine Provi
dence on the said society. Miss Adele
Belgarde plays Helen Larondie with
true womanly grace, but the author
should have presented more of her to
offset the many bad characters he in
troduces in the play. Frances Starr has
not much to do, but she does it well,
and the same can be said of Miss Marie
Howe. John D. Maher is good as Eddie
Remon, and George Osbourne does a,
fine bit of character as Jimmy Stokes.
The piece is well staged, and after
the players have thoroughly familiar
ized themselves with their lines will go
smoothly and be on a par with some
of the Alcazar's best successes.

known the only explorations . of the
cliff houses made to date vas by -a
party headed by L. S. Dickinson of
Salt Lake. There are probably at
least a dozen cliff dwellings in this vi
cinity and perhaps, saia Dickinson,
most of them are so high that it is im
possible to get to them by ordinary
means. They were able to reach only
three and had great difficulty in doing
that. They found dried corn, some
stones used in grinding it and a little
pottery such as is obtained from the
cliff dwellings in the San Juan country.
Professor Byron Cummings of the
University of Utah said this afternoon:
"I never before heard of the existence
of these cliff dwellings north of Price.
I am anxious to see them. I intend to
bring the matter to the attention of the
Archaeological Institute with a view
to having a thorough and scientific in
vestigation undertaken."

Calif ornians here generally regret the
contest, as they fear it will defer, if
not absolutely endanger, the location

Senator Bard has been. authorized to
favorably report from the Committee
on Public Lands the bill providing that
California shall receive j per cent of all
public lands sold within the State. The
I ill was favorably reported in the
House.
Senator Bard, from the Committee on
Public Lands, reported favt rably the
bill for the purchase of the Cc laveras
big trees.
The full report received by wire to
day says the main objection to" Santa
Marguerita ranch is the location of the
town of that name in the center of the
property.- As between the other two.
the sanitary conditions and water and
timber supplies are said to be superior
on the Henry ranch to those of Naci
miento.
The Henry ranch is in San Luis
Obispo County, twenty miles south of
Nacimiento. It is also a little nearer
the ocean and the altitude is higher.
Between it and the ocean there is a
range of mountains. The price asked
for the ranch is $500,000; the price for
Nacimiento is $360,000. Judge J. L.
Stevens of Boone, Iowa, is in the city
in the interest of the Henry ranch and
will appear before the committee,
which will meet to hear all parties on
Thursday.
This had not been done when the re
port was filed by Lieutenant Colonel of
Engineers W. H. Heuer and approved
by G. L. Gillespie, brigadier general
and chief engineer, recommending the
Nacimiento ranch. In conformity with
that report Senator Perkins introduced
a bill providing for an appropriation
for its purchase. The bill was referred
to the Military Committee, where it
has met strong opposition on the part
of friends of the Henry ranch. They se
cured the appointment of a commission
to make the inspection as advised in
the original report, and this was begun
within the past few weeks.

But there are several oiher praise
worthy performers in the large com
pany. W. H. Clarke ventilated a bass
voice that forced encores and Edward
Clarke sang with a high, fresh bary
tone, acted artistically and looked
handsome. Charles Prince had a part
that admits of more laughter compel
ling than he invested in it, Edmund
Lawrence made the role of a Celestial
chancellor yield all that it contained,
and John K. Henshaw has augmented
his British-built character with deft
'"business" and interpolated lines until
it conveys amusement to American au
ditors. The feminine contingent ia
weak voqally and strong numerically
and in good looks.
It is a well-dressed show. The scenes
are laid in China and the stage furnisn
ing and costumery are extravagantly
Oriental. In the story there is nothing
to demand attention and the music is
of the rattlety-bang sort, in which
drums and cymbals and gongs are dom
inantâa Chinatown festival din in
measured beatsâ that made it almost
as acceptable to the cultured ear . as
either rag-time proper or rag-time In
dian. The ensembles were noisy enough
i<> satisfy the most exorbitant stickler
for that sort of thing-, the finale of the
flrFt act being a very effective bit of
thunderous harmony.
"A Chinese Honeymoon" is on for two
weeks, and Miss Toby Claude is suf
ficient of her tiny self to make it at
tractive.
Never did the Columbia Theater har
bor a bigger or noisier show than "A
Chinese Honeymoon," and never was a
more gigantic hit made in any theater
by a more diminutive comedienne than
Miss Toby Claude, who played the part
of a transplanted Cockney waitress.
A daintier, more perfectly proportioned
Â¦4>H of femininity has seldom been seen
on any stage in San Francisco, and the
folk whom she kept screaming with
laughter last night are ready to as
severate that they never saw one pos
sessed of more genuin; funmakiug
talent. Her make-up amd dialect were
inimitably ludicrous, and her acting
was too comical to permit of accurate
description in cold type. From the mo
ment of her first entrance till the final
curtain shut out her ridiculous figure
from the convulsed people- in front sho
had their rislblea at command.
that end of the fourth act something
to remember. It is powerful.
Mr. Morgan does not have the op
portunity which "The Christian" gave
him. In the last act he does not have
the chance to appear until almost
time for the final curtain bell. The
play seems to be constructed almost
solely for the heroine, but when Mor
gan does have the stage his old tense
style seems to fit the part of the young
radical member of the Deputies per
fectly. Frederick de Belleville has
equal honors with Morgan; his study
of the crafty minister is one of the
best of his many roles. Difficult as the
part of the Holy Father may be, with
its attitude of exalted piety and saint
ly reserve. Prank C. Bangs carries it
in a manner which sustains the exalt
ed spirit necessary.
Miss Truax, who carries the hero
ine's part, has many temptations to
overdo in several of the scenes, but in
the main keeps within limits. Her
emotional scene with De Belleville is
remarkable.

I could close my e3 f cs again. I dreaded,

but, finding that their medicines did

it was highly recommended to me. I am
glad that I did so, for I soon found
that it was the medicine for my case.
Very soon I was rid of every ache and

I feel splendid, have a fine appetite,
and have gained in weight a lot." â

The Standard Oil Company's ship Astral,
Captain Dunham, now discharging coal at the
Ueale-street bunkers, is one of the few ships
afloat that Is pratically fireproof. She i* a
steel vessel of unusually handsome proportions,
and In pplte of her dirty cargo, one of the
cleanest vessels Sn port. So far asconstruc
tlun goes she In virtually a. twin sister to the
William P. Frye and both vessels - represent
the modern American steel clipper at Its best.
Jn the matter of handling fire, however, the
Astral is In a class by herielf and Is at pres
ent an object of great Interest to the local
marine insurance world. The fire-fighting ap
paratus Is simple and raid to be most effective.
From a machlno located under the forecastle
head Dices are laid to every part '.of -the ship.-
By the means ,i>f thess pipes and with the Bid
of an air pump the temptrature of any of the
holds can be tested. If the cargo Is found to
have become heated the pipe from tlie hot hold
1# connected with a pipe colled in a stream of
cold water. The hot air Is is pumped from the
l-.old, cooled In the coll and returned. If more
desirable, fresh air from the' deck can be sub
stitvted. In the event of fire actually breaking:
out the pipes are connected with an oven in
which sulphur fumes are. Renerated. The air
pump takei charge of the fumes and within a
few minutes the hold or cabin In which the
fire is located is filled with the chemical va
por and the blaze dies. The sulphur-ladÂ«n air
la then drawn off. fresh' air substituted and an
examination may be made of the scene of the
conflagration. This apparatus can also be used
for dlslnfectln- and ia .frequently employed to
rid the shlo of nuch vermin as accumulate In

The China Commercial Company'* eteamshlp
Atholl. CaDtain Watt, arrived yesterday from
the Orient and Manranilio. She carried from
llongl-.ong to the Mexican port 1T6 Chinese and
brought here five Chinese and twelve Japan
ese. The five Chinese Joined the Atholl at
Manzanillo and are goinc to Hongkong. The
Atholl also brought 1650 tons of freight. A
Chinese sailor died during the voyase across
the Psciflc. Caotaln Watt, the AtholPa com
mander, was last here in lt.69, when he visited
this uort as skipper of a sailing vessel. He
has been running between the Orient and Port
land for a number or years. *
Steamship Atholl Arrives.
The fast Vallejo nassenger steamer General
Frisbie yesterday found her match, ana the
II. J. Corcoran, recently converted into an
oil burner but not yet in proper running con
dition, is the boat that Â«et the new pace and
led the Frisbie from the navy yard town to
Mission-street wharf in one of the moat ex
citing- races seÂ«n on the bay Jn many days.
The Corcoran was recently Durchaped by the
Plper-Aden-Goodall Company to help out the
Sunol en the Vallejo run in opposition to the
General Frisbie. She was fitted with oil burn
ers and It was to try out the new fuel that
yesterday's trip was made. The Corcoran
after the race was returned to Vallejo, whe,re
her cabin conÂ«tnictlon will be remodeled and
the boat generally put into condition for the
service in which her new owners will place
her. The General Frisbie Is alro an oil bur
ner and until yesterday Iield the speed record
for boats of her clatn. AlthouKh beatr.n, the
Frisbie was not disgraced, for it was by little
more than a length that the Corcoran won.
That boat's lenrth of water separated the
boats at Red Rock and not all the oil that
either burned either lessened or lengthened
the gao. Leavlne Vallejo at 7 - o'clock, the
boats tore past the ferry depot at 8:40. They
were steaming aealnst a strong tide, but in
Eplte of thin handlcan developed a sDeed of
about IS miles an hour and knocked 20 min
utes off the best previous run under nlmilar
tide conditions. Captain Hatch, the Frtsble's
owner, directed affairs on his boat. Al Prior
was the Corcoran's mascot and Captain Henry.
Potvlne her pilot.
The Japanese liner America Maru
sailed yesterday for Japan, where she
will be taken into the service of the
Government as cruiser, transport, dis
patch boat or in whatever capacity the
naval authorities may think she will
serve best. She carried twenty-three
passengers, but those for Chinese ports
will be forwarded from Yokohama by
some other line, as at the Japanese
port the Toyo Kisen ICaisha will relin
quish control over their steamship.
The America carried only about 400
tons of cargo, which included a ship
ment of rifles and ammunition. By
way of stiffening she carried 600 tons
of coal and left port in fairly good
trim. There were few people on the
â¢wharf to witness the liner's departure.
This is the last of the Japanese liners
that will be seen in port untir matters
in the Far East are adjusted. No boats
running between here and the Orient
have been more popular with the trav
eling public and taking them off the
run leaves. a gap which will be hard to
fill. Under the management of W. H.
Avery the Toyo Kishen Kaisha steam
ers have offered peculiar inducements
in the way of comfort, service and
speed, and it is with regret that ship
pers of merchandise and travelers for
pleasure and business see these three
big yachtlike liners withdrawn, pos
sibly to make target for Russian bat
teries. They have all made good rec
ords in the paths of peace and every
body that has ever traveled on any of
them will take a personal pride irt any
glory they might win in naval war.
The America Will go by way of Mid
way Island, where Captain Going will
learn whether or not war has been de
clared. Her passengers included the
following named: /

STOCK MARKET.
CHICAGO, Jan. 25.â Extremely cold weather |
gave rise to apprehension among wheat traders i
that damage to the growing plant was prob- !
able. As a result of these fears there was an j
urgent demand from shorts at the opening, j
May was ?i@K >c to lÂ®14c higher at 91%@
924c. Little wheat was offered at the etart !
and the price rose to 92%c. But at this fig- i
ure the wheat began to come out. The sell- j
ing was Increased by later Liverpool cables,
which showed some weakness, and also by tha
large world's shipments. The climax . was
reached on heavy selling by brokers wh6 .were
said to bÂ«' acting for the Armour interests.
In consequence of this charge of front of the
present leading holder the market started to !
break. On the down-turn a great many stop- j
loss orders came Into the pit and hastened the i
decline. Enormous quantities were thrown j
upon the market, the big long alone being
credited with disposing of anywhere from one
and a half to seven million bus>hels. .When ;
the pressure to sell had subsided May was 1
down to 89c, a drop of 3%c from the high
point. Shorts became active buyers on the
decline and the demand from this source ail- i
vanced the price one cent. More wheat came (
out. however, on the bulge, and another re- }
action followed. The close was weak, with 1
May 2 rents under Saturday's close at SJ>%Â® â¢
KÂ»4c. The July delivery was relatively firmer.
After opening %@4c to 1VÂ«@1V4c higher at
82^. to M*,e. the price advanced to S3*4c but
then declined to 81 4c, a losg of 2%c. The
close was %c lower at SlVS681%c
In the face of the big break In wheat the
corn market showed surprising strength. May
opened i*<S?i;c higher at 49^c to 40%c, gold
up to .VJHc and after reacting to 4S%c closed
at 494c.
m There was a good demand for oats through
out the entire session, offerings being well
taken, until near the close, when selling he
came too liberal fcr the demand. May
opened 4c higher at 42>ic. advanced to 42>'*c
and after declining to 41 R Ac closed at 4134c!"
The feature In provision trade was liberal
purchases of lard by an outside concern. As
a result of thic demand prices showed good
gains. There waf considerable realizing on the
advance, but the close was 6trong with May
Pork up 15c; lard was 15Â«J174c higher and
ribs were 74c higher.

A firm feeling still prevails in the Apple
market, although trading is less active and
receipts are commencing to show a slight in
crease. Strictly tancy and trashy stock are
pretty well cleaned up. but supplies or medium
priced stcck are, ample, though not heavy.
Fine Newtown Pippins, packed in 34-tler
boxes, are very scarce and readily command
full figures. A carload of the Ben Davis va
riety arrived from Medford. Or., and met with
a fair Inquiry at $1 ir>'Â«yl 25 per box. Another
car is exutcted from the same source to-day.
Supplies of Winter Nellls Pears in coldstoraKe
are liberal. but ! they_ have to be carefully re
packed, which, with the cost of storage, neces
sitates the asking of high prices in the mar
ket. The demand at best is fair and the daily
withdrawals from storage are light. â¢ Â¦
Notwithstanding the warmer weather, which
*t-*med to encourage some - dealers, trade in
Oranges and other 'Citrus fruits in the open
market was very quiet. In the auction rooms
there was some demand for large size Navels
for shipment to Honolulu, which accounts for
the wide range in prices. Ten cars. Including
two of fancy Redlands fruit, were *old as fol
lows: Extra fancy, $1 30@2 30; ordinary fancy,
$1 1BQ1 80; choice. 90cij$l 00; standards. 4l>cÂ«

23 boxes of Otis brought (2 30 and 63 boxes

The situation in Eggs remains as at the close

The Poultry market was liberally supplied
and had an easy tone, as most retailers were
still well stocked with Western fowl purchased,
laÂ«t week.' Two and one-half cars of Western,
Including one "and one-half cars carried over
from Saturday, were on sale. The ruling price
for Western Hens and Roosters was $6 50 per
dozen, against $7 at this time last week. As
Is usually the case on Monday there was no
market for domestic stock and prices were
unchanged and largely nominal. No dressed
Turkeys- came in.'
Game was weak under literal arrivals and a
sluggish demand, and several descriptions were
lower; , â¢

After chatting for some time Miller
suggested that a glass of beer would
ne in order, anrt he left, returning in a
few minutes with a bottle of beer. She
drank a glass of the beer and almost
immediately became unconscious. When
she recovered she discovered that Mil
ler and his friend had gone and her
earrings, a .marquise ring-, three soli
taire diamond rings, a pair of gold
bracelets and a gold watch, had been
stolen from her, besides two $100 bills
her purse had contained. Such force
had been used to pull the rings off her
fingers that the skin was torn. She
valued the jewelry at about $200.
The police were tiotified and Miller
was arrested in San Jose on Sunday
night while trying to dispose of the
stolen jewelry. He told the police there
that he was clerk in Police Judge Mo
gan's court and had taken a flying trip
with a young lady. Their available
cash had become exhausted and he was
trying to sell some of her jewelry to re
plenish their purses. His story was not
believed and Miller was locked up and
a message sent to Chief Wittman. He
will be brought here. The police are
searching for Harris.

"Race Relations" was the subject of J
an elaborate paper read before the i
Presbyterian Ministers' Association at
the Home of the Occidental Board, Sac
ramento street, yesterday by the Rev.
George G. Eldredge of St. John's Pres- j
byterian Church, who said in part: :
"Race relations is the great ques- |
tion of the day and it will be the ab
sorbing question to-morrow. Prejudice j
has no place in the equipment of the \
man who would deal successfully yith j
this great problem. To push this prob
lem to one side is impossible. It is
upon us, and some solution must be
discovered and adopted in the compar
atively near future.
"In his pathetic though disappoint
ing book entitled 'The Sauls of Black
Folk,' the author states a profound
truth when he says: 'The problem of the
twentieth century is the problem of the
color line.' But the problem includes
much more than difference of color. It
is the problem of race gelations. It is
already with us and it will possess our
thoughts until solved. It Is too late
in the world's history for the writing
of an apology for slavery, and yet I
believe it is.the sober truth to say that
slavery has given place to something
worse.
"Where before there was watchful
interest of the white man over the
black man. now there is an unmerciful
grinding of the black: where before
there was love and loyalty now there
is only suspicion and hatred. I do not
want to be misunderstood and be
judged as an apologist for slavery,
for I am not. It is extremely doubtful
if any race ever came to civilization
except through slavery.
"Upon the church, as the most ag
gressive Christian force, as the instru
ment which God seems to be using
most to make men better, will fall the
brunt of the work of. bringing about
the equality of character."
Rev. Moses Bercowitz, president of
the association, was in the chair and
there was an exceptionally large gath
ering of ministers.
TO HOLD MEMORIAL SERVICE.
The Congregationalist ministers held
their weekly meeting yesterday at the
headquarters in the Y. M. C. A. build
ing. Rev. William Rader in the chair.
An Interesting paper was read by Rev.
I. C. Meserve. D.D., of Plymouth Con
gregational Church, this city, entitled
"For the Sake of Demas."
In the paper was mentioned the ma
terialistic tendencies of -the day and
the need of the church to emphasize
the spiritual life.
Next Monday a memorial service will
be held in the Congregational head
quarters relating to the late Dr. George
Mooar, professor in the Theological
Seminary. Berkeley.
THE COLOR PROBLEM.
The Rev. Mark Guy Pearse, in speak
ing before the Methodist ministers at
Epworth League Hall yesterday morn
ing, said there was a retarding of re
ligious influence through a too great
conservatism, by officialism and "stick
in-the-muds" who live by traditions.
He said that Christ has said, "Behold,
I make all things new." In mission
work they cqnstantly find new depar
tures. No church, said the Rev. Mr.
Pearse, can live unless it is occupied
with aggressive work. He could not
see how he was able to save his own
soul when. there is such a hell at his
door as the slums and severe poverty
unless he did something to alleviate
such conditions.
The Methodist Episcopal pastors of
the city and vicinity, the conference
board, the Deaconesses' Home trustees
and the board of deaconesses appointed
a committee consisting of Mrs. J. R.
Sims. Mrs. J. Soper, Mrs. Robert Mc-
Clellan, William Abbott, Rolla V. Watt,
Dr. F. D. Bovard and the Rev. John
Stephens to select a superintendent for
the Deaconesses' Home to fill vacancy
created by the death of Dr.- J. N. Beard.
The committee met yesterday afternoon
and appointed Dr. E. P. Dennett to the
position. Dr. Dennett is the son of the
Rev. Wesley Dennett and was educated
in this State, having studied at the
University of the Pacific.
; Dr. Dennett made the request to be
allowed until Wednesday to consider
the proposed honor and the responsi
bilities which go with the position. -
STICK-IN-THE-MUDS.
An effort to abolish Sunday funerals
has been under consideration by the
Methodist ministers for some time, and
its committee, composed of Dr. F/ M.
X,arkin and the Rev. John Stephens,
presented a set of resolutions at the
ministers' meeting yesterday.
It was recommended that the mem
bers of the various pastors' associa
tions c-f the city and the undertakers'
organizations, Hackmen's Union, the
cemetery associations, the organized
grave diggers and all unions that might
be affected by the movement in rela
tion to the abolishment of Sunday fu
nerals be communicated with.
Dr. Larkin, in speaking to the sub
ject, said he considered Sunday fu
nerals exceedingly trying to ministers
who had also to perform their Sunday
services. He also considered it as a
wrong use of the Lord's day. He
thought that every man should be priv
ileged to have one day's rest in seven,
even though he did spend that day at
the park or the Chutes, though as a
Christian he himself considered the
Sabbath should be g^ven up to the ser
vices of the church.
The resolution presented by the com
mittee to confer with various organ
izations was unanimously adopted.
The attorney for Alice Jane Smith %
the defendant in a suit for divorce
brought by John Madison Smith, a
prominent druggist of Durham, Butte
County, has filed a notice that on Feb
ruary 13 he will ask the court to com
pel Smith to pay his wife $35 a month
alimony pending the determination of
the suit. In an affidavit filed by Mr*.
Smith she avers that she is compelled
to support herself by working as a
seamstress and that unless her hus
band is eomoelled to provide for her
she will not have funds enough to de
fray the cost of defending the divorce
action.
Ruth B. Aronsohn, wife of Martin
Aronsohr., the mute Notary Public, was
granted a divorce yesterday by Judge
Hebbard and awarded 54000 as her share
of the property accumulated by htr
and her husband. The decree was
given on the ground of cruelty, Mrs.
Aronsohn . testifying that her husband
freauefltly beat her and tnat she suf
fered great humiliation because he was
fo stingy he would not give her car
fare. She says she also 'suffered men
tally because Aronsohn would wrong
fully accuse her of receiving the at
tentions of other men and then boast of
his intrigues with women of his ac
quaintance.
Judge Hebbard also granted a di
vorce to Marie Horn from Benjamin
C. Horn. Horn deserted his wife three
years ago. They were married at Mar
tinez in April, 1S95.
Suits for divorce for desertion were
filed by Austin Hutchinson against
Nellie Hutchinson. M. Stein against
Georgia Stein, Joseph A. Appleton
against Helen M. Appleton and Wil
liam Allen against Mary J. Allen.
An affidavit in support of a petition
for ap order citing B. C. Dalton to
appear in court to show cause why he

has been filed by Nina L. Dalton. his
divorced wife. Last December he was

and he has not done bo.
Dr. E. P. Dennett Is Chosen to
Fill the Position Made Vacant
by the Death of Dr. J. Beard
A splendid double quartet gave a
few rousing songs and then dancing â
the joy of the youthful â and of the
very aged â was the order of the hour.
At midnight the dance was on furi
ously.
Among the women noted -were Mrs.
Peter D. Martin, stunning in a brown
corduroy coat with sable collar: Mrs.
Eleanor Martin, in black velvet with
white coat with ermine collarette;
Miss Jennie Blair, in black glitter
gown; Mrs.. George Newhall, Mrs.
Chesebrough, Mrs. Frank Donnelly.
Mrs. Frank Deering, Mrs. Will Tay
lor. Mrs. Gub Taylor, Mrs. Latham
McMullen, Mrs. Boalt. Miss Florence
Bailey and Miss Elsie Tallant.
Jack Noyes followed at the piano,
and gave some awfulljt clever topical
songs. He sang four bofore the boule
vardiers would permit him to pass on.
Mrs. Youngberg and Miss Wheeler
both rendered some chic selections â a la
Anna Heldâ and then "Maggie was
called to the telephone."
Now, "Maggie" was Watson, the
monologist, and he covered himself
with glory. His "uh?" quite threw the
house into hysterics.
Then came the event of the evening,
when Mrs. Mark Gerstle, Miss Ethel
Hager, Miss Lucie King and Miss
Pearl Landers, stunningly gowned,
"sashayed" into the maple room, sing
ing 0s they advanced toward a vacant
table. In the marble room, from the
opposite side, came Roy Pike, Burbank
Somers, Powell Hutchings and clever
Billy Smith, who evidently were deeply
enamored of the four ladies. Well, thej*!
did the right thingâ came right in and
declared their love, lyrically, of course,
and the affair was over â as to the pre-'
arranged programme.
Such a captivating smile! Such
shoulders, such a snowy bosom, and
what a dulcet voice, as she looked lov
ingly into the men's eyes and pleaded
that they buy a c^gar. Who was the
sinuous Seville maiden that the men
raved over? Well, an hour later she
wore, with eternal fitness, a snug Tux
edo. It was pretty little Guido Georgi,
who acted his part like a major. A!as!
for the evanescence of human hopes!
Scattered througTi the fleeting hours,
with not a minute of dullness, came
the song of Alexander Rosborough. He
really makes a very clever coon, and
his stunt was a hit. Then Shatter How
ard, in an impious parody of the honor
able impresario, Marcus Mayer, gave a
very clever song, which was received
with bursts of applause. And he de
served it.
who is possessed of a rather unusual
amount of personality in her work.
But in the midst of this feast of song
who should interject himself but the
Copâ bearing a strong resemblance to
Captain John Martin of the detective
force, but a renegade member of the
Cop's pals revealed his identity. He
proved to be none other than Lester
Haskins. And then came his other
comradesâ Kolb, Dill, Ui#le Sam, and
oh, such a coy maiden, a la Carmen,
selling cigars and other smokables.
Here's to another Cafe Chantant!
But perhaps another would not make
good as did the affair at the Palace last
night. Unlike most "surprises," it
really surprised.
While it was true that tables were
being bid for rather lively for some
days past â even weeksâ who was there
that 'ooked for the crush of last night?
By 9 there wasn't a table to be had
in the maple room â and one didn't feel
quite safe in offering a tip to the
waiter to disr for one â so the overflow
went to the marble room. By 10 there
wasn't a table, nor yet a chair, iii the
marble room. And still the stream
grew.
Meanwhile the orchestra of the
Twentieth Century Musical Club had
tuned up and was soon dispensing
some music that was really good to
hear. Benjamin Lathrop led in splen
did style and the following 1 numbers
were rendered between the clever
stunts that were sprung as a surprise:
"Sammy" (Hutchinson); "MonAmour"
(Vanderpool); "Prince' of Pilsen"
(Luders); The Minstrels (Witmark);
"Cat's Parade" (Johnson); "Honey.
My Sweet" (Spink); "The Storks"
(Chapin); "Valse Bleu" (Mar&is);
"Dolly Gray."
â¢ At 10:20 the story began to unfold as
to the vaudeville held in reserve. Much
liquid refreshment had by this time
been served by the handsome srarcons.
in a manner highly creditable to the
most exclusive of waiters' unions. The
following chaps balanced the traysâ
and let it be known from the housetops
that no guest had a bath therefrom:
Lloyd Baldwin. "Wilbur Burnett. Gerald
Rathbone. Will Page, Athole McBean,
Mr. Petherick, Worthington Ames,
Willard Drown, Seward McNear. Sid

and the typical California corkscrew
chained to his broad shoulders. Wil
