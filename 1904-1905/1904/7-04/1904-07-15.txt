CALL'S ST. PETERSBURG CORRESPONDENT SAYS REPORT
OF JAPANESE DISASTER AT PORT ARTHUR IS NOT TRUE
T^HE CALL'S St. Petersburg correspondent, whose sources of information are of the highest, asserts that the report that 30,000
Japanese were killed by mines during an attack upon Port Arthur is utterly without foundation, and that official St. Petersburg
knows now that the report- was circulated by the Japanese themselves, with the hope of enticing Kuropatkin to advance upon
his supposedly crippled foe. On the contrary, the St. Petersburg bureau of the Associated Press reaffirms the report, and as
serts that confirmatory telegrams have been received from private sources in the Far East. In view of these conflicting state
ments, it is to be noted that some days have now elapsed since the reported disaster without official confirmation from Port
Arthur; also that the Japanese, far from being demoralized, have occupied Yinkow without encountering opposition..

happy frame of mind. The ab
sence of a dispatch from 'Lieutenant
General Stoessel, commander of the
military at Port Arthur, regarding the
reported disaster to the Japanese on
Sunday night is generally attributed to
the delay in communicating official
news, owing to the absence of the Em
peror.
Private dispatches received at. St.
Petersburg from Russian sources in the
Far East confirm the reports from
Mukden and Chef u. According to a
usually reliable source the Japanese
losses were 28,000 and the Russian
losses 1S00.
The, city remains in a. ferment. of ex
citement and the . extras ' are . eagerly,
bought in the hope of finding the long
expected dispatch from .General Stoes
sel.' was only late last night that a
dispatch arrived, which, had it become
generally known, would have tended
somewhat to . dampen the enthusiasm.
This was a. dispatch from Tatchekiao,
communicating an undated j dispatch
from Port Arthur received on July 13.
It did not mention the. assault or the
repulse, but it is quite possible that the
dispatch was sent from Port Arthur
earlier than July 10, so that it" cannot
be . fairly regarded as " contradictory
evidence. â¢-â¢
It is quite certain up to this date
that 1 there is no disposition in Stl Pe

news. _ There is a. general conviction

ST. PETERSBURG, July 14. â Wh"en
the official Gazette yesterday afternoon
published a special edition stating that
Viceroy Alexieff had Informed the staff
here that S0.000 Japanese had fallen
in an attack upon Port Arthur, people
who dismissed such news as being false
when announced from irresponsible
sources finally believed it. Great was
the feeling of pleasure that at last a
victory for Russian arms could be an
nounced.
It appears now, though, that, the
whole thing was a miserable hoax on
the part of the Japanese, in order to
mislead General Kuropatkin and cause
him to advance. The consequent mortl
cation and disgust felt to-day had no
limits.
To make matters .worse, according to
the latest dispatches General \ Oku : is
seriously threatening Newchwang with
a large force, . "while Japanese Field
Marshal Oyama has taken the direction
of the investing forces at Port Arthur
and the best ship in the. Russian navy
in the Far Ea.st. the Movlk, has been

NEW YORK. July U.â Charles "W. H,
Carter of No. 148 Lincoln road, Brook
lyn, died last night in a cab while be
ing driven from Prospect Park to the
St. George Hotel. He was 70 years old
and rated as a millionaire. A mys
terious veiled woman, who was with
him, has disappeared, and although
foul play is not suspected, detectives
are searching for her. .
Carter met a young . woman last
night In front of Brooklyn Borough
Hall. After a few minutes' conver
sation he engaged James McGulre, a
cabman, to drive them through the
park. McGuire was half way through
the park when he heard sharp raps
on the cab window and a shrill, fright
ened â¢ voice of a woman. * He stopped
his horse and Inquired what had hap
pened. : ,V;;. -j\ . ;.-;
"For God's . sake, come down," she
said^ ."this -old gentleman has fainted
and I fear that he Is dying."
Carter had. fallen from his seat and
was unconscious. McGulre suggested
that: they drive back for a physician,
but the woman begged to be permitted
to leave them. When McGuire re
fused she begged that . they, be driven
back to St. George Hotel. She begged
to be. allowed to go first Into the hotel
to warn the â¢ man's family. McGulre
let her go 'and she has not been seen
since. At the hotel Dr. Henry was
called and said that death had prob
ably been instantaneous. No one was at
Carter's late to-night.

DOUBTFUL WORDING OF REPORT

wording. It is contrary to the custom
of the War Office tp publish statements
made with such reserve as Viceroy,

Under yesterday's date, .the -corre

"There is nothing in the report that

that Jewish bankers did not participate

RUSSIAN POPULACE WILDLY REJOICING OVER DOUBTFUL REPORTS
OF GREAT SLAUGHTER OF JAPANESE IN PORT ARTHUR BATTLE
BT. PETERSBURG, July 14.â A tele
gram from Lieutenant General Sakha
roff, reviewing the situation yesterday,
notes the continued Japanese advance
on Tatchekiao and continuous fighting
along the Siuyen roads converging on
Tangchi, ten miles southeast of Tatch
kiao. The Russian outposts apparently
were not offering -serious resistance on
either side of the Siuyen roads or along
the line of General Oku's advance.
There may be a slight collision at
Tangchi, where General Kuropatkin
probably has stationed his left wing
rear guard. The Japanese are utilizing
Kaichou to land supplies.
General Sakharoff also reports the
appearance of General Kuroki's out
posts considerably south of
This is an indication of a general flank
ing movement on Haicheng.
The Japanese northern outposts are
falling back on Sal mat za, probably due
to pressure on the part of General Ren

Two companies that remained at
Kaichou had to fight their way north
with bayonets.
The Chinese at Kaichou gave the
Japanese an enthusiastic reception,
decorating the streets and houses.
The Japanese began to press the rear
guard after the majority of the Rus-
Eian troops had gone north and Colonel
Krauz, with a battery, came to the
rescue. He posted his guns near the
gateway and fired 500 rounds with ter
rific effect upon the advancing Jap
anese. The Japanese gunners at first
fired wildly, but finally found the
range, a well-aimed shell killing Count
Neirod, who was standing beside
Colonel Krauz. The Russian guns
were then removed.
There was a critical moment when
the bulky commissariat wagons had to
pass the exposed narrow gateway. The
Japanese tried to take advantage of
the situation and repeatedly attacked
the Russian flank, but they were beat
en off.
BT. PETERSBURG. July 15.â People
who had begun to grumble at Genral
Kuropatkin are Inclined novr to take
the opposite view, which is voiced by
a trained military expert, who says the
retreat from Kaichou was a master
piece in tactics. This expert sees in
Kuropatkln's strategy the flawless car
rying out of military science, a depart
ure from which would have precipi
tated disaster. In this light General
Etakelberg's march appears to have
been a stroke of genius, since he kept

L'aotung peninsula.
The transfer of General Kuropatkin's
etaff to Tatchekiao and the appearance
of great activity there "bluffed" the
Japanese Into devoting all their atten
tion to that Quarter, leaving the more
valuable line from Liaoyang to Muk
den alone.
Even if there be no battle at Tatche
kiao or Haicheng, the Russians are
now looking forward with entire con
fidence to the concentration of General
Kuropatkln's force around Liaoyang,
which will mark the successful term

paign.
TATCHEKIAO. Monday, July 11.â
The Russian retreat from Kaichou with
the loss of only 100 men and the in
fliction of .heavy losses on the Japanese*
was a brilliant feat, of which General
Kuropatkin marked his appreciation
by conferring decorations on every of
ficer present.

carried out in the face of tremendous

General Stakelberg, directing the op

KANSAS CITY, July 14.â Four of the

its efforts to-morrow. The different
plants each hired some new men and
they assert that many more will be
employed to-mcrrow. On the other
hand, 200 boxmakers, coopers and la
borers went out to-day, and the union
officers say that 1090 men have joined
the strikers In the past forty-eight
hours. Louis Timmerman, president of
the Pork Butchers' Union in Kansas
City, said to-day:
"We initiated 300 men yesterday and
to-day, from the Fowler and Armour
plants alone, into our unions. We are
taking in all the unskilled laborers
who will consent to join the strike."
There was no show of violence to
day. The supply of meat on hand has
materially decreased since the strike
began.
"There is not enough meat in town to
make it worth while to advance prices
further," said C. W. Armour of the Ar

The proposition made by M. J.
Donnelly for the strikers, which led to
the conference to-day, contained the
following demands:
"That all employes who struck shall
be employed in their old positions
within three days; that the packers
pay the wages prevailing before the
strike, pending arbitration; that the
arbitration committee be composed of
one member of the packers, one mem
ber of the strikers, the two to select a
third (the three arbitrators to be prac
â¢"ical packing-house men); that the
award In wages to be made by the arbi
trators shall take effect from the time
of resumption of work, but that the
award shall not involve any reduction
in wages."
The representatives of the packers
replied to Donnelly as follows: '
"In reply to your note and explan
ation of what you are willing to arbi
trate, we cannot acquiesce in same. We
are willing to arbitrate the whole mat
ter, covering wages and working con
ditions of aJI employes out on strike,
you having the privilege of bringing
before the arbitrators for decision any
question of wages or conditions or other
grievances you may think you have;
we to have like privilege, and both to
abide by the decision of the arbitrators.
We will retain all now at work and will
re-employ all the men now out as fast
as possible, giving preference In the
order of application, at the wages re
ceived when going on strike, pending
the decision of the arbitrators."
The note was signed by Armour &
Co., Swift & Co., Nelson Morris & Co.,
Schwarzchlld & Sulzberger, the Na
tional Packing Company, the Cudahy
Packing Company and LIbby, McNeill
& Libby.
DONNELLY'S PROPOSITION.
In the preliminaries of the peace
movement Donnelly acted for the
Ftrikers and J. Ogden Armour for the
packers. Samuel Gompers, whose ad
vice Donnelly sought, urged the local
leader to accept arbitration on any fair
terms.
The hitch in the negotiations is over
the reinstatement of the strikers. The
union demands that every one who
went on strike shall be given his old
place before an agreement to arbitrate
will be considered. The packers de
clare that they will retain the men
they have employed since the strike
and will take back the old men in the
order in which they apply for their old
positions.
After a conference, which lasted all
of the afternoon between representa
tives of the packers and members of
the unions the employers to-night are
waiting for an answer to a counter
proposition, which they this afternoon
submitted to M. J. Donnelly in reply
to a statement of the terms upon
v.'hich he would be willing to make a
settlement. Donnelly said to-night
that the counter proposition of the
packers would be rejected and that he
â¢would in turn present a counter propo
sition to-morrow.

While some slaughtering was being

little livestock was bought by packers

at the four plants, mostly unskilled la
borers and office men. All of the man
agers, however, said that new men
would be given employment when ap

Other fights took place during the

nobody was seriously hurt.
The temper of the crowd was ugly

"The . anti-trust plank is a good one.
It demands the enforcement of the
criminal clause of the criminal law

once convicted.
"The plank is infinitely superior to
the Republican plank, and with a

trusts would be a sufficient plank; but
as this trust plank also was substituted
by the full committee there is reason
to fear that it may not be in keeping
with the ideas of the candidate.
"The labor plank is all that could be
desired. It declares against Govern

vention at St. Louis, arrived here yes
terday on their way home. Colonel
Iaukea will address the Iroquols Club
this evening on political conditions In
the Hawaiian Islands.
Politicians generally incline to the
opinion that the successful .candidate
for the Senatorial prize will hail from
the south. A Republican leader yester
day sized up the situation in this fash
ion:
Senator Bard expressed himself as
delighted over the cordiality of his re
ception in San Francisco. Among the
callers at the Occidental Hotel yester
day were former Lieutenant Governor
Jaccb H. Neff of Placer County and
W. B. Hamilton, acting Collector of
Customs.
There are so many worthy aspirants
In the field that Senator Perkins Is
constrained by the fullness of his gen
erosity to give all of them his support.
It is common gossip in political circles
that the senior United States Senator
will not single out any aspirant for his
special favor and -will surely do noth
ing to impair the political fortunes of
his colleague in the Senate, for whom
he entertains the highest regard.
United States Senator Thomas R.
Bard and Dr. Chester Rowell left San
Francisco for Sacramento last evening
and will go south to-day. Many well
known citizens called at the Occidental
Hotel yesterday to pay their respects
to the visiting statesmen. Senators
Perkins and Bard met in friendly con
ference yesterday afternoon. The Sen
atorial situation was briefly reviewed
in a general way. -
"There are never friends like the old
friends. Friendship Is not a plant of
rapid growth. For more than a quar
ter of a century I have passed you day
by day. We met on the streets as we
were going about our several duties.
.We chatted 'together at the clubs and
met one another in social intercourse
at our respective houses. We sorrow
ed together when dear friends passed
away. Together we helped one anoth
er on occasions of need. We rejoiced
together when some great joy came

lation from the visitors. Judge Par
ker said:
A new sort of letters at hand to-day
were those of the parents who have
named their newly born children
"Alton," or â¢Parker" or boi:i, after
Judge Parker.
Congressman Bourke Cockran of New
York, August Belmont and William R.
Iiodcy of the Democratic State com
mittee arrived at Ksopus to-day and
were taken to Rosemount in Judge
Parker's carriage. They came on invi
tation of Judge Parker and did not
know what would be' the subject of the
conference or how long they would
stay. Cockran was asked if he would
take the stump for Judge Parker. '
"It is not necessary to ask that," he
replied.
He said" that he would support the
ticket with his whole heart.
Six carloads of enthusiastic friends
of Judge Parker came 1 down on a
special train to-night to celebrate the
Judge's nomination. Most of those
who came were Democrats, but there
were not a few old Republican friends
of the Judge and the celebration was
designed to be non-partisan In char
acter. Headed by the First Regiment
band of Kingston, the visitors marched
to Rosemont and gave Judge Parker
a rousing ovation.
"I shall go into the campaign before
us with a greater confidence of victory
than 1 have ever had before: nol even
excepting the campaign of 1876."
Henry Watterson, editor of the Louis
ville Courier - Journal, sent Judge
Parker a lot of clippings from his
paper, with a letter in which he con
gratulated the Judge, and concluded as
follows: t
early mail to-day and the Judge went
briskly at them. Among, the letters was
one from Richard Olney, dated Boston,
July 13, as -follows:
"You* must allow me to express my
great satisfaction that you are to be
the candidate of the Democratic party
for the Presidential office in the coming
election. That the party and the coun
try cannot be too emphatically con
gratulated is certain. Whether you can
fairly be congratulated personally I beg
leave to doubt. Your present position
is so exalted and so manifestly con
genial to your tastes and is filled with
so much dignity that leaving it for
politics cannot justly be imputed to
anything except patriotic sense of
duty."
"Pn the whole the platform is good.
From a Western standpoint its great
est defect is that it makes no mention
of the money question. An attempt
was made to secure a plank opposing
the melting of the silver dollars, op
posing the asset currency and branch
banks and expressing a preference for
the United States note (ordinarily
known as the greenback) over the bank
note; but, having refused to put in a
gold plank, the committee was not
willing to have any phase of the money
question alluded to.
"While the motion to reaffirm the
Kansas City platform was voted down,
there was a considerable vote In favor
of its reaffirmatlon and the Western
members of the committee, together
with a few from the South, stood to
gether and secured enough changes in
the platform to make it a presentable
document and worthy of the support
of the party."
the reduction of the army. Upon this
the committee was unanimous. The
sub-commitee reported a plank in
favor of an Increase of the navy, but
this was stricken out In the full com
mittee.
"The platform has a plank in favor
of the enlargement of the scope of the
Interstate Commerce Commission and
in favor of Irrigation. The general
clauses of the platform ertclte no dis
pute and the appeal against the intro
duction of a race issue ought to have
weight with the sober thinking Ameri
cans.

"During those years we formed re
lations of friendship with one another.
As one illustration of it we find that
twenty-six of you went to St. Louis
through the heat to say something
kindly of one of your friends of the
Kingston and Ulster County band as

And I know very well that they did
not tell the whole truth at St. Louis.
There is something about those friends
whom I have known so well these
years that makes it impossible for
them to tell the exact truth about a

to the several delegations . there they
failed to recollect aught but those
things which pictured their neighbor

has evolved a plan for a Rocky Moun

Denver, Salt Lake City and Butte, and
afterward to cover such cities as wish
to coma in. The plan involves the pur
chase of Overland Park at Denver and
the building of a race track at Salt
Lake to be operated in conjunction
with the present track at Butte.
Clark's first idea was to have meet
ings in three cities, like that which has
jug* closed at Overland, including har
ness and running races, but if the plan
for the circuit goes through, the racing
will have to be almost entirely for the
runners after the close of the meet-
Ing at Overland. Clark has opened ne

PARIS, July 14.â The death of. the
former President of the Transvaal,
Paul Kruger, at Clarens, Switzerland,
aroused widespread regret here, owing
to French sympathy for the Boer cause
and personal admiration for "Oom
Paul." When he recently left Mentone
his health was gradually failing
through old age, constitutional disor
ders and throat trouble, which threat
ened to extend to the lungs. However,
his personal physician, Dr. Heymann,
did not apprehend a speedy crisis, and
Kruger himself resisted the idea that
his physical powers were failing. He
had arranged to return to Mentone
next fall, releasing the picturesque villa
which he had occupied on the out
skirts of the town. Nevertheless, his
near friends recognized that Kruger's
once rugged constitution was gradually
going to pieces.
Visitors describe him as being a pa
thetic figure of calm endurance. His
eyesight had dimmed, but he sat much
at times with his Bible open before
him, muttering well-known passages.
He avoided reference to tne Boer war,
but when it was occasionally mention
ed he showed no resentment and ex
pressed the belief that providence
would eventually render Justice to the
Boer cause.

â¢'He will fail where greater than he

who then asked why should Parliament

by giving him power to which he was
not justly entitled.
Chamberlain concluded by ridiculing
the opposition.
Lord Tennyson moved a vote of con
fidence in the Government and the ap
proval of its finance policy, which was
unanimously carried.
Lord Lansdowne briefly acknowl
edged the resolution and said it would

mier Balfour.
LONDON, July 14.â Joseph Chamber
lain was elected president and Lord

which y.a.e attended by 1800 delegates
from. all part? of the kingdom. A n^s
oiution was passed in favor of a com
r!ete reform of the British fiscal sys
tem, approving the Premier's demand
i'or-increase<i powers to deal with hos- i
tile tariffs and "dumping." and ex
rressinR sympathy v.ith the proposals
for preferential arrangements between
the colonies and the motherland. The
resolution was adopted with practical
unanimity and Chamberlain, who pre
sided, pointed out that it must fairly
represent the views of the Liberal
unionists, as no fewer than 278 sepa
rate associations were represented at
ihe meeting.
The part taken by Lord Lansdowne
and Lord Selborne in the new organi
zation, which the Evening Standard
calls the "Annex Tariff Reform
League,' evoked much interest. The
Standard considers the /act that the
principal member of Balfour's Cabinet
have become vice presidents of an elec
tioneering association of which Cham
berlain is chief raises a grave constitu
tional question, and it is paid that the
opposition intends to raise the question
in the House of Commons and invite
Balfour to explain how two members
of his Cabinet come to be supporting a
policy so different from that enunciated
by the Premier himself.
Chamberlain presided over and de
livered a epeech at an immense meet-
Ing in Albert Hall to-night under the
auspices of the Liberal Unionist Coun
cil. In beginning his speech Chamber
lain, who was given a tremendous ova
tion, said that the organization of the
Liberal Unionist Council was primarily
for the maintenance of the union be
tween England and Ireland under the
control of one supreme council. There
was nothing in the present circum
stances to justify the relaxation of vig
ilance in this direction.
After discussing at length the finance
Question on practically the same lines
es in his former speeches. Chamberlain
returned to the Irish question and said
that the council was impressing upon
the Government the necessity of re
form in the Irish representation. The
leader of the Nationalist party in the
House of Commons controlled some
eighty votes which were swung from
side to side without regard to the
merits of the case and with the avowed
object of making the British Govern
ment impossible and coercing the Brit
ish Parliament to give him what he
wanted.

with patriotic fervor this afternoon
and evening in Shell Mound Park.
There was a great gathering of men
and women who can trace a direct or
indirect descent from France. The

though there were literary exercises,
the people preferred to romp about
the picnic grounds or dance the hours
away than listen to them. The at
tendance this evening was aug

play of fireworks served to amuse,
and the dancing was the favorite
pastime of many.

Had it not been for continuous rumor
from across the wide Atlantic that
George T. Marye Jr. and the widow
of his brother, the late Colonel William
A. Marye, were about to marry, the
news of their union 1 which has Just
come to the city would naturally have
broken upon society with something
akin to an unexpected cloudburst.
Colonel Marye of the United States
army died on May 13. 1903', a little more
than a year ago, in Washington, D. C.
His widow and her brother-in-law have
been in each other's company a good
deal of late. The attention that. George
Marye paid his beautiful and accom
plished sister-in-law was marked, and
those who had the privilege (of their
society watched the gallant attention
develop Into a strong devotion.
The couple were in Germany during
the spring and on June 28 they were
married in Berlin, the ceremony being
performed in the American Church on
Motz strasse, Nollendorff Platz.
The bride, who" was formerly: Miss
Doyle of Washington, is handsome and
a favorite in exclusive society circles
in the East. During the lifetime j of
Colonel Marye her receptions , were
among the most popular in the capital,
where they were attended , by leaders

When they left me both of the men warned
me to make no outcry. As soon as they left
me I hastened back and gave the alarm.
"See here," said the tall man. â¢"didn't the
police tell you to look out fcr us? What Â«re
tho?e men doinjr outside the fence?"
I tried to ullav their suspicions, but they
pressed the pistols to my back and ordered me
to move on. One of them grabbed my revolver
and the other got my star, after starting me
ahead of them. They k?pt me walking out by
way of the curve at the feet of Seventh street,
through to the new cannery near Ninth street,
then around back of t-lxteenth-street station as
far as Shell Mound.
1 said, "What's the matter, boys?" One of.
them replied: "Sonif fellow drove us out of a
box rar and we don't like that."
"Well. I can't help that," I said.
When I first sÂ»w the pair t>f robbers they
were Inside thÂ«* fence near the brick repair
fhop in the railroad yard at the foot of Cedar
Hreet. I had met Policemen Hamerton and
Thompson and was returning to join them with
a bullsÂ»ye lantern. The robbers wore standing
In the yard, and until I vraa elese enough to
them I thought they were Thompson and Ha
merton. As I approached the stranpers pulle<l
out pistols and ordered me to thruw up my
hands.
Rnilroad Policeman Cochran said
Cochran had not gone a great dis
tance when he was confronted by two
men. Both held revolvers In ! their
hands, which they quickly raised to a
level with the railroad policeman's
head. Cochran was taken by surprise.
He asked the men what they wanted
and in reply they ordered him to raise
Policemen Hamerton and Thompson
were sent to the West Oakland railroad
yards on the suspicion that the fugi
tives might make an attempt to leave
the city on the first outgoing freight
train. Hamerton and Thompson, when
they arrived at the yards, found Rail
road Policeman Cochran on his beat.
The officers informed the latter of the
saloon robbery and of their detail to
look about the yards. It was suggested
that the hunted men were probably
hiding in one of the empty box cars
and a search was proposed. None of
the men had a lantern and Cochran
went in quest of one. He had one in a
locker at the other end of the yards
and started away In the darkness to
get it.
CAPTURE THE OFFICER.
Wieking, when the robbers had de
parted, called up the poKio and told
what had happened. When the mes
sage was received Night Captain Wil
son immediately issued orders to as
many policemen as he could muster to
gethe/ tc search the city and. if possi
ble, to bring in the robbers. Details of
officers were dispatched throughout the
town, but for about- four hours there
were no results.
POLICE ARE NOTIFIED.
Shortly after 11 o'clock last night the
highwaymen held up and robbed the
saloon of Henry Wleking, at the corner
of Eighth and Washington streets. The
crime was particularly bold, as the
streets were brightly lighted and many
pedestrians were in the neighborhood.
One of the men wore a red mask, but
the other was not In disguise. Both
carried weapons, and when they en

ing, who Is a brother of the proprietjr
and who was in charge of the saloon,
to throw up his hands. The same or
der was given Albert Springer, the bar
tender, and Fred Josselyn, a customer.
While one of the thieves watched those
in the saloon the other passed behind
the bar and In a nervous manner open
ed the cash register and -
about $100 in coi/t. As abruptly as
they had entered the pair look their de
parture. Ones outside of the door they
pocketed their weapons and walked up
Eighth street to Clay.
Horace B. Cochran, a State railroad
policeman employed in the West Oak
land yards of the Southern Pacific
Company, encountered two highway
men for whom he was looking early
this morning, but instead of landing
the pair behind the bars, he was him
self taken prisoner, and. without wea
pon or star, compelled to march to
Shell Mound station, nearly two miles
distant, before he was given his liberty.
This stroke of daring on the part of the
thieves resulted In their escape, and the
police In several counties have been no
tified to watch for them.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, July 14.
Concerning his experiences, State
Cochran was glad to get away. He
started back in the direction whence
he had come, and the men stood side
by side with their revolvers pointed
at him, calling upon him to make no
outcry. Frnally, when they, were out of
sight, he broke Into a run and returned
to the railroad yards. A telephone
message was sent to police headquar
ters and more policemen were sent out
on, the new clew. Those who searched
the vicinity of Shell Mound, however,
found nothing, the men Tiaving made a
quick escape.
Chief of Police HodgklnB, when he ar
rived at his olHce this morning, took
the case in charge. Detectives and pa
trolmen reported to him the result of
their investigations, but no tangible
clew was obtained during the day. One
man, Joe Ranken, waa arrested in an
intoxicated condition and held In order
that he might be closely questioned.
It Is believed that the robbers board
ed a freight train and left the county!
Telegrams were sent to Port Costa to
arreat all auspicious characters, but no
men answering the description of the
highwaymen have yet been located.
The police have good descriptions of
the men. Wieklng- and those in the sa
loon could. identify the men again and
Cochran has a very good, idea of the
robbers' appearance. They may be
local men, but the detectives are of the
opinion that they are strangers in the
city, owing to the character of their
work. The fact that they Immediately
mado an attempt to leave the city after
committing a crime strengthens this
theory.
COCHRAX'S EXPERIENCE.
When within fifty feet of the Shell
Mound station Cochran waa ordered to
halt. He did so, and then he was told
that he would be given his freedom.
The man who had taken his revolver
removed the cartridges from the
weapon and passed it back to Cochran.

his hands.. Resistance was useless and
Cochran did not hesitate. While his
hands were above his head one of the
men stepped up to him. unfastened his
star and took away his pistol.
Then the daring crooks told the po
liceman that he might lower his hands,
but that he must do as they said.
There was a brief conversation in
which the thieves gave their orders
and then started Cochran in the direc
tion of the Shell Mound depot. Among
the suggestions the highwaymen made
to Cochran was that he was not to ob
serve them too closely. When he of
fered them his watch they found its
value was little and they returned it
to him. Then the march began.
Meanwhile Pollcemon Hamerton and
Thompson waited for the lantern.
Cochran; was in the lead and two long
pistols were held close to his back. The
trio passed the bathhouse at the head
of the Oakland mole, then took to the
railroad track. While going by the
Sixteenth-street station the thieves
displayed caution and took a circuitous
route with their captive. The tramp
continued and little was said. Occa
sionally the robbers reminded Cochran
that any attempt at trickery would re
sult in his death, but otherwise the
men were silent.

It was shown that the father is drunk
most of the time and that the mother
is not much better. They have sepa
rated six times, and the mother has
consorted with low characters. She
habitually smokes cigarettes and ht*r
fingers are stained with nicotine. After
hearing the testimony in thÂ«Â» case
Judge Ogden said he had no hesitation
in giving the children to the grand
parents, who are a respectable old
couple living in Alameda.
The three young children of Albert
and Lillian McPheters wore taken away
from them to-day by the order of
Judge F. B. Ogden and given to the
paternal grandfather. It was shown
that the parents had reached such a
degraded condition that they were not
fit to have the custody of them. The
mother made a scene in court when she
was called upon to give up her 8
year-old girl, the only child she had
with her, and declared that she would
fight before she would relinquish it.
She, however, was finally persuaded by
her husband to surrender the child
peaceably.
McPheters and his wife are younsr.
neither having reached the thirty-year
mark. They have been married about
ten years and have had six children.
Three of them are dead. The testimony
went to show that when one of their
children died, a short time ago, both
parents got drunk. A few weeks after
another died and. in order to avoid a
repetition, the grandparents, who were
caring for the child, buried it without
letting either of the parents know it
was dead.

"Business affairs had nothing to do
with this unfortunate occurrence. Bur
rows was broken-hearted over hisÂ»
wife's death, and brooded over it most
of the time. He talked the subject
over with me, and I tried to induce him
to take a vacation, thinking that a
change might help him. But Burrows
said he must stay, at work, which was
the only thing that could help him.
He was one of the best men in the
company's employ. He had thirty or
forty men under him, and he was a
faithful man."
Despondency and nervous prostration,
brought on through brooding over the
sudden demise of his helpmeet, are said
by those who knew Burrows intimately
to have been the causes that prompt
ed him to seek death. Since the death
of his wife he had been living at the
home of his sister-in-law, Mrs. J. A.
Thomas, of 646 Santa Clara avenue.
He left the house last evening after
dinner. 6aying that he felt nervous and
was going out for a walk. He did not
return at night and this fact was not
discovered until this morning, when
his sister-in-law, upon going to Bur
rows* room, observed that his bed had
not been disturbed. Where the de
spondent man spent the night ia not
known, but it is thought that he waa
not far from the spot where his wife
died. Burrows was observed by J. B.
McCauley wandering about his old resi
dence several weeks ago. McCauley
attempted to speak to Burrows, but
the latter avoided him.
Since the 5th of this month Bur
rows had been treated by Dr. M. W.
Brown for nervous prostration, and had
been advised by the physician to take
a sea voyage, which he intended to
do. Burrows' friends had noticed that
he was a changed man since the death
of his wife. She died on the 15th of
March, just after alighting from an
electric car in front of her home, 1335
High street.
Burrows was 3S years of age. His
brother-in-law, Thomas Burr, of 126S
Eighth avenue. East Oakland, has
taken charge of the arrangements for
the funeral, which will be held Satur
day afternoon at 1 o'clock from the
parlors of James Fowler.
J. S. Bunnell, auditor of the Wells-

Eurrows' suicide:
NO one witnessed the tragic deed,
but Emil Lundberg. employed at the
coal yard of Harry T. Moore, 1316 High

and saw the smoke from the weapon.
He reached the inanimate form of Bur

Hicks and O. E. Murdock. the crew of
an electric car, whose attention was at
tracted by the prostrate body of the
suicide. Deputy Coroner James Fowler
was notified and ordered the remains
taken to the local branch Morgue.
Burrows held the gun close to his
right temple and the bullet passed
through his head, the exit being close
behind the left ear. In falling after
the discharge he struck the macadam

'In an' interview this evening Di
rector Macdonald said: "The corpora
.tlon has been formed for the purpose
of completing this road. The papers
were filed in San Francisco for the
reason that the principal place of busi
ness is to be there. The time for the
franchise runs out on October 15 and
we purpose having the road in run
ning order by that time. So, you see,
we have not much time to lose. We
will begin work immediately. The Oak
land Transit has nothing to do with
this road, which will be operated by
our company. We do not need a power
house at the present time, as we can
buy all the power we want. We will
look out for that later on."
The Adams people, it Is thought, are
the most interested in the new concern,
and it is believed they are pushing the
completion of the road In order to give
them an outlet for their large holdings
near Adams Point. They have much
property along the proposed line be
yond the heart of the city, and it is
presumed that the main object of pro
jecting a line in this direction is to tap
their land.
It has been current street talk that
the Southern Pacific Company also had
interests in the road in connection with
projects to convert their steam local
train service in this city on Seventh
and Webster streets into electric lines.
The route to be traversed by the new
company's lines begins at the foot of
Broadway, near First street. The cars
will run up Broadway, from First to
Fifth street, along Fifth to Washing
ton, up Washington to Tenth, along
Tenth back to Brodway, up Broadway
to Fourteenth, along Fourteenth to
Webster, along Webster to the Boule
vard, thence across Adams Point to
Pleasant Valley and out to the ceme
teries. --
Articles of incorporation were flled
yesterday with the County Clerk of
San Francisco by the "Webster-street

000. News of the Incorporation of this
line, which has for its object the com
pletion of an electric railroad through
the heart of Oakland and extending
from the water front to the cemeteries,
occasioned no little interest bfere. The
franchise for this road was granted by
the City Council and the Board of Su
pervisors almost a year ago. It re
quires the work to be done by October
15, and it is expected that the roads
will be completed by that date.
The system is commonly called the
"corkscrew" line. By taking advan
tage of the provision of the law which
enables one company to use the lines of
another for five blocks the new corpor
ation can get from the water front
through the heart of the city without
being obliged to lay other than con
necting tracks with those of "the Oak

WILLOWS, July 14. â The most dis
astrous fire in the history of Glenn
County has been raging in the foothill
section to the west of this city for
the past two days. The fire has burned
over a strip of country fifteen miles
long, laying waste thousands of acres
of valuable pasturage and standing
grain. The greatest loss, however, Is
to the pastures, as most of the sec
tion swept by the fire is used as graz
ing land, and the loss to stockmen will
be enormous.
Nearly the whole of Clarks Valley
was burned over and much standing
grain destroyed. Farmers fought the
flames all day to save their homes and
to-night the fire has reached a point
directly west of here and is burning
in heavy stubble. Fanned by a strong
south wind, the flames are getting
alarmingly near the great fields of
standing grain and it is feared that
nothing can be done to stay the spread
of the fire. Hundreds of men are now
engaged in fighting the fire and all
available help is being rushed to the
scene and the men being promised
high wages. At a late hour to-night
it seems impossible to stay the flames
and the whole western section is
threatened. .
VALLEJO, July 14.â During the

The Grand Institute spent this af
ternoon considering the report of Miss
May Stein, the grand president. The
report complimented those who have
been working to preserve historic land
marks .and showed that the different
councils have contributed well to the
fund. According to the report more
than 2000 new members have been re
ceived into the order since the last

councils have been instituted. The
grand president mentioned the active

HEARS REPORTS
The price of beer in California may
climb the scale as rapidly as beef has
tone up in the East. Unless the boss
brewers concede the agreement sub
mitted by the Brewery Workers'
Union or agree to a conference with
the delegates authorized by the union
at last night's meeting to notify the
bosses of the action taken, there will
be a general strike all over the State at
I o'clock this afternoon.
At the meeting of the Brewery
Workmen's Union last night brewery
union men from all parts of the city
and Oakland were present. After the
situation was thoroughly discussed a
vote was taken on the question of en
forcing the demands of the union for
a schedule of 522 a week fpr six work
ing days and 75 cents for all overtime.
The new agreement, which was sub
mitted to and rejected by the bosses,
differs from the existing contract only
In the increase of %2 a week and in
the requirement that only one appren
tice to every ten men shall be em
ployed. The old agreement allowed
one apprentice to every five men and
the wages was ?20 a week and 50
cents for overtime.
RESOLUTION'S ADOPTED.
The following resolutions were
unanimously carried at the meeting:
Whereas. The brewery owners of this city
ha\e refused to enter into negotiations with
cur umon on the basis of new agreement pre
Â»'r.ted to the Brev.crs" Protective Association;
and.
Whereas. The said Brewers' Protective As
sociation is trying to fcrce the old contract
Â»!th revisions and changes detrimental to the
inti-rctt of this union on us and thereby make
cur conditions as wage workers worse than
they Â»vre before; therefore, be It
IWolved. That it is the sense of this union
that under no circumstances shall we allow
the. brewery owners to force the old contract
with those changes and revisions on us; and be
netolved. That Brewery Workers' Union No.
7 shall lay down their tools and all go on a
Urike <n Friday. July IS. at 5 p. m.. and stay
Â»:ut until the bosses seÂ« fit to confer and nego
tiate with this union on the basis of our new
agreement as submitted to them; and be it
Resolved. That the executive committee
fc<-,Jd a -racial meeting after the adjournment
< :' this meeting and appoint a committee to
notify the Â»..Â¦..-- of the result of the vote-
Taken Jjy the union. And. should the bosses
f.-.il to recognize the agreement submitted or
ajrroe to hold a conference with the delegates,
then the executive committee is hereby author
ized to call a strike.
It was explained by the secretary of
the union that the reason why to-day
is selected for action is that the old
agreement expires at 5 o'clock this
afternoon.
Telegrams were received from Los
Angeles favoring the strike, from San
Jose to the same purpose and from
Sacramento in opposition to it. Should
the strike be declared in this city every
brewery in the State will be affected,
as the union extends its jurisdiction to
all parts of California.
Five of the most important brew
eries in this city, it is said, will be
immediately placed under a boycott,
but the names of these are withheld
for the present by the union men.

The man who had a white elephant
on his hands must take a back seat
and let D. J. Sullivan have all the
calcium as the original and only "per
secuted kid." Sullivan has two houses
on his hands. He contracted two
months ago to move them from Hyde
and Ellis streets to Fillmore and Post
streets. He got them out into the
street, but the United Railroads wires
interfered with the journey.
The'best house jockeys that Sullivan
could hire could not make the dwellings
hurdle these barriers. He could not
coax them under the wires. All sorts
of suggestions were offered. One was
that Sullivan tow the houses behind a
balloon and drop them gently in their
new places. One man showed plans for
a tunnel by which the houses could be
shifted without inconvenience to the
United Railroads. Sullivan chased this
fellow three blocks with a mallet.
As soon as the houses were taken
from their foundations new flats were
started, which are now nearly finished.
Sullivan's houses are still In the street,
like a pair of wooden orphans out in
the cold world.
The Police Department classifies
them as the biggest pair of loafers
In the city. "They've been hanging
around the same corner for two
month*," pay the policemen on the
beat. "We can't get them to move on."
Whenever Sullivan has attempted to
cut wires to make way for his houses
threats of arrest have prevented him.
A section in the California Penal Code
makes the cutting of wires a felony.
Sullivan offered to guarantee the price
el repairing the lines but it was re
fused. Yesterday he sued for an in
fused.
First the United Railway Company
protested against its wires being
touched and enjoined Sullivan. The
house mover went to court and was
told that he had a right to move the
shacks, but must do so at the United
Roalroads' convenience. Then the San
Francisco Gas and Electric Company
maintained that its wires were sacred.
That was the last straw.
Yesterday he sued for an injunc
tion to prevent Chief Wittman
from arresting him when he starts to
cut his way out of the dilemma. Judge
Troutt will pass upon the case. Mean
while the shacks are still loafing around
the corner. The residents of the dis
trict contemplate applying for a pound
for ownerless houses.

Both White and McNamara were
taken to the Central police station and
closely questioned as to the fight.
Neither would make ' any charge
against the other and they were finally
permitted to ro free.
Dr. Cox said that the wounds ap
peared to have been inflicted by a dull
instrument. There were four incised
wounds on the scalp, cutting through
the skin. It took twelve stitches to
sew them up.
White, considerably sobered by this
time, admitted that he had been the
aggressor, and at first protested that he
did not know the man who had hurt
him. McNamara later admitted that
he had ejected White from the saloon,
but denied that he had intentionally
struck him on the head.
McNamara said: "White came into
the saloon early this evening in a state
of intoxication. * He tried to raise a
rough house and I tried to keep him
quiet. He then pulled out a revolver
and began to poke me in the ribs with
it in a semi-jocular manner. I ob
jected and told him to leave the place.
He refused. I then took hold of him
and put him out. He "was flourishing
the gun all the time. As we went out
together through the door I managed
to get hold of the gun. A scuffle en
sued. We fell down. In the mean
time the gun was accidentally ex
ploded. I do not know how White
got the cuts on his head. I did not
mean to hit him. Perhaps I did it
â¢with the butt end of the gun. I did
not shoot at him. When the scuffle
was over we came back into the sa
loon. His friends took away the re
volver."
J. D. Leonard, who was passing up
Geary street at the time, said he saw
two men engaged in an altercation in
front of the Turtle Saloon. They were
moving around. Suddenly he heard a
pistol shot, and in a few seconds after
ward he heard another. He rushed up
the street, but before he got there the
affair was over, and he found White
at the wash basin in the saloon wash
ing off the blood stains. He then took
White to the office of Dr. L. C. Cox,
who sewed up the wounds in his head.
A crowd quickly gathered. White
was taken to the saloon and then to
the office of Dr.L. C. Cox, at 233 Geary
street, where his wounds were dressed.
McNamara snatched the pistol from
him, and then White grappled with
him. They rolled over on the sidewalk,
and when White got up he had four
deep scalp wounds on his head, ap
parently the result of blows from the
revolver in McNamara's hands. Then
the shots were fired. .
J. D. White, a racetrack man and
horse ' owner, living at 1820 Market
street, was severely cut about the head
shortly after 12 o'clock this morning
by John McNamara, proprietor of the
Turtle cafe, an unlicensed saloon at
Powell and Geary streets. White had
been drinking in the saloon. He be
came so noisy and flourished a revolver
so recklessly that McNamara ejected
him. The two men grappled on the
sidewalk, went down and in the scuffle
McNamara got the pisioi away from
White and struck him on the head.
As White rose to his feet, the saloon
keeper fired two shots, but neither bul
let hit the horseman.
White had spent some time in the
saloon and created considerable dis
turbance. He was carelessly twirling
his reVolver about his finger and Mc-
Namara told him to put it in his
pocket. This he refused to do and the
proprietor started to put him out of
the saloon.

WafRer's Seff-Puffinrj Corkscrew Free to Want Advertisers in Sunday's CaffA London "Bobby's" Memory.
The best memory has its moments
of bewilderment or aberration; and the
other day a policeman at the Guildhall
Irish Exhibition, London, had his sus
picions retrospectively aroused, he
hardly knew how, as he stood before
the first picture on the line. It was
the wholly innocent face of a lady, a
lady, too, who is a favorite with all the
innocence of England, that loves stories
free from cruelty or any such stain.
The portrait was "No. 1" in the cata
logue, and It represented Miss Kath
arine Tynan. The city policeman was
baffled in presence of his vague uncom
fortableness. Then he remembered.
He was back again in . the days -of
dynamite, when another "No. 1" was a
terrorâ and bore, too, the name of Ty
nan.
t t j HEN an occasional migratory mosquito loses
\/\/ its way and arrives in this city or, inbued with
Â¦ Â» an exploring turn of mind, announces its arrival
here by presenting a bill oÂ£ a size to make a tailor
despair, its succulent San Francisco â¢ victim smashes
desperately at the culex pipiens in a strenuous endeavor
to make its tyrief life briefer. The San Franciscan recks
not that his wild and fruitless swing into space simply
serves to nag his uninvited guest to more spirited efforts
to eat him and perhaps tends to locate its lumpy work
in a spot less desirable than that first provided for in
the specifications.
Instead of waxing wroth at being served raw through
the business end of the culex, let him give thanks that
his guest didn't bring along its whole Simuliidae family,
from the little toddling culexes up to the old bald-headed
vampires and gailinippers with their trunks and suit
cases, to spend a summer outing on > him like they do*
The Baltimore Herald of June 30 prints the following
warning to its inhabitants: ' "The latest news is that a

Redding peace officers have been much disturbed to
solve a perplexing problem presented in the surrender
of a self-confessed burglar who cannot be convicted

guising the motive, send him where he belongs to join
the band of incoTrigibles in a penitentiary?
Every one knows that Mexican silver
dollars circulate In the Far East, espe
cially in China. But it seems the Mexi
can minting is noÂ£ enough of a certifi
cate of character. A peso that has long
been in circulation in China is covered
with Chinese characters. The bankers,
of whom there are hundreds in China,
who receive Mexican dollars affix to
them their seals to guarantee their
legitimacy, and as pesos circulate and
go from one bank to another they are
being marked bv all banks which re
ceive them. In case the peso proves to
be illegal the banker who sealed it last
has to change It for good money and
withdraw it from circulation. When the
pesos are completely covered with seals
they are sent back to Mexico to be re
coined, the expense being paid by all
the bankers whose seals are seen on the
coin. It is in accordance with a recent
agreement. But it often happens that
dollars, although marked all over their
two faces, continue in circulation and
are highly esteemed, as the seals are
so many guarantees that they are gen
uine. The decision to seal pesos was
taken because illegal coins began to cir
culate in China.
"Sealed Pesos."
The English are a music loving na
tion, and they love to hear music even
when going about their daily occupa
tions, and so it is that the spires and
towers of their mighty cathedrals are
hung full of glorious bells. So fond of
bell ringing is "Merrle England" that
Handel once said the bell is her na
tional instrument. It is not strange,
therefore, that we find this instrument
frequently adopted as a public sign.
From early in the seventeenth century
Bell Inns were numerous in London. In
Knightrider street there was an . old
inn, the walls of which were prefaced
with a giant bell carved in bold relief,
the keystone had the initials "M. T.
A." and the date 166S. This fine speci
men is now in Guildhall. But a little
step away, In Carter lane, there was
another Bell Inn, which has the proud
distinction of being the hostelry from
which Richard Quyney wrote, in 159S,
to his "loving good ffrend and coun
treyman, Mr. Wilm Shakespeare," the
only letter addressed to the Bard of
Avon now known to exist. The letter
is preserved in Stratford, the home of
the world's greatest poet. . Not iar
away, again, there is a modern bell
tavern, a place where it is said Dickens
loved to go when making notes for
"David Copperfleld."
One of the most ancient and reputa
ble wholesale druggists in the city,
while rebuilding on his oW site, dug out
of the foundations of the ancient house
an old sign of "The Bell and Dragon."
It had lain there for more than 200
years, having been used on a prior
building before the disasters of the
great flre, and had fallen through into
the general ruins. The peculiarity of
the situation is that the firm had
adopted "The Bell Dragon" for their
trademark before the discovery of the
fire-touched relic. This splendid old
stone bas-relief is Jealously preserved,
and occupies a prominent place In the
entrance 1 of the Holborn branch of the
firm. â St. Nicholas.

At the recent Victoria Hospital ba
zaar quite a number of American wom
en present were anxious to obtain the
Queen's autograph, but Mrs. Henry Sie.
gel turned out to be the only fortunate
one. Her application was supported by
three of the Queen's most intimate
friends, namely, the Duchess of Marl
borough. Mrs. Ronalds and Mrs. Arthur
Paget. Much astonishment is expressed
at the success of Mrs. Siegel, consider
ing that she is but a newcomer on the
scene of English fashionable, society.
Mrs. Frank Mackey, who is also shin
ing in society now, was in the running
for an autograph, too, but her backing
was not strong enough, although she
had the support of the Dowager
Duchess of Roxburghe and Mrs. Willie
LONDON. June 28.â Supposedly at?
his American wife's suggestion, the lit
tle Duke of Marlborough started in to
be a real hustler not long ago, but his
effort has had rather an unhappy end-
Ing. It hasn't been entirely wasted,
however, Tor it has shown over again
what happy-go-lucky methods obtain
In the British Government service and
vhat determined opposition is likely
to be met with by any one who, like the j
I>uke. attempts to introduce something j
like efficiency.
Marlborough's effort to stir up things j
s bit was made when his Grace receiv- J
ed the appointment of Under Secretary j
of State for the Colonies. Soon after !
tnkir.s hold of the reins he introduced
into his department what both the per
manent officials and underlines there
considered revolutionary departures.
From 10 o'clock until 4 were the hours j
1 ecujrnized by the Duke's predecessor, j
but the new Under Secretary insisted I
that the 4 should be made 5 in future,
end whenever he found that the work
of the office was getting behind he had
h notice posted up to the effect that
until the men had caught up they must
be at their desks at 9 every morning.
The Duke set the example.
But in the eyes of the staff this policy
cf the Duke's was simply a demand for |
f.vo hours' extra duty without extra pay
and the Under Secretary's department
became at once a hotbed of disaffection.
Many of the clerks asked to be trans
ferred to some other department of the
tiovernmtnt and most of the rest
threatened to strike. Sorest of all were
the so-called "permanent officials."
These elderly fossils, who previously
had been in the habit of getting down
et 11 o'clock in the morning, felt that
the Duke had done each of them a per
sonal injury in introducing what they
described as his "arbitrary methods." '
Before long a deputation representing
the office staff waited upon the Duke
to ask if the good old easy times
<-ouldn't come back again, but the Duke
declared he meant to carry out the
work of his department in his own
way, as he believed it to be to the pub
lic interest. The next move was a reg
ular conspiracy on the part of the staff
to set about their duties in a go-as
you-please sort of fashion, with the re-
Fult that the work soon got into a sim
ply chaotic state.
Undoubtedly the Duke would have
peen the thing through had he met
Â¦with any support from his own supe
riors, but the contrary was the case. I
understand that It was suggested to
him ' r his chief in office that he had
better knuckle under and he now has
done so. In fact, it is said the. Duke
is now going on the other tack and at
tempting to conciliate the permanent
officials of his department by inviting
them to Blenheim for "week ends" and
taking them up the river in his steam
launch. . . i
"Bertie" Croker, the ex-boss's eldest
son. Inherits his father's great physi
cal strength and is one of the most
enthusiastic members of the Gaelic
Athletic Association of London, which
recently got itself into bad odor by
refusing soldiers wearing the King's
uniform admission .a its games. Tug
of-war is one of young Croker's favor
ite pastimes and, on account of his
great strength, he generally fills the
position at the end of the rope.
I fancy <hat "Bertie" Croker is too
much occupied with looking after his
bulldogs, running his father's dairy
farm and playing the man about town
to spend much time in considering the
Â¦wrongs of Ireland, so it isn't likely that
his membership in the Gaelic Athletic
Association indicates any feeling "agin
the Government" on his part. The
members generally, however â all young
Irishmen â are rather rabid on the sub
ject and this in spite of the fact that
most of them are in the English civil
â¢ervice. They are employed mainly in
the Custom-house â outside of which
they do a great deal of practicing in
the way of athletics. Young Croker,
of course, has nothing to do with the
civil service, but comes down to take
part in the tugs-of-war. * r -
It is one of the rules of the Gaelic

The convention was a silver convention; every South
ern leader that slobbered about Judge Parker's super
sensitive honor is a silver man. The party was not re
organized. It was jobbed n a masterly way by Hill,
Cable, Belmont and Davis. It is a radical body with a
conservative head. The convention bit its thumbs and
obeyed orders, but nine-tenths of the delegates went
away cursing the man it nominated. The ticket is a
composite. It has a -judicial head and a trust tail, for
ex-Senator Davis has increased his fortune by syndi
cating coal mines and iron mines, and the roots of his
millions run to intertwine with the interests of every
combination in the country. That is why he is nomi
nated.
According to the platform the head of the ticket is
expected to bite th,e tail, and we have introduced into
politics that amusing spectacle often furnished by a
puppy when he discovers his tail and goes chasing it.
The head of the ticket is expected to be conservative and
respectable, while the tail, ordered by Belmont and
Cable, will see that the trusts which want Roosevelt's
head put up the wherewithal to make a campaign.
But above the jingle of the coin is the conviction of
every honest man that Judge Parker's character has suf
fered an injury by his post-nomination declaration. Had
he made a sign six weeks ago he would not have been
considered in the convention. After his nomination his
declaration was equivalent to a demand that the party
take him or commit suicide, as it would have done by
dropping him, as he deserved, and trying to find a new
AFTER all the political hullabaloo of the last four
years the Democratic party is not reorganized.
It is in the hands of the same men who led it into
the wilderness in 1896. A bunch of millionaires â Ben
Cable of the Rock Island Railroad family, August Bel
mont of the trusts, and Henry G. Davis, coal magnate â
have succeeded in nominating a colorless and conserva
tive gentleman, of fine character, for the Presidency, but
the lost party has not changed nor abjured a single
heresy that it wore through the two campaigns.
Parker is the candidate, but Bryan is more powerful
than he. When he dared the committee on resolutions
to put a gold standard plank in the platform, it did not
dare. When the' New York World nagged Judge Par
ker into a sense of the situation, and he wired that he
was a supporter of the gold standard and would not run
iPthe convention did not wish him, the leaders had hot
conference. And who were they? John Daniel oi Vir
ginia, Tillman of South Carolina, Vardaman and . Wil
liams of Mississippi, Carmack of Tennessee, and Champ
Clark of Missouri. They decided what should be done
in the matter.
While the committee on resolutions was discussing the
platform, Davfd B. Hill was asked if Judge Parker
favored the gold standard and he answered: "No one
knows; no one has ever heard him express ah opinion on
that subject." Hill was the manager of Parker's fight;
he is Parker's most intimate friend, and gave him his
first appointment to office, and yet. he declared that he
did not know his friend's position on the gold standard,
and that no one knew. When the New York World had
compelled Judge Parker to send the declaratory tele
gram, and the group of leaders, all from the South, ap
peared before the convention, Mr. John Sharp. Williams
was selected as a common mouthpiece to introduce the
subject, and said: "There was not in this vast assem
blage one single man who did not already know that
Judge Parker was a gold standard man." Yet David
B. Hill was there, and the one interrogation that ran
like a fugue through the convention related to Judge
Parker's position on the standard, and no one knew.
For months before the convention the demand rose
from the party everywhere that his position be made
known, but was unanswered. Then when the commit
tee on platform and the Southern leaders had invented
the convenient fiction that the monetary standard was
not in issue and therefore need not be referred to, Judge
Parker proved that it is in issue by his declaratory and
defiant telegram. His approval of the Republican
policy of a gold standard put his party in a humiliat
ing if not contemptible position. Did he keep silence
on that question so long by advice of David B. Hill?
Was it not known that if he declared for gold before
the nomination his selection would be impossible? Was
not the platform omission a trick to quiet the silver
men, get cdntrol of the convention, nominate Parker
and then spring the trap when it was too late to go
back? It has every mark of a trick â an expert, fony
and scientific trick such as Mr. Hill is in the habit of
playing. To make it possible he told the platform com
mittee that no one knew Judge Parker's views on the
standard, and that they had never been uttered. This
permitted -the play which was intended to bring out the
supersensitive honor of the Sphinx of Esopus, and the
Southern jury that sat 'upon the situation all walked
over on that single thread stretched by the Wizard of
Wolfert's Roost.
If the war is rough on men it is
rougher still on horses, if the ghastly
stories which slowly reach St. Peters
burg from Mukden. Kharbin and the
Baikal are worthy of credence. And
as they appear in the local press, which .
is subject to Government censorship*
_ihere are no good grounds for doubting
them. In the Baikal the lot of the
wretched horse, was and is peculiarly
doleful. Owing to the vast number of
them required to draw the trains over
the ice of the Baikal Lake, and to con
vey sleighs full of soldiers and cars
laden with war material, the prices
of hay and oats rose by leaps and
bounds. It soon, became unprofitable
for the owner of one of three over
worked quadrupeds to invest any money
in fodder, and lucrative to let the ani
mals work on almost unceasingly with
nothing but cold water to keep up their
strength until at last the horse dropped
down dead from exhaustion. The rea
son is, writes the Eastern Review, that
the prices for the labor of horses are
abnormally great â so great that they
enable the owner to purchase a new
: one and to lay by a large percentage
for himself. The heartlessness of these
men is described as revolting. Ema
ciated with hunger and jaded with ex
hausting, almost uninterrupted work,
many of these miserable horses were
abandoned to their fate before they
fell dead in harness. Hardly
able to put one foot before the other,
they wandered aimlessly over the
Baikal ice, vainly seeking for grass or
other fodder, and "at the sight of hu
man beings neighing piteously." â Lon

THE California State Board of Trade has appointed
a committee to find out how California wheat can
be so improved in its percentage of gluten as to
insure to itself exclusively the home market afforded by
flour mills, of this State. The fact is announced that it
is necessary to import to California from South Dakota
and Kansas large quantities of their wheat to mix with
California grain in the manufacture of strong flour for
the Oriental trade. By strong flour is meant that which
has sufficient gluten.
Not all wheat produced in this State is deficient in
this- constituent, but enough is lacking in it to make
wheat importation unavoidable as the matter now
stands. There are vast areas in California that are ca
pable of producing wheat in large quantities. The soil
is adequate to the growing of strong wheat. The dif
ficulty would seem to be, in large part, as represented
by Horace Davis, who was called in to advise with the
State Board of Trade, that the farmers are not using
the proper seed to raise the right sort of wheat for
milling purposes. /
The interest of the Agricultural College connected
with the University of California has been enlisted in
the inquiry that is now about to be made by the com
mittee of the State Board of Trade. The personnel of
the committee includes the president and general man
ager of the State Board of Trade, Professor Shaw of the
University of California, Horace Davis and T. C. Fried
lander, the last named being the secretary of the Mer
chants' Exchange, which is largely concerned in the fu
ture of California wheat.
In a preamble that the Board of Trade has adopted it
is set forth that wheat is brought from Dakota and Kan
sas to be mixed with the California product to raise the
grade of flour manufactured in California; that Cali
fornia flour for export to the Orient would bring a
higher price if it contained a larger percentage of
gluten than can now be obtained from California grown
wheat; and that if California farmers would maintain
their position in ( competition with wheat grown in any
other State it is important that the quality of their
product be made as high as possible.
There are few topics of more live interest at home
than this. From the inquiry good effects reasonably may
be expected. In some sections, so it is said, the quality
of the' wheat can be easily raised by fertilizers. The
wheat of former years in California had more gluten,
as a whole, beeause it was of other stock. Club wheat,
so called, does not fill all the requirements, although it
is popular among farmers for various reasons, one of
which is that it is Ies3 easily whipped out by high winds
than other varieties are. Horace Davis informs the
State Board of Trade that there is not enough new seed
brought in to keep up the gluten. The tendency of
wheat is to run down in gluten and to get a growing
Pursued to its logical end the present inquiry ought
to throw on the subject of wheat-growing in California
a flood of scientific knowledge, based on experience,
which will in the long run be of value to all wheat
growers. As soon as accurate information is reached
as to the exact requirements there will be little difficulty
in providing what is needed. The fact that gluten was
not formerly lacking and that it was sufficiently abun
dant for nearly half a century of farming in California
conclusively prove that some methods and not the con
ditions are at fault. The sooner the remedy is applied
the better for the State at' large. The State Board of
Trade is doing good service in coming to' the front in
this matter.

When Judge Parker learned the conditions upon

Since the earthquake in Palestine
last April some one circulated the story
that the mouth of the river Jordan had
been so affected by the shock that the
level of the river had been altered to
such an extent that at the place where
the historic river goes into the Dead
Sea there was now a waterfall of con
siderable depth and strength. This is
altogether false, and no change what
ever has taken place at or near the
mouth of the Jordan.
The writer has Just spent some days
there and has made it his special busi
ness to investigate this matter. Much
has also appeared in periodicals about
steamboats navigating the Dead Sea.
This, too. Is a fabrication. The only
boat on the Dead Sea is a small sail
ing boat, about twenty feet long. This
vessel makes trips as the wind allows,
from the north end of the sea to the
bay on the eastern side of the tongue
that divides the water near the mid
dle. Here at this terminus some Jew*
are located. The whole concern is, in
fact, in the hands of the Jews, who,
at a low rate, buy wheat and barley
from the Arabs, to be delivered on the
seashore. From there it is shipped to
the Jericho side and carried on don
keys to Jerusalem, where it finds a
ready sale at a good price.
When adverse winds blow the little
craft is in danger of being swamped,
for the so-called Dead Sea becomes a
living mass of waves. The writer re
cently spent four nights such aa never
will be forgotten on these waters, and
the smartness of the old man at the
helm and his boy with the three sails
saved us from being shipwrecked again
and again. A charge of one mejedie

United States Commissioner Heacock
of the Northern District of California
enjoys the distinction of being the best
Judge of Chinese liars in the United
States. He has had before him thou
sands of Chinese who had been refused
admission by the Chinese Bureau and
who had taken out writs of habeas
corpus, alleging that they were born
in the United States. The witnesses
and the applicant have the same story
to telL All the witnesses remember
plainly that Ah Jim, the petitioner,
was born at 721 Dupont street. In room
27, second floor, at five minutes after
noon on the sixth day of the seventh
month of the fifteenth year of Kwang
Suey. They remember when he was
taken to China by his parents and they
remember seeing him in his uncle's
house in the village of Sam Suey on
the occasion of his uncle's wedding.
On all such hearings the Commis
sioner allows only the witness on the
stand to be in the room. Everything
goes on smoothly until Judge Heacock
takes up the cross-examination. He
requires the witness to draw a diagram
of the uncle's house, showing the loca
tion of the several rooms. Then he
asks whether the house stands on a
hill or on the level, the number of
guests present at the wedding and oth
er details about which the witnesses
are not likely to be coached. Then the
adaptability of the coolie temperament
for perjury becomes apparent. In one
case some of the witnesses swore that
the house stood on a hill, some on the
level ground, some in a swamp, others
around the corner and any old place;
that the house contained four rooms,
six rooms, seven rooms; that there
were ten, twenty, forty and fifty
guests, etc. In the face of so many
contradictions the Judge decides that
the witnesses are liars and that the ap
plicant Is not a native son of the Unit
ed States and must be sent back to
China.

Green added that Bert Hampstead
and Morris Lane were his employers.
They, in turn, had been employed by
Captain Siebe, the lessee of the park.
Owing to the absence of witnesses
from Oakland the taking of testimony
was postponed indefinitely.
"We did our duty as well as we
could. We stopped lots of fight. They
had been fighting all over the place
since 9 o'clock In the morning." , ..
Coroner Leland asked whether there
was no way of getting the Injured man
to Emeryville for treatment and Green
replied that it would take a long time
to do that. Besides, Wolfe was in the
hands of his friends.
"Did you report this affair to the
Sheriff?" was the next inquiry.
"I didn't know he was dead until
the next day, when I saw It in the pa
pers," was the answer.
Witnesses yesterday told the Cor
oner's jury the story of a series of
drunken fights in the barroom at the
dancing pavilion in Shell Mound Park,
Emeryville, on July 4, which resulted
in the death of Julius Wolfe, a veteran
of the war with Spain.
Wolfe attended a picnic at that
place with four friends and in a free
for all fight was felled to the floor at
9:30 o'clock in the evening by some
person unknown. His friends carried
his unconscious body to the ferry-boat
and when they arrived at the foot of
Market street In this city they took
him to the Harbor Hospital, where
he was .treated for alcoholism. Dr
Boacowitz not discovering that Wolfe's
skull was badly fractured. Wolfe died
on the following morning, never hav
ing recovered consciousness. Wit
nesses swore yesterday that there was
a succession of fights at the dancing
pavilion from 9 o'clock in the morn
ing until late at night and that nearly
all the picnickers were drunk. There
were three Oakland constables on the
ground, but they did not interfere with
the Bacchanalian orgies.
This fact was brought out by the
testimony of Charles Green of Oak
land, a deputy constable, appointed
by Constables Hampstead and Lane.
Green said that he saw Wolfe lying
unconscious on the ground, but as his
friends were taking care of him he did
not interfere. The picnickers were
fighting all day, he said.
"It seems to me very strange," re
marked the Coroner, "that seeing a
man lying unconscious after a fight
the constable did not make any inquiry
aa to the person who had inflicted the
injuries."
"Hadn't time," said Mr. Green
cheerfully. "We had to herd them
like cattle all day and we had our
hands full."
"Do the Oakland people stand for
that sort of thing?" asked the Coroner.
"Oh, it's the same all the time
there," replied Green.
"Did none of the officers attempt to
see what had happened?"
"Well," was the response, "we tried
to keep them from fighting as much
as we could."
"Does the Sheriff allow that kind of
business in Alameda County?" the
Coroner continued.
Flattering reports of the improve
ment in the sweeping of streets since
the city undertook the work were re
ceived from various sources and or
dered filed.
Grades were ordered established on
Mission street at various points pre
paratory to the bitumir.izing of the
street, for which $SO,000 has been ap
propriated.
Plans were ordered prepared for an
engine-house on Twentieth street, near
Missouri, the intention being to erect
the building before the rain sets in.
Some three years ago the badges to
the number of forty were Issued by
resolution of the board and among
them were eight allowed to as many
inspectors for the purpose of deter
mining the rates of insurance based
on the safety of the buildings. One
employe of the Fire Underwriters,
whose name President Schmitz has
been unable to ascertain, used his
badge, it is alleged, for his own pur
poses and several contractors of build
lnars !n course of construction com
plained of his tactics to the board. No
charges of extortion, however, are
irade against the man who imperson
ated a building inspector.
After calling in the old badges the
board will issue new badges to its own
employes only. These will have a par
ticular number so that the public may
identify the man in case of any wrong
duing-. Schmitz says that the extent
cf the lrres~ularif.ps cannot be ascer
tained owing to the incomplete condi
tion cf the records kept when the
badges were Issued, but that in future
ripid regulations will be adopted for
those holding the badges.
The board was compelled to deny a
petition for the Improvement of Third
avenue, between I street and Parnas
sus avenue, because the Supervisors
refused to appropriate funds for the
Improvement cf streets in front of city
property, although the board had re
quested tlS7,S62 for the purpose. The
lack of funds will retard improvements
to such an extent on that account that
the board will again ask the Supervis
ors to appropriate some money from the
urgent necessity fund to tide over the
difficulty as far as possible. All such
applications will have to be denied un
less the city agrees to do its share of
the work. "
The board ordered the construction
of stone sidewalks on both sides of
Spear street, between Market and Mis-
Eion.
It having been brought to the atten
tion of the Board of Public Works that
some employe of the Board of Fire Un
derwriters had represented himself as
n building inspector employed by the
city for the purpose of Intimidating
contractor?, the board yesterday took
summary action by recalling all badges
heretofore issued to employes of the
department and to insurance inspec
tors.
The two youths under arrest were
taken to the City Prison and booked
on a charge of burglary. One gave
the name of John Benson and his oc
cupation as a bellboy and the other
Thomas P. Gere, alias Thomas Mc-
Lain, and said he lived on remittances
sent by his parents from Sioux City,
Iowa. .Each is 17 years of age. They
claimed to have known Love for the
last three months and visited his room
for a joke. They had packed up sev
eral pairs of socks, several . handker
chiefs, other articles of wearing ap
parel and a lady's gold watch, all of
which were booked as evidence
against them.
When searched at the City Prison a
skeleton key was found in Benson's
pockets and it is supposed they ef
fected an entrance by means of the
key. They positively refused to di
vulge the "name of the youth who made
his escape.
A woman's cries of "Stop thief! stop
thief!" awakened people from their
slumbers in the neighborhood of Tay
lor and Geary streets early yesterday
morning. The woman was Mrs. Wil
liam Blythe, 511 Taylor street. Po
licemen O'Brien and Orr had seen a
light in the front room of the Blythe
residence and were wondering at the
unusual sight when they saw three
youths running out of the front door
and heard Mrs. Blythe's voice. The
policemen grabbed hold of two of the
youths and the third made his escape.
The ' policemen returned to the
Blythe residence with the two prison
ers. Mrs. Blythe said she had been
awakened by a noise coming from
a room occupied by a friend, Howard
Love. She threw on a wrapper and
went to the room, where she was sur
prised to see three youths busily en
gaged in ransacking the room. She
caught hold of two of them, but after
a brief struggle they broke away from
her. and ran from the house, the other
having preceded them. Then she ran
to â¢ the front door and shouted "Stop
thief!"

Annie Gaynor, who makes life un
pleasant for Joseph Donahue of 136
Seventh street every time she drinks to
excess, asked for a change of venue
from Judge Fritz's court to some other
police tribunal, as she thought that,
in view of her frequent appearances in
department 3, she would fare better at
the hands of some other magistrate.
So her case was transferred to Judge
Mogan, who ordered that she be held
on probation until September 14. Miss
Gaynor's specialty is window-smash
ing and in the district south of Market
street she has provided much work for
glaziers.
Inability of Attorney Frank Murphy

Kate Blackwell, whose drunkenness

the Coroner's inquest.

Judge Fritz dismissed the charge of
embezzlement against E. L. Water
man, treasurer of the local aerie of
Eagles, on the ground that the testi
mony was Insufficient to justify con
viction.
Miss Belle Dougherty of Oakland told
Judge Slogan of how she had been in
veigled into investing $150 cash and a
note for $350 in stock of the Raven
Publishing Company by Theodore
Lowe, manager of the corporation, and
of how she discovered that it was a
losing venture. She declared that Lowe
said he wanted a lady of literary at
tainments to take charge of a monthly
periodical known as "The Raven," and
that the person who obtained the posi
tion must purchase some of the com
pany stock, as he believed that a pro
prietary interest would conduce to more
faithful service. Subsequently she ac
cepted the position of proofreader on
the prescribed condition and when she
discovered that "The Raven" was a
feeble bird she demanded but failed to
get the money she had put up for its
maintenance. Further testimony will
be heard next Monday.

Podesta denied paternity of the babe

he was given until to-day to make pro

who was ordered to pay his divorced
wife $15 a month by Superior Judge
Hebbard, thought he could elude the
obligation when that jurist went away
on vacation, but the woman had him
arrested and compelled to pay up.
Among the defendants before Judge
Fritz were several male parents who
had failed to contribute to the support
of their minor offspring. Philip J.
Kelley got thjrty days' imprisonment
for letting his wife provide for his
three children. Alc-ander O'Brien
As she stood before Judge Mogan and
heard herself accused of ' vagrancy
Anita Lansing was engaged in a strug
gle with her blonde coiffure, from
which an ash-colored "rat" seemed
bent on escaping. With teeth tightly
clenched upon a number of hairpins,
thereby impeding her articulation, she
declared that the policeman simply
lied whe-i he accused her of roaming
the red light district at all times o*
night, and he must have mistaken her
for some other "lady." She would
have him distinctly understand that
she came of good familyâ folk who
could buy and sell him a dozen times
over and then have more money than
he had ever seen. If she was not mis
taken he would live to bitterly regret
the hour he had deprived her of free
dom. She was still talking and
wrestling w|th a "rat" when the Judge
continued the case till next Monday.
' One night in prison made Edward
Green, barber, such a miserable looking
object that Judge Fritz fined him only
$10 for having sent an obscene picture
to a candy girl by messenger boy. Th<;
indiscreet tonsorial artist looked as if
his brief incarceration had deprived
him of at least one-third of his wonted
avoirdupois, and his clothes hung
loosely upon his bowed form.
Nolan then testified that he placed
the bottle to his nostrils and smelled
its contents, and the odor was of lager
beer. No, he could not possibly affirm
that it was not root beer. One of the
ladies left her glass untasted, but the
other lady considerately drank It after
consuming Jier own allotment.
Case continued till next Monday to
give defense time in which to*prove
non-intoxicating quality of stuff or
dered and paid for by Nolan.
If the wise chieftain had been more
particular In his instructions to the
novices they might have crowned his
experiment with success and them
selves with glory. With victory fairly
v. ithin their grasp, their lack of experi
ence brought what looks like ultimate
defeat.
It was Officer Nolan who narrated the
Incident yesterday to Police Judge Mo
gan, before whom Edward Herbert, a
colored waiter at the Midway, was
charged with selling liquor without a
licenss. Nolan testified that he and
Sullivan, both attired a la Reuben-In
town, visited the Midway last Wednes
day evening, and their disguise and de
meanor so completely deceived the
ever-suspicious attaches of the place
that they were asked if they would not
like to be introduced to some of the
actresses. A few momÂ«nts later they
were comfortably seated in a curtained
recess with two blonde ladies who car
ried weight for age and were of free
and easy manners.
"I'll push the button, kid, and you'll
pay for the drinks," one of the flaxen
haired artistes Ingenuously remarked
to Nolan, and of course there was no
demurrer to the suggestion. The but
ton was tmshed and Edward Herbert
responded in person. The ladies hinted
at champagne, but the gentlemen deft
ly sidestepped the hint and ordered a
bottle of beer. Herbert brought the
beverage and four glasses~and received
from Xolan the sum of one dollar, law
ful money of the United States, in pay
ment of the tipple. So far the running
had been ridiculously easy, and it is
safe to say that a veteran ln Nolan's
r'ace would have won the remainder
of the race in a canter. But that young
man committed the fatal blunder of
neglecting: to obtain positive proof that
the liquid in the bottle was lager beer.
He did not even taste it, ungallantly
refusing to sip from the glass held to
his lips by the fair hand of the fat
test cf the blondes.
"Why didn't you taste it?" inquired
the attorney for the defense.
"Because." was the answer, "I never
tasted intoxicating liquor In my lifp."
Instant commotion ln court. All eyes
focused upon witness, who receives
quiet reminder from bench that he is
on oath. Bailiff Hickey rubs his ears
vigorously. Bailiff Mahoney's gavel
quells general murmur of incredulity.
Clerk Grey swings around his chair and
stares open-mouthed at man on stand.
"Do â youâ meanâ toâ tellâ me," said
the astounded lawyer, "that â you â
never â tasted â liquor â and â you â aâpo
liceman?"
"That's what I said," replied Nolan.
"Remember he's a young policeman,",
remarked the Judge.
"I accept his statement as a confes
picn of extreme youth," said the at
torney.
It was their newness as policemen
that obtained for G. Sullivan and H.
Nolan the delicate task of ascertain
ing whether there was truth ln the re
port that liquor was being retailed in
the unlicensed Midway Plaisance. They
were young and unsophisticated In ap
pearance and the shrewd Chief con
cluded that if they failed to find evi
dence sufficient to procure conviction
he might as well give up the quest
as hopeless^ For some of his sharpest
men had been outwitted by the vigilant
Midway management. Their best dis
guises had been penetrated at a glance
and untold gold could not have bought
for them an alcoholic stimulant in that
temple of Orpheus and tome other
muses.

SUMMARY.
Ham Iberg pitched a ball that barely
wobbled up to the plate, yet the slug
gers with the exception of Frisk could
not hit it. Frisk's double in the first
inning gave Seattle three runs. Al
though Portland had already scored
four on five hits in the first, it looked
easy for Seattle with her batting array.
However, in the remaining eight in
nings not a man got near the home
plate. In order to win the Portland
fielders had to do some sensational
work. In the eighth inning Raymond,
Nadeau and Drennan cut off hits.
Blankenship made two wonderful
stops in the ninth. Score:
Seattleâ i Portlandâ

TACOMA, July 14.â Tacoma won
out in the ninth inning of a superb
game to-day, when the visitors went to
pieces and allowed the Tigers to score
without a hit, Newton's error giving
Doyle a life. Flood's error in covering
first for a bunt advanced him to sec
ond, Nordyke's out put him on third,
whence he scored with ease when Ea
gan drove a hot one at Toman, who
fumbled the ball and couldn't pick it
up in time to nail any of the runners.
Keefe and Newton pitched grand ball
from start to finish and, considering
the rain, their support was good.
Bcore:
Seven spirited rounds were boxed by
Eddie Hanlon at his training gymna
sium in Alameda yesterday afternoon.
He exchanged punches with Mike
Synfy for six minutes, took on Toby
Irwin for two periods and mixed gloves
Â¦with Joe Angeli for three rounds. Eddie
exhibited a noticeable increase in the
speed of his hand and foot work and it
was evident that he has profited as a
result of the short and rapid bouts he
participated in with the short distance
fighters of the Eastern States.
Prior to putting on the mitts Hanlon
walloped his new fangled punching bag
for twenty minutes, skipped the rope
for a quarter of an hour and wrestle"d
with his training, mates. He also en
joyed the pleasure of a plunge in the
bay and took part in a baseball game.
During his roadwork Eddie has be
come somewhat sunburned and in do
ing his first boxing yesterday he lost
considerable loose cuticle from the
bridge of his nose through that organ
coming in contact with his opponents'
gloves. He will therefore eliminate
boxing for a few days until he has
grown a new supply of skin and recov
ered from the effects of the sun's rays.
To-day he will go through the usual
routine with the exception of donning
the mitts.
Toby Irwin and Joe Angeli, who are
fitting themselves for ring battles, are
rounding to form nicely and could step
into the arena now if required.
Yesterday was a - busy day for Bat
tling Nelson. He was up with the
larks and took a ten-mile spin around
San Quentin Point, accompanied by
Trainer Murphy, Dave Barry, Frank
Newhouse. "Smiling" Metzner and
Frank Rafael. The afternoon was de
voted to boxing, wrestling, bag punch
ing and skipping the rope.
Trainer Murphy is confident that
Nelson will best Hanlon and wishes the
fight was to occur on the 19th Instead
of the 29th.
A good one on Nelson leaked out to
day. The boys were invited by the
prison officials to visit the prison and
all accepted the kind invitation. They
found San Quentin a very interesting
place, but all preferred Metzner's tav
ern when it came to a boarding-house.
On the way out Nelson stopped to
pick a bouquet for himself and became
separated from the rest of the boys.
He became bewildered and wandered
around the institution like a lost child
until missed by Ted Murphy, who sent
a guard to find him. Nelson says it
will be many a day before he visits
San Quentin again.
The hills of Sonoma and Lake
counties will In all probability be prom
ising fields for deer hunters this season.
The game wardens have heen keeping
a strict watch and the violators of the
law have been severely dealt with. ThÂ«>
country is rather wild and accommo
dations are not the best, but those who
are willing to put up with a little in
convenience should be well rewarded.
Reports from Summit indicate that
the deer field is better there than It
has been for several years. The big fel
lows have been seen in numbers and
everything points to a successful
season. There are no doves in the im
mediate vicinity.
In Yolo County deer are very scarce
and the sportsmen In general will be
disappointed to hear this. Doves, how
ever, are plentiful and good bagg may
be secured. The same may be said of
Tehama, though it is expected that
deer will be more plentiful there a lit
tle later on.
Reports received from Stirling City,
in Butte County, announce that the
sport is good in that vicinity. The
hunting in and around Bradley Is not
so good as was expected, few deer as
yet being sighted in the hills.
Crow's Landing promises to be Â¦ thÂ«
gathering place of large bands of
hunters. The deer are plentiful there,
and those who are prepared for a rough
time in the mountains may expect to
do well. El Dorado County will not
yield much game this season. The hunt
ing is also poor about Folsom.
Morgan Hill reports lots of deer ia
the mountains. The country In that
neighborhood is easily traversed, and
hunters can find ample accommoda
tions. It is necessary to secure permits
to hunt there, but these can be easily
had from the owners of the land-
The deer season opens to-day, and
sportsmen in every part of the State
are making ready to give the antlered
beauties a hot reception. From ac
counts, the big game is to be found in
plenty in the mountains all over the
State. Mary large parties of sportsmen
have already departed or are about to
leave for the various scenes of action
and will be heard from shortly.
Deer abounds in large quantities* In
the Castella district In the Upper Sac
ramento Valley, ilany sportsmen have
been attracted by the alluring stories
from there, a'nd it is expected that it
will be a popular resort for heavily
armed citizens.

SUMMARY,
But It was not so, for San Francisco
did the noble in its half of the same
round. With Hildebrand on second
and Aleany on third, Irwin came along
with a royal two-cushion shot out to
left, bringing them both in and mak
ing it a deadlock again.
Oakland made a good getaway in the
ninth ! when Schmidt hit and Kruger
was safe on Jones' fumble. It was
victory for a hit. but Dunleavy biffed
three times at the azure blue and
Schlafley popped to- short.
Hildebrand opened up the ninth for
San Francisco -a'ith a double away out
to deep center. Meany sent him around
to third on an out and Irwin bunted.
Hilde fairly flew to the plate before
the ball was fielded and then it was
really all over for the day. The score:

Oakland got In wrong In the first
round. After two had been knocked
down. Meany singled to center and Ir
win poppÂ«d up a high fly to left. Both
Mctkiir.an and Dunleavy offlcad up to
the ball, but neglected to get it, so
Measy scored and Irwin perched on
eecond. Then Cy Townsend swung
through with a zinger to right and Ir
win trotted in.
Oakland went them one better In the
third when Kruger walRed and stole
and Dunleavy, Moskiman and Streib
each kicked back with hits, making
three runs in all. A bad throw by An
dersen started the rally and Oakland
kept very busy while it lasted. In the
seventh the commuters copped another
and victory seemingly belonged to
them. t
The knowing fans had a hunch that
there would be doings before the game
yesterday afttrnoon waa finished.
Uncle's 6tÂ«rÂ» were landing mighty hard
on thÂ« ones tossed up by Mr. Schmidt,
but for a long time they could not
bunch 'em right- In the -seventh, horv
ever, they tied up the score and the
ninth brought them victory. Score,
Â£an Francisco 5, Oakland 4.
Schmidt was about as easy to hit
yesterday as a big man when mixed
np in a barroom rough-house. But for
a long time he took the beating with
a deal of grace, for his team was play
ing some good baseball behind him and
he feared not. But when it came time
for Oakland to win the game they
were not there. It was ready to be dÂ»
livered to them in the ninth, round, but
r.o oce had the purchasing price, name
ly, a base hit.

Vcrn Tromp, who won the first in a
common canter, is by Ben Brush out
of Cinderella, mare by Hermit. He had
a very ordinary two-year-old to beat
to-day, the only winners being Dul
cibella and Escutcheon. Almost from
start to finish It was seen that Von
Tromp had merely to stand up to win,
which he did by a long distance.
A few days ago In the presence of
eight thousand persons, a- fair pro
portion of whom knew within a short
time the Identity of the colt, Sysonby,
by Melton out of Optlme, waa worked
between races five furlongs in 1:01. In
the sixth race to-day this colt made
his first appearance. He was opposed
by ten others, none of them able to
make him extend himself. He, like
Von Tromp, was also an odds-on fav
orite. In the first quarter of the mile
he had all his opponents beaten and,
coming away in the last quarter like
a four-mile horse, won with wonderful
ease.

CHICAGO. July 14.â Bear Catcher
went down to defeat In the third and
feature race of the Harlem card of
seven races to-day. The California
colt, which won hia last time out,
heavily played, had his usual strong
following to-day and was a close sec
ond choice in the betting at 6 to 2. He
shot away from his field at the start
and his backers were encouraged, but
after going six furlongs he quit badly
and was next to last at the wire in a
field of six.
Phil Finch, closing favorite at 6 to 5,
backed down from 2 to 1, proved easily
best. Jockey Knapp evidently knew
the early pace would be a hot one and
so he dodged It, allowing Bear Catcher
and Emperor of India to run their
heads off.
The mile was run in 1:40 1-5, which
is the fastest niile made at the meet
ing. The track was fast, weather clear
and warm and a good card offered.
Six favorites won and the talent gave
the bookmakers a severe drubbing.

The Vice President is 43 years old
and entered upon his official duties a
year ago. It is the first political posi
tion he has held and he was selected
for it owing to his well-known ability
as a financier and his loyalty to Presi
dent Escalon. During his stay in the
Hast Valedo expects to call on Presi
dent Roosevelt and convey to him the
respects of President Escalon of Sal
vador. A needed rest after many
years' attention to business affairs is
the main reason of Valedo's visit to
this country.
Calixto Valedo, Vice President of the
republic of Salvador, arrived from
Central America yesterday and is reg
istered at the Occidental. Accompanied
by his brother George, he has come to
the United States for the first time on
a pleasure trip, which will include a
month's stay in San Francisco, a visit
to the St. Louis exposition and a tour
of the Eastern cities. Senor Valedo is
one of the most prominent financiers of
Central America, having been connect
ed with the banking institutions of
Salvador for twenty odd years. He 13
at present general manager of the
Banco Salvadoreno and is a large
holder in coffee fincas.
Although occupying the second high
est position within the gift of the peo
ple of Salvador, Valedo makes no claim
to being a politician and in fact he
stated yesterday that he has taken no
interest in the politics of his country
further than ,for the welfare of the
republic. Regarding the conditions
there, he said:
The republic of Salvador has never been in a
better condition than at the present time.
President EÂ«calon is a peaceful man and his
administration has emphasized this fact. The
people have abandoned their revolutionary Ideas
and the fact has materially advanced the pros
perity of the country. The coffee crop is an
exceptionally good one this season, and this,
with the Increased exports of Indigo, sugar,
balsam, hides, feathers and cocoa, has greatly
encouraged the people. To-day Salvador Is the
richest and undoubtedly the strongest of the
Central American republics and Â» Is rapidly
adopting foreign methods which will further
her Industrial and commercial Interests.

sponse to a petition for better fire pro
tection in the district that the Board
of Works has an appropriation of
$15,000 for the repair of buildings,
part of which may be used for the

the ground that concrete -would not

At â¢ the hour of adjournment attor
neys for the defense announced that
the defendant will take the stand this
morning and all evidence wjll be in by
noon.
Frank S. Mitchell, formerly bookkeep
er for the Eppingers and at present
assistant to Receiver Wadsworth, was
called and testified as to various par
cels of property possessed by the firm
in April, 1903. He knew of their lo
cation and area, but could not approxi
mate the total value. Â¦ The business of
the firm averaged about $10,000,000 a.
year and between the months of Oc
tober, 1902, and April, 1903, It had re
duced its indebtedness on bills pay
able about $500,000. During the five
years prior to June 1, 1903, about $500,
000 was paid to various banks in in
terest.
Dr. Whitney was called, but was not
permitted to testify as to the present
physical condition of the patient.
Josua Eppinger testified that on April
14, 1903, the assets of the firm were
$1,200,000. He visited the International
Bank on April 10 and had a conver
sation with Colonel Beck regarding
loans which he afterward related to
Bernard Ettlinger In the presence of
Joseph Eppinger.
Among the witnesses who testified
to Jacob Eppinger's good reputation in
the business community were Julius
Kahn, William Greer Harrison, Henry
Wangenheim and Chacles S. Lau
meister.
"I am not sure of all I said to By
ington," answered Langton, who was
momentarily becoming more nervous,
"but I did tell him that I did not want
to testify against Jacob Eppinger.**
"How long did you work for Ep
pinger?" asked Dunne.
The witness was so overcome with
emotion at the mention of the name
of his employer, or for some other
cause, that he was unable to respond,
and in a soothing voice as a mother
would "coo" to her baby Dunne in
formed the witness that he would not
urge an answer and Langton left the
stand in a lachrymose condition.
"That sneer ill-becomes your face,"
retorted Byington, "but I do not vouch
for the character of this or any other
witness. If he were the greatest rogue
in the State I would put him on the
stand and reserve the right to impeach
him afterward. When we put this man
on the stand his mind was a blank.
Now you call him and he can testify
fr^el>."
At this point Judge Lawlor intervened
and told the witness he must answer
the question.
WITNESS IN TEARS.
"1 &m District Attorney for this city,"
rep'.:ed Byington hotly, "and as such
I need none of your advice in your
puffed-up egotistical manner."
â¢Ycu District Attorney! District At
torney!" ejaculated Dunne. "You are
attorney for Colonel Beck and the
banks."
"'Did you not," aeked Attorney By
fngton. "tell me in my office that Jacob
Eppinger was the . head of the firm,
that he attended to the financial end
of the business and that you did not
want to testifv against Jacob Ep
pinger?"
Attorney Dunne was on his feet in
an instant, not only with an. objection
to the question, but with a bitter at
t&d. on the District Attorney, who he
said was guily both of misconduct and
"of most outrageous conduct toward
the v.itnes5, when he should be acting
as miich as attorney for the defense as
for the State."
Calvin Langton then took the stand
and was again shown the cargo in
voice book. On cross-examination he
testified tjiat none of it was in his
handwriting, and that he had read
from it as from a newspaper without
positive knowledge as to the au
thenticity of its contents. He could
identify signatures but could not tell
from the invoices who had sold the
wheat. '
ATTORNEYS AT ODDS.
A wordy war between District Attor
ney Byington and Attorney Peter F.
Dunne for the defense was among the
chief features of the Eppinger trial yes
terday. As a sequel to the quarrel,
Calvin Langton, who had been em
ployed by the Eppingers for years, left
the witness stand with swollen face
and tears streaming from his eyes.
Jacob Eppinger, it is announced, will
take the stand to-day, and if he is all
that the numerous character witnesses
summoned yesterday say he is will
surely come out with flying colors. His
condition just before adjournment in
dicated that he was on the verge o?
another of his spasms or "spells."
Aside from showing the reputation
of the defendant for truth, honor and
honesty, the defense again devoted con
siderable time yesterday to showing the
magnitude of the business carried on
by the firm and its assets at the time
the loan with the International Bank
ing Corrwration was negotiated.
Charles Schirmer, former Assessor of
Solano County, was recalled to the
btand yesterday morning and question
ed as to the value of property on Ryer
Island. His information, being based
on hearsay, was rather indefinite. He
testified that he had assessed the Dixon
property at $12,000, but knew positively
that the original cost of the buildings
Â«n it was In excess of that amount.

The following were referred to the
Assessor for further investigation:
After being called to order, It was de
cided that the board simply hear the
reason given by the applicants for as
sessment reductions and then refer the
allegations to the Assessor In case he
should wish to investigate them: By
go doing the board has postponed many
cases until the Assessor has had time
to investigate them and they will have
to come up before the board at a later
time for final adjustment. In cases
where the Assessor was possessed of
the facts the board complied with his
recommendations and either denied the
application or reduced the assessment.
The board adjourned to meet this af
ternoon at 2:30.
The reductions decided upon by the
board yesterday are as follows:
B'nai-B'rith Association, one lot on Eddy
street, from $12,000 to *75OO; Pacific .Coast
Steamship Company, from flOO.OOO to $20,000.
The following applications for reduc
tion of assessment were denied:
The Board of Supervisors met yester
day afternoon at 2:30 o'clock as a Board
of Equalization to hear the reason for
reduction of alleged excessive assess
ments.

Session of Court Enlivened
by a Wordy War Between
the Opposing Lawyers
At the afternoon session White, call
ed by the defense, said that he had
been at the Nevada Stable only once
during the 6trike, but admitted that he
had been to c-ther stables as many as
a dozen times.
Proprietor E. G. Pierce and his
â¢watchman, J. E. Miller, were recalled
to identify White as the man who had
been particularly offensive in his re
marks regarding Miller, whom he call
ed an ex-convict. Both said that at the
time White wore a mustache. He ap
peared in court smooth shaven.
In the meantime Judge Maguire and
his clients admitted that all of the men
named were members of the union, but
when Van Ness came to offer the
records of the Police Court to prove
their criminal acts Judge Hunt ruled
out the evidence on Judge Maguire's
objection that the acts referred to had
nothing to do with the matters com
plained of by the proprietor of the Ne
vada Stable.
It was Van Xpfs' intention to prove
that Lurkhardt, the "red-headed man"
referred to as particularly obstreperous
amon? the pickets, "Kid" Egan, con
victed of assault, George Burrows, ar
rested for malicious mischief, and
William Bowen. arrested for disturb
ance of the peace, were members of the
union. Their names were not on the
list which White had in court and it
was decided to subpena Financial Sec
retary Sheehan in order to examine
the roll.
Is next to the barn, told of things he
irad observed in the conduct of the
}>ick<-ts and the crowd which gathered
on the sidewalk.
IN1OX SECRETARV TESTIFIES.
Tom White, secretary nf the Stable
men'c Union and employed in the city
Fire Department, said that his union
v as Incorporated "under the laws of
th? American Federation c-f Labor."
In accordance with the demands of his
EUbpena he had brought the union rec
ords and after a wordy battle between
thr attorneys for both sides he was
Â«-rd*>red to give the dates of various
ur.i.m meÂ«tinps. Attorney Van Ness
'.'culled that Monroe, captain of pick
ed, had testified that White had been
notified by the union to "keep out"
of slugging: affairs and the attorney
expressed a desire to prove that the
union had never taken any action in
puch a case or in any other where
members were guilty of assault <rr dis
turbance.
White admitted on the stand that the
records contained no reference to any
action against the members mentioned.
Van Ness called upon him to produce
tt list of the members of the unions.
White said he had only a list of mem
bers and officers numbering fifty,
whereas the membership of the union
numbered 600.
WANTS MORE EVIDENCE.
At tbe morning session A. Rulfs,
v host r'.aco of business adjoins the
Nevada Stable, corroborated the testi
mony of othT witnesses as to the acts
<_.? the pickets. Charles Matthias, who
v ?s frequently in the neighborhood of
the stable, told a like story, and John
Dcianey, a. ralot-n-kecper, whose place
Af far as the hearing of evidence is
concerned, the test case involving the
rights of unions to boycott 'unfair"
employers is ended and next Wednes
day morning Superior Judpre Hunt
v.ill hear the arguments on the merits
ci the case of Pierce against the
Stablemen's Union, which has been in
court for eereral days j>ast. Mr. Van
>:<..--s, representing Pierce and the Clti
r as' Alliance, rested his case at noon
yesterday and Judge Maguire an
nounced that he would make a motion
iii 2 o'clock for a rK.-r.suit. It was ex
pected That Masuire would argue the
motion and set forth the union's side
<jf !he ca?<\ but he did not do so and
the court immediately denied the mo
tion.

The United States transport Thomas
arrived yesterday from Manila, via Na
gasaki and Honolulu. She Is 29 days
from Manila, 22 from Nagasaki and 8
from Honolulu. The full passenger
list numbers nearly 1000 persons. In
cluding 1 160 in the cabin and 825 enlisted
men. The last are as follows: Compa
nies 10, 38, 85 and 108 of the Coast Ar- '
tillery, 304 men; casuals, 367; discharg
ed soldiers and employes, 123; general
prisoners, 25. One insane man. Captain
J. D. Cook, a former shipmaster, from
Honolulu, came up in care of an at
tendant and will be taken to the Ma
rine Hospital. Major General McKay
Williamson, depot quartermaster at
Honolulu, reports here for new orders.
Frederick W. Unger, a war correspond
ent, Is returning from Korea after the
usual troubles with the military offi
cials and press censors. P. G. McDon
nell, member of the City Council of
Manila and correspondent of the New
York Sun; C. F. Stone, editor of the
Manila Times; Dr. and Mrs. H. A. Eb
berly and daughter of Jolo; the Rev. F.
M. Price and wife from Guam; Chief
Engineer D. D. Wilson of the United
States ship Pompey; Brigadier General
and Mrs. P. M. Coxe from Honolulu;
Lieutenant Colonel C. H. Lauchhelmer
of the United States Marine Corps, and
the family of Judge F. N. Powell of
the Manila civil government, with
about thirty commissioned officers,
were among the passengers.
Frederick W. Unger, the home-com
ing newspaper man, echoed the plaint
of all the returning war correspond
ents. He was unable to get near the
firing line and was only permitted to
view the progress of the war from a
long distance. The top of his head is
shaved in the Chinese style." This is a
feature of the disguise he adopted in
'his attempts to get into the zone of
conflict. He says he joined the Hung
Hutsus, or Red-Haired Bandits, who
are Chinese -irregulars now in the Jap
anese service. He drifted around
awhile with these fierce barbarians, but
his companions never seemed anxious
to get within lancing distance of the
equally fierce Cossacks. When he
heard that Etzel, another correspond
ent, had been killed by the Chinese
soldiers, he decided to get back to civ
ilization and severed his connection
with his red-haired friends.
A story was started on the Thomas
that throws a shade of doubt over the
Hung Hutsus part of the narrative.
According to this story no Chinese
bandit ever saw Mr. Unger's head
shaved, but the trick was done by the
transport's barber after he had come
aboard. Passengers also declare, that
Unger intends to lecture in connection
with his coming book on the situation
in the Far East. The passengers re
peated the tale under their breaths fore
and aft, but Unger laughed at the re
port and dubbed it nonsense.
When he boarded the Thomas at Ma
nila he found no accommodations for
extra passengers and took up his quar
i ters in a large stateroom which had
I one occupant. Soon after entering the
; door was locked and he learned that he
was fastened in with Captain J. D.
Cook, a violently Insane man. Unger
was badly frightened when he was re
leased next morning. Somebody had
told the attendant that Unger was
crazy also and must be watched con
| stantly.
I The Rev. F. M. Price, from Guam,
gives a few interesting items concern
ing that mid-ocean station. The isl
and's population numbers about 10,000,
! of whom 1300 are children between the
ages of 5 and 13. The crying' need of
the island is education. There are no
schools and the Gpvernment appears to
be lax in providing these for its child
wards. Under the Spanish rule the peo
ple were always illiterate and Uncle
â¢Sam seems to have done nothing Jo
change that condition.
An important discovery has come out
from the East. Surgeon H. A. Ebberly,
stationed on the island of Jolo, has
found the cause of the spread of
dengue, the malarial fever of the Phil
ippines. It is simply the mosquitoâ the
same noxious insect that has been
found to be the spreader of yellow fe
ver in Cuba. The doctor has prepared
I and forwarded a voluminous report of
his important discovery to the surgeon
general in Washington.

It Is frequently the case that a party wishes
to sell his holdings for the purpose of reinvest-
ing the proceeds in a different kind of property.
Our long experience in this business enables
us to often accomplish this double purpose by
only one transaction. The only condition we
make is that your property. If you wish us to
dispose of it for you. MUST BE GOOD OF ITS
KIND AND IN A GOOD LOCATION. Dcn't
take up either our time or your own with
worthless offerings, or property so heavily
mortgaged as to leave no actual equity.
If it has merit, whether you own real estate
or a mercantile or manufacturing business,
bring a description of same to our office, stat-
ing what kind of property you prefer in ex-
change, and you will be surprised how quickly
we can effect the result.
THIS IS SIMPLY BECAUSE WE UNDER-
STAND THE EXCHANGE BUSINESS and are
the only company in San Francisco making a
specialty of same. We make no charge for ad-
vertising or any other purpose unless we pro-
euro an exchange satisfactory to you to ac-
cept.

REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS.
OAKLAND, July 14.â Charles Gow
ard pleaded guilty in the Police Court
to-day to charges of embezzlement and
defrauding an innkeeper. Fred Omo,
a collector, said Goward had Btolen
money from him, and F. A. Wright,
landlord of the Brunswick House,
complained that the prisoner had
failed to pay his bill there. Sentence
was deferred, as the police desire to
investigate a charge that Goward had
been twice dishonorably discharged
from the United States army for deser
tion.

COMMERCIAL NEWS
WASHINGTON, July 14.â It is ' ex
plained here that the excitement
among the business men of Panama
over the recent establishment of. ports
of entry at Ancon and Cristobal, in the
canal zone, is based on a misunder
standing of the intention of the Canal
Commission. The French company, in
constructing the canal, dredged a
deep-water channel to the mouth of
the Rio Grande River and erected
wharves at La Boca. This channel was
deep enough to enable sea-going craft
to discharge their cargoes at the La
Boca wharves. The waters of the har
bor adjacent to the city of Panama are
shallow, and it is necessary to lighter
goods which are landed at the wharf
in the city of Panama.
The merchants of Panama, it is be
lieved here, think the establishment of
the port of Ancon, which is the new
name given by the commission to La
Boca, will prevent the continued use
of the channel and the wharves at IÂ«a
Boca for the landing of goods intended
for the city of Panama. These diffi
culties can be avoided by an amicable
arrangement in respect to transporta
tion of goods landed at La Boca for
Panama under bond.
The best anchorage for vessels in
tended to discharge goods to Panama
is in the vicinity of the islands ceded
to the United States by the canal zone
treaty, and the merchants at Panama
possibly fear that they will be deprived
of the privilege of utilizing such
anchorage, or, if their vessels are per
mitted to anchor in these waters, that
harbor fees, wharfage, etc., will be
charged. These, however, are matters
of detail, susceptible to adjustment
on terms expected to prove satisfactory
to all parties.
Assurances Are Given That
Uncle Sam Intends to Ar
range Satisfactory System
MOTIVE MISUNDERSTOOD
Mcrcliants Are Apprehensive
That Establishment of New
Port Will Be Detrimental
PANAMA'S FEAR
IS GROUNDLESS

NEW YORK. Ju.y 14.â To-day's stock mar
ket was similar to yesterday's market to the
extent that strength an<3 weakness were dis
cernible in it. Â»ide by side, profit-taking" in one
quarter being offset by new advances in an
other. Hut the reactionary note was rather
more dominant than yesterday, and the later
market failed to reypend In the same way to
the t-fforts to effect a comprehensive rally.
This was partly because the traders who rought
the advance were more cautious than yesterday
in putting out fhort lines, the forced covering
of which was an important factor in the late
rally. The volume of dealings to-day was
much less than yesterday. The market was
fctill one of a great deal of animation and
breadth and good absorptive power for the
large offerings to take profits when they were
thrown upon It. Probably the most potent fac
tcr in the reaction was the absence of a de
cision on the Northern Securities distribution
case. The adjournment for another week of
the annual meeting of the Northern Pacific
stockholders indicates that their previous ad
journment until to-day was not with definite
knowledge of the decision, as was assumed yes
terday. Pome incongruity was recognized In
the simultaneous upward movement of Union
Pacific, and the Northern Securities which oc
curred yesterday on the rumor of this decision,
which must necessarily be to the advantage or
one party and at the cost of the ether. The
speculative nature of yesterday's movement In
those stocks thus strongly pointed ta ihe in
creased disposition to sell them and take profits.
A bluet pronouncement from the president of
the Northern Securities Company of skepticism
of the Oovemmenfe wheat crop as far too lib
eral and a frai.k admission from the president
of the Atchlson of the serious damage to the
crop wrought by the rain caused more serious
attention to be given to that question than
yesterday. The violent rise In the wheat mar
ket was an additional warning, and the Gov
ernment on the condition cf the foreign crops '
(Sid not reveal the amount of damage there
that has b*en held to account for the recent
strength in our wheat market. On the other
hand, the more favcrab'.e condition of the cot
ton crop and the renewed foreign demand for
that staple proved of some benefit to the cot
ton carrier*, notably Louisville and Nashville
and Southern Railway.
These stocks shared with Reading Amal
gamated Copper and People's Gas the role of
sustaining points in the market. The ajvances
were not accounted for by any specific news
and th?y were net strong enough to hold the
market, which sold to the lowest point of the
day in the final hour. The reported prospect
of a settlement of the meat packers' strike was
Snored as much as the initiation cf the strike
The market' closed irregular and slightly above
the lowest.
The bond market was firm. Total sales nar
value. $2,790,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on call.

CHICAGO, July 14. â Weather and crop news
were of an almost sensational character and
short sellers concluded there was little mercy
for them in the conditions developed by the
renewed rains and were desperate buyers.
Old July wheatâ the fancy dealâ which closed
on Wednesday's advance at 95Vic, opened to
day at UTJaWT^e arid moved up to 98}Â«c, 3c
higher. New July sold at 'J5VjÂ®9ti%c to first
trtidera and went to 'J~*ie. For the new
September the big speculative position, the
price started at ST^fcS-Sc and the top was
SS'/sC a shade less than l^ic over the close
last night. Then followed a .period of heavy
tiroflt-takin;;, realizing sales by all classes of
longs. Prices had a quick backnet and the
break of the market in thirty minutes was
9S*4c to 97c for the old July and from 8SHc
to fcTVic for the new September. December's
price, after lc advance to S"c. reacted to
SCHc One of the principal factors in the.
advance was the official report of Secretary
Coliurn of the Kansas Bureau. It declares
that long-continued rains have made It Im
possible to save the Kansas wheat in mer
chantable condition. A Kansas City authority
pieced the damage to the winter wheat har
vests since July 1 at 50,000,000 bushels. From
Nebraska most serious claims were made of
rust and blight. The Ptate bulletin put the
yield at 30 per cent of average crop. Liver
pool was ?sÂ®Wi higher. English country
markets were up Â»>d to Is and very strong.
Mills were reported as buying wheat at $1
a bushel in Tennpf3ee. July prices held pant
of the 3c advance, resting at 97c old ana
90 Vie new. New Septemlxr, after a rally from
Hb%c to 87%n In the lust hour, settled back
at the close at SC%@SÂ«Â»ic, or *4c under last
ni^ht.
Strength in wheat brought out a good de
mand for corn. September starting with a
gain or #<c@Uc at -W%<i}W%c. With the
break in wheat corn declined to 48*ic. The
close showed a slight improvement, although
but a trifle above the bottom, at 48%c.
Oat* was firm at the outset, inspired by
the bullish action of wheat, with September
up U@%c. A steady decline was scored, final
trade being at the lowest point for the day,
82 U6.
Â¦Weakness In provisions was due to lack of
support. Interests that have been credited
with bulling the market sold generously In
prospects of a settlement of the stock yards
strikes. September pork closed 22 He oft at
$12 fi'Va. Lard was down 12V4c; ribs showed
a net loss of 10c.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ It was a holiday at Paris. Fu
tures at Liverpool ' were higher.
Chicago advanced l%c, but fell' back again.
The Southwest- were large buyers and Wall
street was also buying.
The Chicago letter of Mitchell, Mulcahy &
Co. said: "Further unsettled weather
throughout the West and Northwest and a
rather encouraging advance I in foreign mar
kets caused an opening sharply higher here.
The advance met with heavy realizing sales
and a good part of the improvement in July
was lost and all of the Improvement in the
more distant futures. The incentive to the
selling was a better weather â¢ map on pros
pective better weather being /generally preÂ»
dieted throughout the entire West. The PrlcÂ«
Current as usual estimates less damage than j
other authorities, putting it at 20.000,000 to
25.COO.00O. There is no change in the cash
situation. It is all a question of amount of
movement from first hands In the Immediate
future. The July option in this market is
rapidly being liquidated, although the existing
Interest is still enough to make the local sit
uation uncertain. North western advices con- J
tinue on the whole favorable. We . are not
bearish on wheat, but with favorable weathtr |
in prospect we are Inclined to think we |
would look at it a minute and Â«ee If we
could not buy It cheaper."
This market continues firm, both here and
In the Interior, with futures higher, and the
shippers in the market. A good deal of Wheat
is now going from the San Joaquin Valley ,
to Los Angeles for milling and poultry feed. \
Country holders are not sellers at present, as
many of the farmers have light crope and j
are holding for more money, J

Changes in miscellaneous vegetables were
â¢ slight and supplies of raw kind* still In
' excess of the demand. Receipts ot tSreen Corn
included much poor stock, which dragged badly
at the minimum quotations and. as usual large
lines of Summer Squash and Â¦ Cucumbers had

The fruit market was quite active during the
early trade, as in addition to the regular local
demand there was a steady call for top quality
stock for shipment on the Puget Sound steam
er. Nearly all kinds. of small tree fruits were
wanted for export, but Apricots in crate* and
fine well-colored Apples packed in 4-tler
boxes were the firmest descriptions. Occa
sional sales of Gravenstein Apples were re
ported at $1 75 per box. but for the general
run of shipping stock. $1 50 was about the top.
Plums and Prunes were abundant and only
fine shipping stock brought 75c per crate. 60o
being about tha highest figure paid by local
buyers. . Peaches, particularly the Hale's
Early variety, were still in excessive supply
and weak, although the low prices stimulated
trade. Figs continued to advance under lim
ited supplies and a fair demand. Part let t
il'ears sold at a wide range aa to quality and
the best offerings were readily disposed of at
full figures. All klnda of Melons were plenti
ful. A carload of Watermelons came in from
Bakersfield and sold at the same prices es
tablished for the Freeno article on the pre
ceding day. Cantaloupes appeared from the
river and were held' at $4 per crate. The pre-*
vious low prices seemed to have stimulated
the demand for Berries and prices were higher
all around. Currants "too. were higher under
a brisk demand and light arrivals. Huckle
berries from Sonoma were offering again and
met with prompt saJe at 15c per pound. Prices
of Citrus and Tropical fruits were without
quotable change.

LOCAL MARKETS;
The local market continues dull and un- 1
changed. Chicago was somewhat lower on the
day. Wires from there report that no scarcity
on account of the strike Is apprehended at
present, as there is quite an accumulation of
stock, the supply of Hog products at the five
leading packing centers of thÂ« Went being
25, 000. COO lbs more than a year ago and 50.* |
000.000 lbs more than two years ago. This is
exclusive of Pork and Lard. In fact. th<%
packen say that the strike N a good thing In
one way, , as it enables them to work off
large holdings of old stock canned and cured
Meats. Thin may explain their action in an
nouncing that they would not make any stren- :
uous attempt to continue operations at once.
â¢ The Chicago letter of Mitchell. Mulcahy &
Co. says: "Market heavy. There Is little '.
question that there has been liquidation on an .
extensive scale by those whose buying was ,
most instrumental in bringing about the ad
vance of the past month. Scattered outside
buying on the strike has probably absorbed j
most of the offerings. The prospect at the
moment seems favorable for an early settle- i
ment of the strike. There Is a fair demand for
meat?. We nee very little in these conditions
to maintain an advancing market."

One of these. Just received. 1* to the effect |
that the crop in the State of Washington will
probably amount to something over 40,000
bales with favorable weather. In Oregon the
yield- has been cut down somewhat and the
100,000 bales formerly expected is considered
DO longer possible. 90.000 probably coming !
nearer to the mark. In California about 55,
000 bales will be produced. It Is estimated
that stocks In grower*' hands are not over 350 ,
balea, Washington growers being cleaned out.
In dealers' hands there are about 5500 bales. ,
while last year at this time there were 21.000
bales left on the coast.

Heacock yesterday - Thomas Price,

deposition in the case of the United
States I of America against the Moun
tain Copper Company, Limited, at Kes
wlck.
. The suit was brought to enloln the
company from allowing sulphurous
fumes to escape from its smelters and
thereby destroy the vegetation in the
vicinity. Mr. Price testified that all
vegetation within a radius of four
miles had been destroyed .and that
orchards within twenty miles had been
Injuriously affected. The. suit will
probably be dismissed, as the copper
company has purchased twenty-five
acres of land on the water front near
Martinez and will remove its works
there. A system for converting the
noxious fumes into sulphuric acid will
be installed so that no complaint may
arise. ' .

A suit attacking the will of Mrs.
Sophie Luhrmann, who died on June
30 last, leaving an estate valued at
$40,000, will be filed to-day by Minnie
Luhrmann. the adopted daughter of
the deceased, who claims she was un
justly disinherited by her foster
mother. The action will develop some
interesting details of the dead woman's
career, for it appears that she had
been n^arried three times and that her
last matrimonial venture was with
Bernard Luhrmann, who, /although
joining in the suit with the adopted
daughter, is Indirectly accused of hav
ing married his wife for her money.
Mrs. Luhrmann was 70 years of age
when she married Luhrman, who^was
then only 35. Nearly eighteen years
ago the woman offered a home and her
protection to Minnie Batlomaer, then
only a year old, and continued to pro
vide for the child up to a few months
before her death. In 1893 Mrs. Luhr
mann, who was then the widow of a
man named Koster, from whom she
had inherited quite an estate, married
Bernard Luhrmann and shortly after
her marriage she conveyed to her hus
band half of her property. Four years
later the wife and her husband for
mally adopted Minnie Batlomaer and
the latter continued to live with them
as their child.
A few weeks before Mrs. Luhrmann
died the daughter went tÂ» Sacramento
on a visit and during her absence, as
it afterward developed, the mother
visited a local legal firm and had her
will executed. In whlchshe bequeathed
her estate to her collateral kin, among
them a brother, Henry Louis Maas,
and several relatives in Germany, and
named Frederick C. Slebe her execu
tor. The attorney employed to draw
up the will received no Intimation from
his client that she had an adopted
daughter and the question Is yet to
be settled as to whether the mother
purposely concealed the truth, or, in
absent-mindedness," forgot the fact.
In the complaint to be filed to-day
by Thomas E. Curran, attorney for the
daughter, the omission of any refer
ence to the daughter in the will Is
chosen as the basis of the suit, in
which it is also alleged Henry
Louis .Maas, the brother of the de
ceased, exercised an undue influence
over his sister, when her mind was
weak, and continually tried to Impress
her with the Idea that Bernard Luhr
mann simply married her for her
money and that the adopted daughter
had left her for good and entertained
no filial spirit toward her protector.

Mrs. Lulirmann Neglects to
Provide for Her Adopted
Daughter, Who Will Sue
The girl dressed herself neatly 'and
spent some time arranging her wealth
of dark brown hair. She walked brisk
ly from the door of her brother's house,
turning back once to - jest with Mrs.
Gerson, who -had many misgivings
about letting her. go' out alone. Though
Miss Gerson seemed, merry, she had
Miss Gerson was a very pretty bru
nette. She was a German Jewess and
had lived In this city only two
years. About bIx weeks ago she be
came seriously ill and relatives sent
her to the German Hospital.
She returned to the residence of her
brother, Samuel Gerson, at 912 Steiner
street, last Tuesday, apparently cheer
ful 'and restored to health. She talk
ed like one in the best of spirits and
In reply to her brother's suggestion
that she go to the country she main
tained that she was entirely cured.
Yesterday morning she informed her
Elster-in-Iaw, Mrs. Samuel Gerson, that
she was going for a walk. Alarmed
at her Ions absence Mrs. Gerson tele
phoned to police headquarters In the
afternoon. She was told that the body
of a young woman who answered Miss
Gerson's descriDtion was at the
Morgue. Samuel Gerson went to the
Coroner's office and learned that his
wife's fears were only too well founded.
From a fragment of a label on the
bottle that contained the poison Cor
oner's Deputy Brown was certain that
the stun! was purchased at the drug
store of Charles J. Abraham, at Mc-
Allister and Fillmore streets. Abraham
denies that he has sold any carbolic
acid In five years. Late yesterday even
ing Mrs. Gerson remembered that she
had purchased the poison from Abra
ham about a week ago.
Indications are that Miss Gerson con
templated suicide for several days.
She set about it deliberately and en
deavored throughout to conceal her
identity.
Despondent because of a long illness,
Clara Gerson, aged 22 years, drained
the contents of a phial of carbolic acid
In Golden Gate Park yesterday morn-
Ing. She died five minutes later.
H. Wigger, a gardener, heard the
girl's dying cry and. saw her fall to
the ground. Â¦ Policeman "Williams ar
rived in response to the shouts and
summoned the Park Hospital ambu
lance, but the girl was beyond any
help. Her fair face was distorted and
burned and her big brown eyes were
glassy in death.
"When Samuel Gerson arrived at the
Morguk and identified the body of the
suicideVas that of his pretty sister he
was overcome by grief. It was some
time before he or his wife could give
a lucid account of the girl or explain
motives that might have led to her
death.
Miss Gerson herself took all precau
tions to avoid publicity. She left no
letters, and before she quitted her
brother's house she destroyed all photo
graphs of herself that were in the place.
When the girl first came from Ger
many she worked a few weeks in her
brother's notion store, the firm name of
which Is . Gerson , & Baer. Dr.
Krotoszyner, who attended her while
she was at. the German Hospital, says
that she suffered intensely from ner
,vous trouble.
The morning was clear and all the
world seemed pleasant to this girl, who
was beautiful and had many friends
and loving relatives. But she shud
dered as she thought of the shadow of
life suffering that hung over her. She
could not live under it. After a last
look at the blue sky and the green
trees she closed her eyes and raised
the bottle of acid to her lips. She
sprang to her feet with a pitiful moan,
then fell to the ground writhing in
agony.
Out in the park she walked
to the wooded knoll opposite the
Cyclers' Rest. There she sat for a
short time on a bench, weighing the
problem between a life shattered by
illness and a aulck death. The doctor
had said that she might recover or
that she might become a chronic in

said.

poison and was fully resolved to end

for Miss Barrymore and surrounded
her with an excellent cast.

ROSE COGITLAX TO STAR
IX VAUDEVILLE SUNDAY
Ever since the death of her husband
and a daughter several years ago Mrs.
Garrlty had been demented and be
came addicted to the Inordinate use of
alcoholic drinks. It was feared by
her relatives that she would die In a
fainting spell brought on by a weak
heart.
She was last seen alive at a quarter
after 9 o'clock last night by Charles
Bayley Jr., a druggist, whose place of
business is at the junction of Eddy
and Scott streets. Bayley Informed
the police yesterday that at that hour
Mrs. Garrity gave him a promissory
note for $25, signed by Manuel M.
Stolz, as security for payment for a
bottle of liquor, which she took away
with her.
An autopsy was made yesterday by
Morgue Surgeon Bacigalupl upon the
body of Mrs. H. M. Garrlty, who was
found dying at 1 o'clock yesterday
morning by Special Officer Helbush on
the sidewalk at the intersection of Lo
cust and Clay streets. A fractured
skull was found to have been the
cause of death. The decedent was af
fected also with cirrhosis of the liver
and heart disease caused by alcohol
ism.
When the unconscious body of the
woman was found on the sidewalk it
was believed by the police that she
had been the victim of a footpad.
That her death was the result of an
accident her relatives later made clear
to .the colice.
She had been residing with her
married daughter, Mrs. Kane, at 414
LJocust street, and had been subject to
fainting spalls. In one of these fits
about four months ago the unfortun
ate woman fell off a couch to the floor
and broke her collar bone and three
ribs. ' "Â»
JudgÂ© Graham, who is acting as Pre
siding Judge of the Superior Court,
yesterday ruled against W. A. Samuel,
& well-to-do butcher, who sued for
<ilvÂ©rce against his wife, Catherine.
His Honor stated very plainly that he
believed Samuel's evidence regarding
their property rights and other things
was false. A cross-complaint filed by
the wife denied his allegations and ac
cused him of consorting with other
jmomtax.
Ths Judge took advantage of the op
portunity to render a pointed written
opinion in which he deplored the flood
of divorce suits now pouring* into the
courts and he said that the "interlocu
tory decree" measure, the constitu
tionality of which has been recently
maintained. Instead of decreasing the
divorces had served to increase them.
He suggested that the next Legislature
should pass laws which would further
restrict the grounds upon which a di
vorce may be obtained.
A divorce was granted yesterday to
!Ajdelaide W. Walden from Charles J.
Waiden on the ground of desertion.
The derelict husband is supposed to be
In Mexico or Central America. The
case recalls an old scandal at San
Quentin prison, where, for many years,
"Walden was bookkeeper. He disap
peared, leaving a large shortage In his
accounts.
Among yesterday's 6ults for divorce
that of Josephine Schneider against
Emile S. Schneider afforded interest In
that sh 1 ; charged him with "beating,
bruising and wounding her and threat
ening to kill her." On April 23 last be
is said to have "viciously held a- loaded
pistol to her breast."
Judge Graham granted a divorce to
Mao* Stange from Walter Stange on
the ground of extreme cruelty, some of
the specifications being that Stange
told her he loved another girl, threw
his wife against the door, injuring her
ehoulder and drew a revolver on her.
Suits for divorce were filed by Sam
uel O'Toole against Belle O'Toole, de
sertion; Gustave H. Beisel against
Catherine Beisel, desertion; G. G. Ken
nedy.against H. E. Kennedy, desertion,
and Anna E. Fleischer against Herman
Fleischer, neglect.
Judge Troutt granted a divorce to
Minnie L.. Roy from Charles G. Roy on
the N grounds of Intemperance and
neglect and to William H. Gibson from
Sarah K. Gibson for desertion. Judge
Graham granted divorces to Salome
Wagner from Eugene Wagner for ex
treme cruelty and to Julius Souza
from Violet Souza on a cross-complaint
alleging infidelity.
"Wilson's friends say there was no
reason why the man should have left
home, as his property would more than
cover hi3 indebtedness. He was a mem
ber of the Engineers' Union' in good
standing and that organization has
taken urÂ» the search since the matter
was reported to the police.
A week ago the property occupied by
Ringholm Brothers was on fire. The
matter was reported to Fire Marshal
Towe and an indirect charge made that
Mrs. Wilson had attempted to burn
the building. The story was Investi
gated by the Fire, Marshal and found
to be without foundation. The police
have found no trace of the missing
man.
Clarence "Wilson, whose home was at
1655 Forty-eighth avenue, has be"en
missing since June 1. Hla wife has
been compelled to break up housekeep
ing and take up her residence with a
sister. at 22 Moss street. In order that
she and her 2-year-old child may have
shelter. She is without means of sup
port.
For over six years "Wilson was the
engineer "at the Poodle Dog restaurant
and was known as a sober and saving
man. Some time ago he began invest
ing in Richmond property and erected
three houses, one of which he sold early
In* the year. In May^he sold the prop
erty adjoining his residence to Ring
holm\Brothers. the butchers. That
property included a butcher shop. The
payments were to be made from the
receipts of the shop each week. Ring
holm Brothers say they paid Wilson $40
In cash the day before he disappeared.
That statement Mrs. Wilson denies and
has asked to see the receipt. Mrs. Wil
son says her .husband had. only $15
or $20 Â¦when he left home at 6 o'clock
in the morning of June 1, and she
can think of no reason for his failing
to return unless he has met with foul
play.
On May 9 he was to have given An
tonio B. Blanco, the proprietor of the
Poodle Dog, a mortgage signed by
Wilson and his wife, but the paper was
never signed. Wilson had borrowed
about $1600 from Blanco and had used
the money In building. The mortgage
was to have been security for that
amount.

Â¦ Mrs. Elizabeth H. Thompson,!
of Lillydale, N.Y., Grand Worthy
Wise Templar, and Member of
W.C.T.U., tells how she recov-
ered by the use of Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound.
"Dear Mrs. Pixkham: â I am one
of the many of your grateful friends
who have been cured through the use
of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound, and who can to-day
thank yoa for the fine health I cnioy.
When I was thirty-fire years old, I
suffered severe backache and frequent
bearing-down pains ; in fact, I had
womb trouble. I was very anxious to
get well, and reading of the cures your
Compound had made, I decided to try
it. I took only six bottles.but it built me
up andcured me entirely of my troubles.
"My family and relatives were
naturally as gratified as I was. My
niece had heart trouble and nervous
prostration, and was considered incur-
able.. She took your Vegetable Com-
pound and it cured her in a short time,
and she became well and strong, and
her home to her great joy and her hus-
band's delight was blessed with a baby.
I know of a number of others who
have been cured of different kinds of
female trouble, and am satisfied that
your Compound is the best medicine
for sick women."â Mrs. Elizabeth H.
Thompson, Box 105, Lillydale, N.Y.â
