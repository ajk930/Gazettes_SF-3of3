Mannino, the son of James Mannirio

fact that Sbarbaro had been threat

by the same band.
Unless the money is carried to a lone

"The Five Skeletons have decided to

in the letter. "You must have heard
of many violent deaths among your

PORTLAND, Aug. 21.â Members of
the American Mining Congress and
delegates from throughout the United
States arrived on every train to-day
and representatives from Canada and
Mexico are among those expected to
night to attend the seventh annual ses
sion of the organization which com
mences here to-morrow morning.
Sentiment strongly favorable to con
tinuing President Richards at the head
of the congress for another term is
expressed and his re-election is a strong
probability. Convention politics, how
ever, center chiefly about the contest
between Denver and Salt Lake City
for permanent headquarters, though
there is . considerable interest in the
selection of the convention city for the
next annual meeting of the . congress,
for which El Paso. . Tex., is a strong
candidate.

Gates took a special train, with de
tectives, captured Jester and placed
him in the Rulls County Jail, where, in
July. 1900, after a four weeks' sensa
tional trial, he was acquitted, owing
to the absence of a cprpus delecti case.
Forty-eight hours after his acquittal
he practically admitted to a newspaper
man his guilt, but a pledge was exact
ed that the story would not be related
until Jester's death. Â£â¢'Â£!Â¦
On his deathbed, it is claimed, he
admitted having killed Gates by. cutting
his throat and sinking the body in Bee

CARBONDALE, III., Aug. 21. â The
great mystery which for thirty years
has surrounded the murder of John W.
dates" brother, Gilbert, haa been
cleared, and Alexander Jester has con
fessed to the murder.
Gates was' killed in Hulanis lane, in
Andrain County, Missouri, in January,
1871. He was traveling overland with
Jester, the latter exhibiting in every
town a trained buffalo calf. Jester was
captured in Kansas by Azel A. Gates,
John W. Gates' father, a few weeks
afterward, with Gilbert's belongings,
including team, clothes and watch. He
was taken to Mexico, Mo., -and shortly
afterward escaped from jail and was
not found until twenty-seven years
later, when his sister, Mrs. Cornelia
Street, divulged to John W. Gates his
whereabouts.

SANTA CRUZ. Aug. 21.*-Unless all
signs fail. Gavin McNab's influence will
dominate the convention. Upon the
McNab slate for chairman is written
the name of Isidore Dockweiler of Los
Angeles. The followers of James H.
O'Brien's "Horse and Cart" brigade
talk of putting forth Ed White, brother
of the late Stephen M. "White, as the
'exponent of the Hearst faction of the
party for chairman, but the leading
Democrats say that the use of White's
name in this connection is unauthor
ized. The victory of the "organiza
tion" over the O'Brien forces at the
San Francisco primary election is ac
cepted by. many of the interior Demo
crats as the finish of Hearst so far
as prestige in the councils of the Dem
ocratic party of the State is concerned.
It is said by the party leaders that

to retire from the field as a candidate
for chairman of the convention. Early
to-morrow morning Isidore Dockweiler
and White will hold a 'conference.
White promises to come early and in
spect the olive branch. Inland Demo
crats, who are weary of the party
strife in San Francisco, assert that
peace must prevail some time, and now
is the accepted time. But Gavin Me-'
Nab, leader of the "organization," and
Jim O'Brien, commander of the "Horse
and Carts," are here, and each is ready
for a scrap.
The convention of 730 delegates will
be called to order by Timothy Spellacy,
chairman of the State Central Com
mittee, at 2 p. m. There will be some
proxies from districts where the
primary election law does not apply,
but not a great number. It is gossip
to-night that the convention will nom
inate a candidate for Associate Justice
of the Supreme Court and will also
adopt resolutions favoring the creation
of a court of appeals.
A resolution favoring the proposition
to issue $2,000,000 of bonds to extend the
San Francisco seawall will be present
ed. It is expected that the convention
will lend its approval, aa the money to
meet the interest and principal- of the
bonds must be paid from tolls collected
by the State Board of Harbor Commis

WASHINGTON, D. C. Aug. 21.â
Press dispatches from Shanghai stating
that the United States torpedo-boat de
stroyer Chauntey had placed itself be
tween the Russian cruiser Askold and
a Japanese destroyer which came into
the harbor cleared for action arouse
the greatest Interest here. No official
advices have been received here, how
ever, rgarding this or the consular
meeting supposed to have been called
by Goodnow, the American Consul
General, to 'consider the situation cre
ated by the inability of the Chinese
authorities to compel the Russian war
ships either to disarm or to leave the
harbor.
The fact that the Standard Oil Com
pany has called upon Goodnow to pro
tect its interests is regarded as most
significant. It indicates that this com
pany fears the inability of the Chinese
authorities. It ie expected that an ap
plication " will be received by the State
Department to-morrow from the Stand
ard Oil Company for the protection of
its interests if the reports from Shang
hai are true.
The report that the Chauncey inter
posed itself between the Japanese de
stroyer and the Askold is taken as an
indication that Rear Admiral Stirling,
commanding the American fleet in
Asiatic waters, is prepared to oppose
any violation of the neutrality of
Shanghai, which has so lonÂ«Mjieen re
garded afe an international-. Tport that
the Japanese did not attack '.it; or at
tempt to attack It In- the war with
China ten years ago. It 'is, however,
stated here that no instructions have
been sent to Rear Admiral Stirling,
but that he is left to employ his own
discretion.
SURPRISE IN LONDON.
Action of the American Naval Com
mander Unexpected.
LONDON. Aug. 22.â The intervention
of the American squadron at Shanghai
in the Japanese operations against the
Russian cruiser Askold created consid
erable surprise in official and diplo
matic circles here. The Japanese lega
tion was at first inclined ' to believe
that the report that the United
States torpedo-boat destroyer Chaun
cey steamed into a position
between the Japanese" torpedo boat
and the Russian cruiser was a
"Shanghai fake," as it had understood
that the American Governmnet would
not object to offensive action against
Russian warships in case of their fail
ure to observe Chinese neutrality. An
official of the legation said:
"If the report Is not untrue the
American commander must have had
good reason for his action, such as the
protection of American Interests, which
would have been endangered by flying
shells.
"Japan has been very reluctant to
send ships into the. harbor, for she rec
ognized the international character of
Shanghai. The laws of neuWality de
manded that China should order the
Askold and the Grozovoi to dismantle
or leave, port and, China having given
the order and the Russian ships hav
ing refused, it was then incumbent for
Japan to act, thereby protecting Chi
nese neutrality and at the same time
exerting her rights as a belligerent. It
would never have done to permit' Rus
sian ships to remain. in a Chinese port,
deliberately and avowedly violating
the neutrality of the country.
"Whatever reason actuated the Amer
ican commander, if he really did as, is
reported, it is certain that no complica
tions will follow." >
It is believed at, the Japanese,lega
tion that if the American commander
intervened to preserve Chinese i neu
trality the American Government will
take measures to enforce it.
The Foreign Office asserted at the
time of the arrival of the Askold and
Grozovoi at Shanghai that it was not
the business of Great Britain to inter
fere, but that it was China's duty to
observe strict neutrality, and it has
gone so far as to urge her to adopt
this policy. In the opinion of British
officials, if .the Russian ships fail to
dismantle they mjist take the , conse
quences. At the same time innocents
cannot be permitted to suffer results
of misdirected fire in case of a battle,
and it lÂ» said that the British Con
sul General probably .will be instruct
ed to support the American Consul
General in urgent representations to
the Taotai that he shall take measures
to compel respect for China's neutrality
to compel respect for China's neu
trality.
GARRISON'S CHIEF REPORTS.

ST. PETERSBURG,. Aug. 21. â Em
peror Nicholas has received the fol
lowing message from Lieutenant Gen
eral Stoessel, commander of the mili
tary forces at Port Arthur, dated
August 16: .<
"The Japanese made a two days'
attack on our position on the Uglo

their attacks were repulsed. The
Uglovaia, -Visokaia and Divlsionaia
mountains remain in our hands," \ The
enemy's losses were very great. ..

ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 22, 4:50 a.
m.â Trie latest reports 'from Port Ar
thur Indicate that the garrison there is
holding out with wonderful tenacity in
the face of persistent desperate as
saults, .The. only question is how long
any body of troops can withstand such
awful punishment and whether the
garrison in the fortress can outlast the
Japanese ammunition and men. '
The report that thirty regiments have
been drawn from General Oku to
strengthen the attackers is believed to
indicate that the Japanese- southern
army is in desperate straits, and seems
to show that the Japanese have not
enough men to prosecute .simultaneous
campaigns of great magnitude in the
north and south. ;
The report that the Novik has been
sunk has not. yet been published here.
If It is true it will be greatly felt, for
the .gallant cruiser, which has been fre
quently mentioned in dispatches, has
endeared herself to the whole nation
by her tireless activity at Port Arthur
and it has been greatly hoped that she
would reach Vladivostok in safety.
The action of the Japanese Govern
ment in regard to China caused increas
ing uneasiness here. While it is be
lieved that the. dictatorial attitude as
sumed by Japan was adopted largely
for its moral influence upon the-Chi
nese, it is also taken to indicate that
Japan plans' to make herself the dom
inant influence in the Celestial Empire.

he would be powerless to protect them.
< CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo., Aug. 21.â
No secret is made here of the fact that
the deportation of Attorneys Eugene
Engley, Frank J. Hangs and J. C. Cole
and twelve other men from this district
last night was planned by members of
the Mine Owners' Association and Cit
izens' Alliance, and was carried out
under their direction. The El Paso,
Indicator, Findley and other large mines
were closed down when the day shift
stopped work and the miners 6t^ both
day and night shifts were requested
to assemble in Cripple Creek, as trouble
was brewing. A report had been in
circulation that several hundred de
ported union men were returning to
the camp in a body and it had been
determined to drive them away again,
should they come. This report proved
to be groundless. However, other work
had been laid out for the 2000 or more
miners \ who swarmed into town and
acting under orders given by leading
citizens they proceeded to "round up"
the Federation attorneys, employes of
the Inter- Mountain Mercantile Com
pany's store and others who have open
ly expressed sympathy with the "West
ern Federation of Miners, and escort
them beyond the city limits.
During the entire proceedings the
Sheriff of Teller County and the Mayor
and Cfty Marshal of Cripple Creek were
out of town. Under Sheriff L. F. Par
sons and Deputy Thomas Underwood
attempted to control the mob, but were
easily overpowered. Many of the depu
ties who have been regularly employed
in the district since the riots early in
June, it is alleged, were active as lead
ers of the mob.

CHEFU, Atig.^22. noon.â The first
detailed news of the general assault on
Port Arthur indicates that a tremen
dous conflict is waging and that Victory
is hanging in the balance.
Chinese who left Port .Arthur yester
day and arrived here to-day state that
the Japanese, by making desperate
charges, which were reinforced by an
artillery fire from Shushiyen and
Louisa Bay, swept from the north into
the Pigeon Bay territory and drove the
Russians back from the main forts.
The ground being comparatively flat
in this vicinity, the Japanese were un
able to hold it in the face of the Rus
sian artillery fire and they retired
northward, an eighth of a mile beyond
the zone of fire.
The Chinese declare that the Japan
ese captured one important fort located
on the Itzshan hills, midway between
the west seacoast and the railway.-'on
a line drawn approximately from a
point Â¦ midway between Pigeon and
Louisa bays.

TSINGCHOU, Aug. 21. â Major
Hoffman, the German military attache
at Port Arthur, who left the Russian
fortress upon the order of the Ger
man Emperor, arrived here yesterday
on the Japanese cruiser Yaeyama.
Major Hoffman left on the 18th,
having obtained permission from the
Russian and Japanese authorities.
When ten miles out from Port Arthur
he was taken off his junk by Japan
ese torpedo-boat number 49, which
subsequently put him on board the
Yaeyama. On the morning of the
10th the major called upon the com
mander of the Japanese cruiser Nis
shin. Admiral Togo is on board the
battleship Mikasa. He is in good
health. The Yaeyama was ordered to
take Major Hoffman to Tsingchou.
His baggage, including his papers,
was left by mistake on board the junk
upon which the German officer left
Port Arthur. This junk is expected
to reach Chefu soon.
Major Hoffman says the Japanese
treated him with every courtesy.

TAOTAI IS POWERLESS.
The Taotai has notified Ameri
can Consul General Goodnow,
who is deau of the Consular body,
that China cannot protect the for
eign settlements. He contends
that Russia ignores the orders
issued bv China and that China
has no means of making her obey
them.
The Askold is docked adjacent
to the warehouses here of the
Standard Oil Company, which are
valued at more than $1,000,000.
The Standard Oil Company has
demanded protection for its prop
erty from Consul Goodnow.
The dock where the Askold lies
is owned by British interests. On
one side of this dock is German
and Dutch property and on the
other side American property.
There are eight American, one
German, two British and four
French warships here.
TOKIO. Aug. M. â After a severe en
gagement with the protected cruisers
Chitose and Tsushima, the greyhounds
of the Japanese navy, the lleet Rus
sian: cruiser Novik has been van
quished. The light occurred to-day.
Afti-r it the Xovik. in a sinking condi
tion, was run ashore in Korsakovsk
: harbor, on the island of iSaghalien.
The full details of this sea fight are :
not known here, but it is evident that
the ChitOsC and Tsushima caught up
with the Xovik yesterday and that a ;
running fight ensued* The contest was
rt sumed and terminated early this ,
morning. Captain SukeichJro Taka- ,
li.-i.shi. who is In command of the
Chitose, reports the engagement in a.
brief telegram which reached the Navy
Department here this afternoon. He!
Bays he first attacked the Russian
cruiser on Saturday afternoon and that
on Bcnday morning he inflicted heavy
damage upon her. The Xovik nearly
tank, but she wa% beached at Kor
; sakovsk. A shell from the Xovik
struck Tsushima in a bunker. Tem
porary repairs, however, rendered the
Japanese cruiser seaworthy and she
continued to tight. The Japanese suf
li'red no casualties.
The imperial Prince Yorihito of the
House of Higashi-Fushimi is second in
command on board the Chitose. Cap-
I t;iin Sento commanded' the Tsushima,
The fate of the crew of the Xovik is
not known, but it is believed they
abandoned their vessel and landed at
Kors-akovsk.
It is generally thought here that the I
Chitose and Tsushima steamed in close
to the Xovik early this morning and
.completed the destruction commenced
yesterday. It is expected that a de
tailed report of the occurrence from
the commander of the Chitose will be
received to-morrow. This report is
anxiously awaited.
The news of the destruction of the
Xovik has b^en received in a curious
manner by the Japanese public. From
a practical standpoint it is highly
satisfactory, for the Xovik could have
been most dangerous as a commerce
.destroyer, but. considering the matter
from a sentimental standpoint, much
.regret is expressed at her loss. The {
I^ovik has been splendidly handled and i
bravely fought throughout the war
Â»nd J&r>ani?se naval officers and the
public generally have frequently ex-
I ressed admiration for the cruiser, her
commander and her crevÂ»\
The Xovik was one of the Russian
f.eet that steamed out from Port Ar
thur on the morning of. August 10 to
furce its way through the Japanese
lines. She entered Tsingchou on the
night of Augutrt 11, but got away from
there on the night of August 12, hav
ing remained less than twenty-four
hours. She was then erroneously re
ported to have been sunk forty miles
from Tsingchou.
The Xovik wns next reported head
ing for Van Dieman Strait, at the
Fouthern end of Japan, evidently In an
effort to reach Vladivostok, via the
eastern coast of the Japanese islands.
Yesterday it was reported from St.
Petersburg that the Xovik had reached
Korsajtovek- From the fact that the
-Jr.panese cruisers met the NOvik off
the southern end of Saghallen it would
appear that the Russian cruiser had
passed through the Kurile Islands and
v as endeavoring to reach Vladivostok
by way of La Perouse Strait, avoiding
the passage of the Tsugaru Strait,
which was used by the Russian Vladi
vostok squadron when it raided the
eastern coast of Japan.

CHEFU; Aug. 21. â With the ex
ception of Chinese vessels, the United
States cruiser Cincinnati ' and the
United States gunboat Frolic are the
only warships at present in this port.
They are ready to send men on shore
at a moment's notice should occasion
arise. The fear of trouble, however,
is remote. There Is some fear that the
local Japanese may clash with the
Russian sailors front the torpedo-boat
destroyer Ryeshitelni. who are now
at the Russian Consulate.
The foreign Consuls and others in
authority were interviewed to-day on
the question of possible trouble and
all united in saying that nothing had
occurred so far to give reason to ex
pect a clash. The situation is tran
quil.
Japanese Not to Attack Kuropatkin's

MUKDEN. Aug. 21.â The belief Is in
creasing here. that the Japanese do not
intend to make a direct attack on Gen
eral Kuropatkin's position at Liaoyang.
The movements of the Japanese and
other information indicate that they
will try rather to force an engagement
in the vicinity of Mukden.
The rains have not damaged the rail
way, but have destroyed a number of
bridges.
A small fight occurred on August 19
on the Motlen Pass road seven miles
east of Liaoyang, but its results were
unimportant.
As the rains have rendered the lower
grounds impassable, the main Japanese
army has fallen back to the hills.

SHANGHAI, Aug. 22.â A long meet
ing of the consular body Â¦was held to
day for the purpose of discussing the
case of the Russian cruiser Askold and
the destroyer Grozovoi, which put into
this port on August 12.
No decision was reached, but it is be
lieved that the final action will be the
same as that taken in the case of the
Russian gunboat Mandjur, which put
into this port and which was compelled
to dismantle on March 31. The con
sular body will meet again this after
noon.
The Japanese torpedo-boat .destroyer
which entered the harbor yesterday
has left the harbor with dispatches for

Failure
To cure indigestion is largely due to the
old theory that when the stomach b#Â»-
comes inactive it nÂ«Â»eds somethnlg to
mechanically digest its contents, and ca-
thart'Ics. purgatives, ete.. are used, which
give onlj temporary relief, because they
digest by irritating the lining of the
stomach.
Modern science recognizes the fact
that it is the nerves that furnishes mo-
tive power to digest the contents of the
stomach.
The nerves agitate and mix the food,
and stimulate the secretions. When they
become weakened they lack energy, and
indigestion, dyspepsia, sour stomach re-
sult.

MUST NOMINATE.
Congressional district con
ventions will be held before the dele
gates now assembling take their de
parture from Santa Cruz. Nominations
xsust be made to preserve the party
Â° organization, but the hope of success
Rt the polls Is very slender. Here Is
the accepted programme for Congress:
* First District, A. Camlnetti of Ama
dor; Second District, Theodore Bell of
Napa.; Third District, George E. Faw of
Alamfeda; Fourth District, E. J. Liver
c r.ash of Â£an Francisco: Fifth District,
"William J. Wynn of San Francisco;
Sixth District, William M. Conley of
Madera; Seventh District, William O.
Morton of Los Angeles; Eighth Dis
trict, William E. Srnythe of San Diego.
There is no certainty that Camlnetti
will accept, but he is regarded as the
. <*nly one in the Democratic camp who
ran -make the campaign in the First
District Interesting for J. N. Gillette,
the accepted Republican nominee.
Word comes from the south that
Smythe will not accept the Democratic
nomination in the Eighth. In the event
nl -his final declination Senator E. J.
Emmons may be put in the race. In
The Third District Warren English or
.A. F. Ft. Sure mav go upon the re-
Vised slate. The organization hopes
that Faw will accept. D. M. Delmas
is not here as a politician. He remarks
that law business accounts for his
T*resence in Santa Cruz at this, time.
â¢ WILL TALK OX HARMONY.
W. S. Kellingsworth has been agreed
â¢upon by the delegates of Napa and So
. lano counties to represent them in the
S*-i.ate. Jt is said, however, that he is
not anxious to receive the nomination
end may refuse. Should this con
tingency arise no nomination for Sena
tor from that district will be made
here.
Timothy Spellacy. chairman of the
Siate Central Committee, will not
make an extended speech when the
< invention opens to-morrow, but what
he does say will be to the point and
the point will be harmony. .SpeJlacy
orfl] refer to the late unpleasantness in
t$Â£ State convention that grew out of
tht- Presidential aspirations of W. R,
Hearst and to the still continuing un
pltasantness in San Francisco that
grew out of the same condition. He
will urge that personal enmity be for
pctten and that the success of the
party in the coming Presidential cam
paign be the object for which all shall
strive. And. says Epellacy, if his voice
has not failed when this harmony talk
has been concluded, he will proceed to
inform the San Francisco delegates
that It is the sense of the interior that
hereafter the spleen of the San Fran
ciscans must be vented In places other
than the floor of the State conven
tions. Factional rows, he Fays, that
inVolve the patronage of only one City
Hall must not jeopardize the Interests
of the entire State party and that
hereafter the interior will see that this
principle is adhered to.
. The Democrats in camp were rein
forced to-night by the arrival of J. C.
Sims and Curtis Hlllyer of San Fran
cisco, J. F. Coonan of Humboldt, De
witt Clary of Stockton, C. O. Dunbar
of Sonoma, J. B. Sanford of Mendocino,
Judge Kirby and S. Mahon of Yuba,
*Ju<iÂ£-e M. T. Dooling of San Benito, E.
I. Woodman of Sacramento and John
M. Griffin of Madera.
W. O. Morton, who will be nominated
by the Democrats to represent the Sev
enth District In Congress, Is a well
fcnown lawyer of Los Angeles. He pur
poses challenging Congressman Mc-
JLachlan, who is a Republican, to pub
lic debate during the campaign.
Monterey, San Benito and San Luis
Oblspo counties have decided to nom
inate Ross Sargeant of Monterey for
the Senate.
â¢ DOCKWOLER IS SANGUINE.
"My election to the chair to-morrow
eetfiys assured," said Isidore Dockweller
to-night. "A careful canvas of the sit
uation shows that not only hare I the
0 solid votÂ» of the counties south of Te
hachapl. but the following counties will
Â° throw their entire strength to me: Del
Norte, Humboldt, Lake, Sonoma,
ShRsta., Trinity, Modoc, Tehama, Butte,
"Olean. Nevada, Placer, El Dorado,
Tuolumne, San Joaquin, Madera, Tu
lare. Kings, Fresno, Kern, San Luis
pblspo. Contra Costa, Colusa, Napa
and Inyo. In addition to these counties
I have a majority, I am told, of the
' delegations from Siskiyou, Monterey,
- Santa. Clara, Solano and Mendoclno and
twenty-Sve majority In the San Fran
cisco delegation. We have half of Ala
nieda; Marin and Amador are divided
and Alpine, Plumas and Calaveras are
â¢yet to be heard from.
-* "So far as any speech I may make
to-morrow Is concerned, it is a ques
tion. I have given it but little thought.
Once I rehearsed a speech â¢ I contem
plated making as chairman of a con
vention, and while on my way to the
hall I was called off for the cake of
barmony. Since then I have made my
speeches extemporaneously. I do not
contemplate giving way to any one else
in thÂ« present case, but the lesson of
tfcft old day remains and I have quit
rehearsing." <
Judge M. T. Dooling of San Benito
will' be nominated by the Democratic
ocpventlon for Associate Justice of the
Supreme Court. Under the law the
term of Justice Lorrigan, who was ap
pointed by Governor Gage to succeed
the late Jackson Ter^ple, expires at the
coming general election, this being the
JSret general election since the death
of Justice Temple. Judge Dooling was
prominent in the last Democratic con
vention held in this city. As a member
of the committee on platform and reso
lutions he aided In framing the plat
form and was commended for his many
sound ruggestlons.

COLORADO SPRINGSr Colo., Aug.
21. â A special to the Gazette from
Cripple Creek says: Upon hearing a
report that a mob was being organized
In Victor for the purpose of marching
to Hollywood and lynching four men
who were reported to be there, Sheriff
Bell to-day, with five deputies, went to
Victor, where he found a big crowd on
the streets. The Sheriff left two depu
ties in Victor and with the two other
officers started for Hollywood, where
he found Robert Murphy, two brothers
named-Grant and a man named Nichols
barricaded In their houses. The latter
three declared they were British sub
jects.
Sheriff Bell says that the men were
heavily armed and their houses stocked
with ammunition. The men, accord-
Ing to Sheriff Bell, said they had come
there to fight and would fight After
much persuasion the Sheriff induced
the. men 'to leave the district and left
deputies to protect them until the even
ing train left, for Canyon City. The
men were allowed to take their guns
and ammunition with them.
Sheriff Bell says he Is convinced that
had the four men not left the district
there would have been a great loss of
life.
Sheriff Induces Intended Victims to
Leave the District.

LONDON. Aug. 22.â The Constanti
nople correspondent of the Standard
considers that the diplomatic triumph
of the United States in the matter of
that Government's demands upon Tur
key rests upon a slender foundation.
The correspondent adds that the coun
cil of Ministers thrice recommended
yielding to the American demand, but
that the Sultan absolutely declined to
agree to this step. This attitude Is em
phasized, says the correspondent, by
the fact that the Sultan did not receivo
Minister Leishman in audience after
Friday's selamlik, as It had been ex
pected he would.
It is considered improbable that the
Porte will reply to the Minister's note,
and therefore the question Is looked
upon as shelved pending the execution
of the process of recognition, when. It Is
considered not improbable, fresh diffi
culties will arise.
CONSTANTINOPLE. Aug. 21.â A
note from American Minister Leish
man, dated August IS, was handed to
the Turkish authorities within twelve
hours after the receipt by the Minister
of the Turkish note on Monday. In this
note Leishman holds the Government
to its solemn undertaking, coming di
rect from the Sultan, respecting equal
treatment with other nations for the
United States concerning the question
of educational institutions.
This allusion to the imperial pledss
apparently embarrassed the Porte,
which had previously announced that
it would ignore the formal verbal as
surances which Minister Leishman de
clared he had received.
If there be any complaint coming at
the Orpheum's bill this week it" is not
on the variety score. Let us see. There
is concert singing by the Heinrichs and
other singing by. Little and Pritzkow;
the Barretts juggle and Guyer and
O'Neil dance, Kelly monologues and
Trelour muscles, and Eva Williams and
Jac Tucker and Eraraett Devoy and
his people furnish Imitations and at
least one of the best sketches- seen on
O'Farrell street lately. You pays your
money and takes your choice.
The Heinrichs are good enough for
me. I don't know of any man I would
rather see behind a closed Stelnway
than Max Heinrichs â particularly when
his mouth is open. His accompani
ments impress one as newly delightful
every time he Is heard. -They are as fit
as watermelon on a hot day â one 'of
those we are expecting.' You feel as
though he were playing just to you
something charming that he had just
thought of. And when to the crisp,
tender stuff his fingers are turning out
so easily he adds his songâ as easy and
tender â one is greatly grateful. Last
night Mr. Heinrichs sang the Schumann
"Grenadiers," and though perhaps with
out the fieri' climax he gave it in
earlier years, yet all the pathetic charm
was there. Nor was it too fine for the
Orpheumites, who are beginning to be
acclimatized to good singing. Talking
of climate. It would have been kinder
of the management to stop the smok
ing during the Heinrichs numbers.
Kippered air is uncanny for vocalists.
I am sure Miss Julia Heinrichs felt
the effects of it. Miss Heinrichs has
gained considerably in poise and also
in maturity of voice since she was last
heard here. But the voice sounded a
little befogged, tired, particularly at
first. However Denza's "May Morning?'
was given with all the unaffected grace
and refreshing simplicity of the con
tralto's earlier work and with a notable
gain in vocal depth. A lighter number
â about a "twinkle In his eye" â showed
the young singer in lighter mood and
as concluding number father and
daughter gave the Goring Thomas duet,
"Night Hymn at Sea."

William Gillette's civil war drama,
"Held by the Enemy," In spite of old
age and constant wear from end to
end of the continent, was given an
ovation yesterday afternoon and even
ing at the Grand Opera House.
James Neill ; and his talented com
pany -were quite at home in the Gillette
play and curtain calls were frequent
and tears were copious at those points
which appeal to the sympathies, and
ringing applause followed the heroics,
while laughter came to the wiry and
persistent war correspondent. Bean, to
whom falls the light, flippant and
breezy lines and some good business.
All the plaudits Neill got were well
deserved. Edythe Chapman, Francis
Slosson and Lillian Andrews, Rachel
McCreery, Susan McCreery and Eu
phemia McCreery, respectively, also
well merited the indorsement given
them by the big audience, and Donald
Bowles, as Bean, the correspondent,
was brimful of the right sort of energy.
"Held by the Enemy" will run the
whole of the present week and wflT be
succeeded by "Under Two Flags." be
ginning with next Sunday matinee.
Next week, Florence Roberts, in
"Tess of the d'Urbervilles."
"The Man of Mystery" lived up to
his name last night at the California
Theater, where the Elmer Walters
Company began Its last week, by com
pletely mystifying not only the char
acters of the piece, but the audience
as well. Stanley Johns made a very
pale "Shadow," to whom poison,
knives, guns and hypnotism were sec
ond nature. First the old man, then
the rest of the family fell victims to
his charms. The only one who was
beyond his spell was the hero. Harry
Van Meter. Nothing but the final cur
tain could kill him. â¢ Harry Llewellyn
amused the house with his rendering
of the negro and received a thundering
round when he entered boldly into the
thieves' den and held up the "crook,
played by Howard H. Hogan, and the
fence, played by Lloyd Ingraham.
Agnes Williams as Florence Green
wood was pleasing. Maude Monroe
was acceptable in two bits, neither of
them being startling parts. Kathlyn
Florence had the burden of the acting
of the piece and acquitted herself well.
The rest of the bill goes, and artists
particularly. All those interested in the
symmetrical development of the hu
man bodv should not fail to see "Tre
loar," who, as the man behind me
ecstacised, "has Sandow skinned."
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
â¢ â¢ â¢
The doctor inquires if Skinny were a
good fellow. Savs Mamie solemnly:
"Skinny was de limit. Why! â spit
in his face and it was all up with yer!"
But Skinny is not dead. Skinny has
only stolen a bunch of real flowers for
his little slum sweetheart. Mamie has
taken off her safety-pinned everyday
gown for a tight-backed Sunday one
and, bouquet in hand, they are off to'
swell it down the alley. But the "cop
per" comes. Skinny has to go. Mamie
is left with a despairing "Hullv Gee!"
on her lips.
There are fun, humanity and real
pathos in the sketch, and something
as fresh and whole-hearted is the act
ing of Miss Williams and Mr. Tucker.
Miss Williams' tough girl make-up
does not disguise the fact that she is
a very pretty girl. Mr. Tucker's dis
guises leave one, on the contrary, in
considerable doubt as to what or which
he is. \
"Duse of 'vaudeville." "Well, it's safe
here. Duse is still to come. Still, what
has preceded her does not look a bit
like Miss Williams to me. Say Edna
Aug now, or Nora Bayes, with a dash
of Maude Adams â how's that, Eva?
With Joe Tucker Miss Williams pre
sents an "original creation" â which is
both original and a creation â called
"Sklnnv's finish." Miss Williams Is a
Flat Alley girl and Mr. Tucker isâ or
areâ three Flat Alley gentlemen. He is
"Skinny," in love with Mamie. He is
Dick Kanary. who "pinches the apples"
Mamie Is saving for a banquet to her
"steady." He, is a doctor that Mamie
mistakes for. an undertaker and from
whom she orders a "silver plate for
Skinny's mahogany," thinking he has
"slipped his trolley." He also imi
tates a crying baby that I should think
he would have to walk the floor nights
with.

been resorted to in San Rafael and San
Mateo.
The campaign by the Berkeley Board
of Health against the mosquito pest
is producing results. Some time ago
the mosquitoes became so troublesome
that Dr. Frank Woolsey, health officer,
decided to spread crude oil over the
breeding places of t the pests. This was
done some weeks ago and the conse
quences have been carefully noted. It
has been found that the treatment, has
resulted in a lessening of the Insects.
Dr. Woolsey is now waiting to hear
of places that have been overlooked "in
the oil treatment. Thus far he has not
been able to cover the surface of all
the breeding places. .-> ~ :

Captain cf Polite \V. J. Petersen has
taken a contract to break up Chinese
lottery gambling In Oakland. His first
move to acoompHsh thai result was
made last nijtht when he headed a
posss of patrolmen and with sledges
." and axes smashed and cut his way into
three of the most notorious dens in
;<"hinatown. For three years unmolest
'cl ihese resorts have operated.
Every bit of paraphernalia, desks,
t?bk-s, chairs, marking pots, brushes,
of blank tickets, heavy locks,
iron l>iuiid plank doors two or three
jr.*:hes thick, all of this stuff was de
ttroyod. Hundreds of dollars' worth
'of property was smashed into kindling
wood and huge bundles of blanks were
bUTT-ed. Not a vestige of the outfits
was left intact, and aJ*. of the barri
co les against intrusion were put out
cf commission. After the police squad
had completed its job the dens looked
Â«ta if they had been through a bom
bardment. Halt a dozen wagon loads
of debris were carted on* to the City
Ptiron.
The three places that were attacked
Â¦uÂ«re located at 903, 911 and 921 Web
fcter-s^reet. Patrolmen Hamerton. Mur
. cell. Pardee, Feeley and Caldwell were
ordered to report for special duty at
&:30 o'clock last evening. Some time
later they were told off in pairs with
<'.aptaln Peterson at their head. Each
" detail was assigned to a gambling den.
At a given moment a simultaneous rush
. was made. Boltf-d and barred doors
Â¦were splinterr-d by the heaxy ax and
.rledge swinging. As each place was
,"â¢ Yurced the order was obeyed to smash
everything movable.
In their' attempt to destroy evidence
th* Chines*' samblers at 921 Webster
street set thousands of tickets aflrp.
The police had to light the flames to
jo event the buildings from catching.
No attempt was made to stop the Chi
nese ocruoants of the dens, who fled
over roof tops and by devious ways
â¢to escape the raiding parties. Captain
Pf-tÂ«*iBen said it was useless to make
' aÂ»rÂ»>Â£ts; that the Chinese simply paid
â¢ their fines and returned as if immune
to their gambUnp. The captain said:
Th* matter r,f breaVIryg up C*hinÂ»se lotteries
ha? l*en p^arrd In my fiand*. ThÂ» effectual
way, to ray mind, is to rip the <Â§*Â»nw to pieces
at *v*ry r.f.portunlty. I serve notice now on
?â¢v*>ry EnrcblT that thin will b* the mode of
operation*. If the lotterten are to *-ontinue
thrjr will be at lotst a hazardous tIbIC for
property cwner* to fit theru up. And the city
prison will be furnished with kindling wood
for a lonÂ» time unless the dens are closed.
The Police and Fire departments
want more money . for salaries and
equipment, and they also will be rep
resented at the meeting that promises
to be one of the most important that
has been held in Alameda for a long
time.
The School Department has been
alive to the situation and it has ap
pointed an official committee that will
appear at the meeting to-morrow even-
Ing to tell what the School Department
needs. This committee Is composed of
Frederick T. Moore, Superintendent of
Schools; George Thompson, principal of
the Alameda High School, and Frank
Otis and H^nrv Michaels of the Ala
meda Board of Education. The demand
of the School Department was cut last
year, and It wants more money for re
pairs.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 21.â The Alameda
Advancement Association is going to
discuss the matter of municipal taxa
tion at its meeting to-morrqw even
ing, and those interested in the work
of the different departments of the city
government have been invited to at
tend and express their views.
There have been several suggestions
made recently that involve the increas
ing of the expense of the city govern
ment. Tbe police patrolmen want their
pay increased from JSO to $90 a month,
and there have been demands made for
the increase of the salaries of different
officials connected with the municipal
electric lighting department. As the
business of the town has grown there
have been a few increases in the salar
ies of some of the department "heads,
but now the town is confronted with a
general demand for more money all
down the line. Since the fire at the
West End last week there has been
a demand for more fire apparatus, and
the ladies of the Adelphian Club have
undertaken the task of securing a
larger appropriation for the schools of
the city.
As the City Council will have to set
tle these matters and'decfde what is
best for the city, and as the Alameda
Advancement Association has the best
interests of the city at heart, it was
natural that thev should call a meet
ing to discuss the various points at
Issue.

. Inquiries which are of particular Interest are
for building lots in the Santa Fe tracts from
San Frtnc'seo rent payers, from Oakland and
Berkeley people, and even from resident* of
various parts of California from Chico to San
Luis Oblspo. One Instance among many which
may now te. cited Is that of a family paying
?33 per month. rent for an apartment of three
rooms In- San Francisco. This family has
bought a lot 40xK15 In the Santa Fe Tract,
within two minutes" walk of the Fifty-flfth
istreet station of the Key Route, which is Just
twenty-eight minutes" distant from San Fran
cisco. The price of the lot Is $750. < The pur
chaser Is iiow erecting ft six or seven room
house costing $2000. thus making an Invest
ment of $2750 for a home. At 6 per cent In
terest on this investment this family will be
at an -expense of $13 75 per month, as com
pared with $33 per month rent in San Fran
ciacd, and will have the advantage or a large,
roomy house and lot Instead of the three rooms
now occupied by them in . a San Francisco
apartment house. Other advantaged are the
mild climate, opportunity for flower gardens, a
good view of the Berkeley hills and of the
bay, good sehools and all street work, includ
ing cement sidewalks, completed without ex
pense to the lot buyer.
On some days of the week from ten to
twenty persons may be seen at one time walk-
Ing or driving over the Santa Fe tracts, se
lecting lots. These purchasers come over the
Key Route and Southern Pacific local trains
from San Francisco and over the Grove-street
and other street car lines which pass through
or near thÂ« tracts. Many San Francisco people
are among the purchasers, who are finding In
the moderate price.* and location 6f these lots
a solution of the disadvantage under which
they now rert in paying high rents. ,
Other local dealers report market
conditions Improving as the vacation
season draws to a close.

provement Club have taken up the

The storm center seemed to follow
the river course, only the edge passing
over the northwest end of the reserva

torn away and hurled' against wires,
crashing them to the ground.
The slate of the south roof of the
Thirtieth Battery quarters was torn
from its fastening and distributed over
a large area. Portions of the roofs of
the houses of. the Tenth Battery and
the gun shed were also ripped loose,
exposing the upper floors to the fury ol
the- torrent of rain that poured down
incessantly for half an hour. Small
patches of slate from the roofs of many
other Quarters were also torn away,
but in the, aggregate not much damage
was done. The "principal Inconvenience
caused by the storm was the derange
ment of the telephone and electric light
systems. The great force of the wind
carried down poles and wires, disturb
ing connections and putting out lights
throughout the buildings.
The wind . had . apparently . spent a

ATASCADERO. Aug. 21.â The grand
review Â«jf the troops encamped here
passed <jff in a blaze of glory to-day at
Asuncion ttatiun. The weather was
cool and a slight breeze was stirring, in
great contrast to the extreme heat of
yesterday. The ceremonies were wit
nesfed by a crowd of about 100Q people.
Th<?y came from all sections of the
county and even from as far south as
San Diego. Every train was crowded
to its capacity. Everybody within a
radius of fifty miles from this point
that could f.nd me-ans of transportation
came to witness the impressive ceremo
nies. In the inclosure adjoining the
depot were at least 400 teams of every
sort, kind and description. There were

six-horse wagons, buggies and carts â
in fact, everything that cou'd be util
ized to transport the crowd was in evi

The resolution passed to-day com
menced by a narration of the condi
tions at the yards. It asserts that the
wages of the laborers in the packing
houses* were eighteen cents an hour,
but the employment was so irregular
that their total weekly earnings did
not amount to more than $7. , It is
then declared that "the packers at
tempted to lower the wages of the
laborers," and the skilled workmen, be
lieving that this would be followed by
a reduction in their own scale of pay,
decided to go out on strike in support
of the unskilled men.
CHICAGO, Aug. 21.â At the regular
meeting of the Chicago Federation of
Labor to-day it was decided to ask
the general public for aid for- the men
on strike in the stockyards. The sec
retary of the federation was also in
structed to request President Gom

Labor to call for a special meeting of
the executive council of that body for
the purpose of devising ways and
means of sustaining the strikers.

According to the latest police reports,
there are at present ninety places
against which strikes have been de
clared! and which are receiving police
protection. It takes one-fourth of the
force to provide this protection. The
withdrav/al of such a large number of
policemen from their beats, coupled
with the presence of a vast army of
idle men, has greatlv increased the
number of crimes committed daily
within the city limits.
Some of ''the strikes have been in
progress since the first of the year,
and some have had a duration of
twelve to twenty weeks. The total loss
to strikers in the strikes which are
now in force, figuring from the time
that they started, aggregates the enor
mous sum of $2,602,000. The loss to the
various industries affected can only be
estimated. It cannot be less than five
times the loss to the strikers.
That there are thousands of men
walking the streets in idleness is
clearly proved by the registrations at
the various employment bureaus. The
registration office of the Employers'
Association of Chicago has been open
a little more than a month, vet in that
time nearly 2000 men have registered
and applied for positions, and appli
cations are coming in at the rate of fifty
a day. Of these applicants 11 per cent
are union men and 89 per cent are
non-union . men. â¢ . ->M~:
CHICAGO, Au_. 21.â In Chicago to
day there are 22,1SO persons on strike,
and, the amount of money they are los
ing In wages approximates J409.50O for
every week they remain out. The
workers, however, are not the only
sufferers, for the burden falls equally
upon their familiesâ the mothers and
children who are dependent upon the
wage earners for their sustenance and
who number 112,560 souls.

J. S. Holden, secretary of the Edito
rial Association of Indian Territory and
editor of the Fort Gibson Post, has
added some exceedingly interesting
facts to the story of Sam Houston and
his Cherokee wife. We copy this ex
tract from Mr. Holden's article on the
subject: "Wilsons Rock is a beautiful
spot on the Cherokee side of the Ar-"
kansas River, on a hill near the mouth
of Skinbayou Creek. Here in a cedar 1
grove lived in a log cabin with his
Cherokee wife the former Governor of
Tennessee and distinguished general. It
was from here he started on horseback
for Texas, of which State he became
the liberator and first Governor. Tahli
hina (his wife) is said to have been the
most beautiful woman in the Cherokee
tribe, and Houston was not ashamed
of her. He wrote to have her join him
in Texas, which she declined, saying
she was an- Indian and would not be
happy among his white associates. It
appears he really loved her and re
solved to see her again In her forest
abode had not death intervened.

score years have gone since the fair
form of Tahlihina was laid at rest be-

A certain missionary in one of the
rescue homes in local Chinatown is
disgusted, and declares that she in
tends to retire and give up the work
of saving souls. All on account of lit
tle "Dan Cupid," who has been using
the mission as a means to further his
ends*
One day not long ago a neatly
dressed Chinaman entered the mission
and Informed the lady in charge that
In a certain allev in Chinatown there
was a slave girl who wished to 'run
away to the mission and study Chris
tianity, but was unable to do so on
account of her owner, who was nego
tiating her sale for $2000 to an old
gambler.
The next day the missionary made
her appearance in the alley, and with
the help of an interpreter and a po
lice sergeant rescued the girl, who took
up her abode in the mission. She be
came an interested pupil and soon em
braced Christianity.
About the same time the Chinaman
who had caused the rescue appeared.
This time he wished to join the church
himself. He had not been a member
long before he came forward with the
request for a wife, which was granted.
Among the names suggested was that
of the rescued girl, and he chose her.
Her consent was the only condition
and, needless to say, that was easily
obtained. *
The wedding was not delayed. The
time taken to deceive the missionaries
had been too long for the loving hearts.
They were united by the mission pas
tor, after which they left for a joss
house and were married by the priest
in real Chinese fashion.
The last the missionaries heard of
them they were living in the heart
of Chinatown and were worshiping
joss, even more devoutly than their
neighbors. Later it was discovered that
the Chinaman, who was really the
girl's lover, but had not sufficient funds
with which to purchase her, had used
the missionary people in this shrewd
manner. He got the girl he loved
without paying the $2000. But the mis
sionary has lost her confidence in the
yellow race.

"President Roosevelt's sons are evi

respecting Archie Roosevelt shows. A
certain fine lady was calling at the
house of one of Archie's schoolmates
when Archie happened to be In. On be
ing told that the lad was the son of the
President and attended a public school
the visitor began questioning him
about his . studies. Archie stood this
well enough, but presently the lauy
ventured on more delicate ground. 'Do
you like a public school?' said she.
'Don't you find that many of the boys
there are rough and common ?V Then
Archie showed his training and uncon
sciously administered something of a
rebuke to the would-be aristocrat. 'My
papa says,' he answered, 'that there are
tall boys and short boys, and good boy3
and bad boy3, and those are the only
kind of boys there are.' "

A little book Just published bv the
police department from the pen of
Policeman Maurice Behan contains
many little human interest stories per
taining to the force. The book is en
titled "The Strange Doings of Shang
hai Brown." One of the stories' in the
volume is as follows:
"Shanghai" Brown was cited to ap
pear before the Board pf Police Com
missioners on a charge of reporting late
for duty. The case was called and
Brown, with his usual facility for put
ting up a feasible defense, was on deck
with "the goods."
Brown's defense. was that he was sit
ting up with his sick fatner and could
not leave him until the nurse came.
Brown had not seen his father for
twenty vears and did not know where
he was, but he had .to have a defense.
"What kind of a looking man is your
father?" asked a dubious commissioner.
"Oh, he's an old man with whiskers
down to here," answered the man
charged, at the same time Indicating
by the seventh button on hi3 vest the
langth of his dad's dermal appendage.
"Put the case over for one week in
order that the officer may produce his
father here . as a witness," thundered
the cnairman. "
Any other man would have been in
a quandary at this sudden turn of af
fairs, but Brown was ready for any
emergency. Going home that night on
a car. Brown met a' fellow officer.
"Bill," he said, "vou've always been
a good friend to me; help me to find
a bum with whiskers down to his
waist."- Another car was passing at
the time, and Brown spotted his man â
a lean looking individual with the nec
essary appendage. In a bound he was
on the other car.
"For $5 you are my father," he cried
to the astonished bum. at the same
time dislodging him from his corneK
The bum didn't understand, but saw
booze in sight and dismounted from
the vehicle with Brown. A few Jolts
at a neighboring wet goods parlor fixed
the deal." The bum pocketed $2 50; the
rest he was to get after the next meet
ing of the Board of Police Commis
sioners.
"Shanghai" and his new-found dad
appeared at the next meeting of the
board.
"Are you this man's father?" asked
the commissioners.
"Dat's what I am." answered the
subsidized Brown. "Me boy George is
a fine lad; so kind to his old father."
The scene was touching. Brown
wept; and as he and his "father"
walked from the presence of the au
gust body, exonerated, Chairman How
ell crazed after them with a question
of doubt still lingering in his eyes.

â¢ Berlin is reveling in the possession of a horse that un
derstands music and can solve disturbing problems in
mathematics. If the animal can only make logical deduc

As a military man the university . cadet, collectively
considered, has fallen far below the standard fixed by the
director, of his soldierly education. In the eyes of the
supervising critic the Berkeley student soldier is stoop
shouldered, narrow lunged, shuffling of stride and negli
gent of carriage. Yet reform speaks its own suggestion.
Give the boys the same, chance to win laurels on the

The welcome announcement has been made that Sena
tor Fairbanks will pay us a visit before he is elected
Vice President of the United States. That we will be
pleased to sec him and have him as our guest goes with

of California to see a Vice President of the republic a
statesman from within her borders, the next thing for
congratulation is to plead the cause of our hospitality to
one who comes from abroad.
â¢'The present Dalai has been per
mitted to become an exception to this
rule. As this was a blow against the
"Henceforth the Dalai Lama always
died young. He never^ attained his
jÂ»ajority. No sooner had a Dalai
reached the age of 18 than he died in
a mysterious manner, thus necessi
tating the accession of a new born in
fant and prolonging the Regent's term
of office. So a Regent was always in
charge of the Government and he has
worked in collusion with the Chinese
Ambans to limit the life of the Dalai
Lamas. *Of the last four Dalai Lamas
one died at 11 and the other three at

A London dispatch to the New York

the little known secrets of official life
Jn Tibet. Colonel Waddel'. a well
Jcnon-n expert in Tibetan matters, de
scribes therein hew since 1749 it had
been the policy of Lassa up to the
present reign to assassinate every
Dalai Lama. In 174 9, the Tibetans
having massacred the Chinese at
Lassa, the Chinese Emperor Chau
lung sent a punitive army and re
stored the Chinese ascendency and the
influence of the Chinese Ambans was
enormously increased. They kept the
appointment of a Regent in their own
hands and were the real driving pow

THE Monkey of the Andes, Castro, has been mon
keying again with American affairs, and is a candi
date for a hard call down by our Government. He
is a sample of the predatory chiefs who fight and steal
their way to the front in some of the Latin-American
States. As his o-vn people dare not acquire anything
worth his while to steal, he proposes to sustain his lav
ish ways by the robbery of foreigners. His experience
with the powers that through blockade haled him into
the Hague court has taught him no prudence.
His seizure of the American Asphalt Company's
property has no excuse and is incapable of .defense.
One of his courts, in a proceeding ex parte, pretended
to issue a process for executive spoliation of the Amer
icans. He ordered the court to do this. The Americans
were not notified of any suit, had no day in court, no op
portunity for defense, and were surprised when a na
tional ship appeared with an armed force and ousted
them from their property.
Now the Monkey pleads that as it is a judicial pro
ceeding he cannot interfere 1 It is remembered that when
the builders and owners of the railway between Porto
Cabello and Caracas went into court in defense of their
rights, a Supreme Court justice decided in their favor,
and was immediately thrown into jail by Castro, who at
once appointed a judge in his place who was ordered to
reverse the decision and did sol Of course with that
history one understands the extreme delicacy of the
Monkey about interfering with the courts 1 The United
States will probably not wait long for him to over
come this sensitiveness, but wijl send a> man-of-war to
oust the usurpers of American property rights, whether
the Monkey likes it or not.
But the incident is discouraging. Those States are
our neighbors. They share with'us the American hem
isphere. We protect their sovereignty and territorial
integrity against the world. We risked war with Great
Britain in defense of Venezuela, but our attitude does
not result in teaching them stability of government and
the protection of the rights of person and property. It
is probable that they will never have civil order until
we give them â¢ a severe lesson, or permit some other
power to administer it.
VENEZUELA AGAIN.
In accepting the Populist nomination for the Presi
dency Watson declared that in the consideration of na
tional problems all Democrats are hypocrites, but Re
publicans have the saving grace of being honest -foes of
the principles hjs party represents. If Watson be sin
cere in wishing well for the nation his own assertion
should convince them N that the cause he espouses is lost
in error and must fail.
The heart of London, the region
about the Bank of England and the
Royal Exchange, whence go the
chief arteries of the country, is situated
in the strangest parish in the world.
There Is no church, no municipal office
and but one inhabitant, yet its value
in a parochial and official sense is
equal to that of many another parish
In the cits* with its thousands of rate
payers. It Is parish of St. Chris
topher-le-Stocks, founded some TOO
years ago, none knows how or by
whom, but still existent with all its
rights and dignities.
There are close upon a dozen other
parishes within the small circuit of
the civic boundaries of London proper
which possess but one or two inhabit
ants, but their history and lineage pale
in interest beside that of St. Chrlsto
pher-le-Stocks. The church itself stood
in Threadneedle street and was demol
ished at the time the Bank of England
was enlarged in 1781. It therefore stood
fronting the Mansion House, and from
many old records we must assume that
it was a stately edifice, altered and
beautified after the ravages 1 of Lon
do"n's fire by Sir Christopher Wren
and embellished by gifts from wealthy
city aldermen.
We read of It first In the year 1392.
when a rich merchant, one Richard
Sherington, gave "many and divers
gifts to this church." But the church
must have been in existence over a
hundred years prior to this date, for
without the gate stood a pair of stocks,
for the punishment of. those whose
offenses had been committed within the
city boundaries. But they abol
ished in the year 1282, when Edward I
was King and Henry Walls Mayor of
London.
At the time the tools derived from
London bridge were insufficient for its
upkeep and Mayor Walis, with the
royal permission, established a "fish
and flesh market near by the Church
of St. Christopher-le-Stocks." The
Stocks Market was designed to help
London Bridge, the bridge-keeper hav
ing power to grant leases. for market
shops. The church was the spiritual
resort of "all godly shopkeepers."
There is a lapse of time and then in
the year 1472 we read of William
Hampton, Mayor of London, who visit
ed the church frequently "for his eoul's
benefit, for he was a devout man and
pious." At liis death he left money to
St. Christopher's, and "was a great
benefactor and glazed some of the win
dows."
The next reference comes in the
year 1543, when Henry VIII was re
ceiving Â£46 15s â¬d as rent for the
market. There were twenty-five fish
mongers and eight butchers and the
marketplace was 230 feet long by 108
feet wide. "On the east side," writes
the old historian, "there were rows
of trees, very pleasant to the inhabi
tants." The vicar received the great
er part of his yearly income from the
shopkeepers, "godly men and women,
given muchly to holy observances."
In the year 1624 Robert Thorne
died and left Â£4445 to the church "in
charity and pious uses." Accordingly
a stately monument was erected to his
memory- Later in the century the
church was partly destroyed in the
great fire and was repaired by Wren
in 1671 and twenty- five years later was
"again repaired and beautified at
much cost to the parish." In 1737
the stocks market was removed to
Farringdon street, the region about
the church being then of greater im
portance to merchants than shop
keepers.
As commerce grew the Bank of
England encroached upon the grave
yard, and' so in 1781 the church was
demolished. But in order perhaps to
salve the consciences of the money
makers the^parochial rights and dig
nities were still maintained. The gar
den with the fountain within the Bank
â¢of England marks the site of the bur
ial ground. The last interment took
place a hundred years ago and was
that of "Jenkins, a bank clerk, 7 feet
6 inches high. His body was allowed
to be buried within the bank to pre
vent temptation and possibility of dis
intcrment." *.
So the old church has gone, but its
parish remains, embracing the open
space in front of the Bank and Man
sion House, part of the Royal Ex
change and part of the Bank of Eng
land. One Inhabitant it has and he
has full rights of voting for Parlia
ment and all municipal councils. The
valuation list is made out year by
year and the governors of the Bank
of England . still pay heavily for the
sins of covetousness of their ancestors

"It wasn't that I had anything
p-irainst the Americans," the shopman
told me the other day,* "but when they
come in here 'Just lookln' around,' walk
through, ask a hundred questions and
leave without even thanking me, you
can't wonder I thought the time was
wasted.
"Probably they have plenty of money,
too," he went on, "but they don't come
In with the Intention of buying and
I'm beginning to think that most of
them that come over here wouldn't
know what- to buy If they did â that's
â¢why I put In the 'Judgment sound." A
little party was here not long ago
when I had a Dresden group on that
table. I had Just sold, it to & man for
CO pounds ($300) and it stood there
Â¦waiting to be packed. One of the men
In the party asked what It was and
how much it was worth. I told him
that as it was' a very good article It
ought to bring a round sum of money.
Well, would you believe It, he said,
â¢I'll give you two dollars and a half." "
Already- th!s summer a number of
'Americans have called to inquire about
the sign and as several of these have
teen on theif first visit to London the
f hop must be well known in some parts
of the United States.
The firt^ American that day was a
man who stopped, read the verse, and
â¢when the dealer looked out, asked:
"What will you take for the sign?"
'Â¦What do you want it for?" asked
the shopkeeper.
"To frame and hang up in my house,"
replied the traveler, "as one of the
funniest things I ever struck."
"Well," the dealer replied, "if you
pive my rran here a shilling you can
have 1L I can write another."
Before many weeks the dealer, be
fides selling a curio now and then,
v,as doing a thriving business in signs
and his fame spread all over town.
Then one morning: came a letter written
en the stationers* of the Grand Hotel:
"If you do not desist," it ran, "from
insulting my countrymen by exposing
that sign about them in your window
I'll give you an ounce of lead." The
signature was perfectly strange to the
curio man, but thinking that the
writer might be some fanatic capable
cf keeping his word, down came the
*-:pn and it has not been put back
eixice.
The proprietor of the shop and au
thur of the verse is the pioneer of the

Wardour street, find as very few
Transatlantic visitors leave London
without making a tour of the district,
the poet always has received his share
of choppers. Season after season, he
velcorned the Grangers, but as 95 per
cent of them departed without spend
ing a penny the patient proprietor be
pan to suspect that the Americans
were a nation of "lookers around."
It was while the shopkeeper lay in
bed one night In his bachelor rooms
ever the shoo that the verse came
to him. The previous day had been es
pecially productive of tourists with
j>!enty of questions about every ar
ticle which struck their fancy, but with
t.o inclination whatever to buy, and the
thought struck the proprietor that
these lines, boldly written on a card
end prominently displayed In the win
dow, might give him some relief. First
thing next morning he wrote the sign,
adding the patriotic words as a sort
pf flourish, and hung it up.

California's name as a generous host has been made
famous very largely by the convening of national assem
blies of various kinds in San Francisco or Los Angeles.
Individuals, from the days when the owner of a placer
mining claim by a Sierran watercourse divided willingly
and gladly his waning store of provisions with the new
comer, have welcomed the stranger in California. In
numerable friendships, based upon bestowing and re
ceiving courtesies at the hands of the men and women
of this State have cemented more closely the ties that
bind together the American people scattered over the
breadth of a continent. As the less is included in the
greater, the hospitality of individuals has been even
more effectively employed collectively by fraternities
than it could be by persons acting singly.
The uses of large sums of money in the hands of ex
ecutive committees and the greater facilities procurable
through fraternal agencies have made' it possible to de
vise and carry out plans for entertainment on a very
From these considerations it clearly is manifest that
a debt is due to the fraternal orders and to all associa
tions, secular and religious, in California that have vol
untarily assumed the burdens with the pleasures of
greeting and providing for the comfort of thousands of
affiliated strangers simultaneously. If San Francisco
is regarded as "a show city" and if its place as such is
to be maintained, the effort and credit must alike be at
tributed to organizations.
California has been for many years proud of its frater
nities. In the mining days members were to be found
in every camp. Now they are enrolled by thousands. By
them works of mercy and charity have been wrought
in countless instances. Their pledges are for brother
hood and sisterhood. Their aims are noble. By them
love and its genial handmaiden hospitality have been
fostered. They have benefited the State morally, so
cially, financially. More than any others they have ad
vertised California. Hospitable among their own mem
bership, they have impartially extended the right hand
of welcome to all comers.
THE time is opportune to consider the part that
fraternal organizations have taken to establish the
reputation of California hospitality. Numerous rep
resentatives of two famous orders are about to be enter
tained in this city. The general public of California will
throng to see them, and many persons who are > not
members of either of the two orders will contribute
financially to make their sojourn agreeable. The task of
caring for the personal comfort and enjoyment of the
visitors will fall to Odd Fellows and Knights Templar.
They will^ unquestionably heighten among their frater
nal associates from abroad the esteem in which Califor
nia is held. From their own means and exertions they
will strive.
try, and days mus.t elapse ere the new conditions and
their effect on general trade can be analyzed and de-
This damage to the wheat crop in the Northwest is
nothing new. It was observed during the first week in
August, when those operators whose business it , is to
keep close watch over the grain situation called atten
tion to it and began to change their plans accordingly,
it was not kept secret from -anybody. Brokers' and
millers' reports, the personal inspection of wheat regions
by grain statisticians and the investigation of elevator
corporations air gave the deterioration of the crop wide
publicity. But it was received .with skepticism. It was
considered in many quarters a crop scare to manipulate
quotations. Two weeks ago The Call pointed it out and
reported that Wall street received the adverse reports
with a smile and the remark that this was the time of
the year for crop scares. The Call also printed a report
from a party of investigators that "the trade would be
stunned if it realizedthe extent of the damage." It gave
full accounts of the increasing outcry of "rust.'.' -
All this went on for about ten days, when the wheat
trade woke up to it. Then the excitement began and
has been raging ever since, with the market extremely
nervous and quotations rising with unusual rapidity.
Europe added its fuel to the flames, as pointed out in
this column at the time, by reducing its crop estimates
all along the line. Now everybody realizes that there is
trouble in the spring wheat districts and that the rust
infection has extended from the three States â Minnesota
and the Dakotas â into Manitoba. %^^
How much these reports are exaggerated, if at all, re
mains to be seen. Of course the bull speculators will
magnify them all they possibly can. But there has been
damage. Even the Government bureaus, always, ex
tremely conservative, affirm that and are reducing their
estimates of the crop. But the harvest alone will render
the final verdict. When the threshing returns are in we
shall know all about it, and they are coming in now.
Pages could be written upon the new trade conditions
create^ by tfis falling off in the volume of that wheat
crop, which gave such brilliant promise a month ago.
Business currents have been diverted into new channels,
railroad traffic plans and prospects have undergone
radical changes, a new aspect has been given to the New
York stock market, export calculations are being revised
and new sets of figures arranged in many commodities.
Of course, all this unsettles trade. It makes some lines
feverishly active and stuns others. The situation pre
viously established is now afloat like a stray balloon. It
has left the prosaic ground and is a feather in the air.
Until it gets settled again and on a determined basis there
will be more or less uncertainty.
The corn crop also had its specter for a day or so in
the form of dry weather, which threatened to develop
into a drought in the belt, but the rains that damaged
the wheat yield extended into the corn regions and
-nipped this new trouble in. the bud. They were a two
edged sword, detrimental to^one crop and beneficial to
another. It is indeed an ill wind that blows no good.
New York regards the new conditions in the Northwest
with equanimity. The West sees nothing but grain,
general farm produce and provisions. But New York
has the whole country under its eye. The disaster to the
wheat crop is something affecting one section of the
country. There are other sections and other crops. Out
of them. all it strikes a general average, and that average
is favorable. Hence Wall street, though naturally in
fluenced more or less by the new conditions in the West,
is governed by the general average of the country, and
the market stands about the same. Money is the weather
vane on which the New York eye is fixed, and as the vane
still points to fair weather New York is satisfied with
the present outlook. The fact is, the country has so much
ready cash that it can handle all its vast business and
leave an enormous amount in vault untouched. Under
this condition it is needless to get excited over a loss of
IS per centâ io per cent a week agoâ in the wheat crop.
A prominent financier in New York thus sums up the
crop situation: Increase in value of cotton crop, $80,
000,000; increase in value of corn crop, $100,000,000; in
crease in value of oat crop, $30,000,000; total increase,
$210,000,000; deficiency in wheat, $75,000,000; net increase,
$i3S.ooo,ooo. This is the cold-blooded way in which New
York regards the situation, and it is the right way.
The bank clearings made a more favorable showing for
the week, recovering to some $1,875,000,000, the loss from
the corresponding week in 1903 being only 2 per cent.
Half the important cities showed a gain. The failures
were 226, against 238 in 190.3.
Conservatism prevails in the great industrial staples.
Cotton goods buying is sluggish and is not responding to
the reductions in bleached goods, as wholesalers are ex
pecting lower quotations later on. There is a fair demand
for woolen goods, but the raw wool ts so high that manu
facturers are proceeding with caution. A number of
tanneries have closed down on account of the scarcity
in hides caused by the Western packing-house strike, and
leather has gone up half a cent. A wholesale reduction
in some steel prices, notably wire nails, is announced, and
uncertainty as to how far the reductions will extend re
stricts buying. In addition, several pools in iron and
steel products are reported shaky, hence the, iron trade
is still far from being in* a stable condition.
Provisions still lack snap at Western packing centers.
Reports from these points say that the acuteness of^the
strike is over and that conditions in the industry are
now getting back to the normal, and the strike itself has
lost importance under the overshadowing influence of
the wheat shortage. It is still more or less of a factor,
however. Railway earnings for the first week in August
show a gain of 1.4 per cent over last year, an agreeable
change from the loss lately exhibited from week to week.
Conditions in the three Pacific Coast States remain
about as before stated. The sectional character of the
weather during the first half of the year has produced
large crops in some sections and deficient crops in others.
The net result on the whole is satisfactory. Prices for
the majority of farm and orchard products are still above
the normal, and what the farmer loses in one line he
more than makes up in another, so the average is ex
ceptionality high and no serious complaints are heard
from any quarter. As for San Francisco, the steady
stream of immigration from the West continues, and
being incidentally augmented by the coming conclave of
the Knights Templar, is bringing a good deal of new
money into the town and givcs.it a bustling and cheerful
aspect SOS *
TRADE conditions were decidedly unsettled last
week. The complete reversal in the wheat crop
prospect since August i, which the trade did not
fully wake up to until a few days ago. has materially
.'.Itered the complexion of business throughout the coun-

CALL BUREAU, PRESS BUILD
ING, WORLD'S FAIR, St. Louis, Aug.
21. â Philippine day was one of the big
gest events at the fair and the dog
eating Igorrotes, the savage Moros and
the midgets weren't on top of the foot
lights. As a counter attraction, for this
day only, the presence of Admiral
Dewey, Secretary of War Taft, Lieu
tenant General Merritt, Generals Funs
ton, King, Chaff ee and other notables
was advertised. As a consequence, men
who cut. a figure In the financial and
commercial worldâ men who build rail
roads and lav out- cities and develop
a country's resources â visited the reser
vation.
Of all the galaxy of notables adver
tised only Secretary of War Taft and
Genetal Merritt appeared, but the men
of money and commercial standing,
who had been attracted by the an
nouncement of the list of distinguished
visitors, didn't allow the absence of
a few of the notables to prevent them
going through the exhibit buildings
and viewing the wonderful evidences
of rich resources there displayed.
They were surprised, and still more
so when they met some of the cultured
Filipinos, who were present as the
higher class representatives of their
country. These business men had never
believed there was anything to see in
the Philippine exhibit but a lot of bam
boo corrals containing stupid looking
savages feasting on dogmeat, and they
had never cared to witness the eating
of dog, as they lived either at respec
table clubs or comfortable homes, and
could scarcey bear the sight of hu
man beings devouring such food. What
they saw In the exhibit buildings will
not soon leave tHeir minds. They saw
there those things which mean a field
for capital â always looking for profita
ble Investment â and the probabilities
of drawing dividends from Philippine
investments will be the subject of
many a conversation at club and of
fice as a result of the Igorrotes being
given secondary place to the Secretary
of War and General Merritt on Phil
ippine day.
The Board o'f Honorary Commission
ers, sent over by the insular govern

members are deliberating on the rec

general admission of 25 cents to the
grounds and make ' everything Inside
free. Whatever it does, the board
would better make the resources of the

The flagship 7$ew York, with Admiral
Goodrich on board, the cruiser Marble
head and the gunboat Bennington are
due to-day from the north. They have
been away from here for months and,
as the orders from the Navy Depart
ment now stand, their visit will be
brief. It was hoped that the fleet would
remain here until after the Knights
Templar conclave, but no orders to that
effect hav% been issued.
The New York is under orders to
proceed from here to the Atlantic, and
in company with the Marblehead. Ben
nington and Boston, will start south
in a few days. The three smaller ves
sels will accompany the flagship for
only a few hundred miles. The New
York will continue alone and, it is ex
pected, will meet the cruiser Chicago
at Valparaiso.
The Chicago is on her way to this
station from the other side of the con
tinent. When the cruisers meet Ad
miral Goodrich will transfer his flag
to the Chicago and on the new flag
ship will return to this port.
The New York, Bennington and Mar
blehead left here" to straighten out
matters at Panama, and when that
mission had been fulfilled they pro
ceeded to Honolulu, where they re
mained for some time. Since leaving
Honolulu they have been to Alaska
and have spent some time on Puget
Sound. Just before Puget Sound the
fleet visited the British naval station
at Esquimau, where the officers
H. M. S. Grafton entertained their
American cousins in royal style.
The case of Dr. Benjamin F. Stoll.
charged with murder, will be called
in Judge Cook's court this morning
to be set^for. trial. The Judge has In
structed the clerk of his court to noti
fy each of the Jurors who tried the
case before to appear In court so that
they can be impaneled to retry it.
Dr. Stoll Is a member of the firm of
Decker & Stoll. dentists. Phelan
building. Dr. Robert J. Blake was
also connected with the firm. There
had been trouble between Stoll and
Blake regarding patients and It cams
to violence, on the afternoon of Oc
tober 16, 1902. Stoll shot Blake, who
died three days later.
Stoll was held to answer and was
tried before a jury In Judge Cook's
court on January S. 1903. The de
fense set up a plea of self defense
and after hearing the testimony the
Judge Instructed the jury to return a
verdict of acquittal and Stoll was
discharged from custody.
District Attorney Byington filed an
appeal on the ground that the Judga
erred In instructing the jury to ac
quit. The Supreme Court recently
sustained the appeal and ordered a
new trial. The remlttltur was re
ceived by Judge Cook on July 25 and
the case is on the calendar for this
morning to be set.
As the Judge takes the ground that
the same jurors shall retry the casa
it Is expected that they will render
another verdict of acquittal. The rea
son for their selection is that they
had not at the previous trial an op
portunity of rendering their verdict,
having been Instructed to do so by
the Judge.

lightful evening was spent, welding to
gether the friendships of the Britishers,

The Year Book of the California I
Club is now in course of compilation,
and the members are earnestly urged
to send their addresses, if different
from that of last year, to the treasurer,
Mrs. Swain, or the financial secretary,
Miss Susanne Patch, 1521 Clay street.
The California Club women are now
gathering up the threads of last year's
activities, and it would seem that the
year will open auspiciously, with Mrs.
Aylett R. Cotton in the chair.
For so large a club, and with so
many members of strong personalities,
with very definite ideas upon the issues
of the day, the amalgamation is really
an achievement. It certainly speaks
well for. the clubable qualities of
women, which have for so long fur
nished copy for the humorist.
But It is no idle jest that the club
is rubbing off the rough edge from
feminine personalities â a fact that
make women better companions at the
fireside, for they are "acquiring toler
ance of the opinions of others, control
of tongue 'and temperâ at least, so the
men say, whose* wives have joined a
club or two â and the ability of getting
"the other woman's view," all of which
are constructive agencies toward de
velopment.
But ladies,, have we yet grown accus
tomed to thinking logically? Try It
when your club resumes activities. Try
it when the next opportunity arises for
legislation, and when you . are casting
your vote ask yourself whether the rea
son for that yea or nay is for the good
of the club or because of some personal
grudge or favoritism.

Let it be noted that none of them is

of heart and of foot and get down to
their monthly meetings as speedily as
they stepped Into the first bob-tailed
horse cars that ran in San Francisco â
away back in the 70's.
Why have we waited the coming of
a new century to give honor to these
womenâ no less brave, no less^valua
ble to the communal development than
the menâ the pioneers of California â
whom the whole world honors?
Then here's to the Pioneer Women:
Long may they live, and may their
heroisms be sung in song, and story.
On Saturday, September 27, these
white-haired heroines, daintily bon
neted and pompadoured and gowned
debonair and chatty, Avill hold a re
ception in Golden Gate Hall, between
2 and 5 o'clock, when the following pro
gramme will be presented:
Fellow citizens, how many of you
are aware that **i our busy burg is
an organization known as the Pioneer
Women of California, that numbers
among -its members women who
"struck camp" in San Francisco be
fore-,'53 and who forthwith became
citizens by setting up tents on the
sand dunes on Market street â riot too
far from the water front on Mont
gomery street, lest the b'ars 'd get
'em â and who have stood at the helm
of the city's growth since those wild,
tumultuous days?
Lured by the lust for gold, moral
degenerates from the world's ends had
found their way to San Francisco, en
route to the diggings; gamblers, cut
throats and. paroled. criminals flocked
to the town for a respite from the
mines when they'd made their pile.
Dance halls lined the streets and
alleys and bacchanalian' orgies filled
the air by day and by night. It was
these things, that brought the vigil
ance committee of 3000 respectable
men into existenceâ that the com
munity be purged ' of the parasites,
that the women and children might
breathe a cleaner air and be free to
wander abroad without fear.
This was the atmosphere that these
pioneer women helped to cleanse.
Standing side by side with their men
folk â whom the whole world honors
to-day, as the pioneers of California â
they organized churches, schools and
relief societies and by their earnest
ministrations brought out of chaos
the elements of a civilized commu
nity. â¢
Hardship? Well, we women of the
present day would call them by a
harsher term. Just ask a few of those
white-haired women next Saturday â
the annual celebration of their organ
ization â how they managed to wash,
cook and scrub the children's faces
out of a single bucket of water per
day. And that bucketful had to be
bought from the water-cart man each
day as the donkey trudged along from
house to house.
At the same time ask them how
they had to create stylesâ purely local
â in conformity with the amount of
dry goods on hand â before the ship
was sighted from Telegraph Hill. Ask
them how they had to nurse the sick
and minister to the dying â in this
faraway land of the West. And how
they put good cheer into the hearts
of their men-folk â as women will;
even though their own hearts were
longing for home and "the folks"; for
conditions were -hard for the men of
those days, even as they were for the
women.
Why is not honor due these women,
who stood side by side .with the men?

Wedding bells still a-rlnging! And
Cupid still busy! There's no telling
when the matrimonial pandemonium
will cease â for which, however, we
should be amply grateful, since without
the marriage feasts society would look
like a Sabbath In old Salem.
But with, next month's homecoming
and the advent of the gallant Knights
to the city the city will once more be
gay.

Bteam trials of lately built German
V.ar vessels have been fairly successful
fcs to horsepower and speed. The bat
tleship Mecklenburg * 11,800 tons and
ia calculated horsepower of 14,000 and
*S knots speed made 18.10 knots with
15,171 horsepower. During a continuous
j-un r( 94^4 hours the average speed
Hva? 16.42 knots with 9500 horsepower.
= *The armored cruiser Friedrich Karl,
Â£S00 tons, 17,000 horsepower and 21
knots f?n<H?d, developed 1S.500 horse-
J>ower and 20.6 knots, while Prlnz
Adalbert, a sister ship, averaged 1S.591
Jr-Tfepower and 20.4 knots. The smaller
cruisers have come up to the require
ments, the Hamburg of 2952 tons b^-
Ing a notable example. This vessel was :
â¢calculated to have a speed of 22 knots :
"with 10.000 horsepower and reached
Â£3.15 knots with 11.582 horsepower.
Fince th<? battleship Wittelsbach
* vas launched in 1900 there has been a
marked increase in the rapidity of j
turning out ships from German dock
yards and private yard?. The Wlt
telsbarh and Fchwaben took forty-one
months, the. Zaehringen forty months. |
W*ttin thirty-eight months, but the
Mecklenburg was built and commis
sioned in thirty-four months. The
Prince Adalbert and Roon. built at the
Kiel dockyard, consumed forty-two
â¢ind thlrty-eisrht months* time, respect- j
tvely, while the Fredrich Karl, of the
tame Fize and type, has been buiit and
completed within twenty-eight months.
ThÂ«* latter ship was built by contract
et Hamburg.
Two years ago Chief Constructor
jVittorio Cuniberti of the Italian navy
rsutlined the plans for a battleship
jjossessing the speed of the swiftest
'prmored cruisers and with a battery
end armor excelling all battleships
hitherto built. Its dimensions were
Â£21.5 feet in length. 82 feet breadth
tend displacing 17,000 tons on a mean
draught of 27 feet 8*4 inches: turrets
end belt armor of 12 inches thickness,
end the armament to be comnosed of
twelve 12-inch guns, disposed off in
pairs In fore and aft turrets on the
line of keel, and one turret on each
broadside, while four were to be
placed sinfcly in as many turrets. The
location of these guns was simple and
effective, but there is some, reasonable
tioubt about attaining a speed of 24
knots with the present types of mo
tive power. The largest battleships
yet built are those of the King Ed
torard VII class, which have armor
Sjelts -of 9 inches, turrets 12 inches,
carry batteries of four 12-inch, four
B. 2-inch and ten 6-inch guns, and cal
tulated to have a speed of 18.5 knots.
' Lewis Nixon, ex-president of the de
funct United States Shipbuilding Com
pany, is said to have gone to Russia
to build vessels for the Russian navy.
Mr. Nixon's success In that line was
. not great In this country, owing, prob
ebly. to the fact that a combination
wf shipbuilding, politics and Wall street
financiering do not .work well together.
He has left three unfinished contracts
â¢with the United States navy and a. de
mand for $25,000 has been mad* by "the
* Mexican Government for, his failure to
Â¦build tvro gunboats of the required con
tract speed.
The standardizing of the machinery of
British war vessels has been carried out
!n six armored cruisers of the Duke of
Edinburgh class, now Â«in course of con
struction. Hawthorne & Leslie, at New
eastle-on-Tyr.e, are building the en
gines for the Duke of Edinburgh and
the Achilles, and four other firms have
Contracts for the engines of the four
other ships. The advantages in having
Machinery identical in all parts m ships
cf the same class is quite obvious, and
the success of Hawthorne & Leslie as
engine Guilders has caused the Admir
alty to accept the engines built by that
Jfirm as the standard. One set of pat
terns will naturally reduce the aggre
gate cost, renewal of parts Is greatly
simplified and the engine-room staff
Nvhen transferred to another ship of the
fcame class will feel thoroughly at home
fend experience none of the troubles In
cident to changes from running engines
Tihich are nominally of the same power
end general features, but differing in
the many details that affect final re
fults. Another great advantage is that
the workmanship of the several firms
Vill have a test such as was impossible
Under the old system. In other vessels
the plan of having all the auxiliary ma
chinery ordered at the same time for
Similar vessels, to be Identical and in
terchangeable. Is being carried out.
The King Edward drydoek at Gib
raltar was opened July S. It is the
smallest of the three docks which are
being bui!t, being 450 feet in length,
the others having lengths of 550 feet
lind E50 feet, but all three of 95 feetwidth

The. conclusions of the British Boiler
Commission regarding CLe economy of
three principal types of water-tube
toilers are as folows: That the Bab
cock &. Wilcox boiler and the Belle
ville"s consume from 1.8. pounds to 2.1
ptfunds of coal per hour horsepower,
"while the Yarrow boiler, with large
tubes, consumes 1.9 pounds to 2.2
pounds to reach the same horsepower
es the other two types. In ships of
pay 20,000 horsepower the difference in
Savor of the more economical boilers
Vould amount to 2000 pounds of coal

fi continuous ran ,of twelve, hours.
other advantages the Tar
fc-ow boiler may have to overcome this
excess of consumption and justify its
tise in preference to the Babcock &
rtVilcox or the Belleville types, has not
yet been stated, but nevertheless four
armored cruisers of the Duke of Edin
burgh class are being fitted with four
fifth Yarrow and one-fifth cylindrical
boilers.
A 100-ton floating derrick, tested with
c load of 150 tons, has been built for
the Danzig dockyard. The derrick is
placed on a pontoon, SS feet by 65 feet

The British naval maneuvers this
Vear were somewhat different from
those of last year, and the total number
cf large ships taking part was less than
In 1903. This year there were two se
ries of maneuvers, but both took place
tn home -waters. The first of the series
consisted of combined exercises of /Bl
tactical nature by twenty-four battle
chips and twenty cruisers, the results
of which are to be kept secret, as no
Visitors or correspondents were permit
ted to accompany the fleet. The sec
end series oÂ£ maneuvers, covering the
period of & week, from August 8 to
August 15. was entirely for torpedo
craft, of which there were two fleets,
composed of seventeen torpedo gun
boats, eever.ty-five destroyers, thirty
eight torpedo-boats, five submarines,
two submarine depot ships anÂ« six tor
pedo depot ships. The "blue fleet,"
under Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson, con
testing of six torpedo gunboats, forty
tight destroyers and three torpedo -de
pot ehips, operated in St. Georges
Channel, with bases at Carrlckfergus
end Queenetown and headquarters at
Waterford. The "red fleet," under Rear
.Admiral C. G. Robinson, had Its terri
tory off the west coast of Great Brit
min, with Loch Ryan and Falmouth as
bases and headquarters at Milford

SANTA ROSA, Aug\ 21.â An acci
dent which crushed out the life of a
15-year-old boy happened Saturday at
the Duncans Mills Land and Lumber
Company's plant. Percival Powell, a
lad whose home was at Stockton, was
standing on the mill platform while
workmen were loading a car with
heavy lumber. One of the planks
slipped from the grasp of the work
men and fell on the head of the youth,
killing him instantly.

j Beat the Pacific Eleven by
Three Wtekets.
The Alameda cricket team defeated
the Pacific eleven by 3 wickets and 8
runs yesterday on the Alameda
grounds. The Pacifies won the toss
and went to the wickets. The first
half of the team did well, scoring 100
runs, but the second half broke down,
the last five batsmen making only six
runs. It looked, however, as, though
the Alameda men would not have time
to make the runs, but they compiled a
'total of 16T3 for the loss of only seven
wickets, the chief contributors being
Stahl (5Q). Foster (26) and Baugh
(20). The full details follow:

SEATTLE, Aug:. 21. â Oakland mur
dered Charley Hall's offerings to-day
and then, after a layoff of a couple of
innings, served Shields in the same
way. Seattle's base running was fool
ish and altogether the visitors' runs
came easy. After Oakland had made
seven in the fifth. Seattle started a
great rally, filling the bases and scor
ing twice with no one out. Â¦ Schmidt
wub relieved and then Van Haltren's
and Mohler's stupid work on the bases
spoiled it all. Score:

ture of thÂ« day. Little Plunger, won
after a sharp trial. The greyhounds
ran to the hare on even terms. The
hare favored Plunger slightly and he
secured the turn and picked up the
game.
It was decidedly a day for the talent.
as the shortenders scored in but a few
instances. The severest reversa . dur
ing the day was the defeat of Lord
Brazen by In Time. The bettors freely
laid 4 to 1 against In Time. Young
Fearless, winner of the Open Stake,
was selected yesterday by the form
players as the probable winner. Miss
Brummel had a hard trial in the sixth,
round and was withdrawn, thus giv
ing the stake to O'Shea's dog by de
fault

HUNS AND HITS BY INNINGS.
"Of course, he might not tumble right
away, but that's ail right. I says,
'These are the Tacoma Tigers, that
King Edward and the Court of St.
James are going daffy over.'
"Then, of course, he'll be wise. I'll
be polite and hand him a few conven
tional incuiries about King Ed â he
ain't a bad fellow. Then I'll ask about
my old college chums, the Duke ap
parently and unapparently, and I'll bet
I'll have him out here rooting for Ta
coma. Of course Goodman will holler
about staking him to, a pass, but I
guess we- can fix it. I err "
The gentleman, who had been roar
ing like a slaughter-house full of bulls,
sat down abruptly.
"Dat's nothing," he said in a hoarse
whisper. "I lost me voice."
Mike Fisher was the Gleeful Kid
before the fatal swat that was the start
of the finish. As usual, his head was
big enough to wear the iron circle the
Knights Temolar have hoisted above
the court of honor. After the second
inning a number 6 hat would have
been big for him.
Mique was doing his monologue just
before it came. "Did you hear about
it?" he cackled. "Me and my team is
going to be special escort for the Earl
of Euston when he comes. We march
down to the ferry in full Tacoma uni
form. I walks up to the Earl and says,
â¢These are the Tigers,' and point to the
bunch.
MIKE FISHER ORATES.
Then came Jimmie the Whale. There
was a look of hauteur and sangfroid
with a touch of pate de foie gras in
his countenance. "He looks so natur
al," said Willie Thomas, who shot them
over for the Timers.
Crack! The ball whizzed over Mr-
Laughlln's head and fractured the skull
of an Indian painted on the left field
fence. It was the cleanest two-bagger
ever made. Gorton had time to .trundle
a baby carriage to the plate. He made
it easy. Two bells for the Seals.
After that the Tigers would eat pea
nuts out of anybody's mitt. The rest
was like tamping 1 down the sod over
your mother-in-law to make sure. she
was dead. Whenever the Adonis-like
figure of Whalen posed, bat in hand,
the scorer felt like marking down a
hit to save time.
Others got two-baggers, but they
were used to them. Jimmie's two-bas
ger, while not exactly a miracle, was
a next-door neighbor, and awed the
Tacomaites.
It startled others. A young lady,
who admired the Whale at long dis
tance, was present with a gentleman
friend. Said lady had been chewing a
piece of gum steadily day and night
for sixteen years. When that first wal
lop of "Chimmie's" whizzed out the
young lady's jaws hesitated and
stopped.
"I lost me gum," she remarked plain
tively.
JIMMIE WHALE.VS TRIUMPH.
It was one apiece in the second. Rab
bit Miller got on while McLaughlin
juggled a rise. Gochnauer sacrifice!
Truck Eagan let a drive from Gorton
slide through his spokes and Miller
hopped in.
The head bookkeep in the hall of
fame is busy scratching off the names
of a few dead ones like Napoleon and
Maud S. There has to be a full page
for the name of "Chimmie the Whale,"
who made 11,000 people at Recreation
Park yesterday act like a mixture of
Democratic Convention and an Agnews
Asylum.
There ia a difference between the
Democratic gathering and a madhouse,
though everybody can't see it. J.
Whalen Esq. made the fans imitate
both at once and the result was a
delirium cocktail. The racket shook
the milk in the neighborhood into
schmierkaese, a fr # ee lunch delicacy
which is more ornamental than palat
able. The dwellings on Ringold street
trembled on their foundations, causing
a gentleman who was tasting a spoon
ful of chicken soup to insert the same
into his eye. Medical opinion is that
the unfortunate man may sprout pin
feathers in place of one eyebrow.
Aiide from this catastrophe Jlmmie's
victory caused no serious casualties.
To say Jimmie was the hero of the
day sounds flat as a bagpipe running
down.' Everybody has been called a
hero once or twice, unless he saw the
other fellow first. The Whale was it
let it bo at that.

RUNS AND HITS BY INNINGS.
I have always worked right up to the after
noon before the fight and I shall follow the
same course this time. I expect to go on the.
road In the mornin* and wjll do my Indoor
work In the afternoon. The work In the
gymnasium will consist of boxing and wrest
ling with Joe Kennedy and by brother, ex
ercise with the rope apparatus, bag punching.
skipping the rope and shadow Boxing. I Â«â¢
pected to be a little stiff after my long rest
and the trip from Harbin, but when I got
on the road I felt just as lively as If there
had been no interruption In my work. .
Champion James J. Jeffries' spent a
quiet Sunday, taking only enough exer
cise to keÂ«p from becoming stiff after
his hard training at Harbin. In the
morning the champion's only ex
ercise was a short walk around town,
the rest of the time being spent with
his wife at the hotel.
In the afternoon the big fellow start
ed out, accompanied by George Miller,
and the pair went around Lake Mcr
rltt. The champion alternated between
walking and running, varying the
slower pace with short, hard sprints.
That the big fellow is in good condition
was shown by the fact that not once
during the time he was on the road did
he draw a long breath.
On returning from the run, at 3:10 p.
m., the champion was met by John
Marcovitch and, securing a boat, he
went for a row on Lake Merritt, ac
companied by Miller and Marcovitch.
For more than an hour Jeff rowed
steadily. He returned bathed in per
spiratio-n, but without a sign of weari
ness. A sharp run to the gymnasium,
followed by a shower and a rub down,
completed the work for the day. Jeff
did not go out during the evening, but
retired early in order to be fresh for
the finishing touches of training, which
will begin at the Reliance Club this
morning.
Jeffries ha's instructed Joe Kennedy
to be on hand and this means the big
fellow will don the mitts. Regarding
the programme of his work,' Jeff said

CHICAGO.- Aug. 21. â There are a
number of good offerings for the sec
ond week's racing at Hawthorne
track. A stake race Is scheduled for
Thursday, while two are on the card
for Saturday. The feature event on
Thursday will be the Hawthorne
stakes for 3-year-old fillies.
The event has a decidedly Tokalon
appearance, Judging strictly on prev
ious form, but it is several weeks since
the flying daughter of Tammany won
*Â»- good race. It is announced that Ed
Corrigan has selected Alma Dufour to
carry" the green and white sash, while
B<jb Smith will send I^eila after the
money. .Other probable starters are
Miss Crawford, White Plume. Katy
INDwers, Miss Betty and Shawana.
The race that will doubtless appeal
to all patrons of the turf is the Su
rerior handicap at one and a half
miles, which Is elated for next Satur
day. Nearly every owner at the track
has an entry in this event and quite
a fair field can be expected to line up
Â£t the barrier. On the same day the
Emerald steeplechase over the short
course will be contested by the best
Jumpers at Hawthorne track.

Chris Meyer, -the well known cham
pion, proved his superiority despite ad
verse conditions,. carrying oft* first hon
ors in the California Schuetzen Club
with the good center of 148 points.. He
was also the victor in the pistol class
with the high scores of 90 and 87 in
his two ten shot strings.
The strong wind that whistled across
the rifle range at Schuetzen Park yes
terday kept the marksmen busy ad
justing: their sights to obtain a fine
center shot. The principal events were
the bullseye contests of the California
Schuetzen Club and the Grutli shooting
section. As no shot would be recorded
that was outside a six-inch diameter
at 200 yards, it was a difficult task for
the contestants.

The spectators at the benefit meet,
at Ingleside race course yesterday for
the athletic amphitheater in Golden
Gate Park, saw a varied card, replete
with exciting incidents, run off in snap
py style. The day was cold and blus
tering, but it did not seem to dull the
ardor of the competitors, although it
made the spectators uncomfortable.
The principal thrill came in the flve
mile motor cycle ra^e. D. Wilkie, the
scratch man, was traveling at a 1:30
gait, when he lost control of his ma
chine at the turn into the stretch. He
made an effort to keep on the inside
of the track, but failed. His machine
swerved under him and a cry of hor
ror went up from the spectators as man
and machine rolled over and over in
the dust. There was an instant's hush
a.nd then the spectators breathed easily
us they saw Wilkie stand up to take,
stock of damages. A broken pedal on
the machine and a wrenched arm for
its operator completed the list.
A. A. Glarner of the Olympic Foot
ball Club was the sensational performer
of the day. He won the 100, 220, 440
and 800 yard runs cleverly. He ran the
final of the "hundred" in 10 2-5 sec
onds from the three-yard mark. He
ran the "220" in :24 1-5 and the half
mile in 2:12.

The Presidio had a narrow escape
yesterday afternon from a destructive
fire. Only ha'rd and prompt work by
the remnant of the Twenty-eighth In
fantry left in the cantonment saved
the frame buildings known as "Offi
cers Row" and occupied by the offi
cers of that regiment from being
wiped out.
The fire started in the tall grass on
the hill back of the cantonment, be
tween the "Row" and the road lead-
Ing to the First avenue entrance to
the reservation. A lighted cigar was
probably the cause of the blaze. "Which
spread through the dry grass and ran
down the hill in the direction of the
buildings. Within a few minutes the
whole hillside was in flames.
The Presidio population is smaller
than for years, the bulk of the men
being away at Atascadero for the
maneuvers. Of the Twenty-eighth In
fantry not more than half a score out
of each company are at the canton
ment and many of these were out of
the grounds when the fire occurred.
Those who remained had their hands
full with fighting the swift fire in the
grass and protecting the officers'
homes. With brush and limbs cut
from trees they beat back the flames,
however, and kept them away from
the buildings. The fire was at last
extinguished without serious damage
to the cantonment.

Servee Anderson, a sailor, living at
46- Sacramento street, was arrested by
Patrolman C. H. Graham last evening
and locked up on a charge of assault
ing Edward Johnson, who lives at
1767 Fifteenth avenue. The men, who
are strangers to each other, were re
turning from Harbor View with a
number of -others. Near the corner
of Greenwich and Baker streets they
became involved in a battle of words,
whereupon Anderson, drawing his
knife, slashed Johnson across the
chest, making two deep wounds. In
the melee Anderson's nose was broken
and his face badly bruised. John
son was taken to the Emergency Hos

, When the ancestors have eaten their
fill the general' public does the rest.
Yesterday the chow" was so good that
even the j much revered Tauist priests
were 'â¢ overturned in the rush for the
dainties. The ancestors had very poor
appetites.
Of course everybody has an ancestor
or two who Js- likely to call. Conse
quently .feasts have been spread in
every street j and alley of Chinatown.
Tomtoms have been going and fld
dies *rtueaking through It all.
.The Chinese have a clever scheme
of getting -rid of the spirit visitors.
They burn return certificates to China
and paper clothing, which then fall
Into the hands of the shades. These
gantry don the robes, stuff ! the return
certificates Into their pockets and hike
back, to Chinsr. The worshipers make
sure that plenty of clothing is burned.
If an ancestor showed up in the flowery
land without alsuit of clothes, all the
other ghosts would give him the laugh
and the next' time he showed up he
would bring trouble.
The pious of Chinatown concluded a
series of feasts spread for their ances
tors yesterday. Unless an American
has an ancestor who slipped on Ply
mouth Hock or waited with Warren
at Bunker Hill, he has little veneration
for his' family tree. But Chinese an
cestors; must have their veneration or
there will be trouble in the home of the
descendant.
After death, according to the explan
ation of Ah Sing, a merchant of Dupont
street, the Chinese ancestor becomes a
dovll. Once a year he comes back to
earth to glance over his descendants.
He is always as hungry as a country
relation. The descendant has to jolly
him along. Seaweed stew, abalones
on the haif shell, chow yuck and all
the delicacies of the season are spread
for the wandering ghost-devil.
Sometimes other people's ancestors
are yours, too. There must be quite
a rumpus- among the devils. Two, an
cestors, for instance, approach Ah
Sing's feast.
"That's my descendant," .cries one
ancestor. "He's mine.* I saw him first,"
shouts the other. And then the two
ghosts have it out in their invisible
clement.,

A badly demolished hearse and a
pair of horses scurrying over the hills
was the result of a collision between
a suburban Mission-street car and a
hearse from the undertaking establish
ment of McFadden, McBrearty &
Green. The accident occurred yester
day afternoon on Mission street, south
of the old St. Mary's College building.
The hearse, containing the body of
Samuel T^Phipps, was going down the
hill # leading the funeral procession,
whe'n the horses became frightened at
the sound Â«f a car coming behind
them. The driver was not able to con
>trol his team, which sprang forward
and collided with another car that was
approaching from ahead.
The two vehicles came hard to
gether and the hearse was completely
wrecked. The wheels were smashed,
all the plate glass was broken and the
running gear was disabled. The
horses, breaking the pole from the
hearse, continued their run. disappear
ing down the street. Fortunately the
hearse with all its rough treatment
was not overturned and the casket it
contained was undisturbed and unin
jured. The casket was transferred to
another hearse and the procession pro
ceeeded to the cemetery.

Nevada Commandery No. 6, Thomas
Ingram eminent commander, has un
dertaken to demonstrate to the visit
ing Sir Knights that there is enough
gold left in California to sustain the
reputation of the Golden State as the
greatest producer of the precious metal
for decades still unborn. The comman
dery will have a mineral exhibit at the
Mechanics' Pavilion during conclave
week that will compensate. visitors from
distant parts for the trip irr studying
it The committee selected by the com
mandery for that duty has succeeded
NEVADA'S GOLDEN WEALTH.
One exhibit Nevada Commandery will
display, which its members "â¢ value'
greater than all the gold,' is the banner
made of all the badges used at the
conclave held in San Francisco twen
ty-one years ago, and thus contains
the souvenirs of all commanderies from
every jurisdiction throughout ' 'the
United States. The collection was made
by Mrs. Edward Coleman, wife of EnVi
nent Sir Edward Coleman, grand treas
urer of the Grand Commandery of Cal
ifornia, and by her presented to Nevada
Commandery. The badges .'are artis
tically worked on a background" of-\silk
around the center of a cross and crown
of gold. The harmonious grouping and
coloring make it a work of art, while
the. pleasant memories, of twenty-one
years ago, which twine about it, make
it the most precious of all exhibits that
-can possibly be brought to the con
clave.
NEVADA COMMANDERY.
One point to where nearly every Sir
Knight who attends the conclave will
make a pilgrimage is the Masonic
Home at Decoto. Near this institution
is erected a beautiful temple, where
aged Masons may hold their ceremo
nies. This edifice was built by Sir
Knight M. Siminoff of this city at a
cost of $28,000. .
The grand stands along the route of
parade are controlled partly by the ex
ecutive committee of the Knights
Templar of California and , by
subordinate local commanderies.
Some subordinate commanderies from
the interior of- California have
also ; had grand stands erected
for the accommodation of their friends
and families, while others are con
trolled by outside parties. Those erect-'
ed by the executive committee, five. in
number, are all on Van Ness avenue
and have an aggregate seating capac
ity of about 4500. â¢ ."
The reviewing stand, at the south
west corner of Sutter street and. Van
Ness avenue, is reserved entirely for the
Grand Encampment,, the officers of the
various Masonic grand bodies and'In
vited guests. Its seating capacity j is
only 1200, and the. apportionment.' of
seats on this stand has been assigned
to Grand Captain General Charles L.
Field. The other four stands and the
assignment of seats "thereon have, been
committed to J. K. Firth, chairman of
the committee on buildings and grand
stands. The seats are intended for the
ladles coming with visiting Sir Knights.

On the day before the Knights Tem

services will be held by the Sir Knights.
This 1b in accordance with the custom
of the Templars of old. who before
starting on a crusade bent their knees
in prayer. *
At 11 a. m. on Sunday, September 4,
the officers of the Grand Encampment
will proceed to the First Congregational
Church. They will be escorted by Gold
en Gate Commandery in full uniform.
At the church solemn and impressive

After two unsuccessful attempts the
eighteen-ton steel circle that will form
the base of the gigantic illuminated
bell at the junction of Kearny, Mar
; ket, Geary and Third streets, was
raised to position parly yesterday
! morning.' The bell will be the center
or" the main court of honor of the
Knights Templar.
Getting the massive steel structure
into the place It occupies has cost
much' trouble and labor, but it is cer
tain that the effect Avhen the lights
are turned on will be worth all the
trouble it cost. It swings on steel
cables forty feet above the street and
roaches from sidewalk to sidewalk.
This center piece proves that the illu
mination during the Knights Templar
Conclave will be grander than that at
any previous celebration or conven
tion.

Two of the other victims of the
gang- were A. Vargo, laborer from
Oakland, whose silver watch was
taken from him at Montgomery ave
nue and Broadway early Friday morn
ing and Andrew Hunker, 1695 Pacific
avenue, who was robbed of a gold
watch, valued at $150. and a few
cents on Filbert street, between
Kearny and Montgomery, early Satur
day morning.
Two of the gang suspected of com
mitting recent robberies on the Bar
bary Coast are under arrest. One of
them, Pedro Petrovitch, a " Porto
Kican, 21 years of age, has been
charged with robbery.. The other,
John Sweeney, aliate Love, 20 years of
age, is in the "tanks" at the City
Prison and will be held till some of.
the victims have had a look at him.
Petrovitch was arrested early yes
terday morning by Policemen Baku
lich and Silver. Randolph Nelson, a
sailor, told the officers that he had
been enticed to a room at 1237 Stock
ton street by a young man who told
Nelson that a young , woman wanted
to see him. When Nelson got to the
room the young man knocked him
down and robbed him of his watch
and $& in coin. From the descrip
tion the> officers suspected Petrovitch
and they went to his room at 702 Val
lejo street, where Nelson identified
him â¢ as the robber. The room was
searched and Nelson's watch was
found, also four others supposed to be
the product of other robberies.
Sweeney was arrested late Saturday
night in Washington Square Park. He
is suspected of being one of the trio
of youths who robbed Harry Peters,
an old man from Niles, in a lumber
yard at Sansome and Lombard streets
early Friday morning. Â»He met the
trio in a saloon and they told him
they would introduce him to a nice
young woman. They left the saloon
and when they reached the lumber
yard they knocked him down and rob
bed him of his watch and $37.
Sweeney has been arrested several
times. A few months ago he was
charged with grand larceny, but the
eilidence was not strong enough and
he was discharged.
