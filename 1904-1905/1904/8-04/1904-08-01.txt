General Kuroki's northern column
makes it extremely dangerous to re
main at that place, because the Japan
ese.* whose advance is necessarily al
ways slow and careful, misht push
through and cut his railway communi
cations to Liaoyang.
While nothing is definitely known,
there are some unofficial indications
that matters are maturing rapidly,
either for a batle or for a retreat. For
instance, the refusal to accept further
press teiesrams at Haicheng is shown
by the fact that one of the correspond
ents of the Associated Press had to
ride through to Mukden to file ari ac
count of the Tatchekiao fight. This
might bo construed either that prepa
rations were making for a retirement
or that the wires were very crowded,
incident to a concentration at Hai
cheng or Liaoyang. A few days are
expected to determine which course
General Kuropatkin has elected to
pursue.
ST. PETERSBURG. August Lâ The
enveloping movement of the three Jap
anese armies of Generals Kuroki, Nod
zu and Oku around General Kuropat
kln's position appears to be almost
complete and the entended line of. the
Japanese seems to be the only draw
back to concerted action. It is realized
here that the Russian general must
now either fight or withdraw the whole
army northward. He i3 being closely

FRANKFORT, Germany. July 31.â
The Tokio correspondent of the Zeit
vmz says that the Vladivostok squad
ron has returned to Vladivostok.
The police will investigate' the pos
sibility that the robbery may have
been committed by former employes,
who were discharged some time ago.
The combination of the pantry safe
is said to be known only by -the fam
ily and the butlers. The safe robbed
Saturday night was opened by some
one who knew the combination. The
thief, after -robbing the silverware
safe, made his way to an iron case
opened by a key, which was kept" in
a place also known only to the mem
bers of "the family and the butler.
From this box was- taken the remain
ing silverware.
The bedrooms on the second floor
were next ransacked and several valu
able articles of jewelry taken. When
the thieves had finished their exit was
made through the front door, by which
they entered, using a key.
At the time of the robbery Mrs. Par
rott was. alone in the house save fpr
the presence of her maid and the but
ler. The butler sleeps in the room next
to the pantry, where the safe is kept,
and the police wonder that he did not
hear the burglars at work. He says he
heara nothing, though his statement Is
questioned by other employes about the
place. . .
A close watch will be kept by the po
lice on the pawnshops of the city with
a hope of recovering some of the stolen
jewelry. They do not expect to recover
the silverware, as they believe that It
will be melted by the burglars before
it is disposed of.
Mrs. Parrott, If she is able, intends
to come to the city to-day to confer
with Captain Martin and give him what
clews she may have.
The members of the Parrott family
are very reticent regarding the rob
bery*, and do n<3t wish the facts made
public.
Mrs. A. H. Payson, Mrs. Parrott's
daughter. Who occupies a home ad
joining her mother's; says that the el
der lady is in a serious condition
through nervousness over the theft.
Mrs. Parrott. who is- now over 80
years old, is nearly. prostrated from the
shock. She has been suffering of late
from nervous prostration and the rob
bery has totally unnerved her. Last
night a guard was. placed around her
house and no one allowed to enter.
Mrs. Parrott was immediately in
formed of the theft and a hurried ex
amination showed that the house had
been ransacked from top to bottom,
everything of value being taken. Sev
eral large and expensive silver sets, all
of that ware owned by Mrs. Parrott,
were gone. The loss of one of the sets.
known as the reserve set, valued at
$2500, and used only on state occasions,
is keenly felt by Mrs. Parrott. This set
was, a .present from husband .be
fore his death and was highly treas
ured.
The residence of Mrs. Abbie M. Par
rott at San Mateo was robbed on Sat
urday night of jewels and silverware
valued at $10,000. The matter was keot
a strict secret and only leaked out late
last night.
Captain Martin of the city detective
force was notified and detectives have
been detailed on the case. The bur
glary was a daring one and the perpe
trators have so far successfully cov
ered their tracks. The police here are
confident that the job was done by
some one who was thoroughly familiar
with the Parrott residence.
The theft of the valuables was first
discovered by Mrs. Parrott's butler,
who went to the safe yesterday morn
ing to get out silverware for the Sun
day dinner. The safe, which is kept
in the pantry, was empty* although the
door at the time the butler went to it
w'as locked.
"Last 'Tuesday at noon I was in

n;e. uhen -a man rode up on horse
bac:k and to'd me I .was wanted in
Winnipeg. I told him they would
have a pood 'time getting me there
until- 1 got orders from headquarters
to report. At that he pulled a revolver
ar.d showed me a star and said I waa
under arrest. On the way to Winnipeg
the officer gaid that I would be j de
ported. He said there were tpo many
Americans there now holding down
pood jobs that belonged to Canadians
ar.d that we would all have to go. And,
tÂ«> cut the' story short, here I am. Sev
eral hundred Americans employed as
I was are being deported as fast' as
arrests can be made." Â¦
Last night there arrived from Winni
peg one of the most prominent engi
neers of the West, a man who was
for years engaged in locating routes
lor the Great Northern and Northern
Pacific companies. He requested that
hip name be withheld, but told his
story as follows:
"i went to Winnipeg some time ago
Â«3d took charge of a - construction
s-n? on the Canadian Northern. We
v. tit Working about 200 miles west of
Winnipeg and rumors had reached us
ih<u thi. Canadians were dissatisfied
with the conditions, there being so
many Americans in charge of various
ope: aiiuns. I had heard of the trouble
th* <Jri.nd Trunk was having, and how
severa! American engineers were de
ported, but had thought the stories
wcr-j > xaggerated. I had a tip some
time ago that I perhaps would be re
quested to leave, but 1 paid no atten

ST. PAUL. July 31. â The Canadian
Government is deporting all civil engi

contractor of Canada said yesterday:
"We can afford to pay the highest
salaries to American engineers, for one
of them is worth four of the Canadian
engineers. For this reason no Ameri

ST. PETERSBURG, July 31.âLieu
tenant General Sakharoff, in a dis
patch to the general staff dated July
30, reports that "there has been no
change In the front of the Manchurian
army up to midday to-day.' The Jap
anese are coventrating: strongly on
our southern front."
General Sakharoff then refers to
General Oku's account of the battle of
Tatchekiao and declares that the Rus
sian forces were not as large as Gen
eral Oku represented, adding:
"Our position was oqcupied solely
with a view of keeping the enemy in
check and with no idea of obstinately
defending it. We did not throw up
any special defenses. We held all our
positions against the Japanese attacks
and then retired because the com
manding officer did not deem it possi
ble to .accept battle the following
morning while defending a position
with a front ten miles in length. The
evacuation of our position, was a com
plete surprise to the Japanese."
Sakharoff Denies Oku's Claim of a
Victory at Tatchekiao.
NOT FORCED TO RETREAT.
The rioters, being reinforced by
several hundred of their friends, re
turned later to renew the attackâ A
riot call was sent in, but before the
patrol wagon with a squad of police
men had arrived the saloon had been
partially wrecked. It was necessary
for the police to fire a volley over the
heads of the rioters before they de
sisted vin their attack on the place.
With the exception of bruises and
scratches no one was seriously hurt.
CHICAGO, July 31. â The police and
a mob of strike sympathizers clashed
ir. the vicinity of the stockyards to
night. Two non-union men had entered
a saloon and asked for a drink when
strike sympathizers protested against
the bartender serving them. Several
policemen succeeded in ejecting the
attacking men and the doors were
barricaded.

j BOSTON, July 31. â Hon. Desmond
Fitzgerald of Boston, special United
States commissioner to the Philippines,
has just returned from the Orient and
gives the result of his observations
while in Japan and China. He fore
sees danger to the world In Japan's de
feat of Russia and says:
"While I can but admire these won
derful people, it seems to me that it
will one day require great concerted
action by the white nations to check
their aggressions, because of their in
satiable ambition. I have heard it
said in Japan that they will build up
an army and navy to conquer the
whole world. It is not so much the
yellow peril as that Japan is becoming
sufficiently strong to drive out the
white man. It seems to be there is
more to fear from Japan than from
Russia. All Asiatic nations (the
Japanese are no exception) have a
deep-seated hatred of the White man
and want him driven out. Even now
the Japanese have a very bad attack
of 'swelled head' and it is not at all
improbable that this country, sooner
or later, will have trouble with
Japan."
Desmond Fitzgerald Says Japanese
Hope to Conquer the World.

Among to-day's arrivals were many

since the strike started.
CHICAGO. July 31. â Both the
packers and the strikers spent Sun
day in strengthening weak spots in
their defenses, preparatory to another
week of effort to bring their oppo
nents to terms. All the plants were
operated during the forenoon in order
to get rid of the live stock that had
been left over from last week. The
remainder of the day was spent by
the employers in installing new men
and arranging many of the small de
tails that had been overlooked last
week. More than 1000 new men were
added to the number already at work
in the different plants.

STRENGTHENING DEFENSES.
The commander of the Japanese
liner, says he, has 'no fears that
his vessel will fall a prey to the
Vladivostok fleet. He says, the
three cruisersâ Ruric, Rossiay and
Gromoboiâ of the fleet are eighteen and
twenty-knot ships according to their
trial test, but the actual sailing speed
cannot be over sixteen even under the
most favorable conditions. In their
present condition those vessels un
doubtedly are badly in need of a season
In the drydock, and probably need to
have their coal-bunkers refilled. If
such is the case fifteen knots is about
the limit of their speed.
The America Maru, on the other
hand, says Captain Going, is clean,
her bottom is coated with anti
foullng paint, her bunkers' are filled
with excellent fuel, and if she gets
a good start she can run away
from the Russians. During the recent
trial trip, ordered by the Japanese
Government for the America Maru,
Hongkong Maru and Nippon Maru,
on the renewal of the Government sub
sidy, th<t America Maru made 18%
knots for four consecutive hours. And
this after slx^ycars of trans-Pacific
travel, gha -used 1 : only ordinary coal
during the run. The course laid out
was. full of sharp turns, as the Gov
ernment desired to severely test her
ability to get away when the Russian
cruisers came down to cut out the
commerce of Japan.
The only thing the fleet liner has to
fear is getting under the Russian guns
in a fog. But this is not the foggy sea
son on that coast and Captain Going
expects to have clear days and nights
when he reaches the danger-zone.
However, there will be no sleeping on
watch when the America Maru draws
near home on or about the 16th of this
month.
The Japanese steamship America
Maru will sail for the Orient thia af
ternoon at 1 o'clock even if the way Is
crowded, with .Vladivostok squadrons.
Her commander says she is able
to make eighteen or nineteen knots and
will take her chances in a j race with
the Russians if 'they are still on the
outlook for her. There is only one
thing that will delay her start, he says,
and that Is fresh consignments of
freight. The Pacific Mail and Occiden
tal and Oriental companies have re
fused to carry goods, contraband or
otherwise, to Asiatic ports for the pres
ent, and the fleet Toyo Kisen Kaisha
craft hopes that the disappointed ship
pers will be at the Greenwich-street
dock early this morning with their
consignments. - At present there are
2500 tons of freight aboard and she can
take on almost as much more.
The America Maru, which is sched
uled, to sail to-day, expects to. make
Honolulu at noon August 6. She Is to
sail the same day and will not call at
the Midway Islands, but go direct to
Yokohama, reaching that port about
August 16.
While' no definite Information is ob
tainable, the report that the fortress Is
short of ammunition is considered by
the public as the most disquieting fea
ture of the situation.
CHEFU, July 31.â^A Japanese.mer
chant has received word from a Chi
nese whom he trusts to the effect that
the Japanese have occupied every po
sition surrounding the besieged fort
ress of Port Arthur, with the excep
tion of Golden Hill. The Chinese said
that both sides suffered " tremendous
losses in the operations necessary to
.bring about this condition. The mem
bers of the Russian intelligence bu
reau here are inclined to believe the
report true to the extent that the Jap
anese have made great progress in
their operations about the besieged
fortress.
LONDON. Aug. 1.â The Tokip corre
spondent of the Times sends a pub
lished reply of the Port Arthur garri
son to the Japanese summons to sur
render. This reply shows that the gar
rison is under the impression that Field
Marshal Oyama and all his staff were
sunk with the transports Hatachi and
Sado and that the Russians wholly
disbelieve that General Kuropatkin has
ever been defeated.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 1.â There is
no inclination here to doubt that there
may have been pretty severe fighting
at the outer positions of Port Arthur,
possibly accompanied by a bombard
ment from the fcea, but It is not be
lieved that the Japanese are yet ready
to storm the fortress.
Rear Admiral Withoft, in command
of the naval forces at Port' Arthur, Is
relied upon to put to sea if the condi

Immigration into the packing town
began in 1SS5,* when the packing in
dustry was in its infancy. With sub
sequent immigrations the Union Stock
yards and Transit Company has grown
until it is now the largest industrial
organization of its kind in America.
The unskilled foreigners were wel
comed by the packers. They were more
docile than the native-born and were
less capable of organization. Once an
idea was in their heads they worked
mechanically, uncomplainingly. And
they were willing to work for 15 cents
an hour.
CHICAGO, July 31,â Of the 20,000
striking meat butchers at the Union
stockyards more than 15,000 are of for
eign birth. Twelve thousand of these
are unskilled laborers. Their wages, at
the minimum of 17% cents per hour,
average ?7 40 a week. Single men live
on less than $2 a week, and in two
years save sufficient money for passage
home. Three thousand leave for home
every year and their places are filled
by other immigrants. Few can speak
English. There are only 2000 voters In
the colony, and a great many of them
do not intend to become Americanized.
The foreign colony includes Bohemians,
Poles, Lithuanians and Slovaks. Their
settlement j 3 virtually a city of all na
tionalities. The 20,000 men under con
sideration do not include the 12.000 sym
pathetic strikers of the allied trades.
While most of the skilled laborers are
native-born, a number of early Immi
grants have attained to higher posi
tions. The great bulk of the laborers
take orders from their bosses with the
obedience of soldiers. It is not their
part to reason why. Their English
vocabulary may be limited, but they
understand an oath, and the stockyards
has a language of its own.

The failure in the United States to
make as good a showing in rapidity of
construction as compared with -Ger
many is chiefly due to the dissensions
in the board of construction in Wash
ington, resulting in a delay of two
years in agreeing upon the designs of
three battleships and three armored
cruisers, authorized March 3, 1899, but
which were not contracted for until two
years later. â¢ Again, between March,
1901, and November, 1903, further de
lays were caused by radically changing
the designs of ships already contracted
for. as well as those of two battleships
and glx armored cruisers authorized in
June. 1900. The errors of the board of
construction of 1901-03 are now being
corrected at a great cost of time and
money, but there has been a loss of two
years which cannot be made good and
Â¦which is not chargeable to dilatory con
tractors. The present seeming inferior
ity of the American fleet as compared
with that of Germany is therefore not
due to lack of money or want of desire
to possess a navy, but is to be at
tributed to the obstructionists In the
board of construction.
The modern navies of Germany and
the United States date nearly alike,
but the building of the German war
fchips has been done with better sys
tem and greater dispatch than in the
United States. Since 1890 Germany has
completed fourteen battleships, four
nj-more^ cruisers, six coast-defensa
Ehtps**ahd thirty-flve cruisers and gun
boats. During the same period we have
built and completed twelve battleships,
two armored cruisers, five coast-de
fense chips and thirty-two cruisers and
grunboats. There is but a slight differ
ence in the number of armored ves
sels, but the type and tonnage of Ger
man cruisers far exceed that of the
United States. The prospects for two
years hence are, however, more favora
ble, as the armored vessels under con
struction in American yards greatly
exceed those building in Germany. In
'.he latter country eight battleships and
three armored cruisers are likely to be
completed by January, 1906, while the
United States navy will be increased
in that period by nine battleships and
nine armored cruisers.

The Iowa is the only one of its class
in our navy, and carries four 12-inch,
eight 8-inch and six 4-inch guns. The
Ivearsarge, Alabama, and Illinois are

turrets, has four 13-inch, four 8-inch

four fe-inch and ten 5- inch guns; the

ten 5-inch and the Mayflower, which is
a converted yacht, carries twelve 6

tvu of the American battleships are
"Sued with submerged torpedo tubes â
vfce Maine and Missouri having two
each. The other four have four above
water tubes, but none of the cruisers
are fitted with torpedo tubes. None of
the battleships have triple screws, and

Cleveland, which have water-tube boil
ers.

The German squadron, which arrived
at Plymouth July 10. was composed of
elcht battleships, two armored cruisers.
Eix cruisers and two dispatch boats,
a total of eighteen vessels, with a dis
placement tonnage of about 219,000. i
The arrival of this fleet was witnessed :
by thousands of spectators, and the
precision with which the ships kept
their position In their division, fault
lessly keeping station and wheeling
with the precision of trained soldiers,
was favorably commented upon as a
line exhibition of good training;. In an
hour from the time the llrst division
or" battleships had arrived all the ships
were at rest at their buoys or at an
chor. The most striking feature about
this squadron is its homogeneity. Four
of the battleships, of the Kaiser class,
differed but slightly in size from the
Wittelsbaeh, but all have the same
speed, eighteen knots, and carry the i
same armament, namely: four 9.4-inch ,
cr.d eighteen 5.9-inch guns and six tor
pedo tubes, five of the latter being sub
merged. 'The armored cruiser Prinz
Heinrich carries two 9.4-lnch, ten 5.9- j
ir.ch puns and the Prinz Friedrich
Karl, four S.2-inch and ten 5.9-inch guns,
and these cruisers have also four tor- j
pedo tubes, three under water. The six \
cruisers have each a battery of ten
U-lach guns and are fitted with two ,
submerged torpedo tubes. The battle- |
thips and armored cruisers each have j
triple screws and their boilers are two- j
fifths cylindrical and three-fifths of the ;
water-tube type. The boilers in the j
cruisers are Thorneycroft-Durr water- i
tube. Thus all the ships, being prac- !
tieally new. have all the improvements
In naval design which, with the uni- |
formity of the several classes, make
this squadron so much more formidable
than it would be if composed of a
larger number of ships varying in speed
and essential details.

LOS ANGELES, July 81.â In the
work of building Senator dark's new
railway across the desert between Los
Angeles and Salt Lake the contractors
are confronted with difficulties,- the
equal of which was not encountered
by those who built the other transcon
tinental lli.-es.
W. R. Boyce, an engineer in the em
ploy of a Hyndlcate of the New York
mine owners, arrived to-day from a
trip alor>jj the line of the Salt Lake
railroad. He 8%ys the engineers have
just completed a stretch of track across
that startling natural freak known as
the "Devil's Playground," one of the
worst pieces of land in the whole
country to cover.
"A lost railroad may seem a strange
quantity, but this is just the term to
apply to the Salt Lake tracks before
measures were taken to prevent their
.burying," said Boyce. "This Devil's
Playground is a vast stretch oV fine
white sand, smoothed out with scarce
ly a ripple marring its surface. It is
apparently of sufficient solidity to ad
mit of railway construction. Night
may come on and bring with it a wind,
and lo, what was once a vast flat mesa
is in the morning a hilly section of
ridges and valleys, with tumbling'
white mounds that shut off and distort
the vision. <>-
"Sometimes the Salt . Lake ' tracks
have been burled to the depth of sev
eral feet, and no snow-plow, blower or.
similar device has been sufficient to get
them clean, again. Nothing but hard,
patient digging with men-driven shov
els has done the work.
"Another peculiar feature is that the
subtle eddying currents have- actually
undermined the road, driving out all
the sand ballast, heaping it up in drifts
far to the other side and leaving the
track line bent, with its pendant cross
ties hanging In empty air.
"The company will doubtless find the
playground a constant annoyance, bat
the shifting way has been crossed now

ST. PETERSBURG, July 31.â M. von
Plehwe, the Minister of the Interior
who was assassinated on ThursÂ«lay
morning last, was buried to-day, and
in every city and hamlet of this vast
empire church bells were tolled and
masses and prayers said for the repose
of the soul of the murdered Minister.
The services here, which were ac
cording to the rites of the orthodox
church, .were of an impressive and im
posing character. At 11 o'clock this
morning high mass was said In the
etuiely chapel adjoining the Ministry
of the Interior. Emperor Nicholas and
the Dowager Empress stood with the
broken-hearted widow and the children
of the Minister at the foot of a great
mound of flowers, on which rested the
casket. To the right, on gold-embro:d
ered cushions; before a mass of wreaths
banked to the celling:, were ranged the
decorations which had been won by the
statesman during his notable career.
To the left were the metropolitan of
St. Petersburg and the officiating bish
opq and priests, in their gold-emblaz
oned vestments. A screen pf flowers
concealed S the famous imperial choir.
BEREAVED WIDOW FAINTS.
The entire assemblage was in full
uniform and on the arm of each one
present. was a badge of mourning:. All
held , lighted tapers throughout the
service, and the air was heavy with
the perfume of flowers and incense
from the censors.
At the most solemn moment, when
all knelt and many were affected by
tears, the widow was overcome and
fa'nted. The Emperor came to her as
eibtance and she was carried out by
gentle hands.
The Emperor was visibly, moved, and
upon the conclusion of the' mass he fol
lowed the casket, which was taken
upon the shoulders of the . Ministers
and borne down the broad marble
staircase to the street. There the
funeral procession was formed and the
body was placed in a great white open
hearse drawn by six coal black horses,
which were blanketed from their ears
to their tails in somber trappings.
A black- garbed groom stood at each
bridle anQ in advance went sixteen sim
ilarly cla'd lantern-bearers. Behind the
hearse walked the members of the
Minister's family and then came a long
and distinguished body of mourners, it
being the Russian custom to follow the
dead to the grave on foot. The Em
peror himself walked a short distance,
but as the Novodevicky monastery,
where the burial took place, was more
than five miles away, and also because
of the condition of the Empress, his
Majesty soon entered his carriage and
returned to the Peterhof Palace.
FLOWER IiADEX CHARIOTS.
At the end of the procession came
four white chariots filled with the floral
offerings. The cortege proceeded slowly
through the avenues and streets, pre
ceded by a squad of mounted police

WIDE SCOPE OF PLOT.
Von Plehwe's Death Planned fov An
archists in Vienna and" Paris.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 31. â The
murderer of Von Plehwe has been
removed from the hospital to the
Wyborgsky prison. The police knew
the alias under which he traveled, but
say they are not yet satisfied regard
ing his identity and decline to reveal
the alias on the ground that it might
defeat the ends of justice. <
There is^ no longer any doubt that
the police for some time have had
knowledge,of the existence of a plot by
a band of international anarchists - in
Paris and Vienna.- The leading con
spirator, it is said, was a man whom
the Russian Government tried to ex
tradite from Paris last fall. Some of
these conspirators arrived here a week
ago and the police believed that all. of
them had been taken into custody.
EL PASO, July 31.â The Rock Island
passenger train which left El Paso Sat
urday morning northbound, was held
up Saturday night at 11 o'clock at Lo
gan, N. M., a station thirty miles
north of Tucumcari j and ninety miles
north of Santa Rosa, the division point.
Seven masked robbers boarded the
train just as it waa moving out of
Logan, uncoupled the baggage and ex
press cars and went on with the en
gine. Conductor John York resisted
and was shot in the leg. The train
was run ahead a short distance when
it was stopped and* dynamite applied.
The small safe was placed on top of
the large one with dynamite between
thev two. The charge was fired, but the
only effect was to blow the small safe
through the roof of the car, the larger
one not being injured. The small saje
was replaced and a second charge of dy
namite put between the two safes with
the same result except that the small
safe this time was blown through the
side of the car. The robbers then
mounted their horses and rode away in
the darkness. >"?â¢:. :
Officers were advised this morning of
the hold-up and are on the trail of the
men who are believed to be the "Evans
gang." The passengers were not mo
lested by the robbers and many did not
know the robbery was in progress, as
most of them were asleep. Owing to
the remoteness of Logan, the details of
the hold-up were not obtained until
to-night when a southbound Rock
Island passenger train arrived here.
The Wells-Fargo officials say there
was only seven dollars in the safe
when it left here. ; : Â¦

When it is completed the new drive
will form a connecting link between
the west side of Lake Merritt and
Pleasant Valley. It will also reach
within easy distance of the proposed
park site on the Sather tract, which
runs along the eastern line of Pleasant
Valley road.
The new electric line will terminate
at the east side for the present at the
Pleasant Valley road. If the bonds are
voted for the purchase of the Sather
tract it is proposed to extend the line
to the park entrance.
In marking the lines of the boulevard
the Adams people have taken the iden
tical course that would have been the
northern limit of the sixty-two-acre
tract they offered five years ago to'sell
to the city for a public park. At a spe
cial election the project was defeated
by a small ' vote. . The land includes
nearly all of that which has been used
as a golf links by the Oakland Golf
Club.
The railroad company will press the
work of construction rapidly. The pro
jectors hope that in sixty days they can
begin tracklaying, and that before the
winter rains, come on cars will be in
operation.
In fixing the route for the Webster
Street and Park Railroad the franchise
called for a line running through the
heart of the business district, but that
has been abandoned under an agree
ment with the Oakland Transit Consol
idated. Transfer privileges have been
arranged, so that' the new line will have
its western terminus at Fourteenth
street and Broadway.
Plans for the new electric road show
that it will run along the fine boulevard
that will cut the Adams holdings north
of Lake Merritt in half. The drive will
begin at Boulevard terrace on the west,
running a short distance northeast and
then straight across the rolling land to
a point where Pleasant Valley avenue
touches the eastern boundary of the
Adams property. The boulevard will
be 110 feet wide. This will allow ample
room on each side of the double stand
ard gauge tracks that will occupy the
center of the thoroughfare. The boule
vard will be constructed on the modern
lines of street making.
The Webster Street and Park Elec
tric. Railroad is a certainty. Work will
begin this week on the grading across
Adams Point for the boulevard through
which the line will be built. Early this
morning the E. B..& A: L. Stone Com
pany, the contractors, began to move a
Eixty-flve-ton steam shovel and equip
ment over temporary tracks from the
steam railroad terminus at Thirteenth
and Webster streets. The outfit will be
taken to the Adams property under its
own steam.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, July 31.
But Miss Boeddiker made a grave
strategical mistake when she arrived in
Berkeley again by getting off at the
wrong station. Up to this point her de
signs against the railroads had worked
out wonderfully well, but getting off at
the wrong station upset all plans. She
was completely bewildered when she
found herself in unfamiliar surround
ings at Berryman station, in North
Berkeley. She was still confident, how
ever, and did not cry or appeal to any
body for guidance. No; she struck out
down the first road she came to," which
she followed for. two miles before any
thing happened. The happening was a
railroad track in West Berkeley that
she mistook for the Key Route track.
This she set out follow, but instead
of coming toward Berkeley " she went
toward New York.
After long walking. the small pedes
trian found herself growing very tired.
Soon she could go no farther. It. was
dark, too.' So she. lay down on the side
of the road and went to sleep. '. And
there she was found late in the evening
by a man who happened to be passing
and who -took her to his home and kept
her all night. . â¢.
In the meantime the Boeddiker fam
ily had become almost distracted over
the disappearance of the vain but pre
cocious pet of the household, j They
searched everywhere; they notified the
police of the two citle3 and . the police
searched.. But all the searching was of
no avail until the girl was returned to
her home this morning by the man who
had' found her in slumber. He had
waited until morning to tell the police
of his find.
The young traveler is very penitent
this mornjng because she caused so
much trouble, and promises- never to
run away again until 1 she gets another
pair of shoes. The little lady is the
daughter of G. C. Boeddiker of 2011
Bancroft way. . . < Â¦Â¦â¢
The trip across the bay was eminent
ly satisfying to the small Miss Boed
diker's pardonable vanity. Everybody
who cared to see., and some who didn't,
looked upon those new shoes on her lit
tle feet. The patent leather tips were
particularly astonishing to the natives,
and a general invitation was extended
to all to gaze upon their attractions.
Even the buttons, were something to
marvel over, and some passengers lost
their breath in astonishment.
Miss Boeddiker returned from the
city on the Southern Pacific train, hav
ing visions of new fields to conquer.
The entire trip was spent in exhibiting
those new shoes and explaining their
shapeliness and texture and accoutre
ments.
The wonder of it all was that none of
the passengers suspected that little
Miss Boeddiker was a wanderer. Every
body reasoned that she belonged to
somebody else. Conductors never
thought of asking for the fare, and the
adventurous little maid succeeded in
practicing a fraud upon two great cor
porations. >
i BERKELEY. July 31.â Edith Boed
diker, 5 years of age, got a new p"air of
shoes yesterday, and she wanted every
body in the world to see them. She
thought that all the people in the world
crossed the bay every day on the Key
Route train, bo she boarded the first
one out of Berkeley station San Fran
cisco bound.

Priestly .had been drinking heavily
for several days. His tipple was ab
sinthe. It is supposed that he was
despondent through the effect of the
liquor. He has not been engaged in
any special employment. He i3 known
about Fitchburg and Elmhurst as a
town character. Besides his wife, there
are three daughters and two sons, all
adults.
John Priestly, 60 years old. a resident
of Fitcbbursr, tried to commit suicide
at 10 o'clock this morning at his home
by shooting himself in the hesid.
Priestly arranged a mirror in the bath
room so he could see what he was
doing. Standing in front of the glass,
he placed the muzzle of a pistol in his
mouth and pulled the trigger. The
bullet plowed, through the roof of his
mouth into his brain and made an
exit out of the top of his head.
Priestly fell into the bathtub. There
he was found by Constable Henry
Cramer, who was called from next
door by Mrs. Priestly when she heard
the shot. Cramer helped to get the
wounded man to bed and sent for Dr.
J. H. Callen and Dr. Lynch. The sur
geons, after attending the patient, said
there was a chance that Priestly would
recover, despite the fact that the bul
let had passed through the brain. The
wound, they thought, would not prov<Â»
fatal, unless a serious hemorrhage
should ensue.

â¢While he was engaged in the job the

had ruined all of Mrs. Larsen's effects.

Mrs. K. Larsen of 419 Sixth street.' .Vv; I
Scott in' htÂ» malicious tour made. a.
wreck ot Mrs. Larson's apartments.
She was absent and the visitor had fall,"
swing, until Howard Larsen* the wom
an's eleven-year-old sen. terror-strick
en, ran from the house and surriraoned
Policemen Sherry and McSc-rley, who
arrested Scott while he was busy cut- I
ting up French heeled e>Â«oes. The
rooms were strewn with the remains of
ornaments and glassware that the de
structive caller had swept off side- I
board, mantels and whatnots. In the
kitehjen stove were the smolderingrem
nants of silk dresses and lingerie that
Scott had destroyed by setting .them
afiie after . saturating the garments
with kerosene.
Mrs. 'Larsen's . wardrobe had ' been
hauled out of the closets and indis
criminately ripped to pieces or thrown
into the flames. Big picture hats, win
ter bonnets and summer straws all
went the same road. Scott tore the
dainty creations into shreds and threw
the pieces on the floor. Ribbons .and
flounces in abundance, delights of my
lady's toilet, were ripped ihto small
bits.
And of his vandalism Scott had only
to say: .
"I paid for this stuff and I guess I
can do what I like with it."
That was not satisfactory to the po
lice, so they sent him to the City j
Prison. ;
"I spent $2600 on that woman," de- i
dared Scott, when he was arrested. '
"and this stuff .is where some of :uy
money went.
"If she wants to prosecute me, she
can. I am willing to stand it."
The police said Scott had called at
the house late .this afternoon, and had
lounged around until he saw Mrs. Lar
sen depart in company with another
man. Scott had been a friend of the
woman's, and he became enraged to. see
her^walking with the other man. As
soon as she had disappeared Scott
went to the rooms and started on his
mission of destruction.
Oakland Office San Francisco Calf,

When Sargent showed the police into
his room he told them he had decided
to surrender, Pickett and Cope talked
the matter over with Sargent and his
mother for awhile and then the three
men started for the open. The officers
did not handcuff their prisoner, as they
did not suspect that he would attempt
escape.
Sargent was frightened by the blus
ter of the officers, however, and as
soon as he got outside the door he dash
de for liberty. It was so dark that Pic
kett and Cope could not use the pistols.
They searched the neighborhood for
a while but not finding the prisoner,
returned to tell Mrs. Sargent what had
happened.
"My boy would not have run aw.ay if
?he officers had not frightened him by
their talk,'* Mrs. Sargent, said to-day.
"They threatened him one time and
placated him the next, and I've no
doubt worked on his mind so that he
lost his senses for the moment. The
poor boy is not to blame for this. There
is something wrong with him. I've
noticed it for a long time. He
has been growing weaker all the time
lately. I am sure he would not have
disgraced himself if he had been sane.
He was hurt In a- football game once
and I think this i3 the result of it.'
"When I saw him last night he con
fessed everything to me. 'Mother.* he
said, 'I didn't mean tp steal anything.
Something forced me to do it. .1 must
be crazy. If they wjll give me a show
I will make myself one of Berkeley's
most respected citizens.' It Is a great
blow to me and. I don't know how It
will all end. w
Sargent has been a graduate student
at the University of California since
the beginning of the year, seeking a
master's degree In the college of natur
al sciences. He was graduated from
the University of Oregon last year, but
had also attended Pullman College In
Wyoming and the University of Wash
ington. Through all his college career
he earned his way, working as a car
penter and. miner. Upon coming to
Berkeley he purchased out of his sav
ings the house at 1625 Leroy avenue.
The upper part he rented, reserving the
basement for the use of his mother and
himself, though most of the time he
lived alone because hfa mother was
employed in San Francisco. His neigh
bors say he was a hard-working young
man, who was always employed about
his house. He is 25 years old.
The stolen articles were all piled in
big dry goods boxes in the basement
of Sargent's house. The exhibit indi
cates that Sargent gathered the articles
simply to gratify a mania to get some
thing for nothing, not because he was
a criminal at heart or thought to en
rich himself by selling them.
While the search of Sargent's house
was going on Sargent gave the officers
the slip. As he wore neither coat nor
hat and did not appear alarmed at
their approach the officers neglected to
set anv watch on him, and he escaped.
The officers laid in wait for him last
night. Deputy Marshal Pickett and Of
ficer . Reginald Cope were detailed on
the case, and Pickett, chagrined, over
the afternoon's developments, deter
mined to capture Sargent.
"I'll get him dead or alive," said
Pickett down town last night.
The calculations of the police mis
carried again, however, as the everits
of the night show. Pickett and Cope
saw Sargent going into his house about
10 o'clock, and they prepared to cap
ture him. It was all smooth sailing for
them, because Sargent .had already
confessed to his mother and agreed to
give himself up without any trouble.
GIVES POLICE SLIP.
When Sargent was traced to 1625 Le
roy avenue preparations were made to
apprehend him and search his house.
The warrant was read to him while he
worked in his garden yesterday after
noon, Deputy Marshals Howard and
Pickett and DalleruD being present.
Search of the house revealed all of the
goods stolen from Dallerup, besides a
number of things that must have, be
longed to other people.
Among the articles recovered by Dal
lerup were three watches, a number of
pieces of jewelry, one suit of clothes, a
Knight Templar uniform and many
other garments. A case in which Dalle
rup used to hold some valuable Masonic
papers was also, found, but the papers
were missing, though Sargent could
not have had any use for them.
TRIVIAL THEITS.
Kverything about Sargent's life of
late points to a sudden mental derance
ment as the cause of his duality. His
mother and his neighbors bear witness
to the inexplicable actions of the vouns
man. He .has been acting queerly for
three months, and has not been the ro
bust man of former years. His seems
to be a case of kleptomania, developed
from being injured on the head while
playing football with his college team.
There is no other way to account for
his strange conduct. The thinss he
stole were of little use to himself: they
could not be sold and he has not at
tempted to sell them.
Sargent is the man the police have
been watching for a week, because they
suspected him of raiding the house of
Benjamin Dallerup of 1615 Prince street,
where he has worked at odd hours
as a carpenter, earning money to help
him through college. Â¦ So cunnine were
his movements that it required the po
lice almost a week to find his home.
â¢. lly day he was an ambitious student
at the University cÂ£ California: by
night a plunderer of : his employer's
propertyâ a case, for. psychologists, ~n

The season for deer hvnUns h&ving
advanced arace, the hunters hu'"e id
\ am.ed several oaees into the moun
tains back of Livermore for the purpose
cf driving the game into the open ar.4
vithin tance of their guns. This pre
sages a clash between the banters anÂ«l
the Stockmen's Protective Association,
Â¦v.hich has undertaken to protect- the
ranges from the hunters and fire. â¢ "2 he
stockmen have ordered the hunters out
of the hills, and the hunters have re
futed to go. The people of the Liver
more Valley are now anxiously waiting
t<; see which side will make the first
move.
The Stockmen's Protective Associa
tion was organized about two months
ego, but the necessity for its existence
was not very great until the open sea
eon for deer began, on July 15. Then
began the attack <<t the hunters upon
the game in the mountain fastnesses
pouth of Livermore in open defiance of
the orders of the stockmen. These or
ders were announced by the stockmen
about two months ago, were published
in all papers and thousands of printed
notices on cloth have been nailed on
every tree and fence post in the hunt
ing district. These notices read as fol
lows:
NOTICE !
Having Buffered creat loss from fire on our
ranges in recent years, the members of the
undersigned aKSOclatlon have been compelled
io forbid ireepasslnc. camping, hunting and
btarting cf f.re en these premises and on ail
jToperty owntd. leased and controlled by Said
members. an<3 henceforth all offenders will be
rigorously prosecuted to the full extent of the
law.
This notice will be operatic* between May 16
and November 1 of each year.
A reward of 5^0 is hereby offered for any
ir.formttion leading to the arrest and convic
tion cf any i>erson or persons violating thr
above notice.
Dated May 15. 190*.
J-TOCKME.VS PROTECTIVE ASSOCIATION.
Then follows a long list of members,
including John McGlinchy, president;
J.- J. Callaghan, secretary;. William
Schluter, treasurer, and many others.
This notice offers its own argument,
and it truly says that a great many
disastrous fires have been started
through the carelessness of hunters in
the dry fields at this time of the year.
But there are many people both inside
and outside of Livermore who have
been in the habit of taking a run into
the canyons and hills for a few days
of busting, and who have taken this
as g,*t \Jtack upon what they deemed
iS W9SS *.p s in the mountains. As yet
Tfvtland...; rs have not attempted an or
Â£u.niÂ»w*r on, though many have urged
this faÂ»cp. They have contented them
selves with tearing down the notices
wherever found, disregarding the or
ders and showing their opposition by
ehooting the notices full of holes.
The Livermore hills are full of good
game this season a.id to be thus ruled
off of land that they before traversed
at will, and that in an unusually good
year, is particularly disagreeable to the
rimrods. They have defied at the
Stockmen's Protective Association,
though not in an organized way, and as
the season grows older the danger of
a clash .will oecome greater. The Liver
more district is greatly interested in
this corjiesi., for on one side the town
derives great urofit from its stock in
dustry.' while on the other many of the
young men of the town are great
hunters and some derive no little profit
from the outside sportsmen.

James S. Naismith says that this July
has been equal to any July he has ever
seen. While many people have i>een
out of town, enough new ones have
been in the market to keep him busy.
Mr: Naismith can see no reason why
there should be any falling off in busi
ness during the rest of the year. He
has made a number of loans during the
last month, as well as a number of good
sales, one of which was of four fine
flats, on the north side of Twenty-fifth
street, west of Grove, to Julius Weber
of Auburn. Other sales were: Lot on
Miles avenue, to Mrs. S. Higgins: three
lots in South Berkeley, to B. Judge;
house and lot on Twenty-second street,
to A. Park: corner lot at West and
Eighteenth streets, to I. Wollin.
Mr. Naismith is now finishing "for
himself on the north side of Twenty
second street, east of Webster," four of
the finest five-room fiats yet built In
Oakland. The rooms are extra large for
flats and the entire arrangement is
more on the style of a cottage In com
fort. Each flat has its own separate
entrance, separate yard, basement and
flower beds. Their situation between
Webster street and the Harrison-street
boulevard, that the city has been work
ing on for several months, and over
looking . the lake, shows . conclusively
that our real estate men -know where
to locate for a good Investment.
One only needs to peruse the records of the
real estate business done during the last six
months to see that the number of transaction))
has beer, greater than In the entire twelve
months of many former years. Business haÂ»
bÂ«en better during this vacation than ever be
fore at the same time of the year.

There has also been a considerable
increase in renting. Frank J. Wood
ward of the Uealty, Bonds and Finance
Company says that nearly half of the
offices in the new Union Savings Bank
building have already been reserved,
and nearly all 'the offices in the Bacon
building are now occupied. The same
condition prevails in regard to cottages
and flats erected this year, nearly all
of these having been rented as soon as
completed.
' A. J. Snyder reports an unusually
good 'market for this season of the
year, arid is confident that the present
prosperous condition will continue. He
says:
Noth;nÂ«r can stop the rapid growth of our
city, either in population or in property values,
if ruch property is situated i* a desirable lo
cation, as there, is nothing wanting for the
making cf a jrreat city â climate for our chil
drtn. rapid .transit for the bread earner, and a.
modern, up-to-date business ceriter tor the t-hop
pere. The ferries are doing an enormous busi
ness, and unless one stands at either of the
way stations of the railway system and
watches ftie army cf people going home In the
evening it is difficult to realize the tremendoui
traffic that exists between San Francisco and
Oakland.
The sunnnrr has so far been marked
by an unusual activity in ibt? local real
estate market. Dealers in OaWand,
Berkeley and Alameda are well satis
fied with, the amount of business trans
acted during the vacation season. The
fact that many sales of improved and
unimproved residence property have
been made during July, when many
business men are out oi the city, sub
stantiates the statements ef the rial es
tate dealers that a large percentage of
Alameda County property sold during
the summer has been purchased by
non-residents.

â¢ The first duty of a Government Is the j

synonymous with citizenship. J
As a matter of fact, a large propor- i

Some members there are who look
for a reorganization of the building
committee at to-day's meeting. Even
â¢should such a shake-up take place, it
i? doubtful whether any vital change
!n the plans would be made.
Meanwhile Architect Pissis is wait
ing: the club's pleasure. But, being a
good, patient chap, . he la waiting
calmly.
To-day the px<?ruiive board of the
California Club will meet â such- of the
members as hav returned from their
."peregrinations. - That something of in
terest will happen is expected, -since
the building committee, whose per
sonnel is largely identical with the gov
erning .board, has been most persist
pnffy "put upon" â as Mrs. Caudle used
to say.-by the club "knockers."
â¢ The weapon with which the latter are
belaying their fellow-clubraembers is
the charge of secrecy and haste in de
ciding upon the sum to be expended in
the clubhouse â likewise in the award
ing of the plans to Architect Pissis.
Now, as a matter of fact, the whole
affair was passed upon by the execu
tive board and on the same day was
submitted to the club as a whole. And,
mark you, ladies, there was not a dis
senting voice in the club. But about
a week later the import of the legis
lation dawned upon the minds of a few
passive voters, and. lo: the tempest â
the old story, "Act first, think after
ward." s
Then let us have every aid toward
that ultimate itrotecfion. Let us add to
the good work already begun by equip
ping the parental* school with a'dor
mttory. Then let us sit back and await
our interest on the investment. It will
come, just as sure as effect 'follows
cause. â¢ , â¢ ;
It la for these classes of children that
a Fcho</1 should be maintained of the
type- given above, but augmented by
the home feature. Then would the psy
cholopiral development be permitted to
prog:esf, and the results in character
and citizenship could not but develop
in Ihe right direction. And subsidiary
to the direct benefit to" the embryo citi
zen, the, activity of the government in
protect ing and educating children
would arouse in the minds of many
human animals the obligations they
owe to their offspring. And It may also
impress UDon the average human ani
mal that he has not the right to put
forth as fhanv children into the world
as he "may choose, but only as many
as he can properly care for, educate and
loaf] up to good manhood and woman
hood. The hit and miss system of rear
ing children is obsolete, and it is that
illogical system that fills our jails and
almshouses and absorbs millions of dol
lars Of taxes in! police protection that
the rest of the world may live. And
thus are we punished for our civic in
difference, for every child born unto
your household or unto mine is likewise
a child of the- inanimate thing â the gov
prnment: and, therefore, should you or
I neglect, the duties of parenthood it is
thp duty of next . of kin â the govern
mentâto stej) in and take up the bur
den. It does this solely for its own pro
tpction.
But this part done, there yet re
mains ihe final, and really the most
vital feature undevelopedâ the dormi
tory parental school.
Of what permanent use, pray. Is 'the
training of four, or five hours in the day
parental school as against five or six
hours on the streets, or in homes of
drunkenness, of lawlessness or even of
desertion, where the o'erburdened
mother is abroad earning the bread for
her babes and the locked doors of the
home d?ny admission to them?
Here dilatory and wayward ladsâ
and lassies, tooâ are brought together,
quite regardless of grade, in one room,
where a tactful and skillful teacher
grades them to suit her cenvenience
and their progress. Their pride is not
hurt by an obvious low grading, their
Individualism is developed, and real
progress in knowledge and in character
â¢is observable even in a few weeks.
And on these lines will the new
â¢school formulate its plans; and as Mr.
Faulkner is in sympathetic touch with
all the imhins in his populous south
side district, no Better appointment
could have been made â nor more pleas
ing to the clubwomen who have de
voted so much time and energy to the
work.

In furnishing a house the processes
of imitation and of assimilation both
come into play. There sefems to be no
such thing as absolute originality, but
by absorbing one Idea here and another
there one finally produces a composite
which is in a way one's own.
Uut in this assimilative process com
mon sense must .hold sway. Things
which will look well In the great roomy
country house of^ a friend may be ab
surd when transferred to a city apart
ment. The cast of the "Singing Boys"
hung in a niche especially built for It
may be a dominant note of beauty in
a room, but In a small house, hung on
a figured wallpaper, it may become the
one discordant thing In an otherwise
pleasant little living-room. This indis
criminate use of plaster casts is dis
tressing, for a note of pure white in a
room where the color is of a low rich
tone is seldom pleasant. The white
hits the eyes, as it were, bo unless the
cast is bo beautiful that you dare let

It takes a little courage to dismiss
from a room an article absolutely good

Delicate Taste in the Home.
In a .ereat many cities where Hie
quality of the milk supply is given
some attention the bacterial test has
been adopted among the others for the
determination of the quality of the
milk. This has Just been done in Bos
ton. In thai city a standard which
would amount to about 1,200,000 bac
teria, to the quantity of milk which an
ordinary, household . ' tumbler Would,
hold has been adopted. * -
It may be -interesting to learn how
the bacteriologists ever counted all
these germsj or. how they -manage to
count the germs in samples from 25
to 30 different places every day. Dr.
Slack, says the Boston Transcript, who
attends to It all personally, goes out
every morning to collect sample's. He,
visits .the .dairy station^ along the rail-'
roads, and eventually will visit stores
and restaurants also, and collects
about SO samples. He draws thQ milk
from, the can by means of a small ster
ilized and marked glass tube. The large
tube* Is 'then placed- in the box, and the.
small 'tvbe is put out of commission
for the -present, or- until It has :been
sterilized again. Another tube is -filled
in the_ same way from another can,
perhaps *at ahpther station, and when
30 samples have' been taken Ihe. bacter
iologist returns to the laboratory on
Sudbu'ry street to begin his research
work. The. temperature of the milk
in the big glass tubes is kept Just above
freezing, by Ice in both ends of the"
copper "box, so that the germs in thÂ«Â»
milk have 'no opportunity to multiply
Irom the time the sample is taken until
its purity has been tested.
At the -laboratory the bacteriologist
draws. about 15 drops from" the fupply
in the big tube â the exact amount br;
lng one c, câ and deposit- It in a Jar
containing 100 c. - c- of sterilized water.-
He shakes the jar well and then draws
one c. c. from -the" diluted contents and
drops it into' another bottle containing
100 c. c. of pure sterilized water. Only
one d. c. ' (about 15 drops) from the
contents' of this second bottle is 'ex
amined and' "it* is- .only a matter of
arithmetic- to. determine th'at the milk
subjected to. the actual baGterial j test
has been diluted 10,000 times, so' that
â¢the number of germs found in the 15'
dreps from the second, bottle must be
multiplied by 10,000 in' order to And
how much bacteria there is. In 15 drops
'of .undiluted milk. 'Sometimes there
are so many -in the diluted, drops that
it is impracticable to count them all.
But the germs in milk are so infin
itesimal that it is impossible to ispiate '
them and find even the Comparatively
few that exist in 15 drops-df so highly,
diluted milk. The 15 drops, therefore.'
are emptied Int6 -a shallow glass dish '
that, can be closed air-tight, and spread
out over a coat of agar-agar jelly, '. cm'
which the germs will feed 'and multi- Â¦
ply. In 24 hours each germ multiplies,
so enormously that it becomes sur
rounded by a cluster as large In cir
cumference as a pea, and under a read
ing glass magnifying about three times
each cluster may be distinguished with
out the slightest difficulty. Each clus
ter represents one original germ, and
the total number" of clusters found in
the glass dish is multiplied by 10,000
to find how many germs there were
in one c. c. of undiluted milk, and 'the
second total may be multiplied by 240
to find how many germs there are in
a tumbler full of such milk, since a
tumbler holds about 240 c. c.

. On the northern.coast, within a short
distance" of the township, is the extinct
.volcano Mount Tauhara, rising clear
into the air- for a height of 3600 feet and
now covered on all sides by a heavy
â¢wooded . growth. Clearly definable
through all formations is the terrace,
Â¦which encircles the entire lake a hun
dred feet above Its present level, show-
Ing .that in former times the Taupo
Â¦waters .were that measure higher than
at the present day. The western shores
of the lake are famous for the tremen
dous rhyolitic steeps of Karangahape,
Â¦which rise in a perpendicular precipice
1000 feet high above sixty fathoms of
Â¦water. There still exist many evidences
to show that these cliff3 were once used
as a last refuge resort by natives flee
ing from desperate invaders.
Caves abound In these cliffs, all of
Trhich were at one time or another used
as living places by the Taupo natives,
â¢who were cave-dwellers to a very great
extent. When giving evidence at the
native land court of Taupo just twenty
years ago the old warrior, Hitiri, said:
*'I was born in a cave at Kawakawa.
â¢ â¢ â¢ At Waihaha there is a cave
called Oruawaikaha belonging to two
tribes. The chief and his father are
buried there, Karaugahape Point
there is a cave which was used as a
pa (fortress) and called Omumutu."
There are many other interesting
records of the same character, showing
that these caves served as the birth
and death places and the fighting
haunts of the Maoris, who distin
Â¦ guished them by names as they do
houses and even trees in their customs
of to-day.
An abiding charm of Taupo Lake is
the great diversity of its shores, and
close to the Karaugahape cliffs is . a
native settlement, -numbering among
its residents the old chief Hitiri te
Paerata, Just quoted. Hitiri is a war
rior of long descent, the' hero of many
great fights. In 1864 he took part in a
brave but hopeless defense of Orakan
pa, which fell to an overwhelming Brit
ish force under General Cameron. Hi
tiri's father and other relatives were
killed, but he and his sister, Ahumai,
who was badly wounded, escaped.
These eole survivors still â¢ entertain
travelers with tales. of how they held
the fort against tremendous odds and
at last broke through the line, of mili
tary in their daring rush for life. Ahu
mai. who Is now a dqubled-up, old de
crepit, "tells how she shot two soldiers
herself on that occasion, for the Maori
women frequently bore arms with the
men.
Waterfalls, valleys, rapids, boiling
springs and icy fountains all lend their
variety to this particular shore, which
is further enhanced : by fine stretches
of primeval bush, which In many places
Elopes its soft, green way right down to
the "water's edge. In summer time the
stately branches of the Christmas tree

THE exhibit of general business last week r was
hardly as favorable as for several weeks past,
owing,, to the extension of the Western packing
house strike. Ten days ago it was supposed: that the
acuteness of the situation was over, but after working a
day the men walked out again, and from that time there
has been a slow but steady expansion of the difficulty,
which now extends from New York to the Missouri
River and involves many thousands of employes, besides
disturbing all markets connected with the meat in
dustry, including the very important lines of hides and
leather. Hides have already advanced in consequence
of the strike, and the tanners say that if it continues
much longer they will become actually scarce, in which
case there will be a marked rise in the quotations. Live :
stock, which finds its chief markets at the six or eight
packing centers, is being held back on the farms and
ranges, and those districts where stockraising is the
leading industry will very soon feel the effects of the
suspension of the movement.
Right on the heels of this Western packers' strike
comes another at Fall River, where 25,600 mill hands
have struck against a reduction in wages, the immediate
effect of this being the almost complete suspension of
the production of # print cloths. Furthermore, another
coal" strike, involving 80,000 men, is threatened, while
the packers' strike is leading to sympathetic disturb
ances, among which is' a possible strike of railroad em
ployes. ;" - . â¢ ,
"Of course, all this disturbance affects trade, It offsets,
more or less, the buoyant feeling created by the excel
lent crop prospects and restricts the operations of the
large merchants and manufacturers, who do not care to
run the risk of stocking "up' with large lines of goods
which they may not be able to work off for an indefinite
period. It may explain the -less favorable 'showing of
the bank clearings, which showed' a loss for .the -week,
of. 10.3 per cent as compared with the same week last
year and a decline in the aggregate clearings from over
$2,000,000,000 to .$1,844,000,000, with all the leading cities
except Boston, Cincinnati and Minneapolis ranged on
the adverse side" of the list. The failures for the week
were 220, against 190 l,ast year.. .' .
.It is' unfortunate that these large strikes have occurred
just at .the moment when a business revival seemed well
under way. They have decreased the demand for a.num
ber of- commodities in the trade areas subject to their in-,
fluence, have restricted credits and retarded the opening
of the fall trade, which promised to be larger than ex
pected several months ago. . They haye impaired invest
ments in railroad- shares by threatening to cut down the
earnings .of '.the railroads, 'though the latter are making
a. very fair, showing; those for July being only about 2.7
per cent less than last 'year. They have given capital
another 'shiver- just at the moment when the timidity
and hesitancy which kept it in' a condition of stagnation
fpr months were disappearing.
The staples all along the line reflect the adverse con
ditions'caused by the .labor disturbances. Provisions are
dragging all over the country. ; Numerous textile mills
in the East are shutting down, or- running on reduced
time in consequence. Wholesale pric.es for cattle, sheep
and hogs are going down and -the stock raisers are
obliged to pay but a good deal .of money to feed this
held-back stock, which otherwise, would have been sent
to- market and got /out of the way. 'In brief, dozens of
lines. are affected by these new labor disturbances. .
The crop prospects, which, as already meritioned / form
the basis of business calculations this year, continue very
encouraging. Experts are now figuring on 2,500,000,000
bushels of corn, Â¦625,ooo,ooo:bushels of wheat and' 11,500,
000 bales-of cotton,'and as all three products are bring
irig' very fair prices' it is reasonably expected. that the
country will have a. very good season, provided the labor
troubles do not .increase to such proportions as to para
lyze trade in. their respective districts., In anticipation
of moving thesclarge^crops some Western .'railroads are
said to be placing ; liberal orders 'for supplies and ma
terial,, in spite of the recent damage 'to the wheat crop,
and th'e president of one of the leading systems operat
ing wstward from Chicago is quoted as .saying that the
year "1905 will make np for all the inactivity in construc
tion work and betterments during 1904.
The war has suddenly loomed up into increased im
portance as a trade factor during the past week. It had
practically ceased to figure as an' issue, when the un
expected activity of the Russians in seizing ships in the
Red Sea and Oriental Pacific created apprehensions of
new international complications and sent a ripple of ex
citement all over the world. The stock markets of Lon
don and New York,* not to mention the European
bourses, at once became unsettled, sensitive and fever
ish, exchange â¢ fluctuated and the bonds of different
nations showed the effect, of possible complications by
weakening more or less. On this coast the effect of the
seizures was pronounced, for vast amounts of goods
are now being sent from San Francisco to the Orient,
and our export trade is bound to be affected if the,
seizures continue. In fact, the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company on - Saturday announced that it would receive
no more freight for Japan.
The feature of the week locally was the throwing
open by the Government of the Panama Railroad to all
shippers of freight. As already shown by The Call, this
will be a great stimulus to the commerce of the port of
San Francisco by enabling it to regain from New 'York,
Chicago, St. Louis and other large Eastern distributing
points a vast trade area wrested from it years ago by
the acquisition of the controls of "the isthmian railroad
by the' transcontinental rail and "steamer lines. Years
ago we were the .distributing -point for about all the
territory on the Pacific Slope extending as* far east as
Colorado; but when by reason of the passing of the
Panama line into the control of the overland railroads
the Chicago -and St. Louis merchants* could undersell
San .Francisco,- even in Oakland, not to mention Sacra
mento and other important cities, we lost a fine plum.
It looks now as if we were to get that plum back again,
and if we do it behooves us to keep; our commercial
fist closed over it in the future. It is too fine a prize to
be carelessly guarded. It is easily lost and with difficulty
regained. â¢ :^ Â¦
For the rest, conditions in California remain about as
before stated. The growing conviction that our wheat
and barley crops will be -lighter than expected several
months ago; has caused : heavy .buying of both' these
"grains in the three large interior valleys, where buyers
have been eagerly paying the farmers more than San-
Francisco prices to obtain supplies. Speculators have
supplemented these purchases, hence pronounced ' ac
. tivity is reported in : the grain market. J\.ll the other
important' crops are turning ;out well and are bringing
first-rate prices as a rule, so the agricultural and com
mercial conditions in California may" be pronounced ex-

ONCE' more we have reached the season of the
year when reports d forest fires will form a
frequent and sometimes a notable feature of
the news of the day. Already such reports have begun
and ere long we shall be having them from every part
of the United States and in. a marked degree from the
States of the Pacific Coast. Â¦
Our yearly tribute to negligence and carelessness in
this respect is enormous, and in this year, as in those
that have preceded, .many millions of dollars' worth hi
precious woodlands will be burned away solely because
we are too indifferent to their value to undertake their
preservation.
.In California the campaign of education on this sub
ject^has been carried so far that well nigh every one
whose opinion is worth anything is already convinced
of the importance of devising some practical means of
protecting the forests of the State. Furthft- argument
upon that phase of the question is* unnecessary, and if
insisted upon would be tiresome. The next step to be
taken, is the formulation of a fairly comprehensive and
scientific planof forest protection and its presentation to
the Legislature for adoption. -Associations that have
been 'formed for the purpose of conserving the woods
and forests should at once set themselves to the task
of achieving that step. . Â¦â¢ . â¢
We are to elect anew Legislature this fall and we are
to have a legislative session next winter. This, there
fore, is a. good time to press the^ question upon public
attention as one of ; practical politics. The forest fires
that are sure to be blazing from the Oregon line to Ari
zona during the dry season will help on the work of
rousing the minds of voters to a sense of the imperative
need of. making at least a beginning in the way of scien
tific forestry. If then the right use be made of the
lessons they teach we may get some profit out of dis
asters that in the past'have caused ribthiqg but loss. At
any rate the topic is; a timely one and remedial action
cannot be too persistently urged. .
What color is least easily seen at a
distance? One would naturally say
some dull neutral tint, a somber gray
or brown. This has been the conclusion
of most military men, and our brilliant
dress uniforms have given way for
practical campaigning to khaki and
other dull colors. Is thi3 a mistake?
Possibly so, according to the results
obtained in recent experiments in Eng
land. It has been found there that
masses of dull color are very much
mere conspicuous at a distance than
mixtures of bright tints. For instance,
a battery of field artillery, whose car
riages and caissons were decorated with
stripes of red, blue ana yellow, could bo
made out with difficulty at 1000 yards,
while other batteries painted a uniform
brown or drab were easily seen at great
distances. It would seem as If, on, the
same principle, a regiment of gayly
dressed troops might be less easily vis
ible than one wholly garbed in dull
colored khaki. â Success.

STONEâ B. C, City. Why England
and other countries adopted, "stone"
as a unit of weight is not explained in
any published book, and some anti
quarians who have searched for the
origin of the j same say "it Is lost In
obscurity." It is recognized in differ
ent places, but a stone differs in weight
with the articles to be weighed. Re
search shows that the stone was a
haphazard unit. In Babylon a stone
wa3 recognized as the 360th part of a
talent, and the weight of a talent is
113 lbs, 10 oz, 1 dwt and 10 gr.' In Eng
land a stone is the 8th part of tho
100 weight, or 14 pounds. In delving
for information about ancient weights
Sir A. H. Layard says that he discov
ered that weights fell Into two classes:
(A) those in the shape of a lion made
of bronze and (B) those in the shape
of a duck, made of stone. From thta
some have deducted that In ancient
times a bronze lion as a unit of weight
was abbreviated to "a lion" and a duck
of stone to "a stone," and that that
was the origin of stone as a unit. In
Texas in the long ago stones, were used
as a means, of weighing. For Instance,
If a farmer wanted to know how much
a hog weighed he would tie the pork
er's feet together and hang him by the
feet to the end of a rail, throw the rail
over a fence, then he would put a bag
at the other end and nil it with stones
until there was an even balance. After
that he would guess how. much
%tone weighed.

WHILE neither of the ratification meetings held
in this city can be justly called notable in any
respect, ' they .none the* less served to show
something of the sentiment of the people, on th'e issues of
the time. They may be accepted, therefore; as more or less
significant of the trend the campaign'will be forced to
take as soon as it passes from control of the politicians
into that of the masses to whom the spellbinders will be
compelled to appeal when they take the ' stump. For
that reason they are worth studying as straws whose
drifting shows the. way the wind blows.
The sentiment of the Republican meeting was clear
and unmistakable. It is expressed completely in the
.phrase, "stand pat." Every word of indorsement given
to the record of the party, to its principles, , to its plat
form, to the administration, to . the candidates, was
heartily applauded. The rank and file of the party are
evidently satisfied with the condition of the country and
gratified over the relations of the administration to our"
existing prosperity. They desire no change except that
which will come in the steady advancement of the coun
try along the lines already established by Republican
statesmen. The maintenance of the administration will
therefore be the chief feature of the Republican cam
paign, and it is s>fe to say that in Republican meetings
there will be hardly any other issue discussed. ââ¢
The temper displayed by the audience at the Demo
cratic ratification was by ho means so clearly shown,
nor can it be so tersely stated. The speakers of the
evening were many and their arguments were various,
Taken altogether they may be said to -have spread a
dragnet over the whole sea of politics, but. failed to
bring to the surface anything of importance. The state
ment of one of the speakers that the trusts sell articles
of American manufacture cheaper in .foreign countries
than at home brought forth applause, and it would seem
that some kind of a tariff fight might rouse the ardor of
a Â¦ portion "at least of the Democratic masses. On the
other hand "an attempt by one of the leading orators of
the evening to impress the audience with a conviction
that we are upon the eve of hard times," that the cost
of living has increased, that the Republicans^have given
the country. what is virtually. a seventy-cent dollar, failed
utterly. Thus it appears that if a tariff fight be made at
all it will have to be made upon very narrow lines, for
the people cannot be persuaded that "they 'are. not pros
perous and well paid under the protective system.. ;â¢>
Another significant feature of the" Democratic meeting
was the coldness with which the name, of Parker was
received.. Even the speakers of the evening did hot show
enthusiasm for him. Several of them, indeed,- had not
even taken the trouble to learn his name, and while one.
of them spoke of him as Alton G. Parker, others calfed
him Allen G. or Allen B. It is evident that to. the
Democracy of this city Parker is a nullity. We may
look, therefore, for a campaign on the Democratic side
made up largely of appeals to the memory of Jefferson
and Jackson, with a little talk about tariff and trusts and
a good deal of windy denunciation of the grqnd old
party and its candidates. â¢. ." ' â¢Â¦-:';. .-."

Leaving the gold ores, one Is at
tracted to what is the rarest and one
of the 'most beautiful exhibits in the
Mines building, at the same time one
of the most unique, viz., the lepidolite,
or lithia mica exhibit," the apex of
vhich can be seen from most parts of
the building. When this Is seen from
a distance the visitor at once deter
mines on a closer inspection. A large
exhibit of this nature excites wonder
To the casual visitor the crystals of
rubellite, showing In the lithia mica
and the variety of coloring in the for
mation, appeals to the artistic fancy.
Many demands for a specimen of the
lepidolite have been made by visitors
The copper, ore's are representative
samples. Their.ost prominent 1 mines
as well as many prospects are here rep

A nutabcr of ta* packers /went huma on
l"uesday night and >*jiterday ihe confcrencÂ«
U'as carried pn by Wiom Â¦who were left, but this
Impression -was -rained that three who had
Sti'ne away wÂ»re" wiilliig to abide by what thoÂ»c
,>.-ho remained decided upoa. The while of- th9

rectir* were ready to continue the nr#dtiat!ons'
they- "would b"- notified and 'throuchout thÂ«
mornlns they halted, with What patience they
could muster, for the tiotlticatlori to come.' At
2 o'clox-k In the afternoon the packers were
called In and the coherence continued ' until
evening. When it terminated It was easily to
be seen that the packers were not aatisflcd
and orders were promptly given by those .w'hq
came from San Francisco for the transfer df
their baggage to the depot, the best indication
that negotiations- were oft and there was '-110th.
Ing doing." 1 ! â¢â¢
It was learned later that the failure to
agree was due to* the stubborn adherence "of
the packers to the .flat rental basis and tha un
willingness â¢ of .the directors tÂ«v concodo any
thing more, than a payment- -to the packers
of. a sum -contingent upon the amount of goods
sold. . - - *
It will be seen that the difference between
thfe proposition of the dlrectora and that- of tho
packer* Is a difference between the Certainty
of a pack and the uncertainty of a Bale, The
packers can ficure with reasonable- "accuracy
upon -hew mucl^of tho crop they will pack,
aod on that basis each one can . figure after
the basis ot distribution is arranged what the
revenue . will ,5 be. But the directors, . in .the
Interest of the growers, insist that the payment
to the packer shall be only Â« payment, for
for selling services rendere/1. "Otherwise, tfle*
say, the packer has no Inducement to move
tbe crop and. a payment for packing !s, only
an Incentive, i not to industrious selling but^a
an increase of the pack. â¢ Â°* > .,
At. these divergent points the directors and
the packers parted. It may be that negotTations
will be renewed.- but there ie no certainty that
they will be. In the -meantime, of aourse the
packers ara at liberty .- to - buy in thV qpea
market and it la rtllt In ; the . hands of /trio
growers tc decide whether they will, by sign-
Ing ' contract* with the association, enabU the
directors to insist upon the terms whlth are
to the advantage of the grower, or whether
they wtÂ« sell their crops direct to the packerj
and take chances of what the results may be
The HaJ of the names of those who ha've
Â¦Igned contracts with the association ' will be
printed at : the end of the ; month. There has
been but a small addition to the acreage coil
traded to, the .association, and It begins to look

them. Onc ; by one t*ie sails ripped out of the
boltrope9 and went fluttering away to leeward.
The ship was thrown on her beam ends by the*
lorce of the gale, and when she finally rljrhted

The tennis cracks figured in some in-i
teresting tournament and practice
matches yesterday. On. the park
courts, the third and fourth classes
were completed. Melville Long won
the third class honors with compara
tive ease, while H. Getz proved his su
periority in the fourth class. In the
first class, the unfinished match be
tween R. X. Whitney and George BakÂ«
er went to . the latter by default. The
match stood two sets to one in Baker's,
favor last Sunday. This gave Baker
his third victory and a new cu*p wiM
have to* be put jup for the first class.
In the second class, the defeat of G.
M. Guerin at the 'hands cf D. M. Lent-'
on was a surprise. Guerin and Long
have always been considered the best
in their class and they were expected
to meet in the finals.- The defeat of
Guerin made it easy for Long.* In the
finals he beat Lemon three sets out
of four. Long had previously won two
sets from T. A. Allen in the semi-finals.
In the fourth class, the competition
was extremely close.. The best match
was that between Getz and Wollen-*
berg. They met in the semi-finals and
three stubbornly contested sets result
ed. Wollenberg won the first set and
almost took the second. After losing
this by a 10-8 score he seemed to lose
heart and his opponent took the final
set handily. In the finals, 'Getz proved
much too strong for C. E. Allen. The
latter was beaten in. straight sets. In
the semi-finals Alien won two close
sets from W. L* .Howell. . .
On the California Club courts . the
lower class men; had an inning. The
first class men were absent and the en
thusiasts of the second, third . and
fourth classes held sway. Harry
Haight and Harry Rolfe furnished the
best match in singles. Haight was
right on edge - and Rolfe could not
get a set from him. Haight won three
straight, the last two of which: were
close. Haight then joined forces with
C. Kurlin, taking on Ray Cornell and
Chester Smith. The latter were toÂ«
strong for them and won both sets
played. .:
Charles Kurlin was in good form In
his match with Smith. He lost both
sets, but they were close and
Kurlin was at no time outclassed.*
George Janes took on two of the
lower class men and won easily. L. C.
Bozarth and â¢ "W. Murphy played three

1 The finish was a memorable one, a
j wind-up that probably will not happen
| again for years to come. For eight
! rounds the home teanV battled and
j strived' to coax a run home, but every
effort was repulsed. Every one lost
hope and there seemed little chance of
evea a tie score. But that one little er
ror broke it all up and put San Fran
cisco on the boards and in the percent
age column.
Both ileany and Irwin died on pop
fijea in the last half of the ninth, and
the crowd began to file slowly out when ,
Charley Irwin lined a grounder to big j
Russ Hail. The ball took a bad bound
and Hail booted it. A wild cheer arise
as Anderson tapped gently to right field
for two bases, and when Tommy Leahy
smote the leather out over second base
and won the game it was great to hear
the multitude yelL .
The Seattle players were dumfound
ed, so suddenly did the sensation ma
terialize. Xo one seemed to realize
what had happened. Shields threw up
his hands in despair at the thought of
pitching shut-out ball for eight innings
and three Quarters, only â¢ to lose his
game on an error.
When Seattle.made a run in the sixth
inning it setmed the end of the strug
gle'. It was then that Mohler beat out
a well-rlaced bunt and traveled to sec
ond on Barber's wide throw. Deleharity
responded with a drive over second
base, and the run was a reality. Frisk
sacrificed Del along, and Murphy was
given a life on Anderson's boot. He
and Delehanty tried the "double steal,
but it went wrong.
After tttat time both pitchers got into
the game and passed up assortments
that could not be fathomed by the
batsmen. The exhibition was a" grand
one, only to be marred CneJly by Hall's
unfortunate error just when the" game
belonged to Seattle. The score:

at Recreation Park. Two had been de

The most effective ' work was done,
however, by ttfe Gorter water tower
and batteries. These splendid fire
fighting machines were stationed In
front of the Hilbert Company's building
and tons of water were thrown into the
flames. The effect of the streams from
the water j tower and batteries was to
drown the flames, and a flood s of water
poured down from floor to floor, filling
the cellar, with four feet of water. The
adjoining, cellars of " the Deere . Imple
ment Company had a similar amount

on the, one side, and .the Deere Imple
ment Company,- William Cluff Compa

and Dunham, Carrigan & Hayden at
Market and Main streets.
The flre walls aided the heroic work
of the firemen, who realized that the
entire block was menaced should the
flre spread from the building where it
was raging.
Lines of hose were affixed to the
stand pipes on the buildings and other
hose was carried up the. iron flre es
capes and water â¢ played in many
streams onto the roof of the doomed
structure.
The clanging of the fire bells and the
galloping horses with engines and

Assistant Chief Dougherty directed
the efforts of the firemen to preventing
the fire from spreading to buildings ad
joining the one where the Hilbert Com
pany was located.. It was quickly seen
that nothing could, be done to save the
establishment of the liquor house. The
four-story building was on . fire from
top to bottom, sheets of flame sweep
irtg from the windows and . soaring
through the roof to a height of fifty
feet. ' â¢-;.-
â¢ The fire was first discovered at 4:43 p.
m. by Policeman A. L. Martien, who
was. on duty at Market arid Main
streets. He saw smoke issuing from
the ground floor windows , of the Hil
ben Company's place of business, and
he ran toward the store, ' which 4s lo
cated in the middle of the Arizona
block.
As he reached the front of the build
ing a sheet of flame swept upward
from the ground floor through the ele
vator Bhaf t. In an instant the {our
story building was completely envel
oped. â¢ ,
The policeman sent in an alarm from
box 267, at Market and Beale streets,
and a Morse patrolman, who also ob
served the fire, pulled a box at Drumm
and California streets. >
The Fire Department responded
quickly. . On the arrival of Assistant

alarm.

completely-gutted. " .â¢ .; ;;*:,;;..< . :
The building, .located in "the Arizona
block, was damaged to the extent of
$25,000. Water and smoke- ruined prop
erty belonging to wholesale business
houses to a total of $50,000.
The spectacular blaze in the liquor
store was witnessed by a concourse of
pepple estimated* at 20,000. - .
, This theory Is borne out by the state
ment of Dan Galli, a young man em
ployed by the Hilbert Mercantile Com
pany. Galli was passing the store of
his employers three minutes before the
flre was discovered and saw no sign of
flames at that time.
During the progress of the fire Police
man McGowan notified' acting Chief
Dougherty .that : smoke was issuing j
from a pile of. lumber in the yard of
Blyth & Trott, Spear and Mission |
streets. The acting chief detailed en- j
ginea 7, 27 and 31 to. look after the lum- !
ber yard blaze, and after, a stubborn !
fight, as the flre was deep down in th'e j
pile, it was got under control. Almost
the entire pile had to be torn down be- 1
fore the firemen considered their labor
finished. It was thought that a ; spark
from the big fire lodged In the pile. The
loss will not be heavy,
About the same time smoke was seen
coming from the roof of.E. A. Aigel
tinger's hay and grain warehouse, 25
and 27. Spear, street. The hose was
turned on the" roof . and , the incipient
blaze was speedily extinguished. It was
evidently caused by a spark.
Daniel J. McLaughlin. a v reporter for
The Call, was injured during the fire
by being kicked by one of the horses
of the Fire tjepartment. McLaughlin
was removed to his home, where hl3
injuries were treated by Dr. Miller."
Excellent police arrangements in
handling the big, crowds of people at
the fire aided the work of the fire-fight
ers.
Secretary Hilbert. stated last evening
that it was the custom to keen an elec
tric light burning-in front of the safe
when the store was closed. His theory
is that a spark from the electric motor
set fire to some excelsior and that the
flames swept upward .through the ele
vator shaft, communicating to the in
flammable stock of liquors on the floors
above.
It is thouuht the fire was due to a
spark, from an electric motor situated
in the" cellar of the Hflbert Mercantile
Company's place of business.
THE CAUSE OF THE FIRE.
The Illinois Pacific Glass Companyy
10 to 16 Main street, sustained a loss of
about" $10,000 by smoke and water. The
rear of their building abuts on that of
the Hilbert Mercantile Company, and a
vast amount of water came through
the roof of the former's place of busi
ness. On the top floor o.f .the Pacific.
Glass Company's building a'number of
machines " used -in printing .wine .and.
grocery labels were damaged by water,
and thousands of . champagne -corks
were damaged by smoke.. â¢ .
A. Heunish, a member, of the firm,
said last evening that it would' be im
possible to estimate the amount of their
damage until to-day, but" he. thought
that $10,000 wonld cover it. The- firm
carries ample-insurance. .*
After the fire was' under control the
work of pumping out the water from
the cellars -of the Arizona block was
commenced. It proceeded until a late
hour. . .â¢
of groceries in Us building' valued at
$250,000; The damage by smoke and
.water to their property will amount to
about $2000.-
Mr. Holbrook stated that his firm's;
loss oa stock of cans on the top * floor !
of the Hilbert building, would be be*
tween $7500 and $10,000, fully â¢ covered
by insurance. He estimated that; the
pipes in the cellar.of the building were
valued at $10,000 and that the' loss on
them would be about fifty per cent.
The cellar stock was covered by . in
surance.
The Deere Implement: Companv., at
221 Market street, had a stock of goods
in ' the ; water-filled Â¦ cellars of its build
ings valued at $40,000. B. B. Willey, a
member of the firm, estimated their
loss at fifty per cent, all' covered by
insurance. â¢ â¢ .
i The "William Cluff Company, situated
at 201 to 207 Market street," had a" stock
IXDSSES BY AVATER.
The Arizona block, which is occupied
by the William Cluff Company, the
Deere Implement Company and the Hil
bert Mercantile Company, is owned by
R. R. Thompson of 1501 Van Ness ave
nue. The quarters of the various firms
are separated by heavy fire walls. That
portion of the Arizona block in which
the fire occurred is valued by the owner
at $50,000, the Insurance on it being
$12,600. : -.Â¦'Â¦Â¦Â¦
F. H. Hilbert, secretary of the* Hil
bert Mercantile Company, said last
night that his firm carried bet'.vee'n
$90,000 and $100,000 worth of goods, all
of which were ; destroyed! The loss is
covered by insurance, but Mr. Hilbert
did not know .what company carried
the policies, this matter t>eing left to
an insurance agent.
H. M. Holbrook of the j firm of Hol
brook, Merrill & Stetson arrived at, the
scene of the fire in the automobile of
his friend, H. B. Lazelere, word having
been telephoned to him of the â¢ fire.
They picked up John- F. Merrill, . vice
president of the firm, on their way
down town and made a quick run to
the scene of the conflagration.
The fire in the Hilbert Mercantile
Company's building was under control
in about an hour after the alarms were
responded to by the Fire Department,
but the engines and men were kept
busy until after 7 p. m. . Few of the
firemen were in their regular working
clothes, as on Sunday they wear their
dress uniforms and the natty, blue suits
were soaked with water and tainted by
smoke. . . . .
The entire stock was destroyed, all
Â¦that \va3 left intact being the firm's
safe, containing its books and records.
The swirl and dash of the flames pry
vented any attempt to save property fn
the Hilbert place and the exploding of
barrels of whisky and other goods
added a picturesque touch to the scene.'
The basement and top floor < of the
Hilbert building were occupied by Hol
brook, Merrill & Stetson. The top floor
was stocked with cans and the bassment
was filled with iron pipes of all kinds.
The Hilbert Mercantile Company; a.lso
uped the basement for a small stock
of mineral waters arid beer. The Un
derwriters' Patrol , rendered- effective
work, under Captain Comstock, in
spreading rubber covers in the vestab
mfcnts adjoining the one where the fire
raged. Many thousands of dollars'
worth of poods were thus saved from
damage by smoke and water which en
tered the building.

The platform car used by the United
Railroads as. a counterbalance "on the
Fillmore-street hill lies In the. mud at
the bottom of the, bay, a. few feet from
the Fillmore-street â¢ wharf, and in all
probability this will be its last resting
place, as officers of- the company con
sider that it would, cost more to .rajse
it than it IS worth. â¢
The car is of cheap construction and
equal in weight to two of the antpty
cars ordinarily used Qn the line. ' When
the time comes for the last Oar to be
returned to the carhouse at night' the
platform ear, ballasted with concrete',
is taken to the top of the hill, attached
to the cable at . Broadway ami Its
weight going down hoists the last par
to the top of the hill. It is kept on
the switch all night and in the morn
ing counterbalances the flret car. com
ing down, the hill.. ;.^.
This has been, the practice several
years, and, contrary to the prophecies'
when the road was first built, acci
dents have been rare. Yesterday morn
ing something went wrong, however,
arid that no one was' injured is re*
markable. At one o'clock- the "bal
ance" car was brought to the top of
the hill â¢ to bring up the last regular
car. The motorman left it for a mo
ment while it was being coupled to the
cable and in some manner it started
down the hill. The grade is one pf the
steepest in the city and the heavy car,
weighted with a ton or more of ballast,
careered madly down the hill. The mo
mentum it gained in the two steep
blocks was terrific and -it gained. rather
than lost headway on the comparative
ly level stretch which follows. At the
end of the line there is -neither buffer
I nor bulkhead and the car, leaving the
rails, continued its course over- the rot
ting wharf, tearing up the planks arid
leaving great gaps in the flooring. The
marks on what- is. -left' of the wharf
would indicate that for at least 200
yards the car must have .run on two
wheels, as but a single line is visible.
Near the end of the wharf it. struck
a joist and toppled oyer into the bay.
The scene Ql the accident was vis
ited yesterday by hundreds- of curious
people, who Viewed- the wrecked wharf
and what could be seen of the car,
speculating as to what might have hap
pened had the accident occurred dur-.
ing the busy hours of the day. There
is very little trafllc on .the streets in
that . neighborhood at night, but ft.
JJnion-str-eet -'car. bound .toward the
Presidio; crossed .Filjmore a few min
utes after the runaway car went down
the hill.- Had the two met the run
away -would have crushed the Union
street car like an eggshell. * .
