BAN JOSE. July 30.â The Grand Jury
to-morrow will resume its Investigation
Into the death of Gustav Hueter. A
cumber of witnesses have been sum
moned, among 'them Albert Hueter and
the Japanese servant, who are eaid to
have discovered Mrs. Hueter In a com
promising position with her physician the
Thursday evening before Hueter's death.
A number of other witnesses have been
subpenaed. Some of these were on the
train on which Hueter returned to his
home from this city on the night of the
tragedy, and it is said that they will
testify that Hueter's actions on that oc
casion were erratic and unusual.
In the neighborhood of the Hueter
home the opinion as to whether it was a
case of murder or an act of self-defense
Is divided. The absorbing topic is who
Is the physician that was friendly with
Mrs. Hueter. It Is a known fact that
Dr. F. W. Knowles of Los Gatos was
her attending physician.
Mrs, Hueter to-day expressed a desire
that *he be allowed to do some shopping,
and Sheriff Ross allowed her to go up
town in company with her sister .and
father. The woman is not chaffing un
der' the ' restraint ot confinement. Many
friends call to see her.
Albert Hueter will tell his- story be
fore the Grand Jury to-morrow. He says
there was never any trouble between the
children and the stepmother.
Dr. F. VT. Knowles. who Is a weil
knewn physician of Los Gatos and a
former Supervisor, when seen In his or
fiee to-day In regard to. being more than
friendly with Mrs. Hueter, | refused to
talk on the subject. He became very
\u25a0wrathy and Insulting, although he ad
mitted that he had been the physician
for Mrs. Hueter. He declared he would
hold any paper liable that mentioned his
name in connection with the matter, and
ordered the reporter from' his office.
Knowles is a married man and 47 years of
age. He has a wife, but no children.
SOX MAKES DISCOVERY.
Says He Saw Dr. Knowles Leaving Hue
ter Home at 4 A. M.
Albert Hueter, son of Gustav Hueter,
who resides near Alma in Santa Clara
County, will to-day tell the Grand Jury
fit San Jose that the physician who had
been on intimate terms with Mrs. Gustav
Hueter, is Dr. F. W. Knowles of Los
Gatos, who has been the Hueter family
physician. This statement was . made by
members of the Hueter family last night.
The discovery of the relations existing
between the physician and Mrs. Gustav
Hueter was made by Albert Hueter, and
was related by him to various members
of his family.
Gustav Hueter received a telegram on
Wednesday morning, before the shooting,
cal^ng him to I San Francisco on business,
and he left early in. the morning. Albert
Hueter playÃ in the orchestra at country
dances. He was scheduled to make a
trip to Wrights for this purpose on Wed
nesday night.
The dance was of shorter duration
than usual, being over at 11:20. Al
bert thought of his father's wife
being alone, or supposedly alone,
on the farm, and he rode to the home to
see if all was right. .As he approached
the house he was startled to see a light
burning in the parlor.
Thinking that possibly a burglar had
entered the house, he tied his horse and
crept to the window. Removing his
shoes in order that he* could approach
the closed blind, he peered Into the
room and the shadow of a man was re
vealed.
Soon the light was turned out In this
room, but reappeared again in the
kitchen, so he stole down the veranda
and taw Mrs. Hueter preparing^ meal.
Then the light was turned on In the
dining-room, and Albert, peering Into
the bedroom across the hall, recognized
the features of Dr. Knowles. Albert
then hunted up tbe Japanese servant as
a witness, and both made their way
back to the post at the window and saw
Mrs. Hueter and Dr. Kndwles eating
peaches and cream at the dining-room
table. This was about 4 a. m.
Alfred and the Japanese begran a
search for the buggy In which Knowles
had driven to the ranch. While they
were searching In the grove some dls-t
tance from the house they heard_ the
door open and saw Dr. Knowles ~ and
Mrs. Hueter coming out. The couple
walked to the prune orchard, where tho
horse and buggy were tied and * both
came riding back past Albert and the
Japanese, who were under cover. A
short distance beyond the grate . Mrs.
Hueter bade the doctor, farewell and
walked back to the house. '-
Gustav Hueter did not return from San
Francisco until Thursday evening. On
Friday morning: Albert told his father
of what he had witnessed. Dr. Knowles
was the last man Hueter would! have
Buspected, for he had been the family
physician and friend.

ANTI-IRISH
MOTION IS
DEFEATED
Balfour Beaten in
the House of
Commons.
Proposed Reduction of
\ Erin's Membership
Rejected.
Opposition Clamors Loudly
for the Resignation of
the Ministry.
LONDON, July 20.â The Government
was defeated In the House of Commons
to-night by a majority of three on the
motion to reduce the membership from
Ireland.
On the announcement of the vote the
greatest excitement was produced by the
Liberals and the Irish . members yelling
"Resign." â¢
The incident is considered hardly of
sufficient importance to justify the Gov
ernment in resigning, but when asked by
Sir Henry Campbcll-Bannerman. the
leader of the opposition, which course he
intended to pursue. Premier Balfour
declined to make a statement.
John Redmond, leader of the Irish
party, said the Premier had repeatedly
declared that he would resign if de
feated, and If he disregarded this vote
of want of confidence he would be acting
against all precedents. Was he going. to
swallow this humiliation as he swallowed
every other humiliation during the last
few years? the Premier was asked by
Redmond. - ; \u25a0; . .". \u25a0/.-\u25a0'..
Balfour,*' replying very.coldly, said , that
Redmond, had -greatly -agitated himself
over a milter which could be. ; settled* in
due time, -He was, he said, r.ot conscious
of . any humiliation. There would be.am
ple opportunity,^ withlnSa'.. few .hours , of
proving whether the Government "still en
joyed the confidence of the majority of
the House. â¢ â¢:â¢,\u25a0"" ' .; : "
The Premier said he would consult
his colleagues as to whether the question
would be again submitted to a vote and
would make a statement on Monday.
After some wrangling over the question
whether to adjourn until Monday, it was
decided to adjourn until to-morrow. ,
Sir Edward Grays motion of censure
of the Government regarding thenseal
question*wlll be discussed on Monday,
and the Ministerialists argue that its
rejection will prove that the Govern
ment still possesses the confidence of
Parliament. It Is not unlikely, how
ever, that Long 1 , the Chief Secretary for
Ireland, will resign.
BELGIUM DEFENDS
THE CONGO REGIME
Official Denial of Charges
Contained in Dr. B&c
cari's Report.
BRUSSELS, July 20.â An authorita
tive statement was made to-day warn
ing Americans against forming an er
roneous impression from the press dis;
cusslon of the report -of Dr. Baccari
(the Italian expert who was sent by
King Victor Emmanuel to the Congo
Independent State to report on the pos
sibility of starting an Italian emigra
tion scheme") concerning the status of
the Congo State. -The main object of
Dr. Baccari, It is poinetd out, was to
examine the question of extensive Ital
ian emigration. to the Congo. Hi? ru
port does not advise this, his chief rea
sons being climatic conditions and dif
ferences in transport and victualling.
It is not true, the authoritative state
ment continues, that the report refers
to a geheral state of slavery existing
In. the Congo, as has been alleged. , It
Is equally untrue, it is added^ that an
attempt was made, to poison Dr. Bac
cari. Competent courts, Investigated
and found the charge to be unfounded.
No faith Js attached, tho statement
says in conclusion, to the disparaging
letters on the Congo from -. Italian
sources, owing to proof possessed here
of the methods employed by those mak
ing the allegations. On the other hand,
some of tho most renowned Italians,
namely, Goneral Moltedo, celebrated for
his bravery during the Abyssinian cam
pafgn;.- Lieutenant Colonel ' Delll and
Drfe. Attard. and Polidorio.
deny ever having seen apts of- malad
ministration In the Congo.
The Italian Minister for Foreign Af
fairs, It Is farther pointed out, 'said
that the attacks on the administration
of the. Congo were exaggerated, and re
fused, to recall the Italian officers
serving there. .

The . Nevr York Legislature, at the
aussestlon of Governor Wjsrsina, has
decided to Investigate the affairs of the
life insurance companies dolnc business
In the State. A message was received'"
by the Legislature from the Governor
yesterday In which he called attention
to the Equitable scandal and the Inade
quacy of tbe laws under which the
financiers in control had been able to
turn the society's vast capital to their
personal advantage. The Investiga
tion will be conducted by a Joint com
mittee, of both houses with the purpose
of purtins an end to exlstlns abuses by
framing: a statute which will effectual!? '
gruard the interests of the policy hold
ers...
ALBANY. N. T.. July 20.â There will be
a legislative Investigation. of the life In
surance business as carried on In this
State, both by New York State corpora
tions and by those in other States doing
business in this State. This Investigation
will be made by a special joint commit
tee with ample powers, of which tbe chair
man win be State Senator William. Arm
strong of Rochester, a Republican. Tha
other State Senators on the committee
will be W. J. Tulley of Corning, a Re
publican, and Daniel J. Riordan of New
York City, a Democrat. Senators Arm
strong and Tulley are lawyers and Rior
dan la a real estate and insurance agent.
The two Republicans are said to have
been selected by Governor Higgins anÂ»l
Senator Raines, Republican leader In the
Senate. The Assembly members of the
committee will bo named by Speaker
Nixon within the next day or two.'
. Chairman Armstrong said to-night that
while the actual hearing by the commit
tee 'would probably not begin for some
time, the preliminary preparations, -would
be set in motion as soon as possible and
1 the organization, of- the committee would *
take place as soon as the Assembly mem
bers had been appointed.
MESSAGE OF GOVERXOK.
The institution of the committee fol
lowed a message from Governor Higgins
to the Legislature, which came as a sur
prise. The message was received In the
Senate after the conclusion of the Hooker
case and was not read until late In the
afternoon session. In his message Gover
nor Higgins said:
"The unfortunate scandals already
made public by the Internal dissensions
In the Equitable Life Assurance Society
and by the comprehensive Investigation
of its affairs by the Superintendent of In
surance have, not without jurisdiction,
aroused a feeling 1 of intense alarm in the
breasts of thousands of our citizens who
have invested their money in policies of
life Insurance and of thousands of non
residents who have been taught to re
spect the New. York companies as safo
and secure. Though the business of life
insurance, as at present conducted, la
subjected to State supervision and regu
lation, it Is evident that the earnings
which should . be credited to the policy
holders may be diverted to other pur-
" poses; that expense of operation may be
extravagant and wasteful; that unwise
investments may- be legally made, and
that the trustees may deal indirectly with
>t he trust funds for their personal ad
vantage. ' That such a condition of af
fairs can exist casts discredit upon the
State.
"It is apparent, that our insurance law
is in some particulars Inadequate and
that the management of the funds of
these ' great companies is not . sufficiently
safeguarded. The State owes a duty to
policyholders and beneficiaries beyond
that of comparing assets and liabilities
and permitting the companies , to justify
their existence by their exhibition of a
satisfactory balance sheet and the prompt
payment of losses. Investments must be
restricted, salaries must be held to a
stricter accountability and the policy
holders must be given a more effective
share, in the government of the compa
nies. It may. well be that the harsh and
arbitrary remedy of dissolution and re
ceivership should be made not only a
penalty for insolvency, but also a sum
mary check upon a solvent company
when It becomes irredeemably the play
thing of lawless greed. The State can
not permit the subjects of its supervision
to exist as licensed prodigals of other
people's money without becoming an ac
complice to the offense.
"We cannot judge all life insurance
companies by the sins of one. A revision
of our Insurance law is necessary, but it
should be made after careful study has
been given." .

Hancock, who was widely known
throughout the United States, had been
a resident, of this city for several years.
He had amassed a large fortune from
royalties from a patented plow which
bore his name. He was known as one
of the most reckless 'automobile 'drivers
in the city. He had been in court on
different occasions for driving his ma
chine in excess of the speed limit, and
on one occasion, a few months ago, was
fined $150 for fast driving. He paid his
fine at the time with a check which tie
insisted should bear the inscription across
its face: '"For driving an automobie sixty
miles an hour in the city of Los Angeles."
On the occasion of the flight of
Knabenshue's airship from Chutes
Park to Pasadena Hancock drove his
machine in a wild race with the air
ship across the country at a speed of
fifty miles an hour. More recently he
attracted notice by racing- his machine
for fifteen miles against the Scott spe
cial train on the Santa Fe on its record
breaking trip, when he drove the ma
chine at the rate of a mile per miqute.

".' KANSAS CITY. July 20.â The . City
.National: Bank' failed to qpen its doors
.to-day^ -The bank; held -paper of C. J.
Devlin of Topeka' to. the amount of :up^
wafd'bf^lOO.OOO, and the failure, is the
direct, result of the.clpslng of 'the '.First
'National, Bank, of Topeka, of I. which
: Devlin was the principal stockholder. -/.
Up to the close of banking hours ho
flurry affecting, other local Institutions;
had followed the failure. Nothing bor-'
dering on a rim. was experienced', at any,
of the local % banks and .according to
-the offlcersat each place none. 'was. ex-!
pected. . The City, National had been .in,
a weakened "condition for. some time.
Its; failure, had been anticipated.-; and.
therefore- no v surprise -was K shown ::-. in
banking circles to-day .when'theV an
nouncement was made that'it had been
taken.in charge by National Bank* Ex-
aminer. Ames. V Neither ; Ames nor'ithe
bank's officials or its attorneys were in
a position to make a definite statement
regarding the bank's condition.
The failure of the City National Bank
of Kansas City was due in a great
measure' to the fact that it held upward
of $100,000 of C. J. Devlin paper,, which
isTtled up in the recent failure of the
First, National Bank of Topeka, , of
which- Devlin jvas the principal stock
holder. Another Kansas : City ' bank
which held Devlin's paper Is the Amerr
lean National. C. J. Jones, president
of the American National, said that the
paper held at the time of the failure
had been purchased since then, from the
American. National by Its directors.
Therefbre' it was stated that there was
no ; cause for a run on the bank. It
was" announced by a member, of the
Kansas City' Clearing-house that no
Mother Kansas City bank would be per
mitted to! fail and that the clearing
house -Would gladly ' have aided the

carrled-so "much bad paper.

ure;" up tb r 'the closing^ hour, to-night.
Telephoae messages from both points
stated' that the banks would not close.
Some time' ago the Comptroller of
the Currency at "Washington Instructed
the officers of the City National Bank
to s repair Its capital. This was done by
borrowing from a local capitalist. Fol
lowingthe failure of the First National
Bank at ; Topeka the Kansas City caplr
"talfst -'became insistent ; for the repay
ment ; : of.i his loan, and) this demand
caused the -officers of the City National
to decide upon closing their institution.
5 The, City ' National Bank was organ-
Ized-in 1900; and is one of .the young
est of .the national banking institutions
in the city.* Its capital is $300,000 and
Itvhas deposits of : $1,476,648. Its of

WITHDRAWALS BY DEPOSITORS.
Although the holding of Devlin paper,
upon". which no immediate realization
could: be made, was the prime cause of
the failure, it Is stated that' the gen
eral knowledge that the bank held
other bad. paper and was In a weakened
condition has led to a general .with
drawal of .deposits. At no time had a
ran of any big proportions been on, but
It is was . stated withdrawals had been

word: from Police j Officer Thomas ! Bro'ad
nead of -Los Angeles to the Â«ffectÂ«that he
knew, of the whereabouts ; of a!'counter
.feiter who had escaped while en route to
prison, and an inquiry..by. Hazeh; satisfied
him that the suspected man was Gregory,
who was arrested in; Oakland in .March.

Work Is soon. to, he started on the con
struction of the new immigration station
on Island, tort which "the Govern
ment has "appropriated '1200,000. It was
stated last evening by Frank Sargent,
chief* of ithe .-UhltW*.! States' Bureau of
Labor and Comnnerce. who ii staying at
the St:A Francis Hotel,- ; that - Secretary
Taft, who inspected the Angel Island sits
during ,hl3,recenl-vl3lt here, has Instruct
ed the department at Washington to for
mally cede to _ the -Bureau of. Labor and
Commerce ten "acres of land on the Island,
where the -new structures are to be built,
and the; work bf^grading and building of
the" necessary S wnarves | will be begun in
a few days. .Discussing his -plans last
evening Chlet Sargent said: : â¢
It will probably . bÂ« . a w?ek or.Â«o before wÂ«
have definitely '\u25a0 decided ''on thÂ© number and
style of buiftyngs to be erected .on the island.
A rchitect :Wi.:^; Matthe-wa of Oakland, to
whom has j been assisted the task oC de
signlng>the buildings, -and â¢ my*elf. baver' beea .
hoidtng dally conference* regardlns these build
ings; the majority oÂ£-which..will be constructed
of wood. - As yet we have not decided whether
to^tfuild one" bis building that .'will include
all -the necessary accommodations for detained,
people \u25a0 and 'qtrartfers "for "officers; as was dona
in" Honolulu, .-or to. erect separata buildings.
Mr. Matthews has 'prepared plans for both and
It will: not take. : us ' long ; to decide now that
the \u25a0 preliminary 'work is about to be started.
The wharres will be built In what Is com
monly known .'is China ' Cove, a well sheltered
place â¢on "tfie -northeastern side of the- Island,
and ''one "of the first buildings to be erected,
will b e the - one* tn" which pomplng machinery
is to be located. I have figured that it will
take about fifteen months to have the station
in readiness -for service.
As soon as it la ready the department will
abandon the miserable detention shed at the
Mall dock which has been the source of much
jU3tlflable*complaint. and It is more than Hke'y
that after wÂ« have thoroughly Installed the
officials of the department at the Anger Isl- '
and station we will try to persuade Congress
to give the bureau an appropriation for a boat
In which we can transport our own supplies
and remove passengers from the island after
their period of detention has expired. I In
tend to Â«Â«e mjr best efforts to hurry to com
pletion the ne.w station, which this harbor
is sorely I m need of and which will ba a
credit to the Government In every .respect.

GUNSHU PASS, Manchuria, July 20.â
Since a month ago, when the army was
under the impression that it was about
tv advance, tne commanders have been
nodi annoyed by talk of peace, but the
aiJi'Ointment of M. de Witte as senior
peace plenipotentiary' appears to have
convinced the commanders of the Gov
ernment's determlnatNtfj^ ''.-' -.:.\u25a0 -
The Russian army rests, as usual, with
cavalry flanks slightly enveloping: the
Japanese, who remain- within their de
fensive lints. A press correspondent
has made a tour paralleling. the Japan
ese position for a distance of'seventy
five miles. Their fortifications jon the
first line bisect Changlufu, on the rail
road, and are growing daily. ..The Indi
cations are that it would cost'one-thlrd
or one-half of the Russian army to take
them, while their second position, .of
equal strength, is eleven miles farther
back, on the hills north ofKaiyuan.
Considerable confidence la evinced
in the strength and size of the Russian
positions, and an example of the "mili
tary spirit of the superior officers is in
dicated in the following declaration" by,
one of the leading commander*;.
I hayÂ« 150 machine guns and also \u25a0 strong
artillrry- I have received many - men from
Russia. AH the infantry companies are \u25a0 250
men strong. ' and all ' m the men are anxious to
attack. Though. the situation la very bad In

ferences, victory, it ifaugt be. .* \. \u25a0- .

The civil and military Red Cross or
ganizations are working well and a
slight increase \u25a0in their facilities will
enable them to care for those suffering
from summer sickness, which is now
the sole malady.
It Is believed the danger of an epi

cause the region occupied by the Japan

RUSSIA FAR FROM BEING CRUSHED.
French Press Urges Japan to Heed tbe
Words of De Witte.
PARIS. July 20.â M. de Witte, who
will arrive here at 4 o'clock to-morrow
afternoon, will be received soon after
ward by President Loubet. The inter
view of Monday with De Witte con
tinues to be one of the chief subjects of
discussion among officials and diplomats
and in the newspapers, xhe Temps
(semi-official) pevotes a column leading
article to it to-night, pointing out the
importance of the Russian statesman's
declarations. The Temps say 3 De
Witte's statement was most important
in recalling that he was a partisan of
peace even, before the war was begunâ
not a mere retrospective partisan â and
because of this he is now in a better po
sition to restore peace than one who as
sisted in the rupture.,
"Moreover," continues the Temps, "M.
de Witte's statement, shows that war
was not inevitable ap*3 that the observ
ance of the wise counsels of M. de Witto
t might have averted* war. This, how
ever, does not mean that M. de Witte is
resigned to make more .cruel sacrifices
than any other negotiator, as he ; is un
able to make concessions beyond a point
which the Emperor himself has fixed.
'â¢It is no 'bluff' that M. de. Witte so
fully develops In his declarations to the
Associated Press. The j Japanese, should
take good account of M. de Witte's state
of mind. Russia, despite, her losses, is
far from being crushed. It- would;
therefore, be absurd for Japan to at
tempt to impose extreme conditions,
and. if exigencies force her to demand
humiliating terms, then the success^of
the. peace negotiations is irredeemably
compromised."

THE SAN^FRANCISCO CALL, FRIDAYS JUIA' 21,-1905:
SOUNDS SLOGAN
OF REVOLUTION
Futility of Appealing
to the Throne Is
Now Apparent.
MOSCOW. July 20.â The Zemstvo Con
gress reassembled " to-day, without ;- in
terference on the Dart of the authorities,
and commenced a discussion of the pro
posed constitution. The meeting was
again held at the residence of Prince
Dolgorukoff.
The first resolution proposed protested
nga'nst the violation of private rights
and the general arbitrariness of the au
thorities. A delegate from Tver, Central
Russia, maintained that the resolution
was not strong enough, and it was finally
referred to a committee to be redrafted.
Later an amended resolution 'was prer.
rented and passed.' It likewise protests
agrainst the constant violation of the pri
vate and social rights of Russian citizens
by administrative officials and calls upon
all local officials to protect the sufferers
from the present state of affairs. and: to
assist in preventing illegal and arbitrary
acts by the authorities^ .
The scheme for a constitution, as
elaborated by a committee of the Con
gress, was next discussed and the details
criticized by the delegates. The chief
points raided were the omission of ade
quate proportionate ' representation â¢ and
the non-recognition of female suffrage.
By ( a vote of 220 to 7. the Congress then
passed the first reading of the project
&s submitted, and copies of it will now
be distributed for examination and dis
cussion. The Congress rejected a pro
posal that, after the -re-examination, of
the project, the Zemstvos organize a
general petition thereupon to the Em
peror.
M. Petrunkevitch. president of the Mos
cow Agricultural Society declared that all
hope resrardiner the Government's scheme
which had hitherto :".been nourished had
proved vain. Everything was going on
in the same old way and it was difficult
to say whether the ' Zerristvoists really
intended to work in the.n ational Inter
est. It was obvious, he said, that the
bar separating " the Emperor and \u25a0 the
people was too strong, and that they
could not count on reforms from above.
They had appealed to the Emperor and
theyshould now appeal to^ the people.
' Prince Rostkovski said that the speech
of M. Petrunkevitch was: a direct incite
ment to a revolution i and left the hall.
Prince Dolgorukoff; repudiated Prince
Rostkovski's construction" of . M. Petrun
kevitch's speech! which, he said, only
echoed what had been set forth in the
memorandum presented by ' the marshals
of the nobility to the Emperor.

Point in Effort to Have
Warrant Declared Invalid
s. VICTORIA. . B. C, July 20.â George ; D.
Collins. - : who began his \u25a0 fight against ex
tradition to-day to San Francisco for
perjury before Judge Lampman, said '[ he
intended to question the extradition treaty
between the United- States and Canada,
holding, that by it perjury, cannot be held
to \u25a0 be an : extraditable -'offense. ; ' He I said
h.e understood: witnesses | were gj to be
brought \u25a0 from San Francisco, but as he
and .his counsel proposed to/^show the
authorities that the; charges -of perjury
as^ laid against, him could not be proven
under the laws of Canada, as , It > must
be to secure his extradition their presence
would be unnecessary.. He claimed that
the Ashburton treaty 'omits \u25a0: perjury in
its list of extraditable crimes. V. ;' *'
His contention involves the validity of
the treaty of ISS6. He would also show
that' the new treaty, of IS9O, in whichrper-.
jury was - mentioned for Lthe ; first .time
as an extraditable offense, was - not cap
able of being enforced, as no legislation
was made to put it into effect. His contend
tion woulu involve the. presentation of a
large number of authorities, he, having
come into court with his arms' laden
with books. Previous to this statement
by Collins, several hours had , been spent
in arguing objections, most on technicali
ties, by Collins and his counsel, .; Collins
fighting each point tooth and nail, ad
mJttJrig nothing. In opening ; the case
Attorney Higgins for the San Francisco
police applied to amend the information
upon which the warrant for Collins' \ ar
rest was made, making it in keeping with
other informations and .; the warrant
brought from San Francisco by Detective
Gibson for Collins, and his < counsel ob
jected strongly, though without result.
Collins objected strenuously to the'ad
mission of the warrant issued by District
Attorney Byington of San Francisco and
brought by Detective Gibson," claiming it
was not properly certified.' He held a
certificate should have accompanied . it,
verified by the Secretary of State, and
advanced' in support a. 'case, in; which a
similar objection was made and' the Judge
then' held the document ; in question had
to be certified by the Secretary of State
and his signature certified by the. British
Embassador. He held that the warrant
was not- admissible. \ Higgihs .said he
would % properly verify the document he
presented with the necessary; evidence.
Further argument was proceeding when
the court suggested the documents be put
in evidence subject to objection and de
cision thereon given later. ' .
Detective Gibson was examined andhe
swore that the warrant; produced by him
was the original one and. duly authenti
cated. He swore to; the: signatures of
the clerk of the San Francisco court
thefeon by his deputy. He also identified
Collins. Higgln 1 ? then produced the certi
ficate ; of . the i California j State \ Secretary
authenticating the documents which bore
the California seal.
Collins objected .to each document.
After citing i the '. n&jture ,,ot <; the charge
against Collins. Hlggins went on to read
the deposition which set forth I that \ Col
lins had intermarried:;': with" Charlotte
Newman and j that 'his" statements sworn
to in denial of the maintenance action
that he was not married to her was will
fully and- corruptly .false. Collins - con-:
tinued his objections, among them, being
an objection to the evidence of Charlotta
Collins on the ground that the person
claimed to be the wife of the accused
and a wife's evidence was not admissible.

Is a son of General Cassius M. Clay, the

store drivers will be reinstated.' and the
express drivers declared to-night that
they believed that about 100 of their
number would be taken back by the
express companies..
The express companies have declared
all through the strike, however, jthat
not one of the men who struck would
ever be reinstated.
To-morrow the truck drivers and one
or. two smaller unions' will vote on the
question of calling off the strike, and
there is no doubt that they will decide
to, seek their old. places. The officials
of ;tho teamsters'J union declare that
they expect such action to be taken.
. The only concession' that the men
have gained by going back to work is.
In the case of the lumber drivers, the
right to wear the union button. In tnÂ»
case of all other unions the men. by
seeking their old, places, tacitly agree
to "the terms of the employers, -which
were that only such men would be taken
back as. were needed after the non

that the question of wearing the union

One of the maoy familiar, names of

fact that scratching is so disagreeable
that people thought it no worse than
the <rvil one. A scalp full of dandrnff
keeps one scratching- all the time; not
only disagreeable, but .considered very
Inelegant in polite societyâ as it should
beâ because one ought to keep the scalp
bo clean that it would not itch. To cure
the scalp of dandruff effectively/ use
Newbro's Herplcide 'It kills the germ
that creates the dandruff, which is pre^

BATTLE ARRIVE HERE
Eight Witnesses of Contest of Fleets in
Straits of Tsushima, oh Coptic. ,
HEAD OF THE UXITEO STATES SECRET SERVICE "WHO 'HAS , BEEN SEEK
ING COUNTERFEITERS IN THE ORIENT AND AN ITALIAN JOURNALIST.
\u25a0WHO rs RETURNING TO MILAN FROM THE. SEAT. OF WAR. ;
Eight Bur\ivorc of the great naval bat
tle of the Sea of Japan, all from the
Russian hospital ship Orel, landed yes
terday from the liner Coptic, which ar
rived Wednesday -nigrht from the Orient.
Among them are two women, nurses, and
they are all going back to Russia as fast
as steam can carry them. .
The story of the Orel's capture at the
beginning of the battle -was told by Dr.
Paris, who arrived here some days ago
on the liner Korea. The Russians who
crossed the ocean on the Coptic have
nothing to add to that tale.
According to the other passengers every
one of the eight was opposed to a fur
ther continuance of the war and some
of them may have the courage to so ex
press themselves when they get back to
the land where to say what one thinks
requires courage. . -
Mrs. Olga Yourlleff and Miss IC. Lubo
widzska are the ' two nurses." Mrs. Your
lleff is the daughter of a Russian admiral
and is said to have lost a brother in
the najral fight. The Russians Join with
Dr. Paris In condemning Japan's action
In firing on and capturing the red cross
ehlp Orel, but they all have brought
from the Orient a very wholesome respect;
for the little brown gunners who blew
away the Czar's naval reputation. .

"I have nothing to say about what the
admiral reported as to the! condition of
the ships. In regard to his criticism of
the discipline, I*, have only this to say:
Whatever was lacking In that respect
was the direct result of the admiral's
own incapacity arid any criticism comes
from him with a bad grace. If the gun
ners of the fleet did not know their busi
ness the commantier-In-chlef â¢ should be
ashamed to acknowledge it, for either he
was neglectful in not. knowing what his
men could do, or, if he was aware of
their incapacitj', he convicts himself of
criminal neglect of his duty in not seeing
that the weakness was remedied."
The officers from the Orel who arrived
on the Coptic are Captain J. Lachmatoff,
commander of the hospital ship;. Baron
Osten-Saken, paymaster; S. Kostromltin

and Surgeons G. Borsl and W. L. Ascher

FLEE WHILE LITTLE DAMAGED.
At Manila the Coptic's officers . saw. the
Oleg, Zemchug and Aurora, the three
Russian : cruisers which escaped the fate
of the other, ships of the Czar by leaving
the scene of action at a twenty-three knot
gait..The Oleg.was hit fourteen times and
was pretty thoroughly perforated. Ameri
can navy officers, however, who had
visited and carefully examined all three
of the vessels, freely expressed the" opin
ion that for fighting purposes they were
as good as ever and that the American
navy would feel that it had been forever
disgraced IT a. vessel flying the stars and
stripes, and no more seriously*' hurt than
were these Russians, had run away from
the enemy as did tljeOleg,* Zemchug and
Aurora. ' .
John.E; Wilkie, chief of the United
States Secret Service, was a passenger
on the. Coptic. ; He has been in the Philip
pines trying to run down the counterfeit
ers who have been very. Industrious since
the new Philippine coins, were issued.
What he found out or what he did will
not be discovered by any unofficial ques
tioner. Wilkle's ability " to " say nothing
gracefulry placed him at tho'head of
Uncle Sam's detective department and as
far as Wilkie is concerned the service is
strictly "secret."
L. Barzinl, who has been at the i front
for the Corrlere della Sera of Milan, re
turned on the Coptic. â¢ He was the only
correspondent at â¢ the second j battle <of
Mukden and secured not only some thrill
ing war stories for his paper, but-what
are said to be the finest photographs
ever taken on' a battlefield. Barzinl
operated his camera side by side .with one
of Japan's busiest artillery 'batteries and
some day soon he hopes >to > publish a
pictorial story of. as much of the war as
he saw. He sent plates and films back
to Italy and. is now. on his way ; after
them. . . - â¢ - â¢ . \u0084

Give* Account of Affairs Which Put
Him* In Wrong; Light Before
Judge Waste.
OAKLAND. July 20.â Attorney N. J.
llanson of San Francisco, who objects
to the light In which he has been
placed in a cause in Judge Waste's
court, has written the following self
explanatory letter to The Call:'
. SAN FRAXCISCO. July 20.
To the Editor of Ttoe Call:
My attention has this moment been called
to a publication in your Issue of yesterday,
the lÂ»th whtre under the. caption "LiwyÂ«r
Scored by JudgÂ« Waste," you say that Judge
\u25a0Waste after commenting: on Manson's breach
or faith in raising a technical objection to the
trial of a case in vacation, -which he had
agreed to try, receives a grilling by the court.
I was not present in court on the 18th of
July, the day set for trial of the case, and
only knew of -what transpired from your state
ments. The following letter, received by mÂ«,
from the attorneys on the other side of the
case, on the morning of July 17, and post
marked Oakland. Cal.. July 15, 6 p. m.
<which was Saturday) is self-explanatory and
demonstrates the injustice of your own re
marks and these imputed to Judge Waste:

"'Jf. J. Manson, Esq., Attorney-at-Law, San

"Dear Sir: We shall hare to ask to have
thÂ» trial of the case of Halle vs. Htowell post
poned from Tuesday until our tlemurrer to
the cross-complaint 1Â« disposed of, but |we
would like to ha%'e this demurrer heard on that
day If agreeable to you. Tours very truly.
y "SKOOK & CHURCH."
"Dictated by J. W. S. (Stetson)."
No demurrer had been filed to the cross
complaint until some time after the case had
been set for trial. Attorneys on the Other
side had expressed themselves as intending to
answer at once the "cross-complaint.- Later on,
they themselves put in. what is. generally
called, a time demurrer alleging that the cross
complaint doe* not state sufficient facts. The
first intimation I had that the other side
wished to take up the demurrer oa that date,
was on the morning or July 17. I at cnce
railed at the office of Messrs.- Snook and
Church and stated to them that, as the cans*
was not at Issue. I should, of course, not re
eist their motion for a continuance; that so
far as the demurrer was concerned I could not
proceed x>n ens day's notice and the matter
ehould come up regularly In the law and
motion calendar. This seemed entirely agree
able to the office. I was also informed that
neither Messrs. Snook nor Church could bÂ«
present: that both were away in the country
It Tvould'eeem to mÂ« that Mr. Stetson could
not hayÂ« Informed thÂ« court of hlÂ» letter to
me of Jnly 14. postmarked Oakland. July 15.
6 c m-V and received by me July 17, but on
tbe contrary In a matter which I had left
exclusively with his office, he must have been
rstremrly tx-parte In his statements and may
have Imposed upon the credulity of the Judge,
for he had only to look at the paper* In the
ease Ondepenflently of Mr. Stetson's letter) to
Â»cc that the case was not ready for trial.
I will say further that I did not represent
Mm. P. S. Haile. but a Grand Army man. an
old BOldier. who had been deprived of his en
tire property by technicalities. I further state
I did not asree to try the case Jn vacation
unless the pleading In the caÂ«Â« were settled
before the day set for trial. Very truly yours.

sand dollars to material men and lum
ber mills.
Architect C. M. Cook, through whom

was aware of some domestic trouble in
Little's home which may have caused
him to conclude to absent himself for
a while. Mrs. Little left their house
on July 13. She called there for the
last time Saturday afternoon and took
a pet canary and a" satchel away. When
she did not return that night Con
tractor Little wept in the presence of
his next door neighbor. E. T. Paine, a
painter, who. had worked for Little. .
The contractor was seen Tuesday
evening in San Francisco by Fred Foss
of Berkeley, who at that time did not
know that Little had locked the doors
of his dwelling and gone away. ...
Among those seeking the absent con
tractor are Manager Brown of the Bay
Shore Lumber Company, Architect
Cook, J. E. Farnham, Mrs. F. Corkhill,
Mrs. E. L. Dick and some others whose
buildings Little has not completed. "
\u25a0Before leaving Oakland Mr. Little

HIS INNOCENCE
H. J. Nims Maintains He i Per

tion on Cunningham Girl
STUiL SITS IN PRISON
Case of Accused Physician
to Be Transferred From
Cabaniss to Conlan To-Day
I Dr. Herbert J. Nims, the San Jose phy
sician accused of .complicity in .the mur
der of pretty Gladys Cunningham,' the
young girl wno died in the squalid rooms
of Dr. Frank Thomas- In the old Supreme
Court building: on' last Monday night, as
the result of a criminal operation, is still
lodged in a;cell of the City, Prison. Yes
terday mornine he was arraigned before
Police Judge Cabaniss, but at hit; own re
quest-his case was continued until this
moining. It will, probably be transferred
lo " Judge Cbnian's court, - where Dr.
Thomas awaits his-hearlng. His bail was
fixed at $5000, but up to a late hour last
night^the necessary bondsmen were^not
\u25a0forthcoming. \ '
Dr. Nims is apparently a middle-aged
man with /gray hair. He stoutly main
tains his Innocence of any crime and de
nies that he, knew that a crime was to
be committed, j He is the' physician of
the Cuhningham family and from all re
ports .'s a trusted man in San Jose. \u0084
All day yesterday Dr. Nims. was kept
busy receiving visitors In the. City Prison.
His wife earned first and for two hours
they sat and, talked over the terrible
affair. At tim;s during this vis'Y Dr.
Nims rrew excited ana with his ,fists
clenched he talked vehemently' to her,
all the time maintaining his Innocence.
STRAIN; TELLS OX PHYSICIAN.
The strain of the past few days has
told on his physical strength' and hr is
worn and nervous. To a Call reporter
yesterday afternoon he told for the flist
time his connection with the case of the
girl ever since it was first discovered that
she was in deep trouble. \u25a0 The doctor
seemed not to feel the hardship of his
own position as much as he did that of
the sorrowing Cunningham family, whose
real friends he claims to bs. He said:.
I knew the Cunningham family very well,
and It wus because 1 wa3 their family physi
cian that Gladys Cunningham came to me in
her trouble. When she told me that :she
feared that she was in trouble I was shocked
aiio surprised, for sh* seemed such a girlishly
pure little. woman.
."Gladys,' 1 I said to her, "do your parents
know of this?" '-.-.'\u25a0 S
"Mother does,'' she answered, ."but not:my
father. I fcave not dared tell him"
A llltle later the mother tame to mÂ«. ShÂ«
was almost frantic with grief and wanted mo
to help them out of the difficulty.
"Make the children marry," I said, for 1
lovrd Gladys, "it is the only way to save the
name of two cocti families."
FATHER MAKES APPEAL.
Then the girl's father came to me. For some
reason the marriage dlv nut seem about to
take place and lie begged me to do something
for his daughter. 'Oh. hÂ«lp me. out." he
would crj". and htc appeal was piteous. ~
I had luard that Dr. Thomas of San Fran
cisco was a reputable physician and that he
could probably take care of the gtrl In "his
sanitarium. I thought him a thoroughly cap
able man at his profession and I trusted htm
to the utmost. ' '
I advised Mr. Cunningham to send Gladys
to this man. In the meantime the family, had
gonÂ« to Santa Cruz and th-r lather . telegraphed
me to meet the girl at: the station at San
Jose on Monday and take her to San Fran
cisco. I met her on the train and we came
an together. Her condition was serious aud
she neded rfslr.nd ciiet.
I told Dr. Thcmas to spare no expÂ«nse on the
girl and 1 wowld.se* that he was well paid for
his trouble ,1 told him to do all In his power
to make her comfortable. I saw Gladys that
night She was In bed and se'med to be all.
right. Then I went back to my home In San
Jose.
On Gaturday 1 received a telegram -from the
nurse In charge. Faying Gladys was gettlnsr
along nicely.' Then on Monday I receiv-d the
next mestMge:-* It was to come Immediately.
I hurried to San Francisco on the first train,
but I wat>- ton late. The little slrl was dead,
and the police were whisp?rlnÃ that she was
sent Into eternity because a doctor had per
formed a criminal rr<ration.
XO SI.KKP THAT NIGHT.
I was shocked and pained at the death and
at the whisperings of the police. "I tried all
that nleht to call up her people in Santa Cruz
by telephone, but I could not reach them:-. The
horror of the thin? was on my nerves and
all that night- I-was sleepless..- Early, the nrxt
morning I rose and walked down Market
street feeling that unless I could get word to
that afflicted family soon. I would walk there
myself. That morning her father and brother
came.
That was all that I had to do with the
cafe.' Then 1 ..was arrested In San Jose. . I
performed no operation on Gladys and her peo
ple will bear me out In thi* statement. I did
not bring her to San Francisco with the inten
tion that .euch an operation should t>v per
formed, nor did I have the slightest idea that
euch a thlnsr vrnuid be the. result;. ' .?,; '
:I brought her her*- for . "tie ; reason only.
The child was maddened at her condition . and
we- feared that she mlsht' attempt her life.
UTider the terrible strain of the: thought â¢ that
she was the first to bring \u25a0 disgrace on the
heads of a good family she had become terribly
nervous and we nil felt that; she needed to be
placed somewhere where she could recover In
rest -and <iulÂ«t and at t the same time be
witched that - she did not attempt her own
life.' And so I brought her to ; Dr.- Thomas.
I do not know t!:at there \u25a0was a; criminal
operation. I cannot believe that, Dr. Thomas
did It. It In not at all Impossible that Gladys
committed Ihc ilMd herself In ' th-t hopes of
savlne the famllv from <liKffracc_-*'- s
All -will.como out. right -In :th* end and I
have no f<?r-r for myself. Inm only sorry for

Dr. Thomas could ! not be [foun^ yes

.Alexander â¢ W. ; / ; McPherson, , better
known as , "Brick" r McPherson, occupies
a cell in the city \ prison, and it is likely
that he is' there to' stay- for a whiFe,
judging from the .twenty-six charges of
obtaining money; '-by.'- false pretenses
that Detectives - Matherson and Mulcahy
will register â¢ opposite ( his name "to-day.
"Brick," who' has f kept : shy of 1 trouble
for some time past, beguiled" John Shee
han, a laborer, intof parting 'with $132 50
on the golden promise of- $7,000,000 profit
on an rpium smuggling ' transaction^
Sheehan has listened, 'to 1 the ':tale3 :"ofj
fabulous 'gain since May 10, but' as-he
only; played the part of the willing pro
ducer and realized 'no results. hÂ« con
sulted the police 'and McPherson â¢' was
taken into custody.. \u25a0;
McPherson's method .of separating the
unsuspecting stranger from his coin was
unifjne, though by no means new to the
"cliemer. The" two â¢ men \u25a0' became ac
quainted in' thevTremont 'lodging I house
on Kearny street, between^ California
and Sacramento^ - McPherson, v/hosclast
occupation . has been - that" of -' a â¢ hack
driver, worked lnto^ the â¢ confidence. -of
the other and -they- became very, friendly.'
On May 10 McPherson told Sheehan t that
there was some ; stuff at the Pacific : Mail
dock which the captain, of the steam
ship Siberia wished -him -to, bring: up
town.. lie said he had no money- with
which to 'accomnllsh- this -and without
any effort succeeded In relieving Sheehan
of $7 50. He 'returned In a: short' time
with an excu?e and 'got ?2 50, more. . In
return for his' kindness he was to re
ceive o-jshare of \u25a0 the: 1 profit"' from the
merchandise which" r .the captain ', desired
removed, but Sheehan did not at this
time know what the "merchandise" con
sisted of. â¢ ' â¢ ' â¢ -
SHKBHAX irAXDS OVER COIX. '
McPherson's. way seemed to have been
barred by . many 7 obstacles. He:.'told a
series of hard luck" stories and I?Shee
han's purse always'responded.' '.\u25a0 On . May
1G the laborer examined. his account with
the ex-hack driver, -and found It thus:
May 10; $7 50;:'M9y'10,.52 50: May 11. $10 50:
May 11, $2; ' May : . 12. ,$6 50'; May - 13,

14, $14 50; May 15, $17 60; May 15, $14 oO;
May 16, $4 50. ; Questions were asked and^
McPherson then whispered ""that the'
"merchandise'! In question , was opium,
that a ring composed "of Purser Mc-
Lean. Inspector J.Nagel. Chief Engineer
Waters. E. Danforth,' \V. W. English,
Tom, Woo & Co.; Kirn L.ong & Co., the

protested and â¢ refused to :: lend ; further
financial "aia-to : the illicit business, Mc-
Pherson' tbia him that he -had already
violated the law and ; that If he aban
doned the v scheme mow he would \j be
exposed.'"
Sheehan,- being -"Unsophisticated -in the
ways of opium rings,~consented. to con
tinue in the game f and his memorandum
of expenditures from that date if as
follows: May 17, $4 50; May 21, ,$10; ; June

financing the deal: ;.

SCANDINAVIAN WAR.
WE are sure that the world regrets the rising war spirit in
Sweden. King Oscar, who is a wise man, had accepted the
secession of Norway with' the philosophy of a statesman.
Around him in the North "are the lessons taught by the enforced
union of peoples and nations. Poland, choking with exasperation
against Russia and .murdering her masters by stealth, is part of
that lesson. Finland; struggling against the same master, with
her Northern blood boiling, is a nearer part of the same Jesson.
So Oscar declared that a forced union with Norway would be^ a
â¢mistake and it would be better to let the erring sister go in peace;
This appeared to be also the temper of the Swedish people. They
were unexcited and took the situation as calmly as their King.
After all, the union had been one of equality. Each nation
had its own Parliament. and constitution. Their common interests
were attended to by the council of state, in which their representa
tion and rights were equal. Each enjoyed home rule and was free
to obey the promptings of its individual genius. To the distant
observer no loss to Sweden is visible. King Oscar lost only his
exercise of a limited executive authority over Norway.. Of course
this means the loss of dynastic prestige. But he is too sensible a
man to c?.re for that, except as he may be chafed by the ambitions
of his family. â¢
Why Sweden should want war and what the expected prize of"
victory is, do not clearly appear. ' One must look outside of the
Scandinavian peninsula for the cause of the war spirit among the
Swedes. Since the Kaiser interfered in the matter the change has
occurred. German agents in Sweden are inciting the passion of
the people, and Sweden begins to talk about honor, national honor,
being involved in whipping Norway back. This is most unfortu
nate. The Swedes are very unsophisticated if they think this im
perial interference is for their good. The other nations have pur
sued a hands-off policy that has bqen sufficiently embarrassing for
Norway, because it keeps her entirely cut off from official inter
course with the rest of the world.
In one respect the nations, republics, kingdoms, empires and
autocracies are alike. They know each other through their execu
tive heads only. In our own republic neither the legislative nor the
judicial co-ordinate branches of the Government can have any au
thoritative contact or communication with a foreign nation. That
can only be through the President. Norway has her Legislature
and her" judiciary, and her internal administration goes pn in perfect
order. But she* has lost her head, so to speak. She has cut off
the executive branch of her government and has neither eyes to see,
ears to hear or mouth to speak, concerning those things external that
affect her interests. She will remain in this condition until some
nation recognizes her executive. The Kaiser took advantage of this
condition to incite the Swedes to war. Sweden can get air the
national and international rights. Norway cannot. Sweden can
borrow a war chest by means of a national loan, negotiated abroad.
Norway cannot make a foreign loan, for she has no national ex
istence* in an international sense. Her warships cannot have the
brief refuge of twenty-four hours in a neutral port, and she can
have no belligerent rights. If under such circumstances she is
challenged to battle she will have the world's sympathy. THe
opinion will be general,that the German Emperor might be in better
business than inciting war between these two bantam-weights. But
he seems to desire, war for the sake of its complications.
The sympathy between Denmark and Norway is stronger than
between Sweden and Denmark. War on the peninsula might give
him the coveted chance to seize Denmark which has been the am
bition of Germany ever since the battle of -Duppel,;in 1864. ;Then
the absorption of Holland and Belgium might follow, and the
German provinces of Austria would be the next prize. No matter
where the trouble begins, nor what nation can be induced tO: singe
its paws in pulling the ' Kaiser's chestnuts out of the fire, he hopes
to win if trouble can be started.
AS OTHERS SEE US.
NOT to our own eyes only, but to all the rest of the United
States, San Francisco is "The Coming City." Even Boston
frankly and enthusiastically acknowledges, that ours is "The
City Beautiful" â that there is none other which' can cbijhpare with
it in splendid possibilities of adornment, and in realities' of natural
beauty of situation.
The Boston Globe bears witness to these truths in an editorial
which does not treat the subject as one that needs restraint from
superlatives. Although we already know it, it is pleasing to hear
from the pens of others that San Francisco is soon to be added to
the list Of the beautiful cities in the world; that landscape artists
believe our city can be made more beautiful than much admired
Naples; that our terraced hills, adorned with handsome residences,
and aided by floriculture, woul/1 surpass the loveliness of the streets
and steps of that far-famed pride of Italy.
In exulting over that last mentioned item of beauty, namely,
the aid of floriculture, we are again allowed to use the superlative.
"In no place on earth," says Mr, Burnham, the expert in city adorn
ment-who is planning our evolution into the foremost place of cities
beautiful, "can be repeated with success the French and- Italian
ideas for beautiful gardens. True, theirs were formal, merely archi
tectural, but here the opportunity for informal gardening appeals
to all."
The subject the Boston paper was considering when it was led
by enthusiasm into such praise of San Francisco was that of city
improvement. It remembered our plans and used them for illus
tration. They are the. well known, ones of The Association For the
Improvement and Adornment of. San Francisco, formed a year ago,
and now numbering 450 members. What that association, intends
to dp, J aided by the specially trained and experienced esthetic
talents of Mr. Burnham^ spreads itself out in a grand prospect of
beauty before the mind's' eye. There is our civic center-with its
great theater and beautiful conservatory of music, with the" broad
boulevards reaching out from it, one to the .Golden Gate Park and
one by the water â¢ side toward the Golden Gate, till it joins the
driveway south of the Cliff House; there is the magnificence of the
series. of steep and terraced hills adorned with mansions and flower
gardens; together with all the natural glories of a landscape, bound
ed on th^ee sides by the bay and the ocean, improved to the utmost
by the arts-in architecture, parks and gardens.

That the world runs to the bad,
In its foolish, reckless way; .
But the stars refute the lie.
Whlsp'ring. "You with peace may
sup.
It is coining by and bye."
Better keep a-looking up. .
I CAN RISE AGAIN.
THERE is one great lesson the
world has taught-
To l me. as I Journey here.
The way may be rocky and - pitfall
fraught,
And my scars may a sight appear.
I may fall, and fall, and fall once more.
As even the weakest of men, ~:
But though I am hurt and my wounds
are sore, "
I always can rise again.
I know that my stumbling feet may
stand ;*. \u25a0
Where' the chasm is just before;
With another step I may leave the land,
And the blackness fold me o'er.
I have fallen oft, and again . shall fall.
For little the way I ken,
But never shall Failure â¢ hold me
thrallâ
I surely can rise again. .
ONCE there. | was a " good and noble
man who was about to travel, and he
said: "I do not believe in the, tip sys
tem, for It lowers the standard of man
hood and makes sycophants.- or worse, or
those who would be men. Therefore, will
I honorably pay my way, but I will give
no tip."^.
So the good and noble man traveled,
and he did as he had said.
Where is the man now, do you ask?
He is dead. Rufus. He starved to
death., '
â¢ Moral: So will you if you hold principle
as more than comfort and. adopt his plan.
THOUGH v the raindrops \u25a0 patter your
house is dry.
And the might of the storm It will
still defy;
Though without be the rain and its cease
less, din.
You are snug and cozy, and warm within.
For your house is roofed.
But the city's houseâ don't say a word.
But vote as you please, though your
vote's absurd,
And your medicine take, as you ought
to do
lt Isn't as If we never knew
Our house is Reufed. .
ONE man is born genial and optimis
tic, my boy, and- another is born
.sour and pessimistic, and :so%they- go
through life,- ontf receivelng blessings and
the other curses. Yet from one point ot
view neither rot these two is entitled to
either much praise or much discredit. Is
a crow to blame for being black, or a
peacock commendable for having a hand
some tail?
'Tis one point of view, I say, but It
is a rather perverted one. An ornithologi
cal Burbank might bo combine two birds
that each of them would have; some of
the qualities of the other. Well, It so
happens... if you care to term it ; a hap
pening, that each of us Is both the bird
and the Burbank of 'his own existence.
He Is bora in a certain form, fee cannot
entirely- lose It, but /he can modify it.
He can very largely leave a quick temper
behind him, and if he bows at the altar
of. selfishness he can refuse to . bend a
knee though it creak witlKthe desire.
Here endeth j the first | lesson,, and' if It
be quite unheeded, wherein . will it differ
from most lessons? . -

MIRROR OF DAME FASHION
TOILETTE FOR A SUMMER AFTERNOON.
SOME very. smart features of the newer fashions are . exemplified in this
dainty toilette, Intended for the garden party, the races or other after
noon amusements. The skirt Is in a. dull shade of Belleek blue-rone of
the porcelain tintsâ with a dot in a darker tint scattered' at wide Intervals
over the-surface. The coat is in a plain silk of the same shade of blue, em
phasizing, the hewer mode of coat and. skirt to contrast rather, than match.
Much use is made of a yellowish batiste embroidery, -this forming: the un
derblouse, and a broad berthe frill that passes around the shoulders, stop
ping short on either side of the vest. \u25a0: The silk Is laid in downward-turning
pleats all around, the contour of the figure being followed exactly and a
very smart. little. basqulne of odd shape is Attached a trifle below the waist
line, to fall in a cascaded postilion in the back.
f The skirt Is a novel design, the soft silk laid in deep pleats at the band,
but these" neither stitched down nor yet pressed. A very full box ruche Is
made of three ribbons of varying width, the one posed flat against the other,
and this ruche Is prised in a double festoon that intersects at wide Intervals
along, the foot "of the skirt. , The dropsklrt is made with the new Paquln
flounce of haircloth, which 'sÂ«rves as a modish foundation for the swirling
fullness of the outer skirt, the hem of which measures in the neighborhood of
some dozen yards. \u25a0 â¢
* The sleeve is one of the elbow persuasion, very full and puffy, and with
a plain band strap catching the fullness over the elbow, and serving: like
wise to top the embroidered batiste frill that makes such a smart finish.

State Harbor Commissioners
Talk of Reassigning Docks
to Steamship Companies
FREIGHT VERY HEAVY
President Spear Reviews
the Request of Pacific
Mail for Additional Space
The building of new piers at the Pacific
Mail dock deprives the steamship com
pany of the use of wharf space at a time
when the freight traffic is heavy. The
Board of State Harbor Commissioners
has been appealed to by the manager of
the company' for additional facilities. The
subject was discussed yesterday by Com
missioners Spear, Mackenzie and Crock
er. A special meeting of the board may
be calied to consider the advisability of
making a general reassignment of docks.
The following communication from the
president of the commission was read at
toe meeting yesterday:
To the Honorable, the Board of State Har
bor Commissioner*â -Gentlemen: In construct
ing j'ltr No. 42 It is going to cause tbe re
tirement from practical use the shipping on
the south tide of the present Pacittc Mail
dock, thereby cutting down half of the pres
ent dockage facilities of the Pacific Mall
Company. From thlÂ« It will no doubt seem
tpparent to the board that something will
ha\e to be done to accommodate tbe enormous
business of the Pacific Mail Company. To
do this will necessitate the consolidating of
other companies who now hold assignments
on lhÂ« various docks alone the water front.
This is a matter that will require thought
end consideration on the part of the board.
for the reason that all those holding asugn
rr.tnts at present claim that they have not
sufficient room in which to transact their
business but, be that as it may. the Tacts
that confront us are that the Pacific Mall
Company has an enormous tonnage and I
euplKj^e It 1s our duty to \u25a0Â«*cor i Â»rv > d*t tt-*
tonnage. It will be certainly necessary, as
v - tear out old wharves and build new ones
(until we have built four or hve), to taÂ£sW
the space now held by other shipping rinns.
I hav e no recommendation to make as to
how we shall go at the readjustment, but
leave that u> the Investigation and proper de
termination of the commissioners. The time
has come for the board to act aad all the
el.Spping Interests will have to assirt us In
rr.eking accommodations for the Pacific Mall
Company. It is not their fault that they
have lost the couth side of the present Pacific
Mail dock, but It Is caused by the construc
tion of Dier No. 42.
Now it Is onÂ« of two thingsâ either stop
constructing or make arrangements as sug-
gt-sted in the first part of my communication.
This matter must receive Immediate atten
tion or the shipping to the Orient will be
very much handicapped. I believe that by
proper adjustment of conditions we can ar
rar.gp *o that everybody can do business, but
<3.j net expect that all will be satisfied. This
OC T.pe sted condition will probabbr last about
ten months or until piers No. 42 and 44 are
ready for use. Respectfully.
CHAS. H. SPEAR. President.
After the communication had been
read there was some talk of assigning
the Mall Company space at Greenwich
street wharf. Tbe suggestion was also
made that facilities might be provided
qi Stpuart-street wharf. Chief Wharf
inger welch reminded the board that the
Alaska Company fleet and the whalers
would *?xpect accommodations at Steu

A lighted match applied to a leaky gas
\u25a0 jet by J. Harl. a Japanese servant, at 41
Stockton street yesterday at noontime
created an explosion in. the room, which
ecnt the window glass out on the street
in a shower of broken fragments.
C A. Clark, the proprietor of the
house, had invited M. Berman, a paper
hanger, to figure on the cost of refresh
ing the walls. It was to permit a bet
ter light that the Japanese applied the
mÂ£Â«.ch, whereupon the explosion oc
curred. The hands, face, neck and arms
of the Japanese were severely burned.
Clark, who stood behind his servant,
received burns about his head, face and
arms, while Berman, who" had Just en
tered the room behind_the other two,
was slightly burned about the hands
Â» and face.
W The explosion, together with a sheet

ANNUAL REPORT
Merchants' Exchange Affairs
for Last Year Are Given
in Detail to the Members
COxVFIDENCE IN METHODS
Actions of Outgoing Direc
tors Are Given Approval
With Strong Resolution
The annual meeting of the members
of the Merchants' Exchange was held
yesterday afternoon, the retiring presi
dent, William Babcock, presiding.
The greater part of the meeting was
taken up with the reading of the presi
dent's annual rer>ort, which went ex
haustively into the business and finan
cial condition of the organization as fol
lows: . . .\ ~
The expanses of the exchange proper, aside
from the building, have amounted to $45,
62* 63, while . the receipt* were $41,133 56,
showing a deficit of $4381 07, of which $1777 60
was lor seven months' rent of our temporary
Quarters on Sansome street. The inspectors'
departiKÂ«it shows a loss for the year of $Â«25.
This is accounted for by the- poor crops and
resultant email amount of grain handled.
It is partly la view of the above deficit
that I earnestly recommend to the Incoming
board that no change be made in the annual
dues, but the main reason for this suggestion
Is that thÂ«re is a floating debt,' which should
be paid before any reduction in dues Is made.
When the new exchange was formed, and
It purchased the old Merchants' Exchange site
for $3C0,C00. it was necessary for the direc
tors, as there was only $liX).<jOO available, to
borrow $110,000 from various public-spirited
Â«oriÂ«rations and individuals, which they suc
ceeded In doing, free of \u25a0 interest, for three 1
years. Of this sum : one-half has -been re
paid, malDly from membership fees. There
fore we have $53,000 on this account as â¢ one
portion of our floating debt. The three years
having expired the lenders have accepted the
notes of the E^banjje, with 4 per cent in
terest since January 1, s 1905. â* -. .-.
purchase: property.
Then, you will remember, we bought the
Pacific Stock Exchange, or the McNear. prop
erty for 1150.C00. .This property was paid for
by the Bank of California and carried by it
for the Exchange. The rear of the lot has
been utilized for this hall, about 40x135 feet.
OfÂ«the 40 feÂ«t on Montgomery Street. 30 feet
were coM to the Security Savings Bank for
$100,000. thus leaving $50,000 still due on this
property, but which, by a favorable arrange
ment we have been able to make with our
bankers, costs us only 2 per cent per annum.
We own tnÂ« entrance on Montgomery street
10 feet wide, the cost of the building on
which, about $12,000, has been advanced by
the Security Savings Bank, who hold a mort
gage on the property, as this frontage Is not
Included In the general mortgage on the build-
Ing. Thus you will see that we really owe
$117,000 as a floating debt. viz. : Balance due
on the $110,000 borrowed, (55,000; balance due
on thÂ« lot purchased. $50,000: cost of entrance
on llontromery -street. $12,000.
For thÂ« cost of construction .of this building
bonds were issued to the extent or $1,500,000,
bÂ«arlcr * net rate of interest of 4 per cent per
annum. Th^ee bonds were sold at $98. to be
issued a* the money wu required. The act
ual -cost as per contracts entered into amount
ed to $1,499,266 63. l
AXXUAL EXPENSES.
Tbe annual rental of the building at present
1* $153,440. There is unrented space of the
estimated, value of $8100 or a total., when
fully ocevpled, of $161.540. The annual cost
of conducting the building Is as follows: In
terest" da bonds. $60,000; taxes. $14,500; run
ning expenses, $54,000; insurance (insured for
$700,000) $3300; Interest on $50,000 at 2 per
Â©â¢nt, $1000; Interest on $55,000 at 4 per cent,
$2200; a total of $135,600. This, when the
few vacant offices are rented, will mean a
profit of $26,340. ,
In the natural course of events we should
Increase our membership by at least twenty
annually, which would give us an additional
$10,000 for membership fees, which can be
applied to the reducing of our floating debt
until January 1, 1807. when, by the pro
visions of our trust deed, we 6hall have to
pay annually 1 per cent Â»f our bond issue,
or $15,000 into the sinking fund. Our float
ing debt should then not exceed $75,000. Our
Interest charges henceforth will be reduced
al the ratÂ« of nearly $100 per month. Our
rentals are never likely to be lower than they
are now, but in the future should be higrher.
During the past year the exchange has gained
twenty-four new members. .
Upon the recommendation of the grain com
mittee Walla. Walla wheat Is now deliverable
on time contracts on equal terms with No. 1
California wheat. â¢ . '
THE STATE'S CEREALS.
The California cereal Improvement commlt
te* was organized some time ago at a meet
ing called by this exchange.- with the view to
the Improvement of the quality and quantity
of the cereals grown In this State. The sum
of Â»2500 was collected and handed over to
the department of agriculture of â¢ the Uni
versity of California and expended by It In
carrying out Investigations during the winter
of 1904-5. This committee presented a bill
to the Legislature, which has become a law,
whereby the sum of $10,000 has been ap
propriated by the State to prosecute these in
vestigations for the next two years. j.
The deplorable outturn of the present har
vest would eeem to make It most important
that this work be continued, to see whether
some meang cannot be arrived at by whlcn
the continued deteriorated yield of our- crops
can bt arrested.'-
The absence of rotation of crops, slovenly
fanning, lack of new seed and the non-use
of ferttil*ers account, in a great measure,. lor
riM>re*tÂ» In the output of the wheat crop. In
}2ETÂ£Â»n5 bÂ£ our wheat was .held In high
esteem^Dy European and other millers and
with care and Intelligent farmins^it could un
doubtedly now be. restored to the- high place
it formerly held.'
The member* hayÂ« signified by postal cards
the time which will be .roost; convenient to
them for meeting here daily.. and as the ma-
JoruV Prefer 1:30 P. Â«.. the' directors .have
named tnlÂ» aÂ» "chanse" hour. >
OBJECT TO PILE BHIDGfi.\ ?.-%' \u0084
At the close of the -reading of."the~re
port, a. resolution was proposed by Louis
Roeenthal commending all the actions
of the outgoing board of directors as ap
pearing in the report, and that they be
recognized and adopted, as the action of
the Merchants' .Exchange. _
Andrew S. Moseiey moved to amend the
resolution by adding 1 the: words "except
In so far as pertained to the action of
the board of directors.. whereby the board
had recommended that a. bridge be built
across the Straits of Carquinez." .i,i - '"\u25a0.
Moseiey gave as a reason for his amend
ment that a protest had been signed by
seventy members of the exchange against
a pile bridge. across the straits.
â¢ President Babcock stated that the ac
tion taken by- the board of directors was
to* the effect that the. growing trade of
San Francisco and' its commercial Inter
ests demanded that there should be a
railroad bridge across the straits. He
further added 1 thatMhe board had no
Intention to prescribe what sort of bridge
ihould be constructed,; and he felt -sure
that the members of the exchange must
recognize the importance of having , a
railroad bridge at the ' point named to
enable '\u25a0 rail \u25a0 commerce /to - pass the point
without the delay and obstructions that
it was now subject to. Even Judge Taft,
he said, had seen the necessity for the
bridge. "
The; amendment was put and lost, and
the resolution was adopted. '\u25a0
Later there was a meeting of directors,
when the election!. of officers took; place,
with the result that = the: following were
elected : i John- A.'- Hooper, president; G.

Rese nt Conduct of City Janitor sv at
Teutonia Hall Meeting.
It is the general talk of the town that
the Mayor, -: in following out. the Ruef
programme is losing all sense of political
sagacity. -The attitude of the Mayor at
the Teutonia Hall meeting in the Thir
tieth district; night before last, was a
grievous disappointment to the members
of -the United Labor League. The repre-.
Bentatives of; the labor organization - ex^
pected to 'hold a quiet,* orderly . meeting
to discuss the advisability of selecting
delegates to -the Union Labor party: nom
inating convention - who i would not take
orders from Ruef." They were naturally
astonished and indignant when they saw
the Mayor and Tom Egan, of the "Board
of Public Works.; enter; the hair at the
head of a throng of janitors and sweep
ers from all parts, of the city. -When the
chairman selected by. the league was
ousted and cast aside, by the rounders the
insult was too great to pc silently borne.
To-day there is a spirit of determination
in the ranks of the- Labor League that
Schmitz and Ruef .cannot subdue. The
sentiment is expressed by. the executive
committee in this form: .; r
The Uniteil . Labor. League desires to
make 'public its position.'
, Tbe. United Labor, League yras and is
organized for the purpose' of opposing:
tbe CltizeuH Alliance,': and tor .the | pur-
I>oÂ«e'of creating:, a free and Independent
political, convention,' free from the In
fluence and control' of one \ Abe lluef , a
politician who never had clven â¢ any
evldence of Intereat In labor, orara'nlzed
or unorganized, until â¢ the election' of
IÂ£ngene E. hobiultz, \u25a0when he became
both' master : of ; the - Mayor and of tbe
Union Labor party. The?last two con
ventions were completely, at i hlÂ» con
trol, nnd ..the' last convention he de
i bauched' and "proutltuted '" to hia vile
pnrpoÂ»eÂ» by. making; It a tail to the Re
publican kite, lv that he succeeded In
electing a lefflalatlve delegation to do
the bidding: of W. P. Herrln. The rec
ords of the last Legislature shovr that
all the Union Labor legislators, ; in
cluding George Keane, tbe Mayor's sec
retary, voted to a man for Herrln's
candidate for United States' Senator.'
To avoid another occurrence of po
litical prostitution - the .United Labor
League organized and proposes und
will submit v list of delegates i to . be
voted in every district of j San . Fran
cisco, uottvlthstanding the . "rough
house" tactic* resorted to, by. Abe- Ruef
last ultlit at Teutonia Hall. .
The object of the rough house was to
prevent more than one ticket .at : the
Union Labor primary, -so that Iluef's
men could vote hla ticket nt the Re
publican primary (fortunately being
unable to vote at both primaries and
then only, once), and thus control both
political parties this year. ."
Xo one knows better than Abe Ruef
that bis army, divided on the day of the
primary between Union Labor, and Re
publican parties, will turn nothing on
either,' and hence the anger and rage
of his place-holders at the rough house
meeting la*t. night} and if the -Mayor
vrent to his home last night with the
feellngr that, by leading a mob of his
employes (-100) and policemen in plain
clothes und breaking up the meeting at
Teutonia * Hall, be bad crushed out any
opposition to Abe Ruef In the Union
Labor party, he counted without his
host. - : " \u25a0;\u25a0_.'
In the old times of political primaries
rough house. proceeding was the popu
lar method of the ; day \u25a0 (a 4 ' 5ch001 .... of
primary politics known. to some of the
older members at last night's meeting).
Buckley, as some of the persons at Teu
touia Hall well knew, used to send out
Big Burns, Shorty Simpson and some
of last night's rowdies to rough house
primary clubs, but it remains for the
political \u25a0 boss of our time' to send out
the .Mayor of Sun Francisco as the
lender of tbe four hundred to steal and
capture halls the use of which vras paid
for by other people's money.
Tbe Insult offered to Union Labor
men at last ' night's meeting jby 'Ruef
In declaring that they must do his bid
ding and that no one should be per
mitted even to protest' against his
graft should arouse . the manhood, re
sentment and sense of justice of every
right-thinking man in this city. -
The United Labor League believes
that It will, and upon primary day,
where there will be no rough house . and
where ballot-box stuffing "will .be^dis
couraged. \u25a0a . ticket of this United j Labor

Election Commission ' Hears Arguments
on Merits of Rival Voting Machines.
After hearing arguments .yesterday
from i epresentatives of the United , States
Standard Voting Machine Company â¢ and
the Dean Ballot Machine Company as: to
the merits of their respective^ machlriei,
the Election Commissioners postponed ac
tion until to-day on the' award , of the
contract to 'frrnlsh 80 machines to the
city. The Standard company was. the only,
bidder, but Senator Frank Leaylit/ repre-.
sentlng the Dean, company, urged, ; the
commission to postpone the award nntll
next year.when his company, would sub
mit a bid and be ready to. supply the ma
chines. . Leavitt claimed > that the Dean
machine was superior, as it could - handle
any number of parties in excess of seven,
while the Standard machine was fitted- up
for.*. 'seven parties only.:--,: v . . --
F. Ketffer and Frank C. Jordan, repre^
sentlng the Standard machine, -said, ar
rangements could be made for eight can
didates for each office in their ' machine
and that the company would' make j any
improvements desired should necessity
arise. Keiffer referred to a -"subtle influ
ence which' had secured the adoption* of
the Dean iriachlne by the- State Voting
Machine Commission," but Leavitt dis
proved the statement by explaining how
Professor C. JU Corey had -been ' engaged
as an expert to- investigate^ the'- merits
of the Dean machine and had reported
favorably upon It.
When the argument ' was I ended ; Com
missioner Voorsanger said he ; was \u25a0' pre
pared to vote in favor " awarding the
contract to -the Standard 'company for
$650 for each hiachfneP- Voofsanger said
that the appropriation- required ; that it
be expended this fiscal year, as the budget
had reduced -"the aiowarice <f or "election
oflicers by $25,000 on the assumption that
the machines would: be "purchased 'at
once. Voorsanger suggested that a clause
be inserted in the contract that* the Stan
dard company make all required improve
ments and that It agree to take back the
old machines at an agreed' allowance
should: any = radical improvement -be made
in the new machines -to be manufactured.
Commissioner Leffingwell'-i said that
Leavitt had raised doubts in "his mind as
to whether the Standard machine would
be able to provide for future contingen
cies, such as there being more than eight
parties in, the field, and on his motion ac
tion was \ postyb'heVl' â¢ until "j this "j afternoon.
Lefflngwell fread a communication from
T. C. Frledlander stating, that he could
not serve as an election judge as he had
not I registered. ? Lefflngwell stated that
Frledlander Was laboring under a misap
prehension, as he was registered on Octo
ber B,' 1904. ..'A'letter was ordered sent to
Friedlarider t notifying \u25a0 him that ' he ; will
be reaulred to.'serve..t .".; . '- "
M. J. Fontana "notified the board that he
would be out .of town for some days and
could not serve as ? an election officer." A
letter was ordered sent to Fontana , in
forming: him; that If <he is in town; on
August 8 next he "will be required to

WITH A THUD
E. Y. ElUs Files Petition
in Bankruptcy as Climax
to a Wild Career in Oil
MAKES <4 PAPER" MILLION
Speculator in Stocks .Gets
Quietus at of* the
Teterans on Pine Street
- Like a rocket, R. V. Ellis ascended the
financial j skies ' of " the ' Occident', and like
a : stick : : - he ; has fallen back -among the
gaping crowd.- Eight years ago, he was a
traveling salesman. 'â¢\u25a0'â¢ To-day he is bank
rupt. V Between 1 - the 'two periods he was
a millionaire. . The ' motive power" in both
the rise and fall of R. >V. ; Ellis was : oil.
Many of those who hitched their wagon
to the star, cut loose at the ; zenith and
now.-',are T - transported 'in automobiles.
Others who became ; dazzled at the suc
cess of the bold operator and joined him
at ' i the height â¢ of ;. . his career saw their
hopes of wealth and their savings vanish
simultaneously when his fortunes turned.
"' Ellis' first-appeared on the financial
horizon in 1597, when he . purchased : son?e
Home roil Company stock for.' next to
nothing.'! # ~r-: ". _
i When â¢ the stock jumped to $5 . a share,
the; men in the downtown districts used
to say, '"There he goes, that's he." Ellis
was Home Oil and Home Oil was Ellis.
He | boomed the \ stock until' every specu
lator west of the Rockies had heard the
echoes.; Then: he tried other ventures.
Every, stock ha touched Increased in value
as If in reality he had inherited the magic
of The gray- whiskered veterans
of many grueling conflicts on .the floor
of the exchange sat at -his feet.
. TIDE TURNS AT LAST.
At one time he"' could have sold his oil
holdings in California alone for an actual
$150,000 in United States gold coin. In the
paper wealth*- of the stock world he was
worth more "than ; a "million. â¢ Ellis felt
his . power and worked feverishly night
and day on one gigantic stock scheme or
another. ,He possessed lands and* oil In
half a dozen! States. He made big strikes
In Colorado and In Wyoming.- ' ;'..- .
; The rocket hung high up while the
bulls and : bears ' of Pine street watched
open-eyed. Then began the descent. The
name "Ellis," which was . spread all over
the oil map of the West, - became blurred.
Whispers were heard here and there that
some of the. incipient Rockefeller's - ven
tures were not . proving successful. His
retinue; grew . smaller and : those who
were requested to "come in on the ground
floor*.' did not smile and hastily accept
as : they would have done a few months
before.:- r ; 7 -."'â¢ '\u25a0 - . - \u25a0 \u25a0' . * â¢'â¢''
Suddenly Home Oil struck the tobog
gan. An employe told a stockholder that
water instead -of oil was being ! pumped
from the wells Into the tanks: Ellis was
Vaway." vNo one knew, exactly where he
could .be. found. -The Investors who want
ed oil in their^ stocks instead of .water
were courteously refused the privilege of
making, an investigation. Down, down,
down fell Home Oil. Those who had
bought in the early days and had held
on sold as rapidly as possible. Those
who purchased at the /* flood saw their
money .turning ashes "before their
very eyes. Home Oil had paid more than
$350,000 . in dividends. ."aiueWEtfisESfq \u25a0>- t vo :
' From $5 the stock \ fell to M arid then
to- J3 ana ; to $2 ' a- share. -When j the quo
tations were $1 65 the stockholders called
a meeting. Of Ellis' original 28,000 shares,
-which he had bought , for 13 ,cents, there
remained ? but : a very small block. . He
had sold secretly .' and left his followers
to; slide Into the abyss. â¢ \u0084
PROSECUTIOIir IS THHEATENED.
."The denunciations of Ellis at the meet
ing of August : 15, â¢ 1903, on the first floor
of the Mills building .' were .earnest and
plainly above , the rattle*
of the -street cars outside. â¢ Several In
vestors told the sad, sad j story of ; their
vanished wealth, after which an investi
gating committee was appointed. When
the inquiry had been \u25a0 completed, R. : 1*
Toplit* and John V. Hinkle sought out
District ; Attorney Byington one day and
asked if the ' law -" did ; not provide some
way by ' which Ellis might be put in a
striped suit in a dungeon-keep across
the bay. It was found that the specu
lator .could not : be brought Jto trial and
the " attempt to \ imprison: him was r aban
doned. -The bulls arid bears went back
to iPine streets determined 'to gore and
crush Ellis at some j future day, when his
stock manipulations ' should bring him
within teactt.^ ;J" ; i :. .. ': Kl^'i'-y
'\u25a0'. The Wyoming and Colorado .properties
petered i outr ' ;The other ventures !of
Ellis \ fell flat, one ; by one. v When Home
Oil hafl dropped to 60 cents," the promoter
was down and out. , In^ yesterday's news
paper Item it was stated that R. .V. Ellis.
Va - miner," had filed a petition \u25a0 In ~ insol
vency 'In the Federal courts the day -. be
tore.' His liabilities were stated to ,be
$17,294 and his ; assets $48,250. Of the lat
ter he prayed that $500 worth of clothing
and - household goods be ]- allowed- him.
Yesterday ? the- -scarred .heroes .of; the
Stock Exchange learned that the ."miner"*
was none , other I than \u25a0 the rocket-like |R.

Mrs. Mary Dlxnmlck of Washington tells

It is with great pleasure we publish
the following letters, as they convinc-
ingly prove the claim we have so many
times made 'in our columns that Mrs.
Pinkham, of Lynn, Mass., is fully quali-
fied to give helpful advice to sick women;
Read Mrs. Dimmick's letters.
Her first letter:
Dear Mrs. Pinkham :â
"I have been a sufferer for the past eight
years with a trouble which first originated
from painful menstruationâ the pains were
excruciating, with inflammation and ulcera-
tion of the womb. .The doctor says inmost
have an operation or I cannot live. Ido not
want to submit to an operation if I can possi-
bly avoid it. Please help me."â ilrs. Mary
I Duumick, Washington, D. C.
; Her second letter ; "'!
Dear Mra. Pinkham :â
. ".You will remember my condition when I
last wrote you, and that the doctor said I
must have an operation or I could not live.
I received your kind letter and followed your
advice very carefully and am now- entirely
well. As my case was so serious it seems a
miracle that lam cured. I know that I owe
not only my health but my life to Lydia E.
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound and to your
advice, j I can walk miles without an ache or
a pain, and I wish every j suffering woman
would read this letter and realize what you
can do for them."â Mrs. Mary Dimmick, 59th
and East Capitol Streets, Washington, D. C.
How easy it was for Mrs. Dimmick to
write to Mrs. Pinkham at Lynn, Mass.,
and how. little it cost herâ a two-cent
- stamp/ Yet how valuable was the reply t
As Mrs. Dimmick saysâ i t saved her liio.
/ Mrs.' Pinkham has on ; file thousands
of \u25a0 just 'such ; letters as the above, and
offers ailing women helpful advice. V

Well, â¢ it's about ,all, over now. . There
was not even a shout left yesterday when
the Comrnuters^got together and put an
other one over. It was not even close at
that, and although the Seals ' did , figure
for a. few innings, /they kissed victory
i good-by and said farewell to first place
; when the .Commuters sent a delegation
of -three; through during a lively mlxup
in the^seventh round.
, It - was all Waldron's . fault. Kvery one
admitted that, for with one safely stowed
away, Jimmy Byrnes lifted a long fly to
center that,. Waldr^n misjudged and the
hit was good 'for two sacks. .Van . Halt
ren came through with a single after
Iberg had. fanned. Then Buck Francks
responded with a drive to right field and
Dunleavy topped it off by taking: a ride
on the-leather for. three sacks. That wad
all/ for It made the score board say five
for the* Oaks and only two for the Seals.
; As .usual, Oakland played the game as
it . had not ' been played around this vil
lage for many moons. The Seals man*
aged^ to bring in' two: more runs before
the game endedâone- in; the eighth and
one in . the ninth, * but the ended
when \u25a0&. double play was pulled off after
Hildebrand had sneaked in with the, last
run. .; ,; \u25a0\u25a0'^ti}V,'^'--^ \u25a0\u25a0 _." \u25a0
I After Goshnauer had been faded in, the
eighth/ Jimmy Whalen cut loose; a single,
but Sp'cncer forced , him at second. Wald
ron clouted to the score board for _ two
bases and chased ' Spencer in. .; But : the
next man could, not make good. In the
ninth, Hildebrand drew a pass and Irwin
shot a hot one second that Kelly
scooped, getting,; Hildebrand at second.
Nealon : clouted for a pair of sacks and
Wilson hit to, Iberg. /.. . :
'Cousin' Parke was laid low at first,: but
.In the. "meantime ;Irwln- tore for the plate
and Nealon for third. The ; Oaklanders
allowed Irwin to register -tJief run while
they were" busily. engaged", iff-'running Nea
lon down." They finally, landed -him;, com
pleting a double play and ending the fray
with : the score 5 to 3 in theif "favor. ,>-,..
5 ; After the ' game seemed in," Kid Mohler
trotted out to second "to" limber up his
stiff wing. It has been months since the
fans beheld the Kid running: around the
grass and they were all glad -.to see him
once again. V.He .did .not", have /a chance at
second, but he chased -Taround just as
lively as of yore and looked fit . to - get
into the game soon. .The score: ._

Jimmy ' Biitt, the premier lightweight
of California and claimant of the world's
title,- will endeavor to add another scalp
to his long; list this evening at \u25a0 Wood
ward's. Pavilion when he meets Kid Sulli
van of "Washington in a twenty-round
bout. It will be a .battle between a great
boxer and a hardened fighter . and will
demonstrate whether skill and science
can : withstand ruggedness and brute
force.
The . men who . make a practice of
wagering on fistic contests . have, installed
Brltt a 2i to 1 favorite; and even
at these odds, the Sullivan money does
not come strong, for - the reason that
many Easterners who \u25a0 are looking for a
chance to .' bet on the "Washington lad
are patiently waiting for the odds to
drop a point or Â» so. and it seems likely
they will. 0 . ...
It.willbe Sullivan's bow to the sport
ing public of: San Francisco. < True, he
was here some months* ago as a sparring
partner of 1 Joe Gans, but he did not ap
pear ." as - a then, though he was
eagerly seeking, a match. But it is since
that time that Sullivan has shown his
worth,: beating the, best men at - his
weight , in the.' East and . crowning his
victorious career by standing the fe
rocious "Battling Nelson off for six rounds
at . Baltimore some . months '< since.
But \ for all .' this, Brltt â¢is as confident
of beating Sullivan as he was of
ping Corbett, Erne, White and the
dozen others he has stowed away within
the .last* two years. The plumber, 'boy
has : prepared himself > for a rough-house
fight " and will - be* ready to ;" meet Sulli-.
van half- way^ should the latter start
rushing tactics \u25a0\u25a0 in the â¢ ring to-night.
Although many have, been led to .be
lieve that Sullivan *,would "be ;an easy
mark 'for the native : son. the wise ones
have awakened â¢*, to; the fact at the last
minute that Sullivan ' is there with an
awful \u25a0 punch and ' any fighter in the
business who can hit hard is always to
be figured, for there ;is ;> no . telling when
he will â¢ whip : one over suddenly, and . end*
the fight without further ceremony/ Sulli
van ; has ' developed . greatly- in \u25a0 his \u25a0 trXin
ing -at San , Rafael ; and in the recent
workouts has shown form that, entitled
him to : a go with . any of them. ':._-.
'.The winner of the. fight will undoubted
ly " be ~ matched - with Battling Nelson
within the next two months. Should
Sullivan be - the - successful candidate.' his
fortune â¢is made; and should > Brltt man
age \u25a0 to * stow -'\u25a0 the ' Washington ,lad , away,
he " will meet the Battling Dane without
further ; ceremony, so ;on this -account,
the fight ".will be an all-Important affair

PORTLAND, July 20.â The Lewis and
Clark swimming and diving champion
ship contests concluded to-day. Again
to-day H. J. Handy, the Chicago Y. M.
C. A. swimmer, proved too much for his
opponents, winning. the mile contest In
2S minutes 21 seconds. ThrÂ«e men-
Handy of Chicago, P. Galley of San
Francisco and J. Mackie of Portland â
started in the race, but Mackie dropped
out at the first 220 yards. Handy fin
ished cleverly, more than 2 minutes
ahead of Galley.
In the diviner event J. Ernest Laid
law, British Vice Consul at Portland,
won over Galley and John Blaze. Lafil
law's distance wai 50 feet.
to the . followers of ring contest*.
Jack "Welch had a talk with both tbm
men yesterday and Instructed them re
garding the Marquis of . Queensberry
rules. The fight will go to the man who
does the most work, though many of thÂ«
wise onea are looking for a knockout
before the bout goes the limit. Beveral
sports .were yesterday willing to wager
that should a knockout be scored. Sulli
van would be â¢ the one to earn it. Most
of the betting, however, has been on
the result, and nearly crery one likea
Brltt at 2 to 1.
The men' will weigh in this evening at
6 o'clock at Harry Corbett's , at 13*
pounds. â¢ This weight Is the natural mark
for both boxers and consequently neither
had much* trouble in making it. Both
were well under the mark last night and
this morning they will each do a llttla
work to limber them up and make surÂ»\
of touching the scales at the required
mark when welghing-ln time rolls
around.'
The advance sale of seats for the fight
has been unusually large, and conse
quently a big crowd i 3 sure to be present
at the ringside. Manager Morris, Levy,
of the Hayes Valley Athletic Club, has
had the bis pavilion thoroughly reno
vated and a large force of policemen will
be Â« on hand to handle the crowd. '
Two good preliminary bouts between
well-known local scrappers are on the
card and some good fighting is looked foÂ«C
when they get together. The mala
event will be. pulled off early, so the *"
crowd will not be kept waiting.HEAVY WEATHER DELAYS COPTIC

starts .for "lsthmus
He and Chief Engineer
Stevens "Will Prepare the
Way for Construction Work
Special "Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, July 20.â ;' There will
never be a repetition of the Wallace af
fair, so . long as pay work goes on. . The
resignation taught us a lesson. Wo have
a I substitute for every official who may
drop out in the future. , In other words,
.we will â¢ have two engineers . and . two
heads of every department, so if one dies
or resigns the other will be able to go
on with the work." . % --J â¢
* This statement was made this afternoon
by, C. P. ' Shonts, president of the Panama
Canal 'Commission, "who started" for the
Isthmus to-day on '\u25a0 the steamship Mexi
cdrJohn F. Stevens, the newly app6ihted
chief engineer jof Panama canal construc
tion, who succeeds ' Wallace, left f/>r
Panama on th=" same ship.
Shonts said that this was his first trip
to . the .. isthmus; and "that his . purpose
was to 1 ldok over the ground with Stevens
and to come back : and^ report to the ad*
vlsory commission at a meeting In Sep
tember. -..'': â¢\u25a0.'â¢â¢
Sbonts said that they were going, down
to get the place read/, preparatory to
building the canal.. If was in answer to
\u25a0 a question as :to what the commission
would do in '.the ] case of Stevens with- |
drawing that \he made the foregoing
statements. He supplemented It -by. say
ing: .... \u25a0: ; : ,, ...; \u25a0â";;.
Itti Wallace took us off our guard. lie
ttught us a very good lesson, but he^dld.not
knowit. His xeslgnatlon wss a bleÃsing. ot
causs we have now prepared for. any even
tuality and the construction, of the canal wm
not suffer a particle. No matter who drops
out ; there will always be another to fill the
. I have heard a great deal about the alleged
red tape that is interiering with lhÂ« con
struction of â¢ the canal, but I haven t.. been
bothered by it. lam not looking for trouble,
but If there be . any red tape I am going, to
cut it, no ma\ter who suffers.- This. will be my
first trip t othe isthmus and -I auppose I have
a lot to learn abput it. but! hope that tne
statements of some allseed flrst-class engineers
that it will take 100 years to .build, the canal
are not true. 1 want to see its tlniÂ«h. â¢':.. \u25a0
â¢Seriously,, I -think it will:. take about ten; cr
twelve years to nnish the canal, if a sea-levÂ«l
one be agreed upon. If a lock canal be de
cided upon the time of construction will de
pend entirely upon ! whether it -Is to bav-e 30
foot or; 50-foot locks, but it should be -cuM-in
flvts years. \u25a0 \u25a0 -
Are you in favor of transfer of â¢ commission
from War to State Department? was aÂ«ked."
i It will make no difference to me. Taft is as
good as Root on Questions of this canal.'*- â¢ '
Is Mr. Stevens â¢a . memDer of the executive
committee of the commission? ; _\u25a0'\u25a0 ,
'No; and he won't be.- ,
What inference is,, to ba taken from this?
The-inicrence that Stevens \u25a0Is to be ; chief,
engineer of the canal and that only.
The Gstt thing -vre- have to do-ls.to get the
underlying conditions down healthy and clean.
ThÂ« French were no fools. They had toclcan
th i. lsthmus and start all" over again with 500
men. . They learned by experience and as a re
sult-of this there was no sickness there until
about the time the United States got in. I pay I
no attention to the complaints of fellows who
have come back from_lhe Isthmus. JHwy are
mostly misfits, torajly.^nnj.., and should not
have gone down "there. * A great many men
were put in -working places, but the men who
stay down there have no cause for complaint

New York Stock Market.
I\'SW* YOUK. July 20. â Etock brokers re
tarded the moderation is thÂ« beat as an lm
j>ortÂ£iit development and to this was attrib
uted in sx> small part the change from the
extreme apathy of the market. The Increase
:a interest proved to be among the sellers,
. s-sd prices suSered accordingly. In addition
* to tie changs la. th* weather there were somÂ«
Cevelopaects of importance In financial af
tairs. First pi&o* was given. In stock market
estimation to th* Union Padflo dividend decla
ration putting that stock on a & per oent
basis aa against U>e recently prevailing 4. per
c*&t rat*. This action was no surpns* and
has bees oosSdcnUy expected for week*. The
' respens*' of the market to the &*ws was
watched, however, with keen attention to form
Â«. judgment of tow far existing prices have
already discounted expected favorable de
velopments. It had been, hoped that a con
siderable influence would remain, with actual
Increases mad* la dividends owing to the
' teetlnicny thus afforded of confidence In the
maintenance of prosperous conditions on th*
; resent railroad authorities. The decline in
; .-.ct-s yesterday on the Illinois Central divi
dend was ascribed to th* fact that th* reru
lar dividend was declared to be still 6 per
oe&L with th* Increase designated as extra
clridftnd. But th* similar reaction In Union
Pacific to-day oa th* rise In the dividend
rs.t* emphasized the Impression that buying
In anUcipatloa of dividend Increases has been
l completed. There was a demonstration again
m- the Hill stocks oa reiterated rumors of an
distribution Â«f assets, which wer* per
a'.etent In epit* c' denial of .them by the head
of those systems. The present markat Is so
largely oa expected disbursement of profits
that this condition Is deemed Important.
Bonds hay* not shar*3 la th* p*cent advano*
r.or have th* preferred etocke, on -which th*
r*turn is restricted to a fixed dividend rate.
The Lor.doa market continued extremely
epath.et.lc la Â«pltÂ« of easy money condition*
fend aftorded no help to this market. Great
Importance was attached to the reports of
- ixviviTig demand in the iron and steel trades.
but this 6eemed to lack enough Influence to
\u25a0 offset th* reactionary tendency from other
tactcrs. Reports of crop damage wer* as
sociated Trtth the strength of th* wheat mar
ket, but an oversold condition In that mar
ket" was Eucpected. Another bank failure In
Kansas City, whil* pronounced unimportant,
wae a minor influence V>ward depression. Al
leged cutting of trunk line passenger rates
and aggressive . measures for freight traffic
tj- the cull HnÂ«s as against the Atlantic
port carriers received same belated attention.
'I he large Increase .in Baltimore and Ohio
c;)erating cost, said to be due to end of tha
year adjustments of accounts, was not help
ful to that stock. Th.* movement for s. leg
islative lnvestibgation of the- Equitable Uf*
awakened come apprehension of the poten
t:a-'ities for barm to thÂ« stock market In that
t.falr. The reepocse of the market to the
Amalgamated Copper dividend Increase late ia
the day lnter.sined th* Impression that divi
dend increases have exhausted their effect.
It. has been predicted that this dividend would
be raised to a 6 per cent rate, but the stock
nold down this morning on allegations that
the rate would be left unchanged. The In
creaeo to a' 5 per cent rate caused a jump
la the etock but It fell back under realizing
ard its final rally did not prevent the heavy
closing of the market.
Bonds were Irregular. Total sales, pat

September option was up %c to lc at 83Vi@
85*4 c. Shcrts ". were urgent bidders' for Sep
tember." Commission houses also 1 were in gen
eral eager to buy. The cause for the press
ing demand was . reported confirmation .of . a
damage to spring wheat by black rust. It had
been previously known that red rust, \u25a0' a . Com
paratively' harmless variety \u25a0of : blight, ' was
prevalent in ths wheat fields of .the Northwest,
but not until to-day, were- there any apparent
foundation for talk of the dreaded black rush.

such affliction of. the growing grain would be
avoided artd had accordingly i/een active on the'
short side tjf \u25a0 the market. Advices . from Mm-(
neapolls and Duluth giving alleged specific de
tails concerning - the * spread \u25a0of black > rust \u25a0 In
thÂ» : wheat fields" of Minnesota. and South Da
kota caused consternation among these . short
sellers and .started j strenuous efforts to cover
sales. In addition, - a report from Liverpool
told of damage to- the -Russian crop. - 'This
increased .the anxiety of shorts. Under these

Decldnoxis and Citrus Fruits.
Trade in fresh fruits was very dull because
of the . continued cool, cloudy weather, and
weak prices ruled for nearly everything on the
list. Receipts of small packages of Peaches
and Apricots showed some decrease, but there
was plenty of old stock available and prices
showed no Improvement. Plums . and : Prunes
were In heavy supply and- ruled weak, the top
quotation for. small boxes and crates being
obtained only for the best -selections cf â¢ Ger
man Prunes. Nearly all of the receipts of
good Bartlctt Pears, which were heavy, were
under contract to the canners. No. 1 stock
was , firm in ; the open ; market Rt the previ
ously quoted rate, while No.' 2 was easy. Sev
eral lots of the latter were sold to outside
canners at $25@35 per ton. The canners werj
also in the market for other fruits, ; paying
$10Â©12 50 per ton for Plums. $25 for Yellow
Freestone Peaches and $4G{150 for Cllngstcnss.
The Apple market was wtak .under he ivy
supplies of ordinary stock .which wai be':v
pressed for "sale... Ht irregular prices.' Grates
arrived freely from various sections and were
slow of sale at easier rates. Cantaloupes dIJ
a little better under decreased receipts, while
Nutmeg Melons and Watermelons stood as
previously quoted. Receipts of Strawbsrrles
were lighter, -but. the. demani being likewise,

A FORGED NOTE
Woman Claiming to Be Wife
of an Oregon Contractor
Imposes on Dr. Vowinckel
EVADES BILL OF $608
Fraud Discovered and the
Police of Eeno Are Asked
to Take Her Into Custody
Dr. F. W. Vowinckei. 903' VÂ»n ; Ness
avenue, who is attached to the 'Cali
fornia Woman's Hospital on Sacra
mento street, says he has been victim
ized by a clever woman and he has
asked the assistance of the police in
arresting: and punishing her. He was
advised to swear out a warrant for her
arrest for passing: a -fictitious note, but
he left the Hall of Justice yesterday
afternoon with his attorney. Johsi Allen,
before a Judge could be found. The
warrant will be sworn to this mora
ine
Dr. Vowinckel says the woman called
upon him last December, representing
that she was Mrs. E. S. Gordon, wife of
a wealthy contractor at North Bend.
Or. She desired to have an operation
performed for appendicitis and the
physician consented. The operation was
successfully performed at the hospital
and the woman Informed Dr. Vowinckel
that a check for the amount of his fees,
$608, would arrive the following morn
ing- The check did not materialize and
she expressed her disappointment. To
allay Dr. Vowinckel's apprehension she
signed on December 27 a promissory
note for the amount, using the name.
"Mrs. E. S. Gordon," the note being
made payable sixty days after date.
When the note matured it was dis
honored, and Dr. Vowinckel communi
cated with Contractor Gordon At North
Bond. He received a reply from Gordon
that the woman was not his wife and
that he did not know her. The physi
cian made Inquiries about his patient
and finally located her In Reno, Nev.
He got a friend to call upon her there
*nd the woman, it Is alleged, admitted
to the friend that she was not Gordon's
wife, but the divorced wife of TV*. A-
MeCord of this city. There Is no such
name as "W. A- MeCord" in the direc
tory. \u25a0 *\
Chief Dinan 'detailed Detective Ryan
on the ca.Â«e and wired to Chief of Police
Leeper of Reno sto arrest the woman
on a felony charge of- passing a ficti
tious bill. - : ~--'
REXO. N'ev., July 20. â The authorities
of this city have- been searching for
Mrs. W. H. McCord, 'the woman who is
wanted in San Francisco for passing a
worthless check there, but so far they
have been unable to locate her.
The heart gains no rest through the
gold cross carried on the oreast.

-Ladies bee His rtountenance at Window
and Decid^ to Quit .Drinking.
His Features Eoom Outside Hens' Nest
arid Occupants Are Terrified.
The can was circulating in the Hens'
Nest. The Hen's Kest Is located in
an old mansion on Rincon Hill.'* The
N'cst* is the \u25a0 gathering place of a society
of old ladles who ' bathe in steam beer.
It was -given th<? title of the Hens' Nest
because whenever, the dear old ladles
get the can filled they cackle. \
They were making a noise like a barn
yard Wednesday night. â¢ The growlers
had been working si^ice sunset and the
old ladies were wound up for all night. .
Just as the clocks ' were striking the
mystic hour of twelve, Mrs. Moore, the
dean of the club, happened to glance at
the window. She saw what purported
to be a face peering Into the room.
It was the sort of face that, you can
see after ten rounds of Sulssesse. It
looked a trifle like a Chinese idol and
brought back memories of Jo-Jo, the dog
faced boy. It was - a face to make any
body believe that the infernal regions are
real. '\u25a0. , .'. "A^'iL
\u0084 Mrs. Moore let out. a yell that echoed
back from Twin PeAks. "Holy Gawd,"
she moaned. "I've got 'em this time for
keeps." \u25a0 â¢ \u25a0 â¢\u25a0'.';.\u25a0 ... /\u25a0 .: . '\u25a0'.
" The otherÂ« looked at the window and
saw the face.
"It's real." they shrieked.
"Gawd, no," walled Mrs. Moore. "It
can't be. I know that. l've got the Jim
mies."
Policemen Tyrell and McNamara heard
the cackling at the Hens' Nest. They
came on the run and located the owner
of the face. It was Yammey McAvoy.
Yammey has Just been released from
an insane asylum. To prove that he was
thoroughly sane again he went home and
walloped his old father. Then he visited
his eld haunts In the southside and picked
up a branigan. . .
The liquor w<;nt to his face. Now,
Yammer's face is bad enough . in repose,
but when he is primed with the oh-be-
Joyfurhls face is a spectacle, a sight, 4
vision, a nightmare and a dream. It was
something that would have to be broken
to you gently.
The face_ and Yammey were dumped
into a . patfol wagon and hurried to the
Hall â¢of Justice. But the memory of
that phrslbgr.on'iy has cast a shadow of
gloom over. the Hens' Nest. .
The motion, to go on. the water wagon
will be taken up; at the next meeting.
Mrs. Moore Is advocating it. strongly. ]
"If steam *beer can cause such : visions
to arise I'll' have to ; be. 'a quitter," she
say's/ \u25a0' '\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 . "' '\u25a0' .'A\ â¢ â¢
After alhasty glance, at that ."mush"

guilty of vagrancy. The face will be sen
tenced to-day, ''.'\u25a0iy^-r^y:- '
Louis Edwards is the patient kid. He
has a' private stock of patience that
would make Job think himself hasty.
Louis waited six hours for a car at Third
and Howard streets. .. : ;
When Policeman Nolan passed . him for
the fourth time he . became ' suspicious.
He went up to Louis and ordered him to
geti into motion. ;
"I'm waiting for a car," replied . Louis.
"Oh," said the policeman ;on i stepping
back, "I thought you were : the'; wooden
Indian for the cigar store' and they'd
forgotten to take you in." V
Policeman Nolan took another long
hike around the beat. -When he got back
Louis was etill waiting.
"You'd better niosey along for a block

CHRISTIANSEN'S
MONEY MISSING
Coin That Was in Pocket of
Saloon Man When He Was
Killed Cannot Be Found
ACCIDENT^ SAY POLICE
Cash and Watch Were Likely
Taken by the Crowd That
Saw Them Lying About
The disappearance of *T5 in gold and a
silver, watch . from the, body of
Christian Christensen, the saloonkeeper
who was . killed } Wednesday night - near
Twenty-fourth and Mission , streets' by |an
inbound ; passenger 'I train, led ; the police
for \u25a0 : a r time ',- yesterday to believe ; ,that
Christiansen- was the victim of foul play.
Their â¢ theory r was that to cover up the
deed, the supposed assailants made it ap
pear'that the saloonman was the' victim
of an accident. After a thorough Investi
gation of the affair by Detectives Taylor, i
Graham and Harrison yesterday and the
.report of the autopsy surgeon who exam
ined ; i the , body, '\u25a0 there was no doubt left
that" Christiansen's death was accidental.
The disappearance of the money and
watch; is, however, a strange feature- of
the case.
.-: Christiansen was killed at 10:40 at night.
He conducted a saloon about fifteen feet
away, from' where the accident occurred.
He left it in charge of Domlnick Mancuso
to 'i. run over to' his home, , which was
about a- block away. The inbound coast
'trainr in"., charge of Engineer -Blgley,
passed this point an instant after Chria
tianseri i had Â« left the saloon. . His body
was found some minutes' afterward, lying
near' 1 the. tracks. ' ; * ' '
An investigation showed that Christian
sen-had been struck by the tender of the
locomotive and dashed against the safety
gate. - - The - gate had been shattered and
blood was . found on it â¢ where the man
had -been thrown against it. \u25a0_'.* a
When Coroner's Deputy Meehan arrived
on the scene he searched the dead man
in the presence of several ; policemen and
citizens.' ' Christiansen's silver watch,
which had- been ; broken from the chain,
was missing. The aum of $915 was found
in his hip pocket There is no doubt
that . Christiansen had had $75, as he
had shown it to five men who were play
ing cards In the saloon a: few. moments
before he was . killed. That the watch
had been torn from the chain and the
money had fallen from his pockets and
been scattered about the street when he
was struck by, the train,, to be picked up
by Uhe ; crowd .that had gathered, or that
robbers had done their work before the
police arrived on- \u25a0 the - scene, are the
theories advanced by the officers.
Autopsy Surgeon Bacigalupl. in the ex
amination'of the body, found that several
of Christiansen's ribs had been broken and
that ' he % had , suffered Internal Injuries.
The deep cut on the right side of .the
saloonmanV Jaw was probably/received
when he was dashed against " the ; safety
gate. \u25a0': . â¢ \u25a0
â¢ Christiansen was a native of ..Germany
and 42 years old. He lived with his .wife
arid four "children at 3258 Twenty-fourth
street"- . . '\u25a0\u25a0', , . â¢ ' . j.- - , '
The, police last night charged Engineer
Bigley with manslaughter. He \ was re
leased on 1 bail."' " :.v ' -^ \u25a0
Christiansen was for. many, years the
partner of Pete Meegan, famous : as a
ball player, in a saloon- at Twenty
fourth and: Capp streets.- Meegan^died
several months ago.'
