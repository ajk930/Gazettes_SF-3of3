I thought of many things, but sug
gested none, while Raffles turned this
much of his statement tnto sufficiently
fluent Italian. But when he faced me
again his face was still flaming. '.
"That beast Corbucci!" said he:
"how can 1 pity him? He took the

flicked me in the face Instead. " ily
idea was that he at least should go
with me â to sell my life a3 dearly as
that â and a sniff would have settled
us both. But no. he must tantalize and
torment me. He thought It brandy; he
must take it downstairs to drink to my
destruction! Can you have any pity
for a hound like that?"
"Let us go." I at last said hoarsely,
as Raffles finished speaking in Italian,
and his second listener stood open
mouthed.
"We will go." said Raffles, "and wÂ»
will chance being seen. If the wor3t
comes to the worst this good chap will
prove that I have been tied up since 1

evidence will decide how long those dogs
have been dead."
But the worst did not come to the

upon the stage. A shuddering intake of
breath sweeps through the house, as the

ous light in flashing eyes, steps to Mr. .
Jasper's side, who, -arising, says, as John,
finishes the letter: f
"Gentlemen of the committee: You are
doubtless- wondering as . to the meaning

importance of this step and when I tell
you on the pledge of a life spent in your
midst that it is of the highest interest
to all. I know you will cheerfully play
the old man's game blind."
The answer was the; instant uplifting
of every hand in the house. In the
deep succeeding hush Mr. Jasper turned
to the bronzed awaiting faces, then in a
voice of most thrilling solemnity said:
"Gentlemen: As the duly authorized

Slejwly and clearly fell the fateful
words. The pencil of the press agent
flew swiftly across his pad. After a
brief pause Mr. Jasper, said: "Now, gen

Slowly â <is rise .thunder clouds â

waves spent into ominous, calm, re
sumed: "The gentlemen behind me rep
resent the crystallized thought of the

verdict rests the terrible responsibility
of launching the coming trouble. It was
my intention â as outlined in the posted,
notice of the meeting â to have a private'

unanimity makes this unnecessary. The

stumbled along the long train, "this Is
a new one on me. My only experience
with private cars has been to shove them
upon cussing, awaiting engineers, but you
don't seem to care."
~""Why~should~ 1?" asked"~John simply!
On entering the car they found a warm
welcome awaiting. The remnants of sup
per having been removed the strangely
assorted party settled down to cigars and
n-i.scr.line comfort.
"Boys." said Mr. Blank. "I am unable
to properly thank, you for the service
you have so faithfully rendered. â¢ It came
in the nick of tune, as had they succeeded

Intelligent aid from each department and
every man. Mr. Lawrence, kindly* hand
me - the package of papers representing
our last night's work."
Lawrence quickly spread a handful of
letters upon the table. From the pile
Mr. Blank selected one. handing It to
Lawrence with the remark. "I'll appoint
you reading clerk."
Lawrence glanced over the familiar
page as though it had first fallen be
neath his eyesâ at the innocent decep
tion Mr. Blank's eyes danced merrily. '
"Mr, Jasper." said Lawrence, slowly.
"Thfs letter is addressed to you: 'Mr.
John Jasper, etc., I hereby tender you
: the position of superintendent of motive
power and machinery at a compensation
of $20,000 per annum. Trusting this
r>ffer will meet with an acceptance, I
remain.* "
\u2666Mr. Jasper broke the surprised silence
by saying: "I'm not fit for that posi
tion. I'm only a rough, old mountain
man and without imagination enough to
ste myself In a white-shirt job. I would,
surely be a beauty!"
"Mr. Jasper, you will kindly remember
that I've never accepted your resigna
tion. Now I need you In this office. No
other man is as well equipped as your
self to restore order from the present
chaos. I, and the Inter-:>rjuntaln need
you. As for the white sflirt partâ our
offices are filled with figure Juggling
tailor models, who will willingly take
jour share fur 550 per month. Your ap
pointment, sir, is effective from this
oate."
The new superintendent of M. P. and
M. settled back into his chair. Without
a glance toward him. Mr. Blank selected
another from the pile. '.
"Mr. Gray." John looked up in sur
prise, "in this letter you are directed to
i* port \to the college of minerals at
Berlin, where arrangements have been
made for a three years' course of study.
Your present rate of pay irffl be sent
you monthly, but all bill 3 will be sent to

"Yes. Gray, I intend to make an In

liver this package and letter. Be very
careful of it. It contains bonds to the
amount of $20,000 and as warm a letter
of appreciation as Lawrence and I
could manufacture. And say. youns
man. If I were in your place I'd take
steps to keep that money in the fam
ily."
The entire party joined In the laugh
afforded by John's blazing face.
-Now. Mr. Jasper." resumed Mr.
Blank, tossing a letter across the table.
"I have a. recommendation to make.
Should it meet with your approval
make the appointment immediate."
While Mr. Jasper was deciphering tho
note. Mr. Blank resumed. "As to the
young man Howe. Mr. Lawrence has a
scheme for his benefit."
Here Mr. Jasper raised his head; a
sly twinkle in his eyes.
â¢Mr. Brady." he said slowly, "Will
you accept the position of general road,
foreman of engineers under me?"
Instead of answering Brady*sat si
lently gazing out Into the night.
They were rushing through a'dip ly
ing at the foot of the live-mile grades.
The pointer of the speejd dial quivered
against "57.. out in the racing shadows

"Mr. Blank." says he decidedly, "I've

horrid Yiddish' oath. , crying. "See" here,

, As Lawrence entered the two vulture
faces twitched. Something in. the tall,
commanding form, erect head and clear,
direct eyes spoke of the victor survey
ing despised, .unworthy antagonists.
"Well, v Mr. Lawrence." sneered Poltz.
"your old-time doves are making a- fine
mess of our property." If we have an
engine, car or roundhouse left by this
time we are playing ialuck."
Then Lawrence spoke.- Leaning
across the table, ho transfixed the Sem
itic orbs with a direct stare, then, with
a laugh, said. "Mr. Poltz. If Mr. Blank
was .so far dead, .to al! considerations
cf public duty as to surrender" â the
even, cutting words, came very* slowly,
but distinctly .nowâ "his control of the
Inter-Mountain into your blood-stained
hands he could make you pay a very
pretty; sum for your whistle."
For a full, thirty seconds the silence
drifted unbroken. Poltz sat. black
eyes open to- their fullest extent, con
templating the smiling. face opposite.
"Whyi man, you are crazy," he finally
blurted out.
Lawrence stepped quickly to the.win

ing intently, to the street noises far be
neath. . ; â¢
"Come here, both of you." he com
manded sharply. The wondering pair
obeyed. â¢ . . '
"Listen to those newsboys," he added
softly.
Up from the bedlam of jargon and
dialect, came the- shriTi cries, "Strike oft
in Inter-Mountain." "Exclusive news
in the Investor." "The Britishers lose
out." "Mr. -Blank regains control," etc.
Lawrence turns to the stricken pair,
saying, grimly: "Mr. Poltz. the next
time you . plan . one of your-, peculiar
campaigns, select a place out of ear

Strange to say. similar thought? were
running through :i!i iieads at mat

maining at Uintah. .The outburst, find
ing nothing on which to wreck its fury,
had subsided 1 into the. inevitable half
ashamed state usually succeeding
epochs where Nature, stand /with her
grim outlines unclothed.
With an instinctive perception of
coming events the men gathered around
the telegraph office. At -9 o'clock the
old chief dispatcher responded to the
imperative call of a "97" message.
'"DENVER. 10-1. '83.
"To all employes: I have this day
severed nyy connection with this system.
The vacated position will be filled by John
Blank. 11. C. COLEMAN."
As no one but Mr. Blank and Law
rence knew the true, cause of the. above
unprecedented wire, it always remained
ti source of mystery. Luckily there was
a small second-story porch to the build
ing. Holding the paper high in his
ha. ids. the tuithful old fellow stepped
out before the awaiting crowd.
'Great news," he cried huskily; "the
old man is back again!"
Amid the uproarious cheering suc
ceeding the reading of the telegram a
man grasped John's arm. saying, point
ing to an ashen-faced old man. stum
bling blindly amid the swaying crowd:
"Better look out for the old fellow;
st-ems to have too heavy a load on."
Yes. a load, even of crushing joy. is at
times heavy to a heart and brain weak
ened in the struggle of the kind which
le.ids to consummation. Joined by Grady
he supported the old man to his room,
where a couple of toddies soon put him
Into a peaceful sleep.
A few /lays later the following was re
ceived; "Silver Canyon: .J. JasperâAr

"JOHN BLANK."
On the evening of- the instanced date
the little party were awaiting the coming
of the train. The wheels had scarcely
ceased turning when, a tall form swung
from the office car on the rear. After a
vigorous handshaking he said. "Mr

nodded vigorously. 1 Returning to the
table Mr. - Jasper in a voice, through
which ran the curiouscatch of a sob,
said: "Engineer Gray will read you a \

The -gentleman thus introduced stepped
forward to stand silently before the
hushed, expectantly awaiting audience. \u0084Â»
"Fellow citizens," he said ' at last,
hoarsely.- "The awful revelation of the

From our bleak Atlantic coast come at
times horrible tales, legends of ' a body

unsuspecting vessels to black ruin.- Can
it be possible that the process of rail

f } commented the eminent finan

| Taking a bundle of addressed
letters he extended them to
the silent clerk waiting, hat in hand,
saying, a ring of triumph in his voice.
"Take these letters to the various papers
to which they are addressed and see that
they fall into the hands of the parties
noted in the left-hand corner."
The main subject of conversation of the
next twenty-four hours was based upon
the uncertain state of affairs on the in
ter-Mountainâa magnificent property be
ing endangered by the lawless acts of a
misguided body of employesâ the lawless
tpirit of the West supporting them, in
trelr assault upon vested capital, etc.
Finally a great newspaper said cditori
"The deplorable conditions existcm
upon the property of the Inter-Mountain
railway form upon a dark background
a flashlight extremely disquieting to the
development of our financial growth. As
is -well known, the majority of the stocn
of this road is held by a body of British
investors. The United Suites is. and will
be for years, dependent upon foreign cap
ital to properly develop her grtat na
tional resources. The gentlemen of the
South British Syndicate are the pioneers
of the long exuected movement, their
purchase of the control of the Inter
\u25a0 ilountain being the initial movement in
a concerted concentration of foreisn cap
ital. In view of these circumstances it
is with a feeling of shamed regret that
xi- e learn that the desperate lawlessness
of the employes is meeting with the ap
proval of the State and its authorities.
F^rom parlies in a position to speak au
thoritatively we learn that the strike, al
though not yet declared, is practically in
evitable, and that behind the ignorant
laborers stand the people and their mis
guided officials.
"In view of this exhibition of sage
bush frenzy we arc imjielled to a?k sol
emnly: 'How long will the Federal Gov
ernment sit supinely, allowing a handful
of .^emi-savases to run amuck through
the vested interests of the nation."
Mr. Poltz read the leader through
carefully, then, tilling out a check in
three figures, raid to the ever-waiting
e!erk: "Take this to the office. Give
|k.'- to Mr. personally, and tell him that
â¢ i am very well pleasenj with his ad."
One erisw morning a few days later
John Gray tucked the following notice
Upon X-hf postoffice door.
"I'nitah. Nov. I.â A mass-meeting of
of those interested in the solution of the
Inter- Mountain Question will be held in
the or>era-hÂ«>u?e Tuesday. November 2.
The meeting will be under the auspices
nf railway employes. After the public
meeting the delegates of the system
will convene in sessiin.
'JOHN JASPER. Chairman."
Underlying strikes as an inflexible rule
p.re but three causes: Wages reduced
1-rvnnd the limit of reason: the non
recognition nf trade or labor associations;
or the goading bitterness of a manage
ment whose blows ha\ - e transcended the
Jtedt of Jirman endurance. Strikes
aif v.ars in which the poor, blinded giant
âLaborâ usually gets worsted. Even rare
\u25a0victory carries amid its laurels seedh
which are as nightshade to his directing
powers. H:s crafty fete? never stand to
lose twice in the sane game. Defeat to
*hem results in the quiet removal
of the victors' most tried clubs, a process
the clubs have learned to anticipate to
their great enlightenment. Strikes con
ducted ever so wisely are deplorable.
When resultant upon the two first above
instanced reasons they are of the things
thoughtful men shun, but when the rank
and file awake to the consciousness that
they are being treated as vermin, and
limb or life no more sacred than that
of the beast driven to the shambles, a
labor trouble broadens into a revolt. Re
volt dips deep into the treasure rooms of
the heart, where men keep a few old
fashioned things â perhaps a withered
band, an agÂ«Â»-lined face, or songs whose
burden is liberty, manhood and God.
Late the night previous Weaver, by ap
pointment, had been given an Interview
Cjv Mr. Coleman. With curtains closely
*avn, lowered lights and stealthy whis
j-.-erR. it had the coloring of a Doge con
ference.
" Well. Weaver." prated Coleman's
husky voice, "how are things working?"
" Only too well," responded Weaver, a
shiver running through his voice. "Not
only every man in your employ â except
the officialsâ is ready to strike, but the
entire population of the State is behind
them. I have been mixed up In these
things all my life, but. Mr. Coteman,
what we have stirred up here terrifies
me. If I might suggest. I would say to
you take the flier to-night, gather up all
of your friends, and, as you value your
life, put miles between you and the men
of this country. "
"What do you mean?" asked Mr. Cole
man. his ruddy face paling. "Hus old
Jasper been injecting his lawless views
broadcast?"
"Mr. Jasper's views are not original."
responded Weaver, grimly. "They are
the reflex of the ideas expressed openly
on every street coiner. Did you read
to-day's Chronicle?"
THE LAST LAUGH
"So, T never look at any of the sage
brush sheets."
"What I supposed," returned Weaver
quietly. "If you had 1 don't think
you would be here. The present man
agement of the Inter-Mountain is open
ly accused of deliberate murder. The
policy pursued is denounced as being
foreign to our Institutions and all citi
zens adjured to crush bath it and its
inceptors. These things are coming up
to-morrow, and I fear Mr. Jasper will
be unable to hold the meeting. If so
and if certain things should leak out
you would need the entire military force
of the Commonwealth to keep their hands
from your throat."
""Thank you. Weaver, ycur advice is
good," said Mr. Coleman after a brief
tilti'ice, adding sternly, 1 "I'll leave to
night. Do not lose your head. As soon
as the htrike is declared send this mes
sage to Mr. Poltz. Shouiu the boys
need anything to increase their zeal,
stand for it at .the saloons," extending
a thick roll of bills, "and above all, re
member we want a strike, not an imi
tation."
Weaver, after skulking from the room
and hotel, rapidly made his way to Mr.
Jasper's house. Entering he found the
conspirators awaiting. Mr. Jasper, an
expectant look upon his face, arose,
saying, "And you succeeded in getting
him to leave town?"
"Yes," returned Weaver. "I put up
a line of talk that worked like a charm.
He starts Kast on No. 4, a thoroughly
scared man."
-Thank the Lord for that," said Mr.
Jasper, piously. "It will avert the stain
cf bloodshed. Had he remained, it
would have tied our hands most effect
ually."
Weaver, a look of intent gravity on
his face, sat staring into the lire.
"Mr. Jasper," he said, as, arising, he
stood facing the little party, "do you
understand the power which we have in
voked?"
"Yes." was the calm answer. "Fully.
The operators in charge of the commer
cial, telegraph understand the conditions,
the entire railway force are Blank men.
John. I'll dictate a messageâ take it in
your cipher: "Peter Lawrence, etc. Strike
declared off. Men understand conditions,
and return to work. John Gray.* \u25a0
"Now. the Consolidated Press have a
representative already on the ground.
A strike will not be declared, but there
will be a change. John. I'll take your
message. Then, for once, when Howe
appears at the office and asks for a red
blank the Consolidated's service will be
interrupted. Lawrence will get it as
soon as electricity can put it into New
York. You can rest assured nothing
will leak over the Inter-Mountain
wires. Weaver, your best course is to
leave here at once. Howe, your work
is this: As soon as the strike is de
clared off hurry to the telegraph office.
When you speak your piece the oper
ator will understand. Gray, guard Miss
Dcane's returned letter as the apple of
your eye. When you read it, take care
to let it soak in." . .
In the morning the combined Town
Hall and opera-house presented an
ominous spectacle. Its widely-flung'
doors seemed the objective point of the
entire excited populace, of the town.
Business places closed and barred,
homes deserted and quiet, spoke pan
toniimically of the trend of public in
terest. Despite" the early .hour, .the
stroke of 9 trembled over aya v dense
mass of packed humanity, which took
in practically the entire population of
the town. Solid business men Jostled
shoulders with faro dealers au-1 "tin
horns." ihe wholesome faces of mothers
ranked against the painted cheeks of
their scarlet sisters. A community of
interests was alive to the throttling of
a menacing monster. Upon the stage.
arranged in a semicircle, were the au
thorized delegates of all terminals upon
the system. Upon their votes rested
the vast of the final die. As the last
strokes yet quivered in the hushed air,
Mr. Jasper, very white and with a curi
ous look of age upon his drawn face,
accompanied by Gray. Brady and Howe,
came upon the stage. Unnotlcing the
surging wave of applause, he passed
gravely to a little table, set upon the
piatforrn's edge to stand awaiting a
chance' to speak. Cheer upon Cheer re
sounded through the great hall, ter
minating in a tiger for "the old boy
who stood by us."
As the uproar sank into silence he
raised a trembling hand, saying In a
low but penetrating voice: "My friends,
this meeting is the result of a. deliberate
policy upon the part of the present
management of the Inter-Mountain
company; a policy that has sent our
best citizens empty-handed as tramps
out into the land of strangers, that has
crushed free speech and thought, that
has indolently flouted the restraining
laws of our State and filled our ceme
teries with the mangled forms of our
dead. Behind the hoarded resentment
of the employes is the stern approval of
the public. The press has made the
grounds of the outraged outburst fa
miliar to all. Sounding through the vi
rile shouts of the quick, threads the
plaintive wail of the untimely dead,
'This iniquity must cease!' " i
The hoarse roar from the audience
was as the crying of a blood-scenting

Neatly every man develops his appetite
beyond his ability. I knew a feller once
thai was always complainin' because
he" hadn't much of an appetite. He was
as: well as anybody, but he was de
prived of the keen and prolonged en
joyment of the table. Finally he got
hold of somÂ« spring water that whetted
his appetite. Then he rejoiced. He
could eat as much as the next man. He
said he had just (it-gun to live. But
pretty soon rheumatism came along
and gave him a twist. Then kidney
trouble hopped on him. He began to
diet and died hungry. I reckon. I see
atsood deal of talk about folks hurtin"
themselves by athletics. The fact is
violent exercise causes them to cat too
much and this is one of the causes of
the evil. Not far from Purdy some fel
ler.s from a city off somewhere cleared
a set of golf links. Old men came to
play. They had spent their lives
humped over their desks. After a
while the old chaps began to drop
dead â just after dinner. They had de
clared that their appetites were better
than for years past. I heard one re-
mark that he could eat as he had when
a boy. As a man begins to grow old
he ought to lessen the amount of his
food. He should eat oftener and not so
much at a time, like a child."
Old Briz sat looking at him. "But
oughtn't a man to eat when nature
tells him to?"
"Yes." Lim answered, "but not as
much as artificial nature demands."
"But how is a man to know?"
'By qulttln* before he feels that he
has got enough. If you stop just a lit
tle hungry you'll find about ten min
utes afterward that you left off at the
right time. Seme of the best things
ever written were penned by men in
prison where they couldn't get much to
eat. When they got out and were
feasted they put aside the Inspired pen
and wrote afterward with a blunt stick.
For the same reason poverty-stricken
authors have, done such bright work.
More brilliant thoughts have come out
of the garret than the palace."
Mr. Hancy took Issue. "Some of thÂ«
brightest remarks have been after din
ner speeches," said he.
The old man shook his head. "They
sound well at the time, when ears are
keyed with wine; but the after dinner
brightness is "generally a story remem
bered â somethin' originated perhaps by
a hungry feller."
"What about the eating of meat?" Mr.
Haney inquired. "Would you advise veg
etarianism?" â¢
"Well, some folks think It's wrong to
deprive -any creature of life, in order to
satisfy our appetites. And for a long
time Benjamin Franklin thought so. too.
But once when he saw some msn dressin'
tish he . observed that the big tish had
swallowed little ones. Then he thought.
'Well, if you eat your kin why shouldn't
I eat you?" And he did. I reckon. its

the creek. v Oxen and sheep were to be

'lowed he was coin* to save himself for
the occasion. Well, the day drawed around
and early in the mornln' I saw old Andy
walkin' toward th* big woods. I asked
him if he had saved himself and he said
he was never as hungry in his life. As
I looked at him I knew he would do
that meat Justice. There was a great
crowd. At the signal there was a rush.
I saw old Andy snatch a hunk of meat

"When I see you again," said â¢ Frost
curtly over his shoulder as he strode

"And when I want you," the girl re

Frost bowed low, so low that the ironic

Miss ' Sterling, standing, white and
shaking, by the veranda" rail," watched
him -go down the path. She j was well
aware that Frost was the sort of \u25a0 man
who lived : up. to .bis word; she. had a
premonition that if he left in this way
it would be- forever. She gripped the
rail and her breath came fast. Some
thing like^ a panic must have seized
her, .for .when he was far down the
path she called,' vsid! Oh, Sid!" but in
such a-. weak voice, which her pride
was striving mightily^ to suppress al
together, that Frost did hot hear it and
kept on his -way without so much as
turning- his head. .
Even when he reached- the street and
was lost to sight behind the high
hedge she still stood ; there by .the rail.
She was angry with Frost for going
away and angry with herself for send
ing him.
She. sank into a wicker chair and
stared helplessly at the lake, which
shimmered in the heat.' There was a
suspicious blur before her eyes. This
would| never . do, she told herself. What
she needed : was action.' She rose with
a view of -seeking the links and play
ing twice around the course. She was
half way ; down the path when she saw
Higgins, the groom, coming up the
drive.
"Higgins," she called, "you may put
the cob in the trap." " ;
"Beg pardon, mum," Higgins de
murred, "but the cob's green and ain't
fit for ladies drlvln'.mura."
Miss Sterling stamped her foot.
"The cob In the trap, Higgins, I said."
Higgins made - his way to the - stable,
mumbling under); his breath, but five
minutes later the trap was at the door.
Miss* Sterling climbed. In .and took the
reins. , Higgins -. let ; go the cob's head,
and -.: by. dint -. of a â¢ wild v scramble man*
aged to ' land in ': the ; trap ; as : the . cod
bolted â¢ for - the" : gate. They ; tore down
the : driveway and swung Into the
street.- Higgins, his dignity by this time
fully, recovered, sat beside Miss Sterling
with folded arms and -Impassive face.
They drove around the lake at a. reck
less !>ace. The girl gave the cob his
head, and the cob made the most of his
opportunity. They bumped -over stones
that lifted the groom a. foot from the
seat, and swung corners : that sent .the
trap onto one wheel. Higgins covertly
watched his young- mistress' face, and
prayed' mentally. . ...
' On the other side of the lake a cool,
wooded road branched from the \u25a0 lake
drive. Miss Sterling swung the cob into
this, . and for- the. first time In his ten
years', service Higgins took the Initiative
in conversation. \u25a0 . r
"Beg pardon, mum, the road's not'
safe, mum. They do be rollin' it with
a road, roller." - \u25a0\i'J' : :f.
Miss Sterling smiled grimly.
"So V much the better," she said. . and
flicked the cob with" the whip. The cob
responded with a jump that bade fair
to dislocate .Higgins' neck,' and the trap
went tearing up the road.'
â¢ Â« â¢
When. Frost left the house he walked
aimlessly around the 'upper end of the.
lake,' reviewing mentally every" word of
the quarrel.' On the far side of the lake
he ..paused before the* little wooded road
that branched off the lake drive; and be
causeV the little wooded Â«road : seemed to
offer the peace and quiet he i sought, â¢' ha,
turned 1 into;, it,, and "walked, .leisurely

he came >upon ' the steam roller ,- bumping
and | scraping over the" broken j stone with
which nthe- roadbed -was;' being repaired.
For lack of -better.- occupation': he parched
on a .neighboring wall, and j watched- the
roller wending its ponderous way back
and forth. \u25a0
He had been there perhaps' an hour
when he heard the whir of rapidly mov
ing wheels. He looked up "to see a well
known trap drawn-. by . a sprightly cob
come smartly around the turn of the
road. , In an instant all was confusion,
for Ihc cob at the sight of the roller stood
erect on his'hind legs. There was a little
feminine shriek and a howl of fear from
Higgins; the laborers on the road yelled
excitedly. \u25a0 ... â¢ â¢ â¢
The- cob came down on all fours
again and plunged madly Into the wall
close to Frost's perch. The trap reel
ed,, crazlly';;.' there was a sound 'of
smashing, spokes. Miss Sterling was
tossed from the driving seat into a
clump" of ' bushes, and Hlgglns sailed
over: the wall like some- ungainly fowl.
The cob -kicked himself clear, of the
wreck and galloped snorting up the
road. .
Frost ran to the girl and' lifted her
from the bushes.' To his unutterable
joy and astonishment she was 'unhurt.
All at once he fell to laughing; happily.
"See ' here, , you've come to me â
you've groveled' at .my feet,", he. cried.
At -that moment \u25a0 Higgins crawled
painfully over the fence, his hat gone
and his tousled hair bristling; with bur
dock burrs.. . .-. .
. "He ain.'t no ladles* horse, mum," he
began .in deprecation* : â¢ â¢
\u25a0 Miss .Sterling, supported by Frost's

THE Hon. Bill Dick Bugs, candi
date for the legislature,, gave a
dinner to the leaders of the men
â¢who were undoubtedly going to
elect himâ they said. Having had
no experience in politics Mr. Bugg was
thought to be an honest man. They gave
to him the title of '"Honorable," for the
sufficient reason that once when the
president of the State Fair Association
gave a talk in the vallage church. Mr.
Bugg introduced the speaker with a few
most happily chosen remarks. This was
the beginning of his candidacy for the
Legislature.. The idea for a dinner came,
he said, in the nature of an Inspiration.
lln was walking about in his woods
pasture, not thinking about anything' in
particular, .when as suddenly as the well
worn fightnirisr out of that old and fa
miliar clear sky, the Idea flashed upon
him that It would be well to give a din
ner. He did not halt to debate with this
inspirational suggestion. Such flashes,
proving a higher state of existence either
heretofore or hereafter, are not to be
plied with prosaic questions. So, Bugg
struck a trot for the house. Into the
kitchen where his wife was patching a
milk strainer with a piece of thin cloth
he burst, even as suddenly as the In
spired idea had broken in upon his own
mind. "Kate." he said, "we are going to
give a dinner."
She was a woman of strength. She
had met many an unexpected shock, but
now 6he dropped the strainer and ex
claimed: "For the land sake."
Well, the dinner was given and there
were present more than one notable of
the neighborhood. Shang W. Mowlett,
editor of the country paper, drove out
from the village of Purdy. The Rev.
Mr. Hancy, recalled to the circuit after
an absence of one year, was early upon
the scene. "The good wife" of the can
didate hoped that the brother had
brought Ills appetite with him, and whÂ«n
opportunity offered the brother proved
to her that he had. The table was set
beneath a mulberry tree. Upon the
white cloth the shadows of the wavering
leaves wove fantastic shadows, or at
least such was the observations of Mijss
Paulina S. Beck, teacher of the neighbor
hood school. Bhe murmured this con
ceit to the Rev. Mr. Haney and with fit
ting seriousness he cleared his throat and
said that in his opinion she had un
doubtedly struck upon a poetic if not a
profound truth. Present among them
was a baked shote, known as a peach
orchard barrow, lean, active and pos
sessed of much juice. He had been brown
ed to a mouth-watering crisp. Along to
ward the fag end of the feast the candi
date talked eloquently of his prospects;
and having been assured of his election,
Intimated that conversation on other top
ics might not be out of order. "Mr.
Jucklin," eaid he, "what do you think
of eating In general?"
"Overdone more than almost any
other necessary thing," the old man
answered. "Nature . has given man a
good deal of judgment . and has en
dowed the brute creation with instinct,
but neither Judgment nor Instinct al
ways^Â«erve to keep man and beast from
gorgin' themselves with food."
"Ah. you would seem to make glut
tony as much of an evil as drink,"
spoke up Mr.. Haney.
_ "Yes, a more universal cvil â physic
ally. Eatln' is a more Individual evil.
It Is true; but It Is a great evil just
the same. A man that eats too much
dulls his brain and renders his body
inactive."'
"But does not abuse his family," said
Mr. Haney. The school ma'am smiled.
"Well, it might not seem so,, but Is It
a' fact? Too much food makes a man
ill-natured. Digestion is the seat of
good-humor. An overloaded stomach
doesn't Inspire cheerful words.- The

JOTTINGS OF OLD LIM JUCKLIN
ON EATING
OPIE READhave pleased me most, and for 1 which I
can Imagine skipping all the other courses,
âthat is - the 'alligator pears. I do_ not
hesitate to confess my weakness for .this'
delicate vegetable (or is it a fruit?) and
fancy that I could easily have passed the
raw' flsh, the bread fruit and the pig
and have devoted myself to the alliga
tor pears. And by the way| the alligator
pears are really ejulte an Important Item
In the exports from Tahiti now, besides
the oranges and vanilla, etc.
Mrs. R. also told me about t the colfee
of the island/which it seems is not enu
merated among the exports, but which
grows in all the gardens there. The peo
ple go into their gardens and pick the
coffee berries, which are of course pre
pared in the same way. that all coftee
berries are treated. But Mrs. K. found
it to be a most delicious coffee. She hud
not heard of any large plantations of
coffee, but only of the small supply th.v
the people get from th*eir own gardens.
She spoke, too, of the beautiful scenery
of the islandâ the mountains, the valley
and' the seaâ all in so small a space as
to form a glorious effect. Of the people
she saw, of course, but little â her time
there was too short. But she was im
pressed with their gentle natures and
their soft voices, and their evident de
sire to please and to be of service. She
told me that she was very sorry to have
so short a visit, but to stay longer sha
would have had to await the Mariposa
on her next trip, a stay of thirty days,
and that was too long. She would- gladly
have prolonged her visit ten days more,
but she was compelled to embark and
start' for San Francisco on the Mariposa
on her return trip. -
Sailor suits are almost always pretty
and becoming, and just the thins to wear
on an ocean steamer running through' the
tropics.
One of the illustrations shows a sailor
suit that is in very good style. It Is
exacUy like the suit of a debutante of
last year, who this year made the trip
to Tahiti. It is of duck and ao made
as to draw over the head like a sweater,
and it can be worn either with or with
out the little vest. The skirt is quite
short, which is not only proper but nec
< ssary on board a steamer. The sailor
hat worn with this suit is very . pretty,
It goes without saying that all the
costumes that I have tried to describe
can be worn on any trip to the tropics,
but it Is of Tahiti that I am thinking
all the time. People go to the Hawaiian
.Islands or to Panama "or Central America
for business or to visit friends, but when
they get aboard the Mariposa bound for
Tahiti it almost always means simply %â¢.
trip for rest and recreation. The long,
sea voyage is salutary, the rest Is delight
ful, and stay at the "island is Just
long enough to enjoy the beautiful scenery
there and to create an interest in the
simple and gentle people that live there.'
The descendants of the old royal family
âthe Tcva familyâ still exist 'there, and
Another,; Illustration shows a . particu
larly \u25a0 pretty -linen suit that I saw at"
Davis' the other day. So pretty that I
had it 1 photographed on that account. It
was'a lovely 'shade of blue, made with a
very long coat, which buttoned straight
down the -front with white bone buttons.
Its only ornamentation was that the col
lar and cuffs were made of blue panne
velvet. This combination was striking
and effective, though It may seem an
odd one. ' . Â»,.
The coolest parasols, .or rather those
that have the 'coolest appearance, are
made of white, taffeta. \Vhito is said to
be the best color 'for absorbing the heat
rays of the ; sun?" The : , helme t hats of
Indian or African English travelers are
always white, though some' of them are
adorned with a : loose green band around
the^base.
A parasol of pale mignonette green
moire, .trimmed with frills of. narrow
lace on the border and on top, is very
dainty and attractive. It is something
new to see a painted parasol, but there
are a good many of them this summer.
I saw a short time ago a very pretty one
made of white taffeta, with a hand paint
ed trailing design, of water lilies, and
their long green stems. The handle was
white enamel.
A dress that can be worn both on the
steamer and on shore at the island 13
a white^plque. linen or duck skirt, with
a shirtwaist of cool lawn, especially when
a lingerie hat and parasol are added.
It Is a costume dressy enough for after
noon tea. Afternoon tea* at Tahiti, by
the way, is not, exactly the same thing
as that function in San Francisco. In
Tahiti it is served on the broad, shady
veranda, anil unink cocl with. plenty
oflc-mon and without milk; arid very re
freshing it is.
The lingerie hat. is the beat to wear in
ana ueiiuunng. . > . \u25a0 , : -.-... \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0
Gloves are, .of course, but of the ques
tion, but lignt.mitts\can be worn to pre
vent the hands from being browned "to
a turn." In Paris, mitts- have' been 'all
the style this year, and there are- many
different^ styles in lace nard net. The
handsomest of them are netted by hand
of fine twist,, and there are both black
and white real duchess and point" lace
mitts, and there are also "openwork silk
mitts in colors' to match j^my gown.
A particularly necessary adjunct in the
tropics Is a parasol, more. especially now
that hats are being .: reduced to such
small proportions, and in this line the
choice is bewildering.. There is the smart
coaching parasol .with the club handle,
or the dainty lingerie parasol, that goe3
so well and looks so attractive with the
lingerie hat.
while one's dress raust^ be very light and
cool and simple, still it may' be pretty
ecru lace, though I confess " to â¢ a prefer
ence for the embroidered linen ones.
Underclothes have to be considered, and
they must.be of, the thinnest possible ma
terial. Flannel is hardly, to be thought
of, but the lightweight linen mesh may
prove to be a good substitute for It, with
a- fine light , chemise over it.
A very nice material for a gown In the
tropics is net. It is coolerthan organdie,
even, and ijr more dressy. One of the il
lustrations shows a very pretty white
net gown. It is lined, with silk- of the
softest variety, and prettily made with
insertion and shlrrings. The net worn
this year Is so soft .that it is very at
tractive. t Of course, these net gowns are
hardly, appropriate \u25a0 for \u25a0 steamer wear,", but
they are just the thing after the steamer,
reaches Tahiti, and, -the > passengers : are
on shore. _
It must be understood that it is not all
"Mother^ Hubbard""-: gowns. In ; Tahiti.
There Is quite a little society there, and
and serves a good purpose as a sunshade,
but wl'en tho ovoan breezes Mow, then
this hat must bo securely, "lashed" â¢ to'
some part of the wearer's "rigging."
Caps are much preferable to hats on
board a steamer, and much more com-*
fortable. but they seem to have gone
out of fashion entirely.
Even this sailor- suit of duck will be
found to be too warm a3 the steamer gets
into the tropical zone, and Is about to
"cross' the line. 1 " Some thinner material
must be substituted for Itâ something that
Is more gauzy, that the air can pene
trate, and for- this purpose organdie "is
perhaps as cool " as anything, and cer- '
tainly as pretty. Some 'very pretty
women can â¢be seen on a Tahitian
steamer, prettily and becomingly dressed
in organdies, dimities or mulls, which
makes the deck look very gay and. at
tractive. . This Is a very different appear
ance from .a bleak Atlantic liner, whose
passengers are bundled up" in coats and
steamer rugs, and sit round on deck
looking cold and cheerless. \u25a0;. .
One of the illustrations shows a very.,
pretty organdie dress, made with a great
deal of lace and Insertion. 'The skirt is
particularly effective, made with tucks
and large wheels of Insertion. The wheel
pattern seems to" be a very popular de
sign this year, and in this gown there are
some large wheels inlaid in groups of
tucks.
IT is something new and interesting to
take the sea voyage of thirty days
or so to Tahiti, and to sail through
tropical airs, balmy, soft and warm,
tempered by the ocean breezes. And
It is new and interesting to see the cus
toms of a lazy, tropical race, to whom
fashions are not only unknown but un
thought of- The one garment worn by
the native women Is merely a Mother
Hubbard, loose and free, and utterly de
void of style or grace.
What is it to them that sleeves are
worn large at the top, down to the el
bow, with a tight ruff from elbow to
wrist? The meaning of a lingerie petti
coat with a detachable flounce is as ob-
Bcure to their unsophisticated minds as
wa.s "Baralipton" to Charles Lamb.
They would scorn the confinement and
imprisonment of a corset at any price,
end one can fancy their terrified in
credulity at a corset costing the sum of
$260 â almost a Prince's ransom.
They little know that when excursion
ists start from this port for their tiny
kingdom the subject. of clothes is care
fully considered, and large trunks are
packed with all kinds and degrees of gar
ments to be worn first on board the
6teazner and then on land.
The single steamer bound for Tahiti is
the Mariposa, and it is "described to me
*s being a very comfortable and pleas
ant steamer to make a sort of home on
for about four weeks, for the round trip
Is usually about thirty days. Now thirty
days of traveling, and traveling in tropi
cal weather, with no laundry facilities to
be had, means a whole lot of clothes in
pretty large trunks. We must start out.
too. with warm wraps, underclothing,
coats and rugs, which are shed gradually,
one by one. and' the lighter garments sub
stituted for them.
Leaving here in June and encountering
the cold and foggy air and the rough
winds of our coast, my friend was well
wrapped up in her coat, and' kept her
steamer rug well around her when she
eat on the deck. On the third day. out
the coat and steamer rug were discarded,
on the fourth day a lighter drees was
tried, and on the fifth day a costume
for tropical wear was finally and perma
o^nUy assumed.
Perhaps it Is not always smooth sail
ing on tropical seas, and possibly my
friend was particularly favored, but she
describes the voyage as pure delight. -
Calm, peaceful and tranquil, the waves
were scarcely rude enough to rock her to
Bleep, and the moonlight nights on the
ocean were warm and delightful. Her de
scription has fired me. with a desire to go.
It seemed so different from my experi
ence in crossing the Atlantic, where we
were pitched and rolled about by angry
She told me that one of her fellow-pas
sengers was a -native Princess, who. as
soon as the ' steamer came into the
tropics, immediately put on her' Mother
Hubbard gov.-n, which she wore with all
the grace possible to that primitive gar
ment. The Princess was gracious and
communicative, and it pleased her to an
swe-r questions about the people of Ta
hiti and their customs. She ' bemoaned
tho contact cf European civilization,
which she thought was answerable for
the degeneration and shrinking of her
peopleâ and she delighted to tell of their
simple and kindly natures.
/ And so the voyage passed, a delightful
trip and a health-giving rest, and the isl
and was reached at last.
My friend, Mrs. R., was of course for
tified with Jettcrs of introduction, but her
stay there was very short, and she was
mostly with the Goupils, who were most
hospitable and kind. This, family is by
far the most important one at the Island.
They gave Mrs. R. a native dinner,
which she seems to have enjoyed im
mensely.. The menu will no doubt sound
peculiar, and perhaps not altogether ap
petizing.
Beginning with soup of some singular
kind, the meat course was called by the
familiar name of oysters, but turned out
to be. raw fish with a dressing of lemon
Juiceâ "perfectly delicious," said Mrs.
R. (only excuse me. If you please, from
eating ray flsh uncooked)â then prawns,
something like miniature lobsters or mag
nified shrimps (the* description was not
very clear), baked bread fruit, fried
plantains and roast pig. The pig, she
was careful to explain, was home raised,
clean, and of unexceptional character.
But I forgot the one item which would
All this Ts so very, very different from
my, friend's description of her voyajo
to Tahiti that, as 1 said before. I am
wild to go there, and shall certainly try
to accomplish It.
Her dre-sses, she told me, were all of
thin lawn and dimity, after she
reached the daj\ of change, that is,
the fifth day out. How many such
ligÂ£t and cool garments she had I do
not remember, but she. must, have
had a great many, for the stay at
Tahiti was only about vfour days, surely
not long enough to wash and iron many
of her beautiful robes and underclothes
and lingerie, and soft and fluffy mus
lins.
seas, where sleep was difficult and spas
modic, and where seasickness made life
seem not worth living. There, when we
ventured on deck, we found some pallid
sufferers like ourselves wrapped up to
their eyes in rugs and cloaks, clinging
to their chairs and looking as if the
"crown of martyrdom" could not* com
pensate them for their misery.
Then, too, there are always a few ex
tremely obnoxious ones who parade in an
offensive manner their freedom from sta
slcknces. odious men who delight to
smoke their cigars in the face and eyes
of Â«.i.e suffering crowd, arid whose eman
cipation from all the trials and hardships
of the- voyage only emphasize the general
dejection of the others.
gowns, and the roses in the path. Tha
only drawback to the hero business aa
he saw It was that it was likely to re
sult in the death of the gentleman
working at it. In the majority of cases
that seem to be considered the only,
proper way to wind up such a career.
a*iid Lysander didn't exactly hanker to
be dead, at least not at once. Funeral
eulogies, weeping multitudes and crack
ing obituaries are all very well in an
impersonal sort of way and wouldn't
be half bad if a man could hang around
on the outside and take it all la. but
they're likely to be wasted on the chap
in the casket.
-Now it chanced that Lysander had a
brother who had rejoiced in the useful
cognomen of Henry, usually marked
down to Hank. Hank had never been
noted for his ambition, although there
was a time when he bad burned to be
the best baseball pitcher in town and
-to turn a double somersault oft a
springboard Into deep water. It should
be noted that he achieved both of these
noticeable distinctions before he gave
up trying. As Henry grew older he
came slowly to the conclusion that one
of the most important operations of life
is to hold up one. end of the log with
out worrying very much about the ul
timate destination of the load. Ho
wouldn't have objected to being presi
dent or even to pulling off something;
good in the hero line, but he didn't lie
awake nights wondering what he .
should do if he should suddenly come/
to and find himself one of those things.
Instead he gave himself wholly and un
reservedly to his appointed task of de
livering groceries and watching out for
a few good things coming his way. If
greatness should happen to come alone
and tag him while he was attending to
business It would not be likely to find
him too bashful to fall In behind the
brass band, but he thought that he had
better wait until he heard the music
before he lined up on the curb.
The years passed as they have bad
the habit of doing ever since we can
remember distinctly and found Lysan
der and Hank doing business at the
same old stand and in the same old way.
The former was still hanging around
with one eye on the future and the
other on the cracker barrel in his
brother's wholesale grocery. He hasn't
done anything particularly great or
heroic, but all he lacks la the chance.
In the meantime he does his brother
the honor of boarding on him most of
the time and telling him how to run
his business and what should be dona
to reform the world. Hank says noth
ing and sells groceries, His son holds
down the principal chair in ' the offlce
of . counsel for the International Rail
road Syndicate. Limited â very limited â
and his daughter has cornered one of
the oldest and most impecunious titles
in Debrctt's list. He has three col
leges and a home for disabled grocery
men to his credit and the trea3urerof
the national committee puts hla name
at the head of the list when he begins
his rounds campaign year. ' Thu3 we
can see with one eye tied behind us
that Hank is qualified to be ranked as
one of the solid citizens of the com
munity, while Lysander Is still one of
the most ambitious â and useless.
The lesson that care and delibera
tion can extract from this brief but
touching double-barreled biography la
that the man who hitches his wagon to
a. star, should first make sure that he
has enough power turned on to carry
him up the .steep grades.

of the boy world in Fruitvale. Jim Crow
hurst Is an amateur pugilist. Jim Crow
hurst has fought twenty-mree- prelimi

is an authority on sporting lifeâ and on
the devious ways of life. Jim Crowhurst
Is nineteen and sophisticated. Jim Crow
hurst condescends to notice the small boy
of Fruitvale. even to hobnob with himâ
for a consideration, no doubt, in the way
of cigarettes or beers or small change.
Jim Crowhurst has a history of wicked
ness and adventure that would make even
a Nickel Library hero look pale when
you hear Jim Crowhurst tell it on the
street corner at night to the congregated
gang. From the police point of view it
is pitifully tawdry and contemptibleâ but
the small boy. and "de gang" do not. of
course, take the police point of view.
Ji;n Crowhurst. with his shuffling, soft
footed, apologetic gait and his sharp,
ferret face : and his shifty blue eyes set
much too close together, comes in to see
me and looks at me around the end of his
nose first with one eye and then with the
other.

talking with her in the hall one day â
that was all. Just talking in the hall â
and two weeks after I was sent to tho
principal and expelled. I don't know
why â unless it was for talking to this
girl, and she was expelled, too."
Jim Crowhurst has been "pinched,"
too, "just once," he hazards.
I laugh incredulously, for I know
better and Jim Ciowhurst knows I
know.
He laughs, too, not mirthfully, for
this sort of boy has no mirth.

speaks in his favor, and the only one well

air of. manliness and self-reliance that
makes him appear older. He alone of
the four can look you squarely in the
eye. But he, too. has been "pinched,"
he admits reluctantly, resentfully and
shamefacedly. He, at least, doesn't seem
very proud of the distinction, and he
holds to it that it was only because he
was out late In violation of the 9
o'clock ordinance. There is a courage in
his face that might easily swing the
wrong way and become bravado or reck
lessness, and he says with some bitter
ness that he has been living at home "on
my folks" for some months' because he
has been on the waiting list of the S- P.

Iniquities of boyhood, usually to the in

average manhood.
For the dangers of this transition state

there are many remedies offered.

It Is their youth and their hard, un

There Is- perhaps nothing very startling
In the story. Hold-ups are commonplace
crimes, happening with unpleasant fre
quency, yet with such frequency that
they lack the zest of novelty. "~
It is the youth of the suspects, of these
boys sitting smoking cigarettes in the
ceils of the Oakland Jail, that makes it
appalling.
But out of the homes of Fruitvale the
boys were taken by the arm of the law,
and clapped into jail.
At about - o'clock in the morning, be
fore they could get home, they were ar
rested by the Sheriff, and the first thing
one of the boys did on arriving at the
jail was to hide a. leftover $10 gold piecÂ»
in the mattress, after yielding up in the
usual legalized search ?2 or $3 in sliver.
For days the victim of the hold-up lin
gered unconscious between life and death,
and at the first glimmering of conscious
ness was examined.
"How many had assaulted him?"
He was too weak to frame an answer,
but raised three f*eble fingers to show.
"Who were they?"
He couldn't speak their names, he had
not the strength.
Did he know th^m?
"Yes," he signed.
Was it this one? That one? Another?
Names beginning wifti "S" were re
peated to him one after the other, and
he made no sign until the name of John
Schneider, the first of the suspects, was
spoken.
"Yes." he signified, and each time it
was repeated he signed ..hat that was
the name he meant.
Then names beginning with "B" were
repeated to him â "Brown, Berry, Blan
chard. Black," and no sign; "Blaker?"
and he assented. "George Blaiter?'*
"YeÂ«=, yes." he signified.
But there were threeâ and they had
beaten Thomas Cook most terribly, and
left him for dead. He was too weak to
stand the strain of longer questioning.
The throbbing pulse was increasing
warnlngly, and he could, be questioned
no more.
On Sunday, the day following the hold
up, while all Fruitvale was aghast at the
ruthless brutality of it, and was exchang
ing opinions about it on the street cor
ners, and front steps and over the back
fences, these boys came over to San
Francisco dressed in their best and bent
on having an hilarious good time. They
went to the ChuUs and rode on and in
everything ridable, saw everything that
is "extra" as well as everything free, fed
peanuts to the monkeys and ice cream to
themselves, had dinner at a restaurant,
all the cigarettes they could smoke and
beer they could drink, went to the Or
pheum at night, and started home on the
last boat, each having spent the greater
part of $10 in the purchase of hilarity.
other friend.
Among them, on the very day of the
hold-up, they couldn't raise 10 cents for
tobacco.
THERE are four boys cooling their
heels in the Oakland jail, each in a
cell by himself, cut off from com
munication with the others anÂ«l
the outside world, spending the lon^
â¢waking: hours in meditation and cigar
ette smoking.
The oldest is less than twenty years,
and the youngest is only 15.
They are held as the suspected perpe
trators of an unusually brutal and sin
gularly atrocious crimeâ a hold-up that
. may develop into a murder.
At about half past 9 on the night of
Saturday, July 22, just two weeks ago,
Thomas Cook, a young grocer of Fruit
vale, scarcely more than a boy himself,
staggered into the yard of a Fruitvale
resident moaning for help and sank to
the cround.
He was picked up unconscious, cruelly
beaten, with his skull terribly fractured
In the back, so crushed that over three
Inches of bone have had to be removed
6lnce then; with the scalp on the top of
his head lacerated and bruised by violent
blows, w'th one eye gouged out and with
his pockets rifled.
His whole appearance told the story
of savage and unrestrained violence, and
the quiet, peaceful, rural Fruitvale com
munity shuddered at the discovery that
guch a thing could happen in its midst.
Who could have done it?
What alien, evil wanderer of the night
bad turned his steps this way?
At the very thought they drew to
gether more closely, they gathered their
families about them more protectingly.
And Sheriff Baraet of Alameda County
eet about reconstructing the crime from
such fragmentary evidence as he could
find.
Robbery, of course, was the motive; the
rified pockets and the fact that young
Cook was known to carry home from the
grocery the money taken In there
established that easily enough. On the
eight of the hold-up he was carrying
home $230, and not a dollar of it was
found on him when he was picked up.
Traces of a struggle and the exceeding
violence of the assault indicated that
young Cook had resisted, and perhaps
recognized his assailants, who. In their
desperation, determined on making a fin
ithed job of it. on the ancient supposition
that dead men tell no tales.
Then
A boy's cap was found on the scene of
the crime.
A woman remembered she had seen a
bey running away from the spot in con
, fusion and alarmâ and Â£he thought she
knew the boy.
A piece of one-inch lead pipe, of a
handy Kngth for clubbing, was found
wrapped in canvasâ and there were blood
stains on the canvas.
Another weapon of the same home
made effectiveness ar.d bearing the same
marks of usage was found.
And suspiciously near the abandoned
weapons was Jiving a boy who had es
tablished his reputation for waywardness,
who already, at the age of sixteen, was a
jailb'rd and a jailbreaker.
This boy and his funning mate had

delivery wagon with him. had been treat

this stage of his progress, the back
swim should be taught. The pupil is
stretched out as for the float, only arms
are extended to side, with hands under
the hips and palms flat. Then turning
the hands half sideways they should be
moved outward about a foot and re
versed and brought back. The move
ment is exactly that of sculling a boat.
Instead of the oar blade being held
oblique and reversed It Is the hands.
Having taught the back float and swim
it is necessary to teach the pupil to coma
to the breast swim from the back. Tha
method of turning over Is shown in figure

downward through the water, while the
If any of you other dubs haven't gone
on your summer vacation and are going
to a place where there is water, and
can't swim, listen: that's what I did, too.
I could make a bluff before an unsophis
ticated darnosel at rowing a boat, riding
a horse well broken to the walk, and
tripping a number nine fantastically.
But when the adorable daughter of
wealth whom I was endeavoring to land
to replenish my defunct exchequer got
into a bathing suit, and the chap I had
bumped in the matter of 4he chargers
began to swim flgrure eights all arouud the
adorable figure, tickle her under the chin
on the bald pretext that he had to do it
to keep her afloat, and finally lug her
out to the raft and sit all cuddly and
carefree, and twinkle his toes with hers,
well, I loaded up on stogies and a flask
and hied me up to the summit of a moun
tain, far, far from the twinkling toeses,
and sat down hard.
No, take it from meâ you're not in
it if you don't swim. You may play
tennis and polo, ride like a Comanche
or, pull a bo^t with a thirty-eight
stroke, but when they take tho after
noon swim, it's you to. the chemise
brush to wait till the agony is over.
You might kinder loaf around the bath
house, but you will find the strain of
trying to look as though you enjoyed it
a little wearing.
It's peculiar, too. In a way, the man
ner in which girls take to the water
above all things, and, the infinitesimal
percentage of girls who can swim, de
spite the fact that they go through the
same chin tickling and toe twinkling
relaxation year after year. Sometimes,
away down in the basement of my
sub-consciousness I think that that's
about all they go in the water for, any
how; that and the vouchsafed privilege
of the bathing suit of displaying a lit
tle greater length of hosiery than the
amenities of conventional garb allow.
If a woman doesn't adorn a bathing
suit, she thinks she does; and if she
does, then you can gamble she knows
she docs. In both cases they are satis
fied, and so the tickling and twinkling
go happily on.
Having rid my system of these few
remarks on. the side, wo will return to
where I was sitting upon the moun
tain top, tip top, with my consolation.
Sitting there In the solitude of that top,
with the sylvan glades arid other poetical
things. I framed a mighty resolution.
When I got back to town I would swim. I
shook hands on it and the tumble bugs
bore witness. So that's how when I
got back from my vacation I nosed
around to find a, competent, swimming
teacher. That's how I found J)an Car
\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 y \u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0.-â¢-,
Many of us grow tired at times of the
irksome grooves of conventionality.
But lo! here we have it. Go shed your
duds, get into a bathing suit, and en
joy the free and easy ethics of the
water. If you have been trying to flirt
with a girl on your block for a year
and haven't made the riffle, why see if
she can swim; find out the baths she
attends; get into your suit, happen to
bump up against her, eplash a little
water on her accidentally, and dear me,
you're the best of friends In a jiffy, it
really puzzles me, this thing of wom
an's conduct in the water. If you're
a better swimmer than she is, she
straightaway wants to learn; if she's
a better swimmer than you, a man.
Lord love you, the tank can't hold
her. In the first place she huroble3
herself to you; in the second, elevates
herself above you; and in both is
graciously flirtatious.
I would really like to know whether
woman dressed in the conventional
way. dancing, playing the piano, riding
or driving, is the real woman; or whe
ther this other likable creature who
disports mefmaldenly and kicks her
twinklers all over the place, is the
woman. I rather suspect the latter.
Not that there is anything wrong! Oh
dear no ! But a sort of a-er-playful lit
tle fit seems to come over them, which
is most enjoyable. I guess the whole
proposition is a question of getting a
little closer to first principles; a little
away from the straltjacket of conven
tionality.
late tens or early twenties who is the
chief graft for the resorts, and who can't
swim.
There may have been a thousand rea
sons why you can't swim. Maybe, like
me. feeling that you were no Phoebus
Apollo, you were somewhat timid of dis
playing the length and the thinness o{
your shadow in all its paucity. Maybe
you feel that you were blessed by a
bountiful Creator with a neck that should
have been bestowed down in the African
Jur.gle to a three-knot giraffe. Maybe you
have got a pair of legs on you that the
kiÂ£s used to call you "Beany" for; or
"Gawky" or "Ladders." I have enjoyed
all of those gentle shafts from the ready
njouths and quick tongues of ingenuous
little street garriins. Or maybe you had
the vague Idea which I had, that the
thing would take up months of time, and
letting the years slip by you never found
the time.
Whatever the cause, I can say to any
man who is ordinarily healthy and
Etrong that the trick can be turned in
Trcrn. five to eight half-hour lessons. It
took me five to get into the deep water
tar.k. and zny Instructor called me a pu
pil of his "third class." The first class,
or the quickest to learn, are boys from
10 to IS; next, girls of the came age. and
third, young men. They, knowing tho
dangers, are more backward. The boys,
having no fear, take to It naturally.
Lastly, eh great end glowing Joy, the

but chiefly to elt on the sand under a
sunshade and forget how much of them

privileges I've noticed that the bathing
eu't carries which are granted with no
other garb.
If I should propose to any g!rl of even
ordinary respectability locking my legs
about her waist and sliding down
the balustrade, shfi would be right
ly Indignant. I think. Yet, go
to the resorts and tanks and they lock
themselves together, men and women,
two, four and six deep, and shoot the
shoots with happiest abandon. I am very
glad I am learning to swim-
Indeed, the more I reflect about It
(this paragraph being- added some days
after the etory was written) the more
I like it. It Is pleasant to contemplate.

more especially that

arms and legs out to first position.
Then "when the arms have completed

is and how easily it Is to rest perfectly

and arms straight out from the shoul

fit of the thrust The stroke forces
the pupil forward, the instructor per

by the impetus. '. ;,
When the pupil has mastered this

the pupil should be taken back to shal-'

then In final shape- for the deep water
tank, where, with little practice and slow,
leisurely movements, he becomes a swim
mer. Seven or eight lesson 3 of half an
hour each usually accomplish this.
The dive is the last of the eight move
ments for the beginner. That should tea
taught after the swimmer has confidence
in himself in deep water and swims with
out the instructor. Standing as in figure 3.
with body in a semicircle and hands in
clined down to the water, the pupil sim
ply drops off and cannot do anything
else than make a perfect dive. As sooa
as the body is under water the hands ara
thrust down, bringing the body up. After
the drop dive of course comes spring
board diving, high and fancy diving and
under water swimming. But any person
following out these simple instructions
will find himself swimmer enough in
eight or ten lessons for all purposes of
health and recreation. Most peopla are
ready enough to leave highland fancy
diving and under tha water swimming
to 'experts. There are a few words of
general advice I would like to add:
Always breathe when the arms tire
coming back and legs are being drawn up.
Always secure an instructor, whether
friend or professional, in whom you can
put absoluta confidence. Mora damage
can be dona by Injudicious Instruction
and sudden frights than can be ovefcoma
in a good many months.
Now is the time above all times when
an Instructor should take no liberties
with a pupil. Should thB instructor free
the pupil under water fright would re
sult that in many cases would make al
most hopeless the task of restoring the
pupil's confidence. Another thing: No
instructor, or any one else around a tank
or swimming water, should ever duck a
person learning to swim without first
warning them, and even then not with
out their permission. "Women are pe

> * x^plVE me in a nutshell your
If definition of insanity," said a
i \iT vlsitor at' an asylum to the
i \^ physician in charge who had
i seen thousands of patients in
the course of seventeen years' connec
tion with the institution. After a mo
* ment's deliberation this answer came,
("Insanity is spiritual starvation."
i Such a diagnosis coming from a cool,
| unprejudiced expert is significant. It
would be foolish to draw from If the
'conclusion that any one. who starves
â¢ his spiritual nature, who is totally self
i centered and ignores the needs and
concerns of others, is likely to end; his
days in an insane asylum. If that were
'true there would have' to be a rapldin
crease in the number and size of such
institutions to accommodate iutureipa
i tients. .But the reply of this physician
may well start us to thinking of the
great riskswhich any one runs , who
starves his' spiritual nature. He may
not become a freak,' but: he is leading
the abnormal," not the normal life, and
by and by he may become warped and'
stunted,' practically malformed, for. the
normal life provides for the ..symmetri-:
"cal development of 'body, \u25a0 '. mind and

One'of the brightest," most successful

By right of his office his wife and
daughter stepped into an assured place
in society.
When beautiful Mattie Mitchell went
to Paris exclusive tsalons were opened
to her because she was "the Senator's
daughter," which without that would
have remained closed to even her pref
ix ty face.
And in spite of her ridiculously small
dot, co small that the world is as
cured it could only have been a love
match, beautiful Mattie -Mitchell be
came la Duchesse de la Rochefoucauld,
and Senator Mitchell became father-in
law to one of the proudest of French
nobles, chiefly because he .was Senator,
for without family distinction the
email dot never would have sufficed.
For thirty years he enjoyed distinc
tion, power, deference, adulation, all
the uncatalogued. honeyed perquisites
of high pla.ee, received his letters ad-
of favors at home, kow-towed to him,
gave him the front seat on the plat
form, the highest place at the banquet;
the tun of the list In "among those
present," would walk out of tlieir way
if they saw him coming in order to
meet him and to greet him so that
their world might see that 'the Sen
ator" touched his hat to them.
That one little motion of his dis
tinguished hand has been worth a
week's board for the young fellow
temporarily traveling on his uppers,
waiting for an appointment that was
in "the Senator's"' power *
It has been worth another month's
credit at the grocery to the hun
gry family of the man whose name was 1

weary way through the Pension Office..

dressed "to the Honorable Senator." and
then at the end a ruthless prosecutor,
totally devoid of deference, undismayed
by distinction, caught him by the
wrists and held up his hands before the
public, before the very people of .his
State who had been sending him for
thirty years to the Senate, and showed
them the stains of dirty money.
Mitchell of Oregon went in the. Sen
ate chamber, where he had held his
Beat for thirty years, â¢ and raised his
voice in denial, where his voice will be
heard, no more.
But the ruthless prosecutor made
good his charges; the Judge oa the

bench could not but see the truth.
Mitchell of Oregon was convicted.
Mitchell of Oregon, after thirty years
of being "the Honorable Senator," was
sentenced to six months in jail, and. a

Mitchell of Oregon was stripped of
his honors and his honor. \u25a0 ' '^ ;
The court, it Is true, was easy with
him, but Mitchell of Oregon walks the

His' brilliancy, his exceptional mental
ability and capacity for work, '. without
which brilliancy doesn't count, were

But'he chose to N be wicked. He liked

So he is an exile anrl.an outcast' to 7 day.
He has abandoned his home, deserted the

misfortune and disgrace the young

He has found out for himself whether
it pays to bo wicked, and the stripes

Of course there i 3 always the cynical
dissenter who will say in the end that
we, can never know whether it pays
to be wicked until we try it ourselves,
that we can only know that it doesn't
pay. and does pain, to be caught.
Such cynicism must be referred to
the little boy in kilts who so early
found that mere medicine was no cure
for the sickness of the conscience.
He is trying very hard â and very
humbly for Tod Sloanâ to rehabilitate
himself, and set another chance, yet
even he must have arrived at some
useful conclusion as to whether It pays
to be â wicked.
Tod Sloan stoutly insists that he has
avoided the doing of evil, but he has
not been circumspect enough to avoid
the appearance of evil, and he is suf
fering the consequence, the penalty of
being suspected.
Croker, the Tammany chief, could
perhaps give some valuable points on
the question.

It is whispered that John D. Rocke

Of course it doesn't sound like John
D. Rockefeller, it is not in keeping with
that hard, bloodless, vigilant old face
of his. but it may be true, and if it is,
it is his answer to "Does it pay to be

cooed comfortingly:
"Here, darling, take this. This will
make mamma's boy well."
Mamma's boy. sitting bolt upright in
the crib, eyes wide open, protested and
waved away the spoon.
"No, mammy, it won't. THAT isn't
what I need. I isn't sick. I'se Just
bad!" And he wept out in the torrent
of relief the confession of his wicked
ness.-
Yet. you need not turn to the little
boy in kilts, nor seek the answer in
experience, if you are asking yourself
this question in debating mood.
You can look in the high places.
If you want an answer convincing
and unequivocal you might ask Senator
Mitchell of Oregon:
Does it pay to be wicked?
For thirty years Mitchell of Oregon
was Senator from his State.
For thirty years he enjoyed all the
honors of the third highest office in
the gift of the people, for only the
Presidency and the office of Chief Jus
tice of the Supreme Court are ranked
as greater honors.
For thirty years he enjoyed the con
fidence of the people of his State. He
was their "bis man" at Washington.
' The political distinction and the so
cial distinction that attend the long
and uninterrupted incumbency of such
a high office were his.

Daly of Boston as. an example. When
he was at 160 pounds he could have
walloped anything- of his weight stand
ing on two legs. He is one of the"-po
litest men I" have knowrr, and in . any
company he would be picked out as. a
superior fellow, his good manners being
natural and not any; barber's polite
ness. Daly never knew what fear was,
and with his skill as a boxer combined
with his stout heart he. could have
made a record as a fighter that would
have smashed records right and left.
When Pete McCoy was at his best as
a fighter he and Captain Bill got into
an argument one night in Boston, and
McCoy, who didn't stop to pick hl3
conversation out of the good book be
fore expressing himself. Bald something
which Jarred Daly.
"McCoy," said Daly, "you've got * a
great reputation in the ring, and a
greater one outside of the ring, as a
man who whips everybody who opposes
him. Now, I'll give you a chance to
make a greater reputation If you'll
come out in the yard with me."._..*
McCoy, who was also a fearless
fighter, for once in his life wouldn't
take a chance. I always, had a great
admiration for Pete, but if he had ac-.
cepted that invitation, put to him in
the politest kind of language, X
wouldn't have given much for his
chances.
When I was sick at Nantasket Cap
tain Bill was laid up with blood poison
ing. He found It necessary to wallop a
fresh chap, and, cutting hi 3 flston the
fellow's teeth, the poisoning set in and
it was feared he would lose the arm.
Teddy's Indorsement of Fighters Is
Seconded.
I see that the President has told In
one of his speeches at a college that he
knows many prizefighters, and thinks
many of them are good citizens. That's
true, but it took a. lot of courage to
say it. Most of the people who go to
college exercises believe that prize
fighters are next to bank burglars. But
the opinions of good people on fighters
and bank burglars, as well as the opin
ions of fighters and -burglars on good
people are made up in a hurry on both
sides. I once heard Jlinmy Hope, who
plundered the Manhattan Bank, say;
"I never bother with a small bank.
The bigger the bank and the more coin
there is in, the easier It is. for the
more pompous the banker the stupider
he Is and the easier it is to do him." .
I give Jimmy Hope's opinion for
what it i 3 worth, not intending: to In
dorse it. But it may be said for all the
fighters I have known, not one of them,
would be guilty of taking rake-off 3
from the widows and orphans, as we
read some of the financiers in New
York have been doing. Perhaps the
President had something like this in
mind when he went out of hi 3 way to
say a good word for the men who take
their chance in the ring.
When you run your finger down, the
list of real fighters you won't run .It
into many black marks, not as many,
at any rate, as you will.r un- into by
going down a list of leading money
swappers of the present day., , \u25a0â¢\u25a0i/*i.Â» i â¢,'
Madam was eadly puzzled ' throughout
the next week. Wills haunted the houso
as much as ever, though Jessamine open
ly flouted him, at the came time smiling:
shy propitiation at the bishop-to-be. He
also was in a maze. Jessamine's encour
agement was. too elusive of madam, yet
sufficiently unsettled to make him at
times distrait. Wills glared at him. and
ostentatiously ignored him. It was that
which gave him the strongest hope. Wills
must be .jealousâ madlyv jealous. If only
Beveridge had never begun to court that
old woman! She was in the beginning
eager to play fairy godmotherâ lt < was
sickening to feel that he had disturbed,
this pious purpose, making the lady feel :
that she was not tqo old to inspire grand
passion- number four.
Presently he began to see light. He
would have It out with Jessamineâ ask
herplumDly to be Mrs. Beveridge, and
if she said "yes." go to matiam for her
blessing, along with arvr apocryphal tala "
of a distant wooer ready, to sue for her
hand. He could make it appear he had
been finding out her. mind toward a fourth
marriage. It would go hard with him
but that somewhere he would fiml a man â¢

good home. So he went straight to Jessa

music-rodriVwas at the very end of the
house,-4hus..well apart. There was small
chance of interruption; all the rest were
husy with games.: or flirting, or walking
in the flower garden under a white moon.
Jessamine went with- him. walklnsr-higii- .

the .mu'sjc.her hand, apparently by

softly. He- watched her with burning

â¢ â¢ I Mrs. Brookmere called acidly
\ from the west porch. As her
(% J granddaughter rose obedient-
ly. but with' a little impatient
sigh, her companion, Austin Wills,
whistled softly, then said: >'7-l
"'Jessamine!" What a wax Madam
Brookmere must be in. You're always
Sunbeam and Fairy and Bright Eyc3

/ "That is to say when the Beveridge

is when you comeâ and she feels it in her
bones when you are coming." = \u25a0
"H-m-m! I ought to be flattered, but
I'm not the least bit," Austin answered,
also rising and catching Jessamine's
hand. She looked aghast, but he kept
sturdily at her side until they were
facing Jessamine's dragon, then he said,
with â¢ his best flourish: "Oh, Madam
Brookmere, I have brought this young
person to .tell you why she can't pos
sibly come' in. She Is to go rowing

time. The afternoon is too heavenly to
be wasted on land." ; .
"Jessamine, go- upstairs -and fetch
my embroidery. Be sure you don't for
get my glasses," madam eald, as though
the youngr man had not spoken. Jessa
mine made to obey, but Wills held :ner
back. He lifted hia hat to the .elder
lady, turned and -walked off, saying
over his shoulder: "Send the maid' : up,
madam; it's bad luck to turn back; I
can't; allow Miss Jessamine to. risk
spoiling our cruise.',' ' .'. ; '*'.
"Oh, what will she 'do to me?"-Jes
samine cried as they hurried , away.
Madam had been too paralysed by.
Wills' audacity^ to say: a word. Austin
drew Jessamine's hand further over his
arm and smiled down at her, saying: "I
hope "it will . be ' 'Out -of my : house, \u25a0 ln
grate!' Then, you see, you will have
to come to my house, whether 0r,. n0."
"Mercy! You do take a lot on your

hand, her eyes dancing wickedly. '.'I
begin to fÂ»ar, Mr. Wills, that you have
taken our little affair seriously^â l â'.'
"Isn't it to be taken seriously? Really,
you lift a weight from my conscience,"
Wills interrupted in her own tone, i Then,
after a chuckle: "Jess, -, I must lecture

palps and showing yourself properly, de

cause of What John l>. Snldf-â A.
Caasttc Review of the Present Cham
pion's Career.
Jem Mace, champion of England,
â¢wanted to fight me four rounds. He
tried to get Al Smith, my manager, to
agree to have me make it a draw. Mace
said to Smith:
"If I fight with John I* and he
knocks me h'out It would break me
'cart.'.'
The rest of Jem's offer was that if I
would agree to make it a four-round
draw he'd announce from the ring- that
I was the best man he ever met. Smith
proposed that he make the match . on
the level, that It could be pulled off In
Madison Square Garden. New York,. and
there would eurely be a $20,000 house,
and divide the receipts equally.
"For that price you can afford to get
knocked out," Smith argued.
But Mace Insisted that it must be his
way.' To humor Mace Smith came to
me, told me the story, and asked me.
"What do you 6ay7" My answer, was
this: "If I tackle Mace I'll do my .best,
end let him do the same. All the fight
ing: I have ever done has been on the;
level and I won't auit to oblige Mace
or anybody else." \u25a0-..<\u25a0â¢. -' - .
Al went back, told Mace what I said
and pressed him to fight me under,
those conditions. Jem's reply was cute
and to the point. It was, "Not for the
bloody Bank of England." .
Mace fired a number of challenges
at me from long range afterward, but
he cent this message to my manager:
"Don't mind what I say. I have to
make some money, apd this way is the
best way to do It. It benefits me and
it doesn't do you any harm."
Declined a $250 Purse for Whipping a
Hully.
When I was at the height of my
career the story was told In all the pa
pers that I was to retire from the rink j
and, as a wind-up,- 1 would give an ex
hibition in a theater in Boston during
which I was to knock down an ox with
my naked fist. Nothing of the kind was
planned* for it would have been brutal
to use an ox that way. and I never
was brutal.
I never knocked down an ox, but I did
do up a calf on two legs. Once in Mount
Clemens a fellow who had made himself
a terror, looking for fight all the time,
attempted to jostle me off the sidewalk.
He diOn't know 'who I was and when 1
started to give him some advice he called
me a. name that meant fight, and he
made a lunge at me. I put him down and
out in two minutes, and for.. once he had
his fill of fight, and enough' to last him
till the cows came home.
When the people in the place found
that his joblots had got the walloping
he had been working for so long they
got together a pursÂ© of $250 and pre
sented it to me in a corner drug store.
I didn't take the money, but It was ex- â¢
plained that I'd done, the town a great
service and they'd' feel [mean ..lf Jthey_'
ditin't show their appreciation- in some
solid manner. . I hops the bully behaved
himself afterward, for although . I v re : t
fused the money the action of.* the citi
zens in raising the present showed that
they were ready to pay high for peace
so far as that particular bully was con
cerned.
Might Have Been a Baseball Starâ
Ball Players as Scrappers.
I just missed being a baseball star. My
stamping ground in Boston produced
more good ball players to the square
foot of mud than any place in the coun
try, unless it's the little town of Avoca,
Pa., which I guess . has the record.
When I first got the fever it was some
time before I was good enough to play
on even one of our scrub teams, but I
came along fast. Lew Brown was a
great pal of mine and he showed me a
few. and I was offered Jl2OO a year for
1573-S0 by the Cincinnati club.
In those days a ball player was ex
pected to know something about scrap
ping so to be able to stand off a crowd of
rooters In an emergency. I would have
been handy on and off the field, but I
didn't connect. A ball player to-day ia
better equipped for the game if h? can
handle his fists, as for instance the mix
up Jimmy Collins, captain of the Boston
Americans, had last year with Pat
Dougherty, at that time left fielder of the
Bostons. I didn't see the battle, but the
story is that Pat tackled hi 9, captain and
soaked him good, and Jlmmle was helped
out by another playerâ Dineen, I believe.
This happened off the field, and the
papers didn't say much about it, but Pat
was soon exiled to New York, where he
has had considerable to do with making
Boston sorry he left that town.
There's more real fighting on the ball
field to-day than there is In the ring, and
if. the players don't get good they'll make
baKeball as rough-housa as football.
Is Jeffries Retiring Because of What
John L. SaldJ
In the article printed by me In a num
ber of papers on April 30, I gave the
tip that I'd make Jeffries meet me be
fore many months,or I'd drive him from
the ring. A couple of days after this was
printed Jeffries came out with the pro
clamation that he was going to retire
from the ring right away because "flght-
Ir.g don't pay." Put what I eaid and
what Jeffries has done together arid
what do you make of it? Don't it mean
that he had a particular reason for sud-"
denly getting wise to the news that
fighting don't pay? He could easily, put
some thousands in his jeans by fighting
me. but he passes them up and ducks.
And so Jeffries, who began his career by
fighting a negro, closes it by *ide
stppping a better white man than he
ever proved himself. -.'^
Yes, indeed, Jeff began his career by
fighting. a negro. The negro was Hank'
Griffin, and the place Los Angeles in '92.
The boiler pounder haa given it out that
he fought the negro because he was a
terror to the community and somebody
had to Â»rfvc him a walloping to keep the
place. Nothing to it Jeff trained for the.
fight, and it was regular in every way.''
If be bad the right kind of Band in his
crew he'd have given me a chance to get
ticder bis crouch with a clout or two that
wculd mate him know that tor once he
was fighting- His statement that fight
ing don't pay Is too thin, for It is a re
flection on the American people, who hare
always- stood ready to pÂ«y big forany
heavyweight who wodd really fight. If
it hasir't paM Jeff IfÂ» because the people
dida't take roach, slock: In Mcl He's an
actor, not a fighter, and a bad-actor at
that. It's the bad acting that didn't pay. \u25a0
Jeff Happeuid at a Time \u25a0 When There
Were Only Second-Raters.
I, am not anxious to pluck any medals
from Jeff. Wear them early and often,
say I. Of course I am. sore that he put
me aside and made a sure thing of it by
hopping out of the game. But.no man
who ever saw-me tight will : say< he was
ever In my class. I always put my -.body
where an opponent could reach it, if he .
got that far, and I." never invented any
serpentine dances and cbuchee houchie.
crouches, to make it. so the other fellow
couldn't' get a run for the money. Every
man I ever fought ' found me erect In
front of him, man. fashion, and I've met.
men who could make a monkey of Jeff
the best day he ever saw. Jake Kilrain, .
Charley Mitchell and a dozen others I
could name were better boxers and bet
ter fighters than Jeffries. \u25a0" '\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0â¢\u25a0:\u25a0""\u25a0.';
It happened well for Jeff that he came
at a -time when there were only selling
platers claiming to.be able to stand the
gaff in the heavyweight class. , Fit*, 'who
didn't- belong in the heayywelght division,
had done up everybody there was,- which
Bhows how. 'shy the country 'was of the
.real thing In the flghtlng line. Those who
remember- the times when .there was
fighting that was fighting will not go
daffy over the record of . Jeff, from the
time he fought with a ebon to the , time
he refused to meet a white man, able and
willing. It's pretty tough; that, a. country .
as big and spprty ,&9, ours can' t', : at-, this/'
stage produce a*; champion with'Vrilpp'*
enough to give . 'all ;\u25a0\u25a0' white .claimants'-' a ;
chance at him. That la where ;; I ' ; thlnk a
champion should be at, and. I proVed'it
for twelve years to : the world; arid '.as
Jeff takes his place as a has been' he is
welcome to my opinion of . his : "perform- '
ances. \u25a0 \u25a0 ' '.â¢".- '. â¢ .
Your hands are too big.- you'll never
make a boxer, was one- of the bits .of
discouragement passed, to me when 'l was
beginning to attract notice as a puncher.
That was the popular notion at that time,
because Sayers, Heenan. Yankee" Sulli
van and some' other good men who. had \u25a0.
made their I tally and passed up had
email hands.. It sounds strange now, but
everybody then had the idea that to be
a champion a boxer must have hands

though Morrissey was 20 years; younger

and letting Morrissey alone for a. while,
he jumped over the ropes into the other

\u25a0He Promises to Put an End to Fight
Swindle*.
I'm going to make good the threat I
made to help put an end to the swindling
of the public by fake fights by getting
into the promotion game", myself. The
public knows that I never played any
tricks on them, and when I boost Jim
MrCormick over the ropes at Colma,
California. August 11. ana sick him on to
GuFtavus Ruhlin, you can gamble on a
square soiree. Billy Madden will be look
ing out for Gus, and Billy is as square
as you find them. To make the go 1 above
suspicion, the purse will go 75 per cent to
the winner and 25 per cent to the loser.
And it will be practically a finish fight,
so you can count on something like the
real stuff from the time the bell tinkles.
This match will be one of the most im
portant of the year for several becauses.
It will be en the level, it will be chock
full of real fighting between two men
who are top-notchers, and th# winner will
look more like a real heavyweight cham
pion than any "gent" now in sight claim
ing the belt. Jimmy Coffroth Eays Mar
vin Hart will meet the winner on Labor
day, but Madden doesn't think he has
the sand, and neither do I.
Of course I think McCormick will store
Ruhlin away, and if he does you'll see
things happen along the whole line of

" my **good nature" is, 1 hope,
proof agiiiiiit demands far more
unreasonable than yours.
Beginning at the top 4f the "con
demned list" â "heavy roasts of beef,
xnutum and hot pork." Beef is a
blood enricher, and with the other
irests â¢licmcd is a heat-producer.
They contain in larger quantity
than any other foods carbon, and on
this account arc valuable for winter
u>e. I need hardly say to a person
of j-our intelligence that the phys
ique most in peril in the heated
.term is that usually known as tho
"full-blooded." The tendency of the
blood in plethoric people is to the
cerebral vessels, distending them,
end thus threatening, iv excitement
or unwonted exercise, their rupture.
Persons with the same physical
habit are more liable to fevers.
Moreover, the fibres of these meats,
especially of pork, are tough and
difficult of digestion. .The digestive
system is relaxed by heat and less
capable of assimilating heavy foods.
As a housekeeper, you will readily
Â«tomprehend this when you recall
how difficult it is to mince meat
with a dull blade. Digestion, you
are aware, is accomplished by the
combined action of the gastric
juices and the muscles of the stom

Cleaning and Settling the New House
PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR THE INEXPERIENCED
HOUSEWIFE GIVEN BY MISS M. E. CARTER
Copyright. 1905. by A. S. Barnes & Co.
WHEN* settling a new house -with
all Its furnishings, also new,
an inexperienced housewife
may spare herself unnecessary
worry and fatigue by thoughtfully plan
ning the entire business from start to
finish. Of course, emergencies may arise
compelling occasional departure from the
original outline: nevertheless, the set
tling will go forward more rapidly and
with fewer mishaps if the superinten
dent have ever on hand for reference a
well-thought-out and orderly programme
of all the work to be done. A good
housewife is never without her notebook
in which she jots down ideas that will
further the work of house settling and
housekeeping aÂ» they occur to her, or
that she sets from outside sources.
A well-kept notebook proves an energy
conserver. a time-saver and a peace-pre
server to many besides the one who
keeps it.
JOT DOWN NIGHT THOUGHTS
When the mind Is crowded with un
wonted cares and thoughts, even an
ordinarily sound sleeper may become
wakeful just at the time when most
needing rest. Then the brain teems
with things to be remembered and fear
of forgetting makes one broad awake.
A simple practice soon overcomes that
sort of insomnia. Every night before
going to bed have a candle and matches
with pad and pencil on a table beside
the bed. Every time you wake with a
good idea, or a thought of something
that must be remembered, light the
candle and write it down. This relieves
the mind and you can go to sleep feel
ing assured that you have captured,
and can have, the thought when you
waken in the morning to transfer to
the Invaluable notebook. Never crowd
your notebook's pages. Space every
thing so that when looking for a memo- v
randum your eye will quickly light upon
it. A closely written notebook, is bet
ter than none at all, but it often taxes
one's time and patience sorely. Befora
every memorandum write in large let
ters one word indicative of the subject
of the memorandum. The nocturnal
notes may be very brief, even consisting
of but one word as a. reminder, because
the thought can be transferred to the
notebook more fully by daylight- In
periods of unusual strain, during night
hours especially, one's powers of self
control are tested severely, but the plan
just given has so often helped the writer
at times of immense responsibility It is
now offered with the hope that It may
prove equally efficacious to whoever may
be led to make trial of It. Seeking
sleep is futile while the mind Is over
weighted or given to sudden flashes of
valuable ideas which one fears to losÂ«
by falling asleepâ therefore, the neces
sity for unburdening an overcrowded
and consequently chaotic brain.
When about to settle In a new house,
or one already vacated where you hayÂ«
full possession, a supply of fuel should
be laid in at the earliest opportunity
that there may be no lack oÂ« hot water
to delay cleaning or to prevent thÂ«
workers being refreshed by the cup that
cheers without inebriating.
Working women generally are not
well nourished. They live on very light
food, as a rule, and need to be looked
after when they are working hard at
'housec'.eaning. They should be provid
ed with a hot lunch -'and have at mid
morning and mid-afternoon a little light
refreshment. Most of them are satis
fied with a cup of tea and bread and
butter at these times. No one-ever lost
anything by considering the comfort ot
employes. It is only a humane duty
that should require no urging for Us
performance. '\u25a0\u25a0> . \
There are hundreds of pretty, inexpen
sive covers, from the pale colored ones
to the wen-covered Dright grounas that
make such cheery looking places of
porch or room.
For boating, plain old-fashioned "Tur

which should be made to siip on and
off, and button down one side. Fini3h

BRIGHT PORCH PILLOWS
SUMMER furniture, with springs and
suit upholstered seats and backs,
"conspicuous by their absence." as
the French say. needs plenty of
pillows to make It absolutely comfort
able. And. somehow, plies ot pillows are
a whole lot cooler than most of the
cushioned furniture.
Tuck a couple of sofa pillows In your
trunk when you are gcing away, wheth
er it be for the summer or for a two
weeks' vacation. There's nothing like
n pillow for a long lazy morning spent
drifting around in a row-boat, nor for
easing up the too strenuous cords of a
hammock.
Gingham covers, in blocks of red or
blue or pink, alternating wit.) white, are
prettier made with the rultles, and a
pretty variation ot this sort of pillow ia
to make a rurtle of sheer, tine white
stuff, with a tiny lace edge and mount
it over a ruffle of the plain color.
Some of the non-ruffled pillows aro
finished with a heavy cotton cord,
which ends at one corner in a big. soft
tassel; or, perhaps, tassels will be placed
at each of the four corners. Where
there is only one tassel, the cord Is
knotted on each of the other corners to
cover the turning of the point.
Straw covers are made of two nat
squares, sewed together on the outside.
With ions basting stitches.
There's another cover, woven like a
rag car-jet, with qu~er. effective figures
thrown 'to the surface somehow in the
weaving. There are printed covers, ju^t
a jumbie of Oriental designs and col
ors a copy of tapestry patterns, or a
picture of a little scene, perhaps child
ish perhaps sentimentalâ like the fancy
head* which forma from the smoke o. a.
pipe, evidently puffed during the solitary
A host of covers come already made
up pay and pretty, none of them costing
much more than Â£0 cents. And. by the
yard are to be had even greater hosts
of stuffs, for 10 to 3> cents a yard, with
cords and braids and tasseU ranging
around 5 cents. - '
With materials to be had for so lit
tle more than a song, and the leisure
that always follows, to some Â«xtei:t. m
the wake of summer, pretty pillowsâ and
original ways of making themâ snoula
be easily achieved.
PRETTIER WITH RUFFLES
white ground almost hidden by the dis
play of color, which cost from five to ten
cents apiece, and can be made up in
several ways. Two will make a cover,
with the corners lied in on the wrong
side t-> give that little pushed-in effect.
Or. two others can be used for a ruffle,
either by cutting the sides off straight
or by cutting the puints off. and making
a ruffle of them.

The PrpperÃusinessand^ Visiting Cards 'fbr I^len

MEN'S cards are a great deal
smaller than women's and are
both narrower and shorter. This
year, the most fashionable size
fora man's card Js one and, three-eighths
by three inches. It be made of
quite stiff bristol-board and be en
graved with": the name ' in : full, always
preceded by the prefix "Mr," unless the
cards -are to be used simply- for ~busi
ness purposes. The address Is placed
either in the lower right-hand corner
or lower left-hand. The most fashion
able young men in New York, however,
put'tho address in the left corner, after
the English mode. Physicians arid cler
gymen invariably uso their titles" on
their visiting cards, as "Dr. Thomas B.
Wlilte' 1 or "Rev. John . Roberts Gray."
A doctor should have nothing beneath
his name on his vlsltinar. card but, his
home address. This may be put in cither
the, right or the left hand corner, as he
prefers. His- office hours. should never
appear except -on hln business card. -
Tht profeHbional title of a man should
never, urnj<rr any clrÂ«.-umstunces, appear
on *hfs .wife's card, "Mrs.. Judge. Brown,"
"MrÂ«. 'Colonel, Jenks," .orC;-::Mrs. ~ iDr.

rubbing together.
Rupture.
- If the abdominal band has not been
put on properly, or, the cord; has not
been well treated, there is often a slight
rupture at the . ; ; navel. Crying- seldom
causes this trouble if the band has beeii
properly put on. Remember, It should
be snug, but not tight, long enough to
go 'once and a half around the child's
abdomen, and neatly sewed on. the. left
side. It should never be pinned, for pins
often become unfastened, and It is also
easier for the band to become wrinkled.
When a rupture occurs a ring at the
navel may be felt through which a
mass protrudes; when the baby cries it
grows larger, and when he stops it
often will become very small again.
Ruptures should be treated very
promptly, as soon as noticed. It is best
to have a doctor or trained nurse show
the mother how to apply the rupture
strap, but if the mother cannot obtain
help, she may* put on the strap herself
in the following manner: \u25a0 â¢\u25a0
Take a strip of oxide of zinc adhesive
plaster about an inch and a half wide,
and long enough to reach three-quarters
uround the baby's, body; attach one end
of this plaster, to one side of the child's
abdomen- and with the other.hand gently
but firmly push back the rupture, and
bring the skin on either side of it to
gether so thai It shall meet and fold In
the rupture;-now brlng.over the plaster
right across the abdomen. so/-that it.
holds the folds of flesh over the rupture
together, and lirmiy attach It to the
other side of- the abdomen. This dress-
Ing should be changed every two days
and should be continued until the rup
ture has entirely healed.
Other forms of rupture in the groin
should receive prompt treatment from a
doctor, for they are dangerous If allowed
to continue. ',?;"
Babies, and How to Care for Them
PRECAUTIONS AGAINST AND TREAT
MENT OF MANY LITTLE ILLS
Ocpyiisbt, 1303. by A. S. Barnci & Co.
By Dr. Emelyn L. Coolidgc
AEIAPER should never be used
more than once without wash
ing. Remove at once when wet
or soiled, and place in a covered
pail in the bath room, and wash at
the first opportunity. Pure white soap
only should be used for this washing,
then the diapers should be thoroughly
rinsed and boiled. They should be dried
in the open air in the sun when possi
ble, and neter before the nursery fire.
Before, they are put on the baby they
should be warmed.
Thrush.
Thrush or sprue is often seen in the
mouths of young babies. It Is most often
caused by uncleauliness or carelessness
in ihe care of bottles and nipples, in
very delicate or marasmus babies It may
develop independently of these causes.
Rabies who are allowed to suck a "paci
fier." or a rag with sugar in' it, are espe
cially apt to have this disease.
Jn appearance thrufh is like little
v hite turds of milk scattered over the
mouth, the Inside of the cheek, tongue
and lips; but. unlike milk, It cannot be
rubbed off easily. It may cause so much
discomfort that the baby will not nurse:
in Kuch a case it will be necessary to
f*ed him with a dropper or spoon until
th* mouth Is healed.
To cure thrush faithful and very
gentle treatment Is nroessary. Twist a
piece of absorbent cotton around the
little finger, dip it in a solution of boric
ncid <orÂ»^ teaepoonful to a pint of *a
terÂ». and very gently wash out the
i-aby's mouth four or five times daily.
After each meal wash the mouth out
Tvith a solution of .bicarbonate of soda
dine teaspoonful to a cup of water).
Never use honey and borax, or any
other sweetened preparation, for they
only aggravate the disease.
Be sure the bottles and ripples are
properly cared for. and burn the
"pacifier" If one has been usedâ and
never replace it.
Chafing.
Chafing is one of tlÂ»e'most common
and annoying troubles that a young in-
Ifant lias to endure. It may be caused
by allowing the child to lie Jn a wet
diaper, not drying the folds of flesh
properly, too much or too strong, soap
i:i the bath or on the diapers when they
" arc washed, or by a failure to properly
waeh.lhe child after he has been on his
chair. Some babieg In a weak condition
arc very apt to chafe on the slightest
provocation, and because euch babies
often liHve fc-pitie also mothers some-
Jimcs think that the chafing is the
â¢vprue coming through.'*
The most frequent places for chafing
ar<?oi r the buttocks, in the folds of the
r.cck. and in the groin*.
When the baby is chafed do not use
M>ap on the affected parts, but wash
ihcai with water in which a bran bag
has been squeezed, or use pure olive oil
And 'no water at all. Very carefully dry
n\l lh.^ parts with old, soft lim-n, and
<lust thorn with v powder composed of
I'cjual parts of starch and talcum with
\'>ije-fourthaÂ« much boric acid, all thor
oughly mixed together. A powder corn
posed o( pure strarate of zinc com

American -Women" as Good Cooks
THE SECRET OF THE' BEST DISHES
"'\u25a0\u25a0:. ' MADE.H ERE'AND ABROAD.
WITH all ; our. strenuousness and
calm . appropriation of every
thing 'every other nation- has
done, we : ;- Americans are not
to be compared wlth'French cooks and
housekeepers -.-- when ~* It v comes either
to a question- of econojny or of combl
' nations that are unerringly rlghtr: :
Your true, Frenchwoman makes.: up a
soup oat of apparently nothing"â just
bits from here and thereâ and her inevi
table stock potâ flavoring it delicately
with the great variety of herbs of which
she has a most intimate knowledge, i
Every bit of everything* that is sea
sonable is used, and used in a matter
of-fact way that finds the most delicious
trick of cooking it, Instead of treating
it apelogetically-^and aa.unappettzlhsly!
There is no waste in her kitchen, and
nothing' ia i ever allowed to bear the
character of a left-over. \ She is^ pas't
mistrefs in the art of dressing, and as
clever in planning the management of
her cuisine. .' .. : â¢' 'V- 1 ':-<â¢"â¢
Half h'ef ..cleverness ties in the wonder
ful, sauces Â£ she -makes and serves with
every' sort of thing. . Lobster, with a rich
French sauce, is a dozen times more
toothsome than our way 3 of serving it,
and nobody knows how to give aspara
gus that last little delicious touch but a
Frenchwoman. â¢ - . '' \u25a0 â¢ \u25a0'
The very herbg she uses are different.
Wa know a fewâ and use them to death.
She uses dozens; and combines thÂ«m del
icately! Perhaps the greatest mistake
we make is when we try to use these
herbs of hers and put enough in to taste.
Instead- of nearly enough to blend Its
flavor with that cf the dish served. .
Salads and Dressings
â¢ Salads she has every day. and she has
a dozen ways of getting something dif
ferent up, from the -simplest of lettuce
to,the heavier with lobster and chicken
as the foundation.
" -French dressing is the most usual ac
companiment to plain lettuce leave*,
â¢which., by the way, should bÂ« washed
until thoroughly cleanâ those trouble
some little grains of sand that spoil *
salad must be got rid of-and dried to a
shaker as thoroughly as possible. If the
lettuce is large and coarse, strip off th*
centre rib and 'break the leaves Into
pieces.
Garlic As An Accompaniment
Mix your dressing at the table by put
ting generous dashes of salt and-nepper
in a tablespoonful of vinegar and beat
ing up' with three tablespoonfuls at
olive oil. Then put the dressing in. t&d
salad, and with fork and spoonl tarn
the leaves until each glistens with the
dressing. .-.'â¢..
Garlic is a well-known accompani
ment of many French dishes, and. If
properly used, is delicious. .A garlic
dressing for lettuce is made? by boiling
five 'pickled bulbs a few. minutes, and
then rubbing them to a paste with half
a teaspoonful of capers and one an
chovy. Salt, pepper and a spoonful of
vinegar, with four of oil. make th*
sauce. Chill and pour on the salad Just
before serving. \ .
And another salad dressing â for our
brother who dares not use eggs in any
formâ is'ltke a mayonnaise, but without
the sign of an egg. A couple of tea
spoonfuls of cooking mustardâ the finely
ground yellow kindâ is mixed with a bit
of onion, chopped as fine as possible.
and. of course, with pepper and salt.
Then stir in as much olive oil as the
mustard will take, thinning with a' tcÂ»-
Olesooonful of vinegar.
When finished it should look like may
onnaise.

If I win I choose for prizeThe San Francisco Sunday Call.no_textno_textno_textThe absurdity of the conception of lese
majeste is illustrated In several of these
cases. The King of Bavaria is a raving
madman who crawls about on his hands
and knees, barks -like a 'dog,, eats his
food off the ground like an animal, and
is altogether much more of. a beast than
a man. Nevertheless It is a criminal
offense to utter any. remark which, could
be construed as disrespectful to his royal
person. The . Prince -of LJppe and - the
Prince .of Reuss (elder - line) are ' also
hopeless lunatics whose dominions - are
governed by prince regents. The ' Prince
of Schaumburg-LJppe Is an , insignificant
Individual who reigns over \u25a0a . state 130
square miles in area, with a .total' popu
lation of 43,000, and the village of;Bucke
burjr, containing 6000 inhabitants, as its
line), the Prince of Reuss (younger line),
and the Prince of Waldeck.
MAD KING OF BAVARK IS
AMONG THOSE PROTECTED
carrying o:: a private conversation in a
secluded room In a private house utters
a disrespectful remark about the German
Emperor, his companion can denounce
him to the police for the offense of lese
majeste and his conviction will be almost
certain.
" It Is curious that the evidence required
by law to convict a person of the crime
of lese majeste is less than that required
to convict him of any other offense. The
evidence- of one witness alone is under all
circumstances sufficient to convict a per
son cf lese majeste in Germany. If a
father in the course of a private letter
i-.<-.fi t 'n a scaled envelope to his son
â¢were to insert a sentence which might be
construed as an Insult to the Emperor,
Jt would, according to German law, be
the bounden duty of the son to denounce
his father to the authorities for this
serious crime.
In public speeches almost every word
of criticism uttered on the Emperor, on
his method of givernment, on his foreign
policy, his domestic policy, his naval and
military policy, or any other of his pub
lic acts can be construed as lese majeste.
DIFFICULT TO TALK AND
AVOID DANGER OF ARREST
As all the world knows, the German
Emperor rules personally, being ;his own
â¢Chancellor, Cabinet, Government, head
quarters staff, admiralty and ecclesiasti

extremely difficult. If not impossible, to

varying from two weeks to six months
pending the conclusion of the official In

LEADS FAMILIES TO FRAR
THEIR DOMESTIC SERVANTS
During this period he has, suffered from
the disadvantage of being regarded as a
probable criminal, has lost-all his earn
ings, and probably suffers ,in health- from
the enforced confinement. Even if :he. Is
finally released without - a stain on his
character he receives no, compensation
for^the injuries done to him.
If domestic servants harbor feelings of
resentment against their masters they
can'easily wreak -an effective revenge by
denouncing their employers to the police
for the perpetration of lese 'â¢ majeste.
Many other opportunities of denunciation
and revenge which are . supplied by the
laws of lese majeste could be aired. Tho
German newspapers are full of reports of
cases of this kind. No foreigner can be
long in Germany without noticing the
reluctance of all Germans to' discuss the
Emperor and his doings Jin â¢ the presence
"of strangers. When the name of the Em
peror is mentioned It Is even possible to
Bee those present glance furtively round
as if to convince themselves that no nja
licious informer is present.
At . dinner . parties where the domestics
are serving at table all discussion of poll
tics^ which would involve mentioning the
Emperor's name Is cautiously tabooed.
Lese majeste thus "introduces- the poison
of mistrust and suspicion into German
social 4!fe. * The authorities do not neces
sarily wait for the receipt of .definite In
formation supported by the name of the
informer before leaking action against a
person suspected .of lese majeste. r.
,-An ,- anonymous denunciation " suffices to
bring about the, arrest on 'suspicion of the
person/ denounced.. : The / number of
anonymous â¢"; denunciations -. of , this â¢ kind
-which tho. German? police receive Is enor
mous. â¢/Nattfranyrin'the majority of cases
of this kind where no evidence is forth
coming the persons arrested are released
after a short period 'of detention,: but
nevertheless, owing to the anonymous de
nunciation; they have/ been submitted" to
the indignity . of ; arrest and the* Inconve
nience of compulsory detention at the
police station. .
BOY GETS FATHER JAILED
FOR j ALMOST HALF A YEAR
The following cases '-of convictions for
lese majeste" have been selected 'from the
official records of the year, 1904. In Feb
ruary, 1904,: at Stettin,' a boy named' Gus
tav Eberstein,' aged; 15; years, denounced
his father to the police ; for
the crime of 'lese majeste. The father
was arrested and . detained- for eight
Case of Friedrich Greulich Fairly Illustrates the System ~of
Tyranny That Is Approved by Kaiser Wilhelm:
The clauses of the acts relating to lese
majeste seem to have been purposely
â¢worded so loosely that they justify the
ividest possible conception of the offense.
Lese majfste can be committed by words
or by actions, in private conversations
and in public speeches, in private letters
as well as. in newspaper articles or in
books. If one of two persons who are
bne of the terrors of life in Germany.
It creates distrust and euspldoa between
trlenfis, hinders the friendly discussion
of current events between casual ac
quaintances and offers a wide field of mis
chievous activity to those who take a de
light Jn malicious denunciation of their
neighbors. Lese majeste. briefly ex
pressed, is the crime of uttering an in
rult to the ruling monarch of the coun
try. The character of the offense is ex
pounded In no less than 125 paragraphs of
the German statute book, and 900 books of
legal reference have been published for
the Information of lawyers on this com
plicated question. â¢":\u25a0;
The laws relating to lese majeste are
so worded as to make every, remark
.which is even supjjestiye- of disrespect to
the ruling monarch of criminal offense.

too trequent potations from the flowing

certain speech of the Kaiser's, "All Is not
Bolomonio wisdom that falls from the
Emperor's \lp&." ThÂ« next day Greulich,
,whd la a small milter In Berlin, was ar
rested and he has Just been sentenced to
three months* imprisonment for lese

Tills cast Is typical of the worklnga of
the law against lese majesteâ which is
! What makes the matter worse is that
the committal of the offense is not limited.
to insults to the \u25a0 Emperor, - because the
Emperor is not the only, reigning- mon-*
arch in Germany. The Federal German
Empire contains twenty states over
which independent sovereigns .reign.
These monarchs, insignificant as many of
them are, are constitutionally on* an
equality with their fellow-sovereign the
King of Prussia, who is tho German Em
peror; and lese majeste can be commit
ted by being disrespectful to any one of
these twenty royal personages.
They are the King of Bavaria (and at
present the Regent of Bavaria), the King
of Saxony, the King of Wurttemberg. the
Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin,
the Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz,
the Grand Duke of Oldenburg, the Grand
Duke of Hesse, the Grand Duke of Saxe-

Any guest who, at a public or private
dinner, falls to stand up when the toast
of "The Emperor" is given, is liable to
conviction for lese majeste. Lese majeste,
in short. Is a most elastic offense, which
comprises all sorts of varieties of di
rect or indirect references and sugges
tions of references to the imperial per
son.
It is, however, unnecessary for the "in
sult" to the Emperor to be actually ut
tered- It can be Indicated or implied by
bodily actions. If, for instance, when the
Emperor is driving through the streets of
Berlin any casual spectator fails to . take
off his hat as a mark of respect to the
imperial person he may be arrested on
the spot and will certainly be , convicted
of lese majeste. The excuse .that he did
not recognize the Emperor is not accept
ed as adequate. On the contrary the pre
cedent has been laid down in more than
one case that if a man did not recognize
the Emperor' he ought to have done co.
If a person were to point to a photo
graph of the Emperor hanging in a shop
window and at the same time had a dis
respectful or cynical or mocking or
angry expression on his face, and any
bystander construed the aspect of his
features as an indication of his feelings
toward thÂ© imperial person, that un
fortunate individual might also be ar
rested and subsequently convicted for
lese majesty. If any one looking at a
photograph of the German Emperor were
to express the opinion that \u25a0 the brushed
up ends of his mustache presented a
ridiculous appearance he would be liable
to conviction for lese majeste.

\u25a0o that the danger of lese majeste arises
In all conversations, debates, newspaper
articles and books.
One of the worst features of the statute
relating to lese majeste Is the wide op
portunities for Ignoble revenge which it
gives. Law and tradition together make
it th'\bounden duty of every German sub

SENTENCE SELDOM FAUS
SHOUT OF A TWELVEMONTH
Although the offense is not often pun
ished with this degree of severity, it is,
nothing unusual for a sentence . of two,
three or four years' Imprisonment to be
passed. A sentence of less than one
year's imprisonment for lese majeste is
Quite exceptional.
Official statistics reveal the number of
convictions for lese majeste and the se
verity with which the crime is usually"
punished. During the year 1904 there
were 3256 convictions for lese majeste In
Germany. Of this number approximate
ly 3500 persons were convicted for Insult
ing, the German Emperor, 250 persons for
insulting the King of Saxony, and 200 per
sons for insulting one or other of the re
maining German monarchs. The sen
tences passed amounted to an aggregate
period of 4098 years. It is, thus evident
that on an average more than ten per
sons are convicted in Germany on every
day of the year for less majeste, and that
the average punishment imposed slightly
exceeds one year's imprisonment. V
The official figures demonstrate the fact
that all classes of the ' population 'had
their share of punishment for less 1 ma
jeste/ The. total -of 3956 was . made : Up.
"roughly /as follows:. . 2400 " workmen^ " in
-towns. 600 agricultural workmen, 800 com
mercial men of air classes,- 200 women of
all classes, 100 professional ;men, and 100
children -under 16 years of age. It should
not be supposed that there were more
convictions in 1904 than In other years of
recent date. On the contrary, last year
the number of convictions for this offense
remained beneath the average for the last
quarter of a century.
GIVES OPPORTUNITY FOR .
WREAKING OF VENGEANCE
Tho readiness of the German police to arrest for lese majeste on the slightest suspicion gives opportunities for all sorts of malicious allegations arid revenges. The word of the accuser is nearly
always taken, and a discharged employe may send his former employer to prison for years by charging him with disrespect to royalty. Besides the Kaiser, nineteen royal personages claim
unfailing reverence by Germans, and of these three are hopeless lunatics, Bavaria's King- being of the number. Official figures show that during last year . nearly four thousand persons, including
one hundred children under sixteen, were convicted for "disrespect" to the Kaiser and other German rulers, and suffered terms of imprisonment aggregating 4098 years.

The change of rates by the Supreme
Lodge at its recent session in Atlanta,
Ua.,- which affects the older ages princi
pally, and .which," it was thought, would
raise a storm of. indignation, has been
received in this jurisdiction with a spirit
of fraternity which shows that : "the old
men" who. have been. protected for many
years at a remarkably low rate realize
that the change had to be made.for the
good of. the â¢ order, and there, has been
less "kicking" in the lodge rooms than
was expected. The various options that
are presented, under the readjustment
plan give all the members above the 60
year limit an: opportunity to j:ake a pro
portion of protection at rate's that will
not be more of a tax than it was in the
past.
- The Supreme Lodge has decided to ad
mit, women to the benefits of the order
on. the same footing as men. It will be
optional with lodges whether they ac
cept women as members.
All the lodges in the State have been
furnished literature explaining the new
plan; but the grand officers are visiting
the lodges for the purpose of . explaining

It ' Enables Her to Get Her American
Friends the Entree to All the
Royal Establishments.
LONDON. Aug. 5. â It is not generally
known how genuinely fond the Princess
of Wales Is of American women. She
was not always like this, but her ac
quaintanceâwhich began a year or so ago
âwith Lady Naylor-Leyland has changed
her completely.
English society people often wonder
why it is that American women latterly
have found so little difficulty in getting
to court. The secret is, and It is pub
lished for the first time, that anything
Lady Naylor-Leyland asks me Princess
to do will be done without a murmur.
Only those domestically associated with
both ladles can really tell how close the
friendship Is. They are "birds of. a
feather." Both are extremely' domesti
cated, and when the Princess wants ad
vice on any domestic matter her ladyship
Is the first to be appealed to. This is so
particularly since the death of the Prin
cess* mother.
In spite- of her influential connections
her ladyship is of a retiring disposition
and would rather not be talked about.
Her American friends who come to Ens
land to see what England Is can always
have complete access to all the palaces
and other royal establishments, the Prin
cess having made provision for all that
in consideration of her regard for her
friend. "

LONDON. Aug. 6. â Lady Newborough Is

in London to join the ranks of the auto

evil-smelling, nasty contrivance will ever
persuade me to abandon them." was a
favdrite saying of hers.
When she drove a pair of spanking
chestnuts in Rotten Row she handled the
ribbons with the expertness of a profes

driven a four-in-hand from London to

turn out to see how easily she controlled
her horses.

one of the best dinner table story tellers
in England, and anecdotes that might

Now that she has taken to motoring it is

controlling her horses.

English society women to have a chauf

public's desire for entertainment. . And
entertainment, . first and last, is what
they're after."
"I did it." this" of "Weather-Beaten
Benson," that is programmed without a
name. "Some folks say I'm ashamed to
put my name to it! It might be better."
Kendall mildly advanced, "but it was
put together in two weeks. Two July
weeks. The idea of trying to be funny
in July â when you have to keep one
hand to wring your hair out!"
In spite of that, I told Mr. Kendall
that to me "Weather-Beaten Benson
was far, far from "The Vinegar Buyer,"
something even approaching the dram
mer. And certainly the part of Benson
fitted him. ,
A little of what Mr. Kendall might try
at. as a dramatist, were he not a father
of six. came to light here.
" 'Weather-Beaten Benson' Isn't by
much what I wanted It to be," said its
author, perhaps a little sadly, and lean
ing forward to the story. "You know,
it's a good subject. I don't know- of
anything more pathetic than Borne of
those Oklahoma or Kansas 'rushes.' An
old man, waiting for the rain, always
praying to heaven and getting nothing.
Then you see the families traveling back
over the prairies, leaving a little grave,
mebbe. And the lone man. hiking back
to the wifeâ mebbe she's dead and he
doesn't know It. Fight, hardship, love
a-flowerlng among it, and then the great
poem of the coming of the rain."
"You are like every other comedian.
Mr. Kendall"â l began.
"Got the pathetic In my system V he
asked, and nodded agreement. "Of course
you have to have a deep sense of the
serious to begin with, before you know
how to turn it upside down and be
funny. But sometimes you don't want
to turn it upside down. Then it's ex
pensive. Goodwin will tell you that. It
cost him lots of money to get rid of his.
I take mine out in spots"
"Being the father of six â "
"Being the father of six. Mind you,"
ho elaborated, and returned to the dra
matic construction of "Weather-Beaten
Benson." "I can pick more holes In Ben
son than any one else. I guess. But I
believe It's pretty good entertainment,
and that's what a good many better
made plays are not. Isn't it bo? Their
construction may be Al, their plot
O. X., their characters clean-cut, and
yet they just lack the salt in the soup,
Just that little touch that makes them
go. In 'Benson' sometimes we hastened
on the construction, like a biograph
picture. Or we stuck things In that
don't belong just to hike the thing
along."
1 Instanced the semi-hero turning out
to be a thief and Kendall laughed -and
added, "And the water barrel incident.
A dramatic sharp asked me, "Why on
earth does the thief throw that paper
over the fence?' I had to answer quick,
so I said, So that I can get into the
water barrel.' 'But what do you want
to sret into the water-barrel for?' 'To
make you lauph.'l said. 'And didn't it?'
'It did,' he said.' "
Of laughs and laughs Kendall talked
then; of downstairs laughs and gallery
laughs. "You've got to grlve It to both,"
the humorist said. .'Til let It run four
minutes, say." he was talking of mono
logues In particular, "for the down
stairs people, then I'll hand them up
one to the gallery. Then back again,
then another hot laugh upstairs. Some
times a person downstairs 'will say to
me: 'I didn't like that part of your
monologue, Mr. Kendall' â meaning the
upstairs bit. But I say, 'Can't- you sit
quiet a minute for those boys up there?
They sat quiet for you, you know.' "
Before his monologuing the actor told
me he had played long, for eleven
years, in "A Pair of Kids," and before
that in a Dickens "company. Here he
had played . the Artful Dodger, Tilly
Slowboy, Mrs. Gummldge. Oliver Twist,
Tommy Traddles. The company played
nothing but Dickens. The entertain
ment was called "An Evening With
Dickens." The billposters and carpen
ters called the manager Mr. Dickens â
and "were sorry, Mr. Dickens," when
the house was li^ht. It was a failure,
of course.
"Why, of course?" I queried.
"It was too artistic I guess," Mr. Ken
dall settled it, and wondered why they
played no more Dickens, while I de
cided that the humorist might have
been cut out for the genre. He is a
born Tom Pinch.
Aloud I wondered where in Shake
speare Mr.- Kendall belonged. "No, you
don't." Mr. Kendall laughed. "Perhaps
a Falstaff, and if I go on getting fat
I shan't be able to look lean and pa
thetic much longer. Can't get any
sympathy when you're fat. Ever notice
it? Fancy a fat Antonio! The gallery
would Just hoot at the pound of flesh.
They'd tell Shylock to cut it off any
where."
He summed success up thus: "If
you've grot the horse to drive you'll win
out; but If you have a dead one you
may finish inside the money â and you
mayn't. And who wants that? A fel
low wants to be first In his class."
And I left Mr. Kendall, "first in his
class." . -

"Mebbe you think It's easy to be
funny?" queried Ezra Kendall. There
\u25a0was mild cynicism in his drawl % in his
indistinctive blue eye, in his small, firm
mouth as he spoke.
No, I didn't think it was easy to be
fur.ny, I assured him. I saw too many
folk fail at the game to think it was
easy. Nor did I think it was easy to
say just where fun became fun, nor
what particular kink or twist of the
commonplace made it fun. I had come
to him as to an expert.
We were chatting in one of the
suburbs of the vast parlor at the Pal
ace. The humorist had wondered why
the hotel folk didn't cut it up into lots.
Nobody *ver sat there, he said. I
pointed to us. but Kendall retorted
that we were '"a poor house," with all
respect to nae.
"Was it the worst he had had!"
That was telling. Kendall smiled to
It. At any rate, he told me. It was a
better house than the first one he had
had here, and that was at the Orpheum.
/.n<l the Orpheum was full at that.
"It isn't beet to be clrcused," the
humorist prefaced. "That was the
trouble with me when I first came
here. You know" â Give him the quaint
drawl, the kind kink to the eye, the
close, droll, sweet-make of mouth of
Weather Beaten Benson, for this is
Kendall and it is not Kendall without
than. "You know," he went on. "I
came to the Orpheum first for a four
week season. I came on two weeks
ahead, to get some local gags and try
to live up to the bill boards. There
wasn't anybody but me those two
weeks, I tell you. You had to stand In
line to buy me a drink. Meyerfeld told
'em: 'You've seen the others â but
wait? They waited, and I worked be
tween drinks. I worked till I got a
good monologue â knew it was good.
Then I went on."
An eloquent pause, as the novelist*
s&y, paused here.
The humorist translated it "Well,
the audience didn't agree with me. They
tock me like a kick in the Btomach.
There wasn't a hand â there wasn't a
foot all the way through. Some chap
did knock over his umbrella or some
thing trying to get out, and that cave
me the chance to come back. I bought
my own drink at the bar. Not a soul
came up to ehake hands with me. MÂ«y
erfeld stood over at the other end of
the place. His la.cc hung down so I '
don't think the bartender could see all
of it. I don't blame him. They'd j>Jt
big money on me. Then Carroll John-
r son walked over my way; asked, me
why I hadn't sprung some of my forty
niners on "em, like I did East.
" 'I've got four weeks here,' I told
Johnson; 'can't give 'em the best first.'
" 'Are you going to give 'em the came
etuff to-night,* he asked.
â¢â¢ 'You've guessed It,' I said.
" 'Think It'll go better?' says he.
" 'Think it'll go worse,' says I.
"But It couldn't," the humorist re
marked to me. "They were two of a. kind.
I had my drinks by myself and came
home. On Monday nightâ well, if rd
hired them to laugh they couldn't have
laughed harder. You couldn't stop them.
At the' finish all you had to do was to
point your finger at 'em. Meyerfeld
came beaming up to me and asked me
how I accounted for the difference? Sun
day audience, I told him."
"The Sunday audience?" I echoed.
"You don't get the best audiences on
Bunday," Kendall insisted, "I've noticed
it everywhere. They're amateur audi
ences, so to speak. Now, they'd thought
that in that local stuff I was guying the
townâ fur be It from me!"
"You wouldn't if you could, would you,
Mr. Kendall."
But he continued, eyes a-twinkle, "The
Monday night audience knew better."
"You gave them Just the same stuff?"
I inquired.
"Exactly," the humorist told me. "I
knew I had a good thing, the only thing
uas to make them know. Sltck to your
pcint and you're bound to land it."
Not for nothing, I thought, is there that
gritty little mouth, gritty under all Its
gentleness and sweetness, in the face
KendsJ] has made for himself, and the
humorist went on to: "I've.. never let an
audience down me. It is Just pie for them
if they can get away with you. But I
like pie myself. I've had audiences â in
the little towns you know â even hiss me.
1 iust hiss with 'em!"
f "Hiss with those that hiss"
"Yes." he Â»odded, then laughed a lit
tle and added, "anything but laugh with
these that laugh. That you can't do.
If you laugh at yourself nobody else is
poing to. But you can do a real tear
occasionally and they will use up their
laundry with you. Queer things, audi
ences. But there's one thing sure, you
must have the goods, and there's an
ciher thing surer, you've got to believe
in your goods or nobody else is going
to."
"Isn't It difficult sometimes." I asked,
"to keep faith in your goods?"
"Oh, yes," the humorist acknowledged
â¢ pushing back his well-grayed locks. "And
again, no. It is the keeping faith in your
ability to deliver the goods, being patient
with yourself and the audience, that Is
the trouble. For instance." another of
fcis rare, open smiles lit up the gentle pes
simism cf the face, "you remember the
fellow that sings his part in 'The Vinegar
Buyer?" "
As one of the brightest spots of that
dramatized Joke book, I told him.
"That idea came about this way," the
humorist related. "The scene was some
how flat and something had to be done â
come salt put in the soup. So I got the
idea of having Loui* sing his part. 'What
do you think of it?" I asked the manager.
'Fine! Great!' he said. "They always say
that,' the humorist added. ' and leave
you to bust or make it. Well, I dinged
at that boy until be didn't sing in more
than five keys at once, and we started.
.He was a flat failure that first n!ght. *ne
manager came to tae and said: 'You've
made a mistake.' "
"No mistake," I told him.
"But it was bad. wasn t it?" he put It
to me.
"Rotten!" said L.
â¢â¢That's what I'm telling you." he said.
"That's what I'm telling you." said I.
"And." Mr. Kendall went on. # "for
some weeks that part continued to be a
failure. At last St. Louis loomed up on
the bill. That was his town. He came
to me and asked If he couldn't leave the
singing out. 'No.' I told him. He
didn't want to make a fool of himself
before his home folks, he said. 'Well,
don't." I said. But the manager came to
me then and said the boy had given no
tice â what should he do? Take it. I
told him. But the boy had tq go on at
St. Louis, and somehow, the minute he
opened his peeper he got a. laugh. Well,
he* kep' a-singlng after that â within
easy hail of the key â and the people
kep' a-laughlng with him. He took back
his notice in a hurry after that.
"A family of six to support," Mr. Ken
dall explained, was behind his theories
of dramatic construction. Incidentally,
he said that that was one thing he ad
mired the Mormons for. children were
so fashionable among them. "Couldn't
be too many children." the humorist put
It. and I fancy the Kendall sextet must
be very glad when papa comes home to
dinner.
"It is a beautiful thing." the father of
six remarked, "to be so highly artistic

Ing at 2005 Greenwich street, where a
home had been prepared by Mr. Oxnam.
Bishop Hamilton, with the assistance of
Rev. Mr. Coyle and Rev. Mr. Heacock.

of friends, among whom were several
minuters of the Methodist denomination.
Mr. and Mrs. Oxnam have long been
recognized lor their earnest work in the
religious field, and have the sincere con
gratulation of a large number of personal
friends.
A wedding of military and social im
portance was that last Wednesday of

McLellan. retired, was married in the
home of her parents, on Union street, not
far from the Presidio.

in New York.
Pursuant to rumor, t^ere is the pleas
ant news concerning Miss Jean Reid, who
counts so many friends on this coast.
Lord Brooke, son of me Earl of War
wick, is sitlcl to be a manly .fellow, with
laudable ambition toward statesmanship,
and clever and studious in his type. He,
seemingly, would be quite the affinity for'
Miss Jean, who combines worthy and
lovable qualities with a sweet person
ality.
Leaving romance outâ though It's the
last thing we want to do â iue -diplomatic
reasons for this alliance of peer and j
maid democratic are of weighty consider
ation, which _^the same is lying now In
abeyance.

To protect her matrimonial market the
Englishwoman resorts to foreign tactics
and makes open concession to American
charm by paying the flattering tribute of
Imitation which Is fast assuming an
aspect of sincerity In her adoption of
American mannerisms and Individualities.
The Englishman, with his proclivities
truant toward the American maid, must
In some way be enchained to his ancestral
sphere.
Our surface pride, at least. Is duly
touched, though the movement is of psy
chological value dealing as It does with
attempted transformation of Innate quail
ties.
As Is well known, the "methods" of the
Englishwoman as contrasted with those
of tho American are exactly 1 opposed, and
whatever her underlying belief in the ef
ficacy or propriety of Inherited customs,
a bound has been made In her outward
demeanor, drastic, capitulatory and in
bold compliment to this side of the water.
The much discussed American girl is
beheld In a new lightâ that of serving
as model for her English cousin's copy,
and before her Is made obeisance, an
cpen proclamation of .her superior fas
cination.
Peeresses of the realm are educating
their daughters to, emulate the American
manner and, that emulation may not
savor cf amateurishness, the fair pupil
of the land of the rose Is being trained
from her cradle.
Endurance and pity have passed, leav
ing only embrace for the potentiality of
the American temperament which has
won even the feminine portion' of the
generation.
For what reason? Self-preservation,
matrimonially, for the trophy is man.
Kingdoms have fallen, politics have
been changed in the name of woman,
but it remains for man to cause up
heaval of rooted tactics for his captiva
tion.
Surely 'tis love makes the world go
round, else why this disturbance. Eng
land's daughter, fair of face and modest
of manner, with commendable objection
is relinquishing from year to year her
stalwart lords to Columbia's child, viva
cious and graceful. Hence the assump
tion of an ,opponent's weapons which
will hereafter be wielded by the English
maid upon her own ground.

New York will, on Wednesday, be the

Mrs. James Gray left San Francisco
with her daughter a fortnight ago to
meet Dr. Graham, who will visit with
his bride many of the beauties of the

Probably the most brilliant and pre- '
tentious affair of the month will be
the' wedding of Miss Margaret H. Hawes
and Captain William G. Haan, Artillery
Corps.
This event wrll take place at the
San Mateo home of Mrs. Ernest Cox
head, sister of the bride-to-be.
In view of the prominence of the
coming groom the affair will be cele
brated with great military eclat, all
the details of pomp and power to be
vigorously observed.
Captain Haan. West Point. '89, holds
a record for achievement and bravery
second to none who passed through the'
various maneuvers and exactions of the
Phlllpplno campaign. The romantic
coloring to his varied experiences was
taken on at Manila, where Miss Hawes
was sojourning during a tour of the
globe.
With the ringing of these bells a
message of happiness will be sent to
many posts and stations where Captain
Haan has made and held friendships.

Lady Rosemary Cairns, daughter of
Countess of Cairns, is a delightful em
bodiment of English and American at
tractiveness, the latter influence appar
ent In her calm self-possession.
And all those acquirements for the
further conque&t of helpless man!
With the incoming of this beautiful
new hybrid is there a scent of danger?
Must the long-worshiped American look
to her laurels on English soil â that land
dear to the title-loving heart?
Still the air vibrates with weddings,
past, on the threshold and to come.
Summer has shown no dereliction in
these events, 'which are holding soci
ety's mind to constant alertness.
Just passed are those of Miss Helen
Partridge to George B. Chapin and Miss
Gertrude Shelton to Charles E. Bund
schu, the keynote of each being quiet
ude.
The Chapin-Partridge nuptials were
marked with great simplicity, not a
dozen persons outside the immediate
family circle being bidden.
St. Luke's was the altar chosen, Rev.
Cecil Marrack reading the solemn ser
vice at noon.
With the bride stood Miss Amalia
Simpson, both prettily gowned in soft
white crepe, Mrs. Simpson performing
the office of Bishop Partridge, who was
not able to leave Japan. Mr. Chapin
was supported by his brother Charles.
An attractive little home in Mill Val
ley is awaiting the return of Mr. and
Mrs. Chapin from their wedding trip.
Similarly planned was the marriage
of Miss Shelton to Mr. Bundschu. The
bride, a pretty Petaluma maid, was
wedded to the man of her choice at 8
o'clock in the Swedenborgian church.
Attended by Miss Alma Bundschu,
the bride was gowned in white samite
with veil of lace, point d'esprit being

Stout Ladles,
City Attorney. Long yesterday advised
the Health Board that it may not re
ceive for registry any birth certificate
after ten days from the date on which
the birth occurred. Long says that the
Political Code requires that "physi
cians, midwives, nurses and other per
sons assisting at a birth shall return
in writing within five days thereafter
â¢ â¢ \u2666 in such form as may be pre
scribed by the registrar a certificate of
registry of such birth â¢ â¢ â¢ In
case there shall be no physician, mid
wife or nurse attending at Buch birth,
then J- it shall become the duty of the
parents to make such return within ten
days thereafter."
The opinion is important, as It has
been the custom of Chinese to register
certificates of births many years after
their* occurrence and use them to enter
the country fraudulently. ? The opinion
continues: "You are. advised therefore
that you may not '\u25a0 receive for, registry,'
and. lnsert before an already numbered
and registered certificate, one subse
quently reported in point of time, al
though reciting facts indicating a prior
date, of birth. The . statute ; prohibits
any attempted insertion of a certificate
of birtli before another: or others re
ceived earlier in point of. time."

"The material life represents to us the
only real life. Why should we waste tlm*
trying to be spiritual while we are living
in a physical environment? We find our
selves here in a physical world endowed
with the capacity to enjoy the pleasures
of that world. We are not spiritual by
nature. We are physical beings and we
have needs and appetites no different
from those of the animals. After all, Is
there anything better for us to do than
to get all the good we can out of life
as we go alongâ to eat, drink and be
merry and have every bit of pleasure we
can? .
stress on the spiritual side of life
and fall to recognize the importance of
our physical existence.
Here is the substance of his argument:
A READER of this paper, in com
. meeting on a recent article of
mine, tells me. I lay too much
I during all the ages? \u25a0 Has" he not glutted
himself with pleasure only to find that
the flavor had gone out of life?. In satiety
has lie not found misery proportionately
greater than the pleasures he enjoyed?
I hold that a man is a spiritual not a
physical being; that, his has his origin
in a spiritual realm; that he
is rooted there, while he has an
outlook on this universe. His body is not
himself, but the medium ' through which
he expresses himself, the-. tool â¢ he uses.
The greatest '. mistake- he can make, |
then, is to regard his body as himself
and become merged in It, a slave to its
appetites and passions.' '\u25a0 \u0084
The truth, A as I see it, <is simply this:
That man's physical senses are S inade
quate to furnish all the good his soul
craves. The spiritâ the soulâ ln man de
mands'larger expression than the material
consciousness can give. Real happiness
and satisfaction are too big, too limitless
The physicar alone is not vast enough,
not high enough to interpret his needs
nor meet his craving. Hence his verdict
after bitter experiences, that life is not
worth living. Hence his dissatisfaction,
his disgust, his weariness of existence.
There are vaster regions' ln man than
he at present dreams. There is a deeper
capacity. for happiness in him than he can
know^ while he is hampered by the limited
fleshly concept of himself he now holds.
When he really sees that he is a, spiritual,
not a material being, he will know how
to live. .
The spirit in man is always crying for
more life, more happiness. In his Ignor

Indulgence in material pleasures only, but

An' the other hornets foil ercd, an' they stung, that gospel shark.

Into that guiltless hornets' nestâit's sickeiiin' ter recall.
When he comes to his home in Tokio,
where he lives in a simple house in
the outskirts of the city, he ceases to
be the grim sea captain and takes up
the simplest mode of life. About his
house is a. garden, anu here he may be
seen digging among his chrysanthe
mums which are his favorite flowers.
He loves the sports of the sea and is a
keen fisherman. Sometimes during his
leisure he hunts in the mountains. He
is a good shot. Unlike many sailors,
he has good land legs and often tramps
all day with' a gun and a bag of game.
Togo conducts himself with great
modesty. When he_ returned to Tokio
after his triumphs at Port Arthur his
grateful countrymen gave him a mag
nificent welcome. But he declined a
formal J reception, saying: "The war
Is not yet over. When we are through
â¢with- the Russians you; may honor me
If I live." When he left Japan he dis
appeared.' The next that was heard
from , him was his victorious engage
ment r with Rojestvensky.
Yet' the admiral is said to be a very
gentle man. - He is fond of .music and
sometimes plays the Japanese stringed
instrument called the biwa. Once he
invited a number of naval officers to
his house. After he played one of the
Satsuman airs he asked a professional
biwa player to divert the guests with
a patriotic song, "Entering Formosa,"
which tells the story of Kitashlrakawa,
a brave and lovable Prince, who died
fighting for Japan in the- Formosan
war. The monologue, with Its musical
accompaniment, moved Togo to tears.
He was unable to listen to the end and
requested the musician to cease.
. In. public Togo Is most retiring. He
almost shrinks from the people. But
the moment he Is on ship he becomes
the master. His very silence com
mands. ' The sea Is his home.' Shortly
before he took command of the fleets
he took a cold on land. He hastened
to his shfps despite the protests of his
family and ( friends. "I always get well
at sea." he said.
ALTHOUGH beloved by his men,
Togo is known as "The Demon."
because of the Iron discipline he
enforces, says the July World's Work.
Shortly 'after the war with China a
naval officer asked one of his men if
"the .demon Togo" was the same man
who had commanded at the naval sta
tion Kure. '
"Yes," said the officer, "but why do
you ask?"
"Because," replied the questioner,
"when I knew Togo years ago at Kure
he seemed to be a very genial but silent
man."
The senses of sight, hearing and taste
may be affected, causing defective
vision, deafness and complete loss of
taste; sensation to touch and pain may
be lost over certain areas of the skin,
or even over the whole body, so that
affected persons are unable to feel tne
prick of a pin or to distinguish the dif
ference between heat and cold; curious
abnormal, rigid positions of the limbs,
clenching of the fingers, various
paralyses, closely resembling- those pro
duced by disease of the brain and
spinal cord, are some of its manifesta
tions.
They may last for but a few hours,
though they have been known to continue
for months and years. Recovery from
them in many cases is sudden, taking
place often during some m&ntal excite
ment, or during periods of religious re
vival These hysterical manifestations
and their cure are the explanation of
many of the "faith cures."
When placed under proper care, recov
ery is nearly always rapid. I have
known a young girl, bed-ridden for
months with hysterical paralysis of her
legs and complete loss of sensation to
touch and pain, get well in a few weeks
when removed from her home to a Lon
don hospital.
Another case of a girl who would fall
asleep for periods of three or four days,
during which time she could with diffl>
culty be roused to take nourishment, got
rapidly well on removal to a hospital.
In the middle ages hysterical subjects
were regarded sometimes as saints, but
more often as possessed of devils. It
then occurred frequently; later on they
were supposed to be affected by "va
pours." which gave rise to these various
conditions.
A little while ago they were regarded as
shammers; attention to them was thought
to aggravate their complaint. To-day
these imaginary ills are looked upon as
something more definiteâ a disease of the
nervous system, the true . cause and na
ture of which will be one of the great dis
coveries in the future.
The neurasthenic is the prey of the
quacks and a source of Â»reat profit to
patent medicine venders; to him their
advertisements are of absorbing In
terest, he finding comfort and hope in the
published cures of cases such as his, and
with a hope that "springs eternal" he
tries for a time this or that patent
cure, only too often with little result
toward tho cure of his imaginary dis
ease. _
Can the manifestations of hysteria
be called imaginary? What hysteria
really is is not known; all that can be
said at oresent is that it is some dis
turbance of the hisher centers of the
brain; no actual disease of these cen
ters has as yet been discovered.
Its manifestations are wonderful and
many; the hysterical fit, resembling: an
epileptic fit, is of common occurrence;
the state of catalepsy, in which the
person may assume or be placed in any
attitude, may follow the fit.
FAITH CURES FOR HYSTERIA.
They are the subjects of mental dis
turbance. Attracted by any of the mor
bid sensations, they develop a morbid
dread of sickness and disease. As the
suggestions of these reminders"* and
fears are constantly present, the neu
rasthenic becomes saturated with them,
becoming morbidly self-watchful.
In some instances these morbid fears
pass Into Insane delusions and obses
sions â then neurasthenia becomes In
sanity. The woman who complains that
one side of her body Is bigger than the
other after taking food ia not very dif
ferent from the insane pauper pos
sessed of the delusion that Inside him
were two red herrings, Introduced Into
his body while he slept by an tarnate
next him.
The. complaints of the neurasthenic
are many; all manner of vayue sensa
tions, of heat and cold, numbness, stiff
ness, -v.eaknes3, fatigue, soreness, pain,
pressure, of headache, such as "no man
has ever suffered from before," each
symptom described with a minuteness
defying subdivision; every function,
every organ of the body being de
scribed as subject to strange sensa
tions.
If the general health is not good, ab
normal sensations have a greater in
fluence upon the mind. The struggle
for existence among all classes to-day
is keener than ever it was;. every year
it is becoming more so. A larger pro
portion of tlie populace use their braln3
in the struggle. Universal education ha 3
intensified this competition to live.
Overwork is the oraer of the day, the
whole nation now suffers relatively
more from nervous irritability; there
are more nervous, exhausted people,
more neurasthenics â the persons of
"imaginary ailments" â than there were
before this bustling age.
Overwork, associated with it anxiety,
worry, or excitement, quickly produces
this condition. The business man.
anxious for his ventures, works doubly
bard to secure success; the sleepless
mother, worn with care and nursing,
does double or treble duty, and finally
"goes to pieces" when the strain Is
over. The over-trained athlete goes
"stale," the younff professional man,
keen, but faced with disappointment on
the threshold of his career â these are
types of neurasthenics.
MORBID SELF ANALYSIS.
That the mind plays a great part in
the course and occurrence of -certain dis
eases is undoubted. There is a universal
dread of hydrophobia; a dog bite la ter
rifying, for it is the bite of the mad dog
that causes the disease. The mental
strain for the six weeks following any
bite is intense. Curious symptoms may
appear, cramps of the arms and legs, the
patient making a curious noise like the
bark of a dog, fully believing that he has
the disease, though his symptoms are not
those of hydrophobia, but simply an im
aginary ailment. Convince him that ha
has not the disease and his cure will
soon be- accomplished.
MISTAKEN SYMPTOMS.
OUR bodily ills are multiplied many
times over by the Imagination. A
pain in the back means to many
kidney disease, abdominal pain brings
thoughts of appendicitis, the uric acid
crank Imagines that every ache or pain
he suffers Is due to this acid system.
while the dyspeptic with a pain over the
region of his heartâ "a weak heart"âfan
cying his heart diseased, deprives him
self of many of life's pleasures, writes
a physician in the London Mail.
Truly, a little knowledge is a danger
ous thing. All these people are the vic
tims of their own ignorance. The art of
diagnosis is the most difficult that the
physician learns, and yet they diagnose
their complaints on symptoms the mean
ing of which, often in many cases, they
have searched for in some household
work on medicine. It is this self-conn
dence that produces so large a number of
these imaginary ailments.

SUNDAY ....AUGUST 6, 1905
GOVERNOR LA FOLLETTE.
THE Governor of Wisconsin has heretofore attracted but little
attention outside of his own State. When he was a student he
was an intercollegiate debater and won in a contest with an
oration on lago. After that, as far as the world knew, he had fallen
backward into the abysm of time. But he appeared in politics and
soon was Governor La Follette of Wisconsin.
Perhaps no State in the Union has older or deeper scars than
Wisconsin in the matter of railroads. The first railroads in the Mid
dle West were not built by capitalists. The Lake Shore road, now
an important link in the Vanderbilt system, was built by a lot of
Ohio farmers, who were the inventors of stock watering. Wall street
had never heard of that method of irrigating values, until those Buck
eye grangers, finding what a good thing they had in their railroad,
watered the stock tenfold and sold out, to live happy ever after. '
The credit that built the Illinois Central road was a land grant
made by Congress through the efforts of Stephen A. Douglas, which
saved the State of Illinois from bankruptcy. The first railroads in
Wisconsin were built by men who had enterprise but no money.
The fanners of that State needed exit to a market. It did not occur
to any Wisconsin statesman to get a land grant to build a railroad,
so in their extremity the farmers issued mortgages on .their farms
as a basis of credit to build the roads. .
The roads were built, greatly enhancing the values of farm
property, but when the mortgages matured and had to be paid there
was a fight that left its mark from Fox River to the lakes. Genera
tions descended from those farmers have embittered Wisconsin poli
tics, and the ancient feud comes down to inoculate the railroad ques
tion of Wisconsin with a virus as immortal as the poison in the finger
rings of the Medici.
Governor La Follette was born politically in the* atmosphere
generated in these conditions, and if the people have been permitted
to forget that railroads are abhorrent things and that Alexander
Mitchell and General John Lawler, the great railroad builders of the
State, were enemies of mankind, is not the fault of the Governor.
AIJ of the eloquence he poured upon lago when Ue was callow and
had a buibous forehead, in his riper years has been warmed over
and turned upon the railroads. It need not be. denied that they have
.earned a deal of it. Nor need it be forgotten that the lightest punish
ment and that they like best is words, lurid words, skyrocket ef
fects, like the oration on lago.
But while Governor La Follette's broadcast of language has not'
produced a crop of reform, it has grown a fine harvest of votes that
finally lands him in the United States Senate. He now is in the way
to become a national character, and there are those who looked to his
leadership for wise suggestion and the framing of legislation that
would protect all rights without denying any. But we fear that these
will be disappointed.
Governor La Follette's last appearance betrays an unbalanced
mind and mouth. In an address to a Chautauqiia association he
abused Rockefeller. Well, that may be done even by a sober-minded
man, though we expect from a statesman the declaration of a public
policy, a system of lawful regulation which will put bounds around
the Rockefeller we have and prevent the making of more Rockefellers
by the system that created this one and made him formidable and a
menace. ' H"' ''. ' .->â¢

El. Capitar.. and the soprano of Toolooleweak. were unseen and un
heard, because he saw a tin can with no goat to eat it, where a
camper had discarded it.
So Governor La Follette, riding over the grain clad prairies of
lowa in an Illinois Central car, heard not the whisper of the corn
blades nor the trill of the meadowlark, because the car did not suit
him. Other men had looked on the same landscape from the upper
deck of a stage coach, when the prairie was virgin and the fart
from Dubuque to Sioux City was S3O. and admired the beauty of the
unplowed country. Not so the Governor. He took the Chautau
quans into his confidence about that car and reached his climax, in
this sentence : "I should like to have the job of hanging Stuyvesant
Fish, president of the Illinois Central, for obliging people to ride in
such a manner."
Here is a Governor and Senator who tells a public audience that
in. his judgment the president of a railroad should be hanged if a
car on his line is out of order. Coming from a man in less conspicu
ous position such a fool's saying might be laughed at. But in him
it shows a mind in the aberrations of demagogy. Worse than that.
It is a license issued to a guest to kill the cook if the coffee is rriuddy
or the steak tough. It is saying to the lawless and restless and riot
ous, "If Somebody doesn't suit you, kill somebody in punishment."
It must be admitted that Governor La Follette has the courage
of his disordered ideas, for, without regard to grammar, he "should
like the job of hanging Stuyvesant Fish" himself, without calling
in the common hangman. Judged by this utterance, Wisconsin has
merely reinforced Ben Tillman in the United States Senate, and that
at a time when wisdom, deliberation and soberness of mind are
sorely needed in disposing of the great issues and solving the great
problems which affect the public welfare. Here is a Senator whose
remedy for everything is lynching.
PEACE ON EARTH.
THE Russian clergy of Orenburg have organized a war party
and besought the Czar not to make peace. His Majesty re
sponded in a martial spirit, though his response is capable of a
double meaning. It would be a strange thing if carnage and human
suffering continue as a result of this militant action of the servants
of the Prince of Peace.
The Russian church is the biggest spoke in the wheel of autoc
racy. It is able to pose almost as the Government itself. It has
been able to so control that apostasy from the orthodox church is
made a felony. It has suppressed the people, stood in the way of
their education and resisted all enlightenment that* would lift from
their souls the shadow of superstition. It is the most impressive
existing illustration o^ the evil effect upon human progress of the
union of church and state. As Russia has risen as a terror to the
world, the church has advanced as a controlling power within the
slate.
The clergy of Orenburg feel that if the power of the empire is
broken and it take its proper place as an inconsiderable factor in the
world's affairs, the church will be efismalled and its authority and
opportunity will be shortened. Therefore their warlike message,
unchristian though it be, is a direct plea for the continuance of their
power at the expense of a suffering people. The reservists are be
ing herded by the Cossacks, for shipment to slaughter in Manchuria,
while their famine-smitten families starve at home. But all of this
human misery fails to impress a church devoted only to the selfish
ambition to keep intact its power and regal state and circumstance.
It is the only modern instance in which a so-called Christian
church has closed its heart to suffering and demanded that the people
be sacrificed for its aggrandizement. The Shintos and Buddhists of
Japan are called heathen, but their priests have not interposed to
prevent peace and impose upon the people further sacrifices in , war.
Judged by the right standard, they are more Christian than their
brethren of Orenburg. : 'V
In Russia the church is all in all. It may not be considered re
markable, therefore, that this warwhoop from the altars of Oren
burg has weakened the peace party and strengthened the- faction
that want war as long as they avoid its sacrifices.

Poverty forces the Lawton family to
seek some place where they could live
economically and they choose the old
farmstead where the father was reared.
It is the doctor's idea that by this
means the afflicted and ruined business
man will gradually have his memory
restored by recalling the scenes of his
childhood, and thus gradually have the
powers of his mind come back to him.
As for what is the meaning of "The
Sign of the Fox,", that refers to one of
Brooke's heroic expedients to help out

To begin with, the Japanese are cruel

and their standard of mercy seems to
be so low that they cannot recognize
as cruelties things which impress us
as atrocities.
The proof, to my mind, that the Jap

lies in the fact that the grossest in

seem to pass absolutely unobserved on

KILLED BT A FALL. â Henry Gustave

termaster's Department at the Presidio, died
Jn the military hospital at that place yester
day from the effects of Injuries sustained ln
an accident last Wednesday. On that day he
went on the roof of his home. 14OT Lyon street,

' Residents and property-owners north
of Uniont street and adjoining the Pre
sidio reservation complained to the
Board of Supervisors yesterday that
the rain every winter floods their prop

LONDON, Aug. 6.â ls a large part of
the Old Testament merely a rehash of
ancient Egyptian myths? All theologi
cal Germany is stirred up at present
over a book which Herr Voelter, v a
German professor, has just published
to demonstrate that this 'is the case.
In "Egypt and the Bible," as he' calls
his work, the professor draws some
really surprising parallels , between
what he terms "the alleged history. of
the forefathers of the Jews" and the
mosl ancient legends current in the
land of the Pharaohs. In these latter,
he declares, are to be found exact
counterparts of Abraham, Isaac. Esau,
Jacob, Joseph, Moses and other Old
Testament characters.
According" to Vpelter, Abraham repre
sents the Egyptian sun god Num. whose
wife, Nunet, has, like^Sarah, a child of
promise in her old age through whom
the future world is to be blsssed; jsaac
Is Tallemus, the god. of spring, and Re
becca, who covers herself with a ye;!, is
Tslar, the evening star, the daughter of
the morn god. Rebecca's, father, Bethuel,
the professor goes on, corresponds almost
exactly to the Egyptian Sul. Abraham's
three wivesâ Sarah, Hagar and lvetura"liâ
recall the three wives ,of the Egyptian
god. Voelter adds that in the stories of
Hagar and Isis the resemblance is par
ticularly striking, and he affirms, further
that the history of Joseph is practically
that of Osiris, who was at enmity" with
his brethren. He also was imprisoned in
a pit and from a prison cell mounted the
steps of a throne.
A pathetic account of Count Leo
Tolstoi is given by. Yurievsky, the Rus
sian writer, who has just, returned from
a vlsK to the novelist. . . .
"Tolstoi's condition," he says, "is one
of profound melancholy, for he is fail
ing In mind and body. He Has orily
one enthusiasm' left, the simple life; he
still insists on doing a certain amount
of rough manual work every day and
in the spring even- tried to plow his
own fields." * >
Yurievsky adds that Tolstoi considers
four-fifths of his life as wasted, but
doubts even that his present experi
ence would help him to anything bet
ter were he young again. The war
he still pronounces. "an infamy, against
humanity," but steadily refuses to join
the liberals in their campaign against
it. - \u25a0 \u25a0-/-â¢ii "\u25a0 i \u25a0 . . \u25a0 :
Of. course it was a foregone, conclu
sion that the ancient quarto edition* of
"Richard III"â sold very recently at
Sothehy's-: â would \ fall.; into;<American
hands. \u25a0 And, while regretting.. the- loss

cious quarto because of its association
with the Perms. The record-breaking
prices given "for it Is the surprising
thing. No such sura as 15750 ever .has
been raid for a .work, or even/ a collec
tion of works, by Shakespeare. - Four
years ago the 1623 first folio of all the
plays established a record by realizing
18600, and. when last year, a first quarto
of "Henry IV". '.fetched , $5175,- experts
generally declared that this, was ' the
highest possible market valuation " for
a single play. ...
Moreover, this copy of "Richard III,"
discovered so accidentally, Is by no means
in good condition. -Of Its 46 printed
leaves, half are \u25a0 scorched at the top cor
ners ar^d many are badly stained. .It was
a comparative certainty, however, that
no other copy of the edition ever would
come Into an auction room, for only two
other specimens are. known to exist and
one of these in the British Museum
and the other in the Bodlean Library at
Oxford. The present work was, of
course, the property of Admiral Sir Wil
liam Penn,. father. of the founder of Penn

places in the volume. It Is supposed
that his Quaker, son, forgot toinclude the

Commissioner ; Pillsbury laughed.
The commission took an adjournment
etnoon yesterday, until 9 o'clock Mon-j
day morning. :It is hoped -to finish, the
questioning/of the . students- on that
day. Most-.ofsthose graduates who live
out of town have,beÂ»n sent home.
Dr.- Faith Sal' So Leong,; a little Jap
anese girl who,is amongthe graduates
whose license Is being held up, ap
peared on the stand yesterday and tes
tified that she knew entirely nothing of
the whole affair. V ','You scare me," she
said,' as the rapid questions "were fired
at her. . â¢ \u0084 \u2666'\u25a0-
Drs.' Frank McClaskey and W. C.
Smith testified that" both the questions
in the possession of Dr. ' Lew Smith and
those given out by Dr. Dunn were very
broad and could apply to -any examina
tion In anatomy. Dr. ,W.C. Smith said
that â¢ Dr. Lew Smith was "the heavy
Josher" about college and when he told
the 'boys' that he ' had the "straight
dope" he did not mean that, they had
been given him by any- member of the
board. . .frj ; â¢-â¢â¢: :
Dr. Herrick, secretary' of j the board,
said he was not in possession of the
temporary license, /.books -, and that he
wanted the commission to demand them
from Drs. Dunn and Cool." v
DEMANDS LICENSE BOOK.
Very little was accomplished yester
day in the~matter of throwing light on
the giving out of the questions. Before
the sitting began Dr. Brasch, accused
and by his' own statement guilty of
giving money to Dr. Coke for Dr. Dunn,
appeared and .handed in his temporary
license. Two newspaper ' men were
sworn and they testified .. that Dr.
Brasch had admitted to them that he
had paid $100 to Dr. Coke for Dr. 1 Dunn,
in direct contradiction to his testimony
on the \u25a0 stand Friday.' .; They also said
Drc Brasch, had said that "he would fix
Hullinger good arid plenty" for what,
he had done. " ' "r" r ~p \u25a0 ,\
The "solid five." Drs. Mayhew, White,
Herrick, Howard and Baird, "through
their attorney, Walter" Braun, say that
Dr. Dunn proceeded contrary " to law
when he granted this license to Dr.
Brasch whether he actually took money
or not. They allege that Dr. Brasch
was a- candidate' before them last De
cember and that' he was rejected. at that
time. They then quoted' the law from
the volume called the "General Laws"of
California, 1903," page 33, -section 11,
which reads as \u25a0 follows: . "In : cases
where a person is entitled to an. ex
amination for a- license, but when the
board of examiners- is not \u25a0in session,
one member of the said -board may ex
amine the applicant and furnish him a
temporary license to practice dentistry
until the next regular meeting .'of the
board, when he shall report the fact, at
which time the temporary license shall
expire. Such 'temporary license shall
not be granted by a- member after the
board has rejected" the applicant." It
is under this lastclause of the law that
the "solid five" 'maintain that' Dr. Dunn
acted illegally. .* -"\u25a0 /
QUESTIONS GIVEN AIIE BROAD.
â¢ Yesterday's session of the investigat
ing commission showed. the evident in
tention of both sides in the controversy
to prove thatall the alleged improper
questions given out before the examin
ations were general and did not neces
sarily come from one who had a previ
ous knowledge of what the exact ques
tions In the examination would be.
Witnesses swore that some of the ques
tions said to have been given out by
Dr. Dunn were such as niight always be
given and that he merely happened to
have hit upon three or four. Likewise
witpesses testified that the questions
given out' before the examination by
Dr. Howard were also general ln their
nature and could cover almost any ex
amination' in anatomy of the head.
The matter of the alleged giving out
of the examination questions in ad
vance will be taken up and disposed of
before the .commission begins to look
into the alleged buying of certain mem
bers of the board for the purpose of
obtaining an illegal license. Commis :
sloner Pillsbury made the statement,
however, that this putting the more
sensational matter aside for the present
did not- mean that the commission
would not probe, to tha vflfy bottom of
the affair later. "We have been given
a very wide jurisdiction," he said, "and
we will take all the time necessary and
use- every lawful :means ; to find out
whether these irregularities do exist.
If there are certain dentists who' are
practicing in this State without a li
cense we want, to know it, -and we'wlll
take all steps .possible to sift the mat
ter to the bottom." * , \u25a0. :
SWEAR DX. lIKASCH .CONFESSED.
' These arc the questions which puz
zled the commission yesterday in its
Investigation of the alleged irregulari
ties of the Siate Dental Board. They
were busy examing the young gradu
ates of the University of California
and the College of Physicians and Sur
geons who took the examination in
anatomy last June, for which they are
supposed to have received the questions
in advance from some inside source.
As the college students took the
stand they told what they had seen or
suspected in' the peculiar vernacular
known as "college slang." To Commis
sioner Devlin this was perfectly plain,
for he was within the pale of univers
ity atmosphere not so very long ago;
but to Commissioners Pillsbury and
Cromwell, men of the old school, these
expressions were unintelligible, hence
their frequent questions and requests
for interpretation of many of the
terms.
Di^. the "heavy josher" get a "square
deal" or "wasn't he next to the
'Johnny?' " .
Is there any difference between
"dope," â¢ "straight dope" and ."good
dope?" What is the significance of
each? - . " â¢' \u0084

- &a^a^ Asrents.President Roosevelt formally opened the way to the Russo-Japanese peace negotiations when he received, aboard the Mayflower yesterday, the
envoys of the Czar and the Mikado and presented them to one another. The representatives of the warring powers fraternized with, the utmost
good-fellowship and the meeting was marked by their display of cordiality.
Gentlemen: I propose a toast to which there
will be no answer and to which L ask you to
drink in silence standing. I drink to the wel
fare and prosperity of the sovereigns and peo
ples of the two great nations whose representa

of all mankind, that a just and lasting peace
may speedily, be concluded between them.â

BERLIN. Aug. s.â Berlin at present
is making energetic efforts to shake oft
the accusation of provincialism so often
leveled against It. :
One of the chief points in which tho
German capital fails to equal Its great
European centers Is the matter â¢of
dress. Several months ago the Kaiser
took the problem in hand and gave or
ders that, at frequent intervals, "the
ater parties" should be held In the
Royal Opera-house* and the Royal The
ater. No one of the male sex was al
lowed to enter, these theaters without
being, in evening dressi with a white
tie, and every woman had to appear de
collete. \u25a0'\u0084..'
; The . enforcement "of this imperial
ukase led to some stormy scenes. The
officials of. the ' Royal Opera refused \u25a0to
allow women with high necked dresses
to enter tne stalls. They showed, how
ever, consideration to female patrons
by providing a number of dressmakers,
who, with scissors, needles and thread,
improvised the required decolletage out
of offending high-necked garments.
Now one of the leading Berlin hotels
has undertaken to teach its patrons how
to dress for dinner. It has transformed
what was formerly the leading ball-,
room ~of the capital into a magnificent
restaurant. The management has de
cided to make it a 'rule that all persons
dining or supping there must be In
evening dress and that the swallow/tall
and the white tie are "sine qua non" to
being allowed to cross the threshold.
The experiment Is being watched with
interest, but not too much confidence Is
felt -In Berlin that It will Â«uccÂ«e4.
the Treasury Shaw has wired Captain
Ross of the revenue cutter service to
proceed at once to New Orleans, princi
pally to superintend the revenue cutter
service at that point, with a view of
strictly maintaining quarantine. Captain
Ross is now making the annual inspec
tion of the service on the Atlantic coast,
and to-day is at Portland, Me. It is ex
pected he has already left there for New
Orleans.' Secretary Shaw said to-day that
the strongest effort will be made to con
fine the scourge inside the city limits of
New Orleans, and he had every reason to
believe that this would be accomplished

Special Cable to The Call.
The causes of the discontent appÂ« ar
to be unexplained. While rebellions ate
in progress in; other Germ.m-Afr'can
colonies, East Africa hitherto has been
quiet . The- outbreak therefore causes
some 4 concern. The Governmert is
thoroughly tired of these colonial wars,
in which considerable -sums: of nior.ey
have been sunk without bringing *Mtl:c-r
profit or glory.; ':,â¢\u25a0 'Â£. â. .

BOARD OF WHICH THEY WERE FORMALLY RECEIVED BY PRESIDENT ROOSETELT, AND PRESENTED TO ONE

As the Japanese mission, headed by
Baron Komura and .Minister Takahira,
ascended "the; gangway, all attired In
black frock coats and shinyJsilk hats, the
band sounded . three ! ruffles '.\u25a0 and then
played a march: At the head of the gang
way Commander Winslow. received the
envoys, ; and as they, stepped \to ; the deck
they were -greeted by Mr. Peirce. 'They
were escorted '. Immediately "to the j cabin,
where the ' President was awaiting them.
Their reception was brief ' and .was as
devoid of. formality as the nature, of ."the

One after another the President person
ally greeted and shook^ hands with the
officers of the ship. \u0084';.' -
The President was accompanied by W.
Emlen Roosevelt and Colonel Charles S.
Brqmwell, his military aid. He chatted
animatedly with his friends agd the of
ficers on board, commenting particularly
and with evident pleasure on the beauty
of the day. .
Meantime the cruiser Tacoma, with the
Japanese envoys and their suite on board,
had arrived from New York, making the
run In two hours and three-quarters. The
ship came to anchor at 12:30 o'clock about
a half-mile from the Mayflower. Almost
at the same time the naval yacht Sylph,
with Third Assistant Secretary of State
Herbert H.D. Peirce on board, also came
to anchor a short distance frdm the May
flower. Mr. Peirce, who in the . absence
of Secretary Root -was. to represent the
Department of State at \ the ceremonies
incident to"" the reception, boarded the
Mayflower from a launch about ten min
utes after "the arrival of the President.
He and the President chatted a few min
utes before It was reported to the, Pres
ident that the Japanese envoys were
about to come on board the Mayflower.

Perched high up in the rigging of the

As . the launch bearing the President

As President Roosevelt stepped on the
gangway to ascend; to the deck of the
Mayflower, the first gun of the Presiden
tial salute of twenty-one guns boomed its
welcome and -the beautiful Presidential
pennant of blue. and gold was broken out
at the masthead. The President was
greeted by Commander Winslow as he
reached the : deck. The band, after the
sounding of four ruffles beat on the
drum, played "The. Star-Spangled Ban
ner." -
The President greeted cordially General
Grant and Rear Admirals Coghlan and
Slgsbee, saying to the last in response to
his apology for not having on his uni

In; order that no questions of

avoided the necessity of seating tho

The flowers used principally in the
floral decorations was the gladiolus, a

IMPARTIAL TO RIVAL GUESTS.
The day was ideal. After the sun had
burned away the haze of early morning:
the weather was glorious. A^ brisk
breeze just tipped -the waves of Long
Island Sound with silver, tempering at
the same time the heat of the sun's
rays. The handsome war yacht May
flower, one of the most beautiful, ves
sels of the United States navy, on
which the formal reception of the Rus
sian and Japanese plenipotentiaries
took place, swung easily at anchor just
at the entrance of Oyster Bay from
Long Island Sound. A quarter of a
mile away was the dispatch boat Dol
phin, the favorite cruising vessel of
several' Presidents of the Unite^ States.
Two miles out in the sound the cruiser
Galveston was anchored, in waiting i.he
convoy the vessels bearing the envoys
to the seat of the Washington peace
conference at Portsmouth, N. H. '-
\u25a0-\u25a0 The Mayflower, is in command of
Commander Cameron M. Wlnslow,
President Roosevelt's ' naval aid, who
was detailed to this city as an especial
mark of distinction tothe peace com
mission by the President.
Before the arrival of the President
and the envoys the cabins of the May
flower were handsomely decorated with
flowers. The luncheon table in the
main saloon was laden with flowers.
"ALL NATURE S MILKS."
OYSTER BAY. Aug. s.â History v was : ;
made to-day in "Oyster Bay.' Russians'
and Japanese clasped hands and i
greeted one another with all outward
evidence of cordiality, and, for the first
time since nations began to have rela- |
tlons one with another, an executive |
of a great power received the envoys i
o- two belligerent countries on a mis
sion of peace.
President Roosevelt, on behalf of the !
United .States and its people, extended !
formal greetings to the representatives
of Russia and Japan, Introduced the
plenipotentiaries to one another and en
tertained them at an elaborate lunch
eon, at which Russians and Japanese
fraternized with one another as com
rades; rather than as enemies.
During the luncheon President
Roosevtlt proposed a notable toast, in
which he expressed the "earnest hope
and prayer, in the interest not only of
these two great powers, but of all civ
ilized mankind, that a just and a last
ing peace may speedily be concluded
between them."
The occasion was impressive. It was
attended not by pomp 'and' ceremony,
but by a simplicity and frankness i
characteristic of the President and the
people of America. <
Due honor was paid the distinguished
guests of the President and of the
country and they received all dignity
to which their exalted rank entitled !
them. j
The heart-broken parents were taken
to the home of Frank Costa, the father
of Mrs. Ferreira, who lives at- C 56%
Kennedy street, where a doctor was
called to attend the mother, as it was
feared for a time that her mind would
give way under the strain of her awful
experience. The bodies of the three
children, burned beyond recognition,
were moved to the Oakland Morgue.
The house and its contents were de
stroyed. *\\ ,-
The fatal fire* was caused by the ex
plosion of an oil lamp, which was
standing on a table in the kitchen,
where Mrs. Ferreira had just finished
bathing her 6 months old boy, who
was the only one of the children saved
from the flames. Mrs. Ferreira had
laid the baby on a couch in the kitchen
and had gone into the yard for a mo
ment when she was startled by a loud
report in the house, and, rushing back
into the dwelling, she found the in
terior a mass of flames from the blaz
ing oil, which hud ben scattered broad
cast. The mother caught up her
youngest child and ran into the yard,
where she handed the baby to a neigh
bor. who had been attracted by the
glare of the fire and the screams of the
frantic mother. She then started to
re-enter the house to rescue the other
children. By this time, however, the
entire dwelling was burning fiercely,
and other neighbors who had arrived,
not knowing that the children were
still in the house, held the mother,
fearing thftt she would sacrifice her
own life if she again entered the house.
When the fire broke out the two boys,
Antone, aged 6 years, and Alfred, aged
2 years, were in bed, and the daughter,.
Talvina, aged 4 years, was playing on
the dining-room floor. After the fire
had been extinguished the body of the
latter was found face down on the floor
near one of the dining-room windows
and the bodies of the boys were found
clasped in each other's arms on the
floor of the bedroom, having evidently
left bed in a vain attempt to escape.
The flre was first discovered by J. F.
Flgeroid, who lives at 968 East Twenti
eth street, who turned in an alarm from
box 149. Almost at the same time an
alarm was turned in from another box
by Special Policeman D. G. Murdock.
who had seen the flre from a corner a
block away. Murdock, after turning in
the alarm, hurried to the burning house,
being Joined on the way by Deputy
Sheriff Manuel Dameral; and the two
officers tried twice to enter the dwell
ing to rescue the children, but were
driven back by the flames and smoke.
In the second attempt both were burned,
but neither was seriously injured. By
this time the Fire Department has ar
rived and the flre was soon under con
trol.
OAKLAND. Aug. s.â Hemmed in on
all sides by the flames and smoke of
their burning home, with every avenue
of escape cut off. three "children, the
sons and daughter of Antone Ferreira,
a bricklayer, livlng'at 652 Valdez street
in East Oakland, were burned to death
to-night before the eyes of their frantic
parents, who were unable to fight their
way through the flames to rescue their
little ones.

Amona: the cases to-day is that of
Archbishop Chapelle of the Catholic
diocese of XÂ»w Orleans. The Arch
blshlp returned several days ago from
the country. His residence, while not
in the original infected area, !\u25a0 not far
distant from it. The Archbishop was
reported to be doing: 'well to-nlsht.
It was also asserted at the City
Board of Health to-night that the
Marine Hospital Service would take
charge of the local fever situation on
Monday.
Though there was an Increase to-day
over yesterday in the number of fatali
ties, the fact that the wjiole yellow
fever situation is to pass immediately
into the control of the Federal Govern
ment has had such an encouraging 1 ef
fect locally that it 4s felt on all sides
that there has been a distinct improve-
trent over conditions during the past
r;'ew days.
The city will continue to exercise
its police authority in co-operation
with the Federal surgeons; the mu
nicipal authorities and the citizens'
committee are to carry on the cam
paign of cleaning: up.' the two health
boards are to perform many of their
functions in conjunction with the Ma
rine Hospital service and Xew Orleans
expects still to be called Hpon to fur
nish funds to carry on the flght. The
actual handling of the Federal situa
tion itself is to pass to the direction of
the Government. which It is expected will
Bend a large number of yellow fever
experts to work under the supervision
of Dr. White. Rigid rules are to be
made and efficiently carried out In con
nection with the scientific treatment of
cases.
The Federal authorities make no at
tempt to conceal the fact that the'sit
uation Is serious, but they say that It
Is not without hope, and success Is pos
sible In spite of the headway the fever
has gained, particularly in the foreign
sections below Canal street. The fact
that the infections In the First. Fourth,
Sixth and Seventh Municipal Districts,
which lie above Canal street and con
stitute modern New Orleans. Is relative
ly small, leads to the hope that vigilant
observation of all cases in that quarter
while the more direct campaign pro
gresses below will enable the authori
ties to keep more than half of the city
free from .serious infection. Of the
deaths to date only five have occurred
above Canal street and of them four
were Italians who left the Infected
neighborhood in the vicinity of the
French market, and the fifth was a
merchant, who did business In that
' quarter. Of the cases, except those
most recently reported, all have re
covered or are on the way to recovery.
The trouble on Lake Borgne between
Mississippi guards and the Louisiana
Naval Brigade is considered to have |
ended. So encouraging were the con
ditions to-day that Governor Blan
chard sent orders to Commander Bos
tirk to withdraw part of his force.
The Southern Pacific Railway is still
l.aving trouble in handling the United
States mall. It has used an engine and a
freight car to go through Calcasieu, but
finds the method of handling troublesome
and extensive. The decision of Iberia
Parish, east of Calcasieu, to put up her
bars against everything; added to the dif
ficulties of the road. It was reported to
day that Dr. Edmond Souchon had sent
his resignation to Governor Blanchard as
president of the State Board of Health.
The report gave as the reason his dissat
isfaction growing out of the action yes
terday in asking the Government to take
control- At Dr. Souchon's office the re
port was promptly denied.
â¢ Much complaint is being received In the
city from people living in the country
districts against the arbitrary quarantine
rules that have been put into effect. The
result of th,ero is that many communi
ties are already beginning to run, short
on supplies, and it is desired that the
-authorities here shall do what is possible
to eecure a relaxation.

She was soon lost and a constant search
during: four days produced no trace of

BELLEVUE, Neb., Aug. 6. â After ly- j.
ing in the mud and sand of the Missouri '
River f or i fifty-three years, the old;
steiaVboat City of New . Orleans., has '
been uncovered by the recent high wa- |
ter and its cargo of 160 barrels of,
whisky probably will be recovered. The '
remains of thw boat were found two
miles above this place. The finders have
pl::ctd guards in charge and are rig- '
Sing a derrick above the old hull so j
that" the barrels may be hoisted out. I
The City of New Orleans was one of â¢
the early steamboats which plied the j
Missouri River, and was owned by Cap- j
tain LaÃarge of St. Louis. In 1552 the
boat wont up stream, having a cargo of
160 barrels of whisky for traders near I
Sioux City. !
Near night the vessel struck a snag {
and sank, the crew taking to the boats. >
The hull drifted with the stream, and:
although efforts were made at the time
to locate it they were unsuccessful.
Originally the cargo was supposed to
have been valued at $75,000, but .fifty
year-old whisky Is worth much more
to-day than the same grades were when j
new, ;
During the high water of this spring \u25a0
the Missouri began cutting into the ;
bank above Bellevue, with the result!
that when John McCarthy and another j
resident of Bellevue Island were row- j

Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Aug. 5. â Captured by
two highwaymen, who forcibly took her
,/ront her nance* in a lonely road in
"Little Coney Island" district of North
Bergen, N. J., early this morning, Lo
retta A. Pfeiffer, the nineteen-year-old
daughter of Henry Pfeiffer. a jeweler,
collapsed from fright and a few min
utes afterward died of heart disease.
After robbing the girl of a silver
watch and rings* the footpads aban
doned her wlien they realized the gra%'
ity of her condition, and she was found
in. an unconscious state on the steps of
the home of Patrick Sullivan, former
Chief of Police of NortJi Bergen. Car
ried into the house, she breathed her
last after a few incoherent words and
before physicians could be summoned
to attend her.
in thu meantime Nicholas Mountry,
who had escorted her to North Bergen
and to whom she was engaged to be
married, was trying to find money to
satisfy the demand of the robbers, and
he knew nothing of her death until
after the case had Been taken up by the
police. He was detained as a witness,
but his story of the attack, though cir
cumstantial, was afterward corrobo
rated in each main detail, so that no
suspicion attaches to him.
There is little hope of the apprehen
sion of the highwaymen, as no clew to
their identity exists and the place
where the affatr occurred has lately
been infested by rough characters.

the argument is practically reiterated"
in certain peace quarters that Presidi-nt
Roosevelt would not have risked His
prestige by a second tender of good
offices without having learned the
minimum Japanese demands and the
maximum Russian concessions anÂ«l
without pretty clearly seeing his way
by his personal influence to the pu'.tlng
aside of whatever differences may bar
the way to the bringing about of peace.
The Slove says, in part, that Russia
needs a lasting peace and that such a
pcr<et- can only come through an alli
ance' with Japan. It hopes that the
special powers" with which M. do Witte
is invested will permit him to d<Â»al with
the question of a possible alliance, but
deprecates Che possibility, masked by
an indemnity, in connection with such
an alliance.

It is a mere matter of statistics that there are more houses vacant in San Francisco than ever before, because people
will not submit to the inconvenience of riding in the slow, dusty and jolty streetcars of San Francisco when they can just as
' easily be whisKed across the bay (out of the fog into the sun) inio Piedmont in fast, clean, comfortable boats and swift, smooth-
running electric cairs. '
This condition of affairs is bound to continue.
With increase of traffic, San Francisco's streets will become more and more congested, and the street car service, in
consequence, will become still worse. ,
On the other hand, there is no limit to the speed bay ferryboats may attain, It is probable that, within a few years,
the Piedmont boats will maKe the bay trip in seven or eight minutes/
The electric cars will also run at increased spee^âiwenly minutes from the Ferry to the Piedmont Station is not an

It is very clear, therefore, that ais time goes on, such lots as those in the beautiful OaK ParK Tract, within three

investment or with intent to build there a home. -

"SAN FRANCISCO Aug. B, 1905.
"Mr. John Vance Thompson â Sir:
Tour letter is an insult, and under ordi
nary conditions I would pay no atten
tion to it. but as there are matters re
ferred to in the communication which
are of great importance not only to or
ganized labor in general, but to my
personal status with regard to organ
ized labor In particular, I waive such
insults as are embodied therein and
make reply thereto:
"The abusive language which you in- I
ferentialiy charge that I used in refer
ence to Mr. Ruef was not uttered by me,
and I have always discountenanced such
langruage and advised against the use of
it by others.

himself as Mayor of this city and coun
ty because, since the advent of Herbert]
George in this State, Eugene E. Schmitz (
has shown himself to be a man of prln- >

plain people generally and labor union- ,
Ists in particular can afford to intrust

Never in my life have I spoken to Mr.
Ruef in the presence of Mr. Gray, nor

Regarding the manner in which, as well

ANOTHER OPEN LETTER
The girl lived here for several weeks
unmolested. About a week ago, how
ever, he found her and visited the house
She refused to let him In, whereupon
he smashed In the door. Frightened by
the noise he left, but returned In about
an hour and again attempted to take
forcible possession of the girl's room,
but failed.
Yesterday afternoon he again went
to the girl's room. He found her alone
and defenseless. . For almost an hour
he pleaded with her to return to him.
He offered to make good his early
promise and make her his wife, but the
girl refused. With that Shealor be
came .angry and demanded that she
return to him a gold watch which he
had at one time given her. She re
fused to give up the watch, and then
blind with passion Shealor pulled his
revolver and shot her three times.
Turning the weapon against himself he
fired again.
R. E. Shealor, who owns a saloon at
California and Flllmore streets and for
whom the dead man acted as bartender,
arrived at the Central Emergency Hos
pital shortly before his brother died.
"My brother left the saloon about 4
o'clock this afternoon," he said, "tell
ing me that.be was going to see tho
Silver woman and secure his watch and
end it all. I didn't know what he
meant then, but thr-aght that he wa*
going- to leave the girl forever. The
two " lived together for about nine
month?."
Miss Silver still lives, but her chane
of recovery Is not good.' The girl vic
tim tells a pathetic story of her down
fall and battle against the temptations
of a gay life. She says she left her
country home near Grass Valley shortly
after her twenty-first birthday. She
arrived in San Francisco about a year
ago. Soon tiring of the monotonous
life. of a house maid and becoming ac
quainted with Shealor she listened to
his pleadings and consented to dwell
with him. She says the man promised
to marrj- her. After a few months she
Insisted that he kÂ«ep his promise, but
he became angry and beat her, threat
ening to kill her if she left him. This
frightened her so that she made no
other effort to compel the man to keep
his promise. At last, however, she
realized that Shealor did not intend to
keep his promise. She then left his
rooms and sought to hide In a house
at 117 Taylor street.
Late yesterday afternoon Louis
Shealor, a bartender, who lived at 2333
California street, called on Anna
Silver at 117 Taylor street and pleaded
with her to live with him again. -
She refused to return to Shealor,
whereupon he shot her three times, the
bullets lodging- in her head and back.
He then shot himself in the head and
died half an hour later at the Central
Emergency Hospital.

ered the initial address, introducing the
main speaker. Secretary Dan A. Ryan
of the Republican "League.
Ryan spoke in denunciatory terms of
the reign of graft through which
San Francisco has beoome known
to the world, and he suggested
that the members of the Thirty
third District use the ballot against
these political vultures Tuesday
and change the state of affairs. In
Ryan the audience recognized a man
who was not afraid to express his views
and many were more than ever con
vinced after his talk that the old play
of Schmltz's being a union man at heart
was a fraud.
The following speakers were heard:
John T. Pidwell, Charles E. Hand, John

Judge Dunne has decided 'that a
deputy poundkeeper is not a public of
ficer. The decision was rendered yes
terday morning in the case of M. Ed
wards, indicted by the Grand Jury on
a charge of bribery. It was alleged
that Edwards, a deputy poundkeeper,
on March IB last asked and received a
bribe of $15 from B. Mozettl, a dairy
man, for allowing Mozetti's cattle to
run at large on the public highways.
When" the case was called in Judge
Dunne's court a demurrer to the indict
ment was interposed, the main point
presented' being whether a deputy
poundkeeper was a public officer within
the meaning of the law. If not a pub
lic ohicer no public offense was stated
in the Indictment and it must fall.
In sustaining the demurrer the Judge
said: "It is clear to me that any person
appointed as poundkeeper by the Board
of Supervisors under the provisions of
the charter is merely the servant or
employe of the board, sustaining a con
tractual relation, and not a public of
ficer. But even if it be assumed that
the act of*the board in appointing a
poundkeeper thereby created a public
officer I am satisfied that it could not
delegate to such officer the power of
creating in turn public officers, indefi
nite in number and varying in their
duties and compensation." ,

A sample of Ruefs methods has been
exposed in the Thirtieth District, where
the hopeless effort is being made to com
bat the forces of clean politics that are
led by such a champion as Henry J. Mc-

Ruef has the aid of Frank French, the
boodiir.g Senator, in the Thirty-fourth
District. He has put up a ticket headed
by Fred V. Severance, who owes his nom
iration solely to French. Tho people of
this district felt keenly the disgrace which
was brought upon them when French was
expelled from the Senate and indicted for
his crime, and unless they desire to see
him and Ruef again in control they must
take the time to vote the San Francisoo
Republican League ticket. The ticket of
the league is plainly marked "Anti-
Ruef."
The people of this district are opposed
to the grafters, but It is feared that many
of them may neglect to vote. In order to
save the district it is necessary for every
voter to see to It that his ballot goes in
the box. Tho' only genuine Republican
ticket is plainly indorsed by the San

"Anti-Ruef."

stable. Pease has even gone so far as to
tell some voters that he is against Ruef,
although he reports to the boss every
day;
and his are bending every en
ergy to sex revenge. They have put up
a ticket headed by a dentist named
ICeene and entitled it "Regular Republi
can Ticket." .
The Ruef gar.gsters are making a des
perate attempt to capture the Thirty
fifth District, which lies between Seven
teenth and Army and Howard and
Church streets. Last year this district
repudiated the boss by a decisive vote.
The San Francisco Republican League
courita on a large vote at the primary
e.ection next Tuesday. If the merchants,
working-men and taxpaying citizens gen
erally who have been crying out against
the sctndals and unc'eanliness of the I
present administration of city affairs go
to the polls and vote the reign of the
Â«raXterÂ» will coon terminate, but if they
default in thtir civil obligations graft in
its worst form will be perpetuated.
Assurances come from every district of
tl><? city that a remarkably large vote
Wv.ll be cast. Jt is predicted that the
\ umber cf ballota deposited will exceed
BCOOGI and may come close to the 40,000
nark.
The leaders of the league hold that the
responsibility ia now up to the citizenship
of San Francisco. The league has done
6.11 that it is possible for an organization
to do to clear the way to success at the
baKot-box.
There is an old army maxjm that the
best thing to do when war is declared is
tc fight. When an election takes place
surely the best thing to do is to vote. In
this election the anti-Ruef ticket of the
Â£an Francisco Republican League should
l>e vcted. There is no other Republican
ticket. Delegates proposed by independ
ent clubs and sailing: under the caption of
"regular" have r.o intention whatever of
purporting the nominees of the Republi
can convention. They were nominated by
Huef to do Ruef politics in the conven
tion. If e'ected they vrill be programmed
to ncmina.to for ilayor a dummy pro
posed by Ruef In order to give Schmitz Â«
cji easy fight for re-election.
The desperate grafters under the
leadership of Ruef are casting- aside
every form of decency and fairness in
politics. Leading men are startled and
Chocked at the sight of their names ap
pended to scurrilous circulars.
They protest that their names have
been used without their knowledge or
consent, yet the grafters make no
amends or explanation, but simply or
fier the Japanese bureau to continue
ihe work of circulating: the forgeries.
Â«. The friends of W. J. Herrln were sur-
end gTleved to see his purported
Hgnature at the bottom of an lnfara
cus circular assailing the San Fran
cisco Republican League. Friends of
George W. Schell, an old-time Re
publican, who served the State in the
Constitutional Convention of 1878-79,
were surprised â¢when they saw his
r.ame associated with the ticket of
grafters. Herria and Schell Insist that
they have been misrepresented, but the
misrepresentation continues.
Horace Davis need not be surprised
or jolted if he should find his name at
tached to circulars commending 1 the
Ruef-Dlbbla ticket la the Forty-first
Assembly District. The grafters have
reached that, pitch of desperation that
they will do anything; to confuse and
mystify the rotera.
It comes to light that John Barr. who
is oa the Ruef tioket of the Twenty
eighth District being 1 registered as re-
Biding- at 18* Stevenson street, is not a
resident of tbt district. The directory
Ehows, and laea ot his acquaiatance
generally know, teat he lives at 36*1
Nineteenth street. Regular Repub
licans will see If he attempts to vote in
the Twenty-eighth.
Yesterday Frank Leach, Superintend
ent of the Mint, was advised that Jo
seph Hs-mill, an employe of the Mint,
â¢was on leave of absence, doing Ruef
politics in a district (the Twenty
eighth) in which he did not reside. It
is reported that Hamill Is visiting wa
ter front resorts and urging men to
vote the Ruef ticket. He treats civil
eervice regulations with the utmost
contempt.
A native son of Mongolian ancestry
yesterday exhibited a Ruef ticket, with
the re-mark that the Chinese were sup
porting that ticket, as Schmitz and
V.'io.t had given the Chinese "permit
W make noise in Chinatown." There
Zs not the elishtest doubt that the
grafters are appealing to the Chinese
for help.
In sending out pasters to the Forty
third Assembly District the San Fran
ciico Republican Leagne erroneously
announced that the voters of the One
Hundred and Third Precinct would vote

can not vote attlie primary election next Tuesday. Every one "who voted at the
Presidential election ot 19C4 or was registered ior that election and who has not
since moved from the precinct is qualified to vote at the primary election. There is
apprehension that well-meaning citizens will stay away irom the polls under the

The board had a lively discussion over
the accrediting of Pomona College, Los

as being up to the. standard, and to-day
the State Board of Education voted not
to accredit it. 'During the discussion it

Superintendent of Public Instruction. T.
J. Kirk, President F. L. Burke of the San

J. F. Millspaugh of the Los Angeles
school voted not to go further in the in

recognizing the college. Superintendent
Kirk stated to the board that he had re
ceived a letter from Professor George A.

with being responsible for tfce~ action

There, was some discussion as to mem

WOOSTER, Ohio, Aug. s.â Revelation3
o v f a new scandal in the Taggart divorce
case were made here to-day involving a
prominent United States Senatorial
Washington and another notable man
in the country's ofliciai life. â¢ -
"My turn will come next week," vehe
mently declared Mrs. Grace Culver Tag
gart to-day. "Wait until I get a chance
to prove a few things about my hus
band. I have witnesses and they will
be heard. You will readily see what
kind of people the wretches are who
have denounced me."
Mrs. Shallenberger, a nurse at Christ's
Hospital, Cincinnati, testified that dur
ing a long illness Mrs. Taggart was a
patient in the hospital, while her hus
band was stationed at Fort Thomas,
Ky.. across 1 the Ohio River. At this
time she had little recreation, according
to Mrs. Shallenberger, and told much. of
hgr life that had hitherto been hidden.
"She said," testified Mrs;, Shallehber
ger, "that while *>ho was* In Washington,
her husband being away, she would
spend her evenings with a certain
United States Stmutor and another high
politician.
"Her mother would always reprimand
her for this and threaten to write her
husband."
Captain Taggart's attorney sprung a
new witness during the duy. He was
Harry Loop, a butcher's boy, aged la.
Loop teHtitied that two weeks ago Wed
nesday he was at the bar of a Wooster
saloon when Mrs. Taggart looked In
from a back room and ordered three
glasses of beor. She drank. one glass
and her two boys drank the others.
What Loop said on cross-examination
did not shake his testimony.
Mrs. Taggnrt is nerving herself for
the most severe ordeal of the trial of
the divorce case. This will come when
she take? the stand to tell her story of
her married lite and to vindicate her
hoflor. In her story on the stand Mrs.
Taggart will detail her version of all
the incidents in the garrison at Fort
Thomas, Fort Shericdan and Fort Leav
enworth, on which the charges against
her are based. Then the story of her
life in Cuba, San Francisco, QrovUle.
Woostcr and in the Philippines vjvill be
told v It is announced' by Attorney
Wertz that Captain Taggart will take
the stand against his wife on Tuesday.
Most of ill.- testimony to-day was
that of army oHicersj for Captain Tag
gart and was In the form pf depositions.
The Sixth Infantry, in which Taggart
was a captain, has been sent to the
Philippines and all the officers who
knew of the troubles that led to the
separation cannot appear in person. One
who will appear next week Is a retired
officer from Pittsburg.
Harry Rope, one of the witnesses who
testified against Mrs. Taggart during to
day's'proceedings, was tbis evening ar
rested on a warrant sworn out by Mr*.
Taggart' s attorneys charging him with
perjury. Rope was later released on
bond.
\Vitness Rope's testimony was given
this morning and brought from Mrs.
Taggart the most- pronounced dispaly
of emotion she has shown since the
trial began.
Mrs. Tag-gart sat undisturbed through
minute descriptions of many alleged
immodest acts, but when the witness
claimed to have seen her offering in
toxicants to her little 30ns she started
forward \n her chair.
Recovering her composure somewhat,
she whispered uudihly to her attorneys,
"That" is absolutely false, every bit
of it."
Tagrgart will 'take, the stand in . his
own behalf next week. Mrs. Taggart
will also testify.

*Tp HAT'S what you'll save if you buy that piano right
-* : % now at this Clearance Sale.
Figure it out for yourself. The average reduction in
price on every piano in the store is $ioo. . For example,
you can get a $300 piano for #200, a $400 piano for $300
and so forth.
We sell these pianos for $6.00 down and $6.00 a .
month v Now divide $6.00 (the amount of one payment)
into $100 (the amount you save on the price of the in-
strument) and the answer is 16 and a fraction. So you see
we actually save you 16 payments. This means the piano
is paid for a year and a third quicker than if you bought:
the instrument at its x regular price.
The big reduction in price, the easy terms, our liberal
guarantee and the reliability of the piano will certainly
induce you to buy here â the only place where you can
get such advantages.

The Aetna Indemnity Company yes
terday filed with Auditor Baehr a no
tice that it desires to withdraw as
surety on the offlcia^bond of Frank A.
Maestretti, Commissioner of . Public
Works, and to be relieved from all lia
bility thereon hereinafter arising.
The company ascribes as Its reason
for withdrawing from'Maestretti's bond
that it fears it will sustain loss if it
remains longer thereon.
Auditor Baehr sent notification to
Maestretti that he must file a new of
ficial bond in the sum of $25,000 within
ten days of the date of the filing of the
notice of withdrawal by the Aetna
Company.
This makes the second company that
has withdrawn from Maestretti's bond,
the United States. Fidelity and Guar
anty Company having done so last
year. Maestretti will find it difficult to
secure a surety company to go on his
bond and may have to obtain personal
sureties. " The fact that the Commis
sioners of Works are held by the courts
to be individually responsible for ac
cidents due to defective streets and
sidewalks is the real cause of the

ocean, while 4hat part lying to the
east of the cemeteries along the hills
discloses the beauties of the valley ly
ing to the westward.
It is surprising, that this road can be
built on light grades and therefore de
voted to all classes of vehicles, and
those who for years have been deprived
of the pleasure of driving in the
suburbs of San Francisco, with the ex
ception of Golden Gate Park, when this
roud is an accomplished fact, will have
a boulevard which no lover of horses
has ever contemplated.
There has been a misapprehension to
the effect that the boulevard is intended
for automobiles. This Is not so. It is
intended for all pleasure vehicles, and
under the deed of the Spring Valley
Company granting the right of. way
through its property is to bo devoted
to this purpose, heavy teaming only
being prohibited. '
It Is the intention of those who are
working on this boulevard to obtain
$100 subscriptions from 350 public spir
ited citizens of this community, making
a total of $35,000, the amount required
to build this' boulevard. It Is difficult
for them to reach all those who cannot
fail to recognize the untold advantages
to a city "of this size through having
such a boulevard, and this means is
taken to bri::g the subject to their at
tention so they may have the oppor
tunity of giying the assistance required.
The list below shows the names of
those who have subscribed and the
amount of the subscriptions. The
money is now deposited In banks of San
Francisco. The Spring Valley Company
as well as the South San Francisco
Land and Improvement Company and
the Crocker Estate Company have very
generously donated this land for a
right of way through their respective
properties for this boulevard.
It Is doubtful whether the publlo
spirited people of San Francisco fully
realize the movement on foot that Is
depicted In the chart above in regard to
the construction of a pleasure boule
vard, which Is a continuation of Nine
teenth avenue boulevard from the Park
through Ocean avenue and the Spring
Valley lands to Grand avenue. South
San Francisco.
The heavy line of the chart shows
this boulevard, that portion lying to
the â¢west of the railroad giving a beau

I A. B. SmitP) Company ICharles Glalgren pestered Special Po*
liceman Neill, in Hale Brothers' store,
until the officer was obliged in self-pro
tection to place him under arrest. With
out any provocation whatever, Mr.
Glalgren informed the policeman that
he had no use for him other than to
batter him, and also expressed yearning
desire to commit such battery. Thus
threatening, he followed the object of
his detestation all over the big depart
ment store. When arraigned before
Judge Fritz he offered no defense, so a
fine of 55 was imposed.
sister, who is married to Mr. Brusedon's
son, but he got tired of her and she had
to quit. Then he hired me, and ever
since I went to work for him Miss Gelli
and her sister and brother-in-law have
been putting up jobs on me. This is the
third time they have had me arrested
on false charges. I suppose they think
that if Mr. Brusedon fires me his daugh
ter-in-law will get the job."
Miss Gelli laughed to scorn the de
fendant's allegation of conspiracy and
reaffirmed that the dog biscuits had
been hurled at her with intent to annoy.
Her sister and brother-in-law also as
serted that Mrs. Mann systematically
persecuted them. Then the Judge pro
nounced Mrs. Mann guilty and ordered
her to reappear for sentence to-morrow.
The Dempseys dwell at 440% Second
street, and â¢when John's young sweet-
Jieart came from Ireland two years ago
end married him the household was
very happy, for he was n Industrious
"Dempsey, I'm glad to see you re
pentant and ashamed, and if you swear
to abstain from Intoxication for one
year I'll let you go home."
The proposal was accepted with
alacrity. Mr. Dempsey, accompanied by
a bailiff, went to St. Mary's Church and
had one of the Paulist Fathers ad
minister the oath of abstinence. Then
he returned to the court and was dis
missed.
â¢ When stalwart John Dempsey stood
up to receive sentence he shed tears
of contrition, his pretty little wife
sobbed, his gray-haired mother hid her
emotion behind a withered hand, and
bis chubby babe wailed. The lachrymal
display saved Mr. Dempsey from the
six months' imprisonment which Judge
Fritz had promised him, for his Honor
e&Jd:
Miss Emma Wilson waa fighting the
ptano and Miss Ruby Wilson, Miss Mary
O'Connor and Mr. Louis Murphy were
heartily enjoying the combat when Pa
trolman G. C. Badenhauer burst into
the apartment and arrested the quartet
for violating the ordinance which pro
hibits the making of music or any
thing savoring of It between the hours
of 1 and 6 a. m. in a place where liquors
are sold. The scene of the capture
was the Universal Saloon, close to
Golden Gate Park.
Aa interesting development of the
ca.se wts the incarceration of George
Fisher, owner of the saloon, when he
visited the Central police station to
obtain the release on bail of the four
prisoners. They were let out, but he
\u25a0was booked for drunkenness and locked
up. Judge Conlan will hear both cases
to-morrow.
It was on the last anniversary of this
nation's natal day that Mr. Hartmann
made his alleged murderous attack on
ilies Clark. On that day. the lady
averred, he brought to her home, on
the 2200 block of Beach street, and near
to the Presidio, a pair of her shoes,
which he had repaired. She approved
his workmanship and promptly paid
for It, and then, her naturally hos
pitable spirit being enhanced by the
patriotic significance of the day, 6he
invited him to join her and Mrs. Rice,
one of her numerous white lady friends,
at a little dinner which she was giving:,
end he gladly accepted the invitation.
Testimony conflicts as to what hap
pened at the table. Miss Clark declares
that Mr. Hartmann was fired to anger
by Mrs. Rice's expressed opinion that
the Fourth of July was the most glori
ous day on the Christian calendar and
ttiat in every desirable Quality the
United States 6tood head and shoulders
over any other nation, Germany not
excepted.
"Den." Miss Clark testified before
Police Judge Conlan, "de man's condick
became uttahly scandalashious. His
langwich wuz mos" "tensive, en. w'en
Ah. beln* de lady of Cc house, pehlitely
jieked him ten be kaihful wif his wuds
he ups wif de fawk en plunges et inteh
raah back, right slam 'tween man
shouldahs. En raah agony Ah squawk
ed fo* hep, en den he outs wif his gun
en kimmences teh blazÂ© away at me."
At this point of her testimony MiE3
Clark warmly told the Judge that not
another word would she utter in that
court if those present were not re
strained from laughing at what she
said. The remainder of her story,
however, was largely composed of repe
tition.
Mr. Hartmann absolutely denied the
allegation of stabbing, scouted the ac
cusation of shooting as absurd, inas
much as he had never possessed a
pistol, and declared that Mis=s Clark did
fire several shots at him as he fled from
her house, leaping fences as he ran.
In so far from having taken umbrage
at any patriotic sentiment ventilated
at the* table, he was applausive of all
that was said in laudation of Uncle
Sam.
"Then, what started the fight?" in-
Quired the bench.
"Ach. esk me?" answered Mr. Hart
nrann. "Efter invitationin* me ter

lady frent she der aboosif lengvitch

telldyness. Der vile names she calls
ad me und dor gun she pools und
ehoods ad me, und I runs und der es
cabe I makes."
"Ah lost man gun befo* Ah eber seed
>eh." Miss Clark contradicted.
Further inquiry developed the fact
that Miss Clark is noted for truculence
of spirit and has posed In the police
courts on more than one occasion as a
defendant accused of murderous as
sault, her last appearance in that role
having been about six months ago,
when she was charged with having
battered the head of a Caucasian neigh
bor with a baseball bat_ Her record
was contributive to the causes of Mr.
Hartmann's dismissal, the court appar
ently opining that Miss Clark had ef
fected his arrest in order to weaken
any formal charge of violence which
â¢he might have contemplated filing
\u25a0 against her.
â¢was owins to bis defective marksman
ship, as there could be no question as
to his intent-
Miss Jemette Clark, tbon of hue and
buxom of form, swore most positively
that Jacob Hartmann, a ahoemaker of
Teutonic nativity, did not only stab
her in the back with a two-pronged
table fork, but that Immediately after
the stabbing he whipped from one* of
his pockets a revolver and fired bul
lets therefrom until the weapon was
empty. she being the target. The
shooting was at three yards' range, she
added, and her escape from perforation
"Before I became Mr. Brusedon's
housekeeper," Mrs. Mann responded,
"the position was filled by Miss Gelli'a
Mrs. Maggie Mann, accused of having
disturbed the peace by chucking dog
biscuits at Miss Adeline Gelli of 3 Kent
street and requesting her to eat* them,
declared she was a victim of conspiracy
to oust her from her position as house
keeper for John Brusedon, whose domi
cile is on Mason street, near Union. She
denied, also, that the dog biscuits which
she chucked from a window of the
Brusedon residence were aimed at Miss
Gelli, or that she said they were appro
priate food for that lady.
"Explain the conspiracy which you
allege?" said Judge Conlan.
When the corps of official interpreters
had confessed inability to make intell
gible to Judge Fritz the language which
the putative Hungarian was vociferous
ly exploding, his Honor also exhausted
his linguistic repertoire in the same in
vestment, then told the witness to re
tire. Persons acquainted with the pro
vincial dialects of Hungary may learn
of something to their advantage by ap
plying to the magistrate presiding In
Department Xo. 3.
"Dempsey, you are undeserving of
such a helpmeet." said the Judge, "be
cause you are unappreciatlve of her
worth, if you are ever brought before
me again for ill treating her I will not
allow tears to Influence me."
If he were sent to prison, she inform
ed the court, she would work until she
could accumulate enough money to pay
passage for herself and infant to Ire
land, where her parents' home is always
open to her. Better that, she thought,
than to ruin her life and that of the lit
tle one by remaining at the mercy of a
worthless drunkard. \u25a0
"On my knees I begged him to stop
drinking," the wife told the Judge, "but
some evil influence possessed him, and
neither his mother nor I could remove
It."

and his bride was very helpful to his
mother in making his home life com

his earnings for drink and otherwise

The bank statement showed all ''of

been expected. It is sufficient, how
ever, to cross by a margainof a couple

gan a temporary reign of terror in the
lower East . Side to-day by' raiding and
smashing windows in stores within halt
a block of police headquarters In Mul
berry street, and ended by beating a man
so badly that he may not recover. With
plate-glass windows crashing first on one
side and then on the other in the vicin

fifty angry, policemen tried in vain to
catch the elusive rioters. A coffee-house
was next raided, the gang's only object
being to smash up the dishes, which was
done after the waiters had been thrown
into the street. The police 'were hot on
the trail of the toughs by this time, and
were just in time to rescue Christo Colo
janes, a Greek,, after his face had been
lacerated and two ribs broken. The gang
was robbing him of pennies and nickels.
Only one member of the party was ar

NOTORIOUS EOUGHS
OUT ON WILD EAID
Three years ago Garland suggested
to President Roosevelt that the entire
White River Plateau should be created
into a great national park and to-day
he said that, after another visit to this
region, his conviction was intensified.
"The limits of the park," he said,
"should be practically those of the
present forest reserve; in fact, its out
line is magnificently suggested by
great walls of rock. It is, in fact, a
vast tableland lifted from 9000 to 12,000
feet above the sea, with protecting
cliffs a thousand feet high on either
side. It possesses every beauty which
a camper, a lover of nature, could de
sire."
"I have just returned from a trip to
the west of Gray Peak and I am ap
palled at the desolation of. this region.
Carelessness and greed *nave stripped
the forests from, the hills, so that little
remains to check the spring freshets.
"This trip has convinced me of the
necessity of making the crest of the
Rocky Mountains one vast forest re
serve. Every mountain crest from an
altitude of 8500 feet should be so re
served and held forever under the
Jurisdiction of the National Govern
ment, for the reason that, the farmers
of the neighboring States, as well as
those of the immediate vicinity, are
vitally concerned."

shots after two robbers who had stolen
goods valued at $2500 from a baggage car j

wrist; Morris T. Cohen, shot In the leg;,
Mrs. Cohen, ear Bhot off.
The robbers loaded the booty on a wag

Foreman Andrews addressed three sep
erate letters to Registrar Adams Indos-
Uig the unlawfully registered names of
voters and asking that they be stricken
from the rolls.
The subjoined! list Includes the patient*
at the City and County Hospital who, ac
cording to the opinion of District Attor
ney Byington, are not legal voters, and
those so-called employes and patienu
whose names are on the register but
whose presence at the hospital could not
be discovered by the Grand Jury expert
who locked for them.

The following report gives some light
as to methods in vogue as to registra
tion from the hospitals:
Michael Xer.eberâ The receiving clerk cays
he is not there; the chler orderly says he 1b
working there; his name does not appear on
the pay roll for the month of July. 1905.

he if not there; tie chief orderly says Dan
Ryan works tii^re; Daniel Ryan appears on the
fay roll y.s mattress rnakere aseitiant; salary
for the month of July. 1905. f5. It is impossi
ble to determine lf Daniel Ryan and H. J.
Ryan it one and vbe same person. It Is doubt
ful.
Tbotaas Sullivan â The receiving clerk says
he !Â»-r.ot -there; thÂ« chier orderly fays he is

Guisoppe Brpsa â This man !s there and stated
when imervietvea that he had t*-<Â»n there about
fc-ur years and that he would leave when he
got better.
Ar.vbony Bennett Conroy â This man is there

April. UOS. He says that he will leave as soon
as h<> recovers.
William Henry Devlin â This man is there;

July. 1905. salary *'Â»<*â¢ I* i g impossible to dfc
tensrfae i' B. W. Clark and William Clark are
or-t and the same person.
Raymond Hurley dt Niteâ The receiving
Registration frauds of considerable ex
tent have been uncovered by the Grand
Jury, and a rejvert of the names of those
illegally enrolled has been turned over to
Registrar George P. Adams by Foreman
Andrews. This investigation is a partial
one, covering only the places in San
FVancisco where special attention was
called to the conditions. Foreman An
drews says that he believes that a thor
ough Investigation of all the registered
caznes of this city would reveal frauds
far more startling than those which he
exposes.
The work of the Grand Jury covers the
City and County Hospital, the Alms
house, several hotels and apartment
houses and the officers of election. The
tctal registration at the City and County
Hospital is I*3. Of these twenty-eight are
not to be found there and twenty-five are
employes who have not yet been dlsoov
ered by the experts.
According to the opinion given to the
Grand Jury by District Attorney Bying
ton yesterday none of these patients aX
the hospital are legally registered, be
cause their residence is only temporary-
Of the ESS names on the register at the
Almshoiise fifty-one are found to have
moved away and fourteen axe dead. Yet
their names appeared, evidently regis
tered by 6ome one. The Grand Jury also
plates that many legally registered are
Incapable of judgment.
Thirty-nine illegal registrations were
found In hotels. Twenty-one officers of
election art not on the assessment rolls
ajr.i are therefore ineligible to serve.
Tti6 Grand Jury has issued a number
of badges which will be distributed to
bona 2<Je ritiiens who wish to watch the
booths and are not on the list of officials.

who in private life was Mrs. Allen

now playing at the Third-avenue The

Rev. C. K. Jenness, who has been
active in negotiating: the project on the
part of the Methodists, has been pastor
of the local church for six years. Pre
vious to that he was a professor In
Stanford University, where' he had
graduated with honors. To his good

the Presbyterian church of Berkeley
have voted to sell their property at the

The Methodists have contemplated
building a modern SCO.OOO house of wor
ship, which in design would have far
surpassed any in the city, and were in
process of letting the contract when the
trustees of the frecbyterlan church of
fered their edifice for sale. Immediate
ly negotiations were opened by the two
corporations and resulted In an agree
ment whereby the Presbyterian trus
tees would relinquish their holdings for
the sum of $:.':!,:> (Hi.
The reasons assigned by the Presby
terians in moving from their present
quarters is that the majority of their
congregation reside in the northeastern
part of the city ar.d it would be benefi
cial to them to move the church toward
the outskirts of the town, where it
\u25a0would be more accessible to its people.
The Methodists have been collecting
subscriptions for the past three years
and were negotiating with contractors
toward buiiding on their present prop
erty, but it became apparent that the
business center would approach their
doors. Some uneasiness was felt and
they were looking for a more desirable
location.
The new corporation was organized
primarily for the purpose of construct
ing the Griffiths street railroad, for
which a franchise was secured on vari
ous streets some time ago. The capital
stock is $250,000, divided into shares of
$100 each, of which $500 ha 3 been sub
scribed. It is said that the company is
backed with plenty of capital ami that
those who nre goinsr to finance the en

NEW YORK, Aug. 5. â Joseph Cowan
of Dallas, Texas, dropped in on Xew

ting into motion a claim made some

Andrew Hartstleld for a large parcel of
vuluabl* real estate. It is declared by
theso persons Hartsfieid owned all that
section of the city lying west of Fifth
avenue, between Seventy-fifth and One
Hundred and Thirty-fifth streets, part
of which is now Central ParK. This
tract, embracing ICO acres, is worth
much more than $400,000,000, says
Cowan, who appraises it at more than a
billion dollars, but is willing to settle
on a reasonable cash \u25a0 basis. It is said,
with the present reputed owners.
The Kartsneld or Hatneld claim is not
a new one, but the heirs have now got
together ar.d, according to Cowan, pro
pose, to take active steps toward assert
ing: their rights. Cowan first came to
New York last November and placed
the claim before the Controller and the
City Chamberlain.
When his claim .was questioned the
lawyer said he would .go to the Regis
ter's office and procure the volume of
the records wlicrein is recorded the
lease to the city of Andrew Hartsfield's
160 acres for ninety-nine years and a
day, beginning with the year 1795.
Cowan did not find the record. He now
asserts that Â«\u25a0 certain individual, who Is
known to him. surreptitiously purloined
one of the record books containing a
copy of the lease. It is now hl3 inten
tion to apply to the courts to compel
the custodian of the record to produce
it in court.

It was claimed, could go on indefinitely.
As a way out of the dilemma a resort to
local option was recommended, but It met

should be raissd to at least 120 and there

versity ot California in its task ot es
tablishing a university farm. Professor
Bailey has had large experience in ag
ricultural education, nature study and
subjects that are related indirectly to
t!:ese branches. He was formerly as
sistant to Asa Gray, the great botanist
at Coinell. .and for many years has
been at the head of Cornell's agricul
tural department. Incidentally he edit-}

"Tlie ; idea of a "model university

Bailey last night as decidedly imprac

A university farm, declared th-i
speaker, to accomplish the most good
and .serve the State, ar.d particularly
the agricultural interests, should be re
;;*rded as an agricultural workshop
fur students. If it is desirable to pull
up or; plow- i:i a crop of turnips to
demonstrate to f-tudents how good tur
liips Should be raised, then the plowing
in cr pullinK up should be done, said
Mr. Bailey. 3nd if that is done, where

"You canjsee and judge for yourselves
as to lha erasures. Of course, 1 <annot
tell when they were made, but when the
bills began to run up I began an investi
gation, and the various county oflicers
pointed out the erasures and dented that
they had ordered or received the goods
they are charged with. For instance, the
County Superintendent of Schools does
not use paste by the quart. He tells me
he occasionally buys a small tube or two,
yet he has been charzed with half-dozens
and dozens, with but himself and two
deputies to use it all.
"The County Surveyor said to me:
â¢What would 1 do with all the pens I am
charged with, or the penholders? \Vhy, I
don't use one once a month.' lie is
charged up with dozens of them. There is
no accounting for it unlesa you charge
some one with being crooked. I am tak
ing thtse bills- home with me and will
have them done by Monday. By that
time 1 will have cut them down about
$1000 and the Board of Supervisors will
pass on them."
The County Assessor's own bills are
enormous, arid Expert Sabin says they
will be- cut down $500 or $W
In an interview with the Finance Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors
Chief Deputy Tom Robinson, under
Dalton, is quoted as having pointed out
sonic $500 -worth of \u25a0material on the As
sessor's bills Lhat was never received
at the office. He, however, qualifies
this by saying that if it. was, received
he docs not know it.
The man who made out all the bills
| Is Otto L. Hasse, the manager of. the
'Central News Agency. 'He was repre
senting Mrs. I,ottie M. Clasbey of Salt
I Lake City, and when she came out here
to see how her store was getting on
she found outstanding' bills .to the
! amount of $5000 and the accounts in
such a shape that she discharged Hasse.
Assessor- Dalton this afternoon gave
out a statement denying every charge
reflecting on him and inviting full in
vestigation of his conduct.
Otto Hasse has made a written-state
ment that Dalton bought nothing from
the Central News Company on credit,
corroborating Dalton's position and
contentions. ;
The Sheriff, and {he County Superin
tendent of Schools have been cha:ged
with dozens of bottles of ink which they
say they have never received. In this
way the bills for stationery in trie various
county oftices have bsen increased until
they have been averaging over $U)0 a
month, whereas they ordinarily should
be about $250.
Expert Sabin said to-day: .
OAKLAND. Aug. s.â Further investiga
tions were made to-day of the charge
that Assessor Henry P. Dalton and oth
ers have stuffed official stationery ac
counts for private advantage.
Statements made to Expert John Sabin
by County Surveyor Prather, County Su
perintendent of. Schools T. O. Crawford,
Sheriff Barnet and others are to the ef
fect that false entries of items have been
put on their bills.

Mrs. Angelo Delbos, convicted of
grand larceny ,y a jury in Judge
Dunne's court, was sentenced yesterday
to serve two years in San Quentin. On
December 12, 1902, she obtained $500
from Mrs. Maria Marquet, a,, relative,
on the representation that she could
purchase a lodging-house on Howard
street for that amount. It was, later
ascertained that she only paid $100 for
the lodging-house and. kept the $400.
The case was a peculiar one: Mrs.
Dslbos was originally arrested for
felony embezzlement. _ An application
was made for a writ of labeas corpus
for her release on the ground that the
charge should have been grand lar
ceny. Judge Cook granted the writ and
she was discharged. She was promptly
arrested on - charge of grand larceny
and was tried and convicted in Judge,
Dunne's court. , An appeal was taken
to the Supreme Court on the ground
that the charge should have been em
bezzlement and the appeal was sus-'
tamed. The District Attorney obtained
a rehearing and the Supreme Court re
versed itself ny affirming , the judg
ment of the lower court, but granting
the defendant a new trial on other
grounds.

Wheatland and Highland Springs in
which several Sun Francisco people re
ceived Injuries.
A3 the stage was nearing- Highland

The Board of Education met In se
cret conference yesterday and agreed
on a new course of study for the next
school term, ',vhich ' opens on Monday,
August 14. .
The course, which will be formally
adopted this week, is the same as that
of last year with a few unimportant
changes, and to meet the demands ne
cessitated by tho adoption of the new
State readers, which will be used in.
the schools from now on.
A new departure was the adoption
by the board of the study course for
the evening 1 schools, which heretoforu
have had no course. The' studies have
been apportioned to the various clrvsses
substantially as they have been taught
In the past.
The board also decided to purchase
the supplementary books needed \u25a0 for
the next school term to the amount of
$2000, for which provision was made
in the budget.
Principal C. W. Mark of the Crocker
Grammar School and Special Inspector
Frank McShe'ehy were busy yesterday
endeavoring to pet quarters â¢ for â¢ the
pupils pending the building 1 of thft ad
ditions to the building. They hope to
rent a larse building, designed for a
market, on Oak street, near Devisa
dero. in which six rooms may be fit
ted up. Then there are two vacant
stores on Devinadero street, -between
Oak and Pagre, which may be rented
for the purpose, and an attempt will
bo made to sret Devisadero Hall, and
sufficient accommodations will be thus
obtained for the pupils for six months.'
! Through an oversight, it is said, the
J people on the lighters were not notified
1 that the ship was about to move. As the
j liner forged ahead many of the lighters
j capsized and their occupants were thrown
i Into the water. . The current causefl by
! the whirling propellers dragged the
j brown bodies under the liner's stern and
j round and round' among viÂ© struggling
Japanese churned the death-dealing
: screws.
I The Bcreams of thÂ» coolies alarmed the
j whole harbor, and soon a big fleet of
1 Email boats was engaged in the work of
! rescue. Six* bodies were recovered. One
iof them, that of a woman, was. legless,
! the propeller's blade having amputated
i both limbs. . . â¢ . ' â¢ .
About sixty are said to have been In
jured. < The Minnesota was held until Cap
tain Rlnder put up a heavy bond, and
'\u25a0 when the Siberia left Nagasaki .the Japa
nese authorities were still investigating
the tragedy.
[ According to advices . received by the
j liner Siberia the \u25a0 Great Northern's big
steamship Minnesota during her last visit
j to Xagasaki was responsible for a terri
ble tragedy, in which six Japanese, sev
eral of them women, lost their lives and
about three score coolies sustained more
or less serious Injuries. J ;
After leaving the drydock the Minne
j sota was moored to one of the buoys in
the harbor, lighters were made fast
alongside the liner and "Japanese men
and women were soon busy passing bask
ets of coal from the lighters to the Min
nesota's bunker . chutes. The lighters,
Beveral rows deep, lined both sides of the
1 b}g ship, and on the-iighters and on plat
forms suspended over the Minnesota's
sides hundreds of brown men and women
wero soon engrossed In the sweltering
task of coaling the liner.
When the activity was at its height the
harbor master cams on board and asked
for Captain Hinder. He was shown to
the commander's cabin.
"You must move your ship at once to
that other buoy," v waa the message the
j official delivered.
In Japan when a Government official
I says "move" it means "move," and Cap
tain Rlnder, anxious to oblige, hastened
to comply with the request.
Mounting the bridge. Kinder turned the
engine-room telegraph to "stand by."
"Let go forward," he bellowed through'
the megaphone, and In a few minutes the
big liner was adrift.
"Full speed ahead," rang the engine
! room telegraph,. The huge propellers
1 thrashed the water and the leviathan
i shot forward.

INQUEST IS DRAMATIC.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 5. â When young
Thomas W. Cook staggered into his
home with a broken skull, bleeding and
mortally wounded, after he had been
beaten and robbed on the night of July
22, he exclaimed to his terrified sister,
"Teddy, what's the matter? Don't you
see the death man?"
Such was the bereaved sister's testi
mony at the inquest here to-day.
When S. G. Pembroke, father of one
of the self-confessed murderers of
Cook, beheld the skull of his son's vic
tim as it was exhibited to the Coroner's
jury, he gasped, rushed into the street
and fainted. â¢ \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0
The testimony of the vlotim's sister
and the collapse of the father of one
of the accused murderers were the dra
matic incidents of a remarkable hear

< George Blaker, John Schneider and

J with murder. The following Is the

"We, the jury, do find that the name
of the deceased was Thomas W. Cook,
a native of Nova Scotia, aged about 23
years, that he came to his death at the

find that his death was caused by

A few weeks later Crowhurst gave
Miss Quigley a handsome feather boa,

would warrant the expenditure of such

presents, became suspicious that all

about it.
Crowhurst became enraged at wnat
he termed the girl's needless curiosity,
and the result was a quarrel which ter
minated the engagement. This hap

that date she returned the ring to him,

VLAMEDA GIRL WHO DROKE HER ENGAGEMENT TO JAMES CROWHURST
BEciuPE OF HIS SUSPICIOUS AFFLUENCE, AND A SISTER OF THE MUR
DERED GROCER. THOMAS COOK.
RENO, Aug. 3.â William V.'. Stephen
son, who was shot and killed by Chil
lion Bowen in a room at San Fran
cisco this morning, was well known in,
Reno, having resided in the county
with his family for a number of years.
He owned a ranch at Washoe, a small
town south of here. Bowen had leased
a tract of land near by. though he is
not well known in the county. . f
This week Stephenson, without in
forming any one. also departed for the
bay. It is thought he had heard of the
relations of Bowen and his wife. The
dead man leaves several children, all
of whom are now in the care of friends
here. Both Stephenson and his wife
have hitherto borne excellent reputa
tions and the story that Stephenson
had previously killed two men is not
believed.

to be kept In Ignorance of this, but I
can't face them after the murder.
What can I do? They will always look
on me as the cause of their being
fatherless. I love them, but not the
gather, xt is best that Will was killed
instead of Chillion. for we could never
have lived together after that, any
way."
As a result of the tragedy four chil
dren are left fatherless on the Nevada
ranch and without the care of a moth
er, whose shame will follow on into the
future lives of these little ones. The
children are Gertrude, 7 years; Edgar.
6 years; Hattie, 4 years, and Orvia, 3
years of age.

here for, -because ; I ; - did not do any-;
thins wrong besides living with a man
I * loved.'?: I j don't; know- who is caring
t or ' my' children.: It ' la \u25a0 best for them
Mrs. â¢ Stephenson gave the following
version of her relations with the mur
derer: "I always felt that after Bowen
came into my life there would be no
happiness with my, husband, and he
knew it. ; Chillion and I were fitted for
each other and I went with him about
the country. This was my first visit
to San Francisco and I. had never been
out of Nevada ; before, so wanted my
only love to accompany me. Will asked
me to let him come," but I refused. We
were in that room yesterday when Will
came, and I knew that he was after me.
If; was up . to " ChilUon to shoot or he"
would .have been; killed,; for -that was
the first time, my husband hiad 7 caught
us "together,, although^'he suspected it
before.. * ; ' \u25a0 / '.
'.'She said she loved me and not her
husband, so .when she was sick I volun
teered to bring her to San Francisco.
Later we went to the room. on Larkin
street under^ the name of Robert Wil
son and wife.
"Will came to the room this morn
ing and rapped. yLucy and I were In
bed, so I got. up arid got my gun from
a dresser drawer. , ' Open the door/ said
Stephenson, but -"I refused. He broke
in and I ; shot him." It was in self-de
fense, and: that will be rhy plea if I am
tried for this." ' â¢
â¢"Soon- the neighbors became talka
tive, so on my return from a trip to
Virginia City one day Stepheneson or
dered me to leave the ranch. I bor
rowed his team and took my things to
my own ranch, but I worked in -the
vicinity for a short time, correspond
ing with Mrs. Stepheijson, no matter
where I was.
Compromising, and ardent letters
from Mrs. Stephenson to Bowen were
found in his possession. One letter
contained . this expression: "Don't
worry, for you are the one any woman
could love all her life and be mo*t
happy with. I will not give you up,
love, as long as there Is life, but when
I am dead you may know that you have
my blessing. I am your true love."
In another letter to Bowen the
woman wrote: "May the curse of God
come on that man who keeps me from
you," and on the same day she penned
this missive to Bowen Mrs. Stephenson
addressed a seemingly loving note to
her husband In Nevada.
Bowen was at ease yesterday In the
City Prison and talked freely of the
shooting. He was kept apart from the
woman. His statement of the affair
was in part as follows:
"It was while I was digging a well
arid erecting buildings that I met
Stephenson. He Invited me to stop at
his house .until I was settled. I was
boarding there about four months and
became friendly with Mrs. Stephenson
through talking about her relations
with her husband, I having observed
that they did not agree on occasions.
She told me they were not mated, and
soon I found that we loved each other.
Frequently expressions of our love were
made, and it was suggested that we
leave the ranch and marry.

Sheriff Barnet gave a synopsis of the
confessions L made by Schneider and
Blaker. John MacDougald, Everett
Loveland and Leslie Bradley, boys, tes
tified - that they had seen blaker,
Schneider and Pembroke slttingon the
opposite side of the street from Cook's
store about 9 o'clock on the night of
the robbery. ' Others who gave testi
mony were Alexander Shields, "who

Daniel Crosby, --Dr. J. M. Shannon, C. H.
Cruff and Constable Tom Carroll. â¢
B. Mehrman, assisted by Deputy Dis
trict Attorney W. H. L. Hynes and
Sheriff Frank Rarnet.
Mrs. Edna Cook Harper, sister of the
murdered man, related how her brother
entered, their home after his encounter
with the footpads. She said: "Tom
came into the house through the front
door about twenty minutes to 10 on
the night he was beaten. He staggered
hatless into the dining-room, where I
was alone. His face was, covered with
blood and I could see a gaping cut on
his head. Ho said, 'Teddy,' what's the
matter. Don't go see the death man?'
"Teddy is a pet name he used to call
me. He staggered in the room and
spoke in a rambling way about money,
feeling his back pockets as he did so.
He said he had been robbed. I asked
him who did 'it. He tried to answer, but
could not. If stepped to the telephone
to summon the doctor, but Tom would
not let me. Then I ran from the house
and screamed' for help. Tom had a few
pieces of silver in his pocket when he
came Into the house and his gold .watch,
which he placed upon the table. I was
at the hospital when my brother was
conscious and saw him hold up three
fingers when I asked him how many
persons had beaten him." . v
t>r. J. H. Callen told of how Cook had
repeated the word "pipe" and tapped
his head^ with his hand. When the
doctor asked him if he had been hit
with a pipe he answered "yes." When
asked if the persons who attacked him
were men Cook replied "no" arid when
ask*d if they were boys the patient
answered "yes." He also said that there
were- three .boys, said that he -knew
them and that George Blaker and John
Schneider were two of the trio. ' Dr.
Callen Asserted that the believed Cook's
mind was clear when he answered the
questions.
J. H. Kleupfer testified that he had
seen Blaker and Schneider coming
through a hole in an orchard fence in
Fruitvale about 5 o'clock on the even
ing of the date of the holdup. Kleupfer
said Blaker had a piece of iron pipe in
his hand. One of the boys threw an
apricot that hit the witness in the face,
but Kleupfer said none of them spoke
to him.
About the middle of July the fact
that Mrs. Stephenson was in need of
surgical attendance suggested to her
self and, husband a trip to this city,
upon whloh he was to accompany her.
Lack of funds, however, prevented him
from carrying out their original plans,
and on July 15 the wife started for San
Francisco alone.
It was hut a few days later that
Stephenson learned that his wife, by
prearrangement, had met Bowen at
Reno and that they, in company with
Mrs. Clara Brown and a young son,
had proceeded on to \ San Francisco,
where they had secured apartments at
the United States Hotel. The day after
their arrival Mrs. Brown went to Oak
land and Mrs. Stephenson entered St.
Winifred's Hospital to undergo an
operation. -\
Leaving, the hospital last Wednesday
Mrs. Stephenson accompanied Bowen to
the lodging-house on Larkin * street,
where' Bowen introduced himself and
companion to the landlady, Mrs. F.
Beck, as man and wife. . How Stephen
son managed to trace his wife and
Bowen so readily to their new abode
is a' secret that the murdered man will
probably carry to the grave. The fact
that his wife and Bowen had come to
San Francisco together aroused his de
termination to follow them hither. He
immediately arranged for the care of
his children at the ranch and finally
succeeding in borrowing sufficient
funds to make the trip and meet
expense of his wife's treatment at the
hospital he started on what has proved
a fateful trip. Arriving here late Fri
day, the husband proceeded to satisfy
himself as to the location of his wife
and Bowen and at 7:30 o'clock yester
day! morning he quietly entered the
Lurkin-stroet house . and hurriedly
climbed the stairs to the third floor.
where\ Bowen -and the woman ( were
sleeping, .v \u25a0'[ ; . >
Apparently the occupants of the room
had some misgivings of the dangerthat
awaited' them, - for .when Stephenson
rapped ntt,he door/of the roonvÃowen
answered with a/ "Hello!" "Let me in,"
shouted back; Stephenson. ' ,
Mrs. Stephenson recognized her hus
band's voice/and called to him, "Just a
minute, Will." : -â¢â¢' ;

door, /and : getting his .revolver had
awaited- the appearance of the man
At first he was loth to give credence
to the stories. One day, however, when
Bowen returned to the house from a
visit to Virginia, City, Stephenson met
him and demanded that he'find'quar
ters elsewhere and thereafter leave
his wife, alone. It had become known
to Stephenson that his wife and Bowen
had been together on frequent trips to
Reno and Virginia City, where they
seemingly made no attempt to conceal
their relations.
FOLJiOWS FLEEING COUPLE.
The murder of Stephenson yesterday
was the culmination .of an, affair that
had been the. ftf.lk of Washoe- lor t so v-'
eral months and had provoked much
sympathy in the little town for* the in
jured husband. ThÂ« man now in prison
for the killing of his former friend and
the woman who deserted her husband
for him coolly admitted yesterday that
(their relations "had been such as to ex
cite the criticism of , their townspeople,
and letters found on their persons con
tain confessions of their shameful in
trigue against the dead man.
Last 'December the Stephensons in
vited Bowen to make his home at their
house until ho could be' more comfort
ably settled on his own ranch near by.
At that time he wns boring a well in
the neighborhood, and promptly ac
cepted shelter under the Stephenson
roof. It was not long after. that neigh
bors began to remark the attentions
Bowen was showing Mrs. Stephenson,
and stories of his wife's friendliness
for Tiowcn finally reached the hus
band's ears.
A few minutes after the shooting Po
lice Officer. \u25a0M. J. O'Sullivan, who had
been attracted to the house by the shots,
found Bowen and Mrs. Stephenson bend
ing over the prostrate form of the mur
dered man: Later Detectives Mulcahey
and Matthewson took Bowen and the
woman to the City Prison, where Bowen
was booked for murder and "Mrs. Ste
phenson was charged with being an ac
complice.
FATAIi EXDOF INTRIGUE.
With his love still strong for a shame
less wife, who had borne him four chil
dren and then betrayed his confidence
for the attentions of one Chileon Bowen,
William W. Stephenson, a rancher of
Washoe, Nev., yesterday traced the wom
an to a room at 1015^ Larkin street,
where she and her. paramour, a former
friend of the husband, were making their
temporary abode. Satisfied that his worst
suspicions had been confirmed, the hus
band rapped for admittance to the room'
in which Bowen and Mrs. Lucy Stephen
son were. sheltered. A demand that the
door be opened being met with a refusal
from within, Stephenson forced an en
trance, but had barely crossed the thresh
old when a shot from Bowon's revolver
ended the husband's unhappy Irfe.
What might have happened in that
room had Bowen not prepared himself
for a meeting with the injured husband
is only a matter of conjecture, but it is
easy to believe that quite a different
tragedy might have ensued, for Stephen
son, too, was armed and ready to force
his erring wife to leave the man who had
led her astray from her home and little
ones.
C billion Bowen Uses
Revolver When
I rapped.
Then began Ruef's attack on the leaders
of the Republican party. Lovelahd,
Symmes Wheelan, the individual mem
bers of the Grand Jury, in fact all who
have been striving -for a clean city were
in turn pulled to shreds by invective that
replaced argument. District leaders
against whom- there has never been the
breath of suspicion were calumniated.
The -speaker, however, admitted ; that
there were a few honest men on the
League tickets, but that a majority of
the nominees were saloonmen and dive
keepers or r worse, or had been convicted
of malfeasance in office.
The three-hour tirade was drawing near
an end but the audience called for more,
and it was given them. Names were
hurled at thespeakerby the audience and
of each Ruef had? some slighting remark
to make As a bltlngly sarcastic close. to
his speech he said that he and his Mayor
stood for. "equal rights for all and special
privileges '.to; none.'^- _. _ . â -
Among those present>were: Police Com
missioners- 'PohelmU-ird O'Grady, Secre
tary* Boyne. his lieutenants;
School' Director "Alt'mann, ex-Congress
man^ Llyernash, Public Works Commis
sioner Egan, Registrar/Adams, and a host
of lesser employes 1 whose faces are famil
iar at' the City Hali;.and Hall of Justice.
.Ruef wasVthe only, speaker, of ;the even
ing. \u25a0 ,/\u25a0 : : â¢'\u25a0'' \u25a0 -*;".'^ :'.':\u25a0. : -"\u25a0\u25a0 .
nXII.S ATOPPONEXTS.
Regarding the Grand Jury, Ruef had
some caustic remarks to make. "Headed
as It Is," he exclaimed, "by a political
foreman, and composed of so-called po
litical reformers,' it is used as a weapon
over the heads of honest men. Why, on
election day there will be twelve grand
jurymen each wearing a badge, and un
der them ten men to watch the voters.
By virtue of their office they will be al
lowed in the polling : places, and under
this arrangement can intimidate or influ
ence uncertain voters." ,â¢
The speaker denied any connection with
tKe -disgraced attorney, Jack Chretien,
and a great portion of his time was taken
up in explaining, away the many mistakes
of the present administration or in ridi
culing many of the -charges now pending.
He* declared that, the reason for his not
replying to newspaper attacks was owing
to the fact that no paper would print his
reply. -jt - \u25a0 Â»-\u25a0 "/\u25a0\u25a0 '.\u25a0'â¢ â¢- \u25a0â¢\u25a0"
This brought him to the subject of May
or Schmitz and the henchmen in the hall
duly burst forth into cheers. He spoke
eloquently of the Mayor's private life,
which has never been Questioned. He
then accused the Republican League of
being the backer and J arch conspirator In
advancing the Citizens' Alliance, and said
that if the movement was successful the
streets of San Francisco" would flow with
rivers of blood. This, pleased the audi
ence mightily.
ATTACKS GRAND JURY.
There were few interruptions of the
speaker, as any tendency in that direc
tion was quickly suppressed by police
men who stood at the heads of the aisles
and lined the gallery. , The only inter
ruptions were In the form of suggestions
'that Started the speaker on a new tack.
Ruef began his talk with a vicious at
tack on R. A. Crothers and Fremont
Older, proprietors of an afternoon paper.
About one-fourth of the evening was de
voted to them, much to the disgust of
the few that came to listen to campaign
argument. In"addition, he attacked the
editor of a morning paper and included
The Call by innuendo. .-"' .
A denial of many charges
brought against him was entered by the
speaker. He-deniedHhat he was a graft
er in any sense,' 'and gave as his descrip
tion of a grafter "a man who refuses to
be blackmailed." He'then told of hi 3 own
history In San . Francisco, and cast slurs
on the reputations of the fathers of "his;
opponents, at^tfte, same time speaking of'
his own good, honest/bringing up.
Switching, from his attack on the after
noon paper, he spoke -somewhat irrele
vantly of a subsidized- press that em
ployed reporters with eyes at keyholes,
and of the Grand Jury's private sneak
thieves and reporters.. "l will not," con
tinued the speaker, "refer personally to
the reporters present; but those who
should be the guides and mentors of tho
people are Its virulent pestilence." At
this juncture he was interrupted by cries
of "Throw 'em out! "v.catcalls, hoots and
hisses.
few iNTnunurnoxs.
In the audience was a sprinkling of
women whose ears were assailed with
utterances and expressions that brought
a blush to the faces of many hardened
listeners. On oho occasion the remarks
were so vile that Ruef himself was com
pelled to apologize to the women present.
In anticipating this article, Ruef, said
that the morning papers would say that
"a disgruntled and disappointed audience
filed from the hall, or left as fearing to
hear the foul expressions that were'fall
ing from his lips."
Interspersed through the audience were
many policemen in plain clothes, and
nearly every Commissioner aligned with
the Ruef movement. The great minority
of the audience comprised the respectable
people who came out of curiosity or to
listen to arguments.
\u25a0 j Several hundred men- whose faces are
well known in shady district politics as
jobholders or hangers-on at the City Hall,
or go-betweens of city officials and the
criminal element lurking- about the Hall
of Justice, sat for three hours last night
at the Alhambra Theater listening to
Abraham Ruef's abuse of almost every
thing in San Francisco saving Mayor
Schmitz, himself and his trusty fol
lowers.

PARADISE ~
ON
EARTH.
RICHEST SOIL; MOST HEALTHY CLIMATE
. ' in the world, - - .
THE PAJARO VALLEY in Santa Cruz Coun-
ty. 70 miles south of San Franoisco. is ac-
knowledged by all who have seen It to be
the "GARDEN SPOT" of California. -WHY ?
Because the soil is Infinitely more fertile
and productive than in any other part of
the State. NOWHERE in California can
such wonderful crops be raised as In the
Pajaro valley. A failure of crop or a
drought has never been known. Your hard
earned cash Is not spent in buying water,
but goes into the bank to swell your credit.
You get abundant rainfall from heaven, 25
to 35 Inches and without fall. Malaria, which
is so prevalent in all Irrigated* districts. Is
absolutely unknown. Mean temperature of
summer and winter does not vary 15 de-
grees. No heat in summer, no frost In win-
ter; It Is the most healthy and invigorating
climate In the world. Transportation facili-
ties to San Francisco are unequaled. New
electric railway to be completed within the
year. Be wire in time. Look before you
leap. Investigate for yourself. Return fare
from San Franoisco only $2 60. Tou will
thank us later. We can give you anything
from $500 up and give you the easiest terms.
Write for list of the best bargains and
literature on the valley.

The market tor all Fruits continues extremely,
firm, and It would not require much effort on
the part of holders to create a boom. The

the recent advance. Apricots have lately gone
up. Pears will be scarce this year and Apples

The wljeat market was under continuous
selling prcFSure throughout -the entire session.
At the opening the Septemoer option was ar
shade lower to a shade Higher at Ssi,c to)
Ss%c. A holiday at Liverpool turned first atj
tentlon to the wheat fields" of Minnesota and
the Dakotas. Weather In the Northwest was
ideal for the ripening of wneat In the northern
sections. Conditions were equally favorable ifr
harvesting where the grain had already mÂ»y
tared. Cutting was reported to be under WiiT
over a considerable area of tho spring wmat
belt. By the middle of next week the harvest
Is expected -to-be in full swing in North Da
kota. There was an absence of reports clalm
inc damage by- rust. Extreme weakness at
Minneapolis, was taken here as indicating that
there had been at least a temporary collap-te
of the blight scare: As a result of the condi
tions named prices here gradually crumbled.
An official forecast of fair weather to-morrow
for the Northwest " added bearish sentiment.
About the only .encouragement for the bulls
came from decreased receipts Southwest. Small
holders and pit traders .were principal sellers.
Offerings were taken by commission houFes.
From the start prices â¢ steadily declined, the
market closing weak ut the lowest point of the
day. Final quotations oti September were
63TÂ«c. Clearances of wheat and flour were
equal to 31,500 busheis. Primary receipts were
912,300 bushels, compared with 503.200 bushels
a year ago. Minneapolis, Duluth and Chicago
reported receipts of 460 cars, against 567 cart
last week and 203 cars a year ago.
Excellent prospects for a bumper crop caused
weakness In the corn market. Tho market
closed \u25a0at practically the ;o\vest . point. Sep
tember opened %9",4 c to %c lower at 53V.1Â®
r-iSc sold off to 52%5?53c end closed at 53c.
LocBl receipts were 104 cars, with 26 of con
tract grade.
" Oats were ' weak with prospects of a large
gain In local stocks. Cash houses were the
principal sellers, although there was consider
able profit-taking. Weakness In other grains
had a depressing effect. September opened %c
lower at 27% c, sold down to 26% c and closed
at 2G'A<s?27c. Â« ,
Provisions were a trifle . easier on proflt-tak-
Injr by" small holders, notwithstanding 'a small
advance In price of live* hogs. Weakness of
grain was a bearish influence. -At the close-
September pork was off 6c at $13 57%. Lard
and'rlbs wero also down 6c, closing at $7 42%

EASTERN MARKETS.
Trade in fresh fruits was of large volume,
with retailers purchasing freely for two days'
requirements, but despite the active trading
the market remained weak for all kinds of
fruits In bulk, the canners being out of the
market and supplies being too heavy for the
regular trade- to absorb. The canners being
etlll heavily burdened with contract supplies
of Bartlett Pears, were working to full ca
pacity* in their efforts .to work up the accu-,
mulattos, and several of the leading concerns
turned large lines of contract stocks of Pears
" and Peaches into the open ' market. - * Peaches
and Plums In open boxes were pressed for sale ,
at round . concessions, but handlers found it
impossible to effect clearances and large quan
tities of fine fruit 'were still unsold .at the
close. Small packages of most orchard fruits
were ! weak in sympathy with bulk etock. Figs
! and Apricots were exceptions, supplies of both
being extremely light. ' Choice offerings of
Grapes suitable for shipping were in good re
quest and firm, fine Muscats \u25a0 selling readily
for that purpose at $IÂ®l 15 per crate. Melons
were plentiful, but steady, and there- was a

COFFEEâ C. a Blckford's circular gives
the receipts at this port thus far this year at
215,643 bags, against 164.348 bags during the
same time last year. The sales from first
hands were 189.72S bags, against 136,973. The
etock In first hands August 1 was 51,702 bags,
against 56.824.
The circuar says:
"Quiet conditions prevailed until the middle
of July, since which time there has been an
active business embracing all descriptions,
but. as heretofore, the lower priced Coffees
being mostly sought after. Good to fine
washed Coffees are beginning to attract atten
tion by reason of their relative cheapness and
are moving more freely. The market closes
firm and the disposition on the part of dealers
to buy is more noticeable than for some time
Â»ast, which holders have so far readily met.
"The New York market has. strengthened
under adverse 'reports from Brazil concerning
the present crop and smaller receipts at the
ports than were expected. No actual change
in former estimates has so far been generally
made, but an Intimation has been given that
a reduction in figures might not be unlikely
In the near future.

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
Potatoes and Onions closed the week with
trade quiet and tha market In a seml-demor-*
alized condition. There is some shipping move
ment at low prices in river Potatoes, but
stocks are diminishing slowly, as the receipts
continue largo and every boat that arrives
adds to the accumulation on the wharves.
Bweet Potatoes ara arriving In small lots from
Fresno and Merced and the stock Is being ped
dled out at 4c per pound. â¢
' In the vegetable market String, Wax and
Lima Beans were stiff under extremely light
supplies and Peas and GrÂ«en Corn wer*
steady, while everything else on the list ruled
weak, notably Tomatoes and Cucumbers, the
market being glutted with those descriptions.
There was no movement whatever In Pickle
Cucumbers and the stock was piled high In
the stores awaiting buyers.

EASTERN LIVESTOCK MARKET.
NETTv' YOIIK. Aug. s.â The Financier says:
The official statement of tho New York assa
ciated banks this week again shows a. more or
less marked discrepancy between the esti
mated changes in \he cash Item as "computed
upon the basis of the traceable movements of
money and the amount reported in the state
ment, the latter showing a loss of $3,707,100,
while some eÂ«timales Indicated gains. The
discrepancy may be In part explained by the
increase in the unrecorded movements of money
between interior depositories located at min
ing centers and other Interior points. \u25a0 An
other notable feature of the bank statement
was an Increase of $1,167,100 in loans, which
carried the total of this item to the highest
on record, the previous maximum having been
$1,145,983,200 on October 8, 1004. Deposits de
creased $2,615.t500, or only $137,500 more than
the cum of the sain in ' cash less the con
traction in loans. Hence the statement made
good proof. The required reserve decreased
$<:64,660, deducting which from the loss \u25a0of
cash left $3.1-52,350 as lha decrease in surplus
reserve to $12,166,525. Computed upon the
basis of deposits, less those of $8,466,700 pub

PORTLAND, Aug. s.â Judge Frazer
of the State Circuit Court to-day -is
sued a temporary injunction
ing the sale of pools at the Irvlngton
race track. The V injunction- was
sought by the representatives of Eliza
beth Ryan, owner of the property
which is leased by the Multnomah Fair
Association. The effect of the decision
will be to stop all betting at the track
any may result in the abandonment of
the present racing season. A .peculiar
feature in connection with the case Is
that in years past' neither Elizabeth
Ryan nor her representatives have
done anything: but encourage the sale
of pools. It is alleged that the demurrer
was sought because; the bookmaklng
privilege Was not granted to a relative
of Elizabeth Ryan.
Briefly summarized, Judge Frazer's
decision was that the. -terms of the
lease on which the. defendants ha"d the
property oh which the Irvington track
is located prevented the use .of the
property for any unlawful purpose;
that the decision. of the Supreme Court
of the State Is that p,oolselling was an
indictable public nuisance, and, conse
quently, a crime and contrary to law.
.- motion was filed this afternoon to
dissolve the Injunction and the case
will be fought out again .'early next
week. In the meantime gambling at
the track will be stopped, as racing has
been suspended for one . week.' , The
temporary Injunction Issued on the ap
proving. of a bond of $10,000 put up by
the plaintiffs to guarantee any damages
on the part of the plaintiffs in case the
injunction Is dissolved on the final
hearing. Had It been shown that the
matter was simply a quarrel between
gamblers, . as the defendant . alleges,
Judge - Frazer said he -would have
thrown the case out of court.

VIENNA, ' Ausr. s.â Extreme heat prevailed
throughout Austria-Hungary to-day. Many
sunstrokes are reported.
Judge McCreedie showed the rest of the
Giants how to win a ball game yester
day. ! The Judge began to figure right in
the first inning when he walloped the
ball out of the lot for a homer." During
the sixth he hit, stole and arrived on
Eddie Householder's blngrlei scoring both
Portland's runs and making a regular
hero out of himself.' j
Jim : McDonald, the ever popular mdi- t
cator ; .wt elder, -was In action .once again, i
A man never, received a more gladsome J
hand of welcome than^ the one tendered I
to Jim when he stepped into the middle J
of the diamond. The' ' veteran' umpire
looks as young as ever and more hale -j
and hearty than in years. His decisions â¢
were just as good as they. used to be, and
that is'enough to suit both players and*
fans.. Bray worked on the bases yester-'
day, while McDonald judged the balls \
and strikes. ' . - \u25a0\u25a0*."\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 1
\u25a0 " The Portland lineup was switched again)
and looked more â¢ like a checker board j
than ever. Van .Buren was stationed at ]
second, while McLean chased 'em around â¢
1 the first bag, and Busher Conrad wore
i the cage. But when Oakland began to j
| look dangerous in the ninth spasm Judge |
McCreedie brought Garvin out to pitch.]
i put McLean behind the bat, Cates at sec- j
i ond and threw Conrad out. This change i
was the 'right dope, for the â¢ Commuters {
did not come through with a run. j
The only time Oakland figured at all j
' was'in the opening spasm, when Francks j
bit off a two-sacker .to deep left field, j
stole third and was bunted safely home
by Dunleavy. Oakland, as usual, was
handed several other chances to^grab a
run. or two, but they were always over
looked. ; :
Ham Iberg was the batting kid, tearing
off a pair of singles. This eclipses any
stunt with the stick Ham has done dur
ing the season, but his efforts were wast
ed, for no one was good enough to bring
him after he landed on the sacks.
Portland played a grand 'game in the
field, every man on the team getting
away.. with his work without missing
anything. Atz gobbled up a lot of hard
ones at short, -and ran out to the left
field bleachers and grabbed Kelly's hard
foul in the fourth. Dunleavy had six
chances in left,, while Van Haltren was
tTTere with five in center. The score:

CINCINNATI, Aug. 5. â A good card
was presented to the big crowd at La
tonia this afternoon, the feature being
a handicap at a mile and one hundred
yards. Haviland, recently claimed from
Ed Corrigan in a selling race by Jim
Stevens, won handily. Erla Lee- was a
surprise in the first race. Delagoa was
a warm favorite, but she ran as if not
out of the barn for a month. She ran
fairly in the fore part of the race, but
in \he stretch she died away and Erla
Lee, 30 to 1 in the betting, won in a
driving finish. The track was fast.

CONTAGIOUS
BLOOD POISON
Contagions Blood Poison more thor-
oughly poisons the blood than any other
disease. Every part of the body is af-
fected when the virus becomes intrenched
in the circulation; red eruptions xbreak
out on the Eltia, the mouth ana throat
ulcerate, glands in the neck and groins
swell, the hair falls out, copper-colored
. splotches appear on the body, etc.
I was afflicted with blood poison, and
the beat doctors did xno no good, though
I took their treatment faithfully. In
fact I seemed to get worse all the while.
I took almost every so-called blood rem*
cAy, but they did. not eeem to reach the
disease, and had no effect whatever. I
was disheartened, for it seemed that X
r would never be cured. At the advice ot
a friend I then took S. 5. B. and began to
improve. I continued tho medicine, and
â¢ it cured me completely. â._,,, . -\u0084
Haxalet, N. C. - W. B. NEWMAN.
So highly contagious is this disease
that many a life has been ruined by a
friendly hand shake or from using tbe
toilet articles of one affected with the
poison. To cure this hideous and hate-
ful disease a constitutional remedy is re-
. quired. S. S. S. goes down to the very
root of the trouble and forces out every
particle of the virus from the blood and
cures the disease permanently. S. S. S.
is purely vegetable and drives out the
trouble, rootand

PURELY VEGETABLE. S. S. S. can feel

White Sulphur Springs is probably
the oldest resort In California. It was
opened in 1554, and for twenty years
was me summering place for the fash
ionable set of this State.
ST. HELENA, Aug. s.â The main ho
tel building at White Sulphur Springs,
a few miles from here, was totally de
stroyed by lire at 2 o'clock this morn
ing. Nothing remains > of the old land
mark except the chimneys. The son
tents of the building are also 'a total
loss. The occupants had barely time
to save themselves, some escaping in
their night clothes.
The blaze was first discovered by the
Japanese servant In the vicinity of *the
men's dining-room. By . the time Mr.
Sanford, the \u25a0 proprietor, was arousod
the blaze was beyond oontrol and the
guests were all given warning. Much
time was consumed in finding an old
man eighty years old, who was unable
to help himself and who had to be car
ried out. By this time the upper half
of the building was ablaze and the
flames spread rapidly. A telephone mes
sage was sent to St. Helena, and about
fifty firemen went but and prevented
the flames from reaching the other
buildings or spreading to the hills.
Mr. Sanford believes that the fire was
of incendiary origin, as there had been
no fire near tne spot where the blaze
first appeared. A short time before
the flames broke out he heard some one
drive toward the hotel and afterward
depart. An attempt to burn the hote'.
was made, he says, less than a week
ago. The loss vas about $10,000. with
$7000 insurance.

WINNEMUCCA. New, Aug. 5.â A dis
astrous fire swept through the busi
ness section of Winnemucca this morn
ing:, burning sixteen business houses
and causing: damage variously esti
niated at $100,000. The blaze started
at 4:30 o'clock this morning in Armory
Hall and raged all morning, the efforts
of the lire department being' of no
avail while the eagwr flames were de
vouring the row of frame buildings
that stood in their path.
Within four hours the fire was un
der control, but the greatest precau
tions are being taken U> prevent a fresh
start from the smoking ruins.
\u25a0 The heaviest loser is the Eagle Jew
elry and Drug Company, which lost its
magnificent building and much of its
stock, Its total loss amounting to
$24,000.
Most of the property-owners say
they will rebuild at once, although
few of them had insurance on their
property on account of the high rate 3
charged. The town will be in dark
ness for several days on account of
the damage to the electric light system.

The Standard Oil Company's ship
Astral ha 6 been ready for sea for a
week, but although she cleared yes
terday, there is little likelihood of her
getting away for several days. The
matter of getting a crew for the ship
Is in the hands of H. A. Byrnes, a clerk
In the employ of ttie Pacific Oil Com
pany. Sailors are not plentiful at pres
ent, but there are more men on the
beach than required to man the Astral.
Byrnes, however, is said to be trying
to get a bargain in crews. While
others are paying the ruling rate and
glad to get men at that figure, Byrnes
is offering $5 a month less and the
shipping masters have ceased trying to
find cut-rate sailors for the Astral.
Meanwhile the big ship, with a valu
able cargo, is wasting John D. Rocke
feller's money In un-Standard Oil-like
Idleness.

-Hal : 6^ Sale Now r
San Francisco's most important -merchandising event: California's greatest economy time
begins to-morrow.
For the past weeks hundreds have been watching the growth of our new six-story building on
Sixth streetâ and the work that is being done to make the Market-street store six stories tall â to give
\Hale's about four acres of floor space for the proper housing of this great dry' goods business.
A move that means an absolute disposal of present ,stocks as far as possible to clear the way
for only "new goods in the new store."
Present stocks have been gone over carefully. Prices have been whittled and cut until in many
cases your dollar has bee?i given twice its ordinary buying power.
Every department in the store is interested â from Crockery on the third floor, through
â¢ Millinery, Cloaks and Suits, Draperies, i n . ' . .... i
