Cross-Channel Vessel Hilda
Meets Disaster During
a Storm.
LONDON", Sot. 13 â The Southwest
ern H:illivnj*Â» cross-channel steamer
Hilda Matt wrecked tills morntntc off
St. Malu, on the north coast of Prance,
and ft is believed that 100' or more of
her ptMttentzer* and crew were drowned.
The HfWffttffl Souu'iarnpton xm i -Fri-
day night for St. Malo with 125 persons
on board. Her passage was greatly
delayed by a fog in the channel, and
when nearing St. Malo she ran Into a;
severe snovvetorn.. apparently missed
her course and foundered on the rocks
off Jardin lighthouse, three miles from
St. Malo. (
The company's steamship Ada, out
ward bound from St. Malo, rescued five
of the passengers and one of the crew."
These are now on the way to South
ampton. There is an unconfirmed re
port'that seventy had been saved, *
The crew numbered twenty-six and
there were about a hundred passengers,
all Frenchmen, the majority being
onion dealers from St. Brieuc and
neighborhood.
A telegram from St. Servan, adjoin
ing the town of St. Malo. gives the few
particulars yet available. The Hilda
was near St. Malo on Saturday morn
ing. She struck the rocks at 4 o'clock
en Sunday morning in the roadstead
off the Island of Cerambre, having
missed the tide owing to bad weather
and fog.
PASSENGERS ASLEEP AT TIME.
The majority of the crew and passen
gers were asleep at the time. Two
boats were lowered, one of which con
tained five men and arrived at St. Se
veran. The second boat was picked
up empty at St. Cast, where thirteen
bodies were washed ashore. The top
of the Hilda's funnel and her mast are
visible at low tide, according to the
telegram from St. Severan.
The Hilda was built at Glasgow in
1832 and registered Â£48 tons. She was
& screw steamship of iron construction
and vti Â£Â£6 feet in length. \u25a0
The Southwestern Railway Company
la as yet unable to give a list of the
Hilda's passengers, but officials cay that
a score booked passage at stations be
tween London and Southampton and
that to the best of their knowledge
ninety-nine were drowsed and only six
saved.
The company is still without reliable
details as to how the disaster occurred.
Its agents at St. Malo only briefly re
ported:
"The Ada has put back and reports
the Hilda is a total wreck at Lesportes
Reef, outside Jardin Lighthouse. The
Ada's boat saved five onion men and a
seaman named Grinter out of the rig
ging. They appear to be the only sur
vivors."
VICTIMS OF PROMINENCE.
ST. MALO. France, Nov. 19.: â The
o^ict number of lives lost on' the Hilda
is unknown here. It Is understood that
there were about tweuty flrst-elass pas
sengers, including sever* l English peo
ple.
Among the la tier viere the Hon. Mrs.

ohkli. and Colonel KHlet. Though It Is
not certain that these were actually on
hourd. they were expected to travel. by
the Hilda nnd it fs known that all the
tirÂ«f-claÂ»s - paxsr^&erM were, drowned.

The delay in the arrival of the Hilda
at liret inspired little anxiety, as there
was drÂ«adful weather in the channel, and
k as. every one had full confidence in her \u25a0 '

Overcome by the V
Smoke.
GLASGOW, Nov. 19.â The most terrible
fire that has occurred in Great Britain
in many years broke out here to-day in
a cheap lodging house for men in Watson
street and resulted in the lots of thirty
nine lives. In addition thirty- two persons
were injured.
The flames were first noticed at 6
o^clock this morning on the fourth floor
of the building which was occupied by 330
men. An alarm was raised and the fire
men responded quickly, but flames ; and
smoke were then issuing from most; of
the windows on the fourthr /floor. An
extraordinary scene was created by a pro
cession of almost naked men rushing out
of the entrance to the building and
against their frantic efforts to' escape the
firemen had actually to fight for. admis
sion. -.'-\u25a0 t .. ' ... \u25a0 '. ,
Reaching the upper floors, the firemen
found that the narrow passages: were be
coming congested with : : men: who j had
dropped to the floors overcome by smoke.
.The firÂ«. fc however,,, was .confined to,, the
fourth floor, * aid as . soo n as /the ) firemen
were able .to^Ket to work It . wajÂ« speedUy.:
extinguished. " The^'flames* were -ted' by
the wooden partitions ' which - threw | off
Voluniea of smoke resulting in
tion of the inmates. Several' others, had
to be taken -to hbsDitals.;/ '' /- â¢, â¢
.The dead were mostly workmen in the
prime of life. They presented a horrible
sight. Many were sleeping in the attio
above the burning fourth floor and had
narrow escape. The flames burst through
the floor and it was impossible for the
men to descend." The windows were se
curely fastened and the men had to break
them so that they could climb throuirh
to' neighboring roofs.
By 10 o'clock a search of the building
was made and a complete list of the vic
tims obtained which showed that thirty
nine were dead and thirty-two injured.
It appears to be the custom of these
lodgers to sleep in a nude condition and
the march of the survivors to the police
station was 'a fantastic one. Some had
snatched the covers of the beds and
others their : trousers while many wore
nothing. The local authorities had to be
called upon to supply the men with cloth
ing and warm meals. Owing to their
migratory habits and the absence of
permanent homes many of the dead will
never be identified. The Identification of
others Is rendered difficult by the absence
of clothing.
ONE MARRIAGE

Special Dispatch to TtÂ« Call.
, CHICAGO, Nov. 19.â Chicago has gone
divorce mad. More than fifty 'cases of
family discord were docketed yesterday,
occupying the' attention of six Judges
and probably 100 lawyers. Nineteen
deorees of divorce and of separate main
tenance were granted and others are
under advisement by the Judges.
On Friday there werÂ«-issued in Chi
cago \only thirty-eight marriage li
censes. Seventeen decrees of divorce
were granted on that day.- On the same
day eighty burial permits. were Issued.
According to the method of computa
tion employed by statisticians, thirty
two of these would be : for/ husbands
or wives. Forty-nine families therefore
were broken up by death . and divorce,
while only thirty-eight new families
were created. \u25a0> ;: ''
On Thursday the ' families disrupted
by death were fourteen in number, -by
divorce five and" forty-nine marriage
licenses .were- issued. ;..\u25a0
During the week there were fifty
seven decrees of divorce and- one of

Groom Divorced
Three Months
Ago.
ATTEMPT TO
EVADE LAW
H. E. Mills Is
Wed to Mrs.
Treadway.
There was much Interest on tha
water front yesterday over a romantic
marriage at sea. Herbert E. Mills, an
Eastern bookmaker, failing 1 to gat a
license In Oakland because he had been
divorced but three months from wif a
No.^ I, ' Induced Mrs. Julia Treadway. a
Chicago widow, to brave the rain and
rough seas to become his wife threo
marina leagues , from the shores of
California. . HHRH
The officiating director, of the.matri
monial contract was Captain Harry M.
Speyer, a popular master .mariner of
this port. Under the direction oC
Thomas Crowley. owner of the gaso
line launch Meteor, and James Sinnott,
his employe, the good launch plowed
her way through the rough waters of
the bay, braved the "potato patch."
and In good time* landed the,, seaside '
bridegroom and the sailor-like brides
nine miles from the sound of whistles
and bells. Then it was that Captain
Speyer pronounced the words that the
contracting parties believed muds
them husband and wife.
When seen last. night the bride
groom, for some reason, denied that h*
had been a party to *o recent a>mar
riage and - protested, that' the . lady
whose name had been coupled with his
in Iso - "ridiculous" a way had , been
helping to sew on his buttons for
nearly a score of years.
At his 'apartments In : the Hotel Hamil
ton, where the bookmaker said the story
of his marriage was "too funny for any
thing," he showed the picture of a wom
an who, V according to his . story, wna his '
companion of the day, exhibiting also th*
picture 'of ; a^ boy of *13 ; years. "This i is
our son.", he said, "and surely the rumor'
is ellly." ;
... "Were not you and the lady on the tug
boat yesterday , morning?" he .was ' asked,
"and did you not remain until late in the
evening?" .
/ *'Yes." . replied Mills. Vbut my wife Is
fond of boating and we desired to see thÂ«
ocean.- so -we went* out beyond the Cliff
House.V
*At.the:hour Mrs. MLls selected for her
remarkable " outing ' the rain . was , cominar
down, the .waves were rollhig high on the
bay, . arid there was " every indication o!
rough weather at sea for so frail a craft./
i ' Mr.*. Mills was very seasick after reach- .
Ing Tdeep water, and there. is some doubt
whether 'he "remembers. Just what hap
pened. ~ If lt^ seemed ' nineteen ; years , slnca
Mrs. .Treadwell said she .would be his for->

Big- Blaze in a Distillery in
Pennsylvania Causes :Loss
at Overhalt Plant Which
Will Beach $4,000,000
CONNELLSVILLE, Pa., Nov. 19.â At
the A. Overhalt distillery at Broadford
to-day 810,000 gallons of whisky fur
nished a spectacular fire, entailing a
loss of $4,000,000. The main bonded
warehouse was burned to, the ground.
A steady northeast wjnd, which blew
the flames toward the Youghiogheny
River, saved the town of Broadford, the
buildings of the H. C. Frick Coke Com
pany and the Baltimore and Ohio Rail
road station from destruction. â¢ .
Smoke was first seen issuing from
the third-story of the distillery, which
was alongside tho Baltimore and Ohio
tracks. Joseph McDonald and George
Patckin, two employes, climbed up the
fire escape and opened one of the small
iron doors. They were caught in a suf
focating cloud of smoke and they
dropped unconscious on the fire escape.
They were rescued by other workmen
and a general alarm was sounded.
The blue-tinged flames from thÂ©
burning alcohol were soon shooting
more than 100 feet into the air. As
barrels of old rye whisky on each of
the floor burst the blazing liquid was
splashed in all directions. The main
track of the railroad was kept clear of
debris and passenger trains shot past
at such speed as to avoid damage from
the intense heat. Calls for helD were
sent to Connellsvllle, Uniontown and
McKeesport.
Broadford is but two miles from here
and the Connellsville Fire Department
on a special train reached the scene
quickly. The men by hard work man
aged to Bave the -buildings near by
and the calls to the two other towns
were withdrawn.
The ruined building and its contents
were still burning fiercely, at midnight,
but the structures surrounding it have
been so thoroughly soaked with water
that no further loss is feared.
It â¢is supposed that the fire was
started cither from a spontaneous com*
bustion or from a spark thrown by. a
passing locomotive. The Overhalt plant
is practically owned by H. C. Frick and
the Mellons of Pittsburg. # , ,

BIG BREAKWATERS
TO BE CONSTRUCTED
San Cristobal to Be Made
"the Pri ncipal City on th e
'Atlantic Side of the (jreat
Waterway A cross Isthm us
WASHINpTON, Nov. 19.â The Board of
Consulting Engineers of the Isthmian Ca
nal Commission- has decided to substitute
Brussels for Paris as the meeting-place
of the . foreign members next January.
The reason for this decision is that Brus
sels Is more conveniently, situated for sev
eral of the members. - The 'American | en
gineer who will go to Brussels with th*
documents to be signed has not^yet been
chosen. .During this week a committee
of three members of the board, with Gen
eral Davis as their chairman, will make
a rough draft of the final report, which
will then have to be .worked out in de
tail and is expected to be ready about
the end of December.
The sea level canal, which has been de
cided upon by the members, will have* a
width at the bottom of 150 feet, except
In the Culebra cut, where that width
will be 200 feet. The greater width in
the cut is necessary to allow two ships
to pass each other safely between the
high banks of the canal which will be
formed by the very deep excavation.
The plan as adopted by the board would
make Llmon Bay one of the greatest har
bors of the world.. Almost through the
middle of the bay a breakwater will be
built and a shorter breakwater will be
built from San Cristobal, which is in
American territory, thereby leaving Co
lon, which belongs to the republic of
Panama, outside of the American canal
works. Under the plan as adoptfd by
the board San Cristobal is exoented to
become the chief city on the Atlantic
side of the canal and the promontory on
which stands the statue of Columbus will
be covered with official buildings, docks,
coalinsr stations and all the\works neces
sary for an important harbor. Â» The canal
constructed by the French began at San
Cristobal. .
PLAN ON PACIFIC SIDE.
It Is now proposed by the board to build
a short direct canal from Mmdi to Limon
Bay, thereby making the. distance shorter
by a few hundred yards and also facili
tating navigation and making it possible
for shiDs to sail into the canal without
having any difficult turns.
The breakwaters necessary for. the
formation of this harbor of San Cristobal
will be an item of ereat expense. .They
were the subject" of long! discussions in
the meetings of the board. ' They â¢ would
have been necessary, in case a lock canal
had; been chosen. - . ;. .
On the Pacific side at Panama'the plans
as adopted yesterday are also different
from those of the French Canal Com
pany. The French canal ends at La Boca,
and it wa.s found as one of the difficulties
that the Rio Grande .with- its many
branches crosses the ', canal and : 'in the
rainy senson inundates it and does great
'damage to the works already constructed
by the French. Therefore it was decided
that the canal should be built nearer, to
the city of Panama and should run be
tween two hills, one called Sosa and the
other the wellrknown Ancon.- Ancon is
the higher of the, two. On it the Ameri
can hospitals are built and it is one of the
most healthful places on the isthmus.
OXE LOCK TO BE BUILT. .
At this place the one lock, necessitated
through the difference in the fides of the
Atlantic and the Pacific, will 'be built.
This lock, however, will not retard the
progress of ships through the canal. In
the first place ships coming from the Pa
cific will have to stop some time anyway
to be visited by health officers and by. ci
vilian authorities, and, furthermore, dur
ing a large part of. the day this lock will
be entirely open, as the levels of "both
oceans will , be equally high. At the Pa
cific side no plans have yet been made
for breakwaters. .;
The plans for constructing a lock canal
at thirty feet altitude were never dis
cussed, and from the beginning the board
was divided into twogroups, of eight and
five members, one in favor of the sea level
plan and the other in favor, of a 'lock
canal. A compromise plan was never
brought up at any'; time. .
It can be authoritatively: reiterated that
none of the foreign delegates to the board
came here with specific' instructions from
their governments. The members of the
board came here at the bidding of tho
United States and their governments gave
them a long leave of ; absence bo ? that
they mlghf give , their services \to this
country, sending : them : without' any in
structions whatever. They will leave
Washington by next Sunday and stay' a
few days in New Ybrk before leaving for
Europe.' ' / ' J:
On Tuesday night: next General! Davis,
chairman of the Board of Consulting En
gineers, will entertain the: foreign dele
gates at a farewell dinner at-hls home. ; V
The cost of the .sea-level 1 canal Is
estimated by the engineers at about
$230,000,000. â¢\u25a0\u25a0.'Although: (this- amount
seems muchÂ« ; larger, than' the; amount
necessary for the construction of a lock
canal, It is claimed by -the advocates of,
the sea-level plan to. be ! in reality only
comparatively, slightly; higher. .v
It was pointed: out' in the; meetings
of the. Â«oard that the lock canal .would
necessitate ' betwee'ri _ : $30,000,000 and
$40,000,000 : - payment \u25a0 for ;; the .': private
grounds and the lands belonging to, the
republic of Panama, ; which would" be ' in

SABBATH PASSES QUIETLY. "
/Apprehensions that the defeat of j the
Reds in the Council might inspire them to
take violent measures yesterday against
the troops or the merchants who refused
to close their places of business . on Sat
urday when ordered by the leaders were
happily, without foundation, though ru
mors of collisions between workmen and
troops in the Vasliiostrov and Putiloff dis
tricts were in circulation.'
At police headquarters, however, it was
said that there had been no disorders and
at strike headquarters the press was in
formed that there had been no collision,
though, perhaps, a few shots might have
been fired into the air by, over-exuberant
demonstrators^ Nevertheless, the patrols
in the J streets Cwere \ doubled yesterday.
These were generally commanded by non
commissioned"omeers,: showing that,' in
spite of the- rumors of dissatisfaction
among the troops, the Government was
not^ afraid to trust the soldiers of: the
Guard at large without commanding offi
cers. -
The high sounding proclamation with
which the Council of , Workmen announced
the end of the str...e, declaring that the
"demonstration" had served its purpose
by saving the lives of the mutineers at
Kronstadt, while, of ,course,'. it is - prin
cipally a blind to cover, the^dfcfeat, as the
trials of' the. mutineers are still in prog
resses at the same^time shrewd tactics for
use Jn .tht^propagranda: which the^coun
cil 13 "actively / pushing lirn'ongUhe 'army
aiid navy.',' oiich' a ciaim," however, cannot
disguise tl^' fact that the- strike' was in
augurated to compel the Government not
only to pardon unconditionally the mu
tineers, but to abolish martial ': law in
Poland, and to compel the calling of a
constituent assembly, none of which oo
jects have been achieved.
PUBLIC SYMPATHY ALIENATED.
The refusal of | the affiliated organiza
tions in the interior to respond to the
call and the revolt of many of the bet
ter, class of workmen hero against the
dictation of political agitators and walk
ing delegates by jno means represents the
full measure of. the real I defeat of the
strike movement; The strike, by alien
ating public sympathy and opening the
eyes of intelligent Liberals and Moder
ates to the fact that the first duty of
the hour was, to^ stand by the Govern
ment in its efforts to tranauillize the
country, and to make head against the
tide: of socialism \ and revolution, -.which
was threatening Russia with, anarchy,
aided greatly .to the ! formation :of _- the
new Law and Order party, which has "now
sprung into formidable -being. 'â¢\u25a0 %^:
"^lnterest has now shifted to Moscow,

BIGGER GUNS
FOR THE ARMY
WASHINGTON, Nov.- 19.--The report of
General "Williaa Crozier. chief of ord
nance. Is so replete with technical infor
1 matlon concerning the arms and arma
ment of the United States army - that
Lieutenant General Chaffee, chief of staff,
has recommended that a codV of it be
sent to each officer in the army. General
Crozier presents some interesting infor
mation showing the growth of gun con
struction: how it has advanced from old
style guns to. meet improved conditions;
the Increase in the . thickness of armor
and the Improved powder used.
A problem now confronts ordnance of
ficers on account of. the wearlnjc of the
bore of the gun through, the great ve
locity of the projectile, with the result
that "after some nfty or sixty rounds
from larire Runs the rifling is so worn
away that thÂ«Â» projectiles are no longer
given the motion of rotation necessary
to steadiness of flight and inadmissible
loss of accuracy results." The question
whether the guns should not be used at a
power less than their strength is being
considered. The report says:
"It must be remembered that in thu3
using the guns at less power, the energy
of the projectile Is reduced by a sacrifice
of that quality which it loses soonest In
flight In any event, namely, the velocity:
and It also must be remembered that it
la auitÂ« possible to . retain the_ superior
ity of the gun over anything" which It
is railed upon. to attack by using larger
calibers for given work and by build
ing guns of larger size than is now cus
tomary, experimental constructions. a.<Â»
well as theory, and natural foresight, hav
ing shown that the present conventional
maximum need by no means be accepted
as a -limit."- - â¢.â¢
General Crozier says that at the sug
gestion of the President further \u25a0 consid
eration by the general staff resnlted In
the substitution of a knife for a rod bay
onet for the army rifles. He adds:
"In view of the Instructions of the Pres
ident of the United States that the utility

drew J. Clunie and former Governor
James 11. Budd with those of Thomas
J. Clunie, the ex-Commissioner's de
ceased brother, and other prominent
attorneys of this city in the life in
surance companies' investigation has
not tended to abate the interest of
policy holders in this State in the sub
ject of life insurance and its methods
of being operated.
The Implied charges of S. S. Me-
Curdy, assistant registrar of the Equi
table Assurance Company, in effect
that bis company, the New York Life
and the Mutual Life of New York, were
compelled to employ counsel friendly
to former Commissioner Clunie to stop
that official's activity in investigations
of the companies have led to a general
opening up of the life insurance com
panies' relations to the official regula
tion of those corporations in this State.
The former Commissioner has taken
the position that for the time being he
-will not go into a detailed history of
his dealings with the "Big Three"
companies of New York while he was
Insurance Commissioner. He awaits
reply from C A. Hughes, attorney of
the New York legislative investigation
committee, to his telegram offering to
go before the committee and explain
there his acts as Insurance Commis
sioner of California. Clunie Insists
that Hughes has first call. . His future
course toward McCurdy*s statements
depends upon the Eastern investigat
or* attitude.
RECOMMENDS SEW LAWS.
E. Myron Wolf, present State Insur
ance Commissioner and Clunie's suc
cessor, has given close official atten
tion to the developments in New York.
He has framed a. line 'of action with
relation to the department of life in
surance, and has prepared a general
plan for his official attitude as a result
of the exposures of maladministration
of the companies' affairs. Wolf has
decided to go before the Legislature
and recommend important changes In
the laws covering the regulation of
Insurance companies in California. He
has decided that there should be a lim
itation on the assets of these com
panies and that no company should be
allowed to do business in this State if
Its assets are more than $500,000,000.
Wolf also believes there should be
concerted action by the States of the
Union so that legislation might be
made uniform as to restriction and ,
regulation.
. In deference, however, to the ex- ]
pressed desire of Chairman Armstrong
of the New York (investigating commit
tee Wolf Bays he will await the report
of that committee before making a
formal statement on the subject.
Touching the matter. Wolf said yester
day:
"Under a policy of interstate com
mittee it has been the custom of In
surance commissions throughout the*
United States to accept the report of
the Commissioner in the home State of
a company as to that company's solv
ency. Commissioners, of course, have
the right to investigate any company
doing- business or applying for the
right to do business in a State. But in
the great number of cases, and I know
of no exception, the home report has
been accepted on the score of ability
to pay policies.
COMPANIES ABB SOLVENT.
"At the recent convention of Insur
ance Commissioners of the United
States held in New Hampshire, which
I attended, a special committee on life
Insurance submitted an exhaustive re
port. It was agreed that all of the
developments of the New York Investi
gation had shown that the companies
were solvent and had maintained their !
reserves. This is the vital thing to us as
Commissioners. There was a sentiment I
manifested by the convention to wait
until the New York committee bad com
pleted its inquiry and had reported be
fore we should take official action look
lug toward State legislation. It was
decided that uniformity in State regu
lation was desirable to avoid confusion
and to place the business throughout
the Union on a surer, basis. Notice
vras taken of general schemes of Im
provement In this regard. Greater
publicity in the business, the prevent
ing of syndicate deals with policy hold
ers' money, the preventing of all such
transactions which have exposed
Ijy the investigation were favored. :
"So far as I am concerned I shall
be ready to go before the State Legis
lature with several recommendations j
for belter control of life insurance
business, as soon as the committee's
report is made public.
-The most important bill I would
urgre would be one to place a limit, on
the assets of a company doing business
in this ritnte. I favor a law. to pro
hibit any company from operating . in
this State with more than $500, 000,000
assets. This flsrure Is* taken because
some of the large Eastern companies
now under fire are carrying more than
$400,000,000, and they should be given
fair notice of such a limitation. With
$500,000,000 assets a company would
have plenty -to do to take care. of the
business on its books. It's the new.
business which costs so much for prem
iums, commissions, advertising and the
like. There Is a limit' to the amount of
money one group of men should be per-*
mitted to handle.. To limit the assets
Â©f these giant companies would be In
the policy holders' favor, for. It would
tend to cut down the dangers of un

VELOPMENTS IN THE NEW TORK INVESTIGATION CHANGES IN CALI
FORNIA STATUTES ARE URGENTLY NEEDED. .':\u25a0
lawful use of their iÃ<jney by the com
panies' officials." :
"There is no doubt in my mind that
the syndicate use of the life insurance
companies' money as has been disclosed
is criminal and can be reached by the
law as It now stands.
"The abuses attaching to the placing
of favored relatives in fancy positions,
sinecures, at large salaries, without
reference to qualifications or ability, is
an evil that needs to be eradicated.
"1 am of the opinion that Federal su
pervision of life Insurance companies
could not be enforced. The Supreme
Court-has decided that life insurance is
not a matter of Interstate commerce.
It seems therefore that the States
through their Legislatures could be
brought to act in unison and harmony
as to regulations, which will result un
doubtedly from the New York investi
gations. The subject of Federal super
vision was very carefully handled at
the Commissioners' convention by Dep
uty Attorney General Nash of Massa
chusetts. He took a stand against it
and presented an elaborate argument.
"In my Investigations of life Insur
ance companies -which have applied for
permission to conduct business In Cali
fornia I havo demanded examinations
of their books in three cases. My pur
pose, frankly stated to their represen
tatives, was to induce them to with
draw their appllcatlonsAbecause I did
not believe they were strong enough to
do business here. The effect of â¢ de
manding examinations was what I ex
pected. Rather than' to submit to the
heavy expense Involved they with
drew."
NO CONFERENCE WITH GLUNIE.
Wolf said he had not consulted with
his predecessor, Clunie, either at the
time he took office or since, touching
insurance matters.
"So far as I am concerned," Wolf con
cluded, "I am ready at all times to en
force the law and shall continue to en
force any acts of the Legislature : that
may go on the statute, books. The main
point, so far as the protection of policy
holders Is concerned, is to determine
whether a company is solvent. If I
considered there' were needof" Investi
gation of any company on that score I
should not hesitate to start one."
Former Commissioner Clunie was a
bit Impatient yesterday as to the'im
plication that his official acts had been
controlled by the employment of his
brother as counsel^ for the life insur
ance companies. He chafed under; the
pressure, but insisted that his duty
was Jo give Hughes at New York first
call upon him.
â¢ "I feel that in view of the fact that
these matters have been given publicity
through Attorney Hughes' inquiry that
he, first of -all, is entitled to have all
of the Information I can give him. So
far as my work as Insurance Commis
sioner Is concerned, I tried to do â¢ for.
the policy-holders of California what
Hughes himself is doing. My effort
was to learn what the companies were
doing with their deferred â dividends,
what they were doing in the payment
of ; salaries. I wanted thorn .to keep
books' in California showing tneir dlvi
' dend accounts, their lapses and.accu
mulations for the benefit . of \*policy
holders. My work in that regard will
show for Itself. And. I desire : to say
right here that no one could or<did con- w
trol me â¢in that work. So far as the
insinuations concerning myself and
my dead brother are concerned, 1 have
nothing to add to my denials here and
to my telegram to Mr. Hughes."
BUDD MAKES STATEMENT.
Ex-Governor," Budd yesterday gave a
general , review, of his connection with
the matter. He srJd he had appeared as
an arbitrator of ; differences between the
life insurance companies and Commis
sioner Clunie. He^saidr }- \u0084 ?Â£!
"Clunie; had. made ,a demand upon the
life insurance companies for, information
and for records .which their officials con-~
sidered was not .warranted \u25a0 by; law. : He
had been very . persistent in â¢ pursuing an
lnaulry â¢ that he believed was . ; for \u25a0-; the
benefit of ; the ; policy,"' holders. Matters
reached such a ctage that the companies
.' ,tHE, SAN 'FRANCISCQ! CALL, MONDAY, NOVEMBER. 20, 1905.
decided ; to ; retain counsel to make a re
port upon the legal phases of the situa
tion that could be accepted by Clunie as
trustworthy. "..; . ; . \u25a0 . \u25a0 . .'.â¢., ..'
"It was no* doubt known to the com
panies' | representatives here that I was
very close to Clunie. "I had appointed 'him
Insurance Commissioner, had known him
from childhood, and he. reposed much con
fidence In me. It was .understood,, as I
remember, that my appointment must be
satisfactory to Clunie. I was to examine
-the law, to examine the records of. the
companies in New York, to make a very
exhaustive Inquiry concerning the rights
of the company in this State, and to
make a report in writing.
"That work covering many months
was done. I was satisfied aftercomplet-
Ihg my investigations that Clunie in some
instances had overstepped the law, and
I so advised him. \ I remember we had
several differences of opinion on the sub
ject. One of the points brought up was
whether a foreign > corporation could be
compelled to keep its records in this
State. Another auestion was vas to the
valuation of policies. I came to the con-,
elusion that a foreign corporation could,
not be compelled to reproduce its records
here. As to valuation of policies, which
was one of ', the elements in discovering
the financial standing of a company, I
determined :. that the fee then allowed
of three per cent on each 1000 of valuation
was entirely too high. Under; the ap
pointment, I held from' Clunie" at 'the time
I could have, forced a ''total 'fee of more

REPORTS TO CLUNIE.
\u0084 "In my report to Clunie I gave . him
a .complete statement of ,â¢ my views and
went over the situation as ' I saw it
from the standpoint of a . lawyer.
The insurance companies were given to
understand that my 'opinions would be
received by Clunie as 'trustworthy, in
that because of our long personal \u25a0; rela
tions he would have confidence :in - me.
At this time, four . or five years after my
service â¢ terminated, it would be . impossi
ble for me to say in detail what was
done. I \u25a0 know that Mr.: Chickering, the
attorney for the Mutual- Life 1 Insurance
Company, who - retained ; me, â¢ and \u25a0 myself
had - conferences concerning I amendments
to the insurance laws of this State, and
I would say now, that the matter of re
serve surplus and : such items were con
sidered. The. - general "trend of . : the
amendments and * the * work as ; a \u25a0 whole
that I did was to* determine more closely
what the insurance laws of the State
meant. -".^ ; \u25a0\u25a0'â¢,- !' -' .. - v -'-' : -' -t=, ;

town lying on the "Willamette River a
couple of miles south of the . city limits
of Portland. According to the charter of
the city of Portland, â¢ which is \u25a0 in
Multnomah County, granted by the State
Legislature, the police power of Portland
to suppress gambling extends a distance
of four miles outside .the boundaries of
the city.
At the time the charter was massed
there was no \u25a0 incorporated tqwn within
four miles of Portland's limits. Subse
quently,- however, the" Legislature passed
an act Incorporating the city of '. Mil

cities: _1

anew the search for the missing girl.
Many were on horseback, ready to hunt
In the hills where the young woman was
supposed to have hidden herself.
Miss Blossom now lies under the doc
tor's care, guarded cloeely by nurses^ In
her mother's home, from which she es
caped in such extraordinary fashion
Saturday morning. She was a fever
patient In a precarious condition when she
climbed from her room in the second
â¢story of the Blossom house shortly after
midnight yesterday, and for four hours
was exposed to the chill and "mist of the
raw air, as she groped her way through
Berkeley streets, dressed only in a thin
nlpht robe, an underskirt, and a pair of
fancy slippers. It Is feared that the ex
perience she has undergone will result

ASKS. FOR SHELTER.
Miss Blossom appears to have walked
from her mother's home on Ridge road,
in North Berkeley, in the direction of the
West End, and after three hours of wan
dering, she' asked for shelter at Mr. Pur
cell's home. The Purcells did not know
the girl's identity, and failed to notify
the authorities of her presence in their
home. She arrived at the Purcells at
7 o'clock Saturday morning.
The' Purcell family pay that Miss Blos
som's talk was incoherent; that she spoke
of having run away from her people
lieear.se of trouble at home, and that she
could not tell them her name or place of
residence. This morning the young
woman asked the Purcells to direct her
to a telephone in the neighborhood. She
was taken to the home of Henry Struhm,
a block away, at 210S Fifth street, and
there she attempted to send telephone
messages to imaginary persons.
â¢ Mr. Struhm promptly decided that the
young woman was 'not sane.' He notified
Marshal Vollmer, and Detective Jamison,
with Dr. McCleave, who had been Miss
"Blossom's physician went at once in a
carriage to Struhm's home. When they
arrived the girl was at the telephone.
She caught a glimpse of the men and
fled from the room, out the back door,
over the back yard fence, running like a
; startled deer, j Detective Jamison and
Policeman Lestrange, who was also pres
ent, caught the girl after she had run
a block. . \
IN* PRECARIOUS STATE.
"Please let me go," cried Miss Blossom.
"I don't want to go where you are going
to take me. I want to go home."
"That Is where we will take, you. Miss
Blossom," said Jamison, and then the
girt consented to enter the carriage.
When the Blossom home was reached,
and the girl observed the crowd of people
who had gathered there to help in the
search for her, she begged her attendants
to disperse the people. She was sufficient
ly sane to dread meeting the crowd,
dressed as she was, in unconventional
garb.
In the Blossom home, where had been
deepest grief and mental 'tdrture so
great as to almost make the girl's mother
Insane, was enacted a moving scene when
the unfortunate girl was brought In. She
had been given up for dead, and the re
action from despair proved too much for
the members of the family. The mother
fainted, and the two sisters of Miss Blos
som were almost prostrated.
Miss Blossom was out to bed. Dr. Mc-
Cleave fears that a relapse will follow
the young woman's exploit. She is de
lirious now, and will be watched carefully
by trained nurses until recovery Is gained,
or death claims her. \u25a0â¢

Means of Saving Boy's Life
-OAKLAND, Nov. IS.â Struck down by
a random bullet flre'd by a foolhardy
marksman' who was shootiric at a target
this afternoon, Malcolm Deck, the'fifteen
year-old son of Edmund M. Deck, a con
ductor in the emDlov >;of v .the Oakland
Traction Company, now. lies. dangerously
wounded at the home of his j parents, at
6<l Thirty-fifth street. That the boy was
not instantly killed was due ,to the fact
that the bullet was deflected by. the bones
of his right, shoulder, and. instead of
penetrating to a vital: spot ranged around
the ribs and lodged near j.the spine. '\u25a0
Deck, with two companions,. Frank and
Harry McCloy, sons of Henry McCioy. of
693 ThirtyVfifth , street,*" waa passing near
the home, of Carl Goertz, : the janitor, of
Gier's Hall, who lives : . at ,791 Thirty
seventh street; shortly after 3 o'clock thte
afternoon, when' without 4 .: warning two
shots rang out in a shed at the rear of
the Goertz : house..' With a scream ;of
pain. Deck fell to the ground, with blood
pouring from a- bullet hole in his shoulder.
As he lay on the ground two more' shots
were fired, one of the bullets striking a
telephone pole nÂ«ar where Deck 'had
fallen and the other burying itself in
the house of Edward T. Letter, a con
tractor, who resides at 3615 West street.
By this time Deck's companions were
shouting to the hidden pistol wielder to
cease firing, and thÂ». shooting suddenly
ceased. The two boys secured assist
ance, the wounded boy was taken
home and Dr. J. L. Milton was called to
attend him. The doctor found that the
bullet had been, deflected from a direct
line by the bones of the shoulder, and had
lodged near the sDlne. Had it riot been
for the change in the course of the bullet,
the boy would have been fatally wounded.
The case was reported to the police and
an investigation was made by Detective
Jyte. All members of . the Goertz family
denied any knowledge of the shooting,
and the Identity of the guilty party has
not yet been learned.

PRETTY VENTURA GIRL WHO BE
CAME A BRIDE AT SAX RAFAEL
- TESTERDAT.
SENATOR MORGAN
AGAINST PRESIDENT
Opposes Administration's Sot
liition of Rail Rate
Problem:
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Can.
; WASHINGTON, Nov.' 19.â Senator" Mor-"
gan ut Alabama, the most outspoken
member of . Congress, opposes the latest
proposal by the administration for the
solution of the problem of Federal regu
lation of railroad rates. This proposal
was made by Senator Knox of Pennsyl
vania in a speech delivered at Pittsburg
on November 3. Senator Knox's ideas have
been accepted : by the administration and
will be embodied in the annual message
which tho President will send to Congress
on December 5. -It'Js a r compromise and
tlie administration's admirers are already
proclaiming that the railroad rate fight
is as good as won. But an answer to Sen.
ator Morgan's views: of Senator Knox's
suggestion probably will 6e necessary be
fore the Senate and | House j will be satis
fied that the proposal which Is to' be rec
ommended by Mr. Roosevelt will meet
the requirements of the situation.
"Have you examined the speech of Sen
ator. Knox at Pittsburg on November 3,
in which he vindicates the -President's
policy as to railroad rate legislation?"
Senator Morgan was asked. He replied:
Yes, I have examined it with, some care, but
I am In doubt whether/Mr." Knox's purpose Is
to vindicate tho President's policy or. to Induce
him. to change It,' or to satisfy tho railroads
that nothing of practical importance to them
or the people can ever result from its enact
ment, into a law of Congress. His argument Is
well adapted to either purpose.
'But Mr. Knox undertakes to state and de
fend the position of the President. In his open
ing paragraph he states the President's atti
tude thus: "The President believes the power
to pass upon thÂ« reasonableness of a challenged
railroad ra'e or practice . should . be lodged in
somo tribunal In which can \u25a0 be also constitu
tionally : cast : the . power- to fix h reasonable
rate or, practice in lieu of the rate found by it
toj be unreasonable, and that the rate so flxÂ«d
should become as nearly .immediately operative
as possible." .
He states the . President's view- as be s*es it
and then - proceeds to defend It, or rather to
reconcile it to the railroads. ..My. most earnest
objection to his ., proposed law .is that ,It de
stroys the right of trial by Jury in suits or on
complaints that Involve the question. ot the Jus
tice and reasonableness of railroad rates.

To find "out for a certainty
whether or not your heart fe
affected. One person in four
has a weak heart: it may be
you. If so, you should know
it now, and save serious con-
sequences. If you . have short
breath, fluttering, palpitation,
hungry spells, hot flushes;- if
you -cannot lie on left side;" if
you have fainting or smother-
ing spells, pain around heart,
in side and arms, your heart is
weak, and perhaps diseased.
Dr. Miles' Heart Cure will re- .
lieve you. Try a bottle, and
see how quickly your condition
will improve. ' ,
"About . a year. : ago I wrote to the
Miles Medical C0..- asking advice, as I
was suffering with heart trouble, and
had _ been Â»for two years. I had pain
In my heart, back and left, side, and
had < not : been â¢ able vto - draw a deep
breath for- two years. Any little exer-
tion " would cause ' palpitation. - and I
could not lie ' on my left side without
suffering. They advised me to try Dr.
Miles Hwrt Cure and Nervine, which
>I -, did * with \u25a0. the result that I am in
better health than I ever was before,

Putting Ships
Into Shape
Milwaukee Will Be
the Pride of
New Trio.
The three big cruUers at the Union
Iron Works are fast staring comple
tion. It will be only' a short time be
fore they will become valuable acquisi
tions to Uncle Sam's already great
fleet of dogs of war. The protected
cruiser Milwaukee will be the first to
'cc ::::lshed. She will bÂ« ready for hex
yial trip early In April. She is an en
larged vessel of the type of the Olym
p:a, whose career so far has given
treat satisfaction. The Milwaukee is
built on practically the same lines as
the Olympla. The work on the arm
ored cruisers California and South Da
kota, is being rapidly pushed and their
trial trips will follow aoon after that
of the Milwaukee. These three pow
erful boats present a formidable ap
pearance as they lie almost side by
side at the docks of the Iron works.
Fills Himself With Whisky.
Tom Curry, 61 Xatoma street, drank
twenty-one big drinks of whisky In
less than an hour yesterday. As a re
sult he was laid out llat and came near
shuffling on" this mortal coil. But for
the prompt remedies up-lied by Dr. Q.
X.. Herzog Curry would undoubtedly
be now adorning a. slab sit the Morgue.
Curry started out with the intention
of having: a "good time." He began
and ended his fun in a 6aloon near the
corner of Xatoma and Second streets.
Hero he encountered some friends and
the booze began to flow like water,
jjome one In thÂ« crowd said that Curry
was a slow drinker. Curry, to dis
prove this assertion, began to pour
down wEisky as fast as the glasses
could be set up and as long as his
swallowing capacity lasted. At the
conclusion of the twenty-nrst glass he
(ell senseless to the tloor. His com
panions carried him home and then
telephoned for medical assistance. Dr.
Herzog hurried to the scene. Curry
was almost gasping his last breath
when the doctor arrived. A stomach
pump was brought Into play and after
an hour's hard work Curry was
brought back to consciousness.
Chinese Have .Yarrow Escape.
The Chinese junk Long Chow came
nearly beine wrecked on Shag rock yes
terday afternoon. She was coming: down
the bay from the vicinity of Baden, when
she was struck by the strong southwest
wind with such force that her head tear
and rigging were carried away. The-fwo
Chinamen on board dropped the anchor,
but the ebb tide was running strong at
the time and the boat was carried onto
the rock. Waves washed completely over
the frail craft. The Chinese set uo a
terrible howl, and waved their hats with
great viyor. Harry Johnson . happened
to be pasing at the time with his launch.
Anna. H., and went to the rescue of the
junk and her occuoants. He towed them
away from their perilous position and
lauded them on the mud flats.

The gasoline launch Ryer Island made
her trial trip yesterday, and proved her
self eminently successful to her builder,
\u25a0\Villiaxn Cryer. In her run around the
bay she averaged twelve knots an hour.

RAIN MOISTENS
THIRSTY EARTH
Welcome Storm Softens the
1 Parched Soil of Northern
Counties, Passing Inland
SHOWERS"-' -'FOB- TO-DAY
Forecaster Says That Um
brellas x May Be Needed
at Times Before Night
The rain clouds played a teasing game
with San Francisco :\u25a0 and the northern
part of the State yesterday. Just enough
moisture was dropped around the "city
to make the parched earth' feel the tor
tures of Tantalus. Farther north and
in Oregon, Washington and. Idaho the
thirsty acres fared better.
The little drops of water were a god
send in the regions where they fell. The
land has been baked to the consistency
of asphalt and Is sorely in need of mois
ture to soften it for plowing. In Marin
and Mendocino counties there has been
almost a water, famine." Forest fires have
been raging unchecked and town reser
voirs have been depleted: of their. Â«up
plies. .'\u25a0.-â¢
The thrice welcome storm is ; raging in
land. Assistant District Forecaster Wil
son says , that j light showers : may. fall ' to
day in its track. But most of the moist
ure is belnsr rushed far into\the> interior
to the thirsty cattle lands. A high north
westerly wind off the- coast of Oregon
and the fact that the barometer, is rising
rapidly from San Francisco north, show
that. .
Southern California did not reap any
of the benefits of the storm. Parched.
Nevada only received passing showers.
This city got just enough to fill up the
chuck holes' in the streets and set traps
for Â» the \u25a0 unwary. Twice during the day
it made trouble for the foolish virgin
who weat forth with the picture hat and
no umbrella. Many a milliner's creation
that loomed up like a florist's window in
the morning looked like a flapjack passed
through a" wringer before night.
Forecaster Wilson said last night:
"The storm has passed inland. : It it
pretty well over now. There may be
some showers to-morrow, but they will
be light."
RAIN LATEST IV THIRTY YEARS.
Record Kept Since 1576 Prtves Record
of Three Decadett Broken.
OAKLAND, Nov. 19.â The", record of
thirty years and probably more was
broken to-day when the first rain 1 of
the year fell In Oakland. Never be
fore within the memory of the oldest
inhabitant, and certainly not within
the time that records of the rainfall
have been kept, has the dry season
lasted as lons as It has this year, and
when the first scattering drops fell
this afternoon they were hailed with
delight by every one.
. Ever since the winter of 1876 Wilbur
Walker has kept a record of the first
rainfall of each year,, and this record
proves that never in the last thirty
years has the first precipitation, been
so long delayed.'
" Following is Mr. Walker's record for
the last thirty years:

SUBURBANITES' FEARS ALLAYED.
Rain Welcomed In Marin Because
Water Supply Was Getting Short. .
SAN RAFAEL, Nov. 19.â The long
looked for rain made its appearance here
at 9:30 this morning. It came down in
gentle showers for a short time and then
quit and the sun came out. This even
ing it began falling again. From present
indications the rain has come to stay a
few days. The showers will do much
good, as moisture was greatly needed by
the water company, dairymen and farm
ers. The water supply of Ross, San,An
selmo, San Quentin, Kentfield and this
city was becoming very low and the sit
uation was disturbing, to say the least.
The water in the reservoir of the Marin
County Water Company had got far
below its former lowest point because of
the long dry spell and the increased de
mands for water caused by the healthy
growth of the territory* supplied.
MILL VALLEY,'; Nov. 19.â Rain began
falling here at 10 1 this morning. . It was
welcomed by everybody except a few vis
itors who were compelled to forego a
journey in^o the woods. Many who - had
started on a trip to Redwood . or! Tamal
pais turned back, and with dripping
clothes boarded the next train for their,
homes.
FARMERS NOW CHEERFUL.
Xortb and Central' Part of State Gets
a Wetting.
SANTA- CRUZ, Nov. 19.â Rain fell this
afternoon all over this , section of ; the
county and in the- Santa Cruz Mountains.
This is the first rain that Santa Cruz has
had since June 16, when a slight shower
fell along the shores/ of. Monterey" Bay.-
The rain to-day was especially welcome,
as there had been great danger in nhe
hills from forest fires, which have already
destroyed > thousands of dollars ' worth of
timber this fall.

NEW COMPAN Y AT THE TIVOLI
IS A WELL SELECTED ONE.

GO MIC OPERA
IS WELCOMES
Imported Gast/ Is
Well % Receiyed
by Crowd.
Comic opera was given an enthusiastic
welcome home at the Tlvoli last ,'nlarht.'
The management can shake ; hands .with
itself, for it has gathered together . for
this season as well balanced a company
as the Tivoli has ever h.ad. â¢
"The Highwayman" has not as many
songs that : ; linger with you 'as other
Smlth-De Koven operas, but : It Is : tune
ful ' and catchy ". throughout. There are
no budding - Alice Neilsens or; 'Jessie
Bartlett ;Davlses in the" Tivoli troupe
â¢lther, but most of them will do nicely,
thank you. , '.*>â¢ ;
Helena Fredericks, the Tivoll's new
leading lady has a pretty voice. T
.' Cora Tracy, the ; new' contralto, was not
given many opportunities,' but she showed
that ' she is one of those novelties that
will last. Before the season ; is : over the
Tlvoll ; habitues will ' become deeply; at
tached to Miss Tracy. Her voice is deep
and rich. ' : .
They have annexed a prize in the shape
of a sbubrette, a email one in bulk, but
with life, vivacity and magnetism enough.
Her name is Linda de Costa. If she has
not unpacked all her trunks, she; might
as well get busy to-day, : for they want
her at the Tlvoli. "
There are two' old friends in the gather
ingâArthur Cunningham and ; Teddy
Webb. The audience said "hello" to
them vigorously when they "made their
entries.
Cunningham sang the dashing musical
songs allotted to him by the score for all
that they, are -worth. His ; voice has Im
proved as his birth has? increased.-;
Teddy had plenty of the" center, of the
stage. . After . the annual bout with the
classics the Tlvoli habitues wanted some
thing to grin at and Teddy made good.
Since Ferris Hartmann has become the
"man behind" in real life, Teddy Is king
at the Tivoli. "The king is dead, long live
theÂ»king."
The newly imported, laugh-maker,
George Kunkel, was also-ftmong those
who .won a . home. . Eugene ."Wiener, the
new tenor.. hardly had a chance to show
all that he may be able to do. . v
Our own domestic chorus ; did not loom
up half badly beside the imported talent.
One, of the between-act critics, waxing
overpatriotic, declared that- they over
shadowed the stellar section, but of course
that was Just a little superfluity of pat
riotism.
The fact that nobody seems to over
shadow, the rest is probably due to the
fact that "The Highwayman" is so evenly
distributed that there is no ohance for it.
, ; The five new turns, at the Orpneum
pleased the patrons â¢\u25a0 ot the yaudeyilie
jiouse, last ; night; ; and. ,- together, 1 with ? jthe

ated considerable. amusement, and an,im
itation of. Charles Warner In his delir
ium ; tremens scene from Emile Zola's
"Assomoir," which is, however, a little
too realistic for people with sensitive
nerves. , * V
The Indian snake dance,: shown in 'Mr.'

"Tales of the Desert" is weird ' and 1 in
teresting,- and the colored pictures of life
and scenery on the Arizona ' dry lands
are works of art. Trobar a- Juggler and
equilibrist, does about what he ' pleases
with a heavy cannon-ball; and projectile,
even to letting them fall , on^ the ; back of
his neck,' which ; sends ; thrills up : arid
down the spinal column of the audience.
Lucy and : Lucier have a ; bunch of non
sense 'to offer in their sketch, "The
Fool's Errand," and the , male member
of the team is certainly; a ; comical ' mes
senger boy. ; Lawrence \u25a0 Griffith and , his
company give a rather ; clever, playlette
entitled "In Washington's Time,", but the
company is somewhat amateurish, .. or
else the lines need to be revised." The
Fadette Â»Woman's : Orchstra,^ directed by
Caroline , Nichols,^ played four ; delightful
selections, and were compelled to ' respond
to two encores. The cradle' song", by Ell
enberg, 1 with whistling effect, was charm
ingly rendered,; and the descriptive piece,
"The Soldier's \u25a0 Dream." \u25a0. with " : . military
tactics introduced, brought" out /all !- the
patriotism of , : the '\u25a0:? spectators. 1 Marlon
Garson, young and pretty, 4 sang 'several
songs with a' sweet voice that : shows good
training, and she j was \u25a0 well \ received. Joe
Flynn, - "the ' man" 1 behind the book," has
much funny ; talk and ] two or , three ; songs

Men Are Interested, Will
Proceed to Build Railroad
Asa result of 'several conferences held
at the" Palace Hotel during the last few
days. 'the \u25a0 difficulties existing between
Stewart t r Brlce, 'son- of * the late United
States Senator. - Calvin Brice, and thÂ©
other.; directors \ and stockholders of the
Nicaraguan 'Finance and Improvement
Company, . have been - satisfactorily set
tled. > This company, through" Dr. Ernest
Forbes' of > this \u25a0 city, -a year ago secured
from the little Central American republic
a concession to build a railroad frcm Man
agua' to Matasalpa, ; a distance of about
100 ; miles, in consideration of which the
Nicaraguan , agreed to .grant
the company,'' of which Attorney Joseph
D. Redding. is president/- 2.500,000 acree of
land, 1 including all mineral rights and the
exclusive : right -i to import Chinese labor
ers "- Into â¢ the republic. Young Brice was
engaged at . a lucrative salary . to go to
Nicaragua and manage the company's af
fairs; which he: did several months ago.
Shortly -after Brice arrived 'in Nicar
agua,' it is claimed by him that President
Redding attempted to discredit his man
agement "of , the company's Interests and
finally appointed another man to take
his place. ' Brice hurriedly, returned to
this city and 'begarf preparing- a lawsuit
against Redding, who arrived later from
New- York. Interested with Redding and
Brlce in the company are Richard Ho
tallng,, General Woodruff, Colonels Joss
lyn and Koster, Attorney Thomas Bishop,
Frederick Greenwood -and Colonel F. E.
Beck. They were not disposed to have
their ' interests Jin - the - Central American
republic Jeopardized by legislation, and
they ; finally, arranged a conference which
was attended by Brice and Redding.
An ; arrangement was finally reached.
Saturday wherein the company - agrees
to pay; to Brlce a certain sum of money
and" to "also turn. over .to him the conces
sion for the importation of Chinese labor
into the republic '\u25a0'\u25a0
A committee of five was then appointed
to confer. : with James. Dietrich, the Pltts
burg" millionaire, who Is at the head of
another company; that Is building a rail
road, into Nicaragua from. the east, with
a view of consolidating, the two compa
nies that hold . concessions.
If this ; deal ' is effected both roads will
be hurried to completion and will Insure
a .transcontinental - road for Nicaragua.'
The Chinese concession that Brice holds
Is regarded as a most valuable one., for
it - Is estimated â that -at \u25a0 the ; very least
40,000 Mongolians win be necessary to un
dertake the development of the republic's
mineral and -agricultural interests. Brice
has already, entered into negotiations with
a Chinese company that is importing Chi.

ANOTHER RECORD WEEK IN TRADE.
THE improvement in trade noted^a week ago was still further
accentuated last week, which was almost a record breaker.
The expansion in business all over the country was marked.
The bank clearings mounted to the vast total'of $3,439,469,000,
with only thirteen of the ninety cities and towns reporting clearings
showing a decrease. Minneapolis, Louisville and Detroit were the
only important cities showing losses, and these were so small that
they could hardly be termed losses. More wintry weather and the
approach of the Christmas holidays imparted, a pronounced stimulus
to the jobbing and retail trade all over the country, and collections
everywhere were reported prompt. The manufacturing plants re
ported themselves fully occupied, many of them working overtime
to fill their orders, while a scarcity of labor was reported in a number,
of sections. The railways were congested with traffic, and the usual
complaints of the scarcity of cars were heard. The metal markets
were reported very firm, with higher prices for copper, tin and lead,
while silver got up to 64^ cents, the highest price in three years.
The New York dry goods market was so closely sold up that jobbers
in some lines, unable to secure goods from the manufacturers, were
obliged to buy from one another.
All these conditions point to a continuation of the wonderful
wave of prosperity which has been with us for seven or eight years,
and which has not yet shown any signs of having reached its limit.
It will go down into commercial history as the most remarkable
period of good times ever witnessed in the United States. There
is so much money in the country and people are so flush that pro
duction .seems unable to fully satisfy the consumption, except in a
few lines. A large proportion of the American population are living
better than they ever dreamed of, even in their most sanguine hours.
The only disturbing feature of the week was the Russian situa
tion, which kept the money market in an unsettled condition and
illustrated the modern interdependence of nations. Russia has for
some weeks been putting out feelers for a very large loan, which
would probably have been floated a fortnight ago had not this last
disorder burst into flame throughout the distracted empire. All
bourses throughout the world became affected by the Russian con
dition, and as the American situation was additionally affected by
the demands for large amounts of money wherewith to move the
crops, loans continued at high rates, with violent daily fluctuations.
These in turn affected the national stock markets and attracted the
attention of financiers all over the country. Caution in financial
commitments was accordingly observed and the stock market re
flected this condition in erratic movements, being buoyant one day
and depressed the next. All posted men. in Wall street have for
months been predicting another bull movement in stocks, high as
they are, but this Russian outbreak has thrown their calculations
to sea.
It would appear that the general run of stocks are as high as
they ought to be on a dividend basis, and that any further advance
would be dangerous, but the financiers evidently think otherwise.
Tips, however, are being dropped from a number of posted quarters
that the only cause for a further bull movement at this tim? is the
desire of large interests to still further advance quotations in order
that they may unload their liberal holdings of securities upon the
public and thus let the latter carry the load from now on. They
may yet be able to do it if the Russian situation clears. With this
disturbing element eliminated the present is certainly the psycho
logical moment for such a coup, for everybody has money and is
wilHng to spend it, no matter how, if there is half a chance of
turning a profit out of it. In the present optimistic frame of the
public mind an era of reckless speculation would be. an easy matter
to- precipitate, though the result might prove disastrous in the
long run.
Conditions in California are now largely dependent upon the
weather. The prolonged dry spell began to affect some lines of
industry last week. Mines had to close down owing to shortage of
water and the production of electrical power was also menaced.
Pasturage gave out here and there. Plowing was discontinued on
farms in some sections, and apprehensions of a dry winter were
expressed. But it is yet too early for talk of this sort. Some of the
best seasons we have known have followed dry falls and the whole
winter is yet before us. No living man can predict the weathei,
and we may be complaining of too much rain, in sixty days. Mean
while we are doing an active business, with plenty of money in the
banks, labor fully employed, collections good and farm products
bringing excellent prices with one or two exceptions, real estate
active and building operations proceeding on a vast scale, ; hence
forebodings as to the future are unnecessary at present. Sufficient
unto the day is the evil thereof.
SERIOUS PURPOSE PLAYS.
"Iâ* THICAL purpose in drama is made the subject of a symposium
â¢p* of noted players and theatrical managers on a page of the
\u25a0*â ' Philadelphia Public Ledger. The question put for discussion
is whether a serious ethical purpose â a moral lesson, or a fragment
of human experience that uplifts the spectator, is desirable in a play.
The discussion was precipitated by a controversy between â¢ Clyde
Fitch and the Ledger's dramatic critic as to whether the former's
plays contained such purpose. Without trying to settle the dispute
between them, it is noteworthy that Fitch claims that his ambition
and endeavor is always to put that uplift-to-humanity effect in his
work. He laments that he does not always succeed in "getting this
over the footlights."
The net result of the whole page of opinions is just about ,what
his own common sense would tell each individual without his going
to experts for an opinion. A serious play should always have a
serious ethical purpose. That moral quality should not, however, be
obtruded in such a way as to make itself so important that art could
be ignored in its presentation. The stage is not a pulpit, 'and fine
acting is not so direct a preaching of ethics as the pastors give us, al
though it might by the aid of art convey a lesson in conduct too
subtle to be developed in any sermon. Then there are plays that are
rightly not intended to be serious. They are to amuse. It may be
said that just to amuse is, in a sense, a serious purpose, for it is a
need of humanity, and no doubt the Creator gave us laughter for a
serious purpose. Some of the players point out to us that' even the
portrayal of crime, if done artistically true to nature, has a serious
ethical purpose; and also that the representation of heartrending
griefs is of ethical usefulness, for they lift us from self-satisfaction
or self-pity to heights of sympathy for our fellow-beings.
The public should take note that the players think that the
fault of the plays being not universally up to a higher standard is
attributable to the public's taste. They give us what we call for and
are willing to pay for. Grace George puts it this way: "Dramas of
serious purpose are rated far below par in the theatrical mart, and
for that reason the stage of to-day is not the educator it should be."
As for the manner and method in which plays should be ethical.
Henry Miller expresses it very well when he quotes in regard to this
serious purpose that it should not be "a. round unvarnished tale." The
symposium as a whole would serve as quite an argument for our
need of an endowed theater, where art heed not condescend too
much to seek box-office results.

REMARKABLE TWINS.
Born the same day, married the same
day and so much alike that their own
husbands are only able to tell them
apart by means of their wedding rings,
Mrs. Thomas Evenden and Mrs. Charles j
Allen of Bondurant find themselves for j
the first time in their lives sleeping in.;
separate rooms and under different
roofs, says the Sioux City, lowa, cor
respondent of the St. Paul Dispatch. |
The startling similarity of the "Hall j
twins," as they have been widely,
known, has* long been an object of i
much curiosity in Central lowa. Not !
only did they come into the world on |
the same day and in the same hour, but j
they were baptized the same day, start
ed to schoolthe same day, donned new
dresses and new hats on the same day i
and were always | scrupulously careful 1
to have their wearing apparel exactly j
alike to the veriest detail. Their
parents, Mr. and Mrs. A; E. Hall, christ
ened them Mamie and Minnie, but were,
always at the mercy of the girls when
it came to identifying them. If one was :
to be favored over the other the other-
Invariably secured' a compromise by ,
stoutly maintaining that it was she
whom they really intended to favor,
and that her sister was temporarily an
impostor. So, too, when It came to ad
ministering . reprimands and '.' punish
ment. The offender had but to say it
was her sister who .was the culprit
and start an argument between them as
to who had given offense to cause a
permanent suspension of hostilities. ,
When they wanted to be' god'they
wore different styles of ties and; dif
ferent -rings :.so \u25a0 as to enable their
parents to differentiate.
When they became, old enough to
have' suitors the aspirant for the favor
of either of the twins found himself at
the mercy of the other. If the : latter
Insisted that she was the one he -was
wooing he was unable to successfully
argue the point. Consequently they
forced, their, suitors to Â« come in pairs, !
and, so long as* both' were thoroughly,
satisfied, they wore their rings and ties
in such a manner as to enable: the
young men to which \ was Mamie
and.which Minnie. . .
An unfortunate mix-up was narrowly
averted at the; altar last Wednesday,
when the" double marriage' took 'place
that separated them: for the first; time
in their Â» lives. : Their trousseaus "were
exactly alike, and the minister, and. re-j
Bpective grooms had to take ; their,words
for it" as ,to' whichV they were:'marry

the grooms feared a practical joke.

NEW WOMAN AND THE OLD.
A WOMAN who was New once met
v a woman | who was Old, and , after
she had nulled down ' her vest â¢ and
adjusted , her cravat- carefully she looked
at the . latter woman ' somewhat super
ciliously.; r
"So you .are a woman of the old style,
â¢reyou?"' she said.'
: "I trust that I. am," the woman that
was Old responded, with a pleasant
smile.
""Weil, I : am a New "Woman, I would
have you understand. I have devoted my,
I life to teaching my poor sisters how
they are crushed- and trodden under the
ruthless heel of Brute Man."
"Have they seemed to grasp the idea?"
.â¢'Well,' not as entirely as I .could wish,
but I live in hopeâ l live w in hope. And
from the platform, again and again,' I
have denounced the. tyranny of Man, and
have - declared that , he must sink to the
level where his selfish brutalism places
him."
"Has he sunk any, so far as you have
observed?" \u25a0\u25a0'\u25a0
"Well, no: I cannot say that he has,
but I live in . hopeâ l live in hope." .
"I cannot see that your Newness has
accomplished so much." -.
"Perhaps not, but I live in hope. And
what have you accomplished?"
j "I have loved and helped my husband.
I hayÂ« reared four children, and two of
them are good and useful men and citi
zens and two of them are women of
whom any mother might be proudâ l
guess that is ail." ;
"It is strange." the New Woman re
marked," "how some women are joined to
their idols!" ; ,
But . two men who had heard the con
versation drew- near to the woman who
was Old, and one of them placed his arm
about her on the 'one side and said "My
vlfe!" and the other placed his arm about
her on the : , other side and said "My
mother!" and there was infinite tender
ness in their voices.
And the New Woman still is wondering,
but there is something that G % od planted
in the heart of the Old Woman which
will not permit her to wonder in the
least. v
HE CARED FOR HIMSELF.
He cared for himself as he Jogged along,
And he cared npt a whit for another,
For he never had heard the celestial , song
That rings in the words "My brother."
Yet he sometimes paused to wonder a bit
-Why. his heart and his soul were lonely,
But never he changed his creed a whit:
"Myself,, and my Email self only."
'%-.Â»*?Â£ . :â¢ ..---.:'.\u25a0, .. - i
But he died one dayâ for we all must
\" c sleepâ . "\u25a0-.,'. ; '
With a soul to mourn him never, ;
For the people cried, "Now, why should
. we weep '
For the one who spurned us.ever?"
And I'd sooner be the veriest clod, \u25a0
Loathed by the world, and lonely.
Than he who sleeps 'neath the senseless
â¢ sod,
And who cared for his small self only.

MIRROR OF DAME FASHION
A "VERY BKST" FROCK FOR THE MISS OF 15.
SIMPLE lines are best liked for the misses' frocks, but any suggestion of
severity should be avoided and sufficient freedom of outline provided
for to lend grace to this somewhat awkward age. The Illustration is
a smart model developed in Alice blue henrietta. the skirt made In box pleat
panels, between which is set a shaped flounce. The bodice shows an effec
tive application of hand embroideryâ one of the features of this season's
fashions, and one which, by the way. Henrietta Is splendidly adapted to.
A double collar of the cloth Is finished on the edge with a double ruffle
done in scallops in a darker shade of silk, with a tiny line of gold cord
following the outline. A. vine; pattern In the dark blue silk, with touches
of gold edges the collar, and this appears at the top of the stock and on
thetbands that encircle the sleeve at elbow height. Straps of dark blue
velvet ribbon of the shade of the embroidery silk outline a vest effect in
the front and cross below the shoulder blades In the back, the ends con
fined under a narrow girdle and sash of the same velvet. The finishing
touch of elegance in this costume lathe footwear, the hosiery 'a stripe of
a light and dark blue, and the shoes shiny leather pumps tied with bows
of the velvet.
LEARN HOW TO LOAF
Dorothy Fenimore.
A RETIRED army officer has dis
covered, upon returning to Amer
ica after a two years' sojourn in
Europe, that in his - absence from
home he " has ; become expatriated â not
from a lack' of "patriotism from his na
tive land, but because he Is unable to
find in^the United States company for
his. Idle' hours.
Now he is on his way back to Europe,
where there are other scientific loafers
like himself.
By forty-five hard years in the army
he has earned, he feels, a right to loaf.
And as a friend of his has put it, while
this: is the greatest land that the sun
shines on as long as you keep working:,
it's no atmosphere- to loaf in.
How far right he is we all of us
know who now and then take a day off,
and try to spend it in scientific or
artistic loafing. There's nobody to loaf
with. Every one is too busy â making
money or spending it â to have any time
to loaf and Invite their souls.
We know how to work in America, to
work magnificently, Tltanlcally. But
we don't know how to live. We spend
our precious 'youth with our noses to
the grindstone and get so nearsighted
doing it that when, our labor finished,
we lift our eyes to take a panoramic
view of . the world about, we find our
selves too blind to see any farther than
the grindstone. '"_ _
I have become old enough to look
with appreciative longing back to that
time when . I had seen eight summers
only, and puddles In . the roadway were
such a temptation to my lagging feet
that it took me half an hour to walk
one block 'on my way home from
school.
For sometimes now I get in so Im
patient a mood, in my eagerness to
get ahead toward . a goal which lures
me on, no less because it is but dimly
comprehended, that even at grand
opera I feel annoyed because the actors
keep me, and the rest of the audience,
waiting, so long while they stand
around and sing.
'The man who cannot be* left; alone
with his thoughts is a characteristic
American type.; You all know him. On
the railroad he buys a paper or a maga
zine. Left alone in the evening he
plays solitaire. Anything but think.
I have seen this sort of man In
Europe. Rarely does he find the con
solation In exile 'which ; apparently re
conciles "our retired army officer to it.
In .:.â¢ his 'peregrinations ; , ln . search '<â¢ of
pleasure he looks more lonely than does

cialist:;
a solitary horseman on a snowy coun
try road. And not unlike him in rest
lessness Is the plutocratic but uncul
tured American woman, whose career
across continents resembles the undu
lating, capricious flight of birds.
How fortunate Is one who has loafed
wisely in the impressionable days of
youth, who has kept alive within hi*
breast a capacity for companionship, v
receptivity to the white fervor of faith,
the warm rapture of pure and simple
joy!
Think what a blessing it is to have
a quiet hour at the close of a busy day.
when one may- stand still, and. proud
and self-contained, like an Island in
the midst of the current, reveling In
memory in the delicate wlldness of a
bit of clover, tangle, : in a white mist
that lingers over river meadows.
What an Incomparable pleasure to
stop in the rush of affairs for a mo
mentary recollection of the charm of a
cloistered garden. mossgTOwn amid Its
wealth of transplanted flowers, or thÂ«
beauty of poppy fields undulating their
slow ' way up the hillside.
If you don't learn to loaf when you'rÂ»fc
young, you will never learn how. Whej^
you have made your fortune you arÂ«
not going to be perfectly happy spend
ing It In Europe among other loafers,
for you will be too American for that,
Besides, when you have worked too
long 1 and too hard without relaxation,
you lose ability to enjoy, to appreciate.

The deparment of education of the
California Club. Mrs. Alice L. Park
chairman, has issued the following cir
cular to every county suoerintendent of
bchools in the State, in pursuance of the
Intelligent and vigorous campaign being,
carried on in the way of humane educa
tion:
Ttaa school law of California has had for
four years provision for humane education as
enÂ« of the statutory studies for all public
schools, primary and grammar. It reads as
follows: _ -
"Instruction must be given in the following
branches in the several grades In which they
may be required, viz.: â¢ â¢ â¢ Humane edu
cation; provided that Instruction in humane
educaxion may be oral, no' text books on this
subject being required to be purchased by the
pupils; provided, further, that county boards
ot education may, in districts having- less
than lou census children, connne the pupils to
â¢ â¢ â¢ until they have a practical knowledge
of these subjects^ â paragraph entitled 'Stat
utory School Studies,' " No. 1665, Political
Code.
That is, humane education is compulsory In
â¢11 primary and grammar schools having more
than IUO census children In the district. â¢
This circular is addressed to the school of
ficers and to tha echool teachers of California,
respectfully reminding them of the provisions
of the school law, and requesting them to ob
serve its letter and spirit.
Hon. T. J Kirk, State Superintendent of
Public Instruction, said in a letter dated Au
gust 29. IJKC, "You may announce that I
heartily recommend that humane education
be made a topic for discussion at all our
county teachers' Institutes,"
Many superintendents have placed humane
education on the Institute programmes, and
many teachers have been mindful of this Im
portant subject, especially since the law was
passed In 1901. The best educational period
icals give deserved prominence to humane
topics. ' ;'
It is believed that a regular time . on the
weekly programme, as is provided by law in
several States, would be aa aid toward more
and better work In thle subject. It is recom
mended that stories of kindness (to animals be
placed in the school libraries; that pictures for
decoration of school rooms be carefully chosen;
that an annual bird day In the spring and an
annual peace day in May be approved by coun
ty sui>erintendenta of schools.-
Humane education implies a step beyond ani
mals' rights. It lmplfes character building.
Society first said that needless suffering should
be prevented. Society now says that children
must not be permitted to cause pain, because
of the effect on thÂ« children themselves.

HEBREWS MOURN
THE MASSACRED
Hold Memorial Services in
Wliicli Jvumerous Kussian
Israelites Also Take Tart
GENTILES GIVE FBEELY
Eev. David Evans and Dr. G.
0. Adamsllake Appeal and
Worshipers Contribute
Memorial services in honor of the
massacred Jews in Russia were held in
the Congregation Keneseth j Israel Syna
gogue, Russ street, near Folsom, yester
day afternoon. Most ;of the people
present were from that part of Russia
where tho massacre Xwas at its height
and most of them believe they have lost
many friend 3 and relatives during the
recent atrocities. . \u25a0
The synagogue was draped in black
and prominent citizens addressed the
congregation. Rev. Jacob Voorsanger
asked his hearers not to stop after ex
pressing their sorrow because of the
dead but to take steps to protect the
living. Congressman Julius Kahn and
several other speakers of prominence
also addressed the congregation. At the
close of the service a collection was taken
up for the suffering Jews in Russia.
The Rev. David Evans, rector of Grace
Church, California street, corner or
Stockton, made a touching appeal on be
half of the families of j the massacred
Jews in Russia at , the morning service
yesterday. In part Mr. Evans said:
It ts required of us as Christians that we'
should do something to voice our horror at the
appalling tragedy which, during the past week
and longer, has been enacted, and. â¢ for all we
know. Is still proceeding In the cities of South
ern Russia, where at least 3000 Jews^have
been barbarously massacred and at leaat 10,WW
maimed for life.
ATTITUDE OF POWERS.
That there has \u25a0 been no remonstrance made
by the United States or any other country iÂ»
due no doubt, to a natural reluctance to em
barrass an administration that has cares and
perplexities enough already. But the church
holds a different position " and need not be
Impeded by any political considerations. .
Here is an opportunity for federated Chris
tianity of a practical sort.
These thousands of Jewish lives . have been
sacrificed, remember, on the bloody altar of
religious fanaticism and in the name of Christ.
80, Just because we are Christians ourselves, we
ought for the sake of our fair Father Christ.
by these fanatics so horribly blasphemed, to
help heal the wounds of the victims of this
modern massacre of St. Bartholomew. _
Resolutions of sympathy are meet and right,
but tlwy carry more weight when tangible and
concrete generosity -goes with them. -
The Rev. Mr. Evans. asked the congre
gation to place its offerings for the relief
fund In the boxes by the door as they left
tti"e church.
The appeal of the rector was generously
responded to and the * amount will be
handed by tho Rev. Mr. Evans to the
treasurer of the relief fund, Philip N.
LilienthaL
The Rev. George C. Adams, pastor of
the First Congregational Chucrh, 'Post
street, corner of Mason, made a strong
appeal to his large congregation yester
day morning for aid toward the fund be
ing raised for the Jewish sufferers In the
Czar's realm.
JUDEA GAVE CHRISTIANITY.
Dr Adams declared that Christianity I
would never have been but for Judaism.
The Jewish church made the Christian
church possible, said the doctor, and the
Christians' Saviour was a Jew. v , \u25a0 s \u25a0 â¢
The Jews, he said, are exceedingly, lib
eral and do not confine their, liberality to
their own race. \ ,
The doctor then spokÂ© of i the terrible
atrocities in Russia' and the fact that the
unreasoning hatred of the people who are
rising vents itself on the Jews. In view
of this, Dr. Adams urged his congregation
to send â¢to the First Congregational
Church treasury any amounts that they
could contribute and he in turn would
remit to the treasurer of the relief fund.
By evening a goodly sum was received
at the church, one of the congregation, a
prominent business man of the city, send
ing a handsome donation.

MEYER LEADS HIS CLUB
Kington Outshoots Big Field
With the Revolver W r hile
Hammond Scores 69 Rings
The members of the California
Schuetzen Club and' of the" Grutli
Shooting section turned out In-.num
bers yesterday to compete for prizes
on the- bullseye targets. They, also
entered into competition with their
fellow club members to, make a- high
score/which would ; enable them to
carry home a fat turkey asa mark of
their prowess at the targets. This is
the time of the year that all the rifle
clubs offer inducements to their mem
bers to face the bullseye and place a
good score to their credit. .
In the bullseye contest of the Cali
fornia Schuetzen Club Chris Meyer was
high man with the excellent center of
thirty-nine points.; This is the best
center made this year and no doubt
will stand as the highest record. So
near was the shot that all onlookers
believed it was a. true center. When
the micrometer machine determined its
location all were satisfied it would re
main high for a long time.
E. Hammond was the member who
led all his comrades \u25a0 in . the turkey
contest by making the good score of
sixty-nine rings in his three-shot en
try, although he was one of 120 com
petitors. â¢ . . ,
In the pistol target contest F. V.
Kington was the leader, with ninety
four and ninety-five rings out 01. a pos
sible 100.
In the bullseye shooting of the
Grutli Club A. C. Gehret distinguished
himself by making fifteen bullseyes
out of a possible twenty. This is one
of the best records made: at a. bullseye
shoot for a long time and the clear
eyed marksman was congratulated by
all his comrades.
The scores made on the bullseye tar
get of the California Schuetzen Club
follow:
C. Meyer 39 points, A. Hintemann 120. G.

the. decision: of the Pope to appoint the

lari, a cardinal, has not been altogether

Venetian,^ namely, Monsignor Callegari,
Bishop of Padua. > â¢
â¢ It is said that the late Pope- Leo XIII
favored all the clergy of Perugia, where
he was Archbishop for many years,' thus
forming a famous group called the Peru

first game in eleven': innings by a~ score
of 2 to 1, and tieing the j second, the
game being- called at the" end :6f the
seventh Inning with the .score, stand
ing 1 to 1. Both; games were full of
fast, sensational fielding ,. by : . both
teams. The first 'was a great battle
of pitchers , between Shields , and - "W.
Hall, the local man having, the best of
it. j He allowed but; two . hits in eleven
innings. Brashear 7 got a home rim in
the seventh .'inning of the first arid
Cravath putahe ball over the fence in
the sixth inning of the' second-game,
which gave the locals a draw. \u25a0 Nagle
started in 'to pitch the second j game,
but when Umpire ' Davis put Flood'; and
Smith out of \the.game Dillon with
drew Nagle, â¢ not wishing him ;to "risk
breaking his long series-.of victbrles
with a patched up team behind /him.
Goodwin finished, .the game. <"â¢;\u25a0 â¢ '/
*The ill-feeling which is said to have
existed between Umpire Davis and ;Tlm
FlJ>od for a long time broke "out to-day,
and resulted in Flood assaulting'Da
vis. In the first inning of \u25a0 the;second
game Davis called a â¢â¢baH" jon Nagle.
The spectators protested against the
decision. Flood, according to the play
ers, said to Davis: "Why aon't you call
'em when Uhey're over?". Turning: td
Flood, Davis said: "Five for you -and
you're out of the game."-, ' .. _c; -
.Flood; threw his glove iatÂ»;the>Jirnpire
and before any of the /fleiderÃ^could
interfere rushed upon him arid -swung
three terrific left hand blows C 6ri Davis',
face. Davis ran in order .^'ltoj \u25a0'.; avoid
Flood and the other players imriiediate
ly /interfered. In' : the melee .' Davis
claimed- Smith also struck .him. -but
this could not be seen from .the "stand."
Flood was arrested and taken -\u25a0 to', the
police station, where he was bailed.^out
by Attorney Earl Rogers. Smith i, was'
put out of the game. . '_ As a" result of
the row FloQd probably will not 'be

to-day^to be examined not only patholog

has .started afresh the story that she may
have : been $ the : ; victim \u25a0- of .. poison.. While

scratch mark, finished second in the re
m&rkabla time cf one hour and four min
utes. He made up all but two minutes
$f the winner's handicap.
The course Is a heart-breaking one from
Ala Valley to Dipsea on the ocean. It is
Estimated et cine miles, and has an ele
vation at It* highest point of 15S0 feet-
Eighty-four runners started and of these
eeventy-one were checked off at the finish.
Connelly set a terrific pace from the
etaxt and passed all the competitors ex
â¢ cept the flying high school boy.
21ost of the race was coverel In a driv
ing rain, and the thinly clad athletes ran
tinder difficulties. The ground was slip-/
pery and the uncertain footing caused
many falls. The last mile of the race
waa on the firm sand of the beach, and
the runners made brave efforts to hit up
their speed. The majority had friendly,
pacemakers to cheer them on when the
final MtrusglA bÂ«gan. \u0084.___â . +*\u25a0.
The indomitable courage which kept
their tired muscles at work throughout
the desperate struggle forsook many of
the athletes when they had crossed the
finish line and they fell to the ground
helpless. Roger Cornell, the Olympic Club
trainer, and others cared for them in their
distress and soon had them revived. The
collapse In each case was only temporary.
George James, the starter, and Walter
Christie, the University of California
trainer, followed the course of the run
and encouraged some of the men who
misjudged their speed and quickly ran
themselves to a standstill.
Glarner. of the scratch division, sprain
ed hia ankle early in the race, thus
ruining his chances.
A The race was notabla for the brilliant
% showing made by high school boys. Lv
Ti. Thompson of Lick School, who started
from the Sve-minute mark, finished
fourth. His actual time was forty-fivj
seconds faster than that of the winner
who was in receipt of a more liberal
handicap. M. McCourtney, also of Lick,
finished seventh.
The success of the contest, both In its
record entry and in its outcome, is ex
pected to have a strong Influence on
athletics on this coast. It will be used
as an anrument by officials of the
Olympic Club when pleading for outdoor
grounds. It is intended to run a similar
race next year, when it is proposed to
offer a $1000 prize.
Among the Olympians who walked to
Dipeea. to witness the finish were Presi

dell, John A. Hammersmith, Mr. Hlrscb,
Kenneth Melrose, T. I. Fitzpatrick, J. j.
Gleason, Robert Mac Arthur and a host
of others. Messrs. Hammersmith and

in one hour and fifty-five minutes.
A substantial luncheon was served after

Greeted With Cheers as He
Enters Theater in New

NEW YORK, Nov. 19.â Prince Louis of
Battenbers's visit to New York will come
to '\u25a0 an end to-morrow. It was originally
intended that the British \ squadron
should start to-day on its voyage to Gib
raltar, but the time was "extended ow
ing to delay in coaling the ships.:
Prince Louis dined at the University
Club and then, drove to the .New York
Theater, where he was greeted with
rousing cheers, and after he had entered
his box he was obliged to stand and bow
his response to the , noisy I welcome. In a
statement to-night the Prince said:
"Let me say that I consider the demon*
strations given us as entirely directed
toward our country, and J. :< know they
are appreciated. Fpr myself, I; do not
count. I am simply the representative
of my country. I am sure the people of
my country will look upon my kindly re
ception as an honor to the King and
themselves. We . are proud to represent
them, and our only regret Is that ; the
only chance we have had; to return some
of this 'splendid hospitalityâ by ; a
reception -on the \ Drakeâ was â¢ so ; cold In
the supper room' that all our guests. were
'sneezing.-. . .V\j. -':"-':' '"

GOOD HORSES
HAVE A CHANCE
Several Rich Handicaps Are
\u25a0 Down for Decision the
Coming Week at Oakland
RADTKE A FAVORITE
There; should be some Interesting sport
at Oakland this week, as an excellent pro
grammed Is .^offered, Including handicaps
that will ; bring together the best horses
.in training. . -
On the Eddie Jones handi
cap, with a, value of $1000, will bÂ« decided.
It "is at one and a sixteenth miles for
three-year-olds -"and upward. There will
!be two . handicaps Saturday. The Albert
i is for two-year-olds at six furlongs; while
the $1000 Morello is for three-year-olds and
upward . at a mile and a furlong. Other
handicaps ' during the Â» week are the Med
dler on Tuesday, and the Hanover on Fri
day. -- .
President Thomas H. Williams of the
New; Calif ornia . Jockey Club is highly
! pleased at the first seven days', racing. He
! remarked' on Saturday that this will
| doubtless be the banner racing season In
j the history of the sport on the coast. â¢
i It Isn't ao long ago that Teddy Robin
! son, 'who landed Lady Goodrich winner
of the . handicap on : Saturday last by a
nose. -knew more about the working of
an automobile than he did about piloting
j*a^ thoroughbred. Billy ...Cotton's . rider
'learned; the blacksmith 'trade and until
October/ 1904, was in tho employ of the
"Winton Company at Cleveland, Ohio. The
little-: Englishman always had a hanker
ing to become a Jockey, and Cotton finally
consented to give him a chance. With the
opportunity afforded he has made remark
able progress.
. Radtke scored a. hit with the crowds
by his -clever, riding the first seven
days of the season, and is now, a, prime
favorite. , Jack Keene's rider â¢Is . alert
at the barrier and appears to be a good
judge of pace.
â¢ "Blgr Bill" Knapp has ,the same bis
followinsr as of old. There 13 one fault
with â¢ Knapp, and that Is his lack of
discretion 1 in using the whip. It is not
necessary to beat a horse .until ,welt 3
as large \u25a0as a plug \u25a0 hat are raised on
his sides in order', to make* him use
every pound *of reserve 'force. The
trouble of 'it all^isHbat -the. horse pos
sesses more brains and common sense
than the major portion- of. the people
that ride, drive and train him, but he
has no Â« way of communicating that fact
to them. â¢
gg Davis is displaying good formi but
will bo fortunate if , he does not have
one of his mounts disqualified ere long.
When it comes to a tight pinch in the
stretch Willie Is Inclined to take the
contending horse Into the paddock or
the grandstand.
.McÃride; is 'another rider with the
same weakness, of which flne3 and sus
pensions have failed to break him. : ,

Remarkable Kxhlblt ton -ot Association .
Football Takes Place on Free
vai'o Pork Field.
OAKLAND. Nov. 19.â Rain and the
biting cold wind 3 thl3 afternoon kept I
many devotees of association football
from witnessing a game at Freeman's
Park that was one of the cleverest, in
point of Individual work, ever played
on this coast. The Independents of San
Francisco won from the Eagles of Ala
meda by a score of . 7 to 0, but the
poor showing Qf the losers was not
due to poor playing on their part.
With only ten men to kick against the
rugged Independents the Eagles fought
each inch of the ground with Individual
plays that would have brought victory
had it not been for the excellent team
work of .their opponents.
Fred Cr oil of Alameda was the hero
v of the came. Time and again when It
seemed -. certain the Independents had
the ball in the net, Croll almost miracu
lously prevented a score. Five times
in the: first 'half the ball passed vhrnr
and the Independents scored, but It waa
no fault of Croll's. _^It was a case of
team work against Individual skill and
team work and massing of plays won.
The teams were made up of: ..
Independentsâ Antrobua. Milne, Higgett. I'm
land, - Belmand. Harstow, Joiwa, T. Fay, E.
Fay. P. Fay. Hlggins.

HONOR FOUNDER
OF ASSOCIATION
Memorial Services Held by
Local Y. IT! C. A. for the
Late Sir George Williams
Impressive memorial senices were held
in the auditorium of â¢ the- Young Men's
Christian Association, yesterday after
noon, for its founder, the late Sir George
Williams, who died November 6 of this
year arid was buried in St.
Cathedral, London, at-"hoon, \ November
14. A suitable programme had been,ar
ranged for the occasion and the audi
torium was beautifully decorated with
English 'and American flags in honor "of
this noted man..
Rev. Frederick W. * Clampett, D. ) D.;
pastor of Trinity Church, gave the me
morial address and spoke r of .the oer
sonal friendshib which -existed between
him and- the founder of the Y. M. C. A.
for many years. * .During the course of
his address' the ' Rev. Clampett said -in
part: * ...
Sir -George 'Williams, .the founder of . this
great religious body, was a man of consecra
tion. Inspiration ' and 'ah exceptional power of
organization. As a business man he was tin
known and th^.great secret of his feuccess lay
In the sanctity of his', work. He was ever a
man 'of exceptional Kindness and had a great,
love ' for ' the young people, whom he 'always
tried to advance in their religious ' welfare.
OiÂ» June 4, 1844, he organized the first Young
Men's' Christian Association, '.and -when I last
m*t him' he was the leading Epirit at a meet-
Ing of - the association ' in Exeter Hall in the
city of IÂ»ndbn. He lived to see ; his ! work
spread' through Great .Britain and Its colonies,
through' this great '.republic and j its colonies,
and. In fact,, he lived, to see ; its growth all
over the 'civilized world. ,"' T ." ' â¢', \u25a0
> During the last century three great religious
movements have I beenl>rpugtit.-,t6 the/ front,
namely, j that of John TVesley, ' founder <5f the
Methodist church: Ballington, Booth of the Sal
vation Army and Sir George "Williams of the
.Y. M. C.A. The^e three, organizations were
all founded by laymen and deserve the great
est credit for the work they, are doing. The
Y. M. C. A., however, must* be acknowledged
at> the grÂ«'ai''Bt of -them, \u25a0 for-, its work is three
fold, being that of the pplrlt, mlrid and body.
Th<? .adaptability of the. association to the
conditions of all classes of m-in has been the
cause of its rapid growth during Its short ex
iFtencc. It is the only organization that fur
nishes an . attractive . j>l?.ce. where young men
5 can spend their lelsui* hours. . .
After the address of' the Rev. Clam
pett, Henry J; McCoy, general secretary
of the association, gave a short address,
in which he spoke of the great kindness
of Sir George, 'and said, "Ills name will
never perish 'as. long. as. young men serVe
and love the game Master to whom he
gave his life to serve."/ Henry. W.; Davis
also gave a short address upon the life of
Sir George and' spoke of the . great monu
ment he has left behind.'' -;, . ,
At the close of the exercises, H. Digby
Johnston, an elderly" gentleman ex
member of j Parliament, rose'.ln the, rear
of the auditorium and. announced, he had
been a personal friend of Sir; George and
made a brief address. - and " would ,' like

NATIVE SONS' MEMORIAL
IMPRESSIVELY OBSERVED
Sweet Songs by Soloists andVQuartet-SLnd
Eulogies Mark Exercise *
Memorial services by the Native Sons
of the Golden West were held .yester
day afternoon at Native. Sons' .Hall. It
anything, the exercises were even deeper
in sympathetic expression than a year
ago, which was -probably- due to the very
large number . members ,who have!
passed away within the year.
The hall-was not only decorated in har
mony with the solemn occasion, but to
add to the effect the lights were almost
continuously 1 subdued, v ; ' " - ' .
The singing of the, exquisite sacred
songs by the , Knickerbocker Quartet
and the solos by Miss Millie Flynn, Miss
Vive Hickey and L.. A. Larsen seemed
strangely, intense. ' One' beautiful num
ber, "Abide JWith Me,'.'.,, the words to a
new arusicai setting- <by -Fletcher <Hus
bahd.Cwas rendered i by the quartet "with
pathetic feeling. - i---v'l.-: '\u25a0* \u25a0:.
In his invocation, thÂ« Rev.; Herbert E.
Hays pleaded eloquently â¢ for /the . State
and nation's 'welfare ,". praying that right
eousness and- : Justice-V' might prevail
throughout the land. In his allusion..to
those who had J passed \ away- Rev. \u25a0 Mr.
\u25a0Hays' said that those; who survive, them
would be the better and briaver, because of
their having lived. ... -- . . â¢ .
Chairman Charles A.- Koenig's opening
remarks, were, tender in -their recollection
of the.departed.and the ritual ceremony
of the order delivered /by .:-;D. J. Beban,
Dr. ' H._H.'Keene," Jesse C. " Allan and
John Regan 'gave a; deeply, profound at
mosphere to the. ceremonies. .
. DELIVERS EULOGY. â¢
The eulogy was â¢ delivered, by James I*
Gallagher, grand president of the Native
Sons of the Golden West. , He , said /it
was not' possible to speak of each one
who had gone before" them individually;
it were impossible- to tell .'of - all their
generous ' acts, still ' their . lives . and, good
traits \u25a0 were written upon j the hearts of
relatives and friends alike by hands of
love. \u25a0 ' . -.- â¢ " '\u25a0' '. â¢' \u25a0 â¢ \u0084 '; ..; '".", \u25a0.
In relating the virtues of the departed,
Gallagher asked who can ; . estimate the
good the Native Sons of < the Golden West
are doing .for the State. The pioneers,
he said, arejpassing away,; and are leav
ing to them,a most glorious heritage.
Daniel A. Ryan, grand trustee, Native
Sons of the Golden West, in beginning his
oration, said there were two days in the
! year they |observedâ one a day # of gladÂ£
ness and' the other a day of sadness-^
one was 'the' observance of '^ the-continu
ance of the activities of California and
the other that ef the memory ; of their
departed. < . â¢ \u25a0 . . .
He spoke not only, eloquently -but In
the most sympathetic: strains 'of 'their
virtues and , their loyalty to the ;_ State
they loved so dearly.-' ,Thelr voices, he
said, remained; ' they ..: were - remembered
at. the fireside; they ,were;, remembered in
the city's, throngs, arid. 'their, names -arid

Herman' Wickliorst Arrested
While Kobbing Grocery, of
Friend, John A: Heitniann
HERE ONLY TWO WEEKS
Also Ch arged With Entering
Store of Man ito Whom He
Had Note of Introduction
Herman Wickhorst, 19 years of age,
'who here from 'j Germany -- about
two weeks J ago { and cannot speak a word
of^EnKlish, is in the City Prison with
two charges of, burglary against him. He
gives his occupation as a butcher. \ \u25a0
Shortly. after 3 o'clock yesterday morn- ;
ing Policeman E. F. Copeland noticed the
side door leading' to John A. Heltmann's
grocery t and - saloon . at ; 1400 Polk â¢ street
was open.) He made an investigation and
dlscoveredVthat- the glass* in the door
had. been"; broken and the door opened by
pulling the catch. \u25a0- ' .."..\u25a0
\u25a0'\u25a0 Thinking ;, that a burglar might >be on
the premises | Copeland " entered the gro
cery ~ and 'Â» after, making a careful ; search
saw -Wickhorst croubhed behind the coun
ter. * Drawing } his : revolver Copeland or
dered him, to .throw up his hands. The
order was * instantly obeyed. Copeland
found that ;the I cash register ' had Â£ been
forced open and on searching Wickhorst's
pockets he got $18 1 in nickels, 71 one-cent
pieces and ;two watch chains, which .had
been taken from the, cash register, ; also
$3in "silver and a check for $13 22 on the
San Francisco National Â£ Bank. Wick
horst was taken". to the City Prison' and
booked; on a charge of burglary. ; .
About three\ hours later Charles Leh
mann,' shoemaker,- 1437. -Pine street, re
ported to -Copeland j and f W.-
Murphy, that -his store, which is under
his : living] rooms, \u25a0 had been entered â¢ and
a . check for i $13 22 on ' the . San Francisco
National Bank and $3 in coin stolen from
the cash' drawer. ' Another charge of bur
glary, was * accordingly registered against
Wickhorst. 1 . ; -
I A friend of Wickhorst called at the City
Prison yesterday - morning v to see him.
He said that Wickhorst had only been in
this city \tor. about two weeks. He came
here from r Germany, and as he had no
money the friend paid for. his board and
lodging at Heltmann's residence. He was
surprised to /learn 'that Wickhorst had
turned burglar. v The boy's father, he said,
was a wealthy saloon-keeper in Emshorn,
Holsteln, Germany;' and the boy never
had been in any trouble- there. - Wick
horst had told him; that he got drunk
and did not remember anything about the
burglaries." Wickhorst had brought a let
ter of Introduction to Lehmann and had
called there several times.

These remedies have come down to us
- from our mothers and grandmothers, who
have profited by their use -and have had
every confidence \u25a0 therein,^ so we take their
virtues for granted and seldom stop to
consider their purity.
. In this day of commercialism and sub-
stitution, some ignorant and unscrupulous
manufacturers have taken advantage of
this fact, and for. the pure grain alcohol,
which is the basis of most of these spirits
and extracts, have substituted its dan-
gerous namesake "wood alcohol."
~.The reason for this is that wood alcohol
is cheap, costing about 15 or 20 per cent
of the value of the pure grain alcohol, and
â¢by so doing enables the seller to attract
trade by offering pints,- quarts or gallons
at a very small price.
The danger of it is that wood alcohol
is a poison which causes . blindness \u25a0 and
death. It is most distressing, is it not,
to think ; that in some of our medicines
we are buying , that which - will . kill in-
stead of cure ? It is true, however, " and
has been proven by actual occurrence.
Dr. Frank Buller, of Montreal, and Dr.
Casey Wood, of Chicago-, both noted spe-,
cialists, have found through investigation
more than 175 cases of blindness and over
100 deaths for which wood alcohol has
been directly responsible. *

The distinguishing feature of wood a!-^
cohol poisoning is that it attacks the eye
directly, and," even where death does cot
ensue, total blindness is almost invariably
the consequence.
Blindness Hay Kewlt /
Poisoning from wood alcohol may bt
caused' both by its internal use and by,
absorption through the pores or a small
break in the skin. -Think of that . and.
what, it means. One of the children comes]
to you .with a cut on his finger and yooi
apply 1 cheap witch haze) to prevent the
soreness which ' follows. ir* .
..Suppose the witch hazel contains wood
alcohol or formaldehyde, and it is likely t
to do -so, the poison is quickly taken, up'
by the blood, and blindness or blood
poison is sure to, result. >
Your - husband calls j for the bottle of
witch hazel to ease his face. after shaving.*
If the witch hazel b adulterated with
wood alcohol or formaldehyde, think of
the chance for poisoning by absorption
throqgh the freshly opened pores, or a
slight cut left by the razor, and how often
have \u25a0 facial eruptions and serious results
followed acd no realization or suspicion
of the cause. ..
You ' have a -headache and bathe your
forehead with camphor, or ' put a cloth '
dampened with common . extract of witch M
hazel across your eyes. If wood alcohol^
has; takeni the? place of pure alcohol -in
these remedies, and a drop of it gets into
the eyes, total blindness is almost sure to
follow. .- .: ; ~"
Great Chances TaiÂ«a^_
There are a hundred and one ways in
which we use these remdies and* a hun-
dred and one times we take chances of
blood poison and blindness from the wood
alcohol with which they are often adul-
terated.' * . \u25a0 \ . ", \u25a0
Now the question is. What, is to .be'
done? These remedies in their pure state
are hcjpful, necessary and almost indis-i
pensablc in the, home: and we have a!
right to expect them to be pure. .The;
thing we must do is to be sure of their,
purity when we buy them.
When you go into a store to make a'
purchase of this kind call fcr the standard
product of. well-known reputation, and
accept " no substitute, that you "_ may be
guaranteed that it is the pure grain alco-
hol, and .not poison, whicqhas been used
in the manufacture of these articles. . i
zlt rests" with" ydu'as a duty to be surej
that, you 'have the -right proauct, and to
tell others of the danger of using a cheap
substitute; and as the public demands its
rights," those? who. make or sell medicines
which- are not pure realize that they must
make .them pure.'. Always buy. even at a
greater, cost, a standardized article. â N. If-
