Director Campbell
of Lick Holds
This Theory.
Time May Come When
We Can See Humans
on Other Planets.
Inconceivable That the Earth
Alone Should Have Intel
ligent Life.
Special Dl*pÂ«.tch to ThÂ» CaJL
CHICAGO. Nov. 14.â That hunatn belngrs
eii^t and hare' worlds of their own up
among the Â«ars is the conviction of Pro
rrssor VT. TV". Campho*r director of the
freat Lick Observatory in California,
who was at th<Â» Auditorium Hotel to-day
on hia way home from Europe, where he
â¢obferved the total eclipse uf the sun on
Vu?ust 30.
"It is inconceivable to me." he said, in
â¢peaking: of the theory that Mars or other
planets arc Inhabited, "that only one
planrt Or one star Â«lioÂ«ld have intelligent
life, and that the earth is that one. The
doctrine of probability is dead against it,
and there is th? highest degree of proba
bility that there are inhabited worlds
Â»bove us."
Wlien a>kcd if he believed thÂ«- time
ever would cyme TJ-hen science would be
Â».bl>= to solve the problem, and perhaps
actually view the strangers in these mys
rtle worlds among the sparkling heavens
Â«o far away. Professor Campbell an-
Ewered: "...-.\u25a0 ..
"It Is a legitimate cuestioa for the as
tronomer to keep before him. At present
are have no idea how the problem is to
be attacked. We must not overlook the
possibility that telescopes of capabilities
and iÂ»owers now unknown to us may be
Invented,- and that discoveries will be
made as undreamed now as was wireless
telegraphy fifty years ago.
"As to human beings on Mars it is en
tirely possible, though we do not know
that the human animai.' as we know him,
would live in the atmosphere of that
planet, which Is not as dense as that on
the tops of our highest mountains. It is
not difficult to believe, however, that hu
man beings on Mars might be created in
our own image and still have lungs capa
ble of sustaining life there.
"In the present stage of astronomical
Scvdopment we cannot see the actual
'-and of Mars, even with the most power
ful telescope. To be visible to us an ob
ject on Mars would have to be about
twenty miles In diameter." .
Professor Campbell headed one of three
expeditions rent out at the expense of
William 11. Crocker^of San Francisco to
Etudy the recent solar eclipse. Professor
Campbell's party viewed the eclipse from
Albania, Spain. It Is hoped that "study
and a comparison of photographs wTll
add much to science In the way of knowl
edge as to the changes taking place in
v the cun and of its structure, etc.
f^ The professor said he believed the limit
* of power la refracting telescopes had
been reached, substantially, and that the
greatest progress -would be made with
.reflecting telescopes.

of these conditions and feeling alarm at
the condition of Cuba during the coming

This action by the convention Is said- to
represent the opinion of practically > the
entire population of the Isle of < Pines.
At the meeting there was only one voice
raised against the - action taken. That
was by a man who expressed fear, of the
results, asserting that all were liable \u25a0 to
punishment under the Cuban laws.
Fully one-third ""of those now \u25a0 living , on
the Island are American - citizens. There
has been a steady Immigration from the

GOVEBXMEAT REGAINS .\ERVE.
I)f(criuint>Â«l to Itcntorc Order Through
out the Empire.
â¢ ST. PETERSBURG. Nov. 14.â Count
de Witte to-day received from the
Warsaw committee of the Social
Democracy of Poland and Lithuania an
indignant telegraphic denial of the
cliaige that the present movement in
Poland is designed to secure separa
tion. Tlie dispatch said:
The official note justifying the proclamation
or lUitriial law in I'olana as ostensibly lor the
I L.r;.o>- of frustrating a separatist movement
It a criminal maneuver o: tne Government, ln-
Undud to divide the I*olitsh from the Uussian
-revolutionary movement. We call attention to
tbe tact of the authoritiee having drowned our
rtvolutlonary processions In blood and having
allowed full freedom to other Polish demon
strations at which the while eagle was displayed
and wiiero tHenkewitz and other orators
. (liea^ied >vitsi the workmen to return to their
.â¢hops and roFtore peace. We at firm that the
revolutionary Russian proletariat, together with
the revolutionary Kusslan proletariat, seek com
tiion frefdom and not separation.
The Poles here also deny that they
desire separation. M. Menshikoff, in a
strong article, warns the Government
that it would be fa*al to spill the blood
of Poland, arguing that autonomy
could be granted without danger to the
empire and that "with such a solution
Russia, could always count on the pow
erful friendship of the Polish people."
The Novoe Vremya alone, vigorously
supports the Government's fair atti
tude.
It is evident that the Government has
recovered in nerve and Is determined to
use severe measures', if necessary, to
\u25a0 restore order. The agitation through
out the country at the exceptional pow
fcrS conferred on the aids de camp of
the Emperor, who will be dispatched
to the central provinces, where, it is
said, agrarian disorders are spreading,
is proof of this. At the same time half
a dozen Governors, including the Gov
erns of Odessa, Tomsk and Kazan, who
signally failed to prevent disorders,
have been summarily dismissed at
Count de Witte's instigation.
The clergy, with other classes, â¢ con
tinues its intercessions for the Kron
stadt mutineers, 151 of whom are re
ported to have been condemned to
death. A hundred orthodox priests, at
a meeting held at the residence of the
Metropolitan Antonius, formulated and

Urge That Water Holes on
the Desert Be Marked and
Looked After by Rangers
; EL PASO, Nov. 14.â The first day's sesr
sibn ;of .the American Mining Congress,
which met here to-day in its eighth an
nual convention, was devoted to prelimin-'
ary work, "welcoming addresses and com
mittee meetings. The annual address of
President Richards" of Boise, Idaho, was "
the real feature of the day. ,:, '. :
n President Richards made a plea toput
the association on a business basis, and
said , the time had arrived when the or
ganization must cease existing on char
ity. He said he believed a department of
mines and, mining in the President's Cab
inet would be a -great lhelp-i to miners.
He declared ridiculous the argument that
the President's Cabinet is already too un
wieldy and said the President could never
get too many 1 good: advisers. . <
President Richards made a plea for
honesty : in high places . and said . miners
should stand together and make a hon
est -. fight t f or , their ; rights against the
crooks and rascals in the mining business.
He favored giving Alaska \u25a0 representation
in.Cpngress, declaring: "Alaska .will yet
be one of the most stable influences in our
industrialdevelopment in the hour of na
tional strain, in sustaining : the hand of
our. Government^ because, of the enormous
quantities of \u25a0 precious J and commercial
metals which . that country is capable of
producing." ; \u25a0â¢â¢'\u25a0.
.President' Richards paid a tribute to
the work of the Geological Survey, but
said it was not large enough; and a min
ing, survey, ; with 'plenty" of men, : should
be devoted to , the work of the miners.
He hoped to see the congress soon es
tablished in its permanent home in Den
ver and urged that the home be fitted'
with a mining library, ore cabinets, maps
and all conveniences ; for the miner. .
Resolutions were adopted' urging the ,
creation of .'a ' Department <of : Mines by
Congress,, urging Congress {to pass laws
providing for the location of mines on
Spanish j land \ grants in 'Arizona and New
Mexico, titles to which â¢ have been ' con
firmed by a Government court of land
claims and . urging the j hydrographic bu
reau, to properly locate all desert,, water
holes and erect metal posts in ttyfeir vi
cinity that will i indicate their : direction.
It is also urged that rangers be provided
to keep such water free from pollution.
All the resolutions were referred to a
committee. / '

and then turned his pistol against himself
and. tired a bullet through his temple,
dying on the spot. The killing occurred
at the home of the Kaflta's at 1103 Fedora

explained, except that Fritz, 111 with
brooding over the death of their mqthe.C^|
some months ago, was seized "with a fit .
of dementia and slew his brother and
himself. He left a* note addressed to his
father, saying -that he had killed his
brother, and taken his own life becati3Â«
he -believed the two. were a burden to
their father and were better oft dead.

a real estate firm and maintained ofilces
in a downtown building. There had been
no previous trouble between thÂ» boys so
far as is known. To-night . Ludwig and
his father returned to their -home late

BEFORE THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE
Equitable Society
Controlled by
Harriman.
Large Sum Paid to
Ex-Governor
Odell.
Mysteriouss6Bs,ooo
Loan Is Finally
Explained
NEW YORK, Nov. 14.â James Hazen
Hyde, former vice president of\the
Equitable Life Assurance Society,
whose resignation followed the sensa
tional disclosures in that company last
spring, which led to the investigation
of insurance company methods by the
Armstrong: committee of the Legisla
ture, the man whose presence as a
witness before this committee has been
locked forward to In the expectation
that it -would produce the greatest sen
sation of the investigation, appeared
before the committee to-day.
Hyde's manner on the stand was one
of composure and deliberation and his
replies to questions from counsel were
calm and deliberate and ofttimes
studied. He was fortified with state
ments and data and was very frank In
his explanations. Frequently he would
become bitter in his reference to some
of his associates, while his entire tes
timony was of deep interest and cleared
up many points that have heretofore
remained in the dark. It was not un
til late in the day that the sensational
features df his testimony were de
veloped.
Hyde was called to the stand short
ly after the session opened this morn-
Ing ar.d he was under examination all
day until a few minutes before ad
journment was taken. In anticipation
of his presence as a witness there was
& greater crowd than has attended the
cessions of the committee heretofore
and extra police were stationed in the
corridor without the committee room
to keep order.
ALEXANDER'S f655,000 LOAX.
Hyde cleared up the matter of the
5665,000 loan of the Mercantile Trust
Company, which appeared on thÂ» books
of the Equitable Life under the caption
of the J. \V. Alexander No. 3 account.
This account has been under investiga
tion on several previous occasions, but
none of the witnesses heretofore ex
amined had been able to explain it.
Hyde first beard of this account
fa the fall of 1902, vÂ» brn It TÂ»nÂ« called
to bis attention by J "resident Alexan
der, wbo said that he and Jordan had
Incurred tbe loan to take up stock
that nai belnc bid up to fictitious
value* to tbe detriment of the com
pany: to settle suits that vrere ham
iM-ricjr ibe bnstnenH of the society, and
for a campaign contribution. This con
tribution vvaai the one to the last cam
jkilkd. and .was aiikrd for by Prick,
who su^Kested It for the benefit of the
society.
To procure this money Alexander had
Hyde write a letter to tbe president of
the Mercantile Trust Company and this
letter practically placed him in the po
sition of a guarantor.
Later, when the settlement of the
loan was forced, Alexander and Jor
dan raised all they could toward it.
The stock purchased with part of the
loan v.as sold to Thomas F. Ryan for
5212,000 and the balance, 5212.5 M,
Hyde paid personally. He did this be
cause he understood that Alexander
was financially embarrassed. In a bit
ter tone Hyde said:
Notwithstanding the strained relations with
thes* twu gentlemen (Alexander and Jordan)
I felt bound to Â£'cc that the debt was llqui
.ia.te<S. by reason of the letter Mr. Alexander
extracted from me.
HYOB*h INCOME 2VOT B.\ORMOUS.
Hydft said that he received a salary of
$30,000 seven -years ago. In 1902, when
n* became chairman of the nnance com
mittee, this wus advanced to $75,000,
and in' l9o3 it was advanced to $100,000.
at which It remained until he resigned
aa vice presiu<r.t of the society.
Hyde presented a statement showing
that in the seven years of his connec
tion with the Lkiuitable Life and the
allied corporations hi" average income
had been only a little more than 533.004
a year. This was htfurcd j.s seven years'
salary from the I-.qui table, amounting
to Sl2s.oC'\ from which he deducted his
losses in syndicate transaction::,
amounting to SiS,6ls, and the $21i*,500
paid on the 5C55.000 loan, which left :i

Sometimes?
If so, it will interest you to
know that it can be stopped
with Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills;
and without any bad after-
effects, and this without dan-
ger of forming a drug habit or
having your stomach disar-
ranged. They positively con-
tain no opium, morphine, co-
caine, chloral, ether or chloro-
form in any form. Dr. Miles'
Anti-Pain Pills "relieve pain,
and leave only a sense of relief.
The reason for this is. explained
by the fact that Headache comes
from tired, irritable, turbulent,
over-taxed brain nerves. Anti-
Pain Pills soothe and strength-
en these nerves, thus removing
the cause.. They are harmless
when taken as directed.
"We use Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pflls
for the cure of headache, and we
think thru there is nothing that â¢will
equal them. They, will cure the
severest spell of .nervous or eick
headache in a very few minutra. I
am of a nervous temperament, ana
occasionally have spells when my
nerves seem to be completely exhaust-
ed, and I tremble so I can scarcely
contain myself. At these times I al-
ways* take the AnU-Pain Pills, and
they quiet me right away. It is re-
markable what a soothing effect they
have upon the nerves."
MRS. F. E. KARL, Detroit. Mich.
Dr. Miles' Antl-Paln Pills are sold by
your druggist, who will guarantee that
the first package will benefit. If It
falls, he will return your money.'

nual income of $37,637, to which was
added the average income from his of
fices in the trust companies of 510,500.
Witness said he presented this state
ment to show that he had been mis
represented.
The instructions by Jordan to A. C.
Fields, the *'J<;risl&tive generalissimo."
aa HuÃ'h(-s referred to him to-day, Hyde
knew nothing about. He said he never
consulted with Jordan about legislative
matters, and that. none of the legisla
tive measures .-ift'ected him or his inter
ests in any way.
The syndicate operations of J t 11.
Hyde and associates were gone into
very thoroughly, and it v.-as shown th.it
in twenty-three syndicates Hyde sus
tained personal losses of $28,615. Hyde
ascribed the apportionment of the
L'qui table's allotment of bonds in syn
dicates to officers of the Equitable Life
to the customs and usages of "Wall
street. Â»
On the formation of the J. J-L Hyde
and associates' syndicate, Hyde said
Alexander suggested it for the con
venience of bankers.
H.UIKIMA.VS WILI. IS LAW.
Of the 500.000.000 Union Pacific pool.
Hyde said Harriman instigated it. and
explained it was to be a holding syn
dicate for five years. It was under
stood this was for the purpose of con
trolling: the Union Pacific. Hyde signed
the syndicate agreement at HarrimanVs
suggestion, and talked only with Har
riman on the subject. The executive
committee was- not Informed of this op
eration, as Hyde Â«a!Â«I that Alexander
did not think it necessary and that
Harriman requested that the committee
pc not informed cf it. Ho said that
Harriman evon refused to give a state
ment of the purposes of the pool to the
superintendent of insurance when ho
was "clamoring; for It" last spring.
Eclfpiringr all this nen-aJlonal testi
mony. hoiTever, were the â¢Â»latemenls of
Hyde conrerniai? former Governor
Odoll and Mr. Harriman relative to the
Metdement of the nhip-bnlldloi; com

iiyde knew of no actual steps that were
taken, nor of any bill that was introduced,
but he was beset with rumors that such
steps were about to be taken by, legisla
tion. The Equitable Life, he said, was
not Interested beyond the connection it
had with the Mercantile Trust Company.
Hyfle waa under the impression that the
Mercantile In settlement retained * the
bonds and paid Odell about $75,000. The
original claim of Odell was about 5180,
000. The bonds subsequently netted about
50 cents on the dollar. Hyde said Harri
man suggested the settlement of the suit
and that the counsel and members of the
executive committee of the Mercantile
Trust advised it, and he recommended
It-
OBJECTS TO BEING EXILED.
Charges of conspiracy ' to get him out!
of the country were* made by Hyde i
against Henry C. Frick and . E. H. Har- j
riman, in connection with the reported
aspirations of Hyde to become Embas- !
sador to France. He Frick inspired â¢
the idea and witness took It as " a joke â¢
at first, but when Frick brought it up !
later Hyde was flattered, and both Har- \
riman and Frick promised to mse . their .
influence to secure the appointment. â¢
Again Hyde waxed bitter in ; his ex- j
planation of the extraordinary interest;
these gentlemen had in his absence from
the country- He \u25a0 said he thought their Â»
idea was. "that they would acquit them
selves of their friendly, stewardship with
great profit to themselves," â and ; added !
that the nature of their Interest had ]
since become very obvious. Hyde charged
Frick with breach of faith in leading him
to believe that- the; Friek committee was

could to dissuade witness from. selling his]
stock: "at the same, time." as Hyde I

The association discussed questions
suggested by the experiences of Amer

of the Rhodes scholarships at Oxford

Campbell of the University. of Oregon
opened the talk on the subject. \ The
opinion was expressed by some that the

training for American \ students, : ; and
that as the' project was in the early
stages of its history, judgment should
not be tinally passed upon it at ; this
time. It was contended that. American
students ..generally are much, further
advanced in their studies than- an ad
mission to the university ordinarily re
quires and that they suffer in conse

China proper, but in a British depen
dency, which can scarcely be, called to
account as was the Chinese Govern

BECOMES HOST
Entertains Thousand Amer

on the Flagship Drake
FLAGS AEE ENTWINED
Friendship of} Anglo-Saxon
Nations Illustrated in
the '"Vessel's Decorations
: NÂ£W YORK. Nov. 14.- Admiral Prince
Louis of Battenberg became the host to
day, and, In return for the hospitality
which has been shown him during his
stay In American waters, gave a magnif
icent, dance on board bis flagship, the
Drake.' The thousand or : more Invited
guests included officials and society peo
pie In Annapolis, Washington. Baltimore
and West Point, as well as in New York.
At the entrance of the long Cunard
pier floated -a tremendous British flag.
Passing through the doorway, half way
down the pier, the guests saw a curtain
of red, white and blue bunting enclosing
the supper room, which occupied the
other hair of the pier. Shut in with
â¢heavy canvas, the interior was all aglov
with the light from - the festoons of red,
white and blue electric bulbs strung from
the center of the roof, which was formed
by* a canopy of bunting.
-. Just outside the supper room was the
gangway by which the guests went
aboard the Drake. The entire ship was
enclosed in a heavy canvas. Coming over
the side the guests passed along the port
side to the Quarter deck, where Prince
Louis received. The tented walls of the:
after deck were hung with flags of the
nations, and the stars and stripes and the
Union Jack were everywhere intertwined.
From the quarter deck the guests
passed up a stairway banked with flags
to \u25a0 the Drake's ball room.
From the main derrick, rising high
v from the center of the boat deck, shone
the stars of the original thirteen States,
made of little electric lights on a fold of
blue bunting. From this central point
were draped^ tent-fashion the red and
white stripes of American flags. Be
neath this stars and stripes stretched
across the polished ball room floor built
along the entire boat deck and extending
aft to the last of the Drake's four fun
nels, affording room . for more than 200
couples. Rising from the floor to meet
the canopied roof were walls of bunting
and ships' flags. At regular Intervals
around the"- walls- were American and
British flags, draped fan-shape and in
between were round framed mirrors.
These mirrors were really the reflectors
of- the ship"s powerful searchlight 1 !,
framed in inflated life buoys. A diver's
uniform inflated stood at the end of the
deck, holding a basket of dance cards
on the extended right arm.':
. Through this wonderful garden of color
strolled nearly a thousand guests. On
the after bridge overlooking the . ball
room was the band of the ' Drake which
furnished music for the dancing.

DUPLICATE SET

SUITS WILL BE FILED
Federal Government About
to Bring Criminal Ac
tions to Punish Culprits
PITTSBURG. Nov. 14.â 1f the lat
est report concerning the Enterprise
Bank Is true. Receiver Cunningham Is in
possession of a duplicate set of books
kept by persons in the bank between
August 25 last, when the Federal exam
ination was made, and the day the bank
closed its doors. This Information comes
from one of the directors of the Enter
prise Bank, who appeared to be surprised
that no mention had been previously
made of this incident In the examination
of the bank's accounts.
The finding of the books was some days
subsequent to the suicide of Cashier
Clark, and a perusal of them had been oÂ£
invaluable assistance In tracing to their
source many of the fraudulent financial
transactions that wrought the wreck of
the bank. It is said Examiner Moxey
carried with him to Washington a com
plete copy of these accounts and upon
them the Federal Government will" base
its criminal suits. ,-.â¢'
Just who will be bit by the contem
plated action Is a matter of conjecture.
The presumption is that Clark had not
sole knowledge of these-booka and was
not the only person who made entries In
them.
It is known that certain employes of
the Enterprise Bank have been compelled
to secure their notes and make real es
tate transfers. Inquiry into the reason
for this elicits the information that these
employes secured loans from the bank
that hava not yet been met. "What the
sums aggregate Is not known, but Re
ceiver Cunningham insisted that these
loans be insured by notes and property
transfers of equal value.

TALBOT WANTS
HIS CHILDREN
.- Moves to Modify Injunction
by Which Their Mother
detains Their Custody
CASE KEADY FOB TKIAL
Attorneys Wait the Day
When Judge Murasky Is
Free to Hear Their Pleas
Now for the decisive battle of the war
that has been progressing for weeks in
the household of Millionaire WilJtam H.
Talbot. A motion to restore to Judge
Murasky'g calendar the petition of Tal
bot for the modification for the restrain
ing order heretofore issued against him
at the instance of his wife. Annie D. Tal
bot, has been granted. It will be argued
immediately upon the conclusion of the
hearing of the application of Mrs. Talbot
for a monthly allowance of $2500 for her
maintenance pending the final decision
of her application for permanent, sep
arate maintenance at the hands of the
capitalist, who is still her husband.
The petition of Millionaire Talbot to
raodify this restraining order Is fraught
witn significance and will be resisted with
all the power that Mrs. Talbot can sum
mon. It means that now that the legal
contest Is well under way Talbot Is ready
to move to secure, if possible, the abso
, lute control of his children. Since Mrs.
â¢ Talbot Instituted her action for mainten
ance the youngsters have been in his sole
â¢ possession but once, and then, to secure
their custody for a day's outing, the court
called upon him to deposit a bond of
$?VJdO to insure their safe return'lo their
mother.
The knowledge that Talbot demands the
modification of the restraining order,
which enjoins him from disposing of bis
property or removing his children from
beyond the Jurisdiction of the court, goes
far toward affirming the statement of
Attorney Samuel M. Shortridge. who rep
resents Mrs. Talbot, that It Is his wUh to
take his children to an Eastern college
for education and establish them "where
social training Is the larger part of the
curriculum."
â¢ But it is Mrs. Talbofs wish that the
little ones be trained with full regard for
her feelings, that when they grow to the
estates of manhood and womanhood their
hearts will be warm with the memory
that at their mother's side they learned
the lessor.s of life. So when the motion
to modify the restraining order comes up
Mrs. Talbot will ask why her children
should be taken from her.
The petition of Mrs. Talbot for main
tenance oendente lite was on the calen
dar for hearing yesterday, but a Hen case.
Involving about $1000, which has been on
trlaJ for weeks, prevented the hearing.
Judge Murasky announced, however, that
he would take the Talbot case up at the
conclusion of the lien case and hear all
the evidence that either wife or husband
or both had to produce, "providing, how
ever." ho said in conclusion, "that we are
not called to our fathers before the des
tiny of this $100", on which a lien heavily
rcEts, is finally determined." v-/-/

of the arsenal, carrying red flags, made
a demonstration and 2500 workmen

Just claims vrould receive attention.
The reports of the Ministry of

STRICT EXCLUSION URGED
BY LABOR FEDERATION.
The executive. Council of the American {Federatiojrifof \u25a0 Labor has \ taken a determined stand
for the strict enforcement of the Chinese exclusion" laws^and for (the /eightrKourVday ; ?on;'Goverri^.
ment work. An appeal by Vice, President James Dujican Jot the \u25a0Federation for equal rights for
women in all elections was enthusiastically received by the "delegates.
Firmly Opposed to
Lowering Bars for
. Chinese.
PITTSBURG. Nov. 14. â A determined
stand was taken in it.s annual report
bj' the executive council of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor, for the en
forcement to the letter of tne Chinese
exclusion laws of the country, the /
legalizing of the eight-hour day on all
work of the Government; the abolition
of convict labor where it competes
wlthjunion manufactured goods, and
thÂ« renewal of the agitation for the
abolition of the injunction laws of the
country. The report was submitted at
to-day's session of the convention ; in
the old City. Hall. The report . was
unanimous and its reading consumed
the greater part of the proceedings.
The council voiced the sentiments of
the organization as being opposed to
the present Immigration laws as ap
plied to all classes of labor. An in
vestigation was asked of the Govern
ment of the. many reports and rumors
of assisted immigration. The report
took the national administration to
task for its failure to enforce the.
eight-hour law in all Government work
and a plea was made for every State
labor organization immediately to in
stitute a campaign for the establish
ment in -, their respective States of the
eight-hour law. .
A popular "chord" was struck when
Vice President James Duncan, who
was reading the report, made a ring
ing appeal for equal rights in all elec
tions for women. The proposal was
enthusiastically received. \
The seating of C. P. Bhea, president of
the Teamsters' Union of Chicago, as a
delegate to-day is looked upon by the
International Association of Stone Cutters
as a big card for them in their fight for
a federation charter, as Shea, who has
been Joined by, other delegates, will hold
them in the' convention.
The second day's session of the conven
tion was rapped to order promptly at 9
o'clock this morning by President Gomp r
ers. He called John Mitchell, second. vice
president, to the chair, and James Dun
can, first vice president, read the annual
report of the executive council.
The coppersmiths â¢ made application for
a charter, but it was denied, and the or
ganization was urged to affiliate, with the
Amalgamated Sheet Metal Workers' In
ternational Alliance. Arrangements have
been made for the consolidation of the
two organizations. There are a large
number of organizations not now affiliated
with the federation and the executive
council urges that additional efforts be
made to bring them into the federation.
It is recommended that unions^ establish
funds and insist on higher dues.
In the matter of the protection of chil
dren, the executive council had bills in
troduced in the Legislatures of many
States prohibiting the employment \u25a0of
children in mills, factories, mines and in
dustrial establishments. â¢ The' progress
made during the year was riot- untiralj*
satisfactory and President Gompers was
authorized tp enlist the 'assistance of
other organizations in -.securing the pass
age of legislation In. all States prohibiting
thÂ« employment of child, labor; ' â¢: t l
It was decided) that in the future the
executive council shall not interfere in
d!sputes between, labor organizations un
less the unions involved have, exhausted
all means to bring about an adjustment
of the differences.
An assessment of one cent a member
a week for a period of four weeks was
levied on the entire membership of the
federation for the benefit of the Inter
national Typographical Union, in its ef
forts to establish an eight-hour work day
in the Job and . commercial printing es
tabliKhments in the United States and
Canada. The Typographical Union has
levied a substantial assessment for that
purpose and all organizations are urged
to render all the assistance possible to
the printers In their efforts to establish
the eight-hour day by January 1, 1906. : -
The American Federation of Musicians
offered a resolution, which was adopted,
thanking the labor unions of San Fran
cisco for supporting -Mayor Schmitz
against the enemies of organized labor.
A telegram was ordered sent -to Mayor,
S?hmitz, informing him of the action
taken.
The question of immigration was given
consideration by the executive commit
tee. It was shown that over 1,009,000
foreigners reached these shores last year
and that there would be no decreased
number this year. It. was urged that"ef
forts be made to organize this foreign ele
ment, as the low wages for which they
now work are not only insufficient, but
have a bad effect on all American toilers.
The auditing committee's report showed
that the . federation is in a gopd condition
and that the report of Treasurer Lennon
was correct.

WASHINGTON. Nov. 14.â An earnest
protest was made to the President' to
day against the -proposed railroad
freight' rate legislation. The protest
was filed by . of% \the
five great labor ' organizations con
nected with . railroadingâ the engintersi
firemen, --conductors, switchmen .and
trainmen. -.-â¢ The members 'of the delega
tion which called, onl the President rep
resented-; ; the . several i organizations.
They pointed out,;. to' him that railroad
rate legislation ; meant | the ' lowering^ of
rates.} This, they, contended, .will be
followed.by, a lessening of the earning
power ." of ,'â¢ railroads? and * consequently
by^ a reduction ,Iri;the wages of--'rail
road employes. ; The delegation "came
from twelve" different j States and \ rep
iesented*all of the larger systems, of
railroads. ; , r ':'.'] 'â¢'\u25a0\u25a0
'-\u25a0\u25a0: President Roosevelt .assured the del
egation; that it was not; his purpose" or
the purpose of. those who favored'rail
road rate regulation -to; ; do â¢anything
that might' injure the railroads of .the
country ; or to injure" the : employes^of
the railroads.' ' He said It was tvs pur
pose'that'all .classesâ railroads, : ship
pers and employesâ should have per
fectly fair treatment. .' * '" ' v
The statement -presented'",- to : the
President: was in part as follows:**., 1 ' ;
\u25a0-The railroad "employes' arid those "dependent
upon them . represent upward of 0,000,000 of
people', in.' this .--country, "who^e learnings :ap
proximately t amount - to . $500,000,000 annually.
We 'believe there, is ho other class of American
workmen 'who present a higher general stand
ard "of \u25a0 citizenship .'than- the- railroad employe*
and we also claim that we are entitled to fair
and: impartial consideration In the. framing
or adoption of -any 'â¢ national . legislation . that
threatens ' our general prosperity. ; We . take
keen and active Interest : In all matters that
seem to conduce to a higher and broader stand
ard of . conditions for the " worklngmen of tnls
country end therefore it is not . strange that
since the inception -of .this movement ior. na
tional - legislation - upon railroad rates all rail
road employes have, from time to" time.' and in
various ways expressed their convictions.. -
For examine, the - Brotherhood -of Kallroad
Trainmen,'- with a" membership of'-SO.OOO,
at their last annual meeting In Buffalo
last spring adopted resolutions of the most
emphatic nature against any reduction In rail
road rates. â¢ The Brotherhood of Locomotive
Engineers and . the Brotherhood of Locomotive
Firemen have expressed similar views by offi
cial utterances,' and the some can .be said of
the Switchmen's National Association. The
Order of Railroad Conductors at their biennial
convention at Portland, Ore., last May in
dorsed resolutions of the same nature.
The membership of these organizations Is
now a -little more than a quarter of a million
and there n re still behind- us another full mil-
lion .of laborers In the railroad world who
would be similarly affecteH by any . reductions
in the earning capacity of the' railroad lines
of this country and what Impresses us with
more force than any side of the issue Is this:
\u25a0Why have the railroad interests In particular
been selected for \u25a0 this attack ? Why hafe the
Interstate Commerce Commission or some simi
lar commission not been clothed with the same
absolute authority to fix the maximum prices
en beef, pork, oil, â¢ clothing, butter and eggs,
etc. â in â¢ tact, everything which one has to
buy every. day? ; ._" \u25a0â¢:....-.â¢, 'â¢ â¢ .
It iMira to us that â¢ such a step would be
infinitely more -reasonable than this proposed
move .on . rr-ilrcad rates, '.; because . all of . these
and other, commodities have advanced by leaps
and bounds, . and by methods which we all
agree would bear investigation, -while the gen
eral average of railroad freight rates has stead
ily decreased from 2 cents per ton per mile' ln
IS7O down to three-fourths of ' 1 cent per ton
per. mile to-day and. during the past ten years
tho *\u25a0 railroad .companies" have granted sub-..
etanti.il wago concessions to their employes and
also ameliorated labor conditions. -
,We believe that In the : increase in earning
power and economical management the limit
has been reached. Therefore. ; we believe that
we take a fair and- just view of the situation
whin we clelm that no national legislation
should te adopted which shall tend in any de
gree to interfere with or Interrupt the . present
or future prosperity of the railroad employes
in this country.

United States Senator, was divorced
yesterday .from, Belle -Dormer, whom

Aided by . Dormer, the- Republicans'
stood stoutly. against the Silver party,
but finally it was swept aside, and

it was but a memory. Now* it is again

"For more than a year.", testlaed lira.
Dormer yesterday, "my husband ha 3
been away from me. and has refused
to return. I believe he is now in Loa
Angeles. He has contributed nothing' to
me for my support, nor has he aided
our son. Why he abandoned us 1 do not
know."
The lad. fi handsome youngster of IS
years, corroborated his mother, as did
other witnesses and tho decree was
issued on the grounds of desertion and
failure to provide.
A citation v.*as issued yesterday by
Judge Graham directing Kdqrar R. Sutro
to appear on an order of examination,
the purpose of which is to determine
what properties are now. in his posses

3IISSING SEVERAL DAYS
Graduate of Stanford Is Be

' by Falling From a Glacier
Special Diepatcb to TbÂ« Call.
SEATTLE, Nov. 14.â Edward A.
Spencer, a graduate o ; the Oakland
High School a.nd Stanford University,
whose parents reside in Oakland, is
either lost In the timber wilds of
Alaska, north of Seward, or his body
is lying at the bottom of a glacier
crevasse. Searching parties nave been
cut since Saturday morning, but ac
cording to a dispatch received here to
night, no trace of the young man Can
be found.
Spencer had been employed as a
timekeeper on the Alaska Central Rail
road. His gang has been working at
mile post 52. On Thursday afternoon
he started from the post to the grad
ing camp, about four miles distant. Be
fore he left it was getting dark and
it is believed he lost his way. Stray
ing from the path on one side he would
get into the timber and on the other
to a glacier bed filled with crevasses.
When he did not show yup Friday a
searching party was organized and the
fact that he has not yet been found
leads to the belief that he has fallen
from a glacier.
Edward A- Spencer is the son of p.
A. Spencer, an insurance adjuster of
this city, with offices at 322 Pine
street. The family recently moved
from Oakland to San Francisco and
could not be located last night.

Fire Was First Discovered
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SANTA CRUZ. Nov. 14.â Flames issuing
from the top of a live redwood tree is
the sizht that can be seen in the State
Park in the Big Basin. This is the third
time in fourteerijnonths that flames have
been visible. The ; fire is burning con
stantly, but at times so slowly that It
is not perceptible. ' The heart of the
tree is decayed and it burns like a punk
until the blaze burns a hole through tho
trunk. This forms a vent, and causes the
smoldering embers to burst into flames.
The tree was 140 feet in height when it
first took fire. Now it Is but 90 feet
high.
TALKS ABOUT
FORCED DEEDS
Special Dispatch to Tht Call.
SEATTLE, Nov. 14.â The* first ray of
light on the wholesale forged real estate
deeds In California, Washington and Mis
souri, whereby victims have lost thou
sands of dollars, was developed " to-night
In a statement by Ira P. Norton, who
negotiated the deals for J. Ralph Norton,
in whose favor the forged Instruments
are made. Swan says:
Less than a year ago I was Informed by a
friend that much land owned by J. Ralph
Norton In this State was being Â«old for taxes.
No one knew Norton's address, so I sent about
one hundred letters to different parts of the
country and finally received a reply from Nor
ton at Chicaeo saying he had much land in
thia State California and Missouri, which he
wished I would take charge of and Bell. He
sent me a power of attorney \u25a0 dated March 28.
19C5, and acknowledged before E. Quisenberry
and Mary B. Bell, both notaries of Bt. Louis.
On this I proceeded and If anything Js wrong
it Is In 6t. Louis, where I understand Norton
had an office and in San FrancJsco. I have
never met Norton and all our deals have been
by mall. Every deed I received from Norton
was acknowledged either by the St. Louis or
San . Francisco notary publics. Norton has
never told me his business and I know no
other address than Chicago. When sales were
madÂ© en the deeds 6ent I forwarded him the
proceeds less my ct*imlsslon to general de

and literary programme in honor of "Tv-
Eltala." the native Samoan name for Rob
ert Louis Stevenson. Christ Episcopal
Church opened a four-days festival in
Parish Hail to-night. Macky Sutherland,
president of the Stevenson Fellowship,
delivered an address on the famous au
thor and a â¢series of Stevenson's songs
was sun* by talented vocalists. In
speaking of Stevenson Mr. Sutherland.
who was a personal Mend of the writer,
eaid: . - ; ,' .
Much Interest is . now developing in tnt
counties about the .bay In the life and work
of Robert Louis Stevenson, but It Is a crying
shame that this recognition of a true seniu*
comes so late. He lived among us for a urn*
when he came to California to fight oft th*
disease which had marked him for death: He
resided a while in San Francisco, In East Oafc
land In Monterey and In Alameda, but 1
have not been able to learn where he lived
while In this city. San Francisco has pro
duced come or the best artists and writers in
America but they have been compelled to go
away from home to have their merit appre
ciated. When Stevenson was in San Fran
cisco his grenlus was not noticed, and when he
aalled from there in a yacht for. the South Seas
his departure was not considered an event oÂ»
any cocsecuence.
Stevenson suffered with a smile. WhllÂ»
other religions teach us how to die, Stevenson
teaches us how to live. Extracts from his
prayers convey a great message to mankind.
To-morrow afternoon from 2 to 6
will be the bazaar of the Parish Aid

YOUTH FOOLS EDITORS.
OAKLAND, Nov. 14.â With the Idea of
becoming famous as a newspaper corre
spondent, Victor J. Mesplou, aged 16
years,' _ has .brought 'down "the wrath 'of
many Eastern editors upon his head by
sending to them "fake" stories 'of mur
ders and suicides around San Francisco
bay. . '"\u25a0
. The boy is a pupil at the Polytechnic
High School and has been taking a so
called course in correspondence through
'the malls.- He . sent to papers in' Dcs
ilolnes, Keokuk, Buffalo, Spartenburg
and other cities in the Middle "West,
glories of 'murder and suicide that were
printed and frequent queries | to the As
sociated Press resulted in establishing
the.. fact' 'that' the* stories were untrue.
The editors who ' printed the "fake"
stories are up in arms and the boy will
'probably be prosecuted.
MesploU lives with his widowed mother
at 1061 Clay street. When seen to-day, he
said:
I did not begin to send these fake dispatches
until last October. I got directions how to do
the work from a. man named - Heacock. who
advertises for correspondents. He said I must
base my stories on fact,, and I thought If &
story was true, and had happened any place,
I. could send, lt from Oakland. I know it is
wrong to life, but I did not think It would be
wrong to send . those dispatches. .-- ..Â»..â¢\u25a0' *
'\u25a0\u25a0: It not^yet^been- determined -what
action will be taken against the youth.

FACULTY MOVE
IS CRITICIZED
Literary Publication of the
Stanford University Is
Opposed to Censorship
EE VIEWS THE "BOGIE"
Edict Issued at Time oi X
Appearance of Infamous
fellow Slip" Not Liked
Special Dispatch to TbÂ« Call.
STANFOPD , UNIVEBSITT, .14.â
l*he wofst "Bogie" in the history of
Stanford University has come and gone,
but Its effects are still felt. The publi
cation which raised such a cry from the
community was Instrumental at the timÂ»
in " causing the faculty to Issue- an edict
which is felt by a majority of tho stu
dents to be a reflection on the student
body. This edict of the authorities ; pro
vided that all manuscripts for publica
tion or production on the stags should
first be submitted to a committee of one
selected from the faculty. This was done
and that the comment raised by the edict
has not yet ceased is shown by r the strong
editorial which one of the literary publi
cations contains In its last I3sue.
The editorial coming from such "a
source appeals more to the students than
it would otherwise. ' The editorial does
not criticize any action "of the member
of the faculty who at present .* holds the
position of censor. -but praises" his tact.
The precedent Is what the article la
aimed at In part It la as follows: -
Several weeks ago the student . affairs com
mittee appointed 'a censor to pass upon tnÂ»
'OT: pins Ugly before It might be presented.. The
action aroused a storm of protest whlca threat
ened at first to engulf the play entirely and
leave only Its funeral service. "' Thanks.- how
ever, to the tact of the man appointed tor th*
unfortunate, office, the storm wa partly xjulet
ed. We got our Plus Ugly as usual; we got
something, else along with It â a precedent for
the censoring of student productions at Stan
ford.
From every point of view the precedent la a
bad one; from the faculty standpoint, because
it Increases the number of those police officer
duties whose performance Inevitably makes a
man the object of distrust among' the students
with whom he -deals: from the- student stand
point, because the new office, with all that It
Implies, promises to be a source of continual
Irritation in future. aÂ« It 'la now an unwar-^
ranted humiliation. But most of all It la lnrT
the relation of the stndent to the university
that the thin? Is regrettable. It strikes closÂ«
to the sources of our college loyalty. It puts
a premium on excess. As long as human na
ture Is as It la, the sign "Trespassers Forbla
den" will be an Invitation to enter, and to
â¢â¢You dare not" there la but one answer.

FOR CHAIRMAN
Republican County Commit
tee Will Meet Next Tuesday
Evening for Organization
LEADERSHIP BATTLE
Daniel A. Byan Is Supported
by the League and W. BL
Davis by Arthur Fisk
The new Republican County Committee
will meet for organization next Tuesday
evening, end It is common gossip In polit
ical circles that the contest for the chair
manship between Daniel A. Ryan and
Wiljiam H. Davis will be renewed. At
the last meeting of the committee each
aspirant received 43 votes. Only one bal
lot was taken. To avoid friction In the
campaign the contest was postponed un
til the third Tuesday of November. Mr.
Ryan was one of the founders of the San
Francisco Republican League. He was
secretary of the executive committee,
chairman of the Republican convention
and chairman of the fusion campaign
committee. The Fortieth* Assembly Dis
trict, from which he hails, gave the fu
sion ticket 1000 majority In the recent
election.
The candidacy of William H, Davis, at
torney for the Stat* Board of Harbor
Commissioners, was introduced by Post
master Arthur G. Fisk. and in the polit
ical camps It' is common gossip that Mr.
Flsk is making the fight for Mr. Davis at
the suggestion of W. F. Herrin, but many
well posted politicians assert that the
Southern Pacific Company has no candi
date for the committee chairmanship.
It Is expected that Ruef will "bob up"
as a Republican in the gubernatorial con
test next year, using his Union Labor fol
lowers to vote at the August primary fÂ° r
delegates to the Republican State con
vention. He tried the same game at the
August primary this year, and would
have captured a majority of the delegates
to the local Republican convention if the
Ban Francisco Republican League had
not actively opposed him. .
The organization committee of the San
Francisco Republican League â George D.
Clark chairman. Daniel A. Ryar. secre
tary. Fairfax H. Wheelan, David Rich.
John D. Daly, John Lackmann. Richard
J. Welch and E. J. Bowesâ made a splen
did primary campaign. The committee
favors the candidacy of Mr. Ryan for
chairmanship of the County Committee.
Mr. Davis Is also regarded as a capable
Republican, whose loyalty to the league
is unquestioned; still there Is a sentiment
that Mr. Ryan has fairly -earned the
party's recognition. He went down to
defeat with the fusion forces in the elec
tion on the 7th tnst.. but throughout the
active engagement he fought In cour
ageous and manly style.

TRIES TO KILL
FORMER FRIEND
James O'Leary, Crazed With
Liquor, Shoots at James
Nolan and His Aged AVif e
MAN SLIGHTLY INJURED
Woman Just Escapes Death,
the Bullet Passing Directly
Over the Top of Her Head
Crazed from continued libations of
water front whisky until he no longer
knew friend from foe, John O'Leary,
longshoreman, -walked into the house of
his one-time fellow workman and friend,
aged James Nolan, "deliberately shot at
Mrs. Nolan, who was peacefully Ironing,
and then, leaving her for dead, attempted
to murder the old man who had once
been kind to him. Fortunately, the first
bullet missed the woman and burled It
self harmlessly In the wall, while the
one shot which did strike Nolan barely
grazed the back of his shoulders. O'Leary
was overpowered by Sergeant Patrick
Mahoney, who heard the shots, and book
ed at the Southern Station.
The shooting, which came so near re
sulting In a tradegy. occurred shortly
before noon yesterday. O'Leary had
formerly been a firm friend of Nolan and
his wife and three years ago he lodged
with them for several months. When he
entered the house yesterday morning
Nolan welcomed him with a "Hello,
Jack," and gave him the best chair that
the little home on Brannan street afford
ed. O'Leary talked calmly to Mrs. Nolan,
while Nolan himself went Into the front
room to change his clothes. \i'-.: i
Suddenly O'Leary stood up. "I have
come to kill you both," he cried. He
piaced the pistol within four feet of the
woman's head and fired. She dropped to
the floor. Nolan ran Into the room to
see what the matter was, saw his wife
lying there apparently dead, and then
ran out the front way, just In time to
miss the second bullet from the crazed
man's gun. He fell through the door
way just as O'Leary shot again, this
time the bullet scraping across his
shoulders.
Xolan saw that he could not escape, so
he turned and grappled with O'Leary.
The two struggled on the ground, the
revolver going off In the air. Finally No
lan threw the man half way through a
door and, leaving him there, ran down
the stairway to the street. He ran into
the first saloon to give the alarm. There
stood his wife. The first shot had passed
over her head and she had fallen
down from fright. She had left the house
by a rear door.
O'Leary calmly walked down the stairs
and started up the street. Sergeant Ma
heney saw him and with the help of
others succeeded in overpowering him.
O'Leary's wrists were so large that lt
was with difficulty that Mahoney slipped
on the handcuffs. ,
Nolan says he will prosecute O'Leary.
He can think of no reason why he should
have been bo attacked. He says O'Leary
is often crazy with drink and has twice
attempted 6u!cide. The scene of the
shooting was SM Brannan street.
3lcl,ousrhlln Inquest Held.
An inquest was held at the Coroner's
office yesterday Into the cause of death
of Patrick McLaughlln, saloon-keeper,
who was shot and killed In his saloon
at Beale and Bryant streets last "Wednes
day night. Several witnesses were
examined. Including James Morrlssey,
the man suspected of firing the fatal
Ehot, but nothing new was elicited, and
the jury brought in an open verdict.
Jlorrissey will probably be charged
with murder to-day.

WILL CASE
DEVELOPS A
WEIRD TALE
Contestants Claini That Con
trol of Mrs. ; Ellinghouse
Was Obtained by Asserting
i That Her Dead Son Talked
SAY SHE WAS GIVEN
WORD FROM GRAVE
Ask That the Whole Proper
ty of the Woman Be Divid
ed Among All the Children
Instead of Given to One
A picture worthy, of the pen of a dram
atist is contained in the testimony Intro
duced in the hearing, before Judge Coffey
of the contest to the will of the late Mrs.
Bertha Ellinghouse. This ; testimony has
been closed and an order made that ar
gument proceed Friday ; morning.
At the | conclusion of [ argument Judge
Coffey will write his opinion, and in It
he must deal wlthi a question of the su
pernatural as weird as ever crept Into the
records of a court of justice. This ques
tion \u25a0\u25a0; will deal with the effect upon the
mind of Mrs. Ellinghouse of a tale told
to her by the proponents of her will as
she lay on her deathbed. It was to the
effect that the grave wherein lay the
body of her beloved son, Alfred,, had
yawned and that his spirit had - stepped
forth into the night to counsel with those
that most cared for her and : to send to
her through them a message guiding her
in the disposition of her estate. :
' The -wife of Oscar Ellinghouse was on
the stand - when the facts as stated were
revealed. Before she was called as a wit
ness, however. Attorney Samuel M.
Shortrldge, representing the contestants,
a son and a daughter of the testatrix,
Edwin Ellinghouse and \u25a0 Mrs. Mary G.
Stone, had told of the strange manner in
which Mrs. Ellinghouse, then suffering
from senility as testified by; her v physi
cian, received the news of the * death .of
her son. Of her four children he was
her favorite and as the weight of her
years bore more heavily upon her he was
the strong staff that supported her and
guided her to the realm of good; cheer.
So when one day she was told that her
son had^closed behind him the "mysteri
ous dcor of death she was frenzied 1 with
grief for a time, and later came /to be
lieve that her son was not dead, but that
she was the victim of a hideous-joke per
petrated to wring her heart. V;
HEARS SON'S FOOTSTEPS.
One night as her nurse sat ; beside her
bed she waÂ£ startled by the voice or Mrs.
Ellir.ghouse crying: out:
"My son Alfred is not dead; I hear his
footsteps on the stairway; that is he
coming."
It was a long time before the tremb
ling woman could be calmed and ; ahe re
tained the belief that her son was yet
alive up to a short time before her death.
How she was finally . convinced { that:.- he
had passed f rom . this world la bes^ | told
In the testimony, off Mrs.-, Oscarj.ElHog
house In answer to questions propounded
by Attorney Snortrldge. : "/.->". â¢
"Did not you and' your husband carry
a message ' to Mrs. Ellinghouse : that you
had gone to a medium; that the spirit
of Alfred had appeared before you; that
he was happy "and 'wished his mother to
know that with him ail was welL"
For a moment Mrs. 'Ellinghouse was si
lent and then she said:- "
"Yes ; we did bear a message to Mrs.
Elllnghouse. She was worried about her
son aiJd we wished to relieve hfer mind.
Ail 1 told her though was that Mrae.
young, the medium, had said, that Albert
did not want her to d.spose ?of some
bronzes she had. I said, nothing about
other property." Â» -
"Is it not a fact," said. Attorney Short
ridge, shaking his head "to more rirmly
implant the import of his question in the
mind of the witness and also in that of
the court, "that you are now consulting
mediums, endeavoring to receive informa
tion from souis that have j gone beyond
as to what success you will Have in this
litigation?" * \u25a0\u25a0-\u25a0 \u25a0-\u25a0 \u25a0.-\u25a0"**â¢Â«*
Judge Coffey sat up straight with' a
start. If ' any one Imagined that' his
Judicial mind was to be subject to In
tangible Influences over iwiiieh he had
no control he wanted to know it. But
the witness denied that she' was seek
ing on" high for judicial favors and
then 'Judge Coflfey : settled bacK, re
lieved that he ; was to be left to his
own resources, his judgment free of iu
tluences that reign In the occult world.
GETS MESSAGE FROM DEAD.
Mrs. Mary G. Stone followed '\. Mrs.
Ellinghouse on the stand. "
"Relate . to the court," said Attorney
Shortrldge, "flic. fact of the convey
ance to - Mrs. Ellinghouse by her son

THE PRODUCTS OF ALAMEDA COUNTY.
WE have had occasion to note the" rapid commercial progress of
Oakland. Much of this has been attributed to; an influx of
residence population, seeking that city for its educational, cli
matic and scenic advantages. While a gain in that kind of population
is exceedingly desirable, it is now revealed that it does not fully ac
count for the advance made in that city. We must now take in ac
count the commercial factor as shown by the statistics furnished, offi
cially, to the Board of Supervisors.
Cities must rely for their commercial position upon the products
of the soil in their hinterland and the products of labor in their manu
facturing: establishments. These are constant factors. The soil re
niains fixed, and manufactures, once well established, approach the
soil in their stability. Other factors in the growth of a city^ such
as die revenues of tourist travel and like resources, go with fashion.
They fluctuate, they ebb and flow. A slight thing may deflect the
current and leave a dry breadth between the banks between which it
flows. Xot so with the products that enter into commerce and sup
ply the necessaries of life. The demand for them is constant, and,
given the means of permanent production, the supply swells with
the demand and becomes permanently reliable as a means and cause
cf city growth.
The immediate hinterland of Oakland is Alameda County. It
extends also into Contra Costa County, in that portion between the
mountains and the bay, and is added to by the wagon road tunnel
through the mountains, and is about to get further addition by electric
road connection?. I
These things concern San Francisco, because they affect Oak
land as our commercial ally, to-be depended upon defensively and of
fensively in maintaining the commercial and financial center of this
coast upon San Francisco Bay. Statistically the two cities 'join
fibres when it comes to a contest for position. The figures sub
mitted to the Supervisors of Alameda County, .show twenty-one
Kinds of manufactures, running from cotton, silk and hemp fabrics
and cordage to glass and clay wares. Four of these pass the mil
lion mark in their values of the past year. These are cotton, silk,
hemp and jute, grouped together, and metal, wood and paints. The
total manufacturing value for the year was $13,285,198. â¢ That is an
increase of several hundred per cent in the last decade. With the
present impulse the increase is so accelerated that by the use of fuel
oil and electric power in manufactures the present figures promise to
be doubled in less than five years. The addition of the establish
ments of the Western Pacific Railway to the present , resources of
Oakland will add a large percentage.
We have often called attention to the capacity of the soil and
climate of California to produce a vast variety of agricultural and
horticultural products. In looking for illustrations of this monopoly
of variety in California we are apt to fix our vision upon distance, led
by the known resources of the great interior valley, and its subsidiary
valleys. But the Alameda County statistics instruct us that we need
not look so far away. They show twenty-seven different kinds of
direct products of the soil Â«(nd five secondary products. By some
oversight the rhubarb industry is omitted, though it supplies enor
mous quantities of the earliest pie plant, which is exported by car
loads to the Eastern markets. This makes twenty-eight articles
which arc going into the market every month in the year from Oak
land's immediate hinterland, and their total value last year was $8,-
Soil that will do this, located so near to a large city population,
gains in value from each new family that comes to the town. The
city, on its side, gains in population, manufactures and property from
its coniigrity to such soil. The two ride and tie. They rise to
gether through a wholesome action and reaction. Who seeks a cause
for the rise in values in Oakland will find it in the soil that is tribu
tary. Who seeks a cause for the rise in values in the soil will find
it in the exceeding increase in the population. and manufactures of
Oakland. Alameda and Berkeley. The economist has in that situa
tion on the east side of the bay, as in a microcosm, the story and
illustration of the growth of countries and cities.
The law passed by the last Legislature providing for these pro
ductive statistics of counties is an excellent measure. It affords'the
means for an authoritative disclosure of the resources of California
and of the causes of the growth of the commonwealth.
THE NEW YORK SITUATION.
WHEN â well, when political partners fall out, honest men get
some news. Mr. Hearst and Tammany have been pulling har
moniously in the same harness, champing the same kind of
bit and saluting with a mutual whinny, but now they are at daggers
points and each has a dozen lawyers of high degree trying to prove
things against the other. Mr. Hearst is soberly convinced that the
fate of nations depends upon his being Mayor of New York, and
Tammany feels that its own fate depends upon keeping him out.
On his side he has the benefit of all the high flood of pent up hatred
of Tammany since the days of Tweed, Dick Genet and Mayor Hall.
It has been ineffectually cherished and has grown year by year,
until anything is a good club in its hands. Mr. Hearst happens to
be in a position to ser^ve as a club, and men are using it who hope to
kill Tammany and break the club at the same time.
No doubt in the late election 'the Tammany tactics, familiar to
all observers of- New York politics, were used against Hearst, as
they have been against Seth Low and others who have before this
tried conclusions with that organization. Whether they were re
sponsible for t Hearst's defeat or simply added to a natural result
may never be known. The matter of 'present interest is the obvious
attempt to overawe the courts by "demonstrations."
We have seen the State and Federal courts reversed by mass
meetings in San Francisco, but the judicial judgment "has always
stood as against reversal by a mob. It makes but little difference
who is Mayor of New York. That city has had good Mayors and
bad. Its government has sometimes >sent up the odor of decayed fish,
and has sometimes exhaled the. aroma- of sweet blooms. Fernando
Wood was not only Mayor, but when secession came on proposed
that the city should secede from the State and nation and become a
free city like the'Hanse towns, sufficient unto itself, with its own
government and arrriy and navy. All these things pass. But that
of permanent value is the reputation of the judicial courts, and public
respect for their decisions. We will wait and see what the courts say
about the election, and when it is said hV will be a poor loser who
After all the trouble and expense which Mr. \u25a0 McCurdy, head of the

THINGS I SHOULD HOPE.
If 1 had a son who was determined to
"play the races" I should hope that he
would lose his last nickel and have to
walk' home after his first attendance.
If I had a daughter who played the
piano in the sitting room while her old
mother, did the work in .the kitchen I
should hope that I might find an oak
shlnglo and be given the grace to use
It. ' '
\u25a0If ever. l were to catch myself being as
mean and small as some men I knowâ .
and I mayâ l, hope that I should hope,
for, the benefit of the world, that the an
gel Gabriel 'would toot his -'horn for me
very soon.
If ever I knowingly vote for a scoundrel
because - he . represents my r>arty I : hope
that I may have the privilege of going
to a school whe,re the elements of decency
are taught. /
If my wife should prove to be irascible
at timesâ but I don't admit itâ l should
hope that I would ', remember tbe sort of
luck the poor, girl ' played in when she
I married me.

PAXTON FIGHTS
THE JUDGMENT
Resists Effort of His Afflicted
. Children to Enforce De

A d ran* tic inctti^nt in. the litigation
tastSUtted by t&e bllrM soa and tire in
valid daogfcter cf BiUx W. Paxtan. SÂ»
noiaa Co-uaty capitalist, to compel his
to rnait-tain thejn and save them frora
wanv will b* derclop^d to-day before
Jcdgs GrAha.ia. It was ordered yester
tiay by t&- cofert that ccur.s-i repre

pleaÂ«iicg children argue tbe nserita Â«f

punished for contempt cf court for re
fusing to obey the order directing bin
to paty each of th?n SÂ»4 a month p*tnd
tn& the Â£nai adjudica.tion of aa
tioa far perraan^n' support.
That a rli=d lad-. asa a helpless sirt
should a*Jc tiiat their father, whom
they assert i* r>rh and wh^ni the court :
fea* adjudc**! able to pay, should be :
punished tor elates;"?. f<?r refusing to;
support ttera is' te itself remarkable,
but less remarkable than the i ailesa- ;
tions cf Attorney Cii&rifs F. Haaiea. !
who represents the children, as to the \
means he has dotted to defeat the )
judgment for maintenarive they have j
secured against -iim.
t*st TÂ«t alleges Attorney Hanlon.
Â«ohn. the blind son, and Rosa., the in
valid daughter, wer.t to Santa Rosa to j
ask their fath-er for aid. as the court
had decided that Dot only morally bat
legally he was fcosni to support thera.
Leading Â£.er sishrlt&s brotÂ£Â«r by t&e
liand. cays Hariion. Rcma trudged frora
tÂ«sÂ« station along the country road to
the splendid nome cf their father. Up
the drive they had once hoped would
le&d them to their own. doorway tbey
walked, two chiidrea intent upon exe
cuting- their own judgment, bat they'
were to be disappointed.
HAXLOX 3LIKES CHARGE. ,
~I charge." saiu Attorney Han lon
yesterday, "that when. t&e*e children
turned into the driveway^ leading- Sto
tfeelr father's fcont he was sitting at Ms
es_*e in that home. But as the children
approached tfce btLnds wer* drawn and
a servant was dispatched to meet Join
and Roma.
** Tour father is not at tome.' said
the servant. "He has gone ta San Fran
claco. I do cot know when &Â« will re
tcra.'
"Thus repalseÂ«i these children tamed
back to the statHn. pâ¬rm2ess. But to
day we will argue the order to show
easse why be seodd rot be punished
for contempt- Trse, Hr. Paxtoa has
secured fifteen, days in whica to pre
pare his bill cf exception on appeal te
the Sapreme Court frocx tiie orser &i
reetir-g hira to pay his chiidrea for
their support, bat in csy opialOQ this
will cot operate as & stay cf execution.
If the court holds that I .am right,
execution will Issue against fclm and
the next visit to the Paxton home at
Sonoma, will not be by his children, bet
by the Sheriff, authorized to enforce
the provisions of the law.*".
WRIT I* DENIED.
After Judge Graham was applied to
by Attorney Hanlon. representing the
:Paxton. c!lildrÂ»n. for an order that an
! execution issue against their fatner's
prcp*rty, a copy of^ the. pzdg
mtats in. both cases -aras served upon
! Paxton at his horse ia Sand Rosa. Im
mediately thereafter be fHed a petition
!in tit* Supreme GÂ»urt asking for a
' writ of prohlbltfon restrairiins' Judge
Graham from proceeding to Issue an
execution against his real estate and
restraining the court and the Judge
thereof from "lssprtsoninsr him far con
cern? r' of court in not paying the
money, on the ground that tae remedy
given to tie children by the code- was
iuade<ruate aj?d that the Legislature
failed to. provide suSclent lesal ma
chinery to compel him to pay. Ie fact,
he raised' ail the points of objection
that he had. already raised before
Judge Granans and complained > that
Judge Graham's rulings were wrong.
The Supreme Ctmrt. however, denied
tire petition for tne wriy "
Is bis petition Paxton aHegred tnat
fee ?:â¢Â»<*â¢ no ri^nt to appeal the Case.
If he is rigbt tn his contention he can
not now restrain the 'arm '.of the Sn

property ; and also reaching "after i fclsx

lic Tne Grand Jery's search f er the

sxsser E. C. l^Cngwell, an employe cf *
the newspaper. . :
LeSrigwell admitted to the Grand Jury
that be was the author of the article,
but refused to reveal the source of
his information.
Tb* grand Jurors appealed to Su
perior Judge Lawlor for advice. They
desired to know whether the re
calcitrant witness " could not b*
compelled to yield to their de
mands. Judge Lawter informed his
<ruestfee*r* that he eedd not take cosni
zanxe at the situation unless it were
taken'before him- on a cocrt proceeding-.
The only method at hand would be to
cite LeCngwen jto siaw cause why he
shouii iÂ»t be punished far contempt cf
court in refusing ta answer.

ness, was noticed there would be no action
taken BEtU tbe regaiar meeting- next
Monday. Dfetrict Attorney Bylngtan, the
legal adviser of the Grand Jury, will make
no move unto th* body reassetn&les. It

Near the Garden City
Bob Fltzsimmons \u25a0 tllpped Into town
unexpectedly last night looking:, if any
thing, more youthful and fresher them
on his last visit. He la accompanied by
his manager, Leon Friedman, and by
two valuable French poodles.
Fltz has been matched by Manager Jim
Coffroth. of the Tosemlte Club, for a
twenty-round fight with Philadelphia
Jack O'Brien. Coffroth has made his
peace with the Supervisors who opposed
him and has been promised the December
permit. The flgnt will take place in Me
chanics' Pavilion on some date between
December 20 and December 31. The ex
act date will be named by Coffroth be
fore December L
The latter paid his $1200 license early
in the year and has paid $3600 rent for
the Pavilion without having had a chance
to promote a single fight in* this city.
Fitzslmmons has not determined where
he will train, although he has some idea
of going to San Jose to prepare for this
engagement. He will secure, men, in this
city to box with him and otherwise help
him get into condition.
The fighters are to receive sixty per
cent of the gate receipts, of which sev
enty-five per cent will go to the win
ner and twenty-five per cent to the loser.
O'Brien's showing with Kaufmann

FRED E. MULHOLLAND.
The Star Ruby handicap, decided over
the Futurity course, the feature event
of the card at, Oakland yesterday, was
captured *by Johnny Millin's mare,
Princess Titania /with Sammy Green
field in the saddle. There was little
semblance of a contest about it, the
Princess leading from the start and
winning ridden out from .Barney
Schrelber's Deutschland, a 20 to 1 out
sider. .^.
Tocolaw, the 6 to 6 favorite, piloted
by AI Minder, and by long odds the best
horse in the race, ran third. Minder
got his mount cut off near the : three
furlong pole, with nothing ahead of
him but the cooling breeze â¢ being
wafted over the Berkeley mud fiats
from the Golden Gate.
He succeeded finally in making, a
head-on collision with /Deutschland,
and, taking up his mount so suddenly,
he nearly stood Letola on her head.
The latter mare was cut down in the
mix-up. Possibly Minder imagines he
is still riding in the wilds of Washing
ton or Oregon, where the "tiger" with
out stripes has his lair. It's a long,
long way from' getaway day. and the
sooner Al dispels this Illusion from his
mind the more bouquets he will receive
over the footlights.
TWO CHOICES IN FROST.'
""-Warm, summery weather attracted
another large gathering and there was
no dearth of business in the ring.
Jtist now form is not highly main
tained, prices, being governed to a
great extent by the morning trials
shown by horses. Melodius and Akela
were the onlj' . two successful choices.
Succeed, a 40 to 1 shot, upset all cal
culations, by beating the favorite, Sil
ver Sue, In the'openirig sprint for two
year-olds. E." Walsh had the mount
on the first choice and, , making -a
tardy move, the outsider won by more
than a length. The Baldwin filly La
Chuta ran third.
Served in a chafing dish, Titus was
the hot one for the five and a half
furlong sprint following. Backed
from 5 dov/n to 8 to 5 favoritism, with
Khapp in the . pilot-house, Titus
made all the â¢'. running, only to' be
nabbed and downed a. neck by James
Nealon's Royal Rogue, quoted, at 4%
to 1. "Puss" Wright rode an excellent
race on the winner. The show went
to Duelist, a SO to 1 chance from Cap
tain Rice's stable. ;'.X . â¢ '
MMI-dUll'.s A WINMCII. '
There "appeared r t'6"be considerable stir
ring about Melodius, one of nine starters
for the mile, selling" affair, with a. result
that the filly went *to the post 1 favorite
at 11 to 5. Del Coronado cut out the
pace for six furlongs, when Knapp
slipped through on the rail with the- first
choice. It looked like easy money until
Butter came with a rush on Angelica,
finishing but a neck behind Melodius at
the wire. Edgecllff backed up" early In
the game.
Eleven started . in tha \u25a0 mile and . a six
teenth selling run, Akela from the Millln
stable ruling a consistent choice. The
gelding passed Circus on the way, home,
disposing of the outsider "by a length.
Royalty got caught in the barrier at the
start, spoiling his chances. Rey Dare ran
into the show. â¢
Lady Goodrich, owned by Applegate
& Cotton, with Teddy Robinson on his
back, took the concluding mile and
twenty-yard event. The filly ran over
Bombardier in the stretch, scoring with
apparent ease. \u25a0 The favorite, Hugh Mc-
Gowan, came from Dr. Rowell's stable.
Minder rode him and after being at one
stage the combined length* of twenty
three telegraph poles out of It, descended
Into the show. â¢
i ' NOTES OF THE TRACK.
"Taking down a selling purse and a
handicap in one afternoon is showing
a 2:10 clip, isn't it?" suid Johnny Millin.
Johnny is the owner of Akela and

will probably cut in this week.

ways been considered a first-class pilot,

Every. Seal who, takes money from Un
cle Hank seemed to be playing baseball
yesterday Â«for the boot record. They all
did the best they could and their noble
efforts produced ten errors and & victory
Tor the Giants by a score of 12 to 5 that
was one of â¢' the easiest ever pulled off
aroung this village. It was a shame to
let such a game go on, but It -continued
and grew worse with age.
San Francisco . has not played such a
bad game of ball for many a moon. For
a team that stands second In the going '
and. one with a possible chance to bring
home the big flag, the performance was
a disgrace, a delusion and a snare. The
fans were farced -to sit . around and see
the ball booted around, while the Giants
glided home. ,*
The fourth* inning put the seal of fate
on the San Francisco layout. With the
aid of but three awkward looking hits,
the Giants sent a delegation of six
through. Just as soon as a man .would
get on the sacks, the Seals would com
mence to boot the leather around the
lot. They never saw a chance to let up
and it was simply one raiscue after an
other till the whole Portland team had
come to the bat and six of them made the
circuit of the sacks.
After that round the Giants never miss
ed an Inning in which they did not put at
least one man over the route. They did
not have to try hard at that, for the
going was soft and the Seals were willing
to fumble the ball every time it came
along. There was not a feature to the
game except the work of Jakey Atz at
short for the Giants. He gathered In
several that made a noise like a hit ana
also figured with the club. The score:

CHAMPION WRIGHT
WILL SHOW HIS
SKILL AT TENNIS
AMERICAN Â»" TENNIS CHAMPION.
' WHO 19 IN THIS CITY ANI> WHO
WILL PLAT HERE.^
Beals^JVrignt, the national lawn tennis
champion, arrived in town yesterday, and
followers of -the game will be given aa
opportunity to' see tennf3 as it Is played
by one of the most skillful players In tha
world. -Wright proved that he is unques
tionably the best player in the United
States when he won the challenge match
from Holcomb Ward at Newport. Wright
went through the tournament easily and
caused quite a surprise by taking Ward
Into camp Quite handily. In the Interna
tional games played In England this year
Wright made a much better showing
than any of the other Americans. Tha
new champion was looked upon for years,
as a player of great promise. His easy
victory at Newport exceeded the expecta
tions of . even his most ardent admirers.
Wright visited the coast six years ago
with Whitman. Davis and Ward. He lost
to Dr. Sumner Hardy at that time, hut
has improved greatly since then.
The' champion has been a student o<
the game for years, and even in his teens
ranked with the best players bf the coun
try. Besides being the singles champion
of the United States, Wright also holds
the doubles championship with Ward.
The champion will spend Saturday and
Sunday at the Burllngame Country Club.
On the latter date he will play an exhibi
tion . doubles with Joseph S. Tobln as a
partner. They will be opposed to Percy
MurdÂ«'ck and Grant Smith. , Wright will
not be at his best, but he will play better
tennis than has ever been seen here bo
fore.
The champion will play at the Califor
nia Club either this afternoon or Friday
afternoon. A match will probably be ar
ranged with some of the club's strongest
players. An effort will be made to get
the champion 'to play on the courts at
Golden Gate Park, but it Is by no means
certain he will find time to do so. It
would be a great thing for the game if
the coast ' cracks could play with tha
champion, as they undoubtedly would
learn ' many things.

LINER BEACHES PORT
Mariposa Arrives From Pa
peete With Passengers and
Very Large Freight Cargo
When the Oceanic Steamship Com
pany's liner Marlposa. Captain . Lawless,
left the port of Papeete. Â» the Island ol
Tahiti was dripping -with t.ie wet' of a
welcoma tropic rain. A long drought had
reduced vegetation to a, minimum. Crops
viere Buffering and the natives were about
to fell the bread-fruit trees to provide
Jodder for their cattle .when the flood
gates of the sky were flung v.-lde open
â¢and parched Tahiti got the first generous
<!rink It lias enjoyed In months. When
the MariDosa sailed the people of the
iropic port were wet. but h?..ppy. rejoic
ing in the heaven-pent 'assurance of
bountiful crops.
The Maripcsa brought the largest cargo
she has carried since f,fae was placed on
the South Sea run. T;he copra produced
<m Tahiti and adjo'Aing islands Is of
preat commercial vr,lue. Until the Marl-
TÂ»osa provided regular communication
with the mainlaua. however, the grow
ers received pocr. prices for their product
and the encouragement to the Island's
agricultural fndustry was indifferent.
Sure now of being able to reach a market
where copra, is in demand, the business of
producing it has been placed on a live
basis. The Tahiti agriculturists and deal
ers are to-day raising and selling more
â¢'oyra and at better prices than ever
b* fore In the history of the island.
The Mariposa brought 2173 tons of car-
STo, which Included 25,592 sacks of copra,
*S,SfO husked coeoanuts, 20,160 cocoanuts
in husk, 37 cases of avocas, 180 packages
of vanilla and 3 esses of coral.
During the homeward voyage the. Marl
posa ran through a â¢ school of sperm
whales. Half a hundred were counted.
As the Marioosa was passing, half a
dozen ! thrashors appeared among the
-whales and the people on the liner wit
nessed the most * wonderful rpughhouse
any of them had ever seen. The whales
wore seized with, panic. They, beat the
waters into a 'white froth for acre
around. There were battles: between
thrashers and whales and; masterly re
treats, which called to mind Russian nav
Â«l tactics. Now and then two terror
stricken leviathans would meet in. col
lision with a crash like stase thunder.
Captain Lawless, who has traveled as
many seas as the oldest and most active
of whale?, declares that he never saw
much blubber at one time in his life.
Among the nassengers were Mr. and
Mrs. A. Tasheira, who went . to Tahiti
on the Maripnsa two trips ar/o to spend
their honeymoon In the South Seas. J.
TV. Garthwaite, Mrs. Tashtjra's brother,
who went down on the last trip, returned
with the bride and groom. ' Mr. and Mrs.
Tashlera declare that the. only place on
*>arth for an ideal honeymoon ia Tahiti.
H. Taft and X. Koser. of Oakland were
passengers on the Ma.riposa. They are
friends of Collector. "Frederick Stratton.
who arranged for the revenue cutter
Golden Gate to tales the returning trav
elers from the liner- to Oakland Mole.

Him When He Goes to Trial
-Deputy County Clerk Joseph Rlordan
isurrendered himself to United States
Secret Service Agent Richard H. Taylor
yesterday morning and was formally
turned - over to ,the - custody... of United
States I Marshal Shine.
;Ou complaint of United States Secret
Service Agent John H. Helms, . a war
rant for Riordan's, arrest was Issued four
days ago by United States Commissioner
Heacock; charging - Riordan ' with con
spiring on October 16 of 'this year witn
Antonio Sousa' Martlnho and Antonio J.
Santols to issue a false certificate of nat
uralization to Isnacio Brazil.' The
secret jj service people [ learned that 1 Rlor
dan had supplied Martinho and " Santos,
with blank certificates of naturalization
from the County Clerk's office and stamp
ed -them with the seal of - the Superior'
Court. Although .the.^warrant had been,
out several days; the Deputy United
States Marshal' had been unable '.to find
Riordan at any. of his usual places of re
sort. ; Riordan declined to , make any
statement other than that he had had
nothing L to do with naturalization cases.
The prisoner was released â¢â on \u25a0 $3000 ball
bonds furnished by John J. Quinn' and
: William E. Lutz. . '. ; . ;
The charge against Santos for selling
the certificate filled in to Brazil . was dis
missed by United States Commissioner
Heacock -yesterday: at . the L request \u25a0"; of
United. States Secret Service Agent Tay
lor, who explained that be had promised
Santos Immunity "from prosecution in the
Brazil case if. he would tell the. truth
about the ring of Portuguese grafters,
who have been' engaged for years. in sell
ing fraudulent certificates of, naturaliza
tion. Martinho and Santos will be used
as witnesses for! the Government against
Riordan* â¢ . . â¢
Mads: P.. Kromann surrendered his
naturalization papers yesterday to Judge
Heacock <\u25a0 and confessed -that they were
fraudulent and that he had received them
from / Frank Johnson and William C.
Raisch/ both, of whom are under indict
ment." I John Halvorson also surrendered
his papers . for i a similar reason. 'He is
also \u25a0' a' jj Johnson T - man and , obtained his
papers from a "dummy judge, who chew
ed tobacco and drank whisky."
\u25a0-'.Walter Klmm, first officer of the Amer
ican; ship, James Nesmlth, also . surrend
ered 'his papers. He 'was naturalized as
a soldier, but served only four and a half
months, . having been discharged at ; the
end of that period for disability. His
seagoing license' has been canceled.
-: The papers of Charles E. Conden, a
Swede, were canceled for fraud. He was
naturalized on October 22, 1904, as a minor,
but he admitted yesterday that \u25a0he was
25 years old when he came to this coun
try. He Is an American chief mate no

George A. Kohn, defendant in the part>
nershlp suit brought by Thomas B.Cog
hlll for the loss -. caused \u25a0by the' alleged
stealings -their bookkeeper, Hubert' M.
Fortesque, "took- the stand in his -own
behalf yesterday. He denied at first that
he had ever had any knowledge of the
books of the firm, but afterward admitted
that he had known of the concealing of
the overdraft for $4793 in 1895 and that the
bookkeeper had done it under v his direc
tions. He: also admitted that he; had
taken out an Insurance policy, on his life
and" given it. to Fortesque, but "explained
the. act on the" ground that he was about
to , take a hunting '\u25a0, trip. ' . f . :
Kohn \u25a0 admitted that . he had written a
document in 1903. in which he swore that
the ' !4793 concealed from the firms-acc
ount i was t the amount which \he .had
insisted ,; tha t "Fortesque should carry j for
him. but should- not be entered *on the
books. -\u25a0 The annual statement also failed
to show .this \u25a0 overdraft. : He said i that
he had' paid: Fortesque | nothing for this."
Kohn r also Identified letters from For
tesque which threatened exposure unless
money "was sent. V; : - ! .

The Weather and Crops.
Tbe iroekJjr report of A. G. MrAdie. section
direction cf -the climate Bivd crop service of
the Weather Bureau, is as follows: -
Â«lear weather prevailed during the week In
tho central and northern sections, with oc
casional fogs In the coast districts. In the
Interior the days were warm ana nights cool.
In Southern Ciiliforaia the rain noted at the
clow.- of the preceding wefk continued at inter
vals until Wednesday and was followed by
\u25a0warm end clear weather. The precipitation in
th-Â» south varied from aVxiut two Inches along
the coeti to over five Inches in the foothill and
mountain districts. Light to heavy frosts oc
curred in the central and northern Darts of
th': State, but caused .no damage.
Ruin is badly needed In all Â«?ctions except
the south. Tr.e soil is too dry in most places
lor profitable u/irking. pasturage is scarce and
rattle are chewing; the lack of feed. Dairy
4ntereÂ«fs are suffr-rlnp and stock raisers fear the
dZOUCfat will last bo long that grass will not get
a Mart before cold wc-athor commences. Many
of Hie large mines in the Hlerra have been com
jjflled to suf=r>end operations on account of
thf- scarcity of water and hundreds of men
have been thrown out of employment. . In
Southern California the rainfall was quite
Cef'^raJ and was of the greatest benefit to
farmers, .orchardists and stock raisers. Plow-
Ing and needing are t>rogres.Â«lng and the
acreage in firain will b<* larger than usual.
Pasturage is already showing much improve
ment and cattle are doing well. The large
restrvo:rs show considerable increase in depth
of water.
Oranpcs in all sections are coloring rapidly
and satisfactorily, and the outlook is good for
a large crop oÂ£ excellent quality. Orange pick-
Ing and shipping are in progress except where
the fruit is always late in maturing. Wal
nuts and olives are yielding fair crops.
SACRAMENTO VALLEY. â Clear weather
pr*vaU*d during the week, with warm days
*nd cool nights. Light frpsts occurred in some
â¢ections. but caused no damage.- The drought
Is causing a scarcity of feed and In some
places Ftock are beginning to suffer. In the
mining districts the situation has become quite
serious, as the reservoirs are nearly empty and
many of thÂ« large mines have been compelled
to suspend operations. Dry seeding is still In
progress. The sixth crop of Â«lfalfa hay has
been harvested in Yuba County. All late crops
have been secured end fruit drying is com
pleted. Orances have been benefited by the
favorable weather and are coloring rapidly.
Orange picking is progressing. ; and the pros
pect Is Kood for a large crop of superior
quality.
COAST AND BAY SECTIONS.â CIear weath
er continued most of the week, with occasional
iocs alonz the coast, warm days and cool,
trvsty nights in the interior. Temperature as
low as 82 degrees occurred In the Sonoma val
ley, but r.o damage was- done to Cloverdale
oranjres or other crops. Forest fires caused
considerable damage In Sonoma County. The
long drought is causing much anxiety to farm
ers, dairymen end stock ralsem. The soil is
too dry -or profitable cultivation and the
rapid failure of pasturage is having a serious
effect en livestock and dairy products. It is
feared thct grass will â¢ not get well started
before cold weather commences. Grapes are
all picked, fruit drying is completed and most
of the late crops have been secured. Oranges
at Cloverdale continue in excellent condition
and are maturing rapidly.
SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. â Clear weather
with warm days and cool nights prevailed dur
ing the past week. Light frosts occurred gen
erally several nights, but caused- no damage.
ThÂ» grape crop has been harvested and was
irood. Lemon and orange.plcking are progress-
Ing an-3 Ehioments continue to eastern points.
Large crops of excellent quality will be har
vested. Large shipments of potatoes continue
frcm the Stockton 'district to Colorado and
southern points. One train of thirty-five cars
of potatoes v.-aÂ» shipped Friday from Stockton.
Dry plowing and tending continue. Some or
chards are being prarrd. Rain is badiy needed
for crren fwc" and farming operations. Dry
feed is Jailing, but stockjcontinue healthy and
in fair eom.-flilion. . "â¢..-\u25a0
HOtrrHERN* CALIFORNIAâ The rain at the
close of the. preceding week continued at in
tervals until Wednesday and was followed by ;
fair, wsrm weather. The precipitation varied
from about two !nch<Â«s Jn the coast region to
over five inclifs in the foothills and mountains.
As tJifr ron-ofT was very light, the rain was of
Incalculable tienefit to ranchers and orchard
irtK. The water supply In the great reservoirs
was larcly. increased. Plowing and seeding
are progressing rapidly and a. large acreage of J

Ne-nr York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. Nov. 14.â Stocks made a vig
orous recovery to-day from thÂ« decided weak
ness of yesterday. _The relaxation in tho
money market was the nominal cause of the
movemc.it, although the rates for call money
during the day indicated a degree of stringency
that had a decided restraint on any large . re
newal of speculative operations. The rate
touched was 18 per cent, as against the actual
high rate of 20 per cent yesterday, not count
ing the flurry to. 25 per .cent Just before the
close, which was regarded as having no elg-
I niflcance. But the -high rate of to-day was
I held only momentarily, and a very small amount
I of money was placed a* that rate of Interest.
Later in the day, after trie principal demand
ihad been satisfied, the rate fell below 10 per
j cent. This occurred much earlier in . }he day
than was the case' yesterday, and was the re
sult of freer offerings of funds. .The actual sit
uation of the money market therefore was con
siderably ameliorated as' compared with yester
day. The liquidation effected yesterday, of
course, was a factor in strengthening the bank
ing position. Large loans placed by foreign
capitalists also played a part. Reports were
current that placing of Canadian funds and a
movement of gold to New York from Canadian
points were factors at work in the money situ
ation. The circulation of rumors also continued
of ultimate Intervention by the Secretary of
the Treasury to eaee the situation In case of
any. threat of dangerous consequences, although
the reiterated Intention of the Secretary of the
Treasury to confine any Intended relief meas
ures to the needs of regular business borrowers
was again reported from Washington. Besides
ell this there was a growth of feeling that the
situation did not call for an extensive building
up of reserves by the banks at this time. It
was considered- that. the deficit in the legal re
serve requirement eelabliened on Saturday left
the percentage of .total reserves to deposit lia
bilities at 24.76 per cent, while, the percentage
of total reserves ever since the ilrst of Septem
ber, with the exception of the week ending Oc
tober "21 snd that ended October 8, had been be
low 26. The actual -change In the condition of the
banks, therefore, was not great aside from the
sentimental effect of the existence of an actual
deficit in legal reserves. Speculative feeling
â¢was disposed to the view that the banks were
not called upon at this time to go further than
to repair the actual deficit. The pressure upon
the money market at this time is recognized as
due entirely to the active business conditions,
supplemented by the speculative demand based
on confidence in the general business situation.
These conditions explain the extraordinary ex
pansion to which credits of the bank have been
extended, and these same conditions are looked
to to maintain confidence tn the great volume
of outstanding credits. .Nothing like distrust
has been cited as tho cause for any of the loan
contraction which has boen put into force,' but
simply the limitation of resources to meet' the
extraordinary demands for credits. However,
the demand upon the bank reserves continued,
the operations with the sub- treasury since the
last bank statement having withdrawals al
ready of $1,421,000 from the. banks.. With the
-easing of the money rate aufing.the course of
to-day there was alto a rally in foreign ex
change rates, and the prospect for an import'
movement of gold was thus dissipated for the
present. The . last prices for stocks was the
beet and closing wae active and strong at uni
form net gains . running from 1 to 2 points for
the principal stocks.

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO. Nov. 14:â Initial, quotations :n
the wheat market showed fair gains, the Ma>
option being up liii%c at BS%@SB%c. TnÂ»
market at the opening was influenced mainly
by the unexpected strength at Liverpool, the
weakness of yesterday at "Chicago having ap
parently, little, effect on the: English market.
According to a : foreign statistician theac
vance at \u25a0 Liverpool was '' the 'result , of report*
from Argentina to the effect that much dam
age had been wrought to the wheat crop in
the northern districts by '\u25a0' rains followed \u25a0< d>
frost. There was seemingly less uneasiness
here . over the money, situation ;in New, York
This lack of. anxiety was generally attributed
to the fact that ; the majority of the weak
holders had dlsposed-of their lines in the.gen
eral liquidation of I the past - few g days.' â¢ a*
the session advanced reports of \u25a0 Improved buy
ing \u25a0on : foreign . demand gave impetus to the
upward I tendency- of ; prices, i-.' At New York
twenty boat', loads f were ', reported" taken" .foi
export while a : similar amount \u25a0; was -said to
have been shipped from . Duluth to Great' Bri
tain. -\u25a0'â¢ Strength of "cash < wheat at Minneapolis
resulting from an . urgent demand from .mill
ers [ was a ' further incentive /to ..the .purchase
of . option: ."Another bullish Influence was: the
comparatively \ small - increase -in the ? worlfl's
visible supply.' As â¢' shown -by - Bradstreet'B
available stocks increased only about â¢ 1,090000
bushels for the* week, -compared ; with aw in*
creaee-of 6,500,000 bushels ror the corresrfcjia

Search of Treasure and
Demand Damage Judgment
Unfolding- slowly in Judge Sloss' de
partment of the Superior Court Is a
tale of a search of the Islands of the
Southern Seas for piraie treasure. The
â¢tory smacks of the romance of the
Â«ayÂ« when the galleons of Captain
Kidd sailed the deep to stain his cen
tury with the blood of his crimes.
It it a tale that makes men's blood
tlagle and tunes their ears to the call
of the eea, but drops them again into
the rut of the commonplace when they
consider that the fruit of all the hopes
of those who joined in this hazardous
quest Is litigation Involving a sum
that would be scorned by any of the
heroes of ancient days unless, per
haps. It be the skipper of a Malay-
Junk.
The tale of this cruise through the
opal Â»eas beyond the equator centers
round the good ship Herman. Loaded
low with provlsfonc. tools and excavat
ing implements, the Herman sailed
from Sydney. Australia, in April, 1903.
her prow presumably turned toward
'Papeete, Tahiti.. The ship was in
charge of Henry Whelan, agent for
William and Louis H. Mooser, former
ly owners of the vessel, who reside in
this city. George X. Sutton navigated
the vessel, assisted by James Brown
and a crew gathered at the far Anti
podean port, i
.â¢ For weeks they sailed the tropic
main, the captain scanning hi 6 chart
more closely as the days went by. for
where the cross that marked the place
Â«rhers the treasure lay on what was
pictured as an island there was no
Island at all, nothing: but the sweep
of the Fait sea, how deep no man of
that crew aboard even dared. to hazard
a guess. But the hopes of this crew
were too high to be easily dampened,
so in and out among the coral islands
of the region the ship was sailed, but
finally as provisions jrrew low it was
d^cidod to turn homeward.
Then a storm came up and all of the
Â«nergy of the crew, which had been
held in reserve for the thrilling labor
of unearthing golden pieces of eight
and ingots of time-tarnished silver,
was. expended in keeping: the vessel
on lier keel and the souls of the crew
within their bodies. As the storm
raged the crew forgot all about the
tnystie treasure inland that had lured
them into such dangers and only
longed for land on which to plant their
feet.
So they prevailed upon the captain
to steer hie course, not for Australia
end liome. but for Papeete, where the
ship could anchor and ride out the
Rale in safety.. After a long and
weary struggle with the elements the
Herman finally nailed majestically into
the shelter of the palm -covered isle,
and while the crew basked in the tropic
sun and strolled through the dreamy
villcge the agent of the Moosers nego
tiated for the sale of his ship. Finally
h*> accepted an offer of $8250. After
paying on" his crew and settling- for
incidentals he had 56250 left.
With this sum In his possession he

Quality Reigns Supreme
There is a quality point below which we do not go, be-
low which it is unsafe to go.
What looks like economy/is sometimes the worst ex-
travagance.
It looks like economy sometimes to take part of the wool
out of a piece of cloth and put cotton on the inside, but the
trick will show in the wear.
It looks like economy sometimes to buy a new piano on
which there is an advertised saving in price of one-half or
more, but with such a piano in your home a short while the
trick will be exposed, although it may be too late for you to
save yourself from loss. \A-v
Better to deal .only where such pianos are not handled
and .where such methods are not employed." ,
\u0084.. You, know the house of Sherman, Clay & Co., and you
know some, if not all, of the pianos they handleâ such makes
as Steinway, A. B. Chase, Estey, Emerson and others â but
if you are not intimately acquainted with all of them an in-
vestigation of pianos here will certainly prove profitable. Fail-
ure to'examine them may cost. you the difference between a
good piano â one that is thoroughly reliable in every way â and
one that is sure to prove worthless as a musical instrument.
Surely it seems to us that if you buy before seeing pianos
here you are sort of taking a leap in the darkâ your knowl-
edge is not as complete as it could be.
We have new pianos as low In price as $200. and from this

Mrs. Galle Is Charged With
Borrowing Coin From Men
She Promised to Marry

Barber and Seaman Declare
the Buxom Matron 3lade
Believe She Was Fancy Free
Mrs. JLioba Galle, a buxom German
matron, is charged by J. F. Weinerich'
and Wilhelm Simpkens, two gullible Teu
tons, with being a matrimonial bureau
all by herself. Weinerich declares that
he lavished $500 upon the lady, fondly
believing she would keep her promise
to marry him. When he went to her
apartment, 54S Howard street, Monday
night to demand matrimony or money
back. \u25a0 he discovered Wilhelm Simpkens
in the act of offering her his heart and
hand. Simpkens declares that he lav
ished $65 upon the lady. Mrs. Galle has
a husband living.
The rivals combined forces and swore
to a complaint before Judge Mogan.
charging the woman with obtaining money
under false pretenses. She has vanished
like Weinerich's and Bimpkens' dreams of
connubial bliss. * -
Weinerich met the fickle frau several
months ago. She was pining for a strong
arm to split the kindling and carry up
the coal. Weinerich was tired of the
prosaic ribsteak and the every-day,
sordid corn beef hash. He wanted some
one to fix him up noodles like he used
to eat. He suggested that the price of
a license would bring big dividends for
both.
"Mem liebes hertz." he pleaded, "Willst
dv meine frau werden?".
"Ja," replied the buxom Mrs. Galle.
Then. Weinerich declared, his sup
posed fiancee began to make "touches."
Gradually, by the "touching" process,
she relieved him of $500. Monday even
ing he went to Mrs. Galle's home.
Some one sitting beside Weinerich's
fiancee was saying. "Mem liebes hertz,
willst dv meine frau werden?"
"Ja," replied Mrs. Galle softly.
"Gott ira Himmel," shouted Weinerich.
Mrs. Galle ordered both suitors from the
room.
"She got $500 from me." explained Wein
erich when the* pair of lovelorn Teutons
were out in the street. "She said we
would furnish an apartment house."
"I gave her $65 to furnish an apartment
house," said Simpkens mournfully. The
companions in misery wended their way
to the Hall of Justice, where they ob
tained a warrant for the arrest of their
charmer.
Weinerich is a barber from Point Rich
momi-and Simpkens is a seafaring man.
Mrs. Galle was arrested lajst night and
released on furnishing $200 ball.
dered It to the Moosers, late owners of
the ship. Then he demanded his fee,
but the Moosers, ascertaining that they
had not authorized the wild search for
treasure Into the South Seas but had
ordered him to sell the, vessel before
he set sail from Australia, refused to
pay him. So he filed suit to recover
the fee he asserts is due him.
In their answer to his.cdmplaint the
Moosers tell in detail the story of the
cruise of the Herman in search of pi
rate treasure and contend that they can
easily prove that they never author
ized Whelan to -Â»t a sail on his ship
after he arrived at Australia. As
Whelan paid the expenses of the fruit
less search for gold out of the selling
price of the Herman they assert that
not only has he received all that he is
entitled to but $1234 more. For this
latter sum they demand judgment
against Whelan.
Both sides will be given fuller op
portunity to-day to explain their va
rious contentions, and then Judge Sloss
will decide whose cupidity it was that
caused the Herman to abandon the
cause of commerce and turn her prow
toward the land the chartmaker said
was the stronghold of ancient buc
caneers.'

DRIVER IGNORES HUMANE PROTEST
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
When humans beholders cnided K.
Kitane for compelling his equine wreck
to scale that portion of Pine street ly
ing: between Kearny. and Dupont, the
little brown j teamster impudently fcpld
them that they could be6t demonstrate
their pity by relieving: thfe: beast of. its
burden and conveying the\same to the
top of the hill.
"For," he declared in sour; gutturals,
"I have undertaken to deliver this load
of merchandise to Its honorable pur
chaser and my honorable word cannot
be broken and my honorable face for-
'---\u25a0\u25a0 â¢ '.
ever shamed In the sight of all honor-,
able persons. - Therefore If you honor
able kickers wish to help this old and
honorable horse you may release him
from the wagon and haul the vehicle
your honorable selves."
"But," argued the only protestant,
whose indignation was not too pro
found to permit, indulgence in argu
ment, "even if the animal were freed
from the load It would be cruelty to
drive him up this steep. ' Indeed, it is
cruelty to prolong his life." V
K. Kltane broke the.approvingr mur
mur evoked by the foregoing speech.
"If you have witnessed the progress
of the a prod and honorable horse this
far up the hillside," he said, "you have
also witnessed that it was not hurried
by me. rlndeed. you must .have seen
that every time the honorable quad
ruped faltered or exhibited other symp
tom of imminent collapse I , promptly
propped him up and allowed him to
rest until he was sufficiently recuper
ated to resume his task. Yetyou'in
sinuate that my treatment of him Is
inhumane. You grieve me much.".
So saying he pulled the props from
the horse, shouted in Japanese a com
mand equivalent to the American
whipster's "Giddap!". and . again the
animal pressed its razor-like shoulder
blades Into its collar, and shfoved and
pushed until. 'nobody would have been
surprised to see said collar "cut
through by said blades. But not an
inch of headway did the brute succeed
in making, and : finally the unpleasant
spectacle was brought to a finish by
the arrest of K. KUane. i
"The hoss ain't fit for crowbait.V said
the complaining witness /to Police
Judge Conlan. . . -
"In the land of the chrysanthemum,
the geisha and the jlnrikisha," quoth
his Honor to the defendant. -"it may
be permissible to work -a dumb beast
to cruel excess, but In this less pic
turesque country there are laws for
the prevention and punishment of that
kind of thing,' and- you have clearly
violated one of them. I'll sentence you
to-morrow."
Persons who saw the horse attempt
to climb, the hill told the court that its
average rate of speed was five yards
an hour. .
Charles Limarute, a humpback dwarf
of middle age and disproportionately
large head J and face, was E given six
months by Judge Mogan "for having
frightened women by following them
on the street and grimacing horribly
when they looked at him. Several ma

Every bluecoat. In the courtroom- glared
indignantly at Mr. Duffy,' and Bailiff Con
lon eagerly whispered to, the bench, "He's
a hop-head, you Honor, and never earned
an honest dollar In his. life.";'
"I'm disinclined to believe your story,"
said the Judge"; to the defendant, "for

are an opium ; slave, . and opium slaves
have only one ambitionâ to obtain opium."
"Oh. all rlghtey," retorted^ Mr>..- Duff y, :

comparison will: be made* between \u25a0 this
and the almost tragedy at the
old ivy-covered $ mansion "at 1661 Octavla
street, in which Thomas BelKforfeited his
life. \u25a0_-\u0084 Strangely the gamut of time dulls
not , the memory of, these strange inci
dents In the history of one of California's
pioneer families and from recollection as
keen as though they : were occurrences of
yesterday, they will again be recited in
a court of law.
4 It is Hhe ; suit instituted by Dr. Peter
Kearney to recover $25,000 from Mrs.
Teresa Bell, widow of Thomas Bell and
administratrix' of his estate, for medical
services \u2666 rendered . her â¢ and her children
; that: has recalled these Incidents of many
years ago. Dr. Kearney; asserts that he
is * well ; entitled ! to ~ the . full sum he sues
for;; Mrs. Bell: contends that while it is
true.that she is :in: his debt a small
amount, -I his claim against - her \u25a0 reaches
no such proportion as he alleges and that
she cannot be held liable for services ren
dered Marie and Fred Bell, for they have
attained their majority, and furthermore
are< not her children ; and have no rights
she is legally abound ]to respect.
UNCOVERS FAMILY SCANDAL.
All day yesterday Attorney Tauska, rep
resenting Dr. Kearney, endeavored to ad
mit inevidence the petition filed by Mrs.
Bell for letters of administration upon
the estate of her late husband. This pe
tition was filed shortly after his death
and in it she asserted that Fred and
Marie Bell, like the rest of her children,
were the Jegitlmate offspring of her mar
riage to Thomas Bell. It was many
months later, when, on the stand In Judge
Coffey's court resisting a demand of Fred
and Marie for maintenance at her hands,
she announced under oath that the claim
ants were \u25a0' not "-;- her." children, and ; that
hence their claims against her were with
out legal right.' '" |
/ The effort to; get this petition into the
record^ yesterday ; failed of result, 'how
ever, Judge Hunt holding ' that for' the
time : the same was immaterial. Another
effort Ho get : It, before the jury as legal
evidence will be; ' made to-day. The
anxiety of the plaintiff, to get this instru
ment before â¢ the jury : is due to j the . fact
that a large part of Dr. Kearney's claim
is based on treatment given Fred and
Teresa : Bell,; especially the former, on
the occasion of his serious injury - re
ferred \u25a0 to. â¢â¢â¢ . Â£?^"S'
: On the, night of April 23, 1896, Fred Bell
accompanied a young woman to the Sut

three flights of stairs he walked' with her

stories high, they stopped and engaged
in a discussion, the -nature of which, was
never revealed.* ) ;"\u25a0; "\u25a0 , .

THOMAS BELL'S WEIRD DEATH.
One'night Thomas Bell returned to his
home and walked up the broad stairway
leading . to the second story. One room
on. that floor was occupied by himself
and another by the late Mammy Pleas
ant, the aged and notorious negress that
ruled ; the Bell household for a quarter
of a century. A short time after Thomas
Bell entered the house that night his un
conscious body was picked up at the base
of the stairway to which he had plunged
from the story, above. How hÂ© came to fall
none could tell. He never regained con
sciousness, expiring a few hours after he
was found, his passing shrouded In the
prof oundest mystery.
And other * spectacular Incidents In the
life of Thomas Bell arid his -family will
be related In this suit.\ Dr. Kearney will
Insist on the full payment of his claim
and the facts as to the cause of every
Illness -he prescribed for and the nature
of every wound he dressed In the house
hold of Bell will be told. It promises to
weave a tale remarkable In the annals
of medical jurisprudence. v
