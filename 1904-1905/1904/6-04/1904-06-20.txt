SACRAMENTO, June 19.â As the re
sult of a Quarrel several weeks ago,
Roland Holmes this evening fired five
shots at William Harbinson. The shots
took effect in the abdomen. Harbinson
will die. ;Â¦ ._ - . .
"The shooting- occurred in a saloon an
Fourth between J and K streets.
Holmes was discharged from the
county hospital yesterday, after having
been treated for three weeks for - in
juries inflicted by Harbinson in an al
tercation on a public street, while both
were on a spree.
Although Harbinson is much the
Emaller in stature, he inflicted such
shocking injuries upon his antagonist
that it was feared Holmes would die.
He was made permanently deaf in one
ear and blind in one eye. while his
tongue was so injured that he has not
recovered speech since the assault.
Holmes during his confinement at the
hospital, constantly brooded over his
troubles, and several days ago sent a
note into the city to Harbinson warn
ing him that while he had not prose
cuted him in court he would take re
venge upon him for the Injuries re
ceived at his hands, and that when he
did so he would "fix him good."
Harbinson paid no attention to the
warning and was standing against a
chair in the Fourth-street saloon to
right when Holmes entered, And ap
proaching him unawares and without
uttering a sound, 'placed a revolver
against his body and emptied the
chamber of five cartridges.
As the first shot was fired Harbinson
was heard to beg Holmes not to kill
him, but the frenzied man kept up the
fire and Harbinson dropped to the floor.
Holmes was placed under arrest and
Harbinson taken to the Sisters Hos
pital. The 1 surgeons said he would
surely die.
He is a married man. while Holmes is
single. Both are middle aged.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Illinois has decided to make an ac
tive and aggressive campaign for Hitt
for Vice President. A caucus was held
to-day in the State headquarters and
a campaign in the interest of the Illi
nois Congressman was decided upon.
After a discussion between the leading
men of the delegation, it was arranged
that Senator Shelby M. Cullom should
present the name of Hitt to the con
vention and seconding speeches will be
made by at least two delegates, one
from the Middle Missippt Valley and
the other probably from New York.
After the adjournment of the caucus
it was announced by some of the Il
linois men that the seconding speeches
would be delivered by. Senator Dolllver
of Iowa and some one else yet to bo
selected. The Senator was out of the
city to-day visiting friends and could
not be seen, but members of the Iowa
delegation scouted the idea that he
would speak for Hitt. According to
them, he had received and not accept
ed the invitations to speak for the
nomination of Senator Fairbanks and
John L. Webster of Nebraska and
under the circumstances it was not
at all probable that he would second
the nomination of Hitt. Moreover,
there Is a decided sentiment among the
Iowa men in favor- of Fairbanks, al
though a number of them are for Hitt.
The Michigan delegates, after learn
ing of the statements made after the
Illinois caucus, declared they were in
CTJLLOM TO NOMINATE HITT.
There Is no doubt expressed about
the selection of Secretary Cortelyou for
chairman of the national committee,
although many men prominent In tha
party are found who do not hesitat*
to privately express some disappoint
ment that a more experienced politi
cian was not chosen.
Senator Lodge arrived from Massa
chusetts with a draft of the platform
in his pocket. He was notified that
he would* be recognized to move the
appointment of the committee on reso
lutions and this means his selection
as chairman of the committee. All In
terest In the platform centers In the
tariff plank and the sentiment 13 that
there will be a straight declaration for
protection, without promises for future
tariff revision or reciprocity.
Senator Allison of Iowa has been
consulted regarding the tariff plank
and has advised against making any
pledges for future action. It la alao
understood that such a course will suit
the President.
Two active Vice Presidential aspir
ants were about the Auditorium cor
ridors during the eveningâ John Lee
Webster of Nebraska and John W.
Springer of Colorado.
"STAND PAT" THE SLOGAN.
CHICAGO. June 19.â The Vice Presi
dency and the tariff plank In the plat
form were the principal subjects of
discussion among the delegates of the
Republican National Convention to
day.
Prom present appearances Senator
Fairbanks will be the choice for Vice
President, as a sufficient number of
leaders have declared for him and an
nounced the probable support of their
delegations for him to indicate his se
lection. The Indiana Senator was seen
for a few minutes in the corridor of
the Auditorium and was greeted by -a
throng of men. who indicated to him
their desire to see him named for sec
ond place on the ticket. He remained
non-commital, as usual, his position
being that the nomination would neith
er be sought nor refused.
The knowledge that the Senator will
not refuse has been communicated to
the delegates and has largely increas
ed the prospects for his nomination.
The movement to-day for Represent
ative Hitt seems to have been prompt
ed to some extent by those who felt
that Fairbanks should make a declar
ation. Then, again, the Illinois men
feel that, in view of the action of their
State convention, they mu3t make an
earnest effort for Hitt. It Is a fact,
however, that the recent Illness of Hitt
in Washington has dampened the ar
dor of his supporters, who acknowledge
that this will work to his disadvan
tage.
Of the stings' efficacy for the cure of
rbtumatism the chemists say their ex
periments have left no doubt. The tale
cf how the scientists conceived the idea
of experimenting with the stings is
told thus:
A farmer afflicted with rheumatism
was set upon by a swarm of bees
EJ!d frightfully stung. His face, neck
and limbs were covered by red spots
and swollen for days. When the
Fwclling subsided, to the farmer's de
light the rheumatism was cured. Sup
plemented by similar cases, this tale
came to a man who was interested in
bacteriological experiments.
The loss of its sting, if carefully
amputated, will not destroy the bee's
honey-making ability.
A special laboratory i? being con
structed near Philadelphia for the
transformation of b*Â»e stings into
terum. The stings will be transport
ed thither from bee farms in air
tight glass tubes in especially con
structed cases, so designed that the
temperature surrounding the tubes
may bÂ» kept the same as that of the
bee's body. I n its finished state the
product will be sold in small vaccine
points of the same form as anti-toxin
and smallpox virus. That an ample
Fupply of raw material may be avail
eble the company will encourage the
establishment of bee farms in Dela
ware and Chester counties in North
ern Delaware.
PHILADELPHIA, June 1?.â After a
leng exr^riment by bacteriologists in
their employ, an incorporated firm of
wholesale chemists of this city has sent
sg?nts to Texas with instructions to
obtain al! the bee stings they can for
medicinal purposes. An order for 60.000
Htings was placed with one bee farmer
in that Ftate. A serum for injection
through the skin will be made from the
TOtent fluid with which the tiny weap
ons are charged.
EEEVILLE. Tex.. June 19. â A new
apiary product became known through
the receipt of an order here from a
Philadelphia firm of chemists for
10.000 bee stings. The acids which
the poison sacks of bees contain is said
to.be valuabJe in the manuÂ£acturÂ£,-pf
a remedy for rheumatism.

CHEFU, June 19. â Midnight?-- There is current here a Chinese rumor that the Japanese have captured one of the inner forts at Port Arthur, losing 1000
men in the engagement. It has no{ been confirmed.
TOKIO. June 20. â A report from Vice Admiral Karmmura, forwarded from a port whose jiame the naval board will not reveal, states that thus far he has failed to discover the Russian Vladivostok fleet. It is said that the Tokio
naval tacticians have received positive assurance that the squadron has not returned to Vladivostok. in'Svhich event it is now placed between two powerful divisions of the Japanese riavy. While Kaminiura continues the quest for the Russian
cruisers at sea. another strong squadron is awaiting its arrival off the harbor of Vladivostok. It is believed here that' the real object of the Russian cruisers is to divert the attention of the Japanese fleet at Port Arthur in order to permit the
Russian fleet now '"bottled" there to escape. Then, having formed a junction, the combined fleet would attempt to go .back to Vladivostok, or, possibly, to return to Russian waters. Dense fogs that have prevailed for nearly a week off
Japan's coast have enabled the Vladivostok snuadron to elude Kamimura. '.. i *'Â¦?Â¦> V . Si

Former Postmaster General Declines
to Discuss Threatened Action for
Defamation of Character.
WASHINGTON, June 19.â James N.
Tyner, former Postmaster General,
awaits some answer to his letter asking
President Roosevelt to clear him from
the reflections contained in the White
House review of the Bristow postal
scandal report.
To inquiries about the report that he
would sue the President for $100,000 for
defamation of character unless a re
traction were forthcoming, General Ty
ner replied he had made no statement
that he intended to bring such a suit.
He would not say whether he contem
plated 6uch action, but Intimated that
he might have a, further statement to
make in the . ise. It is believed that
General Tyner Is inclined to let the
story that he will sue the President
gain ground in the hope that it may
influence Roosevelt to withdraw his
charges.

March 11, 190t7""have been completed.
I The average time of building these
I ships has been a little over three years,
I and the dockyards have almost kept
pace with the contractors. The Essex,
Kent, Suffolk and Cornwall were built
at dockyards, and the Bedford, Ber
| wick, Cumberland, Donegal, Lancaster
I and Monmouth in private yards. The
hulls are identical, of 9S00 tons displace
ment, and the horsepower of machinery,
stipulated at 22,000, was calculated to
give a speed of twenty-three knots.
Some difficulty was experienced with
the earlier built ships in attaining this
speed, for the Kent never got above 21.7
and the Bedford, Essex and Monmouth
attained only 22.7, 22.79 and 22.53, re
spectively, but in the later ships the
calculated speed has been considerably
exceeded, the Lancaster making 24.1
and the Suffolk 24.7 knots. . -. .
There are several interestlng f facts to
be noted in connection with these ships.
In the first place, in a lot of ten iden
tical ships there is a grand opportu
nity for comparison of cost, time and
workmanship of those built in the dock
yards and those built by contract. The
average" estimated cost of the ships
built at the dockyards was given on
April 1 last at $3.S43,500, the highest be
ing the Cornwall at $3,938,200, and the
lowest the Kent at $3,669,000. The six
contract built shi?s averaged $3,707,500,
the highest $3,884,340 and the lowest
$3,545,425. All the engines were fur
nished by contractors, and those deliv
ered at the dockyards ranged from
$1,290,000 to $1,050,000, while those put
Into contract built ships varied from
$1,400,000 to $1,050,000. Five firms sup
plied the machinery. Hawthorn & Les
lie delivering three sets of engines,
namely, for the Kent, Lancaster and
Cornwall. In the performance of these
ships the results varied greatly. The
question of the relative merit of water
tube boilers of the Belleville, Niclausse
and the Babcock & Wtlcox types again
presents itself, for the Belleville was
fitted in seven ships, the Niclausse in
twoâ the Suffolk and Berwick, and the
Babcock & Wilcox in the Cornwall. The
engines for the Lancaster and the Corn
wall were supplied by Hawthorn &
Leslie, but the speed attained by the
Lancaster, fitted with Belleville boilers,
was 24.01 knots, against 23.687 knots of
the Cornwall, with Babcock & Wilcox
boilers, thus demonstrating that the
Belleville Is not nearly as bad as al
leged by its opponents.
RESULTS OF CHANGES.
To a limited extent the United States
navy has had the same experience of
varying results with ships and their
engines. The bnilders have received
their plans for hulls and machinery
from the Navy Department and built
according to specifications, but as
work progressed changes were made
here and there which singly were of
slight importance, but in the aggregate
affected the final result. In the Oregon,
Massachusetts and.,J[ndlana there was
a marked .difference " # "alnd' subsequent
ships have likewise proved more or less
speedy, although built on the same, de
sign. The Oregon class was designed
for' 9000* horsepower and 15- knots
speed, but the trials gave 9738 horse
power and 15.547 knots for the Indiana;
10,415 horsepower and 16.21 knots for
the Massachusetts, while the Oregon
developed 11,111 horsepower and 16.79
knots; In a steam trial various causes
affect the result; state of weather and
sea. coal used and the efficiency of the
engine-room personnel. But in the long
run as years pass on and the .parts
of the machinery naturally wear out
two questions will arise, namely:
Whether the workmanship has been in
accordance with the spirit of the speci
fications and whether any undue de
terioration is chargeabte to inherent
bad work or through want of proper
care and attention. In these respects
the Oregon -has proved that work: on
her was well done, that she has been
well cared for and that she Is still
leading the other ships, which have de
teriorated and are no longer to be con
sidered as being in the Oregon class.
THE "PESKY" SUBMARINES.
Those "pesky" submarine boats are
causing more trouble to the personnel
of all navies than any other contriv
ance yet devised for naval warfare.
The "battle of the boilers" and the
"Gun vs. Armor" are trivial affairs in
comparison. The advocates of the sub
marine and its opponents are naturally
doing their level best in evolving new
ideas to improve on methods of attack
and defense, and the trials going on
in Portsmouth Harbor are Interesting.
The latest device to trap a submarine
was successfully tried and consisted
of a fine wire net about 250 feet in
length and seven feet deep rigced on
long booms attached to steam
launches. The submarine attacked the
net in vain for several ho irs, finally
became entangled in the meshes and
acknowledged defeat by coming to the
surface-
M. Bertin. director of naval con
struction-in the French navy, has sub

have no reason to envy Great Britain.
We are the first builders of the world
from the point of view of strength,
navigability and finish. The English
are only superior to us in one point â
that of rapidity of construction. They
also have an advantage over us in the
large sums at their disposal for naval
construction."

As the result of a collision between
an outbound car of the Castro street
line and a southbound Sixth street elec
tric car at the corner of Sixth and
Market streets last evening Matt J.
Breen of 16 Laguna street sustained
sc-rious injuries and the lives of a score
j of passengers were jeopardized. From
i the fact- that the cars came together
j with terrific force it Is regarded as
j miraculous that only one was hurt. ;
I The accident, which occurred shortly
| before 6 o'clock, was due to a mlslnter
i pretation of signals on the part of the
i operators of both cars. According to
I the rules of the United Railroads cars
I on both lines are brought to a full stop
; at the crossing. This course was fol
lowed, but in some manner the motor
man of the electric car threw on the
: current at the same time the Castro
street car started, with the result that
the ; vehicles came together with a
crash.
Breen was sitting on the dummy of
the cable car, deeply interested in read
ing a current periodical. He was un
aware of the. danger until the crash",
and then it was- impossible \to Jump.
The force of the collision broke the
glass fronts of both cars and splintered
the woodwork. The Castro street car
was crowded and the passengers were
thrown Into a great state of excitement.
.The streets in the vicinity were
thronged and. a large crowd soon gath
ered. Breen was extricated from the
wreckage and removed In the ambu
lance to the Central Emergency Hos
pital. Upon examination it was found
that he had sustained a compound frac
ture of the left leg below the knee,
extensive lacerations on the same limb
and a number of contusions and bruises
on the hands. He was later removed
by the United Railroads to the South
ern Pacific Hospital.

NEW PAY SYSTEM.
A new pay system, affecting all sal

effect in the United States on July 1.
A year's pay will be divided into twelve
equal parts and in -making-payments
for a fractional part of a. month, one
thirtieth of the monthly compensation
is to be the. rate each. day.. Thus per T
sons serving a month having thirty^
one days, err February of twenty-eight

twelfth of an annual salary and de
ductions are made- on this same basis
of thirty days to the month.
The torpedo boat O'Brien, built by
Lewis Nixon, had another unsuccessful
speed trial on June 10. The contract
of May 4, 1898, called for a speed of
26 knots, to be maintained for one hour,
but this was reduced two years ago
to 24 knots. The last trial had to be
abandoned after a ten-minutes run
owing to weakness developed in one of
the blowers. This defect is now being
remedied and another .trial may come
off before July 1. The O'Brien and
Nicholson are the last of the twelve
torpedo boats contracted for in 1898,
to be completed, and should have been
delivered, September 26, 1899.

BRITAIN CONDEMNS OLD SHIPS.
Three old ships in the British navy
have been condemned as useless for
any further service and are to be sold
at auction. They are the Vblage, a
corvette of 30Â£0 tons, built in 1869. and
the Comus and Curacao, each of 2380
tons, built in 1878. Thdy were removed
from the effective list about four years
ago and were until recently utilized as
harbor vessels. These ships are the last
of the Heet of eighteen vessels built be
tween 1868 and 1878 an'd which have
been of more service .than any later
built unarmored cruising ships. They
were of the sheathed' class-^-that is,
metal hulls sheathed with wood" plank
ing and coppered. The idea originated
with Sir Edward J. Reed, chief con
structor in the British navy, who built
the frigate Inconstant and later the
Raleigh and Shah. The builder's the
ory was that vessels designed for cruis
ing purposes, and in order to maintain
as nearly as possible. their trial speeds,
would be more economical in coal con
sumption if slieathed and coppered than
with an ordinary painted metal
tom, and this theory proved successful
in practice, notwithstanding the crudity
of. the system as first applied. Six
sheathed corvettes, varying from 4130 to
3080 tons, were* built between 1869 arid
1876, and nine Smaller corvettes, known
as the "C" class, were launched in 187S.
The latter ships had steel hulls, while
the earlier ones were built of iron. The
speed of the Inconstant class was about
16.5 knots, that of the large corvettes 15
knots and that of the "C" class 13
knots, and this fleet was found espe
cially serviceable on foreign stations,
where unsheathed vessels would have
been less efficient and more costly to
maintain, owing to limited docking fa
cilities and consequent additional coal
bills. The "C" class in particular proved
efficient ships. One of these, the Co
mus, served for many years on the Pa
cific station and was frequently seen in
this harbor. The period of active ef
fective service of these eighteen ships
has j ranged from twenty-eight years
down . t,Q twenty-one years, a record
that is not likely to be excelled by ves
sels of modern construction.
The original Trafalgar prize list was
sold at a London auction, with a. lot of
other books and manuscripts, two
weeks ago. The list was in manuscript,
of two volumes folio, giving the amount
of- money awarded to individuals of the
various ships' companies engaged in the
battle of Trafalgar. It was sold for $180.
SOME MODERN WARSHIPS.
There are twelve battleships of mod
erate size built or under construction
for the navies of Austria, Germany,
Great Britain and the United States.
In the American ships the plan of mak
ing gun power paramount is adhered
to, while in the foreign ships higher
speed and lighter guns is the object
aimed at. The contrasts in guns and
speed between the Idaho class in the
United States navy and those of foreign
navies â notably the Swiftsure in the
British- navy â are quite marked, for the
British ship has three knots greater
,epeed on 1200 tons less displacement,
and only an apparently Bmall sacrifice
of gun fire. The American battery is,
of course, the most effective because of
its longer range and harder hitting
power, but foreign designers evidently
believe that guns of smaller caliber,
which can be more rapidly served, an
swer the purpose of dismounting the
battery guns of an adversary. The

WILL ATTACK HAICHENG.
Strong Reinforcements for Knroki's
Army Are Advancing.
LIAOYANG. June 19.â The Jap
anese continued to press the Russian
forces returning from the battle of
Vafangow on the night of June 16.
They had remained at Vafangow all
day and at night persistently pushed
forward and tried to get around the
Russian right wing, which had borne
the brunt of such heavy fighting the
previous darv.
A terrific thunderstorm burst at
night, rendering the roads almost im
passable. They were bad for the Rus
sians and equally so for the Japanese,
who were unable to overtake the Rus
sian right. The Russians, therefore,
were enabled to retire gradually to the
north.
It is said here that General Kuroki.
with the main force of the Japanese, is
at Siuyen. It is said he intends uniting
with the force advancing from the
south and make a combined attack on
Haicheng.
Further details of the fighting on
June 15 show that the Russian advance
on the Japanese position, when It was
hoped that Lieutenant General Stakel
berg would drive back General Nodzu's
,army, was a brilliant affair. Soon af
ter dawn the Japanese were discover
ed in strong force on a hill north of
Dyaiwo. The Infantry was well en
trenched and supported by artillery.
The Russian left was thrown forward
with reserves to clear the hill. They
had a little over a mile of open country
to cross, their only cover being two
small hills and two shallow valleys.
The Japanese concentrated a deady fire
as soon as the Russians reached the
open.
The "Russians formed in open order
and rushed from point to point, taking
advantage of every depression in the
ground, dropping and firing, then ad
vancing again until they gained a hill,
where they halted for a breathing
space.
Over the hill the Japanese threw
shrapnel, which burst with deadly ef
fect. Some squadrons lost every of
ficer killed and half the men wounded.
The battle then became a hand-to
hand fight, with stones and gun butts,
and the remainder of the Russians, tak
ing advantage of this diversion, gained
the shelter of a neighboring ravine, but
were unable to hold the position in the
face of the rain of shells and shrapnel
concentrated there by the Japanese
batteries.
The Japanese heavy guns silenced
the artillery supporting the Russian
attack. Thirteen Russian guns were
smashed to atoms and their horses
killed. A majority of their gunners
weer killed or wounded.
The Japanese at this moment de
livered their main attack. The whole
division- was thrown against the Rus
sian center and two divisions around
the right flank. The hard pressed
right held out until 11 o'clock in the
morning, when two regiments rushed
to its assistance. The whole force
then advanced, cheering, and actually
rolled the Japanese advance back, but
General Nodzu poured in fresh troops,
regiment after regiment.
! The Russian commander saw that
he was being enveloped and rallied
his reserves and retired in order.

P.aron Berthald. John Dunsmure. Kdith
Mason. Kate Condon and Willard Sims
are the new folk and without exception
valuable.
Wlllard Sims, who follows Barnabee
as the Sheriff of Nottingham, has a
lot more than his courage to commend
him. 'Tis an ungrateful task. To
follow a comedian like Barnabee, in a
part that he is identified with as Hob
ton is with kisses, is to challenge a
country-wide prejudice. Any other
sheriff is in a sense a usurper. One
cannot help the attitude. But had
had there been no Barnabee we could
have got along quite comfortably with
a Sims. He is an accomplished and easy
comedian, his humor, perhaps of a vin
tage less dry than Barnabee's, his
drollery less unctious. One misses, too,
the elder comedian's physical sufficien
cies and the soft, gentlemanly, blar
ing villainy of his Sheriff, but
Pirns is perhaps funnier when drunk
than Barnabee. It is a small master
piece of tipsy navigation when he fol
lows Dame Durden into the cottage.
And. af I have said before, Mr. Sims
is throughout sufficient and accom
plished in the part, sings perforce
about as well as his august predeces
sor and is excellently worth his salt.
Barron Berthald needs no introduc
tion to a San Francisco audience as
B comedian. Last night's was his first
local anpearance as such. Still, the
Berthald big fact is the singing, the
voiee methods are still those, smooth,
fine, fluent, that we knew in the sing
er's grand opera days. Comedy sits
somewhat uneasily upon Mr. Ber
tha Id's brow. His is a very mild brew
of humor. And he lacks something
of gayety, da*h, picturesqueness. I'm
not sure that I like his mustache,
either! Otherwise â and there's all of
the lovely pinging:, some tender and
graceful acting, otherwise â his Robin
Hood is much that fancy paints. His
ringing is Indeed delightful, the voice
as fresh as his sane and cultured
method insure*, smooth, full and
sympathetic to the last* requirements.

perhaps not always equaled.

as freshly as the peep of a morning
daisy. IU music is as lyrical, humor
ous and atmospheric as the story.
Charmingly they have put it on. too.
Ferris Hart man has done good things
as a comedian, but his t accomplish
ments as a stage manager constitute
a dangerous rivalry. The whole per
formance went with rare smoothness
and snap. There is a "light" mau with
ideas, too â fo^ example one gets none
of the blue and violet horrors that in
old Tivoli days used to stalk abroad as
â¢"moonlight." And there has been an

(iivc Audience a Treat
in "The Prince of Liars.*'
The weight proved too much for the
structure, and sand, wharf and all
went over into the bay; At the time of
the accident the crew of the schooner
was engaged In dumping the sand on
the dock and teams were attempting
to haul the material away as fast as
possible. About 100 tons had been un-.
loaded. One of the wagons, with horses
attached, was backed up against the
pile and was almost loaded. When the
wharf fell in it left the wagon standing
on the very brink of the opening. Had
the break been six Inches nearer,
wagon, driver and horses would have
gone down into the swirt ebbing cur
rent running at that time. As it was,
the driver had to jump for his life.
The only thing that saved the team
was the fact that it happened to Just
be on the edge of the planking that
rested on the capping of the piling. On
and about that portion of the dock that
caved in there were nearly fifty men
and their escape was almost miracu
lous. As it was, they all received a
scare they will not soon forget.
The water is very deep at that point
and the current very swift. Had any of
the men been entangled with the fall
ing tpass of beams, planks and sand.
It would have been impossible to save
them.

landed there from a small bay
schooner. The sand was to have been
used by the San Francisco Drydock
Company, which owns the wharf, on

Old Time Straw Hats.
In these daya there are hundreds of
factories kept busy during a good part
of the year making straw hats. It was
not ever thus. In the early part of the
last century there were fewer factories
in this country than now and many
things were made by hand that to-day
are the work of machinery. This was
especially true of the braid for straw
hats. Rye straw was commonly used,
although wheat was also- In demand.
But the rye straw had longer stems
and was more easily handled.
In driving along the country roads,
in Massachusetts particularly, late in
the summer, one would see great
bundles of the straw hanging on the
fence to dry. When the sun and the
wind had done their share of the work.
It was placed In casks where sulphur
was burned until it was bleached to
a pale yellow. Then it was split Into
narrow widths suitable for braiding.â

Special Diipatch to The Call
PHILADELPHIA, June 19.â On the
historic spot at Valley Forge, where
Washington and his "gallant boys of
'76" suffered In order that the United
States might become a nation. Presi
dent Roosevelt ,to-day delivered a no
table address. This was "evacuation,
day," and the anniversary was cele
brated appropriately in the # little edi
fice that has been erected on what is to
be the spot of the Washington Memo
rial Church. It was to add his sympa
thy and encouragement to the project
of marking the spot by a suitable me
morial that President Roosevelt made
his address.
For the President the day was a busy
one. He spent the morning in com
pany with Attorney General Knox,
Mrs. Roosevelt and Mrs. Knox in driv
ing over the ground made historic by
Washlngton and tils men. They visited
the headquarters of Washington, the
President insisting on paying the small
fee which all visitors are charged for
viewing the place.
The camp ground and battlefield
were examined carefully. A visit also
was paid to the first house in this coun
try occupied by Audubon, the natural
ist.
From Valley Forge the President and
party returned directly to Attorney
General Knox's home.
The night was passed without note
worthy incident at Valley Forge farm.
The President and party will leave the
farm to-morrow morning, taking their
special train for Washington.
Several hundred persons had assem
bled at the Washington Memorial
Chapel, where President Roosevelt
spoke this afternoon, but only a part
of them could gain entrance, as its ca
pacity is very limited. The President
said in part:
It Is a noteworthy thing that this State of
Pennsylvania should have wtthin lta borders
the place which marks the two turning points
In our history â Gettysburg, which saw the
hlrh tide of the rebellion, and Valley Forge,
which saw the getting beyond the danger
point of the Revolution.
There have been two great crises in our
history, two crises, where failure meant the
absolute breaking asunder of the nation, one
the Revolutionary war, one the Civil war.
â¢ - â¢ â¢ There have been other crises than
that T.-hich culminated in the great war for
independence and the treat Civil war; there
have been creat statesmen and Rreat men
at other periods of our national history, but
there has never been another deed vital to
the welfare of the nation save the two, th*
deeds of those who founded and th* deeds
of those who saved the republic. There never
has been another man whose life has been
vital to the republic save Washineton and
Lincoln. â¢ â¢ â¢ It is a (food thing of these
landmarks of our history â Gettysburg and
Valley Forge â one should commemorate a sin
gle tremendous effort and the other what we
need on the whole much more commonly and
what I think is on the whole rather more
diincuit to do, long sustained effort. Only
men with a touch of the heroic In them could
have lasted out that three days' struggle at
Gettysburg. Only men fit to rank with the
great men of all time could have beaten back
the mighty dnslaught of that gallant and won
derful army of Northern Virginia, whose final.
supreme effort faded at the stone wall on
Cemetery Ridge on that July day forty-one
years ago.
But after all. hard though It is to rise to the
supreme height of self-sacrifice and of effort
at a time of crisis that iÂ« shortly to rise
to it" for & single great effort, it Is harder
yet to rise to the level of a crisis when that
crisis takes the form of needing constant,
patient, steady work, month after month, year
after year, when, too. it does not end after a
terrible struggle in a glorious day. when It
means months of gloomy effort steadfastly en
dured and triumph wrested only at the very
When two lessons are both indlsnensable it
seems hardly worth while to dwell more on
one than on the other. Tet I think that as
a leonle we need more to learn the lesson of
Valley Forse even than that of Gettysburg.
I have not the slightest anxiety that this
people if the need should come in th? future
will be able to show the heroism, the supreme
effort that was shown at Gettysburg, though
it may be well that it would mean a sdrr.pln
two years of effort checkered by disaster to
lead up to It.

WASHINGTON,. June 19.â Much In
ternational importance now surrounds
the brief speech of Commander Isam
Takeshita, naval attache of the Japan
ese legation, at the sixth annual dinner
of the American Asiatic Association at
Sherry's on June 1, when Prince Pu
L.un of China was the guest. Count
Casslni, the Russian Embassador, has
called this speech to the attention of
Secretary Hay. He has requested that
the attention of M. Takahira. the
Japanese Minister, be called to the act
of his subordinate.
The .Embassador pointed out to Sec
retary Hay that Prince Pu Lun, a
young and keen observer, hearing the
tumultuous applause at the conclusion
of this speech, would judge that, de
spite the declared neutrality of the
United States, this, nation was enthu
siastically friendly to Japan. This, he
feared, might have a dangerous effect,
upon the preservation of Chinese neu
trality.
Count Cassinl told Secretary Hay
that if a member of the Russian em
bassy, similarly placed, had so far ex
ceeded his liberties as a diplomat he
would have him sent out of the country
within twenjy-four hours. The Embas
sador further declared the dinner could
not be deemed a private affair. The
presence of so many representatives of
the American and Chinese governments
rendered it impossible to be divested of
official character.
Secretary Hay promised to give the
matter due and immediate considera
tion.
Special DUsatch to The Call.
- A dispatch from â¢ -. Petersburg,
dated June 18, said the total Russian
losses at the battle of Vafangow
(Telissu) were about* 2000 men. Includ
ing more than fifty-five officers. The
Russian forces which took Â«art In this
fight were described as marching to
the northward and It was said that
the Russians had forty-two battalions
engaged^ against forty-four Japanese
battalions, and that the Japanese had
great superiority in artillery, having
more than 200 guns.
Another report, frora Liaoyang, also
dated, June 18, said the Russians had
sixty guns In action at Telissu, op-"
posed to 100 Japanese guns. . ,
The Japanese casualties reported up
to noon of June 17 aggregated about
000 men. Including eight officers killed
and I fourteen officers wounded.
General Oku concludes his report
modestly and loyally with these words:
'â¢The success In carrying superior
positions and routing the enemy was
due to the influence of the reigning
Emperor."
The Japanese left succeeded In am
bushing 900 Russian infantrymen who
were discovered retiring toward Wuch
iatun. They sent two companies of In
fantry and one battery of artillery
to a hill east of Hongchiatun, and the
Russians were completely entrapped.
Many of the enemy at this point were
killed or wounded.
* In his report General Oku says the
Russians began the fight with twenty
five battalion's of infantry, seventeen
squadrons of cavalry and ninety-eight
guns. They were reinforced several
times, but the number of reinforce
ments is not known. The Russian
casualties are not known with exact
itude. The Japanese right found and
buried 600 of the enemy's dead and the
other columns had not reported. Seven
Russian officers and 300 men were
taken prisoners.
In the meantime the Japanese right
was suffering. The Russian left had
been reinforced until their numbers,
were greater than the opposing Japa
nese. General Oku was twice forced to
order up infantry reserves. The Rus
sians made a series of desperate coun
ter attacks, and when the situation was
most -critical Japanese cavalry swung
around the Russian left and struck the
enemy on the flank. At this time ad
ditional Russian reinforcements had ar
rived, and the Russians held their po
sition with dogged determination until
their front and both flanks were under
fire. Then they broke and fled. The
Japanese cavalry pursued the enemy
for a short time, but the roughness of
the country made it necessary soon to
abandon the pursuit, v :;.-.-..
RUSSIANS ARE AMBUSHED.
"When dawn of the 15th broke the
field of battle was obscured by fog. but
the artillery opened early. A portion
of the Japanese middle column ad
vanced-to the north side of a bend in
the Fuchu River. Here these men were
greatly exposed to the enemy's fire, but
a force of infantry and artillery was
hurried forward and relieved them. At
9:30 o'clock this relieving force seized
a point to the west of Wengchiatun.
and in co-operation with the middle
column drove the Russians from Ta
fangshen. The Russian batteries post
ed at Lungtanshan and Lungwangtiao
poured a heavy fire into these forces,
but in s?r>ite of this shelling the middle
column and the men who were sent for
ward to relieve the force at the bend in
the Fuchu River climbed the heights
ahead of them and quickly mastered
the situation.
General Oku started from a line
marked by Pulandien and the Tassa
River on June 13. His right column
moved along the Tassa River, his main
column along the railroad and his left
column by a road leading through
"Wuchiatun. Suchuankon and Tahoai.
The Japanese cavalry started from
Pitzewo over a road leading through
Shunzo and the small bodies of Rus
t-ians opposing this advance were
brushed away. The left column reach
ed Nachialing on June 14 and the main
or middle column and the right col
umn, keeping in touch with each other,
reached a line between Chiaochiatun
and Tapingkou, seven and a half miles
south of Telissu. the same day.
The Russian forces then held a line
between Tafangshen and Lungwang
tiao. The entire Japanese line ad
vanced and at 3 o'clock In the after
noon the Japanese artillery opened fire.
The Russians had ninety-eight guns
and they replied with spirit until dark
ness put an end to the artillery duel.
During the night of the 14th the
Japanese right column seized a hill be
tween Tsongchlotun and Wengchlatun,
and the middle column occupied a hill
to the west of Tapingkou.
BATTLE IN THE FOG.
| From their positions on the right and
j left, in the hills which flank this val-
I ley. General Oku drove the Russians
j down into the valley. The Japanese
general carried first the enemy's right
and then his left. The fight at the
left of his line was the most desperate
of the day. The Russians held this
position with desperate determination
and fled only when they were almost
completely enveloped. The field had
been disputed all day and when the
Japanese reached It 600 of the enemy's
j dead were found there.
I GENERAL OKUS ADVANCE.
TOKIO, June 19.â General Oku, the
victor of the battle of Nanshan Hill on
May 26, fought and won the battle of
Telissu (Vafangow, according to the
Russian designation) on June 15.
There is a strong similarity between
the two lights. At Telissu the Japan
ese had to drive the Russians from two
hills, while at Nanshan the enemy oc
cupied but one hill. The Russian posi
tion at Telissu was superior to that of
the Japanese and equalized the Japan
ese advantage in numbers. The Rus
sian position extended from east to
west and crossed the narrow valley
through which run the Fachou River
and Ihe railroad.
The Cossacks say that the inhabi
tants were well disposed toward the
Russians and sold them food and for
age readily and that they preferred
the Russian coin to the Chinese notes.
Many Kflreans, armed and led by Jap
anese officers, constitute the rear guard
of the Japanese army.
The raiding party came into contact
with the Koreans frequently and some
times there were several skirmishes
daily. There was some heavy fighting
and one battle lasted all day long, as
the result of which, the Korean said,
the Japanese lost fifty killed. The
Cossacks were eventually repulsed by.
a superior force of Japanese cavalry,
which was sent out to cut them off at
the Yalu and which outmarched and
outmaneuvered them. The raiders
crossed safely. They destroyed two
Important bridges, cut the telegraph
wires wherever they could and seri
ously interrupted communication north,
south and west of Anju.
The crops in Korea, the Cossacks say,
are In splendid condition and the
country is prosperous owing to the
large circulation of Russian money.
The Koreans complain much of the
cruelty of the Japanese army.
Manchurian Chinese report that a
number of Chinese runners were killed
while trying to pass the Japanese lines,
and that all the letters which they car
ried fell Into the hands of the Japanese.
MUKDEN, June 19.â A raiding party
of Cossacks just returned from two
months in Korea, brings verbal news,
regarding the Japanese positions, ac
cording to which the Japanese forces
on the Yalu River have become de
cidedly weak, owing to the confidence
of the Japanese commanders based on
the rÂ«Wults of the first .fight.

NEW YORK, June 19.â The offlclal
notice to the stockholders of the South
ern Pacific Company informing them of
the plan to issue $100,000,000 of prefer
red stock was not distributed until af
ter the close of business on Saturday.
Unfortunately, the document doe's not
contain anything that might win the
support of dissatisfied stockholders
who have already expressed disapprov
al of the plan. On the contrary, the
bald resolutions of the board of direct
ors is presented, stating in effect that
thÂ« capital stock will be increased one
million by the issue of one million
chares of preferred stock and that the
holders of this stock shall be entitled
"to dividends at such rate, not exceed
ing seven per cent, as shall be declared
by the board of directors." The reso
lution goes on to say that the stock
ehall be convertible into common stock,
ehare for share, at any time,
and shall be redeemed at the option of
the company after July 1, liK)5, for five
years at {115 a ehare.
In these days of distrust of financial
operations of any magnitude, it would
teem highly advisable for the manage*
ment askiug its stockholders to author
ize an Issue of JlOO.OuO.OOO in preferred
obligations to make some statement of
the condition of the company and the
purposes for which the stock is issued.
In the Southern Pacific circular, how
ever, the stockholders are asked to era
power the directors to sell or issue
$100,000,000 of preferred stock in such a
manner and at such times as the di
rectors may authorize or determine.
There is no statement made giving the
*xtent of the floating debt of the com
pany to pay which, it Is generally be
lieved, the new plan has been launched.
Neither is it definitely stated what divi
dends the preferred stock will pay.
The stock is non-cumu:ative, and it
may so happen that if the exigencies of
the occasion demand two per cent of
Hie preferred stock or the limit, seven
per cent, may be had at the direction
of the board of directors. Further,
.stockholders are not Informed how
much stock is to be issued in the im
mediate future.

dering down a steep grade to-day at
the rate of ninety miles an hour, a
Baltimore and Ohio passenger train
ran through an open switch, col
liding with a freight train and re
sulting, in the injury to over sixteen
persons, three of whom may die.
The seriously Injured: John Eisen

The severely Injured include Rer.

Vice Admiral Kamimura's squadron
was lying off Tsu Island when the
raiding Russians reached Okino Island.
Kamlmura immediately started In pur
suit of the enemy, but rains obscured
the sea, and an electrical storm Inter- ;
fered with hjs system of wireless tele
graphy. Vice Admiral Kamimura is a
splendid officer, and the only possible
Indictment against him is one of lack
of good luck.
The Japanese generally magnify the
Importance of this Russian raid, which
has no material effect upon the war.
It was a desperate venture, and it is
believed here to have succeeded cmly
through blind luck.
The Yawata and the Ansei, two sail
ing ships, were sunk by the Russians
on Thursday between Ko Island and
Okushlri Island, off the west' coast of
Yezo and north of the Tsugaru Strait.
Thirty-seven survivors reached K ?ashi
on Thursday afternoon. This makes a*
total of five Japanese ships sunk or
destroyed by the Russian raiders.*' '
The raid of the Vladivostok squadron
has brought an unwarranted amount
of criticism upon Vice Admiral Kami
mura from the Japanese, and his fail
ure to catch the Russians in the fog
off Gensan, Korea, when the Japanese
trasport Kinshiu was sunk on April
26, with a loss of about 200 men, has
been recalled. Some officials even de
clare that if Vice Admiral Kamlmura
falls to catch the Russian vessels be
fore they reach Vladivostok he should
either resign from the Navy or commit
suicide. The popular demand for hi3
replacement is growing, but the public
is without information as to the nature
of his orders or the plans of the naval
campaign, and fails to make allowance
for the limitations of conditions.
KAMIMURA OUT OF LUCK.
It is Impossible to obtain complete
facts concerning the Binking of the
Hitashi. She evidently failed to stop
when signaled to do so by a Russian
vessel. The claim la made that Cap
atin Campbell, the English master of
the Hitashi. refused to stop and plan
ned to ram the Russian, but this is de
nied. It is said that the Japanese offi
cers on board the Hitashi declined to
surrender and required Captain Camp
bell to keep his ship going. The asser
tion that the Russians nred upon the
lifeboats in which men were escaping
from the Japanese transport has not
been fully substantiated.
HITASHI REFUSES TO STOP.
The trasports Sado, Hitashi and Id
zumi were the only ones overhauled by
the Russians. Japan had thirteen
transports in and near the strait of
Korea on the morning the Sado and
the Hitashi were caught, and she was
fortunate that only the three ships
mentioned were overtaken by the ene
my.
Whether or not a portion of Vice
Admiral Kamimura's squadron is
awaiting the Russians off Vladivostok
is a carefully guarded secret. Assum
ing that Vice Admiral Kamlmura dis
patched some of his vessels to Vladi
vostok when he learned that the Rus
sian squadron was off Iki Island, these
ships would have had ample time to
arrive there ahead of the Russians
and be ready to give battle. The
weather has been foggy, and this con
dition has been against the Japanese.
It is reported that the raiding Rus
sians captured a British steamship
laden with coal, bound southward from
the Island of Yezo, and sent her to
Vladivostok with a prize crew, but the
report Is not confirmed by .the Japanese
Navy Department.
TOKIO, June 19. â The remarka
ble raid of the Russian Vladivo
stok squadron evidently is oven The
squadron disappeared yesterday off
Cape HenashJ, steering to the north,
and has not been reported since. It
is assumed to be returning to
Vladivostok.
The Japanese steamer Maiko was

16, but escaped to Tsu Island.

NAGASAKI, June 19.â Three boat
loads of survivors of the Japanese
transport Idzumi, which was sunk by
the raiding Russian squadron off
Oshima on the morning of June 15
have arrived at Hakata. Twenty-two
other Burvivors have landed at
Maizuru.
The survivors declare that the
Idzumi was surrounded at 8 o'clock
the morning of the 15th by Russian
ships, and that the people on board
of her were transferred to the Rus
sian armored cruiser Gromoboi, after
which the tra.nsport was shelled and
sunk. The persons removed from the
Japanese ship, numbering 108 all told,
were confined below on board the
Gromoboi. During the afternoon of
the next day, while off Okino Isjand,
twenty-two non-combatants were
transhipped to the Japanese vessel
Unko. The Gromoboi then proceeded
to the north.

A Few Words About a Guarantee llyL
And What* \X> Means In Our Store fs^^plffiii^
The word "guarantee" is used and abused by almost every store in the
land. It is a good word, but it means nothing unless it is backed up. Mere
promise is valueless unless it is followed by performance.
In our store "guarantee" means just what Noah Webster defined it to
5 e âthe act of doing what you say you will do. /H^^mHP^
For instance, in our tailoring department we say to a customer: "If ' ffK^^^^^^^^.
this suit does not please you in every way let us make you another one. Â¦ ' M^^^B^^i^^M
But we will not even put you to. this bother if you would rather have your Â«^p^^|^fi$|i^p
Any customer of our store is entitled to free repairing, sponging and
pressing of his garments from the day he first puts them on until he lays S^SB|^S^f
them aside after having done their full duty. ijlflsk - '^
This is our guarantee and we back it up. || BHÂ»*.S"T&Sf
Let us show you the suits we make to order from $10 to $35. You

The waste from the leak was bo
great that the water pressure was
perceptibly noticeable to residents in
the vicinity. For some time it was
impossible to get water In the second
story of a dwelling because of the
lack of pressure.
It was shortly after 6 o'clock that
the break occurred. Before the re
pair gang arrived thousands of gal
lons of water had poured as if from a
great gushing geyser and had formed
a swiftly running stream the full
width of the 100 feet of roadway
across the dam. The early morning
street cars could barely make their
way through the flood. For a time
there was serious danger that >he
railroad tracks would be washed out.
The water tore along to Kendall's boat
house on the north side of the high
way and washed out a section of the
new fill west of that structure. The
catch basins were entirely inadequate
to carry off the heavy flow, so much
of the wasted water found its way over
the banks into the lake on the one
side and the outlet into the estuary
on the opposite side of the roadway.
As. rapidly as possible the water
company rounded up a repair crew
and the men were dispatched to the
scene of the break. After several
hours' work the rupture in the heavy
wrought iron piping was found and
steps Â«were taken to mend the injury.
Like an ebullient geyser did a
stream of water shoot from the
ground this morning at Twelfth and
Fallon streets and pour with millrace
speed down to the dam, sweeping
hundreds of feet of the top dressing
of macadam into Lake Merritt and the
catch basin outlets. The torrent was
caused by the bursting of the Contra
Costa Water Company's big twenty
four-inch main that crosses on the
south side of Twelfth street dam
from East Oakland.

LIVERMORE, June 19.â Livermore Is
going to have such a Fourth of July as
this valley has never seen before. The
committees at work have more than
J1QO0 already collected, and have ar
ranged a series of capital attractions
for the day.
There will be all the usual features
of parades, orations, literary exercises,
fireworks and noise, and in addition
there will be several events that are
not usually on the programmes of the
nation's birthday celebrations. There
will be horse races, with a series of
athletic contests, for prizes, and chief
among the attractions will be the
"bronco busting" match, with a real girl
"bronco buster."
The committee in charge of the ath
letic events decided to give a substan
tial priae for the best "bronco bust
ing" exhibition. There, are plenty of
untamed horses in the hills back of
Livermore, and there are many cow
boys in the town. The committee, how
ever, wanted some outside talent, and
therefore circulated their offers all
through the San Joaquin Valley. The
result is that entries for this unique
event have been received from as far

H. D. Irwin, the South Berkeley real
estate man. has sold a number of
houses and lots lately in his part of the
town. None of the houses are very ex
pensive, but they are to be occupied by
families who will add much to the tone
and wealth of the place. There is a
marked Improvement in the style of
architecture in South Berkeley, and this
is, drawing people of taste and some
means In that direction. Among the
transactions Irwin has lately nego
tiated are the following sales; Home

BERKELEY, June 19.â Berkeley is
likely to get very soon what it needs
almost more than anything elseâ a hos
pital. Recent accidents. In which there
was no place at hand to receive the
victims, demonstrated that the city is
woefully lacking In hospital facilities.
These accidents have furnished an ob
ject lesson to the townspeople, and the
result is a movement, to establish a
sanitarium. A corporation Is In pro
cess of formation and efforts are mak
ing to acquire the old Hume property,
with its fine mansion, on Dwight way,
so that it may be turned Into a shelter
for sick and Injured persons. The ne
gotiations with Mrs. Bessie Hume, who
owns the property, are being carried
on by W. R. Ellis & Co., the real estate
men. It Is understood that _when the
transaction is completed $2^000 will
change hands. The Hume residence is
well located for such a purpose, and
it is proposed to spend at least $5000
on equipment of the sixteen rooms con
tained within It. N
'HOSPITAL FOR BERKELEY.
The Realty Syndicate, through Its
agents, Wickham Havens, J. H. Spring,
George Sterling and F. C. Havens,
have recently purchased 147 acres of
tide land on the Berkeley shore, just
south of Flemings Point. The deeds
are signed by H. F. and Frederica M.
Teschemacher, Joseph H. and Agnes
H. Howard, E. D. and Julia D. Bey
lard, and Henry P. Bowie. It is believ
ed that thp Realty Syndicate is simply
acting as the agent of some other cor
poration In making this important pur
chase, for, while the frontage forms an
excellent site for a railway terminal,
it is not thought that any of the cor
porations allied to the syndicate have
plans for a terminal at that point.
Holcomb, Breed & Bancroft of Oak
land report a very satisfactory business
for May, with a strong demand for cot
tages, to rent, and especially for fur
nished places. Latham Terrace, which
Is situated on the heights at the head
of Twenty-third avenue, is having a
ready sale, the prices being very low
owing to the closing up of an estate.
Never In the history of this city has
any tract caused so much stir and at
tention as the Santa Fe tract, between
Telegraph avenue and Adeline street
and running north from Forty-seventh
to Fifty-fifth street. Its proximity
to all the car lines and the excellent
service of the Key Route system has
made this particular tract prominent.
There are In course of construction ten
good houses, the owners of, which are
San Francisco business men. This firm
has put in all the street work, gas and
electric service and is beautifying the
streets with palm trees. Twenty lots
have been sold the last ten days.
The executive committee in charge
of the new tourist hotel project will
hold a meeting early next week. The
subscriptions already received will then
be reported. A number of communica
tions have been received by C. H. King,
the chairman, and Edwin Stearns, sec
retary, of the executive committee,
from dealers in granite, stone and other
building materials, in other parts of
the State, offering to furnish material
for the hotel and take stock in pay
ment. This Is proof that the proposal
to erect an up-to-date tourist hotel in
this city is arousing interest outside of
Oakland, and It also proves that busi
ness men believe the new enterprise
will be successful.
The excavating for the new five
story apartment building which is to
be erected on Broadway, just south of
the postofflce, has already begun. This
building will be constructed of brick,
iron and stone, and will be fireproof
throughout. The ground floor will be
used for stores, and the four upper
ones will be divided Into apartments
with three or four rooms in each suite.
TOURIST HOTEL PLANS;
MANY XEW BUILDINGS.
Nearly one^hundred sets of plans for
new buildings were filed with Sanitary
Inspector Stewart F. Gemmel during
the month of May, fifty-eight of these
being for private dwellings, twenty
nine for flats and several for stores.
Plans for one bank and one cannery
were among those filed.
The construction work on the new
Union Savings Bank building, at
Broadway and Thirteenth street, has
practically been completed, and the
decorators are now at work on th?
first floor. The finishers have completed
their work in the Bacon block, and a
number of the offices are already occu
pied. All the stores on the ground
floor have been rented for some time.
Great activity in building operations
and many sales of Oakland property
to people from other parts of the Htate
and from the East have marked the
last month. This influx of outside cap
ital is one of the surest signs of pro
gress in this city. Within the last
quarter nearly twenty new firms have
been organized in Oakland, and seven
of these are already located in the new
Bacon block on Washington street.
During the present month the local
real estate market has been extremely
active. William J. Laymance, of the
Laymance Real Estate Company, says
that fully twenty-five per cent of the
sales of Oakland property made since
the first of June, and in fact during
the past year, have been made to new
comers, who were first attracted to the
Pacific. Coast by climatic conditions,
and after seeing the natural advan
tages offered by this city decided upon
Oakland as an ideal location for busi
ness â¢ and residence.
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,

He declared that his experience leads
him to believe more and more in the
eternal facts of religion, and that his
assurances he gets not from books, but
from people. '
Dr. Rader made passing reference to
his forthcoming journey abroad, and
said that his trip will be taken with
the object of getting new grist for his
mill, and that his visit to London will
be to study men and affairs.
Atheism, he said, has been driven
from the field, both by science and re
ligion.
There are three descriptions of non
churchgoers, said Dr. I Raderâ the
thoughtless, the thoughtful and the in
different The thoughtless are losing
the grift of conviction, the thoughtful
are taking up many things outside the
church and the indifferent assume an
attitude of opposition.
"A Vlfw of the World aa Seen From
a Hun Francisco Pulpit" was the sub
ject of a sermon by the Rev. William
Itartcr at the Third Congregational
Church last evening. The edifice was
crowded with worshipers, and being the
last of Dr. Rader'B sermons prior to
his departure for London on a three
months' vacation there were many of
other denominations present, and after
the service they took occasion to bid
the doctor bon voyage.
Dr. Kader said that this age is better
than any other, and he gave it as his
opinion that people believe in religion
more than in theology â that they love
flowers better than they do botany, the
stars more than astronomy, life more
than dogma and like Christianity more
than they do the church. They believe
in God In some form.

Dr. Flint was born in Maine and came
to California in 1851. becoming a promi
nent factor in the early history of the
State. He was a member of the well
known firm oCÂ» Flint, Blxby & Co.,
which owned large holdings in the cen
tral and southern parts of the State,
besides large tracts of land In Wash
ington and Oregon. Dr. Flint was also

The use of colored inks is almost as
ancient as writing itself, since we find
in the oldest manuscripts black, : :d,
green, violet and yellow inks, usually
applied only as ornaments, except the
old "standbys," black and red; and
consequently we are not surprised that
inkstands with two or more wells were

The eltar was draped^ in black and
the hymns and organ solos were in
cccord with the feelings of the mourn
ing pastor and congregation.
The Rev. J. Fuendeling-, the pastor,
delivered a touching sermon, speak
ing from the text, "Your feasts shall
be turned Into mourning and all your
mirth into lamentation." He spoke of
the sympathy that went out from the
hearts of all Americans to the suf
ferers, to the bereaved and to the
rhurch. and he naid a hiph tribute to
the officers of the New York church,
all of whom, he said, were at their
posts when the awful need came for
their assistance. These officers were
counted among the lost.
A thought that had come to him In
the hour of sorrow was the evidence
of harmony which exists among the
denominations in New York. . Among
the hundreds missing were many of
other denominations than the Lutheran
rhurch.
The Fpeaker said he had instantly

One. body was found floating in the
river rear Rikers Island, while nine

tom aJong the beac-h. running from the
island down to the channel in the river.
Three men working with an im
provised grapple, consisting of a block
of wood to which many fishhooks were
attached, drew up the section of the
rail of the upper deck of the Slocum
about thirty feet in length. The
bodies of four women were clinging to
the rail, the fingers gripping the inter
laced wire roping. This r>art of the
rail gave way just before the steamer
was beached, precipitating 100 persons
into the water. While the rail was be
ing brought to shore two of the bodies
liroke away from it. but were re
covered.
The funerals of nearly a hundred
victims of the disaster were held to
day. In many instances two caskets
v.-ere carried in the same hearse and
in some cases two r.nd even three
hearses bore away the dead of a single
family.
Early this morning the searchers
began anew the work of locatinz the
Siocum's dead. Within an hour they
had recovered thirteen bodies off the
shore of North Brothervlsland. Three
of the bodies were floating, and It is
the general opinion that many more
will come to the surface during the
week. At sundown, when work prac
tically ceased for the day, thirty-six
bodies had been added to the lone list
r>f dead. Most of these bodies were
Identified.
Of the bodies recovered durins the
first hour one was that of a man, six
*vere of women, two of boys, four of
girls and one was an infant.
A life-saver grappling from a raft
brought up a woman of CO and a girl
of 11 years locked in each other's
arms. A few minutes later he brought
up the bodies of a boy 9 years old and
a girl of â¬, apparently brother and
cister, clinging together.
Divers who went to the wreck
found the bodies of a woman, a girl
and a boy and brought them to the
surface. They were burned beyond
recognition. The divers say there are
more bodies in the wreckage, thus
bearing out the statement made a day
or two ago. after it was thought the
wreck had been cleared, that many
bodies remained under the entangle
ment of timbers and iron.
NEW YORK. June 19. â Sunday's
harvest of dead from the steamer
General Slocum numbered forty-nine,
bringing the total number of bodies
bo far recovered ud to 632. Of these
E69 have been identified, while about
thirty of the victims now lying at the
Morgue have not been claimed by
friends or relatives. During the day
thirty-six bodies were recovered, and
It was not until after dark, when the
preat majority of. the searchers had
ceased to work, that the others were
found. Most of these came up from the
bottom and floated in shore. They were
discovered bv the solice who were
left to watch all night.
While the list of missing has been
cut down somewhat by the identifica

were added to that roll, thus leaving
the total of missing almost as it was
on Saturday, something more than

The people of the United States
drink more coffee than any other na
tion on earth, but not as much in pro
portion as the people of certain other
countries. When the difference in pop
ulation is taken into consideration Bra
zil far surpasses us as a country of
coffee drinkers. Belgium and Holland
also excel us in this respect. The con
sumption of coffee per capita in Brazil
is fourteen pounds each year, in Bel

while in the United States each person

of eight pounds of coffee yearly. Eng

It is very fitting: that the native
name for Stanley. "Bula Matarl."
should form part of the Inscription on
his coffin. It means, we believe. "The
Rock Breaker," and expresses the Af

of physical power. To the great ma
jority of the natives with whom he
came in contact Stanley was an en
tirely super-human being, and yet he
was not, physically speaking, a par

him appear of gigantic strength to men

"Ward, if you really care for the
place on the national committee I will
retire in your favor."
Ward said he did not care for It and
the two men went to Governor Odell
and apprised him of the difficulty. Sen
ator Depew was present, and, after
hearing Warren's statement, announc
ed to the Governor that he favored
Ward, who was from ms own district.
It was decided to go to Senator Platt
and announce the decision and then
occurred the first objection. Senator
Platt said that former Chairman "Dunn
should have the place, to compensate
him for the loss of the State chair
manship. Governor Odell objected and
when Senator Platt substituted the
name of former State Senator J. Sloat
Fassett he entered the same objection.
Finally Senator Platt agreed to Ward's
selection.
Governor Odell had two candidates,
William Warren of Buffalo and Wil
liam Ward of Westchester. Senator
Platt was for Sheldon's retention first,
and, when that was refused, was
either for former- State Chairman
George W. Dunn of Binghamton or J.
Sloat Fassett of Elmira. This after
noon Warren of Buffalo met Ward on
the street and said:
CHICAGO, June 19.â Unless some

decision, contemplated for some time
by Governor Odell, was not arrived at
without considerable friction and the
announcement was not received to
night with great cordiality by many of
the delegates. Sheldon, the present
national committeeman, was appointed
by the late Chairman Hanna. Govern

antagonistic attitude assumed toward
him by Sheldon after the latter had

Reparation Is Made to Man
Who Lost Valuable Claim
Through a False Friend
Governor Carter of Hawaii was the
guest of his delegates at a dinner to
night. The repast concluded, he was
introduced to the delegates from Cali
fornia. Then he announced that he
had. been requested, on behalf of the
Hawaiian delegates, to prepare a letter
of thanks to the Californias for the
courtesies extended by them to the
representatives from the islands.
California's delegation was overjoyed
to-day at the weather's salutation.
Early in the afternoon a cool, invigor
ating fog swept in from Lake Michigan.
Chicagoans, with visions of pneumonia,
abandoned the boulevards, but the Cal
iforniansâSan Franciscans in particu
larâhired every available automobile,
and rustled through the gray mist in
gTerft delight. It was nature's -wel

HAWAIIAN'S ARE GRATEFUL.
Henry T. Oxnard. whose ambition to
represent California in the United
States Senate is well known, arrived in
Chicago to-dav. His visit here has no
significance, so far as his own ambi
tions arc concerned, he said. He has
been an enthusiastic attendant at every
Republican national convention for
twenty years and the probability that
the announcement of his presence here
would cause discussion could not deter
him, he added, "from enjoying as a
rpectator the deliberations of the body
that makes Presidents. Oxnard was
greeted by Judge W. C. Van Fleet,
George A. Knight and Judge J. W. Mc-
Kinley, and, after toasting their health,
renewed acquaintances of departed
years.
A. Ruef v of San Francisco was anx
ious to be numbered among those that
v ill supply the timber for the platform,
but Short's supporters seem to be in
the majority. Ruef has not announced
his intention to withdraw in favor of
Bhort, and it is probable that the ques
tion will be forced to a vote when th<Â»
delegation meets to-morrow.
Short, it is .=aid by the leaders of the
delegation, will win. Ruef makes no
claims. That Ruef will be . given an
equally important position, however, is
admitted. His activity has impressed
the delegation and his ambition is ad
mired.
Frank H. Short o( Fresno will rep
resent California on the committee on
platform and resolutions.
Later Gunst informed Judge Me-
Kinley. chairman of the California
delegation, that he would step out in
the interests of harmony and Governor
Pardee. Chairman McKinley informed
the delegates of the situation. The
delegation will respect the Governor's
wishes.
RUEF AND SHORT CLASH.
This fact soon reached Gunst's ears.
Immeasurably disappointed, Gunst
sought the Governor for an interview.
When the Governor informed him that
it was true they were both seeking the
same honor, Gunst announced that he
would not permit his name to go be
fore the delegation as a candidate for
the office.
Finally, howeVer, it was circulated
that to add the spice of uncertainty to
Gunst's aspirations Governor Pardee
had caused it to be made known that
he sought the honor Gunst believed
was already in his hand.
It was contended later that it was
the Governor's desire to indulge in his
leaning toward practical jokes that
caused him to express his willingness
to represent California on the noti
fication committee. This announce
ment brightened Gunst's political hori
zon immeasurably, but darkness was
again to come. Whether or not it was
this incident on the train that awaken
ed the Governor's desire to become a
member of the notification commit
tee probably will never be known, but
the fact remains that to-day Governor
Pardee not only expressed his desire
to become a member of the committee,
but requested several of the delegates
to support him If the question came to
a contest.
When the California delegation left
the Oakland pier on its special train
Gunst was nursing a well-developed
ambition to represent California on the
notification committee. A careful inves
tigation of the strength of his candi
dacy failed to develop the slightest
trace of opposition. Those that did not
openly espouse his cause remained si
lent, and this Gunst's supporters inter
preted as meaning consent.
PARDEE WAS NOT JOKING.
HEADQUARTERS CALIFORNIA
DELEGATION, CHICAGO. June 19.â
Through the consideration of M. A.
Gunst of San Francisco what threat
ened to be an unpleasant contest in the
California delegation to the Republican
National Convention for the honor of
representing the Golden Sate on the
committee that will notify President
Roosevelt of his nomination for the of
fice he now occupies was avoided. At
a late hour to-night Gunst announced
that he would bury his aspirations that
those of Governor Pardee might flour
ish and bear fruit.
"I have not a word to say about the
platform," said the Massachusetts
Senator, as he dived to the bottom of
the most capacious, valise that ever
came to Chicago. "I can't say a word."
he repeated, as he put things to rights
In his rooms at the" Auditorium, "not
even on the interesting topic of reci
procity, nor in reply to your question
as to .whether we shall 'stand pat.' I
am simply dumb for the time."
There is some sentiment favorable to
a, declaration looking to revision, but
the "stand patters" are holding their
position with a tenacity that indicates
a determination to oppose such a
movement. Senator Kean of New Jer
sey is a good example of this class.
"I see no reason for a change in our
present policy," said the Senator, "and
I am opposed to a move in that direc
tion.' My. opinion is that we should let
conditions alone."
"Wilpthere be a pronouncement on
reciprocity?" he was asked, but in
Senator Allison said to-night that the
Iowa delegation had not as yet dis
cussed the question of the Vice Presi
dency, but that it would hold a meet
ing to-morrow to decide what action
to take. He would not state his own
choice. Senator Kean of New Jersey,
however, was outspoken in his sup
port of Fairbanks.
The delegates apparently are giving
comparatively little attention to the
platform. The prevailing opinion is
that the wishes "of the President should
be largely consulted on that point and
the impression goes to the extent of
believing he has indicated his views
to his particular friends. That Sena
tor Lodge has drawn up the principal
resolutions of the platform is gener
ally conceded, and all doubt as to
whether he would be chairman of the
committee on resolutions has been dis
pelled by the notification which Acting
Chairman Payne has given the Sena
tor that he will be recognized to make
the motion for the appointment of the
platform committee.
Through an envoy of several North
western delegations who called on the
President several days ago and in
their behalf expressed a wfsh to sup
port the man he preferred, the Presi
dent has sent word that while he ap
preciates the compliment, he will
leave this entirely to the convention.
Senator McCumber of North Dakota
has come out for Fairbanks and thinks
that sentiment in the Northwest is
crystallizing on the Indiana man. An
effort is being made by Senator Fair
banks* more enthusiastic supporters to
have an Alabama delegate nominate
him.
Several personal representatives of
the President, who arrived to-day,
made an emphatic declaration that the
President was positive in his determi
nation to express no preference re
garding the selection of his running
mate. Both Senator Lodge and. Secre
tary Root said this to all the delegates
who approached them on the subject.
Speaking for themselves, the close
friends of the President say they do
not doubt that Fairbanks would be ac
ceptable to Mr. Roosevelt, but they are
not willing that the President's name
should be dragged In to assist the In
diana Senator's nomination.
Another meeting of the Illinois flele
gation is scheduled for to-morrow,
when the chairmanship question will
be settled. Both Senator Cullom and
Governor Yates are aspirants for this
honor.
PRESIDENT HOLDS ALOOF.
With one exception, the New Hamp
shire delegation is for Fairbanks. Sen
ator, Burnham expressed confidence in
the ability of the remaining members
to bring over the anti-Fairbanks dele
gate. *
The Massachusetts delegation arrived
with an idea that Tlitt would be the
candidate, but after the. delegates had
been here a few hours they decided to
wait- until to-morrow before announc
ing a preference. Several delegates
said that the Illinois people seemed to
have got to work rather slowly and
that it would be wiser for Massachu
setts to withhold action.
The present position of the New York
delegation with respect to the Vice-
Presidency was stated to-night by Sen
ator Depew. At first, he said the dele
gates thought it would be a pictur
esque thing to nominate Cannon, but
inasmuch as the Speaker would not
have It and Senator Fairbanks would,
they would declare, he said, for Fair
banks.
NEW YORK'S ATTITUDE.
Senator Cullom of Illinois said:
"There are many delegates in Illinois,
and in other States also, who do not
favor the attitude taken by Senator
Fairbanks and prefer that the place
should go to a man who will show a
little more appreciation of it. Illinois
has a good man in Hitt, and rather
than let the thing slide to Senator
Fairbanks in an aimless sort of way
we have decided to push the fight for
Hitt as strongly as possible."
The continued silence of Senator
Fairbanks as to his pleasure regarding
the Vice Presidential nomination was
the base of the vigorous movement
toward Representative Hitt. The
opinion was strongly expressed at the
gathering of the/ Illinois delegation
that at least until Senator Fairbanks
announced himself there was no rea
son why an active campaign for Hitt
should not progress. Each delegate
was commanded to go forth and hustle
for Hitt. Graeme Stewart, the Illinois
member of the national committee,
was nominally put in charge of these
endeavors. While the work of the
day has not been compiled into a
single report, each worker heard from
has encouraging news for the Hitt
boom. .
Delegates generally express the view
that Senator Fairbanks should indicate
his desires one way or the other. In
the absence of this indication and with
positive assurance that Illinois Is seri
ous in the Hitt candidacy, many State
delegates seem willing to march un
der the Hitt banner. "

Senator Beveridge, Governor Dur

Representative Watson and most of
the Indiana delegates arrived to-day.
The delegation will meet to-morrow
morning. Senator Beveridge probably
will be elected chairman of the dele
gation.
On every train delegates arrived to
day and to-night the hotel corridors
are taking on a convention aspect.
Quite the most picturesque entry into
the city was that of the Alaskan dele
gation, a half-dozen strong, each man
carrying a miniature totem pole, on
which was mounted a big white-necked
Alaskan eagle.
The Iowa delegation has determined
upon J. W. Blythe of Burlington as the
representative of the Hawkeye State
on the Resolutions Committee. The se
lection of Blythe, who is the counsel
for the Burlington Railroad, is opposed
to the Governor Cummins faction and
prohibits absolutely the introduction
by the Iowa delegation of a plank sup
porting either tariff amendment or a
reciprocity agreement. It puts the
Hawkeye delegation with the rank of
the "stand patters."
As originally drafted, the plank waa
longer than this, but the Senator de
clared to-night that he would present
it in the form quoted.
The National Manufacturers' Asso
ciation is planning to make a strong
fight against the insertion in the plat
form of any plank calling for or de
claring in favor of the adoption of an
eight-hour day or any declaration
against the writ of injunction as ap
plied to labor disputes. Eighteen
members of the association, several of
whom belong to the etecujive com
mittee, are expected to arrive to-mor
row morning to watch the interests
of the association.
"We recommend an early readjust
ment of thÂ« rates of duty in existing
tariff schedules to meet the require

ness conditions and in the matter of
our commercial relations with other
countries."
Senator Hansbrough's plank in the
form in which he will present it to the
committee reads as follows:
HAXSBROUGH FOR REVISION*.
Senator Hansbrough of North Da
kota, on the other hand, is leading a
fight for tariff changes. He is the
author of a declaration, which he cir
culated freely to-day, calling for "such
a modification in the tariff as will meet
our changed and changing conditions."
Delegates from the trans- Missouri
section are generally opposed to any
declaration for reciprocity, because of
the effect of the statutory adoption of
such a policy on fruits, wines, wool
and hides.

POSTUM CEKE/VT,.
HAS TRIED BOTH. j
Travel for Health* vs. Dieting.
A man who was sent to Europe for
his health and finally found cure in a
little change in his diet says:
"I was troubled with dyspepsia for
five years, and two doctors here in Ke-
nosha that treated me for over a year
both told me there was no help for me.
Then I had an expert from Chicago, but
still received no relief. Then followed
another expert from Chicago, who came
to our house two times a month for
four months. He gave me up like all
the others and told mo to take a trip
across the ocean, which I did in the
year 1899, and came home about as bad
as when I started. The doctors told me
my stomach lining was full of sores.
Then I began to study my own case
and learned of the diet recommended by
the Postum Cereal Co., so I gave up
coffee, pork and all greasy foods and
began using Postum Food Coffee. Grad-
ually I got better and better, until I am
well now as I ever was in my younger
days, have no trouble and eat anything
fit to eat.
"Sometimes away from home I am
persuaded to drink coffee, but I only
take a sip of it, for it tastes bitter and
disagreeable to me, but the longer I use
Postum the better I like it and the bet-
ter I feel. I could say a great deal more
of my experience with Postum, but
think this will give every one a good
idea of what leaving off coffee and
using Postum can do." Name given by

Those picturesque weapons â the bay

bulk and glitter, figure more largely in
war new?, no doubt, than they do in
the casualties of the Russians and the
Japanese. Cold figures have long dif
fered radically from word pictures and
battle paintings as to the damage done
by "cold steel" under the conditions of
modern war. The Army and Navy
Journal has published data bearing
upon this question which is at especial
interest while the struggle between
Russia and Japan is still young and its
chances are the subject of universal
speculation. It is shown that in the
Civil War out of 240,712 wounds treated
by the surgeons of the Union army only
922, or about four-tenths of one per
cent, were caused by bayonets and
cabers. Who could have guessed any
thing like that very small proportion
from the literature of the war period?
In the Crimean war, where the Russian
tendency to get to close quarters was
encouraged by the conditions of the con
flict, the saber and the bayonet were
more active, causing 2*Â£ per cent of the
wounds received by the British and
French soldiers. But in the Franco-
German war of 1870-71 the bayonet and
the saber together could claim less than
one-third of on- per cent of the casual
ties suffered by the German armies. It
is the bullet and the shell, especially
the -rifle projectile, no thicker than a
lead pencil, neither picturesque like the
saber nor imposing like the masses of
Bteel and iron hurled but of great guns,
which has always in modern times done
the really destructive work of war. So,
undoubtedly, it is the rifle which is the
chief weapon of the conflict' between
Russia and Japaa.â Cleveland Leader.
Weapons That Kill.
Major Seely, D. S. O., tells a pathetic
story of a little Boer lad who pre
ferred to die rather than give any in
formation likely to result in the cap
ture of his fellow countrymen. On one
occasion during the war, Major Seely
said, he was instructed to get some
volunteers and tryâ to capture a com
mandant at a farmhouse some twenty
miles away. He got the men ready
and they set out. It was a rather des
perate enterprise, but they got to the
farmhouse all right, only to find, how
ever, that the elusive Boer had cleared
out in an unknown direction. It was
vitally important that the British force
should get some information, for it
became a question perhaps of the
Boers capturing them and not they
catching the Boer commandant. At
the farmhouse they saw a good look
ing Boer boy and some yeomen. Major
Seely asked the boy if the command
ant had been there, and he said in
Dutch, taken by surprise, "Yes."
"Where has he gone?" was the nert
question, and the boy became sus
picious and answered, "I don't know."
"I decided then," continued Major
Seely, "to do a thing for which I hope
I may be forgiven, because my men's
lives were in danger. I threatened the
boy with death If he would not dis
close the whereabouts of the general.
He still refused, and I put him against
a wall and said I would have him shot.
At the same time I whispered to my
men, 'For heaven's sake, don't shoot.'
The boy still refused, although I oould
see he believed I was going to have
him' shot." I ordered the men to
'present.' Every rifle was leveled at
the boy;. 'Now, 1 I said, 'before I give
the word, which way has the general

At last accounts there were under
stood to be several writs out for the
Marquis, whose endless extravagances
are said to have been responsible for
his disastrous finish. Even an income
of 51,000.000 a year, which the noble'
man was said to possess, could not
stand Christmas trees with their
branches encrusted with small dia
monds and hung with larger ones,
such as the Marquis provided for his
guests at Anglesey last yuletide. The
magnificent motor car which he
bought some time ago and whicl. was
said to be the most sumptuous on
earth, has not yet been paid for.
The Marquis' attempt to square
himself, as it were, with Providence
was made in this wise. It will be re
membered, no doubt, that when first
his Lordship conceived the idea of
giving Christmas pantomimes at
Anglesey Castle he committed the pro
fane act of turning the private chapel
there into a pocket theater, .which he
named the Gaiety. Naturally this
shocked the clergyman as well as all
other devout folk "in the neighborhood
and frequent appeals were made to
the peer to restore the place to its
original state. To these, however, he
turned a deaf ear and the "butterfly"
and skirt dances which the Marquis
delighted in executing went on where
once his ancestors fiad offered up
their prayers. But not long ago â or
just when times began to get hard
with the lavish-handed nobleman â a
more "determined divine called at the
castle, who declared to the Marquis
that his troubles would Increase and
multiply if he did not instantly repair
his desecration of God's house. And
the Btory goes that the peer, made ap
prehensive perhaps by what already
had befallen him, promised obedience,
and ordered the chapel changed back
forthwith.

Â«-r-*HE United States Census has just given
I out a preliminary report of the progress of irriga
Â¦*â¢â¢ tion in this country during the year 1902. That
question is of more thap usual interest to people of
the West just now, owing to the recent appropriation by
the General Government of the sum of twenty-seven mil
lions of dollars for irrigation in their territory. The re
"The acreage reported as irrigated in 1902 exceeds
that of 1899 by 1.704,889, acres, the length of canals and
-ditches by 14,361 miles, the cost of irrigation systems
by $21,797,672 and the number of irrigated farms by
23480." That showing is gratifying when it is remem
bered that in many parts of the United States it was
made under discouraging conditions. The crop year of
1902 in the arid portion of the West was a poor one
owing to the snowfall in the mountains being unusually
ligtit, materially reducing the flow in the irrigating
ditches.
As an evidence of the growing interest in Western
territory being shown by home seekers, the report states
that: "In the last , twenty years there has been a great
awakening to the opportunities which lie in the arid
West for the home maker, and a remarkable transforma
tion has taken place in many parts, of this region. The
irrigation of to-day, through lessons of experience and
observation of the results obtained by the pioneers, evinces
a more ready adaptability to conditions. Great problems
of water storage and diversion, involving features never
before considered, are being worked out to practical
solution."
One of the features auxiliary to irrigation, the value
of which is coming to be better understood and ap
preciated, is the possibility of utilizing the force of the
water as a motive power and for the development of elec
tricity. Under that head it is stated: "The great dams
which impound the floods once wasted furnish abundant
electric power for all purposes. Every available stream
is now a potent factor for good. The flow of the canals
turns wheels which lift large quantities of water to fields
above the line of gravity supply."
The mining industry has profited very largely by the
inauguration of irrigation systems. Where water has
been brought upon the land intended primarily for pur
poses of agriculture, it has in many instances been used
also to develop mines, which otherwise could not have
been worked successfully.
As to the number of farms irrigated, California is
given first rank, with Utah second and Colorado third,
while in the matter of total irrigated area Colorado
stands first, California second and Montana third. The
aggregate mileage, of main canals and ditches in this
country in the year 1902 is reported as being more than
enough to encircle the earth twice, their combined length
being 59,243 miles.
GROWTH OF IRRIGATION.
When the first Queen cf the Belgians
lay dying she expressed a wish to her
eldest son, Leopold, that when he suc
ceeded to the throne he should never
sign hlÂ» name to a death warrant or
give his consent to the execution of a
capital sentence. Leopold was only 15
years of age at the time. He was about
20 when he became King and he is near
TO to-day. But though regarded as in
capable of any lasting affection and
credited with an amount of cynicism
unrivaled in the annals of Old World
royalty, be has always remembered his
mother's request and has so invariably
refrained from sanctioning the execu
tion of death sentences that Belgium is
to-day classed as one of the countries
where capital punishment has been
abolished. Yet the death penalty re
mains on the Belgian statute book,
though few people outside the kingdom
are aware of the fact, and in every
case where criminals are convicted of
murder without extenuating circum
stances the Judges solemnly pass the
sentence of death, which, owing to the
refusal of the King to sign the death
warrant, is ipse facto commuted to im
prisonment for life. There is a great
difference between life imprisonment of
this kind taking the place of capital
punishment and the penal servitude for
life resulting from a sentencÂ»>thereto
by the Judges. The criminal condemned
to be executed Is regarded as dead in
the eyes of the law from the moment
that the sentence of death is passed on
him. The scaffold for his execution is
actually erected: the executioner-at
tends with his assistants to carry out
the sentence of the law. The guillotine
and the victim only axe wanting. In
their place the executioner carries a
great sheet of paper bearing the full
name and the sentence of the criminal,
and this he nails up on a post and
leaves in public sight, that obloquy may
fall on the offender's name.â La Mar

Clatsop County. There was a Justice
of the Peace to be chosen for John

A few days before election George
E. Jackson, the Oakland attorney, who
was visiting Hume, cetermined to
thrust his host Into politics. Unknown
to Hume, Jackson quietly circulated
among the men and by rigorous cam

Hume desired to be chosen to the Jus

This statement seems to hit the situation exactly.
The public has recovered from its fever land is going
slowly, perhaps too slowly. There is such k thing as too
much caution. Conservatism carried to an extreme be
comes fear, which is a great deterrent to trade. There
is nothing in the condition of business in the United
States to-day to justify anybody in getting alarmed or
withdrawing his funds from legitimate channels of in
vestment. Standard stocks in Wall street are down to
a point where they are as safe as investments as they
ever get, for there is nothing absolutely safe in this life,
and even low values often go still lower for a time. But
with money in large supply everywhere, with no fail
ures heavy enough to cause alarm, with crop prospects,
which, to say the least, sre excellent, with a great foreign
trade and a first-rate demand for staple merchandise all
over the United States, the commercial conditions of the
country may be considered as sound as it is possible for
them to get. Quotations for some lines of goods may
go lower still, and some ought to go lower to get where
they belong, but any marked decline now will almost
surely be followed by an upward reaction later on.
This is the view taken by the ablest financiers of the
country, and they ought to know. Hence their surprise
that the public do not take advantage of the present
reasonable prices to invest in the standard securities
which are paying their 3, 4 an J 5 per cent dividends
right along. Indeed, there have been indications of
late that such an investment movement is now on the
eve of starting. Take the New York stock market, for
instance. What appeared to be the beginning of an up
ward movement was under way last week when the
Southern Pacific Company, without a word of warn
ing, launched a huge bugaboo on the market, as a
malicious boy frightens tHe baby with the precipitate
apparition of a hairy and ferocious jack-in-the box, and
the upward movement got a shock that took its breath
away, and it came to an abrupt halt.
This was the announcement that $100,000,000 in pre
ferred stock was to be issued, that it would pay a 7 per
cent dividend and that $40,000,000 of this would be issued
immediately. As this would put a stop to any contem
plated dividends on the common stock, the announce
ment fell like a wet blanket on the market and for the
time being paralyzed if. An . immediate recession all
along the line of stocks took place. London thought it
over a day or so, came to the conclusion that it did not
like it, and began to sell the two Pacifies, Union and
Southern. New York took up the cue and the bull move
ment in stocks was nipped in the very bud, for some
days, at least.
But general business was not appreciably affected by
this setback in Wall street. As mentioned in this column
last week, the condition of. the crops is the controlling
factor in the trade situation this year, and what the
Southern Pacific does with its stock has no effect on the
growth of the wheat and corn in the fields. They grow
right along just the same and are doing so well that the
banks, railroads and large exporters of farm products
are looking forward to a very fair fall trade in conse
quence, in spite of the usual deterrent influence of the
coming Presidential election, which seems to have been
pretty well discounted and is not causing much talk this
year. Nobody expects any abnormal activity during the
rest of 1904, but the condition of the crops and the gen
eral status of the industries almost guarantee a fair
average movement of merchandise and farm products.
Stocks of many lines of goods are now even with the
consumption, but there is no serious accumulation re
ported in any line, and while steel and iron, textile and
Hour mills are closing down every few days all over the
I country, it will be observed that they always start up
again in a few days, and thus far there have not been
any prolonged shot-downs in any important manufactur
ing districts. Wages of operatives "have been reduced
at a number of centers, but the reductions have not been
severe, and as a rule have been accepted by the men
without much murmur, as it is realized that the manu
facturer and the railroad shareholder are taking their
medicine, too. in the form. of decreased dividends.
The staples show little change. Provisions have been
From one end of the country to the other we now
hear that business is quiet, that we have entered upon a
period of recession, that conservatism' is the present
number on the programme and that it is imperative that
every well-ordered citizen go slowly and make no
mercantile mistakes. It is the fashion of the day, like
the Panama hat, and every man says that business is
(;uiet, whether he finds it so or not. This is but another
illustration of the old aphorism that men are sheep; that
they herd together and follow each other and bleat the
As a matter of fact, business, while quiet and possibly
getting quieter, is not really dull, taking the country as
a whole. It is the contrast with the remarkable activity
of the past five or six years that makes it appear so.
The great boom is over, conditions are settling to a more
tranquil and normal plane, fewer new enterprises arc
being floated, and profits are smaller, while production,
:.fter a wild chase to catch up with the consumption, ex
tending over a period of j-ears, has at last overtaken it.
It has been a stern chase, which, sailors tell us, is always
a long one.
A keen-eyed New York banker, evidently well posted
on the current situation, says in a late issue of the Wall
Street Journal: '"Theje is a very healthy demand for
well secured bonds of municipalities, railways and cor
porations, which are offered at attractive prices. In
vestors are very discriminating in their purchases. They
insist on buying only recurities of undoubted merit, and
will only buy these when offered at attractive prices.
The caution on the part of investors is a natural reaction^
from the speculative excesses of a little time ago. In->
vectors are probably a little too cautious now, but it i3
better that they should be in this frame of mind than
not cautious enough. Investors will not touch speculative
securities of doubtful stability. * The bond market bene
fits thereby. Funds that formerly were put into specu
lative stocks are now going into high-grade securities.
Ik traveling through the Middle West I noted signs of
business contraction, but I saw nothing that should give
cause for alarm. Conditions at the bottom are Very
sound."
IT is carious to observe the effect of public sentiment
on current business conditions. It is as strongly
marked as it is upon politics. Several years ago it
was considered every man's dut\- to 'proclaim, through
a megaphone, if necessary, the extraordinary activity of
trade and the wonderful richness and prosperity of the
country; to-day the feeling is equally pronounced that
it is every mans duty to mumble the funereal word
"conservatism" every little while as the surly parrot on
his perch croaks 'pretty polly" at regular intervals, or
the devout Mussulman mutters bis prayer.

doing somewhat better of late, as the packers at the
Western centers arc showing more disposition to sup
port the market. Wool has been moving off briskly
and a fortnight or so ago prices for the raw wool ad
vanced ic per pound all around. Wheat, corn and cot
ton have sought lower 'values, but the declines have not
been violent. The iron- and steel situation remains as
for some weeks past, business being quirt, while quota
tions do not show much change from day to day. Lum
ber is reported dull in the. Eastern and Western slopes
of the country, but fairly active in the Northwest. The
bank clearings are running along about the same, last
week's figures showing a loss of 15.6 per cent from last
3ear, with aggregate' clearings of $1,863,000,000, which
are below the normal. The failures for the week were
257, against 213 last year. The railway earnings thus
far received show a loss of 7.1 per cent in May, which
is an unfavorable exhibit, as the decrease for the two or
three months preceding May had been only about 3 or 5
per cent ns a rule. This decrease in railway earnings
shows the current contraction in business.

An Oakland Judge has demonstrated to a suffering and

be respected. He has decreed that bicyclists must not
usurp the walks provided for pedestrians, but must take
their chances on the broader thoroughfares given to the
traffic of teams. This involves an injustice to that
worthy servant of man. the horse, but it insures a ma

Interesting Experiment** to Determine
Value of IrrUratlnc Grain Fields.
The Modesto News gives an Interest
ing account of experiments in the line
of irrigating grain lands in Stanislaus
County. The News says in part:
Am preliminary to similar experiments to be
made in this section next year and as part of
the irrigation studies now being carriÂ«d on in
Modesto and Turlock irrigation districts In co
operation with the State University and the
State Board of Examiners, Frank Adams, ir
rigation assistant in tile offlce of experiment
stations of the United States Department of
Agriculture, recently irrigated two acres of
barley tbrec mllea eaet of Ceres, on the farm
of C. N. Whitnjore. to determine something of
the feasibility of irrigating grain in th* Mo
desto and Turlock districts. To-day a repre
sentative of the Newa saw several stools of the
irrigated grain and several stools from the
same field that were not Irrigated. The con
trast was strikingly In favor of the Irrigated
crop and decidedly encouraging to thceo wbo
believe Irrigation of grain will pay here as it
do's elsewhere. The irrigated lands were fully
a third better than those from the non-irri
gated stools and showed no signs whatever
of rhrinking. while the stems and leaves were
still grten and growing.
The non-irrigated product, on the other
band, had ceased growing, both heads and
steins being dry and in a state of rapid shrink
age from the dry winds of the past week. The
grain was irrigated by flooding the surface

lation of Â«6Â«3 for Santa Barbara â u very satis
factory Increase over the population as shown

manently established, and the acquisition of
many wealthy families having no children of
school age. It Is palpable that the ratio In the
caÂ«e of this city should be at least C to 1 and
that Santa Barbara, therefore, has a population
of more than 10.700.

take advantage of all the prosperity
that comes or that can be invited by
combined effort and persistent and
carefully planned w r ork, nor is any lo

of this representative body. Lying
6<..me miles from the bay of San Fran

the town now has an expectation of
possible manufacturing plants, which

ether communities about the bay of
San Francisco. Only recently the first

in Fruitvale has joined the board and
X'rofessional men and every class of
citizens are now represented on its

At the first meeting E. H. Marwedel,
George J. Haus, George E. Lund and
Frank Lynch were appointed a com
mittee on constitution and by-laws. To
this committee is confided the task of
framing the rules and laws of the or
ganization. The purpose of the or
panization, however, was amply and
concisely expressed in the document
circulated for the signatures of citi
zens when the proposition to have a
board of trade was new. W. E. Ru-
Ctli and De Loss Pratt were the orig
inal movers. They were seconded at
once by M. L. Du Moutier, to whom is
given the credit of drafting the agree
ment upon which the Board of Trade
organization was based.
Yesterday the sentlemen visited Iron Can
yon, and although they did not have the time
to make anything like a systematic study or
thÂ» place they wore much Interested in the
prospectH which may develoa later.
To-morrow thesÂ«e gentlemen, together with
Prnfrwor Adams and 'Harvey C. StlUa. will
Journey un Llttlt- Chlco to Inspect a reported
reservoir site In the canyon. It Is hoped that
this trip will remit In Interesting the Govern
ment in that locality for h reservoir.
After a carrful study of' the relative condi
tions of Northern and Southern California. Mr.
Lawson exfTPersed much surprise and disap
pointment that this end of the State has so
few reservoir sites, while Southern California
has an abundance of sites, but the scarcity of
water makes them of little avail. This local
ity ha* an abundance of water, but lacks the
necssary sites for the reservoirs. There Is
much hope, however, from what has recently
been reported. Miat some splendid sites will be
found which will answfr every requirement.
tlie creeks which will receive the Immediate
attention of the scientists are Hlir Chlco. Little
chlco. Butte. Ory Creek and IVer Crfek. These
men have come with a four-hores riK and are.
prepared to maka every lnvestleatlon which
will outline a work which may be taken up in
detail by representatives of this department
who will com* later.
L. M. Lawson and J. G. Atklnnon. repre
senting the United States Geological Survey,
are making: Chlco their base of operations
while an extend! <1 examination Is made of the
creeks which run down from the western
slope of the SlTra Mountains to the Sacra
mento River. These <rÂ«ntlemen are working
under the Department of the Interior, in what
Is known as the reclamation service, and their
Eppcial mlr-Fion Is to look for reservoir site*,
on thÂ» creeks, and to chart and estimate In
regard to the Impoundlntr of the many living
streams.
The Chlco Enterprise tells of the ex
plorations of the United States Geo
logical Survey for reservoir sites for
the storage of water In Northern Cali
fornia. The story In part is as follows:

PUBLIC-SPIRITED business men and other citizens of Frultvale,
in Alameda County, have now placed the now Board of Trade
ui>on a permanent footing. This organization has for its pur
pose the advancement of the interests of Frultvnle. It now has
one hundred members. On all possible occasions, at Ijoine and
abroad, the advantaceÂ«Â» of llvinjr in Frnitvnlc will be made known.
The reasonable hope is entertained that the progress o r tlic town
may be as rapid as that of any other community on the east shore of
the bay of San Francisco. Among: the facts that warrant this hope
are admirable locution, with fertile soil, a mild climate and deep
water frontage on the tidal canal.

(You to be full Judge.)
I do hereby solemnly agree and guarantee
to make no charge if I fail to tell your name,
occupation and what you called for: I tell
you If husband, wife or lover Is true or false,
whom and when you will marry, how to gain
the love of the one you desire; in fact, I will
tell you every hope, ftar or ambition better
than you can tell yourself; his advice is re-
liable, his powers are wonderful and Indis-
putable: he Improves your character eo that
you will reach the highest possible develop-
ment In mental and bodily vigor, health,
happiness and capacity to earn wealth: the
controlling power Implanted In your nature,
so you can control any one secretly: gives

For a reliable and Intelligent clairvoyant
reading go to LIVINGSTONE. 428 Eddy st.
He asks you no questions, but tells you
what you wish to know.
H<? does not mention all the Ills and mis-
fortunes you are heir to. You are acquainted
with the facts In your case. Let PROFESSOR
LIVINGSTONE analyze the matters that are
troubling you, find the cause of trouble and
suircest the remedy.
He Is as conspicuous for his wonderful oc-
cult analysis as he Is for his original ex-
pression and vivid truthfulness.
Would It not be a relief to know how you
will Rucceed. to he relieved of the matters that
are troubling you and of the schemes of your
enemies, that you may meet with better success?
A test reading Is not a life reading. When
you call on PROF. LIVINGSTONE he will
give you a full life reading for $1. A test
Is of little value; when the mind is troubled
you need more substantial a!d and advice.

ThÂ»re was no news of the Holliswood yes
terday. The distressed vessel, so far as any
one here knows, is still drifting at thÂ« mercy
of the elements. Leaking, with her sails gone,
with only a meager supply of provisions, she
in indeed Is a sorry plight. Hind. Rolph &. Co.
have ordered thp tug Sea Rover to scour the
waters in the locality In which the transport
rejwrted her to tÂ«e. As soon aa the tug dis
covert* her bhc will take her In tow and bring
her into port. The' Holliswood has been out
114 days. The average trip runs from sixty
to 100 days. Why Captain Knight should
bave run short of provisions seems to be a
)ur?tion that no one on the water front can
answer.
No News of Holliswood.

people had come from far and near to
assist at the service, large parties going
from San Francisco, San Jose and Hol

chanted the mass in the vestibule of the
old sanctuary.
Father Englehardt was assisted by
Father Garriga, the pastor of King
City. In all the country no more ap
pealing sermon on this lovely Sabbath
day was heard than that of the Fran
ciscan, who standing within sight of
the graves of the padres told In stir
ring words of the work of Â£hose sainted
men for the cause of civilization, and
for their God.
BY LAURA BRIDE POWERS.
The Helene had Just arrived from Honolulu
and was anchored off Melggs wharf.
went out to meet her on one of Crowiey's
launches and, jumping from the launch, he
Â¦was in thÂ» art of climbing nimbly up the side
of the schooner when ehe took a lurch and
Fowler was pitched headforemost Into the hay.
Â¦There was a stiff breeze blowing and a choppy
sea running. James Sennett. known along- the
water front as "Deep Sea Jimmy." happened
to lie on the launch at the time and jumped
over the side of the boat and as Fowler came
to the surface Jimmy grabbed him by the
liair and pulled Kim on deck. This iÂ» not
the first time that "Jimmy"' has b*en a life
saver. .
"vVestley Fowler of the Marina Transfer Com
pany fell overboard into the bay yesterday
afternoon as he was trying to board the
eehooner Helene. Ho Buffered nothing: more
than a cold sea bath.
Fell Into the Bay.
On May 6 he spoke the American
ship Astral in latitude 4 degrees 10
minutes south, longitude 154 degrees
west, bound from Honolulu to New
York. The St. David made the trip In
eighty-nine days. She brings 2180 tons
of coal.
Captain Grant reports that on March
22 he encountered strong northeast
gales for thirty-six hours off Lord
Howe Island. He saw nothing of the
Holliswood, which left Newcastle three
weeks before he did.
The American 6hip St. David came
within an ace of going ashore on Mile
Rock on Saturday night. The vessel
was bound in from Newcastle, Aus
tralia. She arrived off the bar about
11:30 p. m. and was suddenly struck by
a strong current which was rapidly
bearing her down on Mile Rock. Cap
tain Grant let go his anchors, which,
fortunately for all concerned, held fast.
As morning broke the captain saw that
they were only about 500 feet away
from the rook and that his position
was perilous. If the weather had been
rough impending destruction would
have stared him in the face. About 4
o'clock yesterday morning a favoring
gale came his way and. weighing an
chor, he sailed into port.
The resolution adopted asks that "a
full, complete and impartial investiga
tion be made into the causes that have
provoked crime and that all guilty of
crime, no matter who or what they be,
be punished in accordance with their
guilt."

NEW YORK, June 19.â For the first
time in the history of Manhattan
Beach, Sunday cycling competitions
were held to-day. Marcus Hurley of
the Xew York Athletic Club and Bur
ton Downing of San Jose divided the
honors in the amateurÂ«events. In the
mile handicap trial heat Hurley, who is
the amateur champion, rode from
scratch, and took the lead in the final
lap. He held his advantage until
within a few yards of the finish when
Downing passed him, winning by half
a wheel. Both cyclists rode from
scratch. Hurley eventually obtained
first prize by three parts of a length.
Downing swerved badly in the final
hundred yards and this may have cost
him the race.

E. Janikie, the Fresno leashman,
swept the field with his dogs in the
ppen stake yesterday at Ingleside
Coursing Park. Eagle Bird beat his
kennel mate. General Fremont, in the
deciding course. In this course Eagle
Bird was luckv to win, as in the run
up the hare swerved to Eagle Bird,
which undoubtedly gave him the flag.
Janikie's Golden Feather received
third money.
In the puppy stake J. M. Carroll's
Bright Columbia ran over her op
ponents and easily annexed first hon
ors. In the final she beat Croix D
in a course which gave the youngsters
a severe test. The consolation stake
was won by Fortuna Angel. The
talent had easily the best of the day,
the feature being the unusual close
ness of the betting. The following are

PACIFIC CRICKET CLUB.
â¢
The Pacific cricket eleven defeated
the Alameda team yesterday in the
match on the ground at "Webster street,
Alameda, by the handsome margin^of
104 runs. This victory was due to the
excellent batting of Wllkes (104) and
Wilding (58). When five wickets were
down for 197 Captain Myers called the
Innings. Harold Ward was the most
successful of the Alameda bowlers,
capturing four wickets for 63 runs.
Wilkes' score included five fours.
The Alameda team were all out for
93 runs, Lannowe capturing three
wickets. Dr. Taylor and Wilkes two
each and Casidy one. The best score
was Harold Ward's 26. The full details
follow:
The rank and file of the men who fol
low boxing do not think for a moment
that Jeffries is afraid of Munroe, or o?
any other man. The true Inwardness of
the affair is expected to develop shortly.
"If the forfeit is posted by Jeffries
to-day I will take my miner away with
me to the East about the middle of the
week, and if it is not posted we will
make our get-away on Tuesday morn
ing. There are many engagements la
the East to occupy our attention at the
present time. I do not see any use in
hanging around these parts in quest of
more champions â especially the kind
who will not fight."
There Is a growing impression that
the apparent apathy of the public to
ward the bis fight Ls at the bottom ot
Jeffries' sudden indisposition. He wa3
fit to fight for the championship ten.
days ago. and If a big attendance had
been in sight the fight would probably
have been decided by thi3 time.
The final echoes of the sayings about
the heavy-weight championship fight
are dying away, and within the next
few days the general public will have
forgotten all about the big fellows.
It is expected the forfeits Â£or the pro
posed meeting in August will be posted
to-day. At least they should be posted,
and Harry Pollock says there will be
no stage* money in the transaction thi*
time, lie is desirous of getting a
glimpse at the hue of Jeffries' coin and
wants to see it in the hands of a repu
table stakeholder, like Harry Corbett.
Pollock, in company with Manager
James Ccff roth of the Yosemite Club,
arrived last night from Harbin Springs.
The trip to the stronghold of the cham
pion did not serve to increase the Xe\v
Yorker's admiration for the big fellow.
He has all kinds of things to say about
Jeff, and naturally they are chiefly un
complimentary.
"I spoke my mind rather freely to the
champion," said Pollock last night. 'I
think I had a license to do so, for I
found him in bed looking as big as the
side of a house and more bale and
hearty than he has ever appeared be
fore. That sore knee? Oh, I forgot it.
It's a joke. That knee is good enough
for any chamÂ»ion to fight with, but
Jeffries does not like the game he's up
against, and, of course, the sore knee
complaint comes in quite handy under
the circumstances.

California Schuetzen Club, prize winners at
bullseye shoot:
- In the Turners' competition H. Enge
was high man with 201 and 204 rings
to his credit. Captain F. Attinger was
his "closest competitor, with 193.
O. Imdorf of the Grutli Shooting Sec
tion carried off first honors in the
bullseye contest with a good center
shot. His nearest competitor was A.
de Filippi.
The rifle ranges at Schuetzen Park
presented a busy scene yesterday.
Members of the California Schuetzen
Club, Grutli Shooting Section and the
Turner's Schuetzen were all oc
cupied in an effort to outdo each other
at the targets. M. F. Hartter of the
California Schuetzen Club was high
man of the day in the bullseye contest,
with a score of 481 points.
L. Wille, the Tyrolean sharpshooter,
surprised his new comrades by the
ease with which he placed center shots.
He finished third.
Outside of the championship match
there was but little play yesterday.
Following are the scores of the prac
tice matches of the day: C. J. Smith
and C. G. Kuehn beat Clarence Griffin
and James A. Code 6-2. 6-4, 5-7; H.
Spring beat E. P. Robbins 6-3; H.
Haight beat M. Long 6-3. 6-4. 7-5; M.
Johnson beat C G. Kuehn 7-5, 6-0.
Thus ended the second annual com
petition for the handsome silver trophy
presented to the California Tennis Club
by J. D. Grant as an emblem of the
championship of San Francisco. It has
to be won three times by the same
player before becoming his permanent
ly. MacGavin was the first winner,
and now he hands it over to Murdock
to retain for one year, and longer if
he can.
Murdock started out to make a run
away match of it. running the score
up to h-l before MacGavin shook oif
the listless style of play with which
he started. When his opponent needed
but one point to win the first set he
seemed to awake to the situation, and
by exerting himself retrieved that
game and took the next, making the
score 5-3, and arousing the hopes of his
friends. . Murdock put an end to this
brief rally by taking the next game
handily, and with it the set. The fol
lowing is <he complete score: 6-3, 6-8,
6-4. 6-3.
MacGavin, on the other hand, affect
c-d the back court, seldom going up to
the net, and probably his defeat was
largely due to this, though few men
could have beaten Murdock's net play.
A new tennis champion took his place
yesterday at the head of the list of
the racket wielders. Before the largest
crowd of spectators ever gathered on
the California Club courts, Percy Mur-
Uock of Alameda, the challenger,
wrested the championship 1 from J.
Drummond MacGavin, the holder of
the trophy and titlg for the past year.
Murdock won decisively and on his
merits, taking three sets out of four.
The spectators saw some good tennis,
though both players were somewhat
overcautious. This detracted from
MacGavins game, as he is spectacular
when at his best at driving and smash
ing. The match was closer than the
figures of the score indicate, Â«ls every
point was stubbornly contested, many
ot" the games seesawing from deuce to
vantage and back again repeatedly be
fore eithtr player could win. The spec
tators followed the play with great in
terest. Excitement ran high and con
tinued throughout the match, and the
applause was frequent and impartial.
Murdock proved his right to the
championship by strong, consistent
skillful play throughout the tourna
ment, lie was not fortunate in the
drawing, having to fight his way from
the preliminaries to the position of
challenger against a succession of the
strongest players of the California and
the Park olubs. He won all the way
on his merits, losing but one set in the
tournament, and but one against the
champion. He played the net game
persistently yesterday, invariably fol
lowing up his service. Few players
have shown more brilliantly at the net
than he did. His volleying of Mac-
Gavin's lightning drives and his cross
court strokes have seldom been excel
led.
The East will claim it Is a distinct
victory, but this will be combated by
Western critics, who will point out the
fact that Highball is a Western colt,
having been bred by T. J. Carson at
Dixonia stud in Kentucky. His trainer,
J. U. May, is a Kentucky man and does
all of his winter and early spring train
ing at Menjphis. The horse has never
raced anywhere but in the East, and
being owned by a Xew Yorker, he will
be claimed as an Eastern horse. Some
of the horsemen will not admit that
Highball is the best colt. Ben Phillips,
who trained English Lad, said to-day:
"I will run my colt against Highball
within forty-eight or seventy-two
hours. I would like to arrange a
special match before Highball returns
to Xew York Just to see what they can
do when th*Â»re is nothing else in tns
race to bother them. Let them carry
the same weights and race to-morrow
or Tuesday at a mile ana a half or a
mile and a quarter. I don't care which.
The same boys to ride and all other
conditions to be what they were yes
terday. Then we will see a horse race."
When the proposition was made-ln an
unofficial way to "Bud" May, the
trainer of Highball, he smiled and said
he would ship his horses back East.
"Highball has some engagements on
the Eastern tracks that are valuable,
and we are anxious to return there,"
May said. "It would not pay us to re
main in the West. I like It out here,
being practically a Western man, and
would like nothing better than the
pleasure of seeing Highball defeat Eng
lish Lad once more, for he surely would
do so. But even a side bet of $5000 or
more would not tempt me.!'
"Bud" May, who trained Highball,
had almost to quarrel with W. M.
Scheftel, the owner of the horse, before
the Xew York millionaire would permit
him to shiD the son of Ben StromÂ« to
Chicago. Scheftel was so badly disap
pointed over the result of the Brooklyn
Derby a week ago In New York that he
at once declared the horse out of the
race. May's advice finally prevailed
and Highball was shiped West.
CHICAGO, June 19.â Highball Is the
king: of three-year-olds. By winning
the American Derby yesterday the son
of Ben Mrome clearly and decisively
won the title. The Eastern cold demon
strated his superiority in a fashion long
to be remembered.

TACOMA. Wash., June 19. â Jimmy
Whalen broke San Francisco's losing
streak by pitching his team to victory
this morning. A shutout was pre
vented by bunching Lynch's pingie'And
two-base hits by Casey and McDonald
in one inning. McDonald, a new
southpaw, showed up fairly well
after being out of the game. An in
ar.d-out game was played in the after
r.ooa with the locals getting the big
*nd. Well placed hits and scientific
sr-.criScing helped San Francisco to
t ;ve. With one to the bad the Tigers
von out in the seventh in a grand-
F^tnd rally. McLaughlin triple!.
Hogan doubled. Overall sacrificed and
Nordyke hit for two bases, bringing
in enough to win. Overall pitched a
pood game and outpointed Yerkes, al
though the latter was effective at
times. Both teams fielded in splendid
ftyle. Nordyke and Hogan led the
batters, while Miller and Irwin did
t-ome exceptionally clever work in the
tif-ld. Scores:

PORTLAND. June 19.â When Moski
man slammed the ball against the
richt field fence after Schiatley had
s-ingled in the eighth inning this after
noon, there was nothing to it but Oak
land, so the commuters won by a score
â¢ â¢f 4 to 1. Muskiir.an's hit tied the
KCcre. For seven innings the game
was more than worth the money. Roach
and Cooper were the masters at arms
and they delighted the crowd.
For six and a half innings Oakland
could not g-et a man past second. In
the teventh Thielman shot to left for
i wo ba?es. and Beck sacrificed. Thiel
i:ian scored when Francis died on a
pop fly. back of first.
Oakland found Roach for a single
and a double in the eighth. In the
next tvy innings Roach held the com
muters safe, but he weakened in the
eleventh and the game was lost. The

Notice to Pat>srnsers,
Andrew Johnson of 413 Folsom street
went fishing yesterday afternoon at
Bakers Beach and had an experience
he does not care to repeat soon again.
For sorr.e time he was in danger of
being drowned, but was saved by the
life caving crew from Fort Point after
the Gcldca Gate crew had failed to
launch their boat in the heavy sea.
Johnson left his home early in the
<lay and proceeded to the coast intend
ing to spend the day tishing, as he fre
quently dues on Sunday. Abyut 4
o'clock he reached Bakers Beach and
tcck a position on the rocks which ex
tend out into the ocean, with stretches
of water Ixtween them at high tide but
Â¦which can be reached when the water
is low by Jumping from rock to rock.
The farther out the better the fishing,
and as Johnson had not had very good
luck near shore he went as far as he
could. Intent on the sport he failed
to notice the rifinp waters, and before
he was aware of his danger his retreat
had been cut off and the breakers be
gan to lash the rock upon which he
stood with increasing fury, for the sea
took on a more dangerous aspect as
the day began to wane.
The dangerous position occupied by
Johnson was recognized from the beach
v.-hen he was F?en signaling for relief.
Word was pent to the Golden Gate life
savins crew and it was found to be
necessary to launch the boat t<> rescue
the man. Strong southwest winds were
blowing, ihrowinR spray high into the
air and causing the sea to break on the
beach with such force that when an
effort was made to launch the lifeboat
it was drivrn back twice and landed
hiph and dry. The man's life was in
danger, and prompt action was neces
sary. Word was telephoned to the Fort
Point crew regarding "the conditions on
the Golden Gate beach and requesting
the Fort Point crew to get the man
rff. That plan was followed and John-
Fon was landed at 6:45 none the worse
for his experience, beyond being wet
and frightened. He went home and
hereafter will watch the tide more
closely when he goes fishing at Bakers
Reach.
Sunday rabbit driving at Golden
Gate Park is making a stronger bid
for popularity every week. Yesterday
the soulful "um-to-tas" of Steindorff's
brasses were almost drowned in the
yells of small boys who chased ' the
elusive cottontails under the benches
and over the lawns of the music con
course.
At this season the feeding in the un
cultivated parts of the park is unpala
table and the rabbits bring their fam
ilies to the cultivated sections. The
crowd of Sunday visitors pouring
toward the Spreckels Music Stand un
intentionally forms a rabbit drive,
penning the little animals within the
barriers of humanity. Then the small
boy shines.
As the strains of the national hymn
blared forth yesterday little Willie Mc-
Grummit, the nine-year-old heir of
John McGrummit of 407 Rose avenue,
was seated quietly between pa and ma.
Suddenly a one-eared rabbit popped out
from under the bench. W.illie was a
sportsman and could not stay. Stein
dorff's most impressive gestures failed
to hold his eye and the noble music of
"America" lost its charms. With a
screech he gave chase.
Over the first bench into a basket
ful of ham sandwiches leaped Willie.
He overturned a baby carriage and,
darting between the colossal legs of a
fat man, sent their owner to earth
with a plaintive "oof."
Pa started after Willie and ma tod
dled behind pa. Two fox terriers and
a bull dog joined in the 'chase. El
bowing, squirming and fighting his
way through the throng went the de
termined huntsman, followed by his
convoy. Before him the white tuft of
the cottontail waved like the plume on
the helmet of Navarre.
A crowd of sedate Germans sat
listening entranced to Schubert's
"Serenade." Suddenly came the cry,
"There he goes!" The next moment
the hare leaped the hurdle of spell
bound Germans and over went their
bench in the surprise of the moment.
The hunters in full cry trotted over
the fallen. Grayhounds may be fleeter,
but Willie had perseverance. People
6Jood on chairs and benches to watch
trie progress of the hunt.
Bunny grew tired and began to look
for escapes. After a weary circle he
leaped up on to the bandstand during
the intermission. The bass horn lay
invitingly near. Here was an invitin?
retreat, thought Bre'r Rabbit, and in
he jumped. With a cry of triumph
little Willie plunged his head and
shoulders into the instrument. He
stuck. For several minutes a bass
horn mounted on a pair of small legs
capered about the platform emitting
more painful sounds than it ever
breathed even in Wagnerian selections.
Then pa extricated his offspring from
the brassware. Little Willie had two
black eyes, hardly any skin on his
face and less clothing on his frame,
but there was a cherubic grin on his
countenance and in his right hand he
held' the one-eared rabbit.
As the band wafted up sweet strains
from "Erminie" a wail that blended
ill with the music arose from the rear
of the bandstand. Little Willie was
getting what was coming to him.
The one-eared rabbit loped quietly
homeward to the sand dunes. .

ENGAGEMENTS.
Society daily slackens its pace, hav
ing during the last week come almost
to a full stop. But with the few wed
dings and betrothals of June, com
plete stagnation is averted.
Even the energetic card clubs have
gone into summer seclusion, but 'tis
â¢whispered that "bridge" and "500"
have hosts of devotees at the sum
mer resorts.
Oakland has made an arrest for vio
lation of the cofnpulsory education law
and has secured a conviction. The case
was tried before Police Judge Samuels,
and the father of the truant lad was
found guilty of misdemeanor. Now the
course of the case will be interesting,
as it is in reality a test of the new law.
In defense of himself the father claimed
that he was ill. and the little ladâun
der 14 years to come under the law â
was forced to become a breadwinner
for. himself and his eight brothers and
sisters. The Judge apparently, was un
moved by. the ..prolific -parent's plaint,
and his decision is upheldâ morallyâ by
every- friend of wronged childhood. No
doubt In due time there will be more
babes for the little fellow to feed from
his withered little hand. Is this not a
crimeâ this flooding" the world with
babes that must seek the food they
eat? ... ,- â¢ â¢
The Sacramento Woman's Council,
department of moral reform, is making
an investigation of the penny arcades
in tho capital, bringing to light a diver
sity of opinions as to the legitimacy of
some of thft pictures shown therein.
But, of course, that is a difficult matter
to decide. What might suggest immor
ality to one, might be an exalted ex
pression of art to another. And there
you are!
Though in summer session, the Cali
fornia Club is doing things through its
civic section. In previous years, the
redoubtable small boy has been permit
ted to blow off a thumb on the Fourth
of July or some one else's thumb at
will, and no one said him nay. But
on the statute books stands a law.
rather stiff in the joints for lack of
exercise, prohibiting the sale of blank
cartridges to minors. Now. the club
women are desirous of bringing forth
the old law, by its promulgation to
savÂ» the emergency hospital its usual
"busy day" on the Fourth.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Now can a decent lodging be given
the litt el tykes, a bath and a clean,
wholesome bedâ the very first elements
that conduce to reform." And for this one
humane thing let some of the super
visorial sins be forgotten.
Among the societies supporting the
institution backing the Juvenile Court
law are the California Club, the Asso
ciated Charities, the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty. to Children, the
Youth's Directory, the Boys' and Girls'
Aid Society and the Church Home for
Boys. By a self-imposed tax, these
humanitarian bodies are paying the
salaries of the .two probation officers,
Miss Londa Stebbins and her assistant,
Mr. Hutton. What the interest will be,
in the years to come, when the little
wanderers will have been disciplined
and trained into good citizenship, is a
pleasant prospective. But it will come
â the old law of cause and effect work
ing out its truth.
The Board of Health has notified the
Chief of Police that he must make
other provision for the girls and boys
being held for the Juvenile Court- than
in the basement of the Central Emer
gency Hospital. At no time was the
sunless basement a fit place to house
the little waifs of the city's streets,
but being the only available place of
fered, it. was glad^' accepted.
But now the tale is different. There
is money in prospect now, $5000 obtain
ed' by the grace of the Supervisors,
which was earnestly, prayed for by the
good men and women who constitute
the Juvenile Court Committee, Dr.
Dorothea Moore, chairman.
At the imperial reception, the Amer
ican women, as usual, were* engulfed
with honors and attentions. Distinct
ly, we should feel grumpy had Berlin
not manifested such excellent discrim
ination. Didn't San Francisco send on
Mrs. John F. Swift? Now, where
could a handsomer or ay cleverer
woman be fuund than the widow of
the former Minister to Japan? As
suredly, . the Berliners are clever peo
ple. Perhaps we can return the com
pliment some day, when the fraus and
the frauleins may foregather in our
burg.
In connection with the reported an
tipathy of the Empress to the civic ac
tivity of. women, the announcement
loses much weight from the fact she
tendered the visiting delegates a recep
tidn, and expressed herself well pleased
with the. action of Berlin in voting to
entertain the visitors with a farewell
banquet.
Following close upon the suffrage de
bate In the Quinquennial Convention
in Berlin, comes the action of the
Reichstag, in expunging from the law
providing for mercantile arbitration
tribunals the clause that would give
to the German woman the right to the
ballot. Now, the wildest proselyte
never dreamed for a minute that
the thoroughly respectable Reichstag
would grant suffrage to German
women. But down deep in their hearts
there is much rejoicing over what is
really a great victoryâ that the issue
was of such import as to command
the attention of the righteous Reich
stag-. Of course, it was due to the
Socialists that the measure was so
excelleifily exploited.
Now that thf wedge is in the Ger
man political plank, who knows what
the next quinquennial will bring forth?
Jt is said that much fun was poked
at Count von Bulow. the Imperial
Chancellor, and at Count Posadowski-
Wehner. Minister of the Interior, both
of whom voted against the suffrage
measure as became such high-caste
dignitaries, but whose wives were val
iant supporters of the leaders of the
"American" movement. - Who knows
but the poor women hath need of
the ballot or some legitimate weapon?
