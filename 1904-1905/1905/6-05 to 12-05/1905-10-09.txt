growth of the- thanksgiving service in
Christ Church at Portsmouth, which
followed the signing of the peace treaty
between Russia and Japan and at which
priests of the Episcopal and Russian
churches officiated. â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
The new organization will follow the
lines of "The Eastern Church Associa

have branches' ln all dioceses of the Epis

of the promoters be successful.
It it said that within l the past half
dozen years the relations between the

BUEXOS ATRES. Oct. 3.â Employes ot
the Central Argentine and Buenos Ayres-
Rosario railways have declared a strike,
the companies having refused their condi
tions. The police have arrested several
mechanics, who will be sued for having
left work without giving notice, as estab
lished by law.
President Quintana sent a message to
Congress requesting authority to pro
claim a state of siege in the capital and
the provinces of Buenos Ayres and Santa
Fe. . He believed that the state of siege
was the best means of impeding the
spread of the strike movement.
Congress Immediately voted a state of
siege throughout the country. All papers
censure the resolution, saying the Gov
ernment should try to settle conflicts be
tween capital and labor instead of em
ploying coercive measures.
More military forces have been sent' to
Rosario de Santa Fe. It is thought tho*
strikers there are calm. A meeting will
be he, ld in Rosario to diacnai the project
of a- general strike. The committee of the
Labor Federation says that the state of
siege will make matters worse and cause
exasperation among the workingmen.
Business In the harbors of Buencs Ayrcs
and Rosario has been almost completely
paralyzed. "
News of the strike will not be permit
ted to be published.

WONG KAI KAH
HURRYING HOME
China's Trade Conimissioner
After Two Months' Visit
Is Summoned to Peking-
EMPEROR WANTS HIM
Says His People Are Deeply
Interested ' in % Agitiitioh
Here Over Exclusion Act
Wong Kal Kah, China's conimissioner
of trade to the United States and Japan
aud who has spent the last two months in
this country visiting the big manufactur
ing establishments with a view of getting
ideas, as to what is most needed in his
country in the way of machinery for the
production of various implements of war
and the furtherance of 'industrial inter
ests, arrived tiere yesterday on his way
to Peking, to which he has l>een sum
moned by his Emperor. It was the inten
tion of Commissioner Kah to remain sav
era"l months in this country before re
turning to' Japan, where his present' offi
cial duiies bigan, and his recall was some
what of a. surprise. Whether he is to be
assigned to some other important duty lie
is unable to say. Of his visit to this
country and the tecent reports to the ef
fect that his presence here was partially
in cohhtction with the settlement of the
troubles between Russia and Japan he
baid yesterday at the Palace Hotel:
"J had expected to remain here several
months, and cannot offer any explanation
as to why I have been sent for. Being in
the diplomatic service, of course, often
Â«_&Â£_ one to . many surprises and
changes. The report that 1 had anything
to Oo with the Russo-Japanese treaty
as a representative of China is entirely
erroneous, for It should be understood
that China was not officially represented
at the poace conference in the East."
â¢ AMCRKAXS THâIB. EXAMPLE.
W'onr Kal Kah also denied that he had
acted while in this country in any official
capacity in connection with the boycott
of American goods in China! but he dis
eutS'U vhe matter in an interesting way,
rate-rating his statements made in the
Kasr anu here "bhortly aftt-r his arrival ,
from the Orient. â¢
i am confident," said he, "that the
trouble will be -satisfactorily settlÂ«-<l: Of ;
i curs*;, our people are greatly disturbed:
over the exclusion law. We have no ob
jection to the United States regulating
the immigration of the laboring elements
from various foreign countries, but what
\u25a0we want is lor your people to clearly de
fine what a laborer is. It Is probably a
diflicult matter to discriminate between
the laboring and other classes that come
to your shores, but X think it can be done.
It has been suggested that the matter be
left to the consular officials in the Orient
or to a commission sect, there for that
purpose and witb the authority to vise
all passports.
'My sent.mer.ts ate practically those of
my Government. The Chinese fully ap
preciate the fact that they owe much to
the I'nited States, for the open-door pol
icy cf Secretary Hay greatly strength
ened the. Chinese and we feel exceedingly
grateful to you for many acts performed
ln.ihe interest of ourselves as a "nation.
The '"recent movement in China against
American goods was due to the action of
the merchant or gentry class, who keenly
feel the restrictions that have * been
placed upon them in this., country,., to
whjch Uuy'have been eager to send their
children to be educated.'
CONDITIONS ARES CHANGING.
Conditions have been changing notice
ably in China. In the olden tumes the
merchants never thought of traveling be
yond the borders of their country, but
with the" remarkably increasing import
trade, which has already reached- the
$250,000,000 mark, and "will probably reach
$300,000,000 thts year, the Chinese have
awakened to the necessity of traveling, if
hi- desires to imjjrove his own business
interests.
"For instance, there are many articles
manufactured in America that are not
suitable to Chinese, but would be if they
\u25a0were slightly altered. The Chinese mer
chant^ keenly appreciative of this fact
and is anxious to come to the United
States, with a view to talking direct to
the manufacturer as: to just how these
articles can be made adaptable to the
Oriental requirements. They are not
laborers and do not come here to com
pete with your laboring classes. They
simply come to open up new elements of
business. Naturally they want the same
courtesies from your Government that
are .extended to visitors from other for
eign- countries. Our" merchants .think"'' a
good deal of themselves and, with yielr
money ready to pay for what they get,
they believe that they are entitled to
every comfort that. they can pay for and
that is due them from the Government In
trie way of a courtesy. They also like to
buy their own coods direct, instead of
through the medium of a commission
house.
ASKS US TO BE LKNIEXT.
"Another thing, our young men like to
perfect their education. They have learn
â¬â¢4 that your colleges and schools are as
good, if not better, than those in other
countries and they are eager, to get the'
best advantages. One great example thf
Americans ! have set for the CU*rÂ»et>fc U
the fact that all people in this country;
whether rich or poor, have to work. For
years the belief existed among, the gentry
class of China that work 'was degrading.
M,any of them still entertain that theorjr
and our people would like to see them
tafce more to work. SUH another rea
son why the United- States should not
intake the restriction upon Chinese too
Beyere is the fact that it is now a requirel
mejit In two of the Chinese provinces.
Chili .and. Hu Non, that all officials, be
fore entering upon their duties shall
have traveled abroad for at least six
niohtbs. ' * Thfe v provision was re'comrnen'd
ed- to the Crown by the covernora of
these two provinces and was prompt
ly acted upon through a proclamation.
Irf short, China is doing everything pos
eitile to foster an ambition among her
people to improve their social and Indus
trial conditions on a plane with those in
this country, and to accomplish this
great purpose the more intelligent classes
are hot>eful that the United States will"
be- lenient toward us, without inuring
the welfare of her own laboring people.
ROYAL. COMMISSION COMING.
;*Eviderfce that China fully comprehends
the greatness of the United States as a
nation Is shown by the fact that a royal
commission, headed by Prince Tsal Chi. ,
a. ..cousin of the. Emperor, and composed
of **: cabinet minister, the vice president
of the board of revenue and the Governor
of, the province of Hu Non, Is on Its way
to this country for the purpose of care
fully studying the political conditions
here. : The commission would have been
here, within the next, few weeks but for
the attack made upon the Prince a week
ago by $, bomb thrower.- The members
of the -commission will spend consider
able time In Washington, where they will
secure copies of your constitution and of
all kinds of official literature that may be
of benefit to them In framing a report te
theirisEnjperoT. We already have a civil
service, -which guarantees equal oppor
tunities to. the rich- and poor to secure
governmental positions, provided- the Â«ext
amina tlon is successfully passed. As a
naatt er of fact there is no cast* ia China.

LOUISVILLE, Ky., Oct. 8. â Officials
of Spanish War Veterans to-day
learned that it would be impossible for
them to obtain control of Lincoln's
birthplace, as its owner. R. J. Collier,
of New York, had decided to present it
to the Federal Government for a na

\u25a0with this arrangement, as they had in

A weak stomach is most fre-
quently caused by the over-
worked and exhausted nervous
eystem.
The power that runs the:
stomach is the'nerve force sent
to it from the brain through
the nerves. When the nerves
are weak or exhausted the sup-
ply of energy is insufficient
and the action of -the stomach
is impaired, and results in im-
perfect digestion â dyspepsia.
Dr. Miles' Restorative Nerv-
ine increases nerve force. It
strengthens and builds up nerve
tissue, gives vigor to the nerves
and muscles of the stomach;
this produces a healthy activity.
Nervine allays the inflamma-
tion, heals the membranes, arid
makes the stomach strong and
healthy. There is nothing that
sa quickly gives energy to the
whole system as Restorative
Nervine.
"I can't say enonjjh for Dr. .Mile*'
Nervine. I don't know what ir will
to for others, but It certainly cured me .'
of stomach trouble, aad now I.ara a*
well as I ever was. Two physician*

I SCENE AT CORNERSTONE LAY
ING. AND PRESIDENT OF GER
MAN ASSOCIATION.
TV>wer above us, oh proud temple, monument
â¢of German might, . .
Stand for honesty of purpose; stand for har
,mony and rijht."
, These words, reverently spoken, the
gentle thrice tapping of a time-honored
trowel upon a massive block of gran
ite, the glad raising of the German
flag, an American pennant streaming
proudly above It. and the laying^ of the
corner-stone of the new German HoÂ«
pital was triumphantly completed yes
terday morning. Simple was the cere
mony, as befitted the great silent work
of relieving suffering humanity for
which the building Is to stand.
President Henry Epstein pronounced'
the dedicating words and reviewed
briefly the history of the hospital and
the German General Benevolent So
ciety, which has fostered it since its
very beginning, half a century ago. He
told of the earnestness of purpose
which hap characterized the society
since its early days and the realization
of its fondest dream In the new hos
pital building. A. chorus of fifty voices
sang two German hymns. A poem
written by H. Glauch was read by Jo
seph Greven, addresses were made by-
Henry U. Brandensteln, German Con
sul Franz Bopp and A. Roncovierl and
a song of gladness and., praise com
pleted the exercises of the day.
HOSPITAL ON SPLENDID GROUNDS.
, The new German Hospital, now but
partly completed, will be one of the
fin%st hospital buildings ; in : the world.
It -is being erected on the site of the
old hospital between Thirteenth arid
Fourteenth streets on Noe.' It will- be
seven stories high," constructed '; entire
ly of fire-proof material and when
finally completed will be equipped
wlth^ the latest inventions known to
medical scientists. Its view Is mag
nificent. It overlooks the Bay of; San
Francisco and the entire eastern
water front of . the city. Spacious
grou n ds . surround It and the ;. warm
sunlight sheds -.unobstructed , rays over
it. ; The estimated cost will be $400,000.
As soon as sufficient > headway": is made
the Inmates, of the wooden
will be moved into : the \ new structure
At the laying of ; the corner-atone"
were many, members -. of ," ;"the :".'\u25a0 German
General Benevolent Society and friends
of that . organization. In front of : the
gathering on the floor of the building
sat the twelve nurses. -each dressed; in

PRESIDENT EPSTEIN IS GRATEFUL.
President Epstein spoke In part as*
follows: \u25a0 .'
It gives me great pleasure to greet you to
day In the name of the German General Be
nevolent Association, particularly as the occa
sion is such a Joyous Â»one.
This is the third time since, the exislenceof
our organization that we have gathered for the
purpose of celebrating the laying of a corner
stone. ... .--:".
. We can conscientiously claim that the under
taking of the eighty-two gentleman which,
though planned already, in, September, 1852, in
the .rooms of the San Francisco .Verein, but
only materialized on the 7th of January. 1854,
has borne goodly fruits. The child called into
existence at that time, after passing success
fully through all the unavoidable stages of chil
dren's diseases, thanks to the careful nursing
and good nourishment "given to it, has now
grown into a strong man, v giant I might even
say. .\u25a0 ' ,'.;. -, - - : \u25a0\u25a0 â¢ : . .â¢\u25a0 . \u25a0 . â¢\u25a0\u25a0 . .,
Only those en ' the board at the time can
testify jto the extent of the work accomplished
âonly i they are/ qualified to say how many
.sick have been relieved ana how many . needy
have been helped. .. ~ . i
On the night of the 2Sth of August, 1876, our |
hospital, then on Brannan street. * was de
stroyed by fire. .. Fortunately', there were no
casualties to record while the, sick.
It was, through the . sacrifice of 'our German
citizens, -ably assisted by our German : women
and supplemented by the' wellrknown Califor-,
nian generosity at large; that \u25a0â¢ we -1 were en-*<
abled : in July of ; the following year to: lay, the
corner-stone of our second hospital. A' total
expenditure for this building, was $88,241. The
cost of our present \u25a0 structure ' will .be about
$400,000. and It is Intended to meet all possible
requirements of . tho ; times. .When s completed
It will undoubtedly prove 'an honor to the Ger
man population, and an ornament to the city. ; ,7
- MUST KEEP lIP WITH NEEDS. ;
Some , thirty \u25a0 years ; ago, not far - from this
spot, our never to be forgotten Mr. Meussdorffer '
used this trowel on a 1a 1 similar occasion.." He ex
pressed - a .wish that it might ' never be,: used
again for a like purpose. , However,' if he were:
with us to-day he would certainly think other
wise and consider it a most auspicious omen,
for. at that- time the ;loss * of -our: hospital by
fire : necessitated , its use â to-day It i meana the
growing needs. - and a wish to \u25a0 keep \u25a0up - with
he progress of tho. world. \u25a0';â¢<
No doubt there are* some ; of ; you ; whQ may
hink that i our undertaking ; is â¢ planned |on â¢ too
arge a scale, â¢; but . to those â¢ I beg v to cay ; that
'Â»t is necessary/tn. look -to-the; future, v The ;

PRAISES - GERMAN THOROUGHNESS.
Henry U. ; Brandensteln. ; whose father
has long been Identified 'with : the Ger-~

: : If \u25a0 there Â» is s one ; trait ; above :\u25a0\u25a0 all -: other* . that
characterizes i the - German^ people.-. It t Is : thor
oughness,^ the ability, and i willingness not alone
to do a thing', . but to do it .well | fundamentally.
And : how., well * this > trait ' Is exemplified \u25a0In \ tha
ceremonies "â¢ of ; this ' day. ''ft You 'i are i building ? a

, The science of medicine and I the ' art of sani

quate ' for â¢ your/; purposes. '^Without â¢: hesitation
you . devote \u25a0 your * energies ? and ?â¢ your r resources

mi croscopist and the bacteriologist work tlre-
lessly in' their sclentflc researches. : The re
sults of these researches are eagerly snatched
up â¢by the practitioner and - put. Into forceful
application at the bedside. ~:
The scientific spirit of the German is only
another Illustration of his disposition for thor
oughnesss. With the ' German, thoroughness Is
a religion. I am not in any way attempting:
to put Into r your 'oars empty compliments. â¢ I
seek onjy; to. direct, your attention to the one
particular virtue of the German folk that sym
bolises these ceremonies. â¢â\u25a0 - It -Is well for > the
American people; that It -enjoys the stimulus
of this virtue of the Germans, thia virtue that
scants nothing, and preserves t very, detail.- 1
And every institution . that the German popu
lation establishes in an . American community
to perpetuate that spirit is . a permanent con
tribution to American civilization.

* Dead Body of His Mother
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HASTINGS. Neb.. OctT B.â A family
quarrel of long standing, due primarily
to disputes, over the father's property,
reached a climax this morning, when
John Budnek, aged 50. shot his sister,
his . brother and his brother-in-law
over the dead body of their mother,
-which the undertakers were preparing
for burial. , No one . was seriously in
jured. ' ' â¢ ,

Mrs. , Dr. Naulteus. Mrs. Budnek: died
a little before : midnight and." John,
hearing, of ..her death, forced his way
into the house' and into the de.ath
chamber/Walking up"to,the body he
said. "This is my mother."
.His sister France^.; standing near,
said something in Polish, apparently
remonstrating with him. . and John
struck her in the face. 'Then,' drawing
hir gun, he fired at her over the body
of his mother. Mr. Smeall Interceded
and John shot him. in the breast. The
two men clinched and both fell 'to the
floor. Budnek. who was thrown on his
back, continued to shoot During the
fray a lighted lamp w?/Â» upset and the
parlor curtains took fire. The; under
taker: and his. 'assistant managed to
throw the lamp- out of the window and
to snatch the gun from Budnek's.hand.
He at; once pulled another revolver,
however, and continued shooting. Ja
cob, another, brother, was hit :Dy a
stray bullet before the man was' finally
disarmed and pinioned, to the floor. .
John Budnek is now in the County
Jail, where he declared this afternoon
that he had # no knowledge of the shoot
ing. He expressed great surprise when
told what he had done, although ad
mitting a dim recollection of having

\u25a0 Speaking of the proposed : changes in
the tax laws of the State/, Professor
Plehn said to-day; quoting in 'part from
documents he has prepared: . .'"';.'/
The present tax system of . California is
antiquated. It was two hundrtd year* old
when first adopted in this State,- and has not
been essentially modified during the fifty years
that: we have used it. Meanwhile the State
has outgrown th-s simple conditions of econ
omic life/ to which ; alone the system' was
adapted, and in capital and wealth, in indus
trial , and . commercial methods, \u25a0 is now tike
those great States on the Atlantic which have
found it necessary to revise their tax sys
tems to meet the - conditions of mod-rn life.
The burden of the support of the Government
falls most unequally upon those who should
hear it. It falls. with special severity. upon the
poor and with the greatest Â»e verity upon the
honest.' TbÂ« present system of taxation is
highly conducive to political immorality and
is a veritable school for perjury. -, It- fails.al
together to reach the new forms of^ property
which have developed during, they past fifty
yeart. or to r?ach the new kinds of ability that
should contribute to the public needs. . Per
sonal ' property . notoriously escapes â¢ * taxation,
and about (55 per cent of tho entlre;burden t of
maintaining government is '.borne by' tlÂ»> own
ers or real estate alone. \u25a0\u25a0"â¢ Our : best' efforts : at
equalization fall utterly of accomplishing what
they 'are -Intended to aocompllah at*,d 5 that ion
account pf difficulties inherent In 3 thej system.

â¢ In compliancy with established custom, sons
of California throughout :the ; State are met this
attfernoon to \u25a0 pay; a : tribute vt. respect and af
fectiun to. the memory of inose who have passed
from the valley of the shadow of death to the
great beyond and to bow our heads In sympathy
â¢svith those whose hearts arc torn by the agony
of recent personal bereavement. . .
i\e our order has grown from Its Infancy and
Childhood to the estate of young manhood there
has come a truer conception or comparison and
proportion, a most mature appreciation of the
value of, high ideals, and. .while still retaining
the vigor and buoyancy of youth, we have come
to choose practices' which tend to elevate an t
enable and .which \u25a0 stimulate â¢' and develop' the
highest "and best. ,â¢ :
; Memorial; services are, first of all and above
all, an avowal of our firm and steadfast belief
In. lmmortality. : Without Â»uch an abiding faith
the celebration of the day would be a delusion
and a mockery. It announces our firm convic
tion that death la but a temporary separationâ'
a curtain hung between two stages Qf exist
ence." -'_'.'- . . â¢;\u25a0 .'-. -;.-'â¢ '.' ....

''From the Depths."
In responding to : the opening remarks
District Attorney John J. Allen said in
part: . * : - '\u25a0
Assembled Friends and Brothers:, We arÂ«
here to honor \u25a0 the \u25a0 memory of those -who -have
passed away,- even before their allotted time. of.
i life. - Those who have passed away were sons
: of \u25a0 fathers , who were \u25a0 pioneers of this Golden
State/- and . those .whom we ! respect, to-day are
pioneers of groaf beyondâ of the, eternity .to
which they have ' gone to . prepare ;us a home.

â¢ Our State han but passed the half century

â¢ The .'quartet .'\u25a0 sang , "Lead, j Kindly
Light," and Judge John F. Davis of Am
ador County delivered the eulogy.' Among
other things he said:
'. From one year's end to another too many of
us have no idea of the perspective of the prob
lems of - life â¢ till we stand in the | presence of
death. Too many of us move along as If hyp
notized ,by the storm ani stress of . occupation
in'the outer world, till the death of a.near one
brings us to our senses and shocks ue into a
realization of the spiritual life. For these and
also for, those -who -have all their lives strug
gled 1 to obtain in some practical' way a right
apprehension of .the reality of the spiritual life,
it is good to meet once a year in a service . in .
memory of those who have tor a year gone be
fore us and to -voice in the simple language of
every day lite the thoughts that arise within us
âto, grow' serious, and :to realize, the limita
tions of. life, even if.it be vuz an hour.
, Responsive to this' kindly human Impulse,
our order to-day bids us remember our brother?
whd'are g*iÂ«\ j bldj> us give them, at least this
little.:, pitiful meed.- remembrance. -We were
partners:ln their endeavor, in their griefs and
Joys." in their fraternal helpfulness: : They were
part's of our lives, and they are gone and will
be w^th us : no. more, 'except as we remember
them. They were our friends and brothera.'
and it iistmeet ' that we * should honor ' their
memories.. .

ROME, \ Oct. B.â "ily eyes have
brought back with them from the
scene of the earthquake a vision of
horror and suffering such as no. imagi
nation could conceive, no peri describe,"
said King Victor Emmanuel on his se
turn from a visit to the. stricken dis
trict. Italy's King always does the
right thing and does it in the right way.
A less strenuous monarch would have
been content ,wltl> perusing reports of
the disaster by others and while tak
ing: things easy in his palace getting
somebody' to write for him an elo
quent message.describing. his own pro
found grief and ..appealing for assist
ance for the sufferers. Victor Emmanuel
is. not that sort of man. Hemade a
thorough toqr of ! the devastated region
and his presence did much ; to. reassure
the panic-stricken people and stimulate
public efforts for their succor.
His .Majesty did ; not. spare himself.
At Parghelin, despite the entreaties of
somemembers of his suite who were
alarmed for his safety, he insisted on
entering tnÂ© wrecked cathedral, the
walls of which threatened to fall in at
any moment. At Stefanconi'he scram
bled over piles of debris to view the
ruins of another cathedral and the
bodies of those who. had there been
crushed to death, i - -;
The scenes of ruin and desolation can
only: be compared to those produced by
a. bombardment, but in many places the
havoc wrought by the earthquake has
been'.fhr more thorough and complete
than could have been produced by the
inoetV destructive of human agencies.
At Zammaro. for instance, not a house
In. the town remains standing and the
inhabitants are* living. In temporary
camps. The Government Is doing^ Us
( best to grapple with the situation: " Re

YOUTH MEETS
DEATH IN BAY
Young John Wemmer of Oak
land Drowned Wliile Sail
ing on Sloop With Friends
TWO GO OVERBOARD
One Boy Is Rescued, but the
Swift Tide Rip Carries the
Other's Body Toward Sea
John Wemmer, an 18-year-old boy
living at 1766 Fifth "street, Oakland,
was drowned yesterday afternoon In
the bay off the southern point of Angel
Island. Wemmer, with nine other boys
of his own age, was sailing in the 38
foot sloop Fawn. , When â¢ oft: ; Angel
Island a sudden gust of wind threw
the heavy boom across the craft. Wem
mer and Harry Spear, ': of 1816 Fifth
street, West Oakland.' .â¢ were brushed
into the water. Harry Duphie, the youth
at the wheel; Jumped Into the little
dory towed by the sloop. He out loose
and reached Spear, dragging him. from
the water. By the time he turned his
efforts to Wemmer the unfortunate lad,
who could not swim, was sinking for
the last time. Duphie made a desperate
effort to reach the drowning boy. in
time, but was unsuccessful.
The accident was the unfortunate
culmination of, what had been an en
joyable outing. Whether the sudden
lurch given' by the sloop, coupled with
the swinging of the boom, was caused
by the poor yachtsmanship of Duphie
at the helm, could not be learned from
any of the ypuths on board. After a
vain search for the body of young
Wemmer the boys sailed back to the
boat's moorings near the Union Works
and notified the Harbor Police of the
drowning.
UOOM SWINGS OVER.
Sail was set bif 10 o'clock yesterday
morning. All the boys, excepting Wem
mer, are employed at the Union Works.
Besides Wemmer and Spear there were
William McKarley, 916 Pine street, Oak
land; Manuel Alameda, 1871 Fifth street,
West Oakland; Dennis Nolan, 113 Chase
street, West Oakland; Harry O'Leary,
Eighteenth and Tennessee streets, San
Francisco; .Edward McKarley, 1601 A
Twentieth street, San . Francisco;
Charles Anderson, 1011 : Pine â¢ street,
West Oakland; John Silver, 920 Pine
street, West Oakland, and Harry
Duphie, 374 Connecticut street. The
youths had planned for a* gala time
and all went well until Duphie at
tempted to bring about the boat on" a
tack near Angel Island. The boys were
sprawled about the deck. Suddenly a
gust of wind drove the boom hard over.
Before a warning could be sounded
Spear and Wemmer were knocked Into
the bay. Spear was rescued, but Wemmer
seemed to have received a stunning
Mow of the boom. He was seen to
struggle feebly for a few moments.
Then, with \ a cry of anguish, the
drowning lad threw up his hands and
disappeared beneath the surface, be
fore Duphie, who was making a hard
effort, could reach him.
BOYS NOTIFY POLICE.
The boys revived Spear and made an
effort to locate the body of their un
fortunate companion, but' were unsuc
cessful. Home was made for, the dark
ness of sorrow chilling every heart
aboard. Each youth' held, himself seme
what culpable for the loss of his
friend's life, even though every attempt
to save Wemmer had been made.
As soon as home was made the boys
went in a body to the Potrero Police
Station and told their story. Duphie
denied that he was in any way to blame
for the sudden lurch of the vessel and
the swinging of the boom. He
avers that everything possible was done
to save Wemmer. He attributes the
accident to a sudden gust- of wind
which threw the ' small craft on her
gunwales.
It Is doubtful If Wemmer's body will
ever be recovered. The tide runs strong
at the point where the accident hap
pened and the body may > even now
be resting far beyond the heads of
Golden Gate.
The drowned boy had been employed
by the California Sash and Door Fac
tory In Oakland and was the son of
John Wemmer, a carpenter.

HEAVES SLANG
AT AUDIENCE
Bert Leslie in a Rapid-Fire
Act Is Favorite of the
Fine Bill at the Orpheuni
SULTAN OF SULU A HIT
George Ade's Musical Com
edy Delights the :; Large
Audience at the Grand
To those interested In up-to-date, rapid
fire slang In its appropriate, settings, a
visit to the Orpheum will prove a genuine
ly funny j treat. Bert Leslie distributes j a
quantity of slang that would make Chlm
mie Fadden green with envy, and to use
Mr. Leslies- own words would drive him
"under j the * wash tubs : with . the rest of
the pipes." -From' start to finish there is
not a dull moment; and from the time
he makes his first entrance until he wad
dles oft the stage-as a murdered Desde-;
mona in a Hooliganesque makeup the
audience is in a state of perpetual hilar
ity. With Mr. Leslie in ' the sketch: are
Mlfs Maud Emery as the tough;' girl,
Robert Dailey as the doctor and William
51 o wry as John.
Second only to Leslie in 'the' number
of laughs but In a class by -himself as
a comedian, is the expressive and droll
Franz Ebert. His portrayal of -the Mes
senger Boy No. 13 is very funny and the
drollness is accentuated by a slight Ger
man accent, to the Bowery dialect This
is Ebert' s second week.
Very clever is Arthur Prince as a ven
triloquist, the transition and inflections
cf his voice making it almost Impossible
to detect the dual role of .the speaker.
Another new act is that -of | Browning
and Wally on the high trapeze â¢ and
feats of strength. â¢
Of the old : bills, : the Melandl' trio of
street: singers take the popular fancy
and their fine -work as musicians' excuses
the senseless buffoonery that 1 mars their
act Carleton Macy and Maude Hall con
tinue to please, in their one act comedy,
while Hall Merritt 1 is a better monologrlst
than he is cartoonist. _
Hall to the Sultan of Sulu! Long may
he live! He is a widly impossible char
acter and his troubles are a mase of ab
surdities, but about him ". there Is an air
of irresistible charm and he. is so shrlek
lngly funny in his every action that you
love and honor him for the . real old
heathen potentate he seems to be. .His
smile is Infectious. He does a thousand
ridiculous things and you laugh, at each
movement of his grotesque body and try
hard to control your mirth until you see
that your neighbor is ' having the same
brand of hysterics that is troubling you
and (hen you don't care,- but go ahead
and give yourself to paroxylsms of Joy.
"The Sultan of Sulu" Is a delicately pre
pared mixture of delightful music, beauti
ful scenes In dreamy . tropic -islands,
dainty girls and \ remarkably, clever dia
logue. A little plot is thrown in to give
the thing a good flavor ana the produc
tion is complete. You like it all because
It Is light enough for you to enjoy with
out having to sit and, think. . Tho situa
tions are surprisingâ to attempt to
describe them Is Impossible. 'The Sultan
has eight ;" wives,, is dethroned and di
vorced.^ by American invaders, pines in a
prison because he falls to â¢ pay the allr
mony and finally is triumphant. as .the
monarch 1 :' of all. . He assimilates with
civilization and the cocktail and feels
for the first' time In his life'.' "such' a head
the next morning." j "Remorse," Js his
pathetic > song then and .It is ' even too
realistic, to many of the audience _ to en
joy. The parts are' all well taken, Al
bert Mahar as the Sultan and Miss Nich
ols* as,Chiqulta, one wife of eight, being
the chief , stars.' :." i ; *'"":\u25a0\u25a0"\u25a0
* ,"The: Sultan 'of .Sulu" opened to a
crowded house 'at the Grand Opera-house
last night. It will continue all the week.
,E. F. Glickman and. his company of
favorite Yiddish players open their reg
ular season at the Alhambra Theater
to-night in a big production of that
well known comedy, with music, en
titled "The Two Kunl Lemels," with
Mr. Glickman and : Mr. Schoenholtz in

A GOOD TEST OF BUSINESS CONDITIONS.
THE business stability of the country was given an excellent
test last week, and it made a fine showing under it. Owing^to
a number of causes, such as large calls upon New for
money wherewith to move the Western crops, preparations to meet
the payment of the last installment^ the Japanese loan, intimations
from Washington that plans were being formed for an issue of Man
ama Canal bonds, etc., the money market did some ground and lofty
tumbling. On Friday call loans opened at 6}i per cent, advanced
to 7y 2 , fell back like a plummet to 1 and finally closed at 2 per cent,
the ruling rate for the day being 7 per cent. Everybody at once
looked toward the stock market to observe the effect of this unusual
fluctuation, but there was none. The market neither went up nor
down, but remained as serene as a mill pond.
There is only one conclusion to be drawn from this apparent
indifference of stocks to sharp advances and declines in money rates,
and that is that powerful interests are behind and 'under stocks,
supporting them against all adverse influences. By all precedent
and the law of cause and effect, stocks ought to go down when
money goes up sharply,. and when it makes no movement the reason
is plain. The stocks are held by strong financial interests, who
bought them when they were lower than at present, and they can.
afford to support them until the bull movement which is predicted,
by the magnates during the winter months gets under way. The
financiers are all bullish over the prospects for trade during the com
ing year and are fortified by the confident predictions of Western
capitalists who are optimistic over the brilliant crop conditions and
arc accordingly continually adding, to their already large stock 1
holdings.
They can see nothing ahead but heavy railroad earnings, full
employment of labor, handsome returns to the farmers, extensive
real estate and building operations and increasing dividends by
standard securities, railroad and industrial. Nor is this all. Look
ing backward they see. that the country's bank clearings for twelve
months ending with September aggregated the enormous and
hitherto unheard-of total # of Â§139,690,000,000', which is 37 per cent
in excess of the preceding year and 21 per cent larger than any pre
vious corresponding period. Then, looking at the current clearings
they see, week after week, the same unvarying gain over the preced
ing year, and it is not surprising that they are sanguine of the
future.
The clearings last week, for instance, were 17 per cent larger
than for- the same week in 1904,' and the aggregate amounted to over
$3,000,000,000, with the great majority of the leading cities and
towns showing marked gains, while the failures for the week were
only 195, against 222 last year. Add to this the current increase in
railway earnings of 7 per cent over 1904, with car shortages report
ed f fom all over the country, and abundant cause for this wide
spread optimism is readily found. Of course, the conditions may
change at any time and in most unexpected ways, but the outlook
is so fine and current conditions so brilliant that the governing
forces of the country's commerce feel justified in expecting a con
tinuation of the present- prosperity.
The staples continue to make their usual gratifying exhibit.
There is some decline in agricultural products due to liberal offer
ings of the new crops, but that always occurs during the fall months,
and is therefore accepted as the regular annual condition. But the
wholesalers and retailers alike are sending in reports of a continued
expansion in. the demand for all sorts of merchandise, with collec
tions good and money in liberal supply and readily accessible. The
industrial interests are making similar reports. The farmers all
over the country, from the wheat grower of the Northwest to the
cotton planter of the South, are in such excellent financial condition
that they are very independent with their produce and are inclined
to be stubborn in their general holding back for better prices later
on. This is particularly observable in the ; great Southern cotton
belt, where the planters are standing together to a man in holding
on to their great staple.
It is an old and trite saying that when the farmer is prosperous
the nation is likewise, but it will bear repetition. Present conditions
are an emphatic illustration of it. Bankers base their plans on- it,
and merchants extend their credits on it. The American farmer
was never in better financial condition, hence prosperity still abides
with the country.
* _ â¢
CONFERENCE OF COLLEGE TRUSTEES.
ANNOUNCEMENT is made from the University of Illinois
that a national conference of trustees of American colleges
and universities will be held at Urbana, Illinois, beginning
Octooer 17, 1905. The sessions are to be held during the week in
which Dr. Edmund J. James will be installed president of the uni
versity. This will give the members' of the conference an oppor
tunity to meet representative men, presidents and professors from
many different institutions.
The foremost question they will try to decide is what should
be the real administrative body of a college or university, the faculty
or the trustees? The system of governing such institutions by
bodies of trustees who are non-experts in educative science is pe
culiar to America, and authorities differ as to whether it is a, satis
factory plan or whether it is the cause of some of the most serious
weaknesses of our system of higher education. In England the old
universities are controlled by the faculties, and in France and Ger
many, while directly under the control of the Governments, they are
ruled by the faculties.
-If the main question were decided in favor of, continuing, the
American custom of governing by trustees who are laymen, then
would follow a number of other problems as to the extent and
method of the control by trustees. Such as: Should the president
of the institution be the sole advisory authority to the board of trus
tees, or should the other administrative officers, or the various facul
ties, be consulted; how should the be selected; should the
trustees take entire control of the finances, or should the faculties
submit a budget; should the alumni have aformally recognized place
in the government ; should the student body take part in the scheme
of government; and is it possible to arrange some uniform method
of bookkeeping and statistics that would make comparisons of "dif
ferent usages more valuables
; Much profitable suggestion will no doubt come from . the dis
cussion of these^ questions and the comparisons of experience; and,
aside from the making manifest of the best methods, it will be well
worth while to form some Â« general systems that will be approved
by collective wisdom and can hereafter be appealed to as prece
dents. Anything recognized as a generally approved plan might
often save much hesitation, uncertainty, friction and- possible ill
feeling as to the extent and limitations of authority. It-Will, be -hard,
however, to form rigid rules, for so much depends on tlie personal
equation that a plan which would safeguard one institution, might
thwart the progress of another. . - la^' : . ; .; ; ;

HEART TO HEART TALK . WITII
AMIXIDAB.
There isja popular impression, Amlni
dab, that energy and persistence are the
main spokes in the wheel of man's suc
cess. Far be it from me to put- a brake
on this- popular Impression, and yet do
you not "suppose that the value of these
qualities* must; depend- more or less on
their : application? When energy Is - mis T
directed, of what earthly use is it? And
when one persists unto a bad end wherein
is the benefit? 1 1 have known energetic
men who might better for the world
have been vacillating- incompetentsâ and
who has not? *
Once I knew a man wno devoted an
almost tireless' energy to attempting to
'solve puzzles. Some publication would
come out with some such" problem as
this: If a man and a half can drive a
pig and a half a mile and a half back
wards In an hour \u25a0 and a half, how ' long
would it take two ' donkeys 'to bray the
"Miserere" if they are not interrupted?
Then that man would take three or four
quires of paper and a pencil or two and
would work on that -problem hour after
hour, and when he got done he had an
answer, but Sir Isaac Newton could not
have told what It was. .
" Now what good, did that man's energy
and persistence do- anybody? He' had
those qualities undoubtedly,' but who
was the better for them? A mute la per
sistent, but men do: not rise up and call
it blessed on that account. No, Amini
dab, energy and persistence, are , not
everything. They need a little plain
horse-sense more or less successfully
combined ' with them. .

TRUTHFUL TALE OF THREE FISHERMEN
{{\/SS. gentlemen. I saw the j
V speckled beauty conic drifting
* lazily down stream. . for the
water was clear as crystal," began the
First Fisherman. "Gently I shoved
\u25a0out a gaudy fly right in his path and j
was rewarded with the -trout stopping
4n his serene course to give It a look.
Still he only nosed around it like an
epicure. .. !
"Just as I was about to lay down the
rod in disgust the water began to fair
ly i boll and when the rod was almost
Jerked out of my listless hands Iknew
that I had hooked that rogue trout.
The /struggle was a fierce one. but
finally I drew the finny fighter wig
gliog above the water â tail first! Then
I realized that I had hooked him by
the tail. -
"Gentlemen, the delicate membranes
at the end of that trout's tall were in
closed in a plain gold ring that I had
lost ten years before while swimming
in that same", stream. A malformation >
had resulted which covered the ring in
parts, but enough ' of the metal was ]
exposed to allow me to recognize it
and to realize how my hook had caught
In it. What, d'ye think of that?"
"Well, well, well, that certainly was
wonderful," said the /second angler, ex
changing sympathetic glances with the
third, whose face had n6w assumed .a
look of settled melancholy.' "The ring
must- be a , great curiosity and I sup
pose you have .it with you."
"The reason I haven't got that ring
to show," explained the FirÂ»t Fisher
man, "Is" because I believe and prac
tice the ethics of true sportr When I
saw that ring tailed trout " gasping
there the thought suddenly came to mt
that the trout hadn't had a fair deal
at all. He hadn't bit at my. hook, so I
threw him back in the stream for 8> a
fairer, chance, but he got "out of reach
mighty^ quickly"â -\u0084-.: ... \u25a0\u0084 .â¢\u25a0 Uv'

"I love you so much," he icplied, "that
in view of my own shortenings, In view
of the uncertainty of ! life, of ; my income

of a child. He isâ to sum it up justly
an honest man. He will never be made

chooses to pursue, you may be sure that
he will move straight toward it.
"Moreover, he is clear-sighted, without

their underhanded ways. â¢ And yet. seeing
things as they are, he believes in the ulti

equal to the greatest fatigue, inured to
hard privation, is at his service, like a
good steed perfectly responsive to its

J. R KNOWLAMD IS TO LECTURE
UY LAURA BRIDE POWERS.
The Daughters of California Pioneers,
Mrs. Sidney Smith Palmer president,
has come to the front to make good
their claim of pride in the State's land
marks.
They, as others, have often expressed
their love of the State's" heirlooms, and
their appreciation of them as assets of
the State, ar.d as object-lessons for Ju
venile patriotism.
But here Is wliore the Daughters differ
from many other peopleâ they desire to
prove it by helping to safeguard the
landmarks now being saved by the Land
marks League. And this is how they pro
pose to do It: On October 24 the Daugh
tersâwho, by the way, object to being
called "Pioneer Daughters" because, well,
because they're not old enough to beâ
will give a "Landmarks Night" at Pio
i^er Hall, the whole_ floor (.save the office)
being graciously turned over by the Pio
neers to the Daughters for their fete.
To begin with, Congressman Joseph R.
Knowland, president of the Landmarks
League, â¢will lecture upon "California
Landmarks and Their History," showing
some hundreds of plates illustrative of
themâ which of itself should fill the hall.
Here It might not be amiss to say that an
intelligent hearing of the lecture might
have a Quickening effect upon the pa
triotism of some excellent but badly in
formed Califorians.
Then, besides the lecture, there will be
a card game going on in the reception
room all evening for such as are devotees
of the deuce.
And, besides, there will be dancing
after the lecture, and a cozy little smok
ing corner for the men who neither dance
nor play cards, but who love a good
smokeâ and the smokes will be good.
Now, all thisâ everything except the
cigars and the punch you buyâ will cost
but 50 cents, the admission price at the
door. Not another cent of tax will be
levied after a man has run the gauntlet
at the door.
Besides, Miss Hilke has consented to
sing, the young musician . who has re
cently returned from New York, where
fhe has achieved great distinction.
yf Tickets for the Landmarks Night are
on ealÂ« at Sherman &. Clay's, and many
are in the hands of Mrs. S. S. Palmer and
members of the organisation. They will
also be on sale on the night of the 24th at
the hail, so don't worry about not being
able to get tickets. Just bring along your
atj cents and you shall contribute that to
the cause and incidently have a beauti
fu' time, if you know how.
-viid meanwhile, let me say that unless
San Franciscans come to the front with
funds before the winter rains set in.
tome of the most valuable landmarks in
the State will have perishedâ notably
the beautiful old Mission -San Antonio.de
Parna, established in 177 L
And i)ear in mind, it is a matter of
Now. or Never. The safeguarding must
be done now, if the Donor of California
is to be savedâ and not only her honor,
but one of her most valuable commercial
assets as well.
Will you hejp?"
Then check off on your "memo" the
nicht of the 24th as "Landmarks Night"
at Pioneer Hall, as guests of the D. of C.
P. ; Congressman lynowland's lecture
alone is worth the price of admission.
But behold, all the fun there shall be
besides !
â¢ â¢ â¢
To-morrow the Mille Club, Mrs. Hen
rietta Casebolt president, will meet at
Sorosis Hall. 1620 California street.
The afternoon will be essentially a Cal
if orna day, the talk being upon "Mis
sion Doloresâ Its Rise and Fall." The
talk is especially apropos, as the 129 th
birthday of the Mission occurs to-day.
. Spanish music will be given, to bear out
the scheme of the dulcet daya of pas
toral California, when the land o'erflowed

The most important affair ahead of the
progressive women of the city Is the
California Equal Suffrage Convention.* to
convene in. Century Hall, October 20 and
2L
Meanwhile the Equal Suffrage League
has adopted the following line of proced
ure in its work of evangelizing: "It will
aid the State association in its work for
an amendment to be introduced in the
next Legislature. It will inaugurate an
active campaign in this city for municipal
suffrage. It will organize precinct clubs
all over the city. It will send to every
woman's club a request that suffrage be
presented or debated on one club pro
gramme during the year. It will offer
to every convention meeting in San Fran
cisco a resolution indorsing political
equality. It will have a speaker in readi
ness to appear upon request before any
organized body, and it will employ an or
ganizer."
Now, that looks as though the league
were going to put up a good fight. But
if it hopes for success, let the organizers
and the primary workers be feminine
womenâ the other kind damages the
cause. One of the reasons advanced
against equal suffrageâ lame though it
heâ ls that "going into politics" will un

wIU be lost, as the bloom wears off the
peach. Now. even dunces who reason
thus have the privilege of deciding the
matter for us, so let the league offset
any such argument by sending out fem

And success to them! and light to the

justice of the demand of "equal rights to

Quite tiie most alluring programme of
the coming week In . clubdomâ and I am
sure the women' who hear it will bear me
out â is the talk at- the Forum Club on
Wednesday by General Woodruff, U. S.
A., upon "Some Military Lessons of the
War In the Orient."
General Woodruff is without question,
one of- the most finished after-dinner
speakers In Californiaâ lt .was after din
ner that I heard him; but I can see no
good reason why he should not be
equally charming before dinner, plati
tudes .to the contrary.

The Sketch Club will hold a meeting on
Thursday next In the new California Club,
building, 1750 Clay street, near Van Ness
avenue, when a lecture will be given
along the lines of Japanese art.
The change of meeting day from the
second Friday to the second Thursday
was made at the request of a majority of
the club.
When the club is located ~ln its new
quartersâ which are being finished to suit
demandsâ no club in the city will be more
suitably situated.
The dramatic section of the California
Club gave two hours to discussing Ber
nard Shaw's "Superman" last Thursday
afternoon. Mrs. J. W. Orr read a paper
In which she out-Shaw'd Shaw and kept
her hearers in a gale of laughter. Miss
Ruth Allen and . Mrs. j Maddern gave a
reading from the love passages between
Anne and John Tanner, bringing out the
delicious comedy of the lines and situa
tionsâthat of a strong, big man running
away from a small bit of femininity. In
the general discussion that followed Dr.
Dorothea Moore gave a very lurid talk on
the central idea on which the comedy is
founded. Mrs. Maddern's analysis In
cluded the box office side as well as the
artistic merits of the play and was
charmingly given.
The first Thursday of next month Mae
terlinck's "Mona Vanna" will be dis
cussed, Mme. Tojetti and Mrs. James
Crawford leading the discussion, while
two well-known artists will give the dra
matic reading.

CLEVELAND, Ohio.. Oct. 8: â In his
closing talk to the Sunday-school
class of the Euclid-avenue Baptist
Church, of which he is superintendent,
John D. Rockefeller to-day made a
comparison of the crops that grow in
the field and the crops that may be
cultivated by each person that will be.
of more benefit than those which grow
in the ground. Rockefeller referred to
personal virtue and in part he said:
I don't know how many of you children have,
been in the country this year, but many of you
have come to see me at tny home and have
made me happy. I want to ask you what
crops you have harvested this year. I won't
find fault If you have am none very well, nor,
if you have forgotten, for we older ones do"
the same thing, but struggle along again and
resolve to do better.,
i I - want to suggest to you children . that you
foster the spirit that prompts ils to speak, a'
kindly word and extend the hand heartily.'
Some of us have not had much education, some .
of us have never graduated from colleges, but;
we can raise crope just the same. Let us cul
tivate the spirit of patience, let us cultivate
that crop right, here in our own. city. In New
York, or wherever we may bel Another crop
ttai we can cultivate is charity. Still another
crop that we can raise is that of good will.
I 'alienee, charity and good will toward others
are ever so much better for ourselves and for
others than are the material j crops that grow
out of the ground. , v
I feel like a sponge because I have absorbed
co many blessings during my stay in the city,
but I remind you that we should be like the
pump, which not only Bucks up, but also gives '
out. If you will cultivate ihe virtues that I
have mentioned you can make a heaven on
earth for yourselves and for all those with
whom you associate. -
'"'To-day was Rockefeller's last day as
superintendent of the Sunday-school
class, of which he has had charge dur- :
ing the .summer.. He will t r^turn to

BRIGHT PROSPECTS

Republican and Democratic county

yesterday to arrange for campaign
meetings in support of the fusion'
ticket. To-day at 636 Market street
committeemen of the Twenty-eighth. 1
Thirty-fourth and Forty-fifth Assem
bly districis will meet. Convenient
headquarters in each .district will be
established this week. *â¢ , -
The executive j campaign committee
of the fusion forcesâ Daniel A. Ryan,
chairman; Thomas W. \l Hickey, vice
chairman, and Louis Slop's, chairman of
the finance committeeâ will hold a
meeting at general headquarters, 636
Market street, this afternoon. â¢ "Ar
rangements for the great ratification
meeting at the Alhambra Theater to
morrow night are very nearly .com
plete. Albert Johnson, whose oratory
in the Democratic .convention excited
unusual interest, will speak ,In sup
port of the fusion nominees in gen
eral and the candidacy" of John S. Part
ridge in particular. The honor af pre
siding ha,? been accorded to Joseph S.
Tobin.
Incidents of the present campaign
signify that Ruef and Schmitz will, not
have a walkover south of Market
street. There will be very nearly an
even break between Partridge and
Schmitz in the Twenty-eighth District
In the election two years ago Schmitz's
plurality in the district approximated
700 Lane got 600 votes and Crocker
about the same number, while Schmitz
received 1350. Now It appears that
Partridge will get as many .votes in
the Twenty-eighth aft both Crocker and
Lane ' received, hence ; Schmitz's major
ity will be reduced to 160 in that south
of Market street district. -The same
rule will apply to â¢ the Twenty-ninth/
Thirtieth, - Thirty-first. Thirty-second
and Thirty-third districts.^ There is no
wonder that Ruef went to extreme and
desperate measures in an . ' effort ; to
block a fusion of the two great parties.

San Erancisco Fleet; Takes
Trip to McNears Landing

GALM, SMOOTH WATEU
Big Crowd of Corinthians
Drops y Anchor at Point
Pablo After Jolly Spin
A large number of yachtsmen were out
on the bay yesterday taking advantage of
the strong northerly breeze and the
smooth water. The San Francisco Yacht
Club fleet cruised up to McNears Land
ing on Saturday afternoon, the flagship
Challenger being followed by the sloops
Curlew, Queen, Annie, Surprise, Amigo,
Thetis and White Heather and the yawls
Tramontana, Royal, Jester and Witch. A
heavy, ground swell and the strong north
er, rendered the night a somewhat restless
one for many of the yachtsmen. An early
start for home was made yesterday morn
ing â¢on the ebb : tide, and moorings were
reached about 2 p. m.
The yachts which had not started out
on Saturday went out for a sail yester
day, some of them trying to reach the
upper bay and others cruising over to the
city front. Among these i, were the sloops
Mlnnetonka, Ariel, Merope. Juanita and
Sappho and the schooners Chispa and
Martha." F.- A. Hyde's motor-boat Olive
was also out with a party. The breeze
was strong and steady till about 3 o'clock
in the afternoon, when it lightened, fresh
ening again later. The whole fleet except
the \u25a0 stoop â¢ Ariel reached moorings before
5 V o'clock and the sloop about an hour
later. The steam yacht iucero was under
way.
A large fleet of Corinthian yachts fol
lowed the flagship to Pablo Point on Sat
urday, returning to Tibufon Cove yester
day.
Several California Club yachts cruised
outside the heads, coming home on the
flood tide.

CARTON READY

Former Partner of Erohman
Appears to Be ou the Eve .
of His -'\u25a0'Old-Time- Success
MA JOB A 'PLATWKIGHT
Brother of Captain Marshall
Tries His Hand at Comic
Opera for London Stage
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Oct. B.â lf R. C Cartons
new play. "Public Opinion," which is
now in active rehearsal at ,Wyndham'Â«,
should prove a success, Charles Froh
man will have reason for some little*
chagrin. Frohman and the author of
"Liberty Hall" parted company last year,
and one Infers it was at the wish of thÂ«
former, the last three plays by Carton
which the American manager produced
having proved gloomy failures. ,-~JjL
It looked as if the, hand that gave d*
"Lord and Lady Algy." "Wheels Within /
Wheels," "The Tree of Knowledge" and
"Lady Huntworth's Experiment" had
lost its cunning, for "A Clean Slate"
was even less successful than its pre
decessor "The Undercurrent" had been,
while the fate of "The Kich Mrs. Rep
ton", was still more unhappy. All three
pieces were given on both sides of the
Atlantic by Frohman, whose relations
with Carton began with the production
of "Lady Huntworth's Experiment."
So their relations were broken off. and
Carton's next play, "Mr. Hopkinson,"
was put on by Frohman's young Eng
lish rival, . Frank Curzon, and proved
about as big a success as the dramatist
ever has had. With James Welch to play
the little bounder, who Is its hero, th*
comedy ran for 200 nights at Wyndham"*.
and is now playing to big Duslness la th*
provinces.
Carton's ne.w play, "Public Opinion,"
Is 'also being produced by Curzon. It is
described -as in the dramatist's lightest
vein, and if it should prove that Carton
has got back Into his stride again his
late- manager will have good reason 'to
wish he had kept on a while linger.
AN' OTHEK MARSHALL WRITES.
An Interesting ree'erit announcement 1Â»
to the effect that Captain Robert Mar
shall's elder brother has followed his ex
ample and tried his hand at play writ ins.
Stephen Marshall, like the author of "A
Royal Family." "Ills Excellency the Gov
ernor" and "The Duke ot KlillerankJ*/"
Is a military man and has the title of .
major. His maiden dramatic effort is
comic opera, for which Ivan Caryll, whosfÂ«
successful scurfs are too numerous to
mtntion. is composing the music. It may
be called "A Lady of Quality," thougli
the title has been used already. Caryll
describes ' Major Marshall's work as a
patch-and-powder opera comique. dated
1719, and not unlike "La Cigale." Inci
dentally the musician Is enthusiastic over.
the Quality, of his librettist.
"He has all his brother's exquisite lit
erary sense," says Caryll. "both in bis
book and verses." If that is true. Major
Marshall should not experience much dif
ficulty in getting it produced, for few
dramatists of recent years have pleased
the public oftener than the ingenious au
thor of "The Second in Command."
London's rather unfavorable verdict on
"The Prince of Pilsen" has been reversed
by ! audiences in .the provinces. In fact
this American musical comedy is reported
to have scored one of the biggest road
successes 'of the present year. At Ports
mouth, the piece. whic><. had a much
shorter run than it deserved at the Lon
don Shaftesbury, was played during the
"Entente" week, and did record business.
This week it is pleasing audiences at th*
Marlborough Theater. Holloway,
there ought to be some pleasing English*
royalties coming to Messrs. Luders and
Pixley.
.\E\V PLAY BY D.WIES.
Weedon Grossmlth. who, like William
Gillette, appears in his own plays, setma
to have the knack of pleasing audiences,
though the critics do not generally care
much for his pieces. For example, "ThÂ»^.
Night of the Party" got only modera^^
praise from the reviewers, but it ran l 3oO'
nights cr .more at the Avenue, and then
enjoyed favor in America. "The Duffer,"
Grossmlth's new play, which is all about
art students, also received severe, han
dling when produced at the Comedy a few
weeks ago, and looked like a flash In the.
pan. but it has run out Us term In Panton
street, and next week Is to be. trans
ferred to the Savoy, which Grossmlth has
been encouraged to lease until the end of
December. He has to quit the. Comedy
because it Is wanted for Willieâ ln Lon
don,* "William"â Collier's appearances -In
"On the Quiet."
Hubert Henry Da vies, thÂ© "youngest
playwright." who has been silent since h*
scored so heavily with "Cousin Kate" and
"Mrs. Gorringe's Necklace." has now fin
ished a new play. It will be done In Lon
don by. Sir Charles Wyndham.
. The management of the Court Theater,
Sloane Square, which, has been giving Ber
nard 1 Shaw for some time. Is
planning to . stage a dramatic version of
Maurice Hewlett's "Pan and the Younj
Shepherd."

"Kitty" Brashear's good right wing was
as true as true blue yesterday when he
whipped Joe Nealori out at the plate and
thusS*", saved the Angels the trouble of
playing O H a tie at the end of the ninth
Epasm. . Joe Nealcn was on second when
Householder swung through to center
with a crashing single. Brashear picked
up the ba!l and whipped it to the plate
In time to allpw; Eagar to touch Nealon
half a second before he could place his
foot on the pan.
Sensational as the llnal inning was, it
did not outdo the previous round in the
matter of nreworks. The Seals were ap
parently beaten when they cajne up for
their licks in the eighth. The Angels
v. ere leading 4 to 1 and the game looked
lv. '
But the Seals pulled oft* a rally that was
c heart-rending affair. Hildebrand opened
it up with a double to right, and Nealon
came along' 'with a single. Householder
alsol responded and Hilde hied himself
home. Irwln showed the true spirit by
chopping off another, filling up the bags.
Wilson dJed by the foul route, but Goch
r.au'-r flattened cue of Nagle's . twisters
lor a safe one. making the score 3 to 2.
There were still three on the bags when
}liit fanned and Spencer lined one at
Dillon, which the big fellow hooked with
one mitt- The Seals managed to nego
tiate five sclid blngles in that memorable
pÂ«-ri;Â¥i, yet the be*t they got was two
runs. Young Nagle was as lucky as ever
and his horseshoe stuck in his hour of
Â»c*jV He ..was steady throughout and
IoW-seA to get out of seme tight places
by*Â« lever headwork and good fielding.
The Angels were outhit, two to one,
but they madr all their wallops count.
They started with a run in the first.
when Brasheair hit the first ball pitched
for a triple and arrived when Hildebrand
threw it away at third. The Seals also
annexed one on Mchler's double and Na
ples boot of Hiideorand's bunt.
The two teams ran neck and neck till
the Angels pulled away in the fourth.
Smith Einjrled to center, and after Dillon
.buntefl Hitt lost the leather at second on
a wild throw. Cravath was there with a
r.ice Facrifice, and Ross responded with
a cleaii to left; scoring both men. Nagle
arrived in the fifth, when he started it
with a single.-,. advanced on a couple of
outs and came . in. as Smith drove another

NEW YORK, . Oct. .B.â Although there
ls-^ not â¢ a -lot ; of class to the card at
Belmont Park ' to-morrow, the prospect
for good .'sport I- Is .= encouraging, as the
fields are > well balanced . andl nearly all
the horses ,' ; en gaged 'have.* been out

the Meadowbrook Steeplechase are the
features."; . ; ,. : '
At the .weights Pure: Pepper I6oks
best. in the Meadowbrook Steeplechase.'
The las^.time he met Otho; Vaugh he
attempted to present the latter with
thirty-one pouTids and found it'impos
sible. To-morrow he has only to give
eight pounds.
Although King Pepper ' may, \u25a0 not
have a great deal" of -class, 'It
is wonderful to see how the old. horse
keeps poking his nose in front of good
ones. There is lots of speed In the
Westchester Handicap, . but -at ninety
flve pounds King Pepper will always
be well up, providing he gets away
from the post in good shape. Ginriette is
a very speedy ; mare," but this distance
does not suit 'her as well as .a mile,
as she is rather a slow beginner. ;
Oxford is able -to show, his real form
every now and again,' and this distance
and weight are to his liking. Aeronaut
Is in jgroodt-form, but he will find the
route a"bit far f6r him. Jacauln did
not show a great deal of speed in his
last race, and it was thought by those
who should have known of his condi
tion that, he would have walked" In.'
Race* King, is in good: form .now and
he will be suited by the extra distance.

straight sets last Sunday, fell: an. easy
victim 'to thy* clever "young Herbert

played away below his form of the pre
vious' Sunday. " What was expected to
prove one of the closest matches in the
first round turned out to be a walk
over" for Percy Murdocfc. His opponent,

ThÂ«L,o'nly match of any consequence in

Foley and Adams and Janes. The former
played a steady, consistent game and won
the match .by. a . small margin. Adams

SHIP LEAVES
DOCK TO- DAY
Alaineda Is Temporarily Re
paired and Will Be Towed
to , Pacific-Street Wharf
The damages to the steamer Ala
xneda. have been temporarily re-
Paired and early this morning she will
be floated out from the dry dock at Hunt
ers Point and towed down to her wharf at
Pacific street. The present' repairs to
her hull consist of putting, in temporary
plates over the holes in her bottom. .The
\u25a0work vai done by Moore & Scott.
. As soon" as she is alongside Pacific
street wliarf. the remaining cargo In her
hold will be taken out and when this
work is completed she will be again tak
â¬ii back to the dry dock, where she will
bÂ« put in perfect sea-going shape.
Captain John Metcalfe, Lloyd's marine
fcurv'eyor. said yesterday that from the
survey he made yesterday nntc t thought it
would cost about STS,O(XÂ» to place her In
the same condition she was in at the
time she ran upon the rocks. Besides the
work to the hull and the putting In of
ne w plates to replace those that were
damaged, there will be a. lot of Â« work to
put the engines and boilers In condition.
After "this is all done the* cabins and
staterooms axe to lye. painted and re
decorated. When she uncc again goes
into commission she will be one of -the"
best of the ships in the Pacific trade.
The splendid work done in getting, the
Alameda. away from the rocks was high
ly commented upon yesterday by Alex
ander H. Small, manager or the marine
department of Balfour, Guthrie &. Co.,
who- said:
' ."Too much praise cannot be paid to
Ckptain-Pillsburj- and Captain Metcalfe
\u25a0{or the work they have, done and. the
ability they have shown in pulling the
.stranded; vessel off the rocks. It Is -to
the vast amount of energy dteptayed^by
ihem that she is now afioat. They, did
nothing by piecemeal. â¢â¢â¢ They installed
en the wrecked ship an enormous plant
of pumps and worked â¢ overtime to get
. tht- cargo out sufficiently to float her
w bile the weather still remained calm,
TVlth the breeze blowing and the sea
ewashlng around Tort Point as it is to
day the Alameda would have undoubted
ly been a. great sufferer had she been ly
ing on the rocks and her chance for
being caved would have been remote."
Unldeatlaed Man Expire*.
The unidentified man who was found
in an unconscious condition at Powell
Â»nd: California streets on â¢ Saturday
eight - died at the Central Emergency
Hospital about 3 â¢ o'clock yesterday
morning. His body was removed to
