DENVER, Colo., July 19.â Positive
proof that the train robber who was
killed on Divide Creek June 9 last was
not the notorious bandit, Harvey Lo
gan, has been obtained by an examina
tion of the body. The convincing
mark of identification on which the de
tectives relied was a scar on the right
wrist, caused by a gunshot wound
known to have been inflicted several
years ago. The dead man's wrist bears
no such mark.

Dr. Sylvester J. Byrne, registrar of
vital statistics for Brooklyn, said that
from noon on Monday to the same hour
to-day the department received reports
of eighty deaths. The average for this
time of year is about seventy. Many
of those who died, he said, were chil
dren or aged and weak persons, who
easily succumbed to the extreme heat
In the tenement districts of Manhat
tan many infants were to-night re
ported in a critical condition. Every
living creature in the city suffered.
Scores of horses gave out during the
day and wherever men or women were
required to do any kind of hard labor*
Indoors or out, their suffering was In
tense. At 5 o'clock in the afternoon
the mercury stood at 93 above zero
on the roof of the Weather Bureau, but
down In the street, where the eun was
felt and where breezes did not reach,
it was seven or eight degrees higher.
Uptown at that hour the registered
temperature was an even 100 degrees.
At intervals all day fresh breezes
were wafted through the heated streets
and greatly relieved the severe burn
ing of the sun. The humidity, too,
was - much less than on Monday and
that made the strong heat more en
durable. Thousands swarmed Into the
parks and every spot along the water
front wfiere bathing was permitted was
thronged with men and boys until a
late hour. In all the downtown parks
the police permitted the benches to be
used for beds and hundreds of weary
bodies spent the night there under the
trees.
Hundreds of babies and small chil
dren were taken to the floating and
seaside hospitals for relief. A floating
hospital goes out of the city each day
and to-day there were twice as many
little patients as could find passage.
Every bed at the Seaside Hospital is
occupied.
CHICAGO, June 19.â The hot wave
gave way to cooling breezes to-day.
The temperature averaged 10 degrees
lower than during the past two days.
Moderate summer weather is the fore
cast. . - ,
Reports from the Bureau of Statis
tics to-night showed that in Manhat
tan the number of deaths during the
preceding forty-eight hours was much
larger than the average during the
heated term, while In Brooklyn the
number of deaths more than doubled.
NEW YORK, July 19.â Twelve
deaths, six of which occurred in Brook
lyn, with scores of prostrated persons
taken to hospitals, was the record of
the Intense heat in New Tork City to
day. Hundreds of adults and children,
whose names were not on the records
of the hospitals, were in a critical con
dition, and it is likely that to-morrow's
death list will be much larger than
that of to-day, unless the weather mod
erates.

The Bcale was at first believed to be
a Joke. The miners' officials conferred

Inevitable, an exodus to Christopher,
a small town six miles distant, was be
gun. In one place a new city has been
established. It is composed of tents,
but M. J. Turner has been elected
Mayor and all minor officials have been
sworn In. Here it is that the miners
who are fighting Leiter will make their
campaign headquarters.
The town is only a short distance
from the atocka.de and it is the belief
that the struggle will result In an out
brak In which human life and property
will greatly suffer.
Leiter has constructed one of the
most modern coal shafts in the United
States. His interests are at present
more than a million dollars. Just as
soon as his mine was ready to open,
when he thought that 8000 tons of coal
could be hoisted daily, Leiter issued an
ultimatum to the men which was a
reduction of 18 cents a ton in mining.
Leiter's troubles with the coal min
ers reached its first serious point on
July IS, when 150 strikers and their
families were evicted from their
homes in Zeigler. The men had de
fied the owner of the property and he
in turn declared that he would recog
nize no union rules that interfered
with his own way of conducting his
business.
The stockade, when completed, will
be a formidable affair. It is now near
ly finished and when the last nail is
driven the great fence will be sur
mounted by live electric wires. The
electrical charge in the wires will be
sufficiently strong to stun an ordinary
man, but not strong enough to kill.
CARBONDALE, 111.. July 19. â In
his war with the union miners in his
coal camp at Zeigler, Joseph Leiter
has established what is practically a
principality or feudal estate. Seven
thousand five hundred acres of coal
land are owned there by Leiter and
the entire tract is now being inclosed
by a stockade. No person is permit
ted to enter Zeigler without a permit
from Leiter. and twenty-five telephone
.stations have been established around
I he place. These are in charge of

ST. PETERSBURG, July 20.â As an
outcome of Lieutenant General Count
Keller'B engagement at Motien Pass
the military experts are convinced that
there has been a rearrangement of the
Japanese forces and a change in the
Japanese plans in favor of a flanking
movement on Liaoyang, rather than a
direct movement on Tatchekiao. ; This
change, coinciding with the arrival of
Field Marshal Oyama, leads the ex

gone to Zion City for the purpose of
assigning to John Alexander Dowie,
the .so-called healer, the greater por

.The Misses Elizabeth and Josephine
Ellingson, two society belles, daughters
of the merchant, announced at a house
party on Sunday that, owing to their
father's decision, they will have to re
tire from their social duties and enter
the business world to make a living.
Because of their opposition to their
father's plans, the young women are to
be cut off with an insignificant allow
ance which will not permit them to re
tain their former position in society.
The young ladies have withdrawn from
Drake University and do not expect to
complete their college education.
The Ellingson residence here is val
ued at $16,000 and the entire estate at
$150,000. Ellingson believes it to be his
Christian duty to give his money into
Dowle's hands.

immediate control of the estate, their
application for special letters had the
effect of setting at rest ugly rumors
that were circulated to the effect that

Those who are familiar with the de
tails of the tragedy believe that the
heiress became affected by the intense
heat in New York, and that, unnerved
and depressed since her father's death,
she was suddenly bereft of her reason,
the fatal plunge resulting.
Reaction has followed the shock that
came to the heirs when Miss Dolbeer' s

day these relatives kept close to their
quarters, doubtless pondering. There

serted they will do. The taelra art

But one step was taken In the Dol

in Miss Dolbeer'3 will as executors, ap
plied for special letters of administra

RUMORS SET AT REST.
SELECTS AN* AUTOMOBILE.
Since the tragic passing of her younj:
friend, Miss Warren has suffered a
nervous collapse. In spite of her phy
sician's orders, the young woman who
for seventeen years had filled the
dual role of loving mother and sis
ter t6 the dead girl, insisted upon at
tending the funeral. Returning home,
she was placed under the care of a
trained nurse, who, with a specialist
on nervous diseases, is caring for her.
Yesterday her only visitor was her sis
ter, Miss Fannie Warren, who re
mained with her during the day.
That awful moment in New York Is
burned deep into the brain of Miss
Warren. Her charge had not mani
fested the slightest intention at any
time of terminating her life. In fact,
on the morning of her death Miss Dol
beer accompanied Miss Warren to the
agency for the purchase of their rail
way tickets for the expected trip to
San Francisco, and looked, it i3 said,
into the details of their issuance with
perfect intelligence and mental bal
ance.

fortunate Bertha M. Dolbeer to contest
her last will and testament. Educated
by the lessons of the Fair and

those most interested in Miss Dolbeer'a
estate â Miss Etta Marion Warren and

MAN DROPS DEAD IN A
MARKET-STREET SALOON
A man supposed to be , John P.
Sederborg. a tailor from Fresno,
dropped dead last night from heart
disease In the Defender saloon, 757
Market street.
The body was taken to the Morgue.
In the pockets were found $6 in cash
and nine pawn tickets. These were
for two gold watches, a silver watch,
five rings and a gold quartz chain.
The aggregate sum the owner had re
ceived on the Jewelry was $285.
What Sederborg was doing with all
the jewelry is a mystery. The police
have his picture and believe they may
identify him as a pickpocket.
A bill for woolen goods sold to John

dead man was a tailor in the Raisin

many others she sought refuge behind
a friendly mountain which towers near
Vladivostok.
Mrs. Milne was the only woman pas-
senger on the last train leaving Vladi

communication by rail at that time. *â¢
Mrs. Milne declares that Russia will
eventually win in the present struggle,
but that the Japanese at the present
time are singularly successful. She
avers, however, that the latter are not
winning all the battles reported as be
ing won by them, this being at^
tributable in some degree to the work

OF INTEREST TO PEOPLE
OF THE PACIFIC COAST
Warnings have gone out to shipping
along the eastern coast of Japan and
merchantmen are hurriedly seeking
cover. It is expected that most of the
shipping will be warned before the
Russian vessels can inflict serious dam
age, if a raid is purposed.
Ordinarily a lack of coal would pre
vent an extended cruise, Dut it is pos
sible that the Russians possess a col
lier at a rendezvous in the Pacific
Ocean.
vThe Vladivostok squadron, unaccom
panied by torpedo-boats, entered the
Pacific Ocean to-day at 7 o'clock. Its
destination is unknown, but it is sug
gested that it possibly plans to raid
the east coast of Japan and then either
return to Vladivostok, escape to the
southward or attempt to form a junc
tion with the Port Arthur fleet.
The squadron was discovered in the
Straits of Tsugari at 3 o'clock this
morning steaming rapidly eastward.
At 3:S0 a. m. it was reported, off Tap
pi Cape and at 7 a. m. observers at
Hakodate discerned it and reported to
Tokio that it was then steaming to the
east. â¢
TOKIO, July 20, noon. â The Vladi
vostok squadron has overhauled a
Japanese steamship eastward of Tsu
gari Straits. The name of the vessel
captured and her fate have not yet
been learned.
JAPANESE SHIP CAPTURED.
"Another submarine boat from
America arrived at Kronstadt last
night. The first American submarine,
which arrived about a fortnight ago,
was allowed to drop in landing her
from the vessel which brought her
and was seriously damaged."
LONDON, July 20. â The Standards
St. Petersburg correspondent, cabling
under date of July 19, says:
Second of the Craft Recently Shipped
Reaches Kronstadt.
SUBMARINE BOAT ARRIVES.
Anohter element adding to the dan
gers of the situation is the attitude
Japan may assume. The Pall Mall
Gazette points out that If, as stated
in dispatches from Constantinople, the
Russian guardship Chernomoretz tra
versed the straits fully armed, "it
would: seem to justify Japan in regard
ing Turkey as an ally of Russia and
invoking the terms of the Anglo-Ja
panese treaty.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 19.âGer
many has called attention to the seiz
ure-of the mails on board the Prinz
Heinrich in the Red Sea on July 15 by
the Smolensk and has requested ex
planations. These have not yet been
given; -Jthe report of the commandeV of
the Smolensk not having arrived. The
restoration of the mails yesterday was
made without instructions from St. Pe
tersburg. Russia, having declared
communications intended for the Ja
panese to be contraband of war, main
tains the right to examine such mail,
but does not contend for the right 'to
take such mail addressed to
Japan, and unless peculiar circum
stances Justified the seizure of the
malls .on board the Prinz Heinrich the
act will be disavowed.. Â¦â¢*"
The first impression in diplomatic
circles here that the action of the Rus
sian volunteer fleet vessels in stopping
neutral ships in the Red Sea to search
for contraband of war would not give
rise to complications is being super
seded by the view, which there is good
reason to believe is well founded, that,
instigated by Great Britain, it will at
least lead to an interchange of views
between the powers signatory to the
treaty of Paris regarding the statuB of
the remaining ships of the volunteer
fleet now In the Black Sea. Thus the
old question of the Dardanelles may
again, become the subject of Important
diplomatic communication' : .
The Foreign Office points out that the
diplomatic | situation created by the
seizures is not : adapted for common
treatment by, Germany and England,
since the act â¢ of vessels
toward each country is too dissimilar.
Germany is conducting her case inde
pendently of. Great Britain. The offi
cials say that much ! less excitement
prevails in the country than when
Great Britain seized two! German ves
sels during the Boer .wfir. Neverthe
less, the officials emphasize the state
ment that Germany cannot submit to
Russia's treatment.
LONDON, July 19.â In British circles
the recent seizures and overhauling of
British ships in the Red Sea by the
Russian volunteer fleet steamships
Smolensk and St. Petersburg are re
garded as very grave international in
cidents. The. seizure of the Peninsular
and Oriental steamer Malacca by the
St. Petersburg and her arrival in the
Suez canal as a prize of war, Â¦ on her
way to Libau, on the Baltic, have come
as a climax and the Cabinet to-day
was considering the course to pursue.
The British law officers acknowledge
the right of the Russians to seize and
detain mails, provided that only offi
cial communications are taken, but
they take the most serious view of the
status of the two Russian ships pa
trolling the Red Sea and if any official
action or protest ensues it will be
chiefly in regard to the passage of these
erstwhile merchant ships through the
Dardanelles and their subsequent
transformation into ships of war.
In official circles strong comment is
made in regard to Russia's policy. It
is regarded as impossible that the com
manders of the Smolensk and St.
Petersburg were given full-power, and
the officials, therefore, are inclined to
the grave conclusion that the Russian
Government gave Implicit instructions
to the two commanders.
The effect on the stock exchange to
day was seen in a heavy fall in con
sols and other gilt-edged securities, on
fears of international complications.
The dangers and difficulties of the
matter are much commented upon In
the newspapers which are practically
unanimous in denouncing the "dubious
and irregular character" of the volun
teer fleets.
"If their actions are proved, as we
believe, to be those of vulgar filibust
ers," said the St. James Gazette, "they
must be recalled by Russia* or the
skull and cross bones must be run up
and they will be fired upon whenever
sighted." ,
SUEZ, July 19.â The Peninsular^ and
Oriental steamship j Malacca, captured
in the Red Sea, has arrived here flying
the Russian naval flag. She Is now in
command of a Russian naval -officer
and carries, a prize crew from the vol
unteer fleet steamship SL Petersburg.
The Malacca entered the canal to-day
on her way to Libau, on the Baltic.
The company's' agent attempted to
board the vessel, but the Russian com
mander refused "-him admission.
BERLIN, July 19.â Russia has not
yet answered the German protest
against the seizure of the mails of the
Prinz Heinrich by the Smolensk, : but
the Foreign Office confidently expects
a disavowal of the action of the com
mander of the Smolensk.
The Foreign Office informs the press
that the seizure of mails included Eng
lish and Italian sacks. "
SHANGHAI, July 19.â The British
steamship Lienshing, which arrived
here from Weihaiwei to-day, reports
that she was' signaled hy:- the . steam
ship Peiping (owned by \ the Chinese
Engineering and Mining Company of
Shanghai), whose Â¦ commander asked
the Lienshing 'to advise the owners of
the Peiping that the Bhip and cargo
had . been . captured by the Japanese
cruiser Hongkong and that. the vessel
was proceedings to .Japan with a prize
crew on board, v The news of the cap
ture of the Peiping, was communicated
to the British admiral, whose squadron

Assassination Is their Initial policy-
It was begun when Georgian workers
killed Vladeneff, chief of communica
tion In the Caucasus. His murderer
"was never captured. The Circassians
followed with the murder of a chief
of police. They also escaped arrest.
ST. PETERSBURG, July 19. â The
Eviet says the assassination of Vice
Governor Andreiff of Elizabethpol,
rvhich occurred on the evening of the
,17th instant, undoubtedly was due to
a political plot, but whether the crime
was committed by Armenians or an
archists is not clear. So frequent are
*uch crimes becoming that the Svlet
ssks for special measures to prevent
their recurrence.
About two years ago leaders of the
races evolved a plan for co-operation,
including Georgians, Armenians, Cir
cassians and Tartars â the whole revo-
Jutlonary population of the Caucasus,
eome 4,000,000 eouls. Autonomy Is now
the cry of all.
Formerly the St. Petersburg Govern
xnent contrived to keep the Georgians
and the Armenians, who constitute the
greater part of the population of
Transcaucasia, mutually hostile, not
withstanding that they are both Chris
tian peoples and both revolutionary.
The Georgians and the Armenians
have alike maintained liberation move
ments and have had organizations at
home which supported Journals in Ge
neva and Paris, but they have hated
&nd distrusted each other.

TATCHEKIAO, July 19.â Captain
Dashkin, with a company of Cossacks,
struck the Japanese at Tzlnshilinp on
July 16. Unseen, the company occu
pied a peak overlooking the Japanese
camp, from which it drove the Jap
anese with a plunging fire. The Jap
anese lost one officer and many men
were seen to fall. During the retreat
the Japanese were reinforced by two
companies, but these were driven off
by the Russians/who occupied the vil
lage without the loss of a man.
Ambuscades and surprises are of
everyday occurrence. The Russians are
losing no opportunity to worry their
foes. The Japanese seem, to be moving
their forces northeastward in the di
rection of Hiuyan and Slmouchen.
Fresh guns, mules and ammunition are
being brought up dally and sent to
points where the Japanese expect to
give battle. The movement eastward
is much Impeded by Russian attacks.
At Siatzatun and Gaitziatun the
Russian gunners shelled the Japanese
camps and drove out the troops in dis
order. Many were killed or wounded
and large supplies were abandoned.
Another Japanese party was surprised
at Kaimahe and Tunchemain while
marching in the mountain defiles to
join General Nodzu.
The Russians advanced two miles to

Russians. If this story is true, the

China Navigation Company, which
yesterday was forty-eight hours over

A junk with eight Russians and fifty
Chinese on board arrived here this
afternoon, five days from Port Arthur.
The Russians refused to. talk, but the
Chinese say that on July 11 and 12 the
Japanese captured and occupied with
4000 men one of the eastern forts near
Port Arthur. Before reinforcements
arrived the Russians cut off the 4000
troo-ps in the fort and exploded mines
which resulted in the killing of every
Japanese soldier there.

of a reverse which, though not of the

Defense Wants Witnesses
Summoned to Prove That
the Conspiracy Existed
The defense, near the close of the
session, created a sensation by mov
ing to summon Mayor Petkoff of Sofia,
Bulgaria; a former Russian drago
man, Jacobsohn of Rushchuk, Bulga
ria, and the editor of a Sofia newspa
per in order to prove that the Rus
sian Government had been keeping
agents in the Balkans since IStil to
incite the people against their rulers.
The defense wants to prove through
these witnesses the Russians' respon
sibility for the murder of King: Alex
ander of Kervia and Premier Stambou
leff of Bulgaria, from which to draw
the conclusion that Russia is not a
civilized state with a claim for the
protection of the German courts.. The
State's Attorney offered the motion,
but the court took the matter uruler
consideration and adjourned until to
morrow. Another sensation of the
day was a telegram from the Foreign
Office stating that a treaty between
Russia and Germany covering para
graph 260 of the Russian penal code
dees not exist. The paragraph refers
to punishment for high treason
against foreign potentates, which was
shown to apply only where a treaty
explicitly provider for it.
KOENIGSBURG, July ID.â At to
day's session of the court which July
12 began the trial of the seven Social
Democrats accused at the instance of
the Russian Government of smuggling
anarchistic literature into Russia, ths
testimony given shows that some of
the pamphlets in question appealed to
the army, urging the soldiers to make
common cause with the people to dis
obey the command to fire upon . the
populace, to shoot into the air and to
turn their bayonets against the of
ficers.
story is not confirmed. The Admiralty
has no news of any vessel having been
lost at Vladivostok.
Eight companies of Russian infantry
and a body of cavalry attacked the
Japanese position at Chlaton. The Jap
anese there were reinforced by a com
pany of infantry and a company of
engineers, and the Russians were re
pulsed.
In his report on the fighting General
Kuroki says that the Russians number
ed about two divisions, and were form
ed of parts of the Third and Sixth Si
berian Sharpshooters, the Ninth and
another infantry division.
The Japanese lost four officers and
thirty-nine men killed and fifteen offi
cers and 241 men wounded. The cas
ualties all occurred in the Second Di
vision. General Kuroki mentions, but
he does not enumerate, the trophies
captured. He estimates the Russians'
losses as exceeding his own. '
ST. PETERSBURG, July 19.â The
War Office has no further details of
the Russian repulse at Motien Pass.
The lose of men, which it is freely ad
mitted will probably, be considerably
in excess of General Kuropatkin's fjg
ures given out last night, is greatly
deplored. But evidently the engage
ment at least served the purpose of
demonstrating that General Kurokl's
army has been heavily reinforced north
and the general staff is now inclined
to believe that the Japanese command
er may have decided that a frontal at
tack from the south is inadvisable and
Is concentrating his forces for a direct
attack on Liaoyang.
The Russians made vain endeavors
to envelop the Japanese left. At this
point the Japanese occupied the sum
mit of Motien Mountain and they re
sisted desperately the efforts of the
enemy to Mislodge them.
When the Russians finally retreated
they were pursued by the entire Jap
anese line. Seven battalions of the
enemy made a halt on the heights of
Tawan and with four guns checked
the Japanese pursuit.
One company of Japanese soldiers,
reconnoitering from Hslukailing, en
countered and engaged three bat
talions of Rus?|anR. It fought until
reinforced by f^our more, companies,
when the Russians were repulsed.
The Japanese seized and held the
heights east of Makemenza.
The attack on Hsiamatang began at
8 o'clock in the morning. A battalion
of Russian infantry and a. squadron
of cavalry assaulted the, Japanese
company on the outpost there. The
Russians received reinforcements un
til they were a regiment strong. .The
Japanese resisted doggedly. All. their
officers were either killed or wounded,
but still the men fought on. The Jap
anese finally received reinforcements
and the Russians retired at 5 o'clock
In the afternoon.
JAPANESE LOSS IS SMALLu
PURSUE RETREATING FOE.
TOKIO, July 19.â The Russian at
tempt to retake Motien Pass on July
17 was not productive of a general en
gagement, nor was it marked by serious
losses. There were, however, a series
of desperate small encounters. The
Japanese guarded their positions about
the pass with a company on outpost.
These men resisted stubbornly the Rus
sian advance and awaited the arrival
of reinforcements. When- these arrived
they joined in the general attack. The
outpost detachment stationed â¢ - at
Hslamatang held its position all day
long. It was largely outnumbered by
the enemy and every, commissioned and
non-commissioned officer was wounded,
as were a majority of the men...
The attack on Motien Pass began at
S o'clock in the morning. The Rus
sians engaged the outposts and the
Japanese at once Â¦went into action.
The Japanese artillery, posted on the
heights to the northwest of Wuflng
kuan, opened on the enemy and the
Japanese outposts retired gradually.
The Russian cavalry galloped forward
and deployed along the ridge to the
west of the pass. Two hours later, at
5 o'clock,' the entire Japanese line
was engaged. The Russians were con
stantly receiving reinforcements and
finally they had four regiments in ac
tion. They outnumbered the Jap
anese.

Fusan, Monday, July 18.â More Russian
troops were engaged in yesterday'*
battle at Motien Pass than In pre
vious engagements. There were prob
ably double the number of those who
took part in the fight at the Talu River,
while opposed to them were only one
brigade and one battalion of the Jap
anese forces. The Russian loss is esti
mated at 2000. The burial of the dead
continues. The Japanese casualties ag
gregated 300.
The engagement has conspicuously
demonstrated the wonderful efficiency
of the Japanese infantry. They proved
incomparably the better marksmen
and greater in initiative, and they out
fought and outgeneraled the Russian*
on every point.
NEWCHWANO, July 19.â Hard fight

Just before the woman's arrest the

had discovered enough arsenic In it

OYSTER BAY, July 19.â President
Roosevelt to-day received the commit
tee appointed last Sunday by the con
vention of the coal miners and allied
crafts of Wilkesbarre, Pa. The mis
sion of the committee was to present
personally to the President a petition
reciting the conditions in which organ
ized labor has been placed by the ac
tion of the authorities of Colorado and
requesting him to institute .an inves
tlgatjpn of the labor troubles in that
State with a view of remedying the
conditions now existing if possible.
The committee spent a half hour with
the President in his library. The peti
tion, which was the expression of 220,
000 men of the union labor organiza
tions of Northeastern Pennsylvania,
was laid before the President. He read
it carefully and then informed the
committee he would be glad to do any
thing he properly and legally could to
ameliorate the condition existing in the
State of Colorado. He indicated that
an investigation of the labor "troubles
in that State was now being made by
agents of the Department of Com

It now transpires that the cope was

a beautifully embroidered piece of
work, done in France in the thirteenth
century. It was presented to the As

to-day, was asked to become chair

William F. Sheehan is second choice,
but he also mav decline, chiefly be
cause he regards his health as unequal
to the strain. Should Sheehan not ac

uncertain as to who may be chosen.

should be the chairman, preferring to

fused to accent his answer as final.
"I ought not to be asked to assume
the burdens of the chairmanship,"
Senator Gorman said. "I have done
my share for the Democratic party
and you ought to find some one else to
take the place. I know what the de

CAIIFORXIAXS AT THE FAIR.
GUATMAS. Mexico. July 19.â A de
tachment of Mexican regulars reached
here Monday night with twenty-five
Taqui prisoners captured after a hard
fight by Captain Celso Aguilar and two
companies of regulars, returning after
a twenty days' campaign in the Yaqui
country, northwest of Guaymas.
Aguilar was on his way back to San
Jose de Guaymas, believing that he
had rid the country of all the raiding
Indians, when he came upon a band of
fifty-six savages who were in the act
of holding up a big pack train bound
for the San Jose ranch. Aguilar came
upon the Indians without notice and
both parties were taken completely by
surprise. Although the Mexicans out
numbered them, the Indians gave bat
tle, but five of their number were shot
down and many wounded. They at
tempted to flee, but only those who got
off on the pack horses escaped, the
balance being taken prisoners. Aguilar
and his men withdrew to San Jose de
Guaymas after the fight and an escort
was detailed to take the prisoners to
Guaymas for deportation. The Mexi
can detachment reports that none of
their number were killed In the fight,
although some received slight wounds.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
It is explained that these discrepan
cies are due to the demoralized and
incomplete condition of the records in
the office of Grand Secretary Reynolds.
No such explanation is given of the
charges by Grand Treasurer Needs of
extravagance. Needs reports that the
eighty-six district deputies drew
$3039. at the Baltimore reunion last
year, while the standing committees
While the delegates were engaged in
these sessions there was much excite
ment among the visiting Elks over the
exposures in the annual reports about
the alleged extravagance in the ex
penses of certain general officers and
the discrepancies between the different
reports.
SECRETARY IS CRITICIZED.
While the eighteenth annual reunion
of the Benevolent and Protective Or
der of Elks has been in progress all
this week, the fortieth meeting of the
Grand Lodge did not begin until to
day, when morning, afternoon and
night sessions were held.
There were but two candidates for
grand exalted ruler. The ballot re
sulted as follows: W. J. O'Brien of
Baltimore, 710; Samuel H. Needs of
Cleveland. 379.
When the nominations were alt made
a recess was taken from 7 o'clock until
9 o'clock for the purpose of having all
the nominations printed on Australian
ballots.
CINCINNATI, July 19.â An unknown
woman was attacked by a maddened
bear In charge of the Huntington (W.
Va.) Elks, on Central avenue here to
day. Before the animal could be re
captured it had torn the garments of
the woman Into shreds, partially dis
robing her.
There were two bears with the party
that came on a special train from Hin
ton, Charleston and Huntington, W.
Va. The animal which caused the mis
chief was in charge of George Garred,
trustee of the Huntington lodge. It is
said that on the way to Cincinnati the
animal3 were treated to beer, which
caused them to become wild. The
crowds at the depot and the heat
helped to make their condition worse.
While on the way to the Grand Hotel,
the bear In charge of Garred broke
loose and attacked a woman who was
standing on the curbstone watching
the incoming visitors. The animal
clawed at her dress and soon had the
silken folds in shreds. She saved her
face from being disfigured by dodging.
Elks surrounded the bear and tore It
from its intended victim.
Meanwhile the other bear. In charge
of an Elk from Hinton, also broke
loose, tore through the crowd and ran
for several squares before it was cap
tured.
EXALTED RULER. ELECTED.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Events in the south signify that the
Senatorial alignment may be Bard and
anti-Bard. In the Eighth Congression

ties of San Luis Obispo, Santa Bar

Bernardino, Orange, Riverside and San
Diego. S. C. Smith of Kern Is an active
candidate for the Republican Congres
sional nomination and his supporter*
eeem to be lending their aid to pro
mote Bard's re-election to the Senate.
Advantages already gained by Bard In
Riverside. Orange and Kern counties
arid the complete confidence of Sena
tors Rowell, Flint and Bulla that Bard
will win in Santa Barbara and Ven
tura counties have created some com
motion in political circles.
The ar.ti-Bard forces :n San Fran
cisco regard the introduction of Frank
P. Flint's candidacy as detrimental to
Oxnard. They hoped and believed that
Oxnard would win in a rair and open
contest against Bard, but are now
afraid that Flint will draw more
strength from Oxnard's column than
from the Bard camp. Btate Senators
Italston and Leavitt are endeavoring
to put George A. Knight to the front
es a candidate in direct opposition to
Bard and the Democratic press Is her
alding reports that President Roose
velt is partial to Knight and hostile to
Bard.
The talk of Presidential preference is
eiry nonser.se. The fact is well known
to many leading Republicans in the
State that the President entertains
high regard for Senator Bard and
Henry T. Oxnard. Perhaps George
Kr.ight and Frank Flint are highly es
teemed by the chief executive. No
doubt the President appreciated
Knight's speech in the Chicago con
vention.
PRESIDENT KNOWS STATE.
All accounts from Washington are to
tne effect that the President is singu
larly well informed concerning personal
ijnd political affairs in California. He
knows who was slated to lead the op
position in California when there was
talk of an opposing candidate for the
Presidential nomination and he knows
that the State Legislature will elect a
Republican United States Senator.
There is not the slightest proof that he
has expressed a preference for or a
word ag-ainst any one of the Republi
can aspirants.
There are no indications that the j
Southern Pacific Company is lending j
its support to any Senatorial aspirant, j
and there is no eign of any purpose on
the part of the corporation to compli- j
cate the political situation by the in- j
troduction of a candidate. The sup- ;
porters of Frank P. Flint rigorously
resent the Insinuation that he was pro
jected Into the fight as the Southern
Pacific candidate, and the facts seem
to be that Mr. Flint did not take the
corporation into his confidence when
the subject of his candidacy was un
der consideration. The Los Angeles
Hxpress, a newspaper that is lending
its support to Mr. Oxnard. says:
Mr. Oxnard believes the n^xt I.*frislatur?
*>i!l tor to much of a unit in a desire to name
him that the big corporation* will bÂ» (dad to
ctarw their frierxifhlp by withholding an
laror.icm to his candidacy. That is the extent
of liis â¢TiBims" en the Houth-rn Pacific or any
ether ccrporTU* interest in this State.
The sentiment is almost universal
in the Republican party that Southern
California is entitled to name one of
the United States Senators from this
State. Leaders of the party hold that
it would be the height of political folly
to deprive the south of its Just right
t<Â« name Senator Bard's successor.
California's position in the Republican
column is due to the substantial ma
jorities for the party given by the
counties of Southern California.

REtions will ultimately unite on Bard.

HOW TO FIND OUT.
Fill a bottle or common glass with
your water and let It stand twenty- four
hours; a sediment or settling indicates
an unhealthy condition of the kidneys;
If It stains the linen It Is evidence of
kidney trouble; too frequent desire to
pass it. or pain in the back Is also con-
vincing: proof that the kidneys and blad-
der are out of order.

often expressed that Dr. Kilmer's

being compelled to go often during the
day. and to get up many times during
the night. The mild and the extraordina-
ry effect of Swamp-Root is soon realized.

ST. PAUL, July 19.â With the excep
tion of the repudiation by the Butchers'
Union officials of nominal control of
the; blockade at the Swift - packing
plant, there was little change in the
situation at South St. Paul to-day. The
women stenographers and several of
the leading officials of the Swift Pack
ing (jompanx^were the only persons al
lowed to pass the picket lines, and all
efforts to recruit the force of men who
have been in the plant for several days
were apparently successfully resisted.
The retirement of the union officials
was 'evidently brought about to head
off the . threatened Injunction proceed
ings against them. The move, how
ever, had little effect on the vigilance
of the pickets and . the persistence of
the. blockading forces, except that it
made their attitude more defiant and

CHICAGO, July 19. â The crisis in
the stockyards strike will) come to
morrow afternoon. The allied trades
unions in the stockyards, which are
certain to become involved In the con
troversy If it be not soon settled, held
a conference this afternoon and at its
conclusion a letter rw-as sent to the
packers asking for 'S v Joint conference
between representatives of the strik
ers, the packers and the allied trades,
to see if a settlement could not be
reached. To-night there was nobody
who would say that the packers would
agree to the conference and it is im
possible to say with certainty that the
meeting will be held, j,
Arthur Meeker, manager of. the Ar
mour Company, speaking for the oth
er packers as ,well as for his own es
tablishment, said that he would send
a reply to the letter in the morning.
He declined to say what the nature
of the reply would be.
Bread and ice are to be distributed
to needy families in the stockyards
district. In this way the packers are
to help the wives and children of the
strikers. This plan was announced by
Arthur Evans, attorney for Swift &
Co., in the following statement:
"It having come to the notice of the
packers that the families of their for
mer employes, now on strike, are in
need of bread and ice, Superintendent
Crosby of trie stockyards station of
the Chicago Board of Charities was
immediately notified that a carload of
ice and 1000 loaves of bread were at
his disposal for distribution daily
ornong those in need of help," with the
understanding that further assistance
of the same character would be ren
dered if necessary."
Weary of the turmoil and hardships
encountered while struggling for a liv
ing in the face of strikes and lockouts,
sixty-two families of the strikers left
Chicago this afternoon to return to
Austria-Hungary. There they will re
ceive less pay, they say, but their em
ployment will be more, steady and de
void of peril.

THE 'DEATH PENALTY
RENO, New. July 19. â Two young
children, one the daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. Laparry of this city: the other
the son of K. R. Miller and wife of
Susanville. met death to-day in a fire
at Susanville. The Humphrey Hotel
at that place was entirely destroyed
and the little ones perished in the
flames. To the efforts of an unknown
man is due the fact that the bodies
were saved from cremation. When
the big building was a mass of flames
it was learned the children were
asleep in one of the rooms on the sec
ond floor. After plunging into a water
trough to saturate his clothes the man
rushed into the burning building and
to the room. On the bed he found
the children dead from suffocation.
The room was a mass of flames by
that time, but the unknown did not
turn back until he had secured the
lifeless forms. A moment afterward he
rushed into the open air almost ex
hausted, but with the bodies upon his
shoulder.

VIRGINIA, Ner,' Jtily 19.â It was de
cided to make an attempt this after
noon to examine the fire damaged
Union shaft through the drain tunnel
on the 160-foot level, and Joseph
McDonald, Jack Richards, William
Byrne, Sol. Martin and George Wil
liams were assigned to the task. The
men had proceeded but a short dis
tance Into the shaft when McDonald
uttered a cry of distress and Foreman
Jones and others rushed to his assist
ance. A strong odor of gas told too
plainly what had happened. McDon
ald was hurried out into the air, but
life was extinct. Richards, Byrne and
Martin next succumbed fo the deadly
gas and were dragged into the air with
great difficulty and at great risk to the
lives of those who effected their rescue.
Physicians were quickly summoned
and they adopted heroic measures to
revive the men. After a long struggle
the asphyxiated men showed signs of
life and soon afterward regained con
sciousness.
It was thought that no danger lurk
ed in the tunnel and the men went into
It confidently. The gas was generated
by^ the fire of last Thursday. The
death of McDonald is particularly sad.

In accordance with their threat made
Monday night, the Brewery Workers*
Union No. 7, consisting of . more than
450 men. went out on strike and failed
| to appear yesterday morning at their
i places of employment. The Brewers'
i Protective Association has refused the
â¢ demand of the men for an. increase of
i wages . and has notified them that if
: they do not report for work this morn
ing at 7 o'clock non-union men will be
employed in the strikers' places. This
was embodied in a note addressed to
the Brewery Workers' Union.
The strike of the workers Is caused
by the refusal of the Brewers' Associa
tion to increase the pay of the men
from $20 to 522 a week and grant them
75 cents for overtime. There were sev
eral minor points, among them the hir
ing of apprentices, 'and both sides
agreed on everything- but the; wage
schedule.
Each side showed apparent willing
ness to settle its differences, but acted
as if jealous of the other. The Brew
ers' Association placed a proposition be
fore the union that they should resort
to aibitration to settle their differ
ences. The brewers surg^ested that a
man from each side should be chosen
and the two selected should choose a
third, so that the three could act as a
committee, with the understanding
that all should abide by the decision.
The brewers agreed that if the decision
should be against them they. would pay
the increased wages from the date of
the beginning of the strike. The work
ers seemed chary of this proposition
on the ground that the time of settle
ment would be prolonged and by an
overwhelming vote of 250 to 4 the prop
osition was rejected.
The association had already reached
an agreement with the. Beer Drivers'
Union and the Bottlers' Union' to give
them $2 more a week and 50 cents over
time. The drivers authorized their
committee to sign such an agreement,
but on hearing of the action of the
striking workers they reconsidered
their action. In the meantime the
bottlers and drivers communicated
with the international union at Cincin
nati to ask whether they shall join the
striking workers. Up to a late hour
last night no answer had been receiv
ed. In the course of events, however,
they must of necessity go on strike.
They may keep their positions as long
as they handle union beer, which is at
present in all the breweries. When that
supply runs out, however, the men will
be obliged to handle a non-union pro
duct and, according to the articles of
their agreement, they cannot do that.
In anticipation of the strike the
breweries have been working overtime
laying in beer, but at the best, the sup
ply will probably not outlast a week.
To run their breweries non-union, men
will have to be placed to work at once.
In the meantime the union has estab
lished pickets who patrolled the vicin
ity of the breweries all day yesterday.
The strike in San Francisco has
spread to other parts of the State.
Brewe.y workers in Alameda County
and Oakland walked out yesterday. At
the great Fredericksburg brewery in
San Jose the entire force of brewery
workers, bottlers, drivers and firemen
struck. The unions in Sacramento had
voted not to go out and a delegate from
this city is on his way there to per
suade them to join the movement.
Another delegate left yesterday for Los
Angeles, nothing having been .heard
from that city regarding the action vf.
the brewery unions.
MARTSVILL.E. July 19.â Georga
Morse, a laboring: man, was found dead
to-night on Thompson's fruit ranch,
five miles outside of this city, with
a bullet hole in the back of his head.
The police are now searching for Claud
Hankens, a 14-year-old boy who came
here recently from Alameda County,
as they believe that he killed Morst?.
Morse, who was about S3 years of
age, left this city in company with
the boy this morning to. go to the
ranch In- search of work. Morse 13
known to have had $$0 in his possession
at that time, but there was no money
in the pockets of his clothing when he
was found dead, about 7 o'clock to
night, by one of the ranch hands. The
disappearance of the boy at this time
leads to the belief that he killed Morse.
The officials throughout the county
have been instructed to be on the look
out for Hankens. Nothing is known
concerning him other than that he said
he lived in Alameda County when he
came here some days ago to look for
employment.

PERSONAL.
Mrs. Oddie was formerly Clare Bell
iicDonald, wife of Richard McDonald
of San Francisco, whose connection
with the sensational failure of the Pa
cific Bank several years ago led to his
arrest and long detention In the County
Jail in that city. She also gafned con
siderable notoriety through her elope
ment with Seneca Swalm, who after
ward was sentenced to imprisonment In
San Quentin. For a number of years
after this notoriety Mrs. McDonald re
mained in retirement, from which she
emerged to marry Oddie. Their nup
tials were celebrated in Carson City
on December 2 last and the wedding
created surprise among Oddie's friends
in Nevada, who are legion. It was
feared by his acquaintances that the
union would not be a happy one. It
seems that these apprehensions were
well founded.
The first intimation that Oddie and
his wife had quarreled was received
here yesterday, when it became known
that the popular mine manager had
left Tonopah hurriedly for San Fran
cisco. He had barely passed through
Reno on his way to the bay before It
was learned that Mrs. Oddie was in hot
pursuit of her husband. Unfortunately
for her plans, however, the train bear
ing her from Tonopah was derailed out
on the desert, where ; she and other
passengers were delayed for nearly
thirty hours. The wife finally reached
Reno, . where she was met by friends
of her husband, who, it is said per
suaded her to abandon her trip to San
Francisco and 6he reluctantly returned
to Tonopah. To-night it was common
talk on the street that Oddie's friends
here were endeavoring to reach' him by
wire in San Francisco with a view of
establishing a truce between him and
his wife, but had not met with much
success. One of these friends is re
ported to have left for San Francisco
to-day to confer with Oddie regarding
his troubles, and news as ' to, the re
sults of his efforts are anxiously await
ed here. ; ....
According to the report here Oddie
is in San Francisco conferring with
his lawyers and is expected to insti
tute proceedings there or in this town
in a few days. The ground upon which
his suit will be based is said to be
incompatibility of temper, although
gossip has it that the couple have sep
arated for more serious reasons.
RENO, Nev., July 19.â Society of
Reno was startled to-day by a story
from Tonopah to the effect that Tasker
L. Oddie, general manager of the Ton
opah Mining Company and one of the
wealthiest men in the new mining dis
trict, had engaged attorneys with a
view of filing a suit for divorce against
his wife, from whom he separated sev
eral days ago.

NEW YORK. July 19.â Somewhat im
proved hi health, Mrs. George Crocker,
who has been very ill In Paris, arrived
to-day on the Kronprinz Wilhelm from
Cherbourg with Mr. Crocker and her
daughters, Mrs. Phillip Keartiy and
Miss Alice Rutherford, and her son,
Alexander H. Rutherford.
Mrs. Crocker benefited rather than
suffered from the ocean voyage and to
morrow, with her family, she will go
to Newport on their steam yacht and
occupy their villa, Nethercliff. The
party are occupying a suite at the Wal
dorf Astoria.
Dr. Morris Herzstein of San Fran
cisco accompanied Mrs. Crocker from
France, having been summoned to
Paris to attend her when her Illness
became critical.
After the family are settled in their
Newport house Mrs. Crocker will be
under the care of Dr. William T. Bull.
It is said she will be able to attend to
the details of the wedding . of her
daughter, Miss Alice H.. Rutherford,
whose marriage to J. Langdon Erving
will take place- in Newport some time
next month, i ...
Social D'.epatch to The Call,
Senator Perkins delivered yesterday
a very interesting address before the
members of the Chamber of Com
merce at the quarterly meeting. He
briefly reviewed what had been ac-
Scomplished in behalf of California at
the last session of Congress and con
gratulated his hearers on the gener
ally ploasant outlook for the State.
He paid tribute to the v.-isdom of the
chamber in maintaining a representa
tive at the national capital and spoke
hiphly of the services rendered by
William Bunker. His remarks were
received with great favor by the as
pembl^d business men.
Secretary E. Scott presented an in
teresting array of statistics, which
showed how greatly Pan Francisco
has increased in prosperity since last
yea r.
A Wt<>r was received from Briga
dier General C. A. Wodruff, who ad
vires that the chamber send a repre
sentative to the Orient to look after
the port's interests in that part of the
world. General Woodruff says he
would be pleased to accept the posi
tion if the commercial men should so
derire.
William Bunker, the chamber's rep
resentative at Washington, then spoke
of th" advantages gained by San
Francisco in the growth of Pacific
trade. He paid particular attention.to
the subject of establishing a military
depot at San Francisco. In conclu
sion h" urged that trade with China
be increased. The chamber adopted
the following resolution:
"That we hereby respectfully re
quest the members of the Senate and
House of Representatives from Cal
ifornia to co-operate with the War De
partment in any efforts made to se
cure appropriations from the national
Coneress for the erection in San Fran
cisco of a military depot for quarter
master's stores and the construction
of docks for the army transport ser
vice.
During the afternoon a proposition
was presented for consideration look
ing to the amalgamation of the Can
adian order , known as "the Sons of
England" with the Sons of St. George.
This called forth opinions from the"
great majority of the delegates and
when the hour for adjournment was
reached all had not spoken on the
subject. Hence it was laid over until
to-day.
Clarence W. Riffee was appointed
press committee.
The election of grand officers will be
held to-morrow. W. G. Johnson of
this city, the vice" president, is the
logical candidate .for the office ;of
grand president, but yesterday it was
rumored that there might be an op
ponent at the time, nominations were
declared- in- order. â Â¦- Â¦â¢
, Last. evening the. grand officers and
delegates were the^guests of; Albion
Lodge, - Oakland, . when -there â¢ was an
entertainment and a collation.'
On Thursday night a banquet will
be given to the grand officers and'dele
gates by the -local lodges of the order,
Pickwick and Burnaby. . - >.
The' royal standard floated yester
day from the mast over the Red Men's
building on Post street to indicate that
it was the place where was being held
the thirteenth annual . session of the
Grand Lodge of the Sons of St.
George. . .
The grand body was called to order
by Worthy , Grand President J. H.
Cocking of Is'anaimo, assisted by the
following grand officers: W. G. John
son, San Francisco, vice president;
Thomas Poser, San Francisco, secre
tary; William Meek, Los Angeles,
messenger; William H. Price, Vic
toria, B. C*. assistant messenger; John
Stevenson, Nevada City, chaplain; E.
T. Joost,. Oakland, inside sentinel; F.
R. Pulford, Sacraniento, outside sen
tinel; G. B. Rosewell, Samuel Creba
and W. H. Noy, trustees, and . W. H.
Fuller, past grand president.
The annual report of the retiring
worthy grand president was read. It
proved a very interesting document
and was supplemented by a talk upon
the growth of the order during the
last year.
The report of the grand secretary
showed a satisfactory increase in
membership for the year in the four
teen subordinate lodges of the juris
diction. It also showed a flattering
financial growth.
F. D. Brandon of San Francisco
presented a new constitution for the
government of the Grand Lodge and
one for the subordinate lodges; also
a set of bylaws for each. These were
received and laid over for considera
tion at a future time during the ses
sion.

OAKLAND, July 19. â Suits were
brought to-day by Seymour Arada and
John Mitchell against Shlnglers' Union
No. 1 to. compel it to reinstate them to
membership. With Thomas Arada
they were expelled from the union sev
eral months ago. Thomas Arada
brought suit .to compel the union to re
instate him and won and the others
are following his lead.
In the tr{al of the case the Judge
found that' he had jurisdiction on ac
count of the fact that there was $200
in the. treasury of the union in which
Arada was interested. He also found
that there was no clause in the by-laws
of the union providing for the expul
sion of a member for working with a
non-union man.

BERKELEY, July 19. â In imitation
of the Japanese the Chinese have sent
a commissioner of education to this
country to study the system in vogue
in the schools and universities. The
commissioner is Ah Ging Tow and he
paid a visit to the University of Cal
ifornia to-day to see how education is
carried on there.. Accompanied by his
suite and guided by Professor Jerome
B. Landfteld, Ah Tow visited all the
buildings and departments and asked
many questions as to their j conduct.
Through his interpreter Ah Tow ex
plained that his Government had
commissioned him to come to Ameri
ca and gather data so that the Em
peror may be rightfully guided in the
establishment of a vast school sys
tem which is contemplated for China.
Millions of dollars will be soent in
time not only on universities, but a
secondary school system. The Gov

berkeley boy who "was
killed uy a bullet from a
Target rifle.
After hearing the boy's story the au
thorities allowed him to return home,
as they are satisfied that the shooting
was accidental.
Larkin B. Edwards, the father of the
dead lad, is employed at the California
Vigorit Powder Works. Willie was the
oldest of a family of three children.
When Mrs. Edwards was notified of
her son's tragic death she became hys
terical and is now under the care of a*
doctor. ;'\\. +?-Â¦. \
I have a 22-callber rifle at home and this
morning I made a target with a bell ami
fixed it up in the back yard. I fired a few
shots and then stopped for a while. Then I
began to shoot again. Just as I fired I heard
some one scream In the orchard. I climbed
over the fence and found this boy lying on the
ground. Then I ran to get some one to help.
I never saw the boy before, but they told me
that he wan stopping at Bridge's. There is a
creek running through the orchard, and Â» I
think the boy must have come up out of the
gully, for I did not see any one in the or
chard Juet before I fired the last shot.
The shooting, which was accidental,
was done by Everett Jordan, the son
of Fred L. Jordan, a carpenter, who
resides on Cherry avenue, next to the
Bridge home.
The Jordan boy, who is 14 years old,
had thoughtlessly fixed up a bell tar
get on the fence at I the back of his
home, which separates the yard of his
parents' home from the Bridge prop
erty. Regardless of the safety of oth
ers, the youth was shooting at the
mark with a small rifle. After firing
several shots, he stopped for a few
moments and then started to shoot
again. At the first shot he heard a
scream and the sound of a fall from
the orchard. Dropping his rifle, Jor
dan climbed over the fence and found
young Edwards lying on the ground,
unconscious.
Â¦ At first Jordan did not realize what
had happened, but a moment later a
blood stain appeared on the front of
the victim's shirt and then the shooter
realized that his bullet had found a
human mark. Jordan was badly fright
ened. He ran into his house, scream
ing for help. As soon as Mrs. Jordan
learned what had happened she noti
fied the injured lad's uncle, who at
once took the boy to the office of Dr.
J. H. Callen, but by the time he ar
rived there the victim of the shooting
was dead.
An examination of the body showed
that the bullet had entered the heart,
causing almost in.<=tu;it death. As soon
as Dr. Callen had pronounced life ex
tinct the Coroner was notified and the
body was removed to the morgue in
Oakland.
Everett Jordan was taken to the
District Attorney's office this after
noon, where he made the following
statement: ...,

With a pistol in her lap, Mrs. C.
Preston, who keeps a small grocery
and notion store in Fruitvale, sat at
her rear door and kept a constable,
three bondsmen and a bill collector at
bay for- 1 went v-four hours.
They had an attachment on her
place, but she is in possession and so
far their efforts to dislodge her have
been of no avail. She threatened to
put a bullet thrqugh the first man that
stepped inside her door and none of
the besiegers . so far have given any
indication that they want the honor.
This afternoon she left her step
daughter Lena, with the pistol. In
charge of the premises while she went
to the District Attorney's office and in
terviewed Deputy T. W. Harris in re
gard to her rights and also to see
whether she could not get a warrant
for the arrest of W. E. Dean, the.col
lector, for forgery, - she making the
statement that he forged the name of
Justice of the Peace W. R. Geary to
an execution of judgment served upon
her by Constable Thomas Carroll.
Carroll, while being the constable,
holds the world's record for throwing
the hammer. He was outwitted by the
woman who sat and eyed him with
her pistol close at hand. "While he was
engaged in putting the Sheriff's pad
lock on the outside of her front door,
Mrs. Preston went from her living
rooms m the rear and locked the door
on the inside, so that while she was
barred from going: out the constable
was also barred from entering. Then
she took her station at her rear door.
Sh*e barricaded herself and savs she
will hold the fort until she settles the
trouble in her own way.
Mrs. Preston says that all of her
trouble has been caused by Dean.
While he was collecting bills for her
he took bills against her and got all of
her creditors to give him their bills
and presented them all at- one time.
Her landlord, a painter by the name
of Slmmonds, she says, is also piqued
because she refused to marry him and
has doubled the rent on her and given
that bill also to Dean to collect. "With
bills coming: from everv direction the
woman made up her mind that there
was but one thing to do and that was
to close up until the storm had passed.
Mrs. Preston says she can meet all of
her obligations, but she will also take
her time about doing so.

The untouched wealth of an unhappy
wife, given by her husband as the price

cottage, but questioned by its occu

Mrs. A. D. Thompson, of 1S58 Eighth
street, this city; received an unusual
caller on last Saturday evening. The
name of 'the guest is unknown, but the
mission that took her to Mrs. Thomp
son's door is singular in the extreme.
While Mrs. Thompson was visiting
neighbors Saturday night a strange
woman called at her house and in
quired for her. Mrs. Thompson's lit
tle girl immediately summoned her
mother and in a few moments both
women were in earnest conversation.
The stranger informed Mrs. Thompson
that $5000 in coin was buried under her
hojise. The money had lain there for
years, paid the Informant, and the
amount a divorced man paid to his wife
after their separation. The strange
treasure-seeker wanted to tear out the
foundation from the house and to delve
deep Into the alleged mystery. Mrs.
Thompson informed her husband, who
Is a switchman at the West Oakland
railroad yards. Thompson was not
anxious to tear up the house and the
story has therefore rested. Mrs.
Thompson did not learn the Identity of
her visitor, who departed after being
denied permission to search for the
hidden gold.

Last year the assessment of the Con
tra Costa "Water Company reached an
aggregate of $5,000,000. This year, with
the reductions made in the franchises
end the water in the reservoirs, the
total assessment reaches less than $3,
iOO.000.
Examination of the assessment books
fhowg that while the Contra Costa
Water Company has been griven jrreat
reductions the Spring Valley "Water
Company's assessment has been con
siderably increased. The assessment
Huch being the case, and there being a ques
tion as to the validity of the assessments
against the franchise and water, I have deter
mined to pursue the course of assessing the
franchise and water at a nominal figure until
the courts have parsed on the validity of the
assessment. I have trl*<J for years to have
the matter of the aHFessmer.t against the wa
ter or>ror>any's franchise tested through th?
courts, hut have been unable to do so until
!aÂ« year, when the Board of Equalization re
fused to allow thÂ» assessment to be reduced
a* requested by the water company. Since
thrt time the water company has taken the
matter Into the courts and we will now have
a judicial determination of the matter. Had
the Board of Equalization years ago allowed
the assessment on the franchise to stand so
that It could have been taken into the courts
I would have pursued the same courm* I am
now pursuing. It Is a matter I feel should be
tfc-fcrrpin'-d ty the courts.
That being the case, If the taxes are so con
cluded as part of operating expenses and the
assessments oa the franchise and water are
continued and the decision of the courts should
bÂ« in favor of the water company and de
clare these assessments void then the company
would be' that much the gainer and the tax
payer* the losers.
With the Mayor's letter Assessor
D-\ltoti has given out the following
typewritten statement of his posi
tion:
I have reduced the assessment against the
Contra. Costa Water Company^ franchise and
water for tte reason that the assessment on
that porUon of their property is now In thÂ«
courts for a Judicial determination as to
whether they are assessable or not, and fur
thermore, from the light thrown on these mat
ters through the suit In the United States
Circuit Court of the Water Company against
the city of Oakland, and conversations I have
had with the attorneys for the city of Oak
land, es well as the accompanying opinion
frum Mayor Olney. I have concluded that it
is better for tÂ»-e people of this county that
only a nominal assessment should be pieced
on the franchise and water In as much as, ac
cording to the courts' present Interpretation of
the law the water company is permitted to
charre for the taxes and collect the amount
from the rate payers, as part operating ex
penses.

by the Council was that the Council had not
allowed the sum of $5O,0UO estimated to be
necessary to pay the taxes upon the franchises
and water of the corporation. It Is my opinion
that if these items are assessed and the taxes
collected fiom the Contra Costa Water Com
pany, the peopl*. and not the corporation, will
have to pay them. Kespectfully
WARREN OLXET.
]t is. therefore, questionable in my mind
whether any taxeÂ« can be imposed on the prop
erty of a corporation solely devoted to supply
ing a municipality and Its inhabitants with
water, but, however that may be, it Is clear
to me that the franchise of the Contra Costa
Water Company as puch has no value. Any
<<ther comvar.y or Individual may come into
Oakland and lay pipee In our streets, and there
fore tfwre It nu right conferred upon the CoiUra.
Costa Water Company that any other corpora
tion ot Individual may not avail of.
The definition of a franchise as contained in
all of the books' is substantially the same. viz. :
'Franchises are special privileges conferred
ly Government ui>on individuals and which
tio not belong to the citizens of the country
generally of common right." Keeping this
definition in view, you will Fee that the Contra
<'oiÂ»ta Water Company has not a franchise
within the terms of that definition. Therefore
it is my opinion that the County 'Assessor of
Alameda ought not to assess the franchises
rf the Centra Costa Water Company. I will
to further and say that I co not think the
County Assessor ought to assess the water
impounded and *tor*-d for the purpose of sup
plying the people. This water is by the very
terms of the constitution devoted to a public
use and if any taxes are imposed thereon the
consumers must pay them. The constitution
does not contemplate they Fhall do this, nor
is it right that they should.
For the profctioa of the rights of men who
invc-nt their money in these quasi public cor
lÂ»orÂ«ticns <as they are called) the courts havo
held that the Council in declaring what the
cr.nru Tiers shall pay muet so fix th<? rates' thiit
after paying -the running expenses there -hall
I* left a net Ir.come which shall be reasonable
ur.der all circumstances as compensation for
the uee by the public of the property. There
fore, in establishing the rates, the Council
mart provide, first, for the running expenses.
Including taxes, and then add a reasonable
i ate of interest on the value of the property.
That is to uy, the consumers of the wat<?r
mutt pay the legitimate expenses of the water
<oinpany and a reasonable return or interest on
the value of the property. These are the two
e mount* that must be paid by the consumer.
Included In the running expense*, of course, are
the ennual taxes levied upon the property of
the water company. Therefore it is not the
water company, under the scheme devised Sj; 
<>ur constitution, that pays the taxes, but It u
the water consumer.
PEOPLE PAY THE TAXES.
County Assessor Dalton's action in
reducing the assessment of the fran
chises and the water in the reservoirs
of the Contra Costa Water Company
from 52,445,000, which was the assess
ment last year, to the nominal value
of 51200 this year, resulting in a net
reduction of $2,443,600, was explained
by him to-day. Dalton made public a
letter written to him by Mayor Olney,
with whom he had conferred in regard
to the aFsessments, supplemented by a
statement made by himself. In his let
ter the Mayor advances the theory that
to assess water and franchises of the
water company and then allow the
company to include the taxes paid on
its assessments in its running expenses,
for which allowance must be made in
fixing water rates, is useless labor. His
letter is as follows:
OAKLAND. Cal.. July 16. 1WM. Hon. Henry
P. Dalton County Assessor. AlarufUa County,
rÂ»ar Sirâ Referring to our conversation of
ywtfrfay relating to the assessment of the
property of the Contra Cofta. Water Company,
asd especially relating to the assessing of Its
franchise, I beg to cay: '
A corporation fupplyine water to the Inhab
itants of a city occupies an entirely different
poKtirm from an ordinary private oorjHJratlcn.
It it a public utility corjioraticn In the etri<-tÂ«si
and coirrletest eeiw. much more so than a
en-pet railway company. The constitution of
our mate declare* that tbe use of water Is a
public use and that any corporation has the
right to lay pipes in the wtreet* of the city
in order to *upply the city and its inhabitants
with water. In return for this privilege the
corporation must assent to the Council fixing:
the rates that may be charE*-d for water. It
will thus bÂ« Â«een that the water i# for the
use of the public, that the City Council fixes
the rates that shall l>e charged by the corpora
tion rupplylng it, and that the corporation has
th P absolute right to use tho streets of the
<iiy in order to supply this essential of life.
It must continue to supply water as long as
the rates as fixed by the Council are paid.
It presents many aspects of a public corpora
tion as diftlnguifhed from a private cne.

the necessary two-thirds of the votes
cast. The same proposition was placed
before the people several years ago and
defeated. It was believed by many pol
iticians that the same fate, awaited it
this year, .when the Council of Women's
Clubs of Sacramento took hold of the
matter and started a campaign more
vigorous than the city had ever wit
nessed. The council went before the
Board of Health, and had it condemn
the present high school as unsanitary.
It next enlisted the assistance of every
fraternal order in. the city in behalf
of the project. The council has caused
every street car, every tree, every thea
ter curtain and every faction of all po
litical parties to blazon forth or talk
up the claims of the new high school.
It aleo arranged with the Southern Pa
cific Company to allow Its thousands of
employes time to vote.

The title to two diamond rings of the
aggregate value of $440 was argued be
fore Judge Fritz by former District
Attorney D. J. Murphy, representing
Mrs. Kittle Bennett of 304 Sutter streef,
and Attorney Arthur Mack, pleading
for B. Jacobs, pawnbroker at 702
Kearny street.
Mrs. Bennett testified that she was
In the court of Judge Mogan there
was a ruthless tearing away of the
mystery pertaining to a recent "illu
sion act" at the Chutes. Claude Alex
ander, manager of "Argo, the Floating
Lady," was accused of serio-usly as
saulting W. H. Nicholson, his as
sistant, his sole provocation being a
suspicion that the complainant had
"tipped off" the secret of how Argo
was made to float in the atmosphere
and strike entrancing poses without
having any visible material means of
support. Whether the suspicion of Mr.
Alexander was justified or not. Mr.
Nicholson certainly did "tip off" the
illusion when he mounted the witness
stand. In response to an inquiry from
the bench as to his occupation at the
time of the assault he said he operated
the iron rod that held up "Argo" while
she mystified and delighted all un
initiated beholders.
According to Nicholson's story the
assault was a dramatic affair. Under
neath the stage, with lights extinguish
ed for the purpose, he was knocked
down and kicked on head and body by
Alexander until his senses fled. Ere he
entered oblivion, however, he heard
Alexander soliloquize to the effect that
the limp body would be carried to the
highest point of the scenic railway
and from there dropped to the asphal
tum navement far below, whence it
would be removed to the Morgue as
the corpse of one who had fallen from
a car on the elevated track. The in
tended finale was frustrated by Nichol
son recovering consciousness and
crawling away.
Further testimony will be heard to
day. *-â¢-.;â¢
John Hansen, George Smith and C.
F. Frazer, deep water sailors, who
were windjammed around the Horn to
gether, celebrated their arrival from a
voyage thickly punctuated with storms
by drinking to excess and then indulg
ing in a three-cornered fight in a wa
ter front boarding-house. The land
lord of the establishment, alarmed for
the safety of his palatial barroom fur
niture, indiscreetly butted into the me
lee and endeavored to split out the
combatant. He was seated in a saw
dust-filled cuspidor and nursing a bad
ly mashed face when the policeman
arrived and arrested the battling trio.
When the quartet appeared before
Judge Fritz the boarding master's
head was a pitiful sight, while the
leather-like countenances of the three
mariners exhibited no sign of recent
punishent. As nobody seemed partic
ularly eager to prosecute anybody else,
one of the seamen declaring that he
would go to the brig and exist on wee
viled hardtack and bilgewater for life
rather than testify against a shipmate,
the case was dismissed.
The story was reminiscent of a
"thriller" at the Central Theater.
Time, 3:30 a. m., Thursday, July 14.
Landlady awakened from sound slum
ber by muffled noises. Traces them to
apartment rented to Howard Love,
night toiler on a morning newspaper.
She tiptoes to door and listens at key
hole until convinced there are at least
two persons 'n the room and that they
move and speak with a caution that
would not be exercised if their intent
were honest. Then she hangs on to
the door knob and yells for aid. In
mates of apartment grasp knob on
other side and also pull, but their
united strength cannot open the door.
Then they are nabbed by lodgers, who
fly to assistance of landlady.
Testimony for the prosecution was
concluded yesterday. Love identifying
as his own some plunder which the
burglars had packed up while in the
room, and various witnesses telling of
the coolness and pluck displayed by
Mrs. Blythe. Then the hearing was
continued till to-day, and as Bailiff
Mahoncy was escorting the two de
fendants back to prison he overheard
Geer remark to Benson that he intend
ed to kill Love. The remark was re
ported to the Judge and Geer will
probably be reminded of it when he
reappears in court this morning.
There was nothing of the traditional
heroine in either the appearance or the
manner of Mrs. William Blythe as she
sat in Police Judge Mogan's court
room yesterday morning and modestly
listened while witnesses told how she
effected the capture of two young and
apparently desperate burglars who
were ransacking a room in her lodg
ing-house at 511 Taylor street. Mid
dle-aged, rather delicate looking, and
with careworn facial expression, she
was about the last woman In the
world that one would suspect of pos
sessing/ the resourcefulness and cour
age credited to her by the testimony.
There was no appearance of the com
plaining witness. Mrs. E. Petrich,
against William H. Stansbury, charged
with sealing a purse from the woman
while she was standing near her resi
dence, 585 Post street, ;. last Sunday
night, and the case was dismissed by
Judge Conlan. Stansbury seemed to
be more aggrieved than pleased with
the dismissal, as he claimed ability
fully to prove his innocence of the of
fense of which he was accused.
Judge Fritz sent three cases to the
Superior Court, with bail in each fixed
at $1000. The defendants are Walter
Haynes, charged with having stolen
two calves, killing them and selling the
carcasses; C. L. Daniels, accused of em
bezzling $98 from the Illinois Pacific
Glass Company while employed as
claims agent for that corporation, and
Joseph Mann, who beat a woman on
the head with a bottle.
August Geber, charged with murder
ing the Hartmann brothers, Charles
and George, was in Judge Conlan's
court, but his arraignment was con
tinued till to-day on account of the
absence of witnesses who were attend
ing the funeral of George. The shoot
ing occurred on Sunday, July 10,
Charles dying instantly and George
lingering until last Sunday evening.
Judge Fritz delivered a scathing lec
ture to three small boysâ George Pine,
William Flower and George Farrellâ
who were arrested for disorderly con
duct last Sunday at the Seven-mile
House. They indulged in rabid hood
lumism on a street car, to the annoy
ance of passengers who were taking
advantage of the rest day to obtain
quiet recreation In the suburbs.
"This thing of hoodlums making
Sunday hideous for respectable folk
who venture to visit the suburbs will
be severely dealt with by me," said
his Honor, "for I understand it is on
the increase. These defendants are
young, and that fact is the only ex
tenuating phase of their conduct. The
case is continued until I can ascer
tain more about their general charac
ter."
Edward Beach and his wife were
married thirteen months ago and a 4
months-old Infant is said to be so bad
ly neglected by its father that the
Universal Service Society, of which
Mrs. John Pettee is the president and
active worker, has him before Judge
Mogan on a charge of failure to pro
vide for his minor child.
Mrs. Beach says there is another
woman In the caseâ baptismal name
Nellie, surname unknown â and that
ever since Mr. Beach met Nellie he
has had no use for his own family. He
Is a house carpenter, and was
temporarily pursuing his vocation at
Woodland when he met and became
enamored of Nellie, and now he haa her
living at his father's house on Folsom
street, where he spends most of his
time, leaving his wife to support the
baby as best she can.
The case will be more fully aired to
day.

It has been announced with authority that Alton B.
Parker will make few campaign speeches and will re
main at his Esopus home most of the summer and dur
ing the fall. And the American people will demonstrate
to him in, November that there is nothing in their af
fairs that will disturb the' continuity of his residence at
the New York hamlet far into the spring and summer of
next year. .
ROUND ROBINâ City. "A round
robin" is a circle divided from ths
center like the famed Arthur's table
whence It Is thought to have origi
nated. In edch compartment of the
robin is a signature, so that the en
tire when filled, exhibits a list
without priority belnj gtven to either
name. It Is. however, stated that the
round robin, without which a sailor
would think himself deprived of , his
right of petition, was first invented
in Athens, on the occasion of the con
spiracy of Aristogelton and Harmodius
against the tyYanny of Pialatratlde. The
Romans, in imitation of the Greeks,
not to indicate their preference to
any. either among their guests or
friends or selves, wrote their names
In a circle in such a manner \ihat it
was Impossible to say which was first,
second or last In their choice.
The Mexican Government has ordered ten murderous
robbers, who had dishonored Mexican citizenship, to be
shot to death for the assassination of three Americans.
The news should be sent broadcast among the South
American republics as an object lesson in the treatment
of outlaws who commit a double crime in assaulting
strangers within the borders of a civilized nation.
CARNATION'Sâ A. H. F.. Slippery
ford. El Dorado County. Cal. The car
nation is one - the finest of florist's
flowers, being a double variety of th*
clove pink, existing only in a state of
cultivation. The carnation Is not dÂ»Â»
vold of fragrance any more than the
clove pink. Many people confuse the
ordinary pink with the carnation.
WE -are beginning to learn more about Alton
Brooks Parker. The latest is that the Democra
tic standard-bearer is an enthusiastic swimmer.
Nothing interferes with his Honor's daily dip in the
waters of the Hudson. No matter the size of the Judge's
mail â and it is growing every day â it remains untouched
until Mr. Parker has enjoyed his swim; delegations are
compelled to wait in blessed patience until the personal
pleasure of the leader of the Democracy has been in
dulged to his heart's content. We do not blame him for
postponing the tasks of the day until after his natatorial
exercise, for he is then in more desirable condition to
withstand the many Democratic shocks that daily fall to
his lot. .
It must be an inspiring sight to behold candidate Par
ker standing on the bank of the river at Esopus pre
paratory to his matutinal plunge. Clad in a woolen
bathing-suit of attractive hue the physical picture must
be fair for Dem6cracy's hosts to look upon. And when
the standard-bearer makes his already celebrated dive
into the waters of the historic Hudson there must be en
thusiastic thrills up" and down Democracy's backbone,
that is, if there be any remaining after the physical tor
ture its poor old decrepit body has endured during re
cent years.
We suppose that long ere this the kodak enthusiasts
have taken many shots at the Judge, and" that the maga
zines soon will permit us to feast our orbs upon half
tones of the athletic proportions, accoutered in swimming
garb, as the sphinx-like celebrity of Esopus. And then
at the vaudeville houses the moving pictures will give
pressing in curves just what he may
expect from his chronometer under dif
ferent conditions of climate, and, with
his thermometer and barometer close
at hand, the sailing master may cal
culate to a nicety the correct time and
get his location to a certainty.
Each year the time chronometers of
the United States navy are subjected
to a test to determine their accuracy
and to correct any irregularities. This
operation commences in January and
usually, lasts until the middle of June,
and during that time it Is no uncom
mon sight to see 100 of these delicate
timepieces on ice at the United States
Naval Observatory. It is not for any
fear that these timepieces will spoil
that they are subjected to this frigid
experience, but It Is necessary for the
purpore of accurate adjustment that
they should all be maintained in a con
stant temperature.
The necessity of having the ship's
clocks all absolutely alike will be real
ized by the layman when he is remind
ed that an error of four seconds in the
chronometer means an error of a mile
in calculating the vessel's location. The
temperature varies at different times of
the test from 00 to 90 degrees and the
losing or gaining qualities of the chro
nometers under these conditions are ac
curately kept. Thus, with a chart ex-
Chronometers on Ice.

The Board of Health has once more been arraigned
by the Board of Supervisors for serious and various al-
Itged delinquencies in connection with a proper respect
for the civil service law of the city. The only glaring
flaw in the arraignment is the palpable fact that the Su
pervisors know no more about the secret policies and
purposes of local civil service than the rest of us do. It
is evident that in the administration of local civil ser
vice no man shall know it by its virtues.

On!y five of the eight Islands are
Icrgc enough to be important in a
forest study. In these there are two
distinct kinds of forest; one near sea
level In the drier portions of the
Islands, the other In the regions of
heavy rainfall on the mountain slopes.
ThÂ«Â»y never blend or even meet The
forest of ths rca level i3 made up ex
clusively of mesqults, so prevalent in
the drier sections of the southwestern
part of the United States. In the Ha
r.'AlIan Island*, however, it grows
much denser, taller and etraighter
thin In the States, having changed its
rtublt of croTvth m response to altered
â¢ or.ditionn. It lÂ» not native, but v/as

mcsiuit*. or. as there called, algaroba
ioredÂ«, Civhled among the eevera.1
tilsnds. The wood is chiefly valuable
In the Hawaiian Islands it Is now
recognized that forest preservation is
a matter of great and Immediate im
portance to the leading economic In
terests of the Territory. The chief
rgr!cu!tural interest of the islands is
*ugar growing. In 1903 the exported
Furar was valued at 525,3,10,684, or 96
per cent of the total exports. The
supply of water on which successful
oar.e cultivation depends comes to a
large extent from the forested higher
rlores of the mountains, above the
plantations. But the situation is com
plicated by the fact that cattle raising,
which In economic Importance stands
recond on!y to the sugar ln<3u&try. de
p*nda largely on the usÂ« of the forest
for range, and overgrazing has been
the principal cause of injury to the
rrater-holdirg power of the wooded
area.
As a preliminary to the formulation
of a far-sighted policy In the Interest
of the Islands as a whole, the Terri
tory a year ago asked for an examina
tion of the whole question on the
ground by an agent of the United
States Department of Agriculture. The
report of William L.. Hall of the
Bureau of Forestry, who made the
examination. Is now being printed as
bulletin No. 4 8, "The Forests of
Hawaii." Both from a scientific and
practical standpoint It gives much in
formation concerning these Hawaiian
fore!Â«tÂ« and their uses.
Forest Stripping in Hawaii.
The new science of criminal anthro
pology has done much to disclose the
cause of criminal disposition in men,
but it has no suggestions to make as
to the prevention or punishment of
crime. It can only classify the facts it
observes. Suggestions from expert
crlmlnologists are of no more value
than suggestions from any other kind
of men. The criminologist can tell us
(and small comfort it is so to be told)
that the professional thief is born and
not made, and that thief he will re
main by nature his whole life long.
The criminologist can tell us that it is
impossible to "reform" the criminal's
character without reforming his brain.
The counterfeiter who has spent forty
years In prison and is returned thither
at the age of 73 does not argue much
hope for the reform of criminals. But
what is to be done with him? How Is
It possible to prevent' a typical primi
tive, reverslve man such as the late
Czolgosz, from using political methods
which were quite common and natural
with Â£he savage ancestor of whom he
was a\ype born out of time? Czolgosz
did not slay because he was an anar
chist. He slew because he wa3 a prim
itive man. He was not an habitual
criminal, and it was possible that he
might never have acquitted himself In
an extraordinary manner had not his
environment, Joined with- his reversive
brain, set up the association of Ideas
and the consequent chain of circum
stances that culminated in his amaz
ing deed. The normal man is stupe
fied by the conduct of Czolgosz and his
kind; nor can the normal man under
stand the conscienceless burglar or
highwayman who slays to rob. If
these things are to be remedied, it is
not anthropology that can tell us how.

Where Science Fails.
Editor of The Callâ Dear Sir: In
your editorial of the 15th you mention
ed the fact that the millers of the
State are not pleased with the wheat
grown here because of the fact It is de
ficient in the quantity of gluten com
pared with that of the starch in the
California wheat. You think that the
flood o'f scientific knowledge.-^ based
on experience, will in the long run be of
value to wheat growers.
While I have no scientific knowledge
of wheat growth I have had plenty of
experience. Twenty years ago or more,
as I remember, the millers desired
wheat containing a great deal of
starch, as white flour, was the kind
they most desired. I think there Is no
wheat raised In the East that contains
more gluten than the variety formerly
raised extensively in this State. Thv
only objection to this wheat was that
It shattered very badly when ripe,
which could be prevented by using self
binding reapers, and cutting the wheat
before it was thoroughly ripe.

The cause of so many soldiers and
sailors â take the case of the Kin Shilu
Maru as an example â preferring death
to capture was something, widely dif
ferent from that which has been as
signed. The people of Japan at large,
soldiers and sailors included, had
heard so much of the Russian atroci
ties at Blagovestchensk. of the Rus
sian treatment of the Chinese at the
time of the Boxer troubles, and of
General Mltchenko's famous utterance
that the Russians had "no ropes, but
arms," significant of the short shift
that would be given to captives, that
the prospect of falling alive into Rus
sian hands came in reality to be re

Cases of seppuku, as a matter of
fact, were extremely rare, and case*

quent, were the expression of a wide

A vast amount of misconception
prevails in Europe concerning what is
vulgarly termed haraklrl. This word
is never used by any other than illit
erate persons in Japan. Among the ed
ucated classes the term employed i*
seppuku. It is wrong to suppose that
Japanese soldiers and sailors are prone
to throw away their lives
vainly. Seppuku, in ancient
times, was an honorable death,
but it is only resorted to in,
extreme circumstances. As the Jap
anese proverb puts it. "Sei wa katashi.
Shi wa yasushi" â "Life is difficult.
death is easy." For any person to
commit suicide merely as a way out
of a difficulty was esteemed, and is
still, a cowardly act. To take one's
own life is easy enough as a means of
procuring relief from trouble, but to
live on, despite difficulties, being a
harder matter, is the more creditable,
and this Is the meaning to be attached
to the proverb, which has quite as
much force to-day among Japanese as
It ever had.
Seppuku.
THE attempt of the San Francisco Board of Health
to make sanitary the dairies that supply milk to the
people of this city is responsible for a threat, by
certain dairymen, to increase the price of milk to twenty
cents a quart if they are compelled to conform to the
regulations of the board. At the same time these dairy
men aver that they are willing to comply with all rea
sonable rules and provisions that may be devised to keep
milk wholesome and fit to be consumed. It is safe to say
that the threat to double the price will not be carried out
under any circumstances. When an advance was made
in the cost to the consumer, some months ago. families
curtailed their quantity for daily use. A practically pro
hibitive price will throw into disuse, at least partly,
plants of large size, and capital invested locally in dairy
cows and dairy equipments will be, to a considerable ex
tent, dead money.
There can certainly be no justification for a threat to
cinch customers 100 per cent unless it can be clearly
shown that the cost of production will be doubled when
sanitary conditions are enforced. At any hazard, health
is the first consideration. The State Board of Health has
recently reported that 10 per cent of the deaths in Cali
fornia are unnecessary and that they can be traced to
bad milk. The connection between bacteria and diseases
of deadly effect is too clearly established to be open to
reasonable questioning. In legitimate precautions for
the preservation of the* lives and health of the people
the health authorities ought to be upheld by every good
citizen. The Health Board is appointed for the purpose
and draws pay from the citizens to safeguard their
homes by compelling hygienic conditions, and such offi
cials have no other excuse for taking salaries derived
from taxation.
What public sentiment can effect for the general good
is manifested forcibly at Seattle at this immediate time.
The dairies in the country surrounding Seattle were dis
covered to be filthy and to be conducted in a slovenly
way, with no regard for anything except direct profit to
the dairy owners. A popular outcry was occasioned. At
first the parties who were* supposed to be responsible for
â¢the making of proper analyses of milk declined to act.
A change has been wrought. The King County Medical
Society has been stirred to action and has just made a
report.
It is found that all the dairies supplying milk to Seattle
arc filthy. Samples of milk from thirty-six dairies have
been examined. Each contained Inultitudes of germs
of disease. Judged from the lowest acceptable standard
of purity, fully two-thirds of the milk furnished to Seattle
is unfit for use. According to the standard adopted in
Boston, Seattle receives absolutely no good milk. The
majority of the methods of Pasteurization employed in
Seattle are farcical for inefficiency. Dirty water is used
to adulterate the milk.
The King County Medical Society has therefore sub
mitted recommendations for an ordinance to govern the
care and sale of milk in Seattle. Very likely this ordi
nance will be fought by the dairymen of King County,
v/hose willingness to comply with health rules may be
estimated by their neglect of all such rules__in the past.
The question of reasonableness in the formulation of
regulations in this regard should be judged only from
the standpoint of efficiency to protect the children, the in
valids who are compelled to have a milk diet and the
public at large. Of that medical men are the best judges.
It lies in theft profession to know what conduces to and
what injures health. To leave the question to laymen
and to reach a "compromise" based on any ground
other than the welfare of the public is a sin against the
community.

It was in 1S72 when the Odd Fel
lows held a picnic at Redwood City.
1 On that occasion a gang of toughs
"butted in" with the otherwise orderly
attendance. Among the gang who
went from San Francisco was one
whose name was Hood Lummix. Na
ture would seem to have had a far
cical part in the creation of the orig
inal "hoodlum," for Hood Lummix
.was a most peculiarly formed crea
ture. Clumsy, big-footed, with a big
mouth and protruding teeth, thick
lips, a* big bushy head of hair of a
dirty brick color standing out like the
quills on a porcupine, this almost mal
formed specimen, as Is usual, attract
ed the attention of a lot of young
rowdies who picked upon him as be
ing an "easy guy" for a day's sport.
Go where he might, he was followed
by a gang who hooted and yelled and.
in brief, made things unpleasantly
lively during the day, but more partic
ularly in the afternoon when the
steam beer commenced to do its work.
The amusement of the gang did not
confine Itself to the picnic grounds:
on the contrary they went outside,
broke into orchards and flower gar
dens, destroying valuable property and
finally wound up the day by shooting
a valuable horse belonging to a
rancher. This last act was more than
the Sheriff of San Mateo was prepared
to stand and as a result he bagged a
couple of dozen of the chief offenders.
When the cases came up before the
Justice of the Peace in Redwood each
and every- one of the accused laid the
entire blame on Hood Lummix. Poor,
simple-minded Hood got six months
in jail and In sentencing him the Jus
tice, who was very much displeased
that he could not send the entire gang
to State prison, delivered a lecture
to the offenders, in which he said: "I
now warn you to keep out of this
county; we want no more of Hood
Lummix or his gang to visit us."
Hence the word became coined by
dropping the last syllable of the name,
making the word as now used, "hood
lum."
"Hoodlum." that word which has
found plnco in the vernacular of the
locnl lexicon, is well understood to
apply to ft class of objectionable young
toughs who have no respect for sex,
age or the rights of decent people and
no sense of what la proper or becom
ing/in the character of him to whom
the epithet is Justly appliedâ a hood
lum to-day, a criminal to-morrow.
While the meaning of the term Is
well understood by the people few
there be who know the derivation of
Ihe word and how It came to be forced
Into our language. It is this:
The Original Hoodlum.
SINCE the St. Louis convention the tendency of the
independent press of the country is to the support
of President Roosevelt. The Chicago Chronicle
has long been the only independent Democratic paper in
that city. It is a strong paper and under the able man
agement of the late Mr. Scott it achieved a reputation and
influence that even survived its support of Bryan in
1900. Since then it has repented of that one false step
and has been a constant advocate of sound finance and
common sense. But the St. Louis convention was the
last straw that broke the back of its patience with â¢ a
party that it had tried to discipline without avail.
Wkn the convention left out of its platform any
erence to the monetary standard and said that the
standard was not in issue, and that Judge Parker advised
it that the gold standard is so much in issue that he
would not run for the Presidency if the party did not ac
cept his views on that subject, the Chronicle said there
was too much jackdawing and it would carry its sup
port where all issues are considered and all principles
are firmly declared without reservation or sinister multi
plication of words, and it supports President Roosevelt.
This leaves the Democracy without a newspaper in Chi
cago. The anarchists, socialists and dynamiters have an
organ in Hearst's paper, which the party will probably
use^as an occupant in common with the gang of social
disturbers of the peace.
In this State the most influential of the independent
press is the Sacramento Bee. It has supported Bryan
twice and was prepared to support an honest Democratic
nomination this year. But the St. Louis convention was
too much for it. A Belmont candidate on the head,of a
ticket, with an anti-trust platform and a membex^of tlie
Standard Oil trust for the second place is a combination
that may be overlooked by some who have the same
view of the game of politics as David B. Hill and Bel
mont, but the Bee is not that kind and declines to shout
anti-trust while supporting a Standard Oil candidate.
The Bee is to be complimented on its consistent hon
esty. It has criticized President Roosevelt and recalls
nothing it has said, but it finds in him an honest and
courageous man, who may in some matters of adminis
tration be wrong, but who does things aboveboard and
takes the consequences. The Bee prefers to do its full
American duty rather than support D. B. Hill's candi
date. Mr. Hill's surrender to socialism in the last cam
paign in New York is not encouraging. Then with his
expropriation platform he was out in the open crying to
the people:
Slaves and fools,
Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,
And minister In their steads! â¢ â¢ â¢ â¢
Bankrupts, hold fast;
Rather than render back, out with your knives
And cut your trusters' throats! â¢ * â¢ â¢
/ Piety, and fear,,
Religion to the gods, peace, Justice, truth,
Domestic awe, night -rest, and neighborhood.
Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,
Degrees, observances, customs, and laws.
Decline to your confounding contraries.
And yet confusion live!
Now h^e is smirking under Belmont's wing and shed
tears when the two accomplished "a sane and safe"
nomination. No more offensive personality could grin
and gambol as the power behind a Presidential candi
date than he. He long ago lost the confidence of the
people of his State and the distrust of him is general
throughout the country. Judge Parker is unfortunate, in
his Warwick. The situation affects not only the inde
pendent press of the country but the independent voters
and thinkers. Bourke Cockran said that he left St. Louis
with not a ray of hope of the election in sight, but Judge
Parker's telegram on the gold standard dispelled the
gloom. Why it had this effect is not explained. Judge
Parker is not the hero of the gold standard battle. He
is a camp follower. The heroes of that battle arc the
Republicans who made the fight at St. Louis in 1896 and
the Democrats who were the come-outers in the same
campaign. Governor Flower and John R. Fellows, John
G. Carlisle and Senator Caffery were leaders in that
great group who were battling for the gold standard
while Judge Parker and Hill were voting for Bryan and
free silver.
Not all independent men hark back as far as 1896 in
giving reasons for opposing Parker. Mr. Timberlake,
Democratic nominee for Congress in the Steubenville
district, Ohio, who had begun his campaign, resigns
from the ticket, giving as a reason the raw work of the
St. Louis convention in nominating a trust ticket on an
anti-trust platform. David B. Hill is cunning beyond
most men, but. his artifice has overreached itself this
time.
Clearing for agricultural and home
stead purposes Is responsible for very
much of forest destruction. Since the
best use to which the lands of the is
lands can be put is agriculture, no
fault can be found with such cutting,
provided it is not carried so far .as to
curtail the water supply on which
agriculture Itself depends. The rain
fall of the forested portion of the is
lands is from 50 to 200 inches a year
and the native forests furnish the best
floor conditions for storing away this
water for future use. But when the
forest area is made smaller the storage
supply of water Is lessened. In addi
tion, it appears to be true In Hawaii
that forests influence the amount of
moisture precipitated. Where the
mountains, with their cooling atmos
phere^ do not extend their elevations
above 3000 feet, forests are especially
needed. The trade winds bring in fogs
and mists and the forests perform the
excellent function of changing these
to water and leading it to the ground
for storage. Thus continued forest
cutting means danger both to the
amount of water precipitated and to
the supply husbanded for the crops.
Both 'the principal crops, eugar and
rice, require much water for their suc
cessful growth. Already public opinion
In the islands has taken form in prac
tical forest preservation work. Sugar
companies have established reserves
for local protection, the area in one
case being as large as 50,000 acres.
Tree planting has been done on a large
scale by a number of land owners.
The Government began tree planting
twenty-two years ago, with an appro
priation of $12,000. A conclusive step
was taken when the last Legislature
provided for a forest policy and en
tered upon determined work to protect
and utilize the forests to the best ad
vantage. The first act to this end must
be the establishment of forest reserves,
which should Include practically all the
mountain forests. Fortunately the
Government owns most of these for
ests, although at present they are
largely under lease to private Individ
uals, mainly to cattlemen. It Is thought,
however, that an exchange of these
lands can be brought about. When the
reserves are established, a first neces
sity will be the extermination of the
wild cattle and goats and the creation
of a ranger service to keep out fire and
stock.
for fuel and fence posts. The forests
are exceedingly Important 'as furnish
ing a cover for the soil and abundant
food for Rtcfck. The mesquite pods
are eaten by cattle in summer, as they
fall to the ground from the trees, and
are gathered and fed dry all through
the year. Because of these uses and
the wonderful powers of reproduction
and extension which the algaroba for
ests possess, they are a most valuable
asset of the Islands.
The native forests are those of the
mountain slopes, and are all fissen
tially of a tropical character. About
three-fourths of the native forests are
composed of lehua. This tree is found
in regions of heaviest rainfall and
under best conditions attains a
diameter of four feet and a height of
100 feet. Commercially, except for fuel,
the wood has little value, for In dry
ing It checks and warps badly. Its
importance Is as a protective forest.
Its stand Is thin, but the most lux
uriant undergrowth is always found
beneath its small-crowned trees. In
deed, so luxuriant Is this undergrowth
of ie-ie vine and similar climbers, fern
growth ranging from, a few inches to
thirty feet in height, and mosses, that
virgin forests of lehua are often im
penetrable, dark jungles. Thus an
ideal condition is created for water
conservation.
The present forest area is about 20
per cent of the Islandsâ a small, frac
tion of what it was a hundred
ago. The destruction of the forests can
be traced to three chief causes: Clear
ing for agriculture, stock grazing and
grass encroachment.. Cattle were taken
to the islands In the eighteenth cen
tury and for years were protected by
rigid laws forbidding their slaughter.
By 1S15 they had so increased in num
ber as to become a menace. The anti
slaughter laws were repealed and grad
ually their number has been reduced
to the needs of the islands. But their
work of destruction has been accom
plished. Much of the undergrowth of
the native forests was or a succulent
character, peculiarly agreeable not only
to cattle.-but also to goats, pigs and
deer; all of these preyed upon the for
est and year by year their trampling
and grazing showed more plainly in
forest areas' wrecked and ruined. The
encroaching grasses occupied the
ground and prevented reforestation. In
the rainy districts the Hilo grass and
in the drier sections Bermuda grass
was the offender. Between them they
occupy vast stretches of country that
'were once well forested.
us the Judge in action. That, indeed, will be both highly
interesting and instructive to the followers of the Demo
cratic band wagon. If their leader makes a graceful
dive, as indicated by the moving "pictures, all good
Democrats should attempt to do likewise. If the Judge
shows' a preference for the side stroke in cutting through
the water all'ioyal Democrats should follow his example.
If the Judge seems to find pleasure in "fetching" un
der the water all good Democrats should make every ef
fort to do likewise. In Democratic swimming circles we
now. expect to hear of the "Parker dive" and the "Par
ker stroke," both of which assuredly will become popu
lar, and no one will be considered in the swim until he
has added them to his accomplishments. Democrats,
who have always had a happy faculty for "pointing with
pride" when they have not been roundly condemning,
will now point to the Democratic standard-bearer and
say with an excess of pride: "Behold the man. not of
words, but of action â the swimmer."

At the morning session the ordinary
business of the association was trans

Bhowed that the organization was in a
flourishing condition. The princi
pal features of the session were
the election of fifty-four new
members and an address by

growth of the gas question during the
last fifty years, the operation of gas
engines in large units, the labor ques

dwelt on the differences in piping, the
required pressura for the operation of
gas engines and the safety devices to
prevent the escape of gas in the event
of a light being blown out while at low

States Immigrant Bureau at this city
instituted an investigation and the
matter was reported to United States
District Attorney Woodworth.

Inwood and Parez paid Barber one
hundreds pounds sterling each on No
vember 2, 1903, and each contracted to
pay fifty pounds sterling additional not
later than May 2, 1901. In return Bar
ber agreed to furnish them board,

Mountain View, California, "for a
period of not less than one year nor
more than eighteen months â the exact
tSme to be decided by Barber." He

By direction of United States District
Attorney Marshall B. Woodworth, As
sistant United States Attorney Charles
M. Fickert filed five complaints yes
terday in the United States District
Court against George W. Mosher and
H. C. Barber for violating the act of
Congress approved March 3, 1903. en
titled "An act to regulate the immi
gration of aliens into the United
States."
Mosher is a contractor and builder
doing business at Palo Alto. There are
three complaints against him to recover
an aggregate penalty of $3000 and costs
as provided for by the act. There are
two complaints against Barber to re
cover an aggregate penalty of 52000 and
costs.
It Is alleged that Mosher on April
3, 1904, went to "Windsor, Nova Scotia,
Canada, and entered into an express
parole contract with Edgar C. Burgess,
Everett Burgess and Warren E. Harvie
to employ them as carpenters at Palo
Alto at wages of $4 a day, and that
under this contract they went to Palo
Alto and worked as carpenters.
The complaint against Barber
charges him with having made a writ
ten contract with John Inwood and
George Neaves Parez in London,
England, on November 1, 1903, where
by they were eventually to be em
ployed on Barber's farm at Mountain
View as farm hands at wages of $&0
per month each. The contracts are
identical, with the exception of the
names. They contain the following
conditions:

by Mr. Reeves in a short but apt
speech, In which he took occasion to
give the lion's share of the credit for
the success of the work of his office
and of the dinner to his very efficient
staff and his fellow committeemen.
The Duke of Marlborough, in propos
ing "The Colony of New Zealand,"
The usual loyal toasts were proposed
by the chairman and enthusiastically
responded to. All of the speeches were
commendably brief and the formal pro
ceedings were over by 10 o'clock. This
gave the company ample opportunity
for exchanging views ana Indulging in
reminiscences.
The Hon. H. F. Wigram, mem
ber of the New Zealand Legislative
Council, gave the toast. "The Imperial
Forces of the Empire," and referred
to the part which New Zealand tocrk
in the Boer war, when she supplied no
less than ten contingents â a larger
number in proportion to the population
probably than any other colony of the
empire. The increase in the subsidy
for the British navy, he said, "indicat
ed the sympathy of the colony with the
imperial forces, while the preferential
tariff in favor of British goods showed
a desire to meet the mother country."
Mr. Wigram was followed by the
Earl of Glasgow, who said: "The mag
nificent way in which New Zealand
came to our assistance would never be
fcrrgotten."
The British Australian of London, in
its issue of June 30, gives a full and
interesting report of the "annual New
Zealand dinner," held on June 23 in
that city at the Trocadero restaurant.
There was a large and distinctly rep
resentative gathering of New Zealand
ers and a number of distinguished
guests, among whom were the Duke
of Marlborough, Under Secretary of
State for the Colonies, ana the Earl of
Glasgow, formerly Governor of New
Zealand. The Hon. W. Pember
Reeves, agent general and chairman of
the committee, received the guests on
entering and presided at the table at
which were seated over 200 persons.
With the Duke of Marlborough as
practically the guest of the evening the
chairman made a new departure In the
toast list and instead of giving "The
Colony of New Zealand," as usual, left
that toast to the Under Secretary for
the Colonies and replied to it himself
in an incomparable manner, without
introducing any subject of a contro
versial character.

- GRAPE-XUTS.
Every Brain-worker wants a strong 1 , keen thinker in his HEAD QUARTERS. Many successful men and women
regularly eat the brain-making food â GRAPE-NUTS.
For the Phosphates necessary for this purpose are intentionally supplied in GRAPE-NUTS in liberal quantities
and will positively rebuild the worn out brain and nerve centers. ,
The Inventor of GRAPE-NUTS
About 10 years ago found himself badly off from overwork and weak digestion.
He experimented about two years, seeking to perfect a food that would contain the elements required by Nature
to rebuild the depleted nerves and brain.
BUT such food must be made easy of digestion, else the weakened organs of the body could not extract the re-
building elements.
Finally success came, after dozens of experiments and failures. The right parts of Wheat a^nd Barley were se-
â¢ lected, skillfully blended in the right proportions. Subjected for hours to moisture, then hours more to slow heat,
gradually producing chang es and mechanically digesting the fool. Further processes follow, until the food is finally
delivered fully cooked., pre-digested and ready for instant service with a little rich cream.
Years have gone by and experience has shown that the now famous brain food planned for a purpose, accom-
_â It does supply pre-digested food that a babe or an atlilete can digest.
It does furnish the nerve centers and brain with the delicate, microscopic particles of natural Phosphate of Pot-
ash which combines with Albumen to make the gray matter filling the nerve centers and brain.
It does prove itself to users in a very few da vs. ' >>Â»

the Supervisors' meeting next Monday
afternoon. At a meeting of the mem
bers of the association It was held that
the restriction and rules proposed by
the ordinance would necessitate the
raising of the price of milk from 10 to
20 cents a Quart. John D. Daly, who
presided, held that the proposed ordi

great expense to the dairymen who,
while willing to improve the quality
of the milk supply, cannot submit to
rules that would be disastrous to them
from a business standpoint.

NEW YORK. July ID.â Police In
spector Brooks and forty detectives
went to Brighton Beach race track
this afternoon and blocked all racing
news sent over the Western Union
wires by the filing of scores of mes
sages after each race. Between 2
o'clock and 4 o'clock the police filed
400 telegrams and sent a similar num
ber of telephone messages. The pool
room men were frantic over thi3 ac
tion and what little news they re
ceived had to be sent from outside
wire sources and was very late. ThÂ«
service for newspapers was also de
layed.
Inspector Brooks declined to ex
plain this action, but some of the de
tectives were more talkative. They
said that complaint had been mada
that commercial telegrams were being
sidetracked by the Western Union in
favor of racing messages. No one but
the poolrooms had a chance at tha
race track telegraph office, it was said.
A test case was being made, explained
the detectives, to see how much there
was in the complaint.
Inspector Brooks and His Squad De
lay Messages to New York

PORTLAND, July 19.â It was a
clashing good game with fee score a
tie in the ninth inning. Then the Tigers
showed their true nature, and devoured
theJr playmates. Keefe had to be re
lieved by Thomas to win the game,
but if Butler had received proper sup
port the tale might have been different.
In the ninth, with the score 3 all,
Graham, the first man. up. flew out to
Xadeau. Thomas hit to left and Camp
bell juggled Doyle's warm one. A single
by Sheehan brought Thomas home.
Nordyke slammed the ball so hard that
It slid through Raymond's glove and
hit the Brown in the ribs.
Doyle sauntered home, followed soon
by Sheehan on Lynch's long swipe to
McCreedle. Casey's sinple scored Nor
dyke. When the Browns came up
Nadeau and McCreedle hit safely, but
the next three went out in rapid order.
The double umpiring or O'Connell and '
McDonald gave great satisfaction. The

Sum Paid.
At a meeting of the Public School
Teachers* Annuity and Retirement
Fund Commission held yesterday with
Mayor Bchmitz and Superintendent
Langdon present demands aggregat
ing $2398 90 were drawn In favor of
thirty-nine annuitants for the. quarter
ending June 30, 1904. The retired
teachers who are supposed to receive
the maximum anuity were paid but
$22 per month Instead of $50, as for
merly. This 'Is owing to the inade

solve the problem, but nothing definite
has yet been agreed upon.

Weight is not worrying Eddie Han-
Ion or his trainer. Frank McDonald.
When the little boxer jumped upon the
scales yesterday he tipped the bar at
132 pounds, two pounds above the notch
at which he has agreed to weigh in for
"Battling" Nelson. With nine days
still remaining to dispose of the sur
plus avoirdupois the next opponent of
the slashing Scandinavian can take
matters easy and be at the required
mark when the weighing in time ar
rives.
Eddie was permitted to pull on the
gloves yesterday for the first time in
a week, and he and Toby Irwin gave
and took punches for three rounds.
Trainer McDonald directed the boxing
and at the end of every period saw
that the mitt wielders rested for the
full minute. Hanlon did not use his
crouch," but stood up straight and dis
played improved rapidity and clever
ness with both hands. He pummeled
the bag for six rounds, twisted the
wrist machine for six minutes and
hurled the irediclne sphere for ten min
utes.
When Hanlon went out on the road
for his usual morning spin yesterday
he was a"cÂ«mranied by Trainer Mc-
Donald and Iiwin. The trio walked
and spurted for six miles, and Eddie's
chief handler found no fault with his
method of exercising on the highways.
Tj-day Ff.nlcn will spar with Fred
Landeis and will go into action In his
crouching position. Landers Is about
the same size as "Battling" Nelson,
and Hanlon plans to practice on him as
!f he were his next opponent.
"Uattllng" Nelson continues to train
hard end faithfully at Larkspur and at
the present t'me the Chicago lad loiks
to be ready for the clang of the goni?.
He did his usual turns yesterday ani
among the 01 my of visitors at the trail
ing quarters rcne were more Interested
than several young women who jour
neyed all the way from this city *.o s>ie
how Nelson worked out.
He is dÂ«irr a lot of boxing and !eads
his srarring partners a merry life. All
of them are more or less battered up
and each is wishing that training days
were ever. Nfison can make the weight
almost any time now and from np
pearnncos he will be stronger and in
Letter ccnf.ilion generally than when
he faced Mm tin Canole.
Jeffries is in the best ot spirits and
says he feels ready and fit for the
hardest kind of a fight. Mrs. Jeffries
will accompany her husband to Har
bin. Billy Delaney will leave on Fri
day to be with the big man until after
the fight.
OAKLAND, July 13- â Champion
James J. Jeffries arrived thi3 morning
from Los Angeles, accompanied by his
wife and his brother Jack. The b!g
fellow looked well and is able to walk
without the aid of a cane. The Injury
to his knee is entirely healed. Jeffrlea
said to-day:
"My leg is now as strong aa It eves
was and there will be no need of any
further postponement of the fight with
Munroe. As far as that goes, though*
when the bell calls Munroe and my
self together on August 25 I will be in
the ring if I have to go on one leg.
"I shall remain In Oakland for a few
days and shall then go to Haxbla
Springs to resume training for the
fight."
Jeffries will leave to-morrow morn*
ing for Harbin. Dr. William S. Porter,
who atended the champion, said, after
an examination of the injured knee:
"The swelling has subsided In the
knee. The water has been entirely ab
sorbed and there is no pain or lame
ness about the Joint. Jeffries Is In fin*
spirits and will not be inconvenienced
by the injury unless he should meet
with another accident. AH danger oX
weakness or stiffness In the knee Joint
has passed."
Foley showed to good advantage In
the first few rounds, being able to
punch Barry almost at will and avoid
returns. He cut Barn* about the face
in the fourth and fifth rounds and had
his man groggv at the close of the
fourth. In the sixth Foley attempted
to exchange blows with Barry and in
the slugging that followed he was
floored twice and was saved by the
gong.
The seventh round had progressed
but a minute and a half when Barry
caught Foley a left hook on the point
of the jaw as they broke from a clinch
and the latter went down and out.
Jim Trimble knocked out Tom Cos
tello in the fourth round and Frank
Fields disposed of Pat Meany In two
rounds. There was a large attendance.
The fight was managed by the Century
Athletic Club.
LOS ANGELES, July 19.â Boxing
was resumed In Los Angeles to-night
after an interval of eight months.
Dave Barry knocked out Harry Foley
in the seventh round of what was to
be a twentv-round go. Both men are
from San Francisco and furnished the
chief attraction of a very interesting
show.

BRIGHTON BEACH, N. Y., July 19.
Thousands to-day saw a good ' per
formance when E. R. Thomas' St. Bel
lane ran a creditable second to James
McLaughlin's Pasadena in the Sun
shine stake for two-year-olds. St. Bel
lane has never failed to run a good
race, no matter what class it was that
he was meeting. In the stake to-day
he was conceding twenty pounds to
the winner, Pasadena, and was beaten
not much more than a length and a
half in the good time of 1:07 1-5 for
five and a half furlongs.
Perhaps the most sensational victory
of the day was that of Sonoma Belle,
ridden by J. Cochran, brother of H.
Cochran. . The boy is of limited expe
rience, but was good enough for his
father to entrust him with the piloting
of the mare and the result was victory.
The judgment of the father was vindi
cated. But the few who saw how far
behind Sonoma Belle was for the first
six furlongs thought she had a win
niDg chance.
Far In front of her were Palm Bearer
and Stamping Ground, racing each
other as if each succeeding furlong
was the last. This cutthroat pol
icNat last began to tell and then So
noma Belle was seen to be coming on.
She passed Stamping Ground in the
last furlong. A few jumps short of
the finish she got upon even terms with
Palm Bearer and at the judges' stand
she was in front by half a length.

CHICAGO, July lj>.â There was no
particular feature to the racing . at
Hawthorne to-day, the card being made
made up of cheap fields, with no
semblance to class in any of the events.
The race that attracted the most at
tention was the third, in which Cele
bration, Federal and Frivol, all long
shots, furnished a hair-raising finish,
being heads apart at the wire and so
close together than only the judges
could place them as they finished. SL
Hera, a 6 to 5 favorite, finished tax
back, while Crestfallen, a well backed
second choice at 13 to 5. was last.
It was a complete upset for the tal
ent, as the three first horses went up
in the betting, Celebration, winner, be
ing 13 to 1, Federal 6 to 1 and Frivol 20
to 1 at post time. Celebration was
considerably the best. He took the
lead after rounding the first turn, and,
although Crestfallen and St. Hera both
tried to outrun him, they failed, and
then Federal took up the effort at the
final eighth pole, .where Frivol also
Joined them. Celebration showed won
derful gamenees and under a vicious
drive outstayed them and won by a
short head.
As the four favorites won, the talent
again had the bookmakers on the run.
The track was fast, weather pleasant
and attendance above the average.

Freiffht Rates Reduced.
Coastwise freight rates on lumber have been
reduced 50 cents per 1000 feet. The rate from
Pucet Sound ports to San Francisco is now
f4 and $5 to southern ports. The reason for
this reduction In rate Is found in the fact that
there are more boats than business. Lumber
is cheap and large stocks have accumulated
In all the important yards. The Tacoma mill
has Fhut down and will remain closed until
lirices recover. With price* as they are the
margin of profit to the mill in raid to b3
small and it is partly to Induce the mill men
to continue running their plants that the re
duction has be*n made by the steam schooner
people.
Two Overdues Safe.
Two vessels of the overdue fleet were heard
from yesterday and the reinsurance list has
dwindled to the Ems and the Pioneer, each
quoted at 15 per cent. The Norwegian bark
Parknook. which w-as quoted at 45 per cent,
arrived safely at Trinidad. The Swedish bark
Julius Palm, out K5h days from Bangkok for
Ilha Grande and quoted at 12 per cent, is re
ported as having been spoken. Neither date
nor location of the speaking is known here,
but the vessel's name has been withdrawn
from among the reinsured.
Costa Rica Is Slow. Boat.
The Pacific Mail Company's steamship Costa
Rica, which is taking the place of the George
W. Elder on the run between here and Port
land, arrived yesterday from the Oregon port
nearly half a day late. The Costa Rica takes
about ten hours longer than the Elder to make
the trip. The Elder is being equipped with
oil burners and probably will be faster than
before when Ehe again goes into commission.
Will Discharge at San Pedro.
The steamer -Santa Barbara, which was
towed Into port Monday disabled through the
breaking of her tail shaft, left on Monday
evening for San Pedro in tow of the steam
schooner San Pedro. The Santa Barbara will
discharge her cargo of lumber at the southern
port and will be towed back here for repairs.
The G. C. Lindaurr, which picked up the
Santa Barbara soon after the accident and
towed her to this point, will discharge her
car;o here.

Notice to Passengers.
The British company was able to
make such a low bid, it is said, on ac
count of the low rate at which they
can get the drydock at Esquimau.
In spite of this, however, the steam
ship company favored the builders of
the Oregon and the Algoa will be re
paired here.
On the strength 6f these extensive
repairs it Is thought probable, when
they are finished, that the Pacific Mail
Company will apply for American
register for their big freighter, which
now flies the British flag.
The accident to the Algoa spoiled
what would have' been the greatest
money making record in the history of
the big vessel. When-Captain Lockett
ran the Algoa on the rocks she was at
the end of the second trip she had
made across the Pacific within' a re
markably brief time. Going and com
ing each time she had been loaded to
her full capacity. She had received
quick dispatch wherever freight was
handled and but for her misfortune
would have shown a profit which
would have insured smiles for the
skipper from those in authority.
Although the actual damage done is
covered by insurance, the loss through
the vessel's idleness will be heavy, as
there was enough freight offering to
have kept the Algoa, big as she is,
busy for a long time.
The Union Iron Works has been
awarded the contract for the repairing
of the Pacific Mail Company's bis
freighter Algoa, and this In spite of
the fact that the bid of the local con
cern was $20,000 higher than that of
the British Columbia Machine Works
of Victoria. The Union Iron Works
will do the work for $68,000, and no
time will be lost in making a start, as
every day the big vessel is idle means
added loss to the Pacific Mail Com
pany.

STOCKTON, July 19.â When the
court convened this morning to con
tinue the examination as to the suffi
ciency of the fugitive warrant upon
which the alleged diamond thieves
were held Mrs. Brown-Sabin did not
put in an appearance. Her bail of
$2500 cash was declared forfeited and
a bench warrant was issued for her ar
rest. Her attorneys professed ignor
ance of her whereabouts.
An investigation showed that her
presence in her room at the California
Hotel had been noted as late as 1
o'clock this morning. Later the key
was found in the door and it was
found that she had packed her valise
and gone away. It is believed that
her love for the man whom she called
Brown and declared to be her hus
band was the motive for her flight, her
desire being to join him." he having
been taken away last night by Sheriff
Whitlock of Vermillion County. 111. It
has also developed that Kendall Is part
negro, his father being a negro.
A strong effort will be made to get
the butter makers of California to
pf ther in one strong association. Here
lofore those of the north and those
south of Tehiichapi. though they have
not exactly pulled apart, churned
separately. Concert of action among
them has not been possible. The cen
tral body of the butter makers of Cal
ifornia Is the California Creamery
Operators' Association. They have
held several conventions at which the
northern workers have drawn closer
together. There are various matters
of concern to all creamery operators.
Not long ago they were interested 1 in
a proposition to improve the educa
tional facilities of the State by estab
lishing a separate school to teach
dairying on the property given by Miss
Flood to the University of California.
They have Â¦ been interested in raising
th*Â» standard of butter and in keeping
out of the State process butter, that
the home product might possess the
home Held permanently.
Owing to the fact that the conven
tions have been held In this city the
creamery operators south of Tehacha
r>i Pass have never taken part in the
proceedings because of the expense of
*oming so far and the time to be con
sumed en route. The executive com
mittee of the Creamery Operators'
Association has voted to hold the next
convention of the association at Fres
no. Secretary "\V. H. Saylor has just
made the arrangements at Fresno for
the event, which will take place in No
vember, before Thanksgiving. The
Fresno Chamber of Commerce has
agreed to entertain the 200 delegates
from the northern and central por
tions of the State and possibly, a large
delegation will come from Southern
California.
There are large dairy interests in
Orange and l^os Angeles counties to
be represented. Fresno was accepted
as n midway point and also because
it [a the center of the great dairy in
dustry of the San Joaquin Valley. At
the coming convention it is possible
that Chief Alvord of the dairy division
of the United States Department of
Agriculture will be present. He has
written that he will attend if he can.

yii pair toothpicks
In Esfes' Pofefied and Engraved Turned-Wooden Boxes
These are the genuine "WORLD'S FAIR" Toothpicks, put up in handsomely engraved
and polished boxes. The engraving is in colors, directly on the wood (not a label), and the
boxes are hand polished in the natural color of the wood, thus displaying to the best advantage
the fine grain of the silver white birch from which they are made. In a word, it makes a very
artistic package, and the most attractive novelty of this kind yet produced.
The "WORLD'S FAIR" Toothpicks themselves are so familiar as to hardly need de-
scription â they are rounded, polished and sliverless, and admittedly the finest and most popular
American pick on the and are sold in every section of this countrv.

in red and black, and as the cut reads. The box has a very neat appearance, and is filled with
about 300 of these popular, high-class toothpicks. When empty box makes a verv suitable re-
ceptacle for hairpins, cuff, collar buttons, etc.", and is a valuable and ornamental addition to any
dresser. The premiums are free to Want Advertisers in Sunday Call only. Gifts given Thurs-

Late Shipping Intelligence
LONDON, July 19.â In the House of
Lords this afternoon Earl Grey (di
rector of the British South African
Company), brought up the question of
American and British freights to South
Africa. He complained bitterly of the
discrepancy in favor of New York and
pointed out that under the existing
system the proportion of manufactured
foodstuffs shipped from New York to
South Africa was steadily increasing.
The Earl strongly condemned the re
bate system and urged the Government
to co-operate with the various colonial
Governments with the object of form
ing an independent shipping combina
tion which would secure 10 British
shippers the advantage now enjoyed
by Americans.
Earl Grey Complains of New York's
Advantage In Shipping to
South Africa.
EXPORTS OF AMERICANS
WORRY THE ENGLISHMEN
Major General Lord Dundonald, the
former commander of the militia of
Canada, was recently dismissed by the
Dominion Government for indiscretion
and insubordination, as it was termed,
as shown in a speech in Montreal, June
23, when he said he regretted that poli
tics had entered into Dominion mili
tary affairs, as it would be impossible
for Canada to have an efficient soldiery
under such circumstances.
LONDON, July 19.â In the House of
Commons to-day David Lloyd-George
(Welsh Nationalist) moved an ad
journment of the House to call atten
tion to "Lord Dundonald's participa
tion in political agitation against the
Government of Canada" while still an
officer in the British army. Lloyd-
George wanted the Government to rep
rimand Lord Dundonald.
Winston Churchill seconded the mo
tion that Lord Dundonald ousht to
have been recalled. Â»
War Secretary Arnold Forster, on
behalf of the Government, deprecated
the raisins of the question, especially
as the Canadian Government had not
mentioned the subject and was well
able to take care of itself. Nobody, he
said, had suggested /that Lord Dun
donald was guilty of anything beyond
want of judgment and he declined to
express an opinion on the matter until
Lord Dundonald, who had been re
quested to return home, had been
heard in his own defense.

The will of the late John Sroufe
was read yesterday at the family resi
dence, 1160 Page street. The entire
estate was left unconditionally to the
testator's wife, Mrs. Zelda Sroufe.
The will contained no other be
quests and granted full powers to hla
helpmate, who had for fifty-four years
been the sharer of his joys and sor
rows.
In the will Mr. Sroufe said that he
purposely omitted bequests to his
daughters, Mrs. J. F. Merrill, Mrs. J.
R. Loosley, Mrs. W. Z. Tiffany and
Mrs. Germona Cippolloni. for the rea
son that he knew his wife would treat
them all justly. A request was made
that his widowed sister, Mrs. Pauline
McGuire, now living at French Gulch,
in Trinity County, should be provided
for during her life.
Their father's disposition of hlÂ»
property met with the entire ap
proval of the four daughters, who
were all present when the will was
opened- The estate is reported to ba
valued at about $500,000.

NEW YORK. July 19.â The etock market
was rather reactionary to-day up to near the
close and there was a rather general ac
quiescence in this condition on the part of
specu'Mtve operators who have had the leader
ship or the recent demonstrations for higher
prices. The plausible explanation offered for
the Â«ntiÂ«ual restraint on the part of a class
of Individuals rather prone to excew was that
the rise In prices was going too fast fo- ltÂ«
own good and that a reaction wag normally
dUe - V"iu re * rtIon wa Â« Peking, however, in
some of the normal appearances. The usual
reaction In a bull market Is likely to com"
in a fiurry after a flnal upward resh and
great animation In the trading, duo to the
final measure, of. the leader, to unload tVlr
holdings at a profit. The first wlsL in

down ?ie^c to at 88Â«4c to 88%c. On
the break there was considerable covering by
shorts, but the demand was not ,heavy enough
to cause another slump. Later the market re
covered much of the early loss as the result
of the buying induced by prospects of a big

ceased and the market Is gradually working
around Into good shape. Bartlett Pears were
still plentiful and ruled weak at lower prices,

stock. Occasional sales of Plums In bulk were
reported for canning account at prices ranging

tinued firm and active, with the canners pay--
Ing as high as $33 per ton for the best stock.
Strictly fancy offerings from Martinez sold In
small parcels to the regular trade at 2*4c per
pound, but 2c was the ruling price for offerings
from other sections. Grapes were in free sup
ply, but offerings were Mostly small and sour
and found few buyers. Cantaloupes and Nut
meg Melons from Fresno were mostly green
and sold slowly at easier rates, while offer-
Ings from other sections moved freely at good
prices. Stocks of Watermelons were light and
prices were well maintained. Red Nectarines
were lower at $1 per crate, while the white
variety were awaiting a buyer at any price.
Receipts of Blackberries were suddenly heavy
and lnclvdcd a great many . chests of poor
quality from the Sebastopol region, which
dragged at the minimum quotation. The other

Boston Wool Market.
BOSTON. July 19. â There is a heavy de
mand in the wool market, with trading marked
by something of a feverish tone. This Is
due to the desire of dealers and users to con
trol the latest clips at tha lowest prices which
the high market affords. There Is a general
buying of territory wools, especially Al me

there recorded were calculated to reassure
fears of damage or Its extent to winter wheat,
while other crops were practically unaffected
by any adverse conditions. The rejection by
the majority of the directors of the Northern
Securities of what seemed like a conciliatory
advance on behalf of the Harriman Interests
offers no other surface explanation than to dis
credit the recently prevailing rumors of . the
likelihood of a settlement out of court by
compromise of the dispute over the manner
of distribution of assets of the corporation.
But the market accorded a cheerful reception
to the news and made a vigorous recovery of
the early declines. The grain and cotton car
riers led the rally with Atehison In the van
and gains of 1 to 1% were established in dif
ferent members of these groups in the final
hour of the trading. The close was strong
and active.
Bonds were Irregular. Total sales, par
value. $2,600,000.
United States bonds were unchanged on call.

Extensive alterations have been
made in the building and equipment
at the Cogswell Polytechnic College
during the summer vacation. A one
story brick building has been erected
to be used for a forgeshop and foun
dry. The chemical laboratory has
been transferred to a larger room and
smaller laboratories have been added
for advanced work in Industrial chem
istry. A special feature of the work
in applied chemistry is a course in
mineralogy- and assaying. This course
is open to students who have had two
years of high school work and to a
limited number of special students
who have had required work In gen
eral chemistry.
Robert W. Dodd, A. M.', formerly
instructor in chemistry and assaying
at Stanford University, has been se
cured to take charge of this work.
Professor Dodd is a veteran of the
Spanish-American War, having served
with the First California volunteers in
the Philippine Islands. He is a mem
ber of the Sigma Psl fraternity, an or
ganization composed exclusively of
men of scientific ability. His success
ful work in the Stanford assaying
laboratory assures the proper develop
ment of the new course at Cogswell.
The department of sewing and
dressmaking has been removed to more
commodious quarters, which will add
greatly to the convenience and success
of this now popular department.
The new term opens for advanced
students on Monday, July 25, and for
the new classes on Wednesday, July 27.
Professor Dodd, Formerly of Stanford
University, Will Conduct a New
Course in Assaying.

that an attempt had been made to

that "in a criminal action they will
never be able to obtain a final de
termination of the question."
The latter averment is a slap at the
judicial honor of Judge Fritz and in
line with the charge made by Attor

Judge Troutt will hear more of the
case to-day.
over the couch and floor. A pocket
knife, also covered with blood, lay on
the table. On a stand was a bottle
partly filled with' carbolic acid. He had
used both the knife and poison in his
efforts to kill himself.
Peterson was removed to the Re
ceiving Hospital and treated for car
bolic acid poisoning. At a late hour
last night he was in a semi-conscious
state, writhing and gasping with pain
from the gash in his throat and the
acid he had drunk.
Peterson's brother missionaries are
James Silver. R. W. Young, H. Stevens
and D. H. Wood. They have been for
several years in the Antipodes,' learn
ing the native language and laboring
in the service of the Church of the
Latter Day Saints. Their work has
principally been among the Maoris, the
natives of New Zealand. The Mor
mon church keeps about 2500 young
preachers . in the foreign missionary
field. In fact, every young man of the
faith, unless he has a pull ' with ! the
Mormon hierarchy, may be called on
for such work. There is no holding
back when, a summons comes to depart.
An ordfiT from "Box B," as the official
notification of the church is known in
Utah, is to them a voice from heaven.
To hear is to obey.
Andrew C. Peterson was living at
Fairvlew, Sanpete County, Utah, with
his wife and child six months ago,
when he was ordered to far New Zea
land. He was not strong and not even
the dry, saline air of the Salt Lake
country could . bring perfect health to
his weak lungs. Sanpete County of
Utah is peopled by Swedish converts
of the church and these disciples of
the Scandinavian race are a part of
the pillars of the faith.
Arriving, at Auckland, Peterson be
gan the study of the Maori language.
The tongue was lettered and gram
mared years ago by pioneer mission
aries. It is one of the most difficult of
all languages that have been rounded
up from the brush of savagery and
tamed to live peacefully in .books. Its
alphabet has fifteen lettersâ about one
third too fewâ its syntax is a night
mare arid every part of speech has to
do quadruple duty and work overtime
at that. A verbal expression begins at
the punctuation point and ends at the
capital letter. If one speaks to a Maori
with just , the right shade of voice
inflection at the finish of the last word,
he and all he possesses is -the speak
er's, but if one* varies a hair's breadth
the.' tone the speaker: is war clubbed.
WEIGHED AND FOUND WANTING.
Poor Peterson with his frail body be
gan this, heavy task and.it broke him
down. He could not master the Maori
tongue. | The damp, raw Antarctic at
mosphere in his frail lung cells did the
rest. His spirits as well as his health
failed. Others around hlmV^ talked
fluently with the big friendly . natives.
Why could not he? It was as a death
blow, when the elder of his conference
in Auckland ordered him home as unfit
for the service. To preach the gospel
to the heathen in the darkness of the
distant Southeastern world was his
life and he had fallen at the outset.
He could not be one of the valiant host
sent yearly to carry the word of his
church into the, uttermost parts of the
earth. In Sanpete, among his strong

Prosecution Alleges That
Balances on Firm's Books
Were Regularly Forced
Judge Lawlor yesterday ruled that
expert medical opinions as to the phys
ical condition of Jacob Eppinger could
not enter into the trial of the case.
This was a strong blow to the defense
and was delivered after the question
had been argued pro and con for sev
eral hours.-
Almost the^ entire day and a portion
,of the night session was taken up in
arguments regarding the admissibility
of certain lines of evidence. The prose
cution sought to show that the books
of the firm had been falsified under
the direction of Jacob Eppinger, but
the direct ! questions regarding this
matter were objected to on technical
grounds, and the objections sustained.
The defense again sought to show the
magnitude. of the business of the firm
and the prosecution countered by as
serting that balances on the books
were foiced. All efforts to prove this
were unavailing, however, as the wit
ness, Frank Mitchell, was under cross
examination and the court ruled that
he could only.be examined regarding
grain transactions.
Mitchell was the first witness called
in the morning and he testified that
the sales of grain for the year ending
June 1, 1903. aggregated $1,925,612 52,
and the reduction of the indebtedness
of the firm was made through sales
of grain.
"What was' the sum total of indebt
edness on May 31?" was asked.
"One million two hundred and fifty
eight thousand three hundred and sev
enty-two dollars and thirty cents," was
the reply.
"Does that ledger show correctly the
volume of business and the cash de
posits?" asked Attorney Campbell.
This question gave rise to a storm
of objections, in the course of which
Attorney Campbell said: "We can
prove that a $274,000 balance was
forced at .the direction of Jacob Ep
pinger and that sales were entered on
the books which were never made\"
To this Attorney Ach sarcastically
replied: "To what straits is the prose
cution led when it seeks not only to
besmirch the character of this defend
ant, but accuse him of defrauding his
business partners."
Attorney Campbell then asked a se
ries of questions seeking to show that
balances had been forced and favors
shown to the Londoli, Paris and Amer
ican Bank. The questions were ob
jected to and the objections were sus
tained by the court.
When questioned as to how he esti
mated the business of the firm at from
$6,000,000 to $10,000,000 a year, the wit
ness said he added the purchases and
sales together and his figures were the
result of this computation. So far as
the books were concerned, he received
his figures from Topping and knew
nothing of their" accuracy further than
that he presumed them to be correct.
A The case goes on again at ten o'clock
this morning.
Scandinavian people, he would be only
a broken-down teacherâ a missionary
who had failed. Seasickness on the
homeward voyage added to his illness
and he made the trip up from Auck
land in misery and almost in silence
until he landed here.
Then he . wandered off alone, found
a place away from his comrades, away
from the world that condemned him
as useless, and sought to finish the life
that failed.
Governor Charles N. Herried of South
Dakota, accompanied by his daughter,
Grace Herried. and a party of friends,
who are to attend the launching of the
new United States cruiser South Da
kota to-morrow, arrived in this city
last eveuins and are registered at the
Palace Hotel.
The party includes, besides the Gov
ernor and his daughter. George W.
Nash. Superintendent of Public In
struction of South Dakota, and his
wife, James Brown, Code Commission
er of the same State, and Mrs. Brown,
Miss Alda. Johnson, a friend of Miss
Herried. and Frank Crane, clerk of the
Supreme Conrt and chairman of the.
Republican State Central Committee of
South Dakota, and his wife.
The launching of the new cruiser has
been set for a late hour to-morrow in
order that the full advantage of the
tides may be obtained. ; Upon Miss
Grace Herried has been conferred the
honor of christening the vessel, which

Herrled's party in San Francisco is to
be a short one, for it is their plan to
leave Friday morning for Portland, and
from there they will proceed back to
South Dakota by way of the Northern
Pacific.
After this ignominy Sullivan alleges
that he is advised and believes "that
in a criminal action against the
As an exhibit to the affidavit is at
tached Judge Murasky's decision deny
ing the application of the United Rail
roads for an injunction to prevent the
house movers from cutting its electric
wires. . In the decision the Judge hild
that the business of house moving was
as legitimate as that of street railroads
and that, because of the number of
frame buildings here, conditions are
different from those in any other place
in the United States. , Judge Murasky
held that the house movers had a right
to cut wires but must do so at the
convenience of the corporation and
must defray the cost.
Sullivan's affidavit says that the
house movers object to the demand of
the corporation for a deposit as a con
dition precedent to the moving of
houses through the wires. It is also
set forth that seventeen firms are en
gaged in the 'house moving business
and they employ ten or more men each.
Getting down to the matter of ar
rests, Sullivan says that he was ar
rested on May 9, 1904, and taken to
police headquarters, for cutting wires.
He was again arrested and the officer
appeared to be angry because Sulli
van had succeeded in cutting the wires,
and proposed to call the "Black
Maria." However, Sullivan was taken
to jail in a street car and gave $125
bonds for his appearance. Then it is
charged that the hearing was delayed
and that the company did not appear
against him, but finally Judge Fritz
held him for trial.
CANXOT GET JUSTICE.
Arguments were heard yesterday by
Judge Troutt in the case wherein D.
J Sullivan and other house movers
seek an injunction to prevent the Po
lice Department and the San Francisco
Gas and Electric Company from arrest
ing the men engaged in moving houses
and incidentally cutting the wires of the
lighting company. "While Sullivan's at
torney, (?. "W. Eastln, was presenting
his case ' to the court a small sensa
tion was developed in his charge that
"the Police Department, its chief and
his officers, and the Judges of the Po
lice Court are subservient to the re
quests and interests of the gas com
pany." Naturally more regarding the
charge was looked for and it appeared,
hidden In legal verbiage, in an affidavit
filed by Sullivan during the afternoon.
. The affidavit recited that up to the
time of the passage of section 593 of
the Penal Code, relating to the ma
licious cutting of wires, the house
movers were never required to make a
deposit to cover the cost of cutting the
wires of the lighting or railway'com
panies. After the passage of the act
the gas and other companies made the
demand from some of the house movers
and not from others. The plaintiffs
claim that they are not legally liable
for such deposits and aver that the
charges of the corporations have not
been uniform. Furthermore, it is de
clared that the house movers have had
nothing to say regarding the costs to
be charged. It is said, too, that the
house movers % have always notified the
corporation as to the moment the house
movers would reach its wires and were
willing to accommodate themselves to
the company's convenience in moving
through the lines.
