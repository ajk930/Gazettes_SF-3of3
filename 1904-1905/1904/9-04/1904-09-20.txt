the general opinion of members of the

At the head of the. long column that
marched two abreast . down Market
street and over Mason to Native Sons'
Hall was the strikingly uniformed
body of the San Francisco Canton,
headed by the band. The men in uni
form presented- a fine appearance as
they -lined up before' the hall with
swords at- salute, while the grand rep
resentatives filed past them. Into the
building.
Sharply at , 11 o'clock Grand Sire
John B. Goodwin rapped for order and
the body, began its deliberations. The
session opened: with a short prayer by
the temporary grand' chaplain, the
Rev. Peter 'A. Simpkins of :Utah, who
nils the, office made temporarily va
cant by the absence of Grand Chaplain
J.' W. Venable.-, The Rev. J. W. Ven
able - has â¢ been grand chaplain of. the
order for many years' and was unable

. Escorted by the San Francisco Can

grand representatives to the Sovereign
Grand Lodge of the Independent Or

dered a reception, to Native Sons'
Hall, where the Sovereign Grand
Lodge will hold its executive sessions
throughout the week. Upon these de
liberations will depend the course of
the Odd Fellows throughout the
United States for the next two years.
The results of yesterday's delibera
tions were the calling to order of the
eightieth annual session, the appoint
ment of a temporary deputy grand sire
and temporary grand chaplain, the
seating of new representatives and the
apportioning of work to the various
committees. Â¦'->"
ing, with Conway second, though not
very far ahead of. the Western candi
date, who is sure to hold the balance
of power. The friends of both Nolan
and Kuykendall are opposing Conway*s
aspirations,' and at present it looks as
if it will be impossible for him to win.
Few cf the men of '65 are with us to-day
and yet a* one of those few I cave, the great
nrlvilers and honor on behalf of the Grand
Encampment of California and the patriarchs
of this golden land by the mighty Pacific, of
extending to you a welcome to our : Jurisdic
tion, our hearts and our â¢ homes.
l<fke the Journey of the pilgrims which you
have seen Illustrated yon have crossed deserts
and mountains, passed through rocky genres
and traversed - the wilderness, - but i now you
are la glorious, unapproachable, unequaled
California, the land of the orange and olive:
wiÂ«re you can sit beneath the fig trees. and
look out upon Illimitable fields of golden grain:
wbere the tents of- the patriarchs are pitched
la the ehadows of towering mountains .which
seem to rÂ»ror> the skies and bear the heavens
upon their uplifted- shoulders: 'beneath ma
jestic trees which were growing when this
old world was young : - in rertons , wbere thun
dering cascades and : waterfalls ' sound ever
lartln: anthems , to their : great Creator; Â». and
axaia where - tropical - flowers and plants fill
Around that altar, at that time, those men
pledged their best and ceaseless efforts
for the onward progress of our order, whose
voice th* roar of artillery had failed to si
lence, whose silken ties the sword had been
powerless to sever. And they have kept their
word. The SOO.OT) members of , that time
have added more than 1.000.000 to' their num
bers. Wherever civilisation has extended its
footsteps or Christianity erected Its throne
the three links are *"?eo and the click of the
gavel of American Odd Fellowship falls like
music en the traveler's ear.
FEW ARE LEFT.
Thirty-nine years ago to-day, after four
years of tfaa most terrible war the world
had ever known, after four years of anxiety
and absence, at -the call of Grand Eire Veltch
the Southern Etates sent up their represent
atives to Baltimore, Md. They knew not what
their reception might be. but strong la the
faith, and relying on the durability of the
obligations that had been taken by all around
a common altar, they felt assured of a true
fraternal greeting. And a welcome was given
and a scene enacted unparalleled In the his
tory of a fraternity.
Kennedy, Moore, Ellison. Oralghead 1 , Sher
lock. Nicholson. Veitch, Banders. LAmberton,
Btokes, Stuart. Farnsworth, White, Carey and
m. hundred others were there, who with elo
quent voices, tear-dimmed eyes and hearty
nand-ciaxra rejoiced over the return of those
so lorz absent from the fold.
On behalf cf the Grand Encampment
William H. Barnes made the oration
of the day. He spoke as follows: fjj
only do the Odd Fellows, but the 17,000
Rebekahs unite with us in bidding you wel
come.

name of all the crand officers Â¦ our thanks to
the people of California. . We; feel that we
made no mistake when we selected California
for oar grand encampment. We have '- been
welcomed by your chief municipal officer, by
the officer* of the Grand Lodge of California
and by our sisters, the Rebekahs. Under these
circumstances there Is surely a week of happi

Fellows have been pioneers. In civilization
, The response to the cordial welcom
ing .speeches -was : made by John B.
Goodwin, .grand sire for. the United
States. In introducing him 'the chair
man made a slight mistake -which
caused considerable merriment.. He Â¦ re
ferred to : him as "grand;- sire Â¦' of u the.
State of California." As Goodwin* comes
from Georgia, and as his Jurisdiction
extends over the entire country, \ he
made the.'most of the blunder and-ac
cused the chairman of not only want
ing to claim- all the climate,' gold, fruit
and flowers for the. State, but-.that-he
was not averse, to laying" hands on
anything else that was good. In part
Grand Sire".Goodwin,said: â¢

The bell tapped the hour, 8 o'clock,
and the Pavilion was crowded from
gallery to main floor.
Some said that 6000 were there, and
this came near the truth. There were
Odd Fellows and Rebekahs at every
nook and crook of the great building,
and good fellowship, that was by no
means odd in view of the genial spirits
who had a heartv welcome and a
heartier handshake for all.
The opening ceremonies of the Grand
Encampment were certainly successful.
The arrangements were all that could
be desired, and it waa a foregone con
clusion that the visitors from all parts
of the East and the coast were satis
fied that the brethren In San Francisco
had left no stone unturned to make for
them a good time â and a lengthy pe
riod of it.
Professor Sarvell's chorus of 600
voices followed the Introductory mu
sical selection of the orchestra. The
great combination of trained voices
could not have done better. The sing
ers were at their best, and at the stroke
of the baton and a wave at the leader's
hand they sang:
Here we welcome, here we welcome.
We welcome you, we welcome you!
The sovereign ruler of our noble band of , mil
lions!
From every nation, from every strand, J:
From the mountains, valleys, deserts, mead

I TO-DAY'S SESSION.
' The most important feature of to
! day's session will be the election of new
i officers of the Sovereign Grand Lodge
I for the ensuing two years. Fol-
I lowing the election of officers the
' session will hear the reports of the
I committees appointed yesterday and
I act on the other routine business of the
day. On Saturday the installation of
officers for the ensuing two years will
take place, after which the eightieth
session will come to an end.
The arrangements made by the Odd
Fellows for the decoration of their con
i vention hall have been very elaborate.
1 A supply of new desks, one for each
member of the Sovereign Grand Lodge,
with the name of the State whence he
comes, gives the hall a businesslike ap
pearance. On the stage are placed three
chairs of state, which are occupied by
the presiding officers, while the record
ing officers are placed on a raised plat
form in the auditorium a few -inches
below the level of the stage. On this
platform are placed the desks of the
secretary and his officers, and by this
arrangement a clear view of the entire
hall is afforded to all the officers. An
act of thoughtfulness that was appre
ciated by the visitors was the placing
of a basket of fruit on the desk of each
representative. Throughout the session
the members were able to refresh them
selves with the California fruit, and
many expressions of appreciation were
heard. Another feature of the decora
tion of the hall was the arrangement of
flags of the various countries in,
which there are branches of the order.
These, made of silk and of large pro
' portions, are the property of the Sov
ereign Grand Lodge.
Continued From Page "T, 'Column "T.
Grand Sire Goodwin explained the
purposes of Odd Fellowship, and made
so clear the benefits that are to be de
rived from membership that it was
common expression among those who
listened to him that he had "made con
verts to the cause."
After Grand Sire Goodwin's address
Miss Lulu Purlenky sang a contralto
solo, "Let Me Love Thee." Miss Pur
lenky made a hit at both the afternoon
and evening entertainments. Her voice
Is pewerful and well trained and her
rendition of Arditi's difficult composi
tion was all that the most exacting
critic could expect.
Grand Master John W. Linscott of
California; addressed the brothers on
the advance of Odd Fellowship. He fol
lowed on the lines drawn by Grand
Sire Goodwin and gave much interest
ing data concerning the work of the
order. He was , listened to attentively
and gave way to Past Grand Master
William H/ Barnes of San Francisco,
who is known "from Maine to Southern
California and â¢ from Washington to
Florida."
Everybody who is an Odd Fellow in
California knows "Brother Barnes" â
better than the men from Maine, of,
course â so when he appeared at the
front of the platform there burst forth
a cheer that had the right ring' In it.
Mr. Barn e3 gave sime interesting fig
ures concerning the, status of the ordet
in California; He told of the days when
he first thought of joining the Odd
Fellows, and of the subsequent pleasure
derived from being brought within the
scope of its world-wide influence for
good. Decades have passed and his
tory has been made since he placed
his hand upon the links, but no better
history could have been created from
an Odd Fellow's point of view than
that evolved with the years that have
added strength to Americanism, and,
as a natural consequence, to all well
founded fraternal organizations.
Following Brother Barnes' address
Robert W. Jones, a barytone with a
pleasing voice, rendered "Queen- of
the Earth," by Pinsuti. He was en
cored several times. The chorus sang
the "Gloria," from the "Twelfth Mass"
of Mozart, and the orchestra ended
the evening's programme with a
march by Sousa.
Considering that a very small 'per- |
centage of the visiting Odd, Fellows
were able to attend the afternoon en
tertainment at the Pavilion it is sur
prising that nearly 3000 persons pass'
ed the entrances between the hours of
2 and 5 o'clock. Vocal and instru-"
mental music was the programme, but
in the galleries and the reception- (
rooms on the main floor the cantons |
were too busy to give attention to the
concert San Joaquin, Pacific Grove, ;
Santa Cruz No. 33, San Francisco drill
corps of Rebekahs and Contra Costa
entertained visitors and got their
headquarters in shape. San Jose came
in during the afternoon with thirty
members and prepared to camp in the
north wing of the. gallery. Stockton
took charge at the San Joaquin head-
duCed Grand Sire John B. ' Goodwin',
who was enthusiastically received by
the gTeat audience. Grand Sire Good
win -spoke in a clear," strong voice,
heard in all parts of the building. He
told of the noble work of the Odd Fel
lows, their- rapid growth throughout
not only the United States, but all the
countries .of the. world. The order to
day, has a membership of 1,446,000, and
to this vast number hundreds are added
dally, r ' -
When disaster has overtaken cities
and .towns of Â¦ the United States the
Odd Fellows and the Rebekahs have
been- in the fore among the societies
that have administered to the sick and
helpless, the . fatherless and mother
less. When the Americans conquered
in the Philippines it was not many
days before the organization had
spread in the new possessions and
gained a foothold among civilians and
soldiers. Even in South Africa, with
Boer and British, the order was strong
and /far reaching and on the battle
field the link of friendship, love and
truth rtot even cold steel or bursting
shells could sever.
The speaker was frequently, inter
rupted by applause. To the right and
left of him were the officers of the
Sovereign Grand Lodge and in front
of him were a noble 600 of visiting
comrades. From this nucleus of faith
ful supporters of the order the cheers
of approval spread to every part of
the audience.

LILIES OF lULn UNO BEAUTY.
In a recent interview with Mre. Lily
I<an?trT, she very wisely said :
"The fact that I believe iu the superior
force of mind over matter does not blind
me to the truth that the foundation of every
successful life is good health; that the key-
stone to physical beauty is perfect physical
health.
"A sick woman cannot be a beautiful
woman, nor can she be anything but what
we English call a poor-spirited woman.
"To a great extent a woman's beauty is
measured by her vitalityâ by her health.
*Work, Sunshine, Exercise, Water and
Soap, Plain, Nourishing Food, Lots of
Fresh Air, and a Happy, Contented Spirit
â there, as you say, 'honest and true,' is
my working-rule for youth, youthful spirits
and youthful looks."
One great secret of youth and beauty for
the young woman or the mother is the
proper understanding of her womanly sys-
tem and well-being. Every woman, young
or old, should know herself 2nd. her phys-
ical make-up. A good way to arrive at this
knowledge is to get a good . doctor" book,
such for instance as "The People's Common
Sense Medical Adviser," by R. V. Pierce,
M. p., which can readily be procured by
sending twenty - one cents in one - cent
stamps for paper-bound volume, or thirty-
one cents for cloth-bound copy, and ad-
dressing Dr. R. V. Pierce, Buffalo, N. Y.
"Dr. Picrce's Favorite Prescription can always
be relied upon to cure when everything else
fails," writes Mrs. Dr. Nielsen, of 430a Langley â¢
Avenue, Chicago, Ills. "It is a certain cure for
female troubles, diseases in their worst forms.
I suffered for years with ' ulceration, intense
pains and a dreadful backache, which unfitted
me for my work. Finally I grew so HI had to
keep to my bed. In this extremity I u*cd ' Pa-
vorite Prescription â¢ for three months and then
I was well. Only tho? e who have passed
through such a siege of sickness as I have will
understand how much I value Dr. Pierce's Fa-
vorite Prescription."
Dr. Pierce offers $500 reward for any case
of Leucorrhea, Female Weakness, Prolap-
sus, or Falling of Womb which he cannot
cure. All he asks is a fair and reasonable
trial of his means of cure. , No substitute ',
for "Favorite Prescription ". offers so much.

Llt-utenant General Line'vltch probably will be

Japanese bravery as fanatical, and says:
"During the etnking of the Japanese trans
ports by the Vladivostok squadron it was al
most Impossible to save their crews. At one
time tile water around the cruiser was filled
with a thousand Japanese, who sank rather
than be rescued. Two were thrown a rope,
which fell across them, but they deliberately
threw off the rope and sank, shaking their
fists at the Russians."

LONDON, Sept. 19. â Russia's reply
to the British protest on the subject
of Russia's Interpretation of contra
band of war' Includes a decision to re
spect the British demand Jn the case
of the British steamship Knight Com
mander, (sunk by the Vladivostok
squadron off Isu and afterward ad-
Judged a lawful prize). It is under
stood that -Russia- upholds the prin
siple that Admiral Jensen was justified
in sinking the steamship. The British
Government is still hopeful of a set
tlement by means of an Indemnity,
but in view of the decision of the prize
court at Vladivostok it Is said, that
Russia does not see how she can com
ply with the British r demand, as she
thereby would recognize her officers
to be at fault. This question will be
the subject of further negotiations be
tween the two Governments, the Brit
ish authorities appreciating the fact
that Russia has made a substantial
concession in- differentiating between
conditional and absolute contraband.
PORTLAND, Or., Sept. 19.^ â The
Telegram says advices have been,re
ceived from, a San -Francisco firm of
underwriters, that the Russian Gov
ernment" will pay " all claims of. Port
land shippers arising, from the seizure
of flour on the â¢ German . steamship

ments - of > their ; losses, together . with
It Is understood that private assur
ances have been given the United
States that the American Government
will be satisfied with the manner in
which the contraband rules will , be
interpreted hereafter.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 19. â The
Russian construction placed upon the
contraband regulations is eminently
gratifying to the State Department of
ficials and it is directly in line with
their contention. The result will be
to firmly -establish as a principle of
international law the exemption of
foodstuffs conveyed under the condi
tions described from seizure, a matter
which heretofore has not been one of
universal practice. The burden of
proof as to the contraband character
of the goods" is, for the first time,
placed squarely upon the naval com
manders attempting to make the seiz
ures and, if the ship's papers are reg
ular, the shipper would be regarded
as having established prima facie the
non-contraband of his shipment, j This
is regarded- as of great importance to
commercial interests. â¢-<.,.:.
Russia will not undertake at this
stage to interfere with the cases of
the steamships Arabia and Calchas. of
which the courts have already taken
jurisdiction and in which the Vladi
vostok court found the facts, but upon
appeal the admiralty court will apply
its interpretation of section 10, which
practically amounts to an assurance
that the flour, etc., seized will then be
released.
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 19. â The
Russian answer to the American notes
in regard to contraband of war, as
specifically raised in the cases of the
British steamship Calchas and the
Portland and Asiatic line steamship
Arabia (both captured by the Vladi
vostok squadron, the former while
bound from Puget Sound ports to Jap
an) has been delivered. It follows gen
erally the lines of the reply to Great
Britain. On the broad question In
volved Russia recognizes the principle
of the immunity of innocem trade
with Japanese ports, but she holds to
her right to stop contraband destined
for the use of the Japanese military
or naval forces. The circumstances of
each case will to a certain extent gov
ern it.

still massing at Yentai and Bentzia
putze. No Japanese have been discov
ered east of the latter point. The re
connaissances, General Kuropatkin
says, were brilliantly carried out by
Generals Samsonoff's and Rennen
kampffs Cossack brigades, - with a
mixed detachment of Infantry and ar
tillery, under RennenkampfTs personal
command. They covered a village north
of Bentziaputze. which was used as a
pivot. The Russians drew off later,
losing a few men killed or wounded,
after securing valuable information re
garding the Japanese strength and po
sition.
General Kuropatkin says he reviewed
yesterday the Thirty-seventh Division,
commanded by General Chekmareff,
which had then just arrived at Muk
den. It belongs to the First European
Corps, of which the Twenty-second Di
vision. General â¢ Fanasovitch, reached
Liaoyang in time to take part in the
battle there. The appearance of the
newly arrived European troops at Muk
den, instead of being evidence of the
complete Russian concentration there*
as many persons hastily assumed, is
more likely due to the desire of Gen
eral Kurapatkin to get these fresh and
untested troops into contact with the
Japanese and give the soldiers who suf
fered the brunt of the fighting at Liao
yang an opportunity to rest and re
cuperate.
Kuropatkin has ordered the Issue of
heavy winter clothing in the middle of
October. The Russian troops have al
ready exchanged their summer khaki
for their ordinary cloth uniforms.
It is said that the order has aroused great
discontent. Whole regiments are anxious to go
to the theater of war. but the officer* intensely
dislike the prospect of the organizations being
ITlit up. ' .
ST. PETERSBURG, Sept. 20.â There Ja a
story afloat that a sudden call has been Issued
to officers of the guard regiments stationed
in St. Petersburg to report for service at the
front. According to n-port the order directs
that sLx officers of each regiment should be
chosen by lot and drafted to serve with regi
ments now in the Far East.

ADVANCING UPON' MTKDEX.
The strictest pessible guard Is kept
around the Lena, and only those In au
thority on the island and those who are
invited by Captain Berlinsky are per
mitted on board.
Regarding the final disposition of the
crew. Admiral McCalla was unable to
make any statement. "The disposition
of the Lena's crew," he said, "rested
with the department in Washington."
In the meantime the officers appear
contented and the crew look happy and
smiling.
Captain Berlinsky, accompanied by a
number of his officers, called on Ad
miral and Mrs. McCalla at their quar
ters on Saturday. They received a most
hoppitabl* welcome.
The best of good fellowship seems to
pxist between the men on the Lena and
the men stationed on the different war
ships at the island. The men on the
Lena are allowed to go on shore within
a prescribed limit at the will of their
commander*. Captain Berlinsky and
his officers are on parole and can go to
and from the ship as suits their inclina
tions. They cannot, however, accord
ing to the neutrality laws, go farther
than San Francisco and. Its environ
ments.
Every evening at 8 o'clock the entire
crew of the Lena assembles on the for
ward deck, where prayers are said and
hymns are sung. The Russian national
anthem. "God Save the Czar," ends the
day on the Lena.

Captain Bcrlinsky* paced the forward

ment was going on. He said, however,
that he wished to make the statement
that he was highly pleased with the
courtesy shown him and those on board
hi? veFsel by all the officials since his
arrival in this port. Since his ship had
been docked at Mare Island, he said, he
had received the greatest consideration
from Admiral McCalla and the officers
of the admiral's staff. He wanted them
all to know that he appreciated the
courtesies shown him.

BACK TO THE TREASURY
The Western Pacific management, wishing
to establish friendly relations with the < JouM
and Hawley lines, elected a Gould director
in Edwin T. JefTery, president of the Denver
and Rio Grande.
Wall street popularly believes that the
Western Pacific Is a Gould proposition and
will so develop when the enterprise has reached
a more tangible shape than at present.
NEW YORK. Sept. %0.â Edwin Hawley**
election to the directorate of 'the Western Pa
cific suggests In the nflnds of many the likeli
hood of an alliance between the Western.Pa
cific and tha Colorado Southern. In which the
Hawley Interests are dominant.
No explanation of his election to the West
ern Pacific board was given by Hawley. It
was pointed out, however, by Interests con
nected with the Western Pacific that th-> Den
ver and : Rio Grande reaches Salt Lake, tha
terminus of the Western Pacific, and the Den
ver and Rio Grande, with the Colorado South
ern, controls the Colorado Midland.

A Test Case in Kansas.
Congressmen and Senators from all
over the United Statea will watch
closely the election returns from tha
Seventh Kansas District this fall. It
will be a test case aa to- -what Govern

Besides his regular apportionment of
12,000 packages, Congressman Murdocl:
has talked other congressmen out of
10,000 packages. Senator Long and Con
gressman at Large Scott have also dis
tributed part of their apportionment in

ages contains five smaller packages.â

It was in February last that John
Sharp Williams' leadership of the mi
nority in the House of Representatives
had so spread his fame that he was
widely talked about as of Presidential
caliber. An enterprising but unsophis
ticated young newspaper man sought
the Mississipplan for information as 'to
any movement in his favor. Mr. Wil
liams, with well dissembled gravity, as
sured the reporter that everything was
auspicious for his boom. Recent reports
from Mississippi especially were highly
encouraging.
"Toomsuba, Ofanoma, Noxopater,
Nanachehaw, Toccopola, Tabbvilleand
Grubbs Springs, I am told," he said,
"are already for me, while I have every
reason to believe that I shall have the
undivided support of such places as
Nittayuma, Wahalak, Bolatusha, Hush
pukena, Pelahatchles, Mittayuma, Es
tabutchee, Ittabena, Scutch, Cinqupin,
Pawtickfaw, Octoc, Leggo, Yellow Rab
bit, Chunkey Station, Hambone, Deovo
lente and Whynot."
When the reporter had sufficiently re
covered to scrutinize the countenance
of the Mississippi statesman he asked:
"How do you spell those?"
Mr. Williams patiently and with dig
nified deliberation spelled the words.
The reporter took it all down and went
away with a quizzical look, almost as
quizzical as that with which the minor
ity leader disappeared within the swing
ing doors of the House. â Harper's

â¢ It Is the fate of the strong man to make
enemies The very attributes of character
which lift him above the ordinary level create
an opposition that la always too bitter to do
him Justice. Weak men also arouse opposition,
but it 1b of the kind that despises rather than
hates. The difference la due to the fact that
the strong man fights after the manner of a
valiant soldier, pressing straight onward to
the goal and forcing obstacles aside as he
advances, while the weak man .zigzags along,
making detours and resorting to tricks to save
himself from being driven back Into the ob
scurity he merits.
At this time one of tho strong men of the
United States Is the nominee of a great party
for President. His name is Theodore Roose
velt. As a Police Commissioner of New York
city, as Governor of New York State, as Vlce-
Presldent of the United States and as President
he has proved his strength. He has made
enemies, and his enemies are a credit to htm.
If the men and Interests who are now fight
ing him were his friends their support would
make him less worthy of the confidence of the
people.
OAKLAND, Sept. 19. â Alameda
County now has but one Democratic
newspaper. Formerly there were
double that number, but Daniel Mc-
Carthy, proprietor and editor of the
San Leandro Reporter, has decided to
support President Roosevelt in the
Presidential campaign, 'leaving: the
Livermore Herald, owned by A. L.
Henry, the only Democratic paper 1 .,' In
the county.
â¢Ever since the establishment of the
San Leandro â¢ Reporter Mr. McCarthy
has been a stanch'champlon of the

The marriage of Mies Hooper and Mr. Creed

place at the Hooper home In Alameda, Mrs.
Sumner Crosby, the bride's only sister, will

affair, will be of widespread interest oyrlng
to the social prominence of both families.

party. # # ;
OAKLAND, Sept. 19. â The round of social
entertainment is necessarily monotonous. Cus
tom ' designs the pattern and only the uncon
ventional . dare stray from the Bet outlines-
But occasionally tbe fashionable set Introduces
an Innovation that meets with" general ap
proval ; Newport has given us the "dinner
dance," a ?orm~6f entertaining .welcomed by
the hostess; who has a beautiful- home, a rest
less hospitality .and ample, means with which
to gratify .her. aspirations.' Just now the din
ner dance Is. the thing and thÂ« first to follow
this pleasant Innovation is .Mrs. . A. L. Stone,
who entertained- in this happy fashion this
evening in hpnor of Mis? -May Young and her
fiance. ; Dr. Thomas R.eld McNab.
The :A. -L. Storties'^.house.'on Veraon Heights
Is one. of the very artistic- homes of Oakland
and presented a luxurious picture this evening.
Sixteen .guests, including Miss Young's bridal
party, were seated about the large oval table.
A great basket of pink Bridesmaid roses occu
pied the* center of the- table, â¢ while streamers
of pink tulle wound through the gleaming ser
vice and silver candelabra. The dinner guests
were Miss Young and Dr. McNab, Miss Bertha
Young. Miss Anne McNab. Miss Anita Oliver,
Miss Marietta Havens,* Miss Carolyn Oliver,
Miss Havemeyer, Miss Bertha McElrath, John
McNab, Dr. Allaneon Weeks. Dr. Benjamin
Bakewell. Russell Taylor, Vail Bakewell, Sid

The dinner party was joined later by those
invited to the d&noe to the number of forty or
fifty. The ballroom was beautifully decorated
with blue and yellow chrysanthemums.
In spite of the fact that she has been feted
so much Mies Young is looking extremely well
and will undoubtedly fulfill her friends' prog
nostications that she will make a lovely bride.
It is a great temptation not to till about that
exquisite bridal eown now. It Is a rich, soft
cream in color and the bridesmaids are all to
be in blue â "picture gowns" Â¦ describes them
best. The happy little bride-to-be has already
received a great number of the most gorgeous
gifts from far and near.

DINNER DANCE
SARATOGA. N. Y., Sept 10.â The majority
of the 430 delegates who will constitute the
Democratic State Convention, called to meet
here at noon to-morrow, are In Saratoga, The
net result of to-day's developments is the se
lection of Duncan Campbell Lee of Ithaca to
be permanent chairman of the convention and
George Raines of Rochester to be chairman of
the committee on resolutions.
Otherwise, according to the most authorita
tive information obtainable to-night, thÂ« sit
uation utands as it stood last Thursday night
Â¦when Judge Parker left New' York City after
his series of conferences with various leaders.
It is the general Impression that agreements
will be reached and the question of the nomi
nation for the Governorship settled in confer
ence, so that only one name shall be presented
to the convention and the nomination be made
unanimously.
There is no diminution in the undercurrent
of feeling, which has been In evidence since
tho delegates began to gather, that unless some
compromise become necessary the convention
will nominate Edward M. Shepard of Brook
lyn. The belief is prevalent that Shepard has
the support of the nationa 1 leaders and this
gives strength to the Shepard movement.
Senator McCarren to-day declared himself
unalterably opposed to the nomination of
Shepard and announced without qualification
that -If Shepard. be nominated it must be with
out the aid or consent of Kings County. .

Mayor Olney to-<lay issued a state
ment in regard to the proposed bond
issue. He based his statement upon
aa examination of the proposed Cen
tral Park site made by him this morn
ing and he denounced the effort to
stampede the voters against the bonds.
Mayor Olney has an agreement from
the Realty Syndicate to get all of the
tract ct actual cost.
This is Mayor Olney's official.state
ment in full:
To the People of Oakland: I don't believe
the voters of Oakland can* be stampeded by
tha statements that we are to pay too much
for tbe land for a central park. I have JuÂ«t
gonÂ« over the 1 proposed park and examined
the boundaries, and am better satisfied than
ever that th* Council selected the very lands
most suitable for a park. We are to get these
Undi for $1000 per acre, and the Realty Syndi
cate offer to me. as representing the city, to
permit a Joint commute* qt the Board of
Trade and the Merchants' Exchange, or a com
mittee from, the Progress Federation or from
the Council to exam:r.e the contracts and all
â¢vteerees of cost end ascertain what these
lands have cost the syndicate. The eynfiicate
declares that it will bÂ« found that the cost Is
In excess of $1000 per acre. t '
The taafia selected by the Council eeem to
have been formed by nature for our park, .and
I hop* every voter will vtelt the grounds be
fore election. If the voters do there can be
no doubt as to the result.
Now, as to the knocking statements. A
morning paper cays this mornmg that the
Bather tract consists of 600 acres and that the
Realty Syndicate paid $21)0.000 for it. or a
little over $400 per acre, and that the best part
of the tract has been reserved from sale to Uie
Â«lty. â¢ -
Now, here are dtatements of fact that,, if tnje,
, ought to' make us pause. Are^they true? No.
ThÂ« Sather tra.pt consists of 250 acres instead
of 600. and the Realty Syndicate paid therefor
S2R5.000 or a little over $1000 per acr*. The
Hitxrnla Bank had previously loaned $175,000
upon the property. About 120 acres of this
SfeO-acre tract U included in the park Bite and
I ushesltatintrly commend the judgment of the
Council In electing this particular 120 acres
es a -Dortlon of the park site. j -. Â«
' Voters, eo and pee it, and I will guarantee
you will alsojndorse the Council. Tb.e fine
roads constructed tiy'the syndicate will enabl*
yoU'io go over it. Bet test is not alL . I have
an cCer from . the Realty Syndicate to let the
city have the remaining 160 acreÂ« of the tract
at cost. -Th* i>art eÂ«>l<?<HÂ«l ie -the Â«ulyâ part
cf tbe Sather tract that has trees and roade
on it. These roads cost $-0,000, so I am told.
It Is the part, too. that has the fceautiful level
and partly wooded valley. Again, and prob
*bly of rnost lmportanc. It is, the > part where
there is the fine creek of living water now run
ring in this month of September. Where ehaJl
we get water if we do not have a creek?
Th* water is a larpe clement of value.
TnÂ«? talk about rugged steep canyons Is rot.
Go tr.i ft for. yoursÂ»elv*r. *. There is not one
of you -who win say those wooded ' side ; hllls
ehouU not be obtained tor .a. . park. "We don't
Â¦want the land to build c4' though there is
plenty for the purpoew, but we do want
be-autirul eatura.1 recrestiea grounds. Don't
be u&mpeded Against tbe park, but turn out
and vote for that which no modern, up-to
citf city can do without.

sold for 15 cents a cake?
It was made for a hos-

the doctors wanted a soap
that would wash as sharp
as any and do no harm
to the skin. That means
a soap all soap, with no

but soap; there is nothing
mysterious in it. Cost de-
pends on quantity; quan-

In the early '90's the merchants o*
San Francisco, provoked at the exac
tions of the transcontinental railways
in the matter of freight rates, started
out to move goods in their own be
half and in vessels under their own
control. They apked Grace & Co. to
put on a competing line of clipper
ships around Cape Horn. The deal
was made. Three years the Graces,
as agents of the San Francisco mer
chants, kept their competing clipper
ship line going.
Mr. Grace conducted the business of
J. W. Grace & Co. in this city until
1879. Then he founded the house of
Grace Bros. & Co. at Lima, Peru. In
1887 he went'to New York and took a
principal part in the business of the
Graces there. Ten years later he went
to England to live, relinquishing active
management in the Grace houses.
â¢ In 1895 a consolidation of the Grace
Interests took place. The name of W.
R. Grace & Co. was adopted for all. By
this name they are now known. W. R.
Grace, a brother of J. W. Grace, was a
Mayor of New York City. Morgan
Grace of New Zealand was another
brother. Michael Grace is a financier of
prominence In London.
In 1871 Mr. Grace came to San
Francisco. He was a native of Clon
mel. County Kildare, Ireland. Not
bred a business man. he nevertheless
had strong business instincts in com
mon with other members of a gifted
family. In Ireland he was a farmer.
In his next place of residence, San
Francisco, he was he head of a large
commercial house, which ran clipper
ships between New York .and San
Francisco.
John W. Grace, formerly of San
Francisco, the founder of J. W. Grace
& Co., now known as W. R. Grace
& Co., died yesterday at his country
home at Leybourne Grange, Kent,
England. He was a great merchant
who Influenced the commercial life of
two continents. He was a genial gen
tleman, with a reoutation for personal
probity and amiability. A hale lover
of outdoor sports, -he followed the
hounds at fox hunts until a very short
time before his death. When he was
unable to mount a horse and # take
fences and ditches his fondness for
sport still induced him to have a cart,
in which he could .speed after flying
Reynard. His name was known and
his business operations were familiar
to" all the commercial ports on the
west coast of both North America and
South America and to all merchants
from Canada to .-the southernmost ha
ven in South America.

BOSTON, Sept. 19.â Robert Treat
Paine Jr., the famous Democratic lead
er, twice Democratic candidate for Gov
ernor of Massachusetts, has bolted his
party and will vote for Mr. Roosevelt.
Paine was a candidate for Governor in
the silver Bryan days and polled the
largest Democratic vote since Russell.
He is known outside the State and his
declaration will have great influence.
"I am going to vote for Mr. Roose
velt," said Paine. "I am Democratic
enough still to feel that I want the
President of this country to be demo
cratic enough to meet any man whose
character deserves it at any function.
I have myself dined with Booker.Wash
ington, and would consider it a privi
lege again to do so. If elected President
would Mr. Parker bar out Booker
Washington? Would he discriminate
against him because of race or color?
Would he have a jim crow pantry be
hind the house, so Booker Washington
might be shunted off?"
George Fred Williams, the Hearst
leader, says Paine's action will be a
recommendation to him in the future,
inasmuch as the leading factors in
Democratic leadership to-day are the
men who were voting for McKinley in
1696.

y Mrs. Weisslitz, president of the Ger-ffl
man Womans* Club of Buffalo, N. Y., after
doctoring for two years, was finally cured
of her kidney trouble by the use of
Lydia E* Pinkham's Vegetable Compound*
Of all the diseases known rrith which the female organism is aflBicted,
kidney disease is the most fatal. la fact, unless prompt and correct treatment
is applied, the vrearv patient seldom surriTes.
Bcinp fally atraVe of this. Mrs. Pinkham. early in her career, gave .careful
rtudy to tbe subject, and in producing her preat remedy for woman's ills â
Lydia E. PiTikliain*s Vegetable Corupouiid â made sure that it con-
tained the correct combination of herbs which was certsin to control -that
dreaded disease, woman's kidney troubles. The Vegetable Compound acts
in harmony with the laws that povern the entire female system, and while
there are isinv so called remedies for kidney troubles. Lydia E. Pink-
hanTs Vegetable Compound is the only one especially prepared
for wonicu.
Read What Mrs. Weisslitz Says.
"Dear Mrs. PrsKHAii:â For two years my life was simply a bur-
den, I suffered so â¢with female troubles, and pains across my back and
loins. â¢ The doctor told me that I had kidney troubles and prescribed
for me. For three months I took his medicines, but grew steadily
worse. My husband then advised me to try Lydia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Compound, and brought home a bottle. It is the greatest
blessing ever brought to our home. Within three months I was a
changed vomanJ My pain had disappeared, my compjexion became
clear, my eyes bright/and my entire system in good shape." â Mbs. Paula
Weisslitz^ 176 Seneca St., Buffalo, X. Y.
Prwf that Kidney TronWe can be Cored by Lydia E. Pinlham*s Yegetsble CÂ«mpÂ«md.
t Dear Mrs. Pinkhasi:â I feel very thankful to you for the good
your medicine has done me. I had doctored for years and was steadily
growing worse. I had trouble with my kidneys, and two doctors told
me I had Bri^ht's disease : also had falling of the womb, and could not
walk a block at a time. My back and head ached all the time, and I was
go nervous I could not sleep ; had hysteria and fainting spells, was tired
all the time, had such a pain in my left side that I could hardly stand
at times without putting my foot on something. . : i:
? I doctored with several good doctors, but they did not help me any.
I took, in all, twelve bottles of Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound, five boxes of Liver Pills, and used three packages of Sanative
Wash, and feel like a new woman, can eat and sleep well, do all my own
work, and can walk two miles without feeling over tired. The doctors
tell me that my kidneys are all right now. I am so happy to be well,
and I feel that I owe it all to your medicine." â Mks. OrAL Strong,

SHE portrait accompanying this article sent by the London correspond

the favorite melodies of "his unregenerate^days he substituted revivalists'

RECENTLY, with proper ceremony, a memorial was placed in
the fine chapel at Mare Island Navy Yard in honor of the men
who perished on our warships in the hurricane at Apia. It
was a proper and wholesome act, for while honoring the dead it in
cited in the living fidelity to duty by the assurance that sacrifice is
remembered of men. ,
That chapel ought to have placed in it another memorial of his
toric interest, and one that will recognize a class of navy officers
whose duty is so gently and faithfully done that the public make
little note of it or them.
With the" American squadron that raised the flag at Monterey
was a navy chaplain, Rev. Walter Colton. He was a man of execu
tive force and high character. Commodore Stockton appointed him
Provisional. Alcade of Monterey, July 28, 1846, and he was elected
to the same office September 15th following. Royce in his "Califor
nia'' of him ; "On September 4, 1846, he held the first jury
trial in California. He found the people good tempered and studied
them faithfully, applying from the first "a sensible and tolerant" mind
to understanding and helping them in his office of Alcalde, and was
in all respects an example of the more enlightened American influ
ence at its very best, in a time of transition. The people of Monte
rey liked him and felt generally contented with the new rule as rep
resented by him.*'
Rev. Dr. Willey, in his "Transition Period of California,^ says:
"Colton with Semple, finding some old type at Monterey, printed
the first newspaper in California on August 15, 1846, entitled The
Californian. Colton made the first announcement of the discovery
of gold to the Journal of Commerce in New York, in a letter to
that paper."
The newspaper started by Colton and Semple became the Alta
California, the first and oldest newspaper on the coast.
Chaplain Colton began the planting of American institutions
here fifty-eight years ago. He was the pioneer of two great insti
tutions, the judicial and the journalistic. His influence as a founder
was useful and wise. He remained here until after the gold discov
ery, and his whole history and career may be traced. A memorial
window to hirn in the navy yard chapel will be a proper ascription
to an American_who did his duty wisely and cleanly. The Call in
vites expressions concerning him from the surviving pioneers,
among whom may be many who knew him and his work. The pro
fessions of law and journalism may well join those in the ministry in
promoting this memorial.

Women and children have a great

You will see Miss Bright Mind bub
bling over with vivacity. She will
eay all sorts of clever things, and her
vivacity is becoming. She is little and
slender perhaps and a bit of kiiten
isheas now and then rather suits her
style. Some fine day Miss* Dull-
Headed will run across Miss Bright
Mind and the D. H. will think to her
self: "Dear me, how attractive she
makes h\erself. Why can't I do that?"
So Miss D. H. starts in to be vivacious,
too, and the result is she makes a
lovely monkey of herself, and instead
of gathering huzzahs of adnrriration
from the multitudes at large she
gathers in a whole lot of deep pity.
The hat that may look fine on your
neighbor may look dreadful on you.
And manners must be as becoming
as hats. What is food for one stom
ach is poison for another, and the
gayety that may be charming in one
woman appears absurd in her neigh
bor.
Very often you will find a thin,
slenderly woman, who tattles eternally
about wanting to be fat. She absorbs
cod liver oil and worries the family
into taking residence at Chestnut Hill
because she would like to gain ten
pounds or a little more. After a time
she manages to plumpen up a littleâ
and looks a sight.
Again we have the deluded young
woman who doesn't- like the color of
her hair. Miss Brown, across the way,
has lovely red hair and Miss Black
thinks she will have an order of it
herself. When the red hair^is finally
acquired Miss Black cannot be recog
nized hy her own mother, and instead
of looking like a masterpiece â as does
Miss Brown â she resembles a carica
ture.
The best way is to be your own self,
to be your individual self. You have
the framework for a type of your own.
Take your individuality as you find it,
touching up the best points and em
bellishing them, and hiding as best
you can the little failings and foibles
and foolishnesses that are sure to be
lurking around somewhere. Since you
have a type of your own, do not go
out and find a type that can't possibly
fit you and then try to palm that off
as your own, for the deception will be
quite plain.
Let out your best thoughts. Learn
to speak softly, to' move gracefully, to

ORATORY THAT WON*.
Congressman William H. Jackson of
Maryland was engrossed in discussing
with a number of colleagues the de
cadence of oratory. "Sane people are
not emotional," declared the Congress
man, "and the conversational delivery
of a speech carries as much weight
with an intelligent audience as does the
effort of a declaimer who indulges in
brilliant periods with an arm-swinging
accompaniment."
"You are right," said a listener, "and
your statement reminds me of a young
lady who had. two suitors. Both men
had about the same advantages and
prospects, but gossip declared that the
girl would decide in favor of the man
who was a lawyer, for he knew better
how to present and win his case. Gos
sip erred; the lawyer was rejected.
Later it was learned from a friend in
whom the betrothed had confided -the
reasons for her choice.

PARKER ON PERSONALITIES.
THE Democratic campaign for the last year and now is personal
and directed against President Roosevelt. The only speeches
of importance so far made were by Senator Bailey, D. B. Hill
snd Bourke Cockran. They were all intense and fervid against the
personality of the President. He was. accused of violating the con
stitution, and upon that major charge was strung every minor ac
cusation that can go to his character as a man.
The most serious crime against the republic and its citizens is
the violation of a President's oath for the purpose of subverting the
constitution. It is perjury to effect treason. It is a crime inconsist
ent with good personal character. To charge it against a President
is to charge him with being a character wholly bad, unworthy to sit
among the sons of liberty, a bad man, capable of crimes the highest
and the lowest. That is the chosen attitude of the opposition to
President Roosevelt. It is an attack not limited to his official char
acter. It goes straight to his personal character. If it be true and
can be proved, he is the un worthiest of the unworthy, an enemy of
his country and his countrymen.
If a President violate and destroy the constitution he has com-
mitted a crime against the human race that outlaws him throughout
the world. Time and again the Democratic leaders have declared
that President Roosevelt is the sole issue. The charges made against
the President are of such a nature that they are also charges against
the man and citizen. >
This being the situation now. while the campaign is yet young,
it is apparent that the people do not believe the charges against the
President. The campaign against him is a failure. It has been
pushed tentatively by the Democratic speakers, and is found to
strengthen the President and weaken Judge Parker. Therefore, it
becomes necessary to do something. The plan of campaign has to
be changed. The fixed ammunition so laboriously acquired cannot
be used. Something else must be tried, and the change must be
made to seem a virtue and not a necessity. In this emergency Judge
Parker makes an appearance. In a public letter, addressed to the
compiler of the Democratic campaign textbook, he begs of that
functionary that personal attacks upon the President be omitted
from that publication.
If there were need for the letter it must exist in the need of ex
purgation of the matter already prepared for the textbook. When
the volume is issued we Â»vill see whether it contains the charge that
the President ha^ violated the constitution. If it do, the ingenuity
of Judge Parker cannot make it appear as anything less than a
charge that the President is a perjurer. The country will not be
biinded by a spectacular play of good manners. Either the President
is obedient to the constitution and mindful of his oath or he is not.
There is no haif way point in the situation. If he is not, he should
be defeated. If he is, he should be elected, not merely to vindicate
him personally, but to safeguard the constitution itself. ,
Judge Parker is in the same attitude as Mr. Caminetti. He
avails himself of the indecent attitude of his party to put himself
in contrast with it, and appear as the personal champion of public
decency in a campaign. Neither in the Republican campaign text
book, nor out of it. has any such charge been made against Judge
Parker. His personal character is accepted for what it is, upright
and clean. Only such public reputation as he has acquired since he
became a candidate for nomination has been under examination and
been made the subject of criticism that has not been originated by
the Repi-.blican party. It was made public for months before his
nomination by members of his own party. Two of the most influen
tial of these, Mr. Hearst and Colonel Bryan, furnished the country
with all that need be said about Judge Parker.
As Mr. Hearst was the second choice of the convention for the
Presidency, and Mr. Bryan was easily the leadyig spirit in the con
vention and is called by the National Committee to take the stump
for the party, these criticisms had high party indorsement. Their use
and their extension by the Republican committee is perfectly legiti
mate. It cannot denv them. They must be recalled by the men who
made them and by the party which so pointedly indorsed them.
Judge Parker need not hope to put himself in the attitude of a per
sonally abused man, because the opposition uses against him what
H'as said of him by the most conspicuous men in his own party.
No Republican desires a personal campaign. None will dodge
it if forced by the attacks on President Roosevelt. The keynote of
the Republican campaign is the speech made by Mr. Root to the
Chicago convention, which was entirely free of partisan attacks upon
the opposition, or upon the personality of any opposition leader. Xo
President since Lincoln has been made the victim of as much en
venomed personal abuse as President Roosevelt. If the opposition
desire to repent, recant and mend its manners in that respect it can
Â«lo so, though it will have no issue left. Â¦* % ,
The Way Bryan Will Appear When Hill and Belmont Send for Him.
Editor The Callâ Considering: the In
terest awakened by the reports of thÂ«
â¢great battle3 and the great losses In
'the late engagements in Manchuria. It
| may be well to think a HttJ" about th*Â»
greatest losses In any one day's fight
ing In the Civil War at th* battle of
Antietam, September 17, 1862, forty
two years ago to-day.
We hear a great deal about the In
tense patriotism of the Japanese and
j their willingness to die for their Em
' peror. meaning perhaps their country.
I and of the extraordinary bravery of the
' Russians, fortified by their faith Ir
their "Ikons"; of the great improve
ment in artillery, such destructive pÂ«r.v
der and the long range riRes of the in
fantry.
According to the Russian report the
losses in ten days' fighting were 4000
killed and 12.000 wounded, a total of
16,000. The Japanese report a total of
17,533 killed and wounded. The reports
are not explicit enough to enable us
to make fair comparisons as to per
centages of losses, as the number en
gaged is unki.own, but we may reason
ably estimate that there were approxi
mately 200,000 on each side.
At the battle of Antietam probably
every man on the Confederate side was
In action. Estir ~tes vary and there
is no way of arriving at the facts, but
there is no doubt that there* were ap
proximately 50,000 men. On the Union
side there was about the same number,
certainly not more were engaged- . .-Â».."
The reports of losses as to the Union
army are very nearly accurate, white
in the Confederate army the reports
are not to be depended upon. If Gen
eral McClellan's report .Is to be relied
upon when he says: * About 2700 of the
enemy's dead were counted and burled
upon the battlefield of Antietam. â¢ â¢ A
portion f their dead had previously
been burled by the enemy."

The Supreme Court has decided that
the coyote scalp claims must be paid.
Those 1 who have' secured court judg
ments are at liberty to take their
money at once. The aggregate amount
of" the claims is nearly $250,000. The
decision was rendered in an action
begun by Charles Blckerdike on as
signed claims amounting to $72,330 un
der an authorizing suit for the re
covery of coyote bounties. The plain
tiff got judgment for J59.6S0 and the
Attorney General appealed. The Su
preme Court holds that the act was
valid and that the State cannot repu
diate its contract.
In 1891 the Legislature passed a law
giving 55 for each coyote scalp. Farm
ers stopped tilling the soil and took to
hunting coyotes. In some sections of
the State scalps were worn thin
through having been presented go
many times. Enterprising speculators
bought coyote scalps in Nevada, Ari
zona and New Mexico at $1 and sold
them several times f6r $5 apiece in
California. It. was too i good a thing
to last and the act was repealed when
the State owed half a million dollars.
Bickerdlke appealed from an order
reducing some of his claims and he is
sustained by the Supreme .Court, so
that he may recover the entire amount
f 01 which he sued. *
The court- also.decided. yesterday that
Daniel McCarthy must oegin another
euit if he hopes to get possession of the
levee at Sacramento and "oust the
Southern Pacific ' Company from its al
leged Tight of way.' McCarthy peti
tioned to have his* title to the Norris
town tract cuieted. Tne levee ' runs
through the property and the. railroad
has its tracks on . top . of . the dyke. The
lower court gave judgment for McCar
thy and then granted a motion. for a
new. trial. McCarthy appealed, but the
Supreme Court thinks another hear
ing of the case advisable. ,
At about 10 o'clock last Sunday night
Dillon' saw two men walking down Val
lejo street wharf, one of whom had a
basalt paving block tied to his waist.
They sat down upon some piling near
the edge of the wharf and engaged in
conversation in the German language.
The man with the stone was threaten
ing to jump overboard and his friend
was detaining him. Dillon started
toward them, when the man carrying
the stone ran toward the edge of the
wharf. Dillon caught him by the arm,
but the man ; broke loose from him
and jumped overboard. Dillon and the
suicide's companion got a boat hook
and grappled for the body. . â¢ â¢
When they had drawn it to the wharf
Dillon notified the Coroner's office and
Deputy Coroner Meehan came for the
body. He cut / the stone block away
from the dead man and let it lie on
the wharf, where it was found by
Police Patroiman F. T. Becker of the
Harbor Hospital, who conveyed it and
a bottle one third full of claret to the
police station and later to the Coron
er's office. * â¢ â¢ ~ . . :'
The suicide's companion disappeared
after he and Dillon rescued the body.
On : the person of the suicide was a
card of the Building Trades Council,
bearing the name . "F. Leuthold." Up
to a late hour yesterday no one had
applied for the body or identified it.
The paving' block . wei ghed' about twen
ty pounds.' T - -"? Â¦t--''
According to the report of the police
detectives regarding the man supposed
to be F. Leuthold, whose body was re
covered from the bay yesterday morn
ing, the case was not one of murder
as stated on the . Coroner's record, but
one of undoubted suicide. Detectives
Bailey and Whittaker reported to Cap
tain Martin, Chief of Detectives, yes
terday the 1 following statement made
to them by .W. S. Dillon, night watch
man for Crowley's boathouse:
The case was originally set for trial
yesterday, but it was by agreement to
go over until September 28. Meantime
the detective force will try to learn
whether the rumor of death is true.
When the calendar was called yester
day Attorney Frank J. Murphy,' who
represents Kratz, handed the, Judge a
letter which Mrs. R. M. White, a Bister
of Kratz, bad received from her father
in Los Angeles, dated September 16.
It said tbat A. A. Kratz had the pre
vious day hired a bathing machine at
Long Beach. He' had not been seen
Etabe and his clothes were found in the
machine. It was supposed he had been
carried out to sea. Murphy also sub
mitted a letter from A. A. Kratz, dated
September 11, in which he expressed
bis anxiety for a speedy trial. Murphy
asked that the case be dismissed.
The Judge said he would like some
thing definite as to the death of the de
fendant. He suggested that Assistant
District Attorney Whiting make, in
quiries. The case was continued till
this morning, and Whiting placed the
matter in the hands of Captain Martin.
Kratz was out on bonds.
Kratz's brother William is serving a
term of five years in San Quentin on
the same charge. William was a mem
ber of the firm of the Donandt-Kratz
Company, commission merchants, and
fled with over 116,000 of the firm's
money. A. A. Kratz was with him at
the time he left the ofHce with the
money and was arrested the following
day. William was arrested in Kansas
City, where he was living under an as
sumed name, and brought back to t he
city by Detective T. B. Gibson;
When the case of the people against
A. A. Kratz, charged with felony em
bezzlement, was called in Judge
Durfbe's court yesterday the defend
ant's attorney suggested that his client
was dead. 1

PACIFIC GROVE, Sept. 19. â The
steamship Northland, Captain Samuel
Bonifield. bound from Portland to
San Pedro, via San Francisco, ran on
the rocks about a mile south of Point
Pinos Lighthouse and about two miles
from Pacific Grove at 2 o'clock this
morning.
The Northland left San Francisco at
3 o'clock yesterday afternoon and was
to have put into Monterey with 800,000
feet of lumber, consigned to Healy,
Tibbetts & Co. Peter Hedoal, the first
mate, was in command when the ves
sel struck the rocks. Captain Boni
field explains the mishap by saying
that the mate mistook the Point Pinos
light for that at Santa Cruz and went
to the wrong side of it. The night was
clear and the mobn was shining
brightly when the accident occurred.
The Northland was going at full
speed when she struck and a great
hole was torn in her starboard bow.
Perfect order prevailed among: the
passengers and crew and after jetti
soning a part of the deckload Captain
Bonlfleld succeeded in getting his
vessel into deep water.

The defendant personally then filed
a i>lea of once in jeopardy, and the
Judge said if he insisted upon forcing
the rlea and consented to the discharge
of the jury he could not plead once in
Jeopardy. Th'.s seemed to surprise the
defendant's attorney, and the Judge
told him he could consider the best
course to pursue between now and the
date set for the trial.
The Judge overruled the objection
and said the Supreme Court had held
that all of the proceedings at the
former trial subsequent to the opening
statement by the District Attorney
were void. The case would have to be
retried by the same jury. If the jury
was discharged without the defendant's
consent then he could plead once in
jeopardy. The only way was to call the
Jury back, as it had never been legally
discharged.
Attorney Barber thought It would be
unfair to both sides to try the case by
the same Jury. The Jurors' minds were
possibly not in a proper condition to
weigh the evidence fairly after the
Judge's Instructions to acquit. The
Judge said:
I will acaln advire the jury to acquit tf
there :Â« no furcier evidenc* to offer and will
rtve my reaeo&a. Of course the Jury need
net fcÂ« rulded by aiy aflvic*. but if a verdict
wi rendered cenvictlTig: the defendant 1 would

a* to smitur the case for trial and will give
the defendant twenty days after the order is
tt.ade to prt-sent a bill of exc*ptJsiss. The
Jurc-re can be here on October 31. then if an
order U made to discharge them it can be
cor.Fi5ered at that time.

erred in instructing the jury to acquit.
Yesterday when the case was called
to be set again for trial Attorney Hos

ground that the defendant was acquit
ted by a jury, that the verdict had
never been reversed, that the defendant
was ordered discharged from custody
and the jury discharged and that neith

the attempt to retry the case was un

of the organization which he repre
sents. 9
Emery gave the history of the
trade* union, tracing it back to the
period when he admitted it waa neces
t-..ry to gain concessions for the work
iijrmaji. When the unions asked for
better hours and higher wages, he
said, they had the sympathy of the
â¢uhlic. but he asserted that the labor
organization went further and by
m^r.* of coercion, threat* and intimi
dntion they ultimately gained an un
<â¢<rstitmion.il and unlawful power.and
<:â¢::>â¢ to men not affiliated with them
the r:ght to enjoy the liberty guar
anteed by the constitution of the
I'nited States.
Emery declared the boycott not only
â¢-â¢â¢.'awful, but ?cainst the principles
of American Â« :tiz*Â»nÂ«=hip. The people
<u Mn Franrisco had daily object lep
Â¦ona of the boycott in the brutal a?
srultjt upon men. who, because not af
ilfated with labor unions, had been
-urjected to murderous attack. HÂ«Â»
h-.rped the unions "with beir.g a parry
to the assaults since they fail to ex
5 â¢â¢: iho*Â»* members who are guilty of
the sstauits. In substantiation of his

Healdsburg growers, who are In a vicinity

tance of sixteen miles.
SANTA ROSA. ScDt. 19. â Dissatisfaction Is
stirring the wine grape growers of the northern
part of Sonoma County. They are up against
the California Wine Association, which Is only
offering them $13 for their crop, and compell
ing them to accept their money In three install,
ments. Two of these become payable in three
and six months after the delivery of the crop.
Last season the growers ; of that vicinity
talked of forming a co-operative company and
erecting, a winery of their own, but they did
not act quickly enough, and then it was real
ized that the winery could not be got ready
for the crop of that year. At the present time
it Is probable that they will take active
measures to establish a winery of their Ipwn
for next season's vintage.

Judge P. J. Reilly's official scores:
Pofala ran a remarkable course when
the defeated Wild Norah in the final of
the special stake at Union Coursing
Park yesterday. The fast daughter of
Moondyne II ran up a total of twenty
Â¦ix points without allowing her oppo
nent to score. Try as she would. Wild
Norah could not get possession of the
The talent was given a hard Jolt In
the second round when Flaunt beat
Gcldtn Fortune at long odds. Again in
the third round they freely laid 3 to 1
against Wild Xorah in her course with
Mellenwood. The wise players were
strictly out of line on this race, as Wild
Xorah led her opponent to the hare,
Â¦cored the first turn and won decisive
ly. Numerous other short ends at small
odfls landed for the pikers. Mi Amlgo,
Â¦which was runping in excellent form,
was withdrawn in the fourth round on
account of having a severe trial in the
previous round with Ready Address.
They ran for over two minutes, and
when the carne v.as killed both dogs
were exhausted.
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 1.â St. Louis golf
ers to-day captured eleven places In the
36-hole qualifying round of the Olym
pian' golf championship, two former
world's fair city golfers, Ralph McKit
trlck and Stuart Stickney of the Coun
try Club, tying at 163 for the gold
medal honors. Chicago players, headed
by former "Western Champion Walter
B. Egan of Exmoor, finished ten strong
in the. circle of thirty-two eligible for
match play In the first round to-mor
row.
F. C. Newton of Seattle, the Pacific
Coast star, who recently gained a place
in the national tournament as far as
the, second round, totaled 164 for his
day's task of thirty-six holes, meeting
with Just enough hard luck in the aft
ernoon round of eighty-four to deprive
him of the elaborate trophy offered by
the Olympian committee for the best
qualifying score. A. C. Mclntosh of
Pueblo, Colo., failed to qualify, his
score being 207.
As arranged now the backs are: Sper
ry. full: Snedigar, right half; Kern, left
half; Klttrelle, quarter. Snedigar was
substitute right half on last year's var
sity. Kern was right half of his fresh
man team and Kittrelle right half on
the second eleven. As the season ad
vances these men are likely to be
changed, but it seems now that Coach
Hopper is pretty well satisfied with the
make-up.
Sperry, the youth who has been such
a surprise on the gridiron, is a positive
find for the varsity. Hi3 showing makes
It easy now to fill a breach that was a
puzzler for the coaches. Sperry is big
enough for the position and has all the
weight and spirit and dash that go to
make a good player. His style is a good
deal like that of Weller, whose work
for Stanford last year was so telling.
The most significant move of the
football year at the University of Cali
fornia was taken to-day, when Coach
James Hopper changed to fullback on
the varsity eleven Sperry. the big
freshman" lad from Modesto, who fig
ured so prominently aa a back In the
late Freshman-Oakland game. The
move la significant not only because It
brings to the front a very promising
player, but also brings about some
changes in the line that were not
looked for.
Putting Sperry at fullback mean*
that Force- and Stern were candl-,
dates ,for that position, having filled it
last year, will remain on the line, prob
ably as right tackle and right guard,
respectively, where they have been prac
ticing all along this season. This then
will force out of the varsity or into an
other place either Howard, last year's
left tackle, or Gray, right guard on last
year's second eleven. It is possible that
one of these men will be placed at left
end, as the eleven is weak in the ma
terial that has been tried out for that
place sv< far.
Taking into consideration these
changes, the line-up of the team ought
to be as follows: Stroud, center; Stern,
right guard; Heitmuller, left guard;
Force, right tackle; Howard or Gray,Â«
left tackle: Oliver, right end; Howard.
Gray or Henry, left end. Heitmuller has
not got into the game yet and Gray is
playing in his place, but as soon as
"Heine" arrives there will- be a changs
in the line, as indicated.

GRAVESEND, N. Y n Sept. 19. â
Twenty thosuand persons saw 'the
grand race mare Beldame win the
first special to-day. It was "her thir
teenth start and eleventh victory this
year, her only two defeats being when
she ran third in the Metropolitan
handicap at one mile, won by Irish
Lad, and second to Hermis in the Test
handicap at one mile 'at .Brighton. In
both these races Beldame was ad
judged by all observers to have had
hard luck. In the Metropolitan she
was ridden by an apprentice, A. Bre'n
nan, and was much" knocked about.
In the Test handicap she was in the
pocket for more than half a mile.
Her conqueror, Hermis, has not run
since that race and has been retired
for the year. Irish Lad, too, is in re
tirement.
More than $50,000 has been won by
Beldame this year. As she has landed
at all distances and on both dry and
muddy tracks and against the best
horses whose owners would run
against her, it cannot be denied that
she is fairly entitled to being called
"Queen of the Turf." <

Altoona, Pa., June 20, 1903.
I was afflicted with Tetter in bad shape.
It would appear in blotches as large as my
hand, a yellowish color, and scale oft.
You can imagine how offensive it was.
For twelve years I was afflicted with this
trouble. At night it was a case of scratch
and many times no rest at all. Seeing the
good the medicine was doing a friend
who was Uking it for Eczema, I com*
menced it, and as a result the eruption be-
gan to dry up and disappear, and to-day!
I am practically a well man. Only two
tiny spots are left on the elbow and shin,
where once the whole body was affected.
I have every confidence in the medicine,
and feel sure that in a short time these
two remaining spots will disappear.'
S. S. S. is certainly a great blood puri-
fier, and has done me a world of good.'
I am grateful for what it has accom-
plished; and trust that what I have said
will lead others who are similarly afflict*
ed to take the remedy and obtain tbÂ»
same good results that I have.

Affidavit Filed. .
The prospective disbarment proceedings
against Attorney Frank Schilling, based trpen
an affidavit of Dina Smith, whom he repre-
Etrnted in two unsuccessful suits for divorce,
brought forth an answer from him yesterday
and an affidavit in which he reflect* upon
Judgr Hunt. It was charged that Schilltag
had received frcm Andrew Smith. Dina's has
band, the sum of $30. which he failed to tarn
cvÂ«r to the wife. Schilling declare* ba re
ceived the money, but that Mrs. Smith agreed
that it ohouid be applied on account of his
f?e of $75 awarded by tije court.
Schilling charges that Judge Hunt instructed
his d*rk to preoaxe tbe affidavit purporting
to have besn made by Mrs. Smith, and that
th!s was rurocsely drawn defectively In order
that the attorney's reputation might saSer
during the delay in reconstructing tha affi
davit. Schilling avers that Judge Hunt made
no effort to get at th# facts in the case,
and he declares that the Judga feels aggrieved
because Schilling Ignored an Invitation to con
tribute to a memorial of the late Ward Mc-
Allister. The lawyer aays that Jadga Hunt
wants to act as accuser and jndgs in the dis

The Board of Education also sub
mitted the resolution it passed a few
weeks ago, asking the Supervisors to
appropriate funds for a separate
school for the Japanese children. The
School Directors set forth that the
accommodations in the public schools
were already overtaxed and that the
Japanese often compelled the exclu
sion of white children.
In their communication to the Su
pervisors the Japanese point out that
the number of their children attend
ing school is small, but scattered all
over the city. To confine tkem to one
school would require some of the
children to travel the entire length of
the city to attend it- The matter was
referred to a committee.
The board passed to print the resolu
tion formally fixing the State tax rate
at 53.5 cents, segregated as follows:
General fund, 31.2 cents; school fund,
17.8 cents; interest and sinking fund, 1
cent; support of University of Cali
fornia, 2 cents; support of high schools,
1.5 cents. Added to the city's tax, "the
total rate for San Francisco is $1,655.
A resolution was passed ordering that
the dome of the City Hall be lighted
September 19. 20. 22 and 23 in honor of
the visiting Odd Fellows.
James Hagan & Co. sent a communi
cation to the boerd offering. to sell their
cemetery in San Mateo County for bur
ial of the indigent dead. The offer was
made as the result of reports that the
board contemplated taking the inter
ment of lndigents out of the hands of
the firm. . ,
The Santa Fe Railroad Company was
granted permission to lay and main
tain a spur track connecting its yard
in China Basin with the tracks of the
United Railroads at the intersection of
Fourth and Kentucky streets.
The Supervisors' Fire and Judiciary
Committee yesterday recommended a
change in the ordinance concerning the
height of buildings, Increasing the |
limit from 201 feet to 220 feet. The
recommendation was made at the in
stigation of M. H. de Young, who de- j
sires to add two stories to his building
&t Kearny and Market streets and to
erect an addition of equal height on the
Kearny street side. * i
-Japanese parents warmly resent the
aspersion which they think 'has been
cast on their children by the Board of
Education in the declaration that "it
is extremely deplorable white chil
dren and Mongolians must be edu
cated side by side in the same rooms
of the schools of this city."
The pride of the little brown peo
ple has been touched. They plead for
a test of comparison of their little
hopefuls with those of white color.
They assert that in point of scholar
ship, cleanliness of person and polite
ness of deportment they are the
equals of the Caucasian race and that
contact with them can have no effect
that is disadvantageous.
The argument is made that most of
the Japanese children are native born
and should not be denied the training
to fit them for American citizenship,
to which they will be entitled. And
then comes adroitly a rebuke to a
Christianity that draws the line of
racial distinction.
The Japanese presented their views
to the Board of Supervisors yesterday
in a petition signed by many heads of
families protesting asainst the estab
lishment of separate schools for their
children, which City and County At
torney Long has advised must follow
the exclusion of the Japanese from
the existing schools.

Cockswain Boljes and two other men
Â¦who were on board the launch at the
time were uninjured. It is remarkable
that greater damage was not done, as
rJl five men were sitting close around
the bciler. As It was, quoting from the
unofficial rerort of the Marblehead's
crew. ?two men were badly hurt and
tfarÂ«*e men badly scared."
The boat, which was filling, was hur
riedly hoisted on her davits and swung
inboard. The launch and boiler are old
and the accident is probably due to the
worn condition of the fastenings of the
manhole plate. The wreck will be sent
to Mare Island navy yard and the Mar
blehead Â¦will g-et a new launch.
The cruiser Marblebead, the lone war
thip cf the bay, came near making
some history of her own yeeterday fore
noon &e Ehe Lay at anchor off Pacific
f treet wharf. The steam launch of the
cruiser, moored to the swinging boom
alongside, suddenly blew np, sending a
cclusa cf smoke and steam, the boat's
smokestack and bits cf boiler as high
as the Ehip's masihead. The explosion
made a tremendous roar, and the men
aboard the cru.&er at first thought the
main battery had been fired at some
imaginary intruder.
After the air had cleared it was found
that the manhole plate of the launch's
bcller had blown off, badly damaging
the machinery and opening the seams
cf the boat so as to let the water
rcur in.
T. J. Green, first-class fireman, and
A. C. Cclernan. coal passer, were badly
injured by being scalded with hot
â¢water and struck by flying pieces cf
Iron. They were removed unconscious
to the hospital cf the ship and their in
juries attended to by Surgeon BelL It
found that the men were not fatal
ly hurt.
Boat is Badly Wrecked
and Two of the Men
Are Disabled.

I CHICAGO, SÂ«pt. 19.â In spite of a number
! of bear* influences a -flrm feeling prevailed
in the \vheat market at the opening, the De
j ceniber option being up /a shade to %c at
< $1 (Wi to.*l 09%Â«l <i>%. May was up %0
iAc to Kttttc at $1 11% to $1 lisj. The ,
â¢initial .firmness was due mainly to a good de
j mand from traders who had sold short the
pearly part of last .week. 'There waÂ« also fair
j buying by commission bouses on reports of
unfavorable weather., in the Canadian North
west.-' The first of the news at hand, how
ever, was" largely in favor of j the J bear ele
ment. Cables were lower. World's shipments
were much heavier than for the correspond
ing day last week or a year ago.
Â¦Â¦ Receipts ' in the Northwest continued to
show a marked Increase and this fact-, fur
nished the principal motive for the heavy
I selling that developed. Liberal sales -of long
j wheat started prices on the down grade and
i the expectation of stop loss orders accelerated
the decline. On the break December sold oft
to $1 0S% and May to $1 10%. Toward the
middle of the session the market again became
strong, cold, wet weather In Manitoba bring
ing out -a good demand from some of the big
! commission houses. On the rally December
ladvancad to $1 IOVj and May. to $1 12Â»i@l 12%.
I Renewed profit taking, however, resulted in
i another reaction. A fair Increase in the
visible supply and larger primary receipts
, at points elsewhere than the Northwest had a
; weakening effect. Â¦ â¢ â¢
I With extreme weakness manifested at Minne
â¢ apolis the market here became 'decidedly
] .heavy. December selling off to $1 07%, clos
ing at $1 07TÂ»@l OS. a net decline of â¢ l%c.
May sold to $1 09% and closed at $1 09%@
110, a loss of l}Â»c. â¢ A ......
A sharp bulge in corn prices occurred as
a result of a report of a Minneapolis crop ex
â¢ pert claiming the total yield would fall short
! of the Government estimate by 300,000.000
i bushels, the smallest harvested in seven years.
The market became decidedly weak late in
the session, the- close being at 49Â« 8 @49?4c for
December,.* loss of Mfffcc.
Steadily Increasing supplies were a depress
! lug Influence in the oat market. December
.closed 34c lower at 32Hc
I . The fact that hog receipts have not Increased
to any great extent since the settlement of the
| etrilce at the slock . yards, caused strengthon
i ing of the provisions market. At the close

Chicago was very irregular, rising from
$1 09% to $1 10%. falling back to $1 01% and
closing at * 1 08. The wires of E. F. Hutton
6 Co. said:
"It .was an active market. .It showed con
siderable strength early, but on the large
primary receipts and poor cash markets it
turned weak. .The closing was .heavy. The
operative conditions are wholly domestic. The
movement in the Northwest promises to te
free and is still free in the Southwest mar
kets. Demand Is dependent on' millers, ard
the relative flour and wheat prices are not
wholly satisfactory. It will continue to be a
scalping market 1 and there i* enough bullish
sentiment to bring about rallies from sharp
breaks. It will take a pretty good milling de
mand, with the free movement- to bring about
a sustained advance."
In this market tra4e was quiet, owing large
ly to the Jewish holiday, and futures de
clined 2c on the morning session. The cash
grain was firm and unchanged.

OATS â Receipts were large amounting to

Â«onditlon for sellers, with rather more- steadi
ness reported in Black.
CORNâ rThe local situation Is unchanged.
The Chicago wires of E. F. Hutton & Co.
said of that market: "The event or the day
was Jones' estimate of 1.900,000,000 bushels
for the crop. This brought about an improve
ment of a cent. The trade, however was not
.disposed to accept this estimate and the mar
ket turned weak and more than lost the ad
vance. Cash prices were steady. The weather
In the corn belt is fairly favorable, but lower
temperatures are predicted In the Northwest.
There were a good many favorable reports
from private sources and the prevailing senti
ment is bearish."

The suit for divorce filed by Theo

was dismissed yesterday. A motion to
dismiss the suit of Mary Elliott against
John Elliott was filed by the attorney
for the plaintiff.
Suits for divorce were filed yester
day by Karl Hedberg against Char

cruelty; Johannah Gorman against
Thomas F. Gorman, cruelty; Ramona

against Ellen Mitchell, desertion; , C.
I* Robledo against J. M. Robledo,
neglect; by Maud Till against Arthur
Till for $30 monthly for maintenance
without divorce, alleging that he de
serted her September 16.
Then the complaint proceeds with
th<* recital of his misdeeds. Water
man was English bred and nagged his
wife for being an American and
therefore "ill bred." She says that he
spat upon her clothes and face; as
saulted her with his fists, cane and
other articles; threw her down and
Jammed her against the walls. He
would, she says, smash the dishes and
overturn cooking utensils, spilling the
hot contents over her. He was ad
dicted to drinking, gambling and play
ing the races and "in a lordly and
reckless way" wasted a fortune re
coived by will from relatives in Eng
land. He would spitefuly throw small
change at her while throwing away
hundreds at night.
Judge Hebbard granted a divorce to
Maud Ramsey from Frank T. Ram

Josephine Ellen Waterman, in *a suit
for divorce begun yesterday against
Frederick James Waterman, charges
desertion, neglect and cruelty as
grounds for the legal termination of
sixteen years of unhappy married life.
If any forms of husbandly mistreat
ment are missing from the complaint
it is because Waterman's invention
failed or his wife's memory is at fault.
They were married at Vancouver,
Wash., in 1SS8, and from that time,
the plaintiff says, his misconduct was
"too outrageous to admit of publica
tion, but some idea may be gathered
among the less violent of his language
and acts."

WIFE'S STORY
IS EXCITING
The romantic drama, "Monbars,"
attracted a large and enthusiastic au
dience to the Alcazar last night. It
scored a pronounced success. White
Whittlesey in the title role was ad
mirable and effective. At the close of
the fourth act he was called at least
a dozen times before the curtain. Miss
Eug-enie Thais Lawton as Diane
shared honors with the star and gave a
charming, characterization of the mis
judged and loyal young wife. Miss
Juliet Crosby was convincing as Mad
ame Mouton and the other characters
were well sustained by. Harry S. Hil
liard, George Osbourne, Luke Conness,
Miss Marie Howe and the rest of the
cast.
Alcazar.
Maddened with rage after a night
of quarreling, Michael McCarthy shot
and probably fatally Injured his wife,
Octavia, In a room at 1424 Market
street shortly after 11 o'clock yester
day morning. The wife lies hovering
between life and death. at the Emer
gency Hospital, while the brute who
shot her is held at the City Prison
awaiting the result of her injuries.
Jealousy, which the woman's rela
tives claim was unfounded and which
the husband says was justifiable, is
given as the motive for the crime. â¢
A little less than a year ago Mich
ael McCarthy and Octavia Leathe, a
handsome young woman about 20
years of age, were married. Violent
quarrels were frequent. Miss Oveta
Leathe, sister of the wounded woman,
says that a few days ago McCarthy
choked his wife "until her eyes
popped out of her head." Yesterday
morning in the presence of Miss
Leathe McCarthy pulled a revolver
and shot his wife. The bullet entered
her left side between the seventh and
eighth ribs and ranged upward, lodg
ing under the right shoulder blade.
The Indications are that the bullet
pierced both lungs.
To Assistant District Attorney Fer
rari the woman made the following
ante-mortem 'statement:
Mr name is Octavia McCarthy. I lire at 1424
Market street. I have no occupation. I ftrmly
belleve that I am now about to die. My hus
band shot me this mornlnp. He shot me once.
He did It for jealousy. The shooting: took
place at 1424 Market street. My sister was
present at the time. Just before the
shooting my husband eaid he was coin? to
Bhoot me and my sister told him not to do It.
He waited until my back was turned and he
shot me. OCTAVIA MCCARTHY.

An overwhelming desire to taste
chop suey and noodle soup brought J.
O. Raimey and John Crippenback be
fore Judgre Conlan. Against them ap
peared Fat Lung and his seventeen
cousins, who conduct the Oriental
hashhouse where the epicureans dined.
"Two men come my Iestlant," said
Fat Lung. "They say, 'John, you got
tem chop suey?' I say allight. Bime
bye eat 'em up, I say 10 cents apiece.
They say no gottem. Wha* for?

Nothing but a thin layer of glass
separated Steve from liis beloved. Cu
pid, who has the ha-ha on locksmiths,
is also the open shop kid as far as
the Glaziers' Union is concerned.
"From the desert I come to thee,"
Â¦warbled the impetuous lover and
plunged headlong through the glass.
The police found him kneeling at the
feet of the circus, poster. Judge
Conlan told him to pay for the win
dow and to become a woman hater.
As Steve, filled with ardor and the
ardent vino, g-azed at the paper
charmer a miraole occurred. The
poster girl winked one eye and smiled
tenderly upon him. Like Galatea, she
had come to life.
With one coquettish red paint limb
tucked gracefully behind her left ear
the paper lady smiled at Steve
through the window of R. Pineda's
grocery on Montgomery avenue.
Steve Mecca's Mecca appears to be
the top floor of the Hall of Justice.
He made on* of his pilgrimages to
that place Sunday night. A woman
was at the bottom of his troubles, of
course, a lithographed circus rider on
a roster.
"Just when we had six bathers
boiled and ironed in the drying-room."
said L. Stradling of the Mason-street
Hammam Baths to Judge Mogan yes
terday, ""the Poppy Cafe dropped
about three gallons of dishwater down
on them.
"It wasn't to-day's dishwater,
either. It was some that Mrs, Punt,
who runs the Poppy, had been saving
for a month or so. One of the bath
ers awakened by the slop bath, shout
ed. "Cut out there. I. didn't order a
mud bath.' I want a warrant for
that woman for arson, or manslaugh
ter, or something:."
According to Stradling the presid
ing goddess of the Poppy is nettled by
his refusal to trade customers. "You
wash and I'll feed." suggested the
fair keeper of the resort with flowery
name. But Stradling refused.
Saturday night a group of bathers
lay slumbfrinjr on the drying counters.
From the skylight trickled a shower
bath. Judge Mogan granted a war
rant for Mrs. Punt on a charge of
malicious mischief.
"I don't see any storms coming
down the coast." replied the Judge.
"I think that in your case it will be
tunny weather for some time."
Gorham took the hint.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Gorham's wife, whose nose was
broken a few weeks ago by^ the hus
band who drinks only milk punches,
took the stand. "Those milk punches
broke up my home." she said. "They
are ruining the entire neighborhood."
"The court refuses to act as referee
for a bartenders' contest," said his
Honor, "but from what I have read
and heard and seen, milk punch con
tains some of that stuff â let's see, I'll
recall the name in a minute â oh. yes,
whisky. Under that innocent lacteal
fluid in the punch lurks the stuff that
biteth and stingeth. Without hesita
tion the court pronounces milk punch
an intoxicating beverage. Thomas,
why did you break your good lady's
nose?" t
"Well. Judge, I didn't exactly break
it." answered Gorham. "You see. we
had a little family party and I guess
la the excitement I must have handed
her one or two wallops. I didn't mean
anything. Everybody was having a
good time and I was feeling kind of
g-ood myself. I just broke it for a
joke, your Honor."
"You threatened to kill Mrs. Gor
ham with a stove lid. did you not?"
"That was just a little fun. your
Honor. Seems to me the old lady
can't take a joke any more. Maybe I
might have thrown the lid at her, but
she ought to know my ways after
twenty years of married bliss."
"Well, you pay your wife $10 a
week and keep away from her," or
dered Judge Mogan.
'"But," protested Gorham. "I'm a
shingler and I don't work during bad
weather."
"Mr. Gorham is a sober man," as
serted the detective. "He never
drinks anything but milk punches."
Milk punch has been proved a de
stroyer of homes. Detective Anthony
appeared before Judge Mogan as a
witness to the character of Thomas
Gorham and constituted himself at
torney for the defense of the seductive
beverage.
But the tillerman of the buzzcar
mentioned it several times at the top
of his voice. Croel was arrested. His
case will be tried on September 22.
Defrauding an automobile company
was the charge against L. J. Croel in
Judge Mogan's court. F. H. Stevens,
owner of the buzzcar, charges that
Croel hired the machine for an even
ing, then refused to pay.
Accompanied by two damsels fair,
Croel started out in the auto Satur
day night. They arrived at a Turk
street resort on Sunday morning.
There Croel thanked the chauffeur ef
fusively for the pleasant time. The
chauffeur said: "Don't mention It.
Thirty bones, please. "Don't mention
that either," replied Croel politely.
Judge Conlan continued the case in
order to hunt through the Penal Code
for the exact penalty for buttin' in.
"We was creepin* a waltz wid our
lady friends," explained the cotillon
leader of the club. "In , comes dis
geezer and makes googoo eyes at me
rag. I pays, 'On yer way, kido; didn't
yer pipe the sign on der door? It
says "No dogs!' Well, he wouldn't
tumble, so we trun him down the
stairs and gave him der boot. We
wants him soaked for buttin' in."
The "All In" Club, consisting of
three members, told Judge Conlan the
tale of an interrupted social function
given at Garibaldi Hall on Sunday
night. William Schaplin did the goat
act. on. the occasion. He butted in.
man. I no talkee He. Those two men
no good, allee same loafer."
"Five dollars or five days for at
tempting to defraud a trusting
heathen," decided the court.
With "The Beauty Shop" yet a
pleasant memory, the Fischer old
guard went last night to see what new
conceit had sprung from the intellec
tual activity of Crawford's strenuous
journalistic gray matter. They were
satisfied. For here is a refreshing
potpourri of gags, songs and dances,
all, even the last element, of a dis
tinct local flavor. With Arthur Del
roy's musical fantastics turned to
catch the jaded ear of even the habit
ual first night constituency and with a
sufficiently wide awake spirit of get
there on the part of the stage people,
"Miss Mazuma" went off with Si snap
that needed no wealth of floral pieces
nor calls for the author to emphasize
its obvious presence. The truly
Fischer piece is herein exemplified.
chorus girls with little red ladders
and little red hose â the latter in a
sartorial sense â came tripping : in to
answer an alarm and sing a littie song
with dance accompaniment before
looking for the blaze certainly the lo
cal Fire Department finds it "up to
them." But then it is all in the show
and it is a novelty â something not
lacking in Jim Crawford's latest "Miss
Mazuma."
Those that like that kind of thing will
like "The "Wizard of Oz," with which
the silly season was pleasantly in
augurated at the Columbia last night.
Doubtless we should have liked it bet
ter with the original cast. We're spoiled.
We are beginning to forget that San
Francisco was ever on the map of the
"road" show. The Columbia manage
ment must take the consequences of its
late brilliant dramatic campaign. It
has given us the best, and less than the
best will not content us.
The .piece itself â I see that Hamlin
& Mitchell decline to catalogue it â is
fascinatingly funny and attractive.
Scarecrows and mooley cows furnish
new joys in the cast. There is a re
alistic Kansas cyclone that makes one
glad to live in California, and fine ad
venturing of a Kansas motor man, an
"arm and check" syren, a small girl
and a cow, in the enchanted realm of
Oz. Then there is a chorus, "mostly
girls," that lives up to its description
of having been chosen for its youth
and beauty. The costumes are stun
ning. The scenery, transformation
scene and all, is sumptuous. The
music â oh, well, the music doesn't
matter. The people â well, some of
them matter. Vocally the cast has
about a voice and a half among them.
Blanch Powell Todd has most of It,
and Mildred Elaine and Florence Sin
not divide the rest. Not that any one
Of them worries much about using the
voice, but in this kind of thing only
a Tivoli-goer is unreasonable enough
to expect that.
The . way of the substitute is hard.
So much one has been led to expect,
for example, of the "Tin Woodman,"
as done by one Montgomery. John
Swor's tin man came as woodenly
last night as the figure should have
done and did not. On the other hand,
it is difficult to imagine that . Fred
Stone's scarecrow could have been
any better than Bert Swor's. He is
more like an animated dishclout than
it is possible to imagine without see
ing him. You cannot imag
ine even a three-foot hatpin
finding the bottom of his
straw stuffing. You wonder what he
has done with his bones â the limbs
bend like indiarubber â and with the
other part of his face, besides the
mouth. Make-up and acting, it is
the cleverest sort of work. This unc
tuous person when last here faced
George Wilson with the Haverly Min
strels' interlocutor. He cannot come
too often. The other men make one
hanker after Teddy Webb and Slmms
â except L. J. . Wyckoff and Fred
Woodward, as the courteous cow and
the cowardly lion, respectively. They
are the noblest beasts that were ever
lost to the zoo. Right here one may
pay. that no child should miss "The
Wizard" any more than the circus.
Blanch Powell Todd leads the ladies.
Miss Todd as Dorothy Gale from Kan
sas is a demurely pretty little person,
who sings prettily and wears satin knee
breeches as daintily as- Alice Nielsen.
She dances well â everybody dances well
in "The Wizard"â and is altogether en
gaging. Florence SInnot as the waitress
is a dancing marvel. She Is the most
featly-footed creature that has dawned
here for long. Miss SInnot almost
sings, and has a song, "Sammy," that
is going to fill the right-hand stage box
nightly. The song was directed thither
last night, to the obvious embarrass
ment of the "Sammy" addressed. May
Taylor has the part of a "lady lunatic,"
a comedy Ophelia, and is sometimes ef
fective and "always pretty. Those that
like that kind of thing will like "The
Wizard of Oz."
