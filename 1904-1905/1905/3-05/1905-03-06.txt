CHEMISTS DECLARE THAT MRS. STANFORD WAS POISONED
It is now absolutely certain that Mrs. Stanford died of strychnine poisoning. The report of
the chemists shows this conclusively. The autopsy revealed the heart, otherwise healthy, badly
swollen by assimilation of the poison, which quickly distributed through the system, not showing
in the stomach. The chemists also found a large quantity of strychnine in the bicarbonate of soda.

Assimilation of Poison Too Rapid to Affect
Stomach and Traces of It Are Very
Difficult to Discover.
Positive assurance is now in the possession of the local authorities that Mrs. Jane
Stanford's death last Tuesday in Honolulu was directly due to strychnine poisoning.
Yesterday afternoon, while impatiently awaiting- confirmation/if the previous infor
mation to this effect, published exclusively in Saturday .-morniiigV Call, a cablegram -
was receiveu Containing a synopsis of the report of the chemists, who had been engag
ed for the last three days in analyzing the deceased woman's stomach and other or
gans. Not only did the cablegram fully confirm The Call's interesting news, publish? v
ed the previous morning, but gave further details of the work performed by the men :

irding to the message, the chemists completed their work late Saturday after
l>ut (h'rUhul not to make their report public until to-day. The experts' firid
lorwarded to the local authorities are also to the effect that the chemists thor
lil\ analyzed the iM>ttle of bicarbonate of soda, from which 31rs. Stanford took a
deadlj potion, and found that strychnine was mixed all through its contents.
STRYCHNINE IS DISCOVERED IN THE ORGANS.
he stomach, kidneys and heart were also carefully examined by Chemists Shorcy and
the organs were bund to be in a very "healthy condition and much above those of
average woman of Mrs. Stanford's age. The autopsy that followed showed the strongest symp
r\ chnine poisoning, but no trace of strychnine was found by the chemists in the stomach.
lneys and heart were found to be in very good condition, but there was discovered
elling of the heart that the scientists declare would be only produced in death resulting from
rychnine poisoning. They agree that there is no longer any doubt of the cause of the death of
Stanford, and to this emphatic assertion the message adds that the autopsy failed to reveal
indications that would suggest any other cause for death.
DETECTIVES ARE MORE. CONFIDENT.
the local authorities, as already published exclusively in The Call, had received
ices regarding the finding of evidence of poisoning in the Stanford case, the detectives work
in the mysterious affair had become much disturbed in mind over the contradictory dispatches
ecetved from outside sources concerning the progress of the chemists' analyses and were begin- â¢
waver in their opinions a> to the merits of the case. When the detectives were made aware
fterday afternoon of the receipt of the message of confirmation they renewed their work in a
cotts manner that gives promise of hastening the solution of the mystery that is now attract
ing attention from all civilized parts of the world.
NEWS RELIEVES THE TENSION IN POLICE CIRCLES.
c flushed appearance of Captain of Detectives Burnett's face during the afternoon was
ale evidence of the important news he had received from Honolulu, and he seemed to realize
the fact. He. however, maintained his usual reticence and dodged making a statement to his in
terviewers on the ground that silence would best serve the ends of justice. Although the cable
gram from Honolulu stated that the report of the autopsy would be given out to-day, the hint
was dropped by one of the detectives that possibly it may be held until the arrival in Honolulu of
Captain Jules Callundan of Morse's agency and Detective Harry Reynolds of the regular force,
vho left here Saturday on the steamship Alameda.
DETECTIVES AWAIT CHANCE TO COMPARE THEIR DATA.
yesterday that the two detectives carried with them copies of the reports of
ill the detectives, both of the regular force and Morse's agency, who had been working on this
end of the Stanford poisoning case since the day after Mrs. Stanford took a portion of the pois
sof the bottle of Poland water. The purpose of taking these reports with them is
to familiarize themselves with all the details of the strange case during their trip down to the
is, so that they may be ready to take up the threads of the mystery there.
ime that Captain Callundan and Detective Reynolds return to San Francisco Cap
tives Burnett and his men will have thoroughly proceeded with the investigation of

say whether they are ready to make immediate arrests. Although the police

it to break.

IMPRESSIVE
SERVICES AT
THE CHAPEL
Rey.J.W. Dinsmore's Tribute
to Worth oi Noble
Character.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. March
s.â The memorial services over the
death of Mrs. Leland Stanford were
held this morning at 11 o'clock in the
Memorial Church at Leland Stanford
Junior University. The services were
conducted by the Rev. J. W. Dinsmore
from the First Presbyterian Church of
San Jose. They were of an impressive
character. The immense concresration.
composed to a large extent of the stu
dents of the university, listened with
deep attention to the eloquent dis
cou."se. The magnificent chapel never
appeared more impressive. The scolden
sunlight poured in through the stained
windows and cast a mellow glow over
the beautiful altar and the tall white
marble statutes of the twelve apostles
that stand in front of the reredos and
grace the side walls of the chancel.
The great organ rolled out its grand
est tones and lifted the beauty of its
music up to heaven. The processional
was entitled "Heaven" and was suns:
by a choir of fifty voices, in which the
whole joined, throwing out a tremen
dous volume of melodious sound. Fol
lowing this was sung the Lord's
Prayer, the congregation all devoutly
kneeling. The final hymn was "Life
Eternal."
Rev. Mr. Dinsmore said in part:
"The sermon I had purposed to give
here now has been laid aside. The
dreadful shock which has come to this
university and to the public at large
makes all discourse in this place at
this hour on any subject but one,
alien and impertinent. One subject,
and that to the exclusion of all else,
engages your minds and hearts, your
thoughts and feelings here now. I
speak of Mrs. Stanford.
"Perhaps there was no other person
in California who was known so famil
iarly to so many people as was Mrs.
Stanford. She was known far and
wide, in the mansions of the rich and
in the cottages of the. poor. In her
character there was no trace of vul
gar ostentation or of obtrusivenes*.
She was born a true woman, well born
and well bred. She had .hi*h ideals,
fixed principles and unfaltering perse
verance.
"She was a noble wife, blending her
life with that of her husband. She was
a devoted mother, giving the wealth of
a deep and powerful nature to her only
child while he lived and cherishing with
unspeakable tenderness his memory
after he had been taken from her. Her
absorbing ambitions, her masterful
aspirations had their soul and center

POLICE CAREFULLY INQUIRE
INTO DETAILS OF THE CASE
# With the hope that possibly some
further clew might be added to the
chain of circumstances now being
welded by the Police Department, the
detectives have been carefully tracing
every incident that marked the latter
days of Mrs. Stanford from the time
she returned from abroad to her de
parture on her fateful journey to
Honolulu. Yesterday the detectives
had advanced in their inquiries aa far
as her return to this city from her
San Jose visit, which followed the
poisoning episode at her California
street home. Arriving here, Mrs.
| Stanford and her secretary, Miss Ber-
I ncr, went to the St. Francis hotel,
I where rooms on the fifth floor were
I quietly engaged by the latter. They
j did not register and at the request of
! Mrs. Stanford there was assigned to
I them a special dining table in the la-
I dies' grill, where they daily took their
meals.
According to the information glean
ed by the detectives at the St. Francis
yesterday. Mrs. Stanford did not seem
to be deeply worried, but her secre

tary continually showed anxiety over
her mistress and endeavored to have
as much exclusiveness as possible for
the latter. The day the two women
arrived at the hotel Mrs. Stanford rec
ognized in one of the bellboys, who
had been directed to show her to her
apartments, the son of an old-time
friend of her late husband and after
greeting him kindly she suggested to
Miss Berner that she ask the hotel
management that the boy be permit

in the hotal. a request that was
promptly granted.

ford abstained from the use of min
eral water, to which she had been ac
customed up to the time that the poi
son had been found in her bottle of
Poland water at the California street
house, and drank only ice water,
which she ordered daily through the
bellboy. That there was something
troubling the mind of Miss Berner
soon became apparent to the bellboy,
for whenever he brought a pitcher
of ice water to Mrs. Stanford's room
Miss Berner would receive it and care

Miss Richmond Admits Tbat
Servants Indulged in
Quarrels.
PALO ALTO. March s.â Miss Eliia
beth Richmond this afternoon admit
ted that troubles had existed in the
Stanford household among the retain
ers. The private detectives have been
working to ascertain Whether the feud
might not have been directly or indi
rectly the cause of the attempted poi
soning.
"Jealousies existed in the Stanford
household among the employes," said
Miss Richmond, "but I cannot ex
actly term them an open rupture. As
far as the will and its bequests are
concerned I do not care to discuss thÂ«
subject, nor do I care about the matter
one way or the other.
"I fead very little to do with any of

not mean to imply that I quarreled
with the servants. I simply kept t&etn

The detectives made particular in

Jose, but went direct to the California
street home, where later Miss Berner

IN THE WORK OF CITY DETECTIVES
lends color to the undercurrent of opinion in police circles that the clew chasers are rapidly clos
ing in on the person guilty of the murder of Mrs. Stanford and that it needs only a few cable
words from Honolulu to bring the poisoner into the light.
SHERIFF HENRY DENIES REPORTS
THAT NO POISON HAS BEEN FOUND
Doctor Says Evidence Shows Strychnine Caused Death,
Even if Chemists Find None in the Stomach.
\
HONOLULU. March 5. â High Sheriff Henry emphatically denies that he ever said
r that Mrs. Stanford had not been poisoned. The rumor got about because of his reticence regarding
the case. He ha? been asked by the San Francisco police to observe as much secrecy as possible, conse
quently the story that he had no faith in the poisoning theory- gained credence.
It is believed here that the High Sheriff is confident that the wealthy California woman was
foully murdered, and that all messages he has sent to the San Francisco police are to that effect. The
results of the chemists' analyses are expected hourly. It is known that they are being withheld to give
time to the detectives who are seeking evidence in California.
Speaking of the case. Dr. George Herbert said this morning: "I am confident that Mrs. Stan
ford was poisoned by strychnine. Even if they find none in the stomach it will not dis
prove this fact. ' *
"From my experience with the poison, strychnine is quickly passed to the heart and kidneys,
and leaves few traces in the stomach. There were all the indications of strychnine poisoning in this
case.
"The position of the body at death was one indication. The corpse rested on the head and
heels, curving upward at the stomach, and the rigor of the spine was pronounced."
The inquest on the death of Mrs. Stanford will begin to-morrow afternoon. From indications
it will la<* for many days. Attorney General Andrews and Judge ' Stanley will appear for the police.
If the chemists report that death was caused by poisoning the inquest will probably be held behind
closed doors.
Sheriff Henry informed Miss Berner 10-day that $15,000 had been left to her by Mrs. Stan
ford's will. The young woman declared that the news was a complete surprise to her. She said
she did not know she would be remembered in the will.
Henry has subjected her to long and severe examinations, but he declares that he gained no
information that would give a clew to Mrs. Stanford's murderer.
-The Honolulu Advertiser says to-day: "It was reported yesterday that High Sheriff Henry
had said that no strychnine has been found in Mrs. Stanford's stomach." This statement is positively
denied by the official. He says: "I did not make such a statement. Mrs. Stanford's death occurred
under suspicion* circumstance*. I believe that she has been poisoned; and I have maintained the same
position from the first. "
There is little doubt here that the chemists are purposely delaying the report on their work.
When the local police and the San Francisco detectives' decide that it shall be given out a sensation
will undoubtedly follow.
risfi Beruer and May Hunt still keep to their rooms and refuse to be interviewed. They have
been under a terrible strain and show it.

ference to-day with Miss Berner, Mrs.
Stanfoi-d's secretary.
It is believed that unless there is
very positive proof of poisoning the
strongest efforts will be made to secure
from the Coroner's jury a verdict that
death was due to natural causes.
Judge Stanley, who is representing
the Stanford estate, and the Police
Department are apparently working
closely together.
Judge Stanley has been present at
moat of the interviews with Miss
Berner and Deputy Sheriff Rawlins.
There are some indications that ef
forts will be made to continue secrecy
and withhold the chemist's report un
til the steamer Alameda arrives from
San Francisco with representatives of
the Stanford estate and detectives.
Though High Sheriff Henry has re
peatedly promised to give out the find
ings of the chemists when made, it is
known that he has been in possession
of them since last night.
JSUss Berner is quite ill from the
strain of constant examinations and
the shock of Mrs. Stanfords death.

ALBANY, N. V., March s.â Ariel
Lathrop, heir to the Income of $1,000,000
of Mrs. Stanford's estate, does not be
lieve his sister was poisoned. He
stoutly defends the Chinese cook. Ah
Wing, and declares that so far as he
knows no employe of Mrs. Stanford's
would have harmed her. Incidentally,
Ariel Lathrop and Albany people who
were slightly intimate with Mrs. Stan
ford Bay she was a confirmed spiritual
ist. When Lathrop was told by a Call
correspondent of his inheritance by his
sister's will he expressed no surprise.
The fact that he had received a be
quest did not seem so important as the
report that Miss Bertha Berner had
pointed to the Chinese servant as the
one she suspected of having adminis
tered poison to her mistress.
'Poor Ah Wing is as innocent of
poisoning Mrs. Stanford as a new born
babe," said Lathrop. No one thought
more of her than that faithful Chinese
servant. Poison her? Why, he would
have laid down his life for her at any
time. 1 do not believe Mrs. Stanford
was ppisoned," was Lathrop's positive
declaration.
"I know of no one that could Dossi
bly gain through her death unless it
was some servant, and dispatches show
that the largest sum any servant re
ceived was $15,000 left to Miss Berner.
I believe the results of the investiga
tion will show that Mrs. Stanford was
not poisoned. It seems stranue to me
that the chemists are so slow in com
ing to a conclusion in their investiga
tions. Perhaps they are holding some
thing back."
Mrs. Lathrop confirmed her hus
band's report that Mrs. Stanford was a
spiritualist, citing in support of that
statement the fact that Mrs. Stanford
had told Mrs. Henry E. Highton, who
happened to be in Honolulu, that she
I had even thought at one time of hay
! ing a psychical department in Leland
' Stanford University. Mrs. Lathrop
â¢' herself had experiences in the line of
spiritualism with Mrs. Stanford, but
thinks the subject one too delicate to
discuss at this time. Friends of Mrs.
Stanford's living in this city tell most
interesting stories of her experience
with spiritualism and say positively
, ,that she was a confirmed believer in
.that faith.
They relate instances when Mrs.
Stanford was living in New York City
at the Fifth Avenue Hotel and the
Astor House. At that time she re
ceived frequent calls from Mabel Lor,
a medium, and also had many con
ferences with Rev. Mr. Newman and
his wife. There was also a medium
named Mrs. Stryker and a Miss Car
roll, who called regularly at Mrs. Stan
ford's apartments. Mr. Stanford him
self attended these spiritualistic se*
ances with his wife. Intimate friends
of Mrs. Stanford's say that Miss Ber
ner is a medium.
MRS. STANFORD LOYAL. TO ELKS.
Magnificent Gift to the Order Recalls
Friendship of Years.
The munificence shown by the late
Mrs. Jane Stanford to charity in her
will was generally commented upon
by the public yesterday, but none of
her gifts caused more talk than the
$10,000 bequest to the Benevolent and
Protective Order of Elks of this city.
Few probably knew of the deep inter
est the former generous mistress of
the California street majision took iri
the affairs of the Elks, whom she
always remembered each year by
sending to their annual memorial ser
vices a handsome floral piece as a
token of her sincere sympathy with
the charitable purposes of the order.
Mrs. Stanford's interests in the Blkfl
dated back many years, when her de
ceased brother, Harry Lathrop. was
a prominent member of the order, in
which he finally rose to the position
of Exalted Ruler. After the death of
Harry I>athrop she became a regular
contributor to the order and no floral
tribute to th<? departed was more con
spicuous on the platform at the me
morial services than the magnificent
piece sent by her. Charles G. Lathrop
is dilso a member of the Elks, a fact
which always seemed to please his
sister, who often mentioned it to her
friendP. In the esteem of the mera>
bers of the order no woman in Amer
ica stood higher than Mrs. Jane Stan
ford and no one will more deeply re
gret her sad ending than those who
knew of her friendship for them and
each year received her floral contri
bution.

These thoughts were only enhanced
I after the death of her husband. To
! this object her vast fortune was de
j voted without reluctance and without
, reserve. To carry out this purpose she
I gave this great landed estate, one of
â  the most magnificent in the world. She
! planned and paid for this great assem

"While other people were building

she rummaged the libraries, the gal

"The purpose of the Stanfords was

"It is not aione the marble and the

the great life-giving Influences that
make It a monument and a memorial.
It is this, this great life-giving influ

sity what it is. It is this life-giving in
fluence that will make this noble pile
live a monument forever.
"Millions and millions of people in
this country look upon the multi-mil
lionaire as a sort of highway robber
who gains his wealth and flaunts it
with ostentatious pride before the pecr
ple, as the result of having robbed it
away from the earnings of the poorer
classes and to the cost of the common
people. Many of these people. I have
no doubt, believe it is their passion and
their creed to think that by the multi
millionaire they have been robbed. To
ward these millions of people it has
caused unrest and distrust, and they
look forward to the time when there
shall be an ijpheaval and a downfall of
this class. If more of these so-called
multi-millionaires had devoted their
wealth in the manner in which the
Stanfords did. to build up an educa
tional institution like this, which
throws out nothing but goodness to
mankind and to the world, hatred and
malice would be turned to thoughts of
love.
"Here is founded one of the most
fully equipped educational Institutions
on the earth, where the child of the
humblest home may have the greatest
advantages at the least cost: where the
moral influences are in the highest de

many hundreds of the youth of the

Who could look upon her with mean

What had she ever done for the op

MUKDEN, March The rumble of
carts In the streets of Mukden is
drowned by the roar of the battle
which is raging a few miles away be
tween General Nogis Port Arthur vet
erans and the hastily assembled army
interposed by General Kuropatkin to
defend the city and railroad.
The stroke came like lightning out
of a clear sky. It is reported that the
situation has somewhat improved, but
it is still extremely critical. It is re
ported that the Japanese have been
thrown back in the district of Lunfan
shan and are retiring along the Sin
mintin road, but heavy fighting is con
tinuing there.
The Japanese vanguard posts are
â  - about six miles west of Mukden, where
the bursting of shrapnel is plainly vis
ible. A fight also is raging at Suchud
zia and Lanshanpau. which on Satur
day were captured by the Japanese
after a terrible combat, the villages
several times changing hands.
The Japanese on Friday advanced on
the Russian position at Shakhe village.
but were beaten off. Twice they at
tacked Putiloff, but both attacks were
repulsed.
At Oubenspousa a Japanese guard of
more than twenty battalions made
thirteen attacks on the night of March
o and the morning of March 4, storm
* it;g the redoubts furiously. All these
a' tacks were repulsed with heavy loss.
'i he ground in front of the redoubts
was strewn with heaps of Japanese
corpses.
HEAVIEST DUEL OF THE WAR.
The Japanese and Russian artillery
are engaged in the heaviest duel of the
%var. Russian mortars are fired at the
thakhe bridge and Japanese eleven
inch guns are in full play, but the Rus
i- Kian fortifications, on which the Rus
sians had been working all winter, of
fer fairly secure protection.
There is little news of General Kuro
patkin's operations on the extreme east
of the line. The Russians are holding
their ground and even advancing, but
it is reported that a Japanese cavalry
division, with twelve quick-fire guns, is
sweeping far to the eastward on a
rapid turning movement.
The carnage at the center and on both
Hanks has been enormous. The Japan
ese at many places simply threw away
their lives, beating against the Rus
sian powerful fortifications in attacks
which in the center apparently were
intended chiefly as a demonstration to
cover the driving home of General
Xogi's blow. It is believed now that
the operation to the eastward was in
I part in the nature of a feint, with the
design to draw reinforcements thither.
If this was the design it was success
ful. General Kuropatkin having sent
the First Corps to the assistance of
General Llcevitch. . .
RIGHT WING BENT BACKWARD.
As the result of the week's operations
the Russian right is bent sharply back
ward, instead of paralleling the Shakhe
River, and now runs northwest and
southeast, passing eight miles from
Mukden, covering the Sinmintin road.
According to prisoners, the Japanese
force on the Liao River Includes the
First, Seventh and Ninth divisions
from Port Arthur. Part of the turning
force probably is made up of reserves
which came from Yinkow by rail on
seven trains. The Port Arthur veter
ans advanced to the attack shouting in
Russian:
"Out of the way for us! "We are from
Port Arthur!"
They offered their lives with the
same fanatical bravery and were as
unshaken by heavy losses as at the
siege of Port Arthur.

OYAMA'S BATTLE LINE
RESEMBLES HUGE BOW
Its Ends Are Working Past the
Russian Flanks.
TOKIO. March 6. 11 a. m.â lt is re
ported that the Japanese advance left
has captured a position of high ground
four miles south of Mukden and that
fighting continues. Outside of head
quarters nothing definite is known re
garding events since Saturday. It is
reported that the Russians are show
ing lack of co-ordination and co-opera
tion in meeting Japanese movements.
TOKIO, March 6.â Field Marshal
Oyama is continuing his great drive
around both flanks of the Russian
army. Oyama's front now resembles
a huge bow, with its base on the
Shakhe River. His right arm reaches
a point east of Fushun. His left arm
extends to a point west of Mukden.
He is steadily tightening his great
chord of men of steel while General
Kuropatkin Is striving desperately to
check the Japanese advance, contest
ing their flank encroachments and
hammering their center. The Japanese
are making heavy gains west of the
railway and have captured great quan
tities of stores. There has been bloody
fighting and the heavy losses will be
vastly Increased when the masses of
infantry meet. Oyama, reporting yes
terday, said:
"A few days ago our force in the
direction of Sengching pressed the
enemy Into his position at Tita. which
is fifteen miles southeast of Fushun.
and at Manchuntun, fifteen miles south
of Fushun. An engagement continues
in the direction of the Shahke River.
"On the night of March 3 the enemy
made four determined attacks aerainst
our positions at Housuntapotzu and
Tangshiatun. All of his attacks were
entirely repulsed.
"In the district east of the railway
the enemy's frequent small attacks
were all repulsed. In the district west
of the railway our force, continuing
its fierce attacks, has occupied the dis
tricts of Wuchenying, five miles west
of Shahke village; Laishenpao, three
miles northwest of Wuchenvine. and
Phuhopao, the terminus of the new
railway which has been constructed by
the Russians.
"Our force on the right bank of the
Hun River, after dislodging the enemy
from his position northeast of the
Siaopei stream, which is between the
Hun River and the Liao River, has ad
vanced to the north. This force car
ried the defense line of the enemy be
tween Changtan and Sufanetai and
then fiercely pursued the enemy. The
line is now between Wochiapo, fifteen
miles southwest of Mukden: Tatzupao.
thirteen miles west of Mukden, and
Lamuho, which is four miles north of
Tatzupao.
"During the previous enjragement the
casualties of the enemy were heavy.
TVe captured a great quantity of spoils,
but we have not as yet had time to
investigate them. We also captured
large quantities of provisions at Wan
changpao and a considerable auantitv
of clothing at the depot of Tahantai."
VICTORY OR A ROIT.
Kuropalkln's Fate Depends Upon Re
sult of To- Day's Fighting.
ST. PETERSBURG, March 6. â The
fate of General Kuropatkin and his
army hangs in the balance to-day, de*
pending on the retult of the fighting
almost in the outskirts of Mukden.
According to reports this morning
the flsrhtinn: went wel! for the Rus
sians, who beat back. the wave that
threatened to roll over Mukden as it
did over the fortifications of Port
Arthur; but nothing is known as to
what is going on beyond the line of
breakers â whether part of General
Nogl's force is in full career for Tie
Pass or whether the Japanese have
staked all in a cast against Mukden.
The imminence of the peril on the
west wing has withdrawn attention
from the operations on the center,
where the fighting has been extreme*,
ly heavy, and on the left especially,
where the Japanese gains are suffi
ciently great enough to cause appre
hension. Military critics here point
out that the Japanese have put them
selves in a critical position by the ex
treme extension of their lines, laying
themselves open, as they did at Liao
yang, to the possibility of a most ef
fective counter stroke and' probable
defeat if General Kuropatkin should
be able to launch a column against a
weak link in the chain.
In other respects the situation also
resembled that at Liaoyang, the Jap
anese making: a costly demonstration
to hold the Russians in their fortifica
tions on the center and throwing away
the lives of thousands in order to give
the flanking: force opportunity to ad
minister a telling blow.
A feature of all accounts of the fight
ing reaching St. Petersburg is the em
phasis laid on the awful carnage.
There is reference after reference to
dead piled high on the ground over
whi'-h an attack was delivered, strew
ing breastworks, alm6st hiding abatis
from sight and even being used by the
Japanese to construct hasty entrench
ments. The Russian losses on both
flanks are conceded to be enormous,
but it is claimed that the defenders
of the center suffered comparatively
little by the Japanese bombardment
and in beating off the Japanese at
tack.
The attacks delivered by General
Nogi's soldiers were marvelous, in view
of the forced marches which they made
for five or six days, recalling the rec
ords of Stonewall Jackson's "Foot Cav
alry." They entered the battle with
the greatest dash and fought day after
day with vigor, but those of them who
were taken prisoners dropped to the
ground utterly exhausted and hardly
able to speak. They had not eaten for
two days, which accounts in part for
their utter fatigue.
General Kuropatkin's line of com
munication has not been touched,
though it is in extreme Jeopardy. His
right flank is bent so sharply back that
It may necessitate the abandonment of
the Putiloff and Novgorod hills, to
which the Russians still firmly cling.
The Japanese possibly are pushing
northward at tangents with both
flanks.
A hopeful sign is the postponement
until to-morrow of the grand council
of war. which was to have met at Tsar-
Kkoe-Selo to-day. This lends color to
reports that the general situation has
somewhat improved. The pnimnii was

called to discuss the retirement on Tie
Pass, but the action of the Japanese
has made a successful retreat far more
difficult than that at Liaoyang, where
but one flank was rolled back.
A flood of dispatches came through
to-day, but they were mostly old, re
ferring to the firing on the left flank
and General Linevitch's losses, which
have been largely described.
NOGI'S WARRIORS UNFED.
Continue tlie Battle With Their
Haversacks Empty.
MUKDEN, Saturday. March A.â
Guns began firing at 1:30 o'clock this
afternoon to the west and northwest,
indicating the beginning of the battle
by General Nogi, notwithstanding the
terrible work of the past three days
and the confirmed report that his
troops have not eaten for two days.
Up to Friday evening the positions
on the Shakhe River remained un
changed. The Japanese everywhere
sustained severe losses. The thirteenth
charge against Kaotu Pass was beaten
off at 8 o'clock on Friday morning. In
the storming of Sandepas the Japanese
advanced to the wire entanglements,
where they were checked and thrown
back.
The tenth charge at Kandolesan, on
the Russian left wing, was beaten
back at 4 o'clock this morning.
An artillery duel has been raging
since morning to the westward of
Mukden and the Japanese shells are
exploding within three miles of the
imperial tombs. The line of the Jap
anese advance guard extends about
seven miles parallel with the railroad.
Scattered Chinese villages, which are
practically the only shelters in this
open plain, are j^eiving the particular
attention of the gunners.
Throughout the day the Russian bat
teries replied vigorously to the Japan
ese fire and the exchange of shrapnel
has been terrible. The wnole of the
fire zone is obscured by dense white
smoke from exploding missiles.
SURPRISINGLY RAPID ADVANCE.
Russians Believe Their Foe Utilized
a Chinese Railroad.
MUKDEN, Friday, March 3.â The
beginning: of the withdrawal of the
Russian right flank on March 1 pre
cipitated a battle at Chantan, west of
Sandepas, when the right flank was
ordered to fall back, fighting, to Tao
taitzu, near Nataran. On March 3 the
Russians captured some machine guns
and took a number of prisoners of Gen
eral Nogi's Port Arthur army. The
Russians lost extensively, although
they destroyed an entire Japanese regi
ment before Chantan with shrapnel
and burned all the forage in the vil
lages north of the Hun River.
The Japanese attacked Chantan from
Sandepas simultaneously with an as
toundingly rapid advance from Liao
yang, the impression being that the
Chinese Sinmintin Railroad was being
employed by them as a line of com
munication.
The combatants confront each other
now for a distance of six and a half
miles west, the Japanese, it is believed,
having three divisions and the most
theatrical and bold event of the war is
imminent. The Russians consider the
situation as very favorable to them on
account of the great extension of the
Japanese line.
There Is the greatest activity at
Mukden. All the streets and outlying
roads are crowded with transports of
the army, which have been assembled
to oppose General Nogl. The events of
the last three days have electrified the
entire army.
The fighting at Putiloff Hill and on
the center closed at dark on Thursday,
when it was confined chiefly to the
west, where the Japanese are c iupying
Sinmintin. Two companies also dashed
up the Mukden road from Sifangtai
v knout being arrested, though the Cos
sacks had been in touch with the Jap
anese advanced posts for two days.
On March 2 several divisions gave
battle west of Mukden, from which
city the bursting of shrapnel could
plainly be seen. Mukden, which was
thrown into confusion, recovered to
day when It became known that the
Japanese had been repulsed.
The prisoners captured show that the
Imperial Guards Division, formerly of
General Kuroki's army, with a few
other troops, made the two attacks of
the last sixty hours on the Russian
center, which have already been re
ported, and kept up a furious demon
stration while the Japanese flanks
pushed back the Russian right and left
flanks.
The Russian casualties on March 1
end 2 are reported to have been 100 in
the center, while the Japanese are be
lieved to have lost more than 1000. In
formation obtained indicates that only
three divisions of the Japanese army
an- engaged and it is believed that a
formidable force of Japanese it on the
way to Tie Pass.
MORE SHIPS CHARTERED.
TACOMA, March 5.â A large num
ber of extra steamships are being
chartered to rush across the Pacific
supplies of many kinds to Japan. The
great steamship Minnesota, four Jap
anese liners and the big freighters of
the Boston Steamship Company run
ning from Tacoma are insufficient to
carry to Japan the immense ship
ments of barley, flour, meat products
and other supplies now piling up at
Puget Sound ports.
One firm has chartered the steam
ships Ocean Monarch, Nairn, Foreric

SAYS SPIRITS
CAN BE RAISED
Bishop Fallows Expresses
His Belief in Apparitions
of Persons Who Have Died
HE GIVES INSTANCE
Eminent Churchman Draws
a Line Between the False
Medium and the True One
Special Dispatch to The Call.
CHICAGO, March s.â Bishop Fal-
lows is a believer in apparitions and
believes it possible that mediums exist
who can materialize spirits at will.
This was the tenor of a direct state
ment contained in an interview riven
to-night after a sermon on "True and
False Spiritualism."
In his sermon the eminent church
man condemned in unmeasured terms
the practices of fraudulent spiritualists
and censured such practices as the
manufacture of "spirit pictures" of
Christ.
"That the dead exist in spirit and
will communicate with the livine has
been proved," said Bishop Fallows.
"My father and mother separately saw
the apparition of a young man who
died in England. My parents were not
superstitious people, either.
"Of the thousands of mediums in the
country I believe it possible that there
are some who can cause the spirits of
the dead to appear at will. I should
most assuredly not venture to dispute
those wonderful phenomena, many of
which admit of no other explanation.
I believe that some of these genuine
manifestations are supernormal â that
is, they are visible, only to certain per
sons, but exist nevertheless."
The sermon preached to-day by
Bishop Fallows at St. Paul's Re
formed Episcopal Church was in par*
as follows:
"There are genuine spiritualistic
phenomena without doubt. Otherwise
the Bible itself would be untrue. But
it is, I think, perfectly safe to say that
no more than one in a thousand cases
connected with the vast number of
seances in this country is worthy of
credence.
"A day or two ago a photograph of
Christ was placed in my hands, for
which it was claimed he sat before the
camera of a Chicago medium. The
height of sacrilege and deception has
been reached. If ever money was ob
tained under fraudulent pretense it has
been secured In innumerable instances
by these false mediums. The harvest
which has been reaped, both from rich
and poor, by these mendacious traffick
ers in the deepest and holiest senti
ments of mankind has been a eolden
one."
FAKE MEDIUM EXPOSED.
Sennce in New York Turned Into a
Battle Royal.
NEW YORK, March 5.â A spiritual
istic fraud was exposed to-night when
Mrs. Herrman, a materializing medi
um, was dragged shrieking from her
cabinet and tossed into the center of a
circle of dupes attending the seance in
her apartments. She was a most sub
stantial spirit, weighing at least 300
pounds, and she fought like a trapped
tigress. Furniture was smashed, men
knocked down and glass broken before
Mrs. Herrman and her husband were
finally captured.
When the gas jets were ignited the
woman was found gasping in the cen
ter of the seance room, clad in a mass
of gauze, coated with phosphorescent
paint. Half of her spiritual garb and
her headpiece were in the possession
of Calvert Berwick, a Virginian, who
made the exposure.
The exposure was the most sensa
tional and complete ever made in this
city. Berwick's cousin, Harrison Grind
ley, was with him at the seance, and
struck a light while the fight was go
ing on in the cabinet. Immediately
half a dozen or more confederates at
tacked Grindley and Berwick and
fought to prevent the medium being
dragged into the seance room. A bat
tle followed and it was not until they
had knocked several men down that
they were able to flood the room with
light.
CHINA LODGES A TROTEST. '
Accuses the Japanese of a Breach of
Neutrality.
TOKIO, March 5. â It is understood
that the Chinese Government has
lodged a protest with the Japanese
Government in which it is alleged that
the neutrality of Sinmintin has been
infringed by the operations there and
thereabouts of the Japanese army.
The Japanese Government has not in
dicated what attitude it will take with
regard to this protest, but it is exoect
ed that in its reply to China it will de
clare that Japan Is bound to respect
the neutrality of North China only so
long as Russia does, and that the
presence of the Russians at Sinmintin
has created a condition of bellieer*
ency. The operations of her forces
at Sinmintin, it is expected Japan will
point out, was and is a strictly mili
tary necessity for the protection of
Japanese rights and interests.
CARRIED SEAWARD BY ICE.
Blockade Runners May Escape Cap
ture by Japanese.
TOKIO. March 5. â It is believed
here that the unknown steamships
which have been imprisoned in the
ice fields north' of the island of Hok
kaide have been carried seaward,
where it is probable that the break
ing of the noes will result in liberating
the vessels.
There Is no trace of the Northwest^
crn Steamship Company's Tacoma,
concerning which various rumors have
been afloat. It is believed that this
vessel is short of coal and that unless
r.*e can speedily reach Vladivostok or
some oither port she is in danger of
being rendered helpless.

and Tie Pass total slightly more than

with 1504 suns. These estimates do
not include the Vladivostok and other
garrisons, the rairoad guards or the
civil employes. The grand total of
the Russian strength east of Baikal is
estimated at 700,000 men.

INDIANAPOLIS, Ind.. March 5.â
Brigadier Generals Frederick D. Grant
and Frederick Funston will be disre
garded by President Roosevelt when the
next major general is to be appointed,
and an Indiana man, Brigadier Gen
eral Frank D. Baldwin, formerly colo
nel of the Fourth Infantry, is to be ele
vated to the higher rank. The intima
tion that President Roosevelt is to turn
down the hero of Calumpit and the son
of the great Civil War leader came
from Washington in a letter to State
Senator Klmbrough of Muncie, who is
anxious that General Baldwins meri
torious war record be recognized.
Baldwin has been the only American
soldier to receive two medals from
Congress and consideration of his ex
cellent service in command of the
Fourth Infantry in the Philippines led
President Roosevelt to favor him, it is
said.
GENERAL KAULBARS WOUNDED.
Commander of Second Manchurian
Araiy Is in Hospital.
LONDON, March 6. â The Daily
Telegraph's correspondent at Tokio
cables that the Japanese Colonel Him
mida was killed at the capture of Sei
kajo and that General Kaulbars, com
mander of the second Manchurlan
army, was wounded and sent to the
hospital at Mukden.
The correspondent adds that 10,000
Russian troops are reported to be at
Laopion, twenty-five miles south of
Sinmintin, and that General Mist
chenko has had a disagreement with
General Kuropatkin and Is returning
to Russia.
The correspondent in St. Petersburg
of the Times snys:
"Russian war correspondents express
the greatest wonder at the irresistible
and frenzied rushes of the Japanese
infantry. Russian critics are sur
prised at the boldness and skill of
Japanese strategy of timing the on
slaught when the winter has ended
but the rivers are still icebound."

Japanese had captured Suchudzla and
Lanshenpro the same day, while their
attacks on Putiloff Hill and thirteen
fierce assault on Kandolesan were re

morning in the direction of Suchudzia.
"All is quiet on the center, except in
the Shakhe zone, which the Japanese
attacked during Friday evening, creep
ing up to the wire entanglements of
our fortifications and hurling hand
grenades. The attacks, however, were
soon repulsed without succeeding in
damaging the entanglements.
"The Japanese guard during Friday
evening continued its attack on Kan
dolesan and the tenth attack was re
pulsed at 4 o'clock this morning. Jap
anese corpses are piled high against
our earthworks.
"The enemy's attack against the
Gaotu Pass position was suspended
toward Friday evening, but a renewal
of It is expected.
"Their operations on our left flank
also were suspended on Friday even

anese troops opposite Kldiadzu were
falling back.
"Major General Schatiloff and Col

attacks have since been suspended.
"Two attacks on the Kutilini posi

SbklÂ«l Dispatch to To* Call.
PHILADELPHIA, Pa., March 5.â
Mayor Weaver and the city govern
ment of Philadelphia were publicly
prayed for to-day In nearly all Evan
gelical churches of this city. Neither
In the memory of living men or In thÂ«
history of the City of Brotherly LovÂ»
Is there any record of a campaif^i like
this. The clergymen who are aiding
.the Citizen's Committee of Seventy and
Committee of Eight In the effort to
stamp out the vicious conditions toler
ated by the municipal authorities arc
now trying to bring about a great re
ligious revival like that which recently
brought 30,000 sinners to repentance In
Denver. There is no trace of bitter
ness in the prayers directed at Mayor
Weaver and his administration.
Mayor Weaver, asked to reply, said:
"This subject comes under the head
of public business, and I have made it
a rule from the beginning not to dis
cuss public affairs on Sunday."
He did not seem disturbed by the
fact that scores of pastors were ad
dressing earnest petitions to God to
change his methods in administering
the affairs of Philadelphia.
The use of prayer as a weapon
against the city government of Phila
delphia seems all the more remark
able when one considers that Mayor
Weaver is an active and earnest
church worker. He was in his usual
place this afternoon, as he has been
every Sunday for years, as leader of a
Bible class In the Tioga Temple Baptist
Church. No stress of political cam
paigning nor pressure of official duttee
has ever caused him to miss one Sun
day.

YOUTH DROWNS
AFTER FALLING
Alfred O'Brien Drops From
Bowsprit, Hits an Anchor
and Is Headend Helpless
ALAMEDA, March s.â While at
tempting to climb up to the bowsprit
of the ship Euterpe, in the estuary near
the United Engineering Works this
afternoon, Alfred O'Brien,. 19 years old,
fell fifteen feet, struck upon the fluke
of an anchor, dropped into the chan
cel and was drowned. - Arthur Horn
of S9l Oak street. William Lane of 912
Park street and Herbert E. Evans of
2"01 Clinton avenue were with O'Brien
when he lost his life. Horn dived from
a small boat and succeeded in dragging
the limp form of his companion to the
eurface, but was unable to swim with
him to a place of safety and was forced
to relinquish his hold on the drowning
youth 'for fear of being pulled down
himself. O'Brien was an expert swim
mer, but it is thought tnat he was
rendered helpless when he hit the
anchor fluke. The body was recovered
this evening.
O'Brien was a native of this city and
the son of Mrs. Annie O'Brien of 1105
Court street. He was a brother of
Charles O'Brien, who was the fireman
en the narrow-gauge train that ran
through the Webster-fctreet'draw into
the estuary fifteen years ago, when
many lives were lost. Since that time
the fireman has never been seen and
hit relatives do not know what has
become of him. The boy was also a
brother of Miss Ella O'Brien, formerly
one of th* brightest teachers in the
local school department, who later be

OAKLAND EVANGELISTIC MEETINGS
ARE BEGUN WITH GREAT ENTHSIASM
Rev. J. W. Chapman of Philadelphia and Other Famed
Speakers Hold Impressive Services.
OAKLAND, March 6.â Fifteen hun
dred men took part this afternoon in
a remarkable meeting at the First
Congregational Church, which inaugu
rated in Oakland the great evangelistic
revival that has been sweeping over the
United States. This is a reflex of the
extraordinary religious movement be
gun two years ago in the Antipodes,
extending throughout the British Isles,
thence to this country and working
steadily westward to the shores of the
Pacific. For a year the pastors of
Oakland have been preparing for the
visit of the notable band of Christian
workers, who have been preaching the
gospel throughout the land. Not since
the days of the great Moody has the
religious world been stirred as by the
labors of the men who to-day began
their campaign in this city. The local
clergymen have entered into the work
no less enthusiastically than their
brethren, whom they welcomed to-day
after the long march across the conti
nent.
The campaign in Oakland will cover
two weeks and calls for five service*,
each week night except Saturday, with
special meetings on Sundays at five
churches in the districts into which the
city has been divided. In the central
portion the meetings will be at the
First Congregational Church and the
First Presbyterian Church. For East
Oakland the Twenty-third avenue
Baptist and the Eighth avenue Metho
dist churches have been selected. At
West Oakland the meetings will be
held at the Chester street Methodist
Church. Meetings will also be held
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
afternoons at 3 o'clock. Large chorus
choirs have been organized in each
church to assist with the music, a note
worthy feature of which will be the
solo work by the singing evangelists
in the visiting party.
THE FIRST MEETING.
The Rev. J. Wilbur Chapman con
ducted the big meeting this afternoon
at the First Congregational Church.
With him was Fred Butler, a basso of
much power, and Charles Allen chor
ister, who led the choir and congre
gational singing. Pastors of nearly all
the evangelical churches occupied seats
on the platform. The R<>v. Ernest E.
Baker of the First Presbyterian Church
opened the meeting. Prayer was
offered by the Rev. Thomas A. Bover.
of the First Christian Church. I Dr.
Baker said: \
Tne pastors of Oakland united in a confer
ence a year ago to arrange for this campaign.
We have come together to n#esent Jeaus Christ
to the men and the womrn of Oakland. From
the East have come reports of the wonderful
work that has been done by our brethren, and
it is our one great desire to have the same
blessed results here.
Dr. Chapman, forceful, clean cut,
sympathetic and heart-reaching, led
the great audience of men in the reci
tation of the twenty-third Psalm, "The
Lord is my shepherd. " He brought his
hearers into restful touch by a prelude
to his discourse, during which he said:
This remarkable gathering tells ua that these
are days of revival. God is certainly moving
In the world. Let every Christian man put
aside his cares and worries, and call all of his
brethren to the servio? of God. Ask them to
come. If they don't want to hear the preach
ing:, tell them to come and hear the Pinging.
We will take care of them after they get horc.
NO FEAR OF THE JUDGMENT.
For the text of his sermon. Dr. Chap
man read from Hebrews 9:27: "It is
appointed unto man once to die. But
after this the judgment." The evan
gelist said he had chosen that text be
cause it was one that would make men
think. He continued:
There is no reason why a Christian need
fear the Judgment. If I could prove to you
that before this week ends you would be called
upon to face your conscience, your record and
your God, there Is not a man In this ehur.-h
who would turn to his business toni' now
morning The very thought of the Judgment
makes men think. No man can escape It. It
1b personal and because it makes men think 1*
the reason I have taken this text.
The easiest person In all this world to lead
to Christ Is a man. Some of you may not
agree with me. Some of the preachers may
not agree with me, hut I know men and 1
know their s-in? atui their temptations and their
troubles, not all by personal experience, but
by personal contact. Men can he brought to
ChriPt if they will think, and I say this text
will make them think.
Eternity! Where will you spend It?
I hear men say they do not join the church
bra use thorÂ» are hypocrites In the church.
That Is not true. That Is not what keeps
them out of the church. There are hypocrites
in the church, but there are also many noblt.
men and women, and I count now your moth
ers and y>ur wivt-9 as more than balancing all
of the hypocrites you or I will ever find in the
church.
The Judgment Is a place of meeting. You
are going to meet your conscience, and your
conscience is that which approves when you
â¢re right and disapproves when you are wrcng.
It is that which causes your face to flush and
heart to heat like a trip-hammer when you
ere in Fin.
At the meeting's close Dr. Chapman
met many of his hearers personally.
The Rev. Robert F. Coyle of Denver
and John H. Elliott conducted services
this afternoon at the Second Congre
gational Church. Charles E. Rykert
was soloist and chorister.
EVENING SERVICES.
Services were held in the five ap
pointed churches this evening. Dr.
Chapman preaching at the First Con
gregational Church. During his dis
course he said:
God is no respecter of persons. This is
true of cities as well as of individuals. The
fact that God has movtd Atlanta, Denver and
Los Angeles indicates his willingness to move
Oakland. God is no respecter of persons as
to the Judgment of sin. He rebukes both the
high and the low, and he is no respecter of
persons as to the gift of pardon. The poor
fallen girl on the streets Is as welcome to
the gift of God as the woman clad in silks.
P't^r's story of Jesus embraced his whole
Hfe from the manger to the throne. This Is
my purpose. I will present him to you living
Jn Nazareth to prove his sympathy for you,
working in Galilee as presenting to you a
great Ideal, dying on the cross as your sub-
Ftitute, raised the third day with power and
Judging the world at the last great day.
There are some things I cannot do and
you have not sent for me to do them. I can
not preach along denominational lines. I am
a denomiuationalist. but here first, last and
all the time, I am a Christian. I cajinot
preach so as always to please you. tiie
Eklllful surgeon must some time, use the
knife. I cannot gather the results â an.
evangelist is not a reaper, he is the proclaim
er of glad tidings â but if the people of Oak
land will be in sympathy with me ajid will
give me their support whatever the condi
tions of the weather may be or whatever
other engagements may entice them away, I
can absolutely pledge a great ingathering of
such as shall be saved.
There are some things I know I can do.
T can show you where you are wrong. I can
impress you with your responsibility for
others I can bring back the visions of other
days when you knew Christ Intimately and
I can lead you to Christ if you will but listen
to my message and take heed.

THE GREAT REVIVAL MOVEMENT WHICH IS NOW IN PROGRESS IN
THE PROTESTANT CHURCHES OF OAKLAND.
Street Methodist Church John H. El
liott and Charles E. Rykert, singer,
conducted the evening meeting.
Long before the hour appointed for
the meeting at the First Presbyterian
Church to-nipht crowds were pourinp;
Into the church. When the meetine
began i'v-ry seat in the preat audi
torium was filled and the ushers were
turning late roniers into the overflow
meeting, which was conducted by the
Rev. H. H. Wintler in the chapel of
the church.
The Rrv. Henry Ostrom conducted
the opening meeting, the subject of his
sermon being â¢Revivals." He told of
the revivals in every day life: the re
vivals on th* 3 farm for seed time, re
vivals in political times and revivals
In the schools at the time of gradua
tion. After calling attention to these
unnoticed revivals the evangelist said:
Is it: then any wonder that :we call' the
people of the churches to a revival, of religion?
We want no mere excitement, no mere Intoxi
cation, no â¢ fuss, ' we want the tonic, ; the | food,
the power so that men shall have moral muscle
and put it to use for the rood â¢ of; his â¢ neigh
bors We want It to be Â«aller.for s the grocer
to collect his bills and harder to start a fami
ly 'quarrel- at the breakfast f table, we , want
the sense of God. â¢-.'â ;
You will notice that this great revival in
terest now sweeping over Wales and England
and America is a â  revival of Bible ; study. It
must be so to be worth < 'consideration. i> We
have forgotten in these days < the cost of this

A LEADER OF MEN.
Dr. J. Wilbur Chapman, who leads
the corps of evangelists in this national
movement, is one of the foremost work
ers In the Christian world. He volun
tarily took up evangelical labors thir
teen years ago when he resigned the
partorate of Bethany Church of Phil
adelphia, which had a membership of
3000 and a Sunday school enrollment
of 5000. During his three years' service
In that church ICOO persons were added
10 the membership roll, of whom a ma
jority were men. With a peculiar gift
of reaching men Dr. Chapman sur
rendered his pastoral relations and de
cided to go into the world as a preacher
of the Gospel. He has made a remark
able record. Despite many calls that
have been made to him from leading
churches in America and In England
Dr. Chapman has continued in his
chosen field, believing that here he
could accomplish most for the cause
of religion.
Fred Butler, the soloist who accom
panies Dr. Chapman, is not less a nota
ble character among the band of men
who are stirring this city with religious
zeal. A year ago Butler was using
his talents as a member of the Grau
opera Company. He gave up the staire.
the money, the glamour and the gayety
t<- go into the work of saving souls.
Ie Dr. Chapman's immediate corps Is
Charles Allen, the chorister, an ener
getic, magnetic leader, who will handle
all of the chorus work during the meet
ings at the First Congregational
< hurcn. Among the songs will be the
"Glory Song," which has been carried
throughout Rngland during the great
revival campaigns there.
Dr. Henry Ostrom, who will conduct
the meetings at the First Presbyterian
Church, is a preacher of great elo
quence. His chorister. J. P. Hillis. will
lead the chorus of 150 voices, Including
! the regular trained choir of that
church.
The pastors' committee has arranged
for overflow meetings as they shall be
necessary. At least one will be held
this week In the Macdonough Theater.

FEATHERS MAKE
A PLAIN TRAIL
Chicken Stealing Laid at
Door of a Fraternity
House in Uniyersity Town
POLICE HEAB COMPLAINT
Neighbors of Phi Gamma
Delta Men Miss Poultry and
Suspect Collegians of Theft
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, March 5.
So simple a circumstance as a trail
of chicken feathers leading from the
yard of a neighbor to the steps of the
Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house on
Dana street has led to the suspicion
on the part of the police that epicurean
appetites may have tempted the fra
ternity youths to fracture several of
the ten commandments, including those
which forbid coveting the possessions
of one's neighbor or of laying violent
hands upon his goods.
Complaint was made to the police to
day by L. H. Shaw, residing at 2224
Dana street, that six fine fowl had
been stolen from the poultry depart
ment of the establishment last night.
The squawking of the captive fowl
was audible near the midnight hour,
but no attempt was made at that time
to apprehend the poachers on the Shaw
preserves.
This morning, however, when the
fowl were found to have been taken,
search was begun and with the assist
ance of Deputy Marshal Carey a trail
was established that led straight to
the doors of the exclusive and aristo
cratic fraternity youths' building, ad
joining the Shaw mansion. Xo S.
Holmes deductions were required to
convince the indignant owner of the
poultry reservation that the Phi
Gamma Delta lads feasted on chicken
either last night or to-day, the feast
being at the expense of the Shaw
household, which fancied that it con
tributed the piece de resistance in the
form of six big, fat and thoroughly
edible chickens.
No attempt was made to continue
the investigation begun by the Deputy
Marshal into the fraternity house of
the Phi Gamma Delta men. but it is
said that the case will not be dropped,
niembers of the Shaw family being de
termined that the depredators on their
premises shall be made to suffer.
Three years ago fraternity circles
were stirred by Marshal Kearns' work
in fastening a chicken-stealing offense
upon theSigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity
men. At that time the bloody stains
on the way to the fraternity house
from the chicken yard that had been
despoiled provided the clew which the
officer followed.

AND RETURN FOR REPAIRS
Ocean Is Too Narrow for Two Schooners

EVA AND BUENAVENTURA ARE DISMASTED
The combined gross tonnage of the

I â¢ '\' tona, and yet
i he nipht of Marck
ier a clear sky and in fair
weather, found the breadth of the
broad Pacific too narrow for them to
yaes each other. They came halting;
: esterday, tattered, torn and
dismantled, the skipper of each blam
ing the captain of tne other for the
undoing of both vessels.
ThÂ« San Buenaventura's bobstav.

The Eva ie in worse plight, for she
lost her mixren-mast and with its fall
'. r.e broken etick brought down all the
rigging and gear depending upon It.
The San Buenaventura left here Feb
ruary 23 for Tillamook and had only
reached latitude SB.S6, longitude 124.50,
when the collision occurred which sent
her back for repairs. The Eva left
Eureka for thie port four days aso and
had on board 250.000 feet of lumber.
Both captaine yesterday Rave ver

uzne was li p. m. and the nierht was

Captain Ivengard of the San Buena
ventura said what he had to say in
lew words.
"I was on the starboard tack. The
schooner Eva was running before the
â wind. She ran into the San Buena
ventura aiiQ carried away the bob
stays, martingale and head gear."
Like a good soldier, the San Buena
ventura wears all her scars in front.
Captain Bjornstrom of the Eva goe*
into more detail. He says:
"We were running with the wind
about two points on the port quarter.
1 was below asleep, when Clarence
Brown, my second mate, called me.
At that inetant I heard the crash of
the collision. I rushed on deck and
found a schooner had run into us and
at our quarter, head on. Our

QUIET SUNDAY
FOR PRESIDENT
He Remains at Home While
Thousands Gather About
the White House Grounds
RECEIVES HIS FRIENDS
Fairbanks Showered With
the Congratulations of His
Admirers at His Church
WASHINGTON, March s.â President
Roosevelt passed the first Sunday after
his inauguration quietly at the White
He-use. Surrounded by the members of
his family and his house guests, he
spent the day in recuperation from the
fatigue incident to the heavy mental
and physical strain which he under
went during the inaugural ceremonies.
It was expected that the President
would attend religious services to-day,
and in anticipation of his leaving the
White House thousands of people
gathered in and about the White House
grounds as early as 9:30 o'clock.
No restrictions were placed on en
trance to the grounds, and throughout
the day thousands of people wandered
about the historic executive mansion.
They swarmed about the main en
trance and peered through the closed
glass doors and windows.
The White House, of course, was
closed to all visitors except the per
sonal friends and relatives of the
Roosevelt family. During the day the
President and Mrs. Roosevelt received
informal calls from many friends and
at both luncheon and dinner large
companies were entertained.
It became evident early in the day
that if the President should leave the
White House to attend services at his
church he would be surrounded both at
the church and in going to and coming
from it by an almost uncontrollable
crowd. He was advised strongly not
I to leave the White House under the
circumstances and finally yielded to
the admonitions of his friends.
Vice President and Mrs. Fairbanks
attended service this morning at their
usual place of worship, the Metropoli
tan Methodist Episcopal Church. At
the conclusion of the service the pas
| tor, the Rev. Dr. Frank M. Bristol, and
a large part of the congregation gath
ered about the Vice President's pew
and extended to him their congTatula
! tions on his induction into his high of
' flee.
While thousands of visitors to the
inaugural ceremonies left the city last
night and early to-day, other thou
i sands remained over Sunday. The day
was fair, but the air was sharp with
frost. Washington" automo
biles and street care were thronged to
, their capacity and the principal thor
â  oughfares of the capital were congest
i ed with humanity throughout the day.
It was remarked by old Washington
! iar.s that this was the first inaugura
; tion period for thirty years when the
! weather had been so uniformly pleas
ant for so many successive days and
comments upon "Roosevelt's luck" and
; "Roosevelt's destiny" became trite in
repetition among the vast crowds
j which thronged the capital.
LJVNDIjORD OF TENEMENT
PITS TAX UPON" BIRTHS
Also Grades Rente According to the
Number of Children In
Each Family.
NEW YORK, March 5. â Thirty
families from the tenement at 6 Goe-
reck street will march to the Essex
street court in a body to-morrow and
demand relief from the exactions from
! Landlord Elias Russ. who is de
nounced by his tenants as the militant
apostle of race suicide.
Russ, it is alleged by his tenants,
I has graded his rents by the number
of children in each family. The main
cause of complaint, however, is that he
taxes each child born in the tenement
at the rate of 50 cents a head. This
appalling: taxation has driven the ten
ants frantic and they will plead for
'â  redress.

In the very Instant I felt and heard some ves

found a schooner had collided with us and nai
head on our quarter, the mlzzen mast gone
two feet above the saddle and the entire
mizzen rigging gone and mast hanging in the

until daylight, when an attempt was made to
save all the rigging and gear, but only suc

wind and Â«ea increased. T&e second mate and
crew on his watch made the following state
ment to me after the collision: The man on
the lookout reported to second mate a bright
light on the weather (port) bow about 2i&
points and he thought at the beginning it was
a steamer's light or a vessel running the came

the other ves*el was so close that a collision
could not be avoided unless the other vessel

been kept on the wind we would have gone

DIVINE TALKS
ON THE IDEALS
Rev. George Stone Tells of
Political Advancement
and Triumph of Freedom
KEFEES TO ANARCHISM
Clergyman Would Bar Sale
of Pocket Arms as Well as
Poison and Intoxicants
Rev. George W. Stone delivered an
interesting sermon at the First Unita
rian Church yesterday morning on
"The Influence of the Ideals." Dr.
Stone noted the advance in political
progression and paid a glowing tribute
to the victory of the RepuWican party.
He said in part:
These thoughts have been suggested to my
mind by the results of the iaat Presidential
election, and the events of the campaign
which preceded it. These are now remote
enough to be regarded without passion or
prejudice. In the course oi events It has
happened that politics has, for once, passed
beyond its accustomed limitations; has risen
above petty personalities; has emerged from
the smoke of industry and commerce; escaped
the noisome vaiwrs of the barroom and brew
ery, to stand under the open heavens, in the
clear light of the twentieth century; to act
upon the momentous question: Can the
President and ruler* of this republic be
chosen by the believers in righteousness and
justlc?? Or to put It another way â U char
acter indespensable in politics? If there are
such belng-s as good angels, who watch over
and report the grxigress of humanity, how they
must have shouted for Joy when they saw
the freemen of thly nation roll up the great
est majority for character, which was the
real issue, as against all other requirements
for leadership. In this the foremost nation of
tht earth. All partisan Issues were over
shadowed by the greater one whether char
acter, fairly earned, can be destroyed at the
behest of a political party. There was no
mistaking the answer to this question.
Whatever prejudices may have existed here
tofore, against reference to politics in the
pvlpit, may. temporarily at least, be dismissed
fw unworthy, for politics, of its own voli
tion, has lifted itself to the level of morals;
has placed Itself under the protection of those
spiritual batteries which alone can defend
and preserve It from confusion and destruc
tion. This progress of politics toward
morals, during the peat two decades, has no
parallel In our history. It will be discerned
when each national election Is compared with
the one that preceded it. But the full effect
was not perceptible until the last election,
when It stood out strong and clear.
The adoption of the Australian ballot law,
as it Is known, by the State of Massachusetts
in 1888. seems to have been the beginning of
this progressive period. Slnre then progress
toward riglit.ousiieps has been sure, but pain
fully Blow. No reasonable person will claim
that perfection has been attained, or even ap
proximated, but every competent observer of
political events will admit that progress has
bef-n made steadily toward political virtue.
On the 6th day of September. 1901, for the
third time In the history of this nation. Its
chief magistrate was stricken down by the
hand of an assassin. This persistent attempt
to Inaugurate government by revolver haÂ» at
last Impressed the nation with a sense of its
responsibility for the lives of those It calls
upon to serve It. I have sometimes thought
iby the way) that the time had arrived for
a law prohibiting the manufacture and sale
of revolver?, or any weapon that could be
concealed about the person. "We attempt to
prohibit the sale of poisons, on the ground
that their use Is dangerous to life; we also
try to stop the jale of liquors. Why not re
volvers? Is it not true that more lives are
lost, destroyed, than are protected and saved
by this murderous device? Think about It.
LABOR AND CAPITAL) FIGHT.
These monstrous crime* of assassination
awoke the nation from Its delusive dream of
Hafety, while a demoralized party spirit was
loose among the masses. The greed for gold,
the lust for power that wealth might be se
cured; the tyranny of party, of capital, of la
bor â the*e were seen In. their true liÃht. and
the pÂ«d|>le rallied to the support of the young
and untried leader, who found himself, unex
pectedly. In the seat of authority. The moral
fiber ef this man soon revealed itself. In every
act, official and personal, the nation soon dis
covered that it had a chief governed by con
science. True, indifference to precedent at
first produced amazement, but chiefly among
those who assumed a monopoly of wisdom in
the profession of politics.
When this feeling of surprtse had passed
away the hypercrittcs became suspicious and
sald, "This man Is catering to the soâ called
good people for support; he Is fishing for pop
ularity." Thus said these men who had spent
their whole lives In this same fishing. Another
class said, "He Is visionary, therefore disap
pointment awaits him; his Ideals are high, but
he can never realize them." The timid said,
"He Is inexperienced and will soon be overcome
by the leaders of his party, and made to do
their bidding; he will soon see 'that no one
man, not even a President, can stand against
the machinations of those who have grown gray
in political service."
It was not long before society was thrown
into confusion by that memorable battle royal,
between Wall .itreet and Wllkesbarre; between
the hosts of labor and the so-called captains
of Industry. The suffering poor, also some
suffering innocents, who were neither poor nor
unwise, asked that this merciless war be
stopped, to the end that they might bo
warmed. Justice cried aloud in the streets,
and no man heard her. Then the President,
although again suspected of self-interest and
hypocrisy, also ambition, used the mighty in
fluence of his office to terminate the contro
versy that was making such mischief among
those who were innocent of any transgression.
By slow degrees, and in many ways, this mas
terful leader established himself in the con
fidence of those who can always govern this
nation when they choose to act together. I
refer to that class which President Lincoln, of
Messed memory, used to delight In calling the
"plain people."
The day of Judgment comes for all admin
istrations. Every administration has an
abundance of friends when it Is new. Happy
the one that has that abundance when its rec
ord Is made up. The McKlnley administra
tion cloetd with honor, with troops of friends,
and the man who finished it was awarded his
Just share of the praise. Mark what followed.
With comparatively little excltem-ent the con
vention of the dominant party met and ratified
the unquestioned choice of Its voters. With
less excitement, less demonstration than usual;
by a larger vote than ever the people, with
small regard for party lines, gave a majority
hitherto unparalleled, for this man who had
b?cn distrusted by party leaders, disliked by
professional politicians, hated by all thieves,
speculators and conspirators against the wel
fare of the naticn.
TRIBUTE TO ROOSEVELT.
You may ask. what is the meaning of all
this, and'why do you find it necessary to refer
to it in a sermon? I answer, because of its
significance. It Is a more perfect illustration
of my subject â the Influence of the ideal â
than can b? foend In the Old Testament or
the new. Here Is a man. iromlnent enough
to be known of all men. He formed a high
ideal in his mind. lons before h? entered the
public service. In all the struggles and en
tanglenfents of hip life, he has kept this ideal
before him: kept it lifted high where he could
Be* It and strive for It. Manifestly he es
teems this ideal of more importance than the
plaudits of men. He trusts it implicitly, and
It has already led him to the summit of
earthly fame and hrnor. It was the influence
of Mb ideal, that lifted him above his fellows.
And now let me suggest what I regard
the highest service Theodore Roosevelt has
rendered the world. It is this. He has In
fluenced the minds of the youth In this nation,
for R'->od. for great good. He has demon
strated that it Is better to love Justice than to
love gold: that character Is Indespensable In
those who seek the highest places In society;
that moral courage is more worthy of ad
miration than bravery on the field of battle.
In the end. this Ideal will replace that cloth?d
in the silt and tinsel of the military and
naval service. Some day It will bring about
the transfer of the soldier to the Police I>
partment. wher<\ in the evolution of national
government he belongs. Henceforth, the ideals
of the brightest and best of the youngr men in
this nation will be influenced favorably by
the career of th* President who was true to
hi? highest ideal, who defied the politicians
and trusted the people.
The events of the past few yean have
brought with them lessons of vast Importance.
We have learned that we live in a world
governed by law; that this law is not sub
ject to accidents; that knowledge grows, and
with It comes a development that reaches not
only the individual but also society as a
whole: that society grows, develops, evolutes
If you will, according to a law as well de
fined and effective as that which governs the
Rweep of a planet or tenderly provides for
the fall of a sparrow. May we not call It
God In hi6tory? Old phrases take on clearer
meanings when Illuminated by the light from
new stars in the firmament of knowledge.
Science unfolds to us a greater God than
Hebrew prophet or apostle knew. We find
tht writing of the Infinite In the havens
above us. The endless work of evolution is
seen on every hand. In crumbling- mountain.

TRAINS CRASH
AT FULL SPEED
Two Persons Killed and Six
Injured in Wreck on North
ern Pacific in Montana
OUDEBS MISUXDEKSTOOD
Engineer of a Freight Euns
Beyond Stopping Point and
Head-On Collision Kesults
MISSOULA, Mont., March 5.â
Two persons were killed and six in
jured as the result of a collision of a
freight train and the westbound Twin
Cities express on the Northern Pacific
at Bearmouth this afternoon.
The express was thirty minutes
behind time and the freight had or
ders to wait at Bearmouth siding. En^
gineer Sheehan of the freight misun
derstood his orders and proceeded
east. As his train rounded the curve
east of Bearmouth it crashed head
on into the express. A high bank
shut off the view of both engineers
and no attempt had been made to
slacken speed. Both trains were
thrown from the track and the mail
and express cars telescoped, but the
passenger coaches came to a dead stop
and remained on the track. The dead:
W. F. WILCOX of Helena, division
chief clerk of the railway mail ser
vice, on tour of inspection, instantly
killed.
J. .L. BILL.HAX of Helena, fireman
of the express, crushed and mangled;
died when removed from the wreck.
The Injured: A. W. Smith of Mis
soula, fireman of freight, scalded and
burned, injuries to chest; may die.
Joseph L. James of Missoula, engineer,
leg broken, left arm bruised, head
cut; serious. Thomas L. Sheehan of
Missoula, engineer of the freight, back
injured; serious. Robert L,. Stew
art of Helena, mail clerk, back and
head injured. Mrs. T. H. Ferrier, El
lensburg. Wash., tourist passenger,
neck twisted and body bruised. Ma
rie Taylor of the "Virginian" theat
rical company, nose broken.
The .dead and injured were brought
to this city on a relief train. The in
jured are being cared for in the
County Hospital.
Royal Priest to Call on the Pope.
ROME, March 5. â Prince Max, a
priest and brother of the King of Sax
ony, has arrived here to present his
homage to the Pope. The Prince de
nies that hlB presence in Rome is in
any way connected with the troubles
between his royal brother and the lat

tunple of religion, leads us forward to greater
triumphs than any recorded In past history.
With all this revelation of the divine power,
in and through which we live and mÂ«ve and
have our being, we may catch inspiring
glimpses of a new ideal for man. The old
Bible, with its light shed from patriarch and
prophet, has thus far served to show us the
path of righteousness. Wisdom has beamed
upon us from Its sacred pages and relielon
has nestled amid its stories, parables and
proverbs. But on. the threshold of this new
century the race looks out upon a greater
bible than the one our fathers knew. This
greater bible is the universe of God. Upon
its sacred pages we may read the record of
his doings. The race has followed Its Ideals;
It has been led from barbarism profound to
a barbarism less profound. Civilization has
dawned, and with the coming years will shine
urÂ«>n us with all Ha glories. The product of
civilization will be shown in the character
of the masses. Prophets the world has always
had: seers, who occupied the heights and
answered the call. "Watchman, what of the
night?" But the true measure of advance
is to be found In the character of the masses.
It is the revelation afforded by .the recent
election, to which reference has been made,
that gives us hope for the future. A new
and higher political Ideal was then recognized
by the masses. This means better legisla
tion, better government. a sterner Justice,
more practical righteousness. The pulpit may
advocate it and Inspire men to study the
problem for themselves, but the work will be
done only when the Ideals of the masses are
lifted to a higher level than that Indicated
by selfish considerations.
The vocabulary In which religion la ex
pressed may change, but religion will still
manifest itself in character. Let us be patient
with mankind. Character Is a growth, not a
creation; it must have time to grow, "first
the blade then the ear. then the full corn In
the ear.""' Let us strive for the ideal set
before us by the master. In the promise which
wp have taken as the text, "Ye therefore
shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father !s
perfect." I

Andrew Carnegie Amused
by Sight of His Name
on the Chadwick Notes
STEEL KING AS WITNESS
Will Appear in Court To- Day
to Be Sworn to Testify
on Behalf of Government
CLEVELAND, 0., March s.â Nathan :
Looser, trustee of the Chadwick assets, i
and County Prosecutor H. R. Keeler
called by appointment upon Andrew '
Carnegie at the home of Sylvester T.
Everett in this city to-day and brought
with them the famous 35,000,000 note
and the equally famous trust agree
ment. The officials obtained specimens
of Carnegie's handwriting for the pur
pose of comparing them with the hajid
writing on the paper which Mrs. Chad
wick used as security for many of her
transactions. Carnegie was amused 'â 
when he saw the documents bearing '
his name. The dissimilarity between |
the signature which Carnegie wrote for ;
Keeler and the signature which was
reputed to be his on the bank paper ,
was marked.
Carnegie asked If he Could be ex- i
cuaed from coming for the second trial
which Mrs. Chadwick and her husband
will have to undergo upon State indict
ments. Carnegie said that he was will
ing to com,e to Cleveland in the inter- I
est of justice as often as necessary; \
that he regarded it as his duty as a i
citizen to do so, and that every citizen
should aid in the punishment of crime
whenever found.
Carnegie said he would be in court
at 9:30 o'clock to-morrow morning to
be sworn as a witness in the Govern
meat case.
Professor Gould of Cleveland, a
handwriting expert, was present dur
ing the conference between Carnegie
and the trustee and Prosecutor Keeler
and made some interesting commant
upon the two styles of writing, as
shown by the alleged forgeries and the
signature of Carnegie.
Carnegie, in the course of his talk
with Prosecutor Keeler and Trustee
Loeser, repeated his former statements
that he had never met Mrs. Chadwick
â had never even heard of her until the
final crash in the woman's financial
affairs came.

TRADE LARGE BUT FEATURELESS.
IT is seldom that trade is so featureless as it was last Keek. From
one end of the country to the other complete tranquillity pre
vailed. Nothing occurred anywhere to attract attention.
At the same time there was a pronounced expansion of general
business, as shown by the gain of 78.5 per cent in the country's bank
clearings, and the vast volume of the clearings themselves, which ran
up to the record-breaking; aggregate pf $3,513,886,000. This is sim
ply huge and gives a very good idea of the large business being done
all over the United States. ( )f the tirst hfty-hvc cities and towns In
the clearing-house list only two â Kansas City and Memphis- ~
showed a decrease from last year, and even these were trivial, that
at Kansas City being only 5.5 per cent and that at Memphis only .4
per cent. The gains, on the contrary, were enormous, that at New
York being 121.3 PerP cr cent, at Pittsburg 44.6 per cent, at Philadelphia
Z2.y pf hicago 15.8 per cent. Boston 31. 1 per cent, and so en.
The failures for the week were 245. against 236 for the correspond
ing week last year.
This great improvement in business is ascribed to much better
weather, which is now springlike The best reports are being re
ceived from the Middle West, where there is a heavy buying demand
for all sons of merchandise. The iron and steel trades are also send
ing in good reports, and one of the very best sign* in this connection
is the voluntary raising of the wages of 30.000 men in the Pennsyl
vania coke district 10 per cent, the general good time? being an
nounced as the reason. This one act alone speaks more for the con
dition of trade than pages of statistics.
Another excellent indication is the persistent demand for stand
ard dividend-paying stocks and good bonds in the New York stock
market, where the daily sales have lately been running up to 1,500,
000 shares, and even over, while the general tone of the market con
tinues buoyant. The demand is chiefly from the general public, as
the plungers and speculators are not conspicuous at present. There
is so much spare money in the country that it must be invested, and
it is finding this outlet.
Money, in fact, is plentiful all over the world. Even the vast
demand? upon it by Russia and Japan to conduct the Oriental war ,
have thus far produced no adverse effect upon the financial market,
and their huge borrowings are effected with practically no difficulty
or hesitation. With funds thus plentiful good times ensue as a mat
ter of course.
The great Staples continue about as previously stated. All are :
in normal demand and at good margins of profit. The crop pros
pects continue excellent.
The Pacific Coast is still sending in fine trade reports. Through- j
out the three States conditions are uniformly brilliant. The weather
thus far this crop year has been ideal : a large area has been seeded
the different grains, while there have been no serious drawbacks
the fruit prospects up to date. With the usual spring showers
and continued immunity from frosts the fruit yield of the coast
sh'iuld be very large this year, and as stocks of the 1904 crop are
practically exhausted the new fruit ought to bring fair prices. The
same conditions prevail in grain. These are great years for the
farmers, and the whole country is reaping the benefits thereof.
As far as San Francisco is concerned the most casual observer
can see at a glance that the city is enjoying an era of pronounced
prosperity. Tall buildings are going up on all sides downtown and
are being filled with tenants as fast as completed. Xevv buildings
are springing up in the residence districts in bewildering numbers.
Ko complaints of any consequence are being heard from the mer
chants, and the recent lull in trade, to which attention was called
several weeks ago. seems to have pa^ed away and to have been
merely a transitory breathing spell. We can safely look forward to
1 times the rest of the year, bearing in mind, of course, that trade. I
like physical health, is never completely immune from sudden and
unexpected maladies, So. although we are still enjoying good time?,
we must not be led into reckless extravagances nor forget that some
time or other we will again feel the pinch of hard times.
SOCIAL UNREST IN RUSSIA.
'yHE fact that the difficulties of the Russian Government are be
coming so serious that an imperial manifesto has just been pub
lished calling upon the country to rally round the throne in de
fense of the empire from its internal enemies, coupled with reports of
the same date indicating that social unrest is still adding its dangers
to the disasters past and imminent from the foreign foes, suggests
that the Czar may yet have tc resort to that method of calling the
country to the support of his throne known as the summoning of the
Zemski Sobor. which it has been rumored he had made decision
iO.
The measures by which the Government attempted to quiet the
discontent in St. Petersburg have, according to the latest reports,
proved a failure : the strike at Moscow has been resumed on a large
. scale : there is trouble in the Caucasus ; there is rioting in Warsaw.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 6. 1905.
AUSTRIAN CROWN PRINCE MASQUERADING
IN THIS COUNTRY.
RUDOLPH OF AUSTRIA AND WOMAN WHO BELIEVES HE IS ALIVE.
SIXTEEN years ago the world was startled by the
official bulletin sent out from Vienna telling of the
suicide of thÂ«Â» Crown Prince Rudolph. To-day there
are scores of his fellow-countrymen in America who
are firm in the belief that that bulletin was a sham
and that their beloved Prince is alive. Many of these
Austro-Americans believe they have seen him in this
country in the last three years.
Here in New York, says the World, live some of the
former subjects of his father. Emperor Francis Joseph,
who think that the Crown Prince is living in America,
a voluntary exile, only awaiting the death of the Emperor
to return and claim the throne. Not a few of these Aus
tro-Americans feel sure they have seen the Crown Prince
right here in New York. Others are equally sure they
have seen him in Boston, Philadelphia and other cities.
The Prince was last seen in Boston ; two weeks ago. â  they
say. At the time of the supposed suicide of the Crown
Prince all but the most meager information was sup
pressed. The official bulletin gazetting his death "rely
said that he had been found dead at th? side of , the dead
body of Marie Vetsera, a woman for whom he had begged
to be allowed to surrender his right to the Austrian
throne. She was said to . have taken poison. According
to the bulletin, the Prince had shot' himself. .
But many Austrians have always believed that for
the purpose of suppressing a court scandal a suicide hoax
was= arranged. ..That done, the Crown Prince disappeared.
Two persons were found in this city, says the World,
who are almost willing: to swear that they have seen the
Prince in this country within the last two yearn. They
are Domir.ik Giuraa and his wife, of No. 602 West Forty
eighth atxeet. At the time of the reported suicide of the
Prince they wore peasants living at Chiunschi. Austria.
Mrp. <Jiuras was fourteen years old, and her husband ten
years her senior.
Prince Rudolph was a popular idol. He traveled
about the country without pomp and was known all over
the empire. Mrs. Giuras recalls seeing the Prince only
a few months hefore his suicide was announced. Her
husband saw him about the same time.
Warsaw's "Social Glass."
The town of Warsaw may be called J
the milk producers' Eden, although ,
the milk consumers' Eden it certainly
is not. There i? probably nowhere j
such a "milk town" as this. Restau
rants are but little frequented. On
the other hand, the public frequents
the various dairies in great numbers '
in order to chat with friends or read
the newspapers, to the accompaniment
of a black or white coffee or a glass of
cold or warm milk. To close a oar- '
gain, or to talk business, th? milk sa
i-reuu un, Arthur, may i ask u.e clergyman to omit the word "obey' uum cmj
marriage service ?
Arthur (thinking of his future wife's large banking account)â Certainly, dear. Just
tell him to make it "love, honor and SUPPLY."- From Judy.
A few years later the peasant girl became the bride
of Giuras. and they came to America to seek their for
tune.
"I am almost certain that it was Prince Rudolph
who came to my home in Newport News, Va., two years
ago." declared Mrs. Giuras.
"He was there three times in as many days. How
well I remember the last evening he came to our house.
I &a\e him a cup of tea, and there must have been some
thing about my manner that led him to believe we sus
pected his identity. I felt certain at the time that I had
the honor of serving tea to the Crown Prince Rudolph,
but of course I could not say so to my strange guest."
Giuras confirmed all his wifÂ»> told him about the
mysterious stranger and added details. He was at that
time employed In the shipbuilding yard at Newport News.
"1 was working one day in the yard," said Giuras.
"when I noticed a new man who was there apparently as
v helper. It was evident that he was not a skilled me
1 h;tni< . in fact it was plain that he was not a man who
was wont to make his living with his hands. Even then
I felt that I had seen him before, but could not recall
where.
"Once I asked the stranger what time it was. He
flushed back the sleeve of his blue flannel shirt and there.
clasped around his wrist, was a wide gold chain in the
middle of which was a small gold watch. The edge of
the case was studded with brilliant stones that must have
been diamonds. It was at my bidding that he came to c
my house.
"The third day at the shipyard I said to the stranger:
'You look so much like the Crown Prince Rudolph of
Austria that I could swear you were he if I did not know
he had been dead these many years.'
"The man stared at me for a moment as if at a loss
for words and then turning away said: 'One can easily
he mistaken in identities."
"He drew his pay that night and after making a
short call at my house he said good-by and we have
never seen him from that day to this. But. like many
of our friends in this country, we believe it was the Crown
Prince."

LOVE'S SIGHT
IS ALL RIGHT
Fewer Mistakes Made by Engaged and Married
People Than Generally Supposed.
DOROTHY FENIMORE
WHY it is that the engaged and
married people of our ac
quaintance have fallen in love
with the particular objects of
their devotion is a question
[ which in our social dialogue has come
to expect no answer. The interroga
| tion mark which indicates the problem
does yeoman service, both as an ex
' clamation point and as a comma, which
permits one to get breath for further
discussion of the subject. Truly, com
pared with this double riddle of hu
i manity, the mystery of the sphinx is
easy reading â especially since the
world has gained a competent inter
preter of the latter in Â«.'o!onel Ram.
"Love is blind," we say sententionsly,
', as we look upon the strange marital
, partnerships that he brings about, but
i in our hearts, meanwhile, we wonder
if, after all, we ourselves are not the
; ones who fail to see. Or else we taka
! one step further into the great un
â  known, by echoing Emerson's reason
', ing: "Love is blind because he does
', not tee what he does not like." And
', this, it is interesting to note, is the at
. titude which that epigrammatic writer
of our own generation. Ellen Thorney
j croft Fowler, takes on 'the matter in
her latest novel, "Kate of Kate Hall."
It is a short-sighted view to take of
the phenomenon in question. Rather,
love sees what it wants to see. While
j the mind of man is prone to classify all
1 people under a few categories, some of
which it accepts and some of which it
rejects as uncongenial, the heart of
I man is a character taster, with a sweet
j tooth for certain delicacies for which
i it is on the lookout with the keen judg
! ment of an epicure.
In his psycho-physical laboratory
â  the scientist has evolved that hard
worked theory of the mutual attraction
of opposite temperaments. He has laid
down with sober pomposity a set of
rules for nfatch-making, which we ad

as respectful a confidence as that we
accord to the recipes in grandma's
i home-made cook book. '
Yet we are really, I think, in the.po
â¢ sition of the little boy of whom we
read a few months ago, who saw the

ANSWERS TO QUERIES
GROUND FOR DIVORCEâ Reader,
City. The grounds for absolute di
vorce in California are: Adultery,
cruelty; desertion, one year; neglect,
one year; habitual drunkenness, one
year; and felony. Parties must have
resided in the State one year before
the commencement of the action.

know of any law that will prevent a
property owner from dredging his land

' desires, unless that by so doing it be
comes a nuisance or a menace to the
public health. In such a case he could
â  be proceeded against.
MUSTANGâ H. B. R.. City. The
origin of the word mustang as ap
plied to the horse is obscure. It is the
I name that has been given to the wild
horse of the pampas and the prairies
!of the Americas. The animal is de
scended from Spanish imported stock,
but has reverted to the feral state. In
dian ponies and small horses used In
the Western States and Territories of
the United States are mustangs or
! descendants of mustangs.
BEN HUR-8., City. The answer
that was published in this department
â¢ some time since relative to E. J. Mor
: gan in the title role of Ben Hur was
: based on information furnished by sev
eral theatrical managers and critics of
this city. A correspondent calls atten-
I tion to the fact that there is in the
1 Broadway Magazine a photograph of
: Morgan in that character and that the
I accompanying article declares that he
played the â  role in the Broadway
Theater, New York. This goes to
prove that managers and critics do not
know It all.
UNIQUE COLONYâ J. 8., City. The
Unique Colony alluded to in the com-
munication is called the Buenos Arai
gos Colony. It was founded in 1853 by
a wealthy Peruvian named Don Jose
Rodriguez. It is located about IDO
which proves all the exceptions.
There are very few people of ordi
nary intelligence who are really com
monplace. The average of individuality
is most amazingly high, considering
the tendency of civilization to cast
mankind In few molds. But. if you are
self-centered, or have not trained your
self to look upon every personality as
unique, you pass over the conspicuous
quality which makes each man dif
ferent from every other man on earth
and you either classify him by some
trait which he possesses in common
with other men or else you look for
tricks nt mind or manner which exem
plify your own experience. Therefore
you are thÂ» blind on*, for you fail to
see the thing which love invariably
sees. Love's insight is finer than rea

CALIFORNIA CLUB IS URGING
THE MEASURE.
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
The training of children to be -worthy
citizens is the first duty of the state:
and in proportion to its neglect of that
duty is a. state deficient in vitality.
Time was In the days of Grecian as
cendency when the child was primarily
the property of the state. Gradually
parental authority grew, and with It
parental responsibility, until the child
came to be regarded as the personal '
property of the parents, to be dealt
with solely by them or their sponsors.
But there has been during the last
<uai ter century a gradual readjustment
of both attitudes.
The oarant who fulfills his duty
toward his child to the best of his
ability in matters of comfort, happi- ;
ness and education is at the same time
fulfilling his obligation to the state. He
is using his best endeavors to produce
a useful citizen, and should therefore
iÂ£Ot be interfered with by the stateâ
the child being his property, naturally,
politically and ethically.
But what of the parent that neglects
bis duty in the essentials that go to up
build the characters of children â
whose homes are the scenes of nightly
orgies, of drunken quarrels, of empty
cupboards, of- filth and utter wretched
ness that abounds in the den of the
drunkard?
These are the parents who have for
feited their right to the stewardship of
their children through personal de
ficiencies. And the state, for its own
protection, must step in and carry out
the contract of rearing these children
to be useful citizens.
So thoroughly is this matter under
stood in older communities that dis
cussion of it bears the appearance of
advocating the obvious.
In these older centers of population
various methods have been tried for
the "'forming*' of these dependent chil
dren charactersâ rather than "re
forming" them later in so-called "re
form" schools. And in all of them has
the parental school, supplemented by
the parental boarding school, been
found to be the most effective agency â
these, of course, considered conjunct
ively with the Juvenile court and the
compulsory education law.
Now, San Francisco has a juvenile
court, a painstaking Judge presiding
over it, vigilant probation officers and
alert truant officers. Likewise has it
a parental school, but it needs â and
needs it badly â a parental boarding
school, where wayward youths may be
placed for specialized training amid
clean, happy, wholesome nome influ
ences. And to this end has the Cali
fornia Club, through its civic section,
been laboring earnestly for many
months, aided and abetted by the
Board of Education and William H.
Langdon, Superintendent of Schools.
That the Board of Supervisors may
be amply informed as to the urgency
of an appropriation for the establish
ment of a parental boarding school
Superintendent LÂ»angdon has filed with
the Board of Education the following
report, which tells concisely the whole
â tory of this modern and progressive
method of making good citizens out of
indifferent or bad material:
The Parental School ha* now b^en in sue
ce**ful operation for eovfn- months. It has
fulfilled our greatest expectations a>- shown
by the superintendent's report, submitted De
Â«ir>r 22. IJK>4, on the Parental School. The
benefit to those actually attending this school
has been but a email pert of the returns to
the city; the fact that such a rchool exists,
and that children may at any time be sent
to it. has a restraining- and subduing influence
perceptibly felt In almost every school of our
city.
The success of this school warrants the
recommendation that a Parental Boarding
School be established in accordance with the
statutes enacted by the California Legislature,
March 24, 1003. Â»nd entitled. "An act to en
force the educational rights of children and
providing penalties for the violation of the
act."
I'arental schools are successfully main
tained in the following cities: Boston, Gosh
en. Lawrence, North Chelmsford. Springfield,
\Voreesttr. in Massachusetts; Buffalo, Brook
lyn, Rochester and Syracuse in Sew York
State: Chicaro. lUs.. and other places.
In a former report (July. l'.Â»<Â»4Â» it was
pointed out that children whose home in
fluences are vicious cannot receive adequate
treatment in a day school. They are In school,
Â«.t most, cix hours a day: eighteen hours a.
<Jsy they are subject to the influences of the
home nn<s the Mroet. Their vicious habits,
natural or acquired, prompt them to seek
the worst influences of the city. These they
carry like moral plague, contaminating all
wholesome children with whom they come
In contact.
The hours out of school educate these in
vice far more than school can educate in vfr
tu*. The only hope for such and for those
whom they might contaminate Is the com
pete separation from their homes and from
haunts of vice.
The la-sr compels the education of our chil
dren and cur ... pay large taxes for the
purpose. Each parent therefore haÂ« a' right
to demand that thÂ» school to which he must
Â»*nd his child be kept free from contagious
disease -â¢her of the body, the mind or the

I have oa tile at present the names of twen
ty-eisht boys who ought to be committed to a
Parental Boarding School. More buildings may
bs added as the school grows. To secure the
land, erect necessary buildings and defray run
ning expenses for the first year, we should
ask the Supervisors to levy a tax as provided
In the statute of about onÂ« cent on the hun
dred dollars, or such other rate as they may
deem sufficient to carry out the recommenda
tions herein contained. â  A detailed account
of what is required will be furnished by your
superintendent when requested. . s
With this statement of facts, which
can be substantiated by aji hour's visit
to the Parental School on Eighth street,
near Harrison, it is certain that the
Supervisorsâ most of whom are think
ing men and anxious to fulfill their
obligations to the peopleâ will see fit to
levy the small tax called for in Mr.
LÂ«angdon's communication.
The years are not distant when wÂ«
can "even up" the tax levy by requir
ing less for Jails and penitentiaries.
And the results will be infinitely more
satisfying to our civic prideâ likewise
to our personal safety.
Prom now until the budget is made
up let every man and woman who
hopes for civic bettermentâ which will
come only through instilling proper
Ideals In the minds of children â urge
upon the Supervisors this vital matter.

Steel Used In Their Construction
Withstands the Ravages of
Time.
CHICAGO, March s.â "Chicago
steel skyscrapers will never decay,"'
declared a leading architect and
building superintendent to-day. "The
theory that our steel buildings will
eventually give way under the strain
of time and rust is not founded upon
known facts."
Continuing, he cited facts devel
oped by the work on an addition be
ing made to the Fair building. The
stee! construction that had been in
place there for eight or ten years
was found to be absolutely free from
rust or other disintegrating influences.
The process of flreprooflng now ac
cepted by builders in this country also
prevents rust. The girders in the
Fair building were found to be in per
fect condition, and the authorities
can see no reason why the next ten or
fifty years would make any difference,
as the steel is protected against all
dampness.

Chicago Nationals Defeat Angels.
LOS ANGELES, March s.â The
Chicago Nationals won from the Los
Angeles ball team to-day In a fast,
snappy game by the score of Z to 2.
There was several sensational plays,
chief among them being the fielding of
line-hit balls by Tinker ar*_ Evers of
Chicago. Goodwin pitched for Los
Angeles and allowed but seven hits.
Had he received as good support as I
Weimer and Wicker did from the Chi
cago fielders he could not have lost.
Attendance, 3000.
RAILROAD HARD
HIT IN NORTH
Washington Legislature
Passes Bill Creating Com
mission With Great Power
KETALIATIOX PROMISED
Corporation Will Enforce
Anti-Pass Provision and
Nullify Favorable Prices
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, March 6.â The most im
portant piece of legislation passed by
he Washington Legislature during the
lession which ends this week has been
:he radical railroad commission bill,
mder which an appointive commission
arm have full authority to regulate
â ates, joint rates, train service and
Hher matters pertaining to the rail
road service. The commission can act
)f its own vdlition without waiting for
.â¢omplaints of shippers.
During three previous biennial ses
sions the Harriman and Hill railroad
nterests have successfully opposed the
'reation of a railroad commission, de
'pite the fact thaUeach State conven
:ion for eight years has pledged both
?c-;itioal parties to the passage of such
i bill. The measure will become a law
n ninety days.
The railroads threaten to make im
mediately effective its anti-pass provi
sion besides withdrawing: discriminat
ng freight rates allowed Spokane. This
ivill hit Eastern Washington, where
:he clamor has been especially loud for
1 regulative railroad commission.

FARMERS EASY VICTIMS
OF A NEEDY YOUNG MAN
Stranjfer Passes Himself Off as a
Deputy Assessor, and Collects
Poll Tax.
WILLOWS, March 5. â Frank Rob
erts, a stranger in this neighborhood,
found himself short of cash a few
days ago. To replenish his depleted
coffers he went out into the high
ways and byways and, representing
himself as a Deputy Assessor, pro
ceeded to collect poll tax from the un
suspecting farmers. He is now in

get a little ready money from the
farmers. He says he is a "remittance"
man and will return the money to
those who fell victims to his "graft."

People to Acquire Homes

BEBUKES THE SHIFTLESS
"Don't Put a $5 Hat on
a 5-Cent Head" Is His
Advice to Colored Men
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW ROCHELLE, N. V., March 5.
'"Eschew cheap jewelry- Quit taking
$i> buggy rides on $6 a week. Don't
but a $5 hat on a -5-cent head." was
the salutation of Booker T. Washing
ton to the colored people who gather
ed in the People's Forum to-day to
Ksien to his lecture on "Successful
Training of the Negro."
Two thousand persons heard Dr.
Washington's lecture and dozens of
times the speaker's voice was hardly
audible, owing to the applause.
Cheer alter cheer went up for the
lecturer and while he was passing
from the theater to his carriage hun
dreds of colored and white men block
ed the passage to shake the hand of
the colored leader who had dined
with the President.
"Get a bank account," continued
Washington during his lecture. "Get
a home of your own. Get some prop
erty. Get a start in the world in some
v/ay. What good Is it to you Northern
negroes that you live in cities with
paved streets if you don't own any
thing? Don't be satisfied with the
shadows of civilization; get some of
the substance for yourselves. Just as
socn as you do you will be recognized
and encouraged, whether you are in
the North or the South."
Judge Alton B. Parker was asked
to preside at the meeting, but declined.
Eleven- Inning Game for Portland.
BAKERSFIELD, March 5. â A team
composed of amateurs who took part
in the Kern County League gave the
Portland Pacific Coast team a hard
tussle to win to-day. Eleven innings
were necessary to decide it. Essick,
St. Vram and Householder were batted
hard. Young Claflin was in the box
for the locals and held down the big
players to five hits. They could not
connect safely one time up to the
eleventh inning. Then the work told
on him and he slowed up. The Port
landfl hit five safeties and the result
was 6 to 2 in favor of the Webfooters.

l SHOOTING ON NEW RANGE
Military Experts Pronotince Grounds
Admirably Adapted <or Rifle Prac
tice at Various Distances.
The new shooting gr-ound in Glen
Park had its first trial yesterday, when
Companies A, D and F of thÂ» First
Regiment, National Guard of Califor
nia, opened fire over the range. The
contour of the park ifc such that the
bullets are sent against the targets,
over the picnic grounds without en
dangering the safety of persons un
less they be in the low lying valley.
Eut this will never be permitted by
Chris Stated, the lessee, who will see to
H that no person is admitted inside
thf valley while shooting is in pro
gress.
The targets are on the east side of
the hill, while the marksmen take their
place.* in the west. The view is good,
and with the young trees lately
planted and growing into timber pro
portions, fogs such as invariably cjoud
the gulch when blown in from the
ocean will be to a certain extent
stopped from blurring the vision of
the men at the breastworks.
The station allotted for the soldiera
is constructed in such a manner as
standing up when firing is done away
with. A breastwork on an incline
pinne, with rests for the rifles, is com
fortably made, so that the men lie on
their stomachs when firing.
Teams to Play Indoor Baseball.
A practice game of indoor baseball
will be played at the Olympic Club
to-morrow evening between a team
selected by John J. Gleason, leader
of the Olympic Club, and a nine
from the Occidental Athletic Club, se
lected by Captain Joe Condon. Fred
Butz and Frank O'Kane will act as
umpires. The line-up of the Olym
pic Club team follows: Catcher,
Charles O'Katir-; pitoher, Goodrich;
first base, William Cartwright; sec
ond base, Al Hampton; shortstop,
Henry Cory; third base, George
James; right field, Adkins;' center
field. A. Pockwitz; left field, Louis
Levy.
No Wind for Model Yacht*.
The Dickie cup race scheduled to
at Sm-eckels Lake yesterday
was postponed until next Sunday on
fcCfCUBt of a lack of wind. A large
crowd gathered to witness the con
test; and the model yachtsmen in
particular were disappointed. The
wind was fluky Â«nri the boat-owners,
after scvÂ»rni smeni;>*R to 'sail under
the tim..? limit of $% minutes, had to
abandon the race.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH 6, 1905.
PICKWICKS AND OAKLAND HORNETS PLAY
AN EXCITING DRAW GAME.
FIRST MATCH FOR ASSOCIATION
FOOTBALL UNION CUP IS FIERCE
MASON SHOOTS
IN GREAT FORM
The opening of Shell Mound Park for
the season yesterday was the most suc
cessful ever held at this popular place
of amusement. The rifle ranges were
crowded with marksmen from morning
until night. Captain L.. Siebe had pre
pared an attractive programme for the
shooters and they took advantage of
the fine day and the steady light to
roll up some excellent scores.
The gardens were crowded with,
merrymakers, some 3000 strong, and
spent an enjoyable day under tht trees
and in the. shady nooks with which the
gardens abound, listening to the con
cert provided for their entertainment
and taking part in the dancing in the
large pavilions.
In the open Shell Mound competition
shoot F. E. Mason and Alfred C. Gehret
did some wonderful shooting. In the
eat-ly part of the afternoon Gehret
scored 95 rings out of a possible 100.
This score stood for some time and the
marksmen who were participating be
lieved it would carry off the honors of
the day. When Frank E. Mason settled
down to hard work with 92 as a starter
and commenced to show the best of
form the excitement on the range be
came intense. When he finally closed
a supreme effort and left the firing box
with 96 rings to his credit he was con
gratulated on all sides by his comrades.
The shooting done by Mason is the best
accomplished in many years. To show
in what good forna he did his work his
nine tickets were 96, 92, 91, 91, 90, 90, 90,
90 and 90. He also carried off the prize
for scoring the most twenty-fives.
Al C. Gehret deserves credit for
the manner in which he rolled up his
good scores. On account of illness it
is the first time the champion has ap
peared on the range in five months. His
six scores were 95, 92, 91, 91, 90, 90.
A pleasing feature of the opening of
the contest was when the centennial
champion, Philo Jacoby, stepped into
the box to start the festival. At the
crack of his rifle the scorer waved the
red flag, showing a center had been
made; thus the successful opening
Bhoot of the year was auspiciously in
augurated. The scores:

SPIRITED SCEKTE DURING ASSO
CIATION FOOTBALL GAME AT
NINTH AND BRYANT STREETS.
The Pickwicks and. the Oakland
Hornets played a tie match in the first
round for the California Association
Football Union Cup yesterday on the
ground at Ninth and Bryant streets.
The ball was kicked off about 3 p.
m., J. Frew being the referee. From
the outset the game was fast and fur
ious, 4ha Pickwicks holding the Hor
nets down well. After several futile
attempts on the part of both teams to
score, James Miller, the Pickwick cen
ter forward, put the Ball between the
posts. Shortly afterward the Hor
nets equalized the score. At half
time the score stood: Pickwicks, one
goal; Oakland Hornets, one goal.
In the second period both teams
played a hard game, the referee
awarding several fouls against the
Hornets. Neither side was able to
score and the match ended in a draw.
The Oakland Hornets were weakened
by the absence of Barrett, goalkeeper;
Gillchrest, full back, and R. Taylor,
half back. Some of the spectators
displayed too great an anxiety for the
Pickwicks to win and made unneces
sary comments on the play of some
members of the Hornet team.
For the Pickwicks Krauskopf ren
dered valuable service in goal and the
two backs were generally on the spot.
The teams lined up in the following
order:
Pickwicks. Positions. Oakl'd Hornets.
Krauskopf Goalkeeper. . . . W. McGregor

as they want to be in the beat of form
by next Sunday when the great bene
fit game will be held. Already the
sale of seats has exceeded that of last
year by nearly 5000, so a record
breaking throng is sure to be present.

BAKER LEADS
OUT GABRIEL
The balmy weather attracted many
spectators to the Golden Gate Park
tennis courts yesterday to witness the
semi-finals and finals of the handicap
singles tournament. George Baker and
Harold Gabriel were successful in the
semiTflnal matches and came together
in the final late in the afternoon. Two
sets were played, both of which went to
Baker. The latter allowed odds of owe
15 3-6. The match was started too late
in the afternoon to be completed.
Baker had a hard match in the morn
ing and was rather tired when the
final match was started. He freshened
up later and managed to pull out the
first set from a lead of 6-1. Gabriel
started with a rush and played a re
markably good game for such a young
ster. He drove and chopped past his
opponent continually. He soon ran the
score ud to 5-1 in his favor and he
hardly looked to have a chance to
lose the set from the way he was play
ing. Baker fought hard and was as
steady as a clock. He stuck gamely
to his task and time and again won the
point which would have given his op
ponent the set. Gabriel led at 5-3 and
40-15 and at 5-4 and 40-36, but could
not get the point which meant the set
to him. He again led at 6-5, but Baker
won the next three games and set..
Gabriel was discouraged after losing
the first set and fell down in the sec
ond. On the other hand, Baker played
better as the match progressed. This
set went to Baker rather easily, the
score being 6-5. The match will be fin
ished next Sunday.
In the semi-finals Baker had an ex
ceedingly hard match with L. Howell.
The latter had a handicap of owe 15 3-6
and 3-6 and made good use of it. He
won the first set, 6-4, and came danger
ously close tq winning both the second
and third sets. These went to Baker
by scores of 8-6 and 9-7.
The other semi-final match resulted
in an easy victory for Gabriel. He re
ceived the small handicap of owe 3-6
from A. H. Brabant.
Gabriel, who is only 15 years of age,
played a remarkable game throughout
the day. His lack of experience un
doubtedly counted against him in his
match with Baker, who is a veteran
and an exceedingly hard man to beat.
The following matches were played
for the indoor singles tournament on
the park courts:
Preliminary round â G. Baker beat C. Skaggs
by default; Major Van Vll-t beat K. C. Noble.
6-2. 7-5; Gayness beat Getx by default; Mc-
Ixmghlin beat Haynes, 0-2, 7-6; Schmidt beat
FlnkeriStedt by default; Brabant b*at H. Long,
0-1. b-4; Lemon beat Lowe by default; Drolla
b?at Captain Jewell. 3-ti, 0-4. C-3; M. Long
beat Powell by default; Foley beat Miller
Hotchklsa by default: Sobey beat Hall by de
fault.
First round â Gabriel beat N. Baker by de
fault; Van Vliet beat GayiKÃs, ti-2. 7-5; Urolla
beat Lemon, 6-2, 2-6. 6-3; Griffin beat Fin
n-g:an, 6-2. 6-3.
The California Club courts were well
patronized yesterday. In the morn
ing the Hotchkiss brothers. Marius
and Miller, defeated Fred Adams and
Guy Lytton in the preliminary round
for the indoor tournament. All four
players are from the park. The Hotch
kiss brothers were much steadier than
their opponents and won mostly on the
j latters' errors. Adams played a good
game for the losers. Lytton was a
! trifle wild and fell down at critical
j times. The score was 6-4, 0-6. 6-4.
One match was played in the contin
uous tournament. The contestants
were Paul Jones, the only man in the
! second class, and W. G. Knowlton.
i who is number one in the third class.
j The latter haÃ come up from near the
I bottom of the fourth class and had only
j suffered defeat once. This was at the
hands of Dr. Lovegrove, who lately
j Buccumbed to the "iron man." Knowl
: ton did his beÃt yesterday to break
I into the second class, but Jones was a
' trifle too strong for him. Knowlton
fought desperately all the way and
Jones' best efforts were reauired to
win. The score was 10-8, 7-5.
Some good practice games were play
ed on the club courts. The best was
a singles between George Busch and
Grant Smith. The latter played a
strong game and won in straight seta.
Busch played a good game, but his op
ponent was too fast for him at the net
The score was 7-6. 6-4.
Harry Rolfe and Herbert Schmidt
played three fast sets. Rolfe is In
splendid form at present and won two
sets out of three. The score was 4-6.
7-6. 6-4.
Grlng and Chesebrough won two sets
out of three from Kenyon and Jones.
The score was 6-4, S-6, 6-4.
REDS OUTPLAY WHITES
IN A BRILLIANT CONTEST
Exciting Work With Ball and
With Mallet.
The Reds outclassed the Whites 2 to
1 in the polo match yesterday, the final
score being 10 goals to 5 in their favor.
The victors were Paul Clagstone, Sir
George Prescott, Walter S. Hobart and
Captain C. de Crespigny, with F. C. O.
Menzies as a substitute for Prescott In
the last two periods. The Whites were
Francis J. Carolan, F. J. Mackey, C. R.
Tobin and John Lawson. R. M. Tobin
acted as referee and Charles W. Clark
as timekeeper.
The game was played at Crosaways
farm, Burlingame, and the private
clubhouse of F. J. Carolan was filled
with an attractive array of fashionable
femininity and their escorts, while sev
eral hundred people of the countryside
lined the fields on all sides.. The large
crowd, the frequent applause, the
weather and field conditions at their
best combined to insure a fast and a
good game with many sensational
plays, and the peerless sport was never
indulged In to better advantage. The
prominent goalmakers were Hobart for
the Reds, 5 goals, and Lawson for the
Whites, 3 goals. Paul Clagstone and
Cyril Tobin secured 2 each, while Pres
cott, De Crespigny and Menaies each
scored 1.
Hobart led off with a goal for his
side, quickly followed by Lawson, who
evened up the score with one, but this
was again broken by Hobart before the
RECTOR SHOWS
FORMER SPEED
Rector, a greyhound which has been
a consistent performer on California
coursing fields for nearly five years,
won the class stake yesterday at Union
Park from Richard Anton. The latter
showed a length of speed in the run
up the field. Rector scored one turn
and the kill and then carried off the
long end of the purse.
Raby Aurora, Race King and Rocker
Arm, three greyhounds from the ken
nels of James Sweeney, divided the
reserve stake. There was but one hare
left with which to run three trials, so
the Sweeney dogs were not reauired to
meet one another, the lone hare being
used in the deciding course of the class
event.
The hares afforded poor trials
throughout the day and kept the bet
ting men busy figuring on the prob
able winners. One of the most de
cided upsets was the defeat of the 1
to 4 choice Carlow Boy by the Eastern
dog Patched Up. Race King defeated
both Sherman and Renegade Apache at
the same odds. Royal Spirit won from
In Time at 6 to 1.
Mickey Free was beaten by Frisco
Lad in the first round of the reserve
stake. This is the first time he ever
lost in the initial round of a stake.

period ended. Sir George Prescott
â cored early in the second period for
the Reds and Cyril Tobin for the
Whites doing the trick in about 30 sec
onds. He secured the ball at an oppor
tune moment and outracing all Â»he
others across the field placed it between
the posts without a false stroke.
In the third period Hobart scored
twice and Lawson once, so tha period
closed 5 to 3 In favor of the Red*. Early
In the fourth De Crespigny made one
of his phenomenal backhanded strokes,
with which he goaled the ball at about
forty yards at a difficult angle, winning
great applause.
Lawson scored again and thÂ«n som*
rough riding was done that brought
fresh lanrels to Hobart. He had start
ed the ball down the field, when Cyril
Tobin, tn riding him off. forced him off
the field into the paddork. They gal
loped through a "scramblfng crowd,
thundering past th<* dubhouse>, while
the elite of fashion dodged out of d&n
1 ger, then back to the field, where Ho
bart escaped his nemesis, found the ball
and drove it between the goal posts,
although there were many ponies be
tween him and the goal. Clagstone and
Menzies scored for the Reds in the fifth
and Clagstone again in the sixth, which
) after one more by Tobin for the Whites
concluded the match. The great inter
' national match between HurMngharn
and Hurlingame will be played next
Sunday.
FIRST HONORS
FOR FOXHUNTER
J. Doyle's greyhound Foxhunter
took first honors in the class stakÂ«
at Ingleside Park yesterday, defeating
in succession Marvis Clair, Free Born,
Lucy Clair and The Duke. In the de
ciding course The Duke was figured
on to capture first place, but the black
dog showed the class and won an
easy victory.
Foxhunter surprised the wise ones
by leading and defeating Lucy Claip
in the third round. Lucy Clair was
looked upon a." a -mre stake winner,
and her defeat by Foxhunter was <*
hard blow to the talent, as they mafh
her a pronounivd favorite. They
were slipped to a poor hare, which
was killed before the dogs had a
chance to extend themselves.
The hares were weak and afforded
poor trials tOroughout the day. Few
succeeded in taking the greyho .
half-way across the field. Butte City
won the class stake by beating Pre
sidio Girl tn the final. The former
dog had easy trials and had no trou
ble in winning the deciding course.

SHOOTS BULLET
THROUGH HEART
Captain A. W. Holstrom
Oommftti Suicide in Cabin
of the Schooner Fortimu
Captain A. W. Holstrom of the
schooner Fortuna, which is lying in
the stream off Meiggs wharf, com
mitted suicide in his cabin carlv yes
terday morning by shooting himself
through the heart. The body was
taken to the Morgue. Despondency
due to excessive drinking is supposed
to have led him to end his life.
Between five and six o'clock yester
day morning Holstrom came out of
his cabin and walked queerlv back
ward and forward near the stern. He
pulled a revolver out of his Docket and
fired a shot in the air, returning to his
cabin. He ordered J. F. Miller, the
steward, to make him some coffee.
The steward took a cup of coffee to
him and a few minutes later he and
Peter Johnson, the mate, heard a shot.
They ran to the cabin and found the
captain on top of his bunk with a bul
let hole over his heart. He died al- '
most immediately.
The vessel is owned by Woodside.
Ferem & Co., and one of the
partners. John Ferem. called at the
Morgue yesterday. He said that Hol
strom had been a close friend of CaD
tain Heinrlch Toffer of the schooner
Marion, who committed suicide in a
similar manner last week. Ferem saw
Holstrom on Saturday and Holstrom
said to him that he wished he was with
Toffer, as there was no use for a man
living who could not stop drinking to
excess. Ferem tried to cheer him ud.
telling him he was good for forty years
yet.
Holstrom was about 42 years of ajre
and unmarried. Mrs. Anderson, who
lives in San Pedro, is Holstrom's
sister. The owners said they would
notify her of the suicide of her brother.
Holstrom Joined the Masonic body at
Port Gamble, Wash., last year.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, MARCH <V 1905.
ZIMMERMAN, THE ACTING
WAGNER IS DELIGHTFUL
Is Great Orpheum Favorite
Kolb and Dill Charm
Big Crowd at
the Grand.
â¢Willy Zimmerman has been hazily
announced as something new in the
impersonating line. Mr. Zimmerman's
heralding was distinctly modest. The
only way one knew that it was not
Richard Wagner conducting from the
Orpheum stage last night was because
the actor's cap stuck to his head dur
ing the Orpheum "Tannhauser." Nor
was the Wagner any better than Mr.
Zimmerman's Oscar Hammerstein â
sampling one of his own cigars, bricks,
and the evening paper while he con
ducts one of his own "works." Com
posers are the actor's specialty. He
gets them at the conductor's desk and
for the moment the man is before you.
Liz^t, absorbed, aristocratic, fastidi
ous; Verdi, genial, kindly, laying aside
the bator to conduct with his hand;
Yon Suppe, important, electric,
sprawling enthusiastically over his
deskâ you get the very man, face, fig
ure, gait-and very voice. It is acting
of the best, brilliantly humorous, and
as portraiture not any worse than, say,
Mr. Mansfield's Beau Brummel. The
audience gave every token of keen en
jeyment. '
Mabel McKinley is another star of
the iirogramme. It is some time ago
since Miss McKinley first came hereâ
as was said then, on her name. She
now comes here on her merits. The
singer's vaudeville experience has not
improved her. She oversings, overacts,
overdoes throughout. She sings â¢Vio
lets" as though it were "La Tosca."
She sings her own little uncharac
teristic Japanese song, "Karama" with
the weight of an "Erl King." And
Miss McKinley has acquired a collec
tion of strenuous facial gestures to
match. But her voice has gained in
volume and is unquestionably a good
one, sweet, full and wide in range. She
was encored for the "Karama" song
and gave her own catchy "Anona," re
peating again one of the verses.
In the Peschkoff company of Rus
sian dancers the bill has a fascinating
novelty. JY>ur extremely handsome
young women and a male rossack form
the troupe, that presents characteristic
Russian national dances. They are
garbed and bejeweled in gayest fash
ion, and the dancing is always pic
turesque and frequently graceful. The
feminine Russian shriek â that, like
that of the Madcaps, punctuated the
dancing â seems much like any other,
and vastly amused the audier.-ce. The
Mallory Brothers, Brooks and Halliday
are also new, and colored, and among
them give a stunning "Alexander." The
rest of their performance, on various
instruments of torture of brass and
strings, does not seem vitally neces
sary. Then, if one cares for marion
ettes you will find none better than
Paul Powell's; and Piwltt, "the mys
terious face," continues to mystify.
Most of the turns are good reasons for
seeing the Orpheum's bill this week.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
Kolb and Dills tremendous local
popularity served to pack the Grand
Opera House last night, and the enter
tainment presented by them and thoir
aides presaged numerous repetitions
of the packing. Never in their career
did the funniest German comedy duo
on earth receive a more splendid re
ception than was extended when they
bounded into view in their first scene,
and it is doubtful whether the big
Mission-street theater ever resounded
with cheers so spontaneous, so deaf
ening and so prolonged. The enthusi
asm continued at least five minutes,
and was only stopped by Mr. Kolb
stammering his appreciation of the
tribute, Mr. Dill, of course, being com
pelled to follow suit.
Since their acquisition of "I. O. U.,"
originally produced about a year ago
at Fischer's Theater, Kolb and Dill
have had the book and music revised
iv a way that has vastly improved
both, and in the production of the
new edition they have been lavish of
expenditure. TheirÂ»own work is more
side-splitting than ever, and their sup
porting principals are adequate, the
chorus is numerically and vocally
strong and the costuming luxurious.
Maude Alice Kelly, the leading wom
an, is statuesque, acts well and sings
expressively with a soprano of limited
compass. The leading man, Cfraude
Hunt, is remindful of Winfleld Blake
in the same role, and the soubrette,
Lillie Sutherland, is destined to share
glory with her conmedian managers.
She is the most thoroughly soubret
tish soubrette that ever appeared in
conjunction with Kolb and Dill in San
Francisco. Will H. Cross played the
walking delegate well enough to prove
himself a clever character actor. And
the versatile Ben Dillon, who received
a welcome hardly less enthusiastic
than that given Kolb and Dill, dis
pelled whatever question may have
existed aa to the capability of any
other than a Hebrew impersonator
working effectively with the Teutonic
team. His quaint Hibernian method
was just as strengthening a foil to
them as was that of any of his gid
dish predecessors In the part.
Two numbers that "went big" were
a song-and-dance sextet in the second
act and a Maori novelty in the third.
The latter was a gorgeous stage
picture, and the vocal and orchestral
effects were both original and fetch
ing.
"I. O. U." is assured of a successful
inning.

Eesidence on Sixth Avenue
COVEKED WITH PISTOL
Description Tallies With
Desperado Kecently Oper
ating in Western Addition
J. Rothchild, 1256 Sixth avenue. Sun
set district, telephoned to the Golden
Gate Park police station late Satur- J
day night that he had been held ud !
by a lone footpad and $12 taken from j
him. Lieutenant Anderson sent Cor
poral Ferguson and Policeman Toroey !
to get the details from Rothchild. |
Policeman Dean searched the neieh- i
borhood. *1
Rothchild said he got off a car at
Sixth avenue and H street shortly [
after 11 o'clock. He had walked about
half a block along Sixth avenue when-:
a man stepped up to him and. Doint-
ing a revolver at his head, ordered
him to throw up his hands. Rothchild
quickly complied and the foot Dad
coolly went through his. pockets, tak- '
ing the $12, all the money he had.
"Now walk along and don't make a
noise or I'll blow your head off." said
the footpad, still keeping Rothchild
covered. Rothchild obeyed instruc
tions, but as soon as he reached his
home he called up the police station
by telerjione.
From the description of the foot Dad !
given by Rothchild the police think j
he is the same man who has been
operating along Oak and Page streets. '
He is described as about 25 years of
age, five feet six inches tall, dark com- I
plexion and wore a dark suit and |
slouch hat. From his coolness and
actions Rothchild is satisfied that he
is an old hand at the business.
The police made a thorough search of
the saloons in the neighborhood, but
could find no man answering the de
scription and no one had apparently
seen him.
FORMER MACHINIST. NOW A
MINISTER, SPEAKS TO MEN
Rev. Charles Stolzle Addresses larse
Assemblage on "Jesus Christ and
the Workingman."
A large audience of men listened to |
an address by the Rev. Charles Stelzle
at the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion yesterday. The subject was l
"Jesus Christ and the Workingman."
Mr. Stelzle is a member of the Inter- ;
national Asssociation of Machinists
and for eight years was a machinist
In New York. From the shops he
went into the ministry and now rep
resents the Board of Home Missions of
the Presbyterian church in the inter
ests of workingmen. On the platform
were the Rev. William Kirk Guthrie,
th( Rev. J. S. Thomas and General
Secretary McCoy of the Young Men's
Christian Association.
The Rev. Mr. Stelzle in the coursa
of his address said.
Jesus ChrUt did not care to elaborate a Â»yÂ§- !
tern of theology, but to introduce himself to â¢
men's hearts and minds. The question you j
and I must answer Is not what do you think
of this doctrine or that principle or that :
church, but what think ye or Christ?
I asked this question of 2CO of the most ;
prominent labor leaders In this country. After
all repetitions and all superfluous matter had j
been eliminated the answers resolved them- ]
selves into the following statements: First. ,
Jesus Christ was a social reformer, he was a I
â rood man, but not divine; Jesus is a great i
teacher, but cimply one of many teachers; he
was the world's redeemer.
Mr. Rtelzle took up each of these
answers, showing the supremacy of
Jtsus Christ and his influence in the
social and political life of to-day as
well as his power in the lives of indi
vidual men.
Next Sunday afternoon the Rev. Mr.
Stelzle will speak at the Young Men's
Christian Association especially to
workingmen on the question, "Does
the Church Help the Labor Move
ment?"
Robbed by His Hedfeilow.
The next time Harry Atkinson ac
cepts the invitation of a strange man
to share a portion of his bed he will
be more careful as to his host. On
Saturday night Atkinson accepted the
invitation of a man, whose name he
does not know, to sleep with' him in a
looming-houee on Fourth street, near
Mission. When Atkinson woke up. the
kind man had disappeared and with
hit; disappearance $20 also took flight,
ali the money Atkinson had when he
vent to sleep. The police were noti
fied and expect to be able to find his
missing bedfellow.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN ENDS
LIFE IN TRAGIC MANNER
Deliberately Throws Himself in Front
of an Electric Car at Fifth
and Clara Streets.
An unidentified man committed sui
cide early yesterday morning by
throwing himself in front of an elec
tric car at Fifth and Clara streets.
The car was in charge of Motorman
Charles Anderson and Conductor J. J.
Sherrin and was soutbound.
Anderson saw the man crossing the
street, shortly before 7 o'clock, and
standing close to the rails, till, as he
thought, the car would pass. Then
tht- car bumped into something and
Arderson quickly pulled up. The man
was dragged out from under the
wheels. Life had been crushed out of
him, the body being terribly mangled.
It was taken to the Morgue.
A. E. Hoffman. 908 Harrison street,
and other eye-witnesses told Police
man P. Murphy that they saw the man
deliberately throw himself in front of
the car. Murphy placed Anderson un
der arrest and booked him at the City
Prison on a charge of manslaughter.
He was released on $50 cash bail.
The body is that of a man about
45 years of age. .There was nothing in
the pockets of the clothing that would
lead to his identification and no coin.
Judging from the clothing the man
was in poor circumstances.

Small Fire in Natoma- Street House
Discloses Trouble Over an
Increase of Rent.
A small fire early this morning in
the home of George Braun at 4 SO 1 -!
Natoma street caused $50 loss. Its
origin is surrounded with mystery.
Braun is the owner of this and ad
joining houses and recently raised the
rent of 540, occupied by William
Smith. He declares that Smith said
he would "get even with Braun" for
this increase in rent.
Whether this alleged threat has any
connection with the origin of the fire
is doubtful. The Fire Department
men, who quickly got the flames un
der control this morning, are positive
that the blaze was caused by care
lessness in the use of matches in
Braun's own family and that it could
not have been started from outside
the house. The fire begun in a closet
that was not within reach of any per
son outside the family, had there been
any one who desired to set fire to the
place. Â«.
