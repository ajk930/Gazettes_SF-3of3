JORDAN ADMITS HE BRIBED SENATORS
â . , ,, â _
JORDAN, the man who was said to have acted as the agent of building and loan corporations and purchased immunity from
investigation at the hands of the Legislature from four members of the Senate, confessed last night that he had handled the bribery
money, and as such agent paid over to Senators French, Emmons, Wright and Bunkers, members of the committee appointed to investigate
certain corporations,s3so each. He verified in every detail the statements of the detectives employed by the corporations The confession was
obtained only after counsel for the accused Senators had made every effort to keep Jordan off the stand.

RAM EN rp, Feb. 8. â Joseph S. Jordan has confessed and the doors of the peniten

- cannot dispel theii terror of the fate they see ahead.
nfession of Jordan astounded a majority of the great audience that jammed the Sen
iiamber to suffocation. Character witnesses had been telling that Detectives Tichenor and
Hartling. who first pointed the linger of accusation at the alleged boodlers were men of good
racter and known veracity and integrity.
EMMONS UNABLE TO STAND THE STRAIN.
The audience saw a dull session ahead when it was announced that Senator Emmons would
kI. to be followed by the rest of the accused, to nail under oath the sworn charges
them a- rankest perjury. Once under oath the accused would have been absolved from pros
ition for bribery under provisions of the law framed to induce men to confess when guilty of
i! ways proved with difficulty. Bui they were to be denied this privilege. Dis
id 'Attorney Seymour ro^e and demanded that the committee do not thus sacrifice the rights of
; tate: that the fate of the accused be reserved for the decision of courts that alone could mete
out to them just punishment for their crimes.
jiit. and a tremendous burst of applause marked the temper of the audience.
Emmons, who had hastened to the witness chair when his name was first called, sat for a moment in
bewilderment mopping his forehead with a handkerchief, and then rose and made his way out of
the chamber, accompanied by his wife, who hastened here to aid him when he first stood accused of
"he sympathy of the entire audience was hers, but what little there was for her husband
ted from her. Bunkers sat. his face aflame with excitement; the features of Wright were
ashen ; French was sullen in the face of the adverse turn the case had taken.
JORDAN DISPELS THEIR LAST HOPE.
And then .came Joseph S. Jordan to the stand. With a clear voice he tore .aside the last
remnant of defense that remained for the accused and they stood exposed beyond possibility of
(icten-c. Jordan told in every detail as to the manner in which he received the gold that bought
race lor Bunkers, Emmons, French and Wright from the hands of the detective set to trap
them. He told how he paid the Senators the sums they demanded to carry out their dishon
orable compact to protect the men that parted with the price of their dishonor, but he varied in
one important particular from the testimony introduced by the prosecution.
Clarence Grange, manager of the Phoenix Building and Loan Association, who raised the
purse with which the boodlers were trapped, testified that Jordan first came to him and told him
that the Committee on Commissions and Retrenchment was organized and open for business
and it was then he conceived the idea of ending the public careers of the men that sought to
blackmail him. With other building and loan men he proceeded, he testified, to place the mat
ter in the hands of Gavin McNah. attorney for the Continental, and success waited on their efforts.
SAYS GRANGE SUGGESTED BRIBERY.
Jordan testified to-night that it was not he but Grange that first rnised the question as to
whether the committee could l>e bought, and that it was in obedience to Grange's instructions that
he went to Â«^ee the men he picked out of the committee as corruptible and entered into the compact
. >r a stated sum they would protect the Phoenix. Renters and Pacific States companies, the Pa
lates refusing later to enterthe scheme of entrapment. It was also, he said, at Grange's sug
l that he inquired of the now -convicted Senators how much it would cost to protect the Con
inental. and that in answer the boodlers told him they could not do it for less than $10,000 â that
too hard a fight wa* being directed against the institution.
There is no question but Jordan has escaped the consequences of his acts as a lobbyist and
briber of legislators, but whether he will escape prosecution for perjury yet remains to be deter
mined. Mr. Grange is not in a temper to be trifled with and Jordan has cast the lie fairly and
xjuareh at him. But it is thought that Jordan's disgrace is sufficient punishment for him and
that Grange will be willing to let the question of veracity between him and Jordan rest for final
ston with the great jury of public opinion.
District Attorney Seymour said to-night that no arrests would be made before to-morrow,
when the Grand Jury would resume its investigation of the bribery cases. It is presumed that that
body will at once return indictments against the four accused Senators, or against Bunkers and
EmmpÃfi, anyway.
When the hearing was finished to-night many spectators thronged the corridor outside the
Senate chamber, expecting that some of the accused men would be taken into custody at that time,
but no arrest was made.
The four Senators are closely watched by detectives, so that none of them will be able to
escape from Sacramento.

SACRAMENTO. Feb. B.â After an
hour's weary work examining witnesses
that testified to the good character of
Detectives Tichenor and Hartling, the
great climax of the bribery scandal was
reached to-night. The prosecution had
announced that it had exhausted its
list of the character witnesses, but that
more would probably be in on the late
train. Then the defense announced that
it would go on with its case. Attorney
Cator said he would call Senator Em
mons to the stand, and later the rest ot
the accused, that they might disprove
the grave charges against them. Then
the sensation came. District Attorney
Seymour of Sacramento, who had not
appeared before to take part In the
proceedings, took a place near the
desks of the committee and said:
SEYMOUR OBJECTS,
"I object to the effort here to swear
j these accused Senators. I do not care
what may be my opinion of the merits
of the charges that have been lodged
here, it is apparent to every man that
a grave offense against the laws of the
State has been committed and that
crimes denounced by the penal statutes
were consummated."
Cator leaped to his feet before Sey
mour could proceed further and said:
"I have the highest respect for the
District Attorney of this county, and
agree that if he wishes to address him
self to the legal status of this case he
has the right, but I say that it is highly
improper that he should in any man
ner express an opinion or refer to the
evidence in the case. If he is ready to
present any reason why this case
should not proceed let him do so. I
cannot believe from past statements
that he has made that he would do
anything to prejudice the interests of
the accused. No one supposes that
these men are going to ran away."
Senator Simpson of the committee

here entered the controversy and
moved that Seymour be given the right
to proceed. The motion carried and the
District Attorney continued:
"If Mr. Cator will listen as patiently
to me as I did to him I will soon show
this committee why these men should
not be sworn. I will say. if Mr. Cator
objects to my remarks heretofore made,
that there is reasonable cause to be
lieve that a srrave offense has been
committed by two at least of the ac- j
cused men. and they should be placed
on trial in the criminal courts for their
acts.
"What would be the legal effect if
they are sworn here?
CITES THE CODE,
"Section 304 of the Political Code, |
bearing directly on this case, will free
these men from any prosecution what
ever if they are sworn here. This sec
tion reads as follows:
" 'No person sworn and examined bo
fore either house of the Legislature or
any committee thereof can be held to
answer criminally or be subject to any
penalty for forfeiture for any fact or
act touching which he is required to
testify; nor is any statement made or
any paper produced by any such wit
ness competent evidence in any crimi
nal proceeding against such witness;
nor can such witness refuse to testify
to any fact or to produce any paper
touching which he is examined, for the
reason that his testimony or the pro
duction of such paper may tend to dis
grace him or render him infamous.

Senator Simpson again interrupted
the District Attorney and asked him
if he knew of any rule under which
the committee could refeuse to swear
the accused. Seymour answered as
follows: â¢
"No, I do not. These proceedings
arc unusual, and I doubt that such a
rule can be found, but public interest
demands that you grant my request
and refuse to swear these witnesses.
My duty is plain and the courts should
be giwn th<^ right to determine the
merits of this case. If they are guilty
they should be punished for their acts
anil disqualified to hold office of public
trust forever.
"What punishment can you mete out
to th^m? All y<ui can da is to expel
them from the Senate and can you do
that? I'nder the law it takes a tno
thirds vote to expel a member from
either house and in this instance they
have four votes themselves. Then they
would have to rally but ten friends
around them and they would be safe
from all your efforts. If you swear
these men they will be absolved from
prosecution, and can never be held to
answer criminally for this offense or
any offense upon which they are called
to testify.
"I ask you in all earnestness that
you do not swear them. Are you go
ing to tie the hands of the authorities
of this State, the representatives of the
people and defeat the ends of justice?"
SUGGESTS A RE3IEDY.
"What do you suggest, then?" asked
Simpson.

"I suggest that if these men want to
do so tftat they make statements be

oath. The eyes of the whole people are
upon you. You can not afford, as I
have said, to absolve these men fron*
the consequences of their acts and that
is what you .will do if you swear th<^B
here and permit them to testify. I con
ceive what is my duty, but if you pre
vent me the responsibility rests on you,
not on me."
When Seymour concluded his address
the decorum of the hearing was broken
for the first time. The audience joined
tn tremendous applause and the rap

lence was restored and Cator. astonish

th<? stand and swear they had nothing

Kvcn should these statements on their
part be later proved false they would
not escape. The law plainly provides
that in any event they can be prose
cuted for perjury, and the evidence in
such a case would be the same as that
in proceedings against them for bri
bery. These men have come here and
accused these Senators to further their
own selfish ends and I insist that the
accused rfiall have the full protection
of ihe .aw."
A certain element in the rear of the
hall broke into applause at this lasjt
remark and Chairman Belshaw said:
"If any further demonstration takes
pluce here to-night the committee will
order ihe chamber cleared of every on*
not directly interested. Decorum must
be maintained."
His threat had the desired effect and
during the rest of the session the audi
ence sat â  silent witness to the dra
matic scene.
"If you refuse to place the accused
on the stand to make statements on
their own behalf, under oath, this com
mittee wil! refuse to proceed with the
examination, but will n port the ques
tion that has arisen to the entire Sen
ate and ask instructions," said Simp
son.
Again Cator refused to permit any of
his clients to take the stand and the
committee voted to refer the question
to the Senate. The audience thought
the end of the evening's session had
come, but McXab got up. walked over
to District Attorney Seymour, and then,
addressing the committee, said:
M.NAIS TAKES I LOOR.
Â« c are *iot Here as prosecutors. We
presented certain facts in an affidavit
and the committee then ordered us to
present our proofs. The District At
torney has just informed me that Mr.
Jordan is willing to testify. Mr. Jor
dan has been charged by the District
Attorney â with certain crimes as the
recognized agent of the accused Sena
tors. While we do not ask it, we do
not object to Mr. Jordan taking the
stand if the District Attorney is will
ing."
Attorney Charles Jones, who, in the
absence of Attorney Hirman Johnson,
represents Jordan, asked to be heard
at this point. He said:
"I appear for Mr. Jordan and I
wish to say that Mr. Jordan has been
instructed that if called upon by this
committee to testify that he must do
co under the law. 1 have advised him
to tell the whole truth and he has
Riven m c assurance that he will do
BO."
District Attorney Seymour then an-
Fwered McXab as to his willingness to
have Jordan go on the stand.
"I presume that a word of expla
nation is due," he said, "in view of
the stand 1 have taken here against
the accused Senators being sworn. It
had been my intention to object to
Mr. Jordan testifying as a witness In
this case, as I have done regarding
the accused Senators, but in the inter
ests of justice I think that he should
testify for the people. He under
stands that if he falsifies that a charge
of perjury stares him in the face and
he also understands that if he tells the
truth he will be absolved from fur
ther prosecution. He desires me to
say that he will keep his pledge to
tell the truth and if he does this, and
I believe he will, every man here
ought to take his hand and honor him
for his desire to leave for those he
Joves the priceless heritage of a good
name."
Cator and Jacobs objected in vain
while the District Attorney was voic
ing his last remarks, but he raised his
voice above their protest and finished
with a sweep of eloquence that
caused the chairman to stand up and
hold aloft his hand in warning that
a demonstration would not bÂ« toler
ated.
JORDAN'S STORY.
Jordan was then called to the stand
and with every- eye upon him and
every ear strained to catch his words
he told his story. It is as follows
"I am a resident of San Francisco.
I am a Journalist and have been stop
ping here at 1116 Seventh street since

Grange and have been doing his ad- J
vertlsins tor him for some time.
"The reason of my coming here was j
to represent the Evening Post of San
Francisco as its correspondent. It was
my habit to go to San Francisco every
Friday or Saturday, and upon the sec- '
ond Saturday that I went below I found ;
a Mter waiting for me from ilr. .
Grange, asking me to call and see him.
This was on th& 14th of January. The
1 ing morning I rang him up and
he wanted to know what I was doing
iii Sacramento.
'1 told him I was the secretary of the
SÂ«n Francisco Senatorial delegation, in
addition to the correspondent of the
PoÃt. He said that was good; that leg
islation was coming up in Sacramento
in whi^h he was interested and he
would like to have me look out for it.
"To begin with, he said he would
like to nave me gvt all bills that had
b.-en introduced relating to building
and loans. 1 informed him I would
be down the following Saturday. He
said that was good, as It was impor
tant that he see me and that there
vraa good money in it for me. I
went to the State Printer's office and
got the bills, two copies of each. On !
Saturday, 21. I went below.
"A message was waiting for me at
tht (<m'-e of the Post, telling me to i
ring him up. I told him I could not
see him as I had an engagement to
go to the theater with my wife. He
rang me up again, however, and was
Insistent that 1 come out and bring j
the bille.
< ALLS AFTER THEATER.
"I finally consented to drop out and â 
see him on roy way home, and he asked |
me how things were looking. I told him I
1 thought they were going to do things :
to us. He then asked me what I j
thought of pending investigations" and j
I told him I believed that not only the
â¢.^ntal but all of the loan com
panies would be investigated. He then
asked me what I thought of the status
of the commission, whether I thought
there were any business men among
its members.
"I asked him what he meant and he
said, Do you think any of the mem
ber? will do business; can you ap
proach any of them?' I <â¢â¢;>.! ?e<l over
the names and he then asked me how
ood.
"He said Bauer was with the build
ing and loan companies and wanted to
know if I knew the other members well
enough to talk to them. He asked me
to go and sound them â see if there were
any that could be bought. I told him
I thought if any of them could that
it would be Bunkers, Wright, French
and Emmons. He asked me to see
them and see what I could do.
"I told him I could not see them all,
as only Bunkers and French were in
the city. He asked me to go and see
them and try to see what I could do.
He said his company did not fear in
vestigation, but he did not want to be
put to the trouble of going up to Sac
ramento.
"He said there were four of the com
panies, the Phpenix, Pacific States,
Renters and Continental, working to
gether, and he asked me what it would
be worth to protect them.
FIXES PRICE AT $250.
"I told him I thought it would be
worth $250 apiece. He told me to see
I th.t Senators and get them to make a
proposition to protect three, if not four
of the companies. I told him I would
not attempt to do his- bidding in the
I case of th<; Continental, there was so
; much talk about it. ~ I went to the
theater that night. Later I found
j Bunkers and asked him what could be
I done.
"He told me he would see French to'
see what could be done and asked me
Ito see him the next day at noon. I
kept the engagement, but he had not
! seen French. I asked him if he did
â¢ not think $250 apiece would be about
right. He said that four would have
! to be taken care of and that he did
not know what they should expect.
"I went to .Grange with this, but he
eaid it was unsatisfactory â that he
wanted a definite proposition. I told
him I would return to Sacramento and
would report the figures to him by
telephone. He asked me what I thought I
I should be entitled to for my share in
the work, and asked me if $250 would
1 not be about right. When I reached
Sacramento I went to Bunkers and had
another talk. He said he had agreed
with French that $500 apiece would be
about right to take care of the three
companies â that the Continental could
take care of itself.
"He said the case of the Continental
was different; that t.iey couldn't touch
it for less than $10,000. I told Grange
he would have to come up and see me
about that. He told me he was going
to see the Senators and the Pacific
States, and that he could answer him
self for the Phoenix â that it would be.
all right. He said the Continental could
take care of itselfâ that he would not
lay my proposition before it.
"He again nsked me what I expect
'd i\* my share, and I told him he had
said $250 woulid be right, and we agreed
â  hat sum.
"He agreed that if he telegraphed me
he would ufo the name Bill Newell and
assure me that he would be up. Later
he rang me up and told me there had
been a change in the programmeâ that
lid not come up, but that a man
would come up who had been instruct
ed to go to my room. I told him all
right.
TICHFXOR IS NEWELL.
"Finally the man I now know to be

him there must be a mistake, that they

Bunkers would not agree to having

that he did not believe the other Sen

JORDAN TELLS OF PAYING THE SENATORS
I said to French "I'm going to hand you something 1 ." He said "All right" and
I gave him the roll of bills. He took them and put them in his pocket. Next I
went uptown to look for Wright. * * * Then Bunkers called me over to the
cuvh 'Aiv.\ said his roll was short $50. I told him I had seen the money counted out
by Tiehenor and thought there were four $350 packages. "Well," Bunkers said,
"right is right, and if the others get $350, I ought to get it too." I said I had
Wright's roll si ill in my pocket and would count it. I went inside and did this
and found it contained $350, seven $50 bills. I then started to my luncheon and
met former Senator Tyrrell of Nevada City. He walked with me and at Ninth and
X streets we met Wright, and Tyrrell told him he wanted to talk with him. I said
I did too, and taking W.right aside I told him to meet me at 2 o'clock at the Irish
Tavern and I could give aim the money. I went there and talked to Danny Walsh,
the proprietor, for awhile and in five minutes Wright came along * * * * *
We went inside and I gave him the bills. I told Emmons about Bunkers' claim of
shortage. He said the matter ought to be fixed up and he would see that it was â

"Tichenor, as I now know him. told
me all he wanted was some assorance
that 1 would do the right thing and
pay the money, and asked me if 1
could arrange to pay it so he could see j
me I said I would try it, and I again j
went to the State Capitol to see the .
Senators. Bunkers told me they ,
couldn't trust a stranger, and that un
less some other plan could be agreed
on it would be the end of the matter.
I agreed to meet Tichenor at the Golden
Eagle at 5 o'clock, but he did not come.
'Afterward he told me he went
down to the Western because he didn't
care to be seen. I asked him if any
one knew him. He said he knew Em
mons. Finally he said he would be
satisfied if I took the money and dft?
trithited it to the rest. I finally told
him that it would be all right for him
to see me pay the men.
PLANS DECEPTION.
"It was my purpose to pretend to
cany out some- plan he might suggest
and make him think I had paid them
while he was looking, but It was not
my intention to do so.
"We then went to the room again. He
took the money out of his pocket and
made up four packages of $350 each. At
my suggestion he rolled them up into
small mils and I put two of them into
my right hand trousers pocket, one into |
my left hand troueers pocket and one |
into my right hand vest pocket.
"He said he would have the extra
$100 (or me by 7 o'clock and I then
left him and went into Hanlon's sa
loon, where I met Emmons. He and
I came out and walked diagonally
across the street, where we saw Mar
tin Kelly talking with some friends.
We also' met Senator Welch and sa
luted him and went down to the club ,
at 1109 Eighth street. We looked
around there a few minutes and then
came out.
"Tichenor was on the corner of X
and Eighth streets, across X street \
from us. We walked south on X j
street, and when about the middle of
the block I told Emmons I would
shake hands and say good by. We
passed Bunkers and I hailed him
and told him I would see him soon.
At Ninth and X streets I shook hands
with Emmons, and as I did so I
placed in his hands one of the rolls
of bills.
"He put the bills in his pocket and
went on his way. I returned and met
Tichenor and asked him if he had seen
me pay Emmons. He said yes that it
was all right. I then told him I would
see Bunkers.
"I crossed the street and met Bun
kers near the Clunie Opera-house and
v/o walked up X street and turned up
Eighth near Hanlon's saloon. A little
way from the corner we stopped and
I took out one of the rolls of bills,
shook hands with him and gave him
the money in the shake. He took it
and we separated. I rejoined Tichenor
and he told me that he had seen me
pay Bunkers and that it was all right.
TALK WITH FRENCH.
Senator Simpson carried Jordan back
to the conversation with French, who
had asked the witness whether it was
the Pacific Coast Company that was
mentioned among those to be protected.
Upon being informed that it was the
Pacific States French said that was all
right, but that he would not stand for
the other companyâ the Pacific Coast.
Testifying about the attempt to find
French and Wright at the committee
headquarters at 817 Tenth street, Jor
dan corroborated the testimony of
Tiehenor up to the time the detective
left him in front of the place. Jordan
brought himself and the detective to
the headquarters and then said:
"Tiehenor said we were a little late,
that they had evidently all gone inside.
I couldn't get Inside at all. French
sent out word by the colored man that
he wouldn't see any newspaper men. I
told the colored man to go back and tell
him it was Jordan. The man came back
and said he could not get in at all.
Tichenor then went down town, after I
had told him I would meet him in front
of the headquarters at 10 o'clock.
"I waited there and saw the whole
committee come out. I walked down
Tenth street, but didn't find Tichenor.
The members of the committee went
their way, but I waited half an hour
along there for Tichenor. Then I
thought I would go to the Western
Hotel, where he roomed, and try to
find him there. I met him on X street,
a little bolow the Golden Eagle Hotel.
He said he didn't understand that I
was to meet him on Tenth street.
"'Did you pay them?' he asked, and
I replied, 'Why, certainly.'
" 'I am sorry I didn't see you.' he
said, 'but that is all right as long as
you paid the money.' *
"He then asked me if we should co
some place r where he could give me the
money coming to me without beine:
seen, and I said 'No, pay me right
here,' and he gave me three fifty-dollar
bills. Then he went to the depot after
the other $100. which he said was
around somewhere.
PAYS COIN TO FRENCH.
"Then I met French and asked him
to go with me to the Irish Tavern at the
corner of Seventh and I streets. We
walked down Seventh street to J.
where we were overhauled by Senator
Carter. After he left us we walked
on and about a quarter of a block far
ther toward I street. I said to French.
'I am going to hand you something.'
He said, 'All right,' and I gave him
the roll of bills. He took them and DUt
them in his pocket.
"Next I went up town to look for
Wright. I went to the Capitol and
Golden Eagle hotels and in the Golden
Eagle I met Tichenor again. He said
he had the other $100 for me and we
walked around the corner on to Sixth
street, where he gave it to me. We
had a bottle of wine at the Capitol and
then I left to get aboard the train for
San Francisco.
"The next morning, Wednesday, a
little before noon, I saw French in front
of the Capitol Hotel and he asked me I
if 1 had seen Wright. I said 'no,' and j
he said Wright was looking for me. I '
said, "I am looking for him, too.'
"Then Bunkers called me over to the
curb and said his roll was short $50. I
told him I had seen the money counted
out by Tichenor and thought there
four $350 packages.
" 'Well,' Bunkers said, 'right is right j
and if the others get $350 I ought to ,
get it too.'" I said I had Wright's roll |
still in my pocket and would count it. |
I went inside and did this and found
it contained $360, seven fifty-dollar
bills.
BOODLE GIVEN WRIGHT.
"I then started up to my luncheon ,
and met former Senator Tyrrell of
Nevada City. He walked with me and j
at Ninth and X streets we met Wright |
and Tyrrell told him he wanted to I
talk with him. I said I did too, and j
taking Wright aside I told him to j
meet me at 2 o'clock at the Irish Tav
ern and I would give him the money.
I went there and talked to Danny
Walsh, the proprietor, for awhile and
in five minutes Wright came along. I
saw him outside across the street. We
went inside the saloon and into the
lavatory and I gave him the bills.
"I walked up I to Tenth with him
and he went to a meeting of the com
mittee and sent Senator Emmons
down. I told Emmons about the short
age. He said the matter ought to be
fixed up and he would see that It
was."
"Had you talked to Wright person
ally on what this matter was about?"
asked Simpson.
"I don't remember that I did," re
plied the witness.
"Did you have a conversation with
any of the Senators prior to paying
them the bills as to what they would
have to do for being paid?"
"Yes," was the reply.
"Did you have any talk with them
as to the services to be rendered?"
asked Simpson.
"It was understood they were not
to subpena the Phoenix or the Rent
ers' Building and Loan Association,"
replied Jordan.
"What Senators did you talk with?
"Senator Bunkers did most of the
talking."
"Did you have a conversation witn
French?"
"To this effect. He met me during a
recess of the Senate on Monday and
asked me what companies were to te
taken care of. I told him the Renters,
Phoenix and the Pacific States."
DETAILS OF AGREEMENT.
In reply to questions Jordan repeated
Emmons' statement that he would "not
stand for" Tichenor paying him the
money, and was then asked:
"You never had an agreement to pay
Emmons money for immunity for these
companies?"
"No, sir," he replied.
"Did you ever mention any com
panies to him?" waa asked.
"Only the Phoenix," was the reply.
"Did you have any conversation
with Wright about what the money
was for?" asked Belshaw. .
"None at all," said Jordan.
"When you talked with Bunkers on
Tuesday," asked Simpson, "did you
say the other Senators were to aid
these companies?"
"No, that waa understood when I
saw Bunkers in San Francisco on Sun
day," said Jordan.
"Did Bunkers arrange to flee the
other Senators?" asked Belshaw.
"Xo," replied the witness.
There were a few scattering and un
important questions from the commit
tee and then Attorney Nicol said his
side would not undertake to cross
examine the witness without a tran
script of the testimony. Attorney Ca
tor said the same thing for nig side.
Reporter Vaughn said he could have
a transcript of Jordan's testimony
ready for the attorneys by to-morrow
afternoon at 3 o'clock.
SPEAK FOR TICHENOR.
James G. Maguire of San Francisco
was called at the opening of the session
to testify to Tichenor's good character:
"You were once the Democratic candi
date for the office of Governor of Cali
fornia, were you not?" asked Gould.
"That is a subject I do not care to al
lude to very often," answered Judge
Maguire, and the audience joined him |
in a laugh.
Judge Maguire then testified that he
had known Tichenor for some time and
had employed him and had found his
veracity and integrity beyond question.
D. S. Hirschberg, former manager
of the Preston School of Industry,
testified that he had known Tichenor
for many years in Oakland and San ,
Francisco and that his reputation is
good. H. Blodgett, a resident of Bak
ersfield. engaged in the oil business,
testified that he had never heard the
reputation of the detectives discussed, I
so he was dismissed. 1
H. D. Morton, proprietor of Mor
ton's Special Delivery and w r ell known
in other lines of business in San Fran
cisco, testified thÂ»t he had employed
Tichenor and believed his reputation
to be good. B. F. Kenble, superin
tendent of Pinkerton's San Francisco
agency, testified that Tichenor's rep
utation is good.
HIS CHARACTER GOOD.
Phillip Conradl, a merchant of Oak
land, testified that he had engaged in
business with Tichenor and that his
reputation is good. F. W. Thompson,
San Francisco agent of the Rock Is
land System, also testified his reputa
tion is good. Andrew Carrlgan, vice
president of the Dunham, Carrigan,
Hayden Co., said Tichenor's reputation
is good.
Oscar Jones, a resident of Alameda,
formerly of Downieville, testified that
Hartling's reputation is good.
Ex-Senator R. F. Del Valle of Los
Angeles testified that Tichenor's repu
tation is good. 4 \
F. G. Finlayson, an attorney of Los
Angeles, testified to the same fact, and
added that through long acquaintance
he knew Tichenor to be a very conser
vative man.
Captain of Detectives Braddish of
Los Angeles also gave Tichenor a good
reputation. H. D. Bailey, who said he
has resided in Los Angeles one year
and one day, the southern agent of the
- Pinkertons, Bald Tichenor's reputation
is good. F. A. Baldwin, a merchant of
San Francisco, who has known Tiche
nor for twenty-nine years, testified to
the same fact.
As soon as Baldwin left the stand it
was announced that more character
witnesses would be called to-morrow
evening, but in view of later develop
ments it is not thought their services
will be required, for the detectives
stand corroborated in every detail' of
their testimony.
CALLS LAWS A FARCE.
Grange Thinks Building and Loan
Statutes Need Changing.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 8.-The special
committee of the Senate appointed in
place of that on Commissions and Re
trenchments to investigate building and
loan associations held Its first meeting
this evening in the Senate chamber.
The only witness was James L. Field,
for ten years secretary of the State
Building and Loan Commission.
He said the main cause of the com
plaints was the fact that the investors
did not read their certificates. In some
cases misrepresentations of agents
were responsible. There were legisla
tive remedies for whatever faults ex
isted, he said, but his experience had
shown that the laws as they existed
had been complied with by every asso
ciation In the State.
Just as the session was breaking
up Clarence Grange, secretary of the
Phoenix Association, said to the com
mittee: "The laws as they exist are
an absolute farce."
"Many meanings can be placed on
the word, 'Farce,' eaid Curtin. "What
do you mean?"
"I mean that the laws covering
building and loan associations, as they
exist, afford absolutely no protection
to' either the investor or the borrower.
By the investor I mean the man that
l invests In the shares of companies and
by the borrower the person that bor
rows funds therefrom and before this
Investigation is concluded I should like
the privilege of suggesting legislative
remedies."
Grange was assured that he would
be given such opportunity.
The committee will hold another ses
sion to-morrow morning at 9:80.
DRAINAGE MEASURES.
Fear Is Felt That Bills Will Be De-
feated.
reated.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 8. â A fear is
expressed by those Interested In the
swamp land and reclamation meas
ure presented before the Assembly
that it will not be passed and that no
legislation on this important matter
will be accomplished at this session.
Dissension is rife among those who
are to be affected by the proposed
reclamation scheme. Some who have
land that is amply protected do not
care to be assessed to reclaim lands
belonging to others and the exclusion
of some tracts thoroughly reclaimed is
arousing opposition on the part of
owners of unreclaimed holdings.
There is to be another meeting of
the Committee on Swamp and Over
flowed Lands and Drainage this week
and the various objections to the bill
submitted will be heard.
WOODLAND, Feb. 8. â The Board
of Supervisors to-day unanimously
; adopted resolutions opposing the
j drainage "bill now pending in the Leg
islature and instructing the county's
representatives to use all honorable
means to defeat the measure.

Fight Early Closing Move
Special DUpatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. B.â ln the As
sembly this morning McCartney intro
duced a concurrent resolution that bot.
houses of the Legislature terminate thy
session on Saturday, March 4, which
would give a sixty-one day session.
The resolution was referred 10 the
Ways and Means Committee.
McCartney s resolution is the resuir
of the movement that has been on foot
for some days in both the Senate and
the Assembly to arbitrarily adjourn at
the expiration of the statutory aixty
days, whether the business of the Leg
islature was finished or not. Many
members who have important measures
that are well down on the flies will op
pose the movement.
Stanton got through with one vote
his measure making oral contracts to
sell real estate binding. Attempts to
pass this measure through the Assem
bly have failed at previous sessions.
McCartney's bill providing for the ap
pointment of an attorney to appear for
defendants not represented in divorce
cases was defeated.
A precursor of the debates that may
be expected when the general game bill
is taken up for serious consideration
came this morning, when Burke'a meas
ure changing the law relative to shoot
ing game birds at night was reached
on the final passage file. The present
law provides that there shall be no
shooting of game birds between a half
hour after sundown and a half-hour
before sunrise. Burkes amendment is
that there shall be no shooting of such
birds between 6 p. m. and 6 a. m.
Hawkins was opposed to changing
the present game laws, as they wer<Â»
satisfactory, he said. Manwell said
Burkes bill shut off the best hour of
shooting in certain 9easons^ â that before
sundown.
The Assembly was dizzied by the va
riety of opinions that even this small
measure brought out, and the matter
went over till to-morrow, the members
sighing when they contemplated what
is In store when the general bill is
taken up.
A resolution providing for the pay
ment of mileage for the Public Chari
ties and Corrections Committee waa
presented by Chairman Coghlan, JDJJ
announced that the committee wouT*
report to-morrow. Coghlan says he is
not sure whether the committee will
consider in it 3 report the alleged in
considerate treatment of legislators' by
the State Board of Charities and Cor
rections.
Houser secured permission for re
consideration of his bill permitting law
graduates of the University of South
ern California to be admitted to the
bar by the Supreme Court on their
diplomas. It is understood the author
of the bill will amend it so as to in
clude Stanford University, and that in
this form it will pass.
Branstetter's bill making it a felony
to kill an elk anywhere in the State
was passed.
Assemblyman Waste announced that
it had been found impracticable for
the entirely Assembly to accept the in
vitation of President Wheeler of the
State University to visit that institu
tion on Friday, and a committee con
sisting of Prescott. Waste, Stantoo,
Hawkins, Treadwell and Johnstone
were appointed to make the trip.

ing for compulsory vaccination of
school children throughout the State

against the funds of the various school
districts.

plants may sell lamps and lighting fix
tures to consumers at cost.
SIGNING OF CONVENTION
WITH SANTO DOMINGO
WASHINGTON. Feb. 8. â Minister
Dawson has cabled the Stats Depart
ment from San Domingo that the new
protocol providing for the control of
Santo Domingo finances by the United
States was signed yesterday. The
document is expected here early next
week and will be submitted immedi
ately to the Senate.
An important feature of the protocol
is the omission -of the provision in thÂ«
original memorandum of January 21,
guaranteeing the integrity of Santo
Domingo. The new document simply
binds the United States to respect th- 1
integrity of Dominican territory. The
Monroe doctrine Is regarded as suf
ficient to convey the broader guaran
tee.
Gunboat Newport Is Safe.
NEW YORK, Feb. B.â The Mallory

peller at sÂ«a on February 3. When

H OUSE LEADERS
TALK POLITICS
WASHINGTON. Feb. S.â For five ;
hours in the House to-day the question j
of freight rates regulation held full i
sway. As on the previous days of the â 
debate .both Republicans and .Demo- â¢
crais claimed the credit for originating;
ihe present legislation. .', j
Esch of Wisconsin, who M ted in (
framing the Tounsend bill, summed up
the arguments for and against that bill
up to the present time. Some, he said.
had regarded it as the most important i
legislation e=inee the rebellion, while I
others had contended it amounted to j
nothing. Such extreme views he held
to be indicative of the fact that the bill
*as v.hat it was claimed to be â a com- :
promise.
Grosvenor of Ohio ridiculed the Dem- i
ocrats for their claim to credit for rate :
legislation. He provoked laughter]
â¢when he declared that, "following our]
footsteps, toernarking our tracks, .
camping to-night where we camped I
last night, and begging to be taken on
board, is not .a new policy or principle j
cf the Democratic party."
Grosvenor was discussing the rela- !
tive merits of the several bills when he
â was interrupted by Shackleford 91 Mis
souri with the statement that the
Hearst bill had been denied an oppor- !
tunity to be considered.
Oh," replied Grosvenor. amid laugh- j
ter and Republican applause, "your
party denied it before we did."
The Hearst bill, he declared, was as
dead as Julius Caesar, having been j
slaughtered by a Democratic caucus.
James ot New York accused the Pres- \
ident of taking the platform of the
Democratic party "that bears the !
bloody stain of Bryan's faithful feet,"
and holding it up to the people of the
country. He cared not how much it
was said that the Democrats were fol
lowing the President. He knew that \
the soldiers of the United States fol- ]
lowed the President gallantly at San
Juan Hill.
"But." he added, "no more. sir, than
th<? Democracy w-il follow him when
he charges the Harrimans. the Vander
biits, the Cassatts and the Hills in this
country of wealth."
The Democrats applauded Heflin of
Alabama when he said that William J.
Bryan, th<? Daniel of Democracy, had
advocated the present legislation be
fore the people of â  he country .
In a characteristic speech Oaves of
Tennessee, who was thÂ«Â» sole Democrat
who voted with the Republicans on the
adoption of the rule, said he did so be
reuse he found them right on the ques
tion, even though they gritted their
teeth after having been "egged" on by
the President, who had applied the
cat-o'-nine- tails to their backs.

CONTEST OVER
WATER IN KERN
BAKERSFIELD, Feb. Xâ What will
probably result in one of the hardest
fought legal battles the county has
ever seen was commenced to-day by
the filing of a complaint bjf Miller &
Lux. the K>rn County Land Company
and all of the canal companies owned
jointly or severally by the two corona
tions against the Associated Oil Com
pany, a branch of the Standard, the
cum Development Company and
other oil companies operating in the
Kern River field.
It is contended in the complaint that
the various oil companies made parties
defendant in tht- suit have bored nu
merous water wells on lands adjacent
to the natural channel of Kern River
and by means of powerful pumping
machinery are drawing enormous quan
tities of water from the river, thereby
greatly decreasing its natural flow. An
injunction is asked to restrain the de
fendants from continuing to pump
water from the ground, and especially
at points above the intakes of the va
rious* canals owned by the different
companies.
WOMAN CHOOSES
TO DIE BY FIRE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACuMA, Feb. B.â Mrs. Thomas Ehr
hart, the wife of a former cook at the
Wisconsin Lumber Company's mill,
four miles west of Chehalis, last night
saturated her clothing with oil and
went to an outhouse and set her cloth
ing on fire. The woman was burned to
death before aid could reach her. De
spondency was the cause of the suicide.

COMERFORD IS EXPELLED
FROM ILLINOIS ASSEMBLY
Member Who Preferred Charges of
Bribery Punished by the Men
He Accused.
SPRINGFIELD, 111.. Feb. B.â Frank
D. Comerford, a Representative from
the Second Senatorial District of Cook
County to the Thirty-fourth General
Assembly, was to-day expelled as a
member of that body and his name
stricken from the rolls of the House of
Assembly. His expulsion was the cli
max of a series of sensational charges
of corruption and attempted bribery
made by Comerford ag.-.inst members
of the Illinois Legislature in a lecture
before a law college in Jhicago, which
were investigated by a special commit
tee of the House and declared to have
been unfounded.
comerford was cited to appear before
the bar of the House and show cause
why he should not be expelled. In a
brilliant speech of more than an hour's
duration he reviewed the testimony
taken before the investigating commit
tee and fiercely scored the committee
for so limiting the scope of the investi
gation that "God Almighty himself, if
he came here, would have been pre
vented getting evidence against a self
confessed thief." He continued:
"This committee stands convicted be
fore the country' of resorting to subter
fuges to prevent any real investiga
tion."
On roll call the resolution of expul
sion was adopted. 121 to 13. Eight

Special Dispatch to Tht Call.
CALL BUREAU, POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON, Feb. B.â The confusion
of mÂ«ny members of the Senate with
regard to the amendment of Kearns
transferring 7000 square miles out of
the northwest corner of Arizona to
T'tah was an interesting feature in the
fifsht over the statehood bill. The gen
eral understanding when the bill
passed last night was that the failure
of Arizona to get within the Union
lines had carried defeat with it to the
Kearns amendment, and, as Senator
Kearns was believed to have voted
against his convictions on the bill, in
consideration of a promise of its cham
pions to carry this amendment for him,
the pleasure its defeat gave the other
side was not concealed. But when it
was developed under discussion to-day
that the amendment, having been reg
ularly adopted, would hold good, not
withstanding Arizona remained out of
the statehood reckoning; the general
chagrin was no less evident than the
satisfaction had been.
Kearns had offered as argument for
tho amf-ndment that the territory in
cluded in the transfer was made inac
cessible to officers of the law of Ari
zona by the Grand Canyon of the Colo
rado, which they could not cross, save
by a great detour carrying them
through .several States, and that the
strip was in consequence a rendezvous
of criminals menacing to Utah, whose
peace officers could not follow them
across the State line.
The interesting fact was disclosed
to-day that the Senate Committee on
Public Lands reported a bill granting
to J. ty Butts right of way for a trail
leading through the Grand <"any<~n,
with thr right to build a great suspen
sion bridge over tho main canyon. The
daring and picturesque nature of the
enterprise proposed lends Its added in
1 tareai to the fact that it will, when
completed, overcome the difficulty that
allowed Utah to filch 7000 square miles
of the Territory of Arizona, without
giving her anything whatever in re
turn.
ITAH SENATOR BADLY MIXED.
Reams Claims Ho Voted "Nay" on
Banl's Amendment.
WASHINGTON. Feb. B.â The Senate
to-day received from Kearns of Utah
a disclaimer of the vote in favor of
separate statehood for New Mexico,
with which the records for yesterday
credited him. He said that he had
been misunderstood by the clerks and
that he had voted against the provis
ion. Several Senators corroborated his
statement, but a number asserted that
they had understood him to vote for
the amendment. Immediately after
opening prayer Kearns took the floor
and said:
I rise "to a question of personal privilege.
In the first vcte on thÂ«> amendment of th^
Senator from California i.Mr Bard) last even-
Ing I votPd "nay" In a distinct manner. It
appears the clerk misunderstood me, and I
was numbered ameng these favoring the amend
ment.
The statement had the effect of bring
ing a number of Senators to their feet
and to call out from them a number
of statements as to their understanding
of the Utah Senator's vote. The first
of these was made by Nelson, who sits
near Kearns in the Senate, who said:
"I was sitting near the Senator from
Utah when he voted and heard him
vote 'no' distinctly."
On the other hand, Foraker, sitting
somewhat farther away, received an
opposite impression. He said that he
had been keeping a tally and had dis
tinctly iieard Kearns vote in the
affirmative
Other Senators sustaining kelson's
view were Quarles, Clapp, Kittredge.
McComas, Scott, Dubois. Dallinger,
Hansbrough, Clay and Gorman. 'All
expressed the conviction that the rec
ord of the clerks was justified.
Rejoicing in New Mexico.
ALBUQUERQUE, N. M., Feb. B.â
Great enthusiasm prevails throughout
the Territory over the passage of the
statehood bill by the JS&nate, with the
amendment admitting New Mexico as
a separate State. Mass meetings and
Jollifications were held here and In
other New Mexico cities. The Legis
lature this afternoon passed resolu
tions thanking the United States Sen

His name is Terence Fields, 11% years old,

PUBLIC ENJOYS
POLACCO NIGHT
AT THE TIVOLI
Last night was a Polacco night at I
the Tivoli, with a brilliant and power
ful interpretation of "Andre Chenier"
Ito his credit. Signor Polacco had the
[ honor to conduct the premiere of the
i opera in Milan under the guidance of
the composer, and has here had better
opportunity in rehearsals than with
most others of the operas given. Last
mini's production accordingly showed
I the conductor at his best, as a leader of
striking resourcefulness, utmost intelli
and thorough musicianship.
Signor Polacco was most ably seconded
by the orchestra, which was in excell
ent form and luminously illustrated the
rfully picturesque and most sym
pathetic reading of the conductor.
The principals concerned were
Frosinl in the title role, La Puma as
Girard, and Berlindi as Maddalena,
Frosini showed up in excellent fashion,
giving a virile and dramatic portrait
of Chenier, effective from the vocal
side, wanting something perhaps of
poetry, but on the whole very satisfy
ing. His debut with Berlindi in, the
second act aroused large enthusiasm.
Berlindi added yet more to her large
score as Maddalena. evincing all her
usual line- sincerity, picturesque emo
tional powers and vocal capability. La
Puma surprised. His Qirard showed
unusual temperamental grip and was
sung in part with the fine vocal power
he occasionally permits us to suspect,
and acted in spots as if he had
quitf forgotten La Puma. The
more rapidly and fully he can for
get him is evidently the secret of suc
cess for the singer. Cortesi again was
capital as usual as the dandy. Miss
Barker as Bersi furnished much i
P' sture and little voice, but as Made- I
lon supplied a really effective bit of !
acting and singing. The chorus did ex
oellent credit to Signor Longo's train
ing last nightâ it did its best work so
far of the season. The production was
altogether notable--if Mr. Jordan's
Sacramento solo had not been such a
brilliant affair I should say so at more
length.
BLANCHE PARTI NGTON
The Dolnietsehes.
The Dolmetsches at Lyric Hall last
evening inducted an intensely musical
audience into the music of the time
of William Shakespeare. All the in
strumental and the vocal numbers
were from Shakespeare's time and
many of them were alluded to and
were used in the performances of his
plays when he was alive. Mr. Dol
metachc made clear hitherto obscure
portions of Shakespeare's text by ex
plaining the office and significance of
the music that Shakespeare knew.
Mrs. Dolmetsche and Miss Salmon
ably assisted. The music was
sweet and much more pretentious
than might be supposed to be the ease
< onsidering its antiquity. Its chief
characteristics were delicacy and
grace. This evening Mr. and Mrs.
Dolmetsche and Miss Salmon will il
lustrate the Italian music of the sev
enteenth and eighteenth centuries.

AVERS WIRING
IS DANGEROUS
City Electrician of Alameda
Asserts Live Lines Are Not
Insulated in a Safe Manner
LIABLE TO CAUSE FIRES
Thinks City Trustees Should
Enact Measure Regulating
the Wiring of Buildings
ALAMEDA. Feb. B.â City Electri
cian Joseph B. Kahn, who succeeded
G. A. Wiese as the head of the Mu
nicipal Electric Light and Power
Works, declares that much of the
electrical wiring done in local resi
dences and business buildings is un
safe and not in conformity with the
requirements of the National Board of
Underwriters.
Kahn asserts that .he has already
inspected numerous houses, and in
many of them he found that the elec
tric wires were without the proper
insulations and were run through par
titions without being prevented from
coming in contact with the woodwork.
Regarding- the result of his investiga
tions Kahn said:
Taking: into consideration the manner In
which live wires have bain run through many
building* here, it is a surprise to me that
there have not been more fires started as a
i>-^ult of deficient insulation. Wires that
should be heavily Insulated I found In many
instances almost bare an>i to rest directly on
vi ,Uv, rk. instead of betiuc kept away from
the walls by proper porcelain fittings. I am
Jt accusing any one of careless wiring, but
there i<= ample evidence that a great deal of
wiring has been dune in Alameda in a manner
that would nut be recognized as safe by the
national board of underwriters. I believe the
situatit n â¢lemande action by the City Trustees.
An ordinance should be passed stipulating
JuÂ«t how electrical wiring should be done in
Alameda.
ATTEMPTS TO EVADE
FEDERAL INJUNCTION
Scavengers' Attorney Thinks He Can
Find a Way to Get Around
a Restraining Order.
OAKLAND, Feb. 8. â How to cir
cumvent the order of United States
Circuit Judge W. W^ Morrow restrain
ing the scavengers from doing business
in Oakland, pending final- decision in
the case of the Pacific Incinerating
Company, grave Attorney J. H. Cree^ley,
the scavengers' representative, a men
tal problem to-day. Creeley declares
he recognizes the full import of the
Federal Court's injunction, but he has
hopes of meeting the order and still
leaving room for his clients to continue
collecting garbage.
The scavengers, according to their
attorney, are not debarred from gath
ering "waste matter."
L. S. Church, attorney for the in
cinerating company, announced to-day
that the first scavenger who moved a
wheel after he had been served with
the order would be haled before the
Circuit Court for contempt. Church
contends that the temporary injunc
tion isÂ» in full effect and is binding
on the scavengers. The cases of twenty
recently arrest^ l scavengers were on
the Police Court dockets this morning,
but all of them were continued.

SURPRISE HIM
WITH CHARGES
Superintendent of Schools
Answers Letters He Has
Received From Citizens
WATEIiMAN'S FIGURES
Gives Account of Money Used
in Construction of the New
Carnegie Library Building
Berkeley Office San Francisco Can,
2148 Center street, Feb. 8.
Distressed and surprised because of
the receipt of letters charging that
there was "graft" in connection with
the construction of the $40,000 Carnegie
Library here, Superintendent of
Schools S. D. Waterman, who is also
president of the board of library trus
tees, to-day issued an "open letter to
the people of Berkeley," giving a de
tailed account of the expenditures in
connection with the building.
Mr. Waterman has a letter signed
"Charles Miller," in which the writer
says that he and "many of his friends"
will oppose the issuance of school
bonds in the sum of $150,000, aa pro
posed by the School Department, un
less he is assured that the money will
be in other hands than those ' which
built the Carnegie Library. The writer
asserts that "every contractor or citi
zen knows that the library could easily
have been constructed for $30,000, in
stead of the $40,000 that was expended."
Superintendent Waterman's reply to
this is in part as follows:
TO THE PEOPLE OF BERKELEY:
In accordance with a . promise made at the
opening of the new Library building:, and In
Justice to the public, who are entitled to know
about the manner in which their servants per
form their duties, the following- statement as
to the erection of the building; is made:
On November 3, 1903. bids were received by
the Board of Library Trustees for the erection
of the building according: to the plans of Mr.
John Galen Howard, which had already been
adopted.
The architect was authorized to consult with
the lowest bidder to Bee if the price could twÂ»
reduced to $35,000. On November 10 the archi
tect reported that he and Mr. Grelg had
changed the specifications, substituting brick
for terra cotta and stone, so as to make a re
duction of $3005; finished in pine, leaving the
figures at $33,985. Afterward, at the same
meeting it was decided to have the wood finish
In the main rooms of the second story and thp
main hallway on the first floor done in oak.
At a meeting held on November 23 the presi
dent and secretary were authorized to sogn
the contract with Mr. GrPig for the construc
tion of the building as sonn as exact figures
were agreed upon by Mr. Greig and the archi
tect.
On November 28, 1903, the contract was
signed for the erection of the building at a
cost of |34, 534. The books are open for inves
tigation.
The library trustees, besides Mr.
Waterman, are A. W. Nalor, president
of the First National Bank of Berke
ley; Professor Leon J. Richardson of
the Latin department of the University
of California; Charles Sleeper and
Charles P. Henry. None seem to know
who "Charles Miller" is who writes to
Superintendent Waterman.
FRANCO-TURKISH RUPTURE
DUE TO GERMAN THRIFT
Berlin Financiers In Complete Pos
session of Ottoman Empire's
Financial Field.
CONSTANTINOPLE, Feb. B.âGer
many's victory In capturing the con
tract for the rearmament of the Turk
ish artillery threatens to result in a
serious disturbance of Franco-Turkish
political relations. French Embassador
Constans proposes to leave Constanti
nople soon for Paris to consult with
Foreign Minister Delcasse. Meanwhile
the Embassador has informed the
Turkish Government that the French
market is closed to any fresh Turkish
loan.
Tewfik Pasha, the Turkish Foreign
Minister, tried to compromise by offer
ing to settle the Syrian Railway ques
tion in a manner satisfactory to the
French claimants and to purchase mil
itary equipment to the value of $2,300,
000 in France. The Embassador, how
ever, demanded the expenditure of
$6,000,000. being one-third of the value
of the new armament, with French
gun factories and the complete satisfac
tion of the French demands regarding
the railroads. These terms the Em
bassador declared to be final, and, not
having received a reply on February 6,
he informed the Turkish Government
that he refused to continue the nego
tiations, adding that the French mar
ket was closed to further Turkish
loans.
As a result of this notification the
Ottoman Bank withdrew its proposals
for the projected loan. The Deutsche
Bank then came to the Porte's aid with
an offer to assist the treasury. The
Germans are thus for the moment in
complete possession of the financial
field, and an irade has already been
promulgated ordering the purchase of
all the new guns in German factories,
but it has been decided only to rearm
sixty batteries at present, instead of
142, as originally proposed.
NEW COMET OBSERVED
AT LICK OBSERVATORY
Professor Altken Computes the Orbit
of Latest Member of Solar
System.
SAN JOSE, Feb, B.â Professor Aitken
of the Lick Observatory has observed
the faint comet discovered by Borelli
at Marseilles on December 28 last. For
eight nights the comet has been seen at
Lick, and in computing its orbit Dr.
Aitken has found that it is traveling in
an elliptical path around the sun. It
completes its orbit in seven years and
four months. It is thus a member of
our solar system. Its nearest approach
to the sun is between the earth and
Mars, and its greatest distance from
the sun is Just outside the orbit of Ju
piter. The comet is of the tenth mag
nitude and may be seen with a tele
scope of moderate size.
SUBTLEST OF POISONS

Chicago Physician Believes Curve

CHICAGO, Feb. 8. â Curare, the
most subtle and deadly poison j
known to modern science, Is believed I
by Dr. Joseph Springier, formerly
Coroner's physician, to have caused
the death of Johan Hoch's wives. Dr.
Springer Is convinced the fatal drug

gagement or wedding rings. He said
to-day:
By turning: the Inner edge of the ring, or
making it rough or sharp, or In any manner
applying the curare on the rough edge and
then slipping the ring on the finger no as to
cause the slightest abrasion of the skin death
would follow.
It would only be necessary for the slightest
quantity of the poison to reach the .blood

The Troubles of George E.
Lawrence Reach a Climax
and He Must Make Defense
. Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 8.
Despairing of being able to live with
her husband, Mrs. Laura I. Lawrence
began a second action of divorce I
against George E. Lawrence, clubman
j and bon vivant, to-day. Their troubles j
have gained publicity on a number of i
occasions owing to the fact that his [
life, she avers, is accompanied by the i
popping of many corks, in conse- ,
I quence of which he arrives at home in j
the small hours in an intoxicated con- j
] dition. When home, his wife alleges,
jif things do not go to suit him he I
, makes a wreck of the establishment. !
Lawrence is reputed to be worth !
$250,000 and has a monthly income j
of $500 which keeps him busy spend- I
ing it. Twice his wife has had to re
sort to the police to restrain him.
Last July she began an action for di
vorce, which she afterward dismissed,
their troubles having been patched up.
They were married at Napa in 1903
and have one child and have a pretty
home at 3655 Piedmont avenue.
A final decree of divorce was
granted Charles P. Reed to-day from
Winifred A. Reed on the ground of
desertion. Anna M. Mitchell has filed
an amended cross-complaint to the
divorce action brought by W. A.
Mitchell, a traveling salesman, and
eliminated all her charges of a more
serious nature than desertion.
"HAYFOOT, STRAWFOOT"
ORDER IS RESCINDED
Captain Xanee Relents and the Digni
fied Seniors Feel Greatly
Relieved.
BERKELEY, Feb. 8. â Captain J. T.
Nance to-day revoked the order re
quiring seniors to march in military
formation into classrooms for instruc
tion in the theory and practice of mili
tary science. This was the order
whose promulgation two months ago
when Captain Nance took charge of
that department of the university
caused a wild tumult on the campus,
followed by summary disciplining of
several riotous students. Hereafter
the dignified seniors will be permitted
to enter the department of military
science in their own way and will be
absolved from what they have termed
the childish method of "hayfoot,
strawfoot" to sit at the feet of Captain
Nance in his elucidations of the mys
teries of right face and left face and
the reasons therefore. Captain Nance
has not given an explanation for the
rescinding of the order. He has fol
lowed strict military custom and rule
In that regard.
LAVISHES GOLD
ON SWEETHEART
Small Boy Steals Coin and
Has a Gay Time Until
the Police Catch Him
Henry Gardemeyer, a 14-year-old
boy, who lives at 713 Polk street, is in
the City Prison accused of the theft of
$680 in coin from F. Kaiser, who con
ducts a delicatessen store under the
Gardemeyer apartments. The lad con
fesses that he took part of the money.
The sum of $107 was recovered, $80 of
which was in the possession of his
sweetheart, one year his junior.
In accounting for the missing balance
Gardemeyer tells a tale of buggy rides,
expensive suppers, theater parties, can
dy and ice cream sodas. His sweet
heart, Daisy Magnin of 17 Willow ave
nue, to whom he intrusted the sack of
gold soon after he had stolen it and
who supplied him with funds on de
mand, is also accused by him of having
appropriated a large sum to her own
use and of having made no account
of It.
Gardemeyer was formerly employed
by Kaiser, but quit his position about
six weeks ago to go to Portland. He
returned to this city on January 20 and
four days later came in possession of
the gold, which he knew was kept be
hind the cash register.
When he abandoned hope of return
ing the money he resolved that his
sweetheart and he should live the life
of the merry as long as the wealth held
out. Buggy rides to the cliff occurred
daily and theater parties were arranged
as evening diversion. Gardemeyer was
Â»ot shabby in his arrangement of mat
ters, and a box was always provided
for the party, as well as a sumptuous
supper afterward. Meantime the sack
grew smaller, and one day when some
thing over $100 had disappeared, of
which he had no knowledge and for
which he did not ask, ho took the cus
todian to task and asked for an ex- j
planation, and she could give none.
During these days of revelry Detec- '
tives Dinan and Wren were at work on \
| the case and had no difficulty in trac- '
ing the theft to the youth. They learned ,
of his lavish use of coin, anu last night
confronted him at his home with the
evidence they had. Gardemeyer broke I
down and confessed. The boy has not !
been charged yet, but the detectives
will make arrangements by which he
shall appear to answer before the juve
nile court.

TONS AGAINST FAMILY
Old Mariner Meets Sweet
heart of Early Days and
Leaves Her Large Bequest
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 8.
To prove by letters, acts, and deeds
to property that her husband had
i loved her for thirty-three years, but |
; that at his death he left a large share
j of his estate to another woman is the
i history of a day's session in the trial
of an action brought by Mollie
j Fletcher and her son Albert to have j
the will of her late husband, Captain!
]>Roy Fletcher, set aside on the '
ground that he was mentally unsound.
Fletcher was a , steamship captain.
He traveled up and down the coast.
A year or two before his death he met ,
a Mrs. Leveina Emerson of 245 Texas
street In San Francisco. The two had j
known each other in their ' childhood .
days in Maine, and a strange fancy
trek possession of the old salt. He.
then deserted his home for another's
and on the day he died left his own
home early in the morning and went
to that of Mrs. Emerson and died
there. He left . an estate of about
$30,000 and bequeathed Mrs. Emerson
a legacy of $2000 and an interest in a
ship. He disinherited his own son and
gave away all but a half of his prop
erty to strangers.
The son has brought the action to
have the will set aside, alleging that
his father had had no less than eight
apoplectic strokes and that after the
first one a. noticeable change came
over him which grew more marked as
the succeeding ones occurred until he
dfserted his friends for strangers.
The case is being heard before Judge
Ogden and a Jury. ' ~i~\;

COLLEGE GLEE CLUB MEN
DID NOT GO FLIRTING
Mills College President Gives Uni
versity Boys Clean Bill of
Health.
BERKELEY, Feb. 8. â Strenuous
denial ia made by the glee club men
of the university to-day of the edi
torial charges by J. P. Loeb in the
Californian that they misbehaved, by
flirting with the girls of Mills College,
during the concert there last Friday
night, and their denial is backed up
by an official statement from Mrs.
Mills, head of the girls' seminary, who
i.s exercised over the matter.
Mrs. Mills has written a letter to
Stuart Hawley, manager of the glee
club, in which she says the criticisms
of the singers' acts while at her college
are unfair and unfounded. She denies
that her girls were the subjects of
flirtatious attacks by the college visi
tors within her gates, and gives the
young collegians a clean bill of health,
as gentlemen and concert singers.

WHEN DIVORCES
BECOME FINAL
Supreme* Court Establishes
Status of the Absolute
Decrees Given in Error
Absolute divorces granted by certain
Superior Judges in the interim between
the passage of the interlocutory decree
law and the affirmation of its validity
by the Supreme Court are void accord
ing to an opinion signed by the seven
Justices of the State's highest tribunal
yesterday. It is held, however, that
the absolute divorce shall be con
sidered as an interlocutory decree and
the judgment may be made final on
application. The question was brought
before the Supreme Court on the pe
tition of James Grannis that Judge
Kunt be restrained from annuling his
previous judgment granting an abso
lute decree.
At the time the interlocutory divorce
law was passed, many legal experts
claimed the provision was invalid. In
accordance with this view. Judge Mel
vin of Oakland, Judge Rhodes of San
Jose and other Superior Judges in dif
ferent parts of California granted ab
solute divorces as they had done under
the old law. When the case was
brought before the Supreme Court,
the Justices sustained the validity of
the measure. Several people who had
remarried on the strength of the abso
lute decrees illegally rendered found
themselves in an unfortunate predica
ment.
In the Grannis case, the wife had
secured an absolute decree In July,
1603. In August, 1904, she asked that
the judgment be set aside in view of
the Supreme Court decision upholding
the interlocutory law. Judge Hunt
signified his intention of altering the
original order so as to make the 1903
decree interlocutory instead of final.
Grannis petitioned the Supreme Court
to restrain the Judge from taking any !
sui h action and requested that the '
divorce be made final from the date of !
entering the decree. The Justices say â 
that the absolute decree was illegal
and therefore void but that Judge
Hunt's subsequent order making it in- |
terlocutory was just.
After the Supreme Court had sus
tained the latter law, p. Claudius of ,
Oakland petitioned Judge Melvin to
make an absolute decree in plaintiffs
case interlocutory from the time the
judgment was rendered. Judge Melvin
made the order interlocutory from the
time the Supreme Court had sustained
th* law and Claudius appealed. It is
ordered that his interlocutory decree
be dated from 1903 as he desires.

Grewsotne Details of Awful Tragedy
Arc Given by Citizens of Auburn
AUBURN. Feb. B.â The picture of the
removal of the bodies of Mrs. Mary
Weber, Bertha Weber and little Earl
Web<br from the burning home on the
r.ight of November 10 last was vividly
portrayed by several witnesses of the
awful spectacle to-day. During the
recital Adulph Weber seemed listless.
He showed very little animation at
cither of the sessions, spending his
time In gazing ftfrtively about the
court room. His features at times wore
a worn and tired expression-
Clarence Gear was one of the princi
pal witnesses of the day. He related
at length the finding of the pistol with
which young Weber is said to have
killed his relatives in the Weber. barn.
He said that he found empty shells in
the chambers of the weapon. The pistol
was lying on one of the sills of the
barn. Before he touched the weapon,
sÂ»i<i the witness, he called to Detective ;
Homier to come and take it.
Beu Dc-pendener testified that he was
early at the scene of the fire. As he
was rushing around the burning house
hi said he met Adolph Weber and
heard some one sa\ , "Is there any one
in the house?"
"I heard some one say "I don't
know,' " continued the witness. "The
reply came from Adolph's direction."
The blood-stained undergarments of
Mary Weber were shown to J. T.
Walsh, an undertaker, for identiSca
tion. At the sight, of the grewsome
exhibit, Mrs. Snowden and Mrs. Hess,
sisters of the murdered woman, hurst ;
into tear?, but young Weber displayed
no emotion.
Guy Lukens told how he rushed to
the scene of the fire, and how, after
the window on the porch had been
broken in, he entered the front room
and in the darkness stumbled over the
bodies pf Mrs. Weber and Bertha
Weber. He described their removal
from the house.
George :u:h. who assisted in carry
ing out the bodies of Mary, Bertha and
lla rl Weber, was closely cross-exam
ined by Attorney Grove L. Johnson for
the defense. During the cross-exam
ir.ation Johnson said to Ruth. '"Several
days after tho burning of the Weber
h^roe did you not go down to Ophir
nnd there meet Fred Lutz and Charles ',
Vaughn?"
Ruth replied that he had been to
Ophir at that time.
"Did not Lutz say to you. 'Ruth, you

ADVEKTISEM
. THE A M.I I OF CHARCOAL.
Few Proplo Know How Useful It Is In
rreservlnc Health and Beauty..
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant end purifier in nature, but
fey.- realize its value when taken Into i
th'; human system for the same cleans-
lr>K purpose.
Charooal is a remedy that the more
you take of it the better; It Is not a
drug: at all, but simply absorbs the â 
prases and impurities always present in |
the stomach and intestines and carries
them out of the system.
Charcoal sweetens the breath after j
pmokinj?. drinking or after ratine
onions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im- i
proves the complexion, it whitens the
teeth ar.d further acts as a natural j
and eminently safe cathartic.
It absorbs the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels: it
disinfects the mouth and throat from ,
the poison of catarrh. Be^fS
All drusrgists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably th best
charcoal and the most for the money !
Is In Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges; they i
are composed of the finest powdered j
Willow charcoal nd other harmless |
antiseptics in tablet form, or rather in j
the form of largre, pleasant tasting ,
lozenges, the charcoal being mixed 1
with honey.
The daily use of these lozenges will
guon tell in a much improved condi- '
tion of the general health, better com- |
plfxion. sweeier breath and purÂ£r
blcod. and the beauty of it is that no j
possible harm can result from their j
continued use, but, on the contrary, j
great benefit.
A Buffalo physician, in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal, says: "I ad- I
vise Stuart's Charcoal Lozenges to all i
patients suffering from gas in stomach |
nnd bowels, and to clear the complex- i
ion and purify the breath, mouth and j
throat: I also believe the liver is great- i
ly benefited by the daily use of them;
they cost but twenty-five cents a box at
drug stores, and. although in some
sense a patent preparation, yet I be-
lieve I get more and better charcoal in
FJuart's Charcoal Lozenges than :in
Â«x>v of the ordinary charcoal tablets."

v not say. 'No, I did not carry
'â¢ut the little boy; I only helped carry
out the old woman'?'
To this Ruth emphatically shouted,
"1 didn't say anything of the sort."
J. F. Landis told how he found Mrs.
Snowden on the front steps of the
Weber BOOM when he arrived at the
scene of the tragedy. "She was pre
vented from entering the house by
some of the neighbors," said Landis.
"With a chair I broke the window
through which Ruth and Lukens
Jumped into the burning building."
Charles H. Dunham testified that he
saw Adolph Weber jump out from the
side window of the parlor to the lawn
while the fire was in progress.
E. H. Elder said that when he gÂ»t to
the Weber slace there was only one
person there, Mrs. Snowdf-n, who was
on the front steps of the burning house.
He said he rushed around to the back
part o* the house, where the fire was
blazing, and at the corner between the
kitchen and the dining-room he ran
into Adolph Weber. Elder said he asked
Adolph, "Is there anybody in the
SENATE ASKED
TO OUST PLATT
WASHINGTON, Feb. B.â C. W. Post
of Battle Creek, Mich., who has inter
ested himself largely in the establish
ment of a parcels post system, to-day
filed with President pro tern Frye of
the Senate a petition for the expulsion
of Senator Thomas C. Platt from the
Senate. The petition, is based on the
assertion that Platt, . as the executive
officer of the United States Express
Company, Is a party to a conspiracy to
; maintain identical rates among express
companies for articles shipped over
their lines and asserts that Platt has
stated that he will oppose all legisla
tion injuriously affecting his company's
interests.
In his petition Post charges that six
I express companies of the United States
ar^ plotting to violate the law of the
United States by monopolizing the ex
press business and fixing the rates.
He alleges "the express companies have
been collecting and are now annually
i collecting from the people of the United
i States and from the banks, trust com
[ panles and other financial institutions
I and from publishers of books and
others having frequent occasion to re
, quire the service of express companies.
, hundreds of thousands of dollars over
I and above Just compensation for the
service which they render."
Post charges that in his capacity- of
president of the United States Express
I Company, Senator- Platt is participat
ing in the conspiracy charged, and
i proceeding adds:
* ii, I* daily engaged In performing overt
acts and in the Senate 'he has used and Is
' continuing to uw his influence as a Senator
to oppoÂ«e the pelage Of money order mail bills
I on the cr-iund that if passed they would affect
Injuriously the business of said express com
pi.r.ies and reduce the amount which said
companies by reason of said combination and
conspiracy are yearly obtaining from the peo
ple of the United States over and above Just
j compensation for the services which they
rcr.der. * . ,
Post therefore asks the Senate to in
stitute an examination into the case
and that. if the charges be proved the
Senator be expelled. Explaining his
reason for proceeding against the Sena
tor, he says: 'â 'â ;, .

don't know."
"Adolpb th^n threw a bundle against
the dining-room window, breaking the
glass." said the witness, "and then b*
gan kicking the window sill in with his
left foot. 1 did not see him <jo into the
house."
The last witness of the day was Miss
Edna Fulton, daughter of Jailer J. Ful
ton. She stated that she lived near the
Weber home and that as soon as she
heard the call of "Fire" she ran over
to the Weber home. She said she found
Adolph standing on the front steps and
took hold of his arm and said, "Dolphy,
where is your mother?"
"He did not answer me," said Miss
Fulton.
Miss Fulton will be the first witness
to be called to-morrow morning at 9
o'clock.
The courtroom was crowded again to
day. About 75 per cent of those pres
ent were prominent women of Auburn.
It is exnee'ted that the murderers
pistol will be introduced in evidence
to-morrow, and there is a probability
that Mrs. Snowden will be called to the
stand.

PORTLAND, Or., Feb. B.â The Fed- |
eral Grand Jury which is investigating !
I the land fraud cases in which the !
Government contends that it has been (
defrauded of large tracts of public land '
I in this State, to-day returned three in- :
dictnients.
In one indictment A. H. Tanner, law j
partner of United States Senator John |
H. Mitchell, is alleged to have per
j jured himself in giving testimony be
1 fore the Grand Jury January 31, 1905, \
during the investigation of charges
against Mitchell. Another is against
Hamilton H. Hendricks, an officer of 1
! the Butte Creek Land and Livestock
Company, who is indicted for suborna
tion of perjury in connection with his
testimony before the Grand Jury" Janu
ary 15, 1&05.
The third indictment is against

veyor General of Oregon; George F.
Waggoner, chief clerk in the Surveyor |
General's office; David W. Kinnaird, |

Frank J. Van Winkle, notaries public.
They are indicted on a charge of con- |
sptracy to defraud the United States
Government of public lands in Central .
Oregon.
CHARGES AGAINST TANNER.
The Indictment of Judge Tanner
brings before the public with unex- ,
petted suddenness the name of a man
heretofore unconnected by rumor or
fact with the land frauds cases now
being investigated. It is alleged in the
indictment that Judge Tanner, while |
a witness before the Grand Jury on I
January 31, 1905, said that the firm of j
Mitchell & Tanner had received money j
and other compensation for work done j
for Frederick A. Kribs in expediting j
land cases through the General Land :
Office and passing them to patent, but I
that of this money Senator Mitchell ]
had not received any part for himself, j
This the Government thinks is untrue, 1
as it will attempt to prove that Sena- i
tor Mitchell did receive money, placed
to his account by Judge Tanner at the
expiration of each month.
It is further alleged that Judge Tan
ner testified that the office had not 1
kept any books of accounts showing j
what portions of such money had been !
received by Senator Mitchell, when in !
fact such accounts had been kept and j
were then in existence.
Another charge against Judge Tan- 1
1 ncr made in the indictment Is His tea- ,
1 timony in regard to a copartnership
j agreement which Is dated March 5, .
I 1901. It is alleged in each indictment !
' that this document was not written .
: and signed on March 5, 1901,Â« but that
: It was written by a clerk in the office
of Mitchell & Tanner during the recent
â¢ visit of Senator Mitchell to the city.
OTHER FRAUDS ALLEGED.
The indictment of Hamilton H. Hen
dricks, secretary and treasurer of the 1
Butte Creek Land, Livestock and Lum- i
ber Company of The Dalles, was due j
to subornation of perjury, alleged to
have been committed on January 15,
1905.
Meldrum and others are indicted for
having entered into a conspiracy on or
about April 18, 1902, to defraud the
Government, by fraudulent surveys. It
i is alleged in this indictment that the
i defendant 3 took advantage of the fact
I that there had been filed in the office
! of the General Surveyor a number of
false and forged applications purport
ing to be from bona-fide settlers that
the lands upon which they were living
be surveyed, but It is alleged that the
defendants knew that the lands were
arid and uninhabited.
A fourth indictment was returned
against George C. Brownell, amenda
tory to the Indictment returned last
week against Brownell, accusing him
of subornation of perjury.

MEN ARE NOT WANTED
IN WOMEN'S CLUBS.
FEDERATION'S LAWS *
REMAJN UNCHANGED
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 8. â To-day
was the "busy day" of the State con
vention of women's clubs. At 9:30
this morning Simpson Auditorium was
amply filled. In the assemblage sat
a solitary man. The morning session
was given over to the long discussed
proposed amendments to the constitu
tion, chief among which was that cov
ering the elimination of "women"
from the official title of the State or
ganization, which reads, "The Califor
nia Federation of Women's Clubs."
The northern delegates were solid in
opposition to this change, which was
designed to admit men into the clubs.
"The humorous part of it all is that
the men who really count don't want
to come in," said Mrs. Arthur Corn
wall of San Francisco and Mrs. Rob
ert Burdette of Los Angeles, the lat
ter being the only southern delegate
opposing the amendment.
The solitary break in the monotony
of reports was brought about by the
1 discussions, which at times rose to
the height of humor, an element con
spicuous by its absence from most
women's conventions. After an hour's
charging and countercharging, the
amendment admitting men was voted
I down â a signal victory for the hosts
i from the north.
The amendment second in import
ance was that providing for a biennial
State convention instead of an an
nual. This, too, was divided between
the northern women and the southern,
the northern delegation again winning
out.
The election of officers for the ensu
ing year, which should have been con
cluded in the forenoon, was by vote
1 extended until late to-night. The re
sults in all probability will be as fol
lows:
President Mrs. Josiah Evans Cowles; vice
president at large. Mrc Robert Devlin. Sac
ramento; recording secretary. Mrs. Frank E.
Prior, IxÂ» Angeles: corresponding secretary.
Miss ' Anna. Meeker of Pasadena; treasurer.

i Lou Angeles District. Mrs. O. C. Bryant of
I Los Angeles; San Diego District, Mrs. E. B.
Scott of San Diego.
Mrs. George Law Smith, the presid
ing officer, was tendered the nomina
1 tion for another term by the delega
\ tions from every district, but in a most
j gracious speech she declined the honor,
i throwing her weight to Mrs. Cowles.
The official announcement of the elec
tion will be made to-morrow morning.
To-night the following programme

NO MORE GAY
LIFE FOR "NAN"
Special Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK, Feb. B.â "Nan" Patter
son is keeping a diary in the Tombs,
which she expects to expand into a
neat little printed valume. She con
sented to give out the following ex
tracts from her journal to-day:
December 25 â What a sad Christmas day
this has been for me. I had hoped to be with
mominii to-iiay. How I looked forward t â¢'-.â >
i nuiment when I could throw my arm? about
her and weep out all my sorrows on her hear:.
I Poor da.l.ly was almost heartbroken, cck
"Man proposes and Ood disposes."
January 3âl3 â I know that my life after I met
, for a few years before my arrest, was
not what it should have been and that I lived
without reflection of what would bÂ« the end
of it. But I was so set about with Kay-ties,
with such a maelstrom of joyousness, that I
I never had time to come to myself -at ail and
ask myself the questions "What is thts lead
ing to?" "Will there ever be any awakening
from the dreamland happiness of it all?" It
has required this awful lesson to bring me
back from that unreal world and show me
the vanity of It all.
How much better and sweeter it is to lead
a quiet, restful life, doing good and useful
things, than to be flitting about from pleasure
to pleasure and never finding anything like
the happiness that I used to have when I
was with mother. If anybody had told me
I thÂ« day before my arrest that I was to be
locked up so mar.y months I would have pre
ferred to die. and yet 1 have been ab!e to
pass through even this. And I know that I
am better for it: for it has opened my eye*
and shown me the folly of leading a gay
thouehtless iife.

FRED E. MULHOLLAND
Owner James Curl's bay horse
Bragg, which won the six-furlong
handicap on Tuesday, picked up an
additional five pounds and captured
the $1000 mile and a sixteenth handi
cap yesterday at Oakland.
That's going- some over an old
fashioned plank road for a fresh ar
rival from Los Angeles. It's also
proof positive that we northerners
have only brotherly love and affection
for pilgrims from the southland,
here, the bees thrive on orange blos
soms and the bunko men are one
lunged Yankees. Fortunately, per
haps, for Bragg. Arcade, the favorite,
broke down on the back stretch and
was pulled up. While Michaels was
dreaming on Cloverland, with a hand
full of wraps to sell at popular prices,
Otis made a sharp move with Bragg
on the far turn, stealing the race. At
the wire he scored cleverly by two
lengths. Michaels, astride Cloverland,
after scientifically ducking the leads
and left hand jabs of Otis, did nose
out Veterano for the place.
I I\ I < HOKI> AKi; BKATEX.
Backers of favorites certainly did
enjoy themselves. The track was still
in a freckled condition and five
rhoices were bowled over.
From a bookmaker's point of view
Foxy Grandpa makes a splendid fa
vorite. Jimmy Coffey's Roman nosed
black horse had first call in the bet
ting on the first event and finished un
placed. Myrtle H. a 6 to 1 shot, with
Harrett in the saddle, went out in
front and won all the way. Dundreary,
played from 10 down to 5, ran sec
ond, two lengths before Mr. Dingle.
Maud Muller, a mare from the Miller
stable, showed to be far the best of the
eight starters in the Futurity course
run following. Holding next to last po
sition on the back stretch, Wiley
brought her through on the rail and
at the wire beat Box Elder in a drive,
Presidio cut out the early pace, and
had Willie Daly not shot the rank out
sider across the stretch a furlong from
home, in a vain search for good going, '
he would Lave won. Estraza, the 2 to
1 favorite, made a delightful showing
for a rÂ»anel or two.
Its a dry goods box full of Govern
ment bonds to a pile of second-hand
Milwaukee pressed bricks that Edro
dun can beat My Order and Alone. Still
he didn't do it. The man who ,gave
Lloyd Fountain orders to rate the
three-year-old In the third event <
should t have his badge taken up and
should be decorated with oil cans by
The ludÂ«>s.
MV OKDEK DEFEATS ALONE.
If there was one ripe, mellow spot
on the card Edrodun looked the berry,
and no wonder the crowd ate up even
jr. Fountain rated him to the
h, and My Order won easily from
Every third person met coming from
â  iddock had Beat Man for the
fifth number, and the tip was all right.
Dr. Rowell's sprinter was backed from
â  to y to 5, and downed the
r, Alta G, like breaking duck
egps with a piece of gas pipe. Alta G
80 to 1 chalked about her, and led
he dOr out four lengths for the
place. Sol Lichtenstein, the favorite,
performed disappointingly.
Should Jim Jeffries be matched to
fight Deacon Jones at Dawson City in
midwinter with icicles hanging from
the house eaves six feet long his
chances would look no brighter than
did those of Byronprdale, favoYite for
the concluding chapter. It must be
that the hand of Trainer and Owner
Jack Crane ha? lost its cunning, for
the speed the bay gelding displayed
would have made him a rank outsider
in the redlight district.
Esherin, the mount of Jakie Jones,
made all the running and then
stopped considerably the last six
teenth, defeating Erne by a neck only.
Ity finished third.

3i|H
Columbus, Ohio, May 20, 1903.
, Six years ago I had a severe attack of
Inflammatory Rheumatism. I was laid up
in bed for six mouths, and the doctors I
had did me no good. They changed med-
icines every week and nothing they pre-
scribed seemed to help me. Finally I be-
pan the use of S. S. S. My knee and elbow
joints were swollen terribly, and at one
time my joints were so swollen and pain-
ful that I could not close them when
opened. I was so bad that I could not
move knee or foot. I wasgetting discour-
aged, you may be sure, when I began S. S.
S., but as I saw it was helping me I contin-
ued it, and to-day I am a sound well man
and have never had a return of the disease.
S. S. S. purified my blood and cured me
of this severe case of Rheumatism after
everything else had failed. I have rec-
commended it to others with good re-
sults. R. H. Chapman.

flammation and pain are absorbed into the
blood and Rheumatism can never be con-
quered till these are neutralized and fil-

tacks the disease itself. It purifies and re-

Model Yachtsmen Meet.
The meeting of the San Francisco
Model Yacht Club held last night at
Unity Hall was the most enthusiastic
held in months. The principal topic
of discussion was the Dickie cup,
which will be competed for this
month. M. London, owner of the
Cricket, which won the trophy, made
a motion requiring the winners of in
termediate regattas to race off to see
which should race the cup holder.
This would mean that the race would
be between a holder and challenger.
This motion was loSt. In its place a
motion was carried which will require
the cup holder to race against two
boats instead of one. The winners of
the two intermediate regattas will be
opposed to the Dickie cup holder.

Slight Injury J^ring a
Hunting Trip Puts a Tem
porary Stop to Practice
â¦ From present appearances the inter
esting spectacle will be presented of
an opponent of Young Corbett strug
gling to get down to the required
weight. In the past it has been the
dapper New Yorker who has had to
resort to severe methods at the elev
enth hour to dispose hurriedly of his
too solid flesh.
Battling Nelson has thickened up
considerably since he fought Britt.
He is said to have weight 145 pounds
in ring costume when he commenced
training on Sunday for his meeting
I with Corbett two weeks from to-mor
j row night, when he must weigh in at
130 pounds. He has been doing hard I
road work for several days to get rid
of some of this weight and expects to
gradually work down to the required
I notch.
He will be a little backward in his
â¢ boxing practice owing to a slight in
jury to his arm during his last duck
shooting expedition. If Dick Hyland
is able to move about on his injured
foot he will do some boxing with Nel
son.
Jim Flynn, who was matched to fight
Dave Barry at San Diego, injured him
self in training and the bout has been
declared off. Another opponent will be
found for Barry.

The first of a series of three exhi

bowling , teams of the city was won
last night ;by 'the Californias, who
beat the Milwaukees two out of three j
games on the California alleys. The ,

sent this city in the tournament.
â¢. The games last . nigjit were well
played and hotly contested for a time,
although there were no sensational 1
features. Lagarde, a star from the
Milwaukee team, cast his lot with the
I Californias to make the contest a lit
tle more even and interesting. He
played a strong game, being the high ,
man on his team.
The Californias started with a rush
that surprised their opponents and i
also the â  large crowd of spectators. |
They won* the first game by a score !
of ' 910 to 890. This fast pace was j
maintained in the second contest, the ;
Californias again â¢ winning out, this
time the score standing 942 to 888.
The Milwaukee team made a des
perate effort in the final struggle and
managed to give their opponents a
snowballing. The final score was 996 I
to 956. The last game was the best j
of the night and most of the rival con- ;
testants rolled up good scores. The j
play was exciting and the steady work ;
of the Milwaukees told in the long
run.
A. W. Martin of the Milwaukee
team did the best work of the night,
scoring 236. 222 and 238 in his three
games. McGrath too"k the place of
Knowlton on the California team in ,
the last game and rolled up the good
score of 216.
To-night the Golden West team,
champions of the city for 1903 and
1904, will line up against the Milwau
kee contingent. Lagarde will play |
with the Golden Wests. A good con- '
test is looked for, as both teams are .
evenly matched. . Following is the ;

ELECT OFFICERS
Ticket as Prepared by the
Nominating Committee Is
Elected With Unanimity

Board of Directors Is Em
powered to Buy Property
Adjacent to Clubhouse
There was a large attendance of
members at the annual meeting of the
San Francisco Yacht Club held last
night in the banquet hall of the Cali
j fornia Hotel. The principal business
, was the election of officers to serve dur
| Ing the coming twelve months. There
' was a "regular ticket," as prepar
the nominating committee, and a
"members' ticket." One hundred and
eleven members voted, the "regular"
nominees winning by so large a ma
; jority that they were declared unani
mously elected. The officers for the
cum*ing>year are: W. G. Morrow, com
modore; J. M. Punnett, vice commo
dore; T^F. Kennedy. p->rt captain; VV.
I W. Wilde, secretary; VV. \V. Roberts,
treasurer; A. G. A. Mueller, rinanci&l
secretary; If. \V. Farrar. measurer.
The reports of the commodore, port
1 captain, secretary, financial secretary
' and treasurer were read and appro veil.
They showed the club to be in a satis
i factory financial condition. The new
board of directors was empower
buy more property if in its judgn&ent
the interests of the club requir- tkat
this be done to accommodate the in
creased number of members. The
' commodore, however, stated that n>
; additional property will be purchased
! without consulting the whole body of
I members.
In referenoe to the lack of harmony
! existing last season in the club it was
declared to be the sense of the m
that loyalty to the officers is essential
to the interests of the club and that
i the officers be empowered t> Mlfaii Â»
the by-laws strictly against any mem
â¢ bers who defy the regulations made
\ by tht officers or attempt la < r<Â»at â¢ i
club within a club. It was decided (q
appoint a regatta committee i<;
members, three to take charge of yacht
races and sailing regattas and th
', maining three to manage power boat
races.

BOARD THAT SHE IS UP TO REQUIREMENTS.
Admiral Whiting Says She Proved Herself a Good Ship
Sailing ol Big Liner Korea
Postponed Until Next
Wednesday.
fiM Doited States battleship Ohio,
:.opan. returned yesterday
from hor laaÂ« trial trip. The trial
. resulted In her being ac
cepted by the Navy Department took
place long ago and the big fighting
,ne has been in commission for
some time. 1 trial was for
the purpose of giving every part of
the battleship and all her equipment
a thorough, practical 6ea test. Upon
the report made by the trial board de
pends the payment to the Union Iron
V.orks of the last installment of th<Â»
cost of construction. According to
.Admiral Whiting, president of the
board, the Ohio proved herself a
good ship, and although the official
report must be In the hands of the
Navy Department before It ie made
public, there 16 every reason to believe
that H will be favorable.
The trip occupied several days. The
"8 were submitted to all sorts of
herok strains and the steering gear
1 In Intricate evolutions. Barges,
cutters, steam launches and life rafts
*ere launched and made to show their
Quality. Each bit of gear and auxil
iary machinery tvas tested in the tusk
for which it had been constructed.
Big guns and iittle guns were fired
end all in all the Ohio was mas" to
prove that she could do everything
called for In the specifications under
I 1 fhe was built.
Instead of returning to her ar.chÂ»r
ff the Union Iron Works the
dropped anchor yesterday off
Ked Rock, where a general inspection
of the crew was held. The battleship
. leared for action. Then blue
â¢ 's and marines left the ship in
landing parties. But they did not
laud anywhere. After rowing a few
hundred f^et away from the Ohio the
men rested on their oars until re
called to the gangway.
Ahnut I o'clock Admiral Whiting"s
nld him that he was due
*oor I rba Buena dinner table.
so he tvafted a wireless order and the
as dispatched from the
g station to bring the admiral
(.ap in Panama Service.
Owir.g to thÂ» detention on the Central Amer
ican Coast of the liner Newport there will b;

oxve- cf the largest en record, and It was on
account of the unexpected mount ready for

Korea Will Take Bic Cargo.
Owir.g to the discovery til a crack in her
Ficrn frame the liner Korea will not get off
iLe drydock until to-iiaj". A 6iraUar but more
*..rious Saw was found in the liner Siberia
end that vessel was out of commission foi
mary weeks. In the Korea's case a patch.

ORDER BRIDGES
TO BE REPAIRED
The Supervisors' Street Committee
yesterday requested the Board of
Works to furnish an estimate of the ]
cost of painting and making repairs on
the Fourth and Sixth street bridges.
John Karnett, an expert employed by
the committee, filed a report that the
heavy traffic over the bridges would
result in a serious accident and the
committee requested the United Rail
roads not to allow more than two cars
on the Fourth street bridge at the
same time. Barnett's report says:
"Something must be done soon to
prevent the overloading and overcrowd
ing of these . bridges, which may cause
a serious accident that might be very
expensive. It is not unusual to see I
four of the street cars loaded to their 1
full capacity and heavily loaded drays
on the Fourth street bridge at times
after it has been closed and again
closed. The iron work should be paint
ed every two years to prevent corro
sion."
Tirey L. Ford, attorney of the United
Railroads, appeared before the com
mittee in answer to the complaints that
the corporation refuses to tear up
tracks, the franchises of which have
been forfeited owing to non-usÂ«. Ford
agreed to file a written statement re
garding the complaints.
The committee dÂ°clded to pay no
attention to the communication of E.
F. Troy demanding that the curve
track at Post and Kearny streets re
cently laid by the United Railroads be
torn up forthwith until he had couched
the missive in more temperate lan
guage. The committee stated that the
Board of Supervisors has no strong
men able to rip up the rails and could
not delegate its clerks to do it.
The committee referred the petition
of the direct-line telephone com
pany for permission to erect overhead
wires in districts outside of the under
ground districts and underground wires

CLUNIE RECALLS
THREAT TO KILL
Bridgford Hetorts That He
Would Not Harm an
Enemy With a Pistol
AKGOIENTX ABE BEGUN
Executors Charged With Em
bezzlement Because They
Paid Fees of Attorneys
The Clunie-Briclgford-White contro- j
versy, arising out of the objections of j
Andrew J. Clunie to the account of his ,
co-executors in " the Thomas J. Clunie I
estate, reached the argumentative !
stage yesterday, and this afternoon,
after E. A. Bridgford has presented his
views to the court arid Andrew Ciunie 1
has answered them, the conflict will be
.taken under submission by Judge Cof
fey, without reference. to the personal
bitterness which has surcharged the
proceedings. â¢
A final* fling at -the' sensational was
had in the following dialogue, when
Clunie was on the stand yesterday and
Bridgford the examiner.
Bridgford â Why have you teen constantly re-
I ferrinsr to that Harcourt note in this proceeding
since I told you it was paid?
Clunie â Because I thought you were . guilty
of perjury in hating left White's collateral
â  note out of the account. An.l - I am going to
] refer; to It again" in my argument. 1 am under
' oath now.
Bridgfordâ And you are lying under oath.
: Judge Coffey (to Clunie) â You are not under
oath to Impute a crime. Leave out this "guilty
of perjury" from your testimony. You may
say what you please in an argument.
Bridgfordâ You'll never . ay it outside of
this court.
Clunie (deprecatingly) â Oh, you've threat
ened to kill me two or three times. Judge.
Bridgford â I'll never harm you that way.
Clunie â Well, you can't harm me any other
way. because. I am watching you.
So much for that and no blood was
shed..
When Clunie took the stand in his
own behalf he explained many of the
matters contained in his objections to
the account. He had, he said, never
consented .to the payment of $2500 to
Bridgford as an advancement on his
executor's commission, and when he
discussed the matter with him Bridg
ford "used foul language" and ordered
him out of the office, "but I didn't go,"
said Clunie, "because it wasn't his
office; he didn't pay a cent for it."
i After Clunie's testimony was taken
both sides rested and then Clunie ob
jected to having the report of Ac
countant Knapp, certifying to the cor
rectness of the executor's books, be
come a part of the records in the case.
Judge Coffey said the report had no
legal value.
Then Clunie be^an his argument, de
claring that the executors had misap
propriated $10,000 of the estate's funds
In paying attorneys whose services
were not needed. He asserted that
they were therefore guilty of embezzle
ment under the. section of the Criminal
Code relating to the trust of executors.
He contended that if the services of
Judge Grant and Walter Robinson
could be charged for the court would
not have allowed more than $3000, and
he relied on that provision of General
Clunie's will that one of the three ex
ecutors, all lawyers, should choose one
of their own number as attorney for
the estate.
When Judge Grant answered the ar
gument he , made â  the point that the
provision of the will that one of the
three "may be designated as attor
ney" was not mandatory, but merely
to be construed that if one of the three
acted he should have extra compensa
tion for the service. The services by
himself and Robinson, he said, had
been rendered in good faith and the
money had been paid. If it was not
allowed by the court the executors
could be held personally responsible.
Judge' Coffey intimated that attor
neys often drew wills in their own in
terest and that the court could not ut
terly ignore the provision of Clunie's
will. It either meant" something or
nothing regarding the employment of
one of the three executors as attorney.
Grant, for himself. wanted to say
that he had been charged with helping
"to loot the estate"; that it was a se
rious charge, gravely made, and if true
ought to be followed by proceedings
for his disbarment from practice. "If
false," said he, "it constitutes criminal
libel."
"I am willing to answer the libel,"
interjected Clunie.
"You will be called upon to answer,"
said Burrell White. '

HAZEN MISSES
SIX MAIDENS
Secret Service Man Kept in
the Dark as to Revelations
.Made by the Chinese Slaves
* â  Â«
HE BEPOKTS TO WILKIF
Blame Is Attached to the
Commissioner General, to
J. Dunn and Hart North
The Appraiser's building is fairly
ouzzing with the Lee Toy scandal, and
the details of the criminal negligence
jf the Chinese Bureau people here and
in St. Louis and of the office of the
Crated States Commissioner General of
Immigration are coming to light. It
appears that six Chinese slaves whm
had been sent to the Chinese village at
the St. Louis Exposition had confessed
as early as October 25 to Inspector
James R. Dunn that Lee Toy's agent
In China had purchased them for an
immoral purpose and that Lee Toy had
coached them as to what they should
say to the immigrant authorities on
their arrival at this port. The prices
paid for them as related by the slaves
are as follows: H. Sun Won. $1500 Mex
ican; Fong Ngan, $1400 Mexican; Ng
M<fw San. $600 Mexican: Loo Ngung,
$1000 Mexican; Can Gin Vow, $500 Mex
ican, and Ho Hung, $900 Mexican.
Mr. Dunn reported these confessions
to his superior officers in Washington
and recommended the deportation of
the women. Neither he nor his supe
riors ever thought of notifying District
Attorney Woodworth or Mr. North of
the revelations made by the women un
til November 19, three weeks later,
when Dunn wrote to North informing:
him that the women had confessed and
that their confessions implicated Lee
Toy and others. This latter was re
ceived by North on November 21 At
that time the six women were in cus
tody here, and would have been de
tained as witnesses in the Lee Toy-Da
Silva trial had Mr. Woodworth been
notified of any of these facts. North
deported the women mi November 2t>,
and on December 5 sent to Mr. Wood
worth the duplicate copies of the con
fessions.
'Woodworth came to my office on De
cember 5," said United States Secret
Service Agent Hazen yesterday, "hand
ed me the confessions and asked. What
3o you think of that?' He informed me
that they had been handed to him by
Mr. North's messenger without any
letter of transmission explaining their
history. I reported the case at once to
Mr. Wilkle. chief of the United States
secret service at Washington. The
women could have been intercepted at
Honolulu had we been notified and
brought back here to testify on the
trial of Lee Toy and Da Silva-. but they
were out nine days at that time and
had passed Honolulu. I have no doubt
that with their testimony Lee Toy at
least could have been convicted."
Mr. Woodworth said yesterday that a
conviction could have been had if the
svorr.en had been kept here to testify.
"The written confessions would not
be admitted in court," he added. "It
would be necessary for the women
themselves to testify."
F7I.E ANSWER TO THE
SUIT BROUGHT BY RAYL
Defendants Allege That Plaintiff Was
Beaten By Friends of Girl
He Attacked.
Frank G. Hancock. Roland Murdock
md John Daley filed through their
ittorney, Frank Costello, an answer
yesterday in the suit brought against
;hem by Garfleld Ravi in the Justice's
rourt to recover $299 damages for an
illeged assault. The answer puts in
i complete denial that the defendants
aeat or maimed Rayl and also makes
illegations against Jiis moral char
icter, claiming that he poses as a
pugilist and is known as '"Kid" Rayl.
rhey also allege on information and
belief that Rayl attempted an attack
:>r. two occasions upon Terese Mc-
Htnry, once at the Edgemere Hotel
md another time in a law office. The
iefendants further state that they are
informed that Rayl did receive a beat
ing at the hands of the friends of
rerese McHenry for his attempted at
tack upon her.

ADDRESS ALL, COMMUNICATIONS TO
SOWS McNAUGHT Manager
PUBLICATION OFFICE third AKD MARKET STREETS. saw FRANCISCO
THURSDAY FEBRUARY 9, 1905
THE warfare goes on in the House at Washington between vari
ous bills drawn to cover some phase of the railroad problem, as
it is presented by the President. Mr. Hearst is frantically striv
ing to keep in the glare of publicity by pasting his name on the
ideas of other men, and is just now tilting at John Sharp Williams,
the Democratic leader, and denying that he, as a Democrat, is
i hat the boys call "the true Peruvian doughnut." Through all
the confusion the vision of discernment can see an outcome as sat
isfactory to the country as it ought to be to the railroads.
Railroad law, providing a maze of regulation, of permissions
and prohibitions, has been built up during the last thirty years by
rule of thumb. Part of it is Federal legislation and part of it is by
the States. It is complex and confusing, often" contradictory and
frequently unreasonable. Its peculiar features are due to the fact
that, for the most part, it is in response to popular feeling against
some feature of transportation policy. To this feeling the politicians
have responded with excessive alacrity, until a codification of Ameri
can statutes on railroads would present a complex and various sys
tem which, if always obeyed by the corporations, would prove a
hindrance rather than a help 10 trade. All of this is not to be won
dered at. Legislation had for the purpose of punishment or revenge,
or enacted in the frenzy of passion, is always hectic and often in
effective.
It is evident that these features are appreciated by the President,
and therefore he desires to approach a reform from a different direc
tion entire!}'. He invites the railroads to co-operate in the simpli
fying of this mass of statutes. He evidently desires that legislation
â¢-hall <le?ert the turns and angles and the labyrinth heretofore its
characteristics, and that the matter shall be taken up as a business
concern of vast importance to the people and to the owners of rail
road property. He evidently desires that Federal railroad law shall
am, consistent and uninvolved, and that it shall affirm all rights
and inflict no wrongs.
It is equally evident that the railroad people, arguing from past
experience, believe that this cannot be done. Among their reasons
for this belief may be put the simian antics of Mr. Hearst, who is
<i<~>inÂ£ more to hinder what he pretends to help than any other man in
:he United States. All business men fear any legislation on any
subject that impinges upon business, made in the destructive spirit
which he promotes.
The spirit of the President is entirely different. It is that of
an economic philosopher who is aware oi the necessity for legislation.
and proposes it free from passion and prejudice. Now, if Congress
proceed in that spirit, and enact a body of railroad and transporta
tion law, following the principles set forth in the clearest judicial
decisions, what is now confusion will become consistent, and what is
crooked and conflicting will be made Straight. If this be done, such
rm in the spirit and text of the law will satisfy the country
and should satisfy the railroads, as a substitute for the chaos of
statutes through which they flounder.
If ihe Federal Government set the example, the States will fol
low it in simpler laws regulating their domestic transportation, and
the law departments of railroad companies will soon appreciate the
nee between laws that are the fruit of prejudice and passion,
and those that are the result of business-like deliberation. If we
properly appreciate the situation, the most expert railroad talent in
' 1 co-operate in this endeavor to strengthen the law
by purging it of complexity. It is clearly their right to so co-operate,
man would ask them to sit in council with Mr. Hearst,

The situation is now apt and favorable for a settlement. The
people will accept reasonable results at the hands of this Congress
or the next. If such results do not appear, the question will go to
the people and demagogues will appear with congested necks, shout

â o-operation is reasonable and right, and to disregard
it and fight him may set the storm signals riving from Hoosac tun
nel to the wharves of Astoria.
GALLANTRY, NOT JUSTICE.
HOW quickly is The Call justified in its contention that women
are too good to be hanged. Two unfortunate women who
killed their husbands and were condemned to the gallows by
hard-hearted juries are standing in its shadow. One of these is in
Vermont and the other in Pennsylvania. As their day of doom ap
proaches, there occurs one of the most remarkable and creditable out
bursts of mercy and gallantry the world has ever seen, demanding
that they be saved from the rope. We hope it will succeed. It is un
civilized to hang a woman. In Vermont the hard-fisted Yankee
Sheriff has served notice on the Governor that he will not be hang
man to a woman. His deputies also decline to do a legal duty, in the
performance of which the image of their mothers will rise in rebuke.
Sinful these women were, yes. But when the circumstances of
their training and treatment and of their station in life, to which
fate compelled them, are taken into consideration, who shall say
that part of their sin and weakness is not on the conscience of society
-elf? Let any sensitive eye traverse the rough path they trod to
the horrid moment of their crime, and note the points at which a
wise and helping hand that never came would have changed their
whole destiny. It is easily deniable that they should be held to
the same accountability as men. Men go wrong from choice ;
women from necessity.
In connection with this matter we beg most respectfully to ask
3 the Susan B. Anthony Club of San Francisco is in favor of hanging
hese two forlorn and uphappy women? Justice demands it, but
mercy and gallantry say no.
SO far have the efforts at making efficient the use of oil for roads
proceeded that the matter may be said to have passed the ex
perimental stage and attained practicality. In the recently
issued biennial report of State Commissioner of Highways Ellery
attention is given the progress made in the making of solid road
beds by oil application and suggestions offered for the perfection
of present methods.
Commissioner Ellery finds that oil used simply as the settler
of dust and applied to a road previously unprepared by foundations
produces no satisfactory results. If an oiled road is to be in any
measure satisfactory efficient rolling of the roadbed and provision
for the draining of water should be made previous to the applica
tion of the crude. Provided the oil used contains a sufficient
amount of asphalt, the gradual setting of this solid material in con
tact with the hard, drained surface of the roadbed will produce a
highway to all intents and purposes as perfect as a macadamized city
street. In the south great progress in the making of oiled roads
has already been made, and the Commissioner expresses it as his
opinion that throughout the whole State attention should be given
this practical method of good road-making.
RAILROAD LAW.
OILED ROADS.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 9. 1905.
THE GOLDEN CALF
THE girl had stood silently at
the window for some few min
utes watching the long slanting
lines of rain that came driving
down from the dun-colored
clouds in the sky, with every savage
gust of wind the dead leaves came
swirling down and the giant elms in
the street tossed their branches in
wild distress.
The strife of the storm without
seemed typical of the stormy combat
that was going on In her heart â a
warfare between her Inclinations and
the dictates of sane, calm Judgment.
The man sat quietly by the library
table, his keen eyes fixed steadfastly
on the girl and a grim expression,
half expectancy and half iron deter
mination, curving the corners of his
mouth.
The girl turned from the window,
and from her eyes he learned the con
flict was not yet brought to an issue.
She spoke slowly, with something like
appeal in her tones.
"Must you go to-morrow?" she
asked.
"To-morrow," he replied inexor
ably.
"And â and you want an answer be
fore you go?"
"An affirmative answer," he correct
ed smilingly.
"Don't go out there, Tom," she said
with a queer little quaver in her voice.
"I must," he said simply. "It's a
magnificent field. It offers everything
I want â money, power and position."
His eyes burned as he spoke, but they
softened as they rested on the girl's
face. "Think what it means," he fin
ished.
"You're sure you want all this â the
money and the power?" she asked.
"Absolutely certain," said he cheer
fully.
Blm turned to the window again
and watched the leaves driven hither
and thither in the wind; then she
faced the man at the table with a pa
thetic smile on her lips.
"Tom, I â I â can't," she said.
He sat quite still, as if the words
had stunned him. His eyes stared
blankly at her.
"You don't love me, Helen â is that
it?" he asked very slowly.
"It's not that," she confessed.
"Don't you < have faith in my ulti
mate success?" he asked.
THE WIPE SHOULD BE A CLINGING VINE
Even if She Marries a Scrub Oak of a Man Her Love Has a
Mission to Perform.
SOME college girls were talking
over Eugene Field's fable of
"The Oak and the Ivy," which is
published in his "Little Book of
Profitable Tales." Said one girl:
"The story means to me my ideal of
married happiness. A man should be
like the strung oak, the woman should
h<i like the clinging ivy."
"Oh, yes," commented the cynic of
the group, "only a girl doesn't often
meet such an oak as Eugene Field de
scribes, a king of the greenwood. Most
men. nowadays, are of the scrub-oak
variety."
The second speaker, of course, got
the applause. She had said a clever
thing. . Yet she had missed entirely
the point of Field's exquisite narrative.
Or, possibly, she had deliberately dis
regarded it for ihe sake of a fling back
at man, in retaliation for that ever
li.sting anecdote of his about Eve and
the apple.
To me the story of the ivy's devo
t:on to the oak typifies the love which
a good woman gives to the man whom
she marries, if he is worthy of her.
She looks up to him, she clings to his
strength for protection, she grows in
knowledge of the world by listening
to his ambitions and to what he tells
her of the wider life that she, safe in
the sheltering haven of the home he
gives her, cannot know. And thus, as
years pass by, she becomes a part of
him. In wind and rain and sunshine
the two are one, because each is neces
sary to the other.
MORMON SATIRE ON CHRISTIANITY
A remarkable article on the Mormon
endowment ceremony in the World To-
Day for February contains passages
showing how the secret rites of the
Latter-Day Saints satirize Christianity.
For example, in a dialc-gue between
Adam and the Devil the latter has
many flings at the gentiles. Adam has
been calling on the, name of the Lord
and the Devil answers him.
Dcvil â I hear you. What is it you
want?
Adam â Who are you?
Dcvil â I am the God of this world.
Adam â Who made you the God of
this world?
Devilâ l made myself. What is it
ytru want?
Adam â I was calling on father.
Dcvil â Oh, I see you want religion.
I'll have some preachers down here
presently. (Enter preacher.)
Parson (looking around) â You have a
fine congregation here.
Dcvil â Oh, you are a preacher.
Parson â Yes.
FIRST SOUTH AFRICAN DIAMOND

death of John O'Reilly, whose name
is prominently associated with the
discovery of the first diamond in the
area now worked by the De Beers cor

O'Reilly came Into possession of a
"beautiful pebble" picked up by the

of the Orange River. The child took

Then great trouble comes. The

Parson â Why, certainly. No man can
preach the gospel unless he has been to
college and studied the dead languages.
Devilâ lf you will preach to this con
gregation, and convert them, mind you,

Parsonâ That is very little, but I will

We will sing on page 256. "When I Can
Read My Title Clear." (All sing.)
Parson (to Adam) â Do you believe in
that great spirit who dwells beyond the
bounds of time and space and sits on
the top of a topless throne, who is so
great that he fills the universe, yet is
so small that he can dwell in your
heart, whose center is everywhere and
circumference nowhere?
Adamâ l don't believe a word of it.
Parsonâ l am sorry for you. But per
haps you believe in hell, that great bot
tomless pit which is full of fire and
brimstone, into which the wicked are
his mother, who drew a neighbor's
attention to its sparkling qualities.
The neighbor, another farmer,
showed the gem to Mr. O'Reilly, who
at that time was a traveling trader,
and he, shrewdly suspecting its real
character, undertook to get it valued.
Several people in various parts of
Cape Colony to whom he showed the
stone ridiculed the notion that it had
any extraordinary value. Finally
Lorenzo Boyes, the Civil Commis
sioner of Colesburg, pronounced it to
be a diamond, and his opinion was
You are bound to go on and on and on.
You speak of money; you have an
amount now that many a man would
envy. You talk of power; It Is yours
here. And yet it isn't enough. You
must go to other fields with greater
opportunities. Tom, dear, it's hard to
say, and yet I must; you bow down to
the golden calf and you always will. In
the years to come you would think
more and more of your ambitions, and
correspondingly less of me. That la
why I say I can't marry you."
She sat down opposite him and rest
ed her head on her hand. He rose quiet
ly and came round to her side of the
table. He stood beside her, his big
hand resting very gently on' her brown
head.
"Did you ever stop to think why I
fought so hard to rise?" he said.
She shook her head.
"It was because of you," said he.
"Every ambition, every motive I owe to
you. If I conquered the world and laid
It at your feet I should still feel un
worthy of you."
He stood silently looking down at her.
The wind whistled shrilly and the rain
beat sharply against the window panes.
She felt the hand on her head tremble.
"Helen, do you love me as I am?" he
asked.
"Yes," she said.
"Would you love me if I were penni
less?"
She looked up at him- with a smile
that transformed her face.
"How I sfenild love you then!" she
said simply.
He caught one of her hands in his
and fell to laughing softly.
"My ambitions are really of your mak
ing. Do with them as you will," said
he.
"You mean you won't go out there?"
she asked.
"I mean I have ceased to worship the
golden calf you mentioned." said he.
"No man can serve two masters, and I
think I make a wise choice in serving
you," he laughed.
He bent over her and saw there were
tears in her eyes.
"What on earth are you crying for,
Helen?" he asked.
"Well, I have a sneaking sympathy
for the golden calf," she said, smiling
happily through her tears.

whelming fury. The great oaks maj
esty is riven. In agony of pain and
broken pride he cries: "I> cannot

Now comes the sweetness of the
story. What went, before is common
place beside it. From this point on j
we have revealed to us the beauty of
the ivy, which as I- said before, is like ;
the- beauty of a good wife's love. The j
ivy nursed the oak back into strength j
and hope. She bound his wounds up
first, Ad then she comforted him by
telling him the simple, humble things
which she had learned by living close j
to earth; but she told them to him in j
the language of his own ambitions, j
that he had taught her. And she j
ccvered up his scars and shielded him
with the strength of her beauty: and
straight he stood and looked toward
God; and no one passing by would j
ever guess that once his kingly heart
was riven.
Suppose a woman marries a scrub
oak of a man. Why should the story
be very different? Probably she is not
a vine that could grow to the height of
a king of the greenwood. Nature, if
left to herself, arranges these things
suitably. Anyhow, her wifely love has
Its mission. She, too, should listen to
her lord's ambitions, and learn from
them â should cling to him â for at her
best she is only a yine â should give
him dear companionship in return for
his protection; and she must grow to
his height whatever it is, and whatever
vitality she has left over she can best
use in making the beauty of her life a
glory added to his own.

ago. He was the owner of realty which â 
appreciated in value when Golden Gate j
Park was opened, and he participated |
in the dedication of the public pleasure '

acquirement of fortune and her later j
pleasures in the delights of the park i

are bequests of $25,000 for Margaret To-

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, THURSDAY. FEBRUARY 9. 1905.
FUGITIVES MAY
BE EXTRADITED
Government Wins Point in
the Gaynor-Greene Case
in British Privy Council
KEAKKESTS TO FOLLOW
Efforts to Be Kenewed to
Bring 3len From Canada to
Stand Trial in Georgia
LONDON, Feb. B.â The Privy Council
rendered its decision this morning in
the Greene-Gaynor case in favor of the
American Government. The Council
reversed the two judgments of Justice
Caron of Quebec, rendered on August
13, 1902, and ordered the respondents to
pay the costs of the appeal. The Coun
cil's decision caustically criticizes the
action of Justice Caron in releasing
Breene and Gay nor.
The decision leaves Greene and Gay
nor under remand as before Justice
(jaron intervened.
WASHINGTON, Feb. B.â Although
sufficient detail is not before the law
officers here to warrant a final opinion
â as to the effect-of the Privy Council's
decision in the Gaynor-Greene case, the
present understanding is that it will
result in the immediate rearrest of
Gaynor and Greene, who are now at
large in Quebec under surveillance of
Washington secret service officers.
If the renewed application for extra
dition is granted the men will be taken
to Atlanta, Ga., for trial on charges
growing out of the misappropriation of
Government money in connection with
the river and harbor works on the
Georgia coast under the administration
of Captain Oberlin M. Carter.
The officials feel that their hands
have been much strengthened in deal
ing with extradition cases between the
United States and Canada by this pai
ticular decision, indicating, as it does,
a disposition* on the part of the British
authorities to waive trifling technicali
ties and resolve any doubts in favor of
the spirit of the extradition treaty
rather than its letter.
MONTREAL, Feb. B.â Donald Master,
K. C. counsel for the United States in
the Gaynor-Greene case, refused to
discuss the next steps to be taken.
Judge La Fontaine. Extradition Com
missioner, before whom the case was
being heard on Its merits at the time
of the habeas corpus proceedings, said
to-day:
Unless something unforeseen occurs, the
Sheriff of Quebec will now have to deliver the
prisoners to Governor Vallee at the Montreal
Jail and they will then be brought before me
and the regular trial, halted by the writ of ha
beas corpus, will be recommenced. I sha'.l
then upon the evidence submitted decide
whether or not there are sufficient grouns for
extraditing the accused.
John F. Gaynor and Beniamin E.
Greene were indicted in Savannah,
Ga.. December 8, 1899, charged with
embezzlement and defrauding the
United States Government, t jj ther
with Captain Oberlin M. Carter, in the
performance of Government contracts
for the improvement of the Savannah
River and other river and harbor work
in that district, the illicit profits being
estimated at $2,000,000.
Gaynor and Greene were arrested in
New York. 3*hey contested extradition
to Georgia, and when the United States
Commissioner decided that they must
go to that State and plead to the in
dictments they fled to Canada. They
had been at liberty on $40,000 bail each,
and this was forfeited. Efforts to ex
tradite Gaynor and Greene from Mont
real were progressing favorably when
Gaynor and Greene went back to Que
bec. A question arose as to whether
they could be brought back, and detec
tives kidnaped them and took them to '
Montreal.
There was a big legal fight over this
action and a Quebec Judge issued a
writ of habeas corpus which was
served on the jailer at Montreal, who
delivered up the prisoners without au
thority -from the extradition tribunal
and permitted them to be rushed back
to Quebec.
Efforts to quash the writ of habeas
corpus under which ..hey had been re
turned were denied by Justice Caron.
After a long legal controversy Gaynor
and Greene obtained their liberty
within the. limits of the province of
Quebec. The United States Govern
ment then appealed to the Privy Coun
cil of England, the highest court in
that country.

BENEFICIARIES GRATEFUL.
When told by a representative of
The Call regarding Mrs. Sharp's be
quest to the Salvation Army, Colonel
George French^ the head of the or
ganization in San Francisco, was sur
prised. He expressed deep sorrow at
the death of Mrs. Sharp though he
had no recollection of ever having seen
the charitable woman. The colonel
said that such news as a gift of $25,000
to the Salvation Array for the purpose
of relieving the poor of the city came
as an offset, to some bitter disappoint
ments he had met with throughout the
day.
Mrs. Richard Brown, the financial
secretary of the King's Daughters'
Home, Sl7 Francisco street, also ex
pressed sincere regret at the news of
the death of Mrs. Sharp. Mrs. Brown
had only met Mrs. Sharp once and
then it was as far baok as five years
apro. The bequest to the institution of
$25,000 was a great surprise to Mrs. I
Brown. The King's Daughters' Home
is devoted to caring for incurable

STOLEN BOND
IS RECOVERED
Taken in the Famous Man
hattan Bank Robbery 27
Years Ago, It Reappears
NEW YORK, Feb. B.â Dr. Lewis O.
Wilcoxson is under arrest here, to
gether with Joseph A. Taylor, of I
White Plains, N. V., and James A.
Smith, of this city, in connection with
the recovery of a $10,000 United States
Government bond stolen from the Man
hattan Savings Institution in 1878. The
three prisoners claim to be capitalists
and promoters.
The complaint on which they were
arrested served also as the basis for a
warrant for the arrest of one Samuel
Warren Miller. Secret Service detec
tives, who are busy unraveling the case,
Bay they are in doubt whether
Miller is a real or a mythical person- !
age. The only evidence that such a
man exists rests upon the fact that his
name, written out in full, appears upon
the bond in the place where the name
of the Manhattan Savings Institution
should appear, and the additional fact
that Dr. Wilcoxson describes Miller as
the man from whose hands the bond
came into his possession as the result
of a business transaction.
When Deputy Assistant United States
Treasurer G. W. Malor received the
bond from a bank messenger in the
course of business, he instantly recog
nized it because of the number and
called Captain Flynn of the Secret Ser
vice. They examined the paper and
found no disfigurement except in the
perfect substitution of one name for
the other. The name Samuel Warren
Miller appeared to have been written
many years ago.
Captain Flynn went to the Aetna
Bank and there found James A. Smith,
who had presented the bond and who
had been asked to wait while it was
referred to the treasury officials.
Smith said Joseph A. Taylor, a friend,
brought him into contact with Dr. Wil
coxson and that the latter had
authorized him to negotiate a loan
for $9500 with the bond as collateral.
Smith and Taylor were to receive a
commission.
On the back of the security it ap- '
peared that Miller had on Monday
morning transferred the bond to Wil
coxson in the presence of President
Moyer of the Shoe and Leather Na
tional Bank as required by law.
The recovery of the bond recalft the !
robbery, twenty-seven years ago, of
the Manhattan Bank, one of the richest
hauls ever made in America. The
burglars secured nearly $3,000,000 in
cash and negotiable seenrities.
Troubles are like rainbows â if you
go toward them they disappear.

JOINT SESSION BRIEF
Only Fifty 3linutes Are Con
sumed in Disposing of
the Electoral Keturns
WASHINGTON. Feb. 8. â Although
the result of the Presidential election
was known early on the evening of
November 8, it was not until to-day,
when the Senate and House met in
joint session, that Theodore Roose
velt and Charles W. Fairbanks were
officially declared to be elected
President and Vice President, respec
tively, for four years beginning March
4, 1905. This function of Congress
attracted to the House chamber,
where the electoral vote was can
vassed, an Immense gathering, promi
nent among the audience being Mrs.
Roosevelt, Miss Alice Roosevelt, the
President's sister, Mrs. Cowles, and
Mrs. Charles W. Fairbanks, wife of
the Vice Presldeut-elect. President
Pro Tern Frye of the Senate presided
and delivered the announcement of
the result of the count, which
showed that President Roosevelt and
Mr. Fairbanks received 336 electoral
votes and Parker and Davis 140. The
whole proceeding consumed exactly
fifty minutes, thereby establishing a
new record in counting the electoral
vote.
The States were called in alphabet
ical order. The first mention of Pres
ident Roosevelt's name came when the
vote of California was announced. It
was the signal for applause from the
Republican side.

SECRETARY METCATiF MAKES
DECISION FAVORING BANK
Clerks' Duties Declared to Partake
of the Nature of Some I^eamcd
Professions.
The lengthy opinion of Secretary j
Metcalf of the Department of Com- j
meree and Labor, allowing Kwanlchi J
Miyamoto to land, notwithstanding ;
the adverse recommendation of
United States Immigrant Commis
sioner North, was received by the
latter yesterdny. Miyamoto was a
clerk in the Yokohama Specie Bank
at Yokohama and came here under !
contract to take a clerkship in the j
New York branch of that institution. â 
Bank clerks having been denied land
ing heretofore as contract laborers.
Mr. North recommended his deporta- i
tion. Miyamoto took an appeal, and :
the appeal being sustained he was
allowed to proceed to New York.
Secretary Metcalf's decision holds
that the Yokohama Specie Bank is
different from all other banks and its
clerks different from all other bank
clerks; that while other bank clerks
coming hither under contract are
contract laborers, the clerks of the
Yokohama Specie Bank are profes
sional gentlemen. That settles the
moot Question.
DUKE CHARGES
INTIMIDATION
Police Captain Alleges That
Editor Tried to Force 31.
O'Keefe to Commit Perjury
COMMISSIONERS MEET
Regular Weekly Hearing Ke
sults in Clearing Calen
dar of Eoutine Business
.Last night, before the Police Com
i missioners, Police Captain Duke
I charged I. W. Parsons of 222 Montgum
: cry avenue, editor of the North End
; Review, with felony, consisting in
lan attempt to intimidate a witness.
} The complaint to which Duke's signa
ture is affixed recites an alleged hap
pening in the Hall of Justice shortly
after Michael O'Keefe was arrested
charged with stabbing the captain.
The complaint alleges that while
O'Keefe was in a cell Parsons appeared
' and, showing him his card, asked If he
! had not attacked Captain Duke.
j O'Keefe said that he had and asked for
j the card, but it was refused by the vls
i itor. Then, it is said, Parsons made
: the proposition to O'Keefe that if he
j would swear that his sister was alone
! in the room with Duke he would hire a
I lawyer and have him freed.
O'Keefe indignantly refused to ac
' cede to the request and the complaint
: alleges that Parsons left after caution-
I ing O'Keefe not to mention his visit.
Later an article attacking Duke ap
peared in the North End Review and
â  this caused O'Keefe to mention the
; matter to Duke.
Later O'Keefe identified Parsons as
j the man who visited him and Parsons
admitted the visit, but said that
I O'Keefe had misunderstood and mis
i represented the conversation. Captain
! Duke assigns as the cause for Parsons'
animosity that he succeeded in stop
ping a crap game formerly conducted
by Parsons in the Oregon House. As
Parsons runs a saloon the Commission
, ers cited him to appear to show cause
why his license should not be revoked.
Acting as a pension board, the Com
missioners granted the request for a
, pension of the widow of Detective Abe
' Anthony, who* was injured while pre
; venting the escape of a prisoner.
Twenty-four restaurant keepers, five
! hack drivers and saloon men applied
; for licenses.
Charles L. Dall was granted a license
to conduct a saloon at 317 Sixth street.
i formerly owned by R. R. Miller, and
was given the privilege to remove to
1938 Great Highway. This provision
, practically carried with it the licensing
of a saloon on the Ocean boulevard and
Commissioner Reagan voted In the
negative. The case of John A. Carl
son and "Will Burgis went over for a
: week. The commission then adjourned
! to to-morrow night at 7:30 o'clock.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Feb. B.â The stock market
had Its rtrong point* to-day, Â»â  filch acted
with ruetalnitur effect on the general list. in
â¢'-cordance with the precedent of several days
previous. The movement In Reading and On
tario and Western was carried over from yes
tt-raay. But, on the other hand, yesterday's
buoyant ris* In Norfolk and Western, Atchi
eon. Tennessee Cccl and some others showed
evidence of having run out and halted
or turned back to-day. There were news
developments of interest and of Importance,
but price movements showed no direct reflec
tion of theÂ«; Influences. Yesterday's rise m
Atchison. unexplained at the time, found the
motive in the election today of H. H. Rog- !
ers and H. C. Frick to the board of direct
ors. Wail street -.gards this is confirmation
of a report now 6evc-r_l monihs old of an ex
tension of hidings In this prcjierty in the In
terest of Uh.on Pacific domination in the
transcontinental railroad field. This particu
lar ~i>ort had long dropped out of eight, and
had not figured In the recent busy rumors of
railroad dtale. It U thÂ« first really substan
tial evidence, however, that has come to the
public to corroborate the belief that the par- ;
Ucular parti' of financiers thus represented j
Is reaching cut for extension and consolida- ]
tlon of control in the railroad field. To this
extent it served to revive confidence In some
depree Sa other deal rumors which have been
infiuemiaJ in thÂ« speculation. Union Pacific !
Â«w the only one of the stocks Immediately â¢
concerned to "be much affected to-day, Atchison,
lttelf, as has been SMI being subjected
to realizing. The rise in Reading and Ontario
and Western hud some explanation in the. high
rate of January production of anthracte and
in the report* ot reduction of stocks on hand
â¢n h:ch is resulting from winter obstacles. But
other members of thÂ« group of coalers were
unresponsive, notable the Erie*. The easier
ton*? in the exchange market and the check
to ttoe export of pold to France had some ef
ifcct <n speculative sentiment, alâOURh large
engager..Â«2vs for Cuba and South America
sÂ«-rved as a partly offsetting Influence. For
eign discount markets were inclined to be
easier, and the pricÂ« of gold was lower In
London, while sterling exchange advanced In
l'arls. Peace rumors continued to affect the
fcrejâ j markets, end there was some buying
h^-Â« of stocks for foreign account. Reports of
further purchase* of pig Iron by the United
Suites Pieel 1 ration was regarded as a ,
s*.ilfJ actory - Index of be Induetrl&l situation.
but United Stat^ Eteel stocks were not af
* rÂ«vtetJ. There were many advances, however, I
Â«l other points' eC the industrial li6t_ There !
Â»aÂ« toaw t*lk that Xew York. New Haven '
and "Hartford was extending ; Its hlodlngs of '
Ontario ar.d Western, and this wa# held to ac i
count fcr the buoyant upshoot In that stock. I
which served to support the market at the !
last and rnafie the closing strong. Previous to
this the large realizing, which had Ix-en In
progress all day, had rather generally over
come the ftrrr.r.ess of the market. The large
number ot offerings of new securities, which
ie in evidence In the financial advertising from
day to day. the local closing up of under
writing syndicate* and the ready absorption
of new bonds is a factor in the prevailing
strength of conditions in the Investment mar
ket.
Bonds were firm. Total sales (par value),
$6,410,000,
United - â¢-Â« br.'.< were all unchanged on

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions. i
CHICAGO. Feb. â Dullness to the point '
where trading was almost at a standstill was
witnessed in the wheat pit to-day. Prices
throughout the- entire session showed a down
ward tendency. At the outset there was sell
ing of July by longs, who felt that the general
snowstorms throughout the winter wheat
bell would make prospects of new wheat
lin July more * reassuring. \ There was
; also Home selling of May by commis
; sion houses. Lower " prices at Liverpool â 
' had some effect on early trading. Initial quota- |
tions on May were off &@&c at $1 IBM,Â® !
1 16%. July was also down V6Â®V*c at i
$1 01%@l 01%. After July had sola oft to I
; f 1 01% the price rallied to $1 01% on buying
I of a fair line â by a arorninent commission ;
house. In sympathy May sold up to $1 16%.
The support, However, was only temporary,
the market soon becoming easy on lack of
buying. One reason for the poor demand was
the fact that the domestic situation as to ex
letlr.g supplies and general distribution aa- t
i parent'y offered little encouragement â¢to be- '
I lever* In higher prices. . The increased ar- ,
rlvale from Minneapolis and Duluth formed
; probably one of the chief causes of moderate '
| selling here during the day by houses with
"Northwestern connections. Selling developed
fair proportions late in the* session and re
.; sulted in a weak feeling. , Closing prices were ;
at $1 10 % for May and $1 00% for July.
Notwithstanding the weakness of wheat the '
! corn market held comoaratively firm. May
opened unchanged to a shade higher at '45 %c j
to -4.1 >>, V -* â¢"Â« ! * <-â  and closed at 46Â»4c.
An effort by local bear leaders to raid the
! oats market was frustrated by active buying
' by shorts and commission houses. May closed
â  &C down at 30%&;J0!-ic. i
Considering the heavy receipts of live hogs,
; the provisions market was surprisingly steady.
iAt the lose May Dork and ribs were un
> changed at $12 $24 and $ti 82V4 respectively.

WHEAT â The foreign markets were not ma
terially changed. Chicago was %c lower on
the day. ' " .
In this market futures were extremely
active, the brokers â¢ reporting 'it : the ' liveliest .
day for months. The bears hammered: the
market to such purpose that they beat prices
down 2c for May and %c for December. The
shorts are. trying to get the May option down
to where they can fill their contract*. â¢ The
cash grain 'did, not ; sympathizer, with futures
and continued well held, though the demand
was slow. The statistical position of the mar
ket Is strong, the grain being scarce all over
the State. . . .. ..

BARLEY â The bears made a raid on the
May option yesterday and drove It down 2VÂ«c.
carrying December down 2c with it. Their
opportunity for a raid presented itself in the
recent widespread rain, coupled, with the re
ported countermanding of a Russian shipment
order for about 5000 or 6000 tons. It was re- !
ported that this large line of Barley was al
ready at tidewater ready to go aboard ship,
and the throwing of It on the market naturally
depressed the situation. Whether this report
prove fully correct or not, It was accepted as
approximately bo, and certainly served its pur
pose. The trading in the pit was reported the
heaviest for months. The cash grain weak
ened in sympathy and was reported sold down
as low as $1 18%. . â¢
A line of 1400 ctls came in from Kansas
and cold in bulk at $1 11% for export. ' Under
the provisions of the offering it had to go
for export to be purchasable at this figure,
for It came in under an export freight rate,
and If sold for local use IDe freight would
have to be added, besides the cost of eacklng,
which would place Its price somewhat about
â¢$1 35.

Hay and Feedstuffs.
There was no change in anything yesterday.
The circular of Somers & Co. said of Hay:
'â¢Receipts of Hay for the past week have
amounted to 3990 tons, in . comparison with
3480 tons for the week preceding. This Is
the heaviest week we have had for some time
past, and the amount of Hay brought in is
too great for our market to stand, especially
at this time of year, when the majority of
consumers are well stocked up.
"The export trade, which has been quite
active of late, has held the market up, and,
although the amount shipped, away has been
small compared to the estimated surplus of
Hay in ] the country, yet it must .be acknowl
edged a potent factor In holding prices up to
the present range. ;Of course it is impossible
to foretell how long this demand will con
tinue, but one thing seems certain, should it
suddenly cease, consignees would have much
more difficulty in disposing of their shipments
than --they have at", present. - .^â -Â«^--r-Â«i-TÂ»u----;
"The continuance of abundant " rains*" has
given assurance of good crops and this has
caused many holders of Hay to week a market
for their stocks. Considerable amounts have
been offered from all sections of the country,
but present ' conditions give little encourage
ment for any one to buy." â¢-**

BOARD MEMBERS
WANT TO KNOW
The members of the Board of Public
Works yesterday adopted a resolution
asking thÂ« City Attorney for an
opinion as to whether they or the Su
pervisors have the power to designate
what kind of paving material shall be
used for street work. The opinion is
desire* in view of the fact that the
Works Board has recommended the use
of bitumen on H street, between Sev
enth and Twentieth avenues, and Mis
sion street, between Oncndaga and Por
ter avenues, and the Sup. , visors' Street
Committee insists on asphalt being
used in the paving; of the two streets.
The board awarded tho contract for
paving and widening Fourth street,
from Market to Howard, to Flinn &
Treacy for SI7.6SS 64.
The board also awarded the contracts
for repaying the street in front of thÂ«
Phelan building and repairing Market
street from Second to Twelfth to the
City Street Improvement Company, th*
lowest bidder. The former contract will
cost about $1000 and the latter only $495.
Bids were ordered invited for th*Â» re
pair of bituminous pavements on block*
on Second. Third. Eighth. , Folsom,
Front. California. Sansome, Montgom
ery, Kearay. Bush, Sutter and Post
streets, sadly in need of it.
City Engineer Woodward reported
that all property owners maintaining
area walks on Fourth street, between
Market and Howard, have been in
structed to reconstruct the same along
the official curb line of the street. The
gas, water, telephone and other compa
nies have been notified to prepare for
the improvement of the street, and- the
United Railroads to set back thetr poles
four feet on each side of the street, an
the sidewalk widths will be reduced
from nineteen. to fifteen feet.
The bid of $1075 for the construction
of a safety station at Market anl
Powell streets was rejected as exces
sive and new proposals ordered invited.
Representatives of the California
Automobile Club extended a personal
invitation to the members of the boar'l
to attend a smoker on Saturday even
ing February 18. and took occasion to
compliment the board for its efforts to
have the streets repaired.

MAKE RARE ATTRACTION FOR PARK
(STOXK IMAGES OF BUDDHA WHICH HAVE ! r.KN IMPORTED FROM JAPAN
BT THE PARK COMMISSIONERS ANIJ WHICH WIL.U BE INSTALLED IN
THE JAPANESE TEA GARDEN AT OOL,DEN GATE PARK.
Success has attended the efforts of i
the Park Commissioners to obtain from
the temples of Japan two stone
Buddha^ for the Japanese tea garden
in Golden Gate Park. The idols were
procured after considerable search for
just such specimens as would be de
sirable. It was soon ascertained by the
agent in the Orient who was author
ized by the commissioners to obtain
the specimens, that the tourists of the
world in quest of similar idols in stone
had been remarkably active, and as a
result of such activity the representa
tive of the park board had to send far
inland to get the images.
The pair of idols arrived in San
Francisco a few days ago, and after
having passed the ordeal of Custom
House inspection were conveyed to the
park museum. Yesterday the Buddhas
Â« ere taken to the Japanese tea garden:
one of the idols bears an inscrip
tion which indicates that it wife pre

the direction of Superintendent Mc-

installed in the tea garden by next

Stanley Bates. Scion of a

ily.* in Serious Trouble
Stanley Bates, scion pt the wealthy
j Bates family of Los Angeles and
1 former society man of the southern
i city, is in a cell in the City Prison
j charged with trying to pass a worthless
money -order on John J. Daughney, a
saloon man at â¢ 'Fourth and Folsom
streets.- Bates -was formerly clerk of [
the St. Clement Hotel, on Fourth street,
but was discharged frc-m his position
last September. . - . - -
Bates was in the habit of depositing \
! raonÂ«y with Daughney, and when the
'â  Knights Templar conclave was at its <
i height .last September Bates did much !
business in this line with the saloon .
j man. â ; â  . . -
. He drew on Daughney.; at the time ;
j for .$65. and when the latter asked for '
a settlement he save him an order on j
j E. Kins of the St. Clement Hotel for
i the j amount. Daughney could = not lo- J
j cate King for some time, but when he i
| did find the hotel man he was told that
Bates* accounts were in bad shape and !
that he ' had no money coming. ' ' .. i
Bates is - reported to have been short |
: In his accounts while a clerk at King's â 
Hotel, but if such deficiency ' occurred
it was made good. by the young man's i
, mother. . . ; .
Daughney did not prosecute the i
young. man at that time, as the latter
I promised to make a settlement. Last '
; Saturday, night Bates came to Daugh- {
i ney and tried to cash a check for $500.
! Daughney was suspicious, and, would
j not cash the paper. Bates returned
[ next day and tried to have Daughney's i
j partner cash the check,, -but failed I
j again. On â  Monday night Bates made !
I another attempt to get money, for the !
| check from Daughney. *â *......._
This time the saloon man took Bates
to task and asked what â  he meant.
Bates tried to . make excuses, and
I Daughney called a policeman and had
I the young man taken to the City Pris
j on on a charge of passing a worthless
' order. Detective Tom Gibson took !
! charge of the case, but failed to find
i the check, . which Bates has evidently
] destroyed. . . . Â -
Bates is married â¢to a : young . and

Say Complaint Is Unwarranted.
School Directors Boyle and Altman
yesterday visited the James Lick and
Xoe Valley schools to investigate the
cf-mplaint of the West of Castro Club
against the interchange of two primary
and grammar classes. The directors
f<und that more than fifty per cent of
the pupils in the classes transferred
live within five blocks of the respective
schools and on that account regard the
complaint as unwarranted.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. THURSDAY. FEBRUARY 9. 1905.
WIFE'S FORGIVENESS FAILS TO SUE
JAMES ROGERS FROM COURT'S REBUKE
Wants him Dismissed From Custody,
But Appeaf Comes Too Late.
WAYWARD GIRLS PROMISE TO BE GOOD
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
To unwarranted interference with
! his domestic life by neighbors did
James Rogers, building contractor, as
1 cribe the marital conditions that even
; tuated in his arrest a,nd arraignment
before Police Judge Fritz on the
' charge of wife beating.
For three years, Mr. Roger? in
| formed the court, he fairly reveled in
connubial bliss, and then he unfor
tunately removed his household estab-
lishment to 1608 Pacific street, where
he and his better half. Augusta* M..
v.ere hardly settled when infelicity en
tered and bided, with varying; degrees
of discord, until it culminated In the
occurrence that climaxed In his Incar
ceration. During peaceful intervals he
had wondered why the jars happened,
and his conclusion was that if certain
hcus^wivAc; living 1 in the vicinity had
attended to their own business and
abstained from counseling hi? wife
there would not have been any jars.
As he spoke he glanced significantly at
two matrons who had testified for the
prosecution, and one of them ex
claimed "Mercy!" while the other
i glared angrily at him and said,
â¢â¢w-e-i-i:-
As for the accusation that he had
battered his wife. Mr. Rogers pro
nounced it preposterous, despite what
1 she or any of her witnesses might
have sworn to the contrary. When he
left home that morning it whs with
bitter feeling toward the complainant,
because they had engaged in a matuti
nal "tiff." but as the day advanced his
anger waned and when he returned at
eventide he was eager to forgive and
to be forgiven. With outstretched
hands and in conciliatory spirit he ad
' vanced upon his helpmate, but she,
'. apparently misunderstanding his in
tention, started in affright and col
| Ikied with one of his fists. Then she
! raised a window and loudly screamed
"Police!" and neighbors gathered be
neath the lattice and called him un
complimentary names. When the
police arrived he offered no resistance.
At the conclusion of Mr. Rogers' de
; fense the two lady witnesses. Eva
Markell and Jane Haspteau. looked at
each other with elevated eyebrows and
; mournfully shook their heads. Mrs.
Rogers, however, was differently im
pressed by the narrative, for she gazed
tenderly at the defendant and then re
quested the Judge to dismiss him. But
the mischief was done. He was pro
nounced guilty and remanded for sen
tence, with bail fixed at $200, which
yap furnished.
â¢ â¢ â¢
Seventeen-year-old Margie Prentz,
charged with waywardness by her
mother, professed penijence and whs
told to go and sin no more. She ran
nwuy from home four months ago.
Judge Conlan was informed, and an
officer of the Boys' and Girls' Aid So
ciety traced her to Oakland, where he
f< and her living under an assumed
name fan a disreputable house on Fifth
street. When told that she must ac
company him, she went to her room
to don street attire, but almost imme
diately reappeared and frantically
called for her mother to come and
kiss her for the last time, as she had
taken poison. She was hurriedly re
moved to a hospital and treated until
she was past the danger point, after
which she was conveyed across the
bay and to prison. She wept copious
ly as the Judge pointed out the error
of her way and depicted the inevita
ble finish of the life which she had
dtserted her mother to adopt.
Marian TÂ»mple. 19 years of age,
also promised to reform if Judge Mo
gan would temper justice with mercy.
Betrayal under promise of marriage
led to her disgrace and abandonment
of her mother, .a professional nurse,
who expressed willingness to forgive.
The girl was dismissed.
Charles Perino, a barber, disclaimed
paternity of the infant child which his
wife accused him of failing to provide
for. He told Judge Fritz that after
the birth of the babe, at Eureka, he
was forced by a body of citizens of
that town to marry the woman. They
shoved him into a carriage, he said,
and compelled him. under dire threats
of bodily injury, to make the woman
his Wife. He had never seen the baby,
nor had he ever lived with its mother.
The case went over till next Mon
day.
â¢ â¢ â¢
W. M. English, accused of defraud
ing a hackman, averred that he had
acted the part of a Samaritan and was
entitled to commendation instead of
arrest for it. In a saloon at Ellis and
Powell streets J. Dunphy of 2122 Wash
ington street had been knocked down
by an unknown assailant and was pros
trate and unconscious when Mr. Eng
lish summoned Hackman F. Meyers
and in that person's conveyance ac
companied the Injured man to the
Emergency Hospital, where he is under
treatment for a skull fracture. Meyers
demanded that English pay the car
riage hire, but English declined to do
so and was arrested. Judge Conlan
continued the case till Friday.
Miss Ida Smith, charged with having
disturbed the peace of the Tenderloin
by hailing passing pedestrians whom
she did not know, electrified Judge
Mogan's court by proving that she was
not a vagrant, but a regular recipient
of large .sums of money from her
wealthy father in England, her last
remittance being $17,000.
i live on Fair Oaks street and am
easily worth $50,000," she said, "and I
was calling after Haekdriver Egan to
come back with my diamond sunburst,
which I had left in his cab, when the
policeman arrested me and said 1 was
â rounding.' Guess I had a right to re
cover my sunburst before somebody
would find it in the cab and keep It,
hand't 1?"
She disclosed a remarkable acquaint
ance with the names of persons and
places familiar to the half-world, and
she wore costly apparel and, sparkling
gems. Several policeman corroborated
her claim to being a remittance woman,"
and Htated that she had a pf-nchant for
cab-riding in the red-light district, but
otherwise she was harmless. So she
was dismissed.
John McDonnell, accused of having
sold pools to women in his dry goods
store at 3242 Mission street, was dis
charged because the police were unable
to prove that pools had been purchased
from him. although they foiind charts
and racing forms and other gaming
paraphernalia on his premises. Before ;
ordering dismissal of the case, how
wer, Judge Mogan expressed his per
sonal opinion that Mr. McDonnell was
guilty as charged, and roundly de
nounced the surreptitious selling of
racing pools to women in the residence
districts.
"Gaming places in the guise of mer
cantile establishments are a menace to
the city's home life." said his Honor.
"for they place temptation to bet in
the way of women whose means do
not permit of that luxury. Wives of
workingmen cannot afford to wager on
horse race* and defray their house
hold expenses', and husbands and chil
dren are made to suffer by the pecuni
ary looses. T shall visit the law's ex- '
tieme penalty on any person proved
guilty before me of having combined
pool selling with legitimate business." j
* â¢ *
Michael Salvo of 1107 Kearny street
declared that the eansizing of his two
horv-e t**am at Point I^obos and Th'rty
fourth avenues was directly attributa
ble to the equestrian eccentricities of
John Ginocoehi. although the pedes
trian freaks of Milton Crow wer â  not
entirely free of responsibility for the
mischief. With his wagon laden with
Vegetables, Signor Salvo told Judge
Mogan. he was driving rttywarj when
Ginocochi, astride a sable steed, and
Crow, afoot, met and ac:osted hi;n. j
Being unacquainted with undented
Knglish, Signor Salvo imagined they j
were plain clothes policemen requesting |
him to display a peddler's license, and I
he promptly brought forth and showed
to them a document of that kind au- j
thorizing him to hawk vegetables and'
fruit at retail. Then, to his surprise, <
Ginocochi began to caracoh: his lr.-iunt i
in a way that might make any director j
of haute ecole enviou*, while Crow cut ;
some antics with his legs and arms j
that were also masterly in th-?ir way. i
Signor Salvo was in doubt a* to wheth
er he had run against a pair of escaped j
lunatics or was witnessing a double '
case of sudden insanity when his own j
horses began to fidget and back his j
wagon to the brink of a steep declivity !
at the roadside, and then he realized [
that the ostensibly imbecile exhibition \
was of malicious inspiration. While the >
steed of Ginocochi stood erect upon its â¢
hind legs and wildly pawed the atmos- ]
phere with its front ditto. Crow cut I
pigeon wings and curlecues and made a â 
human jumpingjaek of himself, all !
with evident intent to encourage the j
affrighted horses of Salvo to continue
their retrograde movement until they
backed the wagon over the cliff. That
very thing was done, and for being in- j
strumental in the doing of it Signor
Salvo had Ginocochi and Crow arrested
and jointly booked for disturbing the
peace.
The defendants denied the alleged
malicious mischief and said that Signor
Salvo had only his own negligence to
blame for the overthrow of his team.
After they had addressed him jokingly,
they added, he stopped his horses and
relinquished control of the reins in or
der to free his hands so that he could
extend them like fans, and with thumb
points touching his nose wave his fin
gers slowly to and fro. the movement
I being expressive of derision. So intent
I was he upon thus signaling his con
j tempt that he l j ft his horses to do as
| they pleased, and to back the wagon
; and themselves over the precipice was
apparently what pleased them.
The testimony Is being assayed and
returns may be announced to-day.

That begins at Hale's this morning. Unusual in quality, unusual in variety, unusual in prices

things in a strikingly different and better way that he is recognized and remembered. The same

. And when we founded this business we planned to do it in a different and better way. It's
primarily due to that idea that we are able to sell bright, new spring silks at the very start of the sea-
son for much less than the prices they were made to sell for. ; ..^
But a closer reason is the fact that buying silks for six stores through one order is a power-
ful magnet. A closer reason yet is the determination to do the silk business in such a different and
better way in 1905 that hundreds more women will come to think Hale's naturally when they think silks.

FOUNDER'S DAY
IS OBSERVED
Public Shows Its Interest in
the Wilmerding School
and Inspects Departments
Founder's day was observed at the
Wilmerding School of Industrial Arts
yesterday. The interest shown by the
public seemed to surpass even that of
previous years. Throughout the after
noon there was a large attendance.
John A. Britton, Regent of the Uni
versity of California, delivered an ad
dress in the hearing of iIOO boys in the
morning. He started out to trace the
development of San Francisco and the
country tributary to it as he had seen
it during the last forty years.
Regent Britton predicted a still great
er development during the next genera
tion, and pointed out to his youtluul
audience the wonderful opportunities
in this community that were awaiting
men of intelligence and character, n.en
with just such an education- as is af
forded at the Wilmerding School.
On the platform with Regent Britton
were Regents R. J. Taussig. chairman of
the Wilmerding School committee: Guy
C. Earl. John'E. Budd and Dr. C. N.
Ellinwood.
From 1 o'clock until 4 the public
came in large numbers and paid their
respects to George A. Merrill, th^ di
rector. The boys, in their workday
clothes, escorted the visitors thrcugh
the departments of bricklaying, plumb
ing, carpentry, electricity, cabinet
making, wood carving, architecture and
the laboratories and draughting-room?.
The young students are already well
forward with their new permanent
brick buildings, which are to form im
portant additions to the school. L,. H.
Werson, instructor in building, ex
plained the various and progressive
stages of his pupils in the building line.
Much interest was also shown in th?
departments of architecture and elec
tricity. The whole course of studies
was fully investigated by those who
avatled themselves of the chance to see
the departments in full working trim.
The new athletic ground has just
been completed. It has a strong retain
ing wall, surrounded by a ten-lap cmi
i der track, all of which has be^n con
structed by the boys of the school.

MARCONI PLANT
OPERATES WELL
The Call Sends Wireless
.Messages to Battleship
Ohio Several Miles at Sea
The new Marconi wireless telegraph
plant on Union-square avenue, lately
installed by Roland D. Onffroy and
operated by Dennis J. OBrien. is in
good working order, and many suc
cessful tests have been made lately.
Yesterday the plant was in communi
cation with the battleship Ohio several
miles outside the Heads, and many
messages were sent backward and for
ward, being relayed by the Goat Island
station.
The messages began to crune in
shortly before 7 oclock in the morning,
when the Ohio was a hundred miles
from the bar. Admiral Whiting sent
his greetings a"d told of the cruise of
the ship. At 1:30 a message of con
gratulation from The Call was sent
and a prompt reply received. The
Call's message read as follow?:
"The Call sends congratulations to
Admiral Whiting and hopes he had a
pleasant trip. Anything new? Signed
John McXaught." The reply came
promptly and was as follows:
"To Marconi Wireless Station D,
From Battleship Ohio at Seaâ San
Francisco Call: Thanks for your kin.l
ness. Nothing new. Trials generally
successful. Bad weather Sunday. Ohio
is a good sea ship. Signed Whiting."
Several messages of official character
and otherwise were ticked back and
forth from the ship to the station. TIM
local plant worked to perfection, as did
the station at Goat Island, and also
the one located at the navy headquar
ters at Mare Island.
The messages are received *after the
manner of cable messages on long reels
of narrow paper, and the characters
are marked in the standard Morse al
phabet by a delicate indicator. This
plan was a success from the start
and. has been uspd exclusively at the
new station. The tests are being car
ried on daily, with the approval of the
i United States Navy Department.
The World's Beauties.
San Francisco has the distinction of
having within its boundaries the most
beautiful store in the world. It is sim
ply beyond the powers of description, a
fairy land of dazzling lights, beautiful
paintings and flashing gems. The pleas
ure of a visit will linger with you al
ways. Colonel A. Andrews' Diamond

Angeles. Placed Under Arrest

number of her baggage check and
wired it to Chief Wittman, who de

They went to the depot and followed

Hotel Netherlands, on Turk street,
where they found Graham and his
wife in a room.
