Fort After Fort Is
Captured by the
Japanese.
TOKIO, Jan. I.âFollowing the dra
matic assault upon and capture of
Sungshu Mountain, the Japanese at
Port Arthur to-day captured "H" fort
wid the recently constructed fort on
Panning Mountain, giving them pos
session of the entire line between Rih
lung Mountain and "H" fort, via Pan
lung Mountain. Simultaneously with
. the capture of these forts the extreme
right, pressing along Pigeon Bay, cap
tured the heights south of Housan
yantao. Telegraphing to-day the head
quarters of the besieging forces says:
"A part of the center, dislodging the
enemy, occupied 'H' fort at 7 o'clock
this morning and also captured the new
fort on Panlung Mountain. Thus the
Una between BJhlung Mountain and
*H' fort, via Panlung Mountain, fell
firmly into our hands.
"A part of the right, commencing a
bombardment at 8 o'clock this morn
ing and dislodging the enemy, which
resisted stubbornly, firmly occupied the
heights south of Housanyantao at 2
o'clock this afternoon."
The news of theÂ»continuance of Jap
. aneee successes at Port Arthur is re
ceived with elation in Tokio. It is
known that the Japanese losses are
comparatively slight and it is believed
that the garrison is finally reaching the
limits of its strength of endurance.
A telegram from the besieging army
at Port Arthur received to-day says:
"Through an opening at the entrance
into the bomb-proof in the gorge at
Sungshu Mountain all the entombed
Russians were gradually brought out. I
The rescued number two officers and
more than 160 men. According to the
prisoners about 150 corpses are buried
under the debris caused by the ex
plosion of our mines.
"The trophies taken include field and
machine guns not yet enumerated.
"At 6 o'clock Saturday morning our
sapping body in front of the east fort
on Panlung Mountain blew up a part
of the old Chinese wall. It is now con
structing defense works there."
MONTH OF REVERSES.
Sii-onghold's Defenders Reduced toj
Their I .est Extremity.
â¢ CHBFU, Jan. 2.âThe news that the I
Russian forces at Port Arthur have |
been reduced to such a strait that at
last the heroic commander has been
â¢ forced to propose surrender follows
upon a month of reverses. The siege
began almost with the firing of the
t first gun in the war, now nearly eleven
months ago. and when perhaps the
greatest stronghold in the world was
. garrisoned by 40,000 Russian soldiers,
supported by a formidable s uadron of
modern battleships, .cruisers and tdr
. pedo-boats. These warships have been
destroyed or dispersed until but a few
torpedo-boats remain in the harbor.
THE San Francisco CALL
The garrison, ' 1 latest accounts, had
been reduced to about 15,000 men.
On December 4 High (203-meter) Hill,
one of the most commanding positions
in the series of forts held by the Rus
sians, was captured by the Japanese
after a severe fight in which the loss
on both sides was enormous. It was
from this hill that the death blows
were dealt to the warships that were
then remaining in the harbor, and
afterward the Japanese guns were
trained upon the town and such forts
as were within range.
On December 19 the East Keekwan
fort was taken by the Japanese, af
fording them another advantageous po
sition from which to assail other forts
in the chain of defenses. Mining and
sapping were Important factors in the
capture of this position, as they were
in the fall of the Rihlung fort on De
cember 29.
All these achievements served to cut
communication between the Liaoti fort,'
destined to be "the last ditch" of the
| defenders, from a great part of the
chain of forts.
From the hour of the fall of East
Keekwan events have seemed to be
hastening to their culmination, for on
December 31 Sungshu Mountain fell
into the hands of the besiegers, and
only a few hours later the "H" fort,
another strong position, was captured.
The report that the non-combatants
of Port Arthur had been accorded asy
lum behind Liaoti Mountain may have
been au indication that the Japanese
commander foresaw that the surrender
of the Russians within a brief time
was assured.
WILL BUILD GREAT NAVY.
Russia to Take Her Place Among
First-Class Sea Powers,
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. I.âWith
reference to the report published in
the United States under a St Peters
burg date that Emperor Nicholas has
sanctioned the expenditure of $80,000 -
000 for rebuilding the navy, the fact
is that Russia's naval programme has
not yet been definitely decided or pro
mulgated. All that is positively knqwn
is that the plans oover a long period
of years. The absolute necessity of a
sea power is one of Russia's latest les
sons of the present war, and with
practically the complete destruction of
the Port Arthur fleet the Government
is determined not only on filling the
gap, but on building up a fleet which
will keep Russia fully abreast of other
first-class powers.
Â«
SLAVS APPEAR HELPLESS.
Little Opposition to the Japanese At
tack Upon Sungshu.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE THIRD
JAPANESE ARMY, Saturday, Decern- ;
ber 31. âThe fort on Sungshu Moun- j
tain was captured at 11 o'clock in the j
morning. The works were mined and !
exploded at 10 o'clock, many Rus
sians being killed and buried in the
debris. Those who remained in the
fort were captured. There was little 1
opposition to the attack. The north- i
eastern section of the fort was de- j
stroyed. affording cover for the as- j
saulters. The Japanese now hold forts !
guarding the entire western half of I
the eastern fort ridge.

RUSSIANS DESTROY FORTS.

cause of a shortage of men and am
munition.

CHEFU, Jan. 2, Â»:16 A. M.âFour
Russian torpedo boat destroyersâthe
Skory, the Stratni, the Vlastni and
the Serdityâaccompanied by a large
launch, arrived here this morning from
Port Arthur. Two other destroyers arc
repoted to have gone to Tsingtau.
The activity aboard the destroyers
seemingly indicates an intention of put
ting to sea again. What appear to be
Japanese destroyers can be seen with
the aid of glasses in the dim distance.
A bundle of dispatches was sent
ashore from one of the Russian de
stroyers.
The captain of the Stratni says that
they left Port Arthur because it had
been impossible for ships to live in the
harbor since the Japanese captured
203-Meter Hill. The destroyers en
countered no Japanese warships en
route to this port.
For the past five days ; the Japanese
are reported to have been ceaselessly
storming Port Arthur on all sides.
Captain Kartow, commanding the
tcrpedo-boat destroyer Vlastni, says
the Japanese expected to enter Port
Arthur on Tuesday, but that General
Stoessel, who was sick, will resist with
the remnant of the garrison on Liaoti
Mountain.
Captain Kartow denies the report
from Tokio that General Stoessel of
fered to surrender yesterday. The Rus
sians yesterday blew up two of their
own forts near the railway and com
pleted the destruction of the cruiser
Bayan.
The destroyers Smirli and Boiki ajso
left Port Arthur yesterday. Their fate
is unknown.
Port Arthur is described by to-day's
arrivals as a "living hell." The hospi
tals are said to be nearly all de
stroyed.

IN PRISON
Pathetic Meeting at
Which Both Are
Overcome.
Woman Pleads lor Confi
dence and Proclaims
Her Innocence.
Husband's Onj Reply Is That He
Hopes She" Has Told Him
the Truth.
CLEVELAND, Jan. I.âUnheralded,
unembarrassed by a crowd of the cu
rious, the homecoming to-day of Dr.
Leroy S. Chad wick was in diametric
contrast to the arrival of his wife three
weeks ago. The hour of the day and
the fact that but few persons were
about made the doctor's arrival like
that of am.ordinary traveler. No one
was at the station to meet him, with
the exceTafljfon of -Attorney Kerruish.
Even hiwnÂ»*Â»Ds-TdR Emil,' failed to see
him until o'clock. Young Hoover had
planned ti board the train at an outly
ing station, but the train had come into
that station and departed before Emil
was aware of the fact.
Sheriff Barry, in whose company Dr.
Chadwick was on the trip from New
York, chose to come to Cleveland over
.the Pennsylvania road. Tlie train ar
iived at Cleveland at 7:30 o'clock this
morning. The Sheriff and Dr. Chad
wick were driven to the County Jail
quickly. A bond proviced on Saturday
evening by Attorney Virgil P. Kline
and Attorney Dawley was at the Jail
on the arrival of Dr. Chadwick and he
soon was released. After the prelimi
naries in the Sheriff's office Dr. Chad
wick was escorted by Sheriff Barry to
the fourth floor of the women's ward,
where his wife is held a '
WIFE PLEADS WITH HUSBAND.
The meeting between the two was
pathetic in the extreme. Mrs. Chadwick
arose when she heard the steps in the
corrdior and fell into her husband's
arms when she recognized him. Both
wept convulsively for several minutes
while clinging to each other, the Sheriff
attempting meanwhile to console them.
There was no artificiality about the
scene. Genuine grief, genuine Joy in
termingled. Even the Sheriff, hardened
as he must be by continual contact
with persons in every form of dis
tress, was deeply affected.
Little by little the first shock grew
less severe and the two sat down for
a talk that continued for an hour and
a half. There were pleadings and par
tial responses when the more serious
predicament of husband and wife was
at length appreciated.
Dr. Chadwick has lost his all in the
operations of his wife and the large
independent fortune of his only child
has been swept awayâsufficient reason,
it would seem, for some show of hard
ness on his part. Mrs. Chadwick tried
to imbue him with the thought of her
innocence of any wrongdoing. His
only response to these pleas was: "I
hope so."
The troubles into which both have
been plunged were thoroughly dis
cussed. The wife told the story, inter
spersed by violent fits of weeping, in
which at times Dr. Chadwick Joined.
There were no apparent evasions, but
there was a constant cry of ""Trust
me! trust me!" on the part of the
woman.
STILL PROCLAIMS INNOCENCE.
"Don't believe these stories which
the newspapers hay been printing
about me," she said. "They are all j
lies, every one of them. I have done
nothing wrong. Believe me; trust \
me; everything will come out all
right in the end and it will be seen
that I have been guilty of none of
these things the public charge m;
with. Don't think I deceive you; I
will tell you the truth and I tell you
that all these reports are liesâites."
"I can only hope so," was the hus
band's answer. "I have trusted you
and it is hard to believe anything;
my mind is so confused. This has
such a terrible shock and I djn':
understand any of it. I want time to
think of it. Ido not say I won't trust
you, only give me time to collect my
thoughts, since I heard of this
trouble in Paris, I have been bothered
and my life has been made a mo3t
ut.bearable one. I have been followed
and hounded until I can think of
nothing else. I am not the Judge. I
can only hope that everything will
come out all right, as you say."
After an hour's earnest con
versation, conducted for the most
part in scarcely audible whis
pers. Sheriff Barry was asked
by Mrs. Chadwick to send for
her attorney, J. P. Dawley, who was
waiting with Attorney Kerruish in the
Jail office. Dawley went to Mrs. Chad

SACRAMENTO. Jan. I.âThe mem
bers of the Legislature are here ready
for the business of the session, and the
indications are that organization of
both houses will be effected to-morrow,
so that balloting for United States Sen
ator may begin on Tuesday of next
week. The Senatorial contest, how
ever interesting it may be later on, is
at present partially eclipsed by the
/strenuous fight for the position of
Sergennt-at-Arms of the Assembly
Stafford, who is supported by Charles
F. Curry, Secretary of State, and
Lamphrey, who is backed by James
Gillis, State Librarian, are the candi
dates for the favor of Republican As
semblymen. Curry says the fight is won
for Stafford. Gillis holds that Lamph
rey is already the winner.
The contest between Jacob Steppa
cher of San Francisco and Clio Lloyd of
Santa Barbara for the Chief Clerkship
of the Assembly is engaging the atten
tion of Statesmen. f
Dr. Rowell, C. M. Belshaw, James A.
Louttit, Frank J. Brandon, David T.
Perkins, J. R. Dorsey, C. A. Young, E.
O. Gerberding and many other active
supporters of Senator Bard's candidacy
for re-election were at Bard headquar
ters at the Capitol Hotel to-night. Dr.
Rowell speaks highly of the Senator's
prospects and predicts that Bard will
take the lead on the first ballot and
maintain it until the finish.
The Bard meji are in favor of im
mediate organization of the Legisla
ture so that the real t*-s of the
strength of the several aspirants may
be shown as early as posFihle. The
remark is made at Bard headquarters
that the Flint boomers are openly
claiming the support of Senators and
Assemblymen who are known to be in
favor of the Senator's re-election and
will so record themselves when the
roll is called. All signs point to a good
natured contest for the favor of the
Republican majority of the Legisla
ture. There is nothing in sight to in
dicate that the fight will prompt any
candidate to lavish expenditures of
money or elaborate entertainments of
statesmen in order to gain prestige.
FAVOR A CAUCUS.
Advocates of the caucus system are
saying that a Republican caucus
should be held at once to settle the
Senatorship. It is readily admitted
that fifty-six Republicans would be re
quired to determine the result in cau
cus while sixty would settle the ques
tion in joint convention. The argu
ment, however, is put forward that
adherence to the custom at this time
would be accepted hereafter as a bind
ing precedent.
George A. Knight, Henry T.
Oxnard. Frank P. Flint and Sena
tor Cheater Rowell, arrived here this
evening. They were not long upon
the ground before each was willing to
SOME OF THE MEN WHO ARE

ISLATORS IN SACRAMENTO.
hazard an opinion as to the situation
and the clashing opinions are only
limited by the number of those that
offered them.
"I will be elected." said Gecrrge A.
Knight. "I am confident that no one
can withhold from me the honor of
representing California in the Senate
of the United States. In answer to the
claim that Southern California is en
titled to the Senatorship I have but
one thing to say. California is a sov
ereign State and the man that is elect
ed by this Legislature to represent the
State in the Senate will be elected to
represent the whole State, not any
single portion of it. So rar as popu
lation, wealth and territory are con
cerned, San Francisco is entitled to the
Senatorship. Why, we have one bank
in the city that is richer than the com
bined interests of Southern California,
But this question is too broad to dis
cuss in this vein. Â« is not a sectional
fight; it is a fight of the people of the
whole State to be well represented.
"And so far as the statements are
made that certain candidates in the
fight are so-called organisation candi
dates. I think it is all rot. Every man
in this fight is a free man; there are
no collars in evidence. I am in this
fight to win and I am going to win,
that is all there is to the situation."
OXNARD IX SANGUINE.
While Oxnard was not as broad in
his claims as Knight, he showed no
signs of discouragement and discussed
the situation with many friends that
called at his headquarters in the Gold
en Eagle.
"I am here," said Oxnard, "with a
substantial support and I shall use
every honorable means to see that my
strength is Increased. I am not
claiming everything in the world, but
as to the loyalty of. the support I have
there is no question.
"And I can say this: The returns of
the recent election show that Califor
nia' is in favor of the policy of Theo
dore Roosevelt. I am also in favor of
this policy, and If I am elected to the
Senate of the United States, as I be
lieve I will be, I will do everything in
my power, first to further the interests
of California and always to adhere to
the policy of Roosevelt California has
so strongly Indorsed.'
Shortly after his arrival here Flint
retired. He is not feeling well and
thought It best not to begin the fight
too strenuously.

as I would like to." said Flint, "before
committing myself to a statement.
However, everything- looks favorable.
To-morrow I will be able to tell better
just how the situation stands."
Senator Rowell is confident that the
so-called claims of organization sup
port are unfounded, and that the ac
tivity of certain railroad employes ap
parently in favor of certain candi
dates is unauthorized by railroad head
quarters, even if the railroad is going
to be yielded to the legislators of
the State in the matter or the selection
of a United States Senator.
BARD ALU THE TIME.
"Senator Bard will draw the largest
vote upon the first ballot," said Senator
Rowell, "and we hope that his frrends
will remain loyal to him, as they have
always done in the past, and as we feel
sure they will do on this occasion. We
are sure that from the first ballot on
Senator Bard's strength will increase
until he is re-elected to the office he
has filled with such credit to himself
and to the State. I do not think Sena
tor Bard will be here during the ses
sion of the Legislature, but I presume
that he will come to Sacramento if his
presence here is imperatively demand
ed. However, J do not anticipate that
his presence wfll be required here. Hit
friends will guard his interests well."
At a caucus of the San Francisco
delegation held to-night Assemblyman
George A. McGowan was selected chair
man. Assemblyman T. E. Atkinson was
first suggested to preside as chairman
of the delegation, but withdrew upon
what he says is assurance that a com
bination has been formed to place him
as Speaker pro tern, of the House. At
kinson Is apparently positive that he
will win this office, but the decree of a
caucus of thirty-three members of the
House representing widely scattered
sections of the State is against him.
Early in the day Assemblyman S. H.
Olmstead of San Rafael was talked of
for Speaker pro tern., but when he
heard that F. A. CromVell of Petaluma
was a candidate for the honor he with
drew. At the caucus George T. Rolley
was first mentioned for Speaker pro
tern., but he does not care to accept the
honor. Cromwell waa agreed on, and
to-night it looks like he will be elect
ed, the claim of Atkinson notwithstand
inK ' STEPPACHER'S FIGHT.
However, the desire of Atkinson to
bold the office of Speaker pro tern, has
seriously interfered with the candi
dacy of Steppacher for chief clerk of
the House. Atkinson's ambition is
centering too many favors in San Fran
cisco, and to-night the friends of Clio
Lloyd. who is battling for the office of
chief clerk, are confident that he will
win. Bteppacher. however, is also con
fident, so confident that he has sourned
every offer of compromise.

who arrived here from Philadelphia
last night and immediately sought se
clusion in the home of Vessley N. W.
Hillier, one of the men whose names
appear on the presentment of Bishop
Talbot, left for the East at noon to
day.
Dr. Irvine looked careworn and hag
gard. During his short visit he refused
to meet newspaper interviewers.
Dr. Irvine's unexpected departure to
day is viewed here as inexplicable,
alike by his friends and opponents. He
communicated with none of his former
vestrymen or parishioners, and denied
himself to all friends. It is generally
believed that the briefness of his visit
was due to his failure to influence the
vestrymen who have repudiated their
signatures on the presemnent to per
mit their names to remain on that pa
per.
It is understood that an effort was
made by Dr. Irvine to communicate
with John Langdon, one of the men
who repudiated the presentment, but

The insurance business, except for
the Baltimore fire, has never been more
prosperous. The life part of It Is mani
fested by the early report of the New

, states that the new year has produced

\ any similar company. The policy hold

the insurance in force approximates
$2,000,000,000 in amount.
The last quarter of the year added
nearly $130,000,000 of applications for
new insurance in a total exceeding
$500,000,000 for the year,

I without success. When asked to-day
: whether he had seen Dr. Irinve, Lang
; don said:
i No, and I don't want to. He knows better
than to come to my house. 1 feel deeply
grieved at the publicity my name has been<
given and would gladly escape further an
: noyance. It seems that Irvine's sole purpose
jls to dtstroy the tranquillity of our parish.
I After Dr. Irvine's departure some of
i the details of his visit became known.
\ It was learned that Dr. Irvine and Hil
! lier had some differences over the tele
gram received by Miller, and that Dr.
Irvine left the Hillier house and spent
the night at the home of Miller.
After Dr. Irvine's arrival last night
Hillier called at the home of James
Denithorne and informed him that Dr.
Irvine would like to see him. Langdon
was present. Denithorne replied that if
Dr. Irvine wanted to see him he knew
where to find him. Dr. Irvine, he said
certainly owed him an explanation, but
he did not propose to hunt up the cler
gyman to get it.
During the conversation the Miller
| telegram was mentioned by Denithorne,
! and Hillier said that Dr. Irvine had in
formed him that he had not sent such
a message. Mr. Denithorne produced
the original telegram received by Mil
ler, which surprised Hillier. The latter
then returned home and had a warm
interview with Dr. Irvine, the outcome
of which was that the clergyman went
to the home of Miller.
The telegram in question was that al
leged to have been sent by Dr. Irvine
to Miller urging him to keep quiet and
the misrepresentations in the use of the
vestrymen's signatures would be sat
isfactorily explained.
PHILADELPHIA, Jan. I.âThere was
a growing feeling among clergymen
here to-night that the proceedings
brought by Dr. Irvine against Bishop
Talbot would fall through if the Hunt
ingdon vestrymen persisted in their re
pudiation of the signatures to the pre
sentment. It is believed that if the
Huntingdon men officially Inform Bish
op Tuttle, the presiding Bishop, that
they did not knowingly sign a present
ment the St. Louis prelate will official
ly dissolve the board.
NOTE TELLS THE STORY
OF A LIFE MISSPENT
Missive Left on Pier by Supposed
Suicide Contains Unheeded
Words of Advice.
LOS ANGELES, Jan. IâMystery
surrounds the finding of a grip and
overcoat to-day on the Park
pier, and it is believed the owner com
mitted suicide by jumping into the sea,
or possibly fell in. Letters found in
the coat show it to be the property of
Frank J. Murray of Fort Collins, Colo.,
who left there to make Ocean Park his
home. Murray was seen walking on
the pier, without apparent aim, carry
ing the coat and valise, and nobody
saw him come to the shore.
In the valise was found a peculiar
letter, which may be the key to the
mystery. It is in the handwriting of a
young woman who signs herself
"Kate," and reads:
"Brace up and be a man, now that
you have gone to make a new start.
If you will lead a noble life you will
feel the better for it and mamma will
feel better."

the instructing- of the two prisoneis

During the time of Dawley's pres

REALIZES HER DESOLATION.
When Chadwick arose to leave the
jail, Mrs. Chadwick apparently felt
more than ever before the desolation
of her position. She knew neither
that her husband was her champion
| and protector, nor that his sympathy
; for her had been swept away. She
| clung to him for a moment and
i again pleaded with him for
j his confidence. With tears in his
'â  eyes lie told her she had his confl
| dence until proof was produced to
i shatter it.
The doctor was dazed for a moment
! upon reaching the turnkey's room.
Emil Hoover had arrived at the jail,
j while Dr. Chadwick was with his wife
| and was awaiting his stepfather in the
i office. The father grabbed both hands
of the boy and searched his face a
i moment before speaking.
"Emil," slowly said the doctor. "It
has been a long time since I saw you.
i Many things have happened since
i then."
The boy made no response, and
they started to leave the jail.
| "Has your regard for Mrs. Chad
| wick changed since her ?" began
; began a questioner of Dr. Chadwick,
jas they were leaving the jail.
"I cannot say anything," interrupt
ied the physician. "You will have to
j talk with Mr. Dawley or Mr. Ker-
I ruish."
j "There will be no statement," said
| Dawley; "so you may as well let him
rest."
For permitting Dr. Chadwick to visit
his wife to-day Sheriff Barry may find
himself in trouble with the Federal
authorities. The visit was allowed
without a formal application to the
Federal authorities. Recently Federal
Judge Wing directed that no person
be allowed to see Mrs. Chadwick with
out a permit from the court or the

AT PARTY
Millionaire Host at
Unique New Year
Reception.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
ST. JOSEPH, Mich., Jan. I.âRichard
Crawford, the son of the late Chicago
millionaire, was host at a New Year's
reception last night at his summer
home in Royalton Heights. He made
a speech of welcome to his seventy
five guests at 12 o'clock from the back
of a Holstein bull, which stood sur
rounded by luxuriant furnishings, on
the oil stained floor of the reception
room.
Later in the night Crawford ushered
in a Poland China pig, a Jersey cow,
and a Texas pony. The pony was sad
dled in the reception room and ridden
of the house by one of the guests.
Crawford, who is well known in club
circles of Chicago, is a livestock fan
cier. He declared last night that his
bull was the finest specimen in the
State. He also runs a fashionable liv
ery stable in this city. The guests of
this remarkable party returned to their
homes in the early hours of the morn

HENEY CAUSES
HALL'S REMOVAL
Complains to President of
District Attorney's Fail
ure to Help in Prosecution
PORTLAND, Jan. I.âThe report
printed yesterday that John H. Hall,
I nlted States District Attorney for
Oregon, had been absolutely removed
fiom his office by order of President
Roosevelt is substantiated by later re
ports from Washington and from in
dictments which have occurred here.
The beginning of the trouble dates
back, it seems, prior to the indictments
returned against S. A. D. Puter and
Mrs. Emma Watson, but did not be
come acute until after the recent trial
of the land frauds case.
It is said that George Sorenson was
one of the first causes that led to the
request of Heney that Hall be removed.
Sorenson was wanted badly as a wit
ness by the Government in the Puter-
Watson trial. He had, however, left
for the East and could not be located.
Heney asked that he be found, as his
evidence would have been material in
the completion of the Government's
case. No one seemed to know anything
of his whereabouts until about the close
of the case, when it is asserted Hall
said he thought he knew where Sor
enson could be found- â  It is said that
later it was shown that Hall had been
in communication with Sorenson.
It is stated also that S. B. Ormsby
was to have made a confession last
spring, and that he failed to do so is

folded.
DEFENDS MITCHELL.
Senator Fulton Says Indictment of Col-
league Is Outrage.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 1. âSenator
Fulton of Oregon came to the defense
of Senator Mitchell to-night and de
clared the Indictment of his colleague
by the Grand Jury in Portland a gross
outrage. t He said no one had ever be
fore questioned Senator Mitchell's in
tegrity and that in the end the injus
tice of his treatment would be proved
and he would be completely cleared of
all complicity in the land fraud cases.
Fulton also corrected the impres
sion that United States District Attor
ney Hall, who was removed from office
by the President yesterday, was dis
missed because he was a frierid of
Senator Mitchell. Fulton said he stood
sponsor for Hall and that Mitchell was
especially strong in opposition to him.

Question of Religion Involved
ROTAL COUPLB WHOSE ENGAGEMENT WAS RECENTLY REPORTED, AND IN
WHOSE APPROACHING MARRIAGE, BECAUSE OF THE QUESTIONS OF
RELIGION INVOLVED, THE VATICAN IS TAKING UNUSUAL INTEREST.
ROME, Jan. I.âRumors of the con
templated marriage of King Alfonso to
Princess Victoria, the daughter of the
Duke of Connaught and niece of King
Edward VIL are being discussed from
a religious point of view at the Vatican.
It Is contended there that the British
laws, which are most positive on the
point of a change of religion by any
member of the royal house, would ren
der necessary the celebration of a
mixed marriage, after which the Prin
cess Victoria, being no longer a mem
ber of the British royal family, would
become a Catholic.
The Vatican, however, is most exact
ing regarding the marriage of Catholic
sovereigns, and does not like the idea
of marriage and conversion afterward.
It is stated, admitting that a marriage
between King Alfonso and Princess
Victoria is contemplated, that a solu
tion of question, so far as the Vati
can is concerned, may be found in the

ALL ARRANGED
FOR PEABODY
DENVER, Jan. I.âAnnouncement
was made to-day by the Republicans
that when the General Assembly con
venes in Joint session to canvass the
vote for State officers, as required by
the constitution, two sets of returns
will be presented from .Denver. The
majority report will show a plurality
of about 4000 for Adams, the Demo
cratic candidate for Governor. The
minority report will*set forth exten
sive election frauds and declare that
Governor Peabody carried this county
by a plurality sufficient to overcome
Adams' plurality of about 6000 in the
remainder of the State.
This minority report from Denver
will be supported by the full Repub
lican vote in the Legislature and the
certificate o{. election will be awarded
to Governor Peabody. He will be in
augurated as Governor for a second
term on January 10, the date set by
the constitution, assert the Repub
licans.
This line of action, according to the
view of the Republicans, will make
it necessary for the Democrats to
bring a contest if they should still
care to assert any claim to the Gov
ernorship.
Another announcement by the Re
publicans to-day is that the Senate
when called to order next Wednesday
will consist of twenty-one Republicans
and thirteen Democrats, with one va
cancy.
When the House convenes there will
be forty-seven Republican and eight
een Democratic Representatives. The
vote on joint ballot will be: Repub
licans 68, Democrats, 31.
United States Senator Thomas M.
Patterson, in an address to the people
of the State, has reiterated his decla
ration, made on several previous oc

that his purpose in remaining away

face of certain and ultimate destruc
tion."
For the first time since the siege
began the Nova Krai, whose sole aim
has been seemingly to inspire the gar
rison, betrays signs of the pathetic
hopelessness of even the most heroic
resistance. Discussing the battle of
203-Meter Hill, the Nova Krai says:
"The hill received on its breast the
hammering of SOO-pound shells, which
split even the rocks and went through
18-inch steel as through paper. Who
but Providence can pave us from these
thunderbolts? We do not expect the
Baltic fleet. We do not expect relief,
but we can fight till death.
"What Port Arthur goes through it
is impossible to describe, but Russia
will know what her sons have suffered.
It is past human genius to paint or
describe Port Arthur's sufferings as
they really are."

BOY'S CURIOSITY CAUSES
HIM PAINFUL INJURIES
Lad Wounded by Fragments of Dyna
mite Caps Thrown Into
Fire by Tramps.
NEVADA CITY. Jan. I.âWallace
Porter, aged 15 years, was Injured in a
peculiar manner at Truckee yesterday.
While en route to the Truckee Lumber
Company's mills he was attracted by
a number of sharp explosions in a
large pit. He went to the edge of the
pit and was peering downward when
c.nother explosion occurred, and he was
struck about the head and face by
small pieces of brass-
The pieces of brass were the rem
nants of a number of dynamite caps
that had been thrown into a fire by
three boy tramps that were on the
other side of the pit out of Porter's
view. The tramps took to flight when
they saw the result of their sport.
Two Diplomats Are Honored.
LONDON, Jan. I.âThe royal family
spent New Year's day quietly at Sand
ringham. The New Year honors were
few. Sir E. B. Monson, the retiring
Embassador at Paris, was given a
Baronetcy and the King will place a
residence in Richmond Park at his dis
posal on his retirement from the diplo
matic service. Sir Charles Hardinge,
the Embassador at St. Petersburg, was
decorated with the Grand Cross of St.
Michael and St. George. A number of
Indian officials were similarly honored.
From the religious point of -view,
the feature of the day was the extraor
dinary activity of revivalists, who
held stirring services in London and
elsewhere, enormous crowds displaying
the greatest fervor.
inevitable, as ship after ship suc
cumbed to the huge Japanese shells.
Yaegermeister Balashoff, according toi
the Nova Krai, held a conference with
the Japanese in reference to the protec
tion of the hospitals from the Japanese
shells. The conference resulted in the
making of the Red Cross flags larger
and also the painting of the exposed
sides of the hospitals.
REJOICING IN TOKIO.
Nogi's Message Sends Thrill of Pleas
ure Through Japan's Capital.
TOKIO, Jan. 2 (10:30 a. m.).âGeneral
Nogi's telegram announcing that Gen
eral Stoessel was prepared to discuss
terms of capitulation reached Tokio
early this morning, but was not made
public until 10 o'clock. Its receipt sent
a thrill of pleasure through the circle
of officials who have long awaited such
a communication. The news is just
reaching the general public and it is
expected that the day will bring ample
evidences of popular joy.
Except the barest announcement of
the receipt of General Noel's telegram,
nothing is known about the terms or
conditions proposed. The fall of Wan
tai, popularly known as Signal Hill.
FRIEND OF THE RUSSIAN
POPULACE IS DEPOSED
Czar Nicholas Said to Have Accepted
the Resignation of Prince
Sviatopolk-Mirsky.
LONDON, Jan. 2.âA dispatch to
the Standard from St. Petersburg says
it is reported with great positiveness
there and in Moscow that the resigna
tion of Prince Sviatopolk-Mirsky as
Minister of the Interior has* been ac
cepted by the Czar. It is expected
that a reactionary will be appointed
to succeed him, possibly General*
Kleigels, at present Governor of Kieff,
Pcdolia and Volhynla.
Lindequist May Not Accept.
BERLIN, Jan. I.âOn account of the
reported determination of the German
Government to separate the civil from
the military government of Southwest
Africa, Herr yon Llndequist, Consul
General at Cape Town, who was select
ed to succeed Colonel Leutweln, prob
ably will refuse to accept the Gov
ernorship. Herr yon Llndequist be
lieves that complete authority is essen

RHEIMS, Jan. I.âCardinal Bene

following the loss of Rlhlung. Sungshu.
"H" fort and new Panlung, is regard
ed here as a clear indication that the
Port Arthur garrison has lost its power
of serious resistance.
It is probable that the back of the
Russian defense was broken when 203-
Meter Hill was captured. The Rus
sians desperately sought to retake that
eminence and sent infantry and ma
rines against it in a series of futile
counter attacks.
BLOCKADE LIVES DIMINISHED.
Port of Dalny May Be Opened to For
eign Shipping.
TOKIO, Jan. L âA proclamation,
signed by Admiral Togo, which was
Issued to-day, diminishes the lines of
the Port Arthur blockade. The new
line of blockade commences at the
south head of Talien Bay and runs
northwesterly, clearing Dalny, to tho
south head of Society Bay. All the
Liaoti peninsula westward of this lino
is included in the blockade. The nar
rowing of the line is evidently intend
ed to open Dalny to foreign shipping,
but for the present only those vassels
having special permission are admit
ted. The new line of blockade was
made effective to-day.

NEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA
PRECAUTIONS TAKEN
LEST KINIRY ESCAPE
Jailers Will Not Allow Unknown
Visitors to See Him, *'
Fear Prisoners Pals Plan His Escape
. OAKLAND, Jan I.âFearful that an
attempt may be made to rescue David j
Kiniry, who is awaiting trial for the
murder of Policeman James H. Smith, )
his jailers at the County J.iil havej
.â¢ tr.ken special precautions against ad
mission of any person to see the pris- j
oner who is not known to his custo- |
dians. The rule has been made that J
persons applying for entrance to the '
jail after nightiall shall not be re
ceived unless they are properly identi
fied.
Night Jailer Percy White has seen
suspicious appearing men hanging
about the jail, and has expressed him
self as satisfied that there is something j
wrong.
< 'oncerninc his suspicions White said
to-day that he had made up his mind
that hot a loophole would be left open |
for a possible escape or rescue of
Kiniry. He added:
Not a man see Kiniry after nightfall. !
"If he has any pa's that might be ]yinÂ»; around j
for chance to get tstufT into the jail or to got at
hits, in any way they will b.- baffled. 1 don't like !
ttv- looks ft things and have taken care that j
nothing shall go wrong. Of course. 1 am not
prepared tn put my hand on anything specific,
but in . !<.sing down tightly on this man 1
shall frol Fafer.
White has been on his guard for
â¢ months against possible attempts at
â â¢ rescue of prisoners, because of the ex
' posing and frustrating of a plot that
was hatched in the jail by George J.
Dunbar and John Smith, desperate ex
convicts who had been convicted of
burglary. Dunbar, who had served
; seven terms in State penitentiaries, had
.been sentenced to twenty-five years'
imprisonment at San Quentin, and was
taken there a few days before his pal
STRIKES ROCKS
AND IS INJURED
Steamship Lakme, Lumber
Laden. Meets With Disaster!
at Mouth of Humboldt Bay
Special Dispatch to The Call.
EUREKA, Jan. 1 âThe Charles Nel
son Company's steamship Lakme, Cap- j
tain Carlson, bound for San Pedro j
from Eureka, struck on the north jetty :
-.at .the entrance to Humboldt Bay at
I .o'clock this morning and had a nar- !
row escape from total destruction. The '
buoy at the entrance had shifted and i
to this fact is due the disaster.
. The vessel, which carried a full car
go of lumber, struck upon the rocks at
the end of the north jetty. Her rudder
post and rudder were carried away, the
wheel MM injured and a large
. hole torn in the bottom. The vessei
*â¢ being unmanageable drifted across the |
entrance to the bay and would have
'â¢ gone or the north jetty and become a
- total loss, but the anchor was dropped
and she was kept off the rocks.
Distress signals attracted the life
â¢â¢aving station officials, who telephoned
to Eureka for a tugboat, and then hur
ride to the distressed ship in the life
.. boats. Meanwhile big breakers carried
away the deck cargo and the vessel ]
..-.became waterlogged. The captain and ;
crew were in great danger as seas ;
were constantly breaking over the I
â¢steamship. The tug Ranger and the
" life savers arrived in good time and
.' â¢the tug got a line to the Lakme, but I
â  the hawser parted as soon as a strain I
â¢ .'was put on it. With great difficulty
-a. second line was made fast to the i
vessel and a second pull moved the ,
."Lakme and got her out of danger.
NEW CRUISER CHATTANOOGA
MAKES SPEED REQUIREMENT
'â¢â¢ On Second Trial She Exceeds Contract
of Sixteen and a Half
Knots.
â¢' 'NEWPORT, R. L, Jan. I.âThe pro- j
tected cruiser Chattanooga completed
her two days' gpaed trial to-day, aver
â¢ aging between 16.1 and 16.;i75 knots per
hour over the measured mile course
' in Narragansett Bay yesterday and
. 16:605 knots per hour in a four hours'
'speed run off shore to-day. The Chat
tanooga was built to make 16.5 knots
â¢ per hour.
The measured mile test yesterday
was over the bay course off James
â¢ town, where torpedo boats are tested,
and the Chattanooga went over the
course many times, finishing late last
night.
. .Shortly before noon to-day the crui
ser started out of the bay for a four
â¢ hours' speed trial from Brenton Reef
lightship, during which she averaged
above her designed speed, making
16.605 knots per hour.
To-morrow the Chattanooga will
start on her final trip, an endurance
run of 24 hours, during which she will
fire her guns singly and in broadsides,
be run in a seaway and put thnough
. her paces generally.

druggist will return your money.
Smith was sentenced. About that time
White overheard Smith say: "They'll
never get me to San Quentin."
The prisoner was taken out of hia
cell, stripped and his clothing and cell
furniture were searched. In a carefully
hidden spot was bruught to light a
package of red pepper. White believes
the stuff was to be thrown in the jail
er's eyes when the time came for the
break. He connects a visit of two men
to the jail at 2:30 o'clock in the morn
ing with the plot. One of the callers
demanded to be let in to examine the
rogues' gallery of criminals' photo

WILL EXTEND
IONE RAILROAD
Promoters Plan to Build
Line From Sutter Creek
Into the Lumber Kegions
Special Dis-pat.-h to The Call.
SUTTER CREEK, Jan. 1 âThe lone
and Eastern Railway Company is to
extend its line from Sutter Creek back
into the timber regions. This company
is now constructing a line from the
terminus of the Southern Pacific at
lone to the mining towns of Sutter
Creek and Jackson. The line is more
than half completed, and will be in
operation soon.
Since construction began on the lone
and Eastern road, D. A. McCall, a
prominent citizen of lone, has asso
ciated with him the Holt Bros, of the
Holt Manufacturing Company of
Stockton and, to all appearances, the
A. B. & A. L. Stone Company of Oak
land, foj' the purpose of building a rail
toad from the mining towns back into
the timber regions. This project also
tarries with it the operating of saw
mills and a general wood and lumber
business.
While McCall and his associates were
engaged in examining the route Jack
son Dennis, the general manager of the
lone and Eastern road, ordered his en
gineers to commence vie survey for his
road, and he has stated that ground
will be broken in a very short time.
When Dennis applied for a franchise
he also secured a franchise allowing
him to construct a railway in any part
of the county.
The Dennis line is to run from Sutter
Hill, a point near Sutter Creek, as di
rect as possible, past Pine Grove and
Volcano to where fine timber abounds.
To Amador County the construction
of this road is of vast importance.
When completed and in operation it
will give employment to more than one
thousand men. As it is at present the
imjnÂ«nse amount of lumber and timber
of all kinds needed for the mines is
shipped up from San Francisco. When
this railroad is completed such will
not be the case, for there are vast
quantities of timber back in the moun
tains which ran be used in the mines
and furnished at a price less than what
Is charged in San Francisco-
The compan*/ will also develop the
vast deposits of tine maple known to
exist in the vicinity of Volcano, twelve
miles from Sutter Creek.
J. Sparrow Smith, a Sacramento
banke'-. proposes to build an electric
line from Sacramento to Sutter Creek,
past Elk Grove and through the rich
valley of the Cosumnes River. The in
centive for this road is the construction
of the lone and Eastern Railroad.
When this road is completed from lone
the large amount of business which
now goes to Sacramento will, naturally
enough, go to Stockton, and the people
of Sacramento wish to put a stop to
this.
An application for a franchise has
already been made to the Sacramento
County Suoervisors by Smith.
The people of Amador County are in
deed highly elated over the building of
two railroads and the prospects of a
third.
Carry the News to Roosevelt.
During the dying months of the old
year the census of the Mission was
notably increased and the honor of
the Police Department magnified.
Four healthy, bouncing babies were
added to the households of Policemen
William King and Tim Connell of Cap
tain Anderson's command. King
astonished the members of the force
when he announced that he was the
proud father of a boy and a girl, twin
babies. Tim Connell heard the an
nouncement, but said not one word un
til the week ending the old year, when
he walked into the station and per
mitted his comrades to congratulate
him on being on all fours with King.
The staff at once proceeded to make
up a purse which was invested in du
plicate presents for the little strangers.
Who will be next? is the query that
now presents itself to the married
members of the police force.

POLICE INVESTIGATION
Free Shooting at Early Morn
Leads to Finding of Two
Leaden Balls in a Dwelling
Oakland Office San Francsco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. L
The crashing: of pullets through their
bedroom at 2 o'clock this morning
awoke Mr. and Mrs. O. H. Peterson of
721 Market street. Whence came the
leaden missiles, one of which plowed
across the slumbering couple's bed and
lodged behind them in the wall, the
police to-day have been trying; to ascer
tain.
Mrs. Peterson was first awakened by
the bullets' sound, one shot following
another, until three explosions had
been heard. She aroused her husband
and they made a hurried Investigation.
The first bullet, one of large caliber,
had plowed through the rear of the
house, and was found in the wall. An
other ball, smaller than the one in the
bedroom, was stopped by an awning
over a porch at the back of the house.
No bullet was found to correspond with
the third shot fired.
Peterson reported the occurrence to
Police Captain Wilson, saying:
I cannot explain why we should have been
made targets for a pistol. We have no ene
mies that I know of and are on the best of
terms with our neighbors. The shots were
fired into the house, that is a certainty, and
the bullet that came lrto the bedroom showed
by the point of entrance and place where it
lodged we were in range as we slept.
The police are not sure whether the
shooting was done maliciously or by
some careless celebrator of the new
year's advent. Peterson takes the less
bothersome theory that an overjoyous
citizen made belated and unceremo
nious use of dangerously loaded weap
ons. The different sizes of the bullets
show that more than one pistol was
fired.
READY TO STOP
LAWSON'S RAID
Financiers Form Plans to
Meet His Attack on the
Market Expected Tuesday
Special Dispatch to Hie Call.
BOSTON. Jan. I.âlt was learned to
day that plans have been made by the
Standard Oil-Amalgamated Copper
group of financiers, which Thomas W.
Lawson calls "the system," to balk his
next attack upon Amalgamated Cop
per and other stocks of the Standard
Oil group, which he has announced for
next Tuesday. Lawson stated that he
wouTd have another big advertisement
in Tuesday morning's papers, and the
big Wall street group, taking him at
his word, has fixed up a deal to defeat
his scheme and pour millions into the
market to bolster up the stock in a
way that will discredit him forever, if
possible, by preventing any serious
break.
Proof that Lawson is feared as a dan
gerous enemy through his ability to
spoil plans for a rise in prices was seen
yesterday in the way "the system"
rushed to the support of "Amalgamated,
which it is believed is to be the object
cf his attack.
United States Steel and Rock Island
are understood to be weak points, and
the financiers responsible for the mar
keting of these stocks were busy all
day yesterday planing to repel the ex
pected attack on Tuesday. It is under
stood that J. P. Morgan has instructed
his brokers to protect United States
Steel from going ,to smash at the cost
of his entire fortune if necessary,
though it is not believed that he will
interfere if there are only small reces
sions in prices.
This public announcement of Law
son's intended move took away the
breath of veteran operators and has left
them with the uneasy feeling that he
may break out in some other unexpect
ed stock.

Their Hats Betrayed Them.
Through the sagacity of Policemen
Cornelius and Mitchell four crap play
ers were caught Saturday night as a
result of their own foolishness in
claiming their head gear. The patrol
men surprised the "sports" shooting
craps at Linden avenue and Buchanan
street under a street lamp. On the
approach of the police the quartet
broke and ran, leaving their hats be
hind. These trophies were seized and
taken to police headquarters with in
structions to hold the claimants should
they call to redeem their headgear.
This ruse worked to a charm. Book
ing Clerk Young invited each hat
claimant to fit the "tile" to his heal
before leaving the City Hall Police
Station. This the fellows did and
were then promptly booked on the
charge of shooting craps. Their names
were registered in the following or
der: Peter Enright, V. L. McPhun,
Thomas MeDermot and John Roach.
CLERK LOSES
MONTH'S WAGE
Southern Pacific Employe Is
Relieved of His Salary
by Two Daring Footpads
BERKELEY THUGS BUSY
W. H. Bishop Encounters
Desperadoes While on His
Way Home at Midnight
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center Street, Jan. 1.
One month's salary, amounting to
$90, earned by W. H. Bishop, has gone
to swell the purses of two footpads,
for whom Marshal Kerns of Berkeley
has searched during the last twenty
four hours in vain. Bishop, who is a
clerk in the Southern Pacific freight
office in San Francisco, was held up
and robbed last night at about 12
o'clock on Ashby avenue, near Ellis,
in South Berkeley.
The revelry in San Francisco on
New Year's eve detained Bishop until
much later than his usual hour tor
returning to his home at 1527 Mason
street, in Berkeley. He was alone when
he left the train at Ashby-avenue sta
tion. A few blocks from the railroad
he met on Ashby avenue the two foot
pads, who relieved him of the greater
part of his month's salary.
"I thought they were joking at
first," said Bishop, "when they called
to me to throw up my hands. 1 sup
posed probably they were New Year's
eve roysterers and I hurried on past
them, or tried to. They called again,
however, and one seized me, holding a
pistol close to my face. They were
masked and from their nervousness I
judge they were not veteran criminals.
They did not touch my watch or any
other article 1 wore, seeming to be
content with the moneyâmy monthly
salaryâthey took from me. When
they had taken the gold they ordered
me to walk fast for a block and not to
turn around under penalty of being
shot. I obeyed and when I did turn
around they hrd disappeared."
SCOTCH FOLK
FILL THE KIRK
St. Andrew's Society Meets
in Large Body to Worship
on the New Year's Night
There was a great gathering of
Scotch-born folk at the service at the
First Presbyterian Church last night.
It was under the iuspices of St. An
drew's Society. The Rev. "William Kirk
Guthrie preached the sermon, and the
beautiful singing was under the direc
tion of Otto Fleissner, the organist and
choir director.
The Rev. Mr. Guthrie said in part:
Among all the gatherings of the Scotch peo
ple tn SBn Francisco It has seemed fitting to
some of us that there is one place, at all
events, where once a year they should meet
together, and that Is tn the kirk, which has
occupied such a conspicuous place in Scottish
life and history. Wt know that the influence
and position of Scotchmen In the affairs of
the world to-day they owe mainly to that
curly training which brouxht them up to that
iwisition which, to quote the words of John
Knox, "They fear God so much that they fear
nought else."
Every country has its patron saintâthe
saint of England. St. C.eorge; St. Imvid of
Wales; St. Patrick of Ireland.
Bt. Andrew was one of the first apostles of
our Lord. We 'earn most about him from the
cosp'l of St. John.
When Jesus had returned from the tempta
tion he was pointed out to his followers by
John the Baptist as the Lamb of God. At
once Andrew, drawn by some majesty in his
presence, left John and followed him.
Scotland has done much for the world in the
way of bringing men to Jesus. The work be-
Eun so long ago has been carried forward to
our own day. and whose heart does not thrill
with pride as he recalls the life and work of
Morrison and Burns In China, of Alexander
Duff in India, of Moffatt. Livingston and Pat
ton. MacKenzie and MaoKay in Africa? And
our glory shall lie i' we, too, shall be found to
be following St. Andrew as faithfully as ha
followed Christ.
SERVICES IN ART GALLERY.
Evangelical Lutheran Chnrch Choir
Renders Beautiful Music.
Impressive services were held last
night in the Art Gallery of the Me
chanics' Pavilion by the Evangelical
Lutheran Church. A large chorus un
der the direction of Carl Sawvell ren
dered a beautiful programme. Ser
vices will be held in this hall by Evan
gelical Lutheran Church on Sunday
evenings.
The chorus contained about fifty
voices and the solemn music given
rang out with melody. A large gath
ering of worshipers joined in two of
the selections.
Rev. E. Nelander preached. He
used for his subject, "Which Church,
If Any?" In part he said:
We have just entered the sates of the new
year. The cradle of 1905 is being rocked on
the grave of 11)04. The new year to us Is yet
a child of duty and promise. There Is no real
difference between these days and any other
days. The sea bears no traces of the equa
torial belt, yet the marines know when they
are crossing the line and remember It to the
day of their death. While compliments of the
year are exchanged and salutations heard on
every side, the churches of Christ also salute
you. The church is a divine Institution, which
presents the benefit of testimony. The church
ought to be a Christian church, a cheerful
church, a comforting church, a church abreast
of the times, a singing church and a church
proclaiming the same old truths.

Alameda City Electrician
Summons Help to Protect
the 3lunicipal Light Works
QUARREL OVER FIREMAN
Superintendent Stands by
Discharge of an Employe
Who Disputes Authority
ALAMEDA, Jan. I.âThe assistance
of the police was called in to discharge
an employe of the Municipal Electric
Light Department this morning, this
marking the first conflict that has
arisen in the department since the ap
pointment of the City Electrician, J.
B. Kahn.
E. Duffy, a fireman at the plant, was
notified by Chief Engineer J. O. Messer
last night, after a consultation with
Mr. Kahn, that his services were no
longer required. Duffy replied that he
would take discharge only from Presi
dent J. F. Forderer of the City Trus
tees Kaiin was appealed to and he
upheld Messer's action, when Duffy an
nounced his intention of continuing his
work, any way. The police were then
called and Duffy subsided.
Concerning the trouble, Mr. Kahn
said to-day:
I propose to uphold the Chief Engineer of
the plant, regardless of the poliUcal pull some
of the employes of the department have. Duffy
seemed to think that his friendship for some of
the members of the Municipal Hoard would
permit him to override my authority, but they
will have to discharge me before he can go
back to work, as he was discharged for just
cause. And I have no doubt but that all the
City Trustees will uphold me in this action,
as the improvement of the working force of
the plant Is Just as essential to its proper
working as Improvement in the machinery.
UNIVERSITY ICONOCLASTS
ATTACK OLD PIPE STYLES
Short. Curved Stem Briarwood May
Give Place to Innovation of
Weird Design.
BERKELEY, Jan I.âFour of the
most prominent men in the university
have inaugurated a quiet campaign
to overthrow the time-honored tradi
tion cherished by college men in favor
of the short, curved stem pipe of com
merce, which has been the sort of
pipe affected by university men for so
long a time that the memory of man
runneth not to the contrary.
Each of these men is at the State
University now, although thousands
of the students of the university ros
ter are at home.
The men referred to are "Gus"
Keane, a senior, editor of the Uni
versity Occident; Walter de Leon, th*
junior who wrote the successful junior
day farce, "Just About Now;" Edwin
Rust, an amateur actor and assistant
yell leader, also a junior, and Emil
Kruschke, who quit the university iv
his junior year to engage in literary
and dramatic work, but still haunts
the campus.
These four men appeared to*lav
wearing pipes of new and strange de
sign. They created a sensation on
the campus and where college men
most do congregate. Their new
are calculated to make a loyal alum
nus wonder at the audacity of the
innovators. Instead of a curved stein
the four iconoclasts have had made to
order horizontal stems, and the bowl
of the pipe, instead of standing a bit
above the stem, is on a level with il,
so that the daring students seem to
be smoking out of small, elongated,
brier wood gourds.
Hitherto Keane, Kruschke, De Leon
and Rust have been regarded las
among the most loyal upholders of
college traditions. It is believed that
they have chosen the present time to
introduce the revolution in college
pipe styles in order that the interim
between university activities may en
able them to become accustomed to
the new pipes, and incidentally fortify
themselves against the wave of wratn,
indignation and grief that may be ex
pected when the full body of under
graduates comes back to Berkeley
from the happy holidays at home.
BAY CITIES REPLIES
TO OPEN CRITICISM
Sends Letter to the Officials of Oak
land Touching Questions Raised
Concerning Its Water Project.
OAKLAND, Jan. 1. âThe Bay Cities'
Water Company to-day sent to each
member of the City Council and Board
of Public Works a circular letter in
reply to a statement of opinion re
cently published by W. H. Chickerlng
in which the Bay Cities' project was
unfavorably criticised. The company
replies to the two main points upon
which its plan was attacked. The
first âthat of its physical featuresâ
the company says has been answered
by the favorable report of the Board
of Engineers to the City Council.
The second is the legal aspect,
which the corporation asserts is met
by its agreement to accept any form
of contract the city may desire and
by its agreement to furnish a bond
in (1,000,000 to fulfill the terms of
the contract. The company has re
quested the City Council to appoint a
committee to confer in the matter of
the contract.
CELEBRATES NEW YEAR
WITH LOADED CARTRIDGES
Life of Myron H. Fish of Alameda
Endangered by Careless
Use of Pistol.
ALAMEDA, Jan. 1. âThe practice
of welcoming the New Year with the
discharge of fire arms came near end
ing in a fatality in Alameda last
night. Myron H. Fish, who was await
ing the advent of 1905 in his residence
on the corner of Fountain street and
Encinal avenue, was startled by a bul
let which crashed through the wall of
the house and whizzed past his ear.
Another followed in a few seconds,
and Mr. Fish, convinced an attempt
on his life was being made, telephoned
to the police station.
An officer who investigated found
that F. E. Green, a commercial travel
er living at 1205 Peach street, had
done the firing. He was scarcely less
frightened than was Mr. Fish when
he learned that instead of firing blank
cartridges, he had been sowing bul
lets about town.
FIRST BURGLARY OF NEW YEAR â
ALAMEDA. .lan. I.âThe new year was com
menced for the Nuhrenberg family, living at
2i::t; Pacific avenue, by the robbery of their
residence by burglars who effected an en
trance by cutting through the screen over a
rear door and breaking the glass, then turn
ing the key, which had been left Inside. A set
of sliver spoons, a mirror, clock and manicure
set were taken. The family was at a neigh
bor's attending a "watch party" when ths
theft was committed.
BANNER YEAR
COMES TO END
Oakland Real Estate Dealers
Pleased With the Record
of Last Twelve Months
PROSPERITY CONTINUES
Condition of the Market
Indicates That Present
Activity Is Permanent
Oakland Office Ban Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 1.
The close of 1904 marks the end of
the most successful year for real es
tate dealers since Oakland was only
a collection of shanties on the east
shore of the bay, a time when the set
tlement here had not even a name.
The year has seen larger sales of prop
erty, more building of homes and a
greater demand for houses for rent
than ever before in the history of
the city, and all these things clearly
prove Oakland is growing, both as a
commercial and a residence center.
The two most important factors in
the progress of the city during the
year have been, first, a steady influx
of capital from ihe Northern and East
ern States, which has been invested
In Oakland property, and second, the
continued prosperity of the older resi
dents of the city, which has enabled
many people who have heretofore
lived In rented houses to purchase
property and build homes of their own.
Not only has the year been a pros
perous one for Oakland, but Berkeley,
Alameda and other suburban towns
have had a full share in this pros
perity. Large tracts of suburban prop
erty, which at the beginning of the
year were entirely vacant, have been
subdivided and built up with cottages
and villas. In most of these tracts all
the street work has been completed,
sidewalks and sewers laid and in many
cases ornamental trees have been
planted, transforming the previously
barren tracts into veritable parks.
DEMAND FOR BAY FRONTAGE.
The efforts of the Board of Trade
to obtain much needed improvements
for Oakland harbor and the likelihood
that these efforts will be successful have
given an added stimulus to the previ
ously large demand for manufacturing
sites along the shores of the harbor.
Since the committee sent to Washing
ton by the Board of Trade to confer
with the Congressional Committee on
Rivers and Harbors returned with the
report that a large appropriation was
likely to be granted to Oakland many-
Eastern manufacturers have made in
quiries as to the prices and locations
of manufacturing properties abutting
or. the estuary.
Among the important suburban
tracts recently placed on the market
is the Bayside tract in Alameda. This
is on Bay street, near San Antonio ave
nue, and contains forty-eight lots, each
T.OxISO feet. The tract is in the hands
of the E. D. Judd Company. Mr. Judd
says of the tract: .
The Rayside tract has never before bÂ»en
available, having been held by the former
owner for nearly forty years. The streets on
which all the lots In the tract front have al
ready been sewered and will at once be mao
aadamUed and finished with stone gutters.
Palm trees will be planted along the aide
walks. There are from one to three liveoak
trees on each lot. The tract has already
)>eon subdivided and aeveral of the lota have
been sold.
The ytar has been most prosperous and I
expect that the present year will prove even
more So. There Is a steady demand for resi
dence property in Alameda and the inquiry
for houses for rent Is also very brisk.
GOOD YEAR IX ALAMEDA.
The Alameda Land Company reports
that the year has been one of continued
activity, and expresses the confidence
that 1905 will prove even a better year.
Hally & Co. of Alameda have a num
ber of almost new residences in their
charge at present. They report the best
year's business ever experienced in the
Island City.
A. R. Denke has Just placed on the
market several blocks of choice resi
dence property, all of within
a short distance of the railway lines
and electric cars.
The E. P. Vandercook Company re
ports all the business that could be at
tended to by a full office force, and
Secretary A. F. Cornwall says there is
no doubt that the present year will wit
ness a large increase In the sales of
property to newcomers.
E. J. Stewart says that the business
of each month of the last year has been
larger than that of any month in any
year since he has been in business In
Oakland. Mr. Stewart now has on hand
a number of fine residence sites in all
parts of the city, both improved and
unimproved.
Charles C. Hulbert, successor to
Frank P. Lee, reports a steady demand
for residence property and also for all
kinds of houses for rent.
J. H. Macdonald & Co. report recent
sales of property aggregating $85,000 in
value, including the Stevenson tract of
eighty acres in Fruitvale.
Taylor Brothers & CO. report the fol
lowing sales during the month:
To F. C. Admiston of Greenfield. Ohio, a
lot 50x100 of business property on Sixth street
near Broadway; the price was $7500. To Ed
mund Maddock, a lot on West street, 25x100
feet, for (2200; to J. A. Johnson, five lots In
Tuxedo Park, East Oakland, for $2000. To
A. E. Waters, a lot on Chestnut street near
Twenty-eighth street, 4ttxl32 feet. A resi
dence corner to J. W. Kinney. Two lots to
Mrs. Mary C. Smith. A. lot to R. Thierkof.
Three lots to Mrs. Emma S. Rugg, Mrs. Nina
Mlelson and P. W. De Lancy. respectively.
William J. Laymance of the Lay
mance Real Estate Company says
that while the year has been one of
the best In the history of Oakland
the coming twelve months will be
even more prosperous.
SAN LEANDRO AND HAYWARDS.
San Leandro and Haywards have re
ceived their share of the real estate
business of the year, and dealers in
these places are confident of a con
tinuation of the present prosperity. In
San Leandro, the buildings erected in
1904 aggregate a value of $89,350
Twenty-four new houses have been
built.
Improvement work of all kinds, in
cluding building and street improve
ments, have marked the year in Hay
wards. Much of this improvement has
been due to the continued efforts of
the well known real estate firms of
Haywards. which have worked unceas
slngly for the betterment of the town
These progressive firms are p wil
bert and Rammage & Stanton Both
report excellent business during the
past year, with indications of even
greater prosperity to come.
The Piedmont District Improvement
Club, whose headquarters are at Oak
Chapel, Piedmont, has elected the fol

SANTA PAULA DRIFTS
HELPLESS OVER BAR
Current Sends Her Toward Seal Rocks
â¢ The barge Santa Paula had a nar
escape yesterday from being
w recked in the Seal Rocks. She was
< oming into port carrying a big load
of lumber and in tow of the steamship
Whittier. The two vessels were just
fusing In through the Golden Gate
when the tow line suddenly parted.
\ strong ebb tide was running at the
;ime and this swiftly carried the San
ta Paula back over the bar in a di
rect line toward the Seal Rocks.
The Whittier at once put about and
headed for the open sea in chase of
. the helpless barge, which was rapid
y drifting toward the rocks. For a
lime it looked as if the Santa Paula
was doomed to destruction, but after
strenuous efforts on the part of the
officers and crew of the Whittier a
new hawser was finally made fast to
the Santa Paula, and she was hauled
away from her dangerous predicament
and towed into port.
Both vessels were lumber laden and
came from Ventura.
Brings Body of Weber.
The steamship Queen, which arrived In
port yesterday, brought the remains of Frank
W. Weber, the late chief steward of the big
steamer Minnesota. Weber died suddenly of
heart disease while attending to his duties
OS the Minnesota when that vessel was in
Seattle. He was very well known and highly
esteemed In this port. For many years he
was steward on the America Maru and was
very popular on the run between this port
and the Orient. He left thai Maru in Japan
and went to New York to go Into service
I n the Minnesota.
Previous to his connection with the Maru
he made a round trip on the steamship Sierra.
He was equally popular with the shore peo
ple and with the sea-going folks. He leaves a
young wife, to whom much sympathy is ex
tended by a big circle of acquaintances.
VI sber was hut 36 years old. Tho funeral
will take place to-day and the interment will
be at Holy Cross Cemetery.
Captain Cousin*, commander of the Queen,
sajs that as he was about to leave Puget
Sound the barometer suddenly fell and a
heavy storm suddenly started up, so he ran
into Neah Bay. where he waited for four
hourÃ until the fury of the gale had prac
tically subsided. The weather during the
voyaae down the coast was fairly good.
Loses Her Anchor.
The schooner Olga. from Mahukona. which
j\Â»s lying at anchor off Presidio Saturday
Sight, was .struck by a. sudden gale which
. < auswi her to strain so much on hur star
board anchor that the anchor stock iÂ«Â«rted. She
drifted down toward Alcatraz Island, and but
for the prompt action of <*anjtait\ Wildwick
In clearing away and dropping his jxirt an
â  hur the vessel would have been dashed up
on the rocks of the prison iFland.
Has a Rough Trip.
The steamship Columbia on her last trip
down the coast ran into a succession of heavy
.ales. Captain J. A. Brown of the steve
doring firm of Brown & McCabe of Portland,
">r.. was one of the passengers. He says that
In all his forty yrtirs' experience on this coast
he has never seen anything like the terrific.
Weather the Columbia encountered. The mo
ment she crossed the bar of the Columbia
River she ran into a hurricane. The seas
ran mountain higli and tossed the sturdy boat
around like a cockle shell. At one time the
wind was btowhsg at the rate of seventy-two
miles an hour. The sea was a seething mass
of foam and washed the steamer s decks from
nil sides.

Old Mother Earth has expressed her
self as displeased at sun spots or some
equally mysterious and disturbing ele
ment and has grumbled so much that
the outer crust of this particular part
of the globe has trembled until man
kind has wondered what has happened
to make the old lady so angry.
Half a dozen shocks of earthquake
were felt yesterday afternoon, and two
'of them were severe enough to remind
1 the frivolous New Year merrymakers
that there are more things in heaven
] and earth than are dreamed of in his
tin-horn philosophy. Very little dam
age was done by the temblors, except
that San Francisco was reminded, by
the partial unseating of the dome of
one of the south towers of the City
Hall, that, speaking of administra
tions, there were others.
The tower, which appears to have
been very poorly constructed, was not
damaged to such an extent that it can
not be repaired. It was shaken from its
base and leaned over toward the Lar
kin street side, but not sufficiently to
be detected except on close observa
tion. That there might be not the
slightest way for an accident left open
in event of another shock of a severe
nature, two policemen were stationed
near the tower to warn persons passing
that way to keep from under.
The temblors seem to have been felt
most severely in the Mission, accord
ing to the reports of the Weather Bu
reau. At first it was thought that the
ground undulations were due to the
explosion of blasts in the Southern Pa
cific cut-off, South San Francisco, but
the three or four mild temblors at 2:45
o'clock in the afternoon were followed
at 3:30 o'clooji by a hard shake that
lasted six seconds and was immediate
ly followed by a slight earth movement
that was barely perceptible. At 4:25
o'clock there was another sharp shock
lasting four seconds, and again at 7:58
in the evening a gentle reminder that
all was not well under the sod.
Several windows were broken in the
top stories of downtown office build
ings, and at Ingleside the crowds
thought an immense blast had been
fired, so sudden and jerky were the
shocks. In several of the churches
where afternoon services were in prog
ress there was consternation in the con
gregation. The wonder is that there
have been so many shocks. There is no
; record of such an extended series of
earthquakes in this section in the sci
â  entitle classifications of such matters.
At the City Hall two of the shocks
caused the building to creak and grind
in such a manner as to badly frighten
those who were in the corridors and
about the offices. The damage to the
south tower, it was said, was due to
faulty construction as much as to the
earthquake. The prison officials say
that the force of the quake seemed
very great on the ground floor, while
others who were on the top floors de
clared that while the shock was some
what severe they did not think it was
nearly so bad as the heavy earthquake
of five years ago.
On the water front the quake was
felt at the ferry depot, but the shock
was slight. The ferry building, how
ever, is built on a sunken cylinder pier
foundation on a springy mud bottom,
and earthquakes are never felt there
so severely as in other parts of the city, j
TEMBLORS ARE FELT
ACROSS THE BAY
Professors Say May Be Caused by
Subsidence of Bottom
of the Bay.
OAKLAND, Jan. I.âEarthquake
shocks in variety disturbed Oakland
to-day, ojfening with a light tremor at
10:30 this morning, which was almost j
imperceptible, followed at 3:30 o'clock
this afternoon by a sharp shake of
three seconds' duration and concluding
with a third temblor at 4:25 o'clock,
which quaked for one and one-half
seconds. Remarkable features attend
ed the phenomena about the bay this
New Year's day. While the delicate
needle tracings were clearly recorded
of each shock on the seismograph at
the Chabot Observatory in Oakland,
there was not a sign of disturbance
shown on the instruments at the Uni
versity of California machines, though
these were in perfect order, according
to Professor A- O. LeuÃchner. The
heavy shock that occurred this even
ing in San Francisco was not felt on
the east side of the bay. The trio of
temblors that sent the earth under
Oakland awry were all of a kind, with
the same direction, east to west. That
the day's seismic disturbances were not
entirely local is proved by the absence
of tremor in Oakland when the sharp
earthquake was experienced across the
bay this evening. During the last forty
days there have been more shocks rec
orded at Chabot Observatory than for
many years. Professor Charles Burk
halter, in charge at the observatory,
does not offer a definite theory of the
cause. Concerning the conditions and
to-day's he said:
"The first shock was a very slight
one, barely perceptible, being as 1 to
100. The second was as 60 to 100, occur
ring at 3:27:18 p. m., and the third at
4:26:18 p. m..was as 40 to 100 in in
tensity. These shocks, which have been
so unusually frequent, cannot be ex
plained, except upon the general state
ment that they are caused by a slip
ping of the earth's crust. Scientists
have many theories to offer, but abso
lute knowledge is lacking."
Professor Leuschner and Professor A.
C. Lawson of the University of Cali
fornia express the opinion that the
shocks about the bay are caused by
the subsidence of the bottom of the
bay. Such a theory would, they think,
account for the fact that the shocks
are felt mainly about the bay shores.
No damage was done !n Oakland.â

SILLY PRACTICAL JOKERS

Show l ight.
The hold-up of the occupants of an ,
automobile on the ocean boulevard j
lata Saturday night was in the nature
of a silly and dangerous practical joke j
played upon Benjamin Peckerman, j
drummer for a Arm at 125 Sansome
street. Detectives Taylor and Bun- I
ner. who were detailed on the case
early yesterday morning, were not long
in getting at the facts.
They met Peckerman in front of a ,
saloon at 16 Mason street and he told
them of the hold-up. He said the
other occupants of the automobile
were in the saloon. They were ques
tioned and confessed that it was all
a joke on Peckerman, because he al
ways boasted as to what he would do
if held up. Two other friends hirea
an automobile and it was arranged
that they wouM stop at a certain point
on the boulevard and play the robbery
act. It was intended to tell Pecker
man of the joke, but he ran so fast
that they could not catch up with him.
Peckerman laughed when he heard
tlieir story and said the drinks were
on him. His watch and coin were re
turned to him. No action was taken
by the police.

' PUBLICATION OFFICE THIRD AND MARKET STREETS, SAN FRANCISCO
MONDAY. . - JANUARY 2, 1906
BRILLIANT CLOSE OF THE YEAR.
THE year just closed proved a pleasant disappointment to th<
country, as it turned out better than expected and better thar
seemed possible at the close of the first half. In June the busi
'. ness of the nation was distinctly behind that of 1903 both in volume
â .*â¢ and profits, but as already mentioned a turn occurred at that time
.' and the improvement has continued ever since with the result thai
when the figures for 1904 come in it will probably be found that th<
â¢year made a better showing after all than 1903, "which was a first
class year in every respect. The excellence of 1904 may be at
.' -tributed to the remarkable abundance of money and the bounteous
. . crops, both of which encouraged the country, restored confidence in
Credits and assured a large movement in all sorts of merchandise for
.many months ahead.
The final fortnight of the year was noteworthy in that the usual
close of the year lull did not make its appearance. Instead we wit
nessed a' noteworthy liveliness in the retail holiday trade, low rates
for money and a general feeling of buoyancy throughout the country.
Such conditions are rare at the close of the year, which usually is a
dull period at best.
All current statistics and commercial returns indicate briskness
â¢in trade. The earnings of the railroads in December, as far as re
â¢ ported, were 7.2 per cent larger than in 1903. The bank clearings
.'for the closing week showed a gain of 17.6 per cent over the corre
sponding week in 1903, with all the important cities except Kansas
. Cityi'Ncw Orleans. Omaha and Milwaukee exhibiting gains. Boston
reports that the supply of wool unsold on hand is the smallest in
"'.fifteen years and that the total unsold stock of domestic wool in the
I'nited States is only 42.000,000 pounds, against 112.000,000 on the
preceding year, which is a bullish condition in this important staple.
*â¢ But the mills have bought very heavily during the past few months
*' and are carrying millions of pounds, but this causes no concern, as
woolen goods are advancing, owing to the upward tendency of raw
wool.
â¢ The cotton industry is not making as good an exhibit as wool.
:> The crop of 1904 was enormous, resulting in a sensational tumble in
.'prices, and raw cotton is now selling at or below cost of production.
. In-fact, with the exception of wheat, all the great crops turned out
heavily. According to the Government reports issued last week the
'â¢â  production of corn was 2.467,481,000 bushels, with a farm value on
. December t of $1,087,461,000: the wheat crop was 552,400,000
"'.'.bushels, with a farm value of $510,489,000: the oat crop was 895,
--.545,552 bushels and the cotton crop 11,971.477 bales, the values of the
last two crops being floating and not specific. But their very size
assures an enormous revenue from both.
The immense production of the agricultural regions of the
. country indicated by the above Governmental returns naturally im
parts a pronounced stimulus to general trade. It almost assures
â¢. another year of prosperity. Wall street has discounted this condi
. tiou by a marked increase in the value of railroad and industrial
â¢ shares during the past several months, and all the traders and finan
â¢ .-cial interests connected with the Stock Exchange are shouting "Good
â¢times ahead!" The legitimate trade of the country feels the effects
thereof and expands in sympathy, while the remarkable abundance
.of money renders collections easy and failures comparatively few
"and unimportant. The railroads see a large traffic ahead and plan
enormous expenditures fur betterments to meet this new business,
and the manufacturers, so timid six months ago. are now reopening
their mills in expectation of a further expansion in production. Labor
feels the influence of these conditions and, is fully employed at bet
ter wages than were thought possible half a dozen years ago. In
brief, the country has fairly outdone itself in prosperity, and the pre
dictions of the Republican party in the first McKinley campaign that
â¢ the establishment of the Republican policy would result in good
times have been more than realized. The "full dinner pail" has not
only been filled, but has been running over, and several times since
.that campaign the American stomach has become so stuffed and the
' American back so richly clothed that they have been obliged to pause
for rest and recuperation.
This is the commercial condition of the United States to-day.
It is brilliant. We are more than prosperous. We are lolling in
voluptuous profusion. The danger now is not that we shall be
hungry, but that we may be pampered by too high living. Even
prosperity contains within itself the elements of danger, and we must
beware of living too highly. Eat persons do not live as long as
lean ones as a rule. â¢
THE GROWTH OF OAKLAND.
BUSINESS men whose interests demand close observation' are
the highest authorities upon the present conditions and
prospects of any of our municipalities. Over in Oakland
business men have been taking the year's inventory of stock and
they find it good. Over their published names bank presidents, real
estate owners and the leaders in manufacturing interests have ren
dered conservative statements of the city's remarkable growth dur
ing the year past âstatements which bring conviction and arouse
interest in affairs across the hay. the State o^-er.
Probably the most tangible of all evidences of Oakland's pros
perity displays itself from the books of the census-taker. Since
the last national registering of citizens the roll of Oakland's resi
dents has increased by over 20,000 âa forty per cent increment to
the population of two years back. This sudden influx of home
seekers is reflected directly by the record of realty transactions
and the reports of the builders. The president of the Oakland Real
Estate Association vouches for the fact that the two years just
closed have witnessed a brisker business in building and manufac
turing properties than any like period in the city's history. In the
erection of new homes it'is estimated that $5,000,000 has been spent
during the year past.
The mercantile and manufacturing interests, which find a
thriving growth across the bay, register the increase of their busi
ness through the accounts of the banks and loan associations. The
manager of one banking house is authority for the statement that
the increase in commercial deposits and in the volume of exchanges
â has established a high-water mark in Oakland's banking business.
â¢The cashier of another institution places the increase in its business
twenty-five per cent over that of 1903. From the manufactories,
the shipbuilding plants on the estuary and the traction companies
like reports of good times are forthcoming.
It is a fortunate fact for Oakland that the city is in no manner
outgrowing itself. With all the extension of suburbs and the de
.velopment of the'older portions of town the machinery of the city's
government has kept pace. The Board of Public Works reports an
expenditure of $800,000 in improvements for the year past. This
â¢includes the sewering of outlying districts, the building of new
roads and the repairing of the old ones, notably Telegraph avenue.
For the erection of schools $900,000 has been appropriated. New
fire houses have been erected to protect the rapidly growing suburbs.
Iri short, in very direction Oakland is undergoing a remarkable ex
pansion and is rapidly making good the aspiration of being the
second city in the State.

DAN CUPID CAPTURES
"UNKISSED" PROFESSOR
ALJA R. CROOK, "the man who
never had been kissed," and,
incidentally, professor of min
eralogy and economic geology
at Northwestern University, is en
gaged to be married. Three years ago
and more he was heralded far and
near as "the man who never has been
kissed." When the news of his en
gagement became known his Evans
tor, friends changed the tense of the
verb, safs the Chicago Tribune.
To several of his fellow professors
he admitted his engagement, but as to
additional facts, even the name of his
fiancee, he has preserved what he en
titles a "discreet silence." All taken
into his confidence were warned not
to spread the news. Ever since the
professor's experience three years ago
he has shunned publicity, as at that
time he was the recipient of thousands
of letters questioning him as to the
veracity of his declaration that he
never had kissed woman or child. It
is said in Evanston, however, that the
future Mrs. Crook resides in Ohio,
where the professor spent his boyhood
and college days.
It was declared among the students
at the time Professor Crook "sprang
into fame" three ago that he
was engaged to marry a young woman
from Ohio, but that the ceremony was
postponed (o avoid publicity. It is
rumored that the projected wedding
Is the finale of that betrothal.
According to the story, Professor
Crook confided to his class of students
on April 26, 1901, information regard
ing his life: â¢
"I never have in my whole life
either drank, chewed, smoked, or
kissed a woman."
The report of Professor Crook's con
fession was at first confined to cam
pus gossip. There, however, it was ac
cepted as sincere, as he never had been
known to shield his opinions nor quib
ble with words. It produced a sen
sation. The professor was a bachelor
of 35. He never had been rated as
a woman-hater.
Professor Crook found in his mail
one day a clipping from a London
newspaper containing an editorial
tvhich attempted to mitigate the gen
eral wave of adverse comment on the
'kissing" question. At another time
le received notices which had crept
into the newspapers in Peking and
Calcutta.
BITS OF EARLY MORNING MERRIMENT
SURE THING.
Barnes Tormerâl played the villain,
â¢ and In the fourth act I had a mob after
me.
Knight StandâDid you make good?
I Barnes TormerâSure. I played the
' part so realistically that the audience
! Joined the mob.
PROFESSOR ALJA R* CROOK.
During the general discussion of his
personal affairs Professor Crook pro
tested and even denied the truth of the
story regarding his reported confes
sion.
"I cannot answer questions." he con
| siMently replied to his friends, "but if
it is true that this is the source of so
j much talk then indeed are we fallen
j upon degenerate times.
"I never have spoken to a class the
I words which have been attributed to
me. As near as I can find out, the
I genesis of the story is that I was talk
ing with a young man who had a repu
tation for being wild. I was deeply in
terested in him, as I am in every
young man or young woman who
comes before me as a student. I as
sured him of my deep solicitation for
his future if he persisted in the ways
he had adopted. He proceeded to
argue with me and even quoted
Luther:
Who IÂ»ve.Â« not women, v.me and sonj
Will live a fool his whole life long.
"I lost patience and told him he was
utterly wrong. He said that perhaps
if I were to look back and remember
some of my old school days I might
have a fellow feeling for him. This
called from me the remark that if he
were to follow me for a model he
never would drink, chew, lie, or flirt
with wonK-n. Afterward, I suppose,
this latter qualification was twisted or
construed into â¢kissing a woman.' "
Taking Xo Chances.
Two men in the West were to be
hanged for horse-stealing. The place
selected was the middle of a trestle
bridge spanning a river. The rone was
not securely tied on the first man to be
dropped and the knot slipped. The man
fell into the river and immediately
swam for the shore. As they were ad
justing the rope for the second man, an
Irishman, he remarked:
"Will yez be sure and # tfe that rope
good and tight, 'cause T can't swim."
Clothing of Ffafa Skins.
The Government Fish Commission
has been making investigations about
the suitability of fish skins for
clothing. It has been found that
salmon skins make excellent leather
and have been used for boots by the
Eskimos for this purpose for years.
These northern people also use tanned
codfish skins for coats and waterproof
garments. Whaleskin makes beautiful
leather and takes color well.

more than half of which goes into but
ter; one bushel of apples and two and
a half bushels of other fruits and ber
ries, three bushels of potatoes and two
bushels of carrots, beets, parsnips and
turnips; eleven head of cabbage and
half as much lettuce, cucumbers and
cauliflower; twenty-eight bushels of
corn, usually in the shape of beef, pork
and poultry, besides seventy pounds of
cotton, six pounds of wool for clothes
and enough leather for two pairs of
shoes, says the New York World.
These raw materials at present
wholesale prices would sell for about
$50. The size of the average American
family is five and a quarter, which
would make the family share of this
year's crop cost $262.
The bare necessities of life do not cost
so very much. What counts for more
in the total of expenditures are luxu
ries that have become necessities and
other luxuries that might better be
done without.
NOT A MaTIOOKED ON.
With not a man on the stage and
not a man in the audience, the stu
dents of the Baltimore Woman's Col
lege gave a performance of "Much
Ado About Nothing." in that city, the
other evening. Scene shifters, light
manipulators, musicians and ticket
takers all were women.
As for the acting, every character
is said to have been portrayed "with
grace and fine appreciation of the
poet's lines." Miss Cull, a Baltimore
girl, was Beatrice; and Miss Arohn
son, another Baltimore gfrl, Benedict.
Each was excellent. The only criti- \
cism made of MiÂ« 3 Nugent, who is
from Jackson, Miss., was the compli
mentary one that her beauty was "al
most too regal to become the gentle
Hero."
Satin and velvet naturally were the i
predominant materials, consistent I
with the period of the May. and two
costumes in particular won the ad- .
miration of the audience, which, be- |
Ing all feminine, was about as critical \
as might be imagined. These were a \
white satin worn by Hero
and one of pink satin that graced the
figure of the inimitable Beatrice. The
characters were not without jewels in
keeping with their era. either, for
beads of various hues were cleverly
arranged to imitate the stones that fit
ted the colors of each costume.
GRIT OF DOCTOR.
A sturdy seventeenth-century doc
tor who sometimes bluntly prophesied
the death of 1 is patients, and correct
ly, too, was the famous Dr. John Rad- j
cliffe, of whom Edmund Gosse writes
in the January Harper s under !he j
title "A Doctor to Kings." Dr. Rad- I
cliffe was physician to William 111.
doted on him until one day the doc
tor's grim candor was carried too far,
and he informed the King, "Why, tru
ly, I would not have your two legs for
your three kingdoms." The King ban
ished him from court, and as the
worthy doctor departed he predicted
the day of his angry sovereign's death
âa prediction promptly realized. He
also quarreled with Queen Anne, told
her "that her ailment was nothing
else but the vapors," and because she
nesented his independence declined to
attend her on her death bed. i

POKER âS. S., Oakland, Cal. In
the game of poker Hoyle lays down
the rule that a straight, sequence or
rotation, which is five cards following
tn regular order of denomination, as
ace, deuce, tray, four and five, and
the cards may be of different suits,
beat triplets or three of a kind. In
a straight the ace counts both ways,
but its value is different. When with
the king, queen, knave and ten it
makes the highest straight, but with
the two, three, four and Aye, the low
est. A later authority which sustains
this position says: "Straights are not
always played, but should be allowed
when desired. "This point must be set
tled prior to beginning of the game,
however."

The Entrances to Matrimony
and Lanes Leading From It
THE most conspicuous objects on
the horizon just at present are
the many "gateways to matri
mony" which are presented
to' our view by the oblig
ing press. They are more numer
ous than real estate signs on the ave
nues, and more inviting, some of them,
than Dowle's ornamental city gate at
Zion. With all this wealth of oppor
tunity before our eyes no unappro
priated blessing need despair. All that
any one of us has to do is to choose
a suitable vocation, and let fate do the
rest.
Almost every sphere of woman's work
appears to haveâif it is proper under
the circumstances to put it this wayâ
the refusal of matrimony.
One newspaper declares in big black
headlines that the girl who takes up
stenography is coquettishly daring
Cupid to shoot.
Another article would persuade the
reading public that a wedding, ring Is
at the disposal of any school teacher
who will hold up her left hand.
We are assured that the factory girls
have not one chance in a hundred for
single blessedness. Domestic schools
are apparently working overtime to
teach ingenuous maidenhood how to
concoct love philters.
Among men the grocers' clerks and
milkmen appear to have the matrimon
ial advantage. And army officers foot
the waiting list, heavily handicapped
by Major-General Corbin's practical
! dictum that no one of them may marry
j unless he can satisfy the Secretary of
War that he can buy his household
furnishings for oash, and not on the In
stallment plan.
Just beyond the entrances to matri
mony, crowding them, are other
edificesâthe gateways out of mar
riage. These structures all look much
alike; most of them are modern in
their architecture, with fine false
fronts of marble and plain backs of
common hrick.
This city of gateways, forced so per
sistently upon our notice, is evidently
intended to educate the public, just as
a world's fair is built to widen the
outlook of a people. It is meant to be
something more than a unique specta
cle; its purpose is equally to please
and to improve.
Let us be quite honestâis the exhi
bition a success? It is interesting, It
Is instructive, but aren't we paying
high for it?
How times have changed since our
grandmothers said "I will." How they
and their mothers would have blushed
to see the marriage bond, the most
sacred obligation of their put on
the bargain counter as now it is.
THE GOLDEN LEGACY.
mT mother had no gold to share.
Nor land nor herd nor mer
chandise.
(My brother has her silken hair,
My sister has her azure eyes!)
To me she left no comeliness
That to the face or form belong,
But, oh. one gift I do possessâ
The blessed heritage of song!
Long, long ago. in cradle days.
Her sweet voice would my heart be
guile.
When I could nothing do but gaze
Into the heaven of her smile!
City. Widows, according* to the eti
quette of this country, should wear
mourning for two years, and sometimes
it is never thrown off. Crepe and bom
bazine or Henrietta cloth are worn for
one year at least, longer if desired, but
that is the shortest period if assumed
at all. Then the widow's cap and long
veil may be thrown aside. The dress
may be of silk, less heavily trimmed
with crepe. The latter may be left off
at the end of eighteen months and
plain black be worn until the period of
two years is completed, when It may
be laid aside entirely or toned up with
the somber colors.

DOROTHY FENIMORE
In their time romance and sentiment
were cut off the piece for customers,
and not offered to the publio in rem
nant lots.
Was there not something beautiful
about the reserve of the older gener-
wuut
ation concerning matters of the affec
tions?
The bunch of old love letters which
I treasure in the secret drawer of my
ancestral desk, and which my great
grandmother wrote to my great-grand
father out of the sweetness of her
maiden heart, are models of propriety.
They might have been sent to any
man. But about their yellowing pages
there clings jthe tender romance of the
life she lived.
Only one matrimonial gateway was
open to herâthat of love; and only the
gateway of death led out of the re
lationship. The situation was to her
one which called ânot for gossip, not
for publicityâbut for a fine reserve
which made of life's deep experience a
shrine.
I learned the songs In later years.
And with her sang them o'er and o'er.
Oh, memory, thy lute and tears
Must meet and mingle evermore!
'Twai "Hush, My Babe"âas fades tha
light
I hear her softly, sweetly croonâ
Then "Afton Water," "Stilly Night.**
mctlsslma" and "Silver Moon."
Bin sang them with such tender artâ
The art that only mothers knowâ
And tied the tunes around my heart.

LAURA BRIDE POWERS
perpetuated in marble?
As to the first group of qualifications,
there is a vast array of choice, and
herein, good friends, is the great
and omnipresent opportunity for the
"knockers"âthey whose special purpose
in life seems to be to checkmate public
enterprises and to oppose all things pa
triotic, political or economic, unless
self-interest prompts support. But, fel
low Californians, now's the time to
checkmate the "knockers." So wake
up! The movement to place these
statues in Washington is now an issue.
It has been proposed by the Pioneer
Women, the Native Daughters and by
other patriotic bodies, and the matter
will be in the hands of the Legislature
ere many weeks. And it is said that
Senator George B. Keane, on behalf of
the Native Daughters, will introduce a
bill in the upper house for an appro
priation for these statues.
Just what the Pioneer Women will do
should the Native Daughters present
their bill first is problematical. But It
is hoped that, being good Californians,
they will stand by and lend a hand In
the name of good citizenship.
Now, who shall the great men be?
Here's the block upon which the anvil
of the "knockers" will ring.
The Pioneer Women's petition, circu
lated by them some time ago, asking
for support to the measure names Ice
land Stanford and Joseph Le Conte as
the men to be honored. Along come the
Native Daughters, who proclaim the
name of that first-Californian, Junipero
Serra, to be the only logical one.
Besides Junipero Serra, Stanford and
Le Cjnte, Thomas Starr King is pro
claimed as deserving of honor; like
wise Colonel Baker, General John Sut
ter, James Marshall and a few other
early Californians of renown.
Friends, a choice must be made, and
made before the bill comes up for con
sideration, else it will fail of passage
on its Incompleteness.
! That we may not place our State in
1 the embarrassing position of not know
i ing what she wants, get your thinking
I caps on and decide upon the men whom
J YOU think deserve recognition from
\ the State for their "distinguished ser
! vices or historic renown." And let the
' decision be free from politics, free from
j religion and free from race prejudice.
' Unless these unworthy factors be ellm

So the ghost will not down!
Up bobs the old story of taking
"mixed" clubs Into the State redera
tion. And the question is being agi
tated vigorously in Southern Califor
nia, where the plan seems to have
hosts of supporters.
Now, what type of club Is a woman's
club with men in it? Clearly the men
are interlopers. It ceases to be a wo
man's club, immediately upon the ac
quisition of men. And it's hardly com
plimentary to the men, methinks, to
be thus hauled in under sufferance.
And it's not believed that the men are
o'er anxious for admission.
But aside from these minor matters,
the adoption of the amendment to the
constitution of the State Federation
admitting "mixed" clubs, would, im
mediately operate to eject the Califor
nia State Federation from the National
Federation, which is distinctly an ag
gregation of women. Ltadies, how
would you like that?
Many of the northern clubs are gird
ing on their armor to put up a good
fight against the amendment. It prom
ises to be the interesting thing of the i
February* meeting in Los Angeles.
There's much commotion caused in
northern clubdom by the proposing of
Mrs. Joslah Evans Cowles for the next
State presidency, as many of the lead
ing clubs are stoutly In favor of the
re-election of Mrs. George Law Smith
whose tactful and diplomatic admin
istration is conceded to be the most
popular since the organization's birth.
Mrs. Evans is likewise aÂ«n immensely
popular woman, but the political wise
acres in clubdom prophesy the follow
ing year for a southern California

pose of distilling* alcohol from peat. The

able to distill alcohsl cheaper from peat
than it can be obtained from other sub
stances, and will, therefore, be able to
sell its product for fuel purposes.

CRACK PONIES WILL RACE.
Sensational Sport Promised To-Day on
Clark Track at San Mateo.

ing at San Mateo to-day under the
auspices of the California Polo and
Pony Racing Association. C. W. Clark's

man, to beat Fusillade. Charlie Dunphy
will have the leg up on Honama and
will take some beating.
R M. Tobin has purchased the good
race mare Ethel G, by Beaconsfield.

taken blue ribbons in the show ring.

terday and all qualified. One is a four
year-old owned by F. J. Carolan and
sired by Fusillade.
C. W. Clark's string of ponies have
been in the hands of Trainer Stanfield,
and they all look fit to race.

QUENTIN ROOSEVELT HAS
SMASH UP WITH HIS GOAT
Animal Leaps Down Steps, Dragging
the Wagon and the Presi
dent's Son.
WASHINGTON, Jan. I.âQuentin
Roosevelt is now satisfied with his
Christmas goat. The President's young
est son took his first drive behind the
j goat this afternoon. The butler, the
I White House policeman and others
were present at the start, but they
could not keep up with the procession.
The goat headed from the south por
tico of the White House toward the ex
ecutive offices, and put in his best licks.
â¢ The boy was delighted, but the goat
had not been trained to avoid preci
pices when tied to a wagon. He did not
turn into the drive, but made a leap
down the steps leading to the execu
tive avenue between the White House
grounds and the State, War and Navy
buildings. The goat, wagon and boy
landed in the street at the bottom of
the steps in a general mixup.
The policeman, the butler and a dozen
tourists rushed to the rescue. Quentin
scrambled to his feet and inquired if
the goat had been hurt. He paid no at
tention to the scratch across his own
face. He likes that goat.
COLLIER SUCCUMBS TO NOURSE ON
THE TENNIS COURTS
THE WINNER WILL MEET JANES
Rolfe and Schmidt Take Part
In the Longest Match of the Day
The annual class singles tennla tour
nament was started yesterday on the
California Club courts. Play was com
pleted down to the finals in the first
three classes and to the semi-finals in
the fourth class.
In the first class George Janes and
B. F. Nourse qualified for the finals.
The surprise of the day was the defeat
of W. B. Collier at the hands of Nourse.
The latter was beaten twice by Collier
in the continuous tournament and the
latter was expected to win quite hand
ily. Nourse put up his usual steady
game and won two straight sets. A
scarcity of the regulation ball made It
necessary to use another kind. Collier
attributes his defeat to this fact. There
is probably some merit in his claim,
although Nourse was as unused to the
balls as his opponent.
George Janes and Carl Gardner put
up a good exhibition. Gardner looked
to have Janes beaten when he won the
first set easily and led at 3-1 and van
tage. The pace told on him while
Janes, as usual, finished strongly and
just nosed his opponent out.
Harry Rolfe and Herbert Schmidt
figured in the longest match of the
day. Rolfe won the first set easily but
the work seemed to do Schmidt good.
He took the next set 9-7 but lost the
third by a 10-8 score. Schmidt is out
of practice. At his best he is probably
the best player In the class.
Rolfe's match with Schmidt left him
tired out and Janes beat him In
straight sets. Rolfe made a good bid
in the first set but could not quite win
it. He lost heart after this and Janes
took the second set easily.
In the second class both Ray Cornell
and Ray Splivalo defaulted. With these
two men out of it Melville Long looks
a sure winner. He beat Alexander
Beyfuss easily and also disposed of

CRASHES DOWN
SHAFT TO DEATH
Elevator Boy in the Phelan
Building Makes a Fatal
Mistake and Is Killed
CAGE CHEEPS UPWAED
Supposing the Car to Be on
Level With Floor, Youth
Steps Off Into Eternity
A moment's thoughtlessness, com
bined with carelessness In the manip
ulation of an elevator switch, cost John
C. Heuer his life in the Phelan building
yesterday afternoon. Heuer was 19
years of age and had lived at 1621 Stu
art street, Berkeley.
Heuer, who was operating the small
elevator, failed to turn the power en
tirely off, and not noticing that the
car had moved upward after he left it
stepped into the shaft and plunged
downward for five stories. When Dr.
Frederick W. d'Evelyn and others who
were summoned by the crash arrived
the unfortunate youth was breathing,
but he died in a few minutes.
It was the custom for the elevator
boy to run up to the fifth floor and sit
in the broad window seat on the west
side of the building overlooking Mar
ket street and there await any call.
Heuer probably ascended to the fifth
floor, shutting off the power, as he sup
posed, and stepping out of the car seat
ed himself at the window. In the mean
time, as indicated by the position of the
car and the governing switch, the pow
er was not entirely off and the car
crept upward.
In all probability, for no one was by
to witness the tragic death, Heuer re
sponded to a call, and coming out of
the blinding sunlight Into semi-dark
ness stepped into the narrow shaft to
his death. This idea seems to be borne
out by the finding of the young man's
hat pn the fifth floor, and it is thought
that the floor of the car knocked it
off as the man fell.
The sound of the crash caused many
persons to hasten to the shaft, thinking
the elevator had dropped. It was not
until the hat was found that a tragedy
was suspected. Peter Semenza, the
janitor, descended to the bottom of the
shaft and carried Heuer to the ground
floor. Before an ambulance call could
be sent in the man was dead and the
Morgue wagon was called.
Heuer was almost unknown in the
building, having worked only since last
Friday. In his pocket was found a
memorandum book with the Berkeley
address and an address <jf Pleasanton
Valley, El Dorado County, California.
A little money and an unused Berkeley
commutation ticket, together with a
few trinkets, completed the inventory.
An entry In the memorandum book
showed that he had visited a Dr. Ward
and that an elevator boy named George
Alpus in the Starr King building had
visited him. The body was taken to the
Morgue.
Heuer lived with his uncle, Edward
M. Chase, chief yeoman in the United
States navy, at 1621 Stuart street in
Berkeley. Chase said his nephew carse
from Pleasant Valley, in El Dorado
County, where his parents reside, a few
weeks ago. He was employed at Man
grum & Otter's until last week, when
Chase, who is stationed at Admiral
Glass' office in the Phelan building,
procured him a situation elevator
conductor there.

THIEVES LOOT DWELLING
WHILE FAMILY IS AWAY
After Celebrating the New Year the
Sarles Return to Find
Home Ransacked.
While L. Sarle and his family were
out celebrating the advent erf the glad
new year, thrifty and enterprising
burglars were collecting materials for
a celebration on their own account
from the Jewelry and clothing of the
Sarle family.
The Sarles live at 926 Larkin
street,, and the names of the successful
burglars are unknown. When Sarle
returned to his home in the early
hours of the new year, he found the
place had been ransacked. Bureau
drawers had been looted and the con
tents of closets and clothes presses
had been hastily tumbled about.
Upon investigation it was found
that the thief or thieves had taken a
watch and pin valued at $50 and $150
worth of clothing and trinkets. One
of Sarle's New Year's resolutions is to
buy a dog.

THINK FRIEND
MET FOUL PLAY
Maximilian Lipowitz, Assist
ant Storekeeper at the
Custom House, Disappears
CABBIES $300 AT TIME
Well-Known Man Who Has
Not Been Seen Since Satur
day Night Is Still Missing
Maximilian Lipowitz, assistant
j storekeeper in the United States Cus
i torn House, is missing and his friends
! fear that he has met with foul play.
Lipowitz has not been seen since yes
terday morning at 1 o'clock, when he
started for home after visiting friends
In the Hotel Metropole. He had be
tween $300 and $400 on his person and
jokingly remarked as he left for his
rooms that he might be held up.
Last night Mrs. Martha Stevenson,
whose husband Lipowitz was visiting,
called at the Central Emergency Hos
pital yesterday and reported the fact
of their friend's disappearance. Mrs.
Stevenson said that Lipowitz was not
a drinking man and that when he left
her husband's rooms he said that he
was going directly to his home In the
Monroe Hotel at 612 Bush street and
promised to call to see his friends
again yesterday morning.
When Lipowitz did not put in an ap
pearance at their apartments yester
day, Mr. and Mrs. Stevenson became
alarmed in view of the fact that Lipo
witz had such a large amount of
money on his person at the time he
departed, and had remarked that he
might be held up.
Inquiry was made at all the hos
pitals last night, without leading to
the discovery of the missing man. The
police were notified and detectives de
tailed on the case.
Lipowitz is a single man and has
held an excellent Government posi
tion for many years. He was well
liked by all who knew him and his
friends are mystified at his disappear
ance. They fear that he may have
been made away with after falling a
victim to thieves.
TAKING SHOWS
AT CALIFORNIA
AND ORPHEUM
The Road Show entered upon its
j second week at the Orpheum last
! night. The bill is materially strength
! ened by the addition of the Four
j Bards, the most daring and original
! tumblers that a San Francisco audi
; ence has seen in many a day. Some
jof the feats they performed seemed
| impossible, yet they managed to get
! away with them all save one feat
: which they tried five times, then
1 gave it up. The quartet works
I marvelously well together and every
i act they have is a new oneâsome
thing that interests the spectator. As
usual, Mclntyre and Heath and Clar
ice Vance reign supreme. The negro
impersonators have a new sketch en
titled "Dr. Breakbone." They rendered
it here two years ago. but it is so fun
ny that every one seemed glad to see it
once again. Miss Vance has a bunch
of new coon songs and she was called
out four times before the crowd was
satisfied and then it wanted just one
| more. The Latonas have a fresh sup
! ply of musical skits and Smirl and
! Kessner. Probst the great, the Mll
j linery Maids and Spessardy's bears
and ponies help to strengthen the bill.
"Yon Tonson," the ever Interesting;
and entertaining Play with the Swedish
hero, began a week's run at the Cali
fornia yesterday to good houses. David
Brattstrom, who follows Gus Heege In
the title role, is as good as that clever
originator of Swedish delineation and
dialect, if not better. In, addition to his
excellent Impersonation Brattstrom is
i a musician and introduces several vlo- j
lin specialties that are alone worth the
price of admission.
In the supporting company there are
a few weak spots. E. Guy Spangler
makes the most of a thankless genteel 1
heavy, and Harry Bond is entertaining
as the negro footman. Miss Marguerite
Fields is a very gifted woman, her \
grace and presence winning the audi
ence from the start. Violet Holmes was
acceptable as Grace Jennings, and
Hazel Harroun gave a clever imper- \
sonation of a boy's part.
VEREIN ARION MEMBERS
MAKE MERRY WITH SONG
Clubrooms of Society Are T#ronged
With Happy Folk, Who Gather
.at Annual Reception.
The members of the Vereln Arion,
the well-known German singing so
ciety, made merry with song and mel
ody yesterday afternoon at their head
quarters in Union Square Hall. The
event was the annual New Year's re
ception and was attended by more
than 250 members of the society.
The rooms were tastefully decorated
with a profusion of flowers and ever
greens. An attractive musical pro
gramme was rendered, including sev
eral selections by Miss Lulu Puelenky,
the popular contralto; the Herman
Quartet, consisting of J. V. Oppel,
Chris Heinz, H. Hackfeld and H. Mar
quardt. In addition the members of
the club sang several chorus selec
tions.
The address of welcome was deliv
ered by the president of the society.
Fritz Hagemann. Professor Albert
Putzker of the University of California
also made an address. President Ben
jamin Ide Wheeler of the university
was unable to be present and sent a
telegram expressing his regrets.
Little Girl Is Run Over.
Josle Hooper,, an 8-year-old girl,
living at 128% Sixth street, was run
over by a buggy at Sixth and Howard
streets last night and seriously Injured.
The child was playing on. the street
when a light vehicle, driven by two
men, dashed down the thoroughfare.
Before the little girl could get out of
the way two wheels passed over her
body. She was taken to the Central
Emergency Hospital, where Dr. Kucich
found that she was suffering from
painful bruises and contusions and
possible Internal injuries.

blamed Murray for the accident and
was so angry over the affair that he \
caused the latter's arrest on a charge j
of malicious mischief. Murray af

NEW YEAR'S DAY
GOES QUIETLY
The Birth of 1905 Finds City
Peaceful After Attending
Lively Wake of 1904
SHATTEE KESOLUTIONS
.Many Start With Good In
tentions but Wind Up by
Breaking Them, as Usual
Same old resolution.
That he'll make a start.
Clinging to the ribbons
On the fabled water cart.
Same temptation lures him.
Resolution getting lame,
New Year's jay reformer
Says he'li take the same.
The first dawn of 1905 found San
Francisco with some traces of head
ache, but full of good resolutions. Mar
ket street looked a little ashamed of
itself. A blind man could have seen
that something had "been doing" at
the wake of the year 1904.
Resolutions! The city was packed
with them. The imbiber resolved not
to Imbibe, the knocker resolved not to
knock, the surly resolved to be pleas
ant, the spendthrift resolved to save,
and the grafter resolved to be honestâ
but that was In the morning. Alas,
many a one who turned over a new
leaf turned It twice and found the same
page before themâas usual.
The City Prison drew a plentiful
quota of drunk cases, as usual. The
knocker who laid away his hammer in
the morning got a heavier one in the
evening, as usual. The surly man's
breakfast was cold and he threw it
through the window and "cussed," as
usual. The man who was going to
start a bank account woke up with
thirty cents and squandered it with
reckless prodigality, as usual.
Of course there are excuses. One of
those who was gathered into the City
Prison for carrying a package from
1904 to 1905 had the most unique one.
"I was the good resolution kid," he
said, "but in the afternoon the whole
world got on a jag. Shook my house,
shook me, shook my resolutions, shook
everything."

LAYS HIS WHIP
ON THE TRUSTS
Thomas B. Walker, Capital-j
Ist, Exposes Dangers Found i
in Modern Combinations
UPHOLDS COMPETITION
Considers the Men Who Have
Made Fortunes and Decries
Prejudice Against Them
"The Principles and Methods of Suc
cessful Business Men" was the subject I
of an address by Thomas B. Walker
of Minneapolis, capitalist, philanthro
pist, land owner and generally success
ful business man, at the Y. M. C. A.
yesterday afternoon. The auditorium
was crowded. On the platform were j
Edward Coleman, Rolla V. Watt and
the general secretary of the Y. M. C.
A., Henry J. McCoy.
In the course of his address Mr.
Walker said:
The modern development of the combination i
methods so common among all classes, out of
which the trust has come. Is unjustifiable In
greater or lees degree. That men whose Ideas
of business integrity and fair dealing in other
respects should be so blunted as to justify
their efforts at accumulating wealth through
such methods Is on a par with the conduct of ]
labor unions. They are both founded on the
same intention of limiting competiUon and
taking advantage of the publicâthe capitalist I
supporting his efforts by means of trade
manipulations and the labor unions adding ,
direct physical force in enforcing their de
mands.
They are both unwise, unpatriotic and 1
against the best interests of the public. It j
does not follow, however, that business men
generally are in favor of trusts. A large part
of them are opposed to such measures.
I have known many who have strongly op
posed the formation of trusts, although they
could have gained largely by giving them
their approval and co-operation. As one be- [
longing to this class, I can say that I have de- |
feated several such well-planned efforts, that j
would have resulted very profitably to me I
from a money standpoint, and my approval
would have enabled the promoter to complete
the combinations.
Competition under Individualism Is the only
means of developing a higher and better civil
ization and the only source from which man
kind has been raised from the tribal state to i
the present civilization. It is the only means
by which progress will be made and the only
safe reliance for the future.
Selfish combinations constitute the great
danger to modern civilization, and especially
to free government. And every one who lends
a helping hand to encourage or advance and
enlarge this modern mania is adding his mite j
toward the final demoralization of free govern- :
ment and best interests of mankind.
Any one familiar with the modern business
world, whether "frenzied finance" or more I
sober and moderate ways and principles of j
doing business, will admit that many men I
handling large financial and industrial inter- j
ests are found pracitclng business methodsl ;
that are not of the nature of the golden rule j
ways.
But when we come to analyze and follow, !
step by step, the men who have accomplished
the best results In industrial and commercial !
life, we find that, as a general proposition,
the methods and principles followed have been j
more trustworthy, reliable, honorable and fair j
than those customarily practiced by the gener- |
ality of men.
The men who have gained Jarge fortunes are
M much entitled to the respect, confidence and
good will, and as little deserving of prejudice !
against them, as any class of men among us, :
They are in general reliable, friendly and '
helpful in charitable work and public spirited, j
and they generally deal with others with fair- j
ness and honesty.

Two Young Footpads Hold
Up and Plunder a School
Girl Out on Corbett Road
Two small boys, each about 11 years
of age, successfully played the role of
footpad on Saturday afternoon, their
victim being Alfrida Garlain, a school
girl living on the Corbett road. The
boys are Charles Westward, 621 Eliza
beth street, and John Fraser, 1066 Noe
street.
They met the girl on the Corbett
road shortly after 2 o'clock. She had
a dollar in her hand and when they
became aware of that fact one of them
pulle/d a toy pistol out of his pocket
and pointing it at the girl ordered her
to hand over the dollar. She refused
and the other grabbed hold of her hand
and bit her fingers till she screamed
with pain and dropped the dollar.
The youthful footpads picked up the
dollar and ran till they caught a Twen
ty-fourth street car, which they board
ed. The car was on its way to Mission
street. The robbery was reported to
the police and they discovered that the
boys had gone down town to see the
sights. The residences of their parents
were watched and about 4 o'clock yes
terday morning Westward returned
home and was promptly placed under
arrest by Policemen Bolton and Cronin.
He was booked at the City Prison for
a public institution and was later sent
to the detention home. Fraser has not
yet been arrested.

Albert GoodmarV, Does Not See Ap
proach injr Engine and Is Fatally
Injured at Sunnyslde.
Albert Goodman, a vineyardist, liv
ing at the Vineyardists' Home on Sac
ramento street, was run down by an
outbound Southern Pacific train last
night at Sunnyside crossing and fatal
ly injured. Goodman had been visit
ing friends in Sunnyside and started
for home. He evidently did not see or
hear the approaching train. Before
the engineer could bring the engine to
a stop Goodman had been struck and
hurled fifty feet to one side.
The injured man was conveyed to
the City and County Hospital by T.
Minhmer, a member of the Humane
Society, residing at 2034 O'Farrell
street. It was found that Goodman

and a laceration of the scalp, with a
possible fracture of the skull, and that
he was Internally injured. His chances
for recovery are slight.
THIEVES WORK AMONG THE
MARKET-STREET CROWDS
I One of the Victims Was Max Leh
mann. Who Reports That He Lost
Diamond Stickpin.
Thieves mixed among the crowds on
Market street Saturday night and early
yesterday morning and some people
who did not keep their valuables at
home are regretting their carelessness.
No arrests were made.
One of the victims was Max Leh
mann, a printer at 227 California
street. He reported at police head
quarters yesterday afternoon that he
was robbed of a valuable diamond
stickpin while taking in the sights on
Market street early yesterday morn
ing. He was walking along when a
man threw a handkerchief in his face,
snatched his stickpin from his scarf
and disappeared In the crowd before
Lehmann could raise an alarm. The
theft was done so quickly and so un
expectedly that Lehmann had no op
portunity of observing the thief close
ly enough to be able to give a descrip
tion.
