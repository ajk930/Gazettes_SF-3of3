BUENOS AYRES, Aug. 28.â A great
sensation has been created here owing
to the surprising by troops of the Gov
ernment of Uruguay of a Uruguayan
insurrectionary force numbering 180
men, fully armed and equipped, under
Colonel Pampillon, on a steamship on
the Uruguayan coast, but in Argentine
territory.
President Ordenez of Uruguay had
been warned that preparations were
being made for an insurrectionary ex
pedition, and dispatched two forces
with armed vessels to watch for the
expedition. At night the Government
troops attacked the insurrectionists
with a continuous and merciless fire.
Many of the latter swam ashore, but
eight, badly wounded, were captured.
The fate of the others is not known.
The insurrectionary vessel was cap
tured and with it a considerable quan
tity of telegraph apparatus.
Diplomatic relations between Argen-
tina and Uruguay have become much
strained owing to this incident.

The 'rains had -made -a thick and

wagon transportation and made the
movement of guns even more difficult.
Thqugh Â¦ the Japanese witnessed the
slow retirement of the eastern division
they made no "attempt" lo follow the
Russians, being- apparently exhausted
by the duel of August 24 and 25 and
the- desperate ahd unsuccessful all day
attack of August 26.
To-day the sound of car.nonr.ding
was heard plainly in Liaoyang. It is
more to the south than to- the south
east. The Japanese seem to be ad
vancing along the entire front nar
tlcularly moving with a large force up
the valley of the Liao River.
The explanation; Is given that the
Tenth f Corps, especially General Her
schelmann's division % cn the extreme
left, was confronted b'y a greatly su
perior force of Japanese. Though the
Russians fought bravely and held all
their positions, they had lost an im
mense number of officers. â¢ Probably
the retirement from : the Anshanshan
position arose from the same reason.
The whole mountain division, as well
as the eastern troops, retired apparent
ly not because of the pressure of. the
Japanese, but for strategic reasons. *
LIAOYANG, Aug. .28.â The Russian
forces have been disappointed by
anothe^ unexpected withdrawal." The
whole eastern division and the troops
on the Anshanshan position have , been
ordered to fall back to- positions nearer
Liaoyang, juat as the soldiers were ex
pecting another advance. The Japan
ese are not following the Russians.

Russians would, heavily

It was in response to a dare that Miss
Pulsipper decided to hold up the stage.
She dressed herself in men's clothing,
with boots, sombrero and leather leg
gings. Mounting a horse and adding
two big revolvers to her equipment, she
stationed herself at a turn of the road,
where she was concealed by timbsr and
thick undergrowth.
Just before dusk the stage, filled with
Eastern tourists, came along. Miss Pul
sipper rode her horse into, the middle
of the road and pointing both pistol3
at the driver commanded him to halt.
Bill Ripley, the driver, is a grizzly old
frontiersman, famous as an Indian
fighter in early days. Without a word
he drew his own revolver, leveled it at
the figure in front of him and was in
the act of tiring when Miss Pulsipper,
with a wild shriek, dropped both weap
ons and begged him not to fire. Ripley
lowered his gun Just in time to prevent
the bullet piercing the woman's body.
As Miss Pulsipper tearfully explained
it was only meant as a joke, the pas
sengers, badly frightened only a mo
ment before, laughed long and loud.
Ripley did not take a humorous view
of It, but in solemn tones warned the
young woman of the danger she ran by
playing jokes with guns in the Western
mountains. After delivering his lecture
he permitted her to return In confusion
to the 1 cottage at Graylings.

The accident occurred after' a false
start. .The flagman vainly attempted
to signal Oldfleld and Webb, who were
loading, that the start was not allow
ed, but they did not see hi3 flag and
continued around the course at a high
rato of speed.
Shortly after passing the first turn
of the mile rrack, Webb secured the
lead by a narrow margin and the men
were in relatively the same position
when passing the three-quarters pole.
In making the turn Webb's machine
skidded and raised a blinding cloud of
dust that completely blinded Oldfield
ond half smothered him.
Not being able to see that he had
completed the turn, Oldfield continued
his course and crashed through the
fence. When Oldfield failed to appear
after Webb had emerged from the
du.st cloud there was considerable ex
citement, but it was soon announced
that he was not seriously injured.
The race was run later and won by
Webb by a large margin. It was the
most important event of the day. the
prize being the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition trophy, valued at $500.
In a three-mile exhibition Oldfield
made the distance in 3:15 2-3.

eastern fronts. General Kuropatkin is withdrawing his forces to the inner line of his defenses, and the Japanese are closely pressing the
pursuit. All of the Russian advanced positions have been abandoned. General Kuropatkin's concentration of his forces by lessening the
extent of his front means that he has elected to have the decisive battle occur here and at once. The Russian position is strongly intrenched.

LIAOTANG, Thursday, Aug. 25.âNu
merous reliable reports which have
reached here through a dispatch carrier
and other persons are to the effect that
the Port Arthur fortress Is likely to
hold out for two months, and possibly
until January, even under such a
strength of assault as the Japanese are
using.
Contrary to the belief here that the
Japanese had taken the outer forts at
Port Arthur, it is now understood that
the Russians up to August 15 were suc
cessfully defending a five-mile circum
ference, and that although the old town
'was receiving an average of twenty
five Japanese shells daily the restau
rants and clubs, properly safeguarded,
continued opening, and there was order
throughout the town.
The Japanese occasionally shell the
new town and often attempt to rush the
outer trenches, sometimes arriving to
within 100 yards of them, when they
are unable to hold their own owing to
the mortality in their ranks.
SIAY HOLD OUT FOR MONTHS.
"Yesterday evening there was a
vigorous engagement on the east front,
the Japanese advancing-' on Anplnpr.
They were repulsed, however, though
the Russians had no artillery, the bat
tle being carried on at the point of the
bayonet.
"The Russians finally retreated on
their principal positions, supported by
artillery. ' [ ,
"The Tamboff regiment defended one
position from 1 o'clock in the morning
until 4 o'clock In the afternoon, when
Its colonel was wounded. The regiment
was then driven out of its position by
the fire of Japanese guns from the
heights.
"Six guns were abandoned. Our losses
amounted to 1500. â¢
"On August 27 the Japanese did not
take the offensive to any great extent.
The Russians retired on their new po
sitions, whi'e the Japanese advanced to
Taempin by way of Yudiuku."
"In the southeast the Russians re
pulsed all the Japanese attacks, while
our troops on the right flank assumed
the offensive and drove the Japanese
toward Tousinanu and Tasemtupa. Our
losses amounted to 400.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 2S. â The

"On August 4 our artillery opened fire
for the purpose of developing the
strength of the enemy. Numerous
skirmishes followed.
"On August 6 the Russians mounted
heavy guns in the neighborhood of
Yutashan and shelled us. Our artillery
assembled at Chukaitung-jj&nd re-.

August S. After a hot fight we cap
tured and occupied Takushan and
Siaokushan.
"On August 9 the Russians en
deavored to retake these positions.
They made a desperate night assault,
but were repulsed. The Russian artil
lery mistook the retreaters for Japan
ese and fired upon them. Our reserves
arrived on the 10th, greatly strength
ening our position.
"On the night of August 13 our right
wing made an attack in the direction
of Yutashan. It reached Koklatung 1
undiscovered and a desperate fight fol

the bayonet in a midnight fight. The
battle continued for some days and
the Japanese finally succeeded In occu

TOKIO, Aug. 28, noon.â A wounded
Japanese officer who has returned here
gives interesting details regarding the
earlier operations against Port Arthur.
He says:
"Our forces, after a hot fight, occu
pied Antzulian . and commenced a
further advance. On July 30 our right
wing advanced on Shantaikou, our
center toward Shulshlying and Itzu
shan and the left from the direction of
Dalny. The first general attack after
this advance was directed against Ta
kushan and Siaokushan. The right
wing then advanced to Chlaoklawelzu
and sent outposts to a pine forest near
Kokaitung.
"We dug trenches for our outposts,
each a meter square deep, which per
mitted two men to stand in each.
Twenty-five meters separated each
trench. These trenches proved some

meeting to-night to discuss the pres
ent condition of the stockyards strike.
After the adjournment of the meeting
those present would not divulge what
they had done, but made the an
nouncement that nothing definite had
been settled and that another meeting
would be held in the mornine.
By some members of the executive

that the proposition should be made
to the packers to call off the strike
if the packers will make Individual
agreements with the men.
Cornelius Shea, head of the na
tional organization of teamsters, ar
rived in Chicago to-night. He de
clared that he had come to confer

SOLAXO DEMOCRATS MEET.
The- advance began at 10 o'clock on
the night of August 2D, the Japanese
following their usual custom of trying
to force under darkness a position
which had been proved impregnable
during. the day. The rifle fire gradual
ly increased until midnight, when the
principal attack was made on our left.
The Japanese came up in solid masses,
throwing themselves against the Rus
sian position with wild shouts of "ban
zai"! Every attack was beaten back
with tremendous loss.
At one place the Japanese broke Irne
and fled, leaving the dead in heaps.
The Russians followed with the bay
onet up to the next line of' trenches,
but there was a lulljuntll 4 o'clock In
the morning, when reinforcements
joined the attackers.
The Japanese again advanced, slow
ly and stubbornly, covered by a hail of
artillery. The Russians remained in
their positions until 1 o'clock and then
retired, without even bringing up the
reserves. Their losses were about 1500.
The Japanese losses are not known,
but they were heavy. The Russians
were unable to remove, six guns from
their high positions owing to the condi
tion of the roads, but before the guns
were left behind they were disabled.
The Tamboff, Orloff and Briansk reg
iments distinguished themselves at
bayonet work. Colonel Larapoff with
several companies of cavalry led a wild
saber charge, before which the" Japa
nese broke in confusion, but the Cos
sacks ventured too. far in pursuit and
came under a terrific artillery fire, with
the result that they suffered heavily
in men and horses.
This evening the sound of guns,
which had been heard all day long. Is
slackening. All the forces of the Red
Cross are mobilizing in the expectation
of heavy work. .
The Russian list of losses Is not yet
complete, but It Is not believed it will
be heavy except on the eastern front.
So far throughout the fighting their
guns have been exceptionally well
placed and masked. During the fight-
Ing of August 25 the artillery inflicted
tremendous losses on the Japanese,
who, on the other hand, fired wildly.
LIAOYANG. Aug. 28.â The fight of
August 25 and 26 developed not only
the immense strength of the Japanese
artillery, but Involved several hand-to
hand fights and bayonet charges.
The first movement was made by
General Nodzu, from Erdah, on the
morning of August 25, with about a
division and a half. The Japanese con
centrated the fire of nearly sixty guns
on the Llandlanslan position. Among
these guns were mountain batteries
and heavier cannon, the latter includ
ing four howitzers.
The Cossacks checked the first at
tempt of the Japanese infantry to ad
vance In the direction of Tounsinpu.
General Kuroki then joined in the at
tack and led a general assault, press
ing heavily on the center of the left
Hank, while at the same time attempt
ing to turn the extreme left.

Rev. Mr. Leland, who Is pastor of the

since maintained it day and night. To
night he went to Leland's home with
deputies to change the guard, accord

found the house in darkness, but could
distinguish Parker and Jenks standing
in the doorway. He explained his mis

The Tientsin correspondent of the
Standard, discussing the distance the
Japanese are now from Port Arthur,
declares that they are unable to ap
proach nearer the new town, owing
to the fire from the Russian ships. The
Japanese commander, the correspond
ent says, has ordered that no shells
be thrown into the town, for the sake
of the non-combatants.
LONDON, Aug. .29.â The London pa
pers this morning have numerous spe
cial dispatches from the Far East, most
of them dealing with the situation at
Port Arthur. It Is pointed out that the
Japanese tactics are very similar to
those adopted by General Oyama in
1894, but that, granting that the Jap
anese have penetrated as far as repre
sented, which is considered doubtful,
there are still formidable forts to be
silenced before a general assault is
possible.
Equal interest is displayed here In
what is regarded at the precarious po
sition of General Kuropatkln'a forces.
According to a dispatch to the Dally
Mail from Koupangtze, dated August
27, Russian staff officers confessed
themselves completely In the dark as
to the meaning of the Japanese move
ments and that consequently they had
no definite plan. Ten days ago, feeling
that Liaoyang would be surrounded,
General Kuropatkin began to draw his
troops northward. Then, on the Jap
anese retiring, he brought them back
again, but continued his preparations
for effecting a retreat. There is no
doubt, says the correspondent, that the
Russian army is now completely at the
mercy of the Japanese whenever they,
choose to attack.
The Liaoyang correspondent of the
Dally Telegraph, in a dispatch dated
August 28, says that the Japanese are
pushing in against three sides of the
city, near which there is continuous
fighting. A great quantity of trans
portation has been sent north, leav
ing Liaoyang ready for all eventual
ities.
The rumor that the Japanese lost
guns at Siaullns, the correspondent
says, turns out to have been incorrect.
The correspondent continues:
"The Japanese are reported to be
adopting a new method of night at
tack. They concentrate searchlights on
the point attacked, thus preventing the
garrison from seeing anything."
Describing recent fighting, the cor
respondent says:
"The shooting on both sides was
splendid, the Russians contesting every
Inch of the ground with all their char
acteristic stubbornness. The Japanese
attack from the direction of the Llao
River has not yet developed."
Special dispatches from Shanghai re
port that there is a hitch regarding the
cruiser Askold and the destroyer
Grozovoi. The Japanese Government
having discovered, the dispatch says,
that the paroled crews of the Variag
and Korletz have been drafted into the.
Baltic fleets, now insists that China
shall retain the crews of the cruiser
and the destroyer until the end of the
war.

General Kuropatkin seems to be
well satisfied with the situation. One
describes him as being in high spirits
and laughing and joking at a meeting
of the St. George's Society at Liaoyang.
The Russian losses to date are stated
to be about 1500. The Russian batteries
inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese.
Several batteries which were quickly
collected by Grand Duke Serge
Michaelovitch were dispatched to the
Far East to-day.
After three days of heavy fighting,
the latter part of which was impeded
by rain, the Russians were compelled
to disable six guns which it was im
possible to take from the high po
sitions over the muddy, roads, but dur
ing the fighting oh the southern front
they captured some Japanese guns.
It is reported also that they destroyed
some Japanese mountain batteries.
ST. PETERSBURG, Aug. 29.â All the
news of Liaoyang, official or otherwise,
shows that General Kuropatkin is
gradually drawing in his advanced po
sitions to the Inner ring of his de
fenses.
These Chinese say that twenty trans
ports, bearing 22<00G. troops to rein
force the besiegers of Port Arthur,
have arrived at Port Dalny during the
past fortnight. - â¢
During the night of August 22 a
heroic band of. 500 Japanese at
tempted to captur^ Fort No. 5 in the
midst of a storm. Almost the entire
detachment was killed. The Chinese
declare, however, that the . Russians
have evacuated Fort No. 5, but
whether by reason of this assault or
the Japanese artillery fire cannot be
learned. The Japanese are unable to
-occupy No. 5.
The fighting from August 17 to Au
gust 22 was severe, but since the lat
ter date it has been comparatively
light.
On August 26 the fort on Liaoti
Mountain was fired upon from six
Japanese torpedo-boats, but the result
of this action is not known.
The Russian marines have left the
ships in the harbor and are working
at the land batteries. Shells from the
Japanese' fire continue to fall in Port
Arthur and the dockyards and the
warships have scattered about the
harbor in attempts to protect them
selves from the enemy's projectiles.
A Chinese who was employed on
the docks at Port Arthur says that the
battleships Retvizan, Poltava and
Sevastopol are badly damaged. The
first mentioned ship rests low In the
water at the stern. The battleship
Pobleda is in fighting condition. There
are also - four gunboats and several
torpedo-boat destroyers in the harbor.
The recent report that eight destroyers
escaped from Port Arthur cannot be
confirmed.
The Japanese are constructing forts
at Louisa Bay, northwest of Port
Arthur.
Seven hundred Chinese who went to
Port Dalny in the hope of sharing

boom there returned to Chefu to-day
and report that the Japanese are

CHEFU, Aug. 28. â Information
which to a very great extent confirms
previous reports of the conditions at
Port Arthur was received here to-day
by junks, which left there on August
24 and 26.
The most important statement
agreed to by passengers on these junks
confirms the report that the Kussians
have been driven from the fort im
mediately east of the railroad. This
fort is named Rihlungshan and is lo
cated on the tall of the Dragon Hills,
along the summits of which the east
ern defenses of Port Arthur are built.
When the Russian forces retired
from Fort Etzshan they entered fort
No. 15, to the north of Chaochanko.
During the nights of August 18 and
19, while It was raining, the Japanese
attempted to storm' Fort Antszshan,
which is a strong position adjoining
E^tzshan, toward the city, but they
were repulsed with heavy losses.
NEW YORK, Aug. 28.â Fifteen hun
dred members of the Brotherhood of
Locomotive Engineers, representing lo

at a meeting here to-day unanimously
voted to support the contention of the
motor engineers employed on the ele
vated road, that the men employed in
the subway shall be paid the union
wage of $3 50 for a nine-hour day, in
stead of for a ten-hour day, the rate
which General Manager Bryan of the

poses.

ordered on the elevated in case Bryan
refuse to. grant the demands of the
brotherhood.
It is estimated that the balloon was

from the World's Fair grounds yester

In partial explanation, he said that
he had intended to take such action

General, Governor for 6even years and
United States Senator for six years, he
Cecls that he has been sufficiently hon

dered political service during a period
of years sufficient to entitle him to be
relieved of further active political ef
fort. He desires to devote more time to
his personal affairs and professional
duties. Mr. Hill continues his work in
the present campaign and to his friends
said that he would always maintain
his interest in Democratic success, but

it Oakla^l, San Jose, Sacramento. Eureka and San Dicjfo. <nHEALDSBURG. Aug. 28. â A great
deal of interest was aroused through
out this county two weeks ago by the
discovery of human bones burled in the
Ransome Powell ranch. The bones
were supposed to have been those of a
white woman. The position and loca
tion of the remains suggested foul
play, .as they were found in the brush
at the side of a creek. A letter clear
ing up the mystery was to-day re
ceived from a former resident of this
city. The- writer said that when a
child he remembered having seen the
Indians bury a squaw where the bones
were found.

TACOMA, Aug. 2S.â The steamship
Victoria brings news from Nome that
Joseph Schubert, engineer of the Mat
tie mine, and three others have been
arrested for stealing $18,000 ln nuggets
and gold dust from sluice boxes two
weeks ago. The Mattie is one of the
Wild Goose Mining Company's famous
producers, being located ten miles from
Nome.
Schubert was accused of the crime
and arrested. When questioned he told
the Government officials that he had
just dumped a bucketful of gravel into
a car and was pushing It out to be
dumped into the sluice box, when he
was struck on the back of the head.
He claimed to have neither seen nor
heard any one. An hour later he was
found bound and gagged. There are
no Injuries or marks on his head,
which fact caused all concerned to
doubt his story. He is said to have
confessed the day before the Victoria
sailed, his confession, it is said, im
plicating three others; two* of whom
were arrested and jailed at Nome.

LOS ANGELES, Aug. 2S.â For the
first time since there have been two
railroads built into Los Angeles from
the East there were no overland trains
in or out of the city to-day. Traffic
or. the Southern Pacific is at a stand
still, owing to the washing out of the
track on the desert yesterday between
Beaumont and El Casco. Three miles
of track was carried out and traffic
will not be resumed before to-morrow
morning.
The effect of the water at the scene
of the cloudburst yesterday was terri
fic. Eighty-pound steel rails were
twisted and broken like wooden things
and carried considerable distance from
their original resting places. Consid
erable stock was drowned, country
bridges were carried away and roads
were washed out. The Southern Pa
cific overland trains, both east and
west bound, are tied up. The Santa Fe
has not yet brought any of the delayed
trains into this city over its regular
route, although the damage to the
track at various places in Arizona has
been temporarily repaired.
A washout at Oro Grande last night
gave that road another spell of trouble
and caused delay to trains. This has
been overcome, 'however, and It is ex
pected trains will begin to arrive over
the Santa Fe main line from the East
to-morrow without further interrup
tion.

SAN RAFAEL, Aug. 28.â Robert
Item of 706 California street, San

of the Mount Tamalpais -Scenic Rail
road to-day and instantly killed.
Item was out for a tramp with C.
Reckewell of 1309 Stockton street,
San Francisco, and Robert Heidenfeld.
The men had climbed Tamalpals and
were returning to Mill Valley. Item
became separated from his friends and
made the descent along the railroad
track. When near West Point the
gravity car, which leaves the summit
once a day, rounded a corner and be
fore Item could get to a place of
safety he was struck. Coroner Sawyer

On the return trip more bottles of
Asti wine were opened and each one
of the party was presented with a sou
venir bottle of chianti. The trip to the
city occupied a long time, owing to
the fact that the train had to go
around the tunnel cave-in to land its
passengers at Sausalito. The city was
reached by half-past nine.
Senor Rosario. Governor of Batan
and member of the Board of
Education of the Philippines, spoke in
highest terms of California and its
wonderful resources. As to the climate,
he likes that so well that he intends
to prolong hJs stay in America one
month after the departure of the rest
of the commission. The others will
leave Tuesday afternoon on the Pacific
Mail steamship Manchurii. and it is
to be 'hoped that a large crowd will
be on the pier to wish them "adios."
Among those who looked after the
welfare of the guests on the trip were:
Frank J. Symmes. A. A. Watkins, Cap
tain Charles F. Baker, U. S. A.: Judge
F. M. Angellotti. Herbert Slater of
Santa Rosa, R. E. Baer of Healdsburg
and Andrea Sbarboro. At the villa the
guests were made welcome by Mrs.
Rossi, Miss Maria "Rossi and Miss E.
Gherini.
If the remaining members of the
visiting commission of Filipinos do not
return to their homes with pleasant
memories of this country and the taste
of the Golden State's rich vintage on
their tongues it will not be through
any fault of the Italian-Swiss colony
at Astl, Sonoma County, Cal.
Yesterday morning, at the invitation
of the colony and escorted by prom
inent'members of the Citizens' Recep
tion Committee, twenty of the Commis
sioners left the Ferry building en route
to inspect the big winery and vineyards
situated at Astl. A special car was
provided for the party on the trip to
the vineyard and a light lunch and
native liquid refreshments were served
to the guests.
On arriving at Asti the entire party,
which was under the charge of Andrea
Sbarboro, was met by the president of
the colony, P. C. Rossi, and his charm
ing wife and daughter. A thorough in
spection of the great winery was made.
Rossi explaining the working of the
various machines. The visitors listened
attentively to his remarks and chat
tered volubly when they were trans
lated into Spanish by A. W. Fergusson.
After the inspection th? party visited
the beautiful Pompeiian villa, built by
Sbarboro as a summer home, and then
sat down to a typical Italian-Swiss
dinner in the arbors in the rear of th^
villa. During the dinner Sbarboro
made a short speech, to which Senor
Legarda replied. Then a drive through
the far-reaching vineyards finished the
stay at Asti.
He was driven to the home of Presi
dent F. B. Gault of Whitworth Col
lege, where he took dinner and re
mained until evening, when he de
livered a lecture at the First Presby
tc-rian Church to the Young Men's
Christian Association and other young
people. The address made no refer
ence to politics and was the first of its
kind to be delivered since leaving
Washington. To-night the Secretary
is the guest of Senator A. G. Foster.
To-morrow morning he will take a
cruise on Puget Sound on the Unitec
States revenue cutter Grant and will
visit Seattle and the navy yard at
Bremerton.
TACOMA, Wash., Aug. 28. â Leslie
M. Shaw, Secretary of the Treasury,
arrived in Tacoma to-day on his West
ern trip, under-"the direction of the
National Republican Committee. He
was met at the depot by a large dele
gation . of former residents ot Iowa,
most of whom were his personal
friends. lf\ the delegation were two
men who were In college at Mount
Vernon, Iowa, at the time Shaw was
a student there and who were present
when he graduated in 1877. Others
had known him intimately during the
early part of his present career.
The reception at the depot, although
undemonstrative because the day was
Sunday, was like a reunion of Iowa
people. The secretary surprised many
by remembering all his old friends
and by being able to call them by
their tirst names.
When outside the city the horse be
came frightened by an approaching
automobile ;md ran away. Later the
animal was stopped and the uncon
scious victims were brought to Stock
ton.
STOCKTON. Aug. 2S. â While on the

internally.
The interment of the body of Miss
Mobley's brother was to. have taken
place yesterday afternon at Â¦Wood
bridge Cemetery, twelve miles from
Stockton. Professor Ridenour, who is
a member of the Stockton High School

after 3 o'clock.

The American Magnesite Company
has made official statement of its plans,
H. C. Stillwell, vice president and Pa
cific Coast agent, and C. H. Spinks, su
perintendent, appearing before the
Board of Supervisors to discuss the
subject. These planrj are exactly as
have been outlined in The Ca.l, the
two officials merely giving further pub
licity in support of a petition to have
the road now building up the Aroyo
Wocho from Livermore completed as
soon as possible. â¢
The officials told the Board of Su
pervisors that if it would complete
the road to the southern county line
of Alameda County that th,e American
Magnesite Company would have the
eight miles from the county line to
their mines completed in time to have
the two sections Join. They told the
board that they expected' to have their
factories up and in 'operation in less
than six months, that their mines
would be ready to ship ore in that pe
riod, that inside of two weeks a gang
of men would be put to work opening
up the mines, surveying their section
of the road,, and by the time the county
section of the road was finished and
their factories in Oakland up they
would be ready to ship magnesite for
the supply of the world.
Acting upon these statements, the
board agreed to advertise for bids for
the completion of the road, which has
already been surveyed, and bids will
be submitted inside of three weeks.
C. H. Spinks. the superintendent of
the new mines, said to-day:
We are absolutely ready to go ahead with
tne development of the largest magnesite
property in the United States and the largest

that these institutions flourish.
"Many believe that it would not be
comfortable for foreigners in Chili if
the protection of Viceroy Kai was
withdrawn. On several occasions he
has proved the friend of the English
and Americans. During the Boxer
troubles he saved the lives of many
foreigners.
"The viceroy's son is a man of 28
years. He is progressive and. -has a
good grasp of- English."
After tutoring the viceroy's son for
a year. Peck joined the faculty of one
of the colleges of the province as an
instructor in English. He was engaged
in this work up to the time of his re
turn to America. The progressive edu
cational system ncr\r being developed
in Chili Is due largely to the reform
movement in China. Viceroy Yuan
Shih Kai is co-operating with the for
eigners in the establishment of schools.
He was also the friend of the whites
during the Boxer trouble.
In speaking of his observations dur
ing his two years' residence in China,
Peck says:
He was tutor for a year to the son of
Yuan Shih Kai, the viceroy of the
province of Chili. This district is
known as the "metropolitan province,"
and it is. here that, the greatest edu
cational advance is being made. The
province comprises the cities of Peking
and Tientsin. â¢Â¦Â¦Â¦ ....

Peck, who has been engaged in educa

years, has returned to resume his

Peck has been connected with the edu
cational movement in Northern China
and speaks with enthusiasm at the pro
gress that is being made under the,di
rection of the English and American
tutors.

The sugar trade declined from $2.
479,011 to $l,S27.074, the entire output
being sent to Japan, Hongkong and
China, no portion being exported to
the United States. Americans made up
more than one-half the total arrivals,
the greater portion being classed as
professional men. -â
WASHINGTON, Aug. 28.â According
to a statement given out to-day at
the Bureau of Insular Affairs, the Phil
ippine Import trade advanced nearly
J2.0OO.000 in value during the nln^
months ended March last, and a slight
falling off is shown in the exports as
a result of decreased shipments in
copra and sugar, although hemp ani
tobacco are exported in larger amounts
than for the corresponding: thre a 
fourths of the previous year.
Excluding gold and silver and United
States Government purchases, the cus
tom house returns give the total vain*
of merchandise imported for the nin<*
months ended March, 1904. at $25,9:':.
024 and the exports at $22,236,169. a 7
per cent increase in imports and 2 pet
cent decrease in exports. The ricÂ°
growing sections of the British ami
French East Indies have enjoyed most
of the increase in trade, the latter ter
ritory sending three-fourths of the
510,000,000 worth of rice received.
Except for those countries from
which rice is obtained the statement
says that for the first time since Amer
ican occupation the United States learls
in the amount of merchandise sent to
the islands and that the outgoing trad.'
with the principal countries shows a
decline in the value of shipments to
the United States, more than $700,000
of the loss being credited to sugar ex
ports and $600,000 to hemp.
More than one-half of the Imports
consisted of food and animals, whiK
the exports were chiefly agricultural
products, hemp exports amounting to
$16,000,000 in round numbers. The fig
ures on the carrying trade show an
increase in volume of business done un
der the American flag, the amount car
ried to the islands being $1,533,027, while
$2,237,805 of the exports left the islands
under the American flag. British ves
sels took $1S.172.819.
Two of the former volunteer flre companies
are at present on a call-pay plan, and Chief
K. K. Krauth asserts that these are the only
companies he can properly direct and depend
vip- n at a fire. There are three volunteer hose
companies : but. according tr> Chief Krauth. th<Â»
members of thes^ organizations and their labor
fit firra is unreliable. \\> will probably take
up for discussion at our next meeting; the re
organization of the flre dfrartmpnt, and if we
can sec our way financially we trill very likely
j.Tovide for raid firemen.
I believe it would be best to reorganize the
fire <JejÂ«.rtment and do away with the volunteer
-â¢â¢ompanies, but just how soon we can do this
It is difficult to say. \Ve will soon meet to
Cx. the r.'xt tax levy, but ro exorbitant are
Rorrie cf the demands that have b*en made on
UM Ci:y Trustee* for increases in salaries by
tbe members of several of the municipal de
partments tJiat we may have to allow the fire
dfpa'iincnt to run alons as It is for another
y;*r.
ALAMEDA, Aug. 28. â As soon as
the finances of the city will permit the
volunteer fire companies that have
served the municipality for thirty
years will be disbanded and the de
partment reorganized on a paid basis.
This plan is recommended by City
Trustee Dr. H. M. Pond in a report
cf the investigation of the recent
Sherman-street fire that has been filed
â¢with the City Clerk and which reads
as follows:
At a result of the lnvrstlsation made by
tfco Board cf City TruÂ«t<"*s regarding the cir
cumetances connected vith the flre on Sherman
street, It Mcmi ehown : That there was an
*rror coirmltted in that the engine was not
present Â«it the fire; that there was evidence
Kiven during the fire that the day for the
volunteer flre department Is passed; that the
Â¦whole dej*rtrnent thould be put on a paid
!Â¦-â¢â¢â¢. probably en the pay-call plan. That.
Â¦;..-. : r Into ooncideratlon the Intensity anJ
rapidity of the fire In the stable. It Â«as im
possible for any department to have saved
th- horses and vehicles contained therein, and
the prevention of widespread conflagration re
flect* credit on the department, hampered as
it was by lack of wat*r and pressure, and ex
perience in efficient concentrated action.
For the better effectiveness of the service,
it Feems advisable to Institute regular drill
tartlcs. so That each man may know hlÂ« exact
Â»-pher#> cf action, and for the betterment of
the discipline it Efems advisable to put the
entire department on some paid plÂ»n.
Speaking with reference to the re
port. Dr. Pond said:
i The approaching conclave of the
Knights Templar, which will bring
thousands of visitors to California, has
j induced several of the improvement
organizations and real estate dealers of
Oakland. Berkeley and Alameda to is
sue some choice literature descriptive
of the advantages, climatic and other
wise, of the cities on the eastern shore
of the bay.
These publications are in most cases
illustrated with handsome photo-en
gravings, which tell better than any de
scriptive writing could do the natural
advantages and points of interest in
Alameda County. Several indexed
maps have been issued, which are ex
cellent street guides and show the lo
cations of public buildings and schools
,in the different cities.
In addition to these purely local pub
lications there is the official pamphlet
of the Alameda County commissioners
to the St. Louis Fair, many copies of
which will be distributed among the
visiting Knights Templar. The title of
this book, which is published in maga
zine form, is, "Alameda County, Cali
fornia," and it is profusely illustrated
with photographic views of many parts
of Alameda County.
The pamphlet issued by the E. P.
Vandercook Company contains much
valuable data concerning the railways
and street car lines which run into the
city, and also has much information
relative to the prices of real estate in
different parts of the city. It is illus
trated with a splendid panoramic view
of Oakland's water front and several
photographs of factories and private
dwellings.
The map of Alameda, which is pub
lished by the Advancement Association
of that city, shows the location of the
public buildings, schools and churches
of the city, and is also a street guide.
It is illustrated on the reverse side with
several photographic views of the
Island City, and on the margins is
printed a brief description of Alameda,
with information as to ferry service,
street railways and climatic conditions.
"Beautiful Berkeley" is the title of
the booklet issued by Youngs & Barry,
a well-known real estate firm of the
college city, and it is in every respect
a work of art. The cover design Is ex
ecuted in blue and gold, the colors of
the University of California, and is or
namented with the golden poppy, the
emblematic flower of the State of Cali
fornia. It -contains an excellent map
and street guide of Berkeley and also a
miniature map of the bay of San Fran-
Cisco and the surrounding counties. The
booklet is illustrated with a panoramic
view of the city of Berkeley taken from
the hills at the back of the town, and
many excellent photographs of pointh
of interest in the university grounds
public buildings and dwellings iu
Berkeley.
The pamphlet issued by the UniveÂ«
sity of California contains a series ot
excellent photo-engravings of the col
lege buildings and grounds, with ex
planatory marginal notes.
The Fruitvale Board of Trade will la
sue a map that is an excellent street
guide of that section.
The official booklet issued by the Ala
meda County commissioners to the
World's Fair is a complete resume of
the climatic conditions, natural advan
tages and industries of Alameda Coun
ty. It is profusely illustrated with pho
tographs taken in all parts of the coun
ty, and contains more reliable informa
tion as to the natural resources of this
part of California than any publication
of the kind ever before issued.

Ground has been broken for the
grading and macadamizing of Seven
teenth avenue, from East Twelfth to
East Sixteenth street. The work of
improving Hopkins street, from Four
teenth avenue to the city limits, will
soon be commenced.
One of the much' needed improve
ments, which has just been completed,
outside the city, is the placing of elec
tric lights on Orchard avenue, in Elm
hurst. Three lamps have been install
ed, one at the corner of Orchard and
Sunnyside avenues, another at Orchard
avenue and Orange street, and the
third on Orchard avenue, between Sec
ond and Third ' streets. This distribu
tion of the lights illuminates the ave
nue for a distance of ten blocks.'
The filling in of Commerce street,
from Twelfth to Twenty-first street,
has been completed, and the work of
macadamizing will be commenced im
mediately. The E. B. & A. L. Stone
Company, which has the contract for
the work, has a large force of men em
ployed and will rush the work as fast
a3 possible.-
Work of improving and repairing the
streets of this city is being pressed and
there is now in progress street w'ork
that will aggregate more than a mil
lion of dollars. Among the most im
portant of these improvements are the
repaying of Telegraph avenue, the con
struction of a wide boulevard, a mile
in length, across the Adams Tract; the
repaying of Twenty-third avenue, from
Railroad avenue to Twenty-second
street, and the filling in of Commerce
street, from Twelfth to Twenty-first
street.
The work on Telegraph avenue is
rapidly nearing completion, and it is
expected that it will be finished by th-j
last of September. The Telegraph ave
nue extension of the Thirty-sixth street
storm sewer is practically completed
and only three blocks of the work on
Thirty-sixth street remains to be-fin
ished. The entire sewer will be fin
ished before winter. â¢
Edson F. and John C. Adams and
Mrs. Julia Prather, the owners of the
Adams Tract, have dedicated a strip
of land, 110 feet wide and nearly a
mile in length, for the construction of
a boulevard, extending from the end
of Boulevard Terrace, across Adams
Point, to the head of the northeast arm
of Lake Merritt. An agreement was
entered into with the Webster Street
and Park Railroad Company, the terms
of which provide that the company
shall construct its terminus at the up
per end of the boulevard.
The property owners along Twenty
third avenue have decided to repave
that thoroughfare with bitumen, from
Railroad avenue to Twenty-second
street, and the Oakland Transit Com
pany has been requested to remove one
of the tracks on the street, making the
Twenty-third avenue line a single
track system. This will allow consid
erably more room for teams.

The ceremonies were simple, but im
pressive. Fifty of the Filipinos of the
crew of the cable ship were massed
on the rigging of the big vessel, which
was decorated with streamers for the
occasion. Three hundred yards away
floated the steamship Queen, crowded
with prominent army and navy peo
ple and officials of this and other
Washington cities. The rigging of the
Queen was also brilllcnt with flags.
About a mile away was the United
States monitor Wyoming.
As the splice was made In the cable
the officers of the Burnside set up a
cheer that, re-echoed by everybody on
the ship and the Queen, could be heard
for miles. But two ropes now held the
cable above water. With one stroke the
Seattle men severed these and the big
wires sunk from sight. Later, as the
vessel was steering Â£or this port the
various officials of the city of Seattle
and the officers of the Burnside made
brief addresses.
SEATTLE. Aug. 28.â Amid the cheer-
Ing of 300 men and worr â¢>. the shriek
ing of steam whistles .and the play-
Ing of the national anthem, the final
splicing, of the Seattle-Sitka Govern
ment cable was made at 3:30 this after
noon, ten miles out of this city.' Ten
minutes later Mayor B-llinger of Se
attle and J. F. Flynn, chairman of the
special Seattle Chamber of Commerce
committee, cut the ropes holding the
joined ends of the wires aboard the
United StateÂ« cable ship Burnside and
with a splash the completed v/lre con
necting the United States and Alaska
fell to the bottom of Puget Sound and
the work of months on the part of the
Signal Corps of the United States army
v.as completed.
Among the prominent passengers

that the experience, coming as it did

Women shrieked and fainted, children

The passengers report that the water

WEDDINGS.
Miles Baird, who gained much un
pleasant notoriety through his dis
graceful drunken escapades about the
city during the past year, was again
on a debauch early yesterday morning
and attempted to kill his wife.
About 1 o'clock yesterday morning
the guests of the Empire, a fashion-,
able hostelry on the southeast corner
of Bush and Leavenworth streets.
Avere aroused by a woman's screams.
Night Manager Signor responded and
found Baird with a dirk and a loaded
revolver running amuck in his apart
ments. His wife was crouched with
fear In one corner of the room giving
vent to a succession of unearthly yells.
Signor attempted to quiet Baird and
finding his efforts unsuccessful ran in
search of a policeman. He met Po
lice Commissioner Howell. who lives
at the Empire, coming in the front
entrance and was advised to phone
for the police.
The Central Station was communi
cated with and Officer Hogan of the
North End Station was sent to the
scene. After an hour's pacification
Baird concluded not to be a bad man
any longer and laid. away his wea
pons. Although he had exhibited a
deadly weapon and made an attempt,
according to Singnor, on the life of
his wife, he was not arrested.
Baird assumed an indignant air at
the sight of the police invasion of
his rooms and told Hogan that any
trouble that he had with his wife was
nobody's business but his own. The
manager of the Empire Is Incensed at
the disturbance caused by Baird and
has asked him to find other quarters.
Baird shot up $100 worth of fur
niture in the Russ House bar a few
months ago. At that time he was
arrested, but succeeded in getting out
of his trouble. Baird also created a
"rough house" in the tenderloin about
a year ago by getting into a fight with
his brother over a woman known
about the city as "Dody Valencia."
Baird is regarded as overbearing
and irresponsible when drinking. He
has a homicidal mania and efforts will
be made to restrain him.
Albert Murphy and Charles Wein
traut. deputy poundkeepers, were taken
before District Attorney Byington and
Captain Martin yesterday and each
made a long statement telling what
happened when Gus Scherf, driver of
â¢ the pound wagon, fhot and killed Ru
dolph Schultze last Wednesday after
. noon.
Murphy admitted that the 38-caliber
Â« revolver was bought by him last
Tuesday. Shortly before the shooting
he and Schcrf and Wointraut were in
Gobel's saloon on Ninth avenue, be
. tween F and G streets. The cartridges
Â¦were put in the revolver at that time
and It was p]ao?d in the wagon b<*-
Fide the 4 4-cullber revolver. Scherf
knew that it was th?re. Scherf did
rot see :t loaded, as h<* had gone to
the rear, but he knew that it was to
be loaded.
When they had driven for some dis
.tance after the shooting the wagon
was stopped and they discussed what
to do with Murphy's revolver. Murphy
thoug-ht the best thine was to throw
= 1t Into the bay and Sohorf suggested
â¢" they should ."plant" it. Finally Murphy
. decided to keep it and he threw it into
the Esck containing dogs' meat. Then
â¢they- met Ford, whereupon Scherf
tirrncd over the reins to Ford and dis
appeared.
Later Murphy went to the pound and
took, the revolver from the sack. He
cleaned it and carried it home, where
he hid it. The weapon was found by
the police late Saturday night and is
now held as evidence. The statements
Â¦were taken down by Stenographer
Boyle. Murphy and Weintraut will b-?
detained till they give their testimony
at the preliminary examination of
Scherf In the Police Court. If they
â tell the truth then it is likely that no
further action will be taken against
* thenj.
_ Sch*-f persists f n asserting that he
knew nothing of Murphy's revolver.
He is showing the effects of the strain.
Another witness to the bad char
acter of Gustav Scherf, charged with
the murder of Rudolph Schultze, was
found Saturday night by Detective
Cody. Edward Ettes of Twenty-ninth
and Mission streets called at the police
station and said that Scherf had once
drawn a gun on him and threatened
to fljoot him.
Ettes attempted to protect a dog
which Scherf was trying to catch
about, a week before the murder.
Scherf drew his revolver, and, point
ing it at Ettes. told him to "Get out"
or he would fill him full of holt-s. The
â¢ jclire have several witnesses who will
? testify that Scherf always carried a
c revolver and often displayed it in a
threatening manner.
Mr. and Mrs. Adolph Cohn, who have
just announced the engagement "of their
daughter Gertrude M. to Harry S. Gold
berg of Los Angeles, will be at home

There will be no foregathering of the
California Club women nor of the Fo
rum Club during the first week of Sep
tember â as has been the order of pro
cedure in former years. And the rea
son is that most of the members will be
busy that week sustaining the reputa
tion of San Franciscans for hospitality.
Such distinguished visitors as the Sir
Knights come to us but seldomâthere
fore it is but fit that the women of our
city give to the visitors their full ener
giesâthe clubs can open ' the second
Tuesday or the second Wednesday
quite as well.
Right here is a point that has appar
ently been overlooked. In one of the
clubsâ which one it doesn't matterâ the
constitution gives the board of direc
tors no power to order the postpone
ment of a regular club meeting. The
board, however, has done that very
thing. Now what the sticklers for par
liamentary law will say will be Inter
esting.
To maka a mistake Is human; to stick
to it is unpardonable. Hence, there is
no telling but the Montereyans' peti
tion may bring about a change of heart
and a change of deposit for that $1300
â now lying idle in the Examiner safe â
while the old San Antonio Mission
stands bared to the elements, roofless,
for want of funds.
In the full belief that Mr. Hearst has
been ill-advised, or not fully advised, of
the details of the matter, there is now
in circulation throughout lower Mon
terey County a petition to him setting
forth the conditions as they are. The
petitioners are full of faith in the honor
of Mr. Hearstâ that his unimpeachable
honor will promut him to keep faith
with the committee and with the peo
ple â and turn over the fund to the
league.
absolutely devoid of history; that it
holds no place in the public eye: that
it is merely a real estate "gold brick"
and something the State won't take
over as a giftâ even though the gift
slip out of the horny Hearst hand.
And that is why most of the league
members feel that they have a griev
ance. And that is why the people in
lower Monterey County feel that they,
too, have a grievance, for never had
they doubted" that upon the request for
the unused fund it would be turned
over without question for the comple
tion of this beautiful old mission of
Antonio, founded in 1771.
It will be remembered that after the
Landmarks League was fairly on its
feet and had begun its activities to
ward the safeguarding of landmarks
the Examiner entered the field with a
flourish of trumpets.
Realizing that the Influence of the
press was mighty, many members of
the league gladly accepted the help
and turned about and worked furiously
to roll up that Examiner fund, directly
contributing $1000 raised through the
league's efforts at the Chutes on May
14, 1903.
At that time the Examiner announced
daily that the moneys contributed
would be dispensed by an advisory
committee, all of whom were members
of the league. As the funds came in
th'j committee's selections of sites were
duly noted and the purchases made.
So far, so good! But now comes the
parting of the ways. The contributions
had fallpn off, then ceased â leaving
about $1300 etill in the sate. That was
a year ago last Mayâ the cash is still
in the Examiner safe.
Now, it has come to pass that In its
work of restoring Mission San Antonio
de Padua, the Landmarks League has
reached the end of its available fund,
the dollars of which have restored the
battered old walls, gathered the old
tiles and adobes from off the mission
acres, and laid the trusses for the
roof. But there operations were sus
pended as funds were low. But there
was the $1300 of the landmarks fund
in the Examiner safe. That would
carry the work on in fine fashion â cap
ital idea!
The reauest for the fund was duly
made. The members of the league
waited impatiently for the order from
New York to Mr. Robert to } Â»y over
the moneyâ the money lying ld'.e in the
Examiner safe for more than a yearâ
and of which the committee was osten
sibly to have control.
In good time, word came. But It
said: "Nay; let the Examiner go
ahead, raise more money and buy the
old theater In Monterey"â and this in
spite of the fact that the theater is
William Randolph Hearst still holds
fast ttr that $1200â the sum remaining
from the purchase of landmarks by
subscription.
Now, that's distinctly not nice of an
honorable gentleman like Mr. Hearstr
to make a promise and then forget to
keep it.

A minister or the gospel writes about
Postum: '"I was for years a sufferer
from headaches; sometimes they were
bo violent that, RToanlngr In agony, I
rrould pace the floor or garden, holding
ray throbbing head for relief.
"I tried all sorts of remedies known
to thÂ» allopathic and homeopathic
echools; sometimes I thought it was
caused bv the stomach or biliousness,
and again I would suspect it was
purely nervousness and treated myself
accordingly, but nothing ever gave me
permanent relief. Having to appear
before the public nearly every night, it
was sometimes almost impossible for
me to fulfill my en^ag-emerits. Finaily
I came to suepect that the use of tea
und coffee had something to do with
my disorder and abruptly discontinued
the use of both and took on Postum for
a trial.
"From that happy hour I commenced
to mend: gradually 1 grot better and
better, ar.d now I do not have a head-
ache u:ice In six months, and all my
other troubles are gone, too. I am now
using Pcstum exclusively and want no
better beverage.
"I know of others who have been
benefited by the use nf Postum in place
cf cotlet. A friend of mine here in Key
"West, a hardware merchant, suffered
for years with stomach and other trou-
bles while he was using coffee; finally
h* auit and began using Postum and
got well. He is devoted to Postum,
ar.J when worn and weary with busi-
r<?rs cares takes a cup of it piping hot,
and In a short time feels rested and
nourished. â¢
"Seme I know have become preju-
diced against Postum because careless
or ignorant eoolcs tried to make it as

it to boil full fifteen minutes, but when

Mrs. Clarence Mackay has a large diamond and pearl brooch, a stem and
leaf, the Joaf in three sections, says the New York Times. This brooch is set
solidly with diamonds, and in the center of one segment is a white pearl, of
another a pink one, and of the other a black pearl. She often wears this to
fasten a large bow of white tulle under hir chin.

JAPANESE WOMEN AT TENNIS.
Japanese women, for all their pretty
listlessnsss of carriage and manner,
are beginning to take an interest in
athletic sports. An American woman
tells how she played tennis in Japan
with native women.
"It is wonderful how agile they are,"
she said, "and it certainly is a most
extraordinary sight to see them playing
in the regular Japanese dress, the
pretty soft silk robe so associated with
reclining ease, and the thick soled
sandals.
"You can imagine the effect of the
sunlight on the sheen and gorgeous
hughes of the silken dress. Of course,
the serve and return of the balls sends
the gnyly costumed little ladies into
the prettiest of posturing. They look
like flowers lightly blowing about the
court.
'â¢The thick soled sandals are not hard
to run in. Indeed, I was assured they
wero most comfortable for the spoit.

DAI XT Y TABLECLOTJ IS.
Tablecloths de luxe are now favored
for set dinners. Their centers are
cemposed of lace or drawn thread.in
sertions and embroideries. This is
decorative alone, but to make it more
so a piece of gold or silver gauze is
frequently la/id on the table under the
lace insertion, through which f the
gauze gleams with dainty effect.
Silver table decorations go with the
silver gauze: gold gauze is preferable
when the flower vases are of crystal or

Two local physicians were censured by a Coroner's jury a few days
since for the grave offense of suppressing a crime that had beeen masked
under the easily worn and little respected honor of another member of the
medical profession. When a physician forgets the ethics that elevate him to
a position of the utmost confidence and trust in the community then the time
has come for immediate reform. Censure for a violation of the most sacred
obligation that may be delegated to a group of professional men is not
adequate punishment to meet the offense.
A suggestion was recently made that the local authorities convert four
blocks of Van Ness avenue into a mining dumps to remind the Knights
T^rplar and other distinguished visitors, who will be among us shortly, of
our palmy days. If the proposal was made in seriousness it is grotesque, if
it was intended as a joke :t is in bad taste. San Francisco has so far p'ro
j;resved beyond the mining age that the olden time has lost its power to at
iract even the romancer.
The revolutionists of Paraguay are doing yeoman service to prove that
the story of the general who marched his army up the hill and then marched
it down again was no joke. The malcontents arc certainly a diverting lot
true to the traditional quarrels of the South Americans and refreshingly
unconscious of their position as toy soldiers in the wars of the world. One
real battle would teach these fighting men more war than a lifetime of their
revolutions.
A United States soldier posing as a foreign nobleman succeeded a few
days since :n getting himself into a serious muddle with the peace officers
of New York and now he faces a rather gloomy future filled with prospective

the fact that the Russian system tends
to place rather old men with the colors

are spent with the colors and the con
script is then a reservist for fourteen
years. It is quite likely, therefore, that
Kuropatkin has received many reserv
ists of about CO years of age. Japan's

THE Democratic campaign in New York is open. The task was com
mitted to Senator Bailey of Texas. The Senator is privately under
stood and alleged to be the representative of the Standard Oil trust,
and bo was qualified to pour oil on the troubled waters of New York
Democratic politics. He squarely accepted protection as the proper tariff
policy of the country and discouraged any expectation that significant
reduction can be made in the rates of the Dingley tariff.
Having disposed of the economic issue of the campaign by accepting
the Republican position as .correct, he proceeded to attack the President
cs an exponent of social equality with the negro, and ran a Texas steer
gallop through the race question. In this connection, with due fervor and
opalescence of language, he announced thnt the South would not be ruled
by negroes.
If he will take his bearings he may learn that no one wants the South
to be ruled by negroes. That is not at all the question. The constitution
<ays that when the South, to avoid negro rule, suppresses the negro vote,
the negro population shall not be counted in the apportionment for members
of Congress and votes in the Electoral College. With forty members of
Congress and enough electoral votes to nearly control the Presidency,
obtained by counting the disfranchised negroes, it is not a question of
the negroes ruling the South, but of the South ruling the country by
counting her disfranchised negroes in the apportionment. Let Senator
Joseph Bailey take up that question and discuss it in his speeches in the
North and he will be listened to with lively interest.
All that President Roosevelt has ever claimed for the negro was
put in his speech at the Lincoln monument in 1903. He said: "It was
my own good fortune to serve beside colored troops at Santiago. A man
who is good enough to shed his blood Â£or his country is good enough
to be given a square deal afterward. More than that no man is entitled to,
and less than that no man shall have."
Now let Senator Bailey explain if he can that it is a square deal
to disfranchise the negro and then use him in the population apportion
ment to increase the political power of those who have disfranchised him.
Let it be understood now that no one wants to force negro rule upon
the South and that the South shall not be permitted to force its rule upon
the nation through the negro.

A MOMENT OR TWO WITH
WELL KNOWN PERSONS
TRADE was singularly dull and featureless last week all over the coun
try. From the Atlantic to the Pacific there was hardly a ripple on the
M:rfacc of the commercial pool. Even at Chicago, the center of the
uheat crop damage reports, there was nothing new of especial importance.
There was one satisfactory condition, which was the diminution of rust
,; n .mag,- reports from the Northwest. That scare has about run its course.
The injury to the wheat crop from this cause is figured at about 15 per cent,
or about 90.000.000 bushel Â«. The Manitoba crop, as already mentioned, has
also suffered, so the total crop of the United States and British possession.;
will turn out over 100,000,000 bushels short of the estimates made in mid
summer. The deficiency will affect trade in the West and Northwest more
or Ic^s and also indirectly the business of the whole country, but the loss
is not sufficient to worry oxer.
The Chicago strike is still deranging matters throughout the West, cspe
< iallv in the cattlc-ra;?ing sections, and the stockmen of the Dakotas are re
ported in desperate straits, as, failing to find the usual outlet for their cattle,
they are obliged to keep them on the ranges anfl feed them at a heavy loss.
In addition the restriction of the operations of the packers is diminishing the
active circulation of money, which impairs credits, makes collcctons plow,
cuts down the distribution of all sorts of merchandise and the railroad earn
ings, throws thousands of men out of employment, and creates i depressing
tone in almost all lines of business. This strike and the accompanying dam
*a>:e to the wheat crop have been very detrimental to Western markets.
Another feature of general trade is the large number of clearance sales
reported in retail quarters. They arc unusually numerous and are taken
to indicate a falling off in the demand for food and clothing.
The volume of business, however, as far as the bank clearances indicate, is
at the moment rather larger than at this time last year, as the clearings
show a gain over 1903 of 6.5 per cent, which is a better showing than they have
been making of late, and most of the important cities are ranged in the in
crease column. Philadelphia, representing the textile industries, and Pittsburg,
the iron and steel trade, are prominent exceptions, the former showing a loss
of 12.2 per cent and the latter one of 18.7 per cent. The gain at St. Louis is
only 9.3 per cent, which is not a good showing, considering the stimulus which
that city ought to be enjoying from the influx of money on account of the
exposition.
Conditions in the leading staples have not changed for weeks. Pro
visions are dragging all over the country. Wool is firm enough in price, but
quieter, as the high quotations lead the manufacturers to proceed with
caution. The tendency in cotton goods is now downward rather than upward,
a? the crop prospects continue brilliant. The reports from the New England
footwear factories do not indicate any pronounced activity in this branch of
trade. Similar conditions prevail in the iron and steel trade, which is quiet,
though persistent efforts are being made in Wall street to show that the
industry has touched bedrock and is again on the upward turn. Lumber is
showing rather more activity in the Northwest, but is quieter in the East,
where the general business quietude and disturbances in the building trades
are cutting down the demand for material.
There is nothing new in Wall street. There seems to be nothing in
Mplit to produce cither a bull or a bear market, hence stock valuations show
no pronounced changes. The general tone is buoyant, however, and it would
be easier to make a bull than a bear market. Both professional and public
investors are desirous of an advance, and the bankers would like to sec one,
?.s it would create an outlet for the vast sums of idle money with which they
liave been burdened for some time and which they consider a menace, as
tending to result in undue inflation if a favorable opportunity should pre
sent itself. But the market continues inert, and the strenuous efforts to ele
vate it produce little result.
The failures for the week were 285, against 142 for the corresponding
week in 1903, but they were small and generally insignificant. The railway
earning* arc showins a light gain over last year.
Conditions on the Pacific Coast remain about as before stated. Trade,
thocgh quieter (han for several years, is still good in most lines.
TRADE CONDITIONS QUIET.

The customs officers, profiting by their Â«uc
cess in finding dutiable articles on the United
States steamer Solace, are watching the naval
vessels In the harbor. Many 6hore visitors
went out to the ships and numbers of the
strangers were spotted by the crew as reve
nue men. The battleship New York has been
boarded every day by customs men In plain
clothes. The chief boatswain's mate enter
tained ono of the innocent visitors In his room
all afternoon last Saturday, but all the offi

* ORGANIZED MAY. 1900.
Before she struck the ground, how
ever, the wind shifted sufficiently to
swing the vessel away from the land
and toward the Peleus. The wind blew
strong and the Quickstep, true to her
name, made rapid time in her drift
toward the Britisher. Those aboard the
Peleus sa'.v through the darkness the
stranger to the windward coming: down
on them, and veered away chain to es
cape the impending collision. As the
Quickstep came slowly down on the
other vessel, plowing up the mud on the
bay bottom, the chain snapped and
thirty-five fathoms of it Hew down to
the anchor below. The breaking of the
cable caused the Quickstep to swerve
from her course, and she scraped
alongside of the Peleus. with no dam
age to either vessel. Another anchor
was let go, which held, and the bark
entine held to her moorings till morn
ing, when she was towed to Mission
Bay for safer keeping.
The big British ship Peleus, which
came into port Saturday after a long
Btormy voyage from Antwerp, was
perilously near disaster while lying at
anchor off Meiggs wharf early Sunday
morning.
During Saturday night the barken
tlne Quickstep, moored In the northern
part of the bay, began to drag her an
chor before the force of a strong north
west wind. She drifted toward Alca
traz Island, and though chain was paid
out she continued to drag till she al
most touched the beach.

Two relics of Nelson, stolen Decem
ber 8, 1&00, from the Painted Hall at
Greenwich Hospital, were recovered
under rather romantic circumstances in
July last. A sailor, recently arrived
from Australia, left a package at the
Customs Depot at Greenwich. After
the usual lapse of time had passed
without any claim being presented for
the property, the package was opened
by the Inspector, who found, among
other articles, a concertina. A close
scrutiny of the latter revealed a slight
scratch near one of the screws, which
suggested the conclusion to the in
spector that a screwdriver had been
used and had slirped. The concertina
was then opened and inside of it were
found Nelson's gold watch and gold
hilt of a rword, the articles stolen more
than three years ago. The Scotland
Yard force are now workinpr up the
case. The sailor, named William Mc-
Carthy, alias Carter, has been arrested
and charged with the theft. He claims
to have left England in 1S99 for Aus
tralia and remaining there until his
recent return, but the police have
worked up his record and find it bad.
The property thus stransely recovered
was valued at ejvor 510,000.
The military rank is lower than that
of any staff corps in the navy, as it
carries fewe^r captains and command
ers ihan the corps of chaplains, pro
fessors of mathematics and naval con
structors. Thus the chaplain corps,
numbering twenty-three, has four cap
tains and seven commanders; of the
twelve professors of mathematics
three have the rank of captain and
5t.ar that of commander. The naval
ronstructors' corps of twenty-three
has five captains and five command
ers, while the civil engineers' corps,
numbering twenty-eight, has only
two captains and two command
ers. Other discriminations are made
against civil engineers, such as with
holding commutation for quarters,
which is allowed all other officers as
signed to duty at naval stations. The
services and responsibilities of an as
sistant naval constructor just out of
the Xaval Academy are less than those
of the assistant civil engineer, whose
education has not been paid for out
of the national treasury, yet the assist
ant naval constructor receives $2000
salary and the assistant civil engineer
only $1500.
Paul Morton is the thirty-fifth Secre
tary of the Navy since 179S, when that
department v.as organized. Only one
naval officer has occupied that office,
namely Captain Lewis Warrinpton, who
was appointed at interim February 15,
JS44.upon the death of Secretary Gilmer,
and served until March 14, 1844. All the
other secretaries have, with two excep
tions, been lawyers, more or less prom
inent in politics. A. E. Borie was a
business man, but held the office only
a little over three months â March 9,
1869, to June 26, 1869 â when he resigned,
and was succeeded by George M. Robe
son. It has been claimed for W. C.
Whitney that he has been the only
business man who ever wrs appointed
Secretary of the Navy, but while It
13 true that he conducted affairs of the
navy on business principles, It is also
well known that he was a lawyer by
profession and also a prominent poli
tician. The new Secretary is the second
man who has not been a lawyer nor ac
tive in politics, and he Is likely, with
the assistance of Assistant Secretary C.
H. Darling, to institute eome much
needed reforms In the contract system
and general accounts of the Navy De
partment.
RECOVERY OF RELICS.
There are still five vacancies in the
number of assistant civil engineers al
lowed for the navy, as none of the
candidates for appointment passed the
rtouisite examination. The small pay
is not an inducement for persons of
ability to enter the service. Beginning
with 51500 a year, this salary is in
creased to 5 18 00 after five years' ser
vice, and when promoted to the civil
engineer grade to $2400 and at flve
year intervals increased until it
reaches the limit of 53500.
SERIOUS HANDICAP.
On the other hand six vessels having
failed to develop the required horse
power or speed were assessed about
5100,000 in round numbers, but not a
single dollar has been paid cf such
penalties, while on the contrary the
trial expenses of four of these deiicient
vessels, amounting to 525.4S9 La, were
paid by the Government. Under the
old system the contractor escaped the
payment of penalties and received
handsome speed premiums, but since
1S95 the Government has saved the
premiums and obtained probably as
good and speedy vessels as were turned
out prior to Ib95. The contracts en
tered into since July, 1S94, have appar
ently been framed with due regard to
the rights and obligations to both par
ties, but in their execution the Govern
ment interests have been Ignored. It
Is not aJone that time limits have been
extended again and again and thus the
penalty for non-delivery on time has
been waived, but incompetent builders
have had the effrontery to make claims
upon the Government for failures in
speed aiid other contract stipulations
for which the builders themselves were
responsible. It is within the limit to
state that not less than $4,000,000 Is
thus involved and is likely to be al
lowed by the compassionate House and
Senate.
PENALTIES ARE XOT PAID.
the yrogress on the Boston built vessel
has been more rapid, the relative state
of completion being on August 1 at 57
and 43.4 per cent. It behooves Mare
Island to make good its claim ad
vantages over Eastern yards and es
tablish a better record in shipbuilding.
Mare Island is as well equipped as the
Boston yard, and the superior climatic
conditions here ought to offset the dis
advantages in getting less prompt de
livery of mate-rial. There was a simi
lar discrepancy between the tugs Pen
tucket, built at Boston, and the Soto
yomo, built at Mare Island, which may
have been due to more active superin
tendence of work, but whatever the
causes may he the California navy yard
appears to be handicapped, and reme
dies should be applied.
The failure of some recent ships of
the United States navy to come up to
the contract requirements of structural
strength and speed has suggested the
propriety of returning to the premium
system, which was discontinued ten
years ago. Much as the contractors
would desire it, the system is not likely
to be reintroduced and the better plan
would be to enforce the payment of
penalties for failures in timely delivery,
speed and proper strength of vessels.

tract between 1SS5 and lS'Jo, twenty

A BATTLE OF BOILERS.
The British Boiler Commission has
submitted its final report after exhaus
tive and expensive trials, covering a
period cf four years. It concedes that
the water tube boiler has military ad
vantages over cylindrical boilers: re
peats its recommendation roado In
May, 1SC2, that no more boilers of the
Belfeville type be used in the navy, and
unanimously . recommend the Babcock
& Wtlcox and the Yarrow large-tube
types for naval requirements. Admiral
.Sfr Compton Dourvllle. president of the
committee, however, states In his pre
fece: "My experience with the Belle
ville boilers on the Mediterranean sta
tion has been very favoraJale to them as
a Btefem generator and it Is clear to me
that the earlier boilers of this descrip
tion were badly constructed and badly
used." This statement is not easy to
reconcile with his approval of the com
mittee's report and it Is evident that
the conclusions and recommendations
are not entirely based on facts, for
while the Babcock & Wilcox boiler is
unquestionably the most desirable, it
is not more economical than the Belle
ville and the latter has proved itself
much less of a coal consumer than the
Yarrow type. The remarkably good re
pults of the Belleville boiler in the
Fpartiat* and Diadem proved that with
proper handling this type was equal to
the best water-tube boiler, yet the
committee selects the Yarrow boiler,
the. serviceable qualities of which, In
large ships. Is still unknown. Experi
ments were made with the box, or
Fcotch cylindrical boiler, and water
tube of Belleville. Babcock & "Wilcox.
N'iclausse and the Yarrow types, and
while the comparative inefficiency of
the cylindrical has been demonstrated,
the conclusions regarding the other
types are unsatisfactory and a "battle
of the boilers" between rival makers is
certain to be waged again with more
v!por than at any time during the pre- I
ceding controversy.
DELAY IN* SHIPBUILDING.
The Cumberland, training ship of 1S00
tons displacement, was launched at the
Boston Xavy Yard August 17. and Is
about F.5 per cont completed. Congress
authorized on March 3, 1903, the con
struction of two steel training ships and
one wooden brig, allowing $370,000 for |
Â«=arh of the steel vessels and $50,000 for
the brl:?. The latter, named Boxer, is
l.ping built Ml thÂ«? Portsmouth Navy
Yard, and the Cumberland and Intrepid I
at Boston and Mare Island. It was es- I
tlmated that the Boxer would be com
pleted by Juno 30 last and the others by
May I. 1003, but owing to non-delivery
of material and ether causps there was
considerable delay in starting the work.
The Intrepid at Mure Island has been
most unfortunate In this respect, for
v.hilo tho keel Â«Â»f the Cumberland was i
laid in November last, the Intrepid was
not'begun until January 3. Then, again, ]

Desipr.s of the two battleships of the
LÂ«oid Nelson claÂ«s for the British navy
have been completed and their princi
paj <ltta.ils announced in the House of
mrnonw. They are to have a normal
u replacement of 16,500 tons, a speed of
J knots and an armament of four 12
:ch and ten 9.2-inch guns. Theso bat- |
s ere the most formidable yet J
placed in ar.y ship and are far more 1
fÂ«r K^ns rar.pe fighting than ;

Slates navy. The normal displacement
< :" ihe live American battleships is 16.
'Â¦ J ions, on which they carry four 12- i
inch, eig-ht Â£-:nch and twelve 7-inch
Â¦ guns. The range and per.etratir.g \
power cf the British ar.d American 1-- \
iuca gun is practically alike, but the .
â¢ range and power of the 9.2-inch gun !
D makes the S-inch ar.d 7-inch guns com- t
paratively ineffective at a range of
Â»t-hreÂ« to 'our miles.
The four British armored cruisers to
*>Â£ bt:i2t are alsy an advance on the
Duke of Edinburgh class. They are
to be known as the Minotaur class and
. will displace 14,600 tons. Their speed |
:s to be S3 knots ar.d their batteries will
consist cf four 9.2-ir.ch and ten 7.c-inch
cur.s. The American armored cruisers
Tennessee and "Washington displace 14.
: 50D tons and are calculated to steam 22
kpots and their armament consists of
â¢ four- 10-inch ar.d sixteen 6-inch Runs.
The greater speed of the British ships
if realized, gives them a distinct ad
vantage in selecting a range at -which
the 6-inch guns of American Ehips
vcu'.d be ineffective.
â¢Seventeen torpedo-boat destroyers
have be*r. added to the British navy
Â»lnce January. 1902, and two more are
c rrady for their steam trials. Two of
â¢ # the accepted boats are fitted with tur

â¢ therefore, differ in size, but the speed

The Insertion into their platforms of
the San Francisco "seawall plank" by
the two political parties of the State
has brought tho great question of this
harbor's improvement once more to thf
front. It is now a second step nearer
the people, before whom it must stand
for approval at the next general elec
tion. The first step was taken when
the last Legislature authorized a 4 per
cent bond issue to provide funds for the
completion of the seawall and docks on
the water front of this city. The third
and last will be when this bond issuÂ«
comes up for popular approval in No
vember.
For ytars the successive Boards of
Harbor Commissioners have labored
faithfully on San Francisco's seawall.
Beginning at the western end of Meiggs
wharf this line of solid concrete has
been built, yard by yard, in a southerly
crescent to Folsom street. Substantial
wharves on supports of metal and ma
sonry have followed in the march of
improvement. Splendid piera reach out
into th<- bay. anJ crowning all this la
the nÂ«jrÂ«le ferry building at the water
gateway of the city.
Fur want of tho necessary funds the
work stopped at the Folsom street
docks, and from that point around the
crescent line of the front to Second
street the old and worn wooden
wharves, with the toredo-eaten timbers
and uneven plank approaches, are still
used. At Second street two modern
piers, each S00 feet long, to be occupied
by the Pacittc Mail Company, will" be
constructed and a seawall at that point
is being built. The work mapped out
by the board if the bond proposition
meet the voters' approval is the con
struction of 4 400 feet of wall, that will
approximately cost $770,000; paving and
curbing East street, 120 feet wide, and
the 4400 feet along the new seawall,
costing about $125.006; building thirteen
modern cylindrical piers along the new
wall, havins a total length of 3600 feet
and a width of 120 feet, amounting to
$1,105,000, the total cost aggregating $2,
000.000.
VAST WHARFAGE CREATED.
These Improvements will create eight
new seawall blocks, as there will be
large spaces between the new wall and
the shore end. and these can be filled
in rapidly after the concrete work is
completed. The area thus reclaimed
will be about 357,490 square feet, equiva
lent to twenty fifty-vara lots, which
will be rented for commercial purposes.
This will increase the harbor improve
ment fund revenue something Ilka $60,
000 a year and would be worth over
Jl ,000.000. There will be an additional
having to the Harbor Commission be
sides the rentals of th^seawall lots.
About $25,000 a year is spent at present
in -maintaining pile and plank drive
ways and bulkheads. The life of a pile
dock is ten years. The average cost of
one of these structures is $70,000, and
thus it dies at the rate cf $7000 a year.
All new dock3 will be built with the
cement and metal cylinder supports,
which are almost Imperishable. Instead
of the decaying wooden pile of a past
decade. The total saving In wharf re
pairs and the increased revenue from
the rental of the new seawall lots will
amount of JS5.000 a year. This will pay
the interest on the proposed $2,000,000.
It may not be generally known
throughout the State, but It is a fact
that the water front of San Francisco
is self-supporting. The running ex
penses and the vast sums paid for im
provements In the past have come from
the earnings of the docks â the rental*
and the toll*. The bonds and the an
nual interest on the same will be paid
out of the seawall sinking fund, which
the commission must maintain for tha
bond redemption. In no other way
will the proposed bond Indebtedness
be liquidated. Xot one cent can bo
appropriated from other sources, and
not one cent will be added to tha voter"!
taxation.
FINANCIAL REFORM.
The present method of getting money
for large improvements is by vlrtua of
the law authorizing the Stato Harbor
Commission to anticipate Its revenua
for fifteen years and issua warrants
apainst the future. There la no pro
vision in the law that allows the com
mission to pay interest, so, of course.
the contractor adds the Interest aoÂ»
count to the cost of the work, and, fur
thermore, it narrows the field of com
petition dov.n to a few contractors who
have the working capital and can afford
to carry the Harbor Commission's war
rants. There is another needless ex
pense that will be cut away when the
board has its own money for use. At
the present time when a new dock Is
absolutely necessary the future lessee
Is asked to settle for it and hold out
his pay from the yearly rents and tolls.
The port of San Francisco, -when these
proposed improvements are made, will
have the best and most complete dock
accommodations of any port in the
world, and the shipping of the future
will find at her seawall all the needs of
commerce supplied.

race.
Fifteen hundred people witnessed the
race, which was brimful of excitement.
After the first relay of five miles, Mer

the first half mile Mershon caught and
passed him. From that time on the
visitors stood no chance. Three tlme3
the Reno riders punctured tires, but
even this did not prevent them from
constantly increasing their lead. De

A series of minor accidents marred
the twenty-foot-class, which was won
by Harry Brlndle's little salmon boat
Frolic. The other two starters, the
Anita, owned by E. Fratgo, and the
Pollywog, owned by Tyler and Bixby,
met with mishaps which put them out
of the race. The Pollywog lost her
rudder at the start, xhe Anita shipped
so much water off Mission Rock that
Tyler, who was sailing her, was forced
to give up and run for the clubhouse.
The course of the owners' cup race
was from the Oakland mole, around
Alcatraz Island and Mission Rock to
the Alameda mole, twelve miles in all.
The twenty-foot-class race was sailed
on the course from the Oakland mole
around Mission Rock, thence to the
Alameda mole. The water was fairly
smooth, although a stiff breeze was
blowing during all the races.
The owners' cup race and class flag
regatta of the California Yacht Club
was sailed yesterday afternoon under
weather conditions that were all 'that
could be desired.
The Jessie E, owned by John Rosen
feld, covere* herself with salt spray
and glory, winning the owners' cup
and also the thirty-six-class flag in
two hours and three minutes. Close
behind her came the Iola, owned by
Robert Vincent, and the Gypsy, owned
by Charles E. Clark. All three boats
finished seconds apart, the race being
closely contested from the start.
The thirty-foot-class flag was cap
tured by the Gypsy, owned and sailed
by Charles E. Clark, he having entered
his yacht in both the owners' cup race,
which was open to all classes, and in
the class event.
Some one in the crowd cried "fake"
when Brenton appeared at the front
of the stage and offered to bet $100
he could throw any man in the house
in ten minutes.
DES MOIXES, la., Aug. 28. â Ex-
Mayor James Brenton of Des Moines
threw James Parr, champion wrestler
of England, last night in eight min
utes, Becuring a haif-Nelson and bear
ing his 350 pounds of weight . down
upon the sprightly young English
man's shQulders.
The match was for three rounds of
fifteen minutes each. Parr to throw
Brenton best two in three. The ex-
Mayor and County Superintendent of
Schools, despite his portly pro
portions, exhibited some clever breaks
from Parr's holds and managed to
battle against the Englishman for nine
minutes before his shoulders went
down in the second round..-â
James Brenton's Enormous Weight
and Strength Prove Too Much

The taming of the Tigers has been
the essence of simplicity for the Seals
this week at Recreation Park. The I
Jungle monsters went away last night
so pacified and so amiable that they
won't be recognized in Tacoma. It was
hard enough for the Horseshoe Kid to
drop twice, on Friday and Saturday,
but when the sun had set yesterday
and 6till the Tigers had not worked off
a heavy balance on the ledger, Mr.
Fisher was as disconsolate a magnate
as ever figured on winning a pennant.
Scores: Morning game, San Francisco
7, Tacoma S; afternoon game, San
Francisco 2, Tacoma 0.
It was just because Brother Joe
Corbett twisted 'em better than did
giant Overall that the Tigers knew not
what the home plate looked like in the
afternoon game. The vast army of fans
which came to see the rival stars in
action were rewarded and doubly so,
for the home team achieved a victory
that was worthy of their efforts.
At that the game was close all the
way and might have been broken up
by either team had a batting rally de
veloped. Only in one inning, the sixth,
was there any hitting done. Then the
former idol of Berkeley town tossed
'em up to the plate so easily that the
Seals swatted three to remote corners
of the lot and added two runs to their
share.
Corbett started the game in a way
that made the fans groan. He walked
Doyle and Irwin immediately fumbled
Sheehan's tap. Then Brother Joe sent
a slant against the ribs of Nordyke and
a full house resulted. Fast baseball
and good headwork prevented runs.
Eagan hit to short and Doyle was
gobbled at the plate. Lynch fanned
and Miller put an end to the Tigers'
glee by scooping up Casey's fa'st one
and ending it there.
After that the Tigers never had a
peep in. Corbett began to discern the
Plata more clearly and the Tigers' eyes
grew dim when those big outcurjres
sped swiftly past. The whole team
took a. brace and played baseball.
The Tigers roared and stormed with
anger when the Seals slipped one over
on them in the third. Corbett beat a
bunt and Sheehan hurled the ball into
the bleachers, letting Joe land on sec
ond. Again the leather was hit to
Sheehan, this time by Van Buren.
Again Tommy's toss was a weird one,
so Corbett tallied for Uncle.
A battle of pitchers ensued for a
couple of rounds when the Seals broke
into the going once again. Brother
Joe started it with a smash to left and
Van Buren laid one down. Gochnauer's
out put Joe up one and Waldron's
two cushloner let him In. Hildebrand
swung through with another and the
three runs were then a reality.
After that the Tigers were in. Doyle
smashed for two in the eighth, but
there was no one to assist him in.
Seven of them fanned wind in trying
to get jerry to the wide ones Corbett
was winging in and most of them ex
pired by the ancient pop fly route.
Both teams did some clever fielding at
critical times. Sheehan and Irwin, the
rival third basemen, shared the mis
Â¦ plays between them, each committing
a pair of blunders. The score:

leside Coursing Park yesterday Queen
of Isle dropped dead upon the field.

courses. The third went to the Queen

The tennis players availed of their
opportunity yesterday to practice for
the forthcoming championship tourna
ments. The courts in this city and in
San Rafael were taxed to their ca
pacity.
On the San Rafael courts, where the
tournaments will be played, the feature
was a doubles, in which the contending
teams were Drummond MacGavin and
Percy Murdock and Will Allen and
George Baker. MacGavin and Murdock
are considered the strongest team, but
their play yesterday was hardly up to
expectations. In the morning they won
three sets out of five from Al
len and Baker. In the afternoon the
latter turned the tables and won two
out of a three-set match. Baker and
Allen are not as good individually as
either Murdock or MacGavin, but the
latter by no means outclassed them.
If MacGavin and Murdock meet some
easy teams in the early rounds they
will probably work into form. If, how
ever, they draw the best team from
the south they^will have to play better
than they did yesterday to win.
On the California Club courts nearly
all of the "regulars" were out, and in
many cases the players had to double
up. The best match was a doubles, in
which George Janes and Herbert Long
were opposed to Frank Mitchell and
Melville Long. The match resulted in a
tie, each side winning two sets.
Long and Janes are developing into a
strong team and another year will put
them right up with the best players.
They play well under handicap condi
tions, both giving and receiving odds,
and with more practice will beÂ«hard to
beat. Melville Long is another young
ster who is coming to the front. He
played with a first class man and
against two of the best men in the sec
ond class, but he was by no means out
classed. He gavG Mitchell good sup
port and played like a veteran. Mitch
ell and Long won the first and fourth
sets and Long and Janes the second
and third.
B. Nourse, a crack from Boston, who
recently joined the club, won two sets
out of three from Harry Butler. After
losing the first set by a small margin
the Eastern man took the next two.
Nourse's dally practice has improved
his game wonderfully in the last
month.
Harry Rolfe, playing from "15" back
of scratch, allowed W. G. Knowlton.
the New Zealand champion, odds of
"30" and won two sets. Rolfe's careful
game allowed the champion few oppor
tunities to score.
George Janes and Melville Long
played four fast sets. Young Long
played his opponent a close match and
took the third set handily.
Al Kenyon again tried to beat Knowl
ton with "30," but, as in their last
meeting, Knowlton carried off the hon
ors by a small margin.
The Bcores follow:
. George Janes beat Melville Long 6-3. 6-4,
3-6 6-4; B. Nourse beat Harry Butler 9-11.
C-n. 7-5; A. C. Bozarth beat Gus Hlsser G-2.

7-5.
In a letter received from Champion
Bell he stated that he will be here if
possible to defend his title to the sin
gles championship on the 9th. He is
playing in the East at present, and it is
doubtful if he will be able to get here
in time to defend.

Frisky Barbara, a daughter of the
Imported English . greyhound Fortuna
Favente, won the stake at Union
Coursing Park yesterday from Don
nybrook in a trial lasting more than
two minutes. Frisky Barbara was a
one to four choice and led by twenty
lengths. The hare proved so strong
that the fleet dogs could get but few
turns out of it. The hare took them
completely around the field and back
to the slips.
It started up the field again with
Frisky Barbara in close pursuit. Don
nybrook commenced to lag here and
finally fell. When his trainer reached
him he was dead. He had unusually
hard running during the day and the
strain proved too much for him.
The winner beat in turn Peter Mc-
Intyre, Adonis, Colored Lady, Fair
Tralee, Amandan, Lucy Clair and then
Donnybrook.
There were the usual number of
upsets in the betting. Shadow beat
the one to four choice Golden For
tune and followed this in the next
round by beating Fancy Free, the one
to five favorite. Idleness beat Rural
Artist; Son of Erin beat Don Pedro;
Golden' Light beat John Heenan; Col
ored Lady beat Conroy; Idleness beat
Orsina, and Amandan beat Hudson,

Special Eli patch to Tb* CalL
XEW YORK, Aug. 25. â Turf men,
discussing the Futurity, say that while
it was a matter of gratification to the
owners cf Artful, the public at large
Â¦wculd have been better pleased If Tan
ya could have won, for no such conces
sion of weight was claimed for Tanya
as was chimed for Artful. It is not
certain, however, that Artful could
have won if she had carried the weight
which was borne by Tanya, by Syson
by or by Tradition.
Unstinted praise was bestowed upon
Tradition, as she carried the full pen
alty of eight pounds imposed upon her
by th'e conditions and yet ran so good
a^ second. No less praise was forth
coming foY Sysonby, which lost sec-;
ond p*!ace in the last few strides, after
Hying In vaia to defeat every one of
his opponents which aspired to pace
nifikir.c. It was claimed by some that
Sysonby lost because from his position
on the extreme outside he was required
to cover more ground than any other.
It has been noted of late that the
starting barrier is placed at such an
apparent aji'gle as to appear to nullify
the advantage held by the Inside
horses, those on the outside being: ap
parently eight cr ten feet In front of
those on the Inside. This Is no doubt
the case a.t the start, for all races run
ovÂ«r the Futurity course, hence It can
not readily be accepted as a fact that
any horse on the outside has much, if
any, the worst of it, as compared with
those on bis left.
Judging by the unprecedented Fu
turity crowd of Saturday, the meeting
at the Coney Island Jockey Club's
course will be highly successful from
a financial standpoint and scarcely less
so frcm a racing standpoint We are
promised a Fight of the famous Bel
dame to-morroiv. The Twin City Han
dicap, on Wednesday, should bring a
grrat field to the post, especially as the
stake is more valuable than ever be
f.^e. The winner will receive more
than $12. OW*. while there is 52000 for the
second and $1000 for the third.

Charles Gardner, a newsboy, had a
miraculous escape from death yester
day morning under the wheels of an
Eddy street car. In response to a
signal from a woman on the opposite
side' of the street he started across
the car tracks to sell a copy of The
Call. He failed to: notice an ap
proaching car and being deaf did not
hear the clanging of the gong or the
warning shouts of the motoimun.
' The car knocked the boy down and
when it was brought to a stop, he, was
found wedged in the front truck. The
passengers .thought he had been
killed. They secured scantlings from
an adjacent lumber pile and pried up
the car in order . to release the boy.
When he was finally dragged from his
perilous position it was found that he
had escaped serious injury.
Mrs. L. Muston of the Apollo Ho
tel witnessed the accident and tele
phoned to the Central Emergency
Hospital for, the ambulance. She also
notified the Fire Department. The
members of Truck' Company No. 3
were quickly on the scene, but the
boy had been -released before their ar

Emergency Hospital, where- a /few
slight wounds on his head and.hands
were dressed.

The brevity of their stay prevented
the Oregon Commandery arranging a
formal programme of entertainment,
and as it was the wish of the visit
ing Knights they were taken in car
riages and on the cars about the city
and to the Lewis and . Clark fair
grounds. . In the afternoon they were
served with a biiffet luncheon and
then visited the new Masonic Cathe
dral.-
The Denver Commandery is expect

j An adaptation of Ouida's thrilling
1 story. "Under Two Flags," was given
by the Neill company at the Grand
Opera-house last night. While the
play has been seen here many times it
is always welcome and was greeted
Â¦ with a crowded house last night. Neill
' takes the leading role, that' of Bertie

â¢ all. Harry Cashman's work as Rake.

\ commendable: In fact there does not

; parts In the play are well taken. Dur
ing the performance Neill paused to
administer a well merited rebuke to a
number of hoodlums in the gallery,
â¢ who persisted in insulting the ladies on
the stage. His remarks were received
with applause by the audience aHTl the
play proceeded without further inter
ruption. It is on for the week and
I should have a good run.
The leading feature at the Orpheum
yesterday was the spectacular and
sensational military act billed as "Our
Boys in Blue," which was brought in
its entirety direct from Boston, where
it created a furor week before last at
Keith's, during the encampment of the
Grand Army of the Republic. Fifteen
sturdy young men, garbed in the regu
lation United States uniform, were em
ployed and gave some exceedingly diffi
cult drilling, covering not only the
manuel of arms, but also showing great
celerity and precision of intricate move
ments. The drill corps of the various
Knights Templar Commanderles could
undoubtedly get some pointers from
these youths, who hall from Indiana-
Six others gave artillery drill and
there was a lively bit of wall scaling,
in which a Red Cross nurse was car?
rled up, holding the American flag,
amid hurrahs from the excited and
thoroughly enthused audience. "Our
Boys in Blue" is the best thing of the
kind ever presented in San Francisco.
Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Kelcy are back
with an amusing sketch, entitled "A
Young Parson's Predicament," and
Paul Barnes, an affable monologist in
a tramp makeup, held his auditors
laughing for twenty minutes. Harry
Klein and Pearl Clifton, a Umber
limbed dancing dco. made a hit and the
Musical Goolmans were warmly ap
plauded. Max and Julia Heinrich were
heard in melodies and Eva Williams
and Jac Tucker repeated their hit of
last week in "Skiriny's Finish." Al:

too beautiful as Angel Clare. In fact,
it is a case here of rival beauties in the
leading men. Still, I think Mr. Hender
son has It. He Is even more lovely than
White Whittlesey. He is not much else
as Angel Clare but something for Tess
to hang her arms round. The smaller
parts, again, are unusually well filled
in. though needing a little toning down.
William Teranse is capital as John
Ducbeyfleld. amazingly lifelike. So, too,
is Louise Royce as Joan Durbeyfleld.
Bertha Blanchard shows considerable
temperament as Marion, though
drunken scene does most credit to her
inexperience. The rest are well in key
with their work, and a remarkable de
gree of atmosphere is attained in the
performance. The houses promise to be
record ones this week.

Clad in uniforms of black and silver
and mounted on coal black steeds two
troops of Sir Knights yesterday went
through some showy evolutions on Van
Ness avenue. Under command of Kir
Knight William H. Edwards, they
wheeled, trotted and galloped over the
smooth roadway with the precision of a
crack battalion of dragoons.
The troops comprised Oakland Com
mandery No. 11 and Golden Gate Com
mandery No. 16. These organizations
will form part of the official escuit dur
ing the Triennial Conclave of the
Knights Templar.
They were reviewed yesterday by the
grand commandor of California, W.
Frank Pierce, the deputy grand com
mander of California; John B. de Jar
nett. Grand Generalissimo B. P. Flint.
Grand Standard-Bearer JI. D. Loveland
and members of the executive commit
tee of the conclave.
Many early to the conclave
were also in'the reviewing stand at
Sutter street and Van Ness avenue.
The blare of the bugles, the clatter of
hoofs and the silver stars glittering in
the sunlight attracted quite a number
of people, who were leaving the
churches just as the drill began. Hun
dreds ptonped to watch it.

Just what might have been ex
pected /from Miss Roberts' comfort
able, sincere and engaging talent hap
pened with her "Tess of the d'Urber
viiles" last night at the California
Theater. 7
Some three years ago at the same
theater Mrs. Fiske presented the play.
With it Miss Roberts last night opened
her usual summer engagement to an
audience that filled every seat in the
house. The popular little actress was
welcomed in the usual hearty fashion
and as usual deserved all she got.
But Miss Roberts is not Mrs. Fiske â
in which there is more than meets
the eye. Nor, with all due respect, is
Mrs. Fiske Miss Roberts â comparison
being better fun>^han criticism here.
The matter is intimately one of per
sonality. Mrs. Fiske could not, for
instance, with her tense, brilliant lit
tle face and supremely mental art,
ever quite succeed in suggesting the
utter naivete of the Tess of the earlier
scenes of the play. Here Miss Rob
erts is charmingly successful. She
brings a freshness, simplicity, tender
ness that engage immediately the pity
and sympathy of the auditor for the
unhappy girl. One never quite felt
that Mrs. Fiske's Tess could be so
hardly treated. One felt she could
help herself and everybody else.
From the moment, however," -when
Tess sells herself to Alec for her starv
ing family, Mrs. Fiske's moment be
gan. And there Miss Roberts' ended.
Tn the pleasure of the first two acts
one begins to hope that the big third
would also go. Can she? â one kept
asking erne's self, as In simple, woman
ly and appealing fashion, with a right
strong note where Tesa goes "out into
the night" with Alec, the part was
built up. But that tense magnetism
that holds the scene without a word
is not Miss Roberts.* Where Tess takes
the too-long economized carving knife
to Alec there were not a few laughs.
Never, as with Mrs. Fiske, did one
feel the supreme nervous goad of the
situation. It is quite possible, how
ever, that the' scene will strengthen,
and the characterization will certainly
be enjoyed as it is, in its charming
first scenes of the best of Miss Roberts'
work.
The supporting company In part Is
excellent. Miss Roberts has Hobart
Bosworth, former leading man with
Mrs. Fiske, as leading man, and as
with Mrs. Fiske, the Alec d'Urber
ville.
Mr. Bosworth Is an admirable brute
where brute he needs to be, otherwise

Orpheum Presents Meritor
ious Bill for the Week.
Neill Company at Grand
The funeral of the late Rudolph
Schultze, who was foully shot and
killed by Gustav Scherf on Wednesday,
August 24, took place yesterday from
the family residence. 113S Fifth avenue,
South San Francisco. There was an
enormous assemblage of sympathizers
with the bereaved family within and
outside the residence, and when the
cortege arrived at Masonic Hall, at
Railroad and Fourteenth avenues,
there were fully 200d persons present.
The officers and members of South
San Francisco Lodge Xo. 212, Free and
Accepted Masons, marshaled by Dr. D.
B. Todd, and members of San Francisco
Chapter No. 1, Royal Arch Masons, and
members of the Master Mariners' Be
nevolent Association attended- the sol
omn exercises in the Masonic Hall,
Â¦where Worshipful Master William Mc-
Donald and numerous prominent Ma
sons took part in the profound ceremo
nies.
Rev. H. N. Bevier. pastor of the Me
morial Presbyterian Church, delivered
a eulog-y. in which he recited the jjood
deeds performed by the departed, and
laid particular stress upon his love and
devotion for his family and all home
ties, tie said in part:
Sorrow ncfia simple word* for its comfort
*Â»id EiLij-le Â»t>rds are all that may be spoken
â¢t this hour. Our hearts are too heavy to
listen Ions and our words will be as few as
finiple.
Sad and terrible was the manner of our
friend's tai:::s cflf; cowardly and dastardly
r.as the dÂ»<?d that took his life; malicious and
exxrta was the fDirlt of the assassin in his
< ruel thirst for blood.
Such an hour beloncs of riffht chief.y to
thoÂ»e who knew and loved him best, but a
'public cart is given to this assembly, both
by the large cumber of citizens present and
because it was, a public servant engaged in a
public duty that tired the shot that took our
friend's life. It if therelore fitting to say
that there Is something- wrong- with the ad
ministration of public order when such men
*f thi one who committed this deed is per
mitted to b? cmi)loyed in any arm of the
public service. It was said by th* lamented
and btloved C&rfield, who was struck down
by the bullet of an assassin, that the public
safety demands the fountains of political
power ehould be made pure, by intelligence
Â«r.d ktpt cure by vigilance" and underneath
th<_- shadow of such a public dishonor every
Â«ood citizen will feel not only that tlv*
