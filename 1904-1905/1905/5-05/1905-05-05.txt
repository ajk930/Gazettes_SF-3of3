In the Senate for many years was the
defeat of one and the passage of six of

â¢ The bill fixing a maximum price for

emended, without opposition, so as to
make the rate SO cents a thousand, in
stead of 75, as in the original bill, and
then was defeated.

DENVER, May 4.â News received by
J. Mcsler, a business man of Chicago
vho is visiting in Denver, recalls the
big "gold extraction" excitement
worked up three years ago in this city
by "Professor" Wynne and Sidney Wil
liams, by means of which several of
the most prominent citizens of Denver
and Chicago lost thousands of dollars
after being convinced, for the time be-,
ing at least, that "Professor" Wynne
had mastered the secrets of alchemy.
Through a letter from a friend in j
Los Angeles, Mosier, whÂ«-wÂ«ts*tMie v Â«f i |
the Wynne- Williams investors, learns]
that, under another name, "Williams,"!
who first went to Japan and was aft- j
.erward reported dead,. Is in Los Ah--;
geles introducing the same old "gold^
extraction" scheme that worked so well
In this city. The method of procedure
Is reported to be exactly similar to that
exploited here by Wynne and pro
moted by Williams.
"The Wynne Gold Extraction- Com
pany" guaranteed to extract gold from
ordinary earth, from ground-up;brick
bats â in fact, from almost any; "ma
terial. In making the "demonstra
tions" it was only necessary to; secret
ly impregnate the matter treatedjwlth
some sort of liquid gold and -then by
chemical treatment solidify It into the
form of genuine; gold "buttons." . â¢ '\u0084
Wynne.dled and Williams claimed to
have -the; only, bona fide formula of the
process. ' He and one or twq,!associates
formed a company "and- sold stock.
Wfien it- became apparent that the pub
lic was getting j suspicious, . ] Wllllamsr
who was a man .of large family, left
the city. It . was said 'that he carried
away with him.. $30,000, that had' been
paid for the Wynne stock. '\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0. \u25a0\u25a0--. '-'Â»., -C\
Mosier is undecided as to how to pro
ceed-in the case. of Williams, but he
says that he may communicate with
the Los Angeles authorities and ask for
the man's arrest. . â.'

INDIANAPOLIS, May 4.â Dr. James
John, an alumnus of the medical col
lege here, last winter presented the col
flege -with $130,000 worth of stock of the
Oro Carita Mining and Milling Com
"jpany of California, a corporation which
the had organized and had capitalized
: for $3,000,000. The college sold the stock
'^at 50 cents on the dollar and lent Dr.
(John $15,000 to meet expenses while- In
'Indiana. While spending the $15,000
John met a young girl in an Anderson
Store and created a sensation by offer-
ing to adopt her and educate her.
In the trial of Charles E. Winnie,
charged with having embezzled part of
the school funds, Dr. John admitted
that he owned nothing to back the Oro
Carita Company but a hill sixty-five
miles from Los Angeles, Cal., which he
had never visited, but which was said
to contain gold. At the time he formed
the corporation he was living in a tent
near Los Angeles and did not have
enough money to pay for the incor
poration of the company.
The stock sold by the medical college
was taken by friends of the institution.

- Othd"; Z. Mitchell pleaded guilty â¢in
Judge Lawlor"s court yesterday to. a
charge jof robben*. He was ordered
to appear for sentence on May 13.
Mitchell held up John E. Webster, a
bank-clerk, living at 212- -Ashbury
street,-in front of Webster's residence
on theJiight of March 23 and" during
the struggle with Webster, Mitchell
fired a' shot at him. The shot attracted*
the attention of Webster's father, who
rushed out of the house and assisted
his son and the gripman of a. passing;
cable car in overpowering the footpad.
A good deal of sympathy -was
aroused for the footpad owing to his
statement that he committed the deed
because he was unable to obtain em
ployment and his wife and baby had
been starving. Later the landlady of
the house where Mitchell and his wife
had been living made a statement to
the police contradicting Mitchell's
statement and reflecting upon -the
character! of his wife. ~ \u25a0.

* A QUESTION FOR THE COHB^D
The Associated Redwood Shingle
Manufacturers is the latest .combine
being effected by California lumber
men, and has as its principal purpose
the advancing of the price of green
shingles, which are rapidly becoming
one, of the big products of the State.
This practically means that the new
organization is to carry on a busi
ness war with the Pacific Redwood
Shingle Company. The latter associa
tion was formed a year ago by a num
ber of larsre .lumber firms, including
the Pacific Lumber; Company, the
Northern Lumber" Company, Dolbeer
&. Carson, .Minor ..& Co.. and several
other -biffj concerns." . â¢ I
r A> large number of lumber firms re
fused- to p6 r int .Â° the " combine, but
have now formed one of -their own,
claiming that the older concern is
maintaining the price of shingles at
$1.(45 per, thousand, delivered In San
Francisco. ? The new association .wants
the price advanced 20 cents per thou
sand, on the ground that the present
price is barely above^the cost of pro
duction, but how it proposes to effect
this end in the" face of the lower. price
offered by the Pacific Redwood Shin
gle Company is a matter members of
the rival association are not prepared
to make public;. > Among the members
of the new organization are firms like
the Hammond Lumber Company,
Eastern Redwood Company, . Gourley
& Burns of Chicago and Eureka,
Whiting G. Press, Sweitzer & Co., Rob
ert Haughey, McCormick'& Hauptman
Shingle Company and others who .fig
ure prominently in the Pacific Coast

BRIEF CITY NEWS.
.WASHDCGTON, May i. â Secretary
Taft was called on to-day by Julias
Kruttschnitt, director of maintenance
and operation of all the Harrlman
lines, In relation to the application of
the railroads to bridge CarQuinea
Straitfi, connecting San Pablo Bay with.
San Francisco Bay, This project has
c excited deep Interest on the Pacific
Coast. The district engineer nas re
ported to the War Department ad
versely on it.
KruttÃchnitt told Secretary Taft
that he represented three railroad sys
tems, the Central Pacific the Union
Pacific and the Southern Pacific He
JllÂ«d a protest against the action of
thÂ£ district engineer, which was tak
en on the gTound that the proposed
bridge would interfere -with naviga
tJoru He said that a suspension bridge
\u25a0with a 4000-foot span, such as was
demanded by the city of San Fran
&Bco and the engineer, would cost at
least J 10,000,000, while the draw
bridge proposed by the railroads, with
*wo 100-foot passages on either side
of the central draw, could be con
structed for about $1,000,000, The
ro&ds would save an hour's time on
trains running to Ogden and "Oregon.
It was admitted, ne said, that the
; drawbridge would not interfere with
steamship navigation, but only with
the small schooners which carry hay,
gravel and agricultural products to
Kan Francisco and which would be
unable to stem the swift current like
ly to be caused by the drawbridge at
certain stages of the tide. To meet
this objection the railroad companies
offer to maintain a tug to tow them
\u25a0 through the draw free of charge.
\ Secretary Taft will take this matter
tip with General Mackenzie," -the chief
of engineers, at the first opportunity.

HOLBROOK, Ariz., May 4.â The flood
waters of the K Little' Colorado | River
reached their highest; here at 2; o'clock
this mornins and began \u25a0 slowly . reced
ing. All danger^ howr appears to, ~ be
past. f.The damage, to Holbrook will: be
slight, but the town \ was saved by a
very narorw margin, the river cutting
to within ten feet \of the \ residences.
The waters are still wearing away the
banks next to the town, however, and
all hands to-day were working to stop
the cutting/ Wool bags were filled with
sand and dropped over the bank into
the river, forming a riprap.
-At 1 o'clock this morning ; the , Little
Colorado River, â¢ normally a stream of
insignificant proportions, 'was a raging
torrent -four and a half miles wide and
filled to the edges with debris of all de
scriptions froyn the valley above. The
damage to . the rich valley. . through
which the flood"; came .will reach: into
the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The loss to the St Johns community,
where the first dam gave way, is esti
mated at from $200,000 to j $250,000, in
cluding the^oss of the dam. The dam
age at.: Woodruff, ibelow; St. Johns,
where the second dam was carried out,
and the country surrounding it is esti
mated at about $100,000.
The rich valley of the Little Colorado
has suffered almost irreparably. The
loss will fall chiefly upon ' the farmers
and ranchers of the valley and will
total several hundred -thousand .dollars.
It is likely that the country j has been
so devastated \u25a0' that crops for the com
ing season will be an impossibility.
' So far as known there has: been no
loss of life attending > the dam break
with the exception of the one Mexican
reported drowned at St. Johns. The
warning sent ahead of the flood un
doubtedly saved" many, as it enabled
the inhabitants of 'the valley to reach
higher ground a^iead of the water.
The inhabitants of Holbrook are
returning 'to the city, and it is ex
pected by noon > the town will p have
resumed its normal appearance. again.
Household, goods are being unloaded
from the boxcars, where they were
hastily piled with the expectation of
hauling them out to save them from
the flood. â
- The precautions taken' to save the
city from inundation cost the citizens
and the Santa Fe Railway Company a
considerable sum of money,' but the
work was effective. and: '\u25a0\u25a0'â¢ the waters
successfully resisted./ Had the .waters
risen a few feet more early this morn
ing the town -would have; been flooded
and practically wiped out. : There is
much rejoicing among the people of
the town at its fortunate escape. ?

WASHINGTON, May 4. â Another
outbreak of yellow fever on the Isth
mus of Panama was reported to Sec
retary Taft to-day. Three employes of
the canal commission are sick with
the scourge. Two natives died on
April 28 and 29.
The employes stricken are Robert
R. West, deputy audlto'r, G. M. Bar
rett and Charles Leach.^ The outlook
is so serious that the matter was re
ported by cable by Governor Davis of
the canal zone, instead of by mall, as
is the usual procedure.
Recent reports from the isthmus,
however, show that the conditions are
abnormally bad, owing to the ap
proach to a water famine and to the
bad weather. It is believed by the
officials here that the conditions will
Improve steadily and that the Ameri
can colony is now going through its
worst experience.

CbinesÃ Minister
Gatfters Data
for Suit
Sends Out Circu
lar to Countru-
WASHINGTON, May 4.â Sir Chen
tucg Liang Cheng, the Chinese Minis
ter, has issued a confidential circular or
proclamation to all Chinese in the
United States requesting that he be
iurnisked with reports of all cases of
applicants who have been denied per
mission to enter this country and oi all
deportations on the ground of non-reg
i^iration which have been decided since
the expiration of the exclusion treaty
jof 1894. The circular also asks for an
estimate of the damages to the ap
plicants for such refusal on the part of
the United States and for such deporta
tions, holding the acts of the officials
"of this country under the law and in
view of the termination of the treaty ;
and after the rejection of the proposed
consent of the Chinese Government to i
a reasonable â¢ exclusion of Chinese to
be hcetiie to a friendly nation.
The circular, which is written in the
Chinese language, was issued through
the Consul General of China at San
Francisco. Its object, as understood by
the United States, is to facilitate the
collection of evidence on which to base
a suit against the United States to test
the validity, of the existing Chinese ex
clusion law. In what particular the at
tack upon the law is to be made is not
known to the Government officials.
They hold that the right of Congress
to enact laws to exclude from this
country Chinese or anybody else can
not be assailed successfully.
It is held by some lawyers of repute,
however, that there are phases of the
Chinese exclusion law which will not
stand a test In the courts, and it is un
derstood to be the intention of one or
more of the influential Chinese organi
zations in this country to institute legal
proceedings by which the rights of in
dividual Chinese will be adjudicated.

-WASHINGTON, May 4.â J. Randolph
Patterson, father of Nan Patterson, to
day telegraphed to his family, concern
ing the result of: the Jury's delibera
tions In the Patterson case, adding his
belief that the former -how girl shortly
would be at liberty to return home.
Mrs. J. Edward Taylor, sister of Miss
Patterson, said to-day :
"I feel that the defense In Nannie's
case did wrong in not : presenting any
evidence In this trial.-' Knowing, as we
do, that she is innocent, it seems to me
that thei better way would have been
to put forward all the evidence pos
sible."
"Do you expect a letter from Miss
Patterson very soon? 1 ' was asked.
"Yes, Just as soon as Nannie is able
to write to us. . She has been writing
all the time. It is terrible to think that
she could ' not have : been acquitted,"
\u25a0 continued Mrs.- Taylor, "when we know
the truth. But, of course, I suppose it
might have been worse. â¢We comfort
mamma by telling her that Nannie' will
be back soon anyhow and, after 'all,
that is what we want."
Mrs. Taylor said she thought her sis
ter had borne up wonderfully; well.
"I don't see how she ever stood it as
she has," she remarked. "It has been
terrible â more , of a persecution ; than a
prosecution." .-, ; ; -' '\u25a0\u0084'.--. \u25a0H-"i
Mrs. Taylor said that her mother was
in a serious nervous condition, from
which she probably would not recover
until Nannie returned. \u25a0.. "i

GRAZED WOMAN
STARTS FIRES
LOS ANGELES, May 4.â A heavy
westerly gale whichi had been blowing
all day and -which raised an ugly sea
was responsible for a tragedy last
night in the' harbor at Redondo.Vln
which two men- lost their lives. I The
steamer Northland, lumber laden, ar
rived at that port after dark/and so
heavy was the sea that' it was deemed
unsafe ; for her to approach ; either of
the piers. A small boat* was lowered
and in it -two members of the crew,
Nels -Anderson . and H. Roose; left the
vessel: with a mooring line intended to
make it S fast } to \u25a0 a buoy in the i outer
harbor. The sea was very rough and
the men had difficulty in reaching their
boat. They had rowed perhaps .fifty
yards from the vessel, the other, mem
bers of the crew paying out the line to
them, when \an unusually large wave
struck their boat and capsized it, - The
men tried to seize the line, but the sea
swept it from them. Olsen -reached the
overturned boat and clung on for a
time' but a wave lifted j him and the
boat and brought the craft down on
top of . him. He -was seen no more.
Other members of ' the^ Northland's
crew launched another boat and went
to the rescue, ; but by. the time they
reached the spot they couift find- no
.trace of Roose. . \u25a0 , \u0084

TWO SAILORS
ARE DROWNED
NEW YORK, May 4.â There is every
prospect "Nan" Patterson will * be ad
mitted to bail within a few days,
upon the assumption -that she.ls-en
titled to the doubt after two Juries have
failed to agree upon her~ guilt. While
she could- again be arraigned, there "is
very little likelihood of it. with : the
same ..witnesses for the prosecution.^
" Even her lawyers admitted to-day
that she had not. done as well as on
the former trial, when there was an
even division of the jury. Levy de
clared he had" heard, from a reliable
source that seven" Jurors had voted for
conviction of manslaughter in the first
degree and five for acquittal. This was
one of several reports in circulation, all
purporting to-be I authentic. Levy's
figures were more or \u25a0 less : corroborated
by a person .who asserted that" he had
overheard the . Jurors, g while at dinner,
say eeven of; their number >were\ for
conviction, two were not : decided, and
three insisted that they entertained a
reasonable doubt of : her guilt.
One of the court officials said he had
learned positively that only one Juror
had stood for acquittal. * />
No positive steps were taken to-day
toward having "Nan" released on bail,
it being agreed by her counsel and her
father,- that, even though \ bail were
possible at once, it would be better for
the girl to remain quietly in the Tombs
for a 'rest after the ordeal she under
went last night.
During the day alarming reports
were circulated 1 as to Miss Patter
son's condition, but it was said at the
Tombs to-night that it was practically
normal. She shows the -effects of her
trial, ljut is far from a real breakdown.
She spent a large part of the day sleep
ing in her cell, being thoroughly ex
hausted from her long "vigil and ' the
nervous, strain of last night. a
Miss Patterson's lawyers to-morrow
will endeavor to 'reach j an agreement
with, the District" Attorney's office as
to the amount of ball their client shall
be required to give. They say they are
ready to produce a bondsman for any
amount 'within reason.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
Notices have been sent out by the In
. ternitlenal Harvester Company, which
has a twine trust of its own, that its
agents shall sell rone but its twines.
The Pacific Coast manufacturers have
had the advantage of comparative
nearness to the Philippine Islands for
. their hemp supply and also of lower
freight charges on the raw material
than have th<;ir Eastern competitors,
nud have turned out goods of high
quality. This is expected to be a factor
in the contest which has just been in
itiated and v.hich may. in a few weeks,
, jrrow to very large proportions.
All farmers in California and in the
other Statas on the Pacific Coast are
Interested parties. The chances are
that they will be able to lay in a stock of
. binding twine sufficient to carry them
along for eorae tjme and at practical
ly their own prices.
Deprived of the agencies of the In
ternational Harvester Company to
market their goods the programme of
the coast manufacturers is to market
on their own account, through retail
ors, through agents of their own em
ploying and in any other way feasible.
The trouble all comes from an at
tempt, as reported, on the part of the
International Han-ester Company to
take away the trade completely from
. the Tubbs Cordage Company and the
Portland Cordage/Company. The Pa
â¢ tiflc Coast cordage manufacturers are
on the defensive, but are prepared to
put up an extremely pretty fight if ru
niors in that respect are correct.
If the home manufacturers lose they
.^suffer largely; if the International Har
vester Company forces fail in their on
' elaugrht to get all the trade of the coast
In bind'ng twine it will be only at the
end of a prolonged contest.
A great fiprht is on for the market
for binding Usine on the Pacific. Coast.
On one side are arrayed the Portland
Cordage Company and the Tubbs Cord
age Company of this city, home man
ufacturers of cordage and twine. On
the ether side are the International
Harvester Company and its leading
agencies on the Pacific Coast, among
the agencies being D. M. Osborne, Ba
ker & Hamilton, Hooper & Co., the
Deere Implement Company and the
McCormick Harvester Machine Com
pany. \

WASHINGTON, May 4.â The seventh
sess!^.. of the .International Railway
Congress was formally opened, here ty
day by Vice President - Charles W.
Fairbanks, who said in part: . :
Tho xery pleasant duty rvsta upon me i to
welcome you to the * seventh session of ! the
Interrm tior.al Railway - Congress. Your assem
bling is always an event of much significance,
for it brines together men eminent in the
: political, economic and transportation affairs
of the world, to deliberate upon uiemes which
have a very direct and considerable bearing
upon the Interests of mankind.
| The railway is essentially an instrument of
i cur modern civilization. There are many men.
I living who were born prior to the construction
! of the lirtt railway, either In England or the
, United States. It was created to meet an im-
I peratlve demand and its growth has been one
of. the most marvelous developments of re
' cent times.
Not only has the mileage of the railway rap
idiy and vastly increaseu, but there has been
: a milked Improvement In the character of Its
construction and In the method of its opera
tion. Inventive cenius, labor and \u25a0 unlimited â¢
capital have been, employed \u25a0 continually in de
vtsinsj new means of increasing its efficiency
and aaaptlng it to the increasing requirements
of trad* ana commerce.
Science and art, labor and capital, have
wrought a revolution. The work of construc
tion and 'reconstruction Is unending. The road
way, terminals and rolling stocK, suited to
the needs of yesterday, are inadequate for the
necessities of to-day, and still much larger
provision must be made for the requirements ,
of 10-morrow.
The universal, urgent and unremitting de- .
mand Is for increased carrying - capacity, at a
medium cost of maintenance and operation.
JianJ in hand with this goes -the demand for
low rates of transportation.
In the rapid evolution of this great in
strument of civilization it Is 'not unnatural
that abuses should arise. As we survey the
past We can see how much experience and
enlightened Judgment have served to eradi
cate many of tb* wrongs which have existed.
It la too much to expect, where euch an agency
touches the social and industrial Interests of
\u25a0 so many people, at bo many points. - that . all
of the inequalities should have been. removed.
We may hope that a epirit of Justice and
ampler knowledge may lead to the removal of
the present evils and the prevention of evils
in the future
The sessions of the International Railway
Congress are of far-reaching moment.: They
bring into closer fellowship distinguished and
able representatives of many nations in
spired by a wholesome common impulse. . They
bring together those who are engaged in â¢ pro
moting the arts of peace and who are desirous
of edvanc-ing the welXare of mankind. ! They
enlarge the circle of International acquaint
ance and tend to preserve- international amity.
They emphasize the. fact that our common
good is to be promoted by the maintenance'
of a broad fraternal, international spirit.
While deliberating upon methods to promote
the efficiency of the rallwajr let us hope that
yon may cultivate a purpose to promote the
adjustment; through the arbitrament of reaÂ»>n.
so far as may be done consistently with na
tional honor, of those perplexing problems
which sometimes arise to menace the world's
peace. The nation which seeks an honorable
settlement of differences with its neighbors la
some other manner than by the sword is not
decadent: it is not wanting in national virility.
It Is merely manifesting an advanced degree
of civilisation. It is evidencing the fact that.,
the barbaric ntrain has run out of its blood.
The opening ceremony' took place' in
the hallrootn of. the new WUlard Ho- |
tel and was attended by nearly 500!
delegates and as many of their friends. !
Three hundred of the delegates are for- ]
eigners. Every railroad *of importance j
in the world is represented. Vice Presi- \u25a0
dent Fairbanks' words of welcome and â¢
congratulations were followed by ad- â¢
dresses by Stuyvesant Fish, president
of the American section of the con
gress, and by Ernest Girard, temporary
chairman of the permanent commission
of the congress. The five sections
through which the congress is to ac
complish its work of discussion were
organized at once and each will meet !
at 9 o'clock to-morrow to take up the
duties assigned to it. During the aft
ernoon the delegates visited Mount
Vernon and the tomb of Washington
by steamer and in - the evening a pri
vate view of the collection of the Cor
coran Gallery of Art was given.
The discussions of the sections are
conducted behind closed doors, in or
der that there may be no restraint In
expressions of opinions by delegates.
The todes to be - handled are entirely
scientific and technical. The conclusion
reached by a section Â£Â»fter due discus
sion of a topic is abstracted and pre
sented to the general congress at meet-
Ings to be held during the ten days'
term of the session. These conclusions
are printed and constitute the work of
the congress. No explanation of any
nature is enacted by the congress and
no resolutions binding railway manage
ments to any line of policy are con
sidered. *

TO SEND TEAM
A y resolution was adopted thanking
Judge Graham 'or the use of his court
room, and a similar compliment was
paid Superintendent of Schools Lang
don by the evening schools for grant
ing them special and distinct sections.
Miss Strauss held that the sooner for
eigners acquire a conversational knowl
edge of the English language, which Is
their desire, the sooner the spirit of
American citizenship . will pervade
among their children. â¢
Miss Josie Blum's address was a mas
terpiece. Lofty patriotism was incor
porated with her methods of teaching
foreigners the T^nglish language.
W. J. G." Williams' demonstrations of
methods in instrictinK the foreigner in
the art of successfully .conquering the
pronunciation of the mother tongue
was another sample of the interesting
labor of these diligent Instructors.
G. H. Foulks presided over the com
mercial section, and A. H. Mac Donald
was chairman of the graded class sec
tion.
In the discussion of the former Dr.
M. Mahoney and Miss J. Doyle had
many pertinent \suggestlons, and Miss
May Strauss came in with . not only
disciplinarian suggestions so far as
they should affect foreigners, but
delved Into the problem as to the, best
methods of teaching them the English
language.
The evening schools round tables
maintained the distinction they \u25a0won on
the previous evenings for spirited and
vigorous debate and argument.
Miss M. M. Magulre -.vas chairman in
the ungraded class section, where was
taken up "Discipline" and "What Be
sides English Should Be Taught."
The deliberations at the" Mission
High School were largely attended,
and the demonstration in arithmetic
by the children of the Noe Valley and
Sheridan public schools was particu
larly interesting. Miss M. Magner
was chairman, and the teachers with
their respective classes were Miss C.
F. Riordan. principal of the Sheridan
school: Mrs. Lyon, principal of the
Xoe VaJley school: Miss S. A. Gaff

EDUCATING FOREIGNERS.
In a way the imaginative association with
these fictitious persons may.be of greater 'ben
efit than the actual association with real per
sons, for man's instinctive conservatism has
to be taken into account, especially the Aaglo-
Sazcn man's.
Association with mea of pure ideals, con
structive imaginations and good actlor.3 is the
greatest force for developing and establishing
hlph ethical standards, but each man's per
eona] associations ere limited and the school
cannot regulate its puplis". choice of friends.
It can, however, by means of literature teach
ing, put him in touch with the real pulsating
lives of a vast society of noble men and
women in fiction.

The complexion of all the addresses
has been ruddy and vigorous, some
actually teeming with ripe philosophy,

At. the Mission High School yester
day morning the participants In the
varied programme were in punctual
attendance, and the same punctuality
was observe! at the Girls* High
School, where the High School section
for three days deliberated.
C. C Young presided over the Eng

and thÂ«Â» subject, "Literature," was
handled in a manner that called forth
the hearty indorsement of those, who
Were listeners.
Miss A- G. Duffy, in speaking on the
special function of literature, its value
as a raentr.l discipline, its culture

Reward will be paid to any
person who can find one atom
of opium, chloral, morphine,
cocaine, ether or chloroform
in -.any form in any of Dr.
Miles* Remedies.
This reward is offered because
certain unscrupulous persons
make false statements about
these remedies It is under-
stood that this reward applies
only to goods purchased in the
open market, which have not
been tampered with in any way.
Dr. Miles' remedies cure by
their- soothing-, nourishing,
strengthening and invigorat-
ing effects upon the nervous
system, and not by paralyzing
and weakening the nerves as
I would be the case if these' drugs
\u25a0were used.
For this reason D?. ; Miles'
Anti-Pain Pills are universally
considered the best pain remedy
"I have suffered for 25 years with
severe rains In my bead, heart and
back, and have tried everything I
could i?et and could not find any relief
until I got a box cf Dr. Miles' Antl-
Paln Puls. I suffered as long as 12
hours at a time with such severe
pains that I feared I -Would lose my
mind. The AnU-Paln Pills gave me
relief in from 10 to 20 minutes. I do
not have to use Morphine any more.
X wish you would publish this so that
other sufferers may find relief."

Dr. Miles' Anti-Pain Pills are cold by
your druggist, who will guarantee that
the first package will benefit. If It
falls he will return your money.

Four weeks ago McLoud told his
grandchildren that he; would live only
three weeks longer. A week later he
said, VOnly two weeks more." At the
end of another week he remarked.
"Only one week more." He died on the
day predicted, April 29, aged 90.
The first of these was Dan Mounts,
who settled in Nisqually Bottom fifty
years ago. For several months Mounts
had prophesied that he would die dur
ing a certain week, and he did.'
j Philander Washbourne, another old
settler, had latterly resided with
Mounts' family. After the death of
Mounts he became low spirited. Notic
ing that the Mounts girls were prepar
ing, for a Christmas tree and party at
the Nisqually schoolhouse on - Christ
mas eve, he requested, them instead to
have the party on the evening 'of, the
23d, stating that the evening of, the 24th
would be too late for him to see it. He
died on the morning of December 24.
"Old Steilacoom," a Nisqually Indian]
aged 97, had for months declared that
he should die within a week of the
death of his old friend John McLoud, a
white man, for wljomhe had formerly
worked. He died two weeks ago and
six, days before the death of McLoud on
April 29. .

by /John 'Rogers are by! no means idle.
Thirteen options, bonding land out of
Santa â¢ Cruz, * have been filed by the
Southern Pacific Company. The land
thus secured gives the Southern Pacific
a right to! Laguna : Creek, about eight
miles' out of Santa Cruz. Some of
these, options are on land' which must
be used by the people for whom Rog

concerned, however, either â¢ over thl3

manipula'ticrns at Ocean 1 View. The
options held by the Southern Pacific
Company.^will expire about. the middle

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, May 4.â
The students jof Stanford - University
have decided to^ try, the "experiment of
giving a football show'of their own in
San Francisco on the night of the
Intercollegiate game with the Univer
sity of California. In pursuance of this
idea they have offered a. orize of $.50 to
the student who" turns In the ibest/col
lege farce for \ttie' occasion]' ''A 'theater
will be leased* and although ' tlie. parts
will be taken by, amateurs, the play^wiU
be staged in professional style. * .'' ' ;
-The reason: for ; the Jtrial of ; this ex
periment Is the dissatisfaction that has
been expressed "at. 'the . professional
shows that have been formerly selected
by the student^body. It has been! the
custom , for ; the . Stanford . manager \u25a0; to
lease a theater and to have . professlon
als play a ; standard piece". .- But the .
students claim that, on . football night
the lines . of the " prof essionals .do not
sound "' clever to : them because of the
lack of local .color. They would far
rather hear of the fame 6f mighty
cardinal heroes that played , . football
than listen to the praises in "grand
opera of /some ancient 'warrior. They
want to hear bright sayings that are at
the expense of their rival college and
not the ordinary run of new songs. In
short, they still have the football fever
left in them and they want another
chance to see something that will bring
their patriotic feelings to the front with
a. rush. The management has lent a
willing ear to , the dissatisfaction that
has been expressed and has agreed to
try. the new proposition. A distinctly
Stanford i show will be presented next
year by Stanford people.

f BERKELEY, May 4. â Resenting
the entrance of officers who declared
that all the furniture in La Paloma
Hotel, on Shattuck avenue, must be
removed to satisfy creditors, a num
â¢ber of lodgers, including several ,uni
â¢ 'versity students, created such a dis
turbance last night that the aid of
Marshal Vollmer's force was required
* before peace could be restored.
Mrs. E- F. Moraga, who had oper
ated the lodging-house, which is one
of the largest in Berkeley, and patron
ised principally by university men. \u25a0is
said to have left the building with her
family and to have neglected to in
form her lodgers, some of whom had
paid In advance, that the furniture
would be removed last night. - There
was consternation when the patrons of
the establishment found strange men
*in their rooms, removing the furniture,
leaving the lodgers without shelter or
o rooms in which to house their per
sonal belongings.
A number of the lodger? proceeded
to. create a typical "rough house,"
using the flre extinguishers to drench
* the halls with water. Complaint was
made to the police, and Deputies Mo
ran, Bush and Farrar were dispatched
to the hotel. They quelled the dis
turbance without making any arrests.
â¢ Mrs. Moraga. is said to have relin
quished control of the furniture in La
Paloma Hotel to the Brilliant Com
pany of . San Francisco, having failed
to make payments due. An auc
tioneer company of Oakland, to whom
the property was assigned, took
charge of the goods last night. Later
the guests were quartered at the Berk
* shirt, pn Bancroft way.

shared his discontent. "It is not a
pleasant thing." she once remarked to
him, "to find folk sniffing the smoke
from your kitchen chimney in order to
. find out what you're having for din
ner." She, too, was of urban breeding.
. Thus it came to pass that on last
Tuesday evening Mr. Townsen, believ
ing that an immediate ajid radical
change of environment was essential
to retention of his sanity, informed
Mrs. Townsen and the offspring that he
had been summoned to repair to this
city, his presence here being necessary
to tto** transaction of important busi
ness, and that he could not possibly re
turn to Redwood before the day to fol
16v.\ His falsehood went unquestioned,
and after kissing the loved ones au
revoir he placed a pint of whisky in
one of his pockets, a revolver in an
other and boarded the dummy of an
â¢ electric car. Satisfaction over the sue
'â¢ ctss of his ruse, combined with an ex
hilarant sense of freedom and the joy
*'ous anticipation of a good time,
prompted him to frequent consultation
of his liquor bottle, and ere -the Journey
was half siÂ»ent he was half-drunk and
flourishing the flask in one hand and
the six-shooter in the other, while he
â¢ chided the boorishness of certain fellow
passengrers who declined to aid him in
consuming the spirits). When the car
arrived at its terminal. Fifth and Mar
. ket streets, he had absorbed all the
whisky, returned his firearm to con
cealment on his person and was snor
ing loudly in his seat. While in the act
of disembarking Mr. Townsen received
facial injuries, which impelled-^Patrol
men Cook and Draper to rush him to
the Receiving Hospital. When he
etepped from the car his feet became
: entangled and he pitched heavily for
ward, his nose and one of his jaws col
â¢ * liding so forcibly with the edge of a
â¢ pranite curb that when the officers
picked him up his features were not of
human semblance. As he was under
going medical treatment at the hos
pital the pistol -vas discovered In his
pocket, and that was how he came to
â¢ be arraigned before Police Judge Fritz
on the charges of drunkenness and car
rying a concealed weapon.
â¢ ' "This man." said an eloquent young
". advocate. Dointing to Mr. Jownsen's
blackened eyes and swollen jaw, "has
suffered severeÂ»|* for his intoxication,
and I move for dismissal of the other
charge on the ground that as a tray
Â« eler he Is exempt from prosecution un
-der the ordinance which prohibits the
carylng of concealed weapons."
The point was adjudged well taken,
and after the Judge had heard Mr.
Townsen's narrative of the causes that
led to his departure from his home, and
incidentally to his inebriety, dismissal
was ordered.

Peculiarly effective is the dramatist's
introduction of his heroine. \u25a0'\u0084 You hear
a voice singing as the curtain goes up
and then a black-browed person (Gen
eral Pablo) affirms to his sister (Trini
dad) that despite thÂ«i singing person's
attractions he is going to marry Mari
ana. Into the salon then come the va-*
rious people of the play, Mariana on
every tongue, her character, her mys
terious history. ,
You are equally curious with the
stage folk about her when she comes
in. Coquette, willful, heartless, charm
ing, as they say, she seems. To Dan
lelo she gives a lily from her breast,
and five teasing, . tender, charming
minutes, then to Don Pablo she gives
a rose and her hand on his arm from
the room. The first act's close shows
Danielo called away by the illness of
his father, j and Mariana going with
Pablo to the theater. \
â¢ In the next, act comes a marvelous
little revealing scene where Mariana
tells her guardian, who is remonstrat
ing with her for her treatment of
Danielo, of her childhood. Her father
was cold, cruel. Her mother, ah! One
night she dreamed that her doll kissed
her. She woke to find It was her
mother kissing her between sobs. A
man stood behind her, who kissed to
her: "love." "Not without- her." said
the mother, "and like a doll or a
lunatic, she dressed me and the ribbon
of my coat strangled me, and X was
eight years old. We went to London.
My mother cried In Madrid, she cried
far more in London. I never cried."
The mother died. The child was
brought back to Spain, her "father al
ways away," her governess "always
there." "And that" man that killed mv
mother/ 1 have seen him shed tears for
love of her. Danielo has not yet shed
tears for me, but he shall! he shall!"
The audience took its breathâ when
it stopped to take itâ in gasps here.
It took its breath pretty, much in
gasps throughout the rest of: the play.
When Danielo is discovered to be the
son of the man who took away Mari
ana's mother." and Mariana, loving
him, puts her hand into Pablo'sâ you
think here that it is impossible to keep
up the emotional pitch. \u25a0 It , goes \u25a0up
octaves in the last act No more pow
erfui situation than the . final one,
where Mariana is about to fly on her
wedding night with Danielo, can easily
be conceived. He ties her cloak about
her throat. It is tight, ; and in 'ithe
strangle of it . she remembers and sees
in her lover the son of the man that
killed her mother. She calls to her
husband, tells him that she loves Dan
ielo, that she Is going away with him.
"You promised to save me from - my
self," she shrieks. *Don Pablo stands
still. "Don't you -understand? I* am
going away with him." Her answer is
a shot. v
We may have taken* the Philippines
from Spain; she has still left her Eche

Kchcgaiay is neither the? Ibsen nor
the 'Suaermann of Spain, yet his work
seems to have been influenced 'by, both
dramatists. The Ibsen note is unmis
takable in the~"El Gran Ualeoto." It
is perhaps Ibsen by way of Sudermann
of whom one is so frequently, reminded
in the "Mariana." You get it, in, the

A NOTHER mistrial of Nan Patterson will no doubt /esiilt in
l\ her discharge. In neither of the trials -has the State made
out a case. /.People cannot be convicted of a capital crime
because it is thought they ought to be. It must be prpven to jus
tify conviction.
The case has been one of great notoriety and has inflicted
'certain injuries upon the country. Some sensational newspapers
have found it profitable to employ special writers to produce a lot
of sappy psychology and sentimental gangrene that would nauseate
any wholesome-minded person. This fine writing* is, unfortunately,
regarded in some quarters as literature, and must be in demand
or it: would not be supplied. When "the woman is set free she; will
drop out of sight and this pseudo psychology will go with* her, to the
great relief of the clean-minded public.
For another reason it. is to be hoped, that we have heard
the last of the case. The style of argument adopted by the official
prosecutor was discreditable to the legal profession, and the man
ners of the. leader for the. defense were not much better.. The final
arguments^to the jury, were no better than a bawling match, in
.^which the attorneys pulled out the worst parts of the .language to
;fiing.at each other. Of course there is much license necessarily per
mitted by the court, but this should not be used' to offend- good
taste and make decency blush. There will be other transgressions
of the moral law such as led to this tragedy that has been dragged
through three trials. But not many such transgressions are made
euch a wide spreading fester of evil as this has been by the sensa
tional newspapers. The curtain cannot fall too soon. /

It is impossible to overestimate the importance of such a re
form to China. It will enlarge and improve her trade and put her
in more sympathetic touch with the Western world. When this is
effected the last of the great silver nations will have put the white
metal in a secondary position, whither it has been tending by
natural selection since 1816, and gold, the actual measure, will be
the world's legal standard of value. s
Mexico lagged behind, but it was foreseen that her rising com
merce and the increased prosperity due to the securing of internal
peace by the wise policy of Diaz would finally compel her to make
her currency at home equal in value to that in which all the ex
changes of her foreign trade were made. Yet those in this country
who chose to consider that there was some heat left in the* ashes
of free silver contended that Mexico's large silver product would
restrain her statesmen and hold them steadfast to free coinage of
that metal. But that. Government has keenly appreciated the fact
that silver is only one product of Mexico, and that the country,
has many others which are rapidly increasing in volume and in
surplus for export, and that foreign trade is hampered and hindered
by the use of a debased and fluctuating standard. So, at last
Mexico pulls down Mr. Bryan's standard, ceases the free coinage of
silver and goes upon a gold basis.
This leaves China alone of the great nations on a silver basis.
Indeed, China has even worse than the silver standard, and the
beginning of financial reform there must be the abolition of that
standard on which depend all of the financial eccentricities of that
empire. In the treaty ports the currency is the Mexican dollar, the
Hongkong dollar, and the notes of native and foreign banks. In
some ports the silver sycee is currency, consisting of -lumps' of the
metal that pass by weight. Then there are the various taels.
There is no imperial tael, but cities and provinces have their own
tael. So there are the taels of Amoy, Canton, Chefu, Chinkiang,
Fuchau, Hankow, Haikwan, Hongkong, Nankin, Niuchwang,
Xingpo. Peking, Shanghai, Takao and Tientsin, all differing in
value. In like manner the copper "cash" used in small transactions
differs in value in each district.
The process of finding the value of a purchase in an interior
district and carrying it through the varying measures of taels, sycee
and Mexican dollars so as to get at the actual value at the point
of origin is intricate, vexatious and inimical to trade. The fifteen
different taels fluctuate with the price of the Mexican dollar, and
it fluctuates with the price of bullion, so that the whole monetary
system is set in a quiver by having silver for its basis. The Chinese
merchants realize the enormous inconvenience of this unstable
system, and it has been brought home to the Government by the
payment of the Boxer indemnities, so that the recent commercial
treaties made with the United States, Great Britain and Japan
agree that the financial system of China shall be reformed. . Since
then the empire has gone farther by expressing to the United States
in an official communication its desire to create a new monetary
system with national coinage 'with the value of coins fixed in gold
and resting on the gold basis. This proposition is to abolish taels
and sjxee and^copper cash, all of .varying value, and substitute
silver coins for large and nickel and copper for small transactions;
these coins to be a legal tender throughout the empire at their
nominal value. The gold basis for the whole is to follow as soon as
possible. s?
But our gold standard legislation put the United States legally,
as it had long been commercially, upon- the same financial foundation
as Europe, and the free silver agitation flickered up in 1900 and
then died out, and even its embers are scattered to the four winds.
Japan followed us closely by making the gold" yen her of
value. She is now reaping the benfits of that far-sighted policy of
Marquis Ito. Had she retained the silver standard her present
fight for life would have -been a hopeless struggle,' because of her
lack of exterior credit. Instead of this. she is able to place her war
loans in this country and Europe on most favorable terms, and
ranks financial!}', as in other respects, with the rest of the great
nations. Her commerce, which has gone on increasing during the
war, is conducted on equal terms with the rest of. the world and in
the same standard and measure of value.
IT is always evidence of the economic progress of a country when
it adopts the monetary standard of the commercial nations. In
1896 Mexico and Japan and China were the principal commer
cial nations on the silrcr standard. Europe was by law all on the
gold standard and the United States actually' used the same mone
tary measure, but was suffering from the purchase ;of silver bullion
and its coinage into dollars which endangered financial stability. *'
In the great educational campaign of that year Mr. Bryan con
tinually used Mexico and Japan to illustrate his free silver ideas.
Without them he would have had no concrete example or actual
experiment, arid would have been compelled to use theory and
prophecy alone. x He used these for all they were worth, and then
fell back upon the' example of Mexico and Japan. So great was
the impression he made that Governor Waite of Colorado proposed
a financial secession of the Western States from the United States
and their incorporation into the monetary system of Mexico. To
get an idea of the extent of the craze of that 'time one needs to re
call the number of Western newspapers which supported this se
cession idea and argued for it as if it were the sum of financial
Ayisdom.

For it was the custom of the good

sometimes into rather minute j particu

"Yes," said the other, "that's all

gain romance for themselves until late

Barrett Browning, of Tennyson, of
Hawthorne. They were 40 when they
married; yet their happiness was so
genuine " and 'so .beautiful that it was
a renewed artistic inspiration.
No one is old until the heart is
chilled. There are young old peopla
Just as there are old young people.

of roses is Indeed the time of love,
yet winter fires are bri;.- it, and when
we lack the sunshine from above c
tend more carefully love's sacred light.

to appreciate her gentle,- unpretentious
virtues.. And many a man who has
always listened to the voice of duty is
not in a position to marry until well

Former Governor James H. Budd,
attorney, and David Rich, agent of
the S. H. Frank* estate; would be de
lighted if the State \u25a0 Board \of Harbor
Commissioners would rectify the cen
ter line of East street from Sacra
mento" to Market,' 'so that ample
ground space could be provided for a
building; which the representatives of
the estate talk 'of ! constructing. on* the
westerly line of East street. The' sub
ject matter was presented \u25a0 to \ Hajrbor
Commissioners Charles :H.- Spear, John
D. Mackenzie and: Henry J.. Crocker
yesterday afternoon. ,/ -'-Mr.',
contended that the >L<eglslature of 1891
passed a. -law authorizing!. and direct-
Ing the Harbor Commissioners -to: rec
tify thecenter line of East street" from
Pacific to Market; so as to locate defi
nitely Uhe westerly line of that street.
In. the general discussion the fact
was elicited that the Legislature has
passed several laws relating to the
lines of East street, and there seems
to be nothing to prevent ; that body
from passing several \u25a0' more. It was
also noted in the discussion that the
State gave the tide "lands, to the city
and the city sold the lots, giving deeds
to all the purchasers of property
along the westerly line of East street.
It is presumed by the Harbor Com
missioners that the Frank estate got
all the land that it or its predecessors
paid for, and . nothing .was ' uttered in
the discussion to indicate a purpose
upon the part of the Harbor Board 'to
relinquish title to a single foot of land
reserved by the State" for a water front
thoroughfare. It is estimated that the
land which Budd and Rich want- for
building purposes is worth $100,000.-
The space is now used for car lines
and teams. The Harbor Commis
sioners are now paying-and have for
many years paid the entire expense of
keeping the thoroughfare In passable
condition. The city, and the property
owners on the westerly line pay noth
ing. Governor Budd incidentally re
marked, that as attorney of the board,
he put in the "bug" which gave the
Harbor Commission jurisdiction of the
whole thoroughfare. â¢< \u25a0
President Spear remarked that the
"bug" placed on the board the expense
of keeping the street in repair. ;'' \
Commissioner Henry J. Crocker
asked many questions touching the
original reservation and the subse
quent sale of lots. Maps at hand were
studied. Chief Engineer Norton holds
to the opinion that some of the land
was not sold.' Commissioner. Crocker
desired to know if the individual
property owners on East street from
Pacific to Market, got all the land they
paid for when the lots were 'sold.'
Attorney Budd " remarked to the
Commissioners that ' the â¢ Supreme
Court had decided that there was no
East street between Market and Mis
sion streets. The "significance*; of ' this
remark was not quite obvious.
- The board consented that the Chief
Engineer should make a Â» large map
showing the lines of East street; It
.was directed that William } H. Davis,
attorney of the 'commission, should
interpret the law for . the engineer,
should knowledge of the law become
essential in the map making.
David Rich explained to the board
that the representatives of the. Frank
estate were considering plans for the
Investment of a large sum of , money
in a building facing East"* street be
tween Clay, and Market. A clash- with
the Harbor Commission was not j de
sired, yet he apprehended that a. clash
would follow if the building operations
were begun before the line of the
street was rectified.
It is clearly foreshadowed that, the
State will have, a battle in the courts
to protect the East street reservation
In its entirety. Attorney Budd in re
ply to inquiries remarked that he _ was
in the case on a contingent fee. There
are indications that "William H. Davis,
attorney of . the / Harbor Commission,
will have - ample opportunity to 1 grain
distinction as a defender of publio
rights. ;
; Attroneys LJoyd and Heggerty have
. won 1 their " fight ; against .',â¢ Attorney Jo
sepb^S.'Tobin; legal representative of
Mrs* Oelrlchs tand Mrs. Vanderbilt. % by
pfevailihg; upon Judge, Cook to strike
out :of /.the ;: order? made', on - Tuesday.'
April 25, in the estate of the late
Charles L,.', Fair the words; "or to be
rendered,"^ referring. to their services.
\u25a0 When the case ; was called yesterday
afternoon "Attorney Heggerty made a
motion to , strike â¢:- out r of . : the affidavit
submitted last Tuesday by Tobin'any
reference *to the â¢ notice given him and i
Attorney Llyod regarding. the contem- i
plated application for the order and to j
the .alleged, agreement between them
and the distributees of the estate in re- !
gard. to their allowance of $150,000. He
argued' that the alleged agreement was
not : relevant \to the present issue and
was ? based upon i hearsay. There was
nothing before the court to Justify the
insertion of .the words "or" to be ren
dered. in the order. He asked that the
order to show causa be granted.
Tobin argued at length that the al
lowance ?of J150, 000 "was for all past,
present and future services. There was
a contract, he ' contended, and he read
a.. telegram from~ Mrs. i "Vanderbilt to
George A. j Knight : : and . Knight's reply
to bear out his assertion. As their fees
had been paid' the distributees were en
titled' to' have: the property relieved
from the lien.
- I Judge Cook asked Tobin If he claimed
that the * decree of distribution made
the counsel fees a lien on the entire.es
tate, and. Tobin ' replied In the affirma
tive.'/ r:;.:. .:- . - -\- - : ;.; ?.'.. . \u25a0"'-., '. \u25a0
. Lloyd showed from . documents that
everything had : been accomplished In
accordance with the decree of 1 distribu
tion and there was no Hen on the estate
for counsel fees.'; He denied that there
was any agreement, ; as contended by
Tobin, saying It would be an absurdity
for an attorney, to bind himself for any
future services. : No attorney, he said,
would sully,' himself by attempting to
answer the allegations in the; affidavit.
The Judge granted Heggerty's mo
tion ;to strike out, ' and said that when
the order was asked on April 25 he was
busy. In :a ; murder trial and * had not
read the order carefully. Under, the de
cree there was no Hen for future attor
ney fees, but only, for \ the .amount
then due, and when that was paid the
Hen ceased. 'It' any . other claim was
made it ; would be time enough to bring
up the "alleged 'agreement. He could i
not , see how he could adjudicate upon
something that might never arise. He
then, ordered that the order. of April 25
be amended by striking out the words
"or. to be rendered,"" to which Tobin
excepted. : ';".'..'\u25a0>\u25a0-:'-'\u25a0:' '-" .
City Chemist Gibbs ; ; filed '> report

! the analyses of samples 'of the Fcatsup;
catsups 5 disclosed . the '\u25a0, presehco* of . pre
servatives or coloring , matter, * or 'â¢[ both
, ingredients. 1 Gibbs states in, his .report
that twenty of - the samples', contained
coal tar, dye, -sixteen .benzole acid;
four salicylic acid" and three saccha
; fine. Only six of the samples did not
i contain a coloring , substance, five of
? them v having benzole acld ! and "one
; saccharine. ' ; ;, \u0084 , \u0084 \u25a0 ."
â¢ Gibbs also submitted two pieces of
! cloth . originally white in color,- but one
iof which â¢ was dyed ja : brilliant ( red I and
Â§ the other a salmon red^ by,' being t im-*
j mersed in , two of; the samples -of (cat

I consumed by; children " whose
systems are unable "to ' resist i tjie " de

l tent of. between .04 and .06 milograms

(. the presence of arsenio, could. â¢- result
j from; old bottles : being - cleaned with
â¢ lead shot, some of which might "be left
I in the bottle and be acted.uponby.the
j catsup to form poison.; Gibbs; advised
j that the use of lead shot to clean bot-
I ties be prohibited. .
j So important were the disclosures

held a special meeting and adopted the

Van Vliet Trophy for Miss Mearns.
The handicap singles tennis tour
nament for the Van Vliet cup was won
yesterday by Miss Ida Mearns. In the

resulted. N v
, Miss Cully received odds\f 3-6. and
won one set out of three. The second

many others in this tournament. The
score was 6âl.6 â 1. 12 â 14, 6âl.6 â 1. Miss
Cully essayed the net position, but
Miss Mearns did some .scientific lob
*bing, which won the match. for her.*
,The semi-final match: between Miss
CuHy and Miss Vera Crocker was the
best of. the. day.... Miss. Crocker. "owed
1-6." while Miss Culley received odds
of 3-6. The scratch player won- the
first set' so .easily -that, victory looked
assured for her. Miss Cully* played
much better in the next two sets, both
of- which she ' won. The score was
Iâ6. 7â5. 6^â3.
Two. sets of.the other semi-final
march were played on Wednesday. The
third and- deciding set was won easily
kby Miss Mearns. Mrs. Watson, the

Hylnnd-Snnilham Fight Postponed.
SACRAMENTO, May .4.â Attorney
Chaunc'ey H. Dunn to-night filed ob
jection with" Mayor' Hassett and Chief
of Police Coffey against the pulling: off
of the Hyland-Snailham prize-fight,
which was arranged by the . Hoffman
Athletic Club for to-morrow night.
Mr. Dunn gave warning that: all par
ticipants * would â¢be prosecuted for
felony under section 412. of the Penal
Code, as amended in 1903/ which
makes it a State Â» prison . offense
to i conduct a boxing contest ex
cept under provisions of an ordinance
to be adopted by the City Trustees in
a city .like Sacramento, or by the Su
pervisors in a city like San ' Francisco.
It is set ' forth by Mr. \u25a0 Dunn that no
such ordinance "has been enacted in
Sacramento, and/ that, therefore it
would be a felony to bring off " the
match. The fight will be postponed.'. .
The most notable athletic meet held

The match was for the best two
out of three falls, and both men have
been in training for weeks. Jenkins
is the champion catch-as-catch-can
wrestler of America, and Hacken
schmidt is known as' the "unbeaten
Graeco-Roman champion."
NEW YORK, May -4. â George
Hackenschrnidt, known as "the Rus
sian lion," won from Tom. Jenkins of
Cleveland to-night in their wrestling
match for the world's catch-as-catch
can championship at Madison-square
Garden in two straight falls. In the
first bout the Russian took the aggres
sive* from the start, and threw Jenkins
with a half- Nelson after thirty-one
minutes and fifteen seconds of hard
wrestling. The second and last bout
was somewhat shortfer, for Jenkins
had weakened , and Hackenschrnidt
won in twenty-two minutes four sec
onds with a half-Nelson and body
hold. â¢-:v:- i :.,:;K^..:

ST. LOUIS, May 5. â Fire which was
discovered shortly before midnight de
stroyed twenty-five .stables at the St.
Louis Fair Association race track and
resulted in the death of twelve or
more horses." The principal loser is
Frank Gering of St. Louis, .whose en
tire string, with the exception of Flo
ral Wreath, was destros'ed.
After many ups and downs Jimmy
Britt and Jal>ez White arc to meet to
night in Woodward's Pavilion in a
twenty-round bout before the Hayes
Valley Club..
The Gmnd Jury is to meet this after
noon to discuss the light, on whicli I
Foreman Andrews will make a report.
The foreman said last night he was
personally in favor of the fight being
heJd. Ail he wants is that the sport !
be promoted in a clean manner and |
thai the public be piouotcd from
sharpers.
The jurors will give 'no hint- as to the j
grounas oil which they couid stop the I
nght. It is known they have been told '
how the public has been imposed upon j
/in the past and it is on these lines they \
are supposed to be proceeding.
Manager Morris Levy has complied
with ail the regulations in the ordi
nance governing boxing and knows of
no method under the law by which the
tight can be stopped. He has had aTI
his prools ready UÂ» present io' the Dis
tric Attorney, showing his compliance
uiiii the law in every particular.
It is not expet'teu the Grand Jury
will interftrc- with the fight. .The po
lice wili be instructed not to permit the
overcrowding of the gallery or of any
part of the house.
; Britt has ruled a strong 4 to 10 choice
jn what little betting has been 1 done.
There is no open wagering owing to
hte attitude of the police officials. What
money is placed is chieny between
friends.
The men are to weigh in**at Harry
Corbett's this af ternoorf at 2 o'clock at
J33 pounds. Both arc expected to come
in handily at t^his weight as it is a
natural mark for them to make. They
vill both gain before they enter the
ring, and it is possible they will scale
nearly 135 pounds, as neither is of the
worrying kind.
White's long siege of training is over,
and the Briton is anxiously waiting
for the tap of the gonp. Yesterday was
the Quietest day spent by White since
his sojourn at Larkspur. He rose early
and took- a short walk, accompanied
by Charlie Mitchell.
The only work indulged in . during
the afternoon was a few minutes' ex
ercise with the dumb bells. The sxeat
er part of the day was spent in loung
ing around the camp and In packing
up. White said: "I certainly expect
to win, but cannot say whether by a
knockout or on points. I came all the
. .way from England to fight'Britt. and
1 hope to score a decisive victory over
him. I have trained hard and faith
lully for the battle, and I am fn the
best possible condition. In fact, I
never felt better in my life.. If I lose
I will offer r.o excuses."
Battling Nelson is out with a lone
and peppery statement. In which he
accuses Britt of trying to make capital
by saying he is willing to meet the
Dane: Nelson announces he has delayed
his departure for the East to make
this match, and that he will post $2500
to-day for a fight with Britt. He says
he has been assured the match can be
decided here in June.
Dan Smith and C. D. Fell of Youngs
town, Ohio, are here for the fieht.

even .the most - hardened racegoer the
struggle between these two was such as
to send a lump into the throat. There

Added to the interest , dis
played, in the new track came. the un
expected result in the Metropolitan
Handicap, which V has never before in
its history^, extending back to 1891,
been marked s by a : dead heat. The en
thusiasm of the great crowd was un-*
bounded", as the two highly 'trained
thoroughbreds came pounding down the
long stretch, nod for - nod. The scene
was thrilling. . Beldame, the champion
filly of last year, "was forgo-tteri and. in
the ruck at.t he finish. Half a score of
other; thoroughbreds \ were not thought

-An even dozen thoroughbreds went to

scratching of^ Delhi made Sysonby ; the
favorite ?'at odds Jof J2 to ,1. Beldame
was | heavily played Vat v ' 4 to 1. ' These
two carried the bulk' of r the wagers. '
"*"After a tiresome delay at the post
the horses were sent away. Santa' Cata

â¢ The baseball fans, who paraded to the
Eighth-street lot yesterday afternoon
were a lons time finding out whether .",
the Commuters were trying to kid |
them. It seemed they were, especially :
in the third inning, but the wise onts
finally jerried and at last came to the'
conclusion that Oakland was, not hand
ing out any joke,' but doing the best
it could, which was bad. Score â l.os
Angeles 10, Oakland 1:
At any rate it was funny. 'Every
one agreed it was the greatest q;amÂ«; of j
its kind ever pulled off in this vii.'^s:^
or any other seaport town of equal
size. No one could deny it : was worth ,
the 35 to see Graham, Streib, 'Kelly
and the other, stars boot that ball
around the lot. After the. third round
it was curtains, but the, fun continued
and the spectators seemed to snjoy
themselves. ,
The Angels brought four runs over
in the third-and they did not. need a
single hit to help them out either.
Bt-ots and fumbles and , other ' bad
things which frequently happen in ball
games sent the runners through. Every
Commuter seemed to be .balancing on
his ear and did not know whether the
score was 100 to 1 or 1 to 0.
Graham was taken out of the box
after that frinhtful spasm and' young
Mr. Hogan made his -first bow to the
Eighth-street fans. He pitched good
ball, but the team, was so shaky and
fidgety and so high up, in .; the heavenly
regions that | the busher did not have
a chance to shine as brightly as he
might have done under, different cir
cumstances.
The Angels pulled off all kinds 7 cf
plays when they had; the Commuters
where they wanted them. Ross made
a clean . steal . of the plate in the sev
enth, after going through a double steal
with Toman. Van Haltren came in to
protest the decision and/ Bull Perine
immediately banished the old man to
the bench for the balance of the game.

| The freight steamer Meteor collided
with the ; four-masted schooner A. B.
Johnson late yesterday afternoon off
Folsom street, and but for her cargo of
lumber the sailing' vessel- would have
filled and "sunk within a few minute*.
The Meteor's sharp iron" bow poked a
deep dent in the .schooner's starboard
quarter and then ripped away a wide
stretch of planking. The Spreckels tug
Relief, went to- the schooner's assist
ance and towed her ' to Beale street
wharf, where she tied up. for the night.
Captain. Golightly of the Meteor as
sumes responsibility for the * accident,
/declares that , It was -beyond his
power to prevent' it."
The A. B. Johnson, Captain. A. C.
Siegelhorst in command, had just ar
rived from' Grays Harbor, after a run of
five days. She had -590.000 feet of lum
ber on i boar'di She came up the bay.
with all , her /.canvas , set and drawing
and was" sailing well out from the ends
of the wharves. The ' Meteor. Captain
Golightly; is ' under charter to the Pa
cific Coast Steamship Company. . She
had been - discharging coal at Beale
street. Empty and standing high out
of the water, she was on her; way to
load cargo at Broadway wharf. Off
Folsom street she encountered the A.
B. Johnson.; '
"There' was plenty^ of" room . for the
Meteor to have avoided the schooner,"
said Captain Golightly, "and nothing
was further from my. mind than a col
lision, - when | a .northwest squall struck
the. Meteor's high bow and she refused
to answer her. helmâ going the other
way, In fact. "When I saw that a colli
sion was unavoidable I gave the order
for full speed astern, and I . think we
were nearly , stopped when the vessels
came together.' The schooner had good
headway, ' however, and we hit with
considerable force. The schooner, had
a right to keep on its course, as it did,
but I think the; collision could* have
been avoided if the captain "of the
schooner had put up his helrri. The
schooner has the law on her side, how
ever, and the responsibility for the col
lision rests .with me." . .',!"..;
Captain Golightly has the reputation
of: being, a careful navigator. When
the steamer Oregon took . fire at sea a
little while. ago it was the Meteor, with
Captain Golightly in command, that
took off the Oregon's passengers and
then. stood by the burning vessel until
all danger was past.
This is the\ first accident that has be
fallen Captain Siegelhorst of. the A. B.
Johnson during forty years of com
mand. The A. B.J ohnson isa vessel
of 460 tons register. She was | built-in
1900 at Aberdeen and is owned by Wil

Sarcasm loses nothing by awaitisc
the psychological moment for its utter
ance. Also it oftentimes' is most
fraught with the sharpness of a two
edged sword when It Is contained In a
stmple statement of fact. A husband
given to periodical locks upon the
cocktail when it contains a cherry,, his
glance at such times dwelling thereon
for two or three successive days with
out ' interruption, arose one . morning:
recently with a head out of all propor
tion to his hat measure and a throat
that felt like a limekiln. No explana
tion was needed when he told his wtfe
he was going out for a moment to get
rid of the olive green taste in - > his
mouth: he would be back right away.
AH she said was. "Bring a steak home)
with you -for breakfast." He went, to a
cocktail dispensary and got his brace.
As he was going out he met a' friend
who told him he would ;; f eel better if. he
had - another. . He did feel better, so
much better that he was" prevailed oa
to -â¢ further * improve-^the \u25a0 state of his
physical arid ; mental well being by a
third diving after a cherry. He did not
see his home for two days. Again, onÂ©
morning he awoke , witn tron . '. bands

Not a single new peerage has been
created by Edward VII duringVthe â¢
twelve months that have come to j
a close, and for this reason, if for no '
other, ."the year 1904 will remain'one of J
note. In order to appreciate the inno- !
vation which it marks, it should be ex
plained that nearly two- thirds of the
peerages represented in the House of
Lords were created during the reign of
Queen Victoria,* not always by her own
wish, but often at ; the urgent entreaty
of her Premiers, who . desired in â¢ this
way, to secure rewards \u25a0 for the services
of commoners to the political 1 parties
of which they were the chiefs.
" King Edward, it is said, disapproves
of this practice, and :it is reported that
he is t resolved that henceforth elevation
to the* House of Lords shall constitute
the recognition of, services to the na- j
tion as a whole, rather than to a mere
political' faction: that a peerage shall (
be regarded, not a ministerial gift, but l
p '- sovereign appreciation or merit ; and
pre-eminence in one or. another branch '
of public life, and that far fewer peer- {
ages 'shall be brought into '/existence '
than -heretofore. * Several" have become '>
extinct in 1904, including the Dukedom j
of Cambridge and the Earldom of Ra
vensworth. No" new ones- have been 1
created, a fact which has given rise to
much ; comment.â New York ' Tribune. \

No conclusion has been arrived at as
to the name which should be given
Arizona and New Mexico when they
are admitted into the as one
State. There is a general agreement,
however, that the name should not be
New Mexico. There are .three States
which have the prefix "New" and they
are enough. Furthermore, New Mex
ico was an inapt -designation for the
Territory and would be equally so for
a 'State.- '."" ; ... ' / '\u25a0Â» â¢-\u25a0\u25a0-.â¢ \u25a0
A year or two ago "Montezuma" was
suggested, ' but It did not take. He
never was \ identified .with either New
Mexico or Arizona. The lands he ruled
over lay far to the south. A more ap
propriate designation would be "Cl
bola." the name given by the first -
Spanish explorers to the group of Zunl
villages In western New Mexico.
' The proposition that the State be
baptized "Irrigante," â¢ "Irrigate," or
"Irriga" should be rejected scornfully.
If the name must have some connec
tion with water, which is what the two
Territories , greatly lack, then that of
Rio Grande might be chosen with pro
priety. ' There are a number of river
States â Mississippi. Missouri. Connecti
cut, Ohio, Tennessee, etcâ and ona
more would not come amiss.
But why not "Arizona?" That is me
lodious and dignified. Its. selection will
pour a little-balm Into the wounds of
the Arizonans, who are resisting con
solidation on the ground that it will
give the New Mexicans everything and
them nothing. They may at least bo
given the consolation prize of a name.
Then the New Mexicans will all be
Arizonans. I
With so good a name as Arizona
available one must be surprised at thÂ»
perverse ingenuity of men who suggest
"Irrigate" or such barbaric com
pounds *as ' "Mexona" or "Mexari."-^

Snowbound Harlemltes struggling
homeward through the storm between
5 and 6 o'clock yesterday afternoon
saw a strange sight at the corner of
eighth avenue and One Hundred and
Twenty-fifth street. It was that of a
pretty young woman, stylishly attired,
with a bundle of evening papers under
her arm, which she was selling. At her
side waa a small boy wnose cheeks
showed signs of several muddy rivu
lets of tears. His eyes were discolored
from crying.
'That particular corner of Harlem Is
thronged by a. dozen rival "newsies."
Competition is keen, and conflicts,
which are generally settled by < force,
are of frequent occurrence. The small
newsboy had Incurred - the wrath of a
biggerboy. his papers had been thrown
in the snow and he had received sev
eral cuffs in the bargain.
The young woman who had seen the
affair helped him gather His papers up.
"Never mind, Tommy,** she said, when
the last paper had been secured. - "I'll
sell your papers for you."
A small crowd,,, unmindful of * r the
storm, gathered about and. watched
her \u25a0 curiously. The stocÃ of papers,
about two, dozen, dwindled rapidly, and
every one sold brought five cents.
. When the Last paper had been sold
she' turned to the shlveAng boy at her
side. "Hold your hands," she said. He
obeyed, and she poured the handful of
nickels and dimes into them. Later it
was learned that she was Miss Mar
garet Mexriman, who lives at the Three
Arts Cltib at No. 803 Lexington ave

; Now, the Birth .'of Prince of Piedmont
Gives 'Another Disappoint-;
\ * ;'ment.
. The Duchess D'Aosta, whose alarm
ing. illness caused the abrupt termina
tion of the Queen of Portugal's visit
to England, was surely born under
some unlucky star. A -daughter -of
; the," gods, divinely tall. . she was far
and away the most beautiful princess
in Europe and at one time stood a
! good chance of being the future Queen
; of England, where she was born- and
brought up.
Every one has heard the romantic
story of how the late Duke of Clarence
fell in love with'the lovely French girl
at first ' sight and * how the resources
of diplomacy were, exhausted in the
' vain attempt to get around the vexed
j question of a difference of religion. v
.A. long correspondence between
Queen Victoria and Pope Leo XIH on
; the subject may be found, among the
state papers at Windsor, while, to
leave no stone unturned, the young:
Princess went herself to Rome to try
the effect of personal persuasion at
the Vatican. .
For four months she remained thÂ«
guest of General .de Charetie, whose
mother was half sister of the Comta
de,.Chambord and who commanded
the papal troops in the war with Vic
tor Emmanuel.. His wife., a brilliant
American (born Folk), was one of
the acknowledged leaders of society in
papal circles.
These negotiations, however, proved
unavailing; an adverse decision waa
inevitable and the Princess HelenÂ©
submitted like a dutiful daughter of
the church. But her * English lover
was never the same again and when
he died, a few years afterward. thÂ»
last word on his lips was her name.
Her subsequent union with the DukÂ»
d'Aosta was arranged with a -view to
placing her on another throne â thÂ»
possible marriage of the present Kins
of Italy, then Prince "of Naples, being:
considered out of the question. :
. The ultramontane party set all it*
hopes on the alliance, believing it* saw
in it a promise of the restoration of
the patrimony of the church, and thÂ»
cheers which greeted the beautiful
bride when she appeared on the bal
cony of the Qulrlnal were not all of
loyalty to the house of Savoy.
But once again the brilliant pro**
pects cf the Princess were doomed to>
disappointment. -The unexpected oc
curred and the recent- birth of th*
Prince of Piedmont extinguished thÂ«
last hopes of the house of A osta. Per
sonally the Duchess has never been
popular. in the country of her adop
tion. Her cold English manner is not
liked by the Italians and her relations
with her royal relatives are rather
strained. The unsophisticated daugh
ter of a mountain chieftain is consid
ered no equal by a princess who
proudly signs herself "Helene de
France," and her sarcastic reference
to Queen Helena as "my cousin, the
shepherdess,'* has never been forgot
ten or- forgiven.â Chicago Chronicle.
To-day circumstances .place a comÂ»
mander completely out -of sight of his
army. > He is ' usually ? located at least
ten or fifteen miles from the firing line
and iri many: insUnces is even farther
away. He sits ": in a room, where i ra
diate telephone and telegraph lines to
the remotest portion of the field, plac
ing him " in instantaneous 1 communica
tion with his principal subordinates.
': The 1 famous painting? of Napoleon at
Austerlitz represents to the popular
eye a commanding general directing
a great battle. But it belongs to the
warfare of the past. The artist who
aspires \ to. depict the direction of a
modern ,"" battle must show a . man
seated at a table on which is spread
*a huge map dotted with little flags in
dicating the location of the opposing
forces, v:Xh an ordinary desk tele^
phone*! his elbow. In an adjoining
room is a switchboard, where sit alert
operators ready to connect the com
mander with- any of the field head
qilarters. From' this room also comes
'the steady" clicking of a score of tele
graph instruments, busily receiving
and sending messages.
But for the military uniforms of
the messengers and the -going and
coming of staff officers, the man at the
table might be a stock operator di
recting, . through his brokers, a deal
in steel or railroad securities. Even
the stenographer at his elbow. is not
lacking, but sits quietly taking mes
sages: under dictation, .to>>. be trans-
I mitted presently by telegraph.. Other
! officers . copy the- messages and file
them away, after putting them un
der a time-recording stamp, to show
the hour they were sent, so that after
ward delinquencies may be- located
and responsibilities fixed. .
Thus, . apart from the excitement
and" horrors "of the battlefield, a gen
eral, sits at his desk and. calmly . di
rects the battle. He he,ars that this
attack- has been repulsed and -that
reinforcements .are needed here, that
ammunition is running low there, that
the division has been cut to pieces,
that those troops have been two days
without food, and so on, along his
forty miles of front, and takes his
measures accordingly. This picture
is not fanciful. With due allowance
for the fa liability of all human de
vices when subjected to the strain of
abnormal conditions, it Is substantial
ly correct. â Washington Star.

Iron and steel trade reports disclose
the fact that the rate of production In that
trade is at length overtaking the steel ex
panding consumption, and price conditions as
â¢ consequence are not as firm. Railroad traffic
officials admit a falling off from the high level'
of the March activity, and the rate of expan
sion after railroad earnings is- therefore not so
rapid. The Northwestern railroad situation
*=*-*ms to be still the most important factor in
the stock market, as It has been ever since
the flfteen-point break in Northern Securities
ftock on the day th? Supreme Court issued Its
mandate for tne dissolution of the company,
which was the date of the beginning of the
present decline In stocks. The dread Increases
that the Northern Pacific Is to be a bone of
contention again, and that a failure to com
trorni6e on its control will precipitate hostil
ities and reprisals. It was evident that epeclal
anxiety was felt regarding to-morrow's meet
ing of ctockhclders of the Union Pacific to
authorise the proposed $100,000,000 preferred
stock issue. Â«nd m&ny rumors circulated of
the danger of a contest developing in that
company aÂ» an outgrowth of the dispute ovor
Northern Pacific. The disclosure In the Lake
Fhore annual report that a part of that eom
â¢patty's holding of Reading stock had been dis
poeed of in the market gave a chill to the
opinion that community of Interest of this
character waÂ« being constantly exttmled
among railroads generally. The news from
the Chicago strike had some, adverse senti
mental Influence on the market. It will be ob
eerved. however, that the largwt selling and
the heavl*TÂ»t decline werÂ« among stocks that
would t* Involved In a conflict growing out of
the quection of Northern Pacine control and
the railroad policies concerned in It. Losses
tn these stocks and In a number of others
Including a considerable list of Industrial*,
ran to three points or upward, while losses
UP to thst figure were quite general through
out th* list. . A late recovery of 1 to 2 points
was entirely lort In the last fifteen minutes
mhen price* generally dropped to the low level
cf the rfay and closed only slightly above
with a weak undertone.' '

NEW YOKK, May 4.â Liquidation was re
newed on a very large scale in io-day's stock
market, and a very feeble demand presented
itself to absorb the large offerings. So much
was obvious from the volume of the dealings
and th*- movement of prices. As to the sources
of this liquidation and the motive for it, the
indications were nut so clear, and the elements
of mystery were made the most of in the active
conjectures of stock market operators, accord
ing to the habit of that claas. ' It was a fair
inference that the liquidation wti of a concen
trated character and represented the closing
out of some large and important accounts held
by a. few individuals, presumably also of
I'ower and resources in thÂ« financial world.
The fact of liquidation of this character tak
ing place was of decisive effect on sentiment.
It was eupposed that very large holdings,
which had been withheld rroxn the market
during the demoralization of Saturday /and
Monday were now being pressed for sale, to
take advantage of the revived strength of
rrices. This very evident liquidation disap
pointed the hope that the most Important sell
ing had been completed and that the worst to
be looked for Â«\u25a0*Â» a dull ana aiugffith market.
ConSoesce in the general situation Is still pro*
fesfeed in a large degree, but the renewed
weakness in stocks to-day caused some ques
tion of possible developments in the general
equation still to be revealed to the general
public.

The liuumber Trade. '
Pacific Coast Wood and Iron for May says:
"Both redwood lumber and ehineies are la
heavy demand with prices firm and prospects
excellent. The mills are having; hard work
to keep up with their orders and every one,
.from the manutacturer to the consumer, seems
to feel satisfied.
â¢"I2je markets of the Pacific Northwest are
in a most unsatisfactory condition owing to
weak demand and unstable prices. This is
True 'as regards pine and spruce lumber and
f-pder shingles.
"The sugar and California white pine mar- :
ket is firm and. business is rushing. Some
of the mills have even more, than they can ,
handle in the line of orders and are slough
ing over Into other companies those orders
that they cannot handle. Prices are strong
and the mills Just opening operations, have
nearly all oT them Increased their capacities.
*o that the present season will probably '
be even more profitable than those of the
past ..en years and that is caylng much.
"The retail trade is active in and around
the San Francisco territory- Buildings arÂ«
iroing up like the traditional mushrooms
and all species of lumber are going Into
them. The same condition is true of all the
California localities and . the best of years
*<-ems to be ahead of the lumber dealers of
thÂ« Golden State.
â¢'A dleoatch from Tacoma says that four
hundred shingle manufacturers of the Sound
country * r * unhappy over the demoralize
condition of the shingle market. In spite
of the bitter ptrt experiences the sbingU
men cannot stand together lorg enough to.
secure a shutdown of the mills during mid
summer smd midwinter, thereby stopping the
over-i>rcKluctlon. â¢
"In the Eastern msrkets there is a stiff de
mand for shinties only in the spring and
Tall. ThÂ« operation of shingle mills eight
months in a year wou^ furnish ar. amp'e
supply for both local and Eastern markets.
Odar stumpare near tidewater is becoming
fÂ»caxÂ«\ with the result that tfce logs are
constantly increasing in price. The mills
on tidewater cannct operate with prcflt with
the present prices of logs and shingles. The
situation shoÂ»* no sign of Improvement. The
last three months have been more disappoint
ing than any previous period."

"The Wool trade of thÂ« coast is in a flour

per cent "higher., than last year,- and with the
London sales, which began this :.wÂ«ek ' and
showed a' 5 to, lo - per cent advance in fine
grades and' lo t0. 15 per. cent in mediums. It is
almost a certainty that the domestic clip of

$200 'from * Smith for five months.- She
also admitted rather, reluctantly that
Smith gave her. $250 wiienshe left him
at San Francisco "for Hot Springs and
$200 more, which he. wired to hei\.there

Chief Desmond worked for hours in

Smith's nefarious - transactions . . and
tried also through " her to " locate : and
trace a 'portion of $34,000 which Smith
alleges he applied, to the; January en

"Gateways to the Smart Set" is the
subject of an Illustrated article in this
week's Town Talk. The Saunterer arti
cles on affairs in social and business cir
cles are very interesting. This is the
breeziest Town Talk that has been issued
in months and four extra pases have
been added to carry all the news and
sprightly comment. It contains another
poem from the pen of Louis Robertson
and other original verse and fiction. The
odore Bonnet has written of the Sothern-
Marlowe production. Among the amus
ing features are quotations from current
short stories of the Pottles, showing that
they are explaining: their own domestic
troubles In fiction. It apears that If you
don't read Town Talk you don't know
what Is groins on in the world and that
you miss much genuine literature.
LIGHTING BPECIFICATIONS.â The Su

Something to Hold Yon.
City Treasurer McDougald yester
day reduced Chief Deputy Devoto to
a. clerkship at the latter's request and
immediately appointed Charles B. Per
kins, who has been receiving teller
in the office for seven years past, to
the position vacated. While McDou
gald places the utmost confidence in
Devoto, he came to the conclusion that
the latter's unfortunate mistake in
cashing defaulting Tax Collector
Smith's worthless check for $15,590 08
merited some action on bis part. De
\oio \\<lh inclined to the same belief
and the change of positions was at
once put into effect- The other em
ployes in the office will . remain as at
present.
The following communication was
filed by Devoto with- McDougald, -ac
quainting the latter with his desires
In the premises:
Hon John E. McDousald, Treasurer â Dear
Cir: I revpÂ«etfa]ly submit the following:: The
expert for th* Grand 3iiry reports that every
dollar that should be in the vaults Is there,
lese the ' amount represented by a. check for
1 15,690 OS. \u25a0' \u25a0 \u25a0- \ \u25a0 '
During the time that I have been employed
la your Â«ffice. 1 handled about $45,000,000, and
notwithstanding the Grand Jury came upon me
unexpectedly and taking control of my cash
so that if any shortage was there I .would
aot be x>ermltted to make it rood, ' they found
that my cash was 68 cents to the rood.
You reposed a great confidence In mÂ». and
it is gratifying to know that I did not abute
It to my own personal ends. My great error
haa tried your friendship beyond any hope of
Â«. continuance, bo I request you to now make
eueh disposition of me as will best serve the
Interests of all concerned. If \u25a0â¢ you decide to
retain me In your office until the end of this
Inquiry. I would be pleased to have you
transfer me to other work and assign the cash
to other persons. Respectfully youre,
LOUIS A. DEVOTO.
Charles B. Perkins, the new Chief
Deputy Treasurer, is a man of known
Integrity In the community. He was
first appointed receiving teller by
Treasurer L J. Truman in January,
1899. When Samuel H. Brooks was
elected Treasurer on the Democratic
ticket in 1900 he invited Perkins to
retain the place of receiving teller,
although the latter is a Republican.
Perkins has . resided in this city for
thirty years and previous to entering
poltlcs was successfully engaged in the
retail furnishing goods business for
twenty years. He is a director in the
Toung Men's Christian Association
and Is also president of the local com
mission handling the publishing inter
ests of the Methodist Episcopal
church.
The stealings of Edward J. Smith
may.- be "found much more extensive
I. than at 'first supposed. The papers and
j check-books found in the private desk
1 of [the defaulting Tax Collector^ show
I that ;he" had been systematically rob
bing the city, for over a year.
The first approximate estimate made
byDouglas Young, the Grand July ex
pert, placed .the, amount .at \u25a0 about; $72,
000. NowV it is feared that, the .total
will be far in excess of $100,000. The J
system of thefts was so Intricate that J
it; will take .days and perhaps.: weeks!
to find out{ how, much * the embezzlinc j
official stole in' the tax office. Expert
Young will work day and night on this {
-phase of the ; scandal. j
"Why, from ; what we- found by raj
hasty perusal 'yesterday," r said \u25a0*. Fore- ;
man Andrews, '.'we - could i return \
enough:, indictments against Smith to (
send-him to jail for life.. It cannot be I
