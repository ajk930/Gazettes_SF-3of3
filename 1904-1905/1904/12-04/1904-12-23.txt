Nelson's suspicions -were aroused
he dropped into Corbett's saloon
and found a letter left there by his
manager. This letter announced that
Murphy had left town on account of
sudden illness and it told Nelson not
to worry, as he would hear from bis
manager la a Jew days, adding that
Nelsons money, which Murphy had.
would be all right. .With the letter
were inclosed a hundred dollar bill and
a ticket to carry Nelson to Chicago.
As soon as Nelson read the note he
became suspicious and notified Captain
Burnett of the detective bureau regard
ing the sudden disappearance of his
manager. He said that his sparring
partr.er, Eddy Santry, was to leave for
Chicago last night on the Santa Fe
overland, which left Point Richmond at
S:55. and that he believed Murphy was
on the same train. Captain Burnett at
once wired the stations along the line
where the train would stop to arrest
Murphy if he was on the train.
Nelson said that Murphy had the
fighters share of the purse from the
recent Cght and he was also taking
care of money which Nelson won on
other fights in this city.
Murphy has been Nelson's manager
since he began fighting three years
ago. Nelson made but little money as
a boxer ur.til he cair.e here several
months ago. Since then he has made
about $15,000. Murphy's contract as
manager called for 25 per cent of the
winnings of his charge. Since the
Cght with Britt Murphy has tried to
get Nelson to sign a contract to give
him 25 per cent, but Nelson refused to
accede to his proposal.
There have been many rumors that
Nelson intended to get a new manager.
"Billy" Pierce, a Boston sporting writ
er, was mentioned as anxious to look
after the affairs of the Battling Dane.
It was at first thought last night that
Murphy, fearing that Nelson intended
to turn him down and get a new man
ager, had decided to protect himself by
taking the money. Later on it was gen
erally agreed by the sporting men who
understand the attempts that have
been made to separate Nelson from his
manager that Murphy's disappearance
was merely a move to get Nelson away
from Fan Francisco and the persuasive
arguments of Pierce and his friends.
At an early hour this morning Cap
tain Burnett received a telegram in
forming him that Murphy and Santry
had been taken from the Santa Fe
train at Stockton. Murphy will be.
brought back to the city at once, if
Nelson swears out a warrant charging
him with embezzlement. He has been
directed by Captain Burnett to be at the
Hall of Justice at 9 a. m. to-day If he
desires Murphy brought back.

GRAND JURY MAY
UNCOVER A SCANDAL
IN POLICE CIRCLES
Sensational Developments Are
Expected Soon.
Men Prominent in the Department
Will Be Called Upon to Explain
Some Grave Charges.
CHIEF WITTMAN DENIES CHARGE.
Office Chief of Police,
SAX FRANCISCO, Dec 22, 1904.
To the Honorable Grand Jury of the City and County
of San Franciscoâ Gentlemen:' In the Evening Bulletin of
this date appears an article to the effect that Sergeant Ellis
of the regular police' force of this city had made a state
ment before a committee of your honorable body to the
effect that I had ordered him to allow gambling to go on in
Chinatown; hi other words "to be easy on the Chinese gam
biers,** he being specially detailed in the Chinese quarter for
the purpose of suppressing gambling there.
This statement, If made by Sergeant Ellis as stated In
the Bulletin, docs me a gross Injustice and is not true In
any particular, and I ask your honorable body to set a time
when I can "appearebcrorc^ybtraad give me. theTprivllege *of
giving my testimony that I may refute this unwarranted
charge if such has been made. Most respectfully,
GEORGE W. WITTMAX, Chief of Police.
There was promise yesterday afternoon of a scandal that would force
not only the policemen whose beats are the tenderloin district and China
town to come before the Grand Jury to answer charges that would be pre
ferred by Sergeant Thomas Ellis, who has been accused by Police Commis
sioner Hutton of having divulged certain plans for raids on the Chinese gam
blers, but that Chief "Wittman himself would have to explain to that tribunal
why Ellis was told to "overlook" corruption and let the lawbreakers alone.
Elite, was summoned before the Grand Jury last evening, and after per
sistent questioning he was unable, or unwilling, to give any information
that would in anyway tend to incriminate Chief "Wittman. In fact, he prac
tically said that the report that he had confessed was merely the result of
"gossip" and that he had not made any statement that, would tend to throw
discredit upon the police force, except, perhaps. In defending his reputation
he may have declared that he was not any more guilty than any other mem
ber of the police force. In matters appertaining to his duties in Chinatown,
he said, he was "always subject to orders." In this he simply meant that
he did as he was told to do and asked no questions, giving little attention
to the rumors that "graft" existed â only trying to prevent it as far as It was
possible for him to do so.
But Sergeant Ellis does not intend to be made a scapegoat by either
a Police Commissioner or a superior officer. If any one is to blame for
the troubles in Chinatown the sergeant wants it passed up to the offender,
and not placed upon his shoulders. He declared that he was Innocent of the
spreading of news of the intended raid by Hutton, and that it was evident
that some one was trying to make political capital of a condition that has
been supposed to exist for years,, but which has only been brought into
public prominence spasmodically.
ELLIS DENIES ATTACK OX CHIEF.
Ellis denied that he gave evidence that Implicated Chief Wittman to
any newspaper representative. He said that he had been frequently ap
proached by newspaper men. but had never given them a statement that
could be construed as a "confession." H*Â» was only anxious to protect him
self and avoid being heralded as a receiver of bribes, and the trend of his
defense seems to have been that he will go into history further back than
this year if he is accused by persons that are not above suspicion themselves.
District Attorney Byington and Grand Juryman Edward Bowes were
with Ellis during the early part of the evening. The trio held a conferecne
In the rear room of the Good Fellows' Grotto for nearly an hour, and when
Ellis came out he 1 accompanied Bowes down the street and boarded a Mar
ket-street car for a trip to the Hall of Justice. Ellis professed Ignorance of
the purport of a story published in an evening newspaper, and said that he
had not given any Information that could be used by the press with any de
gree of accuracy as to his relations with the Police Department scandal.
"If I talked to a reporter I did not know it." he added, "and I am sure
that I said nothing to any one who was not known to me as a Grand
Juryman." ,^
"My only aim in this matter is self-defense," he added. "I am not look
ing for any more trouble than I have already on my hands. I am in a
peculiar position as regards this investigation and it would be unwise for
me to say anything that would make enemies for me or Jeopardize the
friendships I have among department chiefs."
The Grand Jory was in session for three hours In the' Mills building, and
Ellis was frequently called. There are several rooms in the quarters, and
during the intervening, testimony offered by Policemen Heinz, Doran and
several minor witnesses the sergeant was requested to retire to one of the
ante-chambers.
He did not have opportunity to hear what was said of the exacting of
tribute from the Chinese and the fallen women of the tenderloin. Heinz is
said to have given testimony that shows that certain assessments were
levied in Hinckley alley and other notorious quarters, but if he did the ma
jority of the Grand Jurymen are not willing to acknowledge that they
have received any such statement.
BYIXGTON SITS WITH GRAM) JURY.
District Attorney Lewis Byington was with the Grand Jury during
their 'session. "I was only there In an advisory capacity." said Byington,
"and I can not-tell you whether or not Ellis made statements that incrimi
nate Chief Wittman or any one else. Part of the time I was with the Jury
Ellis was In another room."
â¢This is a matter that requires secrecy. To divulge the plans of the
Jury would be to defeat justiceâ that is if the case looks serious enough to
involve a point where Justice is to be summoned as an arbiter. There Is noth
ing that can be given out by me until I have made a more thorough Investi
gation."
Sergeant Ellis has not been on regular duty at the Harbor Police Sta
tion, to which he has been assigned since the trouble with; Commissioner
Hutton,' for ten days. He has been marked off the books as . on "special"
work, and the supposition is that he has been in frequent conference with the
foreman and members of the Grand Jury for a large part of that time. He
has been Instructed not to divulge any of the plans of the jury, and not
to affirm or deny any of the statements attributed to him by the press. . â¢

SAN FRANCISCO; FRIDAY, DECEMBER .23. 1904.
DEDUCES
STATEMENT
AS PERJURY
Wittman Denies He
â  . Ordered Gamblers â  â 
Protected.
Chief of Police Wittman was greatly
surprised when Informed that '"â  It had
been reported that Sergeant Ellis had
confessed that he had allowed gambling
to continue In Chinatown under secret
orders from his superior, Wittman. ,
"I do not believe In the first place
that Ellis ever made such a statement,"
said the Chief, "because I believe him
to be an honest .man. I do not believe
it possible that he made such a state
ment, and I must wait for better evi
dence before I will believe he made It;
but if he did there Is only one thing
I can say. and that is that he com
mitted deliberate, unwarranted, rank
perjury. If he made such a statement
as that, he knew when he made it that
he perjured himself and that he has
never received any order from me other
than to stop gambling in his district
and to be; relentless in the prosecution
of his duties.
"When Sergeant Ellis was put In
charge of the Chinatown squad I called
him and the members . of the squad
before me and told them in plain words
that a difficult duty confronted them,
but that it must be performed and that
they must prevent gambling among the
Chinese. Sergeant Â«Ellls Informed me
that he would see to It that my orders
were obeyed to the letter. â¢
"During his work In Chinatown I had
frequent conversations with }. him : re
garding conditions in his district, and
he generally Informed me that he was
succeeding In carrying out my orders.
On one or two occasions he - told me
that 'he thought perhaps some of the
Chinese^were stealing a game now and
then.-but whenever he heard of It ' he
had always managed : to suppress - the
game.* I told him to be on bis guard;
to watch i his men .closely and see j that
they did not 'throw.; him down,' and he
said he was,' confident?, all of . his j men
were doing the best- they, could and that
his work in the quarter would
be found satisfactory.BSwSJi^fefe

out Favor.
: Mayor Schmitz has taken a firm
stand regarding the developments in
the Chinatown scandal, one that prom
ises to Insure justice to all concerned
in the case.
"I say, as I have said before." said
the Mayor, "that I want this case in
vestigated to the end. I want this in
vestigation also to develop proof of
wrongdoing on the part of men la the
department before I will consent to see
them suffer. It is easy to charge men.
but it is harder to undo a wrong done
any man than It is to avoid doing him
that wrong.
"I will say now that I want this in
vestigation to proceed, and if any man
is proved guilty. Chief cf Police Witt
man. Sergeant Ellis or any patrolman.
I will be the first to ask the commis
sion to dismiss him from the force.
But if proof is not forthcoming as to
the guilt of any man charged with cor
ruption In this or any other case, I will
give him my support even if the whole
world is against him. I do not believe
in condemning men lightly. Deduc
tions are easy, but It Is proof that I
want. Let the proof be furnished. One
man's word against that of another Is
not proof.
"If Chief of Police Wittman Is guilty.
as it is charged he Is, the fact can be
established, and If a charge of corrup
tion asalnst him or any other man
can be established I shall ask his dis
missal. But I shall not fend my aid In
an effort to depose any man until it Is
proved beyond a doubt that he should
be deposed, and that the charges are
true. This has always, been my. stand
and will continue to be. in. the future."

COMMISSION
CHEATED OF
A WITNESS
Meets to Examine Ser
geant, but He Does
Not Appear.
Detective Department Ad
mits Its Inability to
Locate Him,
Shortly after the fact that Ellis wae
in the hands of the Grand Jury be
came public Mayor Schmitz was noti
fied that the. assertion had been made
tnat the sergeant had confessed that
corruption jexlsted In Chinatown, and
that Chief of Police Wittman was di
rectly responsible for the condition.
Mayor Schinitz immediately communi
cated with the secretary of the Police
Commission and informed him that it
was his, the Mayor's, desire that the
commission meet immediately, call Ellis
before it and continue the investiga
tion begun some weeks ago and get at
the facts, if possible.
Chief of Police Wittman was notified
that. his presence at the meeting was
desired, and he was requested to order
the attendance of Ellis, Ellis, however,
was not at the Harbor station, to
which he is attached, and Chief Witt
man Instructed Captain .of Detectives
Burnett ard Chief Clerk Norman to de
tail as many men as they could spare
to locate the much-wanted sergeant.
COMMISSIONERS GATHER.
Promptly at 7:30 o'clock Cpmmisslon
ers Drinkhouse, Howell and Reagan ar
rived at the commission rooms. Word
from Hutton was ro the effect that he
misrht be present at the meeting, but
could not say positively.] However,
Hutton put in "an appearance shortly
after this announcement was made. He
was not. enthusiastic regarding the idea
of the commission proceeding with the
examination of Ellis, in view of the
fact that EU5s was occupying the deli
cate position of:, witness before the
Grand Jury- 'â¢â â¢*'â¢. â¢
"We will all be up for contempt if wo
attempt to. examine Ellis regarding his
alleged confession,";- said Hutton. '.'and
1 do not think this is the proper time to
take tuib up.f,. ,. V
-,. "But," interjected Howell, . "wÂ« need
not tread' on. dangerous ground.. All. we
w.nnt to determine, is whether he has
testifkd before the .Grand Jury or not.
Wh?n we determine this question we
can stop, if we are so advised."
KL.IJS IS MISSING.
At this point in' the dialogue Chief
Wittman entered the commission
chamber, and said that he had been in
formed that Ellis could not be found.
Inquiry at the Grand Jury rooms had
elicited the information that he was
not tlit-re. and the detective department
had admitted its inability to locate him
in the 'limited time remaining.
"Well, we will wait until 8:30 o'clock."
eaid Drinkhouse, "and If he falls to put
in an appearance by that time there Is
but one thin* to do and that is to take
a conCinuance until 'to-morrow- after
noon, when we meet to consider other
matters."
The hour of 6:30 arrived and Ellis
was etill among- the" "absent. Drink
house's statement had been taken for
granted, and the. Commissioners with
out formal actlon.filed.oiit of the room.
None of the Commissioners had any
thing to say regarding the sudden de
velopment in the Chinatown scandal.
AH they could do, they said, was to,con
tinue the investigation to a finality,
which they purpdsed' doing when 'they
could get the proper witnesses 'before
them. ; " â  Â» - . '.-â¢'

UNCOVER A SCANDAL

When the police committee convened in the evening there were five police
men pacing the corridor waiting to be called to testify. They were William
Doran, Henry M. Heinz, R. R. O'Brien Charles E. Munn and Gilbert P. Chase.
All but Chase are among those against whom charges . of neglect of d,uty
were preferred by Commissioner Hutton. O'Brien was on the grill for a
long time, but it is said that the most satisfactory witness*, was Heinz. One
report has It that he gave the committee some good points for their future
investigation.
Every effort was made to preserve secrecy, and a policeman was on
duty to prevent strollers from going too near the Grand Jury rooms. Ser
geant Ellis was concealed most erf the evening in the witness-room. He
remained for some time after the Grand Jurors had departed in the hope
that the newspaper men would be gone and that he could escape them.
Those who waited had small reward for their patience, for Ellis refused
positively to say a word.
Foreman Andrews refused to deny or affirm the l-eport that Ellis had
made a confession or any statement implicating himself or any others In
wrongdoing in Chinatown. He declared that a large part of that which had
reached public print was ludicrous. The committee would have no report to
make at the session of the Grand Jury this afternoon further than that prog
ress was being made.
WANTS TO WITHDRAW
FROM OFFICIAL BONDS
Company Asks t o Be Relieved as
Sureties for Commissioners
Schinitz and Maestretti.
The United States Fidelity Com
pany yesterday filed notice upon Aud
itor Baehr* of its desire to withdraw
as surety upon the official bonds of
Herbert L. SehmitSK and Frank A.
Maestretti. Commissioners of Public
Works. The notice states that its
reason for its desire to withdraw from
the bonds is that it fears it will sus
tain loss if it remains longer thereon.
The bondsare for 525,000 each.
Auditor Baehr is in doubt as to
whether the company may withdraw
from the bonds and has submitted the
point to his attorney, William H.
Cobb, for an opinion. Should the
withdrawal be legal it will be neces
sary for Schmits and Maestretti to file
new bonds. â¢'â 
' "I understand," said Schmitz. "that
the reason the company Wants to
withdraw from our bonds is that the
Superior Court has decided that we
as Commissioners are individually li
able for the city's responsibility re
garding defective streets and side
walks. The surety company believes
the risk to be great in view of the
judgments that might be obtained
against us on that rulinsr."
Commissioner Casey, whose official
bond was declared unsatisfactory by
the Finance Committee last month,
has not yet filed a new bond and will
proba"Â»Jy not do so since he is short
ly to retire from public office.

LARGE BRIBERY
FUND REVEALED
New York Grand Jury Un
covers Alleged Scandal,
but Can Indict No One
NEW YORK, Dec. 22.â No evidence
warranting indictments In this county
was presented to the Grand Jury in
connection wfth the charge that a
bribery fund had been collected by the
Liquor Dealers' Association to influ
ence legislation at Albany, according to
a presentment handed In to-day.
The presentment described as "shock-
Ing" the facts discloeed by the evidence
and after asserting that it had been im
possible to return Indictments in this
country, requested that all the evidence
â 175 typewritten pages â be sent to the
Governor and to both branches of the
Legislature to do with it as they see fit.
The Grand Jury says it appears from
evidence submitted to it that the Li
quor Dealers' Association, which ex
tends throughout the State, from time
to time raises money from Its members
and applies it for political purposes. It
was shown that a large sum of money
was raised In this way during the pres
ent year and that it finally wai re
ceived by a committee known as the
legislation committee, which .went fre^
quently to Albany " while" the Legisla
ture was in session and took with it the
money in cash.
Continuing, the report of the jury
says that the evidence presented .to it
showed "that this legislation commit
tee allowed its disbursing officer to give
a considerable part of this money to
one of the State departments of this
State in seemingly an unlawful way;
that a large part of this money was,
by this legislation committee, expended
upon various members of the Assembly
and the Senate of the State of New
York and their friends, in appalling
and shocking ways, with the intention
of influencing such members in the dis
charge of their official duty as mem
bers of the Assembly or Senate."
After reading the report Judge Cow
ing said he would see to it that copies
would be forwarded to the Governor
and branches of the Legislature as re
quested,- with the request that they
take such action as the evidence war
rants.
The story that first reached Mr.
Jerome and started his investigation
was that a fund of $50,000 had been col
lected by the liquor dealers to influence
legislation at Albany.

STORY AS PERJURY
Continued From Page 1, Column 4.
"It was only as short a time ago as
11 o'clock this morning that I had a
conversation with him regarding his
work in Chinatown. Some 80 bench
warrants for the arrest of Chinese that
were implicated in the raid by Com
missioner Hutton of the place kept by
Chin Kim You were handed to me for
service. As Sergeant Ellis was in Chi
natown at the time of Hutton's raid,
and would be able to identify more of
the accused than any other man, I sent
him to serve these warrants.
"This morning I was informed that a
writ of certiorari had been issued by
Judge Slosf, that I had been summoned
for comtempt of court for seeking to
serve these warrants, and in addition
sued for $25,000 damages, and I called
Ellis in and told, him to turn in the
warrants and to serve no more of them
until the contempt proceedings had
been disposed of. This was at 11
o'clock this forenoon, and while Ellis
was in my room I questioned him fur
ther as to his work in Chinatown.
"I said to him: 'Ellis', Is it not possi
ble that some of your men deceived
you while you were in Chinatown and
failed to properly perform their duty,
perhaps for a consideration?'
" 'No, it is not possible," Ellis an
swered and continuing said: 'I did my
work as â¢well as any man could have
done it in Chinatown. The charge that
we permitted gambling to go uninter
rupted is not true. I know all of my
ADVERTISEMENTS.
men did their duty as I did. and that
the only gambling that occurred during
my time there was when some Chinese
would steal a game or two during our
absence from their quarter, while we
were engaged in suppressing other
games. I made many good hauls there
as the records will show. The charge
are false.'
. "This Is what he said to me. and yet
the report comes to me now that he has
confessed that he did permit gambling
to go on in Chinatown, and this under
secret orders from me. I repeat again
that I do not believe he made any such
statement, but if he did I repeat with
more vehemance that he committed de
liberate, unwarranted, rank perjury,
for what purpose I, of course, cannot
determine at this time.
"Ag our interview was drawing to a
close, I asked him if he had been served
with charges. He said. he had, and
showed them to me. I told him that
I hoped he could prove his Innocence,
but informed him that the charge
against him was a serious one, and I
advised him to get a good lawyer and
prepare his defense. He said he would
do so. The next I heard of Ellis was
when I was informed that he had testi
fied before the Grand Jury that he had
permitted gambling to" run In China
town because I had secretly ordered
him to. I need not reiterate my con
tention as to the truth of this Â«tate
ment. if It was made. 1 have done

NEW YORK, Dec 22.â The Jury in

at. and immediately following It a
statement that Judge Davis would give

The hope of a verdict was dispelled.
howe\'er, when & few minutes before
11:20 ojclock Captain Lynch of the
court squad said that 'it was all
of!" and the Jury would be locked up
for the night.
Miss Patterson heard the news in the
"pen" and it was so unexpected to her
that Ehe came near collapsing. It was
understood that the jury would con
tinue consideration of the case in the
email Jury room, containing only a
few tables and chairs, and the Jurors
-v.ill have no opportunity to sleep un
less they^can doze in the Email chairs.
As soon as the Jury was locked up
for the night. Miss Patterson bade her
father a tearful farewell and was es
corted from the "pen" in the court
building to her cell in the Tombs. The
girl, who showed such courage through
the lone trial, is almost a nervous
wreck. The great strength she form
erly evinced has failed and she repeat
edly exclaimed: "Oh. how can those
men doubt zny word."
NINE FOR ACQUITTAL.
There will be on opportunity of hear
ing from the Jury again until 10:30
o'clock to-morrow, the hour fixed by
the court for a report frexn the twelve
men who are to decide the fate of the

Immediately after the announcement
that the jury was locked for the night,
officers cleared the corridors of the
court building of scores of newspaper
men arid attornej'E, who had anxiously
awaited news from the jury- Mur
murs of disappointment "were heard
from the crowd, which seemed con
vinced that the Jury would never reach
a decision.
The latest rumor from the Jury room
Â«as that three men were holding out
against nine who desired to acquit the
litrfendant. It was reported that the
three Jurors were at odds as to the
seriousness of the crime. One Juror Ib
eajd xj be holding out for conviction
for murder in the second degree and
tv.o others are rei>orted to favor man

One rumor was so definite that it
named a Juror who had asked if he

DISAGREEMENT EXPECTED.
Disappointed crowds in the streets

moment was under consideration.
NERVE-RACKING AFTERNOON.
Miss Patterson, after the Jury retired
at noon, spent the afternoon and even-
Ing between her cell in the Tombs and
what Is known as the "pen" on the
third floor of the court building* Most of
the afternoon was spent in the Tombs.
As she was led from the court after
the Jury retired she witnessed a mar
riage ceremony between two prisoners
and congratulated them. For a mo
ment her face brightened, as though
she had forgotten her own troubles,
but soon afterward resumed its look of
sad calm. While she was in the Tombs
this afternoon she opened numerous
telegrams and letters from relatives
and friends, congratulating her upon
her defense and expressing the hope
and wish that her freedom was near at
hand. One of the messages was from
her mother, who has not been able to
attend the trial. It is said she hoped
to have her daughter for Christmas.
This evening after her dinner she was
taken to the "pen," where she was
Joined by her father, who has been con
stant in his support of his daughter
since she was first accused of the crime,
and who has been her faithful ally and
companion every day in court. No one
else saw Miss Patterson during the
evening and the fact that she was
taken from the jail to the court indi
cated that she still expected a verdict,
notwithstanding that the jury had con
sumed hours in discussion without
reaching a finding. One of her counsel
was about the building this evening,
but did not see his client.
MOTHER'S PITIFUL MESSAGE.
The abiding faith of the young wom

to-night, when she expressed the opin

"I almost feel sure I will leave here

When she said this her face was tense

twenty-five men In the mine and all but
eeven were rescued, though they were
all in bad condition and two /more are
likely to die.
A Email building, about sixteen by
twenty, burned at the mouth of the
mine. The airshaft from the working
to the surface some distance in the
mine acted as a sort of flue and drew
into the drift the heat and smoke from
the fire, thus suffocating the men,
whose escape was shut off by the fire
at the opening.

HULL MEN CHANGE FRONT.
LONDON. Dec. 22â The publication in
St. Petersburg that the Hull fishermen
have voluntarily deposed that foreign
torpedo boats were among the trawlers
off Dogger Bank when the latter were
fired upon by ships of the Russian fleet
is probably nothing more than a repeti
tion of similar statements emanating
from Hull and appearing in London pa
pers the last few days. These are cir
cumstantial and it would certainly ap
pear to be true that some men of the
Gamecock -fleet have made statements
before the Russian Consul.
The name of only one of these has
been revealed. He is the boatswain of
the trawler Ava and he said to-day
that he was induced to make the state
ment while he was intoxicated.
The sensational press of England di
rectly charges the Russian Govern
ment with using underhand means, by
bribery and intoxicants, to secure false
statements from men of the Gamecock
fishing fleets - â¢
The Russian Consul at Hull to-night
said the boatswain of the Ava was
brought to his office, but that he sent
him to the Commissioner of Oaths,
where, the Consul says, the boatswain
swore he saw a Japanese torpedo boat
with the trawlers. The Consul says he
knows of other trawlers who are ready
to make similar statements, but that
they are afraid of the consequences.
The Consul indignantly denies that he
has made any attempt to induce fisher
men to make statements. He says that
when informed of the nature of the
statement the boatswain of the Ava in
tended to make it was his duty to his
Government. to render every assistance
MAY EXPLAIN THE INCIDENT.
Altogether an air of mystery: . sur
rounds the affair, but no credence in
responsible quarters is given to the al
legations that unfair methods have
been used by the Russian Government.
One explanation emanates from Par
is, where it is said that two reporters
of the. Petit Parisienne recently visited
Hull in order to interview men of the
Gamecock fleet and secure independ
ent information concerning the Dogger

reports assumes to identify the

calling them "foreigners employed by

Baltic Fleet in
JL/V_ LCtl I.
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« Call
SHANGHAI, Dec 22.â A squadron of
powerful cruisers under Admiral Kam
imura has gone south to the China Sea
to meet the Russian second Pacific
Squadron.
SINGAPORE, -Straits Settlement.
Dec. 22.â Two Japanese converted
cruisers, the Nippon Maru and the
Hongkong Maru, entered Singapore
Strait this morning and anchored in
the roadstead, seven miles from Singa
pore City, at noon. These cruisers are
sea scouts of the Japanese battle fleet,
which is composed of two first-class
battleships, two' .first-class armored
cruisers,. two second-class cruisers and
a flotilla of twelve torpedo craft. These
vessels are now on their way to a cer
tain place, where they intend to give
.battle to part of the Baltic fleet, i
According to the Japanese captain,
the naval situation at Port Arthur be
ing ndw settled and the Russian fleet
entirely disabled, " Admiral Togo has
turned his attention to the outcoming
fleet. He declined to /give any further
Information, but admitted that he
would go west a/id south and had called
here to communicate with the Japanese
Consul.
It is believed here that the Japanese
have a secret base "among: the islands
and will attempt to seize colliers and
boats carrying contraband to the Rus
sian fleet in these wafers. The Japan
ese cruisers left at 1:30 o'clock this aft
ernoon. !
ST. PETERSBURG. Dec. 22.â The an
nouncement that four Japanese cruis
ers and twelve torpedo boats are pro
ceeding west from Singapore is re
ceived here with much interest It is
not believed, however, that such a
small squadron can have been sent out
by Japan with an, idea of engaging in
offensive operations, but it is regarded
as more probable that it- is the pur
pose of this squadron to keep a sur
veillance over the two detachments of
the Russian fleet which are expected
to soon unite in the neighborhood of
Madagascar. It is generally believed
that Vice Admiral JRojestvensky in
tends to establish a naval coaling base
on . spme small island between Mada
gascar and the Philippines and that
the Japanese cruising squadron is to
mark the rendezvous for Vice Admiral
Togo's information. The belief is ex
pressed that Admiral Rojestvensky will
be able to catch up with the Japanese
scouts, who, it is believed, he could
easily destroy, thereby^weakening the
Japanese in the final naval engage
ment *
CZAR ANGERED
BY A PETITION
ST. PETERSBURG, Dec. 22.âEm
peror Nicholas formally notified the
country to-day that agitation for a
constitution and the convocation of a
National Assembly is. useless. Such is
the construction placed upon the in
dorsement written in his own hand on
the resolutions telegraphed by the
Chernigov Zemstvo on .December 20.,
begging him in the most loyal manner
to convocate legally elected members
of the Zemstvos to present a pro
gramme of reform for his considera
tion. The Emperor wrote on the dis
patch:
I consider the action of the President to be
presurnptyoua and . tactWis. Questions of 8 tate
administration ' are of no concern to the
Z^nistvos, whose functions and rights- are
clearly defined by. the law.
The indorsement was printed in the
Official Messenger this morning, dash-
Ing the hopes of the extremists. It
dogs not come as a great surprise.
The Emperor,* from the beginning, al
though he has shown himself favor
ably disposed toward a more liberal
regime and in entire sympathy with
some of the Zemstvo demands, had re
solved not to yield the principle of
autocracy. Upon this point, it is un
derstood, all his advisers, including
Interior Minister . SylatopolkvMirsky,
agreed, but the character of the agi
tation followed the" meeting of the
presidents of ,the Zemstvos, and the
action 'of. various provincial Zemstvos
arid municipal councils, coupled with
the recent demonstrations at 'st Pe
tersburg, .Moscow and elsewhere, prob
ably served, to strengthen, the hands
ot the reactionaries and convinced'. the
Emperor of . "the imperative necessity;

Ssecial Dispatch to The Call
BOSTON, Mass., Dec. 22.â Thomas W.
Lawson to-day made this statement:
/"Last Friday I said, in speaking of
how fictitious transactions werafmade
on the Stock. Exchange for the purpose
of making bogus, prices, with intent to
defraud buyers and sellers of securities:
'I have a five or six page corroborative
letter from Mames R. Keene.'
"Mr. Keene denied my statement, and
said he had only written a short note
of two pages, and if I did not publish it
he would the following Monday. . I an
swered: 'All right; go ahead.' He did
not publish it Monday or Tuesday. â¢ I
prepared to on Wednesday. Late Tues
day night he sent me word that if I re
frained he would publish his copy on
Thursday, and he did. What he pub
lished is a correct copy of the full five
page letter I have in my possession.
"First, I would say Mr. Keene's letter
to me was not a confidential communi
cation. On the contrary, it was written
that I might use it in my story.
"Second, I have no desire to do or say
anything to annoy or injure Mr. Keene.
My writings in the past' and that part
of my story wherein I have already
spoken of him show plainly my feelings
about him, and my treatment of him
in the coming chapter of my story,
which will be devoted to him, will fur
ther show my feelings; but in treating
Mr. Keene I must, as in case of all oth
ers whom I describe or whose actions
I relate, show the exact line of truth. ,
KEENE'S STRENUOUS WORK.
"For years there was in the employ
of William Rockefeller a man who han
dled all confidential transactions and
papers connected with ' them of the
'Standard Oil.' In the midst of the pop
per deal a great 'leak', was discovered
at 26 Broadway. Enormous transac
tions were being > conducted "in Wall
street, ostensibly in the name of 'Stand
ard Oil'â that is, when certain stock
deals -were rcade, rumor credited them
to 'Standard Oil.' A most thorough se
cret investigation was started, but
without success. Traps were laid and
finally game was found in them .and the
'leak' discovered. ;
"Consternation reigned at the 'Sys
tem's' shrine, j Mr.,- Rockefeller's confi
dential man was quietly 'dismissed.
Simultaneously with his dismissal a
tremendous Third-avenue bomb was
exploded and the world, particularly
the financial world, for a short day was
allowed a glimpse of the terribly black
duplicity which at all times underlies
Wall street. The services of the Grand
Jury were sought and things for a few
days looked ominous for certain men.
"The hatred of 'Standard Oir for
James R. Keene at this time was selling
at over par. The necessities of James
R. Keene were pressing, flrsf for for
giveness and the good will of 'Standard
Oil'; next, in connection with his rub
ber stocks. A certain man succeeded in
amalgamating the 'Standard Oil' hatred
of Keene and the Keene necessities,
and James R. Keene foiled up hia
sleeves for the most strenuous piece of
work in his most strenuous life, and
-the fur flew â the people's fur.
STANDARD OIL TREACHERY.
VIn consideration of Keene . doing a
good job up brown, the 'Standard Oil"
would'subseribe one-half of the money
necessary to float the new rubber com
pany and loan its magic name to the
enterprise. First, the total amount was
$5,000,000. 'Standard Oil' $2,500,000; then
$10,000,000, 'Standard Oil' $5,000,000;
finally $15,000,000, 'Standard Oil' $7,500.
000. Public announcement was made
and everything went as merty as a
steam clipper at a fleecing bee, and
Keene completed his job, andâ well,
'Standard OH 1 never forgives an in
jury. â¢ .;... ,-\ '-"â :â  '...
.."Suddenly its' subscription and its
name were yanked away from the new
rubber company* and James R. Keene
was longer of experience and shorter
of faith than ever before" in his mar

Edwin Lu Pike Leaves Be

Sr.Â»ri-il Disrateh to ThÂ« Call
NEWPORT, R. I., Dec. 22.â Sergeant
Allen C. Griffith, armed with a war
rant for the arrest of Edwin L*. Pike,
private secretary of George H. Norman,
multi-millionaire, left Newport* early
to-day for Boston to apprehend the
secretary, but up to a late hour to
nisht he had not been able to locate
him. (
Pike kept sumptuous apartments on
Bellevue avenue. He dressed well â In
fact, was a Beau Brummel, and was
envied bythe young men of his set. He
kept a valet and maintained two estab
lishments.
Pike's disappearance, with the fact
that he was secretary to George H.
Norman, has given Newport its biggest
sensation in years.
Yesterday Norman returned from
New York and was unable to flrtd his
secretary, who had been left in charge
of his personal business affairs. Upon
examination of his accounts, which
were not found in a .satisfactory con
dition, Norman immediately obtained a
writ of attachment to be served upon
the secretary's account in the National
Exchange Bank, but no balance was
found. An attachment was placed on
Pike's personal property and at his
boarding-house a keeper was placed in
charge.
Norman had been accustomed to turn
over to his secretary considerable sums
of money, with which to meet personal
obligations. These sums were deposited
by the secretary to his awn account
and drawn on by the secretary's
checks. Norman went away a week
ago and left $2000 with his secretary.
It is reported that there are several
personal accounts of Pike which are
left unpaid.

WASHINGTON, Dec 22.â In his strug
gle with the interstate commerce
problem, his desire being to see the

called Secretary Morton into confer
ence a great deal lately, appreciating his
knowledge and experience as a railroad
man. It now develops, according., to a
New York statesman who is close to
both the President and the Secretary,
and who talked to both on the subject
to-day, that Secretary Morton has a
very strong leaning toward the rail
road interests In this business and has
upheld them to such an extent that he
and the President show signs of drift

It is said that Morton has urged upon
the President the right of the railroads
to pool ,ln their service to', terminal
points where they are now competitors.
This point is one which the railroads
have long been claiming, and Secretary
Morton is reported to have said that if
it be now granted all opposition on
their part to the proposed extension of
the powers of the Interstate Com
merce Comnjission would be with
drawn.
The President, however, declines to
make this concession, according to the
authority referred to, and the discus

PORT JERVIS. N. T.. Dec 22.-Un
heard of for fourteen years, during
whiSh time he had been mourned as onÂ«
dead by -family and friends. F. C. Hol
ley, a once prosperous business man of
New Tprk, has written to his only sur
viving relatives announcing: that he Is
alive. He tells an extraordinary story
of confinement in a South American
prison. Holley's letter came from Bu
caramanga in the department of San
tanda. Colombia, South America, to his
mother, who lives in Otisville, N. T.
Holley was a salesman for the Inger
soll Drill Company. He was successful,
and it was just fourteen years ago that
a letter reached his mother announcing:
that he had completed a $23,000 contract
in one of the important cities of Co
lombia, and was about to start for
home. That was the last, heard from
him from that day until to-day. Noth
ing concerning him had been learned,
an exhaustive Investigation was futlla
and eventually the supposition that ha
had met death in some remote place
was accepted.
When he went to South America Hol
ley had a wife and two sons In a cozy
homo In Homowac, Ulster County. N.
Y. . The wife, still mourning him. died
several years ago and both sons werÂ«
killed in accidents. Holley does not
know this and makes an anxious In
quiry In his letter. He gays that when
he arrived in Colombia one of the then
frequent revolutions was in progress,
but he took no particular Interest in it
and proceeded to transact his business.
He had done so and was on the eve of
leaving town when, without a word of
warning, he was arrested as a political
prisoner and without an explanation
of the nature of his offense thrown into
a dungeon.
In the vicissitudes of Colombian poli
tics and the many changes in the Gov
ernment he was finally forgotten, and
as all communication with the outside
world was dented him he could not
even learn which of the contending
parties had caused his arrest and Ions
captivity.

ADVERTISEMENTS.
WRONG IDEA.
' Don't set the wrong idea into your
headf that starvation Is good for dys-
pepsia.
It's not.
Those who have not studied the sub-
ject very deeply, or with trained scien-
tific %ninds, might think so.
But facts prove otherwise.
All specialists in stomach and diges-
tive disorders know that it Is best for
dyspepsia to be well fed.
Why, dyspepsia is really a starvation
disease!
.Your food doesn't feed you.
By. starvation, you may give your
bowels and kidneys less to do. but that
does not cure your digestive trouble^ â
simply makes you weaker and sicker:
less likely to be permanently cured
than ever.
No, the only right way to permanent-
ly cure yourself of any form of dyspep-
sia or indigestive trouble, is to eat
heartily of all the food that you find
best agrees with you, and help your
digestion to work with Stuart's Dys-
pepsia, Tablets.
This Is a safe, certain, scientific, re-
liable method of treatment, .which will
never fail to cure the most obstinate
cases If persevered In.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets have a
gentle, tonic, refreshing effect on the
secretory glands of the entire digestive
tract
They gently force the flow of fresh
digestive Juices.
They contain, themselves, many of
the chemical constituents of these
Juices, thus when dissolved they help
to dissolve the food around them in
stomach or bowels.
They therefore quickly relieve all the

So little suggestive of the spiritual
was the personality of 3Ime. Annie
Waltman. accused of practicing occult
ism without licecse in a Sixth-street
chamber of mystery", that Prosecuting
Attorney Harris audibly hoped the
complaint was not a blunder. His mis
giving was justified by the 250 pounds
avoirdupois that filled the witness chair
and bulged over its arms and the fail
ure of a mammoth picture hat to
diminish by contrast the amplitude of
a good-natured countenance embrac
ing three chins.
"The seeress of tradition," remarked
Mr. Harris to Police Judge Fritz, "is
either an airy, fairy, fragile creature,
conveying the impression of flesh being
consumed by soul-fires, or a statu
esque female of mien both serene and
mystic. This defendant fills neither
of these bills. If she's guilty of this
charge she is also an innovation, phy
sicaJly and intellectually."
"Let's hear the testimony," said the
Judge.
"Madam, can you reveal the future?"
inquired the attorney.
"Young man," was the guttural re-
Eponse. "Wen you've lived as I've lived
an' si>erienced w'at I've sperienced you
may be able to peek inter th' footer."
"You are accused of charging money
for your revelations?"
"I don't charge nothin' ter nobuddy i
for my visions, an' them as says I do
will answer for their lyin* to a mightier
jiower than I be. If any pore creatur
is in trouble an' wants a revelation I
give it, an' if any grateful pusson
sees fit to hand me money I take it.
But I makes no charges."
"Then you are conducting an elee
mosynary institution?"
"Xuthin* of th' kind." was the brid
ling rejoinder. "No matter what th'
Ekiptics Bay6, I'm a decent woman."
The case was continued till Decem

abandon hobnobbing with the unseen

Patrolmen Kramer and Joy united In

â¢Toughey," the stellar bully and black
guard of the Barbary Coast, and hinted
that hie incarceration for a protracted
period would contribute to their mental
relief and conduce to the promotion of
peace on their beau They arrested him
in accordance with Chief "Wittman's
proclaimed desire to have the city
purged of masculine creatures who are
dependent for livelihood upon the
bouDty of disreputable women, and
they were heavily laden with proofs
that he came fairly within the scope of
the righteous ukase. They described
as his "meal ticket" a female who
queens it over her sisters in degrada
tion by the same intimidatory violence
that he exercises in maintenance of his
position as the unholy terror of their
degenerate consorts. The woman was
hardly less muscular and cruel than the
man, and he was credited with more
clean knockouts than any half dozen
professional pugilists in history. He
had repeatedly been convicted of bat
tery, but imprisonment seemed to have
no restrictive effect upon his savagery.
He recently completed a twelvemouth
term, and came out of jail just as vi
cious as he went in. The court would
make no mistake in sentencing him to
the six-month limit for vagrancy.
Judge Mogan inspected his records
and found that they corroborated the
policemen's allegations as to "Tough
ey's" character. Then the case was
taken under advisement till January 5,
the defendant being remanded to cus
tody until that date.
Tom Co-le, chronic vagabond, w.is

"I got it from a lady in Sausaleeter,"
said Tom to Judge Conlan. "She's an
o!e fiien' of mine, an' handed it to me
as a Christmas present."
It looked like acquittal for him until
he voluntarily adduced the information
that he rode to Sausalito from Suisun
on a street car. He will be sentenced
for defective geography.

negro, denied that he disturbed the

WANT POLICE ENJOINED
Snlt for Damages and Injunction
Filed, but Temporary Order Is
Denied by Judge Kerrigaii-
The proprietresses of the eight
houses on Belden place which were
raided by the police Wednesday night
decided yesterday to seek the custom
ary relief in injunction, but at the
hour of adjourning the Superior courts
the relief had not been granted. A
complaint directed against Chief of
Police Wittman for Injunction and
$10,000 damages was filed during the
afternoon by Attorney C. G. Xagle.
The case was assigned to Department
4, but Judze Hebbard was not in and
Xagle applied to Judge Kerrigan for
a temporary restraining order to pre
vent a repetition of the raid during
the trial of the suit- Judge Kerrigan
declined to grant it.
The action is in behalf of Elysa
Malenoire and seven other women,
who aver that they hold lodging-house
licenses and are engaged in renting
their premises for lodging purposes.
They declare that the action" of the
police Is unwarranted and has inter
fered w!th their rights and the con
duct of their business, hence the dam
ages alleged !n the amount sued for.

Corroborative testimony obtained
Mr. Crouch's dismissal.* ' â 
"He's a capper for a quack," was the
policeman's introductory speech as
John Brown, emaciated and sallow,
was nrraigned before Judge Mogan on
the charge of vagrancy.
Then the ofheer went on to explain
that the defendant's "capping" consist
ed of falsely representing himself as
one who had been plucked from the
grave's edge by a certain putative
healer of physical ailments and thus
inducing unsophisticated invalids to
visit said practitioner, by whom he was
paid a percentage of whatever money
was obtained from them. John's plan
of operation was to loiter In hotel cor
ridors and other places where men con
gTegate until he saw a person seem
ingly in need of medical attention,
whom he would engage in conversation.
After adroitly ascertaining the nature
of the stranger's disease John would
tell in tones indicative of gratitude of
how he was completely cured of that
very ill after he had given up all hopes
of recovery and was resignedly await
ing the grim reaper's summons.
"Go to my doctor at once," John
would say with enthusiasm. "He won't
charge you a cent for consultation."
Then awny John would hurry to de
scribe to his ajly the symptoms which
had been described to him by their
owner, and when the latter visited the
"doctor" he would be astonished at
the knowledge of his case shown by
that person.
"I'm too weak to work, and you don't
want me to starve, do you?" said John
to the Judge.
"Then jail's the best place for you,"
was the response.
"But my familyâ what's to become
of them if I go to jail?"
"Can you find no other means of
earning a living than by preying on the
fear and credulity of sick folk?"
"Well. I could play the races if I
had money."
He was dismissed with a caution to
"cap" no more.

ENDEAVORS TO
SEE CHILDREN
Former Wife of King Fred
erick Augustus Pays Un
expected Visit to Palace
REFUSED ADMITTANCE
Princess Escorted to the
Depot in Dresden by Cheer
ing Crowd of Sympathizers
DRESDEN, Dec 22.â The former
Crown Princess Louise arrived here un
expectedly to-day. Accompanied by a
lawyer, 'she proceeded to Taschenberg
Palace and asked to be permitted to
see her children. Permission, however,
was peremptorily refused, and the
Princess announced her intention of
leaving Dresden this afternoon. King
Frederick Augustus, who is on a shoot
ing excursion, has been informed of the
arrival of his former wife.
The Princess voluntarily left the city
this afternoon for Leipsic. An immense
cheering crowd escorted her to the rail
road, station. The Princess, who had
written to the King that unless he
granted her oft-repeated request to see
her children she would attempt to see
them without his permission, arrived
here unexpectedly from Vienna last
night with a woman companion.
The police were informed and then
the ministry sent a telegram to the
King at.Pillnitz, who directed that she
should on no account be admitted to
the. palace, but that she should not be
arrested unless she became violent.
The Princess went alone to one of the
entrances of the Palace, on Theater
square, at 9 o'clock In the morning,
dressed in mourning. A lieutenant of
police saluted the Princess and told her
quietly, that it would be # impossible for
her to. enter the palace. ; > : V:
The former Crown Princess stood on
the steps trembling and a few guards
and policemen who surrounded her
thought she' was about to fall. The
Princess recovered herself somewhat
and said three or four times: "Please
let me see my children."
The lieutenant replied that his orders
were, peremptory and offered to walk
with her to the Hotel Bellevue.
She returned to her hotel, received no
one and lunched in her room. In the
meantime many hundreds of persons
collected- in the neighborhood of the ho
tel. Dr. Sexme, the attorney of the
former Crown Princess, called and to
gether they drove to the railroad sta
tion and took a train for Leipsic, de
signing to return to Vienna.
Public sympathy runs in favor of the
request of the Princess to see her chil
dren once a year, as the German law
provides in the case of mothers di
vorced for the most flagrant offenses.
The ministry was much disturbed
over thej.posslbility of popular disturb
ances and assembled at mid-day to
consider the measures that might be
necessary. The. police were directed to
notify the Princess that she must leave
the city by 4 p. m. and that she would
not be allowed to communicate with
any one except her attorney. The Prin
cess sent a letter to the Court Marshal
asking if, she could visit her children
and after receiving an answer In the
negative she left Dresden on the next
train. ' *V

COLORADO SPRINGS. Colo., Dec.
22. â Several, clews were run down by
the officers 'to-day 'without establishing
the Identity of the young woman mur
dered on Qutler. Mountain. Mrs, Mamie
Swift, .who disappeared from this city
four weeks ago, was -located to-day at
the home of her brother In Victor. Mrs.
Sadie Durant of Pueblo is still missing,
but the officers. do not believe she was
the murdered woman. City Marshal
Cree of .Manitou reported to-day the
disappearance of a young woman, an
Invalid, who, prior to three weeks ago.
was living in a tent on the outskirts of
that town. ; - - .
This afternoon men began dragging
In the : Portland mill reservoir in the
hope of finding the murdered woman's
clothing. This work was undertaken
because a strip of blood-stained muslin
had been found in < the reservoir.
A statement made to-day by J. M.
Davis, keeper of the toll gate at Chey
enne Canyon, raises a strong presump
tion that the . murder was committed
about 3 o'clock Sunday afternoon, De
cember , 18. " . . .
"I remember distinctly hearing a shot
fired on lthe_ other, side, of the, cliff in
front of the toll gate about that hour,"
said Davis.'. "The reason I noticed it
was because it is against the law to
shoot In the canyon." -
City Detective McReynolds has dis
covered the first real clew In the mur
der mystery that the officers have had
to work -:on since the discovery of the
body of the unknown woman. The
clew consists of a one-ounce bottle la
beled poison, which was found within
fifty feet of the spot where the body of
the murdered, girl was discovered. The
label, though partially destroyed, is be
lieved to be' sufficient to lead the de
tectives-to the druggist who sold the
poison and may eventually lead to the
capture of the murderer.
-In the immediate vicinity of the bot
tle was found a linen handkerchief of
ordinary size, hemstitched, and bearing
In the corner the laundry mark "D.
I. C."
Officers are making a careful search
for the missing portion of the label
from the bottle. This label is the regu
lation red lx>ison label, but from the
center had been scratched the major
portion of the name of the druggist and
the address.

ODESSA, Dec. 22. â The question
whether Jews are prohibited by their

Cronstein appealed, alleging that al

that the. practice was now being fol

BANK DIRECTOR IS DISCHARGED
STOCKHOLDERS EVICT H. C. MORRIS
He Says His Boldness in Accusing Officer
of Forgery Cost Him Position.
OAKLAND. Dec. 22.â The stockhold
ers of the Central Bank met to-day and
voted to remove H. C. Morris from the
directory of thÂ«Â» institution, but did not
fill his xÂ»!ace.
This is the result of friction that has
existed in the bank directory for near
ly a year, and the meeting that was
held to-day was called for the specific
purpose of removing Mr. Morris.
A* soon as Mr. Morris received his
notice as a stockholder announcing
that the meeting was called for the
purpose of removing him as a director
he issued a circular to the stockhold
er*, in which he made charges of forg
ery against one of the officers of the
bank, though he.mentionad no names.
This circular caused the trouble and
brought the carefully guarded friction
to light. The circular read:

1016 Broadway. Dec. 22.
The rolice have begun to gather evi
dence ujion which to enforce the order
of Mayor Warren Olney concerning the
removal of all street and sidewalk ob-
Etructions in the shape of advertising
eigns, bill boartds, bicycle racks and the
like that blockage the thoroughfares of
It is intended to cause the offending
obstructions to be removed by mer
chants and others, -without prosecu
tion, if possible. Mayor Olney says he
appreciates that there will be some ex
pense attached to the enforcement of
the t-iffn order, but he is satisfied that
in the long run the reform will find
unanimous support.
To facilitate the carrying out of the
order, the police are collecting facts
touching the character of the signs,
both as to those . that are on
the sidewalks or are suspended from
buildings. The intention is to order the
removal of all projecting boards or
other devices that might be construed
as obstructions or a menace to the pub
lic.
Chief Hodgkins detailed policemen to
day to measure signs of the character
to which objection will be made after
the holidays, wh"n the police have been
instructed to begin the sign crusade.
Mayor Olney has given notice two
weeks in advance that merchants shall
have ample time in which to meet the
conditions voluntarily. Along the same
lines it is. understood that more strict
enforcement of municipal ordinances
touching the use of sidewalks for mer
(handise storage will be Invoked. The
Mayor said he was strongly impressed
with the fact that the city requires
many minor reforms along this line in
keeping with the rapid growth and
steady increase in population.
Street Inspector W. W. Blair. has
been directed by Mayor Olney to notify
every person whose signs might be

This caused no end of trouble, but
when the meeting was held this after
noon the stockholders voted for the re
moval of Morris. Each side haying
fired one shot they are now waiting for
the next move.
Though no names, are mentioned in
the circular it is supposed that the
man referred to is W. G. Palmanteer,
vice president and general manager of
the bank, but this Morris will not say.
After the meeting Morris declined to
talk, on the ground that he would not
be accused of trying to injure the bank
through publicity. He said:
â¢'I have nothing to say except that I
was removed from office to-day. I ex
pected that. I must refuse to talk, be
cause if any injury results to'the bank
from this I am not going to be charged
with it."
General Manager Palmanteer was
equally uncommunicative. Baying:
"What goes on in a bank is the affair
of the stockholders, not ofÂ« the public.
Mr. Morris is no longer connected with
the directory of the bank. The reasons
for this are ' known to the stockhold
ers."
SAYS PRISONS
ASSIST CRIME
Commissioner Fitzgerald of
the State Board Deems
Present System a Poor One
ALAMEDA, Dec. 22.â Robert M. Fitz
gerald, president of the State Board of
Prison Commissioners, characterizes
the two penitentiaries of California un
der their present management as "uni
versities for education in crime" and
entirely Inadequate as means of at
taining the ends for which they were
instituted. He also asserted that he
was in favor of some system that
would prevent confirmed criminals
from propagating their own kind, as he
believed that most of the lawless taint
In convicts was directly heredltaryT
Mr. Fitzgerald expressed these views
in a talk on "Prison Reform" made be
fore the Unitarian Club last night. Con
tinuing he said:
California's State prisons to-day axe noth
ing short of a disgrace to the commonwealth.
The same methods are in vogue as were used
on prison boats fllty years ajro. Under present
conditions physical punishment is the only
way to reach certain criminals and enforce
prUon discipline. At San Quentin If one
man refuses to work in tbe Jute, mill *800
other convicts watch to see whether he or
the officials will triumph. If the unruly pris
oner wins there is a revolt. He feels that he
Is regarded as a hero by his fellow convicts
and there are prisoners who would rather
die than submit to discipline that would
lewer them in the estimation of their fellows
But there is nothing heroic in beins con
fined In a straltjacket. It Is more of a
mental than a physical torture and a man
could live Indefinitely In one. In the European
prisons each convict is by himself and when
he revolts against his work none of the other
convicts knows of it. There is -no heroism
about it and no general revolt. We want an
appropriation to build an additional prison
at Folsom, so that we can segregate the crim
it-als. If we were able to take a certain 6
per cent from among the others the remainder
could bevcontrolled as easily as children. I
think that much of the opium traffic at the
piieons is due to the small salary paid the
guards â $50 a month and found. When they
have an opportunity of making Â»everal hundred
dollars a month, as some of them have done
their $50 stipend looks meager and they cannot
resist the temptation to break the rules and
gather 1n the extra cash.

VICTORY FOR
CONTRA COSTA
Judge Ellsworth Intimates
Water Company Is Entitled
to Nonsuit Niehaus Bros.
ASK $146,000 DAMAGES
Berkeley Millmen Would Ee
cover for the Loss of Mill
"That Was Not Protected
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec/ 22.
According to the Intimation given by
Judge Ellsworth this evening, he does
not think that a water company is re
sponsible for a loss by fire on account
of a lack of water in the pipes. He
has given Attorney W. S. Goodfellow
until December 30 to find any-authority
that will change his view on this sub
ject, but as the matter now stands he
says that he believes that the Contra
Costa Water Company is entitled to"a
nonsuit in* the; action brought against
It by the Niehaus Brothers Company
of Berkeley for $146,000 damages.
There Is no California decision bear
ing directly upon. the point, but after
an entire day of argument by Attor
neys Samuel Knight ana M. C. Chap
man Judge Ellsworth declared that he
did not think that a water company
could be held blamable If the water was
being used to such an extent that there
was no force at the hydrants. .. While
he admits that' the Niehaus Brothers
â were paying for fire protection and had
seven hydrants in different parts of
their mill which was destroyed, he does
not think this such a contract that the
company can be held, liable ,for the lack
of pressure or for. any" more water than
the system can ordinarily supply.
It is the contention of the. plaintiffs
that having collected the money at so
much a hydrant for fire protection, the
company was responsible when the pro
tection was not there when , needed.

basis, the Health Department has Is
sued a statement showing the mortal

at population." This rate is so far below
that of three other large cities of Cali

the lead from a hygienic standpoint.
Comparisons as to 'death rates are
made by the Health Department 'as fol

Oakland, 11.44; Sacramento, 16.60; Los
Angeles, 16.78; San Francisco, 20.15.
The estimates of population upon

Attentions Said to Have Been
Paid to Mrs. Bertha Gris
more the Cause of Trouble
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Dec. 22.
' : Mrs. Bertha Grismore, residing at 608
Twenty-third avenue, was haled before
Police Judge Mortimer Smith to-day to
-answer to a charge that she had
threatened to ' kill Mrs. Louisa Lind,
1*216 East Sixteenth street, on sight.
There is a man in the case, according
to Mrs. Lind. who objected, shelnslsts,
to. the attentions that Mrs. Grismore
was . receiving from L. Thomas, the
complainant's brother-in-law.
Some time ago the Grlsmores, the
.Linda* and the Thomases occupied the
same residence. Mrs. Llnd announced
strenuously that she would not permit
Mrs. Grismore to make goo-goo eyes at
her '.brother-in-law. The quarrel that
followed caused a breaking up of the
hitherto amiable relations. .Soon after
the separation It came to Mrs. Llnd's
ears that Mrs. Grismore had threat
ened "to â  kill that Swede woman on
sight." ,
"That Swede woman" repaired .to
Prosecuting Attorney Leach and nar
rated her troubles.
"L can't speak very, good English,"
she declared, "but I can tell when love
making is going en, without looking in
a dictionary for the clew." â¢
Mrs. Grismore was given a week by
Juds;e Smith in which to consider the
situation with a view possibly to the
withdrawal of , any harsh words she
might have spoken concerning her for

SAYS HUSBAND
IS GUILTLESS
Wife of "Doctor; William
Proctor Kef uses to Credit
Story of His Wrongdoing
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
101C Broadway, Dec. 22.
"Doctor" William Proctor, accused of
obtaining money and jewelry from
aged Mrs. Emily Tyson of Niles, after
promising to marry her, and Ray
Ashberry, who is charged with being
an accomplice ' of Proctor, were taken
to Centerville to-day, and their pre
liminary examination will be held at
that place to-morrow before Judge
S. Sandholdt.
Just before the prisoners were taken
from the County Jail the wife of the
"doctor" called, at the jail to see him.
From her It was learned that Ash
berry is a stepson of Proctor, be
ing her own son by a former mar
riage. Mrs. Proctor refused to give
any information concerning the accus
ed men, and said that she had come to
Oakland with her husband about
three months ago. In discussing the
charges against her husband, Mrs.
Proctor said:
I do not believe a word of this story about
my husband's promising to marry this Mrs
Tyson. Why, such a thing is ridiculous. I
neve too much faith in my husband to doubt
him for a moment. He has always been
good to me, and I know that he would never
do such a thins as this. We have two chil
dren and I am sure that my husband thinks
too much of them to do any such thine as
these people say.
Ray Ashberry Is my son by a former mar
riage and I am sure he would not be a Dartv
ta anythine like this. P 7
Mrs. Proctor refused to give her ad
dress liÂ« Oakland, and after leaving the
Jail she called upon Tom Bradley, her
husband's attorney.
When the case was palled before
Judge Sandholdt .-this morning the ac
cused men made no statement and
asked that the case be set for hearing
as soon as possible. - As they could not
furnish ball, they were placed in jail
at Niles. v. .-
PRINCE FUSHIMI RESTS
QUIETLY AT HIS HOTEL
Abandons Trip to Monterey, biit May
Yet Decide to Pay Visit to
Stanford University.
Apparently . Prince Fushiml of
Japan finds San Francisco sufficiently
interesting to keep his mind busy un
til, he is ready to leave for his native
land. Yesterday he suddenly decided
to abandon his proposed trip to Mon
terey, where he had contemplated to
spend several days. The distinguished
visitor remained th e greater part of
the day in his apartments at the St
Francis, where he excused himself to
several | callers on the plea of needing
rest.
It is possible, however, that the
Prince may yet decide <to make a
short trip into the country, for last
evening President Jbrdan of the Stan
ford .University sent the Mikado's rel
ative an invitation to visit Palo Alto
some day -during the coming week.
As the Japanese have always evinced
a great deal of Interest In the univer
sity and sent a number of their young
countrymen there to receive a finish
ing education. It is thought that
Prince Fushiml; in recognition of
these facts, may find Jime to accept
President Jordan's Invitation.

EXHIBIT WORK
OF REAL MERIT
By Zoe Green Radcliffe.
OAKLAND. DÂ«e. 22.â Little Miss Scnrock
was a very happy little maiden last night. Her
birthday party yesterday was a delightful suc
cess, and every one cf her friends had renum
bered thâ¬ occasion with a gift, books, bits of
silverware, exquisite flowers, dozens of dainty
things. dear to the heart of the little 12-year
old. . â  . .
Much ol the afternoon's success was due to
the tact and graciousness of the little hostess
herself, as she possesses that rare quality of
% being everywhere at once and allowing no guest
to feel neglected for a moment. Over a hun
dred little girls enjoyed the, day yesterday, and
there will be little else talked of until the
Christinas tr*Â« obscures everything of lesser
momtot. | A really good vaudeville programme
was participated -In by a dozen or more tal
ented misses and everv number deserves special
mention, but limited Vpaee forbids. . â¢
The chief-' feature of the programme, of
course, was the play, and not only the chil
dren present but the older people were de
lighted with the cleverness of the young per
formers. Adele Scott as the Irish woman, dis
played a real wit in her conception of the part,
and the little hostess, in the role of a "school
ma'am." was equally good. Tha entire pro
gramme was as follows: Etta Schrock, recita
tion. "Sandy's Romance"; Helen Mehrmann.
song. "Violets"; . Ethel Carroll, piano solo;
Beulah Hutchlngs. song and danc*. "Teasing";

A number not on thÂ« programme was con
tributed by AÂ«a V, Mendenhall. who, being
called upon for a speech, gave a comic recita
tion- that made him the "lion" for the rest
of. the afternoon. Dancing and a delicious

vases that are well worth Inspection. The
most ' striking thing he has had on exhibition
for some time, however, la the lanre painting
by John M. Gamble, which he is now showing.
It Is a bit of Kern County, the hills In the
foreground covered with wild heliotrope. The

Another notable work that Mr. Rabjohn .Is
also showing Is a canvas by Edwin Deakln. It
presents to the beholder a new view of the
famous old Santa Barbara mission. The
old waterways, as historic as the mission and
their luined structures as artistic, are ad
mirably wrought in the foreground. The bell
towers of the ancient convent stand out con
spicuusly against a pale evening sky, while
a fog bank just rolling In envelops part of
the picture In a contrasting misty haze.

Special Dispatch to Tbe Call.
CHICAGO, Dec 22. â Fewer young
men are entering the ministry each
year. In thirty of the more important
theological schools of the North therÂ«
were enrolled, In 1894, 2500 students.
In 1903-4, the same schools registered
2133, a decrease of 3 S3. or 15 per cent.
Dr. William R. Harper, president of
the University of Chicago, gives thess
figures In the current Issue of tha
World.
There are a number of causes for this
decrease, he says. The principal on*
Is that the ministry has been brought
into disrepute in certain denominations
by youns men being admitted to its
ranks without adequate preparations.
"The dignity of the office," he says,
"has been greatly injured in this way.
"A minister is no longer the one per
son in the community who stands high
above others, and who, for that reason,
if for no other, commands the esteem
and respect of all.
"In old days, when home religious
influence was strong, father and
mother not infrequently set aside for
the ministry their first-born son. This
was regarded as a sacred duty. It is.
unfortunately, true that in few^of our
homes of the present generation Is the
influence of this religious spirit so
strongly felt, while in all probability
a great majority of our homes exhibit
a total lack of it."

scribed by her and witnessed by Douglas S. Watson and Arthur B. Watson? :_..! 'Sl:.l
Jurors Agree That
Testatrix Was
Competent
MISS WARREN WINS
Schander to Appeal
From Order of
Probate.
McENERNEY'S PLEA
It twk the Jury just fourteen minutes
to leave the box and return with a
unanimous verdict for tne proponents
la the Dolbeer will contest. The cis
posIUon thst Bertha Marion D->!b*Â«?r
n.3d* cf h^r estate is to be carried out
ir thÂ«? Probate Court. t-T the jurors ce
<~Iarrd her to have been of noun 1 mind
v. h-n t-he executed 1't-r testament. Mies
Etta Warren is to recÂ«ve betv.-f^n
SS30.000 and JSOO.OOO out of an estate
valued approximately at f 1,100.009. and
Miss Doibeer's wiÂ«h, often expressed,
that the woman who nac Deen mother
to her should always be w3ll provided
for. is to be fulfilled.
Adolph Schander. the uncle of tne
testatrix, eayg he has not Etf*<3 up the
f.gb^. Hie 'attorneys yesterday after
noon filed retire cf appeal to the Su
preme Court from the ortivr admitting
the will to probate, whicli v/as made
by Judge Coffey as soon as the jury
hud rendered its decision. He expects
to tie up the estate for a long period
at ary rate ar.d believes that he has a
chance of winning the case ultimately
on testimony that Judge Coffey is al
leced to have ruled outTerroneously. It
is generally believed that Schander's
purpose Is to force a compromise.
While temporary advantage an-3 de
lay may be gained by the contestant
through appeal and technical methods,
the proponents now feel that the attack
on the wi!l is virtually ended. The
fc-trer.gih of tne'r cas* as they wep able
to present it precludes success oL any
attack upon the testament. It was
demonstrated that tne case of the con
testant was correspondingly aeak. for
not in one material point could he find
anything vulnerable in the document in
which Bertha Dolbeer wrote away the
tartttot she inherited from her father.
A gracious conjpHirsect was pail to
Kirarn Johns^-n when it was said that
the chief element the proponents I-flvJ
to ccmbat in the trial was h'.s keen
tbility to make so much out of his case.
SWEPT AWAY ALL DOUBT.
Garret tV. McEnerney is regarded as
having swept all contrary opinion away
when in his argument hÂ«* so clearly
showed how reasonable was the motive
for Miss Dolbeer to bestow her bounty
on Miss Warren. It was s. signal stroke
when he culled the transcripts and re
pealed the statements that Â£Â«statrix
had rr.ade to a dozen or -nor? witnesses
concerning her d&ep feelings of affec
tion and gratitude toward Miss "Wr.r
ren. At various times, sjins back as
far as the death of her father in 1902.
Miss Dolbeer was shown to have ex
pressed tbe purpose -of se*la^ to it
"that auntie should always be well
ired for." The review of thes-? Ftate
: lrnts by McEnerney bef .wo the jury is
â¢ eemed to have clinched hiÂ« case be
: end peradventure. for it destroyed the
mrctest question as to what prompted
Miss Dolbeer to ignore her nearest of
kin.
The verdict unquestionably meets
with general approval, and there is
reason to believe that had it been for
the contestant Judge Coffey would have
eet it aside. The basis of the contes
tant** case was the circumstance that >
Mrs. Dclbeer committed suicide In 1S73 j
ar.d that Miss Dolbeer inherited in- 1
sanity, which was aggravated by cir- j
cumsuinces in her life. But he failed!
to establish that the testatrix was at i
any time of unbaJanced mind. The j
only witness he 'had to this effect was!
Mrs. Elizabeth C- Phillips, and her tes- â¢
timeny Â«as nullified by proof of her I
efforts to force Miss to yield '
up a bonus of 115,000 by threatening to

Woman Sued for Breach
of Promise Settles Case
Out of .Court for $400
Special Disoatch to The Call
GOSHEX, Ind., Dec. 22.â For the first
time in the history of this State a
woman to-day was forced to pay for
having jilted a lover.
Mrs. Susannah Altland compromised
by the payment of ready cash the suit
for breach of promise brought against
her by Ephraim Bickel. Mrs. Altland
paid $400 to the plaintiff through her at
torney and the incident was formally
declared closed.
â¢ Both of the persons most interested
declared their. complete satisfaction in
this, the latest turn in the case. Bickel
won the promise of Mrs. Altland's hand
in marriage, but a New York travelius
man won Mrs. Altland. hand and all.
Then Bickel's ardent love turned to
hate that sizzled. Finally he tiled Etiit
for damaged heart and life through
breach of promise. .' X;
Blckel Is a native of Arkansis and!
Mrs. Altland lives in Elkhart County,'
this State. She evidently faired thi
man or the outcome, for she preferred
that the suit should not come to trial!
Hence the dismissal of the case to -day.

A GOOD NAME
Governor-Elect of 3Iissouri
Witness in Suit to Cancel
$200,000 Insurance Policy
ST. LOUIS, Dec. 22.â Governor-elect
'Joseph Folk was the first witness to
day in'the hearing of the suit of a New
York life Insurance company to cancel
the $200,000 policy on the life of the late
James L. Blair. vi ?-
Witness said he knew Blair, who
was a leader at the bar, and declared
that no man had higher standing as a
citizen before reports began to circu
late about him. He told of the efforts
of Blair and John D. Johnson to raise
funds for the unearthing of frauds in
the election of April, 1901. Witness
never saw the original subscription
lists circulated by Blair, but said he
turned over $6000.-
Folk said he first heard rumors about
Blair In September. 1903. and had an
assistant fnvestigate to learn if they
were well enough founded to Justify a
Grand Jury ' Inquiry. Continuing he
said: , v^l
After a newspaper had made reference to
tha fact that the Grand Jury mi*ht take up
the raae. Blair called on roe. He said he had
heard the Grand Jury might take up the mat
ter asd he waÂ« da.i of it. He said It bad
preyed on his mini for a long time. He cald
he had a brother who was very wild and who
had elven him trouble fcr a Ions time. This
brother. Blair said, had forzed some docu
mentsâdeeds, I believe, he slid â and that -he
had kept the matter quiet out of consideration
for their mother. 60. years. old. . Now, he said.
hÂ« was satisfied for the truth to be known and
said he would . render me any asgi* tance he
could. He eent me the name of a Mr. Robert.
r 1 told Mr. Blair that the Grand Jury's In
vestigation, â would bÂ« thorough and that. If
the evidence I showed It ought to be done he
would be Indicted. Blair replied that hÂ« ex
pected no favors.
Andrew J. O'Connor, a title examiner,
testified that he had been unable to
find any'reebfd of a large number of
deeds of trust, all of which the plain
tiff company charges were forged by
Blair. -

&Â»<rf*l Dispatch to The Call
STOCKTON, Dec 22.â A legal action
that involves a remarkable mistake
made many years ago was begun
"Wednesday. All that appears of record
is that Public Administrator J. S.
Moulton has applied for letters of ad
ministration on the estate of Edward
â William Underdown, who died between
1S64 and 1STO leaving an estate consist
ing of the north half of the southeast
quarter of section 33, township 3 north,
range 9 east.
Some time before his death Under
down sold his land to persons residing
In this count:' whose names are for
the present withheld, but in making out
the deeds a mistake was made in de
scribing the land so that the deed pur
ports to convey a piece of land in the
opposite end of the county from the
piece intended. The mistake was not
discovered until a few months ago. Un
derdown died leaving no estate and no
relatives. The persons who had unwit
tingly received a . deed to the wrong
piece of land were worried. Underdown
had left no kin whom they could sue
to quiet title. They were in possession
of the rieht land, but their title was
defective. Attorney R. C. Minor was
appealed to and he evolved the scheme
of having the Public Administrator se
cure letters of administration on Un
derdown's estate valued at nothing
for the purpose of haying this official
act as the defendant in a friendly suit,
which will now be brought to quiet
title.

CHICAGO. Dec. 22. â Dr. L. C. H. E.
Zelgler, in the Probate Court, to-day
filed a bill of particulars In connec
tion with a bill of claims filed two
weeks ago against the estate of the
late Mrs. Harriet G. McVicker, who
died recently in California, Mrs. Mc-
Vicker was the widow of the widely
known theatrical manager, J. H. Mc-
Vicker. Zeigler's claim In full
amounts to $ 126,000. The bill just
filed includes copies of contracts,
which Zelgler claims existed between
himself and Mrs. McVicker. The bill
shows two contracts bearing on the
$100,000 wh>ch Zeigler asserts Is due
him as part of his claims against the
estate.
The first contract is dated December
19. 1899, and provides that after the
death of Mrs. McVicker the sum
of $100,000 shall be paid to Dr. Zeig
ler as soon after the demise as pas
sible. This money, according to the
contract, was to be given for services
as medical adviser. The second con
tract is practically a duplicate of the
first one, the exception being a change
in signature from "Mrs. J. H. McVlck
er" to "Mrs. Harriet G. McVlcker.**
The reason given for the change in
signature was a desire to avoid a pos
sible legal technicality. The contract
includes the following information:
That the party of the first part. Mr*. Har
riet G. McVlcker. beinx aware that tesne un
scrupulous persons have conspired to ruin tba
doctor's reputation and business, willingly and
unhesitatingly caoses this chance of signa

STILL HARPING.
T-'HE South has so long stood in its own light and has tried to
Â«j injure itself by chasing after bad money and bad politics that
its real friends in the North hoped it would- take counsel of
wisdom since the election and adopt a sane and sensible course.
It is evident, however, that this cannot be done until a new and bet- i
tcr sentiment calls for new and better leaders. Here and there may
be found evidences of good sense in the South, but they are timidly
and apologetically offered, while Tillman, Vardaman and the un
speakable fool sent to Congress from Alabama remain the real
heroes of Dixie.
It was not always so. When the South had Bayard, Carlisle and
Lamar as leaders there grew up a sound public sentiment, worthy
Â« >f respect and with which the North was at one. This disappeared
when Tillman capered into the ring, a mixture of clown and des
perado, and it has not come back. This is why there is a solid
Xorth at last facing a solid South. This will be as long as the South
uses its political power in a way that threatens the welfare of the
nation. The South took up free silver and unsound currency, and
\inder the leadership of Mr. Bryan alarmed the country as much as
it could have been alarmed by war. In three national elections $hc
people have condemned bad money by a constantly increasing ma
jority. The verdict has an emphasis that only the silly or the dis
honest can misunderstand. The North repudiated free silver in
;8q6; in 1900 by a still larger majority it repudiated free silver and
greenbacks combined, and in 1904, lest its position seem in doubt,
.1 solid Xorth repudiated the party "which did not "Hare say that it
was for the gold standard and sound money. The North desired to
clean up that issue and to wipÂ« out the party that raised it, and it
<lid ho by a majority of more than two and. a half millions.
One would think that would settle it, and that the South would
return to the sound money ideas of which Lamar, Carlisle and Bayard
were the ablest advocates. But Dixie is joined to her idols. The
leading Southern statesman just now is Mr. John Sharp Williams of
Mississippi, leader of the minority in the House. True, he has '^ot a
very laborious job, and it will be less in the next House, but still he is
the leader and speaks by authority. He assumes, to make issues
for the future and to plan battles to come. In his latest effort to
that end he harped on the money issue, declaring there is "an influ
ence at work to displace Government provided money by bank pro
vided money, in order to enable the banks to make a profit."
This utterance is in that cryptogram so dear to Southern states
manship, in which meaning is clouded in distorted and deformed
phrase. What Mr. Williams means is that the retirement of green
backs is contemplated and that their place will be taken by national
bank currency. From the form of his utterance it is plain that he
cither thinks, or wishes to be understood as thinking, that the Gov
ernment provides money for the people free, that for greenbacks
they will not have to give anything, but for national bank notes
they will have to put up collateral.
This is financial heresy and folly in the most acute form. It
harks away back to the time when the primitive greenbackers
claimed that it was the duty^of the Government to print and give
freely to every citizen as much paper currency as he wanted. This
was the "more and fittener currency" advocated by Calamity Weller
of Iowa, and it h the financial plan supported by General Weaver, to
whom the Greenbackers gave a considerable vote for President. It
is in finance the companion of a flat world, around which the sun
revolves. It is as discredited as witchcraft and alchemy. Yet the
leader of the Democracy of the Union proclaims it. There is no
hope for a party under such leadership. It shows profound darkness
of mind in regard to Northern sentiment and knowledge, and in
some of its aspects it is pitiful..
But this crude and ignorant conception of a currency is not the
only mistake the/ South makes about the North. At the recent meet
ing of the Southern Society in New York, Colonel Bingham of
Xorth Carolina was an oratorical guest. After breathing" a fervent
prayer that the South would always remain solid, he proceeded to
discuss the negro question. He said: "After all the world has
found that he is still a negro, and it grieves me in a way to see
some of our Northern friends forced to put the negro on political and
social equality and occasionally as a superior." Now as long as the
South has representative -fools of that stripe there is no hope.
Throughout the South an ignorant and provincial people are told by
such men as Bingham that in the North "the nigger is on top," and
this is <lone to keep the South solid. It is a false appeal to prejudice
to keep enlightenment from reaching the daricplaces. It is a pre
paration of that people to accept the financial ideas of Mr. Williams.
If it were possible for these to become the financial policy of the
Government, those very people would be the first and greatest suf
ferers, but they â¢vould never trace their losses and crosses to their
true source, but would accept the explanation of their leaders that
"the Xorth" was to blame.
Let us give credit for one flash of light at the dinner darkened by
Colonel Bingham. Dr. Alderman, president of the University of Vir
ginia, speaking on "the supreme need of the South," said: "The
quality of the Southern leadership is weak, and the crying need is
for trained men. For their training great institutions of learning
are necessary, and for them there should be great endowments."
Bingham got the applause and Dr. Alderman got cold silence,
but he talked sense, while Bingham talked sectional rot. Which idea
will the future South follow? Will we see there, endowed by the
abundant wealth of that (Section, the rise of great institutions of
learning like Harvard, Yale and Stanford? Will we see among the
young whites an industrial training equal to that which Booker
Washington is giving to the young blacks? Will we see a weak
and demagogic leadership give way to one patriotic and strong? It
is well to hope, but hard to hope, with Williams and Bingham get
ting the applause and Alderman the cold shoulder.
THE STATE'S SCHOOLS.
rpHE twenty-first biennial report of the Superintendent of Public
j Instruction for the State, which has just been issued; contains
material of interest to every taxpayer who cares to follow the
course into which some of his money is devoted to the training of
the young in this commonwealth. Complete in every detail of sta
tistical summary and adequate comment upon the various educa
tional activities in which the State has an interest, the present re
port serves also to show the high mark of efficiency which public
instruction has attained in California.
Superintendent Thomas J. Kirk, in his message of transmission
to the Governor, has to report satisfactory conditions in every de
partment of our public school system from the university down to
the elementary schools in the country districts. In all five of the
State normal schools an increased attendance, despite the higher
standards of admission requirements, marks the prosecution of the
work in training teachers. The California Polytechnic, School at San
Luis Obispo, which has only been open for instruction for a year
and may still be considered to be-in the experimental stage, will find,
according to Superintendent Kirk, a large place in the educational
scheme of the State. * . v
Upon one issue the Superintendent makes strong recommenda
tions; that is in the matter of teachers' salaries. He calls attention
to the fact that though the State tax of $7 per census child designed

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL; FRIDAY, DECEMBER 23, 1904.
WHEN CUPID
PERCHED.
BY RUBY DOUGLAS.
, ,/AN your left you see the
I I home of the latC Cornelius
\^y Vanderbllt," bawled the
man through his mega
phone, as the big electric coach rolled
up Fifth avenue.
Like an awkward squad obeying
"left dress" the occupants of the sight
seeing coach turned^in the direction
("Won't you exchange seats witll I
me?" [
of the great red mansion. Suppressed
expressions of awe were clearly de
picted on their faces.
Georgina Winterton, perched on the
end of the back seat, smothered a
laugh and prayed t that the man
would not relate the story of the late
owner's life.
A young man, clearly impressed by
Gt-orgina's prettiness and the natty
fashion In which she carried her blue
serge suit, swore softly to himself at
the appearance of a few flakes of snow
on his coat. He was afraid they would
multiply and drive the very attractive
young person below with her fellow
women passengers.
"Before you, behold Central Park,"
the guide yelled, impressed with his
own importance In imparting such a
startling piece of information.
â  "No one would ever have guessed
It," commented Georglna mentally,
tying her veil more closely about her
face. The wind was turning chilly. .
One by one- the women sought the
inner recesses of the coach until
Georgina was the only girl on top.
Secretly the man beside her admired
her pluck in braving the now fast
falling snowflakes. He fancied she
must be from the West, where a snow
storm is a common occurrence, de
serving no notice.
"The zoo," called the man with the
megaphone, pointing to the section of
the park inhabited by animals, birds
and water fowl.
An energetic little flurry of wind and
snow blew the ends of Georgina's veil
across the young man's face.
"Oh, I beg your pardon!" apolo
gized Georgina with a dazzling smile.
"My veil wants to interfere with your
sightseeeing." ,
"Don't apologize; but won't you ex
change seats with me? It is not so
windy here on the fciside," he said, ris
ing and proffering a steadying hand.
"Thank you," Georglna replied, mak
ing the change with a frank smile of
relief.
Through the megaphone the man was
imparting wonderful bits of informa
tion abuut the nark. He told them
everything they had known for years,
things they had learned In their geog
raphies at schocrl and things that had
been told them by every one who had
ever visited the city. When they came
to anything really interesting the man
was silent, saving up his breath for
the next world-renowned object for in
spection.
Miss Georgina was wondering if the
young man was properly impressed by
the sights. The young man was specu
lating as to whether she was highly
entertained by the valuable information
bawled from the horn. Finally a nega
tive answer to his soliloquy came to
him intuitively.
"You know this park is right in the
center of the island," he said. â¢ *
"Yes," Georgina was politely
ested. .
"It seems truly wonderful to think of
all this greenness â it's green in sum
mer, you know," laughed the 'man, not
ing his own brilliant statement, "in the
heart of so great a city as New York."
Georgina feigned enlightenment.
"Oh, do you live here?" she asked,
appeasing her conscience with the be
lief that sight-seeing gave certain priv
ileges among fellow tourists. It was
for their mutual education that they
were conversing.
"Noâ Pittsburgâ but I've been here
often before. My sister went to school
back there on Fifth avenue at Mrs.
Finishem's." â¢
"Oh, no! So did I! Whatâ" Geor
gina hesitated. She had been about to

Bockerâ It hardly whispers to me.
ask him the name of his sister and that
âwell, that was equivalent tQ asking
for his" own name. Even a> mutual
sight-seeing expedition would not ex
cuse that.
The man observed her hesitation and
misconstrued her meaning. Perhaps she
did not want to know his name.
"You might have known Bess," he
said tactfully. Without directly ask
ing her, he had thrown out a lead
which she could follow if she chose.
"Bess Burruss?" asked Georgina, un
able to suppress her delight at having
found the brother of the girl whose ad
dress she had been wanting for days.
â¢â¢The same.V replied the man.
"Oh, I know a man who is dread;
fully in love with her and she would
not promise to write to him, believing
he was a â oh, a man who said pret
tily polite things to every girl and
that he did not mean them at all."
"Ah â ha! I believe my sister had
some love making sprinkled in with
her educational retouching," laughed
the man.
Now, how was he going to find out
her name* Perhaps his sister "had
spoken to her â but no. surely he
would have felt a thrill had she done
so? Surely he would have felt the
proximity of his fate. How he loved
snowstorms and sight-seeing parties!
How jolly grateful he was for three
hours to kill before taking his train
for Pittsburg. He had happened
along by the Flatiron building just in
time for the sight-seeing coach to
suggest itself as a time killer.
They had forgotten all about the
man with the megaphone.
"Youâ you are visiting here?"
asked the man.
"Oh, I live in the city!" Georgina
watched the interrogation mark plant
itself In the man's eyes. Why was
she on a sight-seeing coach if she
lived here? But he said not a word.
' "I just came out for a lark." said
the girl. "I haVe often wondered what
it .was like when I've watched these
cars roll along, filled with open
mouthed strangers."
"Was I open-mouthed?" asked the
man.
"I'm Just killing time till train
time." he said.
"And you'll remember me to your
sister when you get there." Georglna
suggested, with mischief in her eyes.
Just remind her of the girl whom
I met on the touring coach?" he
laughed. ."She'll know definitely who
you are," he added, with good hu
mored sarcasm. ',

"Isn't he a wonder?" asked Georg
ina, seizing the opportunity to beg his
question.
"Perhaps he isn't lonely in his won
derfulness " said the man briefly.
Georglna 1 * looked at'him.^ "Xo? Well
I m Georgina Claire Wintertpnâ
Georgie for. short. Let me impress up
on you the fate that at Mrs. Finishem's
school we did not learn to talk to
strange men on sight-seeing coaches in
snowstorms, butâ"
"But what?"

face and I had to apologize andâ thenâ

returns from the megaphone andâ well

Any one who wishes to may get out

But Georglna and Bess Burruss'
brother were drifting.
"And I shall certainly tell her that

"My cousin, Jack Clayton."
"That Mr. Clayton never says pret
ty things unless he means them."
"Thanksâ that's v^ry- good of you.

"Oh, I sayâ we've got Wall street and

"I wasn't after sightsâ just a new

skirts in her hand. The big sight

granite mansion.

STAMP OF THE MASSES
ON FACES YOU SEE
IN A CROWD.
By Dorothy pcQimore.
DO you ever think to study the faces
in the crowd as you walk idly
"along? If not, I promise you
'twill be well worth your trou
ble to do so now and then.
Possibly if you were to see many of
the faces outlined singly by artist's
brush or pencil their insignificance
would most impress you; but here in
the crowd they are" part of the great
humanity; they have the dignity, not of
the individual, but of the mass of a
mighty tide.
And on a wiptry day when the rain
is falling heavily, the faces in the
crowd are still a sea, but now a sea
at play. There is a brightness, a light
ness, about them, yet a hint of power
beneath, that reminds one of the sun
touched gayety of a crested wave.
Often when I am walking through
the crowded city streets I watch for
signs .Â«Â¥ love upon the faces of peo
ple who pass by. Unless you have
tried this yourself you would never
believe how full of love this hard and
bitter city is which daily grinds to dust
beneath its ever-turning wheel the
dreams of thousands of its men and
women.
The faces in the crowd are not neces
sarily happy ones, except where here
and there a girl and boy are smiling so
radiantly that they. put. the sun to
shame. For the most part they are se
rious. But the lines that .time has
written on them are tender rather than
hard, as one might expect; and the soul
which shines out through their eyes is
usually luminousÂ»with kindliness.
. It is Interesting to pick out one after
another the different types of lovers.
They are of all ages, and of all condi
tions of men.
Look at the little tots, still clinging
to their mothers' skirtsâ with what
frank interest the little boys turn to
look after the little girls â with what
naivete the little girls, hanging shyly
back, gaze after the little boys.
lads and lasses as they pass size up
each other's attractions with a curious
mixture of boldness and modesty in
their demeanor.
But the sweethearts going in couples
hold one's attention longest. Seeâ is
not the love light in that young girl's
eyes, as she looks up into her compan
ion's face, like a holy flame? And there
are married lovers toiling along, weary
with care, but llghthearted because of
each other's companionship and be
cause of the boys and girls at home for
whom they are buying Christmas pres
ents.
Occasionally one sees in "the crowd an
old face, one beautiful with age, and
spreading from . its sincerity and gen
tleness a benediction oh the world
around.
When I look upon the faces in the
crowd, so earnest, so helpful, so sober
toward the present, so hopeful of
heaven, I cannot but feel that George
Herbert was right In calling love a
personal debt. All our lives long we
should count over the blessings of love
and pay for them in the coin of charac
ter.-AH oar life long we should appre
ciate our debt.

ARCHITECT ADVISES
AGAINST HASTE IN THE
LIBRARY SITE MATTER
Editor The Call: As an architect fa
miliar with the situation regarding the
library site and in close touch witn
the plan making on Twin Peaks, fier
mtt me a few words.
Mr. Burnham, in spite" of all to the
contrary, has so far approved a "civic
center" of : definite location and size,
and on' this he has indicated the - li
brary on block 66, although block 67 Is
equally suitable. Furthermore, . so far,
he has approved the panhandle exten
sion. But these -plans are in- a sense
preliminary. One by one 'all possible
plans are being exploited and -when all
possibilities have been exhausted Mr.
Burnham himself, after most; careful
consideration, will select the most prac
ticable apart from all "personal or spe
cial interests. "â¢' Â» "".. "
' To ';â  those who argue that the "civic
center" may be changed or never real
ized it can.be answered that the pan
handle extension may also run on other
lines .than byv block 73â indeed a better
graded 'and much less expensive route
from" the City Hall . to the McKinley
Monument has already. been indicated.'
Hence, while the matter is in gesta
tion- any -premature action would be
supremely unwise. None of the blocks
bo far offered are entirely bonded and
all of them will : stay where they are

YULETIDE MUSIC
FOR THE CHURCHES
kCAT CHOIRS WILL
T>nce more the season has come round ,
when the clergy and the organists and .
choirs* of the city are found hard at
work arranging and perfecting their
programmes for the. fitting celebration
of Christmas within the sacred walls.
Of all the religious music composed
by old and modern masters the finest,
the most elaborate and descriptive will !
find its place in the beautiful services !
that will draw thousands to the various f
places of worship on Sunday, both |
morning and evening.
In harmony with all these glorious
sounds will be the floral decorations :
within chancel and sanctuary rails, j
Altars will bear a profusion of chaste ;
lilies, and festoons of rich greenery !
will twine around massive beams and j
hang from great chandeliers. All these ;
will form a suitable frame In which i
the devout will worship 'and listen to j
the beautiful strains from organ and J
from voice. "Peace to all men" will be j
chanted, will be preached, may be â¢
heeded. It will be the theme of the day |
everywhere and Its echoes along the !
year to come will be prayed for.
The country Is at peace with all the j
world, the nation is at peace with her- j
self, prosperity marks her condition, [
the people are thankful for all the j
manifold advantages which it is their j
lot to enjoy. The clergy of all denom- ;
{nations admit that the spiritual out- â 
look Is ever brightening. Therefore will j
the great choirs and worshipers with |
good reason give voice to their thank- j
fulness in sacred melodies which will j
eound the truest of harmony on Christ- â 
mas day.

BATTLING NELSON AND JIMMY GARDNER MAY FIGHT IN JANUARY
CLAUDE DEFEATS MARTINMAS
Many-Time Derby Winner
Has XotJForgotten How
to Sprint.
Â»
STILICHO A WINNER
Five Public Choices Get
Home in Front at Oak
land Track.
B0KGHES1 A WARM ONE
BY FRED K. MULHOLLAXD.
If given the opportunity Claude
could probably be^i Big Dutch, Gov
ernor Thomas, Pat Tucker and all
the balance of the Oregon short liners
any distance from three panels down
to the length of a clay pipe stem, for
M:k>> Daly has transformed his many
time Derby winner Into an out and
out sprinter. The bay horse started
in a eix-furlong purse number at Oak
land yesterday and. with Willie Daly
in the saddle, had the pleasure of de
lÂ«*ating two such fapable pieces of
racing hardware a:- Charley Hen
snail's Martinmas and IridiuÂ«, the lat
ter from the Jennings stable. Willie
Daly is not as clever as Johnny, for
he can lose ground where his elder
brother would save it. However, he
â¢lid vÂ«ell yesterday.
Quoted at 9 to 5 once during the
letting. Claude closed a 3 to 2 favor
ite. Martinmas and Iridius shaped out
all the early pace and it was not un
til a furlong from home that Claude
Cot up to them. Once on even terms
the favorite gradually forged ahead,
leading Martinmas out a neck in 1.13.
Iridius as usual weakened, though
running a creditable third. The other
starters were outclassed.
FIVE FAVORITES SCORE.
It was a day when the ring was
called upon to stand some punish
ment, for five straight favorites
marched down the line before a break
occurred. The climatic conditions
were favorable and there was a large
crowd in attendance.
Toupee, a fair sort of plater on the
Xew York tracks, took the opening
sprint from a bunch of cheap ones.
The iittle Tenny gelding looked in a.
soft spot and from threes his odds
were hammered down to 9 to 5 fa
voritism. Sam Greenfield had him in
front before the stretch was reached
and he blew in an easy winner over
the 30 to 1 Fhot, Flo Manola. Box
Elder, a 50 to 1 chance, finished in
the show.
In previous races David Boland waa
never without a dazzling assortment of
speed, and with the distance sawed off
to five furlongs, the two-year-old
scramble fitted him like a brand
new overcoat. In the betting, David
ruled abc-r equal favorite with
The Reprobate. Ridden by Frank
Reed, he outfooted Princess Zula,
a 20 to 1 outsider, beating the
filly less than a length. M. A. Powell
ran a close third, after being cut off
once on the far turn by the winner.
The Reprobate sulked after Davis drew
the whip on him.
BORGIIESI A SURPRISE.
A seven-furlong purse event for
maidens was responsible for one of the
warmest tips of the season. Moormead
Farm sent a good looking brown colt
by Brutus-Ledette called Borghesi to
the post. When the bookmakers
chalked 6 to 1 against his name. It
looked as if the association would have
to resort to the riot call. At 8 to 5 con
siderable money was taken by the* lay
ers, and this finally gave way to evens.
The green hand at the game had Jakle
Jones on his back and. while he did not
run like a â¢â phenom," everybody* got in
lina after the race, and that is suf
ficient. The good thing early headed
Emma Reubold and at the wire won
ridden out from Darksome and Sunny
Shore, steuning the seven furlongs in
1:28. Silicate displayed considerable
speed to the stretch.
Garnet Ferguson's gelding Stilicho
finally found a location that suited him,
annexing the mile and fifty-yard sell
ing fixture without half trying. He
was, nicely handled by Davis and, a 9
to 10 favorite, led Scherzo by the Judges
more than two lengths. The old cam
paigner Barrack, sporting the colors of
the young Chicago turfman, Tony Bar
rett, finished a becoming third. Flaunt
ran disappointingly.
G. W. TRAIIERN FINISHES FIRST.
If Travers made any mistakes with
G. W. Trahern In a race decided last
Saturday, which was won by Flying
Torpedo, he corrected his faults in the
last event yesterday by placing the
Summers' horse over the plate first.
He not only beat Flying Torpedo the
length of a Nevada stock train, but
also subdued Byronerdale, probably
the best of the middle-class selling
platers. Of course, it may be that G.
W. Trahern is a horse that requires
weight to keep him balanced on an
even keel, for in yesterday's essay he
picked up five pounds more than in
his preceding parody. There are no
apologies to make for Byronerdale.
He got away well and Davis had him
on the rail throughout. The last eighth
of a mile Travers, on G. W. Trahern.
passed him like throwing a plug hat

TRACK NOTES. /
Vickery was suspended for an aggra
vated case of inanition, which attack
ed him while piloting Introductor in
the third event. His exhibition was
lurid and wonderful.
Royalty gave his stable connections
an awful jarring. They were all down
hook, line and sinker on the bay geld
ing, and his ghastly showing is puz
zling them still.
Charles Boots of Elmwood Farm will
race some of his stable at the Los An
geles meeting. .
Arthur* Redfern, the noted Eastern
rider, IfÂ» in town. He is here on a
business trip.
Toupee was brought to California by
Announcer Bob McGibben and was
sold at public auction.
Walter Jennings is in Los Angeles
on a short visit, and may secure the
services of "Big Bill" Knapp for his
stable.
Solomon Bonner would be quite- an
addition to the stock of riding talent.
Bonner's riding, however, is restricted
to the stable of C. C. McCafferty by a
ruling of the stewards.
Claude was jumped on during some
stage of the race in which he was re
turned winner/ and one leg was con
siderably bruised. It is not thought,
however, that, the injury will prevent
him from being a starter In the-Christ

BLUE AND GOLD ELEVEN
MAY PLAY IN NEW YORK
A Game Is Said to Be Practically As-
sured Between Columbia and
University of California.
NEW YORK, Dec. 22.â A football
game between Columbia and the Uni
versity of California is practically as
sured for next season.
According to present arrangements
the big contest will be' played in New
York after the Columbia-Cornell game
on Thanksgiving day. The game has
long been wished for by Columbia stu
dents, but owing to the long schedule
of the "Westerners no game between the
East and the West has hitherto been
possible. The Columbia coach, Morley,
tried last year to arrange a game, to
be played in California. The Western
manager, however, sent word that his
programme was full and negotiations
fell through. /
One of the athletic directors at' Co
lumbia stated \o-day that the ' game
will be brought about through the ef
forts of former Captain Smith of Co
lumbia. The latter has just been ap
pointed head coach of the University of
California.
Smith has . taken up his residence in
the West and henceforth will devote
his attention to th^e football interests of
Westerners.
While at Morningside Heights Smith
figured as one of the most prominent
players in the East. During his last
year at college he played at fullback
and was captain, of the eleven. After
graduation he went West and assumed
the position of coach for the University
of Oregon.

Choices Are Unfortunate
LO^ ANGELES^Dec. 22.â Rain upset
the calculations of the form students at
Ascot to-day and only one favorite on
the card was successful. The other five
races ur.nt to well played horses at lfb
erar odds, the longest chances being
Cincinnatus at 8 and Effervescence at
10 to 1. Bluecoat, McLaughlin's two
year-old, was backed heavily on his
Eastern performances and iwon the
second race at four and a half fur
longs in a canter. Belle Kinney was
second and Fireball third. Tramotor,
the favorite, was a bad fourth.
Bragg scored another victory by win
ning the fourth race, a free handicap at
one mile, in the easiest sort of fashion,
with Sheriff Bell second and Tim Payne
third. Bragg was favorite, in the bet
ting from start to finish. Cincinnatus
furnished a. surprise in the fifth race
and won from The Major and Blissful
in the order named. McGrathiana
Prince was a 3 to 5 favorite for this
race, but was never a serious con
tender. Cincinnatus could be had at 10
to 1.
The sixth race witnessed the down
fall of another favorite and the success
of a 10 to 1 chance. Effervescence won
handily from Susie Christian and Nan
on in the order named. Winnifreda
was a redhot favorite and Red Damsel
was also heavily played, but neither of
them liked the heavy % going.

JANUARY PERMIT OUT
Alex. Greggains Will Lead
Off the New Year With
the Best Available Card
Matchmaker Alex. Greggains of the
San Francisco Athletic Club drew two
Christmas packages yesterday at a
meeting of the Supervisors police com
mittee. He was granted a permit for a
professional boxing contest and one for
an amateur exhibition, both to be held
in January.
He began looking about for a suitable
card and decided if Jimmy Gardner and
Battling Nelson could agree upon the
question of weight they would be a
good attraction. Although Nelson had
weighty matters on his mind regarding
the disappearance of his manager. Ted
dy Murphy, he told Greggains he would
light Gardner at 133 pounds ringside.
Gardner's representative said the
Lowell boxer would agree to make 133
pounds at 3 o'clock. Gardner Is at
present in Butte. It is expected some
understanding will be reached to-day.
ifoung Corbett is anxious to fight
Britt in January. The Callfornlan de
clines to discuss a fight until after the
holidays.
Jack Johnson Is willing to fight Mar
vin Hart next month. Kid . McCoy is
also anxious for a match with Hart.
Of the two it is thought Johnson would
be the greater attraction, as McCoy is
supposed to have seen his best days.
The officials of the Colma Club came
out of retirement yesterday and offered
a $10,000 purse or 70 per cent of the gate
receipts for a fight between Britt and
Nelson. They also agreed to secure an
â¢outside referee, Mentioning George
Siler of Chicago, Harry Sharpe, former
ly of St. Louis or Charley Eyten of Los
AngelesT*
a he fact that a committee of the Su
pervisors granted a fight permit for
January indicates that there is no se
rious intention of stopping the game

CITY OFFICER
SENT TO JAIL
Detective and Three More
Denver Election Officers
Found Guilty of Contempt
PEIOIITTED REPEATING
Applications of Nineteen
Men for Leave to Apply
for Discharge Are Denied
DENVER, Colo., Dec, 22.â City De
tective William H. Green, John de
Saye, Frank McMahon and Robert
Goodman were to-day adjudged guilty
of contempt by the Supreme Court for
their work In precinct 3. Fourth Ward,
this city, at the late election, and were
each sentenced to serve six months in
jail and to pay $100 fine and costs. The
court announced that the evidenca
showed that De Saye, who was an
election judge, permitted repeating and
that the other three assisted in the ir
regularities.
Expert examination of the ballots
from this precinct revealed 256 fraudu
lent votes and the Democratic heading
on 223 was written by one person. The
handwriting on these, according to the
experts, is the game as on fraudulent
ballots found in other ballot boxes.
There are now in Ja!I twenty-seven
men who have been convicted of con
tempt of court In committing election
frauds, and who probably will be prose
cuted later on criminal charges.
The Supreme Court to-day denied to
nineteen of the men sentenced to jail
for contempt the right to file petitions
for discharge and have the court act on
them as if they had been filed at the
time their cases were being heard. This,
it is said by lawyers, -will be one tech
nicality in the way of an appeal to the
United States Supreme Court in the
cases of these men if that tribunal
should take up the election cases.
Warrants for five men who served as
officials of election in Precinct 13,
Ward 4, were issued, but only
one, Clarence P. Dixon, could be locat
ed and served. Those not yet served
are Thomas O'Connor, J. W. O'Connor,
F. R. Brown and Thomas J. McCart
ney.
James W. Campbell, William Dougall
and George Kern, who served as judges
or clerks in Precinct 7 of Ward 5, were
arrested to-day on the charge of con
tempt- They gave the usual bond and
were released.

DIPHTHERIA AXTI-TOXIXE
I*rogress of an Attack of Spotted
Fever Stayetl by an Injection
of the Remedy.
BRISTOL, Conn.. Dee. 22.â The
first practical test of the theory re
cently advanced by Dr. Wolff of Hart
fcrd,. a bacteriological expert, whose
experiments^ would indicate a definite
relation between diphtheria and cere
bro spinal meningitis, or spotted fever,
is being made at Forestville, near
here.
A young girl was taken sick yester
day with {spotted fever and the disease
progressed so rapidly that when a
physician arrived he considered the
case almost hopeless. As a last resort
6000 units of diphtheria anti-toxine
were administered, with the result
that the patient was much improved
to-day and there is thought to be good
prospect of recovery. There* have
bec-n twelve deaths from the disease
hfre in as many weeks.

FOGS MAY LAST
ANOTHER DAY
Dense Haze Still Hovers
Over United Kingdom With
No Signs of Its Lifting
TRAFFIC IS PARALYZED
All Trains Are Many Hours
Late, Trading Impossible
and Chaos Reigns Supreme
LONDON, Dec. 23.â There is as yet
no sign of the lifting of the fog which
envelops the kingdom. The absence of
wind throughout Great Britain is al
most unprecedented and meteorologists
do nut expect any change in conditions
for another twenty-four hours.
Considering the almost insuperable
difficulties attending locomotion of any
form, the number of fatal accidents
haa been remarkably smalL The con
gestion and suspension of business are
very general. So far as London is con
cerned the tuba railways are the only
concerns benefiting, and their daily
traffic is reaching record figures. Places
of amusement are almost deserted and
shopkeepers are loudly lamenting the
absence of the usual Christmas oustom
ers, instead of which the big stores are
inundated with orders by post, which
cannot be executed, owing to the com
plete dislocation of all carrying busi
ness. Railroad traffic, both for long
and short distances, is almost par
alyzed.
A condition . resembling chaos pre
vails in the postal service. With the
continued accumulation of Christmas
parcels and letter traffic it is quite im
possible to preserve even a semblance
of punctuality. AH railway trains are
many hours late, and many trains be
tween London and the suburbs occupy
a couple of hours in making a distance
of eight miles.
Mail boats in all directions are simi
larly disorganized. The Oceanic and
Saxonla have been unable to reach the
landings at Liverpool. The Cedric and
Pretoria, outward bound, are both de
layed and the Minnehaha is waiting at
the mouth of the Thames, unable to
proceed. , ;
Only two vessels enteredthe port of
London yesterday, a condition of affairs
euch as has not occurred for twenty
years. The mouth of the river la
crammed with vessels loaded with per
ishable food stuffs of all descriptions.
The streets of London present remark
able scenes. Nothing is visible except
ing buoy torches and the occasional
flare of big creosote lights which the
authorities are beginning to employ to
assist traffic. Nearly everybody is suf
fering from headache which the doctors
attribute to the fog. ,
At Birmingham Sir . Oliver Lodge is
making experiments with a model elec
trical apparatus for the dispersal of fog
which, although successful, is regard
ed as being too expensive for applica
tion on a large scale.

be in a position to dictate the policy of
the club in futtfre.
"We thought it only right to place
Mr. Corrigan in a' position to control
affairs," said Brown, '^'in view of the
fact that he has taken'* a personal in
terest in our fight against the Western
Jockey Club. He will have all to do
with the appointment of officials and
with the arrangement of the details of
the meeting, which we will give later
on." 'â  â .; \ '-,'.

TWO CHADWICKS
ARE INDICTED
Cleveland Grand Jury Ee
turns True Bills Against
Woman and Her Husband
ACCUSED OF FORGERY
Information Charges Couple
With Uttering" a Paper
â¢Bearing Carnegie's Name
CLEVELAND, Ohio, Dec. 22.â Dr.
Leroy S. Chadwick and his wife, Mrs!
Cassle L. Chadwick, were jointly in
dicted by the county Grand Jury this
afternoon on the charge of having
forged and uttered a J5.000.000 note
signed "Andrew Carnegie." Dr. Chad
wick is now on his way to New York
from Paris and' is expected to land next
Wednesday. As soon as the indictment
was returned Sheriff Bary of this coun
ty made arrangements to secure Dr.
Chadwick's extradition. He will meet
the steamer on its arrival.
This is the third time that Mrs.
Chadwick has been indicted by the
county Grand Jury, but it is the first
instance of her husband's name ap
pearing in legal proceedings in the
case. The indictments already return
ed against Mrs. Chadwick are similar
to the one voted to-day except that
they cover notes of $250,000 and $500,000
signed "Andrew Carnegie."
"There are many things which Dr.
Chadwick will have to explain and I
hope' he will do so," said Prosecutor
Keeler this afternoon. "Dr. and Mrs.
Chadwick may be tried on the indict
ment, separately or together. Each has
a right to trial singly if it is desired.
The jurors will finish their work Satur
day. The Chadwick investigation so
far as this jury is concerned Is ended,
but I cannot say that this concludes
our Inquiry into the matter. It Is pos
sible that there may be other develop
ments."
BOSTON, Dec. 22.â On behalf of Her
bert D. Newton, it was authoritatively
stated to-night, civil proceedings would
be instituted against Dr. Leroy S.
Chadwick upon the latter's return to
this country. The action will be
brought for the recovery of a paper
given by Chadwick to Newton, and
having a face value of $90,000.

action. Later in the day the declirie in that '
Oelivery became quite pronounced and in con- <
sequence distant futures were materially af
fected. Reclizing sales by pit traders sent
the price of May.down to $1 11 ?4- Argentine
exports fcr the Vcek were estimated bv a '
British crop expert at 1.2CO.00O bushels, and ]
as the previous week's shipments were 8tj4,O0O j

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEATâ There was not much change any
'where yesterday â here, in the East or in Eu
rope. The local market continues to Jiang are.
like the weather, and the holiday season tends
to keep thing? very dull.
The Grain Exchange yesterday voted to ad
3ourn from Friday afternoon to Tuesday morn
ing, over Christmas.
The Portland Oregonian says: ' 'Eastern
shipment to date has aggregated about 15,000.
000 bushels, while only fl.5CO.0C0 bushels have
been exported by water. Exporters believe
that when the ships now in port under charter
are dispatched the grain shipping year will
practically come to a close. It is figured that
only 3.O00.0C0 to 5,000,000 bushels of Wheat
remained unsold In the Northwest, and thi*
quantity will probably find its way to the
Eastern States. '

THETONOPAH MINING EXCHANGE
STATES FACTS
u I li I lu I no I iJi
Pursuant to a resolution passed by the San Francisco and Tonopah Mining
Exchange in an executive session Saturday, December the 17th. the following
statement is given oat for publication:
Xo consolidation of the San Francisco and Tonopah Mining. Exchange and
the San Francisco Stock and Exchange Board has been effected, nor Is such a-
move contemplated.
gBUjT When the public began to realize that Tonopah ar.d vicinity was a *rÂ»at
mining region and that the stocks listed on the San Francisco and / Tonopali
Mining Exchange were good, safe investments the business of this board became
quite lively. This excited the jealousy of the Comstock brokers, whose business
was overshadowed and cut into by the dealings in the Tonopah and GoldSelo
stocks.
, The Comstock brokers first made a proposition to consolidate the two boardi.
but this did not meet with the approval of the Tonopah brokers far several rea-
sons, the principal one of which was the great difference in the nature of the se-
curities dealt in on 'the two boards. â¢
The Comstock shares are all assessable, and there are many mines on their
list that have not been worked for twenty years and no one expects them to
work again; in fact, the value of no stock on the Comstock list depends on thÂ«
merit of the'mine, but on the manipulation of the stock. In contrast to this
assessment mill and stock manipulation, the Tonopah stocks are non-assessable,
and if the mine or prospect has no merit the stock has no value.
In "plain English." the Comstocks are gambles and the Tonopahi arÂ» invest-
ments and legitimate speculations.
When consolidation was refused, fifteen of the members of the Tonopah
Board decided to join the Comstock Exchange. After belnjf elected members of
the Comstock Exchange and trying to do business under the methods followed
by the Comstock brokers, they asked that the Tonopah Exchange ' take them
back in a body and stated that their reason for wanting to coaie back was that
they were unable to do a legitimate business tn Tonopah stocks under the meth-
ods prevailing on the Comstock Exchange.
â¢ Seven of the Vonopah brokers, who had paid $200.00 each .for their Â«Â«ats on
the Comstock Board, were so glad to get back into the Tonopah Exchange that
they willingly sacrificed their $1400.00.
The San Francisco and Tonopah Exchange tas continued to do a good, legit-
imate business in the stocks on its list at its board rooms in the Mills building,
and will continue to do so. MEg
j Notwithstanding the treachery of ipe or two former members of the Tonopah
Exchange and the jealousy of the Comstock brokers, the San Francisco and
Tonopah Exchange has a larger and stronger membership than at any time in its
h " tory ' H. C. CUTTING.
B5i President of the San Francisco nr.d Tonopah Mining Exchange.

FIERCELY WAGE
WAR OF WORDS
Personalities Fly Between
Attorneys Dunne and Ko
walsky in Sloss' Court
NO DAMAGE IS INFLICTED
Bplli<rerent Lawyer Accuses
Rival of Trying to Kob
Widow of His Dead Friend
Attorneys EL I. Kowaleky and P. F.
Dunne engaged in a sharp exchange
of j>erEonaiities in Judge Sloss* Court
yesterday. Honors were even when
the court intervened and put a stop to
the war of words.
The trouble started over the attempt
of Kowalsky to introduce certain evi
dence in the trial of the suit of T. J.
Ryan, administrator of the ' estate of
the late Senator Maloney against the
widow, Delia J. Mahoney.
Dunne declared that Kowalsky
was offering that kind of testimony
"in order to rob the widow of his dead
friend." ' Kowalsky then unloosed his
wrath. He said that Dunne was try
ing to run the whole case and the
court. He declared that his adversary
was so vain that he carried his own
picture in his vest pocket, that he
might admire it. After several ex
changes of like import hostilities
closed. When the evidence was all in
Kowalsky said he wanted the argu
ments heard next week, so he could
be present, because, . in his absence,
"Dunne's courage would rise like a
thermometer on a hot day." Dunne
eagerly told the colonel that he want
ed him there.
The trial of the case has been an
echo of the Blythe will contest. In
1S92 Florence Blythe Hinckley made
a contract with Kowalsky to pay him
2 per cent of all that he won for her.
Kowal?ky made a contract with Sen
ator Mahoney to' pay him 10 per cent
of the 2 per cent for services ren
dered in the case. When the settle
ment was made' Mrs. Hinckley gave
Mahoney her note for $5500. Mrs.
Mahoney alleges that the Senator gave
her the note: the other heirs say he
did not, and have sued for its recov
ery. Colonel Kowalsky intervened In
the suit between the Mahoneys and
said the note was his, because Ma
honey had not rendered the services.
The arguments will be heard Tuesday.

MRS. MONROE
SALISBURY DIES
AT THE PALACE
Mrs. Monroe Salisbury, for years a
recognized leader of society in San
Francisco, passed away at her apart
ments in the Palace Hotel late last
night. An affliction of the heart wai
the direct cause of death, although
Mrs. Salisbury had been ill for many
months. Her death came rather sud
denly and her large circle of friends
will be greatly shocked at the sad news.
Mrs. Salisbury was alone in her
apartments when she was stricken. Her
nurse had gone on an errand and when
she returned, Mrs. Salisbury was
breathing her last. Death came a few
minutes alterward. Her husband, who
is at present at his Pleasanton ranch,
was notified, as were her two daugh
ters, Mrs. T. Danforth Boardman and
Mrs. Alexander Keys, and her son,
Sydney Salisbury. Xo arrangements
have as yet been made for the funeral.
Mrs. Salisbury has been a leading
figure in the social world here for many
years and her influence was felt by the
exclusive set more than that of any
other woman of her time. She was a
born organizer and social dictator, as
well as a woman of great talent and
culture; hence her will was often the
law of society.
Mrs. Salisbury came of a good old
Kentucky family and was a pro
nounced Southern woman in every
sense of the word. She was born in
Galveston, Tex., January 27, 1847. When
still a child she was brought to Califor
nia by her father, T. P. Robinson. Her
girlhood was spent in Sacramento,
where he was a leading lawyer at that
time, being a member of the noted law
firm of Robinson & Haggin.
The family moved to this city soon
after the daughter reached womanhood.
She at once began to attract attention
by her beauty, as well as her social
charms. She was married to Monroe
Salisbury In 1874 and the wedding was
a great social event, as both bride and
groc-m were at that time entering upon
their careers as leaders in the gay life.
Three children were born to the cou
ple â Kate, Margaret and Sydney Salis
bury. Both the daughters are now
married and occupy positions of promi
nence in society. Mrs. Salisbury also
reared her niece, Miss Mary Mercado,
now the wife of Chauncey Boardman.
Mrs. Salisbury's mother was Mary
Crittenden. a noted belle of the blue
grass State. Mrs. Salisbury was relat
ed to the Tevis family, the Breckin
ridges, Marshalls and Prestons. She
was very proud of her family connec
tions and every time she wenjt East was
received with open arms by society
leaders there. Her fame was national
and she was recognized as a woman of
social importance from ocean to ocean.
In appearance Mrs. Salisbury was
tall and slender with dark ,hair and
e>es. Her features were clear cut and
her appearance at once bespoke the
woman* of character and determination.
Although more than fifty years oki at
the time of death she still retained
much of her personal attractiveness
and socially was very active until re
cently.

homestead. She is the widow of Dr.
Mariano E. Gonzalez, who provided
in his will that she should receive a
third of the revenue of the ranch as
long as she remained unmarried. An
other third goes to the daughter,
Anita, and a third to the forty minor
grandchildren of Francisco Rico, de
ceased half-brother of Gonzalez. In
addition about $70,000 worth of real
estate and personal property was
plsced In a trust, the income to be
paid to the daughter. Mrs. Gonzalez's
attorney, Charles S. Wheeler, contend
ed that this was a great injustice to
tho widow, who had given fifteen years
of her life to the deceased. If the
income from the 575,000 worth of
property were divided as a contribu
tion from the Rico heirs it would
amount, said the attorney, to only $5
a month from each, and it was from
their share that this support was in
right demanded.
Reuben H. Lloyd, attorney for the
administrator. Mayor Robert F. John
son of Monterey, said - that' he . had
done his duty in presenting all the
facts to the court and believed that
the widow was entitled to a home
stead, it resting in the court's discre
tion as^to how much land she should
be given. Judge Charles W. Slack, on
behalf* of the daughter, and T. J.
Geary Jr.. for the Rico heirs, opposed
the application.

ROOF REPAIR ORDINANCE
Supervisors' Committee Recommends
Passage of Measure Requiring Use
of Fireproof Materials.
The Joint Supervisors Judiciary and
Fire Committee yesterday, sitting In
session with Mayor Schmltz, recom
mended the passage of the proposed
ordinance prescribing a limit within
which roofs destroyed entirely by fire
shall be repaired with fireproof ma
terial only. The Mayor expressed
himself In favor of the measure in
view of the fact that the Fire Depart
ment officials favored it. The or
dinance will go Into effect on May !â¢
1905. -J^ -â ' #-VT ;
Emll Pohll, representing the Lum
bermen's. Association, argued that the
ordinance was unnecessary and that
the most destructive fires had oc
curred in the fire limits. He said the
measure would work a hardship on
small, property owners in the outly
ing districts.
Captain John H. Nelson stated to
the committee that if the ordinance
was passed it would give a black eye
to the redwood industry of this State.
He said that redwood was really the
most- fireproof of all woods and could
be made more so by artificial means.
. W. H. Newell said that the output
of -redwood shingles yearly was 600.
000.000 and it would not be Just for
the board to pass a measure that
would hurt any home manufacture.
Several insurance men reiterated
their statements made at former ses
sions to show that the ordinance was
necessary for better fire protection.
