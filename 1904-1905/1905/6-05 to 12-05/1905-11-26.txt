I Â»fT*^HE chore part must lie entirely
* â¢ I with j-ou, sir," said Captain
I Kettle. "It's mixed-" up with
I the foreign enlistment act and
, : the Alabama case, and a dozen
other things which may mean anything
between jail and confiscation, and my
head Isn't big enough to hold it. If
you'll bÂ«; advised by me, Â»ir, you'll see
a real first-clans solicitor and stand him
a drink and pay him down what he asks
right there en the bar counter and get
to know exactly how the law of this
business stands before you stir foot In It.
"The law here in England," said the
little men with a reminiscent sigh, "is a
beastly thing to lall foul of; It's just
â¢wickedly officioue and Interfering; it's
never done kicking you. once its got a
.fair start, and you never know where it
will shove out its ugly hoof from next.
No. Mr. Gedge, give me the States for
nice, ccmforiable lav/, .where a man can
buy ,it by the yard for paper money
down, and straight pistol shooting is al
ways remembered in his favor."
The young man who' owned the steam
ship Suitan of Borneo tapped his blotting
paper impatiently. "Stick to the point.
Kettle. We're In England now and have
nothing whatever to do with legal mat
ters in America. As for your advice,
1 am not a foci; you can lay your ticket
on it I know to an inch how I stand. And
I may tell you this: the shipment is ar
ranged for."
*Td like to seÂ« us cic-ared," said /Cap
tain Kettle, doubtfully.
"No cue will Interfere with the clear
ance. The Sultan of Borneo will leave
here in co;.l, consigned to Havana. A
private yacht will meet her at sea, and
transship the arms out of sight of land."
"Tyne ccal for Cuba? They'd get their
coal there from Norfolk, Va.. or else
Welsh steam coal from Cardiff or New-
port."
"It *ecms not. This contract was
placed long before, a ship was asked for
to smuggle .out the arms."
"Will, it louks fishy, anyway."
"I can't help that," said Gedge irrita
bly. "I'm telling you the naked truth,
and if truth, as usual, looks unlikely,
it's not my fault. Now have you got
mi'jnwo objections to make?"
"No. "sir." sai<T Captain Kettle, "none
that I can see at present."
"Vei-y well, then." said Gedge. "Do you
care to sign oh as master for that cruise,
or are you going to cry oSC?"
"They'll hang me if I'm caught," said
Kettle.
"Not they. They'll only talk big. and
the British Consul will set you clear. You
bet they daren't hang an Englishman for
mere crougslixis U< Cuba. And, besides,
ain't 1 offering to raise your screw from
twelve pound a month to fourteen so as
to cover the risk?' However, you won't
get caught. You'll find everything ready
fcr you; you'll slip the rilUs ashore;
and then you'll steam on to Havana and
discharge your coal In the ordinary
humdrum way of business, and there's
a ten-pound bonus If you pull the thins
off successfully. Now, then, .captain,
<iuickâ you go or you don't?".
"I iio," said Kettle, sioomlly. '"l'm a
poor man. with a wife and family, Mr.
Uedge, and 1 can't afford to lose a berth.
But it's that coal I can't swallow. I quite
believe what you say. about the contract;
cniy It dotsn't look natural. And it's my
belief the coal will trip us up somewhete
before we've done, asd bring about
trouble"."
"Which of course you are quite a
stranger to?" said Gedge slyly.
"Don't taunt me with' it, sir," said Cap
tain Kettle. "I quite well know the kind
of a brute 1 am; trouble with a crew
or any other act of living men at sea is
just aieat and drink to me, and I'm bit
terhv ashamed of the taste. Every time
1 idt underneath our minister in the
chapel here in South Shields I grow more
ashamed. And If you heard , the beauti
ful poetical way that man talks of peace
and green fields, and golden harps, you'd
undirfclaiid.".
"Yes, y^," eaid GcQkc, "but 1 don't
trant any of your. 'excellent minister's ser
mons at second-hand just now. cuptain.
cr any of your own poetry, thanks. I'm
vrv busy. Good morning^ Hplp yourself
to a clear. You haul alongside the coal
ehoot? to get your cargo at 2 o'clock, and
I'll be on board to efe you at C. Good
mornine." And Mr. Gedge rang for the
olerk and was busily "dictating letters
before Kettle .was clear of the office.
The little sailor went down the grimy
stairs and into the street, and made to
ward' the smÂ«-lllrts Tyne. The black
cisar rested unlit in an angle of his
mouth, and he gnawed savapely'at the
butt with his eyeteeth. -He cursed the
fates as he walked. Why did they use
him so evilly that he was forced into
berths like these? As a bachelor, he
told himself with a sneer, he would have
jumped at tho excitement of it. - As the
partner of Mrs. j Kettle, and the father
of her children, he would have shud
dered when he threw .his eyes over the
future. . \u25a0 > â¢ -
â¢ For a week or so she dould draw his
Jhalf ; -pay and live sumptuously at" the
rate of sevenr pounds -a.monthl But
afterward, if he got caught by some
angry Spanish war steamer with the
\u25a0smuggled rifles under, "his -hatches, and
shot, or hanged, or imprisoned, or other
wise debarred frcra earnins an income at
his craft, where would Mrs. Kettle be
then? Would Gedge do anything for
her? He drew the clear from hl3 lips,
and iÂ»i>at contemptuously at the -bare
idea. With the morality of the affair
he troubled not one Jot. The . Spanish
Government and the Cuban rebels were
two rival firms who offered different rates
of freight according to the risk, and he
was emnloyed as carrier by those who
paid the higher price. If there was any
right or wrong about the question, it
was a purely oriva.te matter between Mr.
Gedge and his God. He. O Wen Kettle,
was as Impersonal In the business as the
ancient Sultan of Borneo hÂ£rself;_ he was
a mere cog in some complex- machinery;
and if he was earning heaven, it was
by piety ini;ide the chapel ashore, and
not by Drofessional exertions (in the In
terests cf an earthly Gmpioyer) else
where/
He took ferry across .the filthy . Tyne
and walked down alleys and ' squalid \u25a0
streets where coal. dust formed the mud
end the air v/as sour with foreign va
pors. Arid as he walked he champed
still at the unlit cigar and brooded over
the angularity of his fate. But when i
he passed between the gates of-the; dock
company's premises, and exchanged words
with the policeman on guard,* a change
came over him. . He threw away the
cigar stump, tightened his lips and left
all thoughts of personal: matters outside
the door sill. He was Mr. Gedge'B-hired
strvant; his brala was devoted -to fur
thering Gedge's interests, and all the
add of his tongue was ready -to spur on
those who did the manual work on
Gedge'3 thlp.
AVlthin a minute of his arrh'al on her
deck the SuJtan" of Borneo was - being
unmoored frctn the bollards on the, quay;
within ten, -her winches were clattering
and bucking .'as they warped < her across
to the black, sttaddling coal shoots at
the other side of the ' dock, â¢ and within
half an hour the cargo was roaring down
her hatches as fast as the railway wag
ens on the grimy trestle overhead could
disgorge.
- The " halo of coal dust made ! day into
dusk; the grit of it filled every cranny
and settled as an amorphous scum, on the,
water of the dock, and laborers hired. by
the hour toiled : at piecework \ pace
through sheer - terror at \u25a0 their employer.
If his other fallings could have been
eliminated this little skipper, with the
red peaked beard, ' would certainly .: have
been, from an owner's- point ..of view,
the best commander sailing \ out of any
English port. 'No man ever wrenched
*uch a magnificent amount of \u25a0 work
'from his hands. But it was those other
.failings which* kept him â¢> what he was,
the pitiful knockabout shipfnaster, ..' liv
ing from hand to 'mouth, never certain
of his berth from one month's end to
another.
That af ternocn Captain Kettle .; signed â¢
on his crew, got them on board, and with
the help of his . two mates . kicked ; the
majority of them Into sobriety. "He re^
cefveda visit and, final Instructions * from
Mr. v Gedge at 0. o'clock, and' by nightfall
he had ; filled in his \ papers. >. warped â¢ out
of dock, : and : stood . anxiously ':* on the
bridge watching the pilot as -he took the
stecmboat \ down,; through : the crowded
shipping of the river.. His .wife stood;
under the glow of an on the
dockhead and waved him good -b'y through
the gloom;- ' a:.
Captain Kettle received : his . first fright;
as he dropped % his pilot just outside the
Tyne pierheads. A ; man-of-war's launch,
steamed :up out of the night, and 'the
boarding officer examined; his ; papers 'a'nQ
asked questions. -The little captain,'; con
scious of having no contraband of war on
beard just then*, was brutally' rude, but
the naval officer remained stolid,, arid re
fused to see the , insults " which were
pitched at him. He had an unpa|atab!<>
duty to perform: he quite sympathized
with Kettle's feelings over the matter,
and he got back to his launch, thanking
many stars that the affair had ended so
easily. '- \u2666â¢
But Kettle rang: on his engines again
with very unpleasant feelings. It whs
clear to him that the secret was 0027
ingr out somewhere; that the Sultan of
Borneo was suspected; that his course
to' Cuba would be beset with -many,
well-armed obstacles, and lie forthwith
made his first ruse out of thelong'suc
eession which were to follow.
He had been instructed by,- Gedge to
steam off -straight. from, the Tyne to a
point' deep in the North 'Sea',' where a
yacht wouldjneet him to hand ovehthe
consignment of smuggled -arms. But
he' felt the ifilght to be full df eyes, and
fbr a Havana-bound ship toleave the
usual steam lane which leads to ; the
English Channel was equivalent to 1 a
confession of, her purpose, from the out
set. So he took tho parallel rulers'and
penciled oft on his chart,the stereo
typed course, which Just clears .Whltb,y
Rock and Flamboro Head; and the Sul
tan of Borneo -w.as held .steadily , along
this, steaming at her normal nine knots;
and.it was not till she was out of Bight
of land off Hurnber-mouth. and'the isea
chanced to be deaolate,\ that" he star
boarded his helm" and stood off for the
ocean rendezvous. . \ ,
A hand on'-the foretopsail yard picked
up the yacht out. of 'the; 'gray* I , mists '.of
dawn and by eight bells they were ly
ing: hove-to in the trough," 'with 100
yards of cold. gray water/ tumbling, be
tween them. /The -transshipment was
made in two lifeboats and .Kettle went
across and enjoyed an
breakfast in , the yacht's /cabin. ;The
talk. was all upon the Cuban revolution.
Carnforth, the yacht's owner,' brimmed
with it. : . .' '\u25a0 "\u25a0'\u25a0; ' . â¢'.'"â¢
"If ;you can run the rblockade," cap

be grateful enough. to vput up'a statue

,The voyage from that time onward was
for Captain , Kettle a : period: of constant
-watchfulness.^. It -would not; be true ta
say "that he 'never.; took , off 'â¢ his clothes
or VnÂ«ver; slept: but whether be was In

hind them.
So. although" this ail-natlon~crW pf theEultan of Borneo dreaded the Spaniards t
much, they feared Captain Kettle far I
more, and by the time the steamer had t
closed up with the Island of Cuba they t
had concluded to follow out their skip- s
per's 4 orders, as beir.g the least of the 1
two evils which lay before them. s
Carnforth's way of looking at the mat- i
ter was peculiar. He had all a healthy 1
man's appetite for adventure, and all a,
prosperous man's distaste for bflng 1
wrecked. He had a strong personal liking i
for the truculent little skipper, and. other i
things being equal, would have cheer
fully helped him; but. on the other hand. ;
hÂ« could not avoid seeing that It was to l
his own interests that the crew should ]
get their way and keep the steamer out j
of dangerous waters. And so, when finally ]
he decided to stand by non-lnterferent, he â¢ t
prided himself a good deal on his forbear- ,
ance. and said so to Kettle In as many ;
words. . i
That worthy mariner quite agreed }
with him. "It's the very best thing ]
you could do. sir." he answered. j*"lt '
would have annoyed me terribly ' to
have had to shoot you out of mischiefs i
way because you've been kind enough
to say you like my poetry and be
cause I've come to see, sir. you're a
gentleman."
They came to this arrangement on
the morning of the day they opened
out the secluded bay in the southern
Cuban shore, where the contraband of .
war was to be run. Kettle calculated
his whereabouts with niceness. and,
after the midday observation, lay the
steamer to for a couple of hours, and
himself supervised his engineers while
they gave a good overhaul to the ma
chinery. Then he gave her steam
again and made his landfall four hours
after the sunset.
They saw the coast first as a black
line running across the dim gray of
the night. It rose as they neared it,
and showed a crest fringed with trees
and a foot steeped in white mist,
out of which came the faint bellow of
surf. Captain- Kettle, after a cast or
two, picked up his marks and steamed
in confidently, with his sidelights
dowsed and three red lanterns in a
triangle at his foremast head. He was
feeling pleasantly surprise^ with the
easiness of it all.
But when the steamer had got well
into the bight of the bay and all the
glasses on the bridge were peering at
the shore in search of answering
lights, a blaze of radiance suddenly
flickered on to her from astern and
was as" suddenly eclipsed, leaving them
for a moment blinded by its dazzle. (
It wa3 a long truncheon of light which
WHY WE SHOULD FIGHT FOR PURE-FOOD LAWS
POWERFUL, forces are now being
drawn uo In battle army prepara
tory to the struggle that Is to ensue
over the effort to pass a pure^food
bill at the next session of Con
b-rtss. Silently, but effectively, are the
lines of battle being formed and the
shrewdly devised plans placed In execu
tion. This will be one of the bitterest
congressional contests ever waged In his
tory and one of the most universal con
cern. Billions of dollars of capital and
profits and the welfare of eighty millions
of people are the opposing Interests at
stake. " v
The battle Is over the right of manu
facturers to place adulterations In foods.
Investigation and reports from health of
ficers have proved that jthese adultera
tions are often extremely injurious to
health and many deaths have been
caused by them. The people, who have
chosen a Congress to represent them at
the nation's capital, want that Congress
to pass a law prohibiting the sale of
foods made injurious from adulteration,
decomposition or other cause of deteriora
tion. The manufacturers of adulterated
foods want the national Congress to de
feat any such measure that may be pro
posed, because they are now realizing
Jl.tfS.ooo.ooo annually from the sale of
these adulterationsâ this according to the
reported estimates of the Secretary of
Agriculture. < \ : -- V
The men engaged in the making of
epurious foods represent a greater wealth
than do the combined railroad and steam
ship interests of America. Few people
realize the enormous influence they, con
trol. They treble the profits they would
make from honest foods through the
system they bave of chemical treatments
and coloring, which enable them to make
factory refuse Into apparently pure foods;
to renovate and rehash old, decayed goods
into something entirely different from the
original and self them as fresh, whole
some products; to transform conglomerate
fruit pulp into Jellies and Jams bearing the
labels of fruits of which they may not
contain a particle; to chemically treat
meats, tinned goods, of all kinds, soda
fountain beverages, drugs, coffees, teas.
spices, wines, whiskies, beers and every
thing else we cat or drink so as to avoid
the expense of the legitimate process of
manufacture or of the purchase of gen
uine products and to give the consumer
fraudulent substitutes instead.
Through the use of these chemicals and
colorings they are enabled to make fabu
lous fortunes from products which other
wise'would'so to waste. The refuse of
th" factories, which they would have to
haul away to the garbage plants and pay
"o have destroyed under other conditions,
are now made into tempting looking foot!
products and named for fruits and meats
which actually form no part of their con
t*nts Costly plants have been installed
for the ourpose of making foods from this
reuse *The manufacturers contend that
ItVould work a great- commercial hard
chip on them to force them to discontinue
the practice after they have been at It
so long and after they have gone to such
great. expense to bring about this com
mercial economy."
The people" contend that the manufac
turer has no right to sell this factors
refuse for pure food products. ; especli Mlj

Carnfortti swore aloud Tand Captain
Kettle lit a fresh cigar/ . Those of the
mongrel crew who were "on the deck
went below to pack their.' bags.:
"Well, sir," said Kettle /cheerfully,
"here we "are. That's a^panish gun
boat with searchlight, aft complete"- â
he - screwed up his eyes and gazed
astern' meditatively. "She's got- the
heels of us, tooY by' about five knots I r
should say. Just look/at â¢ the flames

"What are you going to dor* asked
Carnforth. . " \u25a0</-â¢
"Follow out Mr. Gedge's instructions,
sir, and put this cargo on the beach.
Whether the old Sultan goes there, too,
remains to be seen.
."That gunboat will cut you off In a
quarter of an' hour If you keep on this
course.
"With the extra five knots she can
do as she likes with us, so I shia'n't
shift my, helm. It would only look
suspicious." '
"Good Lord!" said Carnforth, "as If
our being here at all isn't suspicion
itself."
But Kettle did not answer. He bad,
to use his own expression, "got his wlts>
working under forced draft," and: he
could hot afford time for idle specula
tion and chatter. It was the want ; ot
the answering signal ashore which up
set him. Had that showed against the
black background of hills': he would
have known what to do.
Meanwhile the Spanish warship was
closing .up with him hand over fist,"
and decision was necessary. Anyway
the choice was a poor one. If he sur
rendered he would be searched, arid
with that damning cargo of rifles and
machine guns and ammunition ;'. under
his hatches, It . was not 'at all:improb
able that his captors might string- him
up out of hand. They would have
right on their side for doing so.

seem that the manufacturer ought to be â¢
content with the profits he would make
without resorting to such base decep
tions. Every civilixed nation in the
world, excepting America, has a pure
food law.
It Is the great Injury to life and health
caused by these chemically preserved and
colored f ood 3 that make the people so
anxious for a law prohibiting their use.
They are the chief cause of nervousness,
having the same effect on the | nervous
system as opiates and other poisons; they
produce bowel trouble In children and
often cause their death; they cause Indi
gestion and kidney troubles and frequent
derangement of the liver. Equally Injuri
ous are decomposed and tainted foods
which are permitted on sale in many
towns and cities. Tons of these and
chemically treated foods , have been de
stroyed In Chicago since the beginning of
the pure food crusade by the new Health
Commissioner, Charles J. Whalen. Health
Officer Darlington of New York has de
stroyed as great amounts there. Decom
posed and Improperly kept foods are
more apt to produce quick death from
ptomaine poisoning. A law ought to pro
hibit their sale; and a dealer who sells
them should be j convicted as any other
criminal. Careful Inspection ought to be
made to prevent toad : stools being sold
for mushrooms and to guard other like
dangers. There Is scarcely any restraint
to the sale of any ; kind of : foods In the
United States now, save that imposed by
the State and city laws, and they are as
varied as ,they are numerous,* making a
maze of confusion that is bewildering to
the dealer, the manufacturer and the
public. ! .
Sudden deaths are often caused by the
different kinds of, Impure foods/but per
haps the greatest -harm is done by â those
containing just enough adulterants to
avoid Immediate 111 consequences. -These
are the kind that - undermine â¢ the ; health
of the - child and ' adult and cause : slow
death, which Is : generally attributed :to
some other cause. How ' many, deaths of
this kind occur can only be surmised, but
it would doubtless be ; appalling if the
truth were known. ]%MB$&&&1

Carnforth listened with staring eyes.
"What sort of broil was this truculent

knew enough of Spanish character to

In describing the crime of , adulterating
focds Mr. Bnan further says:
"I have "been deeply interested In the

Modern Sin/ he takes occasion to point
out that while our educated and well-to

such as burglary, assault and battery
and murder upon the highway, they are
guilty of modern sins that are no less In
jurious to their character, but sins which
aro committed without coming Into close

"Professor Ross spoke of an Instance
In Chicago where the Board of Health
sent out a - prescription to be filled at a

cases the prescription filled contained not

las Russti. once a prominent resident' of
this city* aud now working nisrht aÂ»d day
in fee Far Eaet to realize an -ambition
that he has tostertd for years, thus writes
to a fÂ«llo*- practitioner In lits former
i>lape of abode.
The news from St. Petersburg lately has
i rr Quentiy mentioned the . name of Rus
scl." It has told' of the secret issuance, of
his rropacandas that have kindled the
lire of hatred among his countrymen and
stirred them to revolutionary action.
First -he v.as skirting along the southern
borders of Russia. Next be was heard of
in Siberia. Pursued, he was compiled to
seek refuse l.n bapan. where wp. have
since learned of hfÂ»* work among the Rus
sian prisoners of war. who.. thirtS-thou

strated their sympathy for the revolu
tionists In Russia by singing the "Mar-:
.â¢-t.-il;iiihe" auu \va> ins rod banners bearing
the symbols of liberty, as they marched
through the detention camps.
Few of the readers of tbe dispatches
from the Far Ehsi have k probably recog
nized in this propapator of revolt the
same l)r. Nicholas Russel, a distinguished
and cultured oculist, who practiced for a
nuxnbcr of years jn this city, with his of
fices in the Phelan buildlns. and " was
for a time foremost In a local fight
against the Greco-Russian church, that
was productive of a nasty scandal and
resulted in the recall of Bishop Vladimir.
He had probably been' forgotten by all
but those with whom he continued to
correspond and those with whom he vas
engaged In the Greco-Russian church
controversy in the early '90s. Then as
now lie uas imbued with the bitterest ha
tred -or tbe Russian monarch and pub
licly displayed Ills feelings. He had been
forct-d to suffer some of the cruelties prac^
tlced by the Government upon its, s^ub
jocts and had finally fled to escape im
prisonment in the dreaded bastUe of. Tyu
men.
Dr. Rufscl is a nobleman by birth. ;t
fact he concealed after his arrival in S3l
Fr?.ncisÂ»co until the outbreak of thQ
troubles wltb the opposing faction in. the
Grcco-Russlan church, of which he was
at one time a member. He had been a
praduate of ' the University of li<Jff,
whtne as history has shown the student
body gradually abforbes thr. tlu-oiU.s of
the free born man and on public on-.u^io/ia
veuts Its feelings against moyaii Jiisiic
goyerninont. Dr. : Russel, as many ofhvrs
have done, incurred the anger of the Rus
sian authorities by his seditious utter
ances at a student meeting and his ar
rest was ordered. Aided by a sister, then
but 26 years old, he escaped from Kflff
one njsrht. Ulssruised a; a Mohammedan,
and fled to Roumania.
For her loyalty to her brother Dr.
Russel's sister was cpndemne d~ to im
prisonment for live years, and when
he next heard from home the estate
of his father, who had turned against
the authorities because of 'the" brutal
treatment of his children, had "beeti
confiscated. From "Rouraanla the
young fugitive, went to "" Bulgaria,
thence to Greece, where he "married
tlie woman who has 6lnce shared" with
him tlie peril? attending his' frieque'rit
Journeys to the" Russian borders." aha
they then went to Paris. A^. the. end
of several years* practice as a* phyii-"
clan in the French capital" thÂ« doctor
and his vHfe came to San Fxanclsc-J.
Mrs. Russel was. an attractive woman,
who rapidly surrounded herself" with
new-made friends, who wUI readily
recall the happy social events " "they
enjoyed as the guests" "of this' enter
taining' hostess.
"It was early in 1830 that Dr. Russel
first gained prominence" tbrougo the
charges he made against Bis*hpp Vladi-'
mir of the Gr eco- Russian' 'church ""on
Powell street. ' They were, preceded by
the' withdrawal of the" doctor and his
wife from the church" and were"" fol
lowed by Russet's ' excqoTimunlcatio.nl
By this time two factions fri the church,
had become arrayed against each' other,
and a bitter war ensued, during' which
the edifice caught nre'one' nlglit and
was partially destroyed. This' incident
provoked more blttec "criminations, arid
for a time it 'was feared' that "blood.
iQlg-ht be BplUedl Dishop" Vladimir," was'
arr.cstt-d on serious charges," but theset
were' never pressed. " Llb'ei' suits were
also instituted. *
About this stage ojC the controversy,
the Russian' Consul, !~ who had been
dragged Into the affair, took sides w/tJj
the BiEh"op''and"flnally published'an a^-"
tack^upon Dr. RusseL He branded the
doctqr "as a. nihilist and charged ' him.
with' being a. fugitive from his native
country.- In a scathing retort Dr. Rus
scV'referred to" the Consul as being
beneath him In social rank and. un
wortby of recognition and In, evidence
Â«.f thla charge he signed his reply with
his true name, thus furnishing to the
pooplo the first- Intimation that" he~ was
a'nolÂ»!cman by bfrth.
' Mcanwh.iiÂ«'l>r. Russel had carried his
fight against the Bishop of the' Grec
o church .to the 'High' "Proctor
of the holy pynod at" St. ' Petersburg.
who f 'was requested' to recall t Vladimir.
One day^ while' Dr." Russel' and bis"pro

office in the Phelan building he was
awaited upon by. tea of Bishop Vladi

.that arS'sfmply seeking relief from the
autocratic power that lwa dominated so
cruelly In Russia for centuries. In one
of his recent letters the doctor refers to
..this possibility, which he says would
"end .in" the "revolution devouring Its
own 'children."
"Alj-j handr* trembles -with its pen as

Seemingly the recent countless dis
asters to the existing dynasty of Rus
/sia have added strength to the purposes
of Dr. Nicholas Russel and increased
his eagerness to avenge , the br*utal
treatment of his' father and sister and
score for himself a settlement for tha**
wrongs he *waa forced to suffer. His â¢
revolutionary spirit has developed to an
uncompromising point, as a result of
m^ny.'. years of hopeful work in tho
fdirectrdh* â¢'â¢ of assured freedom to his
* countrymen;, and as the autocracy flees

his mind becomes exhilarated by ths

a torment; he may be rough and clumsy;
he may provoke you -by forgetting his

But girls sometimes purposely and
sometimes unconsciously Imitate ' those
around them, and In speech and behavior
are* not quUe" genuine. Nobody cÂ»n have
very much patience with: an affected: girl;
a girl whom." one cannot count, who .
poses and acts a part. . You would bettsr^
ask yourself ,"D orothy, if you are alway*^ 1
simple and sincere and willing to be the

Real people who belong, to the realities â¢
of Uf if. and ' who are not . trying . to mas
querade in characters that are not their
own, are almost always \ sure of gaining
esteem.' and after esteem comes affection.
There -is Just the . possibility.'- that the
girl who mourns because she is unpopular
cares too much about it, and is too anx
ious ?to have the \u0084 conspicuous places. '
Your older Bister could tell you" of a girl
in "her 'class in college who was lovely,
provided she could be 'pushed into a posi
tion of leadership. If 'only every "one
would loolc up to her, . ask - what she
thought, and give her - the casting vote,
nobody could compare with. her in cour
tesy. " But pass f her over, . ask \ her next
door neighbor to 'walk with 1 you,* or take
thÂ« chair at a' committee meeting, and
this girl froze and was ' as cold and dis
tant and hard and unresponsive as an ice
bound brook in 'January. Let her lead,
and ' she was fascinating; omit her from,
tho programme "and 'she immediately- hf- .
came aTsphynx. ."A girl ; wha Is bound to

ijid hostess at Thanksgiving,
with all the old traditions to
be observed, the accumulation
of the years since our own
American holiday was flrst proclaimed,
and the countless devices by which the
dinner â the crowning glory of the
day â is given the charm of something
new and strange!
No other feast in all the long calen
dar is quite like this. Roast turkey
way be the chef d'oeuvre on any day.
with cranberry Jelly, and crisp celery,
find salted almonds and toasts of grati
tude for friends and lor occasions, but
only once a year does the spirit of time
bring; us a Thanksgiving- day, only
once a year do we eat a Thanksgiving
dinner.
So the housewife accepts the tacit
challenge and plans most carefully, not
only that the viands may be perfection,
but that the succession of pictures pre
sented by the table shall gladden the
eyes of her guests.
Would you like to come with me to a
prophetic feastâ a spread In prospect?
The flrst picture, of the table set for
crape fruit, is a model of simple love
liness. The graceful comports, one
clear and the other of green and rock
crystal, with the tall candlesticks, show
bow far behind Is the day that taught
\u25a0we should have glass, silver and even
the decorations of our table low and
flat. Now every dish raises its head
proudly, doing honor to its maker and
the taste of the housewife who sought
it out.
So popular has grape fruit become
with lovers of good things that special
service glasses have been designed for
It. These are lons of stem and wide of
bowl, allowing: ample space for cracked
ice, with maraschino or creme de
rncnihe cherries over the toj>. Smaller
glass lining's, filled with skinned and
chopped lobes of the fruit, chilled and
saturated with sugar and maraschino
for hours, fit into the. lee cup end are
bcld .In place by tiny stems.
The glasses are of clearest white
crystal and about their tall stems are
tied wide bows of eoft' green ribbon.
As they stand upon dainty. doilies In
the handsome place platesâ a conspicu
ous feature of all table settings this
j- ca r â I am prepared to hail their de
eigner a genius and the one who exef
cuted his design a matter craftsman.
Flower center and lovely silken
candle shades carry out the delicate
irreen color scheme, and \re who are so ,
fortunate as to be bidden to this table
THE TABLE FOR THE THANKSGIVING DINNER
to ste its pattern Droken up, .
even though we know that other mar
vels are in store.
After the oysters come two soups,
one white and one dark, and then, dis
guised by the chef's decoration almost
beyond our recognition and certainly
past our knowledge, enters the baked
salmon as claimant for our attention.
The fish table is in green, too, but
more elaborate than the first, with
portable'electrolier, two-handled lovlnjr
cup and a greater display of crystal
and silver. The fish *et. a cod pat
tern, is everything one could wish.
The plates rest upon place plates' of
Coalport English china, and with the
little bread and butters make up that
part of the service that is not given
over to/silver and glassware.
Goblets, sherry, champagne and
claret g;lasses*show that the dinner is
well started on its course. Most deli-,
cate of pattern, their slender .. stems
have felt the general tendency' of the
mode, being taller than in previous sea
sons. The crystal comport, with its of
fering of salted nuts, keeps them com
pany, and tallest of all the furnishings
are the two candlesticks of rock
crystal, with handsome shades of green
silk and chenille.
. The Special fish server with set of
knives and forks is a' distinctive fea
ture of this table. , â¢
\u25a0 "Speaking, of fish ~ and fishing," be- .
the gentleman on ray right, . and
we smile and prepare ourselves for a
stirring tale of conquest with rod and
reel. We must decline to be impressed
by anything, less than the landing of a
245-poundcr by, a lone and unaidetl
Walton, and so we warn him.
. He is not deterred, but starts brave
ly off with, "I had the best iuck of all
my career. as a fisherman at Catalina,
two weeks ago," and proceeds with a
narrative that must nqeds be trueâ
tvery detail is so /perfectly filled in.^ '
Then . some , one . asks, most politely,
whether he happens* to have a photo

MILLINERY AS SEEN IN LONDON
IN shapes the variety of London mil
linery Is so large that it is rather
difficult to pick on anything aad say
!t is not good, unless I mention the
exceedingly small hat, which Is quite
a thine of the past. The season started
with moderate sized turbans and tocjues,
out the feeiinK now Is for larger bats,
especially among "La haute mode" both
in town and in the provinces.
Tbe plain callor hat, says the October
number 'of the Millinery Trade Review,
with the brim shortened at the back, is
thought very well of and , I have seen
many of them represented In the various
llr.e* of trimmed models shown in the
West End. Red Is rather a favorite color
for this hat, end It is generally worn
T-Ith a bandeau at the back,, Riving a
decided tilt to the brim.
YÂ«"vet dome crowns are selling very
trf&s. They are used with felt or beaver
brfmg and sometimes with velvet.
It Is her intention to wrar It evenings
when she makes her friendly. trips from
house to house playing. cards. It is warm
and handsome and not top dear. Its ma
tt rial is a heavy black fur, long in tex
ture, very glossy" and becoming. The
hair, while not curly, is gract-ful and the
eogt Ivas a comfortable look. In the store
whore it was purchased "* it was called
black dog. And as' black <loj? she. bought
It and Is wearing it. ,
Another fur. which is llkt?tl, though <his
is. gtrictly for motoring,- is \ calf. This
look? nnd is e*QLCttÂ£*j like the. red' and
whito <ralf of the pasture. . It" is dressed

One of Mre. Roosevelt's friends wears
a long coat made of muskrat. It is warm
and soft and a pretty gray in color. It
is made upon very fashionable lines. The
front is straight and the' back Is light

Beaver hats are .still selling wftll in
ready-to-wear styles for traveling and

them In tha market, and the i prices are
considerably lower than last year. For
cheap and medium trade they will prob

beat trade are taking to plain felts or

It there is a novelty in dress this week
it is in the 'princessi, which is now made
walking length. ' A very handsome prin
cfss dress was fashioned of deep brown
\u25a0serge, smooth- to the hand, and firm in
texture.- It was made up with brown
chiffon <\u25a0 velvet' l trimmings, a gown fine
ariough for. reception wear almost. The.
cloak, for- it was one of- those- dresses
that must have a cloak to match.' was a
princess "with, the short waist and high
silk belt, of .a sort now so much the
voguef Such a dress can' be worn on
almost'any occasion, for it is peculiarly
dressy and designed for nleÂ« as well as
lor ' ordinary wear.
I ' New Tailor-Made Gowbi. ', ;
. The' taUbr-madei princess 1Â» also a nov
elty and one Is treated to a glimpse of
the tight-fitting princess, hugging the
figure as the: glove hugs the hand, with
full bust und sweeping skirt linesâ all
snugly tailored and finished, as a tailor
finishes a tailor-made gown.
One very handsome princess was stitch
ed and'the seams "werd strapped, though
it was a 1a 1 cashmere gown and though the
lines were soft and almost fluffy. But it
was tailor-made just the same-and the
tailor had f finished the : dress with the
most approved stitchery. This Is just v
fad. which nerds ilie test of time before
one can" decide upon its merits.
,But one must pass along Â«to the nov
<>lties,:--*for-there isfno oue-who tloe* not
like to -know, what; ia new .in fashion's
line. And In the novelties there is noth
ing more pronounced than the new belts,
which have grown ' wider and J narrower
at the same time,- if one can digest such
a double ' statement. ~
The narrow belts are those that are fit
ted out In leather, or. in canvas, for. they
wear canvas belts againâ or in fur. They
are cut wider in the-back than in the
front and there are! trimmings upon them.
One sÂ«e3 go|d clasps* stationed along
these belts and one; also' se^s somehand
some belt: ornaments; there are also some
vtfry. pretty chains which come " for the
trimming' of the narrow " belts. . *
\u25a0â¢'\ But the 1 fashionable j belt Is the empire
belt, which is the same width all the way
around and |lsl clasped ' arourid the fig
ure .right' above; the natural waist line.
It can be .worn, very tight and it gives
one the' little slim figure. .'
There Is a bel{: , which is being made
by 'the -French dressmakers and it is
one that is generally liked by the women,
because 'it is always , snug and always
well fitted. It" Is' a belt which is quite
novel â¢ and . one that is admired whenever
it Is worn. . ,
The foundation of this very novel belt
is a piece of ribbon three yards long and
three inches .''wide. For evening the
width can be four inches and the shade
a delicate one; for daytime a black rib
bon Is best. v. . ,
A French, dressmaker, bought three
yards of orchid . pink' satin ribbon four
inches wide for one of her patrons. This
will make a belt which Just fits the fig
ure.
An Idea In Girdles.
The rule for putting on the belt is as
follows: Take one end of the ribbon
in the, hand and fasten it in the
middle' of the front' of the waist
line. Now begin and # wind tight
ly around the waist gradually making
the. belt wider and smoother until the
right. depth Is reached for a handsome
girdle effect. Have at hand a pretty
metal buckle and at the last winding
slip ;the ribbon through the buckle.
Fasten the end of the ribbon invisibly
at the side in such, a manner that the
buckle comes in the middle of the back.
This gives a very youthful figure. Or
the buckle can be arranged to come in
the middle of the front.
A button girdle was one of tho novel
ties worn at a card party recently. The
girdle, which was made upon crinoline,
stiffened and boned, was of forget-me
not blue silk. It fastened in the middle
of the back, and, running ' around it,
there was a delicate tracery of forget
me-nots. The feature, however,' was a
little row of blue silk buttons made of
covered button molds, arranged along
the upper edge of the girdle and along
the 'lower edge, sÂ«t slightly, apart, and
with each, button embroidered on top
with a tiny forget-me-not "flower with
v scarlet heart â the tiniest seed of red
silk. This was an -exceedingly pretty
thing. . , . . - .â.
Passing*. to the boa. girl one can say
that she la. out lv full force, this winter
and one sees many of her clan upon
the , thorpughfares these windy days.
The boas. are made of fur, of. feathers.
of ribbon and of chiffon ruffles. The
silk muslin boa -to match the costume
Is one of the prettiest of all things and
next to it comes the boa which Is a
combination of silk, muslin, chiffon,
chenille and feathers, all combined in
one lovely flat neck piece.
The greatest novelty in the boa Una
was seen at a reception the other day.
where one of the pretty guests wore a
girdle made of the same material as
her boa, which was a mass of tiny rib
bon loops and silk ruffles. The girdle
was In gray to match the boa. And
around the foot of the skirt there was
a trimming three Inches wide of the
very*same stuff." It made, as charming
a trimming as one could desire and the
costume, which was of itself a beauti
ful silver gray, had the French touch,
\u25a0which .is so admirable in all things of
dress. . .
The season Is an orthodox one. The
staple styles rule and there Is little
that is freaky in dress. At the sains
time it is a season that Is full of novel
ties and- the. well dressed woman can
have an opportunity to achieve some
thing distinctive in dress should she de
sire to do so. tForerunners of Empire

VERT. nearly upr>n the Tropic cf Cxn
cer. but a lone way, beyond the
Sandwich group, there Is an Island
almost unknown to the tlv.-ellrra
in Polynesia. A small boat with two men
in It lay off this shore one day and tossed
on the long rollers *of the. Western
Pacific. ' I
One of the men In the boat .t stared
across the water with weary, observant
-eyes. It was three years since Allison
had last eeen the island, and the years
had changed the man. but they had not
changed the broad stretch of beach or
the grassy htl!Â« bpyond it. If the planet
had been Rat one mlsht have looked from
th'.s higher ground 8000 miles to South-
America md passed one's eyes over noth
ing but the sea waves.
The other man on board wore a red
shirt, and he almost covered the chicken
coop of a cabin by reclining on It while he
rmoked. "What part of the map Is it,
J!m?" he inquired.
â¢This Is the ulace we're after." Allison
replied. "We've fetched it right enough.
I uped to call it Island- of Faraway.
L-ooks lonelier than ever; but there is a
village over beyond them palms."
They took the boat In carefully over the
bar and made her fast; but there wore no
s'lgns of life, except for a few scared sea
fowl, which flew up screaming as the
men waded ashore. The odorous trade
winds were roaring in the treetops over
head; the never-pausing thunder of the
surf lulled the listener's senses, and these
sounds and the deep solitude brought
back the past to Allison. He walked up
to the higher ground and turned to look
at the breakers, which rolled In with the
weight of the Pacific bchiml them.
"Seems most like old times." he said to
the othtr man. Holmes. "Many's the
hour I've laid right here and watched
that everlasting old water-line, wondering
whether there might be a ship behind it.
Wooh! lonely! I'd ko almost wild some
times." He gazed down upon the bay
and the little boat at her moorings. A
bit of <llngy . bunting fluttered from the
bow; and although it was dingy, and the
view insignificant, it had now a kind of
haughty meaning, as If to proclaim that
an American craft lay there and that a
new flag was upon the waters of the
world.
The weary eyes of Allison brightened;
his cureless figure seemed to Rwell. He
put a hand on Holmes' shoulder and
pointed 'one way and the other.
"Look at there. Ijenry," he said, with
Ik kind of shamed enthusiasm. "Over that
way, to our backs, is San Francisco and
the States. And down there is the Phil
ippines, where Dewey is. But here on
this side we're the farthest out of any
Americans. I tell you it makes a fellow
I<*cl responsible!"
"Where'g your villager* asked Holmes
ai length.
"Come on; over this way," and the two
trudged heavily inland through the big
l.rilllant ferns. There has been a path
through these as Allison remembered, and
it has disappeared: but the significance
of ihJs fact did not occur to him until
they came out before a huddle of molder
ing huts, with rank grass growing: every
where. Holmes gave a dry whistle.
\u25a0â¢Tliis your village?"
"Seems to be." replied Allison, ruefully.
Ht looked around him with a feeling. of
depression at that abandoned place.
"Wonder what's become of 'cm"' he said,
in hl whisper, as though he feared to walk
.. tn. mil their ghosts. . **They were seal de
cent iÂ»eoiÂ»le for niggers, and J u ?t like chll
ilrin, ton â so inn<Â«v-nt."
"Sonubodi- Is comln* out of that far
thest Elianty." Holmes observed. . v\ i
'â¢Well, no*-. If that ain't old i:m Harri
son!" th* othor said. "11*110, Benjamin!?
he added, "where aro nil the rtst of you?

"I declare. 1 should think go," AlUnon.
remarked.

"Oh. brace to!" said . the other, with \

All that nfgfcC while they lay in "the *
hut of old Ben Harrison, the rumble cf \
the ocfan was present to their ears and, <
the Uade winÂ«Js'roai<d above them in tho
trcetops. Allison did not sleep very"

of a tluiterinK bit of "flag.

around the coast to where the newer vil
laxe lay.

i All Rights Reserved.)
T "TT "\ITIJ, all his excellencies John
\f\ J Knox was neither a conspicu-
V ously courteous nor prudent
man, but he never did anything
â¢o rude or foolish as th?.
book which he published in Geneva in
1558 and which he called, to give the full
title, "The First Blast of the Trumpet
Against the Monstrous Regiment of
Women."
&V regiment the former, of course.
meant not a battalion but the government
of women, and there Is this excuse for
his wild outbreakâ that he had been ban
ished from England by Mary Tudor, and
\u25a0was forbidden in Scotland by Mary of
Guise, end not being a person of remark
able docility he was furiously angry that
he should toe kept from his work by the
authority of women- Women indeed
were very much In evidence in those days,
because Elizabeth was to succeed Mary
In England, and Queen Mary Stuart was
to succeed her mother the Regent in
Scotland, while Catherine de Medici wa*
queening it in Prance. Scotland, Eng
land, Krance, it did not matter where you
went you came against a woman ruler,
and a Very determined one who did not
intend to stand any nonsense if she could
help it, and was not inclined to bow the
knee to. -reforming, preachers.
So Knox lifted up his voice against the
rule of women, and blew \u25a0 his brazen
ti-umpet with all his, might, proving from
Scripture, to the best of h\s ability, but
not very successfully, that women should
not be on the throne. Deborah troubled
him very "much and Stevenson believed
that Kncx left 'his bones at that point,
but Deborah served him in good stead
afterward, for when he tried to make
his peace with 'Queen Elizabeth (and
failed) he admitted that there were two
exceptions to the principle of penal subor
dination; one. was Deborah, and the other
was Elizabeth. Stevenson declares that
the book was a dull performance, and
this is certain that it would have been
better for Knox, and a goodly number^ of
other men, ,to "have left women alone,
when they were able to rule as well as
Elizabeth of England and the Queen
mother of Scotland.
The Head of the Household.
Whatever be the theory- of the marriage
eervice, to leave the Scripture alone, life
has to be regulated by facts, and there
tire wexnen born to rule and men who
are best ruled. There is a fitness in
things and each case must stand on its
own merits, and that was the lesson
which a census official learned one day
when he. called for the return of the
members of a household. .'\u25a0''*. V
"You are not a widow, Mrs. Jamieson?"
said tlie census man after examining the
paper. , .
â¢â¢No.'^rnra married woman."
"Quite so, then is your husband away
from home, or is he not living with you?"
"What do you mean?" replied Mrs.
Jamleson with a touch of acerbity.
â¢'John's not a sailor, and I would 'like
to see him llvin" anywhere except in his
own house."
"That is all right, Mrs. Jamleson: I
quite understand," and the census man
saw the necessity of being conciliatory,
"but why is your husband not entered as
head of the household?"
"Lord bless you," and Mrs. Jamleson
surveyed the official with much amuse
ment. '-'Did ye ever see John? Head of
the household!" and Mrs. Jamleson was
Quite c4rried . away by the thought.
"Te're a very, facetious man."
Whether the defect was in John's body
or In John's mind did not appear, but It
was clear teat for Mr. Jamleson to have
been ruler In that household would have
been a violation of nature, flying in the
face of the law of gravitation. Very like
ly, and especially if John was a sensible
man, he would recognize the wisdom of
providence in making up for his deficien
cies, physical or mental, and supplying
him on the principle of compensation
with a masterful wife. And one can be
lieve that John was kept in the paths
of peace and righteousness by Mrs. Jam
ieson's strong hand, and that his affairs
were- .successfully managed. People of
the caliber of Mr. Jamieson have much
cause to be thankful that they are not
the head of the household, and have not,
therefore, .had the opportunity of squan
dering their goods and playing the fool.
- Author and Editor.
It does not follow of course that
gentlemen of the Jamleson type may
not bare gifts of their 6wn, although
they be not ilt for "regiment," for the
following conversation between an
eflltdr. and one of his most frequent
contributors throws some light upon

another variety of the same situation.
"You have done pretty well with
your last book.", said the great man who
depended upon a fixed salary and not
the lottery of fiction. "You must- have
taken Jn a good sum in royal ties." '
The author, admitted that be had.
but felt that .* more talk . was coming.'
and that this Interest in his private
affairs would have some practical-con
clusion. â¢ <.
"Are you laying anything "past for
â¢ your wife and children?", continued the
editor, with firm, searching accents,
"or are you spending every penny like
the other young fools?" "With marked
allusion to the fact that when a man's
book succeeds and It is a novel he is
apt to start a riding horse for the
park and a victoria for. his wife. The
trembling author assured his monitor
that he was : saving every penny, that
he could, and that the last thing he
would dream of would be riotous liv
ing, and then he ventured to inquire
what was the reason for this solicitude.
"Because," said, the moralist, "I have
been to your hotise." where indeed the
editor had been exceedingly well at
tended to and aent away, warmed and
filled. "And I've seen your wife." Then
after a pause during which he sur
veyed the rising: author with calm Im
partiality, "Yes, I haVe seen your wife,
and you would be a poor creature apart
from her."
It was the kind of plain speaking
which an editor allows himself when
be is talking to an author, but It was
not very far from the truth, for that
particular writer, may have a slender
gift for fiction, but he haa none - what
ever for household affairs. He has,
however, the sense to know his own
Incapacity, and brings every penny he
earns to his wife, who Â« arranges for
everything and pays for everything and
sees that her husband : has' a new suit
of clothes when he absolutely needs,
them, and gives him a' small sum ' for \u0084

<CoPTrtght, : 1905. â¢by Edward 'W. TjxwwwiwJ.)Individual Rights of
Servants
Mary E. Carter
(Copyright. 1905, by A. S. Barnes & Co.)
THOSE who are scrupulously just
acknowledge, and carefully avoid
interfering with, the rights "of
others, no matter In what relation
they may eland to them. Whether It
be as parent and child, or as employer
and employe, cr In those relations re
versed, the rights of all of us are as
much our own as any private property
â¢which belongs to us, and whoever In
fringes on any of our rights. Intentional
ly or unintentionally! robs us.
A privilege is a favor which one may
confer, but yet has a perfect right to
withheld; or which, with good cause,
may even be withdrawn after having
been granted. Not so a right. While a
right may have to be established. If it
has been Infringed upon, it Is none the
less a right, and as much our own as
anything we possess unmolested by the
unwarranted Interference of another.
Almost all lawsuits, feuds, public and
private, as well as the bloody wars
which have disgraced mankind, have
been the result of Infringement upon
some one's, rights, in a wordâ injustice.
Privileges' are granted because of a
kindly feeling of the granter. or possibly,
at times, because something is expected
In return.. Thanks are always due from
the recipient who is favored with privi
leges, iiut we take our rights whenever
we are not hindered from so doing, and
are under no obligations at all to ex
press any thanks for being left in un
disturbed possession of 'what belongs to
us. The domestic enters household ser
vice with a verbal agreement regarding
her duties and certain wages and leis
ure times stipulated for. These are her
rights, and anyone who deprives her of
any one of them Is guilty of injustice,
and, if It be done without her tree con
sent, -is also open to the charge of hav
ing broken the contract- The maid has
as good a right to refute to wash, or
iron, or cook, or sweep, after agreeing
to d> that work, as her employer has to
deprive her of her day off, or her lclrure
hours because she happens to be in the
house. Simply because the girl is within
callâ when it i* her tlnr.e offâ gives no
employer* even the privilege, much less
any right, to call upon her for snrvice
at those times. On the contrary, no
matter what the emergency, ' fire and
ilood exceptod. if It bo her time oft a
maid should not be atked to do anything
without a definite acknowledgment that
you are p.tMns a favor cf her, and in
t*nd to repay It, or else a. bargain should
be made for the extra service desired.
An.l. further, the servant has a perfect
rights, and any one who deprives her of
leisure for any compensation whatever.
When we realize how little persona!
freedom, or time to call their own.
hwse sctvants, women especially, usual
ly have. It. is no wonder that they* feel
aggrieved to be called from their rooms,
iftcr they have rpt-nt many hours at
:oiu!nu<.!!fc work, and their lawful period
ot rcsrJtc has arrived.
It fs not a oucMion of how all the
housework I* 10 set done, neither is It
it question of haw the overburdened
housewlie Is to yet along. buC It la a
question of fair bocr* for one i\ho Is In

I think I described last year an
odd, yet picturesquely pretty cen
tre-piece for Thanksgiving dinner
made of a halved pumpkin. Vary it
this season by leaving a broad band
of the shell, carved lengthwise, a3
the handle of an oblong basket. Hol
low the pumpkin neatly, scalloping
or pointing the edges, and fill it with
fruit, wreathing the handle with
bright ribbons. Admit no flowers to
the table or rooms except chrysan
themums, if you can afford to buy
these. If not, take time to, run out
into the country in. quest of gray
moss, often found pendant from the
branches of aged cedars. I have seen
it a foot long in northern woods.
Witch-hazel stars were quenched,by
early November frosts, but the
brownish^crimson and royal purple
leaves of the oaks still flaunt de
fiance to winds that have stripped
the boughs of les3 hardy trees; stone
fences and iiedge rows are draped
with misty clematis-down, and
there is abundant store of bitter
sweet berries. Get ground moss â
beautiful in shade of graysâ as a
Eaat for the pumpkin basket. Hang
a light wicker basket lined with
these mosses from the chandelier
over, the ..table, and , trail 'sprays of
partridge berry down the side. ,
In all let the MOTIF be thank
fulness for the blessings of Harvest

The merest line of beading or veinlng of
Insertion and lace holds the smart

frequently take the place of shoulder

This Is especially practicable, but origi

A delightful little corset cover is made

\u25a0 \u25a0"I could be no more Interesting
\u25a0* thing to the person, -taking an
Â«xter.ded and leisurely trip abroad
than a visit to an eider duck farm. He
wiJI be obliged to go far up along the
coast of Norway, and particularly to
the Island of the' euphonious name,
Isafjardarjup, to see this unique sight,
but It will greatly repay him. \
The. reason they have eider . duck
farms there is because of the strict
protection the Norwegian law gives .to
this beautiful water fowl in its' wild
staio; which became of great necessity,
some years ago, the commercial col
lector of down and eggs having from
time out of mind put such. vast drains
or. the species that the wild colonies
had become bo diminished that the ex
tinction of the cider duck-was & ques
tion of only a very short time. T ? Then ;
enterprising natives , began domesticat
ing the fowl, which seems to have been
a somewhat easy matter. "
Isafjardarjup Island, where the do
mestication "of the eider duck began,
and where the -.-principal, duck fafms
are, is about thiee-quarters of a mile
in length, and is protected by a sea
i^all along' its coasts. This seawall Is
* ivith : small compartments,
formed '^ by leaving; out or removing
stones at close intervals. These cavi
ties were left for the ducks to nest In.
There are . thousands ; of them. . and !: at
the nesting season not: one can., be
found but- will contain -the nest of an
enough to be carried out by even an. in
experienced seamstress.
The quality of the: lace chosen for lin
gerie trimmings has much to do with the
success of the garment. Valenciennes Is
used more often than any other, but a
small amount of one of trie good imita
tion Valenciennes is infinitely preferable
to a greater amount of the lace of coarse,
cheap quality. If the maker cannot af
ford to buy much trimming let her make
tiny hand tucks and herringbone stitch
bear the brunt of the trimming, and let
only a wee bit of lace be. used, .but 'have
that wee bit of good quality.
Deep embroideries or combined embroid
ery and lace flouncing are made espe
cially for, use In corset covers. They are
made up full with na shaping save "in the
underarm seams and belt. â¢ Some of these
materials are coarse and' florid,'. but oth
ers are really charming. .They are as a
rule made with machine- worked eyelets
for ribbon set along under the scalloped
edges, and some of the. flouncing ha 9 a
little lace frill set under the scallop edge.
Shoulder straps formed of ribbon or of a
narrow strip of embroidery insertion hold
the cover over the shoulder, and beading
forms a belt.' . -\u25a0"?\u25a0â ' â¢ \u25a0 : >v-

THE mistresses of some households
seem to Imagine- that, because
they are only able to afford "a
.girl for general housework" it is
impossible for her towait on the table
properly,. no matter how light her duties
may otherwise be. \u25a0
Now, when, the family is small and the
work not too heavy, one domestic, with
a little assistance from'Uh'e lady of the
house, can easily do it all- and yet find
time to pass the viands correctly at din
ner. At breakfast or luncheon, unless
guests are present, all that should be
required of such a maid in the way of
waiting is that she.be like "Sairy" in
"Daviu Harum," who was for "bringing
In and taking out," leaving the famiiy to
do their own passing.: . \u25a0
Now, it is not at all difficult to teach a
servant to wait on table properly if one
is only willing to take.the requisite time
and pains. First show : the maid how 'to
set the table as it should be done. Re
move the cloth i that covers 'it between
meals, fold thi3 carefully, and put it
away. Then, cover- thertable with-, the
Canton riannel .or felt, pad that should
always be under the tablecloth'to-make
it smooth and soft; nest the cloth itself
is put in place,; care being taken , to -get
it on' straight.... lmpress, also upon.' the
maid that when she removes the cloth
to put* It -away;, ehe: must 'fold "It in; the
original creases that were made by the
iron," otherwise it will look mussy.very.

'To : be t sure, the \u25a0 wedding day Is too
dear a time to every young heart not to
have special preparation. All the things
dear to a bride should be tenderly gath
ered together. The "things" should be
new; s and- they should be dainty and.
sweetâ Just llko their owner. But.. look-;
ing at It , in . Its true light, nothing? Is
so foolishly out of place as fancy, .ex
pensive lingerie." la lavish quantities, !a
the wardrobe tof " a bride of limitstf
means. â¢ *
It Is -a fact to be lamented that thÂ«
majority of young " women- are In thin
class, which sees nothing beyond as big
a display as can possibly be managed.
Not mentioning it as a matter of good
taste/ would it not be more practical; if
the bride has laid away a few hundred
dollars, to spend It upon some furnish
ing . for ' the new - horne â something : that
both can enjoy together in comfort and
sweet peace when trousseau furbelows
are long ago worn out? But, you say,
your fiance is a man of means and can
give you at the start all you could pos- .
slbly wish for in your home. Very? well,
then; Jet: your trousseau be simple and
modest, like your past living, for-prln*
ciple. \u25a0\u25a0â¢ If nothing else. If your husband
can deck you In fine clothes afterward,
let him do so to his. heart's content. But .
in .the name of all that's practical, mod
est ' and . tasteful, when you come . to. the
one - man in â¢ the .- world, come as your
own true self, decked In clothes pretty,
and neat and new,: but not costing- one
penny beyond what- you'can afford.--.,
A word to the wise: The neater and
sweater you are. the more you show to
this one man lit the world 'that your
great happiness in thl3. wedding day la
that, you are coming' unto- your own,
that you are coming. to him. the happier
he will be and the more -will he. devote

GIVES UP IMHERITAMCE TO WED
WASHERWOMAN'S DAUGHTER.
Tor i\\- first time the ntory lÂ« here told of the romantic marriage of a member of one of Germany's noblest
f-tmUlcs to a pretty peasant (jlrl. For love of Anna SchuU Count Francis Erbach forfeited a vast property and a
fortune of more than g1.000.000 a year. He quarreled rrlth his aristocratic relatives, -who formally disinherited

Special Cable to The Call
BERLIN. Nov. 25. â That Count Fran
cis Erbach, a young' German nobleman
"f exalted ranl^sh&tt' created a sensa
tion In this country by marrying a
\u25a0washerwoman's pretty daughter Amer
ii an readers have already been told by
a few lines in the cabin dispatches.
Hardly more than a suggestion, how
over, was thus given of what must be
â¢lesrrfbed as one of the most striking
romances in the annals of German so
ciety.
Some of the details here given in eon
neciion with it have not even been
published hi Berlin, but with the ac
companying photographs have been re
ceived from a roliabJe'eorrespondent in
the neighborhood of the Count's an
â¢ ostral estate in the German Grand
Duchy of Hesse.
To begin with, it should be remem
bered that the German aristocracy is
far more exclusive and far more jeal
ous of Its rights and privilege? than
the aristocracy of England, or France
or Italy. German Count* and Barons,
with a line of ancestors extending back
to the darkest early middle ages, look
down with contempt on the mushroom
families which l;&.ve sprung "up in Eng
land and other countries during 'the
last three or lour centuries.
Count Francis Erasmus Erbach is
the oldest son of the reigning Count
vxd tvas thus the heir to all the wealth
and glory of the family. He was
brought up in strict seclusion and his
tutors took especial pains to imbue him
with the family priue and with respect
for the family traditions.
Being: an intelligent, good-natured
r.nd amiable youth, the young noble
man rapidly became a favorite among
his fellow students.
THE FIRST MEETING.
About a year after he began his
Ftjdies at Bonn he was riding one day
hi the forests of the ancestral estate
at Erbach. in Hesse, when he saw for
the first time the girl who has now
become his \u25a0wife. The young Count,
who made a striking figure on bis
Â»=p!rited steed, accosted the peasant girl
on the pretext of asking her which
road he ought to follow and' contrived
to enter into conversation with her. He
four.d that she was as intelligent in
conversation a*? she was attractive in
appearance. Henceforth the youthful
aristocrat courted the peasant girl with
unremitting patience, notwithstanding
nil the obstacles which were placed In
his way. His discovery that she was
the daughter of the village washer
woman. Frau Schulz. did not dampen
!iif ardor. The meeting of the young
couple had to be clandestine, for the
Count* recognized the impossibility oi
courUnsr the washerwoman* daughter
in public. Consequently they met In
ppcluded paths of the surrounding for-
Hrta and wandered arm in arm along
unfrequented ways where they were
comparatively safe from observation.
THRASHED BY HER FATHER.
It was impossible, however, that a
young Tnrtn of such distinguished ap
pearance and !?o well known throughout
the neighborhood as the young Count
should -walk abroad wjth a pretty peas
ant girl without sooner or later attract
ing attention. The first opposition came
from the relatives of the girl. whos<?
father heard the rumor that she was
Urejjirig company with the young noble
man. Happening to meet the Count on
a country road soon afterward the
sturdy peasant accosted him and said.
"My neighbors tell me that your Serene
Highness haunt 3 the neighborhood of
my cottage when I nm away from home
in order to pay attentions to my daugh
ter Anna. I Â«1o not want any fine.gen
tleman pursuing my daughter, who Is
v. good g' r ' a^ fl 11 marry a man in
hr-r own station of life. I, must there
fore beg your Serene Highness to be
pood cno;;gh to cease your attentions to
my daughter and not turn her head by
flatteries, but to leave her in peace."
Count r"f&SCIÂ» Erasmus, who was
considerably disconcerted by this un
expected' attack, replied that h<Â» â¢ was
deeply in iove with the girl and that he
\u25a0aw no reason why ho should not con
tinue to see her. A scne occurred, in
t)i<> midst of which Anna's brother ap
peared to back up his father. - More
words ensued. tir\& finally the two
sturdy pensar.ts seized the young aris
"tocrÃt. dragged him into an Jidjolning
and there administered to
Him the soundest thrashing which their
muscular ?<rms v?Â»re capable <^f Inflict
ing. Undaunted by this chastisement,
however. Count Francis Erasmus * con
tinued to woo the peasant girl. - and
The San Francisco Call.
GERMAN NOBLEMAN WHOSE ROMANTIC MARRIAGE CAUSED HIS ARISTO
CRATIC RELATIVES TO DISINHERIT HIM AND THE WASHERWOMAN'S
PRETTY DAUGHTER, WHOM HE MADE HIS WIFE.
Anna Schulz, who was very much in
love with her handsome and high-born
admirer, repudiated all responsibility
for her relatives' violence and continued
to meet her lover in the forest. At
that time, however, they took more care
to keeep their meetings secret.
GETS ANOTHER LICKING.
The story of the thrashing adminis
tereu to the Count by the girl's father
and brother also began to be whispered
about and lost nothing in repetition. The
result was that Count Francis Erasmus'
father, the reigning Count, heard of the
affair and demanded explanations from
his son. A violent quarrel ensued in
the course of which Count Francis Eras
mus Informed his infuriated father that
he was fully determined to marry the
washerwoman's daughter as soon as he
came of age. On this occasion Count
Francis Erasmus, who waa then with
in a few weeks of his twenty-first birth
day, received his second thrashing in
connection with his romantic love af
fair.
Count Francis Erasmus had to face
many othrer obstacles to his mesalli
ance. Air the members of the Erbach
ramlly agreed among- themselves not to
speak to him or to recognize him as a
relative until he gave a solemn pledge
to abandon his matrimonial project. He
was boj-cotted not only by his own
relatives, but by the members of the
other aristocratic families in the neigh
borhood. On two occasions this social
boycott Involved the self-willed young
nobleman In duels with other young
aristocrats -whose neglect to treat him
with th* ordinary marks, of respect Ir
ritated him to such an extent that he
challenged them to combat. One duel
was fought with a certain Baron Gab
lenz and the other with a Count Buch
waldt.
RUNS AWAY TO LONDON.
As soon as he had attained his
majority last December Count Francis
Erasmus began to . consider definite
plans for marrying Anna Schulz. In
his own neighborhood he found the ob
etacles*to be Insurmountable. In Ger
many a multitude of .documents are
necessary before a marriage, can 'be
solemnized ar.d the young Count was
unable to obtain tho necessary papers.
He was also unable to find . a clergy
man who was willing to marry him to
the washerwoman's daughter. He soon
decided that tho marriage could be ar
ranged In England with less difficulties
than elsewhere.- A'few -weeks ago he
walked, out of the Tancestral castle
earls' one mornlng ; and 'announced that
he was going- on a. hunting expedition
sothat he would not return home, until
late at night, g An hour later he met
Anna Scbulz at'an appointed, place in
the forest and 'proceeded with her to- a
villas c a - few - miles '\u25a0 ' away, .-where Â»' a

motor car was awaiting the fugitives.
After a residence in London of three
weeks they were able to be married by
special license. As soon as he reached
London tho Count Informed his father
of his intention and in the Intervening
three weeks he -was submitted to great
pressure to abandon his design. ' A
special emissary of the Erbach family
came across t,o- London and sought to
dissuade him by all possible means
from his intention of marrying the
plebeian peasant girl. This emissary
was present at the wedding and tele
graphed the news of the family disas
ter to the reigning Count.
BRIDEGROOM DISIXHERITED.
The reigning Count on receiving the
news of the mesalliance contracted in
London called a family council to con
sider the question of the family succes
sion. Without any ado whatever this
family council resolved that Count Frap
cis Erasmus must be disinherited and re
garded *â¢ a ooc^l outlaw. The husband
of the washerwoman's daughter has been
reduced to an annual allowance of 51000.
By his marriage he has sacrificed not only
one of the foremost positions of Europe,
but also an annual Income estimated at
$1,000,000. Questioned, on his return from
Londvi, by a newspaper interviewer,
Count Francis Erasmus said:
"My relatives have offered me an al
lowance of 4000 marks a year but only on
condition that I renounce my princely
rank and abandon the name of
I have no â¢ intention of accepting their
offer on this condition. I intend to re
main a Count Erbach arid to reject their
money. They can disinherit me so far as
the property Is "concerned, but they can
not rob me of my own name. I do not
for a moment regret the step I have
taken, on the contrary we are perfectly
happy. I intend to work for my living
and I have already taken steps to find
employment. I am not sure yet what
form of work I shall obtain, but I be
lieve I shall choose the newspaper field.
Alter undergoing a course of training lii
a newspaper office in Germany I believe
I shall go to Paris or .London as the cor
respondent of a Lading German news

' LONDON, Nov. 25.â 1t is characteristic
of American women in England that
when they go in for anything they do it
most thoroughly,' whether it be social
splendor arid extravagance or, social re
form. A striking instance of this, In the
latter field, was afforded at the Women's
Congress,, held last week at Birmingham,
by the Hon. Mrs. Bertrand Russell, wife
of Earl Russell's brother and a daughter
of Mrs. Pearsall Smith of Philadelphia.
One of the subjects of discussion was
the condition of women wage earners
and the best methods of improving their
lot. Unlike the great, majority of the
titled and \u25a0 untltled dames \u25a0 â¢ present who
ventilated their theories on. the subject,
Mrs. Russell conceived the, notion that
practical knowledge was essential to its
proper understanding. She considerably'
startled the assemblage by describing her
experience as a "factory hand." -It was a
Bermondsey ropewalk that she* fixed on
as experimental ground. She disguised
herself in a tawdry blouse with broken
button-holes and frayed and dirty lace,
wore a row of curlers In her front hair
and a skirt that had seen better days. af
some remote period. , She jvas: given; em

; According' to her story] .she; met with
much rough kindness- "from >her? fellow
workers and won their gbpdÂ» will .by Join
ing heartily in Uhe songs; and choruses
which were the features of their scanty
"off-time." She ate- the same ' fare as
theydid. She listened. 'to their confi
dences about-. their "blokes" and' parried'
their Interested questions as to -whether
"her bloke"; ever struck her. "Mind ye,
hA do it* yet: they mostly all does!"
was the universal' opinion. She shared
their lives ai*' interests as' far as possi
ble, only drawing the line at; the swing
ing doors' of the gin palaces where the
"blokes" usually; tried to get their sweet
hearts to finish the evenings.
Mrs. Russell is still young and hand
some, and possesses a physique capable of
enduring the somewhat cruel test of week
after week in the fetid atmosphere of a
rope factory. As simply attired she stood
on the platform and told her^ interesting
story she presented a striking contrast
to some of the other figures on the plat
form, notably Lady Battersea in sables
and \ diamonds,'- and i Lady Aberdeen with
solitaire pearls worth a fortune showing
under the fdge of her hat. It was Mrs.
Russell, by the way, who first started the \
idea of founding scholarships for Ameri
can^girls at the English i universities on
lines similar to the Rhodes benefaction.

KAISER'S SECOND SON
NOT HER FIRST LOVER
Princess Sophie Charlotte, Who Will Wed Prince Eitel, Has
Former Sweetheart Now Living in America.
Special Cable to The Call.
BERLIN, Nov. .25. â The engagement
of the KaiÃer's second son. Prince Eitel
Frederic, to Duchess Sophie Charlotte
of Oldenburg, only daughter of Grand
Duke Frederic Augustus of Oldenburg,
has given rise to so many conflicting
reports, so interesting and in some
cases sensational in character, that a
plain statement of the facts of the case
appears desirable. .It has been stated,
for instance," thatT>uchess. Sophie Char
lotte has been forced to engage herself
to Prince Eitel Frederic by her. stern
father, in'oppostion to her own desires,
Jn^Tdrder that she should contract 7a"
'brilliant-matrimonial; alliance. '\ On. tho
other I hand,"" it has. been suggested;, that
,the Kaiser's-'sonjh'as/contracted a rries- j
alliance .*&ri"; account of; the various j rur
mors arid scandals with' his
fiancee's ( name. These which
have^been awldely circulated J in.the Eu
ropean press,' are based on'a very slen
der foundation:'. '.:
It' is true", that there is a'disparity of
age between: Prince Eitel FrederiCand
his future' wife. ; Prince Eltel Frederic
celebrated, his twenty-second birthday
last July and" Duchess Sophie Charlotte
will be 27 in February, so that she is*
more than four years older than her,fu
ture husband. This, however,- is the
only possible objection which could be
urged against the match. Duchess . So
phie Charlotte" is in. every sense a very
desirable young lady.
SHE PIKES AWAY.
S.ome years ago her friends and rela
i tives noticed that she seemed to be fad
"Jng away. - She was sad- and silentand
seemed to take no pleasure in the
youthful joys of life.- Her stepmother.
Grand Duchess Elizabeth, was greatly
concerned" and did" everything in. her
: power, to ascertain" the cause of Duch
ess Sophie Charlotte's depression: v Doc
.tors were consulted, but were unable to
rind any cause 'for her perpe'tual'melan
choly. Her. heart arid her lungs were
sound and her organism was in perfect
condition. She was sent to recruit her
energy : ln the bracing air of the Swiss
mountains, but returned in* the same
melancholy" condition." She \u25a0 was " sent to
the south of France, but "no change in
her demeanor became 1 - visible. At last
the persona of her environment divined,
the truth, namely, that Duchess Sophie
Charlotte was secretly and ' unhappily'
In love. v - - \u25a0'\u25a0 -
The pursuit of ; this, line of investiga
tion soon revealed the fact that the object
of her affection was her , father's aide de
camp. Baron yon Pletteriberg. . Baron yon
Plettenberg was a young German j noble
man, who was r as ; handsome 'and chival
rous as he was poor. He was as much In
love with Duchess Sophie Charlotte as
she was^with him; and it is probable that
at one time he entertained hopes that the
objections to their marriage would even
tually be overcome. He was certainly
inferior to Duchess. Sophie: Charlotte in
rank and j birth, , but { he was nevertheless
a noblemanof good family; and": ancient
descent, so that while' a Vnatrimonial al
liance ' with him necessarily" have
been- morganatic :: there ' would . have been
nothing disgraceful" about it : for , the
young Duchess.
HER DREAM SHATTERED.
In course of time Duches3 Sophie Char
lotte confided to her father that.she.en
tertained the hope of being able to marry
Baron . yon â¢ Plettenberg. . . . Grand ; Duke
Frederic Augustus , was not overjoyed at
this communication. .'He made: it: clear
immediately \u25a0 that ' he ; would never consent
to the match, and. Duchess Sophie; Cha
rlotte, \on ; hearings the . reasons .which , he
gave for his , decision, bravely accepted
the Inevitable.* She made- up; her mind to
overcome her love and to fulfill tne duties,
due to her name ; and; rank.
;; â¢ Baron ,yon, yon Plettenberg's conduct' was
Irreproachable.. -He -proceeded to , Bo
ston - and ; has j resided in ;, America ; ever
since. The fact that Grand Duke Fred
eric j Augustus ;. exercised \ Influence \on
, the > young ; nobleman's^ behalf : is * alone
sufficient ' proof -that his conduct in con
nection with! Duchess Sophie Charlotte
wasMir every respect upright and strict-,
ly: honorable. ;\; \ If further.^ proof of this
were required >it was ., given ;by - Grand
Duke ' Frederic Augustus in [the spring

A , prominent"; German : newspaper, the

Dr. : : Eugene * Sierke, "^published \on F Sep ; ;
tember 23. 1903, a communication dated
from . Lubeck -in which _ various \u25a0 Insinu
ations, regarding Duchess Sophie Char
lotte's moral, character were veiled in
language the . meaning of which was
unmistakable, although guarded. The
Government v of Oldenburg thereupon
summoned the Prussian Public Prose
cutor,to take action against the Bruns
wick Landeszeltung on a charge of
criminal libel \u25a0 against Duchess Sophie
Charlotte;- -The trial took place on
June 20, ,1904, at Brunswick, and the
\u25a0editor of> the paper, Dr. â¢, Sierke. ap
peared in. the dock to answer to the
criminal charge.* Dr. Sierke's lawyer
stated that- his client had had no in
tention-of-slandering the young Duch
ess or of suggesting anything unfavor
able in regard to her : personal charac
ter. The publication in the "Landes
zeltung". simply, referred to the attach
ment of -the - Duchess for Baron -yon
Plettenberg, now in Washington. Dr.
Sierke's \u0084 lawyer .- thereupon requested
that D.uchess Sophie Charlotte herself
and- Baron, yon Plettenberg should be
summoned as witnesses and that the
proceedings should be adjourned in or
der that their evidence could be taken.
â¢ The presiding Judge ruled that the
Duchess 'â¢ and : Baron - , yon Plettenberg
should not be summoned as witnesses.
In thus ruling the Judge said. "If cpun
ser for .the. defense, desires by summon
ing these two witnesses' to prove by
their own evidence that they were at
tached to one another, I may say at
once, that his efforts are superfluous. It
may be accepted as an acknowledged
fact ; that an attachment existed be
tween the Duchess and Baron yon Plet
tenberg." ;
SLANDERER PUNISHED.
- c After, ,the -. Public Prosecutor had
pleaded for his conviction. Dr. Sierke
himself â¢ addressed the court and denied
that he had had any. intention of insult
ing, 1 the Duchess. He had offered all
possiDlc compensation to the, court of
Oldenburg and had applied for an au
dience ' with . the -Grand Duke in order
personally to apologize for j any mis
understanding which might have arisen
from' his The court, how
ever, regarded \u25a0 Dr.; Sierke's defense as
inadequate and 1 sentenced him^to^four
months*; imprisonment." while Duchess
Sophie Charlotte was given the right of
publishing the verdict : in all the lead

proceedings placed beyond all doubt the

wooed during the last two or three
years by a succession of German and
foreign Princes. The Grand Duke of
Saxe- Weimar, who afterward married
Princess Carolina of Reuss, was one of
her rejected suitors. At least four
other royal admirers, all of whom were
eminently desirable husbands In a
worldly sense, were rejected by Duch
ess Sophie Charlotte. It may. therefore,
be assumed with certainty that in ac
cepting Prince- Eltel Frederic, who in a
worldly sense Is a less desirable matri
monial prize than some of her previously
rejected suitors, she has followed the
dictates of her own heart. Prince
Eitel Frederic Is Indeed a man likely
to win the heart of a woman. He is
tall, broad and soldierly In appearance.
His face, shaven clean In American
style. Is handsome. He is described by
those versed In court affairs as the
most talented of the Kaiser's sons and
as the one who most resembles his
versatile father. He Is also supposed
to be the Kaiser's favorite son. He Is
a simple, unaffected, healthy minded
young: man, whose character has been
entirely unspoiled by the flatteries of
courtiers and the temptations of his ex
alted position. The wedding will take

shire has been greatly impoverished by
the steadily increasing transference of
its young manhood and womanhood to
the big cities and towns. Lady Vernon Is
convinced that it is the dreary monot

much of this migration and the moral
and physical deterioration which result
from It. It is no use preaching "stick
to the land" and "back to the land." shÂ»
says, unless agricultural workers are to
be provided with some other Interests in
life than 'the mere production of crops.
Opportunities for. rational recreation and
amusements must be provided for them
and some form of Intellectual atmosphere
must be created . for them, .
Her . plan is to establish clubs in com
fortable quarters with libraries, reading
rooms,. amusement rooms and halls in
which lectures and entertainments can
be given. While money would be needed
to start them, she believes that they
would soon bcome self -supporting. And
even if they didn't, she is. satisfied that

ECHOES FROM THE LODGE ROOM
Yosemite Council of the National
Union at its last meeting^had an un
usually large attendance of members
and it was decided to take steps to
make the council one of the working
om-s in this city.
Tacific Council of this city recently
tad a banquet for its members and
eleven invited guests, not members of
the order, at a prominent Toiisserte,
whore, after the discussion of a most
palatable supper, there were addresses
by President- R. J. Walsh of the coun
cil; A. S. Nelson, the vice president; A.
S. Ferguson and General Deputy Joseph
A- Wilson, who delivered one of his
â¢nammcr and tongs" talks to convince
lite strangers that "membership in the
order was just what they wanted.** A
result of the speeches was that the en
tire eleven signed in application each
to become members of Pacinc Council.
The" result of "personal effort" in the
National Union has been made manifest
in Golden Gate Council in the recent
past. It lias in the ten months that
Jias passed Initiated Jf.9 strangers, in
creasing its membership from 348 to
&06. By the initiation of twenty-three
candidates at the meeting of Novem
ber 14 "the council snatched the mem
bership banner from California Coun
cil, which had held it for seventeen
years. That this council wants to re
tain the banner is apparent from the
fact that it now has thirty-two signed
explications and the applicants are to
be examined physically within the next
ten days, each having paid his initia
tion fee. The council had a turkey
drawing for members on November 21.
General Deputy Wilson has received
reports from Sacramento, San Jose,
Btockton and Los Angeles which show
that the "increase fever" has struck
those places and that in each place
there is a better showing than has been
made in the two years that have gone
by. The councils in these localities
have undoubtedly been inspired to re
newed action for the good of the order
by the earnest letters sent them by the
general deputy.
Since the Ist inst. sixty-five replica
tions have been received at the head
quarters of General Deputy Wilson and
If the applications continue to pour in
tho average of 200 new ones will be se
cured during the month. ''
Vice President Broderick of Califor
nia Council is not at all discouraged by
the turn of affairs which resulted in
Golden Gate Council wresting the mem
bership banner from California, for
â¬ince the Ist of the current month he
has presented fourteen applications for
membership.
A feiv days since a member of the
Woodmen of the World, George C. Wal
com. found at Fourth and .Townsend

Wilson, placed the find in his keeping
end asked him to discover the owner.

Â«n the ritualistic work in the most
satisfactory manner was closed on the
evening of the third Wednesday In No
vember by Mission Council No. 1010
putting on the work in the hall of Cali
fornia Council in the Pioneer building.
This was done In a very acceptable
manner with John S. Partridge as the
candidate. In addressing the meeting
tinder good for the -order Mr. Partridge
expressed himself as deeply impressed
with the ceremony of initiation and Its
teachings, but felt that it was some
thing unusual to be â¢ "buried" twice
within a period of two weeks.
The judges In the contest for the flag
awarded It to Mission Council, declared
that it had won by forty-nine
points over California Council. The
winning council is arranging for a la
dirs* nlg-ht. on which occasion the flag
will be presented.
El Capitan Council at its last meeting
had, after routine business, a game of
vhist and the drawing of two turkeys
offered as door prizes. The last two were
won by Senator Cuthbert and General
Deputy Joseph A. Wilson.
San Francisco Council has fallen Into
line with the other local councils and
made concessions that will enable It to
secure members "just the same as other
councils." Thip Is to be until the end of
the current year.
Golden Gate Council at Its meeting last
v r< k had a mock trial after the business
of the evening, and it was productive of a
Great deal of amusement.
Union Council at its meeting last week
Initiated two strangers and received six
applications, something that has not oc
curred In the council in years.
More improvements have been made
In the headquarters of the order at 850
Market street, where General Deputy
Wilson holds out. Gradually It Is being
fitted up as a first-class office in order to
meet the needs of increasing business.

BLANCHE PARTINGTON
What Shakespeare meant, here,
there, is almost as prolific of discus
sion as what God means. A Shaw,
now, most honorably labels his inten
tions â and saves thereby a peck of
trouble. Toa bad. it occurs to one this
week, that Mr. Shaw was not there to
suggest to Mr. Shakespeare that he
should preface "The Merchant of Ven
ice" with a dissertation upon his in
tentions as regards Shylock. Then
should we know as much about the
Jew as about John Tanner, nor have
Mansflelds and Glickmans and the rest
Quarreling about the cut of his Jew
ish gaberdine. Warrant for almost any
Interpretation of Shylock tiiat has been
presented â save that of a red-haired,
low comedian at one period In vogue â
. one can find in the text. It is simply
matter of accent. Miser above all,
Chylock was, as most agree, yet avar
, Ice, In the particular instance of his
â¢ relations with Antonio, is not his rul
ing passion. Thrice the amount of his
bend the Jew refuses, and Jessica tells
I, cs that she had heard him say:
"That he would rather have Antonio's
flesh
; Than twenty times the value of the
sum
I That he did owe him."
Tet to Tubal the Jew has said that
: were Antonio out of Venice "he could
make what merchandise he would"â
almost In the fashion of his exalted
(\u25a0descendant. Mr. Rockefeller. But not
: avarice but revenge rules Shylock
' here, and whether it be upon the very
natural desire to avenge himself upon
the man that had so often spat upon
his Jewish gaberdine, or upon the pa
triot desire for vengeance upon the
Christian who "hates our sacred na
tion" the larger accent is placed, is the
| determining factor in the quality of
the Shylock.
An audienc* that did not laugh wirh
Gratiano at the "A Daniel come to judg
ment"; an Antonio that in the court yard
scene went on his knees to the Shylock;
a Shylock whose revenge seemed mere
Justice to his interpreter, we have lately
had. Ellis T. Glickman and his Yiddish
company and their audience gave it to
ts and profoundly interesting it was. Not
the least interesting phase of the produc-
tion was a.n interpolated scene between
l Shylock and Jessica. Here, in Shyiock's
J^ I ouse. the Jew expiains to his daughter
his "lodgt-d hate" of the Christian. Years
before, his wife, LÂ«eah. returning home,
had been done to death by a party of
Christian gallants, during the carnival
excitement. From that time the Jew had
hated the Christian? and for that hate
wIH sacrifice his daughter's happiness â he
suspects her love for Lorenzo. There
were many other objects of interest in*
th~e production, a Portia who put on a
pair of spectacles and blonde wig as
disguise for the trial sc^ne among them.
But incidentally there was a Shylock of
commanding power in Ellis T. Glickman.
Perhaps the actor Invested the figure with
an unjustified nobility, but it was for the
moment powerfully plausible, wonderfully
appealing. In the detail, in the gamut of
Jewish gesture for example, Mr. Glick
tnan'fl Jew naturally possessed a unique
interest. His comment on the Manstield
I gesture is illuminative here. With hands
crossed upon his breast Mansfield stands
for a tense moment in the trial seene â "A
J<-w never do<s that," the Yiddish Shy
lock corr.menieU. But here are Mansfield
and Giickman themselves upon their con
ceptions of Shylock, evolved in a recent
correspondence in Chicago where both
\u25a0were in evidence. Por his' cameo of
hatred, a terrible jewel set upon the
breast of the year that the century shall
find it hard to match, for his utter resent
ment of sympathy for his Shy!ocÂ«v., vMans
field here gives reason. And for his de
mand for sympathy for the Jew of Ven
ice, for his beliefs in Shyiock's worth,
Glickman, the Jew. here for the Jew
i? peaks.
The Giickman letter is an open one to
a Chicago editor, and begins as follows:
"Shylock was not a miser. Yet when
Mansfield, Henry Irving and
Otis Skinner play the part they go
alwut with cringing shoulders and
with hands grasping at every article
of value. Not only do they make of
the character a demon .with a thirst
for blood, but they give him a charac
ter entirely different from what the
author intended.
"If Shylock had been a miser he would
have accepted the 30,000 ducats that
Bassanio offers him in lieu of the
pound of flesh.
"He was not a hero exactly, because
he was too exacting. He was a banker,
dignified, businesslike. But he had
been wronged, wronged many times,
and wronged by the man that owed him
the debt of flesh. He oetJeved. in the
light of all the wrongs that had been
done him, that he was merely obtain
ing Justice by demanding the pound of
flesh. He wanted justice.
"Shylcck has never been properly por
trayed. I mean to give Shylock as the
Jew knows him."
Further he says: Shylock "was not
suppliant, revengeful, cringing."
To this Mansfield makes the follow
ing reply:
"Mr. Glickman is entirely mistaken
concerning both Sir Henry Irving's in
terpretation of -the character of Shylock
and certainly concerning my own.
"Many have long held that Shylock
, was the one man, not to say gentle-
In the play. There is therefore
â¢ nothing new in Mr. Glickman's view of
the character, as he will discover if he
will take the pains to study his vario
rum. And Bulwer Lytton and * many
others have written at length on this
subject, Bulwer Lytton going so far as
to rewrite portions of the trial- scene
in accordance with his ideas.
"Shylock has not of late been played
by great artists as a 'scheming, shuf-
NEW NAMES IN ART THAT SHOW PROMISE
lieccnt art exhibitions hereabouts dem
onstrate two thingsâ that the big men,
with the single exception of Keith, are
not working seriously, and seeking to
bring out the best that Is In them. Work
ing only when they feel like itâ and by
come niggardliness of the gods many of
them don't often feel like itâ the world
Is cheated of many good things that
would add to its joy and to its spiritual
wealth. â ,
Then there is the other class of paint
ersâthe folk of the younger set (as we
Bay in society) who are working seriously,
and bringing out latent qualities and un
developed emotions that, like gold locked
In the bosom of earth, must.be dug for,
and milled and laboriously refined.
And it is just this workâ this Indomi-
SÂ»Ae. workâ that is bringing a lot of new
people to the iront.
There are those of the older and, to
day bigger men who hold a sneer for the
lessor fellowÂ»â and particularly for the
work of women. There are .those
who bold that there are no "promising"
fling, villainous money-grubber,' but
rather as a Jewish merchant of good
standing seeking a very natural re
venge. But Shakespeare himself en
tertained no such notion. Shakespeare
sought no sympathy from his audience
for Shyiock. ije desired Shylock to be
jeered at. laughed at and reviled, and
he wished Portia and Bassanio, Lo
renzo and Jessica, as well as Antoni?,
to have the interest and affection of the
audience-
Mansfield to some of his critics:
"Your dictum does, hot grieve me!
For wuerefore writeâ to say
That you no longer love meâ
So LONG a sermon, pray?
'Steen hundred lines, precisely,
I'm not afraid, not I;
They write far more concisely.
Who mean 'Your day's gone by.' "
r - vv â Apres Heine.
Needless to say, Mr. Mansfield did not
author the foregoingâ a vile word, "au
thor," "Polonius?â nor authorize. But
here is a Mansfield as little familiar.
Elsewhere The Call prints an exclusive
talk with the actor, but to an enticing
imitation to "say things" about his
"Don Carlos" â not, however, as he mis
takes in his note, in reply to criticism â
the actor gayly replies:
"Tuesday Evening. 7 o'clock.
"I have seen only The Call, so I can
give no opinion concerning the things I
ought not to have done or the things
that I left undone. And what DOES it
matter?
"No one can possibly condemn my act
ing more than I condemn it myselfâ BUT
I always do my best and I CAN do no
more v
"I certainly should not dream of find
ing fault with criticism, for I confess, I
was once a dramatic critic in Boston!
And I accept everything that comes to
me now as a Just retribution! Let young
people who write for papers take warn

upon the stage!

BOSTON'S VIEW
OF NANCE O'NEIL
The following "appreciation" of. Nance
O'Nell. just now being scattered broad
cast as prelude to her forthcoming en
gagement at the Grand Opera-house, is
of much ' interest to us. It is from the
Boston Transcript, the most weighty and
conservative of Boston's Journals, and
concerns Miss O'Nell's last year's en
gagement there. T~e combination of San
Francisco and the "Hub" against Gotham
âfor New York's rejection of Nance
O'Neil is- now a historyâ ls at least as
peculiar as it Is pleasing. One has long
ago found that for San Francisco to ap
prove play or player was almost suffi
cient for New York to condemn; more
so with Chicago; but to have Boston of
the company is too much honor. But
take heart. Boston; New York Is at pres
ent engaged in hysteric approval of the
new Clara Morris, Margaret Anglln, first
stamped as such in San Francisco. Pos
sibly they may in time learn to think
with us about Nance O'Neil, to tragedy,
to you and to us, what Margaret Anglin
is to the emotional drama. But here is
the Boston Transcript on the gifted Cali
fornian:
"The apparition' of Nance O'Neil on
the local stage has been the ' most
startling of theatrical events for years.
With such a name on posters only a
soubrette who sat on tables and swung
her neat stockings could be expected.
But here is a new Rachelâ an American
'tragedienne' who is a 'tragedienne'
appearing to us for the first time by way
of Australia, New Zealand and Europe,
and that without flare of trumpets either
preliminary or contemporary. Evidently
this heroic exemplar of American art be
lieves that real art needs no advance
agent. She has nevertheless managed to
reach 'the judicious few' who have dis
covered her, and holds /hem so far in
rapt and breathless suspense over her
tragic periods. Of stalwart height, with
graceful figure and mobile face, a nicely
modulated voice and the perfection- of
limb and statesque grace. Miss O'Neil has
the advantage of exemplifying in her per
son almost all of the physical desiderata
of great art, but the mental and spiritual
endowment is aulte as complete. Evi
dently, as far as natural endowment goes,
for the great of leading trage
dienne of her time. In English speaking
countries she has no rival. Nothing in
the way of training, either, seems to be
lacking. From her beautiful arm and
hand and most exquisite use of wrist and
the open fingers in gestureâ nobody since
Edwin Booth has displayed such hand
play. One could reconstruct all the fig
ures of the traditional poses, as given In
delsarte and the old French works for
the expression or heightening of all the
various passiGns and emotions. As with
the arm and hand, so with the whole su
perb figure, all of Its movements were
'express and admirable,' and yet its ar
rests of motion and its repose did the
most powerful work. At moments in the
dreadful Ibsen play she seemed a very
'Lachesis,' the fate that cuts the thread
of life as a matter of business: a sibyl, a
harpy in the Sudermann drama, the most
womanly and Intense of weak women,
gpert of a wild passion and sweeping
blindly over the precipice.
"All this is told not so much by action,
though that is interesting, vivid and beau
tiful, as by compelling power of person
ality, by magnetism, hypnotism, posses
sion by the very soul and feeling of the
character in hand. Nance O'Neil, Irish
though she may be, as is so much of
everything great in art in English speak-
painters among the newer set, as there
were in the early days of the School of
Design. But don't you believe themâ they
belong to the Ancient Order of Croakers,
who would rather dream of the past
than work in the present. And just take
this tip from me that there are men and
women in San Francisco with as much
promise now as there ever wasâ only the
standards are higher to-day than they
were hereabouts twenty years ago, and
the road seems longer because of it.. But
the serious, patient, thoughtful work - of
these newer peopleâ with their conscious
feeling and devoted study* of nature,
augurs well for the future art growth
of the West. \u25a0'

Of the symphony again. The following
explanation of the trombone efflorescence
In the "Tannhauser" overture will not be
unwelcome in this Polacco-less week. It
will be remembered that in the overture
at the blaring forth of the final theme,
Maestro Polacco astonished us with the
spectacle of the trombones risen upon
their hind legs, a la Sousa, the better to
blare. All wondered; some condemned.
But when it is explained that j not Po
lacco but Mr. Coiverd was responsible
for the innovation; that with a devotion
to the leader that could be expressed
only with a trombone at f f ff , and
then only standing, one can only wish
to the trombonist two trombones to blow
and four legs to stand on.
It is not beside the case that Polacco,re
gards our Mr. Coiverd as the best trom
bonist of his wide acquaintance.

Mile. -Emma Calve, like all other prima
donnas, has her own views upon the voice
and the art of singing, and is generally
not unwilling to share them.
She recounts that her education for the
stage was eminently a practical one, as
she was forced at the age of eighteen to
aid in providing a living for her fam
ily. She left her home at Aveyon in the
south of France to study in Paris, where
she received instruction from several fa
mous private masters, and then, with
little actual operatic experience to give
her courage, she went on the stage as
Marguerite in Gounod's "Faust" in Brus
sels. - :/<r
"I learned something at every perform
ance," she says. "The singer, whose
voice is so good and whose talents are so
ripe that she can prepare a role per
fectly for her first, or second, or even
her fiftieth performance does not exist.
Something may be added to a portrayal
each time it is repeated if one only will
study.
"I had to work hard and long before
I made my great success in 'Cavalleria
Rusticana' in London in 1892. But even
then there was more to de done, for the
art of singing, or rather operatic art, ris
advancing every day; formerly one had
just to sing, but nowadays the new operas
and the new lyrico-dramatic art make
greater demands upon the singer, both
vocally and dramatically, than- was ever
dreamed of In the old coloratura days,
and we must all keep pace with the times
or be left behind."
Mile. Calve was once asked how , she
attained her marvelous command .. over
the high and low notes of. her. voice, :how
it is that, in "Carmen,"; for Instance, she
is able to utter contralto chest tones of
exquisite beauty j and yet sing equally as
well the sometimes florid music of Mar
guerite In "Faust."
"Perhaps it. is because; l am a soprano
with a few good low tones,", replied she.
It was pointed out to Mile. Calve that the
low tones often have the velvet quality
of the real contralto. .
"In the old days these distinctions of
contralto, mezzo-contralto, mezzo-soprano,
the most Important event of the art
year.

to support. But .he quails before that
most cherished insignia of fashionable
femininityâ the low-necked dress. He has
vetoed discussion of the subject by the
Society for the Protection of Public Mo
rality. And why? Because, he frankly
states, "so long as their Majesties, the
King and Queen, expect low-necked
dresses at court, it is useless for any so
ciety to discuss the abolition- of the fash-
Ion." To the ordinary layman or lay
woman that reason seems to savor of
undue servility on the part of such a
doughty spiritual lordship to the powers
that be.
There have been bishops In the pa3t
who have dared to express opinions
that ran counter to royal notions, and
have encouraged others to do so and
have had their heads chopped off for
their temerity. Nowadays a blahop
would not even be deprived of his holy
see for allowing the freest scope to
discussion that might Involve criticism
of his or her Majesty. Far be it from
me to express an opinion on the deli
cate question of the relations between
morality and the generous display of
feminine charms which the decollete
dress demands. Queen Victoria, who
was a great stickler for morality,
would scarce permit one to appear iat
her drawing-rooms with neck and
shoulders covered even when armed
with a doctor's certificate. The Grand
Old Lady was the cause of my catch-
Ing a horrid cold once, but I bear her
no grudge on that account. Their pres
ent Majesties, I am glad to say, are
less stringent. It Is one of the multi
form . duties of the Lord Chamberlain
to define Just how low the "cut" should
come. Presumably he consults hia
feminine relations on the subject. But
I think that in the interests of art and
beauty scraggy women should be ex
empted even In royal drawing-rooms.

S Trias Clergyman Finds It Difficult Taak
to ' Marry Sweetheart to

GENEVA, Nov. 25. â A romantic scene
took place at the altar of the little
church of Claro, a village in the canton
of Tesseln. ; -
The curate, a young man named
Guetta, fell In love with a farmer's
daughter, but although his suit was
favored by the father, the girl repeat
edly refused the curate's offer of mar
riage, and subsequently she became en
gaged to seme one else.
The marriage day arrived, and the
curate was obliged to perform the cere
mony. When the bridal couple arrived
at the altar. Guetta lost control of his
feelings and passionately pleaded with
the girl not to take the irrevocable step
which would ruin his life.
At last Guetta,- realizing: his false po
sition, asked to be excused for a few
minutes, which he spent in prayer. Re
turning to the steps of tha altar he
performed the marriage ceremony in a
voice suppressed with emotion, -but
without breaking down.

Imagined that Dlckena* satire killed
Bumble, but they are mistaken. De
void of the savlngr grace of humor and
utterly impervious to ridicule, he still
flourishes in our midst and omits nt>
opportunity for self- glorification. He
has found his latest opportunity
in the completion by the Strand
Board of Guardians of a new work
house and casual ward In Lincoln's Inn
Fields, London. Such evidence of the
increase, of poverty and distress
scarcely seems an occasion for festivi
ty and rejoicing. But Bumble sees in
it the excuse for organizing one of
those pompous little hole-and-corner
deremonies in which his small soul de
lights. So. he has arranged a "formal
opening" with a procession, speech
making, refreshments, souvenirs con
taining his portraits and â ye gods! â a
gold key to open the door with. Think
of it! A gold key to unlock the door
of , ah institution which is to be filled

JUDGE MORROW
REJECTS LIND
R ef uses to Reinstate Alien
Who Obtained Citizenship
by Perjured, Statements
CHARACTER UNWORTHY
Norwegian Sailor May Never
Hope to Tread American
Decks Holding Authority
In unniistakablo terms United. States
Circuit Judge Morrow yesterday deliv
ered his opinion on the subject of the
100 frequent reinstatement to citizen
ship of aliens whose naturalization pa
pers had been canceled on the ground
of fraud and perjury by the applicant
and his witnesses: The case was that
of Pedar Albert Liud, a native of Nor
way, who became naturalized in 1899
in the' United States. District Court at
Seattle by means of perjured testimony
on the part of his two witnesses, who
swore that they had known Lind in
this country for five years, when, in
fact, they had known him for only.one
year. '\u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0 .: \u25a0\u25a0. .--'. I" \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0- '
These facts came to the notice of
United States Secret Service Agent
Helms about a month Â« r igo, and by
Helms' advice, in order to avoid prose
cution, Lind swore to an- affidavit re
citing the following facts: That he
came ..to. this port on. a foreign. ship at
the age of 18 years, and remained here
for one month, at the end of which
period he- re-embarked on the, same
vessel and for four years served under
a foreign flag on ships plying between
San Francisco and British Columbia.
On the occasion of his naturalization
in Mayj 1599, he made his declaration
of intention to become a. citizen, and
was. then formally naturalized by the
court as a minor upon hia own oath
and those of C. H. Davis and R. H.
Campbell, with the fall knowledge on
his and their part that those oaths
were false and perjured. Lind's natural
isation was canceled upon Lind's .af
fidavit and a. statement from Secret
Service Agent Helms. Lind applied to
Judge Morrow yesterday to be rein
stated to citizenship, he having been
a resident of the United States for five
years since the filing of his declara
tion of intention in 1899. ,
Judge Morrow bluntly denied the ap
plication and refused to make an
American citizen of Lind. Judge Mor
row said that among the qualifications
necessary for' naturalization, good
moral character was one of the most
essential; in fact, without it no man
was entitled to citizenship. It was
clear, continued the Judge, that Lind
was not a man of good moral char
acter, since he had fraudulently ob
tained his naturalization by perjured
testimony, knowing at the time that
his witnesses were swearing falsely.
Therefore he was unworthy of citizen
ship, concluded the Judge, and his ap
plication should be denied.
HanB Morthenson. another dishonest
mate whose papers had been canceled,
was held to answer yesterday by Unit

BOARDS DIFFER
ON CONTRACTS
Works Commissioners Refuse
to Accept Recommendation
of the !; School ; Directors
WANT A BID REJECTED
That for Sunnysicfe Building
in Excess of Allowance
v and Clash Delays Work
The Board of Education met yester
day. and. adopted a resolution recom
mending to the Board of .Works that
the contracts for the erection of the
\Vashlngton Grammar- and the Laguna
Honda school buildings be awarded' to',
the lowest responsible bidders. â¢ The
resolution also .recommends. that ;. all
bids submitted for the. construction of
the Sunnyside School be rejected be
cause the lowest bid, $61,000, is $7000
in excess of the funds allowed in the
bond issue, for the purpose. The . in
creased cost is said to be due to the
adoption of the mission style of archi
tecture. * ,
The resolution was immediately trans
mitted to the Board of Works, which,
also held a meeting, but declined. to ac
cept the recommendation of the Board
of Education that the bids for the Sun
nyside School- be rejected. . The Board
of Works expressed an opinion that it
would be-cheaper to award the contract
at - the Increased price than v to begin
proceedings all over again. It^ was
deemed more advisable to ' us"c" the
money which might be' saved on other
school buildings to make up, the de
ficiency. In this connection' it may be
stated that the estimate of the Laguna
Honda School was $81,000,' and as the
lowest bid was $54,000 a saving -of
$27,000 will bt) effected, on that build
ing alone. The Board of Works post
poned action on the recommendation
of the Board of Education for the three
schools named and the action Indicated
will serve merely to delay the erection
of the schoolhouses.
The Board of Education directed bids
to be invited for the' removal, of the
old Washington School building so the
ground will be cleared when the 'con
tract for the new structure will be
awarded.
An offer of a real estate firm to sell a
lot at the southwest corner of Grove

commodate pupils who are mentally de
ficient. As already published, it is pro
posed to place the. schoolhouse on a lot
belonging to the School Department on
Bush street, near Hyde. It is possible
the location may be changed, however.
Health Officer. Ragan notified the
Board of Education that the schools are
in need of fumigation,, owing to. the
prevalence among the pupils \of con
tagious diseases.. The board :ordered a
request sent' to the Supervisors to pro
vide fund 3 for the purpose, as there are
none available in the , regular appro

THE CRY FROM ALASKA.
THE proceedings of the Alaska Territorial Convention are a
revelation. In a general way most men knew that there were
many Americans in Alaska, but it was supposed, especially in
the East' that they were there for temporary purposes, attracted by
the mineral discoveries, or hoping to pick up some^valuable furs,
with the intention in either case of making a stake and returning to
the States. But it is disclosed in this convention that 60,000 Ameri
cans are in Alaska, and that the resources of the Territory are such
as to imply a permanent and increasing population.
The convention calls for the amendment and extension of Fed
eral mining laws and for a removal of restrictions upon railroads,
for an expansion of telegraph and mail facilities and for the con
struction of trails and wagon roads. All of these things mean the
permanent settlement of a country. A more useful judiciary is called
for, and the convention asks for proper and suitable public build
ings to house the increasing public business caused by rapid settle
ment and development of resources. Alaska flares up suddenly
across the northern sky like an aurora borealis, and all eyes are
turned to the new land of promise, sprung out of the tundra and
snow.
Alaska has been in possession of the United States since 1867.
The first administration was military, established in 1868. We have
impressed its affairs for the brief period of thirty-seven years. Rus
sia began her over-sea expansion toward this continent in 1728, when
that imperial genius and ruffian, Peter the Great, commissioned Vitus
Bering to follow up the discovery of the sea that bears his name by
looking for the land beyond. Bering's ships divided and discovered
the continent in 1741 at two widely separated points at about the
same time. Chirikoff, in command of the St. Paul, made "the coast
in latitude 55, and Bering found it in sight of Mount St. Elias and
anchored at Kayak Island. This made Alaska the property of
Russia by right of discovery.
The new land was promptly occupied by fur traders, and trading
posts and military stockades were built, and the land was Rus.sian
from 1741 to 1867, a period of 126 years. Then, apparently in the
belief that she had drained the land of its wealth and resources,
Russia sold it to us, bag and baggage, Indians, otters, fur seals,
salmon and all. It terminated Peter's ambitious plan of control of
the Pacific coast of North America. That plan named for us Rus
sian Hill in San Francisco and the Russian River in Sonoma County,
for the Czar's flag was once the symbol of jurisdiction over both.
Had we felt surer of ourselves we would now own a continuous
coast from San Diego to the Romanof Mountains. If we had adopt
ed for the Oregon boundary Ned Hannigan's deft of "54 degrees 40
minutes or fight" British Columbia would be inland and Esquimalt
would be our northern Gibraltar. But we were flying at the throat
of Mexico to make her let go her land north of the Rio Grande and
the Gila, and were not feeling strong enough to fight Great Britain
at the same time for possession of the coast line. Otherwise we
would now have the coast from Victoria to Port Simpson. Perhaps
some day we ma)- trade the Philippines to England for. all British
Columbia and so consolidate our continental domain.
The matter of interest just now is that Russia sold to us a pos
session that is probably more valuable than all Siberia. The Rus
sians did no more than tap the fur supply. In the 126 years of
her occupancy no roads were built and no facilities supplied for
inland communication. Indians were massacred or converted to
the orthodox church according as the soldier or the priest desired
praise and credit at home. The gold, coal, copper and tin were
trodden over by the Russian heel and their existence was unsus
pected. The vast forests made no suggestion to sluggish Russian
enterprise, and the frozen orange, supposed to be juiceless, has
dropped into our lap, for a consideration.
It is interesting always to speculate about, what history might
have been made by a slight change in position or lack of it. If
we had not bought Alaska in 1867 it would have been a Japanese
conquest in 1905, as was half of Saghalien Island, and to-day the in
scrutable subjects of the Mikado would be studying their ethno
logical relatives, the Eskimos, at close quarters. - But we took over
the estate and its resources thirty-seven* years too soon for this, and
in that time have made more development, found more resources,
taken more wealth out of Alaska than did Russia in a century, and a
quarter. The American habit of organization and self-government
has introduced order there. The people meet, elect a chairman and
pass resolutions. Already they have advanced so far as to have an
executive and a judiciary. Now they want a Legislature and a del
egate in Congress. After that comes the State of Alaska, saddling
the Arctic Circle, lit by the pole star, dividing the year into one day
and one night, and in sunshine or dark seething with American
enterprise.
One very interesting incident of the settlement and develop
ment is the considerable number of women who have entered the
Territory as mining prospectors and owners of business enterprises.
We look northward and shiver at the climate. But these American
women have made the trip from Dawson to Nome, have. hunted gold
on the shore and creek bars and under the tundra, have found it and
dug out fortunes, all the time enjoying the best of health. Un
consciously they have rendered the Territory a greater service than
strong men, for they have exorcised the fear that its climate was
intolerable.
THE movement in railway equipment is toward the disuse of
passenger cars constructed of wood.. The majority of the fa
talities in accidents on railroads are due to the splintering, crush
ing or burning of wooden cars. The Pullman cars, by reason of the
enormous quantity and strength of the wood used in their construc
tion, are the safest cars now in use. But their immense weight, nec
essary to their safety, is not feasible in the ordinary day car. The
roads are resorting to steel cars and it may be expected that all
American roads will finally be equipped with them, and wooden
" cars will be as unknown as are large wooden' frame buildings in
cities.
The first experiment with steel cars was in the freight equip
ment. Steel gondolas were made/in Pennsylvania for carrying coal.
Next steel box and stock cars appeared. In derailments and colli
sions it was found that these steel- cars were not telescoped nor
broken up. They held together and retained their form. From that
test came the suggestion of the steel passenger car, which will com
bine lightness, strength and safety.
This substitution of steel for wood in car building means an enor
mous drain upon the steel supply, and also the obsoleting of one
mechanical trade and the introduction of another. The mechanics
who build wooden cars will be out of a job and the construction of
steel cars will introduce a new trade.
If the result is greater safety in travel all the necessary sacri
fices will be justified. The railroads will economize by the change.
When a wooden car is broken, up in an accident it is gone, there
is no salvage. But the steel car. cannot be destroyed and all of its
metal Â£oe.s back to the shop for rerolling.'

IMPRESSIVE PICTURE OF MECCA
Mecca, tha sacred city of the Moham

Pilgrims to Mecca," an article trans

tbe December Everybody's:
"Mecca lies in a blistered valley among
the bare brown hills, a city filled to over
flowing with an ever-growing throng lof
the faithful gathered rrom all Islam. In
the teeming streets arriving, pilgrims, for
getful of all things save their desire to
reach the sacred gates, press by in fran
tic haste, heedless as to whom they jostle.
Noiseless, swaying camels surge through
the crowds as a ship sweeps through a
restless sea. Water carriers, laden with
their bloated goat skins, shriek their
wares into the tumult; close in the shad
ow of the walls of Haram, the great
mosque of Mecca, squat the public
scribes, each one surrounded by eager,
dark-skinned men awaiting their turn to
bridge the distance between .remote cor
ners of the world by the power , of the
scribe's ready pen. Pariah dogs roam in
packs through the streets, seeking what
they may devcur. Women, bundled be
yond all semblance of human, : forms

donkeys. Men and beasts are powdered
with gray, gritting dust tthat fills the

before we startedâ and there picked up
a dirty greaser by the name of Pedro
for a guide. 'Bucky' .kicked lika a wild
eteer when I engaged- him,; but I stuck
to it that he was all right and just the
man we were looking-for.. Ho claimed
to know all about the desert country,
so the next morning. our outfit started.
Besides our own horses â¢we had â¢ two
pack mules and we calculated that.we
were fixed for. at least a 'two. months'
trip. .'Bucky' insisted that' I was 'lo
coed' to hire the greaser, but the fel
low apparently knew his business, kept
his mouth shut and did his work. f We
had been out a week or thereabouts
when one night Pedro's actions aroused
my .suspicions. We had been skirting
the desert country nearly all; the way
and for the last two days had been
obliged to depend on our, canteens for
water. All through the day the greaser
had promised that we would find /fresh
water 'manana." When we camped that
night I concluded he had either lost his
way or was up to some deviltry, al
though I said nothing about it V" to
'Bucky.' "We all turned in right after
supper and I at once pretended to fall
Into a deep sleep. As usual, Pedro slept
near the horses in order to look 'after
them should . aythlng happen, and that
night I lay In such a position that I
could watch every move he : made. It
must have been 10 o'clock when I saw
Pedro raise his head and peer over In
our direction.
"Satisfying himself that we were
asleep, he got up quietly, saddled one
of the best horses and then came over
in a roundabout way ; to where 'Bucky'
lay. I hadn't the remotest idea of
what he was up to, yet common sense

THIS MAN POSSESSES $100,000,
YET HE LIVES ON 22 CENTS A DAY
"With $50,000 In the bank, and as much
more Invested in tax titles In Omaha,
Lincoln, Denver and, other cities, A. J.
Seaman, a well known resident of Omaha,
has reduced his living expenses to the
minimum, spending only 22 cents dally (or
board and room and less than $5 a year
for clothing;. Fashion in clothing his
room or table cuts no figure with the old
man. He has limited his board bill to 15
cents each day, and has maintained that
standard for many years. "And I guess
I sit along 'bout as well as any other fel
low," he says.
"I guess I live about as cheap as any
man in the United States." says Seaman.
"Any man can live on an economical basis
all right if he -will Just watch expenses.
"People have been lying about me. They
say I don't spend but 7 cents a day on
bread and meat and coffee and tea. It's
a lie. I spend 15 cents every day, and I
have not tasted coffee or .tea for nearly
thirty years. I don't mind people telling
the truth about me,, but I don't want no
lies."
Seaman is a tax title buyer and annual
ly makes a pilgrimage from Omaha
through Western cities, going as* fax as
Denver and Kansas City. He Invests
$50,000 in this business, and as fast as he
can dispose of a piece of property on
which he holds a claim he transfers his
money to new titles.
"I'm glad I ain't got no folks," says
Seaman. "Kin folks always want you to
help them out with a little money. I
ain't got any and I'm glad I ain't."
When the scavenger tax sales of Omaha
were going on Seaman was a close.at
tendant and a close buyer, but when the
sale was over the old man handed In a
check for more than $25,000, and the bank
cashed It without looking up his account.
"Do you see these shoes 7" said Seaman,
holding up a substantial boot. "I bought
'em at \u25a0 a second-hand store. Gave 50
cents for 'em. That was two years ago.
and I'll wear them for another year at
least. I don't throw away no money on
cobblers, either. When my shoes need
mending, I Just do it myself. I put this
sole on with a piece of leather and some
carpet tacka. But it's good, just the
same.

RAILROAD TIES FROM CORNSTALKS
One Inventor has come to : town with
something entirely new. He is J. T.
Schaffer of Kochester. known as an ex
pert on hydraulic machinery. He is also
an expert on induration, or the harden
ing of substances to make them both nre
and water proof, ana is well up on ex
tracting fluids from solids, says the New
York World. \u25a0
The Inventor's scheme Is to manufac
ture railroad ties out of cornstalks. He
has with him at the Victoria Hotel a
sample block or brick of his indurated
cornstalks, which Is as hard as a rock
and of a grayish color. There are in the
United States about 210.000 miles of sin
gle track railway, for which are required
500,000,000 wooden ties. The annual re
newal of ties is about 100,000,000. The
wood is giving out and Mr. Schaffer
would use pressed cornstalks as a substi
tute.
Having figured out the geographical re
lation of the roads to the corn belt, Mr.
Schaffer has decided to run his plant to
the railroads Instead, of distributing his
ties from a center. As a thrashing ma
chine travels about the country "setting
up" at farms where it is required, so this
Inventor Intends to draw his machinery
by locomotive to sidings along the corn
and sugar cane belts and turn out as
many ties as may be demanded. It would
require a train of four or five cars. About
twenty-five hands would be employed,

And the hat cost me another 10 cents, too.
I bought it from a man who had Just
bought a new hat. I saw Mm come out
of a hat store and I braced him and rot
his old hat. It's a pretty good fit. And
ho gave my dime to the clerk and told
him to buy a cigar with It. That's mighty
wasteful and that clerk never will be
worth anything unless he Quits smoking;.
"But say, I got a bargain In my sum
mer hat. Went down last winter and
bought a straw hat for 2 cents. Then I
put it away and when summer came I
was ready with my new straw hat."
Counting his entire -wardrobe. Seaman
was dressed in less than $2 worth of
clothing. HJBBJ
Seaman and a friend "bached" sev
eral years ago and at that time Sea
man - figured that he was spending
SI 20 a week for his meals. "That was
too, expensive, so I left that friend. It
costs me only $1 05 when I live alone."
he says.
Seaman frequently buys a loaf of
bread or a pie and takes It home with
him, where he eats It In his room.
"And r.ve got the coal trust beat all
to pieces," he says. "I don't U3e any
coal at all. I stay downtown until
bedtime. Then I go home and go right
to bed. "When I get up In the morning
and eat my bread and take a glass of
cold water, I get right' downtown. So
you see I haven't got the least use for
a fire. And that's how I beat the coal
trust."
Seaman Is a member of the Yoxvag
Men's Christian Association and spends
almost all his time in that building.
There he transacts all his business and
escapes paying 1 office rent. He is a de
vout student of the , Bible and In
younger days was a member of the
Congregational church. Now he is in
clined to scoff at sectarianism and
takes a broader view of the Bible's
teachings.

day of ten hours. "Oak ties." said Mr.
Schaffer. "cost Jl 33 in Northern New
York. The cornstalk substitute costs
one-third less. The latter will outlast
three wooden ties.
"All railroads soak their wooden ties in
creosote to lengthen their life," continued
Mr. Schaffer. "The objections to creosot
ing are that It does not prevent water
from soaking in between the spikes and
wood fiber. Again it Is very expensive,
and in the third place creosote Is a dead
ly poison.
"To the steel tie there are objections,
the noise and the lack of elasticity, which
prevents the tie from springing back into
place after the ends have dropped Into
the roadbed.
"The TVabash experimented with cement
ties, but It was necessary to Insert wood
en plugs Into which to drive the spikes,
and the water, swelling the plugs, burst
the cement. In Paris they tried ties

"THE FLORENCE OF LAXDOR,"
written by Lilian Whiting, author of
"The World Beautiful" and "The Life
liadiant," takes for its motto the above
Quotation. Florence Is so inspiring a
part of the world beautiful that the
author of this new book about that
great fountain place of art and. litera
ture has not hesitated to dower it with
the title of "The Flower of All Cities."
As to the application of the chosen
motto we may perceive it from some
remarks about Walter Savage Landor
on the last few pages of the volume.
before his death (the old man
was then nearly four score and ten>
be railed his attendant one night in the
small hours of the morning and asked
ler a pen. ifÂ« wrote a little poetry,
and then, leaning; back, said, "I shall
never write agatau Put out the light
Bad draw the curtains." So ho thought
liis poetic work was to cease, no doubt,
bat the author of the life radiant will
not have it so, and although he "had
tailed to lay hold otj immortality with
that abounding faith and exquisite cer- !
tainty of. recognition which Imparts to
life the glow and energy of achieve
ment and the joy that no man takcth
from another." she predicts that this i
"'loftier develop** raont of his noble in- ,
U'llfctual powers awaited him farther
on in the eternal progress."
It is of the time 1821 to 1564. when I
the Anglo-Florentine group, particular
ly Landor. helped to make themselves
iind the city of Florence groat by re
siding within it and winging their ef
forts with the spirit of the genius-en
riched environment that the book deals,
it was a period when the brightest
minds of the age visited Florence or
Â«rent there to live, as in the case of
the^ Brown in srs. In descanting on this
ccmtniE together of the stars in Flor
ence Lilian Whiting uses a quotation
from George Eliot: "Any. one watching
keenly the convergence of human lots
soes a slow preparation cf effects from
cne life on another, and which tells j
like a calculated irony on the indiffer- ;
rnce or the frozen stare with which we j
i look at our unintroduced neighbor,
W'.Vstiny stands by sarcastic with our
Qramatla porsonae folded in her hand.".
Then Miss Witting 1 goes on to say:
"Dosiiny stood by as Walter Savage
Landor entered Florence that April day
and saw the Canflpanilo. *a lily in stone,"
vising in thÂ«* Italian sky. and the Veiled
Figure. Destiny, held folded in her
hand the dramatis pcrsonae of that
wonderful Anglo-Florentine group who
were destined, during the Landor period
of IS2I -IÂ£â¬4, to leave a new impress
upon the romantic atmosphere of this
Flower of all Cities and City of. al!
Flowers."
The first chapter, called "The Flor
ence of Landor," introduces us swiftly
to the erratic grreatness of the poet and
to the glories of the city wherein he
loved to dwell. As to him. with all his
faults, we get most briefly to a Judg
infr.x. of him by accepting Margaret
Fullrr's expression about his "kernel
of nobJenoE!-" DPinr? always present. As
for the city, it's a chapter calculated
to start your enthusiasm freely flowing.
It Is rich in quotations; consider just
this one:
Of all the fairtn eitios cf the earth
None i? so lair aÂ« Florence.
Search within.
Without: ell '.<\u25a0 enrhantment! *Tis ihe past
<~onte-rvjinsr with the prt-srnt; and In turn
Earli l.as the mastery.
The second chapter describes the Villa
Landor. which lies on a picturesque hill
hide between Florence and Fiesole, and is
supposed to have been built by Michael
Angelo. It was presented to Landor by
one of hi? admirers. There Is a full page
picture of it with the surrounding gar
dens. It is of typical Italian architec
ture, with its white, severe simplicity and
its invitation to all the sunlight there is
\u25ba i come unobstructed upon its walls and
windows. Our Emerson visited him at
this villa, and thus speaks of him: "I
found him noble and courteous, living in
a cloud of pictures at his Villa Gherar
â¢iesca, a fine house c~Â«nmanding a beauti
ful lanc-fcC?;*?." Landor was a great ad
mirer of Southey. and pestered Emerson
with talk of him. Emerson irritatedly
asks: "But who is Southey?" In this
chapter there is also a description of
Yallombrosa, an eminence nearly SOOO feet
above Florence. It Is spoken of as the
â¢very A ready of the poet's imagination.
"It has the isolation of the dream world,
a realm in which reminiscence and vision
seem to meet."
In her chapter called "The Dew of
Parnassus," the author speaks of the In
ner circle of Florence, "with whom Par
nassus was familiar ground." It makes
known to us that to this oay the art and
scenic interests of Florence are only a
part of Its attractiveness, for it has a
society as remarkably fine as is the city
itself. It Is said to be a society of the
utmost accomplishment, including poets,
artists and thinkers. Its members are
linguists and are at home in three or
four of the modern languages: "they are
people who have seen and know the best
there is in the world â of society, art and
letters." ,
In the chapter called "Idyllic Hours in
Florentine Saunterings," there are ram
bling descriptions of the priceless speci
mens of art in the beautiful city, and
\u25ba "'â¢minlseent talk about the brilliant and
great people who have dwelt there. It is
here that Landor's appreciation of that
great Florentine, Savonarola, is men
tioned. It Is In one of the "Imaginary
Conversations" that Landor has repre
sented Savonarola as conversing with the
Prior of San Marco. It was originally
written In Italian. "In all Landor's lit
erary work nothing more Impressively
reveals the majesty of his spirit than this
work, nor has biography offered any in
terpretation of Savonarola that so abso- j
lutely penetrated Into his wonderful in- !
ncr life a.s has Landor In this sympathet- |
1c divination." He puts Into Savonarola's â¢
mouth at the time of his martyrdom these >
words: "My future is beginning in this |
piazza, I can yet look beyond it. â¢*â¢ *
I and my words may pass away, but nev- j
er will God's, however now neglected." I
It was the ambition of this great Domin
ican monk to make all art and learning
absolutely consecrated to the divine life,
and as he went to death through " the
flames he believed the torture but opened
to him fresh opportunity to achieve that
which he could not f ully accomplish on
earth. Here again we may note the apt
r.Â«?ss of the quotation used as motto for
the book. It^ recalls to mind that Saint
Dominic, the founder of the brotherhood
of monks to which Savonarola belonged,
had that same idea about continuing his
ck-Eigns after his body's burial.
"Xo work begun shall ever pause for
death.".
Another fine chapter of the book is
"The Dream of Rose Aylmer." It has
connection with a romance of Landor's
*Â£rly youth. RoiÂ«e Aylmer was a girl' of
7?" "with BThoxa he wandered among gar
den ro**es and In phady lanes." She was
thÂ« cirl who Â»ent him thu romance for
his first poem. Early, their paths divided.
She died at 20. - "Like a drain of ethereal
music" running as a molif through a
great symphony, so the dream of Rose
Aylmcr ran through all Landor's long
and varied experiences. A thing which
must have intensified the remembrance
of the romance of Rose Aylmer, and his
constant dreaming of her. Is the fact that
his marriage was far from a completely
happy one. His wife did not understand
nor sympathize with his genius, and it is
supposed that had he been mated with
a more congenial and inspiring woman
his life work would have been of much
hitjher quality and his achievements more
complete.
The two concluding chapters are "The
Imaginary Conversations" and "The
Twilight "of the Gcds."
All the interest of the beautifully writ
ten and finely illustrated book cannot be
even hinted at In this space, but for the
culminating matter to which it^ again
calls the world? attention let us take
Savonarola. There i^ a picture of the
1 great, eloquent and absolutely courageous
old monk holding aloft the crucifix. It
is taken from the colossal statue by Pazzi
in the Palazzo Vecchio. In speaking of this
great Florentine martyr his name natur
ally connects itself with that of the great
novelist, George Eliot, and one of her
mos-t fahious works, "Romola." Her
work is said to be a very vital interpreta
tion of him in all his passion of piety
and patriotism. George Eliot represents
him as thus speaking to Romola:
"The higher life begins for us, my
daughter, when we renounce our own
will to bow before a divine law. That
seems hard to you. It is the portal of
wisdom and freedom and blessedness.
And the symbol of it hangs Before you.
That wisdom is the religion of the cross.
And you stand aloof from It; you are a
pagan; you have been taught to say, 'I
am as the wise men who lived before the
Jew of Nazareth was crucified. 1 And that
is your wisdom: To be as the dead
whose eyes are closed and whose ear is
deaf to the wcrk of God that has been
since that time." * â¢ * "My be
loved daughter, sorrow has come to teach
you a new worship; the sign of it hangs
before you."-'
Among the last words of Savanarola to
his brethren gathered around him just
before his martyrdom were these:^
"My sons, in the presence of God. stand
ing before the Sacred Host, and with my
enemies already in the convent, I now
confirm ray doctrine. What I have said
came to me from God, and he Is my wit
ness in heaven thait what I say is true.
* * * My last admonition to you is
this: Let your arms be faith, patience
and prayer. â¢ A â¢ Of this I am
certain, that, dead, I shall be able to do
far more for you in heaven than, living,
I have ever had power to do for. you on
earth."'

NEW CREATIONS
IN PLANT LIFE
The art of plant breeding is believed
to have been brought to greater per
fection by Luther Burbank of Santa
Rosa, Cal., than by any other man,
living or dead. It has been said that
Burbank is overpraised. It would be
absurdly superfluous to overpraise a
man so long as the statement that 1 he
is the very foremost workman in so
great an art as that of plant improve
ment stands unchallenged. In the new
book giving an authoritative account
of the life- and work of Luther Bur
bank. written by W. S. Harwood, and
bearing the apt title of "New Crea
tions in Plant Life," we find in the
chapter called "His place in the world"
that the above stated general reputa
tion of the California genius is sus
tained on the high authority of David
Starr Jordan, president. of Leland Stan
ford University.
President Jordan's estimate is not
only authoritative because of his po
sition at the head of a great universi
ty, but also for the reason that his
scholarship is especially proficient as
a naturalist and an investigator \u25a0 of
the best that is known and thought in
the world about evolution. The nat
ural bent of his mind and the scope
of his research particularly qualify
him to pass judgment upon the
achievements of Burbank and~to com
pare his work with what has been
done and is being added to by experts
in the same line of endeavor the wide
world over. Jordan expresses Bur
bank's place in the world in these
words: "In his field of the application
of our knowledge of heredity, selection
and crossing to the development of
plants he stands unique in the world.
No one else, whatever his appliances,
Has done as much as Burbank .or dis
closed as much of the laws governing
the phenomena. â¢ â¢ â¢ His work is
already an inspiration to botanists as
well as horticulturists."
A further confirmation of this work
er's high place in "the world exists in
the fact that the Carnegie Institute
has endowed him with ten thousand a
year for ten years in recognition that
he is doing a great and worthy world
work. One of the principal objects of
that institution is: "To promote origi
nal research as one of the most im
portant of all subjects; to discover the
exceptional man and enable him to
make the work for which he seems es
pecially, designed his life work. Â£ â¢"
So in Burbank the Carnegie Institute
discovered the "exceptional man" in a
very important line of research, the
success of whom and of which is of
great value to humanity.
Care should be taken by enthusiastic
Californians not to spoil this high praise
by superfluous superlatives, which Mr.
Burbank would be the first to deprecate.
The potent possibilities of his discoveries
and creations arc magnificent, 'but at
present they are mainly potent possibili
ties and- have not as yet actually revolu
tionized the world. Millions of pounds of
prunes are eaten which are not Burbank's
prunes, and Ireland could exist even if
| the Burbank potato perished. Because he
: can at his wizard wish bring Into being
1 a blue rose, the white rose need not
) blush with shame nor the red rose pale
j with envy as though all their glory' was
I to be eclipsed because of gome grand new
blue era inaugurated by Burbank.
Whether he develops the daisies to a foot
and a half in circumference or more is
not so momentous, for there will always
be people who love the little daisies and
tome few who may thijik it Is the heredi
tary duty of the daisy to-.be modestly
and unobtrusively small, '"falio has not
beheld some rose of cabbage bigness and ,
longed by contrast to caress some- lovely,
delicate little one more daintily, petite?
This semi-creative power of genius -Bur
bank is something ; to marvel at, and
something for the development of which
he deserves applauseful credit, but as to
the sweeping benefits to humanity of the
whole long list of creations ' we } must
await the test- '-of time.; \He himself,
emulating and copying on a , magnificent
scale the processes, of natural evolution
out of the million plants that ho pro
duces, ..'ruthlessly... eliminates -all but the
one elected millionth; and we must ever
remember that there are vastly other
evolutionary forces busy eliminating mil
lions of things and electing just ;*a- ; few
to permanently live in the struggle; for
existence and â¢ the survival -of * tho fittest. ,
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SUNDAY, NOVEMBER 2Â»V 1905.
What becomes of the Burbank aerial
Irish potato if ho of Erin and all his scat
tered kin in blood and palate think that
the ones that grow under ground are just
as good? Perhaps by all odds the thing
of biggest promise on the long Burbank
list is the thornless edible cactus. The
thorough success of that would indeed
revolutionize the world in a way. It
would even make race suicide wholly un
necessary for centuries to come, and
make the great reclamation' act of the
United State's Government seem an insig
nificantly small matter by comparison.
Howevgr, if perchance it be not the in
tention of nature to utterly eliminate the
deserts from the face of the earth, then
the edible cactus is destined to nothing
much but "its brief prediction period. This
is not mentioned merely to try to belittle
Mr. Burbank's wbrk; that would' be fu
tile and foolish, for. Burbank is great. It
is only saying that man proposes and God
disnoses. I
The subject of that thornless cactus
Is an arousing theme. The
glory of the promise of it, the immensity
of the figures of new prosperity it sug
gests as possible, the arousing of the
imagination to delight hopefully in the
poetic prophecies of Isaiah about the
conquest of the desert places of the
earth and the making of them to blossom
with fruitfulness and beauty. Some one
has said â Ferguson, in the . "Religion of
Democracy." is it not?â that tho truly
great prophet is he who strongly sees to
It that the thing prophesied 'really comes
to pass. .Let us Californians allow our
selves tto gush and glowy over Burbank
enough to hope and half expect that he
will prove one of , those strong prophets
who can compel by his genius what he
predicts to come to .pass. That he is . a
man thoroughly, leavened with the . relig
ion of democracy mo one who reads of
his life and work can * for an v Instant
doubt. If '< it seem a wild dream when
we are in our more matter-of-fact moods,
we must remember that every great
achievement was first a dreamâ a thing
that seemed to come half hesitatingly
out from chaos into tarfgible and pos
sessable form. If the thornless cactus
achieves but a tiny fraction of its promise
it will be a very great victory for human
ity in compelling nature to serve its
needs; and the same can be said of the
sum total of Burbank's life work.
To close I will quote .you a few words
from this man who has known what the
strenuous life means^even to the extent
of semi-starvation, who in privation
bravely borne, has been "hard by the
gates of. death,"" and; yet. persisted j with
a heart eff "perdurable toughness" to the
far-accomplishment of his purpose:'. ,
"The greatest happiness' in the world is
to make others happy; the : next is to
make thÂ«m \u25a0. think." ' .

hire." , - ""' ."\u25a0\u25a0;\u25a0 \u25a0â¢;\u25a0.-\u25a0\u25a0 Â£.â¢\u25a0?Â£/ \u25a0 vi.

'\u25a0\u25a0'" 'A woman's crowning glory is her

UNIVERSITY STUDENTS -SHOW
DISLIKE FOR KINGDON GOULD
Blackball Him When His Name Comes
, Cp for Election Before a Col- '~~-X\
lejre Society.
NEW YORK, Nov. 25. â Kingdon
Gould, George J. Gould's son. was
blackballed last night when his name
came up for election before the King's
Crown, a society to which every stu
dent in Columbia University is eligi
ble. Sixty-four young men were voted
on at the meeting and young Gould
alone failed of election. Fourteen men
voted against his admission, and five
such voles were enough to keep him
out.
"Klngdon Gould shot at, or over,
some 'sophs' who wanted to take him
perhaps rather forcibly to their ban
quet last year," said a student "This
year President Butler announces in his
report that hazing is not and will not
be permitted in any form at any time
or under, any circumstances. We have
to thank Gould for that."
"You are talking through your hat."
said another- student. "Gould was
blackballed because he is too Infernal
ly rich and wears a kangaroo walk, a
long-tailed overcoat, suede gloves and
a walking stick"." ?
"Kingdon Gould is a good fellow,'"
chimed in: a third. _"It is not his fault
he's rich. It's his grandfather's. Any
how he is doing his best to spend his
granddaddy's. money. Didn't he give
$600 so the freshmen could buy ; a shell
in" which" they rowed' Yale?" "

Mr. and Mrs. Laurance I. Scott and Charles
T. Crocker of San Francisco Injured.
Young Wife of Former Congressman Is
Crushed to Death Under Machine.
KEW YORK. Nov. 25.â Mrs. Francis
Burton Harrison, wife of former Con
Â£Tessnnan Francis Burton Harrison of
New York, was killed to-day by the over
turning of an automobile in which she
was riding with a party of friends from
' Ean Francisco. The car was running
up a grade in Long- Island City, when the
bursting of a tire or a break in the steer-
Ing gear caused the accident.
Mr. and Mrs. Laurance L Scott of San
Francisco and Charles T. Crocker, also
of San Francisco, a Yale student and a
brother of Mrs. Harrison, were injured.
A Mr. Scott suffered a fractured rib and is
!n a serious condition. His wife was ren
dered Unconscious, but later was revived.
Mr. Crocker was bruised and the chauf
fÂ«ur Eligrhtly hurt. Mrs. Harrison's neck
was broken.
Mrs. Harrison was Miss Mary Crocker,
daughter of the late Charles F. Crocker
of San Francisco. She was one of three
children who divided the fortune of be
tween 512.000.000 and $15,000,000 left by her
father. Her husband. Francis Burton
Harrison, is the son of Mrs. Burton N.
Harrison, the novelist, and Burton N.
Harrison, who was secretary to President
Jefferson Davis of the Southern Confed
eracy during the civil war. Mr. Scott is
a son of the late Irving M. Scott, the
San Francisco shipbuilder.
WHIRLS IXTO THB DITCH.
To-day's automobile ride was part of
11 re. Harrison's programme In. entertain
ing Mr. and Mrs. Scott, who are intimate
friends of the Crocker family, and who
came here recently on a visit. The party
were riding from New York to Henip
eiead Colony, L. 1., and It was about
noon when the accident occurred- Mrs.
Scott told the details of how thÂ«* merry
part;-, in the midst of laughter from
Mrs. Harrison, were, without warning,
wheeled sharply from the road and
thrown into .a ditch, two of them ren
dered unconscious and pinned under the
heavy machine.
The automobile had just started up
what is known as Thompson's hill. This
place is a favorite speedway for automo
biles. As the car began to glide swiftly
down, Mr. Scott and Mr. Crocker were
examining a road map. while Mrs. Har
rison and Mrs. Scott were talking to
gether and laughing. The chauffeur, Mrs.
_ Scott said afterward, turned about In his
scat and remarked that something was
wrong with the steering 1 gear. > \u25a0
The next instant the machine swerved
sharply. The chauffeur's frantic efforts
to guide it back into the road were fruit
less and the car plunged toward a ditch
at the side of the road, with a telegraph
pole looming up directly In its course. It
Flruck the pole a glancing blow and then
toppled into the ditch.
VICTIM PrxXED DOWN.
Mrs. Harrison was thrown under the
automobile, her head pinned down by
the heavy machine. She was unconscious
a:i(J it was afterward found that her neck
had been broken. Beside her, also pinned
<iowr. by the car. was her brother, but
ho waÂ» not severely injured and was able
to free himself from the car.
The triree others, Mrs. Scott. Mr. Scott
and the chauffeur had been thrown clear
of the machine. Mrs. Scott was hurled
across the ditch, landing ten feet beyond
the car. and lay unconscious where she
fell. Her husband, although still con
scious, was unable to move for some
lime. The chauffeur, like the other mem
bers of the party, was stunned.
No one was near the point where the
accident occurred, the road being almost
deserted at the time.
The first persons to realize the terrible
situation were Mr. Crocker and the
chauffeur, who tried to free Mrs. Har
rison and found that they could not lift I
the machine. Mr. Scott, with a broken i
. rib, also Joined them, but still the ma- !
"-.in* pressed upon the unconscious worn- j
f an. Mrs. Scott had by this time been!
restored to consciousness, and It .was de- i
cidc-d to send for help. |
I'AHMHA.VDS RAISE THE MACHINE.
Assistance, however, was already com- '
Ing. two farmhands having seen the ac- j
cidect and ran across the fields. Another
automobile came along at>out the same
time and the men were able to raise
the machine.
Mrs. Harrison was dying when her
friends lifted her up. She was hurried to
St. John's Hospital In Liong Island City,
but died before reaching - the hospital.
J*atcr an ambulance was sent for Mr.
and Mrs. Scott, who. after treatment at
the same hospital, were able to. return
to New York In a carriage.
Mr. Harrison was at his office in New
York when first informed of ; the accident
and was told that his wife had been'se
verely Injured. He did not know, of her
death until be called at -St. John's Hoe-
Mr, and Mrs. Harrison were married
in 1930- At the last gubernatorial election

This was the second accident In which
Crocker was injured. Several years ago,
while speeding an automobile in Califor
nia, he c&lKded with a bridge support
and was taken out of the wreck with
both lees fractured.
Mrs. Harrison was regarded as one of
the best automobillsts among the women
of her set. Frequently .she 'drove her
brother's forty-horseptfwer car at high
speed, acting as her own chauffeur.
Mr. Gallagher, proprietor of the garage
where the Harrison automobile was kept,
s&id i
"The center of the boulevard where the
machine upset is a macadam, road thirty
feet wide. On either side is: an asphalt
cycle path, and beyond that a stretch' of
sand twelve feet wide. The chauffeur
was running the automobile partly on the
cycle path. The tire on the front right
wheel exploded; causing: the wheel to
sag about four inches. This swerved the
machine to the right and it darted over
the cycle path into the stretch of sand.
It forged- aheadrfor 16S . f^et. oven after
the tire burst, finally, striking the tele

fused to be comforted. His secretary. A.-
O. Thaycr, visited St. John's 'Hospital
this afternon, where the body of Mrs.
Harrison was at first laUon: and found
the brilliant young lawyer racked by
unutterable woe. He 'refused to ipjeak
to anybody," and continually paced the
room by the side of " the mangled re
mains of his wife.
Mrs. Irving M. Scott, at the Ariinston
Hotel, where she and her 'son laurance
have been stepping since their arrival
from San Francisco, Js I prostrated as a
result of the tragedy. ' l
Mr. and Mrs. Ldurance Scott had their
injuries dressed in St. John's Hospital by
Dr. Briggs. It was found that Mr. Scott
had received a fracture "of the ninth rib,
and possibly Internal injuries, while' his
wife had^escaped with a few bruises.
There are two explanations of the cause
of the accident, one made by the police
and Coroner and the other by E. B. Gal
lagher, Importer of Richard-Brasicr au
tomobiles. The -police and Coroner said
to-night that the loss of control of the
car was due to the dropping cvt ofa
ball-bearing part at the joint where the
rod from the steering wheel connects
with the steering rod beneath the body
of the car. Whether this was due to one
of those Inexplicable accidents that oc
cur to all automobiles or to gross care
lessness, they could not decide.
Gallagher, after questioning the
chauffeur and examining: the machine,
declared that an exploding tire on the
right front wheel swerved the auto
mobile Into deep sand, where it could
not be guided. Only one explanation
was offered as to why a car \u25a0 should
travel 168 feet In that condition, .and
this was - that the â¢ chauffeur became
confused and did not shut off his power
or apply his brakes. Agralnst this Is
the vehement denial of the man him
self, who admits he jumped Justjbefore
the accident.
The direct cause. of the automobile
upsetting was the striking of, a tele
graph pole by. the' front wheel Justat
a moment when the men were either
endeavoring- to. drag, the women from
the machine to escape 1 the Inevitable
accident or." to Jump. Because of: this
accident Mrs. Scott, who occupied .an
outside, place, 1 was thrown free, but
there was no chance to save Mrs. Har
rison.

intense pain after she had taken the very first dose '
' of Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey.
â¢ MISS SUSIE JOHN COTTON.
To thoroughly appreciate the extraordinary healing powers of Duffy's Pure
Malt Whiskey, read what Miss Cotton says in her letter:
"Very recently I was taken ill on a train with what proved to be pneu-
monia; so seriously ill as to attract the attention of my fellow passengers,
among whom was the Rev. A. N. Stephens, D. IX. of Oakland, Term.
"At the next station he procured me a bottle of Duffy's Malt Whiskey, and
I am glad to say that the very first dose brought comfort and alleviation from
my intense r>uin. I continued to take the medicine and rapidly recovered my
former g"ood health. I think the cure in my case is well nigh a miracle." â
MISS S. J. COTTON, Jackson, Term., July 14, 1305.

COLORED BISHOP MAKES
"V ; ' ATTACK UPOX GOVERNMENT
MACON, Ga., Nov. 25.â Bishop Henry
M. Turner, a leading: bishop in the Amer
ican Methodist Church, made an impas
sioned attack upon the Government and
the United States Supreme Court 'in his
annual address to the MacOn conference
in session here. He declared that no man
hates the nation more than he does,
and he referred to the United States
Supreme Court as a damnable institution
which has deprived the negro of every
vcstJse of human or manhood rights.
In concludins his address he stirred his
auditors to a high pitch of, excitement
by shouting: "I am not pleased with this
nation. No man hates this nation more
than I do. The negro will never be any
thing in this country but scullion until
he shows his manhood, uo to Africa
and build up a great nation that will
command the respect of the civilized
world. We could organize and agitate and
pay men to stay at Washington and
plead for the cutting down of the South
ern representation, while the South is
pleading for our disfranchisement and
much good could be accomplished. But
the negro Is a miserable coward. He just
stays here and preaches 'Heaven up yon
der and hell down yonder,' and says 'wait
on the Lord.* "

machine went over. We could not see
how she was caught at first, but Allen
and I both started on a run.

ing himself on his hands and looking
at the machine. The chauffeur was
over at the side of the road, oh his feet,
but dazed. We spoke to him, but he
could not understand us, only pointing
at the machine, and then we saw un
derneath a woman's hat, just over the
edge of the rear seat. That was Mrs.
Harrison. -
DEAD WHEN DRAGGED OUT. .
, "AJlen and I and the chauffeur, who
was too much hurt to do much lifting,
ran over and lifted the side of the ma
chine a little, â¢ Then the other man,
Mr. Scott, came over and. though he
was pale and hardly able to stand, he
helped to drag her' out from under the
machine. She did not move. It does
not seem tome that she ever breathed
after we saw her; : but Mr." Scott . kept
saying: 'We must get her out and get
a doctor quick.' .'
"Another man. a driver, came up, and
he helped, too. By that ; time, Mr*.
Scott had revived and was sitting up,
and just then Mr.' Domlnick's - automo

inick jumped out with his chauffeur,
and they began to' lift Mr. and Mrs.
Scott Into tho machine and then we
three carried the woman's body over.
We told him where to go and the ma
chine darted away. Policeman. Steoul
came up then and took-* charge. We
dragged (he automobile out to the side
of the road and then we saw that : 'the

had started down the road, crying and
waving his hands. We thought ho wan
going -to the hospital, but he did. not

Young Crocker .was afterward found
still running In Jackson avenue, near

at once to^the .Harrison home.' after

was in his office down town.

he said, "and was going^up the hill
slowly, when ;-I : ; heard ? : tlie f automobile
coming behind mel."^ I*drew i; out. and X
passed me.' It v was 'going; very fast.
They had not gono a hundred feet/ it
seemed, when the machine began' to go
off to the right. I heard the chauffeur
shout something and then? the .women
screamed. The men got up and grasped
the women as if they were going to
throw; them out and . the chauffeur
Jumped. Just ot that time the machine
struck the polo and they all .went \u25a0 out
together. It's a wonder to. me' they all
did not have their necks broken. THey
all lay still for a little while when they
struck, and the wheels of the automo
bile kept on going for a minute. \u25a0 .'
"I got there as . soon" as I could and
about, the' time â the other^"men* did. \u25a0\u25a0?\u25a0'. I
tried !to find but something-, t rum ; the
chauffeur, but he -"could ' only- talk

the automobile. AH of us â¢ then went
over and I', saw -the bat- sticking -out
from underneath" the," back '\u25a0 seac.-^ I

then the" otherl.; automobile took * tho

AMERICAN GIRL
NOW A PEERESS
LONDON. Nov. 23.â Through the death
of the aged Lord Leigh, an American
woman has become a peeress and has
been installed as mistress of Stoneleigh
Abbey, the magnificent country- seat of
the Leighs. There she will share with
the Countess of Warwick the* position
of leading hostess of .Shakespeare's
county. Before her marriage, fifteen
years ago, to the Hon. Francis Dudley
Leigh, who has "succeeded to the title
and estates, she was Miss Helene Forbes
Beckwitb, daughter of the late N. M.
Beckwith of New York. Besides being
a charming woman with all the wit, vi
vacity and adaptability that are charac
teristic of Columbia's fair daughters, she
has two recc^nized claims to social pre
eminence. She is one of the best dressed
women in England and she has some
amazingly fine jewelry. It was she who
started the fashion of wearing an all
round jewelled crown â a fashion which
possesses the supreme merit of being
strictly limited to those who can "make
good" In hard cash.
Stoneleigh Abbey is situated near Ken
ilworth, which Sir Walter Scott made
immortal. It stands on the site of an
abbey built by Henry II for a congrega
tion of Cistercian monks. Henry VIII.
who quarreled with the Pope because
pontifical notions of matrimonial obliga
tions would not permit him quite as
many wives as he wanted, took the prop
erty from the monks and bestowed It on
the Duke of Suffolk. During the six
teenth century it passed into the hands
cf Sir Thomas Leigh, who was a Lord
Mayor of London when Lord Mayors
were really elected. The present man
sion, which was erected in the early
part of the eighteenth century, at first
consisted of a long and imposing range
of buildings in the Corinthian style. Since
Its erection It has undergone numerous
alterations and Is now one of the finest
country seata In the kingdom. The .vari
ous apartments contain costly pictures
and statuary. Including works by Van
dyke, Rembrandt. Holbein, Guido, Ten
lera, Lely, Gainsborough and De Wit.
Among them Is a fine portrait by Van
dyke of Charles I, who stayed at Stone
leigh during the last years of bis reign.
There are also specimens of the sculp
ture of Canova, Bartoleni and Ballly. ; A
feature of the mansion Is a beautiful
private chapel which has' an altar piece
of Carrara marble and pictures of the
Crucifixion by Albert Durer and the Vir-
Cln and child by Perugino. In front of
the abbey Is a superb Italian garden
which was laid out by Baron Chandos
Leigh, father of the late Baron. . .
The new Lord Leigh is 51 years old.
For some years he acted as assistant nec :
retary to Viscount Cross when he ' was
in charge of the India office. He is now
a member of the London County" Council,
where, according to Lord Rosebery, a
man j can do far more \u25a0 useful ' work than
in Parliament.

Continued from Page 25, Column 7.
ment issued by the Admiralty to-night,
declaring that the sailors and several
units of troops' were ; assembling under
the direct supervision of the : Socialist
propaganda. The statement , follows: :
"The events at Kronstadt have found
echo in the Black Sea fleet. Vice Ad
miral Chouknin reports that sailors, un
der the influence of . the \ Socialistic
propaganda, have organized at Sebasto
pol a series of demonstrations. The
movement has < spread to several bV
ganizations'^of the army. Viee r Admiral
Pisarevski was seriously wounded
while trying to prevent a meeting ber
ing held.- The situation is serious,
though, according to a report received,
at 6:27 o'clock this' evening, v no ' at
tempts had been made :to pillage."*
The -revolutionary ferment, in spite
of the effort* of the . officers, is knovrn
to have affected n portion of the j en
listed men of many regiments and the
Sebnstopol jmitlny may be j the spark
that is necexsary to tict in flame a
widespread revolt.' ...
A dispatch from Sebastopol says that
the condition of Rear Admiral Pisarev
ski, who' was wounded Friday by the
mutineers, is critical. It is not known
whether the men attacked other offi
cers.
The outbreak at Sebastopol^compli
cates the problem of the Government
for dealing with the agrarian .situa
tion. These disorders are growing and
the Governors of five provinces' have
sent representations to the Government
that the troops available j are \u25a0 insuffi
cient to restore order and urgently ap
pealing for reinforcements, and there
fore it is not easy to organize a force
to be dispatched to the relief of Se
bastopol. - The â¢ Cossack battalions
which are now being mobilized in the
Don province will apparently be need
ed in the home districts to preserve
order. - . "t'.'X-' - "
ODESSA, Nov. 25.â Troops have been
sent from here to quell the disorders
at Sebastopol, which are reported to be
increasing. The mutineers have sent
the ' chief admiral a black 'coffin, and
have demanded that he leave the*- town
Immediately. Railway traffic with Se
bastopol is interrupted.
MUTIXEKRS MAY RULE FLEET.
DinpatcheM Fall to Reveal Extent of
the Scbamtopol Outbreak. .
ST. PETERSBURG. Nov. 25.â 1n view
of the alarming news received to-day of
a mutiny at Sebastopol, the proceedings
of the Zemstvo Congress at Moscow and
other developments In the Russian situa
tion paled into insignificance. The for
midable revolt in, which sailors of the
fleet, shore equipages and'lnfantry garri
sons" are participating appears at the
present to be beyond the power of Vice
Admiral Chouknin. commander of the
Bleack Sea fleet. # to control, as the dis^
patches say, nothing of Counter measures
being taken, or of the attitude of, the
other regiments of the regular garrison.
The ' mutineers and . riotous' strikers are
parading the city with red flags without
Interference, and it may be possible, as
was the case. at Odessa,, that the, guns. of
the battleship Pateleimon (formerly the
Kniaz Potemklne) and other vessels of
the Euxlne fleet dominate the situation
and prevent active measures being taken
to quell the mutiny* even if Vice Admiral
Chouknin has sufficient loyal troops' at his
disposal. *.: \. *.â¢ \u25a0:'-'\u25a0
The dispatches say" nothing as to the
reasons for the mutiny or of the demands
of the mutineers and no details are ob
tainable at the Admiralty, though the
conjecture Is advanced that demands for
better food- and the release of reservists
'might partly be responsible for it. The
lack of good officers is frankly. given by
one of the highest officers of the naval
staff as the principal and' underlying rea
son for the' alarming conditions In; the
Euxine fleet. As at Cronstadt, practically
all the good officers were drafted for
service with the fleets in the Far East
durlns the war and the force of com
manding officers at Sebastopol Is now
only about one officer . to over, 400 men
and many of these are utterly Incapable.
The revolt of the Brest resriment is one
of the most serious features "of the situa
tion. It~ls the first time an Infantry
regiment as a whole has mutinied and
the question on the lips of'every, orfe in
the capital Is: How long .will- It be before
it Is followed by others, perhaps even
the St. Petersburg garrison? j

'American-* Secretary of State! while fin
office', has ever done. The, ostensible pur-
pose of his trip is to attend the congress
of American republics when it i meets
there. But his object, as events -will
show, is not to be a spectator at the con
gress. He has a definite, comprehensive
policy, to work : out toward which the ' re
cent secret mission to Brazif of Solicitor
Penfleld . has been part.' Penfield went
there to' make;. an .investigation prelimi
nary -to the development 'of \u25a0 Secretary
Root's policy of better commercial rela
tions under a more clearly defined money
doctrine. , The Roosevelt : ; administration
is at work upon two 'great - lines of pol
icyâone domestic, \ the , other," foreign, j_/
The, great national need "[ as President
Roosevelt and his advisers: view the-ex
isting situation is a better safeguarding
of industrial rights against the great, cor
porations which i are filling 1 so ;iarge a
place in the Industrial life of to-day.
Events are moving toward national: con
trol of corporations, somewhat along the
line of Commissioner . Garfleld's resolu
tion, after'his study of corporation ques-.
tions.' " \u25a0 .:..' \h,.~: i .\u25a0\u25a0.:'"
._ No , sweeping change will be accom
plished at once, or even' made by. the
President, but the" first step 'and \u0084 one
which conditions make immediately avail
able relates: to railroads. That will, ac
cordingly, be the chief resolution in the
President's forthcoming message. '\u25a0-:
AUTO CHANGES
ENGLISH PEER
LONDON. Nov. 25.â Never, probably,
has the ; possession of a motor- car
wrought a more striking change in v it3:
owner than that which has lately been
apparent in the Earl of Portsmouth.
Ever since' he cams out of Oxford . his
lordship has been known as .that -rare
thing, a peer with evangelical tenden
cies. Imbued also with certain socialis
tic' leanings, sport of any kind seemed
completely out of his line, and if^there
was one law-abiding citizen 'in the â¢ land
it certainly was he. \u25a0'. v^' ' ; . >;
Just how the Earl came to' acquire. a
motor, car has * ' riot developed, 7 but --'\u25a0 it
seems to have turned Jekyll into. Hyde;
so ; far as 'he is concerned. " The "Earl has
suddenly : becom'e^'no.' end,; of;ra.^''scgrch
er,v 5 and to talk to him about the police
is like waving a red ' flag at". a . bull. He'
\u25a0got Himself^intb' the' papers' recently by.
posting up a warning to r 'other ;..; motorists
near a well-known ./, trap'.' [on the
borders of his Hurstbourne Park: estate,
and he is one of the leading of
the newly' formed Automobile*/ Associa
tion, whose avowed mission it Is to' fight
the rural authorities who persecute \ car
owners. â¢ Other \ distinguished . members of
the association are Sir Arthur J Conan
Doyle, : who has , twice been mulcted ,- in
heavy fines, and the Hon. Stephen , Cole
ridge, who recently wrote : that while mo
toring in the , Andover _ road he >'f ell
among magistrates," thus \ paraphrasing
the Bible anecdote. . \
The Earl of Portsmouth, who is also
Viscount Lymington. and Baron Wollop,
is 49, 'and one â¢ of the richest '\u25a0 men in his
section of the countryâ Hampshire." - His
estate there- comprises 47,000^ acres,,' and
besides Hurstbourne Park | house,, he , has
a big town fmansion |in j Westminster," and
another country residence "; in North Dev
onshire. .One |of his : ancestors :was Vice
Treasurer of Ireland under Elizabeth, and
another sat to try Charles I, but de
clmed to sign the monarch's death war
rant. . '. -; ; .' . \u25a0 .\u25a0':: \u25a0--â¢ :':.' ," \u25a0 â¢':- \u25a0:'\u25a0
Now that. the Earl has caught the mo
toring , craze he reminds " one more of { his
father,; the ' late -Earl, who^" was famous
as a dare-devil huntsman and owned the
finest pack of hounds in Hampshire. Even
in his carriage he always drove at break
neck speed. - In London he; was- the. ter
ror of the /babbles, who ; could never go
fast' enough to suit him. \u25a0\u25a0 One day, how
ever, the Earl met a jehu who was
rather more . than his . match. He -was
driving down^ Piccadilly : in a . hansom
when the ' street became badly blocked.
The cab stopped, whereupon the ' noble
man became wrathy. and demanded to Ibe
hurried forward at once.' I, The f driver
pointed' out that" the street' was Impassa
ble. "Rubbish,": man, ; \u25a0 clear-the ; road,"
cried his lordship. "I'm the }-\u25a0 Earl of
Portsmouth!" ;"Ifs no -^ood, ; sir.",: re- 1

by d'Eresby and Miss Eloise Breese, an
American girl. One thing is certain, no
one can assert that D'Eresby is marry

not cash that has ensnared him. He is
one of those fortunate aristocrats who

natural course of things it cannot be
long before Lord Willoughby succeeds
to the. title and the broad acres and
magnificent country seats that go with
it. There are three country seatsâ
Grlmsthorpe Castle in Lincolnshire,
Normanton Park near Stamford and
Drummond Castle in Perthshire, Scot
land.
The Earl of Ancaster is hereditary
Lord Great Chamberlain of England, an
honor which he shares with Lord Chol
moiideley, pronouncea Chumley. \u25a0 The
House of Lords was unable to. decide
which of the two houses had the best
claim to the billet and settled the mat
ter by an amicable arrangement under
which their respective heads alternate
,in the office.. The Earl held -it until
Queen Victoria's death and . then ..the
Marquis took his inning. After he .be
comes Earl of Ancaster Lord Willough
by will succeed to it; some -day. :Llke
most high-sounding jobs in this coun
try, its duties are easy and chiefly orna
mental, but it carries with it a lot of
privileges and brings the person hold-
Ing it into close contact with the sover
eign and other royalties, and, oftnee'es-.
slty, his wife, too.
There can be no question therefore
that the future 'American Countess 'of
THE SAN/ FRANGISGO; GALL;; SUNDAY, NOVE^IBER 26, 1905; .
Ancaster ; will have every; opportunity
for gratfying -the : most exalted social
ambitions she may, entertain. ; But to
do her: justice Miss Breese- hardly needs
such. assistance. She'has already made
good.her footing' inside.\thV royal circle.
She is a great friend of'the young Con
naught. Princesa.es \ arid.; was' one s of ;. th^e
few unmarried young^women who were
invited to be. present at'<thie;royal.wed
ding at Windsor in" June last/*
There are many, perquisites and gifts
attached; to the = Lord Great Chamber-
lain's office andVthose that: have- fallen
to. the Willoughbys are stored at Grlms
thorpe Castle, constituting a veritable
museum of royal', relics ; and other in^
teresting antiques'.; Among;. them are
the clothes worn: : by Charles I, ' King
James and George fIV at their corona
tions; a clock from the House of Lords
which stopped ticking at the; moment
of King George Ill's, death, and; /of
course, has --never'; been permitted 'to
record time's fiighit since; chairs
used by Kings and; Queens on state oc
casions;- rich i tapestries .and draperies
and lots of other Uhingslthat are':sup
poffed to "be prodigious, value 'because
of their association^ with, royalty.
Grlmsthorpe I* Castle : is; a;: grand ; ;oki
house, though- It ; is seldom used' by the
i present Earl for shooting
parties. Somelportlons of-it date from

eastern 'Â«side *, was ; built by."they Puke of
Suffolk and this contains the 'drawing
rooms in which Klngi Henry" Vlll and
Catherine Howard were 'entertained , in
1541. The castle to-day 'forms ?a. hoi-"

west sides having "beautiful -views

acres. 'Big- parks are" also ; attached to
Normanton-: and ' Drummond' Castle.;

Lord. Willoughby; is 38 years bld/jHe
used to. be known as a' dashlngiyoung
fellow and fond of a frolic. He'can
still singTa; good : comic ' song, : but- set

of Lincolnshire in ,otheV House 'of, Coin,

though he ha"s ( cut,nogreat;flguro there.
He is both good, natured and good look

he can -be : depended on -never to. make

Kuhio Kalanianole of Hawaii,' Republ
ican Delegate from Hawaii to" the fifty
ninth arrived \u25a0 to-day f rom ,
Honolulu by the steamship Aorangi,; en
route ! to Washington-
.Prince Kalanianole said the labor
question" now confronting Hawaii "Is
most' serious. The sugar, plantations
were the chief industries;, in fact, the
mainstay of the Islands..' Before an
nexation they depended , on Asiatic;
mostly Chinese, labor, and ; now- that
Chinese- were , not- admitted the scarcity
of labor has become a serious question.
Japanese were allowed to land, .but
were unstable and unsatisfactory.
Portuguese and Galicians ' had been
tried, but, they did not meet 'the re
quirements."
Prince; Kalanianole- said he favored
the admission of a certain number of
Chinese under contract-similar to the
British system in- the Transvaal, al
though he did not. know how the
United States" would favor such a
scheme. . Something had to be done, as
the planters were suffering from "lack
of 'labor. \u25a0 ' 'Â«\u25a0
.Hawaii also suffered \by the opera
tion of the United States shipping
laws, said ; the Prince. He did not
think there, was sufficient. American
shipping to fill requirements , and the
operation of the shipping laws worked
a hardship and caused a. loss. He
thought It unjust, but It" had to be
borne, as the islands were now part
of the United States.
: The Prince said his election had been
contested by the' defeated candidate,
lawakea, who claimed the. election was
illegal.. He said he would easily show
Its legality.

SAN FRANCISCAN
INVENTS PRESS
Evolves a Machine Which
'Promises to Eevolutionize
Printing All Over World
FEEDS AUTOMATICALLY
' To San Francisco has come the honor
of being the home of an Invention which
promises to revolutionize the art ot
modern printing. As superior to the
old . Ben ; Franklin hand printing press
as was the new steam machine which
printed thousands of sheets where for
merly hundreds had been run off, so
this new San Francisco invention, an
automatic press and an automatic
feeder, is a' great step in advance of
the machines now in use in every Job
printing house in the United States.
This invention promises to do for the
press room what the linotype machine,
the wonderful appliance which super
seded the old hand style of composition,
did for the composing room â increase
the capacity of the shop a hundred-fold.
The inventor of this wonderful ma
chine is Mr. J. . JV. Hoag of 28 First
street. There he has had his new press
on exhibition for several weeks and
each day his office has been crowded
with people who are anxious to
watch the marvelously quick work
of the new invention. Before their
astonished gaze it will take pa
per from the bottom of a pile,
carefully picking: up one sheet at
a time â it never makes a mistake â and.
print the sheets at the rate of over 3009 i
per hour. 1 This is Indeed a wonderful*
achievement, but it. is not all that thia.
machine does. It not only seizes thÂ«
paper, be it onion-skin or heaviest Bel
fast, and prints It rapidly, but at the
same time it delivers each sheet In per
fect shape into a receiving box fitted
for the purpose, where It can be easily
taken out and bound or folded.
Mr. Hoag claims for. his press that It
will force its way into every printing
office in the world. He says that it will
take the place of every hand feeding
press now in use. His invention Is. so
complete that one man is able to ope
rate four machines at once, thus doing
the work which it takes twelve men to
do to-day.. RHPBKGBI * *

Korea, with a military escort, including
â¢gendarmerie, came to the palace, but up
to midnight had not succeeded in per
suading the Emperor to sign. Thereupon
Secretary Stevens brought from the Min
istry of Foreign Affairs the official seal
of the Ministry, which was obtained by
force, and at 10:30 o'clock In the morn-
Ing the Japanese themselves placed the
geal on the treaty, the Emperor to the
en>i refusing to give his signature."
/ The dispatch concludes:
jf^ "The entire palace, even the private
apartments of the Emperor, are now oc
cupied by Japanese gendarmerie, and it
is probable that the Japanese will soon
compel the Emperor to sign."

NAVAL EXPERTS,
FAIL TO AGREE
WASHINGTON, Nov. 25.â Whether, the
President shall be requested *,to â¢ recom
mend to Congress the authorization of
battleships displacing, 18,000 Instead .of
16.000^ tons, rests with Secretary Bona
parte, who has before him the conflict
ing reports of the- general board of â¢ the
navy and the Board of Construction. The
former, of which Admjral Dewey is
president, consists of the -" chief of the
Bureau of Navigation, the president of
the Naval College,, the chief intelligence
officer and four other line officers. -The
The. Board ; of . Construction is composed
of the chiefs of the bureaus of, steam en-;
glneering, equipment,' ordnance ; and con
struction and repair, and in l the event
of a tie vote the chief of the Bureau ot
Navigation. â¢
Great Britain having ordered the .build
ing of a battleship displacing on .^trial
18,000 tons, .' the Dreadnaught, as an ex
periment, the : general board Is in favor
of the American â¢ navy following ; suit by
building .three new,' battleships -of i 18,000
tons, and . by " Increasing the ' tonnage of
the two battleships authorized at- the
last Congress, the \u25a0 South Carolina, " and
Michigan, from 16,000 : ; to 18,000 : tons. In
addition, the general board asks for three
scout cruisers, gunboats . and additional
torpedo-boats and destroyers. .
The Board of Construction in its \u25a0 re
port to " the ; Secretarj' disapproves : of : the
first Item ,of the general ; board's pro^
gramme, the authorization \u25a0 tori IS,OOO-ton

FIND INFANT'S
BODY IN PARK
The body of an unknown baby boy,
whose life was snuffed out just after
birth, was found by two boys in the
vicinity of Glen Park yesterday! , 1 The
detectives who have been detailed on
the .case are of the opinion that murder
was committed.' and an effort will be
made to, trace the heartless parents.
.The crime was ; committed by, severing
the [ umbilical cord before it had been
ligated. ,
Two boys. Henry Pulsing of 521
Twenty-eighth street; and Henry Boyce.
who resides at the corner of Twenty
eighth - and Diamond streets, were
roaming over the hills in .the r vicinity
of Glen, Park when they came upon a
bundle wrapped In newspapers. Curiosity
prompted them to aacertaln what Its con
tents were and when they opened the
package they were horrified to find the
body of the , child. Both are of tender
years and they hastily dropped the papers
and their contents and rushed to their
homes. After the parents of the boys had
been informed a message was sent to the
Seventeenth-street police station and Pat
trolman T. J. Connell was sent to investi
gate.
The patrolman found the boys and re-
Quested them to lead him to the place
whsre the body was. Both had some dif
ficulty in retracing thÂ«ir steps, but after
a persistent search. the dead Infant was
located in a clump of bushes* at thÂ« cor
ner, of Diamond and Essex streets. It
weighed twelve pounds, and. according te?
the Coroner's deputies, who were called
to the scene, did not die until after birth
â¢ â¢ The people In ' the neighborhood were
unable to give Detectives Bunncr and
Freel, who were detailed on the case, any
clew that would assist them In discovering
the identity of the parents:. The baby had
blue eyes and golden hair and It is pos
sible that It will pass to a grave in the
Potter's field. and that its history will
never be known.ADVERTISEMENTS.

OFFERS GOVERNMENT
PROPERTY FOR SALE
Denver Tax Collector Says He
_Will Give Title to
:': ' Purchaser.
DENVER,' No. 25. â Denver property
owners were 'startled to-day when they
learned that a tax title to half of the
Ernest & Cranmer block, worth three
-quarters of a million, had been sold for
$5000 and that the Denver postoffice,
Denver University, the mint and other
property could be had for a song. As
the property is described by lot and
block only, no one realized what was
happening until the sale caused an In
vestigation. Regular taxes on all the
property have been paid, but when the
Fourteen-street viaduct was built a
special tax was levied against all the
property within an Improvement dis
trict which was created.
Many property-owners knew noth'lng
of this tax and tax titles to their prop
erty have been sold without their
knowledge. .Public property is exempt
from ordinary taxation, but the Asses
sor claims it is not exempt from the
special Improvement tax. The attempt
to sell a tax title to Uncle Sam's post
offloe and his mint property is con
sidered humorous. Speculators In tax
titles have not had the temerity to give
$196 48 for tbe postofflce, which cost
1400,000, though the Tax Collector is
willing to take that sum.

ALMOST WORTHLESS
International Fleet Leaves

Boats Remaining Behind
PARIS, Nov. 26.â (8 p. . m.)âlnforma
tion reaching official quarters leads to"
confidence that Turkey's resistance to
the powers will not go to the extent of
military or naval measures of defense.
An official who passed the Dardanelles
during the last few days said to-day that
Turkey's few available warships at the
Golden Horn were worthless hulks. | More
over, the official view is : that - the ' Sultan
will not permit the firing of a shot which
might precipitate war. Turkish land op
erations, said the official, are eaually un
likely.
The Island of Mytllene has a garrison
of several hundred troops, but the French
officials say these were withdrawn to a
remote part .of the island when the
French landing occurred In 1901, owing
to the Sultan's desire to avoid the possi
bility of an armed conflict. The present
seizure of the Mytllene customs Is ex
pected to be executed with a similar ab
sence of armed resistance.
The Temps this afternoon printed a
dispatch from Constantinople saying that
the palace officials were deeply agitated
by the firmness of the powers, leading to
indications that the negative response of
the Porte would be reconsidered.
It was learned at the Foreign Office
that Austria and Russia, in behalf of the
powers, have addressed a strong note to
Bulgaria, Servia and- Greece, warning
them that the. powers' naval demonstra
tion against Turkey should not be made
a pretext for revolutionary movements
on the part of these countries against
Turkey. .-., .; â¢ \u25a0â¢, â¢
ATHENS. - Nov. 25.â The International
fleet assembled at Piraeus for the pur
pose of making a naval demonstration
against Turkey In support of the demands
of the powers for financial control of Ma
cedonia, sailed at noon to-day under
sealed orders. British and French torpe
do-boats were ; left behind j to keep up
communicatoin with the fleet. ;
. CONSTANTINOPLE, Nov. 25.â The
Embassadors of the powers, at a confer
ence Just held, decided to proceed with
the naval- demonstration as â¢ the .best re
ply _to the , Porte's, : note.
g There is.', absolutely, no sign, among the
Mussulmans â¢of Constantinople that they
are in the least way disturbed concerning
the ' question lof the > financial i control -.Tot
Macedonia. The vast majority are not
aware that such a question exists. The
aspect of the city Is perfectly normal and
there appears to be no chance of an anti-
Christian movement, unless the word be
given from high quarters.
It is persistently reported, but not yet
confirmed, that the Grand Vizier, Ferrid
Pasha, has been dismissed and replaced
by Abidln Pasha. Governor General of the
Archipelago. As the acceptance of the
demands .of the powers . requires scape
goats, there Is a disposition In some quar
ters to credit the report as being the pre
cursor of the abandonment by the Porte
of- of Its present attitude.
Following the precedent which he set
when the Russian fleet made a demon
stration off the coast of Inlada in 1903,
the Sultan has charged Vice Admiral Hus
nl Pasha, who left Constantinople on No
vember 23 on a special steamship for the
Dardanelles, to welcome the international
fleet with presents of fruit, candies and
cigarettes. -.-. . ,; y ."\u25a0\u25a0.,.<. ./'

BEAT AND ROB
SAN JOSE MAN
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
SAN JOSE. Nov. 25.â J. H. Blunt, , a
driver for Benson's meat market, was
to-day waylaid by two highwaymen on"
the Alameda road near this city and
robbed of $50 which he had collected dur :
Ing the day. Blunt was driving his meat
wagon back to town after a trip to New
Almaden. When about a half mile from
Anderson's Corners two men sprang In
front of the horses and brought them to
a standstill, at the same time covering
Blunt with their revolvers. The robbers
demanded his money. Blunt refused to
surrender the cash and the men ap
proached from ( opposite sides and at
tempted . to ' overpower him. Blunt was
game \ and fought desperately, but was
finally stunned by n repeated blows over
the bead and dragged from the seat of
the wagon. -As j soon as he loosened the
lines the horses j took fright and ran Into
town to the market
The arrival of the wagon minus a
driver was- the first indication of the
holdup, and a search for Blunt was
started. He was . found , at Andersons
Corners, where he had dragged himself
after he had been beaten nearly Insensi
ble and robbed of all his money. He was
brought toÂ° the Red Cross Sanitarium and
stitches were taken in fifteen cuts about
his face and head.
Sheriff Ross with a r number of depu
ties left for the scene of the holdup with
a good description of the ' two robbers,
and the neighborhood Is being searched.
Blunt states that he ' kicked ' one ' of the
robbers In the face as ]he was climbing
upon the wagon - and knocked him to the
ground.

Wing will not be relieved \u25a0 unless orders
are received from' Washington. He will
continue , in the office j working under my
direction "for! the present. Every branch
of the office will be gone Into thoroughly.
Adams will bÂ« prosecuted for stealing
Government property. The dust which he
took '\u25a0 had passed to . the control . of the
Government : and was Its property."
This afternoon the Government levied
upon $25,000 worth of' real estate owned
by Adams and attached $12,000 he had on
deposit In local banks. This, with the
$12,000 found on his person, represents
what has so far been secured from the
wreck. \u25a0 Other attachments on . his busi

Iron Works of South Beilingham. He
found It Is true. It has also been estab
lished that Adams owned a majority In
terest in the real estate firm of Guion &

business concerns.
To-day for the first time Mrs. -Adams
was told of her husband's plight Rev.
Mr. Lloyd, her pastor, broke the news in
the bed chamber, amid the cries of | her
infant baby. She bore up bravely, but the
scene was a sad one. It* is stated \ that
Mrs. Cleary,^ mother of Mrs. Adams. Is
on ; the verge of - losing- hec mind. - The
cowardly charge of Adams that it was
to' support her he stole struck home. It
is stated that at the present â¢ moment
there is not' a cent of money In the
Adams household, but there is no want,
for friends are , attending to the needs
of both Mrs. Adams and Mrs. . Cleary." :-\u25a0

SANTA CRUZ. Nov. <25.-^Judge CraÂ«
hlll had the time of his life this morn
lngr. - He married" three -Italian oouples.
and, by the time the last knot was tied
the Judge was â¢ about ready to resign
from the bench. The first knot wu
tied in remarkably quick time, and the
second couple .was : summoned. With
their appearance came trouble. The
Judge discovered that he had married
the first pair under the namesof the
second aspirants, for matrimonial hon
ors. The mlHtake was remedied and
once moro was the second couple. called.
Then It was discovered that the groom
â¢had forgotten his marriage license and
ho was B*Â»nt post haste after the much
needed, document. \u25a0
By tho time he got back couple No.
8 had been safely united and the
brides and grooms were sitting In the
corners . holding each - others' hands.
Couple No. 2 once more took a place be
fore the "Judge, the .groom, as he
stepped forward taking a j long,' . legal
looking document from his pocket. One
glance the Judge took and then he said
something under his breath (quoted
from the Civil Code the clerk of the
court announced).' Perhaps he did, but
the next thing he said is not contained
In any law book. , It was a command to
the groom ; to take back bis naturaliza
tion papers and get his marriage li
cense. In due time the necessary pa
pers arrived and the Judge tied the
third knot. ,
But his troubles were far from being
over, for one groom arose and read
from the code book for the edification
of his bride the sections pertaining to
marriage, and; then Insisted that the
marriage ceremony should be gone
through with again, with the aid of an
Interpreter. The Judge ; granted his re
quest and â¢'\u25a0: wearily nodded an af
firmative when the other two grojjms
requested a similar favor.
The blushing! brides are - three young
girls from Italy, who came; to Santa
Cruz ; last week from Italy to Join their
fortunes to three well-known Italian
residents of the Beach City. Their
names were Adelaide Boggero, Ade-'
lalde Coclto and Angelina Valle. Now
they are respectively Mrs. Orlando

The bride is a California girl, daughter
of the late John Ellis. She has spent the
greater -part of her life In this city. She
first met tho groom when he was travel-
Ing through this State some five years
ago.
The groom has Just been appointed by
President Roosevelt as United States Con
sul at Chungking and is now on his
way to that Dost. / '
Consul Mitchell was one of Roosevelt's
Rough Riders and was with that troop
during all its campaign in Cuba. Three
years ago Mitchell was appointed a Con
sul at Zanzibar. While there he scent
much of his time when off duty in hunt-
Ing big game. He made several trips into
the mountain fastnesses after elephants.
He succeeded In killing four. The largest
one weighed about six tons. It was a
fierce brute \u25a0 and showed fight Â» when it
found it was being attacked." It charged
with tremendous fury upon the native
attendants, who were only armed with
spears. The natives fled Into the jungle"
and took refuge behind t>lg tropical tree 3.
Mitchell, after several shots, hit the brute
In the ear, the bullet passing through the
big head ; and lodging in the elephant's
brain. "-
The huge animal ran about- fifty yards
and fell. The natives Immediately
swarmed about the fallen monster and
hurled their spears into its thick hide.
The tusks of the animal weighed 132
pounds. \u25a0
Mitchell says the climate in Zanzibar
is warm, humid and enervating. He was
four times laid up with fever. It Is usual
for a United States Consul to remain. In
that country only two years, but Mitchell
Staid; three. ) Soon after \u25a0 his return to
America President Roosevelt appointed
him Consul to Chungking. He will

STATE ARMORY
AT SACRAMENTO
Dedicated in tlie Presence
Many "Prominent Mem
bers of the National Guard
DftILL BADLY ATTENDED
Inspection of Different Or
ganizations to Commence
in January Next Year
The event of the last week . in the Na
tional Guard of _ the State . was the dedi
cation, in Sacramento, <of the new ar
mory at Sixth and M streets to the use
of the organizations' located in that city.
There were present on that. occasion th?
commander in chief, Governor Pardee;
the members of his staff, Brigadier. Gen
eral Lauck, adjutant general of the State;
Brigadier General Koster of the Second
Brigade and staff; Colonel Filmer of the
First Infantry and members of his; staff;
Colonel H. L Seymour, commanding tho
Second Infantry, his staff and band,- and
Companies B, F, G, H and I of his com
mand; a detachment of- the Hospital
Corps of that regiment; Troop b; n First
Squadron of Cavalry; Major Kessling,
commanding the battalion of . the First
Coast Artillery; Major D. A. Smith of
the Fifth Infantry, and Captain Vander
bllt of Company D of that 'regiment, and
Major S., W.. Kay, commanding the First
Squadron of Cavalry, and his staff.
There were also in attendance many com
missioned officers, thirty-nine having left
this city to attend the ceremonies. The
new armory is up to data and admirably
adapted to the organizations that are to
occupy it. After the ceremony of dedi
cation and speeches appropriate to the
occasion, there was served a collation,
and then there was a programme of
dancing.
IMPROYB3IEXTS NOTED.
Last week Company F of the Fifth In
fantry, Captain Wetheren, located in
Oakland, gave an entertainment in its
new armory, and among the prominent
officers present were Brigadier General
Koster, members of .bis staff, and Major
Smith of the Fifth Infantry. The briga
dier general says that- this company,
which was not very strong . In : 1904, has
picked up lately and that at this time
the personnel is a credit *to the . guard.
While on that , occasion there were no
military movements he noticed that thÂ«
officers and members .are up ; to; disci
pline, being correct at all times in the
niatter of recognition of euperior : offi
cers. â¢ .-
During the last week Major Kelly's
tattallon of the First Infantry had a bat
tallon drill In the armory at , Page and
Gough streets. The " companies, with
the exception of Company D, made a
creditable showing: on the floor. That
company was .very "shy" as to numbers
and an Inquiry will be set afoot to as
certain why the men of that organization
did not show up. â¢'?.
. Company G of the . First Infantry has
elected First Sergeant Henry Tuggey first
lieutenant.
TO DEDICATE ARMORY.
On the night of November 29 the new
armory of Company A, Fifth Infantvy,
located in Oakland; will: be dedi
cated with r appropriate military cere
monies, after which there is to be a balL
This is, tbÂ« company, of .which Governor
Pardee was captain. The: Governor,-- Ad-:
Jutant General Lauck, . Brigadier | GeneraJ
Koster and a number, of mother: officers
have been invited to jbe in attendance.
The annual inspection of the guard will
bo early in 1906. This will commence in
January in the First Brigade \u25a0 and will
be continued uninterruptedly until all the
organizations shall have been Inspected.
As yet the officer who is to inspect them
for the War Department has not been
named, but it is believed that Major
Wilhelm, ,-U.v 8. A., who Inspected the
guard last year, will agaln.be designated
for that duty. Tie one - who is to in
spect, on behalf of the State .will; shortly
be announced.
After the December vacations, the or
ganizations In the Second Brigade will
have an inspector who will make a num
ber of visits to ' each during the year for
the purpose of ascertaining the condition
of each at such time when the inspecting
officer is not expected. The rating {of
each company will! be based â¢ on the re
port of the* inspector". ' : .\ .This will be an
innovation. Instead of giving each com
pany its rating according to the annual
inspection, as in the past.
George B.Pillsbury, for a long time
chief engineer of the Pacific . Electric
Hallway", has been appointed on . the start
of the commander in chief, with the
rank of lieutenant, colonel.

Mendicant. Excites Compassion byi

Pup Becomes Too-Well Fed to Work^
and Turns: on. His Master. i
One of _ the most ingenious .begging
tricks that has ever been worked on
a sympathetic public was unmasked In
Judge Fritz's court. . John Flemmlng,
who has been operating it, was be
trayed by his pai'tner, a; bulldog, and
will probably never be able to.run tho
same game again. \u0084'.
Flemming and. the dog that betrayed
him had their stand 'near Third and
Mission streets. Whenever a benevo
lent-looking party approached Flem
mlng would drop a bone. -The canine
member of the corporation would seize
the morsel. , â¢ :\u25a0
. Flemmins would tear it away from
him after a lively tussle. This natur
ally would attract the attention of the
benevolent passers-by.
"Shame," the crowd said. "Let the
poor dog have 'his bone."
Flemmlng looked dejected. "Very
well,", he said, "I'll let him have it.; It
wouldn't- keep me alive much longer
anyhow.' Me teeth are bad and me
stomach couldn't digest It: anyhow."
â¢ Of course, somebody would pass. the
hat. Flemmlng and his dog waxed
fat. And it was not . long till they
were enjoying too much prosperity. >
Just as they were about to quit work
on Friday Flemming saw; a promising
looking crowd approaching. 'He
dropped the bone. Sport merely sniffed
at 'it.' ' '": \u25a0 :'.'\u25a0'\u25a0 -\ -- \u25a0 ;â¢:\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 ?. \u25a0'
"Get busy. Sport," pleaded ;"' Flem
ming, but the dog refused to, do ' ; his
st^nt. Flemmlng kicked him :in the
ribs. The dog flew at ;\u25a0 him ' and cut a
gash under one eye.: Then; he fastened
his teeth into â¢Flemming'e trousers.
. By the time Policeman P. iNolan ar
rived the; dog ' had Hhe decision . and
Flemmlng was more [ than? anxious to
throw up the sponge.*' Before. Judge

the canine and the; case .was continued

\u25a0 When Mary Anderson i was banished
to, the County Jail a week J ago- ; she
turned over ;the keys to- her. villa, on
the Rue . de Brannan to her , friend,
Maude Coakiey. -\u25a0\u25a0. â¢ "> . '
"Make "yourself .: at â¢ home, Maudie,".
said Mary. "Just simply go as far as
you like." - - \u25a0 - -\u25a0 -
And Maude did go some. The : first :
thing sho did was to have Mary's
growler, mended. . Mary had playfully
turned it: Inside out over the. head of
the policeman who had arrested her.'
Then Maude .started v to] enter taia.
Never was -there such hospitality -dis
played aloiig the Rue de Brannan. Tho
Anderson chateau during the . brief stay
of Misa \ Coakiey was the scene ;of
many, a brilliant social functlon-^-too
many' for -the neighborhood. ; "An open
door and a full growler," was; Maude's
family motto, and , she lived up to It.
' Complaints: were carried to the
Southern station and Policeman Au
gust Grler *was detailed to investigate.
From the sounds that proceeded from
the chateau Grler decided ; . that Maude
was drunk, but-. a, technicality, \u25a0 inter
fered with her- arrest. \ She was , not
drunk In a* public place., .
If. she would only come into the gar
den like Tennyson's Maude, she would be
technically "/ as well : as \u25a0 literally drunk.
But Maude was coy. â¢
Grier knew that the . growler would
sooner, or later be emptied. and threw, up
entrenchments near the " gate of the cha
teau. The unsuspecting^ Maude soon came
1 tripping out to replenish the can and sus
tain .her -reputation for hospitality.
"Come 1 with me," he said. i
Maude drew herself up haughtily. "The
arrest is: not legal," she said. â¢ :
. "But ; I am a , policeman,'.' ; insisted Gier.
He tried to drag her., to a patrol - box, but
she : put; up -a ; desperate resistance. ;,

500 men's winter overcoats and craven
ettes, for $9 85. These suits and over
coats have just arrived, and, by the
way, clothing arrives every day, and
must be sold to make room for more.
"Buy quick and. sell quick" is Herman's
motto. Why pay $20 â yes, some houses
ask even more for clothing not as good
â when you can buy them for the little
sum of $9 86? 1057 Market street is not
out of town â right opposite Jones,
within reach of everybody. 6c carfare
will bring you there. A saving of over
$10 on either suit or overcoat is worth
the trouble. *

Probably no man in the United SUtea

more extensively than General Chaff ee.
He has been practically in every coun

decision to make the West his home is
a tribute to California and to the cities

He, however, chooses to retire now,
having been in the service more than

about 6 o'clock last evening, and when
about half way between the south gate
and the hospital a man stepped. from the

is a well built athlete, was gradually, get
ting the best of his antagonist,. when. the
pistol was discharged, the 'bullet "passing
through the soldier's right hand near the
Joint of the thumb and Index | finger. -
The guard was attracted to the soene

made his escape, and although, a thor

could be found. Mannee was taken to
the general hospital, where his hand
was dressed. : ,
The robber was described as a very
large man who wore a soldier's coat with
a black hat and trousers. Mannee says

FAIR JULIET
AS SOUBRETTE
Shakespeare's Play Will Be
Turned Into a Musical
Comedy *at London Theater
NEW WOEK BY PHILLIPS
Drama "Centering About the
i Emperor Neix) to Be Staged
I Early in the Coming Year
Spcclti DispatcH to Tht CaU.
LONDON,. Nov. 25. â Outside the Lon
don "Vau4Â«vllle," where "Tho Catch of
the Season" is being- played, posters an
nounce, that, the 600 th performance is
oloee at hand. Nevertheless this phe
nomenally successful musical comedy
Is expected to run on in London until
the beginning of February at least, and
meanwhile, with Edna May as Its
heroine, the piece seems to be enjoying
quite as much favor, in the United
States. It Is, of course, just the old
story of Cinderella provided with a
modern setting by Cosmo Hamilton and
Seymour Hicks, and its success has
convinced those interested that other
as familiar themes can be made tha
groundwork for musical comedies. -
That Edna May is to make her re
appearance at the "Vaudeville" in an
up-to-date musical version of "Romeo
and Juliet" has been announced, and
it may be added that Captain Robert
Marshall, whose idea it originally was
to make "Cinderella" into a musical
play, is thinking seriously of commit
ting the same, indignity upon "Don
Quixote," while Seymour Hicks and
Cosmo Hamilton have their eyea on the
musical comedy -possibilities of "David
Garrlck/v <. .
Ths Vaudeville version of "Romeo and
Juliet" is be)ng made by two experienced
librettists, Captain Basil Hood and Charie a
Brookneld. Of course the play which they
are writing for Edna. May Is intended to
bear only the slightest resemblance to
the story of- Shakespeare's lovers. For
instance, in this musical comedy the an
tagonism between the Montagues and the
Capulets becomes a feud between aristo
cratic poverty on the one hand and low
bred plutocracy on the other. But the
most promising thing about the new piece
is that the score will be furnished by Les
lie Stuaisl, who composed "Florodora,"
and - who set people humming again on
both sides of the Atlantic, with "The
School Girl." The Gattis and Charles
Frohman, who control the Vaudeville, will
produce the new piece, which is .expected
to be ready for Miss May's use on her re
turn from her American tour next
spring.
DOYLE XO PLAYWRIGHT.
It la rather interesting to learn that
for all of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's repu
tation he is one of the many folks who
want to get plays produced, and can't.
It seems that. Inspired by the success of
"Sherlock Holmes" on the stage. Dr.
Doyle conceived the Idea of making ~a
play out of his "Adventures of Brigadier
Gerard," and did so. Managers, however,
failed to be attracted by it.
"I offered it to a good many," confided
Dr.* Doyle to. an interviewer this week,
"only to have it refused, but I am still
confident that it would make a good play,
although the managers are equally cer
tain that It would not. I hoped at one
time that Martin Harvey would accept It
and appear as Gerard, but this: proved
impracticable."
In the same Interview Dr. Doyle de
clared that the work of preparing his
"Sherlock Holmes" for the stage was
entirely that of 'William Gillette.
"He took my story," said Sir Arthur,
"and used it to obtain the best effect
I think ho has a wonderful genius for
situations."
In epite of the fact that there Is a new
play by Pinero coming on, the theatrical
sensation of this season seems likely to
be the production of Stephen Phillips'
"Nero," which Tree Is going to put on
in January. . One may count on tremen
dous stage effects at His Majesty's
whenever there Is the slightest excuse
for them, and there will be an uncom
monly good excuse In a play about
"Nero," but there is also likely to be
some uncommonly good poetry in Phil
lips' new poetic drama, as well as some
striking situations. f
There have been few finer works in the
last decade than the same author's "Pa
olo and Francesca," given by George
Alexander; there were striking lines in
both his "Herod" and "Ulysses," and
there Is reason to expect - even better
things in "Nero." That is because the
character of the pagan Emperor has at
tracted this playwright ever since his
boyhood; In fact. Stephen Phillips told
an acquaintance the other day that the
opening lines of his three-act drama were
wjltten when he was only 15.^
PHILLIPS' IDEA OF JVERO.
Phillips Is convinced that Nero was no
monster, btft, above all things, a dreamer
and a poet, and In support of this view
he points out that as soon as he assumed
the purple he summoned to the Imperial
court the singer, Terpnus, and henceforth
devoted himself to music, painting, sculp
ture and the composition of verse.
"The passion for art," said Phillips,
"colored every thought and action of his
life. Even when he committed a murder
he considered the artistic possibilities the
tragedy would afford. And when to him
death was but a question of- seconds and
he tieard the noise of horsemen sent to
kill him galloping along the road, he fell
to quoting Homer and died exclaiming:
'What. an artist is lost in me!' , Such was
the Nero I have endeavored to resuscitate
In my "play."'
Phillips shows us Nero as target ..or
the passions of three womenâ the tigerish
maternal love of Agrippina, the Inter
ested attachment of Poppea, the beautiful
courtesan, and the tender devouon of the
slave, Acte, who remained faithful to the
Emperor even after his death. The action
of his play takes place partly at Rome
and partly at lialae. the famous Roman
pleasure- resort, which should give a
chance for some effective stage pictures.
The last tableau will show the burning
of tha Eternal City, but Instead of Nero'a
viewing the conflagration from a tower
and singing the elegy of, Slmonides, the
Emperor is seen trembling with fear and
awe-struck at the sight. \
Tree will, of course, be Nero, while the
part of Poppea will be played by Con
stance Collier, who . is ,now appearing -at
hii Majesty's as Nancy in "Oliver Twist."
If the new Stephen Phillips play is a
success It goes without saying that it will
be given In the United States.'--'

Secretary King of the Merchants'
Association reports that the. rush for
seats at the eigrhth annual dinner of the
association, to be held December 5, Is
phenomenal. There has 'always been a
great demand for seats on such occa
sions. The number, of applications-re
ceived this year during Une first, two
days after the invitations were sent out
exceeds anything heretofore: One
half of the entire- seating capacity of
the ladles', grillrom of the Palace Hotel
was sold during the first day. Satur
day evening there , was only 100 seats
left in the entire halL . , â¢
It is already apparent to the officers
of the association that there ; Is Uttle
likelihood of there being, any/opportu
nity for members to bring guests this
year, as the members have :. the first
choice for seats up Â«to 5 pS m. Friday,
December 1, and by that time, from the
present appearance of things,! It Is al
most certain that every seat will have
been sold. The great demand by, mem
bers for seats is .very gratifying and

HEBREW ADVENT

Local Jewish Citizens Cele
brate Anniversary of
Landing of yForef atners
ADVANCE IN POWER
Rabbi M.S. Levy in Eloquent
Sermon Tells How | Race
Has Reached Front Here
Throughout San Francisco yesterday
the Jewish* population : celebrated . in
their synagroffues with i due ceremony
the two hundred and fiftieth anniver
sary of the landing of the first pllsrrims
of the Jewish faith on the shores of the
northern half of the, "Western contlnenL
This band of twenty-one obtained their
charter from the Dutch West India
Company in Holland and came to : New
York, then New Netherlands, from
Brazil in 1665. For- a time Governor
Peter Stuyvesant oposed their landing,
but persistence triumphed and their de
scendants are to-day counted among
the loyal sons of the nation.
Even after overcoming the opposition
of the 'Dutch Governor the little band
had difficulty ln^ obtaining a charter, to
do business, but one was finally granted
and the Jew gained a firm foothold and
grew with [ the nation. His sons have
their names, enrolled on the pages of
the nation's Book of Patriots, \u25a0 for ; the
loyalty of 'the Jew was manifest long
before : Revolutionary times. . ; -,
When the; War of the Revolution
broke out upon the land none served
the . colonies better in lending- B money
and' lifeblood to the cause of liberty
than did the Jews, then grown a strong
multiplication of the little band that
first' Bet. foot on the land 121 years before.
From revolutionary times the Jewish
record of citizen and patriot is proudly
pointed to and no record Is freer from
blot or stain. ;. , ' . . .

he surrendered himself into the cus

released on $3000 bonds, his sureties
being James McNab and C. W. Gould.
He was accompanied by his attorney,
William Denman. Just as the formality
of his. surrender and release was re
corded he learned that not only In the
criminal but In the civil courts as
well must he defend himself against
the woman that would send him to
prison and drive from his side the
wife he took in 18S9.
The alleged Mrs. Amy's move in the
civil court was In the nature of an
action for maintenance, in which she is
represented by Attorney S. J. Hankins.

she wedded Amy at Graf ton, X. H., and
lived IHlh him for ten years, when he
abandoned her. During the almost
quarter of a century that has elapsed
Eince Amy abandoned her, as she al
leges, he has not contributed $1 toward
k^er support. Now, she asserts, he is
worth 5100,000 and she asks that he be
compelled to maintain her and that he
pay the costs and counsel fees in
curred by her In her action to estab
lish her rights.
After being Informed of the progress
of the various moves against him,
Amy said: ; â¢

OIL BARON'S
SEARCH FOR
FATHER ENDS
Winfield Scott MacKillup,
a Millionaire, Finds His
Parent in This City ;in
Poverty and Degradation
LOCATES RELATIVE
/ LONG LOST TO HIM
"Mac," a Eroken Down Em
ploye of a Boat Builder,
Encounters a Change /of
Fortune After Hard Life
After a search of nearly twenty-five
years, Winrteld Scott MacKillup /Jr., a
millionaire oil magnate of Houston, Tex.,
found his aged father, : Winfield Scott
MacKillup . Sr., in this city in poverty
and degradation. Father and son are
now speeding to Philadelphia; where. the
old man will meet his daughter,. whom he
has not seen since she was a baby. It
is the story of the prodigal son reversed.
For years, off and on, the elder Mac-
Killup has been in the employ of George
Kneass, the boat builder on Third street.
The old fellow was a slave to drink and
lived" in. a wretched fashion. " He , was
known in all the cheap saloons along
Third street as '.'Old Mac." -\u25a0 * "v." v . , v
Early this week "Mac"' disappeared.
"He is oft" on a spree," people said. But
on Wednesday Mac. reappeared at his old
haunts completely transformed. He was
clad as became the -lather of an oil mag
nate and he announced that he would
never drink again." He had just come to
say quod-by. He ,was going away with
his boy. . '
Young: MacKillup heard about a week
ago that his father was. ln this; city in
poverty. He abandoned' his bu3iness and
came here to find him. The "father and
son met .Monday," after , nearly twenty
live "years" separation.
Young MacKillup took the grimy old
man ,in his; arms, despite his: protests.
The father. broke down, lie had become
inured to kicks . and harsh ! treatment.
Tenderness was too much for 'him. .But
all of old "Mac's"' troubles are over nowl
lie is: 1 Mr. i Winficld â¢ Scott s. \u25a0MacKillup;
father* of a^'lon that; any 'father/ would
be f proud of.
For ' years .MacKillup" has been; ayfa
miliar object at the corner of.Brarinan

STARTLING REVELATIONS ARE MADE
TO PRISON DIRECTORS AT SAN QUENTIN
When the/State'Board of . Prison /Directors met at San Quentin yesterday to investigate
the case of Dentist Charles "Devlinit was startled to discover from evidence that trusties
were stealing and trafficking in prison supplies. Then came serious charges that Warden
Tompkins is inefficient. An investigation will follow. Devlin was exonerated.
STILL BELIVES
WOMAN A WITCH
Passing of a Day Does Not
Change the Mental Atti
tude of Murderer De Paoli
Fanatical belief in the spirit of the
"evil eye," the ! powerful .influence : that
impelled him to commit murder In. the
darkness of Friday morning, still lurks
in: the mind, of Louis de Paoli. He occu
pies a* cell at the City Jair and there
he j cries aloud at times over the death
of* his sister-in-law, a woman whom he
dearly, . loved. : Yet .' even now, - when ,the
awfulness of his deed has had- full .time
to weigh upon his mind, De Paoli . be
lieves in^his soul that he did. just .what
was right when he crushed the skull of
Catherine de Paoli with the heavy kitch
en chair. |
"eÃtter one die than five," he repeats
when questioned, -.Vsoi I 'killed her to save
my family. It would not be right for me
to let 1 my family die.r would it?" :
In the' fanatic belief in demon spirits
he is the same- Louis de Paoli now that
lie was | the : night s that jhe committed his
crime. ; He has not" one feeling of regret
.The case promises to be a puzzling one
forthe jury which will try him for mur
der .What 'can- be done with such a
man. Yesterday he was taken -1 before
Police Judge Mogan for arraignment. -A
large number of spectators crowded the
court to. see him. Â» If they expected to see
a villainous looking individual or a : crim
inally; ignorant wretch .they were disap
pointed, for; De Paoli walked In as quiet
ly as" though .he -was about to pick the
flowers in 'his little market garden. \ He
sat- still while rthe complaint was. read
to him, first in English and then in Ital
ian. He spoke shortly, at- times to
torney \u25a0; Spinetti,* who sat by - * his ! side.
Once. he. raided his hands in -the air and
pressed 'them \u0084-to â¢' his ' chest, 'exclaiming,
'\u0084'1 -am sick." . " .
i : The . hungry crowd pressed forward
eagerly," thinking that' something exciting
was about ! to .- occur. â¢ They were again

WARDEN J. "W. TOMPKINS. WHOSE MANAGEiTENT OF SAN QUENTtM PRI3- |
ON IS BEING INVESTIGATED BY THE PRISON COMMISSIONERS. Â« AND
VISITING DENTIST WHO WAS GIVEN CLEAN BILL OF HEALTH. J.
Trafficking in goods stolen frorit_,the
stores : of San . Quentin penitentiary and
serious 3 charges against Warden â¢J. W.
Tompldn's j management of I the institu
tion were: 'the startling developments
which came unexpectedly before the State
Board of Prison Directors yesterday aft
ernoon during its investigation of the of
ficial: conduct of; Dr. Charles A. Devlin,
the visiting dentist of the prison. Dr.
Devlin had been indirectly charged with
using his office as a means of supplying
the . prisoners with tobacco, ; and J the In
vestigation yesterday was primarily to
find out the Ttruth'of these charges. He
was completely vindicated, - but the in
quiry took- a; sudden turn/ however, and
the investigation will be continued until
every department* of the prison has been
given a ; thorough overhauling.' A lack
of executive ability on the part of the
Warden and a system of espionage main
tained t by] him were other startling dis
closures \u25a0;_ of the day's work. \ \
- The ' board . found that Dr. Devlin's offi
cial "actions had ever been honorable and
that he had never knowingly violated any
of the, rules of the penitentiary. , It found
that': he had t never been connected with
any i illicit trafficking in- tobacco or other
stores", with prisoners. ,
\u25a0*â¢ But, "as it turned ; out, the " hearing of
Dr. ': Devlin ;was ! only a' minor v part of. the
day's r t work, vj Immediately,' after the "\ first
orderjof business ;was : completed = the'dl

was their complaint that Warden Tomp
kins had established a system of espion
age over his guards. This spying system
Is ! based on the work of the convicts,
who, fearing punishment from the
Warden, the officers say, watch tha
guards and report every Infringement of
\u25a0 the rules. It is the fact that they are
watched by criminals whom they aro
â¢ paid -to guard, say these officers, and
such a system embitters them most to

Another alleged condition of affairs
will be locked into by the board. Nu
merous prisoners have made complaint
that they are cruelly treated for minor
breakings of the rules. They claim that
while "they are put In the straitjackct
for only six hours at a time, as the law
allows. Warden Tompkins. at the
end of the six hours* takes them
out for a ' second or two and then
place3.them In the *- jacket . again. OnÂ©
prisoner ; complained that : he had been
under such punishment a. whole day at a
time and that he had nearly 6>en over- .
come from exhaustion. The board did
not take up this matter yesterday, but it
will investigate along this line before
it concludes.
The testimony which revealed the' fact
that an active tratHc in tobacco and
stores was going on among the prison
ers was taken during the trial of Dr.
Devlin. Frank Smith, a. convicted bur
glar with twelve years yet to serve/gave
out' the evidence in a 'flurried answer to
the quick questions "of President Robert
Devlin of the board.
"The trusties stole food from, the mess,
and sold it to us,'" he declared. "Some of _
the things they took from the hospital.
Tobacco, steaks, butter and lard was
taken - from the stores. Socks were sto

â¢ One of the largest Saturday crowds of
eny season became worshipers at the
ehrine of Garnet Ferguson's brown
horse, Bearcatcher, after the Morello
handicap had been run yesterday at Oak
land track.
Before it was different, for San Nicolas,
the top weight, and Lady Goodrich, a
light weight, had a call over Bearcatch
er In the betting and In. the attention of
the public. The weights had been so
cleverly adjusted that Lady Goodrich,
which ultimately closed favorite, had 3
to 1 chalked about "^er naxna on the
Elates. Although Bearcatcher had oa
Tuesday tripped off a mile without ef
fort, it was supposed the additional fur
leng tacked on yesterday would prove
the stickler. From threes the brown
horse's price ascended to EVÂ£. *
Holtrnan dispatched the eight starters
perfectly aligned, with Bearcatcher and
his 117 pounds being sent out as the pace
maker hy McÃride.
BEAR CATCH Ell WELL BIDDEN.
There never appeared to be any doubt
as to the result. With seven furlongs
left behind, Davis could be o .served
urging San Nicolas. Lady Goodrich was
tinder full pressure and Lubin, Corn
Blossom. Bombardier and Bragg were out
of it. -'^'X
McÃride rated Bearcatcher to perfec
tion, and though San Nicolas responded
resolutely to persuasion, the Ferguson
entry flashed by the judges a 'handy win
ner by less than a length in 1:52, within
half a second of the coast record. It was
a remarkably fine performance, for the
track was far from being in a lightning
last condition. * *
For the favorites little can be said In
praise. They disappeared like corn cakes
in Jack Keene's kitchen! The rout waa
complete, a solitary choice failing to de
liver the merchandise.
Seven $30 horses started in the curtain
raiser over a mile, and Jackfull, quoted
profusely at sevens, led the way in. He
had F. Sullivan on his back, and racing
Eleven Bells into submission, beat the
mare a length. Barney Schreiber'B
three-year-old, Ed Sheridan, grabbed
chow honors at the last mlmite.
The favorite. Maid of Fermoy, ran last.
CALLAGHAN A DISAPPOINTMENT.
It took Just one minute, ten and a half
eeconds to transform Callaghan from a
Etake horse to a selling plater. After
his sensational exhibition of speed on
Thursday. James .Xealon's sprinter had
his name Inscribed on the roll of fame
along with Kingston. Fordham, Domino,
Dick Welles, and Sysonby. Now it has
been erased.
Callaghan met Fireball . at equal
weights in the Futurity course purse
event, and the books were loaded up at
2 to 5. At the start the favorite did not
appear to get away right foot first, while
Fireball slipped away in front. Soon
joined by the first choice, the pair raced
or. nearly equal terms Into the stretch.
Gradually, under Davis' riding, Fireball
drew away, winning easily at the wire.
Callaghan stopped perceptibly the last
sixteenth, failing to be placed. Conried,
a 50 to 1 shot, with Frank Otis up, nipped
Princess Wheeler a nose for the place.
WASniXGTOVS BAD RIDE.
Nothing could excell the exhibition
furnished by the colored rider, Wash
ington, on Blissful, favorite for the mile
end a furlong selling fixture. It left a
deep, dark brown taste in the mouth,
but it was novel from being so dif
ferent from other pyrotechnical dis
plays. Were Washington to have been
tried on the spot before. a tribunal of
the talent hanging would have been his
sentence. He did everything but throw
a natural, finally succeeding in finish-

VICTORY OF THE BLUE
WITNESSED BY THRONG
Crimson Eleven Show Unexpected^ Ability to
Solve and'to Stop Opponent 's; Attack.
/CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Nov. 25.â 8y her
quickness in seizing the opportunity
afforded 3by a muffled punt, . Yale won
the annual football game with Harvard
to-day by a score of 6 to 0. The error,
which was made by Nichols, who had
replaced Foster at left halfback', ocr
curred near the close of the second half,
and but for it, as even Yale. admitted, .
the contest, probably would have, re
sulted as did those oh the same field in'
IS?7 and 1599. 'in no score for either |
side. . - - f .
Harvard's unexepected ability -to
solve and stop- Yale's attack was the
feature of the contest. Except for one
dash of forty yards by Roome in the
first half and one of , fifteen yards by
Morse in the second half, the Yale gains
were short and nearly all were made
by plunges into the line. The Harvard <
gains . also resulted from mass plays,
usually with the famous tandem form
ation, the only exception being v
dash of IS yeards by Quarterback Starr,
who by running the whole width of the
field eluded Yale's ends for that dis
tance. Throughout the game end runs,
quarterback dashes and double and de
layed passes by either team were quick-
ly broken up, and frequently the runner
was thrown for a loss. Each; side had
to struggle time ami again for the nec
essary five yards. It usually took two
or three * downs to make the distance.
Yale captured* the ball three times, and
Harvard took the bajl away, from Yale
twice -by stubborn defense.
BUIIR MISSES GOAL, KICK. * ,
Harvard reached Yale's 24- yard
line in the half only to be
sent back five yard,s for off-side, play.
This was the nearest the crimson came
to scoring; a touchdown. 'In the flrssf
half, however. ;Burr' made a beautiful
attempt at goal from placement from
Yale's 51-yard line, missing it by a few
feet. (\u25a0,( ,-\u25a0 â¢ - \u25a0', \u25a0> i
Yale's score came in the last ten min
utes of play. I'he ball had gone up and
down the field with neither side able
to make any long consistent gains.
Hoyt 3ent a high punt to Nichols on
the Harvard 30-yard line. The Har
vard back.- who nutt just 'come' into. tho
game, muffed -the kick and Captain
Shevlin, who on ev*ery;kick during the
game was down the. held with marvel
ous speed, grabbed the ball the instant
it touched tho ground. Ya,le had twice
befcro held-. within Harvard's 25-yard
line, but Nichols' error seemed to sap
the fighting spirit of the crimson play
ers,, and in ten rushes Yale made the
distance 'to the 'goal line.^ Nearly all
the Yale plunges for- the score = wera
directed against the Harvard left'wing,
where Montgomery had replaced Brill,
notwithstanding the fact -that "'the
burly Harvard: tackle was able to run
oit the field comparatively fresh. Forbes
had the honor of carrying the ball over
for Yale's . only ; touchdown and Hoyt
kicked : an eaay goal from a punt out.
Neither side came within striking dis
tance of 1 , tho -other's goal after Yale
scored. . ,. * .' ;: â¢ . \
GATHERING IS BRILLIANT.
Forty-three thousand people watched
the game in weather as warm as* Indian
summer. It was the largest and most
brilliant gathering ever seen at a foot
ball game In this country. The spec
tators were keyed up to a high pitch of
excitement by the incessant cheering of
the tundergraduAtes, and the Harvard
stands, which contained fully 30,000
persons, after the team had shown It
self able to stop the Yale, offense and
displayed an ability to make short
gains, became overjoyed at the show
ing .of the crimson players. On the
other hand, the Yale team, until Hutch-
Inson replaced Tad Jones at quarter
back; seemed to luck the fighting spirit
which a week ago tore the Princeton
line to pieces. In the first half Har
vard gained many yards through Burr's
ability to outpunt Roome, but Burr fell
away in the second half and was In
turn, outpuntedi by .Hoyt, who took
Roome's place In the kicking. There
were few penalties, Yale suffering
three times and Harvard .three time 3
for off-side play. 1 Yale played nineteen
men and Harvard fifteen during , the
game. .
MANLY SPIRIT IS SHOWN.
One of the gratifying features
of the game was the spirit shown by
both sides toward each other, which
was emphasized .by the Yale stands
cheering : the 5 absent Harvard leader.
Captain Hurley, who was not able to
play on account of an injury which'
has confined him to a hospital In Boa
ton,; and the cheers for," Yale rrom the
crimson supporters. . '
After Harvard had won thÂ« toss and
had given Yale the" kick-off, with the
sun in the eyes of the blue players,
each team tried; the other's speed and
thenpunted, Burr gaining ten yards on
the exchange.; From Us -own thirty

down, principally by tandems, headed

XO SCORE IN FIRST HAX.F.
With Roome's run as an incentive and
urged on by the frantic 6houts of "Touch
down!" from the Yale side of the field,
the Yale back 3 threw themselves against
the crimson line three times, but gained
only four yards. The ball went to Har
vard for the second time on downs and
after Burr had kicked It out of danger
the half ended without a score.
After Yalo had returned Harvard's kick
off to the center of the field in the begin
ning of the second -half. Harvard began
another determined mnrch to the Yale
goal.' It ended, however, on the thlrty-ftve
yard line, where Burr was obliged to.

of the field, but was obliged'to kick from

started to regain the lost ground. This

the. team back five yards, but Starr more
than . regained ' the distance by his eight

ball outside of Yale's 60-yard line. Hoyt

upon the waiting Harvard back in time
to grab the ball as It slipped through

nailed, but It was Yale's ball on

It looks like- the real kind of dope
to break up a ball game In the last
two Innings. They are doing this regu
larly'at the Elghth-sfreet lot and yes
terday was no exception to the rule-
Before the dawn of the eighth spasm
the. fans would have wagered a good
gold brick against a phony peanut that
the Seals had the game In. Suddenly
the outlook assumed a different aspect
and the Tigers whisked victory away
from Uncle's tribe In Cakewalk meas
sure,
Hltt, who was pitching the kind of
ball that generally . winds up with a
shutout, became suddenly afflicted with
the Jimmies. Doyle hit to center and
Shea let the next one go through him
for a passed ball. Sheehan immediate
ly dispatched a single . to left, and, of
course, Doyle arrived. Kordyke un
loaded a double-cushion shot against
the - center field fence which produced
another run. Eagan had only a fly to
Gochnauer, but ho dropped It and Nor
dyke arrived. Casey saw the Seals
were up in the higher altitudes and he
laid one down. It was easy to beat out
and as no one covered the home plate
Eagan sneaked In.
That put the big seal of victory on
the Tigers' banner. They had nothing
more to worry about* for the Seals
could not get Jerry to any kind of a
curve In the next two Innings. They
had only one man on the bases after
the eighth and he never figured like a
headliner In the going.
Had Mike Fisher allowed Emerson
to remain in the box there might have
been a different finish. But - that Old
talk of what might have been does
not go even In baseball. Mike saw
that Emerson did not have a thing, so
he chased him from the mound after
the Seals had piled up three runs and
five hits In two Innings. Brown then
came In and twisted 'em over - with
Euch cleverness that the Seals did not
present a dangerous aspect after that
time. The score:

POOR GAME AT SACRAMENTO.
Seattle and Oakland Play Ragged Ball
at the Capital City.

slzed Saturday afternoon crowd in

afternoon to see the Seattle and the
Oakland teams of the Pacific Coast
League give an Imitation of \u25a0 the na
tional game. The contest was lop
sided to an extent not seen here since
Mike Fisher's men left the paternal
roof and became Tacoma wanderers, in
search of a crowd. Seattle took fif
teen, Oakland three runs, but to even
up matters Oakland took six errors

for the Angels, but retired after seven
hits and as many runs were gathered
by the Webfeet.\ Goodwin, who suc
ceeded him, fared no better and six
more runs* were added. The local team
resembled a "bush" aggregation some
what, with an amateur catcher and ah
amateur shortstop, an outfielder at sec

Morris McLoughlin Captures
Tennis Tropliy "for the
Third Successive Time
BECOMES HIS PBOPEBTY
Champion Beals C. Wright
Entertained by Admirers
at an Elaborate Banquet
j Two tennis tournaments were played
on the public courts at Golden Gate
Park yesterday. The boys of the Gold
len Gate .Junior ; Club ; finished their
scratch singles tournament, which was
commenced last Saturday. < As was ex
pected/ Morris McLoughlln again car
ried ofldthe honors. ; The Thanksgiving
day handicap' mixed doubles -tourna
ment was commenced " ; on the' public
courts- and some Interesting matches
were played.
: McLoug hlln's victory makes three
straight and the . handsome .cup, which
Is emblematic of ', the club -champion
ship, goes ' to " the "winner f or .* all time.
McLoughlin had a . much' harder* time
than usual, twice being forced to play
three-set . matches. For the third time
McLoughlin and Harold Getz came to
gether in the finals.
Gets took the first set from the cham
pion and it seemed the latter -.would
meet defeat for the .first time. {Mc-
Loughlin, however, pulled, himself to
gether in the second and third seta and
won them Quite handily.
. McLoughlin missed defeat by a nar
row margin at the hands '. of Robert
Strachan. They met In the semi-finals
and-, the j champion was hard . ' pressed,
throughout. " . -
When the score stood set all and 5-5
the spectators began |to wonder If the
champion would meet defeat at :;;: the
hands ,\u25a0 of his clever young opponent.
Strachan did his best, but McLoughlin
was a trifle too strong for him.; - : . t
Three matches were "played In the
mixed doubles tournament and all .were
close and Interesting.
In the preliminary round Miss Ethel
RatclliTe and Charles Dunlap, one of
the most heavily handicapped teams,
beat Miss A. Greenberg and Guy Lyt
ton. The latter received a handicap of
(owe 30 and 3-6).
It was* by far the best match of the
day. Miss Ratcliffe won two sets out
of .throe, all of which were close. . -
In the first round Miss Golda Myer
and George Janes (owe 15 8-6). beat
Miss V. Crocker and G. Baker (owe 15).
Miss Mearns and C. Foley (owe 15)
beat Miss , Vodden and R. N. Whitney
(owe 15 8-6) in straight sets. Both of
the winning teams are in the 'semi
finals of the lower half.
In the upper half Miss Hotchkiss and
C. Grlffln (owe 80) will" meet Miss
Hotchkiss and Dunlap and 'Mrs.'' Nei
meyer and E. Flnnegan (3^6)^. will meet
Miss Weed :and F. Adams (scratch).

INNOCENT MAN
IN BRITISH JAIL
Sent to Prison for Theft,
but Eeal Culprit Later
Confesses to the Crime
BOTH GIVEN SENTENCES
BpÂ«clal Dispatch to The Call.
LONDON, Nov. >5.-^-Two 'men are at
present undergoing \u25a0 sentences of eight
een â¢ months', hard : labor in British -Jails
for a crime of which It Is certain that
one of them must be Innocent .The
case affords another striking Illustra
tion of the travesties of Justice which
British j' law sanctions,' and which the
best lawyers are agreed can be rem
edied only by the establishment of a
Court of Criminal /Appeal Huch aa ex
ists In all the States In America. .
In March last . James Flynn wai ar
restedon a charge of having snatched
a watch ' from a . Mr. Seme In ; '. Kensal
road. The evidence against' him was by
no means 'conclusive and " he stoutly
protested 'his: Innocence,' but he was
found guilty. ' and ; sent to ; prison for
eighteen months with: hard labor. '
Two weeks ago John Doyle, . a young
fellow of 25, who had been convicted sev
eral times of . theft. ;. voluntarily ; surren
dered . himself to the police and 'con
fessed that , he had stolen : Seme's watch. 1

out of . Jail, and was quite prepared to
take his place.
At the last Clerkenwell sessions Doyle
reiterated . his confession, but the police
declared their belief that It was untrue
and had been made solely for the purpose
of securing Judicial clemency In Flynn's
behalf. \u25a0 ...
Eventually the case was postponed for
further â¢" investigation. * Doyle was ar
raigned again recently. The prosecuting
attorney stated that* the investigation,
which bad been ; made , by . the ' police on
behalf of - the home offlee. - had . only
strengthened their conviction that Doyle
was not " guilty of the ' theft of which, he
accused himself.. Whoever, stole the
watch, â¢ they were certain it was not
Doyle. Had they taken any other view.
It would, of course, j haf c been tanta
mount to an acknowledgment that they
had procured the conviction of an inno
cent man. Anyhow the matter stood with
the j police protesting that Doyle was In
nocent and Doyle declaring himself guil
ty. : The only; evidence against him was
his own confession. . , "
"After due reflection do you still adhere
to your "statement?" observed the Judge,
Mr. Loveland-Loveland, to Doyle.
"Yes, I do," said the prisoner firmly.
?Tou say you are guilty?"
â¢Tes, sir."
s "What else have you to sayT".
."Nothingâ except that I Flynn Is . inno
cent." \u25a0- \u25a0 / : - : 'â¢â¢'\u25a0\u25a0. '\u25a0 ".. .. ; ... .
The sapient Judge, ; whose decision does
not admit â¢ of ; revision, 'J. then . sentenced
Doyle to eighteen monms' hard labor, the
same sentence that had been passed on
Flynn.i No consideration .whatever was
shown Doyle because he had voluntarily
surrendered himself to save another man
from punishment. \
V His sacriflce Is without avail. If the
Judge's assumption - that he Is really
guilty . Is correct. Flynn is innocent.
Flynn Btlll continues to serve his sen
tence. \ The only course open to \u25a0 him is
to appeal to ! . the home â¢ office and â¢ the
home â¢ office, having put on record its
opinion: that Doyle did not steal \u25a0 the
watch,' will . not stultify - itself by par
doning the man who was first convict

NEWS OF THE COUNTIES ABOUT THE BAY
NEWS OF DEATH
WRECKS REASON
When the Remains of Walter
Bertin Reach Oakland for
Burial Father Is Maniac
BODY LIES UNCLAIMED
Search of Express Company
Leads to Insane Ward of
the . Receiving Hospital
OAILuaND, Xov. 25.â Constant brood
ing over the death of bis boh. Walter
Berlin, who died after several years of
service in the United States navy, has
dethroned the reason of Felix Bertln. and
tw-day the grief-stricken father was re
moved to the insane ward of the Be
utlviiai Hospital, while the body of the
ton lies unclaimed at the office of Well*.
} argo & Co.
Alter receiving the news Bertlu asked
that the body of his 6on, who died at
Fort Bayard. N. M.. be sent to this city
lor burial, but before the arrival of the
remains, grief had conquered reason.
For three days the body of Walter Ber
lin has lain at the local office of the ex
press company, awaiting the coming
or the father. Finding the body un
claimed on the second day after Us ar
rival at the Oakland office, the officials
of the express company yesterday bega.n
a search for the father and to-day found
him in the hospital.
Waiter Berlin entered^ the service of
the Government several "years ago, and
after serving at Mare Island for some
time was ordered to Japan, where he
\u25a0was stricken with a fatal illness, and
was invalided home. In a last effort to
pave his life, he was sent to Fort Bay
ard, where he died. His father had just
been discharged from the County In
firmary, and asked that the body be sent
to him for burial. The Government cent
the body to Oakland by express.
The Insane father has a brother, an up
holsterer, residing in Oakland. It is ex
pected that he will take charge of the
funeral of his nephew.
LAWYERS ABUSE EACH
OTHER IN AFFIDAVITS
Attorneys Wilson and Chap
man Indulge in Warfare
by Document.
OAKLAND, Nov. 25.â As the result of
animosities enuendered in the trial of a
hard-fought damage suit a spirited tilt
between Attorney C. H. Wilson of San
Francisco and Attorney M. C. Chapman,
ore of the leading lawyers- practicing
ot the Alameda County bar, has found
vent in affidavits filed by the respective
attorneys in regard to a motion made for
a new trial by Attorney Wilson for his
client. -. .;:-^:..i-c:
In hi* affidavit giving notice of his in
tended motion, Wilson states that his
client was prevented from getting a fair
trial on account of the misconduct and ir
regularities practiced by Attorney Chap
man and charges him with having asked
improper Questicns of the jurors.
To-day Attorney Chapman filed his an
swer, in which he takes exception to the
statements made by Wilson, and in this
connection says: "Attorney Wilson has
set forth a garbled and false statement
and account of the things which took
place upon the trial of the cause in ques
tion. His conduct during the trial was
Insolent, insulting and overbearing, and
that the design of said Wilson in setting
forth herein, as purported, statements so
disconnected from the language actually
used by this affiant upon said trial was
and is calculated to mislead and deceive
the court."
The cause referred to by attorneys in
their affidavits was one in which Claude
Assalena sued the People's Express Com
pany for damages sustained by being
dragged from an Alameda car, on which
he was seated, by the whiffletree of the
People's Express Company's wagon. The
jury returned a verdict in favor of As
ealena for JlO.OOO. The case was bitterly
fought on both sides and at the termina
tion of the trial It is stated that Wilson
said that he would never try another case
in* Alameda County. He, however, 'ap
peared in court a few days ago and com
promised a suit in which clients of his
were interested. ~
GAMBLERS WILL, FIGHT.
OAKLAND, Nov. 5. â The efforts of
the police to stamp out the percentage
poker games in Oakland have resulted
in raids of three places where poker
is played and in all thirteen players
have been arrested. The gamblers,
however, intend to make a light and
the police confess that, there is little
evidence against the men. In order to
procure evidence it is necessary to have
at least two witnesses to play to prove
that the game was conducted on the
percentage basis. The gamblers have
retained Attorney A. L. Frick to de
fend them and attack the legality of
the arrests. The places raided, were
those of Link Denis, at Seventh and
Wood streets; Frank Pereira, at Eighth
and Washington streets, and H. J. Cor
der of 455 Eighth street. -
CONTRACTOR DISAPPEARS.
BERKELEY. Nov. 25.â Arthur Ho
way, a contractor and housebullder, has
left town without warning and with
his business affairs in an unsettled con
dition.
Howay had an office at 2065 Center
street. Several property owners called
thers to-day after being informed of
Howay's disappearance, each reporting
that Uoway has left buildings uncom
pleted. Herman Bredlow, . a former
partner of the missing man, says Ho
way purchased his interest in the firm
several weeks ago tor $400. but has not
paid over the money.

ROADS DRAG DRAYMEN
INTO THEIR CONTEST
Battle Over the Use
of Third Street Is
Hotly Waged.
Southern Pacific and
Rival Both Appeal \u0084
to Teamsters.
OAKLAND. Nov. 2S.â The Dairymen' 8
and Expressmen's Association has been
drawn into the battle which i has opened
between the Southern Pacific Company
and the Western Pacific Company over
the proceedings started in the City Coun
cil to open Third street, between Union
and Kirkham. While on the surface. the
conditions appear to be only a matter of
street opening, the Western Pacific Rail
road people declare their rivals are try
ing to force them to show their hand with
reference to their plans for the Western
Pacific terminal on the water front.
Tha Western Pacific's franchise through
Third street ends at Union street. At
that Junction the company, to reach Its
lands on the estuary shore, will be com
pelled to cross Third street, and the ques
tion at point is whether the engineers will
decide upon an underground, overhead ot
grade crossing. There have been no of
ficial grades established on Third street
west of Union, and the Western. Pacific
engineers do not desire that the "street
ehall be graded until their plans for reach-
Ing their terminal shall have been com
pleted.
BATTLE FOB A STREET.
On the other hand, the . Southern Pa
cific representatives have declared that
the opening of Third street is necessary
In order that teams may conveniently
drive to the new freight sheds at Fifth
and Kirkbam streets, which are a block
west and two blocks north of the cross
ing at Third and Union streets. The or
dinance establishing the grade was be
fore the City Council committee last
wnek. After discussion. In which Charles
E. Snook, attorney for the Western Pa
cific Company, and J. E. Foulds of ; the
Southern Pacific Company' took part,
hearing was continued a week
Now both parties have started ' a .cam
paign among the draymen! 'Ttuj i Southern
Pacific people have sent a representative
among the employing teamsters present^
ing arguments why -they should; sign a
petition In favor of the proposed ordi
nance. This move has been met by the
new company.
BUSY WITH THE DRAYMEX.
As a result the draymen are being
pulled and hauled until a merry ' contest
has 4rveloped among them.
Th'i Southern Pacific argument to the
teamsters is that by opening Third street
they will have easy ingress and egress to
the Southern Pacific freight station. The
Western Pacific agents insist that ample
facilities will be afforded if Fifth street
be improved. They declare that by open
ing Third street between Kirkham and
Union streets their projects may be in
terfered with, and they assert that. the
Southern Pacific Company is trying to
block them %t that important point.
The Western Pacific owns the land on
each side of Third street, between Union
and Kirkham, running .south ,to the bay
shore and north to Fifth i street.
So seriously do the new comers view
the controversy that -they have instructed
Virvll Borge, chief engineer of the West
ern Pacific Company, to return . from Salt
Lake as soon as possible in order to be
present at the next 'meeting of the Coun
cil committee.

ABOUT MURDER
OAKLAND, Nov. 25. T -George Blaker,

Thomas Cook at Frultvale, says he in
tends to tell .ill he knows in re sard to
the crime: if called as a witness in the
prosecution of Percy; Pembroke or John
Schneider, who were implicated with
him in the assault on Cook. That his

of Attorney L. S> Church, who Is 'de
fending Percy Pembroke.
Blaker said,, ' The story Pembroke and
Schneider huve told about the murder
of Cook is partly right and partly
wrong:. In the main, however, it? is
correct. If- 1 am called as a witness I
shall tell whole thing, as I have
nothing: to gain or lose. My story will
be a little dliierent than theirs, a but
no one knows what it is going to be. I
shall not tell an,y one until 1 get on the
stand." â¢\u25a0 , *- â¢\u25a0' \u25a0.--. -^s;h
In regard to a story that Blaker bad
told about James Crowhurst having set

the name of John Spyskie ' In- Dlmond
Canyon, Sheriff Barnet said to-day: ;"It
is in keeping witha/ lot of wild stories
Crowhurst told to his companions to
inspire their awe.- The story of his
killing a Chinaman was another. Iran
the, story down after, talking to Crow
hurst about it and found some people
with whom he had gone to the fire.'
Spyskie was burned, but Crowhurst had
nothing to do with it."
The trial of the case was
on until noon. to-day, when an adjourn
ment was taken until Monday.'" Dep
uty Sheriff IteJlly was called as a wit
ness and identified some of the cloth
ing down in Blaker's house and other

SAUSALITO,; Nov. 25.â A mass-meet
ing the citizens of. Sausalito to-night
unanimously advised the Town v Trustees
to grant a valuable franchise to F. L.
Evans, who Is representing the California
Inland j and ' Eastern Railroad Company.
It was the largest gathering, of citizen*
ever held in the Town Hall. More than
three hours was consumed by Evans and
the numerous speakers.. The meeting was
called to order by Town Trustee Plstolesl,
who introduced Temporary .Chairman C.
H. Becker and Temporary Secretary; F.
D. Llnsley.;- Chairman Becker spoke
briefly, telling the objects' of the meeting
and then | called on Mr. Evans to tell the
audience of. his' proposition. .
- Evans traced , the course of the proposed
road over a map and showed different dis
tricts to be traversed by \u25a0 the road that
would contribute > goods for shipment . to
the coast. The road will leave Sausalito
and run to Al turns, in Modoc County,
there to connect with a branch running to
Eureka and tapping, the rich lumber dis
tricts of Humboldt. Evans has an op
tion on a thlrty-flve-mile road out of Eu-,
reka. . . " â¢ ' . . ' : . , '
From Alturas the road will be divided
into two routes, both running through
rich southern Oregon and gradually di
verging. One line will pass through Boise
City and both will meet at Vale, Idaho,
and terminate at' Caspar. Wyoi. where. the
Chicago and North western ends. ThiÂ«
proposed road will â¢ have no connection
with- the Chicago arid Northwestern.
Evans stated that he had received as
high as a $100,000 bonus and valuable
acreage from Caldwell, Idaho, and simi
lar bonuses from other places. He could
not and would not. he said, consent to
place any bond as a guarantee of good
faith, a* it was wot railroad etiquette. "
Much \ of ; the land on the line ; of the
proposed road \u25a0 is Trlch agricultural . an<j
mineral' land owned principally jj by thÂ«
Government. It has .been â¢ lying dormant
because of lack of transportation facili
ties. Among the principal resources are
coal, borax, live stock, nitre, potash,
grain and lumber./ Evans was subjected
to a vigorous cross-examination, and he
pledged his word that he was not In the
service of the Southern Pacific.
Town . Trustee while not
averse ; to the new" railroad, said he was
against - Granting them the concession
unless a bond executed aa a guarantee
of good faith, yras'givenr; ,"
George. A. Storey, cashier of the Cali
fornia Bank, also opposed the franchise,
saying that the " land needed was very
valuable. He called; attention' to the
scarcity of deep water- sites. -He - said the
Southern ( Pacific ; paid . $5000 an \u25a0 acre" f*r
tide, land a few days ago. ...... "
D. T. Tilllnghast of the Sauaalito Land
and Ferry Company, ', A. B. Roberts, a
well known railway contractor; A. E.
Wray, Paul Vincnione, George H. Harlan
and others . spoke for the franchise and
Harlan introduced the following resolu
tion: ..../. ..
"Resolved. That It Is the sense of this
meeting that the Town Trustees be ad
vised that the fanchlse applied for by
Mr. Evans shoulu be granted under such
safeguards and restrictions as the Town
Trustees see. flt, always securing to the
people free and unhampered access to the
water and on the condition that work on
the road Is commenced" within one year
and 200 miles o^tbe road completed. and
placed In operation within three years."
The resolution was unanimously adopt
ed. Mr. Evans thanked the audience, as
suring them of his sincerity.

POSTAL REFORM
HIS LIFE WORK
Special Dispatch' to The Call.
_ LONDON, Nov. 25.â 1t is generally
conceded that If John Hennlker Heaton,
whose latest efforts in behalf of the es
tablishment of a universal penny (2-cent)
postage have attracted such widespread
attention, had received the reward his
achlevments deserve, he- would long ago
have been made Postmaster General. But
that office is conferred here for political
reasons and not for business ability and
expert knowledge.' of its duties. A grate
ful people have dubbed the member of
Parliament for Canterbury . "the Postmas
ter General of Greater Britain" and prob
ably .Heaton regards that as a greater
compliment than the plain official title
now borne by Lord Stanley. Heaton is not
only the practical creator of imperial
penny postage, but has done more than
any man living to secure to the world the
fullest possible advantages of cheap pos
tal, telegraphic and telephonic communi
cation.
The ancients used to say, "Beware of
the man of one book." Heaton is the
man of one idea.. the reform. of the post
offlce, of whom statesmen and adminis
trators are In dread, for all his energy
and. resolution are concentrated upon the
attainment of this object. The red tape
bound officials of St. Martin's Le Grand.
the ' headquarters of the British Postof
fice Department. . have tried time . and
again to trip him in his facts, but they
have never yet succeeded. He knows more
about the business. Inside and out, than
all of them put together.
Heaton says the proudest moment
of. his life was tn July, ISO 3. when, on
one of the hottest of hot days, the Lord
Mayor and Sheriffs of London, in scarlet
and fur, and the Common Councilors, in

gathered in state in the Guildhall for the
express purpose of presenting to him, in
a wonderful gold box,; the solemn docu
ment . granting him the freedom of .the
city. It Is air honor reserved for the
greatest benefactors of .the country, and
it was bestowed In this case because
Heaton had pounded away at his idea' of
making .a penny carry a letter from, any
part ' of \u25a0 the British empire to any other
part of It until he had won tbe victory.
His great ambition since then has been
to bring about the adoption of the penny
postage between \u25a0 Great - Britain and the
United States, and be Is confident that it
will be realized.
It is this extraordinary , man's , boast
that he knows every postofflce of Im
portance in the world. There Is scarce
ly, a corner of the globe that he did not
visit when he began his Imperial penny
poet crusade. One of his striking;
achievements was to - arrange a chess
match, played 1 , by. cable, between mem
bers of . Congress "\u25a0 in the - eapltol at
Washington and members of Parlia
ment in London. A resolution of thanks
was '< cabled over from Washington and
Just one :-' minute , later the House of
Commons passed a similar resolution.
; Heaton 'ls 57 ' years old. After grad
uating from King's College," London, he
made his way to Australia, where he
became a land owner and a. newspaper
editor, and married Miss Rose Bennett,
one. of .the loveliest ' women In Aus
tralia. -He was astrldeof his hobby; as
long ago as 18S5, when he represented
the Tasmania Government at the Berlin
telegraph | conference. . \u25a0 In . that same
year^ he : was elected to Parliament
from Canterbury. He has been respon
sible for the cheap ; parcel post system,
for. the' introduction ; of telegraph money

SOCIAL PURITY
IS HIS HOBBY
LOXDON. Nov. 25.â 1f the Bishop Â»t
London, had not sat upon him hard, atj^
recent meeting of the Society for tha Tt.]W
motion of Public Morality, we . should
have heard from the lips of â¢ Samuel
Smith. M. P., a scathing denunciation
of low-necked dresses as promoters 'ot
moral depravity. He thinks that they
should be prohibited by act of Parlia
ment. But because their gracious â¢ Maj
esties insist on a generous display ol
feminine charms at their court functions,
the loyal bishop vetoed the subject, fear
ing that discussion upon it might Involve
their sacred persons In hoatlla criti
cism.
But nobody ever succeeded In suppress)
Ing Samuel Smith. M. P., Ions;. HÂ» la
sure to find an opportunity soon to ven
tilate his views on the pernicious Influ
ence of decollete dresses. It will make
no difference. No woman will stop wear
ing them because Samuel Smith, M. P..
objects. Nor will his enthusiasm be one
whit diminished In consequence. Popu
lar approval or disapproval counts for
nothing with him. Ha Is convinced that
society needs a* lot of reforming, partic
ularly in this modern Babylon, and that
it Is his chief mission to reform It. ,
Smith is a tall, spare man. slightly bent
with the burden of his sixty-nine years.
He wears a long, straggling beard. -of
yellowish gray, and his hair Is Iron gray.
His eyes are Urge and blus, and his face
wear a an habitual expression of the pro
foundest melancholy due to his conviction
that things generally are going to the
"demnltion bow-wows." Absorbed la bto
gloomy thoughts, * be* walks along
street with such an air. ot > abstraction
that he rarely notices a passing friend
until he is actually stopped and greeted.
He .was born In Scotland, but though he
was early transplanted to England -he
has : never acquired any measure of '-the
saving grace of humor. Â«,He started In
business In Liverpool as a cotton broker
in 1860, and so thoroughly mastered tbe
ways of mammon that he was able to re
tire a score of years . ago ; with an â¢ in
come of something like $130,000 a year.
Then he got astride of his hobbyâ social
purityâ and has been riding it hard ever
since. He was elected to Parliament
from Flintshire. In North ' Wales, in tSSS.
and 'has succeeded In; retaining hi.*' seat
at each - subsequent election.
Occasionally, . .with .apocalyptic, vehe
mence that 1 consorts 111 with . his piping
and querulous voice,; he treats 'the House
Of Commons to his .views on . modern " de
cadence. Though. he> boasts that he has
never entered the doors of : a theater in
his , life, that fact did not deter him.' a
few; years ago, from embarking on ' thÂ«
stormy sea of dramatic criticism and arg
ing Parliament -to put a stop to .such
plays ' as" "Zaza" and \ "Tae 'Gay Lord
Quex." It proved a good ' advertisement
for them. As president of ' the Purity
Society it has been * Smith's fate to
study more impure literature than any
other man in England. ~He is down on
gambling, of course. . though ' the* firm hÂ»
fnrndfd "speculates* freely; ln futures.".
I Despite his * great 'wealth he i*. a ; man

yesterday morning by Policemen Ma
honey and'Helns on a charge of rob
bing May Calwell, who occupies a room
at 361 Sutter street. The woman ;al
leges'that early, yesterday morning, he
whipped out a razor and demanded $50.
She gave him, $30. which she had in
her room, and â¢.went to, the "night clerk
and got $20 which she had on deposit

â¢ Policemen Hems arid Mahoney were
notified by a messenger boy, who had
been summoned ; by ' the woman, of the
robbery, and they went to her room
and released her. They took her to the

man who .robbed _ me.' V Smith was
promptly arrested."
It was thought that Smith was the

Are you one of th* many who has often
heard of BurlinKame, bat have never visited
It? If so. It will pay you to take a pleasant
and- profitable trip to-day and look at the
lots we are selling so fast ' In - Burllngam'*
Park.
WÂ» . have had the most remarkable sale of
lots ever made tn the vicinity of San Fran-
cisco. The reasons for this sale are apparent
to any thinking man. They are, in short:
Burllngam* is th* closest to San Francisco
:in point of time . and distance of any real
' desirable suburb. . It has as good a climate as
; can b* found anywhere tn thÂ» world. Land ia
; selling now for prices several time*, leas than
property In other suburbs not so desirable. t
â¢ In Burllngam* Park you secure at a small
cost the combined effo-ts-'of brains and cap-
Hal expended for the past 23 years. This
park was not made tn a das. It was laid
out 25 years ago and roads were built and
; trees planted, the latter having attained their
full growth and beauty.
The property lies close to the etectria tar
Itne already built (not a . prospect} and you
'also have the train service which now takes
only 38 minutes and which most other property
down the peninsula does not enjoy. \u25a0 You have
also the certainty that the Bay Shore cutoff
will reduce th* railroad time to 23* minutes In
the â¢ near future. There are no ferry-boats
needed to reach Burltngame or any trans-
ferring. It Is as close -to the business center
of San Francisco as many of the residence
sections of San Francisco.
Its natural beauty and unsurpassed climate
wilt attract thousands In the near future. In
fact, the tide has set toward Burllnsramo and
it has already made a start for great Im-
provement. . ' . -*v*flL \u25a0

to live and It presents a -moat unusuat oppor-

New York Cotton' Market.
NEW YORK, -â¢ Nov. 25. â The future course
of the market will be Influenced a very great
extent by '-. what the forthcoming Government
report will show. The Secretary 'of Agrioulture
went en record In \u25a0 analyzing- the ' conditions of
the report of Cs.B. which the Bureau announced
November 10 - - certainly : Indicating .a - crop
over 10.000,000 bales. If the coming report es
timates the yield at about 10,500,000 bales the
trade will' regard It as bullish and as indicat
ing ultimately higher prices, and the world's
eplnners will then no doubt be . willing to lay
in the rest of their season's supplies. \u25a0
The Commercial ,says: \u25ba There were Indica
tions that there was an agreement - between
some of t*ie strongest * men in the market to
go after the big Wall street long Interest, and
It was freely predicted that there' would be a
break this week that would force liquidation.
A great many messages were- received; yester
day from all parts of the belt to the effect that
the farmers were holding.- It is on this hold l
ing movement that the bulls put their faith.
On tlie other hand, the week-end statements
were bearish, showing that more cotton came
Into sight this week than during the same
week of last year. '

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Nov.\ 25.â The wheat -market
opened at a slight - decline, the May op
tion being off %Â©ii<s to %c,afB6% to 86%Â©
87c. Pit traders and commission, houses were
moderate sellers. - Bearish : sentiment was ; due
chiefly to tbe liberal " movement of new .wheat
in .the: Northwest, '^by.?- clear
weather ( In that section of the v country.':" . The
la rge ' deliveries *at Minneapolis ; and Duluth
caused a considerable decline in the , price \u25a0of
wheat \u25a0on the curb \u25a0at Minneapolis, and tola
decline *In '\u25a0: turn s had ; a ;â¢ , tendency ". to â¢ depress
prices here. . News regarding , the wheat > crop
of Argentina was conflicting. Advices received
early in the day were : to the . effect that esti
mates on the crop were being greatly reduced.'
These reports brought out . a fair demand, ; re-
EuHlnjj in a slleht rally, \u25a0 sales of May " being
made at 87% c. Later a message from Buenos
Ayres ttated , that ; the \u25a0 damage by. frost was
Blight and that It ' would have ' no \ perceptible
effect on the wheat>crop.i This clew of the sit
uation In . the South 'American \u25a0 republic practi
cally dispelled all bullish aentiment and caused
a recurrence of the . early weakness. Large
primary \u25a0 receipts were an additional bearish
Influence, affecting, the market. late in the ses
sion. During the day, the . price : of . May de
clined to" 86% c. â¢ The close, was, easier, %c

The feature of the market yesterday was
the break in Eggs.- ,' The - recent : littht rains
and - the \u25a0 sunnier \u25a0 weather have rendered both
buyers and sellers very bearish on the situa
tion; and the former are taking no more than
a day's supply, at a time, while the latter are
shading the quotations to sell. -It is the usual
reaction : after - a period of .very high prices.
Receipts of ranch are not heavy, but the sup
ply on the market Is slowly increasing, which
increases the weakness.' -
Butter and Eggs were unchanged and both
were in light supply \u25a0 and quoted firm.'
