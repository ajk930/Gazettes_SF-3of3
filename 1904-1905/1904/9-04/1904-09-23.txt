ST. LOUIS, Sept. 22.â Great interest
has been aroused in the International
Congress of Arts and Science by the
theory advanced by Professor Hugo de
Vries, professor- of botany in the Uni
versity of Amsterdam, who, combat
ting in the open Darwin's theory of the
origin of species, advanced a theory of
his own in diametrical opposition to
all ideas of former and present biolo
gists and phylogenists.
Professor de Vries asserts that - no
two of the same species of animal,
from the lowest stages to man, are
alike in any important particular.' . He
claims that the distinguishing feature
or element of- an .individual- Is* -not
transmitted to the offspring of that in
dividual. The' theory of Darwin, on
the other hand, is that by heredity the
peculiarities' of the primogenitor finally,
result in a new species. --i :?*,Â«-' ",
Professor de 'Vries offered proof be
fore the scientists that an entirely new
species may be .developed within one
or two generations.

Professor Howard said that -at the

pended upon marriage. The home was

through "selfishness, were made wage
earners. -Professor' Howard asserted
that : the. marriage .ties: are at present
too ' lightly - made ,; and too . easily

Th* bullet did not strike the Chief of i

about to fire again when he was seized :
by Prince Obelonsky.
The man's weapon fell to the ground
and a desperate struggle ensued, in the j
course of which Neidgart was wound
ed in the hand with a dagger. The as
sailant was finally secured and placed
in custody. He refused to give his
name or any account of himself.
ST. PETERSBURG. Sept. 22.â In

lice Neidgart. in company with Prince

WASHINGTON. Sept. 22.â President
Roosevelt and party arrived here over
the Pennsylvania Railroad from Oyster
Bay at 6:52 o'clock this afternoon.
The President's train was delayed
about thirty-six minutes by an acci
dent to the rear drive wheel of the lo
comotive as It entered the tunnel at
Baltimore. The engine was imme
diately detached and another procured
to pull the train to "Washington.
Fortunately the train was not run
ning at high speed when the accident
occurred, or it might have been more
serious. It was making not more than
thirty-five miles an hour, when in some
unaccountable manner the tire of the
rear drive wheel on the left, side of the
engine broke and curled off. One end
of it protruded upward and jammed
through the boiler of the engine, caus
ing an almost immediate shutting off
of the steam. Engineer Weatherby put
on the airbrakes and the train came to
a stop. A request was sent to the yard
for another engine. After a half-hour'a
delay another engine was attached to
the train and It proceeded to Wash
ington.
The cause of the tire breaking, ac
cording to the railway officials, was
Inexplicable. The engine, just before
leaving . Philadelphia, had been thor
oughly I tested. The -President and his
party took the matter very coolly.
The accident is said to be the first
which has happened to a train on
which President Roosevelt has traveled
during his administration.*
The President was given a cordial
welcome home by a large crowd of peo
ple as he came through the trainshed
and walked out to the street where his
carriage was waiting. The crowd lined
both sides of Sixth street for a long
time before the train arrived, and when
he made his appearance and stepped
into his carriage he was enthusiastic
ally cheered.

American ideal in those sterling qualities
which appeal to the soldier as well as the citi
zen.

said:
"Such an era of prosperity as was
never before witnessed in history has
been accorded to this country by Re

such cordial feeling for California the

has been visiting relatives at 601
Temple street, in this city, is' at the
California Hospital suffering from se
rious injuries, which will confine her
to her bed for many weeks. She
owes her U f e to the fact that she is
unusually fleshy, and to that fact
her cousin also owes her life.
The two young women, one fat and
the other lean, slept. in a folding-bed.
This morning as they were about to
arise the bed collapsed in such a man
ner that the folding part fell, catch
ing Miss Galway on the neck and
shoulders and pinning her so that she
was unable to move. Her cousin
was hardly touched by the bed be
cause she was so slender. She man

two men to release Miss Galway, who
was unconscious.

WILLOTVS, Sept. 22. â Judge Pirkey
to-day decided a case ofr more than
usual importance, owing to the promi
nence of the parties involved and the
large issues at stake. A suit was
brought by. Mary Flood against
Charles Templeton, administrator of
the estate of James Sullivan, deceased,
to enforce the specific performance of
a contract. The plaintiff prayed to
have awarded to her a ranch valued
at $15,000 and the case has just been
decided in her favor.
Sullivan formerly made his home
with the Floods and became indebted
to them to the extent of many thou
sand dollars. Mrs. Flood purchased
the ranch in question and made part
payment on the same. She mort
gaged the. property to Sullivan for the
balance due. The payments being in
arrears, Sullivan brought suit to fore
close the mortgage, which was allowed
by Mrs. Flood without protest, with
the understanding that Sullivan would
on his death bequeath the ranch to
her. Sullivan has since died and the
suit was brought to force the adminis
trator to perform .the clause in the
contract. N -

As a result of the exposure her condi
tion to-night is critical. - r ' :
The City Board of Health published
to-day a long open letter to the Super
visors. It is a scathing document, and
demands fr,om the Supervisors a ruling
on the question of "whether a resident
of Shasta County and not of the cit>
of Redding, nor domiciled therein, but
passing- through our streets, and af
flicted with a contagious disease, is or
is not entitled to medical care and
treatment in the county pesthouse."
Special Dispatch to The .Call.
Captain Shubert and four Buriat
Cossacks have returned from a long
Â»cout south of the Japanese main army.
The captain brings important informa
tion regarding the Japanese locations
end movements and says extensive
operations in this vicinity probably will
develop within a fe'w days. Captain
Shubert experienced great kindness at
the hands of Chinese, who fed him and
his men and offered to disguise them
la Chinese clothing. This, however, was
not necessary-, as the party eluded the
Japanese pickets, passing within a few
yards of one. and reached the Rus
eian lines in safety.
The surgeon of one of the Siberian
regiments, who was captured at Liao
yang, has arrived here. The Japanese
found him attending to the wounded.
They treated him well, entertained him
at a concert in the famous Liaoyang
eummer garden and offered him a po
eition as surgeon in the Japanese army.
Finding that he preferred his own regi
ment, the Japanese good-naturedly es
corted him to the lines and allowed him
to return to Mukden.
The weather has suddenly turned
cold. The supply of uniforms is in
adequate and the soldiers are being
supplied with Chinese padded over
coats, which have been bought in large
quantities.
Many Chinese families are leaving
Mukden. The Chinese are extensively
counterfeiting Russian money.
Chinese have brought into Mukden
ten soldiers who. it was believed, had
b-en killed or captured at Liaoyang.
They had been rescued and cared for
by natives, who fed them and brought
them to the Russian lines. The Chinese
refused payment from the men, but
they were suitably rewarded by the
officers of the regiment.
The Russians have taken many
Chunchuches prisoners, among them
being found a number of Chinese reg
ular soldiers.
MUKDEN. Sept. 22.â -The situation
here continues quiet. Small parties of
Japanese skirmishers are pushing
northward, on the road from Bentsia
putse to Fushan.
It is said by Russian spies that Mar
quis Oyama. has detached a consider
able force to co-operate with his army
before Port Arthur.
Bennett Burleigh wires from Tokio to
the Daily Telegraph, denying that the
Russians destroyed the railway bridge
at Liaoyang. He says that only the
woodwork was burned and that the
steel girders are intact. He adds that
the Russians hardly damaged the rail
way between Dalny and Liaoyang.
The Dally Telegraph's Tientsin cor
respondent reports bodies of Russian
cavalrymen at Fakoman, a rich district
across the Liao River, west of Tie Pass.
LONDON, Sept. 23.â Various uncon

that the Vladivostok cruisers have sail

captured a fort from the Japanese;
that Madame Stoessel was wounded in
the shoulder while attending wounded
soldiers at Port Arthur; that the Rus
sians are leaving Mukden, etc., but lit
tle reliable news has been received
here.
LONDON, Sept. 22,â At the banquet
of the Institute of International Law
this evening Lord Rosebery, toasting
the foreign delegates, dwelt upon the
importance of questions of interna
tional law. It was foolish, he said, to
ignore the fact that there was supposed
to be some rivalry between Great Brit
ain and Russia, but he was convinced
there was room in Asia for both pow
ers, and when that was recognized by
both it would be better for the world's
peace.

lows who are gathered together In
this city to attend the eighteenth an
nual session of, the order had a sur
prise sprung on them yesterday when
it was announced that owing to the
order's having held a session at Balti
more last year and to Washington's
proximity to that city the representa
tives from the national capital had
been Instructed to withdraw its ac
ceptance of the honor. Immediately
a representative from Philadelphia
was on his feet with the announce
ment that the Quaker City would wel
come the representatives next year.
This announcement was received with
applause and it was unanimously
agreed to hold the eighty-first session
in Philadelphia, beginning with the
second Monday of next September.
The selection of Philadelphia was
not made without some opposition on
the part of one Pennsylvania repre
sentative, who argued that- the con
vention should be held In a city that

No better exhibition of crack drilling
could have been given than that of
Washington, D. C, canton and Sacra
mento canton yesterday afternoon at
the Mechanics' Pavilion. The contest
is to decide the national championship
in class A. Patriarchs Militant drill
regulations. The cantons both did so
well that it was hard to determine
which of them is entitled to the prize,
but the impression seems to be that the
TWO CRACK DRILL CORPS.
Another amendment that caused a
fight was the' proposal to change the
constitution so as to admit the* wine
growers of California to membership in
the order. It stands now that no one
engaged In the liquor business shall be
eligible to membership. The amend
ment was not considered by the Grand
Lodge because it was not presented in
the, proper form. It is very likely that
this amendment will be proposed again
before the session adjourns. ; :":
As predicted in The Call of yesterday,
the big fight of the afternoon was the
proposaV by a representative from In
dian Territory to amend the constitu
tion so as to admit the half-breed In
dians, sons of early Odd Fellow settlers
in that part of the country. The repre
sentatives of Oklahoma and- Indian
Territory argued long and earnestly for
recognition for the white sons of In
dian mothers, but the amendment was
resolutely defeated, the Northern and
Eastern States voting solidly against
the proposition.
There were several minor events of
Interest that helped to vary the monot
ony of routine business. First was the
appropriation of $500 to the daughter of
a former past grand, sire of the: order
The next amendment to receive de
feat at the hands of the voting rep
resentatives was the proposition to al
low one representative from the Rebe
kah degree to be present at the annual
session of the Sovereign Grand Lodge.
This was ungallantly defeated by an
overwhelming majority and the sis
terhood must wait another year â¢ be
fore endeavoring to secure legislative
recognition in the sovereign body.
The first amendment that came up
for consideration was the changing of
the length pf a grand representative's
term. It was proposed to adopt a ro
tary system, so that the representative
could be elected each year instead of
every two years and thus enable him
to attend every session of the ordef.
After a hard fight it was defeated, the
Sovereign Grand Lodge deciding to
retain the old arrangement
The amendment to the constitution
to change the age eligibility from. 21
to 18 was defeated by a big majority.
A fight was expected on this question,
but when it cameHo voting the party
favoring the introduction of young
blood into the order waa found to be
a small minority.
had never before received the honor.
It was supposed that by this he meant
Buffalo, which is the only large city
that has never been visited by the an
nual session of the Sovereign Grand
Lodge of the Odd Fellows. There was
also some suggestion that Montreal
should be selected, as many of the
Grand Lodge wished to visit that city,
which has likewise never received a
convention of Odd Fellows.
One note of sadness was struck
yesterday morning when It was an
nounced that Grand Representative G.
R. Sumner of Massachusetts had died
at his home. Representative Sumner
had started for this city with the
Massachusetts party, but on the way
was stricken with apoplexy and re
turned to his home, where he lin
gered for a few days. The grand sec
retary was directed to send a tele
gram of sympathy to the bereaved
family.
The next important business before
the meeting was the submitting of
several amendments to the constitu
tion of the order. These were all in
the line of radical changes in the
policy of the Odd Fellows and all,
after much exciting discussion, met
with defeat.
Washington came on the floor to the
tune of the- Washington Post March,
and moved a little slow for the quick
step set by the band. The leader took
the hint and gave the signal for slower
time, but soon the canton from the
capital city had settled down to busi
ness and improved its step so as to
come within the regulation time.
Colonel Patterson, Major Brown and
Lieutenant Landers of the regular
army acted as judges and decided to
withhold their decision until to-night,
at which time the winning teams will be
announced and the prizes awarded.
"Washington met with one misfortune
early in the drill. In the movement
"rear three left front Into line, double
time." one of the Patriarchs slipped
and fell with considerable force, but he
About 5000 persons witnessed the
drills. Sacramento came on the floor
first, and by its perfect cadence of step
and well maintained distances won
much applause. In the manual of
swords the canton was not quite, so
proficient as Washington, but other
wise there was not much difference be
tween the competing teams.
Sacramento suffered a trifle in dress
ing less promptly than its opponent,
and lost some in the movements by
sixes.

gamely regained his position in line
and went through the difficult drill
without making another error. The
canton was particularly complimented
on the brisk manner in which It exe
cuted its movements. The ginger that
the men from the East put into their
work counted much with the judges.
In the evening there was a dress pa
rade, in which all of the cantons that
have attended the encampment took
part. The Rebekah drill corps of San
Francisco was also in line and was fre
quently applauded. Captain Allie Park
er's young ladies have certainly made
a study of "time and space" and know
how to apply it mechanically. After the
dress parade the young ladies gave an
exhibition drill, executing a number of
difficult orders, and were on the floor
for nearly three-quarters of an hour.
The usual tactics employed in the
ceremony of dress parade were exe
cuted by the cantons. The commands
were formed in a hollow oblong, and in
the center the commanding officers
were stationed, at the front and center
of the battalion, facing the grand
stand.
OFFICERS ARE ELECTED.
Officers for the ensuing year were
elected by the Grand Encampment of
California yesterday morning. In ac
cordance with the usual custom each
of the officers was advanced a step,
leaving but one. that of grand Junior
warden, to be filled.
As was expected, there was a spirit
ed contest for this honor, it being the
stepping-stone to higher offices. There
were seven candidates in the field, but
after the first ballot all but two
dropped out- The result of the first
ballot was as follows: Pierce, 78:
Wulff. 40; Chappelle, 40; Turpin. 26;
Colley, 19; Osthoff, 15; Wilson. 14.
Necessary to elect, 117. On the sec
ond ballot, all other candidates having
â¢withdrawn, Fred E. Pierce of Los An

accordingly declared elected. The of

The most important events of yester
day were the contests of cantons at
Mechanics' Pavilion and the conferring
of the grand decoration of chivalry
upon distinguished members of the
Order of Odd Fellows. Thousands of
visitors and residents witnessed these
events, which proved to be the most
pleasing of the encampment.
At the conclusion of the parade the
Sovereign Grand Lodge will again go
into session at Native Sons* Hall and
the Grand Encampment of California
will meet at the Odd Fellows' building.
A concert will be given at Mechanics'
Pavilion in the afternoon, and in the
evening the Patriarchs Militant will
hold a dress parade, after which prizes
will be awarded to the cantons that
contested for the same throughout the
week. The Jinal tunction of the encamp
ment will be a full-dress ball at the
Pavilion. This promises to be a bril
liant affair.
Rain or shine, the grand parado of the
Odd Fellows will start on its inarch
through the city at 10 o'clock this morn
ing. It was announced by the commit
tee last night that it would take a
pretty brisk September shower to J
dampen the ardor oi' those that have
made up their minds to join in the
pageant, but if the heavens began to
pour the rain down in sheets the grand
marshal would use his discretion and
disband the column.
If nature favors, San Francisco will
be treated to a view of the largest
fraternal parade ever held on the coast.
Twelve thousand paraders in fourteen
divisions have been provided for, and
they will form a line some miles in I
lonpth if the bombardment from the 'â¢
clouds does not drive them to cover.
At 10 o'cirek this morning the whistles
of factories and steam vessels will
pound a hoarse salute to the Odd Fel
luws as they start on their way through
the city's streets. Every one is hoping
that nature will permit the covering of
the route selected.
Pageant Will Be
Disbanded if
Necessary.
The first of the speakers was Miss
Rachel E. Mitchell. She was followed
by Mrs. Mabel Richardson Kromlller.
Miss Edna Hales and Miss Carrfe Inch.
Each of the befitting speeches received
loud applause from the audience. Then,
as the uniformed line knelt to be dec
orated, little Miss Harris advanced and
receiving each insignia from the gen
eral of the Patriarchs Militant nlnned
It on the breast of each kneellnsr man.
As each man was decorated there came
a round of applause from the crowded
Pavilion. A short prayer by the brigade
chaplain. Major George T. Shaw, ended
the ceremonies.
Those who received the grand decora
tion last night were:
G. A Vincent. "West Virginia: O. VT. Erte

hands of Miss Jessie Harris, the In
signia of tha grand decoration of chiv
alry-
While the long lines of the battalions
of Patriarchs Militant stood at atten
tion General Raney addressed the men
chosen for the highest decoration In the
order. He bade them advance to the
altar, which consisted of a large drum
placed in the center of the hall, on
which rested an open Bible. To this
altar the men advanced and were asked
If they were ready to assume the obli
gations that go with the acceptance of
the decoration. In full, round tones
came the answer In unison "I am." At
this the candidates for the honor were
directed to kneel In a circle around the
drum while they each repeated in uni
son the following vow:
Of my own rreo will ana accord In the
presence of these Uvins witnesses, I volun
tarily promise and pledge myself to defend
maidens, wives, widows and orphans In thÂ»tr
rights; to relieve distress, to permit no ex
tortion In so far as I am able to prevent tt.
and to administer Justice to the advancement
of honor and the suppression of vice. All of
which I, in this presence, do vow it is my
purpose and intention to perform under Â»
penalty which shall be.no less than a degra
dation or loss of my pvsonal and military
honor if I violate thla solemn obligation.
After repeating this vow the men
arose and formed In line across the Pa
vilion. Then occurred speeches of ad
vice, wisdom, encouragement and
warning, spoken by the young women
of the Rebekahs who participated in
the ceremonies when the members of
the Rebekah degree received the deco
ration.

Erric Scudder, son of the Rev. William
H. Scudder, pastor of the Park Congre
gational Church, skipped away from
home by the light of the moon last Sat

âat least not by any member of his
family. Accompanying v the youth in
his adventure ,is Eugene Kraft, a son
of well-to-do parents, who has been
Scudder's companion , since they first
began attending the high school to
gether. As they had $150 between them
when they started their parents be
lieve they are speeding toward the
World's Fair, because they have long
entertained romantic notions of what it
C Â°The 'first the Rev. Mr. Scudder knew
tfeat his boy was going away was when
he received a telephone message at 9
o'clock Saturday night from some one
in Oakland, saying that his son was
eoing for a trip and would not return
for several days. ' Before the preacher
could ask for his son's destination the
Informant quit the telephone. Mr
Scudder thinks It was Kraft who did
the telephoning. As the overland train
leaves Oakland at 9 o'clock Mr. Scud
der thinks also that the youths were
about to, take it for the East.

"Did not your husband give Hayne
a thrashing?" queried Attorney W. J.
Donovan.
There was no reply.
"Did your husband hit Hayne?" de
manded Justice W. R. Geary.
"Well, he did not kiss him, your
Honor," replied Mrs. Grug-gel.
Hayne, it appeared, had hurriedly
left the Gruggel home after his en
counter with the angry husband. *
"Case dismissed," ordered . Justice
Geary. "Let Hayne s*ue for his $35
if he wants to. There is no criminal
action in this case."
OAKLAND, Sept. 22. â Mrs. E.
Gruggel, residing at 157 Eighth street,
was discharged in the Police Court
after examination on the accusation
that she had embezzled $35 from
Thomas Hayne, formerly a roomer at
the Gruggel residence. Mrs. Gruggei
explained that Hayne had deposited
$60 with her, out of which she had
kept $35 as money due her for his
board and on a loan. There was not
any trouble, explained Mrs. Gruggel,
until one day Hayne tried, to make
love to his buxom landlady. Mr. Grug
gel appeared in evidence about that
time and there were ructions.
LANDLADY SAl'S ROOMER
TRIKD TO WOO HER
After Mlds McNab, who led the way, cam*
Miss Anita Oliver and Miss Marietta Havens
walking abreast. Miss Bertha Young, maid
of honor, walked alone. Tbe bridesmaids were
all gowned alike, in picture robes of pale blue
chiffon. A unique and graceful feature of the
bridesmaids', attire was the lets of pink or
white carnations carried loosely around the
shoulders and over each arm. Each wore the
bride's gift,, a necklace with pearl and tur
quoise pendants. J
, The simple ceremony, at which Dr. E. E.
Baker, pastor of the First PreÂ«byterlan Church,
officiated, took place in the drawing-room,
an apartment richly furnished In mauve satin
and gold. Great filmy bows of white tulle
held the feathery fronds of asparagus fern In
place over the front window. In which the
bridal party stood. Knots and ends of pale
blue ribbon, each knot holding a Bridesmaid
rose, dspended from the wreathing ferns, the
whole effect being exquisitely delicate. The
game arrangement of ferns, ribbons and buds
was followed In ornamenting the doorways and
mantels. In the rear drawing-room pink ribbon
being substituted for the blue. An orchestra
played the wedding match, and at the solemn
moment of betrothal a- chime of ellver bella
softly proclaimed the gi&d tidings.
Dr. McNab, who. by the way. Is a very
handsome man, was accompanied by his
brother, John B. McNab. as best man, the
â¢other gentlemen in the bridal party being Dr.
Alanson Weeks,. Dr. Benjamin Bakewell and
Russell Taylor.
The wedding of Miss Young and Dr. McNab
lias been awaited by the exclusive set with
much interest. The bride is the youngest
daughter of Alexander ' Young, the Honolulu
capitalist 'and owner of the beautiful new ho
tel there. Dr. McNab is Â¦ a graduate of the
medical department of the State University
and U a successful Â¦ young Los Angeles physi
cian. His father was the late J. D. McNab,
a wealthy and prominent resident of Riverside.
The happy couple will enjoy a short honey
moon at Del Mont* and will return to Rose
Crest for a visit with the bride's parents be
fore they leave for Honolulu, where they ex
pect to go next" month. Dr. and Mm. McNab
will reside In Los Angeles.
OAKLAND. Sept. 22.â The exquisite dainti
ness which has ever been characteristic of Miss
May Young furnished a keynote for the wed
ding picture at Roue Crest to-night, and never
did bride plight her troth In more fairy-like
environments than when she gave herself to
Dr. Thomas Reid McNab. Feathery ferns,
palely blushing buds and ribbons of y tender
blue misglad their exquisite pastel tones with
the life and movement of a brilliant amj fash
ionable throng. Then 'When the bridal party
in stately procession descended the wide stairs
it seemed as If the figures in some*exq'ulsite old
painting had suddenly come to life, euch magic
may a golden cupid work.
Â¦First the ribbon-bearers. Dr. Bakewell and
Dr. Weeks, prepared the way and with broad
satin bands formed an aisle through which the
blue-gowned attendants passed, preceding the
bride, a petite vision of loveliness In a picture
gown of soft, cream-colored messallne. The
rich, satiny folds swept back In a very long
train, draped with rose- point lace and clusters
of lilies of the valley.. The veil, which almost
enveloped the bride, was edged with rare lace
and caught up, coronet-like,- with a half
wreath of lilies of the valley. In one arm the
bride carried a great shower of the same deli
cate flowers.

BRIEF CITY NEWS.
Smith home, where he had formerly re
sided. Jackson had confided the story
of his heart burden and the black hope-
Ieisness of the future that the card3
had unfolded. Jackson had of'cen reaÂ£
the cards for his friends. They thought
it was merely pastime. To him it was
all too serious.
He Taelieved so firmly the warnings
that he conveyed them to his intimate
friend Havens, the bridegroom. To him
Jackson wrote, and th'e note was found
among his effects, as follows:
Girard â Whatever you do. don't fall to see
me to-r.ljrht. it iÂ» to decide whether you are
to be nappy or not for life. I can fix It for
you.
That summons Havens did not re
ceive. It is supposed Jackson had a
message to deliver which he thought
would bear upon the future of his
friend.
Evidence was found, also, of Jack
son's state of mind In another note he
had written, evidently not long before
he took poison. It reads as follows:
From F. W. Jackson :
This life is but a life of trouble of sorrow,
joy and disappointing. So to this world I say
goodby, and In the world above we all may
meet again. May God forgive me for this
awful crime and may he bless the little girl.
I lovÂ«.
That Jackson should have Leen so
ardently in love with Mrs. Knuth is
considered almost unexplainable by his
friends. The "little "irl," as he affec
tionately proclaims her. is . possessed
of no physical charms. She is a hunch
back and dwarfed. Despite this the
man, by every word and ,action, evi
denced his wild desire to win the
woman. In failure he sought surcease
in death.
Two months agro Knuth and his
wife quarreled and the husband left.
About that time Jackson tried to com
mit suicide by drinking carbolic acid.
Despondency over the woman was
given as the cause.
Jackson was 27 years old, a native of
Canada. He had served in the Phil
ippines In the United States army.
An autopsy confirmed the supposi
tion that Jackson had taken strych
nine, and the Coroner's Jury to-night
rendered a verdict of suicide by
strychnine poisoning.

Jackson departed and within a half
hour had taken the fatal drug at a
place hardly a block distant from the
Smith house.
Linked with Jackson's disappoint
ment of the heart Is the story of his
appeal to the mysteries of the cards
for a solution of his troubles. Jackson
was a devotee of the mystic art. He
believed in fortune tellers' revelations.
He professed to know the hidden se
crets that were veiled to ordinary mor
tals. And to these uncanny oracles
he had conceived, in a seething tur
moil of mental stress the melancholy
lover hearkened.
All this was disclosed to-day by
Frank Ryan, a deputy constable, with
whom Jackson had of late lived at
S64 Washington street, after he left* the
OAKLAND, Sept. 22.â Under the spell
of a morbid infatuation for . a woman
who was the wife of another man, and
believing that fate had doomed him
never to win the object of his love,
Frederick W. â¢ Jackson, a perfumery
salesman, committed suicide at 10:30
o'clock this morning by taking strych
nine at the corner of Alice and Sec
ond streets. Jackson walked a block
after he took the poison before he suc
cumbed. He was hurried to the Re
ceiving Hospital, but died while in the
physician's hands. * Â¦Â¦
Last night the despondent man was
attendant upon Girard Havens at \ his.
wedding to Julia Smith, sister to Mrs.
Anie Knuth, the woman with whom
Jackson - was in love. The marriage
was celebrated at the Smith home, 654
Jackson street. During the festivities
Jackson tried to kiss Mrs. Knuth.
She repelled him. This morning he
returned to the house and again at
tempted to embrace the woman. Again
she repulsed the strangely persistent
admirer.
Temporary provision for earning

Colonel Waite has been ailing since

aged to keep at his work in the face

he collapsed entirely. As his illness is
likely to extend over a.' long time, his

mulgated announcing his relief from
the command. A copy of these or

"I am an old woman and a Rous
seau," writes the Beaumont corre
spondent- -Many years ago I had a
brother who went to California. He
must be the man who is dead and has
the great fortune."
But Madame Brechin fails to tell the
police anything that will help them to
find the supposed millionaire. Accord
ing to the information that is in her
possession, the Indiana claimant is
one of three nephews to whom by will
Â¦was devised the estate. But there
was a second will, so the tale runs, by
which these blood relations^were dis
inherited and the fortune given to
.strangers. It was said that Nephew
Rcusseau had devoted $5000 to the la
bor of establishing his claims to a
third of the millions.
In the town of Beaumont, Tex., re

The real estate committee also made
out a table showing' the comparative
valus of the land and quoting instances
where other lots in the vicinity had in
creased . in value with great rapid
ity. According to the report of the
committee, the land will be steadily in
creasing in value, and if the city does
not acquire It soon it will be selling at
a much advanced. figure in a short time.
Accordlng~to McLaren, the chaparral
growth which covers a portion of the
ground adds much to the beauty of the
plade. He stated that this brush would
make an ideal decoration and a novel
effect in horticulture. He commented
favorably upon-the location of the pro
posed park, and paid special attention
to its charming views.
. The real, estate committee made a
lengthy and^ elaborate report, praising
the location and urging the city to
make the purchase without further
delay. Special stress was laid on the
running stream which courses through
the land, the quality of Its soil and its
roadways. This committee, also re
ported that the car service was good
at the present time, and when a pro
posed new line is complete "it would be
within easy access to the^center of the
city. .
John ' McLaren, superintendent of
Golden Gate Park, was the special
guest of the citizens, and his opinion of
the park is a favorable one. Mr. Mc-
Laren was much impressed with the
location of the site and its natural
beauties. He could find no fault with
any particular spot and suggested that
Oakland was fortunate in having such
a site to choose from.
The* citizens' committee,' in its long
report, had nothing but praise for the
tract of land and suggested that the
city lose no time in acquiring it as a
site for an Ideal park. . As to the price
asked, the committee expressed its
opinion that $1000 per acre was a fair
figure to set. upon such land.-
The committee told of the beautiful
location and the natural advantages
enjoyed by the proposed site and sug
gested that all citizens and voters make
a personal Inspection of the place. The
committee was made up as follows:
John rule, J. Tyrrel, Hugh Hogan,
J. C. McMullen, E. R, Tait, E. P.
Vandercook, John T. Bell, William J.
Laymance, W. E. Gibson, W. H. Weil

son, C. F. Carl, Charles H. Taylor, L. G.
Burpee, A. H. Schlueter, James Maclise,
F. C. Turner.
The ground of the site was thoroughly
explored by the Various committees and
other citizens interested in the pro
posed deal. To every one, the site
semed an ideal spot for a city park.
The real estate committee compared the
value of the land to that of other dis
tricts, and Quoted figures to show
where the valuation would increas*
abnormally within-a short time.
Several hundred representative citi
zens of Oakland visited the site. of the
proposed Central Park this morning
to make an Inspection of the tract
of land which the city proposes buying
and transforming into a ' public park.
Among the most notable figures in the
gathering was John McLaren, super
intendent of , Golden Gate Park. ' The
three committees, real estate, press and
citizens, made favorable reports and
urged that, the city-purchase the land
at the price named.-

Pardee, who spoke for the State, say
ing among other things:
A. Jonas, president of the Merchants*
Exchange, opened the programme by
presenting United States Senator
George C. Perkins as chairman. of the
evening. President Jonas said the re
ception had been called by the Union
League of Oakland, the Merchants' Ex
change and the Oakland Board of
Trade, to enable the people of Oakland
to testify to their regard for Secretary
Metcalf and their appreciation of his
appointment to one of the most impor
tant bureaus in the national Govern
ment. In his address President Jonas
said it was part of his duty as tempo
rary chairman to eulogize Secretary

out saying that the distinguished Oak
lander had won a splendid name for.
himself in the years that he had lived
in Oakland, . . . . , Â¦ â¢ . --Â¦- -
Senator Perkins said:
YIt is <juite unnecessary for me to
say that we, his neighbors, feel a Joy
over the selection of our friend Secre

ident's Cabinet. It is more than fitting
that we should to-night assemble here
to give voice to our feelings. Victor

worthy of it."

OAKLAND'S TRIBUTE.
The theater was crowded to its ca
pacity. There had been no restrictions
upon the attendance, it being- limited
only by the seating ability of the audi
torium and stage. Simple but appro
priate decorations, the national flag
predominating, embellished the inte
rior.
. Absolutely non-partisan was the af
fair. Politics had no part. It was a
genuine and sincere mark of civic pride
and personal congratulation, divested
of every element of partisanship.
Victor H. Metcalf, Secretary of Com
merce and Labor, was the guest of
Oakland to-night at a splendid public
demonstration held in the Macdonough
Theater. The affair was a reception to
the distinguished Oaklander on the eve
of his return to the national capital.
Oakland, the home city of Sacretary
Metcalf. gave expression to the appre
ciation its citizens felt over Mr. Met
calf's appointment as a member of
President Roosevelt's Cabinet, and tes
tified to the high esteem in which the
new Secretary is held by those among
whom he has spent many years of an
active career. The assemblage was one
to be given high place in the record of
representative gatherings. LYom all the
walks of life men were there. Most ap
propriately. United States Senator
George C. Perkins and Governor George
C. Pardee, both Oaklanders, had special
places on the elaborate reception pro
gramme. :
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,

And \vh6n I shall Save finished my work I

cordial greeting I feel the debt of gratitude I
owe to my home town, to the citizens of So
lano, of Centra Costs and of the counties of
the 'old Third Congressional District. I ap
preciate It all. It has been an embarrassment
for me to sit here And listen to the high
praise that has been given me.
But I want to sir" a few words about Oak
land and the maKnlfV-ent county in which we
live. To You men of i the Board of Trado-and
the Merchants' Exchange much praise is due
for the wcrk you.- have ' done. A sew era is
dawning in Onkland, an era of great promise
for the future. . Keep on with the -good work.

Let the improvement of "Lake Merrltt be no
longer a dream, but a reality. You can' leave
the development of y >ur water front Â«afely in
the hunda of your j distinguished chairman.
Senator Perkins.
As Secretary Metcalf was introduced
the audience gave him a rising welcome
with cheers. In replying to the speeches
of the evening. Secretary Metcalf said:
Wben a State can enjoy the distinction of
having representation in each of the three
branches of the Government it Is a mighty
distinction. California did at one time enjoy
euch a distinction, having had Justice Field
in the Supreme Court of the United States,
Joseph McKenna as Attorney General and our
representatives In Congress.
METCALF REPLIES.
Colonel John P. Irish was introduced
as a friend of Oakland. During his
speech Colonel Irish traced the compo
sition of the three co-ordinate branches
of the Federal Government, and added:
declared the eyes of the civilized world
were upon Manchuria and that sooner
or later the Government would be com
pelled to take up the question of the
"yellow peril."
"It seems proper," declared Petry, "to
call attention to this subject. It seems
proper to call attention to the fact that
the greater part of our commerce be
tween this coast and the Orient is in
the hands of the Chinese. . But we be
lieve that the great work- of the De
partment of Commerce - and Labor is
safe in the hands of Oakland's first
citizen, Victor H. Metcalf." Â» :
Mayor "Warren Olneyv speaking for
the city of Oakland, said:
"I know I voice your sentiments
when I say Oakland rejoices that one
of her favorite sons has been called to
the national capital. A great honor has
been conferred upon California and
upon us in the selection of our fellow
citizen. Oakland is on the map of the
United States and has been there for
many years."
The Rev. Charles R. Brown, pastor
of the First Congregational Church,
added his congratulations and, too,
joined in the family rejoicing.
Robert M.. Fitzgerald, impliedly se
lected to represent the minority party,
of Alameda County as well as to speak
as a personal friend of Secretary Met
calf, gave one of the wittiest addresses
of the evening. His humor was not
without a vein of seriousness and he
gave heartfelt expression- to his con
gratulation.
Superior Judge John Ellrworth said
the gathering was. not a partisan one,
but was simply that of citizens, friends
and neighbors of Secretary Metcalf, as.
sembled to show respect for the man
and to express approval of President
Roosevelt's act in making the appoint
ment.
A. A. Moore spoke feelingly as the
representative of the bar of Oakland
and of Alameda County.

Investisatins a Death.
Coroner Leland has ordered an in
vestigation into the death of Mrs.
Mary Acmes Schweitzer, a married
Â¦woman 24 years old. who lived at
1613 Clay street. Dr. Frisbie. who
had been in attendance for ten days
and i:? to the time of death at S
o'clock last Wednesday morning, ex
plained that he had refused to sign
the death certiScate because he did
not believe that the disease for which
he was treating her caused death and
because the relatives of the woman
would not permit him to perform an
autopsy. Detective Coleman and
Deputy Coroner Brown investigated
the death last night and believe that
death was due to natural causes. Dr.
Bacip-alupi sent the stomach to the
City Chemist. '
The rain is not needed in the agri
cultural districts at this time, and may
do a great amount of damage. Willson
sent out storm warnings all along the
line and gave the farmers an opportu
nity to prepare for trouble from the
elements. Those who took advantage
of the monitions will probably be able
to save their fruit.
The outlook for to-day is for heavy
showers in all the region west of the
Rockies between Canada and Mexico.
The storm came sweeping in from the
Pacific Wednesday. The State of Wash
ington was the first point of attack.
Hour by hour the clouds became black
er and heavier with rain. An area of
high pressure extending from the
Rockies to the Atlantic stopped the
eastern coursa of the storm and drove
it south. That is why California is get
ting the rain that really belongs to the
valleys of the Missouri and Mississippi.
From San Diego to Vancouver the skies
were moist and menacing 'last night,
and unless all signs fail the precipita
tion, to-day will be heavy.
The storm, according to local Fore
cast Official Willson. is out of season.
The fall rains are usually light and of
small area. Those of winter are heavier
and more extensive. The present dis
turbance belongs to the latter class by
reason of its severity and its length.
How long it will last is uncertain, for
so far It has shown no diminution of
strength.
Little wind accompanied the storm.
On Third street, between The Call and
Examkier buildings, the rain swept
along with great vigor, and for a time
in that vicinity every one who ventured
out received a free bath.
The weather clerk disclaims all re
sponsibility for the storm which struck
San Francisco yesterday. He had done
his best, he asserts, to give the visiting
Odd Fellows a fine sample of Califor
nia's climate, but Jupiter Pluvius took
an unfair advantage of him.
About 11 o'clock last night the rain
fall, which had begun earlier in the
evening, increased in force, and from
midnight until 1 o'clock a. m. and later
the water poured down from the heav
ens in torrents. Shortly after midnight
a torrent swept' down Market street
past the Palace Hotel like a millrace.

"We, the jury, find the defendant
guilty of murder in the first degree,"
read the foreman. Fallon's face formed
into a brutal, unconcerned smile. He
ti'ol-c the verdict calmly and made the
*-taun;ent quoted above to one of the
deputy sheriffs.
Judge Ferral, Assistant District At
torney, who ably prosecuted the case
against Fallon, said that the jury's ver
dict was the quickest work that he had
ever seen done by jurors in a murder
trial.
The crime for which Fallon will pay
the death penalty was the murder of
his wife on April 1. Agnes Fallon
?tood alone in the kitchen of her little
home in the Mission, unmindful of her
impending fate, when her enraged hus
band strode in, foully shot her and then
surrendered himself to the police. The
murder was the result of jealousy. FalÂ«
kn and his wife had been on unfriendly
â¢errns for months prior to the murder.
The husband accused the woman of
having been untrue to him, and men
tioned the name of one Thomas Flem
ing as the cause of their unfriendliness.
Mrs. Fallon was fatally shot and died
-he same day. It was on this day that
Frederick Tobleman. recently convicted
of murder in the first degree in Judge
Dunne's court, shot and killed his wife.
Fallon will be sentenced Saturday
morning, October 1.
"The tray of the transgressor Is hard,
but I'm big and ugly enough, so I guess
I'll have to stand it." Such was the
statement made by Thomas P. Fallon,
â¢wife murderer, who was found guilty
last night in the court of Judge Lawlor
of murder in the first degree. The ren
dering of the verdict was the Quickest
work ever done by a jury in a murder
case in this city. The jurors were out
just twenty minutes when they arrived
at the conclusion that Fallon should
hang by the neck until he was as dead
as the r>oor woman who was once his
wife.

EHA.TTLE. Sept. 22. â Seattle made
it three straight to-day from Portland.
William* was in form and held the
Webfooters down to three hits and
no runs. Skel Roach pitched almost
as good a came as Williams, but two
error* in the first inning-, one of which
was mad<Â» by Roach himself, gave
Seattle the lead and Portland could
not get into the running. Parke Wil
son was pat oat of the game for
kicking and Blankenship caught the
last fonr innings. Delehanty surprised
everybody by playing a brilliant third
base. The only tim- Portland had a
chance to break up things Delehanty
made a brilliant stop and quick
throw. Tte score:

before the turn was reached.
Half-way around the lower turn
O'Neill sent Africander up next the
rail, and the speed shown by this horse
tv as astounding to these who thought
Le was no longer fit to compete with
first-class racers. He steadily improved
his position, while at the same time
Dainty, on the outside, was also gain
ing on the pacemaker, Dolly Spanker.
In the stretch Dainty was the only one
able to overhaul the leader, and the
finish was between the pair, with
Dainty winning by a neck. Dolly Spank
er was second, while the closing up of
the rear division resulted in Africander
running third. Proper, which really ran

Hans TVagner, with R. up. was

than a real contest. It was marred by
Thane falling at the stretch turn and
injuring J. J. McCaSerty, his rider.
"Boots" Durnell simply outrode the
others and purposely drew the finish
down to -a neck. He dodged all the

United States Local Inspectors O. F.
Bolles and John K. Bulger yesterday
suspended for four months the license
of Captain T. V. Hogan, master of the
steamer Maggie, for grounding on the
beach a short distance south of Point
Lobos on September 4. The verdict
is as follows:
"After a careful consideration of
the evidence in this case we find that
Captain T. V. Hogan was unskillful
and negligent in navigating the steam
er Maggie on September 4, 1904, in
running alortg the land so close in a
thick fog and in not taking sound
ings, as he should have done, i Had
ho done so it would have shown him
that the vessel was too near the shore.
For such unskillfulness and negli
gence we' Suspend his license as mas
ter and pilot for four months." '

. Responsibilities for Four Months

Disasters in the North.
Miss Annie Smith told of her life in
the Kornfeld family and said that she
was always treated as a daughter. She
attended to the household duties, even
doing the washing, at the same time
she was attending school. The wit
ness said she had seen Kornfeld re
turn a letter from his brother unopen
ed. The trial of the case will be re
sumed on Monday.
The opening statement of Otto Irv
ing Wise to the jury in the Kornfeld
will contest yesterday morning devel
oped a romantic life story of a young
Russian Jew who left Warsaw, Russia,
to find fortune in other lands. As at
torney for Joseph Guzix, the nephew
who is contesting the will, Wise said
that Kornfeld was born near Warsaw
and his name was Abe Guzik.
Abe" Guzik was a watchmaker's ap
prentice. With him worked a German
named Charles Kornfeld, who had
served his apprenticeship. The German
died and Abe Guzik, to evade military
service and . to go where his career
would not be hampered by the oppres
sion meted out to the Jews, left Russia
and took the German's name and trade.
The attorney said that Guzik alias
Kornfeld left two brothers and two sis
ters In Russia. One of the brothers and
the sisters are now dead. The other
brother, Fibusz Guzik, came to Amer
ica twice, but i3 now in Warsaw, over
eighty years old.
A brother of Joseph Guzik, Philip,
came to San Francisco, and with Korn
feld's assistance engaged in the cigar
business. He changed his name to
Button, which is English, for Guzik.
The young man committed suicide and.
said Wise, Kornfeld took possession of
his small estate, explaining that his
Russian relatives would be taken care
of in his (Kornfeld's) will. The attor
ney declared that he expected to prove
that Kornfeld wrote hundreds of af
fectionate letters to his relatives and
expressed promises of providing for
them. He argued that if the will is
broken the widow will not suffer be
cause she will receive half of the 5240,
000 estate, while the bequests to Miss
Smith, Reuben Lloyd and others will
go to the heirs at law..
Virginia Kornfeld, the widow, was
examined and said that she married
Kornfeld at Santa Clara in 1871. She
did not know where he was born nor
that he had another name. She had
heard of the Guziks in Russia, but only
saw Fibusz once when he was here,
her husband Baying that he had come
to get money and that he (Kornfeld)
did not want him around. Mrs. Korn
feld said that her niece, Annie Smith,
bad lived in the* family for 29 years.
H. Rlnaldo, a friend of Kornfeld,
said that he had written many letters
for the old man to his Russian rela
tives and had often heard Kornfeld
say that he intended to remember them
in his will.
Horn then gave the name of H. Do
lan, 200 Fell street, as. a saloon-keeper
who was "mprally intimidated."
"Did Dolan tell you I forced him to
buy cigars from me?" queried Com
missioner Drinkhouse.
"He 'told me that he had refused to
give orders to your, salesman, with the
result that a policeman was detailed
to watch bis place. A boy was caught
buying beer and Dolan was before the
Police Commission. He did not loae
his license, but since that time I have
sold him only one order, Commissioner
Drinkhouse's salesmen having gained
the business."
James H. Thrane, cigar manufactur
er at 1012 Seventh street, testified that
several saloon-keepers told him they
bought cigars from Drinkhouse because
they deemed it good business policy to
patronize him, inasmuch as he was a
member of the Police Board.
David Eichorn of 107 Fifth street, ci
gar manufacturer, could not tell of
any instances where Drinkhouse had
used intimidation to sell his cigars, but
a number of saloon-keepers had said.
"We've got to handle Drinkhouse's
goods." Â¦ .:?-'â¢ -'.Â¦;
E. J. Hurley, formerly a manufac
turer but now a journeyman, said that
he believed he was driven out of busi
ness because of the unequal competi
tion of Commissioner Drinkhouse.
Albert Johnson, manufacturer, em
ploying two men, was never told by
saloon-keepers that they were Intimi
dated by Drinkhouse, but they said
they were "under obligations to him."
The witness was not able to explain
anything further as to the "obliga
tiftns." v .
The saloon-keepers whose names were
given by the witnesses were subpenaed
last evening to appear at the investiga
tion this morning.
The Mayor announced that he could
attach no importance to hearsay testi
mony, but he decided to go on to give
the union the opportunity of a thor
ough presentation of its complaint.
Horn resumed, and t then gave the
name of Ludwig Busse of Howard
street "as one of the saloon men who.
told him he "had to handle" Drink
house's cigars. Busse's liquor license
was revoked several weeks ago by the
Police Commission because he was
found guilty of selling liquor to minors>
but It was subsequently renewed.
"After the renewal of the license,"
Horn testified, "Busse handled nothing
but Drinkhouse cigars. Before that
time he had' none on his shelves. He
told me he. had to sell them."
W. J. H. Mohler of Eleventh and
Mission streets had also told the wit
ness he deemed it wise to patronize the
Police Commissioner.
The first witness yesterday was Ed
ward Horn, cigar manufacturer at
615V- Grove street. He was asked to
proceed with his statement, and he de
clared that many saloon-keepers had
told him they couldn't buy cigars from
him because.they had to handle Drink
house's cigars.
"What ' saloon-keepers?" demanded
the Mayor.
"I can't give their names, because it
would injure my business," answered
the witness.
The Cigar-makers' Union failed to
make good its charges that Police '
Commissioner John A. Drinkhouse uses j
intimidation to Induce saloon-keepers'
to buy the non-union cigars for which '
he holds the agency, in, this city. The â¢
only evidence that the complainants [
could offer on this point at the hearing !
conducted by Mayor Schmitz yesterday
was hearsay, and that was not accept- !
able by him. i
Nick Blum admitted that he could !
not establish his allegations as to in- ;
timidation, his explanation being that
it was - impossible to get witnesses to
come forward because their business or
other interests would be jeopardized.
His case resolved itself intoÂ»an appeal
to the Mayor to help the local cigar- '
makers, by the removal of Drinkhouse
or otherwise, for they were being
thrown out of employment as a result
of the Commissioner's success in sell-
Ing goods manufactured in the East.
The spokesman for the union declared j
that notwithstanding proof of wrongful
Intimidation was lacking, it was plain â¢
to any person that the "moral intimi- j
dation" the Commissioner exerts over
the saloons "by virtue of his office." has
enabled him to corral the cigar business
of the town, and that he is therefore
responsible for the depression under .
which the cigar workers are laboring in ,
San Francisco. To this, the Mayor re
plied that it was undoubtedly true that j
Drinkhouse's business had been advan- Â¦
taged because of his public station, but
it was not clear how the situation could ;
be remedied. He did not believe that,
the Commissioner should be removed :
from office because he had thus been ,
benefited.
Says She Knew Nothing of

Saloon Men to Favor Him
After two years* absence from this
harbor the 'well-known freight steamer
Tunpico came into port yesterday
iron: Tacoma. She Is owned by the

in 1900 and her voyage down the Mau
jnee River into Lake Erie, thence to
Lake Ontario, the St. Lawrence and
.the Atlantic and around into the Pa
< Iflc was a journey of many hundreds
cÂ«f marine leagues. Since leaving this
locality she has been plying between

The eteamer brings to this port a cargo
of 2173 tons cf wheat and 40 tons of

f A SCHOOL-LH. P. and H. H., City.
There Is no public school on the Far

with Miss Daisy 'Dowd as teacher.
SOME MERRIMENT IS HERE FOR THOSE THAT SEEK IT.
PRESIDENTâ J. S., City. Rutherford
B. Hayes, who visited San Francisco
in September, 18S0, was the first Presi
dent who while filling the Presidential
chair visited the State of California.
BOARDING SCHOOLSâ C O. C,
City. If you will look in tho classified
part of the city directory you will find
a list of boarding schools. This depart*
ment does not advertise such.
THE commercial bodies of this city were the hosts at the ban
quet given to Secretary Metcalf as an enthusiastic expression of
California's gratification upon being represented in the Cabinet.
This feeling was especially appealed to by the fact that the Presi
ident for the position of greatest interest to California chose a Califor
nian, long tried in the public service and proved in his dignity, char
acter and statesmanship to be strong and worthy.
The appointment of Mr. Metcalf and the gratification it has
caused will have a distinctly useful effect upon public life and service
in this State. We now have representatives in each of the three co
ordinate branches of the national Government. We have in Justice
McKenna a citizen on the Supreme bench; our Senators and Repre
sentatives stand for us in the legislative branch of the Government,
and Secretary Metcalf represents us in the executive branch. Not
many States enjoy this distinction. We share it with Massachusetts
and Ohio. That is a class in which California may stand with pride,
that is enhanced by the fact that our representative in the executive
branch is worthy to stand with John Hay, Attorney General Moody
and Secretary of War Taft.

But soon the long, small waist came
to its own again, and extreme delicacy
was a more popular fad than ever be

"Say!" says Pen. "Say that you

trim waist of early youth.
Perhaps~"lt is a sign of the times
that thera was observed recently at a
fashionable summer hotel a young man
whose elegantly . attired figure dis
played; a waist as slim as a girl's. His

with the waist of^the Venus of
Milo is to be jjared down into the
sylph-like, wasp-waisted creature
which fashion now demands it is hard
to tell; but one thing is certain, that
there is an intimate relation between
the- waist line and the appetite, says
the New York Sun.
Before the era of large waists It
was held that a maiden should ap
pear to live on the smallest amount of
food and drink that would sustain life
and that she should display | such a
dainty capriciousness about this trifle
as to suggest a fairy sipping dew from
the flower cups. Eagerness for food
was considered indecorous.for she was
presumed to be a creature of so much
delicacy that the needs of the inner
woman were the very last thing she
thought of.
Indeed, at the slightest mental dis
turbance she usually refused to eat al
together, and never remembered the
lack of food until she* swooned away
from hunger. This was all extremely
interesting, but when big, strapping
girls became the fashion it was neces
sary to pack away in lavender the no
tion of a genteelly delicate appetite.
The young athletes were obliged to
have fuel for their vigorous frames,
and it soon became^ quite permissible
for a fashionably mannish girl with a
straight-front figure to take a yuly
masculine Interest In her food. Now
adays she Is frankly hungry and eats
straight through a meal of any num
ber of ' courses with much enojyment
and with no great amount of conven
tionality as to table manners.
But if fashion .demands waists re-
A N instance of much needed charity being denied a petitioner
Z\ for entrance at the City and County Hospital through lack of
Â¦* *- accommodations at that institution recently made manifest the
crying need for added appropriations devoted to the exigencies of
the city's asylum for the sick. Beds are not altogether lacking at the
institution, but the funds for the support of more patients than are
now installed therein are lacking and the hospital doors are therefore
closed perforce.
The last appropriation for the City and County Hospital in the
budget of the Board of Supervisors fixed the sum allotted to that
charity at $120,000. This was made to include everything â salaries
of the officers and attendants, the expenses of the nurses' training
school and the maintenance of the patients. With every item save
the last deducted from the general appropriation, there remains $76,
500 â the annual allowance for the actual care of the sick inmates.
With the recent decision of the Board of Health to the effect that a
minimum of 34 cents a day must cover the cost of each inmate's
support, the number of patients which the hospital can care for at one
time is 425. There is room, for more, but the money for their nTain
tenance is lacking.
The city has voted bonds for the building of a million-dollar
hospital which shall have equipment and appropriations commen
surate with its magnitude. But it will be several years before the
new hospital is open and ready to receive patients. In the mean
time the city's sick are clamoring for attention and there should
be no diminution of ihe efforts to alleviate their sufferings in an
ticipation of what will be done under the regime of the new insti
tution. ;-Â»":'â¢

In seventeenth century English cour
tesy maxims have. not quite so stately
a tone, and a spade, is frankly called
a spade in the following extract from
"The Accomplished Lady's Rich Closet
of Rarities or Ingenious Gentlewom

"A gentlewoman being at table abroad
or at home must observe to keep her
body straight and lean not by any
means with her elbows, nor by raven
ous gesture discover a voracious ap
petite. Talk not when you have meat
In your mouth and do not smack like
a pig, nor venture to eat spoonmeat

Which is as unseemly as the gentle
woman who pretended to have as little
a stomach as she had a mouth and
therefore would not swollow her peas
by spoonfuls, but took them one by one.
and cut them into two before she would
eat them. It is very uncommon to drink
so large a draft that your breath is al
most gone, and are forced to blow
strongly to recover, yourself; throwing
down your liquor as into a funnel Is
an action fitter for a Juggler than a
gentlewoman."
Codrington, in his book on "Instruct

Borders at Schools," suggests that "the
best refection that young gentlewomen
can take in the morning is the Pana

pound is composed of crackers and
water with a little sugar, and givts
them warnings against "fat meat." Yet
he is so far from Insinuating that the
"maids and ; borders" are greedy that
he kindly admits that they are "for
the most part not subject to the least
excess, unless it be of the sugar plum
or the macaroon, and for this they, are
too often punished by. the discomplex

FASHION NOW DEMANDS SLIM WAISTS AND THE GIRLS
MUST WITH VIGILANCE SUPPRESS THEIR APPETITES
npHE city of San Francisco is entitled to a strong and influential
representation in Congress. This city has much at stake in
1 being in the right attitude to the Federal Government. Every
session of Congress our commercial bodies are asking for attention
to some of our many interests, and these petitions and, other evi
dences express belief in our need of friendly treatment in national
legislation. We practically have two Representatives in the House.
They should be men who know and sympathize with all the needs of
all the people of this city, and they should, by the proper arts of
association and contact, be capable of making friends on the floor
in all parties, to the end that their efforts for their constituents may
find allies and assistance.
It is with no desire whatever to promote any partisan interest
that we declare that in the present Congress San Francisco has no
representative at all. It is true that two members, were sent to the
House, bnt the seats might as well have been left vacant. The blame
lies with the people whose votes elected the men who proved to be
jacking in adaptation to the office they sought.
Such a situation is very serious, and such an experience is un
pleasant. The other commercial centers of the country are well rep
resented in the House, by men who are helpful to others and de
serving the reciprocal help which they receive. They not all
members of some party, but they are representatives of all the in
terests which arc of importance to their constituents and are equally
at the service of all. .The result is that the other commercial cities
of the country get proper attention to their wants. San Francisco,
unhappily, gets no attention at all. Measures needed by this city
and passed by the Senate fail in the House by the indifference of our
two Representatives, or by their direct opposition.
Mr. Livernash was brought into politics by the nomination of
the Union Labor party two years ago, subsequently receiving the
Democratic* nomination. Now the order is reversed and he has the
tandem nomination again. He came into politics as the representa
tive of a class. This he avows in his letter accepting the Union
Labor party nomination, and he frankly declares that his status will
be unchanged in the next Congress.
We desire that the people shall note this situation. The Repub
lican and Democratic parties stand in opposition, but each is com
posed of individuals who represent all of the varied interests of the
community. In each party are workingmen, financiers, manufac
turers, merchants, mechanics, lawyers, doctors and preachers. When
a representative of either party is elected to Congress he represents
the whole community and not a self-isolated class. Mr. Livernash, in
his letter of acceptance, says that he goes to Congress "commissioned
to speak for organized labor" alone. He represents not alflabor, but
a certain class of labor, and makes it plain that he will owe allegiance
to nothing else.
This is class representation" solely. He feels no sense of alle
giance to any other part of his constituency nor to any other interest
of San Francisco, great or small. He is an esoteric representative,
with a restricted allegiance from which the public is excluded. He
does not allege, nor do his supporters, that a candidate representing
the whole community would not be as attentive to the petitions of or
ganized labor as to the requests of merchants, bankers, manufac
turers or unorganized labor. But he expressly declares that he will
represent only one class and its interests, and no other part of the
community at all.
This puts upon all other interests in the city the need of com
bining to secure the election of a representative of all, excluding
none, but standing for organized labor as well as for every other in
terest and activity which is part of the energy of this great city.
Popular government and class representation cannot exist long to
gether.
CLASS REPRESENTATIVES.
"Why Is It women are so stupid In
street cars?" asked a cross old bach
elor the other day. "They spread
their skirts over two seats, refuse to
move up and get mad if a man looks
at them, and madder if he doesn't."
Well, that will do for you, Mr.
Bachelor. But then what can you ex
pect from so misguided a creature?
He looks only for faults in women and
passes over the particularly stupid
things that men do in cars and other
places. He forgets that every night
of the world long suffering women
are climbed over and their feet trod
den upon by men who go out between
the acts at theaters; he forgets, too,
how often tired women stand ud for
miles in the cars, while some of these
weary bachelors sit still. How a man
can enjoy a seat in the car when a
woman stands beside him in the aisle
clutching the back of his seat and
trying hard to think that he Is a gen
tleman, but a very tired one, is be
yond the comprehension of the wom
an's department. If the bachelor
thinks that women are stupid In cars,
what does he think of some men In
cars? Those who will rise with alac
rity for a pretty girl and let a tired
washwoman with a bundle stand. If
he knew the withering contempt that
some of the girls feel for him it might
open his eyes.
Yes, women are stupid sometimes,
but then men cannot corner all the
stupidity in the world. A great many
men give women their seats, but many
do not; in fact, some women have
gone into business with such vigor
they are obliged to take their chances
with them in many other ways, which
is fair enough. But the bachelor
evinces a strange fatuousness if he
thinks that a woman cares if he
doesn't look at her. It would be Im
possible for him to believe that there
are women utterly indifferent whether
he looks at them or not. Bachelors
who are or consider themselves eligi
ble come to think that the entire fem
inine world is managed in relation to
them, while as a matter of fact there
Is a day now and then when they are
not thought of all day long. Funny,
isn't it, you cross old bachelor?
But to admit the stupidity of some
women in cars is not to agree with
this masculine grumbler by any
means. For one can see women evince
intelligence about seats almost every
day, and the writer not long ago saw
a young woman rise and give her seat
to a man! He was old and ill and he
thanked her very nicely and then, of
course, all the young men In the car
who had sat still when the man got
in wanted her to sit down. But she
thanked them and said she did not
mind standing at all.
Then the other day there was a
man who sat sidewise on the long seat
of a Selby car. taking up twice as
much room as If he had sat straight,
his head was buried In his paper and
what cared he how many tired wom
en stood? But finally a woman had
the courage to ask him to move up;
he grunted disagreeably and did so
crossly. I wonder If he could have
been the bachelor who uttered the
above plaint about stupid women. I
should not be the least bit surprised
If he was the very man. He is Just
the sort of creature who -would say
things like that and be occupying two
seats while he said it
The greatest fault to be found with
women is that they appear to have a
prejudice against moving up or down
as the case may be. You will see
three sit huddled together with a wide
open space just the other side of
them. But as a rule their behavior
in cars Is much more creditable than
that of men â so there. Mr. Bachelor!

On top of his money troubles the
suicide conceived a violent love for
Mrs. Mollet. She was not partial to his
affections and treated him distantly
whenever he proposed the making of
love in her presence. This seemed to
dwell heavily on Witham's mind and,
before putting an end to his existence,
he left a note to Mrs. Mollet stating
that as he was moneyless and despon
dent he had decided to die and there
fore she would be free to marry whom
she should choose. ,
Witham was also known as J. H.
Hall and was about 49 years eld. He
was a shrewd business man, but seem
ed to have been down on his luck late
ly. He tried to borrow money from his
landlady earlier in the day, but the
woman, refused to contribute. The body
was removed to the Morgue.
A combination of financial difficulties
and unrequited love for Mrs. Mollet
was the direct cause, of the man's 'rash
act. For some time he had conducted
a real estate brokerage business at 819
Market street, but a short while ago
the business failed and since then
Witham has known severe financial
strains.
J. H. Witham, a former real estate
broker, chose a sensational way of end
ing his earthly cares last night. He
walked leisurely into the drawing-room
of the residence of Mrs. Laura Mollet,
1322 Mission street, where he roomed,
and in the presence of the woman and
her two sons sent a bullet through his
brain, after first taking a drink of
whisky. - - .- â¢

Registrar's office. A subpena has been
issued for Registrar Adams to appear
with the records of appointment and
allotment at the next session, which
will be held on Thursday.
This is a new phase of the investi
gation of the election frauds and one
that the Grand Jury will take particu
larly into -its own hands. The prose
cution of stuffing at the polls will in
all probability be left altogether to the
Merchants' Association, for the Grand
Jury about arrived at the conclusion
yesterday that it. would be . inadvisable
for it t* '-take the matter up.
A subpena was also issued for Reg
istrar Adams to bring the rosters in
the several districts involved. The ros
ter, [already in the possession of the
Grand Jury is that of the Seventy
third Precinct, where Charles Wyman
is - said,' in , the. charge now. pending in
the Police Court, to have voted ille
gally. "But it is desired to have other
rosters- placed in safety deposit boxe3,
where they may . rest secure and be
avaHabte if heeded in - contemplated
prosecutions. . . - - ,
These records are to be held for the
use" of the Merchants* Association.
Foreman. Lilienfeld ignored a subpena
from the Democratic contest committee
to bring the roster of the Seventy-third
Precinct before it yesterday. He toqk
the position -that the committee was
without authority "to /compel him to
attend, and his objection to carting the
.records about the city - was that he
could take no risk in entrusting them
to the keeping, even temporarily, of
political or other committees that might
wish, to investigate. The foreman in
tended no reflection on the committee,
but he deemed it sufficient that the
Merchants' Association should conduct
the investigation of the alleged mis
conduct at the polls. The rosters and
other records will at all times be avail
able for the association and it is ad
visable that it shall have full control
and access of all the avenues of evi
dence.
BAKERSFIEL.D, Sept. 22.â John
Kemphill, a brakeman, left here last
right on an eastbound freight train.
Several Mexicans were seen to board
the train at Caliente. When near the
summit, about midnight. Hemphill was
missed. At daybreak his remains were
found by the side of the track by En
gineer McLennon of a Santa Fe over-
Lard passenger train. On the body,
which was Etiil warm, were eight deep
cuts and Etabs. Three knives, one cov
ered with blood, and a white hat were
found near by.
A Mexican on the train 6aw two men,
apparently Mexicans, one with a white
bar. Jump c2 at the plaÂ«e where the
body was found. Late this afternoon
the remains cf an unknown Mexican
were found a few yards from Hemp
hllTs body. Several deep wounds told
cf the brakeinan's desperate fight. The
body was covered with stones and loose
earth.
Sheriff Kelley and a posse are search
fr.gr the neighborhood.

Uon on the common stock. This would be
of equal benefit to Union Pacific, with the
expected distribution of Northern Securities,
which was used to lift the stock yesterday.
Am long as Union Pacific advances the rumors
seem to be riven a certain amount of cre
j dene, at least by the intimidated shorts In
I the stock. This strengthens the suspicion
that tha canipaign ;s primarily designed for
the discomfiture of the shorts. But when
Union Pacific to-day began to run off In
face of Southern Pacific's one-point advance,
the conclusion immediately suggested that 'the
- actual conditions in the stock must be out of
joint with the rumors and doubts and cau
tion er.suÂ»Â»d. There was a report, which was
not relUhPd by the bulls, that several hun
dred thousand shares of stocks are now afloat
from London for delivery in New York.
It is customary for lurelsners to sell their
holdings In New York on orders by cable,
while their brokers here borrow the stock
for delivery until the arrival of the actual
certificates, thus adding to the borrowing de
mand for ftocks. Some part of the recent ap
pearance of a larjre short Interest In the mar
ket would thus be Implied to be fictitious.
This report also discredits recent reports of
buying here for London account and to point
to a new York origin for such buying orders.
The influence of crop news was not against
stocks. A favorable influence was caused by
the Price Current's estimate of 2,300,000.000
bushels of corn assured and 90 per cent of
the crop beyond the reach of damage. Warmer
Â¦weather In the corn belt was a relief to ap
prehension of frost damage, but the reports
of rain were received with disappointment,
owiru to the need of warmth to hasten the
ripening of the Brain. Money was reported
a trifle t'asier, although quotations were not
perceptibly altered. The lighter speculation in
Mocks has lessened the demand for loans.
The Fubtreatury is also taking less from
the market than last week, owing to the
monthly hich tide in the disbursement for pen
sions. Sterling exchange also continued to de
cline. The closing was easy. Bonds were ir
repuiar. Total sales, par value. 83,790,000.
United States bonds wÂ»re unchanged.

CHICAGO, Sept. 22. â Under the Influence of
lower cables and favorable weather throughout
the corn belt, wheat opened a trifle easier. De
cember and May both being unchanged to %c
lower at $1 OaTi to $1 09 and $1 10% to $1 10%
respectively. Moderate liquidation by local
traders resulted in an additional decide. De
cember selling off to $1 CS% and May to
$1 10%@l 10y.. The declins apparently was
due more to a lack of demand than to selling.
As the session advanced trading became more
brisk, prospects of rainy weather in the North
west bringing cut a number of buying orders
credited to the leader of the bull clique. The
market gradually assumed a strong under
tone, which developed into decided strength
late In the day. The flour situation in the
Northwest was perhaps the most prominent
factor that contributed to the Improved feel-
Ing In the wheat market here, reports from
Minneapolis Indicating a decidedly Increased
demand. News from the Southwest also was
bullsh, a private message from St. Louis pre
dicting a radical falling off In the wheat ar
rivals The force of this Statement, however,
was largely offset by the day's total primary
recelpta, which were considerably in excess
of those of a year ago. An advance of Â«c in
the price of cash wheat at Kansas City ac
counted for much of the late bullishness of
speculative trading here. The market closed
M-actically at the highest price of the day.
The high point on December was reached at
$110% and final figures -were $110%, a gain
of l%c. May closed l%c up at $1 12%.
Higher temperatures throughout the West
was the main factcr in producing a weak corn
market. The market was weak from otart to
finish. December closid %(ff%c lower at 50c.
Heavy selling by cash houses and liquidation
by local lonss caused weakness In oats. De
cember closed %Â©%c lower at 31%Â®01%c.
Provisions were lower In sympathy with
hogs. Owing to a etrons cash situation there
was considerable bullish talk on lard. At the
close January pork was up 2%c. lard was off
2V,c. and ribs were a shade higher.

CASH WHEAT.
WHEAT â The foreign futures were un
changed.
Chicago was l%c higher, though the weak
ness In Corn caused softness early in the day.
St. Louis and Minneapolis reported milling
Wheat scarce and in demand, as the millers
have a great deal of Flour sold ahead and
must have Wheat.
The Chicago letter of E. F. Hutton & Co.
said: 'It was a hesitating and uncertain mar
lcet. but the close was strong. Southwest was
probably test buyer. They are predicting
smaller receipt* of winter wheat. Receipt* at
primary markets are again large, but millers
everywhere report a good demand for flour and
are themselves good buyers of wheat. This
feature was the principal cause of strong clos
ing. Broomhall cabled this morning about
the appearance of locusts In Argentine, but
it was not taken seriously. The volume ' of
trade is not large but with the email stocks
the market responds easily to buying. So long
as the mills clean up .the offerings of cash
wheat everywhere there does not seem likely
to be much persistent selling."
In this market futures were irregular but
firm. with. buyers disposed to buy on the eoft
spots. The cash grain continued firm and
unchanged. There were heavy receipts of 137,-
SjSO centals from Oregon and Washington.

Aside from some little activity during the
early trade, the fruit market was dull and
featureless, as local wants were light' and
there was very little doing in the 'shipping
line. The market was still overloaded with all
descriptions of table Grapes, except Seedless,
and close buyers were able to shade the quo
tations for all other. kinds.. The Pviget Sound
steamer took out some large shipments, but
most of them had been purchased In the grow
ing districts and were transferred direct to
tha steamer. The canners were offering; $15
per ton for bulk lots of Muscats and secured
a considerable quantity at the 'figures. Wine
Grapes were in good request and firm. Bart
lett Pears were In limited supply and firmly
held, while Winter varieties were being forced
for sale at Irregular rates. Peaches, too,
were in light supply, but they met with a
sluggish demand and prices ranged lower.
Receipts of Apples have fallen off of late
and all dealers reported a good market for
high-grade offerings, but the demand for the
lower grades showed no improvement. There
was very little Inquiry for Berries, and even
the early arrivals dragged badly. Raspberries
did not arrive until late in thf afternoon
and had to be carried over. Citrus fruits
were quiet and Mexican limes were quoted

The mysterious disappearance of the
bond for $5000 accepted by Police Judge
Fritz on July 11, 1903, for the release
of A. A. Kratz, whom he held to an
swer on a charge of felony embezzle
ment, continues to puzzle the officials
of the District Attorney's and County
Clerk's offices. Judge Fritz might be
able to explain the mystery, but no one
seems to know where he can be found.
Judge Dunne has urged an official in
vestigation.
When the Kratz case was called in
Judge Dunne's court yesterday Attor
ney Frank J. Murphy, who represents
the defendant, said he had received
a telegram from V. Kratz. Los An
geles, father of the defendant, that he
would send affidavits by mail as to
the death by drowning of the defend
ant at Long Beach on September 15.
The Judge thought it would be more
timely to make an official Investigation
as to the disappearance of the bond.
It might be a well devised plan in con
junction with other phases of the case
to defeat the ends of Justice. Murphy
agreed that an Investigation would be
in order. If the bond had disappeared
It showed a very lax method in dealing
with such Important" documents. He
would do everything in his power to
elucidate. the mystery.
The Judge said he ha<S no reflection
to make upon Murphy. He trusted it
would no develop that any official of
the city and county had been retained
by the defendant along with his army
of attorneys. The Ballinger case, he
said, was an illustration of how the
administration of justice was hampered
in this city. â¢
Assistant District Attorney Whiting
announced that he had requested Cap
tain Martin and Sheriff Curtis to Inves
tigate the reported death of the defend
ant, but neither had anything to report
as yet. Regarding the bond, he thought
an 'official investigation should be made,
but he was of the opinion that the bond
had been misplaced and . would turn
up. The sureties could be sued whether
the bond was found or not. He under
stood that the defendant's sister. Mrs.
R. M. White;, his father, V. Kratz. and
Attorney .Newhouse were the sureties.
He suggested that the matter go over
until Monday. This was agreed to.
A motion to release W. M. Kratz on
bail was denied by the Judge. He was
tried on the same charge, convicted and
sentenced to serve five years in San
Quentin. He has appealed to the Su
preme Court and wants his liberty
pending the result of the appeal.

"I paid Mrs. Celia Hoff $20 for les
eons. in hair dressing. The best I got
was a lesson in hair pulling."
Such was the plaint of Mrs. Sadie
Swift before Judge Cabaniss yesterday.
Mrs. Hoff keeps an establishment at
694 Sutter street, where Psyche knots
are made while you wait and pompc
dours are built to order. To Mrs. Hoff
came Mrs. Swift, praying to be taught
how to drive home a hair pin without
penetrating the brain of the patient.
Mrs. Hoff agreed to initiate the seeker
after knowledge. She gave Mrs. Swift
a few lessons, which that lady claims
were "just bluffs." Mrs. Swift still
overheated her curling irons and the
bangs constructed looked like the ferry
clock after an earthquake.
Mrs. Swift demanded that the $20 be
returned. Mrs. Hoff declined. Then the
wrath of Mrs. Swift was roused. She
burst into the hairdressing parlors of
Mrs. Hoff like an army of Cossacks.
Vehemently the irate pupil denounced
the teacher. ' In the next room were
several patrons whose locks were in
various stages of manipulation. Sud
denly their hair stood on end so that
several quarts of oil were needed to
sooth the frightened tresses into shape.
Mrs. Hoff laid aside her curling irons
and grasped her unruly pupil by the
hair. With some vigorous yanks she
pulled Mrs. Swift's locks into shape
lessness. For this act the pupil had
the teacher arrested on a battery
charge.
Mrs. Swift admitted having abused
the curling iron artist to the best of
her ability. "Mrs. Swift, you were
hasty," said Judge Cabaniss. "The
battery charge is dismissed." The ar

He hardly seemed to hear the order of

Whether it was the use of opium that
caused it is not known. Judge Mogan
ordered Tenabi to be held twenty-four
hours to give him a chance to recover.
His glassy eyes still seemed to be gaz

taken from the courtroom.
