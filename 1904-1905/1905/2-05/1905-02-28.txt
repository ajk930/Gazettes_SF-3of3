Spurlal DUspatcto to The Call.
â¢CHICAGO. Feb. âThe Interstate
Â" Commerce Commission is defied by the
.Santa Fe Railroad Company in a
statement made by President Ripley
.^to-day. Last Thursday the commis
sion rendered a supplemental decision
Hi the case brought against the Santa
Fe by the orange growers of Califor
nia. In this ruling the commission held
that the Santa Fe's rates on oranges
were unreasonable and unjust, and
that the Santa Fe and the Southern
Pacific were unlawfully engaged in a
* pooling traffic in citrus fruits in
Southern California. In its original
decision the commission had held that
tiie Santa Fe and the Southern Pacific
. were unlawfully' preventing orange
â¢ shippers selecting the roads over which
their fruit should be shipped.
Chairman Knapp dissented from the
opinion of all other members of the
commission, as he believes in pooling
and in the right of railroads to con
. trol the routeing of traffic, regardless
"of the wishes of shippers.

the. commission against the Santa Fe,
President Ripley. gays: '
"The Interstate Commerce Commis

. tue : chairman dissents. There is not
much use in attempting to criticize the
..allegations of this majority decision.
They are all ene-sided and in the na
.lure of a special plea.
"It says that the oraiige shipments
have increased from nothing to 30,000
Jtars a year; that the time is slower
â¢Uian formerly; that the cars carry
more lead; but it omits to mention that
v.ages have advanced about 40 per
cent and material almost 100 per cent;
that a car that used to cost $600 now
costs 'JIOOO; that millions of money
have been borrowed and spent in mak
' ing the railroads equal to the demands
on hem and that millions more must
be borrowed and spent before that will
be accomplished.
."Of course, we shall ignore the de
fcision of the commission and rely on
the courts for justice, because we de
sire to be Just.
l|pi "There is no agricultural pursuit
, which has been as profitable as
orange-growing in California for the

railroads are largely the cause of this
prosperity. Because there have been

proposed to take money from us and
give it to the producer. If the rail

"As to the alleged pool the evidence

there is some law that will compel us

EX-CONVICTS NOVEL
GIFT TO PRESIDENT
Revolver That Cannot Be Fired by
One Unfamiliar With Its
Mechanism.
NEW YORK, Feb. 27â President
Roosevek has a new weapon for his
armory in the gift from "Mart" Allen
of a revolver so constructed that it
can be of service only to its owner.
Attempts to fire it unless one is fa
â¦ millar with its combinations are vain.
Allen invented this peculiar type of
firearm '< while he was a convict in
Sing Sing Prison, after one of several
'convictions for burglary. The idea was
suggested to him when two fellow -
" convicts escaped by obtaining posses
sion of the Warden's revolvers and
hiding him at bay by threatening him
with instant death if he interfered with
them. For such emergencies as ' this
he believed a revolver which would be
of service only In the hands of a man
v.- ho knew the combination by , which
to unlock it would be of great value,
and at the suggestion of Superintend
ent Collins he worked on his idea for
several years. Now that he is free
again he hopes to have his invention
adopted by prison officials and others.

MUKDEN, Feb. 28. â The Russians
report that the Japanese are in pos

between Ta and Kaotouling. The
possession of Ta Pass threatens
Fushun, Tiehling and Hige.svvay. Ta
Pass is regarded as of the same con
sequence to the Japanese in their
operations against Mukden, as was
Motien Pass in relation to Liaoyang.
In case the Japanese push on from
the southeast, there operations will be
among the hills.
MUKDEN, Feb. 27.â The Japanese
crsssed the Shakhe River last even
ing, having driven in the pickets of
the Russian vanguard. Russian sup
ports came up and stopped the Jap
anese advance.
On the right flank all is quiet, but
movements of the Japanese indicate
an intention of attacking the Russian
center, at least in the way of a dem
onstration. Heavy firing continued to
day to the eastward.
The soldiers of the Tsinkhetchen di
vision are in good spirits in spite of
the heavy losses they have sustained
and the necessity which compelled
them to retreat. They are encouraged
by the execution they wrought upon
the Japanese, whose bodies were piled
in heaps outside the redoubts at Beres

khetchen.
Yesterday afternoon there was a vio

ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 28.âAc
cording to press dispatches from Muk
den the Japanese last evening crossed
the Shakhe River, but the place of
crossing was eliminated by the censor.
The advance was checked by Russian
reinforcements. This was the most
important news from the scene of war
to-night. Fighting is continuing on the
Russian left flank with the indications
that the Japanese are planning an at
tack against the center, but the Rus
sians claim their positions are impreg
nable.
A dispatch trom General Kuropatkin,
dated February 26, says:
"The enemy is continuing the of
fensive against the front of our
Tsinkhetchen detachment and has
turned both its flanks. The Japanese
also have advanced against Kantie
Pass, turning our left flank, but all
attacks on Tangu and Beydaling have
been repulsed. The offensive move
ment against Bomapudz also has been
repulsed. At some positions our rifle
men forced the Japanese outposts to
retire. Colonel Gorsky was severely
wounded."
General Kuropatkin, in another dis
patch dated February 26, announced
that the Japanese had commenced
cannonading in the direction of Gauto
and Wanfun passes.

MADYADANI, Manchuria, Feb. 27.â
After fighting of the most desperate
nature, the Russians remained yester
day evening in possession of Che and
Da passes, against which the Japanese
had been flinging themselves madly
from noon until dark. The Russians,
who were greatly outnumbered, sus
tained repeated attacks, some units
losing as high as 70 per cent in killed
or wounded in hand-to-hand fighting
with the bayonet, to which they were
reduced through having fired their last
bullets. In order to hold Da Pass the
last reserves were sent to the firing
line. The Japanese turning operations
in the region of the Gauto Pass were
checked by a battalion of Russian in
fantry and several squadrons of cav
alry, which repulsed the enemy with
heavy loss. The Japanese also tried to
advance upon Nagou and Vanupudzi,
but were repulsed.
The present operations commenced
on February 19, when the Japanese
made a night attack upon Haba Pass,
seven miles south of Tsinkhetchen. On
February 20 they attacked Vanze Pass,
seven miles southeast of the Tfinkhet
dten positions, which themselves are
far in advance of the general front of
the army. The Russians made a coun

rarily gained ground, but on the even

HOTEL FIRE
CAUSES BIG
EXCITEMENT
Windsor Guests Flee
From Flames
and Smoke.
Aged Couple Are Overcome,
but Are Rescued by
Firemen.
Blaze Is Caused by Spontaneous Com
bustion of RubbisL' in an Dn
used Elerator Shaft.
Fire started early this morning in an
old elevator shaft at the rear of the
Windsor Hotel at Market and Fifth
streets, and but for the prompt ac
tion of the employes of the hotel and
the fire department San Francisco
might to-day be mourning over a holo
caust. With both floors of the hotel
filled with more than 120 guests and a
fierce blaze eating through the floors
and halls in the rear of the building, it
would have been only a few seconds
before the entire building would have
been in flames.
At about 12:30 this morning E. P.
Hilton, who formerly lived in the
hotel, was talking with the day clerk.
G. L. Deal, in the front office. His
attention was attracted by shouts and
screams in the rear of the building.
Springing up the stairs he advanced to
the rear of the second floor, only to be
enveloped in increasing waves of
smoke. Peering down the stairway on
the Stevenson street side he saw the
blaze coming from the direction of the
kitchen, eating its way along the cas
ings and up the elevator shaft.
With the assistance of Deal, Hilton
succeeded in arousing the inmates and
clearing the rooms adjacent to the
lame?. By riiia time' th^ nbise ana
tumult had aroused the roomers
throughout the two floors and hasty
preparations were made by the guests
for leaving their places of peril. Hilton
made a desperate attempt to go below
into the kitchen with a view to rescu
ing the Chinese cooks, if any were
there asleep, but the attempt was
futile and he was compelled to retreat.
Later it was learned that the, Chinese
were not in their quarters.
GUESTS DESCEND LADDERS.
By this time the department was
on the scene and Chief Sullivan di
rected the turning in of a second
alarm. Ladders were quickly raised
to the windows on the Stevenson street
side, through which were scrambing
many of the guests in their night
clothing. The coolness of the fire
men gave the frightened inmates re
assurance and prevented any leaping
to the ground, although the flames
could be seen directly behind them
and the heat was becoming intense.
In the front of the house the ele
vator was making many trips, taking
down the partially clad guests, and
the stairways were jammed with men
and women in all stages of attire.
Here A. T. Kendall, the manager, and
the night clerk R. Hutchings, were
urging them to be calm, as the dan
ger was confined to the rear of the
building. Many women were hysteri
cal and a few fainted. This, combined
with the shouts of the firemen and the
ncise of the engines, gave the scene
the appearance of a catastrophe. Over
120 guests had been in the course of
a few minutes aroused from sleep,
huddled down into the street or car
ried out through the windows in the
strong arms of the firemen.
A BRAVE RESCUE.
One of the narrowest escapes was
that of Mrs. Annie O'Connor of Butte,
Montana. She occupied a room next
to the shaft, and with her young
nephew, who slept on a cot, failed to
hear the summons of the hotel em
ployes. Captain Woods and Driver
Lictor broke into the room and car
ried them to the fire escape and thence
down a ladder to the street
Norman Charles and his wife, also of
Butte, were in room 79. They are an
elderly couple and before reaching the
door of their room vere strangled by
the smoke and became unconscious.
They were carried to the hotel par
lor and revived. Mrs. B. Crosby of
Virginia City was also suffocated and
remained unconscious for twenty min
utes.
Mrs. J. E. Ewald reported to the po
lice that she had been robbed of jew
elry, money and a watch amounting to
$150, which lay on her bureau. She in
tended leaving for Los Angeles to-day
and has only her ticket and baggage
checks. Her sister, Ida Gray Scott, re
ported the loss of a gold watch.
Mrs. William Trewelia is the lessee
of the Windsor and the building is
owned by D. Fricot; $8000 insurance n
the furniture will cove^ all loss
Regarding the origin of the con
flagration. Fire Marshal Towe said
that it started among a mass of rub
bish that had been permitted to accu
mulate in the unused elevator shaft
and that the flames were probably the
result of spontaneous combustion.

BIG SLUMP
IN PRICE OF
MAY WHEAT
Special Dispatch to ThÂ» Call.
CHICAGO, Feb. 27.â John W. Gates
and his associates, it is said, have
abandoned the deal in May wheat.
Millions of bushels of the cereal were
thrown on the local market to-day by
the clique houses, causing the prices to
fall with a crash. "*%
The paj>er loss to the Wall street
crowd is estimated at $750,000, comput
ing on the high figures of a fortnight
ago, but they still had a good margin
of profit over the average purchase
price. The slump caused a panic
among the smaller holders who had
been following the bull leader with the
innocent faith of the lamb being led to
the shearing pen.
The" price of May wheat fell to $1 14%.
Less than two weeks ago it sold at
$1 21VÂ£. The closing price yesterday
was $1 18%. The trade was caught un
aware by the severe break to-day and
wheat, bought by outsiders at fancy
prices, was sold at a tremendous loss.
Trading proceeded in the usual way
for about an hour, when without warn
ing the market suddenly started to
tumble.
"Gates has thrown up the sponge!"
the brokers shouted as they saw prices
giving way, and some of the bears
gave vent to their enthusiasm by fran
tically waving their hats. The demon
stration, however, soon took a more
serious turn. The commission houses
that were loaded with wheat on which
margins were fast disappearing, selling
on stop-loss orders, threw the market
into a fever of excitement which quick
ly spread to all parts of the floor and
then to the commission offices through
out the downtown district.
It is difficult to say how far reach
ing the panic might have become if
Armour had not come to the rescue of
the market. That interest bought
heavily around the low point. Other
big houses also came to the support of
the market. Short wheat was covered
in large quantities. These purchases
effected! a partial restoration of confi
dence and brought about a rally which
landed the May price at $1 16*4. After
this the market quieted somewhat.

EXPELLED !
RAILROAD'S
CONTROL IN
NEW HANDS
NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â The report
that E. H. Harriman had lost control
of Union Pacific Railroad gained cur
rency in Wall street to-day, and, while
it could not be confirmed, the belief
was expressed In conservative quarters
that it was not idle gossip. It has
been known for some time that H. H.
Rogers and William Rockefeller each
personally held as large a block of
Union Pacific stock as any one individ
ual; it is believed that Harriman and
his friends retained a sufficient amount
to secure to them complete administra
tive control of the property. On one
hand it was said that James J. Hill
and his friends had secured the stock,
aTid on the other It was asserted that
D. G. Reid and Judge Moore of the
Rock Island Company had it.
Enormous transactions marked the
trading on the Stock Exchange to-day,
the total reaching approximately 2,000,
000 shares. Of this amount about 425,
000 shares represented dealings in
Southern Pacific. The other Pacific
stocks were exceedingly active.
The plunging tactics of powerful
stock speculators apparently were con
centrated on Southern Pacific, with the
result that the tape recorded long
"strings" of quotations running into
10,000 and 20,000 share totals without
interruption. At 70, blocks of thou
sands of shares, aggregating 17,000,
were transferred before the price cross
ed that figure and advanced fraction
ally.
During the closing days of last week
Union Pacific and New York Central
were the leaders in activity and
strength. Though there were large
dealings in those two stocks to-day, it
was apparent that speculative interest
had switched over Sunday and that the
operations of the big dealers were be
ing directed to Southern Pacific.
Less was heard to-day of alleged
deals between the Union Pacific and
Vanderbilt interests, concerning which
scores of plausible and fantastic sto
ries alike were circulated late last
week. The subsidence of reports was
not due, however, to disbelief by the
trading element, but rather to a
change of front in the field ofc activity.
The cause of extraordinary liveliness in
Southern Pacific shares, which led the
market, was generally ascribed to the
belief that dividends on the stock will
be declared shortly.

HORSEWHIP
SETS FIRE
TO MASHER
Special Dispatch to Tin Call.
CHICAGO, Feb. 27.â Leroy Stevens,
24 years old, one of the vermin breed
styled "mashers," was unmercifully
horsewhipped on Saturday by Dr. Rob
ert H. Harvey, a practicing South Side
physician. Stevens for several days
past had been annoying women in the
neighborhood of Twenty-first street
and Calumet avenue. Saturday he
went to the rear of Dr. Harvey's resi
dence and summoned Mrs. Harvey to
the door. Just at this? point Dr. Har
vey, returning from a visit to a pa
tient, turned into the alley. He saw
the man, and turning his horse about,
stopped just out of view. Taking the
whip from his buggy he crawled along
the wall leading into his yard.
AH unaware of his danger Stevens
was talking to Mrs. Harvey. She saw
her husband approaching with the
whip, but engaged the prospective vic
tim's attention. Suddenly Stevens felt
the lash across his neck. Again and
again he was struck. Suddenly smoke
began to curl around the body of Stev
ens and it was seen that his clothing
was afire. In applying the lash Dr.
Harvey had ignited a match in Stev
ens' pocket and in a few minutes his
clothes were ablaze. Not until then
did Dr. Harvey desist in his applica
tion of the whip.
Stevens was painfully but not seri
ously burned, and to-day in the Har
rison-street police station he was sen
tenced to three months in the Bride
well.

Harry Bunkers were expelled from thÂ« .
Senate shortly after, noon to-day. OnÂ«
by one the disgraced senators were

and Senators and spectators, awed by
the teÂ»rrible significance ot it ail,
hushed their voltes while the clerk,
calling the names as rjieasureti as the*

into a new world of endeavor, honest â¢

at his desk, his face white as chalk.
Finally, when * few of his friends
joined him and expressed their sym

gathering up his effects, * departed ito

present to raise his voice on behalX of
the accused. They were alone in the

When the matter "of consideration of

'I would ask." said Wright, inter

"It ip hardly parliamentary for a

Â» "In view of this condition," said
ShnrtridK^. "I move for a division."
The motion was seconded and car

of Bunkers be taken up first,
that of French second. Wright third
and the stricken Emmons last. Lu
kens then asked if the rules did not
fall for the separate resolutions to

that sod) was unnecessary: that this
technicality could be cared for in the
minutes.
The vote on the resolution to expel
Bunkers was then called for. Thirty
four votes were recorded against the
.sed. Shnrtridge voting aye. but in
a voice so low that the clerk did not
h it.
FRENCH GRATEFUL. .
French was the next to be called for
sacrifice. With lowered brows he lis
tened to the call and his face reflected
the growing storm within his breast
m as one by one the' Senators declared
. against his innocence. The vote that
stripped him of his rights as a mem
ber of the Senate was the same as that
on the motion to adopt the committee
resolution, 35 in favor and none
against. .â >
"I am much obliged, gentlemen,"
he said . gruffly, and. rising from his
seat, hurriedly left the chamber. --- '
Wright's case was next taken up,
but the man from San Jose was not
to be thrown out without a fight. "I do
not feel capable at this time," he said,
"of arguing my own case. I ask, how
ever, that this Senate give my counsel,
Mr. Cator, an opportunity to make a
short address to the Senate."
"I move," said Senator Pendleton.
"that Attorney Cator be granted the
privileges of the floor."
;â¢ Belshaw seconded the motion and
â¢ Cator. advancing to the desk, said:
I have no hesitancy in Baying to you that
I do not believe the evidence here Is sufficient
to Justify the expulsion from the Senate of Ell
Wright. The only evidence against Mr. Wright
here Is that given by Joseph S. Jordan a con

opinion therein expressed.
WRIGHT MAKES PLKA.
The dramatic scene of the day Ira*
next to come. Wright, who had been
listening intently to the debate, rose
;ti:d .s.tid in wart:
Mr. President and Fellow Senator*: â¢" I
would not be dcing justice to myself should 1
remain in my seat and permit my expulsion
without a word of protest. 1 want to call your
attention to a remark made by Senator Simp
ton, when, after a protest against oar testiiy
ing had been lodged with the special commit
tee, he Â»aid that the committee could only do
one of two things â permit us to testify or
abandon ti:c proceedings Jiow can you expel
us without giving us the right to be heard in
our own defense V In his recent address to the
Senate against the recession of Yosemlte Sen
atcr Curtln said the Legislature had no right
to take away fr. -i the people something- they
owned without *jvlng them the right to be
hoard. I say to him now that here is a chance
for him to stand by his principles and help
to keep for me something that Is dearer than
life.
I do not believe that the Senate would have
taken the action It has already taken here
to-day had the newspapers remained silent.
But they have hounded and abused me, and all
on Âhe uncorroborated statement of Joseph s.
Jordan. It was testified here hy onÂ»- man that
Jordan told him that he gave me the money
at a certain place Tuesday night and when he
wa* called to the stand here he testified that
h< huC lied to this man; that he did not giv>
me the money at the time or place mentioned
by the other witness, but that he gave It to
me in a lavatory- In some part of this town.
If he lied that time is it not Just as reasonable
to awume that he lied again and that he never
gave me- the money? But again I say if you
will act fearlessly and according to the dic
tates of your own conscience?, unswayed by
the prees. you will not throw me out, for I
â wear before God that I am Innocent.
APPEALS TOO LATE.
Wright's effort was a dramatic one.
but it came too late. Had he stood
thus before the committee, thrown
aside his right to immunity from trial
by demanding that he be sworn, it is
not improbable that the result would
have been different. But to the an
swer tp the call for the vote on the
resolution calling for his expulsion
there was no one that voted to declare
him innocent, though Pendleton and
Rambo remained silent, the last
named deeply affected as he saw ruin
come to the young man, guilty though
he wae. that had pleaded so hard for
another chance. The vote stood 33
in favor of expulsion.
Then came the vote on the resolu
tion condemning Emmons to expul
sion. Thirty-four voted in its favor
and the great scandal was at an end.
Relief was plainly visilble on the faces
of all that a duty so disagreeable had
been disposed of for all time.
Such was the end of the most im
portant if not the most remarkable
case in the history of the Legislature
of California. So far as the records
show, this is the first time a member
of the Senate has been expelled for
bribery, though charges of the kind
have been preferred in the past. The
terms of Emmons, Bunkers and
French would have terminated with
the present session, but Wright was
attending his first session as a Sena
tor.
BOODLERS MUST BE TRIED.
Supreme Court Will Not Grant Writ
of Habeas Corpus.
The Supreme Court yesterday de
nied a petition for a writ of habeas
corpus in favor of Harry Bunkers.
The ex-State Senator complained that
the indictment returned against him
by the Sacramento County Grand Jury
was defective, but the Justices of Cali
fornia's highest tribunal did not deem
the petitioner's argument worthy of
comment and returned the document
with, "writ denied" written across its
back.
Bunkers asserted that the Senate
and the committee of which he was
a member had no authority to in
vestigate the affairs of a private cor
poration, that no bill affecting build
ing and loan associations was pending,
that the matter was wholly outside
the jurisdiction of the Legislature and
that the indictment was therefore in
effective.
The cases of all four boodlers are
affected by this decision of the Su
preme Court and the accused must
now go to trial.
WARM TIME IX LOBBY.
Building and I^oan Legislation Pro

SACRAMENTO, Feb. 27.â The storm
over what Is commonly known as the
Curtin building: and loan bill broke in
the lobby of the Senate to-night and
warmer times to-morrow are expect
ed. Frank Otis, president of the State
League of Building and Loan Associa
tions, "W.. H. Busch and Fred Reese,
! representing the Pacific States Asso
ciation, and D. M. Cuthbert of the
State Mutual Building and Loan Asso
ciation of Los Angeles Vere the cause
of the storm.
They arrived here this afternoon to
fight the Curtin bill, saying that it will
i work a great injustice to the local as
sociations and enrich the nationals, al
ready waxing fat through the favors of
the law. They went among the Sen
ators, pointing out what Cuthbert
branded as unjust provisions. They
also had a loud and lengthy discus
sion with Curtin over the bill and
Senator Hahn, who was one of the
committee that framed the bill, busied
himself making a snap tally to see how
the members stood after the new ar
rivals had concluded their first as
sault.
Senator Hahn also held several con
sultations with Clarence Grange, man
ager of the Phoenix Association, many
of whose suggestions are contained in
the bill. All sides will be heard to
morrow, however, and it is probable
that the bill will be largely amended
before being called for final passage.

FIREMEN'S BILL
DIES DESPITE
WOLFE'S FIGHT
Senate Refuses to
Override Veto
of Pardee.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 27.â Senator
French's last vote in the Senate was
cast this morning 1 in support of that
of Senator Wolfe as a protest against
the veto of Governor Pardee to the bill
reducing the hours of labors of the
members of the San Francisco fire de
!.u unent to twelve a day. When the
question of sustaining the veto of the
Governor came up this morning Wolfe
said that he was not prepared to ask
his colleagues to override the veto, but
that in casting his vote against the
veto he wished it to stand as an ex
pression of his views on the injustice
cf making members of the fire depart
ment of the metropolis labor more
than twelve hours a day.
All the members of the Senate with
the exception of Wolfe and French
voted against the bill.
The Senate finally passed a number
of Assembly bills to-day and sent
them to the Governor for his action.
Mindham's bill making it a misde
meanor for employment agents to
charge a fee greater than 10 per cent
of the first week's wages of clients
or to retain such fee wben such client
does not secure the position offered him
was passed unanimously. Similar ac
tion was taken on Gans' bill prohibit
ing the pledging of arms or other prop
erty of the National Guard.
McKenney's bill providing for the
commitment of all male first offenders
between the ages of 16 and 30 years
to the Preston School of Industry and
the transfer of all inmates of Pres
ton under 16 years of age to Whittier
also passed. Stanton's bill, making it
a misdemeanor to violate any of the
regulations of the State Board of
Health now existing or that hereafter
may be made concerning the pollution
of ice or water, was passed, but not
until after it was pointed out that the
bill was undoubtedly unconstitutional,
as it amounts to a delegation of leg
islative authority to a subordinate
body.
Beardslee's bill, making a wife's sep
arate property liable in certain in
stances for the debts of a husband, was
beaten.
AMI-FIGHT BILL.
Senator Rafctox Busy Keeping; Track
of His Measure.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 27. â Senator
Ralston had a merry hunt to-day try-
Ing to find what had become of his
anti-prizefight bill, which, the author
said, was supposed to be on the third
reading file. Ralston says he did not
discover its absence from the file un
til his attention was called to the fact.
He then went to the chair and got it
raised from the oblivion into which it
had sunk and had it given a half
number. It is now known as sixty
seven and a half on the file and in
event of a majority of the members
not attending the fight at the pavilion
it will be brought up to-morrow for
final passage.
LONDON LANCET
SCOLDS CHICAGO
Special Dispatch to Th* Call.
CHICAGO, Feb. 27.â Referring to the
Chicago stockyards as "those truly
Augean stables," the special sanitary
commissioner of the London Lancet
writes in the issues of the Journal for
January 7, 14, 21 and 28, strongly con
demning the methods employed by the
packers and recommending Btringent
laws for better sanitation for the stock
yards district.
The special corrmissioner was sent
to Chicago last November, and, after
making an exhaustive examination of
conditions, made his report, in which
he declared that the slaughter-houses
and other buildings as they now exist
should be condemned. He recommend
ed that the city of Chicago should
erect an abattoir and should declare it
illegal for individuals to carry on such
enterprise independently.
The investigator says the health of
the world is at the mercy of the unsan
itary conditions prevailing at the Chi
cago stockyards. In his article in the
issue of January 28 he says:
"The mere fact that several Euro
pean Parliaments have felt that the
filthy ways prevalent at Chicago ne
cessitated special legislation against
importations from that town is such
an affront that if there were any sense
of dignity the whole nation would rise
and insist upon the sweeping out of
those truly Augean stables known as
the Chicago stockyards."
The London Lancet is probably the
best known medical Journal in the
world. Its conservatism is proverbial.
KANSAS WILL LOSE NO TIME.
State OH Refinery Bonds to Be Issued

TOPEKA, Kans., Feb. 27. â It was

menced. Warden Jewett of the State
penitentiary will select a site for the
refinery and branch penitentiary at
Peru this week. The people of Peru
will pay for it. Convict labor and
convict-made brick will be used in
the building.
The House to-day passed the Holden
anti-pumping of gas bill. It will now
become a law. The bill prohibits the
use of pumps on gas wells, but permits
compressors on pipe lines.
Investigation of All Trusts.
HELENA, Mont., Feb. 27. â The Sen
ate to-day by a unanimous vote con

where violations of the statutes are
disclosed, to bring proceedings against
the combines.

PRICE OF FORT
HUMBOLDT TOO
HIGH FOR STATE
Roliey's Measure Is
Frowned On in
Assembly.
Special Dispatch :o The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 27.â Senator i
Selvage's hill appropriating $35,000 for j
the purchase of the old Fort Humboldt ;
property close to the city of Eureka j
and the preservation of the buildingtf
thereon, will never pasa tne Assembly,
though it has gone through the upper
house with ease. The companion bill I
in the lower house, which was intro- '
duced by Rolley at the request of Sel
vage, will be allowed to die in the ,
Ways and Means CVmmittee, for which \
Rolley himself is responsible.
It is said that the fifteen acres it '
was intended to purchase for $30,000 ;
are worth less than half the amount
it was intended to i>ay for them, in ;
case the bill became h law. This is at
the rate of $2000 an at re. The measure :
is vague to the extent that if it became
a law the whole amount appropriated
could be used for the purcnase of the
land, as no specific amount is set aside
for new structures or restoring the old i
ones.
When asked by members of the !
Ways and Means Committee of the
Assembly what the land was worth,
Rolley, who is a member of that com- i
mittee, said frankly that it had no
ftuch value as the price it was pro- j
posed ta pay for it. He was given his
choice of which of the two Humboldt
appropriation* he wished reported fay- j
orably, that for the purcnase of the
Fort Humboldt land or the one appro
priating $30,000 for riprap and jetty |
work on the Eel River and he pro- j
nounced in favor of tne latter.
Fort Humboldt has added historic
importance from the fact that General
Grant, then a subordinate officer, was
stationed there in the early fifties. It
is located on what is known now as I
"Humboldt Heights," an addition to
the city of Eureka, but there are no !
residences on or very near the tract, it j
is said.
Senator Selvage says the amount
asked for the purchase of the Fort
Humboldt property is necessary be- i
cause some of the lots in the tract :
have been sold and the owners demand
$500 each for them.
Senator Selvage appeared before
the Assembly ways and means com- \
mittee to-night and pleaded that his
bill be recommended for passage. He i
said the price fixed was the lowest
at which the property could be bought
an*d that before another session of the
Legislature it would go still higher.
It was decided to send Assembly- j
man Jones of San Francisco to Eureka
to look into the matter and report to
the committee, of which he is a mem
ber.
Waieh's railroad crossing bill came
up in the Assembly this afternoon and
the Senate amendments to the mea
sure were unanimously concurred in
and the bill now goes to the Governor i
for his signature.
After visiting the harbor at San
Pedro the Assembly Committee on
Commissions and Public Expenditures
has reported adversely on the bill pro
viding for a Board of Harbor Com- j
missioned for San Pedro.
Chairman Stanton of the Ways and
Means Committee notified the Assem
bly that the committee would present
a resolution next Wednesday fixing the |
time for the adjournment of the Legis
lature. He sriid the date probably i
would be March 11.
LEGISLATURE MUST ACT.
Congressman MeLachlan Urges State
Provision for Reclamation Work.
Congressman James MeLachlan of
the Los Angeles district has written
to the California River Improvement
and Drainage Association urging the
necessity of prompt action by the
State Legislature in order to obtain
Federal aid in carrying out the plans
recently formulated by the commission
of engineers for the control of floods
in the San Joaquin and Sacramento
River valleys. The letter follows:
To the River Improvement and Drainage As
sociation of. California: Yours of the 9th in
stant was duly received. I sincerely hope that
you may succeed in securing some legislation
at the, present pension of this Legislature that
will enable you to legally carry out the gen
eral plan proposed by the board of engineers
which recently examinÂ«d the Sacramento River
and Its tributaries.
I succeeded in procuring a provision in the
present river and harbor bill providing for
three Government engineers to confer with thÂ«
State authorities in regard to the matter of
these rivers. This provision, however will
amount to nothing unieas the State is In posi
tion to know what It can do to carry out that
Improvement.
It is not certain yet that this river and
harbor bill will pass thlÂ» Congress, as there I
are strong Influence* at work to prevent It.
Th 6 general cry of economy is having: Its in
fluence here, and the time Is now very short.
The bill in Its present form will undoubtedly
paes the HouÂ«<\ but I am not ao sure that it '
will oh ?s the Senate.
Our only hope Is In securing the passage
of the present bill. This fact, however, should
not deter you In bringing every Influence to
bear to secure State legislation at the preÃent
session. The great difficulty I had in secur
ing provision in the present bill providing for
the three Government engineers to confer with
the State authorities was that the State was
not in position to confer with such a board,
as no suitable legislation had been enacted;
hence- the Importance that the State have
authority as soon as possible to treat with the ,
Federal Government officials.
Personally I am greatly interested in that
Improvement, and you should educate your â 
people to the fact that thÂ« great contest here
will be to Induce the Federal Government to
Bseume its Just proportion of that great im
provement. When that time comes, it will
require the united wisdom and influence of
all friends of that project to secure suitable
Federal legislation to carry It out.
While we fortunately made good headway
here at this session without special assistance
from your association, yet, from my experience
here. I am going to notify you now that when
the time comes to make an effort to induce
the Federal Government to .assume lta pro
portion of this great Improvement we will need
the assistance of the ablest representatives of
ytour association that can be sent here. I no
tice from the home press that there la a dis
position on the part of some to minimise the
Influence of such committee here, but, from
my four years' experience on that committee,
I know I am right In saying what I have.
and I hope you will get In shape to bring
every possible Influence to bear. Very sinoerely
youn. JAMES McLACHLAN,
__ . United States Congressman.

SENATE PASSES
THE NAVAL BILL
Appropriations for Two
New Battleships Are Re
tained in the Measure
ATTACKS ON PRESIDENT
Gorman, Carmack and Other
Members Oppose Increase
of Nation's Sea Strength
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27.â The Senate
to-day passed the naval appropriation
bill. The measure was discussed by
Gorman, McCumber, Blackburn, Car
mack, Hale, Lodge, Martin, Perkins
and Teller. Hale again criticized the
too rapid increase of the navy, and
Lodge defended the policy of the ad
ministration ir> foreign matters and in
naval increase. The naval bill, as
passed, carries a total appropriation of
5100,300,000.
In answering Hale's remarks made
on Saturday, Gorman said this admin
istration was going beyond the policy
established by England more than a
century ago, and that at this time
such experiments were extravagant
and unnecessary. He referred to the
history of the English navy when it
was used to collect duties from the
American colonies and compared it
with the position of this country in
Santo Domingo to-day.
"I suppose if this is to continue," he
said, "that we will soon have our ma
rines in all of the weaker South Amer
ican republics. The time is close at
hand when the people will not tolerate
these conditions at the cost of trade
interests of the country."
"Every time we build a new battle
ship we have a new spasm of terror
and every time we have the spasm we
build the new ship," said Carmack. in
beginning a speech in deprecation of a
too great increase of the navy. "We
have just elected to the office of chief
executive the most militant and stren
uous gentleman who ever planted his
arm or heel upon our soil. He has in
culcated the love of war for Its own
sake; he teaches that the doctrine of
peace Is destructive to all manly vir
tues; he is infected with an incurable
propensity to interfere with the af-Â«
fairs of other nations, especially with
those of the republics to the south of
us."
He asserted that, from these circum
stances, other nations had a right to
conclude that we were arming for ag
gression rather than for defense.
"Since," he went on, "the President
threw the arbitration treaties into the
fire because the Senate would not sur
render its treaty prerogatives, we have
a right tn conclude that he is intent
upon increasing his own powers rather
than maintaining the peace of the
world."
Hale repeated a prediction made by
himself last year, that if the naval
boards were to be followed the ex
penditure on account of the navy
would not be less than $200,000,000.
which he said the people would not
stand.
Turning his attention to one of Hale's
utterances. Lodge said:
"Something has been said about the
use of the navy to bully small powers.
If a small power does wrong because
it is small it is no more to be excused
than a big country which does wrong
because it is big."
Lodge defended the policy of the
United States in Santo Domingo.
Perkins defended the battleship as
the unit of power in the navy and
urged Congress to follow the advance
of the naval experts in dealing with
the navy.
Carmack's motion to cut out one of
the proposed two battleships was voted
down, 22 to 38.

Illinois Central Announces
Intention of Promptly Re
storing Eazed Terminals
NEW ORLEANS, Feb. 27. â Com
plete figures of the loss involved in
the destruction of the Stuyvesant
docks of the Illinois Central it was
a.n nounced by the local officials of the
â¢ company will not be available until
|an inspection ot" the books of the
! docks is finished. Fortunately all
J these were saved.
The value of the wharves, sheds,
warehouses, elevators and trackage is
known roughly, but the number of
cars and the quantity of merchandise
destroyed cannot be given until the
inspection is concluded. In the mean
time estimates of the loss vary be
tween Superintendent Dunn's figures
of Â§3,000,000 and General Freight
Agent Perkins' aggregate of $6,000.- '
000. The ruins of the fire smoldered
all day. Including the Crescent ice
plant, the police have compiled a list
of approximately forty buildings,
mostly occupied by laborers, which
were destroyed with an estimated loss
of $100,000. Earlier estimates of the |
damage to shipping were modified to- i
day, the principal sufferer being the
Leyland liner Indian Head, on which
the loss is $5000.
With the fire that destroyed its im
mense export terminals still burning, j
though beyond the power to do fur- j
ther damage, the Illinois Central Rail
road announced to-day that as soon I
as the ruins cool forces will be put to
work to clear away the debris and the
Stuyvesant docks and elevators will be
promptly rebuilt on a more elaborate
and substantial scale than before.
Meantime the officials of the road are
to-day engaged in the formulation of
plans that will enable them to handle
the traffic now on its way here from
the West and avoid any material di
version of frieght from this city.
The railroad company carried its
own insurance and the contents of
the various elevators and sheds were
insured in the local and foreign agen- j
cies.
The wharves covered 4050 feet, over
a distance of ten blocks. Of this
wharfage 3500 feet and what it con
tained were destroyed, the remainder
at the upper end of the terminals be
ing saved through the fact that the
wind blew strongly in the opposite di
rection. The destroyed wharf cost
$500,000. Elevator D, leased to Har
ris. Scott & Co. of Chicago, cost $300.
| 000 when built, and Elevator E, which
wag operated by the Illinois Central, |
j cost $400,000.
Apparently no lives were lost in the '
fire, though there were many narrow i
eaeapea of those who were engaged in
fighting the flames.

GIRL'S REFUSAL
COSTS HER LIFE
CHICAGO, Feb. 27.â Miss Mary
Catherine MuJveill, an heiress, was
murdered to-day by Daniel Herman, a
policeman, whose love she had refused.
The crime was committed in the most
fashionable part of Michigan Boule
vard, at a time when the avenue was
filled with pedestrians and carriages.
Herman, after killing the young
Tfcoman, made his escape, and to-night
comrnittpd suicide in a lodging house
at 3165 Archer avenue by shooting
himself through the brain.
The young lady < was returning from
St. James' parochial school, where she
frequently acted as a substitute
.i'"xz*i*T, a.tx&.m_vi rescued the corner~Â«f
Twenty-ninth street and Michigan
Boulevard when she met Herman, who
had evidently , been waiting for her.
What passed between them will never
be known. Suddenly Herman seized
the girl's arm, caught her close to
him and fired three times. One bullet
passed through her brain, one tore off
a finger of her right hand and the
third missed her.
Herman became infatuated with the
pirl through hearing her play at St.
James' Catholic Church, where she
acted as organist, and had for a long
time annoyed her with his attentions,
constantly urging her to marry him.
Herman had been a member of the
Chicago police force for several years,
acting as a 'plain clothes" man. For
about one year he had been on fur
lough.
Miss Mulveill was 22 years old. She
was the daughter .of John Mulveill,
who died several years ago leaving an
â¢estate of $150,000.

necessary to revert to a page of the
bill already passed over, a procedure
also unusual.
Seeing that he had been outflanked
by Burton, Hemenway several times
sought an adjournment after the bill
had been reported to the House for
favorable action, but his motions were
voted down. So clearly were he and
his followers in the minority that Hem
enway interrupted a roll call to move
the passage of the bill, which carried
amid loud applause. The bill carries
a total appropriation of $65,272,280.
Early in the day the conference re
port on the army appropriation bill was
agreed to and a number of measures
pertaining to the District of Columbia
were passed.
CAST FOR "THK PRINCESS

Clever Stanford Students Will Present
Light Opera Written by Member
of tlie Junior Class.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 27.
The cast for "The Princess Enone,"
tho original opera, which will be giyen

The leading woman's part, that of the
princess, is given to Miss Geraldine
Brown, who is by far the best actress
at Stanford now. R. S. Kellogg will
sing the tenor lead of Boggs, the .comi
cal old Stanford professor, who intro
duces civilization and the cocktail into
the land of the ancient Aztec. There
is to be a large chorus of dusky beau

NEGROES SLAY TWO WHITE
PLANTERS IN MISSISSIPPI
Killing: Follows Quarrel and Sheriff's
Posse Now Seeks Blacks, Who
May Be Lynched.
TAZOO CITY, Miss.. Feb. 27. A
difficulty occurring late yesterday af
ternoon between Ed Stevens, a prom
inent planter living near this city, and
four negroes led to the killing of Stev
en? and his brother, W. H. Stevens,
and the wounding of a negro named
Wilder, one of the slayers of the Stev
ens brothers. The negroes escaped.
A Sheriff's posse is now scouring
the country for the quartet of blacks
and a lynching is believed to be inev
itable if the negroes are caught. De
tails regarding the killing of the Stev
ens brothers, which occurred on a
plantation two miles from this city,
are meager.
FEDERAL/ SUPREME COURT
DECIDES AGAINST TRUST
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27.â The Su
preme Court of the United States de
cided the case of the National Cotton
Oil Company vs. the State of Texas,
involving the Texas anti-trust law!
The State court found the company
guilty under that law and held that
It had foreited its right to do business
in the State. The case was appealed
to the Supreme Court on constitutional
grounds. That court, however, in its
opinion to-day, which was delivered
by Justice MoKenna, held that the
charge whs untenable and sustained
the verdict of the court below.
CASE IS WON
BY LOCAL BANK
Federal Supreme Court De
cides Tax Suit in Favor of
San Francisco National
STATE LAW INVOLVED
Method of Assessment Said
to Work Discrimination,
but Judges Not Unanimous
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27.â The Su
preme Court of the United States to
day decided the tax case of the Na
tional Bank of San Francisco favorable
to the bank. The case involved the
State law directing the assessment of
the stock of national banks in Cali
fornia, whjile assessment on State
banks wag made on their property.
The opinion was delivered by Justice
White, who held that the effect of the
law in this case was to work discrim
ination. The finding of the State court
was reversed. The Chief Justice and
Justices Brewer, Brown and Peckham
dissented.
In the course of his opinion Justice
White called attention to the fact that
in assessing bank stock much prop
erty of an intangible character must be
taken into consideration, which is not
true in cases in which the assessment
is made on visible property as is re
quired in the case of State banks.
Concluding his opinion, he said:
Our conclusion does not deny the power of
the State of California to assess shares of
stock In national banks, provided only, the
method adopted does not produce the discrim
ination prohibited by the act of Congress.
From this it would fallow that if the statutes
of California, eithrr from their text or as
construed by the highest court of that State,
compelled the assessing officers in the valua
tion of the properly or State banks and other
State moneyed corporations to include all those
elements of value which are embrace* in the
assessment of shares of stock In national
banlcp, co that there would be an equality of
taxation as respects national banks, the dis
crimination which we find t o exist under the
present state of the law of California would
disappear.
Justice Brewer delivered the dissent
ing opinion, in the course of which
he said:
Whatever may be the effect of the statute
creating or opening the door to discrimination,
no one can read it and say that there was in
tent on the part of the Legislature of Cali
fornia to discriminate injuriously agralnst na
tional banks. The statute is positive in its
language that national bank shares shall be
taxed and assessed as is other property, and
there was beyond doubt an attempt on the
part of the California Legislature to cast only
an equal burden of taxation on such shares.
Of course there cannot be imputed to thif
court an intention to favor national bank
property in The matter of taxation and to lay
down one rule for its benefit which is denied
to all other property.

MAXIM GORKY
TO BE EXILED
Russian Author Is Released
From Prison Only to Be
Banished From Capital
HIS INFLUENCE FEARED
Governor General Trepoff
Besponsible for Harsh
Treatment of the Writer
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 28.â Maxim
Gorky had but a short glimpse of
liberty to-day. Released on $5000 bail,
the noted author was immediately re
arrested and conveyed to a place of
confinement, pending deportation to
some distant city or province, where
his continued resistance, it is believed,
will not be so dangerous to the welfare
of the Government as It would be here
in St. Petersburg.
The release of Gorky was effected by
order of Governor General Trepoff,
after the friends of the writer had
overcome obstacle after oostacle and
won the grudging consent of the
hierarchy and officials to the signing
of the mandate admitting him to jail.
The re-arrest also was the act of the
all-powerful Governor General, who is
unwilling to allow such a firebrand to
be at large in the capital, of which
Trepoff is practically the supreme
ruler.
Disappointed as w,as Gorky at the
outcome of the day's business, he was
no more so than were his wife and
children, who had been informed of the
decision to release him on bail and
awaited his return home for hours.
When a press representative visited
the apartments occupied by the
author's family the windows were bril
liantly lighted in honor or the expect
ed appearance of the husband and
father.

LONDON, Feb. 27. â Captain James,
the well-known war correspondent of
the Times, who has been spending a
short time in Russia watching the pro
gress of events in that country, ar
rived in London this morning. The
Call correspondent mentioned that he
understood that Captain James had
suggested the probable early collapse
of the Japanese military offensive.
Captain James replied:
"That is not quite an accurate in
terpretation of my opinion. What I
actually said was that the Japanese
army was, I believed, not now in a po
sition to deliver a really crushing de
feat, since, to quote a well-known mili
tary phrase, only numbers can anni
hilate, and the Russians have had all
winter to make up any disparity be

growing out of anti-Government dem
onstrations on the part of the Jewish
strikers. The latter paraded the
streets, forcing ' a stoppage of work
and shouting "Down with the Czar,"
"Give us equality." A rope had been
placed around the statue of Alexander
111 with the object of overturning it,
when the police dispersed the crowd.
Some unimportant conflicts occurred
between Christians and Jews, the for

PAROLE BREAKERS PUNISHED.
Runaway Officers of the I^na Mast
Return to Mare Island.
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 27. â
Yielding to the demands of the United
States, Russia has not only ordered
the officers of the cruiser Lena who
violated their parole to return to San
Francisco, but has reduced them one
grade as punishment. The only ex
cuse offered was their youth.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27.â The an
nouncement that the Russian Govern
ment has directed three naval officers
who broke their paroles and escaped
from the Lena at San Francisco to
return to that ship was received with
gratification at the Navy Department,
principally because Admiral MeCalla,
who is directly responsible for the de
tention of the Lena's personnel, will
be relieved from what otherwise
might be the disagreeable necessity of
abolishing the shore leaves tor the
Lena's officers and crew in the future.
The action alao relieves the State De
partment from making explanation to
Japan for permitting a breach of neu
trality such as might be properly
charged if Russian sailors interned
under conditions imposed in the Lena
case were allowed to escape.

during the present agitation. The
peasants hitherto have not figured to
any great extent in this agitation,
which is confined to the 2,000,000

Socialists recently sent emissaries into
the country districts for the purpose
of stirring up the villagers. Accord

NO JUDICIAL
GRIST GROUND
Courts Thrown Into Tem
porary Confusion by Death
of Sheriff John N. Bishop
CORONER TAKES CHARGE
Trial of David Kiniry for
the 3[urder of Policeman
James Smith Is Postponed
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 27.
The death of Sheriff John N. Bishop
yesterday has thrown the judicial sys
tem of the county temporarily into
confusion and no work was done to
day in the courts. Judges Greene, Og
den, Hall and Ellsworth, with District
Attorney Allen, held a consultation in
ideavor to find some statute pro
viding for the conduct of the office
pending the tilling of the vacanacy by
the Board of Supervisors. While no
express provision could be found, it
was tacitly agreed that Coroner H. B.
M'lirmann should take charge of the
office. This he did and this afternoon
a] pointed all the present force in the
office as his deputies.
owing to the grave doubt in the
mind of Judge Greene as to whether
court could be held without a legal
bailiff, the case of David Kiniry,
charged with the murder of Police
man James H. Smith, which was to
have been begun before him this
morning, was postponed until March
7 and the witnesses and jurors dis
missed.
District Attorney Allen said that
while the old law of 1851 and 1853
authorized the Coroner to take charge
of the Sheriff's office in the case of
his death, the revised law had no such
provision and only a general idea that
this was intended could be found in
the later statutes. With the death of
the Sheriff also go his appointments
and until some one takes charge and
appoints deputies there are no legal
officers. Xo writs nor attachments
were served to-day.
The Board of Supervisors received
the news this morning and adjourned
out of respect to the memory of Sheriff
Bishop. They will convene next
Thursday and it is expected will ap
pcint his successor at that time.
There was general sorrow around
the county offices to-day. The flag upon
the Courthouse was placed at half
. and, as far as possible, busi
ness was supended. Arrangements
have been made for the funeral, which
will take place on Wednesday after
noon at 2 o'clock from Alcatraz Hall,
West Oakland. The service will be
under the charge of Alcatraz Lodge of

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1905,
PERRINE FINDS SEVENTH
SATELLITE OF JUPITER
Famous Lick Observatory Astronomer De
termines Position and Orbit of a Won
derful New Moon of Giant Planet
PROFESSOR C. D. PERRINE OF THE LICK OBSERVATORY ON* MOUNT HAM
ILTON, WHO HAS ADDED TO HIS ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE REALM OP
ASTRONOMY BY THE DISCOVERY OF SEVENTH SATELLITE OF JUPITER.
BERKELEY, Feb. 27.â Rivaling in
importance the discovery by Professor
Perrine of a sixth satellite of Jupi
ter, which discovery was made last
month at the Lick Observatory, comes
a second announcement to-day from
Director Campbell, who informs Pres
ident Wheeler of the State University
that Professor Perrine has discovered
a seventh satellite.
In the opinion of Director Campbell
this latest discovery of Professor Per
rine reveals "one of the most inter
esting: bodies in our entire solar sys
tem." The facts concerning the dis
covery and the circumstances under
which the Lick Observatory astron
omer made his extraordinary find in
the heavens are contained in the fol
lowing letter to President Wheeler:
Lick Observatory, University of California.
February 27. 1905.
It gives me great pleasure to announce that
another satellite of Jupiter has been dircov
rred by Assistant Astronomer Perrine of the
I. irk Observatory Htaff. It will be known a*
eventb satellite. The discovery was act
ually made on January 6 last, but announce
in, nt of the fact was not justified until the
present time.
The sixth satellite, first observed by Profes
sor Perrine on photographs taken early In De
cember, was next recorded on the photographs
of January 2, 3 and 4, and public announce
ment of the discovery waa made on January 5.
The following day Mr. Perrine resumed his
comparative examination of the negatives se
cured on the last three dates, and was re
warded by discovering the Image of a very
faint body â which changed Its position from
night to night. It was moving in such a way
that the probabilities were in favor of Its be
ing a satellite of Jupiter; but, at the same
time, the possibility existed that It was one
of the large group of asteroids whose orbltn
He between those of Mars and Jupiter. This
question could not be resolved until obser
vations of the new body had extended over
several weeks. Unfortunately, the unfavorable
weather In January prevented the securing of
exposure* long enough to record this faint
object until January 28. This observation
d.d not fully resolve the doubt as to the char
acter of the object. Photographs secured by
Mr. Perrine on February 21 and 22, and hiÃ
computations based upon them, have enabled
him to decide definitely that this body Is a
satellite of Jupiter. Its photographic magni
tude seems to be about the sixteenth. The
number of telescopes which would permit
visual observations of it Is therefore limited.
The direction of this seventh satellite from
Jupiter, on the evening of February 22, was
57 degrees east of north, and Its distance
from the planet was nineteen minutes of arc.
Its motion is carrying it southeasterly at the
rate ot one minute of an arc per day. Its ap-'
parent motion around Jupiter Is In the direc
tion that astronomers would describe as direct.
The apparent motion of the sixth satellite,
on the contrary. Is In the reverse direction.
Whether these satellites are actually revolv
ing around Jupiter in the same direction aH
the five inner satellites, or in the opposite
direction, cannot be stated at the present time.
It In certain, however, that the planes of thr-ir
orbits make a considerable angle with each
other, and that they make large angles with
the plane of Jupiter's equator. The distances
of the two satellites from Jupiter are not very
unequal. In both cases probably lying between
plx millions and eight millions of miles. Their
corresponding periods of revolution around the
planet would, therefore, be seven or eight
months In each case. On many accounts these
two satellites promise to be among the most
interesting bodies in our entire solar Bystem.
Mr. Perrine is computing their orbits around
Jupiter, but several da.ys will probably pass
before further facts can be communicated. It
is also a pleasure to say that these noteworthy
discoveries were made from photographs se
cured with the Crossley reflector, whose mod
ern remounting, substantially completed about
December 1, was provided for by funds from
the University of California and from Mrs.
Phoebe A. Hearst, the undertaking of the work
having been made possible by the generous
contribution of Mrs. Hearst for this 'purpose.
W. W. CAMPBELL.
Some Startling Star Facts.
BERKELEY, Feb. 27. â Observa
tions recently made on, the orbif of
the bright double star Slrius are de
scribed in Lick Observatory Bulletin
No. 70, just issued by the university.
The period of one revolution is forty
n)ne years, the companion star having
about one-half the mass of the bright
star, whose motion during the last
nine years is shown to have been
relatively toward the solar system.
The same bulletin describes nine stars,
whose velocities in the line of sight
are variable, owing to their being at
tended by massive invisible compan
ions. The invisible component in each
case causes the bright start to revolve
in an elliptic orbit round the center
Of mass. The most interesting of these
is the well-known Castor. Oberva
tions with the Mills spectrograph
proved that Castor's two components
rf-volve around each other in nine days
sixteen hours. The North Pole star,
known to be a triple star, has a com
pound motion, the bright star and
one companion revolving around their
renter of mass in three days twenty
three hours and this rapid binary sys
tem in turn revolving around the cen
ter of mass of the three stars in ap
proximately twelve years.
JILTED WOMAN SEES
CHAXCE TO RECOVER
Sues on Judgment for $4258 50
Awarded Ten Years Ago in Breach
of Promise Action.
OAKLAND, Feb. 27. â A suit ten
years old, the outcome of a breach of
promise case decided in favor of Jo
hanna Albertson of San Francisco In
1894, against Joseph S. Calderia,
whereby $4258 60 was awarded her
for the deception practiced, was re
vived in the courts to-day.
Miss Albertson was never able to
collect anything on her judgfnent, as
she never could find any property in
Calderia's name. Recently, however,
it was discovered that a small ranch
purchased by Calderia from F. I. Le
mos at Haywards had been trans
ferred by Calderia to his wife four
days after the judgment had been
rendered against him. It was trans
ferred by her to Joseph King and
from him to J. B. Mendonca, and an
effort is now to be made to have these
transfers declared fraudulent. The
property Is now worth about (3000.

FEARS TO FACE
INVESTIGATION
Woman Found Begging
Puns Away From Officer of
the Associated Charities
FIGHTS FOE LIBEETY
Miss Helen Swett Has Ex
citing Experience With
Smooth Female Impostor
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway. Feb. 27.
Fearing an investigation by the
Associated Charities, which she knew
must expose her as an impostor and
bring punishment for begging, A
woman giving her name as Airs. Smit||
and her residence as 1421 McAllister
street, this morning forcibly released
herself from the custody of Miss Helen
Swett, the assistant secretary of the
association, and sought safety in
flight. Miss Swett attempted to de
tain the woman until she could sum
mon a policeman, but her captive
broke away and escaped.
The impostor has long been working
in Oakland. This morning Miss Swett
was notified by telephone that she was
at a private residence on Walsworth
avenue. The assistant secretary at
once drove to the house. The woman
agreed to accompany Miss Swett to
the office. She made no resistance
until they "were near the door of the
office, when she turned and ran to
Fifth street and boarded a car. Miss
Swett followed. Seeing she would be
overtaken, the woman left the car.
Miss Swett attempted to hold her, but
she tore herself away and ran down
Fifth street to Franklin, where she
disappeared.
About two weeks ago the Associated
Charities was notified that the woman
was working in the neighborhood of
Filbert street. She gave her name in
one place as Mrs. Barry and in another
as Mrs. Reed, and her address as 315
Wood street and 450 William street.
There are no such numbers. Her story
is that she is the mother of five
children and that her husband is out
of work; wherefore she asks tempor
ary aid.

to remain in this city for at least a
week at the St. Francis Hotel, but
yesterday he countermanded his order
for rooms. It was later learned that
Sunday morning he was taken serious
ly ill. It was decided to abandon his
proposed visit to San Francisco, and
yesterday the Southern Pacific officers
were requested to have his car trans
ferred to Oakland preparatory to
sending It East over the Central Pa
cific.

PROMINENT SPEAKERS TALK
ON PHASES OF MANHOOD
Subject Is Ably Discussed Before
Berean Society of Calvary
Presbyterian Chnrch.
The phases of physical, mental and
spiritual manhood were ably discussed
at the meeting of the Berean Society
at Calvary Presbyterian Church last
night. In speaking of physicial man
hood, Colonel J. P. Irish said, for the
safety of the nation, its people should
preserve Its physical strength. He re
ferred to the decline of the Germans
following the wars of Frederick the
Great. Then came Father Jan, who,
organizing the athletic society of
Turners, In a few generations restored
the German physique and fitted them
for future conquests.
Rev. John Hemphill had spiritual
manhood for his portion of the sub
ject. He said he believed in the full
development of physical and mental
manhood, but that if a man neglected
the spiritual he could not be a whole
man.
S. M. Shortridge, who was to speak
on "Mental Manhood," was unable to
be present and A. B. Black spoke in
his place. He said that the mentality
of the man must be attended to and
without mentality man would be a
great, big machine.
Reginald E. Keene sang two num
bers, that were exceedingly well ren
dered.

BOARD FEARS
A BIG DEFICIT
Supervisors Call Halt on Ex
penditures Made by Heads
of Municipal Departments
FUNDS AEE OVEEDEAWN
Formal Authorization Must
Be Eeceived Before Under
ground Work Is Done
The Board of Supervisors yesterday,
acting on the recommendation of the
Finance Committee, called a halV on
the expenditures of the city govern
ment in order to prevent a prospective
deficit of large proportions in the
funds at the end of this fiscal year.
Auditor J3aehr informed the commit
tee that the heads of municipal de
partments are overdrawing their funds
in violation of the one-twelfth clause
of the charter.
"If this continues." said Baehr. "we
will have a condition similar to that
of ten years ago when the city was
compelled to default in the payment
of bills aggregating a large sum."
"Public notice should be given to
the merchants of the acts of our
boards and commissions in overdraw
ing their appropriations, which will
result in the city's inability to pay
legal demands," said Supervisor d'An
cona. I
â¢ The board adopted the following
resolution:
Resolved. That the various officers, depart
ments and boards of this city and county bÂ«
and are hereby directed to file with the Board
of Supervisors a statement showing the out
standing liabilities of their respective depart
ments up to March 1 next.
The Finance Committee directed
the Board of Works to Invite bids
for the blasting of the hill along the
Cliff House road, on the outer edge
of which a concrete parapet to to be
built to cost $4500. Commissioner
Aigeltinger explained that after an
inspection he had come to the con
clusion that the roadway should be
widened in order that the parapet
may be built on the road instead of
on the edse of the cliff which would
necessitate a parapet 100 feet high
in some places. The Sutro estate
will be notified to protect its lands as
it is designed to build a roadway at
least 100 feet wide.
The Finance Committee began an
inquiry into a deficit of $7800 in the
County Hospital fund. Warden
Fleming contended that the deficit
was $6500, and agreed to file a state
ment of the liabilities of the institu
tion on March 1.
The Board of Works reported a de
ficit in the Bureau of Buildings and
stated that unless an extra allowance
of $5000 was made it would be com
pelled to lay off a number of me
chanics and stop repairs. Action was
deferred until a statement of ' ex
penditures is filed.
The committee decided to hold next
Monday an tnvestigatfon or me ex
penditures out of the Robinson and
Windell bequest fund. Supervisor
Payot contended that any society not
giving aid to children and women
should be eliminated from the list of
beneficiaries under the specific terms
of the two bequests.
The Board of Supervisors adopted
a resolution notifying the Department
of Electricity that for all underground
work to be performed after March 15.
1905, formal authorization must be
first obtained from the board.
The board rassed to print the
amended ordinance requiring a per
mit to be obtained from the Board
of Works as well as the Department
of Electricity for the installation of
poles and wires on the streets and
sidewalks.

Foreman Andrews and Chairman E.

committee yesterday sent a communi
cation to the Police Department call
! ing its attention to a statute that pro
hibits the display of obscene picures
to public graze and suggested that th j
law should be enforced against many
storekeepers in the city.
"The show windows of many sta

time that a stop is put to the disgrace.
I have seen women attracted to i
brilliant show window and when they
had stopped for closer inspection
weHI shocked at the nasty sight, turn
ing away with faces crimson. Th.c
statute must be invoked."
A letter was also addressed to the
Board of Public Works setting forth
that the buildinjr at 620 Jackson
street, the scene of the Grand Jury's
most exciting raid, does not comply
with the ordinances in many particu
lars. It was erected after the passage
of the ordinances and as the walls

1 1 VER Fac-&miio Signafjrt"OTHELLO" SUNG BY SAVAGE'S
ENGLISH GRAND OPERA COMPANY
CHORUS IS A VERY BRILLIANT ONE!
Sheehan Proves a Pleasing Tenor, Winfred Goff a Personable
lago, and Miss Rennyson a Handsome Desdemona.
; San Frar.cisco is half way to Milan
hi grand a])csa latitudes, and possibly
the Henry Savage English Grand Opera
Company that made its debut at the
Columbia last night felt it a little that
way. We rather did. Italian opera
done by the supple Latin has been
mother's milk to us, ours for "vans
and yahs"â as Mrs. Campbell says,
and 'Othello." sung in English by an
American company of singers is In
deed the new thing.
It Is too new yet for one to know
if one iikes it. Wonderfully provincial
or something else we Americans are in ,
This fashion. Will France listen to
Wagner in German, think you. or Italy '
â izet in French? Hardly. These
curiously consider it an essential to the <
comprehension of the opera to under
stand what the 6ingens are singinp
about. We here quite comfortably and
cealously Fit through an crpera wholly
unknown to us. lazily grateful when
we can untangle the hero from the
villain, but not at all anxious about so
doing if the heroics and the villainy
are sufficiently good music.
The attitude has its advantages. In
German, Italian and French, moet of
the opera? worth while are written, and
the translated libretto, be it ever so
pood, goes only limpingly in compari- '
â  ith the original. Amazingly one
found last night that even "Othello,"
re-Englished by Hueffer from the
Boito Italian libretto, does not run '
trippingly off the singing tongue. Ttt 1
Mr. Hueffer's is an extraordinarily
'ul translation. It was. too. grace- :
fully amended in many places by the ,
F.ngors. who. also. m<>st of them, sing ,
gracefully their mother tongue. But, '
at itF mr.st fortunate and musical,
IMM does not nnd that the English word
supports the favorite contention of !
many singers that it is equally musi
cal with the Italian, nor that so far the
added clearness compensates for the
of musical value.
reverent, earnest, unpretentious â 
and thoroughly workman-like per- ;
formance was that given last night by
Ifr. Savape's c.ompany. There are no
â save, perhaps, the chorus- which
\-raordinarily alive and skillful,

Soecia! Attention to Mall Orders I
Gaff's laeo has much to commend it.
The singer's voice is smooth, resonant
nnd distinctly pleasing, though not
rful, and be sings in agreeable and
cultivated fashion. Then. too. Mr.
<iÂ«iff makes a graceful and personable
pi< ture In some remarkably handsome
1 -<istuiv.es and acts the villain with fair
conviction. Joseph Sheehan was the
Othello and possesses a conspicuously
pleasing tenor. The concerted work
for tenor and baritone, by the way,
was most agreeable in respect to the
admirable blend of the two voices.
Mr. Sheehans voice is not powerful,
but it has a peculiarly sweet quality
and a remarkable range and much ar
tistry of delivery. He acts also with
more conviction than his associate, but
âbut, oh, well, there was never a mo
ment w ith either of them, with any of
the cast, of the abandon, elan, slap
ping, gripping something that those
graceless Latins drop into with a kick
from the overworked prompter's toe!
It is the difference between talent and
genius, conscience and temper.
The Desdemona was Miss Gertrude
Rennyson, and a handsome and well
voiced Desdemona. Miss Rennyson is
a little variable in her methods, some
times singing quite pleasingly, at other
times with a curiously smeary attack
that detracts much from the pleasure.
There is a whole lot of the voice; it is
fresh, round and full, and promises to
be useful in the Wagner repertoire.
Miss Rennyson. too. should look the
parts, as she did with the Desdemona.
Of the smaller parts pleasantly
virile, both in voice and acting, was
Kepinald Roberts' Cassio: Miss May
Walters sufficed as Emelia and Harri
son W. Bennett supplied a note of
distinction as Lodovico.
Mi. Kmanuel. the conductor, was
useful, alert, skillful, without any par
ticular distinction. The measure i>f
the houseâ really a Mozart sizeâ had
Dot been fully taken last night, and
tluere was quite frequently too much
of the large and good orchestra. There
wasn't enougrh of the chorus â only that
was Mr. Verdi's fault. The Savage
chorus is one of the very best that has
ever come this way. And to hear all
this there was a house that would have
honored the Tivoli. The opera will be
repeated on Thursday evening and Sat
urday matinee, and t->-night there is
"Carmen."

TRIPLE TRAGEDY
IN THE SOUTH
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VIPALIA, Feb. 27. â Frank Elster
murdered his wife, shot to death Mil
ton S. Hubbs. and then, to free him
pelf from the worry and strain of a
trial, turned the smoking gun to his
own head and blew out his brains
yesterday .at Springville. Infidelity is
alleged to be the cause of the triple
killing. For some time Elster had
suspected his wife of infidelity, and
charged several men with frequenting
his house while he was absent.
Shortly after his breakfast yesterday
Elster left his home to Fee a neighbor
but half a mile away. After transact
ing what business he had with this
man, Elster started back home and on
the road he met Hubbs, who was rid
inp In a buggy with a friend named
Blake. Elster stopped the men in the
road. They were on their way to Por
terville to play a game of ball. As
Hubbs and Blake brought their horses
to a stop Elster walked up on the side
of the vehicle occupied by Blake and
handed the latter a letter which he
asked him to mail. At the same time
he drew a revolver, leveled it at Hubbs
and fired two shots in rapid succes
sion. Both bullets took effect in the
body of Hubbs and he fell over in the
buggy feat. Blake attempted to turn
the vehicle around, intending to hasten
to Srringville for assistance, but El
ster ordered Blake at the point of the
revolver to proceed down the road. El
ster fired another shot, which took ef
fect in the neck of Hubbs.
After shooting Hubbs Elster turned
and started across the fields for his
home. When he arrived his wife was
Bone, but his two little girls, aged
eight and ten were in the house alone.
Elster knew that his wife was but a
short distance away, and he went
across the road to the Dillon home to
find her. He knocked at the door and
Dillon came to answer the call. The
latter knew that trouble was brewing^
and told Elster to postpone an inter
view with his wife. Elster insisted
that she come out, and Dillon stepped
into the dining-room and called Mrs.
Elster out. While Dillon was gone
Elster stepped into the hallway, and
as his wife approached he grabbed her
by th^ arm and said: "Come out on
the porch. I want to talk with you."
Mr?. El?tor refused to leave the
house, and while he was holding her
by one j'.rm he fired two shots into
her breast. He released his hold on
her and she turned to go into the bed
room. As Phf walked away Elster
fired another shot into her body and
she fell.
Elster walked out into the front
yard and blew out his brains by firing
a bullet into his left temple.

Heinrich, by Landers Stevens, was
nicst satisfactory, notwithstanding the
handicap of the unavoidable compari
son with Richard Mansfield. Harry
Mestayer, as the rollicking Graf yon
Asterberg; George Woodward, the Dr.
Juttner of the cast, and Orral Hum

into their work. Mr. Woodward's per
sonation was admirable, especially in
the tipsy scene, which was played
strictly within bounds. Kathie, the
Prince's sweetheart, portrayed by Jane

the soul of the piece and scored one
of her greatest successes in comedy
parts. John Davies was effective as

were well sustained.

ELEVEN PERISH
IN A CHURCH
NEW YORK, Feb. 27.â Eleven per
sons were killed and more than fifty
injured, some probably fatally, by the
collapse of the decayed supports of the
flooring of the Fleet-street African M.
E. Church in Brooklyn to-night. Of
those killed eight were women, two
men and one child.
Those killed were: Bertha Green.
Teresa Ellis, Samuel Chisholm, Anna
Bean, Anna Sullivan, Louisa Smith,
Mary Scott, two unidentified women,
one unidentified child and one uniden
tified man. Death in nearly every case
resulted from suffocation.
The building was an ancient, ram
shackle frame structure erected sixty
years aero in the heart of the negro
section of Brooklyn, in Fleet street,
near Myrtle avenue. It was condemned
as unsafe several years ago.
Arrangements had been made to
night to hold funeral services over the
remains of Sidney Talnter, one of the
older members of the church, and the
auditorium, which is on the second
floor of the building, the ground floor
being used by the Sunday-school, was
crowded with an audience of more than
300 persons, of whom the majority were
women.
The congregation was waiting in si
lence for the arrival of the body, and
Pastor Jacobs was standing at the al
tar awaiting the summons to meet the
funeral procession at the door, when
a splintering of timbers was heard, and
In an instant the half of the audito
rium nearest the door collapsed, car
rying down more than a hundred per
sons, who were crushed in the wreck
age of the flooring and pews. A great
volume of dust for a few moments hid
from view the victims. The remainder
of the audience, finding themselves cut
off from the door, and expecting every
instant that the rest of the flooring
would collapse under them, fought
madly to reach the windows, and in
some instances leaped from them and
sustained serious injuries.
MACEDONIAN PROBLEM
DISCUSSED IN COMMONS
British Government Will Xot Under
take Reforms Independently of
Other . Nat ions.
LONDON, Feb. 27.â 1n the House of
Commons to-day during the debate in
reply to the speech from the throne,
Stevenson (Advanced Liberal), intro
duced an amendment declaring that
the time had arrived for the Govern
ment to take steps to insure the exe
cution of reforms in Macedona by the
appointment of Christian Governors
responsible to the powers.
Earl Percy, Under Secretary for For
eign Affairs, replying, said the Gov
ernment was not satisfied with the
progress made, but was not prepared
to press the matter unduly. He de
clared that the villagers often exag
gerated their grievances and the acts
of the Turkish Government. Ever
since the reform scheme had been in
augurated there had been sickening ac
counts of outrages, but the Under Sec
retary did not believe the races in the
interior of Macedonia would consent to
come under any European power The
British Government did not propose to
allow its hand to be forced.
Bryce (Liberal) severely criticized
the Under Secretary's speech. He said
It showed a lack of sympathy which
nullified the good effect of Foreign Sec
retary Lansdowne's preparations.
Premier Balfour said it would be im
possible for the British Government at
the present stage of the scheme of re
forms to separate itself from the
agreement between the powers.
The amendment of Stevens was re
jected without a division.
BUYS SUPPLIES
WITHOUT BIDS
Panama Eailroad Acts as
Purchasing Agent for Isth
mian Canal Commission
SHOULD BE ADVERTISED
Committee of Investigation
Discovers Violation of
President's Instructions
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27.â After de
claring its investigation of the Pan
ama Railroad Company closed last
week, the Special Sub-Committee of
the House Committee on Interstate and
Foreign Commerce to-day struck a
new lead which was pursued with vig
or in an examination of Vice Presi
dent E. A. Drake and Alfred Ander
son, purchasing agent of the road. It
developed that for six months, begin
ning early in May of last year, the
railroad company had acted as the
purchasing agent for the Isthmian
Canal Commission and that a total of
$215,000 worth of supplies had been
purchased in this manner without pub
lic advertisement for bids.
Mr. Drake in answer to a question !
! as to whether he was aware of the in
structions of President Roosevelt re
garding the purchase of supplies, said
that he was. and had called the same
to the attention of the canal commis
sion. Admiral Walker had told him
that the purchases were not covered by
that order, as they were "emergency"
requirements. Drake maintained that
i from 25 to 33 per cent had been saved
; to the Government in the purchases
made by the railroad
This is regarded as a violation of
paragraph 4 of President Roosevelt's
ietter of instructions to the commts- j
sion under date of May 9, 1904, which
makes it the duty of the commission
"to make and cause to be executed,
after due advertisement, all necessary
contracts for any and all kinds of en
gineering and construction works."
In detailing to the committee how it
happened that the railroad had made
purchases for the commission, Drake
said that shortly after the railroad
property was transferred, or after the"
stock had been acquired and prior to
the transfer of the road to the Govern
ment, General Davis and Major Brooks
requested certain supplies for which
they made requisition on Admiral
Walker, chairman of the commission, j
"The chairman had recently been
elected a director," he continued, "and
was at the office and with the gen
eral idea that the railroad wa9 about
to become a part of the Government's
property he availed himself of its fa
cilities for purchasing supplies."
"Did you purchase any lumber in
California?" asked Mr. Townsend.
"We had bids from California," he
replied, "but had not accepted any up
to the time the matter was taken out
of our hands by Mr. Grunsky."
It was stated later that an order
for between two and five million feet
of lumber had been placed on the Pa
cific Coast by the Canal Commission.
Drake said Grunsky had contended
that Pacific Coast lumber was cheaper
and just as good. Drake said his fif
teen years' experience with lumber in
the tropics had led him to the opin
ion that the porous character of sea
coast lumber unfitted it for use in
Panama. He understood, however,
that the lumber was cheaper. Al
though questions were asked as to
whether D. O. Mills was interested in
the California lumber purchase, Drake
had no information on the subject.
Admiral Walker, chairman of the
Panama Canal Commission, in an in
terview to-night justified every act of
the commission in the matter of pur
chases of supplies. Every purchase
that had been made through or from
the railroad company.'Admiral Walk
er declared, was made for the pur
pose of obtaining the best terms and
best results in the interest of the Gov
ernment, and time and money had
been saved thereby.
EVANGELICAL CATHEDRAL
CONSECRATED IN BERLIN
Emperor William Hopes to Be Desig
nated as the Protector of
the Faith.
BERLIN, Feb. 27.â Emperor Wil
liam's Mecca for Protestants, the
Evangelical Cathedral here, was con
secrated to-day in the presence of a
brilliant assemblage, among which
were delegates from all the Protestant
nations. The service was simple and
stately and was enriched by wonderful
music
Bishop Potter of New York and a
long list of American clergy sent a
telegram of congratulation to the
Emperor.
The Emperor and Empress, having
upon one eide of them Prince Arthur
of Connaught and on the other Crown
Prince Frederick of Denmark, with
thirty-two Princes and Princesses of
German states, sat in the gallery oppo
site the altar, attended by heralds in
parti-colored costumes, with enormous
plumed hats. The Emperor, ' standing
in the wide vestibule, took a key from
the chairman of the building com
mission and handed it to Dr. Dryander,
the chief court preacher, who opened
the principal door into the auditorium.
The imperial party ascended to the
reserved gallery to the music of
Handel's "Hallelujah," Dy the organ
and band.
A simple service then began, the
choir chanting the ninety-fifth Psalm
and the congregation singing the hymn
"To God Alone on High Be Honor."
Dr. Dryander made the dedicatory
address, alluding especially ,to the
presence of Protestant delegates from
other countries and to the message
from the American clergy, which testi
fied to the spiritual unity of the
Protestants throughout the world. Dr.
Dryander suggested that it was the
Emperor's desire that this shall be the
altar of the world of Protestantism and
that the German Emperor shall in a
general sense be the protector of the
faith.

UNGALLANT JUDGE GIVES

MEN GET ONLY A DAY IN JAIL
Little Fete Ends in Imprisonment for
the Hostess and Her Guests.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
It was a strange thing. Mrs. Mar
garet Jackson declared, that a lady
could not give a quiet little evening
party at her home without provoking
police invasion. The unceremonious
manner in which Patrolmen Sheehan
and Nolan broke into her dwelling, a
basement at Folsom and Hawthorne
streets, was uncalled for, she added,
inasmuch as there was no peace dis
turbance by any of the inmates, un
less amicable converse and vocal
music could be so designated. And
as for the arrest of herself and invited
guests â Mrs. Minna Taylor and
Messrs. John Brown, Thomas Phelan
and Frederick Phelan â she doubted
, that police annals anywhere contained
i an outrage to equal it.
Mrs. Taylor also warmly denounced
the conduct of the patrolmen as un
warranted. The disorderly conduct al-
I leged by them, she averred, was pure
;ly imaginary, if not maliciously
trumped up. As the worthy hostess
had already testified, interchange of
1 social gossip and occasionally the
singing of a song was all that could
: have been construed to mean disorder.
I Yes, there was beer, of course, but its
flow was restricted by each of the
': gentlemen playfully protesting when
it came his turn to get the can refilled
:at a nearby saloon. No, sir, nobody
was intoxicated or near to it when the
festivity was interrupted by the men
in uniform. She (Mrs. Taylor) rec
ollected distinctly everything that oc
i curred, which she could not do if the
inebriety alleged by the prosecution
had existed. Who sang? Well, every
body contributed to the melody. Mrs.
j Jackson warbled with much feeling
: "Last Night as I Lay on My Pillow,"
and In response to the insistent demand
by a tearful auditory she interpreted
"My Wild Irish Rose." One of the
gentlemen sang "She Is More to Be
i Pitied Than Censured," and the wit
â¢ ness herself attempted "A Bit of Blar
liney." Any concerted numbers? Sev
eral. Two male voices united in

James Murray, with an artificial leg
and a crimson necktie, was drunk and
very disorderly when Patrolman Riehl
arrested him Saturday evening at Ellis
and Stockton streets. To display his
control of the artificial limb, it was
alleged, Mr. Murray pirouetted upon
its sound companion and held the
bogus member in horizontal position,
thus mowing down persons who
chanced to be within its reach. One
old gentleman ruefully rubbed his
right shin as he protested against the
reckless spinning of Mr. Murray upon
a thronged sidewalk, and by way of
retort and variety of assault Mr. Mur
ray playfully swung an arm and
knocked him down. Judge Mogan
will sentence Mr. Murray for disturb
ing the peace.
"I had a cold, your Honor," said
Mrs. Mary Daly when Judge Cabaniss
asked her why she had been drunk in
a public place.
"And you drank whisky for medi
cinal purposes only, eh?" inquired the
court.
"No, I didn't," was the unlooked
for reply. "I took my quinine in
whisky, and if the doctor hadn't or
dered me to take so much quinine I
wouldn't have taken so much
whisky."
"Good," said his Honor, admiringly.
"Go home now and take your quinine
straight."
Judge Cabaniss said to K. Oheda, a
little brown man who was arrested for
drunkenness and disorderly conduct on
Dupont street:
"I'll fine you $5 and suggest that you
eschew indulgence in American intoxi
cants. Whisky is apparently among
the elements of our civilization that
you Japanese gentlemen find non
assimilable. The records of this court
show that the effect of alcohol on your
temperament is to inspire pugnacity.
If you cannot procure your native tip
pleâwhatever it may be â adopt total
abstinence if you desire to avoid
trouble."
Mrs. Henry J. Romero of 335% Sixth
street was sorry she Instructed a po>
liceman to ; arrest her spouse and book r
him for threatening -her; life, and she j
not only expressed her regret to Judge
Co n , in - open court, . but also - went to
Mr.': Romeros side , and ' spectacularly
lavished ; affection, . : interspersed with
symptoms of remorse, upon him.
\ "Mrs. Harrington was ; at : the bottom i
of it," â¢ Mrs. Romero \ Informed the ;
I Judge, "for she. came and told me that i
I Mr. Romero was paying- attention to
1 other women and that she had heard
I him tell one of them something about |
me that was untrue. ; So when he came j
home I told him I was going to get a
divorce, and then he pulled hiÂ» pistol
! and said he would blow out his brains.
I Whose brains did I say he said? Why
l I said ;he : said he would ,. blow : out his ;
I own brains. No, not mine. That's all
there's to it. It was Mrs. Harrington's 1
tongue- wagging, I tell you, that caused
all the trouble between Henry and me.
and if you let him go I'd like to see j
myself believing what any woman tells i
I me about him after this." |
j Mrs. Harrington was ready to testify ;
' that Mr. Romero had acted and said ,
exactly as she _. represented to Mrs. :
Romero, but the Judge dismissed the '
case and commended Mrs. Romeros ,
resolve to investigate whatever may be j
told her. relative to her husband's mar- j
ital behavior ere she again taxes him
j with infidelity.

There was no tender attachment [
between "Dick" Gray and herself. Miss i
Lulu Emory explained, , although it i
might be regarded as significant that I
she served as' his housekeeper when!
he. became a: widower at Vallejo and'
that now. they' are separate dwellers I
;in a Mason street' lodging-house. As !
for his blackening of her eyes and j
breaking of her coiffure comb, she
could ; assign 'no reason for It other ;
than that ; he - was 'of â¢ malicious and
brutal nature. '
Mr. Gray also alleged platonic re- i
lationship between the complainant '
and himself. He said he did not
blacken her eyes nor break her hair
ornament, despite what she had sworn
to the contrary. She received the :
facial injury accidentally, by falling ;
! against \ a trunk, ; and ' the comb- frac- !
ture he was unable to account for. !
How did she happen to fall? c Well, it '
was in this way: He kept a small
dog, and to afford ; the animal free ;
egress and ingress he made a - hole in ;
the floor- of his chamber. J It was by ,
placing her foot in this holeâ -which i
she probably would not have done if i
she had been perfectly sober â
Miss Emory stumbled and fell against i
his trunk. No, she t had ;no right to i
enter . his | apartment uninvited, * but he â¢
supposed she did Iso because (1) he '
was an old friend of hers and (2) j
because-, ; she was . "soaked," or, in
other words, . J intoxicated. That's all
he knew or cared to know about it.

(liberal) moved an amendment to
the address in reply to the speech
from the throne, demanding denun- ,
ciation of the Brussels sugar conven

Chamberlain defended the convention,
contending that the advance in the
price of sugar is only temporary and ,
not due to the convention, but to a 1

NELSON IS INSTALLED A 10 TO 8 FAVORITE OVER CORBETT
JOHN A. SCOTT SCORES
AT A LENGTHY PRICE
Lorena M, Sporting De la Montanya Colors, Defeats a Shifty Field
of Two-Year-Olds-Andrew Mack Takes Another Purse,
To those who plunged on Sacredus,
the Jennings stable representative in
the concluding Futurity course sprint
* on the card at Oakland yesterday, the
reappearance of John A. Scott will al
ways leave a deep, dark-brown flavor
in the mouth. Not but that the chest
nut horse was not entitled to all he
helped himself to. but it was not gen
erally supposed that the Jones & Lusk
flyer was ready, for his price bumped
along from i until it hit 11. and of
course he threw a natural. Sacredus,
passed along from doorstep to door
step as something that had aged in
the wood since the spring of '74, was
hammered down from 6 to 8 to 5. Seven
minutes was consumed at the post be
fore the barrier was released, and John
A. Scott skimmed away in the lead. He
touched only the high spots and though
limber at the end. Wright kept the
unsuspected one going long enough to
dispose of Squire Johnson by almost a
length. Sacredus ran third, beaten a
head for the place.
Outsiders did well during the entire
sesFion, Lorena M and Revolt getting
home at enticing odds. My Order and
â¢ Andrew Mack were the successful fa
vorites. Fine weather drew a large
attendance.
Lorena M, a 20 to 1 shot, owned by
the wealthy turfman, J. de la Montan
ya, and trained by Jack Curry of har
ness horse fame, took the two-year-old
scramble from a big field. The filly
had shown speed in previous races and
received considerable wise support,
enough to cut the price to 15. McÃride
had her in front entering the stretch
and in a hard drive beat Knapp on the
tardy favorite Chief Wittman a head.
Soledad, the Napa Stock Farm entry,
ran third, nearly a length ahead of
Iron Watson.
Travers must be a pound and sev
eral ounces better than Wright in the
paddle if the improvement shown by
My Order can be taken as any cri
terion. Last Friday, carrying less
weight. Dr. Rowell's 3-year-old was
beaten by Mogregor. Nevertheless My
Order had first call in the betting on
the second number yesterday and won
In jig time from Golden Buck. Mo
gregor ran third, despite the best of
handling. -Â
Besides Toupee, the favorite. Shell
mount and My Surprise, two fresh im
portations from the canning works, fin
ished behind Revolt, a 7 to 1 chance, in
the third. Toupee wore blinkers, and
whether it was the gelding's fault or
Sammy Greenfield's in not getting
away better, is open to speculation. At
any rate Toupee ran fourth, carrying
a good-sized stable commission. Things
looked rosy for My Surprise early
in the game, but he wilted. "Big
Bill" Knapp then picked up the win
ning with Revolt, subduing Shell
mount with a few dollars to blow on
the side. \
It was now in order for Harry Birk
1 enruth to , distinguish himself. The
hoop-legged rider had the mount on
Follow Me m the mile and twenty
yards selling fixture, and lost no time
showing out in the lead. At the close
McÃride led at him very strong on the
belated favorite, George Berry, but he
rode a powerful finish, earning a neck
decision. Away all tangled up, Jack
Little blew in from West Berkeley, se
curing the show.
The fifth act, over a mile and twenty
yards, saw Andrew Mack have the
stage all to himself. Birkenruth was
his support and lent able assistance.
Andrew closed favorite. Turning into 1
the stretch it looked as if Birkenruth ,
had jammed his fist into the sugar
bowl and couldn't withdraw it. While
' waiting to get through, Jakie Jones,
astride the pacemaker, Budd Wade, [
pulled in close to the rail and Larsen
on Mindanao, the second choice, lay
over just enough to place the favorite
in a pretty . pocket. , But Birkenruth
â  Â£t)t through at the paddock, and in a
drive downed Mindanao a head. k

BERKELEY'S ROWING COACH
TAKES CHARGE OF CREW
E. M. Garnett Arrives and Makes
Ready to Get Oarsmen Into
Shaj>e.
BERKELEY, Feb. 27.â E. M. Gar
nett, the new boating: coach from
Harvard, engaged by the executive
committee of the Associated Students
to direct the varsity crew in its prep
arations to meet Stanford, held his
first conference with the candidates
for places on the crew this afternoon
In response to a call nearly seventy
five men of the university gathered
at the gymnasium to meet Garnett
The new coach made an address, in
forming the men that it would be im
practicable to maintain a training ta
ble, but that all the candidates would
be "on honor," and he would expect
each man to abstain from dissipation
or indulgence In food or drink that
would not be for his best good as a
rowing man.
Garnett will begin to-morrow to
deal with the men on the estuary and
in actual practice will explain the
stroke which the varsity is to use
against Stanford. He encouraged the
men by declaring, in his belief, row
ing might soon be developed into a
sport of such importance at the uni
versity that a crew might be made up
to go East and compete In an annual
regatta with the best varsity crews on
Lake Champlain or elsewhere.
Farmers speak of the "off" and
"near" horse. Do you know which is

BACKERS OF NELSON THINK
HE WILL WIN AGAIN.
RIVAL BOXERS READY TO
EXCHANGE BLOWS TO-NIGHT
The eve of the great battle finds
Young Corbett and Battling Nelson
ready and willing. Training practically
came to an end at the camps of the
rival boxers yesterday afternoon and
now both of them are waiting for the
gong to sound the warning that the
moment of battle is at hand. The bet
ting was brisk yesterday and the odds
were 10 to 8 in favor of the doughty
Dane.
Interest is rife as to the outcome of
the mill. In fact, the whole town was
talking fight last night. From all ac
counts there will be a full house at
Woodward's Pavilion to-night when
the husky featherweights clash. The
advance sale of seats has been unusu
ally large and Manager Morris Levy
of the Hayes Valley Club figures on a
$15,000 house at the lowest calculation.
Nelson ruled a steady favorite with
the bettors all day yesterday. He
opened at 10 to 8 in the morning and
the price never changed. At that there
was plenty of Corbett money in sight,
showing that the little man from Den
ver town has not lost any of his popu
larity even if Nelson did lord it over
him a few weeks ago.
Both boxers will leave the sunny
shores of Marin County this afternoon
and rest in this city till the hour of
weighing in arrives. This will take
place at 6 o'clock at Harry Corbetts.
The weight is not troubling either lad,
as both are down to the required
notch or within a fraction of a pound
of it.
The fight promises to be one gruel
ing affair. It does not look like a
twenty-round mill, though no one can
tell till the lads get to mixing it. Both
are sure to go to the conflict in slam
bang style and Referee Jack Welch
figures on having a merry old time of
it in the ring when the pair get to
gether.
Nelson will have his manager, Billy
Nolan, Fred Landers and some other
handler of pugs in his corner when the
going begins. Corbett will be looked
after by Joe (Jans, Frank McDonald
and probably Tim McGrath.
Yesterday was a quiet one at the
training camps at San Rafael and
Larkspur compared with the strenu
ous work which both have Indulged in
during the past months. Corbett arose
early in the morning and after a light
breakfast he took his usual run with
Joe Gans. He napped after lunch and
then he and Gans took a short walk.
After a rub down the little Denverite
gave out his weight at 130V 2 pounds.
To-mo'TO\v morning when he arises he
will be a trifle underweight. A quiet
day will be spent to-morrow, only a
short walk being indulged in. Corbett
will leave San Rafael on an afternoon
train arriving at San Francisco in time
to weigh in. He will then repair to a
hotel and wait until the time arrives
for him to appear at the pavilion.

RIVAL FEATHER-WEIGHTS WHO
WILL MEET IN RING AT WOOD
WARDS PAVILION TO-NIGHT.
Battling Nelson at Larkspur took a
ten-mile run on the road in the morn
ing and in the afternoon he took a
short walk.
Gymnasium work was entirely dis
pensed with to avoid any danger of
him injuring his hands. The Dane is
well down to weight, touching the
beam at about 130% pounds. He will
take a short run to-morrow and leave
Larkspur in time to be at Harry Cor
bett's at 6 p. m. to weigh in.
Nelson says: 'I am feeling as well
as I ever felt in my life and while I
have had some trouble making the
weight I don't feel any weak effects
from it. If I am beaten by Corbett I
will not offer that as an excuse. I know
I will have a harder battle with Cor
bett than before, but I will get the
money before the twentieth round.
"If successful with Corbett I want
Jimmie Britt. My forfeit has been
posted with Harry Corbett for some
time, but Britt has failed to show the
color of his money."
Corbett says: "As every one knows
I have trained long and faithfully for
my coming battle with Nelson, and I
never was in better condition in my
life. Marin County is an ideal place
to train and making the weight has
been easy.
"I know Nelson is a tough one, but I
expect to get the verdict by the knock
out route. My other fight Bhould not
be counted, as I was out of condition.
"I owe much to Frank McDonald and
Joe Gans, who have prepared me for
this fight and I could not be in better
shape."

HEAVYWEIGHTS CARDED
TO FIGHT NEXT MONTH
Greggains Obtains Permit and Puts
Up Hart and Jack Johnson.
A mild surprise was sprung in the
sporting world yesterday afternoon
when the Police Committee of the
Board of Supervisors awarded the
March fight permit to Alex Greggaina,
manager of the San Francisco Athletic
Club. Jimmy Coffroth, the Yosemite
magnate, was hot after the concession,
but the forces against him proved too
strong and he lost out.
As soon as Greggains secured the
covettd permit, he announced that he
had matched Jack Johnson, the
champion colored heavyweight, with
Marvin Hart. Greggains figures that
the winner of this bout will be pitted
against Jeffries, but the sporting pub
lic in general is rather doubtful of this
fact.
Greggains was a happy man when
he learned thrt the permit was his.
A bitter fight had been waging for the
paper for several weeks and most of
the knowing ones figured that Coffroth
was due to receive it. Coffroth said
last night that he felt neither sore nor
disappointed at the outcome. He was
almost certain up to a few days ago

BAY CITIES ATHLETES OPEN'
INDOOR TRIALS OF SKILL
Last night witnessed the opening of
the Indoor athletic championship
meet of- the athletes from the bay
cities of California In the gymnasium
of the Young Men's Christian Associa
tion. Three remaining nights will
complete the schedule of the meet.
These will take place on March 1 2
and 3.
The large gymnasium was filled
with enthusiasts and the occasion was
enlivened by the Columbia Park Band.
The events consisted of wrestling, rope
climbing, races, vaulting. Jumping and
fancy exercises on the parallel bars.
The swing of Indian clubs and torches
by the Columbia Park boys was a
feature of the evening.
The following programme was
given :
Columbia Park Band, selections; wrestlincâ
George Piper (Y. M. C. A.) vs. Ernil Tschuml
(Olympl- nub); W. R. MeCullough <Y. M (
A.) vs. G. J. Anloff (Reliance Athletic Club)
rope climb, quarter- mile potato? race' polÂ«
vault; parallel bar exercises; Indian clubs and
torches, Columbia Park boys.
that the permit would be his, but n
unlooked for hitch came in the pr< -
gramme at the last moment and th-
Yosemite manager was nosed out
the prize.
This means that Jimmy Britt w
not me^t the winner of the Nelson-
Corbett mixup. Many of the sporting
fraternity were looking forward lo
this conflict, but now they will be
doomed to bitter duappaintment.
Greggains did not figure on the
featherweights for some reason, as he
immediately began tp t ilk business
with H irt and Johnson.
Coffrothr has the signed contracts of
both Nelson and Corbett for 1 match
with Britt. He also told th^ir man
agers he would post a $1500 forfeit
to Dull the fight off in March. This
money has not as yet been deposited
by Coffroth, but he says he will ; it
at all events. It is not likely that
either manager will take the money.
It now looks as though the winner
of the Xelson-Oorbett battle will meet
Jimmy Britt in April. If everything
goes right. Coffroth will get the per
mlt for that month and he would lik*
to see the rival featherweights mix it.
DISCUSS PLANS
FOR BIG SHOW
Sportsmen Interested in
the Coming Exhibition
Exchange Their Views
The most important meeting â¢ Â«ver
held by the Pacific Coaat Forest, Fish
and Game Association was the result
of a lunch given by William Greer
Harrison at the Olympic Club yester
day. All of the committee chairmen
were invited and fourteen sat at
the round table in a special dining
room. The keynote of the whole affair
may be summed up in a resolution put
by the president-host to the effect that
no matter what difficulties might block
the way the show was to be given, and
given successfully.
It was a business meeting coupled
with a social gathering. Ideas were ex
changed between courses, and at th
close of the menu President Harrison
announced that J. Downey Harvey had
undertaken the task of guiding th
finance committee with the iaea of
adding JSOOO to the working capit i
the big show.
Every one had an original thuun'
help the coming exhibition along,
of the best features suggested was ri
practical illustration of the wireless
telegTaph. using the ots trcÂ«s* or thÂ«
miniature forest as transmitters and
conductors. The plan was adopt -Â« 1
unanimously. Walter D. Mansfield
showed how he could conduct a rty
casting tournament with profit to the
association - Aiken proposed to
gather into the fmd Dr. Filben's collec
tion of marine fauna; another member
suggested that Luther Burbank b^
asked to make an exhibit of his marvel
ous progress in developing the plant
life of the State, and so on down
through the list each man present gave
an Idea that will be acted upon to
make the whole affair instructive as
well as beautiful. Business men who
came for an hour, only, stayed th re
times that long, and the president's
luncheon turned out to be a pleasant
break in the monotony of the severe
business meetings and -erved a double
purpose.
Ot'NTHKR SECOND TRIAL, SET.â The

Board Accepts Bids of Vari

Amounting to $1,703,20(1
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
adopted a resolution pledging itself to
give or lease at a nominal rental to
the State a site for the new State Nor
mal School, or as an alternative to do
nate the sum of $50,000 to the appro
priation of $150,000 made for the pur
pose by the Legislature, providing,
however, that either proposition can
be legally carried out.
A copy of the resolution was ordered
transmitted to the President of the
State Senate, the Speaker of the House
and the Governor. Dr. F. Burk, presi
dent Â«â¢Â£ the Normal School Trustees,
thanked the board for its action, say
ing that he felt sure the Governor
would sign the bill for the $150,000 ap
propriation.
The board accepted the bids of vari
ous banks and of the State Board of
Examiners for a portion of the munici
pal bond issue as follows: School
bonds, 5650,600; sewer bonds, $281,200;
street bonds, $243,000; jail bonds,
5278.400: hospital bonds. $250,000; total.
$1,703,200.
The board took no action relative to
the payment of the demands of F. M.
Yorke & Co. for repairs to bituminous
pavements during August and Sep
tember. The Finance Committee had a
form of receipt prepared reciting
that neither the city nor the Yorke
Company waived any of its right? in
the matter of a settlement. The
amount to be paid was not decided
upon by the committee, but will prob
ably he fixed next Monday.
The claim of the Citizens' Alliance
for damages sustained during the re
cent hackmen's strike was denied.
The roadways of Broderkk street
between Broadway and Vallejo, Her

L,aguna, Baker street between Golden
Gate avenue and Turk. Laguna street
between Waller and Hermann. Her
mann street between Laguna and

Hermann a.id Market, were fully ac
cepted.
The Federation of Mission Clubs sent
c 'communication to the board calling
attention to the fact that out of the
$2000 allowed for work on Corbett av
enue nothing has been done on the av
enue south of Twentieth street, where
repairs are badly needed; also that $924
has been drawn out of the $5000 ap
propriation for work on San Bruno
road, although no work has been done
since last July. An investigation is
desired by the organization so that no
illegal payments may be made out of
the fund.
The Board of Works recommended
the repairing of Market street from
East street westerly out of the pro

ices.
Dr. E. MoClifih. president of the Uni
versity of the Pac inc. spoke yesterday
before the Methodist Ministers' Asso
ciation, his subject being "Our Educa
tional Problems."
Dr. McClish said that the first prob
lem was that of the name "University,"
and while he conceded that they sub
jected themselves to criticism for tak
ing the name "University" when they
did "college work" he did not deem it
â¢-ss^ntial to insist upon a change to
that of "College" while the term in
general usage was not clearly differen
tiated.
He said that out of the 480 institu
tions of higher learning mentioned in
the report of the Commissioner of
Education, 155 passed under the name
"University," and the University of the
Pacific was among that number.
WOULD NOT DISCOURAGE.
The second problem was the reduc
tion of the university to an academy or
junior college. It did not seem wise to
Dr. McClish to take a step that might
result in permanent degradation of the
status of the university, and in view
of the fact that such a step would dis
courage many of the friends and alum
ni of the institution.
Dr. McClish said that the third prob
lem was that of entering into such an
adjustment with the State University
under new regulations of the State
Board of Education as would secure
for the graduates of the University
of the Pacific certification to teach in
the high schools of the State. This
important step Dr. McClish thought
might be accomplished in the not re
mote future.
The discussion that followed showed
a marked interest both in the "small
college" and the University of the Pa
cific.
Preparations for the big convention
of the Christian church in August
next were in progress yesterday morn
ing and evening. The Rev. Walter M.
White. D. D., the Rev. P. C. Macfar
lane, the Rev. Mr. Boyer, the Rev.
Frank P. Ford and others took an en
thusiastic part in the discussions.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1905.
CENTRAL AMERICANS ARE TOO BUSY WITH
COFFEE CROP TO STIR UP REVOLUTIONS
Steamship San Jose Arrives From Panama
Tourists From New
York Are Among
Passengers,
The Pacific Mall Company's San Jose,
Captain H. Thompson, arrived early
yesterday morning after an uneventful
passage from Panama and way ports.
In earn of the Central American re
publics at which the San Jose called
the white bird of peace is still sweetly
cooing. Everybody is too busy gath
ering and marketing an extra big cof
fee crop, say the San Jose's officers,
to indulge In any revolutionary pas
time. When the last bean has been
shipped away and the coffee kings
have closed their accounts for the sea
son -there will come a period of idle
ness during which hard-earned dollars
will disappear with little effort. When
the majority of the people in the rev
olution zone are "broke" the time will
be ripe for an Insurrection, but just
where the first outbreak will be, trav
elers from the South have different
opinions.
As far as they could judge by what
they saw and heard at San Jose the
officers say internal affairs in Guate
mala seem to be more settled now
than they have appeared for some
time. The Guatemalan officials are
worrying more, they say, about trou
ble from the outside, inspired by the
holders of Guatemalan securities.
Several weeks ago the Guatemalan
Consul here confided to Customs Col
lector Stratton his suspicions that con
traband of war was being shipped
from this harbor to ajd the revolu
tionists in that country. Mr. Stratton
laid the matter before the Department
of Commerce and Labor at Washing
ton and yesterday came a letter from
Secretary Hay assuring the Collector
that the State Department was' ready
at all times to act upon tangible infor
mation.
The San Jose's passengers were near
ly all from New York, most of those
in the cabin being tourists, who pre
ferred ocean travel to the dust and
discomfort of the overland journey.
The liner brought 1287 tons of cargo
and treasure valued at $10,800. Her
passengers included the following:
S. Lm. Moore, Mrs. S. L. Moore, -Miss H.
Armstrong, F. Barrios. & Wolf, James T.
Rook, Mrs. James T. Rook Mrs. G. L. Spen
cer, H. Tomme, Dr. H. K. Beatty. Mrs. H. K.

Danger to Coasting Vessels.
The steamer Eureka, Captain Andrew Hall,
which arrived Friday from Ladysmith, report
ed to the Merchants" Exchange that on Feb
ruary 24, about twenty miles north we6t of
Point Reyes she passed a derelict, which ap
peared to be a piledrlver. According to the
officers of the Eureka the derelict was large
and heavily built and a menace to navigation.
Travel alons this coast is very heavy and In
the shipping community surprise was ex
pressed yeEterday that no steps had been taken
liy the authorities to find and destroy the der
elict reported three days ago by the Eureka.
On the Atlantic coast the revenue cutter
service finds in work of this kind the principal
excuse for its longer existence. It is different
here, , and yesterday there were many com
ments on the fact that while the derelict pile
driver is wandering along in the track of
crowded passenger steamers the revenue cut
tfr Hugh McCulloch, officered and manned,
and supposed to be ready for sea at short no
tice. Is swinging idly among the yachts at
Sautalito.
Springs a ljcak at Sea.
The schooner Orient, Captain Saunderp,
which lert here February 21 for Grays Har
bnr. returned yesterday on account of a leak.
The leak was discovered on Friday when the
schooner was ICO miles to the westward of
this port. When she arrived yesterday the
water was coming in through hor seams at
the rate of four inches an hour.

Brnsted Renews Offenses.
J. Frederick Bensted, the English
remittance man, who was arrested a
month ago for annoying the members
of Grace Episcopal Church, was ar
rested again yesterday on complaint of
Prank P. Le Count for the same of
fense. Bensted seems to have an in-
Sane infatuation for Miss Susie Le
Count and has written several letters
to her, denouncing Rev. David Evans,
of Grace Church, Miss Le Count's
fiance. He was warned when arrested
the first time to keep away from Grace-
Church and not to correspond with
any of its members. Despite his prom
ises, Frank P. Le Count declares, he
has renewed the offenses. Bensted is
held at the detention ward of the Cen
tral Emergency Hospital and will be
examined by the Insanity Commission
ers.

KEARNEY'S FAME
STILL LINGERS
Commissioner North Asks a
Chinese Youth as to His
Knowledge of the Agitator
TWO-YEAR-OLD MEMORY
Geography, Topography and
Other Sciences Required
Before Granting Admission
The Chinese boy who is born in the
United States and taken at an early
age to China by his parents has a dif
ficult task before him when he seeks
readmission to the land of his birth.
He is supposed by the Chinese Bureau
at this port to have kept himself In
formed during his absence of all that
happens politically in his birthplace
and to acquaint himself with the geog
raphy, topography, geology and
meteorology of every part of the
United States that he may have lived
in or passed through. Should he be
found lacking in any of these im
portant particulars admission to the
country ia denied him.
Yee Sang May recently went through
this experience and has obtained from
the United States District Court a writ
o"! habeas corpus. The records of the
Chinese Bureau show that Yee is 25
years old: that he was born in this
city and taken by his parents to El
Paso, Tex., when he was 2 years old,
thence to China two years later. On
his return two months ago he was in
terrogated by United States Immigrant
Commissioner Hart North as follows:
"Did you ever hear of Dennis
Kearney?"
"No," was the reply. This answer
caused a black mark to be entered
against his name.
"Are there any mountains near El
Paso?" ,
"I don't know."
"Is it a fertile country or a moun
tainous country?"
â¢"I don't know."
"How old were you when you first
saw your father and mother?"
"I saw them as soon as I was able
to see at all."
"How old was your mother when
she married your father?"
"I don't know."
For such incomprehensible ignor
ance Commissioner North denied him
a landing.
BAEHR TAKES NO ACTlON. âAuditor
Baehr took no action yesterday relative to the
Mayor's threat to remove him unless !ie repay
to tha city the amounts of audited demands
for Grand Jury expenses under penalty of re
moval. Baehr said he desired to consult with
his attorney as to what steps. If any, to taka
regarding the Mayor's ultimatum.

THE SAN FRAN CISCO CALL
JOHN D. SPRECKELS Proprietor
ADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO
JOHN McNArGHT â¢ â¢ Manager
PIBU'.ATTON OFFICB -THIRD AND MARKET STREETS, SAN FRANCISCO
TUESDAY FEBRUARY 28. 1905
THE SUTTER STREET TROLLEY.
THE cable road was not only an improvement on the previous
method of surface transportation, but it was a suggestion of a
greater improvement to follow. When it was invented in San
Francisco and n>st put in operation here, it was the forerunner of
what was to be accomplished by the use of electricity as a motive
power. When the first cable car made its initial trip, electricity had
not passed out of the stage of laboratory experiment. Now it has
gone far beyond the laboratory, and is a practical motor in use for
any purpose that requires power. But as an agent in a street car sys
tem it had to go through an experimental stage. This was the over-.
head era, for power wires, and is everywhere passing away. In ele
vated roads the trolley wire overhead has been replaced by the third
rail. This cannot be used on the street surface because it is danger
ous, and on surface roads the overhead wire is being disused by the
underground conduit. The advantages of this are so obvious that it
is strange that any street railroad company is found to resist its use.
In Washington City the street railroads were formerly a mixed
system of horse and cable power, principally the latter. The com
pany would not change to electricity. One night the power-house,
south of Pennsylvania avenue, near Fourteenth street, took fire and
was entirely destroyed. When the alarm rang and the location of the
fire was identified the stockholders went to bed feeling poor. When
they awoke in the morning there was a reversal, for their stock had
advanced in value more than 25 per cent because the destruction of
the power-house made it certain that the system would be changed
from cable to electricity. This change followed, and taking the be
low ground cable conduit a* a suggestion, the company put in an un
derground electric system, upon which all of the lines in the na
tional capital are now operated. The streets are not disfigured by
poles, nor made unsafe and unsightly by overhead wires. The com
pany has no utt for an army of employes to attend to the poles and
wires. All risk to life is removed by having no high power wires to
break and cross low power wires, or to fall in the street and kill
horses and human beings.
In some cities street railway companies refuse to change to an
underground system under pretense of waiting for the invention of a
storage battery, that will make each car independently enabling it to
earn- its own power. Rut such a storage battery has not yet ap
peared, and to wait for it is like continuing the old horse car till
such time as the battery appears.
This issue is in focus now in San Francisco. The Sutter Street
Improvement Club wants the line on that street to give a better serv
ice, and this cannot be given with the existing cable. The road
must be changed to an electric line. The people want an under
ground trolley. The United Railroads demands the right to erect
an overhead trolley system, to which the people properly and firmly
object. There is no obstacle in the way of an underground system.
That method is in operation in Vienna. Rrussels. New York. Wash
ington. Thicago and other large Eastern and European cities. San
Francisco is not a village and will not submit to village conditions
of surface transportation. Experience elsewhere proves beyond dis
pute that while the underground system costs more at first, the
economy of its operation returns the excess to the corporation. All
lightened railway managers, of all kinds of roads, recognize it as
the wisest of economy to make large expenditures to be offset by
economy in operation. The Southern Pacific Railway was moved by
that consideration in building the very costly Lucin cutoff to avoid
the climbing of Promontory Point. The improvement cost millions,
-but every dollar will finally come back, with interest, and when it
all repaid, the economy of operation will appear in the form of
profit to the stockholders. Exactly the same is true of underground
electric power for operating street railroads.
The United Railroads in its answer to the petition of the Im
provement Club and other citizens does not come up to the expecta
tions of San Francisco. It refers to the improvements it has made
in our transportation facilities, and all that it says in that respect is
true. Rut those very improvements led our citizens to believe that it
was a modern, up-to-date corporation, which knew that the very best
facilities and methods were deserved by San Francisco and were, in
the long run. the most profitable for itself.
The corporation does not fulfill the expectations of the people
in this insistence upon methods that are already antiquated and ob
solete in every progressive city in the United States. It has disap
pointed its friends and placed itself in a false position which it .will
hasten to abandon if it consult its best interests. The tendency in
all cities is toward putting all electric wires underground. In Oak
land a time limit has already been fixed for that process. In Eastern
cities the enormous increase in street poles and overhead wires, and
the increasing danger caused by the use of high power wires! has
stimulated everywhere the movement to force all electric wires un
derground. This will have to be. The result is inevitable. Cor
porations may halt and palter and parley about the cost and the in
convenience to them of the change, but the public welfare demands
that it be made and it will come.
The peoole along the Sutter street line and the Board of Super
visors should stand firmly by their contention, and the United Rail
roads should put itself abreast of the times by receding from its po
sition. Corporations are not like individuals 'in possessing the pride
of opinion. They exist by favor of the public and get their profits
from its patronage. They thrive on the friendly feeling of the people
and they are injured when they lose it.
We are persuaded that the people of this city are willing to fcivc
any reasonable privilege to the United Railroads, but this depends
upon the attitude of the corporation toward the people. Its mani
festo on the overhead trolley is a tactical mistake of the most
serious character, which should be receded from at once. Such re
cession is perfectly easy, as such mistakes occur through the zeal of
those who do not make, but merely administer, the policy of the
corporation.' r J
BROOKLYN'S BAKER.
FOR some inscrutable reason a Brooklyn district is represented
in Congress by Mr. Robert Baker, who publishes an official
biography in the Congressional Directory that occupies more
than a page. He tells of his achievements in the same vein in which
Mr. Hearst records his in his own newspapers.
This remarkable Mr. Baker desires that the House expel him for
introducing a resolution censuring the President for sending formal
condolence for the assassination of Grand Duke Sergius. Mr Baker
was very vehement against the President for this and roared and
raved until some of his Democratic colleagues sat down on him and
he was extinguished.
What a< Government we would have if it were run by the
Bakers-! In its externalities the United States is a sovereignty, one
of the. family of nations. It is neither republican nor monarchal
nor autocratic. With its domestic system other sovereignties have
nothing to do, and it has nothing to do with their domestic govern
ment. In the family of nations all stand alike. When events es
peaally death, and especially death by violence, affect one sovereign
ty, immemorial custom sanctions the expression of condolence by the
others It makes no differ-nce whether the Czar's uncle were an
imp of darkness, or an angel of light, condolence was in accord with
the etiquette of nations.
But this remarkable and bawling Baker of Brooklyn proceeded
to annoy the House by assuming that such formal condolence was
evidence that President Roosevelt is in sympathy with the auto
cratic system of the Russian Government. To expel Baker would
dignify him too much. He should be cracked by a thumb nail
President Roosevelt is more likely to get satisfaction than is the Senate
for he can take Jt out of the next professor of boxing that visits the White
House.â Milwaukee Sentinel

don't you think it's about time . you
I made a choice from the field?"
"I don't quite follow you," shi said.
"Don't you think it's time you let
the one and only man know his happy
fate?" he suggested. ".Let's see, how
many are there, anywayâ the really
eligible ones, you know?"
Philllda regarded him with a little
frown of disapproval for a moment,
but it presently gave place to a win
ning smile.
I - "Your impertinence does you credit,
j I must say," she observed. "But since
you seem to be so much interested in
' the matter, I'll place the estimate
i roughly at six."
"Six," he mused thoughtfully. "In
\ eluding me, Phillida?"
* "Including you, of course," she said.
j "Your unremitting attentions for the
; past four years have won you a place
on the list, Teddy."
"You should make a choice," he said
gravely. "Tempus has a way of
fugiting, and patience ceases to be a
virtue even with a man in love,"
"You merely -state your views in the
| matter," said' she.
"I fancy I voice the sentiments of the
i field," he remarked. \
"It's a -very grave matter," she said
mockingly; "one requiring time."
"You've taken time enough already
to make a score of chonsings," said
| he. "Now, really, I want to help you
|in the matter, r don't want to see
| you delay until all your suitors are
; married or dead."
"Thanks." said she. "Your adclce
will be Invaluable. Now, knowing
these men quite as well as I do, which
one* would you suggest as the most
suitable husband?"
Grozier held up a deprecating hand.
"Excessive modesty forbids me to
state, madam," said he. â¢
I'hilltdd laughed gayly.
"You wear your excessive modesty
awkwardly. Evidently it's new," she
asserted.
"It seems to me," said Grozier,
wrinkling his brow thoughtfully, "that
the best method to reach the desired
result is by a process of elimination.
Lief s take them in order. Now young
Cartwright first; he's a fine chap, an
exceptionally fine chap; but he has no
money. Isn't that so, Phillida?"
She nodded.
"Exit Mr. Cartwright," said he.
"Now let's take a look, at Garrison.
Mighty fine fellow, this Garrison, but
a trifle too sportive of tendency. You
wouldn't want to marry a man who
follows every ring contest and plays
the races heavily, would you?"
"Nâ o," she said slowly. "Still Mr.
Garrisonâ" - ~ ' '
"Exit Mr. Garrison." he went on
hastily. "Porter next. The only thing
against poor old Porter is his age.
Money â barrels of it, and steady as
an eightday clock, but old undenia
bly old. He's getting rather bald and
about the temples he's decidedly gray.
Age is a very great disadvantage in
a suitor, don't you think so?"..
"Possibly," she said doubtfully.
"Good-by, Mr. Porter," said he.
"We have duly considered your prop
osition and find at present we are In
no position to take it up. Now then
for Dracut."
FASHION'S MIRROR
A smart, dressy frock of light gray nun's veiling, trimmed
zinth shirring of gray silk and bands of white lace insertion.
The girdle is of folded white silk, fastening behind with a
targe pearl buckle.
"Do you Intend toâer-^
abide by the result?"
"He's not on the list," she said de
murely.
"Well, Brownlow, then. Brownlow
is lacking in tact. He says the wrong
thing tn the right place and vice
versa. Wouldn't you be apt to find
yourself making continual excuses for
him?"
"Very probably," she admitted.
"Next we'll take Partridge and Cov
ington jointly. Too youngâ alas! too
young! People would say you were
robbing the cradle. You must make
some concession to public opinion,
you know."
Phillida was silent. A mocking
smile curved the corners of her mouth.
"Well," said he, "I'm the only one
left."
'â¢Lot me hear of your fallings," she
said.
"I haven't any." he replied meekly.
"Save excessive modCsty," she
prompted.
"But if you'd like me better with a
few trivial faults I'll try to cultivate
some," he said hopefully.
"Your method of elimination is
very impressive," she observed.
"I hope so," said he. "Do you in
tend toâ erâ abide by the result, Phil
lida?"
She looked at him archly and broke
into a peal of merry laughter.
"Teddy, you dear, stupid boy," she
said, "there never has been but one
really eligible man on the list, and
he, through excessive modesty, I pre
sume, has never broached the sub
ject."
"Then you do abide by the result?"
h<"> asked.
"All the others were eliminated
long ago without your help," she said
softly.â (Copyright, 1905, by T. C. Mc-

WORLD'S COAL AND IRON
It is? stated in a scientific journal
of recent date that the United States,
Croat Britain and Germany together
produce approximately 80 per cent of
the coal and iron of the world; and if
the industrial importance of the ma
terials be considered the supreme test,
these countries would necessarily he
adjudged the leading mining countries
of to-day. Their pre-eminence would
probably be even more marked if
complete statistics coverirjfc the pro
duction of cement, clay, stone and
other nonmetallic resources were
available.
FACTS
ABOUT
COLDS
The common theory that all colds
are the result of exposure of some sort
is a great mistake. Exposure is not
the direct cause of the disease. Scien
tists tell us that colds are caused by
a hostile microbe, which gains a foot
hold when our vitality is lowered by
exposure, and that if we inure our
selves to exposure we have an effec
tive remedy against the microbe of
cold,' as well as many others. There
are many evidences to prove this
theory. There are many places
where it is impossible to catch cold,
because there is no cold to catch. We
have not yet forgotten that Nansen
and his men, during the three years
they spent in the Arctic regions,
were immune from cold, though they
were constantly enduring exposure
of every kind. They passed day after
day in clothes so saturated with per
spiration that by day they froze into a
solid mass, so that they cut into the
flesh. And at night, in their sleeping
bags the first hour was spent in thaw
ing out. They returned to civilization
none the worse in health, but soon
contracted severe colds u)pon reach
ing there.
Then there is the remarkable in
stance of St. Kilda, that lonely, rocky
island, which was visited by Dr. John
son when he and Boswell were mak
ing their famous tour of the Hebrides.
There are about one hundred inhabi
tants on the island. The coasts are
so precipitous that for eight months
in the year it is practically inacces
sible. Several vessels from the main
land call there during the summer.
And, strange to say, whenever a ship
reaches the island from the mainland
every inhabitant, even to the infants,
are seized with colds. This fact has
been known for more than two hun
dred years, and was of great interest
to Dr. Johnson, who was skeptical
concerning it.
The question of this St. Kilda cold
long puzzled men, who never dreamed
that it was an infectious disease and
that without the possibility of infec
tion it is impossible to catph it, no
matter what the exposure may be.
That is to say, it is due to a micro
organism, and without the presence of
this micro-organism the disease can
not be contracted.

The Smart Set
SALLY SHARP
That Buckley-Thunder wedding
came as a shock to the set in which
the clever young woman moved. It
was suspected that Mr. Thunder was
mightily interested in one of Dr. C. F.
Buckley's daughters, but until very
lately the true state of affairs was not
revealed. And now the whole inter
esting story's out.
Quietly the coy pair were wedded at
noon yesterday at St. Mary's Cathe
dral, Just over the way from the Hotel
Baltimore, the home of the bride, with
a few relatives who had been let into
the secret as witnesses. Although the
wedding was celebrated without the
usual embellishments of society nup
tials, few brides have looked fairer
than she in her smart gown and hat
of pale blue.
Mr. Thunder is a local business man,
who had the good fortune to meet
Miss Buckley abroad. These meetings
of San Franciscans abroad usually do
produce results.
After a brief pest-nuptial trip Mr.
and Mrs. Thunder will take apart
ments at the Colonial.

THE PROPOSED BUILDING AND LOAN
ASSOCIATION BILL.
To the Editor of The Call:
I consider the bill proposed by the
joint committee on building and loan
associations simply infamous. If it
were found to be legal, which I doubt
very much, it would destroy all the
meritorious, honest local building and
loan associations in the State and
build up a system of get-rich-quick
affaLrs which promise heaven and
earth and give little or nothing.
I cannot conceive how five members
of the Legislature should have been
so hoodwinked by designing sch^rnefs
to propose such new law regulating
building and loan associations. In,
plain language it simply encourages
the dishonest and abolishes the hon
est building and loan associations.
EVen the only poor! nrti<-lÂ»Â» in the bill,
which was proposed jy eie local
building and loan associations, "that
all members of butlding and loan as
sociations upon withdrawal at any
time should receive at least the full
amount paid into such association."
seems to have been juggled out of the
bill. â¢
This leaves it in the hands of dis
honest associations to pay their re
tiring members little or nothing as
they please upon the withdrawal of
their members. There are "many thou
sands of people in this State who have
lost a portion of the money which
they have invested in dishonest build
ing and loan associations who will
join me in condemning this dishonest
practice.

I do not he'ieve that the Legisla
ture will pass this bill and if it should
I do not believe that the Governor
will sign it. The honest building and
loan associations in California have
helped thousands of people to pro
cure homes for their families on pay
men' of small jnonthly installments
who to-rlay without the aid of such
associations would not have a shingle
over their heads. They have, in ad
dition, induced many thousands of
wage earners tr> save part of their
monthly salaries and thus build a
foundation for future Independence.
Our State requires such a merito
rious institution v> help build our
sparsely settled State, both in the city
and in the country, and I cannot con
oeive how any sane person can ap
prove of the destruction of such truly
meritorious institutions.
I know whereof I speak, having
been continuously connected with the
local building and loan associations
since 1675 and being the oldest
building: and loan association secre
tary in the State of California.
The present bunding and loan asso
ciation laws require to be amended so
as to give full protection to stockhold
ers, but the bill proposed, \rhile .it
revolutionizes th<Â» whole building and
loan association system. In Its present
state does a great deal more harm
than good to the very people for
whom it is intended to safely protect
their investment.

DEATH CLAIMS
AGED CHAMPION
OF ABOLITION
GROTON, Mass., Feb. 27. â After an
illness of a few days George S. Bout
well, former Governor of Massachu
setts and former United States Secre
tary of the Treasury, died at his home
here to-day, aged 87 years. He was
stricken with pneumonia last Friday,
and owing to his extreme age was
unable to rally.
For more Chan sixty years Boutwell
has been in public .life, beginning his
career as a lecturer at the age of 19.
At 2 4 he was elected to the Massa
chusetts Legislature and at 3 3 he was
chosen Governor of the State. Al
though elected to these offices as a
Democrat, Boutwell became active in
the organization of the Republican
party. He was a personal friend or
President Lincoln.
Boutwell was an outspoken aboli
tionist. He served in the National
Housp of Representatives from 1862
to 1868 inclusive, and was a member
of the commission which reported the
fourteenth amendment and conducted
the debate in the House. He was
Secretary of the Treasury in Presi
dent Grant's first Cabinet. In 1878
Boutwell was elected to the United
States Senate, where he served for
six years. Boutwell was among the
most prominent opponents of the
Spanish war. In fact so strong was
his conviction that after war was de
clared he left the Republican party
and with the formation of the Anti-
Imperialist League became its presi
dent, which office he held at the time
of h"B death.
Boutwell was the author of books
on politics and finances.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1905.
PRIEST PLEADS
HIS PRIVILEGE
Father Calzia Declines to
Say Whether or Not
He Was Yoell's Confessor
PIONEERS ON STAND
Old-Timers Express Opinion
That Dead Lawyer Was
Unsound in His Mind
The proponents In the Yoell will
contest are digging into the past and
following up the lead for proof of
James Alexander Yoell's mental com
petency from pioneer days until the
time of his death. The witnesses call
ed by Mr. Delmas yesterday were
nothing if not impressive.
After Mr. Hoefler, for the contest
ants, had finished tangling Mrs. Mary
A- Welch Scully, who did not remem
ber the financial transactions of her
husband, except that she paid Scully's
debts and believed John Yoell had
robbed her, the proponents went on
with their case.
Father Bartholomew Calzia, former
ly of the college at San Jose, where he
was paxiÃh priest, but now of St.
Ignatius Church in this city, told of
his long acquaintance with Yoell and
his belief in the soundness of the old
lawyer's mind. Mr. Hoefler, on cross
examination, asked the priest whether
he was ever Yoell's confessor. Father
Calzia declined to answer and Judge
Kerrigan ruled in favor of his privi
lege. Then Mr. Hoefler asked
whether the priest intended to swear
that Yoell was not possessed of insane
delusions about his family; that Wil
liam had tried to poison him and that
John had sought his life. Said the
witness: "I mean to say what I have
said; that his mind was not unsound."
The ecclesiast said that he had never
"meddled" in Yoell's "family affairs."
Mr. Delmas called Mr. Colquohon,
RBsistant in the Mechanics' Institute
Library, who told of Yoell'-s frequent
visits and conversations about books,
their contents and qualities, indicative
of his shrewdness and soundness of
mind.
Another witness was Henry L. Davis,

ago and an acquaintance of Yoell for
more than fifty years. He was a be
liever in the intelligence and sound
ness of mind of Yoell.
Jonathan Sweigert, a Sheriff of
Santa Clara County fourteen years
ago, was also called. He vouched for

man was excitable and eccentric. He
told how Yoell. with some excitability,
had advised him to sell his Santa Clara
realty. Mr. Delmas, on redirect ex
amination, asked:
"Was he right in his advice?"
"He was," replied the witness.
"Have you followed that advice?"
queried the attorney.
"Well. I've tried to," said Sweigert,
v.-ith a tone of satisfaction.

HEARNE'S PLEA
IS CONVINCING
Divorce Is Granted to Man
Who Looked Upon Married
Life as Service in Hell
SAYS SHE CLAWED HIM
Waits for Permission to Ee
tire and Then Suffers the
Consequences of Her Anger
Judge Graham yesterday beat a {
hasty retreat from his proffered serv- j
ices as a reconciler in the case of Jo
seph against Johanna Hearne and Jo
seph was presented with an interloc- ;
utory decree of divorce. On the for- '.
mer hearing of the caae Joseph told
the Judge that he had been in hell for
more than four years, and after ex
plaining the details asked the court
how he would like it himself. Yes
terday Hearne gave more details, In
cluding his wanderings in the kitchen
of his home attired in a night gown
and awaiting his wife's permission to i
retire. After she gave the permission
she clawed him In the face with "her
long nails" and spoiled his appearance
in "good society."
Judge Murasky granted a divorce to
Charles F. Gibney from Adelaide Gib
ney on the grounds of cruelty and de
sertion. Gibney, it seems, became 111
and took a trip on the advice of his
physician. While he was away Mrs. |
Gibney sold his business and furniture
and went on the stage. He knew
nothing of the change until he met her j
in Spokane, when she told him that
she would not live with him again.
A divorce was granted by Judge -Heb
bard to Emma Busk from W. L. Busk
on a cross-complaint. Busk . sued on
the ground of cruelty, charging,
among other things, that his wife had
thrown a hatchet at - him. She made
a counter charge of . desertion, which
he failed to answer and she won the
decree.
Other divorces were granted thus:
By Judge Seawell to George Blessing
from Flora Blessing, . desertion; to
Thomas H. Erwin from Maggie Er
win, intemperance; by Judge Hunt to
Tillie Debauge from Paul Debauge,
convicted of manslaughter; by Judge
Troutt to Katherine L. Short from
James W. Short, cruelty; to Sadie A.
McCoy from James H. McCoy, deser
tion; by Judge Graham to Dale War
ford from George H. Warford, a war
rant officer in 'the naval service, de
sertion.
Mary E. Green sued for divorce from
George W. Green. They were mar
ried in June, 1902, and among other
charges, she says that he tried to stab
her and that her life was saved by the
steels in her corset. Frances Man
giaracina asks for . divorce from her
husband, Natala, on the ground of
cruelty. Besides charging him with
staying out nights, she says that he
ate all the victuals in their home, leav
ing her "the scraps and bones" until,
In her hunger, she had to go to her
mother for food. Actions for separa
tion were begun by Stephen Szegedy
against Mary Szegedy, infidelity with
Arthur . Potzak; Arthur O. Casey
against Maty Casey, desertion; Ellen

SISTEH AGAINST SISTER
IX CONTEST OF WILL
Mrs. MeTnmiiey Left Estate to One
Daughter and Other Charges
Undue Influence.
Mary McTamney died the latter part
of October, 1903, leaving an estate
worth more than $8000 and a will
which caused a disagreement between
her daughters. Mrs. Plant and Mrs.
Flowers were daughters of the de
ceased, but when the mother died it
was found that her will left all of her
estate to Mrs. Plant. Mrs. Flowers
alleges that herself, a brother and
another sister were left out of the
testament because of Mrs. Plant's ex
ercise of an undue influence upon her
mother. It is set forth that Mother
McTamney was bodily sick and bed
ridden for months and that in that
time Mrs. Plant made her mother be
lieve that she was the "only real and
good daughter," and that the other
children had refused to visit their
parent in her last sickness. It is even
said that Mrs. Plant employed others
to convey the idea that the remain
ing children were unconcerned about
their mother's welfare and thereby
the old lady's mind was poisoned.
When the time came for making the
contested will, it is said that Mrs.
Plant told her mother that the testa
ment which had been drawn for her
signature, divided the estate, share
and share alike, among all of the chil
dren.

Bristow Comes to Ascertain
Facts About Panama Roaci
and Its Steamship Line
Some time between March 20 and
April 10 J. L. Bristow, who was ap
pointed by President Roosevelt to col
lect evidence relating: to the Panama
Railroad and the Panama steamship
line and the conditions attending the
transportation in which the Panama
isthmus may soon become a prominent
agency, will begin to take testimony
in i?an Francisco. A letter from Wash
ington fixes the time when Mr. Bris
tow will arrive. He will conduct hear
ings in the rooms of the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce and has ex
pressed the wish to receive the assist
ance of the Chamber of Commerce in
gathering all available facts.
The importance of the isthmian rail
way in connection with the transporta
tion of freights and passengers be
tween the Atlantic and Pacific coasts
of the United States and the possibility
that the road will soon be thrown
open to all who wish to use it for the
moving of freight on even terms tends
to make the coming proceedings more
than usually Interesting. In his in-
Quiry here, according to Washington
advices, Mr. Bristow will get testi
mony concerning the advisability of
having the Government keep the
steamship line that goes with the Pan
ama road and is a Panama road as
set for use in the moving of freights
between the Eastern and Western
coasts of this country. A dinner may
be tendered to Mr. Bristow.

the coast, are more frequent. With stocks of
the favorite sizes comparatively light in all
positions, and the demand Increasing, an im
provement in prices Is believed to be due, some
looking for an advance of half a cent a pound
as possible, should the consumption continue

su-.xlÂ«i*'to add to their holdings. With the
prospwt of higher prices on the coast and the
rradual disappearance of the old cheap etock

NEW YORK. Feb. 27.â The bulky Â»tal of

Unued rise in prices. Mondays are always
chosen to effect a distribution of holdings and
to convert paper profits into cash. The Sun
day interval naturally leads to an accumula
tion of orders from outside sources in brok
er*' offices. The execution of thÂ«se offer-
Ings gives opportunity for selling to advantage,
Such a movement was clearly in progress to
day s_nc though a check resulted to the
rlne in prices, the absorptive power of the
tnarket was what was chiefly remarked The
resistance offered to the selling was not helped
toy any notable new development with the
exception of the striking movement in South
ern Pacific. The advance in this stock was
explained in tots* quarters a* an adjustment
to the recent advance in Union Pacific In
wliich the subsidiary stock has not Â«har*d
but an additional motive for the buying was
on-:- !n the circulation of the rumor that a
dividend payment 00 the stock had been prac
tlrally d-etermlnefl upon. This rumor lacked
ofneial confirmation, as did last week's many
ixmors of combination projects, but It waÂ«
at little impaired In its influence on that ac _

although it offered nothing to discourage the

I July to $1 01%. Then, without warning, the
market started to tumble. Within a few miu
utes the price of the May option was ham

â¢ gregated five million j . bushels. ' The decline
was , finally checked by liberal support from
a strong bull trader, who bought persistently

the day. Other biff houses also came to the
bupport *of the - market. Shorts took advan
tage '"of â ' the break and covered : freely. The
purchases affected a partial restoration of con
fienee and brought about a rally which land

In sharp contrast to the break " in wheat,
" corn closed decidedly stronger, almost at the
highest point of the day. May opened a shade
i higher at 47 % c. and closed at 48 He Late
: strength of corn had a buoyant influence on
I the price of oats. The market closed firm. May
| closed %c higher at 314 c. . -;.
i Provisions â  were firm .at the start on firm
demand from packers, but the break in wheat
caused a reaction. The market, however, soon
> became firm again, mainly as a result of the
strength of corn. At the close May pork was
!up 10@124c at $12 62%Â®12 65. Lard was
up 10c. at $7 024. and ribs were 74c higher

Bay country of Southern Oregon sold at $1 35
per cental, but $1 30 was the top for the gen
eral run of Oregon stock. Good Sweets were
firm, but poor stock was being forced for sale
at the inside quotation. Onions ruled firm and,
as was expected the market for fancy stock
advanced to 3c per pound. Two carloads came
In from the north and cleaned up ptomptly at
1 the advance.
Receipts of Asparagus were nearly 200 boxes
I and prices declined sharply. Two small lots
j of extra stock that came In early sold at 14c
and 15c per pound respectively, while the best
j selections of later arrivals sold from 10c to

were slow of sale at easy rates.

Butter, Cheese nnd Esrgs.
The feature of the market yesterday was the
demoralization in Eggs. Receipts were large,
as will be seen, and as liberal supplies hal
been left over from the preceding week the
market was heavily overstocked. The commis
sion merchants cut prices lc, but it did no
perceptible good, for they Fold no more Eggs
than before. Cards were sent out, offering the
finest ranch at 16c. The weakness Increased
as the day went on, and In the afternoon deal
ers who had refused to sell store Eggs under
18c In the forenoon w*re willing to let go
at 15c.
Butter continued steady, with the market
well cleaned up. and Cheese also was very
steady with light supplies.

Eggs and 10,100 lbs Cheese.

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Trade in Oranges was of fair volume and.
â with stocks in the open market comparatively
light, a firm feeling prevailed, but prices were
no higher. There was a marked scarcity of
fancy Navels and some well-known brands from
certain sections were firmly held at a pre
mium. The auction sale drew a fair attend
ance and the price* obtained were higher than
at the preceding sale. Eight cars were dis
posed of. fancy selling at $1 25<ft>l 85. choice
at 90c@$l 25 and standard at 85c@$l 10. Of
ferings of fancy were very light, being l.'sa

WITTMAN'S TRIAL COMMENCES
AFTER PLEA OF NOT GUILTY
Hutton Says Chief Was Not Remiss in
His EffoVts to Suppress Gambling.
Police Board Will
Offer Mass of
Testimony.
The sensational and much talked of
trial of Chief Wittman of the police
force was begun before the Board of
Police Commissioners last night, the
star witnesses for prosecution and de
fense being present, with Congressman
Julius Kahn representing the accused
Chief.
There were several interesting fea
tures, the most attractive being the
many bouts between Congrssman
Kahn and Commissioner Reagan, who
waf= questioner for the board.
The defers^ at once announced ready
and the delt-ndant's manner was a
challenge to the prosecution to do its
v, orst. Barly in the procedure Kahn
made the point that much of the com
ainss! nee. as set forth by Rea
gan. *. referring to pe
riods not covered by the charges. In
â¢ .no easf ih commission was forced
to withdraw its charges for the rea-
Fon tht:? set forth.
Former Police c"< mmiseioner Hut
ton's testimony was of unusual inter
est both because of his former aggres
sive attitude in reform movements and
because h< pwore that, in his opinion,
Chief Wittman had done all in his
power to suppress Chinese gambling.
The' trial will be resumed to-night,
and it is believed that it. cannot be
finished in less than three or four ses
sions of the board.
< HIKI --S MANNER DIGNIFIED.
The bluff Chief of Police came be
fore the commission in manner un
bended for the trial.
"Wait a minute, somebody wants to
see me outside." he spoke up as Presi
dent I'oheim called his name. A ser
geant had just whispered the message
in Wittman's ear.
The board puffed complacently at
its cigars while the Chief had his
brief interview in the" corridor.
On his return Secretary Boyne read
the three type-written pages that set
forth the charges of incompetence
and neglect of duty. On conclusion,
Poheim asked tersely, "Your plea?"
and with equal brevity the defendant
answered "Not guilty."
The trial started with the pace of
/.<-' fight.
"I wish to offer in evidence that
part of the charter which prescribes
the duties of the Chief of Police,"
< ame sharply from Drinkhouse.
â¢ No objection," was Kahns prompt
rejoinder.
"The secretary will read." naid the
pre*-)dem. swinging has gavel ner
vously.
"Waive the reading." yielded the at
torney, and it was evident that Kahn
was eager for expedition.
But the waste of words was to
-â¢ome. Reagan offered a communica
tion to the board, written by former
â¢ 'ommissioner H. W. Hutton on March
10, concerning the prevalence of
gambling in Chinatown. Objection
was made that the charges against
the defendant covered the period be
toween November 7 and November
29. and that a communication bearing
on conditions in March was irrelevant.
Furthermore. Kahn said Hutton was
â  witness and could give his testi
mony. The communication mas with
drawn.
MAYOR'S L,ETTER PRODUCED.
Then Reagan produced a letter
written by Mayor Schmitz in March,
1&03, calling attention to the existence
of fjintan and lotteries in the Chinese
quarter.
"Hm no relevancy to the case at ife
sue. but we will make no objection,"
remarked the Congressman.
Next was read a letter from the
Mayor dated April 21. 1903, af >r his
investigation of police aff-.rs in
Chinatown, in which he said he could
lay bare no evidence of corruption of
the department. He had ascertained,
however, that the "statesmen" col
lected a fund from the games osten
sibly for police protection, and strin
gent measures were urged to stamp
out this practice. The Mayor sug
i that the "statesmen" might be
arrested for obtaining money by false
jiretenses.
The first witness was George W
Lee, Deputy County Clerk. He had a
bundle Â«.f affidavits filed in the effort
to dipsolve the injunction the gamblers
had obtained restraining the police
from interfering with them. The affi
davits specified the locations of the
gambling clubs.
The first affidavit was that of Ser
geant Ooogan, who was in command of
the Chinatown squad during March
and April, 1903. On cross-examination
he said that at that time the games
were going at full blast at the many
places he designated.
"Did you try to stop those games?"
arked Kahn.
"I did. 11
"Did you succeed?"
"No, I could not stop the gambling."
Reagan had a newspaper clipping
that suggested the following query:
"Did you ever tell a newspaper re
rortÂ«?r that the Chief of Police told
you your work in Chinatown was satis
factory."
"I told the reporter that the Chief

CHIEF OF POLICE GEORGE W. WITTMAN WHO IP BEING TRIED BY THE
COMMISSIONERS ON CHARGES OF INCOMPETENCy AND NEGLECT OF
DUTY IX FAILING TO PKEVENT GAMBLING IN CHINATOWN
and all the Commissioners except Hut
ton were satisfied with what I had
done to suppress the games."
lIEAGAN FAILS.
Reagan's attempt to nail the Chief
on this point failed and the Commis
sioner had nothing further to say
about that clipping.
Coogan was not regarded as a suc
cess and he was withdrawn from the
detail after his meeting with the Com
missioners. Kahn said of the news
paper clipping: "You could hang a
thousand men on such testimony."
Reagan began* to show some ugly
temper toward Kahn. He assumed a
swashbuckling air in shoving his case
along against the protests of the at
torney.
The affidavits of Sergeant Jesse B.
Cook, who commanded the Chinatown
squad from November 12, 1902, to
March 1, 1903, and of Sergeant D. A.
Sylvester, who had charge from July
1, 1903, to Sept. 11, 1903, were read,
likewise making 1 oath as to the ex
istence and location of the fantan
"clubs" and the headquarters for the
lotteries.
"You did everything you could to
stop the gambling, did you not?" quer
ied Kahn.
"I did, sir."
"Did you in any wise neglect your
duty when you were detailed to sup
press the games?"
"I was not at all negligent. I did my
best. I could not stop the gambling,
however."
"Did you ever get more than eight
Chinamen in a raid? Did you ever
break the police record of eight cap
tures in one raid?"
"I did; yes, sir. I captured as many
as twenty in one raid."
SAYS RAIDS WERE FAKES.
Reagan made reference to the sup
position that raids were prearranged
and that seven cr eight men were made
available for arrest so the squad could
make a showing.
"Did Chief Wittman ever question
you about your work while you were
in command -of the squad?"
'"Yes, in August. 1903, he told me he
was dissatisfied with results In China
town. After an extended interview he
said he would try a new squad and
the next day I was given another set
of men."
"You say the Chief called you up
with a round turn for not doing better
in suppressing the games?" asked
Kahn.
"Yes, sir; he did. I had been doing
the best I could, however, before he
got after me."
Kahn and Reagan here mixed things
a bit. The Commissioner expressed
the opinion that the attorney's ques
tions were out of order.
"We called Sylvester to identify this
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 28, 1905.
affidavit merely and now you have led
him to tell us a fairy story about what
he did in* Chinatown," asserted the
Commissioner.
"I protest against the statement that
this witness is telling a fairy story,"
came the outburst from Kahn.
Reagan was rattled for a moment,
but finally succeeded in withdrawing
the aspersion he had cast. But his
temper did not abate.
SYLVESTER QUESTIONED.
The attorney questioned Sylvester to
show that there was much diligence
in breaking down heavy doors, block
ing getaways and flank movements
that must be resorted to In raiding
the gaming dens of the wily Chinese.
By stipulation the affidavits of all
other sergeants and policemen who
could tell of the games were consid
ered as read. Then the answer of Chief
Wittman himself in the injunction suit
was taken up. He herein set forth the
various places in which the games
were being conducted in Chinatown.
In vigorous terms the Chief had set
forth that the games were being oper
ated on a large scale. According to
the defense, however, the answer was
foreign to the issues at bar, for it was
made on August 24, 1904, whereas the
trial is on charges of failing to sup
press gambling between November 7
and November 29, 1904.
The reading of the long answer con
cluded, Sergeant H. H. Christiansen,
who commanded the squad from Jan
uary 1 to October 1, 1904, was called
to identify the affidavit he made in the
injunction case that gambling was car
ried on in the places the plaintiffs
sought to have protected from raids-.
It was an afterthought of Drinkhouse
that this Christiansen's statement
should be read with those of the other
sergeants who had had a try-out with
gambling in the punk-laden atmos
phere. The date of Christiansen's affi
davit was January 29, 1904.
"You did everything you could to
stop gambling in Chinatown, did you
not?" asked Kahn of the witness.
"Yes. I did the best I could." .
HUTTOX IS SWORN.
Former Commissioner H. W. Hut
ton was called to identify the com
munication he sent to the board on
March 10, 1903, relating the informa
tion he had received that it had been
agreed between the gamblers and the
police squad that a corruption fund
should be provided by levies as fol
lows: Lotteries, $20 a week; lottery
agents, $10 a week; fantan games,
per table, $5 per week; opium joints,
$2 50 a week.
These valuable rumors that Hutton
had picked up applied to Sergeant
Coogan's regime in Chinatown. The
witness was then led up to events con
temporaneous with the charges pend
ing and he once Tnore related his ex
periences in the raids of November 28
and 29, wherein it was demonstrated
conclusively that there was gambling
in Chinatown.
But just before he left the stand
Hutton made a statement that in his
opinion Chief Wittman made earnest
endeavor to suppress the games. The
witness had frequent conferences with
him as to the selection of squads and
the Chief was zealous in assigning the
.btst men he could find in the depart
ment to the difficult work in China
town.
L. G. Carpenter, attorney for the
"educational society," said that Chief
Wittman accepted proffered aid from
his clients by furnishing information
as to the games and that three raids
resulted. The witness also testified as
to the existence of gambling.
At this point the commission ad
journed to this evening at 7 o'clock.
Vow Din Must Go.
Tow Din, a shrimp merchant of this
city, must go back to China because
he had the imprudence to perform
manual labor in his establishment. A
decision to that effect was rendered
yesterday by United States Commis
sioner Heacock. Vow is a well-to-do
resident of Chinatown and for several
years has been engaged in selling
shrimps at wholesale. The complaint
that he had become a laborer and

Stales, was- instigated, he says, by

WANTS DOLLAR
RATE FOR GAS
Bourn Says a Lower Price
Would Cause Stockholders
or the Plant to Suffer
GIVES FIGURES ON COST
Says Absorbed Companies
Were Capitalized at Orig
inal Value of Properties
The Board of Supervisors yesterday
resumed the investigation into the
financial operations of the San Fran
cisco Gas and Electric Company as a
preliminary to the fixing of rates to
be charged for gas and electricity dur
ing the next fiscal year.
General Superintendent Naphtaly
testified that the present valuation of
the gas plant is $17,439,770. Naph
taly said that in 1902 its value was
$3 0,136,274 85. In 1903 several other
plants, aggregating $7,307,614 58, were
taken over and other items brought
the total value up to the amount
stated.
Naphtaly said that 5 per cent should
; be allowed for depreciation on the dis
j tributing plant, though in some cases
|it went as high as 15 per cent. The
J 1 per cent allowance on the pipes was
too low, said Naphtaly, in view of the
j increased damage due to electrolysis
' from underground currents.
Supervisor Braunhart introduced as
evidence the report of ex-City Engi
j neer Grunsky, prepared by a former
! employe of the company, to the effect
1 that 3 per cent is a fair allowance for
depreciation.
President W. B. Bourn testified that
the company had expended $468,033
â  for replacements to the electric plant
| in 1904 and had let similar contracts
amounting to $599,728. Replacements
, to the gas plant aggregating $961,000
I are contemplated in the next eighteen
: months.
Supervisor Gallagher drew from
Bourn the admission that the valua
1 tion figures submitted were based on
; the actual cost of original construc
i tion. The various properties acquired
| by the company were capitalized at
j the exact amount of purchase. Bourn
; said no specific examination of the
actual values of the absorbed plants
had been made by the company's en
gineers, the inventories of the plants
; and vouchers of the expenditures hav
ing been" accepted for the purpose,
i Gallagher argued that the company
j was not competent to judge of the
; valuation of the consolidated plants,
1 not having investigated the matter on
| its own account.
Bourn thought that a fair rate on
the investment of the stockholders of
the company would be from 8 to 10
per cent, but that they had been noti
fied that they would only receive 5
per cent. The company would be sat
itfied with a gas rate of $1 per 1000
cubic feet, Bourn said, but if a com
petitive company made a 75-cent rate
it would ultimately result in a higher
price for gas.
"We have a legal right to charge
$1 20 per 1000 cubic feet," said Bourn,
"but we believe $1 to be a fair rate.
A rate of 90 cents would cut down our
revenue $250,000 and the shareholders
or the plan itself would have to suf
fer."
Bourn said the amount of carbon
monoxide could not be reduced with
out reducing the illuminating quality
of the gas. The board adjourned the
investigation until this afternoon at 3
o'clock, when the operations of the
electric plant will be taken up.

UNITED RAILROADS ATTEMPTS
TO PAY ENORMOUS DIVIDEND
MODERNIZING OF SUTTER-STREET LINE AVOIDED
Burden of Inflated Interest-Bearing Properties Prevents Surplus
From Being Invested for the Good of the Public Service.
rTIHE United Railroads is attempting to pay interest on stock and
I bonds far in excess of the cost of the properties. When the system
-"*" was purchased from the Market- street Railroad Company $17,000,- .
000 was paid for it. The corporation is endeavoring to hold up its
end and pay interest on nearly three times that amount of money. This is
perhaps one of the reasons why it refuses to make a modern streetcar
line of the' old Sutter-street road- The protest against the present system
and the call for a conduit road is heard among prominent citizens and
property owners all over the city.
There is something otner than water
in the conduit that is worrying the
officials of the United Railroads of
San Francisco; it is water in the stock.
While It may be true that the cor
poration is endeavoring in a general
way to better street railway systems in
this city, is painting up old coaches
and adding a recent date to otherwise
uninteresting motor cars of ancient
manufacture, it has maae no particu
lar effort to overcome the mysteries of
time and space and, seemingly, prefers
to leave the problem to the scientists
who may be able to produce in the
good days to come some method of
producing rapid transit at a modicum
of expense.
When the city of San Francisco
handed over certain franchises to what
was then known as the Market Street
Railroad Company the people were to
a certain extent repaid, for in those
days the cable car was up to date and
the electric motor was in its infancy.
To-day the city is confronted with the
problem, "Shall the traveling public be
satisfied with methods that were in
vogue twelve years ago., or will the
people rise in protest against paying
interest on fifty millions of dollars on
a legitimate interest drawing valua
tion of about twenty millions?
As already said, water in the conduit
is not half so serious a detriment to
good service on the Sutter street rail
road as is water o-n the stock. The
$200,000 necessary to pay for the drain
ing of the line mentioned, were it to
be converted into a conduit system
road, would somewhat Interfere with
the paying of dividends on an exagger
ated capitalization. This, perhaps, is
the reason why the United Railroads
is threatening the public with a con
tinuation of the hook-and-eye service
of the almost defunct Sutter street
combination of lines. '
RAILROAD CONUNDRUMS.
The contention that an underground
serviceâ or one that will do away with
the overhead wire nuisance â is imprac
ticable on Sutter and Polk streets and
Pacific avenue because of the hills
would not prevent the conversion of
the Market street system as far as Va
lencia, Market street is level enough
to afford encouragement to an under
ground electric system and broad
enough to carry away In its gutters
a vest amount of water. But the Unit
ed Railroads is not fighting the con
duit roads from the standpoint of their
lack of utility, but because It is im
possible to pay dividends on $52,000,000
in stock and bonds when its gross
property valuation is estimated at $21,
000,000.
Among the prominent men of the
city who have invested heavily in res
idence property on the lines of the Pa
cific avenue section of the antiquated
Sutter street system are Charles Page
of the law firm of Page, McCutchen
& Knight; Captain Henry Mayer of
the shipping and commission firm of
Mayer. Wilson & Co., and Judge W.
C. Van Fleet. Judge Van Fleet is at
present visiting in the East, but he is
expected home in a few days. Prior
to his departure he authorized it to be
said that he had made a study of
street railroads and he was of the be
lief that overhead trolley systems
should be done away with altogether.
He is one of the large property owners
in the Western Addition who is op
posed to allowing any more unsightly
wires to mar the beauty of the home
district of the city and favors putting
all wires underground.
MR. PAGE'S IDEAS.
Charles Page said yesterday that he
was unalterably opposed to overhead
wires and to allowing the United Rail
roads to put in a trolley system on Sut
ter street. The people of Pacific
Heights and vicinity, he says, have en
deavored to make that section a pretty
district of homes to which any San
Franciscan who has interest In his
municipality can point with pride. San
Francisco has been criticized to a cer
tain extent by Eastern visitors for its
lack of attractive home districts and
Steamer In Trouble.
A telegram from Crescent City last
evening to the Hobbs-Wall Lumber
Company reported that a steamer, be
lieved to be the Oregon, was In trouble
about two miles off . shore at that
point. The steamer showed a heavy
list and was believed to be on lire.
The steamer Del Norte, owned by the
Hobbs-Wall Company, and a large
collier were standing by to lend aid.
The collier had taken off the steam
er's passengers, who were later trans
ferred to the Del Norte. The steamer
was believed to be in no Immediate
danger. The Del Norte was expected
to return to Crescent City late in the
evening with details of the distressed
vessel's name and condition, but up
to the hour of going to press no fur
ther word was received in this city.
Wagon and Buctct Collide.
A runaway Shasta water wagon col
lided yesterday afternoon with a light
buggy driven by "Walter Low near the
corner of Oak and Devisadero streets.
For a few minutes Low and the driver
of the water wagon, Frank Staeylish.
were mixed in a tangle of splintered
wood and maddened horses. Both men
received a severe shaking up. Low
was able to limp to his home, a few
blocks away. Staeglish's injuries were
treated at the Central Emergency Hos
pital.

Death of Broker Mattoon.
Joseph M. Mattoon, who had been
associated with his father for many
years in the customs brokerage Thisi
ness. died of pneumonia yesterday
morning at his residence on Hill street
after an illness of only a few days.
He leaves a wife and a child only
two and a half years old. The news
of his death came as a shock to his
brother brokers and the custom-house
officials, whom he had endeared by
his courtesy and affability.
See ths swell booklets we make. Edward
Knowlea Co., 84 Second street. â¢
in the northwestern part of the city
the owners of property have endeav
ored to plant gardens and maintain
lawns that will be the nucleus of a
home center of the first class.
To invade this distinctive, typically
San Franciscan section with an un
gainly trolley car system would be
to add to its disfigurement, for already
there are many more ugly wires strung
over its area than there should be.
Mr. Page says that nearly every home
builder on Pacific avenue and adjacent
streets is against the overhead trolley
line the United Railroads proposes to
construct.
Captain Henry Meyer, who has gone
to much expense to create a pretty
home on Pacific avenue and who voices
the sentiment of nearly all of the prop
erty owners in his neighborhood, said:
I should prefer to seÂ« the Sutter street road
and Its branches reconstructed as a modem
cable line rather than to give consent to
the building of the trolley line that the United
Railroads proposes. Sacramento. California,
Jackson and Pacific are streets that have been
improved at a great expense to property owners
and it is only Just to us that we be not
saddled with such an out-of-date line as that
which the United Railroads now maintains.
Already Pacific avenue is an entanglement of
ugly wires and clumsy wooden poles and to
string more wires there would be a shame.
The street Is lined with handsome residences
and San Francisco people take a deal of pride
in it. No. I don't want any overhead wire
car line there and it would be an outrage to

HAS STUDIED STREET LJN~ES.
One of the residents of Sutter street
who is in a position to speak from
knowledge of underground street rail
road systems is John F. Revalk of the
John F. Revalk Company, 532 Com
mercial street." Mr. Revalk lives at
1804 Sutter street. Recently he re
turned from an extended toar of the
cities of Europe and the Eastern
United States and while at Amsterdam.
Holland, he was shown over the new
system of surface electric roads that
have been constructed there under Gov
ernment supervision. Mr. Revalk said:
When the Amsterdam road was first planned
it was decided to try-out a four-mile section
in order that a thorough test might be given
the invention. This road proved so satis
factory tljat it was determined to extend it
and recently work was begun on an additional
five miles of line. In Berlin tt>* surface roads
were a great success. It was fourd that they
could be operated at a less expense than any
other class of street railroad and were much
more satisfactory to the traveling public.
New Tork has over eighty miles of conduit
roads and is planning for others. The man
agement of the lines showed that Increased
interest resulted from the properties and that
there wa3 less danger of accidents on the con
duit lines.
CONDUIT ROADS PAY.
J. C. H. Stut, whose report on surface
railroads is on file with the City Engi
neer of fhis city, is in favor of sur
face roads. Mr. Stut is considered an
expert on the subject. He says:
The Capitol Transit Company of Washing
ton. D. C, , whtrh Is by no means so large
a corporation as the United Railroads, and
which covers with its lines a territory no
greater than that covered by a combination of
three or four of the United Railroads' branches,
made a profit of over $600,000 in 1900. Before
the line was converted Into a surface system
the stock of the company was selling at $40
and $42. Now it is on the market at $luO.
Operating expenses decreased about 17 pet
cent.
In New Tork the profit on conduit roads Is
over $3,000,000 per year. Many new lines are
contemplated and the service has been a suc
cess throughout.
Supervisor Samuel Braunhart of the-
Supervisors' Street Committee is
against all overhead wires. He thinks
that where good trolley systems have
been constructed there should be no
change, but he is not in favor of let
ting any more permits for overhead
wires. He has looked into the mat
ter of conduit systems and has found
that they are a success.
Architect Hughton Sawyer, with Dr.
Julius Rosenstirn and Dr. George W.
Merritt, recently called on President
Holland of the United Railroads on
behalf of the Sutter Street Improve
ment Club and explained to Mr. Hol
land what * the people along Sutter
street expected of the corporation. Mr.
Sawyer said yesterday:
I was authorized by the Improvement Club
to tell the officers of the United Railroads
that our organization was willing to hire ex
perts to determine whether the surface road
was feasible or not and would bear the ex
pense of the investigation. I could not get
STORE VISITED
BY CRACKSMEN
An attempt was made early yester
day morning to blow open the safe in
the poultry store of Campagno &
Co.. 524 Clay street. The discov
ery was made about 5 o'clock when
the store was opened for business.
Police headquarters were notified and
Detectives Reynolds and Coleman were
detailed on the case.
They found that a hole had been
drilled In the safe above the combi
nation lock and the hole filled with
black powder. There had been no ex
plosion, the theory being that the safe
crackers had been stared away iefort
finishing the job. They had apparently
used wedges in an effort to force open
the door of the safe. In their hurry
to Bet away they left a small bottle
of oil and a squirt can behind. Pow
der was strewn around the floor near
the safe.
Entrance had been effected by break
ing off the lock on the basement door.
Then a piece of boar<. had been sawed
off the floor and through it the eraeks
men crawled to the store atft>ve. They
first paid their attention to the cash
drawer, from which tney stole $5
worth of two-cent postage stomps and
$2 worth of nickels.
This Is the first safecracking job in
this city for this winter and the police
think that some of the men who have
been operating successfully in Port
land recently may have come here to
try their luck. The store is within
a block and a half of the Hall of Jus
tice, showing that the attempt was a
bold one. The police have no clew to
the identity of the cracksmen
DRINKS CARBOLIC ACID. -Joseph Flan
nigan, a politician, ended his lire yestcrdav
by drinkin* carbolic acid in the D re,ence Jt
his wife on Fifth street, near Harrison^
any sa-Usfactton from the offlc*rÂ», although I
put the question to them several times. We
simply wanted to show the United Railroad*
that we could demonstrate that a conduit linÂ«
would pay them tf they would build 000.
The truth la that the corporation fears that
. it puts in a conduit on the 9utter-Â«tr<**t
system the road will prove so satisfactory to
tAe public that there will be a general demand
for conduit systems all over its line*.
Arthur D. McCann of 800* Sutter
street is another citizen who has been
very active in agitating for a better
system of street railroads for the city.
Mr. McCann has given the subject a.^
great deal of study. Regarding the?
drainage of the conduits he sayÂ«:
DRAINING IS EASY.
The United Railroads would have a* diffi
culty in draining a conduit. The excuse that
the hills would Interfere with tke system Is
foolish. The property owners on Sutter street
want no overhead wires. We want to g*t rid
of those already there, as they are unsightly
and a menace to the safety of property.
Supervisor Edward Rock of the
Street Committee is In favor of the im
provement of the cable line on Sutter
streetâ in fact, of anything that will
better the present disgraceful condi
tions on the Sutter-atreet road and its
branches.
Should the United Railroads continue,
to threaten Its patrons with the main
tenance of what is now known as "thÂ«i
Sutter-street flat-wheel system" there
will be an effort made to get at the
corporation in the courts if it can be
shownâ as it certainly canâ that the
Sutter-street double-enders are a men
ace to public health and safety and
an outrage on common decency.
