Among the men arrested in Utah were
James Mitchell, John Meyers and C. W.
Jones. The trio were In the habit of ob
taining their bounties under numerous
aliases, and it was this fact that made It
difficult for the authorities to trace the
offenders. The identity of Mitchell and
Meyers was finally established, and it
was later learned that they . both had
wives, who had left Utah. The '; women
were traced to San Francisco, and were
promptly placed under surveillance after
the arrival of Under Sheriff/ Sharp. It
was then learned. that one of these women
had been the medium through "which
$15,000 had been placed In the local banks,
and part of. this fund was. traced to, the
Bank of California. Before a garnish-
The swindling of "Western States by
fraudulent bounty claims has been a
practice of many years' standing, but it
was not until a few months ago that the
authorities of Utah suddenly swooped
down upon a number of guilty men and
began to thoroughly exploit their crooked
methods or. business, which they had
probably been pursuing for many years
at a great loss to that State. Undar the
laws of Utah a bounty of $5 Is paid for
\u25a0every scalp of a mountain lion or a bear,
51 50 for coyotes and a proportionate
Bmount for the hides of other animals
that prey upon the stock. An Investiga
tion by the authorities of Utah revealed
the fact that by connivance with officials
of several counties large sums of money
had been drawn out of the treasuries on
â¢warrants . fraudulently issued. It was
found that clerks had been bribed not to
officially mutilate the scalps presented to
them for bounty, and the scalps were
shipped away, only to be returned later
and presented again.
One Investigation alone showed that the
counties had been mulcted in the sum of
$Â£2,000, and that bides from various
States, among them Nevada, California
and Arizona, had been used to further
j the scheme of the swindlers. A number
I of arrests were made and three men en
tered a plea of guilty and are now serv
ing their time in the State prison. There
are now In the Jails of Utah five other
men, three of whom are County Clerks,
vrho are about to be tried, and before the
present Investigation is finished it Is ex
pected that half a dozen more men will
have been placed behind the bars. The
authorities of Utah believe that the gang
of swindlers was working for men of
higher stations in ' life, and while Under
Sheriff Sharp will not admit it. It was
reported here yesterday that two promi
nent men of San Francisco were sharing
in the swindle and furnished the neces
sary coin with which the purchase" of
hides from different States was made so
that the unlawful scheme could be suc
cessfully carried out.
TRACE PART OF MO.VEY.
THREE IX STATE PRISO.V.
Under Sheriff Joseph C. Sharp of Salt
Lake has been in this city for the last
two weeks, quietly directing from his
rooms in the Grand Hotel a search for
a part of the funds of counties In Utah,
systematically stolen by a band of
bounty swindlers, of whom several have
already been convicted, others ar
rested and several who are known
to have fled to this city. It is esti
mated that during a period of twelve or
fifteen months the Mormon State was
robbed of nearly $100,000. Of this
amount between $15,000 and $20,000
â¢w-as shipped out of the State and later
traced to this city, where it was de
posited in various banks by accomplices
in the gigantic robbery. It was to re
cover this money that Under Sheriff
Sharp was sent to Ean Francisco by
the authorities of Utah two weeks agro
and that he has been successful in~hls
mission was evidenced in a statement
made last night by his attorney. Charles
Fence, who admitted that Sharp was so
confident that he had located the money
that suits for Its recovery would bo
instituted here to-day.
Two women. Mrs. James Mitchell and
Mrs. John Meyers, the alleged wives of
two of the men now under arrest In
Salt Lake City, unconsciously gave the
Under Sheriff his first clews to the
whereabouts of the stolen money, which
resulted in garnishments being filed
upon the various banks in this city
last Saturday. The Under Sheriff does
not claim all the credit for the suc
cess of the work done In this city, for
â¢shortly after his arrival here he asked
the local Police Department for assist
ance and Detective Ed Gibson was as
signed to duty on the case and finally
located the two women, who had fled
from Utah several weeks before Sharp
started for San Francisco. Gibson was
also materially responsible for the dis
covery of the fact that the missing
money was on deposit In the local
banks.

PARIS, June 18.â The question of the
separation (of church and* state is still
occupying j practically, the \ whole atten
tion; of tiiel Chamber of "Deputies.- The
debate lasted, since March 20.
When; it is considered that the reform
means an : utter reversal, of the "long
standing I policy, which regarded . the
church as. a, constituent part: of the
nation, ; it is riot surprising the
discussion 1 lias been animated "at times.
However, ;'- the; ardor 'of the \ debates
seem- to aaive died out since the pas
sage' of the first four sections, tnough
the opponents. of the measure continue
to obstruct its passage to the best of
theiriiiuuity.. "' .':.-, ..'\u25a0'" '. ' . ..
- Despite this arid the long interrup
tions-Occasioned by the celebration of
three religious festivals, Easter, tho
Ascension^ and Pentecost. Â«, much has
been accomplished. Sixteen sections of
the total :o? thirty-seven have been
adopted.^ The fundamental .principles
of the new enactment include the dec
laration" that the state does not give
official recognition- to religion, the sup
pression of the. public worship !budget
and the settlement *of the great?prob
lem of . the disposal- of church prop
erty.. : Th'.s last forms one : of the most
difficult questions raised by the;bill. A
method ' of \u25a0 pensioning members' of the
clergy claiming long service has "also
been satisfactorily devised."
â¢;. It only remains now to settle a sys
tem for the formation of the parochial
bodies freshly brought into being for
tho direction of Government religious
edifices, and also to: provide regulations
for the control of .tho services. .These
two points. probably,: will arouse con-
Blderable argument, but the committee
having, the measures in- charge, shows
such willingness to accept reasonable
sufrgestions that itis believed -the en
tire bill will pass' through the Cham
ber before the j long vacation, which
will begin about ii;mbnth hence.

numerous young artists now gathering
laurels in the United States who have
Mrs,. Mason to thank for invaluable kind
nesses done them in their struggling days

interests of her young fellow-country
women that induced Mrs. Mason on her
arrival here seven years ago to iniereÃt
herself actively in the American Women's
Club, an organization rounded primarily
for the housing and care of American
girl students. Mrs. Mason has been the
brains of the club. A few nights ago the
club gave a brilliant farewell reception
in her honor, at which warm tributes
were paid by Mrs. Tower, wife of the
Ezubassador, and by Qther women who
arc familiar with Mrs. Mason's prodigious
cervices to the club. "She will carry from
Berlin four magnificent candelabra of or

Fiendish Crime in Nova
"Scotia Almost Leads to
the Lynching of a Woman
CHILD DEAD IN WOODS
Another Victim Securely
Bound Hand and Foot, but
Living When Discovered
Special Dispatch to The Call.
HALIFAX Nova Scotia, June 18.â
Bound and gagged, the body of 'May
Ward,'. six' years old, was found .yester
day in the woods a mile from Digby.. A
quarter of a < mile, away .-was \u0084 Elma.
Young, eighteen months old, tied hand
and foot and barely alive." The -chll-.
dren were cousins and had been miss
ing since 5 o'clock on ' Friday after
noon.
There is a deep mystery'surround
ing the affair, which is being investi
gated by tho Coroner. Mrs. Young ih
gists-that she, is innocent of any crime,
and states that she believes ay.a v . tramp
entered the house, stole the children
and tried to kill both.
Mrs. Young has been '. housekeeper
for months for Kingsley Melorison. ShÂ«
says her husband was Fred Young, a
lawyer of Boston, who died more than
a year a^o. - Little May \Vard T s mother
is dead and her aunt has -cared for her.
The two children were found by a
searching- party* in the woods of Plyrii
ton. The baby was lying on' lts face,
tied hand and foot. Its mouth had
been stopped -.with a' cotton hood,
which had; been rolled, ua and bound
tightly- across , the face. The hands
had been bound up.;_ under the chin:
In its- struggle to free "its hands the
.hood which stopped tne mouth and nose
had became displaced and the Infant
thus escaped suffocation. ' ' \u25a0â¢: ...
The elder child was dead. Her hands
and feet were bound, and across tho
mouth and nose : was a largo. burdock
leaf; Over this the child's hood"; had
been tightly drawn and , tied with a
rope of ram.' '. \u0084 â¢". â¢'
Mrs. Young and Melonson met the
searching party , after < the baby had
been found. Tho crowd , threatened
the woman and demanded that she tell
where the other child was. Mrs. Young
protested that she did not -.know, and
several men in the . crowd suggested
that they hang the- woman, on tho
spot.
Co*oler counsel \u25a0'. prevailed and . the.
fecarch continued. .";' .-"While walking
through the wood3"the searchers came
to a cow tiath, nnd Mrs.' Young sui;
gentcd that they turn to. the right.
Being- suspicious, however, the* crowd
turned to. the left, and soon found, the
body of the elder child. / r
â¢ Mrs-. Young- was immediately ar
rested and taken to Jail.

' "The Adventures " of Lady Ursula,"
that . ever popular play, was greeted
with enthusiasm at the California
Theater last night by one of the best
houses of the present season. As
usual, Florence Roberts was the shin
ing light of .the production, and as
Lady Ursula she was given ample op
portunity to display, her , tact and tal
ent in the role ' that seems to suit her
admirably.
Miss Roberts made" an excellent Lady
Ursula. Every one in, the house was
agreed on that " score.' .. Her make-up
was charming, and she portrayed the
part of the youth in disguise in a be
wltchlngf manner. The role is not a
new one for Miss Roberts, she having
starred in the : . same â¢ here \u25a0 many' times.
Her acting last night was as ..clever as
ever- before, and 1 those who had the
pleasure . of \u25a0 seelnf her In the . part
heretofore were amply ? repaid \u25a0by their
visit to the California last night.
\u25a0Miss Roberts was given capital sup
port by the entire company. Lucius
Henderson \u25a0as Sir' George Sylvester
made a strong 7 leading man, while
Franklin Underwood, William Yerance,
G. Gregory Rogers and Herschel May
all portrayed the old style English
gentlemen ' in a manner that won > high

You do feel that way about little
Bessie Fre'nchl Bessie sings by the grace
of God to begin with, with substantial
help from a Chicago teacher 7, named
Stevenson. Mr. Stevenson deserves to be"
named. ' Bessie has been taught to use a
voice phenomenal to begin with in a phe
nomenal way. ", She . sings in. absolutely,
unforced fashion; the voice Is perfectly
placed; her pitch is tune to a hair and she
phrases like a veteran. Add to this the
remarkable range and . volume \of the
voice, the little singer's exquisite feeling
âmature in taate," yet childlike In senti
ment, and a technique of astonishing sort,
and you get a child. vocalist. of a kind that
you are unlikely to hear soon again. The
lltile girl sang : last night the "Mlgnon"
song of D'Hardelot. the "Pletl Signor" of
Meyerbeer and "Mighty Lak a Rose"â
that Xordica" brought here. . She seems
to enjoy the singing as much as you en
joy the listening and is conspicuously
pretty figure a la Watteau in her curls
and bows and little pink gown.
There is another distinct novelty in the
waste of bullets and tired jokes that
makes up the programme In - large part.
Miss Lillian Shaw is a hostess In herself.
It will. not do Miss Shaw any. harm to
say that she has seen Elfle Fay. Nora
Bayes, who used to enliven Fischer's, is
another of whom Miss- Shaw reminds.
But Miss Shaw is peculiarly herself in
the imitation of the lady ; Hebrew of the
East Side.: She is a female Joe Welch,
who can also "sing," in; vaudeville par
lance. She has a dialect that Barney
Bernard would be proud of, and stories
only just out of the sawdust. Miss Shaw
is as happy in the " banan" and "spa
ghett" vernacular as she is in the He
brew, and is ' generally an unexpectedly
piquant person.
If the baby Pattl at the Orpheum this
week goes the way she should go, you' will
be hearing things of Mies Bessie French
six or seven ' years ' hence. , Bessie is an
nounced as Vthe child prima donna" s and
sings up to the name. She is nine years
old and looks seven.* * She sings little
things' . like the "Pletl Signor'* and
D'Hardelot's "Mlgnon," and her repertoire"
includes as many airs as most phono
graphs. Usually there is : nothing more
victoriously unpleasant .than the child
singer of vaudevilleâ except it be- the

i CHIEF ENGINEER IN* CHARGE. OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PANAMA
CANAL, WHO IS ENCOUNTERING MUCH DIFFICULTY IN \ OBTAINING
LABOR TO PROCEED WITH THE DIGGING OF THE WATERWAY.
CULEBRA. Isthmian Canal Zone,
June 18. â Every incoming steamship
from New York. New Orleans or San
Francisco brings to Colon and Panama
a contingent of Americans recently ap
pointed to canal work. Every outgoing
ship takes homes its quota of return
ing employes.
Two months ago, while Chief Engi
neer Wallace was in the States select
ing' his appointees, the arrrivlng squads
were large â sometimes fifty In a
bunch. Recently their numbers have
markedly fallen off. On the contrary,
departures are Increasing rather than
diminishing, a state of affairs which is
causing concern In the Government
building.
Numbers of the men return home by
the very next steamship, without even
attempting to enter upon their duties.
Others that are leaving are employes
discharged from disability or Inability.
By far the greater number of those who
have left simply quit as soon as they
had earned their passage home and
"seen the elephant."
Press reports from home indicate a
belief that fear of a fever epidemic is
at the bottom of this serious outflow of
whites. This Is a gross error. The
prime cause Is the widespread discon
tent with general conditions, natural
and administrative. As a matter of
fact, there is not now an undue amount
of sickness In the zone. The popular
Impression at home concerning the un
healthfalness of the Isthmus Is exag
gerated.
The hospitals are not overcrowded,
either here or at Ancon, which In
cludes the Panama district.
Under the prevailing conditions . ef
fective work must soon cease, unless
foreigners be called In, a measure which
would be repugnant *to the nation. Little
Indeed, has thus far been accomplished.
Chief Engineer Wallace and his right
hand executive. Captain E. L. King,
have now returned to the zone and
Â» ,oubtlesÂ» things will' take a better
turn.
The French company spent nearly
$800,000,000 on the canal and yet failed
of its purpose. The chief contributing
cause was the difficulty which is now
confronting the Americans here. The
men here are subjected. to unnecessary
and irritating harassments, without
any mitigating compensations. Their
pay Is no greater than in the States. In
other particulars the employes brought
here are much worse off than in the
States. Every Item that goes to make
life pleasant is conspicuously absent,
with no promise of improvement. The
men feel that there is a total lack of
interest In higher quarters in their per
sonal welfare. They .have been pro
vided with no diversions from labor and
care.
A cash reward is offered for the
discoverer of the famous lawn tennis
courts and baseball grounds so graph
ically described in newspaper corre
spondence. There is not an amusement
of any kind at Culebra, the chief cen
ter of excavation. In the whole divi
sion there is not a lounging place or
reading-room, such as soldiers often
have In most remote posts, y
A potent cause of discontent is the
unsatisfactory quality of the board pro
vided, although the price Is relatively
high.
WASHINGTON, June 18.â Chief Engi
neer John F. Wallace of the Isthmian
Canal Commission will, arrive in Wash
ington on June 22,' and before he returns
to Panama some problems connected with
the work of canal digging will be settled.
Wallace will have conferences with Pres
ident Roosevelt and Secretary Taft.
From various unofficial sources have
come rumors cf friction between Wallace
and some one else, but no details are ob
tainable, and officials here dirparage any
such talk.
Wallace ' when made a member of the
Canal Commission at $7600 a year, with
additional compensation of $17,500 as chief
engineer, was told that he would have
unlimited, sway as chief engineer. One
highly Important matter, " the award of
contracts for dredging Colon harbor, at
a' cost of several j million dollars, | awaits
Wallace's return. . Many, prospective bid
ders on this contract asserted that the
time allowed before opening the bids last
week was top short to enable them to go
into the Job with their eyes. open, \ and
that the specifications issued were faulty.
Notwithstanding 7 the protest the" bids
were opened, but no award has been
made or will be made until Wallace'ar
rives In Washington.

A weak stomach is most fre-
quently caused by the over-
worked and exhausted nervous
system.
The power that runs the
stomach is the nerve force sent
to it from the brain through
the nerves. When the nerves
axe weak or exhausted the sup-
ply of energy is insufficient
and the action of the stomach
is impaired/ and results in im-
perfect digestionâ dyspepsia.
Drl Miles' Restorative Nerv-
ine increases nerve force. It
strengthens and builds up nerve
tissue, gives vigor to the nerves
and muscles of the stomach;
this produces a healthy activity.
Nervine allays the inflamma-
tion/ heals the membranes, and
makes the stomach strong and
healthy. \ There is nothing that
so quickly gives energy fo the
whole system as Restorative
Nervinc^Sj
"I can't say enough for Dr. Miles'
Vervine. I don't know what . It will
do for others, but It certainly cured me
of stomach trouble, and now I am as
well as I ever was. Two physicians
failed to relieve me. but in three or
four days after taking Nervine Uwas
Jnuch relieved. Four Wtles mad* me

It was in the year 1112, according to
historical record, that a great famine
swept over Portugal. The Queen and
her consort, Dinez I, prayed with the
people. In the midst of the troubles,
the legend runs, a great ship, laden
with provisions, was wrecked on the
sea coast. The Queen with her own
hands distributed the food and saved
her famishing people.

OAKLAND, June 18.â Mayor Frank K.
Mott has taken official notice of the ac
tion of Chief of P-olice Hodgkins In per
mitting agents of a lottery company to
mutilate a winning ticket for $7500 while
it was held, by the police department as
evidence against John Perry, charged
with 'selling lottery tickets. ' . y
An investigation of the affair will be
held by the Police and Fire Commission
ers, of which board Mayor Mott is ', pres
ident. His Honor announced to-day that
he " had \as ; yet received , no formal report
on the subject from the Chief of Police,
but had- taken notice of the matter
through the public press, and decided that
it could not be passed by without a close
inquiry.
Concerning the case, Mayor Mott said:
"By reason of the statements that have
been made in the press as to this lottery
ticket transaction,*, I shall be compelled
to give \u25a0it of ficial attention. The Board
of Police and Fire Commissioners will in
vestigate' it. I shall not attempt to pre
judge the case, but I shall see to it that
proper step 3 are taken if there has been
anything done prejudicial to the good of
the police department, or to the best in
terests in general of the municipal gov
ernment" '
Both of the other Commissioners, City
Attorney McElroy and City Engineer
Turner are of the same opinion as their
colleague, the Mayor.
Independently, of the board, Prosecuting
Attorney A. P. Leach has taken up a
line of inquiry, into the CtUef's action.
Leach was taken off his feet yesterday
morning in the Police "Court, where for
the first itlme he learned of the mutila
tion of the coupon. The ticket, with
many '\u25a0 others that were not prize-win
ners, .was In controversy. Perry, from
whom the tickets had been seized, con
tended he was entitled to possession of
them. His anxiety to get them was due
to .the fact-, that he knew there was a
$7500 coupon -in the package. He. did not
know until r the mutilated ticket was
found that his fight would be of no avail,
even if his point of ownership were up
held by the court.
.The: ticket in-question was a double
coupon,- and the printed numbers in eich
section were torn out, the removed ~its
of ' paper being carried away by the lot
tery company's representatives ' when
they left the Chief's office. The Prose
cuting Attorney has in hand the ques
tion whetheiv a . statutory .offense was
committea In the mutilation of. the cou
pon, and whether; he shall' / proceed
against any or all of those Concerned.;
Highland subdivision of Adams Point

Wlckham Havens has recently pur
chased a tract of thirty acres in the
vicinity of Piedmont and Moss avenues
from the Pope Estate Company and 11.
and W. Pierce. This tract, which is
called the Fair Oaks, will be at once sub
divided Into building lots and placed on
the market. .
The E. P. Vandercook Company reports
that during the present month there has
been a noticeable increase in the demand
for residence property of all kinds, and
that many of those seeking homes in
Oakland are people from other parts of
the State or from the East.
Al Kreiss of the firm of Kreiss &
liforswill reports several fair sales â¢of
residence property for the last week, and
cays that never before, since he has
been engaged In the real estate business,
have there been so many inquiries for
property of this class in Oakland.
Holcomb, Breed & Bancroft have just
placed on the market another large tract
on Fifty-fourth street, Just west of Mar
ket. This tract contains twenty choice
building lotsrall of which are within less
than five minutes' walk of the new Key
Route depot on Fifty-fourth street, be
tween Adeline and Market. This firm re
ports the 6ale of fifty-two lots in the
various Santa Fe tracts in this vicinity
in the last two months, on all of which
new homes have been erected or are now
in course of construction. Seven of these
new homes have been built by people
from San Francisco.
In no locality has the recent develop
ment of Oakland been so marked as In
the tracks along the new lines of the Key
Route system, and in nearly every case
where property in these tracts has been
sold the purchasers have at once begun
the erection of homes on their lots. As a
rule the value of these new homes, with
lots on which they stand, is from $2500
to 55000.
KEY lIOUTE DEVELOP3IEXT.
During the last week there has been
a Blight lull in the demand for business
property In this and the other cities of
Alameda County, but this has been more
than counterbalanced by the Increased
number of Inquiries for residence prop
erty in all parts of the county. Prominent
real estate men say that fully 50 per
cent of these inquiries come from people
who are either non-residents of Alameda
County, or who have recently come here
from other parts of â¢ the State or from
the East. There has been a steady in
crease in the sale of medium-sized resi
dence properties since the opening of
the present month, and Just now there
is nothing in the condition of the market
to indicate that there will be any falling
oft In the volume of business for some
time to come. ,
OAKLAND, June 18.â One of the larg
est Investments in Oakland residence
property of the present year was made
last week by Calvin Brougher, a Tono
pah millionaire. He purchased fifteen
acres of land on Claremont avenue, oppo
site the handsome Butters residence, and
will immediately begin the erection of a
beautiful home. The plans for the house
have already been prepared by John Co
nant, & local architect, and the contract
was let last Friday for all the work on
the new structure. The specifications call
for a ten-room house, to be thoroughly
fireproof and modern in every respect.
It will be constructed of brick and gray
stone, and the inside finish will be en
tirely of hardwood.
Twenty thousand dollars will be spent
In the erection of the new residence. It
will be occupied as soon as completed by
Mr. Brougher and his family. It is un
derstood that the price paid for the prop
erty purchased by the mine owner was
Â£S,OOO, and this added to the cost of the
residence to be erected represents an in
vestment of $45,000. The new owner of
the property is one of the owners of the
famous Belmont-Tonopah mine in Ne
vada, and is a member of one of the
wealthiest syndicates of the Sagebrush
State.

Fleming came to the Pacific Coast on
the advice of the physicians who were
attending his wife in the East. They
told him that the only way to prevent
a fatal termination of the disease from
which she was suffering was to- take
her at once to a warmer climate. By
selling off all his personal property, Flem
ing secured the necessary funds to pay
for the family's transportation to Los
Angeles, where be hoped to secure em
ployment as- a carpenter. . ...
The .unexpected fatal Illness of the
baby, however, has bo far depleted the
slender store of money left after .the
tickets were purchased that the family is
now almost penniless. On discovering
this Steward Borchert notified Mrs. ..J.
McCarthy, secretary of the Catholic'- La
dles' Aid Society, who has secured quar
ters for the family at the Arlington Ho
tel, and has arranged for the funeral of
the child. .This will be held as soon as
possible, but as there was no physician
in attendance when the child died, It is
expected that the Coroner will hold an
Inquest to determine the cause of death,
which Is believed to have been cerebral
meningitis.
The parents called at the offices of sev^
eral physicians, but were unable to find
any of the doctors in, and as a last re
sort the father inquired the way to the
Receiving Hospital, and was on his way
there when the child passed away. The
death of the baby happened about 10
o'clock, for when the parents arrived at
the hospital about 10:30 it was plain that
life had been extinct for some time.
OAKLAND, June 18.â Carrying the dead
body of his infant daughter in his arms,
but Ignorant of the fact that death had
already robbed him of his child, George
P. Fleming arrived breathless at the Re
ceiving Hospital this morning, and begged
Steward Harry Borchert to save the life
which haa already fled. A glance at the
whitened features of the babe showed
Steward 'Borchert that the little one was
past all earthly aid, but the heart-broken
father could not believe that his child
had passed away, and begged that a doc
tor be called. Dr. George G. Reinle an
swered the summons to the hospital, but
he could only confirm the declaration of
the steward that the baby was dead.
Fleming arrived in this city last night
from North Collins, N. V., on his way to
Los Angeles, where he is taking his fami
ly in an effort to save the life of his wife,
who is afflicted with consumption. Owing
to the sink in the Southern Pacific Com
pany's tracks on the Suisun marshes, the
train on which he had crossed the con
tinent missed connection with the train
for the south, and Fleming was compelled
to stay over in this city last night. Dur
ing the night the two-year-old baby,
Genevieve, who had been sick the greater
part of the journey from the East, grew
worse and the father sought the services
of Dr. Meigs, the railroad physician, who
prescribed for the child, but with little
effect, for the baby grew steadily worse.
Early this morning Fleming and his wife
left the train, which had been run to the
Oakland pier, and came to this city in
search of medical attention for the little
one.
Superintendent Waterman declares,
in spite of the withdrawal of the chil
dren referred to, that the total attend
ance: has greatly increased, so that a
substantial increase in State and coun
ty appropriations for the schools may
be expected.
The attendance for the year has been re
duced by about ICO pupils aa one result of
the enforcement of the. law. as many parents
have taken their children from, the public
schools \u25a0 and have entered them ' elsewhere.
Most of these will re-enter the public schools
at the beginning of the new year, since it la
now understood that the law will, in all cases,
be enforced. " *
Since this action of the board no sew pupils
have been admitted to any of the schools) with,
out certificates of vaccination. \u25a0
Discussing this phase of the school
year's incidents, Superintendent Water
man, says in his report: . '/,*â¢" \u25ba,'
During the first term of the past year the
Board of Education, acting under the instruc
tion of the Stats Board of Health, made pro
vision for the enforcement of the compulsory
vaccination law. Xearly 1000 of the school
children were vaccinated and about 300, were
admitted to the schools on csrtincates of vari
ous physicians. These certificates were only
temporary In their action and they were all
referred to the town health officer for settle
ment. : -â â¢ â¢ -
BERKELEY, June 18. â The number
of children In the public schools of
Berkeley has been reduced about 100
through the operation of the compul
sory vaccination law, according to Su
perintendent of Schools Waterman,
whose report for the last year has just
been made to the Board of Education.
This law was strenuously 'opposed
by many citizens of the university
town, and a league was formed to fight
it and secure the repeal, of legislation
oSnoxious to league members.-. The
children of such members were with
drawn from the public schools. It was
not supposed, however, that the num
ber thus taken from the school rolls
was as large as reported by Superin
tendent Waterman, and surprise ac
cordingly is expressed by those who
have learned of the facts. ' .
OAKLAND, June 18. â Mrs. Margaret
Smith, whose record for attempts at
suicide reaches twenty-one, again tried
to destroy her life to-day in the City
Prison. Had it not been for the prompt
action of Jailer Burt Curtis, the woman
would have occupied a slab in the
morgue and Oakland would have lost
one of its queer characters.
For a number of years Mrs. Smith's
doings have been features of police
court and hospital circles. She is a
confirmed drunkard and , recently has
shown signs of insanity whenever she
has been imbibing freely.. About one
month ago the woman visited the music
store of Sherman, Clay & Co., on Broad-,
way and announced that she was Mel
ba. She demanded that the manager
of the store -give, her JlOOO to sing into
a phonograph and when she. was or
dered from the place, she began using
language that caused her arrest on
charges of using vulgar . language and
disturbing the peace. She was given
thirty -days in the county jail and
promised to reform at the end of that
period. As soon as she was released
yesterday, however, she went back to
her old haunts and was arrested this
morning at the corner of Seventh and
Franklin streets on three charges of
disorderly conduct.
After the woman had been in the
cell for some time. Jailer Curtis j was
attracted by a strange noise and found
her hanging to the bars in an almost
strangled condition. She had torn her
skirt into strips, braided. them together
and placed the improvised rope about
her neck. . \ \ ,
Dr. Ewer was . called and soon I had
the patient out of danger.

The Duke "and Pasha Pleasant had to
run the deciding course of the reserve
stake twice. At the first attempt Judge
Reilly called it a> "no course," 'as the
dogs were unsighted for a, time and the
trial" -was not satisfactory. Both were
tired at the second attempt, but The
Duke lasted long enough to win by a sev
en to six score. . .
E. Scott's black and white greyhound
Panoche outfooted all competitors at Un
ion Coursing Park yesterday; in the class
stake. He led Mr. Zlgnego, the Stockton
flyer, by two lengths in the Â» semi-final
round, and then led Freeport four lengths
in the deciding course. He; seemed to
tire after the lead. up, and in a trial last
ing sixty-one seconds was lucky to' win,
the score being eight points to six. â¢
G. Lacy Crawford's crack greyhounds,
Agile Spurt and Rector, took first and
second money in the class stake yester
day at Ingleside Coursing Park. In the
run off the former dog beat his kennel
mate for first honors. Homer Boy re
gained his old form, and defeated Impe
rious in the deciding course of the re
serve'stake without much trouble. After
having the best of the early coursing in
the deciding round of the open stake with
Dorette, Mark Twain could not stand the
pace and was beaten out by the young
dog in a severe test.
The talent experienced much trouble in
picking winners, as many short ends
scored throughout the day. The dogs in
most instances were evenly matched,
which resulted in some heavy betting.
The defeat of Lancashire Lad at 1 to 5
was the biggest upset of the day. The
following are the day's results, with

That made the score 3 to 2 in favor of
San Francisco. Uncle felt he needed an
other run, so" his employes proceeded to
get busy in the eighth. Waldron blngled
and Corbettlet the.ball go between his
legs. Hundreds of fans wondered, why
Wally did not tear into second, but the
umpire watched the play closely and saw
that Wally did not touch the bag ere he
started.: Wally saw the umpire looking
and had to go back and tag. His mistake
did not" flgurer for "Hildebrand put one
through to right garden for. three a sec

he wanted to get the ' run.
' It was a great day for the outfielders.
Corbett and Hildebrand out in the left

Spencer had six hard chances in right.

Maybe the Seals would have been chased
away with, a game if Mr. Essick had cut
out that old spit ball of his before the
sixth spasm. He decided to stick with the
old, shoots,** and the Seals became jerry to
them about the time the fans were yearn
ing for a run or so to show.
It all' happened in round six. Up to
that time the man from the Mormon town
was Indian signing every man to .whom
Uncle pays money. The Salt Laker got
In wrong in' the sixth, when he threw
Williams' bunt over Cates' head and nearly
out to the bleachers. -Nick was at second
before Judge McCreedie had a chance to
take another tuck :in his trousers, and
he came right : through on Kid Spencer's
double to . right: ' . ', .
That put the \gang right for rooting.
They only had K> holler for an instant,
for Waldron came through with one to
left, and Spencer kept on hotfooting till
he landed! Wheeler lost no time in crash
ing out another.so that Wally could plant
his feet' on the rubber without losing any
energy.
- Uncle completed a f successful little pil
grimage toward the top of the percentage"
table yesterday by slipping a couple of
bunches to' the Giants. Bvery man on
his list had to go a bit before the double
stunt' was turned so that the fans ap
proved, but the work was not all rough,
and the Seals left the field of battle riding
easily. Scores: Morning gameâ San

HKSULTS OP GAMES.
In singles Carl Gardner* and George
Janes played three sets. Janes has been
out of the game for about a month and
the greatly improved Gardner beat him
easily. All three sets went to the latter
by 6-2 scores.
Melville Long and Grant Smith played
two interesting sets. The latter has had
no practice of late, but played a fair
game. He won both sets, the score being
7-5, 6-4.
In doubles Harry Rolfe and Dr. Bush
took Gardner and Janes into camp. The
former lost the first set, but pulled out
the next two. Bush did some clever driv
ing and received good support from Rolfe.
The score was 3-6, 6-4, 6-3.
Most of the cracks of the California
Club were out of town yesterday and but
few matches were played on the club
courts.
In the second and third sets Adams
played even better than in the first.
while Griffin kept facing away. Adams
indulged his opponent with the lead in
the first part of both sets, but when he
settled down won prttty much as he
pleased. Adams* swift service and accu
rate forehand drive won many aces for
him. Griffin made two mistakes â one in
playing the bails to Adams' forehand and
the other in taking the net position.
Adams has improved his net game since
he lost to Gardner last month, and any
cf the cracks wiil have to play high-class
tennis to beat him in future. The score
of the match was 11-10, 6-4. 6-2.
In the semi-finals Griffin beat Harold
Gabriel easily. In the first set Gabriel
was outclassed, but in the second he
made an excellent showing and came
close to winning. The score was 6-1, 9-7.
Adams is a quiet, unassuming young
player and his victory was a popular one.
He has shown up well in some of the
tournaments held recently, but this is the
lirst time he has carried off the honors.
The competition was the first of a series
for a new silver cup and as a result
Adams' name will be the first inscribed
on it.
The semi-final match between Adams
and Baker was the best of the tourna
ment. A few figured Adams would make
a good showing against Baker, but they
conceded him but little chance to win.
\u25a0\Vhen Baker won the first set by a score
of 6-3 and had a lead of 5-3 in the second
eet he looked almost a sure winner.
Adams, who is a cool and determined
player, kept pegging away and with a
burst of speed pulled out the next four
fames and the set.
The third set was a repetition of the
second. Baker started with a rush and
took four out of the first five games.
Adams again proved he is an excellent
uphill player. From this point on he out
played Baker and the latter was unable
to win another game. Adams drove with
remarkable accuracy and passed his op
ponent time after time. The score was
S-6, 7-5. 6-4.
Adams proved his victory over Baker
was by no means a fluke when he com
pletely outplayed Griffin in the finals. The
latter was in his old-time form and played
Awards to a standstill in the first set.
Griffin had Adams point set at 6-5, but
after this was never better than on even
terms with his opponent. Adams was
teveral times within a point of winning
the set, but did not do so until the twen
ty-second came had been played.
Another young tennis player camÂ© Into
prominence yesterday when Fred Adams
carried off the honors In the first class
tournament at Golden Gate Park- George
Baker, for many months the park cham
pion, had his colors lowered by Adams.
The winner kept up his good work and
beat Clarence Griffin In the finals In three
straight fcets.
i SHEEPSHEAD BAY, June 18.â James
I B. Brady's Oiseau will make his second
appearance of the year this- week when
he. goes to the post ; for f,' the -Swift
stakes, at seven furlongs. . He | is en
titled to/a, liberal weight allowance.
As he worked well on Tuesday it: may
be assumed this fine coltwill not dis
appoint his owner and trainer this time.
Brady has, however, Welterweight, a
most capable substitute for Oiseau in
case the latter should fail. It is the
part of wisdom to ; start Oiseau in just
such a stake as the" Swift and thus
gradually key him, up for higher honors
later in the year. ; Sysonby. is engaged
irt the, Swift stakes, for which his
weight is 130 pounds.. .
Mr. Keene has Mildmlnt and Yon
Tromp alsoin the race. There are at
least half a dozen who will make it an
interesting event. A. J. Joyner, trainer
of Tradition, expects to start her in
the Mermaid on Wednesday. , â¢ .
.Her opponents will be Coy Maid, In
cantation. and possibly Mistress and
Homebody.. It would- appear to be. a
certainty for Tradition. .On Thursday
the public may be gratified with a look
at Queen of Hearts, a full sister to Art
ful. She? is in the Surf stakes, 7 at five

Klttredge, Inquisitor, Jacobin and other
likely opponents. V \

The feature of the rifle contests at
Schuetzen Park yesterday proved to be
the struggle for the Meunier trophy.
On his recent visit to this coast Captain
John Meunier of Milwaukee presented a
handsome gold medal, to be competed
for by surviving members of the Cali
fornia Centennial team, and much In
terest was taken -in the result. Cham
pion Adolph Strecker was the lucky
man to place his shot nearest to the
center of the target, coming within .S3 l
of an inch from a dead center. He was
closely followed by Philo Jacoby with
.345. Both of these shots were within
the circumference of a dollar piece at a
distance of - 200 yards. A. Rahwyler
came next with' 1.113 points and Wil
liam Ehrenpfort made 2.234.
In the bullseye contest of the Califor
nia Schuetzen Club W. O. Hoffman, one
of the new members, surprised his com
rades by taking first 'honors in the
bullseye contest, with the good score of
120 points, his nearest competitor being
J. JL. Utschlg with 200.
George M. Barley, in the pistol-com

THE: SAN FRANCISCO- GALL, .MONDAY; JUNE 19, 1005^
5WALLACE RICE
IGNORANCE OF ONE ANOTHER
ONE of the penalties the inhabitants of a great city pay for. their residence
in a thronging .center of humanity is ignorance, 'more or less complete, of
one another. Even in cases 'where we have'-^ reason Tto .believe that we
know some one metin comparatively recent years particularly well,' we are quite,
without knowledge of his kinsfolk arid connections, through- which it is^ always
possible to obtain new light upon any given' character.' ; ,
How many grown people in this city know. any of the close blood relatives
of their dearest friends? In the country, where associations are generally of
family with family, one knows all his n'eignbors. When yuu i khow a man you
know not only his \u25a0wife, as you are likely to in San Francisco, but his father and
mother, his. wife's father and mother, the. brothers. and sisters of both, even the
uncles and aunts and cousins of both. Knowing : all* of them, you know each
of them the better for the knowledge you have of the others. / ,
You know family, characteristics as such-rthls family is notoriously close
with money; that as notably unable to save;. that is quick to wrath and slow to
forgive; the other good-natured and unwilling to take offense. It "makes-char
acter reading twice as easy. ; : .
If any given employer wished to take a person into intimate relations with
him, his judgment would be twice as valuable to himself if he knew what kind
of parents and cousins and sisters and brothers he has^ vlfv If he" knew the*en
tire family connection well, .he wouid ; have the information gained through con
versation with them concerning every, individual. : , â¢
In the questlonof a partnership, this would be especially valuable. But city
people do not possess it, as a' rule. ;.;; Every man in the city stands on his own
merits and defects, quite regardless of the merits and defects of his kinsfolk..
It. is really astonishingâ the more it is reflected ur>on the more astonishing
it growsâ how little a. way this sort of knowledge goes. We know a man pretty
well, his wife not so well, his children not at allâ and after that all is a : blank.
Most of us moved into the city after we were fully grown, leaving all of
our kinsfolk at the original point of 'departure. * The family' traits that have
persisted through generations are dropped by contact of another kind peo
ple of anothcrsort. It Is ; not longâ and human 'life is very shortâ before we do
not know our own folk, let alone those of the rest. .... .

"Dear Miss Morgan: Lovers see a worthTln each other that others cannot see.
Is the worth really thereâ visible only to the eyes that love? Others will often see
grave faults. Is this -because the imagination is stimulated and Idealize 3. or is it
because love can seejmore than reason, and the worth Is really there? Please tell
your readers what you think about this. . . -
"A. HATCHETT." *
I sincerely believe , that when two hu
man beings love each other each sees the
higher self, the real self, of the otherâ
the self hidden from eyes that do not
view with love's sight. ffiSflffiiwlllT*'Wff
I maintain that love can see more than
reason, because love can see deeper than
reason.
Reason, applied in this sense, is capable
only of surface judgment. Love Is quali
fied to ' look below the surfaceâ beneath
the crustâ far beyond the outer rim of
vision. And it sees a worth that is really
there. â¢
It is impossible to pronounce true judg
ment without love. Every day of our live*
we misjudge the people about us. Wo are
near-sighted, and nothing but love can
remedy the defect." We cannot judge any
man unless wo love him.
Reasonâ the discernment of the* Intellect
-'-sees the ' shell, the : crust, the surface
person, with- his faults, : his limitations,
his ] imperfections, perhaps [ his vices, and
pronounces its own verdict. ;
Through love an entirely different ver
dict is possible/ Love penetrates the outer
disguise and really perceives the poten
tial cod or angel within.
This is not" mere \u25a0\u25a0theoryâ it is truth. If
we\ are to believe anything, "It is just as
iational to believe the evidence of love as
Â»t is to credit the evidence of reason.
Love has its own objective sight, just as
reason . has, and the noble qualities, the
beauties and perfections apparent to love
are just, as real as the imperfections per
ceived by the superficial intelligence we
call reason.
You~ ask iif love discovers this hidden
worth because the- Imagination is'stimu
lated and idealizes. It depends upon
what you mean, by imagination. I , think
what we term ; imagination is " frequently
the objective perception of our higher mmd â our finer brains. "When we say we
Idealizeâ or that our imaginations are stimulatedâ we mean, In fact, that our finer
intelligence is awakened. - Â».
:"-In the sense you imply, love does not imagine " beauties - and good traits In its
object; jit actually sees them.
"- Every person you ! meet is a soul in process of growing to a realization of its
best and highest. No one is already grown. You cannot condemn any living :belng
as unchangeably good or bad. The tastes and tendencies one. has to-day may bÂ«
no part of him in another year. He may outgrow them completely and acquire a
higher order of traits.
At, the core every: human* being, is good. If we believe in God at all, > if we be
lieve ",in" a supreme intelligence that has produced us, we must surely believe that
"Incur real natures we are* all of us goodâ spiritually beautiful and true,
v;, i I believe love enough can transform^ the lowest nature, transmuting Its baser
desires into pure aims and j worthy purposes.
\u25a0-\u25a0 : ' ' ' '*' .'\u25a0 m ' â\u25a0-â¢'"---\u25a0.
HERE is a letter I am particularly glad to answer, as it touches upon a sub
ject which interests thinking people to-day as never beforeâ the. psycholog
ical si do of loveâ its importance as a regenerating and spiritualizing agent.

COMIC OPERA RECIPE.
A very simple and dainty design which, withal, is in the extreme of
.the mode. Is displayed In this simple summer gown of henrletta. The
collar and a shallow yoke are cut in one and unlined. and the hen
rietta part shirred to this with velvet ribbon strappings and pear
shaped lace appliques posed at intervals. These appear again on the
blouse, just above the fitted vetvet belt. The sleeve Is of extremely
moderate style for the present fashions, and is built in so that it runs
up over the shoulder seam to the collar. The lace motifs trim this also,
and there Is a smart little slant at the elbow filled in with gauze rib
bon ruffles that are repeated on the cuff. The skirt is very full and
shirred to "the band; while half way below the knee a very full flounce
is shirred on, the lace appliques being- posed after a fanciful design for
a heading 1 . Three rows of velvet^ribbon trim the hem.
THK MODE VOLUMINOUS.
THERE is only one modern :flat -house
In Philadelphia,^ perhaps half a dbzen
modern /hotels,- and no tenements
such as all other cities have by the , acre.
There is, no large \u25a0 proletariat in the city,
and such as exists Is due to the influx of
derelicts from abroad. As a rule, the
Philadelphian is. w. ell ' employed the year,
round. There are about three hundred
thousand residences! in- .the cityâ more
than in Greater; New 'York and London
combinedâ arid '{most of them are owned
by the I people who live in them. Almost
two, hundred thousand of .them are two
story houses; with six or seven rooms and
a bath, generally a i sizable \u25a0 back yard,
and in the newer portions a little front
yard and* a porch.. Mechanics buy these
houses through : the - building associations
and mortgages from the trust companies.
Such houses cost from two,' to" four v thou
sand dollars; apieceâ the flatter 7' "would
seem like mansions to many. New York
ers. They rent at from $12 to $25 a month
with an average of about-sl6.^ Those who
are i aware \u25a0ot what rents * are/- in *' other
cities can f. see that in this respect the
Fhiladelphian- Is much better off than
most of: his neighbors.
This "insularity, due to the original vil
lage system,: is, enhanced by the home
feeling. Philadelphians,; as a rule,:ans"
sober . and hard^-working men with fam
ilies.; When -a:' man comes home _; from
work it is not '. necessary to fly .-' to : the
nearest saloon, to; getV comfortable Place
to sit. He has his little parlor, his back
yard, or his. front step.. There aro-hun
dred of | miles .'of streets to be , seen on
any summer. night in : Philadelphia* where
the father \ and , mother : sit on the porch
or steps and enjoy the sports of the chil
dren in the streets. r Thc man does not
care for the street corner. The. home
spirit seems to be dominant. If he -were
not comfortable at home, he would go
where he could enjoy himself, and many
of them do. But it ought to be' plain that
people who stick so closely to the hearth
stone are more conservative . than those
who flock out of human .beehives to ., the
streets as soon as they have their meals.
The Philadelphian is called slow because
he is not prone to run off aftÂ«jÂ»some new
Idea. He is like the farmer fn the re
cesses of his homestead, who popders be
fore he act 3 ., Because the home Is so
largely \ developed., and because the city
is- composed almost exclusively of native
Americans and Germans, the women have
a much ; wider 'influence in , Philadelphia
than anywhere else in America, and they
exercoise" it.â From "Philadelphia's Civic
Outlook," by Joseph M. Rogers, in the
American Monthly Review of Reviews.

STREET railway employment in the United States is the sub
ject of a very elaborate study in the latest -bulletin of the
Bureau of Labor. The street car men now form a big host,
and their number is rapidly increasing. The daily safety and con
venience of the people depend so much on them, they work so
continuously in the public view and are so subject to the give and
take of hourly courtesy and criticism, that there are few industrial
classes of men so likely to awaken our interest in their life condition
as affected by society. Aside from its direct appeal in this way, the
study is of value in sociology as an indicator of general industrial
prospects throughout the country.
When we learn that the average wage of these men is from
$2 to $2 24 per day, and that to earn this they must be picked men,
strong and healthy in body and alert in mind, and that in the com T
petition for the places, Â«. sample report, there were forty-one appli-
cations for six situations, that men from both city and country and
of the most varied previous training and employment enter the
service, we plainly see that this $2 per day is a gauge to measure
the value of men who have not mastered some skilled trad,e or pro
fession and found demand for their services therein.
To be acceptable for this workmen must be strictly within
the age limits "of their greatest powers. Some companies demand
a maturity of 30, and some count 45 as old age and unfitness to earn
the wage. The pay is fairly good while it lasts, but to desire to live
longer than 50 would be a rash wish in the breast of a street car
man. The men chosen must be of fairly good stature, and "in the
case of motormen they must have weight. Thus $2 to $2 24 is the
maximum earning power for picked American manhood outside of
skilled trades. A large majority of the men find that sum sufficient
to families.
We are now employing over 140,000 in this service, and no
other country has one-fourth that number^ Their ; condition has
greatly improved over what it was in former years: and' for niuch; of
this the bulletin gives credit to. the trades union; 'The hours used to
be very exhausting, sometimes seventeen ' per v day, 'now (they "are
from nine to thirteen. Since the introduction of . electric lines the
men in the service are of much higher grade. In a majority of the
States laws have been passed: in the interests of the car' menh . The
present tendency is v for the occupation to become more like a regu
lar trade, with a compact body of men working under improved
. conditions. The summing up is that the development "has mani
fested merely a tendency in the direction of amelioration .'-. and \u25a0it
cannot be regarded as a completed process.'', V '
STREET CAR MEN.
EVOLUTION OF A NAME.
A feature of the week was the apathy in the New York stock
market, where the sales fell to the point of stagnation, those on
Thursday being only 133,400 shares, the smallest day's trading this
year. It is not often that Wall street makes such' a slim exhibit,
even during the usual summer lull.
The Pacific. Coast continues to send jn the most cheerful re
ports, owing to its good crop prospects/ the high prices" for most
farm and orchard products, the abundance of money and the spirit
of confidence and optimism apparent everywhere.
WHILE trade conditions continue of a humdrum and every
day character, there are certain underlying elements which
may turn out serious and which serve to render the heavier
financial and mercantile interests cautious. The sudden appearance
of the Moroccan incident and its grave possibilities is one of these,
for if unfortunately France and Germany should. actually become
involved in war there is no knowing what the effect on the money
markets of the world would be. The different financial centers have
been financing Russia and Japan along all right thus far, but with
France and Germany suddenly injected into the situation it would
become more or less serious.
Another condition deserving attention is the domestic money
situation. The plenitude of money gives us a sort of abnormal ease
which may be abruptly and rudely interrupted. New York finan
ciers are pointing out that the Government has now on deposit in
the depository b^nks of the country something like $70,000,000,
which will be withdrawn about the beginning of the fiscal year,
about the time the demands for moving the great crops of the West
begin to come in". No especial stringency isxapprehended, owing to
the immense sums of money on hand all over the country, but it is
anticipated that these withdrawals will be sufficient to check any
large speculative movement in Wall street and to render the heavier
mercantile interests cautious in their operations. The Equitable
squabble, too, while now less febrile than it has been, still acts as
a disturbing and unsettling force in the market for securities, and
by imparting a certain wariness to capital has an 'indirect effect on
general trade. Still another factor which is being watched is an
increasing dullness in the iron and steel trade, as the condition of
this industry is generally accepted as a good barometer to the gen
eral commercial status of the country.
The condition of the cotton crop is likewise having more or
less effect. Theodore Price, the leading cotton operator, who has
for some time been a pronounced bear on the market, has lately
turned bull, and says in explanation of his change in attitude that
he has abandoned his expectations of any substantial, reaction in
the cotton market : that he has just completed a tour of the whole
South and thinks from his observation of the crop conditions that
the crop cannot exceed 11,000,000 bales, and may be nearer 10,000,
000. as there is^serious menace from boll weevil. and tlie possibility
of dry weather in July and August affecting a crop that has no top
root. That others share his opinion is shown by the recent steady
advance in cotton. -rrM
Against these possible adverse conditions, however, the wheat
and corn crop prospects continue good, though during the past
few days the appearance of red and black rust in different sections
and heavy rains throughout the West have cut down the estimates
vi the volume of the former crop. Still, this is the season for crop
scares, and it is pointed out that this is a large country and that
whole sections may experience a curtailment of the crop
and still leave an abundance of grain for domestic use and
export. Another gratifying condition is the increase of $24,000,000
in exports during May, compared with the same month last' year.
The continued gains in the bank clearings, too, -point to a steady
expansion in business, as frequently pointed out of late. The in
crease last week was 21.3 per cent, which is smaller than the recent
average gain, but which is, nevertheless, substantial.
Of the first sixty cities and towns on the list only five show
losses from last year, and they are so small as to hardly deserve at
tention, the heaviest being 10.2 per cent, at* St. Joseph, Mo. The ag
gregate clearings, however, were only $2,372,500,000. The failures
for the week were 229, against 257 for the same week last year. The
railway earnings thus far in June are 8.7 per cent larger than those
ior the same period last year. Mercantile collections are reported
good all over the country.
Activity in building continues everywhere, creating an excel
lent demand for lumber and other structural material. While, n*
before stated, there is a growing dullness in the iron and steel trade,
the mills still have sufficient old orders to keep them running all
summer, and are refusing prompt deliveries on new business. The
flour mills are more or less inactive, waiting for the new crop. The
textile and footwear factories are generally fully employed, and
with the exception of Chicago there are no serious labor disturb
ances anywhere.

At first glance it would seem that he
could hardly have selected a calling more
ill suited to the cultivation of scholarly
tastes. But Hunt knew what he wa3
about. He had his eye on the treasures
of the British Museum. They are ac
cessible only to those who can conduct
their researches by daylight. At night,
\u25a0which is the only time. when most folk
who have to work for a living can find
leisure for study, the great reading room
Is closed. Therefore Hunt decided that
he would earn' his .living by some work
which would give him plenty of daylight
leisure. Because it is such, unpleasant,
messy work, and personal contact with
a chimney-sweep is objectionable to them,
most folk insist ,on having their: chim
neys swept before 'they: turno ut of bed.
As a rule the chimney-sweep's day's
work is done before that of the average
business man begins. It was that con
sideration which made Hunt turn chim
ney-sweep. . \u25a0 -'\u25a0Â«'\u25a0'
He settled in a back street ot Streat
ham, one of ,the districts of London where
most of the inhabitants are fairly well
oft and don't neglect their chimneys. As
soon as his work -was done; he would
change his cloines, give himself a thor
ough washing and hie away to the British
Museum. No one ever recognized in -the
neatly-clad, keen-eyed, clear-skinned vo
racious devourer of books the soot
begrimed individual who devoted the
early morning hours to cleaning Streat
ham's chimneys. ;
When in the navy, voyaging in far
away seas. Hunt had noticed' how con
tact with Europeans caused deterioration
among j savage. 7 races, and "In random'
fashion had speculated upon it a great
deal. When he began reading, for a,pur
pose the subject again attracted him, but
along much broader lines. For. years he
devoted himself to : a study' of the rela
tions between national morals: and "na
tional vigor and vitality. Finding that
much valuable data could be obtained
from French scientific works which had
never been translated into English he at
tended an evening continuation | school
until he had acquired a sufficient mastery
of French to be able to read the French
books dealing; with \ the subject. /\He is
now setting about mastering Greek thor
oughly . that he may read Plato - and
Homer. in the original..
This chimney-sweep scholar is far from
being a mere bookworm. Nature attracts
him as much as does the British Museum.
In the slack ; . season ~ for his ' trade, the
summer time when people need fires only
for cooking, he, mounts "his bicycle and
wanders far over" the - country, content
with plain fare and j humble lodgings and
not above doing an occslonal odd job for
his bed and board. : He has acquired a
good philosophy as well as scholarship,
and has entirely escaped that complaint
which spoils so, many self-made men,the
"swelled head." He sees nothing extra
ordinary in [ what he \ has done.
"With perseverance," he says, "any
one can get. knowledge in these days. It
Is only a question of getting started."
LONDOM, June 18.â There have been
learned blacksmiths besides Elihu Bur
ritt, ''the .. famous-;..- American one; and
learned masons and 1 cobblers even, and
various other humble callings 'have been
associated with scholarly fame, but until
Walter Hunt was discovered j the other
day one never: had heard of a learned
chimney-sweep. Certainly .Hunt; can
claim to be the first member of the sooty
brotherhood who ever published a book.
It was that' which led to his being found
out. "Are We a reclining Nation?" Is
the title v of the work. . â
There can be no doubt that much learn
ing and patient research have been In
volved in its composition. It is brimful
of quotations from ana references to
Latin and Greek authors and modern
physiological experts and bristles with
statistics and figures. '\u25a0' But It is not the
sort of book that attracts the average
reader. It Is hardly likely that copies
enough will be sold to justify Hunt in
abandoning chimney-sweeping for author
ship. However, that does not bother him.
much. Such devotion as he has shown
to learning Is never .inspired by the mere
desire to make It pay.
He is 48 years old, short of figure, gray,
haired and gray bearded, but still strong
and agile. For thirteen years he was a
sailor in the British navy. Then he came
ashore and for a few years was attached
to the London fire brigade, all the mem
bers of which are required to be ex
sailors, because that is supposed to af
ford a guarantee that they are spry on
their legs and good climbers.
It was while in the fire urigade that
the thirst for knowledge seized upon him.
Up' to that time, as he acknowledged, he
had not differed much from the ordinary
man who earns his living by manual toil.
But when the thirst had once ' gripped
him he found that there was no getting
rid of it. He had to gratify It or submit
to having life made a grievous burden
to him. It was that he might find oppor
tunities for study that he turned chim
ney-sweeper.

"We need a great free' museum in Los
Angelesâ not merely to exhibit, but to
save, thÂ« . history, science, art and ro
snance of California and the Southwest.
The museums of Germany, England, and
even Spain, eend costly expeditions to
carry these things off from under our
noses. France has laden eighteen Bhlps
with our treasures. The great institu
tions of Boston. New York, Chicago.
Philadelphia, are taking from us, by the
carload, what they think valuable to ed
ucatÂ« their children. Even Turkey is
â¢skinning our country* On President
Roosevelt's phrase) for that wonderful
museum in Constantinople.
"Isn't it time for us of California to
In regard to the erection of It, listen
to what Mr. Lummis says:
L.TTHHIS' IDEA.
Now comÂ«s Mr. Lummis with a propo
sition equally patriotic, equally sane,
equally necessary to our future reputa
tions for intelligence â the creation of the
Southwest Society of the Archaeological
Institute of America, now In its nine
teenth month, and thus past the drool
ing and teething and colicky period. .;- : '_
The society is organized in Los An
geles, with its headquarters there. And
on this score, let it be said to the honor
of Los Angeles, that it is about the only
city in the State that can round up
enough, public-spirited people to form
*>ueh an uncommercial society and who
will "pay up" to keep It going withont
public dunning.
The object of the society is, primarily,
to establish in Los Angeles a California
museum, where would be gathered and
safeguarded all that pertains to early
California that is now lying around loose.
It would "catch Its archaeology alive,"
which it is already doing In saving the
eld folk songs of California. This is done
through the medium of the phonograph,
ir.to which ajred Indians sing, the last
remnants of their race. So, too, are the
exquisite songs of the prepastoral days,
the sweet love songs of the caballeros,
and the plaints of scnoritas, who knew so
well how to pour out the exultation and
the tumult of the soul in song.
Already has the young society done
somethingâ it's a way with these Lummis
enterprises. He touches the foreheads of
the faithful with the divine fire, and lo!
âthe thing goes. Last year he suggested
the wisdom of purchasing the Caballeria
collection of historic paintings from the
old missionsâ which -were quite probably
stolen from the churches during the era
of secularization â and, forsooth, it was
done.
These are now the priceless possessions
cf Los Angeles, and blessings on her
people for their enterprise.
Like-wise' has the society a valued pos
ression in the Palmer-Campbell collec
tion of California archaeology, which, with
the Caballeria. paintings, and the 600 rec
ords of almost extinct folk-songs, is a
worth-while nucleus for the proposed
museum. <
CALIKORMA MUSEUM.
He points out to us the honorable
monuments of a heroic past and urges
i heir safeguarding for the children of the
futureâ for the millions who will some
day make their homes in California, "in
our neighbors' fields."
As is well known, it was due to Mr.
Lummis' efforts that the Landmarks Club
of Southern California was formed and
under whose direction it has accomplished
ibe stupendous task of safeguarding
Mission San Fernando Key, the asisten
oia of Pala, and portions of Missions San
Juan Capistrano and of San Diego.
It was through his virile pen and pow
erful personality that he caught the ear
of the Southern Callforniansâ most of
whom, by the way. are Californians by
t hoice rather than by birthâ and created
a sentiment among them that, measured
commercially, stands for something over
$6000. And this is the type of sentiment
that countsâ the sentiment that touches
the pocket. It was through this fund that
the work of safeguarding the Southern
California missions has been accom
plished, and most of it, mark you, con
tributed by imported Californians.
The message comes from Southern Cal
ifornia and emanates from the brain of
that leading Califorr.ian, Charles F.
Lummis, who has done more to foster an
Intelligent love of State than all the so
callcJ patriotic societies in it put to
gether. And the reason therefor is plain
âhe lays down for us in simplest fashion
tile history of the big West, the part it
has played in the development of the na
tion, the achievements of her Spanish
j>ioneers and the Argonauts that fol
lowed, and the part it is yet to play in
the unfolding of the great commercial
drarca of the world. He gives us reasons
for our patriotism.
Listen, all ye clubwomen who are
really in earnest in your patriotism and
\u25a0who seek for something more than skim
milk scholarship In your club work-^listcn
to this niessiige to Intelligent Califyr
nian*âtlctsn't this mean you?
, If this be true, and there's no reason to
doubt its correctness, tho outlook for a
cleaner, city morally and physically is
not encouraging.
The State Board of Charities and Cor
rections informed us a few days ago that
there were 4SS boys and girls in the re
form schools of California; 2612 men and
women In the State prisons; 5796 In the
insane hospitals and 637 in the Home of
the Feeble-Minded.
Now, if it be true that right education
is the only rational cure for crime, and
that crime is largely productive of insan
ity and of feeble intellect, with these fig
ures confronting us, can we be too vigi
lant In our enforcement of the compulsory
education; law â that the children now
growing to maturity shall be normal,
morally and physically?
The school authorities are bending thetr
best efforts to round up every urchin of
school age in town, and when the schools
convene in August, it Is. believed that the
rodeo will have produced a good effect.:
What of it that the unusual -activity
among the educational heads is due to a
scarcity of fundsâ that the State. moneys
were apportioned on the dally average
attendance, rather than on the census
count? . , w
What matters it. Indeed, if the children
are gathered up and led to good citlzen-
The motive. In this Instance, is ' not
It's the result that counts.
It is declared by the school authorities
that there are , 20,000 children between 5
and 14 years not attending school In San
Francisco. ; ?:/-fc
And there were toasts, too â clever
toasts, 'tis eaid. and toasts that weren't
gleaned from betwixt the slabs of an en
cyclopedia. These ranged widely as to
matter, as you will observe by the titles:
The "Greeting," "Our Members, "Flow
ers," "Are Clubs Trumps?" "The Psychic
Moment," "Art," "School Gardens,"
"Sensitive Souls" and "Life In the Open."
Following these came a clever little
story written and read by the honored
\u25a0guest of the day, who also responded in
charming fashion to the greeting of af
fection bestowed upon her.
Altogether It was a notable day.
The decorations, under the direction of
Miss Jennie Long, were especially apt
and attractive, great masses .of oak
branches and ferna forming an effective
background for the pink blossoms that
nodded from everywhere.
Pink sweet peas graced the table, while
at each place lay a bunch of pink carna
tions tied with green ribbon, upon which
was written the name of each guest and
the date.
And when the clubs convene in Septem
ber for their winter's activities that is
the name by which the league shall be
knownâ perhaps. That the passing of its
identity as a corporate body might be
properly celebrated, and that its well-be
loved founder and president, Mrs. Lovell
White, be fittingly honored, the league
gave a breakfast on Saturday afternoon
at the California Hotel. f;r,: : .;r.
The Outdoor Art League is no longer a
corporate body, having become two
months ago a department of the Califor
nia Club, Its official name now being "The
Outdoor Art League Department of the
California Club." -

"There are many things to be done in
Southern California, and many people to
do them; but this society is attending to
those things which must be done at once,
if ever. For this it has enlisted the most
serious forces, individual and collective,
local and national; and it will do its work
now as this community will demand that
such woxk shall be doneâ up to the strict
est standards of scholarship. It asks
your co-operation."
Here's success to Mr. Lummis In his
splendid endeavor to lead the people of
California to a realization of their civic
and national duties! And here's to the
enterprise of Southern California, where
the voice of the prophet is hearkened
unto, and the "knocker" thriveth not.
And while there are those who would
rather see the great historical museum
of California located in San Francsico,
let the clubwomen and others hereabouts
get together and help Los Angeles perfect
her plans, now that so brave a start has
been made and such energetic effort put
forth.
"The Southwest Society knows what It
wants and how to get it. .Its plans are
maturedâ not visionary. It means to have
the noblest piece of architecture in Cali
fornia for its museumâ and it has already,
owned by It or pledged, over 550,000 worth
of exhibits proper to be put in that build
ing. It has been digesting its plans by
meetings nearly every week for eighteen
months and in consultation with the fore
most experts In America.
"At two years old the Southwest So
ciety will have the largest membership
of any of the fifteen affiliations of the
institute, and therefore the largest rep- J
lesentation in this council. The Archaeo
logical Institute has already appropriated
nearly J2400 to help us to build our mu
seum. This !s the first time thÂ« Institute
has taken such action, and tho first time
that Los Angeles has received such a
gift from outside.
save something for our children? It must
be done quickly, or never.
"The Southwest Society is going to
build that museumâ beginning right away.
It \u25a0will be no .amateur r:or provincial
thing. Its standards will be set and
scaled by the most critical scientific body
in this country, the Archaeological Insti
tute of Americaâ which was done more
than any other organization to make tho
art of Greece and Rome familiar to
Americans.

is due largely to the Interest which Lily,
Duchess of Marlborough, has taken in the
work. House hunting,' which most folk
regard " : as an unmitigated nuisance, the
American Dowager Duchess really en
joys. As it is a fad, which of necessity
she must find comparatively few oppor
tunities to Indulge in on her own account,
her services are always at the disposal
of her friends, particularly those from
the other isida oX the Atlantic. Her se
lections are always well made. She
knows Mayfalr and Belgravia as few
women know these fashionable* quarters,
and not the/*most wily of house agents
or landlords can impose upon her. When
she appears on the scene it Is no use
holding out for fancy prices.
. : Her knowledge of what constitutes a
desirable residence is not confined to mere
externals. In 7 the Important matter, of
plumbing', and ventilation she Is some
thing of an expert. Among the less
scrupulous class of agents and landlords
who hava found that her knowledge of
sanitation exceeds their ' powers of de
ception the sobriquet of the "Sanitary In
spector" has been bestowed on her. She
has all the London County Councirs by
laws and regulations with respect to con
struction and drainage at her finger ends,
and where she discovers tnat they have
been disregarded insists that they shall
be conformed . ' with under penalty of
lodging information against the delin
quent. '
Some house agents who do not like her
critical methods say that she charges a
commission making investigations,
but this is not true. She spends both
time and money freely on her fad. That
she: is possessed of exquisite taste in the
matter of furniture and house decorations
is sho.wn by her own residence. Deepdene,
n_ear Dorking, which she has transformed
into one of the most beautiful homes in
the country.
Though thricÂ© riarried and thrice wid
owed she is still only In niddle life and
looks younger than she really Is. . From
her first husband, an American, she
gained riches; from her second, rank, and
from her third. Lord William Beresford.
a very complete. but brief domestic hap
piness. It was by thf* third marriage
she had her only child, a boy, and now
the idol of her life.

rVAZTt YOUNG GIRLS. j
Must Have Hlsbt Food AVTiUe Growing. \u25a0
Great care should be taken at the
critical period when the young 'girl is
Just merging; into womanhood that the
diet shall contain all that is upbuilding, j
and nothing harmful. !
At that age the structure Is being
formed and if formed of a healthy, j
sturdy character, health and happiness j
\u25a0will follow; on the other hand unhealthy i
cells may be built In and a sick condi- j
tion slowly supervene, which, if not j
checked, may ripen into a chronic dis-
ease and cause life-long suffering.
A young lady says:
"Coffee began to have such an effect
on my stomach a few years ago that
I was compelled to Quit using it It
brought on headaches, pains in my
muscles and nervousness.
"I tried to use tea in its stead, but
*ound Its effects even worse than those
I suffered from coffee. Then for a long
time I drank mUk alone at my meals,
but it never helped me physically, and
at last It palled on me. A friend came
to the rescue with the suggestion that
I try Postum Coffee.
"I did so. only to find at first that
I didn't fancy It. But I. had, heard of
bo many persons who had been bene- \u25a0
(ited by its use that I persevered, and \u25a0
when 1 had It brewed right . found .It j
gratÂ« r ul Jn flavor and soothing and
strengthening to my stomach. I can
find no words to express my feeling of
what I owe to Postum Food Coffee!
""In every respect it has worked a j
vronderful * improvementâ the head- j
iolics. nervousness, the pains In my .
side and back, air the distressing symp- ,
Â»'/â¢â¢â¢Â»Â»Â« yielded to the magic power of j
r/s.tum. My brain seems also to share i
= tfr betterment of my physical condi- ;
tin: It seems keener, more i'*rt and (
VJc-hter" I' am, fn short, in better <
health now than I ever was before, and I
I am sure I owe it to the use of your j

E. H. Mulcaater, who has been called
the father of American coursing:, was
found dead at an early hour yesterday
morning at Union CourslnÂ« s Park. HÂ©
died of natural causes." Mulcaater was
born in the north of England in ISSO.
He came of a good old family and was
a veterinary surgeon by profession.
His father, who died recently, was a
famous cross-country rider and trained
one of the winners of the Liverpool
Grand National. The son also rods
many \u25a0 races between the tln?s until in
creasing weight kept him on tae
ground.
He had no equal as a trainer of grey
hounds. "When he came to America
about fifteen years ago he bought a
stock farm at Fox Lake, Michigan. Ha
turned his attention to greyhounds
while located in that place, and it
was â his stock from which devel
oped the best American strains. Sir
Robert Jardlne, an English sports
man, was one of his friends. He sent
him the greyhounds Glenkirk, Dover,
Gilda. the grand dam of Roman Athlete,
and others. He won the first American
"Waterloo cup in 1895 with Gilkirk, by
Glenkirk-Gllda, while his greyhound
Diana was runner-up. When he cama
to California with"a string of hounds
he continued his successes. He won the
first John Grace cup stake with Fear
Not, Kirkglen. from hl3 kennels, beins
runner-up. He bred and owned Hot
Stuff, Hadlwist and many others. He
revolutionized training methods here.
Up to the last he was a hard worker,
being out on the road at daybreak with
whatever Uogs were under his care.
The funeral will take . place to-mor
row, the Interment being at Mount Oli
vet Cemetery.

Three of these volumes that will Inter
est the laymen most, owing to their cilrl
ous and \ beautiful j illustrations, are - the
"Isolarl In Versi," printed in Venice^ln
1478, - the volume being the \ first speciar
atlas of the Mediterranean. The Mediter
ranean to the cartographer meant Italy
evidently, , for the map shows the penin
sula dotted with little castles and single
trees. The "History of Troy," printed In
Paris In 1497, -contains- eighty exquisite
miniatures, this : particular book having
been a presentation/copy, to the French
Kng Charles VIII. A copy of "Potrarch."
printed In Venice in 14S8. has six engrav
ings, beautifully colored by hand, of Bot
ticelli's "Triumphs." The book lies open
at the "Triumph of Love." The last rec
ord price of the "Lactantus Opera," print-,
ed at the { monastery of Sublaco in 1465,
is 1540, ' and that was obtained at the
Ives sale, fourteen years ago.â Chicago
Chronicle.
Two other rare old German books are a
"Constitution of. cement V." printed by
Peter Schoeffer in : Mentz In 1467, and
which has all the; paragraphs : marked
with the same sign In use to-day. One
of the oldest of the sources of "Parsifal"
Is a copy of the first edition of Wolfram
yon - Eschenbach's "Tyturell." printed in
1477.-;?-'. a : :â¢,.- .:.- â¢ â¢ \u25a0 â¢:\u25a0*<*?\u25a0
-It Is the \u25a0;\u25a0 Latla Psalter of 1459, printed
by Fust&Schoeffer, andis the second
printed book known to bibliophiles bearing
a date.'.; lt is one of a collection of early
printed books owned by J. Pierpont Mor
gan now on exhibition in â¢ the Columbia
library.:;: It cost Mr. Morgan $26,000, he
having purchased |it from | Quaritch, the
London : dealer,- : about four years ago.
Quaritch bought it at the Thorold sale in
London -for Â£4590 ($24,750), about twenty
years ago, and kept -it until Mr. Morgan
came along and purchased it at the figure
mentioned, which practically amounted to
a loss for. the dealer when the matter of
interest is concerned.
:The extraordinary* value of the book is
due fto I two things^-first, : the extremely
limited' number \u25a0 of copies of . it in exist
ence, thirteen in all, eleven of which are
owned by .'European libraries. The Mor
gajr'copy Is printed on vellum, the page
lying opened showing- only the slightest
marks of age,' and : is bound in red mo
rocco.' It contains the first printed text of
the Athanasian creed and the initial let
ters "are printed In red and blue inks.
These are said to <be the : most beautiful
specimens of the printed/letters in exist
ence. AH of the capital letters are print
ed in red ink. and the large- initial letter
at the head of the first page is printed in
blue with a design of a running hound
and flowers in white. Across the top of
the page is also. a staff with the notes of
the Gregorian scale. . *
Another gem to be seen here is a copy
of the Gutenburg-Fust Bible, the* first
printed book, and usually called the Alaza
rln Bible, on account of its having been
found in the library of the Cardinal of
that name. Mr. Morgan's copy is on vel
lumand:contains jonly. the Old Testament.
"The last record -p rice for the complete
copy of this work is ; $20,000. â¢ In addition
to this vellum copy Mr. Morgan owns one
printed on ; paper." Although noneÂ»of the
other books here are held at Buch sensa
tional ' values !as â¢ these two, there -Is a
copy; of "Janua's Catholicon'V that sold
for $2000 at the last public sale, twenty
flve years ago. This is, regarded as the
finest book Issued j from Gutenberg's sec
ond press, and was printed in Mentz in
1460. The title' of the:book Is written in
ink that has faded only a little, and the
Initial letters are in red and blue, | and in
green and white.
In a case in one of the small rooms in
the - library of Columbia University, there
Is lying an open volume that is. the cost
liest book in existence. - V "i. ?-

Jeres de la â¢ Frontera has I a population
of 65,000, and Is the center of the sherry
wine making trade. There are many rich
people here, -worth from $500,000 "to $5,000,
000. - The city has hundreds of very old
and large, storehouses, containing, it is
said, enough sherry wine to . supply t the
world's demand for twenty-five years.
There are fifty large firms here which
ship wine, to more than two hundred im
porters in the United States. Last year
there were sent to the United' States over
500,000 gallons of sherry, Â»the shipments
ranging In valire from $100 to $3000 each,
and the total' value being $500,000. \u25a0__
\u25a0 All the money transactions of this busi
ness are through London banks. There
is not a bank In Jeres that will buy or
sell a draft on the United States. A
branch of the Bank of Spain and two pri
vate banks do business here, but it > is
impossible to sell a draft 'on the United
States Treasury. This is an anomalous
condition not to Ibe found elswhere, and
offers a splendid opening for a discount
and exchange bank, and bankers in the
United States ought to know It. In, New
York â¢ $100 in gold buys a draft on Spain
for 550 silver pesetas, but in Cadiz It re
quires 725 dilver pesetas to buy $100 on New
York, a difference of 185 pesetas for ex
change, or over $26 difference In $100.
'\u25a0 There are no wholesale depots here | for
any kind of goods or manufactures, nor

While Policeman Nelson was practicing
the . Icangaroo walk recently adopted by
the police force along Kearriy street
Saturday night he saw half a dozen Plaza
habitues, shot suddenly from the". door of
"Dutch" Schmittie's saloon. They alighted
in various ungraceful postures, upon the
hard pavement. . Before one of them could
rise something resembling a white-head
torpedo In . a hurry plunged out after
them.
Before Officer Nelson' could move the
hoboes were scattered north, * east, south
and west by their pursuer. When the
smoke of the battle had cleared away the
destroying demon resolved itself into a
black and white goat.
"Ba-a, said the animal, which in goat
talk stands for banzai, and the victorious
animal began to chew pensively on the
cover of a municipal garbage can. -V /.\
"Move on," said Patrolman Nelson. ..
The goat stepped three paces Xp the
rear and the policeman intrenched him
self behind a telegfaph pole. - - \u25a0 -
At this juncture Schmittie stepped out
of the steam beer emporium. "Louie
come a raus," he ordered. "Vas iss? You
don't know Policeman Nelson yet,- vat?"
"Louie" ambled back into the saloon
and slunk behind the bar. "Oxcoose him,"
said Schmittie apologetically. "He vos
my bouncer yet, but he hasn't learned all
about the business. He wants to bounce
everybody."
"What was doing Just before the bat
tle?" asked the- policeman. "
"Veil, I have an opening," said Schmit
tie. "I ask dose ; bums to have a drink.
They eat all my lunchâ efery tarn thing.
Himmel, how the stuffâ but that is all
right, it is an opening "yet n ' ' '
"Bretty soon yon fellow. he says, 'I'm
boiEoned. There Is analine dye in this
sidsige. Goot-by boys,' and he lay's down
on the floor.
"Another yon says, 'There is hair oil in
the sauerkraut. I feel whiskers growing
in my Interior. I am a dead man.*' *.
"The next one says, 'The 'bretzels were
made of sugar pine. I've swallowed . a
plank.' \u25a0 Und they all make a freshness.
"Then I call Louis. Raus mlt 'em,
Louie," I say, "und Louie he get busy.
He is a good bouncer, Louie, vat?" "
The Amalgamated Plaza- Hoboes have
boycotted' Schmittie's.

PREVIOUS .ISSUES.
The question naturally arises, ".Why
should Admiral Sampson be honored by
a place on the stamps rather than.Ad
miral Dewey?' The explanation is simple.
The policy of the Government does not
permit the placing of : portraits .of f per
sons "still living upon postage stamps. The,
scheme" of the Insular .Bureau contem
plated '-, representation ion .the' series . of
stamps of American .'officers who partici
pated in the land and sea - operations
which' resulted in .the acquisition , of tne
Philippines, and Admiral Sampson was
the : only .' commanding officer \u25a0; of â¢ high
grade not now living. ;_
\u25a0The placing of Franklin' and Washing
ton 'on tne ' stamps . of ; the Philippines ' is
also a bit of ' sentiment. ? The \ first two
postage stamps ever issued by the United
States Government were the 5-cent face
of Franklin and the 10-cent face of Wash
ington in' 1847. T SineÂ© that date these two
faces '\u25a0 have, appeared on -every series "of
postage stamps issued, and It Is fitting
that they should now be continued on the
stamps of the , colonies. \u25a0 ,- "
Postage* stamps have been In use in the
Philippines since 18547U They wore 2 Span
ish stamps until' the United States took
charge in 1898, since whicn time the United
States stamps \ with -the word /.'Philip
pines" ' printed diagonally, across the face
of the stamp have been used; ,
SAMPSON ALSO HONORED.
Twenty-six centavosâ Bust of Carriedo,
the Spanish philanthropist, whose bene
factions ' provided Manila v with its first
water supply. \. , \ ;
Thirty centavos â Biist of Benjamin
Franklin. -. -â¢-
One, two, four and' ten pesos bear the
coat of arms of the Filipinos, having no
portraits. .
- Special, delivery.: stampâ Figure of a
Filipino messenger boy at one end of the
stamp; the famous. Mount Mayon.at the
oth,er end.
The new series of stamps for the Philip
pines will consist of the same number and
denominationsâ expressed in centavosâ as
the current issue of United States stamps.
The designs .will be as follows: ." '
.Two centavos (1 cent)â Bust of \ Rlzal,
the idol of the Filipinos, who was execut
ed by the Spaniards because of his activ
ity in fighting for his country's freedom.
This stamp will carry the bulk of Philip
pine domestic mail. - â¢ \u25a0â¢\u25a0â¢.\u25a0\u25a0

Now McKinley's face will appear on

At the time of his death the Post-,
ofllce Department had under considera
tion a . new series of stamps and im
mediately there developed a strong
sentiment in. favor of honoring Mr. Mc-
Kinley with a place on one jof | the de
nominations. This â¢ could not be done
without displacing Washington, Frank
lin, Lincoln or Grant, provided McKin
ley was to have a place on a stamp of
general use. \u25a0\u25a0'": \u25a0.'.- ;
In view of the fact that Franklin's
portrait had appeared on our stamp of
lowest value from the time of. the issue
of our first stamps, and Washington
had always occupied a similar position
on the stamp carrying domestic letter
mail, it waa decided not to disturb
them. Then there was serious dis
cussion of .the proposition to issue a
mourning; stamp bearing , the* head of
McKinley, but this was also abandoned.
BEAR McKIJiLBY'S PACE.
For sentimeritar reasons : this ;new
issue of Philippine stamps will possess
great-, interest for the" people of >*the
United 3 States, although they will' not
be' available for postage here any more
than ; are 'i Cuban stamps. Upon ,; six of
the- denominations will appear\u25a0**por
traits 'of distinguished citizens â¢of . the
United States. ;
The four -N:entayo, \ corresponding â¢to
our 2-cent stamp, will. bear the photo
graph of 3Villiam McKlnley. ;This will
be the first time the face of; President
McKinley has had a place on a postage
stamp.
The. gift of a new kind of money
from Uncle Sam furnished the 'Filipinos*
with substantial grounds for. a "grand
celebration last .Fourth of July. .This
Fourth of ' July the Filipinos' will â¢ have
another cause" for Jubilation. '" -
' On that . day they will be r supplied
with a . new, 'and distinctive .series 'of
postage stamps of all: denominations^
This will mark an epoch inUhe" history
of 'the: islands'.' 'They .'\u25a0will be the first
real Filipino postage stamps ever; used.

FORMALLY ENTERED 'ON 'HIS
PRIESTLY CAREER YESTERDAY.,
I A large congregation .at yesterday
morning's service at the Howard street
Methodist Episcopal Church, was deep
iy impressed with the strongly pa
triotic, utterances of the . Rev. A. C.
Bane, D. D., whose subject was "A
Bound From Bunker or the Chris
tian's Duty to the Nation." The church
was \u25a0 handsomely decorated with the
American flag. -â¢ .
'.*,- After an introduction touching on the
battle" of Bunker Hill and its^ influence
in : securing -the independence of \u25a0 the
colonies. Dr. Bane said:
â¢ This nation .was . founded by Christian pat
riot? and Indeed a Christian nation. A na
tion's security, and strength is in its best citi
zens. \u25a0\u25a0 By the unanimous verdict of .the civil
ized world the. true Christian , makes the best
and most desirable citizen. â¢.
The Christian has national as well as per
sonal and religious obligations; If he falls to
mÂ«et them he is recreant -to a sacred trust.
I The Christian should mold the spirit and pol
icies of the nation. *
This : nation stands for the equality of all
before the; law and the Christian should be thÂ©
first to champion that equality. . '

The impaneling of a jury for the sec
ond trial of Minnie Adams on a charge
of murder will commence .in Judge
Lawlor's court this morning. At the
first trial six years ago the jury
brought in a verdict of murder in the
first degree, with the penalty of im
prisonment for life. A motion for a
new trial was denied? by Judge Lawlor
and an appeal was taken to the Su
preme Court. That court granted a
new trial on the ground" that the Jury
while considering the verdict was, al
lowed to separate.
The prisoner was accused of causing
the death of her illegitimate son, John
Richard Gray, then 2 years 2 months
old, by compelling it to drink carbolic
acid at her father's home. 117 Parker
avenue, on March 13, 1899.' She was
arrested on information given by. Wil
son Gray, the father of the child, to
Captain Duke, who at that time was a
sergeant In that- district The trial
lasted over two weeks and on July 31
the Jury, brought in. the verdict of mur
der in the first degree and oq Septem
ber 15 following sentence was 'passed
upon her. She has been In the Branch

Hyman Bloch, the husband, says he Is
a theatrical man, but has not been
working for some time. His wife does
not repent her act. She said: "I do not
want to live. I have led a wicked life,
and once a girl is bad she can never
lead a good life Again."
Mrs. Bloch. has been separated from
her husband for some time past. Two
days ago he came to her with the mes
sage that her mother was dead in New
York, ishe immediately telegraphed her
father and asked him if she should not
go home.- He replied by wire that he
did not want her there. The little wo
man, who admits that she has led a.
somewhat wayward life, brooded over
the message and finally despondency
got the best of her. Her husband came
into the room to try to effect a recon
ciliation. She asked him to get her a
glass of water, saying she wanted to
take a dose of medicine. He procured
the liquid and she tossed off the lauda
num and fell in a faint on the floor.

that her father did not care for her.

TRIES TO TAKE LIFE
Because "Jim" Plzzaro, able-bodied
mariner, could not comprehend the steer
ing gear of the safety bicycle he ran
afoul of an automobile near the corner of
Page and Stanyan streets yesterday. The
benzine propelled craft caught the cycle
amidships and Pizarro was knocked in
sensible. He was taken to the Park
Emergency Hospital, where he was re
suscitated by Dr. Glover.
The collision is graphically described by
"Jack" Hogan, shipmate of Pizarro:
"We left the J. D. Peters last night
with full pay. We slung our hammocks
atâ well, that's neither here nor there.
This afternoon we chartered a couple of
those bicycles from some land pirate.
"We started west with a good breeze
behind and everything salubrious. Jim he
was a little wobbly on the starboard tack,
but there wasn't no need of taking j
soundings until one of them chug-chug
things puts round the point before the
wind with all sail set.
" 'Ahoy:' says I. 'Take the staxboard
tack.'
" 'Chug-chug,' says the kerosene craft.
" 'Port your helm,' I sings out to Jim.
â¢For Gord's sake, port your helm.'
"With that Jim reaches behind and, of
"With that Jim reaches for the helm,
but misses connections. Naturally this
here torpedo-boat destroying son-of-a
sea-cock catches him amidships, and it
locks as though I loses my shipmate.
"But the chug-chug craft heaves to and
we fetches him here."
"Where was he hit?" asked Dr. Glover.
The loquacious mariner looked at the
matron and blushed.
"Abaft on the starboard side," he whis
pered hoarsely.
"Which?" queried Dr. Glover. "Come
again."
"He was struck bechune Page and -Fell
street." explained Policeman Devline,
who had brought the disabled mariner to
the "Sick Bay."
Examination showed that Plzzaro was
suffering more from shock than anything
else. The automobile was driven by D.
Ltbby Jr - '
As Mayor Schmitz has signed the
I budget for the niext fiscal year, which
I Includes an appropriation to meet the
{expense of increasing the detective
force from fifteen to twenty- five men,
in compliance with a provision of the
charter, much speculation is rife in the
department as to who the lucky ones
will be to receive the increased salary
of $50 per month. The appropriation
will take effect on July 1, . and Chief
Dinan will in a few days announce the
names of the new detective sergeants.
i As there have been rumors that some
men who are doing patrol duty, notably
Commissioner Reagan's son, would be
among the ten, - the Chief was .asked
yesterday if there was -any truth in
the rumors. He replied that there was
no truth in them and. that. the ten men
would be selected from those who are
now doing detective duty. He added
that the names would not be given out
till shortly before July 1.
There are ten men at police head
quarters doing detective duty who have
been drawing the pay of a patrolman.
They are S. V. Bunner, John B. Freel,
Charles H. 'Taylor, Harry P. Braig,
Duncan Matheson, G. F. Mulcahey. T.
J. Coleman. D. G. Bell, T. J. Bailey and
R. M. Silvey, besides T. A. Atchison and
T. L. Wolters, who are identified with
the Identification Bureau. There are
also ten men doing detective duty at
outside stations. They are T. F. Cori
lon and James McGowan at the Har
bor station, James Regan- and .Patrick
O'Connell, at the Southern station; R.
F. Graham and W. H. Harrison, at the
Seventeenth street station; James B.
Cottle and P. J. Mitchell, at the City
Hall station, and H. C. Smith and ,
Joseph H. Gorham, at the Golden Gate
Park station. That makes a total of
twenty-two from whom the ten will be
selected. The ten who are doing duty
at headquarters expect to be the lucky
ones, as they are under the immediate
supervision of Captain Burnett, the
others having to report to the cap
tain of their district, but some of them
will be disappointed. The Identification
Bureau is also under Captain Burnett's
supervision, and Atchison and Wolters
think they have as good a claim for
recognition as the other ten.

It is stated on good authority that
Governor Pardee is at the back of the
expose of the alleged rottennessin the
methods of the State Board of Dental
Kxaminers and that he. has expressed a
willingness to assist in the thorough
investigation that jjj is planned. | . The
charges made by Drs. ; Russell Cool and
John ;M. Dunn ; against Drs. â¢ Mayhew.
Baird, White; Howard and .Herrick
have brought a general '. denial from
the men accused. , . . ; : -.'.
Drs. Dunn and Cool, who have en
gaged State Senator Lukens; as .their
attorney, are already taking action to
prevent any changing of the records of
the board or their possible "loss."' The
men who bring the charges said prior
to their departure for Los Angeles,
where the second series '.of /, examina
tions will ; be held, beginning this
morning: "We do not intend that any
more of Baird's mutilation and, dis
tortion of. the records shall take place.
"We depend upon , the records .of , \ tne
board to a certain extent as^ evidence
of some of the charges v.*e have made.
They must be kept inviolate ; until the
conclusion of this investigation."
Dm. Dunn and Cool . iay .that they
n -111 sliww that Drs. Baird and Herrick
have taken thousand* of dollars .from
the board* funds without -warrant.
Drs. Mayhew, White 'and Howard j are
said to have supported Herrick and
Baird In their alleged grafting; I meth
ods and are charged with conspiracy.
DrÂ«. Dunn and Cool ttaid In regard to
this matter: "We have at all times
been In the minority. Every effort on
our part to prevent grafting has met
with the opposition of the , majority.
Saturday last, when We were about to
precipitate , the charges, we were .out
voted on the luatter of an adjournment
to Los Angeles." . . * . \u25a0 ,
In upholding the charges: of pro
miscuous granting of temporary li
censes by Dr. Baird, the following af
fidavit was^secured from Dr. F.. .H.
Richmond of Chico: â¢ "I did not take a
written examination and was- only
asked a few questions. I showed a
diploma and State certificate, paid my
$5 and was assuredby Dr. Baird-that
I was all; right until; the next regular
'examination." \u25a0* â¢ .*â¢' \u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0\u25a0 ':. â¢â¢.
bowrrs finds;; it easy.
Hero is what Dr. Urban | Bowers, a
dentist practicing. at 10 Kearny street,
swears, in an affidavit, Dr. Baird issued
him a temporary license upon: "Board
of Registry, secretary's' office,,Haver
hill, Mass., March 3, 1904. Dr. Urban
Bowers, Sonora, Cal.â Dear Doctor: It
is required by the rules ,'of the board
that all applicants for duplicate certifi
cates be accompanied, with a sworn
statement of the loss of. the .original
and a fee of one dollar, -when anaf
fidavit attesting the granting of'. the
original certificate will be granted. '" G.
E. Mitchell, secretary, p*er,'M'." . .
The above letter meanti almost ! noth
ing, yet Dr. Baird granted Dr. Bowers
a temporary license to practice den
tistry. Another dentist in- Berkeley was
granted a license without any creden
tials, or without the. usual examination
required by law.
Drs. Bowers "and Richmond . were
loth to make affidavits. :i They feared
that they would fail when ' they took
the examination for permanent license
last week in this city, and cited the
alleged statement made by Dr. Howard
of Los Angeles that "we* do not want
any more dentists in California, there
are enough here now,"', as proper
grounds for their fears. They were as
sured that all fairness would be given
them in their examinations. . .-. . .
Drs. Dunn and Cool will request that
the examination papers held by' the dif
ferent members of the board, who each
have special subjects to examine upon,
shall be correctedor submitted to the
whole board," so that no failures on ac
count of the; alleged. 4 restriction -con
spiracy shall be .recorded.;
In contrast; to, the "easy manner' in
which Richmond and .',Bowers "secured
licenses is 'the way ( in Jwhich T. R.
"Woolard.was examined by, Baird," and
subsequently refused a" license. Wool
ard alleged that,' he ,was.denied'a'tem
porary, license^ . after..' having; passed a
rigid and impractical examination be
fore D>r. Baird. .: He-.and; others charge
that Dr. Baird had issued temporary
licenses to certain 'applicants without
first having subjected' them" to" an ex
amination as to their" qualifications, as
required by the State dental law.
