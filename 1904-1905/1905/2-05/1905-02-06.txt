Bnd three of them were caught. The

NEW YORK, Feb. 5â Christopher
Smith, or "Sanrock," who is locked up
at police headquarters, charged with
being the perpetrator of many startling
robberies in private residences within
the past few weekÃ, made a confession
to Acting Inspector O'Brien of the de
tective bureau to-day.
Smith declared that he had not
worked for plunder, but merely for the
enjoyment he got out of the excitement
incident to the robberies. He confessed
that he had been interested in the ex
ploits of Western bandits and that he
had tried to emulate their example. The
character of Raffles, he declared, also
had given him ideas, and he had at
tempted to follow out this example. He
said that it would have been the easiest
thing in the world for the police to cap
ture him on various occasions, but that
no attempt had been made to follow
him after he left the house he entered
except in one instance. He declared
confidently that in several instances he
could have taken diamonds and other
jewels had he so chosen, and was sure
that he could have gone to any bank
in the city and obtained whatever he
demanded.
One of the crimes imputed to him,
that of entering the house of General
Anson G. McCook, when the general I*,1 *,
young son fired upon the burglar, he
declared he was innocent of. Smith de
nied absolutely that he had any con
federates and declares that he has been
working alone.

were most difficult to solve, and they
have occupied the attention of some

the application of electricity to the in

OBERLIN, 0., Feb. 6.â C. T. Beck
with, president of the defunct Citizens'
National Bank of this city, died at
10:45 o'clock to-night after two. days of
unconsciousness, during which death
was expected at any moment. Only the
family surrounded the deathbed of the
banker. Beckwith was about 65 years
of age.
On December 14 last the Federal
Grand Jury in Cleveland returned five
indictments against Beckwith upon the
charge, of violating. the national bank
ing laws in connection with loans made
to Mrs. Cassie L. Chadwick by the
Citizens' National Bank of Qberltn.
From the day of his arrest Beckwith's
health rapidly failed as a result of
worry over his troubles. He frequently
declared during his illness that he
wanted to die*. For several days prior
to his death he refused to take food in
any form. Death resulted directly from
heart trouble.
The death of President Beckwith may
materially weaken the charges of for
gery and conspiracy to misapply bank
funds against Mrs. Chadwick. Â»^

HERMOSILLO, Mexico, Feb. 5. â
General Luiz Torres, who has taken
hold against the Yaquis in the Mazat
ian Mountain County in an effort to
apprehend the murderers of the
Americans who were shot down near
Cobachi, has met with a new and
grave obstacle.
Torres has a force of more than 500
men. Recently several soldiers died
in a mysterious manner, their symp
toms suggesting poisoning. A number
of horses also died and whan the
deaths became more frequent among
the men an investigation was or-
dered
It was found that the Yaquis have
been poisoning the mountain springs
behind them, using for that purpose
poisonous herbs native to that section.
This new piece of strategy will greatly
retard the progress and work of ths
Torres expedition, which will in :he
future have to depend on pack trains
for their water supply, which must
be taken from wells at ranch**, a
great distance from the scene of their
operations.

CALX BUREAU. POST BUILDING.
WASHINGTON, Feb. s.â Senator Wil
liam B. Allison of lowa, one of the
leaders of the Senate, came out in un
mistakable terms in favor of railroaU
legislation in a statement to The Cail
correspondent to-day.
"I am strongly in favor," said he, ot
legislation giving the Government more
specific supervision over the rates â¢!
interstate carriers and the sooner such
legislation tan be passed the better. I
do not know what can be done in the
Senate at this session, but I should be
glad to see the House bill, or a mod
ification of it, passed before March 4.
If it could be done, an extra session
of Congress in the fall might be avert
ed."
"Do you favor the Eaeh-Townaend
bill as it stands?' was asked.
"So far as I have been able to study
it that seems to be a reasonable meas
ure, with all interests carefully safe
guarded. I cannot say that I would
be in favor of putting all of its fea
tures into law. There are somn
changes, perhaps, necessary. These
could be made in the Senate. There is
no difference of opinion on certain
phases of railroad traffic, as they re
late to the public. The question of
private cars, terminals and all other
discrimination of this character admits
of little or no discussion. It should
be done away with, and the sooner
the better.
REGULATION IS NEEDEIX
"Interstate transportation has grown
to such an extent in this country that
it needs some such regulation as the
President has proposed and as is con
tained in the Esch-Townsend bill.
r â  The question of time in the Sen
ate is, of course, very important. We
cannot tell how long the Swayne trial

afMvir oÂ» tit* sSkisHAi. â¢*â  Tttt.- C^xnml tfeÂ«'
on Interstate Commerce will, of. course,
call for time to consider the bill after
it conies from the House. . Should it be
reported to the Senate -there must be
considerable discussion." : .
"In case the committee shows no dis
position to report a bill, will any Re
publican move to bring it directly be
fore the Senate?"
â¢That is a pretty drastic method for
the Senate and an unusual proceeding.
So far as I can learn there is no dis
position in the Senate committee to
unnecessarily delay consideration. For
myself I would like to see the ques
tion settled as early as possible and an
agreement on the details of the bill.
The railroads themselves can help in
this matter if they will. I think they
appreciate the necessity of some leg
islation increasing the Government
power of regulation."
HILL, OX THE WARPATH.
James J. Hill, president of the Great
Northern Railroad Company, arrived
in Washington to-day as much op
posed to rate legislation as ever. lit
would not discuss the details of any
pending measure, but he did express
himself as unalterably opposed to Gov
ernment supervision of any kind.
"What do you think of the Esch-
Townsend bill now pending in the
House?" was asked.
"I don't think it will hurt any of the
railroad properties in which I am in
terested," said he. "and, believing this,
I have not studied it very carefully.
What I wish to particularly emphasise
in this matter is the danger to gen
eral business in attempting to force the
general principle of Government super
vision of rates and other railroad busi
ness. When the Federal Government
undertakes to spread its power over
private business for the purpose of
regulation or anything else it simply
means the destruction of individual
enterprise. This is a very critical time
to try experiments with the business
or the country. It means much not
only to the railroad investors them
selves, but to all branches of com
merce and Industry."
FIGHT TO A FINISH.
"Do you see any chance for the pass
age of a House rate bill by the Sen
ate?"
"1 am told that the friends of Â«uch
legislation are expressing the hope that
the Senate will do something after aIL
That may be â  possible. From personal
knowledge * I do not know, but let it
come. 3o much sooner will it be found
by thoÂ«e attempting ito force such a

not care to discuss the details of any

PAUL GILMORE
IS BEAUTIFUL
New Star at California Is
Ideal of the Chocolate
Eow, but Short on Acting
MAN TOO BUSY TO LOVE
Such Is the Theme Worked
Out in "The Mummy arid
the Humining Bird"
More beautiful than Herschel MsLyall
and cuter than anything is Mr. Paul
Gilmore, who cajne as a star to the
California last night in "The Mummy
and the Humming Bird." Mr. Gilmore
is new here. One would rather imag
ine him generally new if one had not
heard otherwise. But one has heard
frequent reports of Mr. Gilmore's fatal
beauty. They were not exaggerated.
It is all there. Moreover, as an ex
ponent of the art of playing the injured
husband without crinkling one's collar
the actor is unapproached. His sang
froid is entirely magnificent.
Mr. Gilmore had the happiness to be
preceded by John Drew as Lord Lum
ley in "The Mummy and the Humming
.Bird" during the play's run in New
' York. Sir Charles Wyndham began it
I in London. If I remember aright â and
j the latest evidence is to the effect â the
i piece met with a tempered approval
! in New York. Which shows what good
acting will do. As played last evening
at the California "The Mummy and the
Humming Bird " was engagingly un
convincing. The story is all about a
scientist who is too busy with his
chemicals to make love to his wife, and
as one of the characters says, objects
when one of his understudies does.
The particular understudy is m. sort of
j D'Annunzio, who wooes the lady with
i autographed novels and broken Eng
lish, and hag done it before. In fact.
D'Orelli, such is his name, has wooed
and won a young Italian peasant wo
man whose husband also objected. The
Italian girl dies and Giuseppe is on
D'Orelli's trail with a bread knife.
The first act shows Lord Lumley
mixing things in his study. His wjfe
I and cousin and her sweetheart are go
| ing out to dine and he is to go with
' them. But Lumley is just on the brink
of discovering argon or some such, and
goes on mixing. They plead with him
to come, but to no purpose, and you
are made to understand that the
i neglected wife is in danger from the at
tentions of D'Orelli. Th^y go then, and
shortly afterward the butler appears
with a satchel dropped by Lady Lum
ley. A poor Italian has picked it up.
Lumley then, in the fashion of scien
| lists when they happen to be Lords, in
vites the Italian, Giuseppe, to take put
luck with him, and discovers D'Orelli's
gu/lt. It is all very naive, very trust
fui, very unconvincing. What of illu
; sion Mr. Henderson â who made the
j play â has not contrived to lose, Mr.
i Gilmore does his most to get rid of.
1 And so throughout the play.
Mr. Gilmore is not a success as a
scientist. Nor does he rabidly suggest
an English nobleman. As he mixes his
drugs at his study table one is in fact
irresistibly if impertinently reminded
of a smart young drug clerk. Nor is
his attitude as the injured husband
more plausible. Mr. Henderson makes
Lumley own that he "supposes that he
is different from other men." He is
indeed. The lady has just flung off
after declaring she has a right to hap
piness, etc., and Mr. Gilmore's Lum
ley takes the matter about as pas
sionately as he â might the untying of
his shoe lace. It is not wholly Mr.
I Gilmore's fault. The playwright makes
'< the absorbed, scientific dreamer of the
i first act in the third a shrewd, re
) sourceful, practical man of the world,
i and the like, and as I have said, it
has taken good acting to make the part
oonvlncing. Mr. Gilmore may be a
very good man, but he is short on act
ing.
The rest fill in as pleases them. John
Martin is really clever as Giuseppe, and
Signor D'Orelli is done quite effectively
I by Theodore Terry. Bessie Brown
Howard would not matter only for v her
wonderful Western burr, and the rest
do not matter. Still Mr. Gilmore is as
lovely a thing as ever chocolate row
set eyes on.
BLANCHE PARTINGTON.
â¦ * â¢
The Quigley brothers had the blase
first-nighters at the Orpheum laughing
till the seams strained last night. One
of them had some brogue gags that
would make even King Monologlst Kel
ly's best seem like a funeral march
with the soft pedal on. "But politicians
do something," insists one Quigley.
"Yes," replies the other, "but it is hard
to catch them at it." "Did you do any
thing to help the country when you
were in Congress?" "Oh, yes; I moved
] to adjourn once."
Some of the gags would lose their
snap in black and white, but in the
Quigley brogue "they are to laugh."
Happy Jack Gardner, roonologist and
singing comedian, proved his right to
the sobriquet from the start. Robert H.
Hodge and a good company started a
gigglefest with the troubles of Bill
Blithers, bachelor. Newell and Nlblo
made saxophones and xylophones talk.
Cole, and Johnson, colored musicians,
gave a varied programme that had in
it numbers to please any sort of audi
ence. Cole's rendering of Tolstoi's
"Good-by" was remarkably effective.
The holdovers received generous ap
plause. /
At the Alcazar last night, in the
midst of the gallant adventures of
"The Gay Lord Que^t," the lights on
the north side of O'Farrell street, in
cluding the theater circuit, went out
and the play was finished by candle
light.
At the first intimation of darkness
the audience showed ati inclination to
go out also, but a few becalming
words from Stage Director Butler
ceused them to stay. In the meantime
the entire company, headed by Her
ber Farjeon and Calvin Dlx, was
scouring for candles arid lanterns.
Each of the actors was supplied with
a box of matches and the play pro
ceeded without interruption..
When the change of act was reached
the stagehands went ahead shifting
the scenes by the light of candles and
lanterns and the audience sat through
out the intermission, enjoying the
novel spectacle. The rest of the play
JAPAN LOSES A HERO
OF PORT ARTHUR SIEGE
GENERAL MATSUMARA DIES AT FRONT
Oyama Will Attack as Soon as Weather
Conditions Permit an Advance.
LONDON, Feb. 6. â General Mat
sumara, according to the Tokio cor
respondent of the Daily Telegraph,
has died at the front of congestion of
the brain. He commanded the opera
tions at 203 Meter Hill and was dec
orated and promoted for heroism.
According to the Daily Mail's, Tokio
correspondent. Lieutenant General
Tachimi. in command of the Eighth

ST. PETERSBURG. Feb. .6. â Ac
cording to General Kuropatkin's last
reports, which indicate the wounding
of a third Russian general, Demobow
ski, the operations at Sandiapu and
the fighting at Shakhe have been mo
mentarily suspended. The Russia na
successfully repulsed the latest attack
of the Japanese eastward with he:>.vy
loss.
The cold is still intense, then- being
24 degrees of frost.
There are indications that ths Jap
anese are preparing to break th ? â  lac
tivity on their account as soon as the
weather moderates.
The War Office is dosed, and no
further facts regarding the pports.
that General Kuropntkin is about to
give up his command can be obt*rned.
General Koiropatkin, in a report, to
Emperor Nicholas, says;
"No fighting was reported on FÂ°b
iuary 4. At present activity \s co.i
fined to operations by our voluntv>rs,
who harass the enemy. There is ar
tillery firing on both_ sides, and a
hasty strengthening of positions by
both the Russians and Japanese. '
General Kuropatkln on Friday re
ported the repulse of the Japanese ad
vance guard on the left flank toward
Sanosyr and Chansan with slight
losses, the Japanese leaving fifty dead
on the field.

DURAND VISITS PRESIDENT.
Kmbassador's Sunday (all Gives Rise
to Peace Rumor.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 5. â Sir Morti
mer Durand, the British Embassador,
was at the White House to
night and was in conference
with President Roosevelt for
almost an hour. With him also w;is
Spring-Rice, formerly attached to the
British Embassy at Washington, but
r.ow First Secretary of the British
Embassy at St. Petersburg. Spring-
Rice is a personal friend of the
President, whom he has known for
some time.
The presence of Embassador Dur
;md at the White House on a Sunday
night â quite an unusual thing tor
hi m â in company with Spring-Rice,
who is in ?he United States on a va
cation and'froph from St. Petersburg,
gave rise to the surmise that the ces
sation of the war between Russia and
Japan might be under consideration.

WILLOWS WILL
HAVE A PARK
Southern Pacific Agrees "to
. Expenii Large Sum Beauti

Special Dispatch to The Call.
WILLOWS, Feb. s.â The Southern
Pacific is to lay out a spacious railroad
park at Willows on the land owned by
the company r rth of its depot. Last
spring the building of a town park was
agitated by the citizens and a commit
tee from the Board of Trade waited on
the Southern Pacific officials asking for
a long lease on the above mentioned
tract, assuring the corporation that
more than $2500 would be expended in
a model park. The railroad informed
this committee that in view of the tide
of Immigration now flowing toward the
Sacramento Valley they were desirous
of doing everything possible to improve
the appearance of the town property
through which the line runs and that
they would bear the entire expense of
building a park at Willows.
Several days ago the construction de
partment sent a surveying party to lay
out the pleasure grounds. The land
mapped out was so much smaller than
what was expected that the Board of
Trade called a meeting and sent at once
a committee to wait on the Southern
Pacific, with the view of having the
company enlaVge its plans. Superinten
dent McÃride visited Willows and v~a
so much impressed with the great in
terest manifested by the citizens that
he assured the people that the railroad
would reconsider its plans and would
lay out a park that wouW be an adorn
ment to the town and a source of pride
to the railroad.

SPEECH STIRS
GERMAN WRATH
Words Credited to British
Official Cause a Storm in
the Empire of the kaiser
LONDON, Feb. s.â The speech of
Arthur Hamilton Lee. Civil Lord of
the Admiralty, on February 3 has
created such a storm in Germany that
the Government organs here this
morning are busiiy endeavoring by
means of editorials to alter its effect.
Lee himself, in a communication to the
Standard, makes a similar effort by de
claring that he was incorrectly re
ported and giving what he calls a cor
rect version, which in its essentials
differs from the original report." Ac
cording to the Standards Berlin dis
patches, unjess Foreign Minister Lans
dowiie promptly repudiates responsi
bility for Lee's utterances, the Gov- j
eminent will make a formal complaint. ,
Lee is quoted as having said in a |
speech on February 2 that in the dis
tribution of Great Britain's naval
forces. Englapd has had not so much
to keep her eye on France and the
Mediterranean, but to look with
anxiety toward the North Sea; that the
fleets had been so distributed as to
enable them to deal with any danger
In that direction, should it occur.
Under existing conditions, he said, the
British Navy would get its blow in |
first, and he maintained that "by the
recent naval reforms Great Britain's
Strength as a naval fighting power has ;
been practically doubled during the j
last few weeks."

COAL MINERS 60 OUT
Employers Order the Men
to Eeturn to Work To-
Day or Accept Discharge
LODZ, Russia, Feb. s.â The situation
here has reached a critical stage and
it will be decided to-morrow whether
the conflict shall end or the strike be
continued. The employers met on Sat
urday and decided to reopen all their
factories on Monday, when men report
ing for work will be re-engaged and
the remainder discharged. A large
number of workmen are disposed to
resume, but fear that the malcontents
will employ coercion.
The newly appointed Governor Gen
eral, Archimovitch, is giving the closest
attention to the situation. In the
course of an interview this afternoon
the Governor General said that to-mor
row would bring the critical test. If
the strikers, once resumed, he said, the
strike would be broken. Being asked
whether he considered the strike a po
litical movement, the Governor General
said:
â¢'Yes and no. It is a labor move
ment, but the strikers' specific de
mands are suggested by politlcaJ agi
tators, many of whom are foreigners."
ST. PETERSBURG, Feb. 6.â The
strike movement in Poland has spread
to the Governments of Warsaw, Kallsz,
Lublin and Suvalki. Martial law ha.3
heen declared In Kalisz, Radom and
Seidlec.
The workmen to the number of 4000
in the car shops here have drawn up
a manifesto repudiating the delegates
who wore put forward as representing
them in the deputation which visited
Emperor Nicholas at Tsaxskoe Selo on
Wednesday. They assert that these
men were selected by the employers
and were riot representatives of the
workmen. The employes of one or two
other factories may follow suit, but
the workmen in general are inclined to
stand by the deputation.
There were a few slight collisions be
tween Lessner's workmen and the po
lice guarding the factory yesterday.
Poland, however, continues to be the
storm center of the disturbances.
Though the strike has ceased in some
establishments, it has assumed a more
important phase by its extension to
the great coal mines and sugar fac
tories, and three more Governments
have been placed "under martial law.
Police and Cossacks have had to break
up x number of demonstrations and
quell disorders, but as yet there has
been no repetition of fighting on the
scale of the first collisions.
An imperial ukase has been issued
appointing M. Saburoff a member of
the Council of the Empire, president of
the special conference to debate the
committee of Ministers' proposals for
reform of the Senate and for the fram
ing of laws, for the local administrative
courts. The Emperor expressed a de
sire for the speedy conclusion of the
labor conference.
Foreign Minister LamsdoriT in an of
ficial note to the British Embassador
has formally disavowed the action of
Deputy Chief, of Police Roudneff of
Moscow in exhibiting a placard show

money from Japan and other sources
for the purpose of crippling the Gov
ernment works.

COMMITTEE IS IN SESSION
Subpenas Will Be Issued If Alleged Bribers
Decline to Appear and Give Testimony.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. s.â lf Senators
French, Emmons, Bunkers and Wright
fail to volunteer as witnesses Â«on their
own behalf they will be subpenaed by
the committee before which they are
now on trial. The committee met to
day to discuss this feature of the case,
and though no announcement was
made that it had been definitely decid
ed to eubpena the accused Senators the
following facts were pointed to:
When William Corbin made his
charge before the Senate that Emmons,
Bunkers, French and Wright were
guilty of bribery each of the accused
pot up in turn and, after Indignantly
denying the charge, demanded that a
committee be forthwith appointed to
investigate the affair and examine
every person directly or indirectly in
volved in the scandal. These state
ments in themselves were a confession
of willingness an the part of the ac
cused to appear and testify and it is
presumed that after making them they
will not want to be subpenaed, but will
appear and, of course, deny they are
guilty.
The committee announced last Thurs
day that it was its desire to hear every
person having any connection whatever
with the alleged offense. There is only
one 'way the committee can accomplish
its desire, and that is if any one refuses
to testify to compel him to do so or
send him to Jail for the term of the
legislature for contempt.
The news that Detective Tichenor
had thrashed Senator French in San
Francisco wÂ«a widely discussed here
to-day. All, even the friends of French,
admit that he has greatly injured his
ase by his belligerent actions, and the
opinion is equally general that French
will now abandon his expressed inten
tion to slap Tlchenor's face every time
he meets him.
The avowed willingness of Joseph S.
Jordan, the man accused of passing
money to the four State Senators, to go
before the committee of investigation
tow night has led to considera
ble speculation as to the attitude he
"ill assume upon his appearance in the
Senate. However, one thing positively
asserted by Jordan is that he will not
State's evidence.
It is expected that evidence will be
ntroduced before the case is concluded
the effect that several of the marked
:ave been recovered by the prose
cution. It is claimed that this will have
to be done if the case against the Sen
ators is to be clinched.
siderable of the time to-morrow,
night will be taken up by the defense
in putting witnesses on the stand for
â¢he purpose of attempting to discredit
the witnesses who have already ap
peared for the prosecution.
MAY LOSE SALARIES.
W- emblrmen Absent Without Excuse
Are likely to Be Docked.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 6.â The As
*cmbly was called to order this morn
ng by Speaker Prescott under the rule
Uiat provides when there are not
eh present on one legislative day
10 constitute a quorum, the Legislature
shall meet daily thereafter at 9:30 un
til a quorum is in attendance. There
were ten members present. The House
will convene again to-morrow at 9:30
under the rule.
If the avowed intention of several
members of the Assembly is carried
out. some of the Assemblymen who
absented themselves Friday and Satur
day without permission will lose their
salaries for the time they were absent.
Those of the lower house who live at
a distance and cannot go home when
ac adjournment is taken are wroth at
the absentee*, because they are com
pelled to remain in Sacramento and
are anxious that the work go on while
they are here. Under the rules a for
feiture of salary may be had.
There is a strong possibility that
there will not be a quorum at the hour
of convening Monday morning and the
manbers present will have to "dally
along" until enough Assemblymen
come In to make up a sufficient number
to do business.
Houser of Los Angeles is leading thÂ«
movement to make those who absent
themselves without excuse suffer loss
of pay for the days they are away.
CEREAL COMMISSION.
Bright Prospects of Measure of Inter
est to Agriculturists.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 5. â AH of the
talk ahout the lack of gluten in Cali
lornia wheat has had its effect and
Senator Diggs' bill providing for the
establishment of the California Cereal
Improvement Commission is going
: iy on toward final passage. The
bill has been favorably reported back
<- committee to which it was as
| and re-referred to the Finance
I ommittee, which now has it under
f-onsideration.
The bill provides that It shall be the
duty of the Governor within thirty
days after the passage of the act to
nt three Commissioners who
c hall constitute the California Cereal
Improvement Commission. It shall be
th<- duty of the commission to make
investigations under the super
vision of the Agricultural Experiment
M of the University of California
as it may deem best in an effort to dis
c-over improved methods of cereal cul
ture that will not only increase the
yield, but that will increase the per

The bill also provides that the com
mission shall receive no compensation
for its services other than traveling
expenses actually incurred.
NEW KATIONAH PARK.
Purchase of the "Pinnacles" Is Ap
proved by Both Houses.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 5. â Assembly
man Slaven's resolution providing for
the establishment of a National* Park
at '^The Pinnacles," San Benito Coun
tr. â 'â¢-Â»Â» passed both houses and is now
ready for enrollment which gives
those that favor many places of public
recreation an opportunity to turn
their attention to the purchase of i
Fort Humboldt, Humboldt County. A I
bill providing for the acquirement of
Fort Humboldt was introduced early
in the session by Senator Selvage, but
was subsequently withdrawn, amend
ed in minor particulars and reintro
duced.
The object of Senator Selvage in
asking for the purchase of Fort Hum
boldt Js to preserve the same for its
historic interest. Fort Humboldt was
occupied by U. S. Grant in ISSI and
played an important part in the set
tlement of the great wilderness that
is no.w a center of civilization, the old
fort being included within the cor
porate limits of the city of Eureka.
It is not believed the bill will meet
with any serious opposition.
FAVOR NATURE STUDIES.
Additions to School Courses Provided
in Two Measures.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. B. â Nature
study, agriculture and kindred sub
jects are being advocated by legisla
tors here as desirable additions to the
regular courses of the public schools
of the State. Senator Muenter has
introduced two bills relating to this
subject, one of which has been fa
vorably reported upon by the Com
mittee on County Government, the
other being under consideration by
the Comm'ttee on Education.
The one favorably reported pro
vides that County Superintendents of
Schools, whenever petitioned by a ma
jority of the trustees of each district
of at least 26 per cent of all the pri
mary and grammar school districts of
any county to make the appointment,
shall immediately appoint a super
visor of nature study, agriculture and
related subjects for the primary and
grammar schools of such counties.
The supervisors of this work, it is fur
ther provided, shall be persons who
had been duly accredited by the State
Board of Education.
The agricultural sections of the
State are strongly in favor of the
passage of the bill, and in all prob
ability it will go through without op
position.
DEATH BLOW TO RACES.
Measure Prohibiting Pool-Selling Be
fore Public Morals Committee.
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 6. â Members
of the Assembly who are laying for
the chance to vent their eloquence on
Espy's anti-pool selling bill are going
to demand, probably to-morrow, that
the Committee en Public Morals,
which has had it under consideration
since January 11. report it in. Just
what complications have been holding
the bill In committee for almost a
month a majority of the lower house
is unable to understand, and an ex
planation is in order.
The bill is Intended to stop all pool
selling upon the result of any horse
race within or without the confines of
any racetrack, and if it passes it will
mean a death blow to the racing
game on the coast. It is apparent
that powerful influences will be di
rected against the bill, but the Assem
bly as a whole wants to hear it dis
cussed from every standpoint, and
hence a demand will be made that It
be reported out, either favorably or
unfavorably.

SAN RAFAEL, Feb. s.â The Assem
bly Committee on State Prisons an 1
Reformatories, headed by Chairman

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1803.
BARELY ESCAPE
DEATH IN ICE
Thirty Men on Wrecked Boat
Rescued and Forced to
W T alk on Floes to Shore
WERE MAKING PASSAGE
Vessel Meets Disaster tn
the Jam Off Delaware by
Striking a Sunken Barge
LEWES, Del., Feb. s.â Thirty men ;
narrowly escaped drowning to-day in
the icy waters of the Harbor of Ref- I
uge at the Delaware breakwater and,
after being rescued with the greatest
difficulty by the crews of two tugs,
they were forced to make their way
to shore on foot over the heavy ice
iioes with which the Delaware River
and bay is blocked.
The men whose lives were imperiled
were Camain Jacobs and his crew of
twenty-nine men of the Philadelphia
City ice boat No. 3, which made its
way down from Philadelphia in an ef
fort to make a channel for vessels ice- *
bound at the breakwater. The ice j
boat collided with the sunken barge
Santiago, the masts and buoys of
which had been carried away "by the
ice jam and a large hole was stove in
her hull. ;
Captain Jacobs' signals of distress
were answered by the tugs Teaser and
Boxer. The tugs experienced much dif
ficulty in reaching the rapidly sinking
ice boat. The ice Jam prevented the
tugs from docking and the crew of the
ice boat, after being taken off, stiff
from exposure and nearly exhausted,
managed to complete a perilous jour
ney afoot across the ice fields to shore.
Navigation is almost at a standstill
on the Delaware because of the ice
which is Jamming the stream from
Trenton, N. J., to the breakwater and
extends nearly ten miles out to sea.
There is a large fleet of vessels of all
kmds at the breakwater unable to
make any headway against the Jam.
Several ships are fast in the ice at
the Horseshoe, a bend in the river at
Gloucester, N. J., and it will probably
be several days before the city ice
boats can clear a passage for them.
STORM CUTS OFF SOUTH.
Wire Service Paralyzed and the Rail-
roads Crippled.
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Feb. s.âTele
phone and telegraph service over a
wide range of the South was almost
completely crippled by heavy sleet to
day. Railroad service also suffered and
in some towns the lighting and street
car Sftcilities were suspended. The tie
up was the most complete in many
years, and although the telegraph com
panies and railroads have large forces
of men at work, it may be two or three
days before normal conditions are re- >
stored.
The storm, which covered with a
thick icy coat Kentucky, Tennessee,
Arkansas, Oklahoma, Indian Territory,
Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana and
Georgia prevailed intermittently for
three days and the wires broke under
the accumulated ice. Service from
Louisville to Memphis, Nashville,
Chattanooga and Birmingham was but
little interrupted. South of these cit
ies to the gulf only two or three wires
were working to-night. The fall of
snow and sleet varies from one to three
Inches.
For several hours Atlanta and New
Orleans were cut off from the rest of
the country. All wires were down
from Memphis to Natchez and New
Orleans and the telegraph companies
sent messages for those points to New
York and down the coast, but even
then the service was interrupted for a
time. Two hundred poles went down
in Mississippi.
In Chattanooga the streets were filled
with broken wires. The lighting and
streetcar currents were turned off to
avoid danger to pedestrians and line
men.
ICE JAM OFF NEW YORK.
Floes Carry Off Buoys, Making Navi-
gation Dangerous.
NEW YORK, Feb. 5. â Ice floes
completely filled New York harbor to
day, rendering the passage of vessels
into and out of the port slow and dif
ficult. In the Narrows the ice pack
was so dense that even the powerful
transatlantic liners had trouble In
forcing a passage.
One of the serious results of the
presence of vast floes in the lower bay
during the past four days has been
the breaking and carrying away of
great numbers of buoys in the various
ship channels. Captains of coastwise
steamers and Sandy Hook pilots have
reported a number of narrow escapes
from grounding, caused by the dis
placement of buova. Captain Shepard
of the lighthouse board said that the
displacement of buoys by ice during
the week was unprecedented in the
history of the department and that
the conditions of navigation Into and
out of the port are the most danger
ous that have ever existed.
All the steamships of the Sound
fleet arrived safely to-day, although
several hours late. Their captains re
ported that heavy Ice was encountered
throughout the Sound and that navi
gation was barely possible. On sev
eral occasions the fleet of New York
bound steamships was compelled to
unite and attack the ice In the wedge
formation. Owing to a change In the
wind the North and East rivers were
comparatively clear of ice during the
day and the ferries were operated
with little Interruption.
FREEZE TIES UP TRAFFIC.
Vessels Held Fast in the Ice Off
Philadelphia.
PHILADELPHIA, Feb. 6.â An al
most complete suspension of the coast
wise trade out of thjs port has fol
lowed the general freeze-up of the
harbor. There are a number of vessels
here, but none will take charters un
til there is some probability of being
able to get out of the Delaware River,
which is impossible at this time. Very
little coal is being received at this port
in consequence of the extreme cold in
the mining regions and great delay is
being experienced by steamships under
charter for the West Indies in getting
their cargoes.
More than fifty vessels were held in
COMEDY WILL PORTRAY
OLD GERMAN LIFE.
Trau Koengin" Wiff Be Pfayed here
ACCOMPLJSHED YOUNG WOMAN WHO WILL. TAKE THE NAME PART IN
"FRAU KOENIGIN." A BRILiJANT GERMAN PLAT. WHICH WILL. BE GIV
EN AT THE ALHAMBRA THEATER, SATURDAY EVENING, FEBRUART 23.
As the date approaches for the pro
duction of the German comedy "Frau
Koenigln," which Is to be given for the
benefit of the library fund of the Ger
man department of the State Univer
sity, local German and society circles
are manifesting unusual and active in
terest in the undertaking. The play is
set for Saturday evening, February 26,
at the Alhambra. The performance is
under the direction of Herr Arthur
Becker.
BY GRACE LLEWELLYN JONES.
Franz Koppel-Elfeldt, to whose
poetic genius the charming verses of
this comedy owe their form, has been
so well known for years at the Royal
Theater of Dresden that he needs no
introduction. His play of "The Renais
sance" brought him renown not only in
Germany, but among playwrights the
world over. Schoenthau, too, the col
laborator, is known in America through
a translation of "Die Beruehmte Frau,"
brought out by Daly in New York, un
der the title "The Great Unknown." It
was Baron yon Berger, the noted direc
tor of the Deutsche Schauspielhaus, the
close friend of the Emperor and his
honored adviser on all dramatic affairs,
who first brought out this comedy of
"Frau Koenigin" in Hamburg. In the
title role Frau yon Hotenthal, once a
celebrated member of the Imperial
Theater of Vienna, made a notable suc
cess.
Almost simultaneous with this pro
duction was the one In Berlin at the
Lessing Theater, under the able direc
tion of Oscar Blumenthal. The very
argument of the play, being the taming
of a capricious and perfectly charming
girl wiferstarted much literary discus
sion, and parallels were immediately
drawn with the treatmentof the sub
ject in "The Taming of the Shrew" and
in the Spanish comedy of Moreto's "El
Deaden con el Desden." The Spaniard
portrays an exquisitely refined woman,
whose nature responds to poetry and
music, but, like an oversensitive in
strument, yields only discord at the ap
proach of any ruder touch. He brings
to the caging of this wild bird as re
fined and elegant a tamer as alone
could accomplish so delicate a play of
opposing wills. The manners of the
Â«.amer are far removed from the sturdy
Elizabethan methods of Petruchio, and
the ice at the lower bay to-day, and
a number of ocean steamships, which
attempted to force their way through
the obstruction at the Delaware Capes,
were compelled to return to sea and
anchor for the night.
Off BillingÃport, N. J., fifteen coal
barges are held fast in the ice. They
belong to the Reading Railway* Com
pany, and are inwardbound from Bos
ton. v
BRIDGE WASHED AWAY.
Traffic in Arizona Is Delayed by
Storm.
PHOENIX, A. T., Feb. Â§, â All wires
are down at the Gila River bridge
.on the Maricopa and Phoenix Rail
road and though no definite reports
have been received, it is rumored that
a hundred feet of the cribbing put in
to repair a former break at the bridge,
has been washed away. The com
pany hopes to transfer passengers to
morrow. Phoenix and Eastern train
service extends as far as Florence
only.
The Santa Fe train due here early
l
the lady is from the land of more illu
sive charm.
Around the theme the two German
dramatists have thrown the pleasant
disguise of ar distant epoch and a ro
mantic setting. The time is that be
loved of German love poets, the days
of the "Minnesaenger," when those
splendid legends of Parsifal, Lohen
grin and Tannhauser were still fresh
in the hearts of their poet-knights;
when the love lyrics of Walther yon
der Vogelweide and Heinrlch yon
Veldeke were as near to the people as
Burns and Byron to our day and gen
eration.
Through a series of scenes of comic
affectation and the worship of a sym
bolic and disembodied love, which has
turned the head of the little wife,
there rung the song of the nightin
gale and the lyric note of the true
Minnesaenger â when in the old days
Minne meant both memory and love.
If she had to be shamed like a child
into the final shattering of her false
gods, still there tB no ungentle touch
in the steady hand of her tamer, who
returns fresh from battle to find her
in the glamour of a court of love,
under the new and dangerous charm
of flattery.
With only two acts at their disposal
the authors have succeeded in pre
senting to us not only a romantic
setting from the old days of the trou
badours, but a truly universal comedy
of the human heart; the entangle
ment of the most candid of natures in
a web of pretense and affectation, and
the final disentangling by its own in
nate strength and purity. With no in
volved psychology of analysis or sit
uation, in the greatest simplicity, we
understand simultaneously the mo
tive and the action that translates it.
There is no problem and no mystery
of symbols. We have no need of a
commentator to explain the exegesis.
I believe we shall really welcome the
chance to enjoy a true bit of German
drama, wherein walk knights and
ladies, peasants and retainers, of real
flesh and blood, who can move us to
natural laughter and perhaps to some
very gentle and refreshing tears. And
all honor to the tireless energy and
really ambitious effort of the well
known stage director who is to bring
out "Frau Koenigin" on a San Fran
cisco stage.
Saturday morning will arrive some
time this evening, but no train will
depart until Monday morning. The
Cave Creek flood has subsided and the
Capitol building is surrounded by a
sea of mud.
NORTHERN PORTS BLOCKED.
New England Coast Suffers From the
Ice Puck.
BOSTON, Feb. 5. â The New Eng
land Coast, south of Cape Cod, is to
night the victim of one of the most
extensive ice embargoes of recent win
ters. Whfl^ In Boston harbor the
only inconvenience is caused by float
ing ice, south of the Cape conditions
are far different, Nantucket Sound
being almost completely closed, while
Vineyard Sound is filled with ice. Nar
ragansett Bay is full of ice, and ship
ping there is practically at a stand
still.
) Throughout the day the weather
was cold, but the temperature rose
gradually toward night, though it re
mained too low to warrant predictions
of an Immediate thaw.
WOMAN DRINKS
CARBOLIC ACID
Mrs. Rebecca Eklund Puts an
End to Her Troubles With
Draught ot Deadly Poison
DISAPPOINTED IN LOVE
Squanders a Large Sum of
Money on a Man With
Whom She Was Infatuated
Mrs. Rebecca Eklund, a divorced
woman, of Fremont and Harrison
streets, committed suicide last night
about 7:30 o'clock in front of Thomas
J. Morton's livery stable at the corner
of Geary and Leavenworth streets. A
few moments bsfore, the unfortunate
woman had been ejected from the
stable by Fred Jackson, a carriage
washer, with whom she had been asso
ciating.
Half intoxicated, Mrs. Eklund brood
ed over her treatment. She went to
P. Flatow's drug store at Geary and
Jones streets, purchased 10 cents" worth
of carbolic acid, went back in front of
the stable and drank the poison. By
standers heard her exclaim in a loud
voice as she poised the bottle of dead
ly liquid, "You shall pay for this, Fred
Jackson." Before she could be de
terred, the woman swallowed the acid
and sank on the sidewalk.
George Kreplin, a grocer across the
street, poured a bottle of oil down the
dying woman's throat and called for
the ambulance. Before she could be
taken to the Central Emergency Hospi
tal s"he was dead.
She had been drinking for some days.
Her mother, Mrs. George W. Edwards,
says she gave her daughter some
money to .pay a doctor for an opera
tion which she had to have performed,
and that Rebecca spent the money.
All day yesterday the mother searched
for'the girl without finding her.
Mrs. Eklund was seen to enter Mor
ton's stables and a moment later come
out crying. Jackson, the man with
whom she was keeping company, said
she came in to him drunk and he threw
her out. He denied that he had been
going with her or had any relations
with her. People in the neighborhood
say that the woman was always
around the stable with Jackson or
some of the other men employed there.
Mrs. Eklund was left considerable
money by an old man, a roomer in her
mother's house, who died recently.
This her mother says she squandered
on the man with whom she was in
fatuated.
The dead woman was about 28 years
of age. The body was taken to the
Morgue.
RAILROAD FIREMAN

EMPORIA, Kans.. Feb. s.â At mid
night last night freight train No. 34
and an Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
switch engine collided in the west end
of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe
yards. Daniel O. Holman, 28 years
old, was burned to death. He was
shoveling coal into the firebox when
the collision occurred and was thrown
into the furnace and incinerated. The

STEAMSHIP FAST IX ICE.
Passengers Marooned on the lowa Off
Chicago Harbor.
CHICAGO, Feb. s.â The Goodrich line
passenger steamship lowa, which left
Milwaukee early to-day, is fast in the
ice two miles outside the Chicago har
bor. Twenty or thirty passengers are
supposed to be on the vessel, but the
officials of the company said to-night
that they were in no danger. The lowa
is surrounded by an immense field of
ice, and so far a tug has been unable
to reach her. The lowa has been mak
ing daily trips between Milwaukee and

Crooks Break Into Home of
Henry Meyers on Lombard
Street and Take Coin
Henry Meyers of 2531 Lombard street
reported a daring burglary to the police
at the Central Police Station Saturday
night. It wm committed early Saturday
evening and without the knowledge
of Mrs. Meyers, who was in th* house
at the time. Bureau drawers, trunks
and closets in two rooms were ran
sacked, but the thieves got only 122 in
cash for their work.
According to the story Meyers told
at the Central Police Station, he left
his home about 5 o'clock in the even
ing on "some business and promised to
return about 7. His wife was alone at
the time. After keeping his appoint
ment Meyers came back at the ap
pointed time. Soon after his return
hr had occasion to go into one of tho
bedrooms, where a condition of dis
order met his view. Bureau drawers
had been pulled out and their contents
scattered over the floor. Trunks had
been broken open and searched. The
thorough work of the thieves was
everywhere In evidence. Meyers found
the same state of affairs in an adjoin
ing room and discovered that from a
drawer in one of the tables $22 in coin
bad been stolen.
Mrs. Meyers said she heard no
sound, though she was within a few
feet of where the burglars were at
work. She knew nothfng of the rob
bery until the discovery was made by
her husband. How the thieves entered
the house is a mystery, but it is be
lieved that they used a skeleton key
on one of the side doors. The windows
were all tightly fastened and there
was no indication that anything had
been disturbed. Had Mrs. Meyers
come upon the crooks while they wera
at work she would probably have been
killed. As soon as the house was
placed in order, Meyers went to the
Central Station and made a report of
the matter. Detectives are at work on
the case and are said to have a claw.

READY TO TRY
SERGEANT ELLIS
Grand Jury Report Said to
Be Prepared in the China
town Gambling Cases
This evening the Police Commission
ers will meet to try Police Sergeant
Thomas Ellis for alleged complicity in
the plot to blackmail gambling games
ia Chinatown and furnish funds for the
1 'sack" that is supposed to be hanging,
at certain periods of the week, within
reach of the hand that rocks the
Chinatown cradle and tries to rule the
little political world at San Francisco.
A summary of the situation is not
necessary, but the aftermath promises
to be interesting and may be presented
in concrete form in the following fore-
Strpeant Ellis will be tried by the Po
lice Commissioners, and the report of
the police committee of the Grand
Jury will be taken under consideration
L> the board. But tht Police Board
will bt the judges of Ellis' fate.
The jury report, however, is not in a
very satisfactory condition and has lost
much of its force. At least, this is the
belief of many, because of the devia
tion of the grand jurors from the orig
litti path of investigation. The first
plan would have included an effort to
show that Chjff of Police Wittman
was equally responsible with members
of the Chinatown squad in "giving in
formation" that insured the Chinese
gamblers of immunity from raids of
those who might undertake a reform
movement on their own account.
Ellis will, of course, make the defense
that he Is not guilty. The rank and
nic of the Police Department are with
hjm. . So m,any patrolmen and sergeants
have been accused from time to time of
knowledge of the mysterious "sack"
that repetition of the tales have made
them callous, and they refuse to listen
to the old-time cry of "wolf." Ellis
made no confessions that implicate the
Chief, but he is said to have told the
Grand Jury that he always stood in
a position to obey orders and supposed
that these orders were given with hon
est purpose. The sergeant and Police
men Heinz and O'Brien have been
singled out ac the scapegoats, and as
it is expected that the police commit
tee of the Grand Jury will make some
â¢ort of a report this afternoon to al
low the commission to go ahead with
Its work of Investigation, the supposi
tion is that the trial will proceed with
out interruption.
Heinz was used by ex-Police Com
missioner Hutton to get evidence that
money has been passed to members of
the Police Department by denizens of
Hinckley ; alley and other notorious
places on the tenderloin. Hutton has
prepared evidence to show that Ellis
notified the Chinese gamblers of a pro
posed raid, but there is doubt as to
whether certain other members of the
Police Department were not the go
betweens, and the evidence is believed
to be incomplete. Ellis has been noti
fied to be ready to make defense to
night and has engaged an attorney.
There is much speculation as to
â whether the administration will take
any hand in the fight, but it is reported
that powerful influence has been brought
to bear to chow that Ellis is one of
the most reliable men in , the service.
In this the friends of ex-Chief of Po
lice Lees are said to figure.
Captain John Seymour, ex-chief of
city detectives, has been trying to rib
Ellis up to standing by the Grand Jury,
which seems to have in view the un
doing of the SchroiU administration.
Captain Seymour has no particular love
for Chief Wittman, so the gossips say,
and has not overlooked a little counter
investigation that may crop up at the
last moment and upset a deal of pres
ent-day speculation.
Ellis' report to the Grand Jury to a
certain extent bears out the charge of
corruption, but gives no possible clew
to the men who have profitedâ if ever
any haveâ by the bribes of the Chinese
gamblers.

CARDOZA MUST
FACE CHARGES
Former Purser of the City
of California Is Eun to
Earth After Long Chase
After evading the minions of the law
and the Pinkertons for nearly a year,
Joseph T. Cardoza, wanted here for
embezzlement, was run to earth yester
day and brought back to this city to
Btand trial. Cardoza is accused by J.
D. Amos of embezzling $128 90 from
the Pacific Coast Steamship Company
while he was purser of the City of Cali
fornia.
The Pinkertons and the local police
have been on the lookout for Cardoza
ever since he disappeared from this
city last April. A few days ago the
Pinkerton agency got word that Car
doza was in hiding at Clement, a small
station near Lodi. Detectives Kimball
and Loomis yesterday went there ahd
brought Cardoza back. He is locked
up in a cell at the City Prison-
On March 31 of last year J. D. Amos,
auditor of the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company, swore to a warrant charging
Cardoza with embezzling $128 90. At
that time Amos said he believed the
purser's shortage would probably
reach $5000, as his alleged thefts were
supposed to have been going on for
a long time.
Cardoza is said to have collected
money from passengers while he was
the purser of the City of California
and never rendered an accounting to
the officials. He is supposed to have
given the passengers old tickets, and
in this way he managed to cover up
his defalcations for a long time.
The officials finally discovered that
something was wrong and Amos swore
out a warrant for Cardoza's arrest
In the meantime the purser fled and
managed to keep his whereabouts a
secret till a few days ago, when the
Pinkerton men unearthed him, He is
believed to have been hiding at
Clement ever since the warrant for his
arrest was sworn out.
Cardoza refused to volunteer any in
formation either to the Pinkerton men
or to the police. He takes his arrest
calmly. It is understood that the of
ficers of the Pacific Coast Steamship
Company will prosecute the former
purser to the full extent of the law, as
they have a strong case against him.
YOUTHFUL MERRYMAKER
RESCUED FROM THE BAY
Edward Lacy Goes on an Excursion
and Falls From a Moving
Launch.
A party of fifteen boys and girls liv
ing in the Mission and Potrero districts
hired a launch from the Peterson
Boating Company yesterday morning
for the purpose of making merry on
the bay. Hilarity increased as the day
passed, but all went well until El
Campo was reached. Then Ed Lacy
of 46 Caselli street fell overboard.
The launch was under full speed at
the time and as soon as it could be
stepped it returned to the spot were
Lacy was struggling in the water. .
It was with difficulty that the
ycung man was rescued. Despite the
fact that lines and grappling hooks
were brought into service he remained
in the water at least five minutes and
when he was finally taken aboard he
was unconscious and nearly dead.
With all possible speed the launch was
hurried back to this city and the un
conscious lad taken to the Harbor
Hospital. It required several hours to
revive him, but late last night the phy
sicians pronounced him out of danger.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBR-fjARY 6, 1905.
MAKE A FIGHT
IN THE LEAGUE
Leach and McElroy Are at
It Hammer and Tongs to
Obtain an Indorsement
COMPLICATIONS ARISE
Politicians r oii(ler Wlietlier
Eepiiblicdii Conference
Agreement Is to Stand
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Feb. 5.
Politics centers about the Munipical
L/eague Cpnventlpp Tuesday ni^ht.
The contest between A. P. Leach and
J. E. Mcelroy, the incumbent, lor in
dorsement by the league as candidate
lor City Attorney, absorbs the atten
tion of those rivals' friends amon^
the delegates. Kach man claims a
following large enough to win him the
coveted approving vote, lioth BCcÃl
roy and Leach havt been working at
tcp speed. The uays that will iaitir
pene beiove tne convention is again
call( d to order will sr.uw no lessening
of effort on the part of fciiher aspirant.
While this contest tends u> -some ex
tent; to overshadow other fights in the
league, a Question arose to-da.y ia
political centers that has awakened no
little 1 interest- as, to: the 'ultimate action
of that 'convention in its work of nam
ing a municipal | ticket. The question
is how , far could the ! executive com
mittee of the league pledge the con
vention â  to . accept the ' agreement made
as to indorsements of the j Hpublican
nominees chosen at last night's Repub
lican convention. . " ' v
It was asserted to-day that the
league committee accepted the names
conditionally and that the convention
as a whole would be privileged to take
them or reject them at its pleasure.
Complications are threatened if such
a move be made, as the Republican
convention accepted ths nominees pre
sented by its conference committee
without a change.
When George Samuels, chairman of
the Republican conference committee,
reported to the convention last night
he explicitly said agreement had been
reached upon the names he read. Act
ing upon that understanding the con
vention voted. Now comes the word
that the league side was without suf
ficient authority to settle definitely the
lines of agreement on candidates.
Whether this will force ail of the
nominees who desire league in
dorsement to go into that convention
and make a fight is the debated point
that is keeping alive concern in that
body's work.
Something of activity manifested
itself to-day in Union Labor party
circles on account of the clash be
tween rival candidates for the Mayor
alty nomination. George E. Ran
dolph, who was defeated at the Re
publican primaries for that party's
nomination for Mayor, has gone into
the Union Labor party ranks for the
honor. He is opposed by B. L. Bair,
who was defeated two years ago when
he ran for Mayor against Warren
Olney, the incumbent.
Randolph's followers assert that he
has the nomination in his pocket.
Bair's contingent say he will not only
be the man, but will be indorsed by
the Democrats as well.
Murray Laidlaw wants the Union
Labor nomination for City Treas
urer. G. E. Aitken expects the Union
Labor indorsement for Councilman at
large. The convention will be held
to-morrow night at Germanla Hall.
In the Democratic field all is
apathy. Their convention will be
held at Dletz Opera-house to-morrow
night. Candidates are scarce. Few
of the rank and file can be found
who desire to offer themselves upon
the altar of party fealty because of
the hopelessness of the fight from a
Democratic standpoint. Some of the
expectant nominees of other political
organizations are making an effort to
secure indorsements here in the hope
of picktng up a few hundred votes
on election day. The same situation
obtains with relation to the Union
Labor party.
The Socialists nominated the fol
lowing municipal ticket to-day:
Mayor, Jack London; City Attorney, Aus
tin Lewis; City Engineer, L. D. Mathews;
Auditor, A, N. Denlson; Treasurer, William

THIS ACTOR'S "PROPERTY"
HAS CAUSED HIS ARREST
Turkish Vaudeville Artist Falls Foul
of the Plain American Police
man in Alamcda.
ALAMEDA, Feb. 5. â Because he
carried a part of his "property" in
his pocket, and this "property" con
sisted of a small Derringer, Murat
Pasha, a Turkish acrobat, who is ap
pearing in the vaudeville houses
about the bay, was arrested to-day
on a charge of carrying concealed
weapons.
Pasha, with the two other members J
of his troupe, Rafael Hannum and â¢
Abdul Pasha, came over to "try out" j
before the manager of a local vaude- |
ville house. Their act calls for the I
use of blank cartridges.^ After they '
had left the theater the tffree engaged 1
in a friendly scuffle, in the course of !
which Murat Pasha drew his Der- j
ringer. A terrified woman who wit- â 
nessed the affair from her window '
telephoned the police that murder '
was about to be done, and the arrest
followed. It was necessary tp procure
an interpreter from San Francisco be
fore the man could tell the exact
truth of the matter, and he was then
released on his own recognizance.

You Like It" by Ben Greets players
under the oaks on the campus in
Strawberry canyon, next Saturday. In
event of rain the production will be

mittee. The ins'trurrents used by mu
sicians in Shakespeare's time will be
used by these performers.
More than passing interest is be-ing
displayed py the faculty and students
of the university in the sophomores'
production of a burlesque on "Ham
let" which is scheduled for presenta
tion at the Macdonough theater in
Oakland on February 17. The prin
cipal reason for the notice that has
been taken of the sophomorio burles
que effort is the rumor that has gone
abroad regarding the "joshing" to
which it is said prominent members
of the faculty will be subjected in the
"Hamlet" travesty.
TO BURLESQUE FACULTY.
Captain Nance, military instructor
is said to come In for some pointed
sallies, reminiscent of his affair with
the students last term, and other pro
fefesors have been handled, say the in
siders, with something not exactly akin
to reverence.
None but male students will appear
in the cast. Ophelia will be played
by one of the authors, Harold Clarke.
Grover O'Connor will be "Hamlet"
thoroughly up-to-date. Harry Leach
has the part of Claudius. Max Waiz
man will be Polonius, and Harry
Rogers Horatio. L H. Cromwell
has the part of Guildenstern and W.
N. Wright is to be "Rosencrantz."
Felipe Buencamino will appear as
Yusi, the Celestial cook for Ophelia,
a role invented especially for the occa
sion. All of these men have had ex
perience with college dramatic affairs.
The sophomore class has not, hitherto,
however, attempted anything of such
magnitude as this burlesque, having
been content in the past with minstrel
shows and the like.
The official title of the burlesque is
"Ham-am-a-let."
AGED SPANISH WOMAN
IS KILLED BY A CAR
Falls From a Sharp Decline Into the
Side of a Fast Moving
Vehicle.
A Spanish woman, apparently about
70 years of age and unknown to the
authorities, was fatally injured by an
electric car at the corner of Vallejo
and Sansoxne streets early last
evening. The woman was removed
to the Harbor Receiving Hos
pital immediately after the acci
dent. It is the opinion of the physi
cians that she was intoxicated. She
died while under treatment and noth
ing is known of her Identity. The
body was removed to the Morgue.
According to the statement of John
Watson, the motorman, the car was
running northbound. When near San
some and Vallejo streets he observed a
woman standing on a slope about four
feet from the track. Believing the
woman to be In a safe position, he
passed along, but when the center of
his car reached the place where the
woman was standing she suddenly
plunged forward and struck the side
of the car. Watson applied his brakes
as quickly as possible and stopped
within a short distance. He at once
telephoned to the hospital and the am
bulance was sent to the place. At the
hospital the physicians found the
woman was suffering from a fractured
skull, in addition to many bruises. She
died without having regained con
sciousness.

: â¢ Interest in the political battle which
! has just ended in Oakland and con
tinued rains have caused a lull in the
local real estate market during the last
: week, although several dealers report
|an increase in . the j inquiry f or , amall,
Improved residence property. A large
percentage of those making inquiries
! for residence property are prepared to
1 pay cash : for suitable locations and
wish- to . purchase as /quickly as pos
sible. These conditions indicate that
the early summer market will be un
1 usually brisk. - â¢
The demand for small houses and
centrally located flats for rent exceeds
the - supply, despite the large number
of buildings of this class which were
erected last year. Prospective renters,
many of whom are residents of San
Francisco, are ? not confining their
search .to Oakland, but are seeking
houses on the lines :of the street rail
ways in Berkeley, Alameda and Fruit
vale. In 1904 nearly one hundred
small houses and cottages were erected
in .: the . Sather district. Just east of
Fruitvale station, , and nearly all of
I these have been 1 sold. or rented.
TO OPEN TRACT.
A company has been incorporated
with a capital stock of $200,000, its
purpose being to open up several large
tracts in the Claxemont district.
Forty thousand dollars of the capital
stock has already been subscribed by
the following directors of the new
company:
J. H. Spring of Fruitvale. $11,000; Wick
ham Havens of Oakland, 910,000; Duncan Mc-
Duffle of Oakland. $8000; Louis Titus of Berke
ley, $10,000, and W. E. CreÂ«d of Oakland.
fioo.
The records of the sanitary inspec
tor's office show that seventy-eight
new buildings were erected within the
city limits of Oakland during the
month of January, fifty-eight of these
being single dwellings, seventeen flats
and three stores. As the first month
of the year is generally very dull in
building circles, this record is satisfac
tory to those interested in the growth
ot the city. Sanitary Inspector Stew
art Gemmel says that from what he
has recently learned of the placa of a
number of the leading contractors and
builders of Oakland for the present
year that fully 1500 new buildings will
be erected in this city during tha next
twelve months.
William J. Laymance of the Lay
mance Real Estate Company is con
fident that 1905 will break all the rec
ords of previous years as regards the
sale of Oakland real estate. Mr. Lay
mance said to-day:
We have now more than $100,000 worth of
miscellaneous sales under contract, approved
by sellers and purchasers, who are awaiting
the examination of titles. The continuous
bad weather has had a depressing effect on
the market during the last week, but from
the number of inquiries received by us !n
January I feel safe In predicting a splendid
spring and summer market.
BUSINESS BLOCK SALES.
The E. P. Vandercook Company has
recently closed a contract for the sale
of a large centrally located business
block, and they are also offering a
number of excellent residence proper
ties in various parts of the city. As
with other firms, business has been
quiet with the Vandercook Company
during the week.
Holcomb, Breed & Bancroft have
found a ready market for residence
property located on the lines of the
Key Route f erry system, in North Oak
land. They are now offering a large
number of villa sites and building lots
In that district
Taylor Brothers & Co. report a lull
in business last week. Too much
politics and rain. They have just of
fered for sale several excellent busi
ness properties close to the center of
the city.
Albert S. Day, formerly with Hol
comb, Breed & Bancroft, has recently
gone into business for himself. His of
fices are located In the Central Bank
building, and he has just obtained con
tracts for the sale of some fine resi
dence property In Piedmont and North
Oakland.
J. Tyrel will soon remove to his new
offices at 1010 Broadway.
REGENTS LJET CONTRACT.
The regents of the University of
California have awarded the contract
for the plumbing and water system in
the new California building on the uni
versity grounds to William F. Wilson
& Co. The cost of the work will
be $5363.

a quiet week on account of the bad
weather.

meda have Just placed on the market 4
number of excellently located unim
proved residence lots situated close to

the past week has been quiet as far
as actual business is concerned, but
that there has been a decided Increase
in the direct inquiries for advertised
property. Mr. Pleitner has secured the
handling of some of the best property
in the eastern suburb and predicts an
active spring and summer market.

The voice of the man who would
rather right than President can be
heard in the land during any political
ampai^^-. 1 Hlb name is legion. In all
ihe wide world, however, there Is prob
ably but one man who would rather be
pilot than potentate; only one king who
has doffed crown for an oilskin hat
and whose fingers have released their
grip of a scepter to grasp the spokes of
â  steering wheel. His name is Kala
nlwahinleonkalua and in Tahiti, where
he now lives, they call him "Cap" for
short. The etory of the royal pilot
came up on the Mariposa.
"Cap" was the ruler of the island of
< Â»tafu. From deep sea on the north to
deep sea. on the south, from western
to eastern extremity of the little king
dom, he was monarch of all, over-lord
to a host of chocolate colored subjects
and husband of all the dusky brides
he cared to claim. He had first whack
at the revenues derived from the sale
of the island's products, lived under
the bigpest cocoanut palm in the land,
and in all councils, at every social func
tion, Kalaniwahinleonkalua was "It."
The pomps and vanity of court eti
quette wearied the monarch. He longed
to do something. According to Captain
Lawless of the liner Mariposa, he is
now doing It.
A few weeks ago the King of Otafu
laid down his scepter, hove his boiler
plate crown into the surf, kissed his
bride 6 good-by. Jumped aboard the
flagship of his navy and paddled to
Tahiti.
Vice Consul Ducarron at Papeete is

etay at Morea is brief, it is usually
after 10 p. m. before she gets back.

MYSTERIOUS
DEATH OF A
MINISTER
Enters Lodging-House With
Stylishly Dressed Veiled
Woman and Drops Dead
After Being Shown Room
COMPANION TAKES
HURRIED DEPARTURE
Gold Wateli Is Taken From
Body While Landlady of
House Is Absent in Quest
of Medical Assistance
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 5. â The death
of Rev. C. E. Bentley of Lincoln.
1 Neb., in a lodging-house at 125 South
Los Angeles street last night, has fur
nished a case somewhat puzzljng to
the police.
Rev. Mr. Bentley, according to the
story told by Mrs. Douglass, proprie
tress of the lodging-house, which is
located in the section known as the
East Side lodging-house district, ap
plied for a room about 8 o'clock Sat
urday night. He was accompanied by
, stylishly dressed woman, who wore a
thick, black veil. The landlady show
ed them to a rpom and while she was
turning on the light, Bentley dropped
to the floor unconscious. The woman
who accompanied him told the land
lady to go for water, which Â»he did.
When she returned a moment later
the mysterious woman had disap
. peared. Mrs. Douglass then went to
seek assistance, but returning a faw
j moments later found a young: man
named Haines, a lodger, holding Bent
, ley's head. He left, saying he was go
1 ing for a doctor, but has not been seen
since. Mrs. Bentley finally sum
moned the police, but Bentley was
; dead.
The body was removed to the
Morgue late Saturday night and was
I not mt itifled until early Sunday morn
ing. When search of Bentley's cloth
| Ing was made it was found that his
i gold watch was missing and that his
, pockets contained only $1 05 in cash.
An autopsy was held to-day and it
; was found that death was due to heart
disease.
The police are seeking the mysteri
ous veiled woman who accompanied
Bentley, and, while they do not think
she ie in any way responsible for his
death, they would like to learn who
she is and why she was in Bentley's
company.
Bentley and his wife arrived in Los
Angeles last Friday and took apart
ments at 300 Olive street. Bentley was
candidate for the Presidency on the
Prohibition ticket in the campaign of
1Â£96 and three times the Prohibition
candidate for United States Senator
from Nebraska. He was 64 years old
and had lived in Nebraska for twenty
five years.
LINCOLN, Neb., Feb. s.â Rev. C. E.
Bentley was for many years a resident
of Nebraska. He began his ministerial
[ work in Nebraska and for twenty years
was pastor of one church at Sui prise.
He leaves a wife and six grown chil-
I dren. He left Lincoln for the West
; January 23. The body will be brought
I to Lincoln for burial.
MIRACULOUS ESCAPE
FROM DEATH BY CHILD
IJttle Girl Steals Ride on Cable, Is
Crashed Between Wheel and
Floor and Lives.
CHICO, Feb. s.â The 9-year-old
daughter of Horace Mecum, a sawyer
at Campbell's Mill, thirty miles from
here, miraculously escaped death Sat
urday. In imitation of older children
she undertook to ride on a cable by
grasping it with both hands and
holding on with feet upraised from
the floor until within a few feet from
the big wheel around which the wire
was stretched. She did not let go in
time and wag dragged into the space
between the floor and the wheel.
So small was the space that the lit
tle one's frail body stopped the ma
chine, but when she was extricated it
was found that her only injury was a
crushed hand. Amputation was
necessary. The child stood the shock
and will live.

forth from above the altar in soft in
candescent lights.
After the mass the visiting knights
were escorted to Cathedral Hall, where
a substantial luncheon was served by
the Catholic women of Sacramento.
The hall was tastefully decorated with
wreaths of smilax, ferns and potted
plant 6, and the emblem of the order
was displayed |n colored electric lights.
After luncheon the delegates marched
to Serra Hall, where the initiation of
the charter members of Sacramento
Council took place. The first and sec
ond degrees of the order were conferred
upon the neophytes by Grand Orgon
izer Neil Power of San Francisco. The

MURDERED NEAR
HER RESIDENCE
Woman in Allegheny Found
Dead in the Back Yard of
an In occupied Dwelling
PITTSBURG, Feb. s.â Mrs. John
Kirkpatrick was found dead to-day in
the back yard of an unoccupied house
at No. 9 Jackson street, Allegheny,
only a short distance from her home.
She had been murdered.
For several months Mrs. Kirkpatrick
has been living at the residence of Mrs.
Jessie Scott on Jackson street, with
her husband and 18-months-old babe.
Last night she took her baby to her
mother's home on Isabella street so.
she could attend to some marketing.
Her husband was to have met her at
the Isabella street house at 10 o'clock,
but when he failed to keep the ap
pointment she started for her home
with her purchases, intending to re
turn for the child. After leaving the
street car near her home she was seen
talking to a tall man wearing a high
hat and long overcoat. A few mo
ments later she was evidently dragged
into Creighton alley, where she was
heard to exclaim: "Oh, don't; I'll do
anything you" say."
When the body was discovered to
day at 1 o'clock it was found that the
woman had been choked to death and
traces in the snow showed that she had
been dragged twelve feet along the al
ley to the yard gate and thrown in
side. A family at 13 Jackson- street
heard the scuffling and quarreling in
the alley, but being newcomers in the
neighborhood decided not to interfere
in any way.
Mrs. Kirkpatrick's assailant is sup
posed to be some man who was at
least an acquaintance of hers because
during the evening a person answering
the description of the man seen talk
ing to her called twice at the Scott
house and asked for Mattie (the wo
man's first name) and appeared to be
an old friend.
Late to-night the police arrested
Norman Geyer, a boardmarker in a
local broker's office, and are holding
him on the charge of murder. â  Devel
opments show that Geyer had been an
admirer of Mrs. Kirkpatrick for sev
eral years before her marriage and for
a time was the cause of an estrange
ment between Kirkpatrick and his wife.
The trouble had been smc ithed over
and the couple were living happily to
gether, but last week Mrs. Kirkpat
rick, it is said, complained to her hus
band that Geyer was annoying her by
following her on the streets and per
sisting in talking to her.
When arrested to-night a bloodstain
was found on Geyer's overcoat sleeve
and the knuckles of his right hand
were cut, the abrasions being such, the
physicians say, as would be made by
the sharp edges of human teeth.
It was found that several of the mur
dered woman's teeth had been knocked
out.

PORTLAND, Feb. s.â More sensa

prominence will be returned this week,
it â¢is expected, by the Federal Grand
Jury in : â¢ connection .with the land

ments will ' be. made, it is said, as the
outcome of the jury's investigations
into scrip issued for lands : included in
the .Blue Mountain forest reserve , in

Central 'Oregon. " ..'
Other indictments are to be returned,

United, States. District Attorney Fran
cis J. Heney is satisfied tie has evidence
against 'sufficient; to connect . with the
extensive . land ': frauds of which the
Government contends it has been made

' Next Saturday -.the; jury will make its
final report and be discharged for the
term. In case it = not able to finish
its work the succeeding Grand Jury,
which will be drafted at the spring term
of court, will' conclude the ' investiga
tions. â ' -; .; ' :â¢ ; %
The abrupt termination of the work

DOCTORS OF DUBUQUE
ORGANIZE A TRUST
Propose to Compel Payment of Five
Thousand n Year to County
Physician.
DI'BUQUE, lowa, Feb. 5. â Deter
mfti'efl to make the county pay liber
ally for medical services rendered the
indigent, a majority of the doctors of
Dubuque have signed an agreement
that they will not accept the position
of county physician for less than
$5000 a year. The Board of Super
visors is in a quandary as to what
action to take, But the doctors declare
that they will stand fat and if the
board refuses to accede to their de
mands the dependents may have to go
without medical treatment.
It has been found, however, that in
assuming such ah attitude the physi
cians have virtually formed a trust in
asmuch as they seÂ»k to restrain com
petition and create a monopoly. As
the State code denominates such a
practice as a conspiracy, unless the
doctors change their position the mat
ter may be carried to the courts.

FINE BEGINNING OF THE TRADE YEAR.
THE commercial showing of the country last week continued ex
cellent. There was less restriction of distribution and trans
portation on account of inclement weather, and the statistical
returns all indicated an expanding condition of trade. The record
for Januar\- in this respect was much better than that of January,
.4. and presage^ another year of pronounced activity. 1 here was
a general gain all along the line, in bank clearings, railway earnings,
foreign export and import trade, distribution of merchandise, etc.
mtry weather hampered several branches of industry, such as the
â vernent of lumber, building operations, etc.. but the great staples
as a rule were reported in active and expanding movement, and at
maintained prices.
The clearings for the week were $2,752,000,000, and were 28.2
per cent larger than in January, 1904. New York gained 44 per
cent, Pittsburg 39.6 per cent, Chicago 13.7 per cent, and so on. The
failures were 259, against 246 last year, and the railway earnings
were slightly ahead of the corresponding period of 1904. San Fran
, isco made an exceptionally fine showing in bank clearings in Jan
. the gain over the opening month last year being $ii.000,000.
' The iron and steel trade is making a very gratifying showing at
present, the furnaces and steel mills running to almost their full ca
pacity, with abundant orders booked ahead. Xo unfavorable reports
art being received from the textile mills or footwear factories of New
gland or the Middle States. Labor troubles are few and local.
The woolen trade, both as to manufactured goods and the raw
product, is reported in excellent condition. The cotton industry is
not only showing less depression, but a better' feeling seems to be
developing. Prices, however, are low, owing to the enormous pro
duction last year, and will probably continue so until the vast hold
ings are worked off into consumption. Provisions, though quiet at
Western primary points, show no depression, and ihe outgo pro
gresses favorably. Satisfactory activity is noted in hides and leather.
Affairs in Wall street are moving along without friction. The
money market continues easy at low rates of interest, in spite of
gold exports to the amount of Si 1. 000.000 to Paris during the past
len days. There is no undue speculation, but a good demand for
standard stocks and bonds. The market shows persistent buoy
ancy, which nothing seems to seriously disturb. Occasional rece^
ife almost immediately succeeded by healthy reactions, and
the public are investing with more or less freedom. As recently
mentioned, however, stocks have lately been passing out of a few
strong hands into many scattered weak ones, and the ultimate effect
of this change in conditions is becoming the subject of more or less
conjecture.
In California the conditions could hardly be improved. From
the farmer's standpoint the crop season has thus far been ideal.
Copious and frequent rains have wet the State from San Diego to
the Oregon line, and. in fact, the northern half has received such a
saturation that farm work has been suspended in many sections,
A large area has been seeded to grain this year, and the growing
plant looks well everywhere. With the usual spring rains we should
harvest very large crops, and as high prices for wheat, barley, oats
and corn are now ruling, it is reasonable to expect that the Califor
nia farmer will enjoy another excellent year, both as to volume of
crop and prices. Stocks of grain, wool, hops, dried and canned fruits
are better cleaned up than for years, and the new crops will come in
upon practically bare markets. Money is remarkably plentiful, both
in city and interior banks, and solvent borrowers have no difficulty
in raising all the funds they need at rates of interest which certainly
are not exorbitant.
With the above conditions before us we see no reason to ex
pect anything but a fine year. That this is the general sentiment is
<hown by the continued activity in real estate, the widespread erec
tion of costly new buildjngs. the expansiun of electrical transporta
tion lines all over the State, the full employment of labor at con
tinued high wages, and the prevailing disposition to embark in new
undertakings. Looking back twelve months we find commercial and
industrial conditions visibly better than at this time in 1904, which
itself was a most excellent year.
THE CONTROL OF FORESTS.
THE West will read with satisfaction the transfer of forest parks '
and reserves from the Interior Department to the Forestry
Bureau of the Agricultural Department, of which Mr. Gifford
Pinchot is chief. Mr. Pinchot is not a narrow theorist like too many
of the Interior Department official?. He knows the forest and its
proper administration, practically. He is aware of the economic
\^lue of the forest, for the conservation of moisture, the modification j
â¢ â¢I climate and the proper production of timber for use.
We ma}' now expect to enter upon the training of all the people ;
the proper use of forests. It must be widely taught, demon- i
m rated and made known that every forest tract can be made the \
permanent producer of forest wealth. Trees have their period of :
growth and of ripening. When ripe they may be harvested without
injury to the forest of which they are a part. The forest area of
California, under proper treatment, can be greatly enlarged for the
benefit of future generations. We venture the prediction that own
ers of large forest tracts in this State will finally and gladly adopt
Mr. Pinchot's policy of making the forest permanent. Practical men
are always willing to listen to a man who knows what he is talking
about, and Mr. Pinchot is such a man.
Incidentally this transfer of administration to him is an argu
ment for the re-cession of the^Yosemite Valley. W r e can imagine no
happier thing to befall that great valley than to pass it into his
hands. It will be administered with a view to the preservation of
all its geological and dendrological beauties, and far the comfort and
enjoyment of those who visit it. The next visit of Mr. Pinchot to
this State will be eagerly anticipated by the lovers of the forest, who
will hail him as one entering into his kingdom.
OAKLAND WATER FINANCE.
THE Contra Costa Water Company has made its annual report
for the year 1904. The figures are very interesting to the people
of Oakland just now. The company received from all sources in
the Oakland division, which includes the city of Oakland and all the
country served below the tap to Alameda and Berkeley, the sum of
$660,972 99.
It paid out in taxes on the same division $60,667 63, in operating
expenses $148,357 20, in interest $242,042 81, a total of $451,067 64,
leaving a balance of only $209,905 35. This does not look as though
water is very profitable after all. nor as though the city will be able
to do much by putting a competing plant in the field. When private
corporations, administered with economy, go as many years without
paying dividends as the Contra Costa has, the prospects of a munici
pal plant are not brilliant. We think the Contra Costa Company has
passed more dividends than it has paid from the beginning of its
operations.
THE PRESS OF THE NATION.
The tendency of the various railroads in this country is toward a com

WHAT A HAND MAY MEAN
In all my experience and thoughts I
am conscious of a hand. Whatever
touches me, whatever thrills me, is as
a hand that touches me in the dark,
and that touch is my reality. You
might as well say that a sight which
makes you glad or a blow which brings/
the stinging tears to your eyes is un
real as to say that those impressions
are unreal which I have accumulated
by means of touch. The delicate
tremble of a butterfly's wings in my
hand, the soft petals of violets curling
in the cool folds of their leaves .or lift
ing sweetly out of the meadow grass,
the clear, firm outline of face and limb,
the smooth arch of a horse's neck and
the velvety touch of his nose â all these,
and a thousand resultant combinations,
which take shape in my mind, con
stitute my world.â Helen Keller in the
Century.

BIG FAMILIES
OF THE
OLDEN DATS
The north of England seems to be a
fertile soil for large families, for in
1797 we read of a Cumberland man
and his wife, accompanied by thirty
of their children, all attending the
christening of the ihirty-flrst child,
and in earlier years another north
countryman, Thomas Greenhill. ap
plied to the then Duke of Norf<alk,
early marshal, for an augmentation to
his coat of arms on the singular
ground that he was "the seventh son
and thirty-ninth child of one father
and mother."
In Conway churchyard thqre was to
be seen â it can scarcely be there to
day â a tombstone bearing the follow
ing remarkable epitaph: "Here lyeth
the body of Nicholas Hocker of Con
way, gentleman, who was the forty
first child of his father., William
Hocker, by Alice, his wife, and the
father of twenty-seven children, 1637."
If a man's family be considered as
including all his descendants that of
Peter Smith, who flourished in New
Jersey in the seventeenth century, is
entitled to a high place of honor, for
at a recent annual gathering of Peter's
progeny no fewer than 7000 met and
dined, together under the apple trees in
the orchard attached to the ancestral
homestead.
In families it is not an unknown
thing for one child to be old enough
to have a sister or brother young
enough to be his or her great-grand
child. Thus the eldest son of Thomas
Beatty of Drumcondra has passed his
seventy-third birthday when his
youngest brother qualified for the
cradle. When Wiliam Frost of Gal
phay, near Ripon. died" in 1789 his eld
est child was a sturdy boy of 88 sum
mers and his youngest was barely 16
and the Lady Powerscourt of to-day is
half a" century older than her latest
brother.
There are cases on record where a
century or more has divided the wed
ding days of father and son. The first
Earl of Leicester was first married In
1775 and his son led his second wife
to the altar in August. 1875; while
Captain Francis Maude, who was mar
ried on June 28, 1849, was following
the example his father, Lord Haw
arden, had set him ninety-three years
earlier in 1756. But both these cases
are quite eclipsed by that of General
G. Stevenson of Bristol, who v/hs
united to his third wife in 1834 at the,
age of 82, and whose father was first
-wed In 1704, the year of Blenheim.
This seeming impossibility is ac
counted for by the fact that the father,
who was born in 1680, was married for
the third time at the age of 70, and
the general was the son of this late
union. Thus we get the remarkable re
sult of a man whose father was born
in Charles ll's reign wooing and wed
ding within the memory of many peo
ple- still living. â London Tit-Bits.
THE ETERNAL MASCULINE
At seventeen we meet some girl
We worship fond and deep.
And beg from her a tiny curl
We o'er ;md aye may keep.
" 'Tis thin-spun gold." we ardent swear,
"A mesh of filigree."
And fondly kiss and hide it where
No prying eye may see.
At twenty-seven, less enthused
With auburn-tinted curls.
We. finding it, grow much confused
To recollect which girl's
Fair head it lent a halo to â
Mar. Kate or Prue. the dears â
"Well, pshaw! the thing that's best to do
Is, keep it ten more years!"
At thirty-seven, then, one day
While rummaging, we stare
In absent way at it and say,
"The devil' Win, so rod hair
Is this? It ne'er belonged to me! â
The bricky stuff!" Ah. Fate! â
We toss it forth, and smile to see
It crinkle in the grate.

A WORD TO BOYS
IN LOVE.
DOROTHY FENIMORE
*T^' HAT lovers' vow, "I would die
you," sounds as if it were
dMv something fine. There is an
aroma of self-sacrifice about it which
is calculated to tickle the nose of a god
dess who is enjoying her first season
on the Olympian heights of social popu
larity.
But why, pray, should a girl want a
man to die for her? It is plainly more
to her interest to keep him to run
errands, to sit out dances with her on
a moonlight night or to write her ten
der letters when she is lonely.
Dying is a decidedly cheap way of
showing devotion. Anybody can do it.
And those who proclaim themselves
heroes in advance are not the ones
with whom it is safe to go to the
theater on gallery tickets.
I would feel more complimented to
have a man wapt to live for me. And
though I should ntit feel insulted if a
man whom I had refused to marry
had spunk enough to try conspicuously
to show me he cbuld live ir. spite of
me, I* should not feel so certain that
the love which I had refused was worth
accepting. For if he felt for a minute
that "there are just as good fish in the
sea," he could not -have been really in
love.
A brave man is not afraid of the
future because the present hurts him.
He goes on his way with his head up
and does the best he can. And if he
has been irremediably disappointed in
love he treasures tn the quiet places
of his heart the belief: "The loye I
offered her waa the flower of my life.
I am proud of It. It Is no common
thing. And I'll not let It wither in the
dust." So he puts his love to good
uses.
Do you not know some man who is liv
ing for the girl he loved in his youth,
but did not marry? I know such a one.
He was described to me the other day
as "a friendly kind of a lonely fellow."
His little unobtrusive acts of kindness
to friends and strangers make the
world a happier place for many people
in it. Thus every day he payÂ» homage
to the woman â¢whom he loves, and is
better for it. And surely it must be
sweet to her to know â as I think she
does â that he loves her in so generous
a way; and she, in turn, must be the
better for it.
So much for the man's vow, "I would
die for you." With the boy who loves
and wants to die I have more sym
pathy; though I really can't help it if
my lips smile over the matter while
my eyes weep. There is just a step
between a smile and a tear, you know â
right over the bridge of the nose.
Boys are so terribly in earnest that
now and then their emotions need a
straitjacket. They have not learned
what it takes years of experience to
itarn. that human beings, like cats,
have many lives â that we die over and
over and ovir again before there comes
to us at last the end of this life, and
cessation of mortal suffering. They
despair, without knowing what time
only can teach them, that despair Is
just hope gone to sleep for a while,
presently to awake with all the fresh
strength that eornes with the morning.
Boyhood's sorrows are genuine and
deep â while they last â but the ex
pression of them is not always sincere.

THE SAN -FRANCISCO CALL, MONDAY, FEBRUARY 0-, 1905
CLUB WOMEN ARE TO MEET
IN CITY OF LOS ANGELES
LAURA BRIDE POWERS
There'll be a merry chatter at the
Third street depot this morning, when
a hundred or more clubwomen and
their friends set out for Los Angeles,
where an exciting engagement awaits
themâ for know ye all that whatever
clubwomen undertake they go Into with
spirit. Nothing they do is dull, though
it may be weird. And there promise to
be no dull moments in the three days
of activityâ what with enjoying the
charming hospitality offered by the
clubwomen of the southland and the
skirmishes, charges and countercharges
on the floor of the convention.
As to the latter, the forces will con
centrate upon the elimination of the
word "woman's" fromejthe official title
of the State Federation. Why? To let]
the men come In, of course. The hu- j
\ morous side of the situation is that the ,
i men don't want to come in â that is,
most men don't. Not that they depre- i
cate the value of women's clubsâ not
thatâ but they seem rather a unit in
deciding that the activities in most
women's clubs are cut to fit feminine
minds,
True, in civic clubs men are ofttimes
needed to "back up" the work of the
women. But the help is always forth
coming, cheerfully and vigorously. And
not a jot is lost because the dear men
are not on the club roll. Why, bless
you, ladies, if you want the men to
come in wait a little, until we learn a
few things about logical sequence and
the economy of time and -the sig
nificance of words. What a good laugh
the men would have on us if they knew
some of the funny things we do â and
say! Cheer up, ladies! We're learning,
and doing pretty well for beginners.
But let us stay as "women's clubs" un
til we grow our wisdom teeth, then we
can broaden intelligently.
What the outcome of the skirmish
will be is problematical, as it is whis
pered that the clubwomen in the south

At the meeting of the Outdoor Art
League on January 30 Mrs. E. H.
Kemp, a resident of San Francisco,
but for some time past sojourning in
England, gave a very interesting ad
dress on various phases and features
of outdoor life in that country. She
described the characteristics of Eng
lish outdoor art work, including the
ai nual flower show, which is held in
the open air instead of in halls, as in
this country; the May day festivities,
the botanical gardens of Oxford Uni
versity and the extensive use of hedges
to mark property lines instead of
fences. The very general use of pretty
vines for the adornment of the outer
walls of both public and private build
ings waa also commented upon, with
the suggestion that such floral adorn
ment is practicable in San Francisco
wherever stone or brick is used in con
struction with even better results than
in England.
pn Sunady, January 29, many mem
bers of the league enjoyed their first
celebration of Carnation day by at
tending special services in the Third
Congregational Church, commemora
tive of the late President McKinley.
The pastor, Rev. Dr. Rader, delivered
a forecful sermon on "Building of
Character." The league hopes to have
a fitting and more general observance
of, this anniversary day each year.
The chairman of the seed committee
has begun the usual yearly work of
distributing seeu- to the various hos
pitals and public institutions and
among school children. The demand
is large and additional supplies^ill be
asked from the Department of Agri
culture at Washington.

Here's a story of what some good
women are doing, and It's about the
Toadies of the Grand Army of the Re
public:
On the 12th of this month, Mrs.
Martha Herrich of 978 Geary street,
department president of the organiza
tion, with Mrs. Miller of the board of
lady managers, and Mrs. Spencer of
Los Angeles will meet to crystallize
one of the sweetest tasks that women
of the hour have set for themselves. It
is best told in the language of the
president:
"The ladies are preparing to go to
Sawtelle, where the president has se
cured a beautiful plat of ground near
the Soldiers' Home. Upon this they
will proceed to erect one of a series
of cottages for the old soldier and his
wife, that the comrade and his wife
be not parted in their old age.
"Our Governmen^Uias aone a noble
thing in building 'Sluliers; Homes' for
the heroes who offered their lives for
the unity of the nation, but it works
a hardship upon them, when overtaken
by age and unable to support their
aged helpmates, they are forced to
part from them, that too great a bur
den be not placed upon the children or
contributing relatives.
"Now many of these women worked
on the farm or took in washing, sew
ing or anything their willing hands
found to do to support themselves and
little ones while they offered up lives
dearer than their own in defense of
old glory. Was not their sacrifice as
great as that borne by the soldiers?
Then let us as a grateful people help
them to live their declining days to
gether undivided as is this republic
to-day.
"1 was told at the home that many
old comrades died of pure homesick
ness when separated from their life
lÂ»np; companions. And we as an or
ganization are going to try to keep
them together by this cottage plan,
choosing the south for our cottages as
better adapted to the aged.
"Mrs. Abbie E. Krebs, department
chairman of the home committee, will
accompany the president as represent
ative of George H. Thomas Circle, with
power to let a contract for a double
cottage to be named George H. Thomas
Cottage No. 32. SeVeral of the other
circles will build cottages named for
their own circles, while some soldiers'
widows have spoken of erecting a
memorial cottage, naming the same
for their husbands.
"What could be a nobler offering to
the hero who has passed to the great
beyond than a memorial cottage to
mako happier some old comrades' de
clining days?"
TUMORSJONQUERED
SERIOUS OPERATION AVOIDED
Unqualified Success of Lydia K. Pink
ham's Vegetable Compound In thÂ«
Case of Mrs. Fannie D. Fox.
One of the greatest triumphs of Lrdia
I E. Pinkhams Vegetable Compound is
1 the conquering of woman's dread en-
emy. Tumor.
â The growth of a tumor is so slj that
frequently its presence is not suspected
until it is far advanced.
So-called "wandering pains" may
come from its early stages, or the
presence of danger may be made mani-
fest by profuse menstruation, accom-
panied by unusual pain, from the i
ovaries down the groin and thighs.
If you have mysterious pains, if there
are indications of inflammation or dis-
placement, don't wait for time to con-
I firm your fears and go, through the
j horrors of a hospital operation; secure
I Lydia B. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
j pound right away and begin its use.
Pinkham, of Lynn, Mass., will
give you her advice free of all charge
if you will write her about yourself.
Your letter will be seen by women only. ;
Dear Mrs. Pinkham : â
" I take the liberty to congratulate you on
the success I have had with your wonderful
medicine. Eighteen months ago my month-
lies stopped. Shortly after I felt so badly that
I submitted to a thorough examination by a
physician and was told that I had a tumor
on the uterus and would have to undergo an
operation.
" Soon after I read one of vpur advertise-
ments and decided to give Lydia E. Pink-
ham's Vegetable Componnd a trial. Aftar i
frying firo bottles as directed the tumor ia i
entirely gone. I have been examined by a
physician and he says I have no signs of a
tumor now. It has also brought my month-
lies around onca more, and I am entirely
well.*'â Fannie' D. Fox, 1 Chestnut Street,

Model Yaclite on Spreokels Lake.
A good wind prevailed at Spreckels
Lake, Golden Gate Park", yesterday,
but it was from the wrong direction
to permit of official races being held
by the owners of miniature yachts, as
a course could not be obtained. Many
oi th# models present came together in
practice spins and the yachtsmen were
by no means disappointed. In the
numerous races held J. Brannon's Alice
and M. London's Cricket divided the
henors. Each won eight races. M.
Johnson was out for the first time with
a new sloop. The new boat, which has
not been named, made a favorable im
pression.
The other boats which won at least
one race were W. B. Collier's Fannie,
Doyle's Don and J. Hay's Amelia.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL', MONDAY, FEBRUARY 6, 1905.
HANDBALL CUP
FOR OLYMPIANS
Artistic 3lelrose Trophy Is
Captured by the Clever
Wearers of Winged "o*'
FOUR GAMES STRAIGHT
Lose but Two Contests Out
of the Nineteen Played
V\) to the Present Time
The artistic silver cup offered by
Kenneth Melrose for the club winning
the most handball games in the inter-
ciub tournament will repose in the |
trophy case of the Olympic Club. The I
team wearing the winged "O," com- â 
posed of George James, Henry Cory,
Louis Levy and George Cunningham
have won seventeen out of nineteen
games played. By winning four games
yesterday, the Olympic Club team
clinched its hold on the cup. From
now on the men will play for individual
raedals which will be awarded by the ,
Pacific Athletic Association, under
whose, auspices the games have been
played.
All the players are suffering from
injured hands. The long siege of train
ing has also had its effect and many
of them are beginning to ease up in
their arduous work. The Olympic
Club men have been trained by Roger
Cornell and it is due to his splendid
care that the team has won.
The games playAl yesterday were
witnessed by a big crowd. Members
of the St. Ignatius, Occidental and
Olympic clubs sat in the capacious
galleries at the Olympic Club and
cheered the players for their clever
work.
The opening game was played by
Louis Levy of the Olympic Club and
Willie Canavan of the Occidental
Athletic Club. Levy won by a score
of 51 to 24. Canavan played a good
game and showed up strongly at the
finish. Levy did some clever "killing"
and his returns were hard enough to
put Canavan's hands out of business.
George James, of the Olympic Club,
played a splendid game against Tom
Lydon, beating the St. Ignatius Club
man by the score of 51 to 30. James
was in great form and outplayed his
opponent.
Henry Cory had no trouble beating
Charles Wilgus. Cory is the Olympic
Club crack and he toyed with Wilgus.
The latter is new to the game, but
has the making of a good player.
Score, 51 to 4.
George Cunningham of the Olympic
Club outplayed W. Skelly of the Occi
dental Club. Cunningham tired from
his exertions toward the end of the
game and Skelly began to roll up
points. Cunningham, however, held
him safely and won as he pleased.
Score, ol to 24.
The games were refereed by H. E.
("ahalan of the Occidental Club and
were scored by August F. Fick.
The following games will be played
next Thursday night at the Occidental
<!Ã¼b: Joe. Condon vs. George Cun
ningham; Tom Lydon vs. Henry Cory;
Rkelly vs. Leach, and Canavan vs. Wil
gus.
Fair Tennis Players at Stanford.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Feb. 5.â
The women of the university begin
active training for tennis to-morrow
morning. While the requirements will
not be as severe as those exacted from
the football players in the fall, yet the
girls will endeavor to do without those
things which are likely to interfere
with their tennis playing abilities. An
open tournament, which is to include
all of the young ladies of the univer
sjty, is to be held on the 25th of this
month. The winners of these contests
will play for the three places on the
team which will meet the girls. of the
University of California. This intercol
legiate match will in all probability be
played on the 9th of April on the Stan
ford courts.
The Stanford team is weakened this
year . because of the failure of Miss
Forbes to return to college. She was
one of the best players on the cardinal
courts for years. There are, however,
still three other players of intercol
legiate experience. They are Miss Rary,

/BLAME FOR MAN'S DEATH
Returns a Verdict Declaring Indian
Guilty of the Murder of Wil
lows Rancher.
WILLOWS, Feb. 5. â The jury sum
moned to inquire into the death of A.
J. Ketchum, a rancher; rendered a
verdict holding Wesley Hlmbogardy,
an Indiart living near Elk Creek, re
sponsible for the murder. A week
ago Ketchum was found bleeding to
death in his lonely mountain cabin
west of Elk Creek. To his rescuers he
said that on the previous day he was
trailed from his cabin by the accused
Indian and shot at four times. He
managed to crawl to his cabin, where
he lay for twenty-six hours before dis
covered, although in his conscious
moments he kept up a continual cry
for assistance. Medical aid was
provided, but the man's strength was
too far gone to combat the blood
poison which set in.
The Indian is now confined in the
County Jail. He spends his time play
ing solitaire with seemingly no fear
of the consequences of his terrible
deed. The members of his tribe have
raised money to conduct a defense. A
sister of the deceased now living In
San Francisco has wired, asking that
the remains be sent to her.
NON-UjriON MEX SUE
MIXERS' ORGANIZATION
Men Dismissed in Alabama Ask Dam
ages to the Amount of
$146,000.
TUSCALOOSA, Ala-, Feb.
ty-one suits, amounting to $146,000, have
been filed in the County Court here.
Each of the suits is for $7000. They
were filed by the non-union miners at
Brookwood, sixteen miles north of
Tuscaloosa, against the United Mine
Workers of America, District No. 20
of that organization and the local or
ganization there.
The plaintiffs allege that during the
month of October last the local or
ganization made a demand upon the
Alabama Consolidated Iron and Coal
Company to dismiss from their mines
all non-union workers, declaring that
if the company should fail to grant
their request a strike would result, and
that on account of heavy contracts
which the company was compelled to
fil it was compelled to act as the union
miners demanded. They allege that for
this reason on. November 10 they were
turned out of their homes and many of
them deprived of the bare necessaries
of life.
Last De Paelmiaiin Concert.
The last of the De Pachmann con

new following on this visit, and
gained anew the admiration of those
familiar with his work from former
years.
OREGON HARES
ARE NOT FAST
Prove Artful Dodgers, but
Do Not Possess the Speed
of San Joaquin Fliers
SACfiAMENTO BOY WINS
Old Greyhound Shows That
He Is Still in the Run
ning by Capturing Stake
Although classed as an old-timer as
a courser, Sacramento Boy still pos
sesses enough class to beat some of the
best greyhounds in training. He dem
onstrated this at Ingleside Coursing
Park yesterday, when he defeated In
Time in the deciding course of the
forty-eight-dog reserve stake. He was
fortunate in getting two byes, but at
that the up-country courser proved the
best. In the deciding trial with In
Time, which was running in excellent
form, Sacramento Boy did not let her
score.
The first lot of hares received from
Oregon were given a trial yesterday.
They do not possess the speed shown
by the Merced hares, though they are
clever dodgers and will give a lot of
troubie to poor-working dogs which try
to pick them up. They are short and
squatty and are covered with a thick
coating of dark gray fur.
Lucy Clair ran though the class
stake in the easiest kind of style. The
little black greyhound appears at her
best, and from the manner in which
she defeated Black Coon in the decid
ing course she will be hard to beat in
the future.
It was the poorest day the form play

CLEVER TENNIS
SHOWN BY LONG
After Losing One Set to
3liller He Plays Safely
and Proves Victorious
A brisk north wind dried the tennis
courts in the middle of the afternoon
and the enthusiasts were
able to get in a few practice games.
The courts at Golden Gate Park do not
dry as rapidly as those of the Califor
nia Club, and this fact kept many of
the players from attending. Quite a
number of those remaining In the tour
nament were present, but their i/ppo
nents were absent. The only match
played was that in which Herbert Long
defeated Miller. The latter made- good
use of his handicap and took the first
set. Long played a much safer game
in the next two sets and won easily.
The score was 3-6, 6-2, 6-2.
Only one continuous tournament
match was played in the California
Club courts. The contestants were
third-class men, but the match was ex
tremely close and interesting. W. G.
Knowlton, who recently graduated
from the fourth class, was pitted
against Dr. Lovegrove. Knowlton
started originally in the tenth position
in the fourth class. He beat player
after player in his class and finally
reached the top. Not content with this,
he went after the third class players
and met with the same success until he
reached Dr. Lovegrove. The latter is
No. 3 in the third class, and he had the
distinction yesterday of stopping the
New Brunwick champion's onward
rush.
Although beaten, Knowlton was by
no means disgraced. The doctor's nu
merous serves proved Knowlton's un
doing. He no sooner became used to
one serve than the medical expert
would spring a new one on him. The
first set was close and went to Love
grove by an 8-6 score. Knowlton came
right back at him and took the second
set handily. The third set was the
longest and closest of the three. First
one player was ahead and then the
other, until Lovegrove finally won out
in the eighteenth game. The score was
8-6, 2-6, 10-8. â
' \-, Some .. good practice games were
played, the best of which was a dou
bles between Carl Gardner and George
Janes and Frank Mitchell ; and Sidney
Salisbury Three c-f the four sets played
were ' unusually long. Gardner and
Janes carried off the honors by a small
margin. The score was three sets to

was routed by the Brooklyn Club
football team on the Presidio grounds
yesterday afternoon by a score of 5 to

from head to toe.
The Brooklyns - rallied late >in . the
second half and managed to rush the
ball up, to MJley's .ten-yard ., line. A
few successful bucks were then exe
cuted. and the touchdown was scored
without djflaculty. The soldiers had
things their own way shortly be

MANY RELIEVED
BY COMMITTEE
Work of Benevolence by the
Niii Francisco Odd Fellows
During Term of Six 31ontks
The San Francisco general relief com
mittee of the Independent Order of Odd
Fellows held its one hundred and sixth
semi-annual meeting and election for
officers in the Odd Fellows' building
yesterday, when the following named
â were chosen to serve for the^ current
term: F. J. Smithson, president; C. W.
Clifton, vice president; J. F. Nichols,
secretary (re-elected), and C. R. Hol
ton, treasurer. The election for vice
president was the most exciting one
that has been known in this organiza
tion for many years, there being six
candidates, and it was not until the sec
ond ballot was taken that Mr. Clifton
â was chosen. The officers were duly in
stalled by Leon S. Mayer, the retiring
president, who was presented by the
members of the outgoing board,
through Past President W. I. Brobeck,
with a diamond-set "and emblematic
ring in appreciation of what he had
done for the committee during his term.
In the course of the presentation it was
made to appear that during the latter
portion of the term the funds of the
committee were tied up for a time and
that President Mayer, feeling that
many deserving members would suffer
if payment was delayed until the tech
nicality was removed, advanced the
committee nearly $400 to tide over the
difficulty. All matters were subsequent
ly satisfactorily adjusted, the money
â¢was returned to its proper fund and the
committee, by unanimous vote at yes
terday's meeting and a vote of thanks,
ordered the money repaid to President
.Mayers.
COMMITTEE Bl"SV.
Thr- reports presented showed that the
committee during the last six months
attended to 333 cases, relieving the im
mediate wants of the members of the
order, assisting many in distress and

NEVER WITHOUT THE GOODS. !
A prominent broker of New York, who,!
is called upon to make a number of trips i
to Europe every year, always includes in i
his traveling paraphernalia a case of Red j
Raven. When jested with upon this fact I
by his friends he took the matter <juit<Â±
seriously and said: "While you young
men may take Red Raven before break
fast for too much eating or drinking the i
night before and to get rid of that dark j
brown taste. I have always found the
water an excellent alleviative for sea
sickness, and that feeling of fullness and \
lassitude that so often accompanies long i
journeys. 1 have never among the for- I
<ipn bitter waters found an aperient that i
acts so surely and gently upon the liver,
It being absolutely painless. I, therefore, \
take no chances, and carry Red Raven '
with me wherever I go." â¢
advancing benefits and necessaries to
the sick, In doing which the sum of
$9154 50 was used from the general fund
and $50? from the friendship fund. The
nÂ»pt of running the committee for the
term was $480 85. The receipts were
$11,732 95.
There were present among those who
are no longer active members of the
committe? Past Presidents L. L.. Re
mey. Frank L.. Turpin, W. I. Brobeck,
Frank D. Macbeth, A. M. Brand and
Henry W. Opthoff and Past Treasurer
Louis Kragen.
President .Smithson announced the

A GOOD DINNER.
At the close of the meeting there was
an adjournment to a grotto, where a
delicious installation dinner was par
taken of. Emll Pohli was selected
toastmaster and was an interesting as
well as a very witty one. Those who re
sponded to toasts assigned them were:
W. I. Brobeck, F. J. Smithson, H. W.
Osthoff, C. W. Clifton, Ernest C. Stock,
H. B. Ward, Harry K. Wolff. F. L.
Turpin. Leon S. Mayer, A. M. Brand,
Louis Kragen and H. D. Newhouse.
A pretty after-dinner incident fol
lowed a suggestion by one of the speak
ers, to the effect that in a fraternal as
sociation whenever there has been an
honest expression of opinion in the dis
cussion of business which has a ten
dency to engender a feeling of animos
ity the parties in interest should not
harbor such feeling, but should meet
half-way, explain and extend each oth
er the hand of true good-fellowship.
This suggestion was offered by the
speaker without knowledge that there
had been any such feeling engendered
| lÂ»y two members of the committee, but
after he took his seat Harry K. Wolff
and President Mayer each stated that
there had been such a feeling growing
out of criticisms as to business meth
ods, each acknowledged error and re
gret at having lost his temper and each
said that for a long time neither had
spoken to the other, but each expressed
a willingness to meet the other half
way and shake hands. They did this,
and the act was loudly applauded.

FOOTPADS KEEP
UP THEIR WORK
Frank T. Simmons, Artist.
Is Strangled and Robbed
of a Diamond Scarf Pin
SUSPECT IS ARRESTED
E. G. Hausserman Held Up
on Mission Street and Two
Lose in Golden Gate Park
Footpads roamed the city on Satur- |
day night looking for victims. Frank '
T. Simmons, lan artist living at 923
Folsum street, asserts that he was one
of the victims. He told Sergeant Syl
vester on Saturday night that about
10 o'clock a man who was accompa
nied by a small boy got a strangle hold
on him at Folsom and Falmouth
streets and deftly extracted Simmons'
diamond scarf pin valued at $85. Syl
vester instructed Policeman A. Sulli
van and W. M. Phillips to go with
Simmons in an effort to find the
strangles. In a saloon at Falmouth and
Shipley streets Simmons pointed to
Thomas McCarthy, a janitor living at
240>0 Sixth street, and accused him of
being the man who robbed him. Mc-
Carthy declared his innocence, but was
locked up pending developments.
E. G. Hausserman. 816 Mission street,
says he was also a victim of footpads.
He notified the police on Saturday
night that while he was on his way
home about 9 o'clock two men ap
proached him near Third street and
one asked him for 10 cents. Hausser
nian said he had no money and the
man struck him on the face and
knocked him down. The men went
through his pockets and got $9, all
the money he had. He was able to
give a good description of the two
men.
Walter Planz, 415 Turk street, re
ported to the police yesterday that he
and a companion, David Hughes, were
held up by a tall masked man near
the aviary in Golden Gate Park on
Saturday night, January 28. The man
had a revolver and pointed it at them.
They were ordered to throw up their
hands and they obeyed promptly. The
footpad took $1 10 from Planz and $1
from Hughes and ran away in the di
rection of the tennis court. Planz said
he* did not report the hold-up earlier
because he wanted to avoid notoriety. ;

is supposed to be a burglar in the
guise of a milkman. A suspicious
locking man had been seen hanging
around that neighborhood for two or
three days. He spoke to Mrs. Crow
loy's little niece and wanted her to go
away with him. Miss Lopa Crowley,
Mrs. Crowley's daughter, also saw the
man on Friday evening and he stared
rudely at her as she passed him.
About 2 o'clock yesterday morning
J. H. Burke, who occupies the flat
above Mrs. Crowley, had his attention
attracted by the loud barking of Mrs.
Crowley's dog. He heard a commotion
on the back porch, and stepping out
on his own porch he asked, "Who is
there?" A man's voice replied, "I'm the
milkman, but this dog won't let me
leave."
Burke asked the man to come up
the steps to his fiat and he would al
low him to get away through his front
door. A man came up carrying a
small tin bucket and hurried through
Burkes fiat to the street.
Burke informed Mrs. Crowley yes
terday morning of the experience he
had with her milkman and she said
her milk is delivered afternoons. From
a description given by Burke MiSB
Crowley believes the same man stared
rudely at her on Friday evening. Cap
tain Gleeson was notified, and he was
satisfied that the pretended milkman
had visited Mrs. Crowley's residence
again with the object of robbing it.
He has instructed his men to look out
for the crook.
JAMES MORTON BROWER DIES
AFTER A SHORT ILLNESS
For Years Deceased Was Connected
With The Call and Was
Generally Esteemed.
James Morton Brower, for twenty
four years an employe of The Call,
died in this city last night after a
brief illness. On Thursday he waa
stricken with apoplexy while walking
from dinner in company with his wife.
He was removed to a hospital and
never rallied.
At all times courteous and of gentle
disposition, he won a host of friends
among his co-workers and associates.
He will be greatly missed in the proof
room of The Call, where he worked,
as well as by the many associates to
whom he was especially endeared by
reason of sterling traits.
It was only a week ago that Mr.
Brower acted as pallbearer at the fu
neral of Robert MacMullen, a fellow
newspaper man, and upon leaving the
grave he made the remark: "I won
der who will be the next one to go."
He was born in New York City fifty
eight years ago, and for fifty-two
years had been a resident of San
Francisco. He was a son of the late
Judge J. D. Brower of "Suisun, who
was one* of the founders of the San
Francisco Fire Department. He was I
also a brother of Mrs. C. W. Pendle
ton of Los Angeles and of J. D. Brow
er of Salinas. Mr. Brower leaves a
widow, who resides at 610% Post
street.
The funeral will take place "Wednes
day under the auspices of San Fran
cisco Typographical Union No. 21, of
which organization Mr. Brower was a
member.

SLAVIC DIAL.ECT CAUSES
DONKEY TO BUN AMUCK
Albert Jialcevich Tells Animal to
Whoavich and Is Kicked Over
the Fence.
Because Albert Raicevich, a boy of
14, addressed him in the Slavic dia
lect yesterday one of the donkeys in
Golden Gate Park ran amuck. He
butted Albert over the fence that sur
rounds the donkey speed track and
wrecked a goat-cart. Young Raice
vich received some severe bruises in
the tumble and had to be treated at
the Park Hospital by Dr. Glover.
When the boy mounted the animal
and ordered him to "getupski" the
long-eared animal seemed suspicious
and began to cavort. "Whoavich!"
shouted Albert. That settled it. The
donkey t>ranced over to the fence and
Albert went over like a bolt from a
catapult. The animal that objected to
the dialect was christened Maudde
vich on the spot by the donkey-boys.

BARBERS VOTE
AGAINST BILL
Oppose Placing Themselves
Under Proposed Law Now
Before the Legislature
CALISH WORKS FOR ACT
Lively Meeting at Which the
Tonsorialists Skillfully
Dissect the Word "Graft
Barberdom of San Francisco was well
represented yesterday afternoon at a
mass-meeting: held at 32 O'Farrell
street. Master barbers and journey
men barbers, with the union and pro
tective organizations, were represented.
Senate bill No. 346, to regulate the busi
ness and the sanitary conditions of bar
ber shops in the State, was opposed,
those voting in favor of it being 33 and
against it 59.
J. J. Calish, a member of the dis- '
solved commission which had to do
with the barbers' trade, warmly fa- i
vored the bill in the early stage of the
debate, but it was evident that he
failed to win a substantial following.
Section one sets forth that it shall be
unlawful for any person not at the
time of the passage of the act in prac- !
tice as a barber to begin such practice â 
unless he or she shall have obtained a *
certificate. Frank J. Harlow, a jour- J
neyman barber from Seattle and Mln- \
neapolis, gave his experience of obtain- i
ing a certificate in those cities. The ;
matter of procuring such authority had
named to him a mere bagatelle, though
a slightly costly procedure. He charged ;
"graft."
It was a lively meeting, and the word
"graft" was freely dissected and the
practice shown to be somewhat preva
lent. One young journeyman barber
told of his giving $1 and obtaining the
privilege of barbering even without
passing an examination. In spite of the
determination of E. P. Roche, the
chairman, that there should be no per
sonalities, they flew about like snow
flakes lrf' a blizzard.
John L. Franklin, president of the lo
cal Barbers' Union; George K. Smith,
State organizer of the California State
Federation of Labor and president of
the Barbers' Union of Oakland, and
others representing the journeymen
spoke on the subject of the bill. Paul
Hammam, ex-president of the local un
ion, expressed fear that if the bill did
not pass they would be confronted with
some of the conditions that he said pre
vailed in Louisville, St. Louis and Chi
cago, where shaves could be had for 5
cents.
Ex-Commissioner Calish insisted that
the bill would be a blow to barber col
leges. The students to-day, he said,
were on the ground floor and shaving
7000 of San Francisco's citizens a week.
Harris Bernard, president of the Mas
ter Barbers' Association, characterized
the "traveling expenses" of a commis
sion as "graft," while another speaker
had little reliance in a commission that
could if it liked mulct a master barber
in heavy expenses by closing up his
place without having justly inquired
into or weighed conditions.
Another speaker told of the already
existing power of the Board of Health,
which can go into any barber shop and
see to its being conducted in a proper
sanitary manner.
One gentleman asked whether they
could sterilize a barber before he went
to work, or a customer when he en
tered a shop. The answer failed to
come.
Calish, after the bill failed to receive
the support of the meeting, wished to
have the matter reconsidered and to
adjourn for a week, but neither of his
propositions carried.

IS MATRIMONY
ALL FAILURE?
Prospective Eligible for
Marriage Gets an Inside
View of Wedded Home Life
"He cured others, himself he cannot
cure," might be twisted into "She mar
ried others; herself she could not mar
ryâwell," a phrase which may get to
be as popular as the former if proprie
tresses of marriage bureaus become en
tangled in domestic unpleasantness, as
did Mrs. Viola Hass, a matrimonial
artist at 1167 Howard street. Mrs. Hass
is still doing business at the same
stand, but her better half reclines on a
couch at the City Prison and a charge
of threats to kill is registered against
him.
Edward Hass, the husband, an uphol
sterer, last evening seized a butcher
knife and intimated that with one blow
he would sever the Jugular vein of his
wife and decapitate her two children.
The family was at the dinner table.
Mrs. Hass had a client, a prospective
"eligible," as guest. She thought to
show him a little of married life, so
that he could get into the spirit and
perform the usual loving husbandly
duties when he took unto himself a
wife. Mrs. Hass said she had "Just the
woman for him." "It will be an excel
lent match. Stay to dinner with us and
see what connubial bliss is," spoke the
fair matchmaker. The man, a real es
tate dealer, whose name the police are
withholding, stayed to dinner. To his
staying qualities Mrs. Hass probably
owes her life.
In the midst of the meal Hass was
seized with a demon and arose, raving
about money matters and taunting
Mrs. Hass on a tender family topic. He
clutched a huge butcher knife in his
hand, and flourishing it reached across
the family board to smite his better
half. Mrs. Hass dodged and dealt her
husband a blow that staggered him.
while the guest seized the violent man
until Policemen Farrell and Conlon, at
tracted by the noise, arrived and locked
up the hostile upholsterer. In the shuf
fle the prospective bridegroom made
his escape and was seen rushing down
Howard street muttering, "Not for me
is any of this marriage business!"
The Hass home life has not been the
life that Â»as daily depicted in happy
adjectives by Mrs. Hass to her clinen
tele. Her children, one by a former
husband and an adopted child, were
the butt of Hass' brutality, and daily
differences occurred until the hostilities
almost resulted in murder last night.
Accidentally Asphyxiated.
A young man named Max Peters
was found in an unconscious condition
in his room at 218 Shotwell street yes
terday morning.' suffering from as
phyxiation, caused by gas escaping
frcm an open jet. He was removed to
the City and County Hospital for treat
ment. The gas jet is believed to have
been left open accidentally. Peters'
chances of recovery are said to be
doubtful.
Says He Was Robbed.
Harry Huntley, who rooms at the
Empire Hotel on Folsom street, de
clares he was held up by a gang of
rowdies on Seventh street, near Mar
ket, on Saturday night and robbed of
J5 and papers in his pocket. He says
the robbers followed him out of a
saloon. Captain Spillane will investi
gate the case.
