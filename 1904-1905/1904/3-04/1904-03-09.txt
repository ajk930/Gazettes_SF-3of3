millionaire, lost his life this afternoon
while rescuing: a young: girl from
drowning.
* Smith was a passenger on the

at a dock a few miles below Portland.
The passengers were thrown into a
commotion by the shout from a spec

"There's a young girl fallen over
board and I can't swim."
"I can," shouted Smith, who was a
ueU-known athlete, and he rushed to
the rail and leaped overboard to the
rescue of Oza Brown, a 12-year-old
girl, who had slipped upon the upper
deck and fallen under the rail into the
Willamette River.
Smith ewam to where the young
girl was struggling, and with one arm
lifted her head above water, swim
ming with the other. The deck hands
hurriedly" lowered a boat.
Rowing to within a few feet of the
two, they saw Smith suddenly sink,
having been seized with a cramp or
sucked under by a strong eddy. The
girl was drawn into the boat, but
gmith never rose to the surface. The
body has not been recovered.
Smith was a member of a famous

The steamer Dover and the barge
Illinois were moored at the landing

drift that had accumulated around the
center pier. The boat was tied above
the bridge by a long cable. In this
way the steamer and barge were let
down i near the bridge. . A line was
made fast to the drift and the boat
started forward, expecting to pull the
drift loose.
Everything was progressing nicely
when suddenly the cable parted and
before the steamer and barge could be
got under control they smashed
broadside Into the bridge, causing the
same to topple overi A portion of the
draw hit the steamer and caused her to
dip and she took a quantity of water,
but after going down stream several
hundred yards the boats were secured
to the shore and the pumps set to work
and soon had her pumped out. '
At the time of the accident there
were perhaps twenty-five or i thirty
women and men standing on the draw
and when the boat hit and the big
structure commenced to tremble, then
began at first. to topple over, there was

Lyman told the story of the effort
on the part of Prophet Joseph Smith
to get rid of one of the high council
ors who had been chosen by revela
tion and the refusal of the people
to submit to the change. This was for
the purpose of showing that the will
of the people is stronger thart the wish
or command of the president of the
church. '
"Do you mean to say," asked Sena
tor Hoar, "that a revelation from the
Lord which had been rejected by the
people would count for nothing?"
. "It would, count for nothing for
those who rejected it."
"Would it be binding upon the in
strument of the Lord who received the
revelation? I. mean if the revelation
should be received by you and the
people refused it; would it be binding
upon you to follow the revelation or
to follow the wish of the people?"
"We should follow the "wish of the
people." >,'/Â¦",- J
"Well, how about you ?"
"I; should be bound by what the peo
ple direct,"
â¢â¢ "Then," said Senator Hoar, "the voice
of the people is of more authority than
the mandate of the Lord?"
"The law, of the Lord is whatever i3
done by common consent.*
"."Then the Lord submits to the people
.whatever he desires to have done, and
if the people like it they give their con-
Bent. That is your, belief, is it?" .
Chairman Burrows asked Lyman in
regard to the Reorganized Church of
Latter- Day Saints at Lamonia, Iowa,
of which a son of Joseph Smith, the
prophet, is the head, and Lyman gave
his ideas 6f the differences between the
two organizations. He was asked if
the reorganized church did, not 1 - de
nounce polygamy, and answered:
"They denounce it so hard that it al
most provokes us to defend it."
Senator Dubois asked if the reorgan
ized church teaches absolute obedience
to its leaders, and was informed by
Lyman that he understood the church
was not very strenuous in that regard.
"Now, in regard to consent given
Senator Smoot to become a candidate
for Senator â suppose President Smith
had refused to give this consent and
Smoot had insisted on becoming a can
didate, what would have happened to
him?" asked Senator Dubois.
Lyman said Smoot would have been
disciplined, taken to task, reproved or
corrected. |
Tayler here said it had been shown
one of the religions was composed of
peaceable, law-abiding citizens, while
the other is a menace to society and
good government and that "in the lat-'

asked. .

said to be the law of God, and con

. "They would' not denounce It," said
Lyman. He said that was the situa

In answer to a question by Senator
Overman, Lyman said that despite the

church could issue authority upon an
elder to perform plural marriages.
"The president holds the keys," said
Lyman.
"What do you mean?"
"That lie is the only one who has any
authority."
Lyman said missionaries always are
thoroughly warned not to discuss po

"If I am thought worthy I will suc

church, if I survive President Smith,";
said Lyman in answer to a question.
Lyman said that he is the "presiding
official of the twelve apostles. The
name of John Henry' Smith, a polyga-1
mist, was given as' the second member"
of the twelve : apostles, and that"', of
George Teasdale, a polygamist, as the
third apostle; HeberJ. Grant, a polyga
mist, fourth; John W. Taylor, a polyga
mist, fifth ; Mr. Merrill, a polygamist, 1
sixth, making * five Â¦ apostles who are
conceded to be polygamists.
"Senator Smoot has attended the
meetings of the apostles," said Lyman,'
"and has taken, part Â¦. in the exercises
at the weekly meetings." - The .witness
said he had never : introduced , any of
his wives to Mr: Smoot.
Chairman Burrows asked. of. the na
ture of the marriage service known as
WILL SUCCEED SMITH.
"I want," he said after a short' pause
and dropping into a pleasing voice, "to
make a brief explanation if you will
permit. My case is different from that
of most other men. 'I was;born in 1840,
and I can hardly remember when my
father was not a polygamist. He was; a
friend and adviser of Prophet Joseph
Smith, and was taught by him the im
portance and the truth of the principles
of polygamy. He accepted the teach
ing and entered into the practice, mar
rying six wives in the years 1845 and
1846, so th.\l my earliest recollection
embraces the life of polygamy. I re
member all my father's wives as I do
roy own mother, and I lived in a fam
ily thus constituted until I grew up and
became the head of a family of. my
own. Consequently I have known notli
ing else, ' and I have felt that it was
correct. I-have always.felt.in my heart
and my soul that I was correct. I mar
ried flrst in 1857,. again in 1869 and once
more in < 1884. â¢â¢Trie situation has been
very painful to me, and I have been
greatly pained to find myself in opposi
tion to the law of the country and of
the church. But I have made a coye-|
nant with my wives to love, respect and
endear them, and I could not find it in
my heart ,to separate from them so
long as they were true to me."
Senator Hoarâ So you, an apostle of
your church, expecting to succeed Mr.;
Smith in the presidency and in that
capacity to receive divine revelations
yourself, confess that you are now liv-j
ing and expect to continue to-live in
disobedience to the laws of the country/
the law of your. church. and the law of
God?
The witness replied with ,a simple,
"Yes."" . â¢ . ..";â¢ â¢ Â¦ :â¢ .;
: "Referring to' the rule of which you
have spoken,"' Hoar said, "you under
stand the rule or the law of the church
to be the law of God, did you not?" J Â¦
Lyman replied that such was his un
derstanding, r
"Then you are living and intend to
live inÂ» violation of the law of God and
man?"
, "I fully intend," said Lyman, show
ing a disposition to elaborate more than
he had done, "to be true to the law of
my country, to my God and to my obli
gations and covenants with my wives,
and I have never done a thing that my
conscience did not approve."
EXPLAIN o POSITION".
This was not answered directly at.
the time. â¢ Several questions by mem
bers of the committee followed In rapid
succession, and Lyman admitted,, in
response to thÂ« m Â» that he knew that
in.liyitijg"in polygamy he was disobey
ing '60th the law of the land and the
rule of his church. Â¦ He also said - in
reply to one of these questions that he
was not only now living in polygamV
qua cohabitation, _but that he expected
to continue po to 'live, . .-... - . ;
Senator Hoar at last took the wit
ness in hand and brought, out a suc
cinct statement from ;him which was of
a character to Interest all present.
In regard to his father's ] family
Merrill said he had. a father. with six
wives *and that he had twenty brothers
and seventeen sisters. He was asked
how many nephews and nieces he had
and said he did not know, but thought
there were more. than 100.
Francis Lyman, a member of the
first presidency of the Mormon church
and the prospective successor :of
President Joseph Smith, was <the next
witness. He was born sixty-four years
ago and became an apostle in 1880.
"Are you a polygamist?" Mr. Tay
ler asked, and the witness
frankly. "Y.es." He said that he had
had three wives and that of .them two
are still living. By his second wife,
to whom he was married in 1884, he
had five children, the last being born
in 190.0. Lyman said that he h;id been
one of the. signers of the prayer for
amnesty, pledging himself to all that
it' contained. He did not, however, re
call Just what it did contain.
Tayler read portions of the prayer.
"Did you," he asked, "interpret that
to mean that you would abstain from
polygamous cohabitation?"
"I interpreted it to mean that I
should do all that was right."
, "Did you think it would be right to
abstain from polygamous cohabita
tion?" . r
KNOWINGLY BREAKS LAW.
A LARGE FAMILY.
"Well, tell us about that," several
members qf the committee demanded.
"I cannot, repeat it," said the wit
ness. . â¢ v
, "Do you mean to say that you do
not know the ordinary marriage cere
mony of the church?" asked Senator
Hoar severely.
''Yes, I know that," answered the
witness. â¢ '-Â¦;;*
"And was : not that what was
asked?" he was dsked.
The witness said it was. He was
told to give the substance of it. He
said he and his wife stood up and
joined hands. . . â¢
"Then they made you promise some
thing:, did they not?" inquired Senator
Hoar.
"Yes, sir."
"But you have forgotten what it
'was?" the Senator remarked, with a
laugh. . ,
"Oh, no, I have, not forgotten," said
Merrill. He then said "that he had
promised to love", cherish and support
the woman. . â¢ Â¦ . â¢

considerable controversy. The guns

LONDON, March 8.â Two most inter
esting questions were answered by Pre
mier Balfour in to-day's Parliamentary
papers, giving replies to questions. The
first referred to fiscal matters, and Mr.
Balfour said:
'The declared policy > of his Majesty's
Government does not include the taxa
tion of food, and it is "not proposed to
deal with the fiscal question during the
current Parliament."
The second answer raised the wide,
question of the use of neutral ports by
belligerents.- John L. Wilson (Liberal),
who asked the question, referred to the
use which Russian warships recently
made and are still making of the ports
of Candia, Suez and Port Said, and!
suggested the desirability of communi
cating to the neutral powers possessing
seaboard or trade routes between Great j
Britain and the East, particularly the ;
Mediterranean and the Red Sea, the i
views of the British Government as to
the duties of neutrals in regard to the j
treatment of warships of belligerents
seeking to use neutral ports in connec- 1
tion with operations of ships of neutral i
powers. ' i
Mr. Balfour, while not explaining the
Government's attitude, admitted Â« that
the points raised were of the greatest
international importance, and said they
were receiving the attention of the
Government.

sided.
The appointment of Dr. Rjcnard
Henebry to be instructor in Celtic phil
ology was announced by President
Wheeler and confirmed by the board.
The compensation allowed is $1000 per
annum, that amount having been set
aside at a former meeting of the Re
gents. t
The president reported that Dr. Hene
bry received his degree of Ph. D. from
the University of Greifswald, where he
was a student under Professor *55im
mer, one of th'e most distinguished
Celtic scholars In Europe. He has also
studied with Professor Strachan of
Owen's College, Manchester, England,
and with Professor Thurneysen
of. Freiberg in Germany. He was
brought to the president's at
tention by Professor Strachan,
who has been associated most promi
nently with the scholarly side of the
Celtic revival in Great Britain. Pro
fessor Strachan was a fellow student
with President Wheeler In Germany
years ago. Dr. Henebry until quite re
cently was professor of Celtic philology
in the University of Washington, D. C.
and has more recently been engaged in
lecturing in Ireland and England. The
central interest of his studies lies in the
modern Irish literature, but he has
studied middle Irish and old Irish, and
he will be able to give courses in the
comparative philology of the Celtic lan
guages and in the earlier types of tho
Celtic literatures.
President Wheeler made further an
nouncements as follows:
On March 1 there was received from
D. O. Mills a further contribution of
$4000 toward the expenses of the Mills
expedition to South America.
Mrs. Hearst has presented $600 for a
portion of the salary of the profesor
ship of pathology for the remainder of
the current fiscal year. This ls in con
tinuation of a similar gift at cur
rent Intervals for some years past.
M. Braverman of Vlsalia has- present
ed to the university a collection of sev
en medals, some valuable mineralogical
specimens, and to the botanlqal mu
seum some specimens of cork wood
grown in Visalia. '

replied that if the Russia/i Minister
would withdraw in a peaceful man
ner, taking with him his staff and le
gation guard, he would be fully pro
tected by Japanese troops. -. He did
so withdraw of his own free will on
the 20th of February, and an escort of
Japanese soldiers was furnished him
as far as Chemulpo. In this connec
tion it may be remarked that the Rus
sian Consul at Eusan remained at his
post as late as February 28.- It is re
ported : that he was . compelled to stay
that long in the absence of , instruc
tions, which the Russian Minister; ap
parently did not care to give him. be

SHANGHAI. March 8.â The rigid
censorship placed by the Japanese
authorities on all telegraphic dis
patches, both press and private, has
caused many of. the foreign corre
spondents to seek a field of news on the
mainland. Correspondents who have
reached here from Tokio report that
the censorship is more perfect than
they have ever encountered, and is ex
ercised on inter-communlcation as well
as on foreign matter. Traffic on the
wires has trebled and their original
carrying capacity is reduced because
the War Department and the Foreign
Office each has taken possession of
the many trunk lines that run south
through the empire. The exactions of
the censorships and the difficulties of
inter-communlcatlon have served to
largely obscure the view of the corre
spondents and probably have resulted
in much conflicting news from various
points. It is expected that when the
corps of newspaper correspondents
who are now. In Toklo are finally al
lowed to go to the front, a serious con
dition of telegraphic service will re
sult, as the land lines are not adequate
to the traffic they will be called upon
to carry. . .
The regulations- for the government
of foreign newspaper correspondents
have been promulgated and are iron
clad. One article provides that if a
war correspondent violate* the crimi
nal laws, the military criminal laws or
the law for the preservation of military
secrets, 'he may be punished according
to military law by court-martial.

WASHINGTON. March 8. â Postmaster Gen
eral Payna baa been detained at home for mr
eral days by a severe attack of stout. Secre
tary Wilson Is confined to his homi with rrtp.
Austria and Italy are not moving at
Constantinople, where all . the powers
therefore, except Russia and Great
Britain, are quiescent.
Russia would not use the Dardanelles
now if she could, in the opinion of ex
perts here, because her Black Sea fleet
is not ready for a Far Eastern cam
paign, and if it were ready Russia
would wait until her Baltic fleet was
thoroughly equipped. It Is believed that
Russia could not hope for a decisive
naval success without the Baltic, Black
Sea and' Mediterranean .squadrons
uniting and proceeding east together,
as- otherwise they would be destroyed
piecemeal.-*
BERLIN, March 8.â The Porte has
thus far met the requests of the Rus
sian Embassador to Turkey, Zlnovieff,
to permit the Black Sea fleet to pass
the DaiCanelles by naming conditiona
wholly unacceptable to Russia. One of
these conditions, naturally, is that Rus
sia shall break off or evade the fulfill
ment of her agreement with Austria
respecting the Balkans, give the Sultan
leave to settle the controversy by his
own methods and that Russia shall as
sist Turkey should Austria, or other
powers dispute the Sultan's decision.
Russia rejected these proposals as pre
posterous, but she renewed her request,
to which there seems little likelihood
of the Sultan yielding, as British diplo
macy is active in Constantinople in
urging upon the Porje a strict observ
ance of the Berlin treaty. France, so
far as can be perceived here, has not
seconded Russia in this matter.
Such a step as permitting the Black
Sea fleet to pass the Dardanelles would
be regarded diplomatically as a breach
of neutrality on the part of Turkey,
though Great Britain's opposition to it,
being aimed at the maintenance of the
status quo, is not so considered. Rus
sia's diplomatic weight in Constantino
ple has been somewhat reduced by the
occurrences In the Far East. The Pocte
will give nothing without a heavy price.
Germany expresses no opinion on the
subject. The most that Germany would
do in. the event of a bargain between
Russia and Turkev for the release of
the Black Sea fleet would be to main
tain silence, neither advising nor as
sisting either party. The Government
here Is looking ahead. It can conceive
of a time when It will be to Germany's
advantage to have a portion of the
Russian navy locked up.
"According to reports of the events
of March 7 the enemy's squadron reap
peared at 8 o'clock in the morning near
Vladivostok. They entered Ussuri Bay
and proceeded along the coast without
opening fire. The, squadron then re
turned and headed for Cape- Gamova
(Posslet Bay), which it reached at 3:40
p. m. The enemy finally turned off
when opposite Pallas Bay and departed
in a southerly direction." <.
"Upon arriving off Mount St. Joseph
and the Ussuri Bay battery the squad
ron, preserving the same ortfer, made
toward the- battery. The ships opened
fire from both sides, evidently first
using blank cartridges in order to warm
their guns. At" 1:45 p. m., when at a
distance of eight versts from the shore,
the leading ship opened fire with her
forward guns, and then the entire
squadron steamed along the shore, fir-
Ing their port guns as they went. The
enemy did not fire while turning. After
the third turn the . squadron, at 2:25
p. m., ceased firing and steamed off to
the southward, about ten miles to the
right of Askold Island, finally disap
pearing at 5:30 p. m.'
"In all the enemy fired about 200
shots, with no effect. No damage was
done to the fortress or the entrench
ments, and in the town and at other
parts of the fortifications the damage
was insignificant.
"The garrison is in excellent spirits,
and the operations of preparing the
batteries for action were carried out in
perfect order.
ST. PETERSBURG. March 8.âVice
roy Alexieff has sent the Czar the fol
lowing telegram:
"MUKDEN. March 8.â I have the
honor to communicate to your Majesty
the following details of the events of
March 6: The enemy's squadron ap
proached Vladivostok toward 11 o'clock
in the morning, having passed near
Askold Island. After several maneu
vers, which involved changes in' the
squadron's order of battle, two' cruisers
were left to the north of the island and
the remaining vessels of the squadron
steamed along the coast of Ussuri Bay
parallel to the shore, keeping about fif
teen versts (approximately ten miles)
therefrom.
'LONDON, March 9.â The Far East
ern news published here continues to
be most meager. The dispatch of Vice
roy Alexieff adds practically nothing to
the accounts of the Vladivostok bom
bardment, contained in the dispatches
of Monday. There is no confirmation
of the rumor that the Russian Vladivo
stok squadron has been engaged and
the Tokio correspondent of the Daily
Telegraph, cabling on the night of
Tuesday, March 8, says:
"No details have : yet been received
of the fight at Vladivostok."
The whereabouts of the Vladivostok
squadron is still unknown, and it would
appear to be quite unlikely that a na
val battle has occurred.
The sending of Marquis Ito on a
mission to Korea is regarded here as
the most significant news of the day,
and is believed to indicate a virtual
protectorate over Korea, which will be
come the Japanese military base and
source of supplies. Marquis Ito enjoys
great prestige. He visited the Emperor
of Korea in- 1898 and since then he had
been held in the highest esteem by the
Emperor, who often consulted with
him.
It is reported from Shanghai that
Viceroy Alexieff is preparing to remove
his headquarters to Harbin, after hav
ing in vain ordered the Tartar general
to dismiss the Chinese garrison â¢ at
Mukden.
In Shanghai it is believed that the
Japanese will attempt the seizure of
Newchwang as soon as the Ice clears.
The Chefu correspondent of the>Daily
Express reports that a large Japanese
fleet has been seen proceeding in the
direction of Newchwang.
Among other unconfirmed reports, it
is said at Yinkow that the- Japanese
have advanced to Fenghoancheng,
about forty mileB northwest of Wiju.
Any persons, therefore, desiring to
assist this worthy cause, may leave
their contributions with Mr. H- Yoshi
oka. secretary of this society, at 420

duly acknowledged and forwarded.

The forthcoming visit of- Marquis Ito
as a special Embassador from the Em
peror c-f Japan to the Emperor of Ko
rea claims general attention. It was
originally planned to send a promi
nent Japanese to Seoul as a permanent
resident, adviser to the Korean Gov
ernment, and various names were sug
gested. The announcement that the
Marquis Ito is going is a surprise. In
official circles it is insisted that the
object of Marquis Ito's visit to Korea
is not politically important.
It is denied that Jaran has any
new plan to execute. It is thought,
however, that Marquis Ito will make
an investigation of the general condi
tion of Korea and formulate possibly
some recommendations which will be
useful In the adoption of a policy for
the future.
TOKIO. March 8.â The Japanep* Go-v
err.mont is considering the advisability
of FeÂ«kins to secure immediately a loan
in America and Europe- Although it
is estimated that enough bonds can be
told at home to provide sufficient
money to prosecute the war for at least
a year and a half. and. although many
Japanese statesmen and financiers be
lieve that Japan is capable of waging
war to a conclusion without borrow
ing a single cent abroad, and have. In
a spirit of national pride, counseled
that no foreign loan be sought, yet it
is felt that there may arise in a year
or two a contingency when money may
be seriously needed. It is believed that
it would be better to place a loan now,
if possible, rather than attempt to do
6O in a future crisis, when money may
be badly needed.
WASHINGTON, March 8.â The Jap
anese Minister Is authorized by his Gov
ernment to give to the press the fol
lowing statement, received on the 4th
insL:
"The Imperial Japanese Government
is given to understand that the Rus
sian Government has recently address
ed a note to the powers In which
the Government of Japan is charged
with having committed certain acts in
Korea which are considered by Russia
to be in violation of international law
and all future orders and. declarations
by the Korean Government are de
clared on that account to be invalid. The
Imperial Government does net find it
necessary in the present Instance to
concern Itself In any way with the
views, opinions or declarations of the
Imperial Russian Government, but
it believes it to be its right and duty
to correct misstatement of fact which,
If permitted to remain uncontradicted,
might give rise to incorrect inferences
and conclusions on the part of the neu
tral powers. Accordingly the Govern
ment of Japan makes the following
statement respecting the five acts
which in the note referred to are de
clared to be fully proved and con
firmed:
"1. It is charged under this head
ing that 'before the opening of hostili
ties against Russia Japan landed troops
in the empire of Korea, which had
declared its neutrality.' The Imperial
Government admits that Japanese
troops landed In Korea before the dec
laration of war was issued, but not
before a state of war actually existed
between Japan and Russia. The main
tenance of the independence and ter
ritorial integrity of Korea is one of
the objects of the war and the dis
patch of troops to the menaced terri
tory was a matter of right and neces
sity, which had the consent of the Ko
rean Government. The Imperial Gov
ernment drew a sharp distinction be
tween the landing of Japanese troops
in Korea under the actual circum
stances of the case with the sending
of aSarge body of Russian troops to
Manchuria without the consent of
China, as was done by Russia, while
peaceful negotiations were still In pro
gress.
"2. Under this heading it is alleged
that Japan 'with a division of the Japa
nese fleet made a sudden attack on the
Sth inst. â that is, three days before the
declaration of warâ on two Russian
warships which were in the neutral
port of Chemulpo and whose command
ers had not been notified of the rupture
of relations, as the Japanese malicious
ly stopped the delivery of Russian tele
grams by the Danish cable and de
stroyed the Korean Government's tele
graphic communication. The Imperial
Government declares that the allega
tions under this heading are untrue.
The Imperial Government did not stop
the delivery of Russian telegrams by
the Danish cable, neither -did they de-
Btroy the Korean Government's tele
graphic communication. Regarding the
alleged sudden attack on the 8th of
.February on two Russian men-of-war
in the port of Chemulpo, it is only
necessary to say that a state of war
existed and that,* Korea having given
her consent to the landing of Japanese
troops at Chemulpo, the harbor of Che
mulpo" thereby ceases to be neutral, at
least as between the belligerents.
"3. It is charged under this heading
that 'in spite of existing international
laws, shortly before the opening of hos
tilities Japan captured as prizes of war
the Russian merchantmen which were
in the neutral ports of Korea.' The Im
perial Government has established the
prize court, with full authority to pro
nounce finally on the question of the
legality of the seizures of merchant
vessels. Accordingly it would be mani
festly out of place for the Imperial Gov
ernment to make any statement re
garding the assertion under this head
ing. .
"4. It is asserted under this number
that Japan declared to the Emperor of
Korea, through the Japanese. Minister
at Seoul, that Korea would be hence
forth under Japanese administration,
and warned his Majesty that in the
case of non-compliance Japanese troops
would occupy the palace. The Imperial
Government declares the charge under
this number to be absolutely and wholly
without foundation In fact.
"5. Under this heading it Is charg
ed that the Japanese Government
'forwarded a summons, through the
French Minister, to the Russian rep
resentative at the court of the Em
peror of Korea to leave the country
with the staff of the Russian legation
and consulate.' -The Imperial Gov
ernment denies" the accuracy of "this
statement No demand, direct or In
direct, was addressed by the Japan
ese Government asking the Russian
Minister to retire from , Korea. The
French Charge d* Affaires, called on
the Japanese Minister- at Seoul and in
formed him verbally, as he did after
ward in writing, that it was the de
sire of the Russian Minister to leave
Korea and asked the opinion of the
Japanese Minister with reference to
the matter. The Japanese Minister
The correspondent repeats the state
ment that the Russian force Intends to
leave Port Arthur to save itself.
Commenting editorially on the Far
Eastern conflict, the Times says: ,
"The situation doubtless is continuing
to develop as rapidly as the season,
considerations of prudence and the de
lays inseparable from movements of
troops on a great scale in countries
where there are few practicable roads
will permit. We know that three di
visions have been landed at Chemulpo
and other troops have been conveyed
to other Korean ports, but there is
reason to believe the main body of th>i
Japanese army has not yet crossed the
sea. A large number of transports,
with room, it is estimated", " for 300.000
men are gathered in Japanese porta,
with many attendant colliers.
"Should the three divisions which
have crossed the sea have reserves
mobilized already this would make a
force available- for action not greatly
ehort of 170,000 men. But this figure
by no means represents the strength cf
the army Japan can put into the field
on the continent of Asia. At a few
days' notice she can mobilize as large
a number again and have them ready
to embark in five or six days after the
issue of the necessary command.
Â» "The destination of this force is a
secret of the Japanese strategists, as
is the moment when it will be dis
patched to deliver its blow."
LONDON. March 8.â A dispatch to
the Morning Post from Shanghai says
the | Japanese mobilization is proceed
ing' methodically and without undus
haste. Everything points to the- main
force being landed somewhere between
Port Arthur and the mouth of the Yalu
River.
A second expedition is being sent to
Newchwang. The Russians are not
preparing to hold Newchwang. which
probably will be occupied by thÂ« Jap
anese. It is therefore probable that
the Russians will withdraw from tha
Yalu and concentrate at a position mora
suited for meeting an attack.

The branch of the Russo-Chinese Bank
at Newchwang has been closed,- while
the Russians there are preparing to
evacuate the place. Two thousand
two hundred additional infantry hav9
been sent to Mukden, while many
small detachments of infantry and
cavalry are being scattered throughout
West I.,iaotunK Peninsula. Paul Les
sar, the Russian Minister at Peking, is
pressing upon the/Chinese Government
a demand that the whole of Manchuria
be thrown open for the operations of
troops durinsr the war.
Matters have become very serious in
Vladivostok in regard to provisions.
Fresh meat from Xikolsk Is no longer
obtainable.- There is" still, however, a
supply of flour, consisting of 13,500
sacks.
On March 2 a number of soldiers
were sent to the neighboring islands
of Popoff, Askold and Putjatin to
shoot deer for food. Crowds awaited
their return on the beach. When they
came back with the spoil the carcasses
were torn to pieces on the spot. Only
a few civilians secured fragmcr** of
the meat.
The Japanese have received full re
ports concerning the Russian prepara
tions for defense against a Japanese
advance in Manchuria. Extensive
earthworks are being rapidly thrown
up from a point nine miles south of
Haicheng, on the line from New
chwang. to Liaoyang and there shortly
will be an unbroken line of earthworks
from Kaiping to Liaoyang. Seven
thousand natives, who have been com
fnandeered by the Russian military au
thorities, are being made to work night
and day under the supervision of Rus
sian officers.
SHANGHAI, March 8.â An engage
ment between Japanese and Russian
troops occurred on the coast about 100
miles from Vladivostok. The Russians
fled, abandoning their arms and stores.
Such is the report that reaches here
from Osaki, Japan. There Is probably
a connection between this report and
a similar one given out from mission

Report 1111 Russian Mil
itary Operations in
Manchuria.
As gathered from the fragments of dispatches that are permitted to pass the military censors in the
Far East this is the present situation in the theater of war: Japan's naval 'operations appear to be cen
tered In an attempt'*to destroy the Russian Vladivostok squadron, (if this "has not already been done, as
claimed in Tokio), while at Ihe same time keeping the Czar's Port Arthur fleet "bottled up*' in the L.iao
tung harbor. The cutting off of the Vladivostok squadron' from its home port was the result of clever
strategy on the part of the Toklo tacticians, who deceived the enemy into the belief that all of the Japan
ese ships were operating off the western coast of Korea. Considering himself in no danger, the Russian
commander put out of the Siberian harbor for his second cruise along the coast of Japan in search of prizes.
While one Japanese squadron, by making a wide detour, got between the Russian ships and their home port,
another is said to be hurrying northward to either destroy them or drive them Into the first squadron,
which Is waiting at the entrance of Ussuri Bay, near Vladivostok. 'Thu?i hemmed In by two numerically,
stronjjcr squadrons, the Russian ships seem doomed to destruction. The four cruisers of the Vladivostok
squadron â the Rossiay, the Gromoboi. the Rurik and the Bogatyr â are among the finest In the Cznr's navy
and their lo*s would be an irreparable disaster. The Japanese warships now off Vladivostok are believed
to be those under the command of Rear Admiral Urhi, which destroyed the Russian cruiser Variag and
the gunboat KoreiU at Chemulpo at the outbreak of the war.
Japan's preparation* for the land campaign are nearly completed. All of the troops sent to the
western coast of Korea have debarked and the first division has reached Pingyang. â¢ The others are ad
vancing as rapidly as bad roads and inclement weather conditions will permit. Meanwhile the landing of
troops on the Kastern Korean coast Is continuing and these are preceding westward, through almost
impenetrable mountain defiles, to effect a juncture with the western army at Pingyang. The two forces
are believed to aggregate in the neighborhood of 120,000 men. When all shall have reached the rendezvous
at Pingyang the general advance "will be ordered. Tokio advices state that the combined forces are ex
l>ected to arrive at the Yalu River by March 16.
- Northwestern Korea is overrun by Cossacks, who have been busying themselves with the destruction
of. bridges and telegraph lines to obstruct the Japanese advance. However, the Russians have shown no
disposition to make a stand, their outposts failing back steadily before the Japanese advance. All of the
heavy fortifying by the Russians I* being done on the west bank of the Yoln and it is probable that the
river will mark the line of serious resistance to the Japanese. The Russian army intrenched on the Yalu
numbers probably 80,000 men.
Of the land operations in other directions much is left to conjecture. The debarking of Japanese troops
south of Xrwcliwans. with the intention of capturing: that town and advancing southward on Lino tang Peninsula
for a land Investment of Port Arthur, has been reported from various sources, and probably with truth.
The Japanese force that landed at Pos.Â«iet Hay. far up on the eastern coast of Korea, Was' only a Â«*nall one, and
Its object is yet in doubt. Ru-sia also is landing troops on the northern coast to protect the flank of the
army on the Yalu.
It is probable that after disposing of the Russian Vladivostok squadron the Japanese will begin a
land and sea attack upon Vladivostok, simultaneously with the investment or Port Arthur, while their Korean
army attempts to wrest the frontier from the foe and cross the Yalu for an invasion of Manchuria,

ported to have been damaged and sent back to Sasebo for repairs. The increase of Togo's strength
indicated that Admiral Uriu's division had joined the main fleet, and that there were no Japanese
warships, remaining in northern waters. This probably was the case, but after assisting for a short
time in the bombardment of Port Arthur, Uriu's ships withdrew, steamed hurriedly to Sasebo for a
fresh supply of coal, and then, making a wide detour, appeared unexpectedly before Vladivostok last
Sunday morning.
The result was just what the Japanese expected. Believing themselves in no danger from at
tack, the Russian cruisers had again left Vladivostok for a raid in Japanese waters, or to cover the
landing of troops in Northern Korea. . Their retreat is now cut off, and the "flying squadron,"
which was dispatched after the sailing of Uriu northward, is fast approaching the vicinity where,
it is t>elieved, the Russians will be found. It is not improbable that a naval battle has already been
fought. -

The great and effective work ol
Stuarfa Dyspepsia Tablets Is no longer
confined to America. They are being
used now all over the world, for their
fame has spread throughout foreign
countries and they cure dyspepsia in
all lands and all climates Just as well
as they do at home. In fact, sur-
rcundlngs and conditions never inter-
fere with the successful work o!
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets, not even
the conditions of the stomach itself.
They go ahead in their own natural
way regardless of the stomach and
digest thÂ« food that the bad stomach
cannot digest and permit .that organ
to do just as it pleases, rest up, taka
a vacation, get well or what not. ThÂ«
stomach, however, always makes it a
point to get well when it has nothing
else to do. That's what stomachs al-
ways have done and will continue ta
do when they have the opportunity.
A prominent Detroit physician says:
"I prescribe Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets
for all cases of stomach trouble.- 1
have tried many prescriptions, includ-
ing a number of my own, but find
nothing that gives such 'universal re-
lief as this remedy. They are natural
harmless and thoroughly effective In
their work, and while I have a natural
antipathy to patent medicines, I do
not hesitate to prescribe and recom-
mend Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets on ai
occasions."
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are foi

They are so well known and theii
popularity is so great that a drussisi

monial of the physician is no excep-

he said, but the means of transporta
tion beyond Lake Baikal were.inade
quate, and he was about to send 120
locomotives and 2000 cars beyond the
lake In order to move the troops more
rapidly.
General Sakharoff declared that the
number of troops to go to Manchuria
had not yet been fixed; he would send
what was necessary, and he admitted
that the minimum would be 400.0Q0.
The question of supplying the army
with provisions did not cause anxiety.
General Sakharoff said he had no

the troops from Port Arthur, leaving

There is no truth in thereports that
the Japanese fleet bombarded Vladi

vanced here for the appearance of the
Japanese In northern waters is their
probable desire to regain possession of
the Island of Saghallem which was
ceded to Russia by Japan. It is point
ed out that the whole of Northern
Japan will be. threatened with famine
if the -food supply derived from the
island of. Sagrhalien fisheries is Cut off.
Nine-tenths of the exports go to Japan;
in addition to which Japanese boats
have been carrying on piratical fishing
along the coast, which has exhausted
the fish supply of the Amur estuary.
The native tribes there are suffering

protection to the fisheries as soon, as
the river is free, from ice.

The Emperor has just assented to
the formation of a volunteer corps of

Montenegrins and Servians, to go to
the front, but on condition that they

respect for hard service and be sec

A greater danger, however, lies in
the possibility of war not being con

SPRINGFIELD. Ohio, March 8.â
Five companies of the Ohio National
Guard are on their way on a special
train by order of Governor Herrick in
response to a request of thÂ« city and
county officials.
During the afternoon threats were
heard that the levee, the negro sec
tion, would be burned. It is said the
negroes are determined to avenge the
lynching of Dixon. Fearful of the con
sequence of the mutteiings about the
city, a conference was held in the
Mayor's office to-night by the Mayor,
the Sheriff, two members of the Board
of Public Safety, the County Prosecu
tor and others.
As a result of this deliberation a tel
gram was sent to Governor Herrick
asking for six companies of militia and
requesting that the local companies
be stationed In their armories. In re
sponse to this the Mayor received a
telegram to the effect that the request
would be compiled with at once and
asking that the Governor be kept fully
advised on the situation. The saloons
were ordered closed.
At 11:20 the threat of the mob, fre
quently made through the day and
evening, was finally made good and a
volume of flame was 1 seen La shoot up
from the rear of a place occupied by
"Les" Thomas, a saloon-keeper. Pre
ceding the firing of. the building, the
mob at a distance of 100 feet, shot at
the front of the building for half an
hour, but it la not known whether any
of the occupants had remained In the
building and If they did whether any
fatalities resulted from the shooting.
The fire spread both ways from Thom
as' i>lace.
It is thought the mob will not toler
ate any effort of the Fire Department
to put out the flre in the levee dis
trict, buVwill offer no resistance in the
attempts to confine the flre to the
buildings along Washington street.
known as the levee. These buildings
are old frame structures, ranging from
one to three stories In height. They
are for the most part saloons, dwell
ings and small rooming-houses. There
are a few branch offices maintained by
downtown firms in the vicinity. To
the north of the levee, or "Washington
street, running parallel with it. is East
High street, the most beautiful as well
as the most fashionable thoroughfare
in the city. There is little or no dan
ger, however, of the flre spreading to
this thoroughfare.
At midnight the entire block on
Washington street, from Gallagher
west to Spring, is on flre, with no
hope of saving any of the buildings.
The troops from Cincinnati. Mlamis
burg and Dayton will be here on a
special train within fifteen minutes.
They are urgently needed, as it is en
tirely probable that the negroes will
make good their threats to flre the
business district of the city and dyna
mite the jail and other county build
ings.
At 2:30 o'clock this morning the
flre had burned itself out and both
mob and spectators have for the most
part dispersed. Quiet prevails and
the mob Is evidently well satisfied
with its night's work. Probably
twenty small buildings were destroyed
by fire.

February 28.
Five hundred marines are due to ar
rive from Washington, D. C, at 4 a. m.
on Thursday. Special tugs will convey
them to the transport dock and they
will board the transport Buford, which
is now scheduled to sail sharp at noon
the same day.
The ..avy Department yesterday
supplied the different officers of the di
vision and department at headquarters
in the Phelan building with large and
comprehensive maps of Korea, China
and Japan, and also of Panama and
environments. These now adorn the
walls of the different offices and were
consulted with much interest by the
officers yesterday.
Prominent among the officers are
Colonel Henry Wygant, Twenty-sec
ond * Infantry; Lieutenant Colonel
Henry P. McCain; Major Frank de L.
Carrington, First Infantry; Major
Leonard A. Lovering, inspector gener
al's department, Manila; Major George
H. G. Gale, Inspector general's de
partment, Manila, and Major John Els
ton Baxter, quartermaster's depart
ment. The Thomas will be due here
late Monday night or early Tuesday
morning. .
The 230 mules which arrived from
Missouri two weeks ago and have been
quartered on the Presidio flats do not
take kindly to their environment; at
least, they haven't taken kindly to the
climate they have come into. SevucaJ
of them have died, several are sick,
and they seem to nearly all present a
sort of mopish appearance. The strong
breezes that float in through the Golden
Gate are apparently too strong for
their constitutions. T'ley are destined
for service in Manila and will be sent
there as soon as the transport Dix Is
ready to receive them. -
The fine new gymnasium at the Pre
sidio is now practically completed and
will be thrown open for the use of en
listed men of the post next Monday.
Lieutenant Beauford R. Camp will
have charge of the management of this
useful addition to the post. With Cap
tain Louis R. Burgess he is busily en
gaged in drawing up the rules and
regulations which will govern the
running of that Institution. The build
ing and apparatus has cost Uncle Sam
somewhere in the vicinity of $50,000.
MAPS OF SEAT OF WAR.
Troop L Ninth Cavalry, under com
mand of Captain Charles Young, will
be the attacking party, and will ad
vance upon the McDowell-avenue en
trance, adjacent to the golf club house.
Troops K, L and M, under command
of Major Bigelow, will reconnoiter the
grounds of the Presidio over different
portions, with the idea of trying to
locate the spot at which the enemy is
liable to attack the post. The exer
cises will begin at 8:30 a, m.
The transport Thomas Bailed on Mon
day afternoon from Honolulu for this
port. Besides the Eleventh Infantry
and 400 Philippine scouts she brings a
large number of casuals.
OFFICERS COMING HO^IE.
Major Bigelow, commander of the
Third Squadron, Ninth Cavalry, is
still keeping up the vigorous drilling
that has characterized his work since
he took charge of his command at the
Presidio. For to-day he has outlined
what is termed problem field exercise.
From the elaborate preparations made
it should not only be a fine and ex
haustive drill for the troopers, but at
the same time it should be a pictur
esque sight for the onlooker. It practi
cally consists of an attack from the
enemy from the outside of the post,
and the attempt of those in charge of
the Dost to hold the situation.
Blank cartridges -will be fired galore
and the exercise is intended to smack
in every way of actual warfare.
The police arrived soon, and a search
of the place by them failed to reveal
the burglars.
Five minutes after the police had
gone Henley was standing in front of
the house when one of the much
sought burglars rushed from the base
ment of the place, and, almost knock-
Ing the startled Henley over, rushed
down Laguna street. His pal was seen
to emerge from Jefferson Park and
join him. The two were pursued by
Henley, but escaped.
The brave action of the little girl was
highly commended. The /allure of the
police to find the hiding man Is a mys
tery.
The bravery of a little thirteen-year
old girl prevented the burglarizing of
the home of Jacob Meyer at 1115 Turk
street Monday night. .The neighbor
hood for a time was in a state of great
excitement. The, Â¦ police were sum
moned, but failed to find the burglars.
The Meyer family went .to a party
and left the little girl at home. The
child sat in the front room with the
gas out and looked into the street. She
noticed two men watching the house
from the opposite side of the street,
but thought nothing of it. A few min
utes later she went to a corner gro
cery to purchase some candy. "When
she returned she noticed that the men
were gone. On entering the house she
heard the burglars at work In the base
ment. She did not scream, but quietly
telephoned to Mrs. Meyer, telling her
there were burglars in the house.
Mrs. Meyer and her sons, Julius and
Herman, immediately rushed home.
The police were telephoned for. Julius
Meyer seized a revolver and stood at
an upstairs back window, waiting for
the burglars to appear.
Mrs. Meyer began screaming and a
police whistle was blown. These noise3
brought Charles Henley, a musician, to
the house. He went bravely in search
of the burglar in the cellar, though un
armed. He found no one.

British experts believe that the main Japanese army will disembark on the eastern coast of Ldao
tung Peninsula, between Port Arthur and the Yalu River. This would place the Russians on the Yalu at
a disadvantage, compelling them to resist a flank attack wlille facing the Japanese army advancing
through Korea. It has been claimed by the Russians that, because of physical disadvantages, it would be
impossible to land a largo army on the eastern shore of the peninsula, but the resourcef nl " brown men
may prove them to have been mistaken. " According to the Ix>ndon Times, Japan has available at present
about 170,000 men for the commencement of her land operations.
There is an army of Japanese spies in "Manchuria, and Tokio's strategists are kept fully Informed of
Russia's military operations. The Russians are bending every effort toward the strengthening of their
position on the Linoiung Peninsula and the defense of Port Arthur from a land attack. A network of
entrenchments has been thrown up to guard all approaches to the endangered city.
Russia's army mobilization has preceded v. so satisfactorily that Commander in Chief Kuropatkin has
decided to hasten his departure to the front. He will start next Sunday. Until his arrival in Manchuria
the Russians probably will act purely on the defensive. 1 ,
Bulgarian, Montenegrin and Servian volunteers will serve In the Russian army, the Czar having sanc
tioned their enlistment. y â¢
According to a report from Tokio the Russians have succeeded- after all hi floating the battleship
Retvlzan and the cruiser Askold and the salvage of the Cesarevitch is proceeding satisfactorily. This news,
coming from a Japanese source, indicates that the Port Arthur fleet has entirely recovered from the blow
dealt by Admiral Togo at the outbreak of the war. .
Japan, despite official denials made, only recently, will attempt to negotiate a war loan hi the United
States. It is added in the dispatch making this announcement that the funds are not actually neded, but
that it is deemed best to prepare for eventualities, Japan evidently believing that the war may last for
years.
From the Japanese capital comes a report that there has been a naval battle in the sea of Japan and
that the Russian Vladivostok squadron has been captured or destroyed. \ No verification has come from
any source, but news of a sea fight has been expected ever since Japanese warships cut off the retreat
of the Russian squadron to the harbor of Vladivostok.

The Butchers' Union held a meeting
last nieht and it vwis decided to stand
by the fight. It is reported that every
member of the union has remained
loyal, despite the lockout, and that
not a man has deserted.
. Efforts of various kinds are being
made by the union men to meet the
conditions, but nothing has been ac
complished as yet. An effort â¢ was
made to-day to get the slaughter
house men into the fight for the union
and to have them refuse to dress meat
for the wholesalers. It is claimed
that two-thirds of the stockyards men
are members of the union. The^effoft
to get the Cooks' and Walters' Union
into the fight for the butchers has
practically failed. Many of the res
taurant proprietors have agreed to
stand by the boss butchers if their em
ployes support the union . workmen.
The most important effort that is being
made is to get the Eastern unions into
the fight and prevent the butchers
here who refuse to recognize the
union from getting any supplies from
the big packing-houses.
ThiC other butcher-shops in Oakland
are still in nearly full operation. The
bosses are helping each other out in
every way. In some cases the deliv
ery of meat has been delayed or
stopped, but as a general rule the
bosses say that they are getting along
In first-class shape. Fred Becker,
around whom is the main fight, said
to-day that he could get forty non
union men, enough to stock every mar
ket in Oakland. He added that the
bosses would never recognize the
unjon. ,
Another pro-union butcher-shop
closed its doors to-night because it
was unable to get meat, but aside
from this there was little change in
the butchers' strike. Robert Vincent,
on Washington street, near Seventh,
sold his last piece of meat to-night,
and not being able to replenish his
supply he was compelled to shut up
shop. Neither Vincent nor Nevin, who
closed yesterday for the' same reason,
has signed the employers' agreement.
Paul Wuthe. East Oakland; Neuman
& Korn, corner of Sixth and Clay
streets, and George H. Minall, corner
of Twelfth and West streets, still have
supplies of meat and will run as union
markets.

; Quite different was Manuel Monreal's
action last night, when he saw a man
try to raise a window and enter the
rear of the Monreal house at 269 Ninth
street. Though Manuel is only 12 'years
old, he pluckily called to his sister,
who telephoned for the police. The
man, however, fled. Young Manuel rah
after him and captured the fugitive
with the help of Citizens T. A. Sogdon
and F. Clark. The prisoner, "William
G. Bond, was Kent to the City Prison
by Patrolman Cockerton. Bond said
he was employed at the American
House. He was Identified by Monreal
and his ?!ster.
Touched -by the plea of a burglar

employed by Fred P. Cutting at 1420
Harrison street allowed the surprised
intruder to depart before she realized
that he , was a very daring daylight
thief who had packed up a lot of the
Cuttings' family silverware prepara
tory to fleeing with it. The meeting
between girl and burglar occurred yes
terday afternoon. Not until to-day
were the police notified.
To the detectives the servant Â«aid
the man had made such a plea she?
could not find the heart to call the
police. He had said he was starving
and suffering from ecmsumption and
that arrest would kill him. The de
tectives took a description of the thief
and said a few things mentally about
the case.

BERKELEY. March 8â The re/usal of the
Students' Affairs Committee tf> lay down defi
nite rules for the guidance of the students en
Charter day promises a rupture between that
body and the members of the nenlor das*. In
the past the seniors have co-operated on Charter
day to prevent a clash between the students of
the three lower classes. There was so much
trouble over the rush of laBt year that Max
Thelen, president of the senior class, and sev
eral other seniors asked the Student*' Affairs
committee to fix a definite rule of discipline for
this year. This the committee refused to do,
Faying that all it expected of the students was
to act like gentlemen. Such a vague rule was
not acceptable to Thelen and his friends, and
an ultimatum will bÂ« delivered to the commit
tee requesting something more definite or the
seniors will refuse to assist the faculty on
Charter day. The ground for the committee's
lefusal to acquiesce in the demand of the
seniors is that it is net academic to fix any
specific rules for the disciplining of students.

A new tack was taken to-day by the
heirs of the estate of William Dove
to gain possession of a valuable piece
of real estate at Tenth street and
Broadway held by the Blake-Moffltt
estate. William Dove, son of the man
who originally owned the land, was
granted letters of administration on his
father's estate to-day by Judge Greene.
He thereupon instituted suits of eject
ment against the tenants of the prem
ises as the administrator of the es
tate.
A fine legal point has been raised in
regard. to 'the ownership of: the land.
Mr. Dove Sr. died in 1862." His widow,
without probating his estate, sold the
property after her marriage to a man
named Armstrong. There " were four
children, whose interest in their fath
er's estate was entirely overlooked, and
it is the eldest son who has now asked
to be appointed administrator of the
estate, and seeks to â¢ assert 'Â¦ title : to a
piece of realty valued at . about 550,000
which has been an asset of the Blake
estate : for more than a quarter of a
century. r r : ' ' . : .~
The point made by Colonel T. V.
Eddy, attorney for Dove, is that; no
legal title could have passed from Mrs.
Armstrong* to the Blakes to this piece
of property. ' Adverse possession, he
says, could not cut any figure in the
present case,' as there is no adverse,

estate .was "never probated. Mrs. Arm-,

ALAHEDA, March 8. â Although
the family of William M. Schwartz of
1306 Ninth street had known Louis B.
Wiley, who was found asphyxiated by
illuminating gas at 41 Ootavia street,
San Francisco, yesterday, for a
year, they learned but little of his life
prior to the time of making his ac

Mrs. Schwartz said: "We had known
Mr. Wiley about a year, but for the
last eight months we had not seen him.
He was acquainted with my sister,
Miss Wilson, and apparently took a
fancy to her, but the relation was only
of a friendly nature. He ( did hot give
us the impression that he' had a wife.
He was a traveling man and had
friends but no relatives in Smartsville
that we ever heard him speak of. He
once mentioned his mother, who, I
think he said, lived in New York State.
We do not know what business Wiley
was engaged in at the time of- his
death." {7^1-}';

Much speculation concerning the
men behind Macdonald in the pur
chase of these franchises has been
indulged. The that the South
ern Pacific'* hand is in the deal is ac
cepted by a few. but the most of the
street talk points to prominent bank

ests as the real persons concerned In
the deal.
Within five days Macdonald will
have to file a $5000 bond to fulfill the
provisions of the franchises.

wasn't a sign of them by the time the
policeman was', well started after the
thugs. The shooting aroused the
neighborhood. Mrs. Charles L. Hede

Unfortunately, Policeman Hall was
unable to get a fair sight of the men.
As soon as they saw him both burglars
commenced shooting from the front
porch of the Herr place. They Jumped
down and separated be Hall dropped to
the ground to avoid the bullets. One
burglar ran around the east side of the
Herr place and the other started west.
This burglar was within four feet of
Hall and he fired a shot at the pros
trate patrolman. Then the fugitive
ran through an alley on the west fide
of Herr's house, Hall sending one shot
after the fleeing man.
OAKLAND, March 8.â Detectives have
been busy to-day In an effort to trace
the pair of desperate housebreakers
who tried last night to kill Policeman
Alfred J. Hall when he. surprised them
trying to force an entrance to Henry
Herr's residence, 1062 Fifty-fourth
street. That the men are responsible
for the large number of recent bur
glaries that have occurred In that sec
tion of the city the police have no
doubt, hence they have double cause to
capture the murderous prowlers.
"I was walking east on Fifty-fourth
street and was directly in front of the
Herr place, before I saw the two men
working at the front bay window. They
must have seen me first, because both
of them commenced to shoot at me. I
dropped to the ground and tried-. to
draw. my pistol, but my long uniform
coat obstructed my pocket so much
that I did not get my weapon into ac
tion until after one of the burglars had
run by me into the alley between, the
Herr and Hedemark houses.
"This burglar took a shot at me that
was so close it powder-burned my
face. l' managed to get one shot at
him, but it evidently didn't hit him, be
cause he kept on running. Both men
Â¦were out of sight by the time I got
back of the houses behind which they
disappeared."
his pistol. At the Herr residence Mrs.
Herr and two daughters, occupying a
room the window of which opened on
the porch, heard the burglars at work,
but she said to-dav she thought the
noise was made by a dog on the porch.
Mrs. Herr paid no attention to the dis
turbance until the shooting startled
her and she went to the window, but
saw nothing, the burglars having dis
appeared, with the policeman after
them.
Earl Hedemark, I a boy, found bul
lets to-day imbedded in the earth near
where Hall dropped. They were turned
over to the police.

University of California to-day after
a month's trip in the East, devoted
principally to looking over the ground
in behalf of two department* of the
urm-ersity, which will be improved
and enlarged. The departments re

MERCHANTS TROUBLED.
HONOLULU, March 2.â The finances
of the Territory of Hawaii are hardly
in satisfactory shape. This is largely
due to the expenditures of the Dole
administration, which incurred many
liabilities when there was no money
in the treasury, leaving their payment
to be settled out of subsequent reve
nues. The Legislature, moreover, ap
propriated $1,000,000 more than will be
received from all sources of revenue,
and that amount has to be saved some
where. Even . with expenses cut down
to salaries and the minimum amount
for current accounts there will be $800,
000 of debt outstanding next Novem
ber, and this sum must be paid from
taxes then falling due. and which are
supposed to carry on the Government
until June 30, 1905.

Banker Spaulding has informed the
Governor that the general volume of
business has decreased, that securities
have shrunk, that money is not avail
able to meet the requirements of the
community and that the position of the
Government is adding to the hard times
and the generally depressed situation.
He further stated that the banks are
no't satisfied as to the legal security
tendered them for advances made to
the Government, and that there is no
legal requirement making it incumbent
upon the treasurer to pay back such
loans from taxes. Legal opinions have
also been secured to the effect that
Government warrants cannot be used
against taxes. Under these circum
stances the bankers wanted to be as
sured of their security and the legality
of the warrants.
Governor Carter promised the busi-
by November and see that economy
was practiced in every possible man
ner, and since then he has been busily
engaged in shaving down various sal
ary and exoense items In the Govern
ment appropriations. During the inter
view, which was quite lenythy. there
was some sharp and pointed discussion,
showing a lack of harmonious interest
between the business community and
the administration.
After paying off the February Â«ala
ries there was a balance left in the
treasury of about $300, but at the close
of business yesterday there was not one
dollar left for salaries and current ex
penses of government.

Seventeen persons in a hundred in the
State of New York live to be over sev
Â«nty years of age.
Mrs. Robinson is very well known
in this city and has the reputation of
being rather Bohemian. Her marriage
Into the army came as a great sur
prise to those who were acquainted
with her and many were of the opin
ion that army socials and dances, to
gether with stripes and brass buttons,
had their influence in bringing about
the marriage.
Harry V. Arnold, who was married
to Martha Washington Decker Arnold
in New York in 1902. filed a suit for
divorce yesterday. He alleges deser
tion, charging that in September of
last year, when he requested his wife
to join him out here, she refused to do
so and has ever since continued to
live separate and apart from him.
Suits for divorce were also filed by
Abraham Greenwald against Esther
Greenwald for desertion, Thomas
Barnett against Rose Barnett for de
sertion. Finis K. Slarr against Caro
line E. Marr for infidelity, May Dem
ing against Richard Deming for de
sertion and Florence M. Schaller
against Edwin J. Schaller for cruelty.
Mrs. Schaller says her husband hurt
her feelings by cursing her and by
making her a target for his shoes.
Mary M. Rutherford, in a cross
complaint to the suit for divorce
brought by John J. Rutherford, ac
cuses him of cruelly beating her and
in her answer to his suit denies that
she ever was anything but a loving
and dutiful wife.
Decrees of divorce were granted to
Hulda Rundberg from Peter Rund
berg for desertion. Amret E. Hughes
from George Hughes for neglect and
Mary I. Dow from Clarence Dow for
neglect. Dow is the son of a Denver
banker.
Mrs. Swain was not destined to live
a single life, however, and in less than
two months after her first divorce had
been granted she fled with Lieutenant
Oliver Prescott Robinson to Reno, Xev.,
where they were married.
Shortly after their marriage the
ycning officer, who was at that time
Infatuated with his beautiful young
bride, was ordered to the Philippines.
There they remained until last July,
when Sirs. Robinson returned to this
city and went to the home of her moth
er at 733 Baker street.
In court yesterday Mrs. Robinson
charged her husband, who has recent
ly returned from the Philippines, with
having beaten her across the back with
a strap for being late for dinner, there
by hurting her feelings and her back.
She also states that Robinson used pro
fane and obscene language In address-
Ing her and accused her of being un
faithful.
The girl's parents, who were opposed
to the early marriage of their daugh
ter, attempted to have the marriage
annulled, as the girl was under age.
They were unable to do so, however,
and about a year afterward the wife
filed suit for divorce on the ground of
failure to provide. The divorce was
granted by Judge Dunne, to the grati
fication of the unhappy parents.
After two years of a decidedly un
happy married life, Mrs: Oliver Prea
cott Robinson, wife of Lieutenant
Prescott Robinson of the United States
army, was granted a divorce by Judge
Seawell yesterday on the ground* erf
cruelty.
Though Mrs; Robinson Is but 20 years
of age. she has been married twice,
both alliances terminating unhappily.
On July 21, 1S99, when but 15 years of
age, Ethel Johnson eloped with Henry
Ellis Swain, son of E. SI. Swain, a
prominent local dentist. The two run
aways went to Alameda, where they
were married. For the 'long period of
two weeks things went smoothly in the
Swain home, but after that the hus
band tired of home life and was sel
dom seen in the house.
Though but Twenty Years
: of Age She Is Victim of
Two Unhappy Marriages
John Brown, able seaman, occupied a
room in a Vallejo street boarding-house
with another son of Xeptune last Sun
day night, and when John rose from
his couch Monday morning and dressed
himself he substituted the other man's
coat for his own and went out. When
the other man awoke and discovered
his loss he hastened out and reported
to the police that in an inside pocket of
the missing garment was the sum of $15,
so Officer Clifford went forth to find and
succeeded in rounding up John Brown,
A. B. No money was found in the coat,
and John declared that he had not ab
stracted any cash from it, but was on
his way back to return it to Its owner,
having just discovered that it was not
his own, when the officer met him. In
lieu qf sufficient evidence to fasten the
crime of robbery upon John, that
Belle Chapelle, alias "Derby," was
"opening wine" in an O'Farrell-street
resort the other evening, when she
missed some of her money, and then
she disturbed the peace so energetically
that the proprietress of the place had
her arrested. She was fined $10 yester
day by Judge Cabaniss.
Since this woman entered the under
world her descent has been rapid. A
few years ago she suddenly flashed
into notoriety through being identified
as the "friend" of a French Vice Con
sul at this port who committed sui
cide, and since then she has frequently
posed in the police courts. But from
the primrose path of luxurious folly
she has passed to the thorny roadway
of squalid degradation.
"Her finish is near," remarked a prac
tical policeman, as Belle faced the court
and vainly tried to resurrect some of
the old defiant spirit that once made
her an object of interest.
Charles H. Wright, who shot John
D. O'Brien, a Call reporter, last Friday
morning, has been held in $5000 bonds
to answer in the Superior Court the
charges of burglary and attempting to
murder. His companion in crime, Rob
ert Weeden. was placed under bonds of
$3000 on the single accusation of bur
glary.
The two young desperadoes sat in
Police Judge Mogan's court yesterday
and nonchalantly listened to a recoun
tal of their felonious work. Weeden
was without coat or vest, those articles
having been taken from him to serve
as evidence that they had been stolen.
Wright calmly looked at the witnesses
as they testified and occasionally shift
ed his glance to the spectators that
crowded the space outside the rail.
When the story of the burglary and
shadowing of the defendants had been
told, Mr. O'Brien related his thrilling
struggle with Wright for possession
of the revolver with whir" the latter
tried to shoot Policeman Keohane, and
how he was shot through the leg by
deflecting the muzzle of the weapon
aimed at his body. He fully identified
Wright as the man who wounded him.
Officers Keohane and O'Connor gave
corroborative testimony, and the keeper
of the lodging-house on Kearny street
in which the defendants roomed also
furnished damaging evidence against
them. Xo defense was attempted, and
the cases were promptly sent to the
higher court.
While the hearing was in progress
the pistol taken from Wright lay, with
several detached cartridges, upon the
stenographer's table, where either of
the defendants could have obtained
possession of them by simply stretch
ing out his hand. In course of iden
tification the weapon was picked up
and returned to the table several times,
and each time it was sharply followed
by Wright's keen glance. Judge Mo
gan was first to perceive the tempta
tion that confronted the fellow whose
desperate character had been proved.
A sharp look at Wright's face appar
ently decided the Judge's mind, for he
quietly took the weapon from the hand
of the prosecuting attorney and laid it
upon the desk in front of him, saying,
"I believe it would be safer to keep It
up here."
Every one in court understood the
significance of the action and the
words. Wright and Weeden exchanged
a questioning glance, and then both
smiled In a sickly way.
Peter Dariot swore that the trousers
stolen from him by John Leichmann
could be purchased for $2, but Judge
Fritz sentenced John to three months'
Imprisonment Just the same.

Edna Dobbins was told by Judge
Fritz to go back to her home In Wat
sonville and stay there if she desires
to escape the fate of a wayward
woman, which is worse than death. '
The girl was with her "chum," Ada
Simpson, in a Barbary Coast dance
hall when they were arrested as va
grants. In court Jt came to light that
Ada, although under 18 years of age,
had been twice married and not once
divorced, so she Is held for bigamy.
Miss Dobbins promised to follow the
Judge's advice.
"That's the way to talk, Walter;"
said the court encouragingly; "and
for your own sake I hope you mean
what you say. The older you grow
the more firmly will you become con
vinced â unless, you are a greater fool
than I take you to be â that honesty is
the best policy. Now go to work, and
may good luck accompany you."
Walter was "spieling" for a Dupont
street bunko game when the police ar
rested him for vagrancy.
Walter J. Burt, aged 21 years, stood
before Judge Mogan and declared that
he had completely changed his mind
as to the comfort and convenience of
leading an honeat life in preference, to
subsisting by trickery.
"I have got a job," said Walter,
"and it's me to work if you let me go.
No. more faking for yours truly. I've
had my experience and I'm through
with it."
"And you celebrated the reunion by
making a punching bag of your old
friend, eh?" queried the court.
"Well, we had a few drinks "
"Ah, and your spirit of friendliness
toward the complainant became
stimulated to such a degree of exuber
ance that it could only find vent in
fistic exercise. I remember having
seen a comedian at one of the local
theaters express his affection for an- (
other comedian N by choking him,, but
that was on the mimic stage and the
assailed one was not injured. In this
case the circumstances are quite dif
ferent and I must remand you, John
Riley, until I figure out the sentence
that will best fit you."
"We were old friends, your Honor,
and had not met for years," said John
Riley, when Mogan asked why
he had assauKed and battered William
Spellman. â¢Â¦

The wife of John Hamilton, machin
ist, left his bed and. board a week ago
and went to reside at the home of her
brother-in-law, John Larsen, 3S61
Eighteenth street. Mr. Hamilton brave
ly withstood the strain of abandonment
until Monday, when his , spirit wilted
and he sought solace in fiery liquids.
John Larsen yesterday informed Judge
Mogan that John Hamilton was ."drunk
when he visited the Larsen dwelling
Monday evening and fired two shots
through a glass door panel after lie had
been refused permission to enter. Mr.
Hamilton's defense will be heard on
March 11.
"Well, I'll continue this case until
you can think out the exact number,"
pleasantly remarked the court.
, After scratching his head and exhib
iting other signs of memory-raking,
Martini said he remembered four Incar
cerations, but there might possibly have
been others which he had forgotten.
David D. Martini was before Judge
Mogan on. a charge of having, threat
ened to, kill Bertrand Malta, a Broad
way saloon-keeper, from whose place of
business he had been ejected after he
had obtained a drink and refused to
pay for it. He stood upon the sidewalk,
witnesses stated, and- brandished a
knife at Maita and invited him to step
outside and be carved.
"You have been in Jail, haven't you?"
Inquired the Judge, glancing searching;
ly at the defendant's swarthy face.
An affirmative nod was the reply.
"How often have you been in jail?"
In the court of Judge Cabaniss a sec
ond charge of â¢ burglary was entered
against Charles Johnson, who had been
caught while attempting to rob the jew
elry store of Cohn' Bros., 1034 Market
street, last Monday, night. .It was
proved that just prior to that adventure
the defendant had entered the apart
ment of J. B. Fillman at 1032 Market
street and taken therefrom a suit of
clothes, with ,which 4 he ascended to the
roof and there attired himself, leaving
the cast-offs behind. He was held to
answer on both charges.
charge was dismissed yesterday by
Judve Cabanlss.

rKIUIANEXCE OF CURE.
The Chief Merit.
Many so called pile remedies will
alTord the user Flight, tempor-
ary relief, and the majority of
sufferers do not expect more .
than this. Women especially, af- .
ter having tried every preparation
recommended for the cure of Piles,
have come to the conclusion that there
is no cure except by an operation. This
is rightfully viewed with dread, be-
cause of the shock to the delicate ner- â¢
vÂ«>us system of women, and many of â¢
those afflicted have resigned them-
p^lvets to the situation with never a ,
:houpht that there is any help in sight
for them.
We invite the attention of all such ;
to th<Â» experience of the lady whose ad-
dress is given below:
. "I feel it my duty to recommend the
Pyramid Pile Cure. for. after suffering
un years with a most distressing form ]
of Piles, I am entirely cured; thanks (
to this remedy. Any one doubting: this .
can write to Margaret Brady, 156 Whit- '
man street, Cleveland. Ohio." J
Ten months later she writes: "I am !
p!ad to say that I am still perfectly â¢
free from Piles, and have not had the
slightest trouble since I first used your '
remedy. I am well known in Cleveland. '
and have advertised Pyramid Pile Cure (

ENLISTMENTâ Subscriber. Geyser
vHle, Cal. It has been held that mere
ly enlisting in the military or naval
service of a foreign sovereign does not
by itself work expatriation of a citizen
of the United States. Naturalization is
the highest but not the only evidence
of expatriation. Such acts, in addition
to the selection and enjoyment of a
foreign domicile as amount to a re
nunciation of United States citizenship
Â«Â»nd a willingness to submit to or adopt
the obligations of a citizen of the
country or domicile, such as accepting
public employment, engaging in mili
tary service, etc.. may be treated by
the United States Government as af
fecting expatriation. By expatriation Is
meant the renouncing of the citizenship
of one country to adopt that of an
other. A man may change his citlsen
crnp. but he cannot change his na- *
tionallty.
The Naval Register for 1904, giving
the date of duty or leave of all the
officers in the navy to January 1, has
been published and distributed by the
Navy Department. As an official rec
ord it is of little value, owing to the
large number of inaccuracies, many of
which are so flagrant as to attract at
tention at once. Thl3 carelessness in
preparation manifested itself two years
ago and the blunders have appeared
in five subsequentf annual and semi
annual issues. The errors are espe
cially numerous in the list of the lower
grad.es, no less than nineteen lieuten
ants, nine Junior lieutenants and
thirty-three ensigns being credited to
wrong ships or other duty at dates
that were v incorrect. Thus Lieutenant
Edward Woods, who appeared in the
Register of 1902 as assigned to the
Monterey on April 4, 18 98, is now
credited to the Mayflower under date
of April 4, 1898. Lieutenant C. T.
Owens is recorded as attached to the
Hist. since June 18. 1807, and yet this
vessel was not acquired by the navy
untilMay, 1S98. A third mistake is
in. crediting Lieutenant W. R. Sexton
to the torpedo-boat Dale since Decem
ber 15, 1899. There Is a torpedo-boat
destroyer named Dale, launched July
34, 1900. and placed in commission Oc-

In a recent "debate in the United States Senate the in

fancies and satisfy,; the luxurious tastes of some of our

EARTHQUAKESâ A Readefl City.
The cause of earthquakes has never
been discovered. F. W. Rudler, an emi
nent physicist, in an article contributed
to the Encyclopedia Brltanntca says:
"Even at the present day, after all that
has been written on the subject, but
little is known as to the origin of earth
quakes." Numerous theories have been
presented as to the origin of the quakes,
but the prevailing opinion is that what
ever their origin, whether from on a
cause or various causes, the vibrations
of every earthquake can be traced to a
focus within the earth, and that this
lies directly beneath the' point of great
est disturbance.

A number of racetrack men were
standing in the betting ring at Oakland
the other day. One of them, who was
rather hard of hearing, had Just hit the
books for a heavy roll of the green
goods, and consequently he was the
center of an admiring throng, especial
ly those gentlemen known to be in the
tout class.
The lucky one absorbed the flatter
ings of the multitude for a few minutes
and then, becoming tired, started away
to place a bet on another likely one. He
had gone but a short distance when he
was approached by a tout all out of
breath and to a hurry.
"Say, can you slip me $10 till to
morrow," said the tout. " "I need the
coin bad and I have a live one In sight."
"What's that?" asked the- one about
to be touched. "I can't understand a
word you say."
"I said," shouted the tout,,,"can you
lend me $20 till to-morrow?"
"Oh, I thought you said ten a minute
ago,", answered the lucky man.
The tout strolled away to look for
something easy.

to a cinder. Roast duck, cooked by
lightning, reads like a. novelty, even ia

Nearing the Limits '
iâx RESIDENT SMITH is. indeed a patriarch, no mat
r"^ ter what his merits as a prophet. He admitted to
â¢*Â¦ the Senate that he "is the father of forty-two chil
dren, all living â twenty-one boys and twenty-one girls,
and is proud of them all. Eleven of them have been
added to the census since the revelation abandoning
polygamy was communicated through President Wood
ruff. The race may suicide, but the Smith family has a
promise of continuance. . = â¢ vu-
Mr. Smith must be a thrifty person to support the ex-:
pense of such an extensive establishment. Utah cannot
make a more attractive exhibit at the St. Louis fair than
these, forty-two children, their one father and their five
mothers. If accompanied by a history of their bringing
up, it would give the country valuable hints in domestic
economy. Did Smith walk the floor with the batch when
they were in the juvenile agonies of cutting teeth? Did
he help steer them through the chicken-pox, croup,
measles, mumps and the other ailments of infancy? Does
he support an exclusive family tailor, dressmaker, doctor
and shoe cobbler? Of course he needs no domestic chap
lain," for he can do-all that business himself. Do they all
run out to meet him and clamor for peanuts and candy
and search his pockets for small change? How is it at
Christmas? Do they hang up eighty-four stockings for
him to fill with sweetmeats, mechanical toys and Noah's
arks?
Mr. Brigham Roberts, who had a little collision with
the House of Representatives in which he was derailed,
preached a fervent sermon last Sunday in Salt Lake, in
which he expressed his joy that President Smith's testi
mony to the Senate committee had put the great truths
of Mormonism before millions who could not have
known them otherwise. May we suggest that the presi
dent's evidence also puts a little too much family before
millions, in proportion to the sacred truths that decorate
it?
The world has feared that it would be overrun by
Smiths, and here is this one leading the vast army with
forty-two more Smiths. As his record is forty-two, his
twenty-one boys may be expected to enter the competi
tion, and if they do as wellthe result will be 882 more
Smiths.. At this rate the Jones and Robinson families
will find no place to lay their heads. The name of Utah
will be changed to Smith and the gospel trumpet will
call Smiths exclusively to salvation.
Brigham Young is not in it any more, though he flpur
ished before the anti-polygamy law. His successor in
the presidency has done quite well in* spite of the law.
He is president and prophet, parent at large, and also a
director of the Union Pacific Railroad. As such he
has transportation privileges.. When these forty-eight
Smiths, father, mothers and children, take a trip on direc
tors' passes, what chance is there for the non-polyga
mous public to get a berth in a Pullman, or a seat in a
day car, or room in the diner?
Brigham Roberts may be right about the advertising
the truths of Mormonism are enjoying, "but he may be
wrong about the favorable effect. The Grand Jury in
Salt Lake will have work on its hands when the presi
dent returns, to the' : bosoms of his five" families.

A few definitions of Chinese geo
graphical prefixes and suffixes may bÂ«
of service in elucidating the nomencla
ture of current war news. First, pre
fixes: Ta, as in Taku, means great.
and siao, as . in Siaopingthou, means
small. Pel or pe, nan, tung and si are
respectively north, south, east and
west. Thus the Pel Ho la the North
River, etc. Shang and hai are upper
and lower. Pal, hei and whang are
white, black and yellow. Suffixes are
more numerous and familiar. Klang,
ho tchuan, ula, muren and tchu each
and all mean river. Thus Yalu Klang
and Llao Ho are simply Talu River
and Liao River. Shui. kou, thsuan.
khi, gol and ussu are unfamiliar terms,
meaning a brook or small river. Hu,
nor and omo mean lake. as
in the well known Lob Nor. Po,
tse and tlen mean a small lake or
swamp, or a town situated near such
a place. Hai means sea; thus Whang
Hai Is the Yellow Sea. Tung Hai is the
Eastern Sea and Nan Hai Is the South
ern Sea. Tao, and sometimes shan.
means Island, but shan more often
means a m< untaln range. Ling is a
pass over a mountain range.
Handy Interpretations.
The agent told. his. story of the rob
bery to his employer, whom he found
sitting in the back office, with the safe
door open ready to receive the swag.
What was said there was never print
ed, but after that the percentage was
not carried through Fish alley.
It was in the '70's, and not when
Chief Crowley was in office, that a rob
bery occurred in Chinatown that was
never reported to the "upper" office.
There were reasons for not detailing
the detectives on the case, which may
be explained thus:
It was at the time when gambling
was rampant among the yellow devils,
and when gambling was prosperous in
Chinatown certain officials in the old
City Hall were fat.
At that time $3000 a month found its
way into an office on the ground floor
through a back door under the stair
way. This $3000 was payable on the 1st
and 15th of each and every month. The
$1500 was placed in a canvas sack in a
drawer at the residence of a Chinaman
on Jackson street, through which It
used to be taken through Fish alley
during the early hours of night to the
City. Hall.
On this particular night in December
while the' trusted agent was ' going
through Fish alleyÂ»with the booty un
der his heavy overcoat he was hit on
the head with a stuffed club and
knocked down by two fleet-footed men,
who grabbed the bag of gold and es
caped through a building into Dupont
street. Thence they went their way re
joicing.

The Bureau of Navigation Is charged
with supervision of the Navy Register
and the numerous errors are not those
of misprint, but solely due to incom
petence and indifference as to ac
curacy. The continuous repetition of
these blunders may be due to the fact
that the Bureau of Navigation has
been so much occupied with the gen

its control of naval affairs, as to en

On the edge of the Oriental quar

edge the daily newspapers have been
generously utilized by these ambitious
youngsters from Nippon.
For a long time one of their bright
fellow countrymen has been earning
a small fee by reading to classes of
young Japanese from the American
press and translating for the benefit of
his less fortunate listeners, who have
not yet mastered the English.
Since the outbreak of hostilities the
classes have increased and many boys
and young men have flocked to hear
the daily news from the East. The
little reader could see visions of much
increase to his Income by the demand
for his translations, but here the in
nate patriotism of the Japanese
cropped up. He would not seize the
splendid commercial advantage to be
gained and compel tribute from his
int'-sely concerned fellows. Not he.
Instead .the translator gave notice that
while the war lasted his services would
be gratis in dispensing war news to all
who could be accommodated in the
dingy clubhouse. And of such is the

the acme .of the efforts made in this direction at the Uni
versity of California. It was in the summer of 1900
that the first attempt was made by President Wheeler
to inaugurate a vacation school for the benefit of all
whose labors prevented a regular attendance upon the
university courses. The teaching, staff of that first school
was composed almost entirely of university professors.
The number of pupils was less than five Â¦ hundred. At
the last vacation school of 1903 there were more than
a thousand pupils enrolled, many of them from large
Eastern universities. The faculty scarcely fell short in
point of numbers of that engaged in the similar insti
tution at Harvard. With the announcements. of teachers
secured for the coming session, the University of Cah
fornia^has placed a higher standard upon the educational
worth of its proposed summer courses than that ever
achieved by Harvard or any other American university.
The coming of such great lights in the world of knowl
edge, even though, their instruction will 'be -completed in
a short six weeks, carries with it a profound prestige for
our State university. It is safe to say that no such ag
gregation of master intellects in the realms of thought
lias been gathered together at one time in the annals of
American culture. That such a gathering should be
brought about on the far rim of the continent, away from
the -centers of intellectual refinement and activity in the
East, is a significant earnest of what pur university is
doing for itself and for: the intellectual uplifting of the
Pacific Coast.

A street car conductor 'of Elizabeth; N. J., when ac
cused of bigamy frankly confessed that he had been mar
ried forty-seven times without submitting to the delay
inc process of a single divorce. How in the name of all
that is logical could the Mormons have missed this in
teresting! benedict? In a Utah environment what he
might have done would dazzle the imagination of a Turk.
The present situation greatly resembles that, and after
the campaign of this year it may go forward rapidly. In
making issues distinctive' and individual to itself, the ex*
isting Democracy is not successful. It has been weak
ened by expediency and opportunism.- It would probably
be in control of New York to-day but for Mr. Hill's plank
in the State platform favoring the expropriation of pri
vate property to Government ownership. He supposed
that the coal strike would popularize such a declaration,
but it did not, and his opportunism proved to be a sacri
fice of principle to expediency, made all in vain.
Mr. Gorman's reasons are plain. He represents organ
ized capital, and it has been behind him in the hope that
he could make an issue against President Roosevelt that
would be the instiument of his punishment for his en
forcement of the anti-trust laws. But this has been a
failure and the President remains, the representative of
anti-trust sentiment and of the optimism and progress of
the country. He is not making a campaign nor issues for
himself, but is doing his duty as he sees it regardless of
personal consequences. Senator Gorman, on the other
hand, sought to make issues for the benefit of .his ambi
tion and has failed. The people look upon these existing
issues of peace exactly as they have always looked upon
the issues of war. The administration represents the
building of the Panama canal and the enforcement of the
law equally, and while these issues are foremost in the
public mind the people will not swap horses while cross
ing the stream. ?.;;''
There is less partisanship in the country than for many
years, because the President has made himself the repre
sentative of great unpartisan issues in which the whole
people believe. It is interesting to observe that in the
canal matter he became the representative of a practical
ly unanimous Southern sentiment, while Mr. Gorman an
tagonized it. In regard to' the trusts, he represents the
whole country. . Why not let it go at that, and admit that
the public interests require that he carry out his plans
aligned with the interests of the country? That will be
the result, no matter what excursions Senator Gorman
may take among the prejudices of the people, in the at
tempt, to pipe them together in his support as a Presi
dential aspirant.
SENATOR GORMAN furnishes an example of judg
ment and astuteness gone astray, when touched
with ambition to be President. He had acquired a
great reputation as the safest and wisest tactician of his
party. He guided it through the breakers and over the
shoals of conllict with exceeding skill and courage, dur
ing his. former service in the Senate. When his State re
turned him, his appearance was hailed with great satis
faction and he was at once put in his old position as lead
er of the minority and chairman of its caucus.
He lost no time " in beginning to make politics, but
lie* was, consciously or unconsciously, making politics for
Gorman the Presidential aspirant, and not for the party
or the country. His first effort was to make a party is
sue against the Panama canal. At the time he did
this it was known that fifteen of his colleagues would
vote to ratify the treaty. Still he persisted, and was
driven at last to make an inglorious retreat, under cover
of some meaningless resolutions.
He then faced about and took up the development of
the navy as an issue, declaring it to be unnecessary, and
fa+'oring the diversion of the money -required to build
wagon roads at the expense of the Federal treasury.
Some of the minority in both houses followed him list
lessly. He made the issue at the moment when the death
of William C. Whitney led to a review of his illustrious
career, and brought out his capital service in re-creating
the navy. Still Mr. Gorman persisted until he is prac
tically isolated and his leadership is without vitality.
Senator Patterson of Colorado, who sought to secure
amendments to the naval appropriation bill, took care to
say that he believed in the development of the navy until
it was ahead of Germany and Russia, and next to Gfeat
Britain in fighting tonnage and offensive power. He de
clared that public sentiment would not in the future per
mit the navy to again fall behind that of any nation it
had passed. That is undoubtedly a correct reading of
public opinion, and. is another way of saying that Sena
tor Gorman is not in accord with that opinion, and his
party will not follow him. ' ' Â¦ .
A review of the political situation as it is seems to
confirm jhe statement that a powerful element in the De
mocracy is seeking enlightenment upon the sentiment of
the people, only to discover that when they find what it
is, and try to follow it, they are led. directly toward the
Republican party. : This was the case in the Panama mat
ter and is true of the naval appropriation. Of course,
â¢from a partisan standpoint this is very disagreeable to
the minority, but it proves that the Republican party re
mains'the exponent of the hopes, aspirations and policies
of the people. No change is in sight, nor will there be
any until entirely new issues arise that run into both par
lies and either divide them, or destroy the weaker one to
build a new organization out of its fragments, as the Re
publican party was built on the ruins of Whiggery by
the hands of Democrats who followed Sumnef, Wilmot
and Giddings.,1, , - u < Â¦ â¢

I have chosen the above form of the
male tirst in; preference to those that
come after, because it is "the easiest
to sing. The' scale â¢ seems to run of
itself in this exercise, and. if the pu
pi keeps his mind upon what he is
doing- there Is little chance of his go
ing wrons; in any way. Â« ,
The "inverted phrase" idea (men
tioned in a former lesson) can be car
ried out to good advantage in this ex
ercise, particularly in descending the
scale, for the pupil's impulse will be
to let the notes run away from him
when they once begin the descent. The
."imaginary Inversion," however, giv
ing the idea that each note is* leading
upward, while in reality it is leading
down, will act as an excellent steadier.
In Â¦ practicing the pupil should ,- go
rtirht'-frora one key to . another; only,
stopping long enough to take breath at
Â«Â»ach change of key. In . descending"
the same rule should be observed. At
As- soon as the boy. has mastered
the exercise in the key of C he must
take it a half tone, higher, and as he
succeeds on each key in turn let him
raise the exercise, until the limit of
his voice is reachedâ that is. until he
has carried the exercise as 1 high as his
voice can easily go. Remember that
the voice must never be et: ..ined. The
child will not be expected to do any
pyrotechnics for years, and our aim
is to preserve the voice, not to maim
it for life. These exercises are de
signed Kim ply to teach the boy how
to manage- his voice when singing
unpretentious little song3 and to di
rect the ero'.\*th of his voice' along the
right channel, that is all.
As soon as the student has succeed
ed in singing the exercise as it should
be, according to the instrrctions al
ready given, he must accent only
on the first and eighth notes of
the group â -in other words, on middle
C and on D (above third space). The
impetus given him from the accent on
O must be enough to swing him up the
scale to the upper D. and. the accent
on D must be strong enough to send
him easily down to C again. /.âÂ«..â¢-*
The pupil must sing the whole exer
t ze with one Breath, being careful to
make each note round and perfect in
Jtself. yet letting the tones run
Kmoothly - freely, relying on the ac
cent. "'â¢ * â¢ ; * " Â¦
This is the longest exercise we have
yet given the pupil, and for that reason
he must be Very ' careful about the:
l.rexth. He must be careful to take
Just as much breath as be really needs,
end no more, for the exercise must go
on with no appreciable pause to the
end, and with no difference whatever
in tone. He must try to breathe as un
ostentatiously as possible, and it will
help him do this if he remembers for a
moment that he is breathing every mo
ment of his life, and that when not
tinging he never thinks of regarding*
breathing as labor or as anything ne
cessitating time. The breath comes and
goes of itself, and there is always
enough provided for our ordinary needs.
It will be so, too, in singing as soon as.
brain and body become used to the new
form of exercise. The pupil should re
alize this, and remember that overexer
tion is just as bad as underexertion,
whether in the matter of too much"
breath or anything else. >
Our next exercise is to be a regular
scale form. The pupil must start on
C (middle C) and continue straight
up the scale until he has compassed
en octave. Then, striking D. he sings
the descending scale, coming back to
middle C as the final note. The accent
Is most important in this exercise, as
it is in all forms of the scale. The first
note of each group of four is to be ac
cented, .and the final note. A, is to be
held. ,V
The accent should be carefully fol
lowed in this exercise, as on this liter
ally hangs the success of the whole ex
ercise. I say "hangs," because each
Group of four notes swings in the air
from the force of the accent given the
first note.
The pupil should begin singing on
middle C. taking next D, E and C again,
making the first group of four. .Next
tome D, E. F, D. then E. F, G, E, then
F, O, A, F. and so on gradually up the
scale until C (on the third space) is
reached. After .this the exercise begins
to descend, but In a different way. It
ttarts on E (fourth space), followed by
D. C, then E once more. After this D.
C, B, D, the** C, B. A, C. and so on
until the pupil at last finds his way
back to middle C
After the student has l.ecome familiar
with the triplet exercise in all keys
virhin his easy reach he must take an
other exercise, which I will now ex
plain. It is in groups of four notes, the
first note of which is to be accented.
1 do not advise starting other exer
cises as low as A. but the one in ques
tion runs fo high that the low notes
ere an advantage rather than a disad
vantage.
Before taking up anything new the
exercise in triplets given in the former
3 r -FEon must be practiced in other keys.
The pupil may occasionally start this
exercise as low as A (the A below mid
die C). unless by so doing his tones
lose quality. We do not wish to have
anything to do with so-called "chest
tones" at present, for when the "head
tones " are thoroughly placed the chest
tonf-s ttill come naturally, and th<i
abrupt change from head to ch'est be
avoided.

Scale Exercises.
Next, when singing the second line,
he â¢ should keep the remembrance of
the high note in his mind, although
the notes all go down the scale, to fin
ish out "the phrase. After this let him
eing the two lines first with the words,
and then without, several times, .until
he can sing the phrase in conjunction
with the words with perfection.
Before leaving this branch of the sub
ject I wish to say, a word or two more
about the pupil's enjoyment of the
"thinking high" method. I hope you
quite understand -how .he is to apply
it to song rendering. Take, for in
stance, the first line of the hymn men
tioned aboveâ "There is a Happy
Land." Land is on the highest note
in this part of the tune; therefore he
must think of that note, as. he starts
singing the line. In this way he will
unconsciously lift and hold the voice
aloft, so to speak, so that- when he
finally reaches the '.higher note he will
take it as easily as if it were no higher"
than the first one. I have dwelt upon
this at considerable length before, but
it is one thing tb.be able to apply the
rule to exercises and another to apply
it to u song, while paying attention to
the words as . well. If the pupil has
any difficulty in doing this let him
sing the music without the words a
few times until he is able to keep, the
voice on the high plane that he should.
Be careful that he does not, the mo
ment he finds himself on familiar
ground (that is, singing something that
he knows), lapse back into all his for
mer careless and unintelligent ways of
singing. Insist that he observe all the
rules of breathing, tone placing, and
so fcrrth, here, Just as he does the ex
ercises. â¢ â¢
It will be a good thing to have him
try an exercise pr two first, always be
fore beginning his song practice- This
will put voice and mind in a properly
receptive state.
In singing this hymn (or a kinder
garten song, as the case may be) he
must, as soon as he learns the actual
notes, think ahead toward the higher
notes always, in order to keep his voice
from falling or â¢ becoming heavy. In
saying this I am speaking only* of the
children who are inclined to wander
from the key when not under guidance.
There are children, I am happy, to say.
who sing perfectly in tune always.
Whether or no the child clings nat
urally In tune, however, he should al
ways be taught to listen to his own
tones while practicing; whether in the
case of song or exercise. In fact, the
song must be regarded as an exercise
until the boy knows Just exactly how
to Ring it. Â¦;.;;Â¦
When the child has learned two lines
of this he has learned four. When he
has mastered the fifth and sixth lines,
he has learned the whole tune, for the
last line is Just like -the second and
fourth lines. ;1^ -
This is known to us all and, while
there is much repetition in it, it is
sweet from start to finish and the mel
ody is one that children love always.
Play the song over to the child a
few times, singing the voice part your
self. Then let him try it with you
once or twice, as a whole. Then read
the words to him,- so that he may
gather the full meaning of the song. - ;
Now take the first phrase and, let
ting hint try -it, alone, see what he is
able to make of it.
For this first song study be sure to
pick out something that is very simple
in construction and something that has
considerable repetition in it if possible.
Take, for instance, that sweet, familiar
little hymn:
There Is a Happy Land,
>*Â«r. far away:
Where saints In glory -stand.
Bright, bright as day.
There is nothing prettier to be found
In the way of children's songs, I think,
than those in the kindergarten collec
tions, which can be purchased at any
reliable music store. These songs are
purposely written within the compass
of the ordinary child's voice and the
words as'a rule are admirably suited
to the child's understanding.
Now, taking the ground that the
pupil has reached the point where he
breathes naturally and well, starts the
tone In the right place without having
to be told and knows how to manage
the tone according to our simple rules
when once it is actually out, he- is
ready to learn a little song.
The next scale exercise is very like
the one already priven, except that it
does not carry the voice to upper D.
It runs up the octave, as did the first
exercise, but uses B (next below third
space) for the top note of the descend
ing scale, and goes down to the B be
low middle C before finally ending on
middle C. It is considerably harder
to sing this exercise well than the one
before it, for the latter scale is not
quite so conducive to free action as is
the first one. It is, however,Â»a valu
able exercise, and one that should be
practiced as much as the first, in spite
of the fact that the pupil must watch
or rather listen to every note with re
doubled care. Let him call in the aid
of the "inverted -phrase" as much as
possible, for he will need it here, even
more than in the last exercise.
â¢ Now we will take one more exercise,
after which we will be through with
scales. In this the student must start
on C as usual, but must hold it one
beat, thus making a quarter note of
it. By this means the ascending meas
ure ends on B, while C (third space)
starts the descending scale.
It will be well for the student to
change from one to another â for in
stance, practice the first scale exer
cise on one day, the second on the
next and the third on the next, after
which he should begin on the first
again, and so on. It would not be well
for him to practice all three exercises
in one day. in conjunction with the
other exercises I have given. In the
first place there would not be time, for
in order to practice them all he would
be obliged to slight some of the exer
cises, which would/ of course, defeat
at the outset the end he has in view.
each beginning, each change of key.
ihe pupil's voice should be perfectly
fresh and flexible. If It Is not so he
laay be sure that something: is wrong:
either in his way of taking the note or
!n his manner of finishing the note just
sung.

Grunsky declined to make public any
of the details of the reports- until .they
are formally filed with the Board of
Public Works to-day. The report on
the Santa Fe franchise is similar in
tenor to theone on the Southern "Pacific
franchise recently granted so far as
the construction work is concerned.
The City Engineer favors the con
struction of a central salt water sys
tem, with intermediate stations for the
pumping of the fluid, which Is to be
used not only to extinguish fires, but
also to sprinkle the stre'ets and flush
the sewers.
The most important work outlined by
the City Engineer includes the . con
struction of an extension of the Sixth
street sewer from Tehama to Brannan
street at an estimated cost of -555,000.
Another proposed important improve
ment is the construction of a bitumin
ous rock pavement along H street from
First to .Twentieth avenue, and the
macadamizing of the street from Twen
tieth avenue to the Great Highway at
a total estimated cost of $80,300, to
gether with the construction, of artifi
cial stone sidewalks from Stanyan
street to Eleventh avenue at an addi
tional cost of $26,175.
The report also provides for the con
struction of a sewer at. Buena Vista
avenue, and thoroughfares fronting on
Lobos and other public squares,
i City Engineer Grunsky yesterday
completed two reports on plans for an
auxiliary municipal salt water system
to insure better fire protection and on
the petition of the Santa Fe Railway
system for a franchise to maintain a
steam road along Indiana, Mariposa,
Seventh, Sixteenth and other streets.
The reports will be filed with the Board
of Pul/llc Works for transmlttal to the
Board of Supervisors.
The report on the Santa Fe franchise
was delayed, as Grunsky desired to as
certain if anvthing definite would- be
done in the matter of the proposed
widening of Sixteenth street to the
water front. The Southern Pacific Com
pany agreed to donate land for a dis
tance of several blocks to increase the
width of the thoroughfare, but no steps
have so far b-*n taken to widen the re
mainder of the thoroughfare.
The City Engineer decided that he
would wait no longer, as he wished to
file his two final reports on the fran
chise application and the salt water
system before he retired from office,' his
resignation being now In the hands of
the Board of Public Works," Grunsky
having asked that it take effect yester
day.
City Engineer Grunsky yesterday
filed a report with the Board of Public
Works in which he recommends that
the city expend the sum of $378,810 on
street and sewer work during the next
fiscal year. The segregated items of the
recommendation follow:
Construction of sewers, ?G7,"Â« r Â»0: work in

After over two and a half hours'
discussion Allen's amendment was de
feated and the agreement was draft
ed. The semi-annual accounts were
passed, but not without criticism of
the increased expenditures," which the
president said were justified on ac
count of the larger traffic, severe
weather and higher prices.
The president, in reply to cries of
"adjourn," explained that the Cana
dian Parliament, at its meeting on
March 10, must have an answer one
way or the other. Vice President
Smlthers attributed some of the crit
icism to rival railroads.
Sir Charles Rivera Wil3on, presi
dent'of the company, said the new
line was justified by the -flow of'pop
ulation from East to West and the
increasing immigration into the Unit
ed States. The Grand Trunk could
not hope to receive such generous
treatment from the Canadian Govern
ment as the. Canadian Pacific Rail
way, but the Premier, Sir Wilfrid
Laurler, had acted absolutely fairly,
in spite of violent political opposition,
with the object of attaining addition
al facilities for the development of
Canada. The president characterized
the deposit demanded by the Cana
dian Government in conection with
the agreement as an "extremely un
necessary and unreasonable demand."
Then, one after another, sharehold
ers representing blocks of 50,000 and
more shares rose and declared they
had not had sufficient time to consid
er such a huge enterprise.
An amendment was proposed by
George Allen, who had resigned his
seat irr the directorate # on account of
the matter under discussion, in which
he declared the intended action would
ruin the Grand Trunk Railroad.
Several large shareholders with
drew their proxies and placed them
in the hands of the directors.
LONDON, March. 8. â The Grand
Trunk Railroad shareholders at :* a
meeting to-day ratified* the agreement
with the Canad'an Government for
the construction of a Grand Trunk
line to the Pacific Coast. The decision
was reached only after a prolonged
discussion. The meeting was packed
and at one stage of the proceedings
the tone was unmistakably hostile to
embarking on so huge an enterprise.
General Manager Hays, who had
come from Canada especially to at
tend the meeting, saved the situation
and when the final vote was taken
there were only, a few opponents to
the Grand Trunk Railroad undertak
ing to build a transcontinental road.

Xhtn there are days when the sur
face of this Waimangu crater, which
<-overs close to. an acre, takes on a
suise of misleading placidity and is so
free from motion or steam that a pass
ing observer might well scoff at the
Â°<'ft-told tales^of its uncanny vagaries.
These peculiar phases generally pre
cede terms of great, and it must be
admitted normal, violence, when the
monster explodes with a terrific noise
and . to heights as great as 2009 feet
belches aloft black water, mud and
stones, sometimes directly perpendicu

The new geyser is not only a near
reighbor, but a dirtinet prototype of
the srrand Waimangu, which only a
fc-w months ago was the scene of a
distressing tragedy.
Two girls nged 19 and 20 years,
cood looking, happy and gifted with
c^n^rous wealth, were with their
mother visitors to Waimangu. They
had traveled through a considerable
section of the thermal belt, had been
i">ved in Maori-manned boats across
' he boiling lake of Ilotomahana and
had traversed devastated Tarawera,
wearing on its desolate face the awful
ravages of the disastrous eruption in
l^se. Kxcited by all they had seen,
fascinated and reckless by the ease and
apparent safety of all excursions, they
disregarded the advice of their guid-s

"DOETH GOOD"
And Addctli No Sorrow.
"I f>m an old lady and had used cof-
fee all my life until a year ago, then I
found a drink 'that doeth good and
addeth no sorrow.'
'"For many years I had been
troubled with constipation and stom-
ach trouble, sleeplessness and various
othÂ«Â»r ills. and. although I had been
constantly treated, I got almost no re-
lief.
"I have always been a great worker,
with many cares, and often in the
morning: I would feel unequal to my
daily tasks. J?o I would drink a good,
stiff cup of coffee, of which I was very
fond, and then for two or three hours
afterward I would fee! so smart and
buoyant and keyed up to such a high
note that I could undertake most any-
thing. But along about 11 o'clock the
reaction would begin and leave me
stranded on a lounge until dinner time.
Then I would get a cup of tea to tide
me over the afternoon. So it went on
for a number of years and the great
â¢vonder is that I did not collapse alto-
fr^ther. I mu*t have' had a good con-
stitution. Every month I got a little
worse.
"At last and with great reluctance I
was forced to the conclusion . that it
was coffee that waa the chief cause of
my many troubles. So I looked the
matter up carefully, quit the coffee
and began the use of delicious Pos-
tum; the wisdom of this change was
soon shown in a material improvement
in my health.
"Since I have been using Postum I
do not have that unnatural elation and
f onsequent reaction and the craving
for the stimulant has left me, I am
now strong and steady all of the time.

The management of the races re
quests that all ponies which have not
been officially measured be taken to F.
J. Cardan's Crossways farm to-morrow
at . 11 o'clock, where the club official
.will certify as to their size. The . only
qualification required to start a pony
in the races is that it be not higher
than fourteen and a half hands and
that it be ridden, by a qualified gentle
man, rider. No entrance fee is exacted
and membership in the association ia
not required.
The Burlingame poloists who will
play in the international match on Sun
day are : 'Â¦:. R. M. Â¦ Tobin, W. S. Hobart,

The officials of the California Polo
and Pony Racing Association anticipate
exciting sport at their forthcoming
meeting at Tanforan racecourse on Sat
urday and Monday. The entries for
the various races will close to-day with
Secretary Robert Leighton at 327 Mar
ket street. From the advance entry it
is apparent there will be some close
contests. Dr. E. J. Boeseke of Santa
Barbara has entered a number of new
ponies which have never started here.
Owing to the illness of Lawrence Mc-
Creery, who was fifteen pounds a bet
ter rider than any one seen in the sad
dle, recently at Del Monte, Walter Ho
bart will have to find a new rider for
his champion quarter horse, Silver Dick.
This will give the short distance races
a decidedly open look, especially as the
condition. of some of the horses has im
proved noticeably.
President Thomas H. Williams, who
has given material evidence of j his in
terest.in pony racing, has kindly con
sented to act as presiding judge. The
stewards of the meeting will be F. J.
Mackey, Charles Butters and Charles
Raoul-Duval. /r-V /

LOS ANGELES, March 8.â Two out
of six favorites won at Ascot to-day,
the other races going to liberal priced
second and third choices. Belle Kinney
beat Barney Schreiber's good colt Pin
kerton in the two-year-old race in
handy fashion and ' thereby dealt the
talent a severe blow. Pinkerton was
well backed by the heavy bettors, while
Kinney was the choice of the public.
.Kinny led all the way and won by two
lengths, with Sea Air third.
Magic Flute took the first race, at
five furlongs. Negruscate was second
and the favorite, . Foncasta, third.
I Criss-Cross was a heavy favorite for
the third number, and won- easily from
Wager. James J. Corbett was third. ',
The fourth was a big success for the
talent. Bragg was played from the
opening to the close and won all the
way. Nitrate, the second choice, sulked
and was pulled up. Greenock finished
second, with John * McGurk a good
third.
Nervator was beaten a length in the
fifth race by Jim Hale. E. M. Brattain
being third. Hale was a strong second
choice in the betting.
In the last race on the card, at -one
mile, Buccleuth was a redhot favorite,
but wheeled as the barrier was sprung
and was left. Silver Fi?z won by a neck
from Ultruda. with J. V. Kirby third.
This race was "a big clean-up for the

II. B. Hansen Is Arrested for . Vag
rancy After Sensational Attempt
to Escape.
H. B. . Hansen Â¦ was arrested last
night by Patrolmen Stelzner and Mo
gan and booked at the City Prison on
a charge of vagrancy. James Brady,
watchman at the uncompleted Fair
mont Hotel on Nob HiU, noticed him
prowling about the building 1 near mid
night. Believing he was bent upon
stealing tools, Brady approached the
fellow and ordered him from the
premises. Instead of complying Han
sen made a lunge with an ugly look
ing knife in an attempt to disembowel
Brady and 'the latter hit his assailant
on the head With a rock.
The police were summoned, but
were at first unable to find Hanaen.
Stelzner and Mogan finally located
him hiding on the Sacramento-street
side of the building. Upon the ap
proach of the officers he jumped from
the bulkhead, landing on the should
ers of a passing pedestrian,. thirty feet
below. Hansen was treated at' the
Harbor Hospital for a badly sprained
ankle and then locked up.

ENTRIES FOR TO-DAY.
Jockey Henry Spencer leaves for
Memphis some time within the next
fortnight, where he will do some rid
ing for Tichenor &^ Co., when the meet
ing opens there.
Puerl Wilkerson, owner of Warte
Xicht and other horses, wired from Los
Angeles last j night, asking that six
stalls be reserved for his stable.
Box Elder, winner of the first race,
was bid up from $400 to $900 by J. J.
Mora n and secured. The gelding was
entered by the Hamilton stable.
' C. Smith piloted two winners, and if
he will let his whip alone and - resort
to hand riding alone will make a good
rider.
Garnet Ferguson has secured a one
year contract on the services of Char
ley Connell.
Ed Stutte, a big bettor who made
many friends while here, departed for
Los Angeles on last night's Owl train.
Jockey Tommy Burns and wife left
for the East Sunday evening." Tommy
will be seen in the saddle at the Ben
nings meeting.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Zenonian, Sir Appleby and Foxy
Grandpa each took a turn at showing
in the lead, but all lacked the stamina
to stay. Travers on the favorite took
the lead turning into the stretch, and
at the stand won handily from Dell
Fountain's Salto. Foxy Grandpa ran
third, two lengths before Sir Appleby.
Henry Spencer, "the ice man," and
his friends did not thaw out for forty
minutes after the mile and a sixteenth
selling number. Henry rode Possart,
and the black horse carried some ex
tensive commissions at 2 to 1. Spencer
was told not to let Fille d'Or, the mount
of C. Smith, get too far in the lead, but
he couldn't help himself. Smith made a
sneak at the start and the mare won
all the way. Spencer picked out the
best going with Possart and was then
beaten four open lengths. Boutonniere
for a time looked dangerous, though
eventually losing the show to Mr. Din
gle. Prince Blazes and Polonlus, two
heavily played ones, were left at the
post.
"Doc" Kyle's Keynote made it three
straight by taking the final mile and a
sixteenth selling affair. Ridden by C.
Smith and a A to 5 favorite, the gelding
early assumed the lead and won easily
after a little shaking up from Axmin
ster. Byronerdale ran a distant third.
After seeing Jack Little meet with
defeat in the opening sprint, it only
goes to show that bad horses are poor
betting propositions at any price.
Jack looked In an easy spot and with
J. Daly on his back closed favorite
at 13 to 5. At the start J. T. Sheehan
on Box Elder shot away in front and
although tiring perceptibly at the
close, led fhe favorite out a length.
The winner was second choice in the
ring. Hogarth finished third. Hol
brook could do nothing with Re
signed. .
After all there is one thing to be
said in favor of Bell â he is consist
ent. Some ridere w-ill ride Â« five win-,
ners to-day and get beaten on six
favorites the. day following. That sort
of thing is unfathomable and should
always be passed up to the man wear
ing the 8li hat. But with Bell it is
different. Every time he goes to the
post on a Wrse something happens
to draw out some adverse criticism on
his ability. In the two-year-old
scramble Bell had the leg up on
Edpecliff and when all* of the other
starters had left the barrier then fol
lowed Bell. He finished a close third.
The winner turned- up in Bob Ragon,
played down to 13 -to 5 favoritism,
*^hich Jack Martin landed a head In
front of Bill Short at the wire.
The Hawaiian may not have been
best of those starting in the Futurity
course, third to be decided, but Trav
ers gave him a vigorous ride and that
helped a good deal. The Figaro sta
ble entry opened favorite at 2 . to 1,
but, as Salto, Foxy Grandpa, Sir Ap
pleby and Zenonian were all support
ed, the price lengthened to 18 to 5.
THE HAWAIIAN WINS.
The six and a half furlonjc handicap
run at Oakland yesterday was one
of the most' peculiar betting races of
the season: A glance - at the odds
would indicate that each and every
starter had undergone the canning
process, but such was not the case.
There were half a dozen starters,
and after a nervous and fidgety betting
session Kenilworth, the top weight,
with Willie See up, went to the post
favorite, although the price about
the brown horse had receded from 2 %
to 1 to 14 to 3. He 'played a' limited
engagement out in front, side stepped
into second position and finally finish
ed third. ' In the run to the wire Oli
phant, moving up on the extreme out
side, collared Nigrette.-beating out the
Jennings entry nearly a length.
Sidney Bender's mudlark closed at 7
after opening at 4%: Soufriere came
in for considerable backing and . fin
ished absolutely last, after showing a
spark of speed.
Three favorites gathered purses,
which is a fair showing when the
heavy condition of the track is taken
into consideration. The attendance
was .good and betting brisk.
BOX ELDER IX FRONT.
The opening number saw Mike Mar
tin, a lanky youth from Philadelphia,
knocked out after a couple of minutes
of fighting by stocky Patsy Hogan^of
Chicago.
Truscott took a lot of heavy body
nnd suomach punches. The pair gave
a cleair exhibition.
The spectators were given a lively
ten-round number between L5*n Trus
cott. who. Billy Jordan said, was the
â¢light-weight champion of Australia,"
and Fred Landers, the North Beach
boy. Referee Eddie Smith called it a
draw, which was a satisfactory deci
sion. Landers knows the game bet
ter than the lad from the Antipodes,
but Truscott showed with a good left
th;Â«t t'red the San Francisco young
ster at times.
In the fifth round Woods decided
it was time to close the evening's
sport, so he drove in three terrific
gnashes on Kelly's jaw. Down went
the alleged "cyclone" thrice, and his
seconds threw up the sponge. In the
first round "Cyclone" went to the floor
seven times and was pounded to the
ropes twice. Kelly made not the
slightest pretense to fight. It was
ridiculously "raw." and more "raw"in
the second. In the third Kelly went to
the floor once. Woods did not do a bit
of flghting in the fourth, and the pair
managed to stand off the hooting and
yelling for this round. Then the fifth
and last came.
Why Woods did not end the contest
in the* first round only "Biddy" Bishop,
his manager, and the colored man
know. There was no excuse for keep
ing the crowd through the following
rounds, because Kelly did not even
make the semblance of a showing. The
Sequoia Club is suffering under the
repetition of suspicious contests that
have been given under its manage
ment since boxing was resumed in
* Oakland. The Kelly-Woods event is
' the third in puccossion that has not
had a thoroughly genuine appearance.
Given the benefit of all doubts to date,
Manager Bishop should not permit
another such mill as that of last night.
OAKLAND. March 8.â "Cyclone"
Kelly, the boxer, is misnamed. He is
only a soft and gentle summer zephyr.
Billy Woods took five rounds to-night
at the Sequoia Club to finish Kelly,
but the dark-skinned fighter could
have done the trick in any part of the
first round had he been so minded.
It miRht be diflicult to prove that the
bout was the rankest kind of a "fake,"
but it was palpably evident to the
spectators, many of them experts in
the same, that it was a farcical hip
podrome from Kelly's corner, any*
way.

Supervisors' ' Finance Committee
Averse to Expending $5000 Pre
liminary to Litigation.
The Supervisors' Finance Commlt
-tee met yesterday for the purpose of
devising a plan for the collection of
collateral inheritance taxes on estates.
The sum of more than $200,000 re r
mains due and unpaid, and it is
planned to have this money turned
into the State treasury.
County Clerk Greif stated that he
would co-operate with the City Treas
urer in keeping up the quarterly re
ports of. probable amounts due In
taxes from estates of decedents. Greif
stated that it would cost at least
$3000 to take off the names of estates
owing inheritance taxes. Then it
would be necessary to bring many
suits against the executors and heirs
and this might be futile In cases
where the estates had already been
distributed.
The members of the committee, Su
pervisors D'Ancona and Payot, did not
feel Justified in recommending that the
city expend the money for something
which benefits the State alone. Payot
thought the State should- stand the
expense, but D'Ancona informed him
that the duty of collecting the taxes
devolved on the County Clerk. Fur
ther consideration of the matter was
postponed... ; , .
Commend His Courageous Conduct in
Risking His Life to Assist in
Capture of Burglars.
At a meeting of the Police Commis
sioners last evening a resolution was
adopted commending John D. O'Brien,'
a Call reporter,, for his cool and cour
ageous conduct several nights ago,
when he risked his own life and was
wounded in assisting Policemen D. J.
Keohane* and J. B. O'Connor in the
capture of two burglars.
Antonio Blanco appeared before the
board with an application for a re
newal of his license for the Poodle
Dog restaurant. Action in, the mat
ter was 'deferred until next week's
meeting. Commissioner Hutton de
n6unced the manner in which the
Poodle Dog is conducted. He said
that the place is a disgrace to San
Francisco and he gave notice that he
purposed to not only vote against the
renewal of that restaurant's license,
but all other French restaurants that
are conducted in a similar manner.

positively ev.-car I had no pistol and fired no
shot that night.
WHY JIE "RAN AWAY.
"Did you make any resistance to
the men that attacked you' at the
door?" was asked by the Coroner.
"No; I just tried to get away as
quickly as possible."
"Why did you*, not remain and pro
tect your father?" said a juror.
, "Because he had said he never
would oppose a hold-up. He always
told me it was dangerous business
resisting footpads. I ran, back into
the engine-room, thinking he would
follow me."

Daniel Mason, more generally called
"Sam," the negro workman, that was
formerly employed at the * packing
house, began his testimony by fully
airing his grievances against* Albert
Buttgenbach. He said:
Mr. Al had me thrown out. He treated me
like a dog. I did all kinds of work, but he al
ways abused me, and once he tried to break
my head with a hammer, but his father came
between us and saved me. I stayed there Just
to please the boss. Finally the boss came and
shut down. I then put on my coat, got my
overcoat out of the closet and started for th'u
Btreet, going through the heavy Iron doors
to the store In front. Ak soon as I opened
the Shipley street doo'r two men confronted
me. one of them sticking a revolver In my
face, while the other gave me a light rap on
the head. Both men had white handkerchiefs
over the lower part of their faces.
One said to me. "Kee? quiet, kid." 1 ran
back through the office, telling father and
Brune there was a hold-up and going on into
the engine-room. I do not remember whether
the two men knocked off my hat at the door
or not. I gannct recall whether they followed
me very closely. 1 was out in the engine
room when I heard the noi3e of the shattered
glass. I heard no ?*ot.
I a.=J*Â»d for my hat when they were taking
me away to the police station. No. I do not
know whether it was on my head when I start
ed first to leave tho shop.
This man Bam Mason, who Is quoted as say
ing he taw me with a revolver on Saturday
night. Is the fellow I had discharged for drunk
ennets and neglect of work. He turned down
a valve on the condenser. I believed he did it
maliciously to hurt me. I did not get on well
with him. As to his statement, 1 want to say
that I never had a revolver In my life, and had
none on Saturday night. I saw none except
those of tho two men at the door. Neither
father nor I nor Brune ever had a revolver at
the factory. Father had one at the house,
which he kept locked up. I have not seen it
for a year.
When I came back from the saloon I saw no
one on Shipley street. 1 know nothing what-

en under police guard to attend the
funeral of his father to-day.
The ex-Convicts, Edward Gonzales
and John Riley, who were arrested
Sunday on suspicion, were discharged
last evening, the police having failed
to discover any evidence to connect
them with the murder of Buttgen
bach. "^
This ended the testimony for the
day and the inquest was adjourned
until Thursday morning, in order to
MASONS CONTRADICTIONS.
This statement was a backdown
from what the witness had been tell
ing the police and the Coroner pressed
him on his inconsistency. %
"Did you not tell the detectives
that you knew it was a rev#lver?" he
asked.
"Xo," said the colored man, trying
to evade the question/ "I am telling
the truth now, and positively I cannot
say that it was a revolver." This was
all the Coroner could get out of him.
Stephen Slavich, a boy of 16, told
a clear and effective story., of the trag
edy as seen and heard from the side
walk In front of the packing-house.
He said:
1 was going up Fourth street when I heard a
shot fired and sdme glass falling. Immedi
ately there was a loud groan, as of some one
saying "Oh-h-h 1 ." Then I heard sounds of
people trampling on broken glass and of a
scuffle. I ran up the street to a store Just
above Shipley street and told a man standing
there that some one was shot. I came back,
then to Heide's saloon. ' where a crowd was
collecting. I am sure the glass Tell Just after
the shot was tired and not before. 1 saw no
one in Shipley street until the police and crowd
gathered. If there wn* any onÂ© there I think
I might have seen him, but am not sure.
sai3 r would better leave, as he did not want
trouble with the bey. Â¦ â¢ - - .
Late Saturdays night I "was- standing ont on
the sidewalk In front of Heide's saloon, when
Mr. AI. went in there and got a drink. I
watched him from the dodr, which was open.
AVhen he came out and went back to Shipley
street, Just as he was turning the corner I saw
him take something out of his right front
pocket and pass it around to his back left
pocket. . It shone In the light from the street
lamp, but I cannot say whether It was a re
volver or a wrench.
After four days' investigation by
half a dozen detectives and at the
completion ofthe first day of the in
quest, Captain of Detectives Martin
still believes that Joseph Buttgenbach
came to his death from a bullet fired
from a revolver in the hands of Albert
Buttgenbach, son of- the murdered
man. The police, although not In pos
session of direct evidence to estab
lish their theory, intimate that at least
two witnesses will be found to
strengthen, the web they are attempt
ing to weave around Albert Buttgen
bach.
To a representative of The Call last
night Martin, for the first
time since the mysterious murder,
consented to expound his theory of
the- crime. Although his statement In
several instances is at variance with
the- testimony given at the Coroner's
inquest yesterday, he does not hesi
tate to say that whoever fired the
fatal shot did so with malice and de
liberateness.

questions asked by the Coroner and
Jurors in a manner that made an im
pression on his hearers. He said:
BItUXE TELLS OF HOLD-UP.
Joseph Buttgenbach and I were counting the
cash last Saturday night when his son Albert
rushed through the office shouting. "It's a
case of hold-uo." Albert ran out at once
through the rear office door Into the engine
room.
I waited just a second before'- I followed
him. In that time I saw Mr. Buttgenbaoh
turn awav from the fciesk in the back office,
' where he had been standing by my side, and
face about toward the front office door as if
to meet the footiiads. As I was quitting the
office J heard him scuffling. with some one. but I
I could not see the face or figure - of that
person. While running back into the engine
room I continued to hÂ«ar the noise of the
scuffle. Then came the sound of the breaking
glass. This I remember distinctly, but do not
recall hearing the ristol shot. !
I ran back to the stairway and called through
the partition to the barkeeper In the saloon
for h*lr>. Albert oame over to the stairs and
I toM him to kick in the partition. He did
this and wae at once taken care of by the
officer*. I stuck my head through the open- |
Ing and asked for help. Sergeant Greene '
came through and with him I went back into
the office, where we found Mr. Buttgenbach.
lying in a pool of his own blood. I tried to
get him to talk, but he never spoke again.
This was p.bout 10:15 p. m.-
We generally close the building about 9:30,
after which there is always some work to do
before we go home.. So far as I know there
waÂ«> no one In the building- except thÂ« two
Buttgenbachs and myself at the time we were
counting the cash. :
I paid the men off before 10 o'clock. Al
bert's balance was $12. After I gave him this
I did not see him ag-aln until he came Into
the office shouting "Hold up!" As soon as
his father heard this shout he dropped his
purse ana Fterted for the front office .door
and I ran out the back door.
SAW XO ASSAILANT.
"Did you see any one scuffling with
Joseph Buttgenbach?" asked Leland.
"No, but I heard the noise of the
scuffling and of the falling glass. Just
as soon as I got out in the engine
room Albert . called to me there in the
dark and told me to shout for help. I
ran over to the stairway, because at
first it occurred to me that "I might go
upstairs and hide. My suggestion that
Albert break the partition was due to
my familiarity with the building. I
knew the boards were thin. I was
afraid to go out by the Shipley street
door, because I didn't want to run Into
the footpads."
"Did Albert have a -hat on when he
ran through the office giving the
alarm?"
"I do not recall what he wore, except
that he was in his street clothes."
"Was any one following him?"
"I am almost positive that I heard
the sound of footsteps behind him, but
I did not stay to get a look at his pur
suer. No. I did not hear the scuffle he
says took place at the Shipley street
door. I was so busy making up the
cash that the noise would have had to
be very loud for me to notice it. There
was a single gas jet lit in the store out
side the office, but as we were back at
the desk w r e did not see any figures
passing before the window."
Brune's testimony closed with the as
sertion that he knew of no serious trou
ble between the Buttgenbachs, father
and son, and that in all the years he
had known Albert he had never known
him to own or carry a revolver.
ALBERT'S EXPLANATION*.
Albert L. Buttgenbach, whom the po
lice believe killed his father, showed
the marks of nervous strain when he
took the stand. Evidently the two days
in the City Prison had worn on him. He
was scared, weak- voiced and very un
comfortable under the ordeal of the
Coroner's examination- .But' the story
he told the police Saturday night when
"he was first arrested was repeated
without material .variance/. Suspicious
as his explanatjon is, the young fellow's
steadiness under fire grew as he became
familiar with his inquisitors, and he
battled for his own version of. the trag
edy with a stubbornness ttiat at least
won him credit for nerve. His story
follows:
I am an engineer, and for two years past
have been employed .by ray father, receiving
$18 a week. Last week I drew $6. In ad
vance, eo there was. only $12 due me when
Brune paid oft the men. I never had anything
but' kindly feelings toward my father. . No
trouble occurred- between us.-
After Brtine gave, me the money Saturday
night I went out to Alpers 4 Heide's Â«Uoon
and rot a drink of whisky, then came back
to the boiler-room and looked at the flres and
changed my clothes. Shortly before 10 o'clock
I cot things about the engine la order and
"I believe." said Captain Martin,
"that Joseph Buttgenbach was not
shot durfng a struggle, but while en
tirely oblivious of his danger and at
work over the desk in" the front of
fice. The location of the hole in the
hat, the wound on the tight side of
the head and the course taken by the
bullet seem to bear out that theory.
It is true that we have not been able
up to the present time to secure evi
dence that insures a conviction of any
body, yet Detective Ryan is out look
ing for a couple of witnesses that may
be able to throw some light on the
affair. It is evident that the person
that held the pistol rested his hand
against the iron column which forma
part of the scale, so as to steady hia
aim, and then pulled the trigger. The
bullet struck Buttgenbach on the
right side of the head, near the top.
It does not appear probable that ths
shot was fired during a struggle, as
would be inferred from the testimony
given before the Coroner, but by some
one bent upon murder and aiming at
an object and that object Buttgen
bach's head."
NOT SHOT IN STRUGGLE.
Autopsy Surgeon Louis D. Baciga
lupi, who has wide experience as an ex
pert in gunshot wounds, declares em
phatically that Buttgenbach was not
shot during a struggle. He also sup
plies an important piece of testimony
against Albert Buttgenbach.
"In my opinion Joseph Buttgenbach
was not shot during a struggle." says
Dr. Bacigalupi. "I think that theory
highly improbable from the wound and
course taken by the bullet. A man
standing at the corner of the scale and
shooting at an oblique angle would hit
Buttgenbach about where the bullet
struck, If the last named was at work
at his desk. It is not clear to me how
Buttgenbach could have been shot dur
ing a struggle, as the hole in the glass
shows the bullet did not go through
in a straight line but on an acute angle.
In order to shoot In that manner it be
comes necessary to place the gun
against one of the Iron columns of the
scale, a position that would not be
adopted by a thug shooting on the spur
of the moment. I examined Albert
Buttgenbach in the prison and was un
able to find any evidence of a blow on
the head, such as he claims to have re
ceived. At that time he told me that
he did not have his hat on when
stopped by the thugs at the door."
Jn view of the fact that the younger
Buttgenbach's hat was found on the
scale immediately after the shooting,
directly under the bullet hole, and that
he testified at the Inquest yesterday
that he wore his hat when stopped at
the door, the statement of Dr. Baciga
lupi is of Importance.
SAW 3IAN* RUXXIXG.
"What was regarded as evidence that
would clear Albert Buttgenbach of all
suspicion was reported to the police
yesterday by Hugo P. Trau and F. B.
Connolly, grocers at 313 Fourth street.
Subsequent developments, however,
demonstrated their testimony to be of
little value. Trau and Connolly said
that they were standing at the south
east corner of Fourth and Fol3om
streets and were startled by a shot.
They then saw a man run from Ship
ley street toward Folsom. After sprint
ing a short distance he retraced his
steps and vanished in the darkness.
They describe the fellow as being of
slight build and wearing a fedora hat
and dark clothes.
At the Coroner's inquest Stephen Sla
vich, a 18-year-old youth, testified that
he was in front of Buttgenbach's, store
and ran up Fourth street a short dis
tance upon hearing the shot. He then
hastened back to the scene of the shoot
ing. Both Connolly and Trau saw Sla
vich at the inquest and after talking
with him decided that he corresponded
in size and dress to the fellow they
had seen running. Connolly, said last
evening that he was convinced that
it was Slavich and not a thug he bad
seen after the shot was fired. Trau is
of the same opinion and thinks the
testimony of himself and partner of r.o
importance.
The inquest into the murder of Jo-
Eeph Buttgenbach, shot on Saturday
night in his office at the Pacific Pack
ing-house, was begun yesterday be
fore Coroner Leland. The day's work
made it painfully evident that the po
lice have failed In their effort to dis
cover evMence that would lead to the
apprehension of the murderer or even
lend more than argumentative color
to their theory that it was commit
ted by Albert Buttgenbach, the vi<>
tim's son.
One of their star witnesses, the ne-
Kto Mason, after confessing his bitter
hatred of the young man, further dis
appointed the detectives by admitting
that he was uncertain whether the in
strument he saw in Albert's hands
shortly before the shooting was a re
volver or .-v monkey-wrench. This
ends his usefulness as a witness for
the State. The bookkeeper, Brune,
and young Buttgenbach himself were
on the stand and retold without
change their former stories of the
events surrounding the crime. Efforts
to shake their testimony failed.
One of the sensations of the hearing
was the testimony of Stephen Slavlch,
an intelligent lad, who declared that,
standing on the sidewalk in front of
Puttpenbach's packing-house, he heard
the shot fired from the assassin's re
volver, and that it was immediately
followed by a loud groan, the noise of
falling glass and the sound of a scuf
fle. Two new witnesses, H. P. Trau
and F. B. Connolly, who were expected
i>Â» testify that they'saw a man run out
of Shipley street shortly after the ehot
was fired, will say on Thursday that
they now believe it was the boy Slavich
whom they saw.
The Coroner's jury spend the morn
ing at the packing-house at Fourth
and -Shipley streets, where the mur
der was committed. Under the guid
ance of Detective Thomas L. Ryan,
who is especially assigned to the case,
the Jurors viewed the places men
tioned in the witnesses' statements
' and listened to some preliminary tes
tim~-v. The afternoon hearing was
\\c\k ;i! the Coroner's office.
SERGEANT GREENE'S ACCOUNT.
Ryan took the jury over the entire
1 'remises at the packing-house and
*-xplained briefly how the proprietor
had been shot down when preparing
to close his establishment for the
â¢right. Coroner Leland then called on
Police Sergeant Greene, who related
that, on Saturday night shortly after
3 0 o'clock, as he was at Fourth and
Folsom streets on his way to report
for duty, he heard a shot and running
down Fourth street found a crowd
collecting before Alpers & Heide's sa
loon. In the rear of this he discov
ered Albert Buttgenbach breaking
through the board partition that sep
arated the saloon from the meathouse.
After putting him under arrest he
went with Brune through the partition
;.nd into the office by way of the rear
door. There they .saw Joseph Butt
penbach lying face downward on the
floor with a bullet wound in his head,
and on turning him over found sev
eral 3S-caliber cartridges under him.
These probably had been emptied
from a revolver in a struggle with an
assailant before he fell. The front
door leading from the office into the
Ftore was half closed and the glass in
it had been broken, falling outside in
the hallway. Green continued:
When I ordered Albert Duttgenbach taken to
the nolice station he a*ked for his hat, and
U fcas found outsid? the office on the scales.
iU5t w-here the man must have etood that fired
*t hie father. I examined all the possible
(Kits from the fa/tory and found that all the
doorÂ« were closed except the email Â«oor on
th* Fhipley etreÂ»t eide. where Albert told ur
the two me n had met him as he was going
'Â¦ut on hi* way home. He raid they ;ui!
f a*he<l oirtolf . in hlÂ« face and that he there
upon became frightened and ran back through
the office. W> K^arched everywhere for a re
volver, but fa lied to find any.
HOW THE SHOT WAS FIRED.
The police sergeant explained the
probable position of the murderer when
he fired at the meat packer through
the front window of the office. "He
must have held his revolver at an
oblique angle with the window pane,"
paid Greene, "because if it had been
pointed straight at the window the hole
in the glass would have been smaller."
Inasmuch as both Albert Buttgen
hach and Louis Brune had declared
that when flying from the footpads
they had heard, back in the engine
loom, the crash of glass falling from
the broken office door, but had not
heard the pistol shot, a test was made
to determine whether this was possi
ble. Detective Ryan sent the jurors
back to the stairway where the two
young men broke the partition, and
then he let a pane of glass fall on
the floor by the office door. The noise
was plainly heard all over the engine
room. Their alleged failure to hear
the shot is one of the peculiar things
told by the two men now under ar
rest, but as regards the glass the test
confirmed their statement.
At the afternoon session the first
witness examined was Louis E. Brune,
the bookkeeper, who is now held un
der suspicion of guilty knowledge of
the crime. He told his story in a
Ftraightforward ,way and showed no
signs of nervousness, answering many

he had seen young Bettgcnbach with a revolver shortly before the shooting. No. new testimony of importance Was developed. Captain Martin of the detective force and
Autopsy Surgeon Bacigalupi declare their belief that the fatal shot was not fired' during a scuffle . between, ftuttgenbach and his assailants. The contrary has been the contention of

and 4 years.
An exceptionally handsome - Western Addi-
tion block has Just been cut up Into 43 extra
latge lets, most of which are 33:4x120. The
block is near the corner of First ave. and
California st.. and can easily be reached by
the Eddy-st. and Sacramento-st. cars. Get
off at First ave. The conditions eurroondlng
the sale of this property are different from
the manner of selling property of this char-
acter.
Mr. J. C, Jordan, the owner, has imposed
the following conditions, which are to be rig-
idly enforced:
No- building will be allowed on the block
which will coet less than $3000.
No building shall be erected for objection-
able purposes, Including stores, livery stables.
coalyards, schools, churches, etc.
f No three-story flats will be allowed.
If you want to secure a nice residence site
; or make a good Investment the above common-
sense restrictions will Insure not only the ad-
vance in value of lots ln this block, but will
also protect any one who builds. Thousands
of people In the past few years have built
desirable homes and have been damaged or
ruined for the lack of just such protections.
In all other large cities in the Knited States
the best property is sold under similar condl-
1 tions, which sre erf beneflt to all.
Special attention is called to the large lots.
| It Is cheaper to build on a large lot than on a
small one, as It does away with the unsightly
and unsatisfactory light wells and shortens the
: building, bestdes giving a more artistic appear-
ance on the outside. The Interior arrangement
Is Â¦ much better and you secure an abundance ,
of light and sun.
The large lots and the restrictions under
which the land Is sold will Insure good neigh-
bors and an advance In the value of your
property. These, however, are not the only '
facts which will advance the property. The |
block is exceptltmally well located. Is level
and all the streets are graded, sewered and
macadamized and are all ?0 feet wide. The
property Is right on the line of tha city's
growth and the prices aaked, * $AO to $55 a i
front foot, are extremely low, as property I
within a block or two Is selling for from fvo i
to three times the price asked for this.
An unusually splendid car service is already
at hand. Including the Eddy-st. electric; the
Secramento-st. cable, the 8utter and Clement-
st. line and the Geary and Callforn!a-st. lines.
The last two are soon to be changed Into
electric systems. v
These are only a few of the points to which
we wish to call your attention. We urgently
request you to make an Immediate inspection
of this property, and believe that if you do
you will agre* with us that the property pre-
sents an unusual and unequaled opportunity
for either a homeseeker (including 2 flats) as
well as an excellent Investment. If you will
look ahead for a year or two and take Into
consideration the rapid growth of the city
In this direction you will undoubtedly become
a purchaser.

Sixty Per Center Arrives.
The overdue Norwegian ship j Theodor, on
which reinsurance at 60 per cent had been
paid, arrived here yesterday, 172 days from
Montevideo. Local speculators invested' about
J500U on 'the vessel to arrive and will mors
than double their money by the ship's safe
arrival. This Is one of the few cases in some
months where the result has justified tho
judgment of the looal dabblers In overdue
shins Lone odds have been frequent, but
arrivals of the high raters few and far between.
There is -no change In the rates of the other

Sailors In Big. Demand.
The present demand for sailors at this port
is in excess of the supply and the ships Cissie
and Cast'e Rock are in the stream unable to
go to sea for lack of men. \ The whalers are
not responsible for the shortage, as the sea-
Boned sailor fights shy of the blubber hunters,
whose crews are made up, in the language of
the beach, of "green hands and stiffs." Many
crews will be wanted within the next month,
both for deep pea ships and for the vessels, of
the salmon . fleet. : ,

GERMAN BARK ALTAIR.
WHICH ARRIVED TESTER
DAY FROM ANTWERP.
The German bark Altair, Captain R.
Fortmann, arrived yesterday from Ant
werp, havingr winged her way from
the old world port in 106 days, one of
the smartest passages on record.
The Altair was ninety-nine days
from the Lizard and was only five
days rounding Cape Hor;i. She had her
full share of heavy weather.losing some
sails in a gale encountered in the Eng
lish Channel and having her decks
swept and damaged on several occa
sions by big seas. r , t
She reached port irr'sood condition,
however, and to her credit one of the
fastest trips from Antwerp made since
1886.
The record sailing time from Ant
werp to San Francisco is 100 days, or
three months and a third, and was
made In 1886 by the British ship Mara
val. Prior to that the record was held
by the American ship Spartan, which
arrived here February 22, 1883, 101 days
from Antwerp. The Spartan was a fa
mous ship in day - when the Yankee
clipper was the finest and fastest ves
sel afloat. She is still in commission
and arrived here yeterday from Puget
Sound with 1,000,000 feet of lumber on
board.
The British ship City of Delhi made
the trip from Antwerp to this port in
1800 in 108 days. The Linlithgowshire
in 1888 made the trip in 104 days. Prob
ably the fastest passage on record from
an old world port Is held by the British
ship Merioneth, which about a dozen
year? ago came from Liverpool in nine
ty-six days.

The Civil Service Commission yes
terday transmitted to Mayor Schmitz
a communication in which it submits
for the consideration of his Honor for*
any action he may deem proper in
the premises, certain official acts of
Auditor Baehr, which it considers are
in violation of the civil service pro
visions of the charter. The commis
sion specifies the particular sections
of the charter which it alleges Baehr
violated, the specifications being set
forth in a tabulated statement. The
communication says further:
"This statement, which was taken
from the Auditor's books, shows war
rants drawn by him in payment of
clerical work done on the assessment
roll in his office. In each instance
are shown the month in which the
warrant was drawn, its number, the
payee and the amount. Opposite the
names of the civil service men ap
pear the letters 'C. S.' All the others
are non-civil service men, appointed
in violation of the law, and all such
warrants, it is charged, were approv
ed by the Auditor in violation of one
or more of the charter provisions al
ready cited."
CIVILr SERVICK BOARD
APPEALS TO THE MAYOR
BERLIN, March 8. â Lieutenant
Karl Bezeke (.retired), after a long
and steady decay of fortune, yester
day took his last money and gave, a
splendid dinner in honor of his 19
year-old-daughter's birthday. Bezeke
then poisoned his wife and daughter,
two sons, respectively 12 and 16 years
old. cadets at a military academy, and
himself with cyanide of potassium,
which he seemingly inserted in the
mouth of each in the form of a pill
after they had gone into a drunken
sleep.
The sheriffs had taken charge of
everything in the house and labels had
been attached to Bereke's furniture,
etc., which would have been sold at
auction to-day.
After a brilliant career and a mar
riage with an heiress Bezeke had
reached the end of his fortune. He won
-the iron cross during the war of 1870-71
with France, married the daughter, of
a rich hotel-keeper, thereby having to
leave the service, as he married out of
his caste, and started a newspaper. The
lieutenant wrote well, but the paper
was not successful and he became
sales agent for a manufacturer and
then manager of a map-making enter
prise. He lived beyond hi3 means for
thirty years. Last night the Bezeke
family had a box at the circus. At 10
o'clock dinner was ordered. Bezeke was
especially gay and tender and pressed
his wife and three children to drink
lots of champagne. He died holding
his wife's hand tightly.
WASHINGTON. March 8.â The Sen
ate spent the entire day listening to
the committee amendments to the
army bill concerning provisional
troops in the Philippines and the con
solidation of the adjutant general's
office with the record and pension of
fice. The Pot-to Rican amendments
were objected to by Democratic Sena
tors us tending: to a more pronounced
military form of government. Both
amendments ultimately were accepted.
The bill was amended so as to pro
vide for an Increased engineer corps.
It was still pending when the Senate
adjourned.
Teller moved to disagree to thÂ«
Senate amendment making* the regi
ment consist of three battalions in
stead of two, as fixed by the House.
The suggestion caused debate, which
took a wide range, concerning the use
of native troops in the dependencies.
Teller. Stewart, Spooner, Foraker,
Daniel, Carmack, Money, Morgan and
Quarles participated. In the course of
his remarks Foraker said that any
intimation that the President desired
to use the Porto Rican troops for an
improper purpose was unfounded. Car
mack said he took the proposition as
an indication of a tendency toward a
military government, saying that the
"distinguished soldier," Mr. Root,
had been mustered out of the office of
Secretary of War with flying flags and
blowing horns and that his successor
had been inducted into office under
similar condition?.
"Now," he said, "we are to have a
military display on the presentation
of diplomats. I am sorry the order
for that system was too late for
Bunau-Varilla. I would have liked to
have had the system in vogue on his
arrival and would have been glad to
command It."
Teller's amendment was rejected
and the provision for three battalions
was retained.
The Senate also returned to the
committee the amendment transform
ing: the adjutant general's office into a
military secretary's department. Proc
tor said the amendment was in the in
terest of operative detail, and he de
fended General F. A. Ainsworth, at the
head of the record and pension office,
against the charge of too rapid promo
tion. The provision promotes General
Ainsworth from a brigadier to a major
general. The amendment was
agreed to.
Culbertsdn suggested an amendment
providing for an increase In the en
gineer corps, explaining the necessity
for a larger number of engineer of
ficers in the river and harbor work of
the country. With some modifications
the amendment was accepted. It pro
vides that the corps shall be composed
of ten colonels, sixteen lieutenant
colonels, thirty-twq majors and forty
three captains, forty-three first lieu
tenants and forty-three second lieu
tenants.
An amendment was proposed for the
retirement with advanced rank of of
ficers who served in the Civil War. so
as to make it retroactive. The amend
ment was accented.
"With the bill still pending the Sen
ate at 5:54 p. m. adjourned, after a
brief executive session.

jobbing character, *ut all dealers reported a
good demand for shipment to near-by towns,
and the iecent arrivals of Oregon Burbanks,
ex-steamer, were gradually cleaning up. The
top quotation for Oregont was shaded, as there
was no strlctlv fancy stock offering from first
hands. In fact, the bulk of the supplies were
of low grade and seme- very poor lots sold on
the wharf at $1 15 per cental. Fancy Rivers,
were In good request and firm, while poor

NEW YORK. March 8.â Testerday's disap
pointment over the non-appearance of ! the
Northern Securities decision still weiishrvl upon
the market to-day and threw it ha " Into the
rut of dullness and sluggishness â¢ .icÂ»i re
stricted itÂ« movement last week. It was evl
, deijt that j-esterday's brief spurt of activity
had resulted in closing up pretty much all the
short interest which was opened as a result
of the expected handing down of the Northern
Securities decision. It is expected that as the
week draws to a cUw=e short lines will be put
out again In a tentative way to be covered
araln on Monday afternoon should thevdecls
ion still be withheld. The movement of prices
to-day was not consistent In one direction, for
as much as an hour, during the whole session.
Prices fluttered for a time either above or be
low ypptrrday's level, but without getting far
from that In cither direction. A more cheer
ful tone In th<Â» foreign market helped the
openln". Tbe London settlement was report
ed to "Vx> progre*ring favorably, and encour
agement was expressed that Paris once more
Fhowed a disposition to buy stocks In London.
Northern Securities made a further decline
ar.d with the persistent celling of Pennsylvania
undermined thÂ« market and made the closing
w*Â»k at the loweÂ«t.

Th* floods in the Sacramento ar.3 San Joaquin
valleys have mostly sobalded and dra.Ir.inz of
the . v. -.!,:Â¦- ie In progress. In all Btctions
< xcept the overflowed land? grain and grass

Â¦ir-ea T*eC is plentiful in nearly ail places, and
1 atxla are improving. The planting of sumraer
tanSena is in progress. In .Southern California
the rainfall ot tht preceding wÂ«rek was very
beneficial- and tbe soil is in very good condi
tion.
" Deciduous fruit trees are rapidly coming into
L!-Â»uin in nearly all sections, and the present
ouiluok is good Jur excellent crop*. The acre
age in fruit trets and grapes has been con
s-:<;..rably incrvased. It lsre-pcrted that citrus

KAN JOAQUIN VALLEY â The weather dur
ing the fore part or the w?Â»k was cloudy, with
gÂ»od rains, and the latter part clear and warm.
Three conditions wrre most favorable for all
growing crop* and green feed. Grain and grass
arc making rapid rrowth and green leed is
plentiful la mott sections. Much of the low
:.-.:. s.\ northeast of Stockton and some of the
island* in thf: San Joaquin were flooded by
breaking of the leveem and crops eertously
dama*rÂ»-d. Tbr water is now falling fast and
1.0CK of the overflowed land will be planted
later in potatoes. In many places the ground
that wan too dry for winter plowing is now
b<Sng fumir.'.r-f allowed. Apricots, almonds and
plums are ia bloom. Irriration water is plen
tiful, fitock are thin, but Improving rapidly.
HcffTT mow 1* reported in the Sierras.
HOI'THEKN CALIFORNIAâ The weather
wÂ»s warm an<* partly cloudy during the" week,
witii llrht wextprly wind?, and conditions were
favorable lor all crops. The rain at the close
of the preceding week was very bcneflcUt,
marly all of it having twen absorbed by the
Foil Grain ir lookinz well and making rapid
growth: v.uh th* rustomary rpring rains it is
probable that a fair crop will be raised. Green
â¢r'O is becoming plentiful on the hills and in
the valley* aird cattle are improving. Garden
rrakinr U in progress. Citrus fruits were
never in better condition, ar.d all other fruit
tree* arÂ« looking well.
LOS ANGELES SUMMARYâ Crops generally
mafic frood growth Â»nd will not suffer for rain
j or a week or ten day*. Grain, with .good
spring rains, will make fair hay crop. Oranges
arÂ«- o\-Â«-rripe In some places Â«nd dropping.
EUREKA SUMMARY â Owing to continuous
i-alny weather ail farm work is suspended. The

CHICAGO, March 8. â Contradictions of the
reported settlement ot the Argentine strike
caused an improved tone', In wheat.' Notwith
standing a considerable Cecllne at Liverpool
May here was steady, with prices %c lower to
%c higher at. tta%c. to Â»4%c. -t July was up a
snade to %Â«j%c at b9t*c to 9ov4c. For .a
time the maiKel ruled quite firm, aided by tho
strength In coarse grains. Â¦ Another bull fac
tor was the absence of ,raln; In- Kansas and
Oklahoma.'. In addition there x was, as com
pared with last year, a smaller movement in
the Northwest, tshorts covered, freely in both
May and July, the latter option selling up tÂ»
iÂ»0VÂ»c, while May sold firm fet Â»4%c. Toward
the middle of the day, however, the sentiment
chanred. ;On an attempt of some of the bull
crowd to I dispose of. their holdings, the pit
crowd suddenly took the gelling side of uie
market. There was apparently no wheat
wantedA and before buyers could be secured
prices slumped severely, May ttropptng to 92c.
whlle"July sold off to ttÂ»ttc. Large receipts In
Kansas City,- which seemed -to show that com
paratively little, alarm is' felt "In that section
as to the growing crop, Â¦ was apparently " the
bear factor. The market rallied slightly sev
eral times late In the day, â¢ but ' on each up
turn commission houses had plenty of selling
orders. Just before the close extreme weak
ness again developed and Â¦Â¦ May declined i to
01%c, a- loss of 2%c from the high point of
the day. July dropped. to 87%c, a decline of.
2%c from the top. Final figures on "May were
tUÂ»4c. July closed at 88c.
Hlzher prices at Liverpool due to reported
unfavorable weather ' in Argentine caused
strength In corn rit early in* the session. The
close was comparatively steady and lower,
with May at 53%c. â¢ Y
Oats met with a fair, scattering demand
from commission houses during the first part
of the session ,and with light offerings prices
were moved up nearly a cent for â¢ May and
July. The close was fairly steady, May clos
ing i,Â£c to %c higher. at 42Â«4e. .. â¢ -
A big reduction In receipts -of hogs and'.an
advance in prices at the yards caused firmness
In provisions early in .the, session. (There was
considerable liquidation both by local and out
side holders late in the, day, owing to the
weakness in sra-ins. All. of the! advance was
lost p.nd the close was near the. bottom. May
pork closing unchanged, lard up 2%c and ribs
a shade louver. "â¢-.w." " r-

the demand was limited In eonsequence. The

drawn, as stocks in coU) storage are prac

The Orange market was weak and very
much depressed at the opening.- owing to the
stormy weather, which prevaited during the

ernMy later In the day. when the weather be
can? milder, ' and In the afternoon a good
moveuimt ! was noted In the standard and
choice grades of Navels, which have been
having the most call of late. Fancy fruit was
stl!l neglected, but was flrmly held, as .stocks
wrre comparatively light. Eight cars are an
nounced for to-day's auction. The other Cit
rus fruits were without quotable change and
the best offf-rings of all descriptions met with
a fÂ»ir irquiry. Stocks of Bananas In thÂ«
cÂ« liars were large, but ripe stock was not
o\er iMÂ«rt ! fut and prices were well maintained.

. The feeling tn Butter haÂ» been unsettled for
several days, the market being steady one day
and weak the next. Yesterday the feeling was
easier, as some orders for the north were re
ported canceled owing to a decline in thÂ« East
ern market, which enable* the north to buy
there cheaper than here. Quotations, however.
remained unchanged.
While there is no actual decline In Cheese,
the disposition is to quote lower, as stocks
are sttil too heavy and ; the demand continues
very Â»4ow. '
Eggs will probably bo very unsettled from
now on, for .buying In the country for storage
purposes has begun and buyers are paying net
city prices in the country. This confuses the
situation and renders accurate quotations in
San Francisco difficult to give. This condition
will doubtless continue for weeks, perhaps for
several months. Already its effects are ap

mens being very creditable. The Chi
nese pupils also submitted exhibits of
their penmanship, both in the Eng
lish and the Chinese language.
The work of the Polytechnic High
and Manual Training schools is yet to
be received and. when it is there will
be ten cabinets of specimens, to be for

Extraordinary precautions were
taken yesterday morning to prevent
George Sterling, alias Joseph O'Brien,
making his escape while being taken
from the County Jail to Judge
Dunne's court to be arraigned on
charges of robbery and assault to
murder. Detectives O'Dea, Mulcahy
and Bailey were sent by Captain Mar
tin to asist. four Sheriff's deputies.
Sterling was the last in a gang of
fourteen prisoners who were chained
together and handcuffed. He is pos
sessed of a powerful wrist and while
in the van he used his wrist to such
purpose that when he stepped out of
the vehicle at the Hall of Justice the
chain was found to be broken. The
handcuffs were still on his wrists and
he was surrounded before he had a
chance to bolt. He was taken to the
courtroom and after being arraigned
pleaded not guilty and the cases were
continued till Friday, when he will
plead.
The same precautions were taken
on the trip back to the County Jail.
Sterling has repeatedly stated that he
would take the first opportunity to es
cape. He is looked upon as one of
the most dangerous crooks in the
State and has served a term for burg
lary. He robbed George W. Evans,
proprietor of a restaurant at 224H
Third street, on November 16 and
when cornered by Detective O'Dea at
tempted to shoot him. He got away
frorri O'Dea and was later arrested in
San Bernardino.

BERKELET, . March 8.â The list of
men engaged to participate in the ac
tivities of the next summer school at
the University of California, which was
completed at the university to-day, re
veals that there will be brought tÂ»:
gether at this session some of the most
distinguished scientists and scholars
in the world. No such gathering of
world famous men has ever been prom
ised before to any summer school and
it is' doubtful if any such fortuitous
circumstances as controlled this year
will occur again to draw these leaders
of thought into so close communion.
In securing the services of these men
President Wheeler and Dr. Leon J.
â¢Richardson, dean-elect for the sum
mer school, have been helped material
ly by fortune, though they are entitled
to all credit for their initiative, and
bold enterprise.
First of all there will come to the
session five men distinguished for their
achievements in five separate lines of
scientific Investigation, all of them men
with reputations for 'discoveries hav
ing Important bearing on subjects af
fecting human existence. Then there
is a group* of scholars and teachers
of history such as could not.be found
elsewhere in the . United States, . four
men whose researches have done much
1o revolutionize the story of the past
and to defend it with the weapons of
science. And besides these nine men
there will be. thirty-four others, some
from the East, but most of them from
California; some of them leaders' in
their" work, but most -of them men of
growing reputations. '

special course on the history of the
Elizabethan period; Professor Moses
will discuss "Government and *Philip
ptne institutions. Professor Thomas
W. Pago pf California will teach med
ieval history. *
In' the English department the sum
mer school will be particularly well
equipped. Two members of the faculty
will come from the East and the third
from' California. Francis B.- Gummere
of Haverford College ' and Hammond
Lamont, editor of the New York Even

Harvard and Professors Bernard
Moses and H. Morse Stephens of the
regular, history faculty of the.universi

be of more than usual interest to teach
ers and it will be conducted with spe

methods of teaching history.
Professor Turner, who has had mark

tory, will 'confine.' himself to American
history,, # urion which subject he - is a
