' CALL BUREAU. POST BUILDING,
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20â Engineer
Lippincott, In charge of the Govern
ment reclamation work In California,
was before the House Committee on
Irrigation and Arid Lands to-day, ex
plaining and arguing for the Sacra
mento Valley project. This, he said,
â¢was the most extensive proposition un
der consideration by the reclamation
â¢en-ice. A great amount of preliminary
work has been done, which shows the
feasibility and practicability of the
plan.
In order to properly solve the prob
lems it offered, he said, forestry, drain
age, irrigation and the navigability of
the river must all be taken into con
sideration. The preliminary surveys
had discovered an unusual number of
excellent reservoir sites on practically
all the tributaries of the Sacramento
and storage facilities undoubtedly can
be developed, he asserted, to restrain
the flood and regulate the flow of the
river. Such protection would require
the construction of a series of levees.
The construction of these would ren
der available many thousands of fer
tile acres now annually overflowed and
of little value.
The magnitude of the project and the
limited amount of money in the recla
mation fund, Lippincott said, would
cause t'.vÂ» department to go slow In the
matter, but a great deal of preliminary
V.ork, such as the measurement of
streams and a survey of the reservoir
sites, had yet to be done. The mem
bers of the committee asked a great
many, questions.
It was with the Sacramento Valley
project in mind that Bell introduced
his. bill yesterday designed to place
swamp and overflow lands under the
provisions of the reclamation act. This
bill is under consideration by the com
mittee.

CHICAGO, Jan. 20.âThe San Fran
cisco, Idaho and Montana Railroad,
which has recently been incorporated
and which is capitalized at $50,000,000,
Is believed to be a move of J. J. Hill
to reach into Southern Pacific terri
tory. The company's officers are:
President. William Peyton 'Mason of
Minneapolis; vice president, C. H.
Fleming of Minneapolis; secretary,
G. T. Propper of Boise; treasurer, W.
K. Foran of Boise. The incorporators
are prominent financial men of Minne
apolis, closely associated with J. J.
Jlill.
The road will be about 1000 miles
long, will reduce the distance between
San Francisco and Butte more than
300 miles and will open up a rich sec
tion of country. It will go southwest
from Butte through the Mormon settle
ments and on from Salt Lake to San
Francisco. Later a road is to be built
from Sioux City and Omaha, across
Northern Nebraska, to Denver and Salt
Lake, connecting with the line beyond
that city to the coast.

Santa-Fe Southern
Pacific Deal
Alleged.
Business in California Said
to Have Been Divided
Between Tbem.
Report That Morton and Stubbs Drew
Up Fooling Arrangement Which
Held shippers at Mercy.
NEW YORK, Jan. 20.âThe American
prints what purports to be a copy of
an actual pooling agreement made be
tween the Southern Pacific Company
and the Santa Fe, providing for a divi
sion of business and earnings. This
agreement was signed by J. C. Stubbs
of the Southern Pacific and Paul Mor
ton as an official of the Southern Cali
fornia Railroad Company, the name of
that part of the Santa Fe operating in
California.
The agreement, in brief, shows that
California was divided in two by arbi
trary lines and that there was between
the two railroads a full arrangement
as to rates, commodities and points
shipped to and from. Each road was
to report to the other as to the business
done and the actual rates collected.
The California shippers were absolutely
at tho mercy of these two roads.
At the time the agreement was sign
ed, it was in violation of two distinct
laws âthe Sherman anti-trust and the
interstate commerce law. Both laws
provided at that time for a punishment
by a fine of $5000 and imprisonment in
the penitentiary. In the case of the
Sherman anti-trust law, imprisonment
would have been for one year, and in
the case of the interstate commerce
law, imprisonment would have been
for not mdre than ttyo years. Legal
experts say that neither Stubbs nor
Morton can be prosecuted, because the
offense, which the agreement indicates
they are guilty of, has been outlawed
by the statute of limitations.
Traffic Director Stubbs of the South
ern Pacific has always denied with em
phasis that his road had any pooling
agreement with the Santa Fe or any
Bert of agreement.

ST. PETERSBURG IS ON VERGE
OF A RIOT AND REVOLT.
The Russian capital is on the verge of an incipient revolution and guards have been hurriedly summoned to preserve the peace. Thousands of
workmen paraded the streets yesterday and mobs compelled factories, mills and business houses to close. The strike has taken a political turn
and it is feared that there will be bloodshed. Theguards*who shot at the Czar Thursday are under arrest and an investigation is being made.
THOUSANDS OF WORKMEN PARADE STREETS
â¢ 4- 4.
Mobs Compel the Factories
and Mills to Close.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 20âWith
the Russian capital seemingly on the
verge of an incipient revolution, thou
sands of workmen parading the streets,
agitators and fanatics sowing the seeds
of disorder, half the city in darkness
and without Are protection, owing to
walkouts, the situation was hourly
growing more tense to-night, when the
authorities decided to adopt energetic
measures to preserve order, prevent
rioting and overawe the violent-mind
ed, at the same time seeking to pla
cate the striking workmen by offering
satisfaction of their demands. In so far
as they are just and reasonable, thus
acting with combined firmness and
raoderat! n.
The Government to-night augmented
the garrison of St. Petersburg with 25*0
cavalry and 1000 infantry from Tsar
skoe-Selo and filled the streets, espe
cially in the disaffected quarter, with
heavy patrols of soldiers.
The refusal to permit a delegation of
workmen to present a petition to Em
peror Nicholas at Tsarskoe-Selo has
made it known that the great demon
stration planned for Sunday with its
unlimited possibilities for an outbreak
will not be permitted to take place. At
the same time, acting in conjunction
with a conference of employers, it has
been determined to offer concessions in
the terms of employment, which the
employers declared the great majority
of the workmen would be inclined to
accept if they were guaranteed protec
tion from the more violent faction.
KATHEIt GOPOX IX CUSTODY.
It was reported late to-night that
Father Gopon, leader of the workmen,
had been quietly spirited away from
his bodyguard arid taken into custody,
in furtherance of the plan to disorgan
ize the elements that are threatening
the peace of St. Petersburg.
The authorities believe that by tllese
steps they have the situation well in
hand and announce they expect a
peaceful solution of the problem.
The situation reached an acute stage
to-day, and the strike assumed an open
political phase. The day was one of in
tense excitement. Mm atter mill and
factory after factory closed.
Throngs of workmen paraded the
streets, and, when their colleagues re
fused to join them, broke down gates
and forced out the men. The whole in
dustrial center is idle.
All the textile mills and every print
ing office in St. Petersburg are closed.
One electric light plant and one water
plant have shut down, and more than
100,000 men are out.
Throughout the day workmen's meet
ings were held, at which incendiary
speeches were made, the wildest threats
being uttered as to what would come, in
the event of the authorities and em
ployers failing to meet their demands.
The nervousness and dread of what
the next few days might bring forth
was increased by reports that the
workmen of Moscow, Keiff, Kharkeff.
Kishineff and other large cities in the
interior might join the movement.
While the Government and employers
temporized, the telegraphers and rail
road emplqyes threatened to Join the
walkout, paralyzing the communica
tions of the country. Mai;y foreigners
are preparing to send their families
abroad. Every newspaper in St. Pe
tesburg has been forced to suspend
publication, owing to the strike.
SUDDENNESS OF STRIKE.
The suddenness of the strike and thtÂ»
far reaching nature of the workmen's
organization was largely a surprise to
the Government and the employers.
Starting with the walkout of a few
thousand employes of the Putiloff Iron
Works, due purely to industrial causes,
it spread as rapidly as a conflagration
through the labor classes of St. Peters
burg and became general. At first only
industrial demands were presented,
such as shortening the hours of labor
and for increases of wages; but poverty
and discontent, under the incitement of
â¢Social Democratic agitators, led to the
formulation of political demands.
A petition was drawn up and largely
signed, which, going beyond the com
plaints on which the strike originated,
attacked the whole capitalistic system
of the country, bitterly assailed the
present Government as one of bureauc
racy and demanded the reform of
} both, asserting that death was prefera-
I ble to existence under such conditions.
This was to have been presented per
sonally to Emperor Nicholas. A depu
! tation of workmen endeavored to see
his Majesty at Tsarskoe-Seloe and ap
peal to him to come to the Winter Pal
ace Sunday to be present at an Im
mense demonstration of the industrial
classes. It was planned to have the
workmen in St. Petersburg, headed by
their leader, the priest Gopon, In full
gorgeous canonical garb, march to the
palace and assemble in the great pa
rade grounds in front of the palace and
there present the petition to his Ma
jesty. The deputation, however, will
be refused admission to Tsarskoe-Soloe.
The Government believes this will ren
der a meeting on Sunday impossible.
The priest Gopon is an interesting
personality. He is idolized by the
workmen, who, since the beginning of
the strike, have furnished him with a
bodyguard. He has been accompanied
everywhere by a score of persons and
has not been sleeping at his own home
for a week for fear of the contingency
of arrest by the police, which is report
ed to have already happened.
WATER WORKS GUARDED.

cated as a monk. His leaning toward
politics led to his exclusion from the
seminary and this exclusion prompted
a desire to get close to the people and
share their lot. He was determined to
become a priest in distinction from a
monk, and overcame many obstacles,
finally being graduated from the St.
Petersburg Ecclesiastic*! Academy. He
then took up work among the laboring
classes, whose leader he speedily be
came. He shows an evident genius for
organization. Father Gopon is believed
to be the heart and soul of the whole
movement.
No disturbance has so far been re
ported. There are heavy guards at the
waterworks and lighting plants and In
the factory districts.
Altogether 174 works in St. Peters
burg have been closed by the strike.
A proclamation has been issued for
bidding all assemblages, parades or

PETITION OF STRIKERS.
The following is the text of the strik
ers' petition to the Emperor:
"Sire: We, workingmen, inhabitants
of St. Petersburg, of all classes, oiir
wives, children and indigent parents,
come to you, our sovereign, asking for
protection. We are poor, burdened with
labor beyond our strength. We are in
sulted, treated not as men but as slaves
who ought to bear their cruel fats in
silence. We have suffered, but we are
being plunged deeper in the mire and
deprived of our rights. .Uninstructed.
stifled by destitution and injustice, we
are perishing. We have no strength
left. Sire, we have arrived at the ex
treme limits of endurance: we have
reached the terrible moment when
death is to be preferred to a continua
tion of our intolerable sufferings. We
have left our work and informed, our
employers that we will not resume un
til our demands are conceded. We
have not asked much; we have asked
but for means of livelihood, without
which life is a - burden and continual
torture.
"Our first request is that our masters
should investigate our case. They have
refused. We have been denied the right
to put forward our claims. It being held
that such rights are not recognised by
law." - -
After referring to the eight-hour day,
and other points in their caÃe. the peti
tioners continue:
"Any one of us who dares raise his
voice in the interests of the working

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 20.âInvestiga
tion of cpmplaints from long-suffering
people in the Antelope Valley, just
across the mountains from Los Ange

being enacted there. A ring of corrupt,
law-breaking officials has assumed
such absolute control that the princi

"blind pig" gambling hell, whence
'schools and courts are-dominated. A
little New England teacher, Miss Ade

aroused the whole law-abiding people
and the whole valley is torn
up over her case.
The president of the Board of School

holds the positions of deputy constable
and â¢ Republican committeeman. He
conducts a dive in Palmdale, violating
the liquor law, and running an almost
continuous poker game. The school
mistress is practically compelled to live
in his house to save her Job. - His best
customer is another member of the
School Board, R. B. Burns, who is also
poundmaster. He was found playing

GUNNERS WHO FIRED
SHOT AT THE CZAR
ARE NOW IN PRISON
Reports of a Conspiracy in
the Army Not Credited.
ST. PETERSBURG, Jan. 20.â1n the
midst of the fever of excitement to-day
over the strike situation the incident at
the Winter Palace Thursday attracted
secondary attention. Startling reports
of a widespread conspiracy and a
wholesale disaffection in the army seem
to be without foundation. Grand Duke
Sergius Michaelovitch, in his prelimi
nary report, shows thai the caisson- of
the battery contained charges of grape
in readiness for a possible emergency,
such as to rake the streets in case of
rioting, and a shotted charge was in
troduced into a gun in front of the sa
luting charge. The gunners are un
der arrest and their antecedents are
under examination, but it is impossible
to learn whether anything has yet been
discovered.
The military authorities are inclined
to believe that the incident was the
work of two men, orte of whom inserted
the missiles, while the other-trained the
gun. A witness reported that he had
seen a cannoneer carefully training the
gun, but this does not agree with the
statement made by Grand â¢ Duke Ser
gius to a prominent military attache
that the gun must have been pointed
downward, as the charge struck the ice
and ricochetted. Two balls entered the
Imperial pavilion, another pierced a
palace window, while others struck the
facade of the palace or, flying over the
palace, dropped around the statue of
Alexander I In the palace square be

INVESTIGATION IS ORDERED.
A special commission, under the
presidency of Lieutenant General Khit
roro, commander of the artillery corps
of the Guards, has been appointed to
investigate the origin of the firing. The
commission will work under the super
intendence of the inspector general of
artillery and of Grand Duke Sergius.
The report published in the United
States by a news agency of the suicide
of Captain Davidoff, commander of the
battery from which the shot is sup
posed to have been fired, is unfounded.

of the St. Petersburg pa
mpers on the morning after an occur
rence which nearly added another vio
lent death to the history of the ruling
family of Russia. There are prominent
headlines, but almost no editorial ref

sible of the unexpected hail of grape
shot around the little chapel in which
the Emperor and the Romanoff family
had gathered for the great religious
festival of the Epiphany and blessing
the waters of the Neva.
The account of the stately ceremo
nial prepared by the court marshal is
long and rich in detail, describing the
appearance and garb of the individual
participants and the progress of events
from minute to minute. Appended to
this court circular are short paragraphs
from various papers, alluding in the
most guarded terms to the unexpected
danger in which the Czar stood. These
add practically nothing to the knowl
edge of the event.
REGARDED AS GOOD OMEN.
The Novoe Vremya, which publishes
the most extended account, shows that
chief interest in the incident followed
the second and third shots, but offers
no explanation. The paper editorializes
briefly on the inexcusable carelessness
of permitting so perilous a happening
and on the general joy at the escape
of the Czar and the relief to strained
nerves. It concludes by expressing the
hope that the miraculous escape of the
Emperor from mortal danger while en
gaged in the pious rites of the faith
may be' an omen that Russia is under
like protection; that providence is
watching over those who Jive by faith,
and that she may emerge in equal
safety from the perils tn which she

SENATOR SMOOT A WITNESS
BEFORE BOARD OF INQUIRY
Says He Now Opposes Prac
tice of Polygamy and Is
Free to Act in Politics.
IS GIVEN A LONG EXAMINATION
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20â Interest in
the Smoot investigation before the
Senate Committee on Privileges and
Elections was increased to-day by the
unexpected determination to put Sena
tor Smoot on the stand in his own be
half, without waiting for other wit
nesses now en route from The
Senator was under direct and cross
examination all day and frankly an
swered most questions asked him. He
appeared to make a favorable impres
si6n on the members of the committee.
Senator Smoot was at his ease, al
though every eye in the room was di
rected to him. The first questions were
as to the Senator's nativity. He said
he was born in Salt Lake City ip 1862.
His father and mother are both dead.
His mother was a plural wife. Con
cerning his own family, he said he was
married on September 17, 1884, and has
"but one wife. They have six children.
He said that at the time of his mar
riage he did not take the endowments,
but that in 1880 he had gone through
the endowment house at the request of
his father, for the benefit of the lat
ter's health. He said he told his
father at that time that he did nÂ«t
care much about going through the
ceremony.
I FORGETFUL OF OATHS.
Senator Smoot said he had been en
gaged in the mercantile business most
Â©f" his life. The only office in the
â¢ church that he has held, other than
that of apostle, was counselor to th<*
president of the Utah Stake of Zion,
and he declared that he had taken no
oaths of any character when he be
came counselor, nor had he taken any
wath when he became an apostle.
Worthington asked Smoot about the
endowment ceremony and he replied:
"I-could not give it if I wanted to."
VWhy not?"
"Because I have no distinct recollec
tion of the ceremony."
Worthington read what witnesses
. have alleged to be the "oath of venge
ance" and asked Senator Smoot if
there was anything of that character
in the ceremony.
"There was not."
"Was there anything of vengeance
upon this generation?"
"No, sir."
"Was there anything about avenging
the blood of Joseph Smith?"
"There was not. And it would have
been strange if there had been. Jo
seph Smith was the instigator of the
endownment cepemony and it would
have been very strange if he had
asked his people to avenge his blood
when he was alive."
NOT CHURCH'S CANDIDATE.
"Was there anything in the ceremony
which would affect ycur loyalty to your
country?"
"There was not."
"How came you to be a candidate for
Senator."
"Well, I had been rather active in
politics before the division was made
on party lines. I took the leading pa
pers of both national parties and at
first believed myself gradually drifting
to the principles of the Republican
party and joiner! that party when the
division came. I announced my candi
dacy for the United States Senate in
lt<o2. Of course I knew of the rule
which required me to ask the president
of the church if I could run."
â¢'Here Worthington and
asked him to explain this rule. Senator
â¢Smoot replied that it referred only to
officials of the church and amounted
simply to a leave of absence from the
church duties.
."Was the Mormon church a factor in
politics in your candidacy for the Sen
ate?" asked Worthington.
"Not in the least. No more than the
Presbyterian or the Methodist
churches. No man or woman can say
that I ever asked them to vote the
Republican ticket because I was an
apostle. Whatever I did to promote my
candidacy was based upon Republican
arguments alone."
"What would be your position if the
president of the church should attempt
to influence your vote as a Senator?"
OBJECTS TO APOSTLES.
"I would not submit to it for a min
ute."
"What was the state of your knowl
edge regarding the polygamous rela
tions of President Joseph F. Smith up
to the time he testified before this com
mittee?"
"I knew that he had more than one
wife, but I knew nothing of the man
ner of his living."
"Witnesses have testified here that
the statement of President Smith took
the people by surprise. What was your
reeling in regard to that?"
"I was surprised at the number of
children born in his families since the
manifesto, but not surprised at all as
to the number of his wives."
. The Senator spoke of a meeting of
the apostles and the first presidency
before the October conference and he
said that at that meeting he inquired
of President Smith if Apostles Cowley
and Taylor had been sustained at the
April conference in view of the testi
mony before the Senate committee that
both of these apostles had taken plural
wives since the manifesto. The Senator
said he objected to having the men
sustained at the October conference

and was told by President Smith that
as a member of the church he ought to
know that an official or a member of
the church could not be excommuni
cated or disfellowÃhiped without an
investigation and hearing.
"I realized this," continued the Sena
tor, "but was told that an investiga
tion would be made and I have no
doubt that a very rigid inquiry is now
in progress. Without this promise I
would not have voted tp sustain them.
Up to the time of the testimony before
this committee I had no knowledge that
either of the apostles had violated the
law in that regard, nor had I heard
anything of the kind against any other
apostle except from the testimony
given in this room."

The Senator said that he did not be
lieve that any one who violated the
law by contracting a plural marriage
should hold a Federal position.
"To the best of my knowledge," he
added, "there is not a Federal office in
Utah filled by a polygamist. I know
that one postmaster was removed on
that ground and there have been other
cases of that kind." .
"Have you anything to do with re
ligion classes in Utah?" asked Worth
lngton.
"No; I have not. I have not the least
doubt that religion classes have been
held in the schoolÃ after school hours,
as was stated here," replied Smoot. "I
would like to add that I have always
thought it would be best for religion
classes not to be held in school
houses."
Worthington had put into the records
a recent order of the church prohibit
ing the use of school-houses for relig
ion classes. Senator Smoot said he was
glad this order had been issued. Tak
ing up the charges in the protest,
Worthington asked: "Have you in any
way since you became an apostle pro
mulgated or advised the practice of
polygamy?"
"I have not."
ENTERS GENERAL DENIAL.
"It is charged that the president of
the Mormon church and a majority of
the twelve apostles now practice polyg
amy, and some have taken plural
wives since 1890. Have you any knowl
edge on that subject, except that pro
duced here?"
"I have not."
"It is said these things have been
done with the knowledge and consent
of Reed" Smoot."
"That is not true."
"It is said that plural marriage cere
monies, have been performed by apos
tles.'"^
"Not to my knowledge."
"It is charged that many Bishops
and other high officials of the church
have taken plural wives since the man
ifesto."
"I have not heard of it except those
mentioned In the testimony."
CROSS-EXAMINATION BEGINS.
Tayler then took the witness for
cross-examination and asked him
about the Cannon and Hamlin alleged
marriage. Smoot 6aid that when Lil
ian Hamlin went to Provo it was un
derstood that she had been married to
Cannon before the manifesto. Pressed
for his views, since hearing the testi
mony given before the Senate commit
tee, Senator Smoot said he believed
now that the marriage took place about
1896.
"Have you been a Mormon all your
life?" asked Tayler.
"Yes, sir, but not a very active one."
Concerning the prosecutions for
polygamous co-habitation before the
manifesto, Senator Smoot said he was
aware of the sufferings of the families
of polygamists. He said that his
father was arrested, tried and acquit
ted. He said the manifesto made the
impression on him that It was going to
stop polygamy forever. He did not un
derstand that ,it disparaged the doc
trine of polygamy, buUthat it did dis
parage the practice. He said he be
lieved the revelation in regard to po
lygamy was received by Joseph Smith,
but he did not believe in the practice
of polygamy against the laws of the
land, and since the last decision of the
Supreme Court he had openly opposed
the practice.
FAITH IX HIS PARENTS.
Of his faith in his parents, Senator
Smoot said impressively: "No man
ever had a better mother in the world
than I had." It had been brought out
previously that Senator Smoot's moth
er was *a plural wife.
Senator Smoot said he thought that
President Smith would be condemned
If he abandoned his wives, and that
Pfesident Smith in an address had in
timated that he intended to continue
to be a husband of all of his wives.
"I believe that the men who took
plural wives before the manifesto," he
said, "took them with the sanction of
God. No law of the land could dis
solve the relations, but it could inter
fere with the carrying out of the mar
riage contract."
INFLUENCE OF CHURCH.'
"Suppose the president of the church
had refused to grant you a leave of ab
sence, what would you have done?"
asked Senator Overman.
"I don't know; I would have con
sulted my friends, and if I had con
cluded to run I would have resigned
from the apostleship."
"Would that have put you out of
harmony with the church?" asked Sen
ator Burrows.
"More than likely It would."
"But not if you resigned your apos
tleship; then you would not have been
out of harmony?" Vancott interrupted
to ask.
"Oh no, sir; I have the privilege of
resigning." *^
Senator Overman asked if there was
any reason why Smoot should get a
leave of absence rather than resign his
apostleship.
"There was no reason why I should
resign," Smoot replied.
"He would have been out of line for
the presidency of the church," inter
jected Worthington.
"Where do you stand in the line for
succession?" asked Chairman Burrows.
"Well, there have been three apostles
appointed since I was," answered
Smoot. "That would make me twelfth
in line."
Senator Burrows wanted to know if
action would have been taken against
him if he had been a candidate for the
Senate without leave of absence.
The witness did not think action of
any kind would have been taken.
OPPOSED TO ROBERTS.
"Has any apostle been deposed ex
cept Thatcher within fifteen years?"
asked Tayler.
"I think Apostles Carrington and Ly
man were deposed. Lyman was the

father of the present councilor to
President Smith. He was deposed for
apostasy," replied the Senator.
Referring to Roberts, once elected to
Congress, Smoot said that Roberts
would not have been elected if he could
have prevented it.
"Well, he was a Democratic caijdi
'date, andlyou were a R, lublican?"
"Yes."
Senator Smoot said heard it
said that the church favbred the can
didacy for the Senate of Senator
Reams, but he had never heard that
President Smith had asked any one to
support Senator Kearns. As to his
own candidacy, President Smith had
not advised him for or against being
a candidate at that time, although he
had talked the matter over with Presi
dent Smiih.
Tayler asked Senator Smoot If he did
not understand that most of those who
signed the amnesty plea continued to
violate the law. The names were read,
and the Senator indicated his belief
that a majority of the signers were re
puted to have violated the law. The
witness said he understood that the
signers and the people, so far as they
could influence them, would obey the
law regarding polygamy.
Senator Smoot took exception to the
statement of John Henry Smith in re
gard to his position in the eyes of the
law so far as polygamy was concerned.
The Senator said he knew of many oo
lygtfmists who were not living with
their plural wives.
TELLS OF APOSTLE TAYLOR.
"The Inquiry concerning the viola
tions of law by Apostle Taylor was
asked for by me before the last Octo
ber conference," said Senator Smoot.
"Where is Apostle Taylor now?" he
was asked.
"I don't know. I believe he it in
Canada."
Senator Smoot would not say that
the head of the church knew where
Taylor was. He believed Taylor could
go where he pleased without consult
ing the church.
"How long has he been away?" asked
Senator Overman.
"About a year, or since this investi
gation started," said Smoot: "I felt
very deeply the charge that Apostle
Taylor had taken twn plural wives
Bince the manifesto.'*
Tayler asked what action the presi
dent of the church had taken to se
cure the attendance of Apostles Taylor
and Cowley, and Senator Smoot called
attention to letters from both these
apostles saying they had not regarded
the investigation as religious and
therefore did not feel that they should
be expected to come. He said he could
not remember the exact form of these
letters, but that he had shown them to
Chairman Burrows.
Adjournment was then taken until
to-morrow.
SMOOT IN LAND DEALS.
Involved in Transactions Investigation
of Which Is Asked.
SALT LAKE, Jan. 20.âAttorney
General Moody has been requested to
make a searching Investigation of
deals in certain lands on the former
Uncompahgre Indian reservation, in
which Senator Reed Smoot is In
volved. A number of the claims were
bought by Jesse Knight of Provd, who
transferred a half-interest to Senator
Smoot for a nominal sum. The trans
fer was made after Congress had de
clared the titles invalid and after
Smoot had been elected to the Senate.
Since that time Smoot Â«nd Knight
have sold their holdings to C. O. Bax

amount, according to the records of
Uintah County, where the claims are
located, was paid to Smoot, the other
half to Knight. Baxter is now prepar

Asphalt Trust against the two men to
recover the amount paid them.
In connection with the affair it has

Foreigners Are Unlawfully

and Registration Books
Are Padded by the Officers
PUEBLO, Colo., Jan. 20.âThe Grand
Jury which has for two months been
investigating the election frauds in
Pueblo County, reported to the court
to-day and was discharged. One hun
dred new indictments were returned.
The Grand Jury, on which Democrats
and Republicans had equal representa
tion, reports the discovery of a con
spiracy, with its fountainhead in Den
ver, to control the election in this coun
ty by corrupt methods. The report says
in part:
We learn that the better element of our
community, deluded by the proud belief that
by their suffrages they were determining: the
affairs of the city and county and deciding
the destiny of the nation, was two, three, a
dozen, fifty times overbalanced by venal re
peaters and the manufacture' of hundreds of
fictitious registration* by officers sworn to
righteousness In public office.
Nearly 1800 foreigners received naturaliza
tion papers during September and October,
1904, from the County Court, and in many
instances they were Issued to aliens who had
never even applied for their first papers, but
were issued to them as minors who had been
in this country from two months to two years
and In almost every Instance were In excess
of eighteen years of age when they left their
native land.
The jury petitions the court to bring
the evidence of fraudulent naturaliza
tions to the attention of the United
States District Court and the United
States District Attorney. %
The jury found that the registration
books were padded to the extent of at
least 1000 names. Under the practice
in vogue of paying politic al workers the
vouching system, says the report, has
become "worse than 1 a farce."
Continuing, the report says that
spurious registration sheets were pre
pared under the direction of N. S. Wal
pole, recently appointed postmaster,
and deputies in the County Clerk's of
fice, mentioning W. E. Ennis, Percy H.
Ely and Oscar Q. McNeil and by City
Detective W. E. Wilson. It declares
that typewritten confessions have been
made by some of the men indicted. In
dictments are returned against all the
men named.
The report recommends that all reg
istration slips hereafter be numbered
and accounted for, the same as ballots
now are.
The report claims that the chairmen
of the two political parties secured
large amounts of $1 bills just previous
to election and suggests that this was
for the purpose of putc&asing votes.

FIND SPURIOUS BALLOTS.
f â 
DENVER, Colo.. Jan. 20.âWhen the
joint legislative committee, appointed
to hear the Peabody-Adams guberna
torial 'contest, met this afternoon the
report of the experts who examined
three Denver ballot boxes turned over
to them last night was made.
According to their testimony, 449 out
of the 904 ballots found in the boxes
were spurious.
On cross-examination the witnesses
refused to express an opinion on special
specimens of handwriting submitted to
them for comparison with each other
and with the alleged fraudulent bal
lots unless they were granted at lÂ«ast
twenty-four hours for examination.
They all testified, however, that they
hud reached their conclusions on the
hundreds of ballots submitted to them
after from four to six hours' work.
Une of the experts contradicted the
testimony of another one on the ques
tion of the practicability of comparing
handwriting in pencil and ink.
Efforts were made by the attorneys
for the contestee to break down the
testimony of the experts and to show
their unfitness for the position.
After the cross-examination two
more ballot boxes were opened and six
experts were put to work on them, with
instructions to report at 8 o'clock to
night, to which time the committee
took a recess.
After turning over two more ballot
boxes to experts, the committee again
took up the examination of Supreme
Court watchers. Pour were examined
and told stories of repeating similar
to those already brought out. At 10:15
the committee adjourned until 1:30 to
morrow afternoon, when it is expected
a report on the ballot boxes now being
examined will be made and the answer
of Governor Adams to the allegations
of former Governor Peabody will be
filed.

BIG SUM FOR ROADS
IN YOSEMITE PARK
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20.âAt a meet
ing of the Cabinet to-day Secretary
Hitchcock submitted a proposition
whereby the rights of way through the
Yosemite National Park might be
granted by the Secretary of the Interior
for eleotric railways. This had been
suggested by Representative Needharn
as a means whereby the projectors of
an electric line from Fresno might be
enabled to extend the line to a point
withfh a reasonable' distance of the
Yosemite Valley. It was, if acceptable
to the President, to have been added
as an amendment to the bill denning
the limits of the Yosemite National
Park. The President and the members
of the Cabinet were, however, unani
mous against it.
GUlctt's bill, which has passed the
House and was referred to the Senate
Committee on Forest Reserves, will
therefore be reported by Senator Kit
tredge to-morrow, It having been held
up pending this inquiry. This bill car
ries out the recommendations of the
Yosemite Park Commission, appointed
to ascertain what portions of the park
may properly be Included in the Sierra
forest reserve and to report on the nec
essary roads within the park boundary.
With regard to roads, the report, af
ter discussing the three roads into the
park by private enterprises, the dis
comforts of which, it says, often make
people sick, declares the committee is
convinced that the proper entrance to
the valley has not been found. The
Secretary of the Interior has asked
Congress for an appropriation of $180.

Park.

WASHINGTON, Jan. â20.âThe state

over without action. Pulton Bpoke in
support of the indemnity bill, and Mc

Immediately after the Senate was

laid before it a telegram from the Gov

memorial adopted by the Legislature
of that Territory, protesting against
the union of New Mexico and Arizona
in one State, and urging the admis
sion of New Mexico as a State with its
present boundaries. One of the rea
sons urged for admission was the fact
that New Mexico supplied more than
half of the members of the regiment of
Rough Riders, commanded during the
Spanish War by Colonel Theodore
Roosevelt.
The bill providing for the compensa

Without disposing of the fur-seal bill

on that measure. He announced his
advocacy of separate statehood for the
Territories of Arizona, New Mexico and
Oklahoma as they are now constituted.
Commenting upon the memorial of
the New Mexico Legislature; he said
that it appeared that the people of the
Territory were about as unanimous in
their opposition as were the people of
Arizona.
"Hence," he said, "the pending bill
must be considered in the light of a
force Bill, distasteful alike to all in
both Territories."
Bate opposed in vigorous language
the consolidation plan, declaring that
the union was not desired. He said:
"This double Territorial egg was laid
by the chairman of the House Commif

port of his committee, was hatched in

NEW POST FOR BRODJE.
Arizona's Governor Named Assistant
Chief of Pension Office.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20.âThe presi
dent to-day sent to the Senate the
nomination of Alexander O. Brodie of
Arizona to be Assistant Chief of the
Record and Pension Office, with the
rank of major. Brodie is now Governor
of Arizona. His term as Governor does
not expire until July 1, 1906.
There is an interesting story behind
the nomination of Governor Brodie.
Major Edward S. Fowler of New York
was appointed to the office last August
and his nomination has been before the
Senate for several weeks without final
action. It had been the intention of
the President to appoint Governor Bro
die to the office next May, when it
would become vacant, by the promo
tion of the incumbent to the grade of
lieutenant colonel by the retirement of
Lieutenant Colonel Tweedale of the
military secretary's department.
That plan has been abandoned, how
ever, because of a provision in the
army appropriation bill, now before the
House, to the effect that the office of
Assistant Chief of the Record and Pen
sion Office shall be abolished with the
next vacancy. In order, therefore, to
provide for Governor Brodie in that
office it became necessary for the Pres
ident to withdraw the nomination of
Major Fowler and substitute that of
Brodie. The latter Is a personal friend
of the President and served with him
in the Rough Rider Regiment during
the Spanish-American War.
Although still unconfirmed, Major
Fowler has served as Assistant Chief
of the Record and Pension Office since
August, 1904.

Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAN BERNARDINO, Jan. 20.âMrs.
Hattie Tyler.a young and pretty widow,
had a terrible experience last night
battling against the mad efforts of her
lover, C. H. Shaffln. to end his life.
Shaffin had called at the room of Mrs.
Tyler, to whom he had been engaged
since last October, and charged her
with being faithless. She became of
fended and ordered him away. He con
tinued to abuse her and she realizing
that he was not himself tried to pacify
him.
Suddenly he thrust her from him,
and drawing from his pocket a bottle
of carbolic acid was in the act of drain
ing the bottle's contents, when she
dashed it to the noor. The madman
quickly drew another bottle and Mrs.
Tyler flung herself upon him. A des
perate struggle ensued and finally
Shaffin promised to give up the idea of
taking his life. The woman released
him, and almost immediately he made
another attempt to swallow the poison.
Again Mrs. Tyler prevented him, and
once more Shaffin assured her he would
not take the drug. This promise, like
the first, he forgot as soon as Mrs. Ty
ler stepped away from him and made
another desperate attempt to take the
deadly draught.
Again and again did the frightened
woman foil Shafiin's attempts, until
finally she became exhausted when
Shaffin succeeded in swallowing the
poison. Mrs. Tyler hastily summoned
a physician, but the doctor arrived too
late.

STATE NOW ASSEMBLED IN THE CAPITAL CITY.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 20.âAn apology
from Senator Emmons for his hardi
hood in opposing similar measures and
the unexplained silence of Senator
Shortridge marked the unanimous
adoption by the Senate to-day of
Pendleton's resolution providing for a
junket to the institutions of the south
land. Senator Pendleton is noted as a
programmer, but after ail the strife
and bitter argument successfully hurl
ed against Junket measures during the
last week the oily smoothness with
whlcn to-day's resolution went through
astonished even its author.
When Senator Pendleton's resolution
was presented for the consideration of
the House Senator Wolfe. President pro
tern, who was in the chair, announced
that under his ruling of yesterday it
would take a two-thirds vote to pass
the measure. Then Senator Emmons
asked the privilege to explain his posi
tion. He was permitted to proceed
by the chair, though several of his col
leagues good naturedly objected.
"I have observed," said Senator Em
mons, "since I have been here this ses
sion that the men that stand foremost
in favor of junketing always come
back. Thh? is evidence to me that the
people no not object to such expendi
tures of public moneys and I am sure
that the committee proposed In the
resolution is an intelligent one and
that Its work will be well done. And
another point. I have several measures
here that I desire supported by my
associates in the Senate and conse
quently it is well that I be very friend
ly with the junketing plans. For these
reasons I want to say that I am in
favor of the resolution as presented."
RESOLUTION IS READ.
The resolution was then read to the
Senate, it being as follows:
Resolved. That Senator* Pendleton and Lu
kens. from the Committee on Finance; Senators
Woodward and Curtin, from the Committee on
Education; Senators Muenter and Markey. from
the Committee on Hospitals and Asylums; Sen
ators Welch and Coggtns, from the Committee
on Prisons and Reformatories; Senators Mc-
Kee and Nelson, from the Committee on Pub
lic Buildings and Grounds; Senator Bauer,
from the Committee on Commissions and Re
trench men;, and J. I*. Martin, sergeant at
arms of the Senate, be the committee named in
gursuanc- of the following resolution, adopted
y the Senate January 19, to-wlt:
Resolved, That the committees on Finance.
Education, Hospitals and Asylums, Prisons
and Reformatories and Public Buildings and
Grounds be authorized to Appoint a sub-com
mittee of two each and that said sub-commit
tee, together with the seigeant at arms of the
â easts, constitute a committee to visit such i
public institutions as they may deem necessary
In order that such institutions may be thor- ,
oughly inquired Into and reported upon to the I
Senate, and that they be allowed their actual j
expenses while engaged in committee work and
such leave of absence as may be hereinafter
determined by the Senate, and that said com- |
mlttee be and they are hereby granted leave of i
absence from Friday. January 27, to and lnclud- I
ing Wednesday, February 1. 1905. for the pur

technic School at San Luis Obispo and the |
State Hospital at Agnew*. and that said com- j
tnlttee bo and they are hereby allowed their j
expenses actually Incurred upon said rlsit.
The call for the vote developed a
unanimous sentiment in favor of the
resolution, and amid the smiles and !
laughter of the members it went slid
ing through, not, however, until after
Lukens had withdrawn in favor of
Raskins, Bauer in favor of Irish and
Curtin in favor of Sanford, whose

YOUNG MEX MUST WORK
Loafing Attaches Will Not
Be Tolerated, Declared the
Legislators, During Caucus
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SACRAMENTO, Jan. 20.âThere was
a warm time in the Senate caucus this
morning. The effort of Senator J. B.
Sanford of Ukiah, a Democrat, to se
cure the adoption of a resolution that
; would permit the light of public ap
proval, in relation to the Interstate
commerce bill, to be shifted from Pres
ident Roosevelt to Congressman Wil
liam R. Hearst, aroused the ire of the
Republican members of the upper
J house. They could see nothing in the
resolution but politics, and that of the
other faith, so Sanford's resolution was
no sooner read for discussion than the
debate grew torrid. The resolution that
precipitated the clash follows:
Senate joint resolution No. 4, relative to in
creasing the powers of the Interstate Commerce
Commission:
Whereas, The people of every Btate in this
Union, and the shippers of California in par
ticular, would be greatly benefited by having
the powers of the Interstate Commerce Com
mission increased; and.
Whereas, The President or the United States,
the Hon. Theodore Roosevelt, did in his mes
sage to Congress now in session recommend
that the powers cf said commission be ex
tended; therefore, be it Â«
Resolved by the Senate and Assembly of the
State of California, Jointly, that our Senators
In Congress be instructed and our Representa
tives therein be requested to vote for and use
all honorable means to secure the passage or
the Hearst interstate c< rnmerce bill.
Rsolved, That a copy of these resolution*
be forwarded to said .Senators and Representa
tives by the Secretary of the Senate. \
As it was apparent that Sanford's
resolution, If favorably reported by the
Committee on Federal Relations, of
which the author is a member, would
lead to strife on the floor it was the de
sire of all to avoid. Senators Irish and
Savage, the Republican members of
the committee, offered a substitute
from which the objectionable feature
of Sanford's resolution was omitted.
But Sanford, still anxious that his
theories, if not his praises, should be
included in the resolution to be adopt
ed, offered an amendment to his reso
lution, eliminating the name of Con
gressman Hearst.
After some discussion, the committee
being unable to agree upon the merits
of the resolution, and Sanford failing
to muster support for his measure, a
compromise was effected by which it
was agreed that the substitute resolu
tion of the committee and Sanford's
amended resolution should both be
printed in the journal, and the question
of the adoption of one or the other be
left to the Senate in general session. It
is said that the substitute resolution of
the committee wiH be the one adopted,
for it simply carries to the California
Congressional delegation the request
that it stand behind the President in
his effort to relieve the people from the
unjust exactions of railroads, and
pledges them to no specific legislative
policy.
After this question was disposed of
the caucus took up another question,
which, though it is of less moment to
all the people of the State than is the
interstate commerce bill, is of im
measurably more importance to some.
These latter are the young men that
have obtained appointment as attaches
of the Senate, but who refuse to work.
There has been some complaint of the
delay in handling the mass of work re
turning daily to the bill-filing room. A
few men, all of them of advanced
years, have been compelled to do this
work, while some scores of younger
attaches have enjoyed freedom from
labor.
The caucus, aftÂ«*r discussing the sit
uation, not without some display of
anger, decided that the opening of the
new week shall see a change in condi
tions, it was agreed that the young
men that are enjoying positions as at
taches shall be summoned and In
structed that they must go to work.
Those that refuse wijl be dismissed and
others that will work appointed in their
places.
FAIL IN AN ATTEMPT

Bandits Derail It, but It Does Not

as Planned.
DES MOINES, lowa, Jan. 20.âAn
unsuccessful attempt was made to-day
to wreck an early Fort Dcs Moines
car, supposed to carry Government
cash to meet the post pay roll. An
open switch on a high grade threw the
car from the rail and it was barely
prevented from plunging down the
high embankment. Ida Stewart, a
ncgress. was the only passenger. She
was severely injured.
It is believed to have been the plan
of the bandits to caase the car to
plunge over the embankment. When
this failed they disappeared without
attempting to loot the contents.

Special Dispatch to The CaiL
SACRAMENTO, Jan, 20â Thirteen
more attaches, including porters, com
mittee clerks and stenographers, with
salaries ranging from $3 to $5 a day,
were added to the Assembly payroll
this morning after a debate that be
came heated, a call of the House and a
ballot that carried the resolution by but
one vote, under the two-third rule.
Directly after placing this new bunch
of attaches on the roll the Assembly
turned down with a thud a resolution
to still further increase the number of
attaches, and it seems likely that the
last person who Is to fatten off the
public treasury this session, as far as
the lower house is concerned, has been
appointed. Men who have steadily
voted for such attaches said after ad
journment that a limit had been
reached and that no threats of oppo
sition to bills and no pleas would in
duce them to vote aye for any more
patronage resolutions.
Waste of Alameda led the opposition
and was supported by Olmsted, Drew
and Coyle. There was an exchange of
fiery verbal shots between Coghlan of
San Francisco and Waste of Berkeley.
Waste talked of "foisting useless em
ployes on the House," and said such
action was an imposition on the mi
nority, which had agreed upon $10 a
day as the limit of patronage.
Coghlan said that the Berkeley rep
resentative had no right to impeach
the honesty of the majority. It rep
resented the people in their desire to be
well served and represented the Assem
bly in its desire to serve the people.
California is a rich State, Coghlan said,
and there was no reason why every
member of the Assembly should not
have all the help he needed.
RBKOLLTTON ADOPTED.
The first ballot developed that the
resolution lacked two votes of the
necessary two-thirds. A call of the
House was demanded and a few ab
sentees gathered in, with the result
that the resolution was .adopted by a
vote of 48 to 28.
Right on top of this Pfaeffle of San
Francisco introduced a resolution call
ing for the appointment of more hired
men. The Speaker said if there was no
objection it would go to the Committee
on Attaches.
"I move, Mr. Speaker, said Stanton,
with some warmth, "that we postpone
action on this resolution indefinitely. I
have voted for the appointment of at
taches in the past, but I give notice
that 1 am done and that no future res
olution of this sort shall receive mv
vote. We have enough attaches now."
No one had the nerve to stand for the
resolution and it was Indefinitely post
poned as suggested. Other members
who had voted for the previous one
arose and said they would stand for
no more of that nature, and it looks
as if the jig was up for the remaining
aspirants for easy jobs in the Assem- j
bly.
It took a fight to adjourn the Assem
bly over from to-day until Memdav. but
it was finally accomplished after it
had been practically beaten, but with
the understanding that hereafter Sat- j
urday sessions would be held. Atkin- !
son's motion to adjourn till Monday!
was opposed by Houser, who said that \
the Assembly was now a week behind |
in its work.
DEVLIN BEFRIENDS LEACH. '|
Devlin of Solano introduced a joint |
resolution calling upon the California ,
delegation in Congress to use every ef- I
fort to have passed a bill now in the
national legislature appropriating $25,
--000 for the relief of Frank A. Leach,
Superintendent of the San Francisco
Mint, who had to sacrifice his home In
Oakland to help make good the steal
ings of Dimmick, the late cashier of the
Mint. The resolution was unanimously
adopted.
Coghlan introduced a resolution pro
viding for a Junket of the Charities and
Corrections Committee to the various
institutions under its jurisdiction. The
resolution was referred to the Commit
tee on Rules.
The Committee on Public Lands and
Forestry reported back the bill for the
recession of the Yosemite Valley with
a recommendation that it pass. One
member, Jones of Tuolumne, filed a mi
nority report opposing the bill.
Among the interesting bills intro
duced to-day was one by Pryor for the
protection of oil producers. It is de
signed to compel railroad companies to
supply tank cars when required.
Waste submitted a bill providing for
the putting under bonds of all compa
nies and corporations selling invest
ment certificates or investment con
tracts, and McGowan introduced still
another measure to regulate debenture
and tontine companies. It provides that
all such companies shall deposit with
the State Treasurer a sum equal to the
alleged value of all the bonds they
issue.
Slavin took the initial step toward es
tablishing aiprofitable Industry by in
troducing a bounty of $2 on coyote
scalps.
It was announced that the Commit
tee on Public Buildings and Grounds
would start Monday on its trip of in
vestigation, taking in San Jose, Santa
Cruz, Los Angeles and San Diego. It
will be gone about a week. The Com
mittee on Commerce and Navigation
will start to-morrow for San Pedro.
A resolution of sympathy for Assem
blyman Weyand, whose mother died
yesterday morning, was adopted and
ordered telegraphed to him.

INDIAN CHIEFS
ISSUE EDICT
Heads of Tribes of Alaska
Declare There Shall Be No
Potlatches or Big Feasts
Special Dispatch to The Call.
TACOMA, Jan. 20.âThe edict has
gone forth that there shall be no more
potlatches among the Indians of
Southeastern Alaska. The decision was
reached by a council held at Sitka, at
which were present the heads of all the
clans of the Thlinket Indians, who in
habit the shores of Southeastern
Alaska. The council took place Just
after the close of a potlatch given by
four big chiefs, which continued more
than five weeks and was the greatest
affair of the kind that has ever taken
place in Alaska.
After the last dance and last feast,
after the last vestige of the wealth the
big chiefs had been years in accumulat
ing had been given away, they assem
bled their tribesmen and declared that
in future there shall be no more pot
latches, no more tribal dances, and no
more feasting; that hereafter Indians
shall abstain from further observance
of the old tribal customs, and that they
accept the religion of Christianity and
adopt the mode of life and customs of
the white race.

KERENS GAINS
THREE VOTES
He Tries to Persuade Nied
ringhaus to Stand Aside
j in the Senatorial Fight
JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., Jan. 20.â
The fourth ballot for United States
Senator to succeed Francis M. Cock
rell, taken by the Legislature to-day
in joint session, resulted in no election.
The vote stood: Francis M. Cockrell
81, T. K. Niedrir?haus 80, R. C. Kerens
9, Pettijohn 1. Necessary to a choice
84.
Niedringhaus lost one more vote to
day, which went to Kerens. Two men,
who yesterday voted for Pettijohn, to
day went to Kerensâ
Before the balloting began to-day
Colonel R. C. Kerens, who started the
recent bolt against Thomas K. Nie<Jv
ringhaus, the Republican caucus nom
inee, held a fifteen minutes' conference
with Niedringhaus.
Kerens told Niedringhaus that he
claimed precedence for Senatorial hon
ors" on account of his service to the
party and his long years of waiting.
"I would be willing to give up the
Senatorship if I had your youth," said
Kerens to Nie.lringhaus, adding that
he thought the caucus nominee could
afford to wart. Niedringhaus smiled !
pleasantly at the comments of Kerens \
and the best of feeling apparently pre- j
vailed. Later Mr. Niedringhaus said,
that the meeting was personal and not i
for the purpose of breaking the dead- I
lock.
"I am practically United States Sen
ator from Missouri now," he said, !
"barring a little formality in the joint!
session."

SPRING TRADE
RATHER QUIET
Progress Is More Eapid in
Manufacture-Than in the
Distribution of Products
NEW YORK, Jan. 20.âBradstreet's
I to-morrow^*ili,say:
Industry still maintains a position of
â  pre-eminent activity, while distributive
I trade for spring, not as yet fully
! opened, 'lacks definite form in some
j lines. Lumber is strong at higher
j prices than last year.
With the exception of the South and
1 portions of the Southwest, where lower
prjced cotton affects collections and
clouds the future, the feeling is one of
great confidence in the future and par
ticularly as to the ensuing year's busi
ness. Collections are irregular, being
best in the Northwest and Central
West, and poorest in the South, where
low cotton prices depress trade.
Iron, and steel in Its cruder forms
have been rather quieter this week and
the winter edge of demand being taken
off, foundry iron and Bessemer pig
have been shaded in price.
Early predictions of a small gain in
gross railroad earnings for the year
1904 over 1903, the best hitherto report
ed, confirmed by reports to Brad
street's, are a fraction of 1 per cent
increase for the last twelve months.
December gross receipts show a gain
of 1 per cent over 1903, but for the first
half of January the increase is con
siderably smaller than last year.
Failures in the United States for the
week ending January 19, numbered 304,
against 295 last week, and 266 last year.
In Canada failures for the week num
ber 37, as against 24 last week, and 25
last year.
Wheat (including flour) exports for
the week ending January 19 are 1,138,
--974 bushels, against 700,950 last week
and 8,588,592 last year.
From July 1 to date the exports are
38,010,186 bushels, against 95,829,515 last
year.
Dun's weekly review of trade will say
to-morrow:
Progress is more rapid in manufacture
than in distribution, which is largely
due to the weather at some points and
the unsettled feeling in the South,
where the collapse of cotton prices has
netarded collections and caused many
cancellations. That production is main
tained by mills and furnaces may be
taken as evidence of confidence in the
future. Settlement of the protracted
labor struggle at Fall River is encour
aging, but the industrial atmosphere is
disturbed elsewhere, although on the
whole there is less than the customary
idleness for this season. Railway earn
ings for January thus .far show a gain
of 2.3 per cent. Foreign commerce at
this port is also better than a year
ago, the last week showing gains of
$1,555,889 in value of imports and $292,
--936 in exports.
Hides are- still firm as a rule, except
that some declines are recorded on
packer natives, as these constitute the
bulk of current receipts.
Failures this week number 335 in the
United States, against SSB last year, and
24 in Canada, compared with. 33 a year
ago.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 21, 1905.
Consul General
Denies Curtis'
Charges.
ENGLISH COUPLE AND AMERI
CAN OFFICIAL WHO ARRIVED
ON THE MANCHURIA.
Two notabje persons were among the
passengers arriving from the Orient
yesterday on the steamship Manchu
ria. One was Hon. John Goodnow,
United States Consul General at Shang
hai, who is going to Washington to
face charges recently made against him
by a lawyer named Curtis, and the
other distinguished visitor was Sir
Francis Pakenham, K. C. M. G., Min
ister Plenipotentiary and Envoy Ex
traordinary of Great Britain to Swe
den, who is on his way around the
world. Lady Pakenham is with her
husband. All are guests at the Palace.
Consul General Goodnow, referring to
the recent accusations of irregularities
made against him by Curtis, said last
evening thai he was prepared to refute
them. Connnuing, he said:
I am not in a position to fully discuss my
cas c until I have' presented myself to the
Washington authorities. As Consul General at
Shanghai I hold a position similar to that of
a Judge, and I have rendered decisions which
apparently have not pleased lawyers who were
Interested in the outcome of the cases and
they have seen fit to carry the matter to a
higher authority. I am prepared to refute
the charges that have been filed in Washing
ton.
Consul General Goodnow, after rest
ing here for several days, will go to
Chicago and from there to Ann Arbor,
where his son is attending college. La
ter he will visit Washington. Several
of Goodnow's traveling companions on
the Manchuria, who are thoroughly ac
quainted with the charges brought
against him, declare that he has been
spitefully maligned, and Is carrying
with him to Washington ample evi
dence to prove this fact. .
Sir Francis Pakenham is the sev
enth son of the Earl of Langford and
has represented the British Govern
ment in twenty-two different capitals
of the world. He is a descendant of
General Pakenham, who was defeated
by General Jackson at New Orleans.
Lady Pakenham accompanies her hus
band on his present trip, which will in
clude a tour of this country before
they go to Australia.

THEATER INJUNCTION SUIT
NOT READY FOR HEARING
District Attorney Says Police Still
Have Right to Arrest Violators
of Ordinance.
District Attorney Byington, Fore
man T. P. Andrews of the Grand Jury
and E. J. Bowes of the committee
which inspected the theaters were in
Judge Seawell's court yesterday, but
failed to get a hearing on the order to
show cause why the Board of Works
and Chief of Police should not be. en
joined from closing certain vaudeville
houses. Julius Kahn, representing the
Baldwin, was.absent; the City Attor
ney's office was not prepared to go on
with the cases in behalf of the Board
of Works and H. C. McPike pleaded
for a week's continuance for the
Unique and Novelty theaters.
McPike promised to prove that the
ordinance under which it wag at
tempted to close the amusement places
was Invalid because its provisions
could not be enforced. Byington de
clared it was not impossible to enforce
the provision that a theater should not
be conducted under a lodging-house,
adding that the Unique and Novelty
were proceeded against because they
had not paid license fees. Byington
filed affidavits covering the imperfec
tions of the houses in the way of fire
protection and otherwise.
When the court announced it would
continue the matter for . a week the
District Attorney said he did not con
sider that the restraining order could
prevent arrests for the violation of or
dinances and Judge Seawell said it was
not so* Intended. The arrest of the
proprietors of the three houses will
doubtless follow.

COIN GOES INTO
MINE PLANTS.
Recent Discoveries Revive Interest
Northern Camps Increase Outfit
and Prepare for Season.
The mining news of the week is note
worthy mainly for the extensions and
improvements reported. Unusual in
terest is shown in Siskiyou County,
which is attracting the investment of
considerable outside capital. A large
company has been formed to mine in
the mountains of Siskiyou. A strike
made on Cherry Creek is deemed of
great importance. In the Humbug dis
trict the Mono mine is runifing at its
fullest capacity. The Medina Mining
I Company has put in new machinery. A
large dredger will resume work near
' Hawkinsville. Placer mining will be
1 resumed on Garvey bar in the Klamath
River.
At the Zeibright mine in Nevada
County a twenty-stamp mill will soon
be running. Lewis H. Eddy, field as
sistant of the State Mining Bureau,
who has been traveling through the
north, says that in the North Bloom
field district drift mining is active.
The Union Blue and the Malakoff
properties are working at North
Bloomheld. The gravel channel is re
ported to have been struck, says the
Miner-Transcript, in the Grass Valley
district in the Auriferous mine. The
gravel channel is frum 100 to 200 feet
wide. To tap this it was necessary to
run a tunnei through the hardest rock
at high cost for every foot that was
driven. "The find," says the Miner
Transcript, "brings the country in
which the Auriferous is situated again
to the front as valuable mining terri
tory."
The Treadwell mine in Amador Coun
ty, which has been closed some months,
is again in operation. In Calaveras
County development work is under way
in the Hendrick mine and on gravel
property on Calaveritas road; also on
properties in the San Andreas channel.
It is announced that the American
Magnesite Company has arranged to
haul raw material to Ldvermore and
ship it to Oakland, where it will be cal
cined. Snow in the mountains impedes
travel and interferes with operations in
many parts of the State at this time.
Mining men in all sections report that
the outlook is good for the coming sea
son.
IN THE SOUTHWEST.
According to A. Richardson, editor of
the Los Angeles Mining Review, the
value of minerals produced in Southern
California in 1904 was $12,147,500. Rich
ardson says of the southern production
of minerals in 1904:
For 1904 the value of Southern California's
mineral production may be estimated at $12,
--147,600. If to that amount there be added
the value of Arizona's gold, silver, lead and
copper production for IÂ»U4, estimated by the
Ge\ernor of Arisona at $37,750,000, and add
to thai the gold production of Southern Ne
vada, tributary to Los Angeles, you have a
total mineral production for this southwestern
region last year of $53,397,500. Nor does that
include such proportion of the gold, silver
anu copper output of the State of Bonora and
oÂ£ Lower Calitornla, in Mexico, as might be
pruperly included In the mineral production of
this southwestern regiun. inasmuch as a con
siderable proportion of the value of such out
put comes to Los Angeles In settlement of
machinery and mine supplies.
Kern County continues to hold first place
as a gold producer in Southern California,
with San Diego second and San Bernardino
third. The two principal camps of Kern
County are Randsburg and Mojave. In the
former the Yellow Aster mine is the largest
producer, the next being the Butte Lode.
In San Diego County the Golden Cross mines
at Hedges continue to hold first place,, not
withstanding all the litigation they have gone
through. Their production for the year has
been about $140,000, which might be very
considerably increased. The California King
gold mine, in the Plcacho district, is another
of San Diego's properties that had its full
share of legal trouble during the last year.
The property is one of great extent, welt
equipped, and with a fine mill and evanlde
plant on the Colorado River, the mines and
nuli being connected by a railway belonging
to the California King Gold Mines Company.
San Bernardino County well maintained Its
reputation as next In rank as a mineral pro
ducer to Kern County, If petroleum is not in
cluded, in which case it would come after
Los Angeles County. San Bernardino has no
important petroleum producers, its mineral
production being chiefly confined to gold, cop
per, silver, borax and cement, of which It
produced last year an estimated value of
$1,400,000. Its principal gold and copper de
ports are In the New York Mountains, Victor
district and Ludlow district.
The Mining Review estimates that
the copper output of Arizona this year
will amount to 303,000,000 pounds. Gov
ernor Brodie has reported the total
copper production of the territory in
1904 at 230,000,000 pounds. An Increased
production, as estimated, is based in
part on the improvement in reduction
plants.
ALASKAN QUARTZ BELT.
The claim is made that a great
quartz belt, extending from seventy
five miles southeast of Juneau V Noweil
City, seventy miles northwest of
Juneau, has been traced. The Record
Miner says that quarts in place has
been followed to Sumdum, where there
are low grade mines at work. The belt
is cut at Snettisham Bay and at Takou
harbor. In part the Record Miner re
ports as follows:
The country between Windham and Takou
harbor la covered with moss underbrush anl
devil clubs and Is very thickly timbered, pre
venting the rapid development of the section.
North of here many locations have been made
as far as Sheep Creek, the next point where
active mining operations are being carried
on, four and a half miles southeast of Ju
neau. A thirty-stamp mill is in operation.
At the head of Gokf Creek, which empties'
into Oastineeu Channel one-half mile north
west of Juneau, In the Last Chance and Silver
Bow basins, the Alaska Perseverance Mining
Company, adjoining the Sheep Creek property
on the northwest and the Groundhog group,
owned by the Nowell Company, are being
developed.
The Alnska-Juneau Company, one of the
associate companies of the Tread well manage
ment, has a forty-five-stamp mill and has two
crosscuts. 800 feet part, which show 1200 to
1400 feet In width of pay ore. Nearer Juneau
the Ebner Gold Mining Company have had a
fifteen-stamp mill operating for nine years.
Adjoining the Ebner property on the north
west is the Humboldt group, on which a ten
stamp mill Is built. From Sheep Creek to the
Humboldt claims the mineral belt is unbroken
and is from 500 to 1400 feet In width, being
covered with many locations.
Opposite Juneau, on Douglas Island, are
the four groups of the Treadwell mines, own
ed by the Alaska-Treadwell Gold Mining Com
pany; the Seven Hundred and Ready Bullion
mines, owned by the United Gold Mining Com
pany, and the Mexican, owned by the Alaska-
Mexican Gold Mining Company. On Lemon
Creek, four and a half miles northwest of
Juneau, the Lemon Creek Company Is hy
draulicking. Between the Ebner and Lemon
Creek groups a number of prospects have been
discovered. Twelve miles northwest from
Juneau the Montana Creek or Montana Basin
group ef properties are ten miles farther from
salt water. At Tee .Harbor, twenty miles
northwest from Juneau, the mining gone Is
six miles from salt water. One group of
claims at that point was recently bonded for
$60,000.
The Eagle River Mining Company, on Eagle
River, twenty-five miles from Juneau, with
B. L. Thane as superintendent, has a twenty
stamp mill. At Yankee Cove, five miles north
"West qf the Eagle River mines, the Alaska-
Washington Gold Mining Company has eight
claims adjoining the Bessie properties, owned
by the Shelton syndicate. Berners Bay la a
large Indentation of the coast, cutting the
mineral belt fifty-five miles northwest of Ju
neau. Many location* have been made In the
vicinity. The Jualln has a alxteen-stamp mill
and has yielded $800,000, but the management
was compelled to shut down last year because
of a flow of water. Large pumps will have
to be Installed to handle the flow, and this
will probably be done during the coming sea
son. At Nowell City, seventy-five miles north
west of Juneau, the Kensington mines have
been bonded by the Nowells to J. McDonald,
I formerly superintendent of the TreadwsU
mines, for over $1,000,000.
STUDY OF CRIPPLE CREEK.
Waldemar Lindgren of the United
States Geological Survey has made an
interesting study of the Cripple Creek
district in Colorado. He reports, on
the basis of mint figures, that the dis
trict hag, including 1891, produced
$124,000,000 in gold and $646,000 in silver.
The dividends declared, says Lindgren,
amounted to $32,000,000 to the end of
1&03. Some of Lindgren's statements
follow:
At the present time there are about 800
mines In the district, though many of these are
idle and others are consolidated into larger
properties. The number of shafts 1000 feet or
more in depth is about 22; of these the Llllie
is the deepest, having attained 1500 feet. Com
paratively few of the mines are pumping, the
district being drained by tunnels. The mo
live power for hoisting is ordinarily steam,
electric power being used only In smaller
shafts. The mining methods employed present
new features of particular interest. The width
stoped ranges from 3 to 50 feet or more. The
stopes are sometimes filled, but are often left
open after the broken rock between levels has
been drawn off. Operations are facilitated by
the great hardness of the rock, stopes 200 feet
or more In height sometimes standing for years.
To an annual production of $18,000,000 (19Â»Â»0)
corresponded a maximum output of about 600,000
tons. The ores are not adapted to concentrat
ing by ordinary means. Hand sorting and
washing, the latter in order to separate the
fines, are the methods employed. More care is
now taken than formerly, but at many places
there Is still room for Improvement.
The district contains many large mines oper.
ated by strong companies, bat the system of
leasing to individuals and small companies,
with royalty charges of 15 to 25 per cent of the
not output, remains a conspicuous feature.
At the present time the mines of the north
western ana northeastern parts of the district
are only slightly productive. Among the for
merly high productive mine* in this section
may be mentioned the Victor Isabella, Wild
Horse, Damon, Logan, Orpha May. Pharmacist,
C. O. P., Gold King and Anehoria-Leland.
The southwest quarter or the district con
tains the active and important Â£1 Paso, Mary
McKinney and Klkton mines, but the maximum
output during the last few years has come from
the southeastern portion, within which are the
Portland. Gold Coin. AJax, Strong, Golden Cy
cle, Vindicator and Last Dollar mines. The
Portland mine has for some time been the
heaviest producer in tonnage as welt as in
value. Its output is from CO,OOO to 90,000 tons
per annum. In 1903 this mine produced $2,-

with having sold out to the operators
during the recent Colorado strike, was
expelled from the organization to-day
by the national convention.
Randall took the floor and made a
statement, which was marked by an
absence of the abuse of President
Mitchell which he used yesterday. Pres
ident Mitchell replied to him and de
manded that either himself or Randall
should not be in the convention. In his
statement President Mitchell said:
This man Randall says that my accusation I
that he made false statements In his local
union forced him to his attack. If anything
were needed to prove his duplicity that state- j
n,ent does it. Brother Randall, you should
not have come here; you could have lied more
successfully from Diets, Wyo. The president
oi' your district has said he does not
a word you have said. If one charge that this ,
delegate makes is true I am unfit to occupy j
the place I do. I should be deposed. If ;
tii<Â» charges are not true I have a right to !
protection. Either this man or I should not I
be here. One of us should leave this con- j
vertlon. I leave it for the delegates to say
which it shall be. /
Delegate Walker of Illinois, floor
leader of the Socialists in the organisa
tion, then presented the following res
olution, which was adopted by a unani
mous vote:
Whereas, By a gross misrepresentation of
facts in connection with the Colorado strike,
together with a torrent of abuse and a tissue
of false and lyjng statements. Delegate Ran
dall has assailed the character, personality
and integrity of President John Mitobell and
other national officers, not one word of which
hu has in any manner substantiated; therefor*
be it
Resolved. That this convention express its
full confidence in the honesty and Integrity of
our national officers and fully indorse their
action In connection with the Colorado strike
and that Delegate Robert Randall make a
public retraction on the floor of this conven
tion of his unwarranted attack on the officers
of this organisation or stand suspended from
the convention and expelled from the United
Mine Workers of America until such time
a? he shall make such public retraction and
that the secretary of the local be so notified.
Delegate Randall arose and standing
at his seat refused to retract and
walked from the convention.
The convention adopted several res- 1
3lutions, all aimed at having mining
wage contracts expire on March 31, ;
1906.
Given Raise in Wages.
PITTSBURG, Jan. *0. âAnnounce-
ment was made to-day at the Schoen
ville plant of the Pressed Steel Car
Company that the wages of the em
ployes in all departments had been
advanced 10 per cent, the Increase to
date from the first day of the new
year. Five hundred are affected.
EPPINGER TRUSTEE WANTS
GRAIN FOR ALL CREDITORS
Asks Permission to File Answer and
Cross-Complaint in Bank Suit
Now on Trial.
In the bank squabble over the Ep
pinger grain, now on trial in Judge
Murasky's court, a new phase was
added yesterday when Attorney J. C.
McKinstry asked permission to file an
answer and cross-complaint in behalf
of Henry Wadsworth, the Eppingers'
trustee in bankruptcy. The cross-com
plaint demands that the 1102,000 re
ceived from the sale of the 3500 tons
of grain In the warehouse at Crockett
be turned over to the trustee for the
benefit of all the Eppinger creditors
instead of being divided among the
banks that held warehouse receipts as
security. This means that the money
shall be applied to $1,200,000 of debts
instead of to the $700,000 claimed by
the banks.
Mr. McKinstry contends that if the
grain had been commingled it was im
possible to identify it as security for
any specific loan and therefore it be
longed to all the creditors. He further
argued that the warehouse receipts j
were not valid evidences of security
because they had not been authorita
tively signed; they bore the signatures
of the vice president and "acting sec
retary" of the warehouse company and
Mr. McKinstry said that there was no
such office as "acting secretary," that
the man owned no stock in the com
pany and was merely an employe of
the Eppingers.
T. C. Van Ness, who represents one
of the banks claiming individual lots
of grain under the receipts held, op
posed the trustee and contended that
even if the grain could not be iden
tified the whole amount was still the
property of the banks as a security for
loans.
Judge Murasky took the matter un
der advisement.

CALIFORNIA IDEA IS NEW
Episcopal Convention Attracts
Widespread Attention.
The annual convention of the Epis
copal church in the diocese of Cali
fornia meets in Grace Church on next
Tuesday morning. The opening ser
vice will commence at 10:30 with cel
ebration of the holy eucharist. Ser
mon will be preached by the Bishop
.of California. At the close of the ser
vice the convention will organize and
proceed to business.
On Tuesday evening a grand mis
sionary mass meeting will be held in
Trinity Church, corner of Bush and
Gough streets. Music will be fur
nished by the vested choirs of St.
Ltike's. Advent and St. John's, San
â¢Francisco, and St. John's, Oakland.
Addresses will be delivered by Rev.
David Evans of Grace Church, Rev.
Burr M. Weeden, St. Luke's; George
E. Butler and the Bishop. Wednes
day will be given to general business,
with missionary meeting and elections
for diocesan officers. Thursday, busi
ness of the convention, with a recep
tion to Bishop and Mrs. Nichols at
the St. Francis Hotel in the evening.
Friday a meeting of the Women's
Auxiliary will be held at SL Luke's
Church at 11 o'clock. Rev. C. T.
Walkley of St. Paul's Church, Oak
land, will be the preacher.
The business of organizing the house
of churchwomen is expected to fur
nish some episodes of the convention
â¢of a sensational nature. On consti
tutional grounds women were exclud
ed from membership in the conven
â¢ tion proper, but were promised in
stead a separate organization, in
which their influence upon church
legislation could be made effective. It
is understood that a certain element
of the women in the church are averse
to being sidetracked. A very lively
debate is expected to follow the report
of the committee having the designa
tion of the powers of the new house
and the presentation of new canons
Which the act will necessitate. The
â difficulty to be met is great, as there
is no precedent to guide. No other
Jurisdiction in the United States has
anything like the organisation pro
posed, which throughout the country
is called "the new California Idea."
The discussion of plans for church
extension and finance is expected to
be extremely rigorous. The interest
In new legislation throughout the dio
cese is great and a large attendance
of the churches is expected. The fol
lowing persons have been elected del

PARK MANAGERS
AT THE LODGE
A. B. Spreekels Is Ke-elected
to the Presidency of
Board of Commissioners
METSON IS INSTALLED
*
Mayor Schmitz Gives His
Views Concerning; Affairs
of 'Official Management
The Board of Park Commissioners
met yesterday afternoon at the Park
Lodge, Reuben H. Lloyd presiding, and
effected annual organization by the re
election of A. B. Spreekels president.
William H. Metson, who was recently
appointed to fill the vacancy caused by
the expiration of the term of Frank J.
Sullivan, presented his commission.
John McLaren, superintendent, and
James de Succa, secretary, were re
elected. All the Commissioners, except
ing A. B. Spreekels, who was out of
town, attended the session. Mayor
Schmitz came in shortly after the
, meeting was called to order and re
mained until adjournment. Referring
to Mr. Metson's appointment, the May
or said he felt sure that the new Com
missioner would be of service to the
park and work harmoniously with his
fellow Commissioners. The Mayor
spoke of the lack of complete harmony
i in the past, and referred directly to the
opposition of certain members of the
| commission to the Dutch windmill. He
said: "The two Commissioners who
planned and carried out this success
tul enterprise, which has done so much
tor Golden Gate Park, were accused at
one time of misusing the public
money."
I Commissioner Metson said he would
endeavor to perform his duty and work
in harmony with the board for the good
of the park.
Commissioner Lloyd paid tribute to
I Mr. Metson's former service as Park
| Commissioner. The president, superin
! tendent and secretary were unanimous
!ly re-elected, the motion in each in
| stance being made by Commissioner
Dingee.
j W. M. Troutt listened to a lecture
1 from Commissioner Lloyd on the neces
, sity of obeying the park ordinance rela-
I tive to speed on the reservation. Mr.
, Troutt admitted that he "speeded up"
; a little to gain the hill, but on a prom
| ise to go slow in the future his per
i mit was restored. The Commissioner
i said: "We will overlook the offense
this time. Next time no excuse will be
accepted."
Arthur Hull was told that the auto
mobile men must respect the ordi
\ nances. Explanation developed the
\ statement that A. H. Ashe took Hull's
demonstrating car without the former's
I consent, hence all the trouble. Mr.
I Ashe explained that he was a stranger
j from New York. On December 27 he
passed examination and was accorded
! a permit to run a machine for Colonal
j Preston. He did not understand that
! he was obliged to carry the permit. He
! got his permit on promise to obey.
Richard E. Follett, manager and di
j rector of exhibits of the Pacific Coast
j Forest and Game Association, told the
Commissioners that the association
; proposed to convert the main floor of
; the Mechanics' Pavilion into a forest of
' pine, fir, cedar, cypress and spruce, and
\ there would be gathered elk, deer.
: moose, antelope, beaver, birds and
I fishes. "He fancied that four elk of the
| park herd would-lend enchantment to
, the woodland. The manager said he
! could transfer the elk in a furniture
| van from the park to the forest in the
I pavilion. He promised in exchange for
i the loan of the elk to give the park
, two antelopes, several wood ducks, a
'. moose and a beaver. The proceeds of the
i exhibition are to go to charitable so
j cietiets. â¢ The purpose of the exposition
jas outlined by Mr. Follett is to awaken
; public interest on the subject of pre-
I serving forests and game. The exhibi
! tion is to open during the
â  last week of March. On motion of Com
\ missioner Metson, seconded by Com
missioner Cummings, the request for
i loan of the elks was Â«""anted.
Out qf a bunch of twelve large horses
i five were conditionally accepted by
j Commissioner Dingee, after getting the
! views of Dr. Egan and John McLaren.
llf the horses stand the test of work
! for three days the board will take them
i at $225 each.

An Eastern Expert Wilt Demonstrate the
Famous "Block Light" To-Day*
Saturday an expert sent from the Eastern factory of the Block Light Company will be in our
store from 8:30 in the morning until 10 o'clock in the evening to instruct purchasers in the regula
tion and installation of these lights, so that the very best results can be obtained.
The Block Light is the nearest to perfection yet produced. Its simplicity is marvelous
and its brilliancy really wonderful. It may be instantly attached to any gas jet. Every Block Light
is guaranteed to produce, with a single mantle, a light equal to 300 candle power, using eight
parts of air'io one of gas.
The latter feature is accomplished by a novel and scientific method of combining the two
elements and producing perfect combustion. Patented adjustments permit the gas to pass through
a fine gauze, breaking itlnto particles and mixing it with air. Thus it is possible to save at least one
half your gas bill, and at the same time secure a light that gives a soothing radiance.

AN AMENDMENT
I Proposition for Leasing of
City Property Is to Be
Changed Before Submitted
One of the proposed charter amend
ments which the Board of Supervisors
decided some time ago to submit to a
vote of the people at the next general
election will be itself amended before
its submission. The amendment in its
present shape provides for the lease of
land belonging to the city for a period
of fifty years, on condition that a
building equal to the value of the land
]be erected on the site.
The amendment is designed to secure
a favorable lease of the Lincoln School
1 property, at the corner of Fifth and
Market streets, as it would not prove
profitable to a lessee to lease the prop
erty for a shorter period.
Supervisor Braunhart, a member of
the Committee on Charter Amend
: ments, who introduced the amend
ment, has been prosecutingy inquiries,
and has arrived at the conclusion that
the condition that a building equal to
the value of the Lincoln School lot
might prevent an advantageous lease
thereof.
Braunhart ascertained, yesterday that
the value of the lot described is $2,500,
--000, and under- his amendment It would
require the erection of a building worth
the same amount by the leaseholder.
He now believes that a building worth
11,600,000 would be sufficiently elabo
rate and would facilitate the granting
of a lease.
Braunhart therefore has decided to
change his amendment, so as to re
quire the erection of a building of the
value of 60 per cent of the valuation
of the lot to be leased by the city, in
stead of one costing, as much as the
value of the lot itself. N He believes that
a structure costing a million and a half
; would be an ornament to the section
of the city in which the lot is located,
and, to quote his own words, "a build
ing costing 11,500,000 would stand for a
century."
It will be a long time before the pro
visions of the amendment can be car
ried out, as the present lease does not
expire for several years.
O'Connell Makes Appeal.
Bernard Daniel O'Connell,, the at
! torney whose record in Lowell, Mass.,
: is being investigated by the San Fran

i a victim of political and religious per

O'Connell was sentenced to six
months' imprisonment at Lowell oh
the charge of being an accessory be
fore the fact to the bribing of a pub
lic official. The appeal made by
O'Connell yesterday was listened to
with rapt attention by the members

BRIEF QUERIES
FOR DRINKHOUSE
Grand Jurors Inquire Into
Detailing of Policemen
on the Chinatown Squad
Police Commissioner Drinkhouse was
before the Grand Jury yesterday to ex
plain seme ugly rumors charging him
with exerting his influence with Chief
Wlttman to have favorite patrolmen
assigned to beats in Chinatown. He de
nied making any discreditable requests
of the head of the department, and
when he emerged from the Jury-room
he declared that "the matter did not
amount to anything."
The Commissioner was brought into
the investigation because the Grand
Jury had been Informed that there was
much striving to have Policemen Hen
ry M. Heinz and R. R. O'Brien placed
on the Chinatown squad. They are the
patrolmen who admitted that they had
accepted money from the agents of the
fantan and lottery games.
Frank 1. Farris. who does a sort of
brokerage business about the Police
courts in furnishing bail for prisoners,
was also a witness yesterday. He was
asked if he ever tried to use his influ
ence to have any patrolmen detailed
to the Chinatown squad, but his answer
was an emphatic denial. He also said
it was untrue that he sought the aid
of Commissioner Drinkhouse for such
a purpose.
APPROACHED DRINKHOUSE.
"Did you ever approach Commission
er Drinkhouse with a request to have
Heinz's beat changed 7" queried Juror
Bowes.
"Yes, I asked him if he could not in
fluence the Chief to afasign Heinz to a
beat on Third street," was the answer.
Sut Drinkhouse had said the removal
would be impossible.
"Why didn't you tell us about this
when you were before the police com
mittee of the Grand Jury?" asked
Bowes warmly.
"I did tell you about it, and you w ill
find it In your record."
Bowes took issue warmly, but when
the stenographer produced her notes It
was found that Farris had not with
held the information from the commit
tee. 1
Registrar George P. Adams, against
whom the Grand, Jury has been seeking
evidence, was subpenaed to bring with
him the affidavits of registration for
the -Twenty-eighth, Thirty-eighth,
Thirty ninth and Forty-fourth Assem
bly districts. He was simply asked to
identify the papers he brought and
then excused. The jurors will probe
deeper into the election frauds if the
stupendous labors they have mapped
out â¢ for themselves do not tax their
energy and enthusiasm too much. Their
enthusiasm is already on the wane.
JUROR XEWHALL KEEPS AWAY.
Gecrge A. Newhall, one of the mem
bers of the inquisitorial body, is said
to have become wi-aried of the job of
investigation. He keeps aloof from his
fellow Jurors and has been absent from
several meetings. He Is said to have
tMken exception to the methods of con
ducting* the lurv's affairs and particu
larly to the fact that Foreman Andrews
and E. J. Bowes are taking matters
very much into their own hands.
An' indictment was returned yester
day against William Henderson charg
ing him with assault to commit murder.
He is now in jail awaiting disposition
of the murder charge. He confessed his
complicity in the killing of Policeman
MRS. BAIRD OBJECTS TO AN
ALLOWANCE FOR SON'S WIFE
Files Opposition Statement Reviewing
Young Man's Financial Troubles
and Present Needs.
Mrs. Veronica C. Baird, guardian of
her son, Miles T. Baird, yesterday filed
objections to the application of Mrs.
Ruth Jackson Baird, the young man's
wife, for an allowance of $200 a month
out of his estate. The mother declares
that $75 a month is enough for Mrs.
Baird Jr. and her child and that $102
Is already received monthly by her
daughter-in-law from property pur
chased by money given her by Miles
Baird. She denies that Miles Baird
paid his wife $200 a month out of his
income, but says It was borrowed
money.
The elder Mrs. Baird explains her
son's financial transactions, beginning
with his share in the estate of his
father. I She says his interest is now
pledged to her for advances of more
than $25,000 and the amount remain
ing for him and his wife is $15,592.
The Income from his stock is $306 a
month. The mother says that she re
quires $110 a month to pay for his
lodging and treatment and must em
ploy a nurse. She asks the court .to
reject the wife's claim and make such
a disposition of the Income as will per
mit her to pay his $3000 debts, provide
physicians to cure his incompetency
and save the remainder of his estate
for himself and family.
Eugene C. Robinson on the night of
January 21, H>o2. In running away
from the scene of the murder he
wounded Detective Taylor, and the as
sault to murder charge was placed
against him to hold him as a witness
against "Kid" Goucher, who is to be
brought back from the Minnesota peni
tentiary to stand trial for the murder
of Robinson. The three years will
elapse to-day, and, inasmuch as he
might be set free too soon in consider
ation of his turning State's evidence,
the Grand Jury was called on by th<i
District Attorney to anticipate the op
eration of the statute of limitations.

MINOR APPOINTMENTS TQ
BE MADE IN A FEW DAYS
Fire Commissioner Boyne Does Not
Relish Idea of Transfer In "Shift"
of City Officials.
The appointments to various subor
dinate positions under the city govern
ment will be made in a few days. Her
bert Schmitz will be again named as
secretary of the Park Commission, re
placing James de Succa, who will be
transferred either to the storekeeper
ship of the Board of Education or the
'secretaryship of the Board of Works.
It was said yesterday. that Fire Com
missioner Boyne had refused to con
sider the acceptance of the secretary
ship of the Police Commission to aid
in the proposed "shift" already out
lined by The Call, whereby Supervisor
Finn is to be made a Fire Commis
sioner so the Mayor may be enabled
to appoint a Supervisor who will de
fend h,is cause on the board. Who
that man will be has not been given out,
and in fact the matter has not been
settled. Boyne does not relish the idea
of taking a subordinate position, al
though the Reglstrarship hardly enters
into that category and pays double the
salary of a Fire Commissioner. Boyne
appears to be the stumbling block in
the plan. John G. Fitzgerald, Barney
Flood and George Berger have hopes
of being favored for one of the vacant
positions.

wNEWS OF THE COUNTY OF ALAMEDA *>
WOULD ABOLISH
"CO-OP." STORE
Famous Institution on Uni
versity Campus Objected
To by Local Stationers
WANT LEGISLATIVE ACT
College Men Plan Resistance
to Merchants' Campaign
Against Their Industry
Berkeley Office San Francisco Cali,
2148 Center Street. Jan. 20.
One of the unique and distinctive fea
tures of the university campusâthe
f: ri ns "Co-op." skoreâ is threatened
v extinction by merchants of Berke
i< ho object to Its competition with
theii irade. Information came to the
vi.i rsity authorities last night that a
bill lesigned to drive the "Co-op." off
the campus had been prepared and
would be introduced in the Leislature.
Action in opposition to this move of
th? Berkeley stationers was taken at
once by the university people. Man
ager R. Davis of the Co-operative store
began a correspondence with Assembly
man W. H. Waste, from this district,
setting forth the university's side of
the argument. Professor Carl C.
P'.ehn of the college of commerce, who
was in Sacramento last night, was ap
pealed to in the interests of the Co
operative store, and he is expected to
enlighten the legislators regarding the
enterprise.
A business amounting to nearly
$100,000 a year is done by the "Co-0p.,"
its patronage being confined exclusive
ly to students and professors of the
university. School supplies and station
â¢pry, with some art objects, are
dealt in.
. Aside, front its commercial features,
the "Co-0p.," as all students familiar
ly term the institution, has its social
â¢side, constituting one of the interest
ing features of campus, life. The store
is located in the basement of old
"North Hall," urid is a daily rendezvous
for students.
The proposal to drive the "Co-op."
.off the campus is understood to have
as its reason the plea that no such in
stitution should be allowed to do busi
ness, rent free, on the State's land in
competiton with private citizens in the
same line of business. Commenting on
the situation. Joseph P. Loeb, editor of
the Daily Californian, says in the col
lege paper to-day:
These men must be completely Ignorant of
the nature and purpose of the Students' Co
operative Association. It is a company con
*..-n'.>; entirely and exclusively of persons
"connected with the T'nlverslty of California,"
as is distinctly stated in its constitution; its
board of directors consists of faculty members
antKrepresentatlves of the four undergraduate
classes; its object Is to furnish to students
arid faculty books and other articles required
by the university. Since the association is
run by the students and for the students it has
a- undisputed a right to its store on the
campus as the Dining Association to
its building, the college publications to
their offices, or the Associated Students to
California Field. All of these concerns are
annually reaping consio'eTÃWte profits, but the
profits return to the students and no disin
terested terson has ever objected that they are
unfairlyjcompeting with slmil.ur institutions
off the tampus. The Students' Co-operative
Association is a paying business, but its
profits, too, are divided among members of the
university In the form of annual dividends.
The manager receives a salary. The Students'
Co-operative Association does not compete for
town trade. There is no under-selling, no
Illegitimate competition. To professors and
students the Students' Co-operative Association
Is a necessity. It is where it belongs and
there It ought to stay. It is a significant fact
that the movement against the association is
being stirred up by comparatively new corners
to Berkeley, unacquainted with facts and anx
ious chiefly to gain trade for themselves. The
oldest of the town stationers âthe firm of N.
J. Abbott & Sonsâ"have no complaint what
ever to make" and "can see no reason for the
present agitation against the Co-op." The
university noeds the student store on the
campus. That alone Is sufficient defense for
its undisturbed continuance.
None of the stationers of Berkeley
will admit having prepared the bill,
though F. W. Durgin, Needham Bros,
and F. E. Sadler declared that they
are opposed to the "Co-op." as a com
petitor.
Troubles of the Married.
OAKLAND, Jan. 20.âMargaret Klee
of Haywards obtained a divorce to
day from Henry W. Klee on the
ground of desertion. She asserted that
he had gone away with a woman by
the name of Ida Herbert, who was re
cently divorced from her husband.
Henry L. Falster had a narrow escape
from going to Jail this morning for
contempt of court for failure to pay
his wife $20 monthly alimony. Judge
Melvin said he would send him to Jail
if the attorney for Mrs. Falster in
sisted, but it was argued that the man
could earn no money at his trade of
hodcarrier while Imprisoned, so an
other week was given him.
For Shorter Working Hours'.
OAKLAND, Jan. 20.âThe Board of
Police and Fire Commissioners to-day
recommended that the working hours
of the police patrol wagon drivers be
reduced from twelve to eight. This
will mean the appointment of another
driver if the City Council acts favor
ibly upon the recommendation. The
card appointed Daniel Q. Murdock to
by a special policeman. Patrolman P.
McKeegan will be placed on trial to
morrow afternoon on a charge of un
lawfully arresting James Breen, a sa
loon man.
Dies Under Wrong Name.
OAKLAND, Jan. 20.âMoney to the
amount of $2572 76, now In the hands
of the Public Administrator to the
credit of the estate of Carl St. Aubyn,
was ordered distributed to Mrs.
Charles Cooper and her daughter, Eve
lyn May. It was shown that they were
the widow and daughter of St. Aubyn,
who, coming to America, changed his
name from Charles Cooper and became
an actor.
PETTY THIEF SENTENCED.âOakIand,

LONDON TALKS
TO COLLEGIANS
Novelist Urges Students to
Become Socialist Propa
gators for a "Bomance"
ADDRESS AT UNIVERSITY
Crowd Listens to Author's
Declaration That Great
devolution Is Impending
Berkeley Office San Francisco Call,
2148 Center street, Jam 20.
Anxious to have students of the uni
versity join him in propagating the
tenets of the Socialist party, Jack Lon
don, the novelist, to-day devoted forty
minutes to advocating socialist doc
trines.
Fifty grave and dignified professors
of the university Occupied seats back
of London, and President Wheeler sat
close to the socialist advocate as he
boldly declared that he stood with
15,000,000 people, socialists of America
and Europe, who "propose to destroy
society as it exists to-day." President
Wheeler listened respectfully, and when
the hands of the clock pointed to 12,
and London told his audience he
thought it would be better to stop
short there, President Wheeler encour
agingly said: "Oh, noâgo on."
Harmon , Gymnasium was filled to
overflowing. The speaker came clad in
negligee shirt, tennis belt and garb
otherwise unconventional. He told of
baring his body once while rooming
with a poor London workingman, in
the act of disrobing, the result being
an exclamation of envy and despair
from the poor workingman, who cried
out against the fate that had made
London's body strong and vigorous and
his own puny. He said:
"It is to change all thatâto give each
man an equal chance at food and other
essentials that the Socialist party
works and proposes a revolution, com
pared to which the French and Ameri
can revolutions were insignificant af
fairs."
London cited the part taken by Rus
sian students in reform movements and
urged his hearers to become part of
the same movement, which, he de
clared, should appeal to their love of
romance, as being a "clean, noble and
live movement."
President Wheeler, in a preliminary
talk, discussed briefly the Import of the
university's registration figures for the
term. He said the total enrollment was
2020, as against ,1933 a year ago. The
204 "cinches" he apportioned as fol
lows: Freshmen 70, culture colleges 98,
college of applied science 106. There
were forty-five woman "cinched." The
figures revealed, he said, that the tech
nical courses are stiffer than others.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 21, 1905.
SCHOOL PRINCIPAL IS KILLED
II MYSTERIOUS MANNER.
Death Ascribed to Accidental Shot
OAKLAND, Jan. 20.âHarry W.
Lynch, principal of the Centerville
Grammar School and an educator of
prominence in California, met death to
day under circumstances which cloud
the case in a shroud of mystery. With
the side of his head and face blown off
by a shotgun charge, the weapon lying
near him, Lynch's body was found at
9:30 o'clock this morning in a field two
miles from Centerville by two dairy
men, F. T. Dexoto and Joseph Nevis.
The corpse was lying near a fence
along the county road. The muzzle of
the weapon pointed at the mangled
head. The 'Stock \va*s at Lynch's feet
and inside the lower rail of the fence.
The general indications seemed to show
that the schoolmaster had accidentally
killed himself while dragging the load
ed gun though the fence, over which
he had climbed to wander after birds.
Lynch seemed to be in his usual good
spirits this morning when he left home
in his customary way to go to the
school. But after arriving there he
took a horse and buggy shortly before
9 o'clock and drove away. On his Jour
ney Lynch stopped at the residence of
Richard Blacow. He met Mrs. Blacow
and from her borrowed a shotgun and
two shells, only enough to load the
weapon. Lynch told his neighbor he
intended to go hunting. He was not
seen again alive.
Deputy Coroner Francis, who was
summoned to take charge of the body,
declared that his lnvestigaton satisfied
him that Lynch had been accidentally
killed. Francis found no letters nor
any other evidence that Lynch had in
tended to commit suicide, although the
circumstances under which he went
away appeared unusual.
At the school Lynch's absence gave
rise to alarm. It was not long after
he had departed that the news was sent
|to Miss Treadwell, the teacher tempo
rarily in charge, regarding the finding
of Lynch's remains. The dead princi
pal's wife was also notified, and she
was prostrated by the shock.
Lynch had long been an active work
er in Republican politics in Alameda
County. He was a candidate six years
ago for the Republican nomination for
County Superintendent of Schools, but
was beaten by S. W. Waterman of
Berkeley. T. O. Crawford defeated
Waterman at the election. At the last
county election Lynch won the nom
ination, but Crawford defeated him.
Lynch made a hard canvass and spent
considerable money. His defeat great
ly worried him, but his friends do not
think it could have preyed upon his
mind sufficiently to have induced a
thought of suicide.
In a recent business venture in the
musical line, Lynch did not fare well
financially, but even this does not give
sufficient cause in his friends' eyes for
an act of self-destruction.
In educational affairs Lynch had
been active. He was an authority on
school questions, particularly in the
matter of district school government.
At county and State institutes and
other educational assemblages he was
always a leader in the work. He was
45 years old and had conducted schools
at Centerville for many years. Besides
his, widow he leaves four young chil
dren. He was a brother of Dr. W. F.
B. Lynch of Elmburst. Lynch was
Identified with the Woodmen of the
World and was known in fraternal cir
cles throughout the State. Coroner
Mehrmann will hold an inquest.

Chinese Driven Out of San
Francisco Operate Joints
iv Peaceful Island City
ALAMEDA, Jan. 201âHordes of
Chinese lottery dealers and gamblers,
hunted from San Francisco, have taken
refuge here and the vicinage of Park
street and Railroad avenue, where the
local Chinatown is located, presents a
lively aspect. Squads of Chinese may
be observed parading Park street dur
ing the afternoon and at night the late
trains for San Francisco are crowded
with the Asiatic gamblers returning to
that city after having tried their luck
in the local "joints."
The invasion of the San Francisco
lottery promoters and gamblers has
aroused the Jealousy of the local Mon
golians, whom the police believe have
been conducting games of chance, and
the following communication received
by City Clerk James W. Glllogly to
day, written apparently in a Chinese
hand, is thought to be a crude effort
on the part of some local Chinese to
cail attention to the invasion of the
San Francisco gamblers:
"Alameda City Hall, Can Chinaman
gamblero open fine house for one hun
dred dollars money? No. 19."
The communication was written on
a postal card that bore every odor
characteristic of Chinatown.
One well knowp local Chinese, who is
opposed to the San Francisco lottery
men and gamblers coming to Alameda,
is authority for the statement that
four lottery companies from San Fran
cisco are operating here and have been
doing so for several days. The head
quarters of these companies are in the
stores of Quong Tin San, 2326 Railroad
avenue; Quong Ling Lung, 2324 Rail
road avenue, and Quong Sing Tong.
2322% Railroad avenue. Drawings are
said to take place each day at 3 o'clock
in the afternoon and at 10 o'clock at
night. One of these companies is re
puted to have a capital of $10,000, one
a capital of $5000 and the other, two a
capital of $1000 each.
This afternoon nearly 300 Chinese
came from San Francisco and the un
usual number of Asiatics on the local
trains caused many people to ask if
there wÂ«b a Mongolian festival being
held in Alameda. Hundreds of Chinese
gamblers also come here from Oakland
to play the lotteries, as the police of
that city recently raided the gambling
"joints" there. It is likely that the vis
iting Chinese lottery dealers and
gambler!" will be given a surprise by
the local police if the necessary evi
dence can be obtained.

Merchants' Exchange Com
mittee to Present an Ordi
nance to Remove All Poles
MEET CITY OFFICIALS
Give Three Years' Time to
Cut Out Obstructions and
Forbid Erection of More
Oakland Office San Francisco Call.
1016 Broadway, Jan. 20.
First steps were taken to-day in this
city looking toward the removal of all
telephone, telegraph, electric light, fire
alarm and police telegraph poles from
the business district. Upon suggestion
from Mayor Olney an ordinance will
be presented to the City Council by
the Merchants' Exchange directing the
removal of all poles within three years
and forbidding the erection of any more
poles in the prescribed territory. This
means that all wires must go into un
derground conduits.
The subject was broached before the
Board of Public Works this afternoon
by a committee from the Merchants'
Exchange composed of Theodore Gier.
Wilbur Walker and A. Schlueter.
Frank A. Leach Jr. took part in the
conference. The committee presented
resolutions favoring the removal of the
poles, which were adopted by the ex
change. Mayor Olney explained that
jurisdiction over the poles and wires
rested in the City Council.
City Attorney McElroy arranged a
meeting with the merchants' commit
tee for to-morrow, when a draft of the
proposed ordinance will be given at
tention. Conferences with officials of
the Western Union and the Postal Tel
egraph companies, the telephone com
pany and the electric light company
will be held to determine how much
time will be required to make the
changes required. The ordinance
touching the subject In Los Angeles
was read. It allowed only one year in
which to get the poles out of the busi
ness district. Mr. Walker thought three
years should be granted in Oakland.
Mayor Olney has issued a legal opin
ion which declares that all existing or
dinances that in any manner appear
to give permission to any person to
encroach upon the public streets or
sidewalks is void on its face. Abutting
property owners, the Mayor asserts,
have no claim upon the sidewarxs. and
have no right to use them for the dis
play of merchandise.
Police Judge George Samuels to-day
declared his full accord with Mayor
Olney's crusaÂ«e for clear sidewalks. He
suspended judgment in the case of F.
W. Baker, a livery man on Fifteenth
street, near the City Hall, who had
been arrested for allowing a heavily
loaded wagon to stand on the sidewalk,
but his Honor said though he had no
desire to punish Baker he should in
sist upon holding up the Mayor's hands
in the work.
MOB THREATENS
A NEGRO FIEND
Citizens of Reno Aroused
by Brutal and Murderous
Attack on Helpless Mdjher
Special Dispatch' to The Call.
RENO, Jan. 20.âMrs. J. E. Harper,
wife of a commercial man of thlÃ city,
lies in a hospital here with her skull
crushed and at the point of deatJi, as
the result of a brutal attack made upon
her by a black brute named Eli Reeves.
The fiend was captured yesterday
morning after a long chase and is con
fined in the County Jail. A mob ap
proached the jail and demanded his
life, but the prisoner and y two other
murderers awaiting trial for their
crimes were smuggled from the .prison
and sent to the penitentiary in Carson
City on a special train to protect them
from lynching.
While Mrs. Harper was lying in a
bed between her two little children at
6:40 o'clock this morning the murder
ous negro entered the room and struck
the woman on the head with an ax,
crushing her skull. He then grabbed
her and dragged her into another room,
where he laid her on the floor. The
children had been quiet up to this time,
but seeing their mother on the floor
with the blood streaming from the
wound In her head they began to cry
and Reeves threatened to kill them.
Evelyn, the oldest child, grabbed her
little brother and sister by the hands
and hurried from the house, calling
loudly for help. The negro then carried
the unconscious woman from the house
and was attempting to finish his ter
rible work, when Irving, a neighbor,
arrived on the scene and frightened
him away. . s
The children gave a good description
of the fellow and In a short time posses
were searching in all directions for
him. Officer'Cadle and a boy named
Hazlett at last captured him in some
willows along the Truckee River and
brought him to the County Jail. A
mob soon gathered and demanded that
he be turned over to them. Sheriff Fer
rill resisted and arrested Dr. H. H.
Hamlin, a well-known optician of this
city, for inciting the mob to violence.
Later it was given out that Reeves
was not the right person and the mob
dispersed to search for the guilty man.
Sheriff Ferrill and ten deputies took
this opportunity to hurry Reeves, mur
derer Linderman and Dan Regan, ac
cused of murdering his mother-in-law,
frc-m the jail to a special train which
conveyed them to Carson City. It is
rumored that while in jail in Reno
Reeves begged the officers not to give
him to the mob and confessed to the
brutal crime, but the rumor cannot be
confirmed.

NEW CHANGES
IN POLITICS
Withdraws From the
Fight for Mayor and Com
bines With G. E. Randolph
. â¦
MOTT ACTIVE IN FIELD
â¦ â
On the Eve of the Primaries
Deals Are Being Made That
Involve Many Candidates
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1016 Broadway, Jan. 20.
With the municipal primary election
ten days away the political situation is
beginning to take shape. The latest
developments show Frank K. Mott and
George E. Randolph* both active candi
dates for the Republican and Municipal
League nominations for Mayor. Ran
dolph's candidacy was announced to
day In connection with a combination
with Councilman Edwin Meese in the
Fourth Ward. The active candidacy of
Frank K. Mott was also announced at
the same time.
Mott and Meese have long been
friends personally, and politically for
some time, and until Mott became an
active candidate for Mayor Meese was
also thought to be a candidate for that
position. But Mr. Meese came out in
a signed statement issued to-day in
which he announced his absolute with
drawal from the fight for Mayor and
declared that his delegation in the
Fourth Ward would be for himself for I
Councilman at large, George E. Ran
dolph for Mayor and for C. H. Red
ington for School Director.
This separation of the Meese and
Mcrtt interests is the most interesting
development of the political game and
has created an entirely new situation in
Oakland politics. It also complicates
the situation in the Fourth Ward. Rob
ert Boyer is to put a ticket in the field
against the Meese ticket, Boyer desir
ing to be Councilman from the ward,
a position which he once held, and for
which Meese defeated him two years
ago with the aid of Mott.
The only other fight apparent upon
the Republican field of battle at pres
ent is in the Sixth Ward, where M. F.
Kelley is struggling to control the ward
delegation against Councilman W. J.
Baccus, Frank Barnett and Dan Doody.
The Kelley following has announced
Victor Chloupek as its candidate for
Councilman from the ward against
Baccus. The two factions that have
been fighting in this ward claim that
they are not fighting over the nomina
tion for Mayor.
Abe P. Leach, present Prosecuting
Attorney for the Oakland Police Court,
is an avowed candidate fos the Repub
lican and Municipal League nomina
tions for City Attorney. J. E. McElroy,
the present City Attorney, wants to be
returned with the Democratic and Mu
nicipal League nominations.
There are a number of possible and
a few avowed candidates for Mayor,
all of whom seem to be seeking the
Republican and Municipal League
nominations combined. George F.
Neese, a young decorator whose name
sometimes becomes confused with that
of the Councilman who has Just drawn
out or the fight, is a candidate for the
Republican nomination for that office.
He says he has the support of a num
ber of unions. D. C. Brown, a local
merchant, has a little organization be
hind him that claims a large following
in the Republican party. R. H. Cham
berlain, Stewart W. Booth, George W.
Reed and others are among the avail
able candidates. Randolph has been
frequently spoken of, but witnout ap
parent authority until to-night when
the combination with Meese In the
Fourth Ward made him an avowed
candidate.

ANNUAL SACE, TEN MILLION BOXESMANCHURIA ENCOUNTERS STORNS
BRINGS VALUABLE CARGO FROM ORIEMT
'â¢' The Pacific Mail Company's liner
Manchuria, Captain J. W. Saunders,
which reached port late Thursday night
from Yokohama direct, passed quaran
tine early yesterday morning and long
before noon her passengers had landed
and- the work of discharging cargo was
In full swing.
.' The Manchuria brought 488 passen
gers, of whom 421 were Asiatics. The
â¢liner's cargo was large, varied and of
great value. It included 707 cases of
opium, valued at $263,039; 1332 bales of
.raw silk, worth about $799,200; 47,660
rolls of matting, containing 1,906,400
yards, or enough to stretch from New
York to more than 100 miles beyond
Chicago. There were shipments of tea,
peanuts, gunnies, rice, oil and gambler.
There was also treasure, valued at
â¢33,000. ,
The Manchuria was in heavy weather
from the time she left Yokohama until
she reached this port. Time and again
the forward end of the giant liner was
hidden beneath green seas and no part
â¢of her lofty superstructure was high
enough to escape the salty spray which
enveloped her almost constantly. The
Chinese boatswain narrowly escaped
being washed overboard. He was
.caught by a sea and swept about the
deck like an animated cork. Twice he
grabbed a winch and twice his hold
was broken by the force of the flood.
When the waters subsided the Oriental
sailor man was picked up, alive, but so
badly battered that he has been out
.of .commission ever since.
â¢In spite of the weather, however,
Captain Saunders brought his big ship
Lrrlo port looking Just as clean and
"yachtlike as he always kept his smaller
charge, the Newport. The Manchuria,
in spite of heavy weather, reached port
nearly two days before she was ex
pected, as neither she nor her sister,
;he Mongolia, were built for speed. She
was 13 days, 9 hours and 27 minutes
corning from Yokohama.
Pay Inspector M. C. McDonald of the
navy, who has been stationed in the
Orient for the last eight years, returned
oh the liner. He is on his way to
Washington. Y. Hirose and H. Ko
mada, passengers on the liner, are Jap
anese merchants on their way to New
York, and Rev. G. E. Ryerson is an
Episcopal missionary, who has been in
'Japan for about fouf years.
. Mr. and Mrs. George W. Wilder,
â¢wealthy Londoners, who are making a
leisurely circuit of the globe, were pas
sengers on the Manchuria. The cus
toms inspector who searched the Wil
ders' baggage received a Cocos-island
thrill when he opened Mrs. Wilder's
Jewel case. It was a burglar's dream.
Not even in shop window had he ever
seen such wealth of rare stone and
precious metal, and all the Jewels ever
lost hy careless soubrettes seemed but
trifling toys in comparison.
Collector of the Port Stratton, who
was on the dock, took charge of the
jewel problem and solved it by allow
ing Mrs. Wilder to keep her rings and
like possessions. At first sight the col
lection of Jewels looked like a whole
sale Jeweler's full stock, but the Wild
ers satisfied the Collector that they
were people of great wealth; that If
their fancy called for a Cleopatra cock
tail before each meal, they had the
means to provide the ingredients, and
that these Jewels, which to some might
seem expensive luxuries, were to the
Wfiders merely the incidental trim
mings of a traveling wardrobe. The
pretty things were not for sale and
would leave America with the Wilders.

NEW CHARGES
Second Presentment to Be
Brought Against Talbot
on Irvine Accusations;
NEW YORK, Jan. 20.âA second pre
sentment to be brought against the
Right Rev. Ethelbert Talbot, Bishop
of the diocese of Central Pennsylvania,
upon charges made by Dr. Ingram N.
W. Irvine, which is now being prepared
as the result of a conference held in this
city, contains. It is understood, in the
main only two charges. The first is
said to be "immorality," meaning
"lying," and the second "violations of
ordination vows."
The first charge is based principally
on the Upjohn letter and contains nine
teen counts, but more may be added
before the paper is finally sent to Pre
siding Bishop Tuttle of St. Louis. The
charges of "violation of ordination ,
vows" rest solely on the unfrocking of
Dr. Irvine. They draw the Episcopal
divorce canon, which was recently en
acted, into the controversy. Tha
charges against Bishop Talbot in con
nection with Mr*. Elliott of Hunting
don are reiterated and several new
side features have been added. There
may be, it is said, a third charge, but
the presenters have not yet decided on
this.
Much difficulty was experienced ht
obtaining two presbyters from Bishop
Talbot's diocese to attach their
names to the paper, but according to
the canon it is necessary to have the
signatures of rectors or priests at pres
ent engaged in that district. Any priest
at present employed in missionary
work who is connected with the diocese
of the accused may be eligible.

ADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO
JOHN Mc N AUGHT ... â¢ â¢ Blanager
pcblication ~ office ~ third and market streets, san francisco
Saturday" January 21, 1905
BEFORE the bill for the proposed child labor law came to hand
we suggested certain limitations that should be observed in
such a statute. The State has no right to pauperize a family
by depriving its minor members of the right of self-support, or of
contributing to the support of other members who are temporarily
or permanently incapacitated. The bill which has since come to
.hand seems to respect these limitations, and also seems to consider
enforced idleness as equal in injury to enforced work or improper
hours. It exempts horticultural and agricultural labor of the mem
bers of a family, and on the whole appears to be a wholesome and
proper measure.
This problem has been found always a difficult question to
deal with, but one principle is plain and should never be departed
from. kinds of labor, such as underground, or among
machinery, or where there are conditions necessarily inimical to
the health of the young, should be prohibited to children entirely,
no matter how short the hours. In certain lines of manufacture
where the air is filled with particles the foundation of weak lungs
and consumption is laid. Every precaution should be taken in
regulating every occupation in which children become wage-earners
to give them pure air, access to sunshine, pure water and clean and
sanitary surroundings. Fully developed and robust adult constitu
tions have a resistant power against conditions that are grossly
improper for children. For these reasons every preference should
be given to free outdoor work in the country for'children.
California has quite excellent conditions now respecting the
labor of women and children, and legislation on the subject is,
happily, less correctional than precautionary. The census shows
â¢in the continental United States 22,489,425 breadwinners, of whom
2,855,425 are classed as young persons. The percentage of adults
is 67, of men 77, and of young persons 9. In California the per
centage of adults is 77, of men 85, and of young persons only 7.
The report of the Commissioner of Labor shows in 153 estab
lishments in San Francisco and vicinity with 6519 employes only
284 minors between 14 and 16 years of age, only 105 between 12
and 14 and only 7 under 12 years. These minors are principally
employed in dry goods and department stores, where it may be
assumed that sanitary conditions are fairly good. Every law on
the subject should decrease restrictions about the middle teens. A
boy of 16, if strong and healthy, should make a beginning of his
industrial career. He should do it under proper legal protection,
but within that should have as much liberty of action as is
possible, for he must begin learning independence and self-reliance.
To surround him with the restrictions of early childhood until only
â¢ attainment of his majority removes them is a dangerous thing,
for he becomes a man with no experimental knowledge of the re
sponsibilities of manhood.
The most advanced child labor laws, like those of Massachu
setts, ease up the restrictions at 16 years of age. The bill now
before the California Legislature extends them to 18 years only
in regard to the hours of labor. It was prepared and introduced by
the S&cial Settlement Association and is indorsed by the Merchants'
Association, which should secure its passage. In a very important
sense it is an educational measure, following closely the Massa
chusetts law in that respect. It provides that no minor under 16
years of age shall be employed during school 'hours unless able
to read English at sight and write legibly and correctly English
sentences. This makes ignorance a disqualification for employ
ment and will powerfully discourage voluntary illiteracy. Some
parents are so unnatural that they are willing to keep their chil
dren in ignorance and deny them schooling, to enjoy the proceeds
of their labor, when amply able to support themselves. When such
find their children under protection of the law, which makes
illiteracy a bar to employment, they will see to it that their chil
dren have schooling. The spirit of the law is that the eleven years
passed by children between the school age of five years and the
age of sixteen shall be used in acquiring a sound common school
education. If those years are well used, a child is put in possession
of the key to higher knowledge if it be needed, and otherwise is
equipped with that which is required in making a success of
life, if it be supplemented with thrift, industry, temperance, health
and good habits.
The administration of the law is to be the duty of the State
Labor Commissioner. This is proper and it will result in the
Legislature making proper provision for that office, which has been
permitted to become practically a cipher, as it consists of an official
title and but little else. It is believed that the incumbent is especially
well equipped to make it a useful State activity, of great benefit to
the people and justifying better attention than has heretofore been
given to its needs.
THE SUNDAY CALL MAGAZINE.
NOTHING could better demonstrate to the public the wide
spread interest aroused by the fiction contest instituted by
The Sunday Call some months ago than a recital of the figures
showing the number of manuscripts received. Some time ago the
statement was made that nearly every State in the Union had been
represented, and every county in California many times over, and
instances were cited. No figures were given, however, as to the
number of manuscripts received. During the first week of the con
test but fourteen manuscripts came in; during the past week ihere
were 147. This is a condition entirely novel in the career of any
daily paper, for the original fiction field has always been claimed
exclusively by the magazines and the leading .weeklies.
The winning story for this week is by Charles Tenney Jackson,
entitled 'The Fever at Bully Creek." It is a virile story of Western
life, with a quaint tinge of humor, and is in full accord with the
gtyle of stories soughtâstories of Western life and Western char
acter. Mr. Jackson is the author of 'The Masque of Joy," which
was published aa a Christmas story in the Christmas edition cf The
Sunday Call, and it a young writer living in* San Francisco whose
work has attracted the attention of one of the leading publishing
houses in the East.
Other features of worth to-morrow will be the fourth install
ment of H. Rider Haggard's latest ""The Brethren," a
romance of the Crusades; "Jottings of Old Lim Jucklin: On Truth/"
.by Opie Read, in which the country store philosopher delivers him
self of some original ideas regarding truth and the telling of the
truth; "The Love of the Maid," one of Norman Duncan's strong
stories of the Atlantic coast, in which is portrayed simply and
vividly the predominant elemental passions and desires of his toiling,
narrow lived, rugger fisher folk; "On and Off the Bread Wagon,"
being the continuation of the adventures of Charles Dryden's itine
rant iron raolder; "Chimmie Fadden," in which Edward W. Town
send delivers himself of another installment of Bowery idioms and
oddities of speech, and in addition to a a page of storiettes, the puzzle
page for the children, which affords the last opportunity at special
holiday prize books which have been offered since Christmas.

THE CHILD LABOR BILL.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, JANUARY 21, 1905.
We are Informed that Mrs. Firefly Jones, since the recent loss of her husband,
is keeping as much put of the public eye as possible.
âFrom the European edition of the New York Herald.
*< A MOOD >â¢>,
. . "J y ND no man can foretell what
/ \ the future has in store for
y y him/ *
Nature herself, to Judge
from appearances, had the dumps. A
despairing sky looked gloomily down
on a despondent earth through an at
mosphere as damp and chilling as a
wet blanket. With a little shiver of
discomfort at the aspect of things,
Katherine laid the book face downward
on her lap in the way that one should
not, and, picking up the poker, gave
the Are a thrust or so, as a rider spurs
his horse to greater effort.
"Ugh! What a day!" her thoughts
ran. "One would think Joy were dead.
Fire won't burn, sun won't shine, even
the sparrows huddle together lumplsh
ly without energy enough to scrap."
She picked up the book again and re
read the last sentence. "And no man
can foretell what the future has in
store for him." This time she closed
the book and placed it on the table be
side her. Decidedly, she was in no
mood f6r reading, and", with Jpands
clasped idly in her lap, she sat staring
into the fire. But that last sentence
dogged her thoughts. The past, with
its smiles and tears, was left behind.
The rtresent seemed momentarily a
thing to be endured as one might; but
the future!
At this point her eyes turned from
the grate and fixed themselves upon
the ring that she wore upon the third
finger of her left hand. It was a beau
tiful ringâa pink pearl that reminded
one of tender dawns, flanked by two
diamondsâher engagement ring. Or
dinarily she could not look at it with
out a kindling of the heart, a thrill of
warmth and happiness. To-day, she
eyed it with languid, restless interest.
That, then, represented her future. It
was as fixed and irrevocable as the past
itself. How well she knew what It
would be like. Had she not seen dozens
of her friends marry, bubble blissfully
for a brief year or so and then subside
into the stale beer of domestic exist
ence? If she had ever thought that
with Jack and her it would be differ
ent, the illusion had vanished in the
bleak light of this all-revealing day,
which brought out every sordid detail
of existence with bitter emphasis.
Different? Of course they would
not be different. There would be the
brief, dazzling happiness of the honey
moon, the glamour of new possessions
and then some day they would both
suddenly tire of the play and see each
other for the first time plainly. Jack
would squint his eyes critically and
discover that she was not the most
beautiful woman in the world after all
âthough, of course, he would be too
well bred to say anything. He would
simply be a trifle bored at the let
down and plunge into business to for
get, kissing her absently In the morn
ing and evening as a mere formâa
matter of habit *
And she? Well, she would rub her
eyes about the same time and see, to
her amazement, that he was just a
plain, ordinary, average man without
a single god-like attribute and with
a painful and unmistakable tendency
to grow bald and stout. But she,-too,
would be politely reticent and hold up
her face for that perfunctory kiss and
try to forget it all In a feverish en
thusiasm over house and gowns. And
they would grow more and more
silent toward each other, conversing
mostly in monosyllables. Never would
they quarrelâher lips closed a trifle
more firmly at the mere thoughtâ
âbut each would withdraw further
and further into his own little world,
and they would communicate with
each other through small wickets, aa
the ticket sellers at the theaters do
with the public.
The details of this gloomy picture
were as clearly visible to her mind as
though she saw them with her eyeÃ,
and she laughed ruefully. Was this
sort of thing necessary? How did
she know that Jack was The Man?

NO WONDER.
Might not the real person still be
imbedded in the future like a fly in
amber?
At the thought she caught her
breath and. leaning forward, dropped
her face upon her hands and gazed
into the Are with a new intensity. It
was a tremendous thought, but what
guarantee had she that he was her
ideal? He seemed so, perhaps, merely
because he approached it more nearly
"John 081, quick, Central!"
than any man Bhe had yet metâbut
no one could tell what the future had
In store for him. There waa the rub.
She proceeded to develop the
thought with application* unmistak
ably feminine. Like an Index finger
her mind pointed backward to the day
when big sleeves had seemed the most
entrancingly becoming things a wom
an could wear. Then inexorably, it
pointed again, this time to the sleeves
she was then wearing, tight above the
elbow, but with great pouches sag
ging below. And these were now
chic and the others Impossible. The
poor old fashions of yesteryearâhow
ugly and deforming they appeared!
Could It be that by any possibility the
likingsâthe loves of to-day would â
With a rush It came over her that
one's loves did change. There was
Prissy Clemens, whom she had wor
shiped when she wore her hair in pig
tailsâand now' could not endure. There
was Aunt Grace, whom, as a child, she
had considered cold and severe, and
Aunt Ruth, whom she had loved. Now
their, places In her esteeem were ex
actly reversed. Aunt Ruth was kind,
but uninteresting, while Aunt Grace
was inspiring.
"It is possible," she murmured tense
ly to the Are. "Somewhere in the fu
ture there may be a man who Is all
that Jack Is and more. And what If I
should meet him I"
Her lips parted. Half unconsciously
â he drew off the ring. Its pressure had
suddenly become unbearable. How
could she wear It without knowingâ
without feeling sure in her own heart
that it meant finality in the matter of
choice, meant that with all the world
to choose from she would have him and
no other?
And how could she-know that? She
might send back the ring and wait. But
meanwhile, what of Jack? It seemed
scarcely probable that he would ac
quiesce mildly in such a proceeding.
She laughed hysterically. She could

MOURNING âB. C, City. The
wearing of a brasseur on the sleeve as
an emblem of mourning is regulated
by the desire of the wearer and by the
degree of relation that existed between
the wearer and the one who passed
away and for whom the individual
goes into mourning. The usual time
is one year for parents or brothers or
sisters; for grandparents, six months;
for uncle or aunt, three months, and
for cousin one month. For husband
or wife one or two years. Of late
years the time of wearing mourning
has been shortened by many who do
not care to be guided by etiquette in
this matter, on the ground that no one
has a tight to throw a pall of gloom
over all with whom the mourner
BY
GORDON
Imagine htm, under sufficient provoca
tion, informing her that there were
Just as good fish to be found in the
sea as had ever been caught; aye, and
finding them, too! She winced as If
something she regarded as wholly hers
were slipping away from her.
Moreover, suppose she should break
her engagement because of the uncer
tainty as to whether he was her final
choice, and the future should bring no
other. What then?
She frowned in bewilderment. For
the first time, she realized with a gasp,
just how big a lottery marriage really
is. She had heard that trite phrase
many times, but it had never seemed
significant before. Now she felt as if it
were a lottery in which to a million
tickets there was trot one prize, and
she owned the tenth of a ticket.
With a sudden swish the rain washed
smoothly down over the outside of the
window pane as if the surcharged sky
could no longer' control itself. Kath
erine turned her head Impatiently. She
had no sympathy for any perplexities
save her own.
Again she held the little bejeweled
ring up before her with the tips of two
fingers and gazed at it solemnly, but it
seemed to have lost all meaning. It
was no longer a ring ordered by Jack
and designed especially for her. It
had the "any man to any woman"
look that always got upon her nerves.
She stared at it long and fixedly and
then Jumped to her feet and dashed
across the room Impulsively, sitting
down at the writing desk between the
windows.
With nervous haste she pulled some
paper from a pigeonhole, took up
the pen and dipped it deep in the ink
as one always does in moments of in
tense feeling. Then she pushed the
pen back and forth across the paper
in those long, scratching strides that
characterize the writing of the mod
ern woman and the sound was aa a
balm to her nerves.
"You'll laugh and call it nonsense?"
she wrote, "but Jack, I'm not sure!
And, of course, I must be sure,
mustn't I? Sure beyond any doubt,
beyond any possible man that may
come toward me out of the future.
And so I'm sending back the ring "
She was interrupted by a commo
tion in the street, where two rival
foghorns seemed at first to be vying
with each other. A moment later her
dazed ears disentangled the sounds
and she made out from the fearful din
the one word "Uxtra! Uxtra!" She
pushed up the "window and leaned out.
"Dreadful smash-up on th'll!" roar
ed the bigger of the paper boys, hold
ing up a black-lettered sheet inviting
ly, and Katherine nodded her head in
vigorous assent and flew down to the
door, her heart beats keeping time
with her footsteps. Accident on the
"L," and Jack always went up and
down that way! It must have hap
pened, too, at Just about the hour he
would have been going downtown, to
be in print now.
She fairly snatched the paper from
the boy's hands, not even waiting to
close the door as her eyes clutched at
the print ravenously. A moment later
she was at the telephone.
"John 031, quick. Central!" And a
second later the thin, Btrident voice of
the office boy was in her ears. "Is
Mr. Langley there?" And the answer
came, "Naw, hasn't been down to
day." She leaned limply against the
telephone and there a moment later
the maid found her.
"Mr. Langley, Miss."
"Yea, what of him?" She turned
toward the maid with staring expec
tant eyes and the latter looked back at
her In amazement. /
"He's in the drawing-room. He
i wants to see you," she stammered out.
He was alive then! For one mo
ment she stood still trying to realize
the beautiful truth of it. Then with a
queer choked laugh she ran lightly up
the stairs and snatching up the dis
carded ring kissed it rapturously and
| put it on her finger.

CATALPAâSubscriber, Alameda, Cal.
The catalpa is genus of trees of the or
der Big Nonlaceae. There are three
species. The chief, Catalpa springifolia,
is indigenous in the Southern States,
where it often grows to more than fifty
feet in height,, with a trunk two feet in
diameter. It has a silver gray bark,
few branches, a wide-spreading head
and large heart-shaped, pale green
leaves. The flowers are white, dotted
with purple and violet. The pods re
main on the tree through the winter.
The catalpa is much cultivated in the
Northern States and in Europe. In the
New England States it dwindles down
to a shrub and is often killed by frost.
In milder climates it will* grow to a
height of twenty feet in ten years and

BUILDING IS APPROVED
Four Wings to Represent Missions at Portland Show
Governor Pardee has approved of
drawings for the California building at
the Lewis and Clark Exposition
grounds at Portland, to represent, with
â Its contents, this State. The law makes
Governor Pardee a commissioner for
â¢ the Portland show, ex-officio. The
'. California structure that was erected
at the St. Louis Exposition was sug
gested by Governor Pardee, and it em
bodied the mission architecture. His
approval was needed to adopt any
.building.
Once more Governor Pardee has in
sisted that the California missions
shall be recalled in a State building for
exposition purposes. At St. Louis the
Santa Barbara Mission was particu
larly brought to mind. At Portland
suggestions of four missions will be in
corporated in the State's representative
structure.
The law passed by the last session
appropriated $20,000 for the preliminary
v.Â« i k for the Portland show. It was
foreseen that some work would have to
l c i" rformed in advance of the meeting
of the Legislature this year. Money
\> as. provided and placed at the dis
! -al of Governor Pardee as commis
sioner. A part of this has been ex
panded for plans from Dickey & Reed,
architects. These have found favor
with Governor Pardee.
The size of the structure to be erect
ed at Portland will depend upon the
amount of money the Legislature ap
propriates. The style of building is
fixed. Therefore it can be Judged by
the people at this time. The drawings
are on the scale of 200 feet. The four
wings that have been referred to will
be of varying sizes to reproduce, as
' nearly as possible, the respective pro
portions of the Carmel, Dolores, San
Luis Key and Santa Barbara missions.
The general shape of the State build
ing will be that of a cross. The State's
exhibits and the executive offices of
those who have charge of the exhibits
will, be in one building, which will
stand on the highest point in the Port
land Exposition grounds, so says Com
missioner Filcher, who has been doing
thf> preliminary work under the dlrec
â¢ tion of Governor Pardee. There will
be no lack of exhibits to fill all the
space that is allotted.

Food-Drink That Does That.
In the nine years Postum Pood
Coffee has been on the market it has
made many thousands of stanch
friends, but apparently none better
than the Clerk of Courts at Toledo,
â¢finish Honduras, who has sent a list
.of names of people in Central and
-South America, who now use Postum
in place of coffee, explaining In detail
their cases. He says:
''Have much pleasure in writing
you this letter for the good Postum
'has done myself and friends in this
district. The attached list of persons
to whom I have recommended Postum
will, I venture to say, give you great
Satisfaction. I have given the names
and addresses so any one can verify
my statement by writing to them."
(Pull particulars with names and ad
dresses will be sent by-mail to any
one.) "On the list the persons marked
â from 1 to 11 were confirmed tea
drinkers and when I spoke to them
about drinking Postum they laughed
at the idea of giving up tea. But I
â¢insisted on their giving Postum a trial
i>fore condemning it and went so far
! s to give some of them a package.
: hey all use Postum now and nothing
else.
"From No. 11 to 19 were coffee
â¢ fiends, my wife included, and they all
also thought it absurd to try to re
' I lace coffee by any other drink, but
after some persuasion I got them to
ry it and now they all Use Postum.
"No. 14, 16 and 16 suffered from
neryous prostration and sleeplessness
when they drank coffee. No. 10, Mr.
Lucas, had been ordered by doctors
hot to use tea or coffee "and had been
experimenting to find something to
drink. Postum has filled the bill and
now he not only orders It for himself
but for sale. Some of these people
did not like Postum at first because
they did not know how to make it,
but I invited them to my house and
gave them Postum, making it accord
ing to directions on the package, and
they all found it delicious.
"Now I will tell you how I came in
contact with Postum. Mr. Welle, liv
ing in' Toledo District mentioned Pos
tum and gave me a package for trial,
he waa so sure it would help me, as
I suffered from coffee drinking. Prom
that time I became a convert and

Frenzied Financier of Cum

Ridicules Postal Officials
Because of a certain comical frenzy
in his financial methods, Orlando K.
Fitzsimmons was haled before United
States Commissioner Heacock yester
day to show cause why he should not
be removed to Los Angeles for trial on
an indictment presented by the United
States Grand Jury of that city. Or
lando is accused of using the mails un
lawfully to advertise a lottery scheme
known as the Cumulative Credit Com
panyâa get-rich-quick concern on the
installment diamond (cinch) plan.
Some time ago the Postmaster Gen
eral issued a fraud order against the
concern and held its mail in the post
office. Thereupon, according to the in
dictment, Fitzsimmons mailed to his
correspondents printed circulars ridi
culing the postal officials. In one of
these he says:
The poÃtoi'flce highbinders have seen fit to
Issue a fraud order against me, Orlando K.
Fitzsimmons, personally, and also T. L. Lewis
and J. C. Hunter, and you will therefore
please address your letters to yourselves or to
some one of the following- addresses: I. O. O.

There were also several' stanzas of
rhyme, the first and last of which are
as follow:
Too Fast.
When old Ben Franklin tapped the clouds and
let the lightning loose.
To trickle down his kite string till It filled
hig Jar with Juice,
The old wiseacres shook their heads with ap
prehensive awe.
And said that doings such as these should
be suppressed by law;
Nc man had fooled with lightning In the great
and sacred past.
And so all men said. "Keerful, Ben.
Don't
Oo
Too
Fast."
And thus are Cumulative Credits Benefits as
sailed;
FltEsimmons and associates should every one
be Jailed.
For moving money rapidly, en rapport with
the times, \
Making dollars now appear where before were
only dimes.
The croaking Ignoramuses, they think It can
not last,
And parrot-like repeat the wall,
"They

In order to prevent the mlrthsome
Orlando from going too fast Judge
Heacock put him under $2000 bonds to
insure his appearance on the removal
proceedings.

Reports of Subordinate unions were
heard at the session yesterday of the
Bricklayers' and Masons' International
Convention. They showed that the
membership has gained 12,000 during
the last year. The unions have ex

was also shown that the subordinate
unions held about 5200,000 in their
treasuries.
An application was made by Dele

union to have the convention decide
on New York for the next convention.
Several minor differences in regard
to hours and working rules were
amicably settled. The election of of
ficers is expected to take place to-day.
It ia believed that several of the lead

CORBIN MAKES
STRONG DENIAL
Secretary of Loan Asso
ciation Says He Never Mis
appropriated Any Money
The officers and directors of the Con
tinental Building and Loan Association
scoff at the very suggestion of any
crooked work on the part of its secre
tary and general manager, William
Corbin. All are greatly angered by the
story that Corbin used nearly $250,000
of the concern's funds to further his
own Interests. The directors will make
an investigation to-day and issue a
statement to all the stockholders.
Corbin hints at a conspiracy on the
part of certain persons who, he claims,
are working to undermine him. He
posted a bulletin in the office of the
association on California street yester
day denying all the charges and in
forming the public that he had invited
the directors to investigate his ac
counts to-day and then make known
their findings to all the Interested par
ties.
"I regard the attack as a personal
affront,'' said Corbin, "and I want the
directors and everybody interested in
the matter to see for themselves. I do
not care about going into the details
of the case for the present, at least,
for then 1 would be simply giving my
word against that of my accusers, and
it would be of no benefit for the rea
son that many people are skeptical and
want to see for themselves.
"Politics and underhand work lie at
the bottom of the whole scheme. I have
incurred the enmity of certain persons
and now they are seeking revenge. The
directors have kept tab on the books
of the association right along, and if
there was anything wrong with my ac
counts they would not tolerate me any
longer. That stands to reason."
Gavin McNab, attorney for the Con
tinental Building and Loan Association,
corroborates the statement made by
Corbin. McNab was not connected
with the institution when the first
shortages are alleged to have been dis
covered, but since that time, he says,
there has been nothing wrong with
Corbin's accounts. McNab refused to
give out any official figures, declaring
there was nothing to say till the board
of directors should have finished its in
vestigation.

COUKT NOT CONVINCED
In Spite of Husband's Al
leged Debts Woman Is Held
to Be a Preferred Creditor
If Theodore Shelton Higgins, dentist,
does not by February 1 pay $250 on ac
count of the alimony due his wife Judge
Hebbard, who yesterday adjudged him
guilty of contempt of court, will sign
an order committing him to Jail. Mrs.
Higgins got a divorce a few days ago
on the ground of her husband's infi
delity, and yesterday she haled him
into court to explain why he had not
paid the alimony ordered at the time
of the filing of Tier suit. He had paid
only $179, and arrearages, with $250
for attorneys' fees, amounted to $521.
Higgins paid her $50 in court and
brought his records to show why he
oould not pay more.
His income, he said, had been from
$250 to $100 a month, and was nearly all
needed for expenses. Then he showed a
list of his debts. "But, this is a debt,
too," remarked the court, "and a pre
ferred one, J should say. I think you
can do better, and I will therefore find
you guilty of contempt of court and re
mand you to the custody of the Sheriff
on a commitment to be signed on Feb
ruary 1 if by that time you cannot
show a receipt from your wife for
$260." %
Judge Kerrigan ordered William Ba
come to pay his wife $26 a month
pending the hearing of his divorce case.
He was 63 years old and said to be
worth $20,000 when he married last
August, but he insists that his fortune
is not more than $6000 and his Income
about $100 a month.
The application of William A. Mat
thews for a modification of his wife's
divorce decree in order to give him the
custody of their two children was de
nied by Judge Troutt yesterday, but
Matthews will be permitted to see the
children three times a week.
A divorce was granted yesterday by
Judge Troutt to William Baddeley from
Laura Baddeley for desertion; by
Judge Kerrigan to Ellen E. Glaze from
Robert E. Glaze, sentenced In 1901 to
life imprisonment for murder; to An

Suit for separation was begun by

Old and without means, Mrs. La

selves in her behalf and are trying to

PROPOSED ACT
TO BE OPPOSED
City Officials Take Steps

TO GO TO LEGISLATURE
Board of Education Recom
mends That Pupils Visit
Business Establishments
President Roncovlerl of the Board of
Education, Superintendent of Schools
Langdon and Supervisor d'Ancona of
the Finance Committee held a confer
ence yesterday for the purpose of ar
ranging a definite opposition to the
proposed legislative act to change the
manner of the apportionment of State
school funds, which will result in a loss
of $260,000 on the income now derived i
for the support of the local schools. j
Roncovieri has prepared a statement"!
in which arguments are advanced to
show that the amendment would work '
a hardship on the schools and teachers
of San Francisco. It was decided that
Roncovieri and Superintendent Lang
don will personally oppose the measure
before the Legislature.
The Board of Education yesterday Is
sued a circular, in which it is recom
mended that principals of grammar
and high schools arrange to allow their
upper classes or parts of upper classes
to visit manufacturing and business es
tablishments. The circular says that
this may be made an important ad
junct of the school work, and
the co-operation of principals is re
quested. Principals are asked to sub
rait lists of places.
Friday, February 10, 1905, being the
nearest school day immediately preced
ing Sunday, February 12, the ninety
sixth anniversary of the birth of Abra
ham Lincoln, principals are directed to
request teachers to set aside the last
school hour of that day in order that
literary and musical exercises may be
held in commemoration of the life of
this great American.
The new rule 3 will be ready for dis
tribution at some time during Febru- |

SIGOURNEY AND WRIGHT SHOW SKILL
AT BILLIARDS IN PRACTICE,
Much Is Expected of the Californian Experts
Wilson P. Sigourney and H. A.
"Chick" Wright, California's repre
sentatives at the national amateur
billiard tournament soon to be held
in Chicago, are regarded as likely
candidates for the coveted first place
in the contest. From past records
each man looks like a possible victor,
even to the wise sports of the East.
Both men did practically all their
playing in the past here. Wright
commenced when but a lud in Stock
ton and from the time he made his
start he was well thought of. He
jumped into prominence last year
when he defeated Sigourney for the
title of amateur class A champion of
the Pacific Coast in a spirited tourna
ment at Morley's parlors.
Wright did some wonderful work in
that contest. William Spinks then
pronounced him the best amateur he
had ever seen. He had an average of
15 during the entire tournament and
made a high run of 111. It was
thought at the time he might possibly
break the amateur record of 169 for
the high run, but he failed, though in
practice he rolled up 219.
Sigourney has long been regarded
as one of the greatest amateur billiard
players in the country. For more than
t>ix years he has played in the various
tournaments In different cities of the
. coast. He won the amateur coast
championship title for class A players
three years ago and successfully de
fended it against all comers until
" Wright captured it last fall.
' Sigourney has done nearly all his
playing in this city. His defeat at the
hands of Wright came as a big sur
prise, but it was no disgrace, as he
â¢ made a splendid showing and the title
' was either man's till Wright finally
won out. Already several bets have
been registered on the chances of
"Wright and Sigourney in the tourna
ment and the former rules a slight
favorite on account of his victory in
the tournament last year.
The twenty-two men In the amateur
championship tournament are there
by invitation, the intention being to
â¢ secure the best players in all Ameri
ca. Wilson P. Foss, the Haverstraw
millionaire, who is pronounced the
greatest amateur balk line player in
America, will be among the competi
tors.

REUNION DINNER
Event to Be Held in This
City Next Month and to
Be Made Annual Feature
S. G. Buckbee, treasurer of the Auto
mobile Club of California, has returned
to this city after a visit to the Eastern
States. L. P. Lowe, chairman of the
executive committee of the club, has
been spending the past week at the au
tomobile exhibition in Madison Square,
New York, which opened last Saturday
and will close to-night. It is expected
he will return to this city with many
new and valuable Ideas.
Next month the Automobile Club will
hold a dinner, which it is intended to
ma*ke an annually recurring event. It
is believed to be a good thing to bring
the members together once a year so
they may get to know each other and
may feel that they are parts of the
same organization.
CALL A HALT OX STREET
SWEEPING EXPENDITURES
Supervisors Apply One-Twelfth Act
So Money May Be Available in
April, May and .Tune.
The Supervisors* Street Committee
yesterday decided to call a halt on the
expenditures now being made for the
sweeping of streets and recommended
the adoption of a resolution directing
the Board of Public Works to comply
with the provisions of the one-twelfth
clause of the charter. The sum of
$215,000 was appropriated for the
work during the fiscal year 1904-1905
and there is now a deficit of $6000 in
the fund. It has never been the cus
tom to apply the one-twelfth act to
the sweeping of streets, but the com
mittee is desirous of making up the
deficit and so expending the money
that there will remain the sum of
$56,250 for the work during April,
May and June, or three-twelfths of
the entire appropriation. The Board
of Works was criticized for sweeping
muddy streets during this period of
the year, the committee believing that
the money should be safeguarded so
that there will be sufficient to do the
work when the streets are dusty in
the three months named. Inspector
Cowden renewed his recommendation
that six sweeping machines to cost
$2000 be purchased for use south of
Market street, and the committee in
dorsed his recommendation. The com-
mittee decided to audit bills only to an
amount which will leave the 156,250
intact for the last three months of
this fiscal year.
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. â¢ SATURDAY. JANUARY 21. 1905.
LEASHMEN FIND
BUT FEW HIRES
Is an Object Lesson to the
Men Who Think Game
Birds Need No Protection
Coursing throughout the State has
been brought almost to a standstill
through lack of hares and the situa
tion should be an object lesson to the
men who think game birds and ani
mals need no protection. It is found
that the hares which overran the Sun
Joaquin Valley some years ago and
were a menace to the farmers h3\e
been exterminated.
Twenty years ago the fields were so
thickly covered with hares that when
the latter were disturbed the whole
face of the earth seemed on the move.
The hares did not mind passing ve
hicles and drivers used to flip them
with their whips as they drove past.
This is all changed now. The spectators
at the recent field trials covered a
large area of ground each day and
saw comparatively few hares.
There has been a systematic cam
paign against the little pests for years
in addition to the building up of the
country. They also command a good
price in the markets for food and
have thus drawn the professional
hunters upon them.
The men who have the appliances
for catching hares for the coursing
parks have gone to Oregon in quest
of hares and a report as to the suc
cess or failure of the venture is ex
pected shortly. The expressage on
each hare shipped from the north will
be 48 cents, which, with the expenses
of the men sent after them, will make
them an expensive luxury.
Two stakes and the holdover events
from last Sunday will make up to
morrow's card at Ingleside Coursing
Park. The park has secured the last
consignment of hares which will come
for some time from the San Joaquin.
The likely winners look to be:
Reserve stakeâLittle Plunder, Shotgun, Miss
Florence, Conroy, Mark Twain, Belvedere,
Slroc, Foxhunter, Sunnybrook, Crawford Belle,
Wild Turkey. Peerless Beauty, Gold Chain,
Ragged Actor, Freeborn. Secretive. Hidden
Hatred, Royal Friend, Miss Domestic and
Bob R.
Class stakeâRenegade Aparhe, Richard An
ton, May Tunison, Friendless Boy, J E H, The
Referee, Lancashire Lad and FVeeport.
E. Reddy's great greyhound Full
Moon will never be coursed again. He
was playing about a yard recently
where some one had left a scythe. He
cut the tendon of one of his hind,
feet so severely that he will be a crip
ple for life.
The first of the Interstate Coursing
Club's meet of the year will be held
at Union Park on February 18 and
19. The Belle Brandon cup for pup
pies of 1904 and the California plate
will make up the card. Owing to the
unsettled condition of coursing none
of the eligible puppies has started
yet.
. Cricketers Will Hold a "Smoker." .
A social entertainment will be given
by the California Cricket Association
in Scottish Hall, Larkin street, on Fri
day evening, the 27th Inst. The affair
is under the management of a com
mittee, consisting of G. Harold Ward,
Chairman; Dr. O. N. Taylor, W. H.
McNaughton, Henry Roberts, A. W.
Wilding and J. D. Robertson... Tickets
may be obtained from any of the fore
going. The San Francisco County
Club will be formally hailed as the
winner of the championship of the
California Cricket Association for the
season of 1904.

PICKWICKS VS. EAGLES

Elevens Are Well Matched
in Tomorrow's Contests
Four matches of , association foot
ball will be played in this part of the
State to-morrow, three being regularly
scheduled contests for the 1904-05
championship of the California League
and the fourth a friendly contest be
tween the Vampire team and an eleven
representing the Santa Cruz Athletic
Club.
At Freeman's Park, Golden Gate,
the Independents will meet the Occi
dentals, Arthur Robinson being the
referee designated by the officers of
the league. Another of the official
referees of the league will be chosen,
for, though Arthur Robinson is all but
universally regarded as the most cap
able referee in California and as en
tirely impartial in his decisions, the
Occidentals, against whom he has
found it necessary to award penalties
of several occasions, have complained
lcudly, both on the field and at meet
ings of the delegates to the league. In
consequence of these attacks Arthur
Robinson has announced that he will
referee no match in which the Occi
dental team is engaged. It is probable
C. W. Irish will referee the Inde
pendent-Occidental match. The ball
will be kicked off at 2:30 p. m. The
game will be a keen one, as the teams
arc strong and each is determined to
beat the other.
On the grounds at Idora Park, Oak
land, the Oakland Hornets will play
against the Albion Rovers. The
Rovers will lack the valuable services
of their captain, P. R. John, who
leaves this city for Portland, Or.,
where he will probably remain for a
year or more. Vice Captain Bayne
will take charge of the team. Before
hit departure his football associates
presented a souvenir to John, who has
been a most useful player in the
Rovers' fullback line. Â»
On the cricket grounds at Alameda
the tail-enders in the championship
table will meet in a vigorous strug
gle, as they are well matched. The
Pickwicks have two points. If the
Eagles can win to-morrow's game they
will tie the Pickwicks' score. The
Eagles have kept steadily on, despite
their continuous defeats, and are im
preving constantly. Henry Roberts
will probably referee, the ball
being kicked off at 2:30 p. m.
The Independents now stand at the
head of the table of results for the
season of the California League, last
Sunday's victory having made their
total score 14 points. The Albion
Rovers also have 14 points, but have
played ten games, whereas the Inde
pendents ? 'have played only eight. In
the table of results given last Satur
day the Eagles received one point for
a tie game with the Occidentals, but
a:? the referee's returns showed the
score 3 to 2 in favor of the Occidentals,
the point has been taken away from
the Eagles. The standing of the clubs
is shown in the table, which includes
the matches played last Sunday:

The Vampire team will leave by the
morning train to-morrow for Santa
Cruz and will return at night. The
eleven will be made up of Rolfe, goal
keeper; Glarner and Petersen, full
backs; Jacques, Turner and Harwood,
halfbacks; V. Holland, Lees, Wilding,
W. Robertson and J. Campsie, for
wards. The Santa Cruz eleven will
consist of W. H. Davenhill, goalkeeper;
McNamara and Owens, fullbacks; D.
Grant, Munn and Jenkins, halfbacks;
Richardson, Sharpe, Davies, H. Grant
and A. Davenhill, forwards. An of
ficial referee of the California League
will accompany the team. ,
The entries for the contest for the
California Association Football Union
cup closed last Sunday and include all
the clubs in the league except the Oc
cidentals. The Oakland Hornets filed
a list of members eligible to play In
the cup ties with Henry Roberts, sec
retary of the C. A. F. Union, but it is
said they will not put a team into the
field. This is much to be regretted, as
its membership list is the largest and
includes many strong players. In
spite, however, of the untiring efforts
of Edgar Pomeroy, a strong, harmoni
ous team has never been presented
during the season.
The Eagle Club, the members of
which are young Americans, who have
taken up association football this sea
son, will give a social entertainment
for the benefit of the club finances In
the Guild Hall of Alameda on Monday
â¦vening, January 30.
Warrant Out for Mrs. Smith.
Mrs. Ada N. Bryant of the Gables,
Clay and Larkin streets, obtained a
warrant from Police Judge Cabaniss
yesterday for the arrest of Mrs. Jo
sephine Smith on a charge of disturb
ing the peace. Mrs. Bryant said Mrs.
Smith called upon her Thursday and
made a disturbance, calling her of
fensive names and accusing Mrs. Bry
ant of being too friendly with her hus
band, Charles Smith, cashier of the
Southern Pacific Company. Mrs.
Smith had previously been refused a
warrant for the arrest of Mrs. Bry
ant on account of the alleged friendly
relations with Mr. Smith. The trou
bles of the Smiths have been for years
aired in the divorce and other courts
and at the last trial for divorce she
appeared as her own counsel.

Tennis Players of Golden
Gate Park to Meet in
a Handicap Tournament
The members of the Golden Gate
Tennis Club will hold their first tour
nament of the year to-morrow on ths
park courts. The event was scheduled
for last Sunday, but had to be post
poned on account of rain. As there
are about eighty players entered it will
take several Sundays to complete the
tourney.
With the handicaps arranged as they
are the poorer players stand little
chance of getting far. It is safe to say
the men playing from scratch or be
low will carry off the prizes. The
largest handicap allowed is "15 3-6."
Seven players are on this mark, but
they are nearly all beginners. Several
of the first-class men are considerably
below scratch, but "owe" odds are
easier to give.
The most heavily handicaped players
are George Baker and R. N. Whitney.
These two men will play from "15 3-6"
below scratch. They have little to fear
from the men above scratch, but there
are players at "owe 15" and "owe 3-6"
who will make them extend themselves
to win. George Janes, the clever young
player who has worked his way to the
top at the California Club, will receive
odds of "owe 3-6" from either Baker or
Whitney, should he meet them. Many
are' of the opinion that Janes should be
playing from the "owe 15 3-6" mark.
MelviHe Long, who has always played
above scratch at the park, has been
put down to "owe 3-6." Long has im
proved considerably since the last
tournament at the public courts, and
even from this mark has a good chance
to win.
Harold Gabriel is another youngster
whose chances are excellent. He is as
clever as Long, but escaped the eyes
of the handicapper and was placed at
scratch. Like Long, he has improved
wonderfully in the last two months,
and will prove a hard man to beat.
There are some strong players on the
"owe 15" mark. Aside from Janes
there are Neil Baker. Carl Gardner,
Herbert Long and Clarence Griffin.
Charles Foley and Charles Dunlap are
also on this mark, but are not playing
as strong a game as the others.
Of the men placed at "owe 15 3-6"
Baker looks to have the best chance to
win. His game is better suited to han
dicap conditions than Whitney's, and
he has also the advantage of youth.
Baker plays a steady, safe game, and
looks -to have as good a chance to win
as any other player in the tourney.
There have been several changes in
the continuous tournament at the Cali
fornia Club during the week. In the
first class Carl Gardner has worked his
way from No. 8 to No. 4. Of the men
who started In this class he has ad
vanced the most. He commenced at
No. 13. Harold Gabriel has graduated
from the second class and has gone
ahead of Adams and Smith in the first
class by default. Gabriel made an ex
cellent showing against Dr. McChes
ney in practice in the early part of the
week. The medical expert had to play
his best game to dispose of the young
ster.
Changes are more numerous In the
fourth class than in any of the others.
Knowlton is still at the top. W. Mur
phy has advanced from No. 7 to No. 5.
Dr. Noble has gone back from No. 6 to
No. 7 and M. Little from 6 to 6. B.
Wallace has advanced from 12 to 11.
Following is the standing of the play
ers:
First clasaâG. Janes, W. Collier. R. Cornell,

FORMER LAND RECEIVER
CHARGED WITH CRIME
James F. Thompson of Eureka Ar
rested on Accusation That He
Extorted Illegal Fees.
James F. Thompson, formerly Re
ceiver of the Eureka Land Office, was
arrested yesterday in this city upon a
complaint charging him with using
his office to extort illegal fees of $10
each from Susan A. Rudlen, Levi R.
Lehman, Clarissa Lehman and Wil
11cm R. Finch on their applications to
file entries on land. The complaint re
cites that no such fees are provided for
by law or by the regulations of the
Land Department. The fees were col
lected in 1902.
Thompson said yesterday that the
fees mentioned in the complaint had
been paid to his daughter, Mrs. Min
erva E. Powell. He explained that it
had been his custom and that of his
predecessors to collect In advance from
each applicant $7 50 for advertising
and 110 as a deposit to cover the fee
for "proving up" the claim. This $10,
he said, was placed to the credit of the
applicant. Two years ago Inspector
McMillan informed Thompson that the
collection of this deposit was illegal
and Thompson thereupon ceased to
collect it.
The defendant was released on fur
nishing bonds for $2500. with Mrs.
Minerva E. Powell and W. E. Powell,
her husband, as sureties for his ap
pearance before United States Com

dore, J. C. Brickell; port captain, John

H. G. Toll, has prepared the following
list of nominees for officers during the
coming season: W. G. Morrow, owner
of the sloop Challenger, for commo
dore; J. M. Punnett, owner of the

cumbents of the offices for which they
have been nominated. Fred Raisch is
the retiring port captain and F. A.

names given make up the "regular
ticket," which, after being posted for
the required time, will be balloted
upon at the annual meeting and elec
tion of officers. It is possible that
opposition candidates may be nomi
nated for some of the offices. If this
is done their names will form a
"members' ticket."
The California Yacht Club held Its
annual meeting recently and elected
the following officers to serve during
the coming year: Robert Vincent,
commodore; George S. Williams, vice
commodore; F. V. Dv Bratz, secre

The election was spirited and the con
tests were close in some cases. R is
said the California Yacht Club has
been formally notified that it must
give up its quarters near the Webster
street bridge, the location being re
quired by the railroad company. As
the club already has a platform and
foundation for a house adjacent to the
pier of the Key Route it will probably
erect quarters there.
SURETY WANTS BOARD OF
WORKS TO RETURN BOND
H. C. Tilden Desires Document Cover
ing H-Street Paving Contract,
Which Was Rescinded.
H. C Tilden, one of the sureties on
the bond of the F. M. Yorke Com
pany, which was awarded the contract
to pave H street, yesterday requested
Chester Keough. assistant secretary of
the Board of Public Works, to return
the bond to him, as the contract had
been rescinded because formal author
ity for the work had not been given
by the Board of Supervisors. Keough
informed Tilden that the bond was an
official record and he had no power to
give it back. Tilden then said he
would file a petition for its return at
next Wednesday's meeting of the
Works Board. J. O'Shea, the other
surety on the bond, did not join in
Tilden's request and said he has no
intention of doing so. The report that
the sureties on the Yorke Company's
contract for repairing bituminous
pavements had asked that their bond
be returned had absolutely no founda
tion In fact.I 1QC A Y LI A \1 A D WILL HAVE claude and many other noted flyers

CAPTAIN FORSEE PROVES A SURPRISE
At Long Odds He
Downs Soufriere,
â¢ a Hot Favorite.
Â«
Lady Kent and Piatt
Two Successful
Choices.
. BY FRED E. MULHOLLAND.
.The exhilarating reversal shown by
.Captain Forsee in the concluding mile
â¢purse event at Oakland yesterday was
the only startling feature of the
â port.
Last Wednesday Trainer Bill Carroll
thought the four-year-old could do the
trick in a Aye and a half furlong sprint,
but Bullman failed to land him Inside
.the money. On the strength of this
-poor exhibition the books laid any
where from 12 to 15 to 1 yesterday
about, the Captain.
He had mysterious Charley Bell on
hie back, and in a hard drive beat the
â ? : ' to 6 favorite, Soufriere, a neck.
Bell clearing outriding C. Miller. The
.ftrst choice was plunged on, and the
outsider's victory saved the ring a*heap
.of money. Ink failed to run up to
expectations In the race, finishing an
indifferent third.
. AÂ» on Thursday, only two choices
were successful. The attendance was
large for an off day.
FAVORITE FINISHES SECOND.
'â¢â¢A six-furlong sprint for maiden
three-year-old fillies opened the after
"rioon's racing. Morita. the Napa Stock
Farm entry, was installed favorite, but
fell'easy prey to True Wing. The lat
':ter had Willie Daly in the saddle, and
trt odds, of 5 and 6 to 1 won in a canter.
â¢The favorite was second, three lengths
â¢fcofbre Lucrece. "
..No" fault could be found with the
rtjnriing of the horses in the six and a
. half furlong event. Lady Kent, the fav
orite, with Davis in the saddle, regia
. lered an easy winner after an early
dyive. Dr. Sherman, the second choice,
.disposed of Bard Burns* the third
â  choice, for show honors. Profitable had
.'speed early in the engagement, but
â¢.iuund trJfe clip set too fast.
â¢ Over $. sloppy track Cousin Carrie
could probably have captured the five
and- a half furlong dash. The mare
closed a 13 to 10 favorite and led to
â¢:he paddock. There she displayed dis
tress signals and Hulford, the mount
of Jakey Jones, led her over the mark
more than a length. Davis finished a
' >se third (with Sir Preston. Suburban
Queen retired early in the struggle.
HAVEN RUN IS BEATEN.
Willie Harris* Haven Run struck a
snag ih the mile selling affair, for
which a cheap bunch of platers faced
the barrier. A. 9 to 10 choice, he was
passed on the back stretch by Instru
ment, a 10 to 1 shot, and in a drive the
last sixteenth lost the decision by a
neck. Alarie piloted the winner, on
. which there was a straggling play.
Inspector Munro took the show from
Mr. Farnum.
: Piatt left his field so far behind in
the seven furlong run for three-year
olds, that it looked as if the colt had
â¢slid down from the grand stand roof
and' hit the wire. The Stevens entry
closed a slight favorite over Handy
â¢Bill' and Jakle Jones handled the tiller.
Handy Bill evinced no fancy for the
going, losing the place to Meada, a 10
to 1 shot.
TRACK NOTES.
Jakie Jones piloted two winners.
â¢ Jakie was due to get a move on, as
his work had been far from brilliant
foi a few days past,
Napa Stock Farm horses were
"strongly in evidence at Oakland yes
terday. Both of the winners, Hulford
: .and Captain Forsee, and Morita, which
. ran second, were bred at A. B.
' Spreekels' Xapa establishment,
'. D. Zelinsky's Handy Bill, which fin
ished third in the fifth event, was
claimed for $825 by Charley McCaf
: ferty, owner of San Jose.
'.Major Mansir, which was claimed
from Brinkworth & Co. by Mrs. Hert
gel, has been disposed of to J. A.
â¢Wernberg. The Major is a prominent
. candidate for the Thornton stakes.
VALUABLE COLLIE DIES
AT HANDS OF POISONER
..Mrs, J. P. Norman Loses Her Prise-
Winning Tri-Color Montez Tyche.
Next Show in May.
Ths brutal dog poisoner is again at
work in Berkeley. The latest sufferer
is Mrs. J. P. Norman, who lost her val
uable tri-colored collie Montez Tyche
â¢ last Tuesday by arsenical poisoning.
' This collie won the president's cup in
December, 1903, for the best collie of
her color in the show. Her last victory
was scored in Oakland, where she took
â¢ first prize in her class.
.â¢ The Pacific advisory committee of the
American Kennel Club has been busy
of late disqualifying various individ
â¢ uals guilty of fraud in connection with
canine transactions, or recalcitrant
toward the powers that be in matters
' doggy. A short time ago they disqual
, ifled S. Barnett for issuing fraudulent
pedigrees. John Perry was accused of
: the same crime, but was acquitted of
evil "intent, although his pedigrees were
adjudged to be fabrications.
The latest disqualification was car
. rled out on a wholesale scale, involving
â¢ all the officials of the Spokane Kennel
Club. . John M. Bunn, president;
Claude D. Bond, vice president; A. B.
Jackson, secretary; Albert Benham and
A. L. Crisman, directors, are all dls
qualied for having held a show under
the rules of an association outlawed by
the American Kennel Club.
The San Francisco Kennel Club will
hold its annual dog show this year dur
ing the second week in May. An un
usually large entry is expected. Ne
gotiations are pending with an English
judge.
Graduate Coaches for Stanford.
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Jan, 20.
When the Intercollegiate agreement
committee, which is the alumni board
which arranges the athletic agree
ments between Stanford and Califor
nia, meets next week in San Francis
co to discuss proposed changes in the
athletic agreement Stanford will not
only insist that the clause.whlch now
â  provides for graduate football coaches
be renewed, but that the rule be ex
tended to baseball as well. It is ex
pected California will oppose this
â¢j.lan and will move that the clause
which provides for the system of
graduate coaching be stricken out
'However, if Stanford insists the clause
will have to remain, as the agreement
says the rule is to stand unless both
universities vote for a change.

The Llssak handicap, at a mile, with
12060 added by the New California I
Jockey Club, is the big attraction at j
Oakland this afternoon. Claude and I
Elliott, representing Mike Daly, will
likely have first call in the betting,
even though the former great horse is
asked to carry 135 pounds. Bom
bardier is a good mudlark and with any
sort of fair racing luck looks to pos
sess a great chance. P. Ryan's crack
mare. Honiton, has a world of speed,
and, even with 123 pounds up, may
steal an early lead which will prove

Twin Sullivan Will Not Come West.
BOSTON, Mass., Jan. 20.âMike
(Twin) Sullivan has thrown up his
match with "Spider" Welch in San
Francisco. He was to have started %or
the Pacific Coast yesterday, but after
mature deliberation he decided he
would be a loser, even though he won
the bout. Besides he reasoned if he
did go on with the match it would
again place him in the preliminary
class, when he wants nothing but main
bouts.

cision there shall be no appeal.
The board of directors shall be the sols
Judge of what constitutes.a professional event.
If this is adopted Berger must either
retire from the club or from the ring.
The club will render valuable assist
ance at th* forthcoming exhibtion in

number of members will appear in ath

BELMONT DECLARES AGAINST
WESTERN JOCKEY CLUB
Latter's Edict of Outlawing for
Horses. Owners and Jockeys Does'
Not Hold In the East.
CHICAGO, Jan. 20.â1n one trenchant
sentence August Belmont, the New
York financier and head of the great
controlling turf body of this country,
gave the turf world as much to think
about to-day as he did the clvio trans
portation bodies with his speech on
Chicago's traction system last night.
He said:
"As for the 'so-called outlaw horses,
owners, trainers and Jockeys, such as
were condemned in the West last year
for racing at Union Park, St. Louis,
by the Western Jockey Club, they
shall never be denied the privileges of
courses under our jurisdiction."
A great deal of terror, inspired by the
Western Jockey Club's ponderous edict
of outlawry, is taken away by the
knowledge that, except in cases of
fraud, any Western owner may race in
the East.
tit doesn't hurt the fellow with the
glass eye to have a pane in his Head.
JIMMY BRITT
AS A LITIGANT
Sues Amusement Company
for j Damages for Using
Name Without Permission
James Edward Britt, pugilist, has
placed a pries upon his reputation as
a vaudevillian. It seems an insignifi
cant price, too, considering the draw
ing capacity of James Edward as a
mitt-wielder In engagements requiring
no other scenery than padded posts, two
strands of rope and some one to hit.
James does not refer to the prize ring
dope book for proof of his value as a
stellar theatrical attraction. He mere
ly says his services behind the foot
lights are in great demand, and he can
not afford to deceive the dear public
by permitting himself to be advertised
as an interlocutor in a free minstrel
show.
On this account James Edward Britt,
by his attorneys, Louis Ferrari and
John J. Greely, late last evening filed
a suit for $10,000 damages and an in
junction against the Belvedere Music
Hall Company. The basis of the action
is found in a red and black poster an
nouncing a minstrel show at the Bel
vedere. Near the bottom of the- sheet
is a picture of Britt with the announce
ment that for one night he will appear
as interlocutor. Perhaps Jimmy draws
the color line on minstrelsy, or maybe
he will not appear where he is not a
head-liner. At any rate, he alleges,
the posters have been hung in saloons
and other resorts without his consent,
and with the preconceived intent to de
fraud him of the benefits and profits
that would conte from the demand for
his services. He says that for three
years he has been giving boxing exhi
bitions in theaters and has established a
reputation for merit. His services have
been in demand, and there have' been
some large profits. The hanging of the
Belvedere posters, says the pugnacious
plaintiff, is intended to deceive the
community at large, and he arks the
court for an order that each and all of
the posters be torn down and destroyed
and the music hall company restrained
from further advertising him as one
of its attractions.
After the complaint was filed Britt's
attorneys went at once to the home of
Judge Seawell for a temporary re
straining order.
Hauser to Captain Reliance Club.
Herbert Hauser has been elected cap
tain of the Reliance Athletic Club of
.Oakland. The club will have a strong
track team this year and also a good
basketball team. It will hold an in
door meet in March. The club will play
a prominent part in all amateur sports
this year. The gymnasium is crowded
on class nights.

FIRE CHIEFS FAVOR
A TWELVE-HOUR DAY
Sentiment Among the Rank and File
of the Department Also Indorses
Senator Wolfe's Bill.
The general sentiment of the mem
bers of the rank and file of the Fire
Department is in favor of the change
in the working time of the firemen
proposed by Senator Edward I. Wolfe
at Sacramento. The bill introduced by
Senator Wolfe provides that the men
of the department be divided into two
shifts of twelve hours each, instead of
spending their entire time at the en
gine-houses, as is now the rule.
Chief Sullivan called a meeting sev
eral days ago of the battalion chiefs to
discuss the proposed legislation. From
the investigations made by them they
found that the twelve-hour day was
unanimously indorsed. Subsequently
Chief Sullivan forwarded all the data
in his possession for the information
of Senator Wolfe.
Battalion Chief Shaughnessy said
that the chiefs had always favored
such legislation and thought the ef
ficiency of the department would be
Improved by allowing the men home
life. The legislation, he added, would
call for a few extra men for the night
shift, but the hours proposed would
permit more men to be on duty in each
engine-house during the watches.
The Fire Commissioners held a reg
ular weekly meeting yesterday after
noon, but owing to the absence of
Commissioner Wreden on account of
sickness, no election of a president
took place.
Charges were ordered filed against
Hoseman J. J. Deeney for failure to re
port for duty when ordered to do so by
Battalion Chief Fernandez. Salary was
allowed Captain William Schultz,
who, while acting as battalion chief,
was thrown from a buggy several
months ago and severely injured.
The following probationary firemen
were made members of the depart
ment: H. J. Temple, Engine 36; Wil
lie m M. Mullen, Engine 37; J. J.
Douglas, Engine 33; M. J. Cannon, En
gine 19; A. H. Spiegel, Engine 10; T. J.
Sheehan and John G. Balletto, En
gine 9.
SIR CHARLES H. TUPPER
QUESTIONS EXPERT DWYER
/
Dunsmuir Hearing Moves Slowly Be
fore Consul Courtenays Bennett
as Commissioner.
The taking of testimony in the
Dunsmuir case is still dragging along
before British Constil Bennett as com
missioner. Both sessions yesterday
were taken up with the rigid cross
examination of J. J. Dwyer by Sir
Charles H. Tupper. As on Thursday,
the- probate law of the State was the
issue under discussion.
The monotony of the afternoon ses
sion was broken by a controversy be
tween Attorney C. S. Wheeler and the
Canadian barrister, representing Mrs.
Joan Dunsmuir. Wheeler, who is at
torney for Executor James Dunsmuir,
intimated that Sir Charles was mis
leading the witness by his questioning.
Sir Charles replied that he was simply
trying to get true statements from the
witness from the standpoint that
Dwyer was there to testify as an ex
pert. He added with much emphasis
and dignity that "he had never at
tempted to mislead or deceive the wit
ness," and then with a smile and a
wave of his hand said: "We'll resume
our mutton." *
Whether J. A. S. Lowe" is again to
appear before the court has not yet
been decided by Attorney Luxton, who
still has the matter under advisement.
The court will meet at 10 o'clock
this morning and will be in session
until 1 p. m., when it will adjourn for-
the day.
Edna Wallace Hopper has not yet
appeared at any of the sessions.

HEATHEN USES
FAMOBS PUNCH
Ah Wing Revives La Blanche
Back Swing and Puts Man
uel Torres Down and Out
â¦â-
HOrSE. IN AN UPROAR
Carroll Beats Sullivan and
Christie Loses to How
ard in a Fierce Battle
The famous old time La Blanche
swing or pivot blow was revived last
night by the only heathen champion of
the ring. Ah Wing. The Celestial was
getting his from the little negro, Man
uel Torres, when he suddenly tore off
that pivot wallop In the second round
and the' black lad rested heavily on the
mat.
It was the first time many of the
spectators had seen the once noted
punch that has been barred for years.
To think the heathen champ should
revive the wallop made many of the
old-timers a bit Jealous. The house
1 presented an asylum-like aspect when
the Mongolian put his man to the floor.
Men got up in the seats and yelled for
a fare-ye-well.
Wing got Into the game when the bell
clanged and kept after nls man. The
latter was there with a straight left
and was making a fool of the little
Chink when he .brought the haymaker;
over. It landed just right. Wing was
as much surprised as the spectators
and did not recover his self-possession
till after he got through challenging
any amateur in the world at 118
pounds.
The main event %vas not half as in
teresting. Joe Carroll was declared the
winner against Tom Sullivan, though
no one seemed to care much either
way. The men fought suspiciously and
the fanÃ thought they were framing
one on them. Sullivan seemed to be
leading for the first two rounds, for
Carroll fought in dopey style, letting
his opponent get inside his guard and
landing straight lefts to the face.
Carroll woke up a bit during the last
two periods and the way he finished
got him the coin. Sullivan slowed up
noticeably and several times almost
refused to fight. Carroll did not use
his famous left to advantage, doing a
lot of mixing Instead.
Kid Christie and Brick Howard put
up the best fight of the night. Howard
made a hit from the start when he
waded into his vicious opponent and
kept after him. Both men were grog
gy several times and It was anybody's
fight till the last round, when Howard
waded in and won. Charlie Dunn was
awarded a decision over George San
franson he did not deserve. The latter
showed a lot of class over Dunn and
was winning all the way. Dunn forced
the going in the last round and was
given the verdict to the tune of the
hisses of those present.
Mike Synfy made Jimmy Kelly quit
In two rounds with a couple of blows
to the stomach. Harry Riley's showing
against Billy Stanton disappointed the
crowd. He barely won and came near
being beaten. Denny O'Connell won a
close decision over Jim Bradley in the
curtain raiser.
Quill Gets Horse Military.
OAKLAND, Jan. 20.â8y a ruling
made in the Superior Court to-day the
racehorse Military is the property of
D. J. Quill, while James F. Monahan,
the former owner, has lost his horse
through the acts of Max Gutter, who
Judge Hall said to-day he believed
had perjured himself and swindled
both Quill and Monahan. Monahan
testified that he had given Gutter a
bill of sale of the horse to secure him
for $220 advanced by Gutter for feed
and necessary expenses. The horse
won a purse on December 24 at a
long price and when Quill put in his
claim to the money Monahan resisted
it. The Jockey Club still retains the
purse, awaiting a settlement of the
dispute. The testimony to-day showed
that Gutter had told Quill he could
buy the horse for $100 and Quill had
put up the money.
Grandmother Gets Children.
Another hearing was had in Judge
Graham's court yesterday on the pe
tition of Mrs. Cynthia Markle of San
ta Rosa for the guardianship of her
two little granddaughters, Cynthia
and Sybil Brown. The court decided
that she should keep the girls until
April 1, when further inquiry will be
made. The father and mother of the
children, Frederick and Lavinia
Brown, were divorced, but are living
together again, against the objections
of Mrs. Brown's mother. At the time
of the divorce the husband agreed to
pay $40 a month for the support of
the children, but the grandmother
charges that the daughter spent the
money for herself. During the hear
ing Mrs. Markle bitterly reproached
her daughter for her behavior.
Commission Merchant Is Arrested.
C. M. Carroll, a fruit and vegetable
commission merchant, was booked at
the City Prison yesterday by Detec
tive Whitaker on a charge of passing
a fictitious check. It is alleged that
on January 15 Carroll called at the
M. & M. liquor house, 34 East street,
owned by McQuald & Ellsworth, and
presented a check for $945 on the
Stockton Savings Bank, bearing the
signature of "Hopkins & Rowe." He
said he wanted $60 badly and that
sum was given him. McQuaid of
fered him more if he needed it and
he replied that $200 would about fix
him. McQuaid, on second thought,
telegraphed to the Stockton Savings
Bank and received a reply that no
such firm as Hopkins & Rowe was
known there.
Chief Hewitt Files Report.

FRAME .RESOLUTIONS
Indorse Senator Balston's
Bill in Regard to Stop
ping Professional Boxing
The Pacific Athletic Association,
which comprises sixteen amateur or

of California. A copy of the resolutions
will be sent to each member of the Leg

to stamp out amateurs who are sailing
under false colors. The resolutions fol
low:
Whereas, Amateur boxing as conducted in
the Stats of California and particularly In the
city and county of San Francisco by the s >-
called amateur boxing clubs is, on a purely
professional basis, the contestants receiving
cash prizes in sums from $30 to $150; and
Whereas. Under the prevailing conJHians
amateur boxing has become degraded and ths
coming generation of athletes Is becoming Â»>
that it these conditions are not
discontinued the clean amateur athletics will
become a thing of the past; and

Pacific Athletic Association of the Amateur
Athletic Union that It Is Impossible to conduct
amateur boxing under the supervision of local
Beards of Supervisors; therefore, be It
Resolved, That this association commends ths
action of Senator Ralston in his efforts to

alism; and be It further
Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions
be forwarded to every bona fide amateur ath

CHINA ACTING
IN GOOD FAITH
Official of Foreign office
at Peking Gives Assurance
of Neutrality of Empire
COMPLAINTS OF RUSSIA
Says Czar's Note to Powers
Is Intended to Furnish
Pretext for Compensation
PEKING, Jan. 20âA high official of
the Foreign Office said to-day that the
neutrality of China was just as much
assured now as it had been at any time
during the war. The Chinese Govern
ment, he said, had taken every possible
precaution to fulfill the obligations of
a neutral, and he could only suppose
that the complaints of the Russian
Government in its note to the powers
were intended to constitute pretexts in
the future for compensation for the
loss of Port Arthur.
The official emphatically denied that
there was a*ny connection between the
question of neutrality and that of the
anti-foreign agitation in China, and as
an instance he pointed to the prompt
suppression of attempted riots at
Shanghai in relation to the punishment
of the sailor belonging to the Russian
cruiser Askold, who killed a native on
December 15 as the result of a dispute
over the hire of a jinriksha.
INCLINES TOWARD JAPAN.
Personal Sympathy of President With
the Little Brown Men.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20.âThere are
certain facts about the relation of the
United States to the Russo-Japanese
war which force themselves upon the
attention of any one who closely fol
lows the progress of diplomacy in
Washington. There is not a European
Embassador whose chief and secreta
ries are alert which has not reported
to its Foreign Office that the personal
sympathy of President Roosevelt is
strongly inclined toward Japan. It is
accepted in diplomatic circles that the
officials of the State Department con
sider Russian supremacy the worst
thing possible for' American diplomacy
In the Far East.
The Japanese Minister, M. Kotroro
Takahira, since recovering from a se
vere illness in New York has called
at the State Department more fre
quently than any other member of the
diplomatic corps.
Russia has been purposely or acci
dentally an adversary of American
diplomacy In the Far East as man
aged by Hay ever since the Boxer out
break in 1900, when Hay Initiated his
famous policy in support of the "open
door" in Manchuria and the integrity
of China.
United States Minister Conner re
ported in 1903 that Russia tried to
thwart the Chinese-American commer
cial treaty.
The situation to-day is: Russia is
distrusted; Japan is accorded childlike
faith. No one at the State Department
believes in the "yellow peril," which is
the fear entertained by many persons
that unless Europe and America "kept
the lid on" in the Orient, Japanese ini
tiative and dash will lead the latent
power of 450,000,000 Chinese to a propa
ganda of "Asia for the Asiatics" and
all European interests will be literally
thrown out of the Orient.
General Stoessel Leaves Shanghai.
SHANGHAI, Jan. 20.âGeneral and
Madame Stoessel and a large number
of the paroled Russian officers and or
derlies from Port Arthur, who arrived
here yesterday from Nagasaki on the
French steamer Australlen, left on that
vessel to-night.
Russia Purchases a Sea-Going Tug.
KIEL, Germany, Jan. 20.âThe large
sea-going Dutch tug Zwarte Zee has
been sold by Consul Diedrichsen to
Russia. She has already left ,bere to
accompany the third Russian Pacific
squadron to the Far East.
Will Dam Entrance to Port Arthur.
TOKIO, Jan. 20.â1t has been pro
posed to dam the entrance to the har
bor of Port Arthur preparatory to salv
ing the Russian war vessels.
Warships Off the Lankava Islands.
PENANG, Jan. 20.âFour Japanese
warships are reported to be in the vi
cinity of the Lankava Islands, forty
miles north of Penang.
â¦
British Steamer Is Confiscated.
NAGASAKI. Jan. 20.âThe British
steamer Lethington has been con
demned by the naval prize court at
Sasebo.
The Lethington was captured on Jan
uary 12 in the Tsushima Straits by the
Japanese torpedo-boat destroyer No. '72.
She had a cargo of coal on board and
was bound, it is said, to Vladivostok.
She was taken by her captor to Sasebo
for trial by the naval court in session
there.
WILL WATCH RUSSIANS.
England Is Sending Forty-Two Offl- |
cors to the Orient.
Among yesterday's arrivals at the '
Palace Hotel was Captain Donald S. ;
Vance of the British army, who is on
his way to the Orient, where he will
join the Japanese forces as a military
observer. The captain is one of forty
two officers who are being sent to
Japan on the same mission and are
going by different routes, some by the
Canadian Pacific, others by the South
ern Pacific and others by way of the
Santa Fe, in order not to excite spe
cial attention.
The motive of the British Govern
ment in sending them to the Far East
at this particular stage oBT the Jap
anese-Russian war is said to be the
anticipation of a possibility of Great
Britain's becoming involved in the
present war. In that event the latter i
country would be possessed of valu
able knowledge of the scene of war, '
a fact that would greatly aid her in i
operating her troops in 'the Orient i
The instructions of the officers now
being sent to the front are to gather i
every possible bit of information re- i
garding the topographical condition
of the Oriental country and to study ,
carefully the Russian methods and
means 1n warfare, with a view to ac
quainting the home government. 1
Captain Vance is a young officer and i
recently married a Philadelphia'
heiress. His bride is accompanying |
him to the Orient and will remain in
one of the large Japanese cities while
her husband is fulfilling his instruc
tions at the front.
Arbitration Treaty With Sweden.
WASHINGTON. ' Jan. 20.âSecre
tary Hay and Minister Grip of Swe
den and Norway to-day signed an ar
bitration treaty between this country
and Norway and Sweden. It is pat
terned after the arbitration treaties
now before the Senate.
CASTRO DELAYS
SENDING REPLY
Ruler of Venezuela Leaves
Caracas to Avoid Answer
ing Note of United States
PATIENCE IS EXHAUSTED
Uncle Sam May at Length Be
Compelled to Resort to
Some Compulsory Measure
I PARIS, Jan. 20.âInformation reach
ing authoritative quarters here from
Caracas, Venezuela, says President
Castro has decided to give a negative
J reply to the representations of the
United States. The President has left
Caracas for a fortnight with the evi
dent intention of putting off an Imme
diately reply.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 20.âThe in
formation respecting the situation
at Caracas received by the State
Department from Minister Bowen is to
the effect that President Castro made a
proposition for the settlement of the
asphalt and other issues between the
United States and Venezuela of a na
ture that makes it impossible of ac
ceptance by our Government, and,
being notified of that facL and having
left the capital for an Ts.definite pe
riod, he has terminated the negotia
tions at least for the time being. The
effect of this action is to place the re
lations between the United States and
, Venezuela under a decided strain.
Though it is now almost certain that
some action of a compulsory nature
will in the end be forced upon our Gov
ernment, this will not occur until every
resource of diplomacy has been ex
hausted.
The position of the State Department,
beyond the statement that it has found
Castro's proposal unacceptable, has not
been definitely laid down. Further in
formation from the American Minister
at Caracas is awaited as a basis for
future action. Meantime, Attorney
General Moody.through his assistant,
Mr. Russell, is making a careful in
quiry to ascertain whether all of the
proceedings in the last few years before
the Venezuelan courts respecting the
asphalt controversy have been con
ducted according to the established le
gal procedure in Venezuela and to as
certain whether or not there has been a
technical as well as an actual denial of
justice to the complainants. The pur
pose of the President in adopting this
course is to arm himself with well
considered opinions on the highest legal
authority in the executive branch of
the Government of the United States
before resorting to compulsory meas
ures in the case of Venezuela.
The State Department authorities feel
\ that they have been patient and long
[ suffering in this matter. Mr. Pulldo,
| who until a few days ago was Charge
d'Affaires of the Venezuelan Legation
and was succeeded by Mr. Veloz, Sec
j retaxy of the Bureau of American Re
i publics, received a cablegram from his
. Government announcing his appoint
' ment as First Secretary of Legation,
the position he formerly held. This
means that Mr. Pulido will continue on
duty in Washington. He called at the
State Department to-day to ask if any
S formation had been received regard
g the arbitration of the asphalt case.
Hp has had no recent advices on this
subject. It appears that Mr. Veloz is
! appointed Charge d'Affaires on a spe
| cial mission.

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK, Jan. 20. âConstraint was
manifest on the speculative spirit of the stock
market to-day and the tone was heavy and
dull for the greater part of the time. The
positive weakness, however, of the opening
dealings which came pver from the preceding
day, was soon dissipated. The pressure cen
tered largely In Amalgamated Copper owing to
disappointment over the dividend declaration.
. .'Ye amount of the distribution was what had
â¢&?en generally expected, but disappointment
whs felt that the style of the dividend was not
made regular 1 per cent quarterly instead of
.halfâ¢ of 1 per cent regular and half of 1 per
cent' extra, which was felt to Imply a question
as iq the maintenance of the rate. The stock
was forced down an extreme 1% aA$ without
malting a recovery was effectively supported
above the low point. Brooklyn Rapid Transit
reflected a revised view of the recommenda
tions yesterday to the State Railroad Commis
. Hion for the improvement of the system and its
decline was arrested. While ths market was
saved 'from the sympathetic Influence of con
tinued weakness in these stocks, there seemed
a continued weight on it and the notable ad
vances in special cases were not effective in
reviving the Btrength and activity. More ef
fect than usual was produced by the disquiet
of foreign securities markets on account of the
ili'sturbances in Russia. There was consider
able selling- of stock here for foreign account,
but the sentimental effect of the situation
Was' of even more Influence. Great Interest
w.as shown in the news of the conferences be
tween Pennsylvania Railroad officials and em
ployes in the effort to adjust the labor dispute
and the uncertainty as to the result had Its
Â«>fTect in repressing activity in stocks. Reports
of gross earnings In railroads for the second
week in January showed a considerable falling
.eft in'the recently prevailing levnal of earnings
vvwh the mixture of losses compared with last
..vear. bringing the average for seventeen rail
road*, reporting to an actual decrease of over
2 per eÂ«>nt from last year's level. But the
movement of special railroads was clearly
based on the hope of Increased returns from
dividends. This was notably the case with
the '"hicago and Northwestern stocks, for
*hich encouragement Is given by the recent
advance In tbe dividend rate on Chicago, St.
.F*ul. 'Minneapolis and Omaha which is a
subsidiary stock. An inference seemed to be
drawn of a hope for more liberal dividend al
lowances among the Venderbilt properties gen
erally. New York Central Itself was notably
strong and there was response also In Canada
.Southern, Cleveland, Chicago, Cincinnati and
St. Louis, both common and preferred; Peoria
and Eastern and Lake Erie and Western. The
violent rise in the Chicago Terminal stocks
was'understood to be related to a pending plan
f<>r a reorganisation, but no news was forth
coming on that subject. There were a imm<
"ber .of notable gains among the specialties
and minor railroads, but In the standard list
Pt. -Paul end Louisville and Nashville were
about -the only stocks to show appreciable
strength. The sluggishness of the general list
was not modified by the forf-casts of the
wr-ek's currency movement indicating another
gain in cash of upward of $6,000,000. Infer
ences unfavorable to the activity of Interstate
trade are suggested by the heavy congestion
of funds here. The rushing up of Reading to
89% In the last half hour of the market was
only slightly more successful than previous
movements in stiffening the tone generally and
the closing was Irregular and active.
'. Bonds were firm. Total sales (par value),
$6,760,000.
United States 4a declined % per cent on call.

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE.
Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Jan! 20.âBuoyed up by an un
expectedly firm market at Liverpool, wheat
opened here at a slight gain, May being un
changed to %c higher at $1 14%Â®1 14%. At
the start there was a fair demand from com
mission houses. Offerings were rather light.
After May had touched $1 14%Â©1 14% prices
suddenly 3tarte<f downward and the decline
wxs not checked until May had sold oft to I
$1 13%. The poor demand for cash wheat |
at all centers was said to be .the fundamental j
reason for the heavy tone of the speculative ;
market. Another influence that contributed to
the weakness here was the liberal movement
of wheat from Argentina. Nevertheless, pit |
sentiment gradually lost much of its bearish- j
ness. One or two prominent operators became
fairly active buyers. Many of the smaller ;
traders wlio had sold freely on the early I
weakness covered their sales and helped causa
a slow recovery, ihe market became active
and strong during the last hour, winding up
higher than yesterday, with prices at the |
top. The final quotation on May was $1 15.
Influenced by higher cables, the corn mar- i
ket was Arm with a fairly active business.
May closed unchanged at 44%@46c.
Sentiment in the oats pit was governed
principally by the action of the corn market.
May opened a shade to %c higher at 31 %c i
and closed unchanged. !
The provisions market was firm. Trading
was not particularly active, but buying orders
were numerous enough to absorb all offerings
without the necessity of any cut In prices. At
the close May rork was up 12% c; lard and ,

best stock, there being a scarcity of strictly
fancy Salinas and Oregon Burbanks. Receipts
of river Burbanks were light, but there was
no scarcity, as the wharves were still loaded
with old stock. Trade In that description was
quiet, but previous prices were still asked by
the principal handlers, who controlled the bulk
of the available supplies. There were no fresh
arrivals of Sweets and carried-over stock ruled
Arm at the recent advance. The Onion mar
ket was strong, with fancy stock In limited
supply and higher.
There were liberal arrivals of southern vege
tables, but prices of choice stock were well
maintained. A large portion of the receipts
of Peas and Beans still showed the effects of
the recent rain In the growing districts, and
such stock was slow of sale. \

Poultry and Game.

crn stock available, there was continued firm
ness In everything except Turkeys. About 40
cases*, of dressed Turkeys came in and thera
were quite a few cases carried over from the
preceding day. The demand was very light, aa
retailers were complaining of the poor quality
of the stock, which Is always more or less
"grassy" at this time of the year. .Game

receipts were light and the demand brisk, there
was a general advance In prices.

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Butter still ruled firm yesterday and several
houses quoted 1c over the top quotation below,
but the majority quoted no change, and-sev
era! reported that they had bought below 26c.
The general conditions therefore, remained
about as before. Stocks of fine creamery are
still closely cleaned up.
Cheese is showing weaker symptoms and
dealers are offering to sell among themselves
at concession*. Stocks are not very large, but
the demand is slow.
Another decline in Eggs seems impending,
and in fact ranch were quoted a shade lower
yesterday. Some houses were discounting the
future by offering to sell for next week's de
livery three or four cents under top quotations
below. Receipts were considerably larger, aa
Will be seen.
Receipts were 41,400 lbs Butter, 60S cases
Eggs and 22,500 lbs Cheese.

desirable alses of choice sold fairly at $1 350
1 80. while the large sizes of fancy, which
constituted tbe bulk of the offer!of* of that
grade, met with a sluggish demand, with a
few sales reported at the top quotation. A car

been sold at the auction sale, but owing to
the light demand for*-high-grade fruit it was
withdrawn. Two oars were sold aa follows:

FIREMAN FALLS
THREE STORIES
Charles Nolan, While Fight
ing- Fire, Drops Through
an Open Elevator Shaft
ROBERT WOODS INJURED
Bonestell, Richardson & Co.,
Paper Manufacturers, Lose
Heavily Through Flames
Fire broke out in the building oc
cupied by Bonestell, Richardson & Co.,
manufacturers at 401 Sansome
street, last evening, and before the de
partment succeeded in extinguishing
! the blaze, damage to the extent of
j $80,000 had been done. Two firemen
were injured while the fire raged. Rob
ert Woods of Truck 1 was badly cut
about the face and hands by glass.
Charles Nolan of Fire Patrol No. 3
dropped three stories through an ele
vator shaft and miraculously escaped
with several broken ribs and a larcer
ated scalp.
When the fire was discovered by a
patrolman it was burning on the sec
ond floor. An alarm was turned in and
when the first relay of engines came to
the scene it appeared as if the fire was
an easy one to master. The contrary
| proved to be true, however, and as soon
las the flames crept to the third and
fourth floors Chief Sullivan ordered ad
ditional alarms sent in.
In a few moments flames broke out
from many portions of the four-story
structure and the fire was on in all its
fury. The water tower was placed in
position on Sansome street, and three
water batteries were lined up on Sac
ramento street. With the supply from
this apparatus the floors were deluged
In a short time and the fire died out.
Fireman Woods was climbing a lad
der near a window when an explosion
of gas caused the glass to break and
spread in his direction. Though cut
and bruised, Woods made his way to
the ground and was taken to the Har
bor Receiving Hospital, where his in
juries were treated. Charles Nolan of
; the Are patrol was on the third floor
| when he accidentally stumbled into an
j elevator shaft, and when he was picked
|up on the ground floor by fellow fire
â¢ men he was unconscious. An examina
! tion at the hospital, however, showed
| that Nolan was not seriously Injured
and he will be sent home very soon.
The building, which was to a great
I extent destroyed, is the property of
1 Jonas Schonfeldt. Insurance will cover
the loss on the building, which is esti
: mated at between $5000 and $7000. The
I paper house will lose over $70,000, as
all of the stock was either burned or
| damaged by water. According to the
[ managers about -80 per cent of this
i amount is insured.
DINGEE'S ATTORNEY MOVES
TO QUASH CONTEMPT ORDER
President of Contra Costa Water Com
pany Not In CourtâMrs. Center
Claims Default.
William J. Dingee was not in Judge
Kerrigan's court at the appointed hour
yesterday to answer to an order to
show cause why he should not be pun
ished for contempt, but he was repre
sented by Garret W. McEnerney, who
moved that the proceedings be
quashed. The motion was argued and
Judge Kerrigan will decide it next
week. McEnerney's point was made
upon the insufficiency of the affidavit.
This he said did not show that Dingee
had been served with summons to ap
pear before a notary to give his depo
sition in the suit of Jeanne D. Center
against him and the Contra Costa Wa
ter Company, In which it is charged
that Dingee misappropriated $295,000
under the guise of purchasing titles
and settling litigation.
Mrs. Center was in court with her
attarney, W. D. Baggett, who con
tended that there was sufficient evi
dence of the service in the fact that
Dingee had appeared by representa
tives before the notary and obtained a
continuance. Said Baggett: "Dingee
is no better than any one else and
there is no reason why he should not
Ipomply with the law of the land."
McEnerney was ready to argue his
demurrers to Mrs. Center's complaint,
but Baggett said he would first move
to strike them from the files and enter
a default of the defendants because
there had been no appearance in their
behalf. He declared the court had im
properly granted several continuances
of their time to plead without an ap
pearance having been made. He had
demanded an entry of the default from
the County Clerk, but the latter had
refused to make it on account of the
continuances granted. The matter
went over for a week.
BANKS TURN OVER CASH
FOR BONDS TO THE # CITY
Treasurer McDougald Receives Near
ly a Million Dollars for Portion
of Securities.
. A busy scene was witnessed yester
day in the city treasury, when the
banking syndicate which has pur
chased a block of the new municipal
bonds turned in nearly a million dol
lars to pay for the securities. The
Mutual Bank hauled in bags contain
ing $328,687 in gold to pay for the
entire issue of the Golden Gate Park'
and Presidio Extension bonds. The
odd $637 is for accrued Interest on
the bonds from January 1 to January
20.
The Bank of California paid in
$240,466 67 for a part issue of the
children's playground bonds, of which
$466 67 is for accrued interest. The
German Bank parted with $292,567 78
for the entire issue of the Mission
Park bonds, of which $667 78 is ac
crued interest.
The work of signing the bonds waa
resumed by the Mayor, Treasurer and
Auditor, and it is expected that the
portion which the banking syndicate
desires to take up will be ready for
delivery in a day or two. As there
was some delay in the signing of the
bonds City Treasurer McDougald is is
suing receipts to the banks stating
that the bonds will be turned over to
the syndicate before February 1, 1905.

LAWYERS' TALK
BODES TROUBLE
Collins Says He Will Hold
Sullivan Accountable in
Person for Strong Words
ATTACK BEFORE JURY
George Monnier's Attorney
Scores Opponent in Court
and Redress Is Promised
An affair of honor between Matt I.
Sullivan and George D. Collins, oppos
ing attorneys in the Monnier case, is to
be settled after the final adjournment
of the trial, which may be to-day. A
promise to this effect was made by
Collins yesterday morning, when he de
clared in court that he would hold Sul
livan personally accountable for per
sonal remarks made in the course of
'his address to the jury.
Sullivan had nursed his rage over
certain charges of Collins that Theo
dore Roche, Sullivan's associate in the
case, had manufactured evidence in
behalf of George Monnier Jr. When
the senior counsel got before the jury
he entered into a defense of his young
assistant. He rebuked Collins for his
attack, and then mentioned the dis
barment proceedings against his ad
versary. He said: "They charged
thievery, perjury and crime which
would place him behind the peniten
tiary bars." The angry attorney de
clared that Roche, though young and a
mere boy, was far ahead of Collins,
and would be heard of as one of the
leading attorneys at the bar; his word
would be taken in the Supreme Court
before that of Collins. "I have prac
ticed for twenty-five years in the courts
of this State, and have never had occa
sion to attack a lawyer on the other
side before," said Sullivan. "I have
been in controversy with the greatest
lawyers of the age, men who held po
sitions most exalted, from Hali McAl
lister and General Barnes down to Jack
Chretien and George D. Collins"âthen,
with bitternessâ"the one in the peni
tentiary, the other out."
Collins arose and said, "I will hold
him personally accountable for his
abuse when this court adjourns. When
he uttered those statements he knew
them to be willful and malicious lies
and misrepresentations."
Then both seemed to talk at once,
Sullivan saying something about "here
and now," and Collins retorted with
evident determination, "this Is no
bluff."
Many expected an encounter would
follow at the noon recess, but Mr. Col
lins, addressing the court, explained
that when he said he would hold Sul
livan accountable after the adjourn
ment he meant the final adjournment
of the case. He did not care to inter
rupt the course of the argument and
get himself into contempt.
At the afternoon session Sullivan
continued his address, analyzing the
testimony, and once or twice he di
gressed to make other reflections upon
Collins, once comparing him with
young Monnier to the latter's advan
tage and discrediting the source of
some of Collins' practice.

are now preparing an order to permit
the sale of all the stock at 32 Fremont
street at auction for a price not less
than 50 per cent of the inventory,
which was $30,000. S. G. Kellogg, at

HOUSEROOFER FINDS MYSTERY
IN HIS SUDDEN MENTAL LAPSE
Loses Watch and Money Wftlfe in State
of Torpor and Causes Arrest
"of Two Working Girts.
SUPPER GUESTS DENY HIS CHARGES
Ralph Scott hinted that his stupe
faction was not the least puzzling fea
ture of the affair. He would not go so
far as to allegeâindeed he was reluct
ant to suspectâthat an opiate had
been surreptitiously administered, be
cause he knew that the defendants had
rot attained the sophisticated stage of
criminality that keeps knockout drops
in constant readiness for emergencies.
Neither could be bring himself to be
lieve that his torpor was entirely the
result of overindulgence in intoxicat-
ing liquors, for he was acquainted with
his capacity as an absorbent of such
fluids and was certain that it had not
been exceeded prior to his visit to ob
livion. His vocation of house-roofer
had inured him to retention of his
mental balance at lofty ' elevations,
where ordinary heads would harbor
dizziness, and the brain strength thus
acquired enabled him to withstand the
influence of spirituous beverages more
easily than it could be resisted by
brains less highly educated.
In brief, he had about relinquished
solution of the mystery of his stupor
as a hopeless task. All he was posi
tively certain of was his awakening to
discover that his $35 watch and $11 in
cash had been abstracted from his
clothing while he lay dormant, and it
was logical that he should suspect â
though reluctantlyâl6-year-old Lil
lian Burgess, 17-year-old Edith Page
and 21-year-old Donald McCloud of
being the pilferers, because they were
with him when he sat down to meat,
having the watch and the money on
his person. They had accompanied
him from the dance at Teutonia Hall,
on Howard street, to a restaurant on
Sixth street, in which his strange lapse
to unconsciousness occurred.
Miss Page and Miss Burgess sat side
by side and hand in hand upon the
bench reserved for female defendants
in Police Judge Mogan's court, and be
hind them in the steel cage sat Mr.
McCloud, peering anxiously between
the bars and occasionally whispering
words of encouragement to his fright
ened co-defendants. The girls were
not of the moral caliber usually oc
cupying that bench and the bailiff's
appreciation of that fact was exempli
fied in various little kindnesses extend
ed. One of the maidens is a laundry
operative, the other toils in a cracker
factory and the male prisoner is em
ployed at the Union Iron Works. It
was at a workingfolks' ball they met
Mr. Scott and accepted his invitation
to supper. Did they rob him?
M-e-r-c-y! How could the Judge ask
such a thing? Their attorney said
that when Mj\ Scott abruptly fell into
sodden slumber he left the supper un
paid for and as the restaurateur was
importunate, and as they had no money,
they did take from their host's store of
silver enough to pay the bill, but not a
cent more. As for the watch alleged
to have been stolen, they had never
seen it.
Then, to the great joy of many fe
male relatives and friends of the girls,
the hearing was continued till next
Monday and each of the defendants
admitted to bail in the sum of $100.

When the Emergency Hospital sur

Mr. Johnson's head with a baseball bat,
the blow being so violent as to effect
a skull fracture and destroy his hear
ing. The surgeons are undecided
whether the aural injury is permanent.
Miss Clark was before Judge Mogan
last Wednesday on the charge of dis
turbing the peace by addressing un
complimentary language to Mrs. Ma
thilda Stone, a Caucasian matron, re
siding at 2221 Beach street, between
Broderick and Baker, and next door to
the home of the defendant. The de
fense entered a nlea of provocation, al
leging that Miss Clark was harassed
and annoyed by her white neighbors,
who had evidently conspired t8 rid the
neighborhood of her presence, and that
Mrs. Stone waÃ one of the most active
persecutors. A continuance of the
hearing was asked for and granted till
next week, and the following day Miss
Clark, who had been released on bail,
battered the head of Mr. Johnson, who
lodged in the house of the Stones. He
declares that she ambushed him and
committed the assault as he was en

fully accused him of throwing filth into

Diercks, just as resolutely maintained
that it was a case of assault, they
being recipients of the battery and
Louis Hessler its sole administrator.
What appeared like aggression on their
part, Messrs. Rust and Diercks eluci
dated, was really their efforts to es
cape trie left leads, right swings and
ambidexterous uppercuts directed at
them by Mr. llessler, who was sudh a
shrewd boxer, his footwork especially
being little short of marvelous, that his
onset afforded them no opportunity to
do anything else than elude his light
ning-like rushes and ward off his
blows. If that was regarded aa a real
fight by Judge Mogan, whom they re
spected as an admirer of the fistic
game, then they were willing to take
whatever punishment he might pre-
scribe. But their esteem for his knowl
edge of the art manly would undergo
depreciation.
â  It was in a Clay-street saloon fre
quented by bakers that the three de
fendants, members of the bread-mak
ing craft, were arrested. Mr. Hessler's
ire, it was explained, originated in the
disputing of his opinion on a question
I relating to their common trade by
Mr. Rust and Mr. Diercks, both of
whom sought to mollify his wrath by
telling him that they could not and.
would not fight, which information,
strange to say, only made him the more
eager*to engage them in combat. The
more determinedly they declared for
peace the more vociferously did he de
mand warfare, and their final refusal
to accede to his demand was instantly
followed by the onslaught afore de
scribed.
The Judge fined Mr. Hessler $5 and
discharged Messrs. Rust and Diercks,
lat the same time informing them that
! from a sportsman's viewpoint they
would have been more deserving
1 of dismissal if they had accommodated
Mr. Hessler by fighting him.

James Baxter, charged with drunk
enness, said he was an owner of race
I horses that could not run In the mud
and that pending the return of dry
weather and fast tracks he had im
bibed more than was good for him, but
would instantly return to Emeryville If
Judge Fritz would let him go. Judge
Fritz did let him go, and then Bailiff
Conlon recognized in him a chronic
beggar and inebriate who had been in
court many times before, whereupon
the Judge regretted that he had not
known that fact ere the dismissal was
Ordered.
\ "No reason for regret," quoth the
bailiff, and then he offered to wager
even money that within a week from
date Mr. Baxterâwhose proper name is
Clarkâwould again be drunk and in
police custody. No takers.

Want New Bridge Built.
The Mount Vernon Improvement
Club petitioned the Supervisors yester
day to authorize the City Engineer to
make plans and an estimate of cost
for the building of a bridge to replace
the one now at Mount Vernon and San
Jose avenues over the tracks of the
Southern Pacific Company. The peti
tioners assert that the old bridge and
its approaches are in a dangerous con
dition. The City Engineer has recom
mended the building of a new bridge
and the club says it will ask later that
an appropriation be made in the bud
j get to build the bridge.
