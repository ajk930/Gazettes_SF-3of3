GRAND JURY IS TRACING ALLEGED CONSPIRACY
According to evidence now in the hands of the Grand Jury, large amounts of the city's money alleged to have been stolen by Edward J. Smith last year were used in private
investments. Foreman Andrews is investigating the story of the shortage of $16>,000. Facts in his possession show that Smith could not have squandered that sum. The profits
made by grafters in the License Office am estimated at over $300,000. Several municipal employes who are implicated with Smith will be indicted to-day.

The crimes of Edward J. Smith con
stitute a municipal scandal of small de
gree compared with what will be re
voaled If the evidence now in the hands
of Foreman Andrews of the Grand
Jury is worked out to a conclusion.
He expects to uncover an astounding
state of affairs in which the city's
mon*-*. has been used and manipulated
tiy pmTaT<e"""iiMlivttTTaJs -tor" private In
vestments and that Tax Collector Smith
was only one of a gang of conspirators.
According to Expert Douglas Young's
figures the graft in the license office
h*is be-?n far in excess of $300,000. He
turned in a report to the Finance Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors last
December, giving figures to show that
the license office should â be - gathering
$M)0.OOU more than the books showed.
Why it did not and where the money
â¢went is a matter that the Grand Jury
will now sift tt_f the bottom.
It If certain that several municipal
employes implicated with Smith â¢ in
tentionally, or through carelessness,
vill be indicted to-day.
When the examination of the tax
*nVe, begun yesterday, is finished, a
fu!l meeting of the Grand Jury will
be called. That will mean that sev
rral men connected with the Tax Col
lector's office and possibly two or three
in the Treasurer's office will be in
volved in charges <A conspiracy.
District Attorney Byington and
Foreman Andrews held a consultation
with .Captain Burnett yesterday and
asked his assistance to see that the
men upon whom a cloud rests should
jiot leave t<>v. i The men to be in
dicted are now under surveillance.
Among the facts that developed yes
terday was 1' â â¢t many clerks Â»n mu
nicipal offices are under insufficient
bond^s or no b*nds at all. Louis A.
*Devoto, who cashed Smith's personal
check' for $15,250, is under bond for only
$10,000. One of the first recommenda
tions that will be made by the Grand
Jury is that the city's money should
be better protected i) this regard.
Mr*. James B. Smith lies dangerously
111 at her home on Fair Oaks street.
Slie had been sick before the news of
h'M husband's perfidy. The shock of
the disgrace brought upon her by the
man she loved has made her condition
' critical. At a late hour no change for
the better was reported.
The counting of the money in the
Joint contingent fund was completed (
yesterday. The money was all there
with the exception of the $15,290 given
to the defaulting Tax Collector by
Louis A. Devoto.
â¢ Foreman Andrews has ordered a
watch put over the safe where the
Tax Collector's records are kept.
He was warned to do this. An inci
dent that occurred during the O'Brien
regime was the cause of this precau
tion. During the Investigation of a
shortage at that time certain import
ant records disappeared. James Mc-
Cabe, who is now temporarily in
charge of the tax office, was at that ;
time a trusted clerk of O'Brien's.
Foreman Andrews Is still skeptic re- '
garding the story of Smith's alleged '
shortage of $165,000 of a year ago. John
It. Smith maintains stoutly that such |
a shortage did exist and that It was ;
erovpred by hi? brother. James B.
gmith. He -lares that several per- \
rons connected with the Treasurer's of
fice could corroborate this if they
wanted to.
The brothers of the defaulter will be
maaÂ« to furnish complete proof of this
story to the Grand Jury. In the course
of the investigation they will be made
to tell what securities were given to
rais* the money.
Foreman Andrews and Juryman
will resume the investigation 1
Â»t 9 o'clock to-day. The Grand Jury'
vill meet at 2 o'clock. * j

Andrews Says Bombshell Is Ready to Explode
and Smith's Accomplices Cannot Escape.
As a result of the Grand Jury In
vestigation, it is probable that others
than Edward J. Smith will be impli
cated in the stealing of public funds.
Behind the shortage of $165,000 is
the story of a startling conspiracy.
Foreman Andrews is in possession of
Information that tends to show that the
city's tax money was used in private
enterprises. Andrews, however, re
fuses to give details of the manner in
| which the funds were used.
"I can say nothing now," he de
clared, "but a bombshell Is almost
', ready to explode."
Particular attention has been given
' to investigating the license office. The
' graft unearthed in this department is
j said by Expert Young to be enormous,
: reaching over $300,000. The Jury will
! probably find at least one indictment
in that office to-day.

was appointed to succeed Smith, i 3
under rigid investigation. Foreman
Andrews did not. have him on the
grill yesterday, as such action, might
destroy the chance , of, indicting him.

necessary.
Foreman Andrews and Juror Bund

and Expert Young will straighten out

EMPLOYES ARE QUESTIONED.

ten." wan Andrews' comment while
taking a breathing spell.
There were men on the payroll who
did no work and Smith made dummy
demands upon the treasury for em
ployes who did not exist. This petty
graft ran into the thousands.
Regarding the real working force of
clerks, however, Foreman Andrews
found no fault. While the office car
ried a number of "employes" who did
nothing for their salaries, the others
accomplished as much work as the
clerks of any other municipal office
Recalling an incident of the, O'Brien
regime, when some records that con
tained damaging evidence were burned,
Foreman Andrews placed a guard over
the safe where the records of Trx Col
lector Smith are kept. When O'Brien
was under suspicion, books containing
evidence that might have convicted
him. disappeared.
James McCabe was one of O'Brien's
trusted clerks and it was charged that
he destroyed them. Foreman Andrews
was told of this incident and w*ll take
no chances.
Handwriting Expert Theodore Kytka.
who has been working for three weeks
gathering evidence in Smith's system
of making dummy demands upon the
treasury, was called by Foreman An
drews. His evidence is complete and
wil! be presented to the Grand Jury
at the meeting to-day. It is reported
that employes of the Treasurer's office
are implicated in this graft.
KYTKA GETS EXEMPLAR.
Kytka aÂ«ked for a good exemplar of
Edward J. Smith's handwriting and
was shown the personal check which
the defaulter cashed at the Treasurer's
office. This was identified by. McCabe
as a perfect sample of Smith's writing.
Supervisor Brandenstein was an
other of the witnesses summoned by
the Grand Jury. He find District At
torney Byington consulted over the
loss sustained by the Treasurer's de
partment and agreed that it would
amount to about $30,000. For this loss
Treasurer McDougald and Chief Dep
uty Louis A. Devoto are to be held
personally responsible. Devoto's bond,
according to Frank L. Gilbert, who
represents the National Surety Com
pany, is only for $10,000.
While investigating along those lines
Foreman Andrews discovered that
bonds for clerks and deputies in both
the Tax Collector's office and the
Treasurer's office were ridiculously in
sufficient. The city's funds, he de
clared, were almost without protection
in this regard.
In the evening Foreman Andrews
and District Attorney Byingrton held a
secret consultation with Captain Bur
nett. In view of the fact that several
indictments will be found to-day they
asked the captain to makf> sure that
the people wanted do not leave town.
The men who will be indicted are now
being carefully watched by detectives.
John R. Smith, brother of the de
faulter, hung around the Tax Collec
tor's office all day. He held frequent
whispered consultations with McCabe.
Young Smith's nervousness increased
as the investigation proceeded.
He reasserted that there had been
a shortage of $165,000, and that it had
been made good by his brother, James
B. Smith. He declared that there
were people In the Treasurer's office
who could prove that the shortage ex
isted and that the money had been re
stored.
Foreman Andrews will Insist upon
absolute proof of this. Where and
how James R. Smith got the money
must be shown. The Grand Jury will
demand to know what securities were
pledged to raise the sum. In fact, the
minutest details of the transaction
must be shown.
Among the other witnesses exam
ined were Deputy Treasurer A. W.
Hebro and W. Cole of the license of
fice. Foreman Andrews asked the
Chief of Police for assistance, and De
tectives Tom Gibson. Ross Whittaker
and Harry Reynolds were detailed to
help him.

WASHINGTON. April 28.â President
Roosevelt is directing, by telegraph
from his hunting camp in Colorado.
an investigation of the grave charges
preferred by Bowen. Minister to Vene
zuela, against the official inteitrltv of
his superior officer Loomis, First As
sistant Secretary of State. Secretary
Taft submits aH deiylapnwnts of-thÂ«
case to the President and acts only
upon his instruction.
Orders for Bowen to proceed home
immediately will undoubtedly be
issued to-morrow and it is ex
pected that he will be here by
May 10. If, when he has left Cara
cas. Venezuela does not become more
friendly in the matter of the asphalt
controversy, a climax will lÂ»e reached
in the relations between the two Gov
ernments.
Throughout Washington interest in
the investigation is sustained at a hich
pitch. It is generally realized that it is
now in order for Loomis and Bowen to
fight it out. with the President as an
Impartial judge. In the highest official
quarters it is frankly stated that the
way Is clear for the termination of an
impossible situation.
Minister Bowen. weeks aaro. while
Secretary Hay was still in Washing
ton, cabled from Caracas that it was
reported in the clubs and on the streets
that President Castro held a check for
$10,000 made out to Loomis by the
Asphalt Company. This drew from
Secretary Hay a rebuke to Bowen.
There is official authority for the
statement that Hay informed Bowen
he should not have reported the gossip
and that he should not have sent it by
cable. Secretary Hay before doing this
conveyed Bowen s dispatch to Presi
dent Roosevelt.
SAYS IT'LL PROOFS EXIST.
President Roosevelt investigated the
charge about the check, satisfied him
self it was not well founded and left
Washington without any further ac
tion in the case. He had not been
absent long when he received from
Bowen, of whom Taft was for four
years a classmate at Yale, the further
charges.
Of these Bowen declared there was
documentary proof. He did not pro
duce the full proofs which he said ex
isted. The charges were made by
Bowen in a personal letter to Taft. but
Taft decided he could not consider
these charges personallly, as he was the
acting head of the State Department,
but that they must be officially investi
gated.
It Is ouite certain that Bowen will
not return to Caracas as American
Minister, except perhaps, to present his
letters of recall, for tt Is understood
that, even If his explanation Is satis
factory and he Is to remain In the dip
lomatic service, his usefulness in Car
acas will have been Impaired and It
will be necessary to carry out the
State Department's original plan,
formed before the publication of the
attack upon Loomis. and transfer Bow
en to either Colombia or Chile, or per
haps to Brazil in the event that Em
bassador Thompson is sent to Mexico,
as he desires. /
NOT ON FRIENDLY TERMS.
Much Interest centers in the origin
of the feud between Bowen and Loo
mis. When Loomis was Minister to
Venezuela, Bowen was Minister to
Persia. On his way to the United
States to take his new post, Bowen
stopped in Paris. Loomis at that
time was in Switzerland, preparatory
to taking hte new post at Lisbon, and
is said to have been displeased by an
interview given by Bowen saying the
United States would enjoy good rela
tions with Venezuela; that all that was
needed at Caracas was a man of dis
cretion. Two years ago. when the al
lied powers, England. Germany and
Italy, undertook the blockade of the
Venezuelan coast to force the pay
ment of their claims against that coun
try. Minister Bowen was high in Cas
tro's favor. He was commissioned by
President Castro, with the permission
of the United States, to come to Wash
ington, representing Venezuela for the
I purpose of treating with the powers.
About the same time Loomis, home
on a leave from Lisbon, was given
the post of Assistant Secretary of
State. Loomis and Bowen met here for
the first time in the course of the ne

Well-Known Soldier a
Victim of Stroke of
Apoplexy.
WASHINGTON. April :?.â Brigadier
General Fitzhugh Lee. L". d. A., retired,
died at Providence Hospital here to
night, aged 6Â» years, from an attack
of apoplexy which he suffered early
this morning on a train while en routu
from Boston to Washington. After
General Lee had been removed to tho
hospital this morning it was evidenc
to the attending physicians thai
case was a very serious one. but
believed that his strong vitality and
will power would assist materially m
a partial recovery at least from the
attack. Hid condition remained fair,
considering the severity of the at
tack, during the day. but shortly after
9 o'clock to-night he began to grow
weaker, his breathing became more
rapid and his pulse lower, terminating
in lesa than two hours In death. Tha
end was peaceful and without pa;;i,
the general remaining conscious until
within five minutes of the end. Half
an hour before death General Lee rec
ognized his brother. Daniel Lee. who
came into the room for a moment.
In the room when he died were Dr.
Montgomery, one of the physicians at
the hospital; Miss Doraey, a relative,
and a nurse, two of the attending phy
sicians. Drs. Edie and Kean, having
retirei temporarily. A pathetic fea
ture of the caae is that, although Gen
eral Lee was blessed with a family
consisting of a wife and five children,
no-t one of them was with him at tho
time of his death.
General Lee was conscious through
out the day and recognized those who
were admitted to the sick room. Neces
sarily tht were very few persons and
included the attending physicians, the
nurses and several relatives who came
to visit him. While not suffering any
pain, the general was rather uncom
fortable most of the time, his breath
ing being difficult and his articu.
when he attempted to speak bates
heavy and thick.
The orders of Lieutenant George Lee,
a son, wh>Â» is in San Francisco on his
way to the Philippines, have been
changed, and he will come to Wash

companied by his sifter, the wife of
Lieutenant Brown, who also is now on
the Pacific Coaat and whose orders
were issued directing him to sail wit^

General Lees attack is attributed
largely to his activity in behalf of the

COUPLE AT STATION
Railroad Employes Certain
That Collector and Leona
Brooks Were Passengers
on Southbound Express
The Southern Pacific officials are
lending every possible aid to the de
tectives in the effort to apprehend the
fugitive Tax Collector. Yesterday the
employes at the railroad depot at Third
and Townsend streets and the crew of
the Sunset express that left here on
the evening of April 20 were called
upon for statements and these fully
confirmed the report published in yes
terday's Call to the effect that Smith
and a woman, commonly known' in the
tenderloin district as Leona Brooks,
were passengers on the south-bound
express on the night mentioned.
According to the statements of sev
eral employes at the depot Smith and
his female companion arrived at the
depot in an automobile five minutes
before the train left and immediately
proceeded to the car in which their
drawing-room was located. They car
ried hand satchelÃ with them and were
met just inside the depot shed by a
colored man who had preceded them
at least ten minutes with two grips.
Smith had evidently had a friend in
the railroad office procure tickets for
him. He did not buy them at the main
office on Market street and the ticket
agent at Third and Townsend streets
says the fleeing couple did not stop at
his window.
DID NOT LEAVE TRAIN.
Shortly after getting aboard the car
Smith reappeared a moment on the
piatform and asked where his colored
ntan had gone, but failing to see him
Ia returned to the drawing-room.
When the train agent passed through
the car Smith was not in evidence in
the drawing-room, but the woman pre
sented the tickets.
It j\as reported early yesterday that
Fmith had left the drawing-room just
before reaching Gilroy, and for a time
it was supposed that he might have
got off the train at that station with
a view of eluding his persuers, but
Conductor Hunkins is positive that thY
occupant? of all the care went through
as far as San Luis Â©bispo. where the
run of the train crew from this city
ends.
Smith had made frequent trips dur
ing the le.st few months to Los An
geles in company with a well-known
politician, and is reported to have
plursed heavily on the races in the
south, ffts operations on the track
there had caused considerable com
ment, but no one ever suggested the
possibility of his having used funds
other than his own to make his bets.
He spent money liberally around Los
Angeles at night, and this fact caused
some of hi? acquaintances there to sus
pect that he was preparing the way for
seme political nomination In the fu
ture by getting acquainted with the
"push."
BUYS WOMAN A XECKLACE.
It was common talk in Los Angeles
that Smith was showing a deep At
tachment for lÂ«eona Brooks, and no
surprise was expressed by-, her friends
when they learned that she had been
furnished money and transportation to
return to IMb city, where, it has since
been shown, she was still the^pbject of
Smith's attentions.
The fact became known yesterday
that before leaving San Franftisco
Smith purchased from a Market-street
jewelry firm a magnificent necklace for
Leona Brooks, who had, in the mean
time, been making extravagant pur
chases of dresses and other articles of
clothing, presumably at the expense of
her peculating admirer. The local
friends of Leona Brooks, among them
Alma Rueeell, who was the confidante
of Leona while they were inmates of
a house on Ellis street, declare that
the woman had no suspicion that
Smith was spending the money of the
city, but supposed that he had made
several big winnings on the race
track.

BROTHER COMES TWICE
TO TAXMAN'S RESCUE
Money Paid After Discovery
in the Records That Ac
counts With tyie Treasurer
Were in a Bad State
John R. Smith, 'the brother of ex-
Tax Collector Smith, indignantly de
nied yesterday the intimations given
out that the story of the big shortage
of $165,000 which was made up last
year by James B. Smith, another
brother, Js a myth. Acting Tax Col
lector James W. McCabe lends some
color to the theory, however, that
there was no shortage and that the
Tax Collector merely bilked his
brother, for the former deputy's rec
ords show that all taxes were ao*
counted for by the payment of coin,
with the exception of those delin
quent. â¢ â¢
John. Smith declares that McCabe
was not in a position to know that
there was a shortage. Smith says that
the money was paid by his brother
James, who raised it among friends,
and that all McCabe had to do in the
matter was to credit the moneys
turned into the city treasury for the
taxec When the time came for the
settlement to be made with the Treas
urer the money was produced.
Another reason advanced why there
could not have been such a big short
age is that the records of the Treas
urer's office show only one receipt or
deposit tag for the $84,000 alleged to
have been paid to satisfy the balance
due on the shortage, while there is
no receipt for the balance of the
money. The entire transaction is ex
plained by John Smith as follows:
My brother Edward's Idea In April. ISO*,
was that he was $01,000 short. He had de
posited checks in various banks to hla own
account and drawn money out against the
checks to euit his convenience. When the
time came for a settlement to be made with
the City Treasurer he floured up that he had
but $17,000 -In each, leaving $81,000 to be made
good. James gave him $2000 at once toward
the shortage, which left the amount $79,000.
BROTHER TO THE RESCUE.
When he went to James and confessed the
latter agreed to help him out and drew $13,000
of his private moneys out of bank. He then
made a check for the amount payable to Ed
ward J. Smith. Then James went to friends
who advanced him $C6;000 on security, and he
made out another check for the last amount.
ICdward took the two checks to his bank, where
he Dlaced them on deposit. He drew one
check for $79,000 on the bank and the cash
was delivered to the City Treasurer in my
iiresenca.
We were congratulating ourselves that
everything was settled when George Varcoe,
accountant In the tax office, came to us and
said that he had made a clerical error In
creditinr the Tax Collector with the sum of
$84,000 by making a duplicate entry in the
cash ledger. The amount had been entered on
one day and through some mistake had been
again entered on the next day. We were
dumfounded, as it meant that there was still
$84,000 to account for.
"My God," said Edward, "I have no such
amount of money. What shall I do?"
Then James came to the rescue again. Bar
ing: "I will see you through this."
James secured an additional $84,000 from
friends and made out a certified check pay
able to E. J. Smith. The check waa deposited
in the latter' Â» Â«bank and he signed a new
check for the amount, payable to John E. Mc-
Dougald, City Treasurer, the check being there
upon deposited with the latter official. The
fact that a check was deposited with the
Treasurer was made the reason for an indi
vidual deposit tag, but the $79,000 paid in
cash previously was included in the total cash
deposits of that day. That is why there ap
pears to be no record of the payment of the
$79,000 in the Treasurer** office, nor of the
$2000 first advanced by James.
BIG SUM IN BANK.
On the other hand, it is claimed
that when the time for settlement
came on May 18, 1904, there was an
actual shortage of but $6000 or $8000.
On that day it is alleged between
$400,000 and $600,000 waa delivered to
the Treasurer's office that had been
on deposit in the American National
Bank for two or three months. The
money had been allowed to accumu
late by Edfvard Smith as the result
of cashing checks paid for taxes dur
ing that period. A significant circum
stance in connection with the matter
is that James B. Smith is a director in
the bank named. The money properly
belonged in the city treasury, as under
the law all moneys paid for taxes
shall be deposited In the treasury
within twenty-four hours after col
lection.
An Impression has gone forth that
the clerks and deputies in the tax of
fice are mixed up In the misdoings of
Tax Collector Smith. Such is far from
being the case. Had they not been
faithful it would have been possible
for them to Join in the irregularities
in the office without any fear of per
sonal detection. The clerks have rea
son to think harshly of Smith, as he
so manipulated the expenditures for
extra clerk hire that they lost their
salaries for one month last year and
had to sue the city to obtain their
salaries for another month.

More Delinquents
Hold Receipts
for Taxes.
_ii â â¦
Investigation Is by
No Means
Ended.
The known shortage of defaulting
Tax Collector Edward J. Smith was
increased by over $5000 yesterday.
Discovery was made that two prop
erty owners whose taxes were not
marked paid on the records held re
ceipts from Smith for the amounts.
The additional moneys appropriat- j
ed by Smith are $1292, representing j
the taxes of the Protestant Orphan â 
Asylum, and $45Â»6 24. the taxes paid
by Isaac Kohn. Two pieces of church
property standing in the name of
Archbishop Riordan are marked de
linquent for taxes aggregating $500 97,
but Expert Thomas E. Atkinson has
been unable as yet to ascertain if
payment was made. He has a list of
other large sums standing delinquent
and will prosecute a diligent inquiry
to ascertain if they were actually paid. .
If they were, the peculations of Smith
will be still further increased.
Smith used a stamp to receipt the
tax bills for which he received the
cash. The stamp had not been used
in the office for some time! It was
known as "stamp No. 8" and was dis
carded when a new stamp was ob
tained. "No. 8" was not destroyed*
however, and Smith took the stamp
away from the office and stamped the
bills at his leisure, afterward collect
ing the amounts the bills called for.
The taxpayers saw nothing. Irregular in
the proceeding, aa Smith invariably
signed the stamp with his initial "S."
LJST OF DELINQUENTS.
Acting Tax Collector McCabe has
made up a list of ail delinquencies in
excess of $100 and an attempt will be
made to ascertain if the persons
standing delinquent have paid their
taxes in order to straighten out the
roll. All those who can produce re
ceipted bills will be fully protected, aa
the money appropriated by Smith will
have to be made good by his bonds
men.
Considerable comment was heard
yesterday as to why Chief Deputy
Treasurer Devoto had not immediate
ly presented Smith's personal check
for $15,590 08, which Devoto cashed
Thursday of last week, to the Crocker-
Woolworth Bank. Had Devoto done
so and learned that there were no
funds to Smith's credit he could have
reported the matter to the proper au
thorities and Smith might have been
apprehended. As Devoto did not
make known the check incident until
the day of Smith's exposure as a de
faulter Devoto's delay gave Smith a
start of six days. Aside from the con
tention that Devoto had no rieht to
cash the personal check of Smith or
any one else, the point is raised that
Devoto should have cashed .the check
before the close of the day's business.
SMITH GETS TWO HATS.
The spirit of appropriating things
stuck to Smith almost up to the last
moment before he left the city on his
southern trip. He stepped into Korn'a
hat store on Market street and
asked for a Panama hat. Korri did
not have one to suit his customer, so
he went Â»ut and got a $30 hat. Smith
took the hat, put it In his grip and
left the place, telling Korn to charge
it. Smith then went down to Tom
Dillon's place and got another Pana
ma hat, which he also had charged.
The count of the sacks of gold In
the joint custody Bafe in the City
Treasurer's office â was concluded yes
terday afternoon and the amount of
$5,940,000 was 'duly checked. To-day,
the city officials and members of the
Gfand Jury will begin the counting of
the coin in the main vault. This
amounts to between $2,000,000 and
$3,000,000 and the task will take all
day. It will then be known if the
funds In the Treasurer's office are in
tact.
Two new candidates are in the field
for the vacancy caused by the remov
al of Smith. Ex-Supervisor Horace
Wilson and Dan O'Callaghan are will
ing: to serve the city as Tax Collector
if the Mayor is willlngr. His Honor
said that he may not announce the
appointment until next Monday, al
though he may make up his mind to
day.

BAD TIDINGS

SMITH'S WIFE
Defaulter's Invalid.
Spouse Takes
Blow Hard
Mrs. Edward J. Smith, wife of the
defaulting Tax Collector, was so se
verely shocked at the sad news of her
husband's wrongdoings that much fear
I was for a while felt for her recovery.
However, she rallied yesterday. Last
night the doctors said she was on the
road to recovery and that all she
needed to restore her to health was
rest.
Mrs. Smith has been ill for a long
time. Several weeks ago she was con
fined to her bed and ever since that
time she has been under the care of a
doctor and a trained nurse. When she
heard of her husband's flight the
shock affected her to an alarming ex
tent. She suffers from fainting spells
and nervous breakdowns.

SUPREME COURT HOLDS THAT
BOODLING SENATORS MAY VOTE
Can Be Deprived of Franchise Rights
Only Upon Conviction by Su
perior Court.
The Supreme Court yesterday hand
ed down its opinion in the appeal of
former Senators French, Wright, Em
mons and Bunkers for a writ of man
date to compel the Senate to reinstate
the expelled boodlers. The decision of
the court is that the Supreme Court
has no authority to interfere with the
action of the Legislature. A feature
of the decision is that the four bood
lers still have the privilege of voting.
That can only be taken from them
when a conviction is obtained in the
Superior Court.
Another point Is yiat as the Thirty
sixth session is a thing of the past, the
usurpation of the legislative function
of reinstatement would be impossible.
The next regular session of the Senate
will be composed of different legisla
tors and will be an entirely different
body.
The petition alleged that the Sena
tors were discharged without notice,
but this the Supreme Court holds to
be untrue, as charges were preferred
against the petitioners and referred to
a committee for investigation, which
committee subsequently reported that
the charges were true and recommend
ed expulsion. There was no irregular
ity in the proceedings, as the Senate
has power to proceed with its business
any way it may select.
The opinion follows the denial of
the writ on April .3, when George D.
Collins appeared for the four petition
ers and Attorney General Webb for
the people at the request of the Legis
lature.

She was then permitted to proceed.
The captain of the Hansa reports
that the colliers and other supply ships

since his departure from Kamranh Bay,
Saturday, the Russian admiral has

When sighted by the Hansa he was

rROSPECTS FOR PEACE.
Negotiations Are in Progress, but Fact
Is Beinc Kept Secret.
WASHINGTON, April 28.â President
Roosevelt's sudden decision to shorten
his bear hunt and return to Washing
ton is due to a suggestion from Sec
retary Taft that several important
questions demand his attention at
once. Among these are the peace ne
gotiations, which have taken such a
turn as to require his presence. It is
known positively that peace negotia
tions have been in progress since the
President left, but the State Depart
ment is taking great care pending his
return to keep the facts from the pub
lic.
Expecting that Washington is des
tined to play an important part in the
preliminary negotiations that will pre
cede the cessation of hostilities be
tween Russia and Japan, even though
th American capital may not be se
lected as the scene for the actual peace
n'-sr. .nations. Baron Sternburg. the Ger
man Embassador, ami M. Jusserand,
the French Embassador, will sail for
their respective countries soon after
conferring; with President Roosevelt
when he returns from the West. Baron
Sternburg will have several audiences
with the Emperor and M. Jusserand
will se<* President Loubet and M. Del
casse, to whom will be communicated
in an entirely unofficial way the ear
nebt wish of the President that the war
be ended at the earliest possible mo
ment. The Embassadors will supple
ment their dispatches by personal tes
timony of the activities at Washing
ton in this direction, which have been
led by the President.
Sir Mortimer Durand, the British
Err.bassador, who sails to-morrow on
the Etruria for London, is in full pos
pf^ssion at President Roosevelt's views,
which he will communicate in an in
formal way to King Edward. So far
as their Embassadors at Washington
can judge. King Edward and Emperor
William are as anxious as President
Roosevelt for an early ending of the
war. As the ally of one of the belliger
ents. Great Britain is prevented from
taking the friendly initiative open to
the President and Emperor William,
but the necessity of the King's co
operation as well as that of the French
Government is readily recognized.
Whatever the result of the naval bat
tle impending, diplomats at Washing
tun believe the first real opportunity

FITZHUGH LEE'S CAREER.
Renowned Alike in Works of Peace
and of War.
Fitzhugh Lee was a nephew of Gen
eral Robert E. Lee and the grandson
of General Henry Lee, the noted
"Light Horse Harry" of th<^ Revolu
tionaiy War. It was this s^me "Light
Horse Harry" who first gave voice to
the ever-living Washingtonian eulogy:
"First in war, first in peace and first in
the hearts of his countrymen:"
General Fitzhugh Lee was born on
November 19, 1835, in Clermont, Fair
fax County, Va. Inspired, doubtless,
by the traditions of his family, his
youthful ambition was to become a
soldier. . After obtaining a rudiment
ary education in local schools, he en
tered the West Point Military Acad
emy, where he speedily developed the
(sterling and popular traits which
marked his conduct in all phases of
life. He was a favorite among his
classmates and a noted athlete, lead
ing his class in expert horsemanship.
He waa graduated from West Point in
1856 and was commissioned second
lieutenant in the Second Cavalry.
Within a year he was permitted to
Join his regiment in the Southwest,
where he engaged in some spirited
combats with the Indians. In one of
these fights he was severely wounded,
an Indian arrow having: lodged in his
side.
While acting as an Instructor in the
military academy the Civil Wax broke
I
out, and young 1-ee offered his services
to the Confederacy. On the 25th of
July. 1862, 1^- was made a brigadier
jreneral, and about a year later he
became a major general. He was a
conspicuous figure in the battle of
Winchestei\ on which occasion three
horses were shot under him and he
was severely wounded.
After several months spent in the
hospital he returned to the field, and
In March. lS6r., he was placed in com
mand of the entire cavalry corps of the
Army of Northern Virginia. l,ee dis
played skill as well as courage as a
cavalry leader.
At Farmville, near Appomattox, he
led a brilliant charge, which drove
back General Crook's cavalry division,
and held the key to the situation until
Sheridan and Ord arrived with Fed
eral reinforcements and put an end to
the struggle. On the following day
General Robert E. Lee and General
Grant settled the terms of the sur
render of the Confederate forces.
One of the first of the recognized
leaders of the Confederacy to preach
the doctrine, "The war is over, let by
gones be bygones," was Fitzhugh Lee.
In the winter and spring of 1882-3
he made, a tour of investigation
through the Southern States in the in
terest of the Southern Historical So
ciety. About the same time he at
tended a reunion of Confederate vet
erans and aroused much enthusiasm
by reminding his hearers that the blue
and the gray were reunited In lo.al
allegiance to one flag and one country.
General Lee was elected Governor
of Virginia in 1885. A mutual regard
sprang up between President Cleve
land and General Lee, which ripened
into a strong friendship. When in
April, 1886. it became necessary to
have a strong, fearless, cool-headed
and discreet representative of this
Government in Havana, President
Cleveland sent for Fitzhugh Lee and
induced him to accept the place. Un
der the peculiar and exacting responsi
bilities of his office Consul General
Lee displayed great diplomatic ca
pacity.
General Lee was retained as Consul
General to Havana by President Jk-
Kinley because the President and his
Cabinet convinced themselves that un
der the circumstances they could not
get as well equipped a man to take his
place.
When the Spanish-American war
broke out General Lee took the field
and was placed in command of the
Seventh Army Corps.
In April. 1901. General Le e spent
a brief peViod in San Francisco for his
health.

ST. PETERSBURG, April 28.â Three ,
days' hard fasting preceding Easter,' 1
accompanied by solemn services, began
to-day. Business of every character '
ceased and all the Government depart
ments were closed. The alarming re
ports circulated during the last few !
days apparently had little effect on the :
size of the crowds that thronged the
churches, where the tragedy of Calvary ,
was vividly re-enaetetl. The day waa
also marked by the observance of the '
traditional ceremonies of freeing birds/i
lighting bonfires and placing holy t
bread in bins, but the bright sunshine j
did not fail to make a deep impression
upon the superstitious in the midst of
the gloomy forebodings of evil, being
augury of drought and crop failure, !
which in Russia is synonymous with
famine and disaster.
The diplomatic corps, including Em
bassador Meyer, attended the services
at St. Isaacs Cathedral. Every mem
ber of the Orthodox church took com
munion to-day, the Emperor and the
imperial family attending the service
and taking the sacrament at the chapel
of the Alexandra Palace at Tsarekoe-
Selo.

"Nan" Patterson's Lawyers
Rest on Contention That
( hargo Was Not Sustained
PROSECUTION FINISHES
Mrs. J. Morgan Smith Re
fuses to Answer Questions
Put by the state's Attorney
NEW YORK, April 28.â After a day !
of interesting developments both* the
prosecution and the defense rested in
the case of Nan Patterson, indicted
for the murder of Caesar Young, the
wealthy bookmaker, almost a year
ago. The prosecution finished its case
Just before the adjournment of the
court and later Attorney O'Reilly of
counsel for Miss Patterson notified
the prosecution that his side would
submit no defense and would rest on
the contention that the State had
failed to make any case against the
defendant.
The plan had been under consider
ation for some days, but was only de
cided upon at a conference to-day be
tween the counsel for Nan Patterson
and her aged father. The decision
meuns the speedy conclusion of the
woman's third trial for the sensational
tragedy on West Broadway. When
the case is called on Monday. to
which date the trial was adjourned
to-day. Assistant District Attorney
Rand will Immediately beg-in the
summing up of the case of the State.
Besides this, the succession of
events which marked to-day proceed
ing? included the court's denial of a
motion to dismiss the indictment; the
testimony of the prisoner's sister. Mrs.
J. Morgan Smith, in which she made
pome interesting statements, but stood
on her right to refuse to answer ques
tions, on the ground that the answers
might incriminate her; Rand's prom
ise to quash the conspiracy indict
ments against Mrs. Smith if she would
answer his questions, and the protest
of the counsel of the defense to the
court that Rand's merciless method of
questioning was "badgering the wit
ness " and the rejection again by the
court of the much quoted letter of
Mrs. Smith to Young expressing fear
as to the consequences if Young did
not see her sister.
MRS. SMITH OX STAND.
In the course of his examination
Rand asked Mrs. Smith if she pos
sessed all the information she has tes
tified to in this trial at the time she
left New York last June. Mrs. Smith
replied that she would like to answer
the question, but feared it would tend
to degrade and incriminate her, as she
if= under indictment for conspiracy.
The prosecutor then promised that if
she would answer he would move next
Monday to quash the indictment
against her, but she declined to do so.
The direct examination of Mrs.
Smith, which was not completed yes
terday, was resumed to-day. Mrs.
Smith testified yesterday that Miss
Patterson had expected Caesar Young
to get a divorce from his wife and
marry her. She, herself, believed that
Young intended eventually to marry
her sister until last May, when Leslie ,
Coggins told her that Young did not j
Intend to carry out the agreement. |
Miss Patterson became greatly excited .
when Coggins' statement was repeated
to her, Mrs. Smith said.
"Did not Coggins tell you that the
best thing Young thought Nan could
do was to accept Matt Trimble's offer
of marriage?" asked Rand.
"He did not say anything like that
to me," replied Mrs. Smith.
"Did Miss Patterson say that the
cause of her emotion was that Cog
gins had misrepresented Young's in
tentions toward her?"
"She did not say so in those words,
but I knew it."
"She did not tell you what she was
going to do?"
"No."
"And yet you described her as
'frantic' and 'desperate'?"
"Yes."
"When you wrote the letter to
Young were you In a state of feeling !
brought on by what Nan had told
you?"
"Yes, my sister is not responsible for
that letter."
"Did that letter represent truthfully
the state of your mind?"
"It did."
"Did it represent Nan's state of :
mind?"
This Question was not answered.
Rand here offered the intercepted
letter which Mrs. Smith sent to Young,
which was ruled out yesterday, and
again It was rejected by Recorder Goff.
IDENTIFIES A LETTER.
Mrs. Smith identified a letter which
ehe wrote to her sister, Harriet How
ell, of Washington. This letter was
written from Toronto and was said
by Rand to contain a statement to the
effect that Stern was there for the pur- j
pose of identifying them as the pur- i
chasers of the revolver and that they
Would have to go away. The name j
Stern, Rand claims, is represented by
the letter 8 and he attempted to get |
a confirmatory admission from the wit- ,
ness. She declined to answer when
the question was put to her, however,
and again Rand offered to dismiss the
conspiracy indictment If she would
reply.
Attorney Levy for the defense broke
In at this point with an objection to
the methods which were being em
ployed by the prosecutor. He com
plained to the Recorder that the wit
ness was being "badgered" and asked
that Rand be warned to proceed In a
different way. Rand replied that he
would not press for an answer as he
had no desire to confuse the witness.
DEFENDANT NEAR COLLAPSE.
The ordeal In the courtroom to-day
proved almost too much for "Nan"
Patterson. The resolute manner in
which Mrs. Smith refused to answer
questions put to her by the prosecuting
attorney and her declaration that she
would stand by her sister affected the
prisoner deeply and she was near a
breakdown when the luncheon adjourn
ment was announced. Mrs. Smith ap
peared to be unstrung as a result of
her experience and the two women
spent the recess In their cells in the
Tombs weeping In each other's arms.
The prosecution In the Patterson trial
rested its case this afternoon. The
clerk employed by Hyman Stern, the
pawnbroker, who. it was expected
would so on the stand to attempt to
identify Morgan Smith as the pur
chaser of the revolver with which
Young was killed, was not called by
the prosecution.
Just before the prosecution rested
i Rand read extracts from the testimony
: given hv Miss Patterson at the last
| trial, and then lecalled Mrs. Margaret
i Young, the dead bookmaker's widow.
â  Sh* was asked if she and her husband j
j had ever discussed a legal separation, !
but was not permitted to answer the '
question.

DRAWS INTO
THE STRIKE
Chicago Employers' Teaming
Association Carries the
Present Labor Troubles
Into United States Court
INJUNCTION ISSUED
AGAINST THE UNION
Non-Union Driver Uses His
Revolver When Attacked
by a Crowd and Seriously
Wounds Two Bystanders
CHICAGO, April 28.â For the first
time since the strike of the American
Railway Union the Government has
been made a'party to the labor troubles
in this city. The Government was
brought into the teamsters' strike to
day by the issuance of an injunction
by Judge C. C. Kohlsaat of the United
States Circuit Court The writ was
asked on behalf of the Employers' |
Teaming Association on the ground
that the organization iB incorporated
under the laws of West Virginia and is
therefore under the protection of the
Federal court. The order commandb
that all defendants refrain from any
interference with the business of the
Employers' Teaming Association and
commands the strikers to refrain from
picketing, massing on the streets, with
intent to interfere with the wagons of
the complainant and from interfering
in any manner with non-union men in
its employ.
As soon as Issued copies of the in
junction were printed on large cards
and two of these were attached to every
wagon of the Employers' Teaming As
sociation which went upon the streets
to-day. The Injunction exerted a !
pacifying influence and there was less
rioting in the streets than on yester
day.
A heavy thunderstorm which con
tinued during the latter part of the
afternoon and through the evening also
lent material assistance in keeping the
streets clear.
POLICE MAKE ARRESTS.
Twelve arrests were made for inter
ference with the injunction, all of them
being made at one time and place. At
1:30 o'clock this afternoon two waeons
loaded with coal approached the Union
League Club on Jackson Boulevard and
when they attempted to drive into the
narrow alley east of the clubhouse to
unload the non-union teamsters were
attacked by a crowd of strike sympa
thizers and a lively fight ensued. The
wagons were plainly marked with
copies of the injunction and the police
in charging the mob arrested twelve
strikers, who are now confined in the
Harrison Street Police Station. They
may be arraigned in the United States
Circuit Court to-morrow morniner.
One hundred and five copies of the
injunction were given to United
States Marshal Ames for service upon
the labor leaders, and five of his as
sistants were sent out immediately to
serve them. The greater part of the
notices had been given out by even-
Ing.
When news of the Injunction reached ;
President Shea of the Teamsters' |
Union, he iseued the following order,
signed by the committee of teamsters' i
business agents:
'To all union teamsters: Permit no
violation of the peace under any cir
cumstances. Competent drivers can
not be procured to handle the teams in
Chicago and violence will not help us
In this strike. Be loyal to your union
and obey its instructions."
The Injunction writ is made return
able May 10 and the defendants will be
given a hearing at 10 a. m. on that
day.
STRIKE SPREADS STEADILY.
In the afternoon a new situation
was placed before Judge Kohlsaat
when attorneys for the Scott Trans
fer Company asked for an order to re
strain the heads of the various unions
from calling out the men who are
working for the transfer company.
Kohlsaat declared that the injunc
tion prayed for was too sweeping in Its
scope and directed that a modified
form be presented to him to-morrow
morning.
The strike spread steadily through
out the day. Most of the teamsters
going out, however, were employed by
small concerns. There are now about
3500 teamsters on strike and their in
action has largely deprived about
15,000 other men of work.
It was impossible to-day to have a '
package delivered to any address
outside of the downtown dis
trict from any of the large
drygoods stores. Customers were told
that delivery of large parcels
could not be made for a day or two ;
at least and they were strongly urged
to take small packages with them.
Hundreds of people called in person
and by telephone at the headquarters
of the drygoods' drivers asking to have
parcels delivered. All of the requests
were refused. Express drivers, how
ever, were instructed by the strike
leaders to carry coffins and flowers to
funerals and in no manner to interfere
with the shipment of corpses.
SEVERAL PERSONS INJURED.
Three- persons were seriously Injured
during the street fighting to-day. They
are:
H. JL Brown, colored, non-onion
teamster, beaten Into unconsciousness.
Samuel Bradshaw, colored, non-union
teamster, struck on the head with a
piece of iron and knocked unconscious.
Budd Moore, a colored boy, sitting
on one of the wagons of Field & Co.,
was struck on the right arm with a
brick. The arm was broken Just above
the wrist.
Steady progress has been reported by
the Employers' Teaming Association In
securing men to take the places of the
strikers and it is predicted by the em
ployers that before many days they
will have their business back to a nor
mal basis.
Two men were shot and seriously
wounded to-night by Charles King, a
non-union driver for the Pacific Ex
press Company. King was on a Blue
Island -avenue car, when a crowd of
strikers who had followed him boarded
the car and attacked him. King drew
a revolver and emptied it at his as
sailants. He shot none of the men who
attacked him, but instead the bullets
struck two men who were standing
near watching the fight. Joseph Zeig
ler, one of the Injured men, received
a bullet In the left thigh, the bone be
ing shattered. His leg will have to be
amputated. Patrick Enright was shot
in the left arm and his injuries are not
fatal
King was arrested by the police after
a light, in which he attempted to shoot
the officers.

DENVER, April 28.â Mrs. Annie T
Newman of Los Angeles has come to
Denver to search for the mining prop
erty which her husband, who deserted
her ten years ago, owned at the time of
his death. Twelve years ago she mar
ried Thomaa R. Newman, son of James
Newman, a wealthy California mer
chant and fruit packer. Two years
later her husband, who offended his
parents by his marriage, left her and
returned to them. Reverses came and
her husband was left penniless. He
came to Colorado and located a mine
near Ward, Boulder County. Six
months ago he died in the county hos
pital here. Mrs. Newman believes the
mine may prove valuable. It was
named the "Annie N," in remembrance
of her.
Mrs. Newman says her husband re
ceived $50,000 from his father for de
serting her. She is stopping with
friends until she gathers some data
about the property, which had been de
veloped to some extent when her hus
band died. The mine is said to be near
the Utica property, one of the best
mines in the Ward district, and she
may realize something from it. She
says nothing else wos saved of the
property to which he was heir, and
that her father-in-law has nothing.
MILLIONAIRE'S FUTURE
BRIDE MAKES CIGARS
Rose Pastor Visits Factory Where
She Worked Before She
Met Stokes.
CLEVELAND, Ohio, April 28.âSur
rounded by many of her old shop
mates and many other girls who know
her only as the fiancee of J. G. Phelps
Stokes, Miss Rose Pastor to-day rolled
cigars at her old work bench in Marcus
Feder's cigar factory.
She picked up the filler, straightened
it on a wrapper and "deftly rolled the
latter, whisking off the ragged edsres
with a cirgarmaker's knife and sealins:
the tip with gum, as an expert does.
The first cigar went a little slowly. but
it has been two years since Miss Pastor
left that bench. The second and third
were made more quickly. Those fol
lowing were tossed into the molds as
fast as any of the girls could have
done.
The foreman declared that Miss Pas
tor had not lost any of her old-time
skill. When the news of her achieve
ment reached the members of the firm.
they took the cigars made by Miss
Pastor to keep as souvenirs. Her old
shopmates gave her a rousing welcome
when she appeared in the workroom.
In her address to them, she urged all
to Btrive to better their condition by
study and advised the organization of
social clubs, where all problems of
their lives could be discussed.

General Agsnt of
the 31issonri Pacific Be
fore the Senate Committee
QUESTIONED BY ELKINS
Witness Explains Why Ad
vance Was Made on the
Charges for All Livestock
WASHINGTON, April 28.â James C.
Lincoln, general freight agent of the
Missouri Pacific Railroad, continued
his statement before the Senate Com
mittee on Interstate Commerce to-day.
He said that at times the Missouri
Pacific charged a less rate than fixed
by the commission.
Chairman Elkins asked a number of
questions relative to the advances
made on livestock rates, which he said,
were the cause of the greatest com
plaint. Lincoln replied that the ratÂ«s,
owing to competition, were very low
before the advances were made. He
thought the rates too low now.
Replying to questions about private
car lines, Lincoln explained that the
American Refrigerator Transit Com
pany, In which the Missouri Pacific
was a stockholder, operated on that
line. This company had more than
four thousand cars. The private car
company* made the charges for refrig
eration. Owing to the interest of the
Missouri Pacific in the American Re
frigerator Transit Company, it prefer
red to use the cars of the latter com
pany, although it did operate other
cars and furnished ice for such cars.
There were complaints of high charges
for icing the private cars of the Ameri
can Refrigerator Transit Company and
also other cars.
A. C. Bird, who is an officer of the
Missouri Pacific and also an officer of
the refrigerator company, had charge
of the private cars of the railroad.
"Then does he make the contract*
with himself?" asked Chairman Elkins.
"Yes," replied Lincoln.
It was announced that Bird would
appear before the committee.
George R. Peck, general connsel of
the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul
road, then was heard by the commit
tee.
At the conclusion of Peck's formal
statement the committee adjourned as
a mark of respect to Senator Dolliver.
a member of the committee, whose
father died to-day.

CALL. BUREAU, PON BUILDING.
WASHINGTON. April 28.â Dispat< hÂ«a
from London, quoting the Daily Graph
ic's declaration that many of the thir-
ty-flve caliber twelve-inch guns in thÂ«
royal navy were incapable of firing riX
ty full charges attracted prompt atten
tion in the highest naval circles. Tha"
problem of deteriorating ordnance ia
one of the most vital before the Ameri
can service to-day, as many of our na
val guns are rendered almost vaiueleaa
by erosion.
Rear Admiral Converse, Chief of the
Bureau of Navigation, before the Housa
Committee on Naval Affairs, last win
ter stated that it had become necessary
to begin relining many of the guns In
the American navy, their tubes having
been badly worn by erosion from pow
der. He stated that the British navy
considered 150 rounds about the limit
of fire for large guns. It is pointed out
here that the British navy's favorite
ammunition, cordite, is more wearing
on gun linings than the smo-keless pow
der used in the American navy.
The ordnance experts of the navy ar*
giving to this problem their closest at
tention. The blowing off of muzzles of
three eight-inch and one twelve-inch
gun on the lowa within two years has
demonstrated the necessity of using
this type of ordnance, which is dupli
cated on other ships, with reduced
powder charges, which gives smaller
velocities and diminishes the striking
power.

LIGHT THROWN
ON WHEAT DEAL
Doubt as to Whether Gates'
Interests AYere Acting En
tirely in Good Faith
FEW 1\ MANIPULATION
Armour People Are Now {Said
to Have Been Short on
Several Million Bushels
Dispatch to The Call.
NEW YORK. April 28.â Now that
some of the inner workings of the May
wheat deal in Chicago have come to
light, people are wondering whether the
alleged attempt on the part of the
Gates interest* to corner wheat was
really made in good faith. Until the
defalcation in Milwaukee became
known, no rumor of outside interests
in the May speculation In Chicago
reached the East. For two months
prices have been held above $1 10 by
what was evidently the manipulation
of but few, If any, outside of the Chi
cago pit, and there was no suspicion
that several million bushels were be
ing held for the Northwestern banker
who was putting up all his own securi
ties to protect his interest and in a
frantic effort to boost prices was bor
rowing right and left and finally, in
sheer desperation, hypothecated funds
of the institution of which he was
president.
About two months ago it was rum
ored that the Gates party In New York
had accumulated a line of anywhere
from 10.000.000 to 25.000,000 bushels of
May wheat. The actual supply of
wheat in Chicago was considerably less
than 5,000.000 bushels and it needed no
very astute mathematical calculation
to figure out a very troublesome time
for the people who had been fool
hardy enough to sell May wheat
| short, if the reports of the size of the
long interest wore correct. It was
! generally known that the Armour ln
i terests were short of several million
bushels of May contracts. It is not
believed that this was in the nature
! of a speculative venture, but was slm
j ply hedge sales of May contracts
i against the actual wheat stored in
their own elevators. But the Armour
| people would like to sell their cash
i wheat to the millers and have it pass
' into consumption. As long as the price
â of futures was so much above the
! price of contract wheat, it was diffi
cult to cover without loss and so the
wheat wof held.
P. A. Valentine, representative of
the Armour interests on the Chicago
Board of Trade, came to New York
and a conference was held in the of
fice of Charles G. Gates & Co.
In the light of recent develop
ments, it wag learned at that confer
ence that a third long interest in May
wheat was in the *market and from
that time dates the doom of the May
wheat deal.
COUNT OF FLANDERS' SON
MAY INHERIT A THRONE
King of Belgium and Others Discuss
Advisability of Making Prince
Albert Heir Presumptive.
LONDON*, April 28.â A dispatch
from Antwerp to the Daily Telegraph
states that King Leopold, the Count of
Flanders (brother of the King) and
the Belgian Finance Minister are de
bating the advisability of making the
Count of Flanders' son, Prince Albert,
the legal heir presumptive to the
throne of Belgium by obtaining Par
liamentary sanction for the Count of
Flanders' renunciation, already agreed
upon, of his claim to the succession.
It is feared, however, that the So
cialists in the Chamber of Deputies
will violently oppose the measure, es
pecially as it^e also proposed to trans
fer the Count of Flanders' allowance
of 140,000 yearly to Prince Albert,
who is poor. The Socialists and Pro
gressives want to suppress this allow
ance on the ground that as both King
Leopold and the Count of Flanders are
millionaires they ought to provide for
the heir presumptive out of their pri
vate funds.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. APRIL' 29, 1905.
ARMY OFFICER
NOT ELIGIBLE
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SAX DIEGO, April 28. â Judge Tor
rance to-day overruled a demurrer
filed by Mayor-elect John L. Sehon to
the contest of his election brought by
ex-Mayor D. C. Reed to determine
Sehon's eligibility to serve as Mayor of
San Diego. Judge Torrance also de
nied the motion made by Sehon's at
torneys for a dismissal of the case.
The contest was brought to deter
mine whether Captain Sehon, who is a
retired United States army officer, oc
cupies a lucrative office under the
Government, and whether the office
of Mayor is created under the consti
tution of this State. Judge Torrance
held that Captain Sehon is still an of
ficer of the United States army and
not an honorary pensioner. The court
also held that the office of Mayor is
created under the State constitution,
which prohibits any person holding a
lucrative office under the United States
Government from occupying a civil
office of profit.
It is understood that Sehon will re
fuse to file an answer and that when
Judgment is given against him he will
appeal to the Appellate Court. This
will enable him to assume the office
of Mayor next Monday.

which has been brewing in the con
struction department of the Mare Isl

FOR NAVY YARD
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALLEJO, April 28.â 1t is believed
here that the ordnance department of
Mare Island is destined to become a
department of great importance in the
navy. The principal ordnance station
of the navy is located at the Washing

employed. It has been planned to con
struct two more "filling houses" on
Mare Island to accommodate the rap
idly growing business of the depart
ment.
The ammunition for the Asiatic and
Pacific squadrons is now assembled at
this yard. It is the intention of the
Navy Department to have all the
squadrons hold extensive target prac
tice in the future, thus increasing the
demand for ammunition, and, in con
sequence, the importance of Mare Isl
and. These plans will necessitate an
increase in the ordnance department
force.

San Francisco and Talagoo
Teams to Meet in Exhibi
tion Contest Sunday.
The San Francisco Lacrosse Club
team and the representatives of the
Talagroos of San Mateo will meet to
morrow at 2:30 p. m. on C. W. Clark's
private dolo field at San Mateo. The
line-up of the two teams will be nearly
the same as on the Presidio athletic
ground last Sunday. A meeting of the
tournament committee was held on
Monday evening in San Mateo, at
which the schedule for the coming
season was discussed and arranged.
The opening match for the champion
ship of 1905 will be played on Sunday,
May 14, and will be between the San
Francisco and Olympic teams.
The lacrosse players of San Fran
cisco and the rest of the State are
looking forward to the coming sea
son with great hope. It is believed
the standard of play will be higher
and the contests better than in any
previous year. Lacrosse players, like
association footballers, feel the best
thing for the popularity of the game
would be for the universities and
schools to take it up, and they hope
the Canadians at Stanford may be
able to arouse interest enough to get
up a team there. Lacrosse is a
splendid game, requiring good train
ing, speed, skill and pluck. It is also
essentially a team game, and there
fore well adapted to colleges and
schools. Once popular interest is
aroused in the game enthusiasm will
spread quickly.

.THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY, APRIL 29, 1905
ANGLERS SHOW
FULL CREELS
Trout Are Taking the Fly
With Avidity on Many
Nearby Streams.
To the surprise of the angling fra
ternity the trout are taking the fly
with avidity on many streams and the
season seems unusually far advanced.
The first definite information as to the
Kiamath is contained In the following
letter from Al Cummlng, the well
known sportsman:
The Kiamath River ie lower this year than
I have ever seen it and the fish seem to take
any oid thing. The weather is warm and
the salmon and cadis bugs are almost full>
matured. The flies will probably be out in
about a week. I landed thirty-two rainbow
trout yesterday, gome as high as two pounds
in weight. I can safely recommend the fishing
her* lor the next five months It. come. Th>;
creeks are almost In condition for fly fishing.
The season is about a month earlier than
usual. I will remain here until about the
26th of May and will be pleased to put any
one in touch with the sport.
To corroborate his statement he sent
a grand box of rainbow trout to a
friend here. The fish were In good
condition and of unusual size.
The anglers on the upper Sacra
mento expect good sport soon, as the
river is reported lower than any time
last season. Several good catches
have been made at Sims, but the trout
are not rising to the fly well at pres
ent. The fishing is good in the streams
on the Mills Ranch. Mr. Mills charges
(1 per rod and limits the catch to
twenty fish. The water in the nearby
streams is going down rapidly.
Persons who know the Truckee well
have been surprised at advices received
from there to the effect that the trout
are taking the fly at this early date.
The recent rains interfered some
what with fishing in the Santa Cruz
streams, but it will be good again
next month. Many four and five
pounders were taken recently In the
San Lorenzo. Supervisor Miller and
Tax Collector Helms caught four in
Big Creek which scaled from four to
six pounds. Other anglers did well in
Scott and Waddell creeks.
A. Hegele and Mr. Edwards fished
the Aptos recently and secured nearly
the limit of six to twelve inch fish.
The Paper Mill is affording great fly
fishing throughout ite entire length.
The water is pron6unced grand by an
admirer of the stream and there are
more fish there than In many years.
A continuance of the present weather
will make the sport still better.
Among the well-known men who had
good sport last Sunday were L. Daver
kosen. Jim Turner, J. Thompson and
W. A. L. Miller.
Bert Spring and Charles Breidenstein
took a number of fine fish between
Garcia and Tocaloma on the fly. They
preserved a number of them alive for
an- aquarium In this city.
Among the men who did well at
Point Reyes on Sunday were George
Wentworth, Sam Wells, Frank Dol
liver, Abe Banker and Andy Legaspie.
The favorite flies in use are the royal
coachman, grey and brown hackle, red
ant and.blue upright.
Joe Uri hooked and landed 'a four
pound steelhead at Grassy Point, near
Point Reyes, last Saturday evening.
He first caught a small chub which
he used for bait. The steelhead put
up a game fight for ten minutes.

CRICKET DAYS
NEAR AT HAND
May Arrange Series of Cham
pion ship Games for Port
land Exposition.
The schedule of sports to be held at
the Lewis and Clark Exposition allots
September 13, 14 and 15 to cricket
championship games. The crleketers
in Tacoma, Victoria, B. C, and else
where on the Pacific Coast are de
sirous of making up teams to take part
in these championship contests. The
States of California, Oregon and
Washington, #ith the mainland of
British Columbia and Vancouver Isl
and, would furnish five teams. If each
team played the others and a final
match were played between the two
teams that had won the most games,
eleven matches would be required. J.
Lawrence, a Tacoma cricketer, and E.
C. Hilton, a brother of one of the vice
Dresidents of the California Cricket
Association, are bestirring themselves
in the matter. It should be possible
to make up quite a strong team from
the six affiliated clubs In California.
T. W. Tetley, L. E. Duquesne and
William Carnie have been elected
members of the San Francisco County
Cricket Club. T. W. Tetley played last
season with the Pacific Club. He has
recently returned from a visit of seven
or eight months to England. L. E.
Duqueene is well known as an associa
tion football player.
Motorists to Go to San Jose.
The circular issued by L. P. Lowe,
chairman of the executive committee
of the Automobile Club of California,
to the members states that a club run
will be made to San Jose to-day. No
regular schedule has been prepared
and the automobilists will reach the
rendezvous, the Hotel Vendome, at any
hour and by any route that may be
agreeable to them.
If enough members are on hand an
informal meeting will bft held at the
hotel from 8:30 to 9 o'clock to-night.
From 9 to 11 there will be music and
dancing in the ballroom, and at 11
o'clock a supper will be served to the
motorists and their friends. The swim
ming tank will be open to the visitors
during their stay.
Inasmuch as the management of
the hotel desires to know the number
of visitors for whom it will have to
provide, members of the club are re
quested to inform the manager as to
the number of their party and the
probable time of "their arrival. The
members are also requested to pay
careful attention, especially in the
towns through which they pass, to the
provisions of the new State law regu
lating the speed and operation of mo
tor cars.

Bass fishing at San Pablo is good.
Bert Spring and Jack McGovern

Tuesday. The largest weighed six
pounds. Among the other bass fisher
men who have been enjoying the sport
are Frank Marcus. F. Wick, G. Pom

have been out regularly twice each
week and excellent sport has been
shown by the pack.
Owing to the nature of the fences and
the necessity of running over friendly
territory a "drag hunt is substituted
for the fox or the hare, the usual
game tn Europe. The country over
which the club has the privilege of
hunting is of the finest possible char
acter. Much of it is undulating pas
ture land and if sod banks could be
substituted for the panel in the fence
at the point where the scent is laid
all conditions would be ideal.
For the greater part of the season
the conditions of weather and ground
are as near perfection as could be de
sired and form as picturesque a hunt-
Ing country as the sun ever shone on.
CLOSE SEASON
IS INEVITABLE
Omitting Promoters Finally
Beach a Conclusion Appar
ent to Others for Years.
The promoters of coursing have final
ly reached the conclusion that there
must be a cessation of the sport here
after for a number of months each
year. This has been recommended for
years by persons interested in the
highest development of the sport, but
the promoters would not listen to it.
The possible extinction of the hares
has forced the situation upon them.
The ciaim was always made that to
stop would be to drive all the owners
out of the game and to scatter the bet
tors. This weak argument would ap
ply equally well to horseracing, which
thrives on a season of 150 days.
At the present time men are keeping
up expensive strings of greyhounds
which have few opportunities to course.
If the season was a limited one these
dogs would be thrown out of training
and led on soft food, which would be
inexpensive as compared with that
which they require when they are run
ning.
The running must stop after the
first rains next winter or else Oregon,
Nevada, Idaho and Utah must be
drawn on for hares. Whether they will
prove satisfactory remains to be seen.
Weather conditions will have much to
do with it.
The intermittent showers in the San
Joaquin Valley are blamed for the
present shortage. These keep up the
green feed and the hares are scattered
over a wide area of country. One hot
week in the valley if expected to work
wonders in the supply of the little fly
ers.
The train for Union Park to-morrow
will leave at 10:30 o'clock. It will not
stop at Valencia street. The best four
dogs in the class stake seem to be:
The Referee. Qulta, Rocker Arm and
Tillie R. The last four in the reserve
stake should be: Pomona, Secretive.
Presto and Sea Lion. The likely win
ners:

YOUNG EXPERTS
IN TENNIS PLAY
High School Boys Will Meet
for the Academic Athletic
League Championships.
Many a month has passed since the
tennis players have allowed a week's
end to go by without playing a tourn
ament match of some kind. To-day
and to-morrow will be given over en
tirely to practice on this side of the
hay. On the East Oakland courts a
doubles tournament will be played
this morning for the championship of
the Academic Athletic League. Al
though the event is open to all the
preparatory schools the seven teams
entered are from schools in San Fran
cisco and Alameda counties only. The
teams drew us follows:
Charles Foley and Harold Getz
(Polytechnic) vs. Richard Belcher
and Roy Butler (Oakland High); W.
Foster and W. Sherwood (Alameda
High) vs Melville and Herbert Long
(Lowell High); Marius Hotchklss and
Harold Gabriel (Lick) vs. Cheney and
Powell (Berkeley High); F. St. John
and E. Lagarde ( Wilmerding), a bye.
The only school across the bay fig
ured to have a chance is Oakland
High, and it is not at all probable it
will beat the representatives of the lo
cal schools. On tfiis side of the bay
it is figured the championship lies be
t\ve#n the Long brothers and Hotch
kiss and Gabriel. These four boys
are all high class players for young
sters and will furnish some good ten
nis. The Long brothers look best on
paper, but they cannot be depended
upon. If things do not go smoothly
they are likely to go up in the air.
Gabriel and Hotchkisa are both good
individual players, but have had but
little practice together. Gabriel is like
the Longs, and if he gets a good start
he will play a game that will surprise
the spectators. Hotchkiss is the least
brilliant of the four, but he is by long
odds the steadiest.
Polytechnic has one of the best
players in the league in Foley, but he
will have rather a weak and inex
perieced partner.
The Academic Athletic League sin
gles will be played on May 13 on the
California Club courts. This event will
be one of the most interesting since
the inauguration of tennis in the
league. It will bring together such
clever young players as H. Long. C.
Foley. H. Gabriel and many others
from the bay counties.
The experts are already practicing
hard for the coming San Francisco
championship tournament. This event
will be played on the California Club
courts on May 20. It will possess less
class than in former years, but there
will be a merry scramble for first
honors. Percy Murdock is the present
champion and will probably defend
his title. Many figure it a certainty
that George Baker will win the tourn
ament and will meet Murdock for the
championship. On past performances
Baker is undoubtedly the best, but
there are several young players com
ing to the front rapidly who must be
conceded a chance. Baker is not im
proving, while players like the Longs,
Gardener, Foley and Janes have by
no means reached their limit.
The second tournament for the Van
Vliet cup will be played by the mem
bers of the Ladies' Annex on Tuesday.
The trophy is in the possession of
Mrs. C. Watson, who beat Miss Van
Vliet in the finals of the last tourna
ment.
Of the English poloists F. J. alackey.
Sir George Prescott and Captain de
Crespigny all availed of the oppor
tunity of following the hounds during
their sporting pilgrimage to this
coast- Mr. Mac-key, who has hunted
extensively in England, had one of his
best hunters here.
Francis J. < "Art/lan, the master of
i the hunt, seldom missed a day afield,
' his favorite mount being Merry Boy.
. which has carried him safely and well
for several seasons.
Jerry Keating, the clever huntsman,
is invariably well mounted, as owners
are glad to have him accept a mount
for the education he will give a horse.

; figure on his big gray horse Royalty in
J other years, was no* seen in the saddle

Old R!p Van Haltren awoke from his
eiumbers in the thirteenth spasm yes
terday afternoon at Recreation Park,
and came through with a hit to the
right garden that broke up a game of
baseball that will be a nightmare for
the fans for many a moon. There was
l.fe. action and ginger in ever/ minute
of the great contest and it was either
teams for the asking many times. Score
â Oakland 4, San Francisco 3.
There were sensational plays, good
hits, accurate pegging to the bags and,
in fact, everything that one would like
Or see come off in a hot mix-up. Oak
land did not seem to have a chance to
even tie the score in the ninth, yet
they did the trick cleverly and so the
game progressed.
Jimmy .Byrnes started the Commu
m their victorious career in the
thirteenth by chopping a fast one past
Gocnnauer. Iberg was there with the
big bunt and then old Papa Van came
up, club in mitt. Ha had struck out
tv.ice before, so he was ready .to re-
GÂ«m himself. After taking two
strikes, Van swung cm the next one
and away out to the right field fence
ji went. Byrnes kept on coming and
the great game was but a memory.
Wi'h the score 3 to 2 in favor of the
Seals in the ninth period, Dunieavy
landed for a double-sacker out to cen
ter. Streib put him to third on an
out. Kelly made the second out and
affairs looked bad. Wheeler then exe
cuted a wild pitch and Dunieavy land
ed with the one that created the long
deadlock.
Both pitchers were working their |
shoots in a manner that would buffalo ;
the best batters in the business. Ham
IbÂ»rg depended on his floater, and I^ '
was the candy in nearly every round. ;
Wheeler kept sticking 'em over the
pan and the Commuters were baffled
most of the time. He fanned eleven ;
men and did not issue a pass.
Gochnauer gave an exhibition erf field
ing that has never been surpassed at ,
the Eighth-street lot. In the second
inning "he ran back of second after
Streib's hit and threw the German out.
He made a wonderful stop of one from
Kelly's bat right after that and then
grabbed a liner that Devereaux hit,
doubling up the Red one after making
the putout at second base. The score: j

THE SAX FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. APRTTJ 29, 1905.
Atz Ceases to Be an Idol
When He Makes Wide
Throw.
Giant> IMay Without Ginger,
So tigers Have Another
Feast. .
PORTLAND, April 2S.â After the
Giants had the game won twice, Jakey
Atz ringed the ball into the land of
bleachers and tossed the game away.
Bobby Keefe and Bill Essick were the
opposing curvsters. Both twirlers were
getting their bumps good and hard,
but the Giants were massing theirs
until that weird heave came, when
they dogged it and thÂ« Tigers won
pulled up.
Keefe walked enough men to have
lost three games, but there was no
ginger in the Giants' play. When
things began breaking badly they as
sumed the take-it-it's-yours attitude.
On the other hand the pennant-chasers
from Tacoma were on their toes all
the time. In the sixth Inning they
drove three runs over the pan. They
annexed another in the eighth, giving
them a total of seven. The score:

HIGH SCHOOL BALL TEAMS
TO MEET ON THE FIELD
Lick Nine to Play Polytechnic To-
Day on the Presidio Athletic
Grounds.
The baseball schedule of the sub
league of the Academic Athletic
League includes two promising con
tests to be played to-day. Inter
est runs high with all the "prep"
school fans as to who will come out
on top in the coming struggle between
Lick and Polytechnic schools. Mis
sion is expected to have to play the
best specimen of ball it possesses
when the team meets the delegation
from the Wilmerding institution.
Lowell was slated to cross bats with
the Cogrwell tossers, but the game
was postponed upon Cogswell's re
quest.
Polytechnic has created surprise by
defeating the Lowell players. Had it
not been protested it would have been
on a better footing than any of the
other contesting teams. Because of
this unexpected exhibition of talent
the game with Lick will go a great
way toward fixing its standing. The
teams will line up:
Lick vs. Polytechnic: Liek â White, pitcher;

High School Nines to Meet Again.
The committee of the Academic
Athletic League decided yesterday
that the Lick-Lowell baseball game,
which occasioned a protest from Lick,
must be entirely replayed, the con
test to take place on or before May
13. This removes the only hitch in
the baseball sub-league. The protest
upon which the interest of the entire
sub-league hinged was that in the
Lick-Lowell case. Either Lick or
Lowell will win the final honors.
After the withdrawing of Lowell
from the ground Lick did not demand
the game, but asked either to com
plete the interrupted contest or to
play a new game.

STAFFORD UNIVERSITY, April 23.
The first international baseball game
between teams representing Japan and
America will take place to-morrow aft
ernoon. The game will be played on
Stanford campus between the var
pity nine from Stanford University and
the nine little brown men from Waseda
University, the largest college of the
Eastern empire. The contest has at
tracted widespread interest. What the
Japanese team will be able to do is
a matter of mere speculation. Certain
it is they will field with equal If not
greater precision than their American
rivals. Batting is likely to prove the
weakness that jvill be their undoing.
The Asiatic team of ball tossers are
veterans of the game. Every player has
become well seasoned by years of
steady practice. They are the cham
pions of their country, this position
having been gained by winning a long
series of games with the teams from
other Japanese colleges. Iso Abe. their
manager, says the players are a steady
lot and have never been known to
go into the air at any stage of the
gams. This assertion, together with
the superb practice the ttam has put
up during the last few days, goes to
show that the struggle to-morrow will
be no walk-away for the Stanford col
legians.
Kono. the diminutive pitcher, will de
pend mostly on control and straight
balls. He has lots of speed and seem
ingly perfect control. He has a. shoulder
ball that is likely to prove a bugbear
to the hit column of the cardinal bats
men. Kono also uses an out drop that
was taught him by an old Yale pitcher
who was teaching for a time in Japan.
Kono's offerings will be received by a
little dark Jap, with a snappy whip
that iviil nip in the bud any attempt
to purloin an extra bag.
Sales will pitch the first game for
Stanford, and will depend upon his
curves to fool the visitors. The line
up of the two teams will be as follows:

O'Brien went out to Worth track early
this morning and served notice on all
the horsemen located there that there
would be no racing at Worth. It was
a sad disappointment to the many
stables quartered on the grounds.
More than 400 head of horses are in
the bp.rns.
S. C. Hildreth. who has charge of
the Smathers' string of thirty-one, at

horses in the Smathers stable. Other
horsemen arranged to ship to St.
Louis. Kansas City. Nashville, Louis

opens within a few days. Some of the
poorer owners are left in bad shape,

Long Shot Players Roll

Again.
FRED E. MULHOLLAND
"Lucky" Baldwin's big sprinter Cru
zados, shouldering 126 pounds, set a
pace in the six and a half furlong
handicap at Oakland yesterday that
would have kept Barney Oldfleld and
his famous 999 busy, and then lost to
Honiton. If the extra half furlong
could have been clipped off the result
might have been different, tho-ugh this
is doubtful. Honiton carried Knapp
and 120 pounds and enjoyed first call
in the betting. The Baldwin sprinter
experienced little difficulty in shaking
off the other starters when Dick Dwyer
released the barrier. Turning into the
stretch Cruzados had a lead of two
lengths, but even then the favorite
looked a winner. As Cruzados weak
ened the great mare closed on him and
at the wire won handily by a neck in
1:19 flat. Gold Enamel, a liberally sup
ported one, finished third after an un
even voyage.
UPSETS ARE FREQUENT.
Upsets were frequent, Cloudlight,
Funnyside, Dusty Miller and I'm Joe
converting the "dope" book into a
comic almanac. The handicap winner
and High Chancellor were the two
lucky choice*.
Abe Meyer had first call in the bet
ting in the two-year-old dash, and I'm
Joe made him look like a deuce. The
winner had J. Clark up and at odds of
4 to 1, jumped away in the lead, dis
posing of the first choice without, an
effort. Iron Watson, a 15 to 1 shot,
took the show from St. Francis.
Dr. Rowell's filly Mistress of Rolls
was installed favorite for the seven
and a half furlong event. She was sore
and unfit and the money bet on her
was burned up before the horses left
the paddock. Cloudlight. a2O to 1 shot
piloted by Tommy Taylor, spread
eagled the field. Bob Ragon moved up
from a seat in the back row, downing
Bailey half a length for the place.
FUNNYSLDE CREATES A STIR.
On top of this came the ludicrous re
versal of Funnyside, winner of the mile
and 100 yards sketch. The mare start
ed in a seven furlong run last Mon
day, but the gentlemen who smoke
would have none of her. Yesterday she
created a profound stir in the betting,
then went out in front, leading from
start to finish. Knapp had the mount
on Rey Dare, the favorite, finishing
second, four lengths before Fortunatus.
Mai Lowery ran a clever race, al
though unplaced.
Judging from his exhibition in the
mile and a sixteenth selling fixture,
Dusty Miller must have been run over
by a street sweeping machine since
his appearance on Wednesday last.
Then he was Just entering the stretch
as the other starters were being cooled
out. Twenty to 1 was accepted about
him yesterday, and he came home an
easy winner after cutting out all the
pace. Judge Denton, the favorite, ran
third, behind Sheriff Bell. Royalty
failed to show any speed.
An even money chance, High Chan
cellor, ridden by McÃride, won the
closing six-furlong event in a gallop.
Tocolaw, after a stormy trip, got up
In time to snatch the place from Ruby.
TRACK NOTES.
When Achelita collided with St.
Francis in the stretch and fell, Al
Minder fortunately escaped with a se
vere shaking up.
When Dusty Miller started in the
third race on Wednesday his owners,
Thomas & Co., asked and were grant
ed permission to run the horse with
out blinkers. On that occasion Dusty
received a bump at the first turn,
after which he refused to try. Yes
terday Thomas & Co. stated they
would like to try blinkers on the horse
again. At one stage of the betting the
price about Dusty touched 10 to 1 and
he won easily. The Judges ordered
the entries of the firm refused in fu
ture.
This being Fabiola day at the track,

. declaring that while we have plenty of iron ore
* w cannot rater into omnpctitioa with Eastern iron produc
because the railroads will not let us.
\\Y <io not think this is a full statement of the reason. It <s
known that we have abundant iron ore in forty-one counties in
this Slate, and probably there are many other undiscovered de
posits. Fine iron was found at Clipper Gap, in Placer County,
! a mine was opened there. The Central Pacific Railway made
â¢raet for the pig-iron for use in its shops that was very lucra
tbe mine owners, and the ledge was opened, using wood
a smelting fuel. After quite extended and profitable operation,
mine shot down. One reason given was the lack of fuel,
another that the vein pinched. Whatever the reason was the
nstry ceased while the railway kept its part of the contract.
It : "eessarv to seek in overland freight rates the rea-
B mihy we make no iron, though the ore is abundant. We have
smelting fuel. Richly endowed with everything else, California
lacks coal. It takes wood a long time to grow. It is at best a
fective smelting fuel and no iron industry can be permanently
founded if dependent upon its use. The State of Washington has
n ore. coal for smelting and limestone for flux. We have the
ore, m association with limestone, but we have no coal. Some
our ore. like that at Clipper Gap, is of the finest quality. With
associated coal it would yield a fine profit and there is plenty of
lL But lacking coal it is of no value.
:r manufactures would be greatly stimulated if we could
:r own iron. It is the king of the Ijase metals. The
structural iron and steel is now a necessity in the building
trader We have discovered that buildings with a metal skeleton
are earthquake proof and that style of construction is in almost
â se A local iron industry would effect economies in a
-mters and would locate here the skilled labor lhat
is now employed in the East in furnishing the supply we need. If
our iron ore* w*re brought into action a large increase in the
value of our mining industry would follow. Our limestone de
posh^ would acquire value and a new feature would appear
<n our manufacturing activities. But none of this can
boat a smelting fuel. Coal and coke rule the iron industry.
heed with the ore in the cupola, the heat and flux are properly
ributed and the ore yields its value in pig.
far no efficient substitute has been found. The discovery
fine fuel oil here has made coal unnecessary in steam plants. It
has given a great impulse to manufacturing and to agriculture,
because its distillates furnish a cheap power for pump irrigation.
ppleraented by the conversion of hydraulic power into electric
â  _ oil has put the State in possession of the cheapest power
known, and one of the easiest of transmission. If we smelted
our own iron this cheap power would immediately advance our
rank as a manufacturing State. Railroad rates have nothing to
do with a smelting fuel. If inventive genius can make crude oil
ihe duty of coal in a smelting cupola the problem would be
ved. It has been tried, but the devices used did not secure
â tusion of the heat. It forms a cone within which the smelting
omplete. but there is no effect beyond that.
Heretofore all efforts have been directed to diffusion in the
â¢ola. No one seems to have inquired if the cupola is the only
rm in which fuel, ore and flux can be properly co-ordinated in
smelting. The cupola has been accepted as the end of invention
in that line. So. the principle of the flail for threshing grain and
l the for cutting it were long accepted as the end of
invention in those processes, and much ingenuity was wasted in
tl to apply power to the scythe and flail. When invention
fot entirely away from those primitive instruments and adopted
the concave and cylinder for threshing and the toothed sickle and
bar for cutting grain, the problem was solved. May we not enter
upon the iron age of California by changing the principle of the
cupola into another form? Of course diffusion of heat in the
existing form should not be abandoned as impossible. A study
combustion may accomplish it.
As a practical matter, if our iron manufacturing industry would
Stimulate invention by offering a cash prize, and a large one, for
an invention that will practically apply oil to smelting, men of
genius in that line will go at the problem all over the country
. i it will undoubtedly be solved. Our crude oij producers may
well join in this effort. A new use for oil as valuable as this will
raise that industry out of the depression of which complaint <s
made, and a line of light and ch^er will come upon all related in
dustries.
CALIFORNIA IRON.
GOULD STRIPS FOR WORK.
GOULD'S resignation of directorship in the Harriman roads
is accounted for by himself on the ground that he is going
build the Western Pacific and it is not proper for him
to be a director of a competing line. His presence in the Union
Pacific directory was supposed to mean the primacy of the Gould
interest in that road, and to imply the final ousting of Mr. Harriman.
It is not thinkable that Gould would parallel a line which he
already controlled, so he must have represented a minority holding,
which he will doubtless let go.
This last move seems to make sure the construction of the j
Western Pacific, and in that expectation an ambitious scheme I
appears in Oakland for tunneling the bay, to give the new line I
direct access to San Francisco. As to that we are of the opinion !
both cities will have to be content with another ferry for a long
time.
The Western Pacific is the most ambitious piece of new con
struction ever undertaken by the Goulds. The founder of the family
was in the habit of buying disabled roads cheap, equipping them,
giving them important connections, putting them on the stock mar
ket and selling them dear. In that way, stock jobbing in railways,
the foundation of the family fortune was made. The sons, however,
treat the running of railroads as a business and the Gould system
is an important part of the railway mileage of the country.
If they build the Western Pacific and give us the first through
service from ocean to ocean without change of cars, they will
render an essential service to California. They will only pioneer
En that line, for the other roads will be forced by such competition
to make Eastern connections, at Chicago or St. Louis, ur by the
Joiiet cutoff, that will enable them to give a through service also.
When ;hat is done the time from San Francisco to New York
will be less than four days, and that is fast enough to suit the most
r2pid traveler.

ing â¢ each other.
Bince no one had
introduced them, j
The Sawyers
were of the opin
ion that all stu-'
dents who attend
ed the same
schools were
bound to be the
best of friends; the
Sawyer women
had all attended
boarding schools
where this had
been the rule and
acquaintances h i p
the exception. The
men were of the
genial kind who
made a friend out
of the merest
chance meeting.
They took it for
granted that their
old friend. War
render, should be
acquainted with
their old friend,
Martha Blakely.
"Isn't she a clev
er girl?" demand
ed Gertrude Saw
yer of Warrender.
Warrender had
heard Miss Blake
ly's recitations for
several quarters
and was qualified
STRANGEKS.
to talk of her intellectual ability. {
There being no other topic of conver
sation on the mental horizon at the
time, he talked upon the topic en
thusiastically.
When Martha Blakely paid her next
weekly visit to the Sawyers she was
told at once of the glowing compli
ments that Warrender had paid her.
Martha was too surprised to state that
she had never met her fellow student.
Upon consideration. however, she
thought that it would be very rude of
her to deny the acquaintanceship as
long as Warrender had seen fit to say
such pleasant things of her. In fact,
she thought it incumbent on her to !
return the comDliment.
Her remarks having been repeated
to Warrender, he added a few more
compliments to his original state
ments, thus starting a game of ping
pong between the girl and himself of
which the Sawyers furnished the net.
Ang all the time they passed each
other every day on the campus with
out pretending to be aught but the
veriest strangers to each other.
Had either of them been endowed ]
with a vivid sense of humor they
would have terminated such an ab
rupt situation long before they did. 1
But Martha Blakely was the prim
mest of proper maidens and would no
more have thought of addressing
Warrender without an introduction
than she would of jumping into the
lake in January. Warrender, for his
part, was reserved and shy, and suf
fered agonies of remorse for his rash ,
words concerning Miss Blakely. His
Puritanic conscience kept assuring
him that he would
have to pay the j
price for that pre- j
varication. and he
expected the price
to be some partic- 1
ularly embarrass
ing; situation.
He paid the
price. TheSawyera,
with mistaken hos
pitality, mvi ted
Martha Blakely
and himself to a
dinner. There were
to have been oth
er guests, but
something or oth
er prevented their
coming and the
two unfortunate
victims of their
own rashness were
left to their de
struction without
even a chance to
escape. Gertrude
Sawyer began it at
the door.
"W * th o ught
that Martha and
you would come
together," she said
to "Warren der,
while he tried to
mumble out some
excuse about not
having seen Mis?
Blakely. "W h y,
here she is now,"
she con ti n ued.
"Harold was just
saying that he had
not seen you all
week. That is a
long time for peo
people who are
such friends."
AT THE DOOR
Warrender was
relieved to see that Miss Blakely was
as nervous as *was he himself. It
! would have seemed that the entire
| Sawyer family had conspired to add
to their discomfiture. They related
and repeated all the agreeable re
marks that each had made of the
other. Gertrude Sawyer fancied that
she detected in their embarrassment
some symptoms of an incipient ro
! ma nee and set about some systematic
1 teasing.
It was the unhappiest evening that
either of the students had ever spent.
!It was a lesson in practical ethics.
They dared not look at each other,
and all the time the Sawyers smiled
under the delusion that the dinner
was a great success.
Of course there was no way out of
it. They had to go home together.
Gertrude Sawyer thought the arrange
ment ideal. The two who had been
60 devoted to mutual praises never
spoke one word to each other on the
Journey. They bow to each other for
mally now on the campus. But their
reticence is decidedly noticeable.

THE attraction of personality ; to

AN IDLE WISH.
Oh. give me back the good old days;
I want the simple life,
The care-free times before we knew
Bacteria were rife.
We never boiled the crystal stream
The oaken bucket drew,
And if our mud pies reeked with germs
At least we never knew.
But now we boil and bake and steam
And disinfect and burn.
We wash, and spray and shake and air
And fume and scrape and churn.
We think it will prolong our days,
No nook or cranny. shirk,
And just as every microbe flees
We die of overwork.
BABY SHOPLIFTER.
An apparently respectable matron,
carrying an ostensible baby in long
clothes, was observed fumbling at a
stall in one of the big shops of the
Rue de Rivoli. Paris. The observers
of her movements were two detec
tives, who had followed her into the
shop, thinking that they had seen her
before.
The men were correct in their sur
mise, for the matronly person is a
professional thief, with many previous
convictions. She was seen lifting sev
eral articles of cheap Jewelry, and
then walked to another stall, whence
she abstracted .some pieces of velvet
and silk. As she was leaving the shop
the woman was arrested. At the po
lice station she protested that she was
the wrong person and began to cry.
The ostensible baby also cried and the
police superintendent, being evidently
a father, lifted the veil of the in
fant's face and spoke soothing words
to the child.
Looking jnore closely at the baby
the police official noticed that Its eyes
were quite dry and its face bereft of
a trace of life. Tapping the infantine
visage he found that it was made of
cardboard. The bogus baby was a
receptacle for stolen property. On
its body was a contrivance which,
when pressed, made the dummy in
fant evolve cries. The receptacle had
inside it a stolen bracelet and the
pieces of volvet and silk abstracted
from the shop.

SHIRT WAIST SiilT IN SILK-WARP HENRIETTA.
A pretty shade of Dresden blue is used in this smart shirt waist
suit that is plain enough for morning wear and yet dressy enough for
afternoons. The shirt waist has a shallow chemisette of lace, and
the vest of white pique is slit at Intervals, and a plaid silk cravat that
encircles the lace collar is threaded through these slits, the ends fly
ing free above the waist. The shoulder is broad and the sleeve of a
full shii t pattern. A hint of a bolero is given in the arrangement of
the lace on the blouse and the fullness is drawn smoothly into the rib
bon belt. The skirt is in extremely full and rippled gores, close fitting
at the hip and flaring widely at the hem. Lace defines each gore and
a Drincess haircloth is inserted in the hem for a depth of several inches
to sustain the correct flare without undue stiffness.

Commissioner Metson Says Additional
Appropriation Is Needed for
Golden Gate Park.
At the meeting of the Finance Com
mittee of the Board of Supervisors
t day afternooon Commissioner
>n asked for an appropriation in
the budget of $54 8,000 for Golden Gate
Park. As the park is allowed 7 per
cent of the taxes, the charter provi
sion will not yield more than $400,000
this year. It was suggested that a
large sum could be saved the city each
each if a pumping plant were installed
to furnish the large amount of w.iter
consumed and if the United Railroads
could be induced to put on cars to
haul loam to the park. The work is
now done by team at a cost of 75 cents
a cubic yard. Mr. Metson agreed to
bring the matter to the attention of
the Park Commissioners.
Captain Payson, vice president of
the Santa Fe Railroad, asked the com
mittee for an appropriation of $15,000
to help build the bridge at Third street,
leading to the Potrero. The bridge
was originally planned at a cost of
$125,000. but changes have brought
the figure up to $160,000. of which the
Santa Fe is to pay $105,000 and the j
Southern Pacific $55,000. This does j
not include the cost of the approaches j
to the bridge. As the bridge is to be ,
used for traffic by the public as well
as the railroads. Captain Payson i
thought the city should stand the ex
pense of the cost of these approaches,
amounting to $15,000. The matter was
referred to the Board of Public Works. ;
\Y. R. Hewitt of the Department of
Electricity offered an estimate that is
in excess of previous years on account I
of the expansion of the system.
Superintendent Lewis of the Boys'
and Girls' Aid Society asked for an ap
propriation of $9000 for the main
tenance of the Juvenile Detention j
Home. The committee recommended
that $4500 be appropriated for the
home. This includes provision for the
salary of an assistant for the matron.

ON KEARNY. NEAR MARKET
M. H. Do Young Decides to Erect
Sky-ScniFHT for Stores
and Offices.
M. H. de Young haa decided to
build a seventeen-story structure on
the Keurny-street frontage owend by
him. Immediately adjoining the Chron-
Icle building on the north. At one
time it was Intended to make the
structure and the old Chronicle build
ing of equal height, but a seventeen
story building bÂ«ing desired for Kearny
sureet, it was found to be unwise to
bring the Chronicle structure to that
elevation, but one or two stories will
be added. The Kearny-street frontage
owned by Mr. de Young is 6 8 feet.
The lot extends back to the Chronicle
walla. On Kearny street will be stores
on the ground floor, with a large num
ber of offices on the sixteen other
lloore. Bids were opened yosterday
for doing a large part of the work.
Rome minor changes may yet be made
in the plan. General harmony in ex
terior wilj be maintained in the build
ing materials and style of both of the
De Young structures.

MOKE TO FOLLOW SOOX
Great Plant Collection of
California Growth Will
Be an Attractive Feature
The California display at the Port
land Exposition began to move for
ward by rail yesterday. One carload
left this city laden with wines, olives
and olive oil, canned fruits, dried
fruits, nuts and seeds, maps and
school exhibits, some of the articles
that were included in the San Fran
cisco building at SJ. Louis and sundry
other things.
Three carloads of exhibits will be
sent from San Francisco to Portland.
The Sacramento Valley will have two
carloads. Fresno and San Jose will
each forward one, and Southern Cal
ifornia will make a big showing.
Announcement is made that the
people of the Sacramento Valley and
of Alameda County have finally aban
doned the idea of having separate dis
plays in buildings of their own. A
few special exhibits will be placed in
space that has been secured in the
Agricultural building. Nothing will
be shown in the California State
building except as a part of the col
lective display of the State. In the
Agricultural building the California
State Board of Trade will install
fruits, forest and other products.
California plants are -in demand by
the exposition management for the
adornment of the grounds. Two car
loads of plants will be sent from this
city and one carload from LoÂ» Ange
les. Oeorge C. Roeding of Fresno will
probably have charge of the arrange
ment of the plants to secure the best
decorative effect. Golden Gate Park
is largely represented in the plant
collections, which include trees,
shrubbery and flowers.
The building contract calls for the
completion of the California building
on May 1. The latest pictures of the
structure in progress show that the
four wings representative of the arch
itecture of California missions are
about finished. The California com
missioners expect that the building
will be ready for occupancy during
the coming week. The commissioners
and Secretary Dennison will at once
begin work in Portland. Commis
sioner Filcher has been on the expo
sition grounds some weeks. Much of
the exhibit at St. Louis was sent di
rect to Portland.

HISTORY of the STANDARD

taaflEsÃ \j \3 Mp'rl tl e\ rfl*s E
The two great questions to-day before the American people
are:
1. The methods by which monopoly has come to control
production.
2. The methods employed by Mr. Rockefeller personally in
building up the greatest of all American monopolies, the Standard
: Oil Company.
In answer to these questions the American people are demand-
ing, not the vague talk and charges that are filling the air and
papers, but /acts. It is facts' that Miss Tarbell gives them in
her history of the Standard Oil. She alone shows the real bearing
upon monopoly of the railroad rebate, of the control of raw material,
of spying on competition, of underselling to drive a rival from the
market; she alone dissects in every detail the practical working of a
typical Trust, and tells the truth, the whole truth, and nothing
. but the truth about Mr. Rockefeller.

GARFI ELD TALKS
TO COLLEGIANS
Believes Every Man Should
Take an Active Part in
the Politics of Country-
WOELD GETTING BETTER
Common Sense Is Needed to
Keep Citizens From Chas
ing Impossible Ideals
BERKELEY, April 28.â The univer
sity meeting this morning was ad
dressed by James R. Garfleld, son of
former President James A. Garfleld and
commissioner of corporations in the De
partment of Labor and Commerce.
Commissioner Garfleid had been in
vited by President Wheeler to speak
to the student body, and chose as his
subject the necessity of good citizens
taking part in politics and setting up
a high standard of citizenship and po
litical activity. He declared himself
an optimist; that the world is not
growing worse, but better; that there
is no such thing as a dirty pool o-f
politics from which good men should
shrink. His remarks were in part as
follows:
I assure you that it is a pleasure to talk to
you. I have no special message to deliver, but
I know that I can grain inspiration from you
that will help to carry through the work that
has been eivsn to mo to do.
1 wish to say first that I believe the world
Is setting better. The idea o' our forefathers
a century or so ago that men were becoming
worse and worse vvery year I believe to have
been erroneous. A man who announce* to-day
that such a view is faiÃ should take chloro
form. 1 am an ODtlmist of the extreme type.
1 am optimistic because I have found in my
work and in my relations with men that nejtfr
before were the ideals of citizenship and the
etrlvin(fs of men and women on as high a
plane as they are to-day.
It !6 true that some men, some places, come
conditions are bad. That Is natural and not to
be a-voided; but on the whole, viewed broadly,
things are better than they ever were before.
About politics, for instance. There Is no
such thins as that which some call the dirty
pool of politics. No such thing exists except
in the minds of the evil minted. There is
nothing In our Dolitical life that we need be
afraid of, that we need avoid, except the evi
dences of human nature that occasionally take
the form of treachery, which we may there
encounter.
We need three essential characteristics in
our national life. We need courage to do right
and to do rlzht to the bitter end; honesty to
carry out what w* have determined to do, and
an honesty that kills sophistry, a fundamental
honesty that will teach men not to quibble in
matters Of finance or any other matters: and
last of all, we "need common sense, the hard
est of all to acquire, but the most essential
of all. We muÃt have common sense that will
teach us not to chase the Impossible ideals of
our fancy at the foot of the rainbow, but to
deal carefully and rationally with such dan
gers as may confront ua In our national life.
1 think tire first essential of our college
training should be to give us the first prin
ciples of good citizenship. In this should He
the difference between college bred men and
women and those who are not college bred. It
Is not what we learn of the classics and the
sciences or of literature and history that Is
golns to fit us most for the after college
years. It is the inculcation of principles that
stand for the best in lifeâ this Is the most
serious buclneats here. Lastly, keep young
as long as you live, and that will aid you
most in carrying on the business of life.
The remainder of the meeting was
given up to speeches by prominent
members of the senior class. Miss
Ethel Richardson represented the "co
ed" section, as president of the Aboo
ciated Women Students. Other seniors
who spoke were J. P. Loeb, editor of
the Californian, who protested against
"knocking" in college politics; Eugene
Hallett, class president, who discussed
"college comradeship"; Olie Snedigar,
who talked at athletics; W. H. Dehm,
president of the Associated Students;
Leo D. Bishop, editor of the Occident;
D. P. Boothe, A. C. Keane, J. S. Ed
wards and O. S. Orrick.
During the meeting Professor Henry
Morse Stephens announced that Jules
Klein, a senior, had won the James
Bryce historical essay competition. The
winner receives, a prize of $100. It was
also announced that the Bonnheim con
test would take place next year dur
ing November and December and that

FIRST WITNESS IN ROEHN TRIAL.
OAKLAND. April 28.â The first tes
timony' in the trial of Lena Koehn for
the murder of her husband, Edward
Koehn, was adduced before the jury
to-day when Charles Kruger told of
seeing the defendant run from her
house clutching a smoking revolver
in her hand. She proceeded to the
board fence separating the Kruger
and Koehn homes, slipped a loose
board from its place and passed
through and entered the Kruger
home. Fearful that she was intent on
doing harm, Kruger shouted to his
wife to run, but she did not under
stand what he said. Mrs. Koehn was
afterward found in the front room of
their house and she then told them
that she had killed her husband in
self-defense.
Kruger said that it was 9:15 o'clock
Sunday morning, February 12, when
several shots fired in the Koehn house
startled him while he was digging in
his garden, and a minute later he saw
the woman run out of the house.
After hearing her story he consulted
with some of his neighbors and they
summoned a policeman. All went into
the Koehn house and found the vic
tim dead. He was lying partly in a
closet with his feet and legs out of
the door. The hearing of, the case
was not taken up until this afternoon
and after Kruger told his story an
adjournment was taken to Monday
morning.

Charles to-day in the suit of Laumeis
ter vs. Hill, decided that the recent
codification of the town ordinances was
legal; that the ordinances went into
effect upon their passage by the board,
and that a failure to post or publish
the ordinances did not affect their v i
lidity.
Laumeister sued Hill, who is Chief
of Police and acting Poundmaster. for
damages for impounding his horse.
Hill failed to notify Laumeister within
twenty-four hours that the horse had
been taken up and on this ground the
court ordered that Hill pay damages
and costs. The town, the court jaid,
could not be held liable for the failure
of an official to carry out the law.

SAN RAFAEL. April IS. â ThreÂ«
guards were discharged by Warden
Tompkins yesterday. Their dismissal
gave rise to the rumors that they werÂ«
dropped from the rolls because of
their refusal to enter the priaon walls
without arms. Some said that they
were discharged for smugf/Un* opium
into the prison. The Warden refused
to divulge the identity of the dis
charged men. He stated, however,
that they were discharged for in
subordination. It has been learned
that the men discharged were Ben
jamin Merritt. D. E. Wiley and Fred
erick Hall.
Wiley and Hall wÂ«re ordered by the
Warden to subject John Bush, a sec-
ond-termer from San Francisco,
punishment in the straitjacket for
attempting to escape from one of the
incorrigible cells. The guards re!
because the work was distasteful t^>
them, and for their refusal to do it
they were discharged.
Guard Merritt has been on watch
ovor the incorrigibles. The Warden
feit that guards detailed on that watch
should sleep in quarters near the in
corrigible cells, where they could be
within call in the event of an out
break. Merritt is a man of family
and he has been sleeping at his horn*
outside the walls. He refused to takÂ»
his quarters in the prison. The War
den then offered him another post,
but Merritt refused to accept the ne-.v
position and left the prison employ.
The incorrigibles have been particu
larly unruly of iate. "Jack" Ortega.
John Bush, Harry Brown, a con
demned man from Del Norte County.
Harry Hammill. George Hyde, Arthur
Odell Robert Garner and Bert Short
for a time were the disturbing
ment. They shrieked, howled, cursed
and kicked the doors of the cells.
Threats had no effect on them. Finally
the Warden had them transported to
the stone front cells in the yard and
threatened to play the big prison hone
upon them if they did not behave.
This had the desired effect.

CARNEGIE IDEA
SUITS JORDAN
Special DUpAtch to ThÂ« CalL
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Ap
Dr. David Starr Jordan, preside:
the university, has expressed him?
heartily in sympathy with the scheme
of Andrew Carnegie to establish a fund
for the pensioning of old and
college professors in the United States.
To-day President Jordan said:
Our universities recognize that the success
ful professor takes the vow of poverty. What
ever Ins .salary, the demands on him outrun â¢
It, and it he tries to makÂ» money his suc
cess in doing- so Is at the expense of his use
fulness as teacher or investigator. Our uni
versities, moreover, have undertaken more than
they have means to carry out. The demand
for higher education, and especially for pro
fessional training, far exceeds the right pro
vision for It. Hence universities as well a*
professors, whatever their Income, are poor
In tact, the needs of students In every mm
far outrunning the income. â  â¢
Yet most universities wisely managed rec
ognize that It Is economical to treat generous
ly the professor emeritus. To save htm from
worry In event of aid age and other disability
Is to add greatly to his present usefulness. In
making adequate provision for retiring pro
fessors a certainty throughout the country.
Carnegie has done a noble - piece of work for
American education. It will serve to bring
better men Into the profession of higher educa
tion, and will -strengthen the hands of those
now engaged In the work.

of the counties of San Mateo. Santa Clara and

cuss a route for " the Big Basin road .w I U
naturally of very grave interest to the counties
involved. Prominent people, who desire the.

Itself as the easiest to overcome yrade dif-
Acuities. The Inspecting party " proceeded t*
Saratoga summit and from there traced the
proposed route.
â As recommended by these Investigators,
the road would run from Saratoga sum

along * the ridge for many miles where

rests : between ' the . San ' Lorenzo and Boulder
creeks on one side and Fescadero on ; th* other
and extends completely from Saratoga wimmit

THE SHERIDAN ARRIVES FROM MANILA BY WAY OF PORTLAND
The array transport Sheridan, Cap
tain PeaboOy, arhtdi landed the troops
she brought from the Philippines at
Porttar.3. arrived here yesterday from
the On?:ro3 SÂ»Ort She made the run.
frcra ber w tar. in forty hours, which
is gtxxi tlm~ considering the crop of
STÂ«J3S and barrages with which the
submerged part of the transport's huU
is covered.
From water line ur> the Sheiidan is
as clean as â "hen she left this port. Ma

j=l-*rticn or all uts of the ship as
zccxi as sha arrived. He found ev^ery-
QdaS in perfect order and before go
in* ashore went out of his way to ex
press his pleasure with the Sheridan's
appearance. The Sheridan is looked
'J^on as the ir.odel transport, a dis
tinction of which Captain Peabody is
proud. In Chi?i Officer J. X. Ansell
C-apvain Peabody has an executive of
ficer uiter hi^ own heart. Ansell's
specialty" is obeying his superior's or
ders and In ex.ic:unÂ£ obedience from
subordinates. As a result the Sheridan
shines like a yacht and is always ready
for whatever service the Government
may require of her.
About a dozen assorted specimens
of WOK America stowed away on the
transport Buford the last time she left
this port. They were transferred at
Honolulu to the Sheridan, which car
ried them to Portland and there
turned them loose. Twelve hours after
leaving Portland one of Vaese stow
aways, John Wheeler, was discovered
on the Sheridan. He had stowed away
aÂ«a.in. Wheeler Is & little rta>i>_srho
made himself useful on board qu-.Â». v
the run from Honolulu and the Sheri
dan's officers were rather pleased than
otherwise to and him still on board.
His home is in lowa. Without a cent
and with the clothes in which he stood
as his whole wardrobe, Johnny started
out some weeks ago to see the world.
After reaching San Francisco he de
cided to make a tour of the. Orient.
He Flowed away on the Buford and
managed to get as far as Honolulu.
He saw all the sights of the island
port and was disappointed when he
found he would have to return to the
mainland. 'Portland is on de bum "
Is all the explanation he vouchsafed
when asked why he had restored him
self on the Sh-ridan. He says he may
try to take a trip on the Korea, which
â¢ails next Wednesday for the Orient.
He purposes to reach Honolulu and
there stow away on some liner bound
for the Far East. He has accumulated
a little money and a lot of experience.
"And between de two." he confided to
Captain Peabody, "I'll see someting of
de woild before I hits de road back to
lowa_"

rabbits where the park Is now situated, and
could have bought land there by the acre at
a nominal sum. Do you realise - that the
city Is growing very fast, and in a few years
from now will be one of the leading cities of '
the world, and that the lots adjacent ;to our
beautiful Golden Gate Park, will be very â¢
valuable? You are probably aware at what â

over and then look at the block we have Just ,

New York Stock Market.
NEW YORK. April 28.â Effective support
â  to-day â¢ checked the demoralized tone which
threatened the stock market and quieted the
Â£l*culativÂ« excitement, with the result of a
subsidence of activity and a steady tone until
sudden extreme weakness again set In in the
last â¢ tees minutes. Daring the progress of
recovery the average of prices was lifted above
l&ct n.k-ht and some considerable gains were
established, especially In the Northwestern
Yaiiroad croup and In the trunk lines. After
yesterday's* downward plunge there was a feat
that the ...nher prices declined the more pres
eure rhere would be to sell stocks. This ap
. j/rehenjion was sufficiently Justified -by thÂ«
-h*avy liquidation which was caused by thÂ«
unea.slr.ess â¢ throughout the country resulting
.from .fhe h'-avy declines of yesterday. With
XB&rginit materially impaired and the fear of
Â». t\ .: larger losses to be faced the urgent
â¢ elMir* to sell is easily understood. Support
rw attempted at the opening and the more
â  cheerful tone of foreign markets to-day aided
thÂ«. eÂ£Tort. Prices of Americans in London
Here .lifted considerably above last night and
*, t *lÂ»Te *a"s liberal buying tn New J'ork for
; .. Joftsipn account after the trading began, but
â¢thÂ«Â«se gales quickly disappeared .'. under the
t. . â â  o: liquidation which came Into the mar
ket irom all quarters. It was only by the
',moHt .vigorous measures of support that the
l&arkct saved from demoralization again
during the first boar. Enormous' amounts of
\ kt'.'k! passed through the market in that
period in the course of the contest between
V .oppoftng forces. The trading in the first hour
1-. tact made up the bulk of the transactions
â¢ for' the whole day. Thf. chief fear of specu
lative hfcldAj-s evidently was the instability of
the market rather than any actual develop-
Wient* effecting values, and when the sup-,
port had d'-monEtrated its effectiveness- suf
ficient S9FurancÂ« was imparted to dissipate the
urgent desire to sell. There was evidently a
' t large.fh'jrt interest left open also. The failurt
or cenficmation of some erf the alarmist rumor*
wfc^ch circulated yesterday Impressed the sell
er* of, stocks with the Idea that there had
rot been good grounds for their action and
: the disposition to buy. While thÂ«
reelgrnttlon of the head of the Missouri Pacific
, Â«>-Â«.eja from the Union Pacific board was dis
cuesed with seriousness the effect on the mar
y.'-x was lessened by the relative firmness of
Z\ltv "Xiri Pacific end the good support of T*ni(sn !
Pacific. The forecast of the currency move
'Â»roent for the week gave promise of a con
* siderable Increase in the cash holdings of the
[ v t>anks to be shown in to-morrow"* bank state
ment. The market continued to show a ner
â¢ Voui. and uncertain undertone in epite of the
marked failing tt In transactions and there
â¢eerced to be a disinclination on the part of
r the buyer* to follow the advance in prices.
The persistent strength of thÂ« foreign ex
change market, supposed to be due to prepara
. * tlon for remittances of Japanese loan sub
Â« ecrlptlons. -.Â« not liked. Discounts were firm
In London to-day and the price â¢ of sterling
exchange sit Paris declined. â  Next week Is
livable one-half of the subscriptions to the
$100,000,000 of Pennsylvania convertible bonds,
vith the privilege to subscribers to pay in
the full amount. The nervousness of the mar-
Icet was easily seen from the quick response
to the late break In Louisville and Nashville
to 144%. Locomotive . and General Electric
also hÂ»ade disconcerting plunges. in a very
few- minutes most of -the gains melted away
i and the closing was very weak again
Bonds were heavy. Total sales, par value.

a degree of confidence on the buying side* of
i the j wheat market â  that . had : been felt for some
' time oast .'.was. In evidence. ,- A .part of : the
1 bullish â  sentiment was attributed to the â¢ seem
ing Indifference of holders of May, r the volume
; of trading in that .- option being very : light
i throughout the session. ... - Another â  factor , was
; the strength at Minneapolis,- resulting from a
; good' cash demand. Higher prices -at Liver
1 pool formed, a. clincher in decisively estab
*-lishing - the dominance of bullish sentiment.
-On the other hand, weather, conditions were
decidedly unfavorable to a bullish campaign.
Reports by a St. Louis trade paper furnished
encouragement to the bears, the claim, being
made that the yield of winter - wheat this

Deciduous and Citrus Fruits.
Receipts of Chen-tea have been steadily de
creasing for some time, as the crop of the' 1
j Early Purple Guigne variety is almost ex
> hausted and Black Tartarians have not yet
commenced to come forward freely. Yester
day's receipts were only 309 boxes and prices
had a sharp advance. Strawberries, too, were
firmer under decreased receipt*, only 261
chests being received, and one or two brands
of exceptionally fine stock commanded a small
1 premium. Advices from Watsonvllle say that
the receipts of the large varieties from that
region will probably be light for tome days.
as the early crop Is . nearly all gathered, and
it will be. several days before the second Is
ready for market. A -crate of Raspberries,
containing 21 small baskets, came In from Los
Angeles -and sold at 35c per basket, and Black,
berries from Glendora â¢ brought 7%015c - per
basket. Trade In Oranges l and other Citrus
fruits was a little more . active than on the
preceding day. but supplies of all descriptions
were ample and prices showed no Improvement.
In the auction room? eight cars of Navels and
one car of Seedlings were . disposed of. The
Seedlings brought $1&1 15 per box and the
Navels sold as follows: Fancy, $1 10@l 50:
choice, $IÂ©l 25; standards. 7pc@sl 28. Apples
attracted but little attention â â  and there ' were

With Cries of Amazonian

BZrPQtloe Judge A. B. Treadweil
was- a;>oii the brink of annihilation for
a ffw nainutes yesterday. Earl Pat
â¢ iai lady wrestler at the Chutes,
- cied violently in the corridor out
f Judge Kerrigan's court, after
she had been worsted in a case, to get
,mgle hold on Treadweil, shout
nerce battlecry the while. Tread
as as pale as hla natural swarthy
( â omplexion would permit and his re
&f unbounded when a corps of
~s finally persuaded the lady Her-
pules to abandon her purpose.
c "Whew, it looked like curtains for me
for a few minutes." said Treadweil
after the fair exponent of Jiu Jitsu lum
bered down the corridor waving her
arms threateningly. "I've seen her
'rastle with that other fat woman at
the Chutes, and Earl generally throws
the other one clear to the rafters.
And she's there with the wallop, too.
Ciose.call for the Judge. Guess yes."
,' â¢ Carl's anger arose over the action
of Judge Treadwell as counsel for
Frank Sanchez, contesting Earl's ac
' count as guardian of the estate of
young' Sanchez. Treadwell was rein
forced by Josephine Sanchez, Frank's
dieter, and between them they explain
ed' that Earl's account was unfair, as
It called for $360 of Frank's *430 estate,
"and," they declared, "Earl has done
â¢othlng on earth to entitle her to this
money. "Why even the fees were re
. mitted" by order of court and . how on
.earth she comes to be entitled to $360
"w* can't Bee."
â¢V' The court said he would consider
â the matter carefully and then the Am
**onlan Earl. Judge Treadwell and
?;Hiss Sanchez walked out into the cor
ridor, where Earl's wrath broke.
% "I think I've seen that mug on the
bench," said Earl glaring at Tread
well. "How in did you ever get
elected a Judge. You're the biggest
iiar I ever saw on earth."
Bo speaking crossly she assumed a
wrestler's crouch and made for the
Judge. Treadweil sidestepped and
round and round they went. Earl
shouting aloud the most shocking
opinion she held of the lawyer that
"dered oppose her account. Then Miss
Sanchez joined in and the two women
engaged in a desperate wordy battle.
>â¢ Finally a sufficient number of bailiffs
' arrived to render safe an effort to calm
Earl, th*> fat lady wrestler, and after
surveying the forces arrayed against
hr r she decided to go in peace.
Treadwell says he Is willing to make
a* l>ook that if Earl should carry her
temper with her to the Chutes she
would throw her wrestling partner
through the roof at the first meeting.
It's a good bet to take, for Earl's

WIFE PROVOKES ARREST
BUT SPOUSE IS "RUN IN"
Saucily Addresses a Patrolman as "Kid"
Unhappy End of Wedding Anniversary
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
Samuel Smead and his wife had been
celebrating the fifteenth anniversary
of their wedding day and were in hi
larious spirit when they ran afoul of
the law as personified by Patrolman
Small. While they were passing by
the officer on Minna street, between
Fifth and Sixth, and he was merely
subjecting them to casual glance, the
woman smiled saucily at him and mut
tered several words, of which "kid"
alone was Intelligible. But the tone of
the utterance sufficed to satisfy him
that it was Intended to tease, if not
offend, and as his relationship to its
author was that of a perfect stranger
he considered her not entitled to the
privilege of either "guying" or insult
ing him. So he rebuked her unwar
ranted freedom by telling her, among
other things, that she would better re
frain from a repetition of her pitiful
endeavor to be funny. To this she re
torted by screwing her face into a grin
denoting contempt, but her husband
went to greater length in the line of
provoking exasperation by shaking a
fist at the uniformed mentor. Then
they were sharply commanded to move
on and their response was a mutual
dead halt and further demonstrations
of defiance, including facile distor
tion.
"I arrested the man," said the of
ficer to Police Judge Mogan. "be
cause if it hadn't been for his restraint
the woman, I think, would have moved
on."
"But the woman started the provo
cation." saJd his Honor, "and there
fore was more to blame than the man.
For that reason 1 am inclined to deal
leniently with him. Besides, fifteenth
anniversaries of weddings are not of
everyday occurrence and their cele
brants are entitled to a little excep
tional leeway in the matter of p^ace
disturbance. I will dismiss this case
and advise Mr. and Mrs. Smead to
spend their sixteenth wedding day at
home."
Miss Violet Arthur, actress, was
wearing a duck of an Easter hat in a
Maeon street cafe when Miss Augusta
A. Bragg, milliner in the Starr King
block, saw the headgear and thought
she recognized it as one of her own
creations which had been stolen. Miss
Arthur, however, indignantly asserted
that the hat had never been in Miss
Bragg's possession, whereupon Miss
Bragg instituted search warrant pro
ceeding* for its recovery- While the
case was pending Miss Arthur, accom
panied by her brother and an attor
ney, visited Miss Bragg's establish
ment, displayed a hat and asked if it
â was the one alleged to have been pur
loined. Miss Bragg, after closely ex
amining the exhibit, answered ln the
negative^ saying that while it very
much resembled her missing property
it lacked certain distinguishing marks
which would serve to prove identifica
tion beyond doubt. "Then," Miss Ar
thur triumphantly exclaimed, "that's
the hat I wore ln the restaurant and
which you claimed as yours." Exit
with hat.
When the case was called before
Judge Cabaniss there was no appear
ance of the complainant, but Miss Ar
thur was not satisfied to rest even
undwr the shadow ut a suspicion that
her hat was stolen, so she induced
the court to immediately issue an or
der compelling Miss Bragg's attend
ance When the milliner did appear
she clung to her original averment
that the hat worn by Miss Arthur in
the restaurant was the stolen hat and
that the hat subsequently displayed
by Miss Arthur was a close counter
part of the stolen hat. The case is
under Judicial advisement
Patrolman John S. P. Deane stood
astounded when Judge Conlan, after
consulting the charter, informed him
that he was not a policeman at all and
therefore could not have been bribed as
a policeman by a Bacon place woman
, whom he had systematically inveigled
Into giving him $3 1n return for his
promise that she would be "protected."
He was mustered out of the army in
i 1902 and had not lived in San Fran
cisco the requisite five years preceding
his appointment to tne police force.
In October of last year he was appoint
ed a policeman from the civil service
list two months later he took the
money from the -woman and gave it to
Police Commissioner Hutton to be used
1 as evidence that police corruption was
raging in the underworld, and last
week, becoming tired of the Grand
Jury's inaction in the case and his own
exclusion from the limelight, he ar
1 rested the woman on his own initiative
! and charged her with bribe-giving.
!It was Attorney Arthur Mack who
1 proved his officialism illegal.
"Technically." said the Judge to the
i o'er-realous complainant, "you are not
j a police officer, and your appointment
* as one was either a result of rank im
â  position or a queer mistake. However,
! I will give you until next Monday to
produce proofs that you were legally
appointed."
â When the crestfallen Mr. Deane left
; the courtroom he was greeted with de
risive grunts by a number of sure
enough policemen ln plain clothes who
; were awaiting summons to testify in
[ cases of their own. He hastened back
to the tribunal and, after remaining
, there several minutes, again ventured
â¢ forth, and with head erect, ran the
I gauntlet of a staring lobby.
Police Captain Duke Informed Judge
i Mogan that Myrtle Howard, arrested
for vagrancy by Patrolman Alpers, was
i apparently a victim of persecution be
; cause she had testified against Patrol
: man Felix Dougherty, who was fined
j $50 by the Commissioners for having
1 been her companion in various saloons.
1 It was only by assuring the woman of
I nrotectlon from Dolice reDrlsaL the
THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL', SATURDAY, APRIL 29, 1905.
captain said, that he persuaded her to
testify, and he considered her arrest
by Alpers an act of. unjust discrimina
tion, as she was no more a vagrant
than were hundreds of other fallen wo
men who were not interfered with.
"I arrested her on complaint of a
citizen whom she accosted on the
street." said the patrolman.
"Why didn't you tell me that be
fore?" inquired the captain.
"Because I preferred to reserve my
evidence for the court," was the reply.
The patrolman was given until May
3 to make good his plea, that no dis
crimination was intended.
William Coding, an octogenarian, ef
fected his third escape from the
County Almshouse and was arrested
while begging on Montgomery street.
"I'd rather be in Jail than In the
poorhouse," he told Judge Mogan, "be
cause it's so windy out there that
there's no such thing as* comfortable
living."
To jail he was sent for three months.
"But, Jedge, Ah doan think Ah kin
raise de cash," despairingly wailed
Henry Burton when Judge Cabaniss
had fined him $5 for drunkenness in a
public place.
"Make an effort. Henry, make an ef
fort," implored his Honor, "for there
is a recently discovered hole ln the
municipal treasury that needs filling.
Indeed I might say that the city needs
all the money it can get."
But Henry went to Jail.

Judge Fritz evidently was thinking
of something else than the case in
hand when he glanced abstractedly at
the defendant and instructed Bailiff
Conlon to summon the Russian inter
preter. The officer's hesitancy and the
defendant's grin brought his Honor's
mind to a focus. He looked at the cal
endar, then at the defendant, then ex
claimed, "Mike Walsh? Why, you're
not a Russian." Mr. Walsh promptly
replied: "Naw; I'm from the County
Mayo, as Officer Fo4ey can tell ye, for
many an' many's th' time I've played
handball wid him."
Yet the Judge's absent-minded haz
ard was not such a wild one. Long
and unkempt hair of fiery hue covered
Mr. Walsh's skull and all except a very
small area of hiÂ» face, and his eyes
gleamed savagel^ from amid their
bushy environment. His garb, too, was
picturesquely tattered.
Patrolman E. C. Bable arrested
Walsh for begging on Hayes street,
near St. Ignatius Church, and physical
disability was the defensive plea.
"You don't mean to say you're an
invalid?" the Judge asKed, surveying
the man's brawny make-up.
"Consumptive," was the gasping re
sponse.
"Perhaps if you'd remove some o-f
that hair you might feel stronger," re
marked his Honor.
"You ye sot that idea all mixed up,"
saiÂ« Mr. Walsh, smiling through his
whiskers, "it was the loss of his hair
that weakened Samson."
"But shearing might have a directly
contrary effect upon you. The experi
ment is worth trying anyway. When
you have served a thirty days' sen
tence we'll know how the hair-cutting
remedy for consumption has worked.
You'll fall under the hands of the
prison barber this afternoon."
Volney E. Davis, a decent appear
ing young fellow, saw a maiden on
Third street whom he Imagined he
knew, but her scornful response to his
cordial greeting satisfied him that it
was a case of mistaken identity. A
moment later he wae accosted by a
sturdy youth with demand for infor
mation as to what he meant by an
noying his (the sturdy one's) sister,
and when the error was explained and
a supplemental invitation to drink
had been accepted the twain adjourn
ed to a saloon, where the putative
brother of the scornful maiden had no
sooner absorbed the beverage than he
resumed hostile demeanor and punch
ed Volney's Jaw. Volney retreated to
the street, pursued by hie assailant,
who enlisted several able-bodied young
men to assist him in administering
further punishment. 'Twas then Vol
ney drew from his pocket a knife with
which to defend himself, and while he
brandished the weapon a policeman
took him in. Judge Fritz dismissed
the case after Volney had narrated the
foregoing version of the incident.

"I drink only when I eat," said Mrs.
Nellie McNeeve, arrested for drunken
ness upon the apex of Bernal Heights.
"But you eat too often." said Judge
Mogan. "for these records show that
you are an old offender in the line of
inebriety. Six months."

JOSEPH KNIGHT
WANTS ALIMONY
Asks That His Wife, Who Is
Seeking Divorce, Maintain
Him Pending a Decision
SHE HAS FIVE CHILDREN
Says Her Entire Income Is
Necessary to Care for
Little Ones and Herself
Joseph Knight wants Ills wife. Ade
laide, who Is suing him for divorce, to
pay him alimony pendentc lite.
Astonishment was plainly written on
Judce Rerrifiran's face yesterday when
Knight took the stand and testified
that though he Is strong and able to
make a living as a mattress-maker, he
would prefer that his wife allow him
a portion of the income of her little
furniture store at 698 Valencia street.
The wife, who Is 52 years of aÂ«te,
supports herself and live children on
what she says Is an income just large
enough to keep them from want.
Mrs. Knight was present in court
with her five children and after both
sides had told their stories the court
took Knight's application under ad
visement.
"He is able to care for himself better
than I am." said Mrs. Knight, "for I
am getting old, being 52 years of age,
and must rear and euueate my chil
dren. If he wanted to he could work
and care for himself and not take
from me what 1 need for my children
and myself."
A decree of divorce was granted yes
terday to Isabella H. Benson from
Frank V. Benson for desertion. Suits
for civorce were filed by Marguerite
Lowe against James Lowe for failure
to provide; Joseph Wewerka against
Kowena Wewerka tor cruelty; James
B. McSheehy against Catherine Mc-
Sheehy for habitual intemperance, and
Lizzie Ruiz against Joseph B. Ruiz
for cruelty and infidelity. Mr. and Mrs.
Ruiz own a half interest in the Tivoli
Concert Hall ln Stockton; also a half
interest in four racehorses, known on
the track as Wilstaria, Sterling Tow
ers, Constable and Endina. This prop
erty. Mrs. Ruiz alleges, is worth $45,000,
one-half of which she is entitled to.
Lizzie M. Lapsley asks that her mar
riage to George E. Lapsley be annulled
on statutory grounds. Llllle V. El
dred says that but four months elapsed
between the time she became the wife
of Roland J. Eldred and the decree of
divorce separating him from Lillian V.
Biehermann and that hence she does
not believe she is the legal wife of
Lapsley, owing to the interlocutory de
cree law. '
Ella M. Duncan has sued her hus
band, George W. Duncan, for main

husband deserted her on March 5 and
that notwithstanding the fact that he
is in receipt of a monthly income of
$130 as an employe of a tobacco firm
at 973 Broadway, Oakland, he refuses
to support her. Marguerite Lathrope
asks that her husband, Robert Lath
rope, be compelled to maintain her.
She gays he deserted her five weeks ago
and since then has given her no funds.
Will Examine Escapes.
Secretary Louis Levy of the Board
of PublW: Works has directed inspec
tors of the bureau of buildings to ex
amine the fire escapes' of the various
buildings in this city, with a view of
discovering whether they have been
weakened by corrosion. It appears
that the Fire Department has called
attention to the fact that the salt air
has had a tendency to rust the fire
escapes, and, at the suggestion of the
Chief of the Fire Department, the
Board of Public Works recommended
to the Supervisors that they amend the
ordinance and force all owners of
buildings on which there are fire
escapes to galvanize the same. The
ordinance is to be enforced by the
Board of Public Works and the Fire
Wardens of the city intend to co
operate with that department.

DEFEATS PLAN
OF POLITICIANS
Suit to Oust Trustees of
Library Unceremoniously
Thrown Out by Hebbard
COURT SPEAKS PLAINLY
Says Purpose of Injunction
Proceedings Is Sinister
and Sustains Demurrer
The action instituted by Thomas W.
O'Dowd and Martin O'Conor to oust
the board of trustees of the Free Pub
lic Library from office was uncere
moniously thrown out of court by
Judge Hebbard yesterday morning.
The court wrote an exhaustive opin
ion explaining in detail the impossible
position taken by Attorney Daniel
O'Connell to secure the relief sought,
but O'Connell was not convinced of the
error of his position and announced
that he would take the case to the Su
premo Court. That Judge Hebbard
looked upon the suit as naught but a
political scheme is made plain by the
language of his decision. In part he
says:
Beyond any doubt plaintiffs seek alone to
have the office of thÂ« trustees of this library
declared vacant, for there is no other possible
reason visible ln the oomplaint. They claim
that the charter of this city and county, un
der which thÂ« Trustee* hold office, to wit, arti
cle 2, section 1, chapter 7, Is unconstitutional.
They claim that Injunction is the proper reme
dy, and that the question of title to office Is
only incidentally Involved, and counsel for the
plaintiffs pins his faith to tne case of Morton
vs. Broderick In 118 California, careful reading
of which swiftly and surely denies him the re
lief he asks herein.
The present U>ard Is acting within the limits
of its authority and its duty; no Imputation of
fraud or dishonesty or Impropriety Is given to
the demands, and the Auditor is doing only
his lawful duty In allowing them. The de
murrer Is sustained without leave to plaintiff
to amend, and tbÂ« action is ordered dismissed
with judgment to defendants for their costs.
The court further held that as title
to the office was the only question In
volved quo warranto proceedings alone
would lie.

CROOK WANTED
IN SAN JOSE
The two men arrested by Policeman
Tillman on Third street early Thurs
day morning who gave the names of
George Baker id Fred Stevenson have
been identified as ex-convicts. The
former will be taken to San Jose, where
he is wanted on a charge of robbery.
Baker is J. B. Clifton, who was re
cently discharged from Folsom Peni
tentiary after serving a ten-year term
for burglary ln Los Angeles. Stevenson
is James Bassett. who has served two
terms for burglary, the last being a
term of seven years from San Jose.
Clifton has been identified as one of
the two masked footpads who entered
the Fredericksburg saloon em the Ala
meda road. San Jose, on the night of
April 10, and held up the bartender and
six customers. Their plunder consisted
of $80 in coin, a gold watch and a dia
mond ring. Clifton had a 41-caliber
Colt's revolver at the time and the
same revolver was found upon him
when arrested by Tillman.
Deputy Sheriff Dreischmeyer of San
Jose arrived in the city yesterday and
will take Clifton back with him this
morning. He thinks Bassett was Clif
ton's companion in the hold-up, but so
far there is nothing definite to fix the
crime upon him. The deputy says
there v.as also a third man who kept
guard outside the saloon.
Detectives Bunner and Matheson had
beten searching for Clifton and Bassett.
aÂ« they were thought to have been im
plicated In the hold-ups in saloons
here, also ln a burglary. The victims
had a look at them In the City Prison,
but although they answered the de
scriptions of the robbers they
would not swear to their identity from
the fact that they had worn masks.
Bassett will be detained here pending
further developments.
L NCLEAXIJNESS IS CAUSE

James Dooley Fails to Appear Before

Made Against Him.
The Fire Commissioners yesterday
dismissed James Dooley, tlllerman of
Truck 8, from the department. Dooley
was found guilty of neglect of duty
and it was also alleged that he was
filthy personally. Dooley failed to ap

A complaint was read from George
B. Evans, secretary of the District
Council of Painters, asking the com
mission to prevent firemen from do
ing painting jobs around their respec
tive flrehouses. The matter was re
ferred to Chief Sullivan. The Chief
reported that fifty-one second alarm
box calls had been taken otf Truck
Company 10, six second alarm calls
off Truck Company 1 and two oft
Truck Company 2. The changes were
approved by the board.
Bids have been invited for the con
struction of two or more second-sized
steam flre engines, to be paid out of
the appropriation for the ensuing fiscal
year. John Kenney was granted a
leave of absence for thirty days. A
written examination of hosemen will
take place to-day at the Girls' High
School.
MEETS WITH UNEXPECTED
RECEPTION FROM FIANCEE
H. J. Dupnls Swears Out Warrant for
the Arrest of J. C. Collins
for Battery.
H. J. Dupuis ha* been engaged for
some months to a young woman living
at 766 Howard street and ln the hope
that she would soon become his wife
he has been giving her all of hi* earn
ings except his actual living expenses
as a fund to purchase furniture and
other effects. He has discovered that
he has a rival and yesterday he swore
out a warrant in Police Judge Fritz's
court for the arrest of J. C. Collins on
a charge of battery.
He told the Judge that he called
upon the young woman on Thursday
night, intending to give her a few more
dollars. When he knocked on the
door of her room there was no re
sponse. He knocked a second time
and the lights were extinguished. The
door was opened and a voice said,
"Oh. it's you; come In." Just then
he received a blow on the face from
a man's fist. It knocked him down
and necessitated a call at the Central
Emergency Hospital. He says he rec
ognized Collins as the man who
knocked him down. He refused to
give the name of the young woman.
