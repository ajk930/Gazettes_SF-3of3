should be serered.' The matter wat duly

by him to the advisory board. The advisory
board found no reason tor offering any objec-'

As soon as , Dr. c Goebel' s . discharge ; was
\u25a0 made known to-day \u25a0 an i effort was : made
to interview him and get his side of , the
story, but he wâ â¢ not. to be found:. at
his residence in Palo Alto, and his where
abouts would not be disclosed by members
of his household. All questions relating
to the case were referred to William Den
man, \u25a0an attorney in San Francisco 'in
â¢whose hands Dr. Goebel hae placed his
Interests. It is understo>. that he has
threatened suit upon several members of
the Stanford faculty and it'may be pos
sible that he was conferring with his
lawyer to-day looking toward some action
of. this kind. .

The President also authorfzed the
"statement that no other cKangefn'th'o

To all except President Roosevelt's
closest advisers the announcement of
the Selection of Bonaparte as the head
of the navy came as a surprise, al-'.'

_by the President for some time in an

â¢ail the gossip Bonaparte has not been :

For many j'cars Bonaparte has been
an Intimate friend of the President. , So..
great is Mr. Hoosevelt's confidence In
,him that on many matters of national.
concern he has sought his advice an!
â¢counsel. To determine accurately the:
legal phases of the postal frauds" â¢ the
3'resident designated Bonaparte ?: and
Holmes Conrad to investigate, and on
their report he took ..decisive action
without hesitation. .'-â¢ .. /
Eminent as a. lawyer and a publicist
and a consistent advocate of civil ser-Â°
vice reform. Air. Bonaparte has not
L<cn supposed 'to have had more than
an academic interest in' the~ navy. In
the upbuilding- of -the navy". . however,
he is kno\jrn; to-beiin perfect- accord

CLAMOR AGAINST AUTOCRACY
Various rumors are afloat, all agreeing
that a continuance of the. war was the
first question taken up, whereupon the
peace party offered a strong line of argu
ment, which was supplemented, it is said,
by a dispatch from Lieutenant General
LJnevitch, in which that commander ex
pressed a fear. as to the demoralizing
effect of the naval disaster on the army,
the news of which had already reached
the troops from Vladivostok and* was
rapidly spreading.
Though the city, is tranquil. Governor
General Trepoff is continuing his pre
cautionary measures. Two further- Don-
Cossack regiments have arrived and the
police and reserves are held on duty.- Dur
ing the night small patrols were seen/ on;
the Nevsky Prospect and other streets.;,
Alarmist rumors are atloat as to- the';
disaffection ' among .the sailors quartered
here and the workmen are again mutter
ing about a general strike. â¢ . ; â¢
Persistent but unconfirmed \u25a0 rumors are
in circulation to the effect, that the pro
tected cruiser Jemtchug has' arrived at
Vladivostok^and private messages from
that vessel are said to have, been received
by the relatives her officers here, but
the Admiralty does -not yet include' her in

war will be the result of yesterday's im
portant conference between the Empwror
and his Ministers at Tsarskce-Selo hangs
in doubt, the AaJnlsters who returned to
St. Petersburg" late at night preserving
a cautious reticence over the proceedings
of the council as far as the attitude, of
thfe Emperor is concerned. Prince Obel
ensky, who had an audience yesterday
with his Majesty, found him resolutely
determined on the^prosecutlon or ihe war.
"Though the = war be long, we hope that
you will be loyal and brave and secure a
successful result."
To the navy the Emperor issued the
following rescript:
"Our navy, with the best strategy and
greatest courage, "annihilated the, enemy's
squadron and answered our "hope. We
appreciate deeply your splendid success."
Admiral Togo reports that, as the two
Russian hospital ships which accom
panied Admiral Rojestvensky's fleet into
the straits of Korea on May 27 were sus
pected of a violation of The Hague con
vention, arid also because of the greatest
necessity for strategetic protection, he de
tast.ed them temporarily and convoyed
them to Sisebo on May 2S.
The .damages to the Japanese fleet,, Ad
msrai iEr:go:sa.ysÂ»,werfc t-isht.. Only three
to!pcds~"b'ja"ts' were" "lost. No warship or
destroyers were sunk. About 200 men
were lost. /
The Emperor has issued the following
rcschpt to Admiral Togo:
"Our combined fleet encountered . the
enemy's licet in the Korean Straits and
after several desperate battles annihilated
it/ accomplishing an unprecedentel feat.
*"YVÂ» are glad that by the loyalty of
our officers and men we have been en
abled to" respond to the spirits of our
ancestors.
Russian Admiral Voelkersam is sup
posed to ha-ve perished during: the battle-
Admiral Togo reports that all the .cap
tured ships sent to Sasebo have arrived
and their crews have been landed. Ad
miral Rojestvensky has entered the naval
hospital. The report o that Vice Admiral
Enquist was, captured proves to have
been a mistake, caused by the misinter
pretation wireless telegrams. ,
TOKIO, May 3Lâ Admiral Togo has tele
graphed as follows:
"The naval battle, fought from the af
ternoon of May 27 to May 2S in the vicin
ity of Okino Island and extending: to the
vicinity of Urleung Island, is called the
naval battle of the sea of Japan."
The Russian prisoners, Togo says, will
exceed 3000 in number.

later called into extraordinary council Admiral Alexieff and all of his 'Ministers, of State anil a'series of conferences took place as to the course to.be pursued. _Itis;believed ; that the Emperor is determined on a prosecution
of the war. The Russian press", with few exceptions, is openly indignant 'andis^attackingthe bureaucracy, onepaper saying that "those guilty for "-"the defeat should be overwhelmed with shame." Throughout the
empire the -cause of the Liberals' has been given impetus by. the Japanese triumph and it is certain that the Gzar,will be forced to hasten reforms ; to, stilk public, clamor. _ \u0084 --, c

EVIDENCT3 OF STOMARINBiS.
The repair ship Kamtchatka was badly
hit early in the battle. Her steering gear
was so disabled that she could only , cir
cle around and around. While In this
condition a shell hit her engines; com
pletely, disabling her. Fifty-six of " her
Kamlmura, however, allowed the' Ru
ssia ns to pass him. - Then Rear Admiral
Uriu broke upon them from Okl Isl
and and passed across the head of the
third line, raking them again and again.
Japanese submarine boats, the corre
spondent says., proved . most effective.
The armored cruiser Vladimir Mpnomach
hoisted the white flag during the ' battlef
and with 100 of her crew surrendered. .
\u25a0 Other accounts of the battle describe
the roar of the cannon as so terrible
that houses were shaken at Yamagucht.
twenty-eight miles distant, and the
people supposed it was an earthquake.
The Japanese fleet suffered little. The
battleship Ashal was often hit and suf
fered the heaviest losses, but did not
quit the firing line; Admiral Kaml
mura has been sent southward. . " â¢ , "-
"In the engagement fought off Lian
co'urt Rock the Russian' battleships
were surrounded by Japanese ships,
which circled about them, pouring In a
terrible flre, and they almost Immedi

Ing their plight. Vice Admiral Togo
signaled from the battleship Mlkasa a
demand to know whether the Russians
were ready to surrender. Our ships
complied â¢with the demand." .' r

SANTA ROSA. May 31.â A decision of
importance to the public school teach
ers of the entire State has been ren
dered by Superior Judge Albert G. Bur
nett. The decision was given In * the
case of James Ferguson, a former prin
cipal of the Petaluma High School, In
the suit which he instituted against the
Sonoma County Board of Education to
compel the board to restore to him his
certificate, which he claims was unlaw
fully -and unjustly suspended.
The certificate of Principal : Ferguson
was indefinitely suspended by the So
noma "County Board .of Education on
July 9. 1904. for alleged "unprofessional
conduct . and evident unfitness for
teaching." In his petition for a writ
of mandate to compel the restoration
of his certificate as a teacher. Princl-.
pal , Ferguson alleged that the.certia
cate was taken from him "in a high
handed and arbitrary manner," with
out a ,- sufficient .notice, without a trial
and without due process, of the law.
The question Involved ,in the case
which made it of such vital Importance
to the teachers of the State was wheth
er or not a teacher's certificate, en
titling him to teach and thereby earn
his livelihood, can be arbitrarily taken
from him without any trial.
In presenting the case to the court
Attorney Stephen V. Costello, who ap
peared in behalf of Ferguson, contend
ed that - the constitutions of the State
of California and of the United States
accord to every citizen the right to fol
low whatever lawful calling he may se
lect. He further argued that the ac
tion, of 'the Sonoma County Board of
Education in suspending Ferguson's
certificate was In direct violation, of
this provision of the constitution,
which provides that no person shall be
deprived >of his liberty without due
process, of the law. liberty In this re
spect meaning right to pursue a lawful
calling.
District Attorney Pond, who repre
sented the Board of Education, argued
that the board had arbitrary power in
the matter and could suspend a teach
er's certificate without any previous
notice of trial. He based his argu
ment wholly on the decision of the Su
preme Court in the Carter case, where
it was held that the Mayor of San Di
ego had arbitrary power to dismiss a
municipal officer whom he had ap
pointed. . â¢
Judge Burnett held with Attorney
Costello that the doctrine laid down in
the Carter case did , not apply and that
there was a vast difference between
the rights of a school teacher who had
spent years of hhi life to Qualify him
self to teach and a â¢ public officer .; who
had received his, office by appointment.

Judge CoSey, while be does not ex
press approval -<of the charges In form,
rules with Ciunie : and holds that Judge
Bridgford has illegally taken $2309 from
the estate, under the plea that it would
be due hun as executor's fees when he
has discharged his trust, and also holds
that the employment of Hudson Grant
txA VTalter Robinson as. attorneys, for
which Grant was paid (SOOO and Robinson
52DM, without an order cf court, was
contrary to the terras of the wHI of the
deceased. As a result Judge CoSey cut
the allowance of the attorneys from $10,
009 "en account" to $5000, which fee is not
"en account." but. says the court. Is In
full compensation <\u25a0 for all -services up to
and including final distribution.
"The court." says Judge Coffey. "Is not
disposed to hold the accounting executors
guilty cf *an attempt to deceive* In re
gard to the premature payment on ac
count of commissions. It Is sufficient to
say that executors or administrators have
&o right to \u25a0anticipate the allowance of
commissions, or to draw in advance the
whole or any part thereof; bu.. such acts
have been committed occasionally by
lawyers acting as' executors, as . well as
by laymen, under a misapprehension of
the law. This may be a question of In
terest on the settlement of the final ac
count; for the present It is passed with
out further remark.**

Is Through With Him, but Does
. â¢ Not^Wish to Prosecute.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD
"He was my steady," whispered Miss
Eleanor Brady of 204 Ellis street to Po
.lice Judge Mogan after she had told how
TYed Spaulding, real estate dealer at' 4s
Stockton street, had \u25a0 battered her head
while she was visiting his office. - >
"But even the . relationship , you ; aver
would not Justify bis raising of hands in
curred on Memorial day, and the array of
bruised skulls and faces in .each of the
Police Court . departments spoke -volumes
for the faithfulness with which .the decor
ative phase of â¢ the holiday- was ; observed
in San Francisco, even If it 'did not reflect
the solemnity of observance ;^ which", tho
city's dub women ao' earnestly, advocated.
Patrolman Louis H. Meyer was in
plain -attire, oft duty and on pleasure
solely bent when.^he; went to Harbor
View. Park and mingled with; the mer-'
ry-making I crowd thither, attracted; on
Decoration day, and *he was acting as
a peacemaker and'not-as'aipollceof
flcer when he ' received f the * blow : that
necessitated: his | visit: to j hospital after.
he had arrested and booked its authors.
the i Signori ; Henry Pocai and Alfred
Bergman. Three stitches were required
to close the gash! over his : left -eye.- -
After enjoying a. hot salt water bath
Patrolman ? Meyer and ;\u25a0_ Dentist
ing were' sauntering; about and envy
ing' the /whole-souled \u25a0 way in r which an
Italian party <of I picnickers were ; ban
ishing grim; workaday "cares. : -"
, "Isn't it a beautiful thing," said the
dentist, ','to see how, these light-heart
ed children of Italia absorb the spirit
of our national holidays? Here '.we : ob
serve \u25a0 them disporting, themselvesywlth
the innocent enthusiasm that marks
the carnival time in their native ; land.'',
"With not an angry word ; from . one
of them," acquiesced the" policeman."
"They drink their dago - red j and .' eat
their macaroni sandwiches and " dance
and laugh and - gambol - with ; all , the
abandon of- school -children .- .-.at play.

It was the abrupt breaking, out of
riot among the subjects of ; discussion
that both interrupted : and belied .the
officer's glowing tribute. . Fists swung,
picnic utensils were hurled and strange
oaths and' shrill screams rent the *,at
mosphere that a moment before had
been freighted with Joyous shouts and
explosions of \u25a0 hearty laughter. So

MAINE ASSOCIATION
TO HOLD REUNION
OAKLAND. May 31. â Family quarrels j
are responsible for the suicide to-day
of Mrs. Agnes Brown at Ashland, near
Haywards, and the almost successful J
attempt at self-destruction of Mrs. 1
Chauncey Morse of Pleasamon- In]
both cases the troubles 'were engender- |
ed by reason of objections on the part"!
of the mothers to their daughters' ac-*l
tiens.' i
Mrs. Brown IsÂ°the wife of a \vell-to- ;
do . farmer who has 'resided for. many <
years at Ashland. For fuse time she j
had' been at outs with her daughter, :
and to -day their dispute's culminated in j
s. eerious family quarrel. Shortly after j
the dutbre&k, Mre^ Brown went to the j
kitchen pantry, wfcere she spread a lot
of strychnine on come crackers and ate j
them. In a f exr * minutes j she was in j
fatal convulsions. Dr. Reynolds was j
called from Haj~wards. but could be of j
no service. Mrs. Brown was 5S years '
old, a native of the Azpres Islands. The j
coroner took ch'argre* of the case.
Mrs. Morse took,, carbolic acid Sun- j
day. She lies In a critical condition at i
the residence In Plcasanton of Mrs. J. J
A Philpot, and is under care of Dr. *
B. J. V."c!ls. She is the wife of Chauncey j
Morse, a butcher. Sunday morning the
Alorses made serious objection to the S
company kept by their daughter. Miss";
Pearl iJorse, eighteen years old. The ;
quarrel led the girl to leave home. Her '.
failure to return led- thÂ«e mother to fear j
ehe had unduly upbraided her daughter. \
In her despocd eat. frame o* mind she i
took the poison. . Mrs. Morse trent to
the Philpot home 'and disclosed her con,
dition. Physicians were summoned aad \
saved-her life. The daughter, learning |
of^ what had occurred, rushed to her
mother's bedside, I where the two were
reconciled.

Captain Holford refused - even to eatery

It was at the King's request that Cap
tain Holford consented- to hand* ' Do
rchester House over to Reid and his fao
ily. He would never have agreed te da
it otherwise. In speculating en f t&e '
probable London* residence of the* new
American Embassador, J orcbester House
was frequently mentioned in society jour
nals as the most suitable mansion for' his
purpose that . could be found [In London,
but always that statement was coupled
with : expressions of regret that such an
arrangement was impossible, owing.* to '
Captain Holf ortfs aversion to letting . It.
A few. weeks ago one paper announced \u25a0
that* Reid ; had secured, a leaae of Jthe
house, but that .was before the matter^
had been â¢ settled . and \u25a0a - score o* other ,
journals contradicted â¢ the statement and
ridiculed the idea. It- was -soon after
that that his Majesty gave Captain-Hol
ford the hint tnat has secured /for; the
American Embassador what is acknowl

In London. .- .. - -r

Rockefeller has made a gift of high
value to humanity in revolutionizing
business methods and affirms that,
while some men have been crowded- to
the wall in the movements of the
Standard Oil Conipany, every competi
tor was urged to join it on fair and
equal terms.
Rev. Dr. McArthur declares that the
critics of Rockefeller appeal to the
passions of the .unthinking multitude
and that this is assassination of char
acter. He "repels indignantly" the
c&arge that the Baptist denomination
has solicited money from a man -whoso
wealth has been dishonestly acquired,
points out that T)r. William J. Tucker,
president of Dartmouth College, should
not be branded as a criminal because
Dartmouth owned stock In the Norths

tion that Rockefeller is worth a billion
dollars is grossly false and that in the
last two or three years his benevolent

NEW YORK, May 31. --The recent
criticisms of John D. Ttocke'eller, grow
ing out of his grift of $100,000 to the
American Board of Commissioners for
Foreign Mission? are declared in an
article by tho Rev, Dr. Robert Stuart
McArthur, pastor of the Calvary Bap
tist Church of this city, to be published
to-morrow in thÂ« Examiner, a Baptist
publication, to be coarse, cruel and per
haps criminal, and to have maligned
the entire Baptist denomination. . HÂ«*
"protests against the condemnation of
our churches by these cowardly and un
cjust attacks," declares that no one
linows better than Rockefeller that he
cannot buy the approval of Baprists by
his millions, and that Baptists would
advocate his expulsion from the church
If it were proved that he had acquired
his money dishonestly or by means
morally or socially destructive.
He adds that he has investigated cer
tain business transactions, which have
been fiercely denounced by .Rockefel
ler's critics, and has found them in ac
cordance with the highest standards of
commercial morality. Rockefeller, he
asserts, is worthy of confidence, admi
ration and affection, and - appeals for,
fairness of judgment for him. .The
writer continues;
"I have known Mr. Rockefeller /or
many year* and my/ intimate personal
acquaintance with him has convinced
me that he is worthy of the highest
honor as a man and of the fullest con
fidence, esteem and affection as a Chris
tian. In so enormous a business as
that of the Standard Oil Company it Is
inevitable that <agenis of the company
perform acts without Mr. Rockefeller's
knowledge and without his approval.
A high officer of the Standard Oil Com
pany Intimately acquainted for nearly
a generation* with Sir. Rockefeller's
daily influence in his counsels, informed
me recently that Mr. Rockefeller had
always been quick to deplore and to
correct instances of unjust and injur
ious over-real."

DR. M. LEISER of New York has announced a new cure for
consumption. There is no secret about its composition, while
eight months' careful experiment has gone far to justify the
discoverer in making it known. At the same time it would.be well
to receive the statement with some measure of "caution. >: Other rem
edies have been hailed with the same confidence after the, same "ap
parently satisfactory tests and have none the less proved ultimately
to be disappointing. -
At the same time consumption seems to.be. one of those dis
eases that medical science is destined speedily to vanquish. -Its
outer fortifications at least have been captured and in its early, stages
â¢it is no longer to be counted as an incurable malady. Open air, and
sanitation ' under skilled direction have worlced miracles : in robbing
the white plague of many of its terrors, and even should it- prove
that the . importance ofÂ° Dr. Leiser's remedies has been .overesti
mated, it seems likely a substantial step forward -has been- made!
One hundred consumptive patients, have thus far been' treated with'
the new inhalations, and the results reported certainly seem to jus
tify a sanguine view. - WBBBUBtsmitiÃttÃÃUBÂ£&

. 17"\ALEOXTOLOGY is enriched by the discovery of a new group
r"of saurians peculiar to California. Individuals of the group have
been found in perfect form around Mount Shasta. These great
lizards were aquatic and swished their long tails in the wet when
water was not as scarce in California .as it is now. Their dental
apparatus consisted of teeth a good deal like those of a bat, though
large enough to make toothache give rise 6 to an outcry -that could
be heard through all lizardom. They had such an excellent diges
tion that in the stone stomachs that have been found there -is no
trace of undigested food. Their prehistoric gastric juice was the
real thing and converted their victuals into bone and muscle without"
the aid of a dinner pill. o â¢ â¢ â¢
The discovery of this distinctly Caiifornian "Saurus 'proves that
in â¬ the geologic ages, so long before the fall of '49 that the rocks
are* the only documents of record that tell their stbry, this State
was just as' pre-eminent over the /est of c the world as it is* now.
California had .her long, lithe, reptiles, and did hot
depend upon importations... She' was independent of Chicago and
Liverpool. quotations in saurians, for she raised. her. own. . We havt
no doubt that investigation "and research will finally disclose that
was here before the Neanderthal man settled in .Germany, and
that he was greatly superior to that hard-featured citizen. California
has always had her climate; her saurians and her peculiar gifts and
graces; and her geologic ages, in long processjoh 'have passed like
a watch in the night, regardless of what was doing elsewhere.
OUR OWN' SAURUS.
THE news dispatches announce the arrival of Mr. Dalrymple in
Chicago. Mr. Dalrymple is regarded as the; municipal street
railway expert of Glasgow, and he is summoned by the new
Mayor of Chicago to impart- wisdom in regard. to municipal roads
for the benefit. of Chicago first, and secondarily for the enlighten
ment of the United States oh that interesting subject.
His city of Glasgow has been very naturally and properly re
garded as the model for the world in municipal trading. There are
certain facts about the Glasgow street railways that Mr. Dalrymple
will not be expected to talk about. In this country the whole sub
ject is so intermixed with party politics that it is a hazy matter, but
little understood. As a rule its advocates present it to the. public
as a means of getting something for**hothirig. The, most persistent
proponent of the policy is Mayor Tom-Johnson of Cleveland. His
latest delivery' is to the effect. that all cities should own their street
railways and give their use to the people free! "The force of such
an appeal in behalf of this policy should not be underestimated nor
derided. No lure is more seductive than the illogical offer of some
thing that has' value, without money and without price. â¢ '
Others less "demagogic or less enthusiastic than Mayor John
son point with fervor to the cheapness of the street railroad service
in Glasgow. They are 'not going to give free rides, but will give
them cheaper than now or part free. .This, class of advocates are
greater in number than the free riders who follow Johnson. They
make up the real strength of the movement. A few years ago they
were spreading the news that municipal ownership and operation
of public utilities by Glasgow, paid all the expenses of government
and entirely relieved the people of taxation. An inquiry into the
facts proved that the rate of taxation in Glasgow was as high/ if
not higher, than in San Francisco, but that demonstration left the
cheapness of the service standing as a powerful argument.
"The Municipal Year Book" gives full and reliable information
as to the street ' railway rates of Glasgow. By this it appears that
the rate in Glasgow for 0158 mile is 1 cent; for 2.30 miles, 2 cents;
for 3.48 miles, 3 cents; for 4.64 miles, 4 cents; for 5.80 miles, 5 cents;
for 6.89 miles' 6 cents; for 8.15 miles, 7 cents; for 9.09 miles, 8 cents.
At one time workingmen had a special rate of 2 cents to and from
their work, but this rate has been, withdrawn since 1901.
An Oakland paper compares these Glasgow rates and distances
with the uniform rate of 5 cents for one fare, regardless of dis
tance. The fare from the extreme border of Alameda to the ex-.
treme border of Berkeley, ten miles; is 5 cents. This is two miles
for 1 cent as against the Glasgow rate of 1 cent for half a mile. On
the whole mileage of ten miles the Glasgow rate would be 8 cents,
or 3 cents mote 'than the Oakland rate. The fares from Point Rich
mond" and other suburban points -on the east side of the bay are
only from one-half to two-thirds the Glasgow rate.
<lt is more than six miles from the foot of Market street in San
Francisco to the ocean beach, fare 5 cents. By the Glasgow rate
it would be 6 cents. The Glasgow rate applied to San Francisco
would <:ost the mechanics and working people who seek cheap and
good homes here at a distance .from their work more car fare than
they pay new. A thorough analysis of the Glasgow rates and com
parison with- the rates in San Francisco and "Oakland prove that
our -uniform fare of 5 cents, regardless of distance, is a cheaper
rate than the mixed" or variable, rates of Glasgow.
."Going to another phase of the question, a comparison of wages
proves that with a cheaper fare than Glasgow wages ; paid to car
crews here are much higher. Glasgow pays to car crews an average
of $6 50 per week. The average on all the municipal roads of
Great Britain is.si per day. At the hour rate paid here the men
make more than 100 per cent more than the Glasgow cr(*vvs. The
average monthly wage per man in street car crews in Great Britain
is $30. Here it is $75. Her% there is but little exposure and none
of the inclement weather that must be. endured in the cold "Scotch
winters. These facts and figures, bearing upon rates and wages,
may not abate the enthusiasm of the advocates of municipal owner
ship, but they do have a tendency to somewhat shorten the pedestal
upon which Glasgow has .been mounted as a burning and shining
light for an example to American cities.
All plans and policies are subject to change and improvement.
If American cities want municipal Ownership let them improve
upon what -.has been done by detaching the public credit from mu
nicipal plants entirely. Make each dne pay its own cost and ex
pense of operation out of its own revenues, and then we will be able
to judge of the propriety of our cities going into trade. *

Board of Police Commlulonrn. How
Â° ever. Declares Story of Lee Sam
Â° Bon a Joke.
The; Board of Police Commissioners
sat for two hours last night investigat
ing what at first promised to be another
Chinatown scandal, but which proved,
when looked, into, to be the mere as
sertions of a Chinese gambler who has"
disappeared and for whom the police
are 'looking.
The o Information came to the board
early yesterday morning that Lee San
Bow, a Chinese pavrnbroker at the cor
ner of Ross alley and .Washington
street, had assembled a number of his
brother gamblers In the Hung Tie Low
restaurant, "at 808 Dupoht street, and
in great secrecy had there told them
that he had o indirectly received a prop
osition from Mayor and, Abe
Ruef whereby gambling might be re
sumed once more -In Chinatown without
fear^of raiders. Lee Bow said that the
word to him had come through a "whi*eÂ°
politician" \u25a0 whose name he would not
mention,, even to the Chinese he had
gathered. , â¢
Â° But the elation of the Chinese over
the fact, that there was? a possibility
ofca gambling revival wastoo great to
allow them to keep . their -pledge c of
secrecy, inviolate aÂ»d the news, of the
meeting soon reached the j ears of the
commissioners. They dispatched Ser
geant Ross to look | the matter up and
to report to them to-night. The latter
was unable to find Lee Bow, who seems
to have Â«i>ddenly dropped _out of sight,
but he ob'tainetf all of .-the details of the
meeting from other Chinamen.
"The board ; regards the , matter ,. as a
scheme of = Lee Bow to gather, in. some
money; and start a little excitement in
Chinatown. *J- In^the-'j meantime] it Is
keeping a watchful eye out for him and
for the alletredwhlte politician. It has
sent him a notice, to appear on Friday
and show cause why his license as a
pawnbroker: should not be revoked.

Â° LOS ANGELES." May 31.â Rev. George
P. Runkle, pastor of the- First German
Lutheran CJiurcn of this city, died to
day of heart failure following an oper
ation to which . he submitted last Fri
day, i o " ' -T- ' . ' \u25a0 . â¢. -i
ClcrfTj-mnn Dlea of Heart Pallnre.
o A few <y ears ago Mr; Cross gave up his
residence .in .this city and made his home
at 927 North Baker street, Stockton, . at
which address the funeral services will
take place Friday afternoon.
James .Cross, 0 one of California's 5 most"
prominent citizens, died in Stockton, yes
terday after a lingering illness of several
years. The deceased had long been, a
sufferer from heart disease, and death,
which was not unexpected, o brought re-.
Uef .o A wife, a stepdaughter and a step
son survive .him.* .... .
ilr. Cross was for many years a resi
dent of this city and was prominent In
, club circles, being a j member of the Pa
cific-Union 0 Club. From 1894 to 1898 he act-"
ed as president of the Hobart estate. He
also managed the Utica mine at Angels.
; Mr. Cross was born In New York State
= sixty-five years ago. He came to Cali
fornia in hls c youth and had been promi
nently connected with many big enter
prises. He was identified with some of
Nevada's richest, mines "and -made* and
lost " fortunes in mining deals. 'He had
been identified -\rith an electric plant . at
Red Bluff/ Â° Â° Â°: . '
After the conference with the Forty
fourth dissolved .the executive fcommit
tee conferred with delegates' from thÂ«
Thirtieth and. Thirty-sixth districts.
'./ Last evening the representatives of
the Forty-fourth District submitted a
large number of names from which ojhe
executive committee may select a com
mittee of ten for the district. It Â° was
the sense of the conference c that all
factions of the Republican party should
have representation on the committee.
The fact was admitted that the forces
of the unclean In municipal politics
were fairly well organized in the
Forty- fourth, and Jhat good citizens of
the district must unite in order to
.Achieve success at the primary elec
tion in August. The sentiment wasex
.pressed that vlctorf could be won if
the conflicting elements in the^ Repob-
Jican party could be brought together.
lilany individual assurances were given
that the animosities or the past \ had
been obliterated and that c the Republi
can leaders a*id workers would act in
iiarnioayjto -wrest the city from the
dutches-iof -Kuef. c \u25a0o= - c
_"\u25a0â¢;*â¢ Jt is common knowledge that the
'supporters of Schmitz and Buef are
greatly alarmed J over the growing
jstÂ«ngthof the Republican League. So
i-iaany voters in the labor camp are ex
pressing the opinion that a change In
\u25a0the management of municipal affairs, is
\u25a0demanded that Ruef begins to fear
.that the old-time Republicans in the
Union Labor party will . go over In a
body and Join the army of good citizen
ship under the banner of the league.
In orfier to forestall such action the
false report . is. circulated that I theÂ°
league 4s connected with the Citizens.'
\u25a0Alliance. \u25a0 -â¢cr: -&*?!?"*,'%s*-
ThÂ« San Francisco Itepublican
tÂ«ea.s:ue is making noteworthy prog
ress in the "work of organizing- the
forces of good citizenship for the mu
nicipal campaign of this year.
Last night at league headquarters,
656 Market street, delegations from
the Forty-fourth Assemb-ly District ex
changed views with George D. Clark,
Daniel A. Ryan, Fairfax H. Wheelan,
Richard J. Welch. David /Rich "' And
John LÂ«ickmann of the executive com
mittee. The o district representation
was very large- .i; <V 5 * Â°
i* Mr. ' 'Wheolan. speaking in. behalf of
the "organization, defined the purposes
of the league. He told the represent
atives of -the *Forty-fourth that the
grafters were circulating the false"-re
port that the San 'Francisco Republi
can League was .governed -by. the Cit
izens' Alliance.. Ife asserted positive
ly that the league was not connected
.with the alliance in any form, and
made. thÂ« further declaration that. he
vas not a member of the "Citizens' Al
liance himself and was assured that
not, one of his associates on the exec
utive committee was a member.

necessary to gain the homeless young- j
sters admission, the motive that prompts j
the support of the refuge 1b religious, and i
the play selected > for ; the [ benefit \u25a0 was j.
chosen for its sacred character. J
â The people who patronized the play last j
night helped " the , philanthropic \u25a0- priest to V
give ( these boys ,the , benefit .'of a .home, !
better than some of ithemcould enjoy 'If j
living -with their " parents. The- interest j
aroused ;in this ; noble work | is 'not only,)
. caused by^ . the housing of - orphans, 'but
because of the novel methods adopted by ,
the conductor^ the home. : ' - /
It is the purpose "of the Rev. Father
Crowley to . educate \ the boys under his
charge to the realization of the value of
practical knowledge, and to this end he
has established a farm near Napa, where
a class of the homeless "students is being \
given instruction in husbandry. g The slo-. i
gan "back to the land" has been adopted
by Father Crowley , and a generation of
practical farmers coming F from the E city
will be the ' unusual Â» result when the
priest's hopes are realized.
It takes funds; to do'the'< work under
taken, because the home' on ;Nineteenth .
street and the farm are expensive instlf ;
tutions, so it becomes necessary, to call on
the public for aid.: The crowd'at: the ,
Grand last night did not come |up to the .
expectations of the ladies, under t whose

Both the' Tigers and the" Oaks played
some baseball while the strife r was- on.
They were not any too"; fast . in 'their
movements, but they were going all the
time. ' They. I fought and '* tugged and
stalled around, keeping runs ' away,
when they seemed ready to arrive. .',
Young Hogan managed* to. keep the
ball where the Tigers could not get. a
gjbbd wallop 7 at T it. Tacoma started by
clouting that leather-something awful.
Doyle opened it. up^wltbj a" double, and
many -others followedfL'but" only one
counted lo the score,': which;- shows the
young busher had something.
. Errors let in both runs. v The Tigers
got theirs In the second when Francks
booted Doyle's "hit" and he went' around
"to third on Sheehan's out, Devereaux to
Strei'b. Along came; Nordyke- w" th .; a
drive- agains.t the right field fencr 'hat
proved to -be -a two-sacker with the
genuine seal on.
The Oaks .brought one over I; the
second. Devereaux took four\iind
Francks' laid down 'a pretty bunt after
two were faded. Patriarch | Peter Loh
man" unloaded a "iexas; leaguer .over
Nordyke's : ; head and everybody : started
to run while Thomas booted the ball.
Devereaux slid ' It,', though any kind of
an old throw' would have copped 'him
at ihe pan. .

Gladys BÂ«lle had not started since sha
left the Seattle track last season.- Her
conduct at the post in tne past has been
notoriously worse than that ot Whiskey

OPPOM3XT IX HIS FIGHT
Hanlon is in- the finest of fighting fet-r
tie at his Alameda quarters and â¢ the
gong' cannot sound the onset of .battle
any too soon to plelsc : the gritty little^
scrapper. Eddie has had no difficulty*
in shedding avoirdupois and the stip*
.ulated treigjit, JL3O pounds/is practical
ly "a catch weight for hiro. t Eight miles
road running in the morning â¢with .Toby
Irwin a's his pacer and an hour^in the
gymnasium in the \u25a0afternoon constitut
ed Hanlon's training work yestefrday.
He trounced f the bba r for four rounds,
jumped the rope for fifteen â minutes
and feinted and tugged with Irwin for
thirty minutes. To-day Eddie will go
through the same stunts and then his
work will be over until he enters the
ring. . ;'â¢";" *- Â°
Totms Corbett -has at Jast convinced his
friends that be will have no. difficulty in
rawing | the required weight' to-morrow
night when he meets Eddie Jlanlqn in
Woodland's Pavilion under the auspices
of tie San Francisco Athletic Cliib. â¢..'
He expects to go to/bed to-night weigh
ing 12SX pounds. He Invariably loses a
pound during the night, so He expects to'
make up. to-morrow .weU within the re
quired 150 pounds. . = *
He changed his* usual routine yesterday
afternoon. cAt three o'ciocK be. weighed :
125>A pounds and instead of going- on the
road he waited until evening. He had an i
early dinner And started 'out for his road j
work some two hours later. He . was ac
companied "by Dave ' Barry and George
Herbert. He weighed about IS2 pounds
when he returned after a brisk run in the
warm evening air. " â¢->-'â¢
Corbett thinks he overdid , his boxing
practice when he trained for Nelson and ;
has devoted more atteni^on "this time to
road work. He had some llverj* bouts
with Dave Barry last week. He had the'
gloves on with him on i Monday for the ;
last time. This will give him four days'
rest from boxing befcire the fight.
Enough wagering-" was done yester
day to indicate that Corbett will be-an
8 to 10 public, choice. .His friends ad-
mlt that he Is, to all outward appear
ances/ In the best -possible" condition.
The test of the vitality will come when
he faces Hanlon a"nd travels some fast
rounds at the clip the Californian will
take him.. " -.â¢"'\u25a0 \u25a0'<\u25a0

i. . The, origin-^ and nature of : the black

It ? seems certain . that, the infection .was
brought "by the ships of certain traders

had ' been Vattacked-by Ithe* Tartars at ' a
tpw^i 1 . oor,n r , the'rlver Don." During the at

injo trie town. .Their hopes were fuKllled,"
and -the 'defender! were also attacked ",by r
v th.e ' plague. 'These traders took to" their'
ships and sailed :!_ to r various v European

â¢hlndJtheihi^Thls -black death had' *cer r
; tain y striking -features >in common - with -
â¢the -Bombay ? plague' of i lndia." A" careful
search'.'ln:.the '/records "of. : Indian- history,
has, shown .that -there;' had been an L out
break of 'plague in India' Just previous to
the time of the Tartar siege and the in
troduction of the black death into Ea
ropc'/.These, Tartars might very, easily
have taken' the disease from the people
'of India, If thaVis the true story of the
.train of events,' then * th^^ black deattT of
,the* middle, ages ',was the modern plague,
*a 1 disease j which â¢'-â¢we ; know to : be 'caused
;by' a certain specific " bacillus.
Effcrts ; have - been made *to . learn " the
means : by ' which , this disease ,Is carried,
and . what r causes lead to an outbreak.
Certain*/ facts bearing "on ." these r ] points
have i lately '.come .to ' light and ; may \u25a0 lead
to a "correct knowledge of the means ' ot

quotations of that Exchange:
NEW YORK. May 81.â The strength of to-
I day's ttock market developed In spots at first,
but the . few etrong stocks had a sympathetic
j effect on the general list and advances became
! general during the late trading. The tone was
hesitating and uncertain at first. This was
partly due to the influence of the London mar
ket, where the ending Of the stock exchange
settlement caused â¢a \u25a0 pause in ' activity. The
settlement was concluded without any damage
as a result probably of the considerable re
covery of the last few days in Americans. Its
success had an encouraging 'effect* on -stocks
here, as seme apprehension, has existed -of bad
effects from overcommitments in Americans on
the part of London speculators. International
policies seemed to play a small part in the
market and the belief that an early peace was
to be forthcoming was not so distinct a factor
as on Monday. Japanese bonds .in ? this mar
ket continued, to overshadow all others in
â¢prominence, but moved with some*lrregular
ity. Realising in them was in evidence after
the opening and the first series 6s were carried
to a sharp tract tonal loss, but they recovered
In company with the rest of the market.- Evl.
dence of pressure - atrfflnst the . United - States
.Steel stocks, was a factor in turning prices
downward during "the morning.' Reports were
current that practically all existing pools and
'agreements to maintain prices in the trade
were in course of dissolution following the ex
ample of the steel rail pool. Fears were en
tertained that, this would serve to add -to the
diftfcultles of keeping up prices and . would
increase the * pressure to dispose of stocks.
With the possible exception of the crop out.
look there is no one subject to which so much
importance is attached as to the course to be
taken by' the iron and steel ' trade. A demon
stration that *the present lull In the trade. Is
but temporary would have the effect of re
solving much of the doubts now reflected in
the stock marked. "News of weather condi
tions were regarded as favoring the grain
crops, but "the', weekly crop bulletin, of .the
Weather Bureau, received a mixed lnterpreta
tlon. The upward movement of the latter part
of the -day received its first definite Impulse
from the uggreoslve advance In Reading. No
Immediate news was forthcoming -to < explain
the etrength of '.this stock, but there were ru
mors Alleging an intended increase In -the
dividend on the Central Railroad of New Jer
sey and from th,es6 .inferences were drawn lof
more liberal dividend policy .on the part' of the
Reading Itself which controls the Central of
Ntw Jersey and this served to arouse hopes of
'coming* benefits, also for Baltimore and Ohio,
Norfolk and Western and Chesapeake and Ohio
stocks. Vhe expected report on Che Investiga
tion of the Equitable Life Assurance Society
was* awaited with great Interest and with
professions of hope that its publication would
mask the close of the controversy on that
subject. 'Om effect pointed out from the wip
\u25a0 ing out of the Russian ( naval force Is the
opening of the way for free transport of Jap
.anese rurplies from this country. Jt (s ex
pected that this may facilitate the outlay. in
this country, of tome part of the proceeds of
the Japanese loan still on d-. petit in New
York. There was a great deal of revival gos
sip concerning Union Pacific accompanying the
larpe buying of that stock, but there wae not

"It Is somewhat premature to anticipate any

dÂ»wn an opinion yesterday which pre
cludes the possibility of another contest

lack of success attending the efforts of
the contestants in a numbex of caie*lt }s
not: deemed probable that the fight will
â¢again be transferred to tne United States
courts. â¢
The legal battles for the control^of thÂ©
Blythe estate have been In prdgr^ss al
most continuously for more | thari* fifteen
years." " The contest; decided yesterday was
the last desperate effort of the V'Jones
claimants" to wrest a portion of the prop

Moore. .-,-,. ,/ .-: *
Thomas Blythe died on April .4, . 18S3.
Shortly afterward -.- his daughter, Mrs.
Moore, institu ted proceedings to establish *
her claim of heirship. Others who thought
they were entitled to a share of. the mil- #
lion-dollar estate I were John .TV. Blythe,.
Henry. T. Blythe. Boswell M. Blythe and
what were known as the "Williams claim^
ants" : and the. "Jones claimants."
State "and Federal courts of all degrees
sustained the contentions of the daugh
ter. The United States Supreme Court
was called upon several times \u25a0to decide
features of the dispute. Florence Blythe
Hlnckley Moore won in practically every
Instance. > ./ '";._* - . : ,
The property which has been in dispute
for so long Is the block bounded by, Grant

worth somewhere near J3.000.000. It has

â¢Secrecy 'has; been maintalr/ed by the
investigators^ for obvious reasons. ,The
actual Increase, in" population - Is one
point for study, and the statistics are
awaited with, interest by the postal ser
vice." The increase in the .weight of the
mails is another"? item- of concern.
Whether the letter> carriers ; are" per
forming their duty, fully, and j how; many
assistants 1 they need to ' insure ; prompt
collection and delivery, of the malls are
subjects being talked about by the in

Some time ago Eostmaster, Fisk asked
for -additional letter carriers' and" this
has .; resulted in. the field being
looked;; over.; that 5 all the facts relating
to the "postal 1 service in thisTcltyiinay
become offlcially known/ â¢ ,
\u25a0 An investigation of the postal ser
vice of San Francisco is in progress.
Skilled men are considering it from ev
ery point of view. Quietly -they have
begun their, work and are pursuing it
unheralded and as far from tho glare
of the lime light of : publicity as pos
sible. Their, investigation will deter
mine what answer shall be made to the
demand of Postmaster Fisk for added
facilities for the city.
According 1 to' the calculations of the
postal people, the service is now given
to 450,000 persons.. In San Francisco,
counting in the transient populatlpn.
The business of the local postofflce
amounts to $1,600,000; annually. The
coming discontinuance of Station D and
the necessity; for- some ;new | arrange
ment jto provide for prompt . service In
the wholesale sections of the city,-to
gether with the added number of-jlarge
office, buildings which require the un
divided attention of .carriers, are* fac
to rs^ in the neworderof things." Prob
ably within the next fortnight. the In
vestigation into /all; the conditions will
end and the report to be made is likely
to determine questions of 'first: im-"
portance ;to \ the - business , interests of
San Francisco. : ; ,-.';; '
At the meeting of the Board of
Health to-day, the "report" will , be sub
mitted in tabulated; ; form and "the
names of the sellers will- be ; revealed.
Their i names s will :-"J appear:- upon the
blackboard of t - the Board^of Health! and

and the, aid of the 1 Chief iof -Police will
be invoked . to^ break-up this practice.

City Chemist Gibbs yesterday, report
ed to the Health Board that chemical
analyses of of; -meat taken
from various butcher, shops ir^. this; city
disclosed the use of ; preservatives and
dyestuffs therein. Gibbs says it -is the
practice of some butchers ,to add a sul
phite compound < to o their 'meat <to .give
it a bright red:' color \u25a0to simulate the
appearance of being freshly.) cut.
When Health ; Officer Ragan's atten
tion was directed to ; the "practice some
three- weeks ago "he ordered samples of
the meats exhibited in "restaurants and
stores to; be brought, to; the 'laboratory
for. examination. ; Out Â»of .147 'of 'such
samples it was found that; 16. contained
coal tar dye;' lS; contained foreign sub
stances, such , as .starch' arid" ' sodium
salts; 117 contained sodium sulphite: 7
contained' boric' acid; ; 6 contained ni
trates, and only 25 samples of the 147
were pure meat products.

line of questions asked by Cpllhis In .each
case was practically â¢the/same. At the
close of the day's proceeding?" be -stated"
th*.i his main idea in asking 'the "series
of questions was an attack 'on the* validity
of iha. inquisitorial body. Should 'Collins*
fail in, his motion' to have the" indictment
dismissed, he will -have 'caused s .a* bulky
record for the Stipreihe^ Court "to fathbm

The other members of the Granp Jury

.finding of" the mdictment. "He was also
asked whaf Impression . newspaper ac

eented to Judge. Lawlor. He then related
the circumstances of Its withdrawal so
that the wteds "willfully. . unlawfully,
knbwingly and feloniously" t migljt be ln-
Berted. .'This reauired a second vote in
the Jury-room.and was virtually a second"
indictment. Ho told how at the first vote
there were .fourteen members of the Jury
\u25a0present, but at the second only. thirteen.
1 He 'could not remember which" Juror It
was who left or 'who acted as secretary.
It was subsequently. developed -that WII-
P<jrcher .told how he took the tally of
the votes on the second Indictment, but
added that he had destroyed the record
after telling its substance . to Secretary
Bryan. . * .. ..* . , .
Another witness questioned exhaustivejy
was Porcher. Collins" wanted to know ex
actly what his duties as temporary secre
tary were.at the time of the indictment.
He also wanted to know who were pres
ent, a^id asked the witness to name them.
.At this point Collins became facetious.
"Curran," he' said, "Is one, and Newman
â Newman he*fc another. I. mean' ; lie's
another person." This provoked- a laugh
'.in the courtroom and called forth' a re
buke from the court. ' ' . â¢ '/ ' . '.

"the first Vote -ahd . left before the second,
