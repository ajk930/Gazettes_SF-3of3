Secretary of Navy
Will Appeal to
Congress.
Hopes to Get Sufficient
Funds to Construct
Three Vessels.
Compromise May Be Brought
About by Chairman of
Naval Committee.
Bpeciil Dispatch to TbÂ« Ca'.l.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 10.â There is prac
tical confirmation to-day of the rumor of
last week that the general board of the
ravy Intends to ask Congress through
Secretary Bonaparte for three new first
class battleships. As a result of this in
tention of the naval experts, Representa
tive George E. Foss of Chicago will have
unpleasant work thrust upon him at the
coming session.
Foss Is chairman of the House Commit
tee on Naval Affairs, and he will need all
thih diplomacy to frame an appropriation
bill that will satisfy an economically
minded Congress and an extravagantly
minded department. The result probably
mill be a compromise such as was effect
ed at the last session.
There are statements to the effect that
the department desires not only the au
thority to build three battleships, but to
add ten or a dozen boats .of other
classes to the navy. There is/ however,
no definite knowledge to be had on the
subject, save in regard to the three large
vessels, which it is known Congress will
be asked to furnisb the money to con
struct.

withdrew from the ministerial branches
during an angry debate in the Chamber
of D.eputles and thereafter announced his
resignation. For. a time .the. entire Cab

Rouvier announced the *cadineES of him
self and his colleagues to give up .power
unless tkey were supported by a substan
tial majority. -After -a'- debate -'of excep
tional violence a motion favorable to the
Ministry prevailed by a vote of ,310 to 147.
However, the ministerial majority is made
up of fractlons.pf- divergent- groups and
the future of "the Cabinet remains, -in
doubt. \u0084 . â¢ ! '.:..*/, . \u0084- - ;
After the Bession the Premier went to

and at which, also.lt; is .possible .further
rearrangement of the , Cabinet ; will be
considered. M. Etlenne, now Minister ;, of

probable successor to M.j Berteaux,', . M.
Thomson,, Minister of Marine,', succeeding
M. Etlenne. Generals, Langlois; and, Brun
are also mentioned; for the ' war, portfolio^
but the socialists threaten ; not to sup
port the Ministry if a generalbe chosen

M. Berteaux in. an interview this even-
Ing said his resignation* was] not Intended
to embarrass the Ministry, but that he was
unable to tolerate the humihatlng.position
of the Ministry In being dependent 'upon

COLUMBUS, Ohio, Nov. 10.-Complete
returns on the State ticket, except for
Governor, are still unavailable to-night,
with tbe result that, both the ! Republi
cans and Democrats continue '.o claim
the election of all minor State offices.
Official returns received from eighteen
counties show that Harris, the Republi
can candidate for lieutenant Governor.
h;-Â£ an average lead in each county "of
7,0 over Herrfek for Governor. If this
ratio should be maintained in the re
mainder of the eighty-eight counties in
tbe State, which is considered doubiful.
lu;rris would have a lead of 66.000 over
Herrick in the State.
This would Insure the election^ not only
of Harris for Lieutenant Governor but all
the remainder of the Republican State
ticket, as Harris apparently received the
lewppt vote next to Herrick.
Attorney General Ellis and State Treas
urer McKlnnori claim tbAt returns re
ceived by them from a fcajority of the
counties in this State Indicate their elec
tion by a plurality of 15,000 to 20,000.
The Republicans claim the lower branch
of the Legislature by sixty-two to flfty
nine, and the Democrats claim It by the
eair.e figures. On the face of- the
ui'.oflicial returns the Senate is composed
of nineteen Democrats and eighteen Re
publicans, but the Democrats claim It by
twenty to seventeen. ....

PACKAGE CONTAINS
PEOOF OF MAMIAGE
LONDOX, Nov. I\>. â By permission of
King Edward, the Daily Chornicle as.
certs a package of papers, consigned
to the care of Coutts Bank by Mrs.
Fitzherbert (Maria Anne Smythe) un
der the stipulation that it was not to
be opened for a long period, has now,
after seventy years, been opened and
proved to contain the marriage certifi
cate and other indisputable proofs that
George .IV was actually married to
Mrs. Fitzherbert.
Mrs. Fitzherbert became the wife of
the Prince of Wales, afterward George
IV, in December, 1785. The marriage
of the Prince was invalid under' En
glish law, though it was sanctioned by
the Roman Catholic church, of^ which
Mrs. Fitzherbert was a member. It
was expected that the papers In
Coutts Bank would settle a question
which has. agitated Lne British public
for over a century as to whether there
was issue from the marriage, but there
is nothing in the foregoing dispatch to
chow that the question had been solved.
It had been long reported that
there was actually a male child and
that this child err.igra. d to the United
States and settled In Washington, where
he died some years ago, after living
very quietly, but In good circumstances.

Famous Character of the Pacific Coast
Pauses Atvnj-.
BUTTE. Nov. 10.â In the death of Cor
nelia P. Taylor here to-day one of the
roost picturesque characters of the Coast
States has Dassed away. He was a Jus
tice of the peace and was "1 years of age.
Before coming to Butte fifteen years ago
Taylor had been a Superior Judge In Cal
ifornia, a leading lawyer In | San Fran
cisco and Portland. He edited the East
Portland Star with such brilliancy and
vigor that he. became a rival to Harvey
Ecott of the Oregonian. His editorials
were classics on the coast.
Taylor was a witness to the duel when
Judge Terry of California killed Senator
Broderick. He was a Terry partisan and
â¢was frequently mixed up in quarrels over
the affair. V '.
Taylor was an uncompromising South
ern Democrat, having been born in' Te
nnessee. He loved politics, and as he could
secure nothing In Oregon be left there
und came to Montana. He was married,
but nothing Is known here of his wife.
He has relatives at Grass Valley, Cal.

INSURANCE COIN
LENT FOR SONG
Big Sum Put Out to Favored
Bank by Metropolitan at
Oiie and a Half Per Cent
NEW YORK.-Nov.-ie.â Closing the ses
sions of the week to-day the Armstrong
committee of insurance investigation has
behind it a mass of details . and figures
which, while of apparently little Interest
to the laity, is of inestimable value to the
committee. The greater part of the week
has been devoted to the Metropolitan LJfe
Insurance Company, the examinations of
President Hegeman and.. Jamefc M.
Cralgh, the actuary of the' company, be
ing of a most technical nature. When
adjournment was taken. to-day the com
mittee had not finished the examination
of President Hegeman, and he will be
called again next week.
Just before the hour of adjournment to
day Hegeman was and; Joseph
Howard Jr., a writer who has been em
ployed by the Mutual Life, was called to
the stand. He Identified vouchers that he
had signed for money received for writ
ing advertisements and reading notices
for the Mutual ; Life. Howard afforded
much amusement by. his declaration that
his only regret was that he could not
elgn more of these vouchers, j His only
complaint was that he was not paid
enough for his work. This, too, was the
complaint on the witness stand of Charles
Smith, who also does writing for the
Mutual Life and receives $8000 a year
for It.
Howard said he had been employed
thirty or forty years by the Mutual Life,
but the vouchers went back only to 1599.
There were ten of these vouchers, aggre
gating $16,625. Howard denied that he
had ever sent any dispatches by wire,
and was very strenuous in his assertion
that he had never 'written a line about
Insurance for any paper on Which Tie Vas
employed, characterizing k it .as a, /'dirty
trick." V ' â¢ *
BLOW AT EQUITABLE. J . j.
-William Barnes Jr., formerly ; of .Al
bany, who now resides at Nantucket,
appeared before the committee at his
own request and was the first? witness of
the day. Barnes* name appeared, in the
Investigation several weeks ago when
vouchers were produced for legal ser
vices. Barnes explained his connection
with the Insurance company, answered
the questions put to him, and when his
examination had bÂ«en concluded asked to
be allowed to make a statement. He was
given the privilege and had proceeded
but a little way when he was stopped by
Senator, Armstrong ; because Barnes'
statement was an argument in defense of
insurance companies along the , , lines
brought out in' the investigation... In the
course of his statement he said:
"The Equitable is a one-man power to
day. Just as much as it ever was, \u25a0' except
for the change of the name ,of the man
from James Hazen Hyde to Thomas F.
Ryanâ that Is the only _ change made4
and the policy holders have no controlling
power in 1L" . .
President John R. Hegeman of the Met
ropolitan Company" was recalled during
the day. Letters of complaint. that poli
cies were paid to undertakers by indus
trial companies were read to Hegeman,
and he said he could not say that his
company had ever; made such a; pay
ment. . .- ~i \u25a0_..'.." \u0084..â,',.' /â,!_
MO.VEY ASKED *F<mi CAJIPAIGX. "7;
Hegeman said hlg. company . had f made
but two campaign contributions, and they
were both In 1896. One thousand dollars
was given to the Palmer and Buckner
Gold Democratic . managers, and ,$7500 to
the National Republican Committee.
These contributions. , Hegeman^ald, were
made with .the, approval of the , finance
board, and were more. . a moral than a
political move' to ass|st in defeating; the
"16 to 1 heresy.". i. ."''". .'v* â¢"\u25a0" : â¢
A statement was produced showing that
Andrew Hamilton had been under an an
nual retainer of $1000, from May, 13, 18ft?,
and from that date to May 5, 1904J had re
ceived for special services and retainers
the agrgrÂ«&ate sum of $35,295.
Hegeman said the Metropolitan Life In
surance Company obtained bonds for Its
agents from either the American Surety
Company or the National Surety Com
pany. Hegeman holds ten shares of the
National. The bond required of agents
is $750, and the premium Is recovered from
the agent by the company. -
It was shown that the Metropolitan Life
made loans of $100,000 .to $200,000 at V&
per cent Interest to William Reade, of the
firm of Vermilye & Co., on various
dates in 1901 to 1903. The market rate for
call loans was at the time from' â¬& t0. 5
per cent. Vermilye . & Co. were /â¢, the
bankers of the Metropolitan.
BIG SYNDICATE PROFITS. -k^ : o
It was organized with the expectation
that it would handle the checks of the
Metropolitan Life, of which there are
several thousand at times, .and An order
that the company might have a profitable
tenant In its new building, which was
thoug-ht an admirable location for a bank.
The Metropolitan Life owns "about forty
per cent of the shares of the Metropolitan
Bank.
Hegeman's explanation .for making
these loans below." the market; rate was
that valuable services had-'bfeen rendered
the company and It sought to repay favors
where It could. - Hegeman said that
through the watchfulness of Vermilye &
Co. the Metropolitan Life Insur
ance Company "has nowthree or four mil
lions which Vcould be \ burned yp t without
Impairing the solvency of the bompany."
On -bonds and-, stock, the. Metropolitan
has cleared.-aecordlng to Hegeman,, about
$1.200,000, -.and in-syndleates ; in \u25a0â¢frhich VeT

NEW YORK," Nov. 10.â Dun's review of
trade to-morrow- will. say:
Each week brings a -stronger business
situation, seasonable weather having ; re
moved the last drawback and '/ pressure
for shipment of goods is so great in many
lines that the partial holiday put deliv
eries > still . behind , and caused
much inconvenience. Reports of whole
sale conditions are now practically unani
mous, and Improvement in collections is
noted In many dispatches." Retail 'trade
in' wearing \u25a0 apparel and foodstuffs is the
feature, S while interest -Is beginning â¢to be
shown in holiday goods,'- of" which very
large stocks were accumulated in expec
tation.of a record-breaking season.
Railway earnings thus far reported for
October show a gain of 2.5 per cent' over
last year's. Prosperity is also evidenced
by a further rise in prices of commodities,
Dun's Index number on November 1 being
$103,853, the highest 1 point of;recent'years.
The per capita amount of money in circti
lation is' also at a new record of $31 69.
The \ foreign commerce jis f fully main

JEWS DISTURB ST. PETERSBURG.
MOSCOW, Nov. 10. â Alarming reports are in circulation that anti- Jewish outbreaks will occur simultaneously here
and at St. Petersburg Sunday next. Foreigners and Jews have received threatening letters and have asked the au
thorities for protection, but thus far no step has been taken toward granting the request.
Attack Is Planned
to Occur on
Sunday.
Steps Being Taken
to Prevent an
Uprising.
Police Instructed to
Crush Any Sign
of Disorder.
ST. PETERSBURG, Nov. 11, 2:05 a. m.â
Excepting the kingdom of Poland, where
the rapidly growing Nationalist inovt
ment and the state of tension among the
proletariat will soon bring about the
declaration of a state of war, Russia
eeems for the time being at" least to be
generally tranquil. Telegrams from in
terior points report the restoration of
order In nearly all cities and towns, but
in many cities, notably St Petersburg
and Moscow, the better classes of the
population are greatly disturbed owing to
the rumors of approaching attacks by the
"Black Hundred," composed of the most
Ignorant types of the populace, which,
according to these rumors, are sched
uled to take place in St. Petersburg to
night and In Moscow- â¢ to-morrow.
The apprehension In St. Peters
burg has become -, so great that
the prefect of police, who succeeded Gen
eral Trepoff in conmmand of the city po
lice, has instructed his subordinates to
take the fullest measures' to crush any
disorder in its Incipiency so as to dis
abuse the minds of the "loyalists" of the
idea that the police would remain inac
tive. In such an emergency the strong
hand of General Trepoff is being missed,
even by the factions which most exe
crated him.
Count Witte's Cabinet may now be re
garded as constituted as Count Lams
dorJT. Minister of Foreign Affairs, and
M. Manukhin. Minister of Justice, will
retain their positions, leaving only the
posts of Ministers of the Interior and
Minister cf Education to be filled. Dmitri
Shipcff of Moscow, who was president
of the first Zemstvo Congress, has defi
nitely declined to accept any position in
the Cabinet.
GOVKKXMBXT is ACTIVE.
A long official programme published
this morning denies that disorders in any
part Ot the country have been fomented
by the Government and promises a most
careful inquiry into the outrages against
life and property and the adoption of
measures to prevent their recurrence. It
says that even were the accusations
against the Government confirmed they
would not form a pretext for the recent
terrible occurrences. ; The Government
recognizes that it is Its duty to remain
quite impartial and to give its protec
tion to all persons requiring it.
The Government will strive to fulfill the
Emperor's will regarding the freedom of
citizenship, the communication says:
"The hostile relations of different parties
and the non-participation of the Moder
ates may result in a situation unsuitable
for the introduction of reforms, but the
Government cannot think that any con
siderable part of the Russian people pre
fers disorder to order and internal strife
to peaceful development. The Council of
th* 1 Ministers is therefore ready to exe
cute the imperial command to the ut
most."
MINISTERS ARE BUREAUCRATS.
Count de Witte's Ministry as thus far
announced is a practical agreement that
be has abandoned hope of securing the
active co-operation of the Constitutional
Democrats or other parties of the Center.
The only Minister who is not a bureau
crat is M. Nemechaicff, who succeeds
Prince Khilkoff as Minister of Communica
tions. The Constitutional Democrats con
sider that they have won a great victory
in preventing any leaders of the Consti
tutional group from accepting office, say
ing that Count de Witte's Ministry is
thus stamped as purely temporary, and
must give way, immediately upon the
convening of the National Assembly, to
a Cabinet in full sympathy with the Par
liamentary majority. The Count is great
ly disappointed at the refusal of the Con
stitutionalists to support him, since it
forces him to fight on two fronts, -with
tne Reactionaries on his right and the
Social Democrats and Revolutionaries
clamoring for a republic on his left.
Count dÂ« "Witte Jias invited Count John
Tolstoi, who resigned the position of head
of the Academy of ' Fine -Arts, owing to
General Trepoff*s repressive policy. .to
take the portfolio of. education. Count
John Is no relation to Count Leo TolstoL
Professor Kevevsky has Joined Michael

NEW KEGULATIpNS
IN CONSULAR SERVICE
President and Secretary of

System.
WASHINGTON, Nov. j 10. â With the
double purpose of 'offering -.a permanent
career, in; the diplomatic and consular ser
vice to- competent young : men, and of im
proving' those branches of the Govern
ment service so as to make them more
valuable than now ;to - the business
interests of the country, the President at
the instance of Secretary : Root to-day
announced two ; new rules. V The first ot
these "has : not yet' taken .concrete form,
but its substance, as made public, was
that hereafter any applicant I for appoint
ment as secretary of embassy, or lega
tion must possess, a \ knowledge of, at
least" one more language than English,
and must be ; otherwise , examined as to
his. competency.
This rule is closely, in line with the
English .practice," and \u25a0 its; development
will involve ' the promotion of the
bright young men in the diplomatic
service in the f degree> that they justify
it by hard study, fitting them for new
posts. v'
The other order amends the existing
rule ~ which such-*; consular.,; offices Â«a-3
are timited'in to "the
maximum of J2500 per annum and a
minimum of $1000. >. This rule is
amended and 'extended* to Include con

sation of which" is not less than <1000.

SANTA ROSA. Nov. 10.â Carlton A.
Lane of this city to-day received advices
from Manila telling of the loss of his
brother. Harry G. Lane, on the inter
island stearaer Cantabria. off Tacao, in
the Philippines, on September 25, just a
month after the death of another brother
in Manila from cholera. The parents of
the two young men are Mr. and Mrs. C.
W. Lane of Calistopa. Both were well
known and very popular here.
Harry Lane went to the island as a
member of the detachment of the First
California, which was sent out to fill the
ranks cf the regiment which was short
when it tailed. He served three years,
and took his discharge when the regiment
returned and remained in the Islands to
enter into business. His brother, W. P.
Lane, went down as a civilian right after
Manila Ml, and later joined his brother.
He was the second American to lose his
life from cholera.
Harry Lane had invented a very suc
cessful hemp-stripping machine, and was
on his way to Lejasni to install some of
the new machinery, with his partner, I.
C. Smith, when the vessel was lost with
all on boardâ sixty-four in all. He was
also the inventor of a new ylang-ylang
distillery, which, it is said, would have
made fhlm wealthy and famous had he
lived to see It placed on the market.

ANNOYS AUDIENCE BY LAUGHING
LOUDLY AT STAGE JOKES.
JAMES C. CHAWFORD.
While a buxom comedienne and a sylph-
Hke ditto stood upon the Orpheum stage
and engaged in verbal crossfire the loud
and prolonged laughter of W. S. Malloy.
seated in the parquet, prevented enjoy
ment of the Intellectual feast by those
of his neighbors who were not phenome
nally sharp of hearing.
When the thin lady said anything smart
to the stout lady, and ere the latter could
retort with some saying even" more keen,
Mr. Malloy's laugh would ascend to high
pitch and there remain until the stout
lady's patience lapsed and she delivered
her "gag" anyway, said "gag" thereby
being deprived of the telling effect it
never failed to have when launched upon
an audience whose attention was not dis
tracted. And no sooner was the stout
lady's belated "come-back" sprung than
away went Mr. Malloy into renewed par
oxysm of mirth, thus embarrassing the
thin lady, who, of course, had side-split
ting response ready to hurl, but was ob
liged to retain it up her sleeve until Mr.
Mallov's spasm expired.
Thus the "act" was beinj? "queered"'
and the majority of those who had paid
for the privilege of witnessing it were
visibly annoyed, hot to Eay Indignant,
when the special policeman attached to
the theater first mildly rebuked Mr. Mal
loy and then forcibly ejected him. to the
great relief of all spectators, Including
the ladies on the stace. 1 !
When arraigned before Police Judge
Conlan on the charge of having disturbed
the p^ace* Mr. Malloy declared that his
offending was not inspired by spirit of
malice, r.or yet of mischief. For the life
of him. he said, he could not repress his
risibUs when the oral duello between the
thin lady and the stout lady was in pro
gress. He had heard and read many
humorous sayings before that petticoated
teaih of funmaket* confronted him. -but
all previous persiflage sank to serious
ness In comparison with their utterances.
And the quickness with which their Jokes
were exploded: Why, sir, it was marvel
cus. So thoroughly did each of the la
dies have rerartee at the end of her
tongue that before one of them had fair
ly concluded speaking a bright thing the
other burst In with a speech still bright
er. How on earth the girls remembered
all the remarks they madeâ for It would
be preposterous to even suspect that they
were extempore â was more than Mr.
Malloy could appreciate.
**You don't remember any of them?" the
Judge inculied. .
No; Mr. Malloy did not. He laughed so
much. andHhcy came so fast, that his
nemoiy was knocked awry.
"You didn't hear anything * about a
chicken's reasons for crossing the street
cr the cause of a miller wearing a white
hat. did youT* his Honor pursued.
"No. sir; I heard them jokes long ago,"
\wis the reply. *'-'GAl
"Do you mean to assert that tiÂ»v two la
dies said thinxs that \ we^j funnier than
those I have mentioned?*' was the court's
incredulous reiofnder.
-Sure." said Mr. Malloy.
"Well, well, well! I guess you might
as well go home. And I would suggest
that you either rauzz:e whiT*
attending comedy r>erformances or stay
away freni them altogether."
Mr. Malloy did not promise to adopt
either suggestion.

It was pleaded in behalf of Emilie Bar
suylis, accused of having .defrauded- an
innkeeper, that he \ did : not deliberately
attempt to obtain food by false pretense,
else he would have selected some other
scene of operation than the restaurant of
Edward Sheeley. at 908 Kearny street,
where the quality of the viands served is
in accordance with the prices charged,
the latter beingâ to say the leastâ cheap,
one dime being the J scheduled cost â¢ of a
meal consisting of salad, steak, coffee,
potatoes, bread and the usual condiments.
Was it likely, -the.- defense argued,
that if -Mr. Barsuylls had intended to
swindle, a* caterer: he would have chosen
Mr. Sheeley for a victim? Would it not
be reasonable to assume that some
more pretentious eating place ' would
have been picked out by him? With
dua respect to Mr. Sheelejv as a citi
zen it could not be truthfully claimed
that he'aspired to please the epicurean
or to win a clientele composed of gour
mets. â¢ Xo; he - could ..-n'otl hope to -do
that and spread a square -neal for ten
cents. Nor could lt.be eSriously im
agined that any larcenou^ly disposed
person hungry, as Mr. Barsuylis con
cededly was. would have undertaken
to wrestle with a Sheeley steak, when
he might, with no greater; risk of cap
ture and punishment, have eaten'a suc
culent tenderloin in "any ' flrst-clas3
rostlscerie. ; Might it j please the court,
the defendant's conduct reflected care
lessness, but not dishonest Intent. The
fact was that when he ordered . the
steak and. after strenuous - endeavor,
succeeded in masticating and swallow
ing it. he believed he \u25a0\u25a0. possessed ten
cents and not untirtoo late did he dis
cover.that he.was penniless. "
It was a telling argument, and"prob
ably would have won out if Judge Ca
baniss had not ascertained that Mr.
Barsuylis, a well-dressed j-oung; fel
low of Grecian ancestry, hadi commit^
ted an exactly similar offense prior to
his struggle with the Sheeley -steak: So
he was given" twenty-four hours' |imj

FRED E. MULHOLLAND.
\u25a0With everybody on the tiptoe of expect
ancy, and more owners, trainers, book
makers, jockeys and followers <^t the turf
In general congregated here than ever be
fore on ttie eve of a racing season, the
winter moeting which opens at the pic
turesque Oakland track to-day gives
every promise of being the greatest ever
beld In California,
To be sure. Sysonby. Olseau, Burgomas
ter and stars of like magnitude will not
be seen with the silks up, for the distance
and the dang-ers of the trip preclude of
their owners being tempted to come this
far. But first-class horses there are by
the ecore as in all former seasons, and It
Is history that no great horse e\"er crossed
the continent that did not return home
with at least one defeat to his credit.
This fact should be given some considera
tion by the pessimistically inclined.
The racing situation in the Middle West
the past summer has been in such an
unsettled state that San Francisco, with
no turf war or old scores to be wiped out.
looked inviting. It proved the magnet to
attract many new faces in all branches of
the sport.
Tommy Burns and some of the other old
saddle favorites will be missed, but
younger riders will usurp their laurels. \u25a0
JOCKEY HILLMAX ARRIVES.
John Bullman of the veteran guard,
looking fit as a fiddle, arrived from New
York yesterday, and in all likelihood will
have the mount on "Lucky" Baldwin's
Cruzados this afternoon. Then there is
â¢â¢Big: Bill" Knapp. California's favorite,
and now considered the premier jockey of
the country. Radtke. the apprentice, who
blazed his way to the top of the heap in
the Middle West \u25a0within an extremely
short, period of time, will make his debut
here. Willie Davis, the Eastern pilot,
caught on out here a year ago, and he
may repeat his success. Willie will hav.e
the leg up on P. Ryan's black horse San
Nicholas. Frank Graham, a promising
apprentice who topped the list of win
ning riders at Denver and Portland, will
bear watching, for he is a comer. Gra
ham is slated to ride Edwin Gaylord'a
SC-000 colt Celeres. E. Walsh can hold
his own in any man's town, and Rice,
McÃrifle, Minder, Loague the "Seattle
Garrison." Aubuchon. Tommy Clark,
Fountain and Chandler contribute to
make a eplendid complement of riding
material.
It was difficult to prognosticate last
evening: the exact number of bookmakers
that will cut In. The game is somewhat
uncertain the first fortnight, and half a
dczen pencilers appeared inclined to wait
until they could obtain a line on things.
Others were champing on the bit, eager
to break in at the start.
TWENTY BOOKS MAY WEIGH IX.
Announcer Bob McGibben eald there
would be sixteen on sure, and possibly
twenty. This number does not Include
the two little retail stores for the accom
modation of dollar bettore
The Opening handicap over a milÂ© with
the fSOOO In added money will be the fea
ture event. Unless several owners ex
perience a change of heart, the field" will
be a record breaker. The track Is not In
lightning fast condition, one trainer re
marking yesterday that he wished he was
certain his horse could step around the

have to shade this a trifle. Proper,, from

The distance may riot be Just to his fancy,
but he is the class of the race and, bar

LOGAN MUST
FACE A JURY
Church Trustee Who Eloped
With Young Girl Is Held
to Answer for Felony
SENT TO COUNTY JAIL
Counsel for Defense Seeks
to Quash Complaint; but
Judge Overrules Motion
OAKLAND, Nov. 10.-Henry A. Logan,
the renegade trustee of the First Free
Baptist Church of Oakland, . who desert
ed his wife and -child to elope with six
teen-year-old Ethel Cook, was held for
trial In the Superior Court this afternoon.
In bonds of $5000. Judge A. L. Frlck.
representing Logan, argued for a dis
missal of the complaint, on the ground
that the charge of the child's mother,
Mrs. Mary Rosa, had not been proved,
but Police Judge Samuels refused to en
tertain the motion and ordered the pris
oner into the custody of the Sheriff, to
await trial In the Superior Court.
Attorney FrJck for the defense made
an effort to show that the girl had left
her home with Logan of her own free
will and that the accused had not enticed
her away, but had rather taken her with
him when he left, at her own request.
Judge Samuels, however, in a brief re
view of the arguments of the prosecu
tion and defense, held that, In a prelim
inary examination, the court does not
consider the evidence aa does a jury, but
ascertains whether or not there Is rea
son to believe that a crime has been
committed.
In this instance the Judge held that
there was reason to believe that the
crime specified in the complaint had been
committed by the prisoner, in view ot
the fact that Logan had taken a minor
child from her home and had concealed
her whereabouts from her parents.
Prosecuting Attorneys A. P. Leach and
Lawrence Greene answered the argu
ments of Judge Frick, and at the conclu-
Eion of their arguments the â¢ case was
(submitted and Logan was held to answer.
The prisoner was transferred to the
County Jail this afternoon.

SISTERS-IN-LAW
Attorney for Widow of Frank
J. Moffitt Says She Wishes
to" Observe Spirit of Will
HEARING IS CONTINUED
Petition for Partial Dis
tribution of Estate Has Not
Yet Been Decided by Court
OAKLAND, Nov. 10.â When the petition
of thÂ» four sisters of the late Senator
Frank J. Moffltt was called in the probate
coUrt this morning it was found that the
efforts of the attorneys to compromise
had been of no avail. The four sisters of
the decedentâ Mary, Maggie, Emma and
Nellie Moffittâ had thougnt that their be
quest of $40,000 would be distributed to
them, but when Mrs. Augusta L. Moffltt,
tho widow, was called to the stand it was
shown by Attorney Phil M. "Walsh that
the estate was probably not of sufficient
value to carry out the terms of the will.
Ttie will provides that the widow shall
receive one-half the estate and an addi
tional $70,000; that the four sisters of the
decedent shall receive $40,000 and that the
son, Jefferson Molfitt shall receive $40,000.
As the appraised value of the estate is
only $235,<tJ8 70, It would be impossible for
the widow to receive one-half the estate
and $70,000 and still pay the legacies of
$80,000. ...
Attornej-s J. J. McDonald and T. J.
Lyons insisted that Mrs. Moffltt had
agreed to pay these legacies, but Mrs.
Moffitt, on the stand, testified that she
would act in accordance with the manner
in which Judge Ogden construed-" the
will. Tho matter was therefore continued
until next Monday at the request of the
attorneys for the sisters and at that time
the intent of the decedent will be argued.
In an interview this afternoon Attorney
Walsh said that at all times Mrs. Moffltt
had been willing and ready to place in
the hands of the trustees $40,000 for her
sisters-in-law, but that she preferred to
have had the court interpret the will.
"In other words," said Attorney Walsh.
"Mrs. Moffltt is anxious to carry out the
spirit as well as the letter of her hus
band's will and tho trustees for the.sis
ters will receive $40,000 without delay." â¢

Speaks of Need of
Honest Men^in
Politics.
BERKELEY, Nov. 10.â John 8. Part
ridge was given a reception by thÂ«. stu
dents and faculty of the University of
California In Harmon Gymnasium this
morning that discounted "any ovation any
guest of the university has received In
many a year. The cheers for Mr. Part
ridga were continued i for several minutes
while the former candidate for the Mayor
alty of San Francisco stood, a pleased
smile on his face,- waiting for the extra
ordinary tumult to cease, that he might
address the university men present.
"Getting licked doesn't count' for so
much after that, boys," said Partridge,
acknowledging : the demonstration. "I
take pleasure in saying to you college
men, who know and honor fair play In
every contest, that although It was my
fortune to be defeated In the recent po
litical contest In San Francisco, the
fight I fought was an -honorable fight
That Is to me as Important a feature as
any of the affair, and it Is \u25a0worth, remem
bering/ \u25a0 . : '
Partridge-is an alumnus of the Univers
ity. To-day he urged college men to In
terest themselves in poll tics, declaring
that their services are needed by the
State and nation, and that their ideal of
fair play and honorable dealing must be
carried into the world of politics, even
though they are pretty sure to encounter
opposition that is distinctly unfair, and
possibly dishonest.
"To-morrow afternoon," said Partridge,
"you will meet in a contest on the foot
ball field eleven men from Stanford," and
though the contest will be strenuous and
hard fought, there will be fair play for
all.^You cannot expect or hope for that In
political contests, perhaps, but even if
the prospect is distasteful, on that ; or
any other account,, still it is your duty
and your privilege 'to take up the gage,
help to fight the battle for good govern
ment and acctult yourselves like men at
every, stage of, the fight."
Mr. Partridge was introduced to Profes
sor Charles Zueblin %of the department
of sociology of the University of Chica
go. Professor Zueblin Is delivering a
series of lectures before the California
Club, and to-day delivered a message of
hope to those who are interested in mu
nicipal reform matters. He declared that
in spite of reports of corruption in vari
ous cities, they are not any worse gov
erned than are the States, and that tlfe'
abolition of municipal corruption can
soon be effected If the^' truth is recognized
that tho real "graft er"~ Is* the rich cor
poration which buys special "rights,"
and bribes officials to procure -those
"rights/ thus "grafting" in ithe" most
pernicious way of all.
The speaker declared bis belief that f u-
Bio'n of parties In , opposition to "graft"
is not so likely to be successful as
straight, independent movements aimed
at reform without regard to political
parties. In the absence of President
Wheeler, who is Journeying to the East,
Professor Alexis A. Lange presided at
the university meeting to-day.

eet at rest the fears of those interested
In her â¢welfare by putting in an appear
ance at Sydney. New South Wales, her
destination. She was overdue and rein
surance on her had been advanced to
45 p*T cent. She reached port
eadly crippled and from the c&bled de
scription of the damage inflicted the won
der is that she was not many days longer
completing her trans-Pacific journey.
Sho Tva.s loaded with lumber from Bu
leka and to the nature of her cargo is
probably due the fact that she was able
to reach port at all.
The cablegram reporting her arrival
cays that she had lost her fore, main
and mizzen topmasts and her Jibboom.
It is safe to Eurxnise that in addition to
this ebe sustained considerable damage.

Chilean flag, is owned in this city by the
Charles Nelson Company. She was for
merly the British bark Andromeda.

riÂ«ed;On:
The continuation of the drought in north
ern , California > has extended ; the â¢ area ; of
interference :'\u25a0 with A mining V; operations
largely, since the first mines jtoj be t orced
to shut down, those, in' Nevada! County
in the Nevada City district, ' were closed
for; the lack of ' water.: The Mother Lode
in r varlou*""localities is affected and the
interruption is the most serious that has
taken place' during many : years. \u25a0, The
difficulties experienced by the 7 quartz
ledge miners in such an' emergency are
not common - to the gold:: dredging
panics, which are continuing to r make
hay* while the sun shines along the river
beds.-' ."Â«\A-"^"h^--' -. ' -*' . - '\u25a0'./.. -"\u25a0
The situation now existing accentuates
the wisdom ;of Government"; plans : that
hava been under consideration 'for -some
years . to, store the excess waters ; of the
mountain streams for use {when /there Is
a water, shortage, through the ; construc
tion of I huge" reservoirs |in \u25a0- the mountains.
As the " aaricultural crops are' insured by
irrigation,; so' the gold mining â¢ industry
of California may find an element | of in
surance â¢in a system ; of ; reservoirs that
will ultimately be constructed.
It â¢ Is probable that, rain will soon fall
on; the western slopes of the Sierra Ne
vada mountains, but ;in_* the- meantime
the loss Ito \u0084 the mining industry is very
great. Thousands of miners ; are \u25a0 idle and
others may Join the ranks of the unem
ployed, temporarily,, unless ~ relief -is
speedily afforded. The financial; losses
are running dally into thousands _of dol-;
lars, taking into account the several lo
calities where the stamps have ceased -to
fall. Little is being accomplished at mines
other than to keep, the (pumps going to
prevent the flooding of the properties. * ;\u25a0
The weather is now the ' principal topic
of the mining men along; the J Mother
Lode and also wherever there are placers
that have run dry; The institution of
electric power in the past few. years has
made the damage in -total a little
less â¢ than it would have been
under older conditions, but it .is
severe and will interfere with mining
dividends in the cases of many companies
during the next few months. . .â¢ f
TURNS OUT QUICKSILVER.
The Redding Free Press reports that
the Altoona quicksilver mine in Trinity
County at Cinnabar is turning out $10,000
a month and is handling . six. hundred
tons of ore a month. The mine is oper
ated under a lease. The activity Is like
that of former days at 'Altoona.
A largo increase in mining development
is reported at * Hayden Hill . in Lassen

Hayseed mines are at HaydenHill.

closed two shoots. A 'ledge carrying a
comparatively high' grade \ of ore has
been opened. | Some of the ore runs from
$25 to 530 a ton, according to local re
ports.
The Los Angeles Mining Review re
ports the chances are good that SoUdad
Canyon, all the way: from â¢ Saugua in
Los Angeles County to the Kern Coun
ty line affords an excellent field for the
operations of the gold dredgers. Placer
ground in the vicinity of Saugus has
been worked for ..years, \u25a0 but the amount
of ground is too great to be treated by
the dry washing ( process. ; Moneyed men
are â¢ reported to have interested them
selves in a project to dredge the old
riv,er bed and benches in the Soledad
Canyon.
The South Yuba Mining and Smelting
Company has bought the Virginia : and
Gold Hill and the Martha quartz mines
near French Corral; Nevada County.
The Last Chance mine has been sold by
Goering. : This mine is in; Sierra $ and

against 267,600,000 in . 1904, an increase .: of no

--Some Interesting facts about method!
of placer- mining in Alaska are con
tained in an* article : in the Mining and
Scientific Press, from which the _ fol
lowing extracts are taken:
;: Tbe clearing of * the â¢ gold from the acoom
â¢panylng minerals of hUh specific gravity is
often "very difficult. In the creek workings on
Bonanza Creek, Klondike, for example, of the
total weight â¢of gravel handled, 1 per ! cent of
black sand, mostly magnetite. Is caught with
the gold In the clean-up. In American Creek,
Alaska, the â¢ clean-ups are impeded by - the
presence of . large quantities of barlte pebbles.
In the Fairbanks district red srarneta and ru
tlle, in some cases .in quantity up to one-third
of 1 Der cent of the total material washed,
are caught with the gold. In the Birch Creek
district there Is : enough rutile in ' the aurif er
oua sand to cause trouble la the clÂ«an-up. In
He ward Peninsula the magnetite is In com
paratively small amount. Garnets occur In thÂ»
creek ' diggings ud to five pounds to the cublo
yard of -. gravel;. In .t he beaoh and so-called
"tundra"- gold sands of the coastal plain from
3 per cent up to as high as 61 per cent of gar
nets occur.
The u ae of quicksilver U limited. Even al
lowing ' for the extra expense - and â¢ time con
sumed In the use and recovery of quicksilver.
It is surprising that this Important agency for
caving fine cold la not more \u25a0 generally - em
ployed. - ': 's- â¢ '\u25a0* '
It has been shown that the proportion of fine
gold In the Interior fields Is large. The neglect
to use Quicksilver In attempting to save such
gold can be considered only a pctuiy-wis*
pound-foolish policy. , ..

OUR ASIATIC TRADE.
IT is customary in some quarters to flout; at the trade of this
coast with Asia. There are many men in politics and some in
the professions who persist in not comprehending the relations
of production and commerce to their own interests and welfare.
Some for the sake of votes and office will appeal for support in
behalf of policies that tend directly to the limitation of commerce
and the injury of the producer and laborer. Against such, arid
against the indifference of others, the promoters of commerce have
10 maintain a constant watchfulness. We see this in the 'matter of
promoting American shipping. One section of its opponents oppose
it directly. Another does worse by pretending to favor it, while
proposing conditions that entirely nullify any benefit it could be
to the people interested, who represent not only themselves, but
the vast number who produce our commercial surplus that enters'
into foreign trade.
We have often said, and repeat now, that this coast must look
lo Asia for expansion of its trade. It is our field, as Europe is the
field of the Atlantic seaboard. To occupy it profitably: /we must; in
our international policy, treat the Asiatic nations which are our
reciprocal customers on a plane of perfect equality with the Euro
pean nations who occupy the same position. Unless we "do this,
we go to them with trade handicapped by their feeling that their
rights are held in contempt, and they are (treated unequally among
the nations.
Handicapped in many ways, the trade of this coast with Asia
has vastly increased in the last ten } r ears. Ten years ago its total
was $76,000,000. Last year it was $165,000,000, an increase of more
than 100 per cent. An equal increase in the next decade' will make
it an important part of the foreign trade of the whole country. It is
believed by the best experts in such matters that American .trade
with Asia can within a reasonable time be brought up to an annual
value of $1,000,000,000. The total American trade with Asia now
is $350,000,000 a year, of which this coast has and handles $165,
000,000, or within $10,000,000 of one-half. It is fair to assume that
our continuing enterprise will hold that same proportion of the
expanded trade of the future. Indeed we may expect our proportion
to increase.
What that means to labor and production here requires no
divination to disclose. * In supplying the demands of that market
new industries will arise in California. China cannot raise cotton,
nor can Japan. California can raise it profitably, as has been demon
strated. In the development of that trade our lumber in new forms
will be required, as will the decorticated fiber of several fiber plants
which we can produce. But specification is unnecessary. *An ex
pansion of commerce means the expansion of all industries, for they
all contribute to it.
Twenty years ago the foreign trade of Japan amounted to only
Si per capita. *Now it is $7 per capita. The foreign trade of China
is now less than $1 per capita, but give China internal peace and
freedom from external threats and impudent interference, and in
the next twenty years her trade should expand to a larger sum per
capita than that of Japan, for she is a country of far greater natural
resources. When that nation of 450,000,000 follows the Japanese ex
ample, the world's trade will get its greatest impulse since the
high days of Venice. We should prepare to take our share. The
Asiatic languages should be acquired by young men who want to
do their part in handling that commerce. There will be an unlim
ited demand in China for Chinese who speak English and for Ameri
cans who speak Chinese. The Koreans speak the dialect of Canton,
but the spoken language of Japan differs from the Chinese, and may
be usefully acquired by young men who appreciate the opportunities
of a commercial career.
In the coming contest for the trade of Asia we should omit
no means that will serve our interests. When some men decry this
as "commercialism," they decry the prop that holds up their own
houses. Without commerce a nation lapses, recedes in its civiliza
tion. With commerce it goes forward in civilization. Of this Japan
is a conspicuous example, which China and Korea will follow, and
their advance will be for our commercial advantage, if we are wise
and prepare in time. __
SPARE THE BOULEVARD.
' - - .. \u25a0 . v
Board of Supervisors should not grant nor sell a railroad
I franchise over Nineteenth avenue to the ocean road. While riot
. *\u25a0 officially confirmed, it is confirmed by general understanding
that Nineteenth avenue is to be a boulevard, and as such legally
protected against railroad tracks. The city has acquired by deed of
gift the right of way for a driveway across the Laguna de Merced
rancho, and Nineteenth avenue as a boulevard will be the only con
nection with such driveway. It opens an additional outlet to the
ocean, which is very desirable, and it should not be surrendered to
a railroad.
Admitting the utility of street railroads, prudence and proper
public policy will reserve such thoroughfares as Nineteenth avenue.
This is done in all large cities. The boulevard system of Chicago
is now one of the comforts and facilities of that city. The boule
vards are denied to street railroads, free to the people, open as drives
and promenades to everybody.
The franchise on Nineteenth avenue is sought by promoters of
a real estate scheme laudable in itself, but its value; to the city is
not sufficient to justify the surrender or sale at any price of the
only opportunity we have for a boulevard leading into new scenery
and reaching the ocean beach at a new point.
In Oakland the San Leandro road was formerly practically a
boulevard. It was used extensively as a picturesque driveway. vÃut
it was given over to an electric railroad and spoiled entirely -for the
use it had so long served. The deprivation was so keenly, felt that
the county has made a large appropriation for a scenic boulevard
north of the old road and skirting the foothills". This boulevard is
to be preserved frcm the use of any railroad. We may leanrsome
thing from the experience of our enterprising neighbor across the
bay. If we surrender Nineteenth avenue as a, boulevard and turn
it over to a railroad, the recovery of an equal facility and necessity
will cost us many times what we get out of the railroad., ;,We hope
that the Supervisors will ponder well: these considerations and re
fuse the franchise when it is applied for. r

THE MAGIC
OF PRAISE
ANGELA MORGAN.
THIS is for employers, parents, teach
. era and all others who are charged
with the training or supervision of
human beings. y
Don't find fault with those in your
chaxge^ in the mistaken belief that con
demnation is a greater "spur to achieve
ment than praise. ,:
Don't withhold ah encouraging word
from . a deserving, one, thinking thereby
to stimulate him. to better effort. Whole
some i praise is a greater stimulus to
achievement than condemnation can ever
be..-- \u0084 ,; â¢ .â¢â¢.\u25a0'..,;.;Â».w \u25a0;".-;
I am aware it is the principle of many
practical, sensible business men to \u25a0 em
ploy the negative method of directing and
training others, offering as a reason i the
statement that only by- severe criticism
and fault finding, or, by all ather with
holding expressions of satisfaction, . can
anÂ« employer hope to get ihe best work
from those in his chaÂ«*se. : .
There are teachers, also. -lyho maintain
that to praise a pupil means to spoil him,
and there are parents who, laboring un
der the earnÂ© delusion, very, rarely ap
prove openly of their children's efforts
and achievements. It is amazing how
few of these presumably intelligent per
aons realize that t discrimination \u25a0 should
be used in putting such a principle into
practice. <-\u25a0 . . . .\u25a0..".. .. : .â¢\u25a0.;.' ;,;\u25a0;\u25a0:â¢ \u25a0\u25a0â¢ . -\u25a0- \u25a0
The same treatment that would apply
to one order of. mentality might .prove
utterly disastrous to the' growth and well
being of another order. -^ >
The question of difference in disposition
and temperament plays a most important
part in thlsmatter ot praise, and blame.
The employe, the teacher, or the.parent
should study the dispositions 'of those un
der his or her jurisdiction and be sure
the harsh method "of treatment will be
beneficial before applying it;: should look
closely, and determine . whether, after ajl,
praise might not kindle into ; life certain
qualities /In certain -dispositions which
seem to benefit not at all by censure.
"Whereas blame may. be instruments! in
spurring one man -to. greater., effort, it
may utterly discourage another and par
alyze what powers ho does possess. r
A teacher of music. 'said fto me recently:
"I always study my pupil before deciding
whether to praise him frequently orein
ploy severe criticism in training him. I
find it is a matter of temperament. Con
demnation may be'meat for one pupil and
poison for another.". ' i "
And she is right. There is a certain super;
sensitive, conscientious, introspective, type
of person - that ' is often -disheartened by
the negative . method. I; have known such
persons to be. completely; thrown; out of

A TALK WITH ELXATHAX.
. I heard you say, Elnathan. that you
would never" marry a- girl unless -she
was beautiful, pure, .bright, witty, edu
cated, refined, a gcod housekeeper, -fitted
to shine in society, tasteful In dress, eco
nomical, and several other excellent
things that I forget at-this moment.
This is what you said, Elnathan. and
it makes me tired ! We will not mince
matters, my boyâ and It really did make
me very tired!- .
Who are you that you dare look upon
a beautiful, talented and pure girl and
even dream of possessing: her? You are
but moderate " in intellect, and the Al
mighty, has forbidden you to be anything
else; you will "pass tne crowd." if the
crowd Is large enough; you are just about
as decent, and not more so, as the rest of
the fellows â¢in your setâ and I toss no
bouquet at you in saying it.
And yet, against feminine wit and grace
you would set your gross commonness,
and you would match her purity withâ
that which you are, and I need not tell
you .what it is! 'Elnathan; If I had
your ," nerve" I never would be compelled
to pawn .my winter overcoat. ,
If you Insist marrying a girl who
is all that you say. she must be, you had
better straightway 1 take your nose out
of the trough if you do not wish to make
her mightily unhappy, -for a good woman
can -imagine 'that * a seventeen-ounce

The fooJ that made the fathers strong

"I was raised in the South, where hot
biscuits, griddle-cakes, pies and puddings
arc eateu at almost every meal, and by
the time I located jn Nebraska I fouud
myjclf a sufferer from : indigestion and
its attendant illsâ distress and pains aftsr

"I was rapidly becoming incxpacltaled
for business, when a valued friend sug-
gested a change in ray diet, the abandon-
ment of heavy, rich stuff and the use of
Grape-Nuts food. I followed tha go^d
advice and shall always be' thankful that
I did so. \
â¢Whatever may be the experience of
others, the beneficial effects of the change
v.*ere apparent in my case almost immedi-
ately. My Etomach, which had rejected, ;
other food for so long, took to Grape-
Nuts most kindly; in a day or two my
headaches were gone. I began to sleep

the scales \u25a0 showed that â¢my lost . welgnt

FORM PLANS
FOR GETTING
FEERAL AID
Congressional^ Delegation
Confers With. Committee of
the Elver Association Ee
garding the Sacramento
WANT STEEAM MADE
MOEE NAVIGABLE
Governiiient Will Be Asked
to Help California in Main
taining Clear Waterway;
for the State's Commerce
Before departing for the scene of their
labors at Washington, the Congressional
delegation with the exception of Congress
men Gillett and Daniels met at the Palace
Hotel yesterday afternoon in conference
â¢with the executive committee of the River
Improvement and Drainage Association
of California, for the purpose of discuss
ing the best means of laying before Con
gress the cetitlon for an appropriation to
make the Sacramento River more navi
gable.
During the afternoon it was brought
out that there Is no certainty that the
rivers and harbors bill will be brought
before the coming session of Congress, in
which event the labor of preparing a peti
tion and working for an appropriation
would go for naught.. Should the bill,
however, come before the Congressional
body, the executive committee was in
vited to send a. delegation to assist the
Congressional delegation in its efforts Xo
obtain Federal aid in the State's improve
ment of its main waterway.
Should the discussion of the jivers and
harbors bill be deferred until a year
from the coming session, the River Im
provement Association was urged by the
representatives to send a delegation to
the national congress or the River As
sociations of the United States' to be held
at Washington during the coming winter,
to aid in securing from the Federal Gov
ernment an appropriation in proportion
to the needs of one of the most vital
sinews of the country.
Senator Perkins first asked an expres
sion of opinion from. John W k Ferris,
whose practical experience as a river en
gineer was taken as a basis for the dis
cussion of the Sacramento's needs. Mr.
Ferris told of the pro rata share of ex
pense that the State had engaged to
bear, the organization of the land owners
on the river in charing the expense, and
the important point of aid from, the Gov
ernment.
ESSENTIAL FEATURES.
He said that although the essential fea
ture on the Sacramento was the naviga
bility of* the river, still means must be
provided for the carrying off of the flood
because of the deteriorated channel from
the entrance of the Feather River to the
mouth of the Sacramento. He said that
in this eighty miles not less than one
hundred and eighty million cubic yards
of debris had accumulated, and that the
river's flow| was thereby reduced from
forty to fifty per cent.
Mr. Ferris urged that the Government
place the river in condition and the State
supplement the work. In response to
questions tiy Senator Perkins, he asserted
that reclaimed lands during seven out of
eight years would greatly increase the
wealth of the State. He assured Senator
Perkins that the swamp-reclaimed dis
tricts wers willing to bear their share
of the expense.
He attributed the present condition of
the river to the use of hydraulic mining
and claimed that the Government was
liable, as it permitted the causes, and it
was fair to ask it to repair the damages.
He said that $24,000,000 would make the
river more navigable and part of this
amount would be borne by the private
landowners and the State.
Senator Perkins assured the speaker
that the Congressional delegation! was in
full accord with his sentiments, but the
question lay in convincing. Congress. He
called for a feasible plan whereby the
Representatives might be assisted in
their plea for an appropriation.
Congressman McLachlan, who is a
member of the Rivers and Harbors
Committee, spoke of the opposition ot
Congressman Burton of Kansas, who is
chairman of the committee in the House.
He attributed the Congresman's preju
dice to past disappointments in the uso
of national appropriations in California.
He said the Government's consideration
was commerce and felt it to be a question
as to whether the demand for an appro
priation should be made.
NAVIGATION" THE OBJECT.
Congressman McLachlan said that if
the Government adopted a policy of* car
ing for the tidewaters of rivers the ex
pense would never end. The principle
of j the Government is, he explained, :to
look after navigation and not to attend
to the reclamation of private lands.
Even thie appropriations for the Missis
sippi are for navigation and their use for
leveos Is winked at by Congress because
the river is an interstate waterway.-'
Representative McLachlan then told of
the paltry appropriation for rivers and
harbors compared with the funds .: set
aside for army and navy and said that a
national association is planning to meet
at Washington during the winter to pe
tition for adequate appropriations. Ho
urged the local association to send a dele
gation vto this convention and was assured
by Ruf us P. Jennings that arrangements
were already: afoot for a California dele
gation to the convention.
Mr. McLachlan said that everything
would hinge upon the report of the army
engineers, who met ~ here a year . ago
and whose report will be presented to
Congress at the next Bession. Should
that report be adverse to the Govern
ment's lending Â§ aid to this . State, , the
speaker said ho believed that no appro
priation could be obtained. He closed
with an appeal to the association to; send
Its ablest and wisest men to Washington
to present Uhe petition to- Congress. ; .
- Congressman -rMcKinlay,' Congressman
Hayes and Congressman Kann indorsed
the statements of their colleague, V Mc-
Lachlan. and f urged . that no > expense \u25a0be
spared to agitate the matter. :
Senator ' Flint promised his support to
the 'petition, but : expressed : doubt^ as to
the possibility of securing an,appropria
tion except for : obtaining better navi
gation along the river. .He said: the" ques
tion had â¢; . resolved . itself , into .three
branches. .First, the irrigation of the up
per watershed of the Sacramento to* re
lieve ' the lower, river from the pressure
of winter â¢ rains; second, the j reclamation*
of the swamp and overflow lands, by 4 pri
vate owners; . and . third, the ; cleaning out
of the lower, river beds from Impediments
to the water flow and the betterment; 6l
navigation.

FOOTBALL
BERKELEY FORM
SEEMS HIGHEST
Team Appears to the Eyes
of an Expert in Slightly
Better .Shape Physically
FAST GAME EXPECTED
One of the Greatest Grid
iron Struggles Ever Seen
in State Should Besult
PARK WINSLOW.
When the great football teams of
University of California and Stanford
University line up for the annual bat
tle on the campus at Palo Alto to-day
there will be little or no chance for
even the wisest to pick a sure winner.
The blue and gold has a trifle the best
of the argument on form, but the fa
vorite does not always win. This is
particularly true of struggles between
nearly even elevens for gridiron cham
pionships. Both teams will fight for
every drop of blood there is in them
to the bitter end. Two years ago Cali
fornia was generally picked to win by
a large score. On that fateful day the
cardinal would have won the game had
It not been for the prowess of "Heine' :
Heitmuller.
California appears to be in a little
better shape physically for to-day's
contest than her opponents. Illness and
accidents have kept a varsity end and
a varsity fullback from playing for the
cardinal.
Some of the other pupils of James
Lanagan are reported suffering from
sore spots. California will not have
one injured man in the original line
up, and the men will be those whom
Coach Knibbs considers the best eleven
in the big university at Berkeley.
To-day's game is of more than usual
importance because It will demonstrate
In a measure the efficacy of bringing
modern Eastern football to the Pacific
Coast. California relies on Knibbs,
who represents the "'Dartmouth sys
tem." Lanagan has a system which has
not yet been christened. The first Is
able to teach all that Dartmouth knew
last year. JLanagan is able to instruct
in only those features which he has
learned by observation and by word of
mouth. The one is credited with being
a man of great football efiucation, the
other with being a genius of the grid
iron.
DARTMOUTH SYSTEM EXPLAINED.
The "Dartmouth system" is not at
all mysterious, as many people seem
Inclined to think. It is simply hard,
last play, with every man in every evo
lution. No team survives on its tricks.
When teams are evenly matched a trick
may sometimes win, but deceptions ol
the football field are not consistent
ground gainers. Those who think the
â¢Dartmouth system" is a series of
tricks will be sadly mistaken. Every
team has its own little secret plays
which sometimes work and sometimes
do not. The "Dartmouth system" is
more team work than anything else.
Lanagan's pupils also know a few
tricks, which will be tried in to-day's
contest. Stanford may, as usual be
depended upon to try her favorite
quarterback run. Lanagan's system is
a modification of Harvard's style of
play, pieced together with fragments
from here, there any everywhere. His
principle strength is his ability to in
still a spirit fo obedience and endeavor
into his men. The boys seem to work
harder and more faithfully for him
than other football players do for other
coaches. . -
THE WAY THEY LINE UP.
At both ends California is much
stronger with Kittrelle and Elliott
than is Stanford with Lyons and Koer
ner. Not only do the blue and gold
men get down the field faster, but they
are surer and more aggressive. Hor
ton will / give Force all the work he
can attend to at one tackle and Craw
ford is stronger than his opponent.
Bush, at the other. Thompson of
Stanford is superior to Stern at one
guard and Gray of California is as
much superior to Frizzell at the other.
Molfino is one of the best centers I
have ever seen on the football field
and Is certain te surpass Haffey in
spite of the lat'ter's superior weight.
The best center that ever stepped on a
gridiron was Lewis of Harvard and
he was nearly as light as Molfino.
Back of the line California is bet
ter than Stanford. The blue and gold
backfield is faster and shows greatly
superior team play. When it comes to
individuals, Stott Is better than Whit
man and Chalmers the equal of any of
his opponents. The cardinal quarter
eometimfea shows a lack of Judgment.
however. Dole and Vandervoort are
not equal to Sperry and Snedigar. I
expect that Chalmers will gain about
the same amount of ground as Sperry,
but his associates will probably not
equal the rival pair. Mead is a splendid
line bucker and may be depended upon
to represent his university with much
honor. The strength of California's
backs Is reduced somewhat by a lack
of certainty on the part of the linemen
In opening holes.
In team play I should say California
Is again superior. On punting both
teams are about equal. Whoever wins,
the thousands who take the train lor
Palo Alto to-day will witness one of
the greatest games that the Pacific
Coast has ever seen. Who knows but
-what it may be the last of the present
style of football? "Rah, rah. rah, Cali
fornia!" "Give* em the ax, Stanford!"

A FINE SPIRIT
California has no excuses to

fine fettle and we have no crip
ples to put on the field a* vre .

that elves me great pleasure is
the fine spirit shown lÂ»y the
men. I have never seen in all
my football experience a team
vrith greater unanimity. Coach
KnlhbM r.nd Dr. Griffin won
the hearts of the men front the
start and they have worked un
der their directions With -a
willingness that is cheering.
We have a team that should
put up a great fight. There are
but four old varsity men on the
team. The j rest were substi
tutes last year. : In ' last . year's

estimation of Coach ; Knibbs. That Is
why, on the . eve of the^ great gridiron
contest with the rival university at
Palo Alto, .there Is predominating in
Berkeley a .spirit that Coach Knibbs
has communicated to the - California
teamâ a spirit* that insists upon re
garding football as serious; business,â
and the most serious part of.lt all, the
vow that Stanford must be^defeated on
her" own fleld : to-morrow afternoon, "in
the presence of the.leglonto^blue* and
gold adherents "and of the "cardinal. "

uncertainty of the weather at this time

all but the finals as soon as possible.
So far the matches have been neither
close nor particularly interesting. A.
good match was "expected when Perejf

Grant . Smith and . Frank Mitchell. The Jp
strong wind which prevailed made "-itjp^
almost Impossible to play good tennis/
and the match was consequently devoid
of. "feature. Smith and Mitchell got
the balls back and Murdock and Craw
ford'', did the missing 1 , particularly the
latter. Mitchell played the best 1 tenni3 "
of the four, which Is not saying much.
The remaining matches will undoubt- .
edly prove Interesting, as .the five
teams - are "evenly matched. The * first
match of the day will be between the

Stanford alumni made merry at a down

They were gathered there from many
fciaies. men who had Juet dropped into
San Francisco for the evening, and who
were on ibeJr way to cheer their team to
\ a toiy in >the one great intereolle*. iate
football same of the year. This game
baa such a pull on the heart strings of
<. \u0084:kge men and women that it draws
thrni back to their alma mater and that
rr.e struggle, even though they must
cross mountains lo reach the gridiron.
\Vi;h tlicm were graduate San Francis
cars. They were gathered there from
every i-iass, the bearded *95er and the
youngster who received his sheepskin
last May with the class of '05. They
r.ore a 5l there. They fought over to-day's
game many limes. They-Â»told of the
â¢good old days" when Downing and Kick
en and Murphy and Cotton were the
Fia:s and made magnificent runs for
touchdowns and stopped the Berkeley
re> ti by fierce tackles. All this was re
cited and much- more, and every time the
\u2666 nthusiasm seemed likely to burst within
tbe breasts cf the members of the alumni
the Stanford yell would ring out so loud
tr.at ihe walls shook back the echo.
The prettiest feature of the evening was
the singing of the Stanford hymn. While
the orchestra played the air this c.owu
of old-time college men rose in their
p!a<es and proudly sang their beloved
toiler. At its end the applause from the

BETTIXG IS dLITE LIGHT.
Collrsr Wen Place ..Smalt Wafers, With
California a Stronff Favorite, f
Little betting has been done on the
Stanford-California football game of
to-day. Football is, of. course, such a
jturely amateur sport that little bet-
ting is done in the professional sense,
admirers of the teams generally plac
ing a small bet at even money on their
favorite eleven. This year's betting has
been light so far. for the reason that
the game Is held on the Stanford cam
pus and the men from Palo Alto have
not made their pilgrimage to San Fran
cisco, as was their wont in former days.
There was some money bet in the
downtown resorts yesterday, with Cali
fornia the favorite at 10 to 8 and'lo to
7. The Stanford men are holding back
for 2 to 1, and It Is likely they will get
It before the game begins. College en
thusiasm counts for much In football
betting and yesterday several followers
of California were wagering even
money that their team would defeat.
Stanford by two touchdowns. A num
ber of small bets were made.
Betting will not be allowed on the.
Stanford campus.
"Rooters' * Hats la Dispute.
BERKF.LEY. Nov. 10. â Joseph Ko
ford, chairman of the rally committee
nl the ptudejjt body, issued a statement
to-night intended to allay the fears of
those who have fancied that in paying
70 cents for a "rooters' " hat they have
been duped into giving more than was
required. The committee arranged
with a firm to supply nearly 600 of
these 'rooters' " hats for 6w cents
Â«pfece, to be sold to the "rooters" for 75
cents. The profit was to go to the rally
committee to pay the legitimate ex
penses incurred in arranging: for the
rallies.
A stir resulted from the sale yester
â¢fijy by an x Oakland dealer of hats ap
f jpsarently identical with the "rooters' "
jfliatÃ at 50 cents- apiece. The university
students feared that somebody had been
deceived if the Oakland man could sell
the hats for &0 cents apiece which they
had paid 7Â» cents apiece for.
SO strenuous were the protests that
Mr. Koford of the rally committee made
his statement to-night, in which he
showed how the rally committee had
been enabled to raise funds by provid

to-tlay distributed affidavits on the
campus* proving: that the hats cost it
C 2 cents, so that the university commit

at cost. Tho Oakland tradesman admit
ted, according 1 to Koford, that in selling
the hats for fO cents he lost money on
them, and wtth these facts in possession
of the undergraduates the excitement

We will win because we have
eleven men who are 4 in superb
condition. I have never neen a

such Rood spirits. We are not
eonfldent to over-confidence,
but with the perfect team
'work that has been drilled into
us by the unceasing: efforts of
Laaagan and Dansbach in the
last fvro weeks I don't see bow
we can fall.. Barring: the in

little. Xeltber of these men
will be permitted to enter the

Of course this will cripple the

STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Nov. 10.â
"We cannot and we will; not lose," is the
spirit of the Cardinal community. , "By
what possibility can ' California expec^

nine veterans?" "Who cares for theso

and enthusiastic stand is 'expressed at

"Where is California superior to the
Cardinal?" "Surely not in team work!"

Southern Pacific Excursion
Tickets to Palo Alto Can
Be Bought Only Up Town
BUSES AT UNIVERSITY
Visitors Will Be Transported
to the Campus Grounds,
Where They Can Get Lunch
In view of the fact that the Third and
Townsend depot is so 111 arranged for the
accommodation of a great number of pas
sengers who wish to buy tickets on an
excursion trip such as to-day's to Palo
Alto will be, the Southern Pacific offi
cials have positively declared that the
excursion - tickets good on its special
trains to-day will be sold only at - 612
Market street. 52S Market street. Univer
sity Club, Stanford Club and the Univer
sity of California Club. Under no con
ditions will any excursion tickets be sold
at the Third and Towrtsend streets sta-,
tion. It will be well for all who Intend
witnessing the greatest college game of
the year to bear in mind this fact about
the selling of the excursfon tlcket3.
The Southern Pacific Company has only
150 cars set aside to handle the immense
crowd that will journey to Palo Alto.
The first special train will leave at 8:15
a. m- Other special trains will follow at
9:15, 10:15, 10:43. 10:55, TUB and 11:60 In the
morning and others will leave at 12:03 and
12:15 p. m. Each train will make two
trips/ starting back for this city as soon
as it deposits Us passengers at Palo
Alto.
The excursion tickets will nat be good
on any of the regular tralns.but the reg
ular trains will carry passengers to Palo*
Alto'at the regular rates.
At Palo Alto the buses will be at hand
to take the crowds tc' the football field,
nearly a mile awa// It will be well for
ev?ry one to get'an early start, for the
cap'&7ity of ' the buses is limited. Tho
train "Â».;rvicp," too, is likely to be Insuffi
cient' If ~* me crowd watts until the last
minute to leave the city.
Many spectators will make the trip to
Palo Alto in automobiles. For the first
time the university authorities will per
mit these machines to enter the' campus
grounds. Entrance must be made through,
the east gate, below the main avenue, and
the automobiles may proceed close to the
field.
Preparations are being made to provide
luncheon for the crowd at Stanford. The
University dining rooms will be open to
visitors. In addition the managers of
Rtfble Hall, the young ladles' dormitory,
will serve a buffet luncheon under the
trees Just east of the Quadrangle.
The return trip on the railroad can be
made immediately after the close of the
game. The trains will be run out of Palo
AUo every few minutes .and the empty,
cars sent back to make up new trains.
It is here that a congestion of the crowd
will likely occur, for the facilities for
handling crowds at the Palo Alto station
are inadecuate. Many of the University\
visitors will remain during the evening to
witness a Stanford production of "The*
Beauty Shop," which will be given as the
regular football show. *
Will Entertain the Poe Brothers.
The University of Princeton Club will
give an informal smoker" to-night in the
banquet hall at Talt's. The guest 3 of
honor will be the Poe brothers; who
are here to referee the game at Stan
ford to-day.
All those who have attended Prince
ton have been invited to participate In
the entertainment to-night, which will
begin at 9 o'clock.

.Lf NEW YOIUK, Nov. 10.â The rate for call
"^, leans weot to 15 per cent avaln to-day, and
the estimates of the losses In cash by the
banks tor the week on the currency movement
ran from $5.000,000 to nearly $10,WX000. Nev
ertheless stocks showed effective resistance to
pressure end later in the day developed ag
eTesslve strength. The conductors of the spec
ulative eperatfe-ns for an advance seemed to
Jtave come to a concerted determination to ig
jnore- thÂ« etringency in the money market ' as
en Influence en sentiment and to pay the pre
vailing rate for day to day loans and hold
their etockE. In the active discussion of the
money situation, which went on all day, much
was heard of a claim or a complaint that the
apparent stringency in the money market was
the result cf manipulation and was designed
â¢ife-ainst important speculative pools In special
stocks. The comparative tranquillity ol other
' df aartisent* of the money markets was point
ed to as corroborative of this view. It was a
view that old not rec<>4ve much countenance
In banking' circles or outside speculative circles
about the Stock Exchang-e. A declin* of $&,000,
000 to $10,000,000 within a wÂ«>k in the cash
holdings of thÂ« banks, with the surplus reserve
at the beginning- of that period down to $2,354,
275, while speculative borrowing continued into
this week ra an attempted extension- of opera
tfr>nf for the advance at some points, teems
sufficient explanation fcr the necessity on the
jiaxt ef ths banks to curtail loans. It is by no
means unusual for interest rates for a commer
cial purpose to be held down to a 6 per cent
1 ate In the midst of violent flurries in the
call money market on the Stock Exchange. The
precedent of 16 pÂ«r cent quoted on call money
at the Stock Exchange in December, 1839,
while^ six per cent ruled for time loans and
for mercantile paper, is the most striking ex
ample. It is this comparative tranquillity of
commercial interest rates that 1b offered to
explain the reluctance of the Secretary of the
Treasury to take any measures for the relief
of the money market, to far as the purely
rpeculatlve needs are concerned. The -week's
operations of the backs with the Sub-Treasury
alone show a loss of $5,127,000. The high rate
for money Is an effective barrier against for
eign pressure for funds upon Xew % York and
foreign exchange made a further wide decline
to-day. This was in spite of a hardening of
* discounts In Paris and Berlin. Offerings of
hackers' bills in the exchange market against
leans placed In the money market wss the
principal factor In the weakness of exchange.
The attractive level of money rates â¢was eald
to have Induced large offerings from outside
centers and for account of corporations 'and
capitalist* at different points In the -country.
The calling cf loans en the part cf'the local
banks, however, kept \ip the rate most of the
time above 11 per cent. Foreign markets were
<lscourased again by the Russian troubles, as
shown by the fall In Russian bonds. There-
Teas no further transfer of currency to the In
terior through the Su'rj-Treasury to-day. : and
this had some rood effect en rentlment.. It
â¢was points ont in this connection that the
Government Institution thus far In November
tias already transferred f3,45f>.000 to the Inte
rior, compared with a total for the^ whole cf
last November of ?4, 730.000. ThÂ« activity of
the stock market diminished a (rood deal in
the late Sealing*, but there werÂ» only smalt
concessions from the best prleee, and the
closing was fairly steady.
Bonds were Irregular. Total rales, par value,
$3,220,000. .

prevailed throughout the entire session, Selling
was active and general the greater part of the
day At times the bull leaders supported the
market openly by liberal purchases, but efforts
of 'this sort caused only small temporary rallies.
Commission houslfer^Mle fair buyers at Inter
vals, .were, CQmjÂ£TVJ<Â£tq execute, numerous Bell-
InV Orders' for 'stop ;loss account, adding ma
terially to the. weakness. . Interest centered 'in
the " enormous shipments of wheat . from j Argen

LLOYD DENIES CHARGES
3LIDE BY LEVY HEIRS
Attorney Asserts Allegations
of Undue Influence Are
Not Based on Fact.
Reuben H. Lloyd filed answer yesterday
to the suit instituted against him by the
alleged heirs of the late Isabella Levy to
pet aside deeds to property valued at
about $1,000,000. conveyed to Lloyd by Mrs.
Levy in consideration of the many acts
of kindness extended to her by him.
In his answer Mr. Lloyd admits that
the property was conveyed to him as
stated, but he firmly denies that he se
cured the conveyances through the exer
cise of undue Influence. He reiterates his
aeseitlon that at the time he effected a
compromise with the claimants, or, rath
er, as he puts it. made them a gift, an
aunt of the deceased, a Mrs. Weill, was
living, and that if a successful contest to
the conveyances were waged she, and not
the claimants, would fall heir to the en
tire estate. He further pleads that the
action is barred by .the statute of limita
tions.
Mr. Lloyd is represented . by Attorneys

and his partner. W. S. Wood;

SECRET SERVICE' MEN
CONSULT WITH: JUDGES
Question of Fraudulent Nat
uralization Is Fully
Discussed.
United States Secret Service Agents
Helms and Taylor held an extended
consultation yesterday afternoon with
Judges Graham, Sloss, Troutt, Dunne
and Lawlor to 'devise ways and means
to acquaint the court with the-- names
of those persons whose citizenship pa
pers have been canceled by the Govern
ment and to provide for the readmis
sion of such as may be entitled to the
rights of citizenship at this time. \u0084 /
As a quorum of the court was not
present, no definite action was taken,
except that the secret service men
agreed to send a list of the men whose
papers had been . canceled to each, of
the Judges for their 'guidance should
they, again 'appear for naturalization.
The question of the readmlssSon of
those whose papers have been canceled
was left In abeyance, the Judges re
questing the secret service agents to
submit suggestions as to the best
methods to be pursued.
Upon motion of Judge Troutt It was
agreed that all Judges not present
should be notified of the action taken
and requested to attend another meet
ing that will be arranged in the near
future.
At the next meeting, it is probable
that favorable action; will be taken on
Judge Graham's suggestion that, in the
future the testimony taken upon appli
cations for admission to citizenship be
transcribed' and .made of records It is
believed - that this plan will go far
toward - preventng . fraud ; - and \u25a0 lay the
foundation - for the -prosecution on- a
charge of forgery of any person 'giving
false evldence*upon such, applications.

REGORDIS AGAINST SIIf
Trying to Weld a Chain of
Circumstances That Will
Fasten Murder Upon Man
; The police, think that in James Mor'
rissey, ; alias James Dooley, they; have
the '-. man - who ' fatally shot Patrick \ Mc-
Laughlin %in \~. his â¢ saloon \u25a0 at }] Beale p: and
Bryant \u25a0 streets on Wednesday ; night and
that, the motive was : robbery." Morris
sey was : arrested ; by Detectives Conlan
and \u25a0 McGowan.; He \u25a0 was found [ in a room
on - Howard ' street ' near Third 'on ) Thurs ;
day;' night,-} and 'J locked .' up. Two Mother
men, John Reynolds and Â« Edward c Wise,
who ; were?, in : the room ,wlth '\u25a0< him; .\were
also' arrested as : a matter ; of ; precaution,
but i the! police say; they had \u25a0 nothing to
do "\u25a0 with -the ;crime.
, Morrissey was seen around the neigh
borhood of .the â¢ saloon late Wednesday
afternoon and he answers the ; descrip
tion; of .the ;\u25a0 tall man who was seen
ning t; away. \ from : the saloon "i by John
Devlin after the shot was fired. ' Devlin
thought -the man-was about . 6 feet 'tall.
Morrisse'y, is 5 feet, 10% inches, but owing
to' his. thinness he looks, taller. The police
are still looking for \ two ' men ; who . were
In thÂ« saloon at the time of the shooting.
The record of Morrissey is against \u25a0 him.
He was : arrested In 1902 on a ., charge^ of
robbery, - but it was reduced to " petty
larceny ' and he was sentenced { to :: serve
six months In the , County :' Jail. | On
March 3 ; last he was sentenced "to serve
a ' similar term , for \ petty; larceny and
acted \u25a0 as - a "trusty" in the ':\u25a0 CityJ Prison^
The charge was; for stealing \u25a0 eight , re
volvers f rom : the training ; ship j Marion. >,
"In February last a grocery;, at I Fremont
and Harrison streets was entered by three
burglars.;-?- Policeman Helms \ heard .: a
noise, in | the grocery, and when , he began
to ;: '.; investigate J the burglars .ran ;\u25a0.-.* out.
Helms pursued Frank Hawley and shot
him V ln;; the;, foot t as v he was' climbing- a
fence. -A â¢ week : later Detectives Conlon
and McGowan found Hawley.; lnV Morris-,
sey's room on Third street, near, Bryant,
with"' his foot bandaged. Hawley; and
Morrissey. were â¢ arrested and ; Hawley was
charged with ' burglary, but . was ' allowed \
to ; plead ' guilty to petty larceny and â¢ got
six months in the County Jail.: Morrissey,
was detained for some days t and dis
charged, although It was believed he iwas
one of Hawley's companions. .When Con
lon:; and McGowan searched
room they; found a revolver, Â»whlch was
later identified as one that " had been
stolen from the Marion.
\u25a0When Morrissey was questioned yester
day by : Captain Burnett , he admitted that
he was in the' neighborhood of Beale ana
Bryant* streets about 4 o'clock ; on -Wed
nesday afternoon, but not later. He'said
he .was ; drinking that day and . did not
recollect where he was at 7:30 o'clock, the
time? of-; thej shooting. He> said he had
never been in McLaughlin's ; saloon in his
life, and never carried or. owned a revol
.ver." :''/' ' /'.' \u25a0. \u25a0'.
The. finding of a revolver; in his i room
last February that was I stolen ; from the
Marlon ; contradicts ;-thatV statement;'^ A
singular 7 fact I also, is \ that s the~j bullet | ex
tracted -i from ; Mclaughlin's "Nbody*^ Is .Â» of

TO BEGIN WORK
ON THE LIBRARY
Supervisors Authorize Trus
tees to Proceed With the
Erection of the Structure
The Joint .'- Supervisors' Committee on
Finance and -Public .Utilities yesterday re
ported In ! favor, of an ordinance au thorlz
ing h the : Public ) Library Trustees . to pro
ceed ; with * the ; erection , and equipment ' of
the new Public ' Library."
i Public Library .Trustee Taylor, addressed
the * committee relative Ao the submission
of an architecturarplan" ln*" detail* of the
library ;. building, .which is to be erected
on "Western Addition 7. block -73. Taylor
said the plan showed the . Interior
arrangement of the building and the kind
of material that is to enter; into its con
struction. Taylor, said the architects, un
der the competitive scheme, would not be
restricted to the plan submitted,
alternative plans could be adopted in or-,
der to secure the building best suited for
library purposes.' Taylor asked the - com
mittee to \u25a0 recommend ;an ordinance au
thorizing the :\u25a0 Library .Trustees ; to erect
and equip the Public Library building,
and the clerk was directed to prepare the |
necessary ordinance, which will be passed
to: print ' next \u25a0 Monday.
: The ' Jolnt> committee also had under
consideration { the /off er i of . Mrs. . Margaret
Mee'to sellalot at'the corner of Joseph
ine and Point Lobos avenues for $15,000,
and . that of : Mrs. E. \u25a0 Cutler and Adolph
Meyer to sell a lot' at the northeast . cor
ner "of Gearys and Baker , streets as a ; site
for; the car; and power house of the pro
posed â¢ municipal Geary street road.
J. B. Seeley urged the commlitee to buy
for; $28,000, two: sites at 'the northeast and
northwest -.corners of '\u25a0 Geary, and Broder
ick streets,: respectively, for ; a ' car barn
and a power, housed which, he said, would
be if a' cross-town ' car line
were built on' Broderick street.' ; Stut said
a 1a 1 cross-town:; line .would .be" desirable In
connection -with the 1 Geary road.
Brandensteln thought the suggestion was
of sufficient importance Ito .warrant" a . de
lay of a week or two^ in*order; to secure a
report "from Engineer:; Stut .on the^two
sites mentioned, in the event that a cross
town i line ; Is j decided ; upon.' The * matter
. was t then postponed until " next Friday
afternoon; ; when Stut^wlll ! also i report on
the cost of foundations on the sites.
