RUSSIA PREPARES TO INVADE KOREA;
ARTILLERY GUARDING THE BRIDGES
PORT ARTHUR, Feb. Â£ â All the railroad bridges are guarded, and bridges over the Sungari River are defended
by infantry, artillery and boats. A military post has been established on the highway from Liangyang to Antung, in
anticipation of an advance toward Korea. The railway is almost entirely at the disposal of the commissariat, in order to al
low the free passage of troops later, when their movement is urgent.

Little Doubt That Gould Is the Con

Frwcim! Virpttch to Th* Ca.ll
SALT LAKE, Feb. 5.â TJiere is no
Icnstr any doubt here that George
ciou'd's drecm of controlling a trans
continental railroad from oeeaa to
ocean is about to be realized. It is
practically conceded that Gould is the
directing genius behind the V.'estern
Pacific, which yesterday filed a mort
gage to secure, bends for JiiO.OOO.OOO pre
liminary to beginning active operations.
There are many things that point to
tiould as the controlling power of the
new iin**, winch is to give San Fran
cisco and Salt Lake another connecting
railroad. Gould's chief consulting en
gineer, Virgil G. Bogue. has directed
the work of the many surveyors who
for more than a year past have been
f :;gage3 in laying out the route of the
lea.t from Salt Lake to the coast.
Other men identified close!? with the
Gould interests have had a hand in the
j-reliminary proceeding?. In preparation
for the coming- of the 'Western Pacific,
Gould's Rio Grande system recently
asked for franchises for additional
Hack room. 1 dopot sites and a site for
large shops in this city.
SURVEY IS COMPLCTED.
The work of the surveyors is said to
be practically complete, and actual
construction is expected to begin with
in a very short time. So far everything
connected with the enterprise has
moved quietly, but swiftly and ef
fectively, ample capital being in evi
dence for all purposes.
The plans for the line between this
city and San Francisco include a pro
ject of bridging Great Salt Lake at
s< me point, supposed to be at the
Eouthnestern end of the lake. A grade
probably will be constructed through
Itie shallow waters. Soundings and
surveys have been made for a cut-ofÂ£
across the lake in the vicinity of Gar
field, along the â¢ lines of the Ogden-
Lucin cut-off, but nothing has been de
cided on this point, as the experience
cf the Southern Pacific with the quick-
Fsnds and quagmires has not been en
couraging.
ROUTE TO BE FOLLOWED.
The route of the Western Pacific from
Salt Lake to San Francisco after leav
ing th* lake runs through Skull Valley
and crossei Cedar Mountains and the
Great American Desert, thence running
via Dutch Mountain to Ruby Lake. To
this :>oint there are no engineering dif
ficulties, the maximum grade' being IK
per cent! At Narrow Gap Pass the line
crosses the Eureka and Palisade Rail
road, a feeder of the Southern Pacific.
It crosses the Reese River at Jacobs
viilc and the Fhoshone range at New
Pass. Thence it will descend Into the
Ilumboldt Valley and pass to the north
cf CarsoTl Lake. From Wadsworth,
where the Southern Pacific will be
crossed, the grado rises to Beckwith
Pass, seventy m:l<<= distant. Thence the
road will follow the Feather River in
California.
Tho total length will be about SO0
mi'es. A country immensely rich in
minerals wiiT be onenr-d.
Skull Valley, which contains quartz
deposits of high srade. has never been
developed heretofore owing to the im

HAVANA, Feb. 5.â President Palma's
decree increasing the rates of customs
duties was promulgated to-day and
will take effect to-morrow.
The new rates are considered more
favorable to European importers than
to American. The latter hoped that a
30 per cent increase, which is the maxi
mum rate allowed by Congress, would
have been placed on goods like linens,
which the United States cannot manu
facture in competition with Europe, but
which they could hope to substitute to
some extent with cotton. The Ameri
cans also hoped for a more radic;iJ in
crease in the duties on cottons, \\Tiich
would have enabled goods from the
United States to compete, with the ad
vantage of reciprocity, against British
and European cottons. The President's
decree fixes the increase on linens, silks
and woolens at 15 per cent and that on
cotton at 20 per cent. â K
Under President Palma's decree the
maximum increases of 20 per cent are
placed on all the main food imports
from the United States, among these
being poultry, game, hams, fresh meats
of all kinds, butter, cheese, eggs, all
grains, flour, vegetables and fruits.

NET LOSS
TO SCHWAB
ENORMOUS
Shipyard Trust Set
. dement Costs Him
â  $12,000,000.
NEW, YORK, Feb. 5. â All interests
in the United States Shipbuilding im
broglio are now -taking a breathing
spell. Complete assent to the new plan
foripeace is not yet positively assured.
The foreclosing of the New York Se
curity and Trust Company's mortgage
for $10,000,000 and the Mercantile
Trust Company's mortgage for $16,
000,000 will wipe off the slate two
great incumbrances on the properties.
In this connection Wall street began
to figure to-day what Schwab loses by
the reorganization plan, as compared
with the original Sheldon reorganiza
tion plan of last May. figuring his
9,000,000 shares of preferred stock at
75 gives $6,750,000 and his common
6,000.000 at 25 yields $1,500,000, mak
ing a total of $8,250,000. His Bethle
hem plant, which under the new plan
he turns over to the reorganizes, rep
resents a purchase price of $7,246,000,
on which there is accumulated interest
on his investment of $500,000 for
twelve months and^urplus earnings
estimated at $1,500,000. These figures
aggregate $9,246,000. Deducting from
this $8,250,000 leaves a Shrinkage of
his values of $996,000.
Bethlehem is rated to-day as worth
$10, 000, 000, with accumulated profits
of $4,000,000. To-day Schwab's hold
ings may be set down at $8,250,000,
or $11,750,000 less than the Sheldon-
Pam-Schwab plan contemplated.

SAN DOMINGO, Wednesday, Feb. 3.
âThe funeral of J. C. Johnston, the
engineer of the Yankee launch, who
was deliberately killed by the ipsur
gents on Monday, took place this morn
ing. The body was escorted to its
grave, in the Santa Barbara Cemetery,
by a detachment of marines, blue
jackets and officers from the Yankee,
headed by the ship's band. There were,
in all, 100 men from the cruiser in ths
cortege. Minister Powell, the Ameri
can Consul and Vice-Consul, 'and
nearly all the diplomatic and consular
representatives here went to the
funeral. The provisional Government
sent a detachment of troops to act as
an escort. The flag3 over the Govern
ment buildings and the various consu
lates were at half-mast. The coffin was
covered with wreaths of flowers, ope
of which had been sent by the German
Consulate, on behalf of Emperor Will
iam, while others were from the Ameri
can legation, the American Consulate,
etc. The streets of the city were
thronged with people as the funeral
procession passed, and there were
many expressions of sorrow at John
ston's death.
Great surprise is expressed by the
foreigners here, especially by the
Americans, that the commander of the
Yankee has not yet demanded satis
faction for .this Inexcusable act and
for the firing upon the American flag
by the insurgents.
There was heavy firing all day all
around the city. A German steamship
from Europe was obliged to leave the
port with her cargo on board because
the crews of the lighters refused tt>
work, on account of being exposed to
the insurgents firing from across the
river.
All the houses outside the city walla
have been pillaged. The insurgents are
desperate and are destroying foreign
property wherever they find it. Powell
has received urgent appeals to protect
foreign property against this pillaging,
and the Columbia will land marines to
do so.

a resolution strongly indorsing Presi

A resolution offered oy Thomas P.

President Roosevelt attended the aft

I need hardly to say how Klad I am to wel
come you here to Washington, and I am sure
al*o that it is almost unnecessary fortnÂ« to

you as my fellow Republicans I wish you to
know how every man here in Washington who
is Ft riving to do what in him lies to serve his
party or make that party yerve the country
realizes the dependence upon you and these

purpose effective. It is upon your interpreta

pend for having these acts received at their
proper worth b> tl;e people as a whole. I feel
vÂ«ry strongly that what we need is simply to
have the exact truth\told, to have what we
have dene set forth as it has been done and
to have our purposes interpreted In the light
not merely of our words, but cf our deeds:
and you know that that is all we need and to

WHITE PACERS
TO BE HUNTED
Kaiiriimcn of Southern Utah
"Will Make Concerted Attempt
to Capture Famed Horses
Special Dispatch to The Call
SALT LAKE, Feb. 7.â Strangest of
all equine bands, the "white pacers"
of the southern range, are doomed to
captivity or extermination. The ranch
men of Southern Utah, Western NeÂ»
vada and a small strip of Arizona' hav*
passed sentence on this remarkable
aggregation of wild horses that for
seven years excited the'greates*t*ihter
est, but which has so far: mocked . ev
ery effort at capture.
A few weeks ago the stockman* of
the border country engaged in a wild
horse huntâ a raid of extermination on
the wild mustangs that have become a
pest of the range. Many ofthe animals
were killed, but the "white pacers"
escaped the general slaughter for two
very good reasons â the hunters did not
come across this particular band, and,
even if the opportunity had presented
itself, no attempt to kill them would
have been made. The ranchmen have
for years cherished the hope of some
day capturing some of the beautiful
animals, and for this reason none have
ever been shot. Individual attempts to
take them, however, have always sig
nally failed, and now an organized and
determined effort Is to be made. Plans
have been carefully made with a full
knowledge of the habits of the quarry
and the nature of the country, and it
is hoped that a dozen or more of the
coveted eo^uincs will be taken. If it is
necessary a number of the horses will
be killed in order to make the work
of capturing the others easier. The
decision of the ranVhmen is to capture
or exterminate the entire band.
Unlike the ordinary "scrub" mus
tang of the ranges, whose presence is
an abomination to the ranchers, the
milch-desired white beauties are of
magnificent build and swift as the
famed, steeds of the Arabian desert.
They are all of the same hue â white â
ar.d have long manes and tails of the
same color. In speed they easily out
strip the ranch horses. A strange fea
ture is that they are all pacers. Very
seldom have they been known to break
into a run, and then only for a short
distance, soon relapsing into the long,
swift stride that appears to be their
natural gait. The ranchmen believe
that some of these animals . can be
trained to become great racehorses.
There are supposed to be about 100 in
this band. - , â 
A great stallion, of magnificent pro
portions. i3 the leader, of this equine
familyâ for family it certainly Isâ
and he is described as an animal of
remarkable beauty, j At the head of
the band this stallion has led his fol
lowers' in , wild dashes over the hills
when pursued by the ranchers, and the
pace was so rapid that the hunters
were soon compelled to desist. Just
now these horses are reported to be
ranging along the Colorado River. In
the summer they come up into Utah.
It is now planned to effect their cap
ture, or at least the capture of some
of the band, by having a number) of
parties act in concert and drive the
horses into a trapâ probably into some
box canyon.
Immortelles for Wreaths.
The manufacture of Immortelle
wreaths in Paris occupies at least fif
teen hundred persons. The immortelles
are gathered about the beginning of
October and come chiefly from the arid
hills in thÂ« middle and south of France.
They are brought to the markets In
their natural condition and the yellow
blossoms are dyed green, red and white
and woven /into wreaths by special
workmen in readiness for AH Saints'
and AH Souls' days, when all good
Parisians visit their relatives' graves.
On these "fetes .des morts" the gatea
of the cemeteries are bese*t with crowds
of dealers in immortelle wreaths, wire
crosses and bead crowns. At Pere la
Chaise alone more than two hundred
thousand persons are calculated to visit
the/emetery. and the sale of immortelle
wreaths varies from 20,000 to 25,000.â

Weather conditions unfavorably affect trade
and transportation throughout most of the

situation of these staples a matter of concern.

REAL WOLVES LOOSE
IN STREETS OF CHICAGO
Captured in Wisconsin and Made Es
cape From Cage In 'Warehouse.
Efforts of voters at recent munici
pal elections to rid the town of "gray
wolves" have been in vain. The gray
wolf is loose in Englewood, three of
him, and barred doors and deserted
streets were the signs last night that
the animals were feared. Four
prairie v wolves escaped from a cage in
"the rear room of the commission
house of WilsÂ«n Harris, 756 West
Sixty-third street, at noon. They had
been captured in Northern Wisconsin
and were consigned to R. G. Mason of
Kirkville, Mo., a dealer in wild ani
mals. Gnawing through the wire net
ting of the big box in which they were
confined, the â¢, beasts sped through a
door into the alley. Just drawing up
to the building was W. W r . Wilson, a
partner in the business, with a load
of produce. The horse tried to climb
the side of a barn and then tore down
the alley.
Three of the wolves ran east iri
Englewood avenue, while the fourth
crawled under a pile of railroad ties.
This one was captured later by driv
ing out and into a box with boiling
water. A gang of railroad laborers
saw the 1 three beasts approaching and
fied, one man shinning up a telephone
pole. A short distance away H. J.
Smalley and C. W T ood, 756 Englewood
avenue, were walking. : With them
was a coach dog. The dog showed
friendship, and the ne,xt instant a
wolf was trying to eat him up. Mr.
Smalley clubbed the wolf over the
head, and it ceased its attack and ran
into an alley.
Late in the day the police were
notified that two wolves had been
seen at' Eighty-seventh street and
Western avenue, and that a hunting
party had been organized. â Chicago

Carious Case In French Court.
In a recent novel Georges Ohnet
called one of the products which his
principal character placed on the mar
ket "a brictonine." He was not aware
at the time that a liquor of that name
actually existed, but its manufacturer
promptly brought an action for dam
ages. The CiviJ Tribunal of the Seine
gave its decision against the novelist.
While It exonerated M. Ohnet from ma
licious intent, it held that ignorance
was no excuse, and that it was the
duty of writers to satisfy themselves
that products to which they Intended
to refer did not exist. In this case,
added the court, M. Ohnet could easily
have consulted the register of trade
marks. . Consequently the court ordered
the passages objected to to be erased
from the book under a penalty of 10
francs a copy- while the plaintiff was
awarded 500 francs damages, and the
right to have the Judgment inserted In
two newspapers. â New York Tribune.

MORE CHEERFUL
Attending 1 ' Physicians Announce
Him to Be Suffering From
, -Attack of Irregular Typhoid
CASE IS^ ONE OF GRAVITY
Medical Men Acknowledge It
Is ; Yet Too Early to Forecast
the Result of . the Sickness
WASHINGTON, Feb. 5.â Senator
Hanrials -illness is officially announced
by^hlsT;. 'physicians -to be /irregular
typhoidâ that -is, typhoid fever, with
the fever symptoms less -regular and
marked than in the pronounced types
of the disease. It is stated that there
are no organic complications to add
to the seriousness of the case; but the
Senator at the time of the attack was
in a literally worn-out condition, so
that his extreme physical ' weakness
and nervous depression; coupled with
his age, .66 years,;- and frequent recent
rheumatic attacks, makes the case one
of much more gravity than an ordinary
attack of typhoid fever of a compara
tively^ mild character. ...... ..... ' ; -â 
The. crisis of the fever is not ex
pected before the middle of next week.
The Senator is conscious and to-day
insisted,, on some papers being brought
to him -for his signature, but was so
weak that when he was put off two or
three times he dropped off into slum
ber from exhaustion. He gained con
siderable Vest during the day, but to
an extent his sleep was the result of
his weakness. His physicians to-night
expressed confidence in the Senator's
recovery, but admitted that even if no
complications or unforeseen""develop
ments of any kind occurred recovery
would be .a matter of weeks and will
require meanwhile the most careful
and painstaking nursing. No one save
Mrs. Hanna, Miss Phelps, the Senator's
niece, and Elmer Dover, his secretary,
are permitted to see him, aside \ from,
the physicians and two trained nurses,
of whom one is a typhoid fever expert
from Philadelphia,
CONDITION NOT ALARMING.
President Roosevelt called atjthe Ar
lington Hotel during the day uTinquire
about Senator Hanna's condition.- He
saw Secretary Dover, with whom he
conversed for' ten minutes about the
sick man. The physicians gave. some
consideration to the fact that most of
the Senator's immediate kin are out of
th^city and that several of them are
as far away as Thomasville,' Ga., but
decided for the present at least there
was no occasion to send for them. It
is hoped to bring about a sufficient im
provement in Hanna's condition to per
mit his removal to Thomasville.
Five physicians were in attendance
to-day: Dr. Rixey, the regular phy
sician; Dr. Magruder; Dr. Brewer, from
New York; Df. Behronden,. an expert
who examined the Senator's blood for
typhoid" indications, anfl Dr. Oster, the
expert diagnostician, from Baltimore,
who will continue in consultation with
the other physicians during the Sena
tor's illness.
/The physicians are unable to say
where the Senator caught the typhoid
fever. There is a typhoid fever epi
demic at Columbus, Ohio, where the
Senator visited last month. He left
there about the 13th ultimo and .be
came ill nine days after that time, the
length of time that medical authorities
give for the breaking out of the fever
infection. A great number of inquiries,
telegraphic, mail and personal, are
reaching here about Senator Hanna's
condition.
Governor Herrick called on the long
distance telephone from Columbus.
Ohio, to-night to Inquire after the Sen
ator and asked to be kept informed of
the progress of the case. . Secretary
Dover, told him he believed the situa
tion thus far is not alarming.
TEJIPERATURE IS HIGHER.
Dr. Rixey called to see the Senator
shortly after 8 o'clock. His object
was simply to take Hanna's temper
ature, which he found at that time to
be 102 2-5, higher, he remarked later,
than it had been at any time since he
has been attending the Senator. This,
however, the doctor did not consider
alarming, as it might be due to cer
tain local causes not, directly the re
sult of fever. The 8 o'clock :call was
the last Dr. Rixey intended to, make
for the night unless something unex
pected should occur. â â 
The most satisfactory aspect of the
case j to-day" apparently lo the Sena
tor's family and friends was the
cheerful and bright 1 ' manner of the
Senator, despite his almost utter pros
tration. This they attribute in part
to the slightest kind- of an improve
ment In his general condition and to
his relief at the announcement of tho
exact character of the disease, which
thus removes his own and his fam
ily's uncertainty in the matter. The
Senator % t6ok milk nourishment sev
eral times to-day, retaining it on his
stomach without apparent discomfort
Certain pains which he "has experi
enced in the stomach, were relieved
by the administration of a sedative.
Late to-night the physicians declared
there is nothing. immediately alarming
in Senator Hanna's condition provid
ed unexpected complications do not
manifest themselves,' but they ac
knowledge it is yet too early to fore
cast the result of the Senator's sick
ness.

WASHINGTON, Feb. 5.â In the pos
tal trial to-day Mrs. Martha J. Lorenz
of Toledo, Ohio, denied all knowledge
of any transaction in connection with
the sale of Groff letter box fasteners.
The four checks which she at different
times gave her husband, who indorsed
them over to Machen, â¢ she said, she
signed solely because her husband re
quested her to do so^and without in
quiring into their purpose. She had ab-.
solute faith in him, she said. Mrs. Lo
renz was perfectly cool on the -stand
and promptly answered the questions
put to her by her counsel.
During almost the entire day George
E, .... Lorenz was under, cross-examina
tion. He denied that he ever sought
Machen's . influence to further the : in
troduction: of the Groff fasteners to the
postal service.
. Jus^ before < the afternoon session
Justice Pritchard summoned into his
private, room the jury and counsel on
both sides. He announced to them that
two jurors had informed him of the
recejpt of several letters J bearing on
the 'case, which represented that they
ought to stand by the Government. It
is understood that the Government
counsel disavowed any responsibility
for the communications, while counsel
for the defense availed themselves of
the opportunity to say that neither by
word nor act had any attempt been
made by them or their clients to influ

How Spencer Learned Things.
Herbert Spencer and a friend were
once walking toward an asylum they
proposed to visit. Their way led them
across a railroad, and seated near the
track they saw a young man reading.
This iyoung man was an inmate of the
institution, but they did not know it at
the time.
"My friend," said Mr. Spencer, paus
ing, "where does this railroad go to?"
The lunatic looked up from his book
and gave his Interrogator a long stare
of scorn. Then he replied:
"It 'doesn't go anywhere. We keep It
here to run trains on."

Democrat, of Texas, one of the young

to bring about a reform in the matter
of distribution of seeds by the Govern

brought it in so far as seeds for free
distribution were concerned. This was
the only item in the agricultural ap
propriation bill that aroused serious
discussion and with a few minor
amendments the bill was passed by the
House without division.

glee of the way he achieved a reputa

took a walk with Professor Newton,
who lived in the world of mathematics,
and started off at once to discuss' an
abstruse problem. Mr. Phelps' mind
could not follow and wandered to other
things. At last he was called back
when the professor wound up with
"which you see gives us X." "Does it?"
asked Mr. Phelps politely. "Why,
doesn't It?" exclaimed the professor,
excitedly, alarmed at the possibility of
a flaw in his calculations. Quickly his
mind ran back and detected a mistake.
"You are right, Mr. Phelps. You are
right!" shoute4 the professor. "It
doesn't give us X; It gives us Y." And
from that time Professor Phelps was

PANIC STRIKES
COTTON MARKET
Wildest Scenes of Week Are
Witnessed at the Opening of
the New Orleans Exchange
TRADERS BECOJIE CRAZED
Prices Are Forced Down Ten
and Twenty Points at a Time
Owing to Numerous Offerings
NEW ORLEANS. Feb. 5.â To-day
saw the wildest scenes of this week in
the cotton market. At the lowest levels
of the day prices were from 132 to ISO
points lower than what cotton was
selling for at the first of the week. The
market was thrown into a panic soon
after the opening by the immense
amount of cotton that was offered for
sale. Where the offerings came from
was a mystery, but thousands of bales
were thrown upon the market, forcing
prices down 10 and 20 points at a time.
Such wild scenes were never before
witnessed. Thousands of people lined
Gravier street watching the traders
scrambling in their eagerness to get
near the center of the ring and offer
their cotton. There appeared to be ten
sellers to one buyer.
At the height of the turmoil, when
it looked as if the market must go to
pieces, the bull leader, W. P. Brown,
pleaded with the brokers to stop of
fering their cotton 15 and 20 points un
der the market.
"You will break the market and your
selves if you cont^iue," he said. "Taks
the cotton yourselves and make a
profit on It."
Brown's stand against the selling Im
mediately had its effect and it was
clearly evident to every one that the
rules of the exchange were being
broken by the way many brokers were
offering cotton. The bull leader followed
his speech by heavy bidding and buy
ing and in a few minutes other longs
followed his lead and in a short time.
In place of the panic, quiet reigned and
prices showed a material recovery, al
though the market had a weak- tone
â¢up to the close.

TREATY PROPOSED BY JAPAN.
The statement is published here

Japan originally submitted to Russia
â -ir.cd seven artjcles, the first of
which provided for the mutual recog

Korea on finances and general admin

Ku i; ja should not hinder the develop

Japan was entitled to send troops to
Korea in the event of disturbances,
such troop* to be withdrawn when

A i*plomat in close touch with the
Russian side of the negotiations said
that Korea had again become the most
difncult matter for adjustment. Rus
sia, he siiid, could not agree to Jap
anese fortifications in Southern Korea.
"If the Japanese Government is sin
cerely desirous of avoiding v/ar," he
added, "it will find in the reply when it
arrives a basis for an agreement; but
if the authorities have made up their
minds to remain unyielding, the ne
gotiations must end in conflict. In any
event, I do not see how Japan can
break off the negotiations without re
plying to the Russian note and setting
forth her minimum demands."
Advices from Vladivostok say that
more than a thousand Japanese girls
embarked there for Japan yesterday
ard that three other steamers are on
the point of sailing for Japan with
Japanese families, including many who
left the Nikolskoye and Ushuri regions
on Wednesday last.

the Russian Pacific squadron which
have been held in reserve are now in

East Siberian Rifle Brigade, which re

the high officials remained calm, in
sisting that a peaceful settlement was
still possible. They said the military

hurried demonstrations by Japan, and
added that misinterpretations were be

Near the Scene of Strife.
WASHINGTON, Feb. 5.â The state
ment was reiterated at the Navy De
partment to-day that in case of a Jap
anese-Russian war the fighting ships
of the Asiatic fleet would be kept away
from the scene of hostilities and every

ners." That the American navy, how
ever, may not be without observers of
what will be the greatest naval strug
gle of modern times, several of the
smaller shirs of the fleet will be de
tailed to go northward with competent
officers, who will act as official observ
ers. No orders to this effect have yet
been issued.

XEW BRITAIN. Feb. 5. â An autop

Of the eight shots fired inter Seli

paralysis of the body to such an ex

Remarkable Assertions Made by the
Mikado's London Representa
tive in an Interview.
War Will Be Declared Should the
Russian Reply Prove to Be
Unsatisfactory.
PARIS, Feb. 5.â Foreign Minister Del
casse presented a review of the Far
Eastern situation at a meeting of the
Cabinet to-day, but he was unable to
acquaint the Ministers with the full
contents of the Russian reply, because
It had not been received here. Until
war actually begins, the French au
thorities say, they will take the view
that a peaceful settlement is possible.
They admit, however, that the chance
is slim despite the concessions which
Russia is believed to have made.
At the Russian Embassy it was said
that on Sunday or later there would be
news, but that there was nothing to
Justify the pessimistic reports which
had been current for the last few days.
An interview published here with
Baron Hayashi, the Japanese Minister
to Great Britain, has attracted marked
attention in higher government quar
ters, particularly his declarations that
unless Russia signed a treaty carrying
out Japan's demands war would result,
and his statement that Japan desired
to be let alone and would object to any
intervention by Great Britain tending
toward inducing the acceptance of Rus
sia's reply. One of the officials In touch
with Foreign Minister Delcasse said
that If this interview was genuine, as
it seemed to be, it was of the highest
moment.
Baron Hayashi reiterated his pub
lished statements that Japan would in
sist on a signed treaty recognizing Chi
na's rights in Manchuria, and is quoted
as having said:
jj "If Russia refuses this treaty we will
fight."
. "Is your Government unalterably de
termined on this course?" the Minister
was asked.
"Absolutely," he Is said to have re
plied. "We will not take promises. Too
many promises have been broken*, and
now we insist upon a signed treaty.** .
The interviewer then asked: "Sup
pose Russia's answer is conciliatory
and, reasonable, but refuses to go to
the extent of signing the treaty you
desire, will your Government have re
course to arms?"
/That is precisely what I mean,"
replied the Minister.
"If the Government of his Majesty
King Edward VII asks Japan not to
make war," continued the Interviewer,
"and requests her to accept Russia's
reply, what will Japan do?"
"We shall greatly object to such
intervention, even coming from the
King. We desire to be let alone in our
duel with Russia. â¢ We do not want
support or assistance. We desire to
settle our own account with Russia."
'. In : terminating -the interview Baron
Hayashi was asked:
"Then you say that if Russia re-
fuses to sign a treaty recognizlns
China's rights In Manchuria that
means war?"
"That will be war," replied the Min
ister. â ; .".W.-*
The Baron added to the foregoing
that he believed thl3 to be the view
of his Government, and that authority
had been given him to announce it.
The French officials expressed great
surprise at his unqualified statements
concerning war and of Japan's inten
tion r.ot to accede to a British request
against war.
The London correspondent of ths
Matin said In a dispatch to-night that
he had submitted to Baron Hayashi a
translation published in a London
evening newspaper of the interview
with the Minister printed here In th*>
Matin. Baron Hayashi declared the
Matin correspondent had faithfully
reproduced his utterances and that ha
was ready to repeat them.

SAL1XAS. Feb. 5.â The finding of
three steamer life rafts in Monterey
Bay during the last two days has oc
casioned much' speculation regarding
jirobable wrecks.
On Wednesday evening", while the
fishing launch Kid of Santa Cruz was
returning from a fishing trip to Point
Cypress, below Pacific Grove, her crew
sighted two rafts about a mile- apart
and firur miles south of . Point Pino*
lighthouse. Thinking that there might
be persons aboard, the skipper of the
l\:g headed for the derelicts and they
were picked up. Although no one was
on eiiiier. the rafts were brought to
Monterey, where upon inspection
were discovered to be from different
vessels. One is a tule raft painted lead
color and the crther is of cork of a terra
cotta hue. : -1*
Yesterday' morning the third raft',
similar to the other tule one, 'drifted
fshore near Chinatown below Monte
rey. None of the rafts bore any marks
or names, to designate the vessels to
which they belonged, ner was any
wreckage seen. There have been no
storms hore previous to th*Â» present one.
no vessels have been lost within sev
eral hundred miles from* Monterey and
the only conclusion is that the rafts
probably belong to some vessels wreck
ed o-ff the north?â¢ coast recently and
â were driven south by heavy wind and
tide.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY, FEBRUARY G, 190i.
STATE MAKES SPLENDID
SHOWING IN OIL FIELDS
Returns From South Prove That California, Under
Poor Conditions, Holds Its Own in Comparison
With Gushing Wells of Texas and Louisiana
Figures relating to the shipments of
oil from the Texas and Louisiana oil
fields for the year 1903 have just been
made public. Compared with the re
turns for California during the same
twelve months, and bearing in mind
local conditions, the situation is . ex
tremely favorable to the oil industry in
this State. The total shipments from
the oil fields of the Southern States in
1903, including Beaumont and Sour
Lake, amounted to but 15,000,000 bar
rels.
The output of California last year,
according to the estimates supplied by
Secretary Dean of the California Pe
troleum Miners' Association, amounted
to 20,000,000 barrels. It is a matter of
common knowledge that California can
easily produce twice that amount when
the fields are developed sufficiently.
The oil sands are rich and seemingly
inexhaustible for many years. The price
for fuel oil is still the deterring cause
that retards development. There is no
scarcity of oil in any field, but not <5ne
fuel oil section is producing anything
like DO per cent of its present ascer
tained capacity.
In a sense the same conditions obtain
that earlier were marked features in
California. There are a few rich com
panies that^have large plants and large
outputs and profitable contracts for
supplies. On the other hand, there are
companies that still are suffering for
lack of coin; that own* their properties,
with no debt and no cloud on' the title
to the iand; that". are' equipped with
plants that are not used because they
are limited and are not able to produce
to make a profit at ruling prices on the
basis of a small output.
One conspicuous example of this sort
of financial tie-up is a company In
which certain leading politicians and
lawyers of this city are concerned. The
company has two wells that have oil in
them, a quarter-section of land situ
ated in proved territory, and adjoining
land in which oil has been profitably
and largely produced with large plants,
yet the smaller company is tied up and
is not turning a wheel. Undoubtedly
there are other companies in the same
fix. To operate the works of the com
pany in question it would be necessary
to expend $75,000 in sinking a number of
additional wells and in providing large
pumping plants, jacks, etc.
Another drawback to the prosecution
of private development work on the
scale possible has been the entrance
into the field of both the Santa Fe and
Southern Pacific companies as pro
ducers of fuel for their own locomo
tives. This has removed a demand for
oil from the ooen market, for the
transportation lines are able to produce
their own fuel.
The Southern Pacific Company has
bought, out the several large compa
nies that form a constituent part of the
Associated Oil Company, the largest oil
concern in the Kern County fields and
the largest oil company in the State
with; the exception of the Standard Oil.
By the purchase of the stocks of the
companies that were merged in the As
sociated Oil Company the Southern Pa
cific Company has 1 made an advance
toward controlling the Associated Oil.
As the Southern Pacific Company is
not likely to' be contented to have only
a minority Interest in any enterprise In
which it is concerned, it is probably
safe to assume that the great railway
corporation will always get all the oil
it needs for its own consumption at
\ practically its own price. It will be
I cheaper for the railway company to
pump oil than to mine for coal.
Bearing these and allied facts In
mind and assuming that Dr. Deane's
figures relative to the production of
mineral oil in California in 1903 are cor
rect and that California produced 20,
000,000 barrels under temporarily, de
pressing conditions for the smaller
companies, it is evident that Texas
| cannot hope to permanently compete
I with the California fields, in which Is
| stored enough cheap fuel to last as a
' basis of profitable manufacturing for at
least a century.
There was a wide market for the
Texas oil last year. The greatest
,amount shipped naturally went by,
steamship and barges to New Orleans,
to Atlantic points, Cuba, England and
Egypt. By way of Sablne Pass 1,146,173
! barrels went to domestic ports and for
eign countries, and 5.711.615 barrels were
shipped in tank cars to points in Texas
and Louisiana. Only a small percent
j age of the rail shipments went outside
! of Texas and Louisiana.

shipments thÂ» total from Texas and Louisiana
fields amounted to 14.099,442 barrels. The rec
ord shipments by the Kansas City Southern
Railroad for the year was not obtainable, nor
a complete record of barge shipments from tho
Jennlnsa field. Of the rail shipments the
Southern Pacific handled from Gladys (Spindle
Top) 10 6C7 cars; from Beaumont. 1663 cars;
fr<m" Sour Lake 11.309 car*; from Jennings,
lUl'b cars. Shlpmznts from Sour Lake were
rot started until July, 1903. The Santa IÂ«>
moved 3S33 cars from Beaumont. In cotn
putins the Southern Pacific shipments from
Gladys and Beaumont an average car capacity
of 200 barrels is used. Most of the system
cam shiprvd from Gladys and Beaumont are
of 300 barrels capacity, while the private line
carR vary from 1C0 to 200 barrels. At Sour
LakÂ« the 3CO-barrel system cars predominate.
The same applies to Jennings. The Santa Fa
cistern cars are of 225 barrels capacity. It is
difficult.. to fl>ure the complete production of
the various Texas fields for the year 1003 owing
to the great number of operators and diversity
of interests, but estimates are stated as fol
lows: Spindle Top, 8.500.000 barrels: Sour
Lake, 7.000,000 barrels; Jennings, 500.000 bar
rels; Saratoga. 100,000 barrels; total estimated
production 14.100.000 barrels. Estimates of
oil in sto'rage range between 7,000,000 and
H 000 000 barrels, not including: the 1.A00.0UO
barrels In Southern Pacific tanks or Texas oil
in storage at Eastern stations.
The Mountain Copper Company in
Shasta County figures high up in a list
of the producers of refined copper in the
United" States during 1903. The Moun
tain Copper production was, as esti
mated. 25,000,000 pounds. This was a
falling off from 1901, by reason of labor
troubles, of 4,000,000 pounds. The great
producers of copper in the

WORKING THE MIXES.
In addition to twenty-four dredgers
in operation* about Oroville, six new
machines are building for work in that
spction. The present array of dredgers
is kept at* work steadily. Drilling out
fits are prospecting new ground day
ahd night. ; * : â 'â 'â .
The Independence gravel mine near-
Angels, Calaveras , County, arid* the
Jones mine near Angels .. are about to
resume. - >
The Pine mine'on Mokelumne River
has been bought by Newman and oth
ers. The property will be opened up
by tunnel, to strike the' ledge 100 feet
below the old workings. â â ,-*.;
The Mining and Scientific Press, re
ports that -the tailings and sulphurets :
from the Rattlesnake mine, near Gar
den Valley, El Dorado County, as treat
ed by the cyanide process, have yielded
as high as $20 a ton in gold. The'ore
when run through the mill did not pay
enough to make a-profit." â¢â¢. ;
The Cataract mine In Plumas County,
near Quincy, has been sold to W. Whit
aker and others. The : Peter quartz
mine at Indian Valley, near Genessee,
will be opened up by a' Minneapolis
company. " .
. A new dredger to work near Folsom
will be operated by the Folsom De
velopment â  Company. It will work to
the depth of forty feet below the water
level.
The dredger of the California and De
troit Dredging Company has begun to
operate near Horsetown, Shasta Coun
ty. The company reports that other
dredgers will be built for Its use.
The Mountaineer mine near Nevada
City has bÂ»en unwatered and work on
the 400 and 700 levels is proceeding.
The . Fernandez hydraulic mine near
Yreka. Siskiyou County, is again
operating.
A 1 30-ton smelter will be built for the
Rio Vista gold and copper mine near
Nashville, ,E1 Dorado County.
The Bully Hill smelter will substi
tute oil fuel for wood. An Oroville
dredging company has bonded eighty
five acres of the river bar just east of
Red Bluff. The land will be prospected
with the drill.
Probably the busiest mine in the
world is the Treadwell, in Alaska,
which is In operation twenty-four hours
In the day every day in the year with
the exception of the Fourth of July and
Christmas. I There are 880 stamps, each
consisting of five heavy, upright bars
of steel that fall with crushing force
on flat plates. The mill crushes 4500
tons of rock daily.
SOME RAILROAD CliAIMS.
There is some food for thought in
the statement of the controversy that
has arisen in Southern Wyoming be
tween the Union Pacific Railway and
the miners, as It is condensed by the
Mining and Scientific Press. The sub
stance of the matter is as follows:
Prospectors have been searching on the odd
numbered sections claimed by the railroad
company under the grant from the Government.
The grant in question excepta mineral lands,
but docs not Include those containing â  coal or
iron. Hut when land is referred to as
"mineral" It must have been known as mineral
prior to the time when the grant attached, and
the discovery of a gold, copper or other metal
mine after the title has passed to the railroad
Is not Included In the land excepted from thu
grant. The Wyoming prospectors are searching
for both coal and petroleum, but as coal lands
are distinctly excepted from the operation of
the statute which reserves the mineral land*.
the prospectors have little to hope for In that
direction: â  ' Petroleum lands, however, are
recognized as mineral and are subject to loca
tion on the public domain and lands within
the rai.road grants whigh are discovered to be
oil bearing before the railroad company has
acquired title to them are subject to location
as mineral lands. It la reported that the Union
Pacific Company has posted notices warning
prospectors that they must confine their ex
plorations to the lands of the public domain.
Prospectors, before searching for mineral on
these land*, would do well to ascertain the
state of the title to any particular section of
land, for where the railroad company hats per
fected Us title, the case of the prospector Is
hopeless. ... .
Stockholders Sue Directors.
Two suits to determine stockhold
ers' liabilities were filed yesterday by
the stockholders of the Hana Planta
tion Company against M. S. Grln
baum, E. J. Benjamin, D. C. Bates.
Thomas Jennings and Arthur Jen
nings, directors of the corporation.
The plaintiffs allege that the directors
made a fictitious increase of stock on
two different occasions since 1888 and
indebted the concern in the sum of
$500,000. They ask the court to de
termine to what extent. the stockhold
ers shall be held liable.

New Institution for the Care
of the Veterans at Yountville
Home Is Ou>w Completed
QUARTERS FOR THE SICK
Building Is 3Iodern and Pic
turesque in Style With Ac
commodations in Abundance
Special Dispatch to The Call.
YOUNTVILLE, Feb. ' 5.â At the
Veterans' Home here an up-to-date
hospital' -has Just been completed.
The Legislature at itssession of 1901
appropriated for the erection of this
building $25,000. In 1903 it made a
similar appropriation,, only $15,000 of
which has been used,, leaving a bal
ance of $10,000 still available for the
construction of a phthisical ward.;
This new institution for the sick has
been *n : course of construction .for
some months and is in every way an
ideal' abode for the invalids at the
home. , The hospital is of modern
workmanship ' and is based upon ; the
pavilion type. . The . exterior of the
building is finished in cement concrete,
upon metal lath, and is ' topped off
above . the main cornice with " Spanish
terra cotta tile.' The character of the
material employed insures a uniform
temperature throughout the building.
An ample amount of light and un
obstructed circulation of air are pos
sible throughout the building, as it is
a group of semi-detached building3
or wings. - The east and west wings
are ward "pavilions and accommodate
on the main floor thirty-flve beds and
on the basement floor thirty beds each.
In these wards on the basement floor
will be placed' convalescents and men
too old and feeble to be in the quar
ters but able to go up and down stair3
to meals and walk independently
around the grounds. On this floor
there is also a ward for men confined
entirely! to their wheel chairs.
Throughout the basement floor all in
clines are graduated. Thus the in
valids in the chairs will' be at liberty
to wheel 'themselves around as they
please. '^ There are long arcades in
front of the basement sfory, where
these , sufferers will be able to push
their chairs in and- out when the
weather is fine and look on the beauti
ful surrounding scenery. This lower
floor also affords a bright, cozy din
ing-room for these helpless invalids
and is connected by a food elevator
with the kitchen above. Besides the
wards the basement story contains the
steward's office, male employes* quar
ters and a splendid reading and smok
ing room.
At right'angles to the ward pavilions
and separating them is the administra
tion pavilion, the- main floor consist
ing of the medical director's and as
sistant's office, operating, sterilizing,
dressing, waiting and oculist's rooms.
Directly across the hall 'from;' the ope
rating room is the surgical ward,
where there Is every facility for taking
the best care of the patients. The
basement and the main floors each
have two octagonal solariums, con
necting the wards with the administra
tion pavilion. The second or top floor
is well finished and will be used as
quarters for the medical staff.
Supreme Court Ends Dispute.
The Supreme Court yesterday decid
ed that Elisha F. Gordan was entitled
to administer the estate of Eliza E.
Gordan, who died in San Francisco
October 25, 1900. Ex-Public Admin
istrator Farnham maintained that
Gordan was not a resident of Califor
nia and that he was incompetent. The
court has also decided that the firm
of Hale Bros, may collect $12,000
damages from Milliken,Bros. of New
York because tfie latter concern failed
to comply with the terms of a con
tract in which It agreed to furnish a
supply of sructural steel on a speci
fied date.
Corpse Found In the Bay.
The partly decomposed body of a
drowned man was found floating in
the bay yesterday by Harry Jacobs.
Nothing was found in the pockets by
which the body might be identified.
The trousers were of dark gray ma
terial and the : coat was dark. The
vest was missing. The underwear
was of White cotton: there were- a
negligee overshirt with black and
white stripes, black lace shoes and
black sock/ 1 . The clothing was of
cheap material and well worn.

TO INSTALL SYSTEM FOR
TRACING FREIGHT CARS
Superintendent of Santa Fe Road
Here to Effect Arrangements for
Movement of Trains.
C. W. Kouns, superintendent of
transportation of the Santa Fe Rail
road, arrived here last evening. He
has come West for the purpose of in
stalling between this city and Los An
geles a new system for recording the
movement of freight over the Western
lines of the company. It is a system
whereby cars may be constantly
traced on their way to their destina
tion and is of special value to the
shippers of green fruit and other per
ishable products who are eager to
learn when their shipments arrive at
the points to which they are con
signed. The headquarters of the sys
tem will be In Los Angeles and will be
in charge of Â«. man who will not only
keep in touch with the moving freight
trains, but with the consignees, and
will furnish commercial agents of the
company along the line with informa
tion as to the daily movements of the
cars in which they are- Interested. It
has been in operation on the Gulf.
Colorado and Santa Fe line for some
time and has proved a great success.

SA^f DIEGO. Feb. 5.â The -entire
co'onty Treat cf the cjountaisa was vis
ited this zzcTzlzg and to-night by the
test rain that has ever come to this
section. H gsod In itself, and It
trma good because it was never more
needed thai at present.
The raia this zaornlss lasted four
hours, and at 5:55 o'clock this evening
~jin started again. It continued gen
ercusly for hours and it Is still raining.
The nioming rain brought .38 of an
inch, and the tiight rain brought .57 of
&n inch up to 8 o'clock. There' is every
Indication that the fall will continue
until nicming.
In tiie back country there was a
-htaÂ»ier fail. The morning rain began
Â« ax Her and stayed later. The Escon
dido Valley had nearly two inches of
rain up to 9 o'clock, and rain is still
failing to-night. Oceanside has report
â¢"'1 two-thirds of an inch for the morn
ing and a half-inch for the evening
rdCl up to 8 o'clock.
It is raining at Valley Center, Teme
cula and Murieta in the northern por-
of the county, and at every place
that can be reached by telephone in the
southern sec; '.on. There were good
rains along the line of the Southern
California Mountain Water Company's
system. At the lower Otay dam there
tray a fall of .50 of an inch, at upper
otay .S6 of an inch and at Jamul 1.03
inches up to dark, and rain was still
falling. People are more than pleased
after their long wait for rain, and are
wondering if the history of 1SS7 is to be
repeated, when nine inches of rain fell
In the month of February.
LOS ANGELES, Feb. Z.â Not since j
last winter has Southern California re- (
celved such a drenching as that which
resulted from the present storm. It was
the first real rain of the season and. !
although only 1.13 inches fell in this ,
city, the country districts report a j
much heavier rainfall, especially in the
artesian belt, upon which the great |
valley south of the Tehachapi must de
pend Cor its irrigation supply.
.During ordinary seasons such an ;
arrcunt of rainfall weald be consid- j
er^i simply an incident, but this year, !
wntn only .T>~ of an inch had fallen \
tince May. it was an event. The cash ;
value of this rain to the ranchers and I
cattle owners throughout this section!
cannot be ct-rr.puted. It doe? net mean
that good crops of^very kind are as- â 
Fured; it does not mean that the full
effect! of the long draught have been |
effaced, but it means grass for the cat- t
tie and water for the growing crops !
at a time when without it both cattle
and crops would have been a total lo-ss, ;
cr practically so.
â¢me was when a season like the â¢
rrtser.t one has been would mean ruin â¢
for Southern California, but tffat was .
dnrlas the period when hides and tal- :
low instead of - fruit and grain were;
the staple commodities of traffic here, j
A remarkably dry year is not the ter- I
rible thing in Southern California that \
it was twenty-five years ago, for the !
â reason that the artesian plane has been ;
but little reduced and irrigation here j
has become a science. Thjs end of the ;
State will come out of the season with ;
â â¢5 crop which but for the development i
of water would not bÂ« possible. The j
< :rrus crop will be better and larger â 
than last year and the present rain. If j
followed by others, will insure a fair j
yield cf grain.
Last eight .71 of an inch of rain fell j
here and that was fallowed by a com- i
paratively clear day. Late this after- j
noon rain began falling again and by J
II o'clock to-nigfet .42 of an inch had ;
fallen, making 1.13 inches for the storm. '.
The sky then cleared and at midnight â 
v.as cloudless. In the mountain dis- I
tricts the precipitation v.as much heav- i
ier. seine places reporting as much as j
Z incifcs. The storm swept over this â¢
section and every portion of ;this end!
nf the State received its first good ;
drenching this season. The average !
throughout Riverside and San Bcrnar- i
dino counties was about three-quarters !
of an inch. Orange County had near- j
ly ss much, and San Diegcr County ex- '
reedod half an inch. Coast points j
ranged from forty to ninety hundredths !
nrd to the northward as far as San |
Luis Obispo County there was more I
than an inch and thrice that in the j
mountains. The storm has passed east
and no more rain is promised for the j
present, but enough h?s fallen to glad
den the hearts of the ranchers and to
make possible the sprouting of thou
sands of arres of grain, the seed of i
which was sown in dry soli.

INVENTION MAY ASSIST
IN CURING OF LOCKJAW
Instrument Registers the Minute Dis
charge of Electricity in the
Nerves.
CHICAGO, Feb. 5.â "Capillary elec-*
tronometer" is the name of a new in
strument, delicate enough to register
the minute discharge of electricity in
the nerves and muscles. The invention
will greatly aid in the curing of lock
jaw, it is asserted, and be of great use
in nervous diseases. It is a device con
ceived by research workers in the
physiological laboratory at the Uni
versity of Chicago, its inventors being
C. C. Guthrie, E. P. Lyon and F. H.
Reiske.
A fine glass tube, with a hole in it
no larger than a capillary gland on the
back of the human hand, is the
mechanism of the instrument. The
tube at one end contains mercury,
which penetrates the small extremity
of the tube. The tube rests in a cup of
acid, and the two are joined by platin
um wire.
All life action is chemical and elec
trical, the inventors believe, and by the
action of electrical discharge from mov
ing muscle on the mercury in the tube
the amount of energy expended may be
gauged.
tion up to S o'clock this morning is .9s,
making a total of one inch for the sea
son. The total for last season for the
same period was 8.9*.
SANTA MARIA, Feb. 5.â Since yes
.erday afternoon about an inch and a
half of rain has fallen, making about
two and a half inches the entire season
thus far in this vicinity. The indica
tions are that the storm is not spent,
as a strong southeast wind is blowing.
The rain has greatly reduced the in
tense anxiety felt among farmers and
all classes for weeks past.
BAKERSFIELD. Feb. 5.â The rain
fall here last night was slight; fifteen
hundredths of an inch only fell in
Eakersneid, six at Stockaale and two
at Poso. A heavy snowstorm is going
on in the mountains and at Tehachaiu
the fall will be quite heavy. In the val
les^s the rain was not sufficient to be
of much benefit.
SANTA ANA, Feb. 5.â A precipita
tion of .5S of an inch of rain fell here
last night, commencing at midnight
and continuing three hours. The
moisture is sufficient to start barley,
hundreds of acres of which have been
sown, and will make heavy winter Ir
rigating unnecessary, and may start
grass in pastures, which are now al
most bare. Total for the season Is now
.95 of an inch, which is the least pre
cipitation at this time for twenty
years.
SAN JOSE. Feb. 5.â The rainfall in
tho valley for the last * twenty-four
hours is only .39 of-TLn inch, but both
the Mount Hamilton and Santa Cruz
ranges of mountains, on both sides of
the valley, are covered with snow from
the summits dorrn to the foothills. The
barometer continues low. 23.6.", ii>di
-cating more rain. The wind continues
from the south and the sky is overcast.
SACRAMENTO. Feb. 5.â The rainfall
of yesterday and last night was gen
eral chroujrhout the Sacramento Val
ley and the foothills. The heaviest pre
cipitation in the valley was at Chico,
where 1.32 inches fell. Nearly two
inches Ml in the foothills. The rain
fall to date in the valley is a few inches
less than last season at a corresponding
date. Heavy snowstorms prevailed in
the mountains. During the present
storm twenty-four inches of snow fell
at Summit.
FROST MAY FOLLOW RAIN.
Weatlier Clerk Looks tor Cold Snap
After the Recent Dotvnpour.
The weather throughout Califor
hla was gradually becdroing clearer
last night. The body of the storm
swept eastward yesterday and the lat
est reports at the weather bureau
were to tho effect that Utah and Ariz
ona were getting plenty of wind and
snow. Professor McAdie states that
eastbound travelers are sure to en
counter cold, stormy wenther the
other side of the Nevada Mountains.
The wind attained a velocity of
thirty miles an hour at Modena,
thirty-six at San Diego, twenty-eight
at Phoenix and thirty-two at Yuma.
Fair weather is predicted for to-day
in Central and Northern California
surely, and probably for Southern Cal
ifornia. The temperature wÂ»ll be
much lower and frosts are likely to
visit most of that section of the State
north of Tehachapi. Snow fell yes
terday on Mount TamalDais.
The rain did an imense -amount of
good to the agricultural and livestock
interests. SIcAdie says that morewet
â weather may be expected in the
course of Tour or five days.
( THE SAN FRANCISCO . CALL, SATURDAY. FEBRUARY 6, 1901.
WINNER OF THE CARNOT
MEDAL AND TWO OTHER
BERKELEY DEBATERS.
BERKELEY, Feb. 5.â Joseph P.
Lucey, a student in the Hastings Law
College, yas awarded the Carnot medal
for debating to-night in competition
with five other students, two from the
University of California and three from
Stanford University.
Harmon gymnasium, where the de
bate was held, was crowded to the
doors with the adherents of both sides.
Sections were held by "rooters'* of Cal
ifornia and Stanford, and the yell lead
ers kept them busy with encouraging
yells and songs.
California went into the debate with
some fears for the outcome. It had
three inexperienced men to send against
a team that had two veterans in inter
collegiate debate and a third who had
a fund of experience in secondary
; schools. The general feeling was that
Stanford with its experienced men
woBid sweep to victory. After the first
â¢brush to-night, -however, California's
hopes went up a peg. The forceful and
convincing argument of Lucey, which
none of the Stanford debaters seemed
to equal, turned the fortune of the day.
When the judges finally retired it was
generally conceded among those that
; had followed the argument closely that
Lucey would be the winner.
The question for debate was not an
\ nounced until two hours before the de
bate began. It was then declared to be:
"Resolved, That the French judiciary,
should bÂ« more completely independent
| of both the legislative and executive de-
I partments." .
The debaters had had, however,
ample time to prepare their argument
as tho general subject for discussion,
"The French judicial system," had been
announced several months ago. The
debaters Were allowed to choose their
own sides on the question.
Frank A. ilandel of California chose
the affirmative. Frank Roehr of Stan
ford the negative, Alexander Sheriffs
of Stanford the affirmative and How
ard II. Lewis of Stanford the negative.
Lucy of California the affirmative.
Hart Greensfelder of . California the
negative.
The affirmative side took the ground
that government should be for the pro
tection of 'individual liberty. As it
subserves Individual liberty it should
be preserved. In civilized countries
men look to the courts for this right.
This right cannot be had if the judi
ciary is subservient to the executive,
as it is in France. The administrative
courts, appointed by the executive, do
not amply protect the individual
against the encroachment of the gov
ernment., f
In replying, the tegative declared
that tho administrative courts had
withstood the test of a hundred years
and numerous changes in the char
acter of the Government.' This system
is best fcr the French people. The de
cision not being unanimous, one of the
judges having cast his vote for Lewis
of Stanford. Judge James Seawell of

MAYOR OIiNEY. OF OAKLAND
PLEADS . FOK ARBITRATION"
Delivers Lecture Urging That National
Differences Shall Be Settled With
out Resort to . Arms.
Warren Olney. Mayor of Oakland, de
livered a lecture last night at the
Academy of Sciences Hall. His subject
was "The Future of War."
Frequently the lecturer was applaud
ed during his discourse. The thems of
the lecture was the tendency on the
part of civilized people to discontinue
the practice of fighting and settle na
tional differences by peaceable means.
He detailed the settlements that had
been made between the English and
French and the Prussians and French
within a short period of years, as na
tions are reckoned, and tried to show
that the scarred wounds had been
healed thoroughly by the passage of
years and the salve of the sDirit of
peace.
He deprecated any further war meas
ures oh the part of nations, believing
that all settlements and difficulties be
t'.veen them could- be profitably ad-
Justed by arbitration..
Tom to Join Church.
A way of fortifying New Year's reso
lutions has been propounded by a Ger
man clergyman, who tells this story to
the Philadelphia Record: "I have in
my congregation a young married
woman, who has for some time past
been trying to persuade her husband
to unite with the church. She came
to me the other day and said: 'I think
Tom is now in the proper frame of
mind. If he is going to join the church
at all he must do it at once, or at least
before New Year's day.'. 'And why be
fore New Year's day?' I asked. 'Well,'
said she, . 'I've- done an awful lot of
Christmas shopping : this yea'r at the
stores where we .have accounts, and
when the bills come in at thV first of
the year I think that. If he joints the
church in the meantime, he'll have his
newly acquired Christianity to counter
act'the fit of profanity that he usually
displays when the Christmas bills come
in." " â New York Tribune.
San Francisco announced thedecision.
His colleagues . were Judge Frank J.
Murasky and Judge M. C. Sloss. In
the absence of President Wheeler. Pro
fessor Charles Mills. Gayley presided.
Lucey, the tenth Cafnbt winner, is a

SAYS CATTLE
ARE IMPERILED
State Veterinarian Tells of His
Investigation of Conditions
in Sonthern Tart of the State
LOSS MAY BE VERY- LAEGE
Raisins: of Quarantine He De
clared to Be Necessary to the
Life of the Starving Herds
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 5. â Dr. C. H.
Blemer, State Veterinarian, returned
to Sacramento thus morning from an
investigation of conditions in the
southern part of the State. He re
ports the outlook as discouraging for
the cattlemen. He states that unless
the quarantine against the south can
be lifted, so as to permit the starving
cattle to be brought north, there will
be an immense loss. Already many
cattle have perished from hunger- and
nearly all of those remaining are too
weak to stand shipment out of the
State.
Dr. Blemer said he heard of buyers
from Arizona and Colorado being in
the south, but he expressed the opin
ion that the cattle would not survive
the trip to Colorado, if the authorities
of that State would permit them to
enter. While there is plenty of hay in
Colorado and some in Arizona, the
cost of getting it to the starving cattle
in .the south is too great for the cat
tlemen to think of attempting to save
their herds in this way.
Dr. Blemer said the range stock is
too weak to stand dipping in crude oil,
as advised .bjvSeeretary Wilson of the
Agricultural Department. In any event
this is not ot be considered, in view of
Governor Brodie's telegram to the ef
fec/ that under the statutes of Arizona
tattle from infected districts cannot be
shipped into that Territory.
When told of the protest made to
Governor Pardee by the stockmen of
Solatio and Napa counties against
raising the quarantine against the cat
tle in the south. Dr. Blemer said he
was sorry to hear of it. He declared
there would be no danger in moving
the cattle, as none but healthy stock
would be sent north if the quarantine
were removed. No cattle would be al
lowed to pass to the north unless they
were inspected, he said, and in this
way all cattle infected with Texas
fever would be kept out. He explain
ed that the loss to v the northern cat
tlemen from permitting stock from the
south'to mingle with their herds dur
ing the drought of 1898 was due to the
fact that no inspection was made then.
Now there are strict regulations, by
which all cattle can be inspected be
fore removal and any found to be in
fected will not be permitted to leave
the infected district.
JUDGES DETECT
FALSE PLUMAGE
Reverse Decision .Rendered at
â Utah's Annual Poultry Show
in the C'itv of Salt Lake
Special Dispatch to The Call.
SALT LAKE, Utah, Feb. 5. â Be- j
cause of a feather that happened to |
be in the wrong place the Judges of i
Utah's sixteenth annual poultry show I
have reversed the decision which â¢
awarded to James Gunter of Ogden ;
first prize for the finest specimen of j
the Brown Leghorn breed.
When the experts went'the rounds ]
to judge in this particular class they !
stopped, spellbound with admiration, )
in front of the pit that contained Gun- i
ter's exhibit, a magnificent cockerel j
that strutted about in full realization â¢
of his own beauty. The fowl was j
nearly perfect according to all the '
standards for judging such creatures, j
His plumage was all that could be de- j
sired, particularly his tail feathers. |
which were all <^f a beautiful shade of
brown.
Gunter was promptly awarded the I
first prize. M
On the following day one of the i
judges who happened to pass the j
Brown Leghorn's coop stopped to ad- j
mire the cockerel. There was some* I
thing wrong with the bird; his ap- j
pearance was not at all as it had been
on the day of his triumph. The ex
pert investigated. Inside the coop he
found one of the gorgeous tail feath
ers of the fowl reposing on the floor.
He picked it up and was much as
tonished to find that it bore unmis
takable evidences of man's handicraft.
Then the bird was examined and the
trick was explained.
Originally Mr. Leghorn has sported
a pure \thite tail feather that was
pretty, but which has no business on
a pure bred Brown Leghorn. No
fowl in that class with a white feather
could hope to win laurels at the poul
try show. Accordingly the white
feather was cut off and one of more
suitable hue . substituted. This was
done by means of a toothpick and a
bit of silver wire, a beautiful brown
feather being inserted in the quill, the
stump of which remained in the bird's
anatomy. The work was executed so
cleverly that the trick would not have
been^ discovered had not the trans
plantdd feather in sotne way got loose.
And so, in this borrowed plumage,
Gunter's bird won the coveted prize.
But his triumph was short lived, for
the judges reversed their decision and
awarded the trophy to another ex
hibitor.

BANKS TO LOAN
$50,000,000
Promise to Supply Necessary
Funds to Improve Pennsyl
vania LineJWest of Pittsburg
NEW YORK, Feb. 3.â A syndicate of
New York bankers has agreed to lend
$50,000,000 for the purpose of improving
the Pennsylvania lines west of Pitts
burg and to provide funds for the pur
chase of the Western Maryland Rail
road by the Norfolk and Western a3
part of a plan for the settlement of the
Gould-Pennsylvania ' differences. The
Western Maryland is controlled by
Gould ii. J .ests and Its president. Jo
seph Ramsey Jr.. is president of the
Wabash Railroad.
According to the latest reports the
Wester.* Maryland, which runs from
Baltimore to Williamsport. Md.. and
leases a number of smaller lines, has
outstanding 'about $13,000,000 of com
mon stock and $324,000 of preferred
stock.
While a syndicate member said that
the loan would provide funds for the
purchase of the Western Maryland, it
could not be learned that negotiations
for such a purpose had . been closed
pending the conclusion of the negotia
tions, a denial such as that received
from Philadelphia was not unexpected.
Wall street regarded the statement
that one of the purposes of the loan
was the purchase of the WesteVn
Maryland as very important. The dif
ferences between the Gould-Pennsyl
vania Interests have engaged the at
tention of financiers for months, and
while reports that an adjustment was
under way have been made repeatedly
within the last few weeks, official con
firmation is lackiMg- One of the rumors
in circulation to-day was that the
Pennsylvania, after taking over the
"Westc-T Maryland- would give the
Gould lines a favorable arrangement
for seaboard traffic.
The Pennsylvania will receive the
money April 1 and issue notes bearing
4Â»i per cent interest therefor, the
notes to be 'taken- up in eighteen
i.:onlhs. It 13 not the Intention of the
syndicate which has taken the notes
to offer them at public sale. The price
to be paid for the notes was not made

GAME OF BLUFF

Keveals Interesting 1 Kit gtf
Hi>tÂ«Â»rv in House of Commons
LONDON. Feb. 3.â An interesting bit
of ante-war history was revealed by
the Liberal leader; Sir Henry Campbell-
Bannerman, in the House\f Commons
to-day in the debate on the proposed
amendment to the address in reply to
the speech from the throne. Referring
to Joseph Chamberlain's gibes at tho
attitude of the opposition when Cham
berlain yesterday defended the course
of the Government toward the Trans
vaal. Sir Henry said that when Cham
berlain interviewed him June 2S>, 1SS>,
prior to the war, and asked him if ths
opposition would support the Govern
ment In sending out 10,000 troops to
Cape Colony he (Sir Henry) expressed
surprise, whereupon Chamberlain satu:
"You need not be alarmed. There will
be no fighting. We know these fellows
won't fight. We a/e playing a gafne of
bluff."
As a result. Sir Henry added, the op
position refused to relieve the GoV*cn
ment of any responsibility regarding
the course it chose to pursue.
The statement of Sir Henry wa3
greeted with roars of laughter from
the opposition benches.
Chamberlain in reply said he did not
remember using the word "bluff." His
only object in approaching Sir Henry
was to make sure that ths South AN
rican question should not T^e treated in
a party spirit, so that the Boers might
be convinced of the earnestness of Great
Britain. '>>*: :

OAKLAN'D. Feb. a. â John Carlson of
Berkeley failed to sain his release from
the County Jail to-day on a writ of
habeas corpus. He is accused by
Frank Fagan with having attempted
to shoot him. Carlson claims the pis
tol with which he made a demonstra

therefore no action could lie against
him. Judge Hall decided that Carl
son would have to demonstrate his
contention to a Jury and said a man
xvas a fool to take a chance of getting
shot by drawing a pistol he did not in
tend to use.
Carlson and Fagan had some trou

Berkeley. Carlson claimed Fagan had
been talking about him in regard to
union matters. He resented what he
had heard and went into the store
and drew his pistol, which he flourish

kill him.

CARE IS GIVEN
TO ALL ALIKE
Fabiola Hospital Closes the
3Iost Busy Year in the
History of Its Existence
FOLK HUNDRED FREE CASES
Old Board of Officers and
Directors Is He-elected for
Auol her Year of Work
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1 1 1 8, Broadway, Feb. 5.
The Fabiola Hospital Association
held its annual meeting to-day and the
reports of the officers showed a con
dition of prosperity and work that has
never been equaled before in the his
tory of the hospital. More patients
have been cared for .than in any pre
vious year, and, while the hospital is
in excellent condition, Mrs. John Yule,
the president, made a suggestion that
the emergency fund should be in
creased to at least 530,000 in order to
protect the hospital against fire or any
unforeseen disaster, as the institution
is now run upon the very smallest pos
sible margin.
The annual election resulted in all
of the old officers being again chosen
to fill the places that many of them
have occupied for years, with the ex
ception of Mrs. H. E. Cook, who was
unable to continue her work as a di
rector, her place being filled by Mrs.
R. W. McChesney of Alameda.
Mrs. John Yule, the president, trfld
of the work done by the hospital with
out pay, nearly one-half of the pa
tients treated there having been given
service without cost to themselves.
She said in part:
As you know, we admit and care for thr?e
classes of patientsâ firrt. those destitute and
unable to ray anything; second, those, with
l.rnlted means who are able to pay only a
part of cost, or perhaps Just cost of food
and medicine; third, those able and who do
pay full hoÂ«jiltal rates. All are suffering and
peeking health. All alike are welcome and all
receive tender care. However. I might add.
should it happen that only one bed was va
cs nt in the hospital, with two applying, one
destitute, the other able to pay. other things
iK-inu orjual. the destitute cne would be given
the bed and care, for the one with money could
find care Â« 2 sew he re.
During the year JuÂ«t closed we have cared
Tor 14<)9 patients. 973 regular hospital patients,
1M more than ever before in a single year.
Three hundred and sixty-four out patients. 112
more than last' year, and f=lr.ty-four patients
were cared for by our district nurse.
Of these, <0rt were unable to nay for any
thing and received free tare; 74 of these were
cared for in the hosoital. 281 were out pa
tients. 4r> were cared for by the district nurse:
2fÂ» paid :>art of cost: of these. 107 were reg
ular hoÂ«pital patients. S3 were out patients,
and 1Â» wore cared for by the district nurse.
Of this showing. 32Â» paid Just cost for care;
of these. 294 were regular hospital patients
and 35 were out patients.
There were 471 patients who paid full
charges. Of these. 465 were regular hospital
patients and 6 were out r-atlente.

ANDREW CLUXIE OBTAINS
PART OF BROTHER'S ESTAYE
Court Makes .Order Distributing to
Him $70,000 â Widow Makes First
Appearance in Court.
An. order allowing Andrew J. Clunie
$70,000 out of the estate of the late
General Clunie was made by Judge
Coffey yesterday. The order in no
wise .affects Clunie's standing as a re
siduary legatee under the will of his
brother, neither does it reduce the es
tate to such an extent that in the event
the claims of Florence Clunie to one
half of it is allowed it will not be large
enough to meet the amount of her
claim. It is simply a distribution to
Clunie of part of the money, he would
receive whether or not the widow's con
tention, that the estate is community
property is sustained. Neither .is the
amount ' large enough to mitigate
against the interests of "Jack" Clunie,
the testator's adopted son. Mrs. Clunie
made her first appearance in court yes
terday, though she took no part in the
proceedings. â  - "'"

WOULD INJURE
A SOUND BANK
Dissatisfied Man Sends Out
Telephone Messages Saying
Institution Has Been Closed
IN BEST OP CONDITION
No Kun Is Attempted, hut
the Officials Arc Greatly
Annoyed by the False Kumors
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 5.
Some person with malicious intent
started the rumor to-day that the Oak
land Bank of Savings had closed its
doors. The intent is supposed to have
been a malicious one, because it was
discovered by the bank officials that
during the day telephone messages had
been sent in many directions to that ef
fect, with the apparent desire to injure
the bank.
The story was started by anonymous
telephone messages sent to all of the
newspaper offices in Oakland. These
messages merely conveyed the Informa
tion that the Oakland, Bank of Savings
had closed its doors, and as these mes
sages were sent during banking hours
it took but a very few moments for the
newspaper men to convince themselves
that this was not true. The sender also
telephoned to various, points in .the
West Oakland railroad yards, to the
Judson Iron Works, to merchants all
over Oakland and 'even to individuals.
The story was undoubtedly sent out
with intent to do the bank injury, for
it has been inspected by the Bank Com
missioners within the last few weeks
and was never in sounder condition. W.
W. Garthwalte, the cashier of the bank,
said:
"We have traced this matter and we
are pretty well satisfied that it came
from a customer with whom we had
some differences. Never before in the
history of the bank has it been in
sounder and more prosperous condi
tion." . f

HOWARD TALKS
ON WATER PLAN
Chairman of Bond Committee
- Delivers an Address Before
the Oakland Board of Trade
DEFENDS E3I1NENT EXPERT
Declares That Opponents of
Project Should Show Some
thing: Better or Quit Fight
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
HIS Broadway, Feb. 5'.
John L. Howard, chairman of the
special committee of the City Council,
read a paper to-night, by request,
before the Oakland Board of Trade in
explanation of the business features
of the report recently submitted to the
City Council by the committee on' the
subject of municipal water supply.
Councilman Howard, after briefly re
citing conditions that led to the organ
ization of the special committee and
defending the course of Desmond Fitz
gerald of Boston, one of the committee,
read at length from the expert's re
port, reviewed the Bay Cities' Water
Company offer and reiterated the
statements that the Contra Costa
Water Company's tender of lease and
sale was inspired by, the special com
mittee, and not by President William
J. Dingee of the water company. Con
cerning the plan of arbitration on the
value of the water company's plant.
Councilman Howard vigorously de
fended it. He said:
The committee anticipated and discussed
every question that has so far been raised
concerning the methods to be employed 1n car
rying out its recommendations. It well kne^r
that the signature of the president of the cor
poration did not bind the corporation and that
it constitutes only a moral obligation; that
when the city has chosen Its expert and is
ready to enter into the agreement, which will
be legally prepared to set forth the question
to be submitted to arbitration, the corpora
tion will be called upon to take such official
action as will make the contract legally bind
ing upon the company.
After such contract Is made the actual en
gagement of. the experts will take place, and
if, during the progress of the arbitration,
either side has just and valid reason to fear
unfair treatment the agreement to arbitrate
may be revoked at any time prior to the final
award.
NOT FORCED TO BUY.
Now to the purchase part of the proposition.
The city does not have to buy it unlecs it
v.ishes. It will be no part of the arbitration
agreement that the city is bound to purchase.
It need not even consider the idea of purchase
until after the valuation is announced. But
the water company will In advance agree to
sell at the valuation to be flxed.
Touching a series of conditions
which the committee found as obsta
cles in the way of a $6,000,000 issue of
bonds for a water plant, Mr. Howard
said:
But, .in the midst of all these doubts and
perplexities, let nw point out to you how the
difficulties disappear, under the proposition of
lease with the right of purchase.
The Immediate necessity of providjng in s
bond issue for a water supply passes away.
and the people may take the matter up at
their convenience, therefore we may begin
at once the consideration of the other projects
that seem to be urgently needefc by the city
and demanded by the people.
If the city desires to make the plant pay
for Itself, and not permit the investment to
intrench upon the 15 per cent limitation, then,
under a wise administration, this may be ac
complished during the life of the lease.
While the city is operating the plant It does
not have to consider payment for any enhance
ment in value due to the Increase In popula
tion and of the volume of business. This en
hancement will accrue to it because the price
will be fixed now.
CITY MAY LEGISLATE.
If it desires to ask legislation to enable it to
issue bonds for a revenue yielding and self
supporting property, withont Including those
bonds In the 15 per cent limitation, it may
do so.
Councilman Howard next referred
to the recommendation that the water
rates suit be dismissed, saying the
committee was courageous enough to
make that proposition, because it is in
the interests of economy.
Mr. Howard, in closing, said:
Have the opponents of the committee's rec
ommendations any other solution to offer that,
in the present situation, will better serve the
Interests of the city? If they have, it be
hooves them to submit It. and that quickly.
If they have not, then in this crisis the press.
the merchants and the people should put their
shoulders behind this movement In a united
effort to accomplish something for the good of
Oakland. i '- ' . -: :

To Fight Garbage Law.
OAKLAND, Feb. 5.â pA meeting of
West Oakland citizens at the Aloha
Club was addressed by several speak
ers last night at 1362 Peralta street in
regard to" making a resistance against
the locating of the garbage crema
tory at Twenty-second and Wood
streets. The sense of the meeting was
that the Council had no right to give a
private corporation a monopoly of the
business and that it was against the
interests of the locality to have the
crematory established there.
Says He Took His Own Coin.
OAKLAND, Feb. 5. â Frank Givens.
a porter, was arrested to-day on com
plaint of Daniel Jones, who claims
Givens took $6 from him. Givens says
the money was his own and that after
he had lent It to Jones he took it back
to prevent Jones from losing the coin,
while both of them were on a spree.

tata and Splendid Chorus
of Fifty.

event of more than ordinary interest
will take place next Sunday evening

gems, the splendid barytone solo, "A
New Heaven and a New Earth.'* In

exquisite things in the entire book.

the First Presbyterian Church and
the possessor of .a delightfully full,
rich voice of rare sweetness and fin
ish, will sing' this solo with an ac
companiment by an invisible choir.
There is also a fine chorus of fe
male voices. The last chorus, "Great
and Marvelous Are Thy Works," Is a
magnificent bit and ( a fitting finale to
a composition so uniformly beautiful.

Brown Dexter and Miss Louise Stubbs,
sopranos; Mrs. Gussie Bergman, con

Commissioners A. B. Spreckels, Reu

Altman attended a meeting of the
Board of Park Commissioners yester
day afternoon al the office of the presi
dent of the board. Owing to sickness
William J. Dingce wa s not able to at

reported that the work on Columbia
square recently ordered by the board
v as finished. It was also reported that
the trees selected for the adornment of
the grounds surrounding the California
building at the St. Louis Exposition
were boxed and ready for shipment.
The profits o f the Japanese tea gar
den in Golden Gate Park for the month
of January amounted to 567 92. The
children's playground returned a profit
of $206 12 for the same month. The

ported that Srreckels Lake was very
nearly filled to its full depth and that
model yachts graced the waters.
P. D. Merchant sent a communication

tion of automobiles.
A communication was received from
Stephen G. Byrne, president of the Pre
cita Valley Improvement Club, in which
the statement wes made that condi
tions at Eernal Park were not agreeable
to the people in that locality. It was
represented that there was not a bench
lo eit on. The Commissioners discussed
the features of Bernal Park and sug
pested to the superintendent that the
deciduous trees be removed and aca
cias. Monterey cypress and gum trees
be planted. Two carloads of logs for
benches to supply this and other parks
with seats were ordered.
AUBURY WOULD BORROW.
A letter from L. E. Aubury, State
Mineralogist, requesting a loan from
the Memorial Museum of the statue
representing a California miner was
read ar.d discussed. Commissioner Alt
man remarked that the statue was in
plaster, being a replica of the figure on
the Native Sons" monument. It was
donated to the museum by James D.
Phelan. It was the sense of the com
mission that it should not leave the
museum. Mr. Aubury. representing the
miners, desires to exhibit the figure in

a d'l-?gation from the automobile club
at San Francisco, waited on the com
mission with reference to the Lloyd
Â«Tdinance for the r^r -lation of auto
mobiles :n Golden Gate Park. It was
maintained by the representatives of
the club lhat the automobile should
b* judged on its merits and that con
sideration should be given to those
who respect regulations. The majority
sof automobile owners we~e not scorch

were 500 automobiles in San Francisco
and that 5000 people were using thÂ° ve
hicles.
CLAIM AUTOS ARE SAFE.
It was asserted in the arguments sub
mitted by the delegation that an auto
mobile moving at a speed of twenty
miles an hour was safer than a hor?e
tfrawn vehicle going at eight miles an
hour. An offer was. made to shov.- the
commission how quickly and safely the
priced of the machine could bÂ« dimin

and Central Park. New York. He as
serted that Golden Gate Park was the
pleasure ground of the poor people and
that every precaution for the safety
and comfort of the people should be
observed. He Indicated that he would
not sustain an ordinance granting to
automobile privileges greater than
those allowed at present. Mr. Sullivan
fpoke of his own horses shying at an
automobile. It was suggested by J. D.
Spreeke'.s that the Commissioner should
get an automobile, for it would not
J?hy. Mr. Spreckels asserted that acci
dents in the park incident to the use
of automobiles were very few. Not a
case involving the loss of a single life
has been cited. A point of danger is
the Stanyan-street entrance, but the
automobile men move the vehicles there
through masses of people with such
care that no accidents occur.
The automobile delegation cited In
stances of horse racing 1 in the park that
caused peril to women and children, yet
it was not proposed to exclude horse
drawn vehicles. The representatives cf
the club held that they should not be
excluded from jthe park because irre
sponsible men disobeyed the law. Ar
gument was advanced that the topog
raphy of San Francisco was such that
Golden Gate Park was one of the places
suitable for automobiles.
Commissioner Altman fancied that
police protection was eomething that
the board should consider. He had no
prejudice against the automobile and
would support an ordinance granting
privileges requested, provided police
measures for the enforcement of the
order could be had.
A GOOD ILLUSTRATION*.
Mr. Lowe remarked that the best il
lustration of the safety of the automo
bile was given at the Stanyan-street
entrance, where the machines were
moved through crowds of people.
The delegation retired and the Com
missioners discussed the proposed or
dinance. President Spreckels objected
to that portion of the order granting
automobile privileges on the Overlook
drive.
Commissioner Lloyd said the order
limited the speed on the Overlook
drive to ten miles an hour and to eight
on the curves. On the Great Highway
the speed was limited to six miles an
hour.
It peemed to be the sense of the com
mission that the use of the Great High
way should be extended so that auto
mobiles could reach the Cliff House
from the northerly side of the park.
Four affirmative votes are required
for the adoption of the ordinance, and
modifications seem necessary in order
to obtain this support. It was agreed
thm Mr. Lloyd should provide each
Commissioner with a copy, and such
copy should be amended in the man
ner desired by the Commissioners. A
conference will follow, and. if possible,
an order acceptable to v all will be
framed for consideration at the regu
lar meeting' in March.
The problem of new work in Golden
Gate Park was discussed. The needs
of a new museum or the extension of
the building; now occupied engaged the
attention of the board. It was the
judgment of the board that money was
not now available for this enterprise.
Projects relating to speed track,
athletic grounds and polo fields on the
uestern end of the park were dis
cussed.
On motion of Mr. Lloyd, seconded by
Mr. Sullivan, President Spreckels was
requested to confer with the Polo As
sociation to ascertain to what extent
the polo men would assist in the en
terprise.

thÂ» opinion that the resolution was
necessary.
The board awarded the contract for
a sewer in Cedar street to Fred L*fler
for $1 65 a lineal foot.
The board recommended to the Su
pervisors that grades be changed on

Cannot Find Trace of Gomez.
Andreas Gomez preferred to forfeit
his cash ball of $1350 rather than
stand trial before a jury in Judge Law
lor's court on a charge of grand lar
ceny. He could afford to do it, as he
is still $2400 in pocket. Gomez was
co-defendant with Richards Fernan
dez, who was convicted last week and
is waiting sentence. They gave Can
dido'Garatigui $10. telling him that
?. lottery' ticket he had purchased had
won an approximation prize of that
amount, when it had won a capital
prize of $7500, which they divided.
Gomez's case was again called yester
day and continued for another week.
The Judge was informed that no trace
of him could be found.

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. FEBRUARY 6, 190*.
APPROVES ROOF
GARDEN PLANS
Committee Votes to Place Cafe
Above Exhibits San Fran-
cisco Will Show to World
STRUCTURE WILh BE GAY
Contracts for City Building at
St. Louis Will. Call for
Its Immediate Construction
The committee to prepare a building
and exhibit for the St. Louis .exposi
tion that will be representative of San
Francisco met yesterday and so modi
fied the architectural plan of the mu
nicipal building to be erected as to
provide for a garden and cafe on the
roof. Architect Samuel Newsom sub
mitted a plan for this cafe and garden
on the roof, which was adopted.
To-morrow Mr. Newson will leave
this city to go to St. Louis, where he
will show the management the San
Francisco plans. Unless the stringent
regulations that ,have been adopted
relative to protection from { fire pre
vent, the roof garden feature will go
with the others that have been evolved.
That will give San Francisco a great
advertisement In many ways, so the
executive committee believes.
The structure for San Francisco will
be a glittering affair from foundation
to the top of its 100-foot tower, upon
the apex of which, instead of the cus
tomary eagle, there will be a gold nug
get. Instructions have been received
from St. Louis that this city must have
Its building done by April 30 next, as
it will occupy a place at "the front
door." Consequently next Friday L.
M. King and T. C. Judkins will start
for St. Louis to open bids and award
contracts. Then one of the most showy
structures on the exposition grounds
will arise as fast as the weather will
permit.
IN* PROMINENT PLACE.
'The phrase "at the front door," which
comes from the St. Louis management,
indicates the scenic position that has
been held out to San Francisco. From
the roof garden,* the latest proposed
addition, the most interesting" part of
the whole show will be in sight by day
and by night. The main entrance
crowds will constantly surge by San
Francisco's hospitable portals.
Directly across from San Francisco's
building will be "the pike," the "mid
way" of St. Louis' great show. In full
view from the roof will be the grand
court of honor. Within one square is
situated the great music pavilion, from
which the sound of concerts by large
musical organizations will proceed day
and night.
Directly back of San Francisco's
building will be the splendid Louisiana
State monument. The view will also
take in the grand basin, with night
illuminations.
The buildings surrounding that of
San Francisco will be domed and flat
roofed, so that the sharp tower of San
Francisco's. structure will rise conspic
uously and be seen from all portions
of the exposition grounds.
Below and above the roof garden the
architectural plans embrace a vivid
colc-r scheme. First to be considered
is the base of the main structure, which
will be an ivory white, all sides being
exactly alike. Proceeding upward the
color scheme will be wrought out with
deep crimson shading into light crim
son, then dark terra cotta shading; into
medium terra cotta, then yellow and
above that flame yellow. The tower,
which will be of glass, will repeat the
colors, running the gamut in exactly
the same order .of hues as the sub
structure. There will be electric lights
to throw out into the night the colors
of the gay tower. The structure will
be electrically outlined in part.
The heavy doors will be of ornamen
tal varieties of redwood. From the
tc-wer, from the sides and from the
corners will float the national, bear and
San Francisco flags and exposition pen
nants In profusion, grouped to produce
a carnival effect.
WILL FEED VISITORS.
While the San Francisco building will
house art, music, literature, commerce,
manufacture, Echools and all else that
appertains to San Francisco, In minia
ture representation, the roof garden is
probably as good a feature to draw at
tention and make people remember San
Francisco as any that has been de
vised. It is announced that California
food products will be served and that
a first-class caterer will be employed.
The roof garden will have in the cen
ter a kitchen which will surround the
tower. The entire floor space will be
seventy-two feet square and from this
will be taken room for a stairway and
eighteen feet square for the kitchen.
The remainder will be used for the cafe
and garden. ,
Around the sides will run open ar
bors. Overhead the roof will extend
for some distance from the tower, but
over the arbors â wherein will be the
choice seats for observation while eat
ing San Francisco viands and drinking
California winesâ there will be awn
ings that can be rolled up and lowered,
according to need.
At the corners of the garden will be
roofed booths with* tables for the ac
commodation of parties. In the roof
garden visitors to the San Francisco
building, when they are not looking at
the exhibits, viewing the moving pic
tures of San Francisco or studying its
art, history. Industries, commerce, etc.,
as shown in exhibits, may feast and at
the same time, while resting, see a
wonderful moving spectacle, to be af
forded by the restless life of the expo
sition. At the four corners of the San
Francisco . building will be seats sur
rounding four ornamental flag staffs.
and these will be for the accommoda
tion of the public- The staffs will be
tinted in harmony with the color
scheme of the building.
At tire meeting of the committee yes
terday the following subcommittees
were appointed by Chairman James D.
Phelan: On music, H. J. Stewart and
Shatter Howard; on books, George/ P.
Clark, Fred Teggart, W. R. Williams,
George H. Fitch and Ina D. Coolbrith;
on art. A. F. Mathews, 1^ P. Lafmer.
Robert Aitken and Douglas Tilden. .
Geologists speak of that fraction of
the rainfall which reaches the; sea
through streams as the "run-off .'' The
run-off in Connecticut is half the rain

but one-fourth.
WARRIOR IN CUSTODY
ON CHARGE OF ROBBERY
Former Philippine Defender Accused of Robbing
Martin Steinerâ Seeress Fails to Dodge Things
Coming Her Wayâ Overhaulser Held for Inquiry
Only because he needed the money,
Frank Summers, a discharged soldier,
who spent two years in rounding up
the natives that lived on the borders
of Mindanao Lake and making them
good citizens, followed Martin Steiner
from a saloon at 315 Pacific street.
Steiner had been making a good fel
low of himself around the dance halls
and he looked as if he might be ripe
for; a plucking. .
At the junction of Pacific and San
some streets Summers 'laid vio
lent hands on* the throat of
Steiner, and with . -theV other
mitt he Industriously searched his vic
tim's pockets. â¢ He . secured a gold
watch and $2 50 In money. If there had
been a sack of wheat -or a ton of coal
in Steiner'B pockets Summers would
have secured them, b^ause his search
was thorough. .. ,'t v
"When Steiner was finally released
from the throat-grip and. given an op
portunity to use his pipes , again, he
poured forth an appealing melody in
minors' that brought nearly all the po
licemen in the district to the scene.
Summers had backed into the Head
light saloon at 400 Pacific street and, it
is alleged, he passed the pilfered time
piece to a bartender in the resort, one
Joseph May. May was taken into cus
tody and is now held to allow the po
lice to Investigate his record.
Summers was before Judge Fritz/yes
terday to answer to the charge of rob
bery and after being instructed and ar
raigned was given one week to prepare
his defense.
J. L. Muro was a defendant in Judge
Mogan's court yesterCiy. He was ac
cused of disturbing the peaceful life of
Mrs. Mubo, who runs a fortune telling
joint on Geary street,' near Powell. She
professes "td read your story In the
stars" and the tale she told to him was
of a world he biiilded by his vain de
sires. Also there was a horoscope of
the life when he would arise In a world
of men and strive when the race was
to the swift and the battle to the
strong.
Even under these inducements the
thonsr of "vain, sweet love enthralled
him." He became madly Infatuated
with the seeress arid bothered her for
months. Once before he was arrested
on a similar charge because he insisted
on reviving the knowledge â  she im
parted to him before the. appointed
time had come. He had found his af
finity 2683 years before she was due.
' "When he invited Mrs. Mubo -to sup
per Thursday night she refused to go
with hi.n. Following the refusal came
ethereal water pitchers, subliminary
frc.'-nents of a folding-bed and celestial
reminiscences of a broken mantelpiece,

LYMAN' FOSTER OPPOSES
STEPMOTHER'S PETITIOX
Claims That Widow of the Late Mer
chant Is Well Enough Provided For
Without the Family Residence.
Lyman J3. Foster, son of the late
merchant, Samuel Foster, filed an op
position yesterday to the petition - of
Mary Foster, his stepmother, to have
assigned to her as a homestead the
Foster residence on Washington street.
He claims that it would work an In
justice to him and the other heirs un
der the will of Foster, and says that
without the homestead, which yields
an income of "$85 a month, Mrs. Foster
is already amply provided for.
Foster's opposition sets forth that
under the will of Foster his second
wife will receive a half of the com
munity property and a third of the
separate property of the merchant,
amb-unting in all to $47,500. This sum.
he says, will yield her an income of
$200 a month, in addition to the family
allowance of $200 a month allowed her
by the court. His share of the estate
under the will' Is $95,000. which yields
him an income of almost $400 a month.

â¢â¢.Saints and Angels" 5s the latest j
nickname to be applied to a railroad.
This glorifying pseudonym has been
bestowed upon United States Senator
W. A. Clark's new Los Angeles, San
Pedro and Salt Lake Railroad, now in
process of construction. This road,
â which is only half finished, is designed
to connect Fait Lake Cityâ the home of
the 'Saints 1 â with Los Angeles, Cal.,
the City of the Argels." From the
earliest period in the history of rail
roading ih^re has been a "stove com
mittee" â i. e.. the persons who sit
around the stove in a railroad station
and emit theories, opinions and facts
finent the current topics of the day,
philosophical, political, religious, social
and railroad. This "stove committee"
is responsib'e for most of the nicknames
that the principal railroads in this
country bear to-day.
A quarter of a century ago the pa*
trons of the Delaware, Lacka wanna and
Western Railroad grumbled a great
deal about the dilatory transportation
given them. These grumblers received
a hint from the "stove committee."
and for many years the letters D. L.
and W., painted on the company's cars,
were translated into "Delay, Linger and
Wait." It is scarcely necessary to say
that conditions on this road have
â¢ hanged so materially that the old
nickname has become obsolete. A
roughly constructed road was the old
Indiana, Bloomington and Western.
Sufferers from ague ivere cured of their
malady when traveling on this road by
the familiar homeopathic principle of
"similia similibus curantur." The
favorite joke about this road at one
time was that it n?ed only "to be taken
to be shaken," and the people \vho did
not care to be shaken construed the
initials I. B. and W. into "I'd Better
Walk."
The traveling public generally has an
aversion for long names for railroad
companies. The Connecticut man who
â would waste vocal power on the New '
York, New Haven and Hartford is a i
rare bird. Ask any person who dwells i
within the region traversed by the lines
of that company to designate it and he
will promptly answer "The Consoli
dated." This tfrm of course applies to
the merger of numerous lines by the
act of ci.-nsoiMat.ion passed by the Con
necticut Legislature. In Pennsylvania
who ever hears of tne Pennsylvania
Railroad? It is the "Pennsy," and local
pride has given an unctuous melody to
the name. The "Panhandle" is known
to thousands where the Pittsburg, Cin
cinnati, Chicago and St. Louis is known
to one. The nickname is derived from
the fact that the road crosses the
handle of the pan which the shape of
"West Virginia suggests. >
The name "XIrkel Plate" brings up
recollections of William H. Vanderbilt
and Calvin S. Brie?. The last-named
financial meteor conceived the idea of
paralleling the Lake Shore and thus
bringing "old Vanderbilt" to terms.
Mr. Vandnbilt had to buy the new road
as a matter of s<*If-prot?ction, and when
the. question of . price came up Mr.
Briee"* figures were so high that Wil
liam H. exclaimed with characteristic
vehemence, "Why. your â road mu^t
be nickel p!ated!" And thfc. "Nickel
Plate" it has been ever since. The
West Shr-re Uailroad was purchased by
Mr. Var.derbilt under siml'ar conditions,
and although he storrnrd and fumed
for two or three years against what bo
raJd was "pure blackmail," he gave
nÂ»w meaning to thfc company'? Initials
v.hen hÂ» said "Why. Â«=u: ?," to Mr. De
pew's suggestion, "I think that v.e shall
h3ve to buy this road." >:}:'"
Take the Hould Trroup of railroad?.
What more Figrnifkant nickname could
be devised for Missouri Pacific than
"Mop?" T1i!f. is to-dny the Wall rtreet
name for that great rystem, and while
11 is a natural abbreviation of the "Mo.
P." which appears on many of the
company's car? it is expressive of the
determination of Jay Gould thai he
purposed to rr.op up all th? traffic in
i!iÂ«? Southwest. The term "Cotton Belt"
ns applied to Gould's St. Louis and
f outbv.-entern is far more familiar than
is" the corporate name of the railroad
itself. There are dcubtlers hundreds of
spoct'lslors in Wall street who buy
"Katy" chares v/ho could not tell you
lho full name of the railroad in Jhc
sleek of which they arc speculating.
T:iis nlcknarrc is but Hie natural com
function of the two last initials of the
Missouri, Kansas and Texas.
At one stpge in the history of the
Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific there
was i great deal of complaint that the
movement of trains was slow and un
certcin. This led to the reduction of
the company's corporate designation C.
It. L Â£-. P. to the popular expression
"Cry and Push." A letter received by
the writer recently asked for a defini
tion 'of "Big Four." This Vanderbilt
line, now so energetically managed by
President M. E. Ingalls, is known . of
ficially es the Cleveland, Cincinnati,
Chicago and St. Louis. It takes its
present short name because of the con
solidation several years ago of four im
portant lines, as follows: Cincinnati,
Indianapolis. St. Louis and Chicago;
Cleveland. Columbus. Cincinnati and
Indianapolis; Indianapolis and St.
Louis, and the Cincinnati, Sandusky
and Cleveland railroads.
"Why the Clover Leaf and the Maple
. - - â  .
. â â â v
Leaf?" somebody may ask. Simply be
cause each of these lines, as drawn on a
map, forms the main arms or arteries
of the leaf named. The Clover Leaf is
the Toledo, St. Louis and Western, and
the outlines of its route present an ex
cellent picture of a clover leaf. The
Chicago Great Western, which is
known as the Maple Leaf, has its heart
in the stem and three important ter
minal points all within the frame of a
maple leaf.
Among old railroad men perhaps the
most familiar nickname is "Coffee,
Cakes and Ice Cream," which applied
to the Chicago, Columbus and Indiana
Central, now part of the Panhandle di
vision of thp Pennsylvania Railroad
system. This is something like "Brandy
and Soda," by which pseudonym the
Buffalo and Southwestern was known
before its absorption by the Erie Rail
road.
Freaking of the Erie, there are sev-j
eral nicknames that come to mind, but
they arc mostly ephemeral. The pres
ent generation scarcely remembers
"Fisk's Highway" and "Gould's Own,"
but the name that still sticks to a part
of the Erie system is "Xypono." This
is an abbreviation of the name of the
eld railroad company, Now York, Fenn
yylvania and Ohio. Any person who
writes X. Y.. P. and O. will clearly see
the excuse for this abbreviation.
There Is one railroad that certainly
deserves its nickname, and that is the
'Little Giant"â the Pittsburg and Lake
Erie. This road, running out of Pitts
burg, has returned to its stockholders
a greater amount of revenue â mileage
considered â than any other railroad in
this country. Its earnings have been
at times phenomenal.
Mcimmoth's Extinction.
BY G. FREDERICK WRIGHT. A. M.. U* D.
Author of "The .Ic-e Age in North Amcr-
(Copyright. 100*. by Joseph B. BowlÂ«.)
In 1839 Dr. Koch of St. Louis gave J
an account in the Journal of Science
of the discovery of the skeleton of a
mammoth in Gasconade County, Mo.
(fifty or sixty miles above St. Louis),
which showed clear evidence that man
had aided in the killing of the animal.
At the same time some one attempted
to throw doubt upon thi-* description,
but subsequent discoveries render it
perfectly credible. The skeleton was
found, as usual, in a peat bog, in which
there had been a considerable ac
cumulation of vegetable mold, blue
clay and sand, and was about five j
feet below the surface. Beneath this
sketelon was an Indian spearhead and
a stone ax of unique patteAi; also
ashes and pieces of burnt wood and
burnt bone. There were also pieces
of rock, weighing from two to twenty
five pounds, which were scattered as
though they had been thrown at the
anjmal^ The hind and fore foot were
stllf preserved, together with pieces of ]
the skin. Dr. Koch supposed that the
animal, having become mired in the
mud. was attacked by men, who thus
aided in his destruction.
These facts give point to the ques
tion put to me by the distinguished
Professor Schmidt three years ago in
St. Petersburg, when I asked him con
cerning the cause of the destruction
of the mammoth. He said: "Are you !
Mire that man did not have a good
deal to do with it, as he had with the
destruction of the buffalo and other ,
animals?" Xevertheles, one cannot
but feel that this destruction has been '
too widespread and on too large a scale
to have been much affected by the
agency of man. It seems more likely
that eiimatic changes have been the
principal agency in the destruction,
and that these changes were not from
increasing cold, but rather increasing
warmth.
The mammoth, as we have seen, was
abundantly supplied with fur, which
shielded him from the effects of cold.
He lived on the vegetation that grows
In semi-Arctic regions. It is very like
ly that the amelioration of climate,
which followed upon the close of the
glacial period, produced conditions to
which the species could not readily
adapt itslef.
It is astonishing what small things
in nature arc oftentimes destructive
of life. The cattle are driven off from
large arer\s in South Africa by the at
tacks of a little fly which swarms In
the region. Grizzly bears in Alaska
arc often killed by mosquitoes!.. The
mosquito attacks tho eye, which is
the weakest point, and the bear, in
attempting to kill the mosquito with
his paw, scratches his own eyes out
and becomes blind. Thus the devel
opment and multiplication of some
insignificant enemies of the mammoth
ps the climate grew warmer may have
been fatal to his existence.
There is, however, much evidence
that th? mammoth became extinct in
many places because his- instincts
ceased to be an unfailing guide amid
the changing conditions which fol
lowed tho close of the glacial period.
Dr. Robert Hell, from his wide ex
perience, has suggested a theory'
something Â»s follows: Tho mam
moth was in tho habit of seeking
shelter within the forest lino during
v.inter. and . with the opening of
spring migrated ' to thâ¢ timberless
country of the north, where/he could
browse en thÂ« small trees which lino
tho river courses of the Arctic Ocean.
These habits could not always become
fixed, the animals could not always
I perceive the dangers connected with
the change in climate conditions and
would sometimes be too far away on
the approach of winter Successfully
to rench safe winter quarters. In this
csse they might be caught in the, early
winter storms or attempt to cross an
ice covered body of water before it
was sufficiently strong to bear them!
Dr. Bell relates that on an island'
in Dngava Bay a whole herd of rein
deer perished from starvation during
one storm when a heavy snowfall was
followed by rain which formed a
cruEt, thus cutting off the supply of
moss. The Island was never restocked
afterward. Such may . have been the
means by which large herds of the
mammoth were destroyed in northern
regions. Stockmen in the West, as
well as in' Siberia, often now suffer
great loss from these storms of sleet,
which form such a crust over /the
grass that the animals are unable to
procure the nutriment that is almost

PUBLIC SCHOOL INSTRUCTION.
W'HEREVER there is a public school there is
a problem and a multitude of, persons ready
to instruct the teacher how to solve it. In
this country we . have a large number of educational
conferences every year and at each of them there are
numerous speakers to point out evils in the existing
courses and methods of instruction. A similar condi
tion of affairs prevails wherever there arc free schools
and free speech, and doubtless will continue to prevail
to the end of time. The instruction that suits one age
and one locality does not suit another; so that except
in countries where bureaucratic government obtains, and
where fixed systems of instruction are arranged for
whole nations, it is not likely there will ever be agree
ment as to what instruction should be given, or how.
Time was when educators believed that a few things
well taught are more profitable than many things half
taught. "Those were the days when men talked much
about '"the man of one book," when great stress was
laid upon the fact that a "Jack of all trades" was "master
of none." To-day some of the foremost educators teach
the opposite doctrine. They would have the public
schools give a smattering of well nigh everything,
leaving it for the pupil to determine later in life what
special study ,or trade he would follow, and then perfect
himself in it after leaving the lower schools. Such
views are held not only in this country, but in so con
servative a land as Great Britain; and among those who
teach them is no less a per?on than Sir Oliver Lodge,
principal of Birmingham University.
At a recent conference of the Teachers' Guild of
Great Britain, Sir Oliver was the principal, speaker. In
reporting the event the London Daily News says:
"Sir Oliver approved of a person having a smattering
of a large number of subjects, and gave the Greek
alphabet as one of the things that everybody should
know. The early outline of nearly everything could be
acquired quite easily, but before a subject Was gone
into beyond this rudimentary stage it should be con
sidered whether the circumstances and ability of the
pupil were such as to make it likely that he would pursue
the subject to a useful, practical end. * * * In his
concluding remarks, Sir Oliver Lodge spoke of the im
portance of teaching courtesy in the use of the streets
for driving and walking, politeness to each other, meth
ods of life saving, the avoidance of panic in casi; of fire,
the advantages and objects of municipal government,
how to preserve the teeth, how to breathe, cleanliness,
the evils of expectoration and other foul habits, and the
proper care of the body."
A public school curriculum, including everything from
the Greek alphabet to the care f the teeth, would cer
tainly have scope enough to satisfj' almost any one. It
appears from the statements of Sir Oliver that at pres
ent the public schools of Great Britain are doing hardly
anything worth doing. The report quotes him as saying
that a majority of the schools turned out boys who
were, ignorant, who did not. know how to acquire knowl
edge, who. found no interest in it, and did not respect it
â who were not ashamed of their ignorance, anq\. were
usually not' even aware of it. " Wliat he desired to see
was th'at the whole processes of instruction should be
overhauled, . the methods studied, organized and made
efficient, and the work conducted by trained and en
franchised teachers under improved conditions.
In this country we are better satisfied with our school
system. Our reformers go no further than to advocate
a little tinkering here and there; the most radical among
them would probably be startled by a proposal of any
such radical programme as that of the principal of Bir
mingham University. It seems the only things Sir
Oliver would have taught up to a utility point in the
public schools are modern languages. He cites the fact
that Nansen was able to lecture in English, French and
German because he had been taught those languages in
the public schools of his country, and he recommends a
similar careful training in British schools.
A German Princess, a trifle derelict in those obliga
tions that debtors owe to creditors, was accused of fraud
the other day and promptly acquitted. There are some
plebeian traits which those of aristocratic blood may
still display without the customary consequences. The
Princess, however, will have to fortify her credit with
cash.
THE ,KENT/UCKY WAY.
FOLLOWING close upon Governor Bcckhain's
vindication of his State against aspersions upon
its' fair fame for law, and order, comes a lively
atlair in L'ctckcr County, which seems to cail for a spe
cial and explanatory message from the. executive. The
-Associated Presto reports that a committee from the
Cumberland Mountain waited upon Mrs. Mullins in the
shank of the evening and denuded her of garments and
whipped her on the bare back until she became uncon
scious under their admonitory attentions." They then,
rubbed salt into the gashes cut by their whips, and
were preparing to return to their mountain homes,
equipped with the consciousness of dut}' clone, when they
were beset by an adverse party, headed by a brother-in
law of the disciplined lady.'
In the ensuing battle this relative and a member of
his party were killed, but their side captured two of the
party of admonition t from Cumberland Mountain. The
captors were versed in the lav/ and knew they must
have evidence. The question was how to secure it.
They could sec guilty knowledge trying to hide in the
heads of their two prisoners, and decided to extract it,
if possible; While the process they adopted is open to
condemnation as primitive it must,, by all, thinking men,
be approved as effective. They tied . the witnesses to
green hackberry trees, and omitting the formality of an
oath, made them tell the truth, the whole truth and noth
ing but the truth by kindling lire under them. They
were not half baked before they revealed the whole plot
and the names of their accomplices.
The names of; these two heated -witnesses are "-iven
as' Bill Haley and Hooker Smith. It. is to be regretted
that the account stops with their. testimony. There will
always be curiosity to know whether Bill and Hooker
were put back over the fire and cooked until they were
done. It is only said that,' the judicial cooks immediately
started after the mountain men and that another battle
is expected. All Kentucky waits fpr news from the
front. The account is not illuminated by any reason for
the desire of the men of the mountain to peer and
pickle Mrs. Mullins. The f^rct that ' her relative and
neighbors rallied in her defense is circumstantial evi
dence that she was approved : of in the community of
which she was probably an ornament.
It may be that time, in these long,!. wintry nights,
hangs heavily on the men of Cumberland Mountain, and
they go to the lowlands for amusement, carrying salt
and switches along* to use as dictated by their desire to
We freely admit that the White Caps of Indiana have
sometimes enforced discipline in the country by the
same method?, omitting the salt, and we have no desire
to gird at Kentucky, which is a* great State. We rather
exalt her above Indiana by reason of the new rules of
evidence enforced by her lowland people, which quite
shame Mr. Greenlcaf and his book on evidence. We do
this, be it understood, without indorsing the Kentucky
way, which is merely interesting because of its piquant
Within the classic shades of Berkeley there is no
place wherein offenders against the peace and dignity of
the scholastic community may be imprisoned pending an
inquiry into their conduct. Some towns,. like some build
ings, otherwise complete and good to look upon, are
sometimes constructed without the most necessary ad
juncts to comfort, convenience and utility. Berkeley
ought to have a jail e.vcn as a sop to tradition.
THE INFLUENCE OF HEREDITY-.
PROFESSOR FKANK W. BANCROFT of the
University of California has just made a remarka
ble contribution to scientific knowlcdgo by deter
mining the ratio in which pigmentation in rabbits is in
herited. In other words, given a piebald bunny and a
calico "jack" and Professor Bancroft will compute to
the decimal part of an inch just how their progeny will
be striped or ringed with nature's dun shades. He
redity is reduced to a formula of logarithmic precision
in the case of rabbits. 'â '{'
Hardly a month passes over this wise world of ours
but sonic deeper and keener solution of the riddle of life
is pronounced and we are nearer to the answer to the ;
everlasting "Why" by just that much. Our scientists!
with their ova of sea urchins and their vertebrae of sala
manders are hewing the way to that millennium of i
thought when everything will be knowable. All honor i
to these pioneers of knowledge. |
There is a new and entirely untrodden field open, how
ever, to the scalpel and the microsco. e\ Its importance
is growing with each recurrent sun. The possibilities
for remarkable achievements therein are enormous. The
hardy adventurer who first sets his foot in this terra in
cognita will not only win the plaudits of the erudite but
the encomiums of a grateful nation. Severe.^ his task,
but manifold the rewards. It is to trace the effects of
heredity in the Democratic party; it is to prognosticate
the prodigy which is to be born of the St. Louis con
vention.
The Berkeley professor had but to account for the
prenatal influences of two rabbits to determine whether
the young bunny, their offspring, was to be of paternal
similitude or favoring the distaff side of the household.
He was, sure that it would be a rabbit at least. Equally
certain' was he that it would be possessed of a brain,
though it were the humble* cerebellum of the rabbit kind,
and that it would be endowed with the power to live,
move and have its being. Not only that but the college
scientist could chart to a nicety th? delicatej>lending of
light and shade which would characterize the future ad
dition to the rodent world. * .
Well might the trembling scientist gaze 'with fear upon
the stupendous task of formulating the results of pre-'
natal influences in the Democratic platform which is' to
be. First there is the insistent influence of the Jeffcr
sonian Democracj', which haswbecn sending its strain
down' through the generations, suddenly to be made
manifest in that wild sport of nature, the Kansas City
platforfh. Added to this blood infusion there is the
rank reversion to a primitive type, personified in William
Jennings Bryan, lately returned from appearing before
all the crowned hcr.ds of Europe. \
The shadow of free silver and the haunting vision of
wild-cat Popocracy appear to the delicately adjusted mi
croscope which is turned upon this field. Add to these
hereditary influences the Sphinx shadow of a\Cleveland,
the man of the Old Guard, the prophetic utterances of a
Gorman and the notably shy and unobtrusive advances
of a He'arst â all of these entering into the spawn of the
St. Louis convention â and who can venture the wildest
guess as to the fearful monstrosity which will see the
light as the result of those birth throes? Who will even
dare to venture that this thing which is born will have
the stamina, inherent within its conglomerate self, to
survive even until weaning time in November?
With ali due respect to the erudition of the Berkeley
scientist it must be granted that his task was child's play
in comparison with that of the much needed political
viviscctor and obstetrician.- -

Harvard University is carrying into practical effect a
plan to preserve in the phonograph the voices of the

that of all thq physical, attributes of* man science has

apparently the most ephemeral, and intangible â the
voice. ?/*â 'â '':

In the crash of a demoralized market the other day

TALK OF THE TOWN
AND TOPICS OF THE
TIMES
His Image.
Marked with the indisputable evi
dence of an encounter with John Bar
leycorn and a hard fist, he ambled
into- a Mission drug store for relief.
His eyes were half cloned, there was
a wandering, bleeding laceration
across his forehead, his nose was tilt
ed to one side and a sash in one
cheek completed the damage.
The druggist cheerfully replied that
he would fix up the caller.
"Wait a minute." said the apothe
cary, as he reached for the gauze, the
lint and the antiseptic. The badly
marred customer disconsolately saun
tered about the shop, but suddenly
stopped in front of one of those con
vex mirrors that do such queer tricks
of distortion with their reflected im
ages.
Our friend caught a glimpse of
himself out of those disturbed optics.
With a yell of terror he tore himself
loose from the scene and bolted for
the door, scaring the druggist half to
death.
"Come back here," shouted the
drug clerk. â¢ .
"Not much," almost shrieked the
fleeing man. "I Just saw myself in
your looking glass and* if I don't get
to a doctor I'm ruined for life.
And he did not stop for explana
tions.
Don Quixote Oneal.
On one occasion in the State Senate
Senator John F. Davis of Amador was
speaking in his usual graceful and
forceful way in favor of a measure to
which Senator Louis Oneal was op
posed. Davis had spoken for some time
and had been interrupted frequently
by questions from his colleague of the
"prune belt." Finally, at the close of
one of the Amadorian statesman's best
periods, came the rasping request, "Will
the Senator permit another question?"
lie would. The question was pro
pounded, and, of course, it carried with
it a suggestion of weakness in Judge
Davis' bill. Thereupon that gentleman
rather testily exclaimed, "Oh, the Sena
tor from Santa Clara Is charging wind
mills!" Instantly Oneal replied, "Yes,
I admit that the Senator from Santa
Clara is charging at least one wind
mill!" And the eloquent orator was
forced to join in the general laugh at
his own expense.
Mother's Affection.
The warrant charging the young man
with being insane was sworn to by
his father and mother, an aged Ger
man couple. As they affixed their sig
natures to the big official looking docu
ment which branded, their only boy
as one bereft of reasc-h great tears
coursed .down their wrinkled cheeks.
The mother seemed particularly affect
ed, and it was with, great clifnculty.that
the Lunacy Commissioners were en
abled to learn from her the history of
her boy's mental condition.
At last the preliminary examination
was over and the aged couple was
brought to the cell occupied by their
son to assist further the examination
by the doctors. They saw their only
child strapped to a narrow iron cot,
his puny limbs bound together by cruel
looking leather bands and his hands
incased in big, ugly looking gloves. The
sight proved too much for the father
and he hastily left the cell. Not so
the mother. With a cry of anguish
she threw herself beside the form of
her boy. calling him "her pet," "her
darling." and other endearing names
which a mother knows.
Then she turned to the doctors and
cried in her broken English: < "Doctor,
doctor, my j boy is not crazy: he Is
only sick. He is a good boy. I do not
want to send him away. I must take
him home again."

Street-car Manners.
There is a universal rule that a man
seated in a street car should arise If
necessary and give his seat to a wo
man. The reasons for such a rule are
self-evident, and If a man care to merit
the respect of others he will follow it.
It is one of the sacrifices to the weaker
sex that he is required to make. Women
have come to recognize this rule or
custom as a right, and often complain
if it be not .strictly followed. But. there
is another side to the case, and It is
this: Because a man is expected freely
and pleasantly to relinquish his seat to
a woman, is there not an obligation
upon her to allow him seating room
when It is easily within her power to do
so? And may not the cause why some
men do not recognize the custom as a
right be the treatment they have re
ceived at the hands of women who have
failed In this regard?
On the outside of the sm'-ller electric
cars of this city there; are ,'<nilt seats
intended for three people, .Â«t how
often is It seen that two womn. evi
dently intent on occupying the greatest
possible space for the least possible
fare and utterly oblivious of the com
fort of others, spread themselves over
the entire space. Unfortunate man,
\vistfully eying the coveted seat gone
to waste, is left to stand and sway
whither the jolting, car listeth, without
even a strap to hang to â for the placing
of straps, sadly needed In that part of
the car, has apparently never yet been
thought of. *
Man is human, and being human Is
sometimes tired. Yet In the instance
spoken of it Is very awkward for him
to ask a woman to move up, although
he unquestionably has a right to do so
under * such circumstances. On many
of the lines in San Francisco during the
busy- hours the street car facilities are
woefully inadequate, and for a. man
traveling to and from his work during
those hours a seat i3 a rarity. Fre
quently he does not obtain one for days
at a time, although there Is a presump-
! tlon that he is entitled to the seat for
which he has paid hl3 fare. â -.-.._ '
If women would remember that It is
no more than fair that they be a little
thoughtful of the rights of men and
move into the space it is intended one
person should occupy, it is possible
they would not so often have occasion
to complain of lack of gallantry on tne
"Don't Forget."
Many years ago, writes Thomas
Bailey Aldrich in "Ponkapog Papers,"
a noted Boston publisher used to keep
a large memorandum book on a table
in his i private office. The volume al
ways lay open and was in no manner a
private affair, being the receptacle of
nothing more important than hastily
scrawled reminders to attend to this
thing or -the other.
It chanced one day that a very young,
unfledged author passing through the
city looked in upon the publisher, who
was also the editor of a famous maga
zine. The unfledged had a copy of
verses secreted about his person. The
publisher was absent, and young Mil
ton sat down and waited.
Presently his eye fell upon the memo
randum book, lying there spread out
like a morning newspaper, and almost
in spite of himself he read. "Don't for
get to see the binder," "Don't forget to
mail E. his contract," "Don't forget
H.'s proofs." and so forth.
An inspiration seized upon the youth. #
He took a pencil and at the tail of this
long list of "don't forgets" he wrote,
"Don't forget to accept A.'s poem."
He left his manuscript on the table
and disappeared. That afternoon when
the publisher glanced over his memo
randa he was not a little astonished at
the last item, but his sense of humor
was so strong that he did accept the
poemâ it required a strong sense of
humor to do thatâ and sent the lad a
check for it, although the verses remain
to this day unprinted.
English Railroads.
There Is a popular belief in this coun
try that American railroads are r..ubh
superior to those in England, both in
equipment and in administration. Sid
ney Brooks, writing in the current Har
per's Weekly, takes exception to this
opinion, and makes some Interesting
assertions to prove its fallacy. The
equipment of the American railroads,
says Mr. Brooks, is far behind that of
the English lines. In England there
are 9S locomotives for every 100 milÂ«s
of railroad, and in America 20; 307 pas
senger vehicles per 100 miles "In Ens
land, and 18 in America; 3161 freight
cars per 100 miles in England, and only
719 in America. The smallest villages
are provided with "well built, comfor
table stations and generally with as
phalt platforms; and a comparison of
the casualty statistics of England and
the United States shows an immense
percentage in favor of the English man
agement.

VALUES WIFE'S
LOVE HIGHLY
George W. IJislop Sues Henry
Brown for $50,000 for Alien
ating: His Spouse's Affection
CHARGES BASE DECEPTION
Avers the Defendant by Gifts
of Money and Dresses and by
Lying Broke Up Happy Home
George "W. Hislop. a merchant, values
the affections of his wife Louisa, to
whom he was married in Canada in
1SS7, at $30,000. In a complaint for
damages filed by him late last night he
asks the court to compel Henry A.
Brown to pay him that amount, alleg
ing that Brown, by trick and artifice,
has 'won the love of Mrs. Hislop and
catrsed her to leave him. her three chil
dren and her heretofore happy home.
Hi.'Iop's complaint is a veritable tale
of wee. It recites that he was married
in Winnipeg. Manitoba, Canada, just
seventeen years ago. Xine years ago
he came with his wif? and one child
to this city zfr.d embarked in business.
Two more children, a pretty little boy
end a girl, were born to them here, and
their Upi was a happy one. Two years
ago, charges Hislop, came the first rift
in their hr.ppy married life and upon
Brown, the defendant in action, a mu
tual friend of himself and his wif>\ and
companion of his children, he lays the
blame.
Hi?!op alleges that Brown first came
I between him and his wife in 1902. His
J attentions caused the plaintiff to wor
â  ry, and soon placed him in such a state
tha.t he spoke to his wife about Brown,
and he says he even went to the latter
and requested him to cease paying at
tention to the mother of his children.
But, says Hislop. it was all in vain.
Crown continued showins his regard
for Mrs. Hisiop, and, avers the plain
tLf, by Insinuations and insidious
wiles, soon caused them to become cool
toward each other.
The trouble culminated, says Brown,
in Xovenber, 1902, when he and his
wife acreed to separate, and from that
time on a divided household took the
place of the cozy home they had es
tablished at 1031 Haight street. For
a month, says Hi?lop, he stood the new
order of things and then sought a
reconciliation with his wife. "I would
have succeeded," he says=, "but for
Brown. He by falsehool and other
means prevented my wife from fol
lowing the dictates of her heart. De
spite my protests and my appeals to
my wife she accepted his advice and
counsel, and Instead of a reconcilla-
I tion our separation grew more com
plete.
"I begged him," says Hislop, "to
refrain from making her gifts, but my
appeals were useless, and on the 13th
of December my wife filed a suit for
divorce. Humiliation and disgrace
followed her* appeal to the courts. Her
society was denied me even to a
greater extent than before; ehe re
fused me her love, and has* ever since
I refused It. notwithstanding that I
i beg&ed of her. because of our three
children, the eldest of whom is 14 and
| the youngest 6 years of age, to pay no
heed, to forget our differences, send
Brown on his way and once more be
come the happy wife and mother she
was before Brown crossed her path."
Hislop's complaint closes \vith the al
legation that on January 1, 1903, Brown,
by gifts of money, jewels, dresses and
furniture and by a lavish expenditure
of money in taking her to restaurants
and all sorts of amusements, caused
Mrs. Hislop to' forget all and leave
home, husband and children, at 1031
Haight ftreet, and take up her resi
dence with him at S01 Clayton street.
He asks the court to award him $50,
000 damages for the loss of his wife's af
fections, for an injunction restraining
Brown from further interference in his
family affairs and for such other relief
as the court may deem fit to grant.
fayt had to pay the bills at the hotels
and the personal expenses incurred by
his Highness.
"Don't v.-orry." was the consoling re
mark made by the Vizier through his
interpreter when Clerfayt, finally grow
ing fearful of the prospect of a settle
ment of his own account as well as
tbat of the railroad company, mildly
suggested to his distinguished charge
that reimbursement should be made at
once. "Give me a memorandum of what
you have spent and I'll forward it from
Cherbourg," continued the Vizier, but
the natience of Clerfayt had reached
the limit and he demanded an imme
diate settlement, whereupon the Per
sian reluctantly drew $200 from his
clothes, where he had had it concealed,
and turned !t ever to his escort. Seven
hundred more was, however, needed,
but the Vizier could not produce it.
When the party arrived at New York
and proceeded to board the awaiting
steamer th" troubles of the Vizier and
his guide reached a climax. The steam
ship agents refused to permit the Per
sians to go aboard until their tickets
had been produced for Inspection. Of
course, they hed none, and finally a
number o? Persians who had gathered
at the dock to see the ex-Vizier off for
Europe dug down in their jeans and
produced $1500. It was turned over to
Clerfayt, who hurriedly made good the
amount of fares demanded by thp
steamship company, and quickly bid
ding his Hizhnes adieu hastened up
town to the Union Pacific Company
with the balance of -the fund contrib
uted and settled for the tickets pur
chased in this city. Even then Clerfayt
figured that he was still out Just $263.
but fortunately the' Persian had given
him a card upon which he had con
fessed owing this sum. and it was
promptly forwarded to the Persian
Minister at Washington, who has since
wired to the railroad agent that his
claim will be paid and that a check for
the amount Is now on its way to this
city.
Clerfayt says he Is done with Persian
Viziers. Asked yesterday when he ex
pected to receive his promised decora
tions from the Orient, he replied with
a contemptuous "Bah I" and produced
two small Persian coins about the size
of an American penny, the only souve
nirs of his overland experiences with
the Shah's former right-hand man.

FORTNIGHTLIES
DANCE AT THEIR
LAST ASSEMBLY
By Sally Sharp.
The eighth season of the Fortnight
lies' pleasure giving ended last night
in a dejjghtful dance in the white and
gold ballroom at the Palace â and the
season thus closed will linger long in
the memory as one of the mostjjril
liant of its long career. There was.
however, a negative note in the cheery
greetings of the receiving party, owing
to the absence of the organizer of the
club, Mrs. Munroe Salisbury, to whose
tact and executive force the Fortnight
lies owe their supremacy.
At the two last balls. Mrs. Salisbury
was unable to leave her apartments,
but it was thought that last night she
would resume her place at the head of
the receiving line. That, however, was
deemed unwise, owing to her ill health,
and her two charming daughters, Mrs.
T. Danforth Boardman and Mrs. Alex
ander D. ICeyes, received in her stead.
In the receiving party were many of
the patronesses â Mrs. Carter Pomeroy,
Mrs. Gordon Blanding, Mrs. Carter
Pomeroy, Mrs. Eleanor Martin and
Mrs. Hyde-Smith.
While the attendance was hardly up
to the standard â owing to the fatigue
induced by the -mad social whirl of the
searcr.â (even the men are beginning to
be the worse for wear, and frankly say
so) the maids and matrons were very
fair and distingue as they whirled
through the mazes of the dance.
As to the gowns â many of them were
exquisite, though new â real crisp new â
Â£own3 v.ere conspicuously absent. But
what wonder, at the winter's end, and
th<=> hibernating season so close at
hand! *
The guests last night were not seri
ously embarrassed for floor space â to
the joy of the rabid two-stepper. Room
there was, and to spare, but a prettier
ball, for a small one, has m* been seen
this fortnight.
Supper wa.s served in the ,Maple
Room, whore the tables, bare of flow
ers, glistened and glittered as is the
wont of crystal and silver.
. As at all the Fortnightly functions,
the music was a joyâ a joy to the
dancers and to those who sat by.
The conservatory room held the
punch bowl, instead of being located
in the vestibule, and was a delightful
innovation â one which might to ad
vantage bo followed by -other dance
givers.
And thus c!ose3 a successful season
of the fun-loving Fortnifrhtlles. May
the next season be as full of pleasure.

RUSSELL II. CO.WVELL
GETS 3IUCII APPLAUSE
Large Audience Is Entertained and
Instructcdjfby lecture of the
Gffted Divine. -
Rev. Russell H. Conwell delivered
an intensely interesting lecture on the
subject "Acres of Diamonds" before
an 'audience of 500 people at the
Young Men's Christian Association
auditorium last evening:. He aimed
to# show that each one of iÂ£a is lit
erally surrounded with opportunities
to enrich himself financially. The
poor, he explained, are simply so be
cause of their own mental or physical
indolence.
As the speaker has proved himself
successful in war. in literature, at the
bar, in the pulpit, on the platform and
as an educator his remarks carried
with them great weight. Greater
ths.n all he is a conscientious ex
pounder of common sense.
His address was brim Hull of humor,
with an occasional touch~"\)f the pa
thetic. The audience showed' its ap
preciation even of the frequent scath
ing criticisms of California and CaJi
fornians with enthusiastic applause.
The proceeds of the lecture are to
be given by Dr. Conwell to a poor
young man who is endeavoring to se
cure an education.

BOY BURGLARS
LAND IN JAIL
Youthful Thieves, Responsible
for Crimes on North* Beach,
Are Taken to the City Prisou
ONE IS STILL AT L'ARGE
Five- Business Houses Are En
tered Within the Last Two
Weeks and Loot Is Taken
Robprt O'Connell, Alf Dollfa and
Charles Champagne were arrested and
lodged in the City Prison last night.
The youths are members of a gang of
bold burglars that has been terrorizing
the North Beach section of the city for
the last month. There is still another
member of the gang at large and as
soon as he Is apprehended charges of
burglary will be entered against the
four.
The criminals, none of whom are over
IS years of age, were not content in
the work, of theft, but malicious mis
chief marks their trail. In one instance
where a butcher shop was broken into
the meat that' could not be carried
away was \ thrown to the floor and
trampled in the sawdust.
About two weeks ago a series of
thefts com"menced. The drug store cf
Parrone & Hardy at Greenwich, and
Mason was robbed and on the same
right an attempt was made to get into
the business house cf Jacob Rehm Jr.
at 731 Montgomery avenue. Two nights
later a i^Jridow in the rear of E. Mala
testa's grocery was forced with a "jim
my" and a quantity of groceries taken.
Then followed the burglary in a butch
er shop at Montgomery avenua and
Taylor street. In this instance Ihe
place was a complete wreck when the
thieves left. The last crime committed
was in the grocery and bar of Vaccar
ri & Sons at Greenwich and Mason. An
effort was first made to pry off the
lock, but being unsuccessful in this the
thieves smashed a panel in one of the
doors and entered.
The crimes were easily traced to four
vouths who live in the neighborhood
and the arrest of three of them fol
lowed.

LADIES TO GOLF
AT THE PRESIDIO
Last Competition of Present
Season for Council's Cup
Commences Tuesday Morning-
On Tuesday morning, beginning at
9:30, the qualifying round over eighteen
hole?, medal play, of a competition for
the Council's cup for women will be
held on the links of the San Francisco
Golf Club.
It is so set down on the schedule of
the ladies' annex, but it is more prob
able that the qualifying round will be
dispensed with and that the ladies will
proceed at once to the opening rou:id
of match play. In that case the sec
ond or semi-final round will take place
on Wednesday morning and. the final
rcund on Thursday morning. This 13
the third and last competition for the
ladies' trophy during the present sea
son. The winners of the two contests
already held were Mrs. E. S. Miller
and Miss Alice Hager.
It is an interesting thing to compare
the expense of goif two hundred years
ago in Scotland and at the present day
in the United States. The details arc
derived from the diary of Sir James
Foulis, who lived in the seventeenth
century. Balls cost about 10 cents
apiece, a wooden club could be bought
for 50 cents and the hire of a caddie
for one round of a 36-hole course was
8 cents. Of course money was scarcer
and went further in those days than
now. Nowadays the expense of golf
in England is said to be pretty much
what the player chooses to make it.
Once he has joined a club and has pro
cured his outfit the chief expenditure
is on golf balls and on traveling to and
from the links, items -which a careful
man may keep down to low figures, it
is said, however, that the English
golfer who belongs to half a dozen
clubs, travels about the country to take
part in various competitions and has a
nice â¢ taste in Haskells, must have a
fairly long purse. In tnis country a
man who did these things would have
to be a millionaire or something like
one.

them of great promise.
Six greyhounds from the kennel of
J. J. Lavin of St. Louis arrived here
Thursday. They include imported

fastest 4pg about St. Louis, and some
puppies by Tiburon-Colonial Girl which
will start in the Belle Brandon.

in the Intercollegiate Meet
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Feb. 5.â
The track men have already begun se
rious training for the contest with the
University of California in April and
from now on the sJricteM of training
rules will be observed by all candi
dates for the varsity team. The rainy
weather during the latter part of the
week has Interfered with work on both
the track and the diamond, but at this
early part of the season a few days
Of idleneEs will have no apparent ef
fect on the ultimate condition of the
teams.
Stanford's track team this year, judg
ing "from present indications, will not
be the strong aggregation which every
one expected it would be after the in
tercollegiate meet last year. Many of
the men who were expected to con
tinue at college have left and in other
ways the team has been so crippled
that Trainer "Dad" Moulton faces the
proposition of building up almost an
entire new team.
The three hurdlers- who were in. col
lege last year â Kuhn, Naramore and
Wellerâ have left, leaving both the
hurdles open events. Crawford', who
won first place in the hammer throw,
is not eligible because he is acting as
a paid assistant in the chemistry de
partment. With Weller out of college,
an entirely new bunch of men .will
have to be tried out for that event.
Thomson, who won the half mile with
ease last year, ha3 also left college.
Hawley. the crack sprinter, graduated
with the class of 1903, and Captain Mc-
Caughern will also be missed in the
sprints.^ "Pie" Smith, quarter-rmiler
and relay man, is another of the car
dinal's point winners who has been lost
by graduation. *
- The only men at present on the track
who have won their varsity emblems
are Captain Holman in the distances,
Dunn and Crossman in the 440-<yard
run, Dole and Beach in the pole vault,
Bell and Henley in the jumps and Hyde
in the shot put.
Unless the weather is much improved
to-morrow and the diamond in condi
tion to be played on the game between
the varsity nine and Clif Ireland's In
dependents will be canceled.
some clever coursers, including Rec
tor, Full Moon, Pasha PJeasant and

William C. Johnson, a clerk resid
ing in this city, filed a petition in in
solvency yesterday in the United
States District Court. JHe owes $958
and has no assets. . - â¢
The tenth renewal of the Burns
handicap will be decided this after
noon at Ingleside track. Never in the
history of this, the classic event of the
California turf, has such a high-class
field been carded to face the barrier.
In the past it has been won by Haw
thorne, Wheel of Fortune, Ruinart,
Satsuma, Fluer de Lis, Imperious, The
Fretter, Eonic and Horton, but it is
doubtful if any of these would have a
chance with the turf giants that will
battle for supremacy and the $10,000
purse to-day.
It is a prize well worth striving for
and present indications point to a field
of at least sixteen starters. The flower
of the entire country's riding talent,
with the possible exception of Grover
Cleveland Fuller, will wear silk. Big
bonuses have been offered the cracks
to secure their services, win or lose.
Bookmaker Cae3ar Young will at
tempt to repeat his coup of 1902 with
Eonic. The mare is in at 100 pounds
and Arthur Redfern, the premier
light-weight, has been brought here
from Los Angeles to ride her, receiv
ing $500, win or lose. Walter Jen
nings will have many a string to his
bow, for his popular red and white
stripes will be sported by three, the
mighty Proper, which will shoulder
the top impost of 127 as a. penalty for
his long string of victories and be
ridden by Jack Martin: Arcade and
the dainty Nigrette. There is also a
bare possibility that either Shot Gun,
the herculean mudlark, or the fash
ionable Dainty may replace one of
those named. The Jennings .stable
will, of course, rule favorite, for the
public has learned that it is a profit
able one to follow. ; : ' â  -
Next in point of prominence comes
M. J. Daly's war horse Claude, winner
of four derby's and secc nd to The Picket
for last year's American Dsrby, with
the heavy Impost of 129 pounds in the
saddle â â¢Claude will pick up 122 pounds
and have as pilot Johnny Daly, who at
present Is riding In splendid form. -
New York will be represented by
Oarsman, assigned 118 pounds, with
Otto Wonderly as his guiding mentor.
The Eastern horse has always shown to
better advantage on a fast track, and
it Is thought the heavy going to-day
will greatly militate against his
chances.: - Fossil, the gallant little
brown horse, with 114 pounds to nego
tiate, must' of course be conceded a
look-in, for* he. is always '.'knocking! at
the door." He will be, ridden . by "Bis
Bill" Knnpp.;
In every big race of this sort there is
always the so-termed "dangerous
horse." From all accounts the-onein
to-day's event the, owners of the top
weights are scared of is.FauIconbrldge.
Bob Smith's horse worked? the distance
in 2:06 3-5, is partial 1 to: heavy ;â  going
and'with the clever apprentice ;Harry.
Larsen in the saddle Is entitled to con
sideration.
â¢ Among the leEser lights Modicum'
cannot be entirely overlooked. ; He is a
horse with unsound;, underpinning and
looks outclassed. Still accidents, occur
and besides Dell Fountain*s\entry will
have : Hildebrand .up, and .that. count3
fora good ideal.. Over a sloppy % course
Modicum can dispose of : horses 'that
would lose him on "a dry track, arid,
therefore, may furnish the :. surprise.
Horton, winner of + this ; race last year,
will â¢ again be a : . starter, with his old
friend C. Kelly up. Owing to the. track
Our Bessie, is a doubtful ; starter,' as - are
Horatius, Divina ; and' Ben ; MacDhul.
SCOTCH BOWLERS
ARE PRACTICING
Hope to Be Able to Use the
New Park Green for Tourn
ament Play in Two Weeks
The announcement during the week
that the new green at Golden Gate
Park would be opened on the 22d inst.
was a welcome piece of news to the
Scottish bowlers. The green has been
closed for several weeks and a large
number of the club members have had
no opportunity to bowl. â  .
About fifteen or twenty enthusiasts
have bowled on the old green every
Saturday afternoon. It is expected
when tournament play is resumed on
the 22d there will be many surpises
in the first round.. Those who have
not been practicing will probably find
a falling off in their games. The few
who have been playing once a week
have been improving and the result
of their practice will be apparent in
the tournament.
The old green is a fair substitute,
but" is not nearly as good as the new
one, which is better sheltered and more
central. The former is a long way out
and the weather at this time of the
year is disagreeable. The men who
have kept in practice with the idea of
carrying off tournament honors are Y.
C. Lawson, T. G. Aiken. T. McNaught,
J. C. Mvffatt, M. L. \:rowe, W. H.
Stewart, Dr. Gunn, R. Park and J. T.
Dare. .
Several good players drew together
in the opening round and close matches
â¢will result. Aiken, has improved.prob
ably more than any other man. and
is expected to : get well along in
tournament. Y. C. Lawson, the win
ner of v the first tournament, is bowling
a. strong game.and many expect him
to win. His chief contenders will be
J. C. Moftatt, John McLaren and T.
McNaught. These players are all about
equally skillful and their chances . of
winning are. about even.
The members, of the San Francisco
Scottish Bowling Club will meet next
Thursday evening, at which time the
time limits for the different rounds will
be fixed. Another object of the meet
ing is to, hold the drawings for the
first doubles tournament. About thirty
of the best players have entered.

WOMEN TO MEET
IN CUP MATCHES
Fifth of a Series of Con
tests v the Jackman Tro-
pliy Will Be Held To-Day
The only tennis tournament sched
uled for this week is a handicap singles
for women, to be played on the Golden
Gate Park courts to-day. Play will
commence at 9:30 o'clock, and it is ex
pected .the finals will be reached at
about 2:30. All of those who played in
the last tournament of this kind have
entered, and it is expected several oth
ers will compete.
The event is the fifth of a series for
the Jackman cup. This trophy was of
fered almost a year ago. but has only
been competed for four times. The
ladles are showing more interest in
the game than ever, and in future a
tournament will be held every two
weeks until the cup is disposed of.
The four winners have been the most
heavily handicapped in the past. Miss
Miriam Edwards, Miss Hazel Hotch
kiss and Miss Ethel Ratcliffe, all of
Berkeley and all playing from * 4 15"
back of scratch, ,have their names in
scribed on the cup. The fact that the
cup has not been won by a handicap
player nor one from this city Is sig
nificant of two things. One is the handi
caps allowed have not been sufficiently
liberal, and the other is that expert
lady players in this city are csarce.
There are probably five lady players
here to one in Berkeley, yet the college
town has four fair racket wlelders who
outclass anybody on" this side of the
bay.
The handicaps in the last tournament
â¢were larger than usual, but the result
was the same. Two of the scratch
players met in the finals. Some of the
better players will undoubtedly be sur
prised when they read the handicaps.
Large odds will be > given to all those
' playing above scratch, and the latter
will not have an easy time winning. It
is the intention of the committee in
charge, to get the name of at least one
lower class player on the cup before it
goes acros the bay.
Mis3 Ethel Ratcliffe leads in the race
for the cup and needs but one more
victory to become its permanent own
er. Miss Miriam Edwards and Mis3
Hazel Hotchkiss have their names on
the cup once. Miss Edwards did not
play in the last tournament, but is en
tered in this. She is somewhat out of
practice, but has a good chance of win
ning from either Miss Hotchkiss or
Miss Ratcliffe should they meet. The3e
three players will be "Id 3-6" behind
scratch to-day, while the others who
figured in the last tourney will be given
the same odds. Miss Wegener and Mrs.
Watson are entered, and, with Miss
Bessie Valleau and Miss Maud Varhey,
will play from the "15" mark. ;
The return match between Herbert
Schmidt of the California Club and
Clarence Griffin of the Golden Gate
Club will be played on the park courts
to-morrow afternoon.
No arrangements have been made for
a return match between the clubs, but
one will probably be hald In a few
weeks. The California Club will be
strengthened in the next meeting and
should carry off the honors.
The Golden Gate Club will hold a
class singles on the 14th and 21st. Two
classes will be played on each of these
dates.
The drawing for the ladies' handicap
is as follows:
Preliminary roundâ Miss Alice 'Duncan CU)>
vs.- Miss Anita BeyfU3s (15): Miss Hotchkiss
(owe 153-ti)-vÂ«. Miss V. Crocker (30): Miss B.

Frank Stone, one for J. R. Hanlfy and
the other for M. A. Newell. Both
schooners are of modern type, the one
for M. A. Newell having a foot more
beam and longer overhangs than that

commodious cabins, with plenty of
headroom, and will be provided with
every convenience for cr\iising.
Frank Stone's sloop Presto will have
her overhangs extended, her sides built
up and her cabin raised, so as to render
her a roomier and more comfortable
craft. She will have no bowsprit, her

Koster was all in during the pro

In the third round Koster took a

Moreno was not in the best of form

he would rush Koster when the chance
looked good. The fourth round was
in Moreno's favor and the judges gave
him the decision without a murmur.

LOS AXGELES, Feb. 5.â The races
at Ascot Park were run over a muddy
track to-day for the first th*.e since the
season began and form players were at
some disadvantage in picking winners.
They were fairly successful, however,
three favorites, two second choices and
an outsider capturing the purses.
Schreiber's Pinkerton won the two
year-old event at. half a mile, which
was second on the card, in the easiest
kind of fashion. "Wotxlclairn was sec

ton was 1 to 2 in the bettins.
The first race brought out a large
field of ordinary horses. Silver Fir, at
4 to 1, winning from Capable and Chem
ist.
Trre third race went to Double O,
which was practically overlooked in the
betting. Twenty to one was his price,
and he defeated the favorite, J. V. Kir
by, in handy style. Miss Nettie waÂ»
third.
Sais won the fourth from Dargin and
Gloriosa. He was heavily played.
The fifth was an upset. Buccleuth
was a red-hot favorite, but failed to
show. Red Damsel, at 6 to 1, won all
the way. Canejo was a close second
and Galanthus third.
The sixth number fell to the favor

THE SAN FRANCISCO CALL, SATURDAY. FEBRUARY 6. 1904.
PRINCESS TITANIA IS FIRST,
RIDDEN BY ARTHUR REDFERN
First Choices Do
Not Take to
the Mud.
The crack lightweight Jockey Arthur
Redfern came up expressly to ride
Eonic in the big stake to-day, but Red
fern Sr. was prevailed upon to allow
his son to -ride Princess Titania in the
six and a half furlong handicap at In
gleside yesterday and the young man
came out of it with all the honors.
Hildebrand. who rode John A. Scott,
boasted of what he would show the
Eastern boy, but fell as flat as a toad
on a rock of doing so. The track was
in a sloppy condition and the price
about the Princess went from 3 to 21
to 5. Kenilworth was asked to carry
122 pounds, but In spite of this/went to
the post a " to 5 chance. "Willie See
may he able to ride some horses, but
he handles Kenilworth with about as
much skill as a truckman would an
automobile.
It was a two-horse race from the
start. Hildebrand went away in the
lead with John A. Scott, but Redfern
oh the Princess never permitted him
to get far away. In the stretch when
Scott began tiring Princess Titania
forged ahead, winning by four open
lengths. Kenilworth got away third
and never bettered his position. O'Ha
gen was the only other starter.
OXE FAVORITE IiAXDS.
Favorites met with poor success, Did
erot being the only one to pick up a
purse. The weather was clear and
pleasant and there was a large crowd
present.
Mike Daly turned a warm one loose
in the opening event. He sent Sir Tom
Tiddler to the post after a long vaca
tion and backed from 20 down to 8 the
big Loyalist horse went out and
spreadeagled his field. Adirondack
finished second, h^lf a length ahead of
Boutonniere. Flyer, the 4 to 5 favorite,
ran third.
Marie J was the next favorite to fall
by the wayside. The fllly ruled a 3 to 2
favorite for the 2-year-old scramble^.nd
was easily defeated by Wllla, the sec
ond choice, ' ridden by Hildebrand.
Edith Vice took show honors from Del
Carina.
Larsen rode a well judged race on
Decoy, a 6 to 1 chance, receiving a nose
decision over Expedient at the finish
of the mile and a sixteenth selling af
fair. Expedient, an 18 to 5 favorite,
was slow to begin as usual, falling
a trifle short at the wire, although no
fault could be found with' Jack Mar
tin's ride. Xorford finished third, rid
den by Gruwell, an apprentice. With
an experienced rider in the saddle, the
big gelding would have won by himself.
ALBEMARLE A WIN'XER.
Ulctma, the "Seattle Interurban,'
came dangerously close to winning the
five- furlong sprint, for which Muresca
had first call in the betting. The little
mare made all the running and at the
end was only led out a neck by Albe
marle, the second choice, astride which
Hildebrand rode a strong finish. Oli
phant rode a weak race on Muresca,
losing the show to Matt Hogan/
Sloppy going was always the long
suit of Diderot, and Jack Atkin's geld
ing downed Ulilouon a nose for the con
cluding race of the day. There was
such a steady play on The Fretter that
he closed e(jual choice with Diderot.
For half a mile The Fretter stayed
with Diderot, then began falling back
and ran unplaced. Ulilouon closed
strongly and at the finish Oliphant on
Diderot was brought to a hard drive to
win by a nose. Mr. Dingle finished
third.
NOTES OF THE TRACK.
Hildebrand rode two winners, was
once second and twice finished third.
Trains will leave Third and Townsend
streets for Ingleside to-day at 1 and
1:15 p. m.

YACHTS WILL SAIL
OX SPRECKELS LAKE
XeÂ« Sheet of Water Will Be Avail
able for Washington's Birth
day Races.
The model yachtsmen are anxiously
awaiting the formal opening of
Spreckels Lake in Golden Gate Park.
There is at present about two feet of
water in the lake and it is expected
the necessary four feet will be in by
the 22d inst. Arrangements are un
der way for the first big race meet to
be held on that date.
Many of the small craft have been
skimming Stow Lake during the past
two weeks, but the sport will be much
better when the new lake is ready for
use. There is much more wind there
than at Stow Lake and the facilities
for sailing generally are much bet
ter. The banks of the old lake are
not as good for landing as those of
the new and the yachtsmen will have
less trouble from this source.
The time allowance this year will
be seven seconds to the inch. With
the new measuring machine it will be
possible to get the exact measure
ments, and this, with the amount of
canvas carried, will determine the
allowance. This will work rather a
hardship on some of those who have
already built large boats. B. Jurgen's
Zarapa is one of the largest boats, 75
inches, and will have to allow many
inches to the shorter boats.
Nearly all the craft . this year are
sloop rigged. Commodore Gunning
has a seventy-two-inch model rigged
this way and she has proved fast in
trial heats.
William Brown, the pioneer model
yacht owner of San Francisco, has a
new miniature yacht called the D.
Cerelli. It is a sixty-nine-inch model
and is fast-
Vice Commodore Henry London is
still sailing the Imp. This boat car
ried off many prizes last year and the
owner expects it to do the same this
year. L. E. Gaudy and Commodojre
Gunning are sailing the sister boats.
Lulu and Witch, every Sunday, t They
have been altered since their last ap
pearance and it would be hard to say
which is the faster.
Many of the yachtsmen will be out
to-morrow sailing their boats on the
new lake. There will be some im
promptu races and the owners will be
able to get a line on the different
boats.

A. W. Pape, the well-known mem

the Olympic Athletic Club, who has
been the amateur champion single
sculler of the Pacific Coast for several
years, will probably take part in no

is a member of the Portland Rowing
Club", a letter in which he stated that
he intends to retire from racing.
By the retirement of A. W. Pape,
the Portlander becomes the champion
amateur single-sculler of the Pacific
Coast. He has stated that he Is ready
to defend the title against all comers,
as he does not wish to hold his title of
champion merely .by default. He is
practicing regularly with a view to be
ing in condition to meet any scullers
who may challenge him. He is desir
ous to pull against Fred Ay era of the
Alamefla Boat Club or any oarsman
of Puget Sound. He hopes that Fred
Ayers of Alameda and De Brlssey of
British Columbia will visit Portland
during the coming summer at the time
of the annual regatta of the North
Pacific Association. : ;";â¢ /
There is a good prospect that row
ing will be taken up vigorously at Val

Kaarsberg, formerly a well 'known
baseball and football player of the
University of California, is an electri
cal engineer in the Government yards
at Mare Island and an active member
of the Vallejo Yachting and Boating
Club. He has written to the Boating
Association of the University of Cali
fornia to arrange for a race between
crews representing Vallejo and the
university. Two < paper shells are be
ing built for the Vallejo Boat Club and
it is intended to train the crews care
fully.
The class fours of the university are
practicing regularly at Oakland
Creek, except the freshman crew,
which is working on the rowing ma
chines in the gymnasium. The direc
tor of physical culture of the univer
sity intends to purchase four addi
tional r6wing machines, with which
an eight-oar combination can be
made. Besides the class fours, the
university and the second crews will
be prepared for the race against a
crew representing the University of
Washington that will be held on San

Wearers of Scotch Thistle
Association footballers will appear
on three fields to-morrow to struggle
for the championship of the California
League. On the Presidio athletic
grounds the unbeaten Thistle eleven
will play against the Pickwicks, Henry
Roberts being the- referee. The ball
will be kicked off at 11 a. m. As the
Thistles have never lost a match dur
ing the season, while the Pickwicks
have proved victorious in only one
game, the result hardly admits of any
doubt. The teams will line up in the
following positions:
Thistles. Positions. Pickwick.".

On the cricket grounds at Webster
street, Alameda, the Albion Rovers
will play the Occidental team, the ball
being kicked off at 2:30 p. m.. and
CC W. Irish being the referee. The
teams will be as follows:
Albion Rovers. Positions. Occidentals.

At Idora Park, Oakland, the Vam
pire eleven will play the Oakland
Hornets, the ball being kicked off at
2:30 p. m.,' and Arthur Robinson be
ing the referee. Peterson, the captain
of the Vampire team, has removed
from San Francisco, but will be on
hand to take charge of the eleven.
The teams will line up in the follow
ing order:
Oakland Hornets. Positions. Vampires.
C.C. Y.Willlamson Goalkeeper Alrth

The Vampires stand at the head of
the California Association Football
League, but as they lead the Thistles
by only one point and have played
two more matches than the Scotch
team, there is little doubt that the
Thistles will gain the top place when
they have played all their matches.
The Thistles and Vampires will almost
certainly win their games to-morrow,
so that the relative positions of the
two teams will remain unchanged.
The- Independents draw the bye to
morrow and so have no chance of in
creasing their score. The positions of
the teams are shown in the following
table:

The champion Presidio ball team

RIVAL BOXERS
EACH SEEK THE
STAGE CENTER
Young Corbett and Britt
Strive to Be in the Ef
fulgent Glow of the Calcium
EASTERNER IN THE LEAD
With Stacks of Gold Wrested
From Bookmakers He Plays
Part of Prince Fortunatiii
While Young Corbett and Jimmy
Britfare no longer prospective ring op
ponents, the rivalry between these
Beau Brummels of the ring shows no
signs of abating. - It crops out in odd
ways and places and is keeping the
sporting men agape to see what turn
it may take.
Young Corbett seems to be showing
the way. He is" rolling in wealth again,
wealth won # in six-round bout3 with tha
bookmakers, and from long practice
the role of Prince Fortunatus comes
naturally to him. He had his first
chance to outshine Jimmy on Thurs
day.
A subscription list Is being passed
around for Joe Mone. an invalid well
known about the sporting resorts. In
due time the list reached the Cali
fornian and he promptly put his name
down for ?20.
The bearer of the list, knowing
human nature, lost no time in hunting
up "Sjoung Corbett- The champion
glanced over the list carelessly, but
when his gaze fell on the Spencerian
signature of Britt, it took him but an
instant to affix his signature, that sig
nature which looks so good when it
appears at the bottom of a set of ar
ticles for a flght. The amount set op
posite the name was $23 and the cham
pion said something about "That'll
hold him for a time."
Britt was about town yesterday of
fering a premium for a box at a
local theater for Monday night. It
seems Corbett outgeneraled him here
again, as the latter has one of the
stage boxes engaged and will be on
hand with a party of guests to wel
come his frienda from Broadway. If
any one from the queen of beauty to
the humblest chorus girl, if there are
any humble ones, does not know Wil
lie, it is not his fault.
Corbett is credit-d with: having ad
ded JCOOO to his bankroll at the track
yesterday. As he has money in plenty,
an automobile and a prizefight on his
hands, Britt is unable to see how he
can take the center of the stage from
the little gladiator, but he intends to
keep on trying even if he gets a fight
on his hands.
SALVADOREAN BONDS
READY FOR DELIVERY
Attorney FP*?enbamn Corrects an
Error Regarding Consul E. Mejia
and Others.
"SAN FRANCISCO, Cal.. Feb. 3. 1304.
"Editor San Francisco Callâ Dear Sir:
In yesterday's issue of your paper a
special dispatch from Washington ap
pears, under date of February 3. in
which a statement is made in refer
ence to the fact that Colonel John P.
Irish has found it necessary to enlist
the aid and support of the Government
of the United States in behalf of cer
tain of his clients against the 'recal
citrant Salvadorean Government.' The
case referred to 13 known as the El
Triunfo award against Salvador.
"A further statement is made that
the Government of Salvador has failed
to live up to its agreement in this mat
ter.
"On behalf of the Government of Sal
vador and of his Excellency E." Mejia,
Consul General for that Government
in thi3 city, I desire to request you' to
kindly correct the statements made in
the article referred to.
"According to the terms of the com
promise between Colonel Irish's clients
and the Government of Salvador, the
bonds were to. have been delivered to
the Union National Bank of Oakland
on behalf of the various claimants
against the Government.
"These bonds have been In the pos
session of Mr. Mejia and of the con
sulate since the 11th day of January.
1904, on which day Mr. Mejia wrote to
the Union National Bank, requesting
that a representative of the bank call
at the consulate to receive and receipt
for the bonds.
"This they have failed to do, and we
still hold these bonds ready to deliver
them whenever the legal representa
tive of the bank is prepared to- give a
proper receipt for them.
"A statement is also made in this
article that the claim and award
against Salvador 'grew out of the rob
bing of certain American citizens in
that country some years ago.'
"I respectfully refer you to the 'Re
port of the Salvadorean Arbitrator, Dr.
Pacas. to the Secretary of Foreign Re
lations of the Republic of El Salvador.*
which report has been filed with tha
State Department at Washington and
a copy of which is at the disposal ot
your paper should you desire^ to in
vestigate further and correct and rec
tify the false impression that must nec
essarily have been created by this
statement.
"Thanking you In advance for giving
this letter as much prominence as you
have given to the special dispatch here
in referred to. I remain yours very
truly, SANFORD FEIGENBAUM,
"Attorney for the Government of Sal
vador and for his Excellency E.
Mejla. its Consul General at Saa

FINIGAN SUES

Tnrns Lawyer and Brings Ac
tion Against the Men He
Employed to Defend Him
SEEKS TO RECOVER LAND
Claims Defendants Refuse to
Return Berkeley Property
Pledged to Secure Bill
Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, Feb. 5.
Acting as his own attorney. Colonel
P. A. Finigan to-day bÂ»Â»gan a suit
against James P. Sweeney and George
N. Williams, the attorneys that he em
ployed several years ago to defend him
in a divorce action instituted against
him by his second wife. Finigan al
leges that he and his daughters deed
ed the attorneys a piece of property
at Dwfjjht way and Ellsworth street
in Berkeley to secure them their fee
of J300. which he was then unable to
pay. and that they have since refused
to turn over the property to him.
Finigan's troubles have been many.
He is not an attorney, but his connec
tion with suits within the last few
years has given him the knowledge
necessary to draw up a complaint. 'His
second wife in 1S9S secured a divorce
from him after having spent, accord
ing to Finigan. over $100,000 of his
money, and he became famous when
he served a term of imprisonment in
the San Rafael jail for refusing to pay
the alimony awarded by Judge Angel
lotii.
He has been in the courts ever since.
The piece of property at present in
litigation is said to be worth about
520.000.

THE. SAN FRANCISCO CALL. SATURDAY, FEBRUARY 6. 1904.
OVERDUE SHIP ST. MIRREN
REACHES PORT IN SAFETY
Coal-Laden Britisher "Which 'Was Reinsured for Thirty
Per Cent and Whose Non-Appearance Was Occasion
for Grave 'Anxiety Arrives From Australian Port
THE AMERICAN* BRIG GALILEE. WHICH RECENTLY MADE THE RUN TO WASHINGTON ISLAND IN
STEAMSHIP TIME AND BROKE ALL THE: RECORDS FOR THE 3000-MILE VOYAGE, MAKING THE
PASSAGE IN FIFTEEN DAYS.
Those interested in the British ship
St. Mirren were surprised and delighted
yesterday afternoon when the overdue
Britisher bobbed up over the horizon.
She was ten miles out at Â§ o'clock and
reached port too late to pass quaran
tine. The St. Mirren left Newcastle,
Australia, 117 days ago with a cargo
of particularly dangerous coal. It was
the same kind of coal that caused the
destruction of the British ships Frank
istan and Fannie Kerr. It has a repu
tation for peculiar susceptibility to
spontaneous combustion. Always dan
gerous, its inflammable tendencies in
crease with the length of its stay in
the ship's hold. It has burst into
flames within forty-five days of being
placed aboard ship.
When the St. Mirren had been out
nearly 100 days the anxiety of those in
terested in her increased, and although
reinsured at only 30 per cent her
chances of safety were considered very
Elim. ; â¢ '
She har. arrived, however, and Cap
tain Skimmon's report of the passage is
awaited with interest by the marine
underwriters. There was considerable
speculation on the St. Mirren, a large
sum being invested "not to arrive."
Those that bought at 10 per cent and
sold out when the rate reached 30 per
cent more than doubled their money,
but the many who held on in the hope
of a further advance saw their invest
ment disappear with the appearance in
apparently good condition of the St.
Mirren.
The Galilee's Record Run.
Nearly 3000 miles as the crow files is the dis
tance from this port to Washington Island.
*As a sallies vessel would go. the distance is
much ereater. accord inir* to how far tfft the
straight course the varying direction of the
wind compelled the vessel to tack. Tho bn<
Galilee has Just made the run from here to
Washington Island In fifteen days. Had she
sailed a straight courFe her averase dally run
would have been nearly 200 miles. She prob
ably did much better, although fair winds
must have been the rule. This is the record
for this trip, and is better time than many
steamers could have made. The Galilee Is a
vessel of 32!t tons register. She. wan built
thirteen years aro at Benlcla by Matthew
Turner, and is one of the very few brigs on
this coast.
American Ship Holds Record.
Now come the friends of the famous old ship
Glory of the Fcas and takn strenuous objection
to thÂ« fierir.an ship Optima's being credited
with havlns broken the record of the passage
from hfre to Newcastle. Australia. The Optima
recently made the trip In thirty-seven dayÂ».
The Glory- of tho Seas, it now appears, made
the run in 1S71 In thirty-five days. The
American shiiÂ» Hv/allov.-, the American bark
Elwood Cooper and the British ship Alahabad
each madf> the run In thirty-nine days. Tho
pace set In Ib71 by the Glory of the Seas has.
never, been Â«qua!cd. Tho German ahlp
Optima holds second place.
Minute, Guns Boom.
Minute guns were fired yesterday from the
heights of Yerba Ilucna'by gunners from the

the Navy.
British Sealer's Catch.
The schooner B<Â»rtle Miner, which arrived
yesterdayvat San Pedro, from â¢ Eureka, reports
having spoken the British sealing schooler
Caeco on January 31. The. sealer reported
havinr 20 skins.
Water Front . Xotes.
The steamer Argyll, Captain Gllboy, arrived
yesterday, nine days and five hours from
Kahulul. She came up In ballast.
The Italian cruiser , Puglla yesterday com-
menced taking coal, in preparation for her

FIGHTS WOLVES
IN THE WATER
British Columbian Attempts
to Cross a Lake and Is
Attacked by Savage Beasts
HOUNDS IN THE BATTLE
Vigorous Use of an Ax Saves
the Life of a Miner of
the Turtle River Region
VANCOUVER, B. C, Feb. 5.âAlex
ander Morrissey, a miner of Turtle
River, near Dauphin, had a thrilling
experience with a pack of wolves while
crossing: Round Lake, an arm of Lake
Manitoba. . "While a considerable dis
tance from shore he was surrounded
and attacked by twelve or fifteen fero
cious animals, and he says he posses
ses no language capable of describing
the battle.
At the time Morrissey had with him
two hounds and an ax, and had it
not been for these, he says, there is no
doubt at all that he would have been
torn to pieces by the wolves. The
hounds fought hard, and one of them
was killed in the encounter.
Morrissey claims to have done great
execution with his ax, and more than
one wolf died, while others were badly
wounded.

Nezv York Cotton Market.
NEW YORK, Feb. 5.â The cotton market
opened steady at a decline of 10 points to an
advance of 7 points, with the market develop- |
ing greater firmness as the call progressed
The opening declines were due to continued
liquidation and bear pressure, while the steadier
tone was on less unfavorable war news than
expected, the rally In the Liverpool market,
where price, after opening 30 points lower, had
rallied to about the anticipated figures. It also
developed that there was a good, deal of bull
support. Mr. Sully was buying, brokers repre
senting New Orleans were buying, and for the
first twenty-five minutes the market raled very
firm, selling up to a net gain of from 31 to 34
points on the active months. But outside longs
were still panicky and toward the end of the
first half hour a. well directed bear attack
broke prices a few points, outside liquidation
became overwhelmingly active and the market
In an instant was plunged into wild excite
ment. Inside of an hour 1 ' prices had been
driven down until March was selling af 13.75c
May at 13.99c ffnd July at 14.10c, a net de
cline of 110Q121 points on these positions, July
on last Monday having sold at 17.55c. The low
point of the morning therefore indicate a loss
of about $700 on every hundred bales of cotton
Offerings diminished, toe local bull leader be
gan buying. New Orleans continued to support
the market. Â«<hortB turned to cover and the act.
ive months were rallied 70 to 75 points.' Fol
lowing thesfe fluctuations were narrow and com
paratively Irregular. Just before the close the
local bull leader became a heavy buver, bid
ding July up to 14.92c. but this demand filled
the market closed barely steady, with July at
14.82c. The new months were from 5 points
higher to 10 points lower. Sales were esti

Future Grain and Provisions.
CHICAGO, Feb. 5.â Exceptional' activity was
displayed in the wheat pit at the opening to
day. Prices were extremely erratic and showed
wide fluctuations. Owing to the acuteness of
the war situation shorts appeared determined
to even up trades with little regard to prices.
In this effort the price of May was J forced
,4c above the high record mark registered yes
terday, the opening quotation being %<8Â¥ic
lower to '.i@%c higher at $>5@i)6e. July was
a shade to Vjfr^c lower at 854@35%c. . Within
ten minutes from the time May had touched
96c the price had' fallen to 93Â»ic, a' drop of
24c, while July had sold j off to 84 Vic,' or
1Â»4(. below the top figure. After the first
minute or two of trading there wag a' flood
of long wheat poured on . the market and it
seemed as though everybody.. had' wheat for
sale. Under this heavy pressure prices began
to decline. Stop-loss orders came out and
Increased the downward tendency, and for
a time the situation looked extremely
critical.- ' The leader of 'â â¢ the bull crowd,'
however. suDorted the . market ; on the
break, and a fair rally occurred. From 934c
May nulckiy advanced to imie, while July
steadied around M=hc. ' Trading then devel
oped into a rather tame affair, but the market
was nervous. Outside of the signs of impend
ing war, the early news contained several
Items of exceedingly bearish import. Receipts
In the Northwest and Southwest were' heavier
than last year. Weather conditions on the Pa
cific Coast and the Southwest were materially
improved. Argentina reported much more lib
eral shipments thun a year ago. These factors
werÂ» influential In bringing out a lot of July
wheat, and. Incidentally, had a depressing ef
fect on the May ootion. "Fresh war rumors
were circulated in the pit late In the day, re
sulting in another active â¢ buying: movement,
the biK bull operator being reported on that
side of the market. The demand became so
urgent the last few minutes that the early
loss wa.s all recalned. Just before the close
July sold uo to 86V6C. and final figures were
at S3 7 4Â®SÂ«I, a net itain for the day of 54 C^
May closed at 95c, a less of 3h@4c.
Aside from the heavy liquidation early in
the day, the most conspicuous feature in the
com market was the relative strength of the
July delivery. Heavy selling of May by some
of the prominent holders caused a severe
break early In Â«ne session. The opening on
May was unchanged to 4c lower, at 554Â®56c.
Prices immediately started downward, and be
fore any support materialized May had sold
off to 54Â»ic. Late* in the day the market be
came exceedingly strong, and prices advanced
above the opening level. May closed %c
higher, at Sfj'fcc, after selling at 56Uc. July
ranged between Sl'Kc and 53fs<\ closlnjr with
a gain of l%eivÂ»c, at 53%c.
Oats folJowed the course of other grains.
The close was at thÂ« top and on a level with
yesterday's close. Local receints were 98 cars.
Trading in provisions was active, but a
a weaker tone prevailed. The decline In the
grain pits and lower prices for hogs had a
depressing influence early In the day, and the
market was unable to retain losses sustained
under liberal liquidation at that time. The
close was steady at a small decline, May pork
being off 124c at $13 60. May lard was
down 74<\ at $7 55, while ribs were 5c lower,
at $6 774.

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
Trade in Potatoes was quiet pending the ar
rival of the Oregon xteamer. which was hourly
expected with an unusually large cargo. All
1 descriptions, however, were firmly held, as the
market was under speculative control and price*
of river Burbanks were advanced. Sweets were
Inclined to drag, although offered at a decline.
No fresh stock came In. Only 23 sacks of
Onions were received and prices were well
maintained, as available supplies were held by
two houses. .
Offerings of Tomatoes and Summer Squash
from Los Angeles were liberal and prices were
lower, but receipts of ether vegetables from
the sams section continued light, and as the
demand was steady prices were well main
tained. Choice offerings of new Potatoes from
across the bay were in fair request at 3fj ic per
pound, while small and poor offerinss could
not be sold even below the minimum quotation.
There was no fresh Rhubarb, received and car
ried-over stock dragged at previous prices. The
Rhubarb growers of Alameda County have ap
pointed a committee to perfect organization
and the association will hold Its Initial meeting
early next week.

Poultry and Game.
Trade in live Poultry was rather quiet, but
prices of all descriptions were unchanged, as
the market was but slenderly supplied with
domestic stock, and the two cars of Western
that came in on the preceding day were about
cleaned up. All dealers - were anticipating: an
active market for next week, when Poultry
will be in demand among the Chinese for their
New Year festivities. About 50 cases of dressed
Turkeys came in and good stock met with a
steady demand at lSt^lc per pound, while poor
lots dragged at 10ft 17c.
Game was in light -receipt, and, although the
stock was poor and thin, everything cleaned
up well. Ducks especially being in demand.
Sprig and Teal were quoted higher. *

Butter, Cheese and Eggs.
Butter was again quoted weak, with dealers
offering creamery firsts freely at 2SÂ©2Â»Vjc and
some extras were also reported offered at 2S 1 ic.
The tendency Is now downward, while stocks
are larger than they have been and the de
mand is light. Buyers are holding off.
There is no change In Cheese, supplies being
as large as ever and the demand slack.
The regular annual increase in Egg receipts
seems to have set in, and those for the past
; several days have averaged over 1000 cases per
> day. The market is no lower, but the feeling
is rerx>rted less firm, while the demand, which
I has hitherto been eager, is now decidedly slow.
The price tendency is downward.

Owing to the cloudy and threatening weath

mand for the large sizes of Navels there was
practically nothing doing In Oranges and the
auction which was announced for 'yesterday

A PECULIAR DISCOVERY
Him of William II. IJapge Find* EIoc

Part of Infernal Machine.
The son of William H. Bagge. a
contractor of 31 S Bush Ftreet, found
an electrical appliance, known as a
condenser, in a vacant lot on Sacra
mento strict, 'between L:Â»urel and Lo
cust. Bagge had a contract for ex
cavating the lot for the building of
a barn. His boy was playing In the
sand with another youth and un
earthed the peculiar package.
At the time it was thought that the
condenser might have been made to
use as a portion of an infernal ma
ihine. but the absence of any explo
sives in the lot. which was thoroughly
dug up, caused the abandonment of
this theory. The condenser was com
posed of a long roll of pav affine-dipped
paper surrounding a sheet of tinfoil
equally long, with a copper wire con
nection at each end. The whole thing
was encased in a non-conducting coat
of paraffine and enclosed in a sealed
tin box. The apparatus could have
been used to explode a bomb. TJie
police have the matter in hand and
are s'earching for the owner.

Favorite
ACCUSED OF EMBEZZLING
PROMINENT FIRM'S MONEY
Edwin E. Stoddard, Trusted Employe of Dunham,
Carrigan & Hayden Company, Charged With
Utilizing Coin of Firm in Fast and Riotous Living
High living has brought ruin to an
other well-known good fellow along
the line. Edwin E. Stoddard. formerly
manager of the bicycle department of
Dunham, Carrigan & Com
pany, now stands before the world an
accused embezzler. Yesterday after
noon he was locked up in the City
Prison, charged with stealing $150
from his employers, though the real
amount of his peculations is said to
be at least $4000 and possibly a great
deal mure.
It is the same old story of a trusted
employe and a lenient employer. Ac
cording to the rumors tjjat' are fast
flitting about town, Stoddard has been
systematically robbing the firm by
which he was. employed for the â¢ last
four years. It trusted him as far as
it could and when the proof of his
guilt was at last a certainty his em
ployers decided to prosecute him.
Last January. Stoddard was abrupt
ly discharged from his position and at
that time it began to be noised around
town that his accounts were not as
straight as they might be. Nothing
was said at the time, however, and
Stoddard went East to make arrange
ments for opening an automobile
agency in this city.
He returned a few weeks ago and
wus preparing to launch himself into
the new field when he was arrested
on a warrant sworn to by Andrew
Carrigan. vice- president of the Dun
ham, Carrigan & Hayden Company,
charging him with embezzling $150 of
the firm's money on July 12, 1903. .
STOPDARD IS ARRESTED. .
Stoddard was arrested and locked
up in the City Prison ip .default of
$5000 bonds or $2000 cash bail. . He
refused !to discuss the matter and re
tained Tiis composure till late in the
afternoon, when he expected he would
be bailed out. When the hours passed
by and.Â»no kindly friend came to his
rescue Stoddard became visibly wor
ried and h-is nervousness increased.
The downfall of Stoddard is -attri
buted to a rapid existence along "the
line." He was' ever known as a good
fellow, who was willing and ready to
spend his money when the opportunity
presented itself. He always dined at
the high-class restaurants and -it was
his wont to^have only the real sporty
element sealed at his table. ....
As long as Stoddard had money to
spend and time 'in which to spend it
his friends never, murmured and, life
was one long spell of -pleasure. But
finally, after he lost his position and
funds were not forthcoming as rapid
ly as of yore, tho friends of his former
days grew, indifferent.
He secured an automobile agency
in this city and was all'ready to start
in on his: new 'line of businesswhen
the crash came. It is said that Mr.
Carrigan called Stoddard into his of
fice yesterday and taxed him with be
ing short in . his accounts. Stoddard,
it is said, admitted his guilt :iud",told
his employer that he. had systemati
cally robbed the. firm for the last. two
years, making away .with -,"$4000 . or
more. ' ,'â â¢â¢'â 
CARRIGAN'S STATEMENT.
It is not yet known just ;how .much
Stoddard stole from the firm. 'Andrew
Carrigan, who swore to the complaint,'
said: '- "'V- . > 'â â¢".. :
"It is true that we . have - to-day,
sworn out a warrant calling i for' the
arrest of .15. El Stoddard on a charge
of felony embezzlement, the amount
involved being $150. There is prac
tically nothing further- beyond this
mere statement other than to say that
Mr. Stoddard, acting as an agent of
the nham, Carrigan & Hayden
Company, collected this amount of
money and failed to make' any returns
for the same. Mr. Stoddard, having oc
cupied a- position of some responsi
bility with us, we considered' the; mat
ter sufficiently serious to warrant, us
in taking this action,- which ; we \ were
in duty bound to do." . '

Committee of the Merchants'

the Amendments Submitted
The grain committee of the Mer

cussing proposed changes in the grain
rules, made a preliminary report yes
terday morning., The"*, nmlttee favors
many of the changes suggested,- but
submitted a new resolution . altering
many. The plan was discussed at
length yesterday morning, and though
the majority of the speakers ' believed
that such alterations wouK broaden
the opportunities for grain trade at this
port, there were differences regarding
minor particulars and the matter went
over until next week. . ..
It is held by many that the grain
rules are loo stringent and. that the
business of .San Francisco has been
hampered thereby.
Northern ports are reaching out for
this profitable trade and members of
the exchange deemed it advisable, to
make such alterations in the rules as
would -ive. greater freedom to local
people. A set of amendments was .ac
cordingly prepared and submitted to
the committee. These amendments, if
adopted, "will be made applicable to de

-"Who Wrecked Their Firm
CREDITORS ARE SUSPICIOUS
Men for Whom: Credit Was Ex
tended Said to Have No
Standing- in Financial World
All kinds of rumors filled the air yes
terday concerning the failure of Bolton,
de Ruyter & Co.. the firm of brokers
that has "been forced to* the wall un
able to meet its obligations.
A peculiar state of affairs surrounds
the suspension of the brokerage firm,
and some of the creditors do not hes
itate to say that the members of the
firm may be called upon to explain
before the criminal courts the nature
of their business dealings.
Bolton and; de Ruyter preserved a
calm attitude yesterday. They pro
fessed that the public was not interest
ed in their failure and that they could
not give any information as to any of
their clients or their dealings.
The two members of the firm were
asked to give some explanation as to
the alleged dealings of Richard Genung,
their manager, which are supposed to,
have caused a loss to the firm resulting
in insolvency. Mr. de Iluyter said:
We Jo not thln'ic that Gpnun? Plas been
suilty of any action that would hold Jilm in
law. He simnly used the credit of the firm
to do businers on behalf of certain people.
ThoÂ«<Â» people *;ere not able to meet the ob
ligations and the loss fell upon us. It may
be called a breach of faith or bad judgment
on the part of Genune to usp our money to
speculate for some of our customers. Our
bookkeeper. Daniel O'Conncll, was copnisant
of what was Eoins on and we think that he
ought to have notlflpd us of â¢ thp state of
affairs. We admit that we have not exercised
that business acumen that we should have
done. Our business is a peculiar on- and
money is won or lost rapidly. Ye?, perhaps",
we should have known Just how we stooij
every day. but we did not.
Redington. the broker and real estate dealer
was si ven a credit of ?HÂ».000 by Genunjc and
the loss falls on us. We personally woulj
not have clven Redington or any one else any
such credit. We ,do not know whether Red-
Injjton can make good the loss we have been
called unon to meet for him. â¢
GEXUXG REMAINS SILENT.
Genung declined yesterday to make
any statement as to why he saw fit to
extend the credit of Bolton, de Ruyter
& Co. to a man who has the reputa
tion of being "a curbstone dealer."
It is common talk in stock and bond
circles that Redington has no financial
standing. He has wealthy connections
and was worth some money a few years
ago. Whether Genung expected to
share in any profits that might accrue
in the deals for Redington is a matter
of surmise.
The fact remains that Genung, man
ager for Bolton, de Ruyter & Co., ex
tonded the credit of the firm for $40,000
in behalf of a man who had no financial
standing in the stock market.
In the language of the street, Red
ington "did his business in his hat."
He received his mall at 411 California
street, and his "office" expenses did not
exceed Â«0 per month.
Men of financial standing find it diffi
cult to induce brokerage firms to ex
tend credit for them on stock transac
tions. Yet Genung, manager for Bolton,
de Ruyter & Co., "carried" Redington
for more than eighteen months to the
extent of $40,000, and the principals of
the insolvent firm say* they did not
know of the transactions until last
Wednesday,
CLOSE EASTERN ACCOUNTS.
Bolton, de Ruyter & Co. telegraphed
to Eastern brokers on Thursday to close*
out their accounts. The stock held by
the insolvent firm in the East was sold
yesterday at the early morning New
York quotations. It will not be known
for some days whether Bolton, do Ruy
ter & Co. owes any money to its East
ern correspondents or whether the firms
in the East will have any balance to
hand over to the creditors of the in
solvent local firm.
Bolton and de Ruyter admitted yes
terday that they had not exercised the
vigilance that ordinary business affairs
demand. They excused themselves on
the ground that "Genung was their
manager" and "O'Conneli their book
keeper," and that they -were busy all
the time in "looking after the corre
spondence and the stock busines on
'change."
The experts who are working on the
books of Bolton & de^Uuyter will not
finish their work for some days, but it
is known that Genung extended the
credit of the firm for certain persons
who have had no financial standing for
nearly two years.
The creditors of Bolton, de Ruyter &
Co. want to know why the principals of
the insolvent firm did not trouble them
selves to find out just how they stood
with those who invested their money
in good faith.
WILT; NOT PROSECUTE GENUXg!
Bolton and de Ruyter stated yester
day that they did not propose to take
any ster>s against Genung, their man
ager. They characterized his actions
as "bad judgment," but showed no re
sentment against the man whom they
accuse of wrecking their business ca
reer. ' â â¢ :;,'â â ' j
Attorney T. C. Van Ness, who repre
sents Bolton, de Ruyter & Co., said
yesterday that he had nothing new to
give out for publication. He repeated
his assertion that his clients did not
know until last Wednesday that Iheir
financial standing was gone or that
thoir manager had used up their* funds
for absolutely irresponsible clients.
J. J. Jelette of the firm of Jelctte &
Myefstein. the .attorneys who repre
sent the creditors of Bolton, de Ruyter
& Co., said y*terday. that the insolvent
firm of .brokers had been given an op
portunity to prepare a .statement.- and
that nothing could be done until, the
statement was secured. The committee
of the creditors, of which Jelette is the
chairman, will meet ' with "Bolton and dc
Ruyter this afternoon in order to at
tempt to straighten out the tangle of
the insolvent . brokers. . Whether the

Spring Valley Company's Of
ficials Testify at the Super
visors' Water Rates Inquiry
RECEIPTS OX INCREASE
Pointed Questions Asked Rc
gnrding' Qporating Expenses
and New Construction Item
The Board of Supervisors met last
night ns a commitee of the whole for
the purpose of resuming its investiga
tion into. the operations of the Spring
Valley Water Company, preparatory to
fixing the rates to be charged for
I water during the next fiscal year. The
: first q-uestion to be considered was that
of the revenue of the company from
all sources since July 1, 1902.
Braunhart suggested that the com
mittee take up consideration of the
property now in actual use in supply
ing water and the value thercof^-but'
Attorney M. B. Kellogg stated that
the company was not prepared to an
swer questions on that point.
Pelham Ames, secretary of the com
pany, was the first witness and he tes
tified as to the specific items going to
make up the receipts .of the corpora
1 tion during various periods. Ames, re
plying to question, said that a charge
of $12 or $15 was made to consumers
for service connections, the receipts
for which, during f903, were $7959 92.
This amount, Ames' said, was charged
to main repairs, but did not enter into
the operating expenses and was credit
ed as a "balance.".
Replying to Attorney Kellogg's ques
tion, Ames said that any profit result
ing from service connections was
credited to new construction.. D'An
cona asked why the' money collected
was notcredited as receipts and Ames
said that- the balance left after the
cost had been paid diminished the cost
of new construction.
RECEIPTS FOR (SIX MONTHS.
Chief Clerk Booker testified that the
receipts of the company for the six
months ending December 31, 1903,
were:
From private consumers $01.1.324 63
From shlppins 60,181 00
From City and County of San
Francisco CS.392 33
Total ?I^031,S98 SS
Booker estimated that the receipts
for the six months ending June 30, 190 i,
would be about $1,053,000, of which $935,
000 would be from consumers, $50,000
from shipping and $68,000 from,the city.
This estimate would make the totals
revenue of the company for the fiscal
year 1903-04 the sum of $2,OS1,S98 88. \
"We have had more than S000 new
families on our list of consumers," said
Booker, "and there has been a wonder
ful filling up of vacant houses. The
average number of vacant houses in .
1903 was 2260 computed monthly. Last I
year the average was 2361, and for the j
past ten years as high as 4219. We se
cured 1918 new customers and turned '
on. water for 1116 old consumers last
year."
Ames was recalled and testified in
detail as^to the operating expenses of ;
the company from July 1, 1902, to De

six months ending December 31, 1903,
were $274,583 16." said Ames, "and those
for the six months ending June 30, 1904.
I estimate at the same figure, or a total
of $550,000. which exceeds by $44,000 the
estimate we made at the last inquiry."
ADOPTS PROCEDURE.
On Braunhart's motion the following
procedure was adopted for the inquiry:
1. Consideration of all tlie property of the
Spr.'nir Valley Company now in use tor sup
plying water to the city, and the value thereof.
2. The character and nature of. the property
not in use and the value thereof.
H The nature and character of permanent
improvements and new construction, atid the
value and cost thereof.

expenses for the first half of the fiscal year
19C.1-1PO4. and those for the calendar year IDO:

Regarding the amount of $6S0,767 01
expended for new construction. Cyril
Williams Jr., assistant engineer of the
company, testified that the improve
ments were actually in use or are be
ing prepared for use. notably the work
on the Calaveras dam, costing $4O,22S 50.
'Then that item must be deducted
from the valuation." said Braunhart,
to which Attorney Kellogg agreed.
Williams said there was some pipe
for the Pleasanton wells not actually
used, and Kellogg promised to submit a
statement thereon. Williams said the
two boilers at the Belrnont pump, cost
ing $9254, as well as some pipe, would
be used by July 1. 1904. "Williams said
the amount of water used in 1903 from
Lake Merced was 1,696,000,000 gallons,
and he was asked to prepare a state

of the company.
Ames said the capital stock of the
new company is $23,000,000. while its
bonded indebtedness is $1,345,000. and
that of the old company $13,630,000. The
floating indebtedness of the new com
