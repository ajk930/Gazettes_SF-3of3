BT. LOUIS. Oct. 25. â A million-dol*
lar university, modeled on lines abso
lutely new in educational methods, and
a sociological colony, where unique
lfieas may be put into living practice,
is a work which has been, undertaken
by ilrs. Charles Â«Â£". Joy, wife of the for
mer St. Liouie* Congressman. Mrs. Joy,
in Â«pe;Jring of her sums, say*:
"A university in which the great trin
ity â mind, body and soulâ shall receive
proper training in conjunction has long
been ay aim. I have at last started
on the road to the realization of my ob
ject- I have succeeded in interesting
certain wealthy people whom 1 met m
California and I think have laid the
foundation for the building of a uni
versity. A splendid site has been of
fered in California.
"It will be my object to make of
the school a twentieth century institu
tion in every sense. It will be estab
lished for the discovery of every power
in nature available fof- the benefit of
man. Truly scientific investigation
will be made of psychic phenomena.
"Proper proof of the existence of the
soul is lacking to-day. I believe that
in time, with the progress which must
be made, this proof will be forthcom
ing.
"All branches of science will be fos
tered. There will be a department in
which the science of life will be taught.
Not only the laws of being will be dis
cussed, but the laws of -parentage and
the duties and responsibilities of
motherhood and fatherhood."
HARVARD MAY
BAR FOOTBALL
AS TOO BRUTAL
Action Depends Upon
the Coming Game
With Yale. *
Special DUpaXch to ThÂ« Call.
BOSTON, Oct. 25.â President Eliot of
Harvard has demanded that brutality and
unnecessary roughness shall cease In foot
ball played by Harvard teams or that
football itself shall be eliminated from
the athletic curriculum, of the varsity.
At the Yale-Harvard game in the etad
ium next month President Eliot will Bit
near the side lines with a critic of the
play. At the first sign of "slugging,"
"kneeing," face-slapping or pulling hair
he will forthwith recommend to the cor
poration that Harvard cease to partici
pate in intercollegiate football. f The
corporation could undoubtedly so vote and
football with Harvard left out would re
ceive a stunning, if not a knock-out, blow.
President Eliot Is no warm friend of
football as played to-day. His reports
have frequently been hostile, but he
has yielded to public opinion. In his
present resolve he is backed by Presi
dent Roosevelt and influential ' members
of the faculty and corporation.
President Eliot, in his annual reports j
of late years, has criticized football st- j
verely. both on account of the physical '
roughness of the play and the tendencies
to prof essionallKm and unfair methods,
especially the practice of offering "In- j
ducements" to make stars come to" this
or that college for a more or less thinly!
disguised bonus. ICot much attention
has â¢ been paid to these reports. ' but now
the head of Harvard University Intends
w- to act on his own account.
>* : Dr. Eliot was consulted ' by ' President
Rooe*rpk before the famous "peace con
ference*.'Cof the football coaches and. ex
perts, which was called' at the White
House last month and which indorsed the

AN OVATION TO FUSION CANDIDATES
Alhambra Ring: s With Shouts
oj c Mighty Multitude, ;
Decency's Champion Speaks
About "Gang's" Doings. \u25a0;
Throughout ; this great city- last night
the voters of San Francisco turned ' out
in overwhelming numbers to greet John
S. Partridge, the fusion candidate j for
the position of Mayor of the metropolis
of the West.. Although the great leader
of the Republican an"d Democratic parties
spoke to but two meetings, he faced fif
teen- hundred people at Symposium Hall,
including the many who could not crowd
into the hall, and at the Alhambra Thea
ter, near the redllghts of the tenderloin,
be spoke to forty-five hundred more, i
One of the most significant signs that
point to the election of John S. Part
ridge is the enthusiastic and popular re
ception he receives wherever he goes. To
talk to six thousand . voters In one night
is a record that has not been often ex
celled by any candidate in any campaign.
For over three hours the \u25a0 multitude lis
tened to the orators of the fusion ticket
in order to hear, the . message that Part
ridge is carrying . to the people. Three
hours the audience sat in the Alhambra
Theater without one cry, one- word., for
the opposition, and with , cheer . on cheer
for the truths uttered by the. speakers..
Before Mr. Partridge reached the thea
ter his approach was announced by the
cheers outside the building, where in the
earlier hours a crowd go dense had gath
ered that the cars .were forced to move at
snail's pace. The cheering^ without in
creased in volume as the fusion standard
bearer approached, . and was quickly
taken up by the audience as the leader
entered the theater.
In the galleries, on the stage and on
the floor men mounted the , seats ; arid
yelled themselves hoarse in an ovation
that sent the blood rushing through i the
veins. Hustled along by John Coghlan
and his ; campaign workers the fusion
leader was brushed past the outstretched
hands that attempted to stay his pro
gress and hoisted to the platform. : When
he stood there r erect and manly facing
the multitude it seemed as if he were
responding: to. the congratulations of his
followers upon his overwhelming victory.
GREETED WITH CHEERS.
Throughout . the - evening Partridge was
the watchword : for outbursts of applause
and cheering.. Whenever his name was
mentioned ; it was loudly . cheered ; .when
ever he -made a strong, score" upon the
reputations of his ; opponents he was ap
plauded, and when 1kÂ« finished. and started
to leave the hall a his' campaign \ workers
were forced to form a solid phalanx about
him to prevent the crowds eager., to' grasp
his hand from', crushing him in their, en
thusiasm. \u25a0'..'] V/ '-'':. * .~ : ' ' ; /:'--;:

Hundreds of Opposition

Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CalL
CHICAGO. Oct. 25.â Police may ba
necessary to prevent a clash between
the two factions of delegates, to th*.
Interstate Commerce Law Convention,
which will begin a - two days* session
in.'Steinway Hall at;lO o'clock to- mor- *
row morning. Officers of the organiza
tion assert that the railways hay*
brought hundreds of delegates to Chi
cago from' all parts of the country for
-the; purpose, of packing, the convention
and Â« preveneting >an indorsement :of
President" Roosevelt's plan of govern
mental , regulation of \u25a0 freight rates by
increasing the power of the InterstatÂ»
Comtrierce Commission.
The executive committee of the In
terstate Comnieree Law Association
met to-day to arrange the preliminary
programme for the meeting to be held
to-morrow. After much debate It was
decided that it would be unfair to tha
business interests of the country, which
are unaware of the attempt which the
members of the committee declare will
be made to pack the convention, to al
low any delegates to participate in the
convention, with the purpose of which
they are manifestly at variance. There
fore it was decided to have blanks pre
pared by the secretary containing tha
following extract from the President's
last message to Congress as the sole
subject to be discussed and considered
at the convention:
"The Interstate Commerce Commis
sion should be vested with the power,
whenever a given rate has been chal
lenged and after full hearing found to
be. unreasonable, to decide, - subject to
judicial review, -what shall be a rea
sonable rate to take its place, the rul
ing of the commission to take effect at
once and remain in force until it is re
versed by the court of reviews."
To all delegates claiming- to be
entitled to participation in the proceed
ings in the convention these blanks
will be offered and such a3 refuse to
sign them will be declared ineligible.
About 200 delegates had arrived in
the city this. evening and both factions
had opened headquarters in the Audi
torium Hotel. Feeling ran high and
both " sides had , numerous committees
at ?work. Interviewing, every \u25a0 delegate
who appeared on the scene. Each was
outspoken. ln its determination to con
trol the convention to-morrow.

Th*- meeting was called to order by
"William A. Kelly, secretary of the Fusion
Campaign Committee, who made a dig
nified and efficient chairman. He told of
the great meeting's that \u25a0 Partridge ad
dresses nigtitly and. gave -the reasons for
the uniting of all the decent element for
ttie cleaning out of the grafters. The
first speaker Mr. Kelly Introduced was
Fairfax H. Whelan, who was warmly
greeted and who spoke io part as fol
lows: '~'*JJ
Every man In &an ' Francisco knows that
there is to-day no difference between the Dem
ocrat and the Republican. The two grand old
parties have taken a stand shoulder to shoul
oer for the preservation of the municipality.
The grafters know this and are afraid.
CAMPAIG.V IS PROSPEROUS.
This is a prosperous campaign in a prosper
ous city. The gangster* cay the city is pros
perous because of them. The commercial and
physical advantages of San Francisco bad
nothing to do with It. and you can earn the
undying gratitude of the opposition if you can
vote them into two years more- of such prosper
ity. They take a great interest in certain
brand* of prosperity, and want It to go as far
as possible. In the city's prosperity they have
played the robber barons of old in helping
commerce by levying tribute upon It. San
Francisco Is not prosperous . because of them,
but in spite cf them. Is prosperity due to
boodl'rs and graftfrt?
Their point of view is that every man on the
fusion ticket is a Job chaser. They don't un

BRAXDEXSTEI.X FORCUFUL.
Mr. Brandenstein claimed the issue
of the campaign, was decency against
indecency. He said that Ruei" and his
appendage, Schmitz, were not the
cnampions of labor and called them
flimflam artists, adepts at the game of
"now you see it and now you don't."
The administration, he urgad., Is bogus
to the core and uses labor as it uses
religion. It desecrates and prostitutes
everything decent for the purpose of
office. The gang, he said, in conclud
ing, has but a little way to go now and
is on the run.
Frank H. Gould was nert presented
and told of the differences between .the
Republican and Democratic parties- on
national issues having no effect on the
present fight. "We're together," he
asserted, "and I'm glad. Our policies
may be different, but our ideas of civic
honesty are the same. â¢ All the time
these people have been in office they
have done nothing but graft." He con
cluded with an appeal to the women
to get their sweethearts, husbands,
brothers, sons and fathers to the polls
on election day, for never was the in
fluence of the good women of. the. city
needed as at the present time.
Supervisor A. A. d'Ancona told of the
effort to secure an underground rail
road on Sutter street and urged that the
city have the system installed on the
new Geary-street road to prove that It
was the best. He also spoke strongly
in favor of restoring the credit of the
civil service and of the graft of the
present administration. â¢ Â» - â¢
George L. Center told of the failure of
the Board of Works to keep* its promises
to the sections of the city south of .Mar-,
ket street in the matter of street work.
He told of the other conditions that exist
in the various departments of the city
government and appealed to the voters to
rid the city of the grafters. , v
Assistant District Attorney Robert Fer
ral was the last speaker preceding Mr.
Partridge and won his audience by' his
wit and sound reasoning and by his keen
thrusts at the opposition. For many years
Mr. Ferral defended criminals and kept
them out of ths prisons. For the last
three years he has assisted In putting
them In. His statement of the voting for
Schmitz is that of a man who knows
from actual observation and he predict 3
that ninety-nine out of every hundred
bunko men, vagrants, "dope" fiends and
thieves will vote the Ruef ticket.
The musical side of the evening was
furnished by the Knickerbocker Quartet,
which has a rattling good stock of.cam
paign songs. The entertainment of the
evening was furnished by M. J. ("Billy:')
Hynts, whose monologue Is the best cam
paign speech possible for re-election to an
office where nonesty is the chief requisite.
Mr. Hynes also caught the audience with
his well known clever laughing song.

NEVADAN THROWS
HIS MONEY AWAY
CHICAGO. Oct. &Â».â A. Mueller, a ranch
owner from Nevada, attempted to give
away 56331 in front of the Palmer House
this morning. He might have succeeded
had it not been for ' Policeman O. Peter- i
son, who was attracted by Mueller's ac
tions. When the policeman neared Muel
ler, the Nevadan threw, the money on the
sidewalk and called out:
"Will no one take It?"
"Yes, I will," said â¢ Peterson, as he
picked up the , money) and seized Mueller.'
Pefrson, believing he had in, custody!
one of the men who yesterday, robbed
a bank in Indiana, took Mueller,, to the
Central Police Station. "Mueller told the

of cattle at the stock yards. V He: then left,
the place and went" out for a drink.' Th'e^

BIG GAIN OF VOTES .'
IN THIRTY-FIFTH
John Connor Explains Water
and Gas Rate Question
and Brandenstein Cap
tures Audience With Talk
\u25a0Far larger than his last meeting in the
Symposium Hall on Mission street, near
Twenty-second, was the mass meeting
held there last night by John S. Partridge
and the candidates of the fusion' ticket.
The large edifice was crowded to the
doors. Many who could not gain, entrance
to the hall blocked the sidewalks" and
craned their. necks to catch the speeches
of tho fusion standard j bearer . and his
supporterson the fusion ticket. The en
thusiasm was of the real tdncere kind.
No hired applause makers. were needed
In Symposium Hall last night. The
meeting signified two things: First, that
the fight of John S. Partridge for Mayor
and. the fight of the whole fusion ticket
is gaining, great strength in the Mission,
the home of the wage earner. Secondly,
that John S. Partridge, through his im
pressive, sincere, straightforward talks,
is intrenching himself deeply in; the
hearts of the voting working classes and
is gaining votes. \u25a0 " . \u25a0 â¢
There is a deeo contrast between, the
speeches of Mayor Schmitz and. those of
the f'sion candidate. Partridge's talk is
of the honest kind. One can read honesty
In his countenance and sincerity of pur
pose in his speeches. When ; Partridge
entered Symposium Hall last night the
shouts of : applause were tremendous.
Pandemonium reigned for a few mo
ments.
SUPPORT FOR FUSIOX TICKET.
Partridge's speech, in part, was as fol
lows:
There has been a steady gain of support
for the cause of the fusion ticket during -'.it?
laet week, until to-day I believe that we -shall
eweep the city by 15,000 majority. It is not
In the legislation of bodies or in the decision
of courts that good government is found, but
In the aroused consciences of a community.
Man stands for manhood. People must know
that they must be straight to prosper.. After
the 7th of November San Francisco will stand
out once more clad In the .garments .of civic
decency.
There must be an absolute' decree of divorci
betwem â¢ polities' and - municipal government.
Only men who are known to be honest should
be elected to . office. When men hold .office
through .machine politics,; "what cah~you tx
pect of them?- They .ow-s allegiance to V the
men.who plaoe them In, office.,. Ruef haF taken
his officeholders in,, and, giving them letters
of : mark and reprisal, has launched a great
piratical syndicate and gone out to clean up
San Francisco. . '.* \u25a0 .
In conclusion Mr. Partridge said that
he meant to do everything he said he
vyould do. , "If you do not believe* me, 1 '
he eaid, "then 1 do not want the office
of i Mayor of San Francisco."
brAauexsteix's speech. y- < ?3
Henry U. Brandenstein, the candidate
for District Attorney on the fusion ticket,
made a ringing talk. Brandenstein makes
a speech in the form of a 'heart-to-heart
talk. It takes with the people. Mr.
Brandenstein says that he does not like
mud slinging and ,' he, throws none. ' His
speech last night : manifestly ' made a
marked impression of sincerity and he
was frequently stopped by 'vigorous
rounds ..of applause. . Mr. Brandenstein
presented facts in an unbiased, unpreju
diced, straightforward manner." He told
of the Schmitz-Ruef affiliation with thej
Labor party when they joined the labor
ranks in order that , they, might control
the municipal government." *ie contrast
ed the affiliation of Schmitz. with the La
bor party four years ago, when he ' first
ran for office with the speaker's work as
a Supervisor in endeavoring- ,to bring
about a peaceful meeting between, em
ployers and employed In the teamsters'
strike of 1901.
Brandenstein said further: "I am
champion of no cause except the cause of
decency and cleanliness in. office. .A. man
who goes from cathedral to synagogue
In the*' time of f poU^lcal campaign Lam
ffcol; enough- to be)ieve Is 'not genuinely
religious. The fusion : ticket is "made up
of tried men. (.Wfto knows the . men _on
the other ticket?; Are you ; going to vote
for a man whom you do not know merely
because he is placed on a certain ticket?
i GAS RATE REDUCED.
'"It is. only a^questlon whether .you
want honest men lln office and i.onest men
to serve you or . another reign of 'two
years of the Ruef-Schmitz political , ad
ministration." '-.-â¢â¢" .;." â¢â¢â¢â¢ --: \u25a0 \u25a0
Supervisor John Connor' delivered*, a
rousing. speech in which he explained the
work of the" Board of Supervisors in the
water and gas ' rates -.question. -He' said:
"In five years the board has reduced . the
gas rates from $1 50 to V, a cut of 33 per
cent. New York, Chicago, Philadelphia,
Cincinnati .and Boston pay a dollar, rate."
Cennor lauded City Attorney Long : and
John 8. Partridge \u25a0for their uprjght. work
In conjunction with the Board 'of Super
visors. \u25a0â¢â¢i i V.V. L '\u25a0â¢\u25a0"-â¢â¢ - -\u25a0 \u25a0,â¢--.- * .'â¢' -,-\u25a0\u25a0 '

SHAW FAVORS GEEAT
MERCHANT MARINE
Tells Nebraska Bankers That
the Nation Needs: More
Ships.
Special Dispatch to The Call.
LINCOLN, Neb., Oct. 24.â Secretary
Leslie 1 M. Shaw addressed the State
Bankers' Association 1 here to-day and
left the delegates < wondering- _what he
meant. After; an hour's talk on trade
expansion, with! 1 every thought tending
toward a ship subsidy as a solution,
the Secretary concluded: Â»
I don't want any one to -go away from here
and quote me as being in favor of a ship sub
iiay.'v I have never said I \u25a0 was In favor of a
ehlp Mibslrty. ' I am' in favor of the merchant
marine and -I, don't, want to be quoted as fa
vortnsf anything else. I leave it to you to
discover the way to get the merchant marine!
Shaw showed that 1 this country, "the
only ones where everything Is grown
in* abundance," originates ; but one
eighth of "the aggregate world's ex-"
ports, ; and .'urged, the need for more
markets.,". Shaw recalled the law of a
hundred years ago, which prohibited
foreign vessels from carrying goods
between two American ports. He re
called - the subsidies to rivers and har
bors andto railroads, and added:'

the -fatal plun'ce.
Soon loslny his hold on this frail

GRAVE CRISIS IN THE EMPIRE.
The Kussian railroad strike, spreading throughout the country, has precipitated a crisis in the empires St.
Petersburg and Moscow are almost in a state of siege. Communication has been interrupted and famine is feared.
In places the strike has become open revolution. Witte is in charge of the situation. .

ST. PETERSBtnG, Oct. 26, 4 a. m. â
Confronted by a situation more criti
cal t linn any Â»lnce tbe beginning of the
political and Â»oclal upheaval of Rus
sia, and which at the time this dis
patch is filed tlionn no siens of amel
ioration, the Emperor's Ministers, un
der the leadership of Count Wltte,
â¢tpent almost nil of yesterday (Wednes
day) in conferences in the hope of find
ing; some Â«Â«j" out of the crisis into
vrhich the revolutionists and the So
cialists have cast the country.
The s*neral strike on the railroads
Is complete, except in a few border
province*, and St. Petersburg, Moncoir
and other large cities are almo-J: as
cloael)' beleagruered as if they were ln
tewted by besiesine armies. At the
ume time, the industrial strike has
assumed large dimensions and the
turbulent elements in several localities
are offering: open resistance to tbe
lrooÂ»s.
The Ministers, who had been in ses
eion during the day, resumed their
meeting after a short interval for din
ner and continued their deliberations
until iong after midnight. The result
of these deliberations is not known.
The Ministers were summoned to
meet not as the committee of Minis
ters, of which Count Witte is presi
dent, but as the council of Ministers,
of which Count Solsky Is president,
and the selection of Count Witte to
preside, which was done by direction
of the Emperor, shows that a minis
terial cabinet Is actually, though not
formally, an accomplished fact. It is
understood that an edict formally es
tablishing a ministerial cabinet which
will bear the old name of "Sovyet," or
Council, will be published in the Of
ficial Messenger Saturday next, to
gether with an imperial rescript ad
crtssed personally to Count Wltte, en
trusting him with the simultaneously
created position of Premier. There ap
pears to be some Question as to
v.hether the Count will take the port
folio of finance or that of the Minis
try of the Interior.
The railroads of Finland to Helslng
fors and the steamships constitute St.
Petersburg's only means of communi
cation with the outer .world this morn

fusing to accept ordinary mall, and in
ternational correspondence is at a
standstill.
An encounter took place during the
evening between strikers and engine
drivers who were preparing to take out
trains. Revolver shots were exchanged
and a number of persons were killed or
wounded. : '\u25a0-.';_ ,â¢
GORKY'S STIRRIXG PLAY.
The strike Is complete from the factory
region on both banks of the Neva above
the- city and in several other industrial
Quarters. Forty thousand men are out,
but they are conducting themselves in a
most orderly manner. The Store Clerks'
Unlcn to-night proclaimed a two weeks'
sympathetic strike for political rights, but
it is probable that it will be enly par
tially observed. Prudent Inhabitants are
laying in stocks of provisions so as to
prepare for emergencies. As a conse
quence the prices of provisions have risen
sharply.
Large meetings, mainly of workmen,
were held last night in the university
end the higher schools, at which the sen
timent was unanimous for continuing the
strike on the railroads to the bitter end.
The proceedings at several of the meet
ings were of a strongly revolutionary
character, the orators calling on thelF
auditors to slay all Chindvniks and the
police and to meet the troops with armed
force. These speeches were received with
enthusiastic cheers. The police were
powerless to interfere, the precincts of the
university being forbidden ground to
them under an imperial ukase.
* A new sensational drama by Maxim
Gorky, entitled "The Children of the
Bun," dealing with revolution in Russia,
which four months ago would probably
have landed its author in prison, was
presented here for the first time last
night and seats for it were sold out sev
eral weeks in advance. The play satir
izes the Russian higher classes and for
the first time a scene Is allowed to be
presented on the Russian stage in which
the people rise to revolt against the di
rectors who are endeavoring to save them
from cholera. This scene shows the su
perstitltlon and brutality of the Russian
moujik when once aroused. The play, al
though finely presented. Is brutal and

EKATERINOSLAV, Russia, October
25. â Two bloody conflicts occurred
here to-day between f the trooss and
demonstrators. The first took place
opposite the municipal buildings and
the second near the Pushkin monu
ment Fifteen persons were killed and
twenty-six wounded by the volleys
fired by the soldiers. The demonstrat

A meeting of the students of the
schools who are on strike was dis
persed by the police, who made free
use of their whips. Many students
were Injured.
The courts, banks and other public
offices . have been closed.
It Is reported that the strikers have
taken possession of a train, which was
approaching Ekaterinoslav, end have
destroyed the station buildings along
the line.
STREXGTH OP MOVEMENT.
ST. PETERSBURG. Oct. 25.â The
British Embassador, Sir Charles Har
dinge, who bade farewell to Emperor
Nicholas yesterday previous toTleaving
St. Petersburg on a mission in connec
tion with) the proposed Anglo-Russian
understanding, was unable to start for
England this morning because no
trains were running. Later in the day
the Embassador left St. Petersburg by
way of Finland.
The Social-Democrats believe they
have the Government at their mercy,
since, with the railroads stopped, the
authorities are powerless :^to transport
troops. This is all the more serious as
bloody collisions already have been
reported at various places and a dan
gerous agrarian movement has again
broken out in the Government of Sa
mara. , .
The strength. displayed by the Social -
Democrats has amazed the authorities,
who were taken quite as much by sur
prise at the evidence o. their power as
they were, at the time qt the Gapon re
bellion.
The distress in the central provinces Us
greatly increased by the enforced sus
pension of the famine relief work.
Prince Hilkoff, the Minister of Rail
roads, whose appeals to the strikers at
Moscow were co unavailing that he could
not get an engineer to bring him to
St. Petersburg, but who, with a fireman
stoking, drove his own engine, arriving
here black and dust-grimed, is not
blamed for the failure of the Govern
ment to keep its promises made In the
spring to increase the wages of the rail
road men. That responsibility rests on
the Minister of Finance. Prince Hilkoff
expects to meet the railroad delegates
here, but apparently they have already
burned their bridges at meetings held
last night and which continued until
dawn this morning.
COU.VT WITTIS HOWLED DOWN.
Count Witte, receiving a deputation, in
formed his visitors that a law permitting
greater freedom of meetings than al
lowed by the laws of Italy and Austria-
Hungary and providing for freedom :of
the press had already been elaborated.
Martial law on the railroads, he said,
was an anachronism which would-, be
abolished. The demand for a constitu
ent Assembly, the Count said, could'not
be realized, nor could universal suffrage
be admitted, as all the people are not pre
pared to exercise the right of franchise.
In. this connection the Count spoke of
the power wielded by capital in America,
where universal- suffrage existed: He
thought It possibleto meet the demands
for an eight-hour day, especially for out
door workers, V and warmly favored . the
general measures . advocated with ' the
view to improving ; the of the
worklngmen,- especially In the way -of
schools and hospitals.' . â¢
Count Witte -warned . the deputation
that a contnuation of the. strike could
only /result in bloodshed, either by com
pelling: the c Interference " of the military;
or by the f amlne-stricken populace of ' the
cities " turning * upon '\u25a0. the' strikers. ' ,
In conclusion Count Wltte advised the
men to â¢ return to work, but his ' advice

strike was adopted.
Prince Hilkoff believes that the strike
cannot be prolonged, as the men are
withuot funds.
SMALL PAY OF THE MEN.
There are 400,000 railway, employes in the
empire and their average wage is $140 per
annum.
The Radical papers are In " open sym
pathy with the strikers. The Nashashlsn
has been confiscated. . The Slovo (Liberal)
condemns the strike as a colossal blunder.
"Hitherto," the papeiÂ»says, "the strug
gle has been against the bureaucracy.
The present movement injures the whole
nation, impoverishing the people and driv
ing them to excesses to get food. It will
play into the hands of the â¢reactionaries,'

: Hospital trains having on board 500 sick

communication with the capital.
MOSCOW, Oct. 25.â This city to-day re

PLANS RIPENING
AT THE HAGUE
Speculation Rife Whether
Delegate Will Be Received
From the* Vatican in Rome
TO MEET NEXT SPRING
ftalylExpects Soon 'to Have
Outline of the Programme
to Be Proposed by Russia
ROME, Oct. 25.â The Italian Govern
ment: expects to receive in the near fu
ture the programme of subjects to be
discussed by; the second peace conference
at The Hague, called by the Emperor of
Russia. It Is thought that the conference
will meet next spring and that Russia
will be represented by a delegation head
ed by M.Nelidoft*. Russian Embassador
at Paris, and M. de Maartens, former pro
fessor of. international law at the Uni
versity of St. Petersburg.
Pourparlers have passed between The
Hague and Rome regaruing the participa
tion of the Vatican In the conference
When the Hrst conference was convoked.
Emperor Nicholas, who was on very cor
dial terms with . Pope Leo, sent to the
"Vatican a note identical wkh that ad
dressed to all the .powers. , :The Italian
Cabinet, which then had General Velloux
at its head, successfully took the ground
that the presence of a papal delegate at
the conference would be offensive to
Italy and would be interpreted as the
recognition of the Pope as a temporal
sovereign. Great Britain assisted In this
opposition, asking Italy in return to sup
port her in having matters regarding the
Transvaal and the Orange Free State ex
cluded from discussion. As a protest
against its exclusion, the Vatican with
drew from The Hague Monsignor Tarnas
si, the papal nuncio, who afterward died,
it was beiieved, from grief. ,
Now that the relations between the Ital
ian Government and the Vatican have be
come more friendly, the Cabinet of Pre
mier Fortis has no objection to the Vati
can being invited, but a plausible reason
must be found for the change so that
what was in 1599 a victory" for Italian
diplomacy should not now appear to be a
defeat or to be due to a good understand
ing between church anu state which both
have no desire to emphasize.
Besides, for the Vatican, as well as for
the South and Central American repub
lics, there" is the difficulty that the sec
ond i conference must be opened by dele
gates of countries which participated in
the first, and these delegates will decide
whether other delegates shall be adfnit
ted. It Is expected also that at this time
the admittance of the Vatican will be
especially opposed by France.

JENNIE C. DUXPffiT
GIVES TESTDIONY
Takes 3lother\s Place in Ac
tion Over Mechanics*
Liens.
Miss Jennie . Dunphy was on the wit
ness stand in Judge Seawell's court yes
terday to .testify in the suit to foreclose
a mechanics' lien of $1530 on property on
Mason street, now known as the Hay
market Theater.
The building, which is owned by Mrs.
Carmen IT. Dunphy, was leased to
George Kohn and by him sub-leased to
Lus Cooper, who opened the Terrace
Gardens therein. Much work was done
on the place to convert it into a play
house and finally it was closed, not
proving a paying venture. Subse
quently it was leased to other parties,
who opened the Haymarket Theater
therein.
Several of the contractors that con
verted the place into the Terrace Gar
dens failed to secure pay for the work
done, so they riled suit against Kohn,
Cooper and Mrs. Dunphy. As Mrs.
Dunphy is not in good health, her
daughter, JÂ«>nnl<\ was called to the
stand in her place. Miss Dunphy tes
tified that for two years her mother's
befclth has been such that she has left
all of her affairs in thÂ«Â» hands of her*
a prints. She received no notice of the
fart that the contractors had not been
paid and knew nothing of the filing of
_. the mechanics' liens.

WEST ARRAIGNS
THE COMMANDER
Special Dispatch to The Call.
VALL.EJO, Oct. 25.â Commander Lucien
Young, commanding officer of the Ben
nington, may not be convicted of the spe
cifications filed against him by the Sec
retary of the Xavy. but he will long re
member the grilling he received this
morning at the. hands of Judge Advocate
West during the concluding hours of the
court-martial. West spoke without feel
ing, but the slow and measured tone of
his arraignment of ths lax methods
aboard the ill-fated ship was in such
contrast to the long and eloquent appeal
| of Judge Gear that the spectators were
deeply moved by his utterances.
West deplored what he called the mud
slinging tactics of the Hawaiian attorney
I and laid the foundation of his appeal by
treading from the regulations, .which
j charge tha. the commanding officer will
j be held responsible for the failure of his
: subordinates to perform their duty and
that the blame for such delinquencies
rests on the captain of the ship. He said
that there were more than 200 valves in
the four boilers of thÂ£ Bennington and
that if they were lifted weekly as re
quired no one had been found to remem
ber such a routine. -He added the hand
lifting gear had ban out of order for
some time prior to the disaster and that
the safety valve of boHef "B" had not
I been blown off for eighteen months.
I This same valve had not been
j repaired for a year previous to the
explosion, and if Young had examined the
ship's log he would have noticed the
lax method .of the engine-room crew.-
West stated that the log of the ship
proved nothing as it was doctored .to suit
: the convenience ,of Young and to cover
up the lax discipline aboard ship. Gear
and Young looked fiercely at West when
this statement was made and every one
In the court became interested when West
dramatically held up the ship's log and
pointed to an entry which read: "Con
nected boiler 'A' with boilers *C and
"D" at 4l:30 o'clock," and oh the next
llne."6team. formed at 10:45 a. m."
Both of these entries -were on the date
on which the explosion occurred and the
hour stated was after the accident took
place. "How do we know but that the en
tire log is cooked up." asked West, and
the silence that filled the courtroom
caused Young, to move uneasily.
West delved further Into the records ..of
th? ship's leg and showed that only
twelve Sunday inspections had been
made out of the thirty-five ; In which
Young was aboard the Bennington. West
wound up his argument by reminding the
board that the inexperience of Ensign
Wade should have made Young even more
cautious in his dealing with the engine
room section of his crew.. s V
West with an explanation of his posi
tion stated that he had none but friend
ly ftelings toward Young, but the great
cat danger to the American navy to-day
is from within and not from without;
that while the people are generously, giv
ing up their money that the American
tj^vy shall possess fighting, craft as- mod
ern and as "' powerful us any \u25a0 power,
it Is impossible to recruit enough men of |
the dtsirabie class" to man the new yes- |
sels of the navy. He reminded the court j
of the effect that will be produced in the
navy and throughout the entire country â¢
if an officer commanding a ship where lax
discipline prevailed and where sixty-five
men's lives were blotted out is allowed to
continue "his service in the navy as the
commanding officer of a warship. '
The board went Into executive session
this afternoon to consider/ the evidence.
It Js believed that a verdict will be
reached to-morrow night and forwarded
to- Washington for the concurrence. of the'
President and the Secretary ;of the Navy

MOTIIEK A VICTIM

Witness Tells of Mrs: BertHa
Elliiig ; liouse ? s Mental
'/ Condition. \u25a0/".:.: v
To prove that the last days of her
mother on earth were marked .by hal
lucinations that .rendered her incom
petent to make a will. Mrs. Emma
Stone, daughter of the late :Ber
tha Ellinghouse, took the stand in
Judge- : Coff ey's court ; yesterday. .One
of the most marked indications of her
mother's unsouhdness of mind. Mrs.
Stone said, was her refusal up to the
last to believe that Her son, Alfred, had
preceded her to the grave.
"One day," I was sitting beside ray.
mother's i bed," said Mrs. Stone, "when
she startled me by saying: 'Jennie,
don't you hear him? He is not dead;
that is he coming.'
"'Who is coming,' r said to my
mother, and' she answered:
'\u25a0'..-, "*Why, Alfred: .1 hear him "coming.
He is not dead.' \u25a0"
"Until she passed away," said Mrs.
Stone, "she clung to the hope that Al
fred would return to her; that he was
not dead, and that the statement that
he had died was made only to deceivje
her." * '.-.;'
Mrs. Stone further testified that on
the last day she saw her mother, her
mother told her .'that she would nevei
make a will and 'that she wished her
children,, the witness, Edward and Os
car â¢ Ellinghouse," to share and share
alike. 'Mrs. Ellinghouse' left prac
tically all of her estate to her son Os
car, and Mrs. Stone and Edward Ell
inghouse "charge that he secured it
through; the exercise of undue ' Influ
ence when she', was mentally unsound.
John A. Phelps, a clerk, at the Hotel
Repelier, where Mrs. Ellinghouse re
sided' for. some . months \ prior to . her
death, "was: also called as a witness.
Phelps testified that in his opinion Mrs.
Ellinghouse was: insane for some time
prior to .her death, and cited instances
of^ her- peculiar conduct that led him
to reach the conclusion.
', The case goes on again to-day. .

[.Library 'ls now possessed shall be used In the
erection pf the building. We estimate that a
building adequate for the purpose will. cos,t
approximately $40,000.. If the moneys you have
available should prove insufficient we will
make up the deficiency. â¢ The building: I shall
bear the name "Mercantile Library Branch.''
together with such other inscriptions as you
may. deem essential to the preservation of a
knowledge of Its origin and historic associa
tions. In thi9 bulldinc shall- be v placed all of
the -books suitable for a branch library now
in, your collection, and we will from time
to time add such new publications as may be
appropriate to a branch collection. All books
received from you shall be marked with a
booKplate bearing a statement to the effect
that the books are. a gift of .the Mercantile
Library Association. -Such of your books as
would more appropriately have a place In a
large collection of scholarly works -rather than
In one designed for ' the active circulation of
a branch, we will place In our main library,
where they \u25a0 will . be properly cared for In the
\u25a0;Tiew bulldinc about to be erected. Inasmuch
as *he Mercantile \u25a0 Library is one of the htÂ»
toric associations of our city, we will airree
to create in our new building a separate Ue
partment to include our combined collections
of Callforntana. to be known as the Mercantile
Library department >or such title as may be
mutually axreed. upon.
WILL ASSUME LEASE.
In order to release 'you from any obligations
imposed, by the lease of the premises you now
occupy we will. If desired, undertake to con
duct the library In the quarters it now oc
cupies as a branch of the Public Library for
a period not to exceed six months, retaining.
with your recommendation, the present libra
rian In charge. -In. this manner we would
become responsible for the payment of the
rent, salaries and the other expenses for main
tenance.
We are cognizant of .the important place
which for more than half a century the Mer
cantile Library has occupied- in the Intel
lectual Ilfe,of_.Â«ur city, and- we regret that
clrc'umstances'Â°seem td-mafc^it unwise for It
to longer continue a separate existence. Should
you .decide to merge n with the Publlp Li
brary you would merely be following the
course which has already been adopted by
many similar institutions throughout the
United States. The Public Library Is firmly
established, and has an Insured Income that
will, increase with the growth of our city.
With the enlarged facilities which will be
provided by. the. magnificent building shortly
to be erected for It at a cost of $1.000,GG0 it is
destined to fill a still larger place in San
Francisco's intellectual activities.
Before coming -to any final decision as to
the disposition of the library we would urge
upon your members a careful consideration of
all that we herein undertake on -the part of the
Public Library, and we would furthermore beg
to remind them that . should they place the
Mercantile Library In. our keeping they are
giving up no rights or privileges therein which
they now enjoy. They would merely be assign
ing it to us as a trust to be administered for
the benefit, not only of \u25a0 themselves but of the
entire community. But the privileges of the
library. and the use of the books would be
theirs to enjoy as freely as under present con
ditions. Not only this, but they . would enjoy
the added facilities of the combined resources
of two great libraries. Instead of being able
to draw only from a collection of 75,00t> vol
umes, they would have at their command, at
one place and under one roof.. a .library of more
than 200,000 volumes. While not In a position
to go into detail at this time, still we are at
liberty to state that there are other large col
lections In. San .Francisco that ultimately will
be consolidated with the Public Library, and
this upbuilding of a great library appropriate
ly housed In the magnificent building, for the
erection , of which the people of the city have
already I made ample provision, .is a matter
which should have the earnest support of all
who .are interested in our municipal growth
and are animated' by civic pride. ThÂ«'fact of
having one of the largest and best collections
of books to be found In any. public .library
of the country w.ould not only be the source. of
great convenience and satisfaction to our own
people', but redound to our credit abroad.
PRESEHVIXG THE' JfAME. "
\u25a0In view of the proposition which you have
made to us we have already In the tentative
plans for the new library tmllding made, ample
provision for the proper care of such books as
may. come to us. and for the setting apart of
such special collections as it may seem wise to
segregate from the general" collection. With
the better facilities afforded by the new build
ing we shall be able . to give freedom of access
to an : even greater number of books than is
possible In our present quarters. A special
open, shelf room will be devoted to' the popular
books for circulation, while the' large reference
rooms contemplated will afford 'access ' to our
splundld collection, for. purposes cX study and
research. . \u25a0
It might be well also to state that we will
undertake to keep your books properly Insured
against risk 'by fire,' the Insurance money col
lected by reason, of destruction of your books,
or any.^of -them, to b,e i expended ln_ the re
placement of the books so destroyed..
In placing this matter before \u25a0 you,- we are
acting, as we believe, not only In behalf of the
institution . which the people of San Francisco
have committed to our charge, . but for the

The row is over the late pastor. Rev.

Those who have left the church are his
supporters. They also claim that the
church is filled with worldiness and say
they have a grievance against the church

POLICE BATTLE
WITH STUDENTS
CHICAGO, Oct. 25.â Twenty-five police
men and 200 students of the Chicago Col
lege of Dental Surgery engaged in a fierce
fight this afternoon and before order was
restored fifteen of the students had been
arrested. At one point during the fight
the police were forced to fire shots over
the heads of the students to scare them
back.
The freshman and junior classes of the
institution met in their annual class rush
to-day and the battle became so desper
ate that a riot call was sent in to the two
police stations in the vicinity. When the
police arrived on the scene the battle be
tween the students had been in progress
for a half hour and had blocked all the
street car and wagon traffic in nearby
streets.
The students who were in the thick of
the fight joined forces as soon as they
saw the approach of the patrol wagons,
and the bluecoats were pelted on all sides
with stones and vegetables, while water
was poured upon them by students from
the upper floors of the college. After this
had been going on for some time and the
police were getting decidedly the worst of
the -battle the" bluecoats drew their re
volvers and fired several shots. This
brought the students to their senses and
they ran in all directions, but the po'ice
succceeded in making fifteen captures.
All the students bore signs of the con
flict in their torn garments, and a number
of them suffered severe cuts about their
heads and faces from the punishment ad
ministered by the police.
An investigation has been begun by the
faculty and the ringleaders of the dis
turbance will be punished. >^ ;

VANDERBILTS
INVADE OHIO
CINCINNATI. Oct. 25.--The Pittsburg
and Lake Erie Railroad Company has
purchased the coal lands and railroads
of the Little Kanawha syndicate, which
are in litigation In the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati.
The deal was made by 'Joseph Ramsey
Jr., former president of the Wabash sys
tem. Ramsey and George Gould did not
differ on this proposition. They, ap
peared together through counsel before
Judge John K. Richards to-day, defend
ing their interests, to prevent John Jones
of Chicago. from interfering with the sale.
The Pittsburg and Lake Erie isa
Vanderbilt line. It will come into the
new coal field through Pittsburg. The
several railroad lines which are integral
parts of the Little Kanawha will be used
by the Vanderbilts to make a new line
through Virginia to the Atlantic sea
board. This is one of the greatest rail
road deals of recent times.
The property which \u25a0 the Vanderbilts
thus acquire is composed of the Little
Kanawha Railroad Company, the Park

George G^Srhart,
Dairyman,; Is _
Grilled "' 7
Court Fixes; : Heayy^
Fine to Warn %
Dealers:
Holds the ;Qffehse
toiÃe Serious and
Grave.
After a battle that was fought with
full knowledge of the consequences of
a conviction, George C. Sniart, proprie
tory of the New York Dairy and vice
president of the California' Dairymen's
Association, was found guilty- yester
day by Police Judge George H.':Ca-.
baniss of selling milk which was
drugged with formaldehyde.
Such was the result of the relentless
prosecution which was forced by Eu
gene Lent, father of Frances and Ruth
Lent, children who were critically ill
from drinking the poisoned stuff from
Smart's dairy.
Despite the attempt of ' Smart's at
torney, E. D. Knight, to mitigate the 1
situation, Judge Oabaniss vigorously
denounced the offending milk
and as an earnest of. the court's atti
tude toward the case imposed a fine of
$200, the maximum amount under the
statute.. This punishment, his Honor'
declared, would serve, he hoped, as a
warning to other dairymen "and as a
notice that the grave seriousness of 'the
Lent case was not underestimate^ He
intimated that a much higher fine
would have been imposed if the; law
permitted.
The conviction was a blow at the in-
dustry of milk adulteration. It came
as; a block to the practices of dishon
est and unscrupulous;" dairymen who
would toy with the lives and the health
of their customers in the 'hope of hiere
money projlt and gain. And Judge Ca
baniss spaYed nothing in his excoria
tion of milk- dealers who resort ; to
adulterants', t to poisonous drugs, to'dis
ease-breeding â¢ sophistication . of- : .the
character that was exposed 'at '\u25a0â¢the
trial of -Smart. He was' thoroughly
convinced that the illness of Lent's
children was due to the formaldehyde
in the milk Smart served that' house
hold. So firmly set was the opinion
that the effort of Attorney Knight ; to
have Dr,,L. H. Hoffman's testimony on
that point expunged froni the record
failed.
SMART KNEW OF DRUGS.
Equally positive was Judge Cabaniss
that Smart himself had knowledge' that
preservatives were belng^'u'sed. in the
dairy's milk, despite 1 Smart's denials.
In this phase* his "Honor Ãeviewed' the
testimony of Joseph Block,, manager "of
the Preservallne Manufacturing Com
pany, who had sworn he had business
dealings with the New York Dairy and
had sold Smart preservallne.
Judge Cabanisa said; he felt . this to
be. the worst feature of the case so far
as Smart was concerned, for the dairy
man had attempted, and very emphat
ically, under oath, â¢to convince, the
court that no preservatives or adul
terants had ever been used by his"
dairy.
After the case was called yesterday
morning Attorney Knight began an ar
gument on a motion to strike, out Dr.
Hoffman's testimony. Dr.- Hoffman had
attended the Lent children. He had de
clared them toi be suffering seriously
from formaldehyde poisoning. Ho had
gone with unpleasant detail into the
nature of formaldehyde, and had told
Judge Cabaniss that in medical prac
tice the drug was used as an embalm
ing fluid.. Attorney William F. Humph
rey-, Lent's law partner, and special
counsel- for . the . prosecution, resisted
the motion and gained his point. The
evidence was allowed to stand.
Having cleared that preliminary, At
torney Knight went to his discussion .of
the proposition whether, under ! the stat
ute,- Smart could be helÂ«T convicted, even
.though no proof had -been made that ;he
In person had drugged the milk or- had
personal knowledge of the presence "of
poisonous substances in the .fluid. ; \u25a0\u25a0". ''. \u25a0
Judge Cabaniss held that the testimony
identified the milk, and there had been no
disputing* the declarations of Arthur
Price, the chejnist, \u25a0 that it contained
formaldehyde. This made out a technical
case against Sniart. The only other point
was whether the law contemplated the
conviction of one who had no willful in
tent.;
Knight protested that his client should
be punished if he . had . knowingly 'used
foreign ' substances; but he contended
Smart did not have such knowledge. The
attorney did not blame Lent, nor did
he Impugn anything.' wrong, to any one
when he ; said \u25a0 the formaldehyde might
have been placed in the, milk for revenge.
Knight 'contended that there were times
when "any dairyman's \ milk might tgo
wrong ; [ that milk does 'not always agree
with'a person; that he would cair the.at
tention of the press to these conditions/
But Judge ; Cabaniss shut' off these sug
gestions and with a final Intimation that
he had made up his mind as to the bear
ing of the -law, said:: ."Your- argument,
Mr. Knight, puts your client in the light
of a doomed man *, whom the Sheriff has
permitted to; talk from the scaffold."-
WANTS EXAMPLE MADE.
-Attorney Humphrey, pointed \u25a0; out In. re
ply to Knight that 'there were seven [con
tradictions between^ the . testimony * of
Smart and.his son,', and Joseph Block, the
preservaline man. Humphrey declared it
was ' time' an example shold 'be shown.
."The leniency hitherto exhibited In .these
dairymen's cases is the " cause ? of this
prosecution,"" said the -'attorney. '2 "We
think there should be more '"than '"a ' fine
imposed, ; but we leave this 'to the 'court."
\u25a0;. Judge; ; Cabaniss,' . , without "more, 7 - 'aAol

poison.- If it could be proved that a per
son had put the stuff in the milk the
maximum of penalty against that individ
ual would be none too severe.
"The worst feature of the case as bear
ing upon Smart is his testimony about
preservatives. He desired it to be em
phatically understood that he never
placed foreign substances in his milk. His
son strenuously insisted that there was
no occasion Ifor using' drugs because his
milk was delivered fresh from the cows

Telephone Exchange 609 this morning
has caused such serious and almost fatal
co.nsequences. To impose a light punish
ment would be to put. a premium on this
form of pernicious activity along that
line of business activity. The punish
ment, outside of the effect of the public
advertising given such a case, should be
such as. to- make it a very expensive
matter to sell adulterated milk. The
maximum fine under this statute, I ob
serve, is only' s2oo. In most other statu
tory misdemeanors' the fines range as
high as $500 and $1000. The Judgment of
the court -.is that the defendant. George
C. Smart.' pay a fine of $200,. 0r. in default
thereof be 'imprisoned for fifty days in
the County Jail." :
Attorney Knight filed a bond in $500
on appeal and Smart was released, pend
ing action by the higher court. Knight,
when asked whether the appeal would be
fected, said he thought so. He also de
clared that" the California Dairymen's
Association had nothing to do with
Smart's defense.
C. N. Johnson, a dairyman, pleaded
guilty yesterday in the Police Court of
using boron in his milk and failing to
so label his bottles. Judge Cabaniss fined
Johnson $10. which was paid.
E. A. Green of the Millbrae California
Milk Company, was arrested on a charge
of using coal tar dye in milk. John
Linehan, proprietor of the Green Valley

ARSON IS CHARGED
AGAINST MAYER.
Explosion ; of Gasoline Results
in a Damaging Blaze.
MERCHANT IS UNDER SUSPICION'
OAKLAND, Oct. 25.â The explosion of a
gasoline stove In a two-story frame build
ing at Point Richmond this morning re
sulted in a fire that will cost the owners
of the property between $35,000 and $40,000.
It. will also result In the arre6t of A. S.
Mayer, a merchant, who recently engaged
In business In the building, and who is
wanted Tjy the police on a charge of arson.
It was at first supposed that the fire
started by the explosion of the stove,. but
later Investigations, proved that- the ex
plosion was not accidental. In fact, it
was shown that the fire must have been
the result of a plot to destroy the prop
erty, , and H. B. Kenney, the agent,
promptly swore to an arson complaint be
fore Justice of the Peace Hull. '
Mayer came to Point Richmond several
months ago and started} in business under
the name -of the Eastern Dry Goods Com
pany. His store was in the Crighton
building in the "triangle" district.
His business did not prosper, and the
disastrous fire this morning has caused
all sorts of speculation as to the origin of
the blaze. It is the belief of the peace
officers that it was of incendiary origin.
The blaze was at first discovered in
Mayor's dry goods store In the Crichton
building: on Richmond avenue. It was ex
tinguished before any damage had been
done, but soon after it was found that a
woodÂ»n partition was ablaze, from no
apparent cause. The firemen worked
hard, but their efforts were useless and
soon the building was a mass of ashes.
The loss to Mayer's dry goods store was
covered by insurance. He estimated hie
stock at $3500 and his Insurance at $3300.
"\V. Crighton' owned the building: and it
was valued at $5000. It was partially In
sured.
From the Crighton building the flames
spread to the building and hall of Thomas
Schad. which was destroyed. Schad's loss
will amount to $9000.
H. \V. Hunger, who conducted a saloon
In Schad's building, estimates his loss at
$1000. The other losses are: Richmond
Creamery $1000, Russell & Elsie $1000. H.
B. Kenney, G. W. Entrician and H. C.
Barlow with their families resided in the
upper portion â¢of the Crighton building
and they have each lost $1000. A. Odell,
who owned a small outbuilding adjoining
the Crighton property, estimates his loss
at $500. . . .-â¢ , â¢
POINT RICHMOND, Oct. 25â J. C. Mayer
and wife were arrested this afternoon on
a charge of arsQn preferred by H. B. Kln
ney, the superintendent of the Richmond
Electric Light and Power Company.
Mayer and his wife conducted the store
in which the flre started this morning.
Kjnney's apartments were above the
store. The- evidence is said to \*s_ very
strong against the Mayers. They placed
a heavy insurance policy on their stock
only a few days ago. They were taken
to the County Jail at Martinez to-night
and. will have an examination within a
few days. \u25a0

Many things combined to rob the wedding
of Miss Hazel B. Camp and Dr. E. K. Evans
last night of a commonplace aspect. The bride,
one of the charming daughters of Mr. and Mrs.
James Camp, has decided opinions of her own,
with excellent taste as well, and : the result
was one of the prettiest weddings' of the sea
son. The decorations, of white and green,
with a suggestion of pink, were admirable. A
net 'entert wined f_. with white blossoms^ was
shaped Into a canopy. From Its arch pink
satin ribbons were drawn to the chandelier
and suspended In the center was a great Chi
nese hat completely covered with white blos
eoms. As the newly married pair turned to
receive congratulations the hat was tilted by
means of a ribbon and showers of rose leaves
and confetti fell upon them.
The brlda's gown of white silk voile was
simply 'but prettily made. No veil was worn,
a shower of Bride roses completing the girlish
costume. , .-,â¢-> .."â¢.. , .
Miss Nettle Camp was maid 'of \u25a0 honor, her
gown being a blue embroidered Brussels- net;
and she carried pink carnations. There were
V Â«U- bridesmaids, all In white chiffon gowns
made over pink silk, and as the bride entered

FIRE REVEALS
COLLEGE SECRET
Lone Life of Freshman in
\u25a0 Hills Is MadedinownWlien
Flames Destroy His Teirt
BERKELEY, Oct. 25.â Professor George
C. Edwards, "student adviser" at th,e
university, has un,earthed what he con
siders an extraordinary case, of sturdy
Independence and pride in a freshman
whose total belongings are reported to
have Ijeen destroyed in the great fire that
swept the Berkeley hills two weeks'ago.'
L. L. Loud is the freshman who is
looked upon by the veteran Colonel Ed
wards as being made of the stuff which
great men have in their composition. The
freshman, according to " reports brought
in to Colonel Edwards, lost everything "He
had In helping to fight the fire, with
other univen-ity students', but although
provision had been made for reimbursing
such losses of s^tudetits \ and.,, although
Loud is poorâ so poor that he lived alone
in a tent in the. hills back of the uni
versity, the freshman has thus far 'de
clined to avail himself of the provision
made for reimbursing him.
L. L. Loud entered, college in August,
taking work in the social science courses,
lie is registered as from 310 Minna street,
San Francisco. He made his home in a
tiny tent up in the hills, in Strawberry.
Canyon. He cooked for himself and lived
a hermit life.- By night he studied dili
gently and by. day was. as other students,
so that no one knew of his uriique habi
tation in the hills under a canvas cov
ering. \u0084 â¢'-' â¢ '*,
The fire that devastated the hills and
laid bare the canyons and sequestered
places of the hillside served to reveal
Loud's little, humble secret. His hidden
eelf-sacriflces were made known when the
flames lit up the spot where he bad'
pitched his tent, and in the destruction of
all his belongings Loud's fellow-students
were made acquainted with the] attempts
of the San Francisco youngstet to, ILV6
and get a college education under ,rfhe
handicap that found expression "in' the
life in a tent, alone on the hillside.

voir has just been completed here. It is
situated In the Palolo Valley, about five
miles away, and is nothing more or less
than an extinct crater., with a dam across
an ancient breaqh. In its wall.
| ,vThe..crater.has held a certain amount of

pokes a misty 'head .Into the clouds .which
are piled up by. the trade, winds most of
the year, '. and as. a consequence the al
most continuous rainfall keeps the
streams running into It full. The outlet
for this accumulation of water has been
on the windward side toward the Wal
manalo plantation and the newly set
tled Palolo . Valley's springs, have
proved Insufficient.
Investigation showing that the water
from the high crater fed these springs
the residents of the valley determined to
dam up the breach In the crater, and this
has been done with a 12-foot wall. The
effect was almost immediate, and now,
no matter how. dry the weather in the
valley, the springs gush forth fully, mak
ing altogether a natural water works sys

"BOGIE" MATTER
UP TO STUDENTS

YELLOW SLIP IN FAVOR
Many Regard Publication as
Useful Institution, but Cen
sure Use of Co-Eds'' Names
Special Dispatch to ThÂ« CalL
STANFORD UNIVERSITY. Oct. 25.â
The all absorbing topic of the community
of Stanford University la what action
will the faculty committee take regarding
the "Bogrie" affair. Professor R. L. Green,
chairman of the committee on student af
fairs, to-day stated that In hia estimation
It was - not a matter that concerned the
faculty as much as . It did the students.
'.'lt knocks the undergraduate community
as well and perhaps harder than It does
us and we are already used to that sort
of thing," declared the instructor with a
touch of dry humor.
In his estimation it would be a compara
tively, simple matter for any committee of
earnest upper class men residing in the
"hall" to ferret out the guilty parties and
"ship" them. If the students preferred,
after apprehending the culprits, to turn
the matter over to the proper authorities
of the university. Professor Green has no
doubt that the offenders would be
promptly "taken to the edge of thÂ«
campus and dropped over."
\ The proposition as set down by the bead
of the faculty committee has not been
laid before any executive body of the
students and it Is therefore difficult to
determine what action the students will
take. The spirit on the "Quad" is, how
ever, strongly in favor of "Bogies" in
genera] as being one of the most conveni
ent and eloquent ways of pointing out
to their Instructors certain errors in their
system. There' is. however, much indig
nation expressed over certain passages of
the present "yellow slip." in which the
attempts to appear humorous over
stepped the bounds of propriety and bor
dered closely on vulgarity. Another point
strongly maintained is that the names of
co-eds should never be permitted to en
ter into any such, publications. \u25a0'.'

PALO ALTO. Oct. 25.â Ten thousand
books of general descriptive matter about
Palo Alto and its suburbs are beio^
printed by the local Board of Trader
These books will be distributed among
th ereal estate firms in San Francisco.
San Jose, and Eastern cities, as well as
sent to all inquirers of the advantages of
this place. Already 1000 pamphlets ara
being sent out each month by the secre
tary of the board, following its' plan of
systematic advertising. The results,
which have been favorable, suggested
the issue that is now almost ready for
distribution. â¢\u25a0.-\u25a0.'â¢
A just claim is being made by the Board
of Trade that Palo Alto has more JSOQU
homes in proportion to Its size than any
ether coast city. Ideal climatic advan
tages, elevation above the malarial
swamps, the location near to San Fran
cisco and the pure water supply arÂ«- ail
mentioned hi the new book.
' The success of the local public utili
ties, which are operated by tha town, is
mentioned. The revenue 'from -the water
system; electric lighting and gas plant
almost paid the entire expenses of city
government for the last fiscal year. This
is considered a remarkable showing fcr a
town so young.
By an issue of $90,000 bonds for munici
pal improvements the expenses will be in
creased, but this Is to be done so- the total'
tax rate .will be less than one dollar, ji

GREETING TO PRESIDENT
Chief Executive Is Heartily Gheefed by the
Citizens of Little Rock.
Strong Denunciation of Lynching Meets With
the Approval of the People. . -
KITTLE ROCK, Ark., OcL 25.âPresi
- dent Roosevelt spent seven crowded
tours in and around Little Rock to
day, and his Journey from Fort Logan
H. Root, in Big- Rock, on the north
BlQe of the Arkansas River, to the City
Park in Little Rock was marked by
enthusiastic demonstrations of -wel
come on tho part of thousands of peo
ple appearing on the streets for the
occasion. While in Little Rock the
President delivered two speeches, in
one of which he denounced lynching,
and in doing so elicited hearty ap
plause.
After inspecting Fort Logan H.
Root, whence the party was escorted
from tbe SDecial train, the President
and hla traveling companions were
taken in carriages through the city of
Argentina, where he was liberally
along the route. Crossing the
river, the party proceeded through the
fceart of Little Rock on Main street.
The President, standing in his carriage,
was kept busy acknowledging the cor
Â£ial greetings from the great throng
. ef poopl*.
At the City Park the crowd that
â¢ rathered to participafe In the formal
\u25a0welcome was conservatively estimated
at 40.000.
After the exercises and the Presi
dent's address the party was taken to
the" Albert Scott Pike Scottish Rite
Consistory, where a luncheon was
served. This function was concluded at
8:30 p. m., and the visitors then re
paired to the special train in waiting
at the Rock Island station to, convey
the party to Memphis.
Governor John F. Davis wan the first
to greet the President when the latter
left the train at the foot of Big Rock.
A reception committee, which included
United States Senators James H. Berry
end James P. Clarke, Mayor \V. E.
Lenou and twenty other prominent
citizens, united with the Governor in
\u25a0welcoming the chief executive and his
party. Carriages were then taken and
â¢within fifteen minutes Fort Logan H.
Root was reached. Here a salute of
' twenty-one guns was fired, and the
president, after inspecting the build
ings and grounds and the garrison,
epent half an hour in the oflicers' quar
ters as the guest of Lieutenant Colonel
C. A. Sharpe, commandant of the post.
GUESTING FOR VETERAXS.
An impressive incident followed the
f resident's exit from the officers' quar
rs. The g-uard of honor, composed of
twelve Union army veterans, headed by
Colonel A. J3. Fowler, and twelve for
mer Confederates, headed by former
Governor Daniel W. Jones, had met the
Presidential party and accompanied it
to the army post. They rode in pairs,
each former Confederate by the side of
a Federal army veteran. As the Presi
dent was being escorted to his carriage
for tbe journey from Fort Logan H.
Root to the city he v left those accom
panying him and walked to where the
guard of honor stood. Each of the
soldiers was given a hand clasp and a
verbal greeting by the President, who
had remarked on approaching the
group, "Gentlemen, it does me good to
see the blue and the gray riding to
gether." He called each veteran "com
rade."
â¢As the party entered the City Park
of Little Rock under an arch bearing
tbe inscription, "Little Rock Greets
You," twelve white doves were liber
ated in the apex of the arch, directly
over the President's carriage. This
feature caused great cheering and the
President smiled his approval.
The exercises at the City Park opened
promptly at 11:30 a. m. Governor Davis
delivered an address of welcome, in
â¢which he drew a word picture of the
resources of Arkansas, touching lightly
upon the race question, and assured the
President the people of Arkansas were
glad he had come among them. The
Governors tribute to Southern women
yas applauded by the President. When
was made by Governor Davis
to the famous "rebel yell" the proceed
ings were interrupted by a manifest
desire on the part of many in the crowd
to give a semblance of this yell. The
President seemed pleased with the ef
fort.
LYXCHIXG DENOUNCED.
The President's opening words, "Fel
low Americans." produced a renewal of
the demonstration of welcome. His ut
terances were followed closely by the
large audience and at intervals he had
to desist while his hearers grave vent
to their approbation of his remarks.
TVhen he declared that the menace and
reproach of lynch law should be driven
out of the United States there was
much earnest cheering. A large por
tion of the President's audience was
compoied of negroes and the chief
executive's words pertaining to lynch
ing were apparently deeply appreciated.
The President's declaration that "If a
President Is worth hfs salt, he's the
President of the whole country," was
given so earnestly that It speedily drew
forth plaudits from the assembled
thousands. The President added:
The worst enemy of the negro race is tht
Mgro criminal, and above all the criminal oi
the hideous type, so often hideously avencea.
Everj' reputable colored man owes the duty
to himself and to his rare to hunt down that
criminal. Now. aÂ« to the white man's Fide.
Kow to avenge" one hideous crime by another
in to' reduce the avenper to the bestial level.
Another thing which makes thin lynch la*
*o abhorrent is that three-fourths of the crtn-.es
fir which it is invoked are for others than
\u25a0'\u25a0/a.t against the vromf-n of the country. Gov
\u2666rror. you and I and all others In authority
owe it to our people to drive out the reDroach
en<i menace of lynch law In the United States.
The exercises in the City Park were
brought to a close at 12:30 p. m. and the
Presidential party was . then escorted
through the Ftreets, densely packed with
cheering men, women and children, to
the Albert Pike Consistory, where the
luncheon was given. One hundred repre
sentative, men of . the- State sat at the
tables, and several hundred others oc
cupied balcony seats overlooking the
tcene. At the President's right sat John
P. Lee. United States Senators Berry
and Clarke and General Powell Clayton,
former United States Embassador to
Mexico, were among those occupying
eeats of honor.

President Rogers of. the Board of Trade,
to deliver .the opening address on "The
President of the United States." In his
address . Judge Rose said that the Presi
dent had proved himself the President
of no political party, .but the President
of every man, woman and child under
the protection of the American flag. The
President â¢ himself led in . the applause
which greeted the remark.: The Presi
dent was given a great ovation as he rose
to respond. He spoke briefly.
In referring to the "abuses in con
nection with our whple system of
laws," he said:
Ko greater ftervloe - 1* being . rendered the
public to-day than . by those members of tbe
law profession whose good tortuxe it has been
to stand forts as prominently Identified with
the prosecution of crimes aeain&t tbe state.
Wnen I cay crime* acainst the state I not
only refers to crimes like tnose of bribery and
corruption \u25a0 committed by any publlo oiflcial,
but 1 mean such - a crime as murder or any
similar misdeed where tbe offense is not merely
against the Individual - but against the whou
community. It la rig-ht to remember theÂ«Â»
interests of the Individual but It la right a.su
to remember the interests of that gieat mats
of Individuals embodied in the public In the
Government. â¢ â¢ â¢ \u25a0\u25a0 \u25a0
It is unfortunate that we have permitted
practices that were necessary three hundred
years ago to be perverted so that they become
a means for allowing criminals to escape the
punishment of their criminality. We urgently
need in this country methods for expediting
punishment j methods lor doing, away with
delay, methods which will secure to the pubi;Â»
an even chance with the criminal â I do noi
ask for any more.
At present the right of appeal Is in certain
cases 60 abused 'as to make, it a matter of
the utmost difficulty ultimately to punish a
man sufficiently rich or sufficiently Influential
to command really good legal 'talent. Now X
em speaking of what I know, for I am speak
ing In the light of experience during the past
three years In trying to get at certain public
offenders who have been Indicted, and somt
of them It has been almost impossible to get
Into the jurisdiction of the courts at "Wash
ington in order to try them. There are others
whose cases are still on trial.
- 1 feel that the man . who offends against
the state occupies a position rather worse
than that of any other criminal, from thf
fact that he is \u25a0 a man who attacks every
body instead of Just one person; so that It 1&
not the special business of any one to get at
him. In consequence If he can keep the force
of justice at bay lone enough â if he can secure
one or two mistrials gradually the poputai
interest evaporates and the criminal gets off.
The minute that a man becomes President
he ! ceases t being - President of a - party and is
the President of every man. woman and child
within the confines of the nation. - But I per
mit myself one particular bit of personal dls*
crimination. I am Just & trifle more lntenv
on -punishing the -Republican offender than thi
Democratic offender, because he is my own
scoundrel. â¢ . â¢: .
As the President sat down the curtain
back of where he was stationed ascended
and a tableau was presented. Twenty
five boys, rang;injs-in age from 8 to 12,
each attired in a sailor suit, formed a
group at once attractive and Impressive."
The spectacle won the President's heart
and he gave unmistakable signs of his
pleasure. He arose and said that he
gruessed all his auditors knew how he felt
about the navy of the United States.
The navy of our country, ' he said, was
the United States' "big stick" which
would never be used against the weak
unless the wÂ«ek put themselves in a po
sition, when, like a. bad child, chastise
ment was necessary,: He , added that the
"big stick" would be kept, in such condi
tion that the necessity for its use against
the strong would never, arise.
At 3:30 p. m. the Presidential party be
gan the trip to the Rock Island Railroad
station along a route which was lined
with people. The special train left for
Memphis promptly at 4 o'clock.
BRIEF SPEECH AT MEMPHIS.
MEMPHIS, Term., Oct. 25.â President
Roosevelt and his party arrived here to
night at 8:30. The President's itinerary
did not include a stop here longer than
was necessary to switch his cars to the
Illinois Central, the original programme
being that he would proceed at once to
New Orleans. These plans were some
what modified when a large crowd of
citizens appeared at the Calhoun-street
depot and loudly cheered the President
and called upon him for a speech. The
President acknowledged these greetings
and proceeded to a hastily improvised
stand from which he made a short ad
dress, dwelling upon what constitutes good
citizenship. Several, members of the
President's party left the train here and
departed for Washington. The President,
Secretary Loeb, Surgeon General Rixey
and John A. Mcllhenny left for New Or
leans over the Illinois Central at 8:50
o'clock. X
An unexpected greeting to the President
was the' firing of a Presidential salute by
General PetÂ«r Tracey, who upon the oc
casion of the President's former, visit to
Memphis received him at the station with
a salute of twenty-one guns'.
The trip from Little Rock to Memphis
was uneventful. The President enter
tained the departing newspapermen at
dinner in his private car and bade them
a cordial good-by.

to Investigate Methods
of the Company's Officials
NEW YORK, Oct. 25.â More. startling
than the testimony before the legisla
tive committee Investigating thÂ« : meth
ods of Insurance companies to-day was
the announcement by President Rich
ard A. McCurdy of the Mutual Life In
surance Company ' that , a committee of
the board of trustees of his company
had been appointed to investigate the
company and its methods.
The members of the committee are:
William H. Truesdale, Effingham E.
Morris and John W. Auchincloss, all
prominent In the financial and busi
ness world.-
This action was taken at a- meeting
of the .board to-day and was the re
sult of the insurance Investigation. The
matter was brought beforo -.tho board
by President McCurdy, and the com
mittee will begin Its work at once.
Still another interesting feature of
the Insurance situation was tho state
ment Issued to-day by President Mor
ton of the Equitable Life, showing
that thÂ« receipts^ of. that company for
the nine months of this year exceed the
expenditures by $16,"723,197, an in
crease of more than 9600,000, compared
with the same period last year. Re
ceipts from premiums on policies for
the third quarter of this year were
more than $1,000,000 less than In 1904.
The expense of the third quarter, was
$839,913 less than last: year, but for
the first six months there was an la
crease over last year of $424,943.
After an entire 'day given over to the
examination of Emory McClintock, ac
tuary of- the Mutual Life Insurano*
Company, and to the reading of col
umn after column of figures/ the legis
lative committee adjourned until No
vember 8, the day after the municipal
election. This extended adjournment
was taken to enable the members of
the committee who are candidates for
re-election to the Assembly to meet
their constituents and conduct their
campaigns.
The testimony of McClintock was of
a technical nature. A number/ of his
explanations brdughtout the fact that
his ideas were in many respects at va
riance with the established methods of
insurance companies, and that of his
own company in particular. '*n^;\>>

Missouri Official Confers With Xeir
York Lite's Attorneys.
JEFFERSON CITY. Mo.. Oct. 25.â
The conference set for to-day between
Attorneys F. N. Judson and E. C. Crow,
representing the New York Life Insur
ance Company, and State Superintend
ent of Insurance W. D. Vandiver. con
cerning probable action to be taken by
Superintendent Vandiver toward an
nulling the State license of the insur
ance company, was held to-day.
The proceedings were opened by Van
diver reading 'his letter to President
McCall of the New York Life Insurance
Company,' when he demanded "that- the,
contributions' to* the national^ Repub-"
llcan campaign funds be returned ~ and
the president' and 'vice president re
sign, or that assurance be given by
the board of directors that the alleged
misappropriated moneys would be re
turned within thirty days. He also
read a letter from President McCall,
stating that Attorney Judson had full
power/ to represent him In this matter.
Judson began his argument by read
ing the statute under which Vandiver
proposed to act. He held that , the
State sup'rmtendent of Insurance/had
no power under the statute, except
upon the ground that the company was
insolvent or that its capital fund -had
been impaired, substantiating his argu
ment by quoting decisions of the courts
of this and other States.
Further, Judson said,- the demands
made by Vandlver could not be com
piled with. - - f ;
"These demands are Impossible," he
said, "because the superintendent asks
that the officers refiihd- the money
($148,000) contributed to the Repub
lican fund within thirty days."
Judson contended that the directors
and the policy holders were not respon
sible and that the officers could not be
made to pay, and that if they, did pay
the money, according to Vandlver's letter,
they would then be compelled "to resign,
which he was sure they would not do If
they had. paid back the money.
Superintendent Vandiver, \u25a0In his reply,
asked for a definition of "solvency" and
Judson informed him that it meant abili
ty to pay death claims,;; endowments
and matured obligations., [
Vandiver asked if the attorneys consid
ered the New York Life, under present
conditions, as being a safe investment for
policy holders and Judson said r , that ; he
did. Vandiver then made inquiry regard
ing the reasonable return \ on ; an \u25a0 invest
ment in the company, and was told \u25a0 that
the dividends were not as ] large ; as ? for
merly, because money rates were ( easier.
. The political contribution was taken up
again and Judson suggested that another
company had contributed : to the cam
paign fund and that no action had 'been
taken against It,, and that : he believed
that other corporations had contributed
to both the Democratic and Republican
parties.
Vandiver wanted his proof for this as
sertion. Judson said that he did not have
It, but that It was his opinion. .; ;,
Vandiver contended that, the ; directors
â¢were liable for the money misappropri
ated by the officers. He, said* that this
contribution came under .the head of em
bezzlement and that the directors, if they
knew of it, were also/ ; in i his
criminally liable, and ;if they >', did not
know it; they were guilty of gross neglect
of duty.
"They-^should be : removed ; from office,"
said Vandlver, "and hence :; the ; actlonH
have marked out would : protect' ali, ; by
causing the policy holders 'to remove -such
directors." I \u25a0 '.-'"'
Vandiver concluded \u25a0; by stating that ' he
had received % hundreds - letters ; from
policy' holders and h that"; 9s Â». per." cent t of
them favored _* his ;{ proposed ':\u25a0 policy,'; " but
that ; he would " take no * action -;until -the

JOHN S. PARTRIDGE.
WHEN Mr.. Partridge was nominated for Mayor ;he was
known only to such of our. citizens as /had contact with
him socially and officially. To newspaper readers he was
known through his highly expert conduct of the case of the Spring
Valley Water Company before the Federal Court Commissioner,
where he appeared for the city. In that case it was shown that
he. is a lawyer of fine training, possessed of a ; legal mind and
knowledge of a high order. The 'quality he had shown to those
who knew him, the highly creditable incidents of his career from
'.Mvyhood up. his power of statement and preference for the best in
life and government, caused those who knew >iim to urge his nom
ination. Their urging was successful. He was nominated and
immediately became known to the whole city.
Men have studied him in his public appearances and utterances
and find him courageous, sincere, frank and etean. /The personal
attacks made upon him have only reacted, to the injury of their
authors. .People believe he can be depended upon for a square deal
in municipal politics, and he has shown the force and independence
needed to put our local government on a high plane and keep it
there until the people, accustomed to the best, will not permit a
lapse to the worst. We believe that he has convinced many voters
in the ranks of labor that they.are being used by the politicians who
work the workingman. The approbation with which he meets in
the labor districts bears every evidence of spontaneity.
Two years ago Mr. Ruef played a slick game slickly. â¢ He
crowded Mr. Lane's meetings with his followers instructed to feign
an enthusiasm for the Democratic candidate which would - make
Republicans believe him stronger than Mr.* Crocker, and therefore
the more likely to beat Schmitz. This game aided in diverting
votes and dividing the opposition more evenly, so that Schmitz
slipped in as a minority candidate, but by a plurality of votes. /
The fusion committee has been on guard against a repetition
of these characteristic Ruef tactics, which might now be used to
give the fusion forces and managers a false confidence, resulting
in relaxation of their efforts. The closest investigation indicates
that the support of Mr. Partridge in the labor districts is real and
not feigned, and that there, as elsewhere in the city, he is accepted
as a courageous leader, of great ability and capable of most credit
ably representing San Francisco as its executive. He will have the
appointment of the great governing boards of the city provided for
by the charter.
The people wish those boards so constituted that a citizen
having business there may approach them directly, state his case
and get his rights under the law. They do not wish, to have to
seek audience with some intermediary, either in a swipe shop or
a political lawyer's office, who for a fee will get from the board
concerned the rights that belong to a citizen without feeing any
body. One crying evil of the present administration is that a citizen
cannot do business directJy with any of its public instruments. . He
must "see" somebody, pay a fee or promise a political service before
he can get his legal right.
When the administration is beaten and Mr. Partridge is Mayor
the enforced confidences of men will no longer bind them, and
we will get the truth about present conditions. Now it is known
that one man paid a fee of $500, another of $1000 and others sums
greater or less to an "attorney" for decisions or action of the vari
ous boards. The attorney makes no public appearance befor.e the
board concerned. He presents no brief. He introduces no evi
dence. He simply issues an order for the thing to be done, and it
is done. These things will cease when Mr. Partridge is Mayor.
Every citizen will approach the governing boards and get his rights
on hi^own motion and without the payment of a fee.
The city knows John S. Partridge now and likes him. His
speeches have supplied the war cries of the campaign. The tooth
of slander has been broken off trying to gnaw away his reputation.
He has fearlessly met every issue. There is not a suspicion of
demagog}' about him. He means what he says, aiid says it so well
that his campaign has taken on an intellectual tone and a hold
upon human interest that cannot be broken. Like a true leader,
he is largely his own platform. He stands for what the people
demand first, a decent~anti-graft administration, a square deal, law
and order, peace and prosperity.
He resents the statement of Mayor Schmitz that his re-election
is necessary in order to restrain laboring men from war and dis
order in the streets. Laboring men have as much respect for law
and order as anybody else. They are as law-abiding as any and
do not require a, grafting city administration to hold them in re
straint Mayor Schmitz has belched this charge against working
men all over the city, claiming that he is their master and no other,
and that they require a keeper as if. they were wild animals and he
the only one that can enter their cage and put them through their
tricks. N L \ \u0084./_
Mr. Partridge believes them perfectly capable of maintaining
order and as respectful of the law. as, anybody else, for. they help
make it, and by their votes aid in constituting the public authority
to enforce it. Mr. Partridge does not believe that any body of our
citizens requires to be held in leash by a Mayor. Their respect for
the law keeps them watchful of their own rights and regardful oi
the rights of others, . :': '- y-.:Zy -.:Z ;
AS TO COLLINS.
T UGGLING with technicalities is one of the* forms of criminal
I trickery most dangerous to society and it should be made one
of the most dangerous to the juggler. The evidence seems to
be cumulating that the extradited Collins is so expert in that line
he is entitled to be considered an arch pervert of legal talent, and
if he is fully shown to be guilty the opportunity of punishing him
severely for his offense will be also a specially good one -to con
demn the form of criminality of which he seems so superlatively a
practitioner.
When a man by an almost interminable, series of objections,
tricky flights and many ways of playing with and defying justice
causes the people so much expense in trying him that some ,were
in favor of letting the trickster escape rather than spend more in
his punishment he becomes doubly the menace to society his
crimes would make him unaided by perfection in the art of
scheming with technicalities.
<f There is a clear example of duplicity in the excuse given by
Collins that when he fled to Canada he was not a fugitive , from
justice, but just bent on taking his wife for a trip to benefit her
health by change of climate. That has the sound of a joke irrev
erent to justice just on the face of it; but when we compare it with
the statement of Detective Gibson that when Collins stole away
into Canada he announced to the Britishers he had come under UiV
protection of their flag to get justice the duplicity of the man is
seen to be glaring. Besides that, consider the insult to the flag
of his own country there was in that nauseating, tricky appeal to
the protection of- an alien Government.- - â¢
He won the applause of the Canadian crowd when he made
that renegade announcement and, now .that he is ignominiously
brought back, no less dramatic and hearty should be the hiss'which
greets his statement made on arriving in San Francisco. that he, still
â¢has some "patriotism" left. Seldom does there happen a more de-.
testable example of the double offense of .adding insult to injury. .
It is proposed to send Mr. Cleveland at the head of "the American
delegation to The Hague. He is believed to know even more big words
than are .contained in the Dutch language! â Philadelphia Inquirer

DEEDS AND INTENTIONS.
JOHN J. HOLDEN
MAN is Judged by his deeds in this
world; by his intentions in thÂ«
nextâ and the proverb tells us of
the use to which good intentions are put
in the heated hereafter.
It is one of the vices of family life and
of sympathetic womanhood generally that
both assume intentions to be the stand
ard in this world as well. At the moment
when' every effort should be made to ln
culcatt- in the growing child a sense of
responsibility, as a basis of character the
non-performance of some duty or the
commission of some fault is palliated by
the statement, "He m<?ant to do right."
: Generosity .and sympathy are fine
things: but juatlce is something finer.
.. The world, without the home, is, taken
as a whole, a pretty Just one.*- It. too, can
make excuses if they are n%^essary. but
it dislikes to. In the long ,run humanity
has discovered for itself that the person
who has to have excuses made for him
Is not the sort of man that succeeds In
the struggle for life. In character he Is
a cripple 7 . ; in the world's estimation, .and

his Bister, laughing at his failure. "I can
do that just as well as my brother," he
said in protest. "But your brother does
it," she replied, and there was no further
argument. The excuse maker borrowed
a light from the doer of deeds.
The years have proved the earlier fact;
the elder boy is a success in the game of

WITH HIS PRETTY JAPANESE WIFE.
Seafaring Man- Settles Difficulties With American Spouse and
Is to Make Home in Mikado V Realm.
I MRS. BERTHA JANE GOIXG. WIFE OF MASTER OF STEAMSHIP AMERICA MARU, WHOSE SUIT FOR DIVORCE -WILL -
NOT BE RESISTED BY HER HUSBAND. AN AGREEMENT WAS ANNOUNCED TESTERDAY WHEREBY THE DE
[ FENDANT IS TO ALLOW JUDGMENT BY DEFAULT. \u25a0 .;
When Philip Hastings Going, master
of the Toyo Kisen Kaisha liner America
ilaru, returns #o the land of the Rising
Sun it will be to settle down with the
pretty Japanese woman that bears his
name, free from the entanglements of the
alliance with the woman of his own
blood who, under the law of California,
is his only legal spouse. It was an
nounced in Judge Murasky's court yes
terday that Captain Going and Mrs.
Bertha Jane Going, who recently sued
him for divorce, have settled their prop
erty rights out of court and that the
gallant mariner will make no contest to
the action instituted by his wife for ab
solute separation, but will permit It to
go by default.
An order directing Captain Going to ap
pear before Judge Murasky to show cause
why the Injunction heretofore entered
against him. restraining him from dis
posing of his property In Tehama County
and from collecting the salary due him
from the steamship company, pending the
final adjudication of Mrs. Going's suit
for divorce, was on the calendar for
hearing yesterday morning. When the
case was called, however. Attorney Ray
P. Saffold. who represents Mrs. Going,
asked that the order to show cause be
discharged and the restraining order dis
missed. The parties had come to an
agreement regarding their property
rights, he said, and the purpose of the
writ had b^en accomplished. His mo
tion was granted.
Mrs. Going did not care to go into de-

GAS FROM PASTE.
When Used as Food Is Bound to Make
Trouble.
The average cereal food, as fre-
quently prepared, forms a pasty, gas-
generating mass in the stomacn, which
gives the digestive apparatus consider-
able trouble and frequently puts it out
of business. A young man writes from
Trenton. N. J., to tell what It did for
him:
"I livedi n a boarding-house for three
years before I was married," he says,
"and every blessed morning there was
supplied me some sort of cereal break-
fast food, which I ate simply because I
had been trained to eat what was set
before me â not because I particularly
relished any of it. It used to lie heavy
on my stomach and within an hour fill
me full of gas. making me very un-
comfortable. At last this sort of thing
brought on a serious disturbance of my
digestive apparatus, with loss of appe-
tite, and in time I had to go under the
doctor's care.
"He put me on a diet of milk and
toast, which In a week or two lost me
thirteen pounds in weight. I had a
package of Grape-Nuts food inmy room,
which I had bought as a matter of
curiosity, but had never opened. When
I finally tired of milk and toast I
thought I would try the Grape-Nuts,
without any expectation that I would
like it, thinking that it was. probably
similar to all the rest of the prepared
foods.
. "I liked it with cream from the start,
however, finding It entirely different
from anything else that I had ever
eaten, and Indulged in it freely. In one
week (I say it on my honor) I regained
nine pounds in weight and the Grape- 1
Nuts gave me the power to digest other
kinds of food. It put me on my feet
In a few days and now is and .always
will be a regular food Item in our
house. My only trouble is to keep my
wife from eating too much of it, she
likes it so well." Name given by Pos-
tum Co.. Battle Creek, Mich.
There's a reason-

tails as to the nature of the settlement
reached between her and her husband.
"I am anxious that nothing should be
said or done that would injure Captain
Going's standing with the steamship com
pany by which he is employed." she said,
"and do not carÂ© to discuss the caso
In detail until after next Friday, when
the final agreement will have been
reached. Too much publicity, ofttimes
leads to misunderstandings on the part
of outsiders. However, we have about com
pleted our negotiations for an agreement
and within ten days my suit for divorce
will be heard and I have no doubt th.at
the court will grant me a decree on the
showing I will be able to make."
Edward Jones, manager of the San
Francisco Riding Club at Seventh avenue
and C street, was granted a divorce yes
terday from Elaine Jones, whom he mar
ried at Racine, Wis,, in 1594. Jones
proved his allegation that his wife de
serted him more than a year ago, re
fusing to come with him to California
when he was offered the position he now
holds. The decree was issued by Superior
Judge Graham.
Decrees of divorce were also Issued to
John E. from Mary F. Wilcox for de

MINERS ADOPT
A NEW METHOD
State Association ', Decides
to Meet Hereafter Where
I the Mines i Are J Located
CONVENTION IS GALLED
Sessions of 1905;iWill Be
Held at Nevada v City in
the Month of November
The California Miners' Association has
determined upon a new course of-actlon.
President Benjamin said, yesterday that
Instead of holding all the conventions In
San Francisco, as heretofore, it has ap
peared advisable. " to ; the executive' com
mittee of the aÃsoclatlon, to meet in the
mining sections of the State.
The â¢ association \ came :lnto , existence
when It was desired by the miners to re
habilitate hydraulic â¢ mining.' ' Placer,
Sierra, Amador, Nevada,! Yuba, Tuolumne
and other mining jcounties rallied .with
financial and moral support and the
movement that, resulted , enabled the
association to.get;the Caminettl law
passed. It also enabled the association
to- secure large appropriations from trie
National Government and from the State
of California to have dams established
on the Yuba River to restrain mining
debris/ . ..: '' '-. :;-iUÂ»'. !> '; . ..-â¢ ; .;. ' .'.:, ,
The Caminetti act helped smaller opera
tors by the hydraulic process in certain
localities, but never enabled the larger
hydraulic mining enterprises to resume.
When it became apparent in the mining
counties where 2 hydraulic ; mining and
proved to be very profitable .to .lndivid-,
uals and sources of county wealth, the
Caminetti act, which was accepted as a
compromise in the. first Instance, dldi not
work to full satisfaction, the financial
support that certain mining counties had
given dropped off and the principal source
of support came from San Francisco. \ In
course of time miners spoke unfavorably
of this. \ . i
To regain favor by showing the mining
counties that jan organization is for j tha
benefit of ! the mining industry, of the
entire State it has been voted by the
Calif oiyiia Miners' Association Sto hold
conventions at various points. The an
nual convention of 1905 will be -held at
Nevada' City November 22, 23, 24 and2s.
Committees of the California Miners' As
sociation have been appointed at Ne
vada City and at Grass Valley to co
operate with the local committee to
make the convention as much of a suc
cess as possible. Fred Searles, W. F.
Englebright and Nat jP. Brown are ap
pointed by the association for the' Ne
vada City committee and George Main
hart, A. D. Foote and C. G. Church will
serve as committeemen at Grass Valley.

My Dear Kittens: You will be interested, I think, if not altogether pleased, at

Special Dispatch to Tfc* Call.
BAXTA BARBAHA, Oct. 2B. â The
Banta Barbara County Polo Club ex
pect* to hold a championship polo
tournament come time during January,
\u25a0which promise" to be the largest and
most Important affair of the kind ever
fcftld on the Pacific Coant. Already the
officers of the local club are making
arrangements for the transportation of
players and ponies, and the Santa Bar
bara field Is being put In the best pos
sible condition. Local players are
practicing regularly, and in all proba
bility Banta Barbara will enter two
teams.
Last year when F. J. Mackay, the
wrll-known English polo player, was
In California, he visited Santa Barbara
and played on the local grounds. At
that time he expressed a wish to spend
tome time here during the 1906 sea
fcon. stating that the heavy rainfall
during the winter and early spring In
the northern ond of the State greatly
Interfered with polo at Burllngame.
Mackay expect* to bring a crack Eng
lish ' team out this winter, and will
jirobably make Santa Barbara his head
auarters.
Ix>B Ansreles and Riverside have
promised to send teams to take part in
t January tournament, and with
>lackay'Â« team and the local teams in
the Held, polo enthusiasts here expect
tliat the Burlinsame team and the team
of the Fourteenth Cavalry will enter,
â¢o that the tournament may be a rep
resentative one.
'A tournament in which all these
teams competed would settle beyond
question t lie State championship for
the season. Santa Barbara has the
championship team of the south, hav
ing defeated Los Angeles In the finals
of the tournament held here last Au
guÂ»t. The Santa Barbara team also
lowered the colors of the Burllngame
four on the last occasion when these
clubs came together, in July, 1904.

KAUFMANN HAS MANY ADMIRERS
RULES A STRONG FAVORITE
Much 'Interest? Displayed in Battle
Interest In the Kaufmann-O'Brlen
fight, which will be'; pulled off at
Woodward's Pavilion to-morrow night
before the San Francisco Club, Is now
at Its height, the bout having awak
ened more enthusiasm, than any^ en
counter of its kind planned in this
city, for a long . time. Heavy-weight
bouts have been a scarcity In this part
of the world, and the match made by
Alec Gregcains will come in the nature
of a treat to the local fight fans. Proof
of this fact la evident by the way seats
for the- contest "are " selling. The old
pavilion on Valencia street, is sure to
be filled to Its. utmost capacity when
the two big. fellows step into the ring
to slip on the mitts.
Kaufmann's work â¢at his \u25a0 Alameda
training quarters was considerably cut
down yesterday.' The youngster could
not possibly, be, in better . trim . than
that In which- the veteran trainer, Billy
Delancy, finds him. and if his present
condition Is taken Into account he will
enter the ring fit and ready.
Instead of covering the nine miles of
road work, as was his dally custom
since he began training for his bout
with Kaufmann, O'Brlpn cut the dis
tance In half, but went over, the
ground with his usual burst of speed.
The Phlladelphlan was again accompa
nied by his sprinter training partner,
Frledlander, who was again outdis
tanced by the fighter. The afternoon's
work was the same as usual, but box
ing was eliminated from the pro
gramme." -
O'Brien, who has trained himself,
thinks he is ready for a grueling flght
and In condition' to take the punches of
his hard-hitting: adversary. The East
ern tighter has spared no efforts Ato
round Into the best of fix, knowing
that by winning from Kaufmann he can
reap a golden. harvest in future bouts.
The. betting" at Corbett's last night
was 10 to 7, with Kaufmann favorite,
and there was no O'Brien money to be
had at that price. It appears as
though the local patrons of the fight
ing game inject too much sentiment
into their Judgment. O'Brien's record,
which inclades nearly 200 ring engage
ments, would make it seem that , he
should be on the flrst choice of the
odds Instead of his inexperienced oppo
nent.
The sale of seats Is going on mer
rily and a great house is predicted.The
one. clause in the articles which,,, pre
cludes the club from issuing compli
mentary tickets to any one save mem
bers of the local press makes it possible
for v more substantial gate.
Jack Welch, who will referee the con
test, will visit the boxers to-day to
talk over the rules under which they
have agreed to box. . ,

The fighting last night at the Olympic
Club was the kind that satisfies the most
ardent crank.: The contestants were well
matched and hard flghts resulted. Willie
Wolff, ' a welterweight from the Ariel
Rowing Club, defeated Al Lloyds In a
bout which kept the crowd yelling
throughout. There was not a moment of
tame fighting. Wolff, with a series of
rights and lefts to the head in the third
round, had his opponent In bad shape and
Referee Graney 'stopped the fight and
awarded the Ariel Club boy the palm. ,
Prank Flores, after defeating Edward
Ryan.' in the early part of the evening

GAMES - TO-DAY.

Seattle at Los Angeles.
If 'the Giants; continue to play ball
like they .did .yesterday, against the
Seals it will about'diive the fans away
from the park for keeps. Besides boot
ing .the ball around the lot and letting
seven runs through. y\ the men from
Portland began to roast. the umpire till
McLean was chased and Atz received a
calling.
Laiitu^. ' - â¢....\u25a0 / ' I \u25a0
To add to the sorrowful aspect of the
l proceedings^ Pitcher Bill Essick re
ceived a'split flnger in the fifth inning,
when he', tried <to I stop a hot grounder
from Householder's bat. He had to quit
the game," and Califf, a young busher
from northern climes,, came in and dia
pretty fair work, though he received
wretched support. . Â£j vV,
Up to the fifth inning! the. game 'was
a fairly creditable exhibition. The Seals
were leading then, 1 to 0, .when House
holder 'smashed the torrid one -at Es-,
sick. The ball got away from him after
he split his finger and it also eluded
the mitts of Schlafley. Thi3 was the
beginning of the disaster, for the Giant
i second baseman began to boot the ball
some more and the Seals 1 quickly ac
quired three additional runs.
Then McLean began to get sassy be
cause .he struck- out and went up to
roast Umpire Davis. The indicator man
stood pat and called the big fellow be
fore the crowd. McLean w*as chased
from the field and Suess, another north
ern bush leaguer, grabbed the mitt and
mask and played ! the game out behind
the bat.
Schlafley was the; worst on the field,
making as many .'as four errors, three
of which figured in the run column. Atz
and Mitchell were also. there In the bad
work line, each contributing two mli^
plays. . The rest of the team did : hbt
get many chances, or "they, too, might
have been auite'as;bad. .
Hltt was in the real form and fanned
ten men. The best the Giants got was
three hits. Two of these in the seventh
gave them their -only run. . Mitchell
singled and Mohler.'s failure to cover
thebag on Householder's return; throw
let .him - take second." - Schlafley'' then
swung through to right; field fence
with a double that'vbrought the run. *:

Jockey. ; Club, announced yesterday that
Ingleside would be "thrown open on De

becontlnued until January "20, 1906, when
the return , to Oakland will be ; made. The

drivers !\u25a0 arid >' livery \u25a0' proprietors. :
.C. H.VPettingill, a steward ~6f the
jockey ""' club arid; associate judge at Oakt

York yesterday that Tommy Griffin had
made ; liberal entries ! In ; the stake events
here and would ship a stable of fifteen

FERRY STEAMER OAKLAND.
Collision Occurs Du
ring a Heavy \
Fog.
Passengers Make a
Rush for Life
Preservers.
Thick Weather Par
alyzes All Bay
Traffic.
The steam schooner Phoenix ran into
the Southern Pacific Company's ferry
steamer Oakland yesterday morning
during a heavy fog. Panic seized the
Oakland's passengers, who rushed for
the life preservers and prepared to face
the worst. Captain Anderson of the
ferry steamer and his crew soon calm
ed the excited people and the Oakland
later reached the mole with all on
board alive and uninjured.
The Oakland was on her 9:20 a. m.
trip from this side and fortunately was
not particularly crowded with passen
gers, the tide of travel at that time of
day being mostly in the other direction.
The Phoenix. Captain Hendrickseri in
command, left the Oakland long wharf
shortly after 9 o'clock for Jackson
street wharf and apparently soon got
lost in the fog, for she was far out of
her course when she ran into the Oak
land.
The collision occurred after the Oak
.and had passed Goat Island. Captain
Anderson heard the Phoenix whistling
und. being unable exactly to locate the
sound, brought his vessel to a stand
still. When the collision occurred, says
Captain Anderson, the Oakland had no
headway. The Phoenix came out of
the, fog with a sudden rush and struck
the Oakland on the starboard side. Just
forward of the paddle box. The peo
plÂ« on the Oakland declare that the
Phoenix appeared to be going at full
speed and the hole in the Oakland's
hull iv a measure confirms their opin
ion. '*v â
According: to Captain Hendrieksen.
however. thÂ« Phoenix was going full
speed astern at the time of the collis
ion. What really did happen will not
be known until the United States in
spectors finish their investigation and
place the responsibility.
After the collision the Phoenix 1 ' dis
appeared in the tog. The Oakland pro
ceeded to the mole under her own
'power, landed her passengers and was
turned over to a repair gang. The
Piedmont was put on the run in her
I'lace. â¢
The" fog paralysed traffic on the bay
until nearly noon and there were many
narrow escapes. As usual, the ferry
steamer Berkeley, probably the most
unmanageable of bay craft, figured In
many of the complications. She nearly
cut down the steamer Newark on one
trip and on another narrowly escaped
collision with the Key Route steamer
Sun Jose. - ,
" The 'Cazadero stopped on one trip
from 'Rausaliio ;ust in time to save her
self froru b*insj cut in two by a steam
schooner, which' went whizzing across
her bovrs hjp though there was no sucU
thing as a tos-
Several times during: the morning
ferry boats, steam schooners and other
craft bunched up In dangerous tangle
off the ferry slips, but except for the
mishap to the Oakland no serious ac
cidents were reported. â¢" â r

WHALER GAYHEAD
REACHES PORT
First of the Blubber Hunters
Comes Back From Ber
ing Sea With Small Catch
MYSTERIOUS LIGHT /SEEN
Captain Fisher Reports See
ing Strange Phosphoresr
cent Display at Sea
The whaling bark Gayhead, first of the
fleet to return from, this season's cruise,
arriveu late yesterday 'afternoon, after a
stormy : run home from - the Bering. Sea.
She met with poorv luck, but had to come]
home ; sooner than sne .otherwise would
on account of having sprung a leak.l I
On the night of. August 15, while the
Gayhead was sailing the Bering Sea un
der easy canvas,. 1 there' appeared on the
horizon what looked like a vast city
brilliantly illuminated with electric lights.
The glare; says Captain 'Fisher, was al
most dazzling. All hands were piped on
deck to see the ' r .-sigh~t, and 'although
among the crew were men who had made
many .voyages in many climes, not a
soul on board had ever seen the like be
fore. ' '
Captain' Fisher .feared that the phe'nSm-:
enon was caused by the sea breaking. on
a reef! and â¢ the vessel's course ' was
changed. It was changed several' times,'
but whichever, way she headed, \u25a0',- there, 1
over the forecastle ..ead, shone the myÃ4
terious. lights. Sailing later through the.
water where" the.- lights had appeared,'
vast quantities of jeuy-flsh were seen.
Captain Fisher reported what he had seen
to the revenue cutter people and the^tnat-^
ter has been reported by them to Wash
ington.
With the dawn of \u25a0 August 16 the dis
play gradually dimmed and disappeared
and nothing like it was seen again.
While off Kodiak the Gayhead was
nearly wrecked on a reef. There was no
wind. A strong current -was carrying the
bark: along at a rapid rate. Then came
the cry "Breakers ahead."
The five whaleboats were speedily
manned and launched and after hours of
hard rawing the bark was pulled out of
the influence of the current.
The last whale killed, while floundering
about in its dying agony, sent one of
the Gayhead's boats' flying into the air.
The boat was smashed, to smithereens,
but ail hands were picked up by the
other boats, none the worse for their
scare and ice-cold bath.
During a heavy gale encountered on the
homeward -run; two ,of the Gayhead|s
boats were washed out of the davits arid
swept overboard.
Only three whales were killed. Two
we.re . right whales and ' one . a sperm
whale. .The whales yielded 2100 pounds
of bone and 400 barrels of oil. *
. The green hands, , who went: -whaling to
make a fortune will get for their seven
months' hard work "'the sum of Jl each.
But they, had a long: ride.'
On August 20 the Alice Knowles was
sighted in -the Bering Sea, She had 600
barrels of oil and' 2000 pounds of bone.'
The other whalers will be due in a few
days... ' . - . ...
During the Gayhead's cruise, Joseph
Castro, a boat steerer, died of consump
tion. '- :;'V v*^.
LICK" AXI) I.OAVEL.L READY " -'
\: . , TO' BATTLE FOR HOXORS
Local Football Cfaamplonsblp Will Be
.""Settled To-Morrow Afternoon on - ;
Presidio" Grounds. \. "
The gatne which is to decide thej
championship of the local football sub
league will take place to-morrow after
noon- at" the Presidio athletic grounds!
when. Uck and Lowell line up. These
two schools have already played a
nothing to nothing game, and this one
should prove Jusi as close, although it
is rumored that the team from the Cal
ifornia School of Mechanical Arts will
have a little the' better of.it.,.
Since- their tie game with Lowell the
players from : the Potrero School have
practiced hard every day. Secret prac
tice, which was Installed by Captain
Main, proved successful from the start,
and'with'a few remarks from Lick's
former captain; Hotchkiss, a', better
aggregation has been developed. Sev
eral new, trick plays have been perfect
ed which are especially for Lowell's*
benefit, g
The'Lowell boys are just as confident
of winning as their rivals. Having
held their opponents to" a standstill
once, they think the charm will work
the second time, .with their colors wav
ing: on high. However, a little . more
serious practice wll have to be indulged
in /if they expect to keep pace with the
supporters of the black and gold.

ing Eunning of Street Cars
TEOY CEEATESrA SCENE
Committee^ Is -^'Agreed-.-Jhat
Outlying Sections of the
City Should --Be Built Up
The Supervisors" Street Committee yes
terday practically agreed to recommend
the. ordinance .submitted by the Mer
chants' Association and designed to limit
the speed of street cars to ten, twelve and
fifteen miles an hour in certain desig
nated' districts "with 'no" limit' in the out
lying section of the city. Chairman Con
nor stated the committee was ready to
report in favor of the ordinance, but de
sired to await_the presence of. Supervisor
Braunhart, who is ill.
pj M. King, secretary of the Merchants"
Association, urged the passage of the or
dinance on the ground that' rapid transit
was desired in the outlying districts to
cope with the trend "of tbe 'people to. take
up a residence . across the bay. M. Jor
dan of the ' Richmond District Club fa
vor^d'a. speedy service in order that the
outlying, districts may be reached rapidly.
\u25a0 \u25a0\u25a0â¢ E. ; P. Troy opposed the ordinance,
claiming: that the speed should be limited
all over the city in order to. prevent loss
of life through accidents, that the cars
should all be equipped with' air brakes
and that no car .should be permitted to
have a number of 'pasengers greater than
the seating capacity, plus one-half that
capacity for standing passengers.
Troy contended that the United Rail
roads was killing more people than any
other railroad, owing to the operation of
its cars at breakneck speed.
A. S. Llllie of the Mission Federated
Clubs wanted unlimited speed beyond
Thirtieth and Devisadero streets. He
pointed to the fact the ferries are carry
ing passengers ten miles in thirty-five
minutes and it took fifty minutes to go six
miles to the Cliff House.
Tirey L. Ford, attorney for the United
Railroads, said the.- proposed ordinance
fixed the speed at rates consistent with
safety and that. all cars now being pur
chased are being provided with air
brakes. i-'J-i;^"-'-"-
Troy began a long tirade." in which he
said the Supervisors would be. responsible
for any lives lost In the future, owing to
their not accepting an ordinance wnicb
he had submitted. Troy also accused the
committee of delaying action until alter
the election and waj creating his usual
scene when Chairman Connor ordered
him to desist. Troy persisted in being
heard and the sergeant at arms was
about to escort him out of the commit
tee-room when Connor . told Troy to sit
down, which he did and the incident was
ended. .. . â¢
The committee favored the amendment
of S. J. Theisen that the limit on Mission
street, between Eighteenth and Thirtieth,
be fixed at ten miles an. hour. Instead of
fifteen miles. " - , ;'-^,v Xt
The committee approved the map, show
ing land granted by the Pope Estate Com
pany for, the opening, of belvedere street
and the petition of the Merchants' As :
social. on that the names of streets, be im
bedded in the concrete sidewalks -at . In

next week there will be 500 people on
the stage. ; The extra horses are re
hearsed every morning and evening.
The company owns twenty horses, but
as they seldom use over twelve on the
road, the eight extra horses were sent
on here for a short vacation. In order
to keep them in tune with the perform
ance they are rehearsed every day Just
the same as the chorus.
The advance sale of the engagement
opens at the Grand Opera-house ticket
office this morning at 9 o'clock, and
judging from the great number of ad
vance orders already received the sale
will prove a record-breaker for San
Fancisco. >;â¢\u25a0-":"

STEAMEE GIPSY ADIED
AT A STBEBT SEWER
\u25a0 Because the -good - steamer Gipsy,
Thomas Boyd master, was steered into
a red light "marking the excavation for
a sewer in the town of -Monterey on
September 27 last, United States Local
Inspectors Bolles and Bulger have sus
pended f Captain .Boyd's license for
twelve months. The steamer struck on
the' rocks before she had time to reach
the sewer and was a total loss. The
vessel /was- valued at $20,000 and the
cargo at $5000. . .
- In their decision the inspectors say:
There were a number of red lights about the
town of Monterey that night, some of them
being railroad switch lights, which had been
there for several months, and others were on
city sewers being put In ' on streets near tbe
shore where tbe vesset struck. These latter
had only been placed there a few days before
this occurrence, and Captain Boyd says he mis
took one of these lights for the dock light.
â¢\u25a0 â¢ \u25a0 â¢ We are satisfied that Captain Thomas
Boyd was negligent and unskillful â¢ â¢. â¢ in
that when he changed his course he did not
give more careful attention to the speed of the
vessel and the time which had elaiwed after
passing the bell buoy; and In that/upon seeing
ao many ' red lights he did ' not proceed with
greater caution, especially as he had never pre
viously undertaken .to navigate a vessel into
Monterey harbor.
MUST INSTALL AS MANY '
HYDRANTS AS CITY ORDERS
City Attorney Long yesterday ad
vised the Supervisor*' Finance Commit
tee In an opinion that the Olympic Salt
Water Company \u25a0 under an ordinance
mu3t supply water from its mains free
of charge- to the city and that It may
not under the terms and conditions of
its franchise exact a charge of any
character for hydrants Installed at the
order of the Board of Supervisors. A
supplementary order, which greatly en
larged the privileges already granted
to the company, required it to furnish
and maintain twenty-five hydrants on
Point Lobos avenue, but there is in that
further condition Imposed no limita
tion upon the authority of the city to
erect as many hydrants as It may deem
proper and necessary and to require
the company to connect them with its
mains. Long says.
SOME CHANGES ARE MADE
* BY DISTRICT ATTORNEY
Assistant District Atorney X, V.
Whiting has been relieved from duty In
Superior Judge Frank H. Dunne's
court by District Attorney B'yington.
The change has been made at the re
quest of Whiting, so the story runs at
headquarters. Whiting has been as
signed to Judge Carroll Cook's depart
ment and Assistant District Attorney
R. Porter Ashe has taken the place of
Whiting in Judge Dunne's court.
Gossip in official circles atributes the
exchange to a lack of harmony be
tween Judge Dunne and Whiting. Both
men are popular, but appear to have
been unable to adjust their personal
relations. District Attorney Byington
said the change was made because
there 'are no cases In Judge Cook's, de
partment and he needs Whiting for
other duties. Yesterday Whiting was
on' Grand Jury work.

Money and Trade.
The New York Circular of Henry CJews
*ays: . .
\u25a0'Cautionary cignals are up in Wall street,
and this in *iÂ«ife vf exceptionally brilliant
businesb prospects. Er^th nioney and foreign
exchange have advanced, and tirm ratvs are
llksly to continue. The significant feature of
the situation in that this tension in the money
market is net confined to New York. In all
or the world's principal money markets rates
fcii\#- advanced, and those who hold the reins
cf SnsTiee are manifesting an increasingly pru
dent spirit. Interest rives at New York. Lon
dan, I*ar:s and Berlin have practically doubled
slnco the (jjienia* of September, and the va
riÂ£Â«is intematicna! money markets are show
ing a disposition to increase their supplies of
KOld at the expense of each other. Bank re
â¢rfr\-es at N>tv York are at the lowest point
witfcin % dozt-H years, save in one or two mo
mentary jÂ«Â»ri<Â»!s; while reserves of the great
roratan banks are also lower than usual arid
thÂ«tr managers openly recognize the necessity
!or czutios.
OUTLOOK STILL BRILLIANT.
'â¢There is no reason whatever for loss of
confidence. It is evident that we are going to
l".t.vÂ« a rood business year, regardless of tem
porary stock market fluctuations. Th<? iron,
coal and coke industries are each taxed to their
utmost capacity and prices are more likely to
rise than fall. Cotton manufacturers are re
storing wages to the former level, and tht
farming classes are enjoying unusual prosper
ity, the value or the wheat, corn, cats and
ctton cror* this year being estimated at
$?.<X.O,OOO.<H>U, or several hundred millions In
jL.cess of any other year as already said, the
"mssiness situation is excellent, but the banks
will have profitable employment for their
funds outside of Wall street, and stock specu
lation will have to wait for at least a partis I
tieturn of money from the interior and the
strengthening of reserves.
"A leature of some interest is the condition
cf our foreign trade. In the case of exports
It waÂ» the heaviest September on record, the
total being $136,O<JW.OO<X which is $2,000,000 in
excess of last year. October will also be a
month of heavy exi"ortp. Our large exports.
however, are being offset by the rapid growth
of Imports, the total or that item standing
at $K12.y00,C00 in September. The result was
an e-xcess cf exports for the month of over
$23.wH>.000 this year, apainst $50,000,000 a year
ago:" This tendency toward a diminished trade
bntanee is anything but favorable for gold Im
ports. In . fact, if it continues we are more'
likely to export than import gold. The inter
national money markets, therefore, will bear
close watching. I^ondon has special needs of
Its own, lirypt having drawn heavily npon
London r<-suuret?s; and Parts at the moment
appears to have the largest available . supply
or funds. In Germany a similar state of af
fairs exists to those in the Ur.lted Stat,es. and
< v*>!-aj'*<-ular:on is causing more or lew finan
cial etrain." .i.t^v,;;-;

NEW YORK, Oct. 25.â T0-day's active mar
tet wasirregUiar and uneven up to the abrupt
teneral fall in prices in the final hour of
railing and the conflicting currents in ths
iiaxket were so striking at times as' to Â«rye
t a decidedly feverish tone. Speculative :n
.erest c-rrtpred on the group of coalers, in
nblch there Kit some degree of excitement
tnd an advance to record prices in Important
snerclwrs of the group, including Read:ng,
L>elaware and Hudson and Central Railroad
it Npw JÂ»-rtey. A consplcuoua leadership in '
the operation wu held by operators on the
loor of the fxchar.Â«e who have figured prom
jiently in the transactions in Heading ror
ziany months past. No actual news waÂ»
.'orthcoming to explain the movement beyona
;\u25a0 O'.rfl consideration bearing upon the trace.
tut many surmises were afloat aÂ» a result of
lie larse demand for Lehlgh Valley In Phll
tdelphla. That company's recent purchase of
â¢hÂ« Coxe Brothers' Company and the ace ,m
panylng movement In the other coalers g;ve
rieÂ« to the conjecture that more effective com
air.atlocs an? working out in this group ot

inair*is -of- the Reading property and of Jtt
rapabilltles was another stimulating influenr*.
R^porU that the Delaware ajid Hudson haa

industry but dwelt with some insistence ur-oa
the action of the company la aceumulailnÂ«
ftocks a* a safeguard against possible labot
troubles. The market pawed over this sun
reÂ«tion with an equanimity not always shown
toward anything bearing on the labor ques
tion Some cf the soeclalties received further
attention, but there was a marked disposition
to discriminate among the members of this
rroup which was a result of the tmesslnes*
k Jiiuted by the low grade of some of the stocks
â¢^ which hayÂ« been stirred up into prominence
lately. Pome of these were Influenced by
jpÂ»cial considerations. A temporary advance
la Sugar was due to & suggestion of a possible
coming distribution of rurplus earnings. The
rise in Pacific Mail was explained by the re
turn from an Oriental trip or the head of the
â¢ soTTipa^y. ThÂ» advznre In the ccalers had some
ij-mpstfeti? effect in tb* rallroÂ«d llet. but It
etd n*^ extend far and did not persist. There

was given a litt.e darker aspect by a private,
cablegram which stated that Russian offering*
of wheat had ceased altogether. In the pit

Hay and Feedstuff*.
- The Bran trade was paralyzed yesterday by
the sudden arrival from Washington of 40,717
sacks of Bran. These are the heaviest ar
rivals of â¢ Bran I ever known In this market,
and for several hours the dealers were dazed
with the enormous quantity. \u25a0 The effect 03
the market was to break prices $1 60 per ton-
There were also ll;250 sacks of Shorts in, and
they weakened off .. also. Middlings declined
In sympathy with the other two and the feel
ing 'in these three products was demoralized
all around.
There was nothing \ new in Hay. Receipts
were light, consisting of 15 cars. ;
The circular of Somera & Co. 6ays:
/'Shipments of Hay â¢ have been somewhat
lighter during the past week than for several
weeks previous, the total showing but 2150
tons, in comparison with 2750 last week. Fully
half, the arrivals have been by water and all
Hay around . the bay available by schooner is
being 'marketed rapidly. It is generally con
ceded that the , present light receipts of Hay.
with 'the onsequent advance In prices. Is occa
sioned only by the car scarcity; therefore, all
who can are marketing their holdings to take
advantage of the present good range of prices.
Although the advance has been very marked
with the choicer' grades of Hay. yet with the
lower qualities there . seems to be but little
change. : Large quantities of game are \on
storage In the city here and it has become
generally known . that the country Is filled
with rather undesirable and unsalable â¢ grades
of Hay. Unless we have a continuance of
dry weather sufficient to create a scare, there
Is no doubt that \u25a0 present prices will be' dis
counted as soon as the car famine Is. at an
end. We are Informed on good authority that
this may be expected toward., the latter part
of November. -\u25a0 - \u25a0'- -
"The outlook is unchanged in every way,
for nothing new has \u25a0 developed | in the way of
a demand, although it must be conceded that
the large amount of railroad work, together
with flume and ditch work for irrigation pur
poses, is necessitating the consumption of
much Hay and Barley throughout the entire
State."

Deciduous and Cltrua Fruit*.
The fruit market was slenderly supplied with
fresh stock during: the early trad*, iaa * v Â°f
the boats were delayed on account of *n*
dense fog. and supplies that should have conyÂ»
to hand. early were not dellvere-i at the store*
until well on toward noon. Only carrfed-ovpr
table Grape* were available at the opening
and -dealers were able to dispose of old stock
to advantage. The belated arrivals of fresb
Grapes came In to a weak market â¢ and thÂ«^
was quite a surplua unsold at the: dose. Wins
Grapes were quoted nominal, there b.elns very
few offering.. The market for good' Apples \u25a0 was
In fair shape, with fancy stock selling well at
steady prices. Figs and Perslmnlons were
higher under light receipts and Quinces, Pome-
Eranatee. Plums and good eating \u25a0 Pears were
Fepovted steady to firm. There was very little
doing in Melona. Cantaloupes and Nutmegs
arrived late and most, of them had to Be new
over. Berries were In light receipt and thi>ro
was a general advance -In prices. In - the
Citrus market everything 'except MexlcMl

Offerings of the latter were too green to
invite custom. Old and intermediate _crop
Oranges were closely cleaned up -ana Grape

Dr. Lawrence Uewellyn Sherrod, con
rlct*d of mailing obscene matter, was
sentenced yesterday morning by United
States District Judge de Haven to pay
a 'fine of J2OO or to be imprisoned in
the County Jail until the fine should
have been paid. The defendant handed

Bert Schlesinger made a motion in
the United States District Court yes
lerday to modify the form of the sen
tence heretofore passed upon Kmil H.
Kanngiesser. The defendant had plead
ed guilty to an indictment containing
eight counts, charging him 'with hav
ing embezzled money from letters
while he was a plerk in the Postofllce.
The minimum sentence on each count
had been imposed, aggregating eight
years* imprisonment in the peniten
tiary. Counsel for the defendant asked
to have the sentence modified so that
each count and the sentence thereunder
might be segregated, instead of aggre
gated, as had been done. Judge de
Haven denied the motion and an ap
peal will be taken.

FOR RECEIVER
Sturtevant Will Proceed
Against United Bank and
Trust Company in Court
Deputy Attorney General Sturtevant,
in pursuance of his promise of' Tuesday,
delivered an answer yesterday in behalf
of the Bank Commissioners to the officers
and attorneys of the United Bank and
Trust Company concerning the conditions
that would be necessary to secure the
consent of the Commissioners to reopen
the bank of the company. Before giving
this answer Mr. Sturtevant consu *d
with Sank Commissioner Dunsmoor and
learned what requirements would be sat
isfactory to the Commissioners.
Attorneys Dinkelspiel . and Newhouse
and Messrs Freeman, Moise'anoTHelbing,
members of the board of directors of the
bank,, called at the Attorney General's
office and heard that the Attorney Gen
eral demanded that before the doors can
be reopened there must be enough cash
on hand to pay all depositors in full; that
the impairment of the capital, to the;
amount of about {18,000, must be made
good; that the bonds of the United States
Abstract Company, in which 550,000 of the
bank's money is invested, shall be con
verted intp cash; that all promissory
notes given in payment for capital stock
of the bank to the amount of $140,000 shall
be eliminated; that there shall be a com
plete change in the management of the
bank and In the board of directors.
Deputy Attorney General Sturtevant
also told the representatives of the
United Bank and Trust Company, that he
would probably file a complaint in the
Superior Court next Monday asking for
a receiver for .the institution. The at
torneys for the bank said in response that
they would do the best they could to ful
fill all these conditions, and the confer
ence then ended.

TAILOR UN GALLANTLY
BATTERS A WOMAN.
A vers the Blow Was
, Amply Provoked
Ere Struck.
Swears His Home
Was Meeting Place
for Gossips.
JAMES C. CRAWFORD.
In defense of. his having battered Mrs.
Mmnie Jacobs of 1119V4 Harrison street,
Solomon Schlff. tailor; pleaded that the
provocation more than justified the aot
of ungallantry. Mortal man, he added,
could, not passively endure the annoy
ance he had been subjected to era anger
supplanted discretion and Impelled him to
strike. But when his ire mellowed ho
regretted the blow, because Mrs. Jacobs
was no more entitled to it than was Mrs.
Stein or Mrs. Sternbergâ aye, or his own
helpmeet. But that each of j the ladies
mentioned deserved punishment of some
kind for their treatment of him- he 'still
maintained, although he .would not In
sist that the ohaetisement should be cor
poral. Nor would he have . retaliated
with battery if both hlB reason and his
innate sense of chivalry had not been de
throned by cumulative persecution..
"But what did the women do to arouse
your wrath?" he was asked by Police
Judge Mogan.
They transformed his home, at 1120
Howard street, into a gossip club, he re
plied. .It was the custom of Mesdames
Jacobs, Stein and Steinberg, collectively
and individually, to drop into his domi
cile at any or all times of day and dis
tract his wife's attention from her house
hold duties. When he remonstrated with
his better half she inquired if he desired
to have her dwell as a hermit, and when
he hinted that his companionship should
suffice to content her she asked him if he
was satisfied to go through Jife without
having friends of his own sex: " So "the
three matrons continued to visit Mrs.
Schiff and harass him by their small
talk, which consisted largely of an inter
change of Information concerning bar
gain sales, with an occasional lapse into
mild scandal, while Tie stitched and suf
fered in 'silence until finally his patience
succumbed. " ". '
It was after he had ordered Mrs. Jacobs,
Mrs. .Stein and Mrs. Steinberg to leave
his house, and the ladies were on the
sidewalk, that .the battery occurred. In
stead of respecting his authority as king
of his abode, the ejected ones stood at the
door and cast commiserating glances at
his wife and fervently thanked the fate
that had averted their being bound In
wedlock to an ill-tempered tyrant, Mrs,
Jacobs being . especially eloquent in such
self-gratulation. He did not,- however,
single out that ; lady as an object of at
tack. Indeed, the best proof that his
anger completely ousted his prudence was
shown by the fact that she was heavier
and more muscular than either of her
companions. If his onslaught I had been
deliberately, premeditated he certainly
would not have selected- heritor" its recip
ient, as she was larger physically than
he| while Mrs. Stein and .Mrs. Steinberg
were about his own weight. No, sir; he
struck out blindly and on the spurof the
moment, and no sooner did '-Mrs. 'Jacobs
drop 'neath the impact of ihls^flst 'gainst
her jaw than he was sorry for? both her
and himself, and if Mrs.- Stein and. Mrs.
Steinberg had stood their i ground , instead
of fleeing the spot they .would have been
absolutely immune from assault 'by his
hands.
Mrs. Stein and Mrs. Steinberg told the
Judge that of all the rage-blinded crea
tures they had ever seen or read about
or heard of, Mr. Schlff was the worst
when /he committed the . discourtesy jof
commanding them to leave his house and
then climaxed the indignity by battering*
Mrs. Jacobs, who - certainly * did not- say
anything to him that would Justify his re
tallative blow.
Mr. Schiff' s sentence will be pronounced
this morning. â
C. D. Hathaway casually glanced out
a window of his home, 1201 Taylor street,
and in the garden'thereto attached saw a

\u25a0 The pawnbroker identified Mr.. Johnson
as the. person who \ pledg*d the watch;

quest for a small loan when Patrolman
Kiel arrested him for beeeing.
"I'm a-Btandln f a-lukklnVat some build

He wag a new one to the policeman, and
as neither Bailiff Conlon nor Clerk Duf
fle knew of a "prior" against him the
Judge told him to hasten to, Oakland.
He respond^! with seeming alacrity, but
was, apparently unable to find' a. way â out
of the courtroom, for after vainly, trying
to open several locked doors he asked for
information as to the proper means of
exit, and when shown it he vanished with
great precipitancy.
A moment later Bailiff Doherty. dashed
into the tribunal and up to, the bench and
Inquired if "that fat bum. White," had

"Why it's the third time he has been
up here for begging!" exclaimed the
bailiff, disgustedly.
*'Ah, well," sighed his Honor. "He wil
be up here a gain, and justice can wait."'
From reliable habitues of the, corridor
it was ascertained that no soo*ner did Mr.
White emerge from the courtroom than
he rushed to the stairs,' to which he need
ed no guidance, and descended them with
a rapidity that endangered his neck. Also,
that when he arrived at the mezzo-land
ing and turned his eyes upward and saw
Bailiff Doherty staring at him with dis
tended optics he made a flying leap to the

as it lay awaiting shipment on the steam

SCORE POINTS
AGAINST KYTKA
Proponents of the Davis
Codicil Spring Surprises on
the Handwriting Expert
SENSATION IS AVERTED
Demand for Namfe of Person
Suspected v of ' Forgery Is
Temporarily Withdra^vn
: A desire ' of counsel for the proponents
of the codicil of the will of the late
Samuel Davis to further discuss the pro
priety of demanding that the contestants,
through Theodore Kytka, handwriting ex
pert, expose the name of the man they
suspect of forging, as charged, the codi
cil in' question, robbed the hearing before
Judge Kerrigan yesterday of what might
have proved a sensation.
Kytka. was under cross-examination
and had reiterated his opinion that the
will was a forgery, when E, S. . Pillsbury,
chief counsel for. the proponents, aston
ished Â§ the contestants \u25a0 when, addressing
Kytka, he said:
"You said.lt was another man's.hand
writing. Whoidld It?"
In an instant Attorney T. C. Van Ness,
of I counsel for \ the contestants, was on
, his feet vigorously objecting to the Ques
tion. "We object,'' he said, "to collateral
matters being gone 'into at this time.
We do not believe the . question Is a
proper one, and I do not purpose taking
the responsibility upon myself for an
exploitation of this feature of the' case."
.' "The question Is entirely proper," said
Mr. Pillsbury, "especially in view of the
fact that these contestants have { by in
nuendo laid this serious charge against
a man; we know to b"e of the highest in
tegrity. They took the deposition of this
man , and at the request ' of Mr. Kytka
caused him to write in a certain* way, on
the .taking of his deposition, a copy (of
this contested codicil, which fact reached
the public press, thereby seriously reflect
ing upon this man. This question is 1 now
proper . that * this Jury in passing upon
the genuineness of this will shall have
the opportunity to . vindicate this man
against whom these shafts have r been
aimed. If the gentlemen on .the "other
side will withdraw the outrageous charge
made against this gentleman we will not
insist upon an answer." . v
QUESTION IS WITHDRAWN.
Van Ness still protested against the al
lowance of the question by the /court,
and while he was thus protesting Mr.
Pillsbury was consulting with Mr. Mc-
Enerney regarding the . advisability of
insisting upon the witness answering the
question. When -Van Ness \u25a0.' concluded
Judge Kerrigan announced that if the
proponents insisted" on - an answer he
would order the witness # to respond. -Mr.
Pillsbury said, however, that he desired
to consult further with Mr. ; McEnerney
as to the advisability of demanding an
answer and for. the present the question
would be withdrawn.
The cross-examination of Kytka then
proceeded. In his direct examination
Kytka had expressed astonishment at the
fact that in one of the bequests in the
codicil the writer of the will had super
posed a figure 1 over the figure 2. reduc
ing the bequest from $20,000 to 510,000.
Kytka was then shown two exemplars of
admittedly genuine handwritings of the
deceased jin which the same change, had
been made in the same manner. Kytka
endeavored' to demonstrate his theory
that while in /each instance one figure
had been placed over another,, which
seemed to be a habit with Davis, there
was a difference in the manner in which
the figures in the exemplars were super
poÃed and that evident In the contested
codicil. To. the layman's eye, however,
they appeared to be . identical.
POINT FOR PROPONENTS.
Kytka also made a point of the fact
that in the codicil the 'name Creswell
was spelled with one "s," while in
various other instances he spelled It
with two. Counsellor the proponents
introduced exemplars in which Davis
spelled the name as it is spelled in the
codicil, thus meeting the point made by
Kytka in this direction..
The proponents further disconcerted
the contestants by producing a wrap
per in which Davis kept photographs,
on which the word "niece" appeared,
correctly spelled, as in the codicil. The
contestants asserted that Davis was in
the habit of spelling the word with the
c before - the i, making, it "neice." The
wrapper produced yesterday is the
third exemplar to be produced by the
proponents on which the word appears
correctly spelled.
When this wrapper', was -produced It
was shown to Kytka with the -request
that he pronounce ; it genuine. This he
refused to do, stating that he insisted
that he first be given the right to ex
amine it microscopically. Counsel then
asked him if he would do this In the
presence of, a photographer to be des
ignated by the proponents. This he at
first refused to do, but finally consented
after it was ; agreed that a third out
side photographer should also be pres
ent to view the examination of the
paper, an attorney from each side also
to be present.
The case goes on again to-day.

COLLINS STAYS
IN JAIL CELL
George D. Collins, the attorney, who
returned Tuesday from Victoria, B. C,
In charge of Detective Thomas Gibson,
has not procured the $15,000 ball which
will when furnished give him liberty
pending his trial on a charge of per
jury.
Collins has been assigned a cell at
the County Jail, which he will occupy
meanwhile, unless sureties come to his
relief and supply the required bond-
Life in the jail under existing condi
tions will not be agreeable, for the
place is crowded and the returned at
torney, has been compelled to. share his
compartment , with a petty larceny
thief, one St. John.
This is in sharp contrast to tho free
dom the San Franciscan enjoyed while
he was the guest of the authorities in
the British Columbia seaport. It Is re
lated that before the fugitive's, money
gave out he was*wined and dined like
a nabob. Alas, for the frailty of the
human heart! The' cold shoulder was
tunned when the bank roll vanished.
With Collins safe in jail the police
have given belated attention to discov
ering the whereabouts of Airs. Clarice
McCurdy-Collins, wife No. 2. and Mrs.
Sarah A. McCurdy. They departed
from Victoria before Collins did and it
was supposed had returned to San
Francisco to lend a helping hand here.
The women are evading service of
bench warrants Issued by Superior
Judge Thomas S.Lennon because they
failed to appear before him July 2. the
day Collins' disappearance was made
public. Both women will be cited to
show cause why they should not be
punished for contempt of court for fail
ure to respond to thÂ« court's orfier.
Detective Ross . Whitaker made & fu
tile search for Mrs. McCurdy and her
daughter, and returned the warrants to
Department 11 of the Superior Court,
noting. that he could locate neither one
of * them. Detective Thomas Gibson,
who knowi the pair, haa been'tnbstl
tuted by. Acting Captain of Detectives
Harry Reynolds in. the hope -that he
will be â¢ able to run ' down : the women.
District Attorney Byington has re
quested the police department to malts
a diligent â¢ search. ' If Mrs. MoCurdy
and > Mrs. Collins No. 2 are arrested
they will be delivered Into the Sheriff's
custody, to be held without ball;pend
ing a hearing fat the contempt proceed
ings, v .
