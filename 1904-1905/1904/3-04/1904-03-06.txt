were a novelty to her, and she regard

k-.owledge and experience in that won

freckles over her nose, and lips
that were freshly red and delicately
defined against the warm pallor sur
rounding: them. She was, in fact, a
beautiful likeness of the Lucy that
Moreau saw come gropingly back to
youth and desirableness in the cabin
on the flank of the Sierra. Only happi
ness and refinement and a youth passed
in an atmosphere of love, had given her
all that richness of girlhood, that effer
vescent confidence and joy of youth
that poor Lucy had never known.
Despite her air of a young princess,
her proudly held head, her almost
Spanish dignity, where only her brown
Â«-yes looked full of alertness and laugh
ter, she was in character and knowl
edge of life foolishly youngâ in reality,
a little girl masquerading in the guise
of a triumphantly maturing woman
hood. Her life had been one of quiet
ude and Feclusior-. Her parents had
been agreed in their desire for this; the
father in the fear of a re-encounter with
fime phantom from the past. Lucy's
ostensible reason was her own delicate
health ; but her dread was that Shack

It seemed impossible to the adoring
mother that any father could see this
splendid daughter ar.d not rise up and
â¢ â¢fill her his before all men. ...
The afternoon was cold and Mari
posa wore a Jacket as she sang. The
rottage in Pine street was all that a
eottape ought not to be â on the wrong
side of the street, "too far out," cold,
badly built, and with only one window
to catch the western sun. It had one
advantage which went a long way with
.the widow and her daughter â the rent
v.-ss ?20 a month. Mariposa had paid
$10 c-f this with her earnings, and kept
the Â«>ther six for pocket money. But
the happy day was dawning,* so she
thought, when she could pay the whole
twenty. Fhe cogitated on this and the
affluence it would indicate, as her real
father mirrht have cogitated when he

mineral.
On this* pray afternoon the cold little
parlur, with its bulge of bay window
looking out on the dreariness of the
Ftreet. peemed impregnated with an
p.ir of dejection. In common with many
IÂ«oct dwellings in that city of extrava
gant reverses, it was full of the costly
relics Â«>f better days., San Francisco
has more of Euch parlors than any city
i;Â« the country. The pieces of buhl and
marquetry hiding their shame in 520
cottages and $1S flats furnish pathetic
.commentary on many a story of fallen
fortunes. The furniture looks abashed
and humbled. Sometimes its rich de-
Figns have found a grateful seclusion
under thf dust of a quarter century,
â¢which finally v.lll be removed by the re
storing processes of the second-hand'
dealer, who will eventually 'jecorae Its
owner.
There was a beautiful marquetry
sideboard in the gray front parlor and
a 3ne ecarlet lacquer Chinese cabinet
facing it. Mcreau had had the tall.
Silt-framed mirror and console brought
round the Horn from New York when
he had been in the flush of good times
in Sacramento. The piano Mariposa
was playing: dated from a second period
cf proFperity, ar.d had cost what would
have now kept them for a year. It had
been considered cheap at the time t and
had been bought when the little Mari
posa began to show musical tastes. She
had played her first "pieces" on it, and
in that halcyon period when she had
had the singing lessons, had heard the
big voice in her chest slowly shaking
itself Iooec to the accompaniment of its
encouraging notes.
Now she was sinking in single tones,
from note to note, higher and higher,
then lower and lower. Her voice was a
merzo, with a "break" In the middle,
below which it had a haunting, bell-like
depth. As it went dow nit gained a
peculiar emotional quality which
seemed to thrill with passion and tears.
As it began to ascend" it was noticeable
thut her upper tones, though full, were
harsh. There was astounding volume
in them. It was evidently a big voice,
a thins of noble promise, but now crude
and unmanageable.
She emitted a loud vibrant note that
rolled restlessly between the four walls,
as if in an effort to find more space
wherein to expand, and her hands fell
upon the keys. In the room opening off
the parlor there was an uncertain play
of light from an unseen fire, and a
muffled shape lying on the sofa. To
this the now addressed a query in a
voice in which dejection was .veiled -by
uneasy Inquiry:
"Well, does It seem to improve?. Or
is It still like a cow when she's lost her
calf?"

"Mariposa's always well,", said Lucy,
pressing the hand she still. held. "She
was always a prize child ever since she
was a baby." ' .
Mrs. Willers leaned back and folded
her white gloved hands over her creak
ing waist, -'y* -''".',' :"Â¦ â¢
-"You know she is the handsomest
thing I've seen in' a , coon's age,", she
said, nodding her head at., Mariposa,

"Well," she said, rustling in, "here's
the lady! How's everybody? Just as
cozy and cute as a doll's house.'!
She pressed Mrs. Moreau's* hand and
then sent an eagle glance â the glance
of the reporter that is trained. to take
in every salient object in one sweep â
about the room. She could have writ
ten a good description of It from that
moment's survey.
"Better? Of course you're better,"
she interrupted Lucy, who had been
speaking of improved health. "Don't
San Francisco cure everybody? And
daughter there?" her bright tired eye
rested on Mariposa for one inspecting:
moment. "She looks nice enough to

She V.-2S c Mrs. /Willers-, long divorced
frcm a worthless husband, and sup
porting, with' a desperate and gallant
courage, herself and her child, who was
one of Muriposa's piano pupils. Her
appearance grave no clue to the real
force and indomitable bravery of. the
woman, who, s gainst blows and rebuffs,
had fought her way with a smile on her
lips. Her appearance and manner, es
pecially in this, her society pose, were
against her. The former was flashy
and overdressed, the latter loud-voiced
and effusive. A large hat. flaunting:
with funeral plumes, was set jauntily
on one side of her head, and a spotted
veil was drawn over a complexion that
was carelessly made. up. Her corsets
were so long and so tight she could
1 dly bend, and when she did they
emitted protesting creaks. No one
would have thought from her flamboy
antly stylish get-up that she was a re
porter and "special" writer on Jake
Shackleton's newly acquired paper. The
Morning Trumpet! But In reality she
was an energetic and able journalist.
It was only when adorned with her
best clothes and her "society" manners
that she affected a sort of gushing silli
ness. .
The visitor was a tall, .thin woman of
40 yearc, her cheaply fashionable dress
telling of many a wrestle between love
of personal adornment and a lean
purse. She was one <it those slightly
known and iinquectioninsly accepted
people that women. : in the friendless
and unknown condition of^th? Moreaus,
constantly meet in the free and easy
sorial life of western cities.
Mariposa sat down on the end of the
pofa at the invalid's feet and took one
of her hands. She had loved both pa
rents deeply, but the fragile mother,
bo simple and unworldly, so dependent
on affection for her being, was the obf
ject of her special devotion. They were
silent, the girl with 1 an abstracted
glance fixed on the fire, meditating on
the future of her voice; the mother re
garding her with, pensive admiration. "
As they, sat thus, a) footfall 'Â¦ on the
steps outside Â¦ broke upon their
thoughts. The -cottage was 'so built
that one of Its conveniences was that
one could always hear* the caller or the
man with the bill mounting the steps
before he rang. The former were rarer
than the latter, and Mariposa, In whose
eventless life a visit, from any one was
a thing of value, pricked up her ears
expectantly. , jr . .-
The bell pealed stridently and the ser
vant could^ be ;heard rattling pans In
the kitcheni^evidently preparatory to
emerging. Presently she came creaking
duwn the hall, the door opened and a
female voice was heard asking for the
ladies. It was a visitor. Mariposa was
glad she had stayed in that afternoon,
and with her hand still clasping her
mother's, craned her neck toward the
door.
tne aniwer rrom the room beyond; "I
don't think any one sings like you.
Anyway, no one has such a powerful
voice."
"No one howls so. you mean! Oh,,
mother, do you suppose I ever shall be
able to take any more lessons?"
"Oh, yes, of course. We are in a
large city now. Even if you don't make
enough money yourself, there are often
people who become interested In fine
voices and educate them, j Perhaps
you'll meet one of them some day. And
anyway â " with cheerfulness caught on
the upward, breath of a sigh â "you'll
make money enough soon yourself." .
Mariposa's head bent over the keys.
When she came to view it this way. her
$16 a month did not seem so big with
promise as It did when $10 for rent was
all it Jiad to yield up.
"I've heard about those rich people
who are looking for prlma donnas to
develop, but I don't know where to find
them, and I don't see how they're to
find me. The only way I can ever at
tract their notice is to sing on the street
corner with a guitar, like Rachel. And
then I'd have to have a license, and
I've got no money for that."
She rose, and swept with the gait of
a queen Into the next room. Her moth

a tiny grate, in which a handful of fire
nickered.

a thin, faded delicacy of aspect. Her
skin was singularly -white.especlally on

ered her child's rude birth in the desert
and the subsequent journey across the
Sierra.' She had twined round and
clung to the man whom she had called
husband, and' with his loss she was
slowly sinking out of the world his
presence had made sweet for her. Her
daughter â next In adoration to the hero
who had succored her in her hour of
extremity â had no power to hold her.
Lucy was slowly fading out of life. The
girl had no knowledge of this. Her
mother had been a semi-invalid for sev
eral years, and her own youth was so
rich in its superb vigor, that she did not
notice the elder gradual de
cline of vitality. But the mother knew,
and her nights w # ere wakeful and agon
ized with the thought of her child, left
alone, poor and unfriended.
"Mother!" she cried, before she got
Into the room, "isn't that the most
thrilling thing? Oh, did you ever know
of anything so unexpected and wonder
ful and exciting. Do you think he'll
like my voice? Do you think he really
could be interested in me because he
knew father? And he can't have
known him so very well, or father
would have said more of him. Did you
ever hear father speak about him?"
The mother gave no answer, and the
girl bent over her. Lucy, motionless
and white, was lying among her cush
ions, unconscious. tff.??
Darkness had fallen when the guest,
having threshed out the subject to th a
last grain, took herself off. Mariposa
looked from the open doorway into a
black street, dotted with the yellow
blurs, of lighted lamps. The air was
cold with that penetrating marrow
searching coldness of a foggy evening
In San Francisco. As the night swal
lowed Mrs. Willers. Mariposa shut the
door and came rushing back.
"Oh. mother, do. You know you go
out on the cars sometimes, and the Sut
ler-street line Is only two blocks from
here. I know you'd enjoy it when you
got there."
"No, dearest. No. Mrs. Willers.
Don't, please, urge me. I am not- able
to meet now people. N'o â Oh, please
don't talk any more about my going."
Something of pain and protest in
her voice made them desist. She was
silent again, vhile JIariposa and Mrs.
Willers arranged the details of the
party. This was to be email and choice.
Only one other person, a man referred
to as Essex, was to come. At the name
of Essex, Mrs. Willers shot a side look
jf Inspection. a.t Mariposa, who did what
was expected of her. In displaying a fine
blush. ';
It was 'decided that Mrs. Willers' hns^
pitality should take the form of wine
and cake. There was a consultation
about other and lesser viands, and
finally an animated discussion as to th^
proper garb in which Mariposa should
present herself to the first truly dis
tinguished person she had ever met.
During the conversation over these
varied questions Lucy lay back among
her cushions, sunk In the same pale
silence. :â¢ -â¢'
"Of course it would be only In that
way," murmured Lucy sinking back.
"No, I can't come. It wouldn't be
possible. I'm not well enough."
"And you'll come, too?", said Mrs.
Willers. "He asked about you."
"Did he say he'd ever known me?"
said Lucy, quietly.
"Noâ not exactly that. No, I don't
believe he said that. But he was inter
ested In you as .the wife of the man
he'd known so long ago."
Lucy gave a sudden gasping breath
and sat up. The light of the gray
afternoon was dying outside, and by
the glow of the fire her unusual pallor
was not noticeable.
"It was very good of you,'\she said.
"Mariposa will be glad to go."
"Don't you talk that way. You'll
sing your best. And he's not a man
that you wouldn't like Mariposa to
meet"â turning to the pale and silent
Lucy. "Whatever other faults he's
had he's always been a straight man
with women. There's never been that
sort of scandal about Jake Shackleton.
There's a story you've probably heard,
that he was originally a Mormon. I
don't believe much in that myself. He
had. anyway, only one wife when he
entered California, and she's been his
wife ever since, and she ain't the kind
to have stood any nonsense of the
Mormon sort."
"Good gracious!" said Mariposa.
whose cheeks were crimson. ".I never
heard anything so exciting in my life,
and we were just talking about It. I'll
probably sing like a dog baying the
moon." -
"I? Why, of course. I saw my open-
Ing and jumped in. I said. 'Well. I
guess I can arrange for you to meet
Miss Moreau at my rooms. I see her
twice a week when she comes to give
Edna her piano lesson. I'll ask her
when she can come, and let you kno^v.
and then she'll sine for you.' He. was
pleased, he was real pleased, and said
he'd come v.henever I said. And now.

gloved hand on Marip.osa'3 knee, "that
ought to be the beginning of a career
for you!"
"That was father exactly. He must
have known him well. Mother. Isn't it
odd he never spoke of him? What did
you say then?"
Dan Moreau's daughter lack for any
thing. Her father'd have left a for

thought of every one else before him

TOMORROW'S TANGLEShackleton made no answer. She
was used to reading his expression, and
the odd thought crossed her mind that
this remark of hers was unpleasant to
him.
Before she had time to reply a knock
at the door announced the arrival of
Mariposa. As she 'entered the two men
stood up, both looking at her with
veiled eagerness. To Essex his feeling
"Moreau had a dozen chances^ of
making his pile, as every man ' did in
those days," he said. "He was the
sort of man who is predestined to leave
his family poor."
"Yet they worship his memory," said
Mrs. Willers. "He must have been
very good to them." \
"No-o," she answered, "not exactly
that. Mr. Moreau left a life insurance
policy of $5000. Mariposa tells me that
$3000 of that went to pay his doctors'
bills and funeral expenses. He was
sick a long time. They are now living
on their capital, and they've been here
four months, and Mrs. Moreau has con
stant medical attendance."
'The millionaire gave a little click of
his tongue significant of annoyance.
"I've known Miss Moreau for three
months," he replied.. "I met her
here."
Shackleton turned back to Mrs. Wil
lers.
"I understand from you, Mrs. Willers,
that these ladies are left extremely
badly off. Are they absolutely without
means?"
f or her was making her. every appear- *
ance an event. To Shackleton It was a
moment of quivering interest In a ca
reer full of tumultuous moments.
A slight flush mounted to his face as
he met her eyes. She instinctively
looked at him first, with a charming,
look, girlish, shy and deprecating. Her
likeness to her mother struck him like
a blow, but she was an Amazonian
Lucy, with air that Lucy had lacked.
He saw himself in the stronger Jaw
and the firm lips. Physically, she was
molded of them both. | His heart
swelled with a passionate pride.. This,,
indeed, was his own child, bone of his
bone, and flesh of his flesh.
The introductions over, they resettled
themselves, and Mariposa found herself
beside. this quiet, gray-haired man,
talking quite volubly. . She was not shy
nor nervous, as she had expected to . be,
but felt peculiarly at her ease.' Looking
at her with intent eyes, he spoke to her
of the early days in California, ; when
he and her parents had come across.
. "You know, I.knew your father. in the
Sierras, long ago," he said. ' â¢
< "Yes," she answered rather hurriedly,
fearful lest he should ask her. if her
father had not spoken of hinv "so Mrs.
Willers said. It must have been a long
time ago. Was I there?" she added
with a smile. |
He* was taken aback by . the question ..
and said, stammeringly: -â¢-''' Â¦ â¢
"Well, really now, Iâ Iâ don't quite
remember." * \
"I guess I wasn't," she said laughing.
"You must have known father, before
that. He' came, ovi . in forty-nine, you
know. I was born twenty-foÂ«r years
ago up in the mountains, in El. Dorado"
County, in. a little cabin miles, from
Placervllle. Mother's often . described
the place to me. They left soon after.".
He lowered his eyes. He was a man
of no sentiment or tenderness, ..yet
something in this false statement,' ut
tered so innocently . by. these ; .fresh
young lips, and taught with all, the
- licitude of love to this simple nature,
pierced like an arrow to the live spot
in Ijis deadened conscience.
"It -was more, than twenty-five years

Here Mrs.- Willers cut short the con-
ing another, and yet another song.
Only the clock chiming four roused him
to the fact that he must go. He was
living ' at his country " place at Menlo
Park and had to catch a train. He left
, them with assurances of his delight in
the performance. To Mariposa, as he
pressed- her hand in farewell, he said:
"I'll see you again. You've a. wonder
ful" voice, there's no mistake about that.
It's 1 a gift, a great gift, and it must
have its chance."
The- girl, carried away with the tri
umph of the afternoon, said gayly:
- "I'll sing for you whenever you like.
Could you never come up to our cottage
on Pine "street and meet my mother? I
know she would like to see you."
The slightest possible look of surprise
passed over his face, gone almost as
as it had come. Mariposa saw it,
however, and felt embarrassed. She
evidently had been too forward, and
looked down, blushing and uncomforta
ble. He recovered himself immediately,
and said:~\
1 "Not now, much as I should like to,
. Miss Moreau. I am living at Menlo
, Park," and all my spare time when busi
ness is over is spent in catching trains
"Tour youns men shall see visions, and jour
old men shall dream dreams." â Acts.
After he had put Mariposa on her car.
Essex went downtown to the paper
with some copy. He was making a fair
living on The Trumpet, and the work
he was doing suited him. He thought
he mfght last the winter and he had no
objections to passing the winter in San
Francisco. Like many of his kind, he
felt the lazy Bohemian charm of tha
adverse, many-colored, cosmopolitan
city sprawled on its sand dunes. Ths
restaurants alone made life more worth
while than anywhere else in the coun
try except New York.
To-night he went to one, for dinner,
that stood in Clay street, a short dis
tance below Kearny. He had a word
to say to the white-clothed chef, who
cooked the dinner in plain sight, on a
small oven and grill, beneath which tho
charcoal gleamed redly. He stopped
for a moment's badinage with the
buxom, fresh-faced French woman who
sat at the desk. She was the chefs
wife, Madame Bertrand, and liked
"Monsieur Esseex." who spoke her na
tal tongue as well as she did. There
was evidently truth in one piece of Es
sex's autobiography. Only a childhood
spent in France could teach the kind of
French he spoke with Madame Ber
trand.
He sat long over his dinner, smoking
and reading the evening papers. It was
so late when he left that Bertrand him
self came out of his cocking corner and
talked with him about Paris. "Mon
sieur Esseeex" knew Paris as well as
Bertrand, some parts of It better. He
had been educated there at one of the
large lycees. and had -gone back many
times, living now or one shle ot the
river, now on the other. Bertrand, In
his white cap and apron, conversing
with his guest, retained a curious man
ner of deference unusual In California.
* "Monsieur is a gentleman of some
kind or other." he told madame.
"There are many different kinds of

CHAPTER III.
"Do you think I've sot a gcod voice?"
said MariDosa, stopping in the street
and staring morosely at him.
"Of course I do, dear lady,"
"Do you, really?"
"Yes, really." Â¦
She smiled and tried to hide it by
looking down. It was hardly in a man
to continue bad-humored before this
naive display of pleasure at his com
mending word.
"You really think I might some day
become a singer, a professional sing
er?"
"I really do."
The smile broadened and lit her face.
"You always make me feel so stupid
âandâ andâ as if I didn't amount to
anything." she murmured.
It was so ssreet. so childishly candid,
that It melted the' last remnant of his
bad temper.
"You little goose," he said softly,
"don't you know I think more of you
than I do of any one In San Francisco?
[fs getting dark; take my arm till w
get to the car."
She did so and they moved forward.
"Or anywhere else," he murmured.
Mariposa felt her hopes as to tha
training of her voice becoming mean
and vulgar.
"He said he wantfd to hÂ»ar me." sho
said stumblingly, "and she said It
would be a good things And I have no
money to educate my voice, and It's all
T have. Why do you se*m to disap
prove of it?"
"I?â disapprove? That would hardly
do. Why even If I wanted to. I have
not the right to. have I?"
Maripcsa's face flushed. She felt
Â«iow, that she had presupposed an in
timacy between them which he wanted
politely to suggest did not exist. This
was not by any means the first time
Essex had baffled and embarrassed her.
It amused him to do It, but to-day ha
was In a bad temper a!nd did it from
spleen.
"Somehow Jake Shackleton doesn't
suggest himself to me as a patron of
the arts," he said. "I don't think ha
knows "Yankee Doodle' from 'God Save
the Queen.' "
Mariposa thought of \he brilliant ar
ticle on the Italian opera, from Bellini
to Verdi, that the man beside her had
contributed to last Sunday's Trumpet*
and Jake Shackleton'a enthusiastic ad
miration of her singing immediately
eeemed the worthless praise of sodden
Ignorance.
"Then," she said desperately, "you
wouldn't attach any importance, if you
were I, to hia liking my singing? It
was just the way some people lika a
street organ simply because it plays
tunes."
"Oh, I wouldn't think that. There's
no reason why he shouldn't know a
good voice when he hears it."
"Oh, she's not an ass that way," he
answered. "She's an ass ttÂ» try and
work Shackleton up to the point of be
coming a patron of the arts â as repre
sented by you."
He turned on her with a slight smile,
that brought no suggestion of amuse
ment to his somewhat saturnine face.
"Isn't that her idea?" he asked.
This quality was in his manner now,
and she began to feel how raw har
poor performance must have seemed to
the man who had heard the great
prima donnas of London and Paris.
"It was a small room, of course," she
assented, "but I had to sing somewhere,
and I couldn't hire a place.''
"Shackleton wanted to hear you, as I
understand it. Mrs. Willers said some
thing about his knowing your father."
There was no question about the
coldness of his voice now. Had Mari
posa known more about men she would
have seen he was irritated.
She repeated the fable of her father's
early acquaintance with Jake Shackle
ton, and of the latter's desire expressed
to- Mrs. Willera, of hearing her sing.
"Mrs. Wlllers is such an ass I" he said
suddenly and vindictively.
Mariposa was this time hurt for her
friend and spoke up:
"I don't see why you say that. I
don't think a woman's an asa who can
support herself and a child as sho
does"â she thought of her $16 and
added: "It's very hard for a woman
to make money."
"It was excellent, of course. ..You've
got a voice. But the room was too
smallâ and such a room to sing In, all
crowded with ridiculous things."
Mariposa felt hurt. She thought Es
mex was the finest, the most elegant and
finished person she had ever met. Ha
seemed to her to breathe the atmos
phere of those great sophisticated
cities she had never seen. In his talks
with her he now and then chilled her
by his suggestion of belonging to an
other and a wiser world, to which shÂ»
was a provincial outsider.
against the fiery background.
"How did you like it?" said Mariposa.
as they loitered on, "my singing. I
mean?"
But give your, mother my compliments
on the possession of such a daughter."
'Mariposa and Essex stayed chatting
with. Mrs. Willers for some time after
Shackle ton's departure. The clock had
chimed more than once, when finally
they left, and their hostess, exhausted,
but* exultant, threw herself back in a
chair, and watched Edna gather up the
remains. of jthe lunch.
"Put the cakes . in - the tin, dearie.
They'll do for to-morrow, and be sure
and } cork the bottle . tight. There's
enough for another, time."
â¢ "Several other times," said Edna,
holding the bottle of port wine~up to the
light and squinting at it with ! er head
on one side. ' "It was a cheap party â
they hardly drank anything."
Mariposa and. her companion walked
up Sutter street with the lagging step
of people who find each other excellent
company. Â¦

add to her prestige.
She row fluttered about in a wrap
per, and with a piece of black net tied
tight over her forehead. Through this
the forms of dark circular curls out-
' lined themselves like silhouettes. Mrs.-
Willers had no warpaint on, and
though she looked a trifle warm, was
â¢ much more attractive in appearance
than when decorated with her pink and
while complexion and her spotted veil.
Edna, who was already dressed, was a
beautiful, fair-haired child of twelve.
.The struggles she had seen her mother
pass thrc-ugh. with her eyes bright and
her head high, had developed in her a
â¢ precocity of mind that had not spoiled
fhe sweet childishness of a charming
nature. It would be many years yet
Â¦before Edna would understand that
ehe had been the sheei-anchor of the
mother who was to her so clever and
so brave; the mother, who, in her mo
ments of weakness and temptation, had
â¢found her child the one rock to cling to
in the welter of life.
Mrs. \Tillers retired to the bedroom
to dress, occasionally coming to the
doorway in various stages of deshabille
50 give Instructions to the child. Her
toiipt was accomplished with mutilated
rites, and by the time the sacrificial
moment came of laying on the rouge
her cheeks were too flushed with ex
citement to need it. When she did ap
pear it would have been difficult to rec
ognize her as the woman of an hour
earlier. Even the black silhouettes had
.passed through a metamorphosis and
appeared as a fluff of careless curie.
The first guest to arrive was the man
ehe had epoken of as Essex. The ladles
at the windows below had been struck
into whispering surprise by his appear
ance. San Francisco was still enjoying
its or* final reputation as a land of
picturesque millionaires, who lived lives
nf lawlessness and splendor. Men of
position still wore soft felt hats and
buttoned themselves tight into Prince
Albert coats when they went down to
business in the morning. Perhaps In
the traveled circles, where the bonanza
kings and their associates lived after
. European models, there were men who
bore the stamp of metropolitan finish,
as Barry Essex did. But they did not
visit Sutter street boarding-houses nor
wear silk hats when they paid after
noon calls. San Francisco was still in
that stage when this form of headgear
was principally associated in its mind
with the men who drew teeth and
sold patent medicines on the sand lots
behind the City Hall.
Barry Essex, anywhere, would hare
been a striking figure. He was a hand
some man of some thirty years, tall
and spare, and with a dark, smooth
shaven face where the nose was high
and the eyes veiled and cold. He
looked like a person of high birth, and
. there were stories that he was, though
by the left hand. He spoke with an
English accent, and, when asked his
nationality, shrugged his shoulders, and
*aid it was hard to say what It was â
his father had been a Spaniard, his
mirther an Englishwoman, and he had
been born and reared In France.
That he was. a man of ability and
education, superior to the work he was
doing as specir.l writer on Jake Shack
leton's paper. The Trumpet, was obvi
ous. But San 'Francisco had become
bo used t<r mysteriously interesting
strangers. th2t come from no one
"knows where, and suggest an attrac
tively unconventional history, that the
particular curiosity excited by Essex
soon died, and he was merely of mo
â¢nie:it as the author of some excellent
articles on art,- literature and music in
The Sunday Trumpet.
He greeted Mrs. "Wlllers with a
friendly fellowship, then let a quick,
purrejÂ»titi<rus glance sweep the room.
Sh<? saw it. knew what he was looking
for. but affected unconsciousness. His
manner was touched by the slightest
suggestion of something elaborate and
theatrical, which, in Mrs. Willers' mind,
seemed to have some esoteric connec
tion with the silk hat. '-'his he now â
after slowly looking about for a safe
place of deposit â handed to Edna with
the careless remark: "Will you put
this down somewhere, Edna?"
The child took it, flushing slightly.
She was accustomed to being made
much of by her mother's guests, and
Essex's manner stung her little girl's
pride. But she put the hat on the
piano and retired to her corner, behind
the refreshment table.
A moment later she opened the door
to Jake Shackleton. Mrs. Willers, red
rh<*eked and triumphant, felt that this

laugh from her second guest He, too,

3From his first meeting with her, Bar
ry Essex had conceived a deep Interest
in Mariposa. He had known women of
many and divers sorts, and loved a
few after the manner of his kind, which
was to foster indolently a selfish ca- ,
price. Marriage was out of the ques
tion for him unless with money, and
some instinct, perhaps Inherited from
his romantic and deeply loving mother,
made this singularly repugnant to his
nature, which was neither sensitive
nor scrupulous. The mystery and haz
ard of life appealed to him, and to ex
change this for the dull monotony of a
rich marriage was an unbearably Irk
some ! thought to his unrestrained and
adventurous spirit.
Marlposa's charm had struck him
deeply. He had never before met that
combination of extreme simplicity of
character with the unconscious majesty
of appearance which marked the child
of the far West He saw her In that
Europe, which was his home, as a con
quering queen; and he thought proudly
of himself as the owner of such a
woman.; Moreover, he was certain that
her voice, properly trained and di-*
rected, would be a source of wealth.
She seemed to him the real vocal artist,
stupid In all but one great gift; in that,
pre-eminent.
Mariposa was trembling on the verge
of a first love. She had never seen any
one like Essex, and regarded him as the
most distinguished and brilliant of be
ings. ,Hl3 attentions flattered her as
she had never beeen flatttered before,
and she found herself constantly won
dering what he saw in a girl who must
appear to him so raw.
Her experience of men was small.
Once in Sacramento, when she was
eighteen, she had received an offer from
a young lawyer, and two years ago, in
Santa Barbara, she had been the re
cipient of a second, from a prosperous
rancher. Both had been refused with
out hesitation, and had left no mark

critical period of her life â lonely, poor.

fallen In with Essex, and for the first
time felt the thrill at the sound of a
footstep, the quickening pulse and
flushing cheek at the touch of a hand,
that she had read of in novels. She
thought that nobody had seen this; but
the eyes of the dangerous man under
whose spell she had fallen were watch-
Ing her with wary yet ardent Interest
He had known . her now for three
months and had seen her frequently.
His visits at the Pine-street cottage
were augmented by occasional meet-
Ings at Mrs. Wlllers', when that lady
was at home and receiving company,
and, by walks together. Of late, too,
he had asked her to go' to the theater

A GALA NIGHT.
CHAPTER IV.
â¢ "Oh, I'll tell you about her to-mor
row. It's a long story 'and I don't want
to be hurried over it" .
. He had made up his mind that he
would tell Bessie he had seen and in
tended to assist i his eldest child. He
had always been frank with her, and
he was not going to dissemble now. He
knew that with all her faults she was a
generous woman.
the remark would have been charming
ly plaintive â **I don't know what makes
him so.." :
"He can be more like a patent con
gealing ice-box when he wants to be
than anybody I ever saw. But I don't
see why he should be so to you."
"I don't either, but he is often. He
never says anything exactly disagree
able, but he. makes me feel sort ofâ ofâ
meant . Sometimes I think he doesn't
like me at all."
"Oh, ; bosh ! " said Latlmer gallantly;
"if that's the case he's ripe for a com
mission of lunacy."
: Shackleton meantime had entered the
.house and ascended to his dressing
room. He was In there making the
small change which marked his dinner
from his business toilet when his wife
entered.
The years had turned Bessie into a
buxom, j fine-looking matron, fashion
ably dressed, but Inclined to be very
.stout Her eye and its glance were
sharp and keen-edged, still alight with
, vigor and alertness. It was easy to see
why Jake Shackleton, the reader of
character, had set aside his feeble first
wife for thla dominating and forceful
partner. He had been faithful to her;
after a fashion had loved her, and cer
tainly admired her, for she had the
characteristics^ most respected.
In his success she had been the same
assistance . that she had hten in his
poverty. She had climbed' the social
heights and conquered the impregna
ble position they now occupied. Her
rich - dress, her handsome appearance,
her agreeably modulated voice, all
were in-keeping with the position and
great wealth that were theirs. The
house of which she. was the mistress
was . ordered and sumptu
ously furnished. She had only disap
pointed him in one wayâ her children.
"What made you late?" she, too,
.asked; "several people came down this
afternoon."
"I was detainedâ a girl Mrs. Wlllers
wanted me to see: who's here?"
"Latlmer and Count de Lamolle and
George Herron and the Thurston girls;
the Delanceys are coming over to
dinner."
He nodded at the names â Bessie
knew well how to arrange her parties.
The^ Thurstons were two impoverished
sisters of great beauty, and that proud
Southern stock of which early Califor
nia thought so highly and rewarded in
\most cases with poverty. Count de
Lamolle was a distinguished foreigner
that she- was considering for Maud.
The other two young men filled in
nicely. The Delanceys were a brother
and sister.iclaimants of. the great De
lancey grant which was now in litlga

by the marriage of their grandmother,
the Senorita Concepcion de Briones, in
1 '36, to the Yankee skipper Jeremiah
Delancey. ' /.';;' ;
/"Who was the girl Mrs. Willers
wanted you to see?" Bessie asked.
Back in his room the young man took
up his book again, but the thread of hla
Interest was broken. His mind refused
to return to the prescribed channels be
fore it, but began to drift here and
there on the wayward currents of
memory.
The house was now perfectly quiet
The little fire had fallen together into
a pleasant core of warmth that genial
ly diffused its heat through the room.
Essex, sprawling In his chair, his long
arms following Its arms, his finely
formed, loose-Jointed hands depending
over the rounded ends, let his dreaming
The man stopped, looking furtively at
him as If half expecting to be struck.
Essex turned toward the door and
passed out As he did so he heard him
mutter: "And I'd seen her ' before,
tOO." ,Â»;*.. '^
"Well, you'll see me again to-night if
you don't keep quiet, and this time you
won't like It."
"You was with a lady, a fine-looking
lady."
"Here â no more of that talk," said
Essex threateningly.
"Pardon, pardon!" said the other
humbly, "but I couldn't find the gas
this time. Doc. This is a small room,
but things do get away Bomehow."
He looked stupidly about with his
bleared eyes. The room was small and
miserably dirty and uninviting.
"There's a room," he said suddenly
In a loud, dramatic tone and with a
sweep of his arm, "for a man who
might have been a bonanza king!"
Essex turned to go.
"If you make any more of this row
to-night I'll see that you're turned out
to-morrow," he said haughtily.
He wheeled about on the drunkard as
he spoke. The man's sodden face was
lit with a flash of malevolent Intelli
gence, to be superseded immediately by
a wheedling smile.
"I seen you before to-day," be said.
The lodger's door opened, shut, and
there was silence. Essexâ a.n earnest
readerâ was soon deep in his book.
From this he waa Interrupted by a step
In Lae passage and a light knock on the
door. In response to his "Come in," the
door opened hesitantly, and the man
from across the hall thrust In his
head. It was a head of Mild gray hair,
with an old yellow face, eeamed and
shriveled beneath It The eyes, which
Â¦were beadily dark and set close to the
nose, were bloodshot, the lips slack and
uncertain. A very dirty hand was
curled round the edge of the door.
"Well, what is it?" said Essex.
"I've lost my matches agin," said the
man. in a whiningly apologetic tone.
"There are some," said Essex, desig
nating his box on the mantelpiece.
"'Take what you want."
The stranger shambled In, and after
scratching about the box with a trem
ulous hand, secured a bunch. Essex
looked at him with cynical interest He
was miserably dressed, dirty, and
ragged. He walked with an apologetic
slouch, as if continually expecting a
kick in the rear. He was evidently very
drunk, and the odor of the liquids he
had imbibed compassed him in an am
bulating reek.
"Thanks to you, Doc," he said, as he
vrent out. "So long."
A. few minutes later Essex heard a
cra*h from his neighbor's room, and
then exclamations of anger and dole.
These continuing with an increased vol
ume, Essex rose and went to the source
of sound. The room was pitch dark,
and from it, as from the entrance to
the cave of the damned, imprecations
and lamentations were issuing In a
etrenuous flood. With the match he
had brought he lit the gas, and turning
saw his late visitor holding by the foot

small stand, which had evidently been
surmounted by a nickel clock.
"What the devil do you mean, by
making such a noise?" he said angrily.

lady, oracularly.
It was nearly nine when Essex left
the restaurant, and passing down
Kearny street for a few blocks, turned
to his right and began to mount the
ascending sidewalk that led to his
lodgings. These were in a humble and
unfashionable neighborhood in Bush
street. The house was of a kind
whence gentility has departed. It
stood back on the top of two small ter
races, up which mounted two wooden
flights of stairs, one with a list to star
board so pronounced that Essex had,
once or twice, while ascending, thought
the city in the throes of an earthquake.
The darkness of night wrapped it
now. As it was early a light within
shone out dimly through two narrow
panes of glass flanking the hall door.
He let himself in and mounted a dirtily
carpeted stairway. The place smelled
evilly of old cooking and the smoke of
many and various cigarettes, cigars
and pipes. It was a man's roomlng
hpuse, and the men evidently smoked
where and what they listed. Essex had
no idea who they were and had seen
only one of them; a man on the same
floor with him who. he surmised, by
the occasional boisterousness* of his en
trances, frequently came home drunk.
His room was one of the best in the
house, on the front, and with a large
bay window commanding the street. It
was fairly comfortable and well fur
nished, and the draft of soft, chill air
that crossed it from the opened window
kept it fresh. Essex, after lighting the
gas in the pendent chandelier, bent
and lilndled the fixe laid in the grate.
Like many foreigners, he found San
Francisco cold, and after the manner
of his bringing up woulfl no more
have denied himself a fire/When he was
chilly than a glass of wine when he
was thirsty. Different nations have
their different extravagances, and Es
sex's French, boyhood had stamped him
with respect for the little comfort* of
that Intelligent race.
He pulled up an easy chair and sat
down In front of the small blaze, with
his hands out. Its warmth was pleas
ant, and hÂ» stayed thus, thinking. Pres
ently he smiled slightly, his ear having
caught the sounds of his fellow lodger's
6tumbling ascent of the stairs. The
man was evidently drunk again, and he
wondered vaguely how he ever man
aged to mount the terrace steps with
the list to starboard.
Now he stood on that margin. He
was thirty years old with shame and
bitterness behind him, and before -him
the dead monotony of a lifetime of
work. He hated It all. No memory
sustained him. The past was as sore
to dwell on as the future was sterile.
It was the parting of the ways. And
where they parted he saw Mariposa
During the long summer holidays
after that Antonio % Perez was only
there once over a Sunday. Then he did
not come again, and Barry was glad,
for he had never cared for his father.
He passed delightful days in the Tria
non Park with his mother, who was
very silent and had gray hair on her
temples. She walked beside him with
a slow step,, dragging her rich lace
skirts and with her parasol hanging In
dolently over her shoulder. It, pleased
him to see that many people looked at
her, but she took no notice of them.
When Barry went back to England to
school that year he began to feel that
he knew what was coming. .It came the.
next vacation. His mother had not
dared to tell him by letter. Her hus
band had deserted her and disappeared,
leaving her with a few thousand francs
in the bank and not a friend. â¢. ;
After that there were three misera
ble years when they lived In a little
apartment on the Rue de Sevres, up
four flights of stairs with a bonne a
tout faire. His mother had had to
conquer the extravagant habits of a
lifetime, and she did It ill. During the
last year of her life the sale of her
Jewels kept them. Barry was eighteen
when she died, and those long last
days when she lay on the sofa in the
remnants of the rich and splendid
clothes she found it so hard to do with
out were burned into his memory for
ever.
Their furnitureâ some of wljlch was
rare and handsome â brought them a
few hundred francs, and on this he
lived for another year, eking out his
substance with his first tentative at
tempt at journalism. When he was
twenty-one' he received a legal notice
that his father had died in Venezuela,
leaving him all he possessed, which,
debts paid and the estate settled,
amounted to about 910,000
This might have been a fortune to the
youth, but the bitter bread he had
eaten had soured the best in him. He
took his legacy and resolved to taste
of the Joy of life. For several years he
lived on the crest of j the wave, now
and then diverting himself with jour
nalism, the only profession that at
tracted him and one in which his tal
ents were readily recognized. He saw
much of the world and Its ways, living
in many cities and among many peo
ples. He tried to cut' himself off from
the past, adopting, after his mother's
death, her old stage name of Essex.
Then, his money spent, there had
been a dark Interval of bad luck and
despondency, when' Barry Essex, the
brilliant amateur Journalist, had fallen
out of the ranks of people that are seen
and talked about. Without means, he
sank to the level of a battered and
out-at-elbows Bohemian. There was a
year or two when he swung between
London and Paris, making money as
he could, and not always frequenting
creditable company. Then the tide
of change struck him and he went
to New Tork, worked there successfully
till once again the. Wanderlust carried
him farther afield.
He had now arrived at the crucial
point of his career. In his vagabond
past there many episodes best loft in
darkness, but nothing that stamped
him as an o'utcast by individual selec
tion. Shady things were behind him in
thatvdark. morose year when he found
disreputable company to his taste. But
he had never stepped quite outside the
pale. There had always been a mar
gin. ;? v
He remembered her far back In the
days when he sat oh her knee and was
read to out of fairy books. She had
been very pretty then and very happy,
and had always talked English^ with
him while every one else spoke French.
She had been an English woman, an ac
tress of beauty and promise, who in
the zenith of her popularity had made
what the world called a fine marriage
with a rich Venezuelan, who lived in
Paris. The stories of Essex's doubtful
paternity were, falfle. Rose Barry-
Rose Essex, on the stageâ had been the
lawful wife of Antonio Perez, and for.
ten years was the happy wife as well.
They were very prosperous In those
days, j Barry had gone to the lycee all
week and come back every Friday to
the beautiful apartment ln-the Rue de
Ponthieu. There were lovely spring
Sundays when they drove in the Bois
and sometimes got out ot the carriage
and walked down the sun-ftecked allees
under the budding trees. And there
were even lovelier winter Sundays when
they loitered along the boulevards in
the crisp, dear cold, with the sky
showing leaden gray through the bar
ring of black boughs, and when; they
came home to a parlor lit with fire and
lamplight and had oranges and hard
green grapes after dinner. ' /
He had loved his pretty mother de
votedly In those happy, days, but for
his saturnine, dark"-visaged father he
had. only a sentiment of uneasy fear.
He was twelve, when at his mother's
request he was sent to England to
school. He could remember, looking
back afterward, that his mother had
not been so pretty or so happy \hen.
When he came home from school for
vacations she was living at Versailles
in a little house that presented a se
cret, non-committal front to the stony
street, but that in the back had a de
lightful garden full of miniature foun
tains and summer-houses and grottoes.
From the wall he could see the mossy
trees and stretches of sun-bathed
sward of the Trianon. His father was
not always there when he came. One
Easter vacation he was not there at all,
and when he had asked his mother why
she had burst into sudden terrible tears
that frightened him.

As.he reached the house Maud and a
young man came round the corner and
approached, him. The girl was dressed
in a delicate and elaborate gown of
pale pink frilled with much '.' lace, and
with the glint of falling ribbons gleam
ing here and there. She carried a pink
rparaaol over her shoulder, and against
the background of variegated greens
her figure looked modish as a fashion
plate. It was a very becoming and ele
gant costume, and one in which most
young girls Would have looked their
best. / '. "Â¦Â¦â¢;> ...
Maud, who was not pretty, was the S
type of woman who looks least well in
handsome habiliments. Her Irremedi
able commonness seemed thrown into
higher prominence by . adornment. The
softly-tinted dress robbed her pale skin ,
of all glow and made her lifeless brown
hair look duller. She had a round, ex
pressionless face, prominent pale blue
eyes, and a chin that receded slightly.
She was not so plain as she was with
out: vivacity, Interest or sparkle , of,
youth. With her matter-of-fact man
ner, heavy figure, and large; unani
mated face she might have been forty
instead of twenty-one.
- She was somewhat laboriously co
quetting with her. companion, a. tall,
handsome young Southerner, -some six
or seven years her senior, whom her
father recognized as one of his supe
rior clerks : and shrewdly suspected of
matrimonial designs. At sight of her
parent a slight change passed over her
face. She smiled, but not so spontane
ously; her speech faltered, and she said,
coming awkwardly forward:
"Oh, Popper! you're late to-day; were
you delayed?"
"Evidently, considering I'm an hour
later than usual. Howdy, Latlmer;
glad to see you down."/
He stopped and looked at them with
the slightest inquiring .smile. Though

knowing him in different aspects, felt
he was not pleased. His whole person
ality seemed to radiate a cold antagon
ism.
"It's good you , got down anyhow,"
said Maud constrainedly; "this Is much
nicer than town. Isn't It, Mr. Latlmer?"
7 All the joy bad % been taken' out of
Latlmer by his chief's obvious and
somewhat terrifying displeasure. Had
he t been alone with Maud, he would
have known well how to respond to her
remark with â¢' Southern fervency of
phrase. But" now he only said with
stiff politeness: / ' .
"Oh, this is quite ideal!" and lapsed
into uncomfortable silence, j
"Was It some one Interesting that
made you late?" queried Maud, as her
father made no attempt to continue the
conversation.
"Very," he responded; "handsome
and interesting."
"Won't you tell us about them?" the
girl asked, feeling that the word
/'handsome" contained a covert allusion
to her own lack of beauty of which she
was extremely sensitive. .
â "Not now, and I don't think it would
Interest you much,' anyway. Is your
mother indoorb?"
The girl nodded and he turned away
and disappeared round the corner of
the house. She and Latlmer sauntered
Â¦ on.'; .; '. I ;
"The handsome and interesting per
son doesn't seem to have made your
paternal any fuller of the milk of hu

whose suit had progressed further than
: people . guessed.
. ''Popper's often like that," said Maud
slowlyâ and in a prettier and more at
tractive girl the tone 'and manner of
Satisfied pride was still seething in
him when he alighted from the train
and entered the waiting carriage. This
magnificent girl was worthy of him,
worthy of the millions that were really
hers. She had everything the; others
lackedâ beauty, charm, ' talents. Her
whole air, that \ regalness of' aspect
which sometimes curiously ' distin
guishes the simple women of the West,
appealed passionately to his /ambition
and love of success. She was born' to
conquer, to be a queen of men. ., The
image of Maud rose beside her, and
seemed clumsier and commoner than
ever. The father felt ( a slight move-
With stealthy persistence he followed
the steps of the peaceful couple -who
had it in their power to ruin him." Ser
enity began to come to him as he heard
that the union was singularly happy;
that Moreau, confident' no ' one would
molest them, bad gone through a cere
mony of marriage with Lucy, and that .
thevChlld was being brought' up as
their own.
As wealth came to Shackle ton he
thought of them with a sort of Jealous,
triumph. With his remarkable insight
into men he knew that Dan Moreau
would never make money; that he was
one of the world's predestined poor .
men. Then as riches grew and grew,
and the emigrant of the fifties became
the bonanza king of the seventies, he
wondered if the time might not ' come
when they would turn to him. ~ Â¦ â¢ â¢
He would have liked It, for under the
cold indifference of his manner the"
transaction at the cabin In the Sierra
forever haunted him with j its savage
shamelessnesss. It was the one debas
ing blot on a career which, hard, self
ish, often unprincipled, had yet never,
before or after, sunk to the level it
that base action. '
When Moreau died at Santa Barbara
Shackle ton heard it with a sense of re
lief. He was secretly becoming anxious
to see Ms child. Bessie' had borne him
two children, a boy and a girl, and It
was partly the disappointment in these
that made him desirous of seeing Mar
iposa. He knew and Bessie knew that
she ' was his Â¦ only legitimate'' child.
Though he had virtually entered Cali
fornia with but one wife, and the blot
of Mormonlsm had been wiped from his
record before he bad been two days In
the State, the rumor that he Had once
been a Mormon still carelessly passed'
from mouthy to mouth. l Should it ever
become known that there ' had been a
former wife, Bessie and her children
Â¦would have no lawful claim on him,
though the 'children, as acknowledged
and brought, up by him, would inherit
part of his estate. .-. '
With his great wealth the pride that
was one of the dominant characteris
tics of his hard and driving nature
grew apace. He had money by millions,
but no. .one , to do it credit. It would
have been the crowning delight of his
tumultuous .career to have a beautiful
daughter or talented son to grace the
luxury that surrounded him. But Bes
sie's, children were neither of these
things. They were dull and common

fection not grounded on 'admiration

sometimes in his exasperationâ for the
successful man bore disappointment ill
âwould say to himself:
"But they are not my. real children;
I have only one childâ Dan .Moreau's
daughter." â¢ ,
After the death of Moreau he learned
that Lucy and Mariposa were in San
Francisco. There he lost trace of them
and was forced to consult de
tective who had done work for him be
fore. It was an easy matter to -find
them, and only a few^etters passed be
tween him and the detective. In these
the man gave the address and financial
condition of the ladles, and added that
the daughter was said to be "a beauti
ful, estimable and .accomplished young
woman." This fired still further the
father's deeire to see her. He learned,
too, of their crippled means and it
pleased him to think that now they
might be dependent on him. But he
shrank with an unspeakable repug
nance from the thought of seeing Lucy
again, and he was for weeks trying to
find some way of meeting Itfaripoaa and
not meeting her mother. It was at
this stage that, purely by accident, he
learned that ilixs. Willers' daughter

good-by that afternooon at Mrs. Wil

As the train had whirled him over the
parched, thirsty country, burnt ; to a
drouth, he had no thought for anything
but his newly discovered daughter. His
glance dwelt unseeing on " the tanned
fields witbthelr belts of olive eucalyp
tus woods, and the turquoise blue of the
bay beyond the painted marsh. | Men
descending at way stations raised their
hats to him as they mounted into the
handsome carriages drawn up by the
platform. His return to their salutes
was a preoccupied nod. His mind was
full of his childâ his splendid 'daughter.
Jake Shaokleton had . not f orgottten
his first wife and child, as Dan Moreau
and Lucy had always hoped. He was a
man of many and secret interests, pull-
Ing many wires, following many trails.
He knew their movements and fortunes
from the period of their marriage in
Hangtown. At first this secret espion
age was due to fear of their betraying
him. He had begun to prosper shortly
after his entrance Into the State, and
with prosperity and the slackening of
the strain of the trip across the desert
came a realization of what he had done.
He saw quickly how the selling of his
wife would appeal to the California
mind, in those days fantastically chiv
alrous to women. He would be un
done.

In these Invitations, but was unable
to go. The theater was an untarnished
delight to Mariposa, and to refuse her
the joy of an evening spent there was
not In the mother's heart. Moreover,
Lucy, In her agony at the thought of
leaving the girl alone in the world,
watched Essex with a desperate anxi
ety trying to fathom his feelings. It
seemed to- the unworldly woman, that
this attractive gentleman might have
Wen sent by fate to be the husband
who was to love and guard the child
when the mother was gone.
' A few days after the party at Mrs.
Willers* rooms Essex had invited Mari
posa to go with him to a performance
af "II" Trovatore," to be given at "Wade's
Opera-house. The company, managed
by a French man called Lepine, was
one of those small foreign ones that in
those days toured the West to their
own profit and the pleasure of their
audiences. The star was advertised as
a French diva of European renown.
EssÂ«x had heard her on the Continent,
and pronounced her well worth hearing,
If rather too fat to be satisfying to the
esthetic demands of the part of Leo
nora. Grand opera was still something
of a rarity In San Francisco and It
promised to be an occasion. The pa
pers printed the names of those who
had bought boxes. Mariposa had read
that evening that Jacob Shackleton
would occupy the left-hand proscenium
box with his wife and family.
"His daughter," said Mariposa, stand-
Ing in front of the glass as she put on
finishing touches, "Is ugly, Mrs. Willers
says. I think that's the way it ought
to be. It wouldn't be fair to be an
heiress and handsome."
"It wouldn't be fair for you to be an
heiress, certainly," commented the
mother from her armchair. ,
"You don't think I abuse the privi
lege a penniless girl has of being good
looking?" said Mariposa, turning from
the glass with a twinkling eye.
She looked her best and knew It.
Relics of better days lingered in the
bureau drawers and Jewel boxes of
these ladies as they did in the small
parlor. That night they had been mus
tered in their might for Mariposa's
decking. She- was proud In the con
sciousness that the dress of fine black
lace she wore, through the meshes of
which her statuesque arms and neck
gleamed like ivory, was made from a
shawl that In its day had been a costly
possession. Her throat was bare, the
lace leaving It fnee and closing below It.
Where the black edges came together
over the white skin a small brooch of
diamonds was fastened. Below the rim
of her hat, her hair glowed like copper,
and the coloring of her lips and cheeks
was deepened by excitement into vary
ing shades of coral.
As they entered the theater, Essex
was aware that many heads were
turned in their direction. But Mari
posa was too Imbued with the Joyous
unusualness of the moment to notice it.
She had forgotten herself entirely, and
sitting af little forward, her lips parted,
surveyed the rustling and fast-filling
house.
The glow of the days of Comstock
glory was still in the air. San Fran
cisco was still the city of gold and sil
ver. The bonanza kings had not left
it, but were trying to accommodate
themselves to the palaces they were
rearing with their loose millions. So
ciety yet retained Its
tone, careless, brilliant, and unconven
tional. There were figures in it that
had made it famous â men who began
life with a pick and shovel and ended
It In an orgy of luxury; women, whose
habits of early poverty dropped from
them like a garment, and who. carried
away by their power, displayed the bar
baric caprices of Roman empresses.
The sudden possession of wealth had
intoxicated this people, lifting them
from the level of the commonplace into
a saturnalia of extravagance. Poverty,
the only restraint many of them had
ever felt, was gone. Money had made
them lawless, whimsical, bizarre. It
had developed all-conquering personal
ities, potent individualities. They were
still playing with it,- wondering at it,
throwing it about.
Essex let his glance roam over the
audience, that filled the parquet, and
the three horseshoes above it. IJ struck
him as being more Latin than Ameri
can. That foreignness which has al
ways clung to California was curious
ly pronounced in this gathering of va
ried classes. He saw many faces with
the ebon hair and olive skins of the
Spanish Californians, lovely womsn,
languid and fawn-eyed, badly dressed
âfor they were almost all poor now,
who once were lords of the soli.
The great Southern element which. In
Its day, set the tone of the city and
contributed much to Its traditions of
birth and breeding, was already falling
into the background. Many of Its
women had only their beauty left, and
this they had adorned, as Mariposa had
hers, with such remnants of the days
when Plancus was consul, as remained
âbits of Jewelry, old and unmodlsh * :
cumbrously handsome, edgings of i . 9.
a pale-colored feather In an old hat, a
crape shawl worn with an air, a strlr
of beads carried bravely, though beai
*. a re no longer In the mode.
Essex raised his glass from the rÂ»~
rusal of the sea of faces, to the bo
whlch the Shackleton party had Jt3t
entered. There was no question ab'ut
the Americanism of this group, thÂ»
young man thought, aa he stared at
Jake Shackleton.
The two ladles in the front of the hox
were Mrs. and Miss Shackleton. The
former was floridly handsome, almost
aristocratic, the gazer thought, looking
at her firmly modeled, composed far a
under its roll of gray hair. The daugh
ter was very like her father, but ugly.
Even in the costly French costume Bhe
wore, with the gleam of diamonds in
her hair, about her neck. In the lace
on her bosom, , she was ugly. Essex,
with the thought of marrying money In
the background of his mind, scruti
nized her. To rectify his fortune in
such a way became more repugnant
than ever. If Mariposa had only been
Jake Shackle ton's daughter instead!

The ring Is an ordinary gold one
fitted with a ball at the back.' It Is
filled by pressing the ball nearly flat
and dipping the ring , Into a cup of
scent, when the elasticity of the ball
draws the perfume Into the Interior
till auite full.,. By the least pressure
the wearer of the ring can cause a
Jet of scent to shed its refreshing
aroma any moment he pleases, and he
may thus act as. a benefactor or a
nuisance to, those in his vicinity.
The perfume lamp may also be used
as another pleasant method of disin
fecting a room. A ball', of spongy
platinum is placed over the center. of
the wick, afld is fixed In its* position
by a thin glass rod, which Is inserted
Into the wick. The lamp Is then filled
with any scented spirit, and when
lighted Is * allowed to burn until the
platinum gets ) red hot. The flame is
then blown out, and a pleasant odor
fills the atmosphere..

is well known, and the "scented dandy"

than his detractors give him credit for.
It Is he who Is trying to revive the
use of the perfumed fountain ring, an

Â¦^^S^jmati David Rankin of
Tarkio, Mo., the owner, of fourteen
ranches, including more .than 22,000
acres of as fine black soil as the sun
ever shone on.
Mr. Rankin is the largest stock feed
er in the world. He buys more corn
than any other farmer In the United
States, and most of It is fed to stock
on his farms. Besides the extensive
farming operations, Mr. Rankin is in
terested in many ojher enterprises. In
appearance he is a typical farmer. He
is 6 feet 2 Inches tall and weighs 180
pounds. Each day he rides over his
farms and gives orders to his fore
men. He frequently stops on the, way
to assist in* pulling a steer out of . a
mud hole or to build a shed to protect
a fat porker from the rays of the hot
sun. â¢ He is as familiar with the men
employed on his farms as a housewife
Is with her domestic duties. :'\

to Mr. Rankin on the 5th of each

The examination of the final state
ments of . the year 1902 showed that a
total of 7539 head- of cattle had been
sold. They brought the Sum of $172,520.
The number of hogs â¢ sold 'was 8249, for
which the sum of $111,846 V H was re
ceived.^
The total clearance of his operations
during 1900 was more than $100,000. This
was his most prosperous year. During
the month of July the teams and men
cultivate an average of a thousand
acres of corn a day. They use the
double row riding cultivator. This plow
Is a ; disk concern, so arranged as to
plow the ground ' on both sides of a
row of corn. One man can plow ' from
twenty to twenty-five acres a day with
one of them. They are 'easy on both

Mr. Rankin gave as a donation $50,000
to the United Presbyterian College at
Tarklo. This is one of the leading col
leges of the State. He Is a believer In
higher education of the masses and
that churches and schools are , the' twa
potent factors which have brought thÂ«
American people up to the high stand
ard which they have attained. .
The following tabulated statement of
his operations during the last = year

graphical names are pronounced by
Japanese -with little accent, as a rule.
The vowel* are spoken broadly â "a" as
"ah.." "e" as long "e." "i" as short "e,"
"o" generally as "o," but sometimes as
"aw," and "u" ai "oo."
Here are some of the Japanese names
most frequently met with In the war

Tokyoâ Toa-kyoh.
Nagasakiâ Nah-gah-sah-kee.
Hakodateâ Hah-ko-dah-teh.
Kagoshima â Kah - go - she - man, a
flight accent on last syllable.
Bhlmonoseklâ She-mon-o-say-kee.
Fukuoko â Kwoo-o-kah.
S&sabo â SaM-say-bo.
Hiroshimaâ He - ro - she - mah. (The
affix, "Ehlma," f*~equently found In Jap

"He-ro-lsland."
Tokushimaâ To-koo-she-mah, "to" as
â¢tow" in "towboat."
Takaokaâ Tah-kah-oh-ka.
Nanao â Nah-nah-oh.
Tsurugaâ T6oo-roo-gah.
Nilgata â Nzhe - zhe - gah - tah, the

Osakaâ Oh-sah-kah.
Shikokuâ She-ko-koo.
Klushuâ Kyu-shoo, .the first "u"
given its full sound.
In many respects Korean and Chi
nese names are pronounced after the
same rules as Japanese, although
many have a decided accent on the

such results, however, it was neces

The spiral is especially suitable f6r

stormy weather.
Fish, too, are verv weatherwlse. Cod

cod were caught off the shores of New

gale, and it was found that all of them

some of which weighed three or four

Sea urchins always try to wriggle

while dolphins never sport or toss

When a cat washes her Jaws with

Dogs always know when it is going

is well to remember that rain will in

"Begun at the bottom of the ladder,

"Doc says If I'm faithful to the win
dows and the brass knobs I may rise
to be gardener. You'll kindly observe
my occupation is useful."
She made no reply, but walked
down the avenue, the angry color
mounting her cheeks. That evening
she received a note.
"Dear Ethek I've thrown up my
job. You didn't seem to favor it. I
shall try another useful one. Yours,
"F. B."
The nature of the new Job disclosed
Itself two mornings later. Ethel was
in the kitchen giving some Instructions
to the cook, when who should appear
at the back door but Brigham, whlta

and whistling irrepressibly.
"Good morning," he said. "This Is*
perhaps, somewhat more useful than

"Doubtless," said Ethel coldly.
"Not so bad. either," he went QQ
recklessly. "Meet ldts of nice gtrt*.

from the kitchen.

Some days later she encountered him
again. She had been out to the Coun
try Club with young Martin that after
noon, and it was dusk when they
alighted from the suburban train. ?*
they hurried along the platform a
familiar voice said: "Kerridge, mum?"
It was Frederick, decked in the lrr
ery of old Sam, the Brighams* coach
man.
"Made four seventy-five to-day," h*
chuckled gleefully.
Her face grew tense.
".When is this ridiculous burlesque
to end?" she inquired in a strained
voice, and without waiting for his re
ply she hurried after Martin.
The climax came one late February
afternoon. Ethel had left the cross
town car at the corner and was hurry
ing up the avent^. When she reached
St. Botolph's, she saw quite a crowd
standing on the sidewalk staring up
ward. She, too, looked up. A light
ning-rod ran up the brownstone spire,
and on the lightning-rod, slowly, pain
fully working his way upward, was a
man. She turned away with a little
shiver of horror, but as she did so, a
well-dressed man beside her cried ex
citedly:
"By George! It's.BrIgham â Freddy
Brigham."
She stopped, sick with dread, yet
she could not keep her eyes from that
black dot on the spire. She saw him
creep up to the very apex; saw him
climb the rod that supported the
weather vane. There he drew from
somewhere a hammer, cleared %he
snow from the vane, and with sevevil
blows of the hammer set it free â¢p
swing to the wind. Then he came
down the rod to the bell deck and dis
appeared through a trapdoor, while
the crowd cheered.
Ethel, giddy with the strain of the
last few minutes, entered the church.
In the vestibule she saw Brigham and
the sexton, who was handing him
some bills.
"Hello!" called the former, catching
sight of hex. "It was really useful.
Vane snowen up, you know, and peo
ple in the vicinity couldn't tell which
way the wind was blowing. Did you
want to see the sexton?" he added
pointedly, whereat that functionary
discreetly took his leave.
"Frederick .Brigham!" she began
bravely, but suddenly the tears came
and she began to sob. He watched
her covertly for n moment and finally
decided to risk an arm about her.
"Perhaps I'm useful, after all/* he
suggested.
"You are! Oh, you are!" she said
"To'yon?" he hinted -

"I think you have no cause to com
plain of defective hearing," she said
stiffly.
"You don't mean what you have Just
said?" he asserted.
"I .most certainly do mean it," she
averred. *
"I never doubted for a moment you
would marrv me," said he. "I always
supposedâ"
"Suppositions are not sureties." she
informed him.
"Ethel," he said coaxlngly, "this has
gone far enough as a Joke. It's get
ting to the point where it hurts."
"I'm sorry it hurts, but it isn't a
joke, Frederick," she said.
i He stared at her in amazement and
rumpled his hair thoughtfully, with one
hand. . , ' ?
- "I'm a pretty steady-going sort," he
said, half i to himself. "Don't drink to
excess; .allow myself but three cigars
a day; and never play over a ten-cent
limit. , It can't be money, either â '*
"No, it's not money,", she said.
"Must be I'm stupid, then." #
"If you were stupid," she said, "I
think, . perhaps, . I might forgive you^
"I confess I'm in the dark," he said.
"Kindly show me the vulnerable point
in my armor of virtue."
"You have everything , in the world
to live for," she said severely. "You
start life with a big handicap in your
favor; but all your qualities are nega
tive. You don't do anything."
"Pretty clever with a boat," he re
minded, her. "Play a fair came of
poloâ"
"Anything useful?" I she hastened to
amend. -
"I see." he said, and. for several mo
ments gazed abstractedly . at the-cell
ing. "I'd like to take exceptions to
: your last statement," he said at length. '
"It seems to me I am doing the most
useful thing in the world for a man in
my position. I have plenty of money,
' and instead of crowding out some poor
duffer who really needs that commod
ity, I keep out . of ; it and give him a
show."
Her eyes flashed. "What a lame
excuse," she said.
. "May be a trifle spavined," he
agreed cheerfully.
"I was going to say it was coward
ly,", she said.
"Oh, well, if it's that, I'll Join the
'doers' at once," he drawled. "Let's

. of rust by this. time."
"There are other fields." she re
; minded him.
He rose and stood before her, look
ing down at her flushed face.
"If -I do something useful â some
thing really useful, do I win?" he said
tensely.
"Yes," she said, studying the toe of
her shoe. . . . . .
"Very well, then," he affirmed.
., "You'd better decide whether It's Italy
or Southern California. Good-by."
A moment later the- outer door
" banged and the usefulness of Freder

again, and then . it was quite . by acci

nue one morning, and when she had
reached Dr. Lawrence's house a well
' known voice called. "Hello. < Ethel!"
Â¦ She turned,. but he was not. behind
her; : then she looked t up and beheld
, him standing: on the ledge outside Â¦ a
second-story window. He was clad In
faded blue overalls, and in one. hand
. ' There had been questions, a thump-
Ing of back and. chest with the sur
geon's little hammer, and divers appli
cations of the stethoscope. Then the
activity was relaxed, and the bluff old
doctor, who. had known and liked
Stewart for years,- delivered himself:
"You're a sick man, captain; sicker
than you know. Lobe of the right
lung's affected. It. isn't consumption,
yet, but it will be if you don't get out
of that infernal Michigan climate.
Stay up there three months, and you're
sure of a nice military funeral. Go to
New Mexico or Arizona for a year, and
you'll die some time, but it'll be of old

The pallor on Captain Stewart's cheek
deepened a trifle. "I have a cousin down
in the Oscura Mountains, New Mexico,
keeping: books for a. mining company.' ' I
could go there," be said, quietly. Be

fights his way up from a foundling's
crib, through successive stages of news
boy, farm laborer, and college student
to a place at the bar of his country,
misfortunes mildly amuse.
Back of the smile Captain Stewart
admitted, however, that matters were
Â¦serious enough. Plowing through
bottomless roads and bivouacking In
rain-soaked fields did not seem to be
as good fun as they 6hould. The cap

morning troop trains had pulled up to
the platforms, received their burdens
of humanity and skirting the placid
Ohio, pulied away through the green
and gold of the Muldraugh Hills-
Bound for Louisville and the north.
The First Battalion, Fifth Michigan -
Infantry, consisting of four companies
of stalwart khaki clad fellows from the
interior towns of the State, swarmed
on to their train right willingly. Now,
e.s the wheels slowly revolved, the men
in the tourist sleepers waved cheerful
good-bys to the soldiers still lining the
tracks. They sang, too â smile-compel
ling doggerel on the depth and sticki
ness of Kentucky mud, or on the pro,
fane uncertainty of their re-enlistment
as guardsmen.
Back in the Pullman the dozen offi
cers of the battalion were little quieter
in demonstrating their satisfaction.
SV.ord belts were unbuckled and flung
aside, service blouses and campaign
hats stacked in vacant sections. Sand
wiches were shared indiscriminately
Â£.niong the members of the happy
group.
Now, to be in love, even when too
much money on one side and too much
pride on the other offer no obstacles,
is a sufficiently uncertain and heart
trying b'usiness. Something within him
dragged the unwilling Stewart to the
Madison home about once in three,
weeks. Being unable to forget the bar
rier between them, Stewart devoured'
the girl with his eyes, and came away
affer his glimpse of paradise, cursing'
himself for a fool. He was a different'
sort of caller than most, Marjorie dis- :
covered, and as an antidote to the' hun- 
ger of Stewart's glances she talked ar-'
rant nonsense to him. "If she; were'
only poor," Stewart groaned in secret
daily. After each visit he decided . to Â¦
avoid Marjorie and strangle the temp- 1
tation, ever growing stronger, to speak,
the words of love which. rushed to his
lips. j :
Callahan appeared on the scene. three
weeks , before the Kentucky ; encamp
ment. Callahan had curly blonde hair,*
almost as much money as Marjorie's '
father and limitless audacity. He was
the Junior member of a Northern Mich-
igan lumber firm and came to Water-
ville as manager of a branch office.
He straightway paid court to Miss
Madison in a fashion that bid fair to
distance all rivals. He was constantly
at her side. Stewart still made his
periodical visits, and between him and ;
the blonde Callahan grew "up a deep
antipathy. Marjorie watched both and
smiled. Which she favored no one
could discover.! Stewart went to Ken
tucky with his- pride, rejoicing that it
was not to be humbled â nay, smothered
â beneath the Madison millions, but his
heart was heavy as lead. . Callahan was
certainly making progress.
"Alone to New Mexico," the car
wheels clicked unceasingly in Stewart's
cars as the troop-train plunged north
ward. "It's all off with me now,, if , I
ever had a chance." he mused bitterly.
"I guess 'out of sighC out of mind,'
applies to-day as. much as ever it did.
She'll ' marry Callahan inside of six
months. But it's just as well : : no one
will say. that John Stewart is a fortune
hunter"; which . was strictly " true,
though of little- " assistance In stilling
the outcry, of an aching heart.
mighty pride, liad fallen hopelessly in
love with Marjorie Madison, heiress of
millions and courted assiduously by
crafty fortune hunters, young and old.
Stewart loved her not for her money,
but in spite of it. Marjorie became sin
gularly interested in the clear-eyed
young lawyer with his wealth of' quiet
humor.
"The very thing!" replied the other,
enthusiastically. "We'll be back to
Waterville Sunday; set away for the
south Monday â not a minute later, for
every day counts now. Keep out of
doors down there. Get a job herding
cattle or driving stage. Work hard, live
in a tent and sleep on the ground.
Why. it'll be only a vacation for"' you!"
So Captain Stewart went back to
quarters, his decree of banishment
hanging over him. He had no fear, for
he felt the doctor spoke truly; a year
beneath the balmy southern skies
would cure him. The affair of the lungs
did not bother; but the affair of the
heart! That was another story.
There was a girlâ "there always is"â
Stewart told himself grimly, as the
train bore him northward next day,
and he smiled cynically at his own posi
tion. "From every standpoint it's the
best thing possible for me that I'm go
ing. I suppose it's human nature to be
contrary, though, and no exile ever felt
worse over leaving home than I do."

by a thunderbolt, and following that
his Â«ifeÂ£ h.id died and he had fallen
and broken his leg. There could be
only one more calamity in store for

Bessie !n and raid:
â¢Wei!, it has come. Old John Doan

man of business."
r.essie Thompson was a girl of 20.
In addition to being good looking and
having a good education her acquaint
ances called her a "brick." They said
so because she had faced misfortune
v.ith a braver heart than her father
and had displayed a level head and
much shrewdness in trying to stem
the tido and extricate him from his
unfortunate situation. She had even
taken a trip of fifty miles to see old
John Doan in person and try to soften
his heart, but had only found his agent
and been gruffly told that her father
must pay ud or go. She had expected
the blow anfi her answer to her father
was:
"Well, if we can't pay we'll have
to go. of course, but we shall be al
lowed a few weeks' grace, and who
knows what may happen In % that
time?"
Something did happen, but it came
about in a queer way. Two weeks
had passed and Miss Bessie had start
ed to make soft soap in a big kettle
In the back yard. Farmer folks would
make soft soap in the spring even
"Yes. I know, but it wasn't about
the soap. Young woman, when you
have anything on hand, attend to it
and let castle-building alone. Thinking
won't bring bread and butTer." .
Miss Bessie walkad down to Tthe fire
and rearranged it a bit, and then laid
a stick across the top of the kettle to
prevent another accident. While she
was doing this the old man sat dc/wn
on* the steps with a srunt and looked
around and muttered to himself. Pres
ently he called to her:
"Young wo/nan, is your father at
work anywheres about the farm?"
"No. fir. Father is in bed with a
brc-ken leg."
"I 'edosc lie was doing some fool
thing when he broke it?"
"He was drawing; up wood last Feb

"Urn. Where's your mother?"
"Urn. Who runs the farm?"
"I'm doing my best to care for things.

"It seems to me that a. girl of your
age ought to know enough to put: a

you've got lye to throw away, or you
had rather think of marrying some

"I â I was thinking " she stam

the front gate and passed around the
house. He was decently dressed, but
he was bowbacked and lame, and his

natipri. : ' Our history contains no
'parallel that exhibits such a record of
rapid advancement by means of the
concomitance of so many eventful
accidents.
Leupp gives an ingenious explanation
for the singular reticence the late Sen
ator Hanna always exhibited when
asked whether he Intended running for
the' "Presidency this year and the ap
parently coquettish way In which he
seemed to enjoy the idea of his pos
sible nomination. According to Leupp,
"No one well acquainted with Senator
HannaV- personality was deceived as
to.^where he stood. He was not of the
Presidential mold. The Senate suited
his taste and his powers. He wanted a
free hard. He hated Infinitesimal
worries.' â¢ He lacked the patience nec
essary to deal with all sorts of men
at once as a .master and as a suppli
cant. He loveFfl authority more than
insignia. He would rather administer
the affairs of the nation in the name
of another than let others administer
them in his name. Nature had marked
him for a kingmaker â not a king.
V * * There probably was never
a moment when he felt the slightest
temptation to enter the lists for the
nomination, but neither was there a
momtsnt '} when he would have been
-.wilting; .to forego the power to award
it'-tO.somV one else. If Republican or
ganizations'anywhere saw fit to name
Roosevelt as: their choice, why should
he put obstacles in their way? He was
entirely friendly with Roosevelt and
looked to see him nominated; he would
not accept the nomination himself if
It were offered t him, and he did not
expect It to be offered; but to go into
the convention with a large following
at his 'back and prevent a bad mistake
if it threatened, would be a great sat
isfaction." â¢ â¢â¢
Roosevelt's love of sports and ath
letics, his family life, his religious tol
erance, his interpretation of the Mon
roe doctrine, the Booker Washington
incident and many other h a PPenlngs of
his administration which, have had
either a political significance or the
mere .worth of anecdote, are recited by
the, author- in a clear and entertaining
manner.
On reading this book one cannot help
but enjoy It, no matter What his po
litical convictions, may. be. In truth
it is a bold and an unprecedented ac
tion on the part of the publishers to
bring' out a work upon a:man who Is
yet living and whose, political career
is still in the making, yet the reputa
tion of the publishing house and the %
sincerity of the author should be,
enough to scout the idea that in this
work there is anything which could
be construed Into an attempt to fur
nish material for a political campaign.
Whether or r.ot Roosevelt becomes the
next President, there is enough of
mark in the man to warrant the pub
lication of an intimate view of him.

Historic Lives Beries and. uppears
at a most opportune moment. Mr.
L'e'upp Is editor of the New York Even
ing Post. He has been privileged to
enjoy the almost .life-long friendship
of the President;,'' .This. intimacy with
the subject of his work has enabled
him to publish a large amount of val
uable Information regarding the. Pres
ident, his political and public actions,
that has not hitherto been; 4 knqwn.;
This, combined with his attractive lit
erary style, developed during his vlong
years of "labor on the New. York press,
has assisted him to carry out his de
sign "to give Americans of the rank
and file a lltle more yivld impression
of the American at the front, and to
bring them closer to him, so that,
without losing their perspective view
of the leader, they could see more of
the man."
The book opens with a reference to
the right good ludk and extraordinary
series of fortunate accidents that
raised Roosevelt from the -position, of
an obscure politician to the highest of
fice In the land. ; As Is well known,
he did not gain the Presidency 'like
many of his illustrious predecessors by
force of mental ability alone; for as
Leupp says, "Roosevelt is not r a genius.
He is a man of no extraordinary, nat
ural' capacity. As author, lawmaker,
administrator, huntsman,, athlete, sol
dier what you will, his record contains
nothing that might not have been ac
complished by any man of sound
physique and good intelligence. Such
Vrestige as he enjoys' above his fellov.-s
he has acquired partly by hard work
and partly bv using his native wit in
his choice of tasks, and his method of
tackling them." Accidents gave him
his opportunities and positions; -his
good sense in choosing his advisers
and hjs strict attention to the Injunc
tion of his favorite motto, "When in
doubt what to do, go ahead," have en
abled him successfully to carry out
the multitudinous tasks allotted him, Â¦
Throughout his life Roosevelt . has
found that wherever he has worked
for a position to the best of:hls abll-'
Ity and failed, some power has inter
vened to turn defeat into a surprising
success. It is clearly seen now that had
he gained the Mayoralty of New York
in 1886, as he dearly wished t*o do, he
would have been content with civic
honors, probably, and would have
kept too far away j from Federal poli-_
tics to have had ambition to become. a"
candidate for the position of Assistant
Secretary* of State under President
Harrison. He worked hard for this po
sition and failed; but was awarded a
civil service commissionshlp. In this
office he gained considerable publicity,
which, was afterward increased on his
appointment to the palfce commission
in New York City. This office paved
the wav for -him to the Assistant. Sec
retaryship of the Navv. On the decla

A Powerful Novel
of Paris Commune
17OVBI.S of Paris smiling are
/W always Interesting; novels of
A v Paris in the thunder fit of revolu
tion are ever enthralling:. â¢ So it is that
a story far less better written than Dr.
William Barry's "The Dayspring"
would be accepted with eagerness. Dr.
Barry's novel deals -with the tinsel
days of Napoleon "the Little" and the
sudden .blackness and madness of the
Commune.. Robert Chambers' book,
"Ashes of Rmpire," Svhicti had such a
wide vogue a few years ago, turned the
rich opportunities of Paris' last revolu
tion to account in no more telling a
manner than does this* latest romance
of those troublous times. Dr. Barry's
story is thrilling enough 'to satisfy the
tastes of any devotee of Erclcinann-
Chatrain.
The plot onens with the hasty flight
from England to France of Henry
Guiron, an Irish lad who has murdered
his hard-hearted landlord and seeks to
escape the consequences of his crime
in the purlieus of Paris. Opportunely
befriended by a young Frenchman for
whom he had once done a service,
young Guiron â an alias, of course
finds himself among friends when once
in Paris and the chapter of his ad
ventures begins. Cast into kindly
places by being made the secretary of
an Englishman who is, rather strange
ly, deeply concerned in French politics,
the refugee ha? an opportunity to
profit by his native Celtic wit and ready
address to the extent of becoming an
accepted member of a very select lit
tle salon, over which there presides
Madame Kingswood. ' This throws his
fate under the same favoring star as
that of la Comtesse de Alontalis, a
beautiful and romantic young widow
whose time is divided between deck
ing her late husband's grave with lil
ies and consulting a necromancer and
modern Casanova, Hiram Temple . by
name.
Against the sinister and all-pervad
ing power of this charlatan spirit co.n
juror the hero finds him.self set. Tem
ple has succeeded in gaining such an
ascendency over the credulous ladies
of Mme. Kingwood's salcn, especially
the romantic widow, that Gulrori finds
ji combination of circumstances, dic
tated and arranged by the necroman
cer, forcing him into a dishonorable
position. In despair he rushes out
from all this gay and rose-colored life
to lose himself in the slums of the
great city in pursuit of a new-found
zeal for the cause of the Socialists, j It
Is in the unfolding of the hero's wild
enthusiasm for the propaganda of rev
olution, his association with the hare
brained fanatics and journalists of the
red flag, his garret conspiracies and
secret meetings with the "mlserables"
that the author does his best work.
The terrible, seething pot of sedition
and anarchy which boUed under the
fragile throne of Louis Napoleon, the
mutterings of a distant holocaust to
throne and state', the blind fury of the
Reds lamenting everything on to hoped
for destruction â these elements of grim
portent introduced into the story give
It a quickening thrill.
With the general crash of everything
In the horror of the Commune the
story draws to a close. Vindicated of
the stain of dishonor falsely imputed
to him, triumphant over Temple, his
enemy, an,d heroically outlined by. the
flres of the Tuileries before the eyes of
his lady, Guiron wins the heart of the
fair and romantic Comtesse and the
cooling ashes of Paris are sifted upon
the last page of the 8tory.\
Admirable in the main as Dr. Barry's
story is, it admits of criticism on two
points. His Introduction of the ele
ment of the occult through the spirit
medium, Hiram- Temple, weakens the
plot by Just the measure that it fails
to win the credulity of the reader. Th*
occult should either be the absorbing
feature of a storyâ so persistent as ef
fectually to put the reader under, the
power eo that the least should be great
est, irrespective, of its effect, the pe
culiar system of land tenure â these
were the Ills brought on by the Quaker
principles <if William Penn. according
to Buefl.
"He accomplished nothing." says the
author in reference to Penn's second
vrsidonce in Pennsylvania, "except to
demonstrate further â had further
demonstration been neededâ the futility
Â«>f trying to ndapt the doctrines of John
Saitmarsh to the problems of popular
self-government. He found that, no
matter how beautiful his theories of
universal toleration and unrestricted
suffrage, he practicall- had to deal with
an -Established Church in fact if not in
name. :â¢*Â¦Â».â¢ The Established
Quakerism of Pennsylvania was in the
air, spiritual, elusive to the sight; im
palpable to the touch and irresponsible
to itself or anybody else; but still an
establishment, capable of thwarting
everything, though incapable "of cre
ating anything."
Throughout the whole of his biog
raphy, even in tliose parts wherein
Penn does not appear in the unclouded
glory which beats about the throne of
greatness. Mr. Buell sustains, above all
else, the quality of honesty, cardinal in
a biographer. His effort has been to
show William Penn the man only
through the works of William Penn
the founder of new empire and ruler of
men. His biography is more historical
than intimately personal. It is every
where well written and of an absorb
ing interest.

Of a far different sort of a man than
William Penn, the gentle Quaker, does
Harriet Cooper have to write in "her
biography of Jamfes Oglethorpe, found
er and first Governor of the royal col
ony of Georgia. Each a builder of the
new empire across seas, each, an or
ganizer, legislator and executive of
rare ability, the supreme difference be
tween ihe two lay in this: Penn, the
man of peace, had the desire for push
ing back the frontier softened by the
gentleness of religion; Oglethorpe, the
warrior, was ever ready to carve out
a larger destiny for his colony by the
sword blade. _'-,.";. Â¦'
This biography, one of the Appleton's
Historic Lives Series, is not so pre
tentious as the work' mentioned in the
foregoing; this partly because of the
purposely elemental nature' of all the
works in this series and partly on
account of the necessary restrictions
placed upon the scope of the work by
the comparative meagerness of original
sources. With no detraction from the
credit due the author, be it said that
her work is more a compilation from
and condensation of ajl authorities
than the attempt at any original re
search. Here again the character of
the Historic Lives Seriesâ designed as
it is to give first glimpses at little
known charactersâ prohibits in a large
measure any deeper treatment.
One- of the most interesting passages
in the author's book is that describing
the conception of the Georgian project
in the mind of Oglethorpe and the car
rying into execution by himself and
others of the scheme of philanthropy
of which was born the new colony. It
is a fault which should be remedied
that the first impression of Georgia
colony gained by young America from
his school history is that of a penal
settlement, an early Botany Bay, in
fact, where dangerous criminals from
the purlieus of London were shipped in
chains. The biographer clearly points
out in her opening chapters the fact
that Oglethorpe's design for the coloni
zation of Georgia was purely a phil
anthropic measure far In advance of
the humanitarian thought of the time,
and directed solely to the betterment
of those unfortunates imprisoned for
debt. No convicts or desperate char
acters were allowed to embark for
Georgia. The colonization was open not
only to the debt-ridden English, but to
the persecuted Protestants of Europe.
The hardships of the first settlers at
Savannah, the incursions of the In
dians, wars with the Spaniards, the
mutterings of a new stirring of liberty
and the final overthrow of the royal
governmentâ these scenes, in which
Oglethorpe played an active part, are
detailed clearly and completely by the
author. When she has completed her
work the result -is a brief, correct and
lively account of the part one man
played in laying the foundation of the
republic.

The Lives of Two
Colonial Builders
y y â¢ ITHIN the last two or three
B B 1 years there has been a grow-
ing literary movement in
this country which augurs
veil for the ever green memories of the
eitrly fathers! that is. the writing and
ready reading of biographies whose
subjects are the men of mark in colon
ial and revolutionary days. Until re
cent years the only fund of biography
which was open to thu student of
American history, and the casual read
er as well, wes that Eupplied by the
scholarly but often too voluminous
writings of the biographers of fifty or
seventy-five years ago. Though satis
fying; enough to the close student or
the assiduc-ug reader, these old writing*
are not of the kind which can merit
the term jwpular.
It is the advent, then, of the popular
biography which has produced a dis
tinct revival in this somewhat neglect
ed branch Â«_f standard literature. To
the list of there newly written biogra
phies there has Just been added those
of two colony builders, "William Penn"
by Augustus C. Iiucll, and "James
Oglethorie," frum the pen of Harriet C.
Cooper.
. In essaying a life of William Per.n.
Bufil has not selected a task without
its difficulties. There have been Penn
biographers since the time when the
Proprietary of Pennsylvania laid do*wn
the burden <-f a long life in 1718. Many
of them have been Quakers, whose
adulation hots partaken so much of the
character -.t' saint worship as* to be
hardly acceptable as authority. Others
thf-re have been whose works have
smacked so much of the Puritan that
the sting of bias has prohibited an un
prejudiced account of the life and
works of the great Friend. With -an
honest determination to steer the
straight path between this Scylla of
bias and Charbydls ef blffbtry, this
bi6^raplur has written a life note
worthy for clearness of outline and
fidelity to accepted facts.
The author is manifestly very "chary
of any phase of his subject which may
demand statements able to be cun
etrued ' into controversial. With the
best of intentions he states in the open
ing paragraphs of his bo-jk just what
he ho^>es to do and what he will cere
fully eschew. "The character of Wil-
Hain Pern presents three sides." says
he. "the political, the commercial and
the religious. With the -last mentioned
aspect the writer possesses neither the
capacity nor the inclination to deal. It
is his purpose to view Penn as an
aeent and promoter of secular civiliza
tion in its broadest sense, and therefore
his religious character reed not be in
troduced except as it may from time
to time become incidental as a key."
This is a worthy purpuse on thÂ«Â± part
of ihe biographer, for theoretically, at
least, its pursuance would free the
writer from the entangling meshes of
possible religious contention, but as*
well try to dissociate Washington
from his statecraft or Franklin from
bis learning as Pern from his Quaker
ism. The biographer finds early in his
work that a life of William Penn, shorn
of his religious convictions and their
influence upon his character and life
uork, would be but a distorted reflec
tion, indeed. So, reluctant though he
may be to do so. Buell has made the
constant influence of the teachings of
George F:>x upon the Proprietary of
Pennsylvania one of the keynotes of his
work. Properly is it donÂ«s for the in
spiration of the colony in the New
World sprang from the Quaker heart
of Friend Penn, two of the most impor
tant articles in its code of government
were the direct inspirations of Quaker
teaching, and the troubles which
heaped upon Penn and his colony dur
ing the first years of his rule were the
Ingical results of Quaker principles ap
plied to government.
Prefacing his accounts of Penn's
conversion to the Quaker sect
with an admirable review of the relig
ious Hellespont which churned and
boiled in all England during Cromwell-
Jan domination, the author propounds
a somewhat ingenious theory to ac
count for the fact of young Penn's
apostasy. From the seeming coinci
dences of the boy's having heard one
Thomas Loe preach the tenets of the
Friends twice in Dublin and once near
his home in London, Buell draws the
deduction that George Fox, founder or
the sect, had deliberately "set" Loe
nn to young Penn with malice afore
thought in order that the new church
might have a convert from the no
bility. This speculation of the author's
lacks any documentary confirmation
and is not altogether a worthy one to
be uttered.

the persecuted Quakers which led up
to his conception of the proprietary

the new Pennsylvania charter is not as

army and the loss of a province. Tes.
monsieur, what Abercombie and 5000
men had done upon the beach at Abou
kir was undone by me, single-handed,
in a hackney coach in Harley street.
"Well, I had no time to lose, for at
any moment Monsieur Otto might be
down. I shouted to my driver, gave
him his second guinea and allowed him
to proceed to Watier's. For myself, I
sprang Into our embassy carriage and
a moment later the door of the Minis
ter opened. He had himself escorted
Monsieur Otto downstairs and now so
deep was he In talk that he walked out
bareheaded as far aa the carriage. As
he stood there by the open door there
came the rattle of wheels and a man
rushed down the pavement. .'
" *A dispatch of great importance for
Milord Hawkesbury!' he crierf.,
"I could see that it was nit my mes
senger, but a second one. Milord
Hawkesbury caught the paper from
his hand and re^d it by the light of the
carriage lamp. His face, monsieur,
was as white as this plate before he
had finished.
" 'Monsieur Otto," he cried, 'we have
signed this treaty upon a false under
standing. Egypt is in our hands."
?? "What!* cried Monsieur Otto. 'Im
possible!*' _â¢ :
â¢â¢ 'it is certain. It fell to Abercrom
bie last month.*
â¢â¢ 'In that case,* said Monsieur Otto,
it Is very fortunate that the treaty 13
signed.*
" "Very fortunate for you, sir.* cried
Milord Hawkesbury. and he Â¦ turned
back to the house."
"Next day,- monsieur, what they call
the Bow street runners were after me,
but they could not run across salt wa
ter and Alphonse Lacour was receiving
the congratulations of Monsieur Tal
leyrand and the First Consul before
ever his pursuers had got as far â
"I know that I am to blame, but I
could not help glancing at the letter,
picking it out of the senseless hand
of Monsieur Otto. My God! the thun
derbolt that it was! I did not faint, but
I sat down beside my chief and I burst
into tears. It was but a few words, but
they told us that Egypt had been evac
uated by our troops a month before.
AH our treaty was undone then, and
the one consideration which had in
duced our enemies to give iis good
terms had vanished. In twelve hours
It would not have mattered. But now
the treaty was not yet signed. We
not consent to evacuate Egypt,' and In
this way we quickly brought him to
reason.
"Well, it was upon the 1st of October
that the treaty was finally. to be signed.
In the morning I was congratulating
Monsieur Otto upon the happy conclu
Â«lon of his labors. He was a little pale
shrimp of a man, very quick and nerv
ous, and he was so delighted now at
his own success that he could not sit
Â¦till, but ran about the room chattering
and laughing, while I sat on a cushion
in the corner, as I had learned to do in
the East. Suddenly in came a messen
ger with a letter which had been for
warded from Paris, Monsieur Otto cast
his eyes upon it, and then without a
word his knees 'gave way and he fell
senseless upon the floor. I ran to him,
as did the courier, and between us we
carried him to the sofa. He might have
been dead from his appearance, but I
could still feel his heart thrilling be
neath my palm.
" 'What is this, then?* I asked.
" 'I do not know,' answered. the mes
senger. 'Monsieur Talleyrand told me
to hurry as never man hurried before,
and to put this letter into the hands of
Monsieur Otto. I was in Paris at mid
night yesterday.'
"Well, Monsieur Otto, our Embas
sador, was kept terribly busy over
that treaty and all of his staff were
worked to death.
"You can understand that it was
no child's play. After ten years of
war each nation had got hold of a
great deal which had belonged to the
other, or to the other allies. What
was to bÂ« given back? And what was
to be kept? Is this island worth that
peninsula? If we do this at Venice,
will you do that at Sierra Leone? If
we give up Egypt to the Sultan, will
vou restore the Cape of Good Hope,
which you have taken from our allies
the Dutch? So we wrangled and
wrestled; and I have seen Monsieur
Otto come. back to the embassy so ex
hausted that his secretary and I had
to help him from his carriage to his
sofa. But at last things adjusted
themselves, and the night came round
when the treaty was to be finally
dgned.
"Now you must know that the one
Â«Â»eat card which we held, and which
we played, played, played at every
ipoint of the fame, was that we had

,vous about our being there. It gave

iwire that that wonderful little Xapol

of an advance against India. So
(Whenever Lord Hawkesbury proposed
â¢to retain anything, we had only to
reply, *In that case, of courÂ«*Â». we can-
"You must know, monsieur," he
Â¦would say, "that I left Egypt after
Klebtr'e assassination. I gladly would
have stayed on, for I was engaged in
a translation of the Koran, and be
tween ourselves I had thoughts at the
time of embracing Mahometanism, for'
I was deeply struck by the wisdom
of their views about marriage. They
had made an incredible mistake, how
ever, upon the subject of wine, and
this was what the Lufti who attempt
ed to convert me could never get over.
Then when old Kleber died and Menou
came to the tnp I felt that it. was time
for me to go. I carried my Koran and
my papers to London, where Monsieur
Otto had been sent by the First Con
sul to arrange a treaty of peace, for
both nations were very weary of the
war, which had already lasted ten
years. Here I was most useful to Mon
sieur Otto on account of my knowledge
of the English tongue, and also. . if I
may say so, on account of my natural
capacity.
Of all his stories none was more no
torious than that . of thÂ« Koran and
the Foreign Office messenger. And yet
when Monsieur Otto's memoirs were
written it was found that there really
was tome foundation for old Lacour's
incredible statement.
THERE are " many folk who
knew Alphonse Lacour in his
old age. From about the time of
the Revolution of '48 until he
filed In the second year of the Crimean
War he was always to be found in the
lama corner of the Cafe de Provence,
at the end of the Rue St. Honore, com
ing down about 9 In the evening and
going when he could flnd no one to talk
with. It took some self-restraint -. to
listen to the old diplomatist, for his
rtories were beyond all belief, and yet
he was quick at detecting the shadow
of a smile or the slightest little rais
ing of the eyebrows.

"So, I stood outside Milord. Hawkes
bury's house, and you can think how
often my eyes went up to that window
in the hope of seeing the candle twinkle
in It. Five minutes passed, and another,
five. Oh, how slowly they crept along!
I paced up and down, slapping my
hands to keep them warm, and still
straining my ears. . And then suddenly
out of the dull hum of the traffic down
in Oxford street I heard a sound de
tach itself, and grow Ipuder and louder,
and clearer and clearer with every in
stant, until two yellow lights v came
flashing through the fog, and a light
cabriolet whirled up to the door of the
Foreign Minister. . It had not stopped
before a young. fellow. sprang^ out of.it
and hurried to the steps, while the
" 'Courage!' I cried; and then, a sud
den thought coming into my. head,
'How do we know that the English will
have news of this? Perhaps they may
sign the treaty before they know of it.*
"Monsieur Otto sprang from the sofa
and flung himself into my arms.
. " 'Alphonse,* he cried, 'you \ have
saved, me! "Why should they know
about It? _ Our news has come from
Toulon to * Paris, and thence straight
to London. Theirs will come by sea
through the Stralta^of Gibraltar. At
this moment It is unlikely that any one
in Paris knows of it, save only Talley
rand and the First Consul. If we keep
our secret we may still get our treaty
signed.*
"Ah, monsieur, you can imagine the
horrible uncertainty in which we spent
the day. Never, never shall I forget
those Blow hours during which we sat
together, starting at every distant
shout, Ifest it should be the first sign
of the rejoicing which this news would
cause v in London, Monsieur Otto
passed from youth to age in a day. As
for me, I find it easier to go out and
meet danger than to wait for it. I set
forth, therefore, toward evening* I
wandered here and wandered there. I
was in the;fencing rooms of Monsieur
Angelo and in the salon-de-boxe of
Monsieur Jackson and in the club of
Brooks and in the lobby of the Cham
ber of Deputies, but nowhere did I hear
any news. Still, it was possible that
Milord Hawkesbury had received
it himself just.' as we had. v He
lived in Harley street, and there it was
that the treaty was to*be finally signed

Otto to drink two*glass^s of Burgundy
before he went, 'for I* feared lest his
haggard face and tremb"Un.g.- hands
should rouse suspicion [' itx : the English
Minister.
"Well, we went round together! in one
of the embassy's carriages, about J: 30.
Monsieur Otto went in alone; but pres
ently, on excuse of getting his .port
folio, he came out again, â¢ with.;his
cheeks flushed with Joy, to tell me thstt
all was well.
" 'He knows nothing,' he i whispered.:
'Ah, if the next half hour were over!' r
"'Give me a sign when it' is settled,*

" 'For -what reason?*
" 'Because until then no messenger
shall interrupt you. I give you my

house, while I was left waiting beside
the carriage. . Â«/V
. "Well, if we could but secure- our
selves from interruption for a single
half-hour the day would.be our own.
I had hardly begun to form my plans
when I saw the lights of a- carriage
coming swiftly from the direction of

alarmed me rattled safely past me.,

be prepared. Above all,; I must, not

the famous artist who came all . the
way across the continent just to paint
her picture declare.!- "all heaven is in

simplicity of dress on all occasions is
at once an example and a rebuke of
th<Â» folly of overdressing children.
And this is how thÂ£ great honor above
mentioned ceme. all unheralded â¢ and
unsought by either Mistress Margaret
or her parents, to whom, indeed, â¢ the
publicity that has grown out of the
attractiveness of their little daughter
is very distasteful and annoying from
the Treat number of pec-ple who have
been drawn by curloÂ«Jty and admira
tion to their little East Oakland home
and the innumerable letters that have
been written "asking about her. ,
"Recently." said the photographer
attracted by the appearance of little
Margaret C. Moist. She sat directly op
posite to me and was accompanied by
who made these, "while traveling In a
Southern Pacific : train between this
city and Oakland, my attention was
her mother. I noted the artistic out
lines of her form and features, but what
chiefly impressed me was the unstudied
grace of her attitudes and the vivid ex
pression of the emotions reflected in her
face. Introducing myself to the moth
er, I arranged with her to bring. the lit
tle girl to my studio to be photographed.
I took her in six different poses at one
sitting, and. the pictures have since
been universally admired . by all who
have seen them.".
And it was this set of photographs,
the "best of which are reproduced here
with, that was sent to the Ladies' Home
Journal to be entered in its big baby
competition by one of little Miss Moist* s
most ardent admirers. The parents re
ceived their first intimation that their
baby had won a prize when Walter
Russell arrived at their house to paint
a full-sized picture of Miss Margaret.
according to the rules of the competi
tion.
Moreover he brought with him the as
tounding information that she had been
selected as one of twelve from over
13.000 little American children. Just
think of thatâ 18.000! It is a truly re
markable number to be pitted against
In a country that is world-famous for
its beautiful children. And yet. with
the single exception of Marie Octavla
Fischer of Seattle, whose picture was
also originally taken for and printed
In The Sunday Call and which will be
reproduced In multiple next Sunday,
little Mistress Moist was the only child
in the entire Pacific States that won a
prize. And the prize -itself Is a mag
nificent painting by Mr. Russell, who Is
considered one of the best artists on
children's portraiture in the wqrld.
And that Baby Moist is a little artist
in her own way may be gathered from
Mr. Russell's enthusiasm over her. He
said: "rT '"">*.," Â¦'Â¦..,.'Â¦.."
"In making my decision for the baby
contest I had not the slightest doubt
of the remarkable beauty of the child,
because the posea were so clear and
logical and artistic. Had It not been
for their excellence X would not have
bad the pleasure of spending a. happy
week with the little Ctrl, nor would the
painting ever have been made."
As a matter of fact, the artist foond
her even more beautiful In the va
riety of her moods and expression than
It is possible to show in a photograph,
and for that reason carried away with
him a great number of sketches and*
minute studies, the best of which when
finally finished a few months from now
will be printed and the beautiful copies
spread broadcast.

The Eton shirt waists are cut' in ele
gant fashion, with' little lace boleros
and Uttle lace-trimmed Etons if ailing
While the entire tendency is toward
complete suits, there Is no doubt that
the shirt waist plays a prominent part
in these suits,.. and by a little clever
work the woman. who wants a variety
can secure it by studying the shirt
waist market a-nd taking advantage of
her opportunities.

the waist she will apply small violets,

the real Irish weave or the imitation,
and this she will convert into an
Easter blouse.
Another stock was in white taffeta
stitched In green with the stitchery tub
proof. And still another was in white,
with two stitched tabs of white wash
silk In front, with coral red stitchery
and coral red knots dotting the tabs.
The making of the stock alone csn
stitutes a very nice summer fancy
work and creates a bit of hand indus

ornamental.
From the appearance of the shop
windows it Is time to put in a supply
of shirt waists and the woman who
does so early will secure the newest de
signs.
In a convent ths patient sisters sat
stitching upon a waist of delicate blue
linen. The pattern upon -which they
were -working was one designed by an
artistic sister. It showed a great spl
derweb of blue silk, in which a large
gray spider was struggling. The spider
was round and fat and was made en
tirely of embroidery threads. The web
was repeated in smaller size upon the
cuffs and upon the stock. To wear
with this there was a very pretty Eton
made of lace with a deep collar bound
In silk, the whole falling open In front
to display the delicately woven web.
The stocks are as interesting as the
waists themselves this season, for
they, too, display many new modes. A
stock of white silk had a big silver
buckle In front And through thi3
buckle there was drawn wide ends of
scarlet taffeta, three Inches -wide,
hemmed upon each edge and the whole
abundantly stitched in red silk. These
ends were pulled through the buckle in
such a way as to look like a great bow

together with gray predominating, then

Don't try to make your shirt waists
for dfessy wear all out of one material,
for Dame Fashion says there shall be
two or. three and that there shall also
be two or three colors as well &s ma
terials. It, is more economical to com
bine the materials as well as more
fashionable, and so the home dress
maker can perform the feat known as
killing two birds with one stone.
One of the> handsomest waists is
made in sharp contrast. There 13 a
wonderful waist of white lace which 13
trimmed with very beautiful pipings of
crange. These are in the shape of
fat little folds which are laid around
the lace of the sleeve midway ur> the
p.rm and along the yoke. The stock Is
outlined with them and there is a
crushed orange velvet belt.
. White Waists Made Dressy.
White waists are made very elegant
by the woman who will take a little
trouble to fix them up. One white
waist, after it came home from the
laundry, for it was a wash shirt waist,
was trimmed with buttons covered with
gray suede. They were very large and
were set in rows of two down the front
of the waist, down the sleeve and ar
ranged upon the yoke. Then there was
a" wide, suede belt and a suede stock.
Very large buttons, covered with
Japanese silk, are used to trim waists
and some of the handsomest lace waist,
effects are accomplished by placing
these buttons upon the waist in dou
ble-breasted fashion or in a single row
running down the right of the waist
and trimming the cuffs and stock.
Qrnate buttons of all kinds are em
ployed upon shirt waists to the great
benefit of the waists, for there is some
thing that is almost Jewel-like in the
new buttons. .-'-â¢Â£,,
Squares of turquoise, with a shank
underneath, are used In button fashion
and sauares of red stone, of green, of
topaz pink and of every color and kind
which one associates with the real
- gems are also used.
Mother of uearl has come out very
strong and there are mother of pearl
buttons with tiny Jewels in the center
which go .very well with shirt waists
of gray and of blue. Don't, if you are
an amateur dressmaker, attempt to
make up a handsome shirt waist with
out due regard for the button fad which
has swept across the land and invaded
the strongholds of fashion.
The covering of button molds Is
something .for the fingers of the in
dustrious girl of spring. Many of
them are covered with canvas which
is worked in cros3 stitch in bright col
ors. Covering button molds with can
vas and afterward' working them la
plenty of fun for the girl with artis
tic tastes. They can be worked in
Armenian designs, or in the old fash
ioned cross stitch which made the
samplers of a generation ago so very
pretty.
If the designs are intricate the can
vas is worked before the button molds
are covered, but In the painted but
tons and those that are done In a
great cros3 stitchery right in the mid
dle of the button, it is better to cover
the molds and do the fancy work
later..;

The Philosophy of Shirt Waists.
The shirt waist fever, which was
thought to have abated somewhat,
ha* broken out afresh and in a form
which threatens destruction, not only
to the pocketbook. but to- the eye
eight. Where shirt waists were made
by machine before they are now all
hand stitched, and the tucking, the
shirring, the stitched bands, the strap
pings and the pipings are all laid in
by hand, where once they were all, or
partly, done by machine.
The introduction of the shirt waist
and Its universal adoption by women
means a great deal, not only in the
line of expenditure, but In the line of
saving as well. For, while a woman
can waste a great deal of money upon
shirt waists, she can also save a great
deaL Where she once was compelled
to spend a goodly sum of money to
obtain a new suit, she can now get one
at a very reasonable figure by taking
advantage of the opportunities offered
her in the shirt waist line.

y T was on the Rue Saint Honore!
IThe pretty American girl hesitated,
came to a full stop, turned and en
tered!
When she emerged, fully an
hour later, her face wore the expression
of a woman who had been dazzled by
line clothes. She had purchased a chirl
waist of linen, so fine that you could
have twisted it into a roll no bigger
ihan your finger and she had ordered
5t embroidered with violets. Each vio-
Jet was to have petals of glossy silk
Kith the finest of openwork surround
ing each flower. The price wasâ well,
never mind the cries!
American shirt waists are the fad
of the hour in Paris. The French, who
caught on eo slowly, to our shirt waist
idea, have now taken it up with avidity
and the American shirt waists, made in
France, are emong the most delightful
of all articles of wearing apparel. They
fit around the neck an,d shoulders, for
no woman is as critical as the Ameri
can woman in this respect, and. they
set neatly around the belt and waist.
And to these sterling qualities the
French have added the exQuisite detail
for which they are famous. The French
shirt waists show the wonderful em
broidery of the convents and they ex
hibit the peculiar artistic qualities for
which the French are bo well known.
A waist made of softest lawn had
the entire yoke peppered with French
knots. The lower edge of the yoke was
bordered with fringe, deep, soft, white,

to wash like a pocket handkerchief. Set

were oblong figures of Irish lace, each
figure surrounded by violet hued stitch
ery. with French knots surrounding
each figure.

HAND MADE
SHIRT WAISTS FOR
SPRINGâ¢
The son of a solicitor in South Lon
don, Thomas had some private means
of his own and devoted his time to
â¢the study of anarchism and â clocks.
Attaching himself to a socialist club,
, near Greenwich, he becam. an a: t pupil
* in that "school of thought" â or
thoughtlessness â and when, after the
murder of President Carnot. In Paris,
his . ccssor refused to commute the
death sentence passed on the murderer,
Thomas determined to strike a blow at
all governments (by way of reprisal)
and dropped a pennyworth of gun
powder into the letter-box of an Inof
fensive postmaster In Greenwich.
There was little or no damage done
and the whole thing would have been
forgotten in a week. But this did not
suit Thomas. He wanted to be famous
and he thought that, his whifT of gun
powder had made him so.
Finding that little noise was made
about this exploit, he wrote a letter to
the postmaster bidding defiance to all
constituted authority and, as a result,
he was arrested and tried, under the
1HAVE met with some very strange
characters behind prison bars.
Some were philosophers, some
were fools, or "mostly fools" â but
those whom I have now in my mind's
eye were marked by special "peculiari
ties" which marked them off from their
fellows.
One such rara avis was Thomas Râ ,
now undergoing a sentence of seven
years' penal servitude for what some
thought, at the time, was but a foolish
freak and others a grave criminal of
fense.
"You ar2 thick- headed. No. 43.
Were you not so you could see things
as they are. I am a dangerous politi
cal prisoner and a sworn, enemy: of
all governments. The cabinet would
like to kill me If they could do so de
cently; but instead of sending )>ne of
their assassins into my cell to mur

die of starvation by withholding food
that- 1 could eat and forcing on me
what they know J can* tÂ« eat. But I
am not going . to"die -until'? I' ; strike 'a
blow at Downing 'street * that will
shake the empire. V ; .\
Another remarkable, \ character, still
behind the 'â¢ bars,'- Is? the, man^ Bonson,
who is serving five, years In j connection
Â¦with a* Stock : Exchange -swindled He * is
a wealthy man,) ahti \ his one Idea fwhen
I knew him was that his riches would
I tried to impress the plain fact
upon him that he was starving him

at any price and, with a contemptu
ous sneer at my stupidity, wound, up
the conversation with this tremendous
pronouncement: . -.^'-.n-
tion into another channel, and know
ing that Thomas returned his dinners
to the kitchen daily untouched, I ask
ed him why he didn't eat his meat
and soup. Â¦ .
"Never eat meat nor drank soup
in my life."
"But why? Are you a vegetarian?"
rXo, but I nev-er did eat meat and,
as they won't give me anything in
place of my dinners, which, I always
send back, it Is evident that the auth
orities are starving me."
As every one acquainted with legal
life* knows,- there ; are " veryT'of ten "com

There were ' several â¢ other "moneyed
men" behind the bars at Parkhurst in
my' time, and,, short of liberty, they
couldâ some of them didâ buy anything
they took a fancy to (in a quiet, clan
destine way, of course). '
One such man, was^ Saker, the junior
member -of a firm of solicitors Â» well
known, In Lincoln's Inn. . ,
. Unlike Bonson, Saker was an Israel
ite who had no guile! Simplicity was
his . distinctive Â¦ mark . and peculiarity;
and it was. always a -puzzle to me, how
such a man could have been guilty of
the fraud on acount of which he Is now
undergoing ten years' penal^ servitude.
The mystery was cleared up . one day
when ; Sakerâ who ;then ; had : charge of
the workshop In which I was employed
âgave me a brief history 'of , his case.
' Saker was the' victim of'circum
stances.- The* firm, of which hie was ju
nior-member, became Involved in very
serious ; difficulties, ; and r the ; Incorpo
rated Law .Society took up ] the matter.
Saker, although atrich^matf and' but
recently t married, offered to take all re
sponsibility, under certain '.conditions,
and. he was arrested on a charge of
fraud. . I4Â» VC< .
The arrangement was agreed. upon
and. next day, Saker was placed in the
Old Bailey dock before the 'Recorder.
Â¦ .To the surprise of every one in court
and, especially, of . Saker himself, -Sir
Charles Hall rose from the bench and,
seeming to remember suddenly an Im
portant engagement -elsewhere, he ad
journed' the court until the; following
morning. â¢ ,
One result of this unexpected incident
was that Saker's case was transferred
to "No/ 2" court. Not wishing to de
part from the arrangements made with
his partners, he pleaded "Guilty" to the
charges arid, ;to his dismay, was sen
tenced to ten years' penal Servitude by
a Judge-known to be particularly se
vere in dealing, with - fraudulent solici
tors. , .
Saker made several attempts to have
the " case \ reopened, "Â¦ but ' as there is : as
yet no court of criminal appeal In this
country, he spends h:o days and nights
vainly looking ; out, from behind the
bars of Parkhurst Â¦ Prison, . for some
thing to "turn-up" which may ; deliver
him from the cage wherein â¢ he~has al
ready passed four years.
From '\ beh I nd the 'â¢ bars of the same
cage'another remarkable.conyict is also
looking 'out,- but with eyes /directed,
not; toward 'the new law-courts, but to-;

he was visited by the heads of the firm
and received an- assurance that the
case would be put on the list of :the
then Recorder (the Mate Sir Charles
Hall), and that if he pleaded guilty he
would get off with a very light sen
tence. â¢
"explosives act," for, this outrage on
the letter-box. He was found "guilty"
and Mr. Justice Bruce sentenced him to
seven years' penal servitude.
I chanced to be one o? a \ batch of
nine prisoners who were transferred
from Chelmsford Gaol to Parkhurst
convict prison in June, 18 â , and, when
we entered the train at Waterloo, I
found that Thomas was my vis-a-vis.
He was in a communicative mood;
and, as the rules of discipline are some
what relaxed on such occasions, we had
a lengthy conversation on the Journey
between Waterloo and Southampton.
Thomas had, somehow, got it into his
mind that he was a "political" prisoner
and not a common felon; and one of the
first things he asked me was "what
the papers had to say" about his doings.
He was. evidently, under the Impres
sion that the whole of England, from
Lands End to John O'Groats, was ring
ing with the letter-box fiasco, whereas,
so far as I knew, not a single paper had
made the least comment upon It. V- Â«
To all appearance, Thomas was of
sound intellect; he could converse co
herently and, : indeed, learnedly on
most subjects, and altogether he made
a rather favorable impression at this
first Interview.
We had not been in Parkhurst many
days before" Thomas proved himself
to be a "crackpot." I met him. one
morning on the exercise ground, and
the following dialogue might have
been fcteard by any one standing within
a few yards of us.
Coming behind me he whispered:
"I say, No. 4 3," isn't â¢ this /a. beastly
place ? I would like to blow, the whole
prison up, ; Governor, arid all." . .
I was anxious to turn the conversa-

Grayson. He is an American by birth.
a speculator by. profession and (so he
asserts) a convict by a miscarriage of
justice. The master of six or seven
languages, Grayson uses only one â the
vernacularâ and that mainly to blas
pheme.
He disclaims all intention or desire to
conform to the rules and regulations of
the prison and will have nothing to do
with ."class", distinctions, which (he de
clares) he could not recognize/ since to
do so would be to acknowledge the jus
tice of his sentence.
Moreover, Grayson carries his ideas
of resistance so far that, now and
again, he takes it Into his head to re
fuse his prison food, and on * one occa
sion he abstained for a whole week
from either. eating or drinking, with
the result that he had to be admitted
into the hospital and put upon special
diet to keep him alive.
His particular fad was to sue the
treasury for. false Imprisonment, and, as
he Is undergoing seven years â every day.
of which he will have to serve (having
forfeited â¢ all "remission marks") â and
will claim two-sixths per diem for the
whole of that time, he intends to pro

had secured the rights to- extend her
Trans-Siberian road to the south and
through Manchuria to Tachichao, near
Mukden. In her diplomacy she planned
that- one - branch should . run to Port
Arthur and Dalny and another toward
Shanhaikwan, where the great wall
of China touches the sea. Whether or
not* China realized the immense power
that she was giving her enemy is not
known, but the fact remains just the
"same* that* the "Russians gained great
influence in North China and that her
entrance' is unrestricted, so that she
may come and go as she seesflt.
Dalny, which, .by . the way, means
"far. away" in the Russian language,
is one of, if not the most, characteristic
of the Russian cities andj while It Is a
long way from its mother city, St.
Petersburg, it owes !ts existence to the
iron will of the Russian Emperor, who
caused it to be built irt-e single day,
as It were, as a port "to be opened to
the fleets of all nations." What the
Czar wanted was a sort of an outer
gateway that could be used at all
seasons and all times and, with his
usual style of appropriating things, he
got It. In 1891, he laid the first stone In
what is known as his "Great Siberian
Railway" | and he "made it his business
to see that it was finished at an aston-
der that the provinces might be more
easily opened up for traffic and when
China actually began putting In a

Notwithstanding her army and the
Russian towns and ways that were
springing up here, there and every
where like wild flowers in the spring,
the route to her new domains was a
deadly long and tiresome one, as over
2200 miles of land and water had .to
be traveled over. ; s I ,'â¢â¢Â¦
And then, just as she was commenc
ing to plot and plan for newer con
quests, Japan stepped into the fray
and materially -isted her. The
Japs in a moment of rage decided to
humble the pride ot the almond-eyed
Celestial and by so doing they gave
Russia an opportunity to lease Port
Arthur as a naval station, and Id and
behold both feet were firmly planted
on a new territory and the land of
the Czar laughed silently but long in
its sleeve.
The army of the Czar is mostly
composed of two classes, the common
peasant and the Cossacks of the Don,
and the largest jjart of those in Man
churia are trusted Cossacks, although
the term Cossack has been used so
much and so often that it has come to
mean any Russian sent into a new
section or country on account of trou
ble. - -v-
untii there are in Mancnuria to-day
fully 1.400.000 people and the number
is increasing at a fast and furious rate.
No matter what mischief I^isaia. may
be getting into or how many fingers she
may be getting in China's pie, the fact
remains just the same that she Is open
ing up new markets, and as a result
business should take great strides for-.
ward and the results should be amaz
ingly good. For all of which the Czar
sits and chuckles, for he knows better
than any one else that his new Russia
has provided both himself and tha
world in general a wide-open door
through which all may sail as often as
they see fit.
There Is one thing lacking In Dalny
that has caused comment, and that is
the utter absence of military protec
tion. Uudoubtedly Russia thinks she
doesn't need it, as it is but forty
mlles^away from Port Arthur, which is
fairly alive with guns and filled to Its
utmost capacity with well trained sol
diers, as, in fact, is every new town
and harbor in Manchuria.
Here she opens her doors freely and
invites those who care to stay to
come in and buy and own their own
property, and she even extends a wel
come to 'Jews, while the Chinese are
regarded in a more friendly light and
mix more freely with the foreigners
than In any other part of the earth,
which naturally is making and quick
ly spreading a kindly feeling between
the two nations. In all things the
Emperor is following out a carefully
planned and exceedingly wise policy.
One thing in particular will make his
most distant city popular and its har
bor always well filled. No customs
charges are asked, for it is a free port,
and no more dock and harbor fees
are required than are absolutely nec
essary. Of course, his obje^i is very
plain, quite as plain as hliup-to-date
â¢facilities, and if his course of action
does not attract and hold trade the
Russian will be bitterly disappointed.
Not only in this respect has the city
been improved in double quick order
and with great foresight. The streets
are wide and well paved, with good
sewers; there are public parks, fine
public buildings, hospitals, electric
light plants and all else that goes to
make a city comfortable and attrac
tive.
ishlngly fast rate, until it covered, -writh
the Manchurian lines, more than twice
the distance between San Francisco
and New York. In Dalny, his pet city,
he saw that great docks were built, so
that they might be in readiness to
handle freight and passengers when,
they knocked for entrance, for be
cleverly figured out that the port was
too convenient to be Ignored.
Ever)* country recognized his mas
ter stroke and Mr. Norman, ah Eng
lish writer, says: . "Since the great
wall of China the world has seen no
material undertaking of equal magni
tude. That Russia should have con
ceived It and carried it out makes
imagination falter for her future in
fluence upon the course of human
events." And indeed, though 'Dalny
and the cities near it seem so far
away, too far, in fact, to bother the
other-nations much at first, they are
now looming* up and Informing: the
world In general that Western Rus
sia is not to be sneezed at. Of a
truth, when all one has to do is to
pick up a newspaper In New Tork
or some of the other large cities in the
world to see notices and dates of pro
posed sales and leases, it brings to
light In a hurry that new Russia is
pursuing a very wise and liberal pol
icy and furthermore that she proposes
to make thi's latest possession of hers
felt an a world power.
The eiciled convicts that had been
Siven their liberty were stationed up
and down the river to aid and abet him
when he needed them most, and so
once again Russia gained a foothold
upon Chinese territory. In fact, Mura
vieff was after honors and he didn't
rest until his country gained by clever
negotiations the harbor of Vladivo
stok', which is to-day Russia's north
ern fortress on the Pacific coast and
of supreme importance. The situation
In itself renders it practically secure,
for It is surrounded by mountains and
can be reached from the front only
by a long channel, so it presents a
most uninviting and inhospitable ap
pearance. Of harbors, there is no
doubt but that it is more thoroughly
protected than any other naval station
In the world. The process of fortifying
It and making It absolutely safe from
the Intruders alone caused Russia to
send over peasants in great numbers,
and later, when the port was opened
for commerce, they poured into the
territory by the tens of thousands and
gladly made permanent settlements,
And then, by way of variety* the
Crimean war burst forth and set things
jingling lit a merry rate. Russia need
ed more ground in order to protect her
self from the French and English, ai
without saying "by your leave" she
helped herself to it, and very gener
ously *at that. In fact, what she really
succeeded in doing was to change the
geography of that entire region. The
Governor of Siberia, one Muravieff by
name, sent his soldiers in 1854 down the
Amur River a second time, but this was
not ull by any manner of means that he
did.
Immediately the troubled pot began
to boil furiously, for both Russia and
China promptly claimed Jurisdiction,
and Chinese soldiers were dispatched
with all possible speed to tell the In
truders that about the wisest thing
they cou'd do would be to go home and
mind their on ti business. Rfgrht there
and then be&an the struggle for Man
churia. For a period of nearly fifty
years the two powers struggled with
all their might and main for supreme
acy and in 16SS a treaty was finally
made that gave all tne land north of
the Amur River, extending up to the
middle of the sea. of Okhotsk, to the
Chinese Empire. So, for once in her
life, Russia was obliged to haul down
the flag that she had planted so proud
ly and with so much arrogance.
The people of Russia are patient and
hard-working, and their home is deso
late and gives them sustenance very
grudgingly, but notwithstanding this
and the fact that the country as a
whole was gradually expanding and
stretching its greedy arms as far in
every direction as it possibly could, the
treaty of Xertchinsk was faithfully
kept for nearly rOO years, and not the
faintest trace of Russian influence was
Celt in this much sought after basin.
Up to the time the Russian explorers
began to prow 1 about on the Amur
River the surrounding country was
practically never heard of, but because
they had ventured into a strange, un
known land that pretended to be noth
ing more or less than a u-ilderness in

k / â \ a NCE upon a time there was a prize
J^Jp^H^i^ package of the masculine persuasion
i sÂ§P#^*^iÂ»\ w * 10 came when . you called him
''llv-* i\^Mf Charles. The greater part of Charles'
r'C-^J â¢ -Sjyffi j time was spent in opening letters with
[es^^saes^BS a white rose scent hanging about them
and in arranging the photographs on his bureau. All
that he had to do to put the- other men out of the run
ning was to walk into'the room and hang out his best
quality of expansive smile and the trick was done. In
every particular he was the only and original glass of
fashion and mold of form and his regular sartorial lay
out was calculated to make a tailor's model pull down
the blinds and take refuge behind the bankruptcy act.
It was a matter of common knowledge that Charles
could have had any girl in town f?r the asking and in
the majority of cases he wouldn't have had to do more
than emit a gentle hint. As it was he had to carry
a long pole around with him to keep the applicants at
a distance. The preacher who could get Charles to air
his voice in the choir loft every Sunday morning had
his fortune made forthwith. All the young ladies in
town immediately decided that the brand of spiritual
food served up at that place .was just the thing that
they had been hungering and thirsting for, and flocked
to the place in a body, if not in the spirit. If Charles
could have hired himself out as a sandwich man to the
manufacturer of a health food there is no doubt that
that manufacturer could have retired from business and
built a house in the country inside of a year.
But Charles, like many other charmers, was a heart
less trifler. Many a time and oft, if not a little oftener,
he had brought down some gay butterfly of fashion to
his feet and then gone off to leave the poor creature to
writhe in helpless agony. The Society for the Preven
tion of Cruelty to Debutantes had often considered .him,
but they didn't seem to be able to get enough .evidence
together to make out a case against him. The fact of
the matter was that Charles could no more help being
charming than a trust can help being watered; it was
the nature of the creature. If he had painted his face,
or bought a large block of stock in the Thistledown
Trust, or announced that he had voted the Democratic
' ticket all his life, or done something else . equally in
vidious to remove the soft bloom from* his youthful
r cheek, he might have been able to avoid the evil conse
quences that seemed inevitably to attend his progress
through this world of care and hard luck, but as long
as he remained as Providence and his tailor made him
he seemed destined to wade through a sea of broken
hearts to the richest heiress in sight,
j As is natural in such cases there were many false
alarms. At one time it was announced by his diligent
press agent that he had been caught in the net of an
heiress from Texas who had more money than some
people have ways of spending it, but it turned out that
Charles had detected the young lady in the act of eating
pie with a knife and that settled her case. Another
aspiring huntress with a large block of mining stock, iri
a real mine, had him almost at the tape ready -for the
starter when she incautiously said "have went." That
was about all for her. She confessed judgment and the
court issued an execution without a dissenting voice.
These few mishaps would have been likely to give
pause to the other representatives of the sex who were,
still in the field, were it not that, hope springs rather
more eternally in the feminine breast than "anywhere
else. As fast as one fell out of the ranks, sorely wpund
ed, another stepped forward to take the stricken one's
place and the onward . march on the cardiac bastions of
the redoubtable Charles continued. A -girl; from the
sunny south where the accent dieth not and the historical
novel is not quenched led a : forlorn hope only to die in
_the trenches when Charles discovered that she was not
entirely pleased with his taste in neckties and wouid
probably insist on buying them for_ him after the fatal
knot should have been tied. â¢
What Charles wanted, he often declared, was a wife
whose soul should be attuned to his in perfect accord.

and many a man has to be content with one that can
strike the proper chord once in a while, in addition to
darning* socks and making buckwheat cakes. But
Charles was no cheap Imitation Russia leather article
himself and nothing less. than a"soul that was approved
by the best judges in the market would suit him.
One girl who came so near to filling the bill that she
could almost hear the wedding bells in the dim distance
was thrown into the discard because she wasn't on
familiar speaking terms with the broad "a." This in
Charles's eyes was proof positive of a vulgar origin, and
if there was anything that Charles' sensitive soul shied
at it was; vulgarity. Another young lady had her mouth
wide open ready to yell "yes" when it was disclosed

light should be sent straight from the place -where
such angels come from for the express purpose of fore
closing a first lien on his affections. When things were
at their blackest Charles decided that he was in need
of a typewriter. The young lady who answered his
advertisement was about as attractive as an icecream
soda iri January, but she knew her business and there
wasn't any grass growing on the keys when she was
around. Also she knew a whole lot about men and was
aware that the best way to get around the alleged
stronger sex was to let it have its own way, on paper,
and to sec that the question never came to a vote.
Therefore, when Charles brought his soul out of its
cage and exhibited it to her one day, she put on a look
of admiring amazement and solemnly assured him that
in all her travels she had never seen a soul that could
touch his for all around performances. Following up ,
this lead she permitted him to think that his taste in
matters of dress was about the best that had ever come
down the pike and that what he didn't know about
everything in general wasn't worth any one else's while
to try to learn. In this way she very soon convinced
Charles that she was a woman of rare discernment and
that what she lacked in beauty of her own she made up
in ability to appreciate his. The other girls had made
the mistake of supposing that the way to impress a man
is to show their own charms; the typewriter knew that
the proper plan of procedure is to be impressed with the
man as often as he seems to expect it.
As a result it wasn't two months before the wedding,
bells were ringing and Charles was safely landed. The
typewriter used English that would have disgraced an
applicant for admission to college and her style of
dress would have made her unpopular in an old ladies'
home, but she landed Charles good and hard with all
his goods ,and chattels and other material comforts
thereunto appertaining. One might think that Charles
found out his mistake iri due course, but as a matter of
fact he' boasts so much about his wife's superior quali
ties that the men go around the other way of the block
w hen they see him coming. It is likely that her soul
has never been turned at all, but to Charles' ear it is the
only one in the orchestra that is anything like the real
thing.
People, who dote on morals and such things can prob
ably discover from this scattered heap of English that
the reason that so many men go through the woods and
pick out a crooked stick at the other side is thac a
crooked stick is just the kind they need.

WHY IS A
WEDDING?What shall be said conc.rning the
bad habits which have already become
fixed in children? If. habits have been
growing stronger and stronger for
years It Is folly to expect that they can
be completely changed In a short time-
This is no easy undertaking. Habits
can be broken only in the same way
that they have been acquired; and that
'is by practice. Those whj? have strong
will power we may help to succeed in
escaping fromrthe bondage of habits
quickly. With others we must be pre
pared to labor hard and lone
By strong resolution; by careful
watching. lest the old 4 habit assert It
self; by determined fighting against
the tendency to do that which is
wrong; by avoiding thoughts, persons
and places which ace tie cause of the
temptation; by keeping busy all the
time; and, when possible, performing
acts the opposite of the habit to be
broken; by never becoming dlscour

It was as near savagery as Sonnich

than at any other time, except during
those days when he rode the Pacific
in the Don Adolfo and saw wonderful
happenings that he promised himself to
weave one day into a book. It was on
his first sea trip, while he was 16, that
he saw the. Incident of Pedersen's re

little yarn called "The Saga of Trig

Pedersen was the' bucko mate of a

they trapped and killed and sold their

story of it was told him next day by
the murderer.
It -was a horrible thing.* The sailor
was a sworn enemy of the mate, for
no good or obvious reason, and the ex

was that "he wanted to see how a

squealing that he looked like a chicken

At the end of these adventures So'n
nichsen decided that he was ready to
settle down, and he returned to San
Francisco to take up newspaper work.
"I was on the staff of The Call for
three whole days," he says. "I don't
know what my duties wereâ I didn't
have time to find out. On the third
day a man said to me, "Want to go to

said, 'Yes,' and I went to the manager

we found everything right tide up with

He tells these tales and many more
in the same matter-of-course way that
you might tell of a stroll or a day's
shopping. He lay at death's door in a
miserably, equipped hospital. He hid In
bushes and swam dangerous streams to
avoid detection by natives. ".. :-> 'â¢'
Besides all these experiences in the
Pacific and the Philippines, he has
sailed the seas of the world. He was
the only American that ever sailed In
an argosy. It was an old steamer
bought by merchants in Russia, and a
crew was shipped in â¢ England. Son
nichsen sailed in the midst of a Babel,
for no two men aboard were* of the
same nationality, j. _
"And I've pulled through it all. yon
see," he said. , "I suppose I'll always
pull through. And I have turned up in
civilization again."
"Will you al-rp â turn up in civiliza

He listened a moment to the consol
idated roar of the "L" trains and the
surface cars and the wagons and the
automobiles and . the subway blastings
and again he made the motion of push
ing it all away. But he did not answer.
Sonnichsen still refuses to look upon
New York as home, even though hi3
work has made it necessary for him to
live here part of the time. But he con
siders himself a prisoner In a New York
"compartment," where he boards, and
frets for the outdoor life that he has
never really given up. Just now he
has a little studio in an apartment
house ; near the . park, and he*, may be
found in all kinds of weather tramping

Malolos with more than twenty
wretched criminals.
"I know how it feels to be con
demned to death. This young Amer
ican and I had our death sentence
passed. "We were then thrown tato
separate cells and allowed to wait four
days, each of us alone, to think the
matter over. It's an odd thing that all
the horror of It came to me at first
and steadily dulled, so that the last
night I slept excellently and woke in
good spirits, ready to die a dramatic
death. I became very much inter
ested In wondering how I would be
have when led out to be shot. I
seemed to get outside myself, as if I
were thinking of another man.
"We waited through the fourth day
and nothing happened. We never knew
the real inside of the matter, but for
some reason the "insurgents thought
better of their plan.
"Lieutenant Glllmore gave me a ciph
er message which I carried In the hol
low of my bamboo stick for many miles,
being discovered on the way by bolo
men and chased by them through the
jungles. I was from the 13th to the
26th of November In reaching the offi
cers of the Oregon with the message,
but the terrible journey was over at
last."
Jose and I liked the simple life there,
but I missed the water and the sailors.
The best I could do was to read every
sea story I could find in the library. I
didn't approve of them."
"These stories are not true to life," I
said, picking to pieces Marryat and
Cooper and the rest of the lot.
"Then it came into my head to write
some of my own. As soon as I had
thought of it I knew that I'd never rest
until it was accomplished. To this end
I determined to go to sea myself.
"But you mustn't think that all was
plain sailing at home, for it wasn't by
any manner of means. My father
heartily disapproved of my even think
ing of writing and even to this day
laughs with scorn when publishers
couple my name with such men as
Conan Doyle. He not only thinks but
says it is utter nonsense.
"And my trip to sea and my captiv
ity was a great sorrow and worry to
both of my parents, but somehow I
couldn't help it. The sea called and I
went to her."
It was a primitive way to prepare to
write, was it not â to try to know
what one is writing about. In this age
ot smatterings and superficialities,
when books are turned out by the
cord and the author of a Roman novel
writes It in his study in Boston or New
York. It was a primitively direct thing
to do â to learn the sea for the sake
of being its true interpreter. .
When .the idea entered his head he
was. too young as yet to make a voy
age. So he contented himself for the
time with getting out magazines,
which he printed entirely on his own
little hand press. These contained
thrilling sea tales that he had heard
or invented.
"Hardly had he uttered the last
Â¦word when the pirate captain drew a
small, sharp dagger and was about to
plunge it into the boatswain's heart,
when Campbell kicked it out of his
hand. While stooping, to pick it up
the pirate sprang upon his back.
"Twisting his arm around he stab
bed'the rascal in the breast, who with
a groan relaxed his hold and fell to
the floor."
This is a specimen of one of the
palpitating tales that appeared in se
rial form in Excelsior, which you may
not know was being published In San
Francisco in 1891, when its editor
was 12.
He went to school in Oakland. Some
Oakland boys were going camping and
wanted Sonnichsen to join them, but
he did not like their "way of living the
out of doors life. ;^, V,.:
"They had tents and complete cook
ing" outfits." this young savage told
me, scornfully.
"I should say so. I knew every ship

was big enough to walk alone," he told
me. "I lived among those old vessels
and their crews. The men all knew me.

fishingâ deep sea fishing Is the only
kind that interests hirrir He has a
splendid scorn for the sort of man that
does not care for an outdoor life.
"The men of brains have, almost
without exception, been the men of
muscle," is one of his theories. "Mental
vigor goes hand in hand with physical."
His favorite pastime is tramping. He
would rather â¢walk thirty miles in a
day than do anything else. Hs has
been known to miss a meal for the sake
of a good walk.
As for what he thinks about girls,
he says there is no girl In the world
like the "Western one, and he ha* cer
tainly seen enough of the world to be
a judge. "I admire all kinds of accom

caught up by society and he has been
called upon to serve as lion ever since.
Mrs. Schuyler Van Rensselaer enter
tained him, and he was feted at Boston
clubs. But all this means nothing to
him compared with the happiness of a
day up at the cabin.
His memories of San Francisco be
long largely to the old consulate out at
Seventeenth and Howard streets, where
he was born. Nicholas Sonntchsen, his
father, was Consul for Sweden, Norway
and Denmark, and the boy was born
under the flags of those countries. Hs
is literally a man without a country.
for the fact that those flags flew over
h!s head prevented him from bein? an
American citizen and the fact that
there were three of them prevented his
being accredited to any one of those
nations. So. although he calls himself
an American, he would have a hard
time to prove Itâ and the world is a
small enough country for him to claim
after all his rovtags which have nar
rowed it so wonderfully.
But his real home nowadays Is the
little cabin up at Pearl River. It Is in
beautiful Rockland County, New Tork.
and here he spends all the time that he
can get away from the office. He often
takes his stories up there' to writ*.
The cabin belongs to Albert Ballln.
the famous deaf mute painter. Sonnich

times occupied it together. Sometimes
Sonnichsen has taken It alone and
"bached it."

HOW LITERARY NEW YORK HAS CAPTURED
A CALIFORNIA BOY*yi S before indicated, training
f I means the formation of habits. Â¦
I I Other animals learn by Instinct;
J[ man only by practice. He is
therefore said to be but a bundle
of habits. A person's character is de
termined by the character of the habits
of which the bundle is composed. It is .
represented by the sum of our good and
bad habits. If we were not creatures
of habit we could make but little If
any progress, as all our time and at
tention would have to be given to the
simplest functions of body and mind.
Good habits are the result of the
repetition of right actions; bad habits
the result of wrong actions. The 'child i
who gets into the habit of doing what
is right because it Is right, , will not â¢
only be a good child, but will almost
certainly develop into a noble man" or',
woman. The opposite^ is also true. * Â¦
Habits not only determine the mental r
and physical action, but also the moral '
as well. More than this, to a large
extent they warp the conscience, that
divine guide which is. the highest au
thority given to man.
Very few fully appreciate the Im
portance of .correct habits. No one
who does not appreciate â¢ the power â¢ of
habit Is fitted to train a child. It Is
not merely second nature, It - is far
stronger than nature itself. Dr. Mauds
ley, in his psychology of mind,' em
phasizes the effect and : importance ' of
habit as follows: "If any act became
no easier after being done . several
times, if the careful direction ' of con- v
sciousness were necessary 'tO; : its ac-*
complishment on each occasion, it . is
evident that the whole activity of a
lifetime might be confined to one or
two deeds â that no progress could take
place In development ; A man might be
occupied, all : day. In \ dressing and - un
dressing himself; the attitude ' of his .
body would absorb all his attention and
energy; the washing of ' his hands i or
the fastening of a button would be as
difficult to him on each occasion as to
the child on its .first trial; , and he
would, furthermorv be completely ex
hausted by his exertions. Think of the
pains , necessary ' to ; ; teach a . child- to
stand, of the many efforts which -it
must, make, and of the ease with which
it* at last ' stands, unconscious * of any
effort',' .
Even though we may -begin to appre
ciate the } importance of habit j In j the
life- of., the- individual,, few -have any
conception of the, influence which the
habits" of individuals have upon the
prosperity and] even the very life of
government ; Seldom, if ; ever, - has this
been\betterV stated than by/ James, in
his . latest: psychology, j Speaking upon
this, point, he says: "Habit is thus the
enormous s flywheel of society, fits ; most
precious \ conservative agent \ It * alone
is what keeps us all within the bounds
of ordinance, and saves the children of
fortune from the envious uprisings of
the poor. It alone prevents the hardest
and most repulsive walks of life from
being deserted by those brought up to
tread therein. ; It keeps the fisherman
and the deckhand at sea . through the
winter; lÂ£ holds the miner in his dark
ness, and . nails the J countryman â¢ to | his
log cabin and his lonely farm through
all the months of snow; it protects us
from invasion: by the natives of the
desert and the frozen zone. It dooms us
all to fight ; out - the Â¦ battle of Â¦ life upon
the , lines /of ] our nature or . our . early
choice, and .to make the best of. a pur
suit that disagrees, because there is no
other for which ' we' are fitted, and it is
too late to" begin again." Â¦
The'same writer has said, "The hell
to ' be I endured hereafter, of . which the
ology ,tells, is no worse than the hell we
make' for ourselves ;in'Â£ this > world by
habitually fashioning our characters in
the wrong way. Could the young ' but
realize how soon* they will become mere
walking bundles of habits they would
give more heed to their conduct while in
the plastic state. We are spinning our
own fates, good or evil, and never to be
undone. Every smallest stroke of vir
tue or vfee leaves its never so little
scar. The drunken Rip Van Winkle, in
Jefferson's , play, excuses himself for
every fresh dereliction by saying, 'I
won't count this time.' Well, he may
not count it. and a kind heaven may
not count it, but it Is to be counted none
the less. Down among the nerve cells
and fibers the molecules are counting
it, registering and storing it up to be
used against him when the next temp
tation comes. Nothing we ever do is,
in strict scientific llteralness, wiped out.
Of course this has its good side as well
as its bad one. As we become perma
nent drunkards . by â¢ so , many separate
drinks, so we become saints In the
moral and authorities and experts in
the practical and scientific spheres by
bo many separate-acts and hours of
work." -
music but that"
The Gregorian chant dates from the
year 590, when it was arranged ,Jor
church service by Gregory I, one of the
most famous and brilliant of the Popes,
who has been surnamed the great.
There were sixteen Popes who were
known as Gregory,' and of them two,
the author of the chant and Hilde
brand, who brought Henry of Germany
barefooted and penitent to Canossa to
hold his stlrniD as he mounted his
horse, have been designated as great.
Even as long ago as the close of the
sixth century there was a tendency to
introduce theatrical music at church
services and to give undue prominence
to the musical part of the ceremony, so
Gregory, taking the Ambrosian chant,
then in general use in the western
church, founded on. it his style, banish
ing, from the church all rhymetlcal
singing. He founded a school for the
teaching of his chant, and for several
centuries the Schola Cantoriurn was a
famous musical Institution. \
But the tendency to drift into elab
orate music showed j itself so strbngly
In the fourteenth century, that Pope
John XXII issued a â¢ bull restraining
musicians and singers from the lengths
to which they had gone and recalling
them again to the* use of the earlier
Gregorian chant. Two hundred years
later, â¢ on the recommendation )jf <~the
council of Trent, In 1576, Gregory XIII
again insisted on a reform in church
music and the use of the chant; and
once more the successor of John and
the Gregories indorses and repeats their
admonitions and directions.
The Gregorian^ chant Is. of a slow, and
solemn measure, and any one. who has
visited* a Catholic church for .vespers
or the evening service has probably
heard it, and also at some parts of the
mass.
Pope Pius X directs that only Latin
shall be sung at solemn liturgical func
tions, and forbids any undue repeti-
tlon of ' the words of the â¢ text, . any
breaking of syllables or inversion of
words," or separating: any- part of the
mass Into separate pieces in such a
way as. that: each of such pieces may
form a j complete composition in itself
and be capable of -being detached from
the re"st and substituted by another. In
other words, "the Pope does not approve
of the same airs and style: of music be
ing used for a - ballet dance \ Saturday
evening at the opera and for a solemn
religious ceremony the following morn
ing in ' the church. People! therefore,
who go . to . both the opera and the
church will not be led to imagine the
scenes i they have seen at the former
while sitting in the latter, as not infre
quently, happens at present-
As ' It frequently happens that the
choir is so "elaborate with its muslo
that the religious ceremony proper Is
entirely lost sight of, the Pope directs
that the . singing; shall be cut â¢ down so
as not .to keep the clergyman waiting
until it has got through with its
flourishes. He also forbids all bands In
churches and banishes pianos absolute
ly from --religious, worship. Orchestras
when allowed- â¢ on special occasions
must play only solemn music suitable
to accompany the organ. The result
of these regulations will be to consid
erably cut short the length of the serv
ice while greatly Increasing its solem
nity.
The Pope says that as the singers,
even when they are laymen, are really
taking the place of the "ecclesiastical
choir formerly employed * in all
churches, therefore women, as being
incapable of exercising such office, can
not be admitted to form part of the
choir or of the. musical chapel. When
ever,'then, It Is desired to employ tho
acute voices of sopranos and contral
tos these parts must be taken by boys,
according, to the most ancient usage of
the church. .. .-
Finally he directs that "only those
are to be admitted to form part
of the musical chapel of a church who
are men of known piety and probity
of life, and these should by their mod
est and devout bearing during the litur
gical functions show that they are
worthy of the holy office they exer
cise. It will also be fitting that sing
ers while singing in church wear the
ecclesiastical habit and surplice, and
that they be hidden behind gratings
when the choir Is excessively open to
public ga2e."
To carry out the return to tba Gre
gorian chant of early days special com
missioners are to be appointed by the
bishops to see ( that the churches con
form to the Pope's directions; and ec
clesiastical students preparing for the
prlesthopd are to be especially trained
In the chant and the solemn style of
church music.
Of course it will take some time be
fore all these regulations j and direc
tions of the Pope can be carried out.
though fn many parts of thÂ» East
male choirs havo Ions been thÂ» rnla.
In this city male choirs slngr the ves
pers at the Cathedral. St. Ignatius and
other Catholic churches, though, often
parts of the services are sung In very
elaborate style, which will now hava to
be discontinued. Tha choirs are to be
come a far less important part of thÂ«
service than they have been, which, la
exactly what the Pope purposes. Of
course. In the smaller towns and Til
lages It will probably bo found imprac
ticable to have all male choirs, and
women will be retained, although thÂ»
style of music will have to conform
to the Gregorian; as a result of this
reform by the Pope people who et> to
Catholic churches to hear the muslo
will in future probably stay at home.
The Pope himself is so determined to*
have his views carried out that In Roma
he has supplemented his bull by a spe
cial letter to his Cardinal Vicar direct
ing him to carry out the changes re
commended at once In order that Romi
may set an example In the reform to
the rest of the world.
It was said that Archbishop Farley
of New York had gone to Rome to
protest on the part and In the name of
the American Bishops against the rule
excluding women from choirs. The
rumor, however, is positively denied
and It is said the Archbishop of New
York has no such purpose in visiting
the Pope, but on the contrary he
strongly favors the bull and for years
male cholra and Gregorian chants have
been the rule so far as possible in his
diocese as they are In Baltimore under
Cardinal Gibbons.
Under any circumstances the local
Archbishop or Bishop Is charged with
putting the Pope's directions into force
and of course can use his discretion
as to 'time and methods of carrying
them out, though undoubtedly there
will be as little delay in the matter as
possible. Archbishop Klordan, conse
quently, will decide on the course he
will take for this archdiocese. Bishop
Conaty for Los Angeles and Bishop
Grace for and the north
and they may all have different ideas
and pursue different methods in com
plying with the Pope's wishes.
PROTESTANTS as well as Cath
olics will be interested in the
recent bull of the Pope direct
ing a radical reform in church
music. Only the other day the Presby
terians at their conference of the
alumni of the San Francisco Theo
logical Seminary at Saint Anselmo dis
cussed this very subject and agreed
unanimously that church music
should be "stately and dignified," and
that theatrical airs and sentimental
tunes have no place in a religious ser
vice. The Episcopalians have the
same view and have encouraged the
idea by establishing male choirs in
which boys take the part usually suns
by women. And now comes the Pope
and in a lengthy letter on the subject
declares that the great religious or
ganization of which he is head must
return to the solemn and impressive
Gregorian chant of ita earlier days.
and must banish fancy singing and
female voices from ita choirs.
In his bull, entitled (from the first
two words) "Mortu Proprio," the Pope
points out that a great departure has
taken place from the Intention of the
church in authorizing the use of mu
sic at services, which was to supple
ment, not supplant, the religious cere
monies, and to add additional solem
nity to the occasion. His Holiness re
marks that when the music is very
elaborate and theatrical It distracts
the attention of the worshipers, leads
their thoughts away from the religious
ceremonies belns peitformed at the
altar, delays the priest in the "per
formance of his functions and has.
therefore. Just the opposite tendency
from what Is intended by the church
in permitting its use. âThe qualities
that church music should possess, he
say*. Â£re possessed In the highest de
gree by the Gregorian chant- and,
therefore, he directs that the chant
"be largely restored to the function of
public worship and â¢ everybody must
take for certain that an ecclesiastical
function loses nothing of its solemnity
when it is accompanied by no other

certain British towns who annually of

The WorkinsriKin's Part. ..
Such matters are of the utmost im
portance of the working'classes of Great
Britain. They afreet their daily lives
and their personal health, which in the
case of many is their only capital.- "â¢
Working men and' women should
therefore bestir themselves to see that
these vital questions are carefully con
sidered in their interests by (municipal
and educational authorities. Let it be
once known that the working classes
,are alive to the necessity of their chil
dren being trained in school in such a
The rapidity with which this change
is taking place is hardly realized by
most people. Health is not so jeopar
dized In the country as it is in towns,
and hence men and women who have
to live in cities should study more care
fully how to preserve their health. In
1801 the whole population of England,
Wales and Scotland was only 10,942,000,
whereas now it is 36,998,181. and this '
addition is almost : entirely urban.
Twenty-five years ago only" about half
the population lived In urban districts,
now the proportion is three-quarters,
that is to say, that now three persons
live in an urban to Ene who lives In a
rural district. It is 'a well-known ax-
Jom of hygienic science that the health
of a population, other things being
equal, is in inverse ratio to its density.
In plain English, other things being
equal, a population crowded together
is more unhealthy than one that is
scattered. The British people are be
coming daily more crowded, together,
and hence, unless some steps are taken,
and that soon, to counteract the effects
of undue concentration, the national
health must inevitably saffer.
Some Remedies.
What are the steps which can be
taken? The;' are many and various,
but we may mention a few.
1. Every effort should be made to
counteract all unnecessary increase of
towns, and, when possible, new facto
ries or industries should be established
in and old ones transferred - to the
country.
2. Care should be taken that all
towns should be furnished with a suf- 1
flcient number of. parks.'and especially
with a large number of small play
grounds, fitted with gymnastic appa
ratus and under the charge of care
takers, and so placed that no work
man's house should if possible be more
than a quarter of a mile from such
a ground. .- i
X 3. Children should be taught the
rudiments of hygiene, sanitation and
physiology, ho as to have some slight
knowledge of the causes of disease,
and the means which can be taken to
avoid it.
4. They should, by cookery classes
in schools, be shown how to obtain the
largest amount of nourishment with
the smallest expenditure on food; what
kind. of foods are wholesome; and how
food should be cooked so as to make
it not only palatable but easily digest
ed and consequently nourishing.
5. They should be taught self
restraint in order to learn when they
grow ud how to rule themselves, and
how to place a bridle on their appe*_
tites and passions, and on those indul-
But, Indeed, statistics are not neces
sary. We only require to go into thÂ»
more crowded parts of our large towns
and to use our eyes in order to perceive
how weak, stunted and ill- formed are
many of the young men ajÂ»d young
women who are to be founfl in their
midst.
"It Is somewhat depressing.** said thÂ«
Dally Graphic In a recent issue, "to
learn from good authority that, al
though the British recruit .before thÂ«
late war about equaled the German In
height, his weight, the surer criterion
of physical strength and stamina,- was
considerably less."
The above statement may, indeed. be
characterized a<5 "depressing." 'but 11
It be true it is^weil that 'we should
know it, In order that we may live In
no fool's paradise, but may be able
without loss of time to take effective
-steps to bring about a condition of af
fairs less hurtful to our pride, and
more In keeping with the popular, but
at present fallacious, notion of the
physical superiority of the Briton.
The Royal Commission for Scotland
on Physical Training has borne impor
tant witness to the unsatisfactory
physical state of the Scotch people, and
has suggested remedies which it Is
hoped that the Government and theÂ»
local authorities will not b3 slow In
adopting, but if the condition of tba
people of Scotland be so bad we may
be sure that that of the people of Eng
land and "Wales, of whom over 12.000,
000 are crowded into forty-four cities
with an average population of over
270,000 each, must be still worse.
A Koj-al Commission Required.
As it is of the greatest importance
that nothing should be left to conjec
ture in so Important a matter, the Gov
ernment would be well advised to fol-
Icw the precedent they have set them
selves in the case of Scotland and ap
point a royal commission to inquire
into the physical condition of the peo
ple of England and Wales.
The terms of reference to the Scotch
commission might well be adopted,
mutatis mutendis, as those under which
the English commission might be in
structed to act, namely:
To inquire Into the opportunities for
physical training now available in the
state aided schools and other educa
tional institutions of Scotland and to
suggest means by which such training
may be made to conduce to the wel
fare of the pupils and further how such
opportunities may be increased by con
tinuation classes and otherwise, so as
to develop, in their practical application
to the requirements of life, the faculties
of those who have left the day schools
and thus to contribute toward the
sources of national strength.
In the meantime the people of Great
Britain, and especially the working
classes living in our large cities, who
compose that portion of our population
which Is most directly Interested in
the subject, should bestir themselves
and use all the legitimate Influence
they possess to Impress members o*
Parliament, Corporations. Town and
County Councilors, educational au
thorities and other of the urgent ne
cessity which exists to turn their most
serious attention to matters appertain
ing: to ths health, strength and physical
condition of the people of this conn

physique of thÂ» British raca.

and yet, how small a part of all this
thought, trouble and expenditure is di
rected toward imparting to children
knowledge which in after years shall
.enable them to understand the laws of
nature and to maintain their own and
their future children's bodies in health
and strength.
More Knowledge â Licss ' Learning.
â¢What is the good of book learning if
-we are ignorant of the nature of our
own bodies and of those laws which
were intended to make life happy, but
if neglected made it i burden and a
misery?
Whut avails material prosperity, if
either lÂ»y our own fault, or that of our
parents, we are unable, through ill
health, either to enjoy life or to be of
use to our country or our friends?
Let us consider what are the sub
jects, a knowledge of which lead if
properly applied, to an increase 'in
physical health.
Surely such as hygiene, sanitation,
rhysiology, dietetics, cookery and
housewifery. Of course it would bft
foolish to attempt to teach children
more than the mere elements* of some
of these subjects, but the general prin
ciples which underlie the preservation
of .health might well occupy the atten
tion of teachers and scholars for a rea
sonable number of hours in each year.
If we look through the branches of
knowledge studied by our children at
school, how seldom do we come across
any subjects which may be of use to
them in' after years in assisting them
to preserve their bodies in health, and
when these subjects are taught how
thinly attended are the classes? Why
is this?
It is due in a large measure to lack
of teachers qualified to instruct in
these matters, to incapacity at head-
Quarters to understand the real needs
of the people, and In no small degTee
on the ps.rt of the parents to a misap
prehension of the present conditions of
life.
Parents are apt to argue that be
cause they never learned these sub
jects, which in plain English only
mean the study of how best to keep
the body in health, it is unnecessary
for their children to do so. They for
get, however, that the most rapid
transformation In the character of the
British people is taking place before
thetr eyes, that the England of their
youth is not the England we know,
and that the England of ten. twenty
and of thirty years hence will be en
tirely different from the England of to
day. The fact is that the British,
from bavins b?en mainly an agricul
tural, are rapidly becoming an urban
people. In other words, whereas for
merly they lived fn the country, now
they live in the towns.

Music to the Hawaiian is the open
tesaire to his sensibilities. If he suf
fers, he moans in musical measures.
If he is sad, he sighs in some minor
cadence. Even his anger leaps to a
parr.ut cf varied utterances like the per
exaptory staccato of a beaten "ukulili."
and his expressions of love or hat*.
cf hope o-r despair, are best interpreted
through his natural medium of rhyth
mical sounds. The original music of
the native is largely traditional. It is
not a science; it is a melody flowing
from the soul, linking itself with kin
dred expressions cf feeling or passion
into chords or harmonies as complete
as ever fell from the pen cf Bach or
Beethoven, while unconscious of cum
bers cr caJ dilation. In their curricu
lum discord is impossible. Theirs is as
veritably the music of nature as the
aggregation of bird song, or the un
spoken throb cf deep night, or the dis
tant hum cf city life Is the keynote to
the universe of sound. Is there any
thing more pitiable than the "aloha"
of poor Liiiuokalani. composing the
ante-raortem of her dead realm, sing-
withdrawn, and the atmosphere about
him would make a cold storage ware
house seem like a hothouse. This la
because the material resources of Ha
waii are Inelastic and cannot be devel
oped or extended, except, on limited
lines. Like the table d'hote dinner of a
French pension, there is enough for
twelve regular guests, but only enough,
and an unexpected addition of a guest
compels each of the others to do with
out a portion cf h!s dinner. The annual:

of larger areas on the mainland to ths

And with all these factors accounted
for. there remains the ever present and
slowly growing labor famine. We may
reason and moralize, and beg, and
threaten and deny and asseverate, but
at last the undeniable fact remains
that white men cannot or at least will
not labor in the cane fields. Every

some Chinese, and against their re

The social life outside of the regular

There "was. before it was oroken up by
private effort, a great bagnio, which
â¢was practically licensed and under open
police -protection. Among, Its six hun
died Inmates there were Japanese, Chi
nese, Portuguese and French women,
but not a single Hawaiian. And yet
the Hawaiian women do not pretend tu
be strict observers of the moral law.
There are hundreds of households In
which the birth of ths elder children
were entered upon the family record
before the marriage ceremony was per
formed. But ; neither their own visiting
list nor that of their parents was there
by restricted, and in the olden days it
was considered by a husband a dis
tinguished honor to have a chief for
the father of one of his wife's children.
The Hawaiian idea of civic duty was
expressed by an indignant native when
the superintendent of public works
was removed from office by the Gover
nor for having "swiped" public funds
under his control. The defaulter, after
being discovered, replaced the stolen,
money, but his Inexorable excellency"
removed him nevertheless. Thereupon
the native remonstrated against ex- '
ecutlve tyrants and voiced Kanaka
public sentiment when he exclaimed:
"What a shame It was to turn Johnny
out of his office. Didn't he put back
the money?"
"This beautiful dress is for Mrs.
Brown, is it?" said the native wife of a
struggling lawyer in Honolulu to her
dressmaker. "Well, there Is nothing
like the luck of some people. My hus
band is Just as good a lawyer as
Colonel Brown, but he cannot afford to
buy such dresses for me. He has been
here for years and only makes a living,
while Colonel Brown, who has been
here but a few months, jumped into a
big practice at once. You say that he
always wins his cases. Well, of course
he wins his cases, but that is easily ac
counted for. He came down here from

*% YOT long ago a successful busi
/ \ I ness man came to a ministerial
I N friend of mine and said in sub
\_. stance, "I am greatly troubled
about my boys. Not that they are bad
fellows, but they seem to be growing
away from me. I don't feel acquainted
with them. What can I do?" The min
ister, who has boys of his own, by the
way, told him not to magnify at the
moment his parental authority, but to
try the method of comradeship, "go to
their ball games, familiarize yourself
with the names of the crack players on
the football team. " Invite your boys'
companions to the house. Find out
what 'the fellows', in generalare read
ing and studying. Ascertain quietly the
character of their amusements and if
they are legitimate enter heartily your
self Into their recreations and excur
sions." The business man promptly
adopted the advice and a few months
later returned to his counselor, with a
radiant face. "You were right," he said.
"I've been around with the boys a good
deal the last v few -weeks and we are
getting to be first-rate chums. I feel
as if I had gotten my boys back again."
We are worrying to-day more or less
over the decline of parental authority.
America is contrasted to her own dis
advantage with England and the Con
tinent in the matter of home adminis
tration. Deference of j children . to : par
ents, exhibitions of prompt and un
questioned obedience are said to be
rarer than they were a generation ago.
This may be true and I would not con
done a waning of respect on the part of
the young toward their seniors. But if
a relationship of comradeship can be
established we can perhaps secure all
the best results of the older and stricter
regime and at the same time bridge the
chasm that used to exist between father
and son or between mother and daugh
ter.
This Is certainly the natural relation
ship. When our children are young
and helpless before the novelty and
wonder of their presence in the home
have faded away we do not begrudge
the time and the pains it requires to
keep pace with their advancing life.
Every added pound of flesh, every new
tooth delights the fond and admiring
parent. For the sake of tossing them
in his arms a man will leave his busi
ness a little earlier at night than he
used to do when a bachelor. But why
should this close touch with the child
cease or relax when it gets . beyond
the need of the parents' constant physi
cal protection or of their direction in
every little* detail of Its life?
There are multitudes of homes in
America -where this Ideal of Intimacy
has been maintained through gram
mar and high school days and long
after the growings boys and girls have
gone, to college and professional school.
I go into such' homes and find the pa
rents ' conversing at the dinner table
about the subjects the children have
that day been studying. I see on the
center, table textbooks and reference
books which tell of common work to
gether.. I ' note a disposition ' to do
things together, to play games In -which
all can " share, to*' have ! evening com
panies made up of young and old alike,
to plan as a family and not as indi
viduals for little outings and excur
sions. Here we find a shining illustra
tion of what sociologists call the soli
darity ,of the family. It . Is not broken
up into small and competing cliques.
Each member of the home seeks and
promotes the welfare of all the others.
It Is a splendid thing for the children
when the parents are disposed to be on
terms of comradeship. It keeps them
out of â¢ bad company, fosters a due
amount of family spirit and draws out
latent possibilities. For no touch upon
the plastic life of a young child can be
quite so tender and potent as that of
a father or mother. A man of thirty
five told me last week that one reason
why he enjoyed shopping with his wife
Is that his ' mother used to take him
when a lad on shopping expeditions,
explained to him about different fab
rics and helped him to acquire a skill
and wisdom in the expenditure of
money that , has been of incalculable
value ever since he set up housekeeping
for himself.
And the parents get a good deal out
of the relationship, too. jit keeps them
young and hopeful and happy to be
sharing the emotions and ambitions
of enthusiastic and purposeful boys and
girls. Wrinkles and gray hairs, doubta
and fears, pessimism and cynicism
come less quickly to the man or woman
in mature life who has even one down
right good friendship with somebody
under twenty-five years of age.,,There

THE PARENT AS A CHUM
Not dismayed by his experience in
this direction, John Henry mentioned
one evening, when he was more or less
on the witness stand, that his new type
writer was a peach with red hair and
a complexion that made a red rose look
like a coat of whitewash. There was
another typewriter in the office, of
Benedict ( & Co. next day and In ac
cordance' with the plans and specifi
cations prepared by the â nominallyâ
Bllent member of the firm, she had a
large crop of freckles and a face that
made the office clock lose fifteen min
utes the first day. Still firm in his ad
herence to the belief that honesty is
the best policy, when Mrs. Benedict
suggested that her mother be requested
to honor the Benedict domicile with a
visit of Indefinite length. John Henry
informed his wife in firm but gentle
tones that the person aforesaid was
peculiarly obnoxious to him and that
If she appeared on the scene he would
This was more or less the experience
cf John Htnry Benedict. When he first
inveigled Mrs. Benedict into the meshes
of the hcly bonds of matrimony, he
rolemnly assured her that his mind
_ho_ld always be as an open book to
her and that all his acts should be as
plain as the nose on his face. As this
was about as plain as a nose could be.
without artificial aid, it should have
satisfied Mrs. Benedict that the game
was to be open and above board. Mr.
Benedict forgot, or did not know, thai
books which are always open are sub-
PEACE hath her victories no' less
than matrimony, but for pur
poses of convenience we will con
f.re our attention to the latter
class of triumphs. It is commonly
stated by people who are possessed of
large quantities of inexperience that
the only guarantee of domestic heppl
ness in this worM and Its consequent
re-wards in the next Is perfect frankness
and entire truth one with another. The
theoretical admiration that many,
otherwise commonplace and unremark
able people, have for the truth Is one
cf the meet beautiful things known to
man. People who would blush the
deepest possible shade of crimson if
they were brought face to face with
the naked truth, no matter how plain
it was, will calmJy and in the presence
of their fellow men avow their fixed
and underlying belief in the beneficence
of the results accruing from a steady
puTBUit of the truth-
There have been men who have de
clared it to be their opinion that men
ought, en all occasions, to tell the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing
much but the truth to the wives of their
bosoms. It is true that this is only
theory in the majority of cases, but we
have known a few men who attempted
to put it into practice; the majority of
them soon abandoned It, however, at
th* instance of their wive*, who threat
ened to Fue for divorce, not because of
the nature of the things revealed, but
or. th t ground that a man who would do
a thing so unnecessarily foolish was
mentally incapacitated for matrimony.
ject to more wear and tear than ordi
nary volumes, and also that nothing
makes a man-so attractive to a woman
as the idea that there are depths in
his nature which she has not sounded;
Bluebeard chambers which she hae not
1>wpe& into. A man who tells all that
there is to know about himself is like
a newspaper that prints all its news
on the outside page, or a horse race
that always comes out according to
the Inside tips.
Mr. Benedict started out by telling
his wife the names of all of the girls
that he had been engaged to before he
met her. This is in direct violation
of the established matrimonial canon
that neither one of the parties to the
contract shall have been in love be
fore. Mrs. Benedict played her part
of the game according to Hoyle and
although she had had numerous fish
half out of the water before she finally
got the landing net under John Henry,
she made him believe that he was the
first one that she had ever playedâ
and she had played him for a sucker
although he never knew that. In con
sequence of John Henry's rash frank
ness â or frank rashnessâ Mrs. Benedict
never failed to remind him of his pre
vious attempts to butt into the matri
monial fold on the occasion of domestic
crises, coupled as a rule with the fer
vent wish that he had been successful.
John Henry never took refuge be
hind any of the pleasant subterfuges
common to the male sex for explaining
his absence from the family fireside un
til the witching hour of half-past
twelve. Instead of explaining in great
detail the pressing nature of the busi
ness which had come up at the last
moment, requiring his immediate at
tention, he frankly confessed that he
had fallen in with a party of his pre
matrimonlal accomplices In villainy
and had enriched their exchequers to
the .extent of ten dollars and twenty
five cents in a pleasant little social
game of ten-call-twenty. As a result
he was persona non grata in his own
household until such a time as he had
appeased the wrath of the powers that
be with a diplomatic application of a
new hat and gown.
consider It a decidedly unfriendly act
and would at once sever diplomatic
relations with his own family until
such time as the cause of friction
should be removed. . Of course. Mrs.
Benedict reminded him that all men
were by nature and practice unmen
tionable brutes and that he was one of
the best specimens of the class now
in captivity and that furthermore her
dear mother should always be wel
come in the Benedict mansion and
should stay as long as might" seem de
sirable to the parties in interest. When
the matter was presented to him In
this aspect of sweet reasonableness
John Henry promptly withdrew from
his aggressive position and announced,
that any female ancestor of Mrs.
Benedict's was a firm friend of his. A3
a consequence of this particular piece
of truthfulness on John Henry's part
he was forced to hear his many short
comings pointed out to him by the
said - female ancestor morning and
night for six weeks.
This was the straw that changed the
whole current of John 'Henry's life, so
to speak. He had given the bright god
dess Truth the best chance In the
world to make good and she had ut
terly failed to deliver the goods as or
dered. He now determined to try what
a little Judicious diplomacy would do.
When an old and tried friend of his
youth blew in one afternpon and ex
pressed a desire to see how the town
looked after the lights were turned on.
John Henry called up Mrs. Benedict and
broke the news to her as gently as
possible that Jones of Kalamazoo vas
in town with a large consignment of
business that must be attended to be
fore the banks opened the n*ext morn
ing and for this reason he would be
unable to gladden his household with
his presence until a very late hour. The
only alloy of truth that this statement
contained was that there is such a
town as Kalamazooâ even the residents
admit thatâ and that there is probably
a man or two named Jones concealed
somewhere in the city directory of* the
place; the rest was a product of John
Henry's active Imagination- This fact.
(Copyright, 1903, by Albert -Britt.)
however, did not prevent Mrs. Bene
dict from falling on hi3 neck, meta-;
phorically speaking:, when he finally
showed up carrying a distinct aroma of
cloves about his person, and condoling
with him because he was so over
worked. Such had been John Henry's
hard experience with truth that he ac
cepted the tribute of sympathy without
even a symptom of a blush* "Â£â¢
The remainder of John Henry's ca
reer proved the wisdom of the new
policy which he had inaugurated. When
the suggestion was tentatively ad
vanced that another -visit from the an
cestor alluded to above was Impending,
he deftly evaded the invasion by point
ing out that when two people were so
happy together it was a pity to ring
in a non-union hand. "When a type
writer who could walk along the. street
without frightening- . the cab horses
settled down in John Henry's office, hs
never mentioned her and, from his con
versation, the casual observer might
have Inferred that . she never came
within the effective range of his ob
servation. The same rule was applied
to all the domestic crises and worked
like a charm, so that where once was
discord and dread war's alarms, un
alloyed peace and happiness, now
reigned. The white- winged dove of
peace elbowed the grim vlsaged god of
war off the nest and everything was
as lovely as a meeting- of the national
campaign committee.
In order to round out this domestic
Iliad, it is necessary to state that Mrs.
Benedict wad on to John Henry with
both feet all the time and. could tell
when he was lying without the aid of
a -microscope or a spirit level, but this
did not prevent her from attributing
his mendacity to a commendable de
sire to save her feelings, and In conse
quence John Henry received praise and
honeyed word3 where before all 'w is
stern censure and verbal missiles that
flew straight to the mark. All of which
goes to prove that as long as. truth
crushed to earth can.be counted on to
rise again, it isn't absolutely necessary
to be so everlastingly careful of It on
all occasions. : .

And so died the last of the royal line.

beautiful plumes to the pl_intiva chant

mor.ologist babbled cf farther isles and
wars, but ever all the raven of destiny
eroakod â¢'Nevermore."
"The King is deadâ long live the
King." What of the problem of govern
ment presented by these. islands to the
American nation? Seventy millions of
people living on the mainland think lit
tle and care little for the fate or the fu
ture of 150.000 dwellers in Hawaii, yet
the nation has a duty to perform to
ward them as trustee and guardian â a
duty which it may not neglect or shirk
without reproach.
As an American citizen I rejoice that
these islands are, for good or for evil,
under the Stars and Stripes, but I may
not disguise from myself that in the
manner of obtaining them we were
guilty of national larceny. The condi
tions were peculiar and pressing. The
sugar industry, in which was invested
millions of. American capital, was men
aced with a loss of the open American
market through a possible failure to re
new the reciprocity treaty. The alert,
aggressive, adroit Japanese were colo
nizing in vast numbers and it was
feared would vote themselves into pow
er, "Japanese" the government and
eventually annex it to the Mikado's
kingdom, and alb the material and
property Interests of the islands would.
as it then appeared, be promoted by
American annexation, and the misguid
ed Queen was threatening to change
the constitution so as to disfranchise
all but native Hawaftans or men who
had married native Hawaiians.
__________
The rights and wishes of the natives
seem to have been but slightly consult
ed. They loved their little, harmless
opera bouffe monarchy, with its fuss
and feathers. They believed tha-t Eng
land and France would protect them
from Japanese absorption. They were
not much Interested in an increase in
the market value of sugar stocks, or a
rise in town lots in Honolulu, for they
had parted with the best of their lands
and the best of their lots to white men.
They hafl not assimilated the spirit of
the great Saxon law of titles, which ap
plies to national as to independent pos
session: -'''I
This waÂ« the law of Ce-iric's baÂ»Â«.
The law of man to man. *T *-

They looked with enmity and distrust
upon those who "annexed" their coun

In the meantime, what are you going
to do with them? They constitute a
majority of the votes of the Territory.
They draw the color line against the
white man- and draw It sharply. They
elect legislators who will vote for no
law recommended by the Governor: leg

veto- any law he opposes, who will re
fuse to confirm his appointees, and who
have to be called in extra session be

reports in a communication to the
French Academy of Medicine. He says
he has employed it in the treatment
of such cases. The pain, he finds, is
relieved by. the action of the rays ~ on

paralysis was cured by two applications
of the new agent in only a slightly ac

London's* 'Phone Ss'Stem Is Poor.
LONDON. March 5.â An interesting
comparison^ English and American
telephone systems made this week
shows London to be * long way behind
New York! In the latter city an area of
429 square miles, with a population of
4,000,000, as against London's 640
square miles within â¢. poDUlation of
6, 500, 000. Is covered with no less than
200,000 wires, while this city, includ
ing the 15.000 postofflce lines, can
boast of only 80.000. Despite the fact
that London pays a proportionately
heavier rate for service, as regards
effltiency it certainly la not to bÂ« com
pared with New York.

The Intense interest that Lady Ran

manifesting itself in her son's actions.
Under her, influence her husband re
belled against his party and her son
is following an identical course. So
ciety people, who are somewhat envi
ous of the young man's political prom
inence, even go so far as to say that
his mother prepares his speeches. She
satisfies herself, x however, by discuss
ing with him the subject upon which
he 'has 'to speak before he makes any
important pronouncement. The po
sition he has: taken up over the\ fiscal
policy of Mr.' Chamberlain has caused
much trouble In the Marlborough

LONDON, March 5.â King Edward is
getting pretty sick of Sandringham as
a residence. He likes the surround
ings, but the house is a continual source
of annoyance to him. It was built
originally on the "jerry" principle and
the builders are never out of It. The
King, who Is a smart- business man,
has begun to think that If the place
were not looked upon as a kind of na
tional inheritance he would abandon it
to-morrow. The builder's men are in
there now, and his Majesty has had
to cover the expenses of the repairs
by insurance. The present situation in
regard to the estate appears to justify
Mr. Labouchere's statement when he
said that the sale was a piece of job
bery.' ,
While King Edward has been obliged
to practice retrenchment in many di
rections since he came to the throne,
he does not share the parsimonious pro
pensities of the late Queen. " The cus

"I am opposed to having school boys

about the world being made in seven
days is true, or that there is any. verac

BERLIN. March 5.â Professor De
litsch of "Babel and Bible" fame again
has come to the front with elaborate
objections to the present methods of
imparting religious instruction in the
schools. He. says:
"The findings in recent excavations
in Mesopotamia should be put before
school boys and girls. They should not
be brought up in ignorance of the re
sults of the late investigations into the
history of religion.
"Children should be taught that in
Genesis there are two divergent ac
counts of the creation, and that both
are the outcome of Babylonian myths.
About the flood they should^ be. taught
that the Biblical narrative is', also a
vestige of ancient Babylonian Xolklore.
"These ancient sagas should: be dug
out of the scripture books and given to
scholars at school or explained. If they
are not a day will come when the
grown-up man will throw them all over
and more besides, which" he should re

Among the many. Interesting Amer
icans invited to these radium parties
are Mrs. Howard Cockerell, the sister
of Lady Abinger, daughter of the cele
brated Commander Magruder of the
United States navy and the. niece of
General J. B. Magruder, who was com
mander of the ConfedeTate forces in
Texas during the Civil War; Mrs.
Lorillard and Miss Van Wart, who
is so â¢ well known in American
society. It Is said of Miss Van
Wart that she has refused Lalf the
British aristocracy. This society favor
ites has now taken a house in Curzon
Btreet, not far from the mansion newly
erected for the Duke and Duchess of
Marlborough, . and r.-hteh Is now fast
becoming an American colony.
Although members of the . exclusive
Bachelors' Club do not cease to be
Bachelors with a big B when th->
marry, they have to pay a penaltv of
one dozen bottles of champagne for
their fellow-members to drink j their
health with, each backslider feeling
that he is in the eyes of the club con
sidered a poor creature. The chairman,
of course, is alwavs a Bachelor in
every sense, Mr. Gillett being perhaps
one of the club's wealthiest member*.
Mr. Gillett's parties are always in
teresting events in London, for they
are held at the Bachelors' Club, one of
the most swagger clubs in London,
and of which Mr. Gillett la chairman.
One door, of this club opens on to Picca
dilly, but the ladies' entrance Is a little
way up Hamilton place. The clubrooma
of tbo members are so sacred that they
are never seen by the eyes of feminine
visitors, and when ladies, by some very
special Invitation, are allowed to enter
the clubhouse of these bachelor men.
they not only enter by this special door,
but ascend to rooms above by a spe
cial lift, or the special staircase, and
are entertained in special dining and
drawing rooms quite distinct from
f-ose Into which even men guests may
penetrate.
At Mr. Gillett's radium parties no^r
being held in London some of the
smartest American society women can
be ieen together. These novel and chic
functions are extremely exclusive, Mr.
Gillett limiting hia parties to 150 guests,
and no pleading on the part of his dear
est friend) would urge him to overstep
his number. Almost one-half of thÂ«
guests are well-known society women
from the United States, and it is com
mented that it is the American women,
who are most keenly interested and
who ask the most intelligent questions
of the professor there to explain thÂ«
powers and wonders of radium.
her husband and Winston Churchill
and his mother are having their re

GILLETT'S RADIUM PARTIES.
astonished me by, observing that 1 she
had met the late Queen Victoria five
years ago.
Nearly al! the, children. at the Vaude
ville Theater have been continuously
employed at salaries ranging from S" 50
to US weekly for the last four years,
and most of the girls wear little lockets
containing small pieces of cake which
formed part of the cake Queen Alexan
dra gave them personally when they
played in "Quality Street" at Windsor
Castle by royal command. The boys,
however, possess no such mementoes,
and on being questioned one sturdy lad
named Albert Valchera, who earns
$17 50 weekly, although he is not yet 13
years old, said: "That cake was too
good to stick in a locket. We ate all
ours quick, I can tell you."
Â¦Curiously enough, the boys when they
grow up seldom stick to the stage, but
go into business. The girls, however,
rarely quit the footlights and often be
come famous actresses. Ellen Terry,
Ellaline Terriss and many other cele
brities of the English stage started
their career as fairies in' pantomime
when 3 or 4 years old.
At the Vaudeville many of the chil
dren huve more important parts to
play, and are accomplished miniature
actors and actresses. They are all
well dressed and look clean, happy,
strong and well fed. Both boys and
girl? are remarkable for their good
locks, for only pretty children have any
chance of b*>ing engaged on the stage.
Th* educational authorities report that
th*- attainments and general knowledge
cf these little stage folk are quite equal
to 'hildren of the same age who at
tend school all day, and t\'. o are not
otherwise rmployed. It Is a strange
experience to hear children of 12 and
13 talking with a grave professional
air of th*>ir engagements, the news
paper notices they have received and
the celebrities they have met. The
girls. In particular, are precocious, as a
rule, although wel! behaved, and seem
: : ke young women of 22. with the bodies
of little children. The stage, however,
nan no effect, one schoolmistress sor
rowfully remarked, in changing the na
lur* of the boys. They were as trouble

PROUD OF ACQUAINTANCES.
One little fr.ir-haired girl named
riefcie Campbell, aped 13 years, told the
writer Khe had J>een on the stage for
five years, during which period she had
w-tM with Mrs. Patrick Campbell,
FVrbes Robertson. Seymour Hicks and
L.-aline Terriss. She w as once at a

shook hands with her and gavÂ« her a

Dormouse in -Alice in Wonderland"
ALL BRIGHT AND CHEERFUL.
At Drury Lane Theater, the world's
headquarters of pantomime, over 400
children are employed for the present
run of "Humpty Dumpty," and 130
come within the school attendance age
and spend their three hours every
morning in the schoolroom, which is
fitted up at the back of the enormous
stage whereon so many great actors
have played in pÂ«st generations. This
room is provided with all the acces
sories to make it look as much like au
ordinary day schoolroom as possible,
jind the system of education is similar
to that of an ordinary school. The
children are divided into grades ac
cording to their educational attain
ments, and they have their lessons set
them by a certfficated schoolma'am.
Their hours are from 9 a. m. to 12,
and four days a week are devoted to
reading, history, writing and arithme
tic. The remaining days are devoted
to special subjects, such as geography,
map drawing and English literature.
The rudiments of music and physical
drill are not taught to stage children
by the school board authorities, as
they receive instruction while rehears
ing their parts in these departments
of education.
Very few of the children at Drury
Lane have speaking parts. Most of
them take the parts of toys, birds and
insects in the ballets, work for which
they receive, for an afternoon and
evening performance daily, a sum rang
ing from 52 50 vjo $5 a week.
LONDON. March 5.â Any privileged
person being: permitted to roam through
the mysterious places back of the stage
of famous old Drury Lane Theater or
of any one of a dozen other London
playhouses at present would be likely
to stumble on a scene that .would as
tonish him mightily. In the last place,
if one would think of looking for it, he
would find a children's school in full
blastâ maps on the walls, blackboards
here and there, a sedate teacher on the
platform and a hundred children, more
than ordinarily bright and graceful,
bending their heads over their desks
Just as if the etrange paraphernalia of
pantomime all around them and the
children themselves were not a part of
the show.
The anomaly is due to the fact that
Parliament has taken a hand in the
atrical management
At the beginning of this year 2730
children under 14 years were employed
in the English theaters, chiefly in pan
tomime. But Parliament decided that
such employment was a bad thing for
the children unless their education
could be guaranteed, and refused to
jErant the necessary licenses unless the
theatrical managers undertook to see
that their youthful actors and actresses
got some schooling in other branches of
education than mumming. "All these
children who are under 11," said the
paternal Government, "must spend
three hours a day in school."

"Out of the whole number of plays
sent in seventeen were selected for mt
to read: and I read them with the ui
most care and impartiality. Of these
seventeen Mr. Seymour and myself set
aside five, which we considered to be
distinctly the best; of these, five, which
we then read over the second time, we
selected two as being distinctly bet
ter than the other three; we then reaa
these, two a third time, and agreed
without the slightest discussion that
the one which most nearly filled tht
required conditions was 'The Triumph
of Love.' I say this to show that the
selection was not made hastily.
"No one will venture to say that Mr.
Seymour is not a competent judge ot
plays from a theatrical point of view.
It was more especially my duty, I un
derstand, to judge of the literary mer
its of the work chosen. With regard
to this I have nothing to say as to my
own competency.

that there was never any difference of

self. Our duties, voluntarily under

choice was made. Those who doubt
that this choice was wise may possibly
obtain the privilege of reading between

has the rizht to doubt that it was

such sounds of thunder, such amazlns

here, but he Is, besides, a masterly
leader of men. who has his musicians
under perfect control, Â¦ insomuch that
everything is played with wonderful
effectiveness, with force, sympathy and
nice discrimination. It leans to cli

On his way to San Francisco Harold
Bauer was by way of giving a con
cert in the wilds of. Arizonaâ In Phoe
nix, to be particular. The pianist's
programme, it is related, was to be a
request one. Naturally the event
aroused large interest among the local
musicians, whose numbers, however,
are small compared with the prevailing
Indian and burro. Of which more later.
But the musicians, as the Phoenix re
porters say. made Â¦ up in enthusiasm
what they lacked in numbers and pre
pared to do their swelle3t. The bis
chief after much pondering preferred
the following request, the Fifth Sym
phony of Beethoven, the intermezzo
from "Cavalleria Rusticana" and the
Schubert-Tausisr "Marche Militaire"â
the tag end of the memory of a Car
reno holiday doubtless. The last two
mattered not, the request ran patheti
cally, but the Fifth Symphony the gen
tlemen must have! As Mr. Bauer es
caped with his boots he must have
found some other means of pacifying
the symphonic passion of Phoenix.
Here is the programme he did give,
with 500 Indian children In the audi
ence. The hall promised to be too large
for the two musicians of Phoenix, and
Mr. Bauer invited the Indians to en-
Joy the feast. I asked him why the
classical programme. "No other kind
would have been any fun," he said.

A recent Issue of Pearson's Magazine
contained the following expression from
Charles B. Sanford In response to the
question, "Why does Shakespeare ap
peal to actor and audience?":
"To my mind the potency with which
Shakespeare appeals both to actor and
audience defies close analysis; It is
something of the same appeal which
the beauty of a landscape, the bril
liancy of the star-lighted heavens or
the blending magnificence of a sunset
sky exerts. Yet thl3 much is sure
human beings feel the closest and most
intense interest in the doings of one
another. The same curiosity which in
spires humbler minds to wonder what
the neighbors are having for dinner
moves the student to apply himself to
the folk-lore of savages and the deci
phering of cuneiform inscriptions. It is
Shakespeare's close and truthful Inter
pretation of human nature, even more
than' the splendid poetry with which
his thoughts are expressed, that stimu
lates the enthusiasm of the actor and
calls forth the rar>t attention of the
auditor. Shakespeare's appeal both to
actor and audience rests upon the fact
that he has written himself as one who
loved his fellow men."

It was impossible not to suspect Mr.
Bauer from the first â of being a great
man. A groat pianist I was prepared to
find; the great man is another story.
By the grace of the pianist's local man
ager Mr. Bauer consented to chat with
me on Tuesday afternoon last in h!a
rooms at the Princeton. It took the in
terviewer â r.o miracle â Just two min
utes to find him out. The very fashion
of his posing, "standing in" to help
with the possible shifting of a piano,
taking this and that attitude with ut
most simplicity and directness, of his
fjuaint advice to the camera man
aeainst a. profile, pave Mr. Bauer com
pletely away. Later moments con
fumed the diagnosis, and mine Is the
fault if he does not so appear here.
There are times whenâ say Plerpont
Morgan's berth, or any other â has at
tractions for the Interviewer. Such
momenta as Mr. Bauer granted me on
Tuesday last are not of them. For,
kok you, reverence is a rare and gra
cious privilege. The mighty little folk
of the earth â God bless us â are forever
persuading to the uselessness of things,
the droll, pitiable, stupendous littleness
of one's kind. But lo, behold the
prophet, the 6pire on the horizon, the
lifted eye and life gathers meaning even
unto a god!
I'm sure I did not mean to cast Mr.
Bauer as a spire. Doubtless, too, no
one will be more amused thereat than
the modest pianist, for he has amply
this grace of genius. But so he looms
up to me, on the somewhat Dutch hori
zon of our late music.
The photographic maneuvers gave
me valued opportunity to take In Mr.
Bauer's characteristic outside. Natur
ally one made first for his hair! There
is much of it, curled like Bacchus', and
colored like sunned bronze. It fits ad
mirably a face consistently merry out
side of camera limits, eyes droll and
brown â that disappear in the frequent
smile, the sensuous under lip. The
other Bauer is no less evident in the
firm chin, broad, thinker's brow, the
Napoleonic nose. I was later to hear
the square, delicate fingers on the keya,
by which they were lying, and for tnÂ«
r<-Ft Mr. Bauer is neither short nor
tall, but generously and sturdily filled
in and radiantly wholesome of person
ality. He left the piano stool for a
sumptuously cushioned rocker when the
artist left us and asked the fitting
cigarette.
"Of course," I began, "I want to
know most how you came to desert the
violin for the piano, Mr. Bauer?"
The pianist, it is well known, was a
wender-child violinist, and until ten
years ago was known by his fiddling.
'It is a long story," the pianist pre
faced. "Can you really stand it?
Think first."
To very sure I can." I laughed.'
He asked then, "Does it really seem
very stranj?e. to you?"
"Deserting the violin for the piano?
Yes." I replied. It is to be remem
bered that I had not then heard the
orchestral pianism of Mr. Bauer.
"But why?"
"But, monsieur, you interview me!
Oh, of course, because of the greater
responsiveness of the vioiin. its near
ness to the voice, because there is so
much less between one and the music
with the violin."
"There is more than mere perfection
of tone involved." Mr. Bauer leaned
forward to emphasize. "With the vio
lin one has to deal mostly with single
line. Harmony, for the single player,
is lacking. The effects are necessarily
limited. Then look at the repertoire.
What have you? Look at the concer
tos, fine as they are, Mendelssohn,
Max Bruch, Beethoven, how many are
there? And the sonatas. There's
Bach, Beethoven, and after them
what? Mostly inferior stuff. There
is something that cries out for more
after a time."
I grasped a little as I looked at this
new Alexander, so charmingly simple
in his imperial ambition, and queried.
So it is the larger world of the piano
that appealed?"
"Exactly." he nodded. "A lifetime
is not long enough to know it. Of
< ourse, the violin does come closer to
the voice â the ideal music. And the
string quartet comes nearer perfection
than any other Instrumental music.
But I've done all that. I suppose I
could sit and play any of the quar
tets by heart even now â the notes,
you know." Mr. Bauer announced
this with quite the air of pride I
should assume in claiming that I
could read the* morning paper!
"But you are glad that you can play
them ?"
"Ah, yes!" he said heartily. Isn't
there yet another world unesploited,
Mr. Bauer? Your vibrant barytone

He lighted anotner cigarette to the
story, and first repeating his question:
"You really want to know? It is a
rambling sort of tale. But I always
dabblei with the piano, you know. My
sister is a good pianist, and there was
always all sorts of music round at
home. A teacher I knew used to give
me hintsâ I saw him only irregularlyâ
and I courageously tried everything
in sight. It was never serious though.
I was studying always the violin, play
fug in public, and without the slightest
intention of being anything but a vio
linist."
"Where were you studying?"
"In London, my home, with Pollitzer
âprobably the most successful violin
teacher there. Well, then"â he smiled
at the reminiscence â "one day my
friend of the piano sent me to play
a second piano for Paderewski, who
always practiced his concertos with him
In London. Of course I went. Natur
ally, Paderewskl assumed that I was
a pianist, and asked me afterward to
play some solos for himâ just out of
kindness. I told h^m I couldn't, of
course, and then told him I was a vio
linist. He was Interested, and asked
me to come over to Paris and play
for him if I decided to leave the vio
lin for the piano â and he rather advised
it."
"And so it was decided?"
"Not at all." the pianist laughed. "I
never thought of It then. But I went
to Paris soon afterward and decided
forty-eight hours after I got there that
it should be my home forever. That
meant starving Just thenâ those garret
stories are occasionally true"â they
might be as humorous as true from
Mr. Bauer's keenly apparent delight
In the memory of his own garret days.
He looks backward, not unimportantly,
over a goodly shoulder.
"Latin quarter?" I asked.
"Latin quarter." he nodded. "I
wouldn't have missed it for anything.
You mustn't take the starving too Be
riously; we sponged N on our friends
when we were hungryâ and when they
were not sponging on us."
"Oh, Colline, and Schaunard, and Ru
dolf!" I laughed.
'But we did starve for cigarettes.
That is why"â "he looked with droll
tenderness at the one In his handâ
"that is why we value them so highly
now. "We used to keep the ends in
a tin box and smoke them. Got them
strong to make them go further. But
It was really a very happy time.
Achille Rivarde. the violinist, he has
been here â "
"I remember him."
"Lived with me. I gave violin les
sons for the pot-au-feu, and studied
the violin steadily for a year; the piano
also for fun."
"With Paderewskl V
"No. 1 saw very little of him that
year. He was away on tour a great
deal. But I played for him when he
was in Paris, and you can understand
profited a great deal. But by sheer
hazard it came my way to go with a
singer to Russia as a pianist, her own
accompanist having disappeared. I
would have done anything, you know,
and accepted joyfully. There were fifty
concerts in four monrths. Still the af
fair was simply a little Joke musicallyâ
nc-t as to the pot-au-feu.. Then came
a violinist of the Lamoureux orchestra
with a demand that I should play
piano for him. Then the leading Lamou
reux cellist invited me to be the pianist
at some concerts of his. I wanted to
play the violin, but he insisted on my
playing piano. Some are born pianists,
you see; others have the piano thrust
upon them. It was the same afterward,
another singer, then another violinist."
"Fate â "
"Apparently, yes. My experience is
probably unique. If" â Mr. Bauer spec
ulated through the pleasant haze of his
cigaretteâ "if I had not been hard up,
if my teacher in London had not one
day been ill, ifâ it's all ifâ it might
have happened that I should not have
been a pianist. Of course, then I began
to play seriously."
"Some of us were trying the other
day to put piano playing into a sen
tence," I remarked here. "Is this a
complete definition 'to play the right
notes in the right time with the right
weight?' "
"Ah! That's very interesting," the
pianist said. He leaned forward to look
with a keen impersonal scrutiny at the
definer. "The right notes, in the right
time, with the right weight, you said?
It is â nothing else."
"But some of us feel that there IS an
immaterial something else," I ventured.
"Look at the deadly ugliness of the me
chanical piano."
"No, there is nothing else," Mr. Bauer
said slowly. He went to the piano and
struck harshjy a note and its neighbor
to illustrate. "The mechanical piano
has only this touch, from the top to
the bottom of the sound. That is why
it is so ludicrously imperfect. The fin
ger" â he 'struck, caressed, stroked the
note until it purred and saner luscious
ly, never reaching the hard bottom of
it, nor touching its sharp upper edge â
"the finger has all sorts of possibilities.
But the difference is ALL WEIGHT.
It can be only louder or softer. Give the
same dynamic capacities to the me-,
chanitfal piano and your result would
be the same."
**I3ut one feels " â¢
"I'm afraid it is shocking to say that
I think there is nothing immaterial
about piano playing," and Mr. Bauer
shook back his bronze locks and
laughed most infectiously. "It is exact
ly what you say, 'the right notes, the
right time and the right weight.' One
feels that it is derogatory to the art to
take away some mysterious magic fluid
â whatever you like to call it. Not so;
the further you can go in analysis the
more respect one should have for the
art. Such bricks from such straw!"
Somehow, then programme music
came up, with the question of whether
it was possible for a piece of music to
suggest a definite idea. Wagner's leit
motif, of course, suggested itself.
"Of course, association plays a large
part in programme music. For exam
pleâWhy dees the king theme in 'Loh
engrin' suggest a king? It is the com
mon chord, with trumpets, and the her
alds never play anything but common
chords on trumpets. The Elsa theme is
more subtle, yet also with a physical
basis." He sprang to the piano, played
it. then sang it, dropping his head with
the despairing last notes. "Is any one
coming to my defense? No, there is no
one." he quoted.'
"The Rheingold prelude suggests
water amazingly," I recall, "only one
chordâ"
"Only one water," Bauer phrased it;
"one water, with the light and play on
the surface; the melody" â he played it
â then some measures of the "Marchen
von der Schonen Melusine," *of Men
delssohn; "the same subject, same
treatment. This again is asso
ciation, and something more," ho
went on, this time the "Siegfried"
sword theme. "Your common chord
gives the effect of force, the final for
eign note the piercing effect â but you
must not let me talk of these things; It
is my hobby."
"Exactly what I want, Mr. Bauer."
Th^n in keen and subtle fashion the
pianist analyzed for me the reason
why the funeral march is the most eas
ily recognizable of movements: why.it
Is so singularly similar in character.

Time was when a well dressed man
was -regarded with suspicion out here
in the -.West â and justly so, because he
usually was, a gambler and confidence
manâ but that era is Rast, and dress
has come to be an ind*ex of a man's
personality and his degree of prosper
ity â likewise his social status. To be
sure. , many wolves wear gentlemen's
clothes, but that in itself is a tribute to
the gentleman. There is not an up-to
date man or woman to-day who does
not admire a well groomed" and well
dressed man. Here's to him!
And "what a carelessness" â our
friend Dill would say â as to creases in
trousers, set' of coat, ohoice of neck
wear, and usage of gloves! In New
York, Buffalo, Philadelphia, Washing
ton and Denver business and profes
sional men have standards of dress
that reflect much credit upon them and
unlimited admiration from the women
folk â and we would that our men, than
whom there are no dearer in the world,
would only get busy and do likewise.

' WASHINGTON, March/5.â
According to a diplomat at the
Russian embassy, the most im
portant phase of the Far Eastern
question is still the attitude of
China. To Russians' the presence
of the Chinese army under Gen
eral Ma, and General Yuan Shi
Kai, now massed near the Man
churian border, - consisting of the
flower of the Chinese forces, is a
constant menace. The Chinese at
all times are in a position to turn
the Russian flank and threaten its
rear. Should the desire of China
to re-establish itself in Manchuria
become predominant to the point
of helping Japan to expel Russia
from Manchuria, there is only
one action possible under the Hay
note â a union of neutral powers
to- compel the neutrality of China.
Such a necessity might threaten
the integrity of the empire.
It is not believed at the Rus
sian Â¦ embassy that Japan has
taken any steps to secure the as
sistance of China in the war. At
the State Department this point
is emphasized. Japan is believed
to sincerely wish the preservation
of the Chinese- empire in prefef-

tiful girl, died suddenly last evening at
her home. Mrs. Gradilla and other
relatives went to the residence to-day
to care, for the dead and comfort the
living.
While seated beside the dead body
and in the presence of the other
mourners Mrs. Gradilla was suddenly
stricken with heart disease. Death
was instantaneous.- She was 41 years
of age and leaves six children and a
husband. .
Dolores was the favorite sister of
Mrs. Gradilla and grief is considered
to have been the cause of the second
death. ,

"At about 10:10 I was on a Fourth-

when I heard what I took to be a pis

The door opening into Buttgenbach's
private office is on the south side of
the store. It Is pf plain glass, as is
also the partition on the east side of
the office. It is through this glass the
bullet was fired. It would easily be
possible for a person" to rush into the
Khipley-Btreet door, fire a shot through
this glass partition and enter the inner
office. The whole .general interior of
the place, however, 's plainly visible
from Fourth street, as the front is
closed only with telescoping Iron doors
and a. light Is kept burning. At the
time of the shooting the street was
filled with passers-by, yet none wit
nessed the brief, but fatal struggle.
One or the first to arrive on the
scene was Sergeant Green of the
Southern Police Station, who was re
porting on for duty. He heard the shot
fired and immediately sprang from the
car and rushed to the scene. His
story is as follows:
He rushed through the outer of
fice, where his father was. at work,
he says, and into the inner one, burst
through a. thin board partition into a
neighboring sa!oon . ar>d. . co;iÂ£idered
himself safe. The bookkeeper, Brune,
at work in the inner office,- oaught the
infection of terror and fled precipitate

According to his first statement he did
not see the intruders, but later he told
the offlcers that he. heard .a scuffle, a
crashing of glass and saw the old man
on the floor struggling with a stranger.
He then gave the alarm.

According to the statements of Al
Buttgrenbaeh and Louis Brune, first
made to the police, they were fright
ened out of their wits and left the old
man to grapple alone with two des
perate thugs. ; Al v.as on his way
home and while passing down Shipley
street two men attempted to hold him

the side door of the establishment,

TEI.I, STORY OF THUGS.
Just prior to closing his place of busi
ness last night Joseph Buttgenbach,
head of the Pacific Packing Company,
at Fourth and Shipley streets, was shot
Â«uid fat^.:ly injured by unknown assail
ants. He was taken in a dying condi
tion to the Central Emergency Hos
pital, and his son Al and his book
keeper, Louis Urune. were held fcrr ob
servation, pending a thorough investi
gation. Although from the statements
of these two the shooting was done by
a pair of desperate thugs, there is much
to be explained. If. as Brune and the
younger Butigenbach claim, Mr..Butt
genbach v.as fatally injured only after
a desperate struggle with two thugs,
it seems strange that the robbers left
the place without molesting a bag of
eTold coiii, containing approximately
$300, which had not yet been placed
in the safe, besides $70 in gold and
silver which Mr. Buttgenbach was
counting at the time of the murderous
assault. Who the murderer was or
what his motive is a mystery for the
police to unravel. Detectives Bunner
and Freel, u ho are working on the
case, incline to the belief that the crime
was committed by membeis of the nu
merous gengs ot" hold-up men who are
at present infesting the city. This
makes an easy sc-lution to the prob
lem, as the crime can-be laid at the
doors of the proverbial tall man and
short man.
Cromwell, who has been in this city
this week in conference with the Gov
ernment officials, denied to-night that
there was any serious drawback In
completing the canal transactions.
While no one would say to-night just
exactly what the hitch was, it was un
derstood that certain suits against the
new Panama Canal Company have not
yet been cleared up torthe satisfaction
of this Government and the title can
not yet be given. '
. WASHINGTON, March 5.â There is
a hitch in the completion of the Pan
ama canal negotiations. . Just as the
United States Government was about
to pay over $10,000,000 ; to J. 1 P." Morgan
& Co., as the fiscal agents Â¦ of the re
public of Panama on Thursday, Attor
ney General Kriox halted the proceed
ings by saying the final deal with the
,Panama Canal Company would .not be
i e6$yÂ«ieitl u 'wlth William Nelson Crom
well, its counsel. Before this can be
done Cromwelf^rnust take: a; trip to
Paris to obtain ' more authority and
complete certain, legal technicalities
which the law officers and this Gov
ernment have suddenly found to be
necessary. . Cromwell has ! been given
until March 25 to perfect the transac
tion. '
This new situation, developing as' it
did, just as Panama was about", to be
paid Its $10,000,000 and as this Govern
ment had announced Its readiness .to
pay $40,000,000 to the French company,
has caused great surprise and. disap
pointment to the United States offi
cials. Cromwell, as the legal represen
tative of the company, has repeatedly
told the members of the Cabinet while
the treaty was pending that he had
the necessary authority and would be
ready to turn over proper title to the
property as scon as the treaty ratifi
cations were exchanged. This Govern
ment took Cromwell at his word and
made preparations to pay the canal
company and the new republic.

just ended as one in which much
has been done to guarantee the
continued peace of Europe. The
press is authorized to say. how
ever, that the rumors that France,
Great Britain or any other
power is contemplating interven
tion or the taking of any steps
with the idea of ending the war
are quite baseless. The frequent
visits of Cambon, the French Em
bassador. to Foreign Minister
Lansdowne this week have had
no connection with the present
war. The "treaty now on the verge
of conclusion to settle long-stand

Britain and France on colonial

for answering Russia's ebars?e. For
the present, however, he said it had
that the forty-five Russian vessels in
home waters will be in position by
June to proceed, if necessary, to Far
Eastern stations, taking with them the
American Invention which will enable
the war vessels to proceed without
running afoul of the regulations at
neutral ports regarding coal.
The. amendment proposed by
Quarles to the committee amendment
for a naval station on the, Great
Lakes was then .taken up. Hopkins
moved to lay it on the table. -That
motion was voted down. The amend
ment to the amendment was accept
ed and the original amendment as
amended was agreed to. -> T
Nelson took the floor to reply to
Hale, who, he said, had taken him to
task for violating the principles of
neutrality because he had said that
our commercial interests were com
mon to those of Japan.
"And," he went on, "In the same
breath In which he criticized me, he
commerce was in from 'ambitious
Japan.' I submit that if there was
any violation of the principles of neu
trality on my part, there was an equal
ly marked violation by him."
Nelson said that he had not intend
ed to imply that the United States
should take any other than a neutral
position In the Oriental war, for he
held no such position. He did con
tend, however, that we should take
all proper steps to protect our .com
merce in the Orient and he thought
the navy should be adequate to that
service.
"The difference between the Sena
tor's position then and now," replied
Carmack, "is that, not being a Sena
tor, he was considering the case, as a
patriot and had not taken the case as
a criminal lawyer to defend the Re
publican, party."
Carmack agreed with Hale that if
China should fall under the dominion
of Japan it would be very doubtful
whether the United States would de
rive any advantages from it.
Carmack read an extract from a
newspaper, saying $435,000 had been
expended for the purpose of keeping
the two pleasure yachts, the May
flower and the Sylrih, in condition for
the President's . use. This, he con
tended, was a misappropriation.
NELSON ANSWERS HALE.
DEPEW'S CHANGE OF VIEW.
Carmack referred to Depew's de
fense of the retention of * the Philip
pines "and quoted a previous utterance
by that Senator, taking an opposite
position. Depew arose, saying:
"That Chauncey Depew is dead. I
was not then a Senator, but simply a
New Yorker, making speeches almost
every night, and giving very little
thought to them."
After studying the question he had
changed his views. He originally had
been a Democrat and his first impres
sions were generally Democratic.
Gorman then gave his attention to
the statement of Lodge that a large
navy was a conservator of peace, say
ing that this declaration was con
trary to the conviction of the fathers.
He differed from Lodge in considering
this an aggressive nation. He hoped
the time would soon come when the
people would return ;to the Demo
cratic-Republican doctrine that our
power was not measured by the num
ber of guns afloat nor by the number
of uniforms we had. He would not
have a Republican or a Democratic
navy, but an American navy, and he
would have the credit given to the
men who fight the battles, as was
done in the case of Perry, and not
have them sent to the rear and hu
miliated for their very achievements.
"If we were at war," said Gorman,
"if our commerce were threatened by
war, we would give the Secretary of
the Navy all that he could spend. But
all the country knows that these mil
lions, these billions, have done more
to demoralize than otherwise."
Extravagance had been the inevit
able result and a brief war with Spain
had cost the country a billion dollars.
He had no sympathy with any
movement against China.' No matter
what nation might secure supremacy
in that country the United States
would secure its share of Its com
merce. He said that every American
had gloried in the part .the United
States had taken in checking the
Boxer uprising and that if that ex
ample were to^be followed it would
do more than any number of ships to
improve our commerce.
Gorman congratulated Hale on his
conduct of naval legislation in the Sen
ate. He reviewed the growth of the
navy, saying that when Mr. Whitney
took charge of the Navy Department
it was in very bad condition; but not
withstanding the Republicans were in
the majority in the Senate it had not
been necessary to make a second'ap
peal either to Hale or Allison. Up to
the present time there" had % been no
division on party lines. As for him
self, he always had expressed his
sentiments freely' without regard to
party lines. He criticized Moody as
imprudent in charging the Democratic
party with partisanship because of
his (Gorman's) attitude. He had
srpoken for himself, in saying the ad
ministration was advancing too rap
idly and had gone too far in the In
crease of the navy.
"Executive officers," said Gorman
slowly and with deliberate emphasis,
"would serve their country better if
they attended to the details of their
efflces and abstained from criticisms
of Senators and members of Con
gress."
GORMAN OPPOSES BILL.
sea, and the result could not be fore
told.
Depew predicted thafin the end-Jo
seph Chamberlain would succeed in the
programme laid out by him in Great
Britain. Other European najtions would
be found taking steps to protect them
selves against us, and a navy would be
needed. He said that, whatever side
was victorious in the Eastern war, the
United States must be consulted, and
this country would insist on Raving
her interests considered before China
could be divided. A great navy would
be necessary at such a time.
Replying to Patterson, he said he did
not think it would be necessary to go
to war to maintain our interests in the
Orient.
"Why are the other powers' now ac-
When the naval . appropriation bill
was taken up Clay took issue with the
contentions of Lodge and Depew as to
the necessity for a strong fighting sea
force to keep the United States out of
war. Clay contended that there should
be a Congressional committee to inves
tigate expenditures in the departments,
saying that uo business man would let
business involving millions drift along
as Congress was doing. He criticized
the policy that led to the expenditure
of $207,000,000 annually for war and re
fused to erect public buildings in Wash
ington that would save rents of $300,000
a year.
Martin (Democrat), a member of the
Committee on Naval Affairs, defended
the bill. "We must have a strong
navy," he said, and he instanced the
recent^ expansion of the .United States
as supplying the reason for this neces
sity. He referred to the possibility of
France and Great Britain being drawn
Into the Oriental war because of their
respective alliances with Russia and
Japan, and while he did not believe
that the United States would become
Involved, he did not consider it the part
of wisdom to be unprepared.
Depew spoke of the policy of expan
sion,, and Patterson inquired whether
he meant that further aggrandizement
through conquest or purchase of for
eign, territory would be the programme
of this Government: '. .
"I do not' think we will ever see the
time when. wjo.ttIU: need "more terri
tory," said Depew, "but I. do think we
will get a merchant marine some time,
and I mean that we will want a navy
big enough to protect It. . I mean that
I hope Secretary Hay's programme for
an open door in China will continue to
be a policy of this Government, and
thft we should have a navy big enough
to enforce it."
THIS NATION'S ATTITUDE.
WASHINGTON, March 5.â There was
an interesting exchange of views in the
Senate to-day Detween .Nelson and
Hale. The Minnesota Senator in the
course of a brief colloquy with Patter
sen concerning features of the naval
appropriation bill expressed the opin
ion that there was such a community
of interests on the part of the United
States, Great Britain and Japan as to
protect China against dismemberment.
To this statement Hale, in charge of
the bill, objected sharply, saying that
the position of the United States in the
present Oriental war was that of neu
trality, and that he could not allow to
go unchallenged any statement in the
Senate indicating a national interest in
either Russia or Japan. Nelson respond
ed by saying Hale had indicated as
great partiality for Russia as he (Nel
son) >had expressed for Japan.
The discussion to-day was entirely on
political lines and was participated In
by Hale, Depew and Nelson on the Re
publican side, and by Gorman, Clay,
Martin, Patterson and Bacon on the
Democratic side.
CLAY OPENS THE DEBATE.
Depew defended President Roose
velt against the charge of impetuos
ity and recklessness, saying that if he
had had the disposition to make trou
ble he could have found it in the Ca
nadian dispute.
"A less wise man would have seen
and seized the opportunity to appeal
to the popular sentiment," he said.
"Instead of doing this, the President
appealed to arbitration, and in view
of the result we owe him a lasting
debt of gratitude for the wisdom awl
patriotism displayed."
Depew said he had been appointed
Minister to "Japan thirty-eight ye.irs
ago and i that In those thirty-eigh.t
years Japan had progressed as much
as Europe had progressed in the last
600 years. If her contest with Russia
was to be on land Japan would be
nowhere,. but the light must be on the
: Continuing, Depew said that Nelson
openly had expressed his partiality for
Japan, while Hale almost as plainly
had indicated his leaning toward Rus
sia. As, for. Patterson, he had mani
fested the usual "Democratic tendency
toward expediency by- standing ready
to take advantage of the . situation,
whichever side might win. He agreed
with Hale, as to the wisdom of Hale's
attitude; "but," he said, "the fact re
mains that every man," woman and
child in the United States is lined up
on one side or the other,' as they are
whenever there is a fight."
He added that the President's
proclamation announced our . official
attitude, but said that behind that we
could say what we pleased as indi
viduals. . â¢
DEFENDS THE PRESIDENT.
Resuming his speech, Depew denied
that the Hay note had been inspired by
Germany. He spoke of it as a revela
tion, and said that the Denver News
must have direct Marconi communica
tion; with the palace at Potsdam.
Patterson replied that the state
ment had been carried by the Asso
ciated Press, as Depew should have
known, if. a * general 'reader of the
newspapers.
He said that it Japan be successful in
the present war the United States
would find herself in more danger in
commercial matters from that ambi
tious power than any other. He (Hale)
considered the Oriental trade as of com
paratively little importance. If we had
not been Involved with predatory na
tions, in invading China even the Chi
nese Boxers would have protected our
interests in China. He was not in favor
of any policy that Involved us in the
expense, in the enormous wickedness,
of the war so far away from our shores.
cepting a very unpopular note from
us?" he asked.
Patterson called attention to the re
port t,hat the note to Russia and Japan
had been incited by Germany.
Nelson replied to Patterson's ques
tions concerning our naval influence in
the East, saying that, with this coun
try, Great Britain and Japa'n all united
in support of an open door in China
there was no danger of the dismember
ment of China. All, too, were hostile to
the absorption of Manchuria. He did
not believe there was any formal' alli
ance â only mutuality of interest.
HALE CHALLENGES STATEMENT.
Hale protested that this debate was
extraneous. \
"I do not want the statement of the
Senator from Minnesota to* go unchal
lenged," he said. "I do not agree that
there is to-day any such common inter
est between the* United States, Great
Britain and Japan on the one side,
against Russia, France' and other pow
ers, as his statement implies. Our at
titude is one of neutrality, and so de
clared by our State Department. The
statement that we have a common in
terest with Japan and Great Britain
as to Manchuria I can't let go without
a challenge.. We are riot against Japan,
nor must it. be said that all our inter
ests are with her. and against Russia
and other continental European pow
ers."

it is not believed likely that other
nations will deem it wise to com

urging the Russian contention

Baron Hayashi, the Japanese

Death Comes After n Short Illness.
SALINAS, March 5.â John G. Ana
strong, a native of New York, aged*!)
years, and for more than thirty-six
years a resident of the Salinas Valley
near Blanco, died this morning after a
short illness. The deceased, who was
well known throughout the State, was
very wealthy and leaves a valuable es
tate to his wife, two sons and ono
daughter.
of Northern Korea are not con
sidered important, the absence of
roads . preventing these forces
combining with the main body.
The Cossacks, mounted in
fantry and light guns now across
the Yalu River will serve to har
ass the enemy in every possible
way, as well as to hold him in
check until the Russian main
armies and reserves are concen
trated and disposed. Sharp fight
ing may occur between the ad
vance parties, but nothing of a
decisive character is expected.
The Russian plans contemplate
taking no chances on the score of
inferior numbers. By sheer
weight of men and guns, if noth
ing else, when the proper time
arrives, Russia counts on over
whelming the Japanese and roll
ing them back through Korea. It
is realized that the vastness of the
theater of war will make the pro
tection of the railroads, the sole
means for the transportation of
troops and supplies from Europe,
one of the most difficult phases of
the Russian military problem.
With the Japanese in command of
the sea, there is always the pos
sibility of their landing small bod
ies of men in unexpected places to
make incursions into the interior
to cut the railroad and telegraph
lines and blow up bridges, but
adequate measures are believed to
have been taken to guard against
such misfortune.
It is. a mistake to suppose that
the Russians underestimate the
prowess of their adversaries. On
the contrary, they admit the fine
markmanship of the Japanese and
their marvelous ability to deter
mine ranges; yet the Russians do
not believe that the Japanese can
successfully face the legions of
the Czar. On the sea the mari
time life of the Japanese gives
them a natural advantage, but on
land, where belong all the tradi
tions of the Russian army,, the
men of the empire have perfect
faith, born of their numerous ex
periences with pagan tribes and
the fatalism inherent in the Rus
sian character. ; They believe that
Asiatics cannot meet Europeans
in battle array ; that a yellow
race cannot triumph over a white,
or heathens over Christians.

ten times that number crowded the
Doric's decks for the purpose of cheer
ing on the patriots. Japanese orators
mounted the hurricane deck, gave the
Czar a verbal lambasting and uttered
graceful tributes to the brave war
riors who had discarded the fleshpots
of America for the soldier's portion on
the campaign ground. A band, un
musical but loud, played patriotic airs
and at irregular intervals every . Jap
anese raised hia voice In the Asiatic
equivalent for a cheer.
Colonel E. H. Crowder and Captain
Peyton C. March; who have been de
tailed to follow the fortunes of the
Japanese army j for the benefit of the
American service, sailed on the liner,

Hegardt and Henry Lindberg, who

The Russians who recently returned

who favor an alliance with. Japan. The
Japanese Minister, on being notified of
this, immediately informed the Korean
Government that if it did not arrest
the conspirators the Japanese officials
would do, so. As a result four leaders
of the peddlers h,ave been arrested.
The Cabinet decided to-day to re
open the railroad between Yongampho
and Wiju.
Work in all the gold mines operated
by natives has been suspended and
will not be resumed until the recon
struction of the Government is com
pleted.
A- British gunboat has arrived at
Chemulpo with foreign refugees from
Songchin on board.
Responding to the charge of violat
ing the neutrality of Korea, they- point
to the action of Russia in Manchuria,
where thousands of troops were as
sembled long before a diplomatic rup
ture occurred. They say that they are
fully prepared to accept the Judgment
of the world on a comparison of their
course in Korea, where they landed
troops only after a state of war existed
and upon the written permission of tht
Emperor of Korea. They deny that
Chemulpo was a neutral port after the
Japanese landed on February 8, but
whether it was neutral or belligerent,
Russia began hostilities there. When
the Russian gunboat Koreitz steamed
out of the harbor of Chemulpo on the
afternoon of February 8 she opened
fire on the Japanese squadron, making
the. opening shot of the war. The
Japanese guns did not respond, but
the Japanese torpedo-boat destroyers
answered the fire and discharged two
torpedoes before the Koreitz retired.
Japan Is confident of the justice and
strength of its "original position on the
integrity of China and the fairness of
its proposals dyring the negotiations.
It feels fully justified In having com
menced hostilities after breaking off
diplomatic relations and serving no
tice of its intention to take independ
ent action. It is sure that its recent
assurance that it had no intention of
taking possession of Chinese territory
and would guarantee the integrity and
independence of Korea will be* ac
cepted by the powers.
The Emperor of Korea has sent the
Mikado a cordial reply to his personal
message assuring the former that war
with Russia was declared solely with
the view of securing permanent peace
and expressing the sincere wish that
the protocol recently concluded be
tween Japan and Korea will increase
the Intimacy of those countries. The
Korean ruler seems determined to
maintain friendly relations with
Japan.

TOIvl-., .\iairh C>.â An Austrian steam
ship which has arrived at Hakodate
from Vladivostok reports that the Rus
sian squadron left Vladivostok 'on Feb
ruary-29. It is presumed to be cruising
in northern waters with the hope of
capturing Japanese merchantmen. An
other report says that two Russian war
vessels have been seen off Usuri Bay.
Advices from Hakodate do not mention
any attacks on northern ports.
The steamship Ekaterinoslav of the
Russian volunteer transport fleet,
which had been fitted up as an auxili
ary cruiser; the steamship Manchuria,
belonging to the Chinese Eastern Rail
way Company; the schooner Sliepner
and the steam launch Wuliade have
been declared prizes of war by the
naval court as Sasebo. The decision of
the court is subject to an appeal within
thirty days. '
The session of the Diet, opening
March 18, will last only ten days. Dur
ing the session the war credits will be
submitted. Immediately following the
adjournment the Mikado will leave To
kio for Kioto.
The final returns of the parliament
ary elections show that more than 100
new ! members have been elected. The
large increase of the independent mem
bership is regarded as a favorable sign.
Of late years the Diet has largely been
composed of politicians, and popular in
terest and confidence in it have de
creased. The Diet in consequence has
ceased to be the great representative
body the constitution proposed. Political
issues have caused bickering and fre
quent dissolutions, making the Govern
ment partly an oligarchy instead of a
constitutional administration. The war
has revived Interest in national affairs,
and the new Diet is regarded as an im
provement on Its immediate predeces
sors.
Subscriptions to the war bonds,
gifts to the new war fund and con
tributions to war charities have been
exceedingly large. The issue of the
first 100,000,000 yen of war bonds,
which closes on March 10, will be
oversubscribed four times. The Sol
diers' Relief Society, which Is being
promoted by Counts Mat3Ugata and
Inouye, reports subscriptions ap
proaching 1,000,000 yen. Donations
totaling 250,000 yen already have been
paid to the war fund. Hundreds of
applicatiens have been made for per
mission to contribute to the coming
army and navy r - relief funds, the
amounts offered making a total of
250.000 yen.
The Ladies* Patriotic Society, large
ly composed of peeresses and, the
wives of nobles, is raising a fund in
aid of the Red Cross. The latter so
ciety already possesses a large fund
and an extended organization in
Japan.
Japan addressed a note to the pow
ers to-day, in response to the recent
communication from Russia. The
note has not been published here and
its contents are unknown.
Russia's various communications to
the powers attacking Japan for its
conduct of diplomatic negotiations
before their rupture, its attack on
Russia without declaring war and its
alleged violation of the neutrality of
Korea have been received in
largely in the spirit of amusement.
The Japanese resent what is alleged
to be a deliberate attempt to place
them in a false position regarding cer
tain incidents, but in the main do not
take the correspondence seriously.

: It is my experience as a specialist of thirty years. In the book I tell how at
last I found a way to reach difficult, d -ep-seated diseases. Thirty years .of
earnest, ardent toil In hospitals and at bed sides made it possible for me to
write these books. .. X- ;" " ;^v Â¦
The book tells how I perfected my prescription â Dr. Shoop's Restorative.
How. by scientific experiment I traced out the_ causes that bring on chronic
diseases. . . . ' :,-.'.:-. Â¦ ' _ : .
I found invariably that where thers was a weakness, the inside nerves were
weak. Where there was a lack k of vitality, the vital nerves lacked power. Where
weak organs were, found, I always found weak nerves. Xotthe nerves com-*
monly thought of, but the, vital organs' nerves. The Inside â the Invisible
nerves.
.This was a revelation. Then my reil success began. Then I combined In-
gredients that would strengthen/that would vitalize, these nerves.
â¢ That prescription I called a restorative. It is known' the world over now as
Dr. Shoop's Restorative. After that I did not fail to cure one case in each
hundred. In the extremely difficult cases, my failures for ftye years were one
in each forty treated. I found cancer incurable. Cancer Is" for surgery, not
medicine.
Then how, to get this prescription to sick ones everywhere was my thought.
I must announce it in the public press. But. thought I, will they realize the
real truth of my discovery, the real power of .Dr. Shoop's Restorative? Then a
way came to meâ like an inspiration. "I will offer it to the sick on trial. Then
they will know I am sincere â that rav prescription Is unusual." â¢
I wrote a reliable druggist in each city arid village In America. They
agreed to co-operate with me. Now by : any sick, one. Dr. -Shoop's Restorative
can be taken at my risk. For a full month, I will let you use it entirely at my
risk. - ; . ,
-Send no money. Just write me for the book you need. .When I send it I
will tell you of a-druggist near by. who will permit thft^month's trial. Use the
Restorative a month. Then decide. 1 If you say to the druggist, "It did not
help me." that will relieve you of any expense whatever. He will bill the
cost to me. .This is my way. of clearing your mind of all doubt as to what Dr
Shoop's Restorative can do. y ...'..._. r
No matter how prejudiced, you'eannot dispute this absolute security I offer
You'eannot resist an offer like this if - you are at all sick. If you have a weak-

Only one flaw marred the otherwise complete success of this rising statesman.
Catarrh with its insidious approach and tenacious grasp, was his only uncon-
quered foe. For thirty years he waged unsuccessful warfare against this per-
sonal enemy. At last Peruna came to the rescue, and he dictated the following
letter to Dr. Hartman as the result:

SAYS AMERICA OWES
DEBT OF GRATITUDE
PARIS, March 5.â The official view
here does not share that which is said
to prevail at Washington and in Berlin
that the threatening anti-Russian at
titude of the Chinese General3 Ma and
Yuan Shi Kal, the commander-ln-chief,
may lead to a breach of China's neu
trality and compel France to take ac
tion In behalf of Russia. Reports re
ceived here confirm those which have
reached Washington Â£r.d other capitals
âthat the. Chinese troops are showing
much activity ir. Northern China and
along the Manchurian border. They
also indicate that bands of Chinese
brigands are taking advantage of the
opportunity to resume their depreda
tions and raids through . Manchuria:
but the officials here say it is a mistake
to connect such action of . irregular
Chinese forces with the actions of the
Chinese Government. .
The" reports received here show that
irregular actions by various branches
of the Chinese army are likely to bo
unfavorable to Russia and favorabU.

the President's mind as to the desira
bility of granting the sought for per
mission at this time.
However distant the prospect of the
United States becoming embroiled in
the pending war between Japan and
Russia may be regarded, it is certain
that if such a contingency does occur
the War Department will not be found
unprepared. The military forces at all
the posts on the Pacific are oh what
practically amounts to a war footing,
and though nothing beyond common is
noted by a superficial observer, disci
pline is maintained at a rigorous stand
ard and "absence on leave, either for of
ficers or men, is very hard to obtain.
"One never knows what may happen

us should she not now have our sym

.As Americans who love fair play,
is she not entitled to it?
Are we quite sure that, situated as
Russia is in Europe, we can afford to
risk the loss of her friendship?
Ingratitude is not a characteristic
of our people; they may forget. for a

WOMAN* WANTS TO FIGHT..
ST. PETERSBURG. March 5.â In an
swer to a representation made by Em
bassador McCormick in regard to the
American gold miners at Wonsan. Ko
rea, the authorities have assured the
Embassador that the Russian soldiers
will afford them every protection.
The continued dearth of news from
the front does not occasion surprise
here, as the Russians are proceeding
deliberately with their plans, serious
land operations not being expected for
several weeks. However, minor colli
sions in Northern Korea may occur at
any time. . â¢ '
The report of Major General Pflug,
chief of staff of Viceroy Alexieff, that
the stacks of a, Japanese cruiser sunk
near Chemulpo" have been seen confirms
the theory entertained from the first
that the Japanese are following- their
traditional policy of concealing their
losses.
A letter from an officer of the Rus
sian cruiser Pallada has been received
here describing the first attack by the
Japanese upon Port Arthur. The
writer denies the story that the officers
of, trie Russian fleet were ashore and
confirms the statement that the Jap
anese made use of false lights. He as
serts that at 11 o'clock at night' a
practice drill to repel a torpedo at
tack was executed and that toward
midnight four Russian torpedo-boats,
which simulated the enemy, headed
back toward Dalny. from which place
they had come. The crews of the fleet
had retired, only the watch remaining
on deck. The ships were, in the outer
harbor and the captain of the Pal
lada, which vessel occupied the ad
vance position, had descended from
the. bridge for a last look around be
fore going below, when he "perceived
lights advancing. The ship's lights
shown were white above red â -being
those of the Russian warships wheii
they enter the harbor. The captain of
the Pallada supposed, the approaching
vessels were the Russian torpedo-boats
returning from Dalny and his suspi
cion's were aroused only when, upon
drawing nearer, they covered and un
covered their "lights at irregular in
tervals. The signal tower Â¦ signaled
that the lights were not understood.
At this moment the Pallada's cap
tain, through the thick night, made
out the outlines of the torpedo-boat
The weather at Port Arthur during

Many fast locomotives are being

A report that the Egyptian Govern

riously in the newspapers here, _ is
laughed at in official Crcle3. where it
is pointed out that th^. international

a mousetrap to the Japanese, adding
that "not one-hundredth part of the
yellow Napoleons will get out alive."
Embassador McCormick Assured That There Is No
Necessity for the Sending of Marines to
Guard Property at Wonsan.
A terrific explosion occurred under the
hull of thÂ« Pallada, raising a torrent
of water, which submerged the cruis
ers deck, but' did not stop her firing
or maneuvering, which now, however,
were complicated by the measures
taken to close a breach amidships, be
low the water line, made by ,the ex
plosion of the torpedo.
Soon afterward two other torpedoes
exploded almost simultaneously, one
under the bow of the Retvizan and
the other under the stern of the Ce
sarevitch. This double explosion end
ed the attack,' the Japanese vessels
retiring at full speed.
It is possible that the authorities will
arrangp to give Lieutenant Lewton A.
McCuIly. the United States naval at
tache with the Russian navy, special
facilities r over the Siberian Railroad
to join the Russian squadron. He will
come here' immediately from London.
The military attaches will proceed
with similar facilities about April 1.
The Berlin report, based on a tele
gram frum St. Petersburg, that all the
powers except the United States and
Great Britain replied to Russia's note
comjnunicated to her Embassadors
abroad and given out on February 23,
agreein? with the Russian view that
Japan had violated the neutrality of
Korea, is incorrect. The Foreign Of
fice explains that Russia lodged this
protest with the powers without ' re
questing an ansv.-er. leaving them free
to express opinions or not. as they
pleared. At the same time, the pow

.Market and Franklin Streets.Count Alfred Heinrich Carl Ludwig
von Waldersee was born at Potsdam
in 1832. He entered the army in
1S50 and served with distinction
through the war of IS 66 and the

lor. Be this as it may, she certainly
threw herself eagerly into even" move-,
ment that had for Its object the thwart
ing of Bismarck; and she chose out his
bitterest enemies for her special friends.
'A -decree of the Kaiser, however, made
at the instance of the "Iron Chancellor"
forbidding soldiers to meddle in politics,
which every one knew was aimed at
his chief of staff, Von Waldersee, put
a stop to her plans. Officially Count
Waldersae was in disgrace, although
privately he stood as high as ever In
the favor of his. sovereign, who contin
ued then as afterward to give him
proofs of his friendship.
A gc-od proof of tha Emperor's friend
ship was his selection of Von Waldersee
to command the forces of Germany in
China in 1S09, carrying with it perforce
on account of his time of service and
rank the command in chief of the al
lied forces on that occasion. The
Count's camp outfit, uniform, etc, -were
specially designed and provided for
him by the Emperor.
Up to the time of his marriage Count
Waldersee devoted himself entirely to
his military duties. Under the influ
ence of his wife, however, he began
gradually to take an active interest in
politics. Countess Waldersea is one of
the cleverest and most ambitious wo
men in all Europe, and in the early
eighties she was one of the most at
tractive. If rumor is to be relied upon,
no sooner was she married to Count
Waldersee than she made up her mind
that he should be installed in. Prince
Bismarck's place as Imperial Chancel-
forming a circle and taking part in so-;
cifety, notwithstanding that he carried 1
his life in his hands, for he was held in
execration by the Parisians because h^
had been before the war the zealous^
and ever observant agent "of Prince Bis
marck, the favorite, and some saidtbe
confidant and adviser of the credulous
Empress.
Count von Waldersee, though taking
an active part in all the great wars of
his time, never was wounded, never so
much as received a scratch. He had a
strong religious conviction that he was
protected by an especial providence 'or
Hhe benefit of his countryâ indeed, re
ligious feeling which almost bordtred
Â¦ on fanaticism was the keynote of his
character.
Count von. Waldersee, as field mar
shal, was the ranking officer of those
ordered to China I - their Govern
ments upon the outbreak of the Boxer
troubles and upon his arrival on the
scene of action he became commander
in chief of the allied forces. Â¦'
During the occupancy of Peking by
the allied forces- he showed his rare
skill as a diplomatist not only, in deal
ing with the Chinese generals and
statesmen, but also in minimizing the
friction between the military of the
several powers under his command,
whose national jealousies more than
once threatened' to make open rupture.
, A \ tthe \ end of that notable service
Count von Waldersee returned to Ger
many, where he was received by his
august master, the Kaiser, with great
display, and with added honors and
titles went practically into well-earned
rest.. I
The Count was remarkable for. the
ease with which' he worked In harmony
with men holding widely different
views to himself and his tact in dealing
with situations in which different in
terests clashed. After the capitulation
of Paris he, as chief of staff, was ap
pointed to act as. special envoy to ,ar- 1
range the ticklish matter of getting the j
French to pay* the first installment of
the war indemnity,.- and ' . he brought
back .to;Moltke the first check on ac-.
count of the huge war debt.
. After the â¢ war he went to Paris ' as
Charge d' Affaires, and succeeded in
Countess von Waldersee was Miss
Mary Lea, the daughter of a whole
sale grocer of New York. She mar
ried, in 1864, Prince Frederick von
Schleswig - Holstein - Sonderburg -
Augustenburg. Prince Frederick died
six months later, leaving his widow a
fortune of $4,000,000. -She married
Count von Waldersee in 1S66.
SKILLED AS A DIPLO3LVT. ,
Count yon Waldersee originally N en
tered the artillery branch of the ser
vice from the School of Cadets and
rose to the rank of captain as a line
officer. He was then transferred to
the staff of the commanding general,
and as a staff officer he distinguished
himself both by his bravery and his
thorough scientific knowledge of war
fare. *Â¦-_
Waldersee was famed as the cour
tier of the German army. in 1881
General Roberts and several col
leagues from the British army wit
nessed the maneuvers of the Tenth
Army Corps at Hanover, and Count
von Waldersee, as its chief of 'staff, ac
corded them so much hospitable at
tention that they paid him .many com
plime"nts upon their . return to. Eng
land. ..
For more than 200 years the Von
Waldersees have been prominent in
Prussian military affairs. The grand
father of Count von Waldersee was
the author of the standard work on
regulations in the German army, an
abridged copy of which, the "Little
Waldersee," is placed in the hands of
every recruit. A brother of the Count
was killed during the siege of Paris.
Another brother was commander of
the navy. ..
FAMED AS, A COURTIER.
Franco-Prussian war 'of 1870-71. In
1881 he became quartermaster general
and acted" as deputy chief of the gen
eral staff on behalf of the aged Count
von Moltke. When the latter retired
in 18SS Count von Waldersee became
chief of the seneral staff.
lin and Professor Eppstein of Gettin
gen, the great experts in intestinal
maladies, were sent by Emperor "Wil
liam to attend the field marshal.
Von Waldersee was the only sub
ject not of the royal house who was
always cheered by the public. Not
even the Chancellor was treated with
more m respect and admiration, for he
had to do witnTthe things that made
Prussia great and the empire possl
blel His partial estrangement with
the present Emperor in the early part
of the latter's reign, the reason of
which still remains obscure, had long
since disappeared and had been re
placed by the Emperor's cordial
friendship.

YAR1ETY OF TOPICS AT
THE DIFFERENT CHURCHES
Shortly before 8 o'clock the physi
cians informed his wife that medical
skill could do no more. His two neph
ews were also at his side when he died.
Emperor William was at/ once in
formed of the death of the field mar
shal. It is believed that his Majesty
will attend the funeral, which will be
held next Tuesday or Wednesday. The
Emperor was always a great admirer
and firm friend of Count von Walder
see, and when the latter resigned from
the army in 1SSI as a result of the so
called "Von Waldersee crisis," his
Majesty wrote a personal letter refus
ing to accent his resignation and giv
ing the warmest expression to the con
fidence he felt in the Count.
Bismarck in the last year he 'was in
office resented the efforts of the Von
Waldersee group to estrange the Em
peror from him, and secretly in
augurated a newspaper campaign
against the late field marshal. In this
the Count was not mentioned by name,
but was referred to vaguely as "mili
tary undercurrent."
The doctors, Professor Orth of Ber-
HANOVER, Prussia, March 5.â
Field Marshal Count von Waldersee
died shortly after S o'clock this even
ing after a short illness.
Count von Waldersee's end came
without a struggle. The hopelessness
of his case became evident at noon, but
he retained consciousness until 6
o'clock. He was aware of the serious
ness of his condition and asked to see
his friends.

IikxI Eaten Is Worthless Unless Di-
gested â Some Stomachs Must
Have Hell>.
Food taken into the stomach which.
i*om the nature of the food or vhe- con-
dition of the stomach, is not digested
'.verse than no food at all. This is
a true statement as far as it goes, and
a grtiit many dyspeptics go only this
far ivith their reasoning. They ar^ue
with themselves that because their
t-;ti:na<hs do not do the work given
them they must be given less work; in
uiher words, they must be starved. It
v wuld bo just as sensible for a busi-
ness :r.dH who is unable to do all his
u-v.'ii work to cut down his business to
his own capacity as it is for a man
10 starve himself to relieve his stom-
ach. The sensible business man em-
ploys help and coes forward with his
business. Likewise the sensible dys-
peptic will employ^ help for his stom-
ach and give his body proper nourish-
ment.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets actually
do the work assigned to them. They
relieve weak and overburdened stom-
achs of a great portion of digestive
action. Their component parts are
identical with these of the digestive
fluids and secretions of the stomach
and they simply take up the grind and
carry on the work just the same as a
good, strong, healthy stomach would
do it.
On this account Stuart's Dyspepsia
Tablets are perfectly natural in their
action and effects. They do not cause
any unnatural or violent disturbance
in the stomach or bowels. They them-
selves digest the food and supply the
system with all the nourishment con-
tained in what is eaten and carry out
r.ature'e plans for the sustenance and
maintenance of the body.
How much more sensible is this
method than that employed by many
suSerers from weak stomachs. By this
means body and brain get all the good,
nutritious food they need and the man
is properly nourished and equipped to
carry en his work and perform his du-
ties. He could not possibly be in proper
â¢working condition by starving himself
or employing tome new fangled, fn-
suflcient food that does not contain
enough nutriment for a year-old baby.
A strong man doirg strong work must
be properly fed, and this applies to the
brain as well as the body.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets by reliev-
ing the stomach of its work enable it
to recuperate and regain its normal
health and strength. Xature repairs
the worn and wasted tissues just as
she heals and knits the bone of a brok-
en limb, which is of course not used
during the process of repair.
Stuart's Dyspepsia Tablets are for
pale by all druggists at 50 cents a box
and thev are the one article that the
druggist docs r>ot try to- sell something
in the place of that's "just as good."
Their unqualified merit and success and
the universal demand for them has
placed them within the reach of every
one.

have taken no plural wives since the
manifesto of 1890."
Replying to a question from Senator
Overman, Smith said that the pam
phlet containing the manifesto did not
state that it was a revelation from
God, but that the statement was made
that it was published by authority of
the church, which was* sufficient.
It then appeared that the manifesto
had not been put In evidence, and Tay
ler then Introduced It with other docu
ments.
A few minutes before the time for
adjournment arrived a photographer
appeared and was about to focus his
camera upon the committee and Its
distinguished witness, but Senator Dil
lingham made a strenuous objection.
Chairman Burrows stated that no pho
tograph of the committee or of the
room would be taken without the con
sent of the committee. The photo
grapher then folded up his apparatus.
The committee then adjourned until
Monday.

Worthington asked regarding
Smith's son;*^ Hiram. .Smith," and
was told that^e is! 32. years of age and
has a wife and children, but is not a
polygamist. He is one of the twelve
apostles. The first counselor now is
John rt. Winder. He and his fellow
i counselors and other apostles have
been appointed f > since, Smith, be
came president. He said he could not
say whether these men are cohabit-
Jns with more than one wife, but
'"they are reputed to be the husbands
of more than one wife."
In regard to John Henry Smith, a
cousin. Smith said that their fam
ilies arc intimate and "I am strongly
inclined to believe that he is cohabit
ing with plural wives."
SKItMOX OF WOODRUFF.
Referring to Senator Bailey's ques
tions yesterday in regard to the mani
festo, Worthlngton read from a sermon
of President Woodruff, delivered a year
after the manifesto against plural mar
riage, in which President Woodruff de
clared that he was moved, and 10,000
Latter Day Saints were moved, by the
spirit of God to abandon the practice
of plural marriage.
Senator Bailey contended that it was
obedience to the demands of the law
or fear of the consequences of the law
that brought the revelation. Continuing
he said:
"For my part I don't have much faith
in a tioctrlne that does not get a reve
lation commanding the change of con
duct until there is a- statute compelling
It."
"All that, of course, is a matter of
opinion," said Senator Foraker.
"I don't think it is a matter of opin
ion, either." said Senator Bailey. "I
myself have been compelled to submit
to f-ertain rules because it was the law,
and \ f ieious law at that. Just how far I
would have subnjittecV :Jf I had received j
a revelation from Gorf to do something
else I am not prepared to say. I think
the whole thing \vas more a matter of
law lhan of revelation."
"When the laws were passed which
were not in harmony with the teach
ings of our church," said Smith, "we
held that they were unconstitutional.
Of course, our own rules commanded
that we obey the .constitution and the
laws, but we fought the validity of the
new laws from the lowest to the high
est court, and when: it,/ was settled by
the Supreme Cojirt of trie United States
that plural marriages could no longer*
be Indulged In, of course we were In
clined to obey. '
"But we had a revelation on our own
Ftatutr books in regard to plural mar
riages, and It was necessary* to obey
that in order to obtain 'certain blessings
that could not be received without
obeying it. Whether we should obey
the law of the land or continue to prac
tice the law of the church was a serious
question. â¢-â¢â¢.
POCTIUNK OF, REVEriATIOX.
. "We hold that the president of the
church is entitled to receive revela
tions inspired by the Almighty God.
President Woodruff sought guidance
in the Lord and the Lord made It
manifest to him that It waft his duty
to stop plural .marriages. *Hq pro
claimed -that â¢ revelation and- It .was
submitted to the entire church and ac^
cepted by the entire church and thus
became binding and from that day to
this the law of the land has been k^pt

cerned. . \ . .

The reply was: "I am not practicing
polygamy. I am practicing polygamous
cohabitationâ which is not polygamy.
Polygamy is plural marriage, and I
Replying to Chairman Burrows. Mr.
Smith said that he does not teach
polygamj*. and added:
"I am not openly and obnoxiously
practicing polyagmous cohabitation."
"How could you better teach polyg
amy than by practicing it?" Burrows
continued.
DOESN'T TEACH POLYGAMY.
Â¦ In answer to Senator Overman Mr.
Smith said that the revelation of the
manifesto of 1890 had not been pub
lished In the latest edition of doctrine
and covenants, but that, this was an
oversight and would be corrected.
"The rule after all is the law for
conduct." said Senator Bailey. "I was
only trying to emphasize what the
revelations arc. I don't know as much
about the nice distinctions in religion
as I hope I do about the law, but It
appears that both the rule of the
church and the law of the land for
bade polygamous cohabitation, and
you, as the head of the church, vio
lated both."
"I will not quarrel with the Senator
about that;" the witness â¢ replied.
Later he said that Senator Bailey's as
sumption was cordial.

land and the taw of the church aa
laid down In the Woodruff manifesto,
and addressing the witness, he asked:
"Then, as head of the church, are
you violating the laws of the land and
the ordinances ofe your church as
well?"
"Xot the ordinances of the church,"
said Mr. Smith. -
"Well, the law, then ?"
"No; the rule,"said the witness.
would not abandon my children. I
will run my risks before the law."
President Smith's voice sank with
emotion. . He showed more feeling
than he had at any previous time ex
hlbited'as he leaned forward and said:
"But it is to the laws of Utah that I
am answerable; it is the law of my
State that has the right to punish me.
The courts of Utah are of competent
jurisdiction. Congress has no busi
ness to interfere with my private af
fairs.
"If the courts. of my State do~not
see fit to call me to account for my
conduct I cannot help it. Congress
has no right to interfere â It has no
right to pry into my marriage rela
tions and call me to account.'*
-Chairman Bowers at this point ques
tioned the witness. He asked:
"You say you would not abandon
your wives or your children. Why do
you consider It. necessary to have issue
from' your "plural wives, in order to
clothe and care for your children that
had been born' before unlawful co
habitation became a crime?"
"Because my wives are like all other.
women. ' It is* necessary to maintain
peace, harmony and good will between
myself and my good wives. That Is
the kernel in the nut. That. is why I
have chosen not to obey the laws of
my State prohibiting polygamous co
habitation. /
BAILEY QUOTES SCRIPTURE.
"The church gave me my wives, and
I do not think the church could be
consistent in taking them away," said
Mr. Smith in answer to a question as
to why he did not agree to the Wood
ruff manifesto. â¢
â¢ "The Lord giveth and the Lord
taketh away." quoted Senator Bailey
from the Scriptures.
Continuing, the Senator said it ap-
Senator Dubols exercised a right to
question the witness at this point and
gaid the population then, was about
â¢J20.000 and of that number tKcre w*rÂ«
about 50.000 grntiles. He wanted ex
cluded from consideration the number
not in condition to enter a state of
polygamy. HÂ« said President Smith's
utatwmont of the percentage of polyg
amy included suckling bnbes and
children and that he objected to help
ing Smith's statement go before
the country unchallenged.
After a further statement of th<Â»
number of polygamist families In Utah
Smith read from an interview h<Â»
gave to a representative of the Asso
ciated Frew in IS 92, showing the fol
lowing:
"In 1S90. at the time of the latft
President Woodruff's manifesto, there
were 2461 *uch families. In October,
1S39, it was found that this number
had been reduced, as follows: By
deaths. 750; by removals beyond the
confines of the republic, 63; by di
vorce. 95, leaving at that time 1543.
"It is now ascertained that the orig
inal number has been reduced by
1554. or 63 per cent, leaving only S97
DLBOIS MARKS PROTEST.
â¢'As the women vote in Utah," he
?ald. "and as It requires two women
to one man to form polygamy in the
Stat*. probably the number of males
excluded as polygamists would not. be
more than 4000."
Calling President Smith to the stand.
Attorney A. S. Worthlngton resumed
cross-examination for the defense In
the Investigation before the Senate
Committee on Privileges and Elections*
in the case of Reed Smoot of Utah.- He
asked Smith if he had any statistics
showing the proportion of polygamists
In the Mormon population. Smith said
his recollection is that when the Utah
Commission was created, In 1882, and
undertook to administer the laws of
thtf Territory. 12.000 polygamistg were
excluded from voting.
While the witness had been taken in
hand by the defense for purposes of
examination, the members of the com
mittee, Jn reality, -consumed the greater
portion of the time, and matters were
brought out along the line followed
by the prosecution In the three first
days of the hearing. Some of the tes
timony proved highly sensational. The
hearing will be continued at 10:30
o'clock Monday morning.
The witness, angered by the persist
ent efforts of some members of the
committee to obtain from him every
detail of his remission in obeying the
law, turned on Congress and charged
that body with Interfering, without au
thority, in his private domestic affairs
and usurping the powers of the Utah
courts, tvhleh alone, he said, possessed
the right to hold him to account for
his conduct.
WASHINGTON. March 5. â Admis
sions drawn from Joseph F. Smith,
president of the Mormon church, re
specting his continued violations of the
law forbidding polygamous cohabita
tion again constituted the feature of
the proceedings to-day before the Sen
ate Committee on Privileges and Elec
tions against Senator Reed Smoot of
Utah.

knowlfrdÂ£e of this priceless boon, and 'â¢
â¢ven to the uttermost ends of the earth I
I eecd my menace of love and peace '
and hope and help. Unbelievers may i
ecoff and cry "fake." but I heed them i
cot. My work has Just begun and I am j
savin r men.
The secret of this mighty heallnt; j
power, this vital life rpark. this mar- !
?Â»lous toalc ftuM Is known to me alone, j
"Jf o KÂ»r. Za I.crt â TaÂ«r* Za a Sara Oar* j
fcr rvtry Weak Moa." â Sr. Tcrris.
It is miv to jrlve to whom I will and :
my T-orks go before me. Doubt not! |
I ask r.o man to believe mÂ«, but I jive
to even' weak man firÂ« this prlcelÂ»rs '
boon and It restores him Instantly to j
the strength and powerful vigor of |
youth. With this marvelous, mysterious
compourd. which I have 4 ls covered j
only after a lifetime devoted to search
through ali the realms of science, and ;
the archives cf the ancients, It Is powi- :
ble for every weak man to have for his
e*n the giorious manly power, thÂ« un-
Urtag vigor and the long life of the
patriarchs of Bible times. With this
mysterious compound no weak man
rrill Â«?ver again be troubled wfth Impo-
t^nry. \ital losses, nightly emissions,
eperrr.atorrhea, varlcocele, prematur-
Ity, defective power or lack of vital
enerfy.
Send me no money. It Is my duty,
â¢raided by an Unseen Hand â !t Is my
tniEEion on earth â my life work â to lift
Â«r *he fallen, heal the weak and eurÂ«
the maimed or undeveloped; and to ev-
ery mar. who has lost his vital power
cr f.r.ds it -vanlng. I Bend my message
cf love ar.<J peace and health. I can
save him and I will save him and re-
nter* h!m to mary years of happiness
and the lmDetuous vitality and vigor-
ous manhood of perfect health and
youth.
Remember. It matters not how old
ycu are; It matters not how you lost
your manhood, or when you loit It. It
rr.attcr? r.ot what doctors or ecoffera
say. This is no ordinary drug or stlm-
u'atinr method of treatment, but It is
the vital srark of life itself, and it
matters rot how many remedies and
doctors have failed. I have repeatedly
and Instantly renewed the youth of old
men. My secret compound never fails.
I have often Instilled into jaded men
new vitality, health and strength. Tor
worn-out men I have oft kindled, in an
Instant, and to itay, the sparkling vi-
tality of youth. Write to me to-day
and tell me !n strictest confidence all
about your case. My private addr-cs
is Dr. C. Sargent Ferris, 368 Strain
building. Cleveland, Ohio, and I urge
every weak man to come to me, for I
will give him undying strength, the su-
preme Joy and happiness of perfect
manliness. My wendrous discovery haÂ»
startled the world by Us miraculous ef-
fects, yet I s**k not fame nor glory. It
suffices me if I may be the humble in-
strument of Natare's greatest power la
bringing all men Into the enjoyment of
their true manliness and I do It frse.
In the time allotted to me here en
earth I shall do all that in my power
lies to give my fellow men the benefit of
this great secret and my reward shall
be in the knowledge that I have done
unto others as I would that others
sbould do unto me.

pean Countries Must Lead to
Trouble.
LONDON. March 5.â The expansion
of European countries is drifting to
ward Palestine, and it is there that the
final clash of interests will occur.
Such at least is the opinion of Dr. M.
Gaster. who read a paper on "The Po
litical Aspect of the Future of Pales
tine" to a gathering of the Central
Asiatic Society yesterday.
Austria, he said, was gradually creep
ing down the Novi-Bazar, and was
building railways to connect with Sa-
Jor.ica; while Russia would never give
vp her dream of occupying Constanti
nople as a ctepping-stone to India.
Dr. Gaster foresaw a possible solution
of the difficulty in the Zionist move
meet. If the Jews colonized Palestine
they would make of it a strong buffer
nation, and would show favor to none.
And seme women marry just to
show the other drl.

Admiral Close, who took part in the
discussion following the lecture, which
â¢was entitled "Coast Defense From the
Imperial Standpoint." said he was as
tonished at the want of proper defenses
In the Thames fortifications.
"If Germany declared war on Mon
day," he said, "they could have a
couple of gunboats up the river to the
middle of London the next night."
"London," he added, "will never be
eafe until they have a couple of such
craft stationed in the river. A gunboat
could get pact Sneerness. and there
would be nothing to stop it except a
few police boats. Invading vessels
could Inflict any amount of damage.
Thty would* destroy the houses of parli
ament, the tower, and play havoc with
the chipping. V-" ::'Â¦.Â» -
"The danger was not realized by the
public," said the admiral, "and until it
was London would never be safe."
Such is the picture which has been
painted in lurid colors as the outcome
of a recent lecture at the United Ser
vice Institution.
LONDON. March 5.â London, at the
mercy of German gunboats, the coast
cf the metropolis shelled from the lower
Thames, her shipping destroyed, her
public buildings reduced to ruins and
the British empire thus struck that
"terrible blow over the heart" against
â¢which the late Lord Salisbury warned
his countrymen in one of his last
speeches. ,

HONOLULU. Feb. 25. â In answer
to a cabled inquiry to Governor Car

There are not enough American ves

The local realty conditions are con
tinuing to be favorable. Large leases
are made, good -sized properties are
changing hands and there is a lively
market for small properties in nearly
all parts of the city. The Real Estate
Circular, published by Thomas Magee
& Sons, trtimales the sales of February
at 53.T5j.SHG in amount and 5S6 In num
ber. Where the bulk of the business is
being done is revealed by a tabulation
is the Circular, which shows that out
of :>S6 February pales 167 were in the
MiEsior.. 143 in the Western Addition
and 15'J in outside lands and home
steads. A large share of the amount
credited to the outside lands and home
steads is due to the activity' in Rich
irond and Sunset districts.
It may be. surprising to learn that the
value in sales in the outside lands for
February was greater than the value in
pales in the Mission. The outside lands
had to their credit sales representing a
value of J420.8S0; Mission, $279,705;
Western Addition, $940,335. The prepon
derance in values in the Western Addi
tion is due to the higher prices per
front foot, but it will be observed that
there were more sales in the outside
lands than there were in the Western
Addition.
Concerning the general situation the
Heal Estate Circular says:
Sale* of real estate recorded in the month of
JVbruary were 566 in number and amounted to
s:!.75j.I>&6. Tills is an increase over the busi
ness of January, which is largely accounted
(or by the recording of the deed to H. E. Law
on his Jl, 000. COO purchase on Market street,
oppofcite Kearny.
An increase in the number of transfers for
the month Is noted. The sales in the 50-vara
section continue to fall off in number and
nmount. The siles in the 100-vara section
were this month very high, for the reason
above riven, but aside from this sale the fig
ures for this section have not been up to the
iriark for se\eral months. The Western Addi
tion and Mission hold their own very well,
trhile it is noticeable that the sales in the out
>-;<5o lar.d section are higher than for any time
ftr many years. This fact. In connection
with the lewer flirurcs in other sections, indi
cate* quite plainly that the email buyer Is In
i he rr.Mket. The outer portions of the 'West
ern AflcJition and the better portions of the
outside lands are In demand. While these
Tiurchases are made for homes, there will be
little danger of speculation. We hope exten
tivc buying and selling of vacant land in
These E'cticns on speculation on one-third and
one-half cash will not eccur, as the market
will eventually be harmed by euch epecula
ticn.

about 3 o'clock in the afternoon re
turned to his home, at 469 Stevenson
street. His wife heard him come in,
but did not see him. Quinn, guided by
his pilot, went to his bed and lay down.
When his wife called him at 5:45 o'clock
he did not respond to her summons.
Examination showed that he was dead.
Alcoholism is supposed to have been
the cause. The blind man was a heavy
drinker, his wife states, and often com
plained of his heart.
Quinn and his dog were well known
to the travelers on the city's principal
thoroughfares. The blind man sold
pencils for a living and was led about
each day by his dog. People on the
streets often stopped and watched with
a feeling of love the little red dog clad
in a- red blanket guiding his master by
means of a string attached to its collar
carefully across dangerous street cross
ings, in, and out of the maze of pedes
trians. Whenever the dog would reach
an obstruction he would stop, and then
his master would know that he would
have to wait until his guide saw the
v.ay clear. After a particularly hard
day's walking the two could often be
seen resting on their way homeward.
Quinn made a good living and had a
good wife at home, who cared for him
better than most blind men are cared
for. He was a soldier in the Civil War
and later served in several hot engage
ments with the Indians on the frontiers
of Arizona' and other Western States.
While in Arizona he was shot and lost
the sight of both: eyes. He had been,
blind tor twelve years. ~7 :V .'*
that the one who for years he had
lÂ»iloted in and out through the throngs
on the crowded thoroughfares had at
last gone to his Maker. When the Cor
oner took the body, after-having enticed
the diminutive animal from his owner's
head, the little fellow sat up a pitiful
howl, as if grieving at being taken
from his only friend.
F. Dilpiana, alias Frank Defeserc,
was arrested last night by officers T. J.
I^avanaugh and J. C. Stenzler and
charged with an assault with a deadly
weapon. Defesere cot into an alter
cation with a fisherman named Raffaei
Dltule of 424. Broadway, and Ditule al-'
leges that Defesere took a shot at him.
Was Bent on Murder.
The little dog didn't know that its
master was dead. To him the eyes that
were always closed now appeared the
same. There was nothing to tell him
The blind man with the little red dog
and blanket, so familiar to pedestrians
alcing Market street, is dead. John
Franci3 Quinn was the blind man's
name. Sitting on the bed beside its
dead master, keeping guard, the little
red dog, clad in his red blanket, snarled
and fought at Deputy Coroner McCor
mlck when he went to remove the
corpse yesterday afternoon.

P. J. Ebener, driver of a bakery

A woman who gave her name as
Eliza Vanteight, was. found wandering
about *on the beach near the life
saving station at 2 o'clock yesterday
morning. She is about 80 years of age
and said she lived at 550 Olive avenue,
but could give no reason for being on
the beach at that hour. She was taken
to the Park Emergency Hospital, where
she received treatment. The woman's
ololhinff was drenched. This is not the
first time she has wandered about, and
her relatives say she is demented. .
Found Wandering 5 on Beach.
The contour of the rock will have, to
be reduced by dynamite and the foun
dation of the huge concrete structure
laid under great physical disad
vantages. It will probably be two years
before'the foremost lighthouse on the
Pacific Coast will be completed.
Navigators frequenting the Oakland
estuary, especially in foggy weather,
have complained to the United States
Lighthouse Department of the contract
ed radius of the sound proceeding from
the bell located in the tower at the en
trance. '* Upon the recommendation of
Colonel Handbury a new. apparatus has
been installed, by which the 4000
pound bell will be more vigor
ously struck and a sound emit
ted that will be clearly audi
ble throughout the distance from
the west to the east side of the bay.
The new "hammer" weighs at least
fotry, pounds and will have a striking
force far in excess of the old one. By
automatic pdwer, the , Btroke ; will , tje
made once in every five seconds.
DISADVANTAGES GREAT.
The situation of Mile Rock is regard
ed as difficult by experts. Its summit
must be leveled in order that the su
perstructure above it may be properly
anchored. As an engineering problem
the difficulties to be surmounted are
only less than those .which were in
volved in the construction of the
famous Tillamook light. The interrup
tions which are anticipated from the
storms from the northwest, southwest
and west leave less than 100 favorable
days for construction. Necessarily the
erection of the Mile Rock lighthouse
will be slow.
The light will be of the first order,
and besides a siren will have a bell,
whose warning will sound far over the
sea. An engine of adequate power will
provide the steam necessary to operate
the siren. The lighthouse will be de
pendent upon the mainland for water,
which Is to be provided by auxiliary
steamers landing upon the lower rock,
thence pumped into tanks located in
the superstructure of the main light
house.
The lighthouse which Colonel Hand
bury, chief of the department, recom
mends will be 100 feet In height and
constructed of concrete. The radius of
its light will extend as far as the Faral
loncs.
FIRST ORDER LIGHT.
Specifications for the great Mile Rock
lighthouse have at last been completed j
and transmitted to the department at
Washington for approval. It is antici
pated that early advertisement will be
made calling for bids for its construe-'
tion.
This improvement is one that promi
nent marine interests of the coast have
long advised. The rock lies at the en
trance of the bay, about a mile north
of Point Lobos, and is supposed to be
the spot where the Rio de Janeiro
struck three years ago.
Mile Rock reaHy consists of two. one
of which rises about twenty feet above
mean water, while the other is barely
visible. Together they constitute a first
class menace to navigation, as the tides
and currents of the bay drive vessels
entering the harbor directly toward
them.

menced on Proposed New

Another lot of residence sites south

is being offered in subdivisions and on
terms to suit by Baldwin & Howell,
who are the sole agents for the tract
in question. which includes the
frontages on Twcnty-flrst avenue and
H and I streets. â¢ The avenue is now
on official grade, is macadamized and
sewered and the lots fronting thereon
are level and ready to build on. The
vi?ws are most attractive, owing to its
high elevation and the proximity of
Golden Gate Park and Strawberry
Hill. To the west of thi3 property
bunch grass has been planted, thus
securing sands from drifting. Addi
tional Welsbach street lamps have
been ordered placed along Twenty

great advantage to this immediate
neighborhood Is the .Improved car
service on H street, as cars are run

At the session of the Fire Commis
sioners yesterday, Lieutenant William
Gill of Engine Company No. 10 was
fined ?100 for disrespect and insubordi
nation. Gill took umbrage at the pun
ishment meted out to him on a former
occasion for assaulting his captain.
Thinking that Commissioner, Barrett
was rather severe on him at that time,
he went to Mr. Barrett's private office
and sought to interview him and, when
an audience was refused, he became
abusive. He appeared before the board
yesterday and apologized, which, no
doubt, saved him from dismissal, as
Commissioner Parry was disposed to
drop him from the role. Lieutenant
Thomas H. Dowd of Engine Company
No. S was fined twenty days* pay for
insubordination and disobedience to his
captain. The light sentence was due
to his being off duty at the time.
Insubordinate Firemen Fined.
Mo!c"s for making half-dollar" pieces
and 150 of the Coins were" found on Win
kelmann's person when he was arrested.
At the time of his arrest by United
States Secret Service Agent George W.
Hazen he was employed by Sylvain
Schnaittacher, who looked upon him
as a most pious and exemplary young
man. His opinion changed, however,
when Agent Hasen handed him half a
dozen bank checks bearing Mr. Schnait
tacher's signature, which young Win
kelmann had been using as copies from
which to practice the Schnaittacher
signature. ~ ; i â¢
Winkelmann arrived in Mexico from
Germany about three years ago with
$2500 in his possession, which he pro
ceeded to spend with the recklessness
of a man-of-war's man. He came to
this city shortly after with $500 remain
ing, and being a clever draughtsman
had no difficulty in obtaining employ
ment with architects.
Andreas "Winkelmann, a youth of 22
summers with a hitherto unblemished
reputation and up to the time of his ar
rest an esteemed member of the Young
Men's Christian Association, stood up
crestfallen before United States District
Judge de Haven yesterday and received
sentence on his plea of guilty of coun

was that he be imprisoned in the State

months and pay a fine of $100.

A DR'S. FOOD ,
Found a Food Tlmt Lifted Him Out of
. The food experience of a doctor ex-
perimenting with himself is worth
knowing. He says:
"I had acid dyspepsia since I have
any knowledge, from eight years old
I know.
"It worked down from stomach to
intestines, locating at the umbilicus
in enteritis; until six years ago the
agony every few days was, something
terrible. I have walked the floor for
hours unable to eat or' digest if I
should eat.
"Medicine would not relieve me at
all. Four years ago I began the use
of Grape-Nuts and since the first dish
I have never had an attack of the old
trouble. I take four tablespoonfula
once a day with my supper, which is
composed only of whole wheat bread
and the Grape-Nuts.
; V'The wonderful part of my : case is
that I have never, had an. attack of
even any of the -. dreadful; symptoms <
since the: very first meal of
Nuts. Most. of ray patients know how
suddenly and : promptly Grape-Nuts
cured me,' and I have 'prescribed the
food with srood -.results in many cases."
Name given ,by Postum Co., Battle
Creek/ Mich.'/
Grape-Nuts is regularly prescribed
â¢in' place -of â¢ medicine by many physi-
cians for stomach or. intestinal trouble^
lack of nourishment, brain fag and 1
nervous prostration.- The^ result usu-
ally shows immediate improvement
and a speedy complete cure*.
Ten days' trial' "of r Grape-Nuts in
place of starchy foods works wonders.

WASHINGTON, March 5. â Repre
sentative James Sherman of New
York, chairman of the Indian Affairs
Committee of the House of Repre
sentatives, had a conference to-day
With the President regarding the^bill
providing' for the opening to settle
ment of 416,000 acres of land in the
Rosebud Reservation, S^uth Dakota.
By the , terms of the measure the land
may be sold to settlers for not less
than $3 an acre, the amount of the
purchase price to be paid in five an
nual installments, the land not sold
under the first? offer to be allotted at
$4 an acre. President Roosevelt in
formed Sherman that he was unalter
ably opposed to the terms of payment
fixed' in J^he bill as it passed the House.
In.fact'his opposition to the'price of
the land as specified in the House bill
is so strong, that if the measure were
passed by Congress in that shape he
would veto it. It -Has been shown by
excellent authorities that the land is
worth an average price of at least $6
an acre, at the lowest, and some of it
is worth as much, as $25 an acre.

of last year and judgment was given
for the defendant. Martinelli, accord
ing to the decision, was to retain pos
session of the premises in dispute until
October 1, 1904. The property Involved
is the old Smith Brown place of about
500 acres adjoining the lands of the
Napa State Hospital on the south. The
plaintiff had been allowed sixty days
in which to appeal to the Supreme

PORT COSTA, March 5.â The Coro

Engineers L. L.. Baker and James P.
Bennett, who were killed in the col
lision at Luzon static-n, on the Santa
Fe route, on February 27, brought in
a verdict that the wreck was caused by
the carelessness of A. W. Taylor, a
porter-brakeman, who threw the swifch
that turned the limited train on , the
siding on which the overland express
was standing. The jury exonerated Tay
lor from any criminal intent, however,
and he was discharged from custody.
He had been held here in jail since
the accident. The jury recommended
that nc/ porter be allowed to perform

The report then states that the in
vestigation was confined largely to
one division, and it is impossible to say
whether or not the same corrupt meth
ods obtain in other divisions. The busi
ness intercourse between the divisions
make such a condition possible, it
says, and some system of checks is
recommended so that frauds could not
easily be achieved. The minority re>
port concludes on this subject: /
"In view of the interesting report
mentioned and of the hearings-end of
the detailed proof furnished by the de
partment to the committee of the im
proper conduct of posto/Rce officials
and of the charges against other di
visions of the department and the im
perfect methods of obtaining facts as
to the conduct of affairs in that office,
it would be the part of wisdom that the
House should proceed to a full and
complete investigation of the Post
offlce Department in all of its branches
for the betterment of -the service, the
prevention of frauds and the general
protection of the public interest."
WASHINGTON^ March 5.â The re
port on the postofflce appropriation

of the minority, signed by Representa

of his owr\ condemning railway mail

for the lease for fifty years of the post

In the minority report proper an in
vestigation of ' tl^e Postofflce Depart

Bristow investigation are made a part
of the report, "which is declared to be
a disclosure of "startling corruption
in the division investigated and a
method of doing business naturally
conducive to fraud."

NEW YORK,- March 5.â Stating that
he was suffering from a fever, cold and
sore throat, Governor B. Odell to
day abandoned -his proposed trip to
Washington to consult with President
Roosevelt, and returned to Albany, at
the same time positively putting him
self out of line for the chairmanship of
the National Republican Committee.
â¢"Nothing has been settled yet," the
Governor said as to his acceptance of
the State chairmanship, "and this mat
ter is still under consideration."
In mentioning the permanent aban
donment for the present of the Wash
ington trip Governor Odell also made
an emphatic declaration on. the subject
of his leadership ln this State, stating
that "there is nothing in the affairs of
the party in this State that I cannot
settle myself without assistance if I
wish, and the President isn't apt to call
on me to settle the affairs Â«f the na
tion. I shall not go to Washington for
some time, as I have several engage
ments up the State, and there is noth
ing I wish to see ttie President about
that is urgent or that will not keep." ,
"Will you accept the national chair
manship?" he was asked. ,
"No, I never had any such idea," he
replied. "It is not the kind of work I
am looking for, and I would not ac
cept it if it were offered to me on a
silver platter."
WASHINGTON, March 6.â President
Roosevelt received a telephone message
from Governor Odell last night inform
ing him that he had been attacked by a
severe cold. This morning the. Presi
dent received a telegram from the Gov
ernor saying that he would be obliged
to return immediately to Albany, as
his physicians had informed him that
he had an attack of the grip. He stated
therefore that he would be unable to
keep his engagement with the Presi
dent to-day. President Roosevelt wrote
the Governor, expressing regret that
he would be unable to come to Wash
ington at this time, and telling him he
would be glad to see him at any time
in the near future.
It can be authoritatively stated that
Governor Odell has not been offered the
chairmanship of the Republican Na
tional Committee, and that there is no
probability, that, he will/ be, offered the
position. It was none, of the; objects of
Governor Odell's visit to Washington
to discuss the: national chairmanship
with the President so far as the accept
ance of the place by' the Governor was
concerned. " It :1s^understood (that Gov
ernor Odell's visit is merely postponed.

TRUSTEES LET CONTRACT
FOR REPAIRING A LEVEE
Some discrepancy between the esti
mates and the officially reported in
crfaLfc was looked for, but bo great a
difference as that shown was somewhat
surprising. It may have been due, how
ever, to movements incident to prepa
rations for compliance with the treas
ury call for the surrender of public de
posits, or, what| seems to be more rea
sonable, to the decrease in circulation,
to remittances for the retirement of
bank notes for the account of corre
spondents and to withdrawals of $1,250,
000 gold for shipment to Buenos Ayres.
If the latter was one of the causes the
amount withdrawn would count for but
one day* in the averages.
The deposits were increased by $12,
673,400. which is greater by $2,007,600
than the sum of the net gain In cash
and of the increase in loans, therefore
the statement does not balance. The
increase In required reserves due to the
augmented deposits was $3,168,350. De
ducting therefrom the net gain in cash
leaves $2,206,550 as the reduction in sur
plus "reserve ' to $29,943,350. Computed
upon the basis of deposits, less those of
$39,137,200 public funds, the surplus is
$39,727,650.
The Government deposits were in
creased by $375,300, making the gain
since February 6 $2,243,900. The circula
tion was decreased $1,049,800, and the
reduction in this item since the begin
ning of the year has been $5,755,900.
Loans expanded by $9,709,300, probably
reflecting the hypothecation, of sterling
exchange, which has been bought for
investment,' and also some special syn
dicate or corporation borrowings, i
NEW YORK, March 5.â The Finan
cier says: The most notable feature of
the official statement of the New York
AFbcciatcd Banks were the new hS?h
recjids to<~ loans, specie, cash-rejexve
and deimlts.. The net increase in the
cash rt serve was $961,500, or $2,041.<'>00
less than the amount of gain which
was estimated on the basis of the trace
able movements of money during- the
week.
NEW YORK, March 5.â The stock
market came under the influence of an
expected Northern Securities decision
on Monday and lost more of the small
gains which had been established by
the slow and laborious hardening move
ment Of the whole of the week up to
to-day. The market closed easy and at
declines running to a point in a number
of the prominent stocks.
The volume of liquidation was unim
portant and indicated nothing more
than traders' positions in the market,
but the impelling motive was clear
enough and was corroborated by the
weakness of Northern Securities itself
on the curb. The bank statement was
without any influence. The increase in
cash wa5 slightly less than expected,
but the fact that there was an increase
at all Is evidence of the continued ten
dency toward congestion of reserves.
The loan expansion was viewed with
equanimity in view of the condition of
the reserves, notwithstanding that the
loan item establishes a new high rec
ord again, with an . aggregate, for the
clearing-house banks within $82,000 of a
round $1,000,000,000. # ThIs is supposed to
reflect renewed corporation borrowing,
including the $3,000,000 taken by the
New York Central and the same amount
by the Burlington. The fact that the
latter was placed in Chicago would not
prevent its reflection in the New York
Bhowing.
Railroads reporting gross earnings
for the fourth" week in February show
some increases over the similar period
of last year,' but the additional day in
February of this year, which figures in
the showing, distorts the comparison.
Foreign influences were against the
market, London being confronted with
a mining settlement next week, just
after emerging from the strain of the
Paris settlement this week. Consols as
a cqnsecuence touched a new low rec
ord in. London to-day, for the move
ment. Total sales of bonds $940,000.
The deadlock in the security market
has been unrelieved this week. Buyers
and sellers desist from activity, and
the result is nn almost motionless mar
ket, which' is the despair of the trading
element and also of the brokerage ele
ment, which looks to commissions for
its business profits. '
, The jnarket is hard and free from
.pressure.' but the maintenance of prices
fails to invite any absorption of stocks.
The behavior of individual stocks un
der an occasional attempt to liquidate
a small amount occasions a dread that
the^ firmness, is partly^ illusory. The
lethargy is the more notable In view
of the | accumulation of reserves in the
banks and .the;nominal rates at which
call money is loaned.

WASHINGTON, March 5. â The
House to-day passed the Indian appro

relative to some provisions affecting
tribes in the Indian Territory. An un
successful effort was made by Stephens
of Texas to eliminate the provision for
continuing the Dawes commission an
other year.
An amendment by Little of Arkan
sas was adopted removing the re
strictions'on the sale or lease of lands
of all allotments of the five civilized
tribes of the Indian Territory who
are not of Indian blood except the re
strictions on the homestead. Another
amendment by Little was adopted,
which places with the Secretary of the
Interior the authority heretofore vest
ed in the Dawes commission to sell at
public sale tracts from the residue of
land belonging to the Creeks in the
Creek Nation, now unsettled and con
sisting of about 5000 acres.

quoted as saying in the corridor that
hÂ«Â» did not wish by his presence to
"â¢onflrm the eulogy pronounced upon
his former client's heart and char
acter.
Following II. Mornard's address the
< ourt retired, remained closeted for an
hour and then returned and gave out
the decision sustaining the appeal for
a revision of the trial and ordering a
rupplementary investigation. This de
cision from the highest tribunal in
France goes a long way toward the
complete rehabilitation of Dreyfus, the
subsequent steps being generally re
garded as formalities for carrying out
this favorable attitude of the court-
The court held that a sufficient
showing had been made to warrant a
reopening of the case and ordered a
fupplement&ry investigation for the
purpose of establishing all the doubt
ful points -which have been the bails
for the present application to reopen
the case. ThÂ« decision Is another
marked success for Dreyfus, although
it Is not yet final, owing to the ex
tended supplementary Investigation
which must follow the court's deci
sion.
The decision was given at the close
of the third day's hearing. Compara
tively little public interest has been
taken In the sessions of the court and
the courtroom was almost deserted,
there being less than fifty persons
present at the final session. Among
those were Maltre Laborle. the famous
lawyer, who defended Dreyfus at
Rennes.
PARIS, March 5.â The criminal
branch of the Court of Cassation to
<3ya granted the appeal of Alfred
Dreyfus for a revision of his trial at
Kennes.

THE VAXiUE OP CHARCOAIi.
lew People Know How Useful U Is
In Preserving Health and Beaut j.
Nearly everybody knows that char-
coal is the safest and most efficient
disinfectant and purifier in nature, but
lew realize Its value when taken into
the human system for the same
cleansing purpose.
Charcoal is a remedy ths.t the more
you take of It the better; it is not a
drug at all, bst simply absorbs the
gases and impurities always present in
the fctnmach and intestines and carries
tn-m out of the systin-..
Charcoal sweetens the breath after
tr.iukfng, drinking or after eating
oiiions and other odorous vegetables.
Charcoal effectually clears and im-
proves the complexion; it whitens the
teeth and further acts as a natural
and eminently rife cathartic
It absorbs.the injurious gases which
collect in the stomach and bowels; lt
disinfects the mouth and throat from
the poison of catarrh.
Aii druggists sell charcoal in one
form or another, but probably the
best charcoal and the most for the
money is in Stuart's Absorbent Loz-
enges; they are composed ot the finest
powdered willow charcoal and other
harmless antiseptics in tablet form or
rather in the form of large, pleasant
tiisthsg lozenges, the charcoal being
mixed with honey.
Th* daily use of these lozenges will
soon tell iu a much improved condi-
tion of the general health, better com-
liicxion, sweeter breath and purer
bluod, und the beauty of it is that no
pu^iible harm can result from their
continued .use, but, on the contrary,
Srreut benefit.
A Buffalo physician in speaking of
the benefits of charcoal says: "I ad-
\ :se Stuart's Absorbent Lozenges to
all patients suffering from gas in
Flomach and bowels and to clear the
complexion and purify the breath,
mouth ;:nd throat; I also believe the
Iiv?r is greatly benefited 1 7 the daily
use of them: they tost but 25 cents a
bos at drug stores, and although Jn
t-ome sense a patent preparation, yet
1 believe I set more and better char-
coal :it Stuart's Absorbent Lozenges 1
than in any of the ordinary charcoal!

What changes have taken place in
the history of Japan during the past
half century its present position testi
fies to in a thousand ways." It seems
incredible that only as recently as 1853
Christians were forbidden to* set foot
on Japanese soil under penalty ''of
death, yet such was the case.' One
edict, inscribed on tablets of:" wood and
stone. as\the "Tokio Sun Trade Jour

sun shall warm the earth let no Chris

In the old days, when the torchlight

and the sizzling rocket contributed to
the gayety of politics, lere. existed dur
ing one Presidential campaign a band
cr stalwarts known as the Hancock
Guards of Oakland. The war horses
of Democracy across the, bay were
members of this old-line and old-time
marching club.
Their leader was one Captain Pat
O'Kane, as faithful a Democrat as ever
cast a ballot, and possessed of a sturdy
figure that loomed up grandly in the
red-shirted uniform of the Hancock
Guards, One night, a memorable one,
the j Guards 200 strong, came to San
Francisco to march in a grand Demo

at their head, strong In party fealty
but a bit. shy in military tactics. He
got his men together at the ferry land

up Market street for the place of ren

The first Japanese leader, in point of
service, is Field Marshal Yamagata,
the highest military authority in the
empire. He is over 65 years of age,
a veteran of many wars, having begun
service in the struggle which restored
the Emperor's power in 1868. In 1872,
he was Assistant Secretary of War, the
next year a lieutenant general, and, in
1S75, Secretary of War. As chief .of
the royal staff in the rebellion of 1876 he
was the real general in chief who led
the imperial forces to \-Ictory. As a
reward -he was *>-omoted to the full
rank of general. He has been three
times Prime Minister, and has also
held various other positions in the
Cabinet. In 1894 he commanded the
first army that invaded Manchuria
against the Chinese. After the war he
was made marquis and field marshal.
After Japan had been deprived of the
fruits of her victory by the action of
Russia, France and Germany, Yama
gata was appointed special Embassa
dor to St. Petersburg to negotiate for
the preservation of the independence of
Korea. There he effected the treaty
which is the basis of Japan's latest de
mands upon Russia. Considering his
age and health, it Is improbable that he
will take the ' A& in the present cam
paign against the Fussia^.s, but will act

charge of the Tularc Judge.- Â¦ Â¦ -. " . .
' The Folsom convicts" who killed' the .guards while
escaping from prison set up the plea of self-defense.
It is easy ,to, see that all such characters. .would readily,
from their moral standpoint and their view., of; the law,
act upon the theory that, they .were- justified in killing
officers to' avoid arrest. * Perhaps ; the beneficiary of '.his
Judge's charge is an estimable citizen, who deserved
to be. acquitted,, but -he lost a fiuc, opportunity to teach
the- community a lesson when' he failed 'Â¦Â¦ to carry his
rights into court, instead of shedding blood in their
vindication. ,: ' ! . . ' y
, Ah "arresting officer is liable to be mistaken in taking
a supposed 'offender into custody, but he is not thereby
guilty of ; a capital crime justifying the. arrested party in
summarily executing him. The proper course under
such circumstances is not left out of the' law. An arrest
precedes ah* appearance before a court, where -the mis
take is corrigible and its victim. has recourse in a civil
action against, the officer, if the circumstances warrant it.
Onc ( man is legally justified in killing another only when
his own life is 'in jeopardy. '., If the Judge had charged
the jury 1 . that the homicide was .justified if the .officer
were menacing the other man's life and caused him, to
think he was in imminent peril, he. would have been
more -nearly within the law. :
Chris Evans was a <ytizen of- Tularc County *and is on
record to the . effect that he -did not. .believe he was
guilty of any crime in robbing, trains, since he was only
avenging upon corporations the , wrongs they; had. done
to the people whose champion he was. He has declared
that if he made a mistake it was; an error of the head
and not of the heart," a mere mistake in judgment. V As
he made himself the judge of whether he had committed
an offense, justifying arrest, Kis subsequent i career, in
which we. believe he materially reduced the peace estab
lishment of several counties,' seems to.be in line with the
IN charging a jury in a 'murder case in Tulare County
â¢ â¢ the Judge saidj "Where no offense has been com
mitted by aT* person,, nor in the presence of the
arresting officer, such person has a right to resist the
arrest and may use all necessary means to; regain his
liberty." . *"'"â¢.Â¦ - â¢ ;
Begging pardon ' for differing, we must insist that
killing the arresting officer is not the use of proper
means. This seems to have! been the. point, at. issue. The
accused had. killed â¢ an' officer who had Â¦ arrested him,
and we suppose was acquitted under the -Judge's charge
to "the" jury. - If that charge is to be taken as law, then
every person who is arrested is made the judge of
whether ..he' has 'or has not J committed an offense to
justify, taking him into custody. Under such circum
stances peace officers would better increase their life
insurance and wear armor.
RESISTING OFFICERS.
As a result of recent agitation over
the communicability of disease by shell
fish taken from waters polluted by sew
age, there have been numerous Investi
gations of the subject by biologists In
Europe and the United States. The last
report of the British Royal Commis
sion on Sewage Disposal considers in
derail the progress made in recent in
vestigations, and states that there is
no doubt that many cases of typhoid
fever, as well as other diseases, are
caused by eating shellfish obtained
from waters contaminated by sewage.
So serious was the evil. In the opinion
of the commission, that the only sat
isfactory method of coping with it was
to confer on some competent authority
absolute jurisdiction over tidal waters
from which were taken shellfish for
human food, in order that no supplies
whatsoever should be derived from pol
luted waters. The commission also
realized that some definite standard of
purity must be established, as they
were able to find the bacillus coli, which
is considered to indicate the presence
of h_man pollution, in nearly all of
1000 oysters which were examined bac
terloTogically. As many of these speci
mens came from waters known to be
very pure, it presented a difficulty
which will require further research to
remove. It has, however, been demon
strated that shellfish should not be
grown, stored or fattened In water to
which any possible pollution may come.

Charlie Henke is a member of the

Charlie was Instructed to provide four

very dark, so a candle was procured
to read the music by, stuck upon a

out on the night air when suddenly Into
the lighted circle there sauntered a

ped up, and taking the candle, leis
urely proceeded to light his cigarette
with it. When he had obtained a sat
j Isfactory light he coolly blew out the
j candle, put it back on the post and

1 eclipsed musicians were choking with
rage, but their mouths being already
engaged with the â¢ instruments they
could not remonstrate. They gasped
and struggled heroically with the mu
sic, but to no avail. Like the candle,

To give examples of the domestica
tion of yellow journalism in the island
empire is not so difficult as it Is in
credible. The Japanese are a most
adaptive people. Western ideas appeal
to them strongly, and it seems that
psychologically they have much in
common with Americans. They are
quick to see a practical advantage and
quicker to apply it. With them, adver
tising, for instance, is carried on with
a perfection that makes the Westerner
marvel, and for the purpose of secur
ing advertising the yellow section has
copied all the latest stunts of the most
approved school for booming circula
tion. The plan of hiding bags of gold
in out of the way places and publish
ing stories in the paper giving clews
to the caches, which has been tried so
successfully by the London Mail and
several of the American newspapers
has borne Its full fruition in Japan.
Their method was to conceal a token
and publish in some obscure part of
the paper directions how to find it, the
finder of the token to receive a hand
some reward of so many yen. At once
this created a furor. It seemed as if
the native population was token-mad.
Of course there was nothing very re
markable about that. The same thing
happened in Boston last year. For
a time it divided attention with the
question of war. But doubts began to
arise about the honesty of the trans
action. Most of the papers had taken
It up and It seemed that they always
allowed a certain fixed time to elapse
between the publication of the an
nouncement and the time for the com
mencing of the search. When the crit
ical moment came It was generally
found that some one on the staff or
at least indirectly connected with the
paper got the token.
No sooner had this run its course
than the Chuo resorted to the Inevi
table lottery, which was held at the
end of each month for the benefit of its
subscribers, the prizes being 20 yen
debentures of the Industries Bank. The
Nlroku, with a policy truly American,
followed suit with more prizes and of
larger value. The Hochi, 'not to be
outdone, then put out the scheme that
worked the best of all. It was the old
promise of a prize to any one who
could discover the typograpical error
in its advertising sheet. When it be
came known that the ads of Hochi
would be read carefully by a large
number of people, it at once Jumped
into first place as a medium. The mer
chants, seeing how the lottery ticket
craze brought business -to the papers,
at once began to advertise that with
certain amounts of goods purchased
lottery tickets would be given away
and it had all the desired effect that
doubling the number of green trading
stamps has in this country. For the
time Tokio was lottery-mad. Finally
the police were forced to interfere and
now yellow journalism is looking about
for some new thing that is not such a
flagrant violation of the anti-gambling
laws. But it paid while it lasted.
Like yellow journalism elsewhere,
after all the' funds for the poor and
*the bureaus for this and that are dis
counted, there is the news incident
ally. The retailing of delectable bits
of scandal, of course. Just at present,
takes the shape of violently sensational
war news, which is rushed on the street
of Tokio in the shape of extras with a
rapidity and unreliability that com
pares favorably .with Park row In the
days of the Spanish war. Everybody
â¢â¢eads these extras and, strange to say.
It is not to be understood, however,
that the entire Japanese press is yel
low. Far from it. There are at least
three notable exceptions which would
rank high in journalism under any civ
ilization. Cut the majority of papers
of Tokio and Yokohama have evolved
characters that would do credit to any
yellow journal here. This section of
the Japanese press is young, and is
sowing Us wild oats with a zest that
would make the most blase of New
York yellow journalists green with
envy.
Of course, the rubbing* in is done in
the most polite fashion, the Dempo ed
itor expressing himself something like
this: "It gave most base me very great
pleasure, most honorable editor of the
divine Chuo, to see that your most au
gust Journal deigned honorably to quote
from my vile Dempo a mean paragraph
this morning." And without the faint
est intention of sarcasm, either! Of
course, this self-abasement Is mere
form â the Japanese could not be other
than polite or display the slightest an
noyance if he tried â but in nine cases
out of ten the honorable editor of the
Dempo is right when he calls his jour
nal "vile," and the paragraph "base."
For Japan is in the grip of a "yellow
peril" in journalism which would send
a. Democratic convention fleeing in
panic from Chicago to Cape Horn, in
stead of stopping at St. Louis.
Few Americans realize to what an ex
tent the dally newspaper has grown in
the last decade In "little" Japan, with
her 40,000,000 people. In Tokio, for in
stance, there are no less than twelve
native daily papers, while the foreign
press of the capital and Yokohama is
valued at Eomething like 227.000 yen, a
yen being approximately 50 cents in
our money. Tokio has its press club
also, called the Japanese Journalists'
Union, where the knights of the fourth
estate meet to retail thrilling stories
of newspaper daring in eluding the
Russian press censor in Manchuria and
getting in a sensational beat for the
Dempo, which the Chuo pilfers in its
next issue.

might mean to his new industry, and
one morning he awoke to find that
every fox had escaped from the
island to the mainland and had taken
to the heavy growth of timber which
covers much of this section of the coast.
Mr. Skillings Instituted searches and
scoured the surrounding country, but
he has not succeeded in recovering ona
of the animals. The sixty foxes, many
of which were extremely valuable, ag
gregated an amount of man^ thousands
of dollars, and the loss give's every In
dication of being a total one.
It was shown ttyat the seizures of British/ ships were
the act of the United States, injurious to British sub
jects. We abided by the result and agreed upon a judi
cial arbitration of the indemnity, and when the award
was made we paid it. We then arbitrated with Russia
the seizures of American ships when she "was our partner
in the mare clausum. This arbitration was in the Hague
court, and Russia promptly paid the damages awarded.
In that transaction all claims have been arbitrated and
paid to the sufferers, except what the United States owes
to its own citizens for their ships and property confis
cated in Bering Sea. Of course justice and honor re
quire that these should be paid also.
Now here is a series of issues, each involving a casus
belli, that might have led to war in collection of debts,
had the losing nation refused to keep faith and abide by
the results of arbitration.
In individual litigation, before judicial courts,' every
judgment becomes a finality, because the. court, has the
power to enforce its decree. At that point the analogy
between judicial courts and international arbitrations
ceases. International -courts can render judgment but
cannot enforce execution. A newspaper, discussing -the
recent award at the Hague giving preference in payment
of the Venezuela claims to the blockading powers, la
ments that the blockading powers were not punished and
says: "The Hague court, like the rest of mankind, has
not outgrown respect for force. It would be a' most em
barrassing outcome were the. United States, as the friend
and promoter ofarbitration and protester against bom
bardment in international finance/herself to find it need
ful to do some bombarding."
That is more than a superficial view, it is foolish. If a
nation, party to arbitration,.' refuse to abide by it, what
good is arbitration unless there be power to enforce it?
What is needed just now to vindicate arbitration is rigid
enforcement of its judgments,, completing the analogy
between' judicial and arbitral courts. Our nationals' have
been despoiled byJthe Latin-American governments. The
spoliation has been arbitrated and the spoilers, have re
fused to pay the judgments. Unless there is power to
enforce such judgments, arbitration is a vain thing. The
United States should not flinch a 'moment in bombarding
the ports of any nation that sneaks out of paying such a
judgment, if our. citizens are concerned. Otherwise ar
bitration will fall into disuse, and the Hague s Pahce of
Peace will be a Palace of /oily. ,_ r
The arbitrators found Great Britain responsible for the
acts injurious to our citizens, and demanded that $15,
000,000 damages be paid to them by that Government.
Great Britain had agjeed by treaty to abide by the re
sults of arbitration. Had she refused to do so after the
award was made, it would have been a cause of war,
which again would have been the collection of private
debts by war. But. she" was honorably mindful of. her
obligation and faith, and promptly paid the award, which
was distributed to our injured citizens upon proof of
their losses. Next we arbitrated the fishery claims with
Great Britain, which were private debts, and when the
award was apainst us we paid it.
Another issue arose over the claim that Bering Sea
was a mare clausum. under the jurisdiction of the mu
nicipal law of the United States. Russia made the same
claim for her half of Bering Sea. Both Governments
seized and libeled the sealing ships of their own and
other nationals. Great Britain demanded of us indemnity
for the ships, stores and cargoes of her subjects that we
confiscated in Bering Sea. We refused, claiming that as
a marc clausum the law of the sea did not extend to those
waters. Here was another cause of war,. in which Great
Britain would have made war to collect private debts.
But both nations resorted to arbitration. The issue was
tried out in the Paris arbitration and was decided against
us. - - ' f. Â¦. , . ' -1" â¢
It is a principle of international law that when an in
jurious act is done or permitted by a government ftiat
government becomes responsible and must respond with
indemnify to the individual. ' At the close of our Civil
War we called on Great Britain to indemnify our citizens
for losses incurred in the seizures made on the-high seas
by the Alabama. England denied liability. Therefore we
could have declared war. which would have been war for
the collection of debts due individuals. But, instead, we
resorted to diplomacy and out of it issued the Geneva
arbitration. S!
THE plan of the Hague tribunal is most beneficent.
It provides a for. war, by projecting the
judicial process into issues *o which nations are a
party. Time was that in issues, between individuals the
only finality was a' trial of strength. For this the trial
by ordeal was substituted. Finally the judicial method
appeared by a process of evolution, and, the body of the
law grew* up. The law fixed the rights of person and
property, and the j courts applied its principles to all is
sues that affected either. But in issues between" r nations
the primitive method remained, and they were settled by
a trial of strength and were arbitrated by war.
The first step forward from this method of such mag
nitude as to attract the attention of the world was the
Alabama arbitration between the United States' and Great
Britain. The Confederate cruiser had been built, armed
and fitted out in an English port. Its building and per
mission to arm, coal and sail were in violation of Eng
land's, neutrality. The several acts were by the consent
of the British Government. They led to the injury of
American citizens, whose property at sea was lost as a
consequence of those acts.
"Oh, I don't mean In that way, part
ner," the reporter answered, "but let
me te,ll you; don't let that medical stu
dent .hand you any chloroform. I
wouldn't let him doctor a sick cat of
mine. He's a tramp and doesn't know
his business. He is working here for
glory and the only pay he receives
from the Board of Health is when he
performs an operation. He's got the
pull or he couldn't stay here a minute.
If he gets you under the influence you
can gamble that when you wake up
you'll be minus a limb."
"Well," said the faker, "just buy a
ticket that he will not operate on me.
I don't like his looks, anyhow." Inside
of ten seconds the man who was look-
Ing for damages had dressed himself
and was out on the street. And he
didn't move to funeral time at that.
The reporter, satisfied that the pa
tient was putting on all the. agony,
got close to him and in a. confidential
way remarked, "Say, old man, you are
certainly up against it."
"I know I am," he replied, "and the
railroad company will have to pay
dearly for this."
It is a strange thing how so many
people try to get on a damage suit
against the railroad company.

I'll. put on a dressing as a matter of
form."
Among Those Injured.
That unanimity of the press in fos
tering the war spirit in Japan was well
illustrated recently by a meeting of
Tokio and Osaka journalists who ad
vocated war, in the kowai-do "public
hall" of Osaka. There were over 2500
delegates present indulging in the most
impassioned- and inflammatory oratory,
appealing to national patriotism and
virtually calling for the resignation of
the Ministry.
To show how little the papers ac
tually knew of the status of affairs
the Shogyo Slumpo flatly contradicted
the Dempo and asserted that the Gov
ernment had "absolutely determined on
war unless its proposals were accepted
by Russia in toto." The Shogyo repre
sents the interests of the business men
of Japan. The Nippon, which repre
sents the extreme of Japanese chauvin
ism, took its stand along with the Dem
po. The Yomlruri, Hoehi, Chuo. Jim
inin and other minor journals also com
mitted themselves to policies uniting
abuse of the procrastinating Cabinet,
and loud applause of Koko Hironka,
who was the president of the proposed
Diet which was in open hostility to the
Government.
Whether the papers create the want
or the want the papers is too meta
physical a question, but the truth of
the situation js that the war spirit has
control-of everybody except those at
the head of the movement.
As if the existing: yellowness was not
deep-dyed enough another Journal has
entered the field which eclipses them
all. This is the Dempo (Telegraph),
which is at swords' points with the rest
of the press for not being yellow
enough. Its motto is. "Let us fight and
win, let us fight and lose, but let us
fight." How the paper exists is a won
der from a financial standpoint, for it
sells for 10 sen a month, which is,
roughly, one-twenty-fourth of a cent a
copy and with a circulation of 100,000
would yield only 334 yen daily. But it
is widely read and before the beginning
of the war grew daily more violent. One
of its recent utterances was that "the
government is prepared to yield every
thing to Russia." and the flowery
abuse of the Cabinet for this suppo
sititious policy was something fearful
and wonderful to read.
great Importance Is attached to every
thing that attains the sacredness of
print, despite the fact that each suc
cessive canard Is scarcely In type . be
fore it is contradicted. The only way
for one to avoid getting the most dis
torted news is to be read only the Jiji,
the Kokumin or the Asahi, and they are
only better because they discredit the
scare heads of the other papers. These
three papers represent the best conser
vative sentiment, but they are pow
erless to stem the tide of sensational
ism. The JiJl has adopted recently a
rather novel plan of overcoming' this
abuse of extras by publishing: the news
in its morning edition, with the proviso
that "unless something unusual de
velops, there will be no extras," the is
suing of an extra having become now
adays the rule rather than the excep
tion. Of Vourse, as the day advances,
most of the other papers flood the city
with extras, which are devoured rav
enously. Nobody seems, to notice or
to care for the fact that the absence
of a Jiji extra practically discredits the
news.
Already there have been prognosticated by the experts
the effects this engagemenf.will have upon, naval con
struction. When a* battleship of 15,000 tons and costing
three million dollars is just as liable to sudden extinc
tion as a cruiser, a lighter, swifter,' cheaper and more ef
fective machine in the exigencies of a long sea cam
paign, it is probable naval architects will begin to profit
by the fate of the Retvizan and Cesarevitch.and advocate
vessels which, if blown up, will not carry with them so
much treasure.
disputes of experts, seems to have. received partial solu
tion at Jeast^rom the action which opened the present
struggle on the' night of February, 8. At that' time Jap
anese torpedo-boats, by" making' a brave midnight dash
into the very center of the Russian fleet at Port Arthur,
succeeded 1 in 'disabling two " first-class battleships and a
cruiser with their explosives and escaping before the
guns of the'fleet could be turned upon them. These
craft were armed with the latest model of torpedo,
which is self' steeringand has such a motor power that,
even launched beyond- the limit | of effective searchlight
rays, it is reasonably sure to find its mark. The Japanese
torpedo-boats used on the Port Arthur attack were the
highest models of their class.
This action probably will go a long way to place defi
nitely the sphere of the. torpedo-boat' in the efficiency of
naval maneuvers. It must, be used as a night weapon,
for a sudden dash and away again, before the enemy can
recover from surprise. Our Spanish war demonstrated
conclusively enough the utter uselcssness of this craft in
a general daylight attack. When the battle off Santiago
was fought the Spanish. torpedo-boats, Furor and Pluton,
though making no endeavor to take the offensive, were
sunk by the converted yacht Gloucester before they had
proceeded two miles' from the harbor mouth.' The con
tention of many, of the experts on our own naval boards,
that the frailness of the torpedo-boat negated any capa
bility it might have for offense in daylight attack, seems
to have found confirmation in this instance. The Port
Arthur night .attack .has already been taken by the ex
perts, as an equally strong assurance that the torpedo
boat has nevertheless a very important place in naval
warfare.

Enjoyable Time Spent In Scottish Hall
at the First of a Scries or Staj
Parties.
The first of a series of stag parties
to be given this year by the officers of
the Caledonian Club to the members
was held in Scottish Hall on Friday
night after the business meeting. The
hall was crowded and three or four
hours were thoroughly enjoyed In
song, music, speech and dance. Chief
A. M. Macpherson presided and kept
the fun from flagging. The literary
committee, headed by First Chieftain
McGregor, had charge of the refresh

Among those that contributed to the
success of the event were Pipers Lind

E. Ross. James R. Watson, Andrew
McNair, Horace Cookson, Hugh Wil

The difficulty in damaging a war
balloon in midair was recently shown
by tests made in Austria. The ex
perimenters anchored a balloon at a
height cf 7000 feet and had cunners,
who had not been given the distance,
to try to disable it. It required twen
ty-two shots to find the range, even
approximate^', and not until the Bixtjr
fourth round was the balloon hit.
Burglary is one of the thriving local
industries to which the enterprising
Japanese has turned his attention and
applied his deft hand. Policeman
Small, to whom the tricks of, the
cracksman's trade are as an open
book", avers that the job performed
by M. Makimishi in the boarding
house of his countrywoman, Mrs. Y.
Simoto, at 465 Jessie street last Thurs
day night was almost artistic enough
to be of high caste Caucasian execu
tion. The only defect in Makimishi's
work was neglect to completely cover
his tracks and destroy the material
evidence of his guilt, but that is an
oversight of which tho most careful
and experienced American practition
ers are sometimes guilty, the police
man says.
Makimishi was one of Mrs. Simoto's
boarders and the prosecution alleges
that he took advantage of the facili
ties thus afforded him to plan and
execute the robbery of -which he stood
accused yesterday before Judge Con
lan. The door of the landlady's
boudoir and the lid of her trunk were
securely locked when the thief entered
the room by moans of a duplicate key
and with tho aid of a similar device
he opened the trunk and abstracted
therefrom the sum of $150 in gold and
silver coins and paper currency. Then
he relocked both box and door and
quietly departed with his plunder and
not for quite a while did Mrs. Simoto
learn of her loss.
Policeman Small investigated the
robbery and his suspicion turned to
Makimishi, but that person could not
be found. So the policeman engaged
a couple of small Japanese boys to
identify Makimishi and on Friday he
found his man in Chinatown and ar
rested him. On the prisoner's person
were found duplicate keys to Mrs.
Simoto's room and trunk, also 591 in
hard money and $6 in bills, which the
lady positively identified as her prop
erty.

After hearing all the foregoing facts
Judge Conlan continued the case till
Tuesday.
Lulu Simpson married one Miller on
! June 16, 1901. at Paso Robles and
I without undergoing the legal prelimi
; nary of being divorced she was wedded
| to William F. Eichler last Monday in
I this city. She thus committed bigamy,
{ but as Mr. Miller cannot be found to
Â¦ clinch a conviction she Is likely to go
! unpunished for that offense.
All this was developed yesterday be
â¢ fore Judge Fritz. Lulu, who is under
I 18 years of age, was arrested about a"
i week ago and charged with vagrancy
j by a policeman that found her in a
Barbary Coast dance j hall, and while
Â¦ the charge was pending Eichler went
; to the front and married her. Then
Â¦ her mother, who lives in Salinas Coun
Â¦ ty, was heard from to the effect that
! the young woman was ineligible to en
j ter matrimony with Eichler for two
j reasons â first, that she was under
; legal age; second, that she had never
! been divorced from Miller. Police in
i quiry at Lulu's home, fully corrobo
| rated the mother's assertions. Clerk
i Henderson of San Luis Obispo County
i said his records show the marriage to
J Miller and contain no entry of a di
i vorce.
Lulu is still in custody, but her dis
missal seems inevitable. Eichler
J wants to have the vagrancy and
i bigamy proceedings quashed and Lulu
j awarded to his protectorship and she
| is perfectly willing to regard her latest
j wedding as binding.

Morris Auerbach, who has attained
police notice through his penchant for
accosting strangers and abusing them
orally, was caught performing his act
Friday evening on Point Lobos avenue,
far from hia usual haunts, and yester
day morning Judge Mogan gave him
three months to ventilate his vitupera
tion in the County Jail.
Two pleas for leniency in behalf of
as many youthful lawbreakers as
cended to the bench of Cabaniss. John
H. O'Connor, aged 19, was convicted
of having obtained goods by falsely
representing that he was an employe
of Jepson Bros., whip manufacturers.
His petition for mercy might have
been more successful if the court had
riot remembered that a few months
ago he worked an i exactly similar
game by naming Xathan Dohrmann
& Co. as his employers. At that time
he and his mother begged tearfully
that he be given another chance and
he was given it. As the lad's attor
ney claimed that he was mentally un
sound the court has passed him- up to
the Lunacy Commission.
Grand larceny was the charge
against William Connelly, aged 21, ac
cused of stealing anvils from the AVil
merding School. William asked per
mission to plead guilty to petty lar
ceny, but as he had been convicted of
the minor offense on a previous occa
sion " his request was firmly declined
and the case continued.
Politics figures In the complaint of
M. Jasper McDonald against William
Bell and threatening to kill is the
charge on hearing before Judge Ca
baniss. McDonald was a member of
the Board of Park Commissioners
when that body decided it had no fur
ther need of Bell's services as a paint
er, and Bell ascribed his removal to
McDonald's influence. So when Mc-
Donald was retired from the board
Bell exulted, and when the two men
met on the street a few days ago the
painter uttered remarks that led to
his arrest.
McDonald alleges . that Bell said,
among other offensive things: "Now
we are on terms of equality, and I
have a good mind to cut your throat.
You cut my throat, and now " Mayor
Schmitz has cut yours." Mr. Forbes
a friend of }IcDonald t Intervened be
fore Bell could execute his cutting
threat, if its execution had ever been
seriously intended, and the arrest was
made. â¢
Judge. Cabaniss continued the case
for a week. Bell Is active in Butcher
town politics and once was a candi
date for, the State Senate.
Mrs. Mary Davis . informed Judga
Cabaniss that â¢W. F. Burke had mali
ciously cut down some carpets which
she hnd just washed %hd" suspended
from a clothesline" to flry, and that he
had added insult -to Injury by. calling
her a murderess.
W. F. Burke informed Judge Ca
baniss that Mrs. Mary Davis had hung
her soggy carpets in: such a way that
soiled water dripped from them upon
his freshly laundered linen and that
when he protested she sneeringly re
marked that none! of his children
looked in the least like him, thereby
insinuating that they were not his
children at all.
The parties are separate occupants
of a tenement at 436% Sixth street and
their mutual antipathy is said to.be
fierce and of long standing. . Mrs. Da
vis was tried and acquitted several
years ago on a charge of. having
caused the death of Mrs. Klein and
her child, who were killed by an ex
ploding lamp. It was this incident
that probably prompted Burke to call
Mrs. Davis a murderess.
After hearing both sides of the*
case Judge Cabaniss decided that the
honors were about even and ordered
a dismissal.
The two Rooney, brothers peddle fruit
in a single wagon, and so closely do
they resemble each other in persc-nal
appearance that the naked eye expe
riences difficulty in determining which
one of them is James and which one
John. At least that is what a police
man yesterday told Judge Mogan, be
fore whom James was accused of ply
ing his calling without a license. The
policeman also opined that the two
Rooneys had only one legal permit be
tween them and alternately used it
when occasion demanded. Each of
them had been overhauled before, but
not until Friday did " the asked for
license fail to materialize. James was
unable to produce when requested to
show his warrant for hawking orange3.
"James, you must get a license If
you intend to peddle fruit," said the
court. '.'This . two-Dromlos .business
cannot be worked with i impunity
any longer, for the argus eye
of the police is fixed on you and your
brother, and you might as well suc
cumb to the inevitable." . '
James promised to equip himself with
a license forthwith, and he was allowed
to go free. / .'>;;:
George Guerin and Frank . Carroll,
who stood up and robbed a man named
Joyce one night. last week on Bryant
street, were held to answer to the Su
perior Court by Judge Mogan, with
bail for each fixed at $4000. v John W.
Aiker, a pantryman aboard the river
steamer Constance, who entered state
rooms with, evidently, dishonest intent,
was also held to answer, the bail in
his case being set at $2000. .
Mrs. Maria Flores exhibited to Judge
Mogan a locket containing a portrait
of her 17-year-old son and also a like
ness of Miss Labrada Morales, who is
accused of having enticed the youth to
abandon the maternal roof at 217 Val
lejo street and dwell with her on Hinck

to by Mrs.* Flores, who confessed that

SLEEP IS PRICELESS.
But It Can Be Obtained by Simple
; Methods.
Are you. a hard worker? Are you
overcome with fatigue at the end of
.each day's labor and instead of retir-
ing to bed with a feeling: -of satisfac-
tion at the prospect of a night's re-
pose do you wait the hour of bedtime
with dread and shrinking?
Is it your unhappy lot to be awaken-
ed every night, Just after you have
dropped off to sleep, by an intense, un-
controllable, itching of the j rectum?
Do you then endeavor to relieve the
sensation by scratching so desperately
that the skin becomes raw and lacer-
ated and you finally sink into the sleep
of exhaustion? Â»
. If so, yo do not need to be told that
you are afflicted with itching piles.
You have probably tried every rem-
edy you could hear of, with but tem-
porary relief, if any, and have con-
cluded there was nothing left for you
but to drag out a miserable existence.
As a drowning man grasps at a straw,
so should you eagerly devour the
words of W. . O. Milbury, 70 Pearl
street, Reading, Mass.:
â¢ "I. am pleased to state that I bought
one 50-cent box of Pyramid Pile. Cure
at the drug store and used about one^
half of it, and it not only cured me of
itching piles, but also of constipation,
a trouble of about fifteen years' stand-
ing. I have tried almost everything
without any lasting benefit, but I can
honestly and truthfully state that
Pyramid Pile Cure has entirely cured
me, as I have had no return of that
terrible itching, which used to keep
me awake by- the hour, night after
night If the old trouble should ever
return I will know just what to do,
but I guess it won't, for it is now six
or seven months since I. first used this
wonderful remedy."
We vouch for the authenticity of
this testimonial, and, as Mr. Jlilbury
found relief and a cure, so you may also.
Do not delay, but buy a box and try it
to-nieht and do not allow any dealer,
to sell you "something just as. good."

He applied for a writ of habeas corpus
for his release, and through the care
lessness of a detctive who was sent
from Vancouver to take him back he
was discharged from custody by*3udge
Cook on December 2. as there were no
papers on which to hold him. That
same afternoon Chief Wittman received
a dfspatch to hold Ansell at all hazards,
but he had gone.
Ansell had the cool assurance not to
leave the city, but applied for and ob
tained the position. of bookkeeper' with
the Nonotuck Company. He told Man
ager Metzner that he had Just arrived
from Alaska. He is about 25 years of
age, short and slight build, light hair
and ruddy complexion, and is a fluent
talker.

i3 wanted by the police on a charge of
felony embezzlement." He has fled and
it is believed has gone to Chicago. The
police of that city have been notified
by wire to look out for him, and the
police in other cities of the East have
alao been asked to arrest him if he
should make his appearance there.
The complaining witness against An
se!l is William Metrner, manager of the
Nonotuck Silk Company, 535 Market
street. Ansell was employed by Metz
ner about three months ago as book
keeper. On February 29 Ansell received
$307 34 in cash and checks aggregating
$1400 to deposit with the Crocker-Wool
w6rth Bank.
He returned to the office with the
bank book, which purported to show
that the amount had been deposited.
Next morning Ansell did not appear at
the office, and on Friday it was dis
covered that he had not deposited the
money in bank, and. it is alleged, had
made a false entry in the bank book.
The checks had not been cashed and It
is presumed he had taken them with
him.
On November 19 last Ansell was ar
rested here on the arrival of the steam
er Umatilla on a dispatch from Chief
North of Vancouver, B. C, stating that
he was wanted there for forgery. He
had been employed as a clerk at the

proprietor and several of the- guests,

At each inspection there was a large
attendance of military men anxious to
note how the inspections were conduct
ed, and the consensus of opinion was
that the battalion had once .more dem
onstrated that it is under good Instruc
tion and maintains its standard of pro
ficiency.
DATES FOR INSPECTIONS
On Friday evening Adjutant General
Lauck was present at the inspection of
Battery D. He remained during the en
tire evening, examining thearmory, the
several battery quarters and the man
ner in which the Government and State
property Is cared for. ;
On that evening the battalion in
struction in first aid and care of. the'in-
Jured was unexpectedly demonstrated
through an unfortunate accident to one
of the men." who pierced- his eyelid
while removing the bayonet from his
piece. He . was Immediately removed
from the drill quarters by company
bearers and the injury examined by
Major Schmitt. of the division staff, who
is a physician, and before the examina
tion was concluded the battalion com
mander, Major Bush, had the first aid
packages and medicine chest in the
room for use of the surgeon. Captain
Emmal, the battalion surgeon, arrived
fifteen minutes after the accident, but
by that time remedies and bandages
had been applied. On the recommenda
tion of the surgeon the injured artiller
ist was removed to a sanitarium.
After muster the subalterns and non
coms were directed to drill the various
subdivisions in platoon drill, bayonet
drill, guard mount and setting-up'exer
cises. Each organization reported
promptly on the evening assigned to it,
and the appearance and movements of
each seemed to have created a favor
able impression on the inspectors, who
were unreserved m their praise of the
physique and personnel of the bat
talion.
The past week was a busy one for the
First Battalion of Artillery, N.'G. C,
as every. night but one was taken up
in the inspection and muster of the
command. The inspectors were Colonel
Thomas Wilhelm, U. S. A., acting, for
the. War Department, and Lieutenant
John; A. Koster for the State, assisted
by Lieutenant Mllliken, representing
the adjutant general's office in the ex
amination of "property for condemna
tion. Â¦ ' -.Â¦"," .
It was the most complete and closest
Inspection ever held, and in the opinion
of competent officers of the guard it
will be of incalculable benefit. Colonel
TVilhelm, while firm in "his examina
tions, by his suave manner wins the
confidence of the men and obtains an in
sight into their knowledge and'instruc
tion, where the usual brusque man
ner of inspecting officers fails. Colonel
Wilhelm, who is tall and has a very sol
dierly appearance,. Impresses the men,
and they strive to' emulate him in as
suming- the attitude a soldier should.
At 1 o'clock on the day for the in
spection of Battery A the commanding
officer was required to report at the
armory on Ellis street to be present at
a thorough examination of all the prop
erty and stores issued to him, as well
as of the books and papers of the com
mand. This occupied about three hours.
In the evening the organizations were
required to report punctually at 8
o'clock, and two hours were taken up
in the inspection and muster.

other on a height at the villa, a sort

"When we began our' experiments
over this distance of seven miles ' we
had no assurance that the contrivance
would work, and In order to know when
the instrument was touched at either

"We are doing work here that will
have an Important bearing on the
future of wireless transmission," he be
gan. "The first actual work was done
In 18S8, though I had made it a study
for some time previous. After some in
vestigation in that year I dropped the
subject, and for two years or more did
nothing. I was then at St. Ignatius Col
lege, where conditions were not favor
able for experiments. In the beginning
of 1903 the first experiments here were
carried on from the fathers' villa in the
Santa Cruz Mountains, a distance of
ceven miles. A common Ruhmkorff coil
was used, and the receiver was the or
dinary coherer, which was improved by
the addition of carbon and silver. The
coherer is a small glass tube, having
two metallic terminals or plugs of silver
inserted. These are separated by a
space in the tube, in which space the
powder of carbon and silver is secured.
This was invented by Branley and won

TELLS OF EXPERDIEVTS.
During the past three months the work
has been steadily pursued by Father
Bell and Professor Montgomery. Hav
ing" now practically completed their
preliminary investigations and the task
of conetructing such apparatus as â¢will
prove the commercial- value of their
BVBtem, Father Bell consented to make
the matter public
nection with Investigations made. ,It
â¢was through this precise inspection of
all phenomena encountered that these
biro delvers into the realm of scientific
electrical research were rewarded with
the discovery they will make public In
lectures to be given at College Hall as
soon as the application for letters pat
ent has been filed at Washington.
"More interesting yet, we discov
ered another effect, which we have
called 'the breathing of the magnet.'
This, so far as known, has never been
hinted at or remarked by any exper
imenter or investigator. It is a sound
to be likened only to a deep, regular
respiration. This 'breathing of . the
magnet' gives us an auditory manifes
tation through the medium of that
most delicate of all electrical instru
ments, the telephone, of the principle
actuating and underlying that instru
ment. It seems to be the soul' of the
instrument- It leads us Into knowl
edge of what takes place when the
oscillatory effect bv the aerial . line is
received and is translated into the
click which we hear in. the instrument.
This Is evidently the effect of the im
pression of the oscillatory wave on
this magnetic' breath, which is attrib-
"These experiments," he continued,
"satisfied us that we were on the right
track. We then began to build ap
paratus for sending messages longer
distances.- At first it was uphill work.
We had to make all our own appar
atus, for we had but little In the way
of financial resource back of us, and
have, little now. First we constructed
the transmitter, which is called the
Tesla oscillator. ' To operate this we
had to make a transformer for the,al
ternating current, which was done by
Mr. Montgomery and . myself.
. "With this transformer we use the
commercial current of the Standard
Electric Company, which Is * trans
formed from a pressure of 110 volts
as it comes into the house up to 20,
000 volts. This is the current used
in the oscillator, being further raised
to an approximate voltage of some
where between a million and a million
and a half.
BREATHING OF THE MAGNET.
"Lines were then run "from the in
struments to the top of the scientific
building, 120 feet, and to the roof of
the college theater. Then we oper
ated on these lines to secure syntony,
and messages were clearly transmit
ted within short ranges. We had a
task with oscillators. I do. not know
how many, but we made a number
before we got one that gave proper
oscillation. The receiving apparatus
required immense labor when we
turned our attention to that part. We
began with the ordinary coherer, then
constructed the magnetic detector of
Marconi and found mnrlced effects.
For instance, one of th? curious re
sults was that we v.ere able to tell
the quality of a current from a Ruhm-;
korff coll, whether positive or nega
tive.
plained; that light and electricity, be
ing related and causing" in transmis
sion a transverse molecular or atom
ical motion, travel at the same rate
through space. The light from the
college tower reached the villa heights
at the same instant that the electric
click was heard.
"Heretofore," continued Father Bell,
"the system used In sending and re
ceiving was the ordinary Marconi
method. To come to the vital part of
my story, we have discovered, or . In
vented, aside from this, a system of
wireless telegraphy quite distinct and
apart from the Marconi. or any other
method. Its possibilities are greater
and it Is capable of large development.
"We have not. the funds to cover the
cost of this development, "but we arc
confident that a complete, equipment
can be constructed for less than $3000.
The details of this system I cannot
speak ' of minutely, Dut as soon as
patents are secured or the application
is filed we will give to the public the
details of the construction and opera
tion through the press and in public
lectures at this institutionâ probably
during the present month. The lec
tures will deal with the Hertzian wave
ar.d its application to wireless tele
graphy. Many of the experiments of
the celebrated Professor Hertz, wltfch
are among the most beautiful known,
will be shown.
"In the scheme of wireless tel
egraphy Maxwell's - is the : underlying
principle. His was the mind of the
whole. Clerk Maxwell tried to estab
lish the relation of light and electric
ity, or rather the identification of elec
tromagnetlsm and light, â¢Â¦ which, he
claimed, were one. Experimental
proofs were wanting, â¢ however,' until
Hertz, by a series of most classic ex
periments, substantiated the views of
Maxwell. ; Then came ' the application
of the -Hertzian , wave to ,' wireless ; tel -
egraphy/by Popoffand Marconi. , We
have worked along these"' lines, and
will soon Â¦ be] prepared to show, the, re
sult of our Investigations."..'
Father Bell then explained his be
lief that electric waves In wireless
transmission do not pass through
large solids In the form of mountains,
but over them. For, instance, . the
slight rise of" the San Bruno hills has
rendered the transmission of "wire
less", to San Francisco a difficult thing
to accomplish, while on an open plain
or across a body of water, where, no
intervening obstruction occurs, trans
mission for long -distances Is easy.. It
is reasonable to infer that this condi
tion is accountable for the present ex
tensive use of. the wireless telegraph
on ocean-going vessels, while Its avail
ability on land in still attended with
difficulties.
SYSTEM IS DISTINCT.
"Then we mad^ the Caselli receiver,
the Branley 'Jigger,' a small tripod af
fair used as a- coherer, â¢ which goes
jigging, thus breaking the current and
producing: the click for transmission
of the message. Other receivers also
were made, the principle in which
depended on the occidation of sur
faces.
"We were not satisfied with these.
Accordingly we turned our attention
to a receiver of our own. This has been
completed. It is more delicate by far
than any of the others, and we have
tested it repeatedly. I cannot now
give you an account of it, for we de
sire to secure patents before disclosing
the details of its construction."

ments ever put on record in .the County
Clerk's office was filed yesterday by
Edith' May " Madde'n," def en'dant'lri" "the

John A. Madden, United army.
It ' purports Â¦ to be an "answer - to Cap-^
tain Madden's; complalntr and: it is' so
far. as it contains : a denial of the.
charges made by , Captain Madden.
Otherwise it. is a. denunciation of the
entire Madden family.- .The document

a line that' does not contain something
that* reflects 'on -the -honor '.of- the Mad

j'Mrs. Madden also alleges that her
husband never gave* her the kind treat
ment usually accorded a wife by a lov
ing husband. She says that from the
.time her first child was born. In Febru
ary. 1SS9. to September of the same year
he never so much as vouchsafed her a
kind- word. She says that though he
' knew of the death of the chl 1 . he never
even sent her a message of consolation
or a line of 'sympathy. "He even," says
Mrs. Madden, "delegated to a stranger
the task "of sending a Christmas' pres
ent to me. The stranger sent the pres
ent and also a bill for Its cost. He even,
when my baby was sick, compelled me
to carry' wood up two flights of stairs,
and once when'l was convalescing from
a' ; serious illness compelled me to walk,

had received orders from the doctor not
toi allow me to put my feet upon :the

her any. love. . On the contrary, she '
says, he * has [eyer placed her in hu
miliating positions by his conduct,
and -by -his- gross neglect of her and
her child has held her up to ridicule.

when at home and otherwise treated
her In such a way. that she has been
affronted, by others andmade the ob
ject, of the scorn of. the. public, "
â¢ .; : DUNNED FOR BILLS.
She says he never provided her with
the common necessaries of life or* with
sufficient clothing to keep- herself
warm and that for more than a year
he compelled her to live 'upon the
credit given her by tradespeople and
then when he had means refused to
pay more than half the bills she con
tracted. She says that she has always
been' dunned because of his neglect
and failure to act like a gentleman,
not only by the tradespeople, but by
his father. The latter, she says,
dunned her continually for the cost of
her board and lodging incurred while,
because of the neglect of his son, she
lived' at his home.
; In, one of , the several closely type
written pages devoted by Mrs. Madden
to her spouse she says that one of the
reasons her husband. did not provide
for her was his conduct in the army.
She says that he drank to such a de
gree-and so neglected his duties that
for several months at a time his salary
was retained by the Government. She
says. that upon his return to this city
in November, 1899. she learned this
fact and for a year after his arrival
here he received no salary. She says
that during all this time she got what
she needed in the- way of provisions
and clothing on credit.
Â» SAYS HE- IS - UNKEMPT.
Mrs. Madden' devotes more than a
page of her answer to Madden's per
sonal habits. She avers that he is a
heavy drinker, that he frequently gets
drunk on duty 'and carouses â¢ around
with women of little reputation or none
at all, and that he is "unkempt and
filthy, so much so that at times to re

CARGO FROM - THE DEEP. ' . ;
The best account of the work of the
wreckers was given last night by Vic
tor Killick, the 15-year-.oldsori of Fred
H. Killick, teacher of swimming at Su
tro Baths, near the^ cliff. The elder Kil
lick has been watching the operations
of the launch crew" for several -days
with great interest, in the -belief that
they probably had some connection
with the Rio. Yesterday morning he
sent his son Victor," who is a very intel
ligent lad and -familiar with scenes
along the sea- front, to watch â¢ the
wreckers during. the day. .Victor.* armed
with a powerful glass, proved a good
observer. His story" as told. last night
is as follows: . . ;.â¢Â»?-
STORY OF WRECKERS.
No positive evidence on; the subject
was "ever made-public. -> If the owners
knew, they kept silent. If. private in
vestigators* learned *. anything definite
of the dead ship's grave they, tQO, said
nothing.: Meanwhile the scores of .theo
ries formed ,for raising ship or cargo
when located came to nothing.
During the last fortnight residents in
the thinly, settled 'region overlooking
Fort Point have observed daily the
movements of a. steam launch which
came around the point and anchored or
made fast to a- buoy about a quarter of
a mile" southwest of Fort ' Winfleld
Scott. The- half-dozen men on" boa" rd
the launch, kept. .their.; own- .counsel,
however, and it has transpired only
within the. last twenty-four hours that
the mysterious party was . working in
the hope of salving the cargo of the
Rio. This leaked, 'out in ' spite of their
efforts to k'eep it a profound secret. .The
story current among a -few. men on the
water front yesterday was that divers
from the launch had found the Rio ly
ing on'her'side," that they had -attached
a line to her mizzerimast and a buoy
to this " line at the surface, and were
tying the launch to this buoy" each day
while they proceeded -with the work of
breaking into the hold. But "the iden
tity of the wreckers and the ownership
of the launch, as well as its name, have
been so well concealed that they are

The Pacific Mail steamer Rio de Ja

Gate on the' morning of Washington's
birthday, 1901. has at last, it is believed,
been located. Quietly, very quietly,
the raising of her cargo is said to have
been begun yesterday.
The "famous ship; bearing a precious
freight of bullion and merchandise and
a still more precious freight of 210 hu
man beings, struck a rock off Fort
Point at 5:20 a. m. Dense- fog over
hung land and sea at- that hour, and it
was Pilot Jordan's violation of the com
pany's rules' against entering a harbor
under such conditions that caused this,
the most horrifying disaster in the
maritime history of the Pacific Coast.

cargo was estimated - at the time ' to
have been worth $1,200,000, including
$600,000 in specie. The vessel, built in
1878, was valued at $700,000. 'â¢

Postmaster Fisk said yesterday that
he had not heard the contents of the
report, but he was confident that he
had demonstrated beyond question. the
necessity* for the addition of at least
thirty-one carriers to the present
working force.
Mr. Fisk lost no time in thoroughly
informing himself as to the wants of
the department and after considerable
investigation and calculation he con
cluded that at least thirty-one carriers
should be added to the present force
In order to do the work in a passably
satisfactory manner. In response to
his recommendation the Postmaster
General appointed Inspector Fisher of
New Orleans. Inspector Flavin of Spo
kane and Inspector Fredericks of Den
ver to visit this city and make a thor
ough investigation into the carrier de
livery here. Their labors were com
pleted about a week ago and their re
port i3 now in the hands of the Post
master General.
One of. the most serious problems
that engrossed' the> attention of Post
master Arthur G. Fisk upon his taking
charge of the office in this city was
the carrier delivery service. The un
precedentedly rapid growth of the city
since the national census was taken in
190,0 has made great demands upon
the letter-carrier service and it has
been found that a large addition must
be made to the force of carriers or all
attempts to deliver mail promptly
abandoned.

A young man named Richard Moore
was arrested last night by Police Of
ficers Nelson and Joy and charged
with burglary. Moore was discovered
in a room occupied by Richard'Nel
son in the Prescott House on Kearny
street. Kelson's wife, who is a large
woman, caught' him at work, and,
pouncing on the hapless burglar with
her 250 pounds avoirdupois, sat on him
until help arrived. Moore had se
cured seven cigars and a pair of wool
en socks. He is believed by the police
to be the man who has been- robbing
hotel rooms in that part of town for
some time past. : .

couple of lengths, Veterano was second
and the favorite third. Martin picked
the good going: on the outside with
Veterano, but Powell seemed to get
his dates mixed and drawing his whip
steered " Horatius into the deep foot
ing on the rail. Although little .Cross
waite, astride Grafter, looked tired, he
kept diligently at work digging his
heels into the outsider's ribe and
through sheer gameness the son of
Cicero led .Veterano over the line win
ner by a neck. Horatius. too, fought
it out gamely, but his mud handicap
proved too much, and while .closing
strongly, could not get up in time.
Ridden with any judgment at all he
could not have lost. The time was
3:58, seven seconds short of the rec
ord.
TITUS IS A SURPRISE.
Favorites had a hard inning of it,
Hainault alone being decorated with
brackets. Titus, a heavily backed long
shot, was put over the plate first by-
Johnny Butler, and barring this little
pleasantry, the books must have had
a profitable day.
Skip Me, an enigmatical sort of
mare that periodically has winning
â¢fits, captured the introductory Futur
ity course sprint. She was one of the
second choices and won ridden out
from Argot, the mount of Travers.
Dora I, the mild favorite, led almost
Martin's lethargic spell continued
on to the next race, his effort on Nonie
being extremely ludicrous. The mare
opened an 8 to 5 favorite, receding
to 13 to 5. Jack 'got her away from
the post poorly and apparently 'made
no endeavor to win. This made it
possible for a "killing" to be made on
Titus, a gelding owned by Dan Meek
and ridden by Tommy Butler. Open
ing at 30, the best obtainable about
this bottled up one at post time was
13. He went out in front, winning all
the way. .Our Pride, another long
shot, beat Foxy Grandpa a neck for
the place. Albemarle made a fairly
good showing to the stretch, where he
began falling back.
Travers rode perfect race on
Hainault, favorite for the fifth event,
disposing of Mlsty's Pride rather easily
at the wire. The latter mare was
strongly fancied by her stable folks
and cut out a sizzling pace. In the
run home the first choice* gradually
closed on her and had something left
as he passed the judges, nearly a
length to the good. Buxton finished
third on Mlmo. Evea G again ran a
'disappointing race. r â¢
It was difficult to tell almost which
one of the six starters in the final
mile and fifty yard selling affair really
was favorite at one stage of the bet
ting. Byronerdale had a slight call
as the horses were called out and fin
ished second. Keynote, which won a
race on the previous day, was again
successful. "Doc" Kyle's horse, with
C Smith on his back, passed the fa
vorite on the far turn and Was only
galloping at the" wire. Frank Woods,
carefuly ridden by Martin, ran a close
third. j

Jack Martin and his bundling meth

downfall of The Mist, favorite for the
two-year-old scramble at half a mile.
On the strength of her previous win
the filly .looked almost a certainty and
her odds fell from even to 1 to 10. As
the barrier was released Martin man

J. C. Cuneo. who conducts a cigar

SEXSATIOXAL FINISH FOR THE WATERHOUSE CUP EVENT YES
TERDAY' AT r OAKLAND RACETRACK/ THE WINNER AND THE
JOCKEY WHO PILOTED HIM CLEVERLY TO VICTORY.
In the island of Luzon there are near
ly a million acres of rolling pine land,
with no underbrush or tropical vegeta
tion, where the climate is like that of
the upper Alleghany Mountains in June.
The Kroo-boys (a tribe of aborigines
inhabiting the seacoast of Liberia), as
is well known in the shipping world,
are the West Coast seamen. They are
the stevedores and longshoremen of
Africa. :L -.^ v;r.;. v
. Mrs. C. W. Pilban," rooming: in the
Bradbury Hotel on Polk street, was
found unconscious and nearly asphyx
iated yesterday morning. The woman
has shown signs of despondency of late
and it is evident that she intended to
end her life. .Two hours later Paul
Moren, living at 105 Ellis street, was
found in the same condition. The
case of Moren was accidental. Both
will recover.
Were Nearly Asphyxiated.
The track was slow and each rider
was cautioned by. the different trainers
to right shy of the rail for at least eight
or ten feet, where the footing was
heavy and gluey. Jake Holtman expe
rienced no difficulty in sending them
away nicely aligned. For more than a
mile Outburst cut out the running, Rio
Shannon, Grafter and the field closely
bunched behind him. Just after passing
the clubhouse turn the second time
Crossvaite on Grafter was signaled to
go on. and he suddenly spurted, open
ing up a gap of fully a dozen lengths
over his company. Veterano and Hora
tius were the only ones able to respond
to urging, and flowly they mowed down
the outsider's big lead.
Entering the stretch the last time
Grafter's lead had been reduced to a

Modicum. Horton, The Way and Rio
Shannon were nibbled at. In all nine
horses faced the webbing.
Ac a rule, long distance events usu
ally see the winner finishing half an
hour in front, with an afternoon inter
vening before the arrival of the third
horse and the balance of the field. Not
s?o, however, with the Waterhouse cup,
at two and a quarter miles, which was
decided in gloomy, drizzling sort of
weather before a large attendance yes
ttrday at Oakland track.
Grafter, an 8 to 1 chance, crossed the
wire but a scant neck before Veterano,
the favorite Horatius third, less than
a leng-th farther back and closing on
the leaders. Of course, the other start
ers were strung out at the end, but it
was pretty juggling of weights on the
part of the handicapper, for the best
ones fought it out.
Grafter, the entry of Blasingame
Brothers of Fresno, was ridden by Ap
prentice Crosswaite, an unassuming lit
tle fellow, and he stole the race, which,
by the way, netted his employers $3325.
On the other hand, Iva Powell, who
rode Horatius, threw the race away on
the best horse. Jack Martin piloted
Veterano. and while he may have erred
in letting Crosswaite open too big a
gap, little fault could be found with his
work.

Favorites made almost a clean
sweep of the card, winning forty of
the forty-eight trials. The rain did
not seem to affect the hares, the ma
jority of the trials being fair tests of
the greyhounds. The results in detail,
with Judge Thomas Tlerne5 f 's official
scores, follow:
Heredine, a fawn-colored daughter of
the famous English greyhound Fabulous
Fortune, the sire of this year's Water
loo cup winner, won her trial cleverly
yesterday at Ingleside Coursing Park.
She was drawn against Glaucus, lead
ing and beating her decisively by a
score of six points to two.
Young Corbett has abandoned his
proposed automobile tour and will re
sume his training work to-morrow.
With Jimmy Britt nowadays it Is
work, work, work. Although the clever
boxer was in excellent trim when he
settled down to his training at Croll's
Gardens in Alameda five days ago, he
is not permitting any grass to grow be
neath his heels or adipose upon his
Adonis form. \ When Britt is not on
the .road he is in the room with the
punching bag or on the canvas with
his sparring partners, Fred Landers
and Frank Rafael. His other time is
taken up *vlth sleeping and eating.
Jimmy is an early bird- and soon after
the clock .strikes six he can be ob
served sprinting around the blocks in
the neighborhood of his training camp.
This is done before breakfast.
Britt went on the road yesterday
morning for his usual jaunt of ten
miles. After reaching his quarters
he was subjected the rubdown. In the
afternoon he donned the gloves with
Landers and Rafael and set out a
fast pace for his opponents. Fast
work does not apear to make any dif
ference to Jimmy even at this early
stage of his training, and this Is en
couraging to his admirers. To-morrow
Jimmy expects a crowd of Olympic
Club members and others over to visit
him and If all Is well they will prob
ably be afforded an opportunity to
watch him work out in the gymna
sium.

Hildebrand rode a ./stirring finish in
the fifth race on Iras, landing her first
by a neck from Ultruda, with Pla
tonius third. The little jockey just
put his fourth winner for the day
across in. the last race when Jane
Holly galloped home in front of Jim
Hale. Eugenie B got the show,
Weather fine; track fast. The sum
mary:
There was a big crowd in attendance
and the books had plenty of cash to
handle. Four favorites won, three of
them being odds-on. The other two
races went to second choices. Double
O was played to win the hurdle event,
but the weight was too much for him
and he stopped badly in the last six
teenth, allowing Heir Apparent and
Sir Hugh to beat him out.
Katherine Ennis had an easy thing
of it in the first race, winning by half
a dozen lengths from Skirmish, with
Andrattus third.
It is probable that Stuyve would
have won had he not suffered a bad
cut on his left hind leg in the crowd
ing on the first turn. He ran a game
race and was only beaten half a
length. His owner says the injury is
serious and Stuyve will be laid up for
several months. Rag Tag was a close
third at the finish. Mountain was
badly shaken up by his fall from Best
Man, but was able to ride in the last
race.
LOS ANGELES, March 5.â The San
Pedro selling stakes at one mile, the
gross value of which was $1760 and
the net $1390, was won by Warte

Xoii-Frateriiity Atliletes at
Stanford University Prove
Superior on the Track
STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March
5.â In the field day held this morning
between the fraternity and non-fra-Â«
ternity athletes, the latter bested the
Greek Letter men by the score of 73
points to 49. The track was rather
heavy, but the work of the men was
, good notwithstanding this drawback.
' The best performances were In the
mile run, broad Jump and shot put.
"Gay, '04, won the mile in 4:54, fast
time considering the condition of the
track. Thomson, '04, was a close sec
ond and Barrett, '04, a good third.
"Brick" West, '06, did 21 feet 8 inches
in the broad jump, the best effort in
that event this season. Hyde, '04,
showed ud in his usual good form in
j the shot-put, his best being 41 feet 11%
\ inches.
The Phoenix baseball team . of St.
Mary's defeated the nine of the Uni
versity of California here this after
noon by the score of ten runs to three.
It - was a slow game, as neither team
seemed to be on its mettle. An acci
dent in . the third inning marred the
play. Hlnkson of St. Mary's had his
leg broken below the: knee while try
ing to tag Bliss at the plate. There
were three men on bases and Wulzen
hit to right field. Adams, the Cali
fornia-captain, scored and attempted
to block the throw so that Bliss could
slide in. Hlnkson had one fott on the
plate and Bliss . crashed into, him,
throwing him over' Adams. The in
jured player was unable to move and
was taken to the Guild Hospital.
:Heitmuller was" wild and the St
Mary's team touched him up for ten '
safeties. In the third inning "Heine"
walked three men, was hit twice and
walked another, letting in five runs. ,
He has plenty of speed. (
The teams were made up of: , St
Marysâ Haley, Westerby, Hinkson,
Sweile, Ryan, Rooney, Scofteld, Aedina,
Ferguson and Domergue. California-
Adams, Bliss, Heitmuller, Strub, Wal

The day was won by the '07 athletes.
They ran up a total of 74 points and
only allowed the '06 men to get 48
points. About the only performance
of the day that merits noting was that
of Moody, '06, who first won the mile
run handily and then went into the

I'll Pay $1QOO to Any Weak Man
No matter what else has failed to cure him, if I cannot-makehim a stronger andxbetter man than he is with my newly improved
Electric Belt. This Belt is the marvel of electricians, having power enough to- give healthy vigor to any part of the body not totally
paralyzed.
Every weak man wants to feel young again ! To realize the joyous sparkle, of nerve life as it infuses the body with its.
glowing vitality; to feel the magnetic enthusiasm of youthful energy; to be happy, light-hearted and full of joyous impulses; to be
free from spells of despondency, from brain-wandering, from the dull, atupid feeling; to have confidence, self-esteem and the admira-
tion of men and' women! Such is the wish of the broken-down man, and it may be gratified.
Dr. TVlcLauehlirVs Electric Belt
Makes men noble ; it causes the nerves to tingle with the joyful exhilaration of youth ; it fills the heart with a feeling of gladness,
makes everything look bright and makes the nerves like bars of steel. â¢
It does this while you sleep/by pouring electricity, which is nature's energy, into your nerves and blood. Electricity is life
to the vital parts ; when they are weak it will make them strong.
It is truly the foundation of youth to men who have begun to feel older than they are. and It Is a fine thing: for an old man who wants to feel youn?. It
is over two years now since I got a letter from Mr. A. Crawford of Pokepama. Oregon. In which he said: "I asked you to send me something to make an old man
yountr. and you did. I have worn your Belt three months, and am as vigorous as I was when a young man. I am seventy years old and can do as much work as
I could at thirty-five." x " _^

"Four of the men sat down on .deck
at 12 o'clock and ate a. lunch. Then
they went to work again and kept It
up until 2:50. when they cut loose
and turning their launch toward the
bay disappeared rou^d the point.
"I was told by persons near the beach
that they had seen the launch out
there every day for the last two weeks.
"On the beach I found some wreck
age, Including a number of empty
boxes and kegs. Only one of them had
any marks that I could read. This
box was stamped: 'Records of U. S.
Sub. Trea.- 1900-1901.' I copied the in
scription. The date might indicate that
the box had been In the Rlo's cargo."
â¢ Young Killick's. clear and truthful
story points to the history of the Rio
since she sank beneath the waves. The
fated ship went down in the seaway off
the rocks west of Fort Point. Here
the tide often reaches a maximum of
seven or eight miles, and it is likely
that the vessel was swung > round
from her first location until she rested
finally against the rocks southwest of,
the point. Victor Killlck described the
anchoring ground of the launch seen
by him as close to the rocks which are
visible at this point. It would seem
that the wreck, if such it is, has not
been covered by sand. . .
Experienced sailors last night gave
full credit to the story of the raising
of the Rio's cargo.

PERSONAL.
The .Mechanics' Institute suffered a great
loss during the year In the death of Irving
M; Scott, who waÂ» formerly Its president, and
who waÂ» always a etanch friend of the Insti
tute. '
During the year we were enabled to Inaug
urate a Â§ystematlc course of lectures by es
tablishing the Mechanics' Institute as a uni
versity extension center. A course, of twelve
lectures on the French Re%-olution by Professor
H. Morse Stephens was provided, and the suc
cess of th)Â« experiment Is evidenced by - the
fact that our assembly hall Is too small for
the attendance and we are compelled to use
the art gallery of tho pavilion. Professor
Stephens, who la at the head of the depart
ment of university extension 'in Berkeley, has
assured us of his Intention to further develop
these courses of lecture*. At present he Is
considering the advisability of a short course
to be given by ' some of the pronÂ»inÂ«!nt men
who will be connected with the summer school
at the university.
We sometimes hear complaints, and perhaps
the only cause for a great many resignations
Is our inability to supply the latest works of
fiction to every member within a short time of
publication. A recent Investigation developed
the fact that of our large membership fulls
83 .per cent take out books. If we add to this
those members who belong merely for the sake
of visiting the chess room and a larger num
ber who prefer to read, in the library, we are
Justified In concluding that our entire member
ship is an active one.
The completion of the forty-ninth year of
the- existence of the Mechanics' Institute
brings no startling changes in the even tencr
of. its. way. Like all Institutions, this one
also; while it has not drifted away from Its
earliest purposes, â¢ has added greatly to -its
usefulness. It was originally formed by me
chanics for the purpose of supplying the great
need of a library for the mechanics of San
Francisco, but started with a Bible, the con
stitution cf the Cnlted States. Encyclopedia of
Architecture and "Curtis on Conveyancing,"
and stands to-day a library of great usefulness
in technology, commerce and general litera
ture. The technological portion of the li
brary has been dclevoped steadily, following a
well deflne*d plan and purpose.
The affiliation of the Technical Society has
been of the greatest benefit to that particular
branch of the library and its Buccecs suggests
the advisability and possibility of the forma
tion of an organization which would do as
much for our library of- commerce. I; have
not the least doubt that If properly managed
a society of those Interested In trade and
commerce could be formed and affiliated with
us. not only for the purpose of collecing books,
but the Mechanics* Institute wculd be ready to
provide a regular course of lectures by compe
tent university extension' lecturers. I Â¦ offer
this suggestion to the officers and members of
the Mechanics' Institute in the earnest hope
that It may be acted upon In the near future.
Our membership is. In my judgment, satis,
factory.
The annual, meeting of the mem
bers of the Mechanics* Institute was
held last night in the institute reading
roofti on the third floor of. the build
ing. The attendance was exceptional
ly large and the annual report of Pres
ident Randolph J. Taussig was lis
tened to with much attention.
From among the trustees selected
at the last quarterly meeting the fol
lowing officers of the institute, were
elected: Â¦ â¢
, President,. Rudolph J. Taussig; .vice
president, George H. Wailis; corre
sponding secretary, James H. Lyons;
recording secretary,' James' G. Spauld
ing; treasurer. Central Trust Com
pany.. Joseph M. Cummings, who has
for a long time filled the position of
general secretary with singular satis
faction to the institute and its mem
bers, succeeded himself in his old po
sition. ~ . . -. â¢._'Â¦-
The report of the secretary showed
a membership of 3257. During the
past year 43 88 new books have been
added to the library. There are now
90,908 volumes in the" library and dur
ing the year 14 7,840 books were circu
lated.
Two amendments to the constitution
were offered providing respectively
that twenty and twenty- five years'
membership In the institute shall en
title* one to life membership without
further fees. Xo action was taken on
the, proposals.
The report of President Taussig was
in part as follows:

Oakland Office San Francisco Call,
1118 Broadway, March 5.
Two hundred and fifty feet of Oak
land water front property sold here
at public auction to-day at $40,400.
The purchaser is C- H. Holbrook of
the San Francisco firm of Holbrook.
Merrill & Stetson. The bidding for
him was done by George W. Umbsen,
the real estate dealer. The land oc
cupies the space between Webster
street and the drawbridge and has a
depth of 390 feet.
For years the property has been the
subject of litigation and the sale to
day was the result of an order handed
down by the Supreme Court that the
land be sold and the proceeds divided
between Alice E. Doane, W. C. Par
sons and the heirs of the late John D.
Cameron.
.The sale is considered an Import
ant one here, as it is indicative of the
value of Oakland water front real
estate. Holbrook intends to make ex
tensive improvements on the land' and
will build wharves and warehouses
on It.
At present the premises are occu
pied by the Coos Bay Coal Company,
Charles H. Butler & Co., the Oakland
Wood and Coal Company, the Oregon
Coast and Navigation Company and
John Heithalt.
Before Oakland was thought of
Doane, Parsons and others occupied the
tide lands for oyster beds, and,- while
they have held possession of the prop
erty ever since, they have had to de
fend themselves against numerous
suits brought to dispossess them.
Joseph B. Lanktree, as referee, con
ducted the sale from the Courthouse
steps at noon to-day. W. C. Parsons,
Dr. W. D. Huntington. A. P. Holland
and Umbsen took part in the 'bidding.
In order to confrom to the descrip
tions and court instructions the land
was sold in two pieces. The first and
larger piece was put up and knocked
down to % Umbsen for $25,400. He also
got the second piece, paying $15,000.
He was evidently ready to pay more
and the others dropped out of the
competition an* let him take it. . .

One man and forty-eight horses lost
their lives in the fire at the City Hall
stables last night and one man was
Injured, while p.roperty to the amount
of J25,<H<0 was destroyed.
- The body of . Dennis Manning, the
missing stable-keeper, was found by
Aspistant Chief Engineer of the Fire
Department George McDonald at 4
o'clock this morning. It was general
ly believed last night that Manning
had Jtost his life, but 'it was not until
nearly daylight "that 4 the body was
found. The remains were at once
turned over to Deputy Coroner Quel-
Ijn. â¢'
When the firemen and F. W. Baker,
the proprietor" of the burned place, got
to work upon the ruins this morning
iV was ; discovered that forty-eight
horses had v been burned to death.
The horses were all kept in the sec
ond etory of the stable, as is usual in
stables of this kind." The fire started
immediately" under the run-way that
leads from the ground floor to the sec
ond story. Before the firemen could
"arrive this run-way was destroyed
and the horses in the second story
were absolutely doomed.
..." The position of the bodies discovered
this morning shows that some of the
horses in their death agony kicked
their shoes off In their terror of . the
fire.
The loss is estimated at about $23,000.
Baker had no Insurance. In addition
to his loss there will be the loss of
individual horse owners. Dr. W. S.
porter lost a fine saddle horse worth
several hundreds of dollars and a span
of carriage horses. Dr. C. H. Walker
lost a span and a buggy and Dr. H.
J. I.arkey lost two valuable horses.
The private losses will amount to over

There was practically no insurance
upon anything in the stables.
The men first realized that "they
had been robbed when the night
watchman called them this morning.
Then they saw the condition of their
room* and pockets and knew- that vis
itors had called during the night.
They forthwith hotinei the police/ bat
p.* there iÂ« no clew to the. burglars
ihere seerr.s to be little chance 'of
catching, them;- , ,.'..:'..".Â¦
From the. rooms of George McCar
thy. Joe Devinl and Frank Daly -the
burglars got. 5S$ in coin. This money
they took from beneath the men' as
they tlcjt. .a.r.i the i; boldness of this
work is what makes the victims think
that thfy rnun have, been dosed, with
chloroform" by men'that knew their
business. Â¦ NoiÂ»Â« of them heard a .noise
during. the night and .none .was dis
turbed in the least.
McCarthy lost $47 that was hidden
in the :Â»Jllow upon which .he. lay. De
vir.i lost $31 and DaJy $18. Besides
the ca?h all their tobacco, knives and
other trinkets; were 'stolen^ from, the
pockets of. their 'trousers and coats,
which were turned inside. out. . .
After reaching thÂ».deck th$ burg
lars began a. systematic looting of the
staterooms. In â¢even* room they visit
#*d they turned everything upside
down and the disorderly appearance
of the room* this morning shows how
thoroughly they searched for. valu
able?.
The burglars- boarded the Bteajner
by means of a gangplank- they ; ran
from tb* wharf to; tfte pafldle wheel,
up which they climbed -to the upper
deck. This mode of entrance accounts
lor the "deception of ihie night watch
man. \yho stayed at -the bow of the
vessel moEt of the r.!grht/ ' "* "
A band of enterprising "burglars
boarded the stern wheel steamer Res
olute at the WÂ«t' Berkeley, wharf late
last night and looted liie vessel Iron
stem to stern while the crew'slept on
and the night watchman wandered

mysterious about the robbery 'and the.

Isabella Maguire, the 12-year-old
truant, who a few months ago kept
the police on both sides of the bay
busy returning. her to her parents at
Golden Gate, is again in the juvenile
detention ward at the Receiving Hos
pital, having walked thirty miles in
order to get away from a family with
whom she was placed in San Joaquin
County by Juvenile, Probation Officer
C. Anita Whitney. .
It is believed the girl is Incorrigible
and probably she will be sent to a re
formatory Monday. She stole various
amounts from her mother, aggregat
ing $80, and one night was found try
ing to find a sleeping place in a car
barn near the Chutes in San Francisco.
After numerous promises to be good,
which were broken as soon as the op
portunity offered, she was taken from
her home and sent away to live with
a family out in the country.
She tired of rural scenes night be
fore last and walked thirty miles into
the town of Gait. There the authori
ties took charge of her and in answer
to a communication was put on the
train and sent to Oakland, where she
was met by Policeman William Moore
this afternoon and locked up.

The strike situation in the local meat
markets* remains unchanged. Â¦ The big
ihops are running with reduced' forces
and are endeavoring to repla.ee the men
they have locked out with non-union
men: .-In the smaller shops the effect
of the' trouble is riot felt so keenly. The
'Â¦\ shops that have refused to join Jn with
j the boss butchers in their fight k.gainst
? the union men it Is said are doomed, as
Tin a short time they will be unable to
r get any .meat,. As an illustration of
! this C. F. Scheithe of '877 "6an Pablo
i avenue discharged his son this morning
! and Joined the ranks of the boss butch
i erF. and in his explanation of his action
said: "I could get no meat unless I
signed not to employ, a. union man. As
I must live, I could do no more than ac
ctpt the terms" offered me. My son is a
member of the unions hence I cannot
employ him." ',
Several policemen have been detailed
j to ,guaxd Becker's market In case of
any demonsÂ£ratlon. The butchers that
a>e' locked out claim that they are in
no hurry and that their union is the
best- organized in the town, and they
! express the belief that they can win.
â¢ At the present time there is no indica
tion' that the cooks and waiters will
| take a hand in the, fight. They have
held no regular meeting since the out
break of the trouble, and if . they can
render . materiaj assistance all the in
fluence that r can be brought to bear
upon them will be exerted within the
next few. days.'.," j '
The main strength of the boss butch
1 ers-.-lies' m the. fact that they have the
Â¦j wholesale men back of them. Becker
j received .word to-day from Miller &
Lux telllng-him *o keep up -the fight h*
j has started. The wholesalers have
'agreed not to supply any butcher that
1 employs union help. Notwithstanding
this several shops have refused to dls

HEAR REPORT
OF PRESIDENT
While acting as his own plumber
and endeavoring to repair a leaky, gas
fixture at his residence, 1721 Sixteenth
street, R. A. Smith caused . an explo
sion ofgas^which blew out all -the
windows in the front of the house and
painfully burned the amateur plumber.
Smith had been making some con
nections with the gas fixtures' in an
upper front room and did not notice
that he had allowed a large amount of
gas to escape. He left* the room for
a short time and on returning out
of the fresh air he discovered a strong
odor of gas. Thinking that one of the
connections was leaking he struck a
match to search 'for the leak and the
gas In the room exploded -with -a loud
report, smashing nearly every window
in the house, setting fire to some lace
curtains and seriously burning Smith.
The fire was extinguished with little
damage.

Letters were eeut yesterday to Con
gressmen Needham, Livernash and

Supervisors' Public Utilities Commit
tee requesting that the bill granting
reservoir sites In a forest reservation
to San Francisco be Â«*iven their most
careful consideration.
Braunhart states that when it be
comes apparent to the people of Tur
lock and Modesto irrigation districts
that the proposed storage of water by
San Francisco will result in direct
benefit to them the people of the val
ley, instead of opposing San Fran
cisco's application for. water rights,
will favor the same. The letter con
tinues:
"It must be evident that the districts
can benefit by water storage in forest
reservations only in the event of fa
vorable action by the Secretary: of the
Interior or by, Congress in matters of
such applications as our own. Relat
ing: to :these two reservoir sitesâ
Hetch-Hetchy an'4 Lake Elinorâ San
Francisco will ilways tlaim the first
right to" use them. The amount of
waste flood water to be stored In San
Francisco will be of such great,quan
tity that for a quarter of a century or
more large amounts of surplus can
annually be liberated to flow down the
natural stream and should prove of
great value to the; irrigation districts.
When the districts come to appreciate
this fact their j Representative \ should
be in favor of the carrying out of the
storage works by San Francisco * and
not be opposed thereto."

â¢i
The Bauer enthusiasm reached a |
Bort of Creatore climax yesterday af- ]
ternoon at the third and last of the 5
famous pianist's recitals. Lyric Hall j
was crowded to its capacity and the
appreciation was furorie. ! Beethoven's :
A fiat major sonata began the pro- !
gramme, a city of exquisite pictures.
Vastly interesting this sonata, in its
foreshadowing of Chopin, in the lus- ,
clous links of chord successions, the j
tuberose richness of the Arioso mel- |
ody. It was al# deliciously given, not )
forgetting the titillant humor of the j
fugue. The programme held yet an- j
other, seldom heard jewel from the Â¦
Beethoven. casket, the opus 129 rondo, j
of which Mr. Weil says in his lumin- !
ous little note, "to be really able to j
play it is to be able to play all Beeth- '
oven." Mr. Bauer plays it. '
The two Chopin numbers included j
the "big" .polonaise .in A flat major; j
In the sensational octave passage Mr. '
Bauer achieved a crescendo, after a !
flying pianissimo, that was simply !
overwhelming. Picture - making of I
the finest, a. glittering pageantry of J
sound, the interpretation left no ideal
of the work unsatisfied. One was a
little disappointed at the substitution
of the Schumann toccata for the Bach
D minor, but that was not Mr. Bauer's
fault. A printer of eminently proper
ideals- programmed the pianist for j
Bach. Mr. Bauer's close affinity for i
Schumann was again to be richly rec- !
ognixed in the.toccato, however; also,
verily. In the Novellett and ''In der,
Nacht." The elegant caprice of thÂ©
8aint-Saens Etude en forme de Valse
was just as subtly felt, and the' thir
teenth Hungarian rhapsody of Lizst,
played with a display of virtuosity,
atone that wonderfully never thinned,
found the bottom in its most 7 fiendish
passages, closed the programme. And
Mr. Bauer, madly encored, left us with
a little bit of Bach, D major prelude
and fugue.
It has been arranged for the good
of our souls that the pianist will give
yet two more recitals, the second a
request programme, on his return
from Los Angeles, on Tuesday and
Wednesday 'of next week. . '
GREAT CROWD ;
HEARS BAUER'S
FINAL RECITAL
The court thanked the Jury for the
fidelity which the members had dis
played and the expedition with which
they had completed the business of
the term.
A true bill was brought against Marsillio
Vanni. better known aa V. PUa. for having in
his possession a steel die used for manufac
turing- counterfeit dollar*. His ball was fixed
at $50C0. Erick Blade was indicted on seven
counts clwjrtng: him with counterfeiting and
uttering quarter dollars and nickel pieces at
Truekee on February 8 of this year.
Thomas F. Reynolds, a postofflce clerk at
Redding, wan Indicted for embezzling Wells-
Fargo & Co. money orders. United States
postal money orders *nd bank drafts which he
took out of letters addressed to Louis Tausalg
&. Co., Newman * Levinson. Lane & Connelly
and other San Francisco merchants. All these
embexzlernents were alleged to have been com
mitted on February 18 and amounted to several
hundred dollars. ' . Â¦ Â¦
We furtherntcra wish to call your Honor's
attention to the follow in? resolution, unani
mously passed by thÂ» Jury.
â¢"Whereas. Edward J. Banning. First As
sistant United States Attorney, has been called
to his last rest: and.
'Â¦>vhÂ»ri"a.Â«. Mr. Banning has in his official
position, as legal adviser to ihls Grand Jury,
rendered valuable services and shown true
ability, zeal and devotion to duty, and has at
all times been courteous and obliging; there
fore, >e It '
"Resolved, That we eipress our apprecia
tion of the ability and sterling worth of Mr.
Banning; that in hlÂ« death the United States
has lost an able, trustworthy officer and San
Francisco on upright, loyal citizen; and be It
further
"Resolved. That these resolutions be spread
upon the minute* of this Grand Jury."
Indictments were reported as fol
lows: 4<'.C-.'
0
W. F. Dasha. Thomas J.- Dempsey. Thomas
T. Burnett and Lee Lim, for . corruptly con
spiring to land Chinese Illegally. It is charged
that on July. 1 of last year. Lee Lim paid to
the accused an unknown sum of money, for tho
purpose of Inducing them to substitute an un
known number of Chinese persons, whose
names arÂ« unknown to the Jury, for other un
known Chinese persons who had been ordered
deported. Â¦ i
Shortly after the indictments had been re
ported Lee Llm was surrendered Into custody
and was released on $3000 bonds.
â¢ Before closing this report the Jury wishes to
express Its sense of appreciation of the cour
tesies received at the hands of United State*
District Attorney Marshall B. Woodwcrth and
his assistants â Messrs. V. E. McKlnlay and
B. I* McKlnleyâ whose ability and skill in
handling the various cases brought before the
jury have done much to expedite and lighten
the work of Investigation.
We alro'wish to compliment Special Agent
Ceerxe W. Hazen upon the ability hÂ« has
shown in collecting evidence and the capture
of criminals.
Well deserved by the living and the
dead were the resolutions unanimous
ly adopted by the United States Grand
Jury yesterday when that body sub
mitted its final report to United States
District Judge de Haven. After report
ing upon the indictments found and
charges ignored during the term the
report went on to say:
At an evangelical service at Glasgow
recently the preacher, at the end of his
address, cried: "Now, all you good peo
ple who mean to go to heaven with me,
stand up!" With a- surge of enthusi
asm the audience rprang to its feet
all but an old Scotchman in the front
row. who sat still. The horrified evan
gelist wrung his hands, and, adressing
him, said, "My good man, my good
man, don't you want to go to heaven?"
Clear and deliberate came the answer,
"Aye, Awm gangln*. but no wi' a pair
â¢onally conducted palrty!"â Exchange.
Didn't Like the Company.
Again large quantities of stationery
and other supplies have been furnished
to the company by the Supervisors free
of cost, several hundred dollars' worth
of paper, pencils and other articles
having been used up in this way.
The Mayor thinks it is now time to call
a halt on the expenditures.
The result will be that the work of

been experting the books of the probate
department of the County Clerk's office,
in which, a large shortage was found,
will cease, as there will be no funds
available for the purpose.
Already several thousands of dollars
have been paid to the experting com
pany, and without any appreciable re
sult In the opinion of the Mayor.
The Mayor takes exception to the
fact that J. J. Hassell first secured the
contract to expert the city's books, and
as the work grew the company v/aa
formed and the work farmed or par
celed out to several clerks.
Mayor Schmitz notified the Board of
Supervisors yesterday that he had de
cided to withhold his approval of the
resolution appropriating the sum of
$1000 out of the urgent necessity fund
for the purpose of continuing the ex
pertlng of the books and accounts of
municipal departments.
The withholding of the Mayor's ap
proval means that the money cannot
be spent, as the charter provides that
authorizations for expenditures out of
the fund named can only be' made by
the votes of fourteen Supervisors and
the approval of the Mayor.

of the Society for the Prevention of

charge of the pound, for the month of
February.
He also asks that the court restrain
the Auditor from'auditing the demand

from cashing them. He bases his suit
on the ground that the charter pro

He claims that for the pumose of

segregated its demands and will pre
sent several small ones for approval
instead of one large one.

TLACE IS NOW IX COURTS
Louis Rodar, the proprietor, said that
he had purchased the house three years
ago for $150 and that it contained twen
ty-five rooms. ' Dr. William Merritt is
the owner of the building and lot. The
structure is jl three-story frame build
ing and was built in 1850. During the
early days it was regarded as one of
the fashionable lodging-houses of the
city.
Scores of pillows and coverlets that
once graced the show wjndow of some
house furnisher, but now reeking with
filth, all found their way into the wait
ing wagons. Some wit in the crowd
suggested to Dr. Hassler that he sta
tion a man at the door to keep the
stuff from walking upstairs again.
Dr. Hassler stated that the build-
Ing was unsafe, unsanitary and a
breeding, place for disease. The build
ing and contents had been condemned
by the Board of Health and during
the course of the coming week the
structure would be torn down. The
patrons of the place, were of the lower
class, with no regard for cleanliness.
The rooms rented for. 10 cents a night.
The news spread with great rapidity
and that portion of Howard street was
thrown into excitement, A crowd soon
collected and the sidewalk philosophers
dwelt upon the injustice of the munici
pal government.
The first thing to come sailing
through the air from one of the third
story windows was a bedstead that in
the dim past was "a thing of beauty
and a joy forever." Then followed a
perfect rain of household effects from
lace curtains to a kitchen table. Two
wagons .were in waiting made several
trips with the remains of a once happy
home to the dumping at the
foot of Sixth street.
Pursuant to condemnation proceed
ings of the. Board of Health, a dozen
laborers under the command of Fore
man John Butler and directed by Dr.
William ' C. Hassler sv.ooped down on
the Chicago. He-use, 612 Howard street,
at 8 o'clock yesterday morning. After
arousing the few sleeping inmates they
proceeded to throw the goods and chat
tels of Landlord Louis Rodar through
the windows to the sidewalk.
H rtsults from the state of the law that
the beard may increase the salaries of teach
â¢rs in the preparation of its schedule between
the tirpt Riid twenty-first days of May and
that it may by and with the consent of the
teacher withhold and pay Into the annuity and
retirement fund as a contribution thereto such
amount a* the teacher may consent to con
tribute. After an anxious examination of the
law with a view to the relief of the fund, I
am unable to reach any. other conclusion con
sistent with the law and the rights of the
teachers thereunder. Â¦. ,- .
Finally you inquire, "Would a State law, he
operative In the city in nuch cases, if not al
loweble under the charter?"
What has been said in reply to your first
Inquiry anticipates the answer to this. The
charter provisions are effective in relation to
your department on."y so far as they are not in
conflict with State law. It follows from this
that the State law is supreme. Since there
is in existence a valid State law establishes
the annuity and retiment fund, and providing
for the payment of $12 In each school year out
cf the salary of each teacher subject to its
burdens into that fund, there would appear to
be no leijal reason why the Legislature might
not rai*e that amount to $24 In such school
year. I. "therefore, answer this question in
the affirmative.
MAY RAISE SALARIES.
The power granted by the charter "to with
hold for gcod and sufficient cause the whole or
any part of the wagts, salary or compensation
of any person or persons" employed by the
board Is not without ita limitations, and. in
my opinion. Is conferred for the -sole purpose
of aiding in the "Imposition "of penalties end
fines for insubordination. tardlne3E, etc., com
mitted by the teacher. It has no reference to
the retention of any part of the salary of a
teacher who has done his or her. full duty
promptly and faithfully and In subordination to
the rules and regulations of the department.
Certainly it was not Intended to placÂ« in the
hands of the Board of Education the disposi
tion, without the teacher's consent, of any
part of her salary for other than -"pood and
sufficient cause." and the appropriation of the
salary or part thereof to a charitable purpose,
however worthy, is not within the intent of
the section. When, however, , any portion of
the salary is withheld "for good and sufficient
caufe," i. e.. caure â¢ relating to the discipline
of the department, one-half of the amount
withheld must be paid Into, the annuity and
retirement fund. In accordance with the pro
visions or section 10 of the amendatory act of
19C3. .
Under this ffrant of power, which Is in no
manner . inconsistent with tbe general State
law. the Board of Education is the sole judg*
of the amount which shell be paid for the
performance of the services of a teacher,
which amount may be increased or decreased
as the board may determine. The manner in
which this power is to be exercised is de
fined by subsequent provisions of the same
chapter, which make it necessary that the
board chall, in April of each year, furnish the
Auditor with an estimate of the amount which
should be set apart from the common school
fund to the payment of teachers' salaries (sub
division 9 of section 1) and the board is re
quired "between the first and twenty-first days
of May of each year," to "adopt a schedule
of salaries for the next ensuing fiscal year
for teacher* and all employes of the school
department." (Action 4.) '
In May of each year, therefore, the boaid
may increase the salaries of teachers in such
amount aÂ» it may elect, but I know of' no
authority for the imposition of any conditions
upon which such increase may be made to
depend. Certainly no such increase can be
ordered upon the condition that the recipient
should pay a part or the whole of the- In
crease into a special fund, whether that fund
be established by law for the very worthy
object of providing: for the support of retired
teachers or for a leas worthy object. As, we
have wrn the limit of the amount which may
bo retained from the salary of a teacher,
without her conwnt, is 112 In each school year
(section 10 of act of 1U03. statutes 190't. page
278). and this limitation Is as applicable to
a salary which has bÂ«en Increased by | the
Board of Education as -it is .to the original
salary. - Â¦
POWER IX CHARTER.
BOARD SOLE JUDGE.
The .Board of. Education can' lexally devote
any portion of a teacher"* salary to the an
nuity lynd with the. teacher's consent, but no
greater amount than $12 per year can be
withheld Â¦ without the teacher's consent.
You inquire "Can the board make such order
by raising the ?alarieÂ« of teachers?" Â¦ By
"such order" I assume you' mean an order
withhoMinK a portion of a teacher's salary; for
the benefit of the fund In '.excess of ti" in
each school year, "nuch ordtr" to . accompany
a raise of the teacher's salary. ;
Subdivision 2 of Section I of chapter ' 111

Â»Â¦ ..Miss Alice Bailey, of Atlanta, Ga., Hi
tells how she was permanently cured of
inflammation of the ovaries, and escaped
the surgeon's knife, by the use of
Lydia E* Pinkham f s Vegetable Compound*
The universal indications of the approach of woman's great enemy, inflam-
mation and disease of the ovaries, are a dull throbbing pain, accompanied by
a senss of tenderness and heat low down in the Bide, with occasional
shooting- pains. On examination it may be found that the region of pain will
show some swelling This is the first stage of inflammation of the ovaries.
u Dear Mes. Pixkham :â I -wish to express my gratitude for the
restored health and happiness Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com-
pound has brought into my life.
a I had suffered for three years -with terrible pains at the time of
menstruation, and did not know -what the trouble was until. the doctor
pronounced it inflammation of the ovaries, and proposed an operation.
"I felt so weak and sick that I felt sure that I could not survive the
ordeal, and so I told him that I \rould not undergo it. The following
week I read an advertisement in the paper of your V egetable Compound
in such an emergency, and so I decided to try it. Great was my joy tc
find that I actually unproved after taking two bottles, so I kept taking
it for ten weeks, and at the end of that tune I was cured. I had gained
eighteen pounds and was in excellent health, and am now.
"You surely deserve great success, and you have my very best
wishes." â Miss Alice Bailey, 50 North Boulevard, Atlanta, Ga.
Another woman saved from a surgical operation by Lydia E.

Misconduct on the part of his wife
is alleged by Joseph V. Pidgeon, who
is seeking a divorce from Mable Pid
geon. He accuses her of belns too fa
miliar with William Baird. The Pid
geons were married in 1897 and have
one child, a girl, 4 years of age, the
custody of whom Pidgeon asks for.
Clara Decker is the plaintiff in a
suit for divorce â¢ in which Frank
Decker is the defendant. Desertion
is the charge made by Mrs. Decker.
Habitual intemperance and neglect are
the grounds named in the complaint
flled*by Jennie W. Seavier against F.
Seavier. Divorces are also being
sought for by Ella F. Bailey from W.
H. Bailey for desertion and George
Phillips from Lillie Phillips for in
temperance.
Charles J. Porter is seeking a di
vorce from Edith Porter, nee Biller,
on statutory grounds. Porters
were married at Chicago in 1900. They
lived there a year and then moved to
Sqokane, where they also remained a
year. Since leaving the northern city
they have been residents of San Fran
cisco.
Roncovieri's plan is designed to put
a stop to what he considers a full
fledged padrone system in vogue
among some Sicilian residents and he
purposes that the boys who peddle
shall at least attend school in the
evening, if not during the day.
Divorce Complaints.
President Roncovieri of the Board
of Educati6n has hit upon an Ingen
ious plan to ascertain If the' Italian
boys who peddle lemons and matches
during the dJfy attend the evening
schools regularly. Roncovieri has
had attendance cards for the public
evening school pupils printed with the
dates posted thereon. Each night that
the pupil attends school the teacher
punches the corresponding date.
The cards are to be carried at all
times by the pupils and they must
show them to the truant officers when
requested. At a glance the truant of
ficer may learn from the punched
dates if the boy hal attended school
and if he has not he is at once brought
before the Juvenile Court under the
compulsory education law. The cards
are signed by the teacher and the prin
cipal of the school.

The estate in question, according to
the Inventory, consists of 55343 in cash
and realty in Yolo, Madera, Slskiyou,
Colusa, Shasta and Alameda counties of
a total value of J30.S13.
The will of Dungan was j made in
April, 1898. It is in the handwriting
of the deceased and contains the an
nouncement that he died chlldess; that
he had never besn married, and that
he devised to his relatives and to any
one who proved relationship with him
the sum of $1. The rest of his estate
Is devised to Jane Whipple Robson,
who is also named as executrix of the
will.
The J3G.156 estate of the late Dr. Ja
cob S. Dungan, who was a retired naval
surgeon, is the subject of a contest
brought yesterday in the Probate Court
by his brother, Joseph Dungan, and
his nephew and niece, Harry L Dun
gan and Jane de Kalb. They ask
that the order admitting Dungan's
â¢will to pro-bate be revoked, and that
the letters testamentary heretofore is
sued to Jane Whipple Robson, sole
devisee in the will, be set aside. They
allege In support of their contest that
at the time the will was made the de
ceased was of unsound mind and under
the influence of the respondent, and
that, furthermore, the will is not a
legal document in that it was never
witnessed or signed by the deceased.
At the time of Dungan's death in
February of last year he was 84 years
of age. He had been out of the naval
service at that time for fifteen years
and was, according to his relatives, a
recluse. They allege that though in
his younger days Jie had been a man
of . refinement, the manner in which
he spent the last days of his life weak
ened his brain and caused him to pre
fer a life in a filthy room to the ease
and comfort his means would enable
him to secure. When he died, they say,
he was in a room littered with news
papers which he had spent years in
collecting. He was under the control
and domination of Jane Robson, they
say, and therefore in no way fit to
make a disposition of his property.

An exceptionally handsome Â¦Western Addi-
tion blcck has just been cut up Into 45 extra

: block Is near the corner of First ave. and
! California st.. and can easily be reached by

' off at First ave. The conditions surrouniltnic
, the sale of this property are different from
I the mann-r cf selling property of this enar-
: acter.
Mr. J. C. Jordan, the orrner, has Impo5Â»d
the following conditions, which are to be r*.g-
; Idly enforced:
I No building will bÂ« allowed on the bloc*
! which will cost less than $3000.
No building shall b* erected for objection-
; able purposes, including stores, livery stables.
j coa!yardÂ«. schools, churches, etc.
No three-story fiats will te allowed.
I If you want to secure a nice residence sit*
. or make a good investment the above comnvon-
sense restrictions will icsure not only the ad-
1 var.ee in value of lots In this block, but will
â¢ also protect any one who builds. Thousands
! of people in thÂ« past few years have built
? desirable homes and have teen damaged or
I ruined for the lack cf Just such protections.
! In all other large cities in th<Â» United States
' the best property is sold under similar cendi-
! tior.s, which are if benefit to af!.
Special attention is called to the large lots.
â¢ It is cheaper to build on a larxe lot than oa a
1 small one. as It does away with thÂ« unsightly
i and unsatisfactory light wells and shortens tl*Â»
; building, besides giving a more artistic appe&r-
; anee on the outside. The interior arrangement
â¢ Is much better and you sscura an abundanca
i of light and sun.
The large lotÂ» and the .restrictions under
â¢ which the land iÂ« sold will Insure good neigh-
bors and an advance In the value of your
. property. These, however, are not thÂ« only
facts which will advance th<Â» property. ThÂ«
block Is exceptionally well located, la level
and all the streets are graded, sewered and
maeadamlied and are all 80 feet wide. The
property is right on the line of the city'a
I growth and the prices a#k?d. $Â£0 to $55 a
; front foot, are extremely low. as property
; within a block cr two Is selling for frota two
! to three times the price asked for this.
An unusually splendid car service Is already
; at hand. Including the Eddy-et. electric, the-
Sacramento-st. cable, the Sutter and Clement-
si, line and the Geary and Callforaia-st. lines.
, The last two are soon ta be changsd lnts
i electric systems.
| These are only a few of the points to which
I we wish to call your attention. We urgently
I request you to make an Immediate Inspection
of this property, and believe that if you do
: you will agree with us that the property pn>-
, sents an unusual and unequaied opportunity
â¢ for either a homeseeker (including 2 fiats) as>
! well as an excellent Investment. If you will
look ahead for a year or two and take into
consideration the rapid growth of the city
in this direction you will undoubtedly become
: a purchaser.

Wheat and Other Grains.
WHEAT â The week closed with quiet mar
kets everywhere except at Chicago, which con
tinued unsettled, ,. rising from 92"Â«ic to 93^c,
falling back to 9lT_c and closing at Â»2}ie.
There was excellent buying of July, but the
pit crowd raided May.
Private wires to Mitchell, Mulcahy & Co.
said: "It looked some whet as If the interest
which supported prices yesterday w.as selling
on hard spcts. Liverpool was influenced by
the Ohio crop report and by the continued
strike in Argentina and showed a rather firm
tone. The morning's map showed do rain "in
the Southwest, although during the day slight
rains were reported, and conditions seem fa
vorable for more. There waa more conP.dcnce
in the buying and there Is a large outside hold
ing in this market. The Dally Trade Bulletin's
compilation -Of ' stocks of Wheat afloat and
from Europe and Argentina shows about
16,li00.000 bushels In excess of a year ago. ami
it is .thought that a complete statement of the
world's visible supply will show something
larger than last year. Primary receipts are
still running a large percentage over last year,
but the cash situation on .the whole is not a
healthy one. Of course, war and the winter
Wheat situation will be important factors.
With no further complications in the 'political
situation and with normal spring weather we
are inclined to thick prices are high enough
and that Wheat may be sold on the rallies."
This market continued dull, as nobody want
ed'to own any more Wheat than he could help
to-raorrcwâ tax daj\ Futures were lower.

Potatoes, Onions and Vegetables.
The Potato market was liberally supplied
with table varieties and closed the week dull,
with buyers holdinsr off In anticipation of
lower r>ricÂ«s. Eight carloads of Burbanks
j were received "from Oregon by rait and two
I carloads came In from Nevada. The Oregon
j steamer brousht down 9356 sacks, which had
not been marketed up to a late hour. The
market was bare of Sweets, but a "carload was
reported close at hand. Onions continued firm
at previous prices, with supplies limited. Green
j Onions were abundant and lower.
There were liberal receipts of \ vegetables,
but prices of most descriptions were steady
under a good demand, both for local use and
shipping. Repacked Mexican Tomatoes were
offering at $1 25^1 75 -per box, but moved
slowly owing to the abundance and compara

chiefly of old Hens and Roosters, were mar

was weak, except for strictly fancy young

j the supplies. The market was barely steady
i at the close, although there was very little on
j hand. Receipts of dressed Turkeys were only
' two cases and prices were largely nominal. A

Chicago closed the week higher. There has
been some liquidation of outside holdings, but
they are still large, and packers and traders
are seller* on the hard spots.
The Chicago letter of Mitchell. Mulcahy A
Co. says: "There is still a larg-- outside In
terest and no change in the attitude of the
packers toward the market. They are free
sellers on the hard spots stocks are already
large and the probability is that they will go
on Increasing quite rapidly. Demand is only
fair. We think provisions should be sold on
the rallies."

The Marconi Wireless Telegraph U lh# most marvelous and useful Invention
ever introduced. It not only does all that the telegraph and cable system will do,
but very-miffh more and at a fraction oÂ£ the expense. It is destined to coma into
mere general use than the telegraph, cab'.e and telephone systems, with their hun-
dreds - of millions of ' capitalization and millions uoon millions of dividends com-
bined. It will be a means of communication between every country, every city,
every town, every viila-rf. house, factory, store. ofncÂ« and farm, far Its cost Is
within the reach of every one and its use required by alL
It will be more profitable than shares of the Bell Telephone Company, Â¦whiefc.
Â¦ were first offered at $1 and afterward sold for more than $1000. Alt tn-restaent
of $100 then has yielded up to the present time $200,000.
The stock of the English Marconi Ccmoany was put out at 15 per share, and
since sold at $22 on the London Stock Exchange, an advance of 340 per cent. Ths
possibillties of the American Ccmpany ara much Kreater.
Xo enterprise has ever grown like the Marconi. Invented less thar> six years
ago and put into practical operation less than three. It has been indorsed by tha
leading nations of the world, employed by many Governments and used la their
Navies.
Indorsed by prominent men and the press off tha world.

Marconi Company have for some time past been working under an arrangement
similar to that concluded with the Western Union Ccmpany. The, Marconi Company
therefore now ha* -working connections with the two telegraph companies of tlw J9
